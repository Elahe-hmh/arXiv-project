observed during IVS and NRAO VCS sessions\nhave been compiled. The list includes source type, redshift and visual\nmagnitude (if available). In case of doubt detailed comment is provided. The\nlist of sources with their positions was taken from the Goddard VLBI\nastrometric catalog with addition of two ICRF-Ext.2 sources. At this stage the\nsource characteristics were mainly taken from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic\nDatabase (NED). 667 sources from our list are included into the IERS list.\nComparison has shown a significant difference in characteristics for about half\nof these 667 common sources. We compiled a list of frequently observed sources\nwithout known physical characteristics for urgent optical identification and\nspectrophotometric observations with large optical telescopes. This presented\nlist of physical characteristics can be used as a supplement material for the\nICRF-2, as well as a database for kinematic studies of the Universe and other\nrelated works, including scheduling of dedicated IVS programs.\n", "  The self-consistent model of classical field interactions formulated as the\ncounterpart of the quantum electroweak model leads to homogeneous boson ground\nstate solutions in presence of non-zero extended fermionic charge density\nfluctuations. Two different types of electroweak configurations of fields are\nanalyzed. The first one has non-zero electric and weak charge fluctuations. The\nsecond one is electrically uncharged but weakly charged. Both types of\nconfigurations have two physically interesting solutions which possess masses\nequal to 126.67 GeV at the value of the scalar fluctuation potential parameter\n$\\lambda$ equal to ~ 0.0652. The spin zero electrically uncharged droplet\nformed as a result of the decay of the charged one is interpreted as the ~\n126.5 GeV state found in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiment. (The other\ntwo configurations correspond to solutions with masses equal to 123.7 GeV and\n$\\lambda$ equal to ~ 0.0498 and thus the algebraic mean of the masses of two\ncentral solutions, i.e., 126.67 GeV and 123.7 GeV, is equal to 125.185 GeV.)\nThe problem of a mass of this kind of droplets will be considered on the basis\nof the phenomenon of the screening of the fluctuation of charges. Their masses\nare found in the thin wall approximation.\n", "  In a previous paper, we proved that the limit of the collection of possible\neigenvalues of output states of a random quantum channel is a deterministic,\ncompact set K_{k,t}. We also showed that the set K_{k,t} is obtained, up to an\nintersection, as the unit ball of the dual of a free compression norm. In this\npaper, we identify the maximum of l^p norms on the set K_{k,t} and prove that\nthe maximum is attained on a vector of shape (a,b,...,b) where a > b. In\nparticular, we compute the precise limit value of the minimum output entropy of\na single random quantum channel. As a corollary, we show that for any eps > 0,\nit is possible to obtain a violation for the additivity of the minimum output\nentropy for an output dimension as low as 183, and that for appropriate choice\nof parameters, the violation can be as large as log 2 - eps. Conversely, our\nresult implies that, with probability one, one does not obtain a violation of\nadditivity using conjugate random quantum channels and the Bell state, in\ndimension 182 and less.\n", "  Jets with a large radius $R\\gtrsim 1$ and grooming algorithms are widely used\nto fully capture the decay products of boosted heavy particles at the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC). Unlike most discriminating variables used in such\nstudies, the jet radius is usually not optimized for specific physics\nscenarios. This is because every jet configuration must be calibrated, insitu,\nto account for detector response and other experimental effects. One solution\nto enhance the availability of large-$R$ jet configurations used by the LHC\nexperiments is {\\it jet re-clustering}. Jet re-clustering introduces an\nintermediate scale $r<R$ at which jets are calibrated and used as the inputs to\nreconstruct large radius jets. In this paper we systematically study and\npropose new jet re-clustering configurations and show that re-clustered large\nradius jets have essentially the same jet mass performance as large radius\ngroomed jets. Jet re-clustering has the benefit that no additional large-R\ncalibration is necessary, allowing the re-clustered large radius parameter to\nbe optimized in the context of specific precision measurements or searches for\nnew physics.\n", "  Between the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the LHC, hundreds of individual\nevent selections have been measured in the data to look for evidence of\nsupersymmetry at a center of mass energy of 8 TeV. While there is currently no\nsignificant evidence for any particular model of supersymmetry, the large\nnumber of searches should have produced some large statistical fluctuations. By\nanalyzing the distribution of p-values from the various searches, we determine\nthat the number of excesses is consistent with the Standard Model only\nhypothesis. However, we do find a shortage of signal regions with far fewer\nobserved events than expected in both the ATLAS and CMS datasets (at\n$1.65\\sigma$ and $2.77\\sigma$, respectively). While not as compelling as a\nsurplus of excesses, the lack of deficits could be a hint of new physics\nalready in the 8 TeV datasets.\n", "  The class QMA plays a fundamental role in quantum complexity theory and it\nhas found surprising connections to condensed matter physics and in particular\nin the study of the minimum energy of quantum systems. In this paper, we\nfurther investigate the class QMA and its related class QCMA by asking what\nmakes quantum witnesses potentially more powerful than classical ones. We\nprovide a definition of a new class, SQMA, where we restrict the possible\nquantum witnesses to the \"simpler\" subset states, i.e. a uniform superposition\nover the elements of a subset of n-bit strings. Surprisingly, we prove that\nthis class is equal to QMA, hence providing a new characterisation of the class\nQMA. We also prove the analogous result for QMA(2) and describe a new complete\nproblem for QMA and a stronger lower bound for the class QMA$_1$.\n", "  We study metanetworks arising in genotype and phenotype spaces, in the\ncontext of a model population of Boolean graphs evolved under selection for\nshort dynamical attractors. We define the adjacency matrix of a graph as its\ngenotype, which gets mutated in the course of evolution, while its phenotype is\nits set of dynamical attractors. Metanetworks in the genotype and phenotype\nspaces are formed, respectively, by genetic proximity and by phenotypic\nsimilarity, the latter weighted by the sizes of the basins of attraction of the\nshared attractors. We find that populations of evolved networks form giant\nclusters in genotype space, have Poissonian degree distributions but exhibit\nhierarchically organized $\\kappa$-core decompositions. Nevertheless, at large\nscales, they form tree-like expander graphs. Random populations of Boolean\ngraphs are typically so far removed from each other genetically that they\ncannot form a metanetwork. In phenotype space, the metanetworks of evolved\npopulations are super robust both under the elimination of weak connections and\nrandom removal of nodes.\n", "  The semi-classical approach leading to the Thomas-Fermi (TF) model provides a\nsimple universal thermodynamic description of the electronic cloud surrounding\nthe nucleus in an atom. This model is known to be exact at the limit of\n$Z\\rightarrow\\infty$, i.e., infinite nuclear charge, at finite density and\ntemperature. Motivated by the zero-temperature case, we show in the current\nletter that the correction to TF due to quantum treatment of the strongly bound\ninner-most electrons, for which the semi-classical approximation breaks, scales\nas $Z^{-1/3}$, with respect to the TF solution. As such, it is more dominant\nthan the quantum corrections to the kinetic energy, as well as exchange and\ncorrelation, which are known to be suppressed by $Z^{-2/3}$. We conjecture that\nthis is the leading correction for this model. In addition, we present a\ndifferent free energy functional for the TF model, and a successive functional\nthat includes the strongly bound electrons correction. We use this corrected\nfunctional to derive a self-consistent potential and the electron density in\nthe atom, and to calculate the corrected energy. At this stage, our model has a\nbuilt-in validity limit, breaking as the L shell ionizes.\n", "  We study the effect of the non-commutativity on the creation of scalar\nparticles from vacuum in the anisotropic universe space-time. We derive the\ndeformed Klein-Gordon equation up to second order in the non-commutativity\nparameter using the general modified field equation. Then the canonical method\nbased on Bogoliubov transformation is applied to calculate the probability of\nparticle creation in vacuum and the corresponding number density in the $k$\nmode. We deduce that the non-commutative space-time introduces a new source of\nparticle creation.\n", "  It has recently been proposed that gamma-ray burst (GRB) events may be\nmodified by the presence of a dark matter sector subcomponent that is charged\nunder an unbroken U(1). This proposal depends upon there being a non-trivial\ndensity of charged dark matter in star forming regions of galaxies which host\nGRBs. We discuss four Wolf-Rayet galaxies (NGC 1614, NGC 3367, NGC 4216 and NGC\n5430) which should contain comparable amounts of dark matter gas and visible\nmatter gas in the star forming regions. We show that the ratio of dark jet\npower to visible jet power depends only on the ratio of particle mass and\ncharge when the densities are equal, allowing for these input parameters to be\nprobed directly by future observations of GRBs.\n", "  The vector type of interaction of the Thirring-Wess model was replaced by the\nchiral type and a new model was presented which was termed as chiral\nThirring-Wess model in \\cite{THAR}. The model was studied there with a\nFaddeevian class of regularization. Few ambiguity parameters were allowed there\nwith the apprehension that unitarity might be threatened like the chiral\ngeneration of the Schwinger model. In the present work it has been shown that\nno counter term containing the regularization ambiguity is needed for this\nmodel to be physically sensible. So the chiral Thirring-Wess model is studied\nhere without the presence of any ambiguity parameter and it has been found that\nthe model not only remains exactly solvable but also does not lose the\nunitarity like the chiral generation of the Schwinger model. The phase space\nstructure and the theoretical spectrum of this new model have been determined\nin the present scenario. The theoretical spectrum is found to contain a massive\nboson with ambiguity free mass and a massless boson.\n", "  We develop a variational method of deriving stochastic partial differential\nequations whose solutions follow the flow of a stochastic vector field. As an\nexample in one spatial dimension we numerically simulate singular solutions\n(peakons) of the stochastically perturbed Camassa-Holm (CH) equation derived\nusing this method. These numerical simulations show that peakon soliton\nsolutions of the stochastically perturbed CH equation persist and provide an\ninteresting laboratory for investigating the sensitivity and accuracy of adding\nstochasticity to finite dimensional solutions of stochastic partial\ndifferential equations (SPDE). In particular, some choices of stochastic\nperturbations of the peakon dynamics by Wiener noise (canonical Hamiltonian\nstochastic deformations, or CH-SD) allow peakons to interpenetrate and exchange\norder on the real line in overtaking collisions, although this behaviour does\nnot occur for other choices of stochastic perturbations which preserve the\nEuler-Poincar\\'e structure of the CH equation (parametric stochastic\ndeformations, or P-SD), and it also does not occur for peakon solutions of the\nunperturbed deterministic CH equation. The discussion raises issues about the\nscience of stochastic deformations of finite-dimensional approximations of\nevolutionary PDE and the sensitivity of the resulting solutions to the choices\nmade in stochastic modelling.\n", "  We study the production of a Higgs boson recoiling from a massless invisible\nsystem in $e^ + e^ -$ collisions. This is a quite distinctive signature that\ncan arise when the Higgs boson is produced in association with a massless dark\nphoton, which can happen in BSM scenarios foreseeing an extra unbroken $U(1)$\ngauge group. Dark photons can indeed acquire effective couplings to the Higgs\nboson as occurs in models recently proposed to generate exponentially-spread\nYukawa couplings. We analyze the signal and corresponding backgrounds for $H\\to\nb\\bar{b}$, and estimate ILC and FCC-ee sensitivities in a model-independent\nway.\n", "  We investigate the local density of states, spectral function, and\nsuperconducting pair amplitudes for signatures of Majorana fermions in vortex\ncores in ferromagnetic and spin-orbit coupled semiconductor-superconductor\nheterostructures. We show that the Majorana fermion quasiparticle momentum\ndistribution is always symmetrically distributed at a finite radius around a\nhigh symmetry point, thereby providing a necessary condition for a low-energy\nstate to be a Majorana fermion. In real space profiles of the local density of\nstates through the vortex core the Majorana fermion, together with other\nfinite-energy vortex states, form a characteristic x-shape structure only\npresent at non-trivial topology. Moreover, we find that the Mexican hat band\nstructure property of the topologically non-trivial phase translates into\nmultiple high-intensity band edges and also vortex core states located above\nthe superconducting gap in the local density of states. Finally, we find no\nstrong correlation between odd-frequency pairing and the appearance of Majorana\nfermions, but odd-frequency pairing exists as soon as ferromagnetism is\npresent. In fact, we find that the only vortex superconducting pair amplitude\ndirectly related to any phase transition, is the appearance of certain\nspin-triplet $p$-wave pairing components in the vortex core at a\npre-topological vortex core widening transition.\n", "  We review recent developments concerning non-equilibrium quantum dynamics and\nmany-body physics with light, in superconducting circuits and Josephson\nanalogues. We start with quantum impurity models summarizing the effect of\ndissipation and of driving the system. We mention theoretical and experimental\nefforts to characterize these non-equilibrium quantum systems. We show how\nJosephson junction systems can implement the equivalent of the Kondo effect\nwith microwave photons. The Kondo effect is characterized by a renormalized\nlight-frequency and a peak in the Rayleigh elastic transmission of a photon. We\nalso address the physics of hybrid systems comprising mesoscopic quantum dot\ndevices coupled to an electromagnetic resonator. Then, we discuss extensions to\nQuantum Electrodynamics (QED) Networks allowing to engineer the Jaynes-Cummings\nlattice and Rabi lattice models. This opens the door to novel many-body physics\nwith light out of equilibrium, in relation with the Mott-superfluid transition\nobserved with ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices. Then, we summarize recent\ntheoretical predictions for realizing topological phases with light. Synthetic\ngauge fields and spin-orbit couplings have been successfully implemented with\nultra-cold atoms in optical lattices --- using time-dependent Floquet\nperturbations periodic in time, for example --- as well as in photonic lattice\nsystems. Finally, we discuss the Josephson effect related to Bose-Hubbard\nmodels in ladder and two-dimensional geometries. The Bose-Hubbard model is\nrelated to the Jaynes-Cummings lattice model in the large detuning limit\nbetween light and matter. In the presence of synthetic gauge fields, we show\nthat Meissner currents subsist in an insulating Mott phase.\n", "  We calculate the $k$-point generating function of the correlated Jacobi\nensemble using supersymmetric methods. We use the result for complex matrices\nfor $k=1$ to derive a closed-form expression for eigenvalue density. For real\nmatrices we obtain the density in terms of a twofold integral that we evaluate\nnumerically. For both expressions we find agreement when comparing with Monte\nCarlo simulations. Relations between these quantities for the Jacobi and the\nCauchy-Lorentz ensemble are derived.\n", "  Compressed mass spectra are generally more difficult to identify than spectra\nwith large splittings. In particular, gluino pair production with four high\nenergy top or bottom quarks leaves a striking signature in a detector. However,\nif any of the mass splittings are compressed, the power of traditional\ntechniques may deteriorate. Searches for direct stop/sbottom pair production\ncan fill in the gaps. As a demonstration, we show that for\n$\\tilde{g}\\rightarrow t\\tilde{t}_1$ and $m_{\\tilde{t}_1}\\sim\nm_{\\tilde{\\chi}_1^0}$, limits on the stop mass at 8 TeV can be extended by\nleast 300 GeV for a 1.1 TeV gluino using a $pp\\rightarrow\n\\tilde{t}_1\\tilde{t}_1$ search. At 13 TeV, the effective cross section for the\ngluino mediated process is twice the direct stop/sbottom pair production cross\nsection, suggesting that direct stop/sbottom searches could be sensitive to\ndiscover new physics earlier than expected.\n", "  Composite Higgs models generically predict the existence of heavy spin-1\nresonances with the same quantum numbers as electroweak gauge bosons. The\neffective lagrangian description of these resonances is presented, pointing out\nthe origin of their interactions with SM matter fields and the resulting LHC\nphenomenology. Search strategies for spin-1 resonances are discussed,\nmentioning possible advantages offered by boosted decay products. The impact of\ninteractions between spin-1 resonances and fermion resonances, crucial for the\nproper interpretation of LHC searches, is pointed out.\n", "  We analyze the behavior of electromagnetic fields inside a resonant cavity by\nsolving Einstein--Maxwell field equations. It is shown that the modified\ngeometry of space-time inside the cavity due to a propagating mode can affect\nthe propagation of a laser beam. It is seen that components of laser light with\na shifted frequency appear originating from the coupling between the laser\nfield and the mode cavity due to gravity. The analysis is extended to the case\nof an asymmetric resonant cavity taken to be a truncated cone. It is shown that\na proper choice of the geometrical parameters of the cavity and dielectric can\nmake the gravitational effects significant for an interferometric setup. This\ncould make possible to realize table-top experiments involving gravitational\neffects.\n", "  Cold dark matter (DM) scenario may be cured of several problems by involving\nself-interaction of dark matter. Viability of the models of long-range\ninteracting DM crucially depends on the effectiveness of recombination of the\nDM particles, making thereby their interaction short-range. Usually in numeric\ncalculations, recombination is described by cross section obtained on a\nfeasible quantum level. However in a wide range of parameter values, a\nclassical treatment, where the particles are bound due to dipole radiation, is\napplicable. The cross sections, obtained in both approaches, are very different\nand lead to diverse consequences. Classical cross section has a steeper\ndependence on relative velocity, what leads to the fact that, after decoupling\nof DM particles from thermal background of \"dark photons\" (carriers of DM\nlong-range interaction), recombination process does not \"freeze out\",\ndiminishing gradually density of unbound DM particles. Our simplified estimates\nshow, that at the taken parameter values (the mass of DM particle is $100$ GeV,\ninteraction constant is $100^{-1}$, and quite natural assumptions on initial\nconditions, from which the result is very weakly dependent) the difference in\nresidual density reaches about $5$ orders of magnitude on pre-galactic stage.\nThis estimate takes into account thermal effects induced by dipole radiation\nand recombination, which resulted in the increase of both temperature and\ndensity of DM particles by a half order of magnitude.\n", "  A general quantum network for implementing non-local control-unitary gates,\nbetween remote parties at minimal entanglement cost, is shown to be a\nrooted-tree structure. Starting from a five party scenario, we demonstrate the\nlocal implementation of simultaneous control-Hermitian and multiparty\ncontrol-unitary gates in an arbitrary n-party network. Previously established\nnetworks are shown to be special cases of this general construct.\n", "  Most continuous-variable quantum key distribution schemes are based on the\nGaussian modulation of coherent states followed by continuous quadrature\ndetection using homodyne detectors. In all previous schemes, the Gaussian\nmodulation has been carried out in conjugate quadratures thus requiring two\nindependent modulators for their implementations. Here, we propose and\nexperimentally test a largely simplified scheme in which the Gaussian\nmodulation is performed in a single quadrature. The scheme is shown to be\nasymptotically secure against collective attacks, and considers asymmetric\npreparation and excess noise. A single-quadrature modulation approach renders\nthe need for a costly amplitude modulator unnecessary, and thus facilitates\ncommercialization of continuous-variable quantum key distribution.\n", "  We compute asymptotics for Hankel determinants and orthogonal polynomials\nwith respect to a discontinuous Gaussian weight, in a critical regime where the\ndiscontinuity is close to the edge of the associated equilibrium measure\nsupport. Their behavior is described in terms of the Ablowitz-Segur family of\nsolutions to the Painlev\\'e II equation. Our results complement the ones in\n[Xu,Zhao,2011]. As consequences of our results, we conjecture asymptotics for\nan Airy kernel Fredholm determinant and total integral identities for\nPainlev\\'e II transcendents, and we also prove a new result on the poles of the\nAblowitz-Segur solutions to the Painlev\\'e II equation. We also highlight\napplications of our results in random matrix theory.\n", "  We present a bouquet of continuity bounds for quantum entropies, falling\nbroadly into two classes: First, a tight analysis of the Alicki-Fannes\ncontinuity bounds for the conditional von Neumann entropy, reaching almost the\nbest possible form that depends only on the system dimension and the trace\ndistance of the states. Almost the same proof can be used to derive similar\ncontinuity bounds for the relative entropy distance from a convex set of states\nor positive operators. As applications we give new proofs, with tighter bounds,\nof the asymptotic continuity of the relative entropy of entanglement, $E_R$,\nand its regularization $E_R^\\infty$, as well as of the entanglement of\nformation, $E_F$. Using a novel \"quantum coupling\" of density operators, which\nmay be of independent interest, we extend the latter to an asymptotic\ncontinuity bound for the regularized entanglement of formation, aka\nentanglement cost, $E_C=E_F^\\infty$.\n  Second, analogous continuity bounds for the von Neumann entropy and\nconditional entropy in infinite dimensional systems under an energy constraint,\nmost importantly systems of multiple quantum harmonic oscillators. While\nwithout an energy bound the entropy is discontinuous, it is well-known to be\ncontinuous on states of bounded energy. However, a quantitative statement to\nthat effect seems not to have been known. Here, under some regularity\nassumptions on the Hamiltonian, we find that, quite intuitively, the Gibbs\nentropy at the given energy roughly takes the role of the Hilbert space\ndimension in the finite-dimensional Fannes inequality.\n", "  We describe a connection between entanglement and designs. It involves the\nconical 2-designs introduced in a previous paper. These are a generalization of\nprojective 2-designs which includes full sets of arbitrary rank mutually\nunbiased measurements (MUMs) and arbitrary rank symmetric informationally\ncomplete measurements (SIMs), as well as the more familiar MUBs and SICs. We\nshow that a POVM is a conical 2-design if and only if there exists what we call\na regular entanglement monotone whose restriction to the pure states is a\nfunction of the norm of the probability vector. In that case the concurrence is\nsuch a monotone. We also generalize and develop previous work on designs and\nentanglement detection.\n", "  We develop an analytic perturbation theory for eigenvalues with finite\nmultiplicities, embedded into the essential spectrum of a self-adjoint operator\n$H$. We assume the existence of another self-adjoint operator $A$ for which the\nfamily $H_\\theta = e^{\\mathrm{i}\\theta A} H e^{-\\mathrm{i}\\theta A}$ extends\nanalytically from the real line to a strip in the complex plane. Assuming a\nMourre estimate holds for $\\mathrm{i}[H,A]$ in the vicinity of the eigenvalue,\nwe prove that the essential spectrum is locally deformed away from the\neigenvalue, leaving it isolated and thus permitting an application of Kato's\nanalytic perturbation theory.\n", "  Collimated streams of particles produced in high energy physics experiments\nare organized using clustering algorithms to form jets. To construct jets, the\nexperimental collaborations based at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) primarily\nuse agglomerative hierarchical clustering schemes known as sequential\nrecombination. We propose a new class of algorithms for clustering jets that\nuse infrared and collinear safe mixture models. These new algorithms, known as\nfuzzy jets, are clustered using maximum likelihood techniques and can\ndynamically determine various properties of jets like their size. We show that\nthe fuzzy jet size adds additional information to conventional jet tagging\nvariables. Furthermore, we study the impact of pileup and show that with some\nslight modifications to the algorithm, fuzzy jets can be stable up to high\npileup interaction multiplicities.\n", "  The decay rate of the Higgs decay $H \\to Z \\gamma$ is evaluated at the\none-loop level in the $SO(5)\\times U(1)$ gauge-Higgs unification. Although an\ninfinite number of loops with Kaluza-Klein states contribute to the decay\namplitude, there appears the cancellation among the loops, and the decay rate\nis found to be finite and non-zero. It is found that the decay rate is well\napproximated by the decay rate in the standard model multiplied by\n$\\cos^2\\theta_H$, where $\\theta_H$ is the Aharonov-Bohm phase induced by the\nvacuum expectation value of an extra-dimensional component of the gauge field.\n", "  We study long-time dynamics of a bosonic system after suddenly switching on\nrepulsive delta-like interactions. As initial states, we consider two\nexperimentally relevant configurations: a rotating BEC and two\ncounter-propagating BECs with opposite momentum, both on a ring. In the first\ncase, the rapidity distribution function for the stationary state is derived\nanalytically and it is given by the distribution obtained for the same quench\nstarting from a BEC, shifted by the momentum of each boson. In the second case,\nthe rapidity distribution function is obtained numerically for generic values\nof repulsive interaction and initial momentum. The significant differences for\nthe case of large versus small quenches are discussed.\n", "  The magnetic anisotropy energy defines the energy barrier that stabilizes a\nmagnetic moment. Utilizing density functional theory based simulations and\nanalytical formulations, we establish that this barrier is strongly modified by\nlong-range contributions very similar to Frieden oscillations and\nRudermann-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions. Thus, oscillations are expected\nand observed, with different decaying factors and highly anisotropic in\nrealistic materials, which can switch non-trivially the sign of the magnetic\nanisotropy energy. This behavior is general and for illustration we address\ntransition metals adatoms, Cr, Mn, Fe and Co deposited on Pt(111) surface. We\nexplain in particular the mechanisms leading to the strong site-dependence of\nthe magnetic anisotropy energy observed for Fe adatoms on Pt(111) surface as\nrevealed previously via first-principles based simulations and inelastic\nscanning tunneling spectroscopy (A. A. Khajetoorians et al. Phys. Rev. Lett.\n111, 157204 (2013)). The same mechanisms are probably active for the\nsite-dependence of the magnetic anisotropy energy obtained for Fe adatoms on Pd\nor Rh(111) surfaces and for Co adatoms on Rh(111) surface (P. Blonski et al.\nPhys. Rev. B 81, 104426 (2010)).\n", "  In this work, the spectrum of ground state and excited baryons (N, {\\Delta},\n, , and {\\Omega} particles) has been investigated by using a non-relativistic\nquantum mechanics under the Killingbeck plus isotonic oscillator potentials.\nUsing the Jacobi-coordinates, anzast method and generalized G\\\"ursey Radicati\n(GR) mass formula the three body wave equation is solved to calculate the\ndifferent states of the considered baryons. A comparison between our\ncalculations and the available experimental data shows that the position of the\nRoper resonances of the nucleon, the ground states and the excited multiplets\nup to three GeV are in general well reproduced. Also one can conclude that; the\ninteraction between the quark constituents of baryon resonances could be\ndescribed adequately by using the combination of Killingbeck and isotonic\noscillator potentials form.\n", "  As one of the simplest systems for realizing Majorana fermions, topological\nsuperconductor plays an important role in both condensed matter physics and\nquantum computations. Based on \\emph{ab~initio} calculations and the analysis\nof an effective 8-band model with the superconducting pairing, we demonstrate\nthat the three dimensional extended $s$-wave Fe-based superconductors such as\nFe$_{1+\\text{y}}$Se$_{0.5}$Te$_{0.5}$ have a metallic topologically nontrivial\nband structure, and exhibit a normal-topological-normal superconductivity phase\ntransition on the ($001$) surface by tuning the bulk carrier doping level. In\nthe topological superconductivity (TSC) phase, a Majorana zero mode is trapped\nat the end of a magnetic vortex line. We further show that, the surface TSC\nphase only exists up to a certain bulk pairing gap, and there is a\nnormal-topological phase transition driven by the temperature, which has not\nbeen discussed before. These results pave an effective way to realize the TSC\nand Majorana fermions in a large class of superconductors.\n", "  The design and fabrication of phononic crystals (PnCs) hold the key to\ncontrol the propagation of heat and sound at the nanoscale. However, there is a\nlack of experimental studies addressing the impact of order/disorder on the\nphononic properties of PnCs. Here, we present a comparative investigation of\nthe influence of disorder on the hypersonic and thermal properties of\ntwo-dimensional PnCs. PnCs of ordered and disordered lattices are fabricated of\ncircular holes with equal filling fractions in free-standing Si membranes.\nUltrafast pump and probe spectroscopy (asynchronous optical sampling) and Raman\nthermometry based on a novel two-laser approach are used to study the phononic\nproperties in the gigahertz (GHz) and terahertz (THz) regime, respectively.\nFinite element method simulations of the phonon dispersion relation and\nthree-dimensional displacement fields furthermore enable the unique\nidentification of the different hypersonic vibrations. The increase of surface\nroughness and the introduction of short-range disorder are shown to modify the\nphonon dispersion and phonon coherence in the hypersonic (GHz) range without\naffecting the room-temperature thermal conductivity. On the basis of these\nfindings, we suggest a criteria for predicting phonon coherence as a function\nof roughness and disorder.\n", "  We show that the masses of red giant stars can be well predicted from their\nphotospheric carbon and nitrogen abundances, in conjunction with their\nspectroscopic stellar labels log g, Teff, and [Fe/H]. This is qualitatively\nexpected from mass-dependent post main sequence evolution. We here establish an\nempirical relation between these quantities by drawing on 1,475 red giants with\nasteroseismic mass estimates from Kepler that also have spectroscopic labels\nfrom APOGEE DR12. We assess the accuracy of our model, and find that it\npredicts stellar masses with fractional r.m.s. errors of about 14% (typically\n0.2 Msun). From these masses, we derive ages with r.m.s errors of 40%. This\nempirical model allows us for the first time to make age determinations (in the\nrange 1-13 Gyr) for vast numbers of giant stars across the Galaxy. We apply our\nmodel to 52,000 stars in APOGEE DR12, for which no direct mass and age\ninformation was previously available. We find that these estimates highlight\nthe vertical age structure of the Milky Way disk, and that the relation of age\nwith [alpha/M] and metallicity is broadly consistent with established\nexpectations based on detailed studies of the solar neighbourhood.\n", "  We report a nonsaturating linear magnetoresistance in charge-compensated\nbilayer graphene in a temperature range from 1.5 to 150 K. The observed linear\nmagnetoresistance disappears away from charge neutrality ruling out the\ntraditional explanation of the effect in terms of the classical random resistor\nnetwork model. We show that experimental results qualitatively agree with a\nphenomenological two-fluid model taking into account electron-hole\nrecombination and finite-size sample geometry.\n", "  We examine the effects of $f(R)$ gravity on Jeans analysis of collapsing dust\nclouds. We provide a method for testing modified gravity models by their\neffects on star formation as the presence of $f(R)$ gravity is found to modify\nthe limit for collapse. In this analysis we add perturbations to a de Sitter\nbackground. Depending on the characteristics of a chosen $f(R)$ model, the\nappearance of new limits is possible. The physicality of these limits is\nfurther examined. We find the asymptotic Jeans masses for $f(R)$ theories\ncompared to standard Jeans mass. Through this ratio, the effects of the $f(R)$\nmodified Jeans mass for viable theories are examined in molecular clouds. Bok\nglobules have a mass range comparable to Jeans masses in question and are\ntherefore used for comparing different $f(R)$ models. Viable theories are found\nto assist in star formation.\n", "  I propose the first multiscalar singlet extension of the Standard Model (SM),\nthat generates tree level top quark and exotic fermion masses as well as one\nand three loop level masses for charged fermions lighter than the top quark and\nfor light active neutrinos, respectively, without invoking electrically charged\nscalar fields. That model, which is based on the $S_{3}\\times Z_{8}$ discrete\nsymmetry, successfully explains the observed SM fermion mass and mixing\npattern. The charged exotic fermions induce one loop level masses for charged\nfermions lighter than the top quark. The $Z_{8}$ charged scalar singlet $\\chi$\ngenerates the observed charged fermion mass and quark mixing pattern.\n", "  Gravitational lens flux-ratio anomalies provide a powerful technique for\nmeasuring dark matter substructure in distant galaxies. However, before using\nthese flux-ratio anomalies to test galaxy formation models, it is imperative to\nascertain that the given anomalies are indeed due to the presence of dark\nmatter substructure and not due to some other component of the lensing galaxy\nhalo or to propagation effects. Here we present the case of CLASS~B1555+375,\nwhich has a strong radio-wavelength flux-ratio anomaly. Our high-resolution\nnear-infrared Keck~II adaptive optics imaging and archival Hubble Space\nTelescope data reveal the lensing galaxy in this system to have a clear edge-on\ndisc component that crosses directly over the pair of images that exhibit the\nflux-ratio anomaly. We find that simple models that include the disc can\nreproduce the cm-wavelength flux-ratio anomaly without requiring additional\ndark matter substructure. Although further studies are required, our results\nsuggest the assumption that all flux-ratio anomalies are due to a population of\ndark matter sub-haloes may be incorrect, and analyses that do not account for\nthe full complexity of the lens macro-model may overestimate the substructure\nmass fraction in massive lensing galaxies.\n", "  A measurement of the $B^0_s$ decay parameters in the $B^0_s \\to J/\\psi\\phi$\nchannel using an integrated luminosity of 14.3 $\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ collected by\nthe ATLAS detector from 8 TeV $pp$ collisions at the LHC is presented. The\nmeasured parameters include the $CP$-violating phase $\\phi_s$, the decay width\n$\\Gamma_s$ and the width difference between the mass eigenstates\n$\\Delta\\Gamma_s$. The values measured for the physical parameters are\nstatistically combined with those from 4.9 $\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of 7 TeV data,\nleading to the following: \\begin{eqnarray*} \\phi_s & = & -0.090 \\pm\n0.078\\;\\mathrm{(stat.)} \\pm 0.041\\;\\mathrm{(syst.)\\;rad} \\\\ \\Delta\\Gamma_s & =\n& 0.085 \\pm 0.011\\;\\mathrm{(stat.)} \\pm 0.007\\;\\mathrm{(syst.)\\;ps}^{-1} \\\\\n\\Gamma_s & = & 0.675 \\pm 0.003\\;\\mathrm{(stat.)} \\pm\n0.003\\;\\mathrm{(syst.)\\;ps}^{-1}. \\end{eqnarray*} In the analysis the parameter\n$\\Delta\\Gamma_s$ is constrained to be positive. Results for $\\phi_s$ and\n$\\Delta\\Gamma_s$ are also presented as 68% and 95% likelihood contours in the\n$\\phi_s-\\Delta\\Gamma_s$ plane. Also measured in this decay channel are the\ntransversity amplitudes and corresponding strong phases. All measurements are\nin agreement with the Standard Model predictions.\n", "  This paper represents a contribution to the study of the brain functional\nconnectivity from the perspective of complex networks theory. More\nspecifically, we apply graph theoretical analyses to provide evidence of the\nmodular structure of the mouse brain and to shed light on its hierarchical\norganization. We propose a novel percolation analysis and we apply our approach\nto the analysis of a resting-state functional MRI data set from 41 mice. This\napproach reveals a robust hierarchical structure of modules persistent across\ndifferent subjects. Importantly, we test this approach against a statistical\nbenchmark (or null model) which constrains only the distributions of empirical\ncorrelations. Our results unambiguously show that the hierarchical character of\nthe mouse brain modular structure is not trivially encoded into this\nlower-order constraint. Finally, we investigate the modular structure of the\nmouse brain by computing the Minimal Spanning Forest, a technique that\nidentifies subnetworks characterized by the strongest internal correlations.\nThis approach represents a faster alternative to other community detection\nmethods and provides a means to rank modules on the basis of the strength of\ntheir internal edges.\n", "  We present a doubly parametric extension of the standard Froggatt--Nielsen\n(FN) mechanism. As is well known, mass matrices of the up- and down-type quark\nsectors and the charged lepton sector in the standard model can be parametrized\nwell by a parameter $\\lambda$ which is usually taken to be the sine of the\nCabibbo angle ($\\lambda = \\sin\\theta_\\text{C} \\simeq 0.225$). However, in the\nneutrino sector, there is still room to realize the two neutrino mass squared\ndifferences $\\Delta m_\\text{sol}^2$ and $\\Delta m_\\text{atm}^2$, two large\nmixing angles $\\theta _{12}$ and $\\theta _{23}$, and non-zero $\\theta _{13}$.\nThen we consider an extension with an additional parameter $\\rho$ in addition\nto $\\lambda$. Taking the relevant FN charges for a power of $\\lambda~(=0.225)$\nand additional FN charges for a power of $\\rho$, which we assume to be less\nthan one, we can reproduce the ratio of the two neutrino mass squared\ndifferences and three mixing angles. In the normal neutrino mass hierarchy, we\nshow several patterns for taking relevant FN charges and the magnitude of\n$\\rho$. We find that if $\\sin \\theta_{23}$ is measured more precisely, we can\ndistinguish each pattern. This is testable in the near future, for example in\nneutrino oscillation experiments. In addition, we predict the Dirac\nCP-violating phase for each pattern.\n", "  We discuss recent theoretical progress in heavy-quark hadro-production, in\nparticular focusing on processes involving charm-quarks, and on their\nimplications in different fields of particle phenomenology, from collider to\nastroparticle physics.\n", "  We investigate the dependence of friction forces on normal load in\nincommensurate micrometer size contacts between atomically smooth\nsingle-crystal graphite surfaces under ambient conditions. Our experimental\nresults show that these contacts exhibit superlubricity (super-low friction),\nwhich is robust against the application of normal load. The measured friction\ncoefficients are essentially zero and independent of the external normal load\nup to a pressure of 1.67 MPa. The observation of load-independent\nsuperlubricity in micro-scale contacts is a promising result for numerous\npractical applications.\n", "  We discuss various properties of rotating Killing horizons in generic $F(R)$\ntheories of gravity in dimension four for spacetimes endowed with two commuting\nKilling vector fields. Assuming there is no curvature singularity anywhere on\nor outside the horizon, we construct a suitable $(3+1)$-foliation. We show that\nsimilar to Einstein's gravity, we must have $T_{ab}k^ak^b=0$ on the Killing\nhorizon, where $k^a$ is a null geodesic tangent to the horizon. For\naxisymmetric spacetimes, the effective gravitational coupling\n$\\sim\\,F'^{-1}(R)$ should usually depend upon the polar coordinate and hence\nneed not necessarily be a constant on the Killing horizon. We prove that the\nsurface gravity of such a Killing horizon must be a constant, irrespective of\nwhether $F'(R)$ is a constant there or not. We next apply these results to\ninvestigate some further basic features. In particular, we show that any hairy\nsolution for the real massive vector field in such theories is clearly ruled\nout, as long as the potential of the scalar field generated in the\ncorresponding Einstein's frame is a positive definite quantity.\n", "  Using Hirota's direct method and Baecklund transformations we construct\nexplicit complex one and two-solutions to the complex Korteweg-de Vries\nequation, the complex modified Korteweg-de Vries equation and the complex\nsine-Gordon equation. The one-soliton solutions of trigonometric and elliptic\ntype turn out to be PT-symmetric when a constant of integration is chosen to be\npurely imaginary with one special choice corresponding to solutions recently\nfound by Khare and Saxena. We show that alternatively complex PT-symmetric\nsolutions to the Korteweg-de Vries equation may also be constructed\nalternatively from real solutions to the modified Korteweg-de Vries by means of\nMiura transformations. The multi-soliton solutions obtained from Hirota's\nmethod break the PT-symmetric, whereas those obtained from Baecklund\ntransformations are PT-invariant under certain conditions. Despite the fact\nthat some of the Hamiltonian densities are non-Hermitian, the total energy is\nfound to be positive in all cases, that is irrespective of whether they are\nPT-symmetric or not. The reason is that the symmetry can be restored by\nsuitable shifts in space-time and the fact that any of our N-soliton solutions\nmay be decomposed into N separate PT-symmetrizable one-soliton solutions.\n", "  We analyse the statistics of the shear stress in a one dimensional\n\\emph{model fluid}, that exhibits a rich phase behaviour akin to real complex\nfluids under shear. We show that the energy flux satisfies the Gallavotti-Cohen\nFT across all phases in the system. The theorem allows us to define an\neffective temperature which deviates considerably from the equilibrium\ntemperature as the noise in the system increases. This deviation is negligible\nwhen the system size is small. The dependence of the effective temperature on\nthe strain rate is phase-dependent. It doesn't vary much at the phase\nboundaries. The effective temperature can also be determined from the large\ndeviation function of the energy flux. The local strain rate statistics obeys\nthe large deviation principle and satisfies a fluctuation relation. It does not\nexhibit a distinct kink near zero strain rate because of inertia of the rotors\nin our system.\n", "  Single phase polycrystalline sample of perovskite Sr2TiMnO6 (STMO) has been\nsuccessfully synthesized via solid state reaction route. Its detailed\nstructural and physical properties have been studied using x-ray diffraction,\ntransmission electron microscopy, magnetization, specific heat, and dielectric\nmeasurements. Rietveld analysis of the powder XRD data and transmission\nelectron microscopy studies confirm that STMO is not a double perovskite\nstructure with Fm-3m space group. But it is a disordered perovskite structure\nwith Pm-3m space group where Ti4+ and Mn4+ ions are randomly distributed at the\n1b site. The dc magnetization (\\c{hi}dc-vs-T) measurements in the temperature\nrange 2-300K reveals a single anomaly at ~13K with predominant long range\ncanted antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering. The frequency invariant maxima at 13K\nin the ac susceptibility (\\c{hi}ac-vs-T) discards the spin-glass behaviour in\nSTMO. Despite the presence of sharp feature in M-T data, the specific heat data\n(Cp-vs-T) shows only a broad hump around 13K, which has been attributed to the\nmagneto-structural ordering giving rise to canted AFM state in chemically\ndisorder STMO. Matching with the magnetic and specific heat anomaly, the\ndielectric permittivity also shows a broad anomaly around 14K, indicating the\npossible magneto-dielectric coupling in STMO.\n", "  The optimization of resistive anode for two dimensional imaging detectors\nwhich consists of a series of high resistive square pads surrounding by low\nresistive strips has been studied by both numerical simulations and\nexperimental tests. It has been found that to obtain good detector performance,\nthe resistance ratio of the pad to the strip should be larger than 5, the\nnonuniformity of the pad surface resistivity had better be less than $20\\%$, a\nsmaller pad width leads to a smaller spatial resolution and when the pad width\nis $6mm$, the spatial resolution ($\\sigma$) can reach about $105{\\mu}m$. Based\non the study results, a 2-D GEM detector prototype with the optimized resistive\nanode is constructed and a good imaging performance is achieved.\n", "  Covariant perturbation expansion is an important method in quantum field\ntheory. In this paper an expansion up to arbitrary order for off-diagonal heat\nkernels in flat space based on the covariant perturbation expansion is given.\nIn literature, only diagonal heat kernels are calculated based on the covariant\nperturbation expansion.\n", "  We report the discovery of 15 quasars and bright galaxies at 5.7 < z < 6.9.\nThis is the initial result from the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity\nQuasars (SHELLQs) project, which exploits the exquisite multiband imaging data\nproduced by the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Strategic Program survey. The\ncandidate selection is performed by combining several photometric approaches\nincluding a Bayesian probabilistic algorithm to reject stars and dwarfs. The\nspectroscopic identification was carried out with the Gran Telescopio Canarias\nand the Subaru Telescope for the first 80 deg2 of the survey footprint. The\nsuccess rate of our photometric selection is quite high, approaching 100 % at\nthe brighter magnitudes (zAB < 23.5 mag). Our selection also recovered all the\nknown high-z quasars on the HSC images. Among the 15 discovered objects, six\nare likely quasars, while the other six with interstellar absorption lines and\nin some cases narrow emission lines are likely bright Lyman-break galaxies. The\nremaining three objects have weak continua and very strong and narrow Ly alpha\nlines, which may be excited by ultraviolet light from both young stars and\nquasars. These results indicate that we are starting to see the steep rise of\nthe luminosity function of z > 6 galaxies, compared with that of quasars, at\nmagnitudes fainter than M1450 ~ -22 mag or zAB ~24 mag. Follow-up studies of\nthe discovered objects as well as further survey observations are ongoing.\n", "  Topological phases of matter are usually realized in deconfined phases of\ngauge theories. In this context, confined phases with strongly fluctuating\ngauge fields seem to be irrelevant to the physics of topological phases. For\nexample, the low-energy theory of the two-dimensional (2D) toric code model\n(i.e. the deconfined phase of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory) is a $U(1)\\times\nU(1)$ Chern-Simons theory in which gauge charges (i.e., $e$ and $m$ particles)\nare deconfined and the gauge fields are gapped, while the confined phase is\ntopologically trivial. In this paper, we point out a new route to constructing\nexotic 3D gapped fermionic phases in a confining phase of a gauge theory.\nStarting from a parton construction with strongly fluctuating compact\n$U(1)\\times U(1)$ gauge fields, we construct gapped phases of interacting\nfermions by condensing two linearly independent bosonic composite particles\nconsisting of partons and $U(1)\\times U(1)$ magnetic monopoles. This can be\nregarded as a 3D generalization of the 2D Bais-Slingerland condensation\nmechanism. Charge fractionalization results from a Debye-H\\\"uckel-like\nscreening cloud formed by the condensed composite particles. Within our general\nframework, we explore two aspects of symmetry-enriched 3D Abelian topological\nphases. First, we construct a new fermionic state of matter with time-reversal\nsymmetry and $\\Theta\\neq \\pi$, the fractional topological insulator. Second, we\ngeneralize the notion of anyonic symmetry of 2D Abelian topological phases to\nthe charge-loop excitation symmetry ($\\mathsf{Charles}$) of 3D Abelian\ntopological phases. We show that line twist defects, which realize\n$\\mathsf{Charles}$ transformations, exhibit non-Abelian fusion properties.\n", "  Two major problems, still associated with the SN1987A, are: a) the signals\nobserved with the gravitational waves detectors, b) the duration of the\ncollapse. Indeed, a) the sensitivity of the gravitational wave detectors seems\nto be small for detecting gravitational waves and, b) while some experimental\ndata indicate a duration of order of hours, most theories assume that the\ncollapse develops in a few seconds. Since recent data of the X-ray NuSTAR\nsatellite show a clear evidence of an asymmetric collapse, we have revisited\nthe experimental data recorded by the underground and gravitational wave\ndetectors running during the SN1987A. New evidence is shown that con rms\nprevious results, namely that the data recorded by the gravitational wave\ndetectors running in Rome and in Maryland are strongly correlated with the data\nof both the Mont Blanc and the Kamiokande detectors, and that the correlation\nextends over a long period of time (one or two hours) centered at the Mont\nBlanc time. This result indicates that also Kamiokande detected neutrinos at\nthe Mont Blanc time, and these interactions were not identi ed because not\ngrouped in a burst.\n", "  The effect of self-gravity of a disk matter is evaluated by the simplest\nmodes of oscillation frequencies for perturbed circular geodesics. It is\nplotted the radial profiles of free oscillations of an equatorial circular\ngeodesic perturbed within the orbital plane or in the vertical direction. The\ncalculation is carried out to geodesics of an axisymmetric $n$-dimensional\nspacetime. The profiles are computed by examples of disks embeded in\nfive-dimensional or six-dimensional spacetime, where it is studied the motion\nof free test particles for three axisymmetric cases: (i) the Newtonian limit of\na general proposed $5D$ and $6D$ axisymmetric spacetime; (ii) a simple\nRandall-Sundrum $5D$ spacetime; (iii) general $5D$ and $6D$ Randall-Sundrum\nspacetime. The equation of motion of such particles is derived and the\nstability study is computed for both horizontal and vertical directions, to see\nhow extra dimensions could affect the system. In particular, we investigate a\ndisk constructed from Schwarzschild and Chazy-Curzon solutions with a simple\nextension for extra dimensions in the case (i), and by solving vacuum Einstein\nfield equations for a kind of Randall-Sundrum-Weyl metric in cases (ii) and\n(iii). We find that it is possible to compute a range of possible solutions\nwhere such perturbed geodesics are stable. Basicaly, the stable solutions\nappear, for the radial direction, in special cases when the system has $5D$ and\nin all cases when the system has $6D$; and, for the axial direction, in all\ncases when the system has both $5D$ or $6D$.\n", "  This is a brief survey of the all-years research activity in the Sector\n\"Supersymmetry\" (the former Markov Group) at the Bogoliubov Laboratory of\nTheoretical Physics. The focus is on the issues related to gauge fields,\nspontaneously broken symmetries in the nonlinear realizations approach, and\ndiverse aspects of supersymmetry.\n", "  We study level statistics in ensembles of integrable $N\\times N$ matrices\nlinear in a real parameter $x$. The matrix $H(x)$ is considered integrable if\nit has a prescribed number $n>1$ of linearly independent commuting partners\n$H^i(x)$ (integrals of motion) $\\left[H(x),H^i(x)\\right] = 0$, $\\left[H^i(x),\nH^j(x)\\right]$ = 0, for all $x$. In a recent work, we developed a\nbasis-independent construction of $H(x)$ for any $n$ from which we derived the\nprobability density function, thereby determining how to choose a typical\nintegrable matrix from the ensemble. Here, we find that typical integrable\nmatrices have Poisson statistics in the $N\\to\\infty$ limit provided $n$ scales\nat least as $\\log{N}$; otherwise, they exhibit level repulsion. Exceptions to\nthe Poisson case occur at isolated coupling values $x=x_0$ or when correlations\nare introduced between typically independent matrix parameters. However, level\nstatistics cross over to Poisson at $ \\mathcal{O}(N^{-0.5})$ deviations from\nthese exceptions, indicating that non-Poissonian statistics characterize only\nsubsets of measure zero in the parameter space. Furthermore, we present strong\nnumerical evidence that ensembles of integrable matrices are stationary and\nergodic with respect to nearest neighbor level statistics.\n", "  The collective dynamics in populations of magnetic spin torque oscillators\n(STO) is an intensely studied topic in modern magnetism. Here, we show that\narrays of STO coupled via dipolar fields can be modeled using a variant of the\nKuramoto model, a well-known mathematical model in non-linear dynamics. By\ninvestigating the collective dynamics in arrays of STO we find that the\nsynchronization in such systems is a finite size effect and show that the\ncritical coupling-for a complete synchronized state-scales with the number of\noscillators. Using realistic values of the dipolar coupling strength between\nSTO we show that this imposes an upper limit for the maximum number of\noscillators that can be synchronized. Further, we show that the lack of long\nrange order is associated with the formation of topological defects in the\nphase field similar to the two-dimensional XY model of ferromagnetism. Our\nresults shed new light on the synchronization of STO, where controlling the\nmutual synchronization of several oscillators is considered crucial for\napplications.\n", "  We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics induced by quantum quenches in\nquadratic Hamiltonians featuring both short- and long-range interactions. The\nspreading of correlations in the presence of algebraic decaying interactions,\n$1/R^\\alpha$, is studied for lattice Bose models in arbitrary dimension $D$.\nThese models are exactly solvable and provide useful insight in the universal\ndescription of more complex systems as well as comparisons to the known\nuniversal upper bounds for the spreading of correlations. Using analytical\ncalculations of the dominant terms and full numerical integration of all\nquasi-particle contributions, we identify three distinct dynamical regimes. For\nstrong decay of nteractions, $\\alpha>D+1$, we find a causal regime,\nqualitatively similar to what previously found for short-range interactions.\nThis regime is characterized by ballistic (linear cone) spreading of the\ncorrelations with a cone velocity equal to twice the maximum group velocity of\nthe quasi-particles. For weak decay of interactions, $\\alpha<D$, we find\ninstantaneous activation of correlations at arbitrary distance. This signals\nthe breaking of causality, which can be associated with the divergence of the\nquasi-particle energy spectrum. Finite-size scaling of the activation time\nprecisely confirms this interpretation. For intermediate decay of interactions,\n$D<\\alpha<D+1$, we find a sub-ballistic, algebraic (bent cone) spreading and\ndetermine the corresponding exponent as a function of $\\alpha$. These outcomes\ngeneralize existing results for one-dimensional systems to arbitrary dimension.\nWe precisely relate the three regimes to the first- and second-order\ndivergences of the quasi-particle energy spectrum for any dimension.\n", "  For reaction-diffusion processes with at most bimolecular reactants, we\nderive well-behaved, numerically tractable, exact Langevin equations that\ngovern a stochastic variable related to the response field in field theory.\nUsing duality relations, we show how the particle number and other quantities\nof interest can be computed. Our work clarifies long-standing conceptual issues\nencountered in field-theoretical approaches and paves the way for systematic\nnumerical and theoretical analyses of reaction-diffusion problems.\n", "  Mars is believed to have had a substantial atmosphere in the past.\nAtmospheric loss led to depressurization and cooling, and is thought to be the\nprimary driving force responsible for the loss of liquid water from its\nsurface. Recently, MAVEN observations have provided new insight into the\nphysics of atmospheric loss induced by ICMEs and solar wind interacting with\nthe Martian atmosphere. In addition to solar radiation, it is likely that its\natmosphere has been exposed to radiation bursts from high-energy astrophysical\nsources which become highly probable on timescales of ~Gy and beyond. These\nsources are capable of significantly enhancing the rates of photoionization and\ncharged particle-induced ionization in the upper atmosphere. We use Monte Carlo\nsimulations to model the interaction of charged particles and photons from\nastrophysical sources in the upper Martian atmosphere and discuss its\nimplications on atmospheric loss. Our calculations suggest that the passage of\nthe solar system though dense interstellar clouds is the most significant\ncontributor to atmospheric loss among the sources considered here.\n", "  We evaluate the performance of spin-polarized DFTB within the SCC-DFTB (also\nknown as DFTB2) model. The method has been implemented in the ADF modeling\nsuite. We briefly review how spin polarization is incorporated into the DFTB2\nmethod and validate the method in terms of structural parameters and energy\nusing the GMTKN30 test set, from which we used 288 spin-polarized systems.\n", "  We study the quantum dynamics of the kicked Dicke model(KDM) in terms of the\nFloquet operator and analyze the connection between the chaos and\nthermalization in this context. The Hamiltonian map is constructed by taking\nthe classical limit of the Heisenberg equation of motion suitably to study the\ncorresponding phase space dynamics which shows a crossover from regular to\nchaotic motion by tuning the kicking strength. The fixed point analysis and\ncalculation of the Lyapunov exponent(LE) provides us a complete picture of the\nonset of chaos in phase space dynamics. We carry out the spectral analysis of\nthe Floquet operator which include the calculation of quasienergy spacing\ndistribution, structural entropy and show the correspondence to the random\nmatrix theory in the chaotic regime. Finally, we analyze the thermodynamics and\nstatistical properties of the bosonic sector as well as the spin sector and\ndiscuss how such periodically kicked system relaxes to a thermalized state in\naccordance with the laws of statistical mechanics. We introduce the notion of\nan effective temperature and show that a microcanonical picture is emerging out\nin the thermodynamic limit indicating the thermalization occurring in such\nsystem.\n", "  We study the problem to infer the ground state of a spin-glass Hamiltonian\nusing data from another Hamiltonian with interactions disturbed by noise from\nthe original Hamiltonian, motivated by the ground-state inference in quantum\nannealing on a noisy device. It is shown that the average Hamming distance\nbetween the inferred spin configuration and the true ground state is minimized\nwhen the temperature of the noisy system is kept at a finite value, and not at\nzero temperature. We present a spin-glass generalization of a well-established\nresult that the ground state of a purely ferromagnetic Hamiltonian is best\ninferred at a finite temperature in the sense of smallest Hamming distance when\nthe original ferromagnetic interactions are disturbed by noise. We use the\nnumerical transfer-matrix method to establish the existence of an optimal\nfinite temperature in one- and two-dimensional systems. Our numerical results\nare supported by mean-field calculations, which give an explicit expression of\nthe optimal temperature to infer the spin-glass ground state as a function of\nvariances of the distributions of the original interactions and the noise. The\nmean-field prediction is in qualitative agreement with numerical data.\nImplications on postprocessing of quantum annealing on a noisy device are\ndiscussed.\n", "  In a recent work, authors prove a yet another no-go theorem that forbids the\nexistence of a universal probabilistic quantum protocol producing a\nsuperposition of two unknown quantum states. In this short note, we show that\nin the presence of closed time like curves, one can indeed create superposition\nof unknown quantum states and evade the no-go result.\n", "  We calculate the energy of one- and two-dimensional weakly interacting\nBose-Bose mixtures analytically in the Bogoliubov approximation and by using\nthe diffusion Monte Carlo technique. We show that in the case of attractive\ninter- and repulsive intraspecies interactions the energy per particle has a\nminimum at a finite density corresponding to a liquid state. We derive the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation to describe droplets of such liquids and solve it\nanalytically in the one-dimensional case.\n", "  Spectral heat kernel/zeta function regularization procedures are employed in\nthis paper to control the divergences arising from vacuum fluctuations of\nBogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield vortices in the Abelian Higgs model. Zero modes\nof vortex fluctuations are the source of difficulties appearing when the\nstandard Gilkey-de Witt expansion is performed. A modified GdW expansion is\ndeveloped to diminish the impact of the infrared divergences due to the vortex\nzero modes. With this new technique at our disposal we compute the one-loop\nvortex mass shift in the planar AHM and the quantum corrections to the string\ntension of the magnetic flux tubes living in three dimensions. In both cases it\nis observed that weak repulsive forces surge between these classically non\ninteracting topological defects caused by vacuum quantum fluctuations.\n", "  Implementing a qubit quantum computer in continuous-variable systems\nconventionally requires the engineering of specific interactions according to\nthe encoding basis states. In this work, we present a unified formalism to\nconduct universal quantum computation with a fixed set of operations but\narbitrary encoding. By storing a qubit in the parity of two or four qumodes,\nall computing processes can be implemented by basis state preparations,\ncontinuous-variable exponential-swap operations, and swap-tests. Our formalism\ninherits the advantages that the quantum information is decoupled from\ncollective noise, and logical qubits with different encodings can be brought to\ninteract without decoding. We also propose a possible implementation of the\nrequired operations by using interactions that are available in a variety of\ncontinuous-variable systems. Our work separates the `hardware' problem of\nengineering quantum-computing-universal interactions, from the `software'\nproblem of designing encodings for specific purposes. The development of\nquantum computer architecture could hence be simplified.\n", "  We discuss heat transport in thermally-biased long Josephson tunnel junctions\nin the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. In full analogy with the\nJosephson critical current, the phase-dependent component of the heat current\nthrough the junction displays coherent diffraction. Thermal transport is\nanalyzed as a function of both the length and the damping of the junction,\nhighlighting deviations from the standard Fraunhofer pattern characteristic of\nshort junctions. The heat current diffraction patterns show features strongly\nrelated to the formation and penetration of Josephson vortices, i.e. solitons.\nWe show that a dynamical treatment of the system is crucial for the realistic\ndescription of the Josephson junction and it leads to peculiar results. In\nfact, hysteretic behaviors in the diffraction patterns when the field is swept\nup and down are observed, corresponding to the trapping of vortices in the\njunction.\n", "  This paper presents a measurement of the double-differential cross section\nfor the Drell-Yan $Z/\\gamma^{*} \\rightarrow \\ell^{+} \\ell^{-}$ and\nphoton-induced $\\gamma\\gamma \\rightarrow \\ell^{+} \\ell^{-}$ processes where\n$\\ell$ is an electron or muon. The measurement is performed for invariant\nmasses of the lepton pairs, $m_{\\ell\\ell}$, between 116 GeV and 1500 GeV, using\na sample of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of pp collisions data at centre-of-mass energy of\n$\\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2012. The data\nare presented double differentially in invariant mass and absolute dilepton\nrapidity as well as in invariant mass and absolute pseudorapidity separation of\nthe lepton pair. The single-differential cross section as a function of\n$m_{\\ell\\ell}$ is also reported. The electron and muon channel measurements are\ncombined and a total experimental precision of better than 1% is achieved at\nlow $m_{\\ell\\ell}$. A comparison to next-to-next-to-leading order perturbative\nQCD predictions using several recent parton distribution functions and\nincluding next-to-leading order electroweak effects indicates the potential of\nthe data to constrain parton distribution functions. In particular, a large\nimpact of the data on the photon PDF is demonstrated.\n", "  We study the topological entanglement negativity between two spatial regions\nin (2+1)-dimensional Chern-Simons gauge theories by using the replica trick and\nthe surgery method. For a bipartitioned or tripartitioned spatial manifold, we\nshow how the topological entanglement negativity depends on the presence of\nquasiparticles and the choice of ground states. In particular, for two adjacent\nnon-contractible regions on a tripartitioned torus, the entanglement negativity\nprovides a simple way to distinguish Abelian and non-Abelian theories. Our\nmethod applies to a Chern-Simons gauge theory defined on an arbitrary oriented\n(2+1)-dimensional spacetime manifold. Our results agree with the edge theory\napproach in a recent work (X. Wen, S. Matsuura and S. Ryu, arXiv:1603.08534).\n", "  Quasiparticle properties of quantum magnets with long-range interactions are\ninvestigated by high-order linked-cluster expansions in the thermodynamic\nlimit. It is established that perturbative continuous unitary transformations\non white graphs are a promising and flexible approach to treat long-range\ninteractions in quantum many-body systems. We exemplify this scheme for the\none-dimensional transverse-field Ising chain with long-range interactions. For\nthis model the elementary Quasiparticle gap is determined allowing to access\nthe quantum-critical regime including critical exponents and multiplicative\nlogarithmic corrections for the ferro- and antiferromagnetic case.\n", "  We consider fractional generalizations of the ordinary differential equation\nthat governs the creep phenomenon. Precisely, two Caputo fractional Voigt\nmodels are considered: a rheological linear model and a nonlinear one. In the\nlinear case, an explicit Volterra representation of the solution is found,\ninvolving the generalized Mittag-Leffler function in the kernel. For the\nnonlinear fractional Voigt model, an existence result is obtained through a\nfixed point theorem. A nonlinear example, illustrating the obtained existence\nresult, is given.\n", "  We present a determination of the strange, charm and bottom quark masses as\nwell as the strong coupling constant in 2+1 flavor lattice QCD simulations\nusing highly improved staggered quark action. The ratios of the charm quark\nmass to the strange quark mass and the bottom quark mass to the charm quark\nmass are obtained from the meson masses calculated on the lattice and found to\nbe $m_c/m_s=11.871(91)$ and $m_b/m_c=4.528(57)$ in the continuum limit. We also\ndetermine the strong coupling constant and the charm quark mass using the\nmoments of pseudoscalar charmonium correlators: $\\alpha_s(\\mu=m_c)=0.3697(85)$\nand $m_c(\\mu=m_c)=1.267(12)$ GeV. Our result for $\\alpha_s$ corresponds to the\ndetermination of the strong coupling constant at the lowest energy scale so far\nand is translated to the value $\\alpha_s(\\mu=M_Z,n_f=5)=0.11622(84)$.\n", "  We report on the design and operation of a 1D magneto-granular phononic\ncrystal composed of a chain of steel spherical beads on top of permanent\nmagnets. The magnetic field of the permanent magnets induces forces in the\ngranular structure. By changing its strength, we can tune the dynamic response\nof the granular structure. We present experimental results with evidence of\ncoupled transversal-rotational modes, and zero group velocities modes. These\nobservations are well supported by a proposed model taking into account the\nmechanical coupling between the beads and the magnets by linear stiffnesses and\nincluding all degrees of freedom in translations and rotations.\n", "  We report on the detection of a bright, short, structured X-ray burst coming\nfrom the supernova remnant RCW 103 on 2016 June 22 caught by the Swift/BAT\nmonitor, and on the follow-up campaign made with Swift/XRT, Swift/UVOT and the\noptical/NIR GROND detector. The characteristics of this flash, such as\nduration, and spectral shape, are consistent with typical short bursts observed\nfrom soft gamma repeaters. The BAT error circle at 68 per cent confidence range\nencloses the point-like X-ray source at the centre of the nebula,\n1E161348-5055. Its nature has been long debated due to a periodicity of 6.67 hr\nin X-rays, which could indicate either an extremely slow pulsating neutron\nstar, or the orbital period of a very compact X-ray binary system. We found\nthat 20 min before the BAT trigger, the soft X-ray emission of 1E161348-5055\nwas a factor of ~100 higher than measured 2 yr earlier, indicating that an\noutburst had already started. By comparing the spectral and timing\ncharacteristics of the source in the two years before the outburst and after\nthe BAT event, we find that, besides a change in luminosity and spectral shape,\nalso the 6.67 hr pulsed profile has significantly changed with a clear phase\nshift with respect to its low-flux profile. The UV/optical/NIR observations did\nnot reveal any counterpart at the position of 1E161348-5055. Based on these\nfindings, we associate the BAT burst with 1E161348-5055, we classify it as a\nmagnetar, and pinpoint the 6.67 hr periodicity as the magnetar spin period.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a three-level system (ThLS) sinusoidally driven in\nboth longitudinal and transverse directions and in the presence of a uniaxial\nanisotropy $D$ entering the generic Hamiltonian through the zero-energy\nsplitting term $D(S^{z})^{2}$ where $S^{z}$ is the projection of the spin\nvector along the quantization direction. As a consequence of the addition of\nthis term, the order of the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian is increased by a\nunit and we observe a sequence of cascaded $SU(3)$\nLandau-Zener-St\\\"uckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interferometers. The study is\ncarried out by analytically and numerically calculating the probabilities of\nnon-adiabatic and adiabatic evolutions. For non-adiabatic evolutions, two main\napproximations based on the weak and strong driving limits are discussed by\ncomparing the characteristic frequency of the longitudinal drive with the\namplitudes of driven fields. For each of the cases discussed, our analytical\nresults quite well reproduce the gross temporal profile of the exact numerical\nprobabilities. This allows us to check the range of validity of analytical\nresults and confirm our assumptions. For adiabatic evolutions, a general theory\nis constructed allowing for the description of adiabatic passages in arbitrary\nThLSs in which direct transitions between states with extremal spin projections\nare forbidden. A compact formula for adiabatic evolutions is derived and\nnumerically tested for some illustrative cases. Interference patterns\ndemonstrating multiple LZSM transitions are reported. Applications of our\nresults to the Nitrogen Vacancy Center (NVC) in diamond are discussed.\n", "  We develop a model to treat the inclusive non-elastic break up reactions\ninvolving weakly bound three-cluster nuclei. Borromean, two-nucleon, halo\nnuclei are candidates of unstable three-fragments projectiles. The model is\nbased on the theory of inclusive breakup reactions commonly employed in the\ntreatment of incomplete fusion and surrogate method. The theory was developed\nin the 80's by Ichimura, Autern and Vincent (IAV) [Phys. Rev. C 32, 431 (1985)]\n\\cite{IAV1985}, Udagawa and Tamura (UT)[Phys. Rev. C 24, 1348 (1981)],\n\\cite{UT1981} and Hussein and McVoy (HM)[Nucl. Phys. A 445, 124 (1985)],\n\\cite{HM1985}. We extend these three-body theories to derive an expression for\nthe fragment yield in the reaction $A\\,(a,b)\\,X$, where the projectile is $a =\nx_1 + x_2 + b$. The inclusive breakup cross section is found to be the sum of a\ngeneralized four-body form of the elastic breakup cross section plus the\ninclusive non-elastic breakup cross section which involves the \"reaction\" cross\nsection of the participant fragments, $x_1$ and $x_2$. The final result is\nsimilar to the three-body case reviewed in Austern, et al. (Phys. Rep.\n\\textbf{154}, 125 (1987)), \\cite{Austern1987}, but with important genuine\nfour-body effects added, both in the elastic breakup cross section, which now\ncontains the full correlations between the participant fragments, and in the\ninclusive non- elastic breakup. These developments should encourage\nexperimentalists to seek more information about the $x_{1} + x_{2}$ system in\nthe elastic breakup cross section, and to theorists to further develop and\nextend the surrogate method, based on the inclusive non-elastic breakup part of\nthe $b$ spectrum.\n", "  Recently, Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory\n(aLIGO) detected gravitational wave (GW) transients from mergers of binary\nblack holes (BHs). The system may also produce a wide-angle, relativistic\noutflow if the claimed short GRB detected by GBM is in real association with GW\n150914. It was suggested that mergers of double neutron stars (or neutron\nstar-black hole binaries), another promising source of GW transients, also\nproduce fast, wide-angle outflows. In this paper, we calculate the high-energy\ngamma-ray emission arising from the blast waves driven by these wide-angle\noutflows. We find that TeV emission arising from the inverse-Compton process in\nthe relativistic outflow resulted from mergers of binary BHs similar to those\nin GW 150914 could be detectable by ground-based IACT telescopes such as\nCherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) if the sources occur in { a dense medium with\ndensity $n > 0.3 cm^{-3}$}. For neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) and NS-BH\nmergers, TeV emission from the wide-angle, mildly-relativistic outflow could be\ndetected as well if they occur in a dense medium {with $n > 10-100 cm^{-3}$.}\nThus TeV afterglow emission would be a useful probe of the environment of the\nGW transients, which could shed light on the evolution channels of the\nprogenitors of GW transients.\n", "  In this work we investigate how atomic $C_6$ coefficients and static dipole\npolarizabilities $\\alpha$ scale with effective volume. We show, using confined\natoms covering rows 1-5 of the periodic table, that $C_6/C_6^R\\approx\n(V/V^R)^{p_Z}$ and $\\alpha/\\alpha^R\\approx (V/V^R)^{p'_Z}$ (for volume $V=\\int\ndr \\frac{4\\pi}{3}r^3 n(r)$) where $C_6^R$, $\\alpha^R$ and $V^R$ are the\nreference values and effective volume of the free atom. The scaling exponents\n$p_Z$ and $p'_Z$ vary substantially as a function of element number $Z=N$, in\ncontrast to the standard \"rule of thumb\" that $p_Z=2$ and $p'_Z=1$. Remarkably,\nWe find that the polarizability and $C_6$ exponents $p'$ and $p$ are related by\n$p'\\approx p-0.615$ rather than the expected $p'\\approx p/2$. Results are\nlargely independent of the form of the confining potential (harmonic, cubic and\nquartic potentials are considered) and kernel approximation, justifying this\nanalysis.\n", "  We report the application of the resistive anode readout method on a two\ndimensional imaging GEM detector. The resistive anode consists of $6\\times6$\ncells with the cell size $6~\\mathrm{mm}\\times6~\\mathrm{mm}$. New electronics\nand DAQ system are used to process the signals from the 49 readout channels.\nThe detector has been tested by using the X-ray tube (8~keV). The spatial\nresolution of the detector is about $103.46~\\mathrm{{\\mu}m}$ with the detector\nresponse part about $66.41~\\mathrm{{\\mu}m}$. The nonlinearity of the detector\nis less than $1.5\\%$. A quite good two dimensional imaging capability is\nachieved as well. The performances of the detector show the prospect of the\nresistive anode readout method for the large readout area imaging detectors.\n", "  Self-assembly driven by phase separation coupled to Coulombic interactions is\nfundamental to a wide range of applications, examples of which include soft\nmatter lithography via di-block copolymers, membrane design using\npolyelectrolytes, and renewable energy applications based on complex\nnano-materials, such as ionic liquids. The most common mean field framework for\nthese problems is the non-local Cahn-Hilliard (a.k.a. Ohta-Kawasaki) framework.\nIn this work, we study the emergence of spatially localized states in both the\nclassical and the extended Ohta-Kawasaki model. The latter also accounts for:\n(i) asymmetries in long-range Coulomb interactions that are manifested by\ndifferences in the dielectric response, and (ii) asymmetric short-range\ninteractions that correspond to differences in the chemical potential between\ntwo materials phases. It is shown that in one space dimension (1D) there is a\nmultiplicity of coexisting localized solutions, which organize in the\nhomoclinic snaking structure, bearing similarity to dissipative systems. In\naddition, an analysis of 2D extension is performed and distinct instability\nmechanisms (related to extended and localized modes) of localized stripes are\ndiscussed with respect to model parameters and domain size. Finally,\nimplications to localized hexagonal patterns are also made. The insights\nprovide an efficient mechanistic framework to design and control localized\nself-assembly that might be a plausible strategy for low cost of nano\nelectronic applications, i.e., a rather simple nano scale fabrication of\nisolated morphologies.\n", "  We report on the Parallel Session BH4 \"Gravitational fields with sources:\nFrom compact objects to black holes\" of the 14th Marcel Grossmann Meeting held\nat Sapienza University of Rome in 2015.\n", "  Proton radii of $^{12-19}$C densities derived from first accurate charge\nchanging cross section measurements at 900$A$ MeV with a carbon target are\nreported. A thick neutron surface evolves from $\\sim$ 0.5 fm in $^{15}$C to\n$\\sim$ 1 fm in $^{19}$C. The halo radius in $^{19}$C is found to be 6.4$\\pm$0.7\nfm as large as $^{11}$Li. Ab initio calculations based on chiral\nnucleon-nucleon and three-nucleon forces reproduce well the radii.\n", "  Spreading processes are ubiquitous in natural and artificial systems. They\ncan be studied via a plethora of models, depending on the specific details of\nthe phenomena under study. Disease contagion and rumor spreading are among the\nmost important of these processes due to their practical relevance. However,\ndespite the similarities between them, current models address both spreading\ndynamics separately. In this paper, we propose a general information spreading\nmodel that is based on discrete time Markov chains. The model includes all the\ntransitions that are plausible for both a disease contagion process and rumor\npropagation. We show that our model not only covers the traditional spreading\nschemes, but that it also contains some features relevant in social dynamics,\nsuch as apathy, forgetting, and lost/recovering of interest. The model is\nevaluated analytically to obtain the spreading thresholds and the early time\ndynamical behavior for the contact and reactive processes in several scenarios.\nComparison with Monte Carlo simulations shows that the Markov chain formalism\nis highly accurate while it excels in computational efficiency. We round off\nour work by showing how the proposed framework can be applied to the study of\nspreading processes occurring on social networks.\n", "  Constrained realisations of Gaussian random fields are used in cosmology to\ndesign special initial conditions for numerical simulations. We review this\napproach and its application to density peaks providing several worked-out\nexamples. We then critically discuss the recent proposal to use constrained\nrealisations to modify the linear density field within and around the\nLagrangian patches that form dark-matter haloes. The ambitious concept is to\nforge `genetically modified' haloes with some desired properties after the\nnon-linear evolution. We demonstrate that the original implementation of this\nmethod is not exact but approximate because it tacitly assumes that protohaloes\nsample a set of random points with a fixed mean overdensity. We show that\ncarrying out a full genetic modification is a formidable and daunting task\nrequiring a mathematical understanding of what determines the biased locations\nof protohaloes in the linear density field. We discuss approximate solutions\nbased on educated guesses regarding the nature of protohaloes. We illustrate\nhow the excursion-set method can be adapted to predict the non-linear evolution\nof the modified patches and thus fine tune the constraints that are necessary\nto obtain preselected halo properties. This technique allows us to explore the\nfreedom around the original algorithm for genetic modification. We find that\nthe quantity which is most sensitive to changes is the halo mass-accretion rate\nat the mass scale on which the constraints are set. Finally we discuss\nconstraints based on the protohalo angular momenta.\n", "  We present medium-resolution spectroscopy and multicolor photometry for the\noptical transient PSN J09093496+3307204 (SN 2015bh) in the galaxy NGC 2770,\nwhich has transferred into the supernova phase. The observations were carried\nout between February 2015 to May 2016. Both at the phase of the SN impostor\n(2015a) and at the supernova phase (2015b), besides Balmer emissions, the\nstrong Fe II emissions are seen in the spectrum; so, these spectra resemble\nthose of Williams Fe II type classical novae. The star is located near the edge\nof a dark nebula and notably absorbed (Av = 1.14 +/-0.15 mag). Taking into\naccount this absorption, we determined maximum absolute magnitudes of Mv =\n-15.0 +/-0.3 mag at the 2015a phase and of Mv = -18.14 +/-0.30 mag at the 2015b\nphase. The light curve at the 2015b phase is similar to those of SN IIL. The\nsupernova progenitor is a luminous blue variable (LBV) star with the powerful\nH{\\alpha} emission. We considered several hypotheses of supernovae explosions\nfollowing optical transients related with LBV. The hypothesis of core collapse\nof an evolved massive star interrupting the process of its merging with massive\ncompanion in a binary system (a failed luminous red nova) was chosen as the\npreferable one for this event.\n", "  Gravity waves are primarily generated in the lower atmosphere, and can reach\nthermospheric heights in the course of their propagation. This paper reviews\nthe recent progress in understanding the role of gravity waves in vertical\ncoupling during sudden stratospheric warmings. Modeling of gravity wave effects\nis briefly reviewed, and the recent developments in the field are presented.\nThen, the impact of these waves on the general circulation of the upper\natmosphere is outlined. Finally, the role of gravity waves in vertical coupling\nbetween the lower and the upper atmosphere is discussed in the context of\nsudden stratospheric warmings.\n", "  We consider the reflection of light, from a stationary source, off of a\nuniformly moving flat mirror, and derive the relativistic reflection law using\nwell-known properties of conic sections. The effective surface of reflection\n(ESR) is defined as the loci of intersection of all beams, emanating from the\nsource at a given time, with the moving mirror. Fermat principle of least time\nis then applied to ESR and it is shown that, assuming the independence of speed\nof light, the result is identical with the relativistic reflection law. For a\nuniformly moving mirror ESR is a conic and the reflection law becomes a case of\nbi-angular equation of the conic, with the incident and reflected beams\ncoinciding with the focal rays of the conic. A short calculus-based proof for\naccelerating mirrors is also given.\n", "  In wall-bounded turbulence, the moment generating functions (MGFs) of the\nstreamwise velocity fluctuations $\\left<\\exp(qu_z^+)\\right>$ develop power-law\nscaling as a function of the wall normal distance $z/\\delta$. Here $u$ is the\nstreamwise velocity fluctuation, $+$ indicates normalization in wall units\n(averaged friction velocity), $z$ is the distance from the wall, $q$ is an\nindependent variable and $\\delta$ is the boundary layer thickness. Previous\nwork has shown that this power-law scaling exists in the log-region {\\small\n$3Re_\\tau^{0.5}\\lesssim z^+$, $z\\lesssim 0.15\\delta$}, where $Re_\\tau$ is the\nfriction velocity-based Reynolds numbers. Here we present empirical evidence\nthat this self-similar scaling can be extended, including bulk and\nviscosity-affected regions $30<z^+$, $z<\\delta$, provided the data are\ninterpreted with the Extended-Self-Similarity (ESS), i.e. self-scaling of the\nMGFs as a function of one reference value, $q_o$. ESS also improves the scaling\nproperties, leading to more precise measurements of the scaling exponents. The\nanalysis is based on hot-wire measurements from boundary layers at $Re_\\tau$\nranging from $2700$ to $13000$ from the Melbourne\nHigh-Reynolds-Number-Turbulent-Boundary-Layer-Wind-Tunnel. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate the scalings of the filtered, large-scale velocity fluctuations\n$u^L_z$ and of the remaining small-scale component, $u^S_z=u_z-u^L_z$. The\nscaling of $u^L_z$ falls within the conventionally defined log region and\ndepends on a scale that is proportional to {\\small $l^+\\sim Re_\\tau^{1/2}$};\nthe scaling of $u^{S}_z$ extends over a much wider range from $z^+\\approx 30$\nto $z\\approx 0.5\\delta$. Last, we present a theoretical construction of two\nmultiplicative processes for $u^L_z$ and $u^S_z$ that reproduce the empirical\nfindings concerning the scalings properties as functions of $z^+$ and in the\nESS sense.\n", "  On the basis of qualitative theory of differential equations it is shown that\ndynamic system based on the system of Einstein - Klein - Gordon equations with\nregard to Friedman Universe has a stable center corresponding to zero values of\nscalar potential and its derivative at infinity. Thus, the cosmological model\nbased on single massive classical scalar field in infinite future would give a\nflat Universe. The carried out numerical simulation of the dynamic system\ncorresponding to the system of Einstein - Klein - Gordon equations showed that\nat great times of the evolution the invariant cosmological acceleration has a\nmicroscopic oscillating character ($T\\sim 2\\pi mt$), while macroscopic value of\nthe cosmological acceleration varies from $+1$ at inflation stage after which\nif decreases fast to $-1/2$ (non-relativistic stage), and then slowly tends to\n$-1$ (ultrarelativistic stage).\n", "  Multi-filamentation opens new degrees of freedom for manipulating\nelectromagnetic waves in air. However, without control, multiple filament\ninteractions, including attraction, repulsion or fusion often result in\nformation of complex disordered filament distributions. Moreover, high power\nbeams conventionally used in multi-filament formation experiments often cause\nsignificant surface damage. The growing number of applications for laser\nfilaments requires fine control of their formation and propagation. We\ndemonstrate, experimentally and theoretically, that the attraction and fusion\nof ultrashort beams with initial powers below the critical value enable the\neventual formation of a filament downstream. Filament formation is delayed to a\npredetermined distance in space, avoiding optical damage to external beam\noptics while still enabling robust filaments with controllable properties as if\nformed from a single high power beam. This paradigm introduces new\nopportunities for filament engineering eliminating the need to use high peak\npower lasers sources.\n", "  This paper provides an alternative methodology for analysis of three-wave\ninteractions under the exact dispersion relation associated with gravity waves\nin fluid of intermediate depth. A Korteweg-de Vries type of equation with exact\ndispersion property is adopted as the governing equation for unidirectional\nwave packet evolution. Following the idea from Zakharov's seminal paper\n(Zakharov, V. E. (1968) Stability of periodic waves of finite amplitude on the\nsurface of a deep fluid. \\textit{Journal of Applied Mechanics and Technical\nPhysics}, {\\bf 9}, 190--194), the equation is transformed from the\nspatial--temporal domain to the wavenumber--temporal domain. The solution of\nthe transformed equation is sought using the perturbation theory, for which the\nansatz is expressed in the form of a regular expansion in the increasing order\nof a small parameter. After implementing the na\\\"{i}ve perturbation method, due\nto nonlinear mode generation and particular combinations of wavenumbers, the\nthird-order solution contains spurious secular growth terms which appear as a\nconsequence of resonant interaction and nonlinear mode generation. These\nspurious secular growth terms can be prevented by implementing the method of\nstrained parameters for which nonlinear dispersion relation terms are produced\nfor particular combination of wavenumbers.\n", "  We study the stability of two-fluid flow through a plane channel at Reynolds\nnumbers of a hundred to a thousand in the linear and nonlinear regimes. The two\nfluids have the same density but different viscosities. The fluids, when\nmiscible, are separated from each other by a mixed layer of small but finite\nthickness, across which viscosity changes from that of one fluid to that of the\nother. When immiscible, the interface is sharp. Our study spans a range of\nSchmidt numbers, viscosity ratios and location and thickness of the mixed\nlayer. A region of instability distinct from that of the Tollmien-Schlichting\nmode is obtained at moderate Reynolds numbers. We show that the overlap of the\nlayer of viscosity-stratification with the critical layer of the dominant\ndisturbance provides a mechanism for this instability. At very low values of\ndiffusivity, the miscible flow behaves exactly like the immiscible in terms of\nstability characteristics. High levels of miscibility make the flow more\nstable. At intermediate levels of diffusivity however, in both linear and\nnon-linear regimes, miscible flow can be more unstable than the corresponding\nimmiscible flow without surface tension.\n", "  We investigated the spinning process of a polymeric material by using a\nmultiscale simulation method which connects the macroscopic and microscopic\nstates through the stress and strain-rate tensor fields, by using Lagrangian\nparticles (filled with polymer chains) along the spinning line. We introduce a\nlarge number of Lagrangian fluid particles into the fluid, each containing\nNp-Hookean-dumbbells to mimic the polymer chains (Np=$10^4$), which is\nequivalent to the upper convected Maxwell fluid in the limit that\nNp$\\rightarrow \\infty$. Depending on the Reynolds number Re, we studied the\ndynamical behaviors of fibers for the (a) Re =0 and (b) finite Re cases, for\ndifferent draw ratios Dr, ranging from 10 to 30, and two typical Deborah\nnumbers De=$10^{-3}$ and De=$10^{-2}$. In the limit Re$\\rightarrow$ 0 (a), as\nthe Deborah number De increases, the elastic effect makes the system stable. At\nfinite Re (b), we found that inertial effects play an important role in\ndetermining the dynamical behavior of the spinning process, and for\nDr=$10^{-2}$ the system is quite stable, at least up to a draw ratio of Dr=30.\nWe also found that the fiber velocity and cross section area are determined\nsolely by the draw ratio. By comparing the velocity and cross section area\nprofiles with the end-point distribution for the dumbbell connective vectors,\nfor dumbbells located in Lagrangian particles along typical places along the\nspinning line, we show that our multiscale simulation method successfully\nbridges the microscopic state of the system with its simultaneous macroscopic\nflow behavior. It is also confirmed that the present schemes gives good\nagreements with the results obtained by the Maxwell constitutive equation.\n", "  We report the results of in-situ characterization of $ ^{87}$Rb atom cloud in\na quadrupole Ioffe configuration (QUIC) magnetic trap after radio frequency\n(RF) evaporative cooling of the trapped atom cloud. The in-situ absorption\nimages of the atom cloud have shown clear bimodal optical density (OD) profiles\nwhich indicate the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) phase transition in the\ntrapped gas. Also, we report the measured variation in the sizes of the\ncondensate and thermal clouds with the final frequency in the frequency scan of\nthe RF-field applied for evaporative cooling. The results are consistent with\nthe theoretical understanding and predictions reported earlier.\n", "  ARCHES (Astronomical Resource Cross-matching for High Energy Studies) is a\nFP7-Space funded project whose aim is to provide the international astronomical\ncommunity with well-characterised multi-wavelength data in the form of spectral\nenergy distributions (SEDs) for large samples of objects extracted from the\n3XMM DR5 X-ray catalogue of serendipitous sources. The project has developed\nnew tools implementing fully probabilistic simultaneous cross-correlation of\nseveral catalogues for unresolved sources and a multi-wavelength finder for\nclusters of galaxies for extended sources. These enhanced resources have been\ntested in the framework of several science cases.\n", "  Understanding of material behaviour at nanoscale under intense laser\nexcitation is becoming critical for future application of nanotechnologies.\nNanograting formation by linearly polarised ultra-short laser pulses has been\nstudied systematically in fused silica for various pulse energies at 3D laser\nprinting/writing conditions, typically used for the industrial fabrication of\noptical elements. The period of the nanogratings revealed a dependence on the\norientation of the scanning direction. A tilt of the nanograting wave vector at\na fixed laser polarisation was also observed. The mechanism responsible for\nthis peculiar dependency of several features of the nanogratings on the writing\ndirection is qualitatively explained by considering the heat transport flux in\nthe presence of a linearly polarised electric field, rather than by temporal\nand spatial chirp of the laser beam. The confirmed vectorial nature of the\nlight-matter interaction opens new control of material processing with\nnanoscale precision.\n", "  This contribution summarizes some of the important theoretical progress that\nhas been made in the arena of electroweak physics at hadron colliders. The\nfocus is on developments that have sharpened theoretical predictions for final\nstates produced through electroweak processes. Special attention is paid to new\nresults that have been presented in the last year, since LHCP2015, as well as\non key issues for future measurements at the LHC.\n", "  In 1928 G. Gamow as well as Condon and Gurney gave the first explanation of\nalpha decay as a quantum tunnelling of a preformed particle at the nuclear\nsurface. Soon after experimental discovery in 1984 by Rose and Jones of cluster\nradioactivity, confirming earlier (1980) predictions by Sandulescu, Poenaru and\nW. Greiner, a microscopic theory also explained the phenomenon in a similar\nway. Here we show for the first time that in a spontaneous cold fission process\nthe shell plus pairing corrections calculated with Strutinsky's procedure may\ngive a strong argument for preformation of a light fission fragment near the\nnuclear surface. It is obtained when the radius of the light fragment, $R_2$,\nis increased linearly with the separation distance, $R$, of the two fragments,\nwhile for $R_2=$~constant one gets the well known two hump potential barrier.\n", "  How can elementary grade teachers integrate programming and computational\nthinking with the science curriculum? To answer this question, we present\nresults from a long-term, design-based, microgenetic study where 1) agent-based\nprogramming using ViMAP was integrated with existing elementary science\ncurricula and 2) lessons were taught by the classroom teacher. We present an\ninvestigation of the co-development of children's computational thinking and\nscientific modeling and show that the integration of programming with\nscientific modeling can be supported by the development of sociomathematical\nnorms for designing \"mathematically good\" computational models.\n", "  When performing large-scale, high-performance computations of multi-physics\napplications, it is common to limit the complexity of physics sub-models\ncomprising the simulation. For a hierarchical system of coal boiler simulations\na scale-bridging model is constructed to capture characteristics appropriate\nfor the application-scale from a detailed coal devolatilization model. Such\nscale-bridging allows full descriptions of scale-applicable physics, while\nfunctioning at reasonable computational costs. This study presents a variation\non multi-fidelity modeling with a detailed physics model, the chemical\npercolation devolatilization model, being used to calibrate a scale-briding\nmodel for the application of interest. The application space provides essential\ncontext for designing the scale-bridging model by defining scales, determining\nrequirements and weighting desired characteristics. A single kinetic reaction\nequation with functional yield model and distributed activation energy is\nimplemented to act as the scale-bridging model-form. Consistency constraints\nare used to locate regions of the scale-bridging model's parameter-space that\nare consistent with the uncertainty identified within the detailed model.\nUltimately, the performance of the scale-bridging model with consistent\nparameter-sets was assessed against desired characteristics of the detailed\nmodel and found to perform satisfactorily in capturing thermodynamic trends and\nkinetic timescales for the desired application-scale. Framing the process of\nmodel-form selection within the context of calibration and uncertainty\nquantification allows the credibility of the model to be established.\n", "  In this letter we study the valley degeneracy splitting of the\ntransition-metal dichalcogenides monolayer by first-principles calculations.\nThe local magnetic moments are introduced into the system when the\ntransition-metal atoms are adsorbed to the monolayer surface. Zeeman effect\narising from the local magnetic moment at transition-metal atom sites lifts the\nvalley degeneracy. Anomalous charge, spin and valley Hall Effects can be\naccessed due to valley splitting when we can only excite carriers of one\nvalley. The valley splitting depends on the direction of magnetization and thus\ncan be tuned continuously by an external magnetic field. This tunable valley\nsplitting offers a practical avenue for exploring device paradigms based on the\nspin and valley degrees of freedom.\n", "  This paper reports on the epitaxial growth of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)\nfilms on sapphire substrates in a cold wall chemical vapor deposition (CVD)\nsystem where different sapphire nitridation and hBN growth temperatures were\nemployed. A thin and amorphous nitridated layer was formed at a low temperature\n(850 C), which enabled subsequent epitaxial hBN growth at 1350 C. The\ninfluences of the sapphire nitridation temperature and the growth temperature\non the film quality were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements.\nHigher than optimum nitridation and growth temperatures improve the crystalline\nquality of the nitridated layer, but does not favor the epitaxial growth of\nhBN. hBN films grown at the optimum conditions exhibit the c-lattice constant\nof 6.66 {\\AA} from the XRD {\\theta}-2{\\theta} scan, and the characteristic in\nplane stretching vibration at 1370.5/cm from Raman spectroscopy. X-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy analysis confirmed the formation of stoichiometric\nhBN films with excellent uniformity.\n", "  Thousands of confirmed and candidate exoplanets have been identified in\nrecent years. Consequently, theoretical research on the formation and dynamical\nevolution of planetary systems has seen a boost, and the processes of\nplanet-planet scattering, secular evolution, and interaction between planets\nand gas/debris disks have been well-studied. Almost all of this work has\nfocused on the formation and evolution of isolated planetary systems, and\nneglect the effect of external influences, such as the gravitational\ninteraction with neighbouring stars. Most stars, however, form in clustered\nenvironments that either quickly disperse, or evolve into open clusters. Under\nthese conditions, young planetary systems experience frequent close encounters\nwith other stars, at least during the first 1-10 Myr, which affects planets\norbiting at any period range, as well as their debris structures.\n", "  We propose a new scheme to generate high-brightness and temporal coherent\nsoft x-ray radiation in a seeded free-electron laser. The proposed scheme is\nbased the coherent harmonic generation (CHG) and superradiant principles. A CHG\nscheme is first used to generate coherent signal at ultra-high harmonics of the\nseed. This coherent signal is then amplified by a series of chicane-undulator\nmodules via the fresh bunch and superradiant processes in the following\nradiator. Using a representative of realistic set of parameters,\nthree-dimensional simulations have been carried out and the simulations results\ndemonstrated that 10 GW-level ultra-short coherent radiation pulses in the\nwater window can be achieved by using the proposed technique.\n", "  The Dirac equation has been applied to fermions scattering from the downward\npotential step. The results show some particles do not fall off the edge of the\nstep and reflect. Also, based on de Broglie-Bohm interpretation of quantum\nmechanics (Bohmian mechanics) and Bohmian trajectories we have resolved the\nproblem. Lastly, a phenomenological study of the Bohmian trajectory of the\nKlein paradox has been discussed.\n", "  We introduce a geometric quantification of quantum coherence in single-mode\nGaussian states and we investigate the behavior of distance measures as\nfunctions of different physical parameters. In the case of squeezed thermal\nstates, we observe that re-quantization yields an effect of noise-enhanced\nquantum coherence for increasing thermal photon number.\n", "  These are lecture notes of the lecture on elementary celestial mechanics read\nat Technische Universitaet Dresden, Dresden, Germany from 2000 till 2011.\n", "  This paper makes a correction to the collision rates of small droplets in\nturbulent fluid derived by Saffman and Turner(1956). Not only the distortion\nbut also the rotation of the fluid is taken into account between two close\ndroplets. A rotation reference is fixed on one drop, and the fluxes of the\nother drops moving towards the fixed one are carried out based on this new\nreference. The behaviors of turbulent flow are analyzed within the smallest\neddies under the rotation reference, and a correction is made to the collision\nrates by multiplying a factor sqrt(2).\n", "  Here we study theoretically the dynamics of a 2D and a 3D isotropic droplet\nin a nematic liquid crystal under a shear flow. We find a large repertoire of\npossible nonequilibrium steady states as a function of the shear rate and of\nthe anchoring of the nematic director field at the droplet surface. We first\ndiscuss homeotropic anchoring. For weak anchoring, we recover the typical\nbehaviour of a sheared isotropic droplet in a binary fluid, which rotates,\nstretches and can be broken by the applied flow. For intermediate anchoring,\nnew possibilities arise due to elastic effects in the nematic fluid. We find\nthat in this regime the 2D droplet can tilt and move in the flow, or tumble\nincessantly at the centre of the channel. For sufficiently strong anchoring,\nfinally, one or both of the topological defects which form close to the surface\nof the isotropic droplet in equilibrium detach from it and get dragged deep\ninto the nematic state by the flow. In 3D, instead, the Saturn ring associated\nwith normal anchoring disclination line can be deformed and shifted downstream\nby the flow, but remains always localized in proximity of the droplet, at least\nfor the parameter range we explored. Tangential anchoring in 2D leads to a\ndifferent dynamic response, as the boojum defects characteristic of this\nsituation can unbind from the droplet under a weaker shear with respect to the\nnormal anchoring case. Our results should stimulate further experiments with\ninverted liquid crystal emulsions under shear, as most of the predictions can\nbe testable in principle by monitoring the evolution of liquid crystalline\norientation patterns or by tracking the position and shape of the droplet over\ntime.\n", "  We have previously developed a polymer-like expansion that applies when the\n(effective) action in a functional integral is an analytic function of the\nfields being integrated. Here, we develop methods to aid the application of\nthis technique when the method of steepest descent is used to analyze the\nfunctional integral. We develop a version of the Banach fixed point theorem\nthat can be used to construct and control the critical fields, as analytic\nfunctions of external fields, and substitution formulae to control the change\nin norms that occurs when one replaces the integration fields by the sum of the\ncritical fields and the fluctuation fields.\n", "  Block spin renormalization group is the main tool used in our program to see\nsymmetry breaking in a weakly interacting many Boson system on a three\ndimensional lattice at low temperature. It generates operators, like the\nfluctuation integral covariance, that act on some lattice but are translation\ninvariant only with respect to a proper sublattice. This paper constructs a\nBloch/Floquet framework that is appropriate for bounding such operators.\n", "  Block spin renormalization group is the main tool used in our program to see\nsymmetry breaking in a weakly interacting many Boson system on a three\ndimensional lattice at low temperature. In this paper, we discuss some of its\npurely algebraic aspects in an abstract setting. For example, we derive some\n\"well known\" identities like the composition rule and the relation between\ncritical fields and background fields.\n", "  This paper is a contribution to a program to see symmetry breaking in a\nweakly interacting many Boson system on a three dimensional lattice at low\ntemperature. It is part of an analysis of the \"small field\" approximation to\nthe \"parabolic flow\" which exhibits the formation of a \"Mexican hat\" potential\nwell. Bounds on the fluctuation integral covariance, as well as on some other\nlinear operators, are an important ingredient in our renormalization group step\nanalysis. These bounds are proven here.\n", "  We present an analysis of the IRAS 08589-4714 star-forming region. This\nregion harbors candidate young stellar objects identified in the WISE and\nHerschel images using color index criteria and spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs). The SEDs of some of the infrared sources and the 70 microns radial\nintensity profile of the brightest source (IRS 1) are modeled from Herschel\nfluxes using the one-dimensional radiative transfer DUSTY code. For these\nobjects, we estimate the envelope masses, sizes, densities, and luminosities\nwhich suggest that they are very young, massive and luminous objects at early\nstages of the formation process. Color-color diagrams in the bands of WISE and\n2MASS are used to identify potential young objects in the region. Those\nidentified in the bands of WISE would be contaminated by the emission of PAHs.\nWe use the emission distribution in the infrared at 70 and 160 microns, to\nestimate the dust temperature gradient. This suggests that the nearby massive\nstar-forming region RCW 38, located ~ 10 pc of the IRAS source position may be\ncontributing to the photodissociation of the molecular gas and to the heating\nof the interstellar dust in the environs of the IRAS source.\n", "  We describe the preliminary design of a magnetograph and visible-light imager\ninstrument to study the solar dynamo processes through observations of the\nsolar surface magnetic field distribution. The instrument will provide\nmeasurements of the vector magnetic field and of the line-of-sight velocity in\nthe solar photosphere. As the magnetic field anchored at the solar surface\nproduces most of the structures and energetic events in the upper solar\natmosphere and significantly influences the heliosphere, the development of\nthis instrument plays an important role in reaching the scientific goals of The\nAtmospheric and Space Science Coordination (CEA) at the Brazilian National\nInstitute for Space Research (INPE). In particular, the CEA's space weather\nprogram will benefit most from the development of this technology. We expect\nthat this project will be the starting point to establish a strong research\nprogram on Solar Physics in Brazil. Our main aim is acquiring progressively the\nknow-how to build state-of-art solar vector magnetograph and visible-light\nimagers for space-based platforms to contribute to the efforts of the\nsolar-terrestrial physics community to address the main unanswered questions on\nhow our nearby Star works.\n", "  A new general equation to explain bending of arbitrary rods (from arbitrary\nmaterials, cross sections, densities, strengthnesses, bending angles, etc) was\nproposed. This equation can solve several problems found in classical\nequations, which have many limitations such as only applies for small bending\nangles or must be solved using very complex schemes. Experiments were also\nconducted to confirm the theoretical predictions. The equation might be used to\nexplain bending of palm fronds in a very simple way. The proposed equation may\nbe used to obtain solution of several problems which are usually obtain with\niteration procedures.\n", "  We present a measurement of the spatial clustering of massive compact\ngalaxies at $1.2\\le z \\le 3$ in CANDELS/3D-HST fields. We obtain the\ncorrelation length for compact quiescent galaxies (cQGs) at $z\\sim1.6$ of\n$r_{0}=7.1_{-2.6}^{+2.3}\\ h^{-1}Mpc$ and compact star forming galaxies (cSFGs)\nat $z\\sim2.5$ of $r_{0}=7.7_{-2.9}^{+2.7}\\ h^{-1}Mpc$ assuming a power-law\nslope $\\gamma =1.8$. The characteristic dark matter halo masses $M_H$ of cQGs\nat $z\\sim1.6$ and cSFGs at $z\\sim2.5$ are $\\sim7.1\\times 10^{12}\\ h^{-1}\nM_\\odot$ and $\\sim4.4\\times10^{12}\\ h^{-1} M_\\odot$, respectively. Our\nclustering result suggests that cQGs at $z\\sim1.6$ are possibly the progenitors\nof local luminous ETGs and the descendants of cSFGs and SMGs at $z>2$. Thus an\nevolutionary connection involving SMGs, cSFGs, QSOs, cQGs and local luminous\nETGs has been indicated by our clustering result.\n", "  Hybrid or metal organic framework (MOF) perovskites of general composition,\nABX$_3$, are known to show interesting properties which can lead to variety of\ntechnological applications. Our first principles study shows they are also\npotential candidates for exhibiting cooperative spin-state transitions upon\napplication of external stimuli. We demonstrate this by considering two\nspecific Fe-based MOF perovskites, namely Dimethylammonium Iron Formate,\n[CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$CH$_{3}$][Fe(HCOO)$_3$] and Hydroxylammonium Iron Formate,\n[NH$_{3}$OH][Fe(HCOO)$_3$]. Both the compounds are found to undergo high-spin\n(S=2) to low-spin (S=0) transition at Fe(II) site upon application of moderate\nstrength of hydrostatic pressure, along with large hysteresis. This spin-state\ntransition is signaled by the changes in electronic, magnetic and optical\nproperties. We find both the transition pressure and the width of the\nhysteresis to be strongly dependent of the choice of A-site cation,\nDimethylammonium or Hydroxylammonium, implying tuning of spin-switching\nproperties achievable by chemical variation of the amine cation in the\nstructure. Our finding opens up novel functionalities in this family of\nmaterials of recent interest, which can have important usage in sensors and\nmemory devices.\n", "  We use inelastic neutron scattering to study temperature and energy\ndependence of spin excitations in optimally P-doped BaFe2(As0.7P0.3)2\nsuperconductor (Tc = 30 K) throughout the Brillouin zone. In the undoped state,\nspin waves and paramagnetic spin excitations of BaFe2As2 stem from\nantiferromagnetic (AF) ordering wave vector QAF= (1/-1,0) and peaks near zone\nboundary at (1/-1,1/-1) around 180 meV. Replacing 30% As by smaller P to induce\nsuperconductivity, low-energy spin excitations of BaFe2(As0.7P0.3)2form a\nresonance in the superconducting state and high-energy spin excitations now\npeaks around 220 meV near (1/-1,1/-1). These results are consistent with\ncalculations from a combined density functional theory and dynamical mean field\ntheory, and suggest that the decreased average pnictogen height in\nBaFe2(As0.7P0.3)2 reduces the strength of electron correlations and increases\nthe effective bandwidth of magnetic excitations.\n", "  Dalton and Slawinski (2016) show that, in general, the Backus (1962) average\nand the Gazis et al. (1963) average do not commute. Herein, we examine the\nextent of this noncommutativity. We illustrate numerically that the extent of\nnoncommutativity is a function of the strength of anisotropy. The averages\nnearly commute in the case of weak anisotropy.\n", "  Artificial lights raise night sky luminance, creating the most visible effect\nof light pollution-artificial skyglow. Despite the increasing interest among\nscientists in fields such as ecology, astronomy, health care, and land-use\nplanning, light pollution lacks a current quantification of its magnitude on a\nglobal scale. To overcome this, we present the world atlas of artificial sky\nluminance, computed with our light pollution propagation software using new\nhigh-resolution satellite data and new precision sky brightness measurements.\nThis atlas shows that more than 80% of the world and more than 99% of the U.S.\nand European populations live under light-polluted skies. The Milky Way is\nhidden from more than one-third of humanity, including 60% of Europeans and\nnearly 80% of North Americans. Moreover, 23% of the world's land surfaces\nbetween 75{\\deg}N and 60{\\deg}S, 88% of Europe, and almost half of the United\nStates experience light-polluted nights.\n", "  Recently, Kobayashi et al. (arXiv:1608.07718; ref. 1) have proposed an\nalternative interpretation of our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) results for the dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As. They\nclaim that our ARPES data [Sci. Rep. 6, 27266 (2016); ref. 2] can be explained\nby locating the Fermi level EF above the valence-band top, supporting the\nimpurity-band model of ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn)As. In this comment, we show that\nthe assignment of bands' positions in respect to EF by Kobayashi et al. is not\nconsistent with our data. By comparing the ARPES result to band-structure\ncalculations, we demonstrate clearly that EF resides inside the valence band in\naccordance with the p-d Zener model.\n", "  Equal-mass stars in young open clusters and loose associations exhibit a wide\nspread of rotation periods, which likely originates from differences in the\ninitial rotation periods and in the primordial disc lifetimes. We want to\nexplore if the gravitational effects by nearby companions may play an\nadditional role in producing the observed rotation period spread. We measure\nthe photometric rotation periods of components of multiple stellar systems and\nlook for correlations of the period differences among the components to their\nreciprocal distances. In this paper, we analysed the triple system AU Mic + AT\nMic A&B in the 25-Myr beta Pictoris Association. We have retrieved from the\nliterature the rotation period of AU Mic (P = 4.85d) and measured from\nphotometric archival data the rotation periods of both components of AT Mic (P\n= 1.19d and P = 0.78d) for the first time. Moreover, we detected a high rate of\nflare events from AT Mic. Whereas the distant component AU Mic has evolved\nrotationally as a single star, the A and B components of AT Mic, separated by\nabout 27 AU, exhibit a rotation rate a factor 5 larger than AU Mic. Moreover,\nthe A and B components, despite have about equal mass, show a significant\ndifference (about 40%) between their rotation periods. A possible explanation\nis that the gravitational forces between the A and B components of AT Mic (that\nare a factor about 7.3 x 10^6 more intense than those between AU Mic and AT\nMic) have enhanced the dispersal of the AT Mic primordial disc, shortening its\nlifetime and the disc-locking phase duration, making the component A and B of\nAT Mic to rotate faster than the more distant AU Mic. We suspect that a\ndifferent level of magnetic activity between the A and B components of AT Mic\nmay be the additional parameter responsible for the difference between their\nrotation periods.\n", "  We present the observations and first results from the FIGGS2 survey. FIGGS2\nis an extension of the earlier Faint Irregular Galaxies GMRT survey (FIGGS)\ntowards faint luminosity end. The sample consists of 20 galaxies of which 15\nwere detected in HI 21cm line using the Giant Meter-wave Radio Telescope\n(GMRT). The median blue band magnitude of our sample is ~ -11.6, which is more\nthan one magnitude fainter than earlier FIGGS survey. From our GMRT\nobservations we find that, for many of our sample galaxies, the HI disks are\noffset from their optical disks. The HI diameters of the FIGGS2 galaxies show a\ntight correlation with their HI mass. The slope of the correlation is 2.08 +/-\n0.20 similar to what is found for FIGGS galaxies. We also find that for almost\nall galaxies, the HI disks are larger than the optical disks which is a common\ntrend for dwarf or spiral galaxies. The mean value of the ratio of HI to\noptical diameter is ~ 1.54.\n", "  In the present contribution we show that the relaxed micromorphic model is\nthe only non-local continuum model which is able to account for the description\nof band-gaps in metamaterials for which the kinetic energy accounts separately\nfor micro and macro-motions without considering a micro-macro coupling.\nMoreover, we show that when adding a gradient inertia term which indeed allows\nfor the description of the coupling of the vibrations of the microstructure to\nthe macroscopic motion of the unit cell, other enriched continuum models of the\nmicromorphic type may allow the description of the onset of band-gaps.\nNevertheless, the relaxed micromorphic model proves to be yet the most\neffective enriched continuum model which is able to describe multiple band-gaps\nin non-local metamaterials.\n", "  The band structure of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with valence\nband edges at different locations in the momentum space could be harnessed to\nbuild devices that operate relying on the valley degree of freedom. To realize\nsuch valleytronic devices, it is necessary to control and manipulate the charge\ndensity in these valleys, resulting in valley polarization. While this has been\ndemonstrated using optical excitation, generation of valley polarization in\nelectronic devices without optical excitation remains difficult. Here, we\ndemonstrate spin injection from a ferromagnetic electrode into a heterojunction\nbased on monolayers of WSe2 and MoS2 and lateral transport of spin-polarized\nholes within the WSe2 layer. The resulting valley polarization leads to\ncircularly polarized light emission which can be tuned using an external\nmagnetic field. This demonstration of spin injection and magnetoelectronic\ncontrol over valley polarization provides a new opportunity for realizing\ncombined spin and valleytronic devices based on spin-valley locking in\nsemiconducting TMDCs.\n", "  The epidemic spreading has been studied for years by applying the mean-field\napproach in both homogeneous case, where each node may get infected by an\ninfected neighbor with the same rate, and heterogeneous case, where the\ninfection rates between different pairs of nodes are different. Researchers\nhave discussed whether the mean-field approaches could accurately describe the\nepidemic spreading for the homogeneous cases but not for the heterogeneous\ncases. In this paper, we explore under what conditions the mean-field approach\ncould perform well when the infection rates are heterogeneous. In particular,\nwe employ the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model and compare the\naverage fraction of infected nodes in the metastable state obtained by the\ncontinuous-time simulation and the mean-field approximation. We concentrate on\nan individual-based mean-field approximation called the N-intertwined Mean\nField Approximation (NIMFA), which is an advanced approach considered the\nunderlying network topology. Moreover, we consider not only the independent and\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.) infection rate but also the infection rate\ncorrelated with the degree of the two end nodes. We conclude that NIMFA is\ngenerally more accurate when the prevalence of the epidemic is higher. Given\nthe same effective infection rate, NIMFA is less accurate when the variance of\nthe i.i.d.\\ infection rate or the correlation between the infection rate and\nthe nodal degree leads to a lower prevalence. Moreover, given the same actual\nprevalence, NIMFA performs better in the cases: 1) when the variance of the\ni.i.d.\\ infection rates is smaller (while the average is unchanged); 2) when\nthe correlation between the infection rate and the nodal degree is positive.\n", "  Since a number of years our group is engaged in the design, construction and\noperation of instruments with very high time resolution in the optical band for\napplications to Quantum Astronomy and more conventional Astrophysics. Two\ninstruments were built to perform photon counting with sub-nanosecond temporal\naccuracy. The first of the two, Aqueye+, is regularly mounted at the 1.8 m\nCopernicus telescope in Asiago, while the second one, Iqueye, was mounted at\nthe ESO New Technology Telescope in Chile, and at the William Herschel\nTelescope and Telescopio Nazionale Galileo on the Roque (La Palma, Canary\nIslands). Both instruments deliver extraordinarily accurate results in optical\npulsar timing. Recently, Iqueye was moved to Asiago to be mounted at the 1.2 m\nGalileo telescope to attempt, for the first time ever, experiments of optical\nintensity interferometry (a` la Hanbury Brown and Twiss) on a baseline of a few\nkilometers, together with the Copernicus telescope. This application was one of\nthe original goals for the development of our instrumentation. To carry out\nthese measurements, we are experimenting a new way of coupling the instruments\nto the telescopes, by means of moderate-aperture, low-optical-attenuation\nmulti-mode optical fibers with a double-clad design. Fibers are housed in\ndedicated optical interfaces attached to the focus of another instrument of the\n1.8 m telescope (Aqueye+) or to the Nasmyth focus of the 1.2 m telescope\n(Iqueye). This soft-mount solution has the advantage to facilitate the mounting\nof the photon counters, to keep them under controlled temperature and humidity\nconditions (reducing potential systematics related to varying ambient\nconditions), and to mitigate scheduling requirements. Here we will describe the\nfirst successful implementation of the Asiago intensity interferometer and\nfuture plans for improving it.\n", "  Streptococcus mutans cells form robust biofilms on human teeth and are\nstrongly related to caries incidents. Hence, understanding the adhesion of S.\nmutans in the human oral cavity is of major interest for preventive dentistry.\nIn this study, we report on AFM-based single cell force spectroscopy\nmeasurements of S. mutans cells to hydroxyapatite surfaces. We observe a\nsignificant increase of adhesion strength if S. mutans cells were exposed to\nhuman saliva before adhesion. In contrast, Staphylococcus carnosus cells are\nalmost unaffected by the pre-treatment. Our results demonstrate that S. mutans\ncells are well-adapted to their natural environment, the oral cavity. This\nability promotes the biofilm-forming capability of that species and hence the\nproduction of caries-provoking acids. In consequence, understanding the\nfundamentals of this mechanism may pave a way towards more effective\ncaries-reducing techniques.\n", "  On 2015 January 6-7, an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) was\nobserved at L1. This event, which can be associated with a weak and slow\ncoronal mass ejection, allows us to discuss on the differences between the\nboundaries of the magnetic cloud and the compositional boundaries. A fast\nstream from a solar coronal hole surrounding this ICME offers a unique\nopportunity to check the boundaries' process definition and to explain\ndifferences between them. Using Wind and ACE data, we perform a complementary\nanalysis involving compositional, magnetic, and kinematic observations\nproviding relevant information regarding the evolution of the ICME as\ntravelling away from the Sun. We propose erosion, at least at the front\nboundary of the ICME, as the main reason for the difference between the\nboundaries, and compositional signatures as the most precise diagnostic tool\nfor the boundaries of ICMEs.\n", "  We show, with both experiment and theory, that adsorption of $CO_2$ is\nsensitive to charge on a capturing model carbonaceous surface. In the\nexperiment we dope superfluid helium droplets with $C_{60}$ and $CO_2$ and\nexpose them to ionising free electrons. Both positively and negatively charged\n$C_{60}(CO_2)_n^{+/-}$ cluster ion distributions are observed with a\nhigh-resolution mass spectrometer and these show remarkable and reproducible\nanomalies in intensities that are strongly dependent on the charge. The highest\nadsorption capacity is seen with $C_{60}^+$. Complementary density functional\ntheory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations provided insight into\nthe nature of the interaction of charged $C_{60}$ with $CO_2$ as well as trends\nin the packing of $C_{60}^+$ and $C_{60}^-$. The quadrupole moment of $CO_2$\nitself was seen to be decisive in determining the charge dependence of the\nobserved adsorption features. Our findings are expected to apply to adsorption\nof $CO_2$ by charged surfaces in general.\n", "  Magneto-optical permittivity tensor spectra of undoped InSb, n-doped and\np-doped InSb crystals were determined using the terahertz time-domain\nspectroscopy (THz-TDS) and the Fourier transform far-infrared spectroscopy\n(far-FTIR). A Huge polar magneto-optical (MO) Kerr-effect (up to 20 degrees in\nrotation) and a simultaneous plasmonic behavior observed at low magnetic field\n(0.4 T) and room temperature are promising for terahertz nonreciprocal\napplications. We demonstrate the possibility of adjusting the the spectral rage\nwith huge MO by increase in n-doping of InSb. Spectral response is modeled\nusing generalized magneto-optical Drude-Lorentz theory, giving us precise\nvalues of free carrier mobility, density and effective mass consistent with\nelectric Hall effect measurement.\n", "  The philosopher Plato is remembered even today by scientists, and his\nwritings are still inspiring the scientific research. In the present short note\n(intended essentially for public outreach) two examples are briefly\nillustrated: 1) the European space project that bears his name, dedicated to\nthe discovery of exoplanets; 2) the discussion about platonism in contemporary\nphysics.\n", "  Relativistic shocks are one of the most plausible sites of the emission of\nstrongly variable, polarized multi-wavelength emission from relativistic jet\nsources such as blazars, via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) of relativistic\nparticles. This paper summarizes recent results on a self-consistent coupling\nof diffusive shock acceleration and radiation transfer in blazar jets. We\ndemonstrate that the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of blazars\nstrongly constrain the nature of hydromagnetic turbulence responsible for\npitch-angle scattering by requiring a strongly energy-dependent pitch-angle\nmean free path. The prominent soft X-ray excess (\"Big Blue Bump\") in the SED of\nthe BL Lac object AO 0235+164 can be modelled as the signature of bulk Compton\nscattering of external radiation fields by the thermal electron population,\nwhich places additional constraints on the level of hydromagnetic turbulence.\nIt has further been demonstrated that internal shocks propagating in a jet\npervaded by a helical magnetic field naturally produce polarization-angle\nswings by 180$^o$, in tandem with multi-wavelength flaring activity, without\nrequiring any helical motion paths or other asymmetric jet structures. The\nspecific application of this model to 3C279 presents the first consistent,\nsimultaneous modeling of snap-shot SEDs, multi-wavelength light curves and\ntime-dependent polarization signatures of a blazar during a polarization-angle\n(PA) rotation. This model has recently been generalized to a lepto-hadronic\nmodel, in which the high-energy emission is dominated by proton synchrotron\nradiation. It is shown that in this case, the high-energy (X-ray and\n$\\gamma$-ray) polarization signatures are expected to be significantly more\nstable (not showing PA rotations) than the low-energy (electron-synchrotron)\nsignatures.\n", "  We briefly review some aspects of the anomalous diffusion, and its relevance\nin reactive systems. In particular we consider {\\it strong anomalous} diffusion\ncharacterized by the moment behaviour $\\langle x(t)^q \\rangle \\sim t^{q\n\\nu(q)}$, where $\\nu(q)$ is a non constant function, and we discuss its\nconsequences. Even in the apparently simple case $\\nu(2)=1/2$, strong anomalous\ndiffusion may correspond to non trivial features, such as non Gaussian\nprobability distribution and peculiar scaling of large order moments.\n  When a reactive term is added to a normal diffusion process, one has a\npropagating front with a constant velocity. The presence of anomalous diffusion\nby itself does not guarantee a changing in the front propagation scenario; a\nkey factor to select linear in time or faster front propagation has been\nidentified in the shape of the probability distribution tail in absence of\nreaction. In addition, we discuss the reaction spreading on graphs, underlying\nthe major role of the connectivity properties of these structures,\ncharacterized by the {\\em connectivity dimension}\n", "  We compare two alternative expansions for finite attractive wells. One of\nthem is known from long ago and is given in terms of powers of the strength\nparameter. The other one is based on the solution of the equations of the\nRayleigh-Schr\\\"{o}dinger perturbation theory in a basis set of functions of\nperiod $L$. The analysis of exactly solvable models shows that although the\nexact solution of the problem with periodic boundary conditions yields the\ncorrect result when $L\\rightarrow \\infty$ the coefficients of the series for\nthis same problem blow up and fail to produce the correct asymptotic expansion.\n", "  We investigate front propagation in systems with diffusive and sub-diffusive\nbehavior. The scaling behavior of moments of the diffusive problem, both in the\nstandard and in the anomalous cases, is not enough to determine the features of\nthe reactive front. In fact, the shape of the bulk of the probability\ndistribution of the transport process, which determines the diffusive\nproperties, is important just for pre-asymptotic behavior of front propagation,\nwhile the precise shape of the tails of the probability distribution determines\nasymptotic behavior of front propagation.\n", "  While detailed information about the semiclassics for single-particle systems\nis available, much less is known about the connection between quantum and\nclassical dynamics for many-body systems. As an example, we focus on spin\nchains which are of considerable conceptual and practical importance. We derive\na trace formula for coupled spin $j$ particles which relates the quantum energy\nlevels to the classical dynamics. Our derivation is valid in the limit\n$j\\rightarrow\\infty$ with $j\\hbar={\\rm const.}$ and applies to time-continuous\nas well as to periodically driven dynamics. We provide a simple explanation why\nthe Solari-Kochetov phase can be omitted if the correct classical Hamiltonian\nis chosen.\n", "  We present the analytic solution for the stationary quantum HamiltonJacobi\nequation. Knowing the strong relation between the Riccati and quantum\nHamilton-Jacobi equations, we develop a simple method to obtain the exact\nsolution. Then, in order to prove the validity of the proposed method, we use\ntwo central potentials: the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator and Coulomb\npotential, both with bound-states. Finally, we compute the action-angle\nvariables in a entirely quantum version for to achieve connect with the nodes\nof the wave function.\n", "  Charge transport through single molecules can be influenced by the charge and\nspin states of redox-active metal centres placed in the transport pathway.\nThese molecular intrinsic properties are usually addressed by varying the\nmolecules electrochemical and magnetic environment, a procedure that requires\ncomplex setups with multiple terminals. Here we show that oxidation and\nreduction of organometallic compounds containing either Fe, Ru or Mo centres\ncan solely be triggered by the electric field applied to a two-terminal\nmolecular junction. Whereas all compounds exhibit bias-dependent hysteresis,\nthe Mo-containing compound additionally shows an abrupt voltage-induced\nconductance switching, yielding high to low current ratios exceeding 1000 at\nvoltage stimuli of less than 1.0 V. DFT calculations identify a localized,\nredox active molecular orbital that is weakly coupled to the electrodes and\nclosely aligned with the Fermi energy of the leads because of the\nspin-polarised ground state unique to the Mo centre. This situation opens an\nadditional slow and incoherent hopping channel for transport, triggering a\ntransient charging effect of the entire molecule and a strong hysteresis with\nunprecedented high low-to-high current ratios.\n", "  Using infrared spectroscopy combined with ab initio methods we study\nreactions of H$_2$O and CO inside the confined spaces of Zn-MOF-74 channels.\nOur results show that, once the water dissociation reaction\nH$_2$O$\\;\\rightarrow\\;$OH+H takes place at the metal centers, the addition of\n40 Torr of CO at 200 $^{\\circ}$C starts the production of formic acid via\nOH+H+CO$\\;\\rightarrow\\;$HCO$_2$H. Our detailed analysis shows that the overall\nreaction H$_2$O+CO$\\;\\rightarrow\\;$HCO$_2$H takes place in the confinement of\nMOF-74 without an external catalyst, unlike the same reaction on flat surfaces.\nThis discovery has several important consequences: It opens the door to a new\nset of catalytic reactions inside the channels of the MOF-74 system, it\nsuggests that a recovery of the MOF's adsorption capacity is possible after it\nhas been exposed to water (which in turn stabilizes its crystal structure), and\nit produces the important industrial feedstock formic acid.\n", "  Deep inelastic scattering (DIS) of charged leptons off scalar mesons in the\n$1/N$ expansion is studied by using the gauge/gravity duality. We focus on the\nD3D7-brane system and investigate the corresponding structure functions by\nconsidering both the high energy limit and the $1/N$ expansion. These limits do\nnot commute. From the D7-brane DBI action we derive a Lagrangian at sub-leading\norder in the D7-brane fluctuations and obtain a number of interactions some of\nwhich become relevant for two-hadron final-state DIS. By considering first the\nhigh energy limit followed by the large $N$ one, our results fit lattice QCD\ndata within $1.27\\%$ for the first three moments of $F_2$ for the lightest\npseudoscalar meson.\n", "  Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) might have formed in the early Universe as a\nconsequence of the collapse of density fluctuations with an amplitude above a\ncritical value $\\delta_{c}$: the formation threshold. Although for a\nradiation-dominated Universe $\\delta_{c}$ remains constant, if the Universe\nexperiences some dust-like phases (e.g. phase transitions) $\\delta_{c}$ might\ndecrease, improving the chances of PBH formation. We studied the evolution of\n$\\delta_{c}$ during the QCD phase transition epoch within three different\nmodels: Bag Model (BM), Lattice Fit Model (LFM), and Crossover Model (CM). We\nfound that the reduction on the background value of $\\delta_{c}$ can be as high\nas $77\\%$ (BM), which might imply a $\\sim10^{-10}$ probability of PBHs forming\nat the QCD epoch.\n", "  In this letter, we describe a novel scheme for searching for physics beyond\nthe Standard Model. The idea is based on correlation of time-synchronized\nreadouts of distant ($\\gtrsim$100~km) optical magnetometers. Such an approach\nlimits hard-to-identify local transient noise, providing the system with unique\ncapabilities of identification of global transient events. Careful analysis of\nthe signal can reveal the nature of the events (e.g., its nonmagnetic origin),\nwhich opens avenues for new class of exotic-physics searches (searches for\nglobal transient exotic spin couplings) and tests of yet unverified theoretical\nmodels.\n", "  We use an extract from an interview concerning gravitational wave physics to\nshow that the meaning of hesitancies within speech are different when spoken\nand when read from the corresponding transcript. When used in speech,\nhesitancies can indicate a pause for thought, when read in a transcript they\nindicate uncertainty. In a series of experiments the perceived uncertainty of\nthe transcript was shown to be higher than the perceived uncertainty of the\nspoken version with almost no overlap for any respondent. We propose that\nfinding and the method could be the beginning of a new subject we call\n'Language Code Analysis' which would systematically examine how meanings change\nwhen the 'same' words are communicated via different media and symbol systems.\n", "  Porous polymer membranes via electrostatic complexation triggered by\nneutralization are fabricated for the first time from a water-soluble\npoly(ionic liquid) (PIL). The porous structure is formed as a consequence of\nsimultaneous phase separation of the PIL and ionic complexation, which occurred\nin a basic solution of a non-solvent for the PIL. These membranes have a\nstimuli-responsive porosity, with open and closed pores in isopropanol and in\nwater, respectively. This property is quantitatively demonstrated in filtration\nexperiments, where water is passing much slower through the membranes than\nisopropanol.\n", "  Herein we report the synthesis of a series of\npoly(4-alkyl-1-vinyl-1,2,4-triazolium) poly(ionic liquid)s either via\nstraightforward free radical polymerization of their corresponding ionic liquid\nmonomers, or via anion metathesis of the polymer precursors bearing halide as\ncounter anion. The ionic liquid monomers were first prepared via N-alkylation\nreaction of commercially available 1-vinyl-1,2,4-triazole with alkyl iodides,\nfollowed by anion metathesis with targeted fluorinated anions. The thermal\nproperties and solubilities of these poly(ionic liquid)s have been\nsystematically investigated. Interestingly, it was found that the\npoly(4-ethyl-1-vinyl-1,2,4-triazolium) poly(ionic liquid) exhibited an improved\nloading capacity of transition metal ions in comparison with its imidazolium\ncounterpart.\n", "  We study the connection between urban scaling, fundamental allometry (between\ncity population and city area), and per capita vs.\\ population density scaling.\nFrom simple analytical derivations we obtain the relation between the 3\ninvolved exponents. We discuss particular cases and ranges of the exponents\nwhich we illustrate in a \"phase diagram\". As we show, the results are\nconsistent with previous work.\n", "  The departure from perfect spherical symmetry in the case of fullerenes, C60\nbeing the sole exception, induces instabilities due to the stresses generated\nby the pentagonal protrusions in the sigma-bonded surfaces. By assuming sigma\nand pi separability and treating pi electrons as a degenerate Fermi gas in the\ntwo shells around the central sigma structure, the resulting degeneracy\npressures can further enhance the sigma-surface initiated instabilities for\nnon-icosahedral structures especially for those smaller than C60 as well as the\nicosahedral fullerenes that are larger than C60, with large protrusions. Under\ncertain circumstances the net degeneracy pressure across the sigma surface\nmight have structure-stabilizing effect. The role of the pi electron degeneracy\nin a broad range of fullerenes from C20 to C1500 and its effects on fullerene\nstability is investigated.\n", "  We present an optically induced remanent photostriction in BiFeO3, resulting\nfrom the photovoltaic effect, which is used to modify the ferromagnetism of Ni\nfilm in a hybrid BiFeO3/Ni structure. The 75% change in coercivity in the Ni\nfilm is achieved via optical and nonvolatile control. This photoferromagnetic\neffect can be reversed by static or ac electric depolarization of BiFeO3.\nHence, the strain dependent changes in magnetic properties are written\noptically, and erased electrically. Light-mediated straintronics is therefore a\npossible approach for low-power multistate control of magnetic elements\nrelevant for memory and spintronic applications.\n", "  As a key energy challenge, we urgently require a better understanding of how\ngrowing urban populations interact with municipal energy systems and the\nresulting impact on energy demand across city neighborhoods, which are dense\nhubs of both consumer population and CO2 emissions. Currently, the physical\ncharacteristics of urban infrastructure are the main determinants in predictive\nmodeling of the demand side of energy in our rapidly growing urban areas;\noverlooking influence related to fluctuating human activities. Here, we show\nhow applying intra-urban human mobility as an indicator for interactions of the\npopulation with local energy systems can be translated into spatial imprints to\npredict the spatial distribution of energy use in urban settings. Our findings\nestablish human mobility as an important element in explaining the spatial\nstructure underlying urban energy flux and demonstrate the utility of a human\nmobility driven approach for predicting future urban energy demand with\nimplications for CO2 emission strategies.\n", "  In this paper, we present Clifford+T gates based quantum circuit design of\ninteger division having $n$ ancillary qubits. The proposed quantum circuit is\nbased on restoring division algorithm. The proposed quantum circuit of integer\ndivision consists of (i) quantum circuitry of conditional addition operation,\n(ii) quantum circuitry of integer subtraction. To design ancillary and T-count\noptimized design of quantum integer division, the optimized quantum circuit\ndesign of integer conditional addition operation and integer subtraction are\npresented. The proposed quantum integer division circuitry has 50\\% improvement\nin terms of ancillary qubits, and 90\\% improvement in terms of T-count compared\nto the existing design of integer quantum division based on quantum fourier\ntransform.\n", "  Stochastic acceleration of particles under a pressure balance condition can\naccommodate the universal $p^{-5}$ spectra observed under many different\nconditions in the inner heliosphere. In this model, in order to avoid an\ninfinite build up of particle pressure, a relationship between the momentum\ndiffusion of particles and the adiabatic deceleration in the solar wind must\nexist. This constrains both the spatial and momentum diffusion coefficients and\nresults in the $p^{-5}$ spectrum in the presence of adiabatic losses in the\nsolar wind. However, this theory cannot explain the presence of such spectra\nbeyond the termination shock, where adiabatic deceleration is negligible. To\nexplain this apparent discrepancy, we include the effect of charge exchange\nlosses, resulting in new forms of both the spatial and momentum diffusion\ncoefficients that have not previously been considered. Assuming that the\nturbulence is of a large-scale compressible nature, we find that a balance\nbetween momentum diffusion and losses can still readily lead to the creation of\n$p^{-5}$ suprathermal tails, including those found in the outer heliosphere.\n", "  In extra dimension theories if the gauge bosons of the standard model\npropagate in the bulk of the extra dimensions then they will have Kaluza-Klein\nexcitations that can couple to the standard model fermions. In this paper we\nstudy the effects of the first excited Kaluza-Klein mode of the W on single top\nproduction at the Tevatron. We find that the cross section for the single top\nproduction can be significantly reduced if the mass of the first Kaluza-Klein\nexcited $W \\sim 1$ TeV. Hence, a measurement of the single top production cross\nsection smaller than the standard model prediction would not necessarily imply\n$V_{tb} <1$ or evidence of extra generation(s) of fermions mixed with the third\ngeneration.\n", "  The QED radiative corrections to virtual Compton scattering (reaction $e p\n\\to e p \\gamma$) are calculated to first order in $\\alpha_{em} \\equiv e^2 / 4\n\\pi$. A detailed study is presented for the one-loop virtual corrections and\nfor the first order soft-photon emission contributions. Furthermore, a full\nnumerical calculation is given for the radiative tail, corresponding with\nphoton emission processes, where the photon energy is not very small compared\nwith the lepton momenta. We compare our results with existing works on elastic\nelectron-proton scattering, and show for the $e p \\to e p \\gamma$ reaction how\nthe observables are modified due to these first order QED radiative\ncorrections. We show results for both unpolarized and polarized observables of\nthe virtual Compton scattering in the low energy region (where one is sensitive\nto the generalized polarizabilities of the nucleon), as well as for the deeply\nvirtual Compton scattering.\n", "  The constraints of electric dipole moments (EDMs) of electron and neutron on\nthe parameter space in supergravity (SUGRA) models with nonuniversal gaugino\nmasses are analyzed. It is shown that with a light sparticle spectrum, the\nsufficient cancellations in the calculation of EDMs can happen for all phases\nbeing order of one in the small tan$\\beta$ case and all phases but $\\phi_{\\mu}$\n($|\\phi_{\\mu}| <\\sim \\pi/6$) order of one in the large tan$\\beta$ case. This is\nin contrast to the case of mSUGRA in which in the parameter space where\ncancellations among various SUSY contributions to EDMs happen $|\\phi_{\\mu}|$\nmust be less than $\\pi/10$ for small $tan\\beta$ and ${\\cal{O}}(10^{-2})$ for\nlarge $tan\\beta$. Direct CP asymmetries and the T-odd polarization of lepton in\n$B\\to X_s l^+l^-$ are investigated in the models. In the large tan$\\beta$ case,\n$A_{CP}^2$ and $P_N$ for l=$\\mu$ ($\\tau$) can be enhanced by about a factor of\nten (ten) and ten (three) respectively compared to those of mSUGRA.\n", "  Ask a group of particle theorists about low energy hadron physics and they\nwill say that this is a subject that belongs to the age of the dinosaurs.\n  However, it is GeV physics that controls the outcome of every hadronic\ninteraction at almost every energy. Confinement of quarks and gluons (and any\nother super-constituents) means that it is the femto-universe that determines\nwhat experiments detect.\n  What we have to learn at the start of the 21st century is discussed.\n", "  The photon production rate from a chemically equilibrating quark-gluon plasma\nlikely to be produced at RHIC (BNL) and LHC (CERN) energies is estimated taking\ninto account bremsstrahlung. The plasma is assumed to be in local thermal\nequilibrium, but with a phase space distribution that deviates from the Fermi\nor Bose distribution by space-time dependent factors (fugacities). The photon\nspectrum is obtained by integrating the photon rate over the space-time history\nof the plasma, adopting a boost invariant cylindrically symmetric transverse\nexpansion of the system with different nuclear profile functions. Initial\nconditions obtained from a self-screened parton cascade calculation and, for\ncomparison, from the HIJING model are used. Compared to an equilibrated plasma\nat the same initial energy density, taken from the self-screened parton\ncascade, a moderate suppression of the photon yield by a factor of one to five\ndepending on the collision energy and the photon momentum is observed. The\nindividual contributions to the photon production, however, are completely\ndifferent in the both scenarios.\n", "  Magnetic moments of baryons composed of light and strange quarks are computed\nfor the first time through the only parameter of the model -- string tension\n$\\sigma$. Resulting theoretical values differ from the experimental ones\ntypically by about\n  10%.\n", "  We calculate high-energy photoproduction of the tensor meson $f_2(1270)$ by\nodderon and photon exchange in the reaction $\\gamma + {\\rm{p}} \\to f_2(1270) +\n{\\rm{X}}$, where X is either the nucleon or the sum of the N(1520) and N(1535)\nbaryon resonances. Odderon exchange dominates except at very small transverse\nmomentum, and we find a cross section of about 20 nb at a centre-of-mass energy\nof 20 GeV. This result is compared with what is currently known experimentally\nabout $f_2$ photoproduction. We conclude that odderon exchange is not ruled out\nby present data. On the contrary, an odderon-induced cross section of the above\nmagnitude may help to explain a puzzling result observed by the E687\nexperiment.\n", "  Recently it has been proposed that the physical spectrum of a vector-like\ngauge field theory may exhibit an enhanced global symmetry near a\nchiral/conformal phase transition. The new symmetry is related to the\npossibility, supported by various investigations, that a parity-doubled\nspectrum develops as the number of fermions Nf is increased to a critical value\nabove which it is expected that the symmetric phase is restored.\n  We show that parity-doubling together with the associated enhanced global\nsymmetry severely constrains the epsilon terms of the effective Lagrangian\ninvolving Goldstone bosons as well as massive spin-1 particles. We extend our\nanalysis to underlying fermions in pseudo-real representations of the gauge\ngroup.\n", "  We consider the Kaluza-Klein scenario in which gravity propagates in the\n$4+n$ dimensional bulk of spacetime and the Standard Model particles are\nconfined to a 3-brane. We calculate the gauge boson self-energy corrections\narising from the exchange of virtual gravitons and present our results in the\n$STU$-formalism. We find that the new physics contributions to $S$, $T$ and $U$\ndecouple in the limit that the string scale $M_S$ goes to infinity. The oblique\nparameters constrain the lower limit on $M_S$. Taking the quantum gravity\ncutoff to be $M_S$,\n  $S$-parameter constraints impose $M_S>1.55$ TeV for $n=2$ at the 1$\\sigma$\nlevel. $T$-parameter constraints impose $M_S>1.25 (0.75)$ TeV for $n=3 (6)$.\n", "  We discuss the problem of solar hep neutrinos originating from the reaction p\n+ 3He -> 4He + e+ + nu and obtain a relation between the astrophysical S-factor\nof the hep process and the cross section of the process e- + 4He -> 3H + n + nu\nnear threshold. The relation is based on the isotopic invariance of strong\ninteractions.\n  The measurement of the latter cross section would allow to obtain\nexperimental information on S(hep), the value of which, at the moment, is known\nonly from theoretical calculations.\n", "  Yukawa couplings between Higgs bosons and quarks in supersymmetric theories\ncan be measured in the processes e^+e^- -> Q Qbar + Higgs. We have determined\nthe cross sections of these processes in the minimal supersymmetric model\nincluding the complete set of next-to-leading order QCD corrections for all\nchannels.\n", "  We examine how accurately the general HZV couplings, with V=Z,gamma, may be\ndetermined by studying e^+e^- --> Hff-bar processes at future e^+e^- linear\ncolliders. By using the optimal-observable method, which makes use of all\navailable experimental information, we find out which combinations of the\nvarious HZV coupling terms may be constrained most efficiently with high\nluminosity. We also assess the benefits of measuring the tau-lepton helicities,\nidentifying the bottom-hadron charges, polarizing the electron beam and running\nat two different collider energies. The HZZ couplings are generally found to be\nwell constrained, even without these options, while the HZ-gamma couplings are\nnot. The constraints on the latter may be significantly improved by beam\npolarization.\n", "  Recently, by studying exact flat directions of non-Abelian singlet fields, we\ndemonstrated the existence of free fermionic heterotic-string models in which\nthe SU(3)_C x SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y-charged matter spectrum, just below the string\nscale, consists solely of the MSSM spectrum. In this paper we generalize the\nanalysis to include VEVs of non-Abelian fields. We find several,\nMSSM-producing, exact non-Abelian flat directions, which are the first such\nexamples in the literature. We examine the possibility that hidden sector\ncondensates lift the flat directions.\n", "  A direct experimental proof of very strong T-invariance violation in\ninteractions of the photons with atoms and molecules exists in the molecular\nphysics.\n", "  We consider the single-spin azimuthal asymmetries recently measured at the\nHERMES experiment for charged pions produced in semi-inclusive deep inelastic\nscattering of leptons off longitudinally polarized protons. Guided by the\nexperimental results and assuming a vanishing twist-2 transverse quark spin\ndistribution in the longitudinally polarized nucleon, denoted as ``reduced\ntwist-3 approximation'', a self-consistent description of the observed\nsingle-spin asymmetries is obtained. In addition, predictions are given for the\nz dependence of the single target-spin asymmetry.\n", "  We consider laboratory experiments that can detect stable, neutral strongly\ninteracting massive particles (SIMPs). We explore the SIMP annihilation cross\nsection from its minimum value (restricted by cosmological bounds) to the barn\nrange, and vary the mass values from a GeV to a TeV.\n  We also consider the prospects and problems of detecting such particles at\nthe Tevatron.\n", "  We have obtained the neutrino mass matrix with the large mixing angle (LMA)\nMSW solution,\n  $\\sin^2 2\\th_\\odot=0.65\\sim 0.97$ and $\\Delta m_{\\odot}^2= 10^{-5}\\sim\n10^{-4}\\eV^2$, in the $S_{3L}\\times S_{3R}$ flavor symmetry. The structure of\nour neutrino mass matrix is found to be stable against radiative corrections.\n", "  Following an argument by Kirzhnits we rederive an exact expression for the\nenergy loss of a fast charged particle in a relativistic plasma using the\nquantum field theoretical language. We compare this result to perturbative\ncalculations of the collisional energy loss of an energetic electron or muon in\nan electron-positron plasma and of an energetic parton in the quark-gluon\nplasma.\n", "  We explicitly check quark-hadron duality to order $(m_b-m_c)\\Lambda/m_b^2$\nfor $b \\to c l\\nu$ decays in the limit $m_b-m_c \\ll m_b$ including ground state\nand orbitally excited hadrons. Duality occurs thanks to a new sum rule which\nexpresses the subleading HQET form factor $\\xi_3$ or, in other notations,\n  $a_+^{(1)}$ in terms of the infinite mass limit form factors and some level\nsplittings. We also demonstrate the sum rule, which is not restricted to the\ncondition $m_b-m_c \\ll m_b$, applying OPE to the longitudinal axial component\nof the hadronic tensor without neglecting the $1/m_b$ subleading contributions\nto the form factors. We argue that this method should produce a new class of\nsum rules, depending on the current, beyond Bjorken, Voloshin and the known\ntower of higher moments. Applying OPE to the vector currents we find another\nderivation of the Voloshin sum rule. From independent results on $\\xi_3$ we\nderive a sum rule which involves only the $\\tau_{1/2}^{(n)}$ and\n$\\tau_{3/2}^{(n)}$ form factors and the corresponding level splittings. The\nlatter strongly supports a theoretical evidence that the $B$ semileptonic decay\ninto narrow orbitally-excited resonances dominates over the decay into the\nbroad ones, in apparent contradiction with some recent experiments. We discuss\nthis issue.\n", "  The phase equivalence of the theoretical quark mixing matrix ${\\bf V}^{th}$\nderived from the breaking of the flavour permutational symmetry and the\nphenomenological parametrizations ${\\bf V}^{PDG}$ and ${\\bf V}^{KM}$ is\nexplicitly exhibited. From here, we derive exact explicit expressions for the\nthree mixing angles and the CP violating phase of the two phenomenological\nparametrizations in terms of the quark mass ratios $(m_{u}/m_{t}, m_{c}/m_{t},\nm_{d}/m_{b}, m_{s}/m_{b})$ and the parameters $Z^{*1/2}$ and $\\Phi^*$\ncharacterizing the preferred symmetry breaking pattern. The computed values for\nthe CP violating phase and the mixing angles of the standard parametrization\nadvocated by the Particle Data Group are $\\delta^*_{13}=73.2^\\circ$,\n$\\sin\\theta^*_{12}=0.222$,\n  $\\sin\\theta^*_{13}=0.0036$, and $\\sin\\theta^*_{23}=0.040$. The computed\nvalues of the CP-violating phase and the mixing angles of the Kobayashi-Maskawa\nparametrization are $\\delta^*_{KM}=96.4^\\circ$, $\\sin\\theta^*_{1}=0.2225$,\n$\\sin\\theta^*_{2}=0.0384$, and $\\sin\\theta^*_{3}=0.0162$. In both cases, the\nnumerical values of the mixing angles and CP-violating phase computed from\nquark masses and the flavour symmetry breaking parameters coincide almost\nexactly with the central values of the same parameters obtained from a fit to\nexperimental data.\n", "  We consider a random matrix model which describes the competition between\nchiral symmetry breaking and the formation of quark Cooper pairs in QCD at\nfinite density. We study the evolution of the phase structure in temperature\nand chemical potential with variations of the strength of the interaction in\nthe quark-quark channel and demonstrate that the phase diagram can realize a\ntotal of six different topologies. A vector interaction representing\nsingle-gluon exchange reproduces a topology commonly encountered in previous\nQCD models, in which a low-density chiral broken phase is separated from a\nhigh-density diquark phase by a first-order line. The other five topologies\neither do not possess a diquark phase or display a new phase and new critical\npoints. Since these five cases require large variations of the coupling\nconstants away from the values expected for a vector interaction, we conclude\nthat the phase diagram of finite density QCD has the topology suggested by\nsingle-gluon exchange and that this topology is robust.\n", "  We calculate the radiative corrections to the current-current correlator of\nthe hybrid current $g\\bar q(x)\\gamma_{\\nu}iG_{\\mu\\nu}^aT^aq(x)$. Based on this\nnew result we use the QCD sum rule approach to estimate lower bounds on the\nmasses of the $J^{PC}$=$1^{-+}$ and $0^{++}$ light hybrids.\n", "  We discuss the evolution of U(1) symmetric scalar field at the inflation\nepoch with a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone tilt revealing after the end of exponential\nexpansion of the Universe. The U(1) symmetry is supposed to be associated with\nbaryon charge. It is shown that quantum fluctuations lead in natural way to\nbaryon dominated Universe with antibaryon excess regions. The range of\nparameters is calculated at which the fraction of Universe occupied by\nantimatter and the size of antimatter regions satisfy the observational\nconstraints, survive to the modern time and lead to effects, accessible to\nexperimental search for antimatter.\n", "  The production of a neutralino pair via gluon-gluon fusion is studied in the\nminimal supersymmetric model(MSSM) at proton-proton colliders. The numerical\nanalysis of their production rates are carried out in the mSUGRA scenario. The\nresults show that this cross section may reach about 80 femto barn for\n  $\\tilde{\\chi}^{0}_{1}\\tilde{\\chi}^{0}_{2}$ pair production and 23 femto barn\nfor $\\tilde{\\chi}^{0}_{2}\\tilde{\\chi}^{0}_{2}$ pair production with suitable\ninput parameters at the future LHC collider. It shows that this loop mediated\nprocess can be competitive with the quark-antiquark annihilation process at the\nLHC.\n", "  We show that, for Majorana neutrinos propagating in a constant magnetic\nfield, the flavour survival probabilities for left-handed neutrinos is the same\nas for right-handed neutrinos, i.e., $P^M (\\nu_{\\alpha L}\\to\\nu_{\\alpha L}) =\n  P^M (\\nu_{\\alpha R}\\to\\nu_{\\alpha R})$, where $\\alpha = e, \\mu, \\tau$,\nwhereas in the Dirac case the corresponding probabilities $P^D (\\nu_{\\alpha\nL}\\to\\nu_{\\alpha L})$ and $P^D (\\bar\\nu_{\\alpha R}\\to\\bar\\nu_{\\alpha R})$ are\nin general different. This might lead to a novel way to search for the nature\nof neutrinos. We also discuss how this relation for Majorana neutrinos gets\nmodified when the magnetic field is not constant. However, if matter effects\nbecome important the relation does not hold anymore.\n", "  In order to settle the fundamental question whether the nuclear forces\ninvolve the long range components, the S-wave amplitude of the proton-proton\nscattering is analysed in search for the extra singularity at $\\nu=0$, which\ncorresponds to the long range force. To facilitate the search, a function,\nwhich is free from the singularities in the neighborhood of $\\nu=0$ when all\nthe interactions are short range, is constructed. The calculation of such a\nfunction from the phase shift data reveals a sharp cusp at $\\nu=0$ in\ncontradiction to the meson theory of the nuclear force. The type of the extra\nsingularity at $\\nu=0$ is close to what is expected in the case of the strong\nvan der Waals interaction. Physical meanings of the long range force in the\nnuclear force are discussed.\n  Low energy p-p experiments to confirm directly the strong long range\ninteraction are also proposed, in which the characteristic interference patten\nof the Coulonb and the Van der Waals forces is predicted.\n", "  We discuss a problem concerning the ultrahigh energy neutrino propagation\nthrough the Earth. We present calculation of the neutrino-nucleon cross section\nat high energies, based on the unifed evolution equation at small x.\n  We also show the solution of the transport equation for different neutrino\nfluxes originating from active galactic nuclei, gamma ray bursts and top-down\nmodel.\n", "  I discuss a Monte Carlo algorithm for hadronization in the Lund string\nfragmentation picture, which conserves energy and momentum exactly as is\nproposed by the model. An embryo to this Monte Carlo is used to calculate the\ntotal decay density of a string. This is found to reach its predicted\nasymptotic behaviour already at a string energy of about six hadron masses.\n", "  The most suitable way to study the jet quenching as a function of distance\ntraversed is varying the impact parameter b of ultrarelativistic\nnucleus-nucleus collision (initial energy density in nuclear overlapping zone\nis almost independent of b up to b R_A). It is shown that b-dependences of\nmedium-induced radiative and collisional energy losses of a hard parton jet\npropagating through dense QCD-matter are very different. The experimental\nverification of this phenomenon could be performed for a jet with non-zero cone\nsize basing on essential difference between angular distributions of\ncollisional and radiative energy losses.\n", "  Effective tree Chiral Lagrangian is interpreted as a power series expansion\nof the kinematical variables. In the presence of the strong interaction this\nexpansion is valid below the unitarity cut, hence in the unphysical region.\n  Consequences of this reinterpretation of the Chiral Lagrangian are analysed\nfor the relation between K-pi and K-pipi transitions.\n", "  We re-examine the neutrino decay solution to the solar neutrino problem in\nthe light of the SuperKamiokande (SK) data. For the decay solution the SK\nspectrum data by its own can provide a fit comparable to the fit obtained from\nthe MSW solution. However when one combines the results from the total rates of\nthe $^{37}{Cl}$ and $^{71}{Ga}$ experiments the fit becomes much poorer.\n", "  Systems that exhibit pattern formation are typically driven and dissipative.\nIn the early universe, parametric resonance can drive explosive particle\nproduction called preheating. The fields that are populated then decay quantum\nmechanically if their particles are unstable. Thus, during preheating, a\ndriven-dissipative system exists. We have shown previously that pattern\nformation can occur in two dimensions in a self-coupled inflaton system\nundergoing parametric resonance. In this paper, we provide evidence of pattern\nformation for more realistic initial conditions in both two and three\ndimensions. In the one-field case, we have the novel interpretation that these\npatterns can be thought of as a network of domain walls. We also show that the\npatterns are spatio-temporal, leading to a distinctive, but probably\nlow-amplitude peak in the gravitational wave spectrum. In the context of a\ntwo-field model, we discuss putting power from resonance into patterns on\ncosmological scales, in particular to explain the observed excess power at 100\nh^{-1}Mpc, but why this seems unlikely in the absence of a period of\npost-preheating inflation. Finally we note our model is similar to that of the\ndecay of DCCs and therefore pattern formation may also occur at RHIC and LHC.\n", "  By running the prospective high-energy e^+ e^- collider TESLA in the GigaZ\nmode on the Z resonance, experiments can be performed on the basis of more than\n10^9 Z events. They will allow the measurement of the effective electroweak\nmixing angle to an accuracy of approximately +- 10^-5. Likewise the W boson\nmass is expected to be measurable with an error of about 6 MeV near the W^+ W^-\nthreshold. In this note, we study the accuracy with which the Higgs boson mass\ncan be determined from loop corrections to these observables in the Standard\nModel. The comparison with a directly observed Higgs boson may be used to\nconstrain new physics scales affecting the virtual loops. We also study\nconstraints on the heavy Higgs particles predicted in the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model, which are very difficult to observe directly for\nlarge masses. Similarly, it is possible to constrain the mass of the heavy\nscalar top particle.\n", "  In the standard model (SM) the lowest order contribution to the quark\nelectric dipole moment (EDM) occurs at the three loop level. We show that the\nnon-unitarity of the CKM matrix in models with an extended quark sector\ntypically gives rise to a quark EDM at the two loop level which has no GIM-like\nsuppression factors except the external quark mass. The induced neutron EDM is\nof order 10^{-29} e cm and can be well within the reach of the next generation\nof experiments if it is further enhanced by long distance physics as happens in\nthe SM.\n", "  We investigate the different perturbative QCD-based models for nuclear\nshadowing of gluons. We show that in the kinematic region appropriate to RHIC\nexperiment, all models give similar estimates for the magnitude of gluon\nshadowing. At scales relevant to LHC, there is a sizable difference between\npredictions of the different models.\n", "  We numerically calculate two-particle correlation functions of CERN-SPS 158\n  A GeV Pb+Pb central collisions based on a (3+1)-dimensional relativistic\nhydrodynamics with a first order phase transition. We analyze the pair momentum\ndependence of pion source sizes extracted from the\n  Yano-Koonin-Podgoretski\\u{\\i} (YKP) parametrization which is expected to give\nthe source sizes directly. We find that, even in the case of the first order\nphase transition, the collective expansion and surface dominant freeze-out of\nthe fluid naturally lead to the opaque source for which the interpretation of\nthe temporal source parameter as the emission duration breaks down.\n", "  We present theoretical evidence that the exclusive/inclusive ratio of\nsemileptonic $\\Lambda_b$-decays exceeds that of semileptonic B-decays where the\nexperimental exclusive/inclusive ratio amounts to about 66%. We start from the\nobservation that the spectator quark model provides a lower bound on the\nleading order Isgur-Wise function of the $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda_c$ transition\nin terms of the corresponding $B \\to D,D^*$ mesonic Isgur-Wise function. Using\nexperimental data for the $B \\to D,D^*$ mesonic Isgur-Wise functions this bound\nis established. Applying a Bethe-Salpeter model including spectator quark\ninteractions and a QCD sum rule estimate of the $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda_c$\ntransition form factor which satisfy the spectator quark model bound we predict\nthe exclusive/inclusive ratio of semileptonic $\\Lambda_b$ decay rates to lie in\na range between 0.81 and 0.92. We also provide an upper bound on the baryonic\nIsgur-Wise function which is determined from the requirement that the exclusive\nrate should not exceed the inclusive rate.\n", "  Neutralino proton cross sections are examined for models with R-parity\ninvariance with universal soft breaking (mSUGRA) models, nonuniversal SUGRA\nmodels, and D-brane models. The region of parameter space where current dark\nmatter detectors are sensitive, i.e. $1\\times 10^{-6}$ pb, is examined. For\nmSUGRA models, detectors are sampling parts of the parametr space for tan$\\beta\n>\\sim 25$. The nonuniversal models can achieve cross sections that are a factor\nof 10-100 bigger or smaller then the universal one and in the former case\nsample regions tan$\\beta >\\sim 4$. The D-brane models considered require\ntan$\\beta >\\sim 15$. The inclusion of CP violating phases reduces the cross\nsection by a factor of $\\sim$ 2-3 (but also requires considerable fine tuning\nat the GUT scale). The expected particle spectra at accelerators are examined\nand seen to differ for each model. Three new regions of possible coannihilation\nare noted.\n", "  We re-analyse the prospects of discovering supersymmetry at the LHC, in order\nto re-express coverage in terms of a fine-tuning parameter and to extend the\nanalysis to scalar masses (m_0) above 2 TeV.\n  We use minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) unification assumptions for the SUSY\nbreaking parameters. The discovery reach at high m_0 is of renewed interest\nbecause this region has recently been found to have a focus point, leading to\nrelatively low fine-tuning, and because it remains uncertain how much of the\nregion can be ruled out due to lack of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking.\n  The best fine tuning reach is found in a mono-leptonic channel, where for\nmu>0, A_0=0 and tan beta=10\n  (within the focus point region), and a top mass of 174 GeV, all points in\nmSUGRA with m_0 < 4000 GeV, with a fine tuning measure up to 210 (500) are\ncovered by the search, where the definition of fine-tuning excludes (includes)\nthe contribution from the top Yukawa coupling. Even for arbitrarily high m_0,\nmSUGRA can be discovered through gaugino events, provided the gaugino mass\nparameter M_1/2 < 460 GeV. In this region, the mono-leptonic channel still\nprovides the best reach.\n", "  We report on a study aimed to explore the dependence of the genuine\nmultiparticle correlations on the number of sources when the influence of other\npossible factors during multihadron production are avoided. The analysis\nutilised the normalised cumulants calculated in three-dimensional phase space\nof the reaction ee -> Z -> hadrons using a large Monte Carlo sample.\n  The multi-sources events were simulated by overlaying a few independent\nsingle ee annihilation events.\n  It was found that as the number of sources increases, the cumulants do not\nchange significantly their structure, but those of an order higher than two\ndecrease fast in their magnitude.\n  This reduction and its amount can be understood in terms of combinatorial\nconsiderations of source mixing which dilutes the correlations.\n  The diminishing of the genuine correlations is consistent with recent\ncumulant measurements in hadron and nucleus induced reactions and should also\nbe relevant to other dynamical correlations like the Bose-Einstein one, in ee\n-> WW -> hadrons and in nucleus-nucleus reactions.\n", "  The differential cross sections for $\\pi^- p \\to \\gamma n$ and $\\pi^+ n \\to\n\\gamma p$ are computed up to $O(p^3)$ in heavy baryon chiral perturbation\ntheory (HBChPT). The expressions at $O(p)$ and $O(p^2)$ have no free\nparameters. There are three unknown parameters at $O(p^3)$, low energy\nconstants of the HBChPT Lagrangian, which are determined by fitting to\nexperimental data. Two acceptable fits are obtained, which can be separated by\ncomparing with earlier dispersion relation calculations of the inverse process.\nExpressions for the multipoles, with emphasis on the p-wave multipoles, are\nobtained and evaluated at threshold. Generally the results obtained from the\nbest of the two fits are in good agreement with the dispersion relation\npredictions.\n", "  It is studied that `no-scale' model makes hierarchy between scalar top mass\nand Z boson mass naturally. The supersymmetry breaking parameters are\nconstrained by flavor changing neutral currents in minimal supersymmetric\nstandard model. One of the solution of the problem is that gaugino mass is the\nonly source of the supersymmetry breaking parameters at Planck scale. However,\nin such scenario, we need a cancellation between Higgs mass parameters in\nminimization condition of the Higgs potential. We insist that there is no such\ncancellation in no-scale model, and that the no-scale model gives us the\nprediction of scalar top mass and lightest Higgs mass. The lightest Higgs mass\nis predicted as $m_H = 110 \\pm 5 $ GeV.\n", "  We present an analysis of the low-energy implications of an intermediate\nscale ~10^{11} GeV string theory.\n  We mainly focus on the evolution of the physical parameters under the\nrenormalisation group equations (RGEs) and find several interesting new\nfeatures that differ from the standard GUT scale or Planck scale scenarios. We\ngive a general discussion of soft supersymmetry breaking terms in type I\ntheories and then investigate the renormalization group running. In the dilaton\ndomination scenario, we present the sparticle spectra, analyzing constraints\nfrom charge and colour breaking, fine tuning and radiative electroweak symmetry\nbreaking. We compare with the allowed regions of parameter space when the RGEs\nstart running at the standard GUT or the intermediate scales, and find quite\nremarkably that the dilaton dominated supersymmetry breaking scenario, which is\nessentially ruled out from constraints on charge and colour breaking if the\nfundamental scale is close to the Planck mass, is allowed in a large region of\nparameter space if the fundamental scale is intermediate.\n", "  The collapse of sufficiently large closed domain wall produced during second\norder phase transition in the vacuum state of a scalar field can lead to the\nformation of black hole. The origin of domain walls with appropriate size and\nenergy density could be a result of evolution of an effectively massless scalar\nfield at the inflational epoch. We demonstrate that in this case the situation\nis valued when there are compact domains of less favorable vacuum surrounded by\na sea of another vacuum. Each domain has a surface composed of vacuum wall that\nstores a significant amount of energy, and can collapse into the black hole.\nThis offers the way of massive primordial black holes formation in the early\nUniverse.\n", "  It has been suggested recently that an arbitrary induced theta-vacuum state\ncould be created in heavy ion collisions. If such a state can be created, it\nwould decay by various mechanisms to the fundamental theta=0 state which is the\ntrue ground state of our world. In the following we will discuss the\npossibility of studying this unusual state through the emission of pions,\neta-mesons, and eta'-mesons. We will also present the spectrum of the produced\nparticles in this non-zero theta background. We use the instantaneous\nperturbation theory for our estimates.\n", "  Two topics are covered in this paper. In the first part the relation between\nquark mass matrices and observable quantities in gauge theories. In the second\npart neutrino masses and mixings in a seesaw framework.\n", "  We discuss the procedure to resum large logarithms to all orders for DIS\nevent shape variable distributions.\n  Results are described for two variants of the thrust variable, both defined\nwrt the boson axis in the current hemisphere of the Breit frame, but with\ndifferent normalisations.\n", "  It has been recently observed that small violations of Lorentz invariance, of\na type which may arise in quantum gravity, could explain both the observations\nof cosmic rays above the GZK cutoff and the observations of 20-TeV gamma rays\nfrom Markarian 501. We show here that different pictures of the short-distance\nstructure of space-time would lead to different manifestations of\nLorentz-invariance violation. Specifically, the deformation of Lorentz\ninvariance needed to resolve these observational paradoxes can only arise\nwithin commutative short-distance pictures of space-time. In noncommutative\nspace-times there is no anomalous effect, at least at leading order. Also\nexploiting the fact that arrival-time delays between high energy photons with\ndifferent energies would arise in both the commutative and the noncommutative\nLorentz-violation pictures, we describe an experimental programme, based on\ntime-of-arrival analysis of high energy photons and searches of violations of\nGZK and TeV-photon limits, which could discriminate between alternative\nscenarios of Lorentz-invariance breakdown and could provide and unexpected\nwindow on the (quantum) nature of space-time at very short distances.\n", "  A recent paper on energy dependence of strangeness production in A+A and p+p\ninteractions written by Dunlop and Ogilvie (Phys. ReV. C61 031901(R) (2000)\nindicates that there is a significant misunderstanding about the concept of\nstrangeness enhancement and its role as a signal of Quark Gluon Plasma\ncreation.\n  In this comment we will try to clarify some essential points.\n", "  Broadening of the transverse momentum of a parton propagating through a\nmedium is treated using the color dipole formalism, which has the advantage of\nbeing a well developed phenomenology in deep-inelastic scattering and soft\nprocesses. Within this approach, nuclear broadening should be treated as color\nfiltering, i.e. absorption of large-size dipoles leading to diminishing\n(enlarged) transverse separation (momentum). We also present a more intuitive\nderivation based on the classic scattering theory of Moli\\`ere. This derivation\nhelps to understand the origin of the dipole cross section, part of which comes\nfrom attenuation of the quark, while another part is due to multiple\ninteractions of the quark. It also demonstrates that the lowest-order\nrescattering term provides an A-dependence very different from the generally\naccepted A^{1/3} behavior. The effect of broadening increases with energy, and\nwe evaluate it using different phenomenological models for the unintegrated\ngluon density. Although the process is dominated by soft interactions, the\nphenomenology we use is tested using hadronic cross section data.\n", "  We consider the decay K^0 (K^0 bar) -> pi^+ pi^- e^+ e^- of a neutral K meson\nprepared in a state of strangeness +1 (-1). The time evolution of the state\nproduces remarkable time-dependent effects in the angular distribution of the\npi^+ pi^- e^+ e^- system. These effects are correlated with the time-dependence\nof the photon polarization in the radiative decay K^0 (K^0 bar) -> pi^+ pi^-\ngamma. We study, in particular, the CP-odd, T-odd term in the distribution d\nGamma / d phi of the angle between the pi^+ pi^- and the e^+ e^- planes. We\nalso give the spectrum in the case that the decaying meson is an incoherent\nmixture of K^0 and K^0 bar, and discuss the case of K_S regeneration in a K_L\nbeam.\n", "  We re-examine the possibility of an astrophysically allowed KSVZ-type axion\nthat has a strongly suppressed coupling to photons. We then investigate the\nimpact of such ''hadronic axions'' on two classes of astrophysical objects:\nblack hole accretion disc (BHAD) based gamma-ray bursts and isolated\nneutron-stars. Although our results are sensitive to details of the underlying\nmodels, we show that hadronic axions could in principle play an important role\nin the evolution of gamma-ray bursts and in the cooling behaviour of neutron\nstars.\n", "  The $\\gamma^* \\gamma \\to \\pi \\pi \\pi$ reaction is analysed in QCD at large\nphoton virtuality Q and small hadronic mass W. Its amplitude factorizes in a $3\n\\pi$ generalized distribution amplitude and a hard subprocess $\\gamma^* \\gamma\n\\to q \\bar q$ or $\\gamma^* \\gamma \\to g g$. The interference of this process\nwith a Brehmsstrahlung process in e e or $e \\gamma$ collisions gives rise to\ninteresting single spin asymmetries, particularly when W is near the $\\omega$\nmass.\n", "  The contribution of the proton polarizability to the hydrogen hyperfine\nsplitting is evaluated on the basis of modern experimental and theoretical\nresults on the proton polarized structure functions. The value of this\ncorrection is equal to 1.4 ppm.\n", "  In extensions of the standard model (SM) with d extra dimensions at the TeV\nscale the virtual exchange of Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations of the gauge bosons\ngives contributions that change the SM relations between electroweak\nobservables. These corrections are finite only for d=1; for d\\ge 2 the infinite\ntower of KK modes gives a divergent contribution that has to be regularized\nintroducing a cutoff (the string scale). However, the ultraviolet dependence of\nthe KK effects is completely different if the running of the couplings with the\nscale is taken into account. We find that for larger d the number of\nexcitations at each KK level increases, but their larger number is compensated\nby the smaller value of the gauge coupling at that scale. As a result, for any\nnumber of extra dimensions the exchange of the complete KK tower always gives a\nfinite contribution. We show that (i) for d=1 the running of the gauge coupling\ndecreases an 14% the effect of the KK modes on electroweak observables; (ii) in\nall cases more than 90% of the total effect comes from the excitations in the\nseven lowest KK levels and is then independent of ultraviolet physics.\n", "  In the framework of the HIJING model global characteristics of nucleus-\nnucleus collisions are studied for a Large Hadron Collider energy scale. An\ninteresting model prediction is the presence of a central bump over a\npseudorapidity plateau of a total transverse energy distribution. The bump is\ninduced by a jet quenching effect in a dense nuclear matter. It is shown that\non a wide acceptance calorimeter with a pseudorapidity coverage\n  -5 < \\eta < 5 allow to obtain experimental confirmation of such an effect.\n", "  Double meson production of the eta and pion at the threshold region is\ninvestigated in order to determine chiral property of the nucleon.\n  The eta can be used as a probe for the negative parity nucleon $N^* \\equiv\nN^*(1535)$ produced in the intermediate state.\n  The coupling of the low energy pion in the final state is then used to\nextract the sign of the Yukawa coupling, $\\gpRR$, which distinguishes the two\nrealizations of chiral symmetry, either naive or mirror, for the nucleon.\n", "  A dispersion relation formalism for the virtual Compton scattering (VCS)\nreaction on the proton is presented, which for the first time allows a\ndispersive evaluation of 4 generalized polarizabilities at a four-momentum\ntransfer $Q^2 \\leq$ 0.5 GeV$^2$. The dispersive integrals are calculated using\na state-of-the-art pion photo- and electroproduction analysis. The dispersion\nformalism provides a new tool to analyze VCS experiments above pion threshold,\nthus increasing the sensitivity to the generalized polarizabilities of the\nnucleon.\n", "  A review is given of the very recent developments in the fields of real and\nvirtual Compton scattering off the nucleon. Both real and virtual Compton\nscattering reactions are discussed at low outgoing photon energy where one\naccesses polarizabilities of the nucleon. The real Compton scattering at large\nmomentum transfer is discussed which is asymptotically a tool to obtain\ninformation on the valence quark wave function of the nucleon. The rapid\ndevelopments in deeply virtual Compton scattering and associated meson\nelectroproduction reactions at high energy, high photon virtuality and small\nmomentum transfer to the nucleon are discussed. A unified theoretical\ndescription of those processes has emerged over the last few years, which gives\naccess to new, generalized parton distributions. The experimental status and\nperspectives in these fields are also discussed.\n", "  The structure functions g1p and g1n have been measured over the range 0.014 <\nx < 0.9 and 1 < Q2 < 40 GeV2 using deep-inelastic scattering of 48 GeV\nlongitudinally polarized electrons from polarized protons and deuterons. We\nfind that the Q2 dependence of g1p (g1n) at fixed x is very similar to that of\nthe spin-averaged structure function F1p (F1n). From a NLO QCD fit to all\navailable data we find $\\Gamma_1^p - \\Gamma_1^n =0.176 \\pm 0.003 \\pm 0.007$ at\nQ2=5 GeV2, in agreement with the Bjorken sum rule prediction of 0.182 \\pm\n0.005.\n", "  In this investigation we present a detailed study of $\\partial F_2/\\partial\n\\ln Q^2$ which is supported by a coupled analysis of $J/\\Psi$ photo and DIS\nproduction. Both channels are directly proportional to $xG(x,Q^2)$, and as such\nserve as excellent discriminators between different approaches and models.\n  We then show that taking GRV98NLO as input and correcting it for SC, we can\nreproduce the recent HERA data well. The calculation depends on one parameter\n$R^2=8.5GeV^{-2}$ which is directly determined from the $J/\\Psi$\nphotoproduction forward differential slope. With this input we obtain an\nexcellent fit to the $J/\\Psi$ photo and DIS production data. Our calculations\nmade in the LLA of pQCD take into account the corrections implied by the real\npart of the production amplitude, off diagonal (skewed) gluon distributions and\nthe Fermi motion of the charm quarks within the bound Charmonium system.\n", "  We present the first systematic study of higher-twist light-cone distribution\namplitudes of the nucleon in QCD. We find that the valence three-quark state is\ndescribed at small transverse separations by eight independent distribution\namplitudes. One of them is leading twist-3, three distributions are twist-4 and\ntwist-5, respectively, and one is twist-6. A complete set of distribution\namplitudes is constructed, which satisfies equations of motion and constraints\nthat follow from conformal expansion. Nonperturbative input parameters are\nestimated from QCD sum rules.\n", "  We present a strategy for the systematic extraction of a vast amount of\ndetailed information on polarized parton densities and fragmentation functions\nfrom semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering l+N -> l+h+X, in both LO and NLO\nQCD. A method is suggested for estimating the errors involved in the much\nsimpler, and therefore much more attractive,\n  LO analysis. The approach is based upon a novel interplay with data from\ninclusive DIS and from e+e- -> hX, and leads to a much simplified form of the\nNLO expressions. No assumptions are made about the equality of any parton\ndensities and the only symmetries utilised are charge conjugation invariance\nand isotopic spin invariance of strong interactions.\n", "  We show the specific unusual features on chiral gauge anomalies cancellation\nin the minimal, necessarily 3-3-1, and the largest\n  3-4-1 weak isospin chiral gauge semisimple group leptoquark-bilepton\nextensions of the 3-2-1 conventional standard model of nuclear and\nelectromagnetic interactions. In such models a natural explanation for the\nfundamental question of fermion generation replication arises from the\nself-consistency of a local gauge quantum field theory, which constrains the\nnumber of the\n  QFD fermion families to the QCD color charges.\n", "  We study, at the one loop level, the dominant new physics contributions from\nextra dimensions to Z -> b,b(bar), as well as B-B(bar) and K-K(bar) mixing. We\nuse a model with one extra dimension containing fermions which live in four\ndimensions, and gauge bosons and one scalar doublet propagating in five\ndimensions. We find that the effect of the infinite tower of Kaluza-Klein modes\nin Z-> b,b(bar) is finite and gives a negative correction to\nR_b=Gamma_b/Gamma_h, which is used to set a lower bound of 1 TeV on the\ncompactification scale M_c. On the other hand, we show that the box diagrams\ncontributing to B-B(bar) and K-K(bar) mixing are divergent and, after proper\nregularization, we find that they increase the value of the function S(x_t)\nwhich governs this mixing. The obtained value is perfectly compatible with\navailable data.\n", "  Rich experimental data accumulated in the past few years in the hadronic\n$Z^0$ decays allow one to check the quark combinatorics relations for a new\ntype of processes, namely: quark jets in the decays $Z^0 \\to q\\bar q \\to\nhadrons$. In this paper we review quark combinatorics rules for the yields of\nvector and pseudoscalar mesons, $V/P$, in the central and fragmentation regions\nof the hadronic $Z^0$ decays. It is stressed that in the central region a\ndirect verification of quark combinatorics rules is rather problematic because\nof a considerable background related to the decay of highly excited resonances;\nhowever such a verification is possible in the fragmentation region, at\n$x_{hadron} \\sim 0.5-1$, where the contribution of resonance decays is\nsuppressed due to the rapid decrease of spectra with increasing $x_{hadron}$.\nIt is shown that the experimental data in the fragmentation region for\n$\\rho^0/\\pi^0$ and $p/\\pi^+$ are in a reasonable agreement with the predictions\nof quark combinatorics. The ratios of the heavy meson yields, $B^*/B$ and\n  $D^*/D$, are also discussed: the data demonstrate a good agreement with the\nquark combinatorial results. We analyse the structure of the suppression\nparameters for strange and heavy quark productions in soft processes and\nestimate their order of magnitudes in the multiperipheral processes; the ratio\n$K^{\\pm}/\\pi^{\\pm}$ at $x_{hadron}\\sim 0.5-0.8$ and production probabilities of\nthe $c\\bar c$ and $b \\bar b$ mesons are in a good agreement with the estimates.\n", "  We study the 4-point function in the Keldysh formalism of the closed time\npath formulation of real time finite temperature field theory.\n  We derive the KMS conditions for these functions and discuss the number of\n4-point functions that are independent. We define a set of `physical' functions\nwhich are linear combinations of the usual Keldysh functions. We show that\nthese functions satisfy simple KMS conditions. In addition, we consider a set\nof integral equations which represent a resummation of ladder graphs. We show\nthat these integral equations decouple when one uses the physical functions\nthat we have defined. We discuss the generalization of these results to QED.\n", "  We propose to use the Balescu-Lenard-Vlasov (BLV) equation to describe\nrelativistic heavy ion collisions. We use an inter-quark Richardson's potential\nconsistent with the indications of Lattice QCD calculations. The color degrees\nof freedom are explicitly taken into account.\n  We explicitly demonstrate that the Vlasov approach alone is insufficient in\nthe hadronization region.\n  In order to overcome this problem we prepare the initial condition for many\nevents using molecular dynamics with frictional cooling and a Thomas-Fermi\napproximation to the Fermi motion.\n  These events are averaged and propagated in time using the Vlasov approach.\nThe fluctuations are used to evaluate the collision term and in turn the number\nof q-$\\bar q$ created.\n", "  We evaluate the suppression of $J/\\psi$ production in an equilibrating quark\ngluon plasma for two competing mechanisms: Debye screening of colour\ninteraction and dissociation due to energetic gluons. Results are obtained for\n$S+S$ and $Au+Au$ collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. At RHIC energies the\ngluonic dissociation of the charmonium is found to be equally important for\nboth the systems while the screening of the interaction plays a significant\nrole only for the larger systems.\n  At LHC energies the Debye mechanism is found to dominate for both the\nsystems. While considering the suppression of directly produced $\\Upsilon$ at\nLHC energies, we find that only the gluonic dissociation mechanism comes into\nplay for the initial conditions taken from the self screened parton cascade\nmodel in these studies. Thus we find that a systematic study of quarkonium\nsuppression for systems of varying dimensions can help identify the source and\nthe extent of the suppression.\n", "  We analyse a supersymmetric string-inspired model of all fermion masses and\nmixing angles based on the Pati-Salam $SU(4)\\times SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R$\ngauge group supplemented by a $U(1)_X$ flavour symmetry.\n  The model involves third family Yukawa unification and predicts the top mass\nand the ratio of the vacuum expectation values $\\tan \\beta$.\n  The model also provides a successful description of the CKM matrix and\npredicts the masses of the down and strange quarks.\n  However our main focus is on the neutrino masses and MNS mixing angles, and\nwe show how the recent atmospheric neutrino mixing observed by\nSuper-Kamiokande, and the MSW solution to the solar neutrino problem lead to\nimportant information about the flavour structure of the model near the string\nscale.\n  We show how single right-handed neutrino dominance may be implemented by the\nuse of ``Clebsch zeros'', leading to the LMA MSW solution, corresponding to\nbi-maximal mixing. The LOW MSW and SMA MSW solutions are also discussed.\n", "  Evolution equations for multiplicities in QCD cascades can, both in the\nparton and dipole picture, be used to estimate corrections beyond the formal\naccuracy of the modified leading log approximation (MLLA). The differences\nbetween the two pictures, and other uncertainties beyond first order MLLA\ncorrections, are here investigated in some detail. For example, I discuss how\nsome colour suppressed corrections, which cannot be determined without better\nknowledge of non-perturbative QCD, are related to the question of colour\nreconnection. A generalized evolution equation for the dipole cascade is also\npresented.\n", "  The problem of long-range correlations of particles produced in high- energy\ncollisions is discussed. Long-range correlations involve large groups of\nparticles. Among them are, e.g., those correlations which lead to ring-like and\nelliptic flow shapes of individual high-multiplicity events in the\npolar+azimuthal angles plane. The \\w method of \\an which allows to disentangle\nvarious patterns has been proposed and applied to some central lead-lead\ncollisions at energy 158 GeV per nucleon. Previous attempts to find out the\nring-like correlations and recent results on \\w \\an of high- energy nuclei\ninteractions are reviewed.\n", "  We consider the sin(phi) single target-spin asymmetry in deep-inelastic\npi^{+} inclusive electroproduction off a longitudinally polarized target. We\nshow that at larger transverse momentum of the outgoing hadron the evaluated\nasymmetry decreases if one takes into account the first order alpha_S\nperturbative contribution to the cross section, integrated over the azimuthal\nangle. This leads to good agreement with recent HERMES data.\n", "  First a generalized Bell-inequality for different times and for different\nquasi-spin states is developed. We focus on special quasi-spin eigenstates and\ntimes. The inequality based on a local realistic theory is violated by the\nCP-violating parameter, if the quantum theory is used to recalculate the\nprobabilities. Next the quantum mechanical probabilities are modified by the\ndecoherence approach which enables the initial state to factorize\nspontaneously. In this way we get a lower limit for the decoherence parameter\n\\zeta, which measures the degree of decoherence. This result is compared with\nthe experimental value of the decoherence parameter \\zeta deduced from the data\nof the CPLEAR-experiment.\n", "  The logarithmically enhanced alpha^7 ln(1/alpha) contribution to the\nhyperfine splitting of the positronium ground-state energy levels is calculated\nin the framework of dimensionally regularized nonrelativistic quantum\nelectrodynamics. The correction is negative and amounts to about 1/3 of the\nleading logarithmic alpha^7 ln^2(1/alpha) one. The discrepancy between the\nexperimental measurements and the theoretical prediction is reduced.\n", "  The azimuthal single target-spin asymmetries for pi^{+} production in\nsemi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering of leptons off longitudinally\npolarized protons are evaluated using two main approaches available in the\nliterature. It is shown that the approximation where the twist-2 transverse\nquark spin distribution in the longitudinally polarized nucleon is small enough\nto be neglected leads to a consistent description of all existing asymmetries\nobserved by the HERMES experiment.\n", "  In this talk I review the theory of electromagnetic decays of the ground\nstate baryon multiplets with oneheavy quark, calculated using Heavy Hadron\nChiral Perturbation Theory. The M1 and E2 amplitudes for (S^{*}-> S gamma),\n  (S^{*} -> T gamma) and (S -> T gamma)are separately analyzed. All M1\ntransitions are calculated up to O(1/\\Lambda_\\chi^2). The E2 amplitudes\ncontribute at the same order for (S^{*}-> S gamma), while for (S^{*} -> T\ngamma) they first appear at O(1/(m_Q \\Lambda_\\chi^2))and for (S -> T gamma) are\ncompletely negligible. Once the loop contributions is considered, relations\namong different decay amplitudes are derived. Furthermore, one can obtain an\nabsolute prediction for the widths of Xi^{0'(*)}_c-> Xi^{0}_c gamma and\nXi^{-'(*)}_b-> Xi^{-}_b gamma.\n", "  Parity of effects induced by one loop corrections of Standard model of\n  Compton scattering are considered. We note the main effects arise from W\ncontributions. Keeping in the mind scheme independent gauge invariance\namplitude we calculated the one spin asymmetries for the case when initial\nelectron is polarized and the case of circular polarized photon. They are of\norder $10^{-13}$.\n", "  We discuss the quark transversity distribution function and a possible way to\naccess it through the measurement of single spin azimuthal asymmetry in\nsemi-inclusive single pion electroproduction on a transversely polarized\ntarget.\n", "  In order to provide an estimate of eps'/eps several effective theories and\nphysical effects have to be disentangled. In this talk I discuss how it is\npossible to predict eps '/eps taking into account all sources of large logs.\n  The numerical result one obtains, $\\eps '/\\eps \\sim (1.7\\pm 0.6) \\cdot\n10^{-4}$, is in good agreement with present measurements.\n", "  We present an analysis of CPT violation in $B\\to J/\\psi K$ decays. A method\nof kaon regeneration is proposed to increase the $K_{S(L)}$ interference\neffects. With the time evolution of both neutral B and K mesons, we show that\nit is possible to determine the CPT violating parameter in $B^0-\\bar{B^0}$\nmixing or constrain it.\n", "  It has been suggested that the origin of cosmic rays above the GZK limit\nmight be explained by the decay of particles, X, with mass of the order of\n10^{12} GeV. Generation of heavy particles from inflationary quantum\nfluctuations is a prime candidate for the origin of the decaying X particles.\n  It has also been suggested that the problem of non-singular galactic halos\nmight be explained if dark matter originates non-thermally from the decay of\nparticles, Y, such that there is a free-streaming length of the order of\n0.1Mpc. Here we explore the possibility that quantum fluctuations might account\nfor the Y particles as well as the X particles. For the case of non-thermal\nWIMP dark matter with unsuppressed weak interactions we find that there is a\ngeneral problem with deuterium photo-dissociation, disfavouring WIMP dark\nmatter candidates. For the case of more general dark matter particles, which\nmay have little or no interaction with conventional matter, we discuss the\nconditions under which X and Y scalars or fermions can account for non-thermal\ndark matter and cosmic rays. For the case where X and Y scalars are\nsimultaneously produced, we show that galactic halos are likely to have a\ndynamically significant component of X scalar cold dark matter in addition to\nthe dominant non-thermal dark matter component.\n", "  We compute the parton distributions for the chiral quark model. We present a\nnew technique for performing such computations based on Green functions. This\napproach avoids a discretization of the spectrum. It therefore does not need\nany smoothing procedures.\n  The results are similar to those of other groups, however the distributions\npeak at smaller $x$.\n", "  We briefly describe a model for soft diffraction. The model description of\nISR, SppbarS and Tevatron data, and the predictions of the total, elastic,\nsingle and double diffractive cross sections at the LHC can be found in the\noriginal paper. Here we address issues raised at Diffraction 2000, in\nparticular concerning the nature of the resulting Pomeron trajectory.\n", "  We carry out an event generator based study to evaluate the usefulness of the\nthe exclusive signature ``$e^\\pm (\\mu^\\pm) + 2$ bottom jets'' in discovering\nthe Higgs boson at the Tevatron.\n  Using an event generator, we show that with enough luminosity, one should be\nable to detect the Higgs boson up to the mass of about 130 GeV. We consider a\nslightly modified version of the above signature that includes one extra jet.\n  This new signature is more useful because it increases the number of signal\nevents significantly.\n", "  We analyze the possibilities for studying properties of dense QCD-matter,\ncreated in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions, by hard QCD-production\nprocesses, so-called \"hard\" probes -- heavy quarkonia, hard jets, high mass\ndimuons. Special attention is paid to the potential of coming heavy ion\nexperiments on Large Hadron Collider to observe the rescattering and energy\nlosses of hard partons in quark-gluon plasma.\n", "  The factorial moments (FM) of the multiplicity distributions in one- and\ntwo-dimensions are studied in Pb+Pb collisions at 158 AGeV. Obvious\nintermittency slopes are observed in the relation between FM and the partition\nnumber M. The Bose-Einstein correlations (BEC) are investigated in the emulsion\ndata sample. The influences of the two-particle correlation functions (TPCF) on\nthe scaling behavior of FM are also investigated. The dependence of TPCF on the\ninvariant relative momentum Q as well as on the pseudo-rapidity $\\delta\\eta$\nare calculated. It is found that TPCF fulfill the requirements of a power-law\nscaling comparable with the scaling rule of FM. The expected contributions of\nTPCD to FM are quantitatively estimated.\n", "  We study the single production of charged Higgs bosons in e+e- collisions,\nchiefly in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. Our analysis complements\nforegoing studies of the pair production channel especially in regions where\nthe kinematic constraint suppresses pair production. We present cross sections\nrelevant to experiments at the next generation linear colliders and some brief\ndiscussions of their phenomenology. Our analysis shows that the single\nproduction is a useful alternative channel for studying the phenomenology of\ncharged Higgs bosons, and there are regions of parameter space where it is\naccessible beyond the kinematic limit for pair production.\n", "  We show that in very dense quark matter there must exist metastable domain\nwalls where the axial U(1) phase of the color-superconducting condensate\nchanges by 2pi. The decay rate of the domain walls is exponentially suppressed\nand we compute it semiclassically. We give an estimate of the critical chemical\npotential above which our analysis is under theoretical control.\n", "  Combining results on single-particle distributions with those of the\n  Bose-Einstein correlation analysis in the same experiment, the space-time\nemission function is extracted as a function of time and longitudinal\ncoordinate, as well as a function of transverse coordinates.\n  While the former function resembles a boomerang for both types of collision\n(only shifted in the time direction due to the larger freeze-out time in\nheavy-ion collisions), the latter function is Gaussian for heavy-ion\ncollisions, but ring-shaped for hadron-hadron collisions.\n", "  We estimate the size of the twist-3 effects on deeply virtual Compton\nscattering (DVCS) observables, in the Wandzura-Wilczek approximation. We\npresent results in the valence region for the DVCS cross sections, charge\nasymmetries and single spin asymmetries, to twist-3 accuracy.\n", "  We reconsider the old problem of the dynamics of spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking using 3d lattice simulations, and develop a theory of tachyonic\npreheating, which occurs due to the spinodal instability of the scalar field.\nTachyonic preheating is so efficient that symmetry breaking typically completes\nwithin a single oscillation of the field distribution as it rolls towards the\nminimum of its effective potential. As an application of this theory we\nconsider preheating in the hybrid inflation scenario, including SUSY-motivated\nF-term and D-term inflationary models. We show that preheating in hybrid\ninflation is typically tachyonic and the stage of oscillations of a homogeneous\ncomponent of the scalar fields driving inflation ends after a single\noscillation. Our results may also be relevant for the theory of the formation\nof disoriented chiral condensates in heavy ion collisions.\n", "  We point out that hard exclusive production of tensor mesons $f_2(1270)$ with\nhelicity $\\lambda=\\pm 2$ is dominated by the gluon component in the meson wave\nfunction and can be used to determine gluon admixture in tensor mesons in a\ntheoretically clean manner.\n  We present a detailed analysis of the tensor meson distribution amplitudes\nand calculate the transition form factor $\\gamma+\\gamma^*\\to f_2(1270)$ for one\nreal and one virtual photon.\n", "  In these lectures the following topics are considered: historical remarks and\ngeneral properties, Dirac and Majorana neutrino masses, effective lagrangian\napproach, the seesaw mechanism, the number of active left-hauded neutrino\nspecies, the light neutrino mass matrix, the direct measurement of neutrino\nmasses, double beta decay, neutrino oscillations in vacuum and neutrino\noscillations in matter.\n", "  A unified description of spacetime and matter is proposed by using a single\nirreducible representation of SO(10) Super-Poincare algebra(SO(10)SPA). All\n(observed) elementary particles except the graviton are the (massless)\neigenstates of SO10)SPA composed of fundamental Nambu-Goldstone fermions with\nspin 1/2, superons, associating with the spontaneous breakdown of the\nsupertranslation of the spacetime. The systematic investigations of the\nstandard model(SM) and SU(5)GUT by using superon diagrams may reveal the\ngeneration structure, the stability of the proton, K-, B-, D- mixings,\nCP-violation, the atmospheric and solar neutrino deficits and the absence of\nthe electroweak lepton-flavor-mixing. The fundamental action of the\nsuperon-graviton model(SGM) for spacetime and matter is proposed, which is\ninvariant under a new supersymmetry.\n", "  We study CP violation phenomena with the subquark model which is previously\nproposed by us. Our subquark model claims that ``direct'' and ``indirect'' CP\nviolation originate from different sources, which are both belonging to\nsubquark dynamics. We discuss KTeV experiment and CP-asymmetry of\n$(B_{d}\\to{J/{\\psi}K_{s}})$-and $(B_{d}\\to{\\pi}{\\pi})$-decay.\n  This model predicts : the phases of indirect CP violation :\n  ${\\theta}_K={\\theta}_D={\\theta}_{B_s}={\\theta}_{T_c}\\simeq(1/2){\\theta}_{B_d}\n  \\simeq (1/2){\\theta}_{T_u}$.\n", "  The subquark model previously proposed by us showes that the intermediate\n$Z^0$-boson is realized as the composite object and its scalar partner has the\nmass value larger than $Z^0$-boson mass, which is about 110 GeV.\n", "  We discuss the implementations of the Bose-Einstein effect from asymmetric\nsources in Monte Carlo generators. A comparison of LEP data with results from\nthe PYTHIA/JETSET code with the standard procedure imitating the effect and\nwith the results from the weight method\n  (with weights depending in various ways on components of momenta differences)\nis presented. We show that in this last method one can reproduce the\nexperimental hierarchy of the source radii.\n", "  We consider an arbitrary translationally invariant chain model with nearest\nneighbors interaction and satisfying periodic boundary condition.\n  The approach developed here allows a thermodynamic description of the chain\nmodel directly in terms of grand potential per site. This thermodynamic\nfunction is derived from an auxiliary function constructed only from open\nconnected sub-chains. In order to exemplify its application and how this\napproach works we consider the Heisenberg XXZ model. We obtain the coefficients\nof the high temperature expansion of the free energy per site of the model up\nto third order.\n", "  In the framework of the non relativistic quark model, an exhaustive study of\nradiative transitions in mesons is performed. The emphasis is put on several\npoints. Some traditional approximations (long wave length limit, non\nrelativistic phase space, dipole approximation for E1 transitions, gaussian\nwave functions) are analyzed in detail and their effects commented. A complete\ntreatment using three different types of realistic quark-antiquark potential is\nmade. The overall agreement with experimental data is quite good, but some\nimprovements are suggested.\n", "  Many observations suggest that much of the matter of the universe is\nnon-baryonic. Recently, the DAMA NaI dark matter direct detection experiment\nreported an annual modulation in their event rate consistent with a WIMP relic.\nHowever, the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) Ge experiment excludes most of\nthe region preferred by DAMA. We demonstrate that if the dark matter can only\nscatter by making a transition to a slightly heavier state (Delta m ~ 100kev),\nthe experiments are no longer in conflict. Moreover, differences in the energy\nspectrum of nuclear recoil events could distinguish such a scenario from the\nstandard WIMP scenario. Finally, we discuss the sneutrino as a candidate for\ninelastic dark matter in supersymmetric theories.\n", "  We investigate the effects of pion and gluon exchanges on the formation of\ntwo-flavor color superconductivity at moderate density, $\\mu <1 GeV$. The\nchiral quark model proposed by Manohar and Georgi containing pions as well as\ngluons is employed to show that the pion exchange reduces substantially the\nvalue of the superconducting gap gotten with the gluon exchange only. It turns\nout that the pion exchanges produce a repulsion between quark-quark pair in a\nspin and isospin singlet state.\n  We suggest that the phase consisiting of pions, gluons and quarks is one of\nthe candidates of in-medium QCD phase at moderate density.\n", "  By studying the threshold dependence of the excitation curve and the angular\ndistribution in Higgs-strahlung at e+e- colliders, e+e- -> HZ, the spin of the\nHiggs boson in the Standard Model and related extensions can be determined\nunambiguously in a model-independent way.\n", "  We apply a random matrix model to the study of the phase diagram of QCD with\ntwo colors, two flavors, and a small quark mass. Although the effects of\ntemperature are only included schematically, this model reproduces most of the\nground state predictions of chiral perturbation theory and also gives a\nqualitative picture of the phase diagram at all temperatures. It leads,\nhowever, to an unphysical behavior of the chiral order parameter and the baryon\ndensity in vacuum and does not support diquark condensation at arbitrarily high\ndensities. A better treatment of temperature dependence leads to correct vacuum\nand small temperature properties. We compare our results at both high and low\ndensities with the results of microscopic calculations using the\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio model and discuss the effects of large momentum scales on\nthe variations of condensation fields with chemical potential.\n", "  In scenarios with the fundamental unification scale at the TeV one expects\nstring excitations of the standard model fields at accessible energies. We\nstudy the neutrino-nucleon cross section in these models. We show that duality\nof the scattering amplitude forces the existence of a tower of massive\nleptoquarks that mediate the process in the s-channel. Using the narrow-width\napproximation we find a sum rule for the production rate of resonances with\ndifferent spin at each mass level. We show that these contributions can\nincrease substantially the standard model neutrino-nucleon cross section,\nalthough seem insufficient in order to explain the cosmic ray events above the\nGZK cutoff energy.\n", "  We have studied events with a high-x_F antiproton and two central jets with\nE_T>7 GeV in CDF, in p+p_bar collisions at sqrt(s) = 1800 GeV. From the di-jet\nkinematics we derive the diffractive structure function of the antiproton. We\nalso find an excess of events with a rapidity gap at least 3.5 units wide in\nthe proton direction, which we interpret as di-jet production in double pomeron\nexchange events. We find non-factorization between our single diffractive\nresults and (a) diffraction in ep at HERA (b) double pomeron exchange.\n", "  Practically all serious calculations of exclusive particle production in\nultra-relativistic nuclear or hadronic interactions are performed in the\nframework of Gribov-Regge theory or the eikonalized parton model scheme.\n  It is the purpose of this paper to point out serious inconsistencies in the\nabove-mentioned approaches.\n  We will demonstrate that requiring theoretical self-consistency reduces the\nfreedom in modeling high energy nuclear scattering enormously.\n  We will introduce a fully self-consistent formulation of the\nmultiple-scattering scheme in the framework of a Gribov-Regge type effective\ntheory.\n  In addition, we develop new computational techniques which allow for the\nfirst time a satisfactory solution of the problem in the sense that calculation\ns of observable quantities can be done strictly within a self-consistent\nformalism.\n", "  We investigate the status of models containing exotic fermions or extra\nZ-like neutral gauge bosons in the light of the recent data on anomalous\nmagnetic moment of muon. We find that it is possible to extract interesting\nbounds on the parameters characterizing such models. The bounds are\nparticularly strong if the new flavour-changing neutral currents are axial\nvectorlike.\n", "  Using the renormalon calculus, we study the asymptotic behavior of the\nperturbative expansion of the hard-scattering kernels entering the QCD\nfactorization formula for the nonleptonic weak decays B->D M, where M is a\nlight meson. In the ``large-beta_0 limit'', the kernels are infrared finite and\nfree of endpoint singularities to all orders of perturbation theory. The\nleading infrared renormalon singularity corresponding to a power correction of\norder Lambda/m_b vanishes if the light meson has a symmetric light-cone\ndistribution amplitude. We calculate the Borel transforms and the corresponding\nmomentum distribution functions of the hard-scattering kernels, and resum the\nseries of O(beta_0^{n-1} alpha_s^n) corrections to explore the numerical\nsignificance of higher-order perturbative and power corrections. We also derive\nexplicit expressions for the O(beta_0 alpha_s^2) contributions to the kernels,\nand for the renormalon singularities corresponding to power corrections of\norder (Lambda/m_b)^2. Finally, we study the limit m_c->0 relevant to charmless\nhadronic decays such as B->pi pi.\n", "  I discuss recent developments in the QCD cascade formalism. I focus on the\nimportance of and uncertainties in higher order corrections to the Modified\nLeading Log approximation for final-state radiation. I also talk about the CCFM\nand LDC evolution equations for initial-state radiation in DIS.\n", "  We explore the possibility that QCD may undergo a phase transition as a\nfunction of the strange quark mass. This would hint towards models with\n``spontaneous color symmetry breaking'' in the vacuum. For two light quark\nflavors we classify possible colored quark-antiquark, diquark and gluon\ncondensates that are compatible with a spectrum of integer charged states and\nconserved isospin and baryon number. The ``quark mass phase transition'' would\nbe linked to an unusual realization of baryon number in QCD$_2$ and could be\ntested in lattice simulations. We emphasize, however, that at the present stage\nthe Higgs picture of the vacuum cannot predict a quark mass phase transition -\na smooth crossover remains as a realistic alternative. Implications of the\nHiggs picture for the high density phase transition in QCD$_2$ suggest that\nthis transition is characterized by the spontaneous breaking of isospin for\nnuclear and quark matter.\n", "  Double beta decay is indispensable to solve the question of the neutrino mass\nmatrix together with $\\nu$ oscillation experiments. The most sensitive\nexperiment - since eight years the HEIDELBERG-MOSCOW experiment in Gran-Sasso -\nalready now, with the experimental limit of $<m_\\nu > < 0.26$ eV practically\nexcludes degenerate $\\nu$ mass scenarios allowing neutrinos as hot dark matter\nin the universe for the smallangle MSW solution of the solar neutrino problem.\nIt probes cosmological models including hot dark matter already now on the\nlevel of future satellite experiments MAP and PLANCK. It further probes many\ntopics of beyond SM physics at the TeV scale. Future experiments should give\naccess to the multi-TeV range and complement on many ways the search for new\nphysics at future colliders like LHC and NLC. For neutrino physics some of them\n(GENIUS) will allow to test almost all neutrino mass scenarios allowed by the\npresent neutrino oscillation experiments.\n", "  We present in detail a dispersion relation formalism for virtual Compton\nscattering (VCS) off the proton from threshold into the\n$\\Delta(1232)$-resonance region. Such a formalism can be used as a tool to\nextract the generalized polarizabilities of the proton from both unpolarized\nand polarized VCS observables over a larger energy range. We present\ncalculations for existing and forthcoming VCS experiments and demonstrate that\nthe VCS observables in the energy region between pion production threshold and\nthe $\\Delta(1232)$-resonance show an enhanced sensitivity to the generalized\npolarizabilities.\n", "  We investigate the effect of supersymmetric CP violating phases on the\ninclusive decay B\\to X_d\\gamma. Although such a decay contains a large\nbackground from B\\to X_s\\gamma, if isolated it may exhibit sizeable CP\nviolation, both in the Standard Model (SM) and in the context of models beyond\nthe SM. With unconstrained supersymmetric CP violating phases we show that the\ndirect CP asymmetry (A_CP) lies in the region -40%\n  \\le A_CP \\le 40%, where a positive asymmetry would constitute a clear signal\nof physics beyond the SM. Even if a direct measurement of B\\to X_d\\gamma proves\ntoo dif ficult experimentally, its asymmetry contributes non-negligibly to the\nmeasurements of A_CP for B\\to X_s\\gamma, and thus should be included in future\nanalyses. We show t hat there may be both constructive and destructive\ninterference between A^d\\gamma_CP and A^s\\gamma_CP.\n", "  We calculate a correction to the electromagnetic current induced by a heavy\nquark loop. The contribution of this correction to the vacuum polarization\nfunction appears at the O(alpha_s^3) order of perturbation theory and has a\nqualitatively new feature -- its absorptive part starts at zero energy in\ncontrast to other contributions where the absorptive parts start at the\ntwo-particle threshold. Our result imposes a constraint on the order n of the\nmoments used in the heavy-quark sum rules, n<4.\n", "  A Monte Carlo model to simulate nuclear collisions in the energy range going\nfrom SPS to LHC, is presented. The model includes in its initial stage both\nsoft and semihard components, which lead to the formation of color strings.\nCollectivity is taken into account considering the possibility of strings in\ncolor representations higher than triplet or antitriplet, by means of string\nfusion. String breaking leads to the production of secondaries. At this point,\nthe model can be used as initial condition for further evolution by a transport\nmodel. In order to tune the parameters and see the results in nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions, a naif model for rescattering of secondaries is introduced. Results\nof the model are compared with experimental data, and predictions for RHIC and\nLHC are shown.\n", "  The phenomenological implications of the M-theory limit in which\nsupersymmetry is broken by the auxiliary fields of five-brane moduli is\ninvestigated.\n  Assuming that the lightest neutralino provides the dark matter in the\nuniverse, constraints on the sparticle spectrum are obtained. Direct detection\nrates for dark matter are estimated.\n", "  The quantity $\\xi$ introduced recently in the phenomenological description of\nneutrino oscillations is in fact not a free parameter, but a fixed number.\n", "  Lattice QCD predictions have motivated several recent studies of the mixing\nbetween the predicted JPC = 0++ glueball and a qqbar nonet in the 1.3 to 1.7\nGeV region. We show that results from apparently different approaches have some\ncommon features, explain why this is so and abstract general conclusions. We\nplace particular emphasis on the flavour dependent constraints imposed by\ndecays of the f0(1370), f0(1500) and f0(1700) to all pairs of pseudoscalar\nmesons. From these results we identify a systematic correlation between\nglueball mass, mixing, and flavour symmetry breaking and conclude that the\nglueball may be rather lighter than some quenched lattice QCD computations have\nsuggested. We identify experimental tests that can determine the dynamics of a\nglueball in this mass region and discuss quantitatively the feasibility of\ndecoding glueball-qqbar mixing.\n", "  We study the radiative spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking in the extra\ndimensions scenarios of the standard model extension proposed by Antoniadis\n{\\it et al}, Dienes {\\it et al.} and Pomarol {\\it et al.}. In the framework of\nmulti-scale effective theory when viewing from the ultraviolet cutoff scale\ndown to the low energy scale, we find that the effects of Kaluza-Klein\nexcitations of bosons can change the sign of the Higgs mass term of the\nstandard model from positive to negative and therefore trigger the electroweak\nsymmetry breaking at 1.6 (2) TeV or so when the compactification scale is\nassumed to be 0.8 (1.5) TeV or so. New particle contents beyond the SM or\nsupersymmetry are not necessary for this mechanism. We conclude that in the\nextra dimension scenarios, the radiative correction can naturally induce the\ndesired electroweak symmetry breaking.\n", "  By realizing the project of intensive\n  $\\gamma $ beams with large energy (necessary for Photon Colliders) an\nessential flux of light Goldstone particles (LGP - axions, arions, familons,\nmajorons) can be generated. The probability of LGP production is calculated for\ndifferent densities of laser photons in the conversion region (with absorption\nof one or several laser photons). The method for observation of LGP via its\nabsorption in the matter is also presented.\n", "  I discuss how to sample the space of parton momenta in order to best perform\nthe numerical integrations that lead to a calculation of three jet cross\nsections and similar observables in electron-positron annihilation.\n", "  This is the first of a series of three papers treating light baryon\nresonances (up to 3 GeV) within a relativistically covariant quark model based\non the three-fermion Bethe-Salpeter equation with instantaneous two- and\nthree-body forces. In this paper we give a unified description of the\ntheoretical background and demonstrate how to solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation\nby a reduction to the Salpeter equation. The specific new features of our\ncovariant Salpeter model with respect to the usual nonrelativistic quark model\nare discussed in detail. The purely theoretical results obtained in this paper\nwill be applied numerically to explicit quark models for light baryons in two\nsubsequent papers.\n", "  The gluino-induced contribution to the decay $b \\to s \\gamma$ is investigated\nin supersymmetric frameworks with generic sources of flavour violation. It is\nemphasized that the operator basis of the standard model effective Hamiltonian\nis enlarged and that a suitable redefinition allows to realize the usual scheme\nof leading and next-to-leading logarithmic contributions when QCD corrections\nare included. The effects of the leading order\n  QCD corrections on the inclusive branching ratio for $b \\to s \\gamma$ are\nshown. Constraints on supersymmetric sources of flavour violation are derived.\n", "  We introduce the Euler-Lagrange cohomology to study the symplectic and\nmultisymplectic structures and their preserving properties in finite and\ninfinite dimensional Lagrangian systems respectively. We also explore their\ncertain difference discrete counterparts in the relevant regularly discretized\nfinite and infinite dimensional Lagrangian systems by means of the difference\ndiscrete variational principle with the difference being regarded as an entire\ngeometric object and the noncommutative differential calculus on regular\nlattice. In order to show that in all these cases the symplectic and\nmultisymplectic preserving properties do not necessarily depend on the relevant\nEuler-Lagrange equations, the Euler-Lagrange cohomological concepts and content\nin the configuration space are employed.\n", "  Cold dense quark matter is in a crystalline color superconducting phase\nwherever pairing occurs between species of quarks with chemical potentials\nwhose difference \\delta\\mu lies within an appropriate window. If the\ninteraction between quarks is modeled as point-like, this window is rather\nnarrow. We show that when the interaction between quarks is modeled as\nsingle-gluon exchange, the window widens by about a factor of ten at accessible\ndensities and by much larger factors at higher density. This striking\nenhancement reflects the increasingly (1+1)-dimensional nature of the physics\nat weaker and weaker coupling. Our results indicate that crystalline color\nsuperconductivity is a generic feature of the phase diagram of cold dense quark\nmatter, occurring wherever one finds quark matter which is not in the\ncolor-flavor locked phase. If it occurs within the cores of compact stars, a\ncrystalline color superconducting region may provide a new locus for glitch\nphenomena.\n", "  A physical characterization of Landau singularities is emphasized, which\nshould trace the lower boundary N_f^* of the conformal window in QCD and\nsupersymmetric QCD. A natural way to disentangle ``perturbative'' from\n  ``non-perturbative'' contributions below N_f^* is suggested. Assuming an\ninfrared fixed point is present in the perturbative part of the QCD coupling\neven in some range below N_f^* leads to the condition gamma(N_f^*)=1, where\ngamma is the critical exponent. This result is incompatible with the existence\nof an analogue of Seiberg free dual magnetic phase in QCD. Using the Banks-Zaks\nexpansion, one gets\n  4<N_f^*<6. The low value of N_f^* gives some justification to the infrared\nfinite coupling approach to power corrections, and suggests a way to compute\ntheir normalization from perturbative input. If the perturbative series are\nstill asymptotic in the negative coupling region, the presence of a negative\nultraviolet fixed point is required both in QCD and in supersymmetric QCD to\npreserve causality within the conformal window. Some evidence for such a fixed\npoint in QCD is provided through a modified Banks-Zaks expansion. Conformal\nwindow amplitudes, which contain power contributions, are shown to remain\ngenerically finite in the N_f=-\\infty one-loop limit in simple models with\ninfrared finite perturbative coupling.\n", "  We discuss same-sign dilepton production mediated by Majorana neutrinos in\nhigh-energy proton-proton collisions $pp\\ra \\ell^+ \\ell^{\\prime +}X$ for\n$\\ell,~ \\ell^\\prime = e,~ \\mu,~ \\tau$ at the LHC energy $\\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV, and\nin the rare decays of $K$, $D$, $D_s$, and $B$ mesons of the type $M^{+}\\ra\nM^{\\prime -}\\ell ^{+}\\ell ^{\\prime+}$. For the $pp$ reaction, assuming one\nheavy Majorana neutrino of mass $m_N$, we present discovery limits in the\n$(m_{N},|U_{\\ell N}U_{\\ell^\\prime N}|)$ plane where $U_{\\ell N}$ are the mixing\nparameters. Taking into account the present limits from low energy experiments,\nwe show that at LHC for the nominal luminosity L=100 fb$^{-1}$ there is no room\nfor observable same-sign dilepton signals. However, increasing the integrated\nluminosity by a factor 30, one will have sensitivity to heavy Majorana\nneutrinos up to a mass $m_N\\leq 1.5$ TeV only in the dilepton channels $\\mu\\mu$\nand $\\mu \\tau$, but other dilepton states will not be detectable due to the\nalready existing strong constraints. We work out a large number of rare meson\ndecays, both for the light and heavy Majorana neutrino scenarios, and argue\nthat the present experimental bounds on the branching ratios are too weak to\nset reasonable limits on the effective Majorana masses.\n", "  This talk traces the history of RHIC over the last two decades, reviewing the\nscientific motivations underlying its design, and the challenges and\nopportunities the machine presents.\n", "  We consider the single production of charged Higgs bosons $H^\\pm$ of the\ntwo-Higgs-doublet model in $e\\gamma$ collisions through the production\nsubprocess $e^-\\gamma\\to\\nu H^-$.\n  As the production rate is governed by the size of the loop-induced $H^\\pm\nW^\\mp\\gamma$ coupling, the cross section can only be substantial for smaller\nvalues of $\\tan\\beta$, $\\tan\\beta\\lesssim1$, where the top-bottom loop\ncontribution is enhanced.\n  In this case, however, the natural width of the charged Higgs boson becomes\nlarge so that the Standard Model continuum background becomes important. We\nstudy the background subprocess $e^-\\gamma\\to\\nu\\bar t b$ including the\ninterference with the signal, and find that in the region of charged Higgs mass\nthat can be interesting, the signal is difficult to detect.\n", "  We compute the leading logarithms electroweak contributions to gamma gamma to\nf f(bar) processes in SM and MSSM. Several interesting properties are pointed\nout, such as the importance of the angular dependent terms, of the Yukawa\nterms, and especially of the $\\tan^2\\beta$ dependence in the SUSY\ncontributions. These properties are complementary to those found in e+e- to f\nf(bar). These radiative correction effects should be largely observable at\nfuture high energy gamma gamma colliders. Polarized beams would bring\ninteresting checks of the structure of the one loop corrections. We finally\ndiscuss the need for two-loop calculations and resummation.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss physics potential of the Very Long Base-Line (VLBL)\nNeutrino-Oscillation Experiments with the High Intensity Proton Accelerator\n(HIPA), which is planned to be built by 2006 in Tokaimura, Japan.\n  We propose to use conventional narrow-band \\nu_\\mu beams (NBB) from HIPA for\nobserving the \\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_e transition probability and the \\nu_\\mu survival\nprobability.\n  The pulsed NBB allows us to obtain useful information through counting\nexperiments at a huge water-Cherenkov detector which may be placed in our\nneighbor countries.\n  We study sensitivity of such an experiment to the neutrino mass hierarchy,\nthe mass-squared differences, the mixing angles and the CP phase of the 3\\times\n3 lepton flavor mixing matrix (MNS matrix).\n  The CP phase can be measured with a 100kt detector if both the mass-squared\ndifference and U_{e3} elements of the MNS matrix are sufficiently large.\n", "  We show that the broad transverse momentum distribution of the Higgs boson\nproduced by WW fusion can provide a viable way to identify H --> b anti-b\ndecays at the LHC, if particular kinematical configurations with large rapidity\ngaps are selected. We estimate the event rate of the signal and of the QCD b\nanti-b background. We also discuss Higgs boson detection via the H --> tau tau\nand H --> WW* decay modes.\n", "  We calculate the $B\\to\\pi,\\rho$ transition form factors in the framework of\nperturbative QCD to leading power of $1/M_B$, $M_B$ being the $B$ meson mass.\nWe explain the basic principle by discussing the pion electromagnetic form\nfactor. It is shown that the logarithmic and linear singularities occurring at\nsmall momentum fractions of light meson distribution amplitudes do not exist in\na self-consistent perturbative analysis, which includes $k_\\perp$ and threshold\nresummations.\n", "  The $\\gamma p \\to \\gamma \\pi^0 p$ reaction in the $\\Delta(1232)$-resonance\nregion is investigated as a method to access the $\\Delta^+(1232)$ magnetic\ndipole moment. The calculations are performed within the context of an\neffective Lagrangian model containing both the $\\Delta$-resonant mechanism and\na background of non-resonant contributions to the $\\gamma p \\to \\gamma \\pi^0 p$\nreaction. Results are shown both for existing and forthcoming $\\gamma p \\to\n\\gamma \\pi^0 p$ experiments. In particular, the sensitivity of unpolarized\ncross sections and photon asymmetries to the $\\Delta^+$ magnetic dipole moment\nis displayed for those forthcoming data.\n", "  We discuss the possible existence of new long-range forces mediated by spin-1\nor spin-0 particles. They would add their effects to those of gravity, and\ncould lead to apparent violations of the Equivalence Principle. Informations on\nthe (vector and axial) couplings of a new spin-1 U boson may be obtained from\nspontaneously broken gauge invariance. The charge associated with the vector\ncoupling may be expressed as a linear combination of B and L. If the new force\nhas a finite range lambda, its intensity turns out to be proportional to\n1/(lambda^2 F^2), F being the extra U(1) symmetry-breaking scale.\n  Quite surprisingly, particle physics experiments can provide constraints on\nsuch a force, even if the corresponding gauge coupling is extremely small (<<\n10^-19 !). An \"equivalence theorem\" shows that a very light spin-1 U boson with\nnon-vanishing axial couplings does not in general decouple even when its gauge\ncoupling vanishes, but behaves as a quasimassless pseudoscalar. (This\nequivalence theorem is similar to the one of supersymmetry/supergravity\ntheories, according to which a very light spin-3/2 gravitino might get\ndetectable as a quasi massless spin-1/2 goldstino, despite the extreme\nsmallness of Newton's gravitational constant G_N.) Searches for the radiative\nproduction of such U bosons in psi and upsilon decays restrict the extra U(1)\nsymmetry-breaking scale F to be larger than the electroweak scale, providing\nconstraints on the intensity of the corresponding new force.\n", "  A brief review is given of $a_{\\mu}=(g_{\\mu}-2)/2$ as a probe of\nsupersymmetry and of extra dimensions. It is known since the early to mid\nnineteen eightees that the supersymmetric electro-weak correction to $a_{\\mu}$\ncan be as large or larger than the Standard Model electro-weak correction and\nthus any experiment that proposes to test the Standard Model electro-weak\ncorrection will also test the supersymmetric correction and constrain\nsupersymmetric models. The new physics effect seen in the Brookhaven (BNL)\nexperiment is consistent with these early expectations. Detailed analyses\nwithin the well motivated supergravity unified model show that the size of the\nobserved difference ($a_{\\mu}^{exp}-a_{\\mu}^{SM}$) seen at Brookhaven implies\nupper limits on sparticle masses in a mass range accessible to the direct\nobservation of these particles at the Large Hadron Collider. Further, analyses\nalso show that the BNL data is favorable for the detection of supersymmeteric\ndark matter in direct dark matter searches. The effect of large extra\ndimensions on $a_{\\mu}$ is also discussed. It is shown that with the current\nlimits on the size of extra dimensions, which imply that the inverse size of\nsuch dimensions lies in the TeV region, their effects on $a_{\\mu}$ relative to\nthe supersymmetric contribution is small and thus extra dimensions do not\nproduce a serious background to the supersymmetric contribution. It is\nconcluded that the analysis of the additional data currently underway at\nBrookhaven as well as a reduction of the hadronic error will help pin down the\nscale of weak scale supersymmetry even more precisely.\n", "  Replacing the perturbative vacuum by the nonperturbative vacuum, we extend a\nrecent development of a quantum field theoretic framework for scalar and\npseudoscalar meson mixing. The unitary inequivalence of the Fock space of base\n(unmixed) eigenstates and the physical mixed eigenstates is investigated and\nthe flavor vacuum state structure is explicitly found. This is exploited to\ndevelop formulas for two flavor boson oscillations in systems of arbitrary\nboson occupation number. We apply these formulas to analyze the mixing of eta\nwith eta' and comment on the other meson-mixing systems. In addition, we\nconsider the mixing of boson coherent states, which may have future\napplications in the construction of meson lasers.\n", "  Expecting the forthcoming experiment at the upgraded Fermilab Tevatron, we\ncalculated CP-violating polarization asymmetry of t t-bar,\n  A_{CP}= [sigma(p p-bar --> t(-) t-bar(-) X) - sigma(p p-bar --> t(+) t-bar(+)\nX)]/ sigma(p p-bar --> t t-bar X), due to possible anomalous chromomagnetic\n(kappa) and chromoelectric (tilde{kappa}) couplings of the gluon to the top\nquark. Since kappa and tilde{kappa} are sensitive to a contribution from new\nphysics beyond standard model, this observable is useful to search for a signal\nof new physics. It was seen that the magnitude of A_{CP} depends only on\nIm(tilde{kappa) and Im(kappa^* tilde{kappa}). Futhermore, we found that when\n|Im(kappa^* tilde{kappa})|>0.5, one can possibly detect the CP-violation effect\nas a signal of new physics even if the magnitude of Im(tilde{kappa) is zero.\n", "  Precise measurements of the mass and width of the\n  W boson are carried out in e+e- collisions at LEP, by kinematic\nreconstruction of the invariant mass distributions of WW->qqlv and\n  WW->qqqq candidate events. The most recent combination of such results from\nALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL uses approximately 82% of the final LEP2 integrated\nluminosity and is preliminary. The mass of the W boson so determined is\nMw=80.446 +-0.026+-0.030 GeV, while the corresponding direct measurement of the\nW boson width gives\n  Gamma_W= 2.148+-0.071+-0.063 GeV. These measurements are subject to sizeable\nsystematic uncertainties from the QCD phenomena of\n  Bose-Einstein correlations and colour reconnection. Recent substantial\nprogress in both of these areas is reported\n", "  The potential of coming experiments on Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to observe\nthe rescattering and energy loss of heavy quarks in the dense matter created in\nheavy ion collisions is discussed. We analyze the sensitivity of high-mass\nmu+mu- pairs from BBbar semileptonic decays and secondary J/Psi from single B\ndecays to the medium-induced bottom quark energy loss.\n", "  Within low scale theories traditional see-saw and scalar triplet mechanisms,\nfor neutrino mass suppression, do not work out anymore and for realistic model\nbuilding some new ideas are needed. In this paper we suggest mechanism,\ndifferent from existing ones, which provides natural suppression of the\nneutrino masses. The mechanism is realized through extended scalars of 4, 5 or\n6 dimensional $SU(2)_L$ multiplets. Scenario, with fundamental mass scale $M_f$\nin a $\\sim 10^{3}$ TeV range, requires 4-plets guaranteeing neutrino masses\n$\\stackrel{<}{\\sim}1$ eV. For theories with $M_f= few \\cdot 10$ TeV 5-plets\nshould be involved, while in scenarios with $M_f=$ few TeV, 6-plets could be\nefficient.\n  The considered mechanism could be successfully applied also for\nsupersymmetric theories, building scenarios with various values of low $M_f$.\n  Within considered models we also address the question of gauge coupling\nunification. For low scale unification, existence of compact extra dimensions\nturns out to be crucial. Due to additional scalar multiplets, some new examples\nof unification are found for both - non SUSY and SUSY cases. Within non SUSY\nscenarios introduced $SU(2)_L$ scalars take advantage and are important for\nsuccessful unification.\n", "  After 12 years of glorious data taking LEP has been shut down. During the\npast two years an incredible effort has been devoted to get more accurate\npredictions and estimates of the related theoretical uncertainties. Many of the\ntheoretical questions driven by LEP are also relevant at the LC, where\npredictions will be needed with even higher accuracy. This is particularly true\nfor 4-fermion Physics. In this contribution, I review some of the most\nimportant theoretical achievements at LEP in understanding W and Z pair\nproduction, 4-fermion + 1 visible photon signatures and in solving problems\nrelated with gauge invariance. Issues on single W Physics are covered\nelsewhere.\n  Part of the presented work is in progress, the final LEP2 analysis still\nbeing under way.\n", "  We discuss the status of the Gribov-Pontecorvo (GP) solution to the solar\nneutrino problem. This solution naturally appears in bimaximal neutrino mixing\nand reduces the solar and atmospheric neutrino problems to vacuum oscillations\nof three active neutrinos. The GP solution predicts an energy-independent\nsuppression of the solar neutrino flux. It is disfavoured by the rate of the\nHomestake detector, but its statistical significance greatly improves, when the\nchlorine rate and the boron neutrino flux are slightly rescaled, and when the\nSuper-Kamiokande neutrino spectrum is included in the analysis. Our results\nshow that rescaling of the chlorine signal by only 10% is sufficient for the GP\nsolution to exist, if the boron-neutrino flux is taken 10 -- 20% lower than the\nSSM prediction. The regions allowed for the GP solution in the parameter space\nare found and observational signatures of this solution are discussed.\n", "  We compute the nonequilibrium real-time evolution of an O(N)-symmetric scalar\nquantum field theory from a systematic 1/N expansion of the 2PI effective\naction to next-to-leading order, which includes scattering and memory effects.\nIn contrast to the standard 1/N expansion of the 1PI effective action, the\nnext-to-leading order expansion in presence of a possible expectation value for\nthe composite operator leads to a bounded time evolution where the truncation\nerror may be controlled by higher powers in 1/N. We present a detailed\ncomparison with the leading-order results and determine the range of validity\nof standard mean field type approximations.\n  We investigate ``quench'' and ``tsunami'' initial conditions frequently used\nto mimic idealized far-from-equilibrium pion dynamics in the context of\nheavy-ion collisions. For spatially homogeneous initial conditions we find\nthree generic regimes, characterized by an early-time exponential damping, a\nparametrically slow (power-law) behavior at intermediate times, and a late-time\nexponential approach to thermal equilibrium. The different time scales are\nobtained from a numerical solution of the time-reversal invariant equations in\n1+1 dimensions without further approximations. We discuss in detail the\nout-of-equilibrium behavior of the nontrivial n-point correlation functions as\nwell as the evolution of a particle number distribution and inverse slope\nparameter.\n", "  We outline in detail the properties of generalized parton distributions\n(GPDs), which contain new information on the structure of the nucleon and which\nenter the description of hard exclusive reactions. We highlight the physics\ncontent of the GPDs and discuss the quark GPDs in the large $N_c$ limit and\nwithin the context of the chiral quark-soliton model. Guided by this physics,\nwe then present a general parametrization for these GPDs. Subsequently we\ndiscuss how these GPDs enter in a wide variety of hard electroproduction\nprocesses and how they can be accessed from them. We consider in detail deeply\nvirtual Compton scattering and the hard electroproduction of mesons. We\nidentify a list of key observables which are sensitive to the various nucleon\nstructure aspects contained in the GPDs and which can be addressed by present\nand future experiments.\n", "  We compute the order-$\\as$ corrections to the total cross section and to jet\nrates in $\\gamma^* \\gamma^* \\to$ hadrons for the process $\\epem\\to\\epem +$\nhadrons. We use a NLO order general-purpose partonic Monte Carlo event\ngenerator that allows the computation of a rate differential in the produced\nleptons and hadrons. We compare our results with the experimental data for\n$\\epem\\to\\epem +$ hadrons at LEP2.\n", "  It is shown that the ratio of strange to non-strange particle production in\nrelativistic heavy ion collisions is expected to reach a maximum at beam\nenergies around 30 A.GeV in the lab frame. This maximum is unique to heavy ion\ncollisions, and has no equivalent in elementary particle collisions.\n  The appearance of the maximum is due to the energy dependence of the chemical\nfreeze-out parameters and is clearly seen as a pronounced peak in the\nWroblewski factor as a function of the incident energy as well as in the\nbehavior of the K+/pi+ ratio. Below 30 A.GeV strange baryons contribute\nstrongly because of the very large value of the chemical potential muB.\n  As the energy increases, the decrease of the baryon chemical potential\ncoupled with only moderate increases in the associated temperature causes a\ndecline in the relative number of strange baryons above energies of about 30\nA.GeV leading to very pronounced maxima in the Lambda/pi+ and Xi-/pi+ ratios.\n", "  A method using jets is investigated for detecting the Higgs boson at LHC in\nthe mass range about 114 \\GeVc2, suggested by LEP experiments. Higgs bosons are\nproduced in association with a $t \\bar{t}$ pair, and both t and $\\bar{t}$ decay\nsemileptonically to reduce the QCD background. After appropriate cuts, the\nsignal is compared with the main background, $t \\bar{t} + 2$ jets. This\nestimate, using a reasonable approximation for the dominant background $t\\bar\n{t}gg$, suggests a $5.1\\sigma$ effect. This method is seen to be complimentary\nto the two gamma signal. The $t\\bar{t}Z$ channel, with Z decaying to $l^+ l^-$,\nmay be used to reduce theoretical uncertainties in determining the $t \\bar{t}H$\nsignal.\n", "  The evolution of polarized quark distribution functions is taken into account\nthe gluon emission and absorption, quark pair production and annihilation\nprocesses and treated by a statistical method which provides quark distribution\nfunctions at small $Q^2$. The evolution function of quark distributions is\nderived and solved by numerical methods. Then the $Q^2$ dependent and\n$\\alpha_{s}$ dependent structure functions $F_{2}(x, Q^{2})$ are obtained and\nthe example of it, the proton structure function, is calculated, whose increase\nand decrease tendency with $\\alpha_{s}$ at different $x$ is consistent with\nexperiments. This is also an evidence that the statistical methods for the\nnucleon is reasonable.\n", "  New experimental data from HERA explore the region of very small x and small\nand moderate $Q^2$. We study the role of unitarity corrections in the\ndescription of these data. For that, we propose a model separating the small\nand large components of the $q\\bar q$ fluctuation. This model gives a unified\ndescription of total and diffractive production in $\\gamma^*p$ interactions. In\nthis model unitarity corrections are controlled by diffraction data.\n", "  We perform a detailed study of the Earth matter effects on supernova\nneutrinos. The dependences of these effects on the properties of the original\nneutrino fluxes, on the trajectory of the neutrinos inside the Earth and on the\noscillation parameters are described. We show that, for a large fraction (60 %)\nof the possible arrival times of the signal, the neutrino flux crosses a\nsubstantial amount of the matter of the Earth at least for one of the existing\ndetectors. For oscillation parameters from the LMA solution of the solar\nneutrino problem the Earth matter effect consists in an oscillatory modulation\nof the $\\barnue$ and/or $\\nu_e$ energy spectra. The relative deviation with\nrespect to the undistorted spectra can be as large as 20-30 % for E> 20 MeV and\n70-100 % for E> 40 MeV. For parameters from the\n  SMA and LOW solutions the effect is localized at low energies (E<10 MeV) and\nis not larger than 10 %. The Earth matter effects can be revealed (i) by the\nobservation of oscillatory distortions of the energy spectra in a single\nexperiment and (ii) by the comparison between the spectra at different\ndetectors. For a supernova at distance D=10 Kpc, comparing the results of\nSuperKamiokande (SK), SNO and LVD experiments one can establish the effect at\n(2-3) \\sigma level, whereas larger statistical significance ((4-5) \\sigma) is\nobtained if two experiments of SK-size or larger are available. Studies of the\nEarth matter effect will select or confirm the solution of the solar neutrino\nproblem, probe the mixing U_{e 3} and identify the hierarchy of the neutrino\nmass spectrum.\n", "  The Lund Area Law describes the probability for the production of a set of\ncolourless hadrons from an initial set of partons, in the Lund string\nfragmentation model. In this paper we will present a general method to\nimplement the Area Law for a multi-gluon string state. The partonic states are\nin general given by a perturbative QCD cascade and are consequently defined\nonly down to a cutoff in the energy momentum fluctuations. We will show that\nour method defines the states down to the hadronic mass scale inside an\nanalytically calculable scenario.\n  We will then show that there is a differential version of our process which\nis closely related to the generalised rapidity range \\lambda, which has been\nused as a measure on the partonic states. We identify \\lambda as the area\nspanned between the directrix curve (the curve given by the parton energy\nmomentum vectors laid out in colour order, which determines the string surface)\nand the average curve (to be called the P-curve) of the stochastic X-curves\n(curves obtained when the hadronic energy-momentum vectors are laid out in rank\norder). Finally we show that from the X-curve corresponding to a particular\nstochastic fragmentation situation it is possible to reproduce the directrix\ncurve (up to one starting vector and a set of sign choices, one for each\nhadron).\n", "  We consider propagation of heavy quarks in QCD matter. Because of large quark\nmass, the radiative quark energy loss appears to be qualitatively different\nfrom that of light quarks at all energies of practical importance. Finite quark\nmass effects lead to an in-medium enhancement of the heavy-to-light D/\\pi ratio\nat moderately large (5--10 GeV) transverse momenta. For hot QCD matter a large\nenhancement is expected, whose magnitude and shape are exponentially sensitive\nto the density of colour charges in the medium.\n", "  I review theoretical and experimental challenges in studies of the ratio of\nmultiplicities in quark and gluon jets, and its relevance for our understanding\nof hadronization.\n", "  The interpretation of experimental results at RHIC and in the future also at\nLHC requires very reliable and realistic models.\n  Considerable effort has been devoted to the development of such models during\nthe past decade, many of them being heavily used in order to analyze data.\n  It is the purpose of this paper to point out serious inconsistencies in the\nabove-mentioned approaches.\n  We will demonstrate that requiring theoretical self-consistency reduces the\nfreedom in modeling high energy nuclear scattering enormously.\n  We will introduce a fully self-consistent formulation of the\nmultiple-scattering scheme in the framework of a Gribov-Regge type effective\ntheory.\n  In addition, we develop new computational techniques which allow for the\nfirst time a satisfactory solution of the problem in the sense that\ncalculations of observable quantities can be done strictly within a\nself-consistent formalism.\n", "  This work addresses more to the technical rather than to the physical\nproblem, how to calculate analytically the form factor $F(Q)$, the associated\nmean-square radius $<r^2>$, and the distribution function $\\Phi(x,Q^2)$ for a\ngiven light-cone wave function $\\Psi_{q\\bar q}(x,\\vec k_{\\perp})$ of the pion.\nThey turn out to be functions of only one dimensionless parameter, which is the\nratio of the constituent quark mass and an effective Bohr momentum which\nmeasures the width of the wave function in momentum space. Both parameters are\nsubject to change in the future, when the presently used solution for the over\nsimplified $\\uparrow\\downarrow$-model will be replaced by something better.\nTheir relation to and agreement with experiment is discussed in detail.\n  The procedure can be generalized also to other hadrons.\n", "  It is well known that the Zee model induces small neutrino masses by\nradiative corrections, where the bi-maximal flavor mixing is possible. We\nanalyze the cosmological condition in order for the baryon asymmetry generated\nin the early universe not to be washed out in the\n  Zee model. Since the lepton number is violated explicitly in the Zee model,\nthe baryon asymmetry might be washed out through the sphaleron processes\ntogether with the lepton-number violating interactions. In this letter, we will\nshow that the baryon asymmetry is {\\it not} washed out, although it has been\nsaid that the Zee model cannot preserve the baryon asymmetry generated in the\nearly universe. This can be seen by considering an approximately conserved\nnumber, $L' \\equiv\n  L_e-L_\\mu-L_\\tau$.\n", "  We obtain a generic closed system of equations on a brane that describes its\ninner evolution and give a method for extending solutions on the brane to the\nbulk. We also discuss the cosmological implications of the closed system of\nequations obtained. We consider bulk spaces with both spacelike and timelike\nextra dimension, with and without the $Z_2$ symmetry of reflection relative to\nthe brane.\n", "  We calculate a single transverse-spin asymmetry for the Drell-Yan\nlepton-pair's angular distribution in perturbative QCD. At leading order in the\nstrong coupling constant, the asymmetry is expressed in terms of a twist-3\nquark-gluon correlation function T_F^{(V)}(x_1,x_2). In our calculation, the\nsame result was obtained in both light-cone and covariant gauge in QCD, while\nkeeping explicit electromagnetic current conservation for the virtual photon\nthat decays into the lepton pair. We also present a numerical estimate of the\nasymmetry and compare the result to an existing other prediction.\n", "  In the early universe or in some regions of supernovae, the neutrino\nrefractive index is dominated by the neutrinos themselves. Several previous\nstudies have found numerically that these self-interactions have the effect of\ncoupling different neutrino modes in such a way as to synchronize the flavor\noscillations which otherwise would depend on the energy of a given mode. We\nprovide a simple explanation for this baffling phenomenon in analogy to a\nsystem of magnetic dipoles which are coupled by their self-interactions to form\none large magnetic dipole which then precesses coherently in a weak external\nmagnetic field. In this picture the synchronized neutrino oscillations are\nperfectly analogous to the weak-field Zeeman effect in atoms.\n", "  The electron, which has been pictured as an elementary particle ever since\nJ.J. Thomson's e/m-measurement in 1897, and the relativistic motion of which is\ndescribed by the Dirac equation, is discussed in the light of the recent\nprogress made in Science of Complex Systems. Theoretical arguments and\nexperimental evidences are presented which show that such an electron exhibits\ncharacteristic properties of spatiotemporal complexities due to Self-Organized\nCriticality (SOC). This implies in particular that, conceptually and logically,\nit is neither possible nor meaningful to identify such an object with an\nordinary particle, which by definition is something that has a fixed mass\n(size), a fixed lifetime, and a fixed structure.\n", "  We show that the spin asymmetry in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering\nbetween a longitudinally polarized lepton beam and a transversely polarized\nproton target is sensitive to the proton transversity function. The asymmetry,\nwhich is twist 3, is estimated to be more than 10% under the most favourable\nconditions. The experiment we suggest is feasible at facilities like DESY, CERN\nand JLAB.\n", "  The mechanism of chiral symmetry restoration in the context of the Georgi\nVector Limit (GVL) at finite temperature/density is discussed.\n  It is suggested that, whereas the system may be driven to the GVL, the fact\nof reaching the point of restoration does not neceserily mean the complete\nrealization of the GVL since the other mechanisms of restoration may contribute\nat lower temperatures/densities.\n", "  The quantum dynamics of the symmetry broken lambda (Phi^2)^2 scalar field\ntheory in the presence of an homogeneous external field is investigated in the\nlarge N limit. We choose as initial state the ground state for a constant\nexternal field J .The sign of the external field is suddenly flipped from\n  J to - J at a given time and the subsequent quantum dynamics calculated.\nSpinodal instabilities and parametric resonances produce large quantum\nfluctuations in the field components transverse to the external field. This\nallows the order parameter to turn around the maximum of the potential for\nintermediate times. Subsequently, the order parameter starts to oscillate near\nthe global minimum for external field - J, entering a novel quasi-periodic\nregime.\n", "  We derive the first terms in the amplitude of lepton pair production in the\nCoulomb fields of two relativistic heavy ions. Using the Sudakov technique,\nwhich very simplify the calculations in momentum space for the processes at\nhigh energies, we get the compact analytical expressions for differential cross\nsection of the process under consideration in the lowest order in fine\nstructure constant (Born approximation) valid for any momentum transfer and in\na wide kinematics region for produced particles. Exploiting the same technique\nwe consider the next terms of perturbation series (up to fourth order in fine\nstructure constant) and investigate their energy dependence and limiting cases.\nIt has been shown that taking in account all relevant terms in corresponding\norder one obtains the expressions which are gauge invariant and finite. We\nestimate the contribution of the Coulomb corrections to the total cross section\nand discuss the cancellations of the different terms which holds in the total\ncross section.\n", "  The perturbative approach to the description of long wavelength excitations\nat high temperature breaks down near the critical point of a second order phase\ntransition. We study the \\emph{dynamics} of these excitations in a relativistic\nscalar field theory at and near the critical point via a renormalization group\napproach at high temperature and an $\\epsilon$ expansion in $d=5-\\epsilon$\nspace-time dimensions. The long wavelength physics is determined by a\nnon-trivial fixed point of the renormalization group. At the critical point we\nfind that the dispersion relation and width of quasiparticles of momentum $p$\nis $\\omega_p \\sim p^{z}$ and $\\Gamma_p \\sim (z-1) \\omega_p$ respectively, the\ngroup velocity of quasiparticles $v_g \\sim p^{z-1}$ vanishes in the long\nwavelength limit at the critical point. Away from the critical point for\n$T\\gtrsim T_c$ we find $\\omega_p \\sim \\xi^{-z}[1+(p \\xi)^{2z}]^{{1/2}}$ and\n$\\Gamma_p \\sim (z-1) \\omega_p \\frac{(p \\xi)^{2z}}{1+(p \\xi)^{2z}}$ with $\\xi$\nthe finite temperature correlation length $ \\xi \\propto |T-T_c|^{-\\nu}$. The\nnew \\emph{dynamical} exponent $z$ results from anisotropic renormalization in\nthe spatial and time directions. For a theory with O(N) symmetry we find $z=1+\n\\epsilon \\frac{N+2}{(N+8)^2}+\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^2)$. Critical slowing down,\ni.e, a vanishing width in the long-wavelength limit, and the validity of the\nquasiparticle picture emerge naturally from this analysis.\n", "  The potential of B-physics in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is\ndiscussed. The different mechanisms of heavy quark production at high energies\nare considered. We analyze the sensitivity of high-mass mu+mu- pairs from BBbar\nsemileptonic decays and secondary J/Psi's from single B decays to the\nmedium-induced bottom quark energy loss at LHC energies.\n", "  A nonperturbative approach to QCD describing confinement and chiral symmetry\nbreaking is discussed. It is based on the path integral representation of\nGreen's function of quarks and leads to the QCD string theory. The effective\nactions for mesons and baryons in the external uniform static electromagnetic\nfields are obtained. The area law of the Wilson loop integral, the\napproximation of the Nambu-Goto straight-line string, and the asymmetric\nquark-diquark structure of nucleons are used to simplify the problem. The\nspin-orbit and spin-spin interactions of quarks are treated as a perturbation.\nUsing the virial theorem we estimate the mean radii of hadrons in terms of the\nstring tension and the Airy function zeros. On the basis of the perturbation\ntheory in small external electromagnetic fields we derive the electromagnetic\npolarizabilities of nucleons. The electric and diamagnetic polarizabilities of\na proton are $\\bar{\\alpha}_p= 10\\times 10^{-4} fm^3$, $\\beta_p^{dia}=-8\\times\n10^{-4} fm^3$ and for a neutron we find $\\bar{\\alpha}_n=4.2\\times 10^{-4} fm^3\n$, $\\beta_n^{dia}= -5.4\\times 10^{-4} fm^3$. Using the $\\Delta$ contribution to\nthe paramagnetic polarizability of the nucleons, reasonable values of the\nmagnetic polarizabilities $\\bar{\\beta}_p=(5\\pm 3)\\times 10^{-4} fm^3$,\n$\\bar{\\beta}_n=(7.6\\pm 3)\\times 10^{-4} fm^3$ are estimated.\n", "  After some historic remarks and a brief summary of recent theoretical news\nabout the QCD phases, we turn to the issue of $freeze-out$ in heavy ion\ncollisions. We argue that the chemical freeze-out line should actually consists\nof two crossing lines of different nature. We also consider some inelatic\nreactions which occure $after$ chemical freeze-out, emphasizing the role of\noverpopulation of pions. The $hydrodynamics$ (with or without hadronic\nafterburner) explaines SPS/RHIC data on radial and elliptic flow in unexpected\ndetails,for different particles, collision energies, and impact parameters.\n  Apart of Equation of State (EoS), it has basically no free parameters. The\nEoS which describe these data best agrees quite well with the lattice\npredictions, with the QGP latent heat $\\Delta\\epsilon\\approx 800 Mev/fm^3$.\nOther phenomena at RHIC, such as ``jet quenching'' and huge ellipticity at\nlarge $p_t$, also point toward very rapid entropy production. Its mechanism\nremains an outstanding open problem: at the end we discuss recent application\nof the instanton/sphaleron mechanism. The gg collisions with $\\sqrt{s}=2-3 GeV$\nmay result not in mini-jets but rather in production of sphaleron-like\ngluomagnetic clusters, which are classically unstable and promptly decay into\nseveral gluons and quarks, in sperical mini-Bangs.\n", "  The drastic rise of the proton structure function $F_2(x,Q^2)$ when the\nBj\\\"orken variable $x$ decreases, seen at HERA for a large span of $Q^2$, may\nbe damped when $x\\to 0$ and $Q^2$ increases beyond $\\sim$ several hundreds \\g2.\nThis phenomenon observed in the Regge type models is discussed in terms of the\neffective Pomeron intercept and of the derivative $B_x=\\partial{\\ell n\nF_2(x,Q^2)}/\\partial{\\ell n(1/x)}$. The method of the overlapping bins is used\nto extract the derivatives $B_x$ and $B_Q=\\partial{\\ell n\nF_2(x,Q^2)}/\\partial{Q^2}$ from the data on $F_2$ for $6.0\\cdot 10^{-5}\\le x\\le\n0.61$ and $1.2 \\le Q^2$ (\\g2) $\\le 5000$. It is shown that the extracted\nderivatives are well described by recent Regge models with the Pomeron\nintercept equal one.\n", "  The modifications induced in the calculation of the cross section of the\ndiffractive process gamma gamma -> J/Psi J/Psi when the gluon propagator is\nchanged are analyzed. Instead of the usual perturbative gluon propagator,\nalternative forms obtained using non-perturbative methods like Dyson-Schwinger\nequations are used to consider in a more consistent way the contributions of\nthe infrared region. The result shows a reduction in the differential\ncross-section for low momentum transfer once compared with the perturbative\nresult, to be confirmed with future experimental results from TESLA.\n", "  We use the POMWIG Monte Carlo generator to predict the cross-sections for\ndouble diffractive higgs and di-photon production at the Tevatron and LHC. We\nfind that the higgs production cross-section is too small to be observable at\nTevatron energies, and even at the LHC observation would be difficult. Double\ndiffractive di-photon production, however, should be observable within one year\nof Tevatron Run II.\n", "  We discuss several methods which can be used to distinguish the graviton\nresonances of the Randall-Sundrum model from the graviton-like resonances which\nmay occur in other theories. The Breit-Wigner line shape of the RS graviton is\nfound to be particularly useful. In particular we show that the \"effective\"\ngraviton resonance present in the model of Dvali et al ~can be distinguished\nfrom those of the Randall-Sundrum scenario for a reasonably wide range of model\nparameters.\n", "  We study the muon magnetic dipole moment and the Higgs mass in the framework\nof the supersymmetric SU(5) models. In this analysis, all the relevant\nparameters in the Lagrangian are taken to be free; in particular, assumption of\nthe universal scalar mass is not adopted. Negative search for the Higgs boson\nat the LEP II experiment sets an important constraint on the supersymmetric\ncontribution to the muon magnetic dipole moment a_\\mu(SUSY). It is shown that,\nfor a fixed value of the lightest Higgs mass, the maximum possible value of\na_\\mu(SUSY) becomes significantly larger in the general SU(5) case compared to\nthe case of the universal scalar mass (i.e., the case of the so-called\n``CMSSM''). We also point out that, if we take relatively large value of the\ntrilinear scalar couplings, the constraint from the Higgs mass is drastically\nrelaxed. In this case, a_\\mu(SUSY) can be as large as \\sim 50\\times 10^{-10}\neven for small value of \\tan\\beta (say, for \\tan\\beta=5).\n", "  We explore the allowed ranges of cross sections for the elastic scattering of\nneutralinos \\chi on nucleons in the constrained minimal supersymmetric\nextension of the Standard Model (CMSSM), in which scalar and gaugino masses are\neach assumed to be universal at some input grand unification scale. We extend\nprevious calculations to larger \\tan \\beta and investigate the limits imposed\nby the recent LEP lower limit on the mass of the Higgs boson and by b \\to s\n\\gamma, and those suggested by g_\\mu - 2. The Higgs limit and b \\to s \\gamma\nprovide upper limits on the cross section, particularly at small and large \\tan\n\\beta, respectively, and the value of g_\\mu - 2 suggests a lower limit on the\ncross section for \\mu > 0. The spin-independent nucleon cross section is\nrestricted to the range 6 \\times 10^{-8} pb > \\sigma_{SI} > 2 \\times 10^{-10}\npb for \\mu > 0, and the spin-dependent nucleon cross section to the range\n10^{-5} pb > \\sigma_{SD} > 2 \\times 10^{-7} pb. Lower values are allowed if \\mu\n<0.\n", "  We apply QCD Finite Energy Sum Rules to the scalar-isoscalar current to\ndetermine the lightest $u \\bar{u} + d \\bar{d}$ meson in this channel. We use\n`pinch-weights' to improve the reliability of the QCD predictions and reduce\nthe sensitivity to the cut-off $s_0$. A decaying exponential is included in the\nweight function to allow us to focus on the contribution from low mass states\nto the phenomenological integral. On the theoretical side we include OPE\ncontributions up to dimension six and a contribution due to instantons taken\nfrom the Instanton Liquid Model. Phenomenologically, we incorporate\nexperimental data by using a coupling scheme for the scalar current which links\nthe vacuum polarisation to the $\\pi \\pi$ scattering amplitude via the scalar\nform factor. We find that the sum rules are well saturated for certain\ninstanton parameters. We conclude that the $f_0(400-1200)$ definitely contains\na large $u \\bar{u} + d \\bar{d}$ component, whereas the $f_0(980)$ most likely\ndoes not. We are able to estimate the average light quark mass and find $m_q(1\n\\GeV) = 5.2 \\pm 0.6$ MeV.\n", "  Using a simple quark-diquark model, we extract a set of unpolarized and\npolarized fragmentation functions for the $\\Lambda$ based on the available\nunpolarized $\\Lambda$ production data in $e^+ e ^- $ annihilation. It is found\nthat there is a strong SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking in the unpolarized\n$\\Lambda$ fragmentation functions and that the polarized $u$ and $d$ quark\ncontributions to the polarized $\\Lambda$ fragmentation are positive in medium\nand large $z$ region. The predictions of $\\Lambda$-polarization with the\nobtained quark fragmentation functions are compatible with the available data\non the longitudinally polarized $\\Lambda$ produced in $e^+e^-$-annihilation,\npolarized charged lepton deep inelastic scattering (DIS), and neutrino DIS. The\nspin asymmetry for the $\\Lambda$ production in $p\\vec{p}$ collisions is also\npredicted for a future test in experiments at RHIC-BNL.\n", "  We study inclusive heavy quark and exclusive heavy quark pair production in\npp, pA and AA interactions. Intrinsic transverse momentum is introduced in pp\ninteractions. Nuclear effects, limited to $k_T$ broadening and nuclear\nshadowing, are introduced in pA and AA interactions. The nuclear dependence is\nstudied over a range of energies, both in fixed target and collider setups.\n", "  We analyse a simple RPV extension of the MSSM, with bilinear\n  R-parity violation in the soft terms and vevs, but not between the terms in\nthe superpotential. The model gives two massive neutrinos, and can fit all\nconstraints from neutrino data. We show analytically how to compute the lepton\nnumber violating Lagrangian parameters from neutrino masses and mixing angles.\nConversely, we numerically vary the bilinear couplings as input parameters to\ndetermine the allowed ranges that are consistent with neutrino data. We briefly\ncomment on the implications of our bounds for low energy LFV processes.\n", "  The electric field corrections to the recently measured muon magnetic moment\ng-2 anomaly are considered from both the classical (BMT) and the quantum\nmechanical (Dirac) viewpoints. In both views, we prove that the electric field\ninducing the horizontal betatron tune does not renormalize the anomaly\nfrequency. With this result kept in mind, the experimental muon magnetic moment\nanomaly is in closer agreement with standard model predictions than has been\npreviously reported.\n", "  We study supergravity inflationary models where inflation is produced along\nthe angular direction. For this we express the scalar component of a chiral\nsuperfield in terms of the radial and the angular components. We then express\nthe supergravity potential in a form particularly simple for calculations\ninvolving polynomial expressions for the superpotential and Kahler potential.\nWe show for a simple Polonyi model the angular direction may give rise to a\nstage of inflation when the radial field is fixed to its minimum. We obtain\nanalytical expressions for all the relevant inflationary quantities and discuss\nthe possibility of supersymmetry breaking in the radial direction while\ninflating by the angular component.\n", "  We correct the error in the sign of the pseudoscalar pole contribution to the\nmuon g-2, which dominates the O(alpha^3) hadronic light-by-light scattering\neffect. The error originates from our oversight of a feature of the algebraic\nmanipulation program FORM which defines the epsilon-tensor in such a way that\nit satisfies the relation epsilon_{mu_1 mu_2 mu_3 mu_4} epsilon_{nu_1 nu_2 nu_3\nnu_4} eta^{mu_1 nu_1} eta^{mu_2 nu_2} eta^{mu_3 nu_3} eta^{mu_4 nu_4} = 24,\nirrespective of space-time metric. To circumvent this problem, we replaced the\nproduct epsilon_{mu_1 mu_2 mu_3 mu_4} epsilon_{nu_1 nu_2 nu_3 nu_4} by -\neta_{mu_1 nu_1} eta_{mu_2 nu_2} eta_{mu_3 nu_3} eta_{mu_4 nu_4} \\pm cdots in\nthe FORM-formatted program, and obtained a positive value for the pseudoscalar\npole contribution, in agreement with the recent result obtained by Knecht {\\it\net al}.\n", "  We analyze the azimuthal anisotropy of jet spectra due to energy loss of hard\npartons in quark-gluon plasma, created initially in nuclear overlap zone in\ncollisions with non-zero impact parameter. The calculations are performed for\nsemi-central Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energy.\n", "  In these remarks I explain the motivation which leads us to consider chemical\nnonequilibrium processes in flavor equilibration and in statistical\nhadroniziation of quark--gluon plasma (QGP). Statistical hadronization allowing\nfor chemical non-equilibrium is introduced. The reesults of fits to\n  RHIC-130 results, including multistrange hadrons, are shown to agree only\nwith the model of an exploding QGP fireball.\n", "  Investigating leptonic decays of pi^-, K^-, B^-, pi^0, K_L^0, B_s^0 we\npresent new bounds on some products of two R-parity violating coupling\nconstants. For mesons of a similar structure but so far poor experimental data\nwe give the corresponding formulae, to be used in the future.\n", "  We investigate the lepton flavor violation in the framework of the MSSM with\nright-handed neutrinos taking the large mixing angle MSW solution in the\nquasi-degenerate and the inverse-hierarchical neutrino masses. We predict the\nbranching ratio of $\\mu \\to e+\\gamma$ and $\\tau \\to \\mu+\\gamma$ processes\nassuming the degenerate right-handed Majorana neutrino masses. We find that the\nbranching ratio in the quasi-degenerate neutrino mass spectrum is 100 times\nsmaller than the ones in the inverse-hierarchical and the hierarchical neutrino\nspectra. We emphasize that the magnitude of $U_{e3}$ is one of important\ningredients to predict BR($\\mu \\to e +\\gamma $). The effect of the deviation\nfrom the complete-degenerate right-handed Majorana neutrino masses are also\nestimated. Furtheremore, we examine the $S_{3\\sL}\\times S_{3\\sR}$ model, which\ngives the quasi-degenerate neutrino masses, and the Shafi-Tavartkiladze model,\nwhich gives the inverse-hierarchical neutrino masses. Both predicted branching\nratios of $\\mu\\to e+\\gamma$ are smaller than the experimantal bound.\n", "  Positivity constraints are derived for the generalized parton distributions\n(GPDs) of spin-1/2 hadrons. The analysis covers the full set of eight twist-2\nGPDs. Several new inequalities are obtained which constrain GPDs by various\ncombinations of usual (forward) unpolarized and polarized parton distributions\nincluding the transversity distribution.\n", "  Evolution of structure functions and their moments at low and moderate $Q^2$\nis studied in the chiral field theory. Evolution equations based on\nperturbation expansion in the coupling constant of the effective theory are\nderived and solved for the moments. The kernels of evolution arising from\ndifferent processes have been calculated with contributions from direct and\ncross channels, the interference terms being non-negligible in the kinematic\nregions under consideration. This is shown to lead to flavor-dependence of the\nkernels which manifests in observable effects. The invalidity of the\nprobabilistic approach to the evolution process is also pointed out.\n", "  We consider the double-spin cos(phi) asymmetry for pion electroproduction in\nsemi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering of longitudinally polarized leptons\noff longitudinally polarized protons. We estimate the size of the asymmetry in\nthe approximation where all twist-3 interaction-dependent distribution and\nfragmentation functions are set to zero. In that approximation at HERMES\nkinematics a sizable negative cos(phi) double-spin asymmetry for pi+\nelectroproduction is predicted.\n", "  The leading and sub-leading order results for pion electroproduction in\npolarized and unpolarized semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering, are\nconsidered putting emphasis on transverse momentum dependent effects appearing\nin azimuthal asymmetries. In particular the spin-dependent (single, double) and\nspin-independent asymmetries of the distributions in the azimuthal angle of the\npion related to the lepton scattering plane are discussed.\n", "  The three-dimensional abelian Higgs model has been argued to be dual to a\nscalar field theory with a global U(1) symmetry. We show that this duality,\ntogether with the scaling and universality hypotheses, implies a scaling law\nfor the magnetic permeablity chi_m near the line of second order phase\ntransition: chi_m ~ t^nu, where t is the deviation from the critical line and\nnu ~ 0.67 is a critical exponent of the O(2) universality class. We also show\nthat exactly on the critical lines, the dependence of magnetic induction on\nexternal magnetic field is quadratic, with a proportionality coefficient\ndepending only on the gauge coupling. These predictions provide a way for\ntesting the duality conjecture on the lattice in the Coulomb phase and at the\nphase transion.\n", "  We present a modification of our previous family replicated gauge group\nmodel, which now generates the Large Mixing Angle MSW solution rather than the\nexperimentally disfavoured Small Mixing Angle MSW solution to the solar\nneutrino oscillation problem. The model is based on each family of quarks and\nleptons having its own set of gauge fields, each containing a replica of the\nStandard Model gauge fields plus a (B-L)-coupled gauge field. By a careful\nchoice of the Higgs field gauge quantum numbers, we avoid our previous\nprediction that the solar neutrino mixing angle is equal order of magnitudewise\nto the Cabibbo angle, replacing it and the well-known Fritzsch relation with\nthe relation \\theta_{c}\\sim (\\theta_{\\odot})^{-1/3} (m_d/m_s)^{2/3}. At the\nsame time we retain a phenomenologically successful structure for the charged\nquark and lepton mass matrices. A fit of all the seventeen quark-lepton mass\nand mixing angle observables, using just six new Higgs field vacuum expectation\nvalues, agrees with the experimental data within the theoretically expected\nuncertainty of about 64%, i.e. it fits perfectly order of magnitudewise.\n", "  First I review some previous work on the lightest scalars below 1.5 GeV, and\nhow these scalars can be understood as unitarized nonet states. The bare\nscalars are strongly distorted by hadronic mass shifts, and the lightest I=0\nstate becomes a very broad resonance of mass and width of about 500 MeV.\n  This is the sigma meson required by models based on linear realization of\nchiral symmetry. Recently the light sigma has clearly been observed in D decay\nto 3 pions by the E791 experiment at Fermilab and I discuss how this decay\nchannel can be predicted in a Constituent Quark Meson Model, which incorporates\nheavy quark and chiral symmetries.\n  At the end I discuss the likely possibility that there are in fact two light\nscalar nonets, such as one mainly meson-meson (or 4-quark) nonet and one qq bar\nnonet. I point out that an interesting approximate description of this could be\nmodelled by starting with two coupled linear sigma models. After gauging the\noverall symmetry one of these could be looked upon as the \"Higgs sector of\nstrong interactions\", and the lightest scalar nonet becomes the corresponding\nHiggs nonet.\n", "  An effective texture is presented for six Majorana neutrinos, three active\nand three (conventional) sterile, based on a 6x6 mass matrix whose 3x3 Dirac\ncomponent (i.e., active--sterile component) is conjectured to get a\nhierarchical fermion universal form, similar to the previously constructed 3x3\nmass matrices for charged leptons as well as for up and down quarks. However,\nfor neutrinos this form becomes unitarily deformed by the action of bimaximal\nmixing, specific in their case. The 3x3 lefthanded and righthanded components\n(i.e., active-active and sterile-sterile components) of the 6x6 mass matrix are\ndiagonal with degenerate entries of opposite sign. They dominate over the 3x3\nDirac component. In such a texture the neutrino masses are $ m_1 = -m_4 \\simeq\nm_2 = -m_5 \\simeq m_3 = -m_6 $ with the mass-squared differences $\\Delta\nm^2_{21} \\ll \\Delta m^2_{32} \\simeq \\Delta m^2_{31}$ and $\\Delta m^2_{41} =\n\\Delta m^2_{52} = \\Delta m^2_{63} = 0$. The last equality implies in our\ntexture the absence of oscillations for three (conventional) sterile neutrinos.\nThus, these neutrinos are here effectively decoupled, what is realized\nevidently in another way than through the popular seesaw mechanism. There\nremain the oscillations of three active neutrinos, getting the form as for\nbimaximal mixing, but with the mass spectrum following from our texture.\n", "  New experiment arrangement to study spin rotation and oscillation of\nparticles of gas target through which beam of high energy particles passes is\ndiscussed. Such experiment arrangement make it realizable for storage ring and\nallows to study zero-angle scattering amplitude at highest possible energies.\nLife-time of particle beam in storage ring can reach several hours and even\ndays. Life-time of particle in gas target (gas trap) is long too. Particles\ncirculate in storage ring with frequency $\\nu$ of several MHz that yields to\nthe $\\nu$-fold increase of density of high energy particles beam blowing gas\ntrap in comparison with single passing case.\n  Finally, this causes perfectly acceptable angle of spin rotation of particles\ncontaining in gas cell. Relation between index of refraction and effective\npotential energy of a particle in a medium is discussed. Phenomenon of spin\nrotation of a particle captured to a trap under the action of a beam of\npolarized particles is considered. Expressions for effective potential energy\nand angle of spin rotation are derived for particles in a trap. Rrotation and\noscillation of deuteron spin is studied. Estimations for angle of rotation show\nthat the effect can be experimentally observed.\n", "  We address the issue of the reconstruction of the scalar potential of a\ntwo-Higgs doublet model having in mind that of the MSSM.\n  We first consider the general CP conserving dim-4 effective potential. To\nfully reconstruct this potential, we show that even if all the Higgs masses and\ntheir couplings to the standard model particles are measured one needs not only\nto measure certain trilinear Higgs self-couplings but some of the quartic\ncouplings as well. We also advocate expressing the Higgs self couplings in the\nmass basis. We show explicitly, that in the so-called decoupling limit, the\nmost easily accessible Higgs self-couplings are given in terms of the Higgs\nmass while all other dependencies on the parameters of the general effective\npotential are screened. This helps also easily explain how, in the\n  MSSM, the largest radiative corrections which affect these self couplings are\nreabsorbed by using the corrected Higgs mass. We also extend our analysis to\nhigher order operators in the effective Higgs potential. While the above\nscreening properties do not hold, we argue that these effects must be small and\nmay not be measured considering the foreseen poor experimental precision in the\nextraction of the SUSY Higgs self-couplings.\n", "  The data of the Heidelberg-Moscow double beta decay experiment for the\nmeasuring period August 1990 - May 2000 (54.9813 kg y or 723.44 molyears),\npublished recently, are analyzed using the potential of the Bayesian method for\nlow counting rates. First evidence for neutrinoless double beta decay is\nobserved giving first evidence for lepton number violation. The evidence for\nthis decay mode is 97% (2.2\\sigma) with the Bayesian method, and 99.8% c.l.\n(3.1\\sigma) with the method recommended by the Particle Data Group. The\nhalf-life of the process is found with the Bayesian method to be T_{1/2}^{0\\nu}\n= (0.8 - 18.3) x 10^{25} y (95% c.l.) with a best value of 1.5 x 10^{25} y. The\ndeduced value of the effective neutrino mass is, with the nuclear matrix\nelements from [Sta90,Tom91] < m >= (0.11 - 0.56) eV (95% c.l.), with a best\nvalue of 0.39 eV. Uncertainties in the nuclear matrix elements may widen the\nrange given for the effective neutrino mass by at most a factor 2. Our\nobservation which at the same time means evidence that the neutrino is a\nMajorana particle, will be of fundamental importance for neutrino physics.\nPACS. 14.69.Pq Neutrino mass and mixing; 23.40.Bw Weak-interaction and lepton\n(including neutrino) aspects 23.40.-s Beta decay; double beta decay; electron\nand muon capture.\n", "  Recent data on cosmological variation of the electromagnetic fine structure\nconstant from distant quasar (QSO) absorption spectra have inspired a more\ngeneral discussion of possible variation of other constants. We discuss\nvariation of strong scale and quark masses. We derive the limits on their\nrelative change from (i) primordial Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN); (ii)\n  Oklo natural nuclear reactor, (iii) quasar absorption spectra, and (iv)\nlaboratory measurements of hyperfine intervals.\n", "  We study the event-by-event fluctuations of the charged particles and compare\nthe results of different Monte-Carlo Generators (MCG): VNIb, HIJING,\nHIJING/B${\\bar B}$ and RQMD. We find that the $D$-measure can be used to\ndistinguish between the different gluon populations that are present in the MCG\nmodels. On the other hand, the value of the $D$-measure shows high sensitivity\nto the rescattering effects in VNIb model, but lower sensitivity to the\nrescattering effects in RQMD model. We also find that the $D$-measures from AA\nare consistent with the $D$-measures from $pp$ for all generators except VNIb.\nTherefore, any deviation among the values of $D$-measure for different impact\nparameters and between\n  $pp$ and $AA$ collisions may indicate that either the rescattering effects\nplay a key role in the interactions or there is new physics in $AA$ collisions.\n", "  Multidimensional theories still remain attractive from the point of view of\nbetter understanding of fundamental interactions. In this paper we consider a\nsix - dimensional Kaluza -- Klein type model at the classical level. We derive\nstatic spherically symmetric solutions to the multidimensional Einstein\nequations. They are fundamentally different from four - dimensional\nSchwarzschild solutions: they are horizon free and the presence of massless\ndilaton field has the same dynamical effect as the existence of additional\nmassive matter in the system. Then we analyse the motion of test particles in\nsuch spherically symmetric configurations. The emphasis is put on some\nobservable quantities like redshifts. It is suggested that strange features of\nemission lines from active galactic nuclei as well as quasar - galaxy\nassociations may in fact be manifestations of multidimensionality of our world.\n", "  For Affleck-Dine baryogenesis to proceed, there must have been two types of\nphase transitions. One is the destabilized-stabilized phase transition of the\nflat direction, which is in general induced by the Hubble parameter. The other\nis the phase transition related to the A-term, which induces the misalignment\nof the relative phase of the flat direction. In the conventional Affleck-Dine\nbaryogenesis they are supposed to start almost simultaneously. Of course these\nphase transitions can take place separately, but the latter must not be later\nthan the former because the phase transition of the A-term can not produce any\nbaryon number when there is no condensate of the relative charge.\n  In this paper we try to construct models where the original idea of\nAffleck-Dine baryogenesis is realized in a different way. We show examples in\nwhich the local domain of the false vacuum with the required condensate is\nformed after inflation and collapses in a safe way so that the domain wall\nproblem is avoided. We also show examples where the phase transition of the\nA-term starts before the decay of the condensate. As in the conventional\nAffleck-Dine mechanism, the phase transition of the A-term produces baryon\nnumber in the local domain of the condensate. We construct scenarios where our\nmechanism produces sufficient baryon asymmetry of the Universe.\n", "  This note presents an overview of general-purpose and specific Monte-Carlo\nevent generators used in the simulation of the CERN - CHORUS experiment, aiming\nto search for $\\nu_{\\mu} \\to \\nu_{\\tau}$ oscillations and charm particle decays\nin an emulsion target.\n", "  The Lorentz invariant formalism for description of neutrino flavor\noscillation in moving and polarized matter is developed. It is shown that the\nneutrino effective potential, which determines the effective mass difference\nbetween neutrinos in matter can be sufficiently changed by relativistic motion\nof matter. In the case of matter motion parallel to neutrino propagation,\nmatter effects in neutrino flavor oscillations are suppressed. In the case of\nrelativistic motion of matter in the opposite direction sufficient increase of\neffects of matter in neutrino oscillations is predicted. The dependence of the\nmatter term in neutrino effective potential on the values and correlations of\nthe three vectors, the neutrino and matter speeds and matter polarization, is\ndiscussed in details.\n", "  We consider the double-radiative decays of heavy-light QED and QCD atoms,\n$\\mu^+ e^- \\to \\gamma\\gamma$ and $\\bar{B}^{0}_s \\to \\gamma\\gamma$. Especially,\nwe take under scrutiny contributions coming from operators that vanish on the\nfree-quark mass shell. We show that by field redefinitions these operators are\nconverted into contact terms attached to the bound state dynamics. A net\noff-shell contribution is suppressed with respect to the effect of the well\nknown flavour-changing magnetic-moment operator by the bound-state binding\nfactor. The negligible off-shellness of the weakly bound QED atoms becomes more\nrelevant for strongly bound QCD atoms. We analyze this off-shellness in\nmodel-approaches to QCD, one of them enabling us to keep close contact to the\nrelated effect in QED. We also comment on the off-shell effect in the\ncorresponding process $\\bar{B}_d \\to K^* \\gamma$, and discuss possible\nhindering of the claimed beyond-standard-model discovery in this decay mode.\n", "  Supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model predict a large enhancement\nof the Wilson coefficients of the dimension-five electromagnetic penguin\noperators affecting the direct CP violation in K_L --> pi^0 e^+ e^- and the\ncharge asymmetry in K^\\pm --> pi^\\pm l^+ l^-.\n  Here we compute the relevant matrix elements in the chiral quark model and\ncompare these with the ones given by lattice calculations\n", "  Small Recent theories have proposed a variety of massive particles, like the\nmoduli, whose abundance or decay endangers standard cosmological results. To\ndilute them, thermal inflation has been proposed, with its own massive scalar\nflaton field which goes on decaying in the era of Mev-scale temperatures. In\nthis paper, the effect of late-time entropy production on neutrino decoupling\nduring such reheating is investigated by including a term, arising from the\nrate of entropy production due to scalar decay, in the Boltzmann equation for\nthe neutrino number density. The effect on the decoupling temperature of\nmassless neutrinos is studied. It is found that a lower bound to the scalar\ndecay rate constant can be set at 10^{-22} Gev.\n", "  The azimuthal anisotropy of jet spectra due to energy loss of jet partons in\nazimuthally non-symmetric volume of dense quark-gluon matter is considered for\nsemi-central nuclear interactions at collider energies. We develop the\ntechniques for event-by-event analysing the jet azimuthal anisotropy using\nparticle and energy elliptic flow, and suggest a method for calculation of\ncoefficient of jet azimuthal anisotropy without reconstruction of nuclear\nreaction plane.\n", "  A QCD analysis of the world data on polarized deep inelastic scattering is\npresented in leading and next-to-leading order. New parameterizations are\nderived for the quark and gluon distributions for the kinematic range $x\n\\epsilon [10^{-9},1], Q^2 \\epsilon [1,10^6] \\GeV^2$. The extrapolation far\noutside the domain of the current measurements is given both to allow for\napplications at higher values of $Q^2$ and to be able to calculate integral\nproperties of the present distributions. The values of $\\Lambda_{\\rm QCD}$ and\n$\\alpha_s(M_z)$ are determined. Emphasis is put on the derivation of the fully\ncorrelated $1\\sigma$ error bands for these distributions, which are also given\nin terms of parameterizations and are directly applicable to determine\nexperimental errors of other polarized observables. The impact of the variation\nof both the renormalization and factorization scales on the value of $\\alpha_s$\nis studied. Finally we perform a factorization--scheme invariant QCD analysis\nbased on the observables $g_1(x,Q^2)$ and $d g_1(x,Q^2)/d \\log(Q^2)$ in\nnext-to-leading order, which is compared to the standard analysis. A series of\nlow moments of parton densities, accounting for error correlation, are given to\nallow for comparison with results from lattice simulations.\n", "  With the time dependant CP asymmetry in $B_d(t) \\to \\psi K_S$ well measured,\nthe most powerful method to search for {\\em direct} CP violation in $B_d$\ndecays is to analyze whether the CP asymmetry of other transitions like $B_d(t)\n\\to \\pi ^+ \\pi ^-, \\eta ^{\\prime}K_S$ etc. can be described by a $sin$ term\ntaken from $B_d(t) \\to \\psi K_S$ and without a cos term. The failure of such a\nconstrained fit would establish direct CP violation (even if no CP asymmetry\nwere observed in these other modes).\n", "  We present a systematic way to combine the global color model and the\ninstanton liquid model to calculate the chiral\n  Lagrangian coefficients. Our numerical results are in agreement well with the\nexperimental values.\n", "  In a model with a gauge group $G_{SM}\\otimes U(1)_X$, where $G_{SM} \\equiv\nSU(3)_C \\otimes SU(2)_L \\otimes U(1)_Y$ is the standard model gauge group and\n$U(1)_X$ is a horizontal local gauge symmetry, the spectrum of charged fermion\nmasses and mixing angles are obtained from radiative contributions with the aim\nto reproduce the fermion masses and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix with\nno {\\it a priori} texture assumption. The assignment of horizontal charges is\nmade such that at tree level only the third family becomes massive when\nelectroweak symmetry is broken. Using these tree level masses and introducing\nexotic scalars, the light families of charged fermions acquire hierarchical\nmasses through radiative corrections. The rank three mass matrices obtained are\nwritten in terms of a minimal set of free parameters in order to estimate their\nvalues by a numerical fit performance.\n  The resulting masses and CKM mixing angles turn out to be in good agreement\nwith the known values.\n  The new exotic scalar fields mediate flavor changing processes and contribute\nto the anomalous magnetic moments of fermions, additionaly branching ratios an$\nmagnetic moments contributions were evaluated for leptons.\n", "  In order to explain the recently reported result on the double beta decay\n$(0\\nu\\beta\\beta)$ experiment, together with the earlier established data on\nLMA MSW solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations, we generate the textures\nof the nearly degenerate as well as the inverted hierarchical models of the\nleft-handed Majorana neutrino mass matrices within the framework of the see-saw\nmechanism in a model independent way.\n  The leptonic mixings are generated from the texture of the right- handed\nMajorana mass matrices while keeping the Dirac neutrino mass matrices in\ndiagonal forms.\n", "  We present a ``hierarchical'' strategy for phase space generation in order to\nefficiently map the antenna momentum structures, typically occurring in QCD\namplitudes.\n", "  We develop the Ginzburg-Landau approach to comparing different possible\ncrystal structures for the crystalline color superconducting phase of QCD, the\nQCD incarnation of the Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell phase. In this phase,\nquarks of different flavor with differing Fermi momenta form Cooper pairs with\nnonzero total momentum, yielding a condensate that varies in space like a sum\nof plane waves. We work at zero temperature, as is relevant for compact star\nphysics. The Ginzburg-Landau approach predicts a strong first-order phase\ntransition (as a function of the chemical potential difference between quarks)\nand for this reason is not under quantitative control. Nevertheless, by\norganizing the comparison between different possible arrangements of plane\nwaves (i.e. different crystal structures) it provides considerable qualitative\ninsight into what makes a crystal structure favorable. Together, the\nqualitative insights and the quantitative, but not controlled, calculations\nmake a compelling case that the favored pairing pattern yields a condensate\nwhich is a sum of eight plane waves forming a face-centered cubic structure.\nThey also predict that the phase is quite robust, with gaps comparable in\nmagnitude to the BCS gap that would form if the Fermi momenta were degenerate.\nThese predictions may be tested in ultracold gases made of fermionic atoms. In\na QCD context, our results lay the foundation for a calculation of vortex\npinning in a crystalline color superconductor, and thus for the analysis of\npulsar glitches that may originate within the core of a compact star.\n", "  We analyze the allowed energy levels of Hawking radiation from Schwarzschild\nsurfaces in space-times with large extra dimensions. From the requirement that\nthe wave functions associated with these particles be single-valued and obey\nradial boundary conditions, we derive an upper bound of their discrete energy\nspectrum as a function of the number of large extra dimensions and the mass of\nthe black hole. Furthermore, we investigate the spacing of the energy levels.\n", "  Assuming the solar neutrino deficit is resolved by the resonant interaction\nof the neutrino magnetic moment with the solar magnetic field --in the\nframework of Resonant Spin Flavour Precession (RSFP) scenario-- the solar\nmagnetic field profile function has been derived from the scenario in the light\nof solar neutrino data. An approximate qualitative analysis has been done for\nvanishing vacuum mixing and it has been found that the profile derived is quite\nstable in nature. As because on changing the neutrino parameters ($\\mu_{\\nu},\n\\Delta{m^2}$) and the solar neutrino data the profile is just scaled along the\naxes. In principle, the nature of the profile is strongly dependent on the\nsolar matter density distribution function. The current approach is quite\ndifferent from the usual one- in which the best field profile is discovered by\nperforming $\\chi^{2}_{min.}$ calculations using solar neutrino data.\nFurthermore, the profile derived in the present work --when tested by\n$\\chi^{2}_{min.}$ calculations-- was found to be the best suited one, for the\nsolar interior.\n", "  In this talk I will consider the possibility of distinguish the usual three\nneutrino model from scenarios in which a light sterile neutrino is also\npresent. I will show that the confusion with the so-called 3+1 scheme can arise\nin some particular region of the parameter space whereas it is essentially\nabsent for the 2+2 scheme.\n  Then I will discuss the ambiguities in the determination of the CP-violating\nphase $\\delta$.\n", "  In this paper we consider dissipative hydrodynamic equations for systems with\ncontinuous broken symmetries. We first present the case of superfluidity, in\nwhich the symmetry U(1) is broken and then generalize to the chiral symmetry\n$SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R$. The corresponding new transport coefficients are\nintroduced.\n", "  The self-energy of an eta meson in the nuclear medium is calculated in a\nchiral unitary approach.\n  A coupled channel Bethe-Salpeter equation is solved to obtain the effective\neta-N interaction in the medium.\n  The base model reproduces well the free space pi-N elastic and inelastic\nscattering at the eta-N threshold or N^*(1535) region.\n  The Pauli blocking on the nucleons, binding potentials for the baryons and\nself-energies of the mesons are incorporated, including the eta self-energy in\na self-consistent way.\n  Our calculation predicts about -54 -i29 MeV for the optical potential at\nnormal nuclear matter for an eta at threshold but also shows a strong energy\ndependence of the potential.\n", "  This dissertation reviews the Standard Model formalism as well as the Lepton\nFlavour Violating (LFV) decay processes which cause its extension, known as the\nphysics beyond the SM. Firstly, using the experimental bounds on three body LFV\ndecays, the corresponding bounds on two body LFV decays are reviewed. The\ndynamical suppression of three body LFV decays due to momentum dependent\ncouplings is also reviewed. Secondly, the role of the LFV decays to explain the\nLSND excess is discussed in detail, for which the experimental bounds on three\nbody LFV decays, i.e. \\mu -> 3e are used to constraint the coupling\n\\tilde{g}_{Z_{\\mu e}}, which is needed to calculate the anomalous muon decay\n\\mu -> e\\nu_l\\bar{\\nu}_l. Then comparing the effective coupling of anomalous\nmuon decay to r>1.6\\times 10^{-3} [9809524], it is proved that LFV is not the\ncorrect hypothesis to explain the LSND excess. Finally, LFV decays at loop\norder are studied in Seesaw model of neutrino masses [PRL. 86 2502 (2001)]\nwhere the smallness of the Seesaw neutrino mass may be naturally realized with\nm_N (mass of right-handed singlet neutrinos) of order 1 TeV. It is shown that\nthe Higgs mass of a new scalar doublet with lepton number L=-1 needed in the\nmodel has to be larger than 50 TeV to get the branching ratio of \\mu -> 3e to\nbe consistent with the existing bound on \\mu -> 3e. This defeats the original\nmotivation of the model, namely that there is no physics beyond the TeV energy\nscale.\n", "  We calculate the fluxes and energy spectra of high-energy (E > 50 GeV)\nneutrinos from the annihilations of supermassive (10^8 GeV < M < 10^16 GeV),\nstrongly interacting dark matter particles in the core of the Sun. We take all\nsignificant aspects of neutrino propagation through matter into account, as\nwell as oscillations in matter and vacuum. We also calculate the resulting\nevent rates in an idealized 1 km^3 ice detector. We find that the signal should\nbe well above background and easily observed by next-generation neutrino\ndetectors such as IceCube.\n", "  We propose extended version of stationary string model to describe the\nnuclear attenuation. This model takes into account flavour content of particles\nand allows to include into consideration all hadrons created from string.\n  The predictions of the model are compared with experimental results obtained\nby HERMES collaboration (DESY) on different nuclei (N and Kr).\n", "  We study the conditions under which flavor violation arises in scalar-fermion\ninteractions, as a result of the mixing phenomena between the standard model\nand exotic fermions. Phenomenological consequences are discussed within the\nspecific context of a left-right model where these additional fermions have\nmirror properties under the new SU(2)_R gauge group.\n  Bounds on the parameters of the model are obtained from LFV processes; these\nresults are then used to study the LFV Higgs decays (H --> tau l_j, l_j = e,\nmu), which reach branching ratios that could be detected at future colliders.\n", "  The paper is being withdrawn because of some theoretical inconsistencies.\n", "  R-parity violation in the supersymmetric standard model can be the source of\nneutrino masses and mixing. We analyze the neutrino mass matrix coming from\neither bilinear or trilinear R-parity violation and its collider signatures,\nassuming that the atmospheric and solar neutrino data are explained by three\nactive neutrino oscillations. Taking the gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking\nmechanism, we show that the lightest neutralino decays well inside the detector\nand the model could be tested by observing its branching ratios in the future\ncolliders. In the bilinear model where only the small solar neutrino mixing\nangle can be accommodated, the relation, $10^3$ BR($\\nu e^\\pm \\tau^\\mp$) $\\sim$\nBR($\\nu \\mu^\\pm \\tau^\\mp$) $\\approx$ BR($\\nu \\tau^\\pm \\tau^\\mp$), serves as a\nrobust test of the model. The large mixing angle solution can be realized in\nthe trilinear model which predicts BR($\\nu e^\\pm \\tau^\\mp$) $\\sim$ BR($\\nu\n\\mu^\\pm \\tau^\\mp$) $\\sim$ BR($\\nu \\tau^\\pm \\tau^\\mp$). In either case, the\nrelation, BR($e jj$) $\\ll$ BR($\\mu jj$) $\\sim$ BR($\\tau jj$), should hold to be\nconsistent with the atmospheric neutrino and CHOOZ experiments.\n", "  The phenomenological investigation of noncommutative space-time in the\nlaboratory frame are presented. We formulate the apparent time variation of\nnoncommutativity parameter $\\theta_{\\mu\\nu}$ in the laboratory frame due to the\nearth's rotation. Furthermore, in the noncommutative QED, we discuss how to\nprobe the electric-like component\n  $\\overrightarrow{\\theta_{E}}=(\\theta_{01},\\theta_{02},\\theta_{03})$ by the\nprocess $e^-e^+\\to\\gamma\\gamma$ at future $e^-e^+$ linear collider.\n  We may determine the magnitude and the direction of\n  $\\overrightarrow{\\theta_{E}}$ by detailed study of the apparent time\nvariation of total cross section.\n  In case of us observing no signal, the upper limit on the magnitude of\n$\\overrightarrow{\\theta_E^{}}$ can be determined independently of its\ndirection.\n", "  On the analogy with the Lamb shift, we study the vacuum effect that proton's\nelectric field interacts with virtual particles in the vacuum. We find a\npossible quantum instability that triggered by an external force, proton's\nelectric field interacting with virtual particles spontaneously induces a\nquantum force that back reacts on the proton in the direction of the external\ntrigger force. Such a quantum-induced force accelerates the proton runaway, by\ngaining the zero-point energy from the vacuum (~10^{-5} eV/cm). This effect\npossibly accounts for the mysterious origin and spectrum of ultra high-energy\ncosmic ray (UHECR) events above 10^{20}eV, and explains the puzzle why the GZK\ncutoff is absent. The candidates of these events could be primary protons from\nthe early Universe.\n", "  I review recent constraints on and claimed detections of a time-varying\nfine-structure constant $\\alpha$. Our results are consistent with no variation\nin $\\alpha$ from the epoch of recombination to the present day, and restrict\nany such variation to be less than about 4%. The forthcoming MAP and Planck\nexperiments will be able to break most of the currently existing degeneracies\nbetween $\\alpha$ and other cosmological parameters, and measure $\\alpha$ in the\nearly universe with an accuracy comparable to current claimed recent-universe\ndetections.\n", "  Prompted by recent solar and atmospheric data, we re-analyze the\nfour-neutrino description of current global neutrino oscillation data,\nincluding the LSND evidence for oscillations. The higher degree of rejection\nfor non-active solar and atmospheric oscillation solutions implied by the SNO\nneutral current result as well as by the latest 1489-day Super-K atmospheric\nneutrino data allows us to rule out (2+2) oscillation schemes proposed to\nreconcile LSND with the rest of current neutrino oscillation data. Using an\nimproved goodness of fit (gof) method especially sensitive to the combination\nof data sets we obtain a gof of only 1.6 times 10^{-6} for (2+2) schemes.\nFurther, we re-evaluate the status of (3+1) oscillations using two different\nanalyses of the LSND data sample. We find that also (3+1) schemes are strongly\ndisfavoured by the data. Depending on the LSND analysis we obtain a gof of 5.6\ntimes 10^{-3} or 7.6 times 10^{-5}. This leads to the conclusion that all\nfour-neutrino descriptions of the LSND anomaly, both in (2+2) as well as (3+1)\nrealizations, are highly disfavoured. Our analysis brings the LSND hint to a\nmore puzzling status.\n", "  We study the CP dependence of neutrino oscillation probability for all\nchannels in arbitrary matter profile within three generations. We show that an\noscillation probability for \\nu_e \\to \\nu_\\mu can be written in the form\nP(\\nu_e \\to \\nu_\\mu) =A_{e\\mu} cos \\delta + B_{e\\mu} sin \\delta + C_{e\\mu}\nwithout any approximation using the CP phase \\delta. This result holds not only\nin constant matter but also in arbitrary matter. Another probability for\n\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_\\tau can be written in the form P(\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_\\tau)=\nA_{\\mu\\tau} cos \\delta + B_{\\mu\\tau} sin \\delta\n  + C_{\\mu\\tau} + D_{\\mu\\tau} cos 2\\delta + E_{\\mu\\tau} sin 2\\delta. The term\nwhich is proportional to sin 2\\delta disappear, namely E_{\\mu\\tau}=0, in\nsymmetric matter. It means that the probability reduces to the same form as in\nconstant matter. As for other channels, probabilities in arbitrary matter are\nat most the quadratic polynomials of sin \\delta and cos \\delta as in the above\ntwo channels. In symmetric matter, the oscillation probability for each channel\nreduces to the same form with respect to \\delta as that in constant matter.\n", "  A short overview is given on how generalized parton distributions (GPDs)\nenter in a variety of hard exclusive processes such as deeply virtual Compton\nscattering (DVCS) and hard meson electroproduction reactions on the nucleon. We\nfirstly discuss the links between GPDs and elastic nucleon form factors which\nrepresent powerful constraints on parametrizations of GPDs. Subsequently, we\nshow some key observables which are sensitive to the various hadron structure\naspects of the GPDs, and which are at present under experimental investigation\nat different facilities (HERMES, H1/ZEUS, JLab and Compass), or will be\naddressed by experiments in the near future.\n", "  General Classification of Matter; Prequarks and Number of Quarks; Structure\nof Nucleons; Generation of Quark Masses; Seas and Sizes of Nucleons;\nContributions of Nucleons Seas to the Structure Functions; Higgs Bosons; Bosons\nof the\n  Strong and Superstrong Interactions; The Nature of Gluons, Super QCD, The\n  Energies of Baryons and Mesons; The Sizes of Baryons and Mesons; The\n  Confinement Constant at the Top Quark Scale, The Formation and Evolution of\nGalaxies; The Formation of Galaxies and Primordial Stars; The Evolution of\nGalaxies; The Formation of Structure; The Rotation of Spiral Galaxies;\n  The Non Existence of Dark Matter and Black Holes; Associated Fermions and the\nDual Role of Neutrinos; The Hidden Realm of Gravity; The Connection between\nNeutrinos and the Superweak Force; The Galactic Medium as a Neutrino\n  Gas; Energy Bands of Neutrinos; Another Solution to the Solar Neutrino\nProblem; The Stability of the Deuteron, Triton and Alpha Particle; The\n  Absence of Nuclides with A=5 and the Instability of Be8.\n", "  Contents :\n  1.

Keeping the\nfluctuations small would require a very precise fine-tuning of the low-energy\nconstants L_4 and L_6 to L_4[crit](M_rho) = - 0.51 * 10^(-3), and\nL_6[crit](M_rho) = - 0.26 * 10^(-3). A small deviation from these critical\nvalues -- like the one suggested by the phenomenology of OZI-rule violation in\nthe scalar channel -- is amplified by huge numerical factors inducing large\neffects of vacuum fluctuations. This would lead in particular to a strong\nN_f-dependence of chiral symmetry breaking and a suppression of multi-flavour\nchiral order parameters. A simple resummation is shown to cure the instability\nof N_f>=3 ChPT, but it modifies the standard expressions of some O(p^2) and\nO(p^4) low-energy parameters in terms of observables. On the other hand, for\nr=m_s/m > 15, the two-flavour condensate is not suppressed, due to the\ncontribution induced by massive vacuum s-bar s pairs. Thanks to the latter, the\nstandard two-flavour ChPT is protected from multi-flavour instabilities and\ncould provide a well-defined expansion scheme in powers of non-strange quark\nmasses.\n", "  We examine random matrix models of QCD which are capable of supporting both\nchiral and diquark condensation. A numerical study of the spectral densities\nnear zero virtuality shows that the introduction of color in the interactions\ndoes not alter the one-body results imposed by chiral symmetry. A model with\nthree colors has the spectral density predicted for the chiral ensemble with a\nDyson index beta = 2; a pseudoreal model with two colors exhibits the spectral\ndensity of the chiral ensemble with beta = 1.\n", "  Valence u- and d-quarks distributions in proton are calculated in QCD at low\n$Q^2$ and intermediate x, basing on the operator product expansion (OPE). The\nimaginary part of the virtual photon scattering amplitude on quark current with\nproton quantum numbers is considered. The initial and final virtualities\n$p^2_1$ and $p^2_2$ of the currents are assumed to be large, negative and\ndifferent, $p^2_1 \\not= p^2_2$. The OPE in $p^2_1$, $p^2_2$ up to dimension 6\noperators was performed. Double dispersion representations in $p^2_1, p^2_2$ of\nthe amplitudes in terms of physical states contributions are used. Putting them\nto be equal to those calculated in QCD, the sum rules for quark distributions\nare found. The double Borel transformations are applied to the sum rules.\nLeading order perturbative corrections are accounted. Valence quark\ndistributions are found: $u(x)_v$ at $0.15<x<65$,~ $d(x)_v$ at $0.25<x<0.55$\nwith an accuracy $\\sim 30%$ in the middles and $\\sim 50%$ at the ends of these\nintervals. The quark distributions obtained are in agreement with those found\nfrom the analysis of hard processes data.\n", "  We investigate a particle physics model in a six-dimensional spacetime, where\ntwo extra dimensions form a torus. Particles with Standard Model charges are\nconfined by interactions with a scalar field to four four-dimensional branes,\ntwo vortices accommodating ordinary type fermions and two antivortices\naccommodating mirror fermions. We investigate the phenomenological implications\nof this multibrane structure by confronting the model with neutrino physics\ndata.\n", "  We study the double deeply virtual Compton scattering (DDVCS) process off the\nnucleon, through the scattering of a spacelike virtual photon with large\nvirtuality resulting in the production of a timelike virtual photon, decaying\ninto an e^+ e^- pair. This process is expressed in the Bjorken regime in terms\nof generalized parton distributions (GPDs) and it is shown that by varying the\ninvariant mass of the lepton pair, one can directly extract the GPDs from the\nobservables. We give predictions for the DDVCS cross section and beam helicity\nasymmetry and discuss its experimental feasibility.\n", "  We investigate the potential of a future kilometer-scale neutrino telescope\nsuch as the proposed IceCube detector in the South Pole, to measure and\ndisentangle the yet unknown components of the cosmic neutrino flux, the prompt\natmospheric neutrinos coming from the decay of charmed particles and the\nextra-galactic neutrinos, in the 10 TeV to 1 EeV energy range.\n  Assuming a power law type spectra,\n  $d\\phi_\\nu/dE_\\nu \\sim \\alpha E_\\nu^\\beta$, we quantify the discriminating\npower of the IceCube detector and discuss how well we can determine magnitude\n($\\alpha$) as well as slope ($\\beta$) of these two components of the high\nenergy neutrino spectrum, taking into account the background coming from the\nconventional atmospheric neutrinos.\n", "  The aim of the work is to study LFV in a newly proposed Seesaw model of\nneutrino mass and to see whether it could explain LSND excess. The motivation\nof this Seesaw model was that there was no new physics beyond the TeV scale. By\nstudying \\mu \\to 3e in this model, it is shown that the upper bound on the\nbranching ratio requires Higgs mass m_{h} of a new scalar doublet with lepton\nnumber L=-1 needed in the model has to be about 9 TeV.

The double spin asymmetries\nfor longitudinally polarized leptons and transversely polarized protons in\ndiffractive vector meson and $Q \\bar Q$ production at high energies within the\ntwo-gluon model is analysed.\n  The asymmetry predicted for meson production is found to be quite small. The\n$A_{lT}$ asymmetry for $Q \\bar Q$ production is large and can be used to obtain\ninformation on the polarized skewed gluon distributions in the proton.\n", "  The physics potential of low-performance and high-performance neutrino\nfactories is briefly reviewed..\n", "  I give a short overview about the possibilities and problems related to the\nmeasurement of CP violation in long baseline experiments.

The CP violation reach for different experiments is\ncompared in dependence of $\\sin^22\\theta_{13}$ and $\\dm{21}$. Furthermore a\nshort comment about the possible effects of matter induced T violation is made.\nFinally the limits on CPT violation obtainable at a neutrino factory are shown.\n", "  We investigate the phase structure of hot and/or dense QCD using the\nSchwinger-Dyson equation (SDE) with the improved ladder approximation in the\nLandau gauge. We show that the phase transition from the two-flavor color\nsuperconducting (2SC) phase to the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) phase is of second\norder, and that the scaling properties of the Majorana mass gap and the diquark\ncondensate are consistent with mean field scaling. We examine the effect of the\nantiquark contribution and find that setting the antiquark Majorana mass equal\nto the quark one is a good approximation in the medium density region. We also\nstudy the effect of the Debye screening mass of the gluon and find that\nignoring it causes the critical lines to move to the region of higher\ntemperature and higher chemical potential.\n", "  Statistical hadronization models are extremly succesful in describing\nmeasured ratios of hadrons produced in heavy-ion collisions for a wide range of\nbeam energies from SIS to RHIC. Using the idea of statistical hadronization at\nthe phase boundary within the framework of a recently proposed dynamical model\nfor the thermodynamics of fireballs, we establish a relation between the\nequation of state (EoS) in the partonic phase probed at the phase transition\ntemperature T_C and the measured hadron ratios. In this way, the ratios can be\npredicted parameter-free. We demonstrate that this framework gives a consistent\ndescription of conditions both at SPS and RHIC. As the data on dilepton\nemission from heavy ion collisions give evidence for strong in-medium\nmodifications of hadronic properties, we schematically investigate the\nsensitivity of our results to such modifications and qualitatively sketch a\nconsistent scenario involving such in-medium effects.\n", "  We investigate resonant spin-flavor (RSF) conversions of supernova neutrinos\nwhich are induced by the interaction of neutrino magnetic moment and supernova\nmagnetic fields. From the formulation which includes all three-flavor neutrinos\nand anti-neutrinos, we give a new crossing diagram that includes not only\nordinary MSW resonance but also magnetically-induced RSF effect. With the\ndiagram, it is found that four conversions occur in supernova, two are induced\nby the RSF effect and two by the pure MSW. We also numerically calculate\nneutrino conversions in supernova matter, using neutrino mixing parameters\ninferred from recent experimental results and a realistic supernova progenitor\nmodel. The results indicate that until 0.5 seconds after core bounce, the\n  RSF-induced $\\bar{\\nu}_e \\leftrightarrow \\nu_\\tau$ transition occurs\nefficiently (adiabatic resonance), when $\\mu_\\nu \\agt 10^{-12} \\mu_B\n  (B_0 / 5 \\times 10^{9} \\mathrm G)^{-1}$, where $B_0$ is the strength of the\nmagnetic field at the surface of iron core. We also evaluate the energy\nspectrum as a function of $\\mu_\\nu B_0$ at the SuperKamiokande detector and the\nSudbury Neutrino Observatory using the calculated conversion probabilities, and\nfind that the spectral deformation might have possibility to provide useful\ninformation on neutrino magnetic moment as well as magnetic field strength in\nsupernovae.\n", "  Schwinger-Dyson equations for propagators are solved for the scalar $\\Phi^3$\ntheory and massive Wick-Cutkosky model.\n  With the help of integral representation the results are obtained directly in\nMinkowski space in and beyond bare vertex approximation. Various\nrenormalization scheme are employed which differ by the finite strength field\nrenormalization function $Z$ . The $S-$matrix is puzzled from the Green's\nfunction and the effect of truncation of the DSEs is studied. Independently on\nthe approximation the numerical solution breaks down for certain critical value\nof the coupling constant, for which the on-shell renormalized propagator starts\nto develop the unphysical singularity at very high space-like square of\nmomenta.\n", "  In this paper we study flavor violation in supersymmetric models with gauged\nflavor symmetries. There are several sources of flavor violation in these\ntheories. The dominant flavor violation is the tree-level $D$-term contribution\nto scalar masses generated by flavor symmetry breaking. We present a new\napproach for suppressing this phenomenologically dangerous effects by\nseparating the flavor-breaking sector from supersymmetry-breaking one. The\nseparation can be achieved in geometrical setups or in a dynamical way. We also\npoint out that radiative corrections from the gauginos of gauged flavor\nsymmetries give sizable generation-dependent masses of scalars. The gaugino\nmass effects are generic and not suppressed even if the dominant $D$-term\ncontribution is suppressed. We also analyze the constraints on the flavor\nsymmetry sector from these flavor-violating corrections.\n", "  We study the possibilities to detect Majorana neutrinos in\n  $\\gamma \\gamma$ colliders for different center of mass energies.\n  We study the $W^\\pm W^\\pm l_j^{\\mp} l_k^{\\mp}$ ($l_j\\equiv e ,\\mu ,\\tau$)\nfinal states which are, due to leptonic number violation, a clear signature for\nintermediate Majorana neutrino contribution. Such a signal (final dileptons of\nthe same sign) is not possible if the heavy neutrinos are Dirac particles. We\npresent our results for the total cross-section as a function of the neutrino\nmass and the center of mass energies.\n", "  We explore the role of Majoron ($J$) emission in the supernova cooling\nprocess, as a source of upper bound on neutrino-Majoron coupling.\n  We show that the strongest upper bound on the coupling to $\\nu_e$ comes from\nthe $\\nu_e\\nu_e \\to J $ process in the core of a supernova. We also find bounds\non diagonal couplings of the Majoron to $\\nu_{\\mu(\\tau)}\\nu_{\\mu(\\tau)}$ and on\noff-diagonal $\\nu_e \\nu_{\\mu (\\tau)}$ couplings in various regions of the\nparameter space. We discuss the evaluation of the cross-section for\nfour-particle interactions ($\\nu \\nu \\to JJ$ and $\\nu J \\to \\nu J$). We show\nthat these are typically dominated by three-particle sub-processes and do not\ngive new independent constraints.\n", "  We consider the phenomenological implications of a soft SUSY breaking term BN\nat the TeV scale (here B is the U(1)_Y gaugino and N is the right-handed\nneutrino field). In models with a massless (or nearly massless) neutralino,\nsuch a term will give rise through the see-saw mechanism to new contributions\nto the mass matrix of the light neutrinos.\n  We treat the massless neutralino as an (almost) sterile neutrino and find\nthat its mass depends on the square of the soft SUSY breaking scale, with\ninteresting consequences for neutrino physics. We also show that, although it\nrequires fine-tuning, a massless neutralino in the MSSM or NMSSM is not\nexperimentally excluded. The implications of this scenario for neutrino physics\nare discussed.\n", "  Assuming the current best-fit solutions to the solar neutrino problem at\nlarge mixing angle, we briefly illustrate how prospective data from the Sudbury\nNeutrino Observatory (SNO) and from the Kamioka Liquid scintillator\nAnti-Neutrino Detector (KamLAND) can increase our confidence in the occurrence\nof standard matter effects on active neutrino flavor oscillations in the Sun,\nwhich are starting to emerge from current data.\n", "  We summarize the current view on Parton-Hadron duality as it applies to B\nmeson decays. It is emphasized that an OPE treatment is essential for properly\nformulating duality and its limitations. Duality violations are unlikely to\nbecome the limiting factor in describing semileptonic B width vis-a-vie higher\norder corrections. The consistent extraction of the b quark mass from B\nproduction and decays provides a striking example of the theoretical control\nachieved.\n", "  Transverse momentum imbalance between a jet produced with a hard photon is\nconsidered as a signal of medium-induced partonic energy loss in\nultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. We analyze photon-jet correlation in\nthe context of a real experimental situation at the LHC, the problem of neutral\npion background being discussed.\n", "  We discuss modification in the rapidity distribution of the transverse energy\nflow as a signal of medium-induced partonic energy loss in ultrarelativistic\nheavy ion collisions.

It is found that the non-resonance virtual photon\nannihilation gives large contributions to the observed cross sections of these\ntwo processes. By including this contribution, the form factors and branching\nfractions of these two decay modes are revised.\n", "  The azimuthal anisotropy of high-pt particle production in non-central heavy\nion collisions is among the most promising observables of partonic energy loss\nin an azimuthally non-symmetric volume of quark-gluon plasma. We discuss the\nimplications of nuclear geometry for the models of partonic energy loss in the\ncontext of recent RHIC data and consequences for observation of jet quenching\nat the LHC.\n", "  Simple approximate expressions for the relative flavor fluxes of energetic\ncosmic neutrinos detected on Earth, are presented in terms of their initial\nfluxes at the surface of the producing cosmic sites, assuming the neutrino\nmixing angles to lie in the experimentally favored region. These expressions\nhighlight the main sensitivities to the initial production fluxes as well as to\nsmall variations of the mixing angles within the experimentally preferred\nregion, thus providing simple methods to disentangle these physical quantities\nfrom cosmic neutrino data. This is more so, due to some striking mathematical\nproperties of the relative neutrino flavors at $(s_{23}=1/\\sqrt{2},\n\\~s_{13}=0)$, which somehow characterize the whole experimentally preferred\nregion.\n  We also assess the quality of our approximate expressions through a numerical\ncomparison with the exact results.\n", "  e+e- experiments at charmonium production threshold are reviewed, it is found\nthat the contribution of the continuum process via virtual photon has been\nneglected in almost all the experiments and most channels analyzed. It is\npointed out that the contribution of the continuum part may affect the final\nresults significantly in psi(2S) and psi(3770) decays, while the interference\nbetween the continuum amplitude and the resonance amplitude may even affect the\nJ/psi decays as well as the psi(2S) and psi(3770). This leads to the revise of\nthe analysis of strong and electromagnetic amplitude in psi(2S) decays,\nincluding psi(2S) ->VP which is the long lasting puzzle between J/psi and\npsi(2S) decays. For psi(3770) physics, a large constructive interference for\nlight hadron modes and destructive interference for DDbar could be responsible\nfor the discrepancy between the larger cross section of inclusive hadrons by\ndirect measurement of e+e- -> psi(3770)-> hadrons than the DDbar cross section\nmeasured using D single-tag and double-tag method.\n", "  We study the mixing among different generations of massive neutrino fields in\na\n  $SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R \\times U(1)_Y$ gauge theory which includes Majorana\nand Dirac mass terms in the Yukawa sector. Parity can be spontaneously broken\nat a scale $v_R\\simeq 10^3-10^4$ GeV. We discuss about possible candidates for\nthe Yukawa coupling matrices and we found that the model can accommodate a\nconsistent pattern for neutral fermion masses as well as neutrino oscillations.\nThe left and right sectors can be connected by a new neutral current.\n", "  We study the model-building conditions under which a sizeable\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$-decay signal to the recently reported level of~0.4 eV is due\nto Kaluza--Klein singlet neutrinos in theories with large extra dimensions. Our\nanalysis is based on 5-dimensional singlet-neutrino models compactified on an\n$S^1/Z_2$ orbifold, where the Standard--Model fields are localized on a\n3-brane. We show that a successful interpretation of a positive signal within\nthe above minimal 5-dimensional framework would require a non-vanishing shift\nof the 3-brane from the orbifold fixed points by an amount smaller than the\ntypical scale (100 MeV)$^{-1}$ characterizing the Fermi nuclear momentum. The\nresulting 5-dimensional models predict a sizeable effective Majorana-neutrino\nmass that could be several orders of magnitude larger than the light neutrino\nmasses. Most interestingly, the brane-shifted models with only one bulk sterile\nneutrino also predict novel trigonometric textures leading to mass scenarios\nwith hierarchical active neutrinos and large $\\nu_\\mu$-$\\nu_\\tau$ and\n$\\nu_e$-$\\nu_\\mu$ mixings that can fully explain the current atmospheric and\nsolar neutrino data.\n", "  The determination of absolute neutrino masses is crucial for the\nunderstanding of theories underlying the standard model, such as SUSY. We\nreview the experimental prospects to determine absolute neutrino masses and the\ncorrelations among approaches, using the Delta m^2's inferred from neutrino\noscillation experiments and assuming a three neutrino Universe.\n", "  An updated analysis of all available neutrino oscillation evidence in Reactor\n(Kamland, first 145 days of data) and Solar experiments (SK day and night\nspectra, global rates from\n  Homestake, SAGE and GALLEX) including the $SNO CC$ and $NC$ data is\npresented. In the framework of two active neutrino oscillations we determine\nthe allowed regions in neutrino parameter space, we obtain, from the Kamland\nspectral shape and global signal, the following antineutrino best solution\nparameters, $ \\Delta m^2_{kl}= 7.7\\times 10^{-5} \\eV^2, \\tan^2\\theta_{kl}=\n0.98.$ The overall effect of the measured observed ratio $R\\sim 0.6$ is that\nthe LMA region remains the only one which is still favored.\n  Combining Kamland and Solar data and assuming CPT invariance, i.e. the same\nmass matrix for neutrino and antineutrinos, we obtain the following\nantineutrino best solution parameters (LMAI solution), $ \\Delta m^2= 7.1\\times\n10^{-5} \\eV^2,\\tan^2\\theta= 0.47.$ A second solution (LMAII) appears for values\n$ \\Delta m^2= 1.5\\times 10^{-4} \\eV^2, \\tan^2\\theta= 0.48.$ We determine\nadditionally individual neutrino mixing parameters and their errors from fits\nto marginal likelihood distributions, the values are compatible with previous\nresults. In both methods, $\\chi^2$ minimization and marginal likelihood, the\ncombined analysis of solar and Kamland data concludes that maximal mixing is\nnot favored at the $\\sim 3\\sigma $ level at least.\n", "  The high energy elastic nucleon cross section is treated from the viewpoint\nof the basic principles of local field theory.\n  The connection between the energy dependence of $\\sigma_{tot}$ and the $\\rho$\n- ratio of the real to imaginary parts of the forward elastic scattering\namplitude is examined in the framework of dispersion relations, derivative\ndispersion relations and crossing symmetry.\n", "  The transformation of space-time $x_{\\mu}$ and ${x_{\\mu}}^{\\prime}$ in the\ntwo inertial reference frames $\\sum$ and\n  ${\\sum}^{\\prime}$ in which their relative velocity is less than light speed,\nand the relation of a particle mass $m$ with its movement velocity\n  $v$ and so on are expatiated by Einstein's special theory of relativity.\n  In this paper, we set forth a new transformation of space-time $x_{\\mu}$ and\n${x_{\\mu}}^{\\prime}$ in two inertial reference frames in which their relative\nvelocity is equal to or more than light speed, the new relation of a particle\nmass $m$ and energy $E$ with its velocity $v$ $(v \\geq c)$, the new mass-energy\nequation and the new dynamics equation of a particle.\n", "  We follow our previous paper on possible cosmological variation of weak scale\n(quark masses) and strong scale, inspired by data on cosmological variation of\nthe electromagnetic fine structure constant from distant quasar (QSO)\nabsorption spectra. In this work we identify the {\\em strange quark mass} $m_s$\nas the most important quantity, and the {\\em sigma meson mass} as the\ningredient of the nuclear forces most sensitive to it. As a result, we claim\nsignificantly stronger limits on ratio of weak/strong scale\n($W=m_s/\\Lambda_{QCD}$) variation following from our previous discussion of\nprimordial Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis ($|\\delta W/W|<0.006$) and\n  Oklo natural nuclear reactor ($|\\delta W/W|<1.2 \\cdot 10^{-10}$; there is\nalso a non-zero solution\n  $\\delta W/W=(-0.56 \\pm 0.05) \\cdot 10^{-9}$) .\n", "  Heavy-light mesons, heavy quarkonium and doubly heavy baryons are briefly\ndiscussed. Effective field theories (EFTs) of QCD based on the heavy quark mass\nexpansion 1/m_Q provide a unified framework to describe all three systems. They\nproduce a number of model-independent results and simplify non-perturbative\n(lattice) calculations. Nevertheless, models are still very useful to obtain\ninexpensive estimates of many observables.\n  It is emphasized that certain models can be accommodated in the EFT\nframework, like non-relativistic potential models for heavy quarkonium. It is\nalso outlined how to build a suitable EFT for doubly heavy baryons which might\nalso accommodate existing models for these systems. Finally, a few lattice\ncalculations which are badly needed as inputs for EFTs are pointed out.\n", "  We review some of the results of our recent work dealing with the novel type\nof Higgs signals that arise when one considers extensions of the standard\nmodel.\n  We discuss first possible deviations on the Higgs couplings due to heavy\nparticles, in the context of the MSSM and with large extra-dimensions. Then, we\npresent several models where it is possible to induce flavor violating Higgs\ncouplings, and probe them at future hadron colliders through the LFV Higgs\ndecay h-> tau mu or with rare top decays.\n", "  If the fundamental Planck scale is near a TeV, then parton collisions with\nhigh enough center-of-mass energy should produce black holes. The production\nrate for such black holes has been extensively studied for the case of a\nproton-proton collision at \\sqrt s = 14 TeV and for a lead-lead collision at\n\\sqrt s = 5.5 TeV at LHC. As the parton energy density is much higher at\nlead-lead collisions than in pp collisions at LHC, one natural question is\nwhether the produced black holes will be able to absorb the partons formed in\nthe lead-lead collisions and eventually `eat' the quark-gluon plasma formed at\nLHC. In this paper, we make a quantitative analysis of this possibility and\nfind that since the energy density of partons formed in lead-lead collisions at\nLHC is about 500 GeV/fm^3, the rate of absorption for one of these black holes\nis much smaller than the rate of evaporation. Hence, we argue that black holes\nformed in such collisions will decay very quickly, and will not absorb very\nmany nearby partons. More precisely, we show that for the black hole mass to\nincrease via parton absorption at the LHC the typical energy density of quarks\nand gluons should be of the order of 10^{10} GeV/fm^3. As LHC will not be able\nto produce such a high energy density partonic system, the black hole will not\nbe able to absorb a sufficient number of nearby partons before it decays. The\ntypical life time of the black hole formed at LHC is found to be a small\nfraction of a fm/c.\n", "  Mixing between light and heavy neutrino states has been proposed as an\nexplanation (or partial explanation) for the 3-sigma NuTeV anomaly and the\n2-sigma departure of the $Z^0$ invisible width from its expected value. I\nassume herein that neutrino masses and mixings result from the conventional\nseesaw mechanism involving six chiral neutrino states, the first three being\nmembers of weak doublets, the others weak singlets. A finely-tuned choice of\nboth the (bare) Majorana masses and the (Higgs-induced) Dirac masses can fit\nsolar and atmospheric neutrino data and also result in significant (but\nnecessarily flavor-dependent) mixing between singlet and doublet states such as\nwould yield detectable suppression of light neutrino interaction amplitudes.\nThe possibility for this kind of suppressive mixing is constrained by the\nobserved upper limit on radiative muon decay.\n", "  The publicly available Super-Kamiokande 10 day plot data have been searched\nfor a periodic modulation in the range between 10 and 500 days, with the\nperiodogram method. A peak is observed for T = 13.75 days, significant at 98.9%\nC.L. I discuss possible ways to check this result and, if confirmed, to\ninvestigate its origin.\n", "  We apply our solution of the nonlinear evolution equation to the case of\n  $J/\\psi$ photo and DIS production on nucleons and nuclei targets. The\nuncertainty in the $J/\\psi$ wave function normalization due to Fermi motion is\ntreated as a free parameter. We obtain good reproduction of the HERA\nexperimental data on a proton target. Calculations of $J/\\psi$ mesons coherent\nproduction on nuclei targets are presented and discussed. Our analysis supports\nthe conclusions reached in our previous studies, stressing the importance of\nnonlinear evolution in the kinematical domain of high-density QCD.\n", "  As the first in a series of systematic work on dense hadronic matter, we\nstudy the properties of the pion in dense medium using Skyrme's effective\nLagrangian as a unified theory of the hadronic interactions applicable in the\nlarge $N_c$ limit. Dense baryonic matter is described as the ground state of a\nskyrmion matter which appears in two differentiated phases as a function of\nmatter density: i) at high densities as a stable cubic-centered (CC)\nhalf-skyrmion crystal; ii) at low densities as an unstable face-centered cubic\n(FCC) skyrmion crystal. We substitute the latter by a stable inhomogeneous\nphase of lumps of dense matter, which represents a naive Maxwell construction\nof the phase transition. This baryonic dense medium serves as a background for\nthe pions whose effective {\\em in-medium} Lagrangian we construct by allowing\ntime-dependent quantum fluctuations on the classical dense matter field. We\nfind that the same parameter which describes the phase transition for baryonic\nmatter, the expectation value of the $\\sigma$ field, also describes the phase\ntransition for the dynamics of the {\\em in-medium} pion. Thus, the structure of\nthe baryonic ground state $crucially$ determines the behavior of the pion in\nthe medium. As matter density increases, $<\\sigma>$ decreases, a phenomenon\nwhich we interpret to signal, in terms of the parameters of the effective pion\nLagrangian $f_\\pi^*$ and $m_\\pi^*$, the restoration of chiral symmetry at high\ndensity. Our calculation shows also the important role played by the higher\npowers in the density as it increases and chiral symmetry is being restored.\nThis feature is likely to be generic at high density although our ground state\nmay not be the true ground state.\n", "  Two-photon decay rates of pseudoscalar, scalar and tensor states of\ncharmonium and bottomonium are calculated in the framework of the relativistic\nquark model. Both relativistic effects and one-loop radiative corrections are\ntaken into account. The obtained results are compared with other theoretical\npredictions and available experimental data.\n", "  We consider the transverse-momentum (q_T) distribution of Higgs bosons\nproduced at hadron colliders. We use a formalism that uniformly treats both the\nsmall-q_T and large-q_T regions in QCD perturbation theory. At small q_T (q_T\n<< M_H, M_H being the mass of the Higgs boson), we implement an all-order\nresummation of logarithmically-enhanced contributions up to\nnext-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. At large q_T (q_T \\gtap M_H), we\nuse fixed-order perturbation theory up to next-to-leading order. The resummed\nand fixed-order approaches are consistently matched by avoiding double-counting\nin the intermediate-q_T region. In this region, the introduction of unjustified\nhigher-order terms is avoided by imposing unitarity constraints, so that the\nintegral of the q_T spectrum exactly reproduces the perturbative result for the\ntotal cross section up to next-to-next-to-leading order. Numerical results at\nthe LHC are presented. These show that the main features of the q_T\ndistribution are quite stable with respect to perturbative QCD uncertainties.\n", "  Strongly attractive color forces in the flavor singlet channel may lead to a\nstable H dibaryon. Here we show that an H or other compact, flavor singlet\nhadron is unlikely to bind to nuclei, so that bounds on exotic isotopes do not\nexclude their stability. Remarkably, a stable H appears to evade other\nexperimental constraints as well, when account is taken of its expected compact\nspatial wavefunction.\n", "  We calculate the suppression in the rate at which two baryons in a nucleus\n(viz., nucleons or $\\Lambda$'s) convert to an H dibaryon, using an Isgur-Karl\nwavefunction for quarks in the baryons and H, and a Bethe-Goldstone\nwavefunction for the baryons in the nucleus. If $r_H \\lsi 1/3~ r_N$, we find\n$\\tau_{A_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}\\to A'_H}\\gsi \\tau_\\Lambda$ and the observation of\n$\\Lambda$ decays from double-$\\Lambda$ hypernuclei does not exclude the\nexistence of the H. If $m_H < 2 m_p$, nuclei are unstable but have very long\nlifetimes. For reasonable values of $r_H$ and the nuclear wavefunction, the\nlifetime can be long enough to evade anticipated SuperK limits $\\tau_{A_{NN}\\to\nA'_H}\\gsi {\\rm few} 10^{29}$ yr, or short enough to be observed. An analysis of\nSuperK data to look for this possibility should be undertaken.\n", "  I review the physics of the Higgs sector in the Standard Model and its\nminimal supersymmetric extension, the MSSM. I will discuss the prospects for\ndiscovering the Higgs particles at the upgraded Tevatron, at the Large Hadron\nCollider, and at a future high--energy $e^+e^-$ linear collider with\ncentre--of--mass energy in the 350--800 GeV range, as well as the possibilities\nfor studying their fundamental properties. Some emphasis will be put on the\ntheoretical developments which occurred in the last two years.\n", "  Jet shape observables which involve measurements restricted to a part of\nphase space are sensitive to multiplication of soft gluon with large relative\nangles and give rise to specific single logarithmically enhanced (SL) terms\n(non-global logs). We consider associated distributions in two variables which\ncombine measurement of a jet shape V in the whole phase space (global) and that\nof the transverse energy flow away from the jet direction, Eout (non-global).\nWe show that associated distributions factorize into the global distribution in\nV and a factor that takes into account SL contributions from multi-gluon\n``hedgehog'' configurations in all orders. The latter is the same that\ndescribes the single-variable Eout distribution, but evaluated at a rescaled\nenergy VQ.\n", "  We discuss the modification of a jet fragmentation function due to\nmedium-induced partonic energy loss in context of leading particle observables\nin ultrarelativistic nucleus-nucleus interactions. We also analyze the relation\nbetween in-medium softening jet fragmentation function and suppression of the\njet rates due to energy loss outside the jet cone. The predicted\nanti-correlation between two effects allows to probe a fraction of partonic\nenergy loss carried out of the jet cone and truly lost to the jet.\n", "  We determine mass and transverse momentum spectra of dileptons produced in\nPb+Au (158 GeV/u) collisions within a pion annihilation model.\n  A fit to the data requires simultaneous mass reduction and broadening of the\nin-medium rho propagator.\n  The introduction of a finite pion width, as required within self-consistent\napproaches to the interacting pion gas, further improves the agreement with the\ndata.\n", "  The strong and the electromagnetic amplitudes are analyzed on the basis of\nthe measurements of J/psi, psi(2S) -> 1-0- in e+e- experiments. The currently\navailable experimental information is revised with inclusion of the\ncontribution from e+e- -> gamma * -> 1-0- . The study shows that a large phase\naround minus 90 degree between the strong and the electromagnetic amplitudes\ncould not be ruled out by the experimental data for psi(2S).\n", "  We demonstrate a dynamical origin for the dimension-five seesaw operator in\ndimensional deconstruction models. Light neutrino masses arise from the seesaw\nscale which corresponds to the inverse lattice spacing. It is shown that the\ndeconstructing limit naturally prefers maximal leptonic mixing. Higher-order\ncorrections which are allowed by gauge invariance can transform the bi-maximal\ninto a bi-large mixing. These terms may appear to be non-renormalizable at\nscales smaller than the deconstruction scale.\n", "  From: Yasushi Watanabe <watanabe@tithp1.hp.phys.titech.ac.jp>\n  Date: Thu, 10 Apr 2003 08:34:09 EDT\n  Subject: withdrawal of R.Naboulsi's papers\n  ------------\n  Dear sirs:\n  I am a professor at Tokyo Institute of Technology. I wished to help a person\nlike R.Naboulsi who was trying very hard to get a fellowship to come to Japan.\nI thought he was a really genius person to produce so many papers. He says most\nof them are his original, but apparently not. Very regretful! I should have\nnoticed it much earlier.\n  He has not come to Japan yet. I am the one who let him use the affiliation of\nTokyo Institute of Technology, as he asked me saying that it is the only way to\nget the fellowship. I also asked my associate to upload because he says he\ncannot from his computer.\n  I sincerely apologize you for this unfortunate happening. I have asked my\nassociate to cancel all his papers uploaded already. Please understand that\nthis is done under a good will. He did not understand the basis of scientific\nworld. I just believed him too much.\n  I hope you understand the situation.\n  Sincerely Yours,\n  Y.Watanabe,\n  Prof. of Physics\n", "  The field responsible for the cosmological curvature perturbations generated\nduring a stage of primordial inflation might be the\n  ``curvaton'', a field different from the inflaton field. To keep the\neffective mass of the curvaton small enough compared to the Hubble rate during\ninflation one may not invoke supersymmetry since the latter is broken by the\nvacuum energy density. In this paper we propose the idea that the curvaton is a\npseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson (PNGB) so that its potential and mass vanish in\nthe limit of unbroken symmetry. We give a general framework within which PNGB\ncurvaton candidates should be explored. Then we explore various possibilities,\nincluding the case where the curvaton can be identified with the\nextra-component of a gauge field in a compactified five-dimensional theory (a\nWilson line), where it comes from a Little-Higgs mechanism, and where it is a\nstring axion so that supersymmetry is essential.\n", "  Recent CDF measurements of the inclusive cross section for a double parton\nscattering attach a great importance to any theoretical calculations of\ntwo-particle distribution functions. Using a parton interpretation of the\nleading logarithm diagrams of perturbative QCD theory, generalized\nLipatov-Altarelli-Parisi-Dokshitzer equations for the two-parton distributions\nare re-obtained. The solutions of these equations are not at all the product of\ntwo single-parton distributions what is usually applied to the current analysis\nas ansatz.\n", "  This paper proposes to apply the\n  Ultra-Relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamic (UrQMD) approach to implement\nthe PANDA project (GSI).\n  Modeling of $\\bar{p}$A-interactions has been performed at antiproton energies\nfrom 1 GeV to 200 GeV by using the UrQMD model. We have studied average\nmultiplicities, multiplicity distributions of various types of secondary\nparticles, correlations between the multiplicities, rapidity, and transverse\nmomentum distributions of the particles. The UrQMD model predictions on\ninelastic $\\bar{p}$A- collisions have been found to reproduce qualitatively the\nexperimental data. However, to reach the quantitative agreement, especially, in\nfragmentation regions, it is needed to modify the UrQMD model.\n", "  We study the effect of thermal width of $\\pi$ on the spectral function of\n$\\sigma$ applying a resummation technique called optimized perturbation theory\nat finite temperature ($T$) to ${\\cal O}(4)$ linear sigma model. In order to\ntake into account finite thermal width of $\\pi$, we replace the internal pion\nmass in the self-energy of $\\sigma$ with that of complex pole found in a\nprevious paper. The obtained spectral function for $T\\aplg 100 {\\rm MeV}$ turns\nout to possess two broad peaks. Although a sharp peak at $\\sigma\\to\\pi\\pi$\nthreshold was observed in the one-loop calculation without pion thermal width,\nthe peak is proved to be smeared out. We also search for the poles of the\n$\\sigma$ propagator and analyze the behavior of the spectral function with\nthese poles.\n", "  The twist--2 heavy flavor contributions to the polarized structure function\n$g_2(x,Q^2)$ are calculated. We show that this part of $g_2(x,Q^2)$ is related\nto the heavy flavor contribution to $g_1(x,Q^2)$ by the Wandzura--Wilczek\nrelation to all orders in the strong coupling constant. Numerical results are\npresented.\n", "  During inflation, primordial energy density fluctuations are created from\napproximate de Sitter vacuum quantum fluctuations redshifted out of the horizon\nafter which they are frozen as perturbations in the background curvature. In\nthis paper we demonstrate that there exists an intrinsic theoretical\nuncertainty in the inflationary predictions for the curvature perturbations due\nto the failure of the well known prescriptions to specify the vacuum uniquely.\nSpecifically, we show that the two often used prescriptions for defining the\ninitial vacuum state -- the Bunch-Davies prescription and the adiabatic vacuum\nprescription (even if the adiabaticity order to which the vacuum is specified\nis infinity) -- fail to specify the vacuum uniquely in generic inflationary\nspacetimes in which the total duration of inflation is finite. This conclusion\nholds despite the absence of any trans-Planckian effects or effective field\ntheory cutoff related effects. We quantify the uncertainty which is applicable\nto slow roll inflationary scenarios as well as for general FRW spacetimes and\nfind that the uncertainty is generically small. This uncertainty should be\ntreated as a minimal uncertainty that underlies all curvature perturbation\ncalculations.\n", "  We analyze the hadronic and radiative decay modes of the recently observed\n$D_{sJ}(2317)$ meson, in the hypothesis that it can be identifield with the\nscalar $s_\\ell^P={1\\over 2}^+$ state of $c \\bar s$ spectrum ($D_{s0}$). The\nmethod is based on heavy quark symmetries and Vector Meson Dominance ansatz. We\nfind that the hadronic isospin violating mode $D_{s0} \\to D_s \\pi^0$ is\nenhanced with respect to the radiative mode $D_{s0} \\to D_s^* \\gamma$. The\nestimated width of the meson is\n  $\\Gamma(D_{s0})\\simeq 7$ KeV.\n", "  We deepen the study of the so-called ``silver channel'' $\\nu_e \\to \\nu_\\tau$\n\\cite{Donini:2002rm} and of its relevance to solve some of the ambiguities that\ncan arise in the simultaneous measurement of $(\\theta_{13},\\delta)$ at the\nNeutrino Factory by presenting in full detail the characteristics of the\nconsidered OPERA-like detector and the experimental treatment of the different\nbackgrounds and signals. Furthermore, we perform a detailed study of the\nsystematic errors associated both with the OPERA-like and the magnetized-iron\ndetectors and their effects on the sensitivity. Finally, we also apply a\nrefined statistical analysis of the simulated events based on the frequentist\napproach.\n", "  We consider the out-of-equilibrium evolution of a classical condensate field\n$\\phi=<\\Phi>$ and its quantum fluctuations for a $\\Phi^4$ model in 1+1\ndimensions with a double well potential. We use the two-particle\npoint-irreducible (2PPI) formalism in the two-loop approximation. We compare\nour results to those obtained in the Hartree approximation, in the bare vertex\napproximation (BVA) and in the two-particle irreducible next-to-leading order\nlarge-N (2PI-1/N) approach, with thermal initial conditions. In the 2PPI scheme\nwe find that the system tends to the symmetric configuration at late times, as\nexpected in the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking.\n", "  For any inclusive reaction of the type $A_1({spin} 1/2)+ A_2({spin} 1/2) \\to\nB + X$, we derive new positivity constraints on spin observables and study\ntheir implications for theoretical models in view, in particular, of accounting\nfor future data from the polarized $pp$ collider at BNL-RHIC. We find that the\nsingle transverse spin asymmetry $A_N$ for several processes, in the central\nregion for example jet production, direct photon production, lepton-pair\nproduction, must be such that $|A_N| \\lappeq 1/2$, rather than the usual bound\n$|A_N| \\leq 1$.\n", "  The Heavy quark effective field theory (HQEFT) is revisited in a more\nintuitive way. It is shown that HQEFT is a consistent large component QCD of\nheavy quarks. In the non-relativistic limit, HQEFT recovers the\nnon-relativistic QCD (NRQCD). The resulting new effects in the HQEFT of QCD are\ncarefully reexamined. It is then natural to come to the comments on the usual\nheavy quark effective theory (HQET). Consistent phenomenological applications\nof HQEFT exhibit its interesting features and completeness in comparison with\nHQET. It then becomes manifest why we shall base on the HQEFT of QCD rather\nthan HQET which is an incomplete one for computing 1/m_Q corrections. More\nprecise extraction for |V_{cb}| and |V_{ub}| in the HQEFT of QCD is emphasized.\n", "  Using a soft pion theorem based on chiral symmetry and a $\\Delta(1232)$\nresonance model we propose an estimate for the production cross section of low\nenergy pions in the deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) process. In\nparticular, we express the $e p \\to e \\gamma \\pi N$ processes in terms of\ngeneralized parton distributions. We provide estimates of the contamination of\nthe $e p \\to e \\gamma p$ DVCS observables due to this associated pion\nproduction processes when the experimental data are not fully exclusive, for a\nset of kinematical conditions representative of present or planned experiments\nat JLab, HERMES and COMPASS.\n", "  With the known branching ratios of psi(2S) to pi+pi- and psi(2S) to K+K-, the\nbranching ratio of psi(2S) to K0short K0long is calculated as a function of the\nrelative phase between the strong and the electromagnetic amplitudes of the\npsi(2S) decays. The study shows that the branching ratio of psi(2S) to K0short\nK0long is sensitive to the relative phase and a measurement of the K0short\nK0long branching ratio will shed light on the relative phase determination in\npsi(2S) to 0- 0- decays.\n", "  While KamLAND apparently rules out Resonant-Spin-Flavor-Precession (RSFP) as\nan explanation of the solar neutrino deficit, the solar neutrino fluxes in the\nCl and Ga experiments vary with solar rotation rates. Added to this evidence,\nsummarized here, a power spectrum analysis of the Super-Kamiokande data reveals\n(99.9% CL) an oscillation in the band of twice the equatorial rotation\nfrequencies of the solar interior. An m=2 magnetic structure and RSFP, perhaps\nas a subdominant process, would give this effect. Solar cycle data changes are\nseen, as expected for convection zone modulations.\n", "  The apparent discrepancy between the Rosenbluth and the polarization transfer\nmethod for the ratio of the electric to magnetic proton form factors can be\nexplained by a two-photon exchange correction which does not destroy the\nlinearity of the Rosenbluth plot. Though intrinsically small, of the order of a\nfew percent of the cross section, this correction is kinematically enhanced in\nthe Rosenbluth method while it is small for the polarization transfer method,\nat least in the range of (Q^2) where it has been used until now.\n", "  We consider the effects of the Faddeev-Popov determinant in the Coulomb gauge\non the confinement properties of the QCD vacuum. We show that the the\ndeterminant is needed to regularize the otherwise divergent functional\nintegrals near the Gribov horizon but still enables large field configurations\nto generate IR enhanced running coupling. The physical gluon propagator is\nfound to be strongly suppressed in the\n  IR consistent with expectations from lattice gauge calculations.\n", "  The spectrum and the mixing angle of the light scalar nonet mesons are\nstudied using the extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model as well as the\nimproved ladder approximation (ILA) of QCD with U_A(1) symmetry breaking\ninteraction. The U_A(1) breaking is represented by the Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t\nHooft (KMT) interaction. The strength of the KMT interaction in the NJL model\nis determined so as to reproduce the electromagnetic decays of the \\eta meson.\nThat in the ILA approach is determined so as to reproduce the pseudoscalar\nmeson spectrum.\n  In the extended NJL model, we study the qualitative features of the scalar\nmeson spectrum. In the scalar nonet spectrum, the KMT interaction is found to\ngive the right ordering of \\sigma - a_0 masses and a few hundred MeV mass\ndifference between the \\sigma and a_0 mesons. We also find that the strangeness\ncontent in the \\sigma meson is about 15%.\n  In the ILA approach, we confirm the qualitative features of the results from\nthe extended NJL. We obtain the mass spectra of the light pseudoscalar nonet\nmesons and the \\sigma, a_0 mesons which are consistent with current\nexperimental data. On the other hand, we show that the obtained f_0 and K_0^*\nstate can not be identified directly with the experimental data. It may suggest\nthat the f_0(980) and \\kappa(700-900) states may not be explained only by the\nquark-anti quark state.\n  We also find that the strangeness content in the \\sigma meson is about 5%. We\nobtain the result that the U_A(1) breaking interaction reproducing the mass\nspectrum of the pseudoscalar meson gives large effects on the scalar meson mass\nspectrum.\n", "  Interactions of heavy Majorana neutrinos in the thermal phase of the early\nuniverse may be the origin of the cosmological matter-antimatter asymmetry.\nSuccessful baryogenesis, independent of initial conditions, is possible for\nneutrino masses in the range $10^{-3} {eV} \\leq m_i \\lesssim 0.1$ eV.\nRemarkably, this mass window is consistent with the evidence for neutrino\nmasses from oscillations.\n", "  The NuTeV experiment has measured sin^2Theta_W = 0.2277 +/- 0.0013(stat) +/-\n0.0009(syst), approximately 3 standard deviations above the standard model\nprediction. This discrepancy has motivated speculation that the NuTeV result\nmay be affected significantly by neglected experimental or theoretical effects.\nWe examine the case for a number of proposed explanations.\n", "  This brief and opinionated essay evolved from my closing talk at the Tenth\nInternational Workshop on Neutrino Telescopes, held in Venice in March 2003.\nPortions were inspired by several excellent presentations at the Workshop.\nOther scattered comments about neutrino physics relate to variations of the\nseesaw model yielding the FGY ansatz, or to those yielding significant\nsuppressive mixing of neutrino amplitudes.\n", "  Central production cross-sections of hard dijets with 2,1 or 0 rapidity gap\nat Tevatron are analyzed in terms of diffractive (``a la Good-Walker'') and non\ndiffractive fluctuations of the incident particles. The observed large\nfactorization breaking and the unexpected high value of the 2 to 1 gap\ncross-section ratio are explained in terms of scattering with and between the\nincident particles.\n", "  After discussing conceptual problems with the conventional string model, we\npresent a new approach, based on a theoretically consistent multiple scattering\nformalism.\n  First results for proton-proton scattering at 158 GeV are discussed.\n", "  The CMS detector is mainly designed to investigate hard events.\n  Only few Level-1 Trigger conditions are suitable to select soft B-meson\ndecays. The B-physics potential of CMS depends strongly on a selection strategy\nat High-Level Trigger. The selection algorithms for some benchmark\n  B-decay channels that allow CMS to perform competitive B-physics program are\npresented.\n", "  The light-cone wave function of the nucleon is calculated in the limit\n  N_c -> infinity in the quark-soliton model inspired by the theory of the\ninstanton vacuum of QCD. The technique of the finite time evolution operator is\nused in order to derive expressions for all components of the Fock vector\ndescribing the nucleon in the infinite momentum frame. It is shown that nucleon\nwave function for large N_c can be expressed in terms of the wave function of\nthe discrete level in the self-consistent meson field and light cone wave\nfunctions of 1,2, etc mesons. The 3-quark components of the nucleon and\nDelta-resonance are estimated. Wave function of the nucleon appears to be\npositive in the whole region of x and it has rather small asymmetry. It differs\nstrongly both from Chernyak-Zhitnitsky wave function and the asymptotic one.\nLarge momentum transfer asymptotic of the electromagnetic and axial form\nfactors is discussed.\n", "  The results of SIDIS experiments concerning the first moments of the\npolarized quark distributions are considered. The possible reasons of the\ndeviation from the fundamental restrictions such as the Bjorken sum rule and\nthe ways to properly improve the analysis of measured SIDIS asymmetries are\ndiscussed. The possibility of broken polarized sea scenario is analysed.\n", "  This paper studies models with extended electroweak gauge sectors of the form\nSU(2) x SU(2) x U(1) x [SU(2) or U(1)]. We establish the general behavior of\ncorrections to precision electroweak observables in this class of theories and\nconnect our results to previous work on specific models whose electroweak\nsectors are special cases of our extended group.\n", "  We have investigated the present renormalization prescriptions of the\nCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark mixing matrix. Based on one prescription\nwhich is formulated by comparing with the fictitious case of no mixing of quark\ngenerations, we propose a new prescription which can make the physical\namplitude involving quark's mixing gauge independent and ultraviolet finite.\nCompared with the previous prescriptions this prescription is very simple and\nsuitable for actual calculations. Through analytical calculations we also give\na strong Proof for the important hypothesis that in order to keep the CKM\nmatrix gauge independent the unitarity of the CKM matrix must be preserved.\n", "  We argue that although at asymptotically high temperatures the QGP in bulk\nbehaves as a gas of weakly interacting quasiparticles (modulo long-range\nmagnetism), at temperatures up to few times the critical temperature $T_c$ it\ndisplays different properties. If the running of the QCD coupling constant\ncontinues in the Coulomb phase till the screening length scale, it reaches the\nstrong coupling treshold $\\alpha_s(m_D)\\sim 1$. As a result, the Coulomb phase\nsupports weakly bound Coulombic s-wave $\\bar c c$, light quark and even $gg$\nstates.\n  The existence of shallow bound states dramatically increases the\nquasiparticle rescattering at low energies, reducing the viscosity and thereby\nexplaining why heavy ion collisions at RHIC exhibit robust collective\nphenomena. In conformal gauge theories at finite temperature the Coulomb\nbinding persists further in the strong coupling regime, as found for ${\\cal\nN}=4$ SUSY YM in the Maldacena regime.\n", "  Supersymmetry with broken R-parity can explain the neutrino mass squared\ndifferences and mixing angles observed in neutrino oscillation experiments. In\nthe minimal model, where R-parity is broken only by bilinear terms, certain\ndecay properties of the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) are correlated\nwith neutrino mixing angles. Here we consider charginos, squarks, gluinos and\nsneutrinos being the LSP and calculate their decay properties in bilinear\nR-parity breaking supersymmetry. Together with the decays of charged scalars\nand neutralinos calculated previously this completes the proof that bilinear\nR-parity breaking as the source of neutrino masses will be testable at future\ncolliders. Moreover, we argue that in case of GMSB, the decays of the NLSP can\nbe used to test the model.\n", "  We study the effective chiral Lagrangian in the chiral limit from the\ninstanton vacuum. Starting from the nonlocal effective chiral action, we derive\nthe effective chiral Lagrangian, using the derivative expansion to order\n$O(p^4)$ in the chiral limit. The low energy constants, $L_1$, $L_2$, and $L_3$\nare determined and compared with various models and the corresponding empirical\ndata. The results are in a good agreement with the data. We also discuss about\nthe upper limit of the sigma meson, based on the present results.\n", "  It is shown that quarks and leptons can couple intrinsically to pure\nsupergravity, preserving for this context the degeneracy of globally\nsupersymmetric vacua, and specifically preserving the vacuum that is\ncharacterized by SU(4)XU(1). A fundamental representation of SUSY SU(4)XU(1) is\nconstructed in terms of quarks, and it is demonstrated that the symmetry of\nthis fundamental representation is invariant under supergravity interactions\nthat produce quark-lepton transitions. The importance of this tensorial flavor\nstructure is that it predicts a new, seventh quark of charge -1/3, a\nleft-handed (non-strange) version of the strange quark.\n", "  We investigate the physics potential of the annihilation decays\n$\\bar{B}^0_{s,d} \\to J/\\psi$ $\\gamma$ in the Standard Model and beyond. In\nnaive factorization approach, the branching ratios are estimated to be\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\bar{B}^0_s \\to J/\\psi\\gamma)=1.40\\times 10^{-6}$ and\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\bar{B}^0_d \\to J/\\psi\\gamma)=5.29\\times 10^{-8}$. In the\nframework of QCD factorization, we compute the non-factorizable corrections and\nget $\\mathcal{B}(\\bar{B}^0_s \\to J/\\psi\\gamma) = 2.11\\times10^{-7}$,\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\bar{B}^0_d \\to J/\\psi\\gamma) =7.65\\times10^{-9}$. Future\nmeasurements of these decays would be useful for testing the factorization\nframeworks. The smallness of these decays in the SM make them sensitive probes\nof New Physics. As an example, we will consider the possible admixture of (V+A)\ncharge current to the standard (V-A) current. This admixture will give\nsignificant contributions to the decays.\n", "  The Standard-Model interpretation of the ratios of charged and neutral B-> pi\nK rates, R_c and R_n, respectively, points towards a puzzling picture. Since\nthese observables are affected significantly by colour-allowed electroweak (EW)\npenguins, this ``B -> pi K puzzle'' could be a manifestation of new physics in\nthe EW penguin sector. Performing the analysis in the R_n-R_c plane, which is\nvery suitable for monitoring various effects, we demonstrate that we may, in\nfact, move straightforwardly to the experimental region in this plane through\nan enhancement of the relevant EW penguin parameter q. We derive analytical\nbounds for q in terms of a quantity L, that measures the violation of the\nLipkin sum rule, and point out that strong phases around 90 deg are favoured by\nthe data, in contrast to QCD factorisation. The B -> pi K modes imply a\ncorrelation between q and the angle gamma that in the limit of negligible\nrescattering effects and colour suppressed EW penguins depends only on the\nvalue of L. Concentrating on a minimal flavour-violating new-physics scenario\nwith enhanced Z^0 penguins, we find that the current experimental values on\n  B -> X_s mu^+ mu^- require roughly L <= 1.8. As the B -> pi K data give L =\n5.7 +- 2.4, L has either to move to smaller values once the B -> pi K data\nimprove or new sources of flavour and CP violation are needed. In turn, the\nenhanced values of L seen in the B -> pi K data could be accompanied by\nenhanced branching ratios for rare decays. Most interesting turns out to be the\ncorrelation between the B -> pi K modes and BR(K^+ -> pi^+ nu nu), with the\nlatter depending approximately on a single ``scaling'' variable \\bar L= L\n(|V_{ub}/V_{cb}|/0.086)^2.3.\n", "  Two new observations have strengthened the case for the supersymmetric nature\nof the Cold Dark Matter component in our universe: First, it was shown that new\ndata on the nuclear abundance, B/C - and 10Be/9Be ratios constrain the\ndiffusion parameters in Galactic Models so strongly, that they lead to a clear\ndeficiency in the production of diffuse hard gamma rays, antiprotons and hard\npositrons, if no anomalous sources or anomalous energy dependence of the\ndiffusion coefficients are postulated. Second, from the precise relic density\nmeasurement by WMAP the WIMP annihilation cross section can be determined in a\nmodel independent way. If the WIMPS are postulated to be the neutralinos of\nSupersymmetry, then only a limited region of parameter space matches this\nannihilation cross section. It is shown that the resulting positrons,\nantiprotons and gamma rays from the neutralino annihilation (mainly into\nb-quarks) provide the correct shape and magnitude for the missing fluxes in the\nGalactic Models.\n  The probability of a global fit to the galactic spectra of diffuse gamma\nrays, positrons and antiprotons improves from about 10^{-8} to 0.5, if Dark\nMatter, as predicted by Supersymmetry,is taken into account. This corresponds\nto about 6 sigma evidence for the supersymmetric nature of Dark Matter in case\nof Gaussian errors.\n", "  We present the loop-loop correlation model that allows us to compute\nconfining flux tubes and to examine their effects and manifestations in\nhigh-energy reactions.\n", "  We study excited baryon decay widths in large N_c QCD. It was suggested\npreviously that some spin-flavor mixed-symmetric baryon states have strong\ncouplings of O(N_c^{-1/2}) to nucleons [implying narrow widths of O(1/N_c)], as\nopposed to the generic expectation based on Witten's counting rules of an\nO(N_c^0) coupling. The calculation obtaining these narrow widths was performed\nin the context of a simple quark-shell model. This paper addresses the question\nof whether the existence of such narrow states is a general property of large\nN_c QCD. We show that a general large N_c QCD analysis does not predict such\nnarrow states; rather they are a consequence of the extreme simplicity of the\nquark model.\n", "  We develop a general numerical method aimed at studying particle production\nfrom vacuum states in a variety of settings. As a first example we look at\nparticle production in a simple cosmological model. We apply the same approach\nto the dynamical Casimir effect, with special focus on the case of an\noscillating mirror. We confirm previous estimates and obtain long-time\nproduction rates and particle spectra for both resonant and off-resonant\nfrequencies. Finally, we simulate a system with space and time-dependent\noptical properties, analogous to a one-dimensional expanding dielectric bubble.\n  We obtain simple expressions for the dependence of the final particle number\non the expansion velocity and final dielectric constant.\n", "  We describe a recently developed heavy-light chiral quark model and show how\nit can be used to calculate decay amplitudes for heavy mesons. In particular,\nwe discuss B- antiB mixing, B -> D antiD, B -> D eta' and the beta term for D*\n-> D gamma .\n", "  We report on the progress in work on improving precision of the standard\nmodel theoretical predictions for the top quark pair production and decay into\nsix fermions at a linear collider. Two programs have been combined into a\nsingle Monte Carlo program: 'eett6f', a MC program for e+e- -> 6f, and\n'topfit', a program for electroweak radiative corrections to e+e- -> t\\bar t.\nThe MC program is described and preliminary numerical results are shown.\n", "  This note will be part of Chapter 6.5 of the ALICE Physics Performance Report\n(PPR), \"ALICE Physics: Charm and Beauty\", where the capabilities of ALICE for\nthe detection of open heavy flavour particles will be described.\n  We define here the present ALICE baseline for what concerns the heavy flavour\nproduction cross sections at LHC and the kinematical distributions of the heavy\nquark pairs. We start by qualitatively assessing the Bjorken x regimes\naccessible with charm and beauty measurements at LHC with ALICE (Section 1). In\nSection 2 we report the most recent results (and the uncertainties) of the\nnext-to-leading order (NLO) pQCD calculations for the cross sections in pp\ncollisions at LHC energies. These results are extrapolated to Pb-Pb collisions\nin Section 3.1 and to p-Pb collisions in Section 3.2, taking into account\nnuclear shadowing and parton intrinsic transverse momentum broadening.Heavy\nquark kinematics as given by the NLO pQCD calculation are reported in Section\n4. We tuned the PYTHIA event generator in order to reproduce such results for\nwhat concerns the c and b quarks transverse momentum distributions (Section 5).\nFinally, we report the yields and transverse momentum distributions for D and B\nmesons (Section 6).\n", "  In the chiral quark soliton model the smallness of $\\Theta^+$ width is due to\nthe cancellation of the coupling constants which are of different order in\n$N_c$. We show that taking properly into account the flavor structure of\nrelevant SU(3) representations for arbitrary number of colors enahnces the\nnonleading term by an additional factor of $N_c$, making the cancellation\nconsistent with the $N_c$ counting. Moreover, we show that, for the same\nreason, $\\Theta^+$ width is suppressed by a group-theoretical factor ${\\cal\nO}(1/N_c)$ with respect to $\\Delta$ and discuss the $N_c$ dependence of the\nphase space factors for these two decays.\n", "  The behaviour of the broken CP symmetry at finite temperature is examined.\nThis is achieved through the investigation of the neutron electric dipole\nmoment $d_n$ induced by $\\theta$-term.\n  By using thermal QCD sum rules, we find that below the critical temperature,\nthe ratio $\\mid {d_n \\over \\bar{\\theta}}\\mid$ slightly decreases but survives\nat temperature effects. This evolution implies that CP remains broken at finite\ntemperature as required by Baryogenesis \\cite{Chabab}.\n", "  The phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking admits a physical\ninterpretation in terms of the Bose-condensation process of elementary spinless\nquanta. In this picture, the broken-symmetry phase emerges as a real physical\nmedium, endowed with a hierarchical pattern of scales, supporting two types of\nelementary excitations for k \\to 0: a massive energy branch E_a(k) \\to M_H,\ncorresponding to the usual Higgs boson field, and a collective gap-less branch\nE_b(k) \\to 0. This is similar to the coexistence of phonons and rotons in\nsuperfluid He-4 that, in fact, is usually considered the condensed-matter\nanalog of the Higgs condensate.\n  After previous work dedicated to the properties of the gap-less, phonon\nbranch, in this paper we use quantum hydrodynamics to propose a physical\ninterpretation of the massive branch. On the base of our results, M_H coincides\nwith the energy-gap for vortex formation and a massive Higgs boson is like a\nroton in superfluid He-4. Within this interpretation of the Higgs particle,\nthere is no \"naturalness\" problem since M_H remains a naturally intermediate,\nfixed energy scale, even for an ultimate ultraviolet cutoff Lambda \\to \\infty.\n", "  In this letter we present a high-precision evaluation of the expansions in\neps=(3-d)/2 of (up to) four-loop scalar vacuum master integrals, using the\nmethod of difference equations developed by Laporta. We cover the complete set\nof fully massive master integrals.\n", "  Starting with the basic Lagrangian of the Standard Model, the radiative\ncorrections to the neutron beta-decay are acquired. The electroweak\ninteractions are consistently taken into consideration amenably to the\nWeinberg-Salam theory. The effect of the strong quark-quark interactions on the\nneutron beta-decay is parameterized by introducing the nucleon electromagnetic\nform factors and the nucleon weak transition current specified by the form\nfactors g_V, g_A, ... The radiative corrections to the total decay probability\nW and to the asymmetry coefficient of the electron momentum distribution A\nobtained to constitute \\delta W = 8.7%, \\delta A = -2% . The contribution to\nthe radiative corrections due to allowance for the nucleon form factors and the\nnucleon exited states amounts up to a few per cent to the whole value of the\nradiative corrections. The ambiguity in description of the nucleon\ncompositeness is this surely what causes the uncertainties ~0.1% in evaluation\nof the neutron beta-decay characteristics. For now, this puts bounds to the\nprecision attainable in obtaining the element V_ud of the CKM matrix and the\ng_V, g_A, ... values from experimental data processing.\n", "  Black hole production in elementary particle collisions is among the most\npromising probes of large extra spacetime dimensions. Studies of black holes at\nparticle colliders have assumed that all of the incoming energy is captured in\nthe resulting black hole. We incorporate the inelasticity inherent in such\nprocesses and determine the prospects for discovering black holes in colliders\nand cosmic ray experiments, employing a dynamical model of Hawking evolution.\nAt the Large Hadron Collider, inelasticity reduces rates by factors of 10^3 to\n10^6 in the accessible parameter space, moderating, but not eliminating, hopes\nfor black hole discovery. At the Pierre Auger Observatory, rates are suppressed\nby a factor of 10. We evaluate the impact of cosmic ray observations on\ncollider prospects.\n", "  Explicit expressions for the non-singlet and singlet structure functions g_1\nat the small $x$-region are obtained. They include the total resummation of\ndouble-logarithmic contributions and accounting for the running QCD coupling\neffects. We predict that both the non-singlet and singlet g_1 asymptotically ~\nx^{- \\Delta}, with the singlet intercept\n  = 0.86 and being more than twice larger than the non-singlet intercept = 0.4.\nThe impact of the initial quark and gluon densities on the sign of g_1 at x <<\n1 is discussed.\n", "  We demonstrate how the interplay of a future e^+e^- LC at its first stage\nwith sqrt{s} sim 500 GeV and of the LHC could lead to a precise determination\nof the fundamental SUSY parameters in the gaugino/higgsino sector without\nassuming a specific supersymmetry breaking scheme. We demonstrate this for the\nbenchmark scenario SPS1a, taking into account realistic errors for the masses\nand cross sections measured at the LC with polarised beams, including errors\ncoming from polarisation measurements, and mass measurements at the LHC. The\nresults clearly demonstrate the complementarity of the LHC and LC, and the\nbenefit from the joint analyses of their data.\n", "  We discuss the renormalization of \\Phi-derivable approximations for scalar\nfield theories. In such approximations, the self-energy is obtained as the\nsolution of a self-consistent equation which effectively resums infinite\nsubsets of diagrams of perturbation theory. We show that a consistent\nrenormalization can be carried out, and we provide an explicit construction of\nthe counterterms needed to eliminate the subdivergences. The counterterms are\ncalculated from the solution of an auxiliary gap equation which determines the\nleading asymptotic part of the self-energy. This auxiliary gap equation may be\nchosen as the gap equation of the massless theory at zero temperature. We\nverify explicitly that the counterterms determined at zero temperature are\nsufficient to eliminate the divergences which occur in finite temperature\ncalculations.\n", "  A fictitious discussion is taken as a point of origin to present novel\nphysical insight into the nature of gauge theory and the potential energy of\nQCD and QED at short distance. Emphasized is the considerable freedom in the\ncut-off function which eventually can modify the Coulomb potential of two\ncharges at sufficiently small distances. Emphasized is also that the parameters\nof the regularization function (the ``cut-off scale'') should not be driven to\ninfinity but kept constant in line with the modern interpretation of\nrenormalization theory. The paper restricts to general aspects. The technical\nparaphernalia and the comparison with experiment are shifted to a sequence of 4\nsubsequent stand-alone and sufficiently small papers to be published\nimmediatelely hereafter.\n", "  We study the phenomenology of a 5D $SU(3)_W$ model on a $S_1/(Z_2\\times\nZ'_2)$ orbifold in which the minimal scalar sector plays an essential role of\nradiatively generating neutrino Majorana masses without the benefits of\nright-handed singlets. We carefully examine how do the exotic scalars affect\nthe renormalization group (RG) equations for the gauge couplings and the 5D\n$SU(3)_W$ unification. We found that the compactification scale of extra\ndimension is in the range of $1/R\\sim 1.5-5$ TeV. The possibility of the\nexistence of relatively low mass Kaluza-Klein excitations makes the\nphenomenology of near term interest. Some possible bilepton signatures can be\nsearched for in future colliders and in neutrino scattering experiments with\nintense neutrino beams. The low energy constraints from muon physics and lepton\nnumber violating decay process induced by bilepton are also discussed.\n  These constraints can provide new information on the structure of Yukawa\ncouplings which might be useful for future model building.\n", "  In this article, with the assumption of explicit isospin violation arising\nfrom the $f_0(980)-a_0(980)$ mixing, we take the point of view that the scalar\nmesons $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ have both strange and non-strange\nquark-antiquark components and evaluate the strong coupling constants $g_{f_0\nK^+ K^-}$ and $g_{a_0 K^+ K^-}$ within the framework of the light-cone QCD sum\nrules approach. The large strong scalar-$KK$ couplings through both the\n$n\\bar{n}$ and $s\\bar{s}$ components $g^{\\bar{n}n}_{f_0 K^+ K^-}$,\n$g^{\\bar{s}s}_{f_0 K^+ K^-}$,\n  $g^{\\bar{n}n}_{a_0 K^+ K^-}$ and $g^{\\bar{s}s}_{a_0 K^+ K^-}$will support the\nhadronic dressing mechanism, furthermore, in spite of the constituent structure\ndifferences between the $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ mesons, the strange\ncomponents have larger strong coupling constants with the $K^+K^-$ state than\nthe corresponding non-strange ones, $g_{f_0 K^+ K^-}^{\\bar{s}s}\\approx\n\\sqrt{2}g_{f_0 K^+ K^-}^{\\bar{n}n}$ and $g_{a_0 K^+ K^-}^{\\bar{s}s}\\approx\n\\sqrt{2} g_{a_0 K^+ K^-}^{\\bar{n}n}$. From the existing controversial values,\nwe can not reach a general consensus on the strong coupling constants $g_{f_0\nK^+ K^-}$, $g_{a_0 K^+ K^-}$ and the mixing angles.\n", "  Electroproduction of two vector mesons with a large rapidity gap between them\nprovides the first feasible selective access to chiral-odd GPDs.\n  The scattering amplitude of the process $ \\gamma ^* N \\to \\rho_L^0 \\rho_T^+\nN'$ may be represented as a convolution of an impact factor describing the\n$\\gamma ^* \\to \\rho_L^0$ transition and an amplitude describing the $N\\to\n\\rho_T^+ N'$ transition, analogously to deeply exclusive electroproduction of a\nmeson, the virtual photon being replaced by a Pomeron. The production of a\ntransversely polarized vector meson $\\rho_T^+$ selects a chiral-odd GPD in the\nproton.\n", "  A pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson as curvaton avoids the eta-problem of\ninflation which plagues most curvaton candidates. We point out that a concrete\nrealization of the curvaton mechanism with a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson can\nbe found in the supersymmetric Peccei-Quinn mechanism resolving the strong CP\nproblem. In the flaton models of Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking, the angular\ndegree of freedom associated with the QCD axion can naturally be a flat\ndirection during inflation and provides successful curvature perturbations. In\nthis scheme, the preferred values of the axion scale and the Hubble parameter\nduring inflation turn out to be about 10^{10} GeV and 10^{12} GeV,\nrespectively. Moreover, it is found that a significant isocurvature component,\n(anti)correlated to the overall curvature perturbation, can be generated, which\nis a smoking-gun for the curvaton scenario. Finally, non-Gaussianity in the\nperturbation spectrum at potentially observable level is also possible.\n", "  We construct an anomaly free supersymmetric U(1)' model with a secluded\nU(1)'-breaking sector. We study the one-loop effective potential at finite\ntemperature, and show that there exists a strong enough first order electroweak\nphase transition for electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) because of the large\ntrilinear term $A_h h S H_d H_u$ in the tree-level Higgs potential. Unlike in\nthe MSSM, the lightest stop can be very heavy. We consider the non-local EWBG\nmechanism in the thin wall regime, and find that within uncertainties the\nobserved baryon number can be generated from the $\\tau$ lepton contribution,\nwith the secluded sector playing an essential role. The chargino and neutralino\ncontributions and the implications for the Z' mass and electric dipole moments\nare briefly discussed.\n", "  Minimal $S_{3}$ invariant Higgs potential with real soft $S_{3}$ breaking\nmasses is investigated.\n  It is required that without having a problem with triviality, all physical\nHiggs bosons, except one neutral one, become heavy ~O(10) TeV in order to\nsufficiently suppress flavor changing neutral currents. There exist three\nnonequivalent soft mass terms that can be characterized according to their\ndiscrete symmetries, and the one which breaks $S_{3}$ completely. The $S_{2}'$\ninvariant vacuum expectation values (VEVs) of the Higgs fields are the most\neconomic VEVs in the sense that the freedom of VEVs can be completely absorbed\ninto the Yukawa couplings so that it is possible to derive, without referring\nto the details of the VEVs, the most general form for the fermion mass matrices\nin minimal $S_{3}$ extension of the standard model. We find that except for the\ncompletely broken case of the soft terms, the $S_{2}'$ invariant VEVs are\nunique VEVs that satisfy the requirement of heavy Higgs bosons. It is found\nthat they also correspond to a local minimum in the completely broken case.\n", "  We present a new supersymmetric extension of the standard model. The model is\nconstructed in warped space, with a unified bulk symmetry broken by boundary\nconditions on both the Planck and TeV branes. In the supersymmetric limit, the\nmassless spectrum contains exotic colored particles along with the particle\ncontent of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). Nevertheless, the\nmodel still reproduces the MSSM prediction for gauge coupling unification and\ndoes not suffer from a proton decay problem. The exotic states acquire masses\nfrom supersymmetry breaking, making the model completely viable, but there is\nstill the possibility that these states will be detected at the LHC. The\nlightest of these states is most likely A_5^XY, the fifth component of the\ngauge field associated with the broken unified symmetry. Because supersymmetry\nis broken on the SU(5)-violating TeV brane, the gaugino masses generated at the\nTeV scale are completely independent of one another. We explore some of the\nunusual features that the superparticle spectrum might have as a consequence.\n", "  In this article, we investigate the structures of the pseudoscalar mesons\n($\\pi$, $K$, $D$, $D_s$, $B$ and $B_s$) in the framework of the coupled rainbow\nSchwinger-Dyson equation and ladder\n  Bethe-Salpeter equation with the confining effective potential (infrared\nmodified flat bottom potential).\n  The Schwinger-Dyson functions for the $u$, $d$ and $s$ quarks are greatly\nrenormalized at small momentum region and the curves are steep at about\n$q^2=1GeV^2$ which indicates an explicitly dynamical symmetry breaking. The\nEuclidean time fourier transformed quark propagators have no mass poles in the\ntime-like region which naturally implements confinement. As for the $c$ and $b$\nquarks, the current masses are very large, the renormalization are more tender,\nhowever, mass poles in the time-like region are also absent. The Bethe-Salpeter\nwavefunctions for those mesons have the same type (Gaussian type) momentum\ndependence and center around small momentum which indicate that the bound\nstates exist in the infrared region. The decay constants for those pseudoscalar\nmesons are compatible with the values of experimental extractions and\ntheoretical calculations, such as lattice simulations and QCD sum rules.\n", "  Demonstration of how matter effects can result into non-oscillating neutrinos\nin vacuum, after they have passed through an appropriate distribution of\nmatter.\n  A brief discussion about matter effects in neutrinos oscillation is also\nmade.\n", "  In this work, we evaluate the energy spectra of baryons which consist of two\nheavy and one light quarks in the MIT bag model. The two heavy quarks\nconstitute a heavy scalar or axial vector diquark. Concretely, we calculate the\nspectra of $|q(QQ')>_{1/2}$ and $|q(QQ')>_{3/2}$ where $Q$ and $Q'$ stand for\n$b$ and/or $c$ quarks. Especially, for $|q(bc)>_{1/2}$ there can be a mixing\nbetween $|q(bc)_0>_{1/2}$ and $|q(bc)_1>_{1/2}$ where the subscripts 0 and 1\nrefer to the spin state of the diquark (bc), the mixing is not calculable in\nthe framework of quantum mechanics (QM) as the potential model is employed, but\ncan be evaluated by the quantum field theory (QFT). Our numerical results\nindicate that the mixing is sizeable\n", "  The triumphs of the Standard Model of Particle Physics call attention upon an\nold idea, that the so-called vacuum is an accessible physical medium, and not\njust a tautology.\n  I take this idea as a serious working hypothesis, and I suggest a new way of\ntrying to define and understand the structure of the light quark vacuum within\nthe general framework of the Standard Model.\n", "  We present the Monte-Carlo events Data Base (MCDB) project and its\ndevelopment plans. MCDB facilitates communication between authors of\nMonte-Carlo generators and experimental users. It also provides a convenient\nbook-keeping and an easy access to generator level samples. The first release\nof MCDB is now operational for the CMS collaboration. In this paper we review\nthe main ideas behind MCDB and discuss future plans to develop this Data Base\nfurther within the CERN LCG framework.\n", "  Constraint of prompt photon data on the polarized gluon distribution is\ndiscussed in terms of uncertainty estimation for polarized parton distribution\nfunctions (PDFs). By comparing between uncertainty of the double spin asymmetry\nA_{LL}^\\gamma and expected statistical errors at RHIC, we found that the gluon\ndistribution is effectively constrained in the region 0.04<x_{_T}<0.2 with the\ndata at transverse momentum p_{_T}=10-20 GeV for center-of-mass energies\n\\sqrt{s}=200 and 500 GeV.\n", "  It is well known how multiplicative renormalizability of the fermion\npropagator, through its Schwinger-Dyson equation, imposes restrictions on the\n3-point fermion-boson vertex in massless quenched quantum electrodynamics in\n4-dimensions (QED$_4$). Moreover, perturbation theory serves as an excellent\nguide for possible nonperturbative constructions of Green functions.\n  We extend these ideas to arbitrary dimensions $d$. The constraint of\nmultiplicative renormalizability of the fermion propagator is generalized to a\nLandau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin transformation law in $d$-dimensions and it\nnaturally leads to a constraint on the fermion-boson vertex. We verify that\nthis constraint is satisfied in perturbation theory at the one loop level in\n3-dimensions. Based upon one loop perturbative calculation of the vertex, we\nfind additional restrictions on its possible nonperturbative forms in arbitrary\ndimensions.\n", "  Radiation from high energy electrons in an oriented crystal can be considered\nin a frame of the quasiclassical operator method which appears to be a most\nsatisfactory approach to the problem. Under some quite generic assumptions the\ngeneral expression is derived for the probability of circularly polarized\nphoton emission from the longitudinally polarized electron in oriented crystal.\nThe particular mechanism of radiation depends on interrelation between the\nangle of incidence $\\vartheta_0$ (angle between the momentum of initial\nelectron and axis (plane) of crystal) and angle $\\vartheta_v \\equiv V_0/m$\n($V_0$ is the scale of a potential of axis or a plane relative to which the\nangle $\\vartheta_0$ is defined). When $\\vartheta_0 \\ll \\vartheta_v$ one has\nmagnetic bremsstrahlung type of radiation (with corrections $\\propto\n\\vartheta_0^2$ which are due to inhomogeneous character of field in crystal).\nWhen $\\vartheta_0 \\gg \\vartheta_v$ one obtains the theory of coherent\nbremsstrahlung, while for $\\vartheta_0 \\geq \\vartheta_v$ one arrives to the\nmodified theory of coherent bremsstrahlung. At high energy radiation in\noriented crystals is strongly enhanced comparing with standard bremsstrahlung.\n", "  The recently observed pentaquark baryons $\\Theta^{+}$ and $\\Xi^{--}$ are\nstudied in the dual gravity theory of QCD.\n  By developing a general formulation useful for studying the branched string\nweb in a curved space, simple mass formulae of the pentaquark baryons are\nderived in the Maldacena prototype model for supersymmetric QCD and a more\nrealistic model for ordinary QCD. Even though the approximations adopted here\nin deriving these formulae are extremely naive, the predicted values of the\nmasses do not differ significantly from their experimental values. We thus\nconclude that this approach is promising for the purpose of obtaining a\ndescription of the observed masses of pentaquarks and of their extremely narrow\ndecay widths. With the aim of constructing more reliable mass formulae, a\npreliminary sketch is given of how spin, the hyperfine interaction and parity\nare considered in the string picture.\n", "  The Collins mechanism provides a non-perturbative explanation for the large\nsingle spin asymmetries found in hard semi-inclusive reactions involving a\ntransversely polarized nucleon. However, there are seemingly convincing reasons\nto suspect that the mechanism vanishes, and indeed it does vanish in the naive\nparton model where a quark is regarded as an essentially 'free' particle. We\ngive an intuitive analysis which highlights the difference between the naive\npicture and the realistic one, and shows how the Collins mechanism arises when\nthe quark is described as an off-shell particle by a field in interaction. A\ntypographical error is corrected in this version.\n", "  The gauge dependence of the complex fermion quasiparticle poles corresponding\nto soft collective excitations is studied in hot gauge theories at one-loop\norder and next-to-leading order in the high-temperature expansion, with a view\ntowards going beyond the leading order hard thermal loops and resummations\nthereof. We find that for collective excitations of momenta k ~ eT the\ndispersion relations are gauge independent, but the corresponding damping rates\nare gauge dependent. For k<<eT and in k \\to 0 limit, both the dispersion\nrelations and the damping rates are found to be gauge dependent. The gauge\ndependence of the position of the complex quasiparticle poles signals the need\nfor resummation. Possible cancellation of the leading gauge dependence at\ntwo-loop order in the case of QED is briefly discussed.\n", "  This paper presents the detection issues for the lightest slepton\n\\tilde{\\tau}_1 at a future e^+e^- TeV collider given the dark matter\nconstraints set on the SUSY mass spectrum by the WMAP results. It intends to\nillustrate the importance of an optimal detection of energetic electrons in the\nvery forward region for an efficient rejection of the\n  \\gamma\\gamma background. The TESLA parameters have been used in the case of\nhead-on collisions and in the case of a 10, mrad half crossing angle.\n", "  The requirement that the supersymmetric scalar potential be stable in the\nminimal supergravity (mSUGRA) model imposes an upper bound on the universal\ngaugino mass $m_{1/2}$ as function of the common scalar mass $m_0$. Combining\nthis with the experimental lower bound on $m_{1/2}$ from LEP data, we find a\nnew lower bound on $m_0$, stronger than the one that comes from experimental\ndata alone. If the corresponding upper and lower limits on the superparticle\nmasses, presented in this letter, are found to be violated at Tevatron Run II\nor at the LHC, it would imply that we are living on a false vacuum. Special\nattention has been paid in estimating the uncertainties in these predictions\ndue to the choice of the renormalization scale. The implications of our limits\nfor the constraints obtained by indirect methods(SUSY dark matter, g - 2 of the\nmuon, $ b \\to s \\gamma$....) are briefly discussed.\n", "  We study how we can understand the change of the spectral function and the\npole location of the correlation function for sigma at finite temperature,\nwhich were previously obtained in the linear sigma model with a resummation\ntechnique called optimized perturbation theory. There are two relevant poles in\nthe sigma channel. One pole is the original sigma pole which shows up as a\nbroad peak at zero temperature and becomes lighter as the temperature\nincreases. The behavior is understood from the decreasing of the sigma\ncondensate, which is consistent with the Brown-Rho scaling. The other pole\nchanges from a virtual state to a bound state of pion-pion as the temperature\nincreases which causes the enhancement at the pion-pion threshold. The behavior\nis understood as the emergence of the pion-pion bound state due to the\nenhancement of the pion-pion attraction by the induced emission in medium. The\nlatter pole, not the former, eventually degenerates with pion above the\ncritical temperature of the chiral transition. This means that the observable\n\"sigma\" changes from the former to the latter pole, which can be interpreted as\nthe level crossing of \"sigma\" and pion-pion at finite temperature.\n", "  In soliton models expressed in terms of the non-linear chiral field, the\nelectric current has an anomalous gauge-field contribution as the baryon\ncurrent does. We study the spin polarized Skyrmions coupled with the\nelectromagnetic field via the gauged Wess-Zumino term and calculate\nconfigurations of the Skyrmion and the gauge field with boundary conditions to\nensure the physical charge number for baryons.\n  Although the electromagnetic field via the gauged Wess-Zumino term affects\nphysical quantities in small amounts, we find that the magnetic field forms a\ndipole structure owing to a circular electric current around the spin\nquantization axis of the soliton. This is understood on an analogy with the\nMeissner effect in the super conductor.The electric charge distributions turn\nout to have characteristic structures depending on the total charge, which\nsuggests the intrinsic deformation of baryons due to orbital motions of the\nconstituents.\n", "  This paper contains a detailed analysis of the properties of the scalar\nproduct of short and long living superpositions of neutral $|K_{0}>$,\n$|{\\bar{K}}_{0}>$ mesons. It is shown for the exact effective Hamiltonian for\nneutral meson subsystem that the scalar product of its eigenvectors, which\ncorrespond with these short and long living superpositions, can not be real\nwith the assumption of CPT conserved and CP violated. The standard conclusion\nobtained within the Lee-Oehme-Yang theory of neutral kaons is that in this case\nsuch a product should be real.\n", "  We study the application of the exact renormalisation group to a many-fermion\nsystem with a short-range attractive force. We introduce a boson field to\ndescribe pairing effects, and take a simple ansatz for the effective action. We\nderive a set of approximate flow equations for the effective coupling including\nboson and fermionic fluctuations. The initial conditions are obtained by\nrenormalising the interaction to fit the scattering length in vacuum. At some\ncritical value of the running scale, the numerical solutions show a phase\ntransition to a gapped phase. Standard results are recovered if we omit the\nboson loops. When boson fluctuations are included, we find that their\ncontributions are significant only in the small-gap regime.\n", "  We compare the statistical thermodynamics of hadron resonance gas with recent\nLGT results at finite chemical potential. We argue that for $T\\leq T_c$ the\nequation of state derived from\n  Monte--Carlo simulations of two quark--flavor QCD at finite chemical\npotential is consistent with that of a hadron resonance gas when applying the\nsame set of approximations as used in LGT calculations.\n  We indicate the relation of chemical freezeout conditions obtained from a\ndetailed analysis of particle production in heavy ion collisions with the\ncritical conditions required for deconfinement. We argue that the position of a\nhadron--quark gluon boundary line in temperature chemical potential plane can\nbe determined in terms of the resonance gas model by the condition of fixed\nenergy density.\n", "  Determinations of $\\vud$ and $\\vus$ along with their implications for the\nunitarity test $\\vud^2+\\vus^2+\\vub^2=1$ are discussed. The leading two loop\nradiative corrections to neutron $\\beta$-decay are evaluated and used to derive\na refined relationship $\\vud^2 \\tau_n (1+3g_A^2)=4908(4)$sec. Employing $\\vud\n=0.9740(5)$ from superallowed nuclear decays and the measured neutron lifetime\n$\\tau_n = 885.7(7)$sec, leads to the precise prediction $g_A=1.2703(8)$ which\nis compared with current direct experimental values. Various extractions of\n$\\vus$ are described and updated. The long accepted Particle Data Group value\nof $\\vus$ from fitted $K_{e3}$ decay rates suggests a deviation from CKM\nunitarity but it is contradicted by more recent experimental results which\nconfirm unitarity with good precision.\n  An outlook for possible future advances is given.\n", "  The model of soft diffractive dissociation proposed some time ago by\nMiettinen and Pumplin is shown to describe correctly the data at FERMILAB\nenergies. The comparison with Goulianos model of renor malized pomeron flux is\nalso presented.\n", "  We investigate the thermal relic density of the cold dark matter in the\ncontext of the brane world cosmology. Since the expansion law in a high energy\nregime is modified from the one in the standard cosmology, if the dark matter\ndecouples in such a high energy regime its relic number density is affected by\nthis modified expansion law. We derive analytic formulas for the number density\nof the dark matter. It is found that the resultant relic density is\ncharacterized by the ``transition temperature'' at which the modified expansion\nlaw in the brane world cosmology is connecting with the standard one, and can\nbe considerably enhanced compared to that in the standard cosmology, if the\ntransition temperature is low enough.\n", "  We discuss the associated production of a light Higgs boson and a light\nchargino pair in the process e+e- -> h chi+ chi- in the Minimal\n  Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) at linear colliders (LC) with\n  \\sqrt s=500 GeV. This process gives direct informations about the Higgs-boson\ncoupling to light charginos, that cannot be analyzed in decay processes due to\nphase-space restrictions. We compute total cross sections in the regions of the\nMSSM parameter space where the process cannot proceed via on-shell production\nand subsequent decay of either heavier charginos or pseudoscalar Higgs bosons\nA. Cross sections up to a few 0.1 fb are allowed, making this process\npotentially detectable at high-luminosity linear colliders. We also compute\nanalytically the final h momentum distributions in the limit of very heavy\nelectron-sneutrino masses.\n", "  We study the O(N) linear sigma model in 1+1 dimensions. We use the 2PI\nformalism of Cornwall, Jackiw and Tomboulis in order to evaluate the effective\npotential at finite temperature. At next-to-leading order in a 1/N expansion\none has to include the sums over \"necklace\" and generalized \"sunset\" diagrams.\n  We find that - in contrast to the Hartree approximation - there is no\nspontaneous symmetry breaking in this approximation, as to be expected for the\nexact theory. The effective potential becomes convex throughout for all\nparameter sets which include N=4,10,100, couplings lambda=0.1 and 0.5, and\ntemperatures between 0.2 and 1. The Green's functions obtained by solving the\nSchwinger-Dyson equations are enhanced in the infrared region. We also compare\nthe effective potential as function of the external field phi with those\nobtained in various other approximations.\n", "  We point out the opportunity of the tau neutrino astronomy for the neutrino\nenergy E ranging between 10 GeV and 10^3 GeV. In this energy range, the\nintrinsic tau neutrino production is suppressed relative to the intrinsic muon\nneutrino production. Any sizable tau neutrino flux may thus arise because of\nthe \\nu_{\\mu}\\to \\nu_{\\tau} neutrino oscillations only. It is demonstrated\nthat, in the presence of the neutrino oscillations, consideration of the\nneutrino flavor dependence in the background atmospheric neutrino flux leads to\nthe drastically different prospects between the observation of the\nastrophysical muon neutrinos and that of the astrophysical tau neutrinos.\n  Taking the galactic-plane neutrino flux as the targeted astrophysical source,\nwe have found that the galactic-plane tau neutrino flux dominates over the\natmospheric tau neutrino flux for E > 10 GeV. Hence, the galactic-plane can at\nleast in principle be seen through the tau neutrinos with energies just greater\nthan 10 GeV. In a sharp contrast, the galactic-plane muon neutrino flux is\noverwhelmed by its atmospheric background until E > 10^6 GeV.\n", "  We present a model for next-to-leading order resummed threshold form factors\nbased on a time-like coupling recently introduced in the framework of small x\nphysics. Improved expressions for the form factors in N-space are obtained\nwhich are not plagued by Landau-pole singularities, as the included absorptive\neffects -- usually neglected -- act as regulators. The physical reason is that,\nbecause of faster decay of gluon jets, there is not enough resolution time to\nobserve the Landau pole. Our form factors reduce to the standard ones when the\nabsorptive parts related to the coupling are neglected. The inverse transform\nfrom N-space to x-space can be done directly without any prescription and we\nobtain analytical expressions for the form factors, which are well defined in\nall x-space.\n", "  We study the evolution of flavor-singlet, light-cone amplitudes in the\nsoft-collinear effective theory (SCET), and reproduce results previously\nobtained by a different approach. We apply our calculation to the color-singlet\ncontribution to the photon endpoint in radiative Upsilon decay. In a previous\npaper, we studied the color-singlet contributions to the endpoint, but\nneglected operator mixing, arguing that it should be a numerically small\neffect. Nevertheless the mixing needs to be included in a consistent\ncalculation, and we do just that in this work. We find that the effects of\nmixing are indeed numerically small. This result combined with previous work on\nthe color-octet contribution and the photon fragmentation contribution provides\na consistent theoretical treatment of the photon spectrum in radiative Upsilon\ndecay.\n", "  Analytical methods in heavy quark physics are shortly reviewed, with emphasis\non the problems of dynamical calculations. Then, attention is attracted to the\nvarious difficulties raised by a tentative experimental determination of\n$\\tau_{1/2}$\n", "  We present the GLoBES (``General Long Baseline Experiment Simulator'')\nsoftware package, which allows the simulation of long-baseline and reactor\nneutrino oscillation experiments. One part of the software is the abstract\nexperiment definition language to define experiments with beam and full\ndetector descriptions as accurate as possible. Many systematics options are\nprovided, such as normalization and energy calibration errors, or the choice\nbetween spectral or total rate information. For the definition of experiments,\na new transparent building block concept is introduced. In addition, an\nadditional program provides the possibility to develop and test new experiment\ndefinitions quickly. Another part of GLoBES is the user's interface, which\nprovides probability, rate, and $\\Delta \\chi^2$ information for a given\nexperiment or any combination of up to 32 experiments in C. Especially, the\n$\\Delta \\chi^2$ functions allow a simulation with statistics only, systematics,\ncorrelations, and degeneracies. In particular, GLoBES can handle the full\nmulti-parameter correlation among the oscillation parameters, external input,\nand matter density uncertainties.\n", "  The pentaquarks are exotic baryons formed of four quarks and an antiquarks.\nTheir existence has been discussed in the literature over the last 30 years or\nmore, first in connection with kaon nucleon scattering data. The subject has\nbeen revived by the end of 2002 when experimental evidence of a narrow baryon\nof strangeness $S$ = + 1, and mass $M \\simeq$ 1530 MeV has been found. This is\ninterpreted as the lightest member of an SU(3)-flavor antidecuplet. Here we\nshall mainly review the predictions of pentaquark properties as e.g. mass, spin\nand parity, within constituent quark models.\n  Both light and heavy pentaquarks will be presented.\n", "  We discuss about a possibility of large electroweak penguin contribution in B\n-> K pi and pi pi from recent experimental data. The experimental data may be\nsuggesting that there are some discrepancies between the data and theoretical\nestimation in the branching ratios of them. In B -> K pi decays, to explain it,\na large electroweak penguin contribution and large strong phase differences\nseem to be needed. The contributions should appear also in B -> pi pi. We show,\nas an example, a solution to solve the discrepancies in both B -> K pi and B ->\npi pi. However the magnitude of the parameters and the strong phase estimated\nfrom experimental data are quite large compared with the theoretical\nestimations. It may be suggesting some new physics effects are including in\nthese processes. We will have to discuss about the dependence of the new\nphysics. To explain both modes at once, we may need large electroweak penguin\ncontribution with new weak phases and some SU(3) breaking effects by new\nphysics in both QCD and electroweak penguin type processes.\n", "  The process of $e^+ e^-$ annihilation into $\\pi^+ \\pi^-$ pair with radiation\nof the photon is considered. The amplitude of the reaction $e^+ e^- \\to \\pi^+\n\\pi^- \\gamma$ consists of the model independent initial-state radiation (ISR)\nand model dependent final-state radiation (FSR). The general structure of the\nFSR tensor is constructed from Lorentz covariance, gauge invariance and\ndiscrete symmetries in terms of the three invariant functions. To calculate\nthese functions we apply Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) with vector and\naxial-vector mesons.\n  The contribution of $e^+ e^- \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^- \\gamma$ process to the muon\nanomalous magnetic moment is evaluated, and results are compared with the\ndominant contribution in framework of a hybrid model, consisting of VMD and\npoint-like scalar electrodynamics.\n  The developed approach allows us also to calculate the $\\pi^+ \\pi^-$ charge\nasymmetry.\n", "  We investigate the full U(3)$\\otimes$U(3) chiral symmetry restoration, at\nfinite temperature and density, on the basis of a quark model which\nincorporates the most relevant properties of QCD in this context: explicit and\nspontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and axial U$_A$(1) symmetry breaking. A\nspecific lattice-inspired behavior of the topological susceptibility, combined\nwith the convergence of chiral partners, signals the onset of an effective\nchiral symmetry restoration. The results suggest that the axial part of the\nsymmetry is restored before the possible restoration of the full\nU(3)$\\otimes$U(3) chiral symmetry can occur. This conclusion is valid in the\ncontext of both finite temperature and density.\n", "  We propose a sophisticated framework for high-energy hadronic collisions,\nwherein different QCD physics processes are interleaved in a common sequence of\nfalling transverse-momentum values. Thereby phase-space competition is\nintroduced between multiple parton-parton interactions and initial-state\nradiation. As a first step we develop new transverse-momentum-ordered showers\nfor initial- and final-state radiation, which should be of use also beyond the\nscope of the current article. These showers are then applied in the context of\nmultiple interactions, and a few tests of the new model are presented. The\narticle concludes with an outlook on further aspects, such as the possibility\nof a shower branching giving partons participating in two different\ninteractions.\n", "  A method to extract Standard Model(SM) CP phases involving B decays is\npresented. The method involves a pair of decays where one decay receives a\nsignificant $b \\to d$ penguin contribution while the second has a significant\n$b \\to s$ penguin contribution, but is dominated by a single amplitude. SM CP\nphase information is obtained using the fact that the $b \\to s$ transition\namplitude is related by SU(3) to a piece of the amplitude with the $b \\to d$\ntransition. If there is significant new physics only in $b \\to s$ transitions\nand not in $b \\to d$ transitions then this method can be used to measure new\nphysics(NP) phases.\n", "  High-temperature resummed perturbation theory is plagued by poor convergence\nproperties. The problem appears for theories with bosonic field content such as\nQCD, QED or scalar theories. We calculate the pressure as well as other\nthermodynamic quantities at high temperature for a scalar one-component field\ntheory, solving a three-loop 2PI effective action numerically without further\napproximations. We present a detailed comparison with the two-loop\napproximation. One observes a strongly improved convergence behavior as\ncompared to perturbative approaches. The renormalization employed in this work\nextends previous prescriptions, and is sufficient to determine all counterterms\nrequired for the theory in the symmetric as well as the spontaneously broken\nphase.\n", "  We study the production of hadron pairs in proton-proton collisions,\nselecting pairs with large total transverse momentum with respect to the beam,\nand small relative transverse momentum, i.e., belonging to a single jet with\nlarge transverse momentum. We describe the process in terms of dihadron\nfragmentation functions. We consider the production of one pair in polarized\ncollisions (with one transversely polarized proton) and the production of two\npairs in unpolarized collisions. In the first case, we discuss how to observe\nthe quark transversity distribution in connection with a specific class of\ndihadron fragmentation functions, named interference fragmentation functions.\nIn the second case, we suggest how to determine the latter and also how to\nobserve linearly polarized gluons.\n", "  A generalization of the Heisenberg algebra has been recently constructed.\n  This generalized algebra has a characteristic function which depends on one\nof its generators. When this function is linear, $qJ_0+s$, it is possible to\nconstruct a Generalized Quantum Field Theory (GQFT) that creates at a\nspace-time a composite particle.In the present work we show that a generalized\nQFT can also be constructed consistently, even with a nonlinear characteristic\nfunction and leads to better results as long as we have more parameters to\n(possibly) fit the spectrum of a real composite particle.\n", "  We analyze the phase effect of the neutrino Yukawa matrix in the context of\nthe Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with right-handed neutrinos. Its\neffect can change the Lepton Flavor Violation branching ratios by a few order\nof magnitude.\n", "  We study global topological defects in the Jacobson-Corley model which breaks\nLorentz symmetry and involves up to fourth order derivatives. There is a window\nin the parameter space in which no solution exists. Otherwise, different\nprofiles are allowed for the same values of the parameters. For a scale of\n  Lorentz violation much higher than the scale of gauge symmetry breaking, the\nenergy densities are higher, of the same order or smaller than in the usual\ncase for domain walls, cosmic strings and hedgehogs respectively. Possible\ncosmological implications are suggested.\n", "  The problem of the backreaction during the process of electron-positron pair\nproduction by a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave propagating in a\nplasma is investigated. A model based on the relativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov\nequation with a source term corresponding to the Schwinger formula for the pair\ncreation rate is used. The damping of the wave, the nonlinear up-shift of its\nfrequency due to the plasma density increase and the effect of the damping on\nthe wave polarization and on the background plasma acceleration are\ninvestigated as a function of the wave amplitude.\n", "  We consider the mechanism of thermal leptogenesis at the TeV scale in the\ncontext of an extension of the Standard Model with 4 generations and the\ninclusion of four right-handed Majorana neutrinos. We obtain a value for the\nbaryon asymmetry of the\n  Universe in accordance with observations by solving the full set of coupled\nBoltzmann equations for this model.\n", "  The Two-Scale Model and its improved version were used to perform the fit to\nthe HERMES data for $\\nu$ (the virtual photon energy) and z (the fraction of\n  $\\nu$ carried by hadron) dependencies of nuclear multiplicity ratios for\n$\\pi^+$ and $\\pi^-$ mesons electro-produced on two nuclear targets ($^{14}$N\nand $^{84}$Kr). The quantitative criterium $\\chi ^2$ was used for the first\ntime to analyse the results of the model fit to the nuclear multiplicity ratios\ndata. The two-parameter's fit gives satisfactory agreement with the HERMES\ndata. Best values of the parameters were then used to calculate the $\\nu$- and\n$z$ - dependencies of nuclear attenuation for $\\pi^0$, K$^+$, K$^-$ and\n$\\bar{p}$ produced on $^{84}$Kr target, and also make a predictions for $\\nu$,\nz and the Q$^2$ (the photon virtuality) - dependencies of nuclear attenuation\ndata for those identified hadrons and nuclea, that will be published by HERMES.\n", "  Due to selection rules, new particles are sometimes discovered/predicted to\nbe produced in pairs. In the current search for SUSY particles this will occur\nif R-parity is conserved. In local relativistic field theory, there can be\nidentical particles which are neither bosons nor fermions which are associated\nwith higher-dimensional representations of the permutation group. Such\nparticles will generally be pair-produced and so empirical tests are required\nto exclude them. A parameter-free statistical model is used to study the\nunusual multiplicity signatures in coherent paraboson production versus the\ncase of ordinary bosons.\n", "  We examine SU(3) constraints on the spectrum and decay widths of cryptoexotic\nnucleon-like states in antidecuplet of pentaquarks. We show that in the ideal\nmixing scenario the number of free matrix elements describing splittings\nreduces from 4 to 2. Model-independent sum rules are derived.\n  Using as input $\\Theta^+$ and $\\Xi_{3/2}$ masses we show that it is difficult\nto interpret Roper and $N^{\\ast}(1710)$ nucleon resonances as cryptoexotic\npentaquarks. Large $N_c$ limit for antidecuplet and accompanying octet in the\ndiqaurk picture and the analogy with the soliton model is also discussed.\n", "  The next generation of $e^+e^-$ colliders will offer a possibility of clean\ntesting of QCD dynamics. Recent progress in the theoretical description of\nexclusive processes permits for many of them a consistent use of the\nperturbative QCD methods.\n  We find that already on the basis of Born approximation, the exclusive\ndiffractive production of two $\\rho$ mesons from virtual photons at very high\nenergies should be measurable at the linear collider (LC).\n", "  We study the regularities in the multiparticle production data obtained from\ndifferent types of collisions indicating the universality of the\nhadroproduction process.\n  The similarities of such bulk variables like the charged particle mean\nmultiplicity and the pseudorapidity density at midrapidity measured in\nnucleus-nucleus, (anti)proton-proton and e+e- interactions are analysed\naccording to the dissipating energy of participants and their types.\n  This approach shows a good agreement with the measurements in a wide range of\nnuclear collision energies from AGS to RHIC. The predictions up to the LHC\nenergies are made and compared to experimental extrapolations.\n", "  Generalized log-sine functions appear in higher order epsilon-expansion of\ndifferent Feynman diagrams. We present an algorithm for numerical evaluation of\nthese functions of real argument. This algorithm is implemented as C++ library\nwith arbitrary-precision arithmetics for integer 0 < k < 9 and j > 1. Some new\nrelations and representations for the generalized log-sine functions are given.\n", "  We review recent work to determine the strange quark mass m_s as well as the\nproposal to determine |V_{us}| using hadronic tau decay data. The recent update\nof the strange spectral function by OPAL and their moments of the invariant\nmass distribution are employed. Our results are |V_us|=0.2208 +- 0.0034 and m_s\n(2 GeV)=81 +- 22 MeV. Our result is already competitive to the standard\nextraction of |V_us| from K_e3 decays and to the new proposals to determine it.\nThe error on V_us is dominated by experiment and will be eventually much\nimproved by the B-factories hadronic tau data.\n  Ultimately, a simultaneous fit of both m_s and |V_us| to a set of moments of\nthe hadronic tau decays invariant mass distribution will provide one of the\nmost accurate determinations of these Standard Model parameters.\n", "  Downward going atmospheric tau neutrino flux is estimated in the presence of\nthree neutrino flavor oscillations for 1 GeV < E < 10^3 GeV.\n  The relative differences between the three and purely two neutrino flavor\noscillations are elaborated. As an implication, the downward going atmospheric\ntau neutrino flux is compared with the galactic plane tau neutrino flux that is\nalso estimated in the presence of three neutrino flavor oscillations. It is\npointed out that the galactic plane tau neutrino flux dominates over the\ndownward going atmospheric tau neutrino flux until E \\sim 10 GeV.\n", "  The linear k_\\perp-factorization is part and parcel of the pQCD description\nof high energy hard processes off free nucleons.\n  In the case of heavy nuclear targets the very concept of nuclear parton\ndensity becomes ill-defined as exemplified by the recent derivation [2] of\nnonlinear nuclear k_\\perp-factorization for forward dijet production in DIS off\nnuclei. Here we report a derivation of the related breaking of\nk_\\perp-factorization for single-jet processes. We present a general formalism\nand apply it to several cases of practical interest: open charm and quark and\ngluon jet production in the central to beam fragmentation region of\n\\gamma^*p,\\gamma^*A, pp and pA collisions. We show how the pattern of\nk_\\perp-factorization breaking and the nature and number of exchanged nuclear\npomerons do change within the phase space of produced quark and gluon jets. As\nan application of the nonlinear k_\\perp-factorization we discuss the Cronin\neffect. Our results are also applicable to the p_\\perp-dependence of the\nLandau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect for, and nuclear quenching of, jets produced\nin the proton hemisphere of pA collisions.\n", "  The correlator of vector heavy-quark currents at small q^2 is considered in\nthe large-beta_0 limit. The leading IR renormalon ambiguity of the sum of the\nperturbative series is canceled by the UV renormalon ambiguity of the gluon\ncondensate. Asymptotic behaviour of the perturbative series is obtained in a\nmodel-independent way, up to a single unknown normalization factor.\nGluon-virtuality distribution functions for the perturbative correction are\ncalculated.\n", "  We derive the effective Lagrangian of the physical four-dimensional fields in\nthe Randall-Sundrum (RS) model, and use this to calculate the Newtonian\ngravitational potential between two point sources on the brane. The effect of\nthe radion is emphasized, and it is shown to disappear when the hidden brane is\ntaken to infinity, i.e. when we only have one brane. As a preliminary, we\nderive the corresponding Lagrangian in the simpler geometry of a flat spacetime\nwith one extra dimension compactified on a torus. We also study the gauge\ninvariance of the theory, and note that the massless vector field that is\npresent for the torus disappears in the RS model because of the orbifold\nsymmetry.\n", "  The study of radiative phi decays into scalar mesons, with subsequent decay\ninto pi pi gamma, constitutes an important topic at the electron-positron\ncollider DAPHNE. The interference of the respective amplitude with the one for\npi+ pi- gamma production, where the photon originates from initial state\nradiation, will allow for unambiguous tests of models for the phi -> gamma\nf0(-> pi pi) amplitude.\n  The forward-backward asymmetry of charged pions, which is a clear signal of\nsuch an interference, amounts up to 30 % and is at the same time quite\nsensitive to the details of the various amplitudes.\n  The results for several characteristic cases are presented and their\nimplementation into the Monte Carlo generator PHOKHARA is described.\n", "  In the event that the Higgs mass is large or that the electroweak\ninteractions are strongly interacting at high energy, top quark couplings to\nlongitudinal components of the weak gauge bosons could offer important clues to\nthe underlying dynamics. It has been suggested that precision measurements of\nW_L W_L to t tbar and Z_L Z_L to t tbar might provide hints of new physics. In\nthis paper we present results of O(alpha_s) QCD corrections to V_LV_L to t tbar\nscattering at the ILC. We find that corrections to cross sections can be as\nlarge as 30% and must be accounted for in any precision measurement of VV to t\ntbar.\n", "  The color screening in a QCD plasma, that was studied in a formulation making\nevident similarities and differences with the electric case, is continued by\ntaking into account the contributions of real gluons. The results, which\ninclude a numerical analysis not previously performed, show a damping of the\ncorrelation function which, if not exponential, does not differ very much from\nthat form.\n  The role of the temperature, which affect both the population and the\ndynamics of the quark-gluon system, is found to be relevant.\n", "  In this paper we provide an exact formula for the area law of the 't Hooft\nloop for any SU(N) gauge group to cubic order in hot gauge theory.\n  The correction is very small for all temperatures above $T_c$, in stark\ncontrast to the cubic correction to the pressure. The gradient approximation in\na previous paper, only valid for large N, is in excellent agreement with the\npresent, exact evalution. Comparison to lattice data is good. Casimir scaling\nis violated by a small amount not yet resolved by the precision of lattice\ndata.\n", "  Sneutrino resonances at a high energy linear e+e- collider may be one of the\nclearest signals of supersymmetry without R-parity, especially when the\nR-parity-violating coupling is too small to produce observable excesses in\nfour-fermion processes. However, there is no guarantee that the sneutrino pole\nwill lie anywhere near the machine energy. We show that associated photon\nproduction induces the necessary energy spread, and that the resonance then\nleaves a clear imprint in the photon spectrum. It follows that tagging of a\nhard mono-energetic photon for a variety of possible final states provides a\nrealistic method of separating sneutrino resonance signals from the Standard\nModel backgrounds.\n", "  The ultraviolet asymptotic behavior of the gluon propagator is evaluated in\nthe maximal Abelian gauge in the SU(2) gauge theory on the basis of the\nrenormalization-group improved perturbation theory at the one-loop level.\nSquare-root singularities obtained in the Euclidean domain are attributed to\nartifacts of the one-loop approximation in the maximal Abelian gauge and the\nstandard normalization condition for the propagator used in our study. It is\nargued that this gauge is essentially nonperturbative.\n", "  The next generation of $e^+e^-$-colliders will offer a possibility of clean\ntesting of QCD dynamics in the Regge limit. Recent progress in the theoretical\ndescription of exclusive processes permits for many of them a consistent use of\nthe perturbative QCD methods.\n  We advocate that the exclusive diffractive production of two $\\rho$ mesons\nfrom virtual photons at very high energies should be measurable at the future\nlinear collider (LC).\n", "  We discuss experimental features of identified particle production from\nnucleus-nucleus collisions. These features reflect hadronization from a\ndeconfined partonic matter whose particle formation scheme is distinctly\ndifferent from fragmentation phenomenology in elementary collisions.\nMulti-parton dynamics, such as quark coalescences or recombinations, appear to\nbe essential to explain the experimental measurements at the intermediate\ntransverse momentum of 2--5 GeV/c. Constituent quarks seem to be the dominant\ndegrees of freedom at hadronization.\n  Heavy quark production should help quantify deconfined matter properties.\n", "  We apply, to the new OPAL data on V+A strange spectral functions, a suitable\ncombination of QCD spectral sum rules directly sensitive to the combination of\nstrange quark (m_s) and tachyonic gluon (\\lambda^2) masses . Using the mean\nvalue of \\lambda^2 from a sum rule analysis of different channels, we deduce\nthe invariant strange quark mass m_s= (106 +33 -37) MeV to order \\alpha_s^3,\nwhich leads to the running mass m_s(2 GeV)= (93 +29 -32) MeV. We also obtain an\ninteresting though less competitive estimate of the CKM angle:\n|V_{us}|=0.217\\pm 0.019.\n", "  We study phenomenological predictions in the scenario with the\nquasi-degenerate relation among neutrino Dirac masses, m_D1 simeq m_D2 < m_D3,\nassuming the bi-maximal mixing at the grand unification scale in supersymmetric\nstandard models with right-handed neutrinos. A sufficient lepton number\nasymmetry can be produced for successful leptogenesis. The lepton flavor\nviolating process mu to e gamma can be enhanced due to the Majorana phase, so\nthat it can be detectable at forthcoming experiments. The processes tau to e\ngamma and tau to mu gamma are suppressed because of the structure of neutrino\nDirac masses, and their branching ratios are smaller than that of mu to e\ngamma.\n", "  Charmless B->PP decays are studied using flavor SU(3) symmetry. Amplitude\nwith charming penguin topology is considered for two cases: with zero and with\narbitrary strong phase. Two sets of data (an older and the most recent one) are\nused in the fits, so that the stability of the fits is tested. It is shown that\nwithin the present uncertainties in the data the parameters of the fit may be\nsignificantly modified, especially the gamma angle. The fits indicate the\nstrong phase of the charming penguin amplitude to be around $\\pm 20^{o}$.\n", "  It is pointed out that the set theory gave the exact symmetry while the group\ntheory did not. The triplicity of quarks and leptons is also pointed out. The\nreason of seven families of particles and in each family eight number of\nparticles is elaborated.\n", "  We consider leptogenesis in a minimal\n  S_3 extension of the standard model with an additional Z_2 symmetry in the\nleptonic sector. It is found that the CP phase appearing in the neutrino mixing\nis the same as that for the CP asymmetries responsible for leptogenesis.\nBecause of the discrete S_3 x Z_2 flavor symmetries, the CP asymmetries are\nstrongly suppressed. We therefore assume that the resonant enhancement of the\nCP asymmetries takes place to obtain a realistic size of baryon number\nasymmetry in theuniverse. Three degenerate right-handed neutrino masses of\nO(10) TeV are theoretically expected in this model.\n", "  We derive in detail a condition on the Higgs mass parameters that is\nnecessary for the recently proposed ``split supersymmetry''\n  (split SUSY) scenario to provide a realistic magnitude of $\\tan \\beta$. The\nnature of this condition can be understood by showing how the Higgs sector of\nthe minimal supersymmetric Standard Model reduces to that of the Standard Model\nin the heavy limit of the soft supersymmetry breaking\n  Higgs mass parameters. Based on this condition, we present some simple\nsupersymmetry breaking models that each provides a realistic split-SUSY mass\nspectrum, in accordance with the scale of the gravitino mass ($m_{3/2}$) in\nrelation to those of the soft scalar mass ($\\tilde{m}$) and the gaugino mass\n($M_{1/2}$) employed in each, namely $m_{3/2} \\geq \\tilde{m}$, $\\tilde{m} \\geq\nm_{3/2} \\geq M_{1/2}$ and $M_{1/2} \\geq m_{3/2}$, respectively, with the\nrelation $\\tilde{m} \\gg M_{1/2}$ of the split-SUSY mass spectrum.\n", "  We propose an effective theory which governs Pomeron dynamics in QCD at high\nenergy, in the leading logarithmic approximation, and in the limit where N_c,\nthe number of colors, is large. In spite of its remarkably simple structure,\nthis effective theory generates precisely the evolution equations for\nscattering amplitudes that have been recently deduced from a more complete\nmicroscopic analysis. It accounts for the BFKL evolution of the Pomerons\ntogether with their interactions: dissociation (one Pomeron splitting into two)\nand recombination (two Pomerons merging into one). It is constructed by\nexploiting a duality principle relating the evolutions in the target and the\nprojectile, more precisely, splitting and merging processes, or fluctuations in\nthe dilute regime and saturation effects in the dense regime. The simplest\nPomeron loop calculated with the effective theory is free of both ultraviolet\nor infrared singularities.\n", "  A complete analysis is given of the implications of the empirical indications\nfor a positive strangeness magnetic moment $\\mu_s$ of the proton on the\npossible configurations of the $uuds\\bar s$ component of the proton. A positive\nvalue for $\\mu_s$ is obtained in the $s\\bar s$ configuration where the $uuds$\nsubsystem is in an orbitally excited state with $[4]_{[FS]}[22]_F[22]_S$\nflavor-spin symmetry, which is likely to have the lowest energy. The\nconfigurations in which the $\\bar s$ is orbitally excited, which include the\nconventional $K^+\\Lambda^0$ configuration, with exception of that in which the\n$uuds$ component has spin 2, yield negative values for $\\mu_s$. The hidden\nstrangeness analogues of recently proposed quark cluster models for the\n$\\theta^+$ pentaquark give differing signs for $\\mu_s$.\n", "  We predict the charged lepton electric dipole moments in the split fermion\nscenario in the framework of the two Higgs doublet model. We observe that the\nnumerical value of the muon (tau) electric dipole moment is at the order of the\nmagnitude of $10^{-22} (e-cm)$ ($10^{-20} (e-cm)$) and there is an enhancement\nin the case of two extra dimensions, especially for the tau lepton electric\ndipole moment.\n", "  Comments on the chiral symmetry restoration through the Hawking-Unruh effect\nare given.\n", "  We study in this paper the possible influence of the dark energy on the\ndetection of the dark matter particles. In models of dark energy described by a\ndynamical scalar field such as the Quintessence, its interaction with the dark\nmatter will cause the dark matter particles such as the neutralino vary as a\nfunction of space and time. Given a specific model of the Quintessence and its\ninteraction in this paper we calculate numerically the corrections to the\nneutralino masses and the induced spectrum of the neutrinos from the\nannihilation of the neutralinos pairs in the core of the Sun. This study gives\nrise to a possibility of probing for dark energy in the experiments of\ndetecting the dark matter particles.\n", "  We examine how the production of TeV scale black holes at colliders is\ninfluenced by the presence of Lovelock higher-curvature terms in the action of\nmodels with large extra dimensions. Such terms are expected to arise on rather\ngeneral grounds, e.g., from string theory and are often used in the literature\nto model modifications to the Einstein-Hilbert action arising from quantum\nand/or stringy corrections. While adding the invariant which is quadratic in\nthe curvature leads to quantitative modifications in black hole properties,\ncubic and higher invariants are found to produce significant qualitative\nchanges, e.g., classically stable black holes. We use these higher-order\ncurvature terms to construct a toy model of the black hole production cross\nsection threshold. For reasonable parameter values we demonstrate that detailed\nmeasurements of the properties of black holes at future colliders will be\nhighly sensitive to the presence of the Lovelock higher-order curvature terms.\n", "  In the large extra dimension model of Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali the\npresence of an interaction between the Ricci scalar curvature and the Higgs\ndoublet of the Standard Model makes a light Higgs boson observable at LHC at\nthe 5 sigma level through the fusion process pp-> W*W* +X -> Higgs,\ngraviscalars +X -> invisible+X for the portion of the Higgs-graviscalar mixing\n(xi) and effective Planck mass (M_D) parameter space where channels relying on\nvisible Higgs decays fail to achieve a 5 sigma signal. However even if the LHC\nhas a good chance of seeing a signal, it will not be able to determine the\nparameters of the model with any real precision.\n  This goal can be reached by adding the following LC measurements:\ngamma+missing E_T, Higgs production and decay in the visible SM-like final\nstates and in the invisible final state.\n", "  We have proposed a very attractive scenario of Grand Unified\n  Theories (GUTs). It employs the supersymmetry (SUSY) and an anomalous U(1)\nsymmetry whose anomaly is canceled via the Green-Schwarz mechanism. In this\nscenario, the doublet-triplet splitting problem is solved and the success of\nthe gauge coupling unification in the minimal SU(5) GUT is naturally explained\nwith sufficiently stable nucleon. Realistic fermion Yukawa matrices can also be\nrealized simultaneously. In addition, a horizontal symmetry helps to solve the\n  SUSY-flavor problem.\n", "  The QCD (tri)critical point, a genuine second-order phase transition, implies\nexistence of a massless scalar mode, and singular behavior near it. In this\nwork we however focus on the finite region around it, defined by a condition\n$m_\\sigma=2m_\\pi$. We point out that in this region the inter-hadron\ninteraction should be dramatically changed. Light sigma should increase\nattractive mean field potentials for baryons and non-Goldstone mesons. The same\neffect can be observed in additional downward shift of the mass of vector\nmesons $\\rho,\\omega,\\phi$, accessible via dilepton experiments. For pions we\npredict that the mean change due to light sigma is in fact a\n  $repulsive$ mean potential. The implications of these effects for collective\npion and nucleon flows, radial directed and elliptic, are estimated. Finally,\nwe speculate tha unusual behavior of flows observed by NA49 at 40 GeV PbPb\ncollisions at SPS may be explained by location of the critical point region\nnearby.\n", "  Radiative corrections to neutrino mixings in seesaw models depend on the\nnature of new physics between the weak and the GUT-seesaw scales and can be\ntaken into account using the renormalization group equations. This new physics\neffect becomes particularly important for models with quasi-degenerate neutrino\nmasses where small neutrino mixings at the seesaw scale can get magnified by\nradiative renormalization effects alone to match observations. This mechanism\nof radiative magnification which provides a simple understanding of why lepton\nmixings are so different from quark mixings was demonstrated by us for the\nstandard supersymmetry scenario where the particle spectrum becomes\nsupersymmetric above the weak scale. In this paper, we examine this phenomenon\nin split supersymmetry scenarios and find that the mechanism works also for\nthis scenario provided the SUSY scale is at least 2-3 orders below the\nGUT-seesaw scale and one has larger values of ${\\tan\\beta}$.\n", "  QCD instantons are known to produce deeply bound diquarks. We study whether\nit may be used as building blocks in the formation of multiquark states, in\nparticular pentaquarks and dibaryons.\n  A simple model is presented in which the lowest scalar diquark (and possibly\nthe tensor one) can be treated as an independent ``body'', with the same color\nand (approximately) the same mass as a constituent (anti)quark. In it a new\nsymmetry exists between states with the same number of ``bodies'' but different\nnumber of quarks appear, in particular the 3-``body'' pentaquarks can be\nnaturally related to some excited baryons. The limitations of this model are\nseen from the fact that it leads to light dibaryon $H$. Another reported work\nis based on a calculation of a large set of correlation functions for nonlocal\noperators with 4 to 6 light quarks in the Random Instanton Liquid Model (RILM).\n  The effective interaction between diquarks is studied and found to posses a\nstrongly {\\em repulsive core}, due to the Pauli principle for quark zero modes.\n", "  Within an explicit scalar QED model we compare, at fixed x << 1, the\nleading-twist K_T-dependent `quark' distribution f_q(x, K_T) probed in deep\ninelastic scattering and Drell-Yan production, and show that the model is\nconsistent with the universality of f_q(x, K_T). The extension of the model\nfrom the aligned-jet to the 'symmetric' kinematical regime reveals interesting\nproperties of the physics of Coulomb rescatterings when comparing DIS and DY\nprocesses. At small x the transverse momentum <k_T^2> induced by multiple\nscattering on a single centre is process dependent, as well as the transverse\nmomentum broadening occurring in collisions on a finite size nuclear target.\n", "  It is shown that particle motion in a bent (straight) crystal is accompanied\nby particle spin rotation and oscillations that allows to measure the tensor\nelectric and magnetic polarizabilities of nuclei and elementary particles. It\nis shown that channelling of particles in either straight or bent crystal with\nthe polarized nuclei could be used both to analyze polarization of high energy\nparticles and polarize them.\n", "  At present paper we performed a detailed numerical analysis of four charged\nleptons photoproduction in frame of standard theory of electroweak interaction.\nTotal and differential cross sections are obtained by using of the Monte-Carlo\nmethod of numerical integration. Different energies of initial photons (60-2000\nGeV in c.m.s.), definite and averaged spin states of interacting particles and\nfixed kinematical cuts are considered.\n", "  The effects of strong color electric fields (SCF) on the baryon production at\nRHIC are studied in the framework of HIJING/B\\=B (v2.0) model. The particle\nspecies dependence of nuclear modification factors (NMF) are analyzed for Au+Au\ncollisions at 200A GeV. A doubling of the string tension leading to a\nmodification of the strangeness suppression according to Schwinger mechanism is\nshown to provide an alternate explanation to coalescence models for the\ninterpretation of the observed baryon and meson production at moderate $p_T$\nand results in a predicted enhancement in the (multi)strange (anti)hyperon\nproduction.\n", "  We develop a simple model to study the heavy quarkonium-hadron cross section\nin the high energy limit. The hadron is represented by an external electric\ncolor field (capacitor) and the heavy quarkonium is represented by a small\ncolor dipole. Using high energy approximations we compute the relevant cross\nsections, which are then compared with results obtained with other methods. Our\ncalculations are presented in a pedagogical way accessible to undergraduate\nstudents.\n", "  We construct the effective potential for a QCD-like theory using the\nauxiliary field method. The chiral phase transition exhibited by the model at\nfinite temperature and the quark chemical potential is studied from the\nviewpoint of the shape change of the potential near the critical point. We\nfurther generalize the effective potential so as to have quark number and\nscalar quark densities as independent variables near the tri-critical point.\n", "  In this article, we study the structures of the pseudoscalar mesons $\\pi$,\n$K$ and the scalar diquarks $U^a$, $D^a$, $S^a$ in the framework of the coupled\nrainbow Schwinger-Dyson equation and ladder\n  Bethe-Salpeter equation with the confining effective potential.\n  The $u$, $d$, $s$ quarks have small current masses, and the renormalization\nis very large, the mass poles in the timelike region are absent which\nimplements confinement naturally. The Bethe-Salpeter wavefunctions of the\npseudoscalar mesons $\\pi$, $K$ and the scalar diquarks $U^a$, $D^a$, $S^a$ have\nthe same type (Gaussian type) momentum dependence, center around zero momentum\nand extend to the energy scale about $q^2=1GeV^2$ which happen to be the energy\nscale for the chiral symmetry breaking, the strong interactions in the infrared\nregion result in bound (or quasi-bound) states. The numerical results for the\nmasses and decay constants of the $\\pi$, $K$ mesons can reproduce the\nexperimental values, the ground state masses of the scalar diquarks $U^a$,\n$D^a$, $S^a$ are consistent with the existing theoretical calculations. We\nsuggest a new Lagrangian which may explain the uncertainty of the masses of the\nscalar diquarks .\n", "  We present in this paper the analysis of the measurement of the unknown PMNS\nparameters $\\theta_{13}$ and $\\delta$ at future LBL facilities performing\ncomplete three parameters fits, each time fully including in the fit one of the\natmospheric and solar oscillation parameters within its present (future) error.\nWe show that, due to the presence of degeneracies, present uncertainties on\n$\\theta_{23}$ and $\\Delta m^2_{23}$ worsen significantly the precision on\n($\\theta_{13}$,$\\delta$) at future LBL experiments. Only if a precision on the\natmospheric parameters at least similar to what expected at T2K-I is reached,\nthen the sensitivities to $\\theta_{13}$ and $\\delta$ that have been presented\nin the literature for many facilities (where $\\theta_{23}$ and $\\Delta\nm^2_{23}$ are generally considered as fixed external inputs) can indeed be\nalmost recovered.On the other hand, the impact on this measurement of the\nuncertainties on the solar parameters, $\\theta_{12}$ and $\\Delta m^2_{12}$ is\nalready negligible. Our analysis has been performed using three reference\nsetups: the SPL Super-Beam and the standard low-$\\gamma$ $\\beta$-Beam, both\naiming toward a Mton Water \\v{C}erenkov detector located at L=130 km; the 50\nGeV Neutrino Factory with a 40 kton Magnetized Iron Detector to look for the\n``golden channel'' $\\nu_e \\to \\nu_\\mu$ with baseline L=3000 km and a 4 kton\nEmulsion Cloud Chamber to look for the ``silver channel'' $\\nu_e \\to \\nu_\\tau$\nwith baseline L=732 km.\n", "  This is an attempt to summarize the theoretical talks given at the First\nInternational Conference \"Hard Probes '04\", dedicated to the study of the\nproperties of quark-gluon matter and its diagnostics with the hard processes.\n  The talk covers the following topics: the structure of quark-gluon matter at\nfinite temperature; the theory of nuclear wave functions at small Bjorken x;\nthe propagation of jets, heavy quarkonia and heavy quarks through the dense QCD\nmatter.\n", "  We combine Tsallis distributed massless partons to an effective thermal\nprehadron spectrum by folding. A limiting temperature and a mass spectrum\ncombined of three exponentials emerge from this procedure. Meson and baryon\nresonance spectra have different polynomial prefactors.\n", "  We perform a general 1-loop analysis by adding extra matter to the SM\ncontent, as well as by allowing a non-standard U(1)Y normalization in order to\nachieve unification. We find numerous solutions with U(1)Y only charged extra\nmatter and unification scale of the order of MU=10^{16} GeV, or with SU(2)\ncharged extra matter with lower MU. We next identify the SM extra matter as\noriginating from the breaking of SO(10) either through the Pati-Salam group\nSU(4)xSU(2)LxSU(2)R or the flipped SU(5). In both cases, unification can be\nachieved with a rather minimal extra content. Contrary to the one-step SU(5)\nunification, in the two-step SO(10) unification we are discussing, coulored\nextra matter is not necessary. Finally, we discuss a split-supersymmetry like\ncase, where extra matter is added to the split supersymmetric spectrum in order\nto attain 1-loop unification.\n", "  The matrix element for the decay of orthopositronium to three photons can be\nexpressed in terms of three independent amplitudes. We describe the analytic\nevaluation of these amplitudes, both to lowest order and with the inclusion of\nall one-loop corrections. We use these amplitudes to find precise values for\nthe one-loop correction to the orthopositronium decay rate\nGamma_1=-10.286606(10) (alpha/pi) Gamma_{LO}, and for the order-alpha^2\n\"square\" correction to the decay rate Gamma_2(square) = 28.860(2) (alpha/pi)^2\nGamma_{LO}, where Gamma_{LO} is the lowest order rate. We give in explicit form\nthe function describing the one-loop correction to the distribution in phase\nspace of the final state photons.\n", "  In this work on the basis of Kadomtsev's kinetic fluctuation theory we\npresent the more general expression for noise-noise correlation function in\neffective theory for ultrasoft field modes.\n", "  We study the nuclear mu-e conversion in the general framework of the\neffective Lagrangian approach without referring to any specific realization of\nthe physics beyond the standard model (SM) responsible for lepton flavor\nviolation (LFV). We analyze the role of scalar meson exchange between the\nlepton and nucleon currents and show its relevance for the coherent channel of\nmu-e conversion. We show that this mechanism introduces modifications in the\npredicted mu-e conversion rates in comparison with the conventional direct\nnucleon mechanism, based on the contact type interactions of the nucleon\ncurrents with the LFV leptonic current. We derive from the experimental data\nlower limits on the mass scales of the generic LFV lepton-quark contact terms\nand demonstrate that they are more stringent than the similar limits existing\nin the literature.\n", "  Exotic dark matter and dark energy together seem to dominate in the Universe.\nSupersymmetry naturally provides a candidate for the dark matter constituents\nvia the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). The most important process for\ndirectly detecting dark matter is the LSP-nucleus elastic scattering by\nmeasuring the energy of the recoiling nucleus. In the present work we explore a\nnovel process, which has definite experimental advantages, that is the\ndetection of the dark matter constituents by observing the low energy\nionization electrons. These electrons, which are produced during the\nLSP-nucleus collision, may be observed separately or in coincidence with the\nrecoiling nuclei.\n  We develop the formalism and apply it in calculating the ratio of the\nionization rate to the nuclear recoil rate in a variety of atoms including\nNe-20, Ar-40, Ge-76, Kr-78 and Xe-132 employing realistic Hartree-Fock electron\nwave functions.\n  The obtained ratios are essentially independent of all parameters of\nsupersymmetry except the neutralino mass, but they crucially depend on the\nelectron energy cut off. These ratios per electron tend to increase with the\natomic number and can be as high as 10 per cent. Based on our results it is\nboth interesting and realistic to detect the LSP by measuring the ionization\nelectrons following the-LSP nuclear collisions.\n", "  If dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs),\nannihilation of WIMPs in the galactic center may lead to an observable\nenhancement of high energy gamma ray fluxes. We predict the shape and\nnormalization of the component of the flux due to final state radiation by\ncharged particles produced in WIMP annihilation events. The prediction is made\nwithout any assumptions about the microscopic theory responsible for WIMPs, and\ndepends only mildly on the unknown distribution of the total WIMP annihilation\ncross section among the possible final states. In particular, if the WIMPs\nannihilate into a pair of charged fermions (leptons or quarks), the photon\nspectrum possesses a sharp edge feature, dropping abruptly at a photon energy\nequal to the WIMP mass. If such a feature is observed, it would provide strong\nevidence for the WIMP-related nature of the flux enhancement, as well as a\nmeasurement of the WIMP mass. We discuss the prospects for observational\ndiscovery of this feature at ground-based and space-based gamma ray telescopes.\n", "  The measurements of the parameters of the neutrino mixing matrix in the\npresent and future neutrino oscillation experiments at accelerators are\npresented. The perspectives for high intensity new neutrino facilities as\nSuperBeams, BetaBeams and Neutrino Factories devoted to precise measurements\nsubleading numu to nue oscillation parameters at the atmospheric scale are\ndiscussed. Emphasis is on the determination of the currently unknown 1-3 sector\nof the leptonic mixing matrix (i.e. the mixing between the first and third\ngeneration and the CP violating Dirac phase) and on possible experimental\nprograms to be developed in Europe.\n", "  The role of the auxiliary scalar field $\\phi$ of Brans-Dicke theory played in\nbaryon number asymmetry is discussed in this paper. We consider a derivative\ncoupling of this gravitational scalar field to the baryon current ${J^{\\mu}}_B$\nor the current of the baryon number minus lepton number ${J^{\\mu}}_{B-L}$ based\non a series of works of R. Morganstern about the Brans-Dicke cosmology. We find\nthat the spontaneous baryogenesis by this coupling is capable to yield a\nsufficient baryon asymmetry $n_B/s\\sim 10^{10} $ for the time of the grand\nunification is in a little advanced. In addition, Davoudiasl et al have\nrecently introduced a new type of interaction between the Ricci scalar $R$ and\nthe bayon current $J^{\\mu}$, $\\partial_{\\mu}R J^{\\mu}$ and also proposed a\nmechanism for baryogenesis, the gravitational baryogenesis. However, the\nEinstein equation tell us that $\\dot{R}=0$ in the radiation-dominated epoch of\nthe standard FRW cosmology. In this paper we reconsider the feasibility of\nhaving gravitational baryongenesis with such a form of interaction in\nradiation-filled Brans-Dicke cosmology. We will show that $\\dot{R}$ does not\nvanish in this case and the required baryon number asymmetry can also be\nachieved.\n", "  We investigate the correlations between the scalar meson configurations and\nOkuba-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) rule violations in the hadronic decays of heavy\nquarkonia, e.g. $J/\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon$, into isoscalar vector meson ($\\phi$\nand $\\omega$) and scalar mesons ($f_0(1710)$, $f_0(1500)$, and $f_0(1370)$). It\nshows that the dramatic change of the values of the branching ratio fraction of\n$\\phi f_0/\\omega f_0$ from low (e.g. in $J/\\psi$ decays) to high energies (e.g.\nin $\\Upsilon$ decays) will not only test the glueball-$Q\\bar{Q}$ mixings, but\nalso provide important information about the mysterious OZI-rule violations\nwithin the scalars.\n", "  We review the work discussed and developed under the topic ``Resummation'' at\nWorking Group 2 ``Multijet final states and energy flow'', of the HERA-LHC\nWorkshop. We emphasise the role played by HERA observables in the development\nof resummation tools via, for instance, the discovery and resummation of\nnon-global logarithms. We describe the event-shapes subsequently developed for\nhadron colliders and present resummed predictions for the same using the\nautomated resummation program CAESAR. We also point to ongoing studies at HERA\nwhich can be of benefit for future measurements at hadron colliders such as the\nLHC, specifically dijet $E_t$ and angular spectra and the transverse momentum\nof the Breit current hemisphere.\n", "  Searches for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics are\nperformed at accelerators worldwide. Although having poorer detection\ncapabilities and large beam uncertainties, ultra high energy cosmic ray (UHECR)\nexperiments present a unique opportunity to look for new physics far beyond the\nTeV. Nearly horizontal energetic neutrinos, seeing a large atmospheric target\nvolume and with negligible background from \"ordinary\" cosmic rays, are ideal to\nexplore rare processes.\n  The sensitivity of present and planned experiments to different new physics\nscenarios is estimated, including mini black-holes, excited leptons and\nleptoquarks.\n", "  The experimental determination of low energy pi K scattering phase shifts\nwould assist in determining scattering lengths as well as low energy constants\nof chiral perturbation theory for which sum rules have been constructed. The\nFOCUS collaboration has presented evidence for interference pheomena from their\nanalysis of D_l4 decays based on decay amplitudes suitable for a cascade decay\nD -> K* -> K pi. We point out that if the well-known full five body kinematics\nare taken into account, pi K scattering phases may be extracted. We also point\nout that other distributions considered in the context of K_l4 decays can be\napplied to charm meson decays to provide constraints on violation of |Delta\nI|=1/2 rule and T-violation.\n", "  We present a very general argument that the analogue of a heavy pentaquark (a\nstate with the quantum numbers of a baryon combined with an additional light\nquark and a heavy antiquark) must exist as a particle stable under strong\ninteractions in the combined heavy quark and large Nc limits of QCD. Moreover,\nin the combined limit these heavy pentaquark states fill multiplets of\nSU(4)xO(8)xSU(2). We explore the question of whether corrections in the\ncombined 1/Nc and 1/mQ expansions are sufficiently small to maintain this\nqualitative result. Since no model-independent way is known to answer this\nquestion, we use a class of ``realistic'' hadronic models in which a pentaquark\ncan be formed via nucleon-heavy meson binding through a pion-exchange\npotential. These models have the virtue that they necessarily yield the correct\nbehavior in the combined limit, and the long-distance parts of the interactions\nare model independent. If the long-distance attraction in these models were to\npredict bound states in a robust way (i.e., largely insensitive to the details\nof the short-range interaction), then one could safely conclude that heavy\npentaquarks do exist. However, in practice the binding does depend very\nstrongly on the details of the short-distance physics, suggesting that the real\nworld is not sufficiently near the combined large Nc, mQ limit to use it as a\nreliable guide. Whether stable heavy pentaquarks exist remains an open\nquestion.\n", "  We study the large order behaviour in perturbation theory of the Bjorken,\nEllis-Jaffe and Gross-Llewellyn-Smith sum rules. In particular, we consider\ntheir first infrared renormalons, for which we obtain their analytic structure\nwith logarithmic accuracy and also an approximate determination of their\nnormalization constant. Estimates of higher order terms of the perturbative\nseries are given. The Renormalon subtracted scheme is worked out for these\nobservables and compared with experimental data. Overall, good agreement with\nexperiment is found. This allows us to obtain {\\hat a}_0 and some higher-twist\nnon-perturbative constants from experiment: {\\hat a}_0=0.141\\pm 0.089;\nf_{3,RS}(1 GeV)=-0.124^{+0.137}_{-0.142} GeV^2.\n", "  We study solutions of the relativistic hydrodynamical equations, which\ndescribe spherical or cylindrical expansion of ideal fluid. We derived\napproximate solutions involving two arbitrary functions, which describe\nasymptotic behavior of expanding fireballs in ultra-relativistic limit. In case\nof a sufficiently stiff linear equation of state the solution may be\nrepresented in form of an asymptotic series.\n", "  The H1 and ZEUS published PDF analyses are compared, including a discussion\nof the different treatments of correlated systematic uncertainties. Differences\nin the data sets and the analyses are investigated by putting the H1 data set\nthrough both PDF analyses and by putting the ZEUS and H1 data sets through the\nsame (ZEUS) analysis, separately. Finally the HERA averaged data set is put\nthrough the ZEUS PDF analysis and the result is compared to that obtained when\nputting the ZEUS and H1 data sets through this analysis together, using both\nthe\n  Offset and the Hessian methods of treating correlated systematic\nuncertainties.\n", "  We consider the existence of the state X^0 (214 MeV) in Sigma^+ -> p mu^+\nmu^- decay found by the HyperCP collaboration. We assume that a fundamental\nspin zero boson X^0 coupled to quarks leads to flavor changing s -> d X^0\nprocess. We estimate the scalar and pseudoscalar coupling constants by\nconsidering Sigma^+ -> p X^0 and K^+ -> pi^+ X^0 processes, and find that\npseudoscalar coupling dominates. We then evaluate the branching ratios for K_L\n-> pi^0 pi^0 X^0, pi^+ pi^- X^0 and Omega^- -> Xi^- X^0 decays. All these rates\nare found to be in the measurable ranges. We also comment on X^0 coupling to\nmuons and constraints from muon g-2.\n", "  Branching ratio for B -> K_1 gamma at next-to-leading order of alpha_s has\nbeen calculated in Large Energy Effective Theory. By incorporating the higher\ntwist effects in light cone decay amplitude for axial K-meson, it is shown that\nthe form factor is not sensitive to these twists.\n", "  In the two Higgs doublet model with no additional symmetries in the scalar\nsector (different from the gauge and Lorentz symmetries), it is customary to\nreparameterize the model by rotating the scalar doublets such that one of the\nvacuum expectation values vanishes. It is well known that the Yukawa sector of\nthe model is unaffected by such transformation. Notwithstanding, since the\nHiggs potential must also be transformed, it is necessary to show that such\nsector is also unaltered in its physical content. We demostrate that the\nphysical content of the potential is invariant even when the charge conjugation\nsymmetry is demanded.\n", "  We study neutralino sectors in extensions of the MSSM that dynamically\ngenerate the mu-term. The extra neutralino states are superpartners of the\nHiggs singlets and/or additional gauge bosons. The extended models may have\ndistinct lightest neutralino properties which can have important influences on\ntheir phenomenology. We consider constraints on the lightest neutralino from\nLEP, Tevatron, and (g-2)_mu measurements and the relic density of the dark\nmatter. The lightest neutralino can be extremely light and/or dominated by its\nsinglino component, which does not couple directly to SM particles except Higgs\ndoublets.\n", "  The quark-gluon plasma, possibly created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions, is a strongly interacting many-body parton system. By comparison\nwith strongly coupled electromagnetic plasmas (classical and non-relativistic)\nit is concluded that the quark-gluon plasma could be in the liquid phase. As an\nexample for a strongly coupled plasma, complex plasmas, which show liquid and\neven solid phases, are discussed briefly. Furthermore, methods based on\ncorrelation functions for confirming and investigating the quark-gluon-plasma\nliquid are presented. Finally, consequences of the strong coupling, in\nparticular a cross section enhancement in accordance with experimental\nobservations at RHIC, are discussed.\n", "  In a R-parity violating (RPV) model of neutrino mass with three bilinear\ncouplings $\\mu_i$ and three trilinear couplings $\\lambda'_{i33}$, where $i$ is\nthe lepton index, we find six generic scenarios each with a distinctive pattern\nof the trilinear couplings consistent with the oscillation data. These patterns\nmay be reflected in direct RPV decays of the lighter top squark or in the RPV\ndecays of the lightest superparticle, assumed to be the lightest neutralino.\n  Typical signal sizes at the Tevatron RUN II and the LHC have been estimated\nand the results turn out to be encouraging.\n", "  We analyze double Higgs boson production at the Large Hadron Collider in the\ncontext of Little Higgs models. In double Higgs production, the diagrams\ninvolved are directly related to those that cause the cancellation of the\nquadratic divergence of the Higgs self-energy, providing a robust prediction\nfor this class of models. We find that in extensions of this model with the\ninclusion of a so-called T-parity, there is a significant enhancement in the\ncross sections as compared to the Standard Model.\n", "  The virtual two-loop corrections for Higgs production in gluon fusion are\ncalculated analytically in QCD for arbitrary Higgs and quark masses. Both\nscalar and pseudo-scalar Higgs bosons are considered. The results are obtained\nby expanding the known one-dimensional integral representation in terms of\nm_H/m_q, and matching it with a suitably chosen ansatz of Harmonic\nPolylogarithms. This ansatz is motivated by the known analytic result for the\nHiggs decay rate into two photons. The method also allows us to check this\nresult and to extend it to the pseudo-scalar decay rate.\n", "  We report on our computation of the mixed QCD and weak corrections to $q\n{\\bar q} \\to t\\bar{t}$ including $t, \\bar t$ spin effects, in particular on\nsingle top spin asymmetries.\n", "  We review the current status of the neutrino mass and mixing parameters\nneeded to reconstruct the neutrino mass matrix. A comparative study of the\nprecision in the measurement of oscillation parameters expected from the next\ngeneration solar, atmospheric, reactor and accelerator based experiments is\npresented. We discuss the potential of $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ experiments in\ndetermining the neutrino mass hierarchy and the importance of a better\n$\\theta_{12}$ measurement for it.\n", "  We examine low energy sparticle mass-spectrum and electroweak symmetry\nbreaking (EWSB) in the mixed modulus-anomaly mediation which is naturally\nrealized in KKLT flux compactification. We find that the anomaly-mediation\neffectively lowers messenger scale in the moduli-mediation and leads to\n'squeezed' mass-spectrum distinct from any known mediation mechanisms. The\nlightest neutralino typically becomes a mixed state of bino and higgsino or\npure higgsino, which has a considerable impact on the cold dark matter physics.\n", "  Using only independent high-scale OPE input, we investigate QCD sum rule\nconstraints on two currently incompatible versions of the I=1 vector spectral\nfunction, one obtained from electroproduction data, the other from hadronic tau\ndecay data. Sum rules involving weighted integrals over the spectral functions,\nfrom threshold to a variable upper endpoint, s_0,are employed. It is shown that\nboth the normalization and slope with respect to s_0 of the EM spectral\nintegrals disagree with the corresponding OPE expectations, while both the\nnormalization and slope are in good agreement when hadronic tau decay data is\nused instead. These results favor determinations of the leading order hadronic\nvacuum polarization contribution to a_mu obtained using the tau decay data, and\nhence Standard Model predictions for a_mu compatible with the current\nexperimental determination.\n", "  The ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider LHC is presented, and an\noverview of its physics program is given. A few specific observables are\ndiscussed in order to illustrate the physics potential of ALICE.\n", "  The anomaly-anomaly correlator is studied using QCD sum rules. Using the\nmatrix elements of anomaly between vacuum and pseudoscalars $\\pi, eta$ and\n$\\eta'$, the derivative of correlator $chi'(0)$ is evaluated and found to be\n$\\approx 1.82 \\times 10^{-3}$ GeV$^2$. Assuming that $\\chi'(0)$ has no\nsignificant dependence on quark masses, the mass of $\\eta'$ in the chiral limit\nis found to be $\\approx$723 MeV. The same calculation also yields for the\nsinglet pseudoscalar decay constant in the chiral limit a value of $\\approx\n178$ MeV.\n", "  I summarize the status of three--neutrino oscillations that follow from\ncombining the relevant world's data. The discussion includes the small\nparameters Delta_m-sol/Delta_m-atm and \\sin^2\\theta_{13}, which characterize\nthe strength of CP violation in neutrino oscillations, the impact of\noscillation data on the prospects for probing the absolute scale of neutrino\nmass in \\nbb and the robustness of the neutrino oscillation interpretation\nitself in the presence of non-standard physics. I also comment on the\ntheoretical origin of neutrino mass, mentioning recent attemps to explain\ncurrent oscillation data.\n", "  We investigate three different axial-vector form factors of the nucleon,\n$G_A^{0}$, $G_A^3$, $G_A^8$, within the framework of the SU(3) chiral\nquark-soliton model, emphasizing their strangeness content. We take into\naccount the rotational $1/N_c$ and linear strange quark ($m_s$) contributions\nusing the symmetry-conserving SU(3) quantization and assuming isospin symmetry.\nThe strange axial-vector form factor is also obtained and they all are\ndiscussed in the context of the parity-violating scattering of polarized\nelectrons off the nucleon and its relevance to the strange vector form factors.\n", "  Two-photon decays of rho and omega mesons and strong decays rho -> eta pi and\nomega -> pi pi are described in the quark Nambu-Jona-Lasinio(NJL) model in\ndense medium. Decays of rho-meson are especially interesting because they\ncontain intermediate a_0-meson which became a sharp resonance in the vicinity\nof phase transition of hadron matter into quark-gluon plasma. This leads to\nincreasing rho decay width and, as a result, two-photon decay of rho-meson in\nmedium became comparable with two-photon decays of scalar and pseudoscalar\nmesons in vacuum. Similar effect take place in the strong decay rho -> eta pi.\n", "  By adopting two models of strange and antistrange quark distributions inside\nnucleon, the light-cone meson-baryon fluctuation model and the effective chiral\nquark model, we calculate the $D_s^+ - D_s^-$ asymmetry in photoproduction in\nthe framework of heavy-quark recombination mechanism. We find that the effect\nof asymmetry of strange sea to the $D_s$ asymmetry is considerable and\ndepending on the different models. Therefore, we expect that with the further\nstudy in electroproduction, e.g. at HERA and CEBAF, the experimental\nmeasurements on the $D_s^+ - D_s^-$ asymmetry may impose a strong restriction\non the strange-antistrange distribution asymmetry models.\n", "  A mechanism of double protection of the Higgs potential, by supersymmetry and\nby a global symmetry, is investigated in a class of supersymmetric models with\nthe SU(3)xSU(3)xU(1) gauge symmetry. In such models the electroweak symmetry\ncan be broken with no fine-tuning at all.\n", "  The Dubna-Mainz-Taipei (DMT) dynamical model for pion electromagnetic\nproduction, which describe well the existing data from threshold up to 1 GeV\nphoton lab energy is presented and used to analyze recent data in the $\\Delta$\nregion . We find that within DMT model, the bare $\\Delta$ is almost spherical\nwhile the physical $\\Delta$ is oblate. The deformation is almost saturated by\nthe pion cloud effects.\n", "  In this write-up, I summarize the key ingredients of the vector manifestaion\nformulated in the hidden local symmetry theory, in which the $\\rho$ meson\nbecomes massless degenerated with the pion at the chiral phase transition\npoint.\n", "  We investigate the suppression of $\\pi^0$-spectrum in a wide range of\n$p_\\perp$ up 60 GeV/c which is caused by the energy loss of the gluon and quark\njets in quark-gluon plasma. The physical characteristics of initial and mixed\nphases were found in the effective quasiparticle model by analogy with previous\nwork \\cite{5}. The PHENIX data up 10 GeV/c within the limits of precision are\ndescribed by quasiparticle model with decrease of the thermal gluon mass and\neffective coupling in the region of phase transitin (at $T\\to T_c$ from above).\nWe also take into account the intrinsic transverse momentum $k_\\perp$ of\npartons.\n  The suppression factor $R_{AA}(p_\\perp)$ shows the weak rise with increase of\n$p_\\perp$ above 4 GeV/c, then it reaches smooth maximum at $p_\\perp \\sim 20$\nGeV/c and then decrease at $p_\\perp\\sim 60$ GeV/c again to value $R_{AA}$ at\n$p_\\perp\\simeq$ 4 GeV/c. The factor $R_{AA}$ in this range of $p_\\perp$ is\nchangihg weakly if intrinsic momentum $k_\\perp$ is taken into account.\n", "  Employing a newly developed pQCD inspired parton cascade we simulate the\nspace time evolution of gluons which are produced initially in a heavy ion\ncollision at RHIC energy. The inelastic $gg \\leftrightarrow ggg$ interactions\nare for the first time implemented obeying full detailed balance. The numerical\nresults show that thermalization of gluons is mainly driven by the inelastic\ngluonic interactions and reaches equilibrium at $1\\sim 2$ fm/c. In simulations\nfor noncentral collisions considerable partonic elliptic flow $v_2$ is\ngenerated being comparable with the experimental data.\n", "  Interactions of heavy quarks, in particular of top quarks, with electroweak\ngauge bosons are expected to be very sensitive to new physics effects related\nto electroweak symmetry breaking. These interactions are described by the\nso-called static form factors, which include anomalous magnetic moments and the\neffective weak charges. We compute the second-order QCD corrections to these\nstatic form factors, which turn out to be sizeable and need to be taken into\naccount in searches for new anomalous coupling effects.\n", "  We compute by numerical integration of the Dirac equation the number of\nquark-antiquark pairs produced in the classical color fields of colliding\nultrarelativistic nuclei. The backreaction of the created pairs on the color\nfields is not taken into account. While the number of qqbar pairs is\nparametrically suppressed in the coupling constant, we find that in this\nclassical field model it could even be compatible with the thermal ratio to the\nnumber of gluons. After isotropization one could thus have quark-gluon plasma\nin chemical equilibrium.\n", "  We present the next-to-leading order full results in Chiral Perturbation\nTheory for the charged Kaon K --> 3 pi slope g CP violating asymmetries. We\ndiscuss the constraints that a measurement of these asymmetries would impose on\nthe Standard Model results of epsilon_K' and search for new physics. We also\nstudy the kind of information that such measurement can provide on Im G_8, Im\n(e^2 G_E) and higher order weak couplings.\n", "  We investigate transition form factors between non-relativistic QCD bound\nstates at large recoil energy. Assuming the decaying quark to be much heavier\nthan its decay product, the relativistic dynamics can be treated according to\nthe factorization formula for heavy-to-light form factors obtained from the\nheavy-quark expansion in QCD. The non-relativistic expansion determines the\nbound-state wave functions to be Coulomb-like. As a consequence, one can\nexplicitly calculate the so-called ``soft-overlap'' contribution to the\ntransition form factor.\n", "  We review the experimental status of the b-quark production at the Fermilab\nTevatron. We compare all available measurements to perturbative QCD predictions\n(NLO and FONLL) and also to the parton-level cross section evaluated with\nparton-shower Monte Carlo generators. We examine both the single $b$ cross\nsection and the so called b bar{b} correlations. The review shows that the\nexperimental situation is quite complicated because the measurements appear to\nbe inconsistent among themselves. In this situation, there is no solid basis to\neither claim that perturbative QCD is challenged by these measurements or, in\ncontrast, that long-standing discrepancies between data and theory have been\nresolved by incrementally improving the measurements and the theoretical\nprediction.\n", "  Tree level unitarity violations of extra dimensional extensions of the\nStandard Model may become much stronger when the scalar sector is included in\nthe bulk. This effect occurs when the couplings are not suppressed for larger\nKaluza-Klein levels, and could have relevant consequences for the phenomenology\nof the next generation of colliders. We briefly review our formalism to obtain\nmore stringent unitarity bounds when KK modes are present, as well as the\ngeneralization to extra dimensions of the Equivalence Theorem between Goldstone\nbosons and longitudinal gauge bosons\n", "  I review recent theoretical progress in the resummation of small x\ncontributions to the evolution of parton distributions, in view of its\npotential significance for accurate phenomenology at future colliders. I show\nthat a consistent perturbative resummation of collinear and energy logs is now\npossible, and necessary if one wishes to use recent NNLO results in the HERA\nkinematic region.\n", "  We study the transverse spectra of hadrons in nearly central $AA$ collisions\nat RHIC and LHC in a broad transverse momentum range Low-$p_T$ spectra are\ncalculated by using boost-invariant hydrodynamics with initial energy and\nnet-baryon densities from the EKRT pQCD+saturation model. High-$p_T$ spectra\nare obtained from pQCD jet calculation including the energy loss of the parton\nin the matter prior to its fragmentation to final hadrons.\n", "  We discuss the need of a proton driver for the Fermilab neutrino oscillation\nprogram, as well as its role in the global context.\n", "  We discuss several potential applications of ``very'' long neutrino factory\nbaselines, as well as potential detector locations for these applications.\n", "  Jet quenching has been established as one of the main tools to study the\nproperties of the medium produced in heavy ion collisions. Most of the\nexperimental effort has been, up to now, on the measurements of inclusive\nparticle suppression. This observable suffers, however, of limitations due to\ndifferent trigger-bias effects. The study of jets (or particle correlations) in\na medium is the most promising way out for a better characterization of the\nmedium properties. I will present how these more differential measurements can\nbe used to study not only the density of the medium (the traditional parameter\nfixed by jet quenching measurements) but also more dynamical quantities as flow\nfields.\n", "  We argue that the electroproduction of exotic particles is a useful tool for\nstudy of their partonic structure. In the case of hybrid mesons, the magnitude\nof their cross sections shows that they are accessible for measurements in\nexisting electroproduction experiments.\n", "  Adding two color sextet quarks to QCD gives many special features. The\nhigh-energy S-Matrix, constructed via reggeon diagrams and chiral anomalies,\ncontains the Critical Pomeron and electroweak symmetry breaking is produced, by\nsextet pions. Cosmic ray phenomena suggest large cross-section effects will be\nseen at the LHC, in particular, involving the pomeron. The sextet sector\nembeds, uniquely, in a massless, confining, left-handed SU(5) theory. The\nanomaly based high-energy S-Matrix could be that of the full Standard Model.\n", "  We perform lattice calculations of the lightest J=0,2,4,6 glueball masses in\nthe D=3+1 SU(3) gauge theory and extrapolate to the continuum limit. Assuming\nthat these masses lie on linear Regge trajectories we find a leading glueball\ntrajectory alpha(t) = 0.93(24) + 0.28(2)alpha_R' t, where alpha_R' \\simeq 0.9\n{GeV}^{-2} is the slope of the usual mesonic Regge trajectories. This glueball\ntrajectory has an intercept and slope similar to that of the Pomeron. We\ncontrast this with the situation in D=2+1 where the leading glueball Regge\ntrajectory is found to have too small an intercept to be important for\nhigh-energy cross-sections. We attempt to interpret the observed states and\ntrajectories in terms of open and closed string models of glueballs.\n", "  We consider the Higgs boson production at high energy hadron colliders in the\nframework of the $k_T$-factorization approach. The attention is focused on the\ndominant gluon-gluon fusion subprocess. We show that $k_T$-factorization gives\na possibility to investigate the associated Higgs boson and jets production.\n", "  Direct detection dark matter experiments, lead by the CDMS collaboration,\nhave placed increasingly stronger constraints on the cross sections for elastic\nscattering of WIMPs on nucleons. These results impact the prospects for the\nindirect detection of dark matter using neutrino telescopes. With this in mind,\nwe revisit the prospects for detecting neutrinos produced by the annihilation\nof WIMPs in the Sun. We find that the latest bounds do not seriously limit the\nmodels most accessible to next generation kilometer-scale neutrino telescopes\nsuch as IceCube. This is largely due to the fact that models with significant\nspin-dependent couplings to protons are the least constrained and, at the same\ntime, the most promising because of the efficient capture of WIMPs in the Sun.\nWe identify models where dark matter particles are beyond the reach of any\nplanned direct detection experiments while within reach of neutrino telescopes.\nIn summary, we find that, even when contemplating recent direct detection\nresults, neutrino telescopes still have the opportunity to play an important as\nwell as complementary role in the search for particle dark matter.\n", "  We examine the violation of the kT factorization approximation for quark\nproduction in high energy proton-nucleus collisions. We comment on its\nimplications for the open charm and quarkonium production in collider\nexperiments.\n", "  We review hitherto attempts to look at the multiparticle production processes\nfrom the Information Theory point of view (both in its extensive and\nnonextensive versions).\n", "  This review starts with a brief introduction to the charged Higgs boson\n$(H^\\pm)$ in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). It then\ndiscusses the prospects of a relatively light $H^\\pm$ boson search via top\nquark decay and finally a heavy $H^\\pm$ boson search at LHC. The viable\nchannels for $H^\\pm$ search are discussed, with particular emphasis on the\n$H^\\pm -> tau+nu$ decay channel.\n", "  In this talk I will firstly review on the current constraints on the equation\nof state of the dark energy from observational data, then present a new\nscenario of dark energy dubbed {\\it Quintom}. The recent fits to the type Ia\nsupernova data and the cosmic microwave background and so on in the literature\nfind that the behavior of dark energy is to great extent in consistency with a\ncosmological constant, however the dynamical dark energy scenarios are\ngenerally not ruled out, and one class of models with an equation of state\ntransiting from below -1 to above -1 as the redshift increases is mildly\nfavored. The second part of the talk is on interacting dark energy. I will\nreview briefly on the models of neutrino dark energy.\n", "  Building on, and extending, the result of a higher-order in-medium chiral\nperturbation theory combined with renormalization group arguments and a variety\nof observations of the vector manifestation of Harada-Yamawaki hidden local\nsymmetry theory, we obtain a surprisingly simple description of kaon\ncondensation by fluctuating around the \"vector manifestation (VM)\" fixed point\nidentified to be the chiral restoration point. Our development establishes that\nstrangeness condensation takes place at about 3 n_0 where n_0 is nuclear matter\ndensity. This result depends only on the renoramlization-group (RG) behavior of\nthe vector interactions, other effects involved in fluctuating about the bare\nvacuum in so many previous calculations being \"irrelevant\" in the RG about the\nfixed point. Our results have major effects on the collapse of neutron stars\ninto black holes.\n", "  Chiral amplitudes for two jets processes in quasi-peripheral kinematics are\ncalculated at the Born and one loop correction level. The amplitudes of\nsubprocesses describing interaction of virtual and real photon with creation of\na charged fermion pair for various chiral states are considered in details.\nSimilar results are presented for Compton subprocess with virtual photon.\n  Contribution of emission of virtual, soft, and hard real additional photons\nare taken into account explicitly. The relevant cross sections expressed in\nterms of impact factors are in agreement with structure function approach in\nthe leading logarithmical approximation.\n  Contributions of the next to leading terms are presented in an analytical\nform. Accuracy estimation is discussed.\n", "  A short review of both theoretical and experimental aspects of the radiative\nreturn method is presented. It is emphasised that the method gives not only\npossibility of the independent from the scan method measurement of the hadronic\ncross section, but also can provide information concerning details of the\nhadronic interactions. New developments in the PHOKHARA event generator are\nalso reviewed. The 3 pion and kaon pair production is implemented within the\nversion 5.0 of the program, together with contributions of the radiative phi\ndecays to the 2 pion final states.\n  Missing NLO radiative corrections to the e+e- -> mu+ mu- gamma process will\nbe implemented in the forthcoming version of the generator.\n", "  Neutrino masses have been extensively studied in the context of discrete\nsymmetries. A family permutation symmetry easily explains all neutrino\noscillations and their mixing angles. However it is not obvious the embedding\nof such symmetry in a grand unified theory where all fermions live in the same\nrepresentation. We show that it is possible to embed such a horizontal discrete\nsymmetry in a grand unified theory. We discuss an E_6\n  GUT model as in [1], but differently from [1], we take the SM Higgs doublet\nin the 351' to have (+3,+5) charges with respect the additional U(1)_r X\nU(1)_t. This choice makes possible two different horizontal symmetry breaking\npatterns and a distinction between neutrinos and the rest of matter fermions.\n", "  At sufficiently small $x$ where pQCD methods become insufficient we rewrote\nsum of dominant Feynman diagrams for single-scale hard processes in the form of\nthe effective field theory where a quasiparticle corresponds to pQCD ladder. We\nexplain that pQCD series are divergent at small $x$ since pQCD produces tachyon\nin effective field theory and because of degeneracy of vacua . Within the WKB\napproximation we found the hierarchy among quasiparticle interactions due to\nsmallness of the QCD coupling constant which justifies restriction by the\ntriple quasiparticle interaction in the Lagrangean of effective field theory.\n  Degeneracy of vacua is removed by accounting for the classical solutions\n-kinks which cannot be decomposed into series over powers f $\\alpha_s$ but\ndescribe color inflation, Bose-Einstein condensation of quasiparticles. Quantum\nfluctuations around the WKB solution lead to the spontaneous violation of\ntwo-dimensional translation symmetry and the appearance of zero modes-\n``phonons'' which are relevant for the black disc behaviour of small x\nprocesses. Account of gluon exchanges between overlapping ladders neglected in\nthe first approximation produces a color network occupying a \"macroscopic\"\nlongitudinal volume. We discuss briefly possible role of new\n  QCD phenomena in the two-scale hard processes .\n", "  In this paper we report on a systematic search for a neutral boson in the\nmass range between 5 and 15 MeV/c$^{2}$ in the decay of highly excited nuclei.\nIts signature is found a deviation in the angular correlation of the $e^+e^-$\npairs from conventional internal pair conversion (IPC) resulting from of its\ntwo-body decay kinematics. With an $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair-spectrometer, a number of\ntransitions has been investigated in the\n  ${\\alpha}$--nuclei $^{8}$Be, $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O, following light ion\ninduced reactions at low bombarding energies, first at IKF in Frankfurt and\nduring the last years at ATOMKI in Debrecen. Startlingly, in all isoscalar\ntransitions excess $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs are found at large angles with branching\nratios with respect to the total yield ranging from 10$^{-2}$ to 10$^{-6}$. If\nthese deviations are all related to the two-body decay of an $X$-boson, this\nobservation implies plural $X$-bosons. An analysis of all angular spectra with\na boson search program, yields a pandemonium of more than ten candidate bosons.\n", "  The little Higgs scenario may provide an interesting framework to accommodate\nTeV scale leptogenesis because a TeV Majorana mass of the right-handed neutrino\nthat we employ for the latter may find a natural place near the ultraviolet\ncutoff of the former. In this work we study how a light neutrino spectrum,\ngenerated radiatively, and TeV scale leptogenesis can be embedded in the\nsimplest little\n  Higgs framework. Alternatively, we highlight how the neutrino Yukawa textures\nof the latter are constrained.\n", "  We propose a scenario of thermal leptogenesis at the TeV scale in the context\nof an extension of the Standard Model with 4 generations. We also add one\nright-handed Majorana neutrino for each generation to generate left handed\nneutrino masses via see-saw. The r\\^{o}le of the fourth lepton doublet is not\nmuch different from that of a supersymmetric partner, so the leptogenesis\nconsequences of a four generation scenario are indicators of a more generic\npicture. We obtain a value for the baryon asymmetry of the\n  Universe in accordance with observations by solving the full set of coupled\nBoltzmann equations for this model.\n", "  We present recent results of the rare semileptonic decay B -> X_s l+ l-. We\nparticularly focus on higher order electroweak corrections in the Standard\nModel (SM) as well as O(alpha_s) corrections in Two-Higgs-doublet models\n(THDM), both of which are computed within an effective field theory approach.\n  The calculation of higher order electroweak corrections reveals the presence\nof enhanced electromagnetic logarithms log(m_b^2/m_l^2) in the differential\nbranching ratio. The inclusion of O(alpha_s) in the THDM reduces the scale\ndependence of the corresponding Wilson coefficients significantly.\n", "  We show that non-singlets in semi-inclusive DIS with pi^\\pm determine without\nassumptions Delta u_V, Delta d_V and D_u^{\\pi+ - pi-}. Non-singlets in SIDIS\nand inclusive e+e- -annihilation with K^\\pm determine (s-bar s) and (Delta\ns-Delta bar s), but an assumption is necessary -- we choose as most natural\nD_d^{K+ - K-}=0.\n  Measurements with charged K^\\pm and neutral K0+bar K0 in semi-inclusive DIS\nand e+e--annihilation determine\n  D_{u,d,s}^{K+ + K-} without any assumptions and allow tests of LO\napproximation in QCD.\n", "  We provide a simple Regge parametrization of forward hadronic scattering from\nthe multi-TeV range down to approximately 1 GeV above the threshold of each\nreaction.\n  We show how, at these relatively low energies, mass effects are relevant and\nshould be properly taken into account, and that the data favor a logarithmic\ngrowth of the Pomeron contribution that is based on an improved unitarity bound\nat intermediate energies as well as a separate factorization of the\nsingularities. Data on both the imaginary and real parts of amplitudes are\nremarkably well described with this parametrization. Here we also show that the\ndescription does not depend on the strategy adopted to include or not\nsystematic uncertainties in different data sets.\n", "  Inspired by the small longitudinal polarizations (LPs) of $B\\to K^* \\phi$\ndecays observed by BELLE and BABAR, we revise the theoretical uncertainties of\nperturbative QCD approach for determining hard scales of B decays, we find that\nthe LPs of $B\\to K^* \\phi$ could approach to 60% while the branching ratios\n(BRs) could be around $9\\times 10^{-6}$. In addition, we also study the BRs and\npolarization fractions of $B\\to \\rho (\\omega) \\rho (\\omega)$ and $B\\to \\rho\n(\\omega) K^*$ decays. For those tree dominant and color-allowed processes in\n$B\\to \\rho (\\omega) \\rho (\\omega)$ decays, we get that the BRs of $(\\rho^{+}\n\\rho^{-}, \\rho^{0} \\rho^{+}, \\omega \\rho^{+})$ are $(23.06, 11.99, 14.78)\\times\n10^{-6}$ while their LPs are close to unity. Interestingly, due to significant\ntree contributions, we find that the BR(LP) of $\\rho^{-} K^{*+}$ could be\naround $10.13 \\times 10^{-6}(60%)$; and due to the tree and electroweak\npenguin, the BR(LP) of $\\omega K^{*+}$ could be around $5.67 \\times\n10^{-6}(61%)$.\n", "  The gauge coupling unification is one of main motivations in the split-SUSY\nscenario, and the existence of the grand unified theories (GUTs) is assumed. We\nexamine how to realize split-SUSY mass spectrum in the context of GUTs and find\nthat the construction of split-SUSY GUTs is by no means straightforward. With\nR-symmetry breaking sources in the GUT sector,\n  GUT particles play a role of the messengers in the gauge mediation scenario\nand their contributions to gaugino masses can be sizable. We find the upper\nbound on soft scalar masses of\n  O(10^{10}) GeV from consistency for constructing the split-SUSY GUT. Also, we\ndiscuss the attempt to construct R-symmetric GUT models.\n", "  The recent failure of the scenario which uses only $\\mathbf{10,\\oot}$ Higgs\nmultiplets to yield large enough neutrino masses in the $\\mathbf{SO(10) }$\n  \\textbf{MSGUT} motivates an alternative scenario\\cite{blmdoom} where the\n$\\mathbf{120}$ -plet collaborates with the $ \\mathbf{10}$ -plet to fit the\ndominant charged fermion masses. The small $\\mathbf{\\oot} $ -plet couplings\ngive appreciable contributions only to light charged fermion masses\n{\\textit{and}} enhance the Type I seesaw masses to viable values. We analyze\nthe 2-3 generation core of the complete hierarchical fermion mass system in the\nCP conserving approximation. \\emph{Ansatz} consistency \\emph{requires}\n${\\mathbf{m_b-m_s = m_{\\tau}-m_{\\mu}}} $ at the GUT scale $M_X$ and predicts\nnear maximal (PMNS) mixing in the leptonic sector for central values of charged\nfermion parameters and for wide ranges of the other relevant parameters :\nrighthanded neutrino masses and relative strength of contributions of the two\ndoublet pairs from the $\\mathbf{120}$-plet to the effective MSSM Higgs pair.\nThese features are preserved in the CP preserving 3 generation system whose\nresults are previewed : an additional consistency requirement\n$\\mathbf{\\theta_{13}^c =\\theta_{12}^c \\theta_{23}^c }$ on the CKM angles at\n$M_X$ arises for 3 generations. Right handed neutrino masses in such scenarios\nare all less than about $10^{12} GeV$.\n", "  We study the impacts of nonuniversal $Z^{\\prime}$ model, providing flavor\nchanging neutral current at tree level, on the branching ratios (BRs), CP\nasymmetries (CPAs) and polarization fractions of B decays. We find that for\nsatisfying the current data, the new left- and right-handed couplings have to\nbe included at the same time. The new introduced effective interactions not\nonly could effectively explain the puzzle of small longitudinal polarization in\n$B\\to K^* \\phi$ decays, but also provide a solution to the small CPA of\n$B^{\\pm}\\to \\pi^{0} K^{\\pm}$. We also find that the favorable CPA of\n$B^{\\pm}\\to \\pi^{0} K^{\\pm}$ is opposite in sign to the standard model;\nmeanwhile, the CPA of $B_{d}\\to \\pi^{0}K$ has to be smaller than -10%. In\naddition, by using the values of parameters which are constrained by $B\\to \\pi\nK$, we find that the favorable ranges of BRs, CPAs, longitudinal polarizations,\nand perpendicular transverse polarizations for $(B^{\\pm}\\to \\rho^{\\pm} K^{*},\nB_{d}\\to \\rho^{\\mp} K^{*\\pm})$ are $(17.1\\pm 3.9, 10.0\\pm2.0)\\times 10^{-6}$,\n$(3\\pm 5, 21\\pm 7)%$, $(0.66\\pm 0.10, 0.44\\pm 0.08)$ and $(0.14\\pm 0.10,\n0.25\\pm 0.09)$, respectively.\n", "  In the 5D theory in which only 3 generation right-handed neutrinos are in the\nbulk, the neutrino flavor mixings and the mass spectrum can be constructed\nthrough the seesaw mechanism. The 5D seesaw is easily calculated just by a\nreplacement of the\n  Majorana mass eigenvalues, M_i, by 2 M_*tan(h)[\\pi RM_i] (M_*: 5D Planck\nscale,\n  R: compactification radius). The 5D features appear when the bulk mass, which\ninduces the 4D Majorana mass, is the same as the compactification scale or\nlarger than it. Depending on the type of bulk mass, the seesaw scales of the 3\ngenerations are strongly split (the tan-function case) or degenerate (the\ntanh-function case). In the split case, the seesaw enhancement is naturally\nrealized. The single right-handed neutrino dominance works in a simple setup,\nand some specific mass textures, which are just assumptions in the 4D setup,\ncan be naturally obtained in\n  5 dimensions. The degenerate case is also useful for a suitable neutrino\nflavor structure.\n", "  We consider neutrino oscillations as non stationary phenomenon based on\nSchrodinger evolution equation and mixed neutrino states with definite flavor.\n  We demonstrate that for such states invariance under translations in time\ndoes not take place. We show that time-energy uncertainty relation plays a\ncrucial role in neutrino oscillations. We compare neutrino oscillations with\n$K^{0}\\leftrightarrows\\bar K^{0}$, $B_{d}^{0}\\leftrightarrows\\bar B_{d}^{0}$\netc oscillations.\n", "  We point out that gauge bosons emissions should be carefully estimated when\nconsidering LHC observables, since real $Ws$ and $Zs$ contributions can\ndramatically change cross sections with respect to tree level values.\n  Here we consider observables that are fully inclusive respect to soft gauge\nbosons emission and where a certain number of nonabelian isospin charges in\ninitial and/or final states are detected. We set up a general formalism to\nevaluate leading, all order resummed electroweak corrections and we consider\nthe phenomenologically relevant case of third family quark production at the\nLHC. In the case of $b\\bar{t}$ production we find that, due to the interplay\nbetween strong and weak interactions, the production cross section can become\nan order of magnitude bigger than the tree level value.\n", "  We present in analytic form the O(alpha_s^5) correction to the H->gg partial\nwidth of the standard-model Higgs boson with intermediate mass M_H<2M_t. Its\nknowledge is useful because the O(alpha_s^4) correction is sizeable (around\n20%). For M_H=120 GeV, the resulting QCD correction factor reads\n  1 + (215/12) alpha_s^(5)(M_H)/pi\n  + 152.5 (alpha_s^(5)(M_H)/pi)^2\n  + 381.5 (alpha_s^(5)(M_H)/pi)^3\n  \\approx 1+0.65+0.20+0.02.\n  The new four-loop correction increases the total Higgs-boson hadronic width\nby a small amount of order 1 promille and stabilizes significantly the residual\nscale dependence.\n", "  We calculate the lowest order QCD amplitude, i.e. the quark exchange\ncontribution, to the forward production amplitude of a pair of longitudinally\npolarized $\\rho$ mesons in the scattering of two virtual photons $\\gamma^*(Q_1)\n\\gamma^*(Q_2) \\to \\rho^0_L \\rho^0_L$. We show that the scattering amplitude\nsimultaneously factorizes in two quite different ways: the part with transverse\nphotons is described by the QCD factorization formula involving the generalized\ndistribution amplitude of two final $\\rho$ mesons, whereas the part with\nlongitudinally polarized photons takes the QCD factorized form with the\n  $\\gamma^*_L \\to \\rho^0_L$ transition distribution amplitude. Perturbative\nexpressions for these, in general, non-perturbative functions are obtained in\nterms of the $\\rho-$meson distribution amplitude.\n", "  The recent discovery that neutrinos have masses opens a wide new field of\nexperimentation. Accelerator-made neutrinos are essential in this program.\nIdeas for future facilities include high intensity muon neutrino beams from\npion decay (`SuperBeam'), electron neutrino beams from nuclei decays (`Beta\nBeam'), or muon and electron neutrino beams from muon decay (`Neutrino\nFactory'), each associated with one or several options for detector systems.\nEach option offers synergetic possibilities, e.g. some of the detectors can be\nused for proton decay searches, while the Neutrino Factory is a first step\ntowards muon colliders.\n  A summary of the perceived virtues and shortcomings of the various options,\nand a number of open questions are presented.\n", "  A non--singlet QCD analysis of the structure function $F_2(x,q^2)$ in LO,\nNLO, NNLO and N$^3$LO is performed based on the world data for charged lepton\nscattering. We determine the valence quark parton densities and present their\nparameterization and that of the correlated errors in a wide range of $x$ and\n$Q^2$. In the analysis we determined the QCD--scale $\\Lambda_{\\rm QCD, N_f =\n4}^{\\bar{\\rm MS}} = 265 \\pm 27 \\MeV {\\rm (NLO)}, 226 \\pm 25 \\MeV {\\rm (NNLO)},\n234 \\pm 26 \\MeV {\\rm (N^3LO)}$, with a remainder uncertainty of $\\pm 2\\MeV$ for\nthe yet unknown 4--loop anomalous dimension, corresponding to $\\alpha_s(M_Z^2)\n= 0.1148 \\pm 0.0019 {\\rm NLO}, 0.1134 {\\tiny{\\begin{array}{c} +0.0019 -0.0021\n\\end{array}}} {\\rm NNLO}, 0.1141 {\\tiny{\\begin{array}{c} +0.0020 -0.0022\n\\end{array}}} {\\rm N^3LO}$. A comparison is performed to other determinations\nof the QCD scale and $\\alpha_s(M_Z^2)$ in deeply inelastic scattering. The\nhigher twist contributions of $F_2^p(x,Q^2)$ and $F_2^d(x,Q^2)$ are extracted\nin the large $x$ region, subtracting the twist--2 contributions obtained in the\nNLO, NNLO and N$^3$LO analysis.\n", "  Measurement of the Yukawa interaction between the top quark and the Higgs\nboson should be useful to clarify the mechanism of fermion mass generation.\n  We discuss the impact of non-standard interactions characterized by\ndimension-six operators on the effective top Yukawa coupling.\n  The cross section of the process $e^-e^+ \\to W^-W^+ \\nu \\bar \\nu \\to t \\bar t\n\\nu \\bar \\nu$ is calculated including these operators, and possible deviation\nfrom the standard model prediction is evaluated under the constraint from\nperturbative unitarity and current experimental data.\n  We find that if the new physics scale is in a TeV region, the cross section\ncan be significantly enhanced due to the non-standard interactions.\n  Such a large effect should be detectable at the International Linear\nCollider.\n", "  We propose a natural framework of\n  SU(5) supersymmetric grand unified theory with the minimal particle contents,\nwhich does not contain dimension five proton decay operators. The suitable\nfermion mass hierarchy can be reproduced by higher dimensional operators of an\nadjoint Higgs field which breaks\n  SU(5) gauge symmetry.\n", "  We show the universal seesaw in the extra dimension setup, where three extra\nvector-like fields exist in the 5D bulk with heavy masses. We take the\nframework of the left-right symmetric model. The universal seesaw formula is\neasily obtained as a replacement of the vector-like mass in 4D case M_i to\n  2 M_* tan[pi RM_i] (M_*: 5D Planck scale,\n  M_i: vector-like bulk mass, and\n  R: compactification radius). The smallness of Dirac neutrino mass can be\nnaturally explained in the 5D setup. We also show the Majorana neutrino case.\n", "  In this talk I address three topics related to the shape of hadrons:\n  1. The Lorentz contraction of bound states. Few dedicated studies of this\nexist - I describe a recent calculation for ordinary atoms (positronium).\n  2. Does the A-dependence of nuclear structure functions indicate a change of\nproton shape in the nuclear environment? (My short answer is no.)\n  3. The size of Fock states contributing to processes involving large momentum\ntransfers. End-point configurations can be transversally extended and yet\nsufficiently short-lived to contribute coherently to hard scattering.\n", "  Within the light-quark sector of the standard model, P-odd observables are\ngenerated from point-like electroweak processes while A_t- odd observables\n(neglecting quark mass parameters) come from dynamic spin-orbit correlations\nwithin hadrons or within larger composite systems, such as nuclei. The effects\nof A_t-odd dynamics can be inserted into transverse-momentum dependent\nconstituent distribution functions and, in this paper, we construct the\ncontribution from an orbital quark to the A_t odd quark parton distribution.\nUsing this distribution, we examine the crucial role of initial- and\nfinal-state interactions in the observation of the scattering asymmetries in\ndifferent hard-scattering processes. This construction provides a geometrical\nand dynamical interpretation of the Collins conjugation relation between\nsingle-spin asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and the\nasymmetries in Drell-Yan production. Finally, our construction allows us to\ndisplay a significant difference between the calculation of a spin asymmetry\ngenerated by a hard scattering mechanism involving color-singlet exchange (such\nas a photon) and a calculation of an asymmetry with a hard-scattering exchange\ninvolving gluons. This leads to an appreciation of the process dependence\ninherent in measurements of single-spin observables.\n", "  The branching ratios and CP asymmetries of\n  $B\\to \\pi\\pi$ decays measured in B factory experiments indicate a large ratio\nof color-suppressed ($C$) to color-allowed ($T$) tree contributions and a large\nrelative phase between the tree and penguin amplitude. In this talk, I would\nlike to report on a recent analysis to see whether the large $C/T$ ratio can be\nexplained within the QCD based model with i) a large contribution from the\nannihilation terms or with ii) large final-state-interaction phase between two\ndifferent isospin amplitudes. We show that the current experimental data do not\nexclude either possibility but we may be able to distinguish these two effects\nin future measurements of direct CP asymmetry in $B\\to \\pi^{0}\\pi^{0}$ decay.\n", "  The recent WMAP data have confirmed that exotic dark matter together with the\nvacuum energy (cosmological constant) dominate in the flat Universe. Thus the\ndirect dark matter search, consisting of detecting the recoiling nucleus, is\ncentral to particle physics and cosmology. Modern particle theories naturally\nprovide viable cold dark matter candidates with masses in the GeV-TeV region.\nSupersymmetry provides the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), theories in\nextra dimensions the lightest Kaluza-Klein particle (LKP) etc. In such theories\nthe expected rates are much lower than the present experimental goals. So one\nshould exploit characteristic signatures of the reaction, such as the\nmodulation effect and, in directional experiments, the correlation of the event\nrates with the sun's motion.\n  In standard non directional experiments the modulation is small, less than\ntwo per cent and the location of the maximum depends on the unknown particle's\nmass.\n  In directional experiments, in addition to the forward-backward asymmetry due\nto the sun's motion, one expects a larger modulation, which depends on the\ndirection of observation. We study such effects both in the case of a light and\na heavy target. Furthermore, since it now appears that the planned experiments\nwill be partly directional, in the sense that they can only detect the line of\nthe recoiling nucleus, but not the sense of direction on it, we study which of\nthe above mentioned interesting features, if any, will persist in these less\nambitious experiments.\n", "  The ``asymmetric'' matrix element <p-r|G...G|p> that appears in the pQCD\ndescription of hard diffractive electroproduction does not coincide with that\ndefining the gluon distribution function f_g(x). I outline a pQCD formalism\nbased on a concept of the double distribution F_g(x,y), which specifies the\nfractions xp, yr, (1-y)r of the initial proton momentum p and the momentum\ntransfer r, resp., carried by the gluons. For $t \\equiv r^2 =0$, r is\nproportional to p: $r = \\zeta p$, and it is convenient to parameterize the\nmatrix element <p-r|G...G|p> by an asymmetric distribution function ${\\cal\nF}_{\\zeta}^g (X)$ depending on the total fractions $X \\equiv x+y \\zeta$ and\n$X-\\zeta = x- (1-y) \\zeta$ of the initial hadron momentum p carried by the\ngluons.I formulate evolution equations for ${\\cal F}_{\\zeta}^g (X)$, study some\nof their general properties and discuss the relationship between ${\\cal\nF}_{\\zeta}^g (X)$, F_g(x,y) and f_g(x).\n", "  The identification of problematic meson states as the members of the quark\nmodel $q\\bar{q}$ nonets by using a hadronic resonance spectrum is discussed.\nThe results favor the currently adopted $q\\bar{q}$ assignments for the\naxial-vector, tensor, and 1 $^3F_4$ $J^{PC}=4^{++}$ meson nonets, and suggest a\nnew $q\\bar{q}$ assignment for the scalar meson nonet which favors the\ninterpretation of the $f_0(980)$ and $f_0(1710)$ mesons as non-$q\\bar{q}$\nobjects. We also suggest that the 2 $^3S_1$ $\\frac{1}{2}(1^{-})$ state should\nbe identified with the $K^\\ast (1680)$ rather than $K^\\ast (1410)$ meson.\n", "  The standard requirement for the production of baryons at the electroweak\nphase transition, that the phase transition be first order and the sphaleron\nbound be satisfied, is predicated on the assumption of a radiation dominated\nuniverse at that epoch. One simple alternative - domination by the energy in a\nkinetic mode of a scalar field which scales as $1/a^6$ - gives a significantly\nweakened sphaleron bound for the preservation of a baryon asymmetry produced at\na first-order phase transition, and allows the possibility that the observed\nbaryon asymmetry be produced when the phase transition is second-order or\ncross-over. Such a phase of `kination' at the electroweak scale can occur in\nvarious ways as a scalar field evolves in an exponential potential after\ninflation.\n", "  I summarize a part of the work done with Bamert, Burgess, London and Nardi\n(hep-ph/9602438) in which we find simplified expressions for the possible\none-loop contributions to the $R_b$ parameter from new virtual particles,\nincluding supersymmetric ones. Our expressions make it easier to identify which\nmodels and choices of parameters are best able to solve the $R_b$ problem.\n", "  As a first step toward circumventing the difficulty to obtain an attractive\nisospin-independent NN spin-orbit force from Skyrme-type models involving only\npions, we investigate an improved Skyrme Lagrangian that incorporates the\nscalar-isoscalar meson \\epsilon which can be viewed as the cause behind the\nenhancement of the $\\pi \\pi S$-wave. We find that at large distances, the main\ncontribution to the spin-orbit potential comes from the scalar Lagrangian and\nit is found to be attractive. We briefly discuss how to pursue this work to\nfinally obtain a medium-range attractive interaction.\n", "  There are numerous examples of very nearly degenerate states of opposite\nparity in molecular physics. The ammonia maser is based on one such double.\nTheory shows that these parity doubles can occur if the nuclear shape in the\nmolecule is reflection-asymmetric because the time scales of the shape and the\nelectronic cloud are well-separated. Parity doubles occur in nuclear physics as\nwell for odd $A \\sim 219-229$. We discuss the theoretical foundation of these\ndoubles and on that basis suggest that parity doubles should occur in particle\nphysics too. In particular they should occur among baryons composed of $cbu$\nand $cbd$ quarks.\n", "  We study the screening of static electric fields in massless scalar\nelectrodynamics at high temperature and zero chemical potential. Effective\nfield theory methods are used to separate the contributions from the momentum\nscales T and eT to the electric screening mass. The effects of the distance\nscale 1/T are encoded in the parameters of an effective three-dimensional field\ntheory. The parameters of the effective Lagrangian can be written as a power\nseries in e^2. The contribution to physical quantities from the scale 1/eT can\nbe calculated from perturbation theory in the effective theory and is an\nexpansion in e starting at e^3. The electric screening mass squared is computed\nto order e^4\n", "  Using the gaussian representation for propagators (which can be proved to be\nexact in the infinite number of loops limit) we are able to derive the Regge\nbehaviour for ladder graphs of $\\phi^3$ field theory in a completely new way.\nAn analytic expression for the Regge trajectory $\\alpha (t/m^2)$ is found in\nterms of the mean-values of the Feynman $\\alpha$-parameters. $\\alpha (t/m^2)$\nis calculated in the range $- 3.6 < t/m^2 < 0.8$. The intercept $\\alpha (0)$\nagrees with that obtained from earlier calculations using the Bethe-Salpeter\napproach for $\\alpha (0) \\gsim 0.3$.\n", "  Our results for the primordial abundance of a massive Majorana tau neutrino\n(hep-ph/9603201) published in PRL76, 2848 (1996) were incorrect due to a\ntrivial (but annoying) error in the numerical code. In this ERRATUM we present\nthe corrected results.\n", "  The first reports of $\\psi$ and $\\psi'$ production from experiment NA50 at\nthe CERN SPS are compared to predictions based on a hadronic model of\ncharmonium suppression. Data on centrality dependence and total cross sections\nare in good accord with these predictions.\n", "  It has been pointed out by Shlyakhter that data from the natural fission\nreactors which operated about two billion years ago at Oklo (Gabon) had the\npotential of providing an extremely tight bound on the variability of the\nfine-structure constant alpha. We revisit the derivation of such a bound by:\n(i) reanalyzing a large selection of published rare-earth data from Oklo, (ii)\ncritically taking into account the very large uncertainty of the temperature at\nwhich the reactors operated, and (iii) connecting in a new way (using isotope\nshift measurements) the Oklo-derived constraint on a possible shift of thermal\nneutron-capture resonances with a bound on the time variation of alpha. Our\nfinal (95% C.L.) results are:\n  -0.9 \\times 10^{-7} <(alpha^{Oklo} - alpha^{now})/alpha <1.2\\times 10^{-7}\n  and -6.7 \\times 10^{-17} {yr}^{-1} < {\\dot alpha}^{averaged}/alpha\n<5.0\\times10^{-17} {yr}^{-1}$.\n", "  In standard ETC models the sideways and diagonal ETC interactions contribute\nto $\\delta R_b$ with opposite signs. The aim of this article is to study the\nimplications of the CDF value for m_t and the LEP value for R_b on $zt\\bar{t}$\ncouplings where the LH sideways and diagonal ETC effects interfere\nconstructively. We find that for m_t=175 Gev, $\\delta R_b =.0022$ and\nm^2_s=m^2_d, F^t_v and F^t_a are modified by 19% and 7% respectively from their\nSM values. The constrains implied by these deviations on diagonal ETC scenarios\nand the feasibility of probing them at NLC through polarization and angular\ndistribution studies in $e^+e^- \\to t\\bar{t}$ are also considered.\n", "  We show that MS bar perturbation theory develops tachyonic singularities for\nsome value of the dimensional regularization scale mu unless the physical Higgs\nmass exceeds some (cutoff dependent) minimum value.\n", "  The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element |V_ub| can be extracted from the\nrate for the semi-leptonic decay B -> pi + l + antineutrino_l, with little\ntheoretical uncertainty, provided the hadronic form factor for the B -> pi\ntransition can be measured from some other B decay. In here, we suggest using\nthe decay B -> pi J\\psi. This is a color suppressed decay, and it cannot be\nproperly described within the usual factorization approximation; we use instead\na simple and very general phenomenological model for the b d J\\psi vertex. In\norder to relate the hadronic form factors in the B -> pi J\\psi and B -> pi + l\n+ antineutrino_l decays, we use form factor relations that hold for\nheavy-to-light transitions at large recoil.\n", "  The perturbative calculation of the lifetime of fermion excitations in a QED\nplasma at high temperature is plagued with infrared divergences which are not\neliminated by the screening corrections. The physical processes responsible for\nthese divergences are the collisions involving the exchange of longwavelength,\nquasistatic, magnetic photons, which are not screened by plasma effects. The\nleading divergences can be resummed in a non-perturbative treatement based on a\ngeneralization of the Bloch-Nordsieck model at finite temperature. The\nresulting expression of the fermion propagator is free of infrared problems,\nand exhibits a {\\it non-exponential} damping at large times: $S_R(t)\\sim\n\\exp\\{-\\alpha T t \\ln\\omega_pt\\}$, where $\\omega_p=eT/3$ is the plasma\nfrequency and $\\alpha=e^2/4\\pi$.\n", "  BHAGEN-1PH is a FORTRAN program providing fast Monte Carlo event generation\nof the process $e^+ e^- \\to e^+ e^- \\gamma$, within electroweak theory, for\nboth unpolarized beams and also for the longitudinally polarized electron beam.\nThe program is designed for final leptons outside a small cone around the\ninitial leptons direction and has a new algorithm allowing also for a fast\ngeneration of non collinear initial and final emission, as well as for\nasymmetric and different angular cuts for final leptons.\n", "  We describe the calculation of the $B\\rightarrow \\pi$ hadronic matrix element\nfrom operator product expansion near the light-cone in QCD. In the resulting\nsum rules, the form factors $f^+$ and $F_0$ determining this matrix element are\nexpressed in terms of pion light-cone wave functions. We present predictions\nfor $f^+$ and $F_0$ in the region of momentum transfer $0 \\leq p^2 < m_b^2 -\n{\\cal O}(\\mbox{1 GeV}^2)$ taking into account the wave functions up to twist 4.\nWe also discuss the extrapolation of the form factors to higher $p^2$ and their\nasymptotic dependence on the heavy quark mass.\n", "  We investigate the possibility to measure the spin content carried by the\ndifferent quark flavors in a nucleon by means of polarized deep inelastic\nscattering with $W^\\pm$ exchange at HERA. Such measurements require a polarized\nproton beam. The expected inclusive and semi inclusive asymmetries are sizable\nand for realistic luminosities the expected statistical accuracies are good\nenough to extract new and relevant information on the valence quark and the\nstrange sea distributions.\n", "  We identify the leading s-wave amplitudes of the SU(3) chiral meson-baryon\nLagrangian with an effective coupled-channel potential which is iterated in a\nLippmann-Schwinger equation. The strangeness $S=-1$ resonance $\\Lambda(1405)$\nand the $S_{11}(1535)$ nucleon resonance emerge as quasi-bound states of\nanti-kaon/nucleon and kaon/$\\Sigma$-hyperon. Our approach to meson\nphotoproduction introduces no new parameters. By adjusting a few finite range\nparameters we are able to simultaneously describe a large amount of low energy\ndata. These include the cross sections of $K^-p$ elastic and inelastic\nscattering, the cross sections of eta meson and kaon photoproduction from\nnucleons as well as those of pion induced production of etas and kaons (16\ndifferent reaction channels altogether).\n", "  We analyze the one-loop effects (strong and electroweak) on the\nunconventional top quark decay mode $t\\rightarrow H^{+} b$ within the MSSM. The\nresults are presented in the on-shell renormalization scheme with a physically\nwell motivated definition of $\\tan\\beta$. The study of this process at the\nquantum level is useful to unravel the potential supersymmetric nature of the\ncharged Higgs emerging from that decay. As compared with the standard mode\n$t\\rightarrow W^{+} b$, the corrections to $t\\rightarrow H^{+} b$ are large,\nslowly decoupling and persist at a sizeable level even for all sparticle masses\nwell above the LEP 200 discovery range. As a matter of fact, the potential size\nof the SUSY effects, which amount to corrections of several ten percent, could\ncounterbalance the standard QCD corrections and even make them to appear with\nthe ``wrong'' sign. Therefore, if the charged Higgs decay of the top quark is\nkinematically allowed -a possibility which is not excluded by the recent\nmeasurements of the branching ratio $BR(t\\rightarrow W^{+} b)$ at the Tevatron\n- it could be an invaluable laboratory to search for ``virtual'' supersymmetry.\nWhile a first significant test of these effects could possibly be performed at\nthe upgraded Tevatron, a more precise verification would most likely be carried\nout in future experiments at the LHC.\n", "  Fragmentation functions for heavy-light mesons, like the charmed D, D^*\nmesons, are proposed. They rest on next-to-leading QCD Perturbative\nFragmentation Functions for heavy quarks, with the addition of a\nnon-perturbative term describing phenomenologically the quark --> meson\ntransition. The cross section for production of large p_T D, D^* mesons at the\nTevatron is evaluated in this framework.\n", "  We report on an extensive global QCD analysis of new DIS and hadronic\ninclusive jet production data emphasizing the impact of these recent data on\nthe determination of the gluon distribution, and on the interpretation of the\nhigh $E_t$ jets highlighted by the CDF collaboration. This analysis results in\n(i) a better handle on the range of uncertainty of the gluon distribution, (ii)\na new generation of CTEQ parton distributions which incorporates this\nuncertainty, (iii) a viable scenario for accommodating the high $E_t$ jets in\nthe conventional pQCD framework, and (iv) a systematic study of the sensitivity\nof the various hard processes to $\\alpha_s$ and the consistency of $\\alpha_s$\ndetermination in global analysis.\n", "  In order to observe a signal of possible CP violation in top-quark couplings,\nwe have studied energy correlation of the final leptons in $e^+e^-\\to t\\bar{t}\n\\to \\ell^+\\ell^-X / \\ell^\\pm X$ at future linear colliders. Applying the\nrecently-proposed optimal method, we have compared the statistical\nsignificances of CP-violation-parameter determination using double- and\nsingle-lepton distributions. We have found that the single-lepton-distribution\nanalysis is more advantageous.\n", "  We study CP violation in $B\\to K^* \\ell^+\\ell^-$ using generalized Dalitz\nplot asymmetries in the angular distribution. These new kind of asymmetries are\nconstructed by adding B and ${\\bar B}$ events, and do not require flavor or\ntime tagging, nor is the presence of strong phases needed. Using this method\none requires about $2 \\times 10^8/\\eta$ B's to measure the CP violating\nparameter $\\eta$ in the Standard model. The two--Higgs doublet model requires\nonly $10^7$ B's to constrain parameters better than done by the electric dipole\nmoment of the neutron.\n", "  The contributions of $s-$channel Higgs in $l^+ l^- \\rightarrow q \\bar{q}$\nprocesses in the general lepton collider ($l^+ l^-$ collider) within Standard\nModel is studied. A new idea to extract the contribution by using the data from\nboth electron and future heavy-lepton colliders at same center-of-mass energy\nis proposed. Deviations due to the $s-$channel Higgs contributions are analysed\nand discussed for the heavy-quark final states by using the total\ncross-section, forward-backward asymmetry and its ratio. It is shown that\nsignificant deviations are expected for the top quark final state.\n", "  We discuss an application of QCD sum rules to the heavy baryons $\\Lambda_Q$\nand $\\Sigma_Q$. The predictions for the masses of heavy baryons, residues and\nIsgur-Wise function are presented.\n  The new results on two loop anomalous dimensions of baryonic currents and QCD\nradiative corrections (two- and three- loop contributions) to the first two\nWilson coefficients in OPE are explicitly presented.\n", "  We show that the CP-violating dipole form factors of the tau lepton can be of\nthe order of $\\alpha/\\pi$ in units of the length scale set by the inverse $Z$\nboson mass. We propose a few observables which are sensitive to these form\nfactors at LEP2 and higher e^+e^- collision energies.\n", "  We calculate the decay width for the process $H^+ \\to h^0 W^+$ up to order\n$g^4$ in the framework of the Two Higgs Doublet Model. We argue that for some\nreasonable choice of the free parameters the contribution from the one-loop\ngraphs can be as large as 40%.\n", "  Effective-field-theory methods are used to study the high T limit of QCD.\nThese methods unravel the contributions to the free energy of QCD at high\ntemperature from the scales T, gT, and g^2 T. The free energy is explicitly\ncomputed to order g^5. Implications for the application of perturbative QCD to\nthe quark-gluon plasma are also discussed.\n", "  Static polarizabilities of the low--lying $1/2^+$ baryons are studied within\nthe collective coordinate approach to the three flavor generalization of the\nSkyrme model; in particular, magnetic polarizabilities are considered.\nPredicted polarizabilities, which result from different treatments of the\nstrange degrees of freedom in this model, are critically compared. Their\ndeviations from the flavor symmetric formulations are discussed.\n", "  We investigate two cosmological axion problems (isocurvature fluctuations and\ndomain-wall formation) in chaotic inflationary universe. It is believed that\nthese problems are solved if potential for the Peccei-Quinn scalar field is\nvery flat. However, we find that too many domain walls are produced through\nparametric resonance decay of the Peccei-Quinn scalar field. Only the axion\nmodel with N=1(N: QCD anomaly factor) is consistent with observations. We also\npoint out that the flat potential is naturally obtained in a supersymmetric\nextension of the Peccei-Quinn model. If Peccei-Quinn breaking scale $F_a$ is\nabout 10^{12} GeV, this model predicts anisotropies of cosmic microwave\nbackground radiation due to the axion isocurvature fluctuations which may be\ndetectable in future observations.\n", "  The two particle inclusive cross section for the reaction\n$p\\bar{p}\\rightarrow \\gamma+c+X$ is studied in perturbative quantum\nchromodynamics at order $O(\\alpha_s^2)$. Differential distributions are\nprovided for various observables, and a comparison is made with preliminary\ndata from the CDF collaboration.\n", "  We analyse the quark mass hierarchy and CKM matrix using the universal Yukawa\ncoupling model with small violations precisely. We estimate the ranges of the\nvalues of 8 violation parameters (delta1u, delta2u, delta3u, delta1d, delta2d,\ndelta3d, phi2, phi3) in our quark mass matrices satisfying quark mass ratios\nand CKM matrix, where phi2, phi3 are phases. Without these phases, the solution\n  satisfying quark mass ratios and CKM matrix is not obtained. These parameters\nobtained can explain the CP violation effects.\n", "  Phenomenological CP-violating parameters in decays of neutral B-mesons are\ndiscussed. Special attention is given to the degree of their measurability. We\nemphasize important role of the sign of $\\Delta m_B$ and suggest how it could\nbe determined experimentally.\n", "  By a completely independent analytic calculation made in general covariant\ngauge we confirm the known result for the massless $\\alpha_s^3$ correction to\n$R_{had}$ and check explicitly its gauge independence. We extend the\ncalculations to include contributions due to a hypothetical existence of a\ncolour octet of (light) neutral fermions known also under the name of gluinos.\n", "  A program including all radiative corrections to the MSSM at the same level\nas the radiative corrections to the SM has been developed and used to perform\nglobal fits to all electroweak data from LEP, SLC and the Tevatron and the\nradiative b->sgamma decay from CLEO. Values of the strong coupling constant at\nthe $M_Z$ scale and $\\sin^2\\theta_{\\overline{MS}}$ are derived, both in the SM\nand MSSM. Recent updates on electroweak data, which have been presented at the\nWarsaw Conference in summer 1996, reduce the R_b anomaly from a 3.2 sigma to a\n1.8 sigma effect. In addition, the $b \\to s\\gamma$ decay is 30% below the SM\nprediction. In the MSSM light stops and light charginos increase $R_b$ and\ndecrease the $b \\to s\\gamma$ rate, so both observations can be brought into\nagreement with the MSSM for the same region of parameter space. However, the\nresulting $\\chi^2$ value for the MSSM fits is only marginally lower and in\naddition, the splitting in the stop sector has to be unnaturally high.\n", "  We discuss the calculation of the width difference $\\Delta\\Gamma_{B_s}$\nbetween the $B_s$ mass eigenstates to next-to-leading order in the heavy quark\nexpansion. $1/m_b$-corrections are estimated to reduce the leading order result\nby typically $30\\%$. The error of the present estimate\n$(\\Delta\\Gamma/\\Gamma)_{B_s} = 0.16^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$ could be substantially\nimproved by pinning down the value of $\\langle \\bar{B}_s |(\\bar\nb_is_i)_{S-P}(\\bar b_js_j)_{S-P}| B_s\\rangle$ and an accuracy of $10\\%$ in\n$(\\Delta\\Gamma/\\Gamma)_{B_s}$ should eventually be reached. We briefly mention\nstrategies to measure $(\\Delta\\Gamma/\\Gamma)_{B_s}$, and its implications for\nconstraints on $\\Delta M_{B_s}$, CKM parameters and the observation of CP\nviolation in untagged $B_s$ samples.\n", "  The NA35 experiment used several independent methods to determine the strange\nparticle production in p+S and S+A collisions. The different techniques show\nconsistent results. Strangeness conservation in full phase space is used as an\nadditional check of the consistency of the data.\n  On the base of the analysis in full phase space it could be shown that\nstrangeness conservation is fullfilled. The NA35 K$^0_S$ in S+S and S+Ag are\nconsistent with the NA44 results for K$^+$ and K$^-$. The results of the NA36\ncollaboration for S+Pb collisions were extrapolated to full phase space. The\ncomparison with the NA35 results shows more than two times lower yields. The\nratio of $\\Lambda$ to $\\overline{\\Lambda}$ at midrapidity of NA36 is\ninconsistent with the high baryon density determind by NA35. The strange\nparticle production is compared to the abundance of non strange particles,\nespecially negatively charged pions which are measured in full phase space in\nthe same experiment. A clear enhanced strange hadron production relative to\n$\\pi^-$ is observed in S+Ag collisions compared to p+S reactions at the same\nenergy. The K$^0_S$ multiplicity in full phase space per negative hadron\n(h$^-$) in S+S, S+Ag and Pb+Pb is enhanced by about a factor 1.6 compared to\nN+N and p+S collisions. The NA36 result for the K$^0_S$ multiplicity per h$^-$\nin S+Pb is below the N+N value.\n", "  A fluid of Skyrmions coupled to the dilaton field and the $\\o$ meson field is\nconsidered. A mean field theory is developed in which the dilaton and the $\\o$\nfield acquire a mean value determined by the Skyrmions. The influence of the\nbackground fields on the Skyrmion profile is determined and consequently the\nscaling properties of the Skyrmion follow. The model obeys chiral invariance\nand scale invariance broken only by the dilaton trace anomaly potential. The\ndilaton plays the role of the scalar field as in the $\\s + \\o$ model. The\ndilaton potential is augmented by terms that do not spoil the trace anomaly\nwhile allowing a fit to nuclear matter properties. The phase diagram of the\nmodel shows unique features, like a lack of solutions for certain densities and\ntemperatures, signalling the appearance of a new phase that can not be\ndescribed in terms of Skyrme baryons.\n", "  I present a more refined analysis of the mass-splittings between the\ndifferent heavy quarkonia states, using {\\it new double ratios} of exponential\nmoments of different two-point functions. Then, I test the validity of the\n$1/m$-expansion, extract $\\alpha_s(M_Z)=0.127\\pm 0.011$ from $M_{\\chi_c(P^1_1)}\n- M_{\\chi_c(P^3_1)}$, and provide a new estimate of the gluon condensate from\n$M_\\psi -M_{\\eta_c}$ and $M_{\\chi_b}-M_\\Upsilon$, which combined with the\nrecent estimate from the $\\tau$-like decay sum rules in $e^+e^-\\rar I=1$\nhadrons data, leads to the {\\it update average value} $\\la\\alpha_s G^2\\ra =\n(7.1\\pm 0.9)\\times 10^{-2}$ GeV$^4$ from the light and heavy quark systems. I\nalso find $M_{\\Upsilon}-M_{\\eta_b}\\approx 63^{-29}_{+51}$ MeV implying the\npossible observation of the $\\eta_b$ in the $\\Upsilon$-radiative decay.\n", "  We use the assumption of electric-magnetic duality to express the heavy quark\npotential in QCD in terms of a Wilson Loop $W_{eff}(\\Gamma)$ determined by the\ndynamics of a dual theory which is weakly coupled at long distances. The\nclassical approximation gives the leading contribution to $W_{eff}(\\Gamma)$ and\nyields a velocity dependent heavy quark potential which for large $R$ becomes\nlinear in $R$, and which for small $R$ approaches lowest order perturbative\nQCD. The corresponding long distance interaction between color magnetic\nmonopoles is governed by a Yukawa potential. As a consequence the magnetic\ninteraction between the color magnetic moments of the quarks is exponentially\ndamped. The semi-classical corrections to $W_{eff}(\\Gamma)$ due to fluctuations\nof the classical flux tube should lead to an effective string theory free from\nthe conformal anomaly.\n", "  In this paper we study the matrix element of the transverse component of the\nbilocal vector current in the context of deep inelastic scattering. BJL limit\nof high energy amplitudes together with light-front current algebra imply the\nsame parton interpretation for its matrix element as that of the plus\ncomponent. On the other hand, the transverse component depends explicitly on\nthe gluon field operator in QCD, appears as \"twist three\" and hence its matrix\nelement has no manifest parton interpretation. In this paper we perform\ncalculations in light-front time-ordering perturbative QCD for a dressed quark\ntarget to order $\\alpha_s$ and demonstrate that the matrix element of the\ntransverse component of the bilocal vector current has the same parton\ninterpretation as that of the plus component.\n", "  Two-point functions related to the pion weak decay constant $f_\\pi$ are\ncalculated from the generating functional of chiral perturbation theory in the\nmean field approximation and the heavy-baryon limit. The aim is to demonstrate\nthat Lorentz invariance is violated in the presence of background matter. This\nfact manifests itself in the splitting of both $f_\\pi$ and the pion mass into\nuncorrelated time- and space-like parts. We emphasize the different in-medium\nrenormalizations of the correlation functions, show the inequivalence between\nthe in-medium values of $f_\\pi$ deduced from Walecka-type models, on the one\nhand, and QCD sum rules, on the other hand, and elaborate on the importance for\nsome nuclear physics observables.\n", "  We review several aspects of K-Physics:\n  i) Main targets of the field,\n  ii) The theoretical framework for K-decays,\n  iii) Standard analysis of the unitarity triangle,\n  iv) epsilon'/epsilon,\n  v) Rare and CP violating K-decays,\n  vi) Comparision of the potentials of K --> pi nu nu-bar and CP-B asymmetries.\n  vii) Some aspects of the physics beyond the Standard Model.\n", "  We discuss the stability of multiquark systems within the recent model of\nGlozman et al. where the chromomagnetic hyperfine interaction is replaced by\npseudoscalar-meson exchange contributions. We find that such an interaction\nbinds a heavy tetraquark systems $QQ\\bar q\\bar q$ ($Q=c,b and q=u,d)$ by\n0.2-0.4 GeV. This is at variance with results of previous models where $cc\\bar\nq\\bar q$ is unstable.\n", "  We consider CP violating asymmetries that are induced by\nparticle-antiparticle mixing in inclusive channels of neutral $B$ meson decay.\nNot only are the branching ratios sizable, at the 1% to 50% level, but some of\nthose asymmetries are expected to be large because of substantial CKM phases.\nThe inclusive sum partially dilutes the asymmetries, but the dilution factor is\ncalculable, assuming local quark-hadron duality, and CKM parameters can be\nreliably extracted. We discuss in detail the determination of $sin 2\\alpha$\nfrom charmless final states in decays of $B_d$ mesons and survey the\nasymmetries for other inclusive final states. While probably not yet sensitive\nto standard model predictions, meaningful CP violation studies can be conducted\nwith existing data samples of inclusive neutral $B$ decays.\n", "  From the $0^{++}$ glueball candidate we argue that the $1^{--}$ glueball $O$\nto be near in mass to $J/\\psi$. This is supported by the recent null search for\n$\\psi^\\prime \\to \\rho\\pi, K^*\\bar K$, while absence of distortion in the energy\nscan of $J/\\psi \\to \\rho\\pi$ indicates that $\\Gamma_O \\gg \\Gamma_{J/\\psi}$. $O$\nmay also play a role in the OZI violating $\\bar p p \\to \\phi\\gamma, \\phi\\pi$\nproduction puzzle.\n", "  In these lectures we present a brief review of the Higgs boson sector in the\n``Standard Model'', and its Minimal Supersymmetric Extension, with particular\nemphasis on the main mechanisms for Higgs production and decay at LEP2 and LHC,\nand theoretical bounds on the Higgs boson masses. In the ``Standard Model'' the\neffective potential can develop a non-standard minimum for values of the field\nmuch larger than the weak scale. Comparison of the decay rate to the\nnon-standard minimum at finite (and zero) temperature with the corresponding\nexpansion rate of the Universe allows to identify the region, in the ($M_H$,\n$M_t$)-plane which can be accomodated by the theory. In the ``Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model'', approximate analytical expressions for the\nHiggs mass spectrum and couplings are worked out. An appropriate treatment of\nsquark decoupling allows to consider large values of the stop mixing parameters\nand thus fix a reliable upper bound on the mass of the lightest CP-even Higgs\nboson mass. The discovery of the Higgs boson at LEP2 might put an upper bound\n(below the Planck scale) on the scale of new physics $\\Lambda$ and eventually\ndisentangle between the Standard Model and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard\nModel.\n", "  We investigate the effects induced by excited leptons, at the one-loop level,\nin the anomalous magnetic and weak-magnetic form factors of the leptons. Using\na general effective Lagrangian approach to describe the couplings of the\nexcited leptons, we compute their contributions to the weak-magnetic moment of\nthe $\\tau$ lepton, which can be measured on the $Z$ peak, and we compare it\nwith the contributions to $g_\\mu - 2$, measured at low energies.\n", "  We describe several numerical results for radiative corrections for deep\ninelastic $ep$ scattering at HERA which are calculated using the HECTOR\npackage. We present radiative corrections for ten different choices of\nkinematical variables for unpolarized neutral and charged current deep\ninelastic scattering. Radiative corrections for neutral current scattering off\npolarized protons are calculated in leptonic variables and compared to those\nobtained by the POLRAD code for the kinematic regime of the HERMES experiment.\n", "  We present an overview of the loop corrections to the mass difference $\\Delta\nm_{B_d^0}/ m_{B_d^0}$ within the minimal supersymmetric standard model. We\ninclude the complete mixing matrices of the charginos and neutralinos as well\nas of the scalar partners of the left and right handed third generation quarks.\nWe show that the SUSY contribution to the mass difference in the $B_d^0$ system\nis comparable to the Standard Model one and can be even larger for the charged\nHiggs contribution and for a certain supersymmetric parameter space.\n", "  We calculate the cross sections for the production of Higgs particles in\nassociation with a photon in $e^+ e^-$ collisions, $e^+ e^- \\to \\gamma+$Higgs,\nallowing for the longitudinal polarization of the initial electron and positron\nbeams. We consider the associated production of both the Standard Model Higgs\nboson, and the neutral CP-even and CP-odd Higgs particles of its minimal\nsupersymmetric extension. Complete and compact analytical expressions are\ngiven, and the size of the cross sections is illustrated for energies which\nwill be reached at future $e^+ e^-$ colliders.\n", "  Using electroweak data and an effective Lagrangian approach we obtain\nstringent bounds on the tau anomalous magnetic moment, $-0.004 \\leq a_\\tau \\leq\n0.006$, and on its electric dipole moment, $|d_\\tau| \\leq 1.1 \\times 10^{-17}\ne$ cm. This significantly improves our previous bounds. With the same method,\nwe obtain limits on the dipole moments of other fermions.\n", "  If an adiabatic density perturbation is responsible for large scale structure\nand the cmb anisotropy, its spectral index $n$ will be measured in the\nforseeable future with an accuracy $\\Delta n\\sim .01$. This is precisely the\nkind of accuracy required to distinguish between many models of inflation. Most\nof them have an inflationary potential $V\\simeq V_0(1\\pm\\mu\\phi^p)$ with the\nconstant term dominating. Except for $0\\lsim p\\lsim 2$, the prediction is\n$n=1\\pm (2/N)(p-1)/(p-2)$, where $N$ is the number of $e$-folds of inflation\nafter cosmological scales leave the horizon. It typically lies in the range\n$0.9\\lsim n\\lsim 1.1$. For $p=2$ one has $n=1\\pm 2\\Mpl^2 \\mu$ where $\\Mpl=(8\\pi\nG)^{-1/2}$. A generic supergravity theory gives contributions of order $\\pm\nH^2$ to the inflaton mass-squared $m^2$ whereas inflation requires $|m^2| <<\nH^2$. Proposals for keeping $m^2$ small are surveyed with emphasis on their\nimplications for $n$. Finally, the case of a multi-component inflaton (as in\n`double' inflation) is discussed. In all cases, the best method of calculating\nthe spectrum of the adiabatic density perturbation starts with the assumption\nthat, after smoothing on a super-horizon scale, the evolution of the universe\nalong each comoving worldline will be practically the same as in an unperturbed\nuniverse with the same initial inflaton field. The possible isocurvature\ndensity perturbation is briefly discussed, with a simple derivation of the fact\nthat the low multipoles of the cmb anisotropy are six times as big as for an\nadiabatic density perturbation.\n", "  Instanton calculations in QCD are generically plagued by infrared\ndivergencies associated with the integration over the instanton size $\\rho$.\nHere, we demonstrate explicitly that the typical inverse hard momentum scale\n${\\mathcal Q}^{-1}$ in deep-inelastic scattering provides a dynamical infrared\ncutoff for the size parameter $\\rho$. Hence, deep-inelastic scattering may be\nviewed as a distinguished process for studying manifestations of\nQCD-instantons. For clarity, we restrict the explicit discussion to the\nsimplest chirality-violating process, $\\gamma^{\\ast}+{\\rm g}\\rightarrow\n\\overline{{\\rm q}_{L}}+{\\rm q}_{R}$. We calculate the corresponding fixed angle\ncross-section as well as the contributions to the gluon structure functions,\n${\\mathcal F}_{2g}$ and ${\\mathcal F}_{Lg}$, within standard instanton\nperturbation theory in leading semi-classical approximation. To this\napproximation, fixed-angle scattering processes at high $Q^2$ are reliably\ncalculable. In the Bjorken limit, the considered instanton-induced process\ngives a scaling contribution to ${\\mathcal F}_{2g}(x,Q^{2})$ and the\nCallan-Gross relation holds.\n", "  Measurements of $\\psi$ and $\\psi'$ production from experiment NA50 at the\nCERN SPS are compared to predictions based on a hadronic model of charmonium\nsuppression by Vogt and myself. Data on centrality dependence and total cross\nsections are in good accord with our predictions. Uncertainties in theoretical\nquanities such as NA50's $L$ parameter are discussed.\n", "  The purposes and possibilities of future diffractive structure function\nmeasurements at HERA are presented. A review of the current range and accuracy\nof the measurement of $F_2^{D(3)}(\\beta, x_p, Q^2)$ is presented and an\nestimate of the precision of future measurements is given. A feasibility study\nis performed on the measurement of the structure functions $F_2^{D(4)}(\\beta,\nx_p, Q^2, t)$, $F_{2 charm}^{D}$, $R^{D(3)}$, $R^{D(4)}$ and $F_L^{p}$.\nIncluded in this study are estimates of the integrated luminosity required, the\nanalysis techniques to be employed and values of systematic error that could be\nexpected.\n", "  The results are presented of a study of the accuracy one may achieve at HERA\nin measuring the strong coupling constant $\\alpha_s$ and the gluon distribution\n$xg(x,Q^{2})$ using future data of the structure function $F_{2}(x,Q^{2})$\nwhich are estimated to be accurate at the few % level over the full accessible\nkinematic region down to $x \\simeq 10^{-5}$ and up to $Q^{2} \\simeq 50000\nGeV^{2}$. The analysis includes simulated proton and deuteron data, and the\neffect of combining HERA data with fixed target data is discussed.\n", "  We examine certain extensions of the standard model in which $CP$ violation\nis spontaneous and the strong $CP$ problem is resolved. In these models, the $3\n\\times 3$ quark mixing matrix is neither real nor unitary. However, to a\nprecision of 0.1%, it is real and orthogonal. There are no readily observable\n$CP$-violating effects besides those in the neutral kaon system.\n", "  Hadronic matrix elements of the vector, axial-vector and tensor currents\nrelevant for exclusive rare decays $B\\to(\\pi,\\rho,K,K^*)\\,l^+l^-$ induced by\nthe quark transition $b\\to d,s$ are analysed using dispersion formulation of\nthe light-cone constituent quark model. The form factors in the decay region\nare expressed as relativistic double spectral representations through the\nlight-cone wave functions of the initial and final mesons. These form factors\nare shown to have the correct scaling properties in the limit of heavy-to-heavy\nand heavy-to-light quark transitions in accordance with QCD. The dependence on\nthe quark-model parameters is studied.\n", "  We study the chiral phase transition at $T\\neq 0$ in the dual Ginzburg-Landau\ntheory using the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equation. In order to solve the SD\nequation at $T\\neq 0$, we provide a new ansatz for the quark self-energy in the\nimaginary-time formalism. The recovery of the chiral symmetry is found at\n$T_{_{C}}\\sim 100 MeV$ with realistic parameters, which are set by reproducing\nthe values of the string tension $\\sqrt{\\sigma}\\simeq 0.44 GeV$ and the chiral\ncondensate $< {\\bar q}q > \\simeq -(250 MeV}^{3}$ at $T=0$.\n", "  We review some selected topics in the decays of heavy flavours, beauty and\ncharm, which are of principal interest at HERA-B and HERA. The topics in $B$\nphysics include: an update on the quark mixing matrix and CP violating phases,\nissues bearing on an improved resolution on the CP-violating phase $\\Delta (sin\n2 \\beta)$, prospects of measuring radiative and semileptonic rare $B$ decays,\nthe $B_s^{0}$ - $\\overline{B_s^{0}}$ mixing ratio $x_s$, improved measurements\nof the $B_d^{0}$ - $\\overline{B_d^{0}}$ mixing ratio $x_d$ and the $B$-hadron\nlifetimes, in particular $\\tau(\\Lambda_b)$. In the charm sector, we have\nfocussed on rare decays and $D^0$- $\\overline{D^0}$ mixing, whose measurements\nwill signal physics beyond the standard model.\n", "  The standard CKM model can be tested and New Physics detected using only\nCP-violating phase measurements in B decays. This requires the measurement of a\nphase factor which is small in the Standard Model, in addition to the usual\nlarge phases $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$. We also point out that identifying\nviolations of the unitarity of the CKM matrix is rather difficult, and cannot\nbe done with phase measurements alone.\n", "  We review the present theoretical knowledge of the charm--strange\ncontribution to charged--current DIS structure functions. In particular, the\nuncertainties arising from the choice of the factorization scale, of the\nmassive QCD scheme, and of the parton fit are discussed.\n", "  The double ratio $(f_{B_s}/f_{B_d})/(f_{D_s}/f_{D_d})$ is calculated by QCD\nsum rules in heavy quark effective theory (HQET), both numerically and\nanalytically. Our expression for the double ratio shows explicitly the\ndependence on the light quark masses, the heavy quark symmetry breaking and the\nvacuum condensates. The numerical result favors the double ratio to be a little\ngreater than 1.\n", "  Lecture Notes, Summer School on Effective Theories and Fundamental\nInteractions, Erice, July 1996. I describe the construction of effective field\ntheories for equilibrium high-temperature plasma of elementary particles.\n", "  The investigation of symmetry nonrestoration scenarios has led to a\ncontroversy, with certain nonperturbative approximation schemes giving\nindications in sharp disagreement with those found within conventional\nperturbation theory. A Rayleigh-Ritz variational approach to the problem, which\nmight be useful in bridging the gap between perturbative and nonperturbative\nviewpoints, is here proposed. As a first application, this approach is used in\nthe investigation of a $Z_2 \\times Z_2$-invariant thermal field theory with two\nscalar fields, placing particular emphasis on the region of parameter space\nthat has been claimed to support symmetry nonrestoration.\n", "  We report that the hypothesis that the upper bound on the axion decay\nconstant can be moved up beyond $10^{12}$ GeV in models with a stronger QCD in\nthe early universe is not realized. This proof is possible by studying the\nsuperpotential in the dual model and obtaining the form of the axion potential\nrespecting the original global symmetries.\n", "  Within Chiral Perturbation Theory (CHPT) we compute the form factors A, V and\n$\\gamma = A/V$ in the $\\pi \\to \\nu l \\gamma$ decay to $O(p^6)$. A and $\\gamma$\nobtain corrections of order 25%.\n", "  The new measurements of $B\\to J/\\psi K(K^*)$ decays by CDF and CLEO indicate\nthat the production ratio $R$ and the fraction of longitudinal polarization\n$\\Gamma_L/\\Gamma$ are smaller than the previous results. In conjunction with\nthe new result of parity-odd transverse polarization in $B\\to J/\\psi K^*$, we\nfound a minimal modification to the factorization hypothesis: While the data of\n$B\\to J/\\psi K^*$ can be accommodated in the factorization approach with\nnonfactorizable terms $\\chi_{A_1} = \\chi_{A_2} = \\chi_{V} \\equiv \\chi$ of order\n15%, the result of $R$ measurement requires that the nonfactorizable effect\n$\\chi_{F_1}$ on $B\\to J/\\psi K$ be slightly larger than $\\chi$. Therefore, the\neffective parameter $a_2^{\\rm eff}$ is not universal even for $B\\to J/\\psi\nK(K^*)$ decays. We have generalized the considerations to $B\\to \\psi(2S)K(K^*)$\nand $B_s\\to J/\\psi\\phi$ and found that the predictions are in agreement with\ncurrently available data.\n", "  The prospects for a determination of the strong coupling constant $\\alpha_s$\nvia scaling violations of fragmentation functions in deeply inelastic\nscattering are studied. The statistical error in the case of an integrated\nluminosity of $250 pb^{-1}$, and the theoretical errors due to the various\nparton density parametrizations and to the factorization scale dependence are\nestimated.\n", "  We compute the branching fraction of the decays $B \\to K \\nu \\bar\\nu$ and $B\n\\to K^* \\nu \\bar\\nu$ in the Standard Model. We also comment on the experimental\ndifficulties and procedures to detect such modes at B factories.\n", "  Possible $CP$-violation in top-quark couplings is discussed. It is shown that\nthe lepton-energy distributions in $e^+ e^- \\to t\\bar{t} \\to \\ell^+\\ell^-X /\n\\ell^\\pm X$ at next linear colliders (NLC) could give us useful information for\nthis study. The statistical significance of $CP$-violating-parameter\ndetermination is estimated.\n", "  We discuss the tests of general Three Gauge Boson Vertices (TGV) through\nbosonic pair production at present and future hadron colliders. All bosonic\nfinal states are reviewed via the tree level quark-antiquark annihilation\nsub-process. The full analytic expressions of the helicity amplitudes and\ncross-sections are given. These expressions should be useful in any attempt to\ndisentangle the effects of the most general non standard $WWV (V=\\gamma,Z)$\nvertices including 14 free parameters. We investigate the sensitivity of the\ninvariant mass and transverse momentum distributions to the full set of\nanomalous couplings including final state polarization structures. We\nparticularly consider these features at the projected CERN Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) energy scale.\n", "  By extending the standard gauge group to $SU(3)_c \\times SU(2)_L \\times\nU(1)_Y \\times U(1)_X$ with $X$ charges carried only by the third family we\naccommodate the LEP measurement of $R_b$ and predict a potentially measurable\ndiscrepancy in $A_{FB}^{b}$ in $e^+e^-$ scattering and that $D^0 \\bar D^0$\nmixing may be near its experimental limit. The uniqueness of our model is that\nthe Z' couplings are generation-dependent and hence explicitly violate the GIM\nmechanism, but can nevertheless be naturally consistent with FCNC constraints.\nDirect detection of this Z' is possible but challenging.\n", "  The time evolution of O(N) symmetric lambda Phi^4 scalar field theory is\nstudied in the large N limit. In this limit the <Phi> mean field and two-point\ncorrelation function <Phi Phi> evolve together as a self-consistent closed\nHamiltonian system, characterized by a Gaussian density matrix. The static part\nof the effective Hamiltonian defines the True Effective Potential U_eff for\nconfigurations far from thermal equilibrium. Numerically solving the time\nevolution equations for energy densities corresponding to a quench in the\nunstable spinodal region, we find results quite different from what might be\ninferred from the equilibrium free energy ``effective'' potential F. Typical\ntime evolutions show effectively irreversible energy flow from the coherent\nmean fields to the quantum fluctuating modes, due to the creation of massless\nGoldstone bosons near threshold. The plasma frequency and collisionless damping\nrate of the mean fields are calculated in terms of the particle number density\nby a linear response analysis and compared with the numerical results.\nDephasing of the fluctuations leads also to the growth of an effective entropy\nand the transition from quantum to classical behavior of the ensemble. In\naddition to casting some light on fundamental issues of nonequilibrium quantum\nstatistical mechanics, the general framework presented in this work may be\napplied to a study of the dynamics of second order phase transitions in a wide\nvariety of Landau-Ginsburg systems described by a scalar order parameter.\n", "  We calculate structure functions at small $x$ both under the assumption of a\nhard singularity (a power behaviour $x^{-\\lambda}, \\lambda$ positive, for\n$x\\rightarrow 0$) or that of a soft-Pomeron dominated behaviour, also called\ndouble scaling limit, for the singlet component. A full next to leading order\n(NLO) analysis is carried for the functions $F_2, F_{\\rm Glue}$ and the\nlongitudinal one $F_L$ in $ep$ scattering, and for $x F_3$ in neutrino\nscattering. The results of the calculations are compared with data (HERA) in\nthe range $x\\leq 0.032, 10 gev^2\\leq Q^2\\leq 1 500 gev^2$. We get reasonable\nfits, with a chi-squared/d.o.f.$\\sim 2$, for both assumptions, but none of them\ngives a fully satisfactory description. The results improve substantially if\ncombining a soft and a hard component; in this case it is even possible to\nextend the analysis, phenomenologically, to small values of $Q^2$, $0.31\ngev^2\\leq Q^2\\leq 8.5 gev^2$, and in the $x$ range $6\\times10^{-6}\\lsim x \\lsim\n0.04$, with the same hard plus soft Pomeron hypothesis by assuming a saturating\nexpression for the strong coupling,\n$\\tilde{\\alpha}_s(Q^2)=4\\pi/\\beta_0\\log[(Q^2+\\Lambda_{eff}^2)/\\Lambda_{eff}^2]$\nThe description for low $Q^2$ implies self-consistent values for the parameters\nin the exponents of $x$. One gets, for the Regge intercepts,\n$\\alpha_{\\rho}(0)=0.48$ and $\\alpha_P(0)=1.470$ [$\\lambda=0.470$], in uncanny\nagreement with other determinations of these parameters, in particular the\nresults of the large $Q^2$ fits. The fit to is so good that we may look (at\nlarge $Q^2$) for signals of a \"triple Pomeron\" vertex; some evidence is found.\n", "  We consider a general formalism, previously developed to describe single spin\nasymmetries (SSA) in inclusive particle production at moderately large $p_T$ in\nhadron-hadron high-energy processes. In this approach SSA can originate from\nnon perturbative, universal, quark distribution analyzing powers, provided the\nquark intrinsic motion is taken into account. A fit of the available data on\n$p^\\uparrow p \\to \\pi X$ fixes simplified phenomenological expressions of these\nquark analyzing powers for the dominant (at large $x_F$) $u$ and $d$ quark\ncontributions. We use the results of the fit as input to provide a possible\nscenario for SSA in a number of interesting processes (e.g. $p p \\to \\gamma X$,\n$p p \\to K X$) for which experimental results are or will soon be available.\n", "  These lectures provide an introduction to lattice methods for nonperturbative\nstudies of Quantum Chromodynamics.\n  Lecture 1 (Ch. 2): Basic techniques for QCD and results for hadron\nspectroscopy using the simplest discretizations;\n  lecture 2 (Ch. 3): ``improved actions''--what they are and how well they work\n  lecture 3 (Ch. 4): SLAC physics from the lattice: structure functions, the\nmass of the glueball, heavy quarks and $\\alpha_s(M_Z)$, and $B-\\bar B$ mixing.\n", "  On the basis of present solar neutrino observations and relaxing the\nconstraints from solar models it is possible that most (or nearly all) of the\nflux of electron neutrinos detected comes from electron capture in $^7{Be}$.\nThese solutions arise from neutrino oscillations in which $\\nu_e$ $-$\n$\\nu_\\tau$ mixing suppresses high energy $\\nu_e$ and $\\nu_e - \\nu_\\mu$ mixing\nsuppresses low energy $\\nu_e$ as qualitatively suggested from some SO(10) grand\nunified models. The importance of future observations is emphasized.\n", "  We perform a Monte-Carlo simulation of scalar leptoquark pair production at\nthe Tevatron (energy =1.8 TeV and luminosity =100 pb^{-1}) with ISAJET. We also\ninvestigate the dominant sources of Standard Model background: Z*jj, ZZ\nproduction and heavy quark top-antitop. We find that the top-antitop background\nis the most important except near the Z pole where the Z*jj background is\npeaked. We also evaluate the signal-to-background ratio and find a discovery\nreach of 130 GeV (170 GeV) for a branching ratio of B(LQ-> eq)=0.5 (B=1).\n", "  The scalar and vector leptoquark pair production cross sections in hadronic\ncollisions are calculated. In a model independent analysis we consider the most\ngeneral C and P conserving couplings of gluons to both scalar and vector\nleptoquarks described by an effective low--energy Lagangian which obeys SU(3)_c\ninvariance. Analytrical expressions are derived for the differential and\nintegral scattering cross sections including the case of anomalous vector\nleptoquark couplings, $\\kappa_G$ and $\\lambda_G$, to the gluon field. Numerical\npredictions are given for the kinematic range of the TEVATRON and LHC. The pair\nproduction cross sections are also calculated for the resolved photon\ncontributions to $ep \\rightarrow e \\overline{\\Phi} \\Phi X$ at HERA and LEP\n$\\otimes$ LHC, and for the process $\\gamma \\gamma \\rightarrow \\Phi \\overline\n{\\Phi}X$ at possible future $e^+e^-$ linear colliders and $\\gamma \\gamma$\ncolliders. Estimates of the search potential for scalar and vector leptoquarks\nat present and future high energy colliders are given.\n", "  The vector glueball $O$, made of 3 valence gluons, is expected to be\n``clean\": it mixes less with quarkonia, but mediates OZI violations.

Lower and upper bounds on $\\Gamma_O$ can be argued from $e^+e^- \\to\n\\rho\\pi$ energy scan data and the condition $B(O\\to \\rho\\pi) > B(J/\\psi\\to\n\\rho\\pi)$. $O$ dominance may explain the ``large\" OZI violation in $^1S_0(\\bar\npp)\\to \\phi\\gamma$ vs. $\\omega\\gamma$.\n", "  We calculate the single-spin and double-spin asymmetry differential cross\nsections for the polarized hadron scattering $PP \\to l^+ l^- + jet$ up to\n$O(\\alpha_s)$ by the helicity amplitude method. Numerical results of the\ndifferential cross sections, which can be used to probe the spin contents of\nthe proton, are obtained with several sets of polarized parton distribution\nfunctions.\n", "  The radiative decay $\\nu_H \\to \\nu_L + \\gamma$ of massive neutrinos is\nanalyzed in the framework of the standard model with lepton mixing for very\nstrong magnetic fields $B\\gg B_{cr} = m_e^2/e \\sim 4.14 \\times 10^{13}$G. The\nanalysis is based on the approximate decay amplitude obtained by Gvozdev et al.\nNumerical results as well as analytical approximations for the decay rate are\nobtained for energies of the initial neutrino below and {\\em above} the\nelectron-positron pair creation threshold $2m_e$.\n", "  Weak decays and mixing of B-hadrons play a special role in our understanding\nof the physics of the Standard Model and beyond. The measured amplitudes,\nhowever, result from a complicated interplay of weak and strong interaction\neffects. Understanding strong interaction dynamics, which becomes simpler for\nheavy quarks, is thus a fundamental part of the game. In this review, several\ntheoretical aspects of B dynamics which are relevant for current and future\nexperimental measurements are discussed.\n", "  We review the main features of the leptophobic-Z' phenomenology, commenting\non the prospects of these models after the recent experimental results on R_c,\nR_b and after the recent theoretical analyses of jet production at the\nTevatron.\n", "  The radiative decays of the $(3/2)^+$ baryons are studied in the three flavor\ngeneralization of the Skyrme model. The kaon fields are treated in the slow\nrotator approach which properly accounts for the observed deviations from the\n$U$-spin relations for the hyperon magnetic moments. This makes possible a\ncritical discussion of the $U$-spin selection rules for the radiative hyperon\ndecays. The variation of the decay widths with strangeness is studied and a\ncomparison with other treatments of the $SU(3)$ Skyrme model is performed in\norder to analyze the effects of flavor symmetry breaking.\n", "  We investigate the existence of bound states of baryons in a kaon condensate\nusing chiral mean field theory.\n  The interactions are described by an effective SU(3)_L X SU(3)_R chiral\nlagrangian where terms of higher order in density, baryon momentum, and kaon\nmass are suppressed by powers of the symmetry breaking scale, Lambda. We take\nup to next to leading order terms (n = 2,3,4). We search for infinite baryon\nnumber solutions, namely ``strange baryonic matter'', using a Thomas-Fermi\napproximation for a slowly varying condensate and a lowest order Hartree\napproximation to describe the many body interactions. For simplicity we study a\npure K^0 condensate and only neutrons, the lightest baryons in that condensate.\nWe find solutions with neutron number densities, rho_n > 3.5 rho_0, where rho_0\nis the infinite nuclear matter density. This is consistent with the estimate of\nthe onset of a K-condensate at rho_n = 2-4 rho_0. We show that the binding\nenergies, E_b, grow with rho_n and for rho_n < 7 rho_0 (at rho_n > 7 rho_0\nperturbative expansion is lost) we find E_b < 150 MeV (E_b < 70 MeV for rho_n <\n5 rho_0) even in the most favorable cases. These binding energies may be too\nlow for this type of matter to appear and persist in the early universe.\n", "  Recent CDF data of the inclusive jet cross section shows threshold-like\nstructured deviation, around transverse momentum $E_T(j)\\approx 200 \\sim 350$\nGeV. If this data is real, not just some statistical fluctuation, is it\npossible to interpret the anomaly in terms of virtual SUSY effects? The purpose\nof this note is to address this question. However, we find that virtual SUSY\nloop interference effects [near the threshold] are too small to explain the CDF\ndata. Our main conclusion seems to be on the right track if we assume that the\nrecent global analysis of improved parton distributions by Lai et al. is\ncorrect. PACS number(s): 14.65.Ha, 12.38.Bx, 12.60.Jv, 13.85.-t\n", "  Taking advantage of a semirelativistic and a full relativistic representation\nof the quark propagator in an external field we present an unified derivation\nof the semirelativistic potential and of a Bethe-Salpeter like equation for the\nquark-antiquark system. We consider three different models for the evaluation\nof the Wilson loop: the Modified Area Law model (MAL), the Stochastic Vacuum\nModel (SVM) and the Dual QCD (DQCD). We compare the corresponding potentials\nand show that they all agree at the short and the long distances. In the case\nof the Bethe-Salpeter equation we treat explicitly only the MAL model and give\nan expression for the kernel. Then we show that an effective mass operator can\nbe obtained which agrees with the MAL potential in the semirelativistic limit.\nIn the light quark mass limit this mass operator produces straight Regge\ntrajectories with Nambu-Goto slope in agreement with the data. Finally we\nbriefly discuss the mass independence of the hyperfine splitting in the\nheavy-light case.\n", "  The problem of bound states in effective field theories is studied. A\nrescaled version of nonrelativistic effective field theory is formulated which\nmakes the velocity power counting of operators manifest. Results obtained using\nthe rescaled theory are compared with known results from NRQCD. The same ideas\nare then applied to study Yukawa bound states in 1+1 and 3+1 dimensions, and to\nanalyze when the Yukawa potential can be replaced by a delta-function\npotential. The implications of these results for the study of nucleon-nucleon\nscattering in chiral perturbation theory is discussed.\n", "  The conventional approach describes the spherical domain walls by the same\nstate equation as the flat ones. In such case they also must be gravitationally\nrepulsive, what is seemingly in contradiction with Birkhoff's theorem. However\nthis theorem is not valid for the solutions which do not display Minkowski\ngeometry in the infinity. In this paper the solution of Einstein equations\ndescribing the stable gravitationally repulsive spherical domain wall is\nconsidered within the thin-wall formalism for the case of the non-Minkowskian\nasymptotics.\n", "  QCD evolution equations that naturally include longitudinal (non-propagating)\nfields and heavy quarks are derived. We start with the integral equations of\nquantum field kinetics and obtain the master equations, similar to DGLAP\nevolution equations after several consecutive approximations. We demonstrate\nthat in their primary form, the evolution equations include a new element,\nfeed-back via longitudinal fields, leading to a low-x enhancement in the e-p\nDIS cross section. We show that the structure function F_L is very sensitive to\nthe dynamics of the longitudinal fields and that the heavy quarks in evolution\nequations make this effect even more pronounced.\n", "  Some phase transitions of cosmological interest may be weakly first-order and\ncannot be analyzed by a simple perturbative expansion around mean field theory.\nWe propose a simple two-scalar model--the cubic anisotropy model--as a foil for\ntheoretical techniques to study such transitions, and we review its\nsimilarities and dissimilarities to the electroweak phase transition in the\nearly universe. We present numerical Monte Carlo results for various\ndiscontinuities across very weakly first-order transitions in this model and,\nas an example, compare them to epsilon-expansion results. For this purpose, we\nhave computed through next-to-next-to-leading order in epsilon.\n", "  This talk reviews some of the hot topics in spin physics and related\nsubjects, including perturbative QCD predictions for polarized parton\ndistributions and their possible behaviours at small x, the Bjorken and singlet\nsum rules and the treatment of higher orders in perturbative QCD, different\ninterpretations of the EMC spin effect including chiral solitons and the axial\nU(1) anomaly, other experimental indications for the presence of strange quarks\nin the nucleon wave function, implications for dark matter physics, and a few\nwords about polarization as a tool in electroweak physics.\n", "  We studied the sensitivity of the process $e^+e^-\\to \\ell \\nu q\\bar{q}'$ to\nanomalous trilinear gauge boson couplings of the $WW\\gamma$ and WWZ vertices at\nthe center of mass energies $\\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV and 1 TeV. The bounds for the\ncouplings we obtained result from an analysis of a five dimensional angular\ndifferential cross section. In our calculations we included all tree level\nFeynman diagrams contributing to the final state as well as the finite widths\nof the vector bosons. Both unpolarized and polarized beams were considered. We\nfound that the 500 GeV measurements will be at the level of loop contributions\nto the couplings and may show hints of new physics while the 1 TeV should be\nsensitive to new physics at the loop level. We also explored $\\ell\\nu q\\bar{q}$\nfinal states off the W resonance and found that useful information could be\nextracted from this region of phase space.\n", "  We have performed the NLO QCD global fit of BCDMS, NMC, H1 and ZEUS data with\nfull account of point-to-point correlations using the Bayesian approach to the\ntreatment of systematic errors. Parton distributions in the proton associated\nwith experimental uncertainties, including both statistical and systematic ones\nwere obtained. The gluon distribution in the wide region of $x$ was determined\nand it turned out to be softer than in the global analysis using prompt photon\ndata. We also obtained the robust estimate of $\\alpha_s(M_Z) = 0.1146\\pm0.0036\n(75% C.L.)$ based on Chebyshev's inequality, which is compatible with the\nearlier determination of $\\alpha_s$ from DIS data, but with less dependence on\nhigh twist effects.\n", "  Transverse polarization of ${}^3 S_1$ charmonium states, produced directly in\n$p\\bar{p}$ collisions at asymptotically large transverse momentum p_t, has\nemerged as the most prominent test of color octet contributions and spin\nsymmetry in quarkonium production. We present predictions for the polar angle\ndistribution at moderate values of p_t \\sim 4 - 20 GeV, covered by the Tevatron\nRun I data. We update the fits of NRQCD matrix elements and discuss their\ntheoretical uncertainties. With our best fit values, no transverse polarization\nis expected at p_t \\sim 5 GeV, but the angular distribution is predicted to\nchange dramatically as p_t increases to 20 GeV.\n", "  A Fortran-program for the production cross-sections of squarks and gluinos at\nhadron colliders is described. It includes full next-to-leading order SUSY-QCD\ncorrections to all possible final states ($\\squark\\squarkbar, \\gluino\\gluino,\n\\squark\\gluino, \\squark\\squark$). The program allows to calculate total\ncross-sections as well as differential distributions in the transverse momentum\np_t and the rapidity y of one of the outgoing particles. In addition cuts in\np_t and y can easily be implemented.\n", "  A Monte Carlo program is presented for the computation of the most general\ncross section for two-photon production in e+e- collisions at fixed two-photon\ninvariant mass W. Functions implemented for the five gamma* gamma* structure\nfunctions include three models of the total hadronic cross section and the\nlepton-pair production cross section. Prospects of a structure-function\ndetermination through a study of the azimuthal dependence between the two\nscattering planes are outlined. All dependences on the electron mass and the\nphoton virtualities Q_i^2 are fully kept. Special emphasis is put on a\nnumerically stable evaluation of all variables over the full Q_i^2 range from\nQ_{i\\min}^2 \\sim m_e^2 (W/\\sqrt{s})^4 \\ll m_e^2 up to Q_{i\\max}^2 \\sim s. A\ncomparison is made with an existing Monte Carlo program for lepton-pair\nproduction and an equivalent-photon approximation for hadronic cross sections.\n", "  The next-to-leading order chiral pion-nucleon Lagrangian contains seven\nfinite low-energy constants. Two can be fixed from the nucleon anomalous\nmagnetic moments and another one from the quark mass contribution to the\nneutron-proton mass splitting. We find a set of nine observables, which to one\nloop order do only depend on the remaining four dimension two couplings. These\nare then determined from a best fit. We also show that their values can be\nunderstood in terms of resonance exchange related to $\\Delta$ excitation as\nwell as vector and scalar meson exchange. In particular, we discuss the role of\nthe fictitious scalar-isoscalar meson. We also investigate the chiral expansion\nof the two P-wave scattering volumes $P_1^-$ and $P_2^+$ as well as the\nisovector S-wave effective range parameter $b^-$. The one-loop calculation is\nin good agreement with the data. The difference $P_1^- - P_2^+$ signals chiral\nloop effects in the $\\pi N$ P-waves. The calculated D- and F-wave threshold\nparameters compare well with the empirical values.\n", "  The subject of CP violation in B decays is reviewed in the Standard Model\n(SM) and beyond the SM. The present explanation of CP violation in terms of\nphases in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix can be tested through a\nvariety of CP asymmtries in neutral and charged B decays. SM constraints on the\nCKM phases are violated by new mechanisms of CP nonconservation beyond CKM.\nDifferent mechanisms can be distinguished by combining measurements of CP\nasymmetries with rate measurements of so-called penguin B decays.\n", "  We apply Euclidean time methods to phenomenological Dyson-Schwinger models of\nhadrons. By performing a Fourier transform of the momentum space correlation\nfunction to Euclidean time and by taking the large Euclidean time limit, we\nproject onto the lightest on-mass-shell hadron for given quantum numbers. The\nprocedure, which actually resembles lattice gauge theory methods, allows the\nextraction of moments of structure functions, moments of light-cone wave\nfunctions and form factors without `ad hoc' extrapolations to the on-mass-shell\npoints. We demonstrate the practicality of the procedure with the example of\nthe pion form factor.\n", "  Boost-invariant (1+1) dimensional solutions for the Disoriented Chiral\nCondensate (DCC) are obtained numerically, in the context of the $SU(2)_L\n\\otimes SU(2)_R$ non-linear sigma model at O(p^4) in the momentum expansion. We\nignore the mass terms in the Lagrangian, as we are mainly interested in the\nbehavior of the solutions for small values of proper time $\\tau$. The solutions\nobtained at O(p^4) are matched to those of O(p^2) at a late proper time $\\tau\n\\gg 1/m_\\pi$, where $m_\\pi = 140$ MeV is the mass of the pion. We find that at\nO(p^4) the solutions for the DCC do not have singular behavior at early proper\ntimes $\\tau \\ll 1/m_\\pi$. The solutions indicate that for $\\tau \\lsim\n(0.5-0.8)$ fm the O(p^4) corrections become important. We take the sizes of the\nfield derivatives to be indicators of the validity of the momentum expansion.\nThus, we deduce that the O(p^4) solutions can be used to represent the\nqualitative behavior of the DCC down to proper times of about 0.2 fm. Since\nbelow $\\sim 0.2$ fm the formalism is not reliable, we conclude that the\ninclusion of higher order terms beyond O(p^4) is not needed to extend the\nvalidity of the solutions to earlier proper times.\n", "  We construct realistic supergravity models where supersymmetry breaking\narises from the D-terms of an anomalous U(1) gauge symmetry broken at the\nPlanck scale. Effective action for these theories at sub-Planck energies\n(including higher dimensional terms in the superpotential) are severely\nrestricted by the U(1) symmetry and by the assumption that they arise from an\nunderlying renormalizable theory at a higher scale. Phenomenological\nconsequences of these models are studied. They are found to have the attractive\nfeature that the gaugino masses, the A and B terms and the mass splittings\nbetween the like-charged squarks of the first two generations compared to their\naverage masses can all be naturally suppressed. As a result, the electric\ndipole moment of the neutron as well as the flavor changing neutral current\neffects are predicted to be naturally small. These models also predict the\nvalue of the $\\mu$-term to be naturally small and have the potential to\nqualitatively explain the observed mass hierarchy among quarks and leptons. We\nthen discuss examples of high scale renormalizable theories that can justify\nthe choice of the the effective action from naturalness point of view.\n", "  We present a model based on the gauge group SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R \\times\nSU(4)_C with gauge couplings that are found to be unified at a scale near the\nstring unification scale. This model breaks to the MSSM at an intermediate\nscale which is instrumental in producing a neutrino in a mass range that can\nserve as hot dark matter and can also solve the strong CP problem via a\nharmless invisible axion.\n", "  We rederive the $O(\\alpha^5)$ shift of the hydrogen levels in the non-recoil\n($m_e/m_P \\to 0$) limit using Nonrelativistic QED (NRQED), an effective field\ntheory developed by Caswell and Lepage (Phys. Lett. 167B, 437 (1986)). Our\nresult contains the Lamb shift as a special case. Our calculation is far\nsimpler than traditional approaches and has the advantage of being systematic.\nIt also clearly illustrates the need to renormalize (or ``match'') the\ncoefficients of the effective theory beyond tree level.\n", "  We reconsider Hara's theorem in its relation to the well-known properties of\nbeta-decay. All assumptions necessary for the theorem to be true are explicitly\nformulated. Further, we study the W-exchange contribution to weak radiative\ndecays and show that it does not violate Hara's theorem. However, this\ncontribution reveals the essential role of particle mixing in symmetry\nconsiderations and some peculiar features of gauge-invariant amplitudes under\nperturbative expansion. Together they explain an effect, which was treated as\ncontradicting Hara's theorem, without any violation. The properties of\nW-exchange we describe here may have more general importance and should be\ntaken into account in further detailed calculations of weak processes.\n", "  We present an overview of the present status and prospects for progress in\nelectroweak measurements at future collider experiments leading to precision\ntests of the Standard Model of Electroweak Interactions. Special attention is\npaid to the measurement of the W mass, the effective weak mixing angle, and the\ndetermination of the top quark mass. Their constraints on the Higgs boson mass\nare discussed.\n", "  We first introduce the conceptual basis of critical behaviour in strongly\ninteracting matter, with colour deconfinement as QCD analog of the\ninsulator-conductor transition and chiral symmetry restoration as special case\nof the associated shift in the mass of the constituents. Next we summarize\nquark-gluon plasma formation in finite temperature lattice QCD. We consider the\nunderlying symmetries and their spontaneous breaking/restoration in the\ntransition, as well as the resulting changes in thermodynamic behaviour.\nFinally, we turn to the experimental study of strongly interacting matter by\nhigh energy nuclear collisions, using charmonium production to probe the\nconfinement status of the produced primordial medium. Recent results from Pb-Pb\ncollisions at CERN may provide first evidence for colour deconfinement.\n", "  We study integrated and differential rates for the production of charged\nHiggs bosons $H^\\pm$ of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model via b-quark\ninitiated subprocesses in pp collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. In\ndetail, we compute cross sections and distributions of the reactions: $bU \\to\nbDH^+ \\to bD\\tau^+\\nu_\\tau\\oplus C.C.$ and $bU \\to bDH^+ \\to bD t\\bar b \\to\nbDb\\bar b {jj}\\oplus C.C.$, for a $H^\\pm$ scalar in the intermediate (i.e.,\n$M^\\pm<m_t+m_b$) and heavy (i.e., $M^\\pm>m_t+m_b$) mass range, respectively (U\nand D represent generic u- and d-type light quarks). In the first case, a\ndetailed treatment of various possible backgrounds is also given.\n", "  Motivated by the fact that the Higgs is not seen, we have proposed a version\nof the standard model where the scalar doublet is replaced by a vector doublet\nand its neutral member forms a nonvanishing condensate. Gauge fields are\ncoupled to the new vector fields B in a gauge invariant way leading to mass\nterms for the gauge fields by condensation. B-particles become massive because\nof their self interactions. Fermion and gauge field couplings are standard. Low\nenergy charged current phenomenology fixes the condensate. Fermion masses are\ncoming from the condensation and B-particle-fermion couplings. The\nKobayashi-Maskawa description is unchanged. The model has a low mementum scale\nof about 2 TeV. For instance, from tree-graph unitarity at a scale of 1 TeV the\nminimum mass of a charged B-particle is 369 GeV. Such B-particles are shown to\ncopiously produced at high-energy linear $e^+e^-$ colliders. The model survives\nthe test of oblique radiative corrections. To each momentum scale there exists\na range of B masses where the S, T parameters are compatible with the\nexperiment. For instance, at a scale of 1 TeV from the S parameter the minimum\nmass of a charged (neutral) B is 200-350 GeV (400-550 GeV).\n", "  A program including all radiative corrections to the MSSM at the same level\nas the radiative corrections to the SM has been developed and used to perform\nglobal fits to all electroweak data from LEP, SLC and the Tevatron and the\nradiative b->sgamma decay from CLEO. Values of the strong coupling constant at\nthe M_Z scale and $\\sin^2\\theta_{\\overline{MS}}$ are derived, both in the SM\nand MSSM. Recent updates on ectroweak data, which have been presented at the\nWarsaw Conference in summer 1996, reduce the R_b anomaly from a 3.2 \\sigma to a\n1.8 \\sigma effect. In addition, the $b\\rightarrow s\\gamma$ decay is 30% below\nthe SM prediction. In the MSSM light stops and light charginos increase R_b and\ndecrease the $b\\rightarrow s\\gamma$ rate, so both observations can be brought\ninto agreement with the MSSM for the same region of parameter space. However,\nthe resulting $\\chi^2$ value for the MSSM fits is only marginally lower and in\naddition, the splitting in the stop sector has to be unnaturally high.\n", "  We discuss the group theory relevant to the ground-state baryons in large N_c\nQCD. For very large representation, the group generators become classical\nvariables. We find the form of the classical generators for the completely\nsymmetric N index representation of $SU(m)$ as $N\\rightarrow\\infty$ and derive\nan integral formula for the matrix elements of an arbitrary polynomial in the\ngroup generators between low-spin baryon states in the large N limit.\n", "  We investigate the effects of inhomogeneous scalar field configurations on\neffective action at finite temperature. Recently, Walliser et al. have\ncalculated the leading perturbative corrections to the wave function correction\nterm $Z(\\phi,T)$, for the standard model at finite temperature. Here we follow\ntheir results and apply them to calculate the effective energy of the sphaleron\nsolution, including derivative correction term $Z(\\phi,T)$. The dominant\ncontribution to $Z(\\phi,T)$ comes from vector boson loops. We also study the\npossible effects of corrected sphaleron energy on the baryon number violation\nrate in the standard model.\n", "  The phenomenology of a QCD-Pomeron model based on the exchange of a pair of\nnon-perturbative gluons, i.e. gluon fields with a finite correlation length in\nthe vacuum, is studied in comparison with the phenomenology of QCD chiral\nsymmetry breaking, based on non-perturbative solutions of Schwinger-Dyson\nequations for the quark propagator including these non-perturbative gluon\neffects. We show that these models are incompatible, and point out some\npossibles origins of this problem.\n", "  We have calculated inclusive two-jet cross sections in next-to-leading order\nQCD for low Q^2 ep collisions superimposing direct and resolved contributions.\nInfrared and collinear singularities in the virtual and real contributions are\ncancelled with the phase space slicing method. Various inclusive two-jet\ndistributions have been computed. The results are compared with recent data\nfrom the ZEUS collaboration at HERA.\n", "  After briefly reviewing the nonperturbative dynamics of N=1 supersymmetric\nfield theories, soft SUSY breaking mass terms are introduced into the SUSY\ngauge theories and their effects on gauge symmetry breaking pattern are\nstudied. For $N_f<N_c$, we include the dynamics of the non-perturbative\nsuperpotential and use the original (s)quark and gauge fields. For $N_f>N_c+1$,\nwe formulate the dynamics in terms of dual (s)quarks and a dual gauge group\nSU(N_f-N_c). The mass squared of squarks can be negative triggering the\nspontaneous breakdown of flavor and color symmetry. The general condition for\nthe stability of the vacuum is derived. We determine the breaking pattern,\nderive the spectrum, and argue that the masses vary smoothly as one crosses\nfrom the Higgs phase into the confining phase exhibiting the complmentarity.\n", "  We propose two new sources of a substantial tensor polarization of sea\npartons in the deuteron: the diffractive nuclear shadowing which depends on the\nalignment of nucleons in the polarized deuteron and the nuclear excess of pions\nin the deuteron which is sensitive to the spin state of the deuteron. The\ncorresponding tensor structure function $b_{2}(x,Q^{2})$ rises towards small x\nand we predict an about one per cent tensor asymmetry\n$A_{2}(x,Q^{2})=b_{2}(x,Q^{2})/ F_{2d}(x,Q^{2})$ which by almost two orders in\nmagnitude exceeds the effect evaluated earlier in the impulse approximation.\nThe both mechanisms for tensor structure function break the sum rule $\\int dx\nb_{1}(x,Q^{2})=0$ suggested by Close and Kumano. We comment on the impact of\ntensor polarization on the determination of the vector spin structure function\n$g_{1d}(x,Q^{2})$ for the deuteron.\n", "  We predict that the four-loop contribution \\beta_3 to the QCD \\beta function\nin the MS-bar prescription is given by\n  \\beta_3\\simeq 23,600(900) - 6,400(200) N_f + 350(70) N_f^2 + 1.5 N_f^3, where\nN_f is the number of flavours and the coefficient of N_f^3 is an exact result\nfrom large-N_f expansion. In the phenomenologically-interesting case N_f=3, we\nestimate \\beta_3 = (7.6 \\pm 0.1) x 10^3. We discuss our estimates of the errors\nin these QCD predictions, basing them on the demonstrated accuracy of our\nmethod in test applications to the O(N) \\Phi^4 theory, and on variations in the\ndetails of our estimation method, which goes beyond conventional Pade\napproximants by estimating and correcting for subasymptotic deviations from\nexact results.\n", "  Non-decoupling effects related to a large $m_t$ affecting non-oblique\nradiative corrections in vertices ($Z\\bar{b}b$) and boxes ($B$-$\\bar{B}$ mixing\nand $\\epsilon_K$) are very sensitive to the particular mechanism of spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking. We analyze these corrections in the framework of a chiral\nelectroweak standard model and find that there is only one operator in the\neffective lagrangian which modifies the longitudinal part of the $W^+$ boson\nwithout touching the oblique corrections. The inclusion of this operator\naffects the $Z\\bar{b}b$ vertex, the $B$-$\\bar{B}$ mixing and the CP-violating\nparameter $\\epsilon_K$, generating interesting correlations among the hard\n$m_t^4 \\log m_t^2$ corrections to these observables, for example, the maximum\nvertex $Z b\\bar{b}$ correction allowed by low energy physics is about one\npercent.\n", "  ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) is a detector designed to exploit the\nphysics potential of nucleus-nucleus interactions at the LHC. Being a general\npurpose experiment, it will allow a comprehensive study of hadrons, electrons,\nmuons and photons, produced in the collision of heavy nuclei, up to the highest\nparticle multiplicities anticipated (dNch/dy=8000). In addition to heavy\nsystems (Pb-Pb), we will study collisions at smaller energy densities by using\nlower-mass ions (e.g. A~40). Reference data will be obtained from pp and\np-nucleus collisions. The central part of ALICE covers $|\\eta| < 0.9$, and\nconsists of an inner tracker (ITS), a TPC and a particle identification array\n(PID), all embedded in a large magnet with a weak solenoidal field. The\nexperiment is completed by two small area spectrometers in the barrel region\n(an electromagnetic calorimeter, PHOS, and a high momentum PID detector,\nHMPID), a forward muon spectrometer (2 degrees to 9.5 degrees) and a ZDC.\n", "  We analyze the latest published solar neutrino data assuming an arbitrary\nneutrino oscillation/conversion mechanism suppresses the electron neutrino flux\nfrom the Sun independent of energy. For oscillations/transitions into active\n(sterile) neutrinos such mechanisms are ruled out at 99.96 (99.9997) % C.L.\nassuming the standard solar model by Bahcall and Pinnsoneault '95 correctly\npredicts all solar neutrino fluxes within their estimated uncertainties. Even\nif one allows for $^8{\\rm B}$ and $^7{\\rm Be}$ solar neutrino fluxes that are\nvastly different from the ones in contemporary standard solar models these\nmechanisms are strongly disfavored by the data.\n", "  Assuming the ${\\bar D}^0, D^-, D^-_s$ and $B^+, B^0, B_s^0$ mesons belong to\ntriplets of SU(3) flavor symmetry, we analyse the form factors in the\nsemileptonic decays of these mesons. Both quark and meson mass differences are\ntaken into account. We find a number of relations, in agreement with the\npresent data as well as with previous analyses, and predict certain ratios of\nform factors, not yet measured, most notably the D meson decay constant $f_D =\n209 \\pm 39$ MeV.\n", "  We study the renormalization of operators of the type ${\\bar h_{v'}} \\Gamma\nG^{\\mu\\nu} h_v$ in the heavy-quark effective theory (HQET). We construct the\ncombinations of such operators that are renormalized multiplicatively, and\ncalculate their velocity-dependent anomalous dimensions at the one-loop order.\nWe then show that the virial theorem of the HQET is not renormalized, and that\nin the limit of equal velocities the anomalous dimension of the chromo-electric\noperator vanishes to all orders in perturbation theory. This implies an exact\nrelation between renormalization constants, which may help in a future\ncalculation of the two-loop anomalous dimension of the chromo-magnetic\noperator.\n", "  The pure leptonic or semileptonic character of tau decays makes them a good\nlaboratory to test the structure of the weak currents and the universality of\ntheir couplings to the gauge bosons. The hadronic tau decay modes constitute an\nideal tool for studying low-energy effects of the strong interactions in very\nclean conditions; a well-known example is the precise determination of the QCD\ncoupling from tau-decay data. New physics phenomena, such as a non-zero\ntau-neutrino mass or violations of (flavour / CP) conservation laws can also be\nsearched for with tau decays.\n", "  ALEPH has reported a significant excess of four-jet events in the LEP runs\nabove the Z^0 resonance, which however has not been confirmed by the other LEP\ncollaborations. We assume here that this excess corresponds to a physics signal\nand try to interpret it in the context of supersymmetric models with R-parity\nviolation. Associated production of a left and right selectron can explain all\nthe distinctive features of the ALEPH data: the value of the cross section, the\ndi-jet mass difference, the absence of bottom quarks in the final state, and\nthe di-jet charge content. Our proposed scenario makes definite predictions\nwhich can be tested at future LEP runs at higher energies.\n", "  Using dimensional reduction we construct an effective 3D theory of the\nMinimal Supersymmetric Standard Model at finite temperature. The final\neffective theory is obtained after three successive stages of integration out\nof massive particles. We obtain the full 1-loop relation between the couplings\nof the reduced theory and the underlying 4D couplings and masses. The procedure\nis also applied to a general two Higgs doublet model and the Next to Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model.\n  We analyze the effective 3D theory constructed for the MSSM to determine the\nregions of parameter space for which electroweak baryogenesis is possible. We\nfind that the inclusion of all supersymmetric scalars has the effect of\nenhancing the strength of the phase transition. The requirement of a very light\nstop is not necessary for baryogenesis. The phase transition is sufficiently\nfirst order if the lightest Higgs mass, $m_{h} ~< 70$ GeV. We note the\nexistence of potentially interesting regions of parameter space for which\nexisting analysis techniques are inadequate to decide the question.\n", "  A recently proposed Non-Standard Model solution to the problem of low\nsemileptonic branching ratio B_{SL} which suggests a large branching ratio for\nthe decay $b \\to sg$ is critically examined. It is shown that the effects of\nthe Enhanced Chromomagnetic Dipole Operator might lead to significant\nviolations of isospin symmetry in rare radiative decays of B-mesons.\n", "  Meson loop corrections to baryon axial currents are computed in the 1/N\nexpansion. It is already known that the one-loop corrections are suppressed by\na factor 1/N; here it is shown that the two-loop corrections are suppressed by\n(1/N)^2. To leading order, these corrections are exactly what would be\ncalculated in the constituent quark model. Some applications are discussed.\n", "  We introduce new mechanisms for the communication of supersymmetry breaking\nvia gauge interactions. These models do not require complicated dynamics to\ninduce a nonvanishing F term for a singlet. The first class of models\ncommunicates supersymmetry breaking to the visible sector through a ``mediator\"\nfield that transforms under both a messenger gauge group of the dynamical\nsupersymmetry breaking sector and the standard model gauge group. This model\nhas distinctive phenomenology; in particular, the scalar superpartners should\nbe heavier by at least an order of magnitude than the gaugino superpartners.\nThe second class of models has phenomenology more similar to the ``standard\"\nmessenger sectors. A singlet is incorporated, but the model does not require\ncomplicated mechanisms to generate a singlet F term. The role of the singlet is\nto couple fields from the dynamical symmetry breaking sector to fields\ntransforming under the standard model gauge group. We also mention a potential\nsolution to the $\\mu$ problem.\n", "  The properties of Majorana fermions in hot plasma are studied. One-loop\nresummed propagator, dispersion relations and their interpretation are\ndiscussed. It is shown that particle and hole -like solutions appear as in\nDirac/chiral fermion case. The dispersion relations are, however, crucially\ndifferent. We find that, in presence of a large zero temperature bare mass,\nhole -like excitations posses a negligible effective mass. As an example of\nreal application, we consider the neutralinos in the minimal supersymmetric\nextension of the standard model and argue that for realistic values of the soft\nsupersymmetry breaking masses the existence of practically massless hole -like\nexcitations have a considerable effect on the thermal properties, e.g. the\nthermalization rate, of particles interacting with these Majorana excitations.\n", "  The production of soft dileptons in a thermal mesonic medium is discussed in\nthe context of recent CERN experimental data reported by the CERES\nCollaboration. We do not intend to give a general and critical review, but\ninstead concentrate mainly on our approach, however, incorporating many of the\nrecent attempts in the literature. We calculate the contributions to the\ndilepton yield arising from pion annihilation and $\\pi -\\rho$ scattering. It is\nshown that thermal dileptons from $\\pi -\\rho$ scattering give a significant\ncontribution to the low-mass yield, however, it can only partly account for the\nexperimentally observed soft dilepton excess seen in S-Au and Pb-Au collisions\nat SPS energy. The out off-equilibrium effects as well as a dropping vector\nmeson mass are discussed in the context of the thermal dilepton yield. We\nemphasize, following the results of Li, Ko, and Brown, that, until now, the\nbest way to provide a quantitative explanation of the observed enhancement of\nlow-mass dileptons by the CERN experiments is the assumption of a decreasing\nvector meson mass in a high density thermal medium.\n", "  We show how the sum of a hard singularity, $F_{2H}(x,Q^2_0)\\sim x^{-\\lambda}$\nand a soft Pomeron $F_{2P}(x,Q^2_0)\\sim Const.$ for the singlet piece of the\nstructure function $F_{2S}=F_{2H}+F_{2P}$ for $Q_0^2\\sim a few GeV^2$, plus a\nsaturating expression for the strong coupling,\n$\\tilde{\\alpha}_s(Q^2)=4\\pi/\\beta_0 log[(Q^2+\\Lambda^2)/\\Lambda^2]$ give an\nexcellent description of experiment\n  i) For small Q^2, $0\\lsim Q^2\\leq 8.5 GeV^2$, and\n  ii) For large Q^2, $10\\lsim Q^2\\leq 1 500 GeV^2$ if evolved with QCD. The x\nrange is $6\\times10^{-6}\\lsim x \\lsim 0.04$. The description for low Q^2\nimplies self-consistent values for the parameters in the exponents of x both\nfor singlet and nonsinglet. One has to have $\\alpha_{\\rho}(0)=0.48$ and\n$\\lambda=0.470 [\\alpha_P(0)=1.470]$, in uncanny agreement with other\ndeterminations of these parameters, and in particular the results of the large\nQ^2 fits. The fit to data is so good that we may look for signals of a ``triple\nPomeron\" vertex, for which some evidence is found.\n", "  It is shown that the inclusive rate of the rare weak radiative decays $B \\to\nX_s \\gamma$ contains a series of nonperturbative corrections, whose `short\ndistance' scale is set by $m_c^{-1}$, rather than by $m_b^{- 1}$. The first\ncorrection in this series is expressed through the chromomagnetic interaction\nof the $b$ quark inside the $B$ meson and the relative magnitude of the effect\nis determined by the ratio $< {\\overline B} | \\bar b \\sigma \\cdot G b | B > /\nm_c^2$. Though the magnitude of this first correction is suppressed by a\nnumerical coefficient, the sensitivity of the decay rate to the distance scale\n$m_c^{-1}$ may significantly limit the accuracy of purely perturbative\npredictions for the rate.\n", "  When the cross section of J/psi production is considered varying with the\nenergy of the nucleon-nucleon interaction the production of J/psi in pA and AA\ncollisions has been studied using FRITIOF Model. The calculation shows that the\ncross section of J/psi production \"per nucleon-nucleon collision\" decreases\nwith increasing mass number and centrality as a consequence of continuous\nenergy loss of the projectile nucleons to the target nucleons in their\nsuccessive binary nucleon-nucleon collisions . We have compared our model\npredictions with the experimental data of J/psi production.\n", "  We consider the chiral expansion of the octet baryon magnetic moments in\nheavy baryon chiral perturbation theory including all terms which are of order\n$q^4$. These terms are formally of quadratic order in the quark masses. We show\nthat despite the large non-analytic quark mass corrections to the\nColeman-Glashow relations at order $q^3$, including all analytic and\nnon-analytic corrections at order $q^4$, which in total are of moderate size,\nallows for a fit to the measured magnetic moments due to the appearance of\ncounter terms with free coupling constants of natural size. In this scheme, the\n$\\Lambda \\Sigma^0$ transition moment is predicted to be $\\mu_{\\Lambda \\Sigma^0}\n= (1.42 \\pm 0.01) \\mu_N$.\n", "  We discuss the renormalization of local, scalar and pseudoscalar dimension-5\noperators containing a heavy and a light quark field at scales below the\nheavy-quark mass, using the formalism of the heavy-quark effective theory\n(HQET). We calculate the anomalous dimensions of these operators and their\nmixing to one-loop order. We also perform the one-loop matching of gluon and\nphoton penguin operators onto operators of the HQET. We discuss applications of\nour results to the mixing of gluon and photon penguin operators at low\nrenormalization scales, and to the calculation of $1/m_Q^2$ corrections to\nmeson decays constants.\n", "  Three years after the completion of the next-to-leading order calculation,\nthe status of the theoretical estimates of $\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$ is reviewed. In\nspite of the theoretical progress, the prediction of $\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$ is\nstill affected by a 100% theoretical error. In this paper the different sources\nof uncertainty are critically analysed and an updated estimate of\n$\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$ is presented. Some theoretical implications of a value of\n$\\epsilon'/\\epsilon$ definitely larger than $10^{-3}$ are also discussed.\n", "  We investigate the thermal behavior of quarks and antiquarks interacting via\na temperature-dependent linear potential. The quarks are constituent quarks\nwith dynamically generated masses from the background linear $\\sigma$-model.We\nfind a transition from a system of bound mesons to a correlated quark gas at\nthe same temperature as the chiral transition temperature.\n", "  We propose a general scheme for constructing models in which the Standard\nModel (SM) gauge interactions are the mediators of supersymmetry breaking to\nthe fields in the supersymmetric SM, but where the SM gauge groups couple\ndirectly to the sector which breaks supersymmetry dynamically. Despite the\ndirect coupling, the models preserve perturbative unification of the SM gauge\ncoupling constants. Furthermore, the supergravity contributions to the squark\nand slepton masses can be naturally small, typically being much less than 1% of\nthe gauge mediated contributions. Both of these goals can be achieved without\nneed of a fine-tuning or a very small coupling constant. This scheme requires\nrun-away directions at the renormalizable level which are only lifted by\nnon-renormalizable terms in the superpotential. To study the proposed scheme in\npractice, we develop a modified class of models based on $SU(N)\\times SU(N-1)$\nwhich allows us to gauge a $SU(N-2)$ global symmetry. However, we point out a\nnew problem which can exist in models where the dynamical supersymmetry\nbreaking sector and the ordinary sector are directly coupled -- the two-loop\nrenormalization group has contributions which can induce negative $(mass)^2$\nfor the squarks and sleptons. We clarify the origin of the problem and argue\nthat it is likely to be surmountable. We give a recipe for a successful model.\n", "  Very dense and/or hot hadronic substance (e.g. the one with energy density\ngreatly exceeding that of a normal nucleus) transforms itself into a\nsubhadronic substance which obeys macroscopic classical physics, in particular\nsuffers phase transitions. The most popular Single Phase Transition Model\n(SPTM) assumes that the new phase is the Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) consisting of\ndeconfined, chiral symmetric, pointlike \"current\" quarks q and gluons g of\nQuantum Chromodynamics (QCD). This paper is devoted to another, Double Phase\nTransition Model (DPTM) according to which hadronic substance (H) and QGP\ntransform one into another via an intermediate phase consisting of deconfined\nconstituent massive quarks Q which for brevity sake we call also equivalently\nvalons (Q, valonic phase) with broken chiral symmetry (plus pions as Goldstone\nparticles). I. e. we consider the phase transformation chain H-Q-QGP instead of\nusually assumed H-QGP. The phase transition H-Q is the Hagedorn one and\ncorresponds to the Hagedorn temperature. Connection with the relativistic heavy\nion collision is discussed. H-Q transformation may take place even at low (e.g.\nDubna) energies.\n", "  Talk is given at the YITP International Workshop -- `Recent Developments in\nQCD and Hadron Physics'. Recent CDF data of the inclusive jet cross section\nshows anomalous deviation around large transverse momentum $p_{T}(j)\\approx 200\n\\sim 350$ GeV. Is it possible to interpret the anomaly in terms of virtual SUSY\neffects. The answer is `NO', because we find that the virtual SUSY loop\ninterference effects are too small to explain the CDF data.\n", "  In theories with gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking, the scalar tau,\n(${\\tilde \\tau_1}$) is the lightest superpartner for a large range of the\nparameter space. At the large electron positron collider (LEP 2) this scenario\ncan give rise to events with four $\\tau$ leptons and large missing energy. Two\nof the $\\tau$'s ( coming from the decays of ${\\tilde \\tau_1}$'s ) will have\nlarge energy and transverse momentum, and can have similar sign electrical\ncharges.\n  Such events are very different from the usual photonic events that have been\nwidely studied, and could be a very distinct signal for the discovery of\nsupersymmetry.\n", "  I consider the quantity delta(m_1m_2m_3) = M_{q_1q_2q_3} - [M_{q_1q_2bar} +\nM_{q_2q_3bar} + M_{q_1q_3bar}]/2, where the M's represent the ground state\nspin-averaged hadron masses with the indicated quark content and the m's the\ncorresponding constituent quark masses. I assume a logarithmic interquark\npotential, the validity of a nonrelativistic approach, and various standard\npotential model inputs. Simple scaling arguments then imply that the quantity\nR(x)=delta(mmm_3)/delta(m_0m_0m_0) depends only on the ratio x=m/m_3, and is\nindependent of m_0 as well as any parameters appearing in the potential. A\nsimple and accurate analytic determination of delta(mmm_3), and hence R(x), is\ngiven using the 1/D expansion where D is the number of spatial dimensions. When\napplicable, this estimate of R(x) compares very well to experiment -- even for\nhadrons containing light quarks. A prediction of the above result which is\nlikely to be tested in the near future is M_{Sigma_b^*}/2 + [M_{Lambda_b} +\nM_{Sigma_b}]/4 = 5774 +/- 4 MeV/c^2.\n", "  The physics scope of polarized nucleon-nucleon collisions originating from an\ninternal polarized target in the HERA proton beam is summarized. Based on 240\npb^{-1} integrated luminosity at 40 GeV c.m. energy, statistical sensitivities\nare given over a wide (x_F, p_T)-range for a variety of inclusive and exclusive\nfinal states. By measuring single spin asymmetries unique information can be\nobtained on higher twist contributions and their p_T-dependence. From double\nspin asymmetries in both photon and J/psi production it appears possible to\nmeasure the polarized gluon distribution in the range 0.1 < x_{gluon} < 0.4\nwith a good statistical accuracy. Drell-Yan pair production asymmetries in\ndoubly longitudinal mode, measurable in the mass range 3-10 GeV, allow\ndiscrimination between different parametrizations of the polarized light sea\nquark distributions. In doubly transverse mode access to the quark transversity\ndistribution might become possible. Statistically significant results can be\nexpected in the elastic channel.\n", "  Consider a gauge singlet superfield S coupled to a pair of adjoint fields in\na SUSY-GUT. If the tree-level vacuum is flat in S, the vev <S> which defines\nthe GUT scale will be determined via dimensional transmutation at a scale M\nwhere the soft-breaking (mass)^2 vanishes as a result of running from $M_{Pl} =\n(8 \\pi G_N)^{-1/2}$. Because of the large number of adjoint fields $N_A$\ncoupled to S, one finds that M can be generically close to $M_{GUT} = 2 \\times\n10^{16} GeV$:\n  $M \\simeq M_{Pl} \\exp[-16 \\pi^2 \\log(3/2) / (N_A+4) \\lambda^2]$, where\n$\\lambda$ is a Yukawa $\\sim$ 0.7. This work examines the symmetries and\ndynamical constraints required in a SUSY-GUT in order that the desired flatness\nin S is achieved, and that this flatness may survive in a supergravity\nframework.\n", "  We review results of a numerical study of resonant inflaton decay in a wide\nrange of realistic models and parameters. Wide enough parametric resonance can\nwithstand the expansion of the Universe, though account for the expansion is\nvery important for determining precisely how wide it should be. For example,\nthe effective production of particles with mass ten times that of the inflaton\nrequires very large values of the resonance parameter $q$, $q > 10^8$. For\nthese large $q$, the maximal size of produced fluctuations is significantly\nsuppressed by back reaction, $< X^2 > \\sim 10^{-10} M_{Pl}^2$. We discuss some\nphysical implications of our results.\n", "  It has recently been argued that the rate per unit volume of baryon number\nviolation (topological transitions) in the hot, symmetric phase of electroweak\ntheory is of the form $\\eta \\alpha_w^5 T^4$ in the weak-coupling limit, where\n$\\eta$ is a non-perturbative numerical coefficient. Over the past several\nyears, there have been attempts to extract the rate of baryon number violation\nfrom real-time simulations of classical thermal field theory on a spatial\nlattice. Unfortunately, the coefficient $\\eta$ will not be the same for\nclassical lattice theories and the real quantum theory. However, by analyzing\nthe appropriate effective theory on the lattice using the method of hard\nthermal loops, I show that the only obstruction to precisely relating the rates\nin the real and lattice theories is the fact that the long-distance physics on\nthe lattice is not rotationally invariant. (This is unlike Euclidean-time\nmeasurements, where rotational invariance is always recovered in the continuum\nlimit.) I then propose how this violation of rotational invariance can be\neliminated - and the real B violation rate measured - by choosing an\nappropriate lattice Hamiltonian. I also propose a rough measure of the\nsystematic error to be expected from using simpler, unimproved Hamiltonians. As\na byproduct of my investigation, the plasma frequency and Debye mass are\ncomputed for classical thermal field theory on the lattice.\n", "  We consider the nonlocal version of the Weinberg Salam model (following\nKleppe et al.) with a finite parameter $\\Lambda$ signifying a fundamental\nlength scale.We calculate the extra contributions to the anomalous magnetic\nmoment of the muon coming from the nonlocal structure in this model.We find\nthat the nonlocal contribution can be comparable to weak contributions and goes\nto increase theoretical estimates. We use this calculation to determine the\nlimit on the scale of nonlocality.We obtain the result $1/\\Lambda \\lessim 3\n\\times 10^{-16} $cm,which could be improved when present experimental errors\nnarrow down.\n", "  We calculate one-loop corrections to the single-top-quark production via\n$q\\overline{q}' \\to t\\overline b$ at the Fermilab Tevatron from the\nPseudo-Goldstone bosons ( PGBs ) in the framework of one generation technicolor\nmodel. The maximum correction to the total cross section for the\nsingle-top-quark production is found to reach -2.4% relative to the tree-level\ncross section, which may be observable at a high-luminosity Tevatron.\n", "  The background due to the direct diffractive dissociation of the photon into\nthe $\\pi^+\\pi^-$-pair to the \"elastic\" diffractive $\\rho^0$-meson production in\nelectron-proton collisions is calculated. The amplitude for the background\nprocess $\\gamma p \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^- p$ is proportional to the $\\pi$-meson -\nproton cross section. Therefore, describing the HERA data, we can estimate\n$\\sigma (\\pi p)$ at energy $s_{\\pi p}\\sim (2 - 3) \\times 10^{3}$ GeV$^2$ that\nis considerably higher the existing data. At large $Q^2$ the interference\nbetween resonant and non-resonant $\\pi^+ \\pi^-$ production leads also to the\nmore slow increase of the $\\sigma^L/\\sigma^T$ ratio with the mass of the $2\\pi$\n(i.e. $\\rho^0$-meson) state.\n", "  It is argued that the next linear colliders can serve as W factories that may\nbe exploited for precision tests on the properties of the massive gauge bosons.\nThe connection between the probing of the symmetry breaking sector and precise\nmeasurement of the self-couplings of the weak vector bosons is stressed. The\ndiscussion relies much on the impact of the present low-energy data, especially\nLEP1. These have restricted some paths that lead to the exploration of the\nscalar sector through the investigation of the so-called anomalous couplings of\nthe W's and suggest a hierarchy in the classification of these parameters. The\nlimits we expect to set on these couplings at the different modes of the linear\ncolliders are reviewed and compared with those one obtains at the LHC. The\nconclusion is that the first phase of a linear collider running at 500 GeV and\nthe LHC are complementary. Some important issues concerning radiative\ncorrections and backgrounds that need further studies in order that one\nconducts high precision analyses at high energies are discussed.\n", "  It has been known that $R_b$ can be enhanced in the two Higgs doublet model\nif $\\tan \\beta$ is large. We point out that a similar enhancement in $\\Gamma(Z\n\\to \\tau^+ \\tau^-)$ is large enough to place a constraint on such a\npossibility. We obtain a 95% CL upper bound $\\Delta R_b/R_{b} < 0.73%$ in this\nmodel for the $\\overline{MS}$ mass $m_{b} (m_{Z}) = 3.0$ GeV. The 1996 world\naverage is $\\Delta R_{b}/R_{b}$ = $0.97% \\pm 0.51%$. We used the $m_{b}(m_{Z})$\nto determine the bottom Yukawa coupling instead of $m_b(m_{b})$ unlike in\nprevious analyses, and also an improved experimental test of the lepton\nuniversality in $Z$ decay, which made our results qualitatively different.\n", "  It is shown that by assuming Gribov factorization to hold at low $x$ one\nobtains a simple relation between the structure function of the proton and that\nof the photon. By interpreting an observed structure in deep inelastic\nscattering (DIS) of leptons on protons as belonging to the proton, one can\nrelate it to the structure of the exchanged photon, and visa versa. Predictions\nare given for the structure function of real and virtual photons at low $x$ by\nusing data on the proton structure function together with the Gribov\nfactorization relations.\n", "  We demonstrate that field theories involving explicit breaking of continous\nsymmetries, incorporate two generic classes of topological defects each of\nwhich is stable for a particular range of parameters. The first class includes\ndefects of the usual type where the symmetry gets restored in the core and\nvacuum energy gets trapped there. We show however that these defect solutions\nbecome unstable for certain ranges of parameters and decay not to the vacuum\nbut to another type of stable defect where the symmetry in not restored in the\ncore. In the wall case, initially spherical, bubble-like configurations are\nsimulated numerically and shown to evolve generically towards a planar\ncollapse. In the string case, the decay of the symmetric core vortex resembles\nthe decay of a semilocal string to a skyrmion with the important difference\nthat while the skyrmion is unstable and decays to the vacuum, the resulting\nnon-symmetric vortex is topologically stable.\n", "  Two-body non-leptonic decays of B mesons into PT and VT modes are calculated\nusing the non-relativistic quark model of Isgur et al.. The predictions\nobtained for $B \\to \\pi D^*_2, \\rho D_2^*$ are a factor of $3\\sim 5$ below\npresent experimental upper limits. Interesting patterns are obtained for ratios\nof B decays involving mesons with different spin excitations and their\nrelevance for additional tests of forms factor models are briefly discussed.\n", "  We use the recombination and the Thomas Precession Model to obtain a\nprediction for the $\\Lambda _0$ polarization in the $p+p \\to \\Lambda_0+X$\nreaction. We study the effect of the recombination function on the $\\Lambda_0$\npolarization.\n", "  Uniquely heavy with mass at the weak scale, the top quark may have large\nflavor changing couplings to Higgs bosons that are as yet unexplored. We show\nthat such couplings can be directly probed at the LHC through the parton\nsubprocess $c(\\bar c)g \\to t (\\bar t)A^0$, where the pseudoscalar $A^0$\nsubsequently decays into $t \\bar c$ or ${\\bar t} c$, giving rise to the\nintriguing final state of like sign top quark pairs. After demanding\n$\\ell^\\pm\\ell^\\pm$, missing energy and two $b$-jets, the major background turns\nout to be $q\\bar q' \\to Wt \\bar t$, which can be partially suppressed by jet\ncounting. The signal can then manifest itself in the asymmetry of numbers of\n$\\ell^+\\ell^+$ and $\\ell^-\\ell^-$ events. To further improve the signal over\nbackground, efficient $t$ vs. $\\bar t$ tagging methods should be developed.\n", "  In this paper we calculate the O($\\alpha_s$) corrections to the $x_F$- and\n$y$-distributions of lepton pairs produced in collisions of longitudinally\npolarized hadrons. The numerical importance of these corrections is studied and\nconsequences for the extraction of the polarized sea quark distributions from a\nmeasurement of the longitudinally polarized Drell-Yan cross section are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We study the constraints on the CP-violating soft-breaking phases in the\nminimal supersymmetric standard model using the limits on the chromoelectric\ndipole moment of the strange quark extracted from the neutron EDM experiment.\nOur investigation shows that the phase mediated by the gluino exchange diagram\nhas to be very small, $\\phi\\leq 8 10^{-4}$, for the common supersymmetric mass\nof the order of 100 GeV. Then, solving the renormalization group equations\nanalytically by iterations, we calculate the electric dipole moment of the\nneutron in the MSSM with CP-conserving soft-breaking parameters for the case of\nthree and four generations. For the three-generation case we resolve the\napparent discrepancies between order-of-magnitude estimates and numerical\ncalculations existing in the literature. In this case the EDM of the neutron\ndoes not exceed $10^{-32} e cm$. For the four-generation case we show that\nthere is a significant enhancement which renders the EDM of the neutron at a\nmeasurable level of $10^{-26}e cm$.\n", "  We present an isospin analysis of the decay modes B\\to D\\bar{D}, D^*\\bar{D},\nD\\bar{D}^* and D^*\\bar{D}^*, which allows determination of the final-state\ninteraction phases. As these transitions have branching ratios of the order\n10^{-4} or larger, they could be useful in detecting the CP- violating phase\n\\phi_1 \\equiv \\arg (-V^*_{cb} V_{cd} V_{tb} V^*_{td} ) in the first-round\nexperiments of a B-meson factory. The problem of penguin pollution may still be\npresent. Once the Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements are known, it is possible\nto obtain the magnitudes and relative phases of hadronic matrix elements for\nB\\to D^{(*)}\\bar{D}^{(*)}. This will in turn lead to some information about the\npenguin pollution.\n", "  While solving the supersymmetric flavour problem, a U(2) flavour symmetry\nmight be at the origin of the pattern of fermion masses and mixings. The\nconsequences of this hypothesis are spelled out concerning the parameters of\nthe CKM matrix and their observability in B- and K-physics. The relevance of\nsearching for lepton flavour violation and for the electric dipole moments of\nthe electron and the neutron is also emphasized.\n", "  We have shown in hep-ph/9608266 that a neutrino magnetic moment form factor\n$\\mu_{\\nu} (q^2)$ could be considerably amplified at low momentum transfer,$q^2\n\\leq m_N^2$, at the cost of introducing an extra light neutral fermion $N$ with\nmass $m_N$ and nonzero magnetic moment. It was assumed that the magnetic moment\nof $N$ would originate in a renormalizable way at a heavy scale $M$. While the\nenhancement of the neutrino magnetic moment was unambiguous, we stressed that\nin this effective Lagrangian approach an uncertainty persisted about the\nbehaviour of $\\mu_{\\nu} (q^2)$ in the interval $m_N^2 \\ll q^2 \\ll M^2$. This is\nnot unexpected in presence of a nonrenormalizable effective theory (a particle\nwith bare magnetic moment). We show in a simple renormalizable model for the\nmagnetic moment of particle $N$ how a 2 loop calculation solves the ambiguity.\nIn the domain $m_N^2 \\ll q^2 \\ll M^2$ we confirm the result obtained in\nhep-ph/9608266 using a sharp cut-off. It is amusing that the correct results\nare given, as expected, through dimensional regularization in the full theory,\nbut not in the effective lagrangian approach.\n", "  We review a class of dynamical models in which top condensation occurs at the\nweak scale, giving rise to the large top quark mass and other phenomena. This\ntypically requires a color embedding, $SU(3)_c \\rightarrow SU(3)_1\\times\nSU(3)_2$. These models imply many signatures addressable in near term\nexperiments at colliders and in fixed target mode.\n", "  Basing on the previously performed K-matrix analysis of experimental data, we\ninvestigate, in the framework of the propagator matrix (D-matrix) technique,\nthe 1100-1900 MeV mass region, where overlapping resonances $f_0(1300)$,\n$f_0(1500)$, $f_0(1530^{+90}_{-250})$, and $f_0(1780)$ are located. Necessary\nelements of the D-matrix technique are developed. The D-matrix analysis\nconfirms previous K-matrix results: in the region 900-1900 MeV five\nscalar/isoscalar states are located. Four of them are members of the two $q\\bar\nq$-nonets, while one state is an extra for the $q\\bar q$ systematics, being a\ngood candidate for the lightest scalar glueball. The D-matrix analysis shows\nthat this extra state, a candidate for the lightest scalar glueball, is\ndispersed, due to a mixing with $q\\bar q$- states, over three resonances:\n$f_0(1300)$, $f_0(1500)$, and $f_0(1530^{+90}_{-250})$. The broad resonance\n$f_0(1530^+{90}_{-250})$ is a descendant of the lightest glueball carrying\nabout 50% of the gluonium component, the rest of the gluonium is shared between\n$f_0(1300)$ and $f_0(1500)$.\n", "  Recently we have found that integral of the squared Coulomb wave function\ndescribing systemcomposed of charged pion and central charged fragment\n$Z_{eff}$ protons, $|\\psi_r(r)|^2$, times pion source function $\\rho(r)$ (of\nthe size $\\beta$), $\\intdr |\\psi_r(r)|^2 \\rho(r)$, shows a quasiscaling\nbehavior. This is approximately invariant under the following transformation:\n$(\\beta,Z_{eff}) \\to (\\lambda\\beta,\\lambda Z_{eff})$; $\\lambda >0$. We called\nsuch behavior $\\beta-Z_{eff}$ quasiscaling. We examine this quasiscaling\nbehavior in detail. In particular we provide a semi-analytical examination of\nthis behavior and confirm it for the exponential pionic source functions in\naddition to the Gaussian ones and for the production of K mesons as well. When\ncombined with the results of the HBT, a result of the yield ratio allows us to\nestimate the size of the central charged fragment (CCF) to be $125\\le\nZ_{eff}\\le 150$ for Pb+Pb collisions at energy 158 GeV/nucleon. From our\nestimation, the baryon number density $0.024 \\le n_{B}\\le0.036$ [1/fm^3] is\nobtained.\n", "  In the framework of the perturbative QCD and the diquark model of baryons we\nhave obtained the fragmentation functions for heavy quark that split into\npolarized Lambda_b baryons. We predict the longitudinal polarization asymmetry\nfor the prompt Lambda_b produced in electron-positron annihilation at the Z\nresonance and estimate the spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 beauty baryon production rate.\n", "  Electroweak baryogenesis is an interesting theoretical scenario, which\ndemands physics beyond the Standard Model at energy scales of the order of the\nweak boson masses. It has been recently emphasized that, in the presence of\nlight stops, the electroweak phase transition can be strongly first order,\nopening the window for electroweak baryogenesis in the MSSM. For the\nrealization of this scenario, the Higgs boson must be light, at the reach of\nthe LEP2 collider. In this article, we compute the baryon asymmetry assuming\nthe presence of non-trivial CP violating phases in the parameters associated\nwith the left-right stop mixing term and the Higgsino mass $\\mu$. We conclude\nthat a phase $|\\sin \\phi_{\\mu}| > 0.01$ and Higgsino and gaugino mass\nparameters $|\\mu| \\simeq M_2$, and of the order of the electroweak scale, are\nnecessary in order to generate the observed baryon asymmetry.\n", "  We perform a covariant wavepacket analysis of neutrino oscillations taking\ninto account the lifetime of the neutrino production process . We find that\nflavour oscillations in space are washed out when the neutrinos are produced\nfrom long lived resonances - and what may be observed in\nappearance/disappearance experiments is a uniform conversion probability\nindependent of distance.\n  The lifetime of the resonance which produces the neutrinos acts as the the\neffective baseline of the experiment.\n  For this reason the LSND experiment where neutrinos are produced from muon\ndecay has two orders of magnitude more sensitivity to neutrino mass square\ndifference than other experiments where the neutrinos are produced from pion or\nkaon decays.We also show that there are no EPR type oscillations of the\nsecondary decay particles.\n", "  We exploit the fact that within massless perturbative QCD the same Green's\nfunction determines the hadronic contribution to the $\\tau$ decay width and the\nmoments of the $e^+e^-$ cross section. This allows one to obtain relations\nbetween physical observables in the two processes up to an unprecedented high\norder of perturbative QCD. A precision measurement of the $\\tau$ decay width\nallows one then to predict the first few moments of the spectral density in\n$e^+e^-$ annihilations integrated up to $s\\sim m_\\tau^2$ with high accuracy.\nThe proposed tests are in reach of present experimental capabilities.\n", "  We study the single production of heavy neutrinos via the processes $e^-e^+\n\\to \\nu N$ and $e^-\\gamma \\to W^- N$ at future linear colliders. As a base of\nour considerations we take a wide class of models, both with vanishing and\nnon-vanishing left-handed Majorana neutrino mass matrix $m_L$. We perform a\nmodel independent analyses of the existing experimental data and find\nconnections between the characteristic of heavy neutrinos (masses, mixings, CP\neigenvalues) and the $m_L$ parameters. We show that with the present\nexperimental constraints heavy neutrino masses almost up to the collision\nenergy can be tested in the future experiments.\n", "  The masses of quarks and leptons in units of $m_t$ are expressed in powers of\n$\\sigma=\\sqrt{m_c/m_t}$. The regularities found suggest specific mass matrices.\nThey reproduce all masses and mixings in striking agreement with observation. A\n90 degree relative phase angle between the off-diagonal elements of up and down\nquark matrices leads to a maximum magnitude for CP-violation and, for the phase\nangle $\\gamma$ of the unitary triangle, to $\\gamma\\simeq 90^o$.\n", "  In Gravity Unified Theories all operators that are consistent with the local\ngauge and discrete symmetries are expected to arise in the effective low-energy\ntheory. Given the absence of multiplets like 126 of SO(10) in string models,\nand assuming that B-L is violated spontaneously to generate light neutrino\nmasses via a seesaw mechanism, it is observed that string theory solutions\ngenerically face the problem of producing an excessive $\\nu_L-{\\tilde H}$\nmixing mass at the GUT scale, which is some nineteen orders of magnitude larger\nthan the experimental bound of 1 MeV. The suppression of $\\nu_L-{\\tilde H}$\nmixing, like proton longevity, thus provides one of the most severe constraints\non the validity of any string theory solution. We examine this problem in a\nclass of superstring derived models. We find a family of solutions within this\nclass for which the symmetries of the models and an allowed pattern of VEVs,\nsurprisingly, succeed in adequately suppressing the neutrino-Higgsino mixing\nterms. At the same time they produce the terms required to generate small\nneutrino masses via a seesaw mechanism.\n", "  Recent results on diffraction at HERA, as measured by the H1 and ZEUS\ncollaborations, are reviewed. Results on the photon-proton total hadronic cross\nsection, on vector meson production both at small and large photon virtuality\nand on photon diffraction are presented. The experimental signature of\ndiffraction at HERA, as well as the selection methods used by the two\ncollaborations are explained.\n", "  We consider $e e q q$ contact interactions as a possible origin of an excess\nof events above Standard Model predictions in $e^+ p \\to e^+ jet$ at high $Q^2$\nobserved by the H1 and ZEUS collaborations at HERA. The HERA data prefer\nchirality RL or LR contact terms and atomic physics parity violation\nmeasurements severely limit parity-odd contact terms. With equal left-right and\nright-left chirality interactions at an effective scale of order 3 TeV we are\nable to reproduce the main features of the HERA data and still be consistent\nwith Drell-Yan pair production at the Tevatron and hadron production at LEP 2\nand TRISTAN.\n", "  It is proved, that suggested by Jin modified formalism in the external-field\nmethod in QCD sum rules exactly coincides with the formalism used before.\nTherefore, unlike the claims of ref.1, this formalism cannot improve the\npredictability and reliability of external-field sum rule calculations in\ncomparison with those, done by the standard approach.\n  PACS number(s): 12.38.Lg, 11.55.Hx\n", "  We study the Q^2 evolution of the nucleon's chiral-odd twist-3 distribution\nh_L(x,Q^2) starting from the MIT bag model calculation. A simple GLAP equation\nfor h_L(x,Q^2) obtained at large N_c is used for the Q^2 evolution. The\ncorrection due to the finite value of N_c is O(1/N_c^2)\\sim 10% level. It turns\nout that the twist-3 contribution to h_L(x,Q^2) is significantly reduced at\nQ^2=10 GeV^2 in contrast to the g_2(x,Q^2) case. This is due to the fact that\nthe corresponding anomalous dimension for h_L is larger than that for g_2 at\nsmall n (spin).\n", "  The neutrino signal from SN1987A is analysed with respect to spin-flavour\noscillations between electron antineutrinos, $\\bar{\\nu}_{e}$, and muon\nneutrinos, $\\nu_{\\mu}$, by means of a maximum likelihood analysis.\n  Following Jegerlehner et al. best fit values for the total energy released in\nneutrinos, $E_t$, and the temperature of the electron antineutrino,\n$T_{\\bar{\\nu}_{e}}$, for a range of mixing parameters and progenitor models are\ncalculated. In particular the dependence of the inferred quantities on the\nmetallicity of the supernova is investigated and the uncertainties involved in\nusing the neutrino signal to determine the neutrino magnetic moment are pointed\nout.\n", "  A contact four-fermion interaction between light quarks and electrons has\nbeen evoked as a possible explanation for the excess of events observed by HERA\nat high-$Q^2$. We explore the 1-loop effects of such interaction in $\\Gamma(Z^0\n\\to e^+ e^-)$ measured at LEP and impose strong bounds on the lower limit of\nthe effective scale. Our results are able to discard some of the contact\ninteractions as possible explanation for the HERA events.\n", "  We propose possible signatures of `exogamous' combinations between partons in\nthe different W+ and W- hadron showers in e+e- -> W+W- events with purely\nhadronic final states. Within the space-time model for hadronic shower\ndevelopment that we have proposed previously, we find a possible difference of\nabout 10 % between the mean hadronic multiplicity in such purely hadronic final\nstates and twice the hadronic multiplicity in events in which one W decays\nhadronically and the other leptonically, i.e., <N_had(2W)> \\ne 2 <N_{had}(W)>,\nassociated with the formation of hadronic clusters by `exogamous' pairs of\npartons. We discuss the dependence of this possible difference in multiplicity\non the center-of-mass energy, on the hadron momenta, and on the angular\nseparation between the $W^{\\pm}$ dijets. If it were observed, any such\nmultiplicity difference would indicate that the W's do not hadronize\nindependently, and hence raise questions about the accuracy with which the W\nmass could be determined from purely hadronic final states.\n", "  Full expressions of the $B^0_d \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ and $B^0_d \\to \\pi^0 \\pi^0$\namplitudes, given in terms of matrix elements of operators of the effective\nweak Hamiltonian, are used to study the dependence of the relevant branching\nratios on the different contributions. The uncertainty in the extraction of the\nweak phase $\\alpha$ from the measurement of the time-dependent asymmetry in\n$B^0_d \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ decays is also analyzed. We find that, among several\neffects which may enhance the $B^0_d \\to \\pi^0 \\pi^0$ branching ratio, the most\nimportant is due to ``charming penguin\" diagrams that have never been studied\nbefore. These diagrams easily increase $BR(B^0_d \\to \\pi^0 \\pi^0)$ up to a\nvalue of $1-3 \\times 10^{-6}$. The same effect produces, however, a large error\nin the extraction of $\\alpha$ from the measurement of the $B^0_d \\to \\pi^+\n\\pi^-$ time-dependent asymmetry. We show that it is possible to determine\ncharming-penguin amplitudes from the experimental measurement of many decay\nrates. Their effect is impressive in $B^+ \\to \\pi^+ K^0$ and $B^0_d \\to K^+\n\\pi^-$ decays, where charming-penguin contributions easily give values of\n$BR(B^+ \\to \\pi^+ K^0)$ and $BR(B^0_d \\to K^+ \\pi^-)$ of about $1 \\times\n10^{-5}$. Among other possibilities, we also suggest to use $B^0_d \\to K^0 \\bar\nK^0$, the BR of which can be as large as $2-3 \\times 10^{-6}$, to determine the\nsize of charming-penguin amplitudes.\n", "  We calculate the decay constant ratios $f_{\\eta_c}/f_{J/\\psi}$ and\n$f_{\\eta_b}/f_\\Upsilon$. In the calculation we take into account the mock meson\nstructures of the mesons, as well as the difference of the wave functions at\norigin of the vector and pseudoscalar mesons studied by Ahmady and Mendel. We\nfind that the different spin structures of the mesons much affect the ratios.\nWe incorporate our results in the prediction of the branching ratios of $B\\to K\n\\eta_c$.\n", "  We present sensitivity limits on the coefficients of a dimension-6 effective\nLagrangian that parametrizes the possible effects of new physics beyond the\nStandard Model. Our results are based on the study of the process $e^+ e^- \\to\nW^+ W^- \\gamma$ at LEP2 and NLC energies. In our calculations, we include all\nthe new anomalous interactions, involving vector and Higgs bosons, and take\ninto account the Standard Model irreducible background. We analyse the impact\nof these new interactions on the total cross section, including the effects of\nthe initial electron and final W polarizations. We then focus on the operators\nthat will not be constrained by the $e^+ e^- \\to W^+ W^-$ process, obtaining\nlimits based on the photon energy distribution.\n", "  The anomalous behavior of 2-dimensional factorial moment in nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions is studied in some detail using both mini-bias and central collision\ndata of ^{16}O-, ^{32}S- and ^{197}Au-Em interactions from EMU01 experiment.\nThe correct value for the effective Hurst exponent in the analysis of\nhigher-dimensional factorial moment is found to be greater than unity, showing\nclearly the existence of superposition effect in nucleus-nucleus collisions.\n", "  We argue that sufficiently complex grand unified theories involving extra\nstrong intractions that confine at very short distances, may lead to a heavy\naxion solution of the CP problem of QCD. This axion may have a mass within\naccessible energy range, and its low energy interactions emerge through mixing\nwith axial Higgs boson(s). Another signature of this scenario is softly broken\nPeccei-Quinn symmetry in the electroweak Higgs sector. We present a toy GUT\nexhibiting these features.\n", "  The excess of high-$Q^2$ events found by H1 and ZEUS at HERA in $e^+p$\ndeep-inelastic scattering above the Standard Model prediction motivates us to\ncalculate the NLO QCD corrections to the HERA scalar leptoquark (or squark)\nproduction cross sections. We find that the corrections are significant, of\norder 50% in the mass range of interest. We also calculate the leptoquark\naverage transverse momentum squared and find it to be rather small. Various\nleptoquark production cross sections at the Tevatron $p \\bar p$ collider are\nalso considered. We investigate in detail the leptoquark interpretation of the\nHERA data. First we assume a minimal leptoquark model with a single diagonal\nYukawa coupling to first family lepton and quark mass eigenstates only. In this\ncase constraints from atomic parity violating experiments allow only isodoublet\nscalar leptoquark production at HERA. This interpretation can be confirmed or\nruled out in the near future by high luminosity data at the Tevatron. The\nTevatron data already appear to rule out the vector leptoquark interpretation\nof the HERA data. We also consider a more general model which allows for all\npossible left-handed, right-handed, flavour and lepton number changing\ncouplings. The allowed values of the Yukawa couplings of this general model\noffer several different interpretations of the data which are radically\ndifferent from the minimal model solutions. However these somewhat ad hoc tuned\nsolutions can easily be tested by future HERA experiments.\n", "  Four of the six parameters defining the two-loop \\pi\\pi scattering amplitude\nhave been determined using Roy dispersion relations. Combining this information\nwith the Standard \\chi PT expressions, we obtain the threshold parameters,\nlow-energy phases and the O(p^4) constants $l_1^r, l_2^r$. The result $l_2^r (\nM_{\\rho} ) = ( 1.6 \\pm 0.4 \\pm 0.9 ) \\times 10^{-3} ( {\\bar l_2} = 4.17 \\pm\n0.19 \\pm 0.43$) reproduces the correct D-waves but it is incompatible with\nexisting Standard \\chi PT analyses of $K_{l4}$ form factors beyond one loop.\n", "  We examine the effect of an anomalous flavor changing chromomagnetic moment\nwhich allows direct top quark production (two partons combining into an\nunaccompanied single top quark in the s-channel) at hadron colliders. We\nconsider both t-c-g and t-u-g couplings. We find that the anomalous charm quark\ncoupling parameter $\\kappa_c / \\Lambda$ can be measured down to $.06\nTeV^{-1}(.009 TeV^{-1}$) at the Tevatron with the Main Injector upgrade(LHC).\nThe anomalous up quark coupling parameter $\\kappa_u / \\Lambda$ can be measured\nto $.02 TeV^{-1}(.003 TeV^{-1}$) at the Tevatron(LHC).\n", "  Determination of the characteristic CP-violating quantity \\sin (2\\beta)\nshould be the central goal of a B-meson factory in its first-round experiments.\nExcept the gold-plated channels B_d\\to \\psi K_S and \\psi K_L, three other types\nof B_d decays to CP eigenstates can also serve for the extraction of \\sin\n(2\\beta) in the standard model: (a) the CP-forbidden transitions\n(B_d\\bar{B}_d)_{\\Upsilon (4S)} \\to (X_c K_S) (X_c K_S) and $(X_c K_L) (X_c\nK_L), where X_c = \\psi, \\psi', \\eta_c, etc; (b) the decay modes B_d\\to\nD^{(*)+}D^{(*)-} and D^{(*)0}\\bar{D}^{(*)0}, whose amplitudes have simple\nisospin relations; and (c) the decay modes B_d\\to (f_{CP})_D + (\\pi^0, \\rho^0,\na^0_1, etc), in which f_{CP} is a CP eigenstate (such as \\pi^+\\pi^-, K^+K^- or\nK_S \\pi^0) arising from either D^0 or \\bar{D}^0 in the neglect of D^0-\\bar{D}^0\nmixing. We carry out an analysis of the CP-violating signals existing in these\ntypical processes, without loss of the possibility that new physics might\nsignificantly affect B^0_d-\\bar{B}^0_d or K^0-\\bar{K}^0 mixing. We also show\nthat the magnitude of \\sin (2\\beta) can be well determined, in terms of only\n|V_{us}|, m_d/m_s and m_u/m_c, from a variety of quark mass ansatze.\n", "  In view of the discovery potential associated with the future experiments of\nhigh-luminosity fixed target facilities, B-meson factories and \\tau-charm\nfactories, we highlight some typical signals of D^0-\\bar{D}^0 mixing and CP\nviolation which are likely to show up in neutral D-meson decays to the\nsemileptonic final states, the hadronic CP eigenstates, the hadronic non-CP\neigenstates and the CP-forbidden states. Both time-dependent and\ntime-integrated measurements are discussed, and particular interest is paid to\nD^0/\\bar{D}^0 \\to K_{S,L}+\\pi^0 and D^0/\\bar{D}^0\\to K^{\\pm}\\pi^{\\mp}\ntransitions.\n", "  The baryon asymmetry of the universe can be explained by the\nout-of-equilibrium decays of heavy right-handed neutrinos. We analyse this\nmechanism in the framework of a supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model\nand show that lepton number violating scatterings are indispensable for\nbaryogenesis, even though they may wash-out a generated asymmetry. By assuming\na similar pattern of mixings and masses for neutrinos and up-type quarks, as\nsuggested by SO(10) unification, we can generate the observed baryon asymmetry\nwithout any fine tuning, if $(B-L)$ is broken at the unification scale\n$\\Lambda_{GUT}\\sim 10^{16} $GeV and, if $m_{\\n_\\m} \\sim 3\\cdot 10^{-3} $eV as\npreferred by the MSW solution to the solar neutrino deficit.\n", "  We reply to the Comment by Hatsuda and Lee on our recent paper \"Meson Masses\nin Nuclear Matter\" (Phys.Rev.Lett. 78, 1010, (1997)). We argue that, contrary\nto the claim in the Comment, the short distance operator product expansion is\nnot applicable for calculation of meson mass shifts in nuclear matter, since\nthey are determined by long distance physics. We also remark that the\nsuggestion made in the Comment that we overlooked in our paper the mean field\ndescription of the mass shifts of low-q mesons is perhaps due to a\nmisunderstanding.\n", "  Results of complete tree level calculations of the single top production\nreaction $\\gamma e \\to \\nu \\bar{t} b$ at the Next Linear Collider, including\nthe contribution of anomalous operators to the Wtb coupling are presented. The\nsensitivity for probing the structure of the Wtb coupling in a model\nindependent way is analyzed and found to be significantly higher than for\ncomparable measurements at the Tevatron.\n", "  The background due to the direct diffractive dissociation of the photon into\nthe $\\pi^+\\pi^-$-pair to the \"elastic\" diffractive $\\rho^0$-meson production in\nelectron-proton collisions is calculated. At large $Q^2$ the interference\nbetween resonant and non-resonant $\\pi^+ \\pi^-$ production changes the\n$\\sigma^L/\\sigma^T$ ratio with the mass of the $2\\pi$ (i.e. $\\rho^0$-meson)\nstate.\n", "  The light-cone Hamiltonian, incorporating the nonperturbative dynamics of the\n$q\\bar q$ system connected by the string is solved numerically. The spectrum is\nshown to coincide with that of the center-of-mass Hamiltonian within the\naccuracy of computation, displaying the expected degeneracies of the string\nstates, but an overall shift due to different treatment of Z-graphs is\nobtained. The nonperturbative wave functions are calculated directly from the\nlight-cone Hamiltonian for the first time, thus allowing the explicit\nestimation of nonperturbative effects in the parton model language. In this way\none obtains the string contribution to the parton distributions and in the\nformfactors and structure functions.\n", "  The gluon radiation induced by multiple scattering of a hard parton in\nexpanding quark-gluon plasma is investigated. The radiative energy loss of hard\nparton jet is shown to decrease considerably when angular size of extracted jet\ngoes up, but the fraction of loss survives even for the reasonable wide cone of\nangles due to the coherent effects taking into account the rescattering of the\nradiated gluons in the QCD medium. The possible application to the jet\nquenching phenomenon in heavy ion collisions at LHC energies is discussed.\n", "  We examine the ability of future facilities to discover and interpret\nnon-supersymmetric new phenomena. We first explore explicit manifestations of\nnew physics, including extended gauge sectors, leptoquarks, exotic fermions,\nand technicolor models. We then take a more general approach where new physics\nonly reveals itself through the existence of effective interactions at lower\nenergy scales. [Summary Report of the New Phenomena Working Group. To appear in\nthe Proceedings of the 1996 DPF/DPB Summer Study on New Directions for High\nEnergy Physics - Snowmass96, Snowmass, CO, 25 June - 12 July 1996.]\n", "  We provide a detailed, model-independent, study for CP violation effects due\nto the T-odd top-quark electric dipole moment (EDM) and weak dipole moment\n(WDM) in the top-quark pair production via $e^+e^-$ and two-photon annihilation\nat a next $e^+e^-$ linear collider (NLC). There are two methods in detecting CP\nviolation effects in these processes. One method makes use of measurements of\nvarious spin correlations in the final decay products of the produced top-quark\npair, while the other is to measure various CP-odd polarization asymmetry\neffects of the initial states. In the $e^+e^-$ case only the first method can\nbe used, and in the $\\gamma\\gamma$ case both methods can be employed. We\nprovide a complete classification of angular correlations of the $t$ and\n$\\bar{t}$ decay products under CP and CP\\tilde{T} which greatly faciliate CP\ntests in the $e^+e^-$ mode. Concentrating on the second method with the Compton\nback-scattered high-energetic laser light off the electron or positron beam in\nthe two-photon mode, we construct two CP-odd and CP\\tilde{T}-even initial\npolarization configurations and apply them to investigating CP-violating\neffects due to the top-quark EDM. With a typical set of experimental parameters\nat the NLC, we compare the 1-\\sigma sensitivities to the top-quark EDM and WDM\nin the $e^+e^-$ mode and the two-photon mode. Some model expectation values of\nthe T-odd parameters are compared with the results.\n", "  We present the cross section for pair production of scalar leptoquarks $LQ$\nin $p\\bar{p}$ collisions, $p+\\bar{p} \\to LQ + \\bar{LQ} + X$, at the Fermilab\nTevatron in next-to-leading order QCD. Including the higher-order corrections\nstabilizes the theoretical prediction and increases the size of the cross\nsection for renormalization/factorization scales close to the mass of the\nleptoquarks. This leads to an increase of the lower bound on the mass of scalar\nleptoquarks by up to 15 GeV with respect to earlier analyses.\n", "  Recent data on inclusive B decays into charmonium states taken by the CLEO\ncollaboration suggest that a sizeable fraction of the nonleptonic decays may\nconsist of the $J/\\psi \\Lambda \\overline p$ three body final state,\ncorresponding to a distinct enhancement in the inclusive $J/\\psi$ momentum\ndistribution. The kinematical boundary of this structure corresponds to the\ncase where the $J/\\psi$ recoils nearly monoenergetically in the B rest system\nagainst a partner having mass of $\\simeq$ 2 GeV. This may allow the observation\nof a $\\Lambda-\\overline p $ bound state near or just below threshold; i.e.,\nstrange baryonium, even if the production rate is small.\n  Using a phase space approach to the B meson decay, we study the $J/\\psi$\nmomentum distribution and the effect of baryonium formation. We also discuss\nthe possible observation of pentaquarks and hadronically-bound $J/\\psi$ by the\nobservation of monoenergetic baryons in these decays.\n", "  In the bound state approach the heavy baryons are constructed by binding,\nwith any orbital angular momentum, the heavy meson multiplet to the nucleon\nconsidered as a soliton in an effective meson theory. We point out that this\npicture misses an entire family of states, labeled by a different angular\nmomentum quantum number, which are expected to exist according to the geometry\nof the three-body constituent quark model (for N_C=3). To solve this problem we\npropose that the bound state model be generalized to include orbitally excited\nheavy mesons bound to the nucleon. In this approach the missing angular\nmomentum is ``locked-up'' in the excited heavy mesons. In the simplest\ndynamical realization of the picture we give conditions on a set of coupling\nconstants for the binding of the missing heavy baryons of arbitrary spin. The\nsimplifications made include working in the large M limit, neglecting nucleon\nrecoil corrections, neglecting mass differences among different heavy spin\nmultiplets and also neglecting the effects of light vector mesons.\n", "  The lack of deviations from the Standard Model at the current level of\nexperimental precision can be explained systematically in suitable models of\ndynamical electro-weak symmetry breaking. The key ingredient is dynamics which\nproduces a scalar unitarity partner for the Goldstone-Bosons and which leads to\na decoupling of effects beyond the Standard Model. A phenomenologically\nsuccessful left-right symmetric model is presented from this point of view.\n", "  Uncertainties in the theoretical prediction for the inclusive $\\bar B\\to\nX_s\\gamma$ decay rate are examined. Certain nonperturbative effects involving a\nvirtual $c\\bar c$ loop, which are calculable using the operator product\nexpansion, are discussed.\n", "  We derive a set of relations among the thermal components of the 3-point\nfunction and its spectral representations at finite temperature in the\nreal-time formalism. We then use these to explicitly calculate the 3-point\nspectral densities for $\\phi^3_6$ theory and relate the result to the case of\nhot QCD.\n", "  The catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking in the massless weakly coupled QED\nin a magnetic field at finite temperature is studied. The temperature of the\nsymmetry restoration is estimated analytically as $T_c\\simeq m_{dyn}$, where\n$m_{dyn}$ is the dynamical mass of a fermion at zero temperature.\n", "  We show that the s-wave pion-nuclear potential which reproduces the deeply\nbound pionic states in Pb, recently discovered at GSI, is remarkably close to\nthe one constructed directly from low energy theorems based on chiral symmetry.\nConverting this information into an effective pion mass we find\n$m_\\pi^\\star/m_\\pi\\simeq 1.13$ in the center of the Pb nucleus, and\n$m_\\pi^\\star/m_\\pi\\simeq 1.07$ in symmetric nuclear matter.\n", "  We calculate the relic density ($\\Omega_{\\chi^0_1} h^2$) of neutralino dark\nmatter in supergravity models with radiative electroweak symmetry breaking, for\nvalues of the Higgs sector parameter $\\tan\\beta \\equiv v_2/v_1$ between the two\ninfrared fixed points of the top quark Yukawa coupling, $\\tan\\beta \\simeq 1.8$\nand $\\tan\\beta \\simeq 56$. For $\\tan\\beta \\alt 10$, the CP-odd Higgs\npseudoscalar ($A^0$) and the heavier CP-even Higgs scalar ($H^0$) are much\nheavier than the lightest neutralino ($\\chi^0_1$), and the annihilation cross\nsection of $\\chi^0_1$ pairs is significantly enhanced only in the vicinity of\nthe lighter CP-even Higgs boson ($h^0$) and the $Z$ boson poles. For $\\tan\\beta\n\\agt 40$, $m_A$ and $m_H$ become comparable to $2m_{\\chi^0_1}$, and the\nneutralino annihilation cross section can be significantly enhanced by the\npoles of the $H^0$ and the $A^0$ as well. For a cosmologically interesting\nrelic density, $0.1 \\alt \\Omega_{\\chi^0_1} h^2 \\alt 0.5$, we find that the\nsupergravity parameter space is tightly constrained. The mass spectra for\nsupersymmetric particles are presented for unification mass parameters in the\ncosmologically interesting region.\n", "  Alternatives for describing the nonlinear behavior of the first diffraction\ncone in differential $pp$ and $\\bar pp$ elastic cross-section are investigated.\nHigh quality fits to the data are presented. We show that the presence in the\nPomeron amplitude of two terms with different $t$ dependences is strongly\nsuggested by the data, hinting at a non-factorizable Pomeron even in the field\nof purely hadronic reactions. The available data, however, do no allow to\nchoose among a nonlinearity in the residues or in the Pomeron trajectory or in\nboth. In all cases, we find an effective slope of the trajectory larger than\nthe one currently used. A nonlinear trajectory with the fitted parameters is\nused for predicting the mass and the width of the 2$^{++}$ glueball. An\nexcellent agreement is found with the X(1900) candidate from the WA91\nexperiment.\n", "  We calculate the cross-sections for the production of Standard Model Higgs\nBoson in association with the neutral gauge bosons (photon and Z--boson). For\nthe case of reaction $\\mu^+ \\mu^- \\to \\gamma H^0$, complete and compact\nanalytical expressions for the differential and total cross--sections,\napplicable also for the case of any (pseudo)scalar particle with mass-coupling\nproportionality, in particulary, for an axion are given. Reaction $\\mu^+ \\mu^-\n\\to Z^0 H^0$ is some \"generalization\" of the well-known \"Bjorken process\" for\nthe case of $ e^+ e^-$ collisions. Various distributions for both the processes\nabove are illustrated for the energies, which will be reached at future $\\mu^+\n\\mu^-$ colliders. Study of those processes will be evidently complementary to\nthe precision measurements at the Higgs resonance region.\n", "  The heavy quark expansion of Quantum Chromodynamics and the strong coupling\nflux tube picture of nonperturbative glue are employed to develop the\nphenomenology of hybrid meson decays. The decay mechanism explicitly couples\ngluonic degrees of freedom to the pair produced quarks and hence does not obey\nthe well known, but model-dependent, selection rule which states that hybrids\ndo not decay to pairs of L=0 mesons. However, the nonperturbative nature of\ngluonic excitations in the flux tube picture leads to a new selection rule:\nlight hybrids do not decay to pairs of identical mesons. New features of the\nmodel are highlighted and partial widths are presented for several low lying\nhybrid states.\n", "  We analyse the consequences of the usual assumption of a constant function to\nfit non-resonant decays from experimental Dalitz plot describing charmed meson\ndecays. We first show, using the $D^+\\to \\bar{K}^0\\pi^+\\pi^0$ decay channel as\nan example, how an inadequate extraction of the non-resonant contribution could\nyield incorrect measurements for the resonant channels. We analyse how the\ncorrect study of this decay will provide a test for the validity of\nfactorization in D meson decays. Finally, we show how form factors could be\nextracted from non-resonant decays. We particularly discuss about the form\nfactor that can be measured from the $D^+_s\\to \\pi^-\\pi^+\\pi^+$ decay. We\nemphasize on its relevance for the study of the decay $\\tau \\to \\nu_{\\tau}\n3\\pi$ and the extraction of the $a_1$ meson width.\n", "  We investigate several fluctuation effects in high-energy hadronic and\nnuclear collisions through the analysis of different observables. To introduce\nfluctuations in the initial stage of collisions, we use the Interacting Gluon\nModel (IGM) modified by the inclusion of the impact parameter. The inelasticity\nand leading-particle distributions follow directly from this model. The\nfluctuation effects on rapidity distributions are then studied by using\nLandau's Hydrodynamic Model in one dimension. To investigate further the\neffects of the multiplicity fluctuation, we use the Longitudinal Phase-Space\nModel, with the multiplicity distribution calculated within the hydrodynamic\nmodel, and the initial conditions given by the IGM. Forward-backward\ncorrelation is obtained in this way.\n", "  We reexamine the limits on the gravitino mass supplied by the muon anomaly in\nthe frame of supergravity models with a superlight gravitino and a superlight\nscalar S and a superlight pseudoscalar P.\n", "  In this article we discuss the problem of the extreme fine-tuning necessary\nto achieve the top quark mass scale $m_t$ within the dynamical symmetry\nbreaking of the phenomenological $t \\bar t$ condensate model. Inspired by the\nvector-like phenomenon of chiral gauge theories at short distances, we\npostulate that the $W^\\pm$-gauge bosons possess a vector-like gauge coupling\nand contribute to the gap-equations of quark self-energy functions in the\nhigh-energy region. We find that the gap-equations of different charge sectors\nare coupled, and as a result the unnatural fine-tuning is overcome and the\nratio of the top and bottom masses is related to the electric charge:\n$({m_b\\over m_t})^2\\simeq {\\alpha\\over3\\pi}$, provided the quadratic divergence\nis removed by setting the four-fermion coupling $G=4+o({m_b^2\\over m_t^2})$.\n", "  CERN dilepton experiments have provided the most exciting data. Strong\nenhancement at low masses observed by CERES and HELIOS3 indicate strong\nmodification in the vector channel in matter compared to vacuum properties.\nNA50 data on $J/\\psi$ suppression in PbPb collisions show surprising deviation\nfrom the previous trend. The question is whether it is the expected early-time\nsignal of QGP, or due to late-time hadronic interactions.\n  Theoretical and experimental suggestions have been made to resolve this\nissue. BNL and SPS experiments have also provided rather complete data with\nheavy beams (Au and Pb, respectively). Very strong collective flow effects have\nbeen observed at both energies, which allow for the first time to restrict the\nEOS of the hadronic matter. Several observables (flow, Coulomb effects and HBT)\nsuggest rather long evolution of systems created in heavy ion collisions and\nvery low freeze-out densities relative to previous studies. Theory of jet\nstopping in QGP is becoming quantitative.\n", "  This talk consists of two very different parts: the first one deals with\nnon-perturbative QCD and physics of the chiral restoration, the second with\nrather low-key (and still unfinished) work aiming at obtaining EOS and other\nproperties of hot/dense hadronic matter from data on heavy ion collisions. The\nmicroscopic mechanism for chiral restoration phase transition is a transition\nfrom randomly placed tunneling events (instantons) at low T to a set of\nstrongly correlated tunneling-anti-tunneling events (known as instanton -\nanti-instanton molecules) at high T. Many features of the transition can be\nexplained in this simple picture, especially the critical line and its\ndependence on quark masses. This scenario predicts qualitative change of the\nbasic quark-quark interactions around the phase transition line, with some\nstates (such as pion-sigma ones) probably surviving even at $T>T_c$. In the\nsecond half of the talk we discuss experimental data on collective flow in\nheavy ion collision, its hydro-based description and relation to equation of\nstate (EOS). A distinct feature of the QCD phase transition region is high\ndegree of ``softness'', (small ratio pressure/energy density).\n  We present some preliminary results indicated that it is indeed needed to\nexplain the radial flow at SPS energies.\n", "  The collimation $C$ of a hadronic event in the e^+e^- annihilation is defined\nas the average of $\\cos\\theta$, $C=<\\cos\\theta>$, where $\\theta$ is the angle\nof each hadron measured from the thrust axis, and the average is over all the\nhadrons produced in an event. It is an infrared-stable event-shape parameter.\n$1-\\bar C$, the difference between the unity and the average collimation at a\ngiven energy, is proportional to the anomalous dimension of the hadron\nmultiplicity at the leading order in MLLA. Its next-to-leading order\ncorrections are calculated.\n", "  We calculate nonperturbative ${\\cal O}(\\Lambda^2_{QCD}/m^2_c)$ corrections to\nthe dilepton invariant mass spectrum and the forward-backward charge asymmetry\nin $B\\to X_se^+e^-$ decay using a heavy quark expansion approach. The method\nhas recently been used to estimate long-distance effects in $B\\to X_s\\gamma$.\nWe generalize this analysis to the case of nonvanishing photon invariant mass,\n$q^2\\not= 0$, relevant for the rare decay mode $B\\to X_se^+e^-$. In the\nphenomenologically interesting $q^2$ region away from the $c\\bar c$ resonances,\nthe heavy quark expansion approach should provide a reasonable description of\npossible nonperturbative corrections. In particular this picture is preferable\nto the model-dependent approach relying on the tails of Breit-Wigner\nresonances, which has been employed so far in the literature to account for\nthese effects. We find that the ${\\cal O}(\\Lambda^2_{QCD}/m^2_c)$ corrections\nto the dilepton invariant mass spectrum and to the forward-backward asymmetry\nin $B\\to X_se^+e^-$ amount to several percent at most for $q^2/m^2_b < 0.3$ and\n$q^2/m^2_b > 0.6$. The ${\\cal O}(\\Lambda^2_{QCD}/m^2_c)$ correction to the\n$B\\to X_s\\gamma$ decay rate is also computed and found to be +3%, which agrees\nin magnitude with previous calculations. Finally, we comment on long-distance\neffects in $B\\to X_s\\nu\\bar\\nu$, which in this case are extremely suppressed\ndue to the absence of virtual photon contributions.\n", "  We study the production of $c \\bar{c}$ pairs and dimuons from hard collisions\nin nuclear reactions within the covariant transport approach HSD, which\ndescribes successfully both hadronic and electromagnetic observables from p+A\nand A+A collisions from SIS to SPS energies. The production of $c \\bar{c}$ and\nDrell-Yan pairs is treated perturbatively employing experimental cross sections\nwhile the interactions of $c\\bar{c}$ pairs with hadrons are included by\nconventional cascade-type two-body collisions. Adopting 6mb for the $c\n\\bar{c}$-baryon cross sections the data on $J/\\Psi$ suppression in p+A\nreactions are reproduced in line with calculations based on the Glauber model.\nWe study different models for $c \\bar{c}$ dissociation on mesons in comparison\nwith the experimental data of the HELIOS-3, NA38 and NA50 collaborations.\nAdopting absorption cross sections with mesons above the $D\\bar{D}$ threshold\nin the order of 1.5 - 3mb we find that all data on $J/\\Psi$ suppression from\nboth proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions can be described without\nassuming the formation of a quark-gluon plasma in these collisions.\n", "  CP violation in $B$ decays is reviewed in the Standard Model (SM) and beyond\nthe SM. The present explanation of CP violation in terms of a phase in the\nCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix can be tested through a variety of CP\nasymmetries in neutral and charged $B$ decays. Usually, new mechanisms of CP\nnonconservation enter via $B-\\bar{B}$ mixing and violate SM constraints on the\nCKM parameters in a few characteristic ways. Different models can be partially\ndistinguished by penguin-dominated $B$ decay rate measurements. In radiative\ndecays, large mixing-induced asymmetries may occur due to new contributions to\nthe decay amplitude.\n", "  In a model where constituent quarks and diquarks interact through quark\nexchange the Bethe-Salpeter equation in ladder approximation for the nucleon is\nsolved. Quark and diquark confinement is effectively parametrized by choosing\nappropriately modified propagators. The coupling to external currents is\nimplemented via nontrivial vertex functions for quarks and diquarks to ensure\ngauge invariance at the constituent level. Nucleon matrix elements are\nevaluated in a generalised impulse approximation, and electromagnetic, pionic\nand axial form factors are calculated.\n", "  We present a simple model of gauge mediation (GM) which does not have a\nmessenger sector or gauge singlet fields. The standard model gauge groups\ncouple directly to the sector which breaks supersymmetry dynamically. This is\nthe first phenomenologically viable example of this type in the literature.\nDespite the direct coupling, the model can preserve perturbative gauge\nunification. This is achieved by the inverted hierarchy mechanism which\ngenerates a large scalar expectation value compared to the size of\nsupersymmetry breaking. There is no dangerous negative contribution to the\nsquark, slepton masses due to two-loop renormalization group equation. The\npotentially non-universal supergravity contribution to the scalar masses can be\nsuppressed enough to maintain the virtue of the gauge mediation. The model is\ncompletely chiral, and one does not need to forbid mass terms for the messenger\nfields by hand. Beyond the simplicity of the model, it possesses cosmologically\ndesirable features compared to the original models of GM: an improved gravitino\nand string moduli cosmology. The Polonyi problem is back unlike in the original\nGM models, but is still much less serious than in hidden sector models.\n", "  Using the SU(2) gauge coupling, $g_{W^\\pm} (M^2_{W^\\pm})$, at the high-energy\nscale of $M_{W^\\pm}$, defined by the (theoretical value of the) leptonic\nW-width, rather than using the low-energy value, defined via the Fermi\ncoupling, $G_\\mu$, in the Born approximation, and supplementing with Coulomb\ncorrections and initial state radiation, errors with respect to the exact\none-loop results for the differential cross section of $e^+e^-\\to W^+W^-$ are\nbelow 1% at LEP 2 energies at all $W^+W^-$ production angles. A similar\nprocedure is suggested to incorporate leading bosonic loop effects into\nfour-fermion production in the fermion-loop scheme. The resulting accuracy\nbelow 1% is sufficient for LEP 2 experiments.\n", "  We recently completed a calculation of the process $e^+e^- \\to Q\\bar{Q}+X$,\nwhere Q is a heavy quark, at order $O(\\alpha_s^2)$. As a first application of\nthis calculation we compute the momentum correlations of $b\\bar{b}$ pairs at\nnext-to-leading-order. This quantity is interesting since it may affect the\ndetermination of $R_b$ as measured in $Z^0$ decays. We find that the\nnext-to-leading corrections are of moderate size, thus confirming the\nconclusions that can be drawn from the leading-order calculation.\n", "  We study non-perturbative real time correlation functions at finite\ntemperature. In order to see whether the classical term gives a good\napproximation in the high temperature limit T >> \\hbar\\omega, we consider the\nfirst \\hbar^2 quantum corrections. We find that for the simplest non-trivial\ncase, the quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator, the classical result is\nreliable only for moderately large times: after some time t_* the classical\napproximation breaks down even at high temperatures. Moreover, the result for\nthe first quantum corrections cannot, in general, be reproduced by modifying\nthe parameters of the classical theory.\n", "  We argue that a decrease of the chiral scalar meson mass is responsible for\nre-creation of $\\Psi'$ from $J/\\Psi$ in ultrarelativistic nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions. This causes the charmonium yields to freeze out at temperatures\nclose to the chiral symmetry restoration temperature $T_c$. As a result\n$\\Psi'/\\Psi$ may serve as a thermometer for $T_c$ itself. Results in a detailed\nreaction model support the conjecture. They show good agreement with recent\ndata of NA38 and NA50 for $J/\\Psi$ and $\\Psi'$ production in S on U and Pb on\nPb collisions.\n", "  We consider the interplay of a quark state and a hadronic threshold in the\nframework of the P-matrix formalism, which is reviewed and extended for use\ntogether with conventional methods of computing quark-gluon dynamics. We\nprovide a quantitative dynamical interpretation of the reduced R or K matrices\nand their poles that suggests a natural classification of threshold phenomena.\nAt a threshold with a quark state close to it up to three S-matrix poles can be\nfound. The scattering amplitudes for the corresponding cases are discussed. Our\nanalysis is applied to make an outlook for experimental observation of the\ndoubly strange H-dibaryon if it is not stable to strong decays.\n", "  Strongly coupled supersymmetric theories can give rise to composite quarks\nand leptons at low energy. We show that the internal structure of these\nparticles can explain the origin of three generations and provide a qualitative\nunderstanding of mass ratios and mixing angles between the different flavors of\nfermions, all within a renormalizable theory. The main point of the paper is to\nshow how fermion masses and mixing angles can result from a ``dual''\nFrogatt-Nielsen mechanism: fields neutral under $SU(3) \\times SU(2) \\times\nU(1)$ which carry flavor quantum numbers are confined within quarks and\nleptons, and from their perturbative interactions arises the observed flavor\nstructure.\n", "  Brooding over bosons, wave packets and Bose - Einstein correlations, we find\nthat a generalization of the pion-laser model for the case of overlapping\nwave-packets is analytically solvable with complete n-particle symmetrization.\nThe effective radius parameter of the two-particle correlation function is\nreduced for low values and enlargened for high values of the mean momentum in\nthe rare gas limiting case, as compared to the case when multi-particle\nsymmetrization effects are neglected.\n  These results explicitly depend on the multiplicity, providing a theoretical\nbasis for event-by-event analysis of high energy heavy ion reactions.\n", "  We employ nonperturbative flow equations to compute the equation of state for\ntwo flavor QCD within an effective quark meson model. This yields the\ntemperature and quark mass dependence of quantities like the chiral condensate\nor the pion mass. A precision estimate of the universal critical equation of\nstate for the three-dimensional O(4) Heisenberg model is presented. We\nexplicitly connect the O(4) universal behavior near the critical temperature\nand zero quark mass with the physics at zero temperature and a realistic pion\nmass. For realistic quark masses the pion correlation length near T_c turns out\nto be smaller than its zero temperature value.\n", "  We consider the structure of the leading ultra-violet (UV) renormalon\nsingularity associated with the QCD vacuum polarization Adler D-function, in\nthe approximation that only planar Feynman diagrams are retained. This ``planar\napproximation'' results in some simplifications, in particular three of the\nfour potential contributions from four-fermion operators are shown to be\nabsent. We are able to obtain a fully normalized result for the leading\n$n\\to\\infty$ behaviour of the portion of perturbative coefficients proportional\nto $N_f^{n-r} N^r$, for SU(N) QCD with $N_f$ quark flavours.\n", "  A comparison is made between the off-diagonal and helicity spin bases for top\nquark pair production at the FNAL Tevatron. In the off-diagonal basis, 92% of\nthe top quark pairs are in the spin configuration up-down plus down-up, whereas\nin the helicity basis only 70% are left-right plus right-left. The off-diagonal\nbasis maximizes the spin asymmetry and hence the measured angular correlations\nbetween the decay products, which are more than twice as big in this basis as\ncompared to the helicity basis. In addition, for the process q qbar --> t tbar,\nwe give a very simple analytic expression for the matrix element squared which\nincludes all spin correlations between the production and subsequent decay of\nthe top quarks.\n", "  I discuss the one jet inclusive jet cross section, d sigma /dE_T emphasizing\nthe concept of infrared safety and the cone definition of jets. Then I estimate\nthe size of power corrections to the jet cross section, which become important\nat smaller values of E_T.\n", "  We perform a covariant wave-packet analysis of neutrino oscillations taking\ninto account the lifetime of the neutrino production process . We find that\nflavor oscillations in space are washed out when the neutrinos are produced\nfrom long lived resonances - and what may be observed in\nappearance/disappearance experiments is a uniform conversion probability\nindependent of distance. The lifetime of the resonance which produces the\nneutrinos acts as the the effective baseline of the experiment.\n  For this reason the LSND experiment where neutrinos are produced from muon\ndecay has two orders of magnitude more sensitivity to neutrino mass square\ndifference than other experiments where the neutrinos are produced from pion or\nkaon decays.\n", "  In the heavy quark limit, the heavy baryon $\\Lambda_Q$ (Q=b or c) can be\nregarded as composed of a heavy quark and a scalar light diquark which has good\nspin and flavor quantum numbers. Based on this picture we establish the\nBethe-Salpeter (B-S) equation for $\\Lambda_Q$ in the leading order of $1/m_Q$\nexpansion. With the kernel containing both the scalar confinement and\none-gluon-exchange terms we solve the B-S equation numerically. The Isgur-Wise\nfunction for $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda_c$ is obtained numerically from our model.\nComparison with other model calculations are also presented. It seems that the\nIsgur-Wise function for $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda_c$ drops faster than that for $B\n\\to D$. The differential and total decay widths for $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda_c l\n\\bar{\\nu}$ are given in the limit $m_{b,c}\\to \\infty$.\n", "  Recently, Stech found form factor relations for heavy to light transitions\nbased on two simple dynamical assumptions for spectator partical. In this work\nwe generalize his approach to the case of baryons and find that for\n$\\Lambda_{Q}\\to\\Lambda$ ($Q=b$ or $c$) only one independent form factor remains\nin limit $m_{Q}\\to\\infty$. Furthermore, combining with the model of Guo and\nKroll we determine both of the two form factors for $\\Lambda_{Q}\\to\\Lambda$ in\nthe heavy quark limit. The results are applied to $\\Lambda_{b}\\to\\Lambda +\nJ/\\psi$ which is not clarified both theoretically and experimentally. It is\nfound that the branching ratio of $\\Lambda_{b}\\to\\Lambda + J/\\psi$ is of order\n10^{-5}.\n", "  We consider the first pion excitation as a sub-continuum resonance in the\npseudoscalar channel, and we obtain parameters characterizing this resonance\nthrough a global fit of the Borel-parameter dependence of the field-theoretical\npseudoscalar Laplace sum rule to its hadronic (pion + pion-excitation +\nQCD-continuum) content. Our analysis incorporates finite-width deviations from\nthe narrow resonance approximation, instanton effects, and higher-loop\nperturbative contributions to the pseudoscalar correlator. We obtain the\nfollowing values (uncertainties reflect 90% confidence levels): mass $M_\\Pi =\n1.15 \\pm 0.28 GeV$, width $\\Gamma_\\Pi = < 0.48 GeV$, decay constant $r \\equiv\n[F_\\Pi M_\\Pi^2 / f_\\pi m_\\pi^2]^2 = 4.7 \\pm 2.8$.\n", "  A new kind of classically stable static solitons called metastable\nquasi-topological defects (MQTD) and a systematic method to search for them is\npresented, with examples from realistic particle physics models. They are\ncharacterized by a topological winding number, which is not absolutely\nconserved so that the MQTD may be converted to radiation by quantum mecanical\ntunneling. The two-Higgs standard model (2HSM) supports the existence of\nclassically stable membranes for Higgs masses consistent with present day\nphenomenology and with perturbative unitarity, as well as with loop corrected\nMSSM. We also comment upon the possibility of metastable strings in the generic\n2HSM.\n", "  The definition of thermal relaxation time is extended to chemically\nnon-equilibrated quark-gluon plasma and the chemical non-equilibrated thermal\nrelaxation times for partons are calculated using the non-equilibrium Debye\nmass as the infrared regulator. The dependence of the thermal relaxation time\non the fugacity is given and the influence of the chemical non-equilibration is\ndiscussed. We find that there are threshold fugacities $\\lambda_g^*$ and\n$\\lambda_q^*$ for gluons and quarks. For \\lambda_g < \\lambda_g^* (\\lambda_q <\n\\lambda_q^*), \\tau_g^{NEQ}/\\tau_g^{EQ} (\\tau_q^{NEQ}/\\tau_q^{EQ}) decreases\nstrongly with increasing fugacity, while for $\\lambda_g > \\lambda_g^*\n(\\lambda_q>\\lambda_q^*$), the ratios are almost 1. It is shown that there is\nalso the two-stage equilibration in a chemically non-equilibrated plasma. We\nalso discussed the effect of using the non-equilibrium Deby mass as the\ninfrared cutoff.\n", "  The prospects for producing leptoquarks (LQs) in ultrahigh-energy (UHE)\nneutrino nucleon collisions are re-examined in the light of recent\ninterpretations of HERA data in terms of leptoquark production. We update\npredictions for cross-sections for the production of first- and\nsecond-generation leptoquarks in UHE nu-N and nubar-N collisions including\n  (i) recent experimental limits on masses and couplings from the LEP and\nTEVATRON colliders as well as rare processes,\n  (ii) modern parton distributions, and\n  (iii) radiative corrections to single leptoquark production.\n  If the HERA events are due to an SU(2) doublet leptoquark which couples\nmainly to (e+,q) states, we argue that there are likely other LQ states which\ncouple to neutrinos which are close in mass, due to constraints from precision\nelectroweak measurements.\n", "  We discuss a relation between the light-front quark model and QCD. We argue\nthat this model can be used for an evaluation of the light-cone wave functions\nfor moderate values of \"u\", but that it is inapplicable for this purpose in the\nregion near the ends points u=0,1. We find additional support for a recent\nanalysis in which it was claimed that the twist-two pion wave function attains\nits asymptotic form. The asymptotic twist-four two-particle wave function is\nalso in good agreement with the light-front quark model.\n", "  We use the BFKL equation to calculate the rate of deep inelastic scattering\nevents containing two forward jets (adjacent to the proton remnants) at HERA.\nWe compare the production of two forward jets with that of only one forward jet\n(the \"Mueller\" process). We obtain a stable prediction for this two to one jet\nratio, which may serve as a measure of the BFKL vertex function.\n", "  We study the contributions of the CP violating anomalous WW-gamma\ninteractions to b->s l^+ l^-. We obtain cutoff independent results on tilde\nkappa and tilde lambda, by constructing an asymmetry for the process\nB->K^*l^+l^-, where the B and B bar events are added. We show that a sample of\n10^4 B-> K^*e^+e^- events, can yield a bound\n  |tilde kappa| < 0.42 at 90% C.L., which is much tighter than the recent\nconstraint from D0.\n", "  The impact of the resummed next-to-leading logarithmic small-$x$\ncontributions to the anomalous dimension $\\gamma_{gg}$ is evaluated for the\nunpolarized parton densities and structure functions of the nucleon. These new\nterms diminish the gluon distribution and overcompensate the contribution\ncaused by the resummed leading logarithmic small-$x$ anomalous dimension and\nthe quarkonic anomalous dimensions beyond next-to-leading order.\n", "  We present a full characterization of the phase transition in U(1) scalar\nfield theory and of the associated vortex string thermodynamics in 3D. We show\nthat phase transitions in the string densities exist and measure their critical\nexponents, both for the long string and the short loops. Evidence for a natural\nseparation between these two string populations is presented. In particular our\nresults strongly indicate that an infinite string population will only exist\nabove the critical temperature. Canonical initial conditions for cosmic string\nevolution are show to correspond to the infinite temperature limit of the\ntheory.\n", "  In this talk I summarize recent work done in collaboration with Cliff Burgess\nand Denis Michaud, in which we performed a detailed investigation of how solar\nneutrinos propagate through helioseismic waves. We find that the MSW solar\nneutrino spectrum is not modified at all in the presence of seismic waves. This\nfinding differs from earlier estimates mainly because most helioseismic waves\nare too weak in the vicinity of the MSW resonance to be of relevance for\nneutrino propagation. A special class of waves may however by subject to an\ninstability and potentially have very large amplitudes. These waves do have\nlong wavelengths, a situation for which the formalism employed in earlier\nanalyses does not apply. Our numerical simulation significantly reduces their\ninfluence on neutrino propagation.\n", "  This paper has been withdrawn by the authors, due an incorrect treatment of\nthe effective Lagrangian, which led to the wrong conclusion on the\ndisappearance of physical theta dependence in gluodynamics. See hep-ph/9711398\nfor a correct procedure.\n", "  Pade approximants (PA's) are constructed from the perturbative coefficients\nof the free energy through O(g^5) in hot QCD. Pade summation is shown to reduce\nthe renormalization-scale dependence substantially even at temperature (T) as\nlow as 250 MeV.\n  Also, PA's predict that the free energy does not deviate more than 10 % from\nthe Stefan-Boltzmann limit for T > 250 MeV.\n", "  A relativistic equation is deduced for the bound state of two particles, by\nassuming a proper boundary condition for the propagation of the negative-energy\nstates. It reduces to the (one-body)Dirac equation in the infinite limit of one\nof the constituent mass. It also has the symmetries to assure the existence of\nthe anti-bound-state with the same mass. The interaction\nkernel(pseudo-potential) is systematically constructed by diagonalizing the\nHamiltonian of the background field theory, by which the retardation effects\nare included in the interaction. Its wave function at the origin(WFO) behaves\nproperly in a manner suggested by the covariant field theory.\n  The equation can well be applied in the heavy quark effective theory. It can\nalso be used as a starting equation for the unperturbed system in the rigorous\nperturbation theory of QED.\n", "  In supersymmetric theories with R-parity breaking, sleptons can be produced\nin quark-antiquark annihilation at the Tevatron through interactions in which\ntwo quark fields are coupled to a slepton field. If at the same time trilinear\nslepton-lepton-lepton couplings are present, the sleptons can be searched for\nas resonances in $p\\bar{p}\\to \\tilde{\\nu} \\to l^+l^-$ and $\\tilde{\\tau}\\to l\\nu\n$ final states. Existing Tevatron data can be exploited to derive bounds on the\nYukawa couplings of sleptons to quark and lepton pairs. Similar bounds can also\nbe obtained from $e^+e^-$ annihilation to hadrons at LEP2.\n", "  We clarify that one cannot distinguish between Majorana and Dirac neutrinos\nin the limit of vanishing neutrino mass. In particular we show, that the\nforward-backward asymmetry in the reaction e^+ e^- -> \\nu \\nu is the same for\n\\nu_M and \\nu_D, in contrast to recent claims made in the literature.\n", "  From sets and simple operations on sets, a Feynman Checkerboard physics model\nis constructed that allows computation of force strength constants and\nconstituent mass ratios of elementary particles, with a Lagrangian structure\nthat gives a Higgs scalar particle mass of about 146 GeV and a Higgs scalar\nfield vacuum expectation value of about 252 GeV, giving a tree level\nconstituent Truth Quark (top quark) mass of roughly 130 GeV, which is (in my\nopinion) supported by dileptonic events and some semileptonic events.

Numerical calculations are performed with the\nFortran program GENTLE v. 2.0 and its upgrade. Recent extensions include: (i)\nangular distribution for the CC11 process with LLA QED corrections; (ii)\nanomalous couplings. As an application we study the sensitivity of total\ncross-section and forward-backward asymmetry to anomalous couplings. A\nnoticeable sensitivity from the asymmetry appears only for a parity-violating\nanomalous coupling.\n", "  We compute several total and differential cross sections relevant to top,\n  WWZ and Higgs physics at future $e^+e^-$ colliders taking into account the\nfull set of Feynman diagrams for six fermion final states. We examine in\nparticular charged current processes, in which final particles cannot be formed\nby three Z's decay. We include in our calculations initial state radiation and\nbeamstrahlung effects, and the most important QCD corrections in an approximate\n(naive) form. We also compare this complete approach with production $\\times$\ndecay approximation.\n", "  We present an elegant exact formula for the gaugino $\\beta$-function in a\nsoftly-broken supersymmetric gauge theory, of the form $\\beta_M = {\\cal\nO}(\\beta_g/g)$, where $\\beta_g$ is the gauge $\\beta$ function and ${\\cal O}$ is\na simple differential operator acting on the gauge coupling $g$ and the Yukawa\ncoupling.\n", "  Contents:\n  1.

In most cases this\ndomain wall problem cannot be solved by explicit Z_{3} breaking without\nintroducing supergravity tadpole corrections which destabilize the weak scale\nhierarchy. Here we consider the possibility of solving the domain wall problem\nof the NMSSM via spontaneous discrete symmetry breaking occuring during\ninflation. For the case where the discrete symmetry breaking field has\nrenormalizible couplings to the NMSSM fields, we find that the couplings must\nbe less than 10^{-5} if the reheating temperature is larger than 10^{7}GeV, but\ncan be up to 10^{-3} for reheating temperatures of the order of the electroweak\nphase transition temperature. For the case of non-renormalizible couplings, we\npresent a model which can solve the domain wall problem for large reheating\ntemperatures without requiring any very small coupling constants.\n  In this model the domain walls are eliminated by a pressure coming from their\ninteraction with a coherently oscillating scalar field whose phase is fixed\nduring inflation.\n  This oscillating scalar field typically decays after the electroweak phase\ntransition but before nucleosynthesis, leaving no additional\n  Z_{3} symmetry breaking in the zero-temperature theory.\n", "  We present a measurement of the form-factor ratios r_V=V(0)/A_1(0) and\nr_2=A_2(0)/A_1(0) for the decay D^+ -> \\overline K^{*0} e^+ \\nu_e. The\nmeasurement is based on a signal of approximately 3000 $D^+ -> \\overline K^{*0}\ne^+ \\nu_e, \\overline K^{*0} -> K^-\\pi^+$ decays reconstructed in data from\ncharm hadroproduction experiment E791 at Fermilab.

Some phenomenological\nmaximal gluonium-quarkonium mixing shemes in the scalar sector are presented.\nThis talk is a compact version of the work in Ref.[1] (hep-ph/9612457) having\nthe same title.\n", "  The one-loop dispersion equation which defines the collective excitations of\nthe massive Dirac particles in hot and dense quark-gluon medium is obtained in\nthe high temperature limit for the case $m<<T$ and solved explicitly for all\n$|\\q|$ when $\\mu=0$. Four well-separated spectrum branches (quasi-particle and\nquasi-hole excitations) are found and their behaviors for the small and large\n$|\\q|$ are investigated. All calculations are performed using the temperature\nGreen function technique and fixing the Feynman gauge. The gauge dependency of\nthe spectra found are briefly discussed.\n", "  Spin observables may reveal much deeper properties of non perturbative\nhadronic physics than unpolarized quantities. We discuss here possible origins\nof single spin asymmetries in DIS, absent in the elementary lepton-quark\ninteractions, and suggest strategies to isolate and understand some non\nperturbative spin dependence of distribution and fragmentation functions. We\nalso discuss the polarization of hadrons produced in $e^+e^-$ annihilation at\nLEP and show how final state $\\qq$ interactions may give origin to non zero\nvalues of the off-diagonal element $\\rho_{1,-1}$ of the helicity density matrix\nof vector mesons: some predictions are given for $K^{*0}, \\phi$ and $D^*$ in\nagreement with recent OPAL data. Possible analogous effects in DIS and other\nprocesses are suggested.\n", "  Single top quark production at the Fermilab Tevatron Run II (a p \\bar{p}\ncollider with \\sqrt{S} = 2 TeV) proceeds dominantly via two sub-processes, a\nt-channel W-gluon fusion process, and an s-channel W^* process. We show that\nthese two sub-processes have different sensitivities to new physics effects in\nthe top quark's electro-weak interactions. The W^* process is sensitive to new\nheavy charged resonances, such as a W' boson, while the W-gluon fusion process\nis more sensitive to modifications to the top's interaction, including\nflavor-changing neutral currents involving the top quark. We examine the\nimplications of these results on our ability to measure V_{tb} with confidence,\nand propose a quantity R = \\sigma_{Wg} / \\sigma_{W^*}, which may be studied in\norder to characterize the confidence one may place upon a given measurement of\nV_{tb} from single top production.\n", "  A simple relativistic model is suggested that elucidates qualitatively the\nquark-antiquark distribution within virtual photon. The diffractive\nhadroproduction in DIS initiated by highly virtual photon $\\gamma ^{*}(Q^2)$ is\ndiscussed in more detail. The main result is that the contribution of large\ntransverse scale $q\\bar q$-fluctuations of the photon is just sufficient to\nproduce the cross section of its hadron-like strong interaction (in particular,\nits diffraction into hadrons) of the same $Q^2$-dependence as the total cross\nsection of $\\gamma ^{*}p$-interaction.

We find that qualitative structure of quark and lepton mass\nmatrices in this model describes very well the observation. We stress, in\nparticular, that the large mixing angle, $\\sin^22\\theta_{\\nu_\\mu\\nu_\\tau}\n\\simeq 1$, required for the atmospheric neutrino oscillation reported by the\nSuperKamiokande collaboration, is naturally obtained, which is a consequence of\nunparallel family structure in the present coset-space unification.\n", "  We construct a gauge mediation model of dynamical supersymmetry breaking\n(DSB) based on a vector-like gauge theory, in which there is a unique\ncolor-preserving true vacuum. The DSB scale $\\Lambda/4\\pi$ turns out to be as\nhigh as $\\Lambda/4\\pi \\simeq 10^{8-9} GeV$, since the transmission of the DSB\neffects to the standard model sector is completed through much higher loops.\nThis model is perfectly natural and phenomenologically consistent. We also\nstress that the dangerous D-term problem for the messenger U(1)_m is\nautomatically solved by a charge conjugation symmetry in the vector-like gauge\ntheory.\n", "  \\susy23 is a Monte-Carlo package for generating supersymmetric (SUSY)\nprocesses at $e^+e^-$ colliders. Twenty-three types of SUSY processes with 2 or\n3 final state particles at tree level are included in version 2.0. {\\susy23}\naddresses event simulation requirements at $e^+e^-$ colliders such as LEP.\nMatrix elements are generated by GRACE with the helicity amplitude method for\nprocesses involving massive fermions. The phase space integration of the matrix\nelement gives the total and differential cross sections, then unweighted events\nare generated. Sparticle widths and decay branching ratios are calculated. Each\nfinal state particle may then decay according to these probabilities. Spin\ncorrelations are taken into account in the decays of sparticles. Corrections of\ninitial state radiation (ISR) are implemented in two ways, one is based on the\nelectron structure function formalism and the second uses the parton shower\nalgorithm called QEDPS. Parton shower and hadronization of the final quarks are\nperformed through an interface to JETSET.\n", "  A new dynamical symmetry breaking of $SU(2)_{L}\\times U(1)$ caused by the\ncombination of the axial-vector component and the fermion mass is found in\nelectroweak theory. We obtain (m^{2}_{W}={1/2}g^{2}m^{2}_{t}) and\n(m^{2}_{Z}=\\rho m^{2}_{W}/cos^{2}\\theta_{W}) with (\\rho\\simeq 1), (G_{F}={1/2\n\\sqrt{2}m^{2}_{t}})}}). Two fixed gauge fixing terms for W and Z boson fields\nare dynamically generated. Massive neutrinos are required.\n", "  Beyond the standard model, a static potential between quark pairs is obtained\nphenomenologically (QCD inspired), associated with the range of strong\ninteraction, when the virtual exchange gluon squared momentum transfer has a\nperiodicity for periodic boundary conditions of the quark-pair system enclosed\nby a constant volume, in the lowest order of the effective perturbed QCD (in\nwhich the gluon propagator is replaced by the effective gluon one). This\npotential includes a periodicity dependent effect, characterized by a finite\nface value of the periodicity $N$, in addition to the periodicity independent\npotential (the Coulomb type plus linear one). That periodicity dependent\neffect, dominant at short distance, is applied to an explanation of the top\nquark mass $$m_t=8\\pi m_\\pi N^{{1/2}},$$ whose numerically calculated results\nindicate approximately both upper and lower bounds of $m_t$\n  $$177~\\mbox{{GeV}} > m_t > 173 ~\\mbox{{GeV}}$$ for the range of strong\ninteraction $L=1.40~fm~(=m_\\pi^{-1})$.\n", "  We present a composite model of quarks with `effective supersymmetry'. The\nmodel is based on the gauge group $(SU(2)_S \\times SU(2)_M) \\times (SU(2)_U\n\\times SU(2)_C \\times SU(2)_T) \\times SU(5)_{SM}$, where $SU(5)_{SM}$ is the\nstandard model gauge group. In the dynamical supersymmetry breaking sector\nbased on the gauge group $SU(2)_S \\times SU(2)_M$, supersymmetry is dynamically\nbroken. The preon sector is constructed by the model proposed by Nelson and\nStrassler. The fermion mass hierarchy among the up-type quarks originates from\nthe $SU(2)_U \\times SU(2)_C \\times SU(2)_T$ gauge dynamics. The supersymmetry\nbreaking is mediated to the minimal supersymmetric standard model sector by the\n`preon' superfields which compose the quarks in the first two generations. To\nobtain an experimentally acceptable mass spectrum, the scalar quarks in the\nfirst two generations need masses of order 10 TeV, while the other\nsuperpartners need masses less than 1 TeV. Therefore, the mass spectrum in our\nmodel is one example of the `effective supersymmetry' model proposed by Cohen,\nKaplan and Nelson.\n", "  We present a new mechanism for $B^{\\pm}\\to \\eta' K^{\\pm}$, and analyze it\nstrictly within perturbative QCD. We find that such a new mechanism may\ndominate non-leptonic $B$-decays to light mesons. Within a reasonable parameter\nspace, our prediction is in good agreement with the recent CLEO data on\n$B^{\\pm}\\to \\eta' K^{\\pm}$. We conclude that there is no room for an abnormally\nlarge \\bsg vertex from physics beyond the Standard Model.\n", "  Propagation of gamma-quanta in the single crystals, oriented in a region of\nthe coherent pair production is considered. The qualitative description of the\nprocess is also discussed. The theory of gamma-quanta propagation in the\nanisotropic medium is illustrated by the help of the particular calculations of\nsuch a process in silicon single crystals.\n  It is shown that the single crystals are sensitive to the initial circular\npolarization of gamma-beam despite the fact that the cross section of\nabsorption is independent of it. The reason is that the normal electromagnetic\nwaves (an eigenfunctions of the problem) are elliptically polarized. The speeds\nof absorption and motion of both the normal waves are different and as a result\nthe process of gamma-quanta propagation depend on the initial polarization\nstate. The calculated value of asymmetry is about 20% for 25 GeV gamma-quanta\npropagating in 100 cm silicon single crystal.\n  The obtained results are useful in creating of polarimeters for high energy\nelectrons and gamma-quanta.\n", "  A S-wave \\pi\\pi resonance below 1 GeV/c^2, sigma has been observed in\nanalyses of the phase shift data of \\pi\\pi scatterings. It is important to\nobserve it in production processes. A huge events of \\pi^0\\pi^0 below 1 GeV/c^2\nis seen in the central production of the GAMS experiment. Its mass spectrum is\nwell described by the variant mass and width method (VMW) including f_0(980),\nf_2(1270) and a S-wave resonance which might be assigned to be a sigma. We\nreport here that the angular distributions of the \\pi^0\\pi^0 system are also\ndescribed with the S-wave resonance interfering with f_0(980) and the tail of\nf_2(1270) by VMW. The same method is applied to the \\pi^+\\pi^- data of J/\\psi\n\\to \\omega\\pi\\pi decay, and is shown that not only \\pi^+\\pi^- mass spectrum but\nalso its cos\\theta_\\pi distributions are described well.\n", "  The scalar-isoscalar pi-pi phase shifts are calculated in the pi-pi energy\nrange from 600 MeV to 1600 MeV. We use results of the CERN-Cracow-Munich\ncollaboration for the reaction pi^- p --> pi^+ pi^- n on a transversely\npolarized target at 17.2 GeV/c pi^- momentum. Energy-independent separation of\nthe S-wave pseudoscalar amplitude (pi exchange) from the pseudovector amplitude\n(a_1 exchange) is carried out. Below the KK threshold we find two solutions for\nthe pi-pi phase shifts, for which the phases increase slower with the effective\npi-pi mass than the P-wave phases (\"flat\" solutions) and two solutions for\nwhich the phases increase faster than the P-wave phases (\"steep\" solutions).\nAbove 1420 MeV both sets of phase shifts increase with energy faster than in\nthe experiment on an unpolarized target. This fact can be related to a presence\nof the scalar resonance f_0(1500).\n", "  We investigate the non-equilibrium properties of an N-component scalar field\ntheory. The time evolution of the correlation functions for an arbitrary\nensemble of initial conditions is described by an exact functional differential\nequation. In leading order in the 1/N expansion the system can be understood in\nterms of infinitely many conserved quantities. They forbid the approach to the\ncanonical thermal distribution. Beyond leading order only energy conservation\nis apparent generically. Nevertheless, we find a large manifold of stationary\ndistributions both for classical and quantum fields. They are the fixed points\nof the evolution equation. For small deviations of the correlation functions\nfrom a large range of fixed points we observe stable oscillations. These\nresults raise the question of if and in what sense the particular fixed point\ncorresponding to thermal equilibrium dominates the large time behavior of the\nsystem.\n", "  We analyzed the solar, terrestrial and atmospheric neutrinos experiments\nusing the three-flavor neutrino framework and got the allowed regions for\nparameters (\\Delta m_{12}^2, \\sin^22\\theta_{12}, \\Delta m_{23}^2, \\theta_{13},\n\\theta_{23}). In solar neutrino experiments, we got the large angle solution\n(\\Delta m_{12}^2, \\sin^22\\theta_{12})=(4x10^{-6}\n  - 7x10^{-5}eV^2, 0.6 - 0.9) and small angle solution (3x10^{-6} -\n1.2x10^{-5}eV^2, 0.003 - 0.01) for \\theta_{13}=0^\\circ - 20^\\circ. From the\nterrestrial and atmospheric neutrino experiments, we got the allowed regions\n(\\theta_{13}<4^\\circ, 24^\\circ<\\theta_{23}<26^\\circ) for \\Delta m_{23}^2=2eV^2,\n(\\theta_{13}<4^\\circ, 24^\\circ<\\theta_{23} <45^\\circ) for \\Delta\nm_{23}^2=0.2eV^2 and (\\theta_{13}<14^\\circ, \\theta_{23}=40^\\circ) for \\Delta\nm_{23}^2=0.02eV^2. It seems that the large angle solution for (\\Delta m_{12}^2,\n\\sin^22\\theta_{12}) is favored than the small angle slution from the analysis\nof zenith angle dependence in atmospheric neutrino sub-GeV experiment.\n", "  We calculate the chiral odd quark distributions and the corresponding\nstructure functions $h_T(x,Q^2)$ and $h_L(x,Q^2)$ within the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio\nchiral soliton model for the nucleon. The $Q^2$ evolution of the twist-2\ncontributions is performed according to the standard GLAP formalism while the\ntwist-three piece, $\\bar{h}_L(x)$, is evolved according to the large $N_C$\nscheme. We carry out a comparison between the chiral odd structure functions of\nthe proton and the neutron. At the low model scale ($Q_0^2$) we find that the\nleading twist effective quark distributions,$f_1^{(q)}(x,Q_0^2)$,\n$g_1^{(q)}(x,Q_0^2)$ and $h_T^{(q)}(x,Q_0^2)$ satisfy Soffer's inequality for\nboth quark flavors $q=u,d$.\n", "  We consider arbitrary splits of field operators into two parts, and use the\ncorresponding definition of normal ordering introduced by Evans and Steer. In\nthis case the normal ordered products and contractions have none of the special\nsymmetry properties assumed in existing proofs of Wick's theorem. Despite this,\nwe prove that Wick's theorem still holds in its usual form as long as the\ncontraction is a c-number. Wick's theorem is thus shown to be much more general\nthan existing derivations suggest, and we discuss possible simplifying\napplications of this result.\n", "  In terms of multiple scattering picture, I compute the nuclear dependence in\nDrell-Yan transverse momentum distribution, $d\\sigma / dQ^2 dq_T^2$, in\nhadron-nucleus collisions. I present the results for large $q_T$ region and\ndiscuss the possible suppression in small $q_T$ region.\n", "  We have calculated inclusive direct CP-asymmetries for charmless B^{+/-}\n-decays. After summing large logarithms to all orders the CP-asymmetries in\nDelta S=0 and Delta S=1 decays are found as\n  a_{CP} (Delta S=0) = (2.0 +1.2/-1.0)%\n  and\n  a_{CP} (Delta S=1) = ( -1.0 +/- 0.5)%.\n  These results are much larger than previous estimates based on a work without\nsummation of large logarithms. We further show that the dominant contribution\nto a_{CP} (\\Delta S=0 ) is proportional to (sin gamma) times |V_{cb}/V_{ub}|.\nThe constraints on the apex (rho-bar,eta-bar) of the unitarity triangle\nobtained from these two CP-asymmetries define circles in the\n(rho-bar,eta-bar)-plane. We have likewise analyzed the information on the\nunitarity triangle obtainable from a measurement of the average non-leptonic\nbranching ratios Br(Delta S=0), Br(Delta S=1) and their sum Br_{NL} (B --> no\ncharm). These CP-conserving quantities define circles centered on the\nrho-bar--axis of the (rho-bar,eta-bar)-plane. We expect a determination of\n|V_{ub}/V_{cb}| from Br_{NL} (B --> no charm) to be promising. Our results\ncontain some new QCD corrections enhancing Br(Delta S=1), which now exceeds\nBr(Delta S=0) by roughly a factor of two.\n", "  We examine whether parameters related to Higgs sector of the minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model can be determined by detailed study of production\ncross section and decay branching ratios of the Higgs boson.\n  Assuming that only the light Higgs boson is observed at a future $e^+e^-$\nlinear collider with $\\sqrt{s}=300\\sim500$GeV, we show that values of\n$m_{susy}$ and $\\tan\\beta$ are restricted within a narrow limits in the\n$m_{susy}$ versus $\\tan\\beta$ plane by the combined analysis of the light Higgs\nproperties.\n  It is also pointed out that, in some case, the value of $\\tb$ may be\nrestricted within a relatively low value, $\\tb=1\\sim5$.\n", "  We have carried out Monte Carlo calculations on two sets of randomly\ngenerated QCD events due to $p\\bar{p} \\to t \\bar{t}$ with top mass $m_t = 170$\nGeV, one set leading to $e^+e^-$ or $e^{\\pm}\\mu^{\\mp}$ or $\\mu^+\\mu^-$ 2jets\n(dilepton) and the other leading to $e^{\\pm}$ or $\\mu^{\\pm}$ 4jets (unilepton)\nconfigurations, in order to test the likelihood methods we have proposed for\ndetermining the top mass by analyses of these two sets of configurations. For\nthe set of unilepton events, our method gives a very efficient and quite sharp\nmeasure of the top mass lying several GeV below the input mass. For the\ndilepton set, our method gives a much broader and markedly asymmetric\ndistribution for the top mass estimates, 75% of them lying below 170 GeV, but\nthe dilepton data will have much lower background than unilepton data. We then\nillustrate these methods by applying them to the data available from CDF in\n1995 and discuss the results obtained in relation to the results for the sets\nof Monte Carlo events. The dilepton events yield masses spread widely, over 140\nto 180 GeV, generally lower than the unilepton events, which cluster around\n$175\\pm 8$ GeV. In an appendix, we discuss the nature of the additional\n``slow'' $\\mu^{+}$ observed in one CDF dilepton event, concluding that it is\nmost probably a ``tertiary lepton'' resulting from the decay sequence $b\\to c +\nhadrons$, followed by $c\\to s \\mu^{+} \\nu$.\n", "  A simple Regge pole model for $K\\pi$ scattering explains the large $e^{i\n\\delta}$ between isospin amplitudes which is observed at the D meson mass\n($\\delta \\approx \\pi/2$). It predicts $\\delta \\approx 14^{\\circ}- 20^{\\circ}$\nat the B mass. Implications for ($B \\to K \\pi$) decays and extensions of the\nmodel to other two-body decay channels are briefly discussed.\n", "  If next generations of heavy quarks and leptons exist within the standard\nmodel (SM), they can manifest themselves in Higgs boson production at the\nTevatron and the LHC, before being actually observed. This generation leads to\nan increase of the Higgs boson production cross section via gluon fusion at\nhadron colliders by a factor 6-9. So, the study of this process at the Tevatron\nand LHC can finally fix the number of generations in the SM. Using the $WW^*$\nHiggs boson decay channel, the studies at the upgraded Tevatron will answer the\nquestion about the next generation for mass values 135 GeV $\\lsim M_H\\lsim 190$\nGeV. Studying the $\\tau\\bar{\\tau}$ channel we show its large potential for the\nstudy of the Higgs boson at the LHC even in the standard case of three\ngenerations. At the Tevatron, studies in this channel could explore the mass\nrange 110-140 GeV.\n", "  Following Dyson's analogy between the quantum field theory and the\n19th-century chemistry-both explain how but not why-one could also establish an\nanalogy between atomic physics and string theory. Atomic physics was needed to\nanswer the question why in chemistry, string theory is trying to answer the\nquestion why in the standard model. This attempt is very briefly reviewed in\nthis talk. After discussing the phenomenological aspects of string theory, the\nstudy of soft terms is emphasized as a possible connection between theory and\nexperiment. Special attention is paid to the issues of flavor changing neutral\ncurrents, loop effects, charge and color breaking minima, and M-theory versus\nweakly coupled string theory.\n", "  The dependence of the semileptonic kaon decay form factors on the 4-momentum\ntransfer to the lepton pair causes certain changes in the differential decay\nrates and, hence, it should affect the conventional atmospheric neutrino flux\nand neutrino flavour ratio. As a case in point, we included these rates into\nthe calculation of the atmospheric neutrino flux at energies 1 to 100 TeV.\n  The calculated neutrino spectra are between the earlier predictions while the\nneutrino flavor ratio, R, is somewhat affected by the kaon form factors. The R\nproves to be very sensitive to the contribution of neutrinos from decay of\ncharmed particles, providing an additional method to test the charm production\nmodels in future experiments with large-volume neutrino telescopes.\n", "  Contents: 1. Introduction. 2. Sum rules prior to QCD. 3. Dispersion\nrelations. 4. Types of two point function sum rules. 5. Non-perturbative power\ncorrections.\n  6. Some examples of QCD sum rules.\n", "  We consider thermal QCD in the large N_C limit, mainly in 1+1 dimensions.\n  The gauge coupling is only taken into account to minimal order, by projection\nonto colour singlets. An expression for the free energy, exact as N_C goes to\ninfinity, is then obtained. A third order phase transition will occur. The\ncritical temperature depends on the ratio N_C/L, where L is the (infinite)\nspatial length. In the high temperature limit, the free energy will approach\nthe same value as in the free theory, whereas we have a mesonic like phase at\nlow temperature. Expressions for the quark condensate, <\\bar\\Psi \\Psi >, are\nalso obtained.\n", "  Using the results of a high precision calculation of the solar neutrino\nsurvival probability for Earth crossing neutrinos in the case of MSW $\\nu_e -->\n\\nu_s$ transition solution of the solar neutrino problem, we derive predictions\nfor the one-year averaged day-night (D-N) asymmetries in the deformed\nrecoil-$e^-$ spectrum and in the energy-integrated event rate due to the solar\nneutrinos, to be measured with the Super - Kamiokande detector. The asymmetries\nare calculated for three event samples, produced by solar $\\nu_e$ crossing the\nEarth mantle only, the core, and the mantle only + the core (the full night\nsample). The effects of the uncertainties in the value of the bulk matter\ndensity and in the chemical composition of the Earth core on the predictions\nfor the D-N asymmetries are investigated. The dependence of the D - N effect\nrelated observables on the threshold recoil - e- kinetic energy, TeTh, is\nstudied. It is shown, in particular, that for $\\sin^2 2\\theta_V \\leq 0.030$ the\none year average D-N - asymmetry in the sample of events due to the\ncore-crossing neutrinos is larger than the asymmetry in the full night sample\ntypically by a factor $\\sim (2 - 4)$. We find, however, that at small mixing\nangles $\\sin^2 2 \\theta_V \\ltap 0.014$, the D-N asymmetry in the case of solar\n$\\nu_e --> \\nu_s$ transitions is considerably smaller than if the transitions\nwere into an active neutrino, $\\nu_e --> \\nu_{\\mu(\\tau)}$. In particular, a\nprecision better than 1% in the measurement of any of the three one year\naveraged D-N asymmetries considered by us would be required to test the small\nmixing angle nonadiabatic $\\nu_e --> \\nu_s$ solution at $\\sin^2 2\\theta_V\n~\\ltap ~0.01$.\n", "  For central collisions Xe(50 A.MeV)+Sn we compared experimental data from the\nINDRA detector with QMD simulations. Theory as well as experiment show a clear\nbinary character of the fragment emission even for very central collisions.\nFrom the time evolution of the reaction (QMD simulation) we could built up a\nscenario for the dynamical emission of fragments\n", "  We generalize the concept of conserving, Phi-derivable, approximations to\nrelativistic field theories. Treating the interaction field as a dynamical\ndegree of freedom, we derive the thermodynamic potential in terms of fully\ndressed propagators, an approach which allows us to resolve the entropy of a\nrelativistic plasma into contributions from its interacting elementary\nexcitations. We illustrate the derivation for a hot relativistic system\ngoverned by electromagnetic interactions.\n", "  The processes involving $K^{-}p, KN, \\Sigma\\pi, \\Lambda\\pi,\\Sigma\\eta,\n  \\Lambda\\eta$ coupled channels are studied in the nonperturbative chiral\napproach.\n  An effective potential is constructed using a chiral meson-baryon Lagrangian\nat lowest order. This potential is iterated to all orders with the\nLippmann-Schwinger equation.\n  A reasonable fit of the experimental data is obtained.\n  It is pointed out, however, that due to a strong sensitivity of the results\nto the value of the cut-off, such an approach should be viewed as a rather\nphenomenological way to fit the experimental data since there is no small\nexpansion parameter allowing for truncation of the chiral expansion of the\neffective potential at some given order. A possible way to construct the\nconsistent chiral expansion is briefly discussed\n", "  We discuss the isospin-breaking mass differences among baryons, with\nparticular attention in the charm sector to the $\\Sigma_c^{+}-\\Sigma_c^0$,\n$\\Sigma_c^{++}-\\Sigma_c^0$, and $\\Xi_c^+-\\Xi_c^0$ splittings. Simple potential\nmodels cannot accommodate the trend of the available data on charmed baryons.\nMore precise measurements would offer the possibility of testing how well\npotential models describe the non-perturbative limit of QCD.\n", "  We consider supersymmetry breaking in theories with gaugino condensation in\nthe presence of an anomalous U(1) symmetry with anomaly cancellation by the\nGreen-Schwarz mechanism. In these models, a Fayet-Iliopoulos D-term can give\nimportant contributions to the soft supersymmetry-breaking scalar masses. Most\ndiscussions of this possibility have ignored the dilaton field. We argue that\nthis is not appropriate in general, and show that the F-term contributions to\nthe soft breaking terms are comparable to or much larger than the D-term\ncontributions, depending on how the dilaton is stabilized. We discuss\nphenomenological implications of these results.\n", "  We consider, in the electroweak standard model context, several left-right\nasymmetries in $\\mu e$ elastic scattering at fixed target and collider\nexperiments. For the former case, we show that the muon mass effects are\nimportant in a wide energy range. We also show that these asymmetries are\nsensitive to the electroweak mixing angle $\\theta_W$. The effect of an extra\n$Z'$ neutral vector boson appearing in a 331 model is also considered. The\ncapabilities of these asymmetries in the search of this extra $Z'$ are\naddressed.\n", "  By employing retarded and advanced propagators, Aurenche and Becherrawy\nshowed how to rewrite the real-time thermal Feynman rules so that the\ntemperature dependence is removed from the free propagators and transferred to\nthe vertices. The present paper introduces retarded and advanced field\noperators and incorporates all temperature dependence into the interaction term\nof the Hamiltonian. Perturbative expansions of the Green functions in the\nHamiltonian formulation give the correct results order by order in perturbation\ntheory.\n  The spectrum of the temperature-dependent Hamiltonian contains the thermal\nquasiparticles that produce poles in the propagators.\n", "  If the magnetic moment of unstable tau neutrinos with the mass of $O$(MeV) is\nin the region of $10^{-8}\\mu_{B} \\lesssim \\mu_{\\nu_{\\tau}} \\lesssim\n10^{-6}\\mu_{B}$, it is compatible with the present experimental and\ncosmological bounds.\n  It is pointed out here, that if the tau neutrino has such a large magnetic\nmoment and can oscillate into a neutrino of another flavour the results from\n$\\nu e$ scattering experiment at LAMPF constrain the tau neutrino mixing angles\nto $sin^{2}2\\theta_{e \\tau} \\lesssim 2\\times 10^{-6} - 2\\times 10^{-2}$ and\n$sin^{2}2\\theta_{\\mu\\tau} \\lesssim 10^{-6} - 10^{-2}$ depending on the magnetic\nmoment value in the allowed region.\n", "  We split the Yang-Mills Lagrangian into a free and an interaction part in\nsuch a way, that the free part is non-local and contains an arbitrary form\nfactor.\n  Manifest gauge invariance is guaranteed by connecting the field-strength\ntensors at different space-time points by a string. As a result the gluon\npropagator, which, due to the presence of the string, now contains many\ndifferent contributions, comes out strictly transversal in one-loop order.\n  We also calculate the ghost self-energy and the ghost-gluon vertex in\none-loop order. Subsequently we discuss how one can determine the \"optimal\"\nform of the form factor. To apply well known principles like \"fastest apparent\nconvergence\" or \"principle of minimal sensitivity\" one has first to solve some\nproblems connected with divergences and renormalization. Here we concentrate on\nthe calculation of the anomalous dimensions and the beta-function. This is\ntechnically simpler because only the divergent contributions of the integrals\nhave to be determined. The beta-function becomes independent of the gauge\nparameter as it should. A puzzle with respect to the principle of minimal\nsensitivity shows up. Really interesting non-perturbative results are expected\nwhen applying the above principles directly to the propagator. For the\nbeta-function a two loop calculation would be required to obtain non-trivial\nresults.\n", "  We point out that a background torsion field will produce an effective\npotential to the $K$ and $\\bar{K}$ with opposite signs. This allows us to\nconstrain the background torsion field from the $K_L$ and $K_S$ mass\ndifference, CPT violating $K^\\circ$ and $\\bar{K^\\circ}$ mass difference and the\nCP violating quantities $\\epsilon$ and $\\eta_{+-}$. The most stringent bound on\nthe cosmological background torsion $< T^0 > < 10^{-25}$ GeV comes from the\ndirect measurement of the CPT violation.\n", "  It has recently shown that in supersymmetric left-right models with automatic\nR-parity conservation, the theory below the $W_R$ scale is given by MSSM with\nmassive neutrinos and a pair of doubly charged superfields with masses in the\n100 GeV range (with or without an extra pair of heavy Higgs doublets (M \\geq 10\nTeV) depending on the model). In this paper we study the unification prospects\nfor such theories and their phenomenological implications for collider\nexperiments. We study two versions of the theory, one with supersymmetry\nbreaking transmitted via the gauge and another where the same occurs via\ngravitational forces. We point out that looking at multi $\\tau$ final states\ncan considerably constrain the parameter space of the model.\n", "  We study the flux-tube solution in the dual Ginzburg-Landau (DGL) theory and\napply it to the understanding of quark-gluon-plasma (QGP) formation in the\nultra-relativistic heavy ion collision as the multi-flux-tube system. It is\nconcluded that the annihilation process of two flux-tubes can contribute to the\nQGP formation with the energy deposition $\\sim 4 GeV/fm^3$. Furthermore, we\nstudy the glueball as the flux-tube ring by combining the DGL theory with the\nstring theory, and find the mass and the size as $\\sim 1.2 GeV$ and $\\sim 0.22\nfm$, respectively.\n", "  Multi-pion correlations effect on three-pion interferometry is studied. It is\nshown that multi-pion correlations decrease both the apparent radius of the\nsource and the coherent source parameter derived from three-pion\ninterferometry. The data of OPAL group are discussed.\n", "  Multi-pion correlations and wavepacket size effects on the pion multiplicity\ndistribution, pion momentum distribution and two-pion interferometry are\nstudied. It is shown that multi-pion Bose-Einstein correlations and the\nwavepacket size cause an abundance of pions at low momentum, increase the mean\npion multiplicity and decrease both the apparent radius of the source and the\ncoherent source parameter derived from two-pion interferometry.\n", "  The relevance of the dipole configurations of quarks in forming nucleus\nstructure functions is discussed. It is shown that a radiation generated by\ndipole configurations while moving relativistically along their axises is\ndescribed by distributions which are finite and infrared stable in low\ntransverse momentum region. It is argued that there is an exponential\ntransition to the perturbative regime of large transverse momenta and its power\nis defined by the distance between the dipole charges in its rest frame\n$m^{-1}_\\pi$.\n", "  Taking into account the quadratic in mass terms in the effective chiral\nlagrangian, we show that, at \\theta \\sim \\pi, the theory with 2 light quarks of\nequal mass involves two degenerate vacuum states separated by a barrier. For\nthree flavors, the energy barrier between two vacua appears already in the\nleading order in mass. This corresponds to the first order phase transition at\n\\theta = \\pi. The surface energy density of the domain wall separating two\ndifferent vacua is calculated. In the immediate vicinity of the phase\ntransition point, two minima of the potential still exist, but one of them\nbecomes metastable. The probability of the false vacuum decay is estimated.\n", "  We discuss some important issues concerning multiplicities in quark and gluon\njets in e+e- annihilation. In QCD the properties of a jet in general depend on\ntwo scales, the energy and virtuality of the jet. Frequently theoretical\npredictions apply to a situation where these scales coincide, while for\nexperimental data they are often different. Thus an analysis to extract e.g.\nthe asymptotic multiplicity ratio CF/CA between quark and gluon jets, needs a\ncarefully specified jet definition, together with a calculation of nonleading\ncorrections to the multiplicity evolution.\n  We propose methods to systematically study the separate dependence upon the\ntwo scales in experimental data and compare the results with theory. We present\njet finding algorithms which corresponds well to the theoretically considered\njets. We also show that recoil effects add corrections to the modified leading\nlog approximation which are quantitatively important, though formally\nsuppressed at high energies.\n", "  Angular structure of radiative and collisional energy losses of a hard parton\njet propagating through dense QCD-matter is investigated. For small angular jet\ncone sizes, $\\theta_0 < 5^0$, the radiative energy loss is shown to dominate\nover the collisional energy loss due to final state elastic rescattering of the\nhard projectile on thermal particles in the medium. Due to coherent effects,\nthe radiative energy loss decreases with increasing the angular size the jet.\nIt becomes comparable with the collisional energy loss for $\\theta_0 >\n5^0-10^0$.\n", "  In this paper we present a dynamical model of SUSY breaking with a hybrid\nmessenger sector. SUSY is broken dynamically at a scale of order $10^9$ GeV via\nstrong SU(2) gauge interactions. SUSY breaking is then transmitted to the\nobservable sector via two distinct sources: (1) messengers, carrying Standard\nModel gauge quantum numbers, with the messenger mass of order\n  $10^{15}$ GeV, and (2) the D term of an anomalous U(1)$_X$. The model is\nquite constrained. The messenger scale is fixed by the Fayet-Iliopoulos term\nfor the anomalous U(1)$_X$ interaction. In addition, we show that the D term\nSUSY breaking contributions to squark and slepton masses are \"naturally\" the\nsame order as those coming from the messengers.\n", "  New type of pion interferometry formulas is derived, in which not only the\ncorrelator but also the pion multiplicity is taken consideration.\n  The method to get information about initial emission probability of the\nunsymmetrized Bosons is given.\n", "  We consider the time evolution of systems in which a spatially homogeneous\nscalar field is coupled to fermions. The quantum back-reaction is taken into\naccount in one-loop approximation. We set up the basic equations and their\nrenormalization in a form suitable for numerical computations. The initial\nsingularities appearing in the renormalized equations are removed by a\nBogoliubov transformation. The equations are then generalized to those in a\nspatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe.\n  We have implemented the Minkowski space equations numerically and present\nresults for the time evolution with various parameter sets. We find that\nfermion fluctuations are not in general as ineffective as assumed previously\nbut show interesting features which should be studied further. In an especially\ninteresting example we find that fermionic fluctuations can ``catalyze'' the\nevolution of bosonic fluctuations.\n", "  We propose a modified Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov equation from the\nviewpoint of the resummation technique, which contains an intrinsic dependence\non momentum transfer Q, and satisfies the unitarity bound. The idea is to relax\nthe strong rapidity ordering and to restrict phase space for real gluon\nemissions in the evaluation of the BFKL kernel. It is shown that the power-law\nrise of the gluon distribution function with the small Bjorken variable x turns\ninto a logarithmic rise, and that the predictions for the proton structure\nfunction $F_2(x,Q^2)$ are consistent with the HERA data.\n", "  We present a new, simple supersymmetry breaking model with direct gauge\nmediation. Supersymmetry breaking sector is based on the model with an Affine\nquantum moduli space. The model has no gauge messengers and no light scalars\ncharged under the Standard Model which give a negative contribution to the soft\nmasses. Large expectation value at the minimum is obtained by balancing the\nrunaway potential and the dimension six nonrenormalizable term. This makes it\neasy to preserve the perturbative unification. Enough suppression of the\nsupergravity contribution to the soft masses can also be shown.\n", "  We review the recent developments of virtual Compton scattering. We focus on\nthe kinematical regimes which look the most promising. The threshold regime\ngives access to the generalized polarizabilities of the proton. The hard\nscattering regime allows tests of perturbative QCD predictions and of the\nvalence quark wave function. The Bjorken regime is closely related to deep\ninelastic scattering. It gives access to the off-forward parton distributions\nwhich generalize the ordinary parton distributions and may shed a new light on\nthe spin problem. For each regime we discuss the experimental perspectives and\nthe role of the Bethe-Heitler background.\n", "  We discuss the conditions under which pre-big bang models can fit the\nobserved large-scale anisotropy with a primordial spectrum of massive\n(Kalb--Ramond) axion fluctuations.\n  The primordial spectrum must be sufficiently flat at low frequency and\nsufficiently steeper at high frequency. For a steep and/or long enough\nhigh-frequency branch of the spectrum the bounds imposed by COBE's\nnormalization allow axion masses of the typical order for a\nPeccei--Quinn--Weinberg--Wilczek axion. We provide a particular example in\nwhich an appropriate axion spectrum is obtained from a class of backgrounds\nsatisfying the low-energy string cosmology equations.\n", "  In the framework of semihard QCD approach, with the emphasis on the BFKL\nevolution of gluon distributions, we calculate the differential cross sections\nof inclusive $D^{*\\pm}$ mesons electroproduction at HERA and confront our\nresults with available\n  ZEUS experimental data.\n", "  We study chiral vorton production for Witten-type superconducting string\nmodels in the context of a recently developed analytic formalism. We delineate\nthree distinct scenarios: First, a low energy regime (including the electroweak\nscale) where vortons can be a source of dark matter. Secondly, an intermediate\nenergy regime where the vorton density is too high to be compatible with the\nstandard cosmology (thereby excluding these models). Finally, a high energy\nregime (including the GUT scale) in which no vortons are expected to form. The\nvorton density is most sensitive to the order of the string-forming phase\ntransition and relatively insensitive to the current-forming transition. For a\nsecond-order string transition, vorton production is cosmologically disastrous\nfor the range $10^{-28}\\lsim G\\mu \\lsim 10^{-10}$ ($10^{5} GeV \\lsim T_{c}\n\\lsim 10^{14} GeV$), while for the first-order case we can only exclude\n$10^{-20}\\lsim G\\mu \\lsim 10^{-14}$ ($10^{9} GeV \\lsim T_{c} \\lsim 10^{12}\nGeV$). We provide a fitting formula which summarises our results.\n", "  We construct an effective three dimensional theory for the MSSM at high\ntemperatures in the limit of large-$m_{A}$. We analyse the two-loop effective\npotential of the 3D theory for the case of a light right handed stop to\ndetermine the precise region in the $m_{h}$-$m_{\\tilde{t}_{R}}$ plane for which\nthe sphaleron constraint for preservation of the baryon asymmetry is satisfied.\nWe also compare with results previously obtained usind 3D and 4D calculations\nof the effective potential. A two-stage phase transition still persists for a\nsmall range of values of $m_{\\tilde{t}_{R}}$. The allowed region requires a\nvalue of $m_{\\tilde{t}_{R}} \\lsi m_{t}$ and $m_{h} \\lsi 100$ (110) GeV for\n$m_{Q} = 300$ GeV (1 TeV).\n", "  Electromagnetic and weak current operators for interacting systems should\nproperly commute with the Poincar\\'e generators and satisfy Hermiticity. The\nelectromagnetic current should also satisfy ${\\cal P}$ and ${\\cal T}$\ncovariance and continuity equation. We show that in front-form dynamics the\ncurrent can be constructed from auxiliary operators, defined in a Breit frame\nwhere initial and final three-momenta of the system are directed along the\n  $z$ axis. Poincar\\'e covariance constraints reduce for auxiliary operators to\nthe ones imposed only by kinematical rotations around the $z$ axis; while\nHermiticity requires a suitable behaviour of the auxiliary operators under\nrotations by $\\pi$ around the $x$ or $y$ axes. Applications to deep inelastic\nstructure functions and electromagnetic form factors are discussed. Elastic and\ntransition form factors can be extracted without any ambiguity and in the\nelastic case the continuity equation is automatically satisfied, once\nPoincar\\'e, ${\\cal P}$ and ${\\cal T}$ covariance, together with Hermiticity,\nare imposed.\n", "  The L/E-flatness of the e-like events observed in the recent\natmospheric-neutrino data from Super-Kamiokande (SuperK) is interpreted to\nreflect a new symmetry of the neutrino-oscillation mixing matrix. From that we\nobtain an analytical set of constraints yielding a class of mixing matrices of\nthe property to simultaneously fit both the SuperK and the LSND data. The\nresulting mass squared difference relevant for the LSND experiment is found as\n0.3 eV^2. The discussed symmetry, e.g., carries the nature that expectation\nvalues of masses for \\nu_\\mu and \\nu_\\tau are identical. These considerations\nare purely data dictated. A different framework is then applied to the solar\nneutrino problem. It is argued that a single sterile neutrino is an unlikely\ncandidate to accommodate the data from the four solar neutrino experiments. A\nscenario is discussed which violates CPT symmetry, and favors the \\nu_e -\n\\bar\\nu_e system to belong to the `self'-`anti-self' charge conjugate construct\nin the (1/2,0)+(0,1/2) representation space, where the needed helicity flipping\namplitudes are preferred, rather than the usual Dirac, or Majorana, constructs.\nIn the presented framework the emerging SuperK data on solar neutrino flux is\nreconciled with the Homestake, GALLEX, and SAGE experiments. This happens\nbecause the former detects not only the solar \\nu_e but also, at a lower cross\nsection, the oscillated solar \\bar\\nu_e; while the latter are sensitive only to\nthe oscillation-diminished solar \\nu_e flux. A direct observation of solar\n\\bar\\nu_e by SNO will confirm our scenario. Finally, we consider the\npossibility for flavor-dependent gravitational couplings of neutrinos as\nemerging out of the noncommutativity of the quantum operators associated with\nthe measurements of energy and flavor.\n", "  The implications of a negligible annihilation contribution in $B \\to D K$\ndecays are reanalyzed and are shown to lead to no new constraints on the weak\nphase $\\gamma$ from color-allowed $B^{\\pm} \\to D K^{\\pm}$ decays. A test of\nnegligible annihilation is proposed in $B^+ \\to D^+ K^0$ (or $B^+ \\to D^+\nK^{*0}$), and an application is presented in which $\\gamma$ can be determined\nfrom these processes (or corresponding $B \\to D K^*$ decays) supplemented with\nisospin-related neutral $B$ decays.\n", "  An Aoki-Denner form of the renormalization scheme is suggested for the\nphysical amplitudes in MSSM. The Higgs sector is reparameterized with the mass\nof the CP odd scalar, and the mass of the heavy CP even one instead of\n$tan\\beta$ in our scheme. The counterterms of $tan\\beta$ is fixed\nperturbatively on mass shell just within\n  Higgs sector. The counterterms of gauge-scalar mixings are defined with\nWard-Takahashi identit ies from scalar-scalar mixings. The effect of the\nreparameterization is also probed on the radiative correction of the mass of\nthe lightest Higgs.\n", "  Theoretical and phenomenological arguments are in favor of an elusive new\nneutral vector boson Z' with a relatively low mass, chiral couplings to\nordinary quarks and whose couplings to ordinary leptons are suppressed\n(leptophobia). We point out that this new particle could induce some parity\nviolating spin asymmetries which could be measured soon at the Brookhaven\nRelativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), running part of the time as a polarized\nhadronic collider.\n", "  We show that the study of certain observables in the angular distribution in\n$B\\to J/\\psi K^*$ provide clear test for CP vioaltion beyond the Standard\nModel. These observables vanish in SM, but in models beyond SM some of them can\nbe large enough to be measured at B factories.\n", "  A new rigorous light-cone path integral approach to the\nLandau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect in QED and QCD is discussed. The rate of\nphoton (gluon) radiation by an electron (quark) in a medium is expressed\nthrough the Green's function of a two-dimensional Schrodinger equation with an\nimaginary potential. In QED this potential is proportional to the dipole cross\nsection for scattering of e+e- pair off an atom, in QCD it is proportional to\nthe cross section of interaction of the color singlet quark-antiquark-gluon\nsystem with a medium constituent. In QED our predictions agree well with the\nphoton spectrum measured recently at SLAC for 25 GeV electrons. In QCD for a\nsufficiently energetic quark produced inside a medium we predict the radiative\nenergy loss proportional L^{2}, where L is the distance passed by the quark in\nthe medium. It has a weak dependence on the initial quark energy. The L^{2}\ndependence transforms into L^{1} as the quark energy decreases. We also give\nnew formulas for nuclear shadowing in hard reactions.\n"]}
