[1], we have discussed optimal ambiguous discrimination in\nqubit systems. We have analyzed the problem of the optimal discrimination of N\nknown quantum states and have obtained maximum success probability and optimal\nmeasurement for N known quantum states with equiprobable prior probabilities\nand equidistant from center of the Bloch ball, not all of which are on the one\nhalf of the Bloch ball and all of the conjugate states are pure. An exact\nsolution has also been given for arbitrary three known quantum states. The\ngiven examples which use our method include: 1. Diagonal N mixed states; 2. N\nequiprobable states and equidistant from center of the Bloch ball which their\ncorresponding Bloch vectors are inclined at the equal angle from z axis; 3.\nThree mirror-symmetric states; 4. States that have been prepared with equal\nprior probabilities on vertices of a Platonic solid.\n  Keywords: minimum-error discrimination, success probability, measurement,\nPOVM elements, Helstrom family of ensembles, convex optimization, conjugate\nstates PACS Nos: 03.67.Hk, 03.65.Ta\n", "  A simple model system is introduced for demonstrating how a single photon\nsource might be used to transduce classical analog information. The theoretical\nscheme results in measurements of analog source samples that are (i) quantized\nin the sense of analog-to-digital conversion and (ii) corrupted by random noise\nthat is solely due to the quantum uncertainty in detecting the polarization\nstate of each photon. This noise is unavoidable if more than one bit per sample\nis to be transmitted, and we show how it may be exploited in a manner inspired\nby suprathreshold stochastic resonance. The system is analyzed information\ntheoretically, as it can be modeled as a noisy optical communication channel,\nalthough unlike classical Poisson channels, the detector's photon statistics\nare binomial. Previous results on binomial channels are adapted to demonstrate\nnumerically that the classical information capacity, and thus the accuracy of\nthe transduction, increases logarithmically with the square root of the number\nof photons, N. Although the capacity is shown to be reduced when an additional\ndetector nonideality is present, the logarithmic increase with N remains.\n", "  Consider two independent random strings having same length and taking values\nuniformly in a common finite alphabet. We study the order of the variance of\nthe length of the longest common subsequences (LCS) of these strings when long\nblocks, or other types of atypical substrings, are sparsely added into one of\nthem. Under weak conditions on the derivative of the mean LCS-curve, the order\nof the variance of the LCS is shown to be linear in the length of the strings.\nWe also argue that our proofs carry over to many models used by computational\nbiologists to simulate DNA-sequences. This is the first result where the open\nquestion of the order of the fluctuation of the LCS of random strings is solved\nfor a realistic model. Until now, this type of result had only been established\nfor low entropy cases.\n", "  Arguments are gived for the plausibility that quantum mechanics is a\nstochastic theory and that many quantum phenomena derive from the existence of\na real noise consisting of vacuum fluctuations of all fundamental fields\nexisting in nature. Planck's constant appears as the parameter fixing the scale\nof the fluctuations. Hints for an intuitive explanation are offered for some\ntypical quantum features, like the uncertainty principle or the particle\nbehaviour of fields. It is proposed that the recent discovery of dark energy in\nthe universe is an argument for the reality of the vacuum fluctuations. A study\nis made of the compatibility of the model with the results of performed tests\nof Bell\\'{}s inequalities.\n", "  Remarkable progress of quantum information theory (QIT) allowed to formulate\nmathematical theorems for conditions that data-transmitting or data-processing\noccurs with a non-negative entropy gain. However, relation of these results\nformulated in terms of entropy gain in quantum channels to temporal evolution\nof real physical systems is not thoroughly understood. Here we build on the\nmathematical formalism provided by QIT to formulate the quantum H-theorem in\nterms of physical observables. We discuss the manifestation of the second law\nof thermodynamics in quantum physics and uncover special situations where the\nsecond law can be violated. We further demonstrate that the typical evolution\nof energy-isolated quantum systems occurs with non-diminishing entropy.\n", "  We investigate the effect of the inertial and non-inertial segments of\nrelativistic motion on the quantum Fisher information of (1+1) Dirac field\nmodes confined to cavities. %For this purpose, a bipartite system comprising of\nAlice's and Rob's cavities with appropriate boundary conditions is prepared.\nFor the purpose, we consider the situation that Rob's cavity, initially\ninertial, accelerates uniformly with respect to its proper time and then again\nbecomes inertial while Alice's cavity remains inertial. The acceleration is\nassumed to be very small and its effects were analyzed in a perturbative\nregime. For analysis, we consider $\\theta$ parameterized two-qubit pure\nentangled state and a Werner state. In contrast to the degradation of\nentanglement due to the relativistic motion between the cavities, the quantum\nFisher information of the pure composite system $\\mathcal{F}_\\theta$ with\nrespect to parameter $\\theta$ is found to be invariant under the same\nconditions. However, in the case of the Werner state, the quantum Fisher\ninformation displays periodic degradation, due to the inertial and non-inertial\nsegments of motion. Further, we investigate how this evolution process affects\nthe quantum Fisher information distribution over the subsystems of Alice's and\nRob's cavities. We find that the quantum Fisher information over the Rob's\ncavity shows the periodic degradation behavior depending upon the parameter\n$\\theta$ as well as the uniform acceleration for both the two qubit pure state\nand Werner state. The quantum Fisher information over Alice's cavity remains\ninvariant throughout the motion of Rob's cavity for the two qubit pure state\nwhereas for Werner state it is affected by the mixing parameter of the Werner\nstate.\n", "  We present an autonomous phase-plane describing the evolution of field\nequations containing an agegraphic dark energy in 5D Brans- Dicke cosmology. To\nobservationally verify the numerical results, we simultaneously solve the\nequations by constraining the model parameters with SNe Ia data. We find\nconditions for the existence and stability of the critical points (states of\nthe universe) and numerically examine the cosmological parameters. We also\ninvestigate the model by means of statefinder diagnostic.\n", "  A classical spin model derived ab initio for rare-earth-based permanent\nmagnet compounds is presented. Our target compound, NdFe$_{12}$N, is a material\nthat goes beyond today's champion magnet compound Nd$_{2}$Fe$_{14}$B in its\nintrinsic magnetic properties with a simpler crystal structure. Calculated\ntemperature dependence of the magnetization and the anisotropy field agree with\nthe latest experimental results in the leading order. Having put the realistic\nobservables under our numerical control, we propose that engineering\n$5d$-electron-mediated indirect exchange coupling between $4f$-electrons in Nd\nand $3d$-electrons from Fe would most critically help to enhance the material's\nutility over the operation-temperature range.\n", "  The advantage of Pauli-Villars regularization in quantum field theory\nquantized on the light front is explained. Simple examples of scalar\n$\\lambda\\varphi^4$ field theory and Yukawa-type model are used. We give also an\nexample of nonperturbative calculation in the theory with Pauli-Villars fields,\nusing for that a model of anharmonic oscillator modified by inclusion of ghost\nvariables playing the role similar to Pauli-Villars fields.\n", "  The renormalization problem of (2+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills theory quantized\non the light front is considered. Extra fields analogous to those used in\nPauli-Villars regularization are introduced to restore perturbative equivalence\nbetween such quantized theory and conventional formulation in Lorentz\ncoordinates. These fields also provide necessary ultraviolet regularization to\nthe theory. Obtained results allow to construct renormalized Hamiltonian of the\ntheory on the light front.\n", "  The baryon-strangeness correlation in the hadronization of the quark matter\nis studied within the quark combination mechanism. We calculate the correlation\ncoefficient $C_{BS} = -3\\big(\\langle B S \\rangle -\\langle B\\rangle \\langle\nS\\rangle\\big)/\\big( \\langle S^2 \\rangle-\\langle S \\rangle^2 \\big)$ of initial\nhadrons produced from the deconfined free quark system with $C^{(q)}_{BS}=1$.\nThe competition of the production of baryons against that of mesons is the key\ndynamics that is most relevant to the change of baryon-strangeness correlation\nduring system hadronization. Results of quark combination under the Poisson\nstatistics agree with the statistical model predictions for a hadron resonance\ngas at vanishing chemical potential but differ from those at relatively large\nchemical potentials. Results beyond Poisson statistics are also obtained and\nare compared with calculations of Lattice QCD in the phase boundary, giving the\nbest agreement at temperature $T =163$ MeV. We predict the dependence of the\n$C_{BS}$ of hadron system on the baryon chemical potential and strangeness.\nThese predictions are expected to be tested by the future Lattice QCD\ncalculations at non-zero chemical potentials and/or by the Beam Energy Scan\nexperiment of STAR Collaboration at RHIC.\n", "  We investigate the superconducting phase diagram and boundary modes for a\nquasi-1D system formed by three Fe-Chains on an s-wave superconductor,\nmotivated by the recent Princeton experiment. The $\\vec l\\cdot\\vec s$ onsite\nspin-orbit term, inter-chain diagonal hopping couplings, and magnetic disorders\nin the Fe-chains are shown to be crucial for the superconducting phases, which\ncan be topologically trivial or nontrivial in different parameter regimes. For\nthe topological regime a single Majorana and multiple Andreew bound modes are\nobtained in the ends of the chain, while for the trivial phase only low-energy\nAndreev bound states survive. Nontrivial symmetry reduction mechanism induced\nby the $\\vec l\\cdot\\vec s$ term, diagonal hopping couplings, and magnetic\ndisorder is uncovered to interpret the present results. Our study also implies\nthat the zero-bias peak observed in the recent experiment may or may not\nreflect the Majorana zero modes in the end of the Fe-chains.\n", "  The available results from the inelastic neutron scattering experiment\nperformed on the quasi-two dimensional spin $\\frac{1}{2}$ anti-ferromagnetic\nmaterial $La_2 Cu O_4$ have been analysed theoretically. The formalism of ours\nis based on a semi-classical like treatment involving a model of an ideal gas\nof mobile vortices and anti-vortices built on the background of the\nN$\\acute{e}$el state, using the bipartite classical spin configuration\ncorresponding to an XY- anisotropic Heisenberg anti-ferromagnet on a square\nlattice. The results for the integrated intensities for our spin $\\frac{1}{2}$\nmodel corresponding to different temperatures, show occurrence of vigorous\nunphysical oscillations, when convoluted with a realistic spectral window\nfunction. These results indicate failure of the conventional semi-classical\ntheoretical model of ideal vortex/anti-vortex gas arising in the\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless theory for the low spin magnetic systems. A\nfull fledged quantum mechanical formalism and calculations seem crucial for the\nunderstanding of topological excitations in such low spin systems. Furthermore,\na severe disagreement is found to occur at finite values of energy transfer\nbetween the integrated intensities obtained theoretically from the conventional\nformalism and those obtained experimentally. This further suggests strongly\nthat the full quantum treatment should also incorporate the interaction between\nthe fragile-magnons and the topological excitations. This is quite plausible in\nview of the recent work establishing such a process in XXZ quantum ferromagnet\non 2D lattice. The high spin XXZ quasi-two dimensional antiferromagnet like\n$MnPS_3$ however follows the conventional theory quite well\n", "  Scaling relations between black hole (BH) masses and their host galaxy\nproperties have been studied extensively over the last two decades, and point\ntowards co-evolution of central massive BHs and their hosts. However, these\nrelations remain poorly constrained for BH masses below $\\sim10^{6}$ M_sun.\nHere we present optical and X-ray observations of the dwarf galaxy RGG 118\ntaken with the Magellan Echellette Spectrograph on the 6.5m Clay Telescope and\nChandra X-ray Observatory. Based on Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy, RGG\n118 was identified as possessing narrow emission line ratios indicative of\nphotoionization partly due to an active galactic nucleus. Our higher resolution\nspectroscopy clearly reveals broad H$\\alpha$ emission in the spectrum of RGG\n118. Using virial BH mass estimate techniques, we calculate a BH mass of\n$\\sim50,000$ \\msun. We detect a nuclear X-ray point source in RGG 118,\nsuggesting a total accretion powered luminosity of $L=4\\times10^{40}~{\\rm\nerg~s^{-1}}$, and an Eddington fraction of $\\sim1$ per cent. The BH in RGG 118\nis the smallest ever reported in a galaxy nucleus and we find that it lies on\nthe extrapolation of the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma_{\\ast}$ relation to the lowest\nmasses yet.\n", "  We examine by extensive computer simulations the self-diffusion of\nanisotropic star like particles in crowded two-dimensional solutions. We\ninvestigate the implications of the area coverage fraction $\\phi$ of the\ncrowders and the crowder-crowder adhesion properties on the regime of transient\nanomalous diffusion. We systematically compute the mean squared displacement\n(MSD) of the particles, their time averaged MSD, as well as the effective\ndiffusion coefficient. The diffusion appears ergodic in the limit of long\ntraces, such that the time averaged MSD converges towards the ensemble averaged\nMSD and features a small residual amplitude spread of the time averaged MSD\nfrom individual trajectories. At intermediate time scales we quantify the\nanomalous diffusion in the system. Also, we show that the translational---but\nnot rotational---diffusivity of the particles $D$ is a non-monotonic function\nof the attraction strength between them. Both diffusion coefficients decrease\nas $D(\\phi)\\sim (1-\\phi/\\phi^*)^2$ with the area fraction $\\phi$ occupied by\nthe crowders. Our results might be applicable to rationalising the experimental\nobservations of non-Brownian diffusion for a number of standard macromolecular\ncrowders used in vitro to mimic the cytoplasmic conditions of living cells.\n", "  We study the dynamics of polymer chains in a bath of self-propelled particles\n(SPP) by extensive Langevin dynamics simulations in a two dimensional system.\nSpecifically, we analyse the polymer looping properties versus the SPP activity\nand investigate how the presence of the active particles alters the chain\nconformational statistics. We find that SPPs tend to extend flexible polymer\nchains while they rather compactify stiffer semiflexible polymers, in agreement\nwith previous results. Here we show that larger activities of SPPs yield a\nhigher effective temperature of the bath and thus facilitate looping kinetics\nof a passive polymer chain. We explicitly compute the looping probability and\nlooping time in a wide range of the model parameters. We also analyse the\nmotion of a monomeric tracer particle and the polymer's centre of mass in the\npresence of the active particles in terms of the time averaged mean squared\ndisplacement, revealing a giant diffusivity enhancement for the polymer chain\nvia SPP pooling. Our results are applicable to rationalising the dimensions and\nlooping kinetics of biopolymers at constantly fluctuating and often actively\ndriven conditions inside biological cells or suspensions of active colloidal\nparticles or bacteria cells.\n", "  NbP is one member of a new class of nodal loop semimetals characterized by\nthe cooperative effects of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and a lack of inversion\ncenter. Here transport and spectroscopic properties of NbP are evaluated using\ndensity functional theory methods. SOC together with the lack of inversion\nsymmetry splits degeneracies, giving rise to \"Russian doll nested\" Fermi\nsurfaces containing 4*10$^{-4}$ electron (hole) carriers/f.u. Due to the modest\nSOC strength in Nb, the Fermi surfaces map out the Weyl nodal loops. Calculated\nstructure around T$^*$~100 K in transport properties reproduces well the\nobserved transport behavior only when SOC is included, attesting to the\nprecision of the (delicate) calculations and the stoichiometry of the samples.\nLow energy collective electron-hole excitations (plasmons) in the 20-60 meV\nrange result from the nodal loop splitting.\n", "  For $\\delta$ Scuti star CoRoT 102749568, 52 independent frequencies were\nobtained by Papar$\\acute{o}$ et al. 2013. We find that there are 4 multiplets\nand 8 doublets with nearly equal split caused by rotation. Differential\nrotation is suggested instead of rigid body rotation to explain the equal split\nphenomenon. Grids of models are computed with MESA to fit observational\nfrequencies of CoRoT 102749568. After rejecting modes of $m\\neq0$ in multiplets\nand doublets, we identify 31 modes of $m = 0$ and 3 modes of $m\\neq0$,\nincluding 4 modes of $l = 0$, 9 modes of $l=1$, 11 modes of $l=2$, and 10 modes\nof $l=3$. The mean error is 0.447$\\mu$Hz for the best-fitting model, and the\nphysical parameters of the corresponding model are as followings: $M=1.95$ $\\rm\nM_{\\odot}$, $Z=0.025$, $T_{\\rm eff}=7096$ K, log$g=3.727$, $L=22.77$ $\\rm\nL_{\\odot}$, $Age=1.113$ Gyr.\n", "  Let $\\mathfrak P$ be the Lie algebra of Hamiltonian vector fields on the\ntorus, which is also known as the Virasoro-like algebra, a special kind of the\nso-called Block type Lie algebra. And let $\\mathfrak A$ be the Laurent\npolynomial algebra in two variables. In this paper, by following S.E. Rao's\nstrategy of \"backward induction\", we prove that any quasi-finite simple\n$(\\mathfrak A,\\mathfrak P)$-module has to come from Larsson-Shen's\nconstruction.\n", "  We calculate fermionic response in domain wall backgrounds of\nfour-dimensional gauged supergravity interpolating between distinct stable AdS\nvacua. The backgrounds, found by Bobev et al., are holographically dual to\nzero-temperature states of ABJM theory at finite density for monopole charge\nand are similar to zero-temperature limits of holographic superconductors, but\nwith a symmetry-breaking source as well. The condensed scalar mixes charged and\nneutral fields dual to composite fermionic operators in the Dirac equations.\nBoth gapped and gapless bands of stable quasiparticles are found.\n", "  An important class of physical systems that are of interest in practice are\ninput-output open quantum systems that can be described by quantum stochastic\ndifferential equations and defined on an infinite-dimensional underlying\nHilbert space. Most commonly, these systems involve coupling to a quantum\nharmonic oscillator as a system component. This paper is concerned with error\nbounds in the finite-dimensional approximations of input-output open quantum\nsystems defined on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. We develop a\nframework for developing error bounds between the time evolution of the state\nof a class of infinite-dimensional quantum systems and its approximation on a\nfinite-dimensional subspace of the original, when both are initialized in the\nlatter subspace. This framework is then applied to two approaches for obtaining\nfinite-dimensional approximations: subspace truncation and adiabatic\nelimination. Applications of the bounds to some physical examples drawn from\nthe literature are provided to illustrate our results.\n", "  Condensation phenomena in particle systems typically occur as one of two\ndistinct types: either as a spontaneous symmetry breaking in a homogeneous\nsystem, in which particle interactions enforce condensation in a randomly\nlocated site, or as an explicit symmetry breaking in a system with background\ndisorder, in which particles condensate in the site of extremal disorder. In\nthis paper we confirm a recent conjecture by Godr\\`eche and Luck by showing,\nfor a zero range process with weak site disorder, that there exists a phase\nwhere condensation occurs with an intermediate type of symmetry-breaking, in\nwhich particles condensate in a site randomly chosen from a range of sites\nfavoured by disorder. We show that this type of condensation is characterised\nby the occurrence of a Gamma distribution in the law of the disorder at the\ncondensation site. We further investigate fluctuations of the condensate size\nand confirm a phase diagram, again conjectured by Godr\\`eche and Luck, showing\nthe existence of phases with normal and anomalous fluctuations.\n", "  Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) offers a window to view nanoscale\nproperties and processes. When performed in a scanning transmission electron\nmicroscope, EELS can simultaneously render images of nanoscale objects with\nsub-nanometer spatial resolution and correlate them with spectroscopic\ninformation of $\\sim10 - 100$ meV spectral resolution. Consequently, EELS is a\nnear-perfect tool for understanding the optical and electronic properties of\nindividual and few-particle plasmonic metal nanoparticles assemblies, which are\nsignificant in a wide range of fields. This review presents an overview of\nbasic plasmonics and EELS theory and highlights several recent noteworthy\nexperiments involving the electron-beam interrogation of plasmonic metal\nnanoparticle systems.\n", "  The first passage is a generic concept for quantifying when a random quantity\nsuch as the position of a diffusing molecule or the value of a stock crosses a\npreset threshold (target) for the first time. The last decade saw an\nenlightening series of new results focusing mostly on the so-called mean and\nglobal first passage time (MFPT and GFPT, respectively) of such processes. Here\nwe push the understanding of first passage processes a step further. For a\nsimple heterogeneous system we derive rigorously the complete distribution of\nfirst passage times (FPTs). Our results demonstrate that the typical FPT\nsignificantly differs from the MFPT, which corresponds to the long time\nbehaviour of the FPT distribution. Conversely, the short time behaviour is\nshown to correspond to trajectories connecting directly from the initial value\nto the target. Remarkably, we reveal a previously overlooked third\ncharacteristic time scale of the first passage dynamics mirroring brief\nexcursion away from the target.\n", "  We have analyzed stellar properties of the relativistic mean-field (RMF)\nparametrizations shown to be consistent with the recently studied constraints\nrelated to nuclear matter, pure neutron matter, symmetry energy and its\nderivatives [Dutra et al., Phys. Rev. C 90, 055203 (2014)]. Our results show\nthat only two RMF parametrizations do not allow the emergence of the direct\nUrca process, important aspect regarding the evolution of a neutron star.\nMoreover, among all approved RMF models, fourteen of them produce neutron stars\nwith maximum masses inside the range $1.93\\leqslant M/M_\\odot\\leqslant 2.05$,\nwith $M_\\odot$ being the solar mass. Only three models yield maximum masses\nabove this range and a discussion on the inclusion of hyperons is presented.\nFinally, we have verified that the models satisfying the neutron star maximum\nmass constraint do not observe the squared sound velocity bound, namely, $v_s^2\n< 1/3$, corroborating recent findings. However, the recently proposed\n$\\sigma$-cut scheme can make the RMF models consistent with both constraints\ndepending on the isoscalar-vector interaction of each parametrization.\n", "  The world's leading directional dark matter experiments currently all utilize\nlow-pressure gas Time Projection Chamber (TPC) technologies. We discuss some of\nthe challenges for this technology, for which balancing the goal of achieving\nthe best sensitivity with that of cost effective scale-up requires optimization\nover a large parameter space. Critical for this are the precision measurements\nof the fundamental properties of both electron and nuclear recoil tracks down\nto the lowest detectable energies. Such measurements are necessary to provide a\nbenchmark for background discrimination and directional sensitivity that could\nbe used for future optimization studies for directional dark matter\nexperiments. In this paper we describe a small, high resolution, high signal-\nto-noise GEM-based TPC with a 2D CCD readout designed for this goal. The\nperformance of the detector was characterized using alpha particles, X-rays,\ngamma-rays, and neutrons, enabling detailed measurements of electron and\nnuclear recoil tracks. Stable effective gas gains of greater than $1 \\times\n10^5$ were obtained in 100 Torr of pure CF$_4$ by a cascade of three standard\nCERN GEMs each with a 140 $\\mu$m pitch. The high signal-to-noise and\nsub-millimeter spatial resolution of the GEM amplification and CCD readout,\ntogether with low diffusion, allow for excellent background discrimination\nbetween electron and nuclear recoils down below $\\sim$10 keVee ($\\sim$23 keVr\nfluorine recoil). Even lower thresholds, necessary for the detection of low\nmass WIMPs for example, might be achieved by lowering the pressure and\nutilizing full 3D track reconstruction. These and other paths for improvements\nare discussed, as are possible fundamental limitations imposed by the physics\nof energy loss.\n", "  We study noncoplanar magnetic ordering in frustrated itinerant magnets. For a\nfamily of Kondo square lattice models with classical local moments, we find\nthat a double-$Q$ noncoplanar vortex crystal has lower energy than the\nsingle-$Q$ helical order expected from the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida\ninteraction whenever the lattice symmetry dictates four global maxima in the\nbare magnetic susceptibility. By expanding in the small Kondo exchange and the\ndegree of noncoplanarity, we demonstrate that this noncoplanar state arises\nfrom a Fermi surface instability, and it is generic for a wide range of\nelectron filling fractions whenever the two ordering wave vectors connect\nindependent sections of the Fermi surface.\n", "  We calculate the Debye mass of massless \\phi^4-theory to order g^6 at weak\ncoupling. The contributions to the Debye mass arise from the hard momentum\nscale of order T and the soft momentum scale of order gT. Effective field\ntheory methods and dimensional reduction are used to separate the contributions\nfrom the two momentum scales. The hard contribution can be calculated as a\npower series in g^2 using naive perturbation theory with bare propagators. The\nsoft contribution is calculated using an effective theory in three dimensions,\nwhose coefficients are power series in g^2. This contribution is a power series\nin g starting at order g^3. The calculation of the hard part to order g^6. The\ncalculation of the soft part requires calculating the mass parameter in the\neffective theory to order g^6 and the evaluation of four-loop self-energy\ndiagrams in three dimensions. This gives the Debye mass correct up to order\ng^6. We discuss the convergence of the perturbative series as well as the loop\nexpansion in three dimensions which implies a selective resummation of\nhigher-order terms.\n", "  The growing sluggishness of glass-forming liquids is thought to be\naccompanied by growing structural order. The nature of such order, however,\nremains hotly debated. A decade ago, point-to-set (PTS) correlation lengths\nwere proposed as measures of amorphous order in glass formers, but recent\nresults raise doubts as to their generality. Here, we extend the definition of\nPTS correlations to agnostically capture any type of growing order in liquids,\nbe it local or amorphous. This advance enables the formulation of a clear\ndistinction between slowing down due to conventional critical ordering and that\ndue to glassiness, and provides a unified framework to assess the relative\nimportance of specific local order and generic amorphous order in glass\nformation.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a qubit-resonator system, when the resonator is\ndriven by two signals. The interaction of the qubit with the high-amplitude\ndriving we consider in terms of the qubit dressed states. Interaction of the\ndressed qubit with the second probing signal can essentially change the\namplitude of this signal. We calculate the transmission amplitude of the probe\nsignal through the resonator as a function of the qubit's energy and the\ndriving frequency detuning. The regions of increase and attenuation of the\ntransmitted signal are calculated and demonstrated graphically. We present the\ninfluence of the signal parameters on the value of the amplification, and\ndiscuss the values of the qubit-resonator system parameters for an optimal\namplification and attenuation of the weak probe signal.\n", "  Noise through its interaction with the nonlinearity of the living systems can\ngive rise to counter-intuitive phenomena. In this paper we shortly review noise\ninduced effects in different ecosystems, in which two populations compete for\nthe same resources. We also present new results on spatial patterns of two\npopulations, while modeling real distributions of anchovies and sardines. The\ntransient dynamics of these ecosystems are analyzed through generalized\nLotka-Volterra equations in the presence of multiplicative noise, which models\nthe interaction between the species and the environment. We find noise induced\nphenomena such as quasi-deterministic oscillations, stochastic resonance, noise\ndelayed extinction, and noise induced pattern formation. In addition, our\ntheoretical results are validated with experimental findings. Specifically the\nresults, obtained by a coupled map lattice model, well reproduce the spatial\ndistributions of anchovies and sardines, observed in a marine ecosystem.\nMoreover, the experimental dynamical behavior of two competing bacterial\npopulations in a meat product and the probability distribution at long times of\none of them are well reproduced by a stochastic microbial predictive model.\n", "  The critical 2d classical Ising model on the square lattice has two\ntopological conformal defects: the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry defect\n$D_{\\epsilon}$ and the Kramers-Wannier duality defect $D_{\\sigma}$. These two\ndefects implement antiperiodic boundary conditions and a more exotic form of\ntwisted boundary conditions, respectively. On the torus, the partition function\n$Z_{D}$ of the critical Ising model in the presence of a topological conformal\ndefect $D$ is expressed in terms of the scaling dimensions $\\Delta_{\\alpha}$\nand conformal spins $s_{\\alpha}$ of a distinct set of primary fields (and their\ndescendants, or conformal towers) of the Ising CFT. This characteristic\nconformal data $\\{\\Delta_{\\alpha}, s_{\\alpha}\\}_{D}$ can be extracted from the\neigenvalue spectrum of a transfer matrix $M_{D}$ for the partition function\n$Z_D$. In this paper we investigate the use of tensor network techniques to\nboth represent and coarse-grain the partition functions $Z_{D_\\epsilon}$ and\n$Z_{D_\\sigma}$ of the critical Ising model with either a symmetry defect\n$D_{\\epsilon}$ or a duality defect $D_{\\sigma}$. We also explain how to\ncoarse-grain the corresponding transfer matrices $M_{D_\\epsilon}$ and\n$M_{D_\\sigma}$, from which we can extract accurate numerical estimates of\n$\\{\\Delta_{\\alpha}, s_{\\alpha}\\}_{D_{\\epsilon}}$ and $\\{\\Delta_{\\alpha},\ns_{\\alpha}\\}_{D_{\\sigma}}$. Two key new ingredients of our approach are (i)\ncoarse-graining of the defect $D$, which applies to any (i.e. not just\ntopological) conformal defect and yields a set of associated scaling dimensions\n$\\Delta_{\\alpha}$, and (ii) construction and coarse-graining of a generalized\ntranslation operator using a local unitary transformation that moves the\ndefect, which only exist for topological conformal defects and yields the\ncorresponding conformal spins $s_{\\alpha}$.\n", "  In the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) emerging at the transition metal\noxide surface and interface, it has been pointed out that the Rashba spin-orbit\ninteraction, the momentum-dependent spin splitting due to broken inversion\nsymmetry and atomic spin-orbit coupling, can have profound effects on\nelectronic ordering in the spin, orbit, and charge channels, and may help give\nrise to exotic phenomena such as ferromagnetism-superconductivity coexistence\nand topological superconductivity. Although a large Rashba splitting is\nexpected to improve experimental accessibility of such phenomena, it has not\nbeen understood how we can maximally enhance this splitting. Here, we present a\npromising route to realize significant Rashba-type band splitting using a thin\nfilm heterostructure. Based on first-principles methods and analytic model\nanalyses, a tantalate monolayer on BaHfO$_3$ is shown to host two-dimensional\nbands originating from Ta $t_{2g}$ states with strong Rashba spin splittings -\nup to nearly 10% of the bandwidth - at both the band minima and saddle points\ndue to the maximal breaking of the inversion symmetry. Such 2DEG band structure\nmakes this oxide heterostructure a promising platform for realizing both a\ntopological superconductor which hosts Majorana fermions and the electron\ncorrelation physics with strong spin-orbit coupling.\n", "  We experimentally and theoretically investigate the microwave transmission\nline shape of the cavity-magnon-polariton (CMP) created by inserting a low\ndamping magnetic insulator into a high quality 3D microwave cavity. While fixed\nfield measurements are found to have the expected Lorentzian characteristic, at\nfixed frequencies the field swept line shape is in general asymmetric. Such\nfixed frequency measurements demonstrate that microwave transmission can be\nused to access magnetic characteristics of the CMP, such as the field line\nwidth $\\Delta H$. By developing an effective oscillator model of the microwave\ntransmission we show that these line shape features are general characteristics\nof harmonic coupling. At the same time, at the classical level the underlying\nphysical mechanism of the CMP is electrodynamic phase correlation and a second\nmodel based on this principle also accurately reproduces the experimental line\nshape features. In order to understand the microscopic origin of the effective\ncoupled oscillator model and to allow for future studies of CMP phenomena to\nextend into the quantum regime, we develop a third, microscopic description,\nbased on a Green's function formalism. Using this method we calculate the\ntransmission spectra and find good agreement with the experimental results.\n", "  We establish a criterion for characterizing superfluidity in interacting,\nparticle-number conserving systems of fermions as topologically trivial or\nnon-trivial. Because our criterion is based on the concept of many-body\nfermionic parity switches, it is directly associated to the observation of the\nfractional Josephson effect and indicates the emergence of zero-energy modes\nthat anticommute with fermionic parity. We tested these ideas on the\nRichardson-Gaudin-Kitaev chain, a particle-number conserving system that is\nsolvable by way of the algebraic Bethe ansatz, and reduces to a long-range\nKitaev chain in the mean-field approximation. Guided by its closed-form\nsolution, we introduce a procedure for constructing many-body Majorana\nzero-energy modes of gapped topological superfluids in terms of coherent\nsuperpositions of states with different number of fermions. We discuss their\nsignificance and the physical conditions required to enable quantum control in\nthe light of superselection rules.\n", "  Recently, using an Atomic Force Microscope and a single cantilever excited at\ndifferent frequencies it was shown that water nanomeniscus can exhibit a\ntransition in mechanical responses when submitted to stimuli above few tens of\nkHz. The use of a single cantilever to explore phenomena at frequencies far\nfrom the cantilever resonance frequency is not a common and well-established\nstrategy, and because water meniscus are ubiquitous in nature, we have also\nstudied the water meniscus mechanical response, the stiffness G' (N/m) and the\ndissipation G\"(kg/s), as a function of frequency by using cantilevers with\ndifferent resonance frequencies. These results, based on classic dynamical AFM\ntechnics, confirm the anomalous mechanical response of water nanomeniscus when\nstimulated at frequencies high enough.\n", "  Recent results on the study of light-quark baryons with the ANL-Osaka\ndynamical coupled-channels (DCC) approach are presented, which contain the N*\nand Delta* spectroscopy via the analysis of pi N and gamma N reactions and the\nLambda* and Sigma* spectroscopy via the analysis of K- p reactions. A recent\napplication of our DCC approach to neutrino-nucleon reactions in the resonance\nregion is also presented.\n", "  \"Stiff\" differential equations are commonplace in engineering and dynamical\nsystems. To solve them we need flexible integrators that can deal with\nrapidly-changing righthand sides. This tutorial describes the application of\n\"adaptive\" [ variable timestep ] integrators to \"stiff\" mechanical problems\nencountered in modern applications of Gibbs' 1902 statistical mechanics. Linear\nharmonic oscillators subject to nonlinear thermal constraints can exhibit\neither stiff or smooth dynamics. Two closely-related examples, Nos\\'e's 1984\ndynamics and Nos\\'e-Hoover 1985 dynamics, are both based on Hamiltonian\nmechanics, as was ultimately clarified by Dettmann and Morriss in 1996. Both\nthese dynamics are consistent with Gibbs' canonical ensemble. Nos\\'e's dynamics\nis \"stiff\" and can present severe numerical difficulties. Nos\\'e-Hoover\ndynamics, though it follows exactly the same trajectory, is \"smooth\" and\nrelatively trouble-free. Our tutorial emphasises the power of adaptive\nintegrators to resolve stiff problems like the Nos\\'e oscillator. The solutions\nobtained illustrate the power of computer graphics to enrich numerical\nsolutions. Adaptive integration with computer graphics are basic to an\nunderstanding of dynamical systems and statistical mechanics. These tools lead\nnaturally into the visualization of intricate fractal structures formed by\nchaos as well as elaborate knots tied by regular nonchaotic dynamics. This work\nwas invited by the American Journal of Physics.\n", "  We propose an accurate clocked single-spin source for ac-spintronic\napplications. Our device consists of a superconducting island covered by a\nferromagnetic insulator layer through which it is coupled to superconducting\nleads. Single-particle transfer relies on the energy gaps and the island's\ncharging energy, and is enabled by a bias and a time-periodic gate voltage.\nAccurate spin transfer is achieved by the ferromagnetic insulator layer which\npolarizes the island, provides spin-selective tunneling barriers and improves\nthe precision by suppressing Andreev reflection. We analyze realistic material\ncombinations and experimental requirements which allow for a clocked spin\ncurrent in the MHz regime.\n", "  We demonstrate amplification (and attenuation) of a probe signal by a driven\ntwo-level quantum system in the Landau-Zener-St\\\"{u}ckelberg-Majorana regime by\nmeans of an experiment, in which a superconducting qubit was strongly coupled\nto a microwave cavity, in a conventional arrangement of circuit quantum\nelectrodynamics. Two different types of flux qubit, specifically a conventional\nJosephson junctions qubit and a phase-slip qubit, show similar results, namely,\nlasing at the working points where amplification takes place. The experimental\ndata are explained by the interaction of the probe signal with Rabi-like\noscillations. The latter are created by constructive interference of\nLandau-Zener-St\\\"{u}ckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) transitions during the driving\nperiod of the qubit. A detailed description of the occurrence of these\noscillations and a comparison of obtained data with both analytic and numerical\ncalculations are given.\n", "  The nonmodal linear stability of the Schwarzschild black hole established in\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 112 (2014) 191101 is generalized to the case of a nonnegative\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda$. Two gauge invariant combinations $G_{\\pm}$ of\nperturbed scalars made out of the Weyl tensor and its first covariant\nderivative are found such that the map $[h_{\\alpha \\beta}] \\to \\left( G_-\n\\left([h_{\\alpha \\beta}] \\right), G_+ \\left([h_{\\alpha \\beta}] \\right) \\right)$\nwith domain the set of equivalent classes $[h_{\\alpha \\beta}]$ under gauge\ntransformations of solutions of the linearized Einstein's equation, is\ninvertible. The way to reconstruct a representative of $[h_{\\alpha \\beta}]$ in\nterms of $(G_-,G_+)$ is given. It is proved that, for an arbitrary perturbation\nconsistent with the background asymptote, $G_+$ and $G_-$ are bounded in the\nthe outer static region. At large times, the perturbation decays leaving a\nlinearized Kerr black hole around the Schwarzschild or Schwarschild de Sitter\nbackground solution. For negative cosmological constant it is shown that there\nis a choice of boundary conditions at the time-like boundary under which the\nSchwarzschild anti de Sitter black hole is unstable. The root of\nChandrasekhar's duality relating odd and even modes is exhibited, and some\ntechnicalities related to this duality and omitted in the original proof of the\n$\\Lambda=0$ case are explained in detail.\n", "  We investigate the implications of one light eV scale sterile neutrino on the\nphysics potential of the proposed long-baseline experiment DUNE. If the future\nshort-baseline experiments confirm the existence of sterile neutrinos, then it\ncan affect the mass hierarchy (MH) and CP-violation (CPV) searches at DUNE. The\nMH sensitivity still remains above 5$\\sigma$ if the three new mixing angles\n($\\theta_{14}, \\theta_{24}, \\theta_{34}$) are all close to $\\theta_{13}$. In\ncontrast, it can decrease to 4$\\sigma$ if the least constrained mixing angle\n$\\theta_{34}$ is close to its upper limit $\\sim 30^0$. We also assess the\nsensitivity to the CPV induced both by the standard CP-phase $\\delta_{13}\n\\equiv \\delta$, and the new CP-phases $\\delta_{14}$ and $\\delta_{34}$. In the\n3+1 scheme, the discovery potential of CPV induced by $\\delta_{13}$ gets\ndeteriorated compared to the 3$\\nu$ case. In particular, the maximal\nsensitivity (reached around $\\delta_{13}$ $\\sim$ $\\pm$ $90^0$) decreases from\n$5\\sigma$ to $4\\sigma$ if all the three new mixing angles are close to\n$\\theta_{13}$. It can further diminish to almost $3\\sigma$ if $\\theta_{34}$ is\nlarge ($\\sim 30^0$). The sensitivity to the CPV due to $\\delta_{14}$ can reach\n3$\\sigma$ for an appreciable fraction of its true values. Interestingly,\n$\\theta_{34}$ and its associated phase $\\delta_{34}$ can influence both the\n$\\nu_e$ appearance and $\\nu_\\mu$ disappearance channels via matter effects,\nwhich in DUNE are pronounced. Hence, DUNE can also probe CPV induced by\n$\\delta_{34}$ provided $\\theta_{34}$ is large. We also reconstruct the two\nphases $\\delta_{13}$ and $\\delta_{14}$. The typical 1$\\sigma$ uncertainty on\n$\\delta_{13}$ ($\\delta_{14}$) is $\\sim20^0$ ($30^0$) if $\\theta_{34} =0$. The\nreconstruction of $\\delta_{14}$ (but not that of $\\delta_{13}$) degrades if\n$\\theta_{34}$ is large.\n", "  In this paper, the Lie group $G_{NC}^{\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma}$, of which the\nkinematical symmetry group $G_{NC}$ of noncommutative quantum mechanics (NCQM)\nis a special case due to fixed nonzero $\\alpha$, $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$, is\nthree-parameter deformation quantized using the method suggested by Ballesteros\nand Musso in \"Quantum Algebras as Quantizations of Dual Poisson-Lie Groups\" [J.\nPhys. A: Math. Theor., 46 (2013), 195203]. A certain family of QUE algebras,\ncorresponding to $G_{NC}^{\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma}$ with two of the deformation\nparameters approaching zero, is found to be in agreement with the existing\nresults of the literature on quantum Heisenberg group. Finally, we dualize the\nunderlying QUE algebra to obtain an expression for the underlying star-product\nbetween smooth functions on $G_{NC}^{\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma}$.\n", "  The absence of fixed momentum excitations in a theory with Lifshitz scale\ninvariance gives rise to exponential suppression of spectral weight in the\nlow-frequency limit. In the holographic dual, this suppression arises as a\nconsequence of a tunneling barrier that decouples the horizon from the\nboundary. We compute the spin-1/2 holographic Green's function and show that\nthe form of the barrier is identical to that of the scalar case. We furthermore\ndemonstrate that the suppression factor is universal in the $\\hat\\omega\\to0$\nlimit where $\\hat\\omega=\\omega/|\\vec k|^z$. In particular, it depends only on\n$\\hat\\omega$ and the critical exponent $z$, and is independent of scaling\ndimension and spin.\n", "  We present algorithmic solutions aimed on post-processing for industrial\nquantum key distribution systems with hardware sifting. The main steps of the\nprocedure are error correction, parameter estimation, and privacy\namplification. Authentication of a classical public communication channel is\nalso considered.\n", "  We report experimental observations of large Bragg reflection from arrays of\ncold atoms trapped near a one-dimensional nanoscale waveguide. By using an\noptical lattice in the evanescent field surrounding a nanofiber with a period\nnearly commensurate with the resonant wavelength, we observe a reflectance of\nup to 75% for the guided mode. Each atom behaves as a partially-reflecting\nmirror and an ordered chain of about 2000 atoms is sufficient to realize an\nefficient Bragg mirror. Measurements of the reflection spectra as a function of\nthe lattice period and the probe polarization are reported. The latter shows\nthe effect of the chiral character of nanoscale waveguides on this reflection.\nThe ability to control photon transport in 1D waveguides coupled to spin\nsystems would enable novel quantum network capabilities and the study of\nmany-body effects emerging from long-range interactions.\n", "  We consider the non-equilibrium time evolution of a translationally invariant\nstate under a Hamiltonian with a localized defect. We discern the situations\nwhere a light-cone spreads out from the defect and separates the system into\nregions with macroscopically different properties. We identify the light-cone\nand propose a procedure to obtain a (quasi-)stationary state describing the\nlate time dynamics of local observables. As an explicit example, we study the\ntime evolution generated by the Hamiltonian of the transverse-field Ising chain\nwith a local defect that cuts the interaction between two sites (a quench of\nthe boundary conditions alongside a global quench). We solve the dynamics\nexactly and show that the late time properties can be obtained with the general\nmethod proposed.\n", "  Biological nanoparticles (BNPs) are of high interest due to their key role in\nvarious biological processes and use as biomarkers. BNP size and molecular\ncomposition are decisive for their functions, but simultaneous determination of\nboth properties with high accuracy remains challenging, which is a severe\nlimitation. Surface-sensitive microscopy allows one to precisely determine\nfluorescence or scattering intensity, but not the size of individual BNPs. The\nlatter is better determined by tracking their random motion in bulk, but the\nlimited illumination volume for tracking this motion impedes reliable intensity\ndetermination. We here show that attaching BNPs (specifically, vesicles and\nfunctionalized gold NPs) to a supported lipid bilayer, subjecting them to a\nhydrodynamic flow, and tracking their motion via surface-sensitive imaging\nenable to determine their diffusion coefficients and flow-induced drift\nvelocities and to accurately quantify both BNP size and emission intensity. For\nvesicles, the high accuracy is demonstrated by resolving the expected\nradius-squared dependence of their fluorescence intensity.\n", "  We theoretically study a one dimensional p-wave superconducting mesoscopic\nring interrupted by a weak link and coupled inductively to a microwave cavity.\nWe establish an input-output description for the cavity field in the presence\nof the ring, and identify the electronic contributions to the cavity response\nand their dependence on various parameters, such as the magnetic flux, chemical\npotential, and cavity frequency. We show that the cavity response is $4\\pi$\nperiodic as a function of the magnetic flux in the topological region, stemming\nfrom the so called fractional Josephson current carried by the Majorana\nfermions, while it is $2\\pi$ periodic in the non-topological phase, consistent\nwith the normal Josephson effect. We find a strong dependence of the signal on\nthe cavity frequency, as well as on the parity of the ground state. Our model\ntakes into account fully the interplay between the low-energy Majorana modes\nand the gaped bulks states, which we show is crucial for visualizing the\nevolution of the Josephson effect during the transition from the topological to\nthe trivial phase.\n", "  Spin-weighted spherical functions provide a useful tool for analyzing\ntensor-valued functions on the sphere. A tensor field can be decomposed into\ncomplex-valued functions by taking contractions with tangent vectors on the\nsphere and the normal to the sphere. These component functions are usually\npresented as functions on the sphere itself, but this requires an implicit\nchoice of distinguished tangent vectors with which to contract. Thus, we may\nmore accurately say that spin-weighted spherical functions are functions of\nboth a point on the sphere and a choice of frame in the tangent space at that\npoint. The distinction becomes extremely important when transforming the\ncoordinates in which these functions are expressed, because the implicit choice\nof frame will also transform. Here, it is proposed that spin-weighted spherical\nfunctions should be treated as functions on the spin group. This approach more\ncleanly reflects the geometry involved, and allows for a more elegant\ndescription of the behavior of spin-weighted functions. In this form, the\nspin-weighted spherical harmonics have simple expressions as elements of the\nWigner $\\mathfrak{D}$ representations, and transformations under rotation are\nsimple. Two variants of the angular-momentum operator are defined directly in\nterms of the spin group; one is the standard angular-momentum operator\n$\\mathbf{L}$, while the other is shown to be related to the spin-raising\noperator $\\eth$. Computer code is also included, providing an explicit\nimplementation of the spin-weighted spherical harmonics in this form.\n", "  In this letter, we will demonstrate that the breaking of supersymmetry by a\nnon-anticommutative deformation can be used to generate the generalized\nuncertainty principle. We will analyse the physical reasons for this\nobservation, in the framework of string theory. We also discuss the relation\nbetween the generalized uncertainty principle and the Lee-Wick field theories.\n", "  Soft actuators are receiving increasing attention from the engineering\ncommunity, not only in research but even for industrial applications. Among\nsoft actuators, fibre-reinforced Bending Fluidic Actuators (BFAs) became very\npopular thanks to features such as robustness and easy design and fabrication.\nHowever, an accurate modelling of these smart structures, taking into account\nall the nonlinearities involved, is a challenging task. In this effort, we\npropose an analytical mechanical model to capture the quasi-static response of\nfibre-reinforced BFAs. The model is fully 3D and for the first time includes\nthe effect of the pressure on the lateral surface of the chamber as well as the\nnon-constant torque produced by the pressure at the tip. The presented model\ncan be used for design and control, while providing information about the\nmechanics of these complex actuators.\n", "  An exact correspondence between a black hole and an accelerating mirror is\ndemonstrated. It is shown that for a massless minimally coupled scalar field\nthe same Bogolubov coefficients connecting the \"in\" and \"out\" states occur for\na (1+1)D flat spacetime with a particular perfectly reflecting accelerating\nboundary trajectory and a (1+1)D curved spacetime in which a null shell\ncollapses to form a black hole. Generalization of the latter to the (3+1)D case\nis discussed. The spectral dynamics is computed in both (1+1)-dimensional\nspacetimes along with the energy flux in the spacetime with a mirror. It is\nshown that the approach to equilibrium is monotonic, asymmetric in terms of the\nrate, and there is a specific time which characterizes the system when it is\nthe most out-of-equilibrium.\n", "  Molecular signalling in living cells occurs at low copy numbers and is\nthereby inherently limited by the noise imposed by thermal diffusion. The\nprecision at which biochemical receptors can count signalling molecules is\nintimately related to the noise correlation time. In addition to passive\nthermal diffusion, messenger RNA and vesicle-engulfed signalling molecules can\ntransiently bind to molecular motors and are actively transported across\nbiological cells. Active transport is most beneficial when trafficking occurs\nover large distances, for instance up to the order of 1 metre in neurons. Here\nwe explain how intermittent active transport allows for faster equilibration\nupon a change in concentration triggered by biochemical stimuli. Moreover, we\nshow how intermittent active excursions induce qualitative changes in the noise\nin effectively one-dimensional systems such as dendrites. Thereby they allow\nfor significantly improved signalling precision in the sense of a smaller\nrelative deviation in the concentration read-out by the receptor. On the basis\nof linear response theory we derive the exact mean field precision limit for\ncounting actively transported molecules. We explain how intermittent active\nexcursions disrupt the recurrence in the molecular motion, thereby facilitating\nimproved signalling accuracy. Our results provide a deeper understanding of how\nrecurrence affects molecular signalling precision in biological cells and novel\ndiagnostic devices.\n", "  Pd$_{81}$Ge$_{19}$ metallic glass was investigated by neutron diffraction,\nX-ray diffraction and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy\n(EXAFS) at the Ge K-edge. Large scale structural models were obtained by\nfitting the three measurements simultaneously in the framework of the reverse\nMonte Carlo simulation technique. It was found that the experimental data sets\ncan be adequately fitted without Ge-Ge nearest neighbours. Mean Pd-Pd and Pd-Ge\ndistances are 2.80$\\pm$0.02 {\\AA} and 2.50$\\pm$0.02 {\\AA}, respectively. The\ntotal average coordination number of Pd is 12.1$\\pm$0.5 while Ge is surrounded\nby 10.6$\\pm$1.1 Pd atoms. The coordination numbers calculated from partial pair\ncorrelation functions were compared to those obtained by Voronoi tessellation\nmethod. It was found that the latter technique overestimates the number of\nnearest neighbours by about 20% due to the significant contribution of distant\npairs.\n", "  The presence of $R$-parity violating (RPV) supersymmetric interactions\ninvolving high-energy neutrinos can lead to resonant production of TeV-scale\nsquarks inside large-volume neutrino detectors. Using the ultra-high energy\nneutrino events observed recently at the IceCube, with the fact that for a\ngiven power-law flux of astrophysical neutrinos, there is no statistically\nsignificant deviation in the current data from the Standard Model expectations,\nwe derive robust upper limits on the RPV couplings as a function of the\nresonantly-produced squark mass, independent of the other unknown model\nparameters, as long as the squarks decay dominantly to 2-body final states\ninvolving leptons and quarks through the RPV couplings. With more statistics,\nwe expect these limits to be comparable/complementary to the existing limits\nfrom direct collider searches and other low-energy processes.\n", "  We performed a comprehensive angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study\nof the electronic band structure of LaOFeAs single crystals. We found that\nsamples cleaved at low temperature show an unstable and highly complicated band\nstructure, whereas samples cleaved at high temperature exhibit a stable and\nclearer electronic structure. Using \\emph{in-situ} surface doping with K and\nsupported by first-principles calculations, we identify both surface and bulk\nbands. Our assignments are confirmed by the difference in the temperature\ndependence of the bulk and surface states.\n", "  The production of $W^{\\pm}Z$ events in proton--proton collisions at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV is measured with the ATLAS detector at the LHC.\nThe collected data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb$^{-1}$. The\n$W^{\\pm}Z$ candidates are reconstructed using leptonic decays of the gauge\nbosons into electrons or muons. The measured inclusive cross section in the\ndetector fiducial region for leptonic decay modes is $\\sigma_{W^\\pm Z\n\\rightarrow \\ell^{'} \\nu \\ell \\ell}^{\\textrm{fid.}} = 63.2 \\pm 3.2$ (stat.)\n$\\pm 2.6$ (sys.) $\\pm 1.5$ (lumi.) fb. In comparison, the next-to-leading-order\nStandard Model prediction is $53.4^{+3.6}_{-2.8}$ fb. The extrapolation of the\nmeasurement from the fiducial to the total phase space yields\n$\\sigma_{W^{\\pm}Z}^{\\textrm{tot.}} = 50.6 \\pm 2.6$ (stat.) $\\pm 2.0$ (sys.)\n$\\pm 0.9$ (th.) $\\pm 1.2$ (lumi.) pb, in agreement with a recent\nnext-to-next-to-leading-order calculation of $48.2^{+1.1}_{-1.0}$ pb. The cross\nsection as a function of jet multiplicity is also measured, together with the\ncharge-dependent $W^+Z$ and $W^-Z$ cross sections and their ratio.\n", "  We present a complete theory of bicircular high-order-harmonic emission from\nN-fold rotationally symmetric molecules. Using a rotating frame of reference we\npredict the complete structure of the high-order-harmonic spectra for arbitrary\ndriving frequency ratios and show how molecular symmetries can be directly\nidentified from the harmonic signal. Our findings reveal that a characteristic\nfingerprint of rotational molecular symmetries can be universally observed in\nthe ultrafast response of molecules to strong bicircular fields.\n", "  We review the calculation of Fermi's golden rule for a system of $N$-body\ndipoles, magnetic or electric, weakly interacting with a blackbody radiation.\nBy using the magnetic or electric field-field correlation function evaluated in\nthe 1960s for the black body radiation, we deduce a general formula for the\ntransition rates and study its limiting, fully coherent or fully incoherent,\nregimes.\n", "  Memory effects play a fundamental role in the study of the dynamics of open\nquantum systems. There exist two conceptually distinct notions of memory\ndiscussed for quantum channels in the literature. In quantum information theory\nquantum channels with memory are characterised by the existence of correlations\nbetween successive applications of the channel on a sequence of quantum\nsystems. In open quantum systems theory memory effects arise dynamically during\nthe time evolution of quantum systems, and define non-Markovian dynamics. Here\nwe relate and combine these two different concepts of memory. In particular, we\nstudy the interplay between correlations between multiple uses of quantum\nchannels and non-Markovianity as non-divisibility of the $t$-parametrized\nfamily of channels defining the dynamical map.\n", "  Split-execution computing leverages the capabilities of multiple\ncomputational models to solve problems, but splitting program execution across\ndifferent computational models incurs costs associated with the translation\nbetween domains. We analyze the performance of a split-execution computing\nsystem developed from conventional and quantum processing units (QPUs) by using\nbehavioral models that track resource usage. We focus on asymmetric processing\nmodels built using conventional CPUs and a family of special-purpose QPUs that\nemploy quantum computing principles. Our performance models account for the\ntranslation of a classical optimization problem into the physical\nrepresentation required by the quantum processor while also accounting for\nhardware limitations and conventional processor speed and memory. We conclude\nthat the bottleneck in this split-execution computing system lies at the\nquantum-classical interface and that the primary time cost is independent of\nquantum processor behavior.\n", "  This work introduces original explicit solutions for the elastic fields\nradiated by non-uniformly moving, straight, screw or edge dislocations in an\nisotropic medium, in the form of time-integral representations in which\nacceleration-dependent contributions are explicitly separated out. These\nsolutions are obtained by applying an isotropic regularization procedure to\ndistributional expressions of the elastodynamic fields built on the Green\ntensor of the Navier equation. The obtained regularized field expressions are\nsingularity-free, and depend on the dislocation density rather than on the\nplastic eigenstrain. They cover non-uniform motion at arbitrary speeds,\nincluding faster-than-wave ones. A numerical method of computation is\ndiscussed, that rests on discretizing motion along an arbitrary path in the\nplane transverse to the dislocation, into a succession of time intervals of\nconstant velocity vector over which time-integrated contributions can be\nobtained in closed form. As a simple illustration, it is applied to the\nelastodynamic equivalent of the Tamm problem, where fields induced by a\ndislocation accelerated from rest beyond the longitudinal wave speed, and\nthereafter put to rest again, are computed. As expected, the proposed\nexpressions produce Mach cones, the dynamic build-up and decay of which is\nillustrated by means of full-field calculations.\n", "  We investigate a generalized Aubry-Andr\\'e-Harper (AAH) model with p-wave\nsuperconducting pairing. Both the hopping amplitudes between the nearest\nneighboring lattice sites and the on-site potentials in this system are\nmodulated by a cosine function with a periodicity of $1/\\alpha$. In the\nincommensurate case [$\\alpha=(\\sqrt{5}-1)/2$], due to the modulations on the\nhopping amplitudes, the critical region of this quasiperiodic system is\nsignificantly reduced and the system becomes more easily to be turned from\nextended states to localized states. In the commensurate case ($\\alpha = 1/2$),\nwe find that this model shows three different phases when we tune the system\nparameters: Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)-like trivial, SSH-like topological, and\nKitaev-like topological phases. The phase diagrams and the topological quantum\nnumbers for these phases are presented in this work. This generalized AAH model\ncombined with superconducting pairing provides us with a useful testfield for\nstudying the phase transitions from extended states to Anderson localized\nstates and the transitions between different topological phases.\n", "  Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we adopt the sSFR-$\\Sigma_{1kpc}$ diagram\nas a diagnostic tool to understand quenching in different environments. sSFR is\nthe specific star formation rate, and $\\Sigma_{1kpc}$ is the stellar surface\ndensity in the inner kpc. Although both the host halo mass and group-centric\ndistance affect the satellite population, we find that these can be\ncharacterised by a single number, the quenched fraction, such that key features\nof the sSFR-$\\Sigma_{1kpc}$ diagram vary smoothly with this proxy for the\n\"environment\". Particularly, the sSFR of star-forming galaxies decreases\nsmoothly with this quenched fraction, the sSFR of satellites being 0.1 dex\nlower than in the field. Furthermore, $\\Sigma_{1kpc}$ of the transition\ngalaxies (i.e., the \"green valley\" or GV) decreases smoothly with the\nenvironment, by as much as 0.2 dex for $M_* = 10^{9.75-10} M_{\\odot}$ from the\nfield, and decreasing for satellites in larger halos and at smaller radial\ndistances within same-mass halos. We interpret this shift as indicating the\nrelative importance of today's field quenching track vs. the cluster quenching\ntrack. These environmental effects in the sSFR-$\\Sigma_{1kpc}$ diagram are most\nsignificant in our lowest mass range ($9.75 < \\log M_{*}/M_{\\odot} < 10$). One\nfeature that is shared between all environments is that at a given $M_{*}$\nquenched galaxies have about 0.2-0.3 dex higher $\\Sigma_{1kpc}$ than the\nstar-forming population. These results indicate that either $\\Sigma_{1kpc}$\nincreases (subsequent to satellite quenching), or $\\Sigma_{1kpc}$ for\nindividual galaxies remains unchanged, but the original $M_*$ or the time of\nquenching is significantly different from those now in the GV.\n", "  We summarize a laser-ranged satellite test of frame-dragging, a prediction of\nGeneral Relativity, and then concentrate on the estimate of thermal thrust, an\nimportant perturbation affecting the accuracy of the test. The frame dragging\nstudy analysed 3.5 years of data from the LARES satellite and a longer period\nof time for the two LAGEOS satellites. Using the gravity field GGM05S obtained\nvia the Grace mission, which measures the Earth's gravitational field, the\nprediction of General Relativity is confirmed with a 1-$\\sigma$ formal error of\n0.002, and a systematic error of 0.05. The result for the value of the frame\ndragging around the Earth is $\\mu$ = 0.994, compared to $\\mu$ = 1 predicted by\nGeneral Relativity. The thermal force model assumes heat flow from the sun\n(visual) and from Earth (IR) to the satellite core and to the fused silica\nreflectors on the satellite, and reradiation into space. For a roughly current\nepoch (days 1460 - 1580 after launch) we calculate an average along-track drag\nof -0.50 $pm/s^{2}$.\n", "  Developing devices that can reliably and accurately demonstrate the\nprinciples of superposition and entanglement is an on-going challenge for the\nquantum computing community. Modeling and simulation offer attractive means of\ntesting early device designs and establishing expectations for operational\nperformance. However, the complex integrated material systems required by\nquantum device designs are not captured by any single existing computational\nmodeling method. We examine the development and analysis of a multi-staged\ncomputational workflow that can be used to design and characterize silicon\ndonor qubit systems with modeling and simulation. Our approach integrates\nquantum computational chemistry calculations with electrostatic field solvers\nto perform detailed simulations of a phosphorus dopant in silicon. We show how\natomistic details can be synthesized into an operational model for the logical\ngates that define quantum computation in this particular technology. The\nresulting computational workflow realizes a design tool for silicon donor\nqubits that can help verify and validate current and near-term experimental\ndevices.\n", "  The R{\\'e}nyi entropy is one of the important information measures that\ngeneralizes Shannon's entropy. The quantum R{\\'e}nyi entropy has a fundamental\nrole in quantum information theory, therefore, bounding this quantity is of\nvital importance. Another important quantity is R{\\'e}nyi relative entropy on\nwhich R{\\'e}nyi generalization of the conditional entropy, and mutual\ninformation are defined based. Thus, finding lower bound for R{\\'e}nyi relative\nentropy is our goal in this paper. We use matrix inequalities to prove new\nbounds on the entropy of type $\\beta$, R{\\'e}nyi entropy.\n", "  In four dimensions, partially massless fields of all spins and depths possess\na duality invariance akin to electric-magnetic duality. We construct\nmetric-like gauge invariant curvature tensors for partially massless fields of\nall integer spins and depths, and show how the partially massless equations of\nmotion can be recovered from first order field equations and Bianchi identities\nfor these curvatures. This formulation displays duality in its manifestly local\nand covariant form, in which it acts to interchange the field equations and\nBianchi identities.\n", "  We present a simple technique to calculate spin-orbit coupling, $\\langle {\\bf\nL}\\cdot{\\bf S} \\rangle$, and branching ratio measured in x-ray absorption\nspectroscopy. Our method is for first-principles electronic structure\ncalculation and its implementation is straightforward for any of standard\nformulations and codes. We applied this technique to several different large\nspin-orbit coupling iridates. The calculated $\\langle{ {\\bf L}\\cdot{\\bf S}}\n\\rangle$ and branching ratio of a prototype $j_{\\rm eff}$=1/2 Mott insulator,\nSr$_2$IrO$_4$, are in good agreement with recent experimental data over the\nwide range of Rh-doping. Three different double perovskite iridates (namely,\nSr$_2$MgIrO$_6$, Sr$_2$ScIrO$_6$, and Sr$_2$TiIrO$_6$) are also well described.\nThis technique can serve as a promising tool for studying large spin-orbit\ncoupling materials from first-principles and for understanding experiments.\n", "  There is strong interest in discovering or designing wide gap Chern\ninsulators. Here we follow a Chern insulator to trivial Mott insulator\ntransition versus interaction strength U in a honeycomb lattice Fe-based\ntransition metal oxide, discovering that a spin-orbit coupling energy scale\n$\\xi$=40 meV can produce and maintain a topologically entangled Chern\ninsulating state against large band structure changes arising from an\ninteraction strength U up to 60 times as large. Within the Chern phase the\nminimum gap switches from the zone corner K to the zone center $\\Gamma$ while\nmaintaining the topological structure. At a critical strength $U_c$, the\ncontinuous evolution of the electronic structure encounters a gap closing then\nreopening, upon which the system reverts to a trivial Mott insulating phase.\nThis Chern insulator phase of honeycomb lattice Fe$^{2+}$ BaFe$_2$(PO$_4$)$_2$\ncorresponds to a large Chern number C=-3 that will provide enhanced anomalous\nHall conductivity due to the associated three edge states threading through the\nbulk gap of 80 meV.\n", "  Cone beam projection is an essential and particularly time consuming part of\nany iterative tomographic reconstruction algorithm. On current graphics\nhardware especially the amount and pattern of memory accesses is a limiting\nfactor when read-only textures cannot be used. With the final objective of\naccelerating iterative reconstruction techniques, a non-oversampling\nJoseph-like raytracing projection algorithm for three dimensions featuring both\na branchless sampling loop and a cache friendly memory access pattern is\npresented. An interpretation of the employed interpolation scheme is given with\nrespect to the effective beam and voxel models implied. The method is further\ncompared to existing techniques, and the modifications required to implement\nfurther voxel and beam shape models are outlined. Both memory access rates and\ntotal run time are benchmarked on a current consumer grade graphics processing\nunit and explicitly compared to the performance of a classic Digital\nDifferential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm. The presented raytracer achieves memory\naccess rates of 292 GB/s in read-and-write memory and 502 GB/s in read-only\ntexture memory. It outperforms the DDA in terms of total run time by a factor\nof up to five and achives 170 to 300 projections of a $512^{3}$ voxel volume\nper second.\n", "  We show that complex, massive spin-1 fields minimally coupled to Einstein's\ngravity with a negative cosmological constant, admit asymptotically anti-de\nSitter self-gravitating solutions. Focusing on 4-dimensional spacetimes, we\nstart by obtaining analytical solutions in the test-field limit, where the\nProca field equations can be solved in a fixed anti-de Sitter background, and\nthen find fully non-linear solutions numerically. These solutions are a natural\nextension of the recently found asymptotically flat Proca stars and share\nsimilar properties with scalar boson stars. In particular, we show that they\nare stable against spherically symmetric linear perturbations for a range of\nfundamental frequencies limited by their point of maximum mass. We finish with\nan overview of the behavior of Proca stars in $5$ dimensions.\n", "  The understanding of dynamical evolutions of interacting photon pulses in\nRydberg atomic ensemble is the prerequisite for realizing quantum devices with\nsuch system. We present an approach that efficiently simulates the dynamical\nprocesses, using a set of local functions we construct to reflect the profiles\nof narrowband pulses. For two counter-propagating photon pulses, our approach\npredicts the distinct phenomena from the widely concerned Rydberg blockade to\nthe previously less noticed significant absorption in the anomalous dispersion\nregime, which can occur by respectively setting the pulse frequency to the\nappropriate values. Our numerical simulations also demonstrate how spatially\nextending photon pulses become deformed under realistic non-uniform interaction\nover their distributions.\n", "  Good explanations for the unusual light curve of Boyajian's Star have been\nhard to find. Recent results by Montet & Simon lend strength and plausibility\nto the conclusion of Schaefer that in addition to short-term dimmings, the star\nalso experiences large, secular decreases in brightness on decadal timescales.\nThis, combined with a lack of long-wavelength excess in the star's spectral\nenergy distribution, strongly constrains scenarios involving circumstellar\nmaterial, including hypotheses invoking a spherical cloud of artifacts. We show\nthat the timings of the deepest dimmings appear consistent with being randomly\ndistributed, and that the star's reddening and narrow sodium absorption is\nconsistent with the total, long-term dimming observed. Following Montet &\nSimon's encouragement to generate alternative hypotheses, we attempt to\ncircumscribe the space of possible explanations with a range of plausibilities,\nincluding: a cloud in the outer solar system, structure in the ISM, natural and\nartificial material orbiting Boyajian's Star, an intervening object with a\nlarge disk, and variations in Boyajian's Star itself. We find the ISM and\nintervening disk models more plausible than the other natural models.\n", "  We consider a charged conductor of arbitrary shape, in electrostatic\nequilibrium, with one or more cavities inside it, and with fixed charges placed\noutside the conductors and inside the cavities. The field inside a particular\ncavity is then only due to charges within that cavity itself and to the surface\ncharge induced on the surface of the same cavity. A similar statement holds for\nthe exterior of the conductor. Although this is an elementary property of\nconductors, it is not a trivial statement, as explained in this article.\nUndergraduate texts in electrodynamics do not discuss at length or provide a\ncomplete argument for an important problem such as this. Two simple and\ncomplete proofs are provided in this note with the help of the standard\nelectrostatic uniqueness theorems.\n", "  The triply heavy flavour baryons are studied using the Quark-diquark\ndescription of the three-body system. The confinement potential for present\nstudy of triply heavy flavour baryons is assumed as coulomb plus power\npotential with power index $\\nu$. We have solved Schrodinger equation\nnumerically to calculate the masses of triply heavy flavour baryons. The masses\nand magnetic moments of triply heavy flavour baryons are computed for different\npower indices, $\\nu$, starting from 0.4 to 1.0. The predicted masses and\nmagnetic moments are in good agreement with other theoretical predictions.\n", "  Recently an exact duality between topological string and the spectral theory\nof operators constructed from mirror curves to toric Calabi-Yau threefolds has\nbeen proposed. At the same time an exact quantization condition for the cluster\nintegrable systems associated to these geometries has been conjectured. The\nconsistency between the two approaches leads to an infinite set of constraints\nfor the refined BPS invariants of the toric Calabi-Yau threefolds. We show\nthat, for the Y^{N,m} geometries, these constraints can be derived from the\nK-theoretic blowup equations for SU(N) SYM with generic Chern-Simons invariant\nm. In particular this furnishes a proof of the BPS constraints in the case of m\n= 0.\n", "  This article is preface to the SIGMA special issue \"Tensor Models, Formalism\nand Applications\", http://www.emis.de/journals/SIGMA/Tensor_Models.html. The\nissue is a collection of eight excellent, up to date reviews on random tensor\nmodels. The reviews combine pedagogical introductions meant for a general\naudience with presentations of the most recent developments in the field. This\npreface aims to give a condensed panoramic overview of random tensors as the\nnatural generalization of random matrices to higher dimensions.\n", "  Recent ALMA observations unveiled the structure of CO gas in the 23 Myr-old\n$\\beta$ Pictoris planetary system, a component that has been discovered in many\nsimilarly young debris disks. We here present ALMA CO J=2-1 observations, at an\nimproved spectro-spatial resolution and sensitivity compared to previous CO\nJ=3-2 observations. We find that 1) the CO clump is radially broad, favouring\nthe resonant migration over the giant impact scenario for its dynamical origin,\n2) the CO disk is vertically tilted compared to the main dust disk, at an angle\nconsistent with the scattered light warp. We then use position-velocity\ndiagrams to trace Keplerian radii in the orbital plane of the disk. Assuming a\nperfectly edge-on geometry, this shows a CO scale height increasing with radius\nas $R^{0.75}$, and an electron density (derived from CO line ratios through\nNLTE analysis) in agreement with thermodynamical models. Furthermore, we show\nhow observations of optically thin line ratios can solve the primordial versus\nsecondary origin dichotomy in gas-bearing debris disks. As shown for $\\beta$\nPictoris, subthermal (NLTE) CO excitation is symptomatic of H$_2$ densities\nthat are insufficient to shield CO from photodissociation over the system's\nlifetime. This means that replenishment from exocometary volatiles must be\ntaking place, proving the secondary origin of the disk. In this scenario,\nassuming steady state production/destruction of CO gas, we derive the CO+CO$_2$\nice abundance by mass in $\\beta$ Pic's exocomets to be at most $\\sim$6%,\nconsistent with comets in our own Solar System and in the coeval HD181327\nsystem.\n", "  Emergence of higher spin relativistic fermionic materials becomes a new\nfavorite in the study of condensed matter physics. Massive Rarita-Schwinger\n3/2-spinor was known owning very exotic properties, such as the superluminal\nfermionic modes and even being unstable in an external magnetic field. Due to\nthe superluminal modes and the non-trivial constraints on the Rarita-Schwinger\ngas, we exposit anomalous properties of the Hall effects in (2+1)-dimensions\nwhich subvert the well-known quantum Hall paradigms. First, the Hall\nconductance of a pure Rarita-Schwinger gas is step-like but not\nplateau-quantized, instead of the linear dependence on the filling factor for a\npure spin-1/2 Dirac gas. In reality, the Hall conductance of the Dirac gas is\nof quantized integer plateaus with the unit $\\frac{e^2}h$ due to the\nlocalization away from the Landau level centers. If the general localization\nrule is applicable to the disordered Rarita-Schwinger gas, the Hall plateaus\nare also expected to appear but they are nonlinearly dependent on the Landau\nlevel index. Furthermore, there is a critical magnetic field beyond which\nhigher Landau levels become unstable. This confines the filling factor of the\nsystem. We also show that the non-hermitness of the effective Hamiltonian is\nnot crucial to the nonlinearity of the quantum Hall conductance.\n", "  As part of our program to build a complete radio and X-ray database of all\nthe 3CR extragalactic radio sources, we present an analysis of 93 sources for\nwhich Chandra archival data are available. Most of these sources have been\nalready published. Here we provide a uniform re-analysis and present nuclear\nX-ray fluxes and X-ray emission associated with radio jet knots and hotspots\nusing both publicly available radio images and new radio images that have been\nconstructed from data available in the VLA archive. For about 1/3 of the\nsources in the selected sample a comparison between the Chandra and the radio\nobservations was not reported in the literature: we find X-ray detections of 2\nnew radio jet knots and 17 hotspots. We also report the X-ray detection of\nextended emission from the intergalactic medium of 15 galaxy clusters, two of\nwhich were most likely unknown previously.\n", "  We present a Bayesian algorithm to combine optical imaging of unresolved\nobjects from distinct epochs and observation platforms for orbit determination\nand tracking. By propagating the non-Gaussian uncertainties we are able to\noptimally combine imaging of arbitrary signal-to-noise ratios, allowing the\nintegration of data from low-cost sensors. Our Bayesian approach to image\ncharacterization also allows large compression of imaging data without loss of\nstatistical information. With a computationally efficient algorithm to combine\nmultiple observation epochs and multiple telescopes, we show statistically\noptimal orbit inferences.\n", "  We have developed a maximum likelihood source detection method capable of\ndetecting ultra-faint streaks with surface brightnesses approximately an order\nof magnitude fainter than the pixel level noise. Our maximum likelihood\ndetection method is a model based approach that requires no a priori knowledge\nabout the streak location, orientation, length, or surface brightness. This\nmethod enables discovery of typically undiscovered objects, and enables the\nutilization of low-cost sensors (i.e., higher-noise data). The method also\neasily facilitates multi-epoch co-addition. We will present the results from\nthe application of this method to simulations, as well as real low earth orbit\nobservations.\n", "  We determine and compare structural, dynamical, and electronic properties of\nliquid water at near ambient conditions through density-functional molecular\ndynamics simulations, when using either plane-wave or atomic-orbital basis\nsets. In both frameworks, the electronic structure and the atomic forces are\nself-consistently determined within the same theoretical scheme based on a\nnonlocal density functional accounting for van der Waals interactions. The\noverall properties of liquid water achieved within the two frameworks are in\nexcellent agreement with each other. Thus, our study supports that\nimplementations with plane-wave or atomic-orbital basis sets yield equivalent\nresults and can be used indiscriminately in study of liquid water or aqueous\nsolutions.\n", "  Effective Hamiltonians, when used in tandem with statistical mechanics\ntechniques, offer a rigorous connection between 0 Kelvin ab-initio predictions\nand finite temperature experimental observations. For alloys, cluster expansion\nHamiltonians can coarse-grain out the complex, many-body electron problem of\ndensity functional theory, yielding a series of simple site-wise basis\nfunctions (e.g., products of site occupancy variables) on an atomic scale. The\nresulting energy polynomial is computationally inexpensive, and hence suitable\nfor the (tens of) thousands of calculations of large systems required by\nstochastic methods. We present a new method to run the statical mechanics\nproblem \"in reverse\", using high-temperature observations and thermodynamic\nconnections to construct an effective Hamiltonian and thereby predict the 0\nKelvin energy spectrum and associated ground states. By re-examining the\ncluster expansion formalism through the lens of entropy-maximization\napproaches, we develop an algorithm to select clusters and determine cluster\ninteractions using only a few, high-temperature experiments on disordered\nphases. We demonstrate that our approach can recover not only the stable ground\nstates at 0 Kelvin, but also the full phase behavior for three realistic\ntwo-dimensional and three-dimensional alloy test-cases.\n", "  A liquid subjected to negative pressure is thermodynamically metastable.\nConfined within a small volume, negative pressure can build up until cavities\nform spontaneously. The critical negative pressure for cavitation in water has\nbeen theoretically predicted to be in the range of -100 to -200 MPa at room\ntemperature, whereas values around -30 MPa have been obtained by many\nexperiments. The discrepancy has yet to be resolved. In this study we perform\nmolecular dynamics simulations to study cavitation of water under volume\ncontrolled stretching. It is found that liquid water exhibits a nonlinear\nelastic compressibility (or stretchability) under hydrostatic tension and\nremains stable within the confined volume until spontaneous cavitation occurs\nat a critical strain. Subsequently, as the volume-controlled stretching\ncontinues, the cavity grows stably and the hydrostatic tension decreases\ncontinuously until the box volume is large enough for another transition to\nform a water droplet. A modified nucleation theory is proposed to predict the\ncritical condition for cavitation. In particular, a strong dependence of the\ncritical strain and stress for cavitation on the initial liquid volume is\npredicted by the modified nucleation theory, which may offer a possible\nexplanation for the discrepancies in the values of the critical negative\npressure obtained from experiments.\n", "  We summarise the main features of VINCIA's antenna-based treatment of QCD\ninitial- and final-state showers, which includes iterated tree-level\nmatrix-element corrections and automated evaluations of perturbative shower\nuncertainties. The latter are computed on the fly and are cast as a set of\nalternative weights for each generated event. The resulting algorithm has been\nmade publicly available as a plug-in to the PYTHIA 8 event generator.\n", "  We study the sensitivity of atmospheric neutrino experiments to the neutrino\nnon-standard interactions (NSI) which is motivated by the tension between the\ntwo mass squared differences extracted from the KamLAND and solar neutrino\nexperiments. In this study the sensitivity of the future Hyper-Kamiokande\nexperiments for 4438 days to NSI is shown. Assuming that the mass hierarchy is\nknown, we find that the best-fit value from the solar neutrino and KamLAND data\ncan be tested at more than 8 $\\sigma$, while the one from the global analysis\ncan be examined at 5.0 $\\sigma$ (1.4 $\\sigma$) for the normal (inverted) mass\nhierarchy.\n", "  It is quite generally assumed that the overdamped Langevin equation provides\na quantitative description of the dynamics of a classical Brownian particle in\nthe long time limit. We establish and investigate a paradigm anomalous\ndiffusion process governed by an underdamped Langevin equation with an explicit\ntime dependence of the system temperature and thus the diffusion and damping\ncoefficients. We show that for this underdamped scaled Brownian motion (UDSBM)\nthe overdamped limit fails to describe the long time behaviour of the system\nand may practically even not exist at all for a certain range of the parameter\nvalues. Thus persistent inertial effects play a non-negligible role even at\nsignificantly long times. From this study a general questions on the\napplicability of the overdamped limit to describe the long time motion of an\nanomalously diffusing particle arises, with profound consequences for the\nrelevance of overdamped anomalous diffusion models. We elucidate our results in\nview of analytical and simulations results for the anomalous diffusion of\nparticles in free cooling granular gases.\n", "  A novel growth technique for low density, non-icosahedral carbon onion-like\nstructures on Cu surface is described. The technique differs with the formation\nof carbon onions inside the C1+ implanted metal surfaces at high temperatures\nwith densities ~ 2 g cm-3 in the form of multishelled icosahedral fullerenes\nwrapped around C60. We report spheroidal cage formation of shell with variable\nshell thickness, radii and curvature on C1+-irradiated Cu surfaces by the\naccumulating C atoms which emerge out of the edges of the implanted sheets and\ngrids. Atom-by-atom C accreting structures grow along the edges, corners and\ncrevices. These, in turn, form the open and closed multiple-shelled cages.\nVariable curvature is the most common feature of the growing structures. The\ngrowth at room temperature does not ensure sphericity of the cages due to the\nabsence of high temperature annealing. These cages have very low density,\nhollow interiors and often exhibit the conspicuous cage-inside-cage structures.\nAnother feature of the as-grown, non-spherical onions is the existence of\nspherical protrusions with different local radii within the same cage.\nFormation of cages with sizes ~ few nanometer to hundreds of nanometer depends\nupon the irradiation rate of C1+. In situ formation and transformations of the\ncages observed under 120 keV electron beam irradiation is described by using a\nnanoelastic model.\n", "  Background: Since their discovery by Karl Langer in the 19th Century, Skin\nTension Lines (STLs) have been used by surgeons to decide the location and\norientation of an incision. Although these lines are patient-specific, most\nsurgeons rely on generic maps to determine their orientation. Beyond the\nimprecise pinch test, there remains no accepted method for determining STLs in\nvivo.\n  Methods: (i) The speed of an elastic motion travelling radially on the skin\nof canine cadavers was measured with a commercial device called the\nReviscometer. (ii) Similar to the original experiments conducted by Karl\nLanger, circular excisions were made on the skin and the geometric changes to\nthe resulting wounds and excised samples were used to determine the orientation\nof STLs.\n  Results: A marked anisotropy in the speed of the elastic wave travelling\nradially was observed. The orientation of the fastest wave was found to\ncorrelate with the orientation of the elongated wound (P<0.001, R^2 = 74%).\nSimilarly, the orientation of fastest wave was the same for both in vivo and\nexcised isolated samples, indicating that the STLs have a structural basis.\nResulting wounds expanded by an average area of 9% (+16% along STL and -10%\nacross) while excised skin shrunk by an average area of 33% (23% along STL and\n10% across).\n  Conclusion: Elastic surface wave propagation has been validated\nexperimentally as a robust method for determining the orientation of STLs\nnon-destructively and non-invasively. This study has implications for the\nidentification of STLs and for the prediction of skin tension levels, both\nimportant factors in both human and veterinary reconstructive surgery.\n", "  The spacetime dependence of the inverse temperature four-vector\n$\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ for certain states of the quantized Klein-Gordon field on\n(parts of) Minkowski spacetime is discussed. These states fulfill a recently\nproposed version of the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) boundary value condition,\nthe so-called \"local KMS (LKMS) condition\". It turns out that, depending on the\nmass parameter $m\\geq 0$, any such state can be extended either (i) to a LKMS\nstate on some forward or backward lightcone, with $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$\ndepending linearily on spacetime, or (ii) to a thermal equilibrium (KMS) state\non all of Minkowski space with constant $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$. This parallels\npreviously known results for local thermal equilibrium (LTE) states of the\nquantized Klein-Gordon field. Furthermore, in the case of a massless field our\nresults point to a discrepancy with some classic results in general approaches\nto (non-quantum) relativistic thermodynamics.\n", "  We examine the properties of the galaxies and dark matter haloes residing in\nthe cluster infall region surrounding the simulated $\\Lambda$CDM galaxy cluster\nstudied by Elahi et al. (2016) at z=0. The\n$1.1\\times10^{15}h^{-1}\\text{M}_{\\odot}$ galaxy cluster has been simulated with\neight different hydrodynamical codes containing a variety of hydrodynamic\nsolvers and subgrid schemes. All models completed a dark-matter only,\nnon-radiative and full-physics run from the same initial conditions. The\nsimulations contain dark matter and gas with mass resolution\n$m_{\\text{DM}}=9.01\\times 10^8h^{-1}\\text{M}_{\\odot}$ and\n$m_{\\text{gas}}=1.9\\times 10^8h^{-1}\\text{M}_{\\odot}$ respectively. We find\nthat the synthetic cluster is surrounded by clear filamentary structures that\ncontain ~60% of haloes in the infall region with mass ~$10^{12.5} - 10^{14}\nh^{-1}\\text{M}_{\\odot}$, including 2-3 group-sized haloes ($>\n10^{13}h^{-1}\\text{M}_{\\odot}$). However, we find that only ~10% of objects in\nthe infall region are subhaloes residing in haloes, which may suggest that\nthere is not much ongoing preprocessing occurring in the infall region at z=0.\nBy examining the baryonic content contained within the haloes, we also show\nthat the code-to-code scatter in stellar fraction across all halo masses is\ntypically ~2 orders of magnitude between the two most extreme cases, and this\nis predominantly due to the differences in subgrid schemes and calibration\nprocedures that each model uses. Models that do not include AGN feedback\ntypically produce too high stellar fractions compared to observations by at\nleast ~1 order of magnitude.\n", "  ESA recently called for new \"Science Ideas\" to be investigated in terms of\nfeasibility and technological developments -- for technologies not yet\nsufficiently mature. These ideas may in the future become candidates for M or L\nclass missions within the ESA Science Program.\n  With the launch of Gaia in December 2013, Europe entered a new era of space\nastrometry following in the footsteps of the very successful Hipparcos mission\nfrom the early 1990s. Gaia is the successor to Hipparcos, both of which\noperated in optical wavelengths, and Gaia is two orders of magnitude more\naccurate in the five astrometric parameters and is surveying four orders of\nmagnitude more stars in a vast volume of the Milky Way. The combination of the\nHipparcos/Tycho-2 catalogues with the first early Gaia data release will give\nimproved proper motions over a long ~25 year baseline. The final Gaia solution\nwill also establish a new optical reference frame by means of quasars, by\nlinking the optical counterparts of radio (VLBI) sources defining the\norientation of the reference frame, and by using the zero proper motion of\nquasars to determine a non-rotating frame.\n  A weakness of Gaia is that it only operates at optical wavelengths. However,\nmuch of the Galactic centre and the spiral arm regions, important for certain\nstudies, are obscured by interstellar extinction and this makes it difficult\nfor Gaia to deeply probe. Traditionally, this problem is overcome by switching\nto the infra-red but this was not possible with Gaia's CCDs. Additionally, to\nscan the entire sky and make global absolute parallax measurements the\nspacecraft must have a constant rotation and this requires that the CCDs\noperate in TDI mode, increasing their complexity.\n", "  The fabrication of functional metamaterials with extreme feature resolution\nfinds a host of applications such as the broad area of surface/light\ninteraction. Non-planar features of such structures can significantly enhance\ntheir performance and tunability, but their facile generation remains a\nchallenge. Here, we show that carefully designed out-of-plane nanopillars made\nof metal-dielectric composites integrated in a metal-dielectric-nanocomposite\nconfiguration, can absorb broadband light very effectively. We further\ndemonstrate that electrohydrodynamic printing in a rapid nanodripping mode, is\nable to generate precise out-of-plane forests of such composite nanopillars\nwith deposition resolutions at the diffraction limit on flat and non-flat\nsubstrates. The nanocomposite nature of the printed material allows the\nfine-tuning of the overall visible light absorption from complete absorption to\ncomplete reflection by simply tuning the pillar height. Almost perfect\nabsorption (~95%) over the entire visible spectrum is achieved by a nanopillar\nforest covering only 6% of the printed area. Adjusting the height of individual\npillar groups by design, we demonstrate on-demand control of the gray scale of\na micrograph with a spatial resolution of 400 nm. These results constitute a\nsignificant step forward in ultra-high resolution facile fabrication of\nout-of-plane nanostructures, important to a broad palette of light design\napplications. nanostructures, important to a broad palette of light design\napplications.\n", "  The study of inclusive charged-particle production in heavy-ion collisions\nprovides insights into the density of the medium and the energy-loss\nmechanisms. The observed suppression of high-$\\textit{p}_\\text{T}$ yield is\ngenerally attributed to energy loss of partons as they propagate through a\ndeconfined state of quarks and gluons - Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) - predicted by\nQCD. Such measurements allow the characterization of the QGP by comparison with\nmodels. In these proceedings, results on high-$\\textit{p}_\\text{T}$ particle\nproduction measured by ALICE in Pb-Pb collisions at $\n\\sqrt{\\text{s}_\\text{NN}}\\, = 5.02\\ \\rm{TeV}$ as well as well in pp at\n$\\sqrt{\\text{s}}\\,=5.02\\ \\rm{TeV}$ are presented for the first time. The\nnuclear modification factors ($\\text{R}_\\text{AA}$) in Pb-Pb collisions are\npresented and compared with model calculations.\n", "  Multipartite entanglement and nonclassicality of four-mode Gaussian states\ngenerated in two simultaneous nonlinear processes involving parametric\ndown-conversion and frequency up-conversion are analyzed assuming the vacuum as\nthe initial state. Suitable conditions for the generation of highly entangled\nstates are found. Transfer of the entanglement from the down-converted modes\ninto the up-converted ones is also suggested. The analysis of the whole set of\nstates reveals that sub-shot-noise intensity correlations between the\nequally-populated down-converted modes, as well as the equally-populated\nup-converted modes, uniquely identify entangled states. They represent a\npowerful entanglement identifier also in other cases with arbitrarily populated\nmodes.\n", "  In 2012, a pedagogic tool for monochromatic holography was realized for\npedagogic and popular science purposes [Th. Voslion and A. Escarguel, Eur. J.\nPhys 33, 1803 (2012)]. Following its success, we decided to upgrade it to make\nlarger colour holograms and new pedagogic experiments. The resulting kit\nincludes all the necessary equipment to produce 4 \"x 5\" colour holograms with a\nsimple optical assembly and with an excellent vibration tolerance. The\nresulting holograms, in colour and bigger, are much more spectacular for\nscience outreach purposes. For teaching purposes, some of the existing\nexperiments have been upgraded, and new ones have been developed for university\nstudents and continuing education of teachers: colour reflection Denisyuk\nholograms, single shot transmission/reflection holograms, angular and\nwavelength multiplexing, holographic diffraction gratings with improved setup.\n", "  Let $\\Omega$ be a smooth bounded axisymmetric set in $\\R^3$. In this paper we\ninvestigate the existence of minimizers of the so-called neo-Hookean energy\namong a class of axisymmetric maps. Due to the appearance of a critical\nexponent in the energy we must face a problem of lack of compactness. Indeed as\nshown by an example of Conti-De Lellis, a phenomenon of concentration of energy\ncan occur preventing the strong convergence in $W^{1,2}(\\Omega,\\mathbb{R}^3)$\nof a minimizing sequence along with the equi-integrability of the cofactors of\nthat sequence. We prove that this phenomenon can only take place on the axis of\nsymmetry of the domain. Thus if we consider domains that do not contain the\naxis of symmetry then minimizers do exist. We also provide a partial\ndescription of the lack of compactness in terms of Cartesian currents. Then we\nstudy the case where $\\Omega$ is not necessarily axisymmetric but the boundary\ndata is affine. In that case if we do not allow cavitation (nor in the interior\nneither at the boundary) then the affine extension is the unique minimizer,\nthat is, quadratic polyconvex energies are $W^{1,2}$-quasiconvex in our\nadmissible space. At last, in the case of an axisymmetric domain not containing\nits symmetry axis, we obtain for the first time the existence of weak solutions\nof the energy-momentum equations for $3$D neo-Hookean materials.\n", "  During hurricane seasons, emergency managers and other decision makers need\naccurate and `on-time' information on potential storm surge impacts. Fully\ndynamical computer models, such as the ADCIRC tide, storm surge, and wind-wave\nmodel take several hours to complete a forecast when configured at high spatial\nresolution. Additionally, statically meaningful ensembles of high-resolution\nmodels (needed for uncertainty estimation) cannot easily be computed in near\nreal-time. This paper discusses an artificial neural network model for storm\nsurge prediction in North Carolina. The network model provides fast, real-time\nstorm surge estimates at coastal locations in North Carolina. The paper studies\nthe performance of the neural network model vs. other models on synthetic and\nreal hurricane data.\n", "  Ehrenfest's theorem in the infinite square well is up to now only manifested\nindirectly. The manifestation of this theorem is first done in the finite\nsquare well, and then consider the infinite square well as the limit of the\nfinite well. For a direct manifestation, we need a more precise formula to\ndescribe the degree of infiniteness of the divergent potential energy. We show\nthat the potential energy term term, which is the product of the potential\nenergy and the energy eigenfunction, is a well defined function which can be\nexpressed in terms of Dirac delta functions. This means that the infinity in\nthis model is not that vague but has obtained a specification. This results\nthat expectation values can be calculated precisely and Ehrenfest's thereom can\nbe confirmed directly.\n", "  Using the linearized DC power flow model, we study cascading failures and\ntheir spatial and temporal properties in the US Western Interconnect (USWI)\npower grid. We also introduce the preferential Degree And Distance Attachment\n(DADA) model, with similar degree distributions, resistances, and currents to\nthe USWI. We investigate the behavior of both grids resulting from the failure\nof a single line. We find that the DADA model and the USWI model react very\nsimilarly to that failure, and that their blackout characteristics resemble\neach other. In many cases, the failure of a single line can cause cascading\nfailures, which impact the entire grid. We characterize the resilience of the\ngrid by three parameters, the most important of which is tolerance ${\\alpha}$,\nwhich is the ratio of the maximal load a line can carry to its initial load. We\ncharacterize a blackout by its yield, which we define as the ratio of the final\nto the initial consumed currents. We find that if ${\\alpha}\\leq2$, the\nprobability of a large blackout occurring is very small. By contrast, in a\nbroad range of $1 < {\\alpha} < 2$, the initial failure of a single line can\nresult, with a high probability, in cascading failures leading to a massive\nblackout with final yield less than 80%. The yield has a bimodal distribution\ntypical of a first-order transition, i.e., the failure of a randomly selected\nline leads either to an insignificant current reduction or to a major blackout.\nWe find that there is a latent period in the development of major blackouts\nduring which few lines are overloaded, and the yield remains high. The duration\nof this latent period is proportional to the tolerance. The existence of the\nlatent period suggests that intervention during early time steps of a cascade\ncan significantly reduce the risk of a major blackout.\n", "  Type II optical parametric oscillators are amongst the highest-quality\nsources of quantum-correlated light. In particular, when pumped above\nthreshold, such devices generate a pair of bright orthogonally-polarized beams\nwith strong continuous-variable entanglement. However, these sources are of\nlimited practical use, because the entangled beams emerge with different\nfrequencies and a diffusing phase-difference. It has been proven that the use\nof an internal wave-plate coupling the modes with orthogonal polarization is\ncapable of locking the frequencies of the emerging beams to half the pump\nfrequency, as well as reducing the phase-difference diffusion, at the expense\nof reducing the entanglement levels. In this work we characterize theoretically\nan alternative locking mechanism: the injection of a laser at half the pump\nfrequency. Apart from being less invasive, this method should allow for an\neasier real-time experimental control. We show that such an injection is\ncapable of generating the desired phase locking between the emerging beams,\nwhile still allowing for large levels of entanglement. Moreover, we find an\nadditional region of the parameter space (at relatively large injections) where\na mode with well defined polarization is in a highly squeezed vacuum state.\n", "  I present new results and updates for total cross sections and differential\ndistributions in top-antitop pair and single-top production. Soft-gluon\ncorrections are added to exact fixed-order results to provide the best\npredictions at approximate N$^3$LO for $t{\\bar t}$ production and approximate\nNNLO for single-top production. Total cross sections and top-quark\ntransverse-momentum and rapidity distributions are presented and compared with\ndata at LHC and Tevatron energies. The cusp anomalous dimension at three and\nhigher loops is also discussed.\n", "  We theoretically consider the possibility of generating nonlinear transverse\npatterns in an optomechanical system in which the mechanical element is a\nmicrostructured oscillating end-mirrror consisting in an array of\nweakly-coupled micromirrors. While in the limit of large number of\nmicro-mirrors we naturally recover the continuous model that we recently\nstudied in [Ruiz-Rivas et al., Phys. Rev. A 93, 033850 (2015)], we pay special\nnumerical attention to the opposite limit, showing that the structures\npredicted with the continuous model can be observed for a number of\nmicro-mirrors as low as ten or less. This opens new venues for experimental\napproaches to the subject.\n", "  Simple homogeneous shear flows of frictionless, deformable particles are\nstudied by particle simulations at large shear rates and for differently soft,\ndeformable particles. The particle stiffness sets a time-scale that can be used\nto scale the physical quantities; thus the dimensionless shear rate, i.e. the\ninertial number (inversely proportional to pressure), can alternatively be\nexpressed as inversely proportional to the square root of the particle\nstiffness. Asymptotic scaling relations for the field variables pressure, shear\nstress and granular temperature are inferred from simulations in both fluid and\nsolid regimes, corresponding to unjammed and jammed conditions. Then the limit\ncases are merged to unique constitutive relations that cover also the\ntransition zone in proximity of jamming. By exploiting the diverging behavior\nof the scaling laws at the jamming density, we arrive at continuous and\ndifferentiable phenomenological constitutive relations for the stresses and the\ngranular temperature as functions of the volume fraction, shear rate, particle\nstiffness and distance from jamming. In contrast to steady shear flows of hard\nparticles the (shear) stress ratio does not collapse as a function of the\ninertial number, indicating the need for an additional control parameter. In\nthe range of particle stiffnesses investigated, in the solid regime, only the\npressure is rate independent, whereas the shear stress exhibits a slight shear\nrate- and stiffness-dependency.\n", "  During last years theoretical works shed new light and proposed new\nhypothesis on the mechanisms which regulate the time behaviour of biological\npopulations in different natural systems. Despite of this, the role of\nenvironmental variables in ecological systems is still an open question.\nFilling this gap of knowledge is a crucial task for a deeper comprehension of\nthe dynamics of biological populations in real ecosystems. In this work we\nstudy how the dynamics of food spoilage bacteria influences the sensory\ncharacteristics of fresh fish specimens. This topic is crucial for a better\nunderstanding of the role played by the bacterial growth on the organoleptic\nproperties, and for the quality evaluation and risk assessment of food\nproducts. We therefore analyze the time behaviour, in fresh fish specimens, of\nsensory characteristics starting from the growth curves of two spoilage\nbacterial communities. The theoretical study, initially based on a\ndeterministic model, exploits experimental temperature profiles. As a first\nstep, a model of predictive microbiology is used to reproduce the experimental\nbehaviour of the two bacterial populations. Afterwards, the theoretical\nbacterial growths are converted, through suitable differential equations, into\n\"sensory\" scores, based on the Quality Index Method (QIM), a scoring system for\nfreshness and quality sensory estimation of fishery products. As a third step,\nthe theoretical curves of QIM scores are compared with the experimental data\nobtained by sensory analysis. Finally, the differential equations for QIM\nscores are modified by adding terms of multiplicative white noise, which mimics\nthe effects of uncertainty and variability in sensory analysis. A better\nagreement between experimental and theoretical QIM scores is observed, in some\ncases, in the presence of suitable values of noise intensity respect to the\ndeterministic analysis.\n", "  In the framework of J-bundles a vielbein formulation of unified\nEinstein-Maxwell theory is proposed. In the resulting scheme, field equations\nmatching the gravitational and electromagnetic fields are derived by\nconstraining a five-dimensional variational principle. No dynamical scalar\nfield is involved.\n", "  A new variational principle for General Relativity, based on an action\nfunctional $I\\/(\\Phi,\\nabla)\\/$ involving both the metric $\\Phi\\/$ and the\nconnection $\\nabla\\/$ as independent, \\emph{unconstrained\\/} degrees of freedom\nis presented. The extremals of $I\\/$ are seen to be pairs $\\/(\\Phi,\\nabla)\\/$\nin which $\\Phi\\/$ is a Ricci flat metric, and $\\nabla\\/$ is the associated\nRiemannian connection. An application to Kaluza's theory of interacting\ngravitational and electromagnetic fields is discussed.\n", "  In this paper the mono-layer graphene at the charge neutrality point is\nconsidered whithin Thomas-Fermi-Dirac theory, treating inhomogeneous external\npotentials and electron-electron interactions on equal footing. We present some\ngeneral considerations concerning the probability measure of the ground state\ncharge density. The system shows degrees of self-similarity. By analyzing the\nground state carrier density profile, we show that although it is not Gaussian,\nthe critical exponents are consistent with Kondev hyper-scaling relations.\nUsing Schramm-Loewner (SLE) evolution we show that the ungated graphene has\nconformal invariance and the random zero-charge density contours are\nSLE$_{\\kappa}$ with $\\kappa=1.8\\pm 0.2$.\n", "  On a finite connected metric graph, we establish upper bounds for the\neigenvalues of the Laplacian. These bounds depend on the length, the Betti\nnumber, and the number of pendant vertices. For trees, these estimates are\nsharp. We also establish sharp upper bounds for the spectral gap of the\ncomplete graph $K_4$. The proofs are based on estimates for eigenvalues on\ngraphs with Dirichlet conditions imposed at the pendant vertices.\n", "  Recently, in Sci. Rep. \\textbf{6} (2016) 28767, Li et al., have proposed a\nscheme for quantum key distribution using Bell states. This comment provides a\nproof that the proposed scheme of Li et al., is insecure as it involves leakage\nof information. Further, it is also shown that all the error rates computed in\nthe Li et al.'s paper are incorrect as the authors failed to recognize the fact\nthat any eavesdropping effort will lead to entanglement swapping. Finally, it\nis established that Li et al.'s scheme can be viewed as an incrementally (but\nincorrectly)modified version of the existing schemes based on Goldenberg\nVaidman (GV) subroutine.\n", "  Oscillations in the B0_s - anti-B0_s system were studied in events selected\nfrom about 4.3 million hadronic Z^0 decays registered by DELPHI between 1992\nand 2000. This paper presents updates of two published analyses ([11,12]). The\nfirst analysis, which utilizes leptons emitted with large momentum transverse\nto a jet, was improved by means of a better algorithm for the vertex\nreconstuction and a new algorithm for flavour-tagging at production time. The\nsecond analysis, which utilizes D_s-lepton events, was improved by optimizing\nthe treatment of proper time resolution. No signal of B0_s oscillations was\nobserved and limits on the mass difference between the physical B0_s states\nwere obtained to be:\n  \\Delta m_s > 8.0 ps^{-1} at the 95% C.L. with a sensitivity of \\Delta m_s =\n9.1 ps^{-1} in the high p_t lepton analysis and \\Delta m_s > 4.9 ps^{-1} at the\n95% C.L. with a sensitivity of \\Delta m_s = 8.6 ps^{-1} in the D_s-lepton\nanalysis. Previously published results on these analyses are superseed. The\ncombination of these results with those obtained in other independent analyses\npreviously performed in DELPHI (D_s-hadron, exclusive B0_s, inclusive vertex)\ngives: \\Delta m_s > 8.5 ps^{-1} at the 95% C.L. with a sensitivity of \\Delta\nm_s = 12.0 ps^{-1}.\n", "  In this letter we consider the distinctive phenomenology of supersymmetric\nmodels in which the scale of SUSY breaking is very low, \\sqrt{F}= O(TeV),\nfocusing on the Higgs sector and the process of electroweak breaking. Using an\neffective Lagrangian description of the interactions between the observable\nfields and the SUSY breaking sector, it is shown how the conventional MSSM\npicture can be substantially modified. For instance, the Higgs potential has\nnon-negligible SUSY breaking quartic couplings that can modify completely the\npattern of electroweak breaking and the Higgs spectrum with respect to that of\nconventional MSSM-like models.\n"]}
