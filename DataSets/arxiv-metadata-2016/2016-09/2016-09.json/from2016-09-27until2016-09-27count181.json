for as long as\n2000 years - in the use of symbols and in the interplay between natural and\nman-built features. Directionality, both in the sense of succession of elements\nand of orientation of single buildings and tombs, plays a key role in governing\nthe landscape in accordance with the idea of \"cosmic\" order, which was the\nbasis of the temporal power of the pharaoh. Comparing satellite image with\nlocal surveys and using simple web-based instruments for tracing visibility\nlines helps in understanding connections and messages which were meant to be\nclear and obvious in ancient times but may be lost, or forgotten, today. In\nparticular, the prominent role of astronomical and topographical alignments in\nthe planning of successive monuments comes out at sites like Abydos, Giza,\nDahshur and at Western Thebes. The way in which the same symbols and elements\nwere elaborated by the \"heretic\" pharaoh Akhenaten in planning the landscape of\nhis capital at Amarna is also highlighted.\n", "  The megalithic enclosures of Gobekli Tepe (Urfa, Turkey) are the most ancient\nsacred structures of stone known so far, dating back to the 10 millennium BC.\nThe possible presence of astronomical targets for these structures is analysed,\nand it turns out that they may have been oriented, or even originally\nconstructed, to celebrate and successively follow the appearance of a new,\nextremely brilliant star in the southern skies: Sirius.\n", "  We investigate the response of a one-dimensional Bose gas to a slow increase\nof its interaction strength. We focus on the rich dynamics of equal-time\nsingle-particle correlations treating the Lieb-Liniger model within a\nbosonization approach and the Bose-Hubbard model using the time-dependent\ndensity-matrix renormalization group method. For short distances, correlations\nfollow a power-law with distance with an exponent given by the adiabatic\napproximation. In contrast, for long distances, correlations decay\nalgebraically with an exponent understood within the sudden quench\napproximation. This long distance regime is separated from an intermediate\ndistance one by a generalized Lieb-Robinson criterion. At long times, in this\nintermediate regime, bosonization predicts that single-particle correlations\ndecay following a stretched exponential. This latter regime is unconventional\nas, for one-dimensional interacting systems, the decay of single-particle\ncorrelations is usually algebraic within the Luttinger liquid picture. We\ndevelop here an intuitive understanding for the propagation of correlations, in\nterms of a generalized light-cone, applicable to a large variety of systems and\nquench forms.\n", "  Combining theory and certain striking phenomenology we suggest that silicene\nand germanene are \\textit{elemental Mott insulators} and abode of doping\ninduced high Tc superconductivity. In our theory, a 3 fold reduction in\nsilicene $\\pi - \\pi^*$ band width, in comparison to graphene, and short range\ncoulomb interactions enable Mott localization. Recent experimental results are\ninvoked to provide support for our Mott insulator model: i) a significant\n$\\pi$-band narrowing, in silicene on ZrB$_2$ seen in ARPES, ii) a\nsuperconducting gap appearing below 35 K with a large\n$\\frac{2\\Delta}{k_BTc}\\sim$ 20 in silicene on Ag, iii) emergence of electron\nlike pockets at M points, on electron doping by Na adsorbent, iv) certain\ncoherent quantum oscillation like features exhibited by silicene transistor at\nroom temperatures and v) absence of Landau level splitting upto 7 Tesla and vi)\nsuperstructures, not common in graphene but, ubiquitous in silicene. A\nsynthesis of the above results using theory of Mott insulator, with and without\ndoping, is attempted. We surmise that if competing orders are taken care of and\noptimal doping achieved, superconductivity in silicene and germanene could\nreach room temperature scales; our estimates of model parameters, t and J\n$\\sim$ 1 eV, are encouragingly high, compared to cuprates.\n", "  In recent years, different scientific disciplines, from Physics to\nEgyptology, from Geology to Archaeoastronomy, evidenced a series of clues\npointing to the possibility that the original project of the pyramid complex of\nKhufu at Giza included also the project of the second pyramid complex at the\nsame site, that of Khafra. The aim of the present paper is to discuss this\nissue in a systematic fashion and to explore its consequences on the way the\nancient Egyptians conceived and built monuments and entire landscapes during\nthe Old Kingdom.\n", "  Nanomagnets driven by spin currents provide a natural implementation for a\nneuron and a synapse: currents allow convenient summation of multiple inputs,\nwhile the magnet provides the threshold function. The objective of this paper\nis to explore the possibility of a hardware neural network (HNN) implementation\nusing a spin switch (SS) as its basic building block. SS is a recently proposed\ndevice based on established technology with a transistor-like gain and\ninput-output isolation. This allows neural networks to be constructed with\npurely passive interconnections without intervening clocks or amplifiers. The\nweights for the neural network are conveniently adjusted through analog\nvoltages that can be stored in a non-volatile manner in an underlying CMOS\nlayer using a floating gate low dropout voltage regulator. The operation of a\nmulti-layer SS neural network designed for character recognition is\ndemonstrated using a standard simulation model based on coupled\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equations, one for each magnet in the network.\n", "  Electroweak observables are highly sensitive to the loop corrections.\nTherefore, a proper gauge-fixing mechanism is always needed to define the\npropagators which are involved in Feynman loop amplitude. With this spirit we\ncompute gauge-fixing mechanism in five dimensional (5-D) Universal\nExtra-Dimensional (UED) model with boundary localised terms (BLTs). These BLTs\nare not 5-D operators in four-dimensional (4-D) effective theory but some sort\nof boundary conditions on the respective fields at the fixed points of\n$S^1/Z_2$ orbifold. Furthermore, these BLTs non-trivially modify the\nKaluza-Klein (KK) spectra and some of the interactions among the KK-excitations\ncompared to the minimal UED (mUED), in which, these BLTs are absent. In this\nnote we calculate the gauge-fixing mechanism in the electroweak sector of such\nnon-trivial UED scenario. Moreover, we discuss the composition and masses of\nGoldstone and any physical scalar that emerge after the symmetry breaking in\nthis set up with different choices of gauge.\n", "  Graphene and other two-dimensional crystals can be combined to form various\nhybrids and heterostructures, creating materials on demand, in which the\ninterlayer coupling at the interface leads to modified physical properties as\ncompared to their constituents. Here, by measuring Raman spectra of shear\nmodes, we probe the coupling at the interface between two artificially-stacked\nfew-layer graphenes rotated with respect to each other. The strength of\ninterlayer coupling between the two interface layers is found to be only 20% of\nthat between Bernal-stacked layers. Nevertheless, this weak coupling manifests\nitself in a Davydov splitting of the shear mode frequencies in systems\nconsisting of two equivalent graphene multilayers, and in the intensity\nenhancement of shear modes due to the optical resonance with several optically\nallowed electronic transitions between conduction and valence bands in the band\nstructures. This study paves way for fundamental understanding into the\ninterface coupling of two-dimensional hybrids and heterostructures.\n", "  The possibility of an emergent universe solution to Einstein's field\nequations allowing for an irreversible creation of matter at the expense of the\ngravitational field is shown. With the universe being chosen as spatially flat\nFRW spacetime together with equation of state proposed in [17], the solution\nexists when the ratio of the phenomenological matter creation rate to the\nnumber density times the Hubble parameter is a number $\\beta$ of the order of\nunity and independent of time. The thermodynamic behaviour is also determined\nfor this solution. Interestingly, we also find that an emergent universe\nscenario is present with usual equation of state in cosmology when the matter\ncreation rate is chosen to be a constant. More general class of emergent\nuniverse solutions are also discussed.\n", "  A logarithmic but divergent term usually appears in the computation of\nentanglement entropy circumferencing a black hole, while the leading quantum\ncorrection to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy also takes the logarithmic form. A\nquench model of CFT within finite Euclidean time was proposed in the\n\\cite{Kuwakino:2014nra} to regard this logarithmic term as entanglement between\nradiation and the black hole, and this proposal was justified by the\nalternative sign for $n$-partite quantum information. However, this preliminary\nform suffers from the notorious divergence at its low temperature limit. In\nthis letter, we propose a modified form for black hole entanglement entropy\nsuch that the divergence sickness can be cured. We discuss the final stage of\nblack hole due to this modification and its relation to R{\\`e}nyi entropy,\nhigher loop quantum correction and higher spin black holes.\n", "  The recently discovered Dirac and Weyl semimetals are new members of\ntopological materials. Starting from them, topological superconductivity may be\nachieved, e.g. by carrier doping or applying pressure. Here we report\nhigh-pressure resistance and X-ray diffraction study of the three-dimensional\ntopological Dirac semimetal Cd3As2. Superconductivity with Tc ~ 2.0 K is\nobserved at 8.5 GPa. The Tc keeps increasing to about 4.0 K at 21.3 GPa, then\nshows a nearly constant pressure dependence up to the highest pressure 50.9\nGPa. The X-ray diffraction measurements reveal a structure phase transition\naround 3.5 GPa. Our observation of superconductivity in pressurized topological\nDirac semimetal Cd3As2 provides a new candidate for topological superconductor,\nas argued in a recent point contact study and a theoretical work.\n", "  An efficient algorithm without flux correction for simulation of corona\ndischarges is proposed. The algorithm referred to as the position-state\nseparation method (POSS) is used to solve convection-dominated continuity\nequations commonly present in corona discharges modelling. The proposed\nsolution method combines an Eulerian scheme for the solution of the convective\nacceleration, the diffusion and the reaction subproblems, and a Lagrangian\nscheme for the solution of the linear convection subproblem. Several classical\nnumerical experiments in different dimensions and coordinate systems are\nconducted to demonstrate the excellent performance of POSS regarding low\ncomputational cost, robustness, and high-resolution. It is shown that the time\ncomplexity of the method when dealing with the convection of charged particles\nincreases linearly with the number of unknowns. For the simulation of corona\ndischarges where local electric fields do not change strongly in time, the time\nstep of POSS could be much larger than the CFL time step. These special\nfeatures enable POSS to have great potential in modeling of corona discharges\nin long interelectrode gaps and for long simulation times.\n", "  There is an ever-increasing interest in investigating dynamics in\ntime-varying graphs (TVGs). Nevertheless, so far, the notion of centrality in\nTVG scenarios usually refers to metrics that assess the relative importance of\nnodes along the temporal evolution of the dynamic complex network. For some TVG\nscenarios, however, more important than identifying the central nodes under a\ngiven node centrality definition is identifying the key time instants for\ntaking certain actions. In this paper, we thus introduce and investigate the\nnotion of time centrality in TVGs. Analogously to node centrality, time\ncentrality evaluates the relative importance of time instants in dynamic\ncomplex networks. In this context, we present two time centrality metrics\nrelated to diffusion processes. We evaluate the two defined metrics using both\na real-world dataset representing an in-person contact dynamic network and a\nsynthetically generated randomized TVG. We validate the concept of time\ncentrality showing that diffusion starting at the best classified time instants\n(i.e. the most central ones), according to our metrics, can perform a faster\nand more efficient diffusion process.\n", "  We classify spherical quadrilaterals up to isometry in the case when one\ninner angle is a multiple of pi while the other three are not. This is\nequivalent to classification of Heun's equations with real parameters and one\napparent singularity such that the monodromy consists of unitary\ntransformations.\n", "  Most extreme-mass-ratio-inspirals of small compact objects into supermassive\nblack holes end with a fast plunge from an eccentric last stable orbit. For\nrapidly rotating black holes such fast plunges may be studied in the context of\nthe Kerr/CFT correspondence because they occur in the near-horizon region where\ndynamics are governed by the infinite dimensional conformal symmetry. In this\npaper we use conformal transformations to analytically solve for the radiation\nemitted from fast plunges into near-extreme Kerr black holes. We find perfect\nagreement between the gravity and CFT computations.\n", "  Excitation of a metallic ferromagnet such as Ni with an intensive femtosecond\nlaser pulse causes an ultrafast demagnetization within approximately 300 fs. It\nwas proposed that the ultrafast demagnetization measured in femtosecond\nmagneto-optical experiments could be due to relativistic light-induced\nprocesses. We perform an ab initio investigation of the influence of\nrelativistic effects on the magneto-optical response of Ni. To this end, we\ndevelop, first, a response theory formulation of the additional appearing\nultra-relativistic terms in the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformed Dirac Hamiltonian\ndue to the electromagnetic field, and, second, compute the influence of\nrelativistic light-induced spin-flip transitions on the magneto-optics. Our ab\ninitio calculations of relativistic spin-flip optical excitations predict that\nthese can give only a very small contribution ($\\leq 0.1$%) to the\nlaser-induced magnetization change in Ni.\n", "  There is a longstanding debate about the zero-point term in the Johnson noise\nvoltage of a resistor. This term originates from a quantum-theoretical\ntreatment of the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT). Is the zero-point term\nreally there, or is it only an experimental artefact, due to the uncertainty\nprinciple, for phase-sensitive amplifiers? Could it be removed by\nrenormalization of theories? We discuss some historical measurement schemes\nthat do not lead to the effect predicted by the FDT, and we analyse new\nfeatures that emerge when the consequences of the zero-point term are measured\nvia the mean energy and force in a capacitor shunting the resistor. If these\nmeasurements verify the existence of a zero-point term in the noise, then two\ntypes of perpetual motion machines can be constructed. Further investigation\nwith the same approach shows that, in the quantum limit, the Johnson-Nyquist\nformula is also invalid under general conditions even though it is valid for a\nresistor-antenna system. Therefore we conclude that and a satisfactory quantum\ntheory of the Johnson noise, the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem, must, as a\nminimum, include also the measurement system used to evaluate the observed\nquantities. Issues concerning the zero-point term may also have implications\nfor phenomena in advanced nanotechnology.\n", "  Raman spectroscopy is the prime non-destructive characterization tool for\ngraphene and related layered materials. The shear (C) and layer breathing modes\n(LBMs) are due to relative motions of the planes, either perpendicular or\nparallel to their normal. This allows one to directly probe the interlayer\ninteractions in multilayer samples. Graphene and other two-dimensional (2d)\ncrystals can be combined to form various hybrids and heterostructures, creating\nmaterials on demand with properties determined by the interlayer interaction.\nThis is the case even for a single material, where multilayer stacks with\ndifferent relative orientation have different optical and electronic\nproperties. In twisted multilayer graphene samples there is a significant\nenhancement of the C modes due to resonance with new optically allowed\nelectronic transitions, determined by the relative orientation of the layers.\nHere we show that this applies also to the LBMs, that can be now directly\nmeasured at room temperature. We find that twisting does not affect LBMs, quite\ndifferent from the case of the C modes. This implies that the periodicity\nmismatch between two twisted layers mostly affects shear interactions. Our work\nshows that Raman spectroscopy is an ideal tool to uncover the interface\ncoupling of 2d hybrids and heterostructures.\n", "  We demonstrate that a tensor product structure and optical analogy of quantum\nentanglement can be obtained by introducing pseudorandom phase sequences into\nclassical fields with two orthogonal modes. Using the classical analogy, we\ndiscuss efficient simulation of several typical quantum states, including\nproduct state, Bell states, GHZ state, and W state. By performing quadrature\ndemodulation scheme, we propose a sequence permutation mechanism to simulate\ncertain quantum states and a generalized gate array model to simulate quantum\nalgorithm, such as Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm. The research on\nclassical simulation of quantum states is important, for it not only enables\npotential beyond quantum computation, but also provides useful insights into\nfundamental concepts of quantum mechanics.\n", "  We review and discuss the potential of using measurement-based elements in\nquantum communication schemes, where certain tasks are realized with the help\nof entangled resource states that are processed by measurements. We consider\nlong-range quantum communication based on the transmission of encoded quantum\nstates, where encoding, decoding and syndrome read-out are implemented using\nsmall-scale resource states. We also discuss entanglement-based schemes and\nconsider measurement-based quantum repeaters. An important element in these\nschemes is entanglement purification, which can also be implemented in a\nmeasurement-based way. We analyze the influence of noise and imperfections in\nthese schemes, and show that measurement-based implementation allows for very\nlarge error thresholds of the order of 10\\% noise per qubit and more. We show\nhow to obtain optimal resource states for different tasks, and discuss first\nexperimental realizations of measurement-based quantum error correction using\ntrapped ions and photons.\n", "  Half a century ago, Veselago proposed left-handed materials with negative\npermittivity and permeability, in which waves propagate with phase and group\nvelocities in opposite directions. Significant work has been undertaken to\nattain this left-handed response, such as establishing a negative refractive\nindex in so-called metamaterials, which consist of periodic sub-wavelength\nstructures. However, an electronic counterpart has not been demonstrated owing\nto difficulties in creating repeated structures smaller than the electronic\nFermi wavelength (\\lambda_F) of the order ~ 10 nm. Here, without needing to\nengineer sub-wavelength structures, we demonstrate negative refractive\nbehaviour of Dirac fermions in graphene, exploiting its unique relativistic\nband structure. Analysis of both electron focusing through a n-p-n flat lens\nand negative refraction across n-p junctions confirms left-handed behaviour in\nthe electronic system. This new approach to electronic optics is of particular\nrelevance to the on-going efforts to develop novel quantum devices with\nemerging layered materials.\n", "  A key ingredient of quantum repeaters is entanglement distillation, i.e., the\ngeneration of high-fidelity entangled qubits from a larger set of pairs with\nlower fidelity. Here, we present entanglement distillation protocols based on\nqubit couplings that originate from exchange interaction. First, we make use of\nasymmetric bilateral two-qubit operations generated from anisotropic exchange\ninteraction and show how to distill entanglement using two input pairs. We\nfurthermore consider the case of three input pairs coupled through isotropic\nexchange. Here, we characterize a set of protocols which are optimizing the\ntradeoff between the fidelity increase and the probability of a successful run.\n", "  We show that the Natanzon family of potentials is necessarily dropped into a\nrestricted set of distinct potentials involving a fewer number of independent\nparameters if the potential term in the Schr\\\"odinger equation is proportional\nto an energy-independent parameter and if the potential shape is independent of\nboth energy and that parameter. In the hypergeometric case only six such\npotentials exist, all five-parametric. Among these, only two (Eckart,\nP\\\"oschl-Teller) are independent in the sense that each cannot be derived from\nthe other by specifications of the involved parameters. Discussing the\nsolvability of the Schr\\\"odinger equation in terms of the single-confluent Heun\nfunctions, we show that in this case there exist in total fifteen\nseven-parametric potentials, of which independent are nine. Six of the\ninde-pendent potentials present different generalizations of the hypergeometric\nor confluent hypergeometric ones, while three others do not possess\nhypergeometric sub-potentials. The result for the double- and bi-confluent Heun\nequations produces the three independent double- and five independent\nbi-confluent six-parametric Lamieux-Bose potentials, and the general\nfive-parametric quartic oscillator potential for the tri-confluent Heun\nequation.\n", "  We predict a new mechanism of surface plasmon amplification in\ngraphene-insulator-graphene van der Waals heterostructures. The amplification\noccurs upon the stimulated interlayer electron tunneling accompanied by the\nemission of a coherent plasmon. The quantum-mechanical calculations of the\nnon-local high-frequency tunnel conductivity show that a relative smallness of\nthe tunneling exponent can be compensated by a strong resonance due to the\nenhanced tunneling between electron states with collinear momenta in the\nneighboring graphene layers. With the optimal selection of the barrier layer,\nthe surface plasmon gain due to the inelastic tunneling can compensate or even\nexceed the loss due to both Drude and interband absorption. The tunneling\nemission of the surface plasmons is robust against a slight twist of the\ngraphene layers and might explain the electroluminescence from the\ntunnel-coupled graphene layers observed in the recent experiments.\n", "  Traditionally, chaotic systems are built on the domain of infinite precision\nin mathematics. However, the quantization is inevitable for any digital\ndevices, which causes dynamical degradation. To cope with this problem, many\nmethods were proposed, such as perturbing chaotic states and cascading multiple\nchaotic systems. This paper aims at developing a novel methodology to design\nthe higher-dimensional digital chaotic systems (HDDCS) in the domain of finite\nprecision. The proposed system is based on the chaos generation strategy\ncontrolled by random sequences. It is proven to satisfy the Devaney's\ndefinition of chaos. Also, we calculate the Lyapunov exponents for HDDCS. The\napplication of HDDCS in image encryption is demonstrated via FPGA platform. As\neach operation of HDDCS is executed in the same fixed precision, no\nquantization loss occurs. Therefore, it provides a perfect solution to the\ndynamical degradation of digital chaos.\n", "  A method is suggested for treating the well-known deficiency in the use of\nPade approximants that are well suited for approximating rational functions,\nbut confront problems in approximating irrational functions. We develop the\napproach of self-similarly corrected Pade approximants, making it possible to\nessentially increase the class of functions treated by these approximants. The\nmethod works well even in those cases, where the standard Pade approximants are\nnot applicable, resulting in divergent sequences. Numerical convergence of our\nmethod is demonstrated by several physical examples.\n", "  Ultra-thin Pt films grown on insulating ferrimagnetic CoFe2O4 (111) epitaxial\nfilms display a magnetoresistance upon rotating the magnetization of the\nmagnetic layer. We report here X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD)\nrecorded at Pt-L2,3 and Pt-M3 edges. The results indicate that the Pt magnetic\nmoment, if any, is below the detection limit (< 0.001 {\\mu}$_B$/Pt), thus\nstrongly favoring the view that the presence of CoFe2O4 does not induce the\nformation of magnetic moments in Pt. Therefore, the observed magnetoresistance\ncannot be attributed to some sort of proximity-induced magnetic moments at Pt\nions and subsequent magnetic-field dependent scattering. It thus follows that\neither bulk (spin Hall and Inverse spin Hall Effects) or interface (Rashba)\nspin-orbit related effects dominate the observed magnetoresistance.\nFurthermore, comparison of bulk magnetization and XMCD data at (Fe,Co)-L2,3\nedges suggests the presence of some spin disorder in the CoFe2O4 layer which\nmay be relevant for the observed anomalous non-saturating field-dependence of\nspin Hall magnetoresistance.\n", "  We discuss the introduction of a non minimal coupling between the inflaton\nand gravity in terms of the recently proposed $\\beta$-function formalism for\ninflation\\cite{Binetruy:2014zya}. Via a field redefinition we reduce to the\ncase of minimally coupled theories. The universal attractor at strong coupling\nhas a simple explanation in terms of the new field. Generalizations are\ndiscussed and the possibility of evading the universal attractor is shown.\n", "  Recent improvements in control of quantum systems make it seem feasible to\nfinally build a quantum computer within a decade. While it has been shown that\nsuch a quantum computer can in principle solve certain small electronic\nstructure problems and idealized model Hamiltonians, the highly relevant\nproblem of directly solving a complex correlated material appears to require a\nprohibitive amount of resources. Here, we show that by using a hybrid\nquantum-classical algorithm that incorporates the power of a small quantum\ncomputer into a framework of classical embedding algorithms, the electronic\nstructure of complex correlated materials can be efficiently tackled using a\nquantum computer. In our approach, the quantum computer solves a small\neffective quantum impurity problem that is self-consistently determined via a\nfeedback loop between the quantum and classical computation. Use of a quantum\ncomputer enables much larger and more accurate simulations than with any known\nclassical algorithm, and will allow many open questions in quantum materials to\nbe resolved once a small quantum computer with around one hundred logical\nqubits becomes available.\n", "  We study the optimal Slater-determinant approximation of an $N$-fermion wave\nfunction analytically. That is, we seek the Slater-determinant (constructed out\nof $N$ orthonormal single-particle orbitals) wave function having largest\noverlap with a given $N$-fermion wave function. Some simple lemmas have been\nestablished and their usefulness is demonstrated on some structured states,\nsuch as the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. In the simplest nontrivial case\nof three fermions in six orbitals, which the celebrated Borland-Dennis\ndiscovery is about, the optimal Slater approximation wave function is proven to\nbe built out of the natural orbitals in an interesting way. We also show that\nthe Hadamard inequality is useful for finding the optimal Slater approximation\nof some special target wave functions.\n", "  The present status of the shear-free fluid conjecture in general relativity\nis discussed: a review is given of recent partial proofs, a new and complete\nproof is given for the case of a linear equation of state, including a non-zero\ncosmological constant, and a number of useful results are presented which might\nhelp in proving the conjecture for a general equation of state.\n", "  Many important questions for high-$T_c$ cuprates are closely related to the\ninsulating nature of parent compounds. While there has been intensive\ndiscussion on this issue, all arguments rely strongly on, or are closely\nrelated to, the correlation strength of the materials. Clear understanding has\nbeen seriously hampered by the absence of a direct measure of this interaction,\ntraditionally denoted by $U$. Here, we report a first-principles estimation of\n$U$ for several different types of cuprates. The $U$ values clearly increase as\na function of the inverse bond distance between apical oxygen and copper. Our\nresults show that the electron-doped cuprates are less correlated than their\nhole-doped counterparts, which supports the Slater picture rather than the Mott\npicture. Further, the $U$ values significantly vary even among the hole-doped\nfamilies. The correlation strengths of the Hg-cuprates are noticeably weaker\nthan that of La$_2$CuO$_4$. Our results suggest that the strong correlation\nenough to induce Mott gap may not be a prerequisite for the high-$T_c$\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  We study the sound perturbation of the hydrodynamic vortex geometry and\npresent an exact expression for the resonant frequencies (quasispectrum) of\nthis geometry. Exact solution for the radial part of the covariant Klein-Gordon\nequation in this spacetime is obtained, and is given in terms of the double\nconfluent Heun functions. We found that the resonant frequencies are complex\nnumber.\n", "  Relativistic winds of fast-spinning pulsars have been proposed as a potential\nsite for cosmic-ray acceleration from very high energies (VHE) to ultrahigh\nenergies (UHE). We re-examine conditions for high-energy neutrino production,\nconsidering the interaction of accelerated particles with baryons of the\nexpanding supernova ejecta and the radiation fields in the wind nebula. We make\nuse of the current IceCube sensitivity in diffusive high-energy neutrino\nbackground, in order to constrain the parameter space of the most extreme\nneutron stars as sources of VHE and UHE cosmic rays. We demonstrate that the\ncurrent non-observation of $10^{18}$ eV neutrinos put stringent constraints on\nthe pulsar scenario. For a given model, birthrates, ejecta mass and\nacceleration efficiency of the magnetar sources can be constrained. When we\nassume a proton cosmic ray composition and spherical supernovae ejecta, we find\nthat the IceCube limits almost exclude their significant contribution to the\nobserved UHE cosmic-ray flux. Furthermore, we consider scenarios where a\nfraction of cosmic rays can escape from jet-like structures piercing the\nejecta, without significant interactions. Such scenarios would enable the\nproduction of UHE cosmic rays and help remove the tension between their EeV\nneutrino production and the observational data.\n", "  We derive core-level spectra for doped free-standing bilayer graphene.\nNumerical results are presented for all nine combinations of the doping\nconcentrations $10^{12}\\rm{cm}^{-2}$, $10^{13}\\rm{cm}^{-2}$, and\n$10^{14}\\rm{cm}^{-2}$ in the two graphene sheets and we compare the results to\nthe reference spectra for monolayer graphene. We furthermore discuss the\nspectrum of single-particle inter-band and intra-band excitations in the\n$\\omega q$-plane, and show how the dispersion curves of the collective modes\nare modified in the bilayer system.\n", "  We propose a simplified model to study the possible new heavy diphoton\nresonance from cascade decay of a heavier particle at colliders, which may be\nrelated to the dark matter or other new physics beyond the standard model.\nModel-independent constraints and predictions on the allowed couplings for\ngenerating the observed diphoton data are studied in detail. We demonstrate\nthat this scenario can be tested by the possible four-photon signal or the\n$WW/ZZ/Z\\gamma$ resonances. Meanwhile, this cascade decay scenario also\nprovides us with the dark matter candidates, which is consistent with the\nobserved dark matter relic density.\n", "  A quantum mechanical three-body problem for two identical fermions of mass\n$m$ and a distinct particle of mass $m_1$ in the universal limit of zero-range\ntwo-body interaction is studied. For the unambiguous formulation of the problem\nin the interval $\\mu_r < m/m_1 \\le \\mu_c$ ($\\mu_r \\approx 8.619$ and $\\mu_c\n\\approx 13.607$) an additional parameter $b$ determining the wave function near\nthe triple-collision point is introduced; thus, a one-parameter family of\nself-adjoint Hamiltonians is defined. The dependence of the bound-state\nenergies on $m/m_1$ and $b$ in the sector of angular momentum and parity $L^P =\n1^-$ is calculated and analysed with the aid of a simple model.\n", "  Two-dimensional Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS2) has shown promising prospects for\nthe next generation electronics and optoelectronics devices. The monolayer MoS2\ncan be patterned into quasi-one-dimensional anisotropic MoS2 nanoribbons\n(MNRs), in which theoretical calculations have predicted novel properties.\nHowever, little work has been carried out in the experimental exploration of\nMNRs with a width of less than 20 nm where the geometrical confinement can lead\nto interesting phenomenon. Here, we prepared MNRs with width between 5 nm to 15\nnm by direct helium ion beam milling. High optical anisotropy of these MNRs is\nrevealed by the systematic study of optical contrast and Raman spectroscopy.\nThe Raman modes in MNRs show strong polarization dependence. Besides that the\nE' and A'1 peaks are broadened by the phonon-confinement effect, the modes\ncorresponding to singularities of vibrational density of states are activated\nby edges. The peculiar polarization behavior of Raman modes can be explained by\nthe anisotropy of light absorption in MNRs, which is evidenced by the polarized\noptical contrast. The study opens the possibility to explore\nquasione-dimensional materials with high optical anisotropy from isotropic 2D\nfamily of transition metal dichalcogenides.\n", "  This article gives a review of a recent construction, the ambient\ncosmological metric, and its implications for the global geometry of the\nuniverse. According to this proposal, the universe is a bounding hypersurface\ncarrying a conformal structure and lying at the (conformal) infinity of a new,\n5-geometry which satisfies the Einstein equations with fluid sources. We\ndiscuss our main results about the implied topological nature of the conformal\ninfinity of the ambient metric, the non-existence of spacetime singularities on\nthe boundary, as well as the validity of cosmic censorship as a direct\nconsequence of a new principle on the boundary.\n", "  We study harmonically trapped one-dimensional atoms subjected to an equal\ncombination of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling induced by Raman\ntransition. We first examine the wave function and the degeneracy of the\nsingle-particle ground state, followed by a study of two weakly interacting\nbosons or fermions. For the two-particle ground state, we focus on the effects\nof the interaction on the degeneracy, the spin density profiles, and the\ndensity-density correlation functions. Finally we show how these studies help\nus to understand the many-body properties of the system.\n", "  We show that double-quantum spin vortices, which are characterized by doubly\nquantized circulating spin currents and unmagnetized filled cores, can exist in\nthe ground states of SU(3) spin-orbit coupled Bose gases. It is found that the\nSU(3) spin-orbit coupling and spin-exchange interaction play important roles in\ndetermining the ground-state phase diagram. In the case of effective\nferromagnetic spin interaction, the SU(3) spin-orbit coupling induces a\nthree-fold degeneracy to the magnetized ground state, while in the\nantiferromagnetic spin interaction case, the SU(3) spin-orbit coupling breaks\nthe ordinary phase rule of spinor Bose gases, and allows the spontaneous\nemergence of double-quantum spin vortices. This exotic topological defect is in\nstark contrast to the singly quantized spin vortices observed in existing\nexperiments, and can be readily observed by the current magnetization-sensitive\nphase-contrast imaging technique.\n", "  We consider the transfer of lattice wave packets through a tilted discrete\nbreather (TDB) in opposite directions in the discrete nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nmodel with asymmetric defects, which may be realized as a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate trapped in a deep optical lattice, or as optical beams in a\nwaveguide array. A unidirectional transport mode is found, in which the\nincident wave packets, whose energy belongs to a certain interval between full\nreflection and full passage regions, pass the TDB only in one direction, while,\nin the absence of the TDB, the same lattice admits bi-directional propagation.\nThe operation of this mode is accurately explained by an analytical\nconsideration of the respective energy barriers. The results suggest that the\nTDB may emulate the unidirectional propagation of atomic and optical beams in\nvarious settings. In the case of the passage of the incident wave packet, the\nscattering TDB typically shifts by one lattice unit in the direction from which\nthe wave packet arrives, which is an example of the tractor-beam effect,\nprovided by the same system, in addition to the rectification of incident\nwaves.\n", "  The speed of sound ($c_s$) is studied to understand the hydrodynamical\nevolution of the matter created in heavy-ion collisions. The quark-gluon plasma\n(QGP) formed in heavy-ion collisions evolves from an initial QGP to the\nhadronic phase via a possible mixed phase. Due to the system expansion in a\nfirst order phase transition scenario, the speed of sound reduces to zero as\nthe specific heat diverges. We study the speed of sound for systems, which\ndeviate from a thermalized Boltzmann distribution using non-extensive Tsallis\nstatistics. In the present work, we calculate the speed of sound as a function\nof temperature for different $q$-values for a hadron resonance gas. We observe\na similar mass cut-off behaviour in non-extensive case for $c^{2}_s$ by\nincluding heavier particles, as is observed in the case of a hadron resonance\ngas following equilibrium statistics. Also, we explicitly present that the\ntemperature where the mass cut-off starts, varies with the $q$-parameter which\nhints at a relation between the degree of non-equilibrium and the limiting\ntemperature of the system. It is shown that for values of $q$ above\napproximately 1.13 all criticality disappear in the speed of sound, i.e. the\ndecrease in the value of the speed of sound, observed at lower values of $q$,\ndisappears completely.\n", "  In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. E \\textbf{92}, 012123 (2015)] a modified\n$d$-dimensional $\\Phi^4$ model was investigated which differs from the standard\none in that the $\\Phi^4$ term was replaced by a nonlocal one with a potential\n$u(\\bm{x}-\\bm{x}')$ that depends on a parameter $\\sigma$ and decays\nexponentially as $|\\bm{x}-\\bm{x}'|\\to\\infty$ on a scale $|m|^{-1}<\\infty$. The\nauthors claim the upper critical dimension of this model to be\n$d_\\sigma=4+2\\sigma$. Performing a one-loop calculation they arrive at\nexpansions in powers of $\\epsilon_\\sigma=d_\\sigma-d$ for critical exponents\nsuch as $\\eta$ and related ones to $O(\\epsilon_\\sigma)$ whose\n$O(\\epsilon_\\sigma)$ coefficients depend on $\\sigma$ and the ratio\n$w=m^2/\\Lambda^2$, where $\\Lambda$ is the UV cutoff. We show that these claims\nare unfounded and based on misjudgments and an ill-conceived renormalization\ngroup calculation.\n", "  Solid state magnetic field sensors based on magneto-resistance modulation\nfind direct applications in communication devices, specifically in proximity\ndetection, rotational reference detection and current sensing. In this work, we\npropose sensor structures based on the magneto-resistance physics of resonant\nspin-filtering and present device designs catered toward exceptional magnetic\nfield sensing capabilities. Using the non-equilibrium Green's function spin\ntransport formalism self consistently coupled to the Poisson's equation, we\npresent highly-tunable pentalayer magnetic tunnel junction structures that are\ncapable of exhibiting an ultra-high peak tunnel magneto resistance $(\\approx\n2500 \\%$). We show how this translates to device designs featuring an\nultra-high current sensitivity enhancement of over 300\\% in comparison with\ntypical trilayer MTJ sensors, and a wider tunable range of field sensitivity.\nWe also demonstrate that a dynamic variation in sensor functionalities with the\nstructural landscape enables a superior design flexibility over typical\ntrilayer sensors. An optimal design exhibiting close to a 700\\% sensitivity\nincrease as a result of angle dependent spin filtering is then presented.This\nwork sets a stage to engineer spintronic building blocks via the design of\nfunctional structures tailored to exhibit ultra-sensitive spin filtering.\n", "  We present some predictions for the $\\gamma^\\ast N \\to N^\\ast$ transition\namplitudes, where $N$ is the nucleon, and $N^\\ast$ is a nucleon excitation from\nthe third resonance region. First we estimate the transition amplitudes\nassociated with the second radial excitation of the nucleon, interpreted as the\n$N(1710)$ state, using the covariant spectator quark model. After that, we\ncombine some results from the covariant spectator quark model with the\nframework of the single quark transition model, to make predictions for the\n$\\gamma^\\ast N \\to N^\\ast$ transition amplitudes, where $N^\\ast$ is a member of\nthe $SU(6)$-multiplet $[70,1^-]$. The results for the $\\gamma^\\ast N \\to\nN(1520)$ and $\\gamma^\\ast N \\to N(1535)$ transition amplitudes are used as\ninput to the calculation of the amplitudes $A_{1/2}$, $A_{3/2}$, associated\nwith the $\\gamma^\\ast N \\to N(1650)$, $\\gamma^\\ast N \\to N(1700)$, $\\gamma^\\ast\nN \\to \\Delta(1620)$, and $\\gamma^\\ast N \\to \\Delta(1700)$ transitions. Our\nestimates are compared with the available data. In order to facilitate the\ncomparison with future experimental data at high $Q^2$, we derived also simple\nparametrizations for the amplitudes, compatible with the expected falloff at\nhigh $Q^2$.\n", "  The hints for a new resonance at 750 GeV from ATLAS and CMS have triggered a\nsignificant amount of attention. Since the simplest extensions of the standard\nmodel cannot accommodate the observation, many alternatives have been\nconsidered to explain the excess. Here we focus on several proposed\nrenormalisable weakly-coupled models and revisit results given in the\nliterature. We point out that physically important subtleties are often missed\nor neglected. To facilitate the study of the excess we have created a\ncollection of 40 model files, selected from recent literature, for the\nMathematica package SARAH. With SARAH one can generate files to perform\nnumerical studies using the tailor-made spectrum generators FlexibleSUSY and\nSPheno. These have been extended to automatically include crucial higher order\ncorrections to the diphoton and digluon decay rates for both CP-even and CP-odd\nscalars. Additionally, we have extended the UFO and CalcHep interfaces of\nSARAH, to pass the precise information about the effective vertices from the\nspectrum generator to a Monte-Carlo tool. Finally, as an example to demonstrate\nthe power of the entire setup, we present a new supersymmetric model that\naccommodates the diphoton excess, explicitly demonstrating how a large width\ncan be obtained. We explicitly show several steps in detail to elucidate the\nuse of these public tools in the precision study of this model.\n", "  We present the results of seven Suzaku mosaic observations (>200 ks in total)\nof the nearest non-cool core cluster, the Antlia Cluster (or Group), beyond its\ndegree-scale virial radius in its eastern direction. The temperature is\nconsistent with the scaled profiles of many other clusters. Its pressure\nfollows the universal profile. The density slope in its outskirts is\nsignificantly steeper than that of the nearest cool core cluster (Virgo) with a\nsimilar temperature as Antlia, but shallower than those of the massive\nclusters. The entropy increases all the way out to R_200, which is consistent\nin value with the baseline model predicted by a gravity heating-only mechanism\nin the outskirts. Antlia is quite relaxed in this direction. However, the\nentropy inside ~R_500 is significantly higher than the baseline model, which is\nsimilar to many other nearby low mass clusters or groups. The enclosed gas-mass\nfraction does not exceed the cosmic value out to 1.3R_200. Thus, there is no\nevidence of significant gas clumping, electron-ion non-equipartition, or\ndeparture from the hydrostatic equilibrium approximation that are suggested to\nexplain the entropy and gas fraction anomalies found in the outskirts of some\nmassive clusters. We also present scaling relations for the gas fraction\n(f_gas,200), entropy (K_200), and temperature (T_500) using 22 groups and\nclusters with published data in the literature. The enclosed baryon fraction at\nR_200 is broadly consistent with the cosmic value. The power law slope of the\nK_200-T_500 relation is 0.638+/-0.205. The entropy deficit at R_200 cannot be\nfully accounted for by the bias or deviation in the gas fraction.\n", "  We study the generation of Majorana fermions in a two-dimensional topological\nsuperconductor placed in a transverse magnetic field B. A topological\ninsulator/superconductor heterostructure and a two-dimensional p-wave\nsuperconductor are discussed. It is demonstrated that in these systems a single\nvortex creates two Majorana fermions, one hosted at the vortex core. The wave\nfunction of the second Majorana state is localized in the superconductor volume\nalong a circle of radius $r^* \\propto B^{-1}$ centered at the vortex core. In\nthe case of many vortices, the sensitivity of $r^*$ to the magnetic field B may\nbe used to control the coupling between the Majorana fermions. The latter\nproperty could be an asset for quantum computations.\n", "  We report on thermoelectric properties of nanocrystalline Cr$_{\\rm\n1-x}$Si$_{\\rm x}$ composite films. As-deposited amorphous films were\ntransformed into a nanocrystalline state with average grain size of 10--20~nm\nby annealing during in-situ thermopower and electrical resistivity\nmeasurements. The partially crystallized films, i.e. the films consisting of\ncrystalline grains dispersed in the amorphous matrix, are a new type of the\nheterogeneous material where the nanocrystalline phase plays the role of\nscattering centers giving rise to a large contribution to the thermopower. We\nshow that the thermopower enhancement is related to the energy dependent\nscattering (energy filtering) of the charge carriers on the nanograin\ninterfaces.\n", "  Cross-coupling of ordering parameters in multiferroic materials by multiple\nexternal stimuli other than electric field and magnetic field is highly\ndesirable from both practical application and fundamental study points of view.\nRecently, mechanical force has attracted great attention in switching of\nferroic ordering parameters via electro-elastic coupling in ferroelectric\nmaterials. In this work, mechanical force induced polarization and\nmagnetization switching were investigated in a polycrystalline multiferroic\nBi0.9La0.1FeO3 thin film using a scanning probe microscopy system. The\npiezoresponse force microscopy and magnetic force microscopy responses suggest\nthat both the ferroelectric domains and the magnetic domains in Bi0.9La0.1FeO3\nfilm could be switched by mechanical force as well as electric field. High\nstrain gradient created by mechanical force is demonstrated as able to induce\nferroelastic switching and thus induce both ferroelectric dipole and magnetic\nspin flipping in our thin film, as a consequence of electro-elastic coupling\nand magneto-electric coupling. The demonstration of mechanical force control of\nboth the ferroelectric and the magnetic domains at room temperature provides a\nnew freedom for manipulation of multiferroics and could result in devices with\nnovel functionalities.\n", "  It is shown that the Dirac-nambu-Goto brane can be described as a point\nparticle in an infinite dimensional brane space with a particular metric. This\nsuggests a generalization to brane spaces with arbitrary metric, including the\n\"flat\" metric. Then quantization of such a system is straightforward: it is\njust like quantization of a bunch of non interacting particles. This leads us\nto a system of a continuous set of scalar fields. For a particular choice of\nthe metric in the space of fields we find that the classical Dirac-Nambu-Goto\nbrane theory arises as an effective theory of such an underlying quantum field\ntheory. Quantization of branes is important for the brane world scenarios, and\nthus for \"quantum gravity\".\n", "  In this paper we propose a scale invariant search strategy for hadronic top\nor bottom plus missing energy final states. We present a method which shows\nflat efficiencies and background rejection factors over broad ranges of\nparameters and masses. The resulting search can be easily recast into a limit\non alternative models. We show the strength of the method in a natural SUSY\nsetup where stop and sbottom squarks are pair produced and decay into\nhadronically decaying top quarks or bottom quarks and higgsinos.\n", "  This paper describes the intense software filtering that has allowed the\narXiv eprint repository to sort and process large numbers of submissions with\nminimal human intervention, making it one of the most important and influential\ncases of open access repositories to date. The paper narrates arXiv's\ntransformation, using sophisticated sorting-filtering algorithms to decrease\nhuman workload, from a small mailing list used by a few hundred researchers to\na site that processes thousands of papers per month. However there are\nsignificant negative consequences for authors who have been filtered out of the\nmain categories. There is thus a continued need to check and balance arXiv's\nboundaries, based in the essential tension between stability and innovation.\n", "  We test the DARKexp model for relaxed, self-gravitating, collisionless\nsystems against equilibrium dark matter halos from the Millennium-II\nsimulation. While limited tests of DARKexp against simulations and observations\nhave been carried out elsewhere, this is the first time the testing is done\nwith a large sample of simulated halos spanning a factor of ~ 50 in mass, and\nusing independent fits to density and energy distributions. We show that\nDARKexp, a one shape parameter family, provides very good fits to the shapes of\ndensity profiles, \\rho(r), and differential energy distributions, N(E), of\nindividual simulated halos. The best fit shape parameter $\\phi_{0}$ obtained\nfrom the two types of fits are correlated, though with scatter. Our most\nimportant conclusions come from \\rho(r) and N(E) that have been averaged over\nmany halos. These show that the bulk of the deviations between DARKexp and\nindividual Millennium-II halos come from halo-to-halo fluctuations, likely\ndriven by substructure, and other density perturbations. The average \\rho(r)\nand N(E) are quite smooth and follow DARKexp very closely. The only deviation\nthat remains after averaging is small, and located at most bound energies for\nN(E) and smallest radii for \\rho(r). Since the deviation is confined to 3-4\nsmoothing lengths, and is larger for low mass halos, it is likely due to\nnumerical resolution effects.\n", "  We investigate the cosmological dynamics of interacting Logarithmic Entropy\nCorrected Holographic Dark Energy model with Cold Dark Matter. Fixed points are\ndetermined and their corresponding cosmological models are presented. Moreover,\nthe dynamical properties of these fixed points are derived.\n", "  Photochemical stability of encapsulated films of mixed halide perovskites\nwith a range of MAPb(I1-xBrx)3 compositions (solid solutions) was investigated\nunder accelerated stressing using concentrated sunlight. Evolution of light\nabsorption and the corresponding structural modifications in the films were\nrecorded by UV-vis spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively.\nMAPbBr3 film exhibited no degradation. In MAPbI3 and mixed halide\nMAPb(I1-xBrx)3 films, decomposition of the perovskite material with\ncrystallization of inorganic PbI2, and the corresponding degradation of light\nabsorption, were recorded. Introduction of bromine into the solid solution was\nfound to stress its structure and accelerate the degradation. The relevance of\naccelerated testing to standard operational conditions of solar cells was\nconfirmed by comparison to degradation experiments under outdoor sunlight\nexposure. Reasons for the reduced stability of the mixed halide compositions\nare discussed.\n", "  We develop the inverse scattering transform method for the Novikov equation\n$u_t-u_{txx}+4u^2u_x=3u u_xu_{xx}+u^2u_{xxx}$ considered on the line\n$x\\in(-\\infty,\\infty)$ in the case of non-zero constant background. The\napproach is based on the analysis of an associated Riemann-Hilbert (RH)\nproblem, which in this case is a $3\\times 3$ matrix problem. The structure of\nthis RH problem shares many common features with the case of the\nDegasperis-Procesi (DP) equation having quadratic nonlinear terms (see [Boutet\nde Monvel A., Shepelsky D., Nonlinearity 26 (2013), 2081-2107,\narXiv:1107.5995]) and thus the Novikov equation can be viewed as a \"modified DP\nequation\", in analogy with the relationship between the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV)\nequation and the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation. We present\nparametric formulas giving the solution of the Cauchy problem for the Novikov\nequation in terms of the solution of the RH problem and discuss the\npossibilities to use the developed formalism for further studying of the\nNovikov equation.\n", "  The decohering environment of a quantum bit is often described by the\ncoupling to a large bath of spins. The quantum bit itself can be seen as a spin\n$S=1/2$ which is commonly called the central spin. The resulting central spin\nmodel describes an important mechanism of decoherence. We provide\nmathematically rigorous bounds for a persisting magnetization of the central\nspin in this model with and without magnetic field. In particular, we show that\nthere is a well defined limit of infinite number of bath spins. Only if the\nfraction of very weakly coupled bath spins tends to 100\\% does no magnetization\npersist.\n", "  It's pointed out that the traditional gyrokinetic theory dealing with low\nfrequency electromagnetic perturbation violates the near identity\ntransformation, which is supposed to be obeyed by Lie perturbed transformation\ntheory, if resonance happens between \\omega and k\\cdot v. A modification is\ngiven to overcome this problem by not requiring all components in the first\norder Lagrangian 1-form equaling zero. A numerical example is given as an\napplication of the new theory.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate how the fine structure constant, $\\alpha$,\nlocally varies in the presence of a static and spherically symmetric\ngravitational source. The procedure consists in calculating the solution and\nthe energy eigenvalues of a massive scalar field around that source,\nconsidering the weak-field regimen. From this result, we obtain expressions for\nan spatially variable fine structure constant by considering suitable\nmodifications in the involved parameters admitting some scenarios of\nsemi-classical and quantum gravities. Constraints on free parameters of the\napproached theories are calculated from astrophysical observations of the\nemission spectra of a white dwarf. Such constraints are finally compared with\nthose ones obtained in the literature.\n", "  We study the perturbative and parametric stability of the QCD predictions for\nthe Callan-Gross ratio $R(x,Q^2)=F_L/F_T$ and azimuthal $\\cos(2\\varphi)$\nasymmetry, $A(x,Q^2)$, in heavy-quark leptoproduction. We review the available\ntheoretical results for these quantities and conclude that, contrary to the\nproduction cross sections, the ratios $R(x,Q^2)$ and $A(x,Q^2)$ are stable\nunder radiative QCD corrections in wide region of the variables $x$ and $Q^2$.\nThis implies that large radiative contributions to the structure functions\ncancel each other in the ratios $R(x,Q^2)$ and $A(x,Q^2)$ with good accuracy.\n  Then we consider some experimental and phenomenological applications of the\nobserved perturbative stability. We provide compact analytic predictions for\n$R(x,Q^2)$ and azimuthal $\\cos(2\\varphi)$ asymmetry in the case of low $x\\ll\n1$. It is demonstrated that our obtained results will be useful in the\nextraction of the structure functions from measurements of the reduced cross\nsections. Finally, we analyze the properties of $R(x,Q^2)$ and $A(x,Q^2)$\nwithin the variable-flavor-number scheme (VFNS) of QCD. We conclude that the\nCallan-Gross ratio and azimuthal asymmetry are perturbatively stable but\nsensitive to resummation of the mass logarithms of the type\n$\\alpha_{s}\\ln\\left( Q^{2}/m^{2}\\right)$. For this reason, the quantities\n$R(x,Q^2)$ and $A(x,Q^2)$ will be good probes of the heavy-quark content of the\nproton.\n", "  Star-forming and starburst galaxies are considered as one of the viable\ncandidate sources of the high-energy cosmic neutrino background detected in\nIceCube. We revisit contributions of supernova remnants (SNRs) and hypernova\nremnants (HNRs) in such galaxies to the diffuse high-energy neutrino and\ngamma-ray backgrounds, in light of the latest Fermi data above 50GeV. We also\ntake into account possible time dependent effects of the cosmic-ray (CR)\nacceleration during the SNR evolution. CRs accelerated by the SNR shocks can\nproduce high-energy neutrinos up to $\\sim100$ TeV energies, but CRs from HNRs\ncan extend the spectrum up to PeV energies. We show that, only if HNRs are\ndominant over SNRs, the diffuse neutrino background above 100 TeV can be\nexplained without contradicting the gamma-ray data. However, the neutrino data\naround 30 TeV remain unexplained, which might suggest a different population of\ngamma-ray dark CR sources. Alternatively, we consider possible contributions of\nPop-III HNRs up to $z\\lesssim10$, and show that they are not constrained by the\ngamma-ray data, and thus could contribute to the diffuse high-energy\nbackgrounds if their explosion energy reaches ${\\mathcal E}_{\\rm\nPOP-III}\\sim{\\rm a~few}\\times10^{53}$erg. More conservatively, our results\nsuggest that the explosion energy of POP-III HNRs is ${\\mathcal E}_{\\rm\nPOP-III}\\lesssim7\\times{10}^{53}$erg.\n", "  We investigate the dispersion properties of ridge Bragg-reflection waveguides\nto deduce their phasematching characteristics. These are crucial for exploiting\nthem as sources of parametric down-conversion (PDC). In order to estimate the\nphasematching bandwidth we first determine the group refractive indices of the\ninteracting modes via Fabry-Perot experiments in two distant wavelength\nregions. Second, by measuring the spectra of the emitted PDC photons we gain\naccess to their group index dispersion. Our results offer a simple approach for\ndetermining the PDC process parameters in the spectral domain and provide an\nimportant feedback for designing such sources, especially in the broadband\ncase.\n", "  The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will survey the southern sky from\n2022--2032 with unprecedented detail. Since the observing strategy can lead to\nartifacts in the data, we investigate the effects of telescope-pointing offsets\n(called dithers) on the $r$-band coadded 5$\\sigma$ depth yielded after the\n10-year survey. We analyze this survey depth for several geometric patterns of\ndithers (e.g., random, hexagonal lattice, spiral) with amplitude as large as\nthe radius of the LSST field-of-view, implemented on different timescales (per\nseason, per night, per visit). Our results illustrate that per night and per\nvisit dither assignments are more effective than per season. Also, we find that\nsome dither geometries (e.g., hexagonal lattice) are particularly sensitive to\nthe timescale on which the dithers are implemented, while others like random\ndithers perform well on all timescales. We then model the propagation of depth\nvariations to artificial fluctuations in galaxy counts, which are a systematic\nfor large-scale structure studies. We calculate the bias in galaxy counts\ncaused by the observing strategy, accounting for photometric calibration\nuncertainties, dust extinction, and magnitude cuts; uncertainties in this bias\nlimit our ability to account for structure induced by the observing strategy.\nWe find that after 10 years of the LSST survey, the best dither strategies lead\nto uncertainties in this bias smaller than the minimum statistical floor for a\ngalaxy catalog as deep as $r$$<$27.5. A few of these strategies bring the\nuncertainties close to the statistical floor for $r$$<$25.7 after only one year\nof survey.\n", "  We introduce a coupled-layer construction to describe three-dimensional\ntopological crystalline insulators protected by reflection symmetry. Our\napproach uses stacks of weakly-coupled two-dimensional Chern insulators to\nproduce topological crystalline insulators in one higher dimension, with\ntunable number and location of surface Dirac cones. As an application of our\nformalism, we turn to a simplified model of topological crystalline insulator\nSnTe, showing that its protected surface states can be described using the\ncoupled layer construction.\n", "  Cosmology in Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity is investigated using a\nscalar Born-Infeld field (e.g. tachyon condensate) as matter. In this way, both\nin the gravity and matter sectors we have Born-Infeld-like structures\ncharacterized by their actions and via two separate constants, $\\kappa$ and\n$\\alpha_T^2$ respectively. With a particular choice of the form of $\\dot{\\phi}$\n(the time derivative of the Born-Infeld scalar), analytical cosmological\nsolutions are found. Thereafter, we explore some of the unique features of the\ncorresponding cosmological spacetimes. For $\\kappa>0$, our solution has a de\nSitter-like expansion both at early and late times, with an intermediate\ndeceleration sandwiched between the accelerating phases. On the other hand,\nwhen $\\kappa<0$, the initial de Sitter phase is replaced by a bounce. Our\nsolutions, at late time, fit well with available supernova data-- a fact we\ndemonstrate explicitly. The estimated properties of the Universe obtained from\nthe fitting of the $\\kappa>0$ solution, are as good as in $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmology. However, the $\\kappa<0$ solution has to be discarded due to the\noccurrence of a bounce at an unacceptably low redshift.\n", "  We study how the scalar power spectrum of single-scalar inflation depends\nfunctionally on models with features which have been proposed to explain\nanomalies in the data. We exploit a new formalism based on evolving the\nnorm-squared of the scalar mode functions, rather than the mode functions\nthemselves.\n", "  Many tasks in our modern life, such as planning an efficient travel, image\nprocessing and optimizing integrated circuit design, are modeled as complex\ncombinatorial optimization problems with binary variables. Such problems can be\nmapped to finding a ground state of the Ising Hamiltonian, thus various\nphysical systems have been studied to emulate and solve this Ising problem.\nRecently, networks of mutually injected optical oscillators, called coherent\nIsing machines, have been developed as promising solvers for the problem,\nbenefiting from programmability, scalability and room temperature operation.\nHere, we report a 16-bit coherent Ising machine based on a network of\ntime-division-multiplexed femtosecond degenerate optical parametric\noscillators. The system experimentally gives more than 99.6 % of success rates\nfor one-dimensional Ising ring and nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP) hard\ninstances. The experimental and numerical results indicate that gradual pumping\nof the network combined with multiple spectral and temporal modes of the\nfemtosecond pulses can improve the computational performance of the Ising\nmachine, offering a new path for tackling larger and more complex instances.\n", "  In this study, we investigate the resilience of duplex networked layers\n($\\alpha$ and $\\beta$) coupled with antagonistic interlinks, each layer of\nwhich inhibits its counterpart at the microscopic level, changing the following\nfactors: whether the influence of the initial failures in $\\alpha$ remains\n(quenched (Case Q)) or not (free (Case F)); the effect of intralayer\ndegree-degree correlations in each layer and interlayer degree-degree\ncorrelations; and the type of the initial failures, such as random failures\n(RFs) or targeted attacks (TAs). We illustrate that the percolation processes\nrepeat in both Cases Q and F, although only in Case F are nodes that initially\nfailed reactivated. To analytically evaluate the resilience of each layer, we\ndevelop a methodology based on the cavity method for deriving the size of a\ngiant component (GC). Strong hysteresis, which is ignored in the standard\ncavity analysis, is observed in the repetition of the percolation processes\nparticularly in Case F. To handle this, we heuristically modify interlayer\nmessages for macroscopic analysis, the utility of which is verified by\nnumerical experiments. The percolation transition in each layer is continuous\nin both Cases Q and F. We also analyze the influences of degree-degree\ncorrelations on the robustness of layer $\\alpha$, in particular for the case of\nTAs. The analysis indicates that the critical fraction of initial failures that\nmakes the GC size in layer $\\alpha$ vanish depends only on its intralayer\ndegree-degree correlations. Although our model is defined in a somewhat\nabstract manner, it may have relevance to ecological systems that are composed\nof endangered species (layer $\\alpha$) and invaders (layer $\\beta$), the former\nof which are damaged by the latter whereas the latter are exterminated in the\nareas where the former are active.\n", "  We discuss regular particle arrays as nanostructured front layers for 3rd\ngeneration photovoltaic devices. A rigorous plane-wave method is used to\ninvestigate multi-type particle layers combining different radii and\nconfigurations. The absorbance is enhanced compared to the bare wafer and on\nmixing particles we demonstrate a broadband boost in the absorbance within the\nphoto-active region. Efficiency enhancement in terms of short circuit current\nis studied for varying geometries. Si multi-type layers achieved up to 33%\nimprovement without yet standard anti-reflection coatings. Metal multi-type\nlayers show strong parasitic absorption and boost the absorbance only in narrow\nwavelength regions and no efficiency enhancement is observed.\n", "  The combination of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) with the\nnonlinear interaction between Rydberg atoms provides an effective interaction\nbetween photons. In this paper, we investigate the storage of optical pulses as\ncollective Rydberg atomic excitations in a cold atomic ensemble. By measuring\nthe dynamics of the stored Rydberg polaritons, we experimentally demonstrate\nthat storing a probe pulse as Rydberg polaritons strongly enhances the Rydberg\nmediated interaction compared to the slow propagation case. We show that the\nprocess is characterized by two time scales. At short storage times, we observe\na strong enhancement of the interaction due to the reduction of the Rydberg\npolariton group velocity down to zero. For longer storage times, we observe a\nfurther, weaker enhancement dominated by Rydberg induced dephasing of the\nmultiparticle components of the state. In this regime, we observe a non-linear\ndependence of the Rydberg polariton coherence time with the input photon\nnumber. Our results have direct consequences in Rydberg quantum optics and\nenable the test of new theories of strongly interacting Rydberg systems.\n", "  We discuss novel generalisations of Killing tensors, which are introduced by\nconsidering rational first integrals of geodesic equations. We introduce the\nnotion of inconstructible generalised Killing tensors, which cannot be\nconstructed from ordinary Killing tensors. Moreover, we introduce\ninconstructible rational first integrals, which are constructed from\ninconstructible generalised Killing tensors, and provide a method for checking\nthe inconstructibility of a rational first integral. Using the method, we show\nthat the rational first integral of the Collinson-O'Donnell solution is not\ninconstructible. We also provide several examples of metrics admitting an\ninconstructible rational first integral in two and four dimensions, by using\nthe Maciejewski-Przybylska system. Furthermore, we attempt to generalise other\nhidden symmetries such as Killing-Yano tensors.\n", "  We study full counting statistics of electron tunneling in Coulomb-blockade\nsystems in the limit of short measuring-time intervals. This limit is\nparticularly suited to identify correlations among tunneling events, but only\nwhen analyzing the charge-transfer statistics in terms of factorial cumulants\n$C_{{\\rm F}, m}(t)$ rather than ordinary ones commonly used in literature. In\nthe absence of correlations, the short-time behavior of the factorial cumulants\nis given by $C_{{\\rm F}, m}(t) \\propto (-1)^{m-1}t^m$. A different sign and/or\na different power law of the time dependence indicates correlations. We\nillustrate this for sequential and Andreev tunneling in a metallic\nsingle-electron box.\n", "  We present an eigenspectrum partitioning scheme without inversion for the\nrecently described real-space electronic transport code, TRANSEC. The primary\nadvantage of TRANSEC is its highly parallel algorithm, which enables studying\nconductance in large systems. The present scheme adds a new source of\nparallelization, significantly enhancing TRANSEC's parallel scalability,\nespecially for systems with many electrons. In principle, partitioning could\nenable super-linear parallel speedup, as we demonstrate in calculations within\nTRANSEC. In practical cases, we report better than five-fold improvement in CPU\ntime and similar improvements in wall time, compared to previously-published\nlarge calculations. Importantly, the suggested scheme is relatively simple to\nimplement. It can be useful for general large Hermitian or weakly non-Hermitian\neigenvalue problems, whenever relatively accurate inversion via direct or\niterative linear solvers is impractical.\n", "  Predictions of the elastic scattering, total-inetastic, and total\nproton-proton cross sections, based on a Regge theory inspired tensor-Pomeron\nimplementation of the RENORM model for hadronic diffraction, are compared to\nthe latest experimental measurements at the LHC. The measured cross sections\nare in good agreement within the experimental uncertainties of the data and the\ntheoretical uncertainties of the model, reaching down to the ~1% level.\n", "  We consider the measurement of the trilinear couplings of the neutral Higgs\nbosons in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model~(MSSM) at a high energy\n$e^+ e^-$ linear collider in the light of the discovery of a Higgs boson at the\nCERN Large Hadron Collider~(LHC). We identify the state observed at the LHC\nwith the lightest Higgs boson~($h^0$) of the MSSM, and impose the constraints\nfollowing from this identification, as well as other experimental constraints\non the MSSM parameter space. In order to measure trilinear neutral Higgs\ncouplings, we consider different processes where the heavier Higgs boson\n($H^0$) of the MSSM is produced in electron-positron collisions, which\nsubsequently decays into a pair of lighter Higgs bosons. We identify the\nregions of the MSSM parameter space where it may be possible to measure the\ntrilinear couplings of the Higgs boson at a future electron-positron collider.\nA measurement of the trilinear Higgs couplings is a crucial step in the\nconstruction of the Higgs potential, and hence in establishing the phenomena of\nspontaneous symmetry breaking in gauge theories.\n", "  We discover that a certain deformation of the 1+1 dimensional Poincare'\nsuperalgebra is exactly realised in the massless sector of the AdS3/CFT2\nintegrable scattering problem. Deformed Poincar\\'e superalgebras were\npreviously noticed to appear in the AdS5/CFT4 correspondence - which displays\nonly massive excitations -, but they were there only a partial symmetry. We\nobtain a representation of the boost operator and its coproduct, and show that\nthe comultiplication exactly satisfies the homomorphism property. We present a\nclassical limit, and finally speculate on an analogy with the physics of\nphonons.\n", "  We discuss the Renyi entanglement entropies of descendant states in critical\none-dimensional systems with boundaries, that map to boundary conformal field\ntheories in the scaling limit. We unify the previous conformal-field-theory\napproaches to describe primary and descendant states in systems with both open\nand closed boundaries. We provide universal expressions for the first two\ndescendants in the identity family. We apply our technique to critical systems\nbelonging to different universality classes with non-trivial boundary\nconditions that preserve conformal invariance, and find excellent agreement\nwith numerical results obtained for finite spin chains. We also demonstrate\nthat entanglement entropies are a powerful tool to resolve degeneracy of higher\nexcited states in critical lattice models.\n", "  We consider theoretically the impact of Rashba spin-orbit coupling on spin\ntorque oscillators (STOs) in synthetic ferromagnets and antiferromagnets that\nhave either a bulk multilayer or a thin film structure. The synthetic magnets\nconsist of a fixed polarizing layer and two free magnetic layers that interact\nthrough the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction. We determine\nanalytically which collinear states along the easy axis that are stable, and\nestablish numerically the phase diagram for when the system is in the STO mode\nand when collinear configurations are stable, respectively. It is found that\nthe Rashba spin-orbit coupling can induce anti-damping in the vicinity of the\ncollinear states, which assists the spin transfer torque in generating\nself-sustained oscillations, and that it can substantially increase the STO\npart of the phase diagram. Moreover, we find that the STO phase can extend deep\ninto the antiferromagnetic regime in the presence of spin-orbit torques.\n", "  The dielectric function of heteroepitaxial YBiO$_3$ grown on $a$-Al$_2$O$_3$\nsingle crystals via pulsed laser deposition is determined in the spectral range\nfrom 0.03 eV to 4.5 eV by simultaneous modeling of spectroscopic ellipsometry\nand optical transmission data of YBiO$_3$ films of different thickness. The\n(111)-oriented YBiO$_3$ films are nominally unstrained and crystallize in a\ndefective fluorite-type structure with $Fm\\bar{3}m$ space group. From the\ncalculated absorption spectrum, a direct electronic bandgap energy of 3.6(1) eV\nand the signature of an indirect electronic transition around 0.5 eV are\nobtained. These values provide necessary experimental feedback to previous\nconflicting electronic band structure calculations predicting either a\ntopologically trivial or non-trivial insulating ground state in YBiO$_3$.\n", "  This work refers to the new formula for the superpotential Uikl in\nconservation laws in general relativity satisfying the integral and\ndifferential conservation laws within the Schwarzschild metric. The new\nsuperpotential is composed of two terms. The first term is based on Mollers\nconcept and its a function of the metric gik and its first derivative only. The\nsecond term is the antisymmetric tensor density of weight plus one and it\nconsists of higher derivatives of the metric gik. Although the new\nsuperpotential consists of higher derivatives of the metric gik it might bring\na new evaluation of the conservative quantities in general relativity\n", "  The switching speed and the write current required for spin-transfer-torque\nreversal of spintronic devices such as magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJ)\ncurrently hinder their wide implementation into memory and logic devices. This\nproblem is further exacerbated as the dimensions of MTJ nanostructures are\nscaled down to tens of nanometers in diameter, as higher magnetic anisotropy\nmaterials are required to meet thermal stability requirements that demand\nhigher switching current densities. Here, we propose a simple solution to these\nissues based on synthetic ferrimagnet (SFM) structures. It is commonly assumed\nthat to achieve a given switching delay, the current has to exceed the critical\ncurrent by a certain factor and so a higher critical current implies a higher\nswitching current. We show that this is not the case for SFM structures which\ncan provide significantly reduced switching delay for a given current density,\neven though the critical current is increased. This non-intuitive result can be\nunderstood from the requirements of angular momentum conservation. We conclude\nthat a 20 nm diameter MTJ incorporating the proposed SFM free layer structure\ncan be switched in tens of picosecond time scales. This remarkable switching\nspeed can be attained by employing current perpendicular magnetic anisotropy\nmaterials with experimentally demonstrated exchange coupling strengths.\n", "  An existing conjecture states that the Shannon mutual information contained\nin the ground state wavefunction of conformally invariant quantum chains, on\nperiodic lattices, has a leading finite-size scaling behavior that, similarly\nas the von Neumann entanglement entropy, depends on the value of the central\ncharge of the underlying conformal field theory describing the physical\nproperties. This conjecture applies whenever the ground state wavefunction is\nexpressed in some special basis (conformal basis). Its formulation comes mainly\nfrom numerical evidences on exactly integrable quantum chains. In this paper\nthe above conjecture was tested for several general non-integrable quantum\nchains. We introduce new families of self-dual $Z(Q)$ symmetric quantum chains\n($Q=2,3,\\ldots$). These quantum chains contain nearest neighbour as well\nnext-nearest neighbour interactions (coupling constant $p$). In the cases $Q=2$\nand $Q=3$ they are extensions of the standard quantum Ising and 3-state Potts\nchains, respectively. For $Q=4$ and $Q\\geq 5$ they are extensions of the\nAshkin-Teller and $Z(Q)$ parafermionic quantum chains. Our studies indicate\nthat these models are interesting on their own. They are critical, conformally\ninvariant, and share the same universality class in a continuous critical line.\nMoreover, our numerical analysis for $Q=2-8$ indicate that the Shannon mutual\ninformation exhibits the conjectured behaviour irrespective if the conformally\ninvariant quantum chain is exactly integrable or not. For completeness we also\ncalculated, for these new families of quantum chains, the two existing\ngeneralizations of the Shannon mutual information, which are based on the\nR\\'enyi entropy and on the R\\'enyi divergence.\n", "  The nuclear modification factor is derived using Tsallis non-extensive\nstatistics in relaxation time approximation. The variation of nuclear\nmodification factor with transverse momentum for different values of\nnon-extensive parameter, $q$, is also observed. The experimental data from RHIC\nand LHC are analysed in the framework of Tsallis non-extensive statistics in a\nrelaxation time approximation. It is shown that the proposed approach explains\nthe $R_{AA}$ of all particles over a wide range of transverse momenta but\ndoesn't seem to describe the rise in $R_{AA}$ at very high transverse momenta.\n", "  We investigate universal properties of a p-wave Fermi gas with a resonant\ninteraction in which the axisymmetry is broken spontaneously or externally.\nHere, the short-range correlations can be completely characterized by the\nnine-component p-wave contact tensor, which can be measured by applying a\ngeneralized adiabatic sweep theorem. The distinctive features of the p-wave\ncontact tensor emerge in a normal p-wave Fermi gas in an anisotropic trap and\nin a superfluid phase. An experimental scheme to measure the p-wave contact\ntensor and test the adiabatic sweep theorem is also discussed.\n", "  A reliable comparison of different dark matter (DM) searches requires models\nthat satisfy certain consistency requirements like gauge invariance and\nperturbative unitarity. As a well-motivated example, we study two-mediator DM\n(2MDM). The model is based on a spontaneously broken $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry and\ncontains a Majorana DM particle as well as two $s$-channel mediators, one\nvector (the $Z'$) and one scalar (the dark Higgs). We perform a global scan\nover the parameters of the model assuming that the DM relic density is obtained\nby thermal freeze-out in the early Universe and imposing a large set of\nconstraints: direct and indirect DM searches, monojet, dijet and dilepton\nsearches at colliders, Higgs observables, electroweak precision tests and\nperturbative unitarity. We conclude that thermal DM is only allowed either\nclose to an $s$-channel resonance or if at least one mediator is lighter than\nthe DM particle. In these cases a thermal DM abundance can be obtained although\nDM couplings to the Standard Model are tiny. Interestingly, we find that\nvector-mediated DM-nucleon scattering leads to relevant constraints despite the\nvelocity-suppressed cross section, and that indirect detection can be important\nif DM annihilations into both mediators are kinematically allowed.\n", "  We analyze resonant x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra in Na$_2$IrO$_3$ on the\nbasis of the itinerant electron picture. Employing a multi-orbital\ntight-binding model on a honeycomb lattice, we find that the zigzag magnetic\norder is the most stable with sizable energy gap in the one-electron band\nwithin the Hartree-Fock approximation. We derive the RIXS spectra, which are\nconnected to the generalized density-density correlation function. We calculate\nthe spectra as a function of excitation energy $\\omega$, within the random\nphase approximation. The spectra consist of the peaks with $\\omega$ $<20$ meV,\nand of the peaks with $0.4<\\omega<0.8$ eV. The former peaks are composed of\nfour bound states in the density-density correlation function, and may be\nidentified as the magnetic excitations, while the latter peaks are composed of\nsixteen bound states below the energy continuum of individual electron-hole\npair excitations, and may be identified as the excitonic excitations. The\ncalculated spectra agree qualitatively with the recent RIXS experiment.\n", "  The chiral spin-glass Potts system with q=3 states is studied in d=2 and 3\nspatial dimensions by renormalization-group theory and the global phase\ndiagrams are calculated in temperature, chirality concentration p, and\nchirality-breaking concentration c, with determination of phase chaos and\nphase-boundary chaos. In d=3, the system has ferromagnetic, left-chiral,\nright-chiral, chiral spin-glass, and disordered phases. The phase boundaries to\nthe ferromagnetic, left- and right-chiral phases show, differently, an unusual,\nfibrous patchwork (microreentrances) of all four (ferromagnetic, left-chiral,\nright-chiral, chiral spin-glass) ordered ordered phases, especially in the\nmulticritical region. The chaotic behavior of the interactions, under scale\nchange, are determined in the chiral spin-glass phase and on the boundary\nbetween the chiral spin-glass and disordered phases, showing Lyapunov exponents\nin magnitudes reversed from the usual ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic\nspin-glass systems. At low temperatures, the boundaries of the left- and\nright-chiral phases become thresholded in p and c. In the d=2, the chiral\nspin-glass system does not have a spin-glass phase, consistently with the\nlower-critical dimension of ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic spin glasses. The\nleft- and right-chirally ordered phases show reentrance in chirality\nconcentration p.\n", "  The present work deals with a quintom model of dark energy in the framework\nof a spatially flat isotropic and homogeneous\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. At first, Lie point\nsymmetry is imposed to the system and the unknown coupled potential of the\nmodel is determined. Then Noether symmetry, which is also a point like symmetry\nof the Lagrangian, is imposed on the physical system and the potential takes a\ngeneral form. It is shown that the Lie algebra of Noether symmetry is a\nsub-algebra of the corresponding Lie algebra of the Lie symmetry. Finally, a\npoint transformation in the three dimensional augmented space is performed\nsuitably so that one of the variables become cyclic and as a result there is\nconsiderable simplification to the physical system. Hence conserved quantities\n(i.e, constants of motion) are expressed in a compact form and cosmological\nsolutions are evaluated and analyzed in the present context.\n", "  We report the discovery of 14 Lyman-alpha blobs (LABs) at z~0.3, existing at\nleast 4-7 billion years later in the Universe than all other LABs known. Their\noptical diameters are 20-70 kpc, and GALEX data imply Ly-alpha luminosities of\n(0.4-6.3)x10^43 erg/s. Contrary to high-z LABs, they live in low-density areas.\nThey are ionized by AGN, suggesting that cold accretion streams as a power\nsource must deplete between z=2 and z=0.3. We also show that transient AGN\nnaturally explain the ionization deficits observed in many LABs: Their Ly-alpha\nand X-ray fluxes decorrelate below 10^6 years because of the delayed escape of\nresonantly scattering Ly-alpha photons. High Ly-alpha luminosities do not\nrequire currently powerful AGN, independent of obscuration. Chandra X-ray data\nreveal intrinsically weak AGN, confirming the luminous optical nebulae as\nimpressive ionization echoes. For the first time, we also report mid-infrared\nthermal echoes from the dusty tori. We conclude that the AGN have faded by 3-4\norders of magnitude within the last 10^(4-5) years, leaving fossil UV, optical\nand thermal radiation behind. The host galaxies belong to the group of\npreviously discovered Green Bean galaxies (GBs). Gemini optical imaging reveals\nsmooth spheres, mergers, spectacular outflows and ionization cones. Because of\ntheir proximity and high flux densities, GBs are perfect targets to study AGN\nfeedback, mode switching and the Ly-alpha escape. The fully calibrated, coadded\noptical FITS images are publicly available.\n", "  A measurement of the production cross-section of Z bosons in pp collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV is presented using dimuon and dielectron final states in\nLHCb data. The cross-section is measured for leptons with pseudorapidities in\nthe range $2.0 < \\eta < 4.5$, transverse momenta $p_\\text{T} > 20$ GeV and\ndilepton invariant mass in the range $60<m(\\ell\\ell)<120$ GeV. The integrated\ncross-section from averaging the two final states is\n\\begin{equation*}\\sigma_{\\text{Z}}^{\\ell\\ell} = 194.3 \\pm 0.9 \\pm 3.3 \\pm\n7.6\\text{ pb,}\\end{equation*} where the first uncertainty is statistical, the\nsecond is due to systematic effects, and the third is due to the luminosity\ndetermination. In addition, differential cross-sections are measured as\nfunctions of the Z boson rapidity, transverse momentum and the angular variable\n$\\phi^*_\\eta$.\n", "  Spectra of comet C/2014 Q2 (Lovejoy) were taken with a low resolution\nspectrograph mounted on the 0.5 m telescope at the Mount Abu Infrared\nObservatory (MIRO), India during January to May 2015 covering the perihelion\nand post-perihelion periods. The spectra showed strong molecular emission bands\n(C2, C3 and CN) in January, close to perihelion. We have obtained the scale\nlengths for these molecules by fitting the Haser model to the observed column\ndensities. The variation of gas production rates and production rate ratios\nwith heliocentric distance were studied. The extent of the dust continuum using\nthe Af-rho parameter and its variation with the heliocentric distance were also\ninvestigated. The comet is seen to become more active in the post-perihelion\nphase, thereby showing an asymmetric behaviour about the perihelion.\n", "  We present a consistent renormalization scheme for the CP-conserving\nTwo-Higgs-Doublet Model based on $\\overline{MS}$ renormalization of the mixing\nangles and the soft-$Z_2$-symmetry-breaking scale $M_{sb}$ in the Higgs sector.\nThis scheme requires to treat tadpoles fully consistently in all steps of the\ncalculation in order to provide gauge-independent $S$-matrix elements. We show\nhow bare physical parameters have to be defined and verify the gauge\nindependence of physical quantities by explicit calculations in a general\n$R_{\\xi}$-gauge. The procedure is straightforward and applicable to other\nmodels with extended Higgs sectors. In contrast to the proposed scheme, the\n$\\overline{MS}$ renormalization of the mixing angles combined with popular\non-shell renormalization schemes gives rise to gauge-dependent results already\nat the one-loop level. We present explicit results for electroweak NLO\ncorrections to selected processes in the appropriately renormalized\nTwo-Higgs-Doublet Model and in particular discuss their scale dependence.\n", "  We construct doubled lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theories with discrete\ngauge group $G$ in the Hamiltonian formulation. Here, these theories are\nconsidered on a square spatial lattice and the fundamental degrees of freedom\nare defined on pairs of links from the direct lattice and its dual,\nrespectively. This provides a natural lattice construction for\ntopologically-massive gauge theories, which are invariant under parity and\ntime-reversal symmetry. After defining the building blocks of the doubled\ntheories, paying special attention to the realization of gauge transformations\non quantum states, we examine the dynamics in the group space of a single\ncross, which is spanned by a single link and its dual. The dynamics is governed\nby the single-cross electric Hamiltonian and admits a simple quantum mechanical\nanalogy to the problem of a charged particle moving on a discrete space\naffected by an abstract electromagnetic potential. Such a particle might\naccumulate a phase shift equivalent to an Aharonov-Bohm phase, which is\nmanifested in the doubled theory in terms of a nontrivial ground-state\ndegeneracy on a single cross. We discuss several examples of these doubled\ntheories with different gauge groups including the cyclic group\n$\\mathbb{Z}(k)\\subset U(1)$, the symmetric group $S_3\\subset O(2)$, the binary\ndihedral (or quaternion) group $\\bar{D}_2\\subset SU(2)$, and the finite group\n$\\Delta(27)\\subset SU(3)$. In each case the spectrum of the single-cross\nelectric Hamiltonian is determined exactly. We examine the nature of the\nlow-lying excited states in the full Hilbert space, and emphasize the role of\nthe center symmetry for the confinement of charges. Whether the investigated\ndoubled models admit a non-Abelian topological state which allows for\nfault-tolerant quantum computation will be addressed in a future publication.\n", "  Disordered non-interacting systems are classified into ten symmetry classes,\nwith the unitary class being the most fundamental. The three and four\ndimensional unitary universality classes are attracting renewed interest\nbecause of their relation to three dimensional Weyl semi-metals and four\ndimensional topological insulators. Determining the critical exponent of the\ncorrelation/localistion length for the Anderson transition in these classes is\nimportant both theoretically and experimentally. Using the transfer matrix\ntechnique, we report numerical estimations of the critical exponent in a U(1)\nmodel in three and four dimensions.\n", "  Atomic layer crystals are emerging building blocks for enabling new\ntwo-dimensional (2D) nanomechanical systems, whose motions can be coupled to\nother attractive physical properties in such 2D systems. Optical interferometry\nhas been very effective in reading out the infinitesimal motions of these 2D\nstructures and spatially resolving different modes. To quantitatively\nunderstand the detection efficiency and its dependence on the device parameters\nand interferometric conditions, here we present a systematic study of the\nintrinsic motion responsivity in 2D nanomechanical systems using a\nFresnel-law-based model. We find that in monolayer to 14-layer structures, MoS2\noffers the highest responsivity among graphene, h-BN, and MoS2 devices and for\nthe three commonly used visible laser wavelengths (633, 532, and 405nm). We\nalso find that the vacuum gap resulting from the widely used 300nm-oxide\nsubstrate in making 2D devices, fortunately, leads to close-to-optimal\nresponsivity for a wide range of 2D flakes. Our results elucidate and\ngraphically visualize the dependence of motion transduction responsivity upon\n2D material type and number of layers, vacuum gap, oxide thickness, and\ndetecting wavelength, thus providing design guidelines for constructing 2D\nnanomechanical systems with optimal optical motion readout.\n", "  We provide CTA sensitivities to Dark Matter (DM) annihilation in $\\gamma$-ray\nlines, from the observation of the Galactic Center (GC) as well as, for the\nfirst time, of dwarf Spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). We compare the GC reach with\nthat of dSphs as a function of a putative core radius of the DM distribution,\nwhich is itself poorly known. We find that the currently best dSph candidates\nconstitute a more promising target than the GC, for core radii of one to a few\nkpc. We use the most recent instrument response functions and background\nestimations by CTA, on top of which we add the diffuse photon component. Our\nanalysis is of particular interest for TeV-scale electroweak multiplets as DM\ncandidates, such as the supersymmetric Wino and the Minimal Dark Matter\nfiveplet, whose predictions we compare with our projected sensitivities.\n", "  The magnetoresistance and magnetic torque of FeS are measured in magnetic\nfields $B$ of up to 18 T down to a temperature of 0.03 K. The superconducting\ntransition temperature is found to be $T_c$ = 4.1 K, and the anisotropy ratio\nof the upper critical field $B_{c2}$ at $T_c$ is estimated from the initial\nslopes to be $\\Gamma(T_c)$ = 6.9. $B_{c2}(0)$ is estimated to be 2.2 and 0.36 T\nfor $B \\parallel ab$ and $c$, respectively. Quantum oscillations are observed\nin both the resistance and torque. Two frequencies $F$ = 0.15 and 0.20 kT are\nresolved and assigned to a quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surface cylinder. The\ncarrier density and Sommerfeld coefficient associated with this cylinder are\nestimated to be 5.8 $\\times$ 10$^{-3}$ carriers/Fe and 0.48 mJ/(K$^2$mol),\nrespectively. Other Fermi surface pockets still remain to be found.\nBand-structure calculations are performed and compared to the experimental\nresults.\n", "  In theory, large-scale atmospheric flows, soap-film flows and other\ntwo-dimensional flows may host two distinct types of turbulent energy\nspectra---in one, $\\alpha$, the spectral exponent of velocity fluctuations,\nequals $3$ and the fluctuations are dissipated at the small scales, and in the\nother, $\\alpha=5/3$ and the fluctuations are dissipated at the large\nscales---but measurements downstream of obstacles have invariably revealed\n$\\alpha = 3$. Here we report experiments on soap-film flows where downstream of\nobstacles there exists a sizable interval in which $\\alpha$ has transitioned\nfrom $3$ to $5/3$ for the streamwise fluctuations but remains equal to $3$ for\nthe transverse fluctuations, as if two mutually independent turbulent fields of\ndisparate dynamics were concurrently active within the flow. This species of\nturbulent energy spectra, which we term the Janus spectra, has never been\nobserved or predicted theoretically. Our results may open up new vistas in the\nstudy of turbulence and geophysical flows.\n", "  We review recent developments in two-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$\nsupersymmetric gauge theories focusing on the implementation and applications\nof localization techniques.\n", "  ESO 243-49 is a high-mass (circular velocity $v_{\\rm c}\\approx200\\,{\\rm\nkm\\,s^{-1}}$) edge-on S0 galaxy in the Abell 2877 cluster at a distance of\n$\\sim95\\,{\\rm Mpc}$. To elucidate the origin of its thick disc, we use MUSE\nscience verification data to study its kinematics and stellar populations. The\nthick disc emits $\\sim80\\%$ of the light at heights in excess of\n$3.5^{\\prime\\prime}$ ($1.6\\,{\\rm kpc}$). The rotation velocities of its stars\nlag by $30-40\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ compared to those in the thin disc, which is\ncompatible with the asymmetric drift. The thick disc is found to be more\nmetal-poor than the thin disc, but both discs have old ages. We suggest an\ninternal origin for the thick disc stars in high-mass galaxies. We propose that\nthe thick disc formed either ${\\rm a)}$ first in a turbulent phase with a high\nstar formation rate and that a thin disc formed shortly afterwards, or ${\\rm\nb)}$ because of the dynamical heating of a thin pre-existing component. Either\nway, the star formation in ESO 243-49 was quenched just a few Gyrs after the\ngalaxy was born and the formation of a thin and a thick disc must have occurred\nbefore the galaxy stopped forming stars. The formation of the discs was so fast\nthat it could be described as a monolithic collapse where several generations\nof stars formed in a rapid succession.\n", "  In this paper, we search the dependence of some statistical quantities such\nas the free energy, the mean energy, the entropy, and the specific heat for the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation on the temperature, particularly the case of a\nnon-central potential. The basic point is to find the partition function which\nis obtained by a method based on the Euler-Maclaurin formula. At first, we\npresent the analytical results by supporting with some plots for the thermal\nfunctions for one- and three-dimensional cases to find out the effect of the\nangular momentum. We also search then the effect of the angle-dependent part of\nthe non-central potential. We discuss the results briefly for a phase\ntransition for the system. We also present our results for three-dimesional\nharmonic oscillator.\n", "  The Pentagon Operator Product Expansion represents polygonal Wilson loops in\nplanar $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills in terms of a series of flux tube\nexcitations for finite coupling. We demonstrate how to re-sum this series at\nthe one loop level for the hexagonal Wilson loop dual to the six-point MHV\namplitude. By summing over a series of effective excitations we find\nexpressions which integrate to logarithms and polylogarithms, reproducing the\nknown one-loop result.\n", "  The free-energy barrier of filling a spherical cavity having an inner wall of\nvarious wettabiities is studied. The morphology and free energy of a\nlens-shaped droplet are determined from the minimum of the free energy. The\neffect of line tension on the free energy is also studied. Then, the\nequilibrium contact angle of the droplet is determined from the generalized\nYoung's equation. By increasing the droplet volume within the spherical cavity,\nthe droplet morphology changes from spherical with an equilibrium contact angle\nof $180^{\\circ}$ to a lens with a convex meniscus, where the morphological\ncomplete drying transition occurs. By further increasing the droplet volume,\nthe meniscus changes from convex to concave. Then, the lens-shaped droplet with\nconcave meniscus spreads over the whole inner wall resulting in an equilibrium\ncontact angle of $0^{\\circ}$ to leave a spherical bubble, where the\nmorphological complete wetting transition occurs. Finally, the whole cavity is\nfilled with liquid. The free energy shows a barrier from complete drying to\ncomplete wetting as a function of droplet volume, which corresponds to the\nenergy barrier between the Cassie and Wenzel state of the superhydrophobic\nsurface with spherical cavities. The free-energy maximum occurs when the\nmeniscus of the droplet becomes flat and it is given by an analytic formula.\nThe effect of line tension is expressed by the scaled line tension, and this\neffect is largest at the free-energy maximum. The positive line tension\nincreases the free-energy maximum, which thus, increases the stability of the\nCassie superhydrophobic state, whereas the negative line tension destabilizes\nthe superhydrophobic state.\n", "  In this paper we analyze the quantum phase estimation problem using\ncontinuous-variable, entangled squeezed coherent states (quasi-Bell states). We\ncalculate the quantum Fisher information having the quasi-Bell states as probe\nstates and find that both squeezing and entanglement might bring advantages,\nincreasing the precision of the phase estimation compared to protocols which\nemploy other continuous variable states, e.g., coherent or non-entangled\nstates. We also study the influence of a linear (unitary) perturbation during\nthe phase estimation process, and conclude that entanglement is a useful\nresource in this case as well.\n", "  Multilayer graphene (MLG) grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a\npromising material for electronic and optoelectronic devices. Understanding the\nstacking configuration and interlayer coupling of MLGs is technologically\nrelevant and of importance for the device applications. Here, we reported a\nkind of twisted MLGs (tMLGs), which are formed by stacking one graphene\nmonolayer on the top of AB-stacked MLG by rotating a certain angle between\nthem. The twist angle of tMLGs are identified by the twist-related modes, R and\nR'. With increasing the total layer number of N, the observed interlayer shear\nmodes in the tMLG flake always follow those of AB-stacked (N-1)LG, while the\nobserved interlayer breathing modes always follow those of AB-stacked NLG,\nindependent of its twist angle. The layer breathing coupling of the tMLGs is\nalmost identical to that of mechanically-exfoliated tMLGs, which demonstrates\nthe high quality of MLGs grown by CVD. This study provides an applicable\napproach to probe the stacking configuration and interlayer coupling of MLGs\ngrown by CVD or related methods. This work also demonstrates the possibility to\ngrow MLG flakes with a fixed stacking configuration, $e.g.$, t(1+$n$)LG, by the\nCVD method.\n", "  We present Fabry-P\\'erot interferometric observations of the narrow H$\\alpha$\ncomponent in the shock front of the historical supernova remnant Tycho (SN\n1572). Using GH$\\alpha$FaS (Galaxy H$\\alpha$ Fabry-P\\'erot Spectrometer) on the\nWilliam Herschel Telescope, we observed a great portion of the shock front in\nthe northeastern (NE) region of the remnant. The angular resolution of\n$\\sim$1$^{\\prime\\prime}$ and spectral resolving power of R$\\sim$21 000 together\nwith the large field-of-view (3.4$^{\\prime}$ $\\times$ 3.4$^{\\prime}$) of the\ninstrument allow us to measure the narrow H$\\alpha$-line width in 73 bins\nacross individual parts of the shock simultaneously and thereby study the\nindicators of several shock precursors in a large variety of shock front\nconditions. Compared to previous studies, the detailed spatial resolution of\nthe filament also allows us to mitigate possible artificial broadening of the\nline from unresolved differential motion and projection. Covering one quarter\nof the remnant's shell, we confirm the broadening of the narrow H$\\alpha$ line\nbeyond its intrinsic width of $\\sim$20 km/s and report it to extend over most\nof the filament, not only the previously investigated dense 'knot g'.\nSimilarly, we confirm and find additional strong evidence for wide-spread\nintermediate-line ($\\sim$150 km/s) emission. Our Bayesian analysis approach\nallows us to quantify the evidence for this intermediate component as well as a\npossible split in the narrow line. Suprathermal narrow line widths point toward\nan additional heating mechanism in the form of a cosmic-ray precursor, while\nthe intermediate component, previously only qualitatively reported as a small\nnon-Gaussian contribution to the narrow component, reveals a broad-neutral\nprecursor.\n", "  The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 was one of the most significant\ndevelopments of science in the last half century. A simplified history has\nPeter Higgs positing it in the mid-1960s followed by a long wait while\nexperimentalists progressively turned up collider energies until it appeared\nseveral decades later. However, in order for both the hypothesis and the\nexperimental discovery to occur, a vast and complex theory ecosystem had to\nthrive in the years before Higgs's hypothesis and in the years that followed,\nbuilding up to its discovery. It is further claimed that the Higgs boson\nhypothesis was an immoderate speculation, and therefore faith in theory\nargumentation and speculation was mandatory for the discovery program to\nproceed and reach its fulfillment. The Higgs boson could not have been\ndiscovered experimentally by accident.\n", "  In this note, we study Cabello's nonlocality argument (CNA) for three-qubit\nsystems configured in the generalized GHZ state. For this class of states, we\nshow that CNA runs for almost all entangled ones, and that the maximum\nprobability of success of CNA is 14% (approx.), which is attained for the\nmaximally entangled GHZ state. This maximum probability is slightly higher than\nthat achieved for the standard Hardy's nonlocality argument (HNA) for three\nqubits, namely 12.5%. Also, we show that the success probability of both HNA\nand CNA for three-qubit systems can reach a maximum of 50% in the framework of\ngeneralized no-signaling theory.\n", "  The site-diluted compound (Yb$_{1-x}$Lu$_x$)$_4$As$_3$ is a scarce\nrealization of the linear Heisenberg antiferromagnet partitioned into\nfinite-size segments and is an ideal model compound for studying\nfield-dependent effects of quenched disorder in the one-dimensional\nantiferromagnets. It differentiates from the systems studied so far in two\naspects - the type of randomness and the nature of the energy gap in the pure\nsample. We have measured the specific heat of single-crystal\n(Yb$_{1-x}$Lu$_x$)$_4$As$_3$ in magnetic fields up to 19.5 T. The contribution\n$C_{\\perp}$ arising from the magnetic subsystem in an applied magnetic field\nperpendicular to the chains is determined. Compared to pure Yb$_4$As$_3$, for\nwhich $C_{\\perp}$ indicates a gap opening, for diluted systems a\nnon-exponential decay is found at low temperatures which is consistent with the\nthermodynamic scaling of the specific heat established for a Bose-glass phase.\n", "  We report on the progress in the study of a five-dimensional SU(2)\nGauge-Higgs Unification model. In this non-perturbative study, the Higgs\nmechanism is triggered by the spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry. In the\nsame region of the phase diagram, we observe both dimensional reduction and the\nratio of Higgs and Z boson masses to take the value known from experiment. We\npresent the first results on the construction of a line of constant physics in\nthis region, including the prediction for the mass scale of the first excited\nstates of the Higgs and gauge bosons.\n", "  We present a new method for tracing the evolution of BCGs from $z\\sim 2$ to\n$z\\sim 0$. We conclude on the basis of semi-analytical models that the best\nmethod to select BCG progenitors at $z\\sim 2$ is a hybrid environmental density\nand stellar mass ranking approach. Ultimately we are able to retrieve 45\\% of\nBCG progenitors. We apply this method on the CANDELS UDS data to construct a\nprogenitor sample at high redshift. We furthermore populate the comparisons in\nlocal universe by using SDSS data with statistically likely contamination to\nensure a fair comparison between high and low redshifts. Using these samples we\ndemonstrate that the BCG sizes have grown by a factor of $\\sim 3.2$ since\n$z\\sim 2$, and BCG progenitors are mainly late-type galaxies, exhibiting less\nconcentrated profiles than their early-type local counterparts. We find that\nBCG progenitors have more disturbed morphologies. In contrast, local BCGs have\nmuch smoother profiles. Moreover, we find that the stellar masses of BCGs have\ngrown by a factor of $\\sim 2.5$ since $z\\sim 2$, and the SFR of BCG progenitors\nhas a median value of 13.5 $M_\\odot$yr$^{-1}$, much higher than their quiescent\nlocal descendants. We demonstrate that over $z=1-2$ star formation and merging\ncontribute equally to BCG mass growth. However, merging plays a dominant role\nin BCG assembly at $z \\lesssim 1$. We also find that BCG progenitors at\nhigh-$z$ are not significantly different from other galaxies of similar mass at\nthe same epoch. This suggests that the processes which differentiate BCGs from\nnormal massive elliptical galaxies must occur at $z \\lesssim 2$.\n", "  We have investigated a group of unassociated radio sources included in the\n3CR cat- alogue to increase the multi-frequency information on them and\npossibly obtain an identification. We have carried out an observational\ncampaign with the Swift satellite to observe with the UVOT and the XRT\ntelescopes the field of view of 21 bright NVSS sources within the positional\nuncertainty region of the 3CR sources. Furthermore, we have searched in the\nrecent AllWISE Source Catalogue for infrared sources matching the position of\nthese NVSS sources. We have detected significant emission in the soft X-ray\nband for nine of the investigated NVSS sources. To all of them, and in four\ncases with no soft X-ray association, we have associated a WISE infrared\ncounterpart. Eight of these infrared candidates have not been proposed earlier\nin the literature. In the five remaining cases our candidate matches one among\na few optical candidates suggested for the same 3CR source in previous studies.\nNo source has been detected in the UVOT filters at the position of the NVSS\nobjects, confirming the scenario that all of them are heavily obscured. With\nthis in mind, a spectroscopic campaign, preferably in the infrared band, will\nbe necessary to establish the nature of the sources that we have finally\nidentified.\n", "  Following the recent developement of Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM)\nin the visible range by Zheng et al. (2013), we propose an adaptation for hard\nx-rays. FPM employs ptychographic reconstruction to merge a series of\nlow-resolution, wide field of view images into a high-resolution image. In the\nx-ray range this opens the possibility to overcome the limited numerical\naperture of existing x-ray lenses. Furthermore, digital wave front correction\n(DWC) may be used to charaterize and correct lens imperfections. Given the\ndiffraction limit achievable with x-ray lenses (below 100 nm), x-ray Fourier\nptychographic microscopy (XFPM) should be able to reach resolutions in the 10\nnm range.\n", "  A deeper insight into electron elastic scattering off endohedral fullerenes\n$A$@C$_{60}$ is provided. The study accounts for polarization of both the\nencapsulated atom $A$ and C$_{60}$ cage by an incident electron. It is carried\nout in the framework of the combination of both a model and the first-principle\napproximations. A core principle of the model is that the C$_{60}$ cage itself\nis presented by an attractive spherical potential of a certain inner radius,\nthickness, and depth. The main idea of the first-principle approximation is\nthat the polarization of $A$@C$_{60}$ by an incident electron is accounted with\nthe help of the Dyson equation for the self-energy part of the Green's function\nof an incident electron. Calculations are performed for, and comparison is made\nbetween the individual cases: (a) when $A$@C$_{60}$ is regarded as a static\nsystem, (b) when C$_{60}$ is a static cage, but the encapsulated atom is\npolarizable, (c) when both C$_{60}$ and $A$ are polarized simultaneously but\nindependently of each other, and (d), as the most general scenario, when\npolarizabilities of C$_{60}$ and $A$ are coupled. Spectacular similarities and\ndiscrepancies between results of each of the exploited approximations are\ndemonstrated. Revealed features of the overall significant impact of\n$A$@C$_{60}$ polarization by an incident electron on its elastic scattering off\n$A$@C$_{60}$ are demonstrated. Choosing Ne, Xe, and Ba as \"probing\" atoms, the\ndependence of $e + A@{\\rm C_{60}}$ scattering on the size and polarizability of\nthe encapsulated atom is unraveled.\n", "  The structure of social networks is a key determinant in fostering\ncooperation and other altruistic behavior among naturally selfish individuals.\nHowever, most real social interactions are temporal, being both finite in\nduration and spread out over time. This raises the question of whether stable\ncooperation can form despite an intrinsically fragmented social fabric. Here we\ndevelop a framework to study the evolution of cooperation on temporal networks\nin the setting of the classic Prisoner's Dilemma. By analyzing both real and\nsynthetic datasets, we find that temporal networks generally facilitate the\nevolution of cooperation compared to their static counterparts. More\ninterestingly, we find that the intrinsic human interactive pattern like bursty\nbehavior impedes the evolution of cooperation. Finally, we introduce a measure\nto quantify the temporality present in networks and demonstrate that there is\nan intermediate level of temporality that boosts cooperation most. Our results\nopen a new avenue for investigating the evolution of cooperation in more\nrealistic structured populations.\n", "  The scenario of the compressed mass spectrum between heavy quark and dark\nmatter is a challenge for LHC searches. However, the elastic scattering cross\nsection between dark matter and nuclei in dark matter direct detection\nexperiments can be enhanced with nearly degenerate masses between heavy quarks\nand dark matter. In this paper, we illustrate such scenario with a vector dark\nmatter, using the latest result from LUX 2016. The mass constraints on heavy\nquarks can be more stringent than current limits from LHC, unless the coupling\nstrength is very small. However, the compress mass spectrum with allowed tiny\ncoupling strength makes the decay lifetime of heavy quarks longer than the time\nscale of QCD hadronization.\n", "  We present the results on numerical testing of the Boundary Control Method in\nthe sound speed determination for the acoustic equation on semiplane. This\nmethod for solving multidimensional inverse problems requires no a priory\ninformation about the parameters under reconstruction. The application to the\nrealistic Marmousi model demonstrates that the boundary control method is\nworkable in the case of complicated and irregular field of acoustic rays. By\nthe use of the chosen boundary controls, an `averaged' profile of the sound\nspeed is recovered (the relative error is about $10-15\\%$). Such a profile can\nbe further utilized as a starting approximation for high resolution iterative\nreconstruction methods.\n", "  In this lecture, we give a first introduction to neutron stars, based on\nfundamental physical principles. After outlining their outstanding macroscopic\nproperties, as obtained from observations, we infer the extreme conditions of\nmatter in their interiors. We then describe two crucial physical phenomena\nwhich characterize compact stars, namely the gravitational stability of\nstrongly degenerate matter and the neutronization of nuclear matter with\nincreasing density, and explain how the formation and properties of neutron\nstars are a direct consequence of the extreme compression of matter under\nstrong gravity. Finally, we describe how multi-wavelength observations of\ndifferent external macroscopic features (e.g. maximum mass, surface\ntemperature, pulsar glitches) can give invaluable information about the exotic\ninternal microscopic scenario: super-dense, isospin-asymmetric, superfluid,\nbulk hadronic matter (probably deconfined in the most central regions) which\ncan be found nowhere else in the Universe. Indeed, neutrons stars represent a\nunique probe to study the properties of the low-temperature, high-density\nsector of the QCD phase diagram. Moreover, binary systems of compact stars\nallow to make extremely precise measurements of the properties of curved\nspace-time in the strong field regime, as well as being efficient sources of\ngravitational waves.\n", "  This paper is concerned with coherent quantum linear quadratic Gaussian\n(CQLQG) control. The problem is to find a stabilizing measurement-free quantum\ncontroller for a quantum plant so as to minimize a mean square cost for the\nfully quantum closed-loop system. The plant and controller are open quantum\nsystems interconnected through bosonic quantum fields. In comparison with the\nobservation-actuation structure of classical controllers, coherent quantum\nfeedback is less invasive to the quantum dynamics. The plant and controller\nvariables satisfy the canonical commutation relations (CCRs) of a quantum\nharmonic oscillator and are governed by linear quantum stochastic differential\nequations (QSDEs). In order to correspond to such oscillators, these QSDEs must\nsatisfy physical realizability (PR) conditions in the form of quadratic\nconstraints on the state-space matrices, reflecting the CCR preservation in\ntime. The symmetry of the problem is taken into account by introducing\nequivalence classes of coherent quantum controllers generated by symplectic\nsimilarity transformations. We discuss a modified gradient flow, which is\nconcerned with norm-balanced realizations of controllers. A line-search\ngradient descent algorithm with adaptive stepsize selection is proposed for the\nnumerical solution of the CQLQG control problem. The algorithm finds a local\nminimum of the LQG cost over the parameters of the Hamiltonian and coupling\noperators of a stabilizing coherent quantum controller, thus taking the PR\nconstraints into account. A convergence analysis of the algorithm is presented.\nNumerical examples of designing locally optimal CQLQG controllers are provided\nin order to demonstrate the algorithm performance.\n", "  This note is concerned with a modified version of the frequency domain\nphysical realizability (PR) condition for linear quantum systems. We consider\nopen quantum systems whose dynamic variables satisfy the canonical commutation\nrelations of an open quantum harmonic oscillator and are governed by linear\nquantum stochastic differential equations (QSDEs). In order to correspond to\nphysical quantum systems, these QSDEs must satisfy PR conditions. We provide a\nrelatively simple proof that the PR condition is equivalent to the frequency\ndomain $(J,J)$-unitarity of the input-output transfer function and\northogonality of the feedthrough matrix of the system without the technical\nspectral assumptions required in previous work. We also show that the poles and\ntransmission zeros associated with the transfer function of PR linear quantum\nsystems are the mirror reflections of each other about the imaginary axis. An\nexample is provided to illustrate the results.\n", "  We study a stationary wetting problem on rough and inhomogeneous solid\nsurfaces. We derive a new formula for the apparent contact angle by asymptotic\ntwo-scale homogenization method. The formula reduces to a modified Wenzel\nequation for geometrically rough surfaces and a modified Cassie equation for\nchemically inhomogeneous surfaces. Unlike the classical Wenzel and Cassie\nequations, the modified equations correspond to local minimizers of the total\ninterface energy in the solid-liquid-air system, so that they are consistent\nwith experimental observations. The homogenization results are proved\nrigorously by a variational method.\n", "  Here we give a detailed description of MOLS 2.0.The source code and binary of\nMOLS 2.0 are distributed free (under GNU Lesser General Public License) for the\nscientific community.

However, a general model is still lacking to interpret\nwhy these seemingly unrelated systems share great similarity. Through a\ndetailed analysis of natural language texts and simulation experiments based on\nthe proposed 'Hierarchical Selection Model', we found that the existence of\nhierarchies and human's pursuit of top hierarchy lead to the power law.\nFurther, the power law is a statistical and emergent performance of\nhierarchies, and it is the universality of hierarchies that contributes to the\nubiquity of the power law.\n", "  \"MagAO\" is the adaptive optics instrument at the Magellan Clay telescope at\nLas Campanas Observatory, Chile. MagAO has a 585-actuator adaptive secondary\nmirror and 1000-Hz pyramid wavefront sensor, operating on natural guide stars\nfrom $R$-magnitudes of -1 to 15. MagAO has been in on-sky operation for 166\nnights since installation in 2012. MagAO's unique capabilities are simultaneous\nimaging in the visible and infrared with VisAO and Clio, excellent performance\nat an excellent site, and a lean operations model. Science results from MagAO\ninclude the first ground-based CCD image of an exoplanet, demonstration of the\nfirst accreting protoplanets, discovery of a new wide-orbit exoplanet, and the\nfirst empirical bolometric luminosity of an exoplanet. We describe the status,\nreport the AO performance, and summarize the science results. New developments\nreported here include color corrections on red guide stars for the wavefront\nsensor, a new field stop stage to facilitate VisAO imaging of extended sources;\nand eyepiece observing at the visible-light diffraction limit of a 6.5-m\ntelescope. We also discuss a recent hose failure that led to a glycol coolant\nleak, and the recovery of the adaptive secondary mirror (ASM) after this recent\n(Feb.\\ 2016) incident.\n", "  Phantom devices allow the human variable to be controlled for in order to\nallow clear comparison and validation of biomedical imaging hardware and\nsoftware. There is currently no standard phantom for electroencephalography\n(EEG). To be useful, such a device would need to: (a) accurately recreate the\nreal and imaginary components of scalp electrical impedance, (b) contain\ninternal emitters to create electrical dipoles, and (c) be easily replicable\nacross various labs and research groups. Cost-effective materials, which are\nconductive, repeatable, and easily formed are a missing key enabler for EEG\nphantoms. Here, we explore the use of ballistics gelatin, an inexpensive,\neasily-formable and repeatable material, as a putative substrate by examining\nits electrical properties and physical stability over time. We show that varied\nconcentrations of NaCl salt relative to gelatin powder shifts the\nphase/frequency response profile, allowing for selective tuning of the material\nelectrical properties.\n", "  Chiral phase transition in (2+1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics\n(QED$_3$) at finite temperature is investigated in the framework of truncated\nDyson-Schwinger equations (DSEs). We go beyond the widely used instantaneous\napproximation and adopt a method that retains the full frequency dependence of\nthe fermion self-energy. We also take further step to include the effects of\nwave-function renormalizations and introduce a minimal dressing of the bare\nvertex. Finally, with the more complete solutions of the truncated DSEs, we\nrevisit the study of chiral phase transition in finite-temperature QED$_3$.\n", "  Fractal structure of a system suggests the optimal way in which parts\narranged or put together to form a whole. The ideas from fractals have a\npotential application to the researches on urban sustainable development. To\ncharacterize fractal cities, we need the measure of fractional dimension.\nHowever, if the fractal organization is concealed in the complex spatial\ndistributions of geographical phenomena, the common methods of evaluating\nfractal parameter will be disabled. In this article, a new model is proposed to\ndescribe urban density and estimate fractal dimension of urban form. If urban\ndensity takes on quasi-fractal pattern or the self-similar pattern is hidden in\nthe negative exponential distribution, the generalized gamma function may be\nemployed to model the urban landscape and estimate its latent fractal\ndimension. As a case study, the method is applied to the city of Hangzhou,\nChina. The results show that urban form evolves from simple to complex\nstructure with time.\n", "  What is the shape of a uniformly massive object that generates a\ngravitational potential equivalent to that of two equal point-masses? If the\nweight of each point-mass is sufficiently small compared to the distance\nbetween the points then the answer is a pair of balls of equal radius, one\ncentered at each of the two points, but otherwise it is a certain domain of\nrevolution about the axis passing through the two points. The existence and\nuniqueness of such a domain is known, but an explicit parameterization is known\nonly in the plane where the region is referred to as a Neumann oval. We\nconstruct a four-dimensional \"Neumann ovaloid\", solving explicitly this inverse\npotential problem.\n", "  In this paper, we prove that Linearization Stability of Einstein Field\nEquations is a Generic Property in the sense that within the class\n$\\mathcal{V}$ of space-times which admit a compact Cauchy hypersurface of\nconstant mean curvature, the subclass $\\mathcal{V}_K$ of space-times which are\nlinearization stable forms an open and dense subset of $\\mathcal{V}$ under\n$C^\\infty$ - topology. The work is based upon the work of Ebin $[1]$, Fischer,\nMarsden and Moncrief $[2,3]$ and Beig, Chrusciel and Schoen $[4]$.\n", "  We present an analysis of late-time Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera\n3 and Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 observations of the site of the Type Ic SN\n2007gr in NGC 1058. The SN is barely recovered in the late-time WFPC2\nobservations, while a possible detection in the later WFC3 data is debatable.\nThese observations were used to conduct a multiwavelength study of the\nsurrounding stellar population. We fit spatial profiles to a nearby bright\nsource that was previously proposed to be a host cluster. We find that, rather\nthan being an extended cluster, it is consistent with a single point-like\nobject. Fitting stellar models to the observed spectral energy distribution of\nthis source, we conclude it is A1-A3 Yellow Supergiant, possibly corresponding\nto a star with $M_{ZAMS} = 40M_{\\odot}$. SN 2007gr is situated in a massive\nstar association, with diameter of $\\approx 300\\,\\mathrm{pc}$. We present a\nBayesian scheme to determine the properties of the surrounding massive star\npopulation, in conjunction with the Padova isochrones. We find that the stellar\npopulation, as observed in either the WFC3 and WFPC2 observations, can be well\nfit by two age distributions with mean ages: ~6.3 Myr and ~50 Myr. The stellar\npopulation is clearly dominated by the younger age solution (by factors of 3.5\nand 5.7 from the WFPC2 and WFC3 observations, respectively), which corresponds\nto the lifetime of a star with $M_{ZAMS} \\sim 30M_{\\odot}$. This is strong\nevidence in favour of the hypothesis that SN 2007gr arose from a massive\nprogenitor star, possibly capable of becoming a Wolf-Rayet star.\n", "  The first-order, in terms of electron-interaction in the perturbation theory,\nof the proper linear response function $\\Pi ({\\bf k}, \\omega )$ gives rise to\nthe exchange-contribution to the dielectric function $\\epsilon ({\\bf k} ,\n\\omega)$ in the electron liquid. Its imaginary part, $Im \\Pi_1 ({\\bf k},\n\\omega)$, is calculated exactly.

Many studies have presented the typical features\nassociated to the activity of the nucleus, such as localized dust and gas jets.\nHere we report on series of more energetic transient events observed during the\nthree months surrounding the comet's perihelion passage in August 2015.\n  We detected and characterized 34 outbursts with the Rosetta cameras, one\nevery 2.4 nucleus rotation. We identified 3 main dust plume morphologies\nassociated to these events: a narrow jet, a broad fan, and more complex plumes\nfeaturing both previous types together. These plumes are comparable in scale\nand temporal variation to what has been observed on other comets.\n  We present a map of the outbursts source locations, and discuss the\nassociated topography. We find that the spatial distribution sources on the\nnucleus correlates well with morphological region boundaries, especially in\nareas marked by steep scarps or cliffs.\n  Outbursts occur either in the early morning or shortly after the local noon,\nindicating two potential processes: Morning outbursts may be triggered by\nthermal stresses linked to the rapid change of temperature, afternoon events\nare most likely related to the diurnal or seasonal heat wave reaching volatiles\nburied under the first surface layer. In addition, we propose that some events\ncan be the result of a completely different mechanism, in which most of the\ndust is released upon the collapse of a cliff.\n", "  We study noise induced thermally activated barrier crossing of a Brownian\nparticle that hops in a periodic ratchet potential where the ratchet potential\nis coupled with a spatially uniform temperature. The viscous friction is\nconsidered to decrease exponentially when the temperature $T$ of the medium\nincreases as proposed originally by Reynolds. The results obtained in this work\nshow that the mean first passage time of the particle is considerably lower\nwhen the viscous friction is temperature dependent than that of the case where\nthe viscous friction is temperature independent. We then explore the thermally\nactivated barrier crossing rate of the system in the presence of time varying\nsignal. In this case, the interplay between noise and sinusoidal driving force\nin the bistable system may lead the system into stochastic resonance provided\nthat the random tracks are adjusted in an optimal way to the recurring external\nforce.\n", "  We present the formulation and implementation of the Integral-Screened\nConfiguration-Interaction method (ISCI). The ISCI is a minimal-operational\ncount integral-driven direct Configuration-Interaction (CI) method with a\nsimple and rigorous integral screening (IS). With a novel derivation of the CI\nequations we show that the time consuming $\\sigma$-vector calculation is\nseparable up to an overall sign and that this separability can lead to a\nrigorous IS. The rigorous IS leads to linear scaling in the $\\sigma$-vector\nstep for large systems but can also lead to near linear scaling for smaller\nsystems for the standard CISD, CISDT and CISDTQ methods, where the exponent for\nthe scaling is 1.27, 1.48 and 1.98, respectively, even while retaining an\naccuracy of $10^{-14}$ or less in the energy. In the ISCI the non-relativistic\nCI problem can be broken into 42 generalized-matrix-vector products in the\n$\\sigma$-vector calculation, which can be separately optimized. Due to the IS\nthe ISCI can use dramatically larger orbital spaces combined with large CI\nexpansions, on a single cpu, as compared with traditional CI methods. Further,\nit offers an intrinsic possibility for parallelization on modern computing\narchitectures. We show examples of how IS leads to linear or near linear\nscaling with respect to the size of the simulation box in calculations on the\nBeryllium atom.\n", "  We propose dynamic non-linear equations for moving surfaces in\nelectromagnetic field. The field is induced by a material body with a boundary\nof the surface. Correspondingly the potential energy, set by the field at the\nboundary, can be written as an addition of four-potential times four-current to\na contraction of electromagnetic tensor. Proper application of minimal action\nprinciple to the system Lagrangian yields dynamic non-linear equations for\nmoving three dimensional manifolds in electromagnetic fields. The equations, in\ndifferent conditions simplify to Maxwell equations for massless three surfaces,\nto Euler equations for dynamic fluid, to magneto-hydrodynamic equations and to\nPoisson-Boltzmann equation. To illustrate effectiveness of the equations of\nmotion we apply the formalism to analyze dynamics of macro-molecules and\nmembranes.\n", "  Compensation of intrinsic charges is widely used to reduce the bulk\nconductivity of 3D topological insulators (TIs). Here we use low temperature\nelectron irradiation-induced defects paired with in-situ electrical transport\nmeasurements to fine-tune the degree of compensation in Bi2Te3. The coexistence\nof electrons and holes at the point of optimal compensation can only be\nexplained by bulk carriers forming charge puddles. These need to be considered\nto understand the electric transport in compensated TI samples, irrespective of\nthe method of compensation.\n", "  In the context of higher dimensional braneworld scenario, the stabilisation\nof extra dimensional modulus is an essential requirement for resolving the\ngauge hierarchy problem in the context of Standard Model of elementary particle\nPhysics. For Randall-Sundrum (RS) warped extra dimensional model, Goldberger\nand Wise (GW) proposed a much useful mechanism to achieve this using a scalar\nfield in the bulk spacetime ignoring the effects of backreaction of the scalar\nfield on the background metric. In this article we examine the influence of the\nbackreaction of the stabilising field on the stabilisation condition as well as\nthat on the Physics of the extra dimensional modulus namely radion. In\nparticular we obtain the modifications of the mass and the coupling of the\nradion with the Standard Model (SM) matter fields on the TeV brane due to\nbackreaction effect. Our calculation also brings out an important equivalence\nbetween the treatments followed by Csaki et.al. in \\cite{kribs} and\nGoldberger-Wise in \\cite{GW1,GW_radion}.\n", "  We discuss the effect of the Photon Initiated (PI) process on the dilepton\nchannel at the LHC. Adopting various QED PDF sets, we evaluate the contribution\nproduced by two resolved photons which is not included in the Equivalent Photon\nApproximation (EPA). We compare the PI central value as predicted by the CTEQ,\nMRST and NNPDF collaborations. With the NNPDF2.3QED set of replicas we also\nestimate the PDF uncertainties on the PI central value. We show the effect of\nthe inclusion of the PI contribution and its PDF uncertainties on neutral heavy\nZ'-boson searches. We explore the two scenarios of narrow and broad resonances,\nincluding in the analysis the reconstructed Forward-Backward Asymmetry\nobservable, the latter being less affected by systematics effects.\n", "  This work focuses on non-compact groups and their applications to quantum\ngravity, mainly through the use of tensor operators. First, the mathematical\ntheory of tensor operators for a Lie group is recast in a new way which is used\nto generalise the Wigner-Eckart theorem to non-compact groups. The result\nrelies on the knowledge of the recoupling theory between finite-dimensional and\ninfinite-dimensional irreducible representations of the group; here the\npreviously unconsidered cases of the 3D and 4D Lorentz groups are investigated\nin detail. As an application, the Wigner-Eckart theorem is used to generalise\nthe Jordan-Schwinger representation of SU(2) to both groups, for all\nrepresentation classes. Next, the results obtained for the 3D Lorentz group are\napplied to (2+1) Lorentzian loop quantum gravity to develop an analogue of the\nwell-known spinorial approach used in the Euclidean case. Tensor operators are\nused to construct observables and to generalise the Hamiltonian constraint\nintroduced by Bonzom and Livine (2012) for 3D gravity to the Lorentzian case.\nThe Ponzano-Regge amplitude is shown to be a solution of this constraint by\nrecovering the (opportunely generalised) Biedenharn-Elliott relations. Finally,\nthe focus is shifted on the intertwiner space based on SU(2) representations,\nwidely used in loop quantum gravity. When working in the spinorial formalism,\nit has been shown that the Hilbert space of n-valent intertwiners with fixed\ntotal area is a representation of U(n). Here it is shown that the full space of\nall n-valent intertwiners forms an irreducible representation of the\nnon-compact group SO*(2n). This fact is used to construct a new kind of\ncoherent intertwiner state (in the sense of Perelomov). Hints of how these\ncoherent states can be interpreted in the semi-classical limit as convex\npolyhedra are provided.\n", "  A mechanism connecting ice algal ecodynamics with the buildup of organic\nmacromolecules in brine channels is tested offline in a reduced model of pack\ngeochemistry. Driver physical quantities are extracted from the global sea ice\ndynamics code CICE, including snow height, column thickness and internal\ntemperature. The variables are averaged at the regional scale over ten Arctic\nbiogeographic zones and treated as input matrices at four vertical habitat\nlevels. Nutrient-light-salt limited ice algal growth is computed along with the\nassociated grazing plus mortality. Vertical transport is diffusive but responds\nto pore structure. Simulated bottom layer chlorophyll maxima are reasonable,\nthough delayed by about a month relative to observations. This highlights major\nuncertainties deriving from snow thickness variability. Upper level biota are\ngenerated intermittently through flooding. Macromolecular injections are\nrepresented by the compound classes humics, proteins, polysaccharides and\nlipids. The fresh biopolymers behave in a successional manner and are removed\nby bacteria. In baseline runs, organics are introduced solely through cell\ndisruption, and internal carbon is biased low. Continuous exudation is\ntherefore appended, and agreement with dissolved organic or individual\nbiopolymer measurements is achieved when strong release is coupled to light\navailability. Detrital carbon then reaches hundreds of micromolar, sufficient\nto support physical changes to the ice matrix. Through this optimized model\nversion we address the question, are high molecular weight organics added to\nthe brine network over and above background spillage? The mechanism is\nconfigured for ready extension to the Antarctic, so that global ice organic\nchemistry issues can be targeted.\n", "  Black phosphorus (P) has emerged as a layered semiconductor with a unique\ncrystal structure featuring corrugated atomic layers and strong in-plane\nanisotropy in its physical properties. Here, we demonstrate that the crystal\norientation and mechanical anisotropy in free-standing black P thin layers can\nbe precisely determined by spatially resolved multimode nanomechanical\nresonances. This offers a new means for resolving important crystal orientation\nand anisotropy in black P device platforms in situ beyond conventional optical\nand electrical calibration techniques. Furthermore, we show that\nelectrostatic-gating-induced straining can continuously tune the mechanical\nanisotropic effects on multimode resonances in black P electromechanical\ndevices. Combined with finite element modeling (FEM), we also determine the\nYoung's moduli of multilayer black P to be 116.1 and 46.5 GPa in the zigzag and\narmchair directions, respectively.\n", "  The SiD concept is one of two proposed detectors to be mounted at the\ninteraction region of the International Linear Collider (ILC). A substantial\nILC background arises from low transverse momentum\n$\\mathrm{e}^{+}\\mathrm{e}^{-}$ pairs created by the interaction of the\ncolliding beams' electromagnetic fields. In order to provide hermeticity and\nsensitivity to beam targeting parameters, a forward Beamline Calorimeter\n(BeamCal) is being designed that will provide coverage down to 5 mrad from the\noutgoing beam trajectory, and intercept the majority of this pair background.\nUsing the SiD simulation framework, the effect of this pair background on the\nSiD detector components, especially the vertex detector (VXD) and forward\nelectromagnetic calorimeter (FCAL), is explored. In the case of the FCAL,\nbackgrounds from Bhabha and two-photon processes are also considered. The\nconsequence of several variants of the BeamCal geometry and ILC interaction\nregion configuration are considered for both the vertex detector and BeamCal\nperformance.\n", "  We report direct evidence that magnetically charged superdomain walls form\nspontaneously in two dimensional square artificial spin ice nanostructures in\nresponse to external magnetic fields. These extended magnetic defects were\nrevealed by the development of internal structure, which varies as a function\nof applied magnetic field, within the Bragg peaks of resonant soft x-ray\nmagnetic scattering patterns. Magnetically charged superdomain walls extend\nover tens of lattice sites and do not necessarily align with the applied field.\nOur results illustrate a novel approach to detect hierarchical magnetic\nstructures within spin textures.\n", "  Multiferroics have received intense attention due to their great application\npotential in multi-state information storage devices and new types of sensors.\nCoupling among ferroic orders such as ferroelectricity, (anti-)ferromagnetism,\nferroelasticity, etc. will enable dynamic interaction between these ordering\nparameters. Direct visualization of such coupling behaviour in single phase\nmultiferroic materials is highly desirable for both applications and\nfundamental study. Manipulation of both ferroelectric and magnetic domains of\nBi5Ti3FeO15 thin film using electric field and external mechanical force is\nreported, which confirms the magnetoelectric coupling in Bi5Ti3FeO15, indicates\nthe electric and magnetic orders are coupled through ferroelasticity. Due to\nthe anisotropic relaxation of ferroelastic strain, the back-switching of\nout-of-plane electric domains is not as obvious as in-plane. An inevitable\ndestabilization of the coupling between elastic and magnetic ordering happens\nbecause of the elastic strain relaxation, which result in a subsequent decay of\nmagnetic domain switching. Mechanical force applied on the surface of\nBi5Ti3FeO15 film generates by an AFM tip will effectively drive a transition of\nthe local ferroelastic strain state, reverse both the polarization and\nmagnetization in a way similar to an electric field. Current work provides a\nframework for exploring cross-coupling among multiple orders and potential for\ndeveloping novel nanoscale functional devices.\n", "  Many chemical reactions in biological cells occur at very low concentrations\nof constituent molecules. Thus, transcriptional gene-regulation is often\ncontrolled by poorly expressed transcription-factors, such as E.coli lac\nrepressor with few tens of copies. Here we study the effects of inherent\nconcentration fluctuations of substrate-molecules on the seminal\nMichaelis-Menten scheme of biochemical reactions. We present a universal\ncorrection to the Michaelis-Menten equation for the reaction-rates. The\nrelevance and validity of this correction for enzymatic reactions and\nintracellular gene-regulation is demonstrated. Our analytical theory and\nsimulation results confirm that the proposed variance-corrected\nMichaelis-Menten equation predicts the rate of reactions with remarkable\naccuracy even in the presence of large non-equilibrium concentration\nfluctuations. The major advantage of our approach is that it involves only the\nmean and variance of the substrate-molecule concentration. Our theory is\ntherefore accessible to experiments and not specific to the exact source of the\nconcentration fluctuations.\n", "  The detection of individual photons is an inherently binary mechanism,\nrevealing either their absence or presence while concealing their spectral\ninformation. For multi-color imaging techniques, such as single photon\nspectroscopy, fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy and\nfluorescence correlation spectroscopy, wavelength discrimination is essential\nand mandates spectral separation prior to detection. Here, we adopt an approach\nborrowed from quantum photonic integration to realize a compact and scalable\nwaveguide-integrated single-photon spectrometer capable of parallel detection\non multiple wavelength channels, with temporal resolution below 50 ps and dark\ncount rates below 10 Hz. We demonstrate multi-detector devices for\ntelecommunication and visible wavelengths and showcase their performance by\nimaging silicon vacancy color centers in diamond nanoclusters. The fully\nintegrated hybrid superconducting-nanophotonic circuits enable simultaneous\nspectroscopy and lifetime mapping for correlative imaging and provide the\ningredients for quantum wavelength division multiplexing on a chip.\n", "  In the propagating oscillatory shock model, the oscillation of the post-shock\nregion, i.e., the Compton cloud, causes the observed low-frequency\nquasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). The evolution of QPO frequency is explained\nby the systematic variation of the Compton cloud size, i.e., the steady radial\nmovement of the shock front, which is triggered by the cooling of the\npost-shock region. Thus, analysis of energy-dependent temporal properties in\ndifferent variability time scales can diagnose the dynamics and geometry of\naccretion flows around black holes. We study these properties for the high\ninclination black hole source XTE J1550-564 during its 1998 outburst and the\nlow-inclination black hole source GX 339-4 during its 2006-07 outburst using\nRXTE/PCA data, and we find that they can satisfactorily explain the time lags\nassociated with the QPOs from these systems. We find a smooth decrease of the\ntime lag as a function of time in the rising phase of both sources. In the\ndeclining phase the time lag increases with time. We find a systematic\nevolution of QPO frequency and hard lags in these outbursts. In XTE J1550-564,\nthe lag changes from hard to soft (i.e., from a positive to a negative value)\nat a crossing frequency ($\\nu_C$) of $\\sim 3.4$ Hz. We present possible\nmechanisms to explain the lag behavior of high and low-inclination sources\nwithin the framework of a single two-component advective flow model (TCAF).\n", "  Graphene, the one-atom-thick sp2 hybridized carbon crystal, displays unique\nelectronic, structural and mechanical properties, which promise a large number\nof interesting applications in diverse high tech fields. Many of these\napplications require its functionalization, e.g. with substitution of carbon\natoms or adhesion of chemical species, creation of defects, modification of\nstructure of morphology, to open electronic band gap to use it in electronics,\nor to create 3D frameworks for volumetric applications. Understanding the\nmorphology-properties relationship is the first step to efficiently\nfunctionalize graphene. Therefore a great theoretical effort has been recently\ndevoted to model graphene in different conditions and with different approaches\ninvolving different level of accuracy and resolution. Here we review the\nmodeling approaches to graphene systems, with a special focus on atomistic\nlevel methods, but extending our analysis onto coarser scales. We illustrate\nthe methods by means of applications with possible potential impact.\n", "  To better design safe and comfortable urban spaces, understanding the nature\nof human crowd movement is important. However, precise interactions among\npedestrians are difficult to measure in the presence of their complex\ndecision-making processes and many related factors. While extensive studies on\npedestrian flow through bottlenecks and corridors have been conducted, the\ndominant mode of interaction in these scenarios may not be relevant in\ndifferent scenarios. Here, we attempt to decipher the factors that affect human\nreactions to other individuals from a different perspective. We conducted\nexperiments employing the inflow process in which pedestrians successively\nenter a confined area (like an elevator) and look for a temporary position. In\nthis process, pedestrians have a wider range of options regarding their motion\nthan in the classical scenarios; therefore, other factors might become\nrelevant. The preference of location is visualized by pedestrian density\nprofiles obtained from recorded pedestrian trajectories. Non-trivial patterns\nof space acquisition, e.g., an apparent preference for positions near corners,\nwere observed. This indicates the relevance of psychological and anticipative\nfactors beyond the private sphere, which have not been deeply discussed so far\nin the literature on pedestrian dynamics. From the results, four major factors,\nwhich we call flow avoidance, distance cost, angle cost, and boundary\npreference, were suggested. We confirmed that a description of decision-making\nbased on these factors can give a rise to realistic preference patterns, using\na simple mathematical model. Our findings provide new perspectives and a\nbaseline for considering the optimization of design and safety in crowded\npublic areas and public transport carriers.\n", "  The volume occupied by unconstrained bacterial DNA in physiological solutions\nexceeds 1000 times the volume of the cell. Still, it is confined to a well\ndefined region of the cell called the nucleoid, which occupies only a fraction\nof the cell volume. There is still no general agreement on the mechanism\nleading to the compaction of the DNA and the formation of the nucleoid.\nHowever, advances in in vivo sub-wavelength resolution microscopy techniques\nhave recently allowed the observation of the nucleoid at an unprecedented level\nof detail. In particular, these observations show that the compaction of the\nnucleoid is not static but is instead a highly dynamic feature, which depends\non several factors, like the richness of the nutrient, the cell cycle stage,\ntemperature, the action of an osmotic shock or antibiotics, etc. After a short\ndescription of the electrolyte content of the cytosol and a brief overview of\nthe different mechanisms that may lead to the formation of the nucleoid, this\npaper reviews some of the most fascinating recent results of in vivo\nsub-wavelength resolution microscopy. It is furthermore argued that these\nobservations provide converging indications in favor of a model that describes\nthe cytosol as an aqueous electrolyte solution containing several\nmacromolecular species, where demixing and segregative phase separation occur\nbetween DNA and RNA (essentially rRNA and mRNA involved in translation\ncomplexes, but also the large amounts of rRNA synthesized at the rrn operons of\ncells growing in rich media). It is also pointed out that crowding may play a\ncrucial role through its synergy with electrostatic forces. By constraining\nmacromolecules to remain at short distances from one another and feel\nelectrostatic interactions in spite of the strong screening exerted by\nelectrolyte species, crowding favors stronger DNA/RNA demixing and nucleoid\ncompaction.\n", "  The physics of energy filtering in electronic transport through nanoscale\nbarriers is a fundamental aspect in the context of electronic engineering of\nnanostructured thermoelectrics. In the context of thermoelectric generators, it\naims to engineer the Seebeck coefficient to favorably increase the power factor\nand ultimately the power generated. In this work, we employ the incoherent\nnon-equilibrium Green's function formalism to investigate in detail the physics\nof energy filtering and how it leads to a direct enhancement in power\ngeneration across nanostructured thermoelectrics featuring a single planar\nenergy barrier. In particular, we reinforce that the enhancement in the\ngenerated power via energy filtering at a particular operating efficiency is a\ncharacteristic of incoherent scattering and is absent in ballistic devices. In\nsuch cases, by assuming an energy dependent relaxation time, $\\tau(E)=kE^r$, we\nshow that there exists a minimum value $r_{min}$ for which the thermoelectric\npower generation is enhanced and thereby leading to a degradation in power\ngeneration for $r<r_{min}$. For bulk generators, we delve into the details of\nintermode scattering and show that such scattering processes between electrons\nin higher energy modes and lower energy modes have a finite contribution to the\nenhancement in the generated power. We also discuss realistic aspects such as\nfinite width of energy barriers and imperfect energy filtering due to partial\nreflections. In particular, we show that such imperfect filtering and partial\ntransmission of electrons near the top of the barrier affects the enhancement\nin the generated power drastically in the high efficiency regime of operation.\nAnalysis of the results obtained in this work should provide general design\nguidelines for nanostructured enhancement in power generation via energy\nfiltering.\n", "  M87 is one of the nearest radio galaxies with a central SMBH and a prominent\nrelativistic jet. Due to its close distance to the observer and the large SMBH\nmass, the source is one of the best laboratories to obtain strong observational\nconstraints on the theoretical models for the formation and evolution of the\nAGN jets. In this article, we present preliminary results from our ongoing\nobservational study about the innermost jet of M87 at an ultra-high resolution\nof $\\sim$50${\\mu}$as achieved by the Global Millimeter-VLBI Array (GMVA). The\ndata obtained between 2004 and 2015 clearly show limb-brightened jets at\nextreme resolution and sensitivity. Our preliminary analysis reveals that the\ninnermost jet expands in an edge-brightened cone structure (parabolic shape)\nbut with the jet expansion profile slightly different from the outer regions of\nthe jet. Brightness temperatures of the VLBI core obtained from cm- to\nmm-wavelengths show a systematic evolution, which can be interpreted as the\nevolution as a function of distance from the BH. We also adopt an alternative\nimaging algorithm, BSMEM, to test reliable imaging at higher angular resolution\nthan provided by the standard CLEAN method (i.e. super-resolution). A\ndemonstration with a VLBA 7mm example data set shows consistent results with a\nnear-in-time 3mm VLBI image. Application of the method to the 2009 GMVA data\nyields an image with remarkable fine-scale structures that have been never\nimaged before. We present a brief interpretation of the complexity in the\nstructure.\n", "  The magneto-optical activity of high quality transparent thin films of\ninsulating EuTiO3 (ETO) deposited on a thin SrTiO3 (STO) substrate with both\nbeing non-magnetic materials are demonstrated to be a versatile tool for light\nmodulation. The operating temperature is close to room temperature and admits\nmultiple device engineering. By using small magnetic fields birefringence of\nthe samples can be switched off and on. Similarly, rotation of the sample in\nthe field can modify its birefringence {\\Delta}n. In addition, {\\Delta}n can be\nincreased by a factor of 4 in very modest fields with simultaneously enhancing\nthe operating temperature by almost 100K.\n", "  We report on nonlinear frequency conversion from the telecom range via second\nharmonic generation (SHG) and third harmonic generation (THG) in suspended\ngallium nitride slab photonic crystal (PhC) cavities on silicon, under\ncontinuous-wave resonant excitation. Optimized two-dimensional PhC cavities\nwith augmented far-field coupling have been characterized with quality factors\nas high as 4.4$\\times10^{4}$, approaching the computed theoretical values. The\nstrong enhancement in light confinement has enabled efficient SHG, achieving\nnormalized conversion efficiency of 2.4$\\times10^{-3}$ $W^{-1}$, as well as\nsimultaneous THG. SHG emission power of up to 0.74 nW has been detected without\nsaturation. The results herein validate the suitability of gallium nitride for\nintegrated nonlinear optical processing.\n", "  The $^{11}$C($\\alpha$, p) reaction is an important $\\alpha$-induced reaction\ncompeting with $\\beta$-limited hydrogen-burning processes in high-temperature\nexplosive stars. We directly measured its reaction cross sections both for the\nground-state transition ($\\alpha$, $p_{0}$) and the excited-state transitions\n($\\alpha$, $p_{1}$) and ($\\alpha$, $p_{2}$) at relevant stellar energies 1.3 -\n4.5 MeV by an extended thick-target method featuring time of flight for the\nfirst time. We revised the reaction rate by numerical integration including the\n($\\alpha$, $p_{1}$) and ($\\alpha$, $p_{2}$) contributions and also low-lying\nresonances of ($\\alpha$, $p_{0}$) using both the present and the previous\nexperimental data which were totally neglected in the previous compilation\nworks. The present total reaction rate lies between the previous ($\\alpha$,\n$p_{0}$) rate and the total rate of the Hauser-Feshbach statistical model\ncalculation, which is consistent with the relevant explosive hydrogen-burning\nscenarios such as the $\\nu p$-process.\n", "  We developed a CUDA-based parallelization of the annealing method for the\ninverse Laplace transform problem. The algorithm is based on annealing\nalgorithm and minimizes residue of the reconstruction of the spectral function.\nWe introduce local updates which preserve first two sum rules and allow an\nefficient parallel CUDA implementation. Annealing is performed with the Monte\nCarlo method on a population of Markov walkers. We propose imprinted branching\nmethod to improve further the convergence of the anneal. The algorithm is\ntested on truncated double-peak Lorentzian spectrum with examples of how the\nerror in the input data affects the reconstruction.\n", "  Current vapor-compression technology is based on the gas-liquid transition of\nhazardous gas. The alternative cooling technology focuses on the solid caloric\nmaterial. A new liquid barocaloric material, i.e. the liquid crystal, is proved\nto be potential for cooling application primarily (based on other literatures).\nIts phase transition needs a small stress (tens of MPa) and can be operated\nnear room temperature. It has a large entropy change of ~200 J.K-1.kg-1 (0.2\nJ.K-1.cm-1). There is no breakage problem due to its liquid form. It will\nprovide the advantage for some unique cooling application cases comparing with\nsolid caloric material. Moreover, this material is sustainable and non-toxic,\nwhich can meet the original intention of the alternative cooling technology.\n", "  Using the traditional and degenerative discrete-diffractive versions of Bethe\nAnsatz we construct a rude set of three-magnon states in the infinite $XX$ spin\nchain with Izing next neighboring ferromagnetic term.\n", "  The TBT project is being developed under ESA's General Studies and Technology\nProgramme (GSTP), and shall implement a test-bed for the validation of an\nautonomous optical observing system in a realistic scenario within the Space\nSituational Awareness (SSA) programme of the European Space Agency (ESA). The\ngoal of the project is to provide two fully robotic telescopes, which will\nserve as prototypes for development of a future network. The system consists of\ntwo telescopes, one in Spain and the second one in the Southern Hemisphere. The\ntelescope is a fast astrograph with a large Field of View of 2.5 x 2.5\nsquare-degrees and a plate scale of 2.2 arcsec/pixel. The tube is mounted on a\nfast direct-drive mount moving with speed up to 20 degrees per second. The\nfocal plane hosts a 2-port 4K x 4K back-illuminated CCD with readout speeds up\nto 1MHz per port. Detection software and hardware are optimised for the\ndetection of NEOs and objects in high Earth orbits (objects moving from 0.1-40\narcsec/second). Every night it takes all the input needed and prepares a\nschedule following predefined rules allocating tasks for the telescopes.\nTelescopes are managed by RTS2 control software, that performs the real-time\nscheduling of the observation and manages all the devices at the observatory.1\nAt the end of the night the observing systems report astrometric positions and\nphotometry of the objects detected. The first telescope was installed in\nCebreros Satellite Tracking Station in mid-2015. We evaluate the site\ncharacteristics and the performance of the TBT Cebreros telescope in the\ndifferent modes and strategies. Average residuals for asteroids are under 0.5\narcsecond, while they are around 1 arcsecond for upper-MEO and GEO satellites.\nThe survey depth is dimmer than magnitude 18.5 for 30-second exposures with the\nusual seeing around 4 arcseconds.\n", "  The beam condition monitoring leakage (BCML) system is a beam monitoring\ndevice in the compact muon solenoid (CMS) experiment at the large hadron\ncollider (LHC). As detectors 32 poly-crystalline (pCVD) diamond sensors are\npositioned in rings around the beam pipe. Here, high particle rates occur from\nthe colliding beams scattering particles outside the beam pipe. These particles\ncause defects, which act as traps for the ionization, thus reducing the charge\ncollection efficiency (CCE). However, the loss in CCE was much more severe than\nexpected from low rate laboratory measurements and simulations, especially in\nsingle-crystalline (sCVD) diamonds, which have a low initial concentration of\ndefects. The reason why in real experiments the CCE is much worse than in\nlaboratory experiments is related to the ionization rate. At high particle\nrates the trapping rate of the ionization is so high compared with the\ndetrapping rate, that space charge builds up. This space charge reduces locally\nthe internal electric field, which in turn increases the trapping rate and\nrecombination and hence reduces the CCE in a strongly non-linear way. A diamond\nirradiation campaign was started to investigate the rate dependent electrical\nfield deformation with respect to the radiation damage. Besides the electrical\nfield measurements via the Transient Current Technique (TCT), the CCE was\nmeasured. The experimental results were used to create an effective deep trap\nmodel that takes the radiation damage into account. Using this trap model the\nrate dependent electrical field deformation and the CCE were simulated with the\nsoftware SILVACO TCAD. The simulation, tuned to rate dependent measurements\nfrom a strong radioactive source, was able to predict the non-linear decrease\nof the CCE in the harsh environment of the LHC, where the particle rate was a\nfactor 30 higher.\n", "  Modulating energy states of metallic glasses (MGs) is significant in\nunderstanding the nature of glasses and control their properties. In this\nstudy, we show that rejuvenation in enthalpy can be achieved and preserved in\nbulk MGs by using high pressure (HP) annealing, which is a controllable method\nto continuously alter the energy states of MGs. Contrary to the decrease in\nenthalpy by conventional annealing at ambient pressure, such rejuvenation can\noccur and be enhanced by increasing both of annealing temperature and pressure.\nBy using double aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy,\nit is revealed that the rejuvenation, which is attributed to coupling effect of\nhigh pressure and high temperature, originates from the microstructural change\nthat involves \"negative flow units\" with a higher atomic packing density\ncompared to that of the elastic matrix of MGs. The results demonstrate that HP\nannealing is an effective way to rejuvenate MGs into higher energy states, and\nit may assist in understanding the microstructural origin of the rejuvenation\nin MGs.\n", "  Atmosphere layers, especially the troposphere, hinder the astronomical\nobservation. For more than 100 years astronomers have tried observing from\nballoons to avoid turbulence and extinction. New developments in cardsize\ncomputers, RF equipment and satellite navigation have democratised the access\nto the stratosphere. As a result of a ProAm collaboration with the Daedalus\nTeam we have developed a low-cost multi-purpose platform with stratospheric\nballoons carrying up to 3 kg of scientific payload. The Daedalus Team is an\namateur group that has been launching sounding probes since 2010. Since then\nthe first two authors have provided scienti fic payloads for nighttime flights\nwith the purpose of technology demonstration for astronomical observation. We\nhave successfully observed meteor showers (Geminids 2012, Camelopardalis 2014,\nQuadrantids 2016 and Lyrids 2016) and city light pollution emission with image\nand video sensors covering the 400-1000nm range.\n", "  Robots and Humans have to share the same environment more and more often. In\nthe aim of steering robots in a safe and convenient manner among humans it is\nrequired to understand how humans interact with them. This work focuses on\ncollision avoidance between a human and a robot during locomotion. Having in\nmind previous results on human obstacle avoidance, as well as the description\nof the main principles which guide collision avoidance strategies, we observe\nhow humans adapt a goal-directed locomotion task when they have to interfere\nwith a mobile robot. Our results show differences in the strategy set by humans\nto avoid a robot in comparison with avoiding another human. Humans prefer to\ngive the way to the robot even when they are likely to pass first at the\nbeginning of the interaction.\n", "  In this paper we found, by means of numerical simulations, a transition in\nthe oscillatory character of the flow field for a particular combination of\nbuoyancy and spacing in an array of six circular cylinders at a Reynolds number\nof 100 and Prandtl number of 0.7. The cylinders are iso-thermal and they are\naligned with the Earth acceleration (g). According to the array orientation, an\naiding or an opposing buoyancy is considered. The effect of natural convection\nwith respect to the forced convection is modulated with the Richardson number,\nRi, ranging between -1 and 1. Two values of center to center spacing (s=3.6d -\n4d) are considered. The effects of buoyancy and spacing on the flow pattern in\nthe near and far field are described. Several transitions in the flow patterns\nare found and a parametric analysis of the dependence of the force coefficients\nand Nusselt number with respect to the Richardson number is reported. For\nRi=-1, the change of spacing ratio from 3.6 to 4 induces a transition in the\nstandard deviation of the force coefficients and heat flux. In fact the\ntransition occurs due to rearrangement of the near field flow in a more ordered\nwake pattern. Therefore, attention is focused on the influence of geometrical\nand buoyancy parameters on the heat and momentum exchange and their\nfluctuations. The available heat exchange models for cylinders array provide a\nnot accurate prediction of the Nusselt number in the cases here studied.\n", "  We study the possible types of future singularities in the isotropic\nhomogeneous cosmological models for the arbitrary equation of state of the\ncontents of the Universe. We obtain all known types of these singularities as\nwell as two new types using a simple approach. No additional singularity types\nare possible. We name the new singularities type \"Big Squeeze\" and \"Little\nFreeze\". The \"Big Squeeze\" is possible only in the flat Universe after a finite\ntime interval. The density of the matter and dark energy tends to zero and its\npressure to minus infinity. This requires the dark energy with a specific\nequation of state that has the same asymptotical behaviour at low densities as\nthe generalised Chaplygin gas. The \"Little Freeze\" involves an eternal\nexpansion of the Universe. Some solutions can mimic the $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n", "  In this paper, we present a quantum-field-theoretical description of the\ninteraction between stationary and localized external sources linearly coupled\nto bosonic fields (specifically, we study models with a scalar and the Maxwell\nfield). We consider external sources that simulate not only point charges but\nalso higher-multipole distributions along D-dimensional branes. Our results\ncomplement the ones previously obtained in reference [1].\n", "  Direct observations using scanning transmission electron microscopy unveil an\nintriguing interfacial bi-layer that enables epitaxial growth of a strain-free,\nmonoclinic, bronze-phase VO2(B) thin film on a perovskite SrTiO3 (STO)\nsubstrate. We observe an ultrathin (2-3 unit cells) interlayer best described\nas highly strained VO2(B) nanodomains combined with an extra (Ti,V)O2 layer on\nthe TiO2 terminated STO (001) surface. By forming a fully coherent interface\nwith the STO substrate and a semi-coherent interface with the strain-free\nepitaxial VO2(B) film above, the interfacial bi-layer enables the epitaxial\nconnection of the two materials despite their large symmetry and lattice\nmismatch.\n", "  Microscopic liquid brines, especially calcium-perchlorate could emerge by\ndeliquescence on Mars during night time hours. Using climate model computations\nand orbital humidity observations, the ideal periods and their annual plus\ndaily characteristics at various past, current and future landing sites were\ncompared. Such results provide context for future analysis and targeting the\nrelated observations by the next missions for Mars. Based on the analysis, at\nmost (but not all) past missions' landing sites, microscopic brine could emerge\nduring night time for different durations. Analysing the conditions at ExoMars\nrover's primary landing site at Oxia Planum, the best annual period was found\nto be between $L_s$ 115 - 225, and in $Local\\hspace{0.1cm} Time$ 2 - 5, after\nmidnight. In an ideal case, 4 hours of continuous liquid phase can emerge\nthere. Local conditions might cause values to differ from those estimated by\nthe model. Thermal inertia could especially make such differences (low TI\nvalues favour fast cooling and $\\textrm{H}_2\\textrm{O}$ cold trapping at loose\nsurfaces) and the concentration of calcium-perchlorate salt in the regolith\nalso influences the process (it might occur preferentially at long-term exposed\nsurfaces without recent loose dust coverage). These factors should be taken\ninto account while targeting future liquid water observations on Mars.\n", "  Environment induced decoherence, and other quantum processes, have been\nproposed in the literature to explain the apparent spontaneous selection - out\nof the many mathematically eligible bases - of a privileged measurement basis\nthat corresponds to what we actually observe. This paper describes such\nprocesses, and demonstrates that - contrary to common belief - no such process\ncan actually lead to a preferred basis in general. The key observation is that\nenvironment induced decoherence implicitly assumes a prior independence of the\nobserved system, the observer and the environment. However, such independence\ncannot be guaranteed, and we show that environment induced decoherence does not\nsucceed in establishing a preferred measurement basis in general. We conclude\nthat the existence of the preferred basis must be postulated in quantum\nmechanics, and that changing the basis for a measurement is, and must be,\ndescribed as an actual physical process.\n", "  DEAP-3600 is a single phase liquid argon (LAr) dark matter experiment,\nlocated 2 km underground at SNOLAB, in Sudbury, Canada. The detector has 1\ntonne fiducial mass of LAr. The target sensitivity to spin-independent\nscattering of 100 GeV weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) is\n10$^{-46}$ cm$^{2}$. The DEAP-3600 background target is $<$ 0.6 background\nevents in the WIMP region of interest in 3 tonne-years. The strategies to\nachieve this background include pulse shape discrimination to mitigate electron\nrecoil and using ultra low radioactive materials for detector construction.\nFurthermore, to reduce neutron and alpha backgrounds, the DEAP-3600 acrylic\nvessel was sanded in situ to mitigate radon exposure of surfaces during\nconstruction and fabrication. The experiment is currently in the commissioning\nphase and will begin physics data taking later this year. This paper presents\nan overview of the experiment, its cross-section sensitivity to WIMPs and its\ncurrent status.\n", "  Analysis and modeling of networked objects are fundamental pieces of modern\ndata mining. Most real-world networks, from biological to social ones, are\nknown to have common structural properties. These properties allow us to model\nthe growth processes of networks and to develop useful algorithms. One\nremarkable example is the fractality of networks, which suggests the\nself-similar organization of global network structure. To determine the\nfractality of a network, we need to solve the so-called box-covering problem,\nwhere preceding algorithms are not feasible for large-scale networks. The lack\nof an efficient algorithm prevents us from investigating the fractal nature of\nlarge-scale networks. To overcome this issue, we propose a new box-covering\nalgorithm based on recently emerging sketching techniques. We theoretically\nshow that it works in near-linear time with a guarantee of solution accuracy.\nIn experiments, we have confirmed that the algorithm enables us to study the\nfractality of million-scale networks for the first time. We have observed that\nits outputs are sufficiently accurate and that its time and space requirements\nare orders of magnitude smaller than those of previous algorithms.\n", "  We present results of carbon coatings on metal substrates in cylindrical\nhollow cathode (CHC) direct current magnetron sputtering. This is a new\ntechnique of making amorphous carbon film in CHC magnetron sputtering from\nregenerative sooting discharge. The carbon films are deposited on Cu and Al\nsubstrates in Ne atmosphere and compared with the films of carbon soot on the\nsame materials produced from conventional arc discharge between graphite\nelectrodes at 80 Angstrom in He background. The films are characterized using\nonline emission, Raman, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; X-ray\ndiffraction (XRD) and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Raman spectroscopy\nreveals the existence of graphite and diamond like structures from arc\ndischarge while in CHC magnetron sputtering, graphite like structures are\ndominant. XRD pattern from arc discharge show precipitates of Al4C3 of\nrhombohedral and hexagonal types in nanometer ranges for aluminum sample and\nprobable formation of diamond and hexagonal carbon in copper whilst in\nmagnetron sputtering we get amorphous carbon films. SEM images of surface show\ncollection of loose agglomerates of carbon particles in arc discharge whereas\nfor magnetron sputtering structures are regular with smooth edges and fine\ngrains.\n", "  We report on some quantum properties of physical systems, namely,\nentanglement, nonlocality, $k$-copy nonlocality (superactivation of\nnonlocality), hidden nonlocality (activation of nonlocality through local\nfiltering) and the activation of nonlocality through tensoring and local\nfiltering. The aim of this work is two-fold. First, we provide a review of the\nnumerical procedures that must be followed in order to calculate the\naforementioned properties, in particular, for any two-qubit system, and\nreproduce the bounds for two-qudit Werner states. Second, we use such numerical\ntools to calculate new bounds of these properties for two-qudit Isotropic\nstates and two-qubit Hirsch states.\n", "  This paper describes general characteristics of the deployment and\ncommissioned of the Detector Control System (DCS) AD0 for the second phase of\nthe Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The AD0 detector is installed in the ALICE\nexperiment to provide a better selection of diffractive events.\n", "  In this article we expound a discovery of the quantum equivalence/duality of\nU(N) noncommutative quantum field theories (NC QFT) related by the theta-exact\nSeiberg-Witten (SW) maps and at all orders in the perturbation theory with\nrespect to the coupling constant. We show that this proof holds for Super\nYang-Mills (SYM) theories with N=0,1,2,4$ supersymmetry. In short,\nSeiberg-Witten map does commute with the quantization of the U(N) NCQFT\nindependently, with or without supersymmetry.\n", "  The current state of the link problem between radio and optical celestial\nreference frames is considered. The main objectives of the investigations in\nthis direction during the next few years are the preparation of a comparison\nand the mutual orientation and rotation between the optical {\\it Gaia}\nCelestial Reference Frame (GCRF) and the 3rd generation radio International\nCelestial Reference Frame (ICRF3), obtained from VLBI observations. Both\nsystems, ideally, should be a realization of the ICRS (International Celestial\nReference System) at micro-arcsecond level accuracy. Therefore, the link\naccuracy between the ICRF and GCRF should be obtained with similar error level,\nwhich is not a trivial task due to relatively large systematic and random\nerrors in source positions at different frequency bands. In this paper, a brief\noverview of recent work on the GCRF--ICRF link is presented. Additional\npossibilities to improve the GCRF--ICRF link accuracy are discussed. The\nsuggestion is made to use astrometric radio sources with optical magnitude to\n20$^m$ rather than to 18$^m$ as currently planned for the GCRF--ICRF link. In\naddition, the use of radio stars is also a prospective method to obtain\nindependent and accurate orientation between the Gaia frame and the ICRF.\n", "  Motivated by the engineering applications of uncertainty quantification, in\nthis work we draw connections between the notions of random quantum states and\noperations in quantum information with probability distributions commonly\nencountered in the field of orientation statistics. This approach identifies\nnatural probability distributions that can be used in the analysis, simulation,\nand inference of quantum information systems. The theory of exponential\nfamilies on Stiefel manifolds provides the appropriate generalization to the\nclassical case, and fortunately there are many existing techniques for\ninference and sampling that exist for these distributions. Furthermore, this\nviewpoint motivates a number of additional questions into the convex geometry\nof quantum operations relative to both the differential geometry of Stiefel\nmanifolds as well as the information geometry of exponential families defined\nupon them. In particular, we draw on results from convex geometry to\ncharacterize which quantum operations can be represented as the average of a\nrandom quantum operation.\n", "  In order to model ion transport across protocell membranes in Hadean\nhydrothermal vents, we consider both theoretically and experimentally the\nplanar growth of a precipitate membrane formed at the interface between two\nparallel fluid streams in a two-dimensional microfluidic reactor. The growth\nrate of the precipitate is found to be proportional to the square root of time,\nwhich is characteristic of diffusive transport. However, the dependence of the\ngrowth rate on the concentrations of hydroxide and metal ions is approximately\nlinear and quadratic, respectively. We show that such a difference in ionic\ntransport dynamics arises from the enhanced transport of metal ions across a\nthin gel layer present at the surface of the precipitate. The fluctuations in\ntransverse velocity in this wavy porous gel layer allow an enhanced transport\nof the cation, so that the effective diffusivity is about an order of magnitude\nhigher than that expected from molecular diffusion alone. Our theoretical\npredictions are in excellent agreement with our laboratory measurements of the\ngrowth of a manganese hydroxide membrane in a microfluidic channel, and this\nenhanced transport is thought to have been needed to account for the\nbioenergetics of the first single-celled organisms.\n", "  There is an enormous amount of information that can be extracted from the\ndata of a quantum gas microscope that has yet to be fully explored. The quantum\ngas microscope has been used to directly measure magnetic order, dynamic\ncorrelations, Pauli blocking, and many other physical phenomena in several\nrecent groundbreaking experiments. However, the analysis of the data from a\nquantum gas microscope can be pushed much further, and when used in conjunction\nwith theoretical constructs it is possible to measure virtually any observable\nof interest in a wide range of systems. We focus on how to measure quantum\nentanglement in large interacting quantum systems. In particular, we show that\nquantum gas microscopes can be used to measure the entanglement of interacting\nboson systems exactly, where previously it had been thought this was only\npossible for non-interacting systems. We consider algorithms that can work for\nlarge experimental data sets which are similar to theoretical variational Monte\nCarlo techniques, and more data limited sets using properties of correlation\nfunctions.\n"]}
