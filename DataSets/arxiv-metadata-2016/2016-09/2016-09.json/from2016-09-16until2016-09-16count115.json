Under the infinitesimal external magnetic field,\nthe phase transition behaviors due to the thermal fluctuations are discussed by\nthe newly developed tensor renormalization group method. For the case of the\ninteger spin-S, the system will undergo $S$ first-order phase transitions with\nthe successive symmetry breaking with the magnetization $M=S,S-1,...0$. For the\nhalf-integer spin-S, there are similar $S-1/2$ first order phase transition\nwith $M=S,S-1,...1/2$ stepwise structure, in addition, there is a continuous\nphase transition due to the spin-flip $Z_2$ symmetry breaking. In the low\ntemperature regions, all first-order phase transitions are accompanied by the\nsuccessive disappearance of the optional spin-component pairs($s,-s$),\nfurthermore, the critical temperature for the nth first-order phase transition\nis the same, independent of the value of the spin-S. In the absence of the\nmagnetic field, the visualization parameter characterizing the intrinsic\ndegeneracy of the different phases clearly demonstrates the phase transition\nprocess.\n", "  We present gravitational N-body simulations of the secular morphological\nevolution of disk galaxies induced by density wave modes. In particular, we\naddress the demands collective effects place on the choice of simulation\nparameters, and show that the common practice of the use of a large gravity\nsoftening parameter was responsible for the failure of past simulations to\ncorrectly model the secular evolution process in galaxies, even for those\nsimulations where the choice of basic state allows an unstable mode to emerge,\na prerequisite for obtaining the coordinated radial mass flow pattern needed\nfor secular evolution of galaxies along the Hubble sequence. We also\ndemonstrate that the secular evolution rates measured in our improved\nsimulations agree to an impressive degree with the corresponding rates\npredicted by the recently-advanced theories of dynamically-driven secular\nevolution of galaxies. The results of the current work, besides having direct\nimplications on the cosmological evolution of galaxies, also shed light on the\ngeneral question of how irreversibility emerges from a nominally reversible\nphysical system.\n", "  We propose an extension of the Dubrovin-Zhang perturbative approach to the\nstudy of normal forms for non-Hamiltonian integrable scalar conservation laws.\nThe explicit computation of the first few corrections leads to the conjecture\nthat such normal forms are parameterized by one single functional parameter,\nnamed viscous central invariant. A constant valued viscous central invariant\ncorresponds to the well-known Burgers hierarchy. The case of a linear viscous\ncentral invariant provides a viscous analog of the Camassa-Holm equation, that\nformerly appeared as a reduction of a two-component Hamiltonian integrable\nsystems. We write explicitly the negative and positive hierarchy associated\nwith this equation and prove the integrability showing that they can be mapped\nrespectively into the heat hierarchy and its negative counterpart, named the\nKlein-Gordon hierarchy. A local well-posedness theorem for periodic initial\ndata is also proven. We show how transport equations can be used to effectively\nconstruct asymptotic solutions via an extension of the quasi-Miura map that\npreserves the initial datum. The method is alternative to the method of the\nstring equation for Hamiltonian conservation laws and naturally extends to the\nviscous case. Using these tools we derive the viscous analog of the Painlev\\'e\nI2 equation that describes the universal behaviour of the solution at the\ncritical point of gradient catastrophe.\n", "  A procedure to obtain single-electron wavefunctions within the tight-binding\nformalism is proposed. It is based on linear combinations of Slater-type\norbitals whose screening coefficients are extracted from the optical matrix\nelements of the tight-binding Hamiltonian. Bloch functions obtained for\nzinc-blende semiconductors in the extended-basis spds* tight-binding model\ndemonstrate very good agreement with first-principles wavefunctions. We apply\nthis method to the calculation of electron-hole exchange interaction, and\nobtain the dispersion of excitonic fine structure of bulk GaAs. Beyond\nsemiconductor nanostructures, this work is a fundamental step toward modeling\nmany-body effects from post-processing single particle wavefunctions within the\ntight-binding theory.\n", "  CdSe nanoplatelets show perfectly quantized thicknesses of few monolayers.\nThey present a situation of extreme, yet well defined quantum confinement. Due\nto large dielectric contrast between the semiconductor and its ligand\nenvironment, interaction between carriers and their dielectric images strongly\nrenormalize bare single particle states. We discuss the electronic properties\nof this original system in an advanced tight-binding model, and show that\nCoulomb interactions, including self-energy corrections and enhanced\nelectron-hole interaction, lead to exciton binding energies up to several\nhundred meVs.\n", "  Geometric quantum computation is the idea that geometric phases can be used\nto implement quantum gates, i.e., the basic elements of the Boolean network\nthat forms a quantum computer. Although originally thought to be limited to\nadiabatic evolution, controlled by slowly changing parameters, this form of\nquantum computation can as well be realized at high speed by using nonadiabatic\nschemes. Recent advances in quantum gate technology have allowed for\nexperimental demonstrations of different types of geometric gates in adiabatic\nand nonadiabatic evolution. Here, we address some conceptual issues that arise\nin the realizations of geometric gates. We examine the appearance of dynamical\nphases in quantum evolution and point out that not all dynamical phases need to\nbe compensated for in geometric quantum computation. We delineate the relation\nbetween Abelian and non-Abelian geometric gates and find an explicit physical\nexample where the two types of gates coincide. We identify differences and\nsimilarities between adiabatic and nonadiabatic realizations of quantum\ncomputation based on non-Abelian geometric phases.\n", "  Quantum mechanics predicts superposition of position states even for\nmacroscopic objects. Recently, the use of a quasi-freely suspended mirror\ncombined with laser was proposed to prepare such states, by M\\\"uller-Ebhardt et\nal. [Phys.Rev.Lett.100, 013601 (2008)]. One of the key milestones towards this\ngoal is the preparation of the mechanical oscillator mainly driven by quantum\nback-action, which identifies the connection between the object and quantumness\nof the light. Here, we describe development of a suspended 5-mg mirror driven\nby quantum back-action larger than thermal fluctuating force by a factor of\n1.4$\\pm$0.2 at 325 Hz,which is confirmed by using a triangular optical cavity.\n", "  We examine the possibility of intrinsic interface states bound to the plane\nof In-Sb chemical bonds at InAs/AlSb interfaces. Careful parameterization of\nthe bulk materials in the frame of the extended basis spds^* tight-binding\nmodel and recent progress in predictions of band offsets severely limit the\nspan of tight-binding parameters describing this system. We find that a\nheavy-hole like interface state bound to the plane of In-Sb bonds exists for a\nlarge range of values of the InSb/InAs band offset.\n", "  We discuss a discrete analogue of the Dirac-K\\\"{a}hler equation in which\nchiral properties of the continual counterpart are captured. We pay special\nattention to a discrete Hodge star operator. To build one a combinatorial\nconstruction of double complex is used. We describe discrete exterior calculus\noperations on a double comlex and obtain the discrete Dirac-K\\\"{a}hler equation\nusing these tools. Self-dual and anti-self-dual discrete inhomogeneous forms\nare presented. The chiral invariance of the massless discrete Dirac-K\\\"{a}hler\nequation is shown. Moreover, in the massive case we prove that a discrete\nDirac-K\\\"{a}hler operator flips the chirality.\n", "  We obtain a general connection between a quantum advantage in communication\ncomplexity and non-locality. We show that given any protocol offering a\n(sufficiently large) quantum advantage in communication complexity, there\nexists a way of obtaining measurement statistics which violate some Bell\ninequality. Our main tool is port-based teleportation. If the gap between\nquantum and classical communication complexity can grow arbitrarily large, the\nratio of the quantum value to the classical value of the Bell quantity becomes\nunbounded with the increase in the number of inputs and outputs.\n", "  In this work we investigate a phase field model for damage processes in\ntwo-dimensional viscoelastic media with nonhomogeneous Neumann data describing\nexternal boundary forces. In the first part we establish global-in-time\nexistence, uniqueness, a priori estimates and continuous dependence of strong\nsolutions on the data. The main difficulty is caused by the irreversibility of\nthe phase field variable which results in a constrained PDE system. In the last\npart we consider an optimal control problem where a cost functional penalizes\nmaximal deviations from prescribed damage profiles. The goal is to minimize the\ncost functional with respect to exterior forces acting on the boundary which\nplay the role of the control variable in the considered model. To this end, we\nprove existence of minimizers and study a family of \"local\" approximations via\nadapted cost functionals.\n", "  Complex mesoscopic systems play increasingly important roles in modern\nscience -- from understanding biological functions at the molecular level, to\ndesigning solid-state information processing devices. The operation of these\nsystems typically depends on their energetic structure, yet probing their\nenergy-landscape can be extremely challenging; they have many degrees of\nfreedom, which may be hard to isolate and measure independently. Here we show\nthat a qubit (a two-level quantum system) with a biased energy-splitting can\ndirectly probe the spectral properties of a complex system, without knowledge\nof how they couple. Our work is based on the completely-positive and\ntrace-preserving map formalism, which treats any unknown dynamics as a\n`black-box' process. This black box contains information about the system with\nwhich the probe interacts, which we access by measuring the survival\nprobability of the initial state of the probe as function of the\nenergy-splitting and the process time. Fourier transforming the results yields\nthe energy spectrum of the complex system. Without making assumptions about the\nstrength or form of its coupling, our probe could determine aspects of a\ncomplex molecule's energy landscape as well as, in many cases, test for\ncoherent superposition of its energy eigenstates.\n", "  One-dimensional electronic fluids are peculiar conducting systems, where the\nfundamental role of interactions leads to exotic, emergent phenomena, such as\nspin-charge (spinon-holon) separation. The distinct low-energy properties of\nthese 1D metals are successfully described within the theory of linear\nLuttinger liquids, but the challenging task of describing their high-energy\nnonlinear properties has long remained elusive. Recently, novel theoretical\napproaches accounting for nonlinearity have been developed, yet the rich\nphenomenology that they predict remains barely explored experimentally. Here,\nwe probe the nonlinear spectral characteristics of short GaAs quantum wires by\ntunnelling spectroscopy, using an advanced device consisting of 6000 wires. We\nfind evidence for the existence of an inverted (spinon) shadow band in the main\nregion of the particle sector, one of the central predictions of the new\nnonlinear theories. A (holon) band with reduced effective mass is clearly\nvisible in the particle sector at high energies.\n", "  Same-sex sexual behavior is ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, but its\nadaptive origins remain a prominent puzzle. Here I suggest the possibility that\nsame-sex sexual behavior arises as a consequence of the competition between an\nevolutionary drive for a wide diversity in traits, which improves the\nadaptability of a species, and a drive for sexual dichotomization of traits,\nwhich promotes opposite-sex attraction and increases the rate of reproduction.\nA simple analytical \"toy model\" is proposed for describing this tradeoff. The\nmodel exhibits a number of interesting features, and suggests a simple\nmathematical form for describing the sexual orientation continuum.\n", "  The experimentally observed spectra of heavy vector meson radial excitations\nshow a dependence on two different energy parameters. One is associated with\nthe quark mass and the other with the binding energy levels of the quark\nanti-quark pair. The first is present in the large mass of the first state\nwhile the other corresponds to the small mass splittings between radial\nexcitations. In this article we show how to reproduce such a behavior with\nreasonable precision using a holographic model. In the dual picture, the large\nenergy scale shows up from a bulk mass and the small scale comes from the\nposition of anti-de Sitter (AdS) space where field correlators are calculated.\nThe model determines the masses of four observed S-wave states of charmonium\nand six S-wave states of bottomonium with , 6.1 % rms error. In consistency\nwith the physical picture, the large energy parameter is flavor dependent,\nwhile the small parameter, associated with quark anti-quark interaction is the\nsame for charmonium and bottomonium states.\n", "  A quantum particle evolving by Schr\\\"odinger's equation contains, from the\nkinetic energy of the particle, a term in its Hamiltonian proportional to\nLaplace's operator. In discrete space, this is replaced by the discrete or\ngraph Laplacian, which gives rise to a continuous-time quantum walk. Besides\nthis natural definition, some quantum walk algorithms instead use the adjacency\nmatrix to effect the walk. While this is equivalent to the Laplacian for\nregular graphs, it is different for non-regular graphs, and is thus an\ninequivalent quantum walk. We algorithmically explore this distinction by\nanalyzing search on the complete bipartite graph with multiple marked vertices,\nusing both the Laplacian and adjacency matrix. The two walks differ\nqualitatively and quantitatively in their required jumping rate, runtime,\nsampling of marked vertices, and in what constitutes a natural initial state.\nThus the choice of the Laplacian or adjacency matrix to effect the walk has\nimportant algorithmic consequences.\n", "  We consider flux compactifications of type IIB string theory and F-theory in\nwhich the respective superpotentials at large complex structure are dominated\nby cubic or quartic terms in the complex structure moduli. In this limit, the\nlow-energy effective theory for the complex structure and axio-dilaton sector\nexhibits universal properties that are insensitive to the details of the\ncompactification manifold or the flux configuration. We show that there are no\nvacua in this region and the spectrum of the Hessian matrix is highly peaked\nand consists only of three distinct eigenvalues ($0$, $2m_{3/2}^2$ and\n$8m_{3/2}^2$), independently of the number of moduli. We briefly comment on how\nthe inclusion of K\\\"ahler moduli affect these findings. Our results generalise\nthose of Brodie & Marsh [1], in which these universal properties were found in\na subspace of the large complex structure limit of type IIB compactifications.\n", "  We investigate the interaction between the electrons of a two-dimensional\nmetal and the acoustic phonons of an underlying piezoelectric substrate.\nFundamental inequalities can be obtained from general energy arguments. As a\nresult, phonon mediated attraction can be proven to never overcome electron\nCoulomb repulsion, at least for long phonon wavelengths. We study the influence\nof these phonons on the possible pairing instabilities of a two-dimensional\nelectron gas such as graphene.\n", "  Under adequate conditions, cavity-polaritons form a macroscopic coherent\nquantum state, known as Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Compared to\nWannier-Mott excitons in inorganic semiconductors, the localized Frenkel\nexcitons in organic emitter materials show weaker interaction but stronger\ncoupling, which recently enabled the first realization of BEC at room\ntemperature. However, this required ultrafast optical pumping which limits the\napplications of organic BECs. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature BEC of\ncavity-polaritons in simple laminated microcavities filled with the\nbiologically produced enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). The unique\nmolecular structure of eGFP prevents exciton annihilation even at high\nexcitation densities, thus facilitating BEC under conventional nanosecond\npumping. BEC is clearly evidenced by a distinct threshold, an\ninteraction-induced blueshift of the condensate, long-range coherence and the\npresence of a second threshold at higher excitation density which is associated\nwith the onset of photon lasing and results from thermalization of the exciton\nreservoir.\n", "  In this work, we study the pattern solutions of doubly nonlocal logistic map\nthat include spatial kernels in both growth and competition terms. We show that\nthis map includes as a particular case the nonlocal Fisher-Kolmogorov equation,\nand we demonstrate the existence of three kinds of stationary nonlinear\nsolutions: one uniform, one cosine type that we refer to as wavelike solution,\nand another in the form of Gaussian. We also obtain analytical expressions that\ndescribe the nonlinear pattern behavior in the system, and we establish the\nstability criterion. We define thermodynamics grandeurs such as entropy and the\norder parameter. Based on this, the pattern-no-pattern and pattern-pattern\ntransitions are properly analyzed. We show that these pattern solutions may be\nrelated to the recently observed peak adding phenomenon in nonlinear optics.\n", "  The many-body problem is ubiquitous in the theoretical description of\nphysical phenomena, ranging from the behavior of elementary particles to the\nphysics of electrons in solids. Most of our understanding of many-body systems\ncomes from analyzing the symmetry properties of Hamiltonian and states: the\nmost striking example are gauge theories such as quantum electrodynamics, where\na local symmetry strongly constrains the microscopic dynamics. The physics of\nsuch gauge theories is relevant for the understanding of a diverse set of\nsystems, including frustrated quantum magnets and the collective dynamics of\nelementary particles within the standard model. In the last few years, several\napproaches have been put forward to tackle the complex dynamics of gauge\ntheories using quantum information concepts. In particular, quantum simulation\nplatforms have been put forward for the realization of synthetic gauge\ntheories, and novel classical simulation algorithms based on quantum\ninformation concepts have been formulated. In this review we present an\nintroduction to these approaches, illustrating the basics concepts and\nhighlighting the connections between apparently very different fields, and\nreport the recent developments in this new thriving field of research.\n", "  We study the time evolution of a single species positive plasma, confined in\na cylinder and having infinite charge. We extend the result of a previous work\nby the same authors, for a plasma density having compact support in the\nvelocities, to the case of a density having unbounded support and gaussian\ndecay in the velocities.\n", "  It has been recently suggested~\\cite{Berezhiani:2015yta} that emerging\ntension between cosmological parameter values derived in high-redshift (CMB\nanisotropy) and low-redshift (cluster counts, Hubble constant) measurements can\nbe reconciled in a model which contains subdominant fraction of dark matter\ndecaying after recombination. We check the model against the CMB Planck data.\nWe find that lensing of the CMB anisotropies by the large-scale structure gives\nstrong extra constraints on this model, limiting the fraction as $F<8\\%$ at\n2\\,$\\sigma$ confidence level. However, investigating the combined data set of\nCMB and conflicting low-$z$ measurements, we obtain that the model with\n$F\\approx2\\!-\\!5$\\% exhibits better fit (by 1.5-3\\,$\\sigma$ depending on the\nlensing priors) compared to that of the concordance $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological\nmodel.\n", "  In this paper we present a scenario where the stability of dark matter and\nthe phenomenology of neutrinos are related by the spontaneous breaking of a\nnon-Abelian flavor symmetry. In this scenario the breaking is done at the\nseesaw scale, in such a way that what remains of the flavor symmetry is a Z2\nsymmetry, which stabilizes the dark matter. We have proposed two models based\non this idea, for which we have calculated their neutrino mass matrices\nachieving two-zero texture in both cases. Accordingly, we have updated this\ntwo-zero texture phenomenology finding an interesting correlation between the\nreactor mixing angle and the sum of the light neutrino masses. We also have a\ncorrelation between the lightest neutrino mass and the neutrinoless double beta\ndecay effective mass, obtaining a lower bound for the effective mass within the\nregion of the nearly future experimental sensitivities.\n", "  We show that the Planck 2015 and BICEP2/KECK measurements of the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) anisotropies provide together an information gain of\n0.82 +- 0.13 bits on the reheating history over all slow-roll single-field\nmodels of inflation. This corresponds to a 40% improvement compared to the\nPlanck 2013 constraints on the reheating. Our method relies on an exhaustive\nCMB data analysis performed over nearly 200 models of inflation to derive the\nKullback-Leibler entropy between the prior and the fully marginalized posterior\nof the reheating parameter. This number is a weighted average by the Bayesian\nevidence of each model to explain the data thereby ensuring its fairness and\nrobustness.\n", "  We propose an engineering of the optical properties of GaAs/AlGaAs quantum\nwells using AlAs and InAs monolayer insertions. A quantitative study of the\neffects of the monolayer position and the well thickness on the interband and\nintersubband transitions, based on the extended-basis sp3d5s* tight-binding\nmodel, is presented. The effect of insertion on the interband transitions is\ncompared with existing experimental data. As for intersubband transitions, we\nshow that in a GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well including two AlAs and one InAs\ninsertions, a three level {e1 , e2 , e3 } system where the transition energy\ne3-e2 is lower and the transition energy e2-e1 larger than the longitudinal\noptical phonon energy (36 meV) can be engineered together with a e3-e2\ntransition energy widely tunable through the TeraHertz range.\n", "  There is a commonality among contagious diseases, tweets, urban crimes,\nnuclear reactions, and neuronal firings that past events facilitate the future\noccurrence of events. The spread of events has been extensively studied such\nthat the systems exhibit catastrophic chain reactions if the interaction\nrepresented by the ratio of reproduction exceeds unity; however, their\nsubthreshold states for the case of the weaker interaction are not fully\nunderstood. Here, we report that these systems are possessed by nonstationary\ncascades of event-occurrences already in the subthreshold regime. Event\ncascades can be harmful in some contexts, when the peak-demand causes vaccine\nshortages, heavy traffic on communication lines, frequent crimes, or large\nfluctuations in nuclear reactions, but may be beneficial in other contexts,\nsuch that spontaneous activity in neural networks may be used to generate\nmotion or store memory. Thus it is important to comprehend the mechanism by\nwhich such cascades appear, and consider controlling a system to tame or\nfacilitate fluctuations in the event-occurrences. The critical interaction for\nthe emergence of cascades depends greatly on the network structure in which\nindividuals are connected. We demonstrate that we can predict whether cascades\nmay emerge in a network, given information about the interactions between\nindividuals. Furthermore, we develop a method of reallocating connections among\nindividuals so that event cascades may be either impeded or impelled in a\nnetwork.\n", "  An explicit Robinson--Trautman solution with minimally coupled free scalar\nfield was derived and analyzed recently. It was shown that this solution\npossesses a curvature singularity which is initially naked but later enveloped\nby a horizon. However, this study concentrated on the general branch of the\nsolution where all free constants are nonzero. Interesting special cases arise\nwhen some of the parameters are set to zero. In most of these cases the scalar\nfield is still present. One of the cases is a static solution which represents\na parametric limit of the Janis--Newman--Winicour scalar field spacetime.\nAdditionally, we provide a calculation of the Bondi mass which clarifies the\ninterpretation of the general solution. Finally, by a complex rotation of a\nparameter describing the strength of the scalar field we obtain a dynamical\nwormhole solution.\n", "  We construct time-dependent one-dimensional (vertically averaged) models of\naccretion disks produced by the tidal disruption of a white dwarf (WD) by a\nbinary neutron star (NS) companion. Nuclear reactions in the disk midplane burn\nthe WD matter to increasingly heavier elements at sequentially smaller radii,\nreleasing substantial energy which can impact the disk dynamics. A model for\ndisk outflows is employed, by which cooling from the outflow balances other\nsources of heating (viscous, nuclear) in regulating the Bernoulli parameter of\nthe midplane to a fixed value $\\lesssim 0$. We perform a comprehensive\nparameter study of the compositional yields and velocity distributions of the\ndisk outflows for WDs of different initial compositions. For C/O WDs, the\nradial composition profile of the disk evolves self-similarly in a\nquasi-steady-state manner, and is remarkably robust to model parameters. The\nnucleosynthesis in helium WD disks does not exhibit this behavior, which\ninstead depends sensitively on factors controlling the disk midplane density\n(e.g. the strength of the viscosity, $\\alpha$). By the end of the simulation, a\nsubstantial fraction of the WD mass is unbound in outflows at characteristic\nvelocities of $\\sim 10^9~{\\rm cm~s}^{-1}$. The outflows from WD-NS merger disks\ncontain $10^{-4}-3 \\times 10^{-3} M_\\odot$ of radioactive $^{56}$Ni, resulting\nin fast ($\\sim$ week long) dim ($\\sim10^{40}~{\\rm erg~s}^{-1}$) optical\ntransients; shock heating of the ejecta by late time outflows may increase the\npeak luminosity to $\\sim 10^{43}~{\\rm erg~s}^{-1}$. The accreted mass onto the\nneutron star is probably not sufficient to induce gravitational collapse, but\nmay be capable of spinning up the NS to periods of $\\sim 10~{\\rm ms}$. This is\na new possible channel for forming isolated recycled pulsars.\n", "  We show that renormalization group(RG) flow can be viewed as a gradual wave\nfunction collapse, where a quantum state associated with the action of field\ntheory evolves toward a final state that describes an IR fixed point. The\nprocess of collapse is described by the radial evolution in the dual\nholographic theory. If the theory is in the same phase as the assumed IR fixed\npoint, the initial state is smoothly projected to the final state. If in a\ndifferent phase, the initial state undergoes a phase transition which in turn\ngives rise to a horizon in the bulk geometry. We demonstrate the connection\nbetween critical behavior and horizon in an example, by deriving the bulk\nmetrics that emerge in various phases of the U(N) vector model in the large N\nlimit based on the holographic dual constructed from quantum RG. The gapped\nphase exhibits a geometry that smoothly ends at a finite proper distance in the\nradial direction. The geometric distance in the radial direction measures a\ncomplexity : the depth of RG transformation that is needed to project the\ngenerally entangled UV state to a direct product state in the IR. For gapless\nstates, entanglement persistently spreads out to larger length scales, and the\ninitial state can not be projected to the direct product state. The obstruction\nto smooth projection at charge neutral point manifests itself as the long\nthroat in the anti-de Sitter space. The Poincare horizon at infinity marks the\ncritical point which exhibits a divergent length scale in the spread of\nentanglement. For the gapless states with non-zero chemical potential, the bulk\nspace becomes the Lifshitz geometry with the dynamical critical exponent two.\nThe identification of horizon as critical point may provide an explanation for\nthe universality of horizon. We also discuss the structure of the bulk tensor\nnetwork that emerges from the quantum RG.\n", "  We investigate multi-\"photon\" interband excitation processes in an optical\nlattice that is driven periodically in time by a modulation of the lattice\ndepth. Assuming the system to be prepared in the lowest band, we compute the\nexcitation spectrum numerically. Moreover, we estimate the effective coupling\nparameters for resonant interband excitation processes analytically, employing\ndegenerate perturbation theory in Floquet space. We find that below a threshold\ndriving strength, interband excitations are suppressed exponentially with\nrespect to the inverse driving frequency. For sufficiently low frequencies,\nthis leads to a rather sudden onset of interband heating, once the driving\nstrength reaches the threshold. We argue that this behavior is rather generic\nand should also be found in lattice systems that are driven by other forms of\nperiodic forcing. Our results are relevant for Floquet engineering, where a\nlattice system is driven periodically in time in order to endow it with novel\nproperties like the emergence of a strong artificial magnetic field or a\ntopological band structure. In this context, interband excitation processes\ncorrespond to detrimental heating.\n", "  We find unknown $s$- and $d$-wave amplitudes of the recently discovered\ncharge density wave (CDW) in underdoped cuprates. To do so we perform a\ncombined analysis of experimental data for ortho-II YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{y}$. The\nanalysis includes data on nuclear magnetic resonance, resonant inelastic X-ray\nscattering, and hard X-ray diffraction. The amplitude of doping modulation\nfound in our analysis is $3.5\\cdot 10^{-3}$ in a low magnetic field and\n$T=60$K, the amplitude is $6.5\\cdot 10^{-3}$ in a magnetic field of 30T and\n$T=1.3$K. The values are in units of elementary charge per unit cell of a\nCuO$_2$ plane. We show that the data rule out a checkerboard pattern, and we\nalso show that the data might rule out mechanisms of the CDW which do not\ninclude phonons.\n", "  The Ostrogradsky theorem implies that higher-derivative terms of a single\nmechanical variable are either trivial or lead to additional, ghost-like\ndegrees of freedom. In this letter we systematically investigate how the\nintroduction of additional variables can remedy this situation. Employing a\nLagrangian analysis, we identify conditions on the Lagrangian to ensure the\nexistence of primary and secondary constraints that together imply the absence\nof Ostrogradsky ghosts. We also show the implications of these conditions for\nthe structure of the equations of motion as well as possible redefinitions of\nthe variables. We discuss applications to analogous higher-derivative field\ntheories such as multi-Galileons and beyond Horndeski.\n", "  Laplace pressure driven snap-off is a technique that is used to produce\ndroplets for emulsions and microfluidics purposes. Previous predictions of\ndroplet size have assumed a quasi-equilibrium low flow limit. We present a\nsimple model to predict droplet sizes over a wide range of flow rates,\ndemonstrating a rich landscape of droplet stability depending on droplet size\nand growth rate. The model accounts for the easily adjusted experimental\nparameters of geometry, interfacial tension, and the viscosities of both\nphases.\n", "  We present late-time optical spectroscopy taken with the Large Binocular\nTelescope's Multi-Object Double Spectrograph, an improved ASAS-SN pre-discovery\nnon-detection, and late-time SWIFT observations of the nearby ($d=193$ Mpc,\n$z=0.0436$) tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-14ae. Our observations span\nfrom $\\sim$20 days before to $\\sim$750 days after discovery. The proximity of\nASASSN-14ae allows us to study the optical evolution of the flare and the\ntransition to a host dominated state with exceptionally high precision. We\nmeasure very weak H$\\alpha$ emission 300 days after discovery ($L_{\\rm H\\alpha}\n\\simeq 4\\times 10^{39}$ ergs s$^{-1}$) and the most stringent upper limit to\ndate on the H$\\alpha$ luminosity $\\sim$750 days after discovery ($L_{\\rm\nH\\alpha} \\lesssim 10^{39}$ ergs s$^{-1}$), suggesting that the optical emission\narising from a TDE can vanish on a timescale as short as 1 year. Our results\nhave important implications for both spectroscopic detection of TDE candidates\nat late times, as well as the nature of TDE host galaxies themselves.\n", "  We study the influence of narrowed distributions of the nuclear Overhauser\nfield on the decoherence of a central electron spin in quantum dots. We\ndescribe the spin dynamics in quantum dots by the central spin model. We use\nanalytic solutions for uniform couplings and the time dependent density-matrix\nrenormalization group (tDMRG) for nonuniform couplings. With these tools we\ncalculate the dynamics of the central spin for large baths of nuclear spins\nwith or without external magnetic field applied to the central spin. The focus\nof our study is the influence of initial mixtures with narrowed distributions\nof the Overhauser field and of applied magnetic fields on the decoherence of\nthe central spin.\n", "  In this work we present a generalization of the recently developed Hardy-like\nlogical proof of contextuality and of the so-called KCBS contextuality\ninequality for any qudit of dimension greater than three. Our approach uses\ncompatibility graphs that can only be satisfied by qudits. We find a\nconstruction for states and measurements that satisfy these graphs and\ndemonstrate both logical and inequality based contextuality for qudits.\nInterestingly, the quantum violation of the inequality is constant as dimension\nincreases. We also discuss the issue of imprecision in experimental\nimplementations of contextuality tests and a way of addressing this problem\nusing the notion of ontological faithfulness.\n", "  An optically levitated nanoparticle in vacuum is a paradigm optomechanical\nsystem for sensing and studying macroscopic quantum mechanics. While its\ncenter-of-mass motion has been investigated intensively, its torsional\nvibration has only been studied theoretically in limited cases. Here we report\nthe first experimental observation of the torsional vibration of an optically\nlevitated nonspherical nanoparticle in vacuum. We achieve this by utilizing the\ncoupling between the spin angular momentum of photons and the torsional\nvibration of a nonspherical nanoparticle whose polarizability is a tensor. The\ntorsional vibration frequency can be one order of magnitude higher than its\ncenter-of-mass motion frequency, which is promising for ground state cooling.\nWe propose a simple yet novel scheme to achieve ground state cooling of its\ntorsional vibration with a linearly-polarized Gaussian cavity mode. A levitated\nnonspherical nanoparticle in vacuum will also be an ultrasensitive nanoscale\ntorsion balance with a torque detection sensitivity on the order of $10^{-29}\n~\\mathrm{N}\\cdot \\mathrm{m}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{ Hz}}$ under realistic conditions.\n", "  Cat states are coherent quantum superpositions of macroscopically distinct\nstates and are useful for understanding the boundary between the classical and\nthe quantum world. Due to their macroscopic nature, cat states are difficult to\nprepare in physical systems. We propose a method to create cat states in\none-dimensional quantum walks using delocalized initial states of the walker.\nSince the quantum walks can be performed on any quantum system, our proposal\nenables a platform-independent realization of the cat states. We further show\nthat the linear dispersion relation of the effective quantum walk Hamiltonian,\nwhich governs the dynamics of the delocalized states, is responsible for the\nformation of the cat states. We analyze the robustness of these states against\nenvironmental interactions and present methods to control and manipulate the\ncat states in the photonic implementation of quantum walks.\n", "  The rules that govern spin exchange interaction in pristine graphene\nnanostructures are constrained by the bipartite character of the lattice, so\nthat the sign of the exchange is determined by whether magnetic moments are on\nthe same sublattice or else. The synthesis of graphene ribbons with perfect\nzigzag edges and a fluoranthene group with a pentagon ring, a defect that\nbreaks the bipartite nature of the honeycomb lattice, has been recently\ndemonstrated. Here we address how the electronic and spin properties of these\nstructures are modified by such defects, both for indirect exchange\ninteractions as well as the emergent edge magnetism, studied both with DFT and\nmean field Hubbard model calculations. In all instances we find that the local\nbreakdown of the bipartite nature at the defect reverts the sign of the\notherwise ferromagnetic correlations along the edge, introducing a locally\nantiferromagnetic intra-edge coupling and, for narrow ribbons, also revert the\nantiferromagnetic inter-edge interactions that are normally found in pristine\nribbons. Our findings show that these pentagon defects are a resource that\npermits to engineer the spin exchange interactions in graphene based\nnano-structures.\n", "  Combined ATLAS and CMS measurements of the Higgs boson production and decay\nrates, as well as constraints on its couplings to vector bosons and fermions,\nare presented. The combination is based on the analysis of five production\nprocesses, namely gluon fusion, vector boson fusion, and associated production\nwith a $W$ or a $Z$ boson or a pair of top quarks, and of the six decay modes\n$H \\to ZZ, WW$, $\\gamma\\gamma, \\tau\\tau, bb$, and $\\mu\\mu$. All results are\nreported assuming a value of 125.09 GeV for the Higgs boson mass, the result of\nthe combined measurement by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. The analysis uses\nthe CERN LHC proton--proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS and CMS\nexperiments in 2011 and 2012, corresponding to integrated luminosities per\nexperiment of approximately 5 fb$^{-1}$ at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV and 20 fb$^{-1}$ at\n$\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV. The Higgs boson production and decay rates measured by the\ntwo experiments are combined within the context of three generic\nparameterisations: two based on cross sections and branching fractions, and one\non ratios of coupling modifiers. Several interpretations of the measurements\nwith more model-dependent parameterisations are also given. The combined signal\nyield relative to the Standard Model prediction is measured to be 1.09 $\\pm$\n0.11. The combined measurements lead to observed significances for the vector\nboson fusion production process and for the $H \\to \\tau\\tau$ decay of $5.4$ and\n$5.5$ standard deviations, respectively. The data are consistent with the\nStandard Model predictions for all parameterisations considered.\n", "  We present a method to calculate the Landau levels and the corresponding edge\nstates of two dimensional (2D) crystals using as a starting point their\nelectronic structure as obtained from standard density functional theory (DFT).\nThe DFT Hamiltonian is represented in the basis of maximally localized Wannier\nfunctions. This defines a tight-binding Hamiltonian for the bulk that can be\nused to describe other structures, such as ribbons, provided that atomic scale\ndetails of the edges are ignored. The effect of the orbital magnetic field is\ndescribed using the Peierls substitution in the hopping matrix elements.\nImplementing this approach in a ribbon geometry, we obtain both the Landau\nlevels and the dispersive edge states for a series of 2D crystals, including\ngraphene, Boron Nitride, MoS$_2$ , Black Phosphorous, Indium Selenide and\nMoO$_3$ . Our procedure can readily be used in any other 2D crystal, and\nprovides an alternative to effective mass descriptions.\n", "  For random L\\'evy matrices of size $N \\times N$, where matrix elements are\ndrawn with some heavy-tailed distribution $P(H_{ij}) \\propto N^{-1} |H_{ij}\n|^{-1-\\mu}$ with $0<\\mu<2$ (infinite variance), there exists an extensive\nnumber of finite eigenvalues $E=O(1)$, while the maximal eigenvalue grows as\n$E_{max} \\sim N^{\\frac{1}{\\mu}}$. Here we study the localization properties of\nthe corresponding eigenvectors via some strong disorder perturbative expansion\nthat remains consistent within the localized phase and that yields their\nInverse Participation Ratios (I.P.R.) $Y_q$ as a function of the continuous\nparameter $0<q<+\\infty$. In the region $0<\\mu<1$, we find that all eigenvectors\nare localized but display some multifractality : the IPR are finite above some\nthreshold $q>q_c$ but diverge in the region $0<q<q_c$ near the origin. In the\nregion $1<\\mu<2$, only the sub-extensive fraction $N^{\\frac{3}{2+\\mu}}$ of the\nbiggest eigenvalues corresponding to the region $| E| \\geq\nN^{\\frac{(\\mu-1)}{\\mu(2+\\mu)}} $ remains localized, while the extensive number\nof other states of smaller energy are delocalized. For the extensive number of\nfinite eigenvalues $E=O(1)$, the localization/delocalization transition thus\ntakes place at the critical value $\\mu_c=1$ corresponding to Cauchy matrices :\nthe Inverse Participation Ratios $Y_q$ of the corresponding critical\neigenstates follow the Strong-Multifractality Spectrum characterized by the\ngeneralized fractal dimensions $D^{criti}(q) = \\frac{1-2q}{1-q} \\theta (0 \\leq\nq \\leq \\frac{1}{2})$, which has been found previously in various other\nLocalization problems in spaces of effective infinite dimensionality.\n", "  We use an $sp^3d^5s^* $ tight-binding model to investigate the electronic and\noptical properties of realistic site-controlled (111)-oriented InGaAs/GaAs\nquantum dots. Special attention is paid to the impact of random alloy\nfluctuations on key factors that determine the fine-structure splitting in\nthese systems. Using a pure InAs/GaAs quantum dot as a reference system, we\nshow that the combination of spin-orbit coupling and biaxial strain effects can\nlead to sizeable spin-splitting effects in these systems. Then, a realistic\nalloyed InGaAs/GaAs quantum dot with 25\\% InAs content is studied. Our analysis\nreveals that the impact of random alloy fluctuations on the electronic and\noptical properties of (111)-oriented InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots reduces strongly\nas the lateral size of the dot increases and approaches realistic sizes. For\ninstance the optical matrix element shows an almost vanishing anisotropy in the\n(111)-growth plane. Furthermore, conduction and valence band mixing effects in\nthe system under consideration are strongly reduced compared to standard\n(100)-oriented InGaAs/GaAs systems. All these factors strongly indicate a\nreduced fine structure splitting in site-controlled (111)-oriented InGaAs/GaAs\nquantum dots. Thus, we conclude that quantum dots with realistic (50-80~nm)\nbase length represent promising candidates for polarization entangled photon\ngeneration, consistent with recent experimental data.\n", "  We propose an aqueous functionalized molybdenum disulfide nanoribbon\nsuspended over a solid electrode as the first capacitive displacement sensor\naimed at determining the DNA sequence. The detectable sequencing events arise\nfrom the combination of Watson-Crick base-pairing, one of nature's most basic\nlock-and-key-binding mechanisms, with the ability of appropriately sized\natomically thin membranes to flex substantially in response to sub-nanonewton\nforces. We employ carefully designed numerical simulations and theoretical\nestimates to demonstrate excellent (79 % to 86 %) raw target detection accuracy\nat ~70 million bases per second and electrical measurability of the detected\nevents. In addition, we demonstrate reliable detection of repeated DNA motifs.\nFinally, we argue that the use of a nanoscale opening (nanopore) is not\nrequisite for the operation of the proposed sensor and present a simplified\nsensor geometry without the nanopore as part of the sensing element. Our\nresults therefore potentially suggest a realistic, inherently base-specific,\nhigh-throughput electronic DNA sequencing device as a cost-effective de-novo\nalternative to the existing methods.\n", "  We present a system of coordinates deriving directly from the so-called\nGeodesic Light-Cone (GLC) coordinates and made of two null scalars intersecting\non a 2-dimensional sphere parameterized by two constant angles along geodesics.\nThese coordinates are shown to be equivalent to the well-known double-null\ncoordinates. As GLC, they present interesting properties for cosmology and\nastrophysics. We discuss this latter topic for static black holes, showing\nsimple descriptions for the metric or particles and photons trajectories. We\nalso briefly comment on the time of flight of ultra-relativistic particles.\n", "  We study the non-linearly realized spontaneously broken supersymmetry of the\n(anti-)D3-brane action in type IIB string theory. The worldvolume fields are\none vector $A_\\mu$, three complex scalars $\\phi^i$ and four 4d fermions\n$\\lambda^0$, $\\lambda^i$. These transform, in addition to the more familiar N=4\nlinear supersymmetry, also under 16 spontaneously broken, non-linearly realized\nsupersymmetries. We argue that the worldvolume fields can be packaged into the\nfollowing constrained 4d non-linear N=1 multiplets: four chiral multiplets $S$,\n$Y^i$ that satisfy $S^2=SY^i=0$ and contain the worldvolume fermions\n$\\lambda^0$ and $\\lambda^i$; and four chiral multiplets $W_\\alpha$, $H^i$ that\nsatisfy $S W_\\alpha=0$ and $S \\bar D_{\\dot \\alpha} \\bar H^{\\bar \\imath}=0$ and\ncontain the vector $A_\\mu$ and the scalars $\\phi^i$. We also discuss how\nplacing an anti-D3-brane on top of intersecting O7-planes can lead to an\northogonal multiplet $\\Phi$ that satisfies $S(\\Phi-\\bar \\Phi)=0$, which is\nparticularly interesting for inflationary cosmology.\n", "  We study time evolution of distance between thermal states excited by local\noperators, with different external couplings. We find that growth of the\ndistance implies growth of commutators of operators, signifying the local\nexcitations are scrambled. We confirm this growth of distance by holographic\ncomputation, by evaluating volume of codimension 1 extremal volume surface. We\nfind that the distance increases exponentially as $e^{\\frac{2\\pi t}{\\beta}}$.\nOur result implies that, in chaotic system, trajectories of excited thermal\nstates exhibit high sensitivity to perturbation to the Hamiltonian, and the\ndistance between them will be significant at the scrambling time. We also\nconfirm the decay of two point function of holographic Wilson loops on\nthermofield double state.\n", "  We investigate the nucleation and propagation of cracks in self-assembled\nviscoelastic fluids, which are made of surfactant micelles reversibly linked by\ntelechelic polymers. The morphology of the micelles can be continuously tuned,\nfrom spherical to rod-like to wormlike, thus producing transient double\nnetworks when the micelles are sufficiently long and entangled, and transient\nsingle networks otherwise. For a single network, we show that cracks nucleate\nwhen the sample deformation rate involved is comparable to the relaxation time\nscale of the network. For a double network, by contrast, significant\nrearrangements of the micelles occur as a crack nucleates and propagates. We\nshow that birefringence develops at the crack tip over a finite length, $\\xi$,\nwhich corresponds to the length scale over which micelles alignment occur. We\nfind that $\\xi$ is larger for slower cracks, suggesting an increase of\nductility.\n", "  We propose a highly efficient thermoelectric diode device built from the\ncoupling of a quantum dot with a normal or ferromagnetic electrode and a\nsuperconducting reservoir. The current shows a strongly nonlinear behavior in\nthe forward direction (positive thermal gradients) while it almost vanishes in\nthe backward direction (negative thermal gradients). Our discussion is\nsupported by a gauge-invariant current-conserving transport theory accounting\nfor electron-electron interactions inside the dot. We find that the diode\nbehavior is greatly tuned with external gate potentials, Zeeman splittings or\nlead magnetizations. Our results are thus relevant for the search of novel\nthermoelectric devices with enhanced functionalities.\n", "  We propose a model that accounts for the budding transition of asymmetric\ntwo-component lipid domains, where the two monolayers (leaflets) have different\naverage compositions controlled by independent chemical potentials. Assuming a\ncoupling between the local curvature and local lipid composition in each of the\nleaflets, we discuss the morphology and thermodynamic behavior of asymmetric\nlipid domains. The membrane free-energy contains three contributions: the\nbending energy, the line tension, and a Landau free-energy for a lateral phase\nseparation. Within a mean-field treatment, we obtain various phase diagrams\ncontaining fully budded, dimpled, and flat states as a function of the two\nleaflet compositions. The global phase behavior is analyzed, and depending on\nsystem parameters, the phase diagrams include one-phase, two-phase and\nthree-phase regions. In particular, we predict various phase coexistence\nregions between different morphologies of domains, which may be observed in\nmulti-component membranes or vesicles.\n", "  We discuss the performance of a readout system, Fixed Pulse Shape Efficient\nReadout (FIPSER), to digitize signals from detectors with a fixed pulse shape.\nIn this study we are mainly interested in the readout of fast photon detectors\nlike photomultipliers or Silicon photomultipliers. But the concept can be\nequally applied to the digitization of other detector signals. FIPSER is based\non the flash analog to digital converter (FADC) concept, but has the potential\nto lower costs and power consumption by using an order of magnitude fewer\ndiscrete voltage levels. Performance is bolstered by combining the discretized\nsignal with the knowledge of the underlying pulse shape. Simulated FIPSER data\nwas reconstructed with two independent methods. One using a maximum likelihood\nmethod and the other using a modified chisquared test. Both methods show that\nutilizing 12 discrete voltage levels with a sampling rate of 4 samples per full\nwidth half maximum (FWHM) of the pulse achieves an amplitude resolution that is\nbetter than the Poisson limit for photon-counting experiments. The time\nresolution achieved in this configuration ranges between 0.02 - 0.16 FWHM and\ndepends on the pulse amplitude. In a situation where the waveform is composed\nof two consecutive pulses the pulses can be separated if they are at least 0.05\n- 0.30 FWHM apart with an amplitude resolution that is better than 20%.\n", "  Fundamental insight into the nature of the quantum phase transition from a\nsuperconductor to an insulator in two dimensions, or from one plateau to the\nnext or to an insulator in quantum Hall effect, has been revealed through the\nstudy of its scaling behavior. Here, we report on the experimental observation\nof a quantum phase transition from a quantum-anomalous-Hall (QAH) insulator to\nan Anderson insulator in a magnetic topological insulator by tuning the\nchemical potential. Our experiment demonstrates the existence of scaling\nbehavior from which we extract the critical exponent for this quantum phase\ntransition. We expect that our work will motivate much further investigation of\nmany properties of quantum phase transition in this new context.\n", "  A bottom-up chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process for the growth of\ngraphene nanomesh films is demonstrated. The process relies on silicon\nnanospheres to block nucleation sites for graphene CVD on copper substrates.\nThese spheres are formed in a self-organized way through silicon diffusion\nthrough a 5 $\\mu$m copper layer on a silicon wafer coated with 400 nm of\nsilicon nitride. The temperature during the growth process disintegrates the\n$Si_3$$N_4$ layer and silicon atoms diffuse to the copper surface, where they\nform the nanospheres. After graphene nanomesh growth, the Si nanospheres can be\nremoved by a simple hydrofluoric acid etch, leaving holes in the graphene film.\nThe nanomesh films have been successfully transferred to different substrates,\nincluding gas sensor test structures, and verified and characterized by Auger,\nTEM and SEM measurements. Electrical/gas-exposure measurements show a 2-fold\nincrease in ammonia sensitivity compared to plain graphene sensors. This\nimprovement can be explained by a higher adsorption site density (edge sites).\nThis new method for nanopatterned graphene is scalable, inexpensive and can be\ncarried out in standard semiconductor industry equipment. Furthermore, the\nsubstrates are reusable.\n", "  An accurate control of the optical properties of single crystal diamond\nduring microfabrication processes such as ion implantation plays a crucial role\nin the engineering of integrated photonic devices. In this work we present a\nsystematic study of the variation of both real and imaginary parts of the\nrefractive index of single crystal diamond, when damaged with 2 and 3 MeV\nprotons at low-medium fluences (range: 10^15 - 10^17 cm^-2). After implanting\nin 125x125 um^2 areas with a scanning ion microbeam, the variation of optical\npathlength of the implanted regions was measured with laser interferometric\nmicroscopy, while their optical transmission was studied using a spectrometric\nset-up with micrometric spatial resolution. On the basis of a model taking into\naccount the strongly non-uniform damage profile in the bulk sample, the\nvariation of the complex refractive index as a function of damage density was\nevaluated.\n", "  Clarification of the position of the Fermi level ($E_\\mathrm{F}$) is\nimportant in understanding the origin of ferromagnetism in the prototypical\nferromagnetic semiconductor Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$As (GaMnAs). In a recent\npublication, Souma $et$ $al$. [Sci. Rep. $\\mathbf{6}$, 27266 (2016)], have\ninvestigated the band structure and the $E_\\mathrm{F}$ position of GaMnAs using\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and concluded that\n$E_\\mathrm{F}$ is located in the valence band (VB). However, this conclusion\ncontradicts a number of recent experimental results for GaMnAs, which showed\nthat $E_\\mathrm{F}$ is located above the VB maximum in the impurity band (IB).\nHere, we show an alternative interpretation of their ARPES experiments, which\nis consistent with those recent experiments and supports the picture that\n$E_\\mathrm{F}$ is located above the VB maximum in the IB.\n", "  This paper presents the linear global stability analysis of the\nincompressible axisymmetric boundary layer on a circular cylinder. The base\nflow is parallel to the axis of the cylinder at inlet. The pressure gradient is\nzero in the streamwise direction. The base flow velocity profile is fully\nnon-parallel and non-similar in nature. The boundary layer grows continuously\nin the spatial directions. Linearized Navier-Stokes(LNS) equations are derived\nfor the disturbance flow quantities in the cylindrical polar coordinates. The\nLNS equations along with homogeneous boundary conditions forms a generalized\neigenvalues problem. Since the base flow is axisymmetric, the disturbances are\nperiodic in azimuthal direction. Chebyshev spectral collocation method and\nArnoldi's iterative algorithm is used for the solution of the general\neigenvalues problem. The global temporal modes are computed for the range of\nReynolds numbers and different azimuthal wave numbers. The largest imaginary\npart of the computed eigenmodes are negative and hence the flow is temporally\nstable. The spatial structure of the eigenmodes shows that the flow is\nconvectively unstable because the disturbance amplitudes grow in size and\nmagnitude when moving towards downstream. The global modes of axisymmetric\nboundary layer are more stable than that of 2D flat plate boundary layer at low\nReynolds number. However, at high Reynolds number they approaches to 2D flat\nplate boundary layer. Thus, the damping effect of transverse curvature is\nsignificant at low Reynolds number. The wave-like nature of the disturbances is\nfound for most unstable eigenmodes.\n", "  The connection between nuclear fusion in the Sun's core and solar irradiance\nis obscured among other things by uncertainty over the mechanism of coronal\nheating. Data for solar wind density and velocity, sunspot number, and EUV flux\nsuggest that electromagnetic energy from the Sun's convection zone is converted\nby induction through the chromosphere into thermal energy. The helium and\nhydrogen mixture exhaled by the Sun is then heated by the inverse Joule-Thomson\neffect when it expands via the corona into space. The almost complete shutdown\nof the solar wind on 10-11 May 1999 demonstrated that its velocity is a more\nfaithful indicator of solar activity than are sunspots as it reflects\nshort-term variations in coronal heating rather than quasicyclical fluctuations\nin the Sun's magnetism. Its reconstruction from the cosmic ray flux using\nisotopes spanning over 800,000 yr should therefore benefit the analysis and\nlong-term forecasting of Earth and space weather.\n", "  In this work, we propose a structured illumination (SI) method based on a\ntwo-photon excitation (TPE) scanning laser beam. Advantages of TPE methods\ninclude optical sectioning, low photo-toxicity, and robustness in the face of\nsample induced scattering. We designed a novel multi-spot point spread function\n(PSF) for a fast, two-photon scanning SIM microscope. Our multi-spot PSF is\ngenerated with a phase retrieval algorithm. We show how to obtain the phase\ndistribution and then simulate the effect of this distribution on a spatial\nlight modulator (SLM), which produces the multi-spot PSF in the object plane of\nthe microscope. We produce simulations that show the viability of this method.\nThe results are simulated and a multi-spot PSF scanning SIM microscope is\nproposed.\n", "  This manuscript is a collection of problems and solutions related to modeling\nthe cryosphere using the finite element software FEniCS. Included is an\nintroduction to the finite element method; solutions to a variety of problems\nin one, two, and three dimensions; an overview of popular stabilization\ntechniques for numerically-unstable problems; and an introduction to the\ngoverning equations of ice-sheet dynamics with associated FEniCS\nimplementations. The software developed for this project, Cryospheric Problem\nSolver (CSLVR), is fully open-source and has been designed with the goal of\nsimplifying many common tasks associated with modeling the cryosphere. CSLVR\npossesses the ability to download popular geological and geographical data,\neasily convert between geographical projections, develop sophisticated two- or\nthree-dimensional finite-element meshes, convert data between many popular\nformats, and produce production-quality images of data. Scripts are presented\nwhich model the flow of ice using geometry defined by mathematical functions\nand observed Antarctic and Greenland ice-sheets data. A new way of solving the\ninternal energy distribution of ice to match observed intra-ice water contents\nwithin temperate regions is thoroughly explained.\n", "  Using an effective one body approach we describe in detail gravitational\nwaves from classical three body problem on a non-rotating straight line and\nderive their basic physical characteristics. Special attention is paid to the\nirregular motions of such systems and to the significance of double and triple\ncollisions. The conclusive role of the collinear solutions is also discussed in\nshort. It is shown that the residuals may contain information about irregular\nmotion of the source of gravitational waves.\n", "  We introduce a new family of $N\\times N$ random real symmetric matrix\nensembles, the $k$-checkerboard matrices, whose limiting spectral measure has\ntwo components which can be determined explicitly. All but $k$ eigenvalues are\nin the bulk, and their behavior, appropriately normalized, converges to the\nsemi-circle as $N\\to\\infty$; the remaining $k$ are tightly constrained near\n$N/k$ and their distribution converges to the $k \\times k$ hollow GOE ensemble\n(this is the density arising by modifying the GOE ensemble by forcing all\nentries on the main diagonal to be zero). Similar results hold for complex and\nquaternionic analogues. We isolate the two regimes by using matrix perturbation\nresults and a nonstandard weight function for the eigenvalues, then derive\ntheir limiting distributions using a modification of the method of moments and\nanalysis of the resulting combinatorics.\n", "  In this paper we study various aspects of the double ramification (DR)\nhierarchy, introduced by the first author, and its quantization. We extend the\nnotion of tau-symmetry to quantum integrable hierarchies and prove that the\nquantum DR hierarchy enjoys this property. We determine explicitly the genus\n$1$ quantum correction and, as an application, compute completely the\nquantization of the $3$- and $4$-KdV hierarchies (the DR hierarchies for\nWitten's $3$- and $4$-spin theories). We then focus on the recursion relation\nsatisfied by the DR Hamiltonian densities and, abstracting from its geometric\norigin, we use it to characterize and construct a new family of quantum and\nclassical integrable systems which we call of double ramification type, as they\nsatisfy all of the main properties of the DR hierarchy. In the second part, we\nobtain new insight towards the Miura equivalence conjecture between the DR and\nDubrovin-Zhang hierarchies, via a geometric interpretation of the correlators\nforming the double ramification tau-function. We then show that the candidate\nMiura transformation between the DR and DZ hierarchies (which we uniquely\nidentified in our previous paper) indeed turns the Dubrovin-Zhang Poisson\nstructure into the standard form. Eventually, we focus on integrable\nhierarchies associated with rank-$1$ cohomological field theories and their\ndeformations, and we prove the DR/DZ equivalence conjecture up to genus $5$ in\nthis context.\n", "  To describe Lifshitz and hyperscaling violating (HSV) phenomena in CM one\nuses gauge fields on the gravity side which naturally realize the breaking of\nLorentz invariance. These gravity constructions often contain naked\nsingularities. In this thesis, we construct a resolution of the infra-red (IR)\nsingularity of the HSV background. The idea is to add squared curvature terms\nto the Einstein-Maxwell dilaton action to build a flow from $\\text{AdS}_4$ in\nthe ultra violate (UV) to an intermediating HSV region and then to an\n$\\text{AdS}_2 \\times {\\text{R}}^2$ region in the IR. This general solution is\nfree from the naked singularities and would be more appropriate for\napplications of HSV in physical systems.\n  We also study the Schwinger effect by using the AdS/CFT duality. We present\nthe phase diagrams of the Schwinger effect and also the \"butterfly shaped-phase\ndiagrams\" of the entanglement entropy for four different confining supergravity\nbackgrounds. Comparing different features of all of these diagrams could point\nout to a potential relation between the Schwinger effect and the entanglement\nentropy which could lead to a method of measuring entanglement entropy in the\nlaboratory.\n  Finally, we study the \"new massive gravity\" theory and the different black\nhole solutions it admits. We first present three different methods of\ncalculating the conserved charges. Then, by calculating the on-shell Gibbs free\nenergy we construct the Hawking-Page phase diagrams for different solutions in\ntwo thermodynamical ensembles. As the massive gravity models are dual to\ndissipating systems, studying the Hawking-Page diagrams could point out to\ninteresting results for the confinement-deconfinement phase transitions of the\ndual boundary theories.\n", "  The demonstration of efficient single-mode fiber (SMF) coupling is a key\nrequirement for the development of a compact, ultra-precise radial velocity\n(RV) spectrograph. iLocater is a next generation instrument for the Large\nBinocular Telescope (LBT) that uses adaptive optics (AO) to inject starlight\ninto a SMF. In preparation for commissioning iLocater, a prototype SMF\ninjection system was installed and tested at the LBT in the Y-band (0.970-1.065\n$\\mu$m). This system was designed to verify the capability of the LBT AO system\nas well as characterize on-sky SMF coupling efficiencies. SMF coupling was\nmeasured on stars with variable airmasses, apparent magnitudes, and seeing\nconditions for six half-nights using the Large Binocular Telescope\nInterferometer. We present the overall optical and mechanical performance of\nthe SMF injection system, including details of the installation and alignment\nprocedure. A particular emphasis is placed on analyzing the instrument's\nperformance as a function of telescope elevation to inform the final design of\nthe fiber injection system for iLocater.\n", "  The current generation of precision radial velocity (RV) spectrographs are\nseeing-limited instruments. In order to achieve high spectral resolution on 8m\nclass telescopes, these spectrographs require large optics and in turn, large\ninstrument volumes. Achieving milli-Kelvin thermal stability for these systems\nis challenging but is vital in order to obtain a single measurement RV\nprecision of better than 1m/s. This precision is crucial to study Earth-like\nexoplanets within the habitable zone. iLocater is a next generation RV\ninstrument being developed for the Large Binocular Telescope. Unlike\nseeing-limited RV instruments, iLocater uses adaptive optics (AO) to inject a\ndiffraction-limited beam into single-mode fibers. These fibers illuminate the\ninstrument spectrograph, facilitating a diffraction-limited design and a small\ninstrument volume compared to present-day instruments. This enables intrinsic\ninstrument stability and facilitates precision thermal control. We present the\ncurrent design of the iLocater cryostat which houses the instrument\nspectrograph and the strategy for its thermal control. The spectrograph is\nsituated within a pair of radiation shields mounted inside an MLI lined vacuum\nchamber. The outer radiation shield is actively controlled to maintain\ninstrument stability at the sub-mK level and minimize effects of thermal\nchanges from the external environment. An inner shield passively dampens any\nresidual temperature fluctuations and is radiatively coupled to the optical\nboard. To provide intrinsic stability, the optical board and optic mounts will\nbe made from Invar and cooled to 58K to benefit from a zero coefficient of\nthermal expansion (CTE) value at this temperature. Combined, the small\nfootprint of the instrument spectrograph, the use of Invar, and precision\nthermal control will allow long-term sub-milliKelvin stability to facilitate\nprecision RV measurements.\n", "  We are developing a stable and precise spectrograph for the Large Binocular\nTelescope (LBT) named \"iLocater.\" The instrument comprises three principal\ncomponents: a cross-dispersed echelle spectrograph that operates in the\nYJ-bands (0.97-1.30 microns), a fiber-injection acquisition camera system, and\na wavelength calibration unit. iLocater will deliver high spectral resolution\n(R~150,000-240,000) measurements that permit novel studies of stellar and\nsubstellar objects in the solar neighborhood including extrasolar planets.\nUnlike previous planet-finding instruments, which are seeing-limited, iLocater\noperates at the diffraction limit and uses single mode fibers to eliminate the\neffects of modal noise entirely. By receiving starlight from two 8.4m diameter\ntelescopes that each use \"extreme\" adaptive optics (AO), iLocater shows promise\nto overcome the limitations that prevent existing instruments from generating\nsub-meter-per-second radial velocity (RV) precision. Although optimized for the\ncharacterization of low-mass planets using the Doppler technique, iLocater will\nalso advance areas of research that involve crowded fields, line-blanketing,\nand weak absorption lines.\n", "  The problem of formulating synchronous variational principles in the context\nof General Relativity is discussed. Based on the analogy with classical\nrelativistic particle dynamics, the existence of variational principles is\npointed out in relativistic classical field theory which are either\nasynchronous or synchronous. The historical Einstein-Hilbert and Palatini\nvariational formulations are found to belong to the first category.\nNevertheless, it is shown that an alternative route exists which permits one to\ncast these principles in terms of equivalent synchronous Lagrangian variational\nformulations. The advantage is twofold. First, synchronous approaches allow one\nto overcome the lack of gauge symmetry of the asynchronous principles. Second,\nthe property of manifest covariance of the theory is also restored at all\nlevels, including the symbolic Euler-Lagrange equations, with the variational\nLagrangian density being now identified with a $4-$scalar. As an application, a\njoint synchronous variational principle holding both for the non-vacuum\nEinstein and Maxwell equations is displayed, with the matter source being\ndescribed by means of a Vlasov kinetic treatment.\n", "  The problem of formulating a manifest covariant Hamiltonian theory of General\nRelativity in the presence of source fields is addressed, by extending the\nso-called \"DeDonder-Weyl\" formalism to the treatment of classical fields in\ncurved space-time. The theory is based on a synchronous variational principle\nfor the Einstein equation, formulated in terms of superabundant variables. The\ntechnique permits one to determine the continuum covariant Hamiltonian\nstructure associated with the Einstein equation. The corresponding continuum\nPoisson bracket representation is also determined. The theory relies on\nfirst-principles, in the sense that the conclusions are reached in the\nframework of a non-perturbative covariant approach, which allows one to\npreserve both the 4-scalar nature of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian densities as\nwell as the gauge invariance property of the theory.\n", "  We report the discovery that the known `changing look' AGN Mrk 1018 has\nchanged spectral type for a second time. New VLT-MUSE data taken in 2015 as\npart of the Close AGN Reference Survey (CARS) shows that the AGN has returned\nto its original Seyfert 1.9 classification. The CARS sample is selected to\ncontain only bright type 1 AGN, but Mrk 1018's broad emission lines and\ncontinuum, typical of type 1 AGN, have almost entirely disappeared. We use\nspectral fitting of the MUSE spectrum and previously available spectra to\ndetermine the drop in broad line flux and the Balmer decrement. We find that\nthe broad line flux has decreased by a factor of 4.75+/- 0.5 in H{\\alpha} since\nan SDSS spectrum was taken in 2000. The Balmer decrement has not changed\nsignificantly implying no enhanced reddening with time, but the remaining broad\nlines are more asymmetric than those present in the type 1 phase. We posit that\nthe change is due to an intrinsic drop in flux from the accretion disk rather\nthan variable extinction or a tidal disruption event.\n", "  We recently discovered that the active galactic nucleus (AGN) of Mrk 1018 has\nchanged optical type again after 30 years as a type 1 AGN. Here we combine\nChandra, NuStar, Swift, Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based observations to\nexplore the cause of this change. The 2-10keV flux declines by a factor of ~8\nbetween 2010 and 2016. We show with our X-ray observation that this is not\ncaused by varying neutral hydrogen absorption along the line-of-sight up to the\nCompton-thick level. The optical-UV spectral energy distributions are well fit\nwith a standard geometrically thin optically thick accretion disc model that\nseems to obey the expected $L\\sim T^4$ relation. It confirms that a decline in\naccretion disc luminosity is the primary origin for the type change. We detect\na new narrow-line absorber in Lya blue-shifted by ~700km/s with respect to the\nsystemic velocity of the galaxy. This new Lya absorber could be evidence for\nthe onset of an outflow or a companion black hole with associated gas that\ncould be related to the accretion rate change. However, the low column density\nof the absorber means that it is not the direct cause for Mrk 1018's\nchanging-look nature.\n", "  In this paper, the theory of harmonic maps is extended. The soliton or\ntraveling wave solutions of Euler's equations of the extended harmonic maps are\nstudied. In certain cases, the chaotic behaviors of these partial equations can\nbe found for the particular case of the metrics and the potential functions of\nthe extended harmonic equations.\n", "  We have investigated the temperature dependence of the photoluminescence\nspectra and average photoluminescence decay rate of CdTe quantum dot monolayers\nof different sizes as a function of concentration in the range 77 K to 296 K.\nIt is shown that a simple three level analytic model involving bright and dark\nexciton states can only describe the lower temperature data but is unable to\nsatisfactorily fit the data over the full temperature range. An extended model\nwhich includes external trap states is necessary to fit the data above\napproximately 150 K. Parameters for the model are obtained using both temporal\nand spectral data. The model indicates that the efficiency of interaction with\ntrap states increases as the QD monolayer concentration increases, which is\nlikely due to an increase in the density of available traps.\n", "  Abundance of charm data in the current and future low energy flavor\nexperiments makes it possible to study rare decays of D-mesons with ever\nincreased precision. I discuss theoretical implications of derived constraints\non New Physics models from these transitions. I argue that those constraints\ncould be competitive with results of direct searches for New Physics particles\n(including Dark Matter) at the Large Hadron Collider.\n", "  Superstring theories are the most promising theories for unified description\nof all fundamental interactions including gravity. However, these theories are\nformulated consistently only in 10 spacetime dimensions. Therefore, to connect\nto the observable world, it is required to compactify 6 out of those 10\ndimensions in a suitable fashion.\n  In this thesis, we mainly consider compactifications of type II string\ntheories on Calabi-Yau threefolds. As a consequence, the resulting four\ndimensional theories preserve $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry. In these cases the\nmetrics on the moduli spaces of the matter multiplets, vector and\nhypermultiplets, completely determine the low energy theories. Whereas the\nformer are very well understood by now, the complete description of\nhypermultiplets is more complicated. In fact, hypermultiplets receive both\nperturbative and non-perturbative corrections. The thesis mainly pertains to\nthe understanding of the non-perturbative corrections. Our findings for the\nhypermultiplets rely on the so called twistorial construction. We discuss this\ntechnique in details and use it throughout the course of this thesis. In\nparticular, armed with this, and exploiting various symmetries, especially\nS-duality and mirror symmetry, we discuss the procedure to derive the D-brane\nand NS5-brane instanton corrections to the hypermultiplet moduli space.\n", "  Planning high-energy collision experiments for the next few decades requires\nextensive Monte Carlo simulations in order to accomplish physics goals of these\nexperiments. Such simulations are essential for understanding fundamental\nphysics processes, as well as for setting up the detector parameters that help\nestablish R&D projects required over the next few decades. This paper describes\na public repository with Monte Carlo event samples before and after\ndetector-response simulation. The goal of this repository is to facilitate the\naccomplishment of many goals in planning a next generation of particle\nexperiments.\n", "  Static properties of hadrons such as their radii and other moments of the\nelectric and magnetic distributions can only be extracted using theoretical\nmethods and not directly measured from experiments. As a result, discrepancies\nbetween the extracted values from different precision measurements can exist.\nThe proton charge radius, $r_p$, which is either extracted from electron proton\nelastic scattering data or from hydrogen atom spectroscopy seems to be no\nexception. The value $r_p = 0.84087(39)$ fm extracted from muonic hydrogen\nspectroscopy is about 4% smaller than that obtained from electron proton\nscattering or standard hydrogen spectroscopy. The resolution of this so called\nproton radius puzzle has been attempted in many different ways over the past\nsix years. The present article reviews these attempts with a focus on the\nmethods of extracting the radius.\n", "  Molecular crystals often exist in multiple competing polymorphs, showing\nsignificantly different physico-chemical properties. Computational crystal\nstructure prediction is key to interpret and guide the search for the most\nstable or useful form: A real challenge due to the combinatorial search space,\nand the complex interplay of subtle effects that work together to determine the\nrelative stability of different structures. Here we take a comprehensive\napproach based on different flavors of thermodynamic integration in order to\nestimate all contributions to the free energies of these systems with\ndensity-functional theory, including the oft-neglected anharmonic contributions\nand nuclear quantum effects. We take the two main stable forms of paracetamol\nas a paradigmatic example. We find that anharmonic contributions, different\ndescriptions of van der Waals interactions, and nuclear quantum effects all\nmatter to quantitatively determine the stability of different phases. Our\nanalysis highlights the many challenges inherent in the development of a\nquantitative and predictive framework to model molecular crystals. However, it\nalso indicates which of the components of the free energy can benefit from a\ncancellation of errors that can redeem the predictive power of approximate\nmodels, and suggests simple steps that could be taken to improve the\nreliability of ab initio crystal structure prediction.\n", "  We carry out microphotoluminescence measurements of an acceptor-bound exciton\n(A^0X) recombination in the applied magnetic field with a single impurity\nresolution. In order to describe the obtained spectra we develop a theoretical\nmodel taking into account a quantum well (QW) confinement, an electron-hole and\nhole-hole exchange interaction. By means of fitting the measured data with the\nmodel we are able to study the fine structure of individual acceptors inside\nthe QW. The good agreement between our experiments and the model indicates that\nwe observe single acceptors in a pure two-dimensional environment whose states\nare unstrained in the QW plain.\n", "  The double perovskite Y_2NiMnO_6 displays ferromagnetic transition at Tc = 81\nK. The ferromagnetic order at low temperature is confirmed by the saturation\nvalue of magnetization (M_s) and also, validated by the refined ordered\nmagnetic moment values extracted from neutron powder diffraction data at 10 K.\nThis way, the dominant Mn4+ and Ni2+ cationic ordering is confirmed. The\ncation-ordered P 21/n nuclear structure is revealed by neutron powder\ndiffraction studies at 300 and 10 K. Analysis of frequency dependent dielectric\nconstant and equivalent circuit analysis of impedance data takes into account\nthe bulk contribution to total dielectric constant. This reveals an anomaly\nwhich coincides with the ferromagnetic transition temperature (T_c).\nPyrocurrent measurements register a current flow with onset near Tc and a peak\nat 57 K that shifts with temperature ramp rate. The extrinsic nature of the\nobserved pyrocurrent is established by employing a special protocol\nmeasurement. It is realized that the origin is due to re-orientation of\nelectric dipoles created by the free charge carriers and not by spontaneous\nelectric polarization at variance with recently reported magnetism-driven\nferroelectricity in this material\n", "  Advances in nanotechnology lead to an increasing interest in how\nnanoparticles interact with biomembranes. Nanoparticles are wrapped\nspontaneously by biomembranes if the adhesive interactions between the\nparticles and membranes compensate for the cost of membrane bending. In the\nlast years, the cooperative wrapping of spherical nanoparticles in membrane\ntubules has been observed in experiments and simulations. For spherical\nnanoparticles, the stability of the particle-filled membrane tubules strongly\ndepends on the range of the adhesive particle-membrane interactions. In this\narticle, we show via modeling and energy minimization that elongated and patchy\nparticles are wrapped cooperatively in membrane tubules that are highly stable\nfor all ranges of the particle-membrane interactions, compared to individual\nwrapping of the particles. The cooperative wrapping of linear chains of\nelongated or patchy particles in membrane tubules may thus provide an efficient\nroute to induce membrane tubulation, or to store such particles in membranes.\n", "  We report on the first antenna-enhanced optoelectronic microscopy studies on\nnanoscale devices. By coupling the emission and excitation to a scanning\noptical antenna, we are able to locally enhance the electroluminescence and\nphotocurrent along a carbon nanotube device. We show that the emission source\nof the electroluminescence can be point-like with a spatial extension below 20\nnm. Topographic and antenna-enhanced photocurrent measurements reveal that the\nemission takes place at the location of highest local electric field indicating\nthat the mechanism behind the emission is the radiative decay of excitons\ncreated via impact excitation.\n", "  We report a 1 kHz repetition-rate mid-IR (MIR) optical parametric amplifier\n(OPA) system operating at a central wavelength of 5.2 $\\mu$m with the\ntail-to-tail spectrum extending over 1.5 $\\mu$m and delivering 40 $\\mu$J pulses\nthat are compressed to 99 fs (5.6 optical cycles). Also we develop a novel\npulse compression scheme for further pulse compression and wavelength\ntunability. As the first application of this laser system, we generated high\nharmonics in bulk ZnSe above the bandgap, dense exciton generation after\n10-photon absorption, high order sum- and difference-frequency generation,\nultrafast transition in the conduction band, which reflects the structure of\nconduction bands.\n", "  Random motions on the line and on the plane with space-varying velocities are\nconsidered and analyzed in this paper.\n  On the line we investigate symmetric and asymmetric telegraph processes with\nspace-dependent velocities and we are able to present the explicit distribution\nof the position $\\mathcal{T}(t)$, $t>0$, of the moving particle.\n  Also the case of a non-homogeneous Poisson process (with rate $\\lambda =\n\\lambda(t)$) governing the changes of direction is analyzed in three specific\ncases. For the special case $\\lambda(t)= \\alpha/t$ we obtain a random motion\nrelated to the Euler-Poisson-Darboux (EPD) equation which generalizes the\nwell-known case treated e.g. in Foong and Van Kolck (1992), Garra and Orsingher\n(2016) and Rosencrans (1973).\n  A EPD--type fractional equation is also considered and a parabolic solution\n(which in dimension $d=1$ has the structure of a probability density) is\nobtained.\n  Planar random motions with space--varying velocities and infinite directions\nare finally analyzed in Section 5. We are able to present their explicit\ndistributions and for polynomial-type velocity structures we obtain the hyper\nand hypo-elliptic form of their support (of which we provide a picture).\n", "  We review an on-chip approach for spontaneous Raman spectroscopy and Surface\nEnhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) based on evanescent excitation of the\nanalyte as well as evanescent collection of the Raman signal using\nComplementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) compatible single mode\nwaveguides. The signal is either directly collected from the analyte molecules\nor via plasmonic nanoantennas integrated on top of the waveguides. Flexibility\nin the design of the geometry of the waveguide, and/or the geometry of the\nantennas, enables optimization of the collection efficiency. Furthermore the\nsensor can be integrated with additional functionality (sources, detectors,\nspectrometers) on the same chip. In this paper, the basic theoretical concepts\nare introduced to identify the key design parameters and some proof-of-concept\nexperimental results are reviewed.\n", "  Time-dependent injection can cause non-linear cooling effects, which lead to\na faster energy loss of the electrons in jets. The most obvious result is the\nappearance of unique breaks in the SED, which would normally be attributed to a\ncomplicated electron distribution. The knowledge of the observation time and\nduration is important to interpret the observed spectra, because of the\nnon-trivial evolution of the SED. Intrinsic gamma-gamma absorption processes in\nthe emission region are only of minor importance.\n", "  We present an analytical solution for the luminosity distance in spatially\nflat cosmology with pressureless matter and the cosmological constant. The\ncomplex analytical solution is made of a real part and a negligible imaginary\npart. The real part of the luminosity distance allows finding the two\nparameters $H_0$ and $\\om$. A simple expression for the distance modulus for\nSNs of type Ia is reported in the framework of the minimax approximation.\n", "  We harness the momentum of light resonating inside a micro-droplet cavity, to\nexperimentally generate micro-flows within the envelope of the drop. We 3D map\nthese optically induced flows by using fluorescent nanoparticles; which reveals\ncircular micro-streams. The flows are parametrically studied and, as expected,\nexhibit an increase of rotation speed with optical power. The flow is\nnon-circular only when we intentionally break the axial symmetry of the\ndroplet. Besides the fundamental interest in light-flow interactions including\nin opto-fluidic cavities, the optically controlled flows can serve in bringing\nanalytes into the maximum-power region of the microcavity.\n", "  We seek to deepen understanding of the micro-foundations of\ninstitutionalization while contributing to a sociological theory of markets by\ninvestigating the puzzle of price bubbles in financial markets. We find that\nsuch markets, despite textbook conditions of high efficiency -- perfect\ninformation, atomistic agents, no uncertainty -- quickly develop patterns\nconsistent with institutionalization processes.\n", "  The transmission of information can couple two entities of very different\nnature, one of them serving as a memory for the other. Here we study the\nsituation in which information is stored in a wave field and serves as a memory\nthat pilots the dynamics of a particle. Such a system can be implemented by a\nbouncing drop generating surface waves sustained by a parametric forcing. The\nmotion of the resulting \"walker\" when confined in a harmonic potential well is\ngenerally disordered. Here we show that these trajectories correspond to\nchaotic regimes characterized by intermittent transitions between a discrete\nset of states. At any given time, the system is in one of these states\ncharacterized by a double quantization of size and angular momentum. A low\ndimensional intermittency determines their respective probabilities. They thus\nform an eigenstate basis of decomposition for what would be observed as a\nsuperposition of states if all measurements were intrusive.\n", "  This paper deals with the homogenization through $\\Gamma$-convergence of\nweakly coercive integral energies with the oscillating density\n$\\mathbb{L}(x/\\epsilon)\\nabla v : \\nabla v$ in three-dimensional elasticity.\nThe energies are weakly coercive in the sense where the classical functional\ncoercivity satisfied by the periodic tensor L (using smooth test functions v\nwith compact support in $\\mathbb{R}^3$) which reads as $\\Lambda(\\mathbb{L})\n>0$, is replaced by the relaxed condition $\\Lambda(\\mathbb{L}) \\ge 0$.\nSurprisingly, we prove that contrary to the two-dimensional case of [2] which\nseems a priori more constrained, the homogenized tensor $\\mathbb{L}^0$ remains\nstrongly elliptic, or equivalently $\\Lambda(\\mathbb{L}^0) >0$, for any tensor\n$\\mathbb{L} = \\mathbb{L}(y_1)$ satisfying $\\mathbb{L}(y)M : M + D : {\\rm\nCof}(M) \\ge 0$, a.e. $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, $\\forall M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3\\times\n3}$, for some matrix $D \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3\\times3}$ (which implies\n$\\Lambda(\\mathbb{L}) \\ge 0$), and the periodic functional coercivity (using\nsmooth test functions $v$ with periodic gradients) which reads as $\\Lambda_{\\rm\nper}(\\mathbb{L})>0$. Moreover, we derive the loss of strong ellipticity for the\nhomogenized tensor using a rank-two lamination, which justifies by\n$\\Gamma$-convergence the formal procedure of [8].\n", "  Experimental testing on dry woven fabrics exhibits a complex set of evidences\nthat are difficult to be completely described using classical continuum models.\nThe aim of this paper is to show how the introduction of energy terms related\nto the micro-deformation mechanisms of the fabric, in particular to the bending\nstiffness of the yarns, helps in the modeling of the mechanical behavior of\nthis kind of materials. To this aim, a second gradient, hyperelastic, initially\northotropic continuum theory is proposed to model fibrous composite interlocks\nat finite strains. In particular, the present work explores the relationship\nbetween the onset of wrinkling appearing during the simulation of the deep\ndrawing of a woven fabric and the use of a second gradient model. It is shown\nthat the introduction of second gradient terms accounting for the description\nof in-plane and out-of-plane bending rigidities, decreases the onset of\nwrinkles during the simulation of deep-drawing.\n  In this work, a quadratic energy, roughly proportional to the square of the\ncurvature of the fibers, is presented and implemented in the simulations. This\nsimple constitutive assumption allows to clearly show the effects of the second\ngradient energy on both the wrinkling description and the numerical stability\nof the model. The results obtained in second gradient simulations are\ndescriptive of the experimental evidence of deep drawing whose description is\ntargeted in this work. The present paper provides additional evidence of the\nfact that first gradient continuum theories alone cannot be considered fully\ndescriptive of the behavior of dry woven composite reinforcements. On the other\nhand, the proposed second gradient model for fibrous composite reinforcements\nopens the way both to the more accurate simulation of complex forming processes\nand to the possibility of controlling the onset of wrinkles.\n", "  Almost all SETI searches to date have explicitly targeted stars in the hope\nof detecting artificial radio or optical transmissions. It is argued that\nextra-terrestrials (ET) might regard sending physical probes to our own Solar\nSystem as a more efficient means for sending large amounts of information to\nEarth. Probes are more efficient in terms of energy and time expenditures; may\nsolve for the vexing problem of Drake's L factor term, namely, that the\ncivilization wishing to send information may not coexist temporally with the\nintended recipient; and they alleviate ET's reasonable fear that the intended\nrecipient might prove hostile. It is argued that probes may be numerous and\neasier to find than interstellar beacons.\n", "  Culture evolves, not just in the trivial sense that cultures change over\ntime, but also in the strong sense that such change is governed by Darwinian\nprinciples. Both biological and cultural evolution are essentially cumulative\nselection processes in which information (whether genetic or cultural) is\nsieved, retained and then transmitted to the next generation. In both domains\nsuch a process will result in recognizable lineages and tree-like phylogenies\nso characteristic of Darwinian evolution. Because a principle of inheritance\n(i.e., faithful replication of information) holds in both domains, we may trace\nback particular transmission histories and identify the forces that influenced\nthem. The idea that culture evolves is quite old, but only in recent years\nthere has been a serious effort to turn this idea into science. This article\noffers a concise analysis of how a rudimentary idea gradually evolved into a\nthriving research program.\n", "  Reputation systems are currently used, often with success, to ensure the\nfunctioning of online services as well as of e-commerce sites. Despite the\nrelationship between reputation and material cooperative behaviours is quite\nsupported, less obvious appears the relationship with informative behaviours,\nwhich are crucial for the transmission of reputational information and\ntherefore for the maintenance of cooperation among individuals. The purpose of\nthis study was to verify how reputation affects cooperation dynamics in virtual\nenvironment, within a social dilemma situation (i.e., where there are\nincentives to act selfishly). The results confirm that reputation can activate\nprosocial conducts, however it highlights also the limitations and distortions\nthat reputation can create.\n", "  Using the electrostatic approximation, we analyze electromagnetic fields\nscattered by sharp conical metal tips, which are illuminated with light\npolarized along the tip axis. We establish scaling relations for the scattered\nfield amplitude and phase, whose validity is verified with numerical\nsimulations. Analytic expressions for the wavelength, at which the scattered\nfield near the tip changes its direction, and field decay near the tip\nextremity are obtained, relating these characteristics to the cone angle and\nmetal permittivity. The results obtained have important implications to various\ntip-enhanced phenomena, ranging from Raman and scattering near-field imaging to\nphotoemission spectroscopy and nano-optical trapping.\n", "  Motivated by the recent renewed interest in compact analog computing using\nlight and metasurfaces (Silva, A. et al., Science 2014, 343, 160-163), we\nsuggest a practical approach to its realization that involves reflective\nmetasurfaces consisting of arrayed gold nanobricks atop a subwavelength-thin\ndielectric spacer and optically-thick gold film, a configuration that supports\ngap-surface plasmon resonances. Using well established numerical routines, we\ndemonstrate that these metasurfaces enable independent control of the light\nphase and amplitude, and design differentiator and integrator metasurfaces\nfeaturing realistic system parameters. Proof-of-principle experiments are\nreported along with the successful realization of a high-quality poor-man's\nintegrator metasurface operating at the wavelength of 800 nm.\n", "  Cu2-xTe nanocubes were used as starting seeds to access metal telluride\nnanocrystals by cation exchanges at room temperature. The coordination number\nof the entering cations was found to play an important role in dictating the\nreaction pathways. The exchanges with tetrahedrally coordinated cations (i.e.\nwith coordination number 4), such as Cd2+ or Hg2+, yielded monocrystalline CdTe\nor HgTe nanocrystals with Cu2-xTe/CdTe or Cu2-xTe/HgTe Janus-like\nheterostructures as intermediates. The formation of Janus-like architectures\nwas attributed to the high diffusion rate of the relatively small tetrahedrally\ncoordinated cations, which could rapidly diffuse in the Cu2-xTe NCs and\nnucleate the CdTe (or HgTe) phase in a preferred region of the host structure.\nAlso, with both Cd2+ and Hg2+ ions the exchange led to wurtzite CdTe and HgTe\nphases rather than the more stable zinc-blende ones, indicating that the anion\nframework of the starting Cu2- xTe particles could be more easily deformed to\nmatch the anion framework of the metastable wurtzite structures. As hexagonal\nHgTe had never been reported to date, this represents another case of\nmetastable new phases that can only be accessed by cation exchange. On the\nother hand, the exchanges involving octahedrally coordinated ions (i.e. with\ncoordination number 6), such as Pb2+ or Sn2+, yielded rock-salt polycrystalline\nPbTe or SnTe nanocrystals with Cu2-xTe@PbTe or Cu2-xTe@SnTe core@shell\narchitectures at the early stages of the exchange process. In this case, the\noctahedrally coordinated ions are probably too large to diffuse easily through\nthe Cu2-xTe structure: their limited diffusion rate restricts their initial\nreaction to the surface of the nanocrystals, where cation exchange is initiated\nunselectively, leading to core@shell architectures.\n", "  We introduce a numerical framework for calculating decay rate contributions\nwhen excited two-level quantum emitters are located near layered plasmonic\nnanostructures, particularly emphasizing the case of plasmonic nanostructures\natop metal substrates where three decay channels exist: free space radiation,\nOhmic losses, and excitation of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). The\ncalculation of decay rate contributions is based on Huygen's equivalence\nprinciple together with a near-field to far-field transformation of the local\nelectric field, thereby allowing us to discern the part of the electromagnetic\nfield associated with free propagating waves rather than SPPs. The methodology\nis applied to the case of an emitter inside and near a gap-plasmon resonator,\nemphasizing strong position and orientation dependencies of the total decay\nrate, contributions of different decay channels, radiation patterns, and\ndirectivity of SPP excitation.\n", "  In dense and cold regions of the interstellar medium (ISM), molecules may be\nadsorbed onto dust grains to form the ice mantles. Once formed, they can be\nprocessed by ionizing radiation coming from stellar or interstellar medium\nleading to formation of several new molecules in the ice. Among the different\nkind of ionizing radiation, cosmic rays play an important role in the\nsolid-phase chemistry because of the large amount of energy deposited in the\nices. The physicochemical changes induced by the energetic processing of\nastrophysical ices are recorded in a intrinsic parameter of the matter called\ncomplex refractive index (CRI). In this paper, we present for the first time a\ncatalogue containing 39 complex refractive indices (n, k) in the infrared from\n2.0 - 16.6 micrometer for 13 different water-containing ices processed in\nlaboratory by cosmic ray analogs. The calculation was done by using the NKABS\n(acronym of determination of N and K from ABSorbance data) code, which employs\nthe Lambert-Beer and Kramers-Kronig equations to calculate the values of n and\nk. The results are also available at the website:\nhttp://www1.univap.br/gaa/nkabs-database/data.htm. As test case, a\nH2O:NH3:CO2:CH4 ice was employed in a radiative transfer simulation of a\nprototoplanetary disk to show that these data are indispensable to reproduce\nthe spectrum of YSOs containing ices.\n", "  Measuring light's state of polarization is an inherently difficult problem,\nsince the phase information between orthogonal polarization states is typically\nlost in the detection process. In this work, we bring to the fore the\nequivalence between normalized Stokes parameters and diffraction contrasts in\nappropriately designed phase-gradient birefringent metasurfaces and introduce a\nconcept of all-polarization birefringent metagratings. The metagrating, which\nconsists of three interweaved metasurfaces, allows one to easily analyze an\narbitrary state of light polarization by conducting simultaneous (i.e.,\nparallel) measurements of the correspondent diffraction intensities that reveal\nimmediately the Stokes parameters of the polarization state under examination.\nBased on plasmonic metasurfaces operating in reflection at the wavelength of\n800 nm, we design and realize phase-gradient birefringent metasurfaces and the\ncorrespondent metagrating, while experimental characterization of the\nfabricated components convincingly demonstrates the expected functionalities.\nWe foresee the use of the metagrating in compact polarimetric setups at any\nfrequency regime of interest.\n", "  Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamonds are interesting due to their\nremarkable characteristics that are well suited to applications in\nquantum-information processing and magnetic field sensing, as well as\nrepresenting stable fluorescent sources. Multiple NV centers in nanodiamonds\n(NDs) are especially useful as biological fluorophores due to their chemical\nneutrality, brightness and room-temperature photostability. Furthermore, NDs\ncontaining multiple NV centers also have potential in high-precision magnetic\nfield and temperature sensing. Coupling NV centers to propagating surface\nplasmon polariton (SPP) modes gives a base for lab-on-a-chip sensing devices,\nallows enhanced fluorescence emission and collection which can further enhance\nthe precision of NV-based sensors. Here, we investigate coupling of multiple NV\ncenters in individual NDs to the SPP modes supported by silver surfaces\nprotected by thin dielectric layers and by gold V-grooves (VGs) produced via\nthe self-terminated silicon etching. In the first case, we concentrate on\nmonitoring differences in fluorescence spectra obtained from a source ND, which\nis illuminated by a pump laser, and from a scattering ND illuminated only by\nthe fluorescence-excited SPP radiation. In the second case, we observe changes\nin the average NV lifetime when the same ND is characterized outside and inside\na VG. Fluorescence emission from the VG terminations is also observed, which\nconfirms the NV coupling to the VG-supported SPP modes.\n", "  Utilizing the all-sky imaging capabilities of the LWA1 radio telescope along\nwith a host of all-sky optical cameras, we have now observed 44 optical meteor\ncounterparts to radio afterglows. Combining these observations we have\ndetermined the geographic positions of all 44 afterglows. Comparing the number\nof radio detections as a function of altitude above sea level to the number of\nexpected bright meteors we find a strong altitudinal dependence characterized\nby a cutoff below $\\sim$ 90 km, below which no radio emission occurs, despite\nthe fact that many of the observed optical meteors penetrated well below this\naltitude. This cutoff suggests that wave damping from electron collisions is an\nimportant factor for the evolution of radio afterglows, which agrees with the\nhypothesis that the emission is the result of electron plasma wave emission.\n", "  Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are locally excited at silver surfaces\nusing (~100) nm-sized nanodiamonds (NDs) with multiple nitrogen-vacancy (NV)\ncenters (~400). The fluorescence from an externally illuminated (at 532 nm) ND\nand from nearby NDs, which are not illuminated but produce out-of-plane\nscattering of SPPs excited by the illuminated ND, exhibit distinctly different\nwavelength spectra, showing short-wavelength filtering due to the SPP\npropagation loss. The results indicate that NDs with multiple NV centers can be\nused as efficient sub-wavelength SPP sources in planar integrated plasmonics\nfor various applications.\n", "  Newton's potential of a massive homogeneous ellipsoid is derived via\nDirichlet's discontinuous factor. At first we review part of Dirichlet's work\nin an English translation of the original German, and then continue with an\nextension of his method into the complex plane. With this trick it becomes\npossible to first calculate the potential and thereafter the force components\nexerted on a test mass by the ellipsoid. This is remarkable in so far as all\nother famous researchers prior to Dirichlet merely calculated the attraction\ncomponents. Unfortunately, Dirichlet's derivation is to a large extent\nmathematically unacceptable which, however, can be corrected by treating the\nproblem in the complex plane.\n", "  Modeling and simulating overland flow fed by rainfall is a common issue in\nwatershed surface hydrology. Modelers have to choose among various friction\nmodels when defining their simulation framework. The purpose of this work is to\ncompare the simulation quality for the Manning, Darcy-Weisbach, and Poiseuille\nfriction models on the simple case of a constant rain on a thin experimental\nflume. Results show that the usual friction law of Manning is not suitable for\nthis type of flow. The Poiseuille friction model gave the best results both on\nthe flux at the outlet and the velocity and depth profile along the flume. The\nDarcy-Weisbach model shows good results for laminar flow. Additional testing\nshould be carried out for turbulent cases.\n", "  The notion of objective probability or chance, as a physical trait of the\nworld, has proved elusive; the identification of chances with actual\nfrequencies does not succeed. An adequate theory of chance should explain not\nonly the connection of chance with statistics, but with degrees of belief, and\nmore broadly the entire phenomenology of (seemingly) chance events and their\nmeasurement. Branching structure in the decoherence-based many worlds theory\nprovides an account of what chance is that satisfies all these desiderata,\nincluding the requirement that chance involves uncertainty.\n", "  We investigate relaxation dynamics in the system of two identical quantum\ndipole emitters (QDEs) located near a metal nanoparticle (MNP) exhibiting a\ndipolar localized surface plasmon (LSP) resonance at the frequency of the QDE\nradiative transition. Considering one QDE to be brought into an optically\nactive excited state and weakly coupled to the resonant LSP, we show that a\nstable superposition state of two QDEs is formed during the transition time,\nwhich is much shorter than the QDE spontaneous decay time and determined by the\nefficiency of resonant interaction between the QDEs and induced LSP. It is\nelucidated that the superposition state is established as a result of\nredistribution of the energy of the initially excited QDE so that the\ncorresponding steady-state QDE fields induced at the MNP site cancel each\nother. The degree of steady-state entanglement characterized by the concurrence\nis found dependent only on the ratio of distances between the QDEs and the MNP,\nreaching its maximum value of ~ 0.65, when the separation between the MNP and\nthe initially excited QDE is larger by ~ 20% than the distance from the other\nQDE to the MNP.\n", "  The unique optical and electronic properties of graphene allow one to realize\nactive optical devices. While several types of graphene-based photonic\nmodulators have already been demonstrated, the potential of combining the\nversatility of graphene with subwavelength field confinement of\nplasmonic/metallic structures is not fully realized. Here we report fabrication\nand study of hybrid graphene-plasmonic modulators. We consider several types of\nmodulators and identify the most promising one for light modulation at telecom\nand near-infrared. Our proof-of-concept results pave the way towards on-chip\nrealization of efficient graphene-based active plasmonic waveguide devices for\noptical communications.\n", "  Long-term stability of deformable mirrors (DM) is a critical performance\nrequirement for instruments requiring open-loop corrections. The effects of\ntemperature changes in the DM performance are equally critical for such\ninstruments. This paper investigates the long-term stability of three different\nIris AO PTT111 DMs that were calibrated at different times ranging from 13\nmonths to nearly 29 months prior to subsequent testing. Performance testing\nshowed that only a small increase in positioning errors occurred from the\ninitial calibration date to the test dates. The increases in errors ranged from\nas little as 1.38 nm rms after 18 months to 5.68 nm rms after 29 months. The\npaper also studies the effects of small temperature changes, up to 6.2{\\deg}C\naround room temperature. For three different arrays, the errors ranged from\n0.62-1.42 nm rms/{\\deg}C. Removing the effects of packaging shows that errors\nare $\\le$0.50 nm rms/{\\deg}C. Finally, measured data showed that individual\nsegments deformed $\\le$0.11 nm rms/{\\deg}C when heated.\n", "  Highly siderophile elements (HSEs) are strongly depleted in the bulk silicate\nEarth (BSE) but are present in near-chondritic relative abundances. The\nconventional explanation is that the HSEs were stripped from the mantle by the\nsegregation of metal during core formation but were added back in\nnear-chondritic proportions by late accretion, after core formation had ceased.\nHere we show that metal-silicate equilibration and segregation during Earth's\ncore formation actually increased HSE mantle concentrations because HSE\npartition coefficients are relatively low at the high pressures of core\nformation within Earth. The pervasive exsolution and segregation of iron\nsulfide liquid from silicate liquid (the \"Hadean matte\") stripped magma oceans\nof HSEs during cooling and crystallization, before late accretion, and resulted\nin slightly suprachondritic palladium/iridium and ruthenium/iridium ratios.\n", "  We have studied intrinsic defect complexes in In$_2$O$_3$ using ab initio\nrandom structure searching (AIRSS). Our first-principles\ndensity-functional-theory calculations predict the thermodynamic stability of\nseveral novel defect structures. We combine the static lattice energy and\nharmonic vibrational energy with the often-neglected configurational entropy to\nconstruct the free energy, which is minimised to predict defect abundances at\nfinite temperatures. We predict that some of our new defect structures - in\nparticular our {In,2V$_\\mathrm{O}$} and {2In,3V$_\\mathrm{O}$} defects - can\nexist in significant abundances at finite temperatures, and their densities of\nelectronic states indicate that they could play an important role in the\nunexpectedly high density of n-type charge carriers observed in In$_2$O$_3$.\n", "  Bose-Einstein condensation is a unique phase transition in that it is not\ndriven by inter-particle interactions, but can theoretically occur in an ideal\ngas, purely as a consequence of quantum statistics. This chapter addresses the\nquestion \\emph{`How is this ideal Bose gas condensation modified in the\npresence of interactions between the particles?' } This seemingly simple\nquestion turns out to be surprisingly difficult to answer. Here we outline the\ntheoretical background to this question and discuss some recent measurements on\nultracold atomic Bose gases that have sought to provide some answers.\n", "  The paper studies the spatial variation of the magnetization in a\nnonconducting magnetic sample with an excess number of magnons in comparison to\nthe equilibrium. The phenomenon is considered using the Landau-Lifshits\nequation with additional terms describing the longitudinal relaxation of the\nmagnetization, the magnon diffusion and the magnon creation by external\npumping. The free energy of the system is presented in the mean field\napproximation. It is shown that, if the pumping exceeds some critical value,\nregions of the new phase arise where the magnetic moments are oriented opposite\nto the magnetization of the magnetic sample. The phenomenon is similar to the\nappearance of droplets of the condensed phase in the supersaturated vapor. The\nappearance of the new phase either in the form of a single domain or a\nperiodical lattice is demonstrated. The studied process is a competitor to the\nprocess of the Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons.\n", "  The gravitomagnetic field is the force exerted by a moving body on the basis\nof the intriguing interplay between geometry and dynamics which is the analog\nto the magnetic field of a moving charged body in electromagnetism. The\nexistence of such a field has been demonstrated based on special relativity\napproach and also by special relativity plus the gravitational time dilation\nfor two different cases, a moving infinite line and a uniformly moving point\nmass, respectively. We treat these two approaches when the applied cases are\nswitched while appropriate key points are employed. Thus, we demonstrate that\nthe strength of the resulted gravitomagnetic field in the latter approach is\ntwice the former. Then, we also discuss the full linearized general relativity\nand show that it should give the same strength for gravitomagnetic field as the\nlatter approach. Hence, through an exact analogy with the electrodynamic\nequations, we present an argument in order to indicate the best definition\namongst those considered in this issue in the literature. Finally, we\ninvestigate the gravitomagnetic effects and consequences of different\ndefinitions on the geodesic equation including the second order approximation\nterms.\n"]}
