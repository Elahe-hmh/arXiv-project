The obtained results\nagree with, and go further than, most results and estimates, given to date by\nseveral authors, both in mathematical and physical literature.\n", "  We investigate variations of the Zitterbewegung frequency of electron due to\nan external static and uniform magnetic field employing the expectation value\nquantum approach, and compare our results with the classical model of spinning\nparticles. We demonstrate that these two so far compatible approaches are not\nin agreement in the presence of an external uniform static magnetic field, in\nwhich the classical approach breaks the usual symmetry of free particles and\nantiparticles states, i.e. it leads to CP violation. Hence, regarding the\nZitterbewegung frequency of electron, the classical approach in the presence of\nan external magnetic field is unlikely to correctly describe the spin of\nelectron, while the quantum approach does, as expected. We also show that the\nresults obtained via the expectation value are in close agreement with the\nquantum approach of the Heisenberg picture derived in the literature. However,\nthe method we use is capable of being compared with the classical approach\nregarding the spin aspects. The classical interpretation of spin produced by\nthe altered Zitterbewegung frequency, in the presence of an external magnetic\nfield, are discussed.\n", "  We represent an exchange economy in terms of statistical ensembles for\ncomplex networks by introducing the concept of market configuration. This is\ndefined as a sequence of nonnegative discrete random variables $\\{w_{ij}\\}$\ndescribing the flow of a given commodity from agent $i$ to agent $j$. This\nsequence can be arranged in a nonnegative matrix $W$ which we can regard as the\nrepresentation of a weighted and directed network or digraph $G$. Our main\nresult consists in showing that general equilibrium theory imposes highly\nrestrictive conditions upon market configurations, which are in most cases not\nfulfilled by real markets. An explicit example with reference to the e-MID\ninterbank credit market is provided.\n", "  Recent results establish for 2-spin antiferromagnetic systems that the\ncomputational complexity of approximating the partition function on graphs of\nmaximum degree D undergoes a phase transition that coincides with the\nuniqueness phase transition on the infinite D-regular tree. For the\nferromagnetic Potts model we investigate whether analogous hardness results\nhold. Goldberg and Jerrum showed that approximating the partition function of\nthe ferromagnetic Potts model is at least as hard as approximating the number\nof independent sets in bipartite graphs (#BIS-hardness). We improve this\nhardness result by establishing it for bipartite graphs of maximum degree D. We\nfirst present a detailed picture for the phase diagram for the infinite\nD-regular tree, giving a refined picture of its first-order phase transition\nand establishing the critical temperature for the coexistence of the disordered\nand ordered phases. We then prove for all temperatures below this critical\ntemperature that it is #BIS-hard to approximate the partition function on\nbipartite graphs of maximum degree D. As a corollary, it is #BIS-hard to\napproximate the number of k-colorings on bipartite graphs of maximum degree D\nwhen k <= D/(2 ln D).\n  The #BIS-hardness result for the ferromagnetic Potts model uses random\nbipartite regular graphs as a gadget in the reduction. The analysis of these\nrandom graphs relies on recent connections between the maxima of the\nexpectation of their partition function, attractive fixpoints of the associated\ntree recursions, and induced matrix norms. We extend these connections to\nrandom regular graphs for all ferromagnetic models and establish the Bethe\nprediction for every ferromagnetic spin system on random regular graphs. We\nalso prove for the ferromagnetic Potts model that the Swendsen-Wang algorithm\nis torpidly mixing on random D-regular graphs at the critical temperature for\nlarge q.\n", "  Electron and nuclear spins of donor ensembles in isotopically pure silicon\nexperience a vacuum-like environment, giving them extraordinary coherence.\nHowever, in contrast to a real vacuum, electrons in silicon occupy quantum\nsuperpositions of valleys in momentum space. Addressable single-qubit and\ntwo-qubit operations in silicon require that qubits are placed near interfaces,\nmodifying the valley degrees of freedom associated with these quantum\nsuperpositions and strongly influencing qubit relaxation and exchange\nprocesses. Yet to date, spectroscopic measurements only indirectly probe\nwavefunctions, preventing direct experimental access to valley population,\ndonor position, and environment. Here we directly probe the probability density\nof single quantum states of individual subsurface donors, in real space and\nreciprocal space, using scanning tunneling spectroscopy. We directly observe\nquantum mechanical valley interference patterns associated with linear\nsuperpositions of valleys in the donor ground state. The valley population is\nfound to be within $5 \\%$ of a bulk donor when $2.85\\pm0.45$ nm from the\ninterface, indicating that valley perturbation-induced enhancement of spin\nrelaxation will be negligible for depths $>3$ nm. The observed valley\ninterference will render two-qubit exchange gates sensitive to atomic-scale\nvariations in positions of subsurface donors. Moreover, these results will also\nbe of interest to emerging schemes proposing to encode information directly in\nvalley polarization.\n", "  Superconductivity and superfluidity of fermionic and bosonic systems are\nremarkable many-body quantum phenomena. In liquid helium and dilute gases, Bose\nand Fermi superfluidity has been observed separately, but producing a mixture\nin which both the fermionic and the bosonic components are superfluid is\nchallenging. Here we report on the observation of such a mixture with dilute\ngases of two Lithium isotopes, 6Li and 7Li. We probe the collective dynamics of\nthis system by exciting center-of-mass oscillations that exhibit extremely low\ndamping below a certain critical velocity. Using high precision spectroscopy of\nthese modes we observe coherent energy exchange and measure the coupling\nbetween the two superfluids. Our observations can be captured theoretically\nusing a sum-rule approach that we interpret in terms of two coupled\noscillators.\n", "  We discuss the quantization of linearized gravity on globally hyperbolic,\nasymptotically flat, vacuum spacetimes and the construction of distinguished\nstates which are both of Hadamard form and invariant under the action of all\nbulk isometries. The procedure, we follow, consists of looking for a\nrealization of the observables of the theory as a sub-algebra of an auxiliary,\nnon-dynamical algebra constructed on future null infinity $\\Im^+$. The\napplicability of this scheme is tantamount to proving that a solution of the\nequations of motion for linearized gravity can be extended smoothly to $\\Im^+$.\nThis has been claimed to be possible provided that a suitable gauge fixing\ncondition, first written by Geroch and Xanthopoulos, is imposed. We review its\ndefinition critically showing that there exists a previously unnoticed\nobstruction in its implementation leading us to introducing the concept of\nradiative observables. These constitute an algebra for which a Hadamard state\ninduced from null infinity and invariant under the action of all spacetime\nisometries exists and it is explicitly constructed.\n", "  Femtosecond laser exposure in the non-ablative regime induces a variety of\nbulk structural modifications, in which anisotropy may depend on the\npolarization of the writing beam. In this work, we investigate the correlation\nbetween polarization state and stress anisotropy. In particular, we introduce a\nmethodology that allows for rapid analysis and visualization of laser-induced\nstress anisotropy in glasses and crystals. Using radial and azimuthal\npolarization, we also demonstrate stress states that are nearly isotropic.\n", "  We show theoretically that it is possible to create and manipulate a pair of\nbound states in continuum in ultracold atoms by two lasers in the presence of a\nmagnetically tunable Feshbach resonance. These bound states are formed due to\ncoherent superposition of two electronically excited molecular bound states and\na quasi-bound state in ground-state potential. These superposition states are\ndecoupled from the continuum of two-atom collisional states. Hence, in the\nabsence of other damping processes they are non-decaying. We analyze in detail\nthe physical conditions that can lead to the formation of such states in cold\ncollisions between atoms, and discuss the possible experimental signatures of\nsuch states. An extremely narrow and asymmetric shape with a distinct minimum\nof photoassociative absorption spectrum or scattering cross section as a\nfunction of collision energy will indicate the occurrence of a bound state in\ncontinuum (BIC). We prove that the minimum will occur at an energy at which the\nBIC is formed. We discuss how a BIC will be useful for efficient creation of\nFeshbach molecules and manipulation of cold collisions. Experimental\nrealizations of BIC will pave the way for a new kind of bound-bound\nspectroscopy in ultracold atoms.\n", "  We provide a detailed proof of Hawking's singularity theorem in the\nregularity class $C^{1,1}$, i.e., for spacetime metrics possessing locally\nLipschitz continuous first derivatives. The proof uses recent results in\n$C^{1,1}$-causality theory and is based on regularisation techniques adapted to\nthe causal structure.\n", "  We extend the validity of the Penrose singularity theorem to spacetime\nmetrics of regularity $C^{1,1}$. The proof is based on regularisation\ntechniques, combined with recent results in low regularity causality theory.\n", "  Using a second-order perturbative Green's functions approach we determined\nthe normal state single-particle spectral function $A(\\vec{k},\\omega)$\nemploying a minimal effective model for iron-based superconductors. The\nmicroscopic model, used before to study magnetic fluctuations and\nsuperconducting properties, includes the two effective tight-binding bands\nproposed by S.Raghu et al. [Phys. Rev. B 77, 220503 (R) (2008)], and intra- and\ninter-orbital local electronic correlations, related to the Fe-3d orbitals.\nHere, we focus on the study of normal state electronic properties, in\nparticular the temperature and doping dependence of the total density of\nstates, $A(\\omega)$, and of $A(\\vec{k},\\omega)$ in different Brillouin zone\nregions, and compare them to the existing angle resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES) and previous theoretical results in ferropnictides. We\nobtain an asymmetric effect of electron and hole doping, quantitative agreement\nwith the experimental chemical potential shifts as a function of doping, as\nwell as spectral weight redistributions near the Fermi level as a function of\ntemperature consistent with the available experimental data. In addition, we\npredict a non-trivial dependence of the total density of states with the\ntemperature, exhibiting clear renormalization effects by correlations.\nInterestingly, investigating the origin of this predicted behaviour by\nanalyzing the evolution with temperature of the k-dependent self-energy\nobtained in our approach, we could identify a number of specific Brillouin zone\npoints, none of them probed by ARPES experiments yet, where the largest\nnon-trivial effects of temperature on the renormalization are present.\n", "  We introduce NebulOS, a Big Data platform that allows a cluster of Linux\nmachines to be treated as a single computer. With NebulOS, the process of\nwriting a massively parallel program for a datacenter is no more complicated\nthan writing a Python script for a desktop computer. The platform enables most\npre-existing data analysis software to be used, as scale, in a datacenter\nwithout modification. The shallow learning curve and compatibility with\nexisting software greatly reduces the time required to develop distributed data\nanalysis pipelines. The platform is built upon industry-standard, open-source\nBig Data technologies, from which it inherits several fault tolerance features.\nNebulOS enhances these technologies by adding an intuitive user interface,\nautomated task monitoring, and other usability features. We present a summary\nof the architecture, provide usage examples, and discuss the system's\nperformance scaling.\n", "  Based on symmetries Taub-NUT shares with Bertrand spacetime, we cast it as\nthe latter with magnetic fields. Its nature as a Bianchi-IX gravitational\ninstanton and other related geometrical properties are reviewed. We provide an\neasy derivation and comparison between the spatial Killing-Yano tensors deduced\nfrom first-integrals and the corresponding hyperk\\\"ahler structures and finally\nverify the existence of a graded Lie-algebra structure via Schouten-Nijenhuis\nbrackets.\n", "  The aim of this study is to extend the scope and applicability of the\nlevel-crossing method to discrete-time stochastic processes and generalize it\nto enable us to study multiple discrete-time stochastic processes. In previous\nversions of the level-crossing method, problems with it correspond to the fact\nthat this method had been developed for analyzing a continuous-time process or\nat most a multiple continuous-time process in an individual manner. However,\nsince all empirical processes are discrete in time, the already-established\nlevel-crossing method may not prove adequate for studying empirical processes.\nBeyond this, due to the fact that most empirical processes are coupled; their\nindividual study could lead to vague results. To achieve the objectives of this\nstudy, we first find an analytical expression for the average frequency of\ncrossing a level in a discrete-time process, giving the measure of the time\nexperienced for two consecutive crossings named as the \"waiting time\". We then\nintroduce the generalized level-crossing method by which the consideration of\ncoupling between the components of a multiple process becomes possible.\nFinally, we provide an analytic solution when the components of a multiple\nstochastic process are independent Gaussian white noises. The comparison of the\nresults obtained for coupled and uncoupled processes measures the strength and\nefficiency of the coupling, justifying our model and analysis. The advantage of\nthe proposed method is its sensitivity to the slightest coupling and shortest\ncorrelation length.\n", "  We examine the constraints on the two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) due to the\nstability of the scalar potential and absence of Landau poles at energy scales\nbelow the Planck scale. We employ the most general 2HDM that incorporates an\napproximately Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson with a flavor aligned Yukawa\nsector to eliminate potential tree-level Higgs-mediated flavor changing neutral\ncurrents. Using basis independent techniques, we exhibit robust regimes of the\n2HDM parameter space with a 125 GeV SM-like Higgs boson that is stable and\nperturbative up to the Planck scale. Implications for the heavy scalar spectrum\nare exhibited.\n", "  Robust modelling of strong lensing systems is fundamental to exploit the\ninformation they contain about the distribution of matter in galaxies and\nclusters. In this work, we present Lensed, a new code which performs forward\nparametric modelling of strong lenses. Lensed takes advantage of a massively\nparallel ray-tracing kernel to perform the necessary calculations on a modern\ngraphics processing unit (GPU). This makes the precise rendering of the\nbackground lensed sources much faster, and allows the simultaneous optimisation\nof tens of parameters for the selected model. With a single run, the code is\nable to obtain the full posterior probability distribution for the lens light,\nthe mass distribution and the background source at the same time. Lensed is\nfirst tested on mock images which reproduce realistic space-based observations\nof lensing systems. In this way, we show that it is able to recover unbiased\nestimates of the lens parameters, even when the sources do not follow exactly\nthe assumed model. Then, we apply it to a subsample of the SLACS lenses, in\norder to demonstrate its use on real data. The results generally agree with the\nliterature, and highlight the flexibility and robustness of the algorithm.\n", "  The entangled behavior of different dimensional systems driven by classical\nexternal random field is investigated. The amount of the survival entanglement\nbetween the components of each system is quantified. There are different\nbehaviors of entanglement that come into view decay, sudden death, sudden birth\nand long-lived entanglement. The maximum entangled states which can be\ngenerated from any of theses suggested systems are much fragile than the\npartially entangled ones. The systems of larger dimensions are more robust than\nthose of smaller dimensions systems, where the entanglement decay smoothly,\ngradually and may vanish for a very short time. For the class of $2\\times 3$\ndimensional system, the one parameter family is found to be more robust than\nthe two parameters family. Although the entanglement of driven $ 2 \\times 3$\ndimensional system is very sensitive to the classical external random field,\none can use them to generate a long-lived entanglement.\n", "  We model a dye-doped polymeric nanosphere as an ensemble of quantum emitters\nand use it to investigate the localized exciton-polaritons supported by such a\nnanosphere. By determining the time evolution of the density matrix of the\ncollective system, we explore how an incident laser field may cause transient\noptical field enhancement close to the surface of such nanoparticles. Our\nresults provide further evidence that excitonic materials can be used to good\neffect in nanophotonics.\n", "  We report on the connections between noncommutative principal circle bundles,\nPimsner algebras and strongly graded algebras. We illustrate several results\nwith the examples of quantum weighted projective and lens spaces and\ntheta-deformations.\n", "  We consider the general spin-1 SU(2) invariant Heisenberg model with a\ntwo-body interaction. A random loop model is introduced and relations to\nquantum spin systems is proved. Using this relation it is shown that for\ndimensions 3 and above N\\'eel order occurs for a large range of values of the\nrelative strength of the bilinear ($-J_1$) and biquadratic ($-J_2$) interaction\nterms. The proof uses the method of reflection positivity and infrared bounds.\nLinks between spin correlations and loop correlations are proved.\n", "  Laser photons carrying non-zero orbital angular momentum are known and\nexploited during the last twenty years. Recently it has been demonstrated\nexperimentally that such (twisted) electrons can be produced and even focused\nto a subnanometer scale. Thus, twisted electrons emerge as a new tool in atomic\nphysics. The state of a twisted electron can be considered as a specific wave\npacket of plane waves. In the present paper-I we consider elastic scattering of\nthe wave packets of fast non-relativistic particles on a potential field. We\nobtain simple and convenient formulae for a number of events in such a\nscattering. The equations derived represent, in fact, generalization of the\nwell-known Born approximation for the case when finite sizes and inhomogeneity\nof the initial packet should be taken into account. To illustrate the obtained\nresults, we consider two simple models corresponding to scattering of a\nGaussian wave packet on the Gaussian potential and on the hydrogen atom. The\nscattering of twisted electrons on atoms will be considered in the next\npaper-II.\n", "  We obtain an explicit solution for the stationary state populations of a\ndissipative Fano model, where a discrete excited state is coupled to a\ncontinumm set of states; both excited set of states are reachable by\nphoto-excitation from the ground state. The dissipative dynamic is described by\na Liouville equation in Lindblad form and the field intensity can take\narbitrary values within the model. We show that the continuum states population\nas a function of laser frequency can always be expressed as a Fano profile plus\na Lorentzian function with effective parameters whose explicit expressions are\ngiven in the case of a closed system coupled to a bath as well as for the\noriginal Fano scattering framework. Although the solution is intricate, it can\nbe elegantly expressed as a linear transformation of the kernel of a $4\\times\n4$ matrix which has the meaning of an effective Liouvillian. We unveil key\nnotable processes related to the optical nonlinearity and which had not been\nreported to date: electromagnetic induced-transparency, population inversions,\npower narrowing and broadening, as well as an effective reduction of the Fano\nasymmetry parameter.\n", "  We introduce a method for evaluating integrals in geometric calculus without\nintroducing coordinates, based on using the fundamental theorem of calculus\nrepeatedly and cutting the resulting manifolds so as to create a boundary and\nallow for the existence of an antiderivative at each step. The method is a\ndirect generalization of the usual method of integration on function of a real\nvariable. It may lead to both practical applications and help unveil new\nconnections to various fields of mathematics.\n", "  In this work we explicitly solve the problem of the harmonic oscillator in\nthe classical limit of a minimal-length scenario. We show that (i) the motion\nequation of the oscillator is not linear anymore because the presence of a\nminimal length introduces an anarmonic term and (ii) its motion is described by\na Jacobi sine elliptic function. Therefore the motion is periodic with the same\namplitude and with the new period depending on the minimal length. This result\n(the change in the period of oscillation) is very important since it enables us\nto find in a quite simple way the most relevant effect of the presence of a\nminimal length and consequently traces of the Planck-scale physics. We show\napplications of our results in spectroscopy and gravity.\n", "  We consider a superconductor proximity coupled to a two-dimensional\nferromagnetic film with a skyrmion texture. Using the T-matrix calculations and\nnumerical modeling we calculate the spin-polarized local density of states in\nthe superconductor in the vicinity of the skyrmion. We predict the skyrmion\nbound states (SBS) that are induced in the superconductor, similar to the\nwell-known Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states. The SBS wavefunctions have spatial\npower law decay. Presence of the SBS suggests the mechanism by which\nsuperconductivity could facilitate an effective long-range interaction between\nskyrmions when their SBS wavefunctions overlap.\n", "  The electronic properties of the wormhole and the perturbed nanocylinder will\nbe investigated using two different methods: the continuum gauge field-theory\nmodel which deals with the contin- uum approximation of the surface and the\nHaydock recursion method which transforms the surface into simplier structure\nand deals with the nearest-neighbor interactions. Furthermore, the changes of\nthe electronic properties will be investigated for the case of enclosing the\nappropriate structure and possible substitutes for the encloser will be\nderived. Finally, possible character of the electron flux will be derived from\nthe model based on the multiwalled nanotubes.\n", "  Large collections of autonomously moving agents, such as animals or\nmicro-organisms, are able to 'flock' coherently in space even in the absence of\na central control mechanism. While the direction of the flock resulting from\nthis critical behavior is random, this can be controlled by a small subset of\ninformed individuals acting as leaders of the group. In this article we use the\nVicsek model to investigate how flocks respond to leadership and make\ndecisions. Using a combination of numerical simulations and continuous modeling\nwe demonstrate that flocks display a linear response to leadership that can be\ncast in the framework of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, identifying an\n'effective temperature' reflecting how promptly the flock reacts to the\ninitiative of the leaders. The linear response to leadership also holds in the\npresence of two groups of informed individuals with competing interests,\nindicating that the flock's behavioral decision is determined by both the\nnumber of leaders and their degree of influence.\n", "  Starting with the general principles of global and local symmetries, the\neffective pion-nucleon lagrangian, essentially non-linear in pion field, to\ndescribe the non-strange hadrons low-energy electro-weak transitions is\ndeveloped. We encounter no divergence summarizing properly all the infinite\npower series in pion field which occur in the course of treatment. Our\nconsistent approach proves to be relevant in considering P-parity violation in\npion-nucleon interactions.\n", "  Mapping the strong interaction between Rydberg atoms onto single photons via\nelectromagnetically induced transparency enables manipulation of light on the\nsingle photon level and novel few-photon devices such as all-optical switches\nand transistors operated by individual photons. Here, we demonstrate\nexperimentally that Stark-tuned F\\\"orster resonances can substantially increase\nthis effective interaction between individual photons. This technique boosts\nthe gain of a single-photon transistor to over 100, enhances the\nnon-destructive detection of single Rydberg atoms to a fidelity beyond 0.8, and\nenables high precision spectroscopy on Rydberg pair states. On top, we achieve\na gain larger than 2 with gate photon read-out after the transistor operation.\nTheory models for Rydberg polariton propagation on F\\\"orster resonance and for\nthe projection of the stored spin-wave yield excellent agreement to our data\nand successfully identify the main decoherence mechanism of the Rydberg\ntransistor, paving the way towards photonic quantum gates.\n", "  A good description of the electronic structure of BiS$_{2}$-based\nsuperconductors is essential to understand their phase diagram, normal state\nand superconducting properties. To describe the first reports of normal state\nelectronic structure features from angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) in LaO$_{1-x}$F$_{x}$BiS$_{2}$, we used a minimal microscopic model to\nstudy their low energy properties. It includes the two effective tight-binding\nbands proposed by Usui et al [Phys.Rev.B 86, 220501(R)(2012)], and we added\nmoderate intra- and inter-orbital electron correlations related to Bi-($p_{Y}$,\n$p_{X}$) and S-($p_{Y}$, $p_{X}$) orbitals. We calculated the electron Green's\nfunctions using their equations of motion, which we decoupled in second-order\nof perturbations on the correlations. We determined the normal state spectral\ndensity function and total density of states for LaO$_{1-x}$F$_{x}$BiS$_{2}$,\nfocusing on the description of the k-dependence, effect of doping, and the\nprediction of the temperature dependence of spectral properties. Including\nmoderate electron correlations, improves the description of the few\nexperimental ARPES and soft X-ray photoemission data available for\nLaO$_{1-x}$F$_{x}$BiS$_{2}$. Our analytical approximation enabled us to\ncalculate the spectral density around the conduction band minimum at\n$\\vec{k}_{0}=(0.45\\pi,0.45\\pi)$, and to predict the temperature dependence of\nthe spectral properties at different BZ points, which might be verified by\ntemperature dependent ARPES.\n", "  We present a hard X-ray NuSTAR observation of PSR J0437-4715, the nearest\nmillisecond pulsar. The known pulsations at the apparent pulse period ~5.76 ms\nare detected at energies up to 20 keV. We measure a photon index $\\Gamma=\n1.65\\pm0.24$ (90% confidence) for the power law fit to the non-thermal\nemission. It had been shown that spectral models with two or three thermal\ncomponents fit the XMM-Newton spectrum of PSR J0437-4715, depending on the\nslope of the power-law component, and the amount of absorption of soft X-rays.\nThe new constraint on the high-energy emission provided by NuSTAR removes\nambiguities regarding the thermal components of the emission below 3 keV. We\nperformed a simultaneous spectral analysis of the XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data to\nconfirm that three thermal components and a power law are required to fit the\n0.3-20 keV emission of PSR J0437-4715. Adding a ROSAT-PSPC spectrum further\nconfirmed this result and allowed us to better constrain the temperatures of\nthe three thermal components. A phase-resolved analysis of the NuSTAR data\nrevealed no significant change in the photon index of the high-energy emission.\nThis NuSTAR observation provides further impetus for future observations with\nthe NICER mission (Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer) whose\nsensitivity will provide much stricter constraints on the equation of state of\nnuclear matter by combining model fits to the pulsar's phase-folded lightcurve\nwith the pulsar's well-defined mass and distance from radio timing\nobservations.\n", "  The transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) $1T$-TaS$_{2}$ exhibits a rich set\nof charge density wave (CDW) orders. Recent investigations suggested that using\nlight or electric field can manipulate the commensurate (C) CDW ground state.\nSuch manipulations are considered to be determined by the charge carrier\ndoping. Here we simulate by first-principles calculations the carrier doping\neffect on CCDW in $1T$-TaS$_{2}$. We investigate the charge doping effects on\nthe electronic structures and phonon instabilities of $1T$ structure and\nanalyze the doping induced energy and distortion ratio variations in CCDW\nstructure. We found that both in bulk and monolayer $1T$-TaS$_{2}$, CCDW is\nstable upon electron doping, while hole doping can significantly suppress the\nCCDW, implying different mechanisms of such reported manipulations. Light or\npositive perpendicular electric field induced hole doping increases the energy\nof CCDW, so that the system transforms to NCCDW or similar metastable state. On\nthe other hand, even the CCDW distortion is more stable upon in-plain electric\nfield induced electron injection, some accompanied effects can drive the system\nto cross over the energy barrier from CCDW to nearly commensurate (NC) CDW or\nsimilar metastable state. We also estimate that hole doping can introduce\npotential superconductivity with $T_{c}$ of $6\\sim7$ K. Controllable switching\nof different states such as CCDW/Mott insulating state, metallic state, and\neven the superconducting state can be realized in $1T$-TaS$_{2}$, which makes\nthe novel material have very promising applications in the future electronic\ndevices.\n", "  Motivated by the recently reported diphoton resonance at 750 GeV, we study a\nnew axion-like bosonic portal model of dark matter physics. When the resonance\nparticle is identified as the pseudo-scalar mediator, via which the standard\nmodel sector would interact with the dark matter sector, the data from collider\nphysics would provide profound implications to dark matter phenomenology. In\nthis paper, we first identify the preferred parameter space of the suggested\nportal model from the results of the LHC run with $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV, and then\nwe examine the dark matter signature taking into account the data from\ncosmic-ray experiments including Fermi-LAT dwarf galaxy $\\gamma$-ray search,\nHESS $\\gamma$-line search, and future CTA diffuse $\\gamma$-ray and\n$\\gamma$-line searches.\n", "  Improved understanding of runaway-electron formation and decay processes are\nof prime interest for the safe operation of large tokamaks, and the dynamics of\nthe runaway electrons during dynamical scenarios such as disruptions are of\nparticular concern. In this paper, we present kinetic modelling of scenarios\nwith time-dependent plasma parameters; in particular, we investigate hot-tail\nrunaway generation during a rapid drop in plasma temperature. With the goal of\nstudying runaway-electron generation with a self-consistent electric-field\nevolution, we also discuss the implementation of a collision operator that\nconserves momentum and energy and demonstrate its properties. An operator for\navalanche runaway-electron generation, which takes the energy dependence of the\nscattering cross section and the runaway distribution into account, is\ninvestigated. We show that the simplified avalanche model of Rosenbluth &\nPutvinskii [Nucl. Fusion 1997 37 1355] can give inaccurate results for the\navalanche growth rate (either lower or higher) for many parameters, especially\nwhen the average runaway energy is modest, such as during the initial phase of\nthe avalanche multiplication. The developments presented pave the way for\nimproved modelling of runaway-electron dynamics during disruptions or other\ndynamic events.\n", "  Electromagnetic (EM) waves propagating through an inhomogeneous medium\ninevitably scatter whenever electromagnetic properties of the medium change on\nthe scale of a single wavelength. This fundamental phenomenon constrains how\noptical structures are designed and interfaced with each other. Recent\ntheoretical work indicates that electromagnetic structures collectively known\nas photonic topological insulators (PTIs) can be employed to overcome this\nfundamental limitation, thereby paving the way for ultra-compact photonic\nstructures that no longer have to be wavelength-scale smooth. Here we present\nthe first experimental demonstration of a photonic delay line based on\ntopologically protected surface electromagnetic waves (TPSWs) between two PTIs\nwhich are the EM counterparts of the quantum spin-Hall topological insulators\nin condensed matter. Unlike conventional guided EM waves that do not benefit\nfrom topological protection, TPSWs are shown to experience multi-wavelength\nreflection-free time delays when detoured around sharply-curved paths, thus\noffering a unique paradigm for compact and efficient wave buffers and other\ndevices.\n", "  Let $\\mathcal{P}_{\\beta}^{(V)} (N_{\\cal I})$ be the probability that a\n$N\\times N$ $\\beta$-ensemble of random matrices with confining potential $V(x)$\nhas $N_{\\cal I}$ eigenvalues inside an interval ${\\cal I}=[a,b]$ of the real\nline. We introduce a general formalism, based on the Coulomb gas technique and\nthe resolvent method, to compute analytically $\\mathcal{P}_{\\beta}^{(V)}\n(N_{\\cal I})$ for large $N$. We show that this probability scales for large $N$\nas $\\mathcal{P}_{\\beta}^{(V)} (N_{\\cal I})\\approx \\exp\\left(-\\beta N^2\n\\psi^{(V)}(N_{\\cal I} /N)\\right)$, where $\\beta$ is the Dyson index of the\nensemble. The rate function $\\psi^{(V)}(k_{\\cal I})$, independent of $\\beta$,\nis computed in terms of single integrals that can be easily evaluated\nnumerically. The general formalism is then applied to the classical\n$\\beta$-Gaussian (${\\cal I}=[-L,L]$), $\\beta$-Wishart (${\\cal I}=[1,L]$) and\n$\\beta$-Cauchy (${\\cal I}=[-L,L]$) ensembles. Expanding the rate function\naround its minimum, we find that generically the number variance ${\\rm\nVar}(N_{\\cal I})$ exhibits a non-monotonic behavior as a function of the size\nof the interval, with a maximum that can be precisely characterized. These\nanalytical results, corroborated by numerical simulations, provide the full\ncounting statistics of many systems where random matrix models apply. In\nparticular, we present results for the full counting statistics of zero\ntemperature one-dimensional spinless fermions in a harmonic trap.\n", "  The split property expresses a strong form of independence of spacelike\nseparated regions in algebraic quantum field theory. In Minkowski spacetime, it\ncan be proved under hypotheses of nuclearity. An expository account is given of\nnuclearity and the split property, and connections are drawn to the theory of\nquantum energy inequalities. In addition, a recent proof of the split property\nfor quantum field theory in curved spacetimes is outlined, emphasising the\nessential ideas.\n", "  The coalescences of stellar-mass black-hole binaries through their inspiral,\nmerger, and ringdown are among the most promising sources for ground-based\ngravitational-wave (GW) detectors. If a GW signal is observed with sufficient\nsignal-to-noise ratio, the masses and spins of the black holes can be estimated\nfrom just the inspiral part of the signal. Using these estimates of the initial\nparameters of the binary, the mass and spin of the final black hole can be\nuniquely predicted making use of general-relativistic numerical simulations. In\naddition, the mass and spin of the final black hole can be independently\nestimated from the merger--ringdown part of the signal. If the binary black\nhole dynamics is correctly described by general relativity (GR), these\nindependent estimates have to be consistent with each other. We present a\nBayesian implementation of such a test of general relativity, which allows us\nto combine the constraints from multiple observations. Using kludge modified GR\nwaveforms, we demonstrate that this test can detect sufficiently large\ndeviations from GR, and outline the expected constraints from upcoming GW\nobservations using the second-generation of ground-based GW detectors.\n", "  Results are reported from a search for the top squark, the lighter of the two\nsupersymmetric partners of the top quark. The data sample corresponds to 19.7\ninverse femtobarns of proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV collected\nwith the CMS detector at the LHC. The search targets top squark to b chi+/- and\ntop squark to t(*) chi0 decay modes, where chi+/- and chi0 are the lightest\nchargino and neutralino, respectively. The reconstructed final state consists\nof jets, b jets, missing transverse energy, and either one or two leptons.\nLeading backgrounds are determined from data. No significant excess in data is\nobserved above the expectation from standard model processes. The results\nexclude a region of the two-dimensional plane of possible top squark and chi0\nmasses. The highest excluded top squark and chi0 masses are about 700 GeV and\n250 GeV, respectively.\n", "  The relaxion mechanism is a novel solution to the hierarchy problem. In this\nfirst statistical analysis of the relaxion mechanism, we quantify the relative\nplausibility of a QCD and a non-QCD relaxion model versus the Standard Model\nwith Bayesian statistics, which includes an automatic penalty for fine-tuning.\nWe find that in light of the hierarchy between the weak and Planck scales,\nrelaxion models are favoured by colossal Bayes-factors. Constraints upon \\eg\nthe vacuum energy during relaxation, however, shrink the Bayes-factors such\nthat relaxion models are only slightly favoured. Including the bounds on\n$\\left|\\theta_\\text{QCD}\\right|$ shatters the plausibility of the QCD relaxion\nmodel as it typically yields $\\left|\\theta_\\text{QCD}\\right| \\gg 0$. Finally,\nwe augment our models with scalar-field inflation and consider measurements of\ninflationary observables from BICEP/Planck. We find that, all told, the\nStandard Model is favoured by huge Bayes-factors as the relaxion models require\nfine-tuning such that the Hubble parameter is less than the height of the\nperiodic barriers. Thus, whilst we confirm that relaxion models could solve the\nhierarchy problem, we find that their unconventional cosmology demolishes their\nplausibility.\n", "  We provide the first evidence that the puzzling dielectric Debye process\nobserved in mono-alcohols is coupled to density fluctuations. The results open\nup for an explanation of the Debye process within the framework of conventional\nliquid-state theory. The spectral shape of dynamical bulk modulus of\n2-ethyl-1-hexanol is nearly identical to that of the shear modulus, and thus\nthe supramolecular structures believed to be responsible for the slow\ndielectric Debye process are manifested in the bulk modulus in the same way as\nin the shear modulus.\n", "  A search for singly produced vector-like $Q$ quarks, where $Q$ can be either\na $T$ quark with charge $+2/3$ or a $Y$ quark with charge $-4/3$, is performed\nin proton-proton collisions recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The\ndataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ and was\nproduced with a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV. This analysis\ntargets $Q \\to Wb$ decays where the $W$ boson decays leptonically. A veto on\nmassive large-radius jets is used to reject the dominant $t\\bar{t}$ background.\nThe reconstructed $Q$-candidate mass, ranging from 0.4 to 1.2 TeV, is used in\nthe search to discriminate signal from background processes. No significant\ndeviation from the Standard Model expectation is observed, and limits are set\non the $Q \\to Wb$ cross-section times branching ratio. The results are also\ninterpreted as limits on the $QWb$ coupling and the mixing with the Standard\nModel sector for a singlet $T$ quark or a $Y$ quark from a doublet. $T$ quarks\nwith masses below 0.95 TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level, assuming a\nunit coupling and a BR$(T\\rightarrow Wb) = 0.5$, whereas the expected limit is\n1.10 TeV.\n", "  As normally used, no commercially available camera has a low-enough dark\nnoise to directly produce video recordings of double-slit interference at the\nphoton-by-photon level, because readout noise significantly contaminates or\noverwhelms the signal. In this work, noise levels are significantly reduced by\nturning on the camera only when the presence of a photon has been heralded by\nthe arrival, at an independent detector, of a time-correlated photon produced\nvia parametric down-conversion. This triggering scheme provides the improvement\nrequired for direct video imaging of Young's double-slit experiment with single\nphotons, allowing clarified versions of this foundational demonstration.\nFurther, we introduce variations on this experiment aimed at promoting\ndiscussion of the role spatial coherence plays in such a measurement. We also\nemphasize complementary aspects of single-photon measurement, where imaging\nyields (transverse) position information, while diffraction yields the\ntransverse momentum, and highlight the roles of transverse position and\nmomentum correlations between down-converted photons, including examples of\n\"ghost\" imaging and diffraction. The videos can be accessed at\nhttp://sun.iwu.edu/~gspaldin/SinglePhotonVideos.html online.\n", "  We find a new method for looking for the static and spherically symmetric\nsolutions in $F(R)$ theory of gravity. With this method, a number of new\nsolutions in terms of the analytic functions are obtained. We hope this\ninvestigation may be of some help in the searching for some other solutions in\n$F(R)$ theory of gravity.\n", "  Topological Weyl semimetals, besides manifesting chiral anomaly, can also\naccommodate a disorder-driven unconventional quantum phase transition into a\nmetallic phase. A fundamentally and practically important question in this\nregard concerns an experimentally measurable quantity that can clearly\ndistinguish these two phases. We show that the optical conductivity while\nserving this purpose can also play the role of a bonafide order parameter\nacross such disorder-driven semimetal-metal quantum phase transition by virtue\nof displaying distinct scaling behavior in semimetallic and metallic phases, as\nwell as inside the quantum critical fan supporting a non-Fermi liquid. We\ndemonstrate that the correction to dielectric constant and optical conductivity\nin a dirty Weyl semimetal due to weak disorder is independent of the actual\nnature of point-like impurity scatterers. Therefore, optical conductivity can\nbe used as an experimentally measurable quantity to study the critical\nproperties and to pin the universality class of the disorder-driven quantum\nphase transition in Weyl semimetals.\n", "  We study theoretically the interplay effect of Zeeman field and modulated\nspin-orbit coupling on topological properties of a one-dimensional dimerized\nlattice, known as Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. We find that in the weak (strong)\nmodulated spin-orbit coupling regime, trivial regions or nontrivial ones with\ntwo pairs of zero-energy states can be turned into nontrivial regions by\napplying a uniform (staggered) perpendicular Zeeman field through a topological\nphase transition. Furthermore, the resulting nontrivial phase hosting a pair of\nzero-energy boundary states can survive within a certain range of the\nperpendicular Zeeman field magnitude. Due to the effective time-reversal,\nparticle-hole, chiral, and inversion symmetries, in the presence of either\nuniform or staggered perpendicular Zeeman field, the topological class of the\nsystem is BDI which can be characterized by $\\mathbbm{Z}$ index. We also\nexamine the robustness of the nontrivial phase by breaking the underlying\nsymmetries giving rise that inversion symmetry plays an important role.\n", "  The existence of non-substitutional $\\beta$-Sn defects in Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$\nwas confirmed by emission channeling experiments [Decoster et al., Phys. Rev. B\n81, 155204 (2010)], which established that although most Sn enters\nsubstitutionally ($\\alpha$-Sn) in the Ge lattice, a second significant fraction\ncorresponds to the Sn-vacancy defect complex in the split-vacancy configuration\n( $\\beta$-Sn ), in agreement with our previous theoretical study [Ventura et\nal., Phys. Rev. B 79, 155202 (2009)]. Here, we present our electronic structure\ncalculation for Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$, including substitutional $\\alpha$-Sn as\nwell as non-substitutional $\\beta$-Sn defects. To include the presence of\nnon-substitutional complex defects in the electronic structure calculation for\nthis multi-orbital alloy problem, we extended the approach for the purely\nsubstitutional alloy by Jenkins and Dow [Jenkins and Dow, Phys. Rev. B 36, 7994\n(1987)]. We employed an effective substitutional two-site cluster equivalent to\nthe real non-substitutional $\\beta$-Sn defect, which was determined by a\nGreen's functions calculation. We then calculated the electronic structure of\nthe effective alloy purely in terms of substitutional defects, embedding the\neffective substitutional clusters in the lattice. Our results describe the two\ntransitions of the fundamental gap of Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_{x}$ as a function of the\ntotal Sn-concentration: namely from an indirect to a direct gap, first, and the\nmetallization transition at higher $x$. They also highlight the role of\n$\\beta$-Sn in the reduction of the concentration range which corresponds to the\ndirect-gap phase of this alloy, of interest for optoelectronics applications.\n", "  We give a sufficient condition under which an applied rotation on medium\nparticles stabilizes a slow probe in the rotation center. The symmetric part of\nthe stiffness matrix thus gets a positive Lamb shift with respect to\nequilibrium. For illustration we take diffusive medium particles with a\nself-potential in the shape of a Mexican hat, high around the origin. There is\na short-range attraction between the medium particles and the heavier probe,\nall immersed in an equilibrium thermal bath. For no or small rotation force on\nthe medium particles, the origin is an unstable fixed point for the probe and\nthe precise shape of the self-potential at large distances from the origin is\nirrelevant for the statistical force there. Above a certain rotation threshold,\nwhile the medium particles are still repelled from the origin, the probe\nstabilizes there and more details of the medium-density at large distance start\nto matter. The effect is robust around the quasi-static limit with rotation\nthreshold only weakly depending on the temperature but the stabilization gets\nstronger at lower temperatures.\n", "  Considering the growing interest of the astrophysicist community in the study\nof dissipative fluids with the aim of getting a more realistic description of\nthe universe, we present in this paper a physical analysis of the\nenergy-momentum tensor of a viscous fluid with heat flux. We introduce the\ngeneral form of this tensor and, using the approximation of small velocity\ngradients, we relate the stresses of the fluid with the viscosity coefficients,\nthe shear tensor and the expansion factor. Exploiting these relations, we can\nwrite the stresses in terms of the extrinsic curvature of the normal surface to\nthe 4-velocity vector of the fluid, and we can also establish a connection\nbetween the perfect fluid and the symmetries of the spacetime. On the other\nhand, we calculate the energy conditions for a dissipative fluid through\ncontractions of the energy-momentum tensor with the 4-velocity vector of an\narbitrary observer. This method is interesting because it allows us to compute\nthe conditions in a reasonable easy way and without considering any\napproximation or restriction on the energy-momentum tensor.\n", "  We study the half-filled Hubbard model on the triangular lattice with\nspin-dependent Kitaev-like hopping. Using the variational cluster approach, we\nidentify five phases: a metallic phase, a non-coplanar chiral magnetic order, a\n$120^\\circ$ magnetic order, a nonmagnetic insulator (NMI), and an interacting\nChern insulator (CI) with a nonzero Chern number. The transition from CI to NMI\nis characterized by the change of the charge gap from an indirect band gap to a\ndirect Mott gap. Based on the slave-rotor mean-field theory, the NMI phase is\nfurther suggested to be a gapless Mott insulator with a spinon Fermi surface or\na fractionalized CI with nontrivial spinon topology, depending on the strength\nof Kitaev-like hopping. Our work highlights the rising field that interesting\nphases emerge from the interplay of band topology and Mott physics.\n", "  We study quantum quenches to the one-dimensional Bose gas with attractive\ninteractions in the case when the initial state is an ideal one-dimensional\nBose condensate. We focus on properties of the stationary state reached at late\ntimes after the quench. This displays a finite density of multi-particle bound\nstates, whose rapidity distribution is determined exactly by means of the\nquench action method. We discuss the relevance of the multi-particle bound\nstates for the physical properties of the system, computing in particular the\nstationary value of the local pair correlation function $g_2$.\n", "  We consider Gauss-Bonnet (GB) gravity in general dimensions, which is\nnon-minimally coupled to a scalar field. By choosing the scalar potential of\nthe type $V(\\phi)=2\\Lambda_0+\\fft 12m^2\\phi^2+\\gamma_4\\phi^4$, we first obtain\nlarge classes of scalar hairy black holes with spherical/hyperbolic/planar\ntopologies that are asymptotic to locally anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-times. We\nderive the first law of black hole thermodynamics using Wald formalism. In\nparticular, for one class of the solutions, the scalar hair forms a\nthermodynamic conjugate with the graviton and nontrivially contributes to the\nthermodynamical first law. We observe that except for one class of the planar\nblack holes, all these solutions are constructed at the critical point of GB\ngravity where there exists an unique AdS vacua. In fact, Lifshitz vacuum is\nalso allowed at the critical point. We then construct many new classes of\nneutral and charged Lifshitz black hole solutions for a either minimally or\nnon-minimally coupled scalar and derive the thermodynamical first laws. We also\nobtain new classes of exact dynamical AdS and Lifshitz solutions which describe\nradiating white holes. The solutions eventually become an AdS or Lifshitz vacua\nat late retarded times. However, for one class of the solutions the final state\nis an AdS space-time with a globally naked singularity.\n", "  Reactor neutrino experiments build large-scale detector systems to detect\nneutrinos. In liquid scintillator, a neutral bound state of a positron and an\nelectron, named positronium, can be formed. The spin triplet state is called\northo-positronium (o-Ps). In this article, an experiment is designed to measure\nthe lifetime of o-Ps, giving a result of 3.1 ns. A PSD parameter based on\nphoton emission time distribution (PETD) was constructed to discriminate\ne$^+$/e$^-$. Finally, the application of e$^+$/e$^-$ discrimination in the JUNO\nexperiment is shown. It helps suppress $^{8}$He/$^{9}$Li backgrounds and\nimproves the sensitivity by 0.6 in $\\chi^2$ analysis with an assumption of\n$\\sigma$=1 ns PMT Transit Time Spread, which will bring a smearing effect to\nthe PETD.\n", "  We investigate the nucleon to $\\Delta$ transition form factors in a soft-wall\nAdS/QCD model and a light-front quark-diquark model inspired by AdS/QCD. From\nthe transition form factors we evaluate the transition charge densities which\ninfluences the nucleon to $\\Delta$ excitation. Here we consider both the\nunpolarized and the transversely polarized cases. The AdS/QCD predictions are\ncompared with available experimental data and with the results of the global\nparameterization, MAID2007.\n", "  We derive the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) sensitivity to dark matter (DM)\nannihilation in several primary channels, over a broad range of DM masses.\nThese sensitivities are estimated when CTA is pointed towards a large sample of\nMilky Way's dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) with promising $J$-factors and\nsmall statistical uncertainties. This analysis neglects systematic\nuncertainties, which we estimate at the level of at least 1 dex. We also\npresent sensitivities on the annihilation cross section from a combined\nanalysis of 4 dSphs. We assess the CTA sensitivity by: $i)$ using, for each\ndSph, a recent determination of the $J$-factor and its statistical error; $ii)$\nconsidering the most up-to-date cosmic ray background; and $iii)$ including\nboth spatial and spectral terms in the likelihood analysis. We find that a\njoint spectral and spatial analysis improves the CTA sensitivity, in particular\nfor primary channels with sharp features in the $\\gamma$-ray energy spectrum\nand for dSphs with steep $J$-factor profiles, as deduced from the internal\nkinematics. The greatest sensitivities are obtained for observations of Ursa\nMinor among the classical dSphs and of Ursa Major II for ultra-faint dSphs.\n", "  We investigate the magnetization processes of a standard Ginzburg-Landau\nmodel for chiral p-wave superconducting states in an applied magnetic field. We\nfind that the phase diagram is dominated by triangular lattices of doubly\nquantized vortices. Only in close vicinity to the upper critical field, the\nlattice starts to dissociate into a structure of single-quanta vortices. The\ndegeneracy between states with opposite chirality is broken in a nonzero field.\nIf the magnetization starts with an energetically unfavorable chirality, the\nprocess of chirality-inversion induced by the external magnetic field results\nin the formation of a sequence of metastable states with characteristic\nmagnetic signatures that can be probed by standard experimental techniques.\n", "  We present first heavenly equation of Pleba\\'nski in a two-component\nevolutionary form and obtain Lagrangian and Hamiltonian representations of this\nsystem. We study all point symmetries of the two-component system and, using\nthe inverse Noether theorem in the Hamiltonian form, obtain all the integrals\nof motion corresponding to each variational (Noether) symmetry. We derive two\nlinearly independent recursion operators for symmetries of this system related\nby a discrete symmetry of both the two-component system and its symmetry\ncondition. Acting by these operators on the first Hamiltonian operator $J_0$ we\nobtain second and third Hamiltonian operators. However, we were not able to\nfind Hamiltonian densities corresponding to the latter two operators.\nTherefore, we construct two recursion operators, which are either even or odd,\nrespectively, under the above-mentioned discrete symmetry. Acting with them on\n$J_0$, we generate another two Hamiltonian operators $J_+$ and $J_-$ and find\nthe corresponding Hamiltonian densities, thus obtaining second and third\nHamiltonian representations for the first heavenly equation in a two-component\nform. Using P. Olver's theory of the functional multi-vectors, we check that\nthe linear combination of $J_0$, $J_+$ and $J_-$ with arbitrary constant\ncoefficients satisfies Jacobi identities. Since their skew symmetry is obvious,\nthese three operators are compatible Hamiltonian operators and hence we obtain\na tri-Hamiltonian representation of the first heavenly equation. Our\nwell-founded conjecture applied here is that P. Olver's method works fine for\nnonlocal operators and our proof of the Jacobi identities and bi-Hamiltonian\nstructures crucially depends on the validity of this conjecture.\n", "  In this Letter, we study the magnetic transport in AA-stacked bilayer\nhoneycomb chiral magnets coupled either ferromagnetically or\nantiferromagnetically. For both couplings, we observe chirality-induced gaps,\nchiral protected edge states, magnon Hall and magnon spin Nernst effects of\nmagnetic spin excitations. For ferromagnetically coupled layers, thermal Hall\nand spin Nernst conductivities do not change sign as function of magnetic field\nor temperature similar to single-layer honeycomb ferromagnetic insulator. In\ncontrast, for antiferromagnetically coupled layers, we observe a sign change in\nthe thermal Hall and spin Nernst conductivities as the magnetic field is\nreversed. We discuss possible experimental accessible honeycomb bilayer quantum\nmaterials in which these effects can be observed.\n", "  For systems with infinite-order phase transitions, in which an order\nparameter smoothly becomes nonzero, a new observable for finite-size scaling\nanalysis is suggested. By construction this new observable has the favourable\nproperty of diverging at the critical point. Focussing on the example of the\nF-model we compare the analysis of this observable with that of another\nobservable, which is also derived from the order parameter but does not\ndiverge, as well as that of the associated susceptibility. We discuss the\ndifficulties that arise in the finite-size scaling analysis of such systems. In\nparticular we show that one may reach incorrect conclusions from large-system\nsize extrapolations of observables that are not known to diverge at the\ncritical point. Our work suggests that one should base finite-size scaling\nanalyses for infinite-order phase transitions only on observables that are\nguaranteed to diverge.\n", "  We study one-dimensional topological superconductivity in the presence of\ntime-reversal symmetry. This phase is characterized by having a bulk gap, while\nsupporting a Kramers' pair of zero-energy Majorana bound states at each of its\nends. We present a general simple model which is driven into this topological\nphase in the presence of repulsive electron-electron interactions. We further\npropose two experimental setups and show that they realize this model at low\nenergies. The first setup is a narrow two-dimensional topological insulator\npartially covered by a conventional s-wave superconductor, and the second is a\nsemiconductor wire in proximity to an s-wave superconductor. These systems can\ntherefore be used to realize and probe the time-reversal invariant topological\nsuperconducting phase. The effect of interactions is studied using both a\nmean-field approach and a renormalization group analysis.\n", "  How change in molecular structure can affect relative stability and\nstructural properties of the twist-bend nematic phase (N$_\\text{TB}$)? Here we\nextend the mean-field model [C. Greco et al., Soft Matter, 2014, 10, 9318] for\nbent-shaped achiral molecules, to study the influence of arm molecular\nbiaxiality and the value of molecule's bend angle on relative stability of\nN$_\\text{TB}$. In particular we show that by controlling biaxiality of\nmolecule's arms up to four ordered phases can become stable. They involve\nlocally uniaxial and biaxial variants of N$_\\text{TB}$, together with the\nuniaxial and the biaxial nematic phases. However, the V-shaped molecule show\nstronger ability to form stable N$_\\text{TB}$ than a biaxial nematic phase,\nwhere the latter phase appears in the phase diagram only for bend angles\ngreater than $140^\\circ$ and for large biaxiality of the two arms.\n", "  We derive structural and binding energy trends for twenty amino acids, their\ndipeptides, and their interactions with the divalent cations Ca$^{2+}$,\nBa$^{2+}$, Sr$^{2+}$, Cd$^{2+}$, Pb$^{2+}$, and Hg$^{2+}$. The underlying data\nset consists of 45,892 first-principles predicted conformers with relative\nenergies up to about 4 eV (about 400kJ/mol). We show that only very few\ndistinct backbone structures of isolated amino acids and their dipeptides\nemerge as lowest-energy conformers. The isolated amino acids predominantly\nadopt structures that involve an acidic proton shared between the carboxy and\namino function. Dipeptides adopt one of two intramolecular-hydrogen bonded\nconformations C$_5$ or equatorial C$_7$. Upon complexation with a divalent\ncation, the accessible conformational space shrinks and intramolecular hydrogen\nbonding is prevented due to strong electrostatic interaction of backbone and\nside chain functional groups with cations. Clear correlations emerge from the\nbinding energies of the six divalent ions with amino acids and dipeptides.\nCd$^{2+}$ and Hg$^{2+}$ show the largest binding energies - a potential\ncorrelation with their known high acute toxicities. Ca$^{2+}$ and Pb$^{2+}$\nreveal almost identical binding energies across the entire series of amino\nacids and dipeptides. This observation validates past indications that\nion-mimicry of calcium and lead should play an important role in a\ntoxicological context.\n", "  We consider a general class of approximations which guarantees the\nconservation of particle number in many-body perturbation theory. To do this we\nextend the concept of $\\Phi$-derivability for the self-energy $\\Sigma$ to a\nlarger class of diagrammatic terms in which only some of the Green's function\nlines contain the fully dressed Green's function $G$. We call the corresponding\napproximations for $\\Sigma$ partially $\\Phi$-derivable. A special subclass of\nsuch approximations, which are gauge-invariant, is obtained by dressing loops\nin the diagrammatic expansion of $\\Phi$ consistently with $G$. These\napproximations are number conserving but do not have to fulfill other\nconservation laws, such as the conservation of energy and momentum. From our\nformalism we can easily deduce if commonly used approximations will fulfill the\ncontinuity equation, which implies particle number conservation. We further\nshow how the concept of partial $\\Phi$-derivability plays an important role in\nthe derivation of a generalized sum rule for the particle number, which reduces\nto the Luttinger-Ward theorem in the case of a homogeneous electron gas, and\nthe Friedel sum rule in the case of the Anderson model. To do this we need to\nensure that the Green's function has certain complex analytic properties, which\ncan be guaranteed if the spectral function is positive semi-definite.The latter\nproperty can be ensured for a subset of partially $\\Phi$-derivable\napproximations for the self-energy, namely those that can be constructed from\nsquares of so-called half-diagrams. In case the analytic requirements are not\nfulfilled we highlight a number of subtle issues related to branch cuts, pole\nstructure and multi-valuedness. We also show that various schemes of computing\nthe particle number are consistent for particle number conserving\napproximations.\n", "  We calculate dynamical spin structure factors for gapped chiral spin liquid\nstates in the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice using\nSchwinger-boson mean-field theory. In contrast to static (equal-time) structure\nfactors, the dynamical structure factor shows clear signatures of time-reversal\nsymmetry breaking for chiral spin liquid states. In particular, momentum\ninversion $\\bm{k} \\to -\\bm{k}$ symmetry as well as the six-fold rotation\nsymmetry around the $\\Gamma$-point are lost. We highlight other interesting\nfeatures, such as a relatively flat onset of the two-spinon continuum for the\n\\emph{cuboc1} state. Our work is based on the projective symmetry group\nclassification of time-reversal symmetry breaking Schwinger-boson mean-field\nstates by Messio, Lhuillier, and Misguich.\n", "  We compute the two-loop O(as*at) corrections to the Higgs boson masses in\nsupersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model with Dirac gaugino masses. We\nrely on the effective-potential technique, allow for both Dirac and Majorana\nmass terms for the gluinos, and compute the corrections in both the DRbar and\non-shell renormalisation schemes. We give detailed results for the MDGSSM and\nthe MRSSM, and simple approximate formulae valid in the decoupling limit for\nall currently-studied variants of supersymmetric models with Dirac gluinos.\nThese results represent the first explicit two-loop calculation of Higgs boson\nmasses in supersymmetric models beyond the MSSM and the NMSSM.\n", "  We consider a minimally-coupled inflationary theory with a general scalar\npotential $V(f(\\varphi))= V(\\xi\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\lambda_k \\varphi^k)$ containing a\nstationary point of maximal order $m$. We show that asymptotically flat\npotentials can be associated to stationary points of infinite order and discuss\nthe relation of our approach to the theory of $\\alpha$-attractors.\n", "  Recently, a model for an emergent gravity based on $SO(5)$ Yang-Mills action\nin Euclidian 4-dimensional spacetime was proposed. In this work we provide some\n1 and 2-loops computations and show that the model can accommodate suitable\npredicting values for the Newtonian constant. Moreover, it is shown that the\ntypical scale of the expected transition between the quantum and the\ngeometrodynamical theory is consistent with Planck scale. We also provide a\ndiscussion on the cosmological constant problem.\n", "  We investigate the entanglement entropy (EE) of circular entangling cuts in\nthe 2+1-dimensional quantum Lifshitz model, whose ground state wave function is\na spatially conformal invariant state of the Rokhsar-Kivelson type, whose\nweight is the Gibbs weight of 2D Euclidean free boson. We show that the finite\nsubleading corrections of EE to the area-law term as well as the mutual\ninformation are conformal invariants and calculate them for cylinder, disk-like\nand spherical manifolds with various spatial cuts. The subtlety due to the\nboson compactification in the replica trick is carefully addressed. We find\nthat in the geometry of a punctured plane with many small holes, the constant\npiece of EE is proportional to the number of holes, indicating the ability of\nentanglement to detect topological information of the configuration. Finally,\nwe compare the mutual information of two small distant disks with Cardy's\nrelativistic CFT scaling proposal. We find that in the quantum Lifshitz model,\nthe mutual information also scales at long distance with a power determined by\nthe lowest scaling dimension local operator in the theory.\n", "  We have characterized the robust propagation modes of electromagnetic waves\nin helical structures by the section Chern number that is defined for a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) section of the three- dimensional (3D) Brillouin zone. The\nWeyl point in the photonic bands is associated with a dis- continuous jump of\nthe section Chern number. A spatially localized Gaussian basis set is used to\ncalculate the section Chern numbers where we have implemented the\ndivergence-free condition on each basis function in 3D. The validity of the\nbulk-edge correspondence in a 3D photonic crystal is discussed in relation to\nthe broken inversion symmetry.\n", "  While halogenation of graphene presents a fascinating avenue to the\nconstruction of a chemically and physically diverse class of systems, their\napplication in photovoltaics has been hindered by often prohibitively large\noptical gaps. Herein we study the effects of partial bromination and\nchlorination on the structure and optoelectronic properties of both graphane\nand fluorographene. We find brominated and chlorinated fluorographene\nderivatives to be as stable as graphane making them likely to be durable even\nat elevated temperatures. A detailed investigation of the systems band\nstructure reveals significant 1D localization of the charge carriers as well as\nstrongly electron-hole asymmetric effective masses. Lastly using $G_0W_0$ and\nBSE, we investigate the optical adsorption spectra of the aforementioned\nmaterials whose first adsorption peak is shown to lie close to the optimal peak\nposition for photovoltaic applications ($\\approx 1.5$ eV).\n", "  We give a new class of security definitions for authentication in the quantum\nsetting. These definitions capture and strengthen existing definitions of\nsecurity against quantum adversaries for both classical message authentication\ncodes (MACs) and well as full quantum state authentication schemes. The main\nfeature of our definitions is that they precisely characterize the effective\nbehavior of any adversary when the authentication protocol accepts, including\ncorrelations with the key. Our definitions readily yield a host of desirable\nproperties and interesting consequences; for example, our security definition\nfor full quantum state authentication implies that the entire secret key can be\nre-used if the authentication protocol succeeds.\n  Next, we present several protocols satisfying our security definitions. We\nshow that the classical Wegman-Carter authentication scheme with 3-universal\nhashing is secure against superposition attacks, as well as adversaries with\nquantum side information. We then present conceptually simple constructions of\nfull quantum state authentication.\n  Finally, we prove a lifting theorem which shows that, as long as a protocol\ncan securely authenticate the maximally entangled state, it can securely\nauthenticate any state, even those that are entangled with the adversary. Thus,\nthis shows that protocols satisfying a fairly weak form of authentication\nsecurity automatically satisfy a stronger notion of security (in particular,\nthe definition of Dupuis, et al (2012)).\n", "  We study the jet activity that accompanies the production by gluon fusion of\na new physics scalar particle decaying into photons at the LHC. In the\nconsidered scenarios, both the production and decay mechanisms are governed by\nloop-induced interactions involving a heavy colored state. We show that the\npresence of large new physics contributions to the inclusive diphoton\ninvariant-mass spectrum always implies a significant production rate of\nnon-standard diphoton events containing extra hard jets. We investigate the\nexistence of possible handles that could provide a way to obtain information on\nthe underlying physics behind the scalar resonance, and this in a wide mass\nwindow.\n", "  We correct our previous conclusion regarding the fate of a charged quantum\ncritical point across the superconducting transition for two dimensional\nmassless Dirac fermion. Within the leading order $\\epsilon$ expansion, we now\nfind that the requisite number of four-component Dirac fermion flavors ($N_f$)\nfor the continuous phase transition through a charged critical point is\n$N_f>18.2699$. For $N_f\\geq1/2$, the critical number of bosonic flavors for\nthis transition is significantly reduced as compared to the value determined in\nthe absence of the Dirac fermions in the theory.\n", "  In a space of 4-dimensions, I will examine constrained variational problems\nin which the Lagrangian, and constraint scalar density, are concomitants of a\n(pseudo-Riemannian) metric tensor and its first two derivatives. The Lagrange\nmultiplier for these constrained extremal problems will be a scalar field. For\nsuitable choices of the Lagrangian, and constraint, we can obtain\nEuler-Lagrange equations which are second order in the scalar field and third\norder in the metric tensor. The effect of disformal transformations on the\nconstraint Lagrangians, and their generalizations, is examined. This will yield\nother second order scalar-tensor Lagrangians which yield field equations which\nare at most of third order. No attempt is made to construct all possible third\norder scalar-tensor Euler-Lagrange equations in a 4-space, although nine\nclasses of such field equations are presented. Two of these classes admit\nsubclasses which yield conformally invariant field equations. A few remarks on\nscalar-tensor-connection theories are also presented.\n", "  Heterostructures of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC)\nhave shown promise for various applications in optoelectronics and so-called\nvalleytronics. Their operation and performance strongly depend on the stacking\nof individual layers. Here, optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) in imaging\nmode is shown to be a versatile tool for systematic time-resolved\ninvestigations of TMDC monolayers and heterostructures in consideration of the\nmaterial's structure. Large sample areas can be probed in a single shot without\nthe need of any mapping or scanning. By means of polarization dependent\nmeasurements, the crystalline orientation of monolayers or the stacking angles\nof heterostructures can be evaluated for the whole field of view. Pump-probe\nexperiments then allow to correlate observed transient changes of the second\nharmonic response with the underlying structure. The corresponding\ntime-resolution is virtually limited by the pulse duration of the used laser.\nAs an example, polarization dependent and time-resolved measurements on\nsingle-layer MoS2 and WS2 flakes grown on a SiO2/Si(001) substrate are\npresented.\n", "  We study the self-similar motion of a string in a self-similar spacetime by\nintroducing the concept of a self-similar string, which is defined as the world\nsheet to which a homothetic vector field is tangent. It is shown that in\nNambu-Goto theory, the equations of motion for a self-similar string reduce to\nthose for a particle. Moreover, under certain conditions such as the\nhypersurface orthogonality of the homothetic vector field, the equations of\nmotion for a self-similar string simplify to the geodesic equations on a\n(pseudo) Riemannian space. As a concrete example, we investigate a self-similar\nNambu-Goto string in a spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker\nexpanding universe with self-similarity and obtain solutions of open and closed\nstrings, which have various nontrivial configurations depending on the rate of\nthe cosmic expansion. For instance, we obtain a circular solution that evolves\nlinearly in the cosmic time while keeping its configuration by the balance\nbetween the effects of the cosmic expansion and string tension. We also show\nthe instability for linear radial perturbation of the circular solutions.\n", "  As one of the most important elements in astronomy, iron abundance\ndeterminations need to be as accurate as possible. We investigate the accuracy\nof spectroscopic iron abundance analyses using archetypal metal-poor stars. We\nperform detailed 3D non-LTE radiative transfer calculations based on 3D\nhydrodynamic Stagger model atmospheres, and employ a new model atom that\nincludes new quantum-mechanical neutral hydrogen collisional rate coefficients.\nWith the exception of the red giant HD122563, we find that the 3D non-LTE\nmodels achieve Fe i/Fe ii excitation and ionization balance as well as not\nhaving any trends with equivalent width to within modelling uncertainties of\n0.05 dex, all without having to invoke any microturbulent broadening; for\nHD122563 we predict that the current best parallax-based surface gravity is\nover-estimated by 0.5 dex. Using a 3D non-LTE analysis, we infer iron\nabundances from the 3D model atmospheres that are roughly 0.1 dex higher than\ncorresponding abundances from 1D MARCS model atmospheres; these differences go\nin the same direction as the non-LTE effects themselves. We make available\ngrids of departure coefficients, equivalent widths and abundance corrections,\ncalculated on 1D MARCS model atmospheres and horizontally- and\ntemporally-averaged 3D Stagger model atmospheres.\n", "  This paper presents an investigation of the age-dependent size effect and\nfracture characteristics of an ultra high performance concrete (UHPC). The\nstudy is based on a unique set of experimental data connecting aging tests for\ntwo curing protocols of one size and scaled size effect tests of one age. Both\naging and size effect studies are performed on notched three point bending\ntests. Experimental data is augmented by state of the art simulations employing\na recently developed discrete element based early-age computational framework.\nThe framework is constructed by coupling a hygro-thermo-chemical (HTC) model\nand the Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM) through a set of aging\nfunctions. The HTC component allows taking into account variable curing\nconditions and predicts the maturity of concrete. The mechanical component,\nLDPM, simulates the failure behavior of concrete at the length scale of major\nheterogeneities. After careful calibration and validation the mesoscale\nHTC-LDPM model is uniquely posed to perform predictive simulations. The\nultimate flexural strengths from experiments and simulations are analyzed by\nthe cohesive size effect curve (CSEC) method, and the classical size effect law\n(SEL). The fracture energies obtained by LDPM, CSEC, SEL, and cohesive crack\nanalyses are compared and an aging formulation for fracture properties is\nproposed. Based on experiments, simulations, and size effect analyses, the\nage-dependence of size effect and the robustness of analytical size effect\nmethods are evaluated.\n", "  We present ~2000 polarimetric and ~3000 photometric observations of 15\ngamma-ray bright blazars over a period of 936 days (11/10/2008 - 26/10/2012)\nusing data from the Tuorla blazar monitoring program (KVA DIPOL) and Liverpool\nTelescope (LT) RINGO2 polarimeters (supplemented with data from SkyCamZ (LT)\nand Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data). In 11 out of 15 sources we identify a total of\n19 electric vector position angle (EVPA) rotations and 95 flaring episodes. We\ngroup the sources into subclasses based on their broadband spectral\ncharacteristics and compare their observed optical and gamma-ray properties. We\nfind that (1) the optical magnitude and gamma-ray flux are positively\ncorrelated, (2) EVPA rotations can occur in any blazar subclass, 4 sources show\nrotations that go in one direction and immediately rotate back, (3) we see no\ndifference in the gamma-ray flaring rates in the sample; flares can occur\nduring and outside of rotations with no preference for this behaviour, (4) the\naverage degree of polarisation (DoP), optical magnitude and gamma-ray flux are\nlower during an EVPA rotation compared with during non-rotation and the\ndistribution of the DoP during EVPA rotations is not drawn from the same parent\nsample as the distribution outside rotations, (5) the number of observed\nflaring events and optical polarisation rotations are correlated, however we\nfind no strong evidence for a temporal association between individual flares\nand rotations and (6) the maximum observed DoP increases from ~10% to ~30% to\n~40% for subclasses with synchrotron peaks at high, intermediate and low\nfrequencies respectively.\n", "  We present the first linear polarimetric survey of white dwarfs (WDs). Our\nsample consists of WDs of DA and DC spectral types in the SDSS r magnitude\nrange from 13 to 17. We performed polarimetric observations with the RoboPol\npolarimeter attached to the 1.3-m telescope at the Skinakas Observatory. We\nhave 74 WDs in our sample, of which almost all are low polarized WDs with\npolarization degree (PD) smaller than 1%, while only 2 have PD higher than 1%.\nThere is an evidence that on average the isolated WDs of DC type have higher PD\n(with median PD of 0.78%) than the isolated DA type WDs (with median PD of\n0.36%). On the other hand, the median PD of isolated DA type WDs is almost the\nsame, i.e. 0.36% as the median PD of DA type white dwarfs in binary systems\nwith red dwarfs (dM type), i.e. 0.33%. This shows, as expected, that there is\nno contribution to the PD from the companion if the WD companion is the red\ndwarf, which is the most common situation for WDs binary systems. We do not\nfind differences in the polarization degree between magnetic and non-magnetic\nWDs. Because 97% of WDs in our sample have PD lower than 1%, they can be used\nas faint zero--polarized standard star in the magnitude range from 13 up to 17\nof SDSS r filter. They cover the Northern sky between 13 hour to 23 hour in\nright ascension and from -11 degrees to 78 degrees in declination.\nAdditionally, we found that for low extinction values (< 0.04) the best model\nthat describes the dependence of PD on E(B-V) is given by the equation:\nPD_{max, ISM}[%] = 0.65 x E(B-V)^{0.12}.\n", "  We characterize the fluctuation properties of a polymer chain under external\ntension and the fluctuation-induced forces between two ring molecules threaded\naround the chain. The problem is relevant in the context of fluctuation-induced\nforces in soft matter systems, features of liquid interfaces and to describe\nproperties of polyrotaxanes and slide-ring materials. We perform molecular\ndynamics simulations of the Kremer-Grest bead-spring model for the polymer and\na simple ring-molecule model, in the canonical ensemble. We study transverse\nfluctuations of the stretched chain, as a function of chain stretching and in\nthe presence of ring-shaped threaded molecules. The fluctuation spectra of the\nchains are analyzed in equilibrium at constant temperature and the differences\nin presence of two ring molecules are compared. For the rings located at fixed\ndistances, we find an attractive fluctuation-induced force between the rings,\nproportional to the temperature and decaying with the ring distance. We\ncharacterize this force as a function of ring distance, chain stretching, ring\nradius and measure the differences between the free chain spectrum and the\nfluctuations of the chain constrained by the rings. We also compare the\ndependence and range of the force found in the simulations with theoretical\nmodels coming from different fields.\n", "  Most known four-dimensional cohomogeneity-one Einstein metrics are diagonal\nin the basis defined by the left-invariant one-forms, though some essentially\nnon-diagonal ones are known. We consider the problem of explicitly seeking\nnon-diagonal Einstein metrics, and we find solutions which in some cases\nexhaust the possibilities. In particular we construct new examples of neutral\nsignature non--diagonal Bianchi type VIII Einstein metrics with self--dual Weyl\ntensor.\n", "  We report on recent results on radiative and electroweak penguin B decays at\nBelle at KEKB accelerator.\n", "  A combined dynamics consisting of Brownian motion and L\\'evy flights is\nexhibited by a variety of biological systems performing search processes.\nAssessing the search reliability of ever locating the target and the search\nefficiency of doing so economically of such dynamics thus poses an important\nproblem. Here we model this dynamics by a one-dimensional fractional\nFokker-Planck equation combining unbiased Brownian motion and L\\'evy flights.\nBy solving this equation both analytically and numerically we show that the\nsuperposition of recurrent Brownian motion and L\\'evy flights with stable\nexponent $\\alpha<1$, by itself implying zero probability of hitting a point on\na line, lead to transient motion with finite probability of hitting any point\non the line. We present results for the exact dependence of the values of both\nthe search reliability and the search efficiency on the distance between the\nstarting and target positions as well as the choice of the scaling exponent\n$\\alpha$ of the L\\'evy flight component.\n", "  In this paper we investigate how observational effects could possibly bias\ncosmological inferences from peculiar velocity measurements. Specifically, we\nlook at how bulk flow measurements are compared with theoretical predictions.\nUsually bulk flow calculations try to approximate the flow that would occur in\na sphere around the observer. Using the Horizon Run 2 simulation we show that\nthe traditional methods for bulk flow estimation can overestimate the magnitude\nof the bulk flow for two reasons: when the survey geometry is not spherical\n(the data do not cover the whole sky), and when the observations undersample\nthe velocity distributions. Our results may explain why several bulk flow\nmeasurements found bulk flow velocities that seem larger than those expected in\nstandard {\\Lambda}CDM cosmologies. We recommend a different approach when\ncomparing bulk flows to cosmological models, in which the theoretical\nprediction for each bulk flow measurement is calculated specifically for the\ngeometry and sampling rate of that survey. This means that bulk flow values\nwill not be comparable between surveys, but instead they are comparable with\ncosmological models, which is the more important measure.\n", "  The interaction between the magnetic field and the elastic deformation field\nin the crust is studied in a simplified way. The magnetic fields generated by\nthe line singularities in a magnetized elastic half-plane are investigated.\nUsing the general solution and Fourier transform technique, the exact solutions\nfor the generated magnetic inductions due to various cases are obtained in a\nclosed form. The results show that the line concentrated force will induced a\nperturbed magnetic field; The induced magnetic field will indicate the line\nconcentrated force in reverse. The distribution of the vertical component of\nthe magnetic induction caused by the line mechanical singularities is simpler\nthan that of the horizontal component, and it is zero at the origin when the\napplied magnetic field and the line concentrated force satisfies some\nconditions. This result is applied to locate the epicenters of the earthquakes\nand historical earthquakes occurred in the Chinese continental crust. Results\nshow that more than 80\\% epicenters are at or near the zero-contours of the\nvertical component of the magnetic induction observed from satellite. These\nregions of zero-contours, especially those in active tectonic zones, could be\nthe possible seismogenic zones in the future. The zero-contours of the vertical\ncomponent of the magnetic induction from satellite could be as geophysical\nconstraints to the risk information on the shallow seismicities, or they can be\nused as an early monitor for the shallow seismicities in the continental crust,\nor an auxiliary sign in the determination of the great historical earthquake.\n", "  The high radio frequency polarization imaging of non-thermal emission from\nactive galactic nuclei (AGN) is a direct way to probe the magnetic field\nstrength and structure in the immediate vicinity of supermassive black holes\n(SMBHs) and is crucial in testing the jet-launching scenario. To explore the\nthe magnetic field configuration at the base of jets in blazars, we took\nadvantage of the full polarization capabilities of the Global Millimeter VLBI\nArray (GMVA). With an angular resolution of $\\sim$50 micro-arcseconds ($\\mu$as)\nat 86 GHz, one could resolve scales up to $\\sim$450 gravitational radii (for a\n10$^9$ solar mass black hole at a redshift of 0.1). We present here the\npreliminary results of our study on the blazar BL~Lac. Our results suggest that\non sub-mas scales the core and the central jet of BL Lac are significantly\npolarized with two distinct regions of polarized intensity. We also noted a\ngreat morphological similarity between the 7mm/3mm VLBI images at very similar\nangular resolution.\n", "  The matter-antimatter asymmetry problem, corresponding to the virtual\nnonexistence of antimatter in the universe, is one of the greatest mysteries of\ncosmology. Within the framework of the Generation Model (GM) of particle\nphysics, it is demonstrated that the matter-antimatter asymmetry problem may be\nunderstood in terms of the composite leptons and quarks of the GM. It is\nconcluded that there is essentially no matter-antimatter asymmetry in the\npresent universe and that the observed hydrogen-antihydrogen asymmetry may be\nunderstood in terms of statistical fluctuations associated with the complex\nmany-body processes involved in the formation of either a hydrogen atom or an\nantihydrogen atom.\n", "  The Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI) famously avoids the issue of wave\nfunction collapse. Different MWI trees representing the same quantum events can\nhave different topologies, depending upon the observer. However, they are all\nisomorphic to the group of block universes containing all of the outcomes of\nall of the events, and so, in that sense, the group of block universes is a\nmore fundamental representation. Different branches of the MWI tree,\nrepresenting different universes in MWI, ultimately share the same quantum\nstate in a common ancestor branch. This branching topology is incompatible with\nthat of the Minkowski block universe; the resolution is to replace the branches\nwith discrete, parallel block universes, each of which extends from the trunk\nto the outermost twigs. The number of universes in a branch is proportional to\nits thickness which, in turn, depends upon the absolute square of the\nprobability amplitude for the state in that branch. Every quantum event may be\nrepresented by a kernel of universes, which is the smallest group of universes\nthat will reproduce the quantum probabilities of the outcomes of that event. By\nconsidering the ratios of the probabilities of the outcomes of any event, it\ncan be shown that the number of universes in every kernel must finite, as must\nbe the total number of universes in the multiverse. Further, every universe in\nthe multiverse must be finite both in space and time. Another consequence is\nthat quantum probabilities must be rational, which suggests that quantum\nmechanics is only an approximation to a discrete theory. A corollary is that\nnot every conceivable universe exists in the multiverse, no doubt to the\ndisappointment of those who enjoy alternate-history novels.\n", "  In the framework of cavity QED, we propose a quantum repeater scheme that\nuses coherent light and chains of atoms coupled to optical cavities. In\ncontrast to conventional repeater schemes, we avoid the usage of two-qubit\nquantum logical gates by exploiting solely the cavity QED evolution. In our\nprevious paper [D. Gonta and P. van Loock: Phys. Rev. A 88, 052308 (2013)], we\nalready proposed a quantum repeater in which the entanglement between two\nneighboring repeater nodes was distributed using controlled displacements of\ninput coherent light, while the produced low-fidelity entangled pairs were\npurified using ancillary (four-partite) entangled states. In this paper, the\nentanglement distribution is realized using a sequence of controlled phase\nshifts and displacements of input coherent light. Compared to previous\ncoherent-state-based distribution schemes for two-qubit entanglement, the\npresent scheme relies only upon a simple discrimination of two coherent states\nwith opposite signs, which can be performed in a quantum mechanically optimal\nfashion via a beam splitter and two on-off detectors. The entanglement\npurification utilizes a scheme that avoids the usage of ancillary entangled\nresources. Our repeater scheme exhibits reasonable fidelities and repeater\nrates providing an attractive platform for long-distance quantum communication.\n", "  Recent measurements by the T2K neutrino oscillation experiment indicate that\nCP violation in neutrino mixing may be observed in the future by long-baseline\nneutrino oscillation experiments. We propose an extension to the currently\napproved T2K running from $7.8\\times 10^{21}~\\mbox{POT}$ to $20\\times\n10^{21}~\\mbox{POT}$, aiming at initial observation of CP violation with\n3$\\,\\sigma$ or higher significance for the case of maximum CP violation. The\nprogram also contains a measurement of mixing parameters, $\\theta_{23}$ and\n$\\Delta m^2_{32}$, with a precision of 1.7$^\\circ$ or better and 1%,\nrespectively. With accelerator and beamline upgrades, as well as analysis\nimprovements, this program would occur before the next generation of\nlong-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments that are expected to start\noperation in 2026.\n", "  We report the observation of magnetoresistance originating from Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a metallic heterostructure: the Rashba-Edelstein\n(RE) magnetoresistance. We show that the simultaneous action of the direct and\ninverse RE effects in a Bi/Ag/CoFeB trilayer couples current-induced spin\naccumulation to the electric resistance. The electric resistance changes with\nthe magnetic-field angle, reminiscent of the spin Hall magnetoresistance,\ndespite the fact that bulk SOC is not responsible for the magnetoresistance. We\nfurther found that, even when the magnetization is saturated, the resistance\nincreases with increasing the magnetic-field strength, which is attributed to\nthe Hanle magnetoresistance in this system.\n", "  We discuss the Seebeck coefficient and the Hall mobility of electrons\nconfined in narrow SrTiO3 quantum wells as a function of the three-dimensional\ncarrier density and temperature. The quantum wells contain a fixed sheet\ncarrier density of ~ 7x10^14 cm^-2 and their thickness is varied. At high\ntemperatures, both properties exhibit apparent Fermi liquid behavior. In\nparticular, the Seebeck coefficient increases nearly linearly with temperature\n(T) when phonon drag contributions are minimized, while the mobility decreases\nproportional to T^2. Furthermore, the Seebeck coefficient scales inversely with\nthe Fermi energy (decreasing quantum well thickness). In contrast, the\ntransport scattering rate is independent of the Fermi energy, which is\ninconsistent with a Fermi liquid. At low temperatures, the Seebeck coefficient\ndeviates from the linear temperature dependence for those electron liquids that\nexhibit a correlation-induced pseudogap, indicating a change in the energy\ndependence of the scattering rate. The implications for describing transport in\nstrongly correlated materials are discussed.\n", "  We consider the construction of pseudospin bases for a time-reversal and\ninversion symmetric system, illustrated by a model for Cu:Bi$_2$Se$_3$.\nDifferent methods and bases are compared.\n", "  Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the European Space\nAgency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a\nstudy in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a\ndirect-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by\nEuropean industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data\nprocessing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis\nConsortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013\nand arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the\nSun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft\nand payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission\nstarted with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently\ntransferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia\nand give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016)\nbeing operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload\nmodule, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific\nperformance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning\nactivities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational\nmode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit\noperations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data\ncan be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia\nhome page at http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia.\n", "  We study the effects of the effective range of interaction on the eigenvalues\nand eigenstates of two particles confined in a three-dimensional (3D) isotropic\nas well as one- or quasi-one dimensional harmonic (1D) traps. For this we\nemploy model potentials which mimic finite-range s-wave interactions over a\nwide range of s-wave scattering length $a_s$ including the unitarity limits\n$a_s \\rightarrow \\pm\\infty$. Our results show that when the range is larger\nthan the 3D or 1D harmonic oscillator length scale, the eigenvalues and\neigenstates are nearly similar to those of noninteracting two particles in the\n3D or 1D trap, respectively. In case of 3D, we find that when the range goes to\nzero, the results of contact potential as derived by Busch {\\it et al.}\n[Foundations of Physics, {\\bf28}, 549 (1998)] are reproduced. However, in the\ncase of 1D, such reproducibility does not occur as the range goes to zero. We\nhave calculated the eigenvalues and eigenstates in 1D harmonic trap taking\none-dimensional finite- range model potential. We have also calculated bound\nstate properties of two particles confined in a highly anisotropic quasi-1D\ntrap taking three-dimensional finite-range model potential, and examined\nwhether these quasi-1D results approach towards 1D ones as the aspect ratio\n$\\eta$ of the radial to axial frequency of the trap increases. We find that if\nthe range is very small compared to the axial size of the trap, then one can\nreach 1D regime for $\\eta \\ge 10000$. However, for large range, one can nearly\nget 1D results for smaller values of $\\eta$. This study will be important for\nexploration of two-body or many body physics of trapped ultracold atoms\ninteracting with narrow Feshbach resonance for which the effective range can be\nlarge.\n", "  We investigate steady-state properties of a two-dimensional incoherent-pumped\ndissipative Bose-Hubbard model, which describes a photon square lattice. This\nincoherent pumping exhibits an important environment-induced higher-order\nfluctuation effect, which induces a strong competition between the\ndriven-dissipative channel, the photon-photon interaction, and the photon\nhopping in multi-photon processes. This new competition gives rise to a\nspontaneous breaking of the U(1) symmetry of system. As a result, we predict a\nmany-body steady-state localized-delocalized phase transition and an\nanti-blockade effect, in which the increasing of the repulsive photon-photon\ninteraction promotes the emergence of phase transition. These unconventional\nmany-body steady-state phenomena can be understood by analyzing the\nsingle-cavity properties. Our results pave a new way to control many-body\ndynamics of driven-dissipative systems.\n", "  Cluster concepts have been extremely useful in elucidating many problems in\nphysics. Percolation theory provides a generic framework to study the behavior\nof the cluster distribution. In most cases the theory predicts a geometrical\ntransition at the percolation threshold, characterized in the percolative phase\nby the presence of a spanning cluster, which becomes infinite in the\nthermodynamic limit. Standard percolation usually deals with the problem when\nthe constitutive elements of the clusters are randomly distributed. However\ncorrelations cannot always be neglected. In this case correlated percolation is\nthe appropriate theory to study such systems. The origin of correlated\npercolation could be dated back to 1937 when Mayer [1] proposed a theory to\ndescribe the condensation from a gas to a liquid in terms of mathematical\nclusters (for a review of cluster theory in simple fluids see [2]). The\nlocation for the divergence of the size of these clusters was interpreted as\nthe condensation transition from a gas to a liquid. One of the major drawback\nof the theory was that the cluster number for some values of thermodynamic\nparameters could become negative. As a consequence the clusters did not have\nany physical interpretation [3]. This theory was followed by Frenkel's\nphenomenological model [4], in which the fluid was considered as made of non\ninteracting physical clusters with a given free energy. This model was later\nimproved by Fisher [3], who proposed a different free energy for the clusters,\nnow called droplets, and consequently a different scaling form for the droplet\nsize distribution. This distribution, which depends on two geometrical\nparameters, has the nice feature that the mean droplet size exhibits a\ndivergence at the liquid-gas critical point.\n", "  We introduce a new quantity to petrology, the Shannon entropy, as a tool for\nquantifying mixing as well as the rate of production of hybrid compositions in\nthe mixing system. The Shannon entropy approach is applied to time series\nnumerical simulations and high-temperature experiments performed with natural\nmelts. We note that in both cases the Shannon entropy increases linearly during\nthe initial stages of mixing and then saturates toward constant values.\nFurthermore, chemical elements with different mobilities display different\nrates of increase of the Shannon entropy. This indicates that the hybrid\ncomposition for the different elements is attained at different times\ngenerating a wide range of spatio-compositional domains which further increase\nthe apparent complexity of the mixing process. Results from the application of\nthe Shannon entropy analysis are compared with the concept of Relaxation of\nConcentration Variance (RCV), a measure recently introduced in petrology to\nquantify chemical exchanges during magma mixing. We derive a linear expression\nrelating the change of concentration variance during mixing and the Shannon\nentropy. We show that the combined use of Shannon entropy and RCV provides the\nmost complete information about the space and time complexity of magma mixing.\nAs a consequence, detailed information about this fundamental petrogenetic and\nvolcanic process can be gathered. In particular, the Shannon entropy can be\nused as complement to the RCV method to quantify the mobility of chemical\nelements in magma mixing systems, to obtain information about the rate of\nproduction of compositional heterogeneities, and to derive empirical\nrelationships linking the rate of chemical exchanges between interacting magmas\nand mixing time.\n", "  Graphene grown by chemical vapour deposition is transferred on top of flat\ngold nanoislands and characterized by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and\natomic force microscopy (AFM). Graphene bubbles are formed with lateral\ndimensions determined by the size and shape of nanoislands. These graphene\nbubbles can be squeezed during STM imaging using bias voltages of less than 250\nmV and tunnelling currents of 1 nA. Similarly, the graphene suspended over gold\nnanovoids is deflected 4 - 5 nm by the STM tip when imaging at low bias\nvoltages (U = 30 mV). Nanoindentation measurements performed by AFM show that\nthe squeezing of graphene bubbles occurs at repulsive forces of 20 - 35 nN, and\nsuch forces can result in deflections of several nanometres in suspended\ngraphene parts, respectively. Comparing the AFM and STM results, this study\nreveals that mechanical forces of the order of 10e-8 N occur between the STM\ntip and graphene under ambient imaging conditions and typical tunnelling\nparameters.\n", "  At about 1000 days after the launch of Gaia we present the first Gaia data\nrelease, Gaia DR1, consisting of astrometry and photometry for over 1 billion\nsources brighter than magnitude 20.7. We summarize Gaia DR1 and provide\nillustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion\nof the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. Gaia DR1\nconsists of: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions,\nparallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars\nin common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues and a secondary astrometric\ndata set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The\nsecond component is the photometric data set,consisting of mean G-band\nmagnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of\n~3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south\necliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set\nthe typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and\nabout 1 mas/yr for the proper motions. A systematic component of ~0.3 mas\nshould be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of ~94000\nHipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more\nprecise at about 0.06 mas/yr. For the secondary astrometric data set, the\ntypical uncertainty of the positions is ~10 mas. The median uncertainties on\nthe mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to ~0.03 mag over the\nmagnitude range 5 to 20.7. Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping\nof the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin\nobservational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this\nfirst Gaia data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the\ndata quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions\nfrom the data.\n", "  We report the inelastic light scattering studies on SmFeAsO0.65 and\nSmFeAsO0.77H0.12 with iron isotopes namely 54Fe and 57Fe. In both of these\nsystems under investigation we observed a significant shift in the frequency of\nthe phonon modes associated with the displacement of Fe atoms around ~ 200\ncm-1. The observed shift in the Fe mode (B1g) for SmFeAsO0.65 is ~ 1.4 % and\nlower in case of SmFeAsO0.77H0.12, which is ~ 0.65 %, attributed to the lower\npercentage of isotopic substitution in case of SmFeAsO0.77H0.12. Our study\nreveals the significant iron isotope effect in these systems hinting towards\nthe crucial role of electron-phonon coupling in the pairing mechanism of iron\nbased superconductors.\n", "  Simple analytic expressions for the polarizability of metallic nanoparticles\nare in wide use in the field of plasmonics, but their origins are not obvious.\nIn this article, expressions for the polarizability of a particle are derived\nin the quasistatic limit in a manner that allows the physical origin of the\nterms to be clearly seen. The discussion is tutorial in nature, with particular\nattention given to the role of particle shape since this is a controlling\nfactor in particle plasmon resonances.\n", "  In this work we present a scenario in which a nonstandard interaction in\nneutrino propagation can explain the three major tensions in the neutrino\noscillation data at present. These tensions are: (i) a non-zero best-fit value\nof the non-standard oscillation parameters in the the global analysis of the\nsolar and KamLAND data which rules out the standard oscillation scenario at\n$90\\%$ C.L, (ii) the measurement of the non-maximal value of $\\theta_{23}$ by\nNO$\\nu$A which excludes the maximal mixing at $2.5 \\sigma$ C.L. and (iii) a\ndiscrepancy in the $\\theta_{13}$ measurement by T2K which has a tension with\nthe reactor best-fit value of $\\sin^2\\theta_{13}=0.021$ at $90\\%$ C.L. Our\nresults show that all these three above mentioned anomalies can be explained if\none assumes the existence of the non-standard interactions in neutrino\npropagation with $\\theta_{23}=45^\\circ$ and $\\sin^2\\theta_{13}=0.021$ in the\ncase of normal hierarchy. In our scenario the phase of $\\epsilon_{e\\tau}$ is\nzero and the most favorable value of the Dirac CP phase is approximately\n$255^\\circ$.\n", "  The Amsterdam-ASTRON Radio Transients Facility And Analysis Center (AARTFAAC)\nall sky monitor is a sensitive, real time transient detector based on the Low\nFrequency Array (LOFAR). It generates images of the low frequency radio sky\nwith spatial resolution of 10s of arcmin, MHz bandwidths, and a time cadence of\na few seconds, while simultaneously but independently observing with LOFAR. The\nimage timeseries is then monitored for short and bright radio transients. On\ndetection of a transient, a low latency trigger will be generated for LOFAR,\nwhich can interrupt its schedule to carry out follow-up observations of the\ntrigger location at high sensitivity and resolutions. In this paper, we\ndescribe our heterogeneous, hierarchical design to manage the 240 Gbps raw data\nrate, and large scale computing to produce real-time images with minimum\nlatency. We discuss the implementation of the instrumentation, its performance,\nand scalability.\n", "  We present new spectroscopic observations obtained with GMOS@Gemini-S of a\nsample of 25 hii regions located in NGC 55, a late-type galaxy in the nearby\nSculptor group. We derive physical conditions and chemical composition through\nthe te-method for 18 hii regions, and strong-line abundances for 22 hii\nregions. We provide abundances of He, O, N, Ne, S, Ar, finding a substantially\nhomogenous composition in the ionised gas of the disc of NGC 55, with no trace\nof radial gradients. The oxygen abundances, both derived with \\te- and\nstrong-line methods, have similar mean values and similarly small dispersion:\n12+$\\log$(O/H)=8.13$\\pm$0.18~dex with the former and\n12+$\\log$(O/H)=8.17$\\pm$0.13~dex with the latter. The average metallicities and\nthe flat gradients agree with previous studies of smaller samples of \\hii\\\nregions and there is a qualitative agreement with the blue supergiant radial\ngradient as well. We investigate the origin of such flat gradients comparing\nNGC 55 with NGC 300, its companion galaxy, which is also twin of NGC 55 in\nterms of mass and luminosity. We suggest that the differences in the metal\ndistributions in the two galaxies might be related to the differences in their\nK-band surface density profile. The flatter profile of NGC 55 probably causes\nin this galaxy higher infall/outflow rates than in similar galaxies. This\nlikely provokes a strong mixing of gas and a re-distribution of metals.\n", "  In searching for novel photoactive liquid crystals, we have synthesized a\nseries of five-ring pyridine-based bent-core compounds bearing different\nsubstituents at the peripheral phenyl rings (CH3O, Cl and NO2). Their\nmesomorphic behaviour has been investigated by polarizing optical microscopy,\ndifferential scanning calorimetry and X-ray scattering, and then compared with\nthe unsubstituted parent compound. The introduction of the methoxy groups at\nthe peripheral phenyl rings of the bent core results in a non-mesomorphic\ncompound, whereas the chloro- and nitro-substituted compounds form\nenantiotropic B1-like phases. Significant changes of the textures and\ntransition temperatures of the mesophase have been observed under UV light. The\npresented investigation of the mesomorphic properties of the synthesized\ncompounds, coupled with analysis of the molecular packing of the related\nthree-ring compounds, will help to design self-organized molecules suitable for\nUV indicators.\n", "  The effect of superposed dc and ac applied voltages on two types of spatially\nperiodic instabilities in nematic liquid crystals, flexoelectric domains (FD)\nand electroconvection (EC), was studied. The onset characteristics, threshold\nvoltages and critical wave vectors, were determined. We found that in general\nthe superposition of driving with different time symmetries inhibits the\npattern forming mechanisms for FD and EC as well. As a consequence the onset\nextends to much higher voltages than the individual dc or ac thresholds. A dc\nbias induced reduction of the crossover frequency from the conductive to the\ndielectric EC regimes and a peculiar transition between two types of\nflexodomains with different wavelengths were detected. Direct measurements of\nthe change of the electrical conductivity and its anisotropy, induced by the\napplied dc voltage component, showed that the dc bias substantially affects\nboth parameters. Taking into account the experimentally detected variations of\nthe conductivity in the linear stability analysis of the underlying\nnemato-hydrodynamic equations, a qualitative agreement with the experimental\nfindings on the onset behavior of spatially periodic instabilities was\nobtained.\n", "  There is at present no theory that can explain the curious properties of ball\nlightning. This suggests that we may not be using the most appropriate\nconcepts. The concept of a 'parallel space' may point the way to a valid\ntheory.\n", "  The European Space Agency's Gaia satellite was launched into orbit around L2\nin December 2013 with a payload containing 106 large-format scientific CCDs.\nThe primary goal of the mission is to repeatedly obtain high-precision\nastrometric and photometric measurements of one thousand million stars over the\ncourse of five years. The scientific value of the down-linked data, and the\noperation of the onboard autonomous detection chain, relies on the high\nperformance of the detectors. As Gaia slowly rotates and scans the sky, the\nCCDs are continuously operated in a mode where the line clock rate and the\nsatellite rotation spin-rate are in synchronisation. Nominal mission operations\nbegan in July 2014 and the first data release is being prepared for release at\nthe end of Summer 2016.\n  In this paper we present an overview of the focal plane, the detector system,\nand strategies for on-orbit performance monitoring of the system. This is\nfollowed by a presentation of the performance results based on analysis of data\nacquired during a two-year window beginning at payload switch-on. Results for\nparameters such as readout noise and electronic offset behaviour are presented\nand we pay particular attention to the effects of the L2 radiation environment\non the devices. The radiation-induced degradation in the charge transfer\nefficiency (CTE) in the (parallel) scan direction is clearly diagnosed;\nhowever, an extrapolation shows that charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) effects\nat end of mission will be approximately an order of magnitude less than\npredicted pre-flight. It is shown that the CTI in the serial register\n(horizontal direction) is still dominated by the traps inherent to the\nmanufacturing process and that the radiation-induced degradation so far is only\na few per cent. Finally, we summarise some of the detector effects discovered\non-orbit which are still being investigated.\n", "  The author's attempt to construct a local causal model of quantum theory (QT)\nthat includes quantum field theory (QFT) resulted in the identification of\n\"quantum objects\" as the elementary units of causality and locality. Quantum\nobjects are collections of particles (including single particles) whose\ncollective dynamics and measurement results can only be described by the laws\nof QT and QFT. Local causal models of quantum objects' internal dynamics are\nnot possible if a locality is understood as a space-point locality. Within\nquantum objects, state transitions may occur which instantly affect the whole\nquantum object. The identification of quantum objects as the elementary units\nof causality and locality has two primary implications for a causal model of\nquantum objects: (1) quantum objects run autonomously with system-state update\nfrequencies based on their local proper times and with either no or minimal\ndependency on external parameters. (2) The laws of physics that describe global\n(but relativistic) interrelationships must be translated to a causal model of\ninteractions between quantum objects and interactions between quantum objects\nand the space.\n", "  A range of seven different Ag plasmonic arrays formed using nanostructures of\nvarying shape, size and gap were fabricated using helium-ion lithography (HIL)\non an InGaN/GaN quantum well (QW) substrate. The influence of the array\ngeometry on plasmon-enhanced F\\\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from a\nsingle InGaN QW to a ~ 80 nm layer of CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) embedded in a\npoly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix is investigated. It is shown that the\nenergy transfer efficiency is strongly dependent on the array properties and an\nefficiency of ~ 51% is observed for a nanoring array. There were no signatures\nof FRET in the absence of the arrays. The QD acceptor layer emission is highly\nsensitive to the array geometry. A model was developed to confirm that the\nincrease in the QD emission on the QW substrate compared with a GaN substrate\ncan be attributed solely to plasmon-enhanced FRET. The individual contributions\nof direct enhancement of the QD layer emission by the array and the\nplasmon-enhanced FRET are separated out, with the QD emission described by the\nproduct of an array emission factor and an energy transfer factor. It is shown\nthat while the nanoring geometry results in an energy transfer factor of ~ 1.7\nthe competing quenching by the array, with an array emission factor of ~ 0.7,\nresults in only an overall gain of ~ 14% in the QD emission. The QD emission\nwas enhanced by ~ 71% for a nanobox array, resulting from the combination of a\nmore modest energy transfer factor of 1.2 coupled with an array emission factor\nof ~ 1.4.\n", "  To have a closed system, the Maxwell equations should be supplemented by\nconstitutive relations which connect the primary electromagnetic fields\n$(\\bE,\\bB)$ with the secondary ones $(\\bD,\\bH)$ induced in a medium. Recently\n[Opt. Commun. \\textbf{354}, 259 (2015)] the allowed shapes of the constitutive\nrelations that follow from the relativistic Maxwell equations formulated in\nterms of geometric algebra were constructed by author. In this paper the\nobtained general relativistic relations between $(\\bD,\\bH)$ and $(\\bE,\\bB)$\nfields are transformed to four $6\\times 6$ matrices that are universal in\nconstructing various combinations of constitutive relations in terms of more\npopular Gibbs-Heaviside vectorial calculus frequently used to investigate the\nelectromagnetic wave propagation in anisotropic, birefringent, bianisotropic,\nchiral etc media.\n", "  The first data release from the Gaia mission contains accurate positions and\nmagnitudes for more than a billion sources, and proper motions and parallaxes\nfor the majority of the 2.5~million Hipparcos and Tycho-2 stars.\n  We describe three essential elements of the initial data treatment leading to\nthis catalogue: the image analysis, the construction of a source list, and the\nnear real-time monitoring of the payload health. We also discuss some weak\npoints that set limitations for the attainable precision at the present stage\nof the mission.\n  Image parameters for point sources are derived from one-dimensional scans,\nusing a maximum likelihood method, under the assumption of a line spread\nfunction constant in time, and a complete modelling of bias and background.\nThese conditions are, however, not completely fulfilled. The Gaia source list\nis built starting from a large ground-based catalogue, but even so a\nsignificant number of new entries have been added, and a large number have been\nremoved. The autonomous onboard star image detection will pick up many spurious\nimages, especially around bright sources, and such unwanted detections must be\nidentified. Another key step of the source list creation consists in arranging\nthe more than $10^{10}$ individual detections in spatially isolated groups that\ncan be analysed individually.\n  Complete software systems have been built for the Gaia initial data\ntreatment, that manage approximately 50~million focal plane transits daily,\ngiving transit times and fluxes for 500~million individual CCD images to the\nastrometric and photometric processing chains. The software also carries out a\nsuccessful and detailed daily monitoring of Gaia health.\n", "  Human dynamics and sociophysics suggest statistical models that may explain\nand provide us with a better understanding of social phenomena. Here we propose\na generative multiplicative decrease model that gives rise to a rank-order\ndistribution and allows us to analyse the results of the last three UK\nparliamentary elections. We provide empirical evidence that the additive\nWeibull distribution, which can be generated from our model, is a close fit to\nthe electoral data, offering a novel interpretation of the recent election\nresults.\n", "  For detection of neutrinos from galactic supernovae, the planned\nHyper-Kamiokande detector will be the first detector that delivers both a high\nevent rate (about one third of the IceCube rate) and event-by-event energy\ninformation. In this thesis, we use a three-dimensional computer simulation by\nthe Garching group to find out whether this additional information can be used\nto improve the detection prospects of fast time variations in the neutrino\nflux.\n  We find that the amplitude of SASI oscillations of the neutrino number flux\nis energy-dependent. However, in this simulation, the larger amplitude in some\nenergy bins is not sufficient to counteract the increased noise caused by the\nlower event rate. Finally, we derive a condition describing when it is\nadvantageous to consider an energy bin instead of the total signal and show\nthat this condition is satisfied if the oscillation of the mean neutrino energy\nis increased slightly.\n", "  We present a schlieren system comprised of 3D printed optical mounts, a\nsub-$10 mirror, and a smartphone camera. The system is intended to make\nschlieren imaging accessible to K-through-12 students, educators, as well as\nhobbyists. In the manuscript, we detail the design of the system, provide\nsource files for continued iteration, and show some example schlieren images\nand videos of a butane lighter, a jet of compressed air, and an electric stove.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate a Brownian motion (BM) with purely time\ndependent drift and difusion by suggesting and examining several Brownian\nfunctionals which characterize the lifetime and reactivity of such stochastic\nprocesses. We introduce several probability distribution functions (PDFs)\nassociated with such time dependent BMs. For instance, for a BM with initial\nstarting point $x_0$, we derive analytical expressions for : (i) the PDF\n$P(t_f|x_0)$ of the first passage time $t_f$ which specify the lifetime of such\nstochastic process, (ii) the PDF $P(A|x_0)$ of the area A till the first\npassage time and it provides us numerous valuable information about the\neffective reactivity of the process, (iii) the PDF $P(M)$ associated with the\nmaximum size M of the BM process before the first passage time, and (iv)the\njoint PDF $P(M; t_m)$ of the maximum size M and its occurrence time $t_m$\nbefore the first passage time. These distributions are examined for the power\nlaw time time dependent drift and diffusion. A simple illustrative example for\nthe stochastic model of water resources availability in snowmelt dominated\nregions with power law time dependent drift and diffusion is demonstrated in\ndetails. We motivate our study with approximate calculation of an unsolved\nproblem of Brownian functionals including inertia.\n", "  We study the inclusive DbarD and DD pair production in proton-proton\ncollisions at the LHC at lead- ing order of the parton Reggeization approach\nendowed with universal scale-depended fragmen- tation functions for c-quark to\nD-meson and for gluon to D-meson transitions. We have described DbarD and DD\ndistributions in azimuthal angle, as well as transverse momentum, rapidity\ndistance, and invariant mass measured in the region of large rapidity 2 < y < 4\nby the LHCb Collabora- tion at the LHC without free parameters. We have used\nReggeized amplitudes for the processes RR - gg and RR - c barc which are\nobtained accordingly to Feynman rules of the L.N. Lipatov effective theory of\nReggeized partons, and Kimber-Martin-Ryskin model for unintegrated gluon\ndistribution function in a proton with Martin-Stirling-Thorne-Watt collinear\nparton distributions as inputs.\n", "  CMOS imagers are becoming increasingly popular in astronomy. A very low noise\nlevel is required to observe extremely faint targets and to get high-precision\nflux measurements. Although CMOS technology offers many advantages over CCDs, a\nmajor bottleneck is still the read noise. To move from an industrial CMOS\nsensor to one suitable for scientific applications, an improved design that\noptimizes the noise level is essential. Here, we study the 1/f and thermal\nnoise performance of the source follower (SF) of a CMOS pixel in detail. We\nidentify the relevant design parameters, and analytically study their impact on\nthe noise level using the BSIM3v3 noise model with an enhanced model of gate\ncapacitance. Our detailed analysis shows that the dependence of the 1/f noise\non the geometrical size of the source follower is not limited to minimum\nchannel length, compared to the classical approach to achieve the minimum 1/f\nnoise. We derive the optimal gate dimensions (the width and the length) of the\nsource follower that minimize the 1/f noise, and validate our results using\nnumerical simulations. By considering the thermal noise or white noise along\nwith 1/f noise, the total input noise of the source follower depends on the\ncapacitor ratio CG/CFD and the drain current (Id). Here, CG is the total gate\ncapacitance of the source follower and CFD is the total floating diffusion\ncapacitor at the input of the source follower. We demonstrate that the optimum\ngate capacitance (CG) depends on the chosen bias current but ranges from CFD/3\nto CFD to achieve the minimum total noise of the source follower. Numerical\ncalculation and circuit simulation with 180nm CMOS technology are performed to\nvalidate our results.\n", "  Graph theory provides a powerful framework to investigate brain functional\nconnectivity networks and their modular organization. However, most graph-based\nmethods suffer from a fundamental resolution limit that may have affected\nprevious studies and prevented detection of modules, or communities, that are\nsmaller than a specific scale. Surprise, a resolution-limit-free function\nrooted in discrete probability theory, has been recently introduced and applied\nto brain networks, revealing a wide size-distribution of functional modules, in\ncontrast with many previous reports. However, the use of Surprise is limited to\nbinary networks, while brain networks are intrinsically weighted, reflecting a\ncontinuous distribution of connectivity strengths between different brain\nregions. Here, we propose Asymptotical Surprise, a continuous version of\nSurprise, for the study of weighted brain connectivity networks, and validate\nthis approach in synthetic networks endowed with a ground-truth modular\nstructure. We compare Asymptotical Surprise with leading community detection\nmethods currently in use and show its superior sensitivity in the detection of\nsmall modules even in the presence of noise and intersubject variability such\nas those observed in fMRI data. Finally, we apply our novel approach to\nfunctional connectivity networks from resting state fMRI experimenta, and\ndemonstrate a heterogeneous modular organization, with a wide distribution of\nclusters spanning multiple scales.\n", "  Food webs have been found to exhibit remarkable motif profiles, patterns in\nthe relative prevalences of all possible three-species sub-graphs, and this has\nbeen related to ecosystem properties such as stability and robustness.\nAnalysing 46 food webs of various kinds, we find that most food webs fall into\none of two distinct motif families. The separation between the families is well\npredicted by a global measure of hierarchical order in directed networks -\ntrophic coherence. We find that trophic coherence is also a good predictor for\nthe extent of omnivory, defined as the tendency of species to feed on multiple\ntrophic levels. We compare our results to a network assembly model that admits\ntunable trophic coherence via a single free parameter. The model is able to\ngenerate food webs in either of the two families by varying this parameter, and\ncorrectly classifies almost all the food webs in our database. This establishes\na link between global order and local preying patterns in food webs.\n", "  We use both numerical and analytical approaches to study the dynamics of the\ngravitational collapse in the framework of the relativistic theory of\ngravitation (RTG). We use various equations of state for the collapsing matter\nand relatively realistic initial conditions with smooth matter distribution,\nwhich corresponds to static solution for the given equation of state. We also\nobtain results concerning the influence of the graviton mass on the properties\nof static solutions. We specify several characteristics of the process of the\ncollapse, in particular, we determine the dependence of the turning point time\n(when contraction is replaced by inflation) on the graviton mass. We also study\nthe influence of non-zero pressure on the dynamics of the collapse.\n", "  We present a definition of integrability for the one dimensional Schroedinger\nequation, which encompasses all known integrable systems, i.e. systems for\nwhich the spectrum can be explicitly computed. For this, we introduce the class\nof rigid functions, built as Liouvillian functions, but containing all\nsolutions of rigid differential operators in the sense of Katz, and a notion of\nnatural boundary conditions. We then make a complete classification of rational\nintegrable potentials. Many new integrable cases are found, some of them\nphysically interesting.\n", "  In this paper, the Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) proposed by Pinelli is\nimplemented for finite volume approximations of incompressible Navier-Stokes\nequations solutions in the open source toolbox OpenFOAM version 2.2. Solid\nobstacles are described using a discrete forcing approach for boundary\nconditions. Unlike traditional approaches encompassing the presence of a solid\nbody using conformal meshes and imposing no-slip boundary conditions on the\nboundary faces of the mesh, the solid body is here represented on the Eulerian\nCartesian mesh through an ad-hoc body force evaluated on a set of Lagrangian\nmarkers. The markers can move across the Eulerian mesh, hence allowing for a\nstraightforward analysis of motion or deformation of the body. The IBM method\nis described and implemented in PisoFOAM, whose Pressure-Implicit\nSplit-Operator (PISO) solver is modified accordingly. The presence of the solid\nbody and the divergence-free of the fluid velocity are imposed simultaneously\nby sub-iterating between IBM and the pressure correction step. This scheme\nallows for the use of fast optimized Poisson solvers while granting excellent\naccuracy with respect to the previously mentioned constraints. Various 2D and\n3D well-documented test cases of flows around fixed or moving circular\ncylinders are simulated and carefully validated against existing data from the\nliterature. The capability of the new solver is discussed in terms of accuracy\nand numerical performances.\n", "  Previous studies have shown that Twitter users have biases to tweet from\ncertain locations, locational bias, and during certain hours, temporal bias. We\nused three years of geolocated Twitter Data to quantify these biases and test\nour central hypothesis that Twitter users biases are consistent across US\ncities. Our results suggest that temporal and locational bias of Twitter users\nare inconsistent between three US metropolitan cities. We derive conclusions\nabout the role of the complexity of the underlying data producing process on\nits consistency and argue for the potential research avenue for Geospatial Data\nScience to test and quantify these inconsistencies in the class of organically\nevolved Big Data.\n", "  The focus of these lectures is the Gopakumar-Vafa's insight that ``Large N\ndualities'' (relating gauge theories and closed strings) are realized, in\ncertain cases, by \"transition in geometry\". In their pivotal 1998 example, the\ngauge theory is SU(N) Chern-Simons theory on S^3, for large N, and the\ntransition is the \"conifold\" transition between two Calabi--Yau varieties. Much\nprogress has been made to support Gopakumar and Vafa's conjecture, including\nthe lift of the transition to a transformation between 7-manifolds with G_2\nholonomy. In another direction, this set up brings us to consider the uncharted\nterritory of \"open Gromov-Witten invariants\". The lectures, hence the notes,\nwere prepared for an audience of beginning graduate students, in mathematics\nand physics, whom we hope to get interested in this subject. Because most of\nthe material presented in these lectures comes from the physics literature, we\naimed to build a bridge for the mathematicians towards the physics papers on\nthe subject.\n"]}
