We first\nsimplify the Dirac equation by semiclassical approximation, and then a\nsemiclassical Hamilton-Jacobi equation is obtained. Using the Hamilton-Jacobi\nequation, we study the Hawking temperature and fermions tunneling rate at the\nevent horizon of the higher-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m black hole\nspacetime. Finally, the correct entropy is calculation by the method beyond\nsemiclassical approximation.\n", "  In the high-temperature phase of QCD, the heavy quark momentum diffusion\nconstant determines, via a fluctuation-dissipation relation, how fast a heavy\nquark kinetically equilibrates. This transport coefficient can be extracted\nfrom thermal correlators via a Kubo formula. We present a lattice calculation\nof the relevant Euclidean correlators in the gluon plasma, based on a recent\nformulation of the problem in heavy-quark effective field theory (HQET). We\nfind a $\\approx20%$ enhancement of the Euclidean correlator at maximal time\nseparation as the temperature is lowered from $6T_c$ to $2T_c$, pointing to\nstronger interactions at lower temperatures. At the same time, the correlator\nbecomes flatter from $6T_c$ down to $2T_c$, indicating a relative shift of the\nspectral weight to lower frequencies. A recent next-to-leading order\nperturbative calculation of the correlator agrees with the time dependence of\nthe lattice data at the few-percent level. We estimate how much additional\ncontribution from the $\\omega\\lesssim T$ region of the perturbative spectral\nfunction would be required to bring it in agreement with the lattice data at\n$3.1T_c$.\n", "  We propose a Goldstino model formulated in terms of a constrained complex\nlinear superfield. Its comparison to other Goldstino models is given. Couplings\nto supersymmetric matter and supergravity are briefly described.\n", "  We report on the observation of magnetic quantum ratchet effect in\nmetal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistors on silicon surface\n(Si-MOSFETs). We show that the excitation of an unbiased transistor by ac\nelectric field of terahertz radiation at normal incidence leads to a direct\nelectric current between the source and drain contacts if the transistor is\nsubjected to an in-plane magnetic field. The current rises linearly with the\nmagnetic field strength and quadratically with the ac electric field amplitude.\nIt depends on the polarization state of the ac field and can be induced by both\nlinearly and circularly polarized radiation. We present the quasi-classical and\nquantum theories of the observed effect and show that the current originates\nfrom the Lorentz force acting upon carriers in asymmetric inversion channels of\nthe transistors.\n", "  We describe the fine structure of Dirac states in HgTe/CdHgTe quantum wells\nof critical and close-to-critical thickness and demonstrate the formation of an\nanticrossing gap between the tips of the Dirac cones driven by interface\ninversion asymmetry. By combining symmetry analysis, atomistic calculations,\nand k-p theory with interface terms, we obtain a quantitative description of\nthe energy spectrum and extract the interface mixing coefficient. The\nzero-magnetic-field splitting of Dirac cones can be experimentally revealed in\nstudying magnetotransport phenomena, cyclotron resonance, Raman scattering, or\nTHz radiation absorption.\n", "  Noncentrosymmetric superconductors (NCSs) with broken inversion symmetry can\nhave spin-dependent order parameters (OPs) with mixed parity which can also\nhave nodes in the pair potential as well as the energy spectra. These nodes are\ndistinct features that are not present in conventional superconductors. They\nappear as points or lines in the momentum space where the latter can have\nangular or radial geometries dictated by the dimensionality, the lattice\nstructure and the pairing interaction.\n  In this work we study the nodes in time reversal symmetry (TRS) preserving\nNCSs at the OP, the pair potential, and the energy spectrum levels. Nodes are\nexamined by using spin independent pairing interactions respecting the\nrotational $C_{\\infty v}$ symmetry in the presence of spin-orbit coupling\n(SOC). The pairing symmetries and the nodal topology are affected by the\nrelative strength of the pairing channels which is studied for the mixed\nsinglet-triplet, pure singlet, and pure triplet. Complementary to the angular\nline nodes widely present in the literature, the $C_{\\infty v}$ symmetry here\nallows radial line nodes (RLNs) due to the nonlinear momentum dependence in the\nOPs. The topology of the RLNs in the mixed case shows a distinctly different\ncharacterization than the half-spin quantum vortex at the Dirac point. We apply\nthis NCS physics to the inversion symmetry broken exciton condensates (ECs) in\ndouble quantum wells where the point and the RLNs can be found. On the other\nhand, for a pure triplet condensate, two fully gapped and topologically\ndistinct regimes exist, separated by a QSHI-like zero energy superconducting\nstate with even number of Majorana modes. We also remark on how the point and\nthe RLNs can be manipulated, enabling an external control on the\ntopology.tions.\n", "  The flatness of the inflaton potential and lightness of the Higgs could have\nthe common origin of the breaking of a global symmetry. This scenario provides\na unified framework of Goldstone Inflation and Composite Higgs, where the\ninflaton and the Higgs both have a pseudo--Goldstone boson nature. The inflaton\nreheats the Universe via decays to the Higgs and subsequent secondary\nproduction of other SM particles via the top and massive vector bosons. We find\nthat inflationary predictions and perturbative reheating conditions are\nconsistent with CMB data for sub--Planckian values of the fields, as well as\nopening up the possibility of inflation at the TeV scale. We explore this\nexciting possibility, leading to an interplay between collider data and\ncosmological constraints.\n", "  The large-scale magnetic fields we observe today in galaxies and galaxy\nclusters could be the result of a pure quantum effect taking place during\ninflation, to wit, the creation of particles (photons) out from the vacuum in a\ncurved spacetime. We show that, whenever the conformal invariance of\nelectromagnetism is broken during inflation, the actual magnetic field\nspectrum, in the classical limit, is given by $B_k \\simeq k^2\n\\sqrt{n_{\\mathbf{k}} }$, where $n_{\\mathbf{k}} \\gg 1$ is the number of created\nphotons with wavenumber $k$. In particular, a scale-invariant magnetic field of\norder of $10^{12}$G can emerge in the simplest model of cosmic magnetogenesis,\nthe one where the inflaton is kinetically coupled to the photon. Moreover, and\ncontrarily to the general belief, we show that such a model is free from the\nso-called strong-coupling and backreaction problems. This conclusion follows,\nindirectly, from the observation that post-inflationary electric currents,\nwhich in the literature are incorrectly supposed to freeze superhorizon\nmagnetic fields after inflation, are indeed vanishing on superhorizon scales\ndue to causality.\n", "  The study of electron transport and scattering processes limiting electron\nmobility in high-quality semiconductor structures is central to solid-state\nelectronics. Here, we uncover an unavoidable source of electron scattering\nwhich is caused by fluctuations of nuclear spins. We calculate the momentum\nrelaxation time of electrons in quantum wells governed by the hyperfine\ninteraction between electrons and nuclei and show that this time drastically\ndepends on the spatial correlation of nuclear spins. Moreover, the scattering\nprocesses accompanied by a spin flip are a source of the backscattering of\nDirac fermions at conducting surfaces of topological insulators.\n", "  We extend the idea of a discrete-time quantum walk on a graph by placing a\nqubit on each vertex, and allowing the walker to interact with the qubit at its\ncurrent position. We show that allowing for a controlled-Z interaction at each\ntime step between the walker and the vertex qubits generates multipartite\nentanglement between the qubits. We demonstrate that for particular coin\noperators the system generates a highly entangled cluster state, of use in\nmeasurement based quantum computation.\n", "  Several proposals to produce {\\it tripartite} $W$-type entanglement are\nprobabilistic even if no imperfections are considered in the processes. We\nprovide a deterministic way to remotely create $W$ states out of an EPR source.\nThe proposal is made viable through measurements (which can be demolitive) in\nan appropriate three-qubit basis. The protocol becomes probabilistic only when\nsource flaws are considered. It turns out that, even in this situation, it is\nrobust against imperfections in two senses: (i) It is possible, after\npostselection, to create a pure ensemble of $W$ states out of an EPR source\ncontaining a systematic error; (ii) If no postselection is done, the resulting\nmixed state has a fidelity, with respect to a pure $|W\\rangle$, which is higher\nthan that of the imperfect source in comparison to an ideal EPR source. This\nsimultaneously amounts to entanglement concentration and {\\it lifting}.\n", "  Explicit Robinson--Trautman solutions with electromagnetic field satisfying\nnonlinear field equations are derived and analyzed. The solutions are generated\nfrom the spherically symmetric ones. In all cases the electromagnetic field\nsingularity is removed while the gravitational one persists. The models\nresolving curvature singularity were not possible to generalize to\nRobinson--Trautman geometry indicating that the removal of singularity in\nassociated spherically symmetric case is just a consequence of high symmetry.\nWe show that the solutions are generally of algebraic type II but reduce to\ntype D in spherical symmetry. Asymptotically they tend to the spherically\nsymmetric case as well.\n", "  We present the public data release of halo and galaxy catalogues extracted\nfrom the EAGLE suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy\nformation. These simulations were performed with an enhanced version of the\nGADGET code that includes a modified hydrodynamics solver, time-step limiter\nand subgrid treatments of baryonic physics, such as stellar mass loss,\nelement-by-element radiative cooling, star formation and feedback from star\nformation and black hole accretion. The simulation suite includes runs\nperformed in volumes ranging from 25 to 100 comoving megaparsecs per side, with\nnumerical resolution chosen to marginally resolve the Jeans mass of the gas at\nthe star formation threshold. The free parameters of the subgrid models for\nfeedback are calibrated to the redshift z=0 galaxy stellar mass function,\ngalaxy sizes and black hole mass - stellar mass relation. The simulations have\nbeen shown to match a wide range of observations for present-day and\nhigher-redshift galaxies. The raw particle data have been used to link galaxies\nacross redshifts by creating merger trees. The indexing of the tree produces a\nsimple way to connect a galaxy at one redshift to its progenitors at higher\nredshift and to identify its descendants at lower redshift. In this paper we\npresent a relational database which we are making available for general use. A\nlarge number of properties of haloes and galaxies and their merger trees are\nstored in the database, including stellar masses, star formation rates,\nmetallicities, photometric measurements and mock gri images. Complex queries\ncan be created to explore the evolution of more than 10^5 galaxies, examples of\nwhich are provided in appendix. (abridged)\n", "  Random projections have proven extremely useful in many signal processing and\nmachine learning applications. However, they often require either to store a\nvery large random matrix, or to use a different, structured matrix to reduce\nthe computational and memory costs. Here, we overcome this difficulty by\nproposing an analog, optical device, that performs the random projections\nliterally at the speed of light without having to store any matrix in memory.\nThis is achieved using the physical properties of multiple coherent scattering\nof coherent light in random media. We use this device on a simple task of\nclassification with a kernel machine, and we show that, on the MNIST database,\nthe experimental results closely match the theoretical performance of the\ncorresponding kernel. This framework can help make kernel methods practical for\napplications that have large training sets and/or require real-time prediction.\nWe discuss possible extensions of the method in terms of a class of kernels,\nspeed, memory consumption and different problems.\n", "  Building on the recent progress in solving Chern-Simons-matter theories in\nthe planar limit, we compute the scaling dimensions of a large class of\ndisorder (\"monopole\") operators in $U(N)_k$ Chern-Simons-fermion theories at\nall 't Hooft couplings $\\lambda = N/k$. We find that the lowest-dimension\noperator of this sort has dimension $\\frac23 k^{3/2}$. We comment on the\nimplications of these results to analyzing maps of fermionic disorder operators\nunder 3D bosonization.\n", "  If leptons do not couple directly to the one Higgs doublet of the standard\nmodel of particle interactions, they must still do so somehow indirectly to\nacquire mass, as proposed recently in several models where it happens in one\nloop through dark matter. We analyze the important consequences of this\nscenario in a specific model, including Higgs decay, muon anomalous magnetic\nmoment, $\\mu \\to e \\gamma$, $\\mu \\to eee$, and the proposed dark sector.\n", "  In this paper, using the localization technique we analyze the large N limit\nof the mass deformed Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena (ABJM) theory on the\nthree sphere with a finite mass parameter and finite Chern-Simons levels. We\nfind two different solutions of the saddle point equations in the large N\nlimit. With these solutions we compute the free energy and find that there is a\nfirst order phase transition. Our results may predict a phase transition in the\ndual gravity theory.\n", "  A major challenge in condensed matter physics is active control of quantum\nphases. Dynamic control with pulsed electromagnetic fields can overcome\nenergetic barriers enabling access to transient or metastable states that are\nnot thermally accessible. Here we demonstrate strain-engineered tuning of\nLa2/3Ca1/3MnO3 into an emergent charge-ordered insulating phase with extreme\nphoto-susceptibility where even a single optical pulse can initiate a\ntransition to a long-lived metastable hidden metallic phase. Comprehensive\nsingle-shot pulsed excitation measurements demonstrate that the transition is\ncooperative and ultrafast, requiring a critical absorbed photon density to\nactivate local charge excitations that mediate magnetic-lattice coupling that,\nin turn, stabilize the metallic phase. These results reveal that strain\nengineering can tune emergent functionality towards proximal macroscopic states\nto enable dynamic ultrafast optical phase switching and control.\n", "  We report the design and experimental realization of a kind of miniaturized\ndevices for efficient unidirectional launching and shaping of surface plasmon\npolaritons (SPPs). Each device consists of an array of evenly spaced gap\nplasmon resonators with varying dimensions. Particle swarm optimization is used\nto achieve a theoretical two dimensional launching efficiency of about 51%,\nunder the normal illumination of a 5-{\\mu}m waist Gaussian beam at 780 nm. By\nmodifying the wavefront of the SPPs, unidirectional SPPs with focused, Bessel\nand Airy profiles are launched and imaged with leakage radiation microscopy.\n", "  All surface plasmon resonance (SPR) devices on single-mode optical fibers'\n(SMF) end facets, as reported up to date, are limited by severely broad and\nshallow resonance spectra. The consequent poor performance when they are used\nas refractive index sensors, together with the challenge of nanofabrication on\nfiber end facets, has prohibited the development of such devices for label-free\nbiosensing. Meanwhile, the planewave coupled, multimode fiber and fiber\nsidewall SPR counterparts are extensively employed for label-free biosensing.\nIn this paper, we report the design, fabrication and characterization of a\nplasmonic crystal cavity on a SMF end facet, which shows high performance\nlabel-free sensing capability that comes from a steep cavity resonance near the\nplasmonic bandedge. The experimental figure-of-merit is 68 RIU^-1, which is\nover twenty times improvement to previous reports. The refractive index\ndetection limit is 3.5*10^-6 RIU at 1 s integration time. We also describe a\nnovel glue-and-strip process to transfer gold nano structures onto fiber end\nfacets.\n", "  We develop the energy budget equation of the coupled\nNavier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard (NSCH) system. We use the NSCH equations to model\nthe dynamics of liquid droplets in a liquid continuum. Buoyancy effects are\naccounted for through the Boussinesq assumption. We physically interpret each\nquantity involved in the energy exchange to further insight into the model.\nHighly resolved simulations involving density-driven flows and merging of\ndroplets allow us to analyze these energy budgets. In particular, we focus on\nthe energy exchanges when droplets merge, and describe flow features relevant\nto this phenomenon. By comparing our numerical simulations to analytical\npredictions and experimental results available in the literature, we conclude\nthat modeling droplet dynamics within the framework of NSCH equations is a\nsensible approach worth further research.\n", "  The half filled Landau level is expected to be approximately particle-hole\nsymmetric, which requires an extension of the Halperin-Lee-Read (HLR) theory of\nthe compressible state observed at this filling. Recent work indicates that,\nwhen particle-hole symmetry is preserved, the composite Fermions experience a\nquantized $\\pi$-Berry phase upon winding around the composite Fermi-surface,\nanalogous to Dirac fermions at the surface of a 3D topological insulator. In\ncontrast, the effective low energy theory of the composite fermion liquid\noriginally proposed by HLR lacks particle-hole symmetry and has vanishing Berry\nphase. In this paper, we explain how thermoelectric transport measurements can\nbe used to test the Dirac nature of the composite Fermions by quantitatively\nextracting this Berry phase. First we point out that longitudinal thermopower\n(Seebeck effect) is non-vanishing due to the unusual nature of particle hole\nsymmetry in this context and is not sensitive to the Berry phase. In contrast,\nwe find that off-diagonal thermopower (Nernst effect) is directly related to\nthe topological structure of the composite Fermi surface, vanishing for zero\nBerry phase and taking its maximal value for $\\pi$ Berry phase. In contrast, in\npurely electrical transport signatures the Berry phase contributions appear as\nsmall corrections to a large background signal, making the Nernst effect a\npromising diagnostic of the Dirac nature of composite fermions.\n", "  We have calculated the intensity of electromagnetic radiation from particles\nrotating in close vicinity to a transparent dielectric plate. The radiation is\na result of quantum and thermal friction occurring during particle rotation,\nwhile the driving factor of radiation is a decrease in the kinetic energy of\nparticle. The characteristic frequency of radiation is determined by the\nangular velocity and the temperature of the plate and surrounding vacuum\nbackground. These results are challenging for experimental verification in\nfuture.\n", "  The confinement of a superconductor in a thin film changes its Fermi-level\ndensity of states and is expected to change its critical temperature $T_c$.\nPrevious calculations have reported large discontinuities of $T_c$ when the\nchemical potential coincides with a subband edge. By solving the BCS gap\nequation exactly, we show that such discontinuities are artifacts and that\n$T_c$ is a continuous function of the film thickness. We also find that $T_c$\nis reduced in thin films compared with the bulk if the confinement potential is\nlower than a critical value, while for stronger confinement $T_c$ increases\nwith decreasing film thickness, reaches a maximum, and eventually drops to\nzero. Our numerical results are supported by several exact solutions. We\nfinally interpret experimental data for ultrathin lead thin films in terms of a\nthickness-dependent effective mass.\n", "  We consider the problem of grouping items into clusters based on few random\npairwise comparisons between the items. We introduce three closely related\nalgorithms for this task: a belief propagation algorithm approximating the\nBayes optimal solution, and two spectral algorithms based on the\nnon-backtracking and Bethe Hessian operators. For the case of two symmetric\nclusters, we conjecture that these algorithms are asymptotically optimal in\nthat they detect the clusters as soon as it is information theoretically\npossible to do so. We substantiate this claim for one of the spectral\napproaches we introduce.\n", "  The implementation of holonomic quantum computation on superconducting\nquantum circuits is challenging due to the general requirement of controllable\ncomplicated coupling between multilevel systems. Here we solve this problem by\nproposing a scalable circuit QED lattice with simple realization of a universal\nset of nonadiabatic holonomic quantum gates. Compared with the existing\nproposals, we can achieve both the single and two logical qubit gates in an\ntunable and all-resonant way through a hybrid transmon-transmission-line\nencoding of the logical qubits in the decoherence-free subspaces. This distinct\nadvantage thus leads to quantum gates with very fast speeds and consequently\nvery high fidelities. Therefore, our scheme paves a promising way towards the\npractical realization of high-fidelity nonadiabatic holonomic quantum\ncomputation.\n", "  Linking classical microwave electrical circuits to the optical\ntelecommunication band is at the core of modern communication. Future quantum\ninformation networks will require coherent microwave-to-optical conversion to\nlink electronic quantum processors and memories via low-loss optical\ntelecommunication networks. Efficient conversion can be achieved with\nelectro-optical modulators operating at the single microwave photon level. In\nthe standard electro-optic modulation scheme this is impossible because both,\nup- and downconverted, sidebands are necessarily present. Here we demonstrate\ntrue single sideband up- or downconversion in a triply resonant whispering\ngallery mode resonator by explicitly addressing modes with asymmetric free\nspectral range. Compared to previous experiments, we show a three orders of\nmagnitude improvement of the electro-optical conversion efficiency reaching\n0.1% photon number conversion for a 10GHz microwave tone at 0.42mW of optical\npump power. The presented scheme is fully compatible with existing\nsuperconducting 3D circuit quantum electrodynamics technology and can be used\nfor non-classical state conversion and communication. Our conversion bandwidth\nis larger than 1MHz and not fundamentally limited.\n", "  The pyrochlore insulator Yb2Ti2O7 has attracted the attention of\nexperimentalists and theoreticians alike for about 15 years. Conflicting\nneutron diffraction data on the possible existence of magnetic Bragg\nreflections at low temperature have been published. Here we report the\nobservation of magnetic Bragg reflections by neutron powder diffraction at 60\nmK. The magnetic diffraction pattern is analyzed using representation theory.\nWe find Yb2Ti2O7 to be a splayed ferromagnet as reported for Yb2Sn2O7, a\nsibling compound with also dominating ferromagnetic interactions as inferred\nfrom the positive Curie-Weiss temperature. However, the configuration of the\nmagnetic moment components perpendicular to the easy axis is of the\nall-in--all-out type in Yb2Ti2O7 while it is two-in--two-out in Yb2Sn2O7. An\noverall experimental picture of the magnetic properties emerges.\n", "  Natural odors typically consist of many molecules at different\nconcentrations. It is unclear how the numerous odorant molecules and their\npossible mixtures are discriminated by relatively few olfactory receptors.\nUsing an information-theoretic model, we show that a receptor array is optimal\nfor this task if it achieves two possibly conflicting goals: (i) each receptor\nshould respond to half of all odors and (ii) the response of different\nreceptors should be uncorrelated when averaged over odors presented with\nnatural statistics. We use these design principles to predict statistics of the\naffinities between receptors and odorant molecules for a broad class of odor\nstatistics. We also show that optimal receptor arrays can be tuned to either\nresolve concentrations well or distinguish mixtures reliably. Finally, we use\nour results to predict properties of experimentally measured receptor arrays.\nOur work can thus be used to better understand natural olfaction and it also\nsuggests ways to improve artificial sensor arrays.\n", "  We present a fully relativistic calculation of the matter bispectrum at\nsecond order in cosmological perturbation theory assuming a Gaussian primordial\ncurvature perturbation. For the first time we perform a full numerical\nintegration of the bispectrum for both baryons and cold dark matter using the\nsecond-order Einstein-Boltzmann code, SONG. We review previous analytical\nresults and provide an improved analytic approximation for the second-order\nkernel in Poisson gauge which incorporates Newtonian nonlinear evolution,\nrelativistic initial conditions, the effect of radiation at early times and the\ncosmological constant at late times. Our improved kernel provides a percent\nlevel fit to the full numerical result at late times for most configurations,\nincluding both equilateral shapes and the squeezed limit. We show that baryon\nacoustic oscillations leave an imprint in the matter bispectrum, making a\nsignificant impact on squeezed shapes.\n", "  A search is performed for the process $pp \\to G^* \\to B_H\\bar b/\\bar B_H b\n\\to H b \\bar b \\to b\\bar bb\\bar b$, predicted in composite Higgs scenarios,\nwhere $G^*$ is a heavy colour octet vector resonance and $B_H$ a vector-like\nquark of charge $-1/3$. The data were obtained from $pp$ collisions at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\n19.5 fb$^{-1}$, recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The largest\nbackground, multijet production, is estimated using a data-driven method. No\nsignificant excess of events with respect to Standard Model predictions is\nobserved, and upper limits on the production cross section times branching\nratio are set. Comparisons to the predictions from a specific benchmark model\nare made, resulting in lower mass limits in the two-dimensional mass plane of\n$m_{G^*}$ vs. $m_{B_H}$.\n", "  A general-purpose all-fiber spectrometer is demonstrated to overcome the\ntrade-off between spectral resolution and bandwidth. By integrating a\nwavelength division multiplexer with five multimode optical fibers, we have\nachieved 100 nm bandwidth with 0.03 nm resolution at wavelength 1500 nm. An\nefficient algorithm is developed to reconstruct the spectrum from the speckle\npattern produced by interference of guided modes in the multimode fibers. Such\nalgorithm enables a rapid, accurate reconstruction of both sparse and dense\nspectra in the presence of noise.\n", "  We designed a high-resolution compact spectrometer based on an\nevanescently-coupled multimode spiral waveguide. Interference between the modes\nin the waveguide forms a wavelength-dependent speckle pattern which is used as\na fingerprint to identify the input wavelength after calibration. Evanescent\ncoupling between neighboring arms of the spiral results in a non-resonant\nbroad-band enhancement of the spectral resolution. Experimentally, we\ndemonstrated a resolution of 0.01 nm at a wavelength of 1520 nm using a 250\n{\\mu}m radius spiral structure. Spectra containing 40 independent spectral\nchannels are recovered simultaneously and the operation bandwidth is\nsignificantly increased by applying compressive sensing to sparse spectra\nreconstruction.\n", "  This paper presents measurements of distributions of charged particles which\nare produced in proton--proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of\n$\\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV and recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. A special\ndataset recorded in 2012 with a small number of interactions per beam crossing\n(below 0.004) and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $160 \\mathrm{\\mu\nb^{-1}}$ was used. A minimum-bias trigger was utilised to select a data sample\nof more than 9 million collision events. The multiplicity, pseudorapidity, and\ntransverse momentum distributions of charged particles are shown in different\nregions of kinematics and charged-particle multiplicity, including measurements\nof final states at high multiplicity. The results are corrected for detector\neffects and are compared to the predictions of various Monte Carlo event\ngenerator models which simulate the full hadronic final state.\n", "  Phononic (thermal) devices are studied such as thermal diode, thermal\ntransistors, thermal logic gates, and thermal memories. However, the thermal\nresistor has not been demonstrated yet. Here, we propose an instantaneously\nadjustable thermal resistor by folded graphene. Through theoretical analysis\nand molecular dynamics simulations, we studied the phonon folding effect and\nthe dependent of thermal resistivity on the length between two folds and the\noverall length. Further, we discuss on the possibility to realize the\ninstantaneously adjustable thermal resistor in experiment. Our studies bring\ninsights in designing thermal resistor and understanding thermal modulation of\n2D materials by adjusting its basic structure parameters.\n", "  A search is performed for a new resonance decaying into a lighter resonance\nand a Z boson. Two channels are studied, targeting the decay of the lighter\nresonance into either a pair of oppositely charged tau leptons or a b b-bar\npair. The Z boson is identified via its decays to electrons or muons. The\nsearch exploits data collected by the CMS experiment at a centre-of-mass energy\nof 8 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.8 inverse femtobarns.\nNo significant deviations are observed from the standard model expectation and\nlimits are set on production cross sections and parameters of two-Higgs-doublet\nmodels.\n", "  We study the two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model using exact diagonalization\nfor spin-1/2 fermions on the triangular and honeycomb lattices decorated with a\nsingle hexagon per site. In certain parameter ranges, the Hubbard model maps to\na quantum compass model on those lattices. On the triangular lattice, the\ncompass model exhibits collinear stripe antiferromagnetism, implying\n$d$-density wave charge order in the original Hubbard model. On the honeycomb\nlattice, the compass model has a unique, quantum disordered ground state that\ntransforms nontrivially under lattice reflection. The ground state of the\nHubbard model on the decorated honeycomb lattice is thus a 2D fermionic\nsymmetry-protected topological phase. This state -- protected by time-reversal\nand reflection symmetries -- cannot be connected adiabatically to a\nfree-fermion topological phase.\n", "  We introduce an intuitive model that describes both the emergence of\ncommunity structure and the evolution of the internal structure of communities\nin growing social networks. The model comprises two complementary mechanisms:\nOne mechanism accounts for the evolution of the internal link structure of a\nsingle community, and the second mechanism coordinates the growth of multiple\noverlapping communities. The first mechanism is based on the assumption that\neach node establishes links with its neighbors and introduces new nodes to the\ncommunity at different rates. We demonstrate that this simple mechanism gives\nrise to an effective maximal degree within communities. This observation is\nrelated to the anthropological theory known as Dunbar's number, i.e., the\nempirical observation of a maximal number of ties which an average individual\ncan sustain within its social groups. The second mechanism is based on a\nrecently proposed generalization of preferential attachment to community\nstructure, appropriately called structural preferential attachment (SPA). The\ncombination of these two mechanisms into a single model (SPA+) allows us to\nreproduce a number of the global statistics of real networks: The distribution\nof community sizes, of node memberships and of degrees. The SPA+ model also\npredicts (a) three qualitative regimes for the degree distribution within\noverlapping communities and (b) strong correlations between the number of\ncommunities to which a node belongs and its number of connections within each\ncommunity. We present empirical evidence that support our findings in real\ncomplex networks.\n", "  Nonsymmorphic symmetries like screws and glides produce electron band\ntouchings, obstructing the formation of a band insulator and leading, instead,\nto metals or nodal semimetals even when the number of electrons in the unit\ncell is an even integer. Here, we calculate the electron fillings compatible\nwith being a band insulator for all 230 space groups, for noninteracting\nelectrons with time-reversal symmetry. Our bounds are tight - that is, we can\nrigorously eliminate band insulators at any forbidden filling and produce\nexplicit models for all allowed fillings - and stronger than those recently\nestablished for interacting systems. These results provide simple criteria that\nshould help guide the search for topological semimetals and, also, have\nimplications for both the nature and stability of the resulting nodal Fermi\nsurfaces.\n", "  Complex networks have non-trivial characteristics and appear in many\nreal-world systems. Such networks are vitally important, but their full\nunderlying dynamics are not completely understood. Utilizing new data sources,\nhowever, can unveil the evolution process of these networks.\n  This study uses the recently published Reddit dataset, containing over 1.65\nbillion comments, to construct the largest publicly available social network\ncorpus to date. We used this dataset to deeply examine the network evolution\nprocess, which resulted in two key observations: First, links are more likely\nto be created among users who join a network at a similar time. Second, the\nrate in which new users join a network is a central factor in molding a\nnetwork's topology; i.e., different user-join patterns create different\ntopological properties.\n  Based on these observations, we developed the \\textit{Temporal Preferential\nAttachment} random network generation model. This model produces not only\nscale-free networks that have relative high clustering coefficients, but also\nnetworks that are sensitive to both the rate and the time in which users join\nthe network. This results in a more accurate and flexible model of how complex\nnetworks evolve, one which more closely represents real-world data.\n", "  In the context of non-geometric type II orientifold compactifications, there\nhave been two formulations for representing the various NS-NS\nBianchi-identities. In the first formulation, the standard three-form flux\n($H_3$), the geometric flux ($\\omega$) and the non-geometric fluxes ($Q$ and\n$R$) are expressed by using the real six-dimensional indices (e.g. $H_{ijk},\n\\omega_{ij}{}^k, Q_i{}^{jk}$ and $R^{ijk}$), and this formulation has been\nheavily utilized for simplifying the scalar potentials in\ntoroidal-orientifolds. On the other hand, relevant for the studies beyond\ntoroidal backgrounds, a second formulation is utilized in which all flux\ncomponents are written in terms of various involutively even/odd $(2,1)$- and\n$(1,1)$-cohomologies of the complex threefold. In the lights of recent model\nbuilding interests and some observations made in arXiv:0705.3410 and\narXiv:0709.2186, in this article, we revisit two most commonly studied toroidal\nexamples in detail to illustrate that the present forms of these two\nformulations are not completely equivalent. To demonstrate the same, we\ntranslate all the identities of the first formulation into cohomology\ningredients, and after a tedious reshuffling of the subsequent constraints,\ninterestingly we find that all the identities of the second formulation are\nembedded into the first formulation which has some additional constraints. In\naddition, we look for the possible solutions of these Bianchi identities in a\ndetailed analysis, and we find that some solutions can reduce the size of\nscalar potential very significantly, and in some cases are too strong to break\nthe no-scale structure completely. Finally, we also comment on the influence of\nimposing some of the solutions of Bianchi identities in studying moduli\nstabilization.\n", "  It has been recently shown that non-Abelian defects with localized\nparafermion zero modes can arise in conventional Abelian fractional quantum\nHall (FQH) states. Here we propose an alternate route to creating,\nmanipulating, and measuring topologically protected degeneracies in bilayer FQH\nstates coupled to superconductors, without the creation of localized\nparafermion zero modes. We focus mainly on electron-hole bilayers, with a $\\pm\n1/3$ Laughlin FQH state in each layer, with boundaries that are\nproximity-coupled to a superconductor. We show that the superconductor induces\ncharge $2e/3$ quasiparticle-pair condensation at each boundary of the FQH\nstate, and that this leads to (1) topologically protected degeneracies that can\nbe measured through charge sensing experiments and (2) a fractional charge\n$2e/3$ AC Josephson effect. We demonstrate that an analog of non-Abelian\nbraiding is possible, despite the absence of a localized zero mode. We discuss\nseveral practical advantages of this proposal over previous work, and also\nextensions to electron-electron bilayers at $\\nu = 2/3 + 1/3$ coupled to\nsuperconductivity, and to electron-hole bilayers with only interlayer\ntunneling.\n", "  Cellular automata can show well known features of quantum mechanics, such as\na linear updating rule that resembles a discretized form of the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation together with its conservation laws. Surprisingly, a whole class of\n\"natural\" Hamiltonian cellular automata, which are based entirely on\ninteger-valued variables and couplings and derived from an Action Principle,\ncan be mapped reversibly to continuum models with the help of Sampling Theory.\nThis results in \"deformed\" quantum mechanical models with a finite discreteness\nscale $l$, which for $l\\rightarrow 0$ reproduce the familiar continuum limit.\nPresently, we show, in particular, how such automata can form \"multipartite\"\nsystems consistently with the tensor product structures of nonrelativistic\nmany-body quantum mechanics, while maintaining the linearity of dynamics.\nConsequently, the Superposition Principle is fully operative already on the\nlevel of these primordial discrete deterministic automata, including the\nessential quantum effects of interference and entanglement.\n", "  We elucidate how Quantum Thermodynamics at temperature $T$ emerges from pure\nand classical SU(2) Yang-Mills theory on a four-dimensional Euclidean spacetime\nslice $S_1\\times {\\bf R}^3$. The concept of a (deconfining) thermal ground\nstate, composed of certain solutions to the fundamental, classical Yang-Mills\nequation, allows for a unified addressation of both (classical) wave- and\n(quantum) particle-like excitations thereof.\n", "  The order of the superconducting phase transition is analyzed via the\nfunctional renormalization group approach. For the first time, we derive fully\nanalytic expressions for the $\\beta$ functions of the charge and the\nself-coupling in the Abelian Higgs model with one complex scalar field in $d=3$\ndimensions that support the existence of two charged fixed points: an infrared\n(IR) stable fixed point describing a second-order phase transition and a\ntritical fixed point controlling the region of the parameter space that is\nattracted by the former one. It is found that the region separating first- and\nsecond-order transitions can be uniquely characterized by the Ginzburg-Landau\nparameter $\\kappa$, and the system undergoes a second order transition, only if\n$\\kappa>\\kappa_c \\approx 0.62/\\sqrt2$.\n", "  Heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) provide the simplest explanation for the\norigin of light neutrino masses and mixings. If the RHN masses are at or below\nthe weak scale, direct experimental discovery of these states is possible at\naccelerator experiments such as the LHC or new dedicated beam dump experiments;\nin such experiments, the RHN decays after traversing a macroscopic distance\nfrom the collision point. The experimental sensitivity to RHNs is significantly\nenhanced if there is a new \"dark\" gauge force connecting them to the Standard\nModel (SM), and detection of RHNs can be the primary discovery mode for the new\ndark force itself. We take the well-motivated example of a B-L gauge symmetry\nand analyze the sensitivity to displaced decays of the RHNs produced via the\nnew gauge interaction in two experiments: the LHC and the proposed SHiP beam\ndump experiment. In the most favorable case in which the mediator can be\nproduced on-shell and decays to RHNs, the sensitivity reach is controlled by\nthe square of the B-L gauge coupling. We demonstrate that these experiments\ncould access neutrino parameters responsible for the observed SM neutrino\nmasses and mixings in the most straightforward implementation of the see-saw\nmechanism.\n", "  Discrete breathers are ubiquitous structures in nonlinear anharmonic models\nranging from the prototypical example of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam model to\nKlein-Gordon nonlinear lattices, among many others. We propose a general\ncriterion for the emergence of instabilities of discrete breathers analogous to\nthe well-established Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion for solitary waves. The\ncriterion involves the change of monotonicity of the discrete breather's energy\nas a function of the breather frequency. Our analysis suggests and numerical\nresults corroborate that breathers with increasing (decreasing)\nenergy-frequency dependence are generically unstable in soft (hard) nonlinear\npotentials.\n", "  We investigate cosmological aspects of spontaneous baryogenesis driven by a\nscalar field, and present general constraints that are independent of the\nparticle physics model. The relevant constraints are obtained by studying the\nbackreaction of the produced baryons on the scalar field, the cosmological\nexpansion history after baryogenesis, and the baryon isocurvature\nperturbations. We show that cosmological considerations alone provide powerful\nconstraints, especially for the minimal scenario with a quadratic scalar\npotential. Intriguingly, we find that for a given inflation scale, the other\nparameters including the reheat temperature, decoupling temperature of the\nbaryon violating interactions, and the mass and decay constant of the scalar\nare restricted to lie within ranges of at most a few orders of magnitude. We\nalso discuss possible extensions to the minimal setup, and propose two ideas\nfor evading constraints on isocurvature perturbations: one is to suppress the\nbaryon isocurvature with nonquadratic scalar potentials, another is to\ncompensate the baryon isocurvature with cold dark matter isocurvature by making\nthe scalar survive until the present.\n", "  Simplified Models are a useful way to characterize new physics scenarios for\nthe LHC. Particle decays are often represented using non-renormalizable\noperators that involve the minimal number of fields required by symmetries.\nGeneralizing to a wider class of decay operators allows one to model a variety\nof final states. This approach, which we dub the $n$-body extension of\nSimplified Models, provides a unifying treatment of the signal phase space\nresulting from a variety of signals. In this paper, we present the first\napplication of this framework in the context of multijet plus missing energy\nsearches. The main result of this work is a global performance study with the\ngoal of identifying which set of observables yields the best discriminating\npower against the largest Standard Model backgrounds for a wide range of signal\njet multiplicities. Our analysis compares combinations of one, two and three\nvariables, placing emphasis on the enhanced sensitivity gain resulting from\nnon-trivial correlations. Utilizing boosted decision trees, we compare and\nclassify the performance of missing energy, energy scale and energy structure\nobservables. We demonstrate that including an observable from each of these\nthree classes is required to achieve optimal performance. This work\nadditionally serves to establish the utility of $n$-body extended Simplified\nModels as a diagnostic for unpacking the relative merits of different search\nstrategies, thereby motivating their application to new physics signatures\nbeyond jets and missing energy.\n", "  In this paper transformations for matrix orthogonal polynomials in the real\nline are studied. The orthogonality is understood in a broad sense, and is\ngiven in terms of a nondegenerate continuous sesquilinear form, which in turn\nis determined by a quasidefinite matrix of bivariate generalized functions with\na well defined support. The discussion of the orthogonality for such a\nsesquilinear form includes, among others, matrix Hankel cases with linear\nfunctionals, general matrix Sobolev orthogonality and discrete orthogonal\npolynomials with an infinite support. The first transformation considered is\nthat of Geronimus type, two different methods are developed. A spectral one,\nbased on the spectral properties of the perturbing polynomial, and constructed\nin terms of the second kind functions. Then, using spectral techniques and\nspectral jets, Christoffel-Geronimus formulas for the transformed polynomials\nand norms are presented. For this type of transformations, the paper also\nproposes an alternative method, which does not require of spectral techniques.\nA discussion on matrix spectral linear transformations is presented, as well.\nThese transformations can be understood as rational perturbations of the matrix\nof bivariate generalized functions together with an addition of appropriate\nmasses, determined these last ones by the spectral properties of the polynomial\ndenominator. As for the Geronimus case, two techniques are applied, spectral\nand mixed spectral/nonspectral. Christoffel--Geronimus--Uvarov formulas are\nfound with both approaches and some applications are given. The transformation\ntheory is finally discussed in the context of the 2D non-Abelian Toda lattice\nand noncommutative KP hierarchies, understood as the theory of continuous\ntransformations of quasidefinite sesquilinear forms. This approach allows for\nthe finding of perturbed quasitau and Baker matrices.\n", "  We study direct detection in simplified models of Dark Matter (DM) in which\ninteractions with Standard Model (SM) fermions are mediated by a heavy vector\nboson. We consider fully general, gauge-invariant couplings between the SM, the\nmediator and both scalar and fermion DM. We account for the evolution of the\ncouplings between the energy scale of the mediator mass and the nuclear energy\nscale. This running arises from virtual effects of SM particles and its\ninclusion is not optional. We compare bounds on the mediator mass from direct\ndetection experiments with and without accounting for the running. In some\ncases the inclusion of these effects changes the bounds by several orders of\nmagnitude, as a consequence of operator mixing which generates new interactions\nat low energy. We also highlight the importance of these effects when\ntranslating LHC limits on the mediator mass into bounds on the direct detection\ncross section. For an axial-vector mediator, the running can alter the derived\nbounds on the spin-dependent DM-nucleon cross section by a factor of two or\nmore. Finally, we provide tools to facilitate the inclusion of these effects in\nfuture studies: general approximate expressions for the low energy couplings\nand a public code runDM to evolve the couplings between arbitrary energy\nscales.\n", "  It has recently been recognized by the author that the quantum contextuality\nparadigm may be formulated in terms of the properties of some subgroups of the\ntwo-letter free group $G$ and their corresponding point-line incidence geometry\n$\\mathcal{G}$. I introduce a fundamental homomorphism $f$ mapping the\n(infinitely many) words of G to the permutations ruling the symmetries of\n$\\mathcal{G}$. The substructure of $f$ is revealing the essence of geometric\ncontextuality in a straightforward way.\n", "  We investigate the possible location of the critical endpoint in the QCD\nphase diagram based on nonlocal covariant PNJL models including a vector\ninteraction channel. The form factors of the covariant interaction are\nconstrained by lattice QCD data for the quark propagator. The comparison of our\nresults for the pressure including the pion contribution and the scaled\npressure shift $\\Delta P / T^4$ vs $T/T_c$ with lattice QCD results shows a\nbetter agreement when Lorentzian formfactors for the nonlocal interactions and\nthe wave function renormalization are considered. The strength of the vector\ncoupling is used as a free parameter which influences results at finite\nbaryochemical potential. It is used to adjust the slope of the pseudocritical\ntemperature of the chiral phase transition at low baryochemical potential and\nthe scaled pressure shift accessible in lattice QCD simulations. Our study,\nalbeit presently performed at the meanfield level, supports the very existence\nof a critical point and favors its location within a region that is accessible\nin experiments at the NICA accelerator complex.\n", "  Using the algebraic approach to entanglement entropy, we study several dual\npairs of lattice theories and show how the entropy is completely preserved\nacross each duality. Our main result is that a maximal algebra of observables\nin a region typically dualizes to a non-maximal algebra in a dual region. In\nparticular, we show how the usual notion of tracing out external degrees of\nfreedom dualizes to a tracing out coupled to an additional summation over\nsuperselection sectors. We briefly comment on possible extensions of our\nresults to more intricate dualities, including holographic ones.\n", "  This book introduces the theoretical description and properties of quantum\nfluids. The focus is on gaseous atomic Bose-Einstein condensates and, to a\nminor extent, superfluid helium, but the underlying concepts are relevant to\nother forms of quantum fluids such as polariton and photonic condensates. The\nbook is pitched at the level of advanced undergraduates and early postgraduate\nstudents, aiming to provide the reader with the knowledge and skills to develop\ntheir own research project on quantum fluids. Indeed, the content for this book\ngrew from introductory notes provided to our own research students. It is\nassumed that the reader has prior knowledge of undergraduate mathematics and/or\nphysics; otherwise, the concepts are introduced from scratch, often with\nreferences for directed further reading.\n", "  It is well known that all rotating perfect fluid stars in general relativity\nare unstable to certain non-axisymmetric perturbations via the\nChandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz (CFS) instability. However, the mechanism of the\nCFS instability requires, in an essential way, the loss of angular momentum by\ngravitational radiation and, in many instances, it acts on too long a timescale\nto be physically/astrophysically relevant. It is therefore of interest to\nexamine the stability of rotating, relativistic stars to axisymmetric\nperturbations, where the CFS instability does not occur. In this paper, we\nprovide a Rayleigh-Ritz type variational principle for testing the stability of\nperfect fluid stars to axisymmetric perturbations, which generalizes to\naxisymmetric perturbations of rotating stars a variational principle given by\nChandrasekhar for spherical perturbations of static, spherical stars. Our\nvariational principle provides a lower bound to the rate of exponential growth\nin the case of instability. The derivation closely parallels the derivation of\na recently obtained variational principle for analyzing the axisymmetric\nstability of black holes.\n", "  We analyze the string spectrum of flat space in polar coordinates, following\nthe small curvature limit of the $SL(2,\\mathbb{R})/U(1)$ cigar CFT. We first\nanalyze the partition function of the cigar itself, making some clarifications\nof the structure of the spectrum that have escaped attention up to this point.\nThe superstring spectrum (type 0 and type II) is shown to exhibit an involution\nsymmetry, that survives the small curvature limit. We classify all marginal\nstates in polar coordinates for type II superstrings, with emphasis on their\nlinks and their superconformal structure. This classification is confirmed by\nan explicit large $\\tau_2$ analysis of the partition function. Next we compare\nthree approaches towards the type II genus one entropy in Rindler space: using\na sum-over-fields strategy, using a Melvin model approach and finally using a\nsaddle point method on the cigar partition function. In each case we highlight\npossible obstructions and motivate that the correct procedures yield a\nvanishing result: $S=0$. We finally discuss how the QFT UV divergences of the\nfields in the spectrum disappear when computing the free energy and entropy\nusing Euclidean techniques.\n", "  A consistent theoretical description of physics at high energies requires an\nassessment of vacuum stability in either the Standard Model or any extension of\nit. Especially supersymmetric extensions allow for several vacua and the choice\nof the desired electroweak one gives strong constraints on the parameter space.\nAs the general parameter space in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is\nhuge, any severe constraint on it unrelated to direct phenomenological\nobservations enhances the predictability of the model. We perform an updated\nanalysis of possible charge and color breaking minima without relying on fixed\ndirections in field space that minimize certain terms in the potential (known\nas \"D-flat\" directions). Concerning the cosmological stability of false vacua,\nwe argue that there are always directions in configuration space which lead to\nvery short-lived vacua and therefore such exclusions are strict. In addition to\nexisting strong constraints on the parameter space, we find even stronger\nconstraints extending the field space compared to previous analyses and combine\nthose constraints with predictions for the light CP-even Higgs mass in the\nMinimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. Low masses for supersymmetric partners\nare excluded from vacuum stability in combination with the 125 GeV Higgs and\nthe allowed parameter space opens at a few TeV.\n", "  Three objections to the canonical analytical treatment of covariant\nelectromagnetic theory are presented: (i) only half of Maxwell's equations are\npresent upon variation of the fundamental Lagrangian; (ii) the trace of the\ncanonical energy-momentum tensor is not equivalent to the trace of the observed\nenergy-momentum tensor; (iii) the Belinfante symmetrization procedure exists\nseparate from the analytical approach in order to obtain the known observed\nresult. It is shown that the analytical construction from Noether's theorem is\nbased on manipulations that were developed to obtain the compact forms of the\ntheory presented by Minkowski and Einstein; presentations which were developed\nbefore the existence of Noether's theorem. By reformulating the fundamental\nLagrangian, all of the objections are simultaneously relieved. Variation of the\nproposed Lagrangian yields the complete set of Maxwell's equations in the\nEuler-Lagrange equation of motion, and the observed energy-momentum tensor\ndirectly follows from Noether's theorem. Previously unavailable symmetries and\nidentities that follow naturally from this procedure are also discussed.\n", "  McStas and Mantid are two well established software frameworks within the\nneutron scattering community. McStas has been primarily used for simulating the\nneutron transport of instruments, while Mantid has been primarily used for data\nreduction. We report here the status of our work done on the interoperability\nbetween the instrument simulation software McStas and the data reduction\nsoftware Mantid. This provides a demonstration of how to successfully link\ntogether two software that otherwise have been developed independently, and in\nparticular here show how this has been achieved for an instrument simulation\nsoftware and a data reduction software. This paper will also provide examples\nof some of the expected future enhanced analysis that can be achieved from\ncombining accurate instrument and sample simulations with software for\ncorrecting raw data. In the case of this work for raw data collected at large\nscale neutron facilities.\n", "  We have investigated the effects of magnetic Ni and nonmagnetic Zn impurities\non the superconductivity in undoped T'-La$_{1.8}$Eu$_{0.2}$CuO$_4$ (T'-LECO)\nwith the Nd$_2$CuO$_4$-type structure, using the polycrystalline bulk samples,\nto clarify the pairing symmetry. It has been found that both suppression rates\nof the superconducting transition temperature $T_\\mathrm{c}$ by Ni and Zn\nimpurities are nearly the same and are very similar to those in the optimally\ndoped and overdoped regimes of hole-doped T-La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ with the\nK$_2$NiF$_4$-type structure. These results strongly suggest that the\nsuperconductivity in undoped T'-LECO is of the $d$-wave symmetry and is\nmediated by the spin fluctuation.\n", "  The effect of off-plane impurity on superconductivity and non-Fermi-liquid\n(NFL) behavior in the layered heavy-fermion compound CeCo$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$In$_5$\nis investigated by specific heat, magnetization, and electrical resistivity\nmeasurements. These measurements reveal that the superconducting (SC)\ntransition temperature T$_c$ monotonically decreases from 2.3 K (x=0) to 0.8 K\n(x=0.20) with increasing x, and then the SC order disappears above x=0.25. At\nthe same time, the Ni substitution yields the NFL behavior at zero field for\nx=0.25, characterized by the -ln T divergence in specific heat divided by\ntemperature, C$_p$/T, and magnetic susceptibility, M/B. The NFL behavior in\nmagnetic fields for x=0.25 is quite similar to that seen at around the SC upper\ncritical field in pure CeCoIn$_5$, suggesting that both compounds are governed\nby the same antiferromagnetic quantum criticality. The resemblance of the\ndoping effect on the SC order among Ni- , Sn-, and Pt-substituted CeCoIn5\nsupports the argument that the doped carriers are primarily responsible for the\nbreakdown of the SC order. The present investigation further reveals the\nquantitative differences in the trends of the suppression of superconductivity\nbetween Ce(Co,Ni)In$_5$ and the other alloys, such as the rates of decrease in\nT$_c$, dT$_c$/dx, and specific heat jump at T$_c$, d($\\Delta$C$_p$/T$_c$)/dx.\nWe suggest that the occupied positions of the doped ions play an important role\nin the origin of these differences.\n", "  IrTe$_2$ has been renewed as an interesting system showing competing\nphenomenon between a questionable density-wave transition near 270 K followed\nby superconductivity with doping of high atomic number materials. Higher atomic\nnumbers of Te and Ir supports strong spin-orbital coupling in this system.\nUsing dynamical mean field theory with LDA band structure I have introduced\nRashba spin orbit coupling in this system to get the interpretation for\nanomalous resistivity and related transition in this system. While no\nconsiderable changes are observed in DMFT results of Ir-5d band other than\norbital selective pseudogap pinned to Fermi level, Te-p band shows a van Hove\nsingularity at the Fermi level except low temperature. Finally I discuss the\nimplications of these results in theoretical understanding of ordering in\nIrTe$_2$.\n", "  Among the frustrated magnetic materials, spin-ice stands out as a\nparticularly interesting system. Residual entropy, freezing and glassiness,\nKasteleyn transitions and fractionalisation of excitations in three dimensions\nall stem from a simple classical Hamiltonian. But is the usual spin-ice\nHamiltonian a correct description of the experimental systems? Here we address\nthis issue by measuring magnetic susceptibility in the two most studied\nspin-ice compounds, Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ and Ho$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, using a vector\nmagnet. Using these results, and guided by a theoretical analysis of possible\ndistortions to the pyrochlore lattice, we construct an effective Hamiltonian\nand explore it using Monte Carlo simulations. We show how this Hamiltonian\nreproduces the experimental results, including the formation of a phase of\nintermediate polarisation, and gives important information about the possible\nground-state of real spin-ice systems. Our work suggests an unusual situation\nin which distortions might contribute to the preservation rather than relief of\nthe effects of frustration.\n", "  We present new photometry and spectroscopy of the 94m eclipsing binary\nLSQ1725-64 that provide insight into the fundamental parameters and\nevolutionary state of this system. We confirm that LSQ1725-64 is a magnetic\ncataclysmic variable whose white dwarf has a surface-averaged magnetic field\nstrength of $12.5 \\pm 0.5$ MG measured from Zeeman splitting. The spectral type\nand colour of the secondary, as well as the eclipse length, are consistent with\nother secondaries that have not yet evolved through the period minimum expected\nfor cataclysmic variables. We observe two different states of mass transfer and\nmeasure the transition between the two to occur over about 45 orbital cycles.\nIn the low state, we observe photometric variations that we hypothesize to\narise predominantly from two previously heated magnetic poles of the white\ndwarf. Our precise eclipse measurements allow us to determine binary parameters\nof LSQ1725-64 and we find it contains a high mass ($0.97 \\pm 0.03\\ M_{\\odot}$)\nwhite dwarf if we assume a typical mass-radius relationship for a CO core white\ndwarf. We also measure an eclipse of the accretion stream after the white dwarf\neclipse, and use it to estimate an upper limit of the mass transfer rate. This\nderived limit is consistent with that expected from angular momentum loss via\ngravitational radiation alone.\n", "  We study the stability of hexaquark systems containing two heavy quarks and\nfour light quarks within a simple quark model. No bound or metastable state is\nfound. The reason stems on a delicate interplay between chromoelectric and\nchromomagnetic effects. Our calculation provides also information about\nanticharmed pentaquarks that are seemingly unbound in simple quark models.\n", "  In a previous paper, we proposed a new gravitational energy momentum tensor.\nHere we use this tensor to evaluate the gravitational energies both inside and\noutside the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. Our results show that all of\nthe gravitational energy exists outside the horizon, and that there is no\ngravitational energy inside the horizon. We comment on a relation with our\ngravitational energy momentum tensor and another one which is proposed in a\nteleparallel gravity.\n", "  We show that the study of scalar resonances at various vector boson\nscattering processes at the Large Hadron Collider can serve as a useful tool to\ndistinguish between different extensions of the scalar sector of the Standard\nModel. The recent measurement of the Higgs boson properties leaves enough room\nfor the extended scalar sectors to be relevant for such studies. The shape of\nthe resonances, being model dependent, can shed light on the viable parameter\nspace of a number of theoretical models.\n", "  This paper concerns electromagnetic 3D subsurface imaging in connection with\nsparsity of signal sources. We explored an imaging approach that can be\nimplemented in situations that allow obtaining a large amount of data over a\nsurface or a set of orbits but at the same time require sparsity of the signal\nsources. Characteristic to such a tomography scenario is that it necessitates\nthe inversion technique to be genuinely three-dimensional: For example, slicing\nis not possible due to the low number of sources. Here, we primarily focused on\nastrophysical subsurface exploration purposes. As an example target of our\nnumerical experiments we used a synthetic small planetary object containing\nthree inclusions, e.g. voids, of the size of the wavelength. A tetrahedral\narrangement of source positions was used, it being the simplest symmetric point\nconfiguration in 3D. Our results suggest that somewhat reliable inversion\nresults can be produced within the present a priori assumptions, if the data\ncan be recorded at a specific resolution. This is valuable early-stage\nknowledge especially for design of future planetary missions in which the\npayload needs to be minimized, and potentially also for the development of\nother lightweight subsurface inspection systems.\n", "  We designed a simple setup to measure the muon lifetime and the electron\nenergy spectra of muon decay. A low cost coincidental circuit was designed to\nselect the signals of muon decay events detected by a plastic scintillator\ndetector. It triggered a digital oscilloscope to record the signals of muon\ndecay events for measuring the muon lifetime and electron energy spectrum. A\nLandau-distribution energy loss method was introduced to conduct the energy\ncalibration of the system. The experimental results were well reproduced by the\nMonte Carlo simulation. The software and hardware of the system are completely\nopen to students, thus more helpful for instruction and motivation.\n", "  Nonrelativistic scalar field theories can exhibit a natural cascading\nhierarchy of scales, protected by a hierarchy of polynomial shift symmetries.\nUsing a simple model, we argue that a high-energy cross-over to such\nnonrelativistic behavior naturally leads to light scalars, and thus represents\na useful ingredient for technically natural resolutions of scalar mass\nhierarchies, perhaps even the Higgs mass hierarchy puzzle.\n", "  We calculate vibrational spectra of ultralong-range Cs(32p) Rydberg molecules\nwhich form in an ultracold gas of Cs atoms. We account for the partial-wave\nscattering of the Rydberg electrons from the ground Cs perturber atoms by\nincluding the full set of spin-resolved ${}^{1,3}S_J$ and ${}^{1,3}P_J$\nscattering phase shifts, and allow for the mixing of singlet (S=0) and triplet\n(S=1) spin states through Rydberg electron spin-orbit and ground electron\nhyperfine interactions. Excellent agreement with observed data in\nSa{\\ss}mannshausen et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 133201(2015)] in line\npositions and profiles is obtained. We also determine the spin-dependent\npermanent electric dipole moments for these molecules. This is the first such\ncalculation of ultralong-range Rydberg molecules in which all of the\nrelativistic contributions are accounted for.\n", "  In this paper we develop an operational formulation of General Relativity\nsimilar in spirit to existing operational formulations of Quantum Theory. To do\nthis we introduce an operational space (or op-space) built out of scalar\nfields. A point in op-space corresponds to some nominated set of scalar fields\ntaking some given values in coincidence. We assert that op-space is the space\nin which we observe the world. We introduce also a notion of agency (this\ncorresponds to the ability to set knob settings just like in Operational\nQuantum Theory). The effects of agents' actions should only be felt to the\nfuture so we introduce also a time direction field. Agency and time direction\ncan be understood as effective notions. We show how to formulate General\nRelativity as a possibilistic theory and as a probabilistic theory. In the\npossibilistic case we provide a compositional framework for calculating whether\nsome operationally described situation is possible or not. In the probabilistic\nversion we introduce probabilities and provide a compositional framework for\ncalculating the probability of some operationally described situation. Finally\nwe look at the quantum case. We review the operator tensor formulation of\nQuantum Theory and use it to set up an approach to Quantum Field Theory that is\nboth operational and compositional. Then we consider strategies for solving the\nproblem of Quantum Gravity. By referring only to operational quantities we are\nable to provide formulations for the possibilistic, probabilistic, and (the\nnascent) quantum cases that are manifestly invariant under diffeomorphisms.\n", "  We perform numerical simulations of gravitational collapse in Einstein-aether\ntheory. We find that under certain conditions, the collapse results in the\ntemporary formation of a white hole horizon.\n", "  Solid-state programmable metallization cells have attracted considerable\nattention as memristive elements for Redox-based Resistive Random Access Memory\n(ReRAM) for low-power and low-voltage applications. In principle, liquid-state\nmetallization cells could offer the same advantages for aqueous systems, such\nas biomedical lab-on-a-chip devices, but robust resistive switching has not yet\nbeen achieved in liquid electrolytes, where electrodeposition is notoriously\nunstable to the formation of fractal dendrites. Here, the recently discovered\nphysics of shock electrodeposition are harnessed to stabilize aqueous copper\ngrowth in polycarbonate nanopores, whose surfaces are modified with charged\npolymers. Stable bipolar resistive switching is demonstrated for 500 cycles\nwith <10s retention times, prior to any optimization of the geometry or\nmaterials.\n", "  This article deals with study of the steady flow and heat transfer\ncharacteristics of Sisko fluid over a rotating infinite disk. The flow and heat\ntransfer aspects are thoroughly investigated encompassing highly shear\nthinning/thickening Sisko fluids. The modeled boundary layer equations are\nreduced to a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations using the\nappropriate transformation. The resulting equations are then solved numerically\nby shooting method in the domain . The numerical data for the velocity and\ntemperature fields are graphically sketched and effects of the relevant\nparameters are discussed in detail. In addition, the velocity gradients at the\ndisk surface and the local Nusselt number for different values of the\npertaining parameters are given in tabulated form. Further, the flow and\ntemperature fields of power-law and Newtonian fluids are also compared with\nthose Sisko fluid. Moreover, a comparison with previously published work, as a\nspecial case of the problem, has been provided and the results are found to be\nin excellent agreement.\n", "  We investigate the combined effect of solar wind, Poynting-Robertson drag,\nand the frozen-in interplanetary magnetic field on the motion of charged dust\ngrains in our solar system. For this reason we derive a secular theory of\nmotion by the means of averaging method and validate it with numerical\nsimulations of the un-averaged equations of motions. The theory predicts that\nthe secular motion of charged particles is mainly affected by the z-component\nof the solar magnetic axis, or the normal component of the interplanetary\nmagnetic field. The normal component of the interplanetary magnetic field leads\nto an increase or decrease of semi-major axis depending on its functional form\nand sign of charge of the dust grain. It is generally accepted that the\ncombined effects of solar wind and photon absorption and re-emmision\n(Poynting-Robertson drag) lead to a decrease in semi-major axis on secular time\nscales. On the contrary, we demonstrate that the interplanetary magnetic field\nmay counteract these drag forces under certain circumstances. We derive a\nsimple relation between the parameters of the magnetic field, the physical\nproperties of the dust grain as well as the shape and orientation of the\norbital ellipse of the particle, which is a necessary conditions for the\nstabilization in semi-major axis.\n", "  We describe the characterization and removal of noise present in the Inertial\nMeasurement Unit (IMU) MPU-6050. This IMU was initially used in an attitude\nsensor (AS) developed in-house, and subsequently implemented in a pointing and\nstabilization platform developed for small balloon-borne astronomical payloads.\nWe found that the performance of the IMU degrades with time due to the\naccumulation of different errors. Using the Allan variance analysis method, we\nidentified the different components of noise present in the IMU and verified\nthe results using a power spectral density analysis (PSD). We tried to remove\nthe high-frequency noise using smoothing filters, such as moving average filter\nand Savitzky-Golay filter. Although we did manage to filter some of the\nhigh-frequency noise, the performance of these filters was not satisfactory for\nour application. We found the distribution of the random noise present in the\nIMU using a probability density analysis, and identified the noise to be white\nGaussian in nature which we successfully removed by a Kalman filter in real\ntime.\n", "  A microstructured graphitic 4x4 multielectrode array was embedded in a single\ncrystal diamond substrate (4x4 {uG-SCD MEA) for real-time monitoring of\nexocytotic events from cultured chromaffin cells and adrenal slices. The\ncurrent approach relies on the development of a parallel ion beam lithographic\ntechnique, which assures the time effective fabrication of extended arrays with\nreproducible electrode dimensions. The reported device is suitable for\nperforming amperometric and voltammetric recordings with high sensitivity and\ntemporal resolution, by simultaneously acquiring data from 16 rectangularly\nshaped microelectrodes (20x3.5 um^2) separated by 200 um gaps. Taking advantage\nof the array geometry we addressed the following specific issues: i) detect\nboth the spontaneous and KCl-evoked secretion simultaneously from several\nchromaffin cells directly cultured on the device surface, ii) resolve the\nwaveform of different subsets of exocytotic events, iii) monitoring quantal\nsecretory events from thin slices of the adrenal gland. The frequency of\nspontaneous release was low (0.12 Hz and 0.3 Hz respectively for adrenal slices\nand cultured cells) and increased up to 0.9 Hz after stimulation with 30 mM KCl\nin cultured cells. The spike amplitude as well as rise and decay time were\ncomparable with those measured by carbon fiber microelectrodes and allowed to\nidentify three different subsets of secretory events associated to \"full\nfusion\" events, \"kiss and-run\" and \"kiss-and-stay\" exocytosis, confirming that\nthe device has adequate sensitivity and time resolution for real-time\nrecordings. The device offers the significant advantage of shortening the time\nto collect data by allowing simultaneous recordings from cell populations\neither in primary cell cultures or in intact tissues.\n", "  This paper presents experimental data and analysis of the structural damage\ncaused by swift-heavy ion irradiation of single-crystal diamond. The patterned\nburied structural damage is shown to generate, via swelling, a mirror-pattern\non the sample surface, which remains largely damage-free. While extensive\nresults are available for light ion implantations, this effect is reported here\nfor the first time in the heavy ion regime, where a completely different range\nof input parameters (in terms of ion species, energy, stopping power, etc.) is\navailable for customized irradiation. The chosen ion species are Au and Br, in\nthe energy range 10-40 MeV. The observed patterns, as characterized by\nprofilometry and atomic force microscopy, are reported in a series of model\nexperiments, which show swelling patterns ranging from a few nm to above 200\nnm. Moreover, a systematic phenomenological modelling is presented, in which\nsurface swelling measurements are correlated to buried crystal damage. A\ncomparison is made with data for light ion implantations, showing good\ncompatibility with the proposed models. The modelling presented in this work\ncan be useful for the design and realization of micropatterned surfaces in\nsingle crystal diamond, allowing to generate highly customized structures by\ncombining appropriately chosen irradiation parameters and masks.\n", "  The effects of lunar surface roughness, on both small and large scales, on\nAskaryan radio pulses generated by particle cascades beneath the lunar surface\nhas never been fully estimated. Surface roughness affects the chances of a\npulse escaping the lunar surface, its coherency, and the characteristic\ndetection geometry. It will affect the expected signal shape, the relative\nutility of different frequency bands, the telescope pointing positions on the\nlunar disk, and most fundamentally, the chances of detecting the known UHE\ncosmic ray and any prospective UHE neutrino flux. Near-future radio-telescopes\nsuch as FAST and the SKA promise to be able to detect the flux of cosmic rays,\nand it is critical that surface roughness be treated appropriately in\nsimulations. of the lunar Askaryan technique. In this contribution, a facet\nmodel for lunar surface roughness is combined with a method to propagate\ncoherent radio pulses through boundaries to estimate the full effects of lunar\nsurface roughness on neutrino-detection probabilities. The method is able to\nproduce pulses from parameterised particle cascades beneath the lunar surface\nas would be viewed by an observer at Earth, including all polarisation and\ncoherency effects. Results from this calculation are presented for both\ncharacteristic cosmic ray and neutrino cascades, and estimates of the effects\nmentioned above - particularly signal shape, frequency-dependence, and\nsensitivity - are presented.\n", "  We use the renormalization group method to study model E of critical dynamics\nin the presence of velocity fluctuations arising in accordance with the\nstochastic Navier-Stokes equation. Using Martin-Siggia-Rose theorem, we obtain\na field- theoretical model that allows a perturbative renormalization group\nanalysis. By direct power counting and an analysis of ultraviolet divergences,\nwe show that the model is multiplicatively renormalizable, and we use a\ntwo-parameter expansion in $\\varepsilon$ and $\\delta$ to calculate\nrenormalization constants. Here, $\\varepsilon$ is a deviation from the critical\ndimension four, and $\\delta$ is a deviation from the Kolmogorov regime. We\npresent the results of the one-loop approximation and part of the fixed-point\nstructure. We briefly discuss the possible effect of velocity fluctuations on\nthe large-scale behavior of the model.\n", "  We propose an efficient and flexible method for solving Abel integral\nequation of the first kind, frequently appearing in many fields of\nastrophysics, physics, chemistry, and applied sciences. This equation\nrepresents an ill-posed problem, thus solving it requires some kind of\nregularization. Our method is based on solving the equation on a so-called\ncompact set of functions and/or using Tikhonov's regularization. A priori\nconstraints on the unknown function, defining a compact set, are very loose and\ncan be set using simple physical considerations. Tikhonov's regularization on\nitself does not require any explicit a priori constraints on the unknown\nfunction and can be used independently of such constraints or in combination\nwith them. Various target degrees of smoothness of the unknown function may be\nset, as required by the problem at hand. The advantage of the method, apart\nfrom its flexibility, is that it gives uniform convergence of the approximate\nsolution to the exact solution, as the errors of input data tend to zero. The\nmethod is illustrated on several simulated models with known solutions. An\nexample of astrophysical application of the method is also given.\n", "  A combined experimental and numerical study on the variation of the elastic\nproperties of defective single-crystal diamond is presented for the first time,\nby comparing nano-indentation measurements on MeV-ion-implanted samples with\nmulti-scale modeling consisting of both ab initio atomistic calculations and\nmeso-scale Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. It is found that by locally\nintroducing defects in the 2x10^18 - 5x10^21 cm-3 density range, a significant\nreduction of, as well as of density, can be induced in the diamond crystal\nstructure without incurring in the graphitization of the material. Ab initio\natomistic simulations confirm the experimental findings with a good degree of\nconfidence. FEM simulations are further employed to verify the consistency of\nmeasured deformations with a stiffness reduction, and to derive strain and\nstress levels in the implanted region. Combining these experimental and\nnumerical results, we also provide insight into the mechanism responsible for\nthe depth dependence of the graphitization threshold in diamond. This work\nprospects the possibility of achieving accurate tunability of the mechanical\nproperties of single-crystal diamond through defect engineering, with\nsignificant technological applications, i.e. the fabrication and control of the\nresonant frequency of diamond-based micromechanical resonators.\n", "  In order to interpret recent experimental studies of the dependence of\nconductance of ds-DNA as the DNA is pulled from the 3'end1-3'end2 ends, which\nfind a sharp conductance jump for a very short (4.5 %) stretching length, we\ncarried out multiscale modeling, to predict the conductance of dsDNA as it is\nmechanically stretched to promote various structural polymorphisms. We\ncalculate the current along the stretched DNA using a combination of molecular\ndynamics simulations, non-equilibrium pulling simulations, quantum mechanics\ncalculations, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. For 5'end1-5'end2\nattachments we find an abrupt jump in the current within a very short\nstretching length (6 $ \\AA $ or 17 %) leading to a melted DNA state. In\ncontrast, for 3'end1-3'end2 pulling it takes almost 32$ \\AA $ (84 %) of\nstretching to cause a similar jump in the current. Thus, we demonstrate that\ncharge transport in DNA can occur over stretching lengths of several\nnanometers. We find that this unexpected behaviour in the B to S conformational\nDNA transition arises from highly inclined base pair geometries that result\nfrom this pulling protocol. We find that the dramatically different conductance\nbehaviors for two different pulling protocols arise from the nature of how\nhydrogen bonds of DNA base pairs break.\n", "  Due to their outstanding mechanical properties, diamond and diamond-like\nmaterials find significant technological applications ranging from\nwell-established industrial fields (cutting tools, coatings, etc.) to more\nadvanced mechanical devices as micro- and nano-electromechanical systems. The\nuse of energetic ions is a powerful and versatile tool to fabricate\nthree-dimensional micro-mechanical structures. In this context, it is of\nparamount importance to have an accurate knowledge of the effects of\nion-induced structural damage on the mechanical properties of this material,\nfirstly to predict potential undesired side-effects of the ion implantation\nprocess, and possibly to tailor the desired mechanical properties of the\nfabricated devices. We present an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)\ncharacterization of free-standing cantilevers in single-crystal diamond\nobtained by a FIB-assisted lift-off technique, which allows a determination of\nthe Young's modulus of the diamond crystal after the MeV ion irradiation\nprocess concurrent to the fabrication of the microstructures, and subsequent\nthermal annealing. The AFM measurements were performed with the beam-bending\ntechnique and show that the thermal annealing process allows for an effective\nrecovery of the mechanical properties of the pristine crystal.\n", "  In this paper we present a theoretical calculation of the charge carrier\nmobility in two different dendrimeric melt system (Dendritic phenyl azomethine\nwith Triphenyl amine core and Dendritic Carbazole with Cyclic Phenylazomethine\nas core), which have recently been reported1 to increase the efficiency of\nDye-Sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by interface modification. Our mobility\ncalculation, which is a combination of molecular dynamics simulation, first\nprinciples calculation and kinetic Monte Carlo simulation, leads to mobilities\nthat are in quantitative agreement with available experimental data. We also\nshow how the mobility depends on the dendrimer generation. Furthermore, we\nexamine the variation of mobility with external electric field and external\nreorganization energy. Physical mechanisms behind observed electric field and\ngeneration dependencies of mobility are also explored.\n", "  We report on the structural modifications induced by a lambda = 532 nm\nns-pulsed high-power laser on sub-superficial graphitic layers in\nsingle-crystal diamond realized by means of MeV ion implantation. A systematic\ncharacterization of the structures obtained under different laser irradiation\nconditions (power density, number of pulses) and subsequent thermal annealing\nwas performed by different electron microscopy techniques. The main feature\nobserved after laser irradiation is the thickening of the pre-existing\ngraphitic layer. Cross sectional SEM imaging was performed to directly measure\nthe thickness of the modified layers, and subsequent selective etching of the\nburied layers was employed to both assess their graphitic nature and enhance\nthe SEM imaging contrast. In particular, it was found that for optimal\nirradiation parameters the laser processing induces a six-fold increase the\nthickness of sub superficial graphitic layers without inducing mechanical\nfailures in the surrounding crystal. TEM microscopy and EELS spectroscopy\nallowed a detailed analysis of the internal structure of the laser irradiated\nlayers, highlighting the presence of different nano graphitic and amorphous\nlayers. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of\nhigh-power laser irradiation for an accurate tuning of the geometrical and\nstructural features of graphitic structures embedded in single crystal diamond,\nand open new opportunities in diamond fabrication.\n", "  In the recent years graphitization of ion-beam induced amorphous layers\nbecame the basic tool for device fabrication in diamond. The etchable graphitic\nlayers can be removed to form free-standing membranes into which the desired\nstructures can be sculpted using FIB milling. The optical properties of the\ndevices fabricated using this method are assumed on the model of sharp\ndiamond-air interface. The real quality of this interface could depend on\ndegree of graphitization of the amorphous damage layers after annealing. In the\npresent work the graphitization process was studied using conventional and\nanalytical TEM. It was found that annealing at 550 {\\deg}C results in a partial\ngraphitization of the implanted volume with formation of the nano-crystalline\ngraphitic phase sandwiched between layers of tetrahedral amorphous carbon.\nAnnealing at 1400 {\\deg}C resulted in complete graphitization of the amorphous\nlayers. The average size of graphite nano-crystals did not exceed 5 nm with\npredominant orientation of c-planes normal to the sample surface.\n", "  Micro-fabrication in diamond is involved in a wide set of emerging\ntechnologies, exploiting the exceptional characteristics of diamond for\napplication in bio-physics, photonics, radiation detection. Micro ion-beam\nirradiation and pulsed laser irradiation are complementary techniques, which\npermit the implementation of complex geometries, by modification and\nfunctionalization of surface and/or bulk material, modifying the optical,\nelectrical and mechanical characteristics of the material. In this article we\nsummarize the work done in Florence (Italy) concerning ion beam and pulsed\nlaser beam micro-fabrication in diamond.\n", "  In this work, we present an investigation by Kelvin Probe Microscopy (KPM) of\nburied graphitic microchannels fabricated in single-crystal diamond by direct\nMeV ion microbeam writing. Metal deposition of variable-thickness masks was\nadopted to implant channels with emerging endpoints and high temperature\nannealing was performed in order to induce the graphitization of the\nhighly-damaged buried region. When an electrical current was flowing through\nthe biased buried channel, the structure was clearly evidenced by KPM maps of\nthe electrical potential of the surface region overlying the channel at\nincreasing distances from the grounded electrode. The KPM profiling shows\nregions of opposite contrast located at different distances from the endpoints\nof the channel. This effect is attributed to the different electrical\nconduction properties of the surface and of the buried graphitic layer. The\nmodel adopted to interpret these KPM maps and profiles proved to be suitable\nfor the electronic characterization of buried conductive channels, providing a\nnon-invasive method to measure the local resistivity with a micrometer\nresolution. The results demonstrate the potential of the technique as a\npowerful diagnostic tool to monitor the functionality of all-carbon\ngraphite/diamond devices to be fabricated by MeV ion beam lithography.\n", "  Single-photon sources represent a key enabling technology in quantum optics,\nand single colour centres in diamond are a promising platform to serve this\npurpose, due to their high quantum efficiency and photostability at room\ntemperature. The widely studied nitrogen vacancy centres are characterized by\nseveral limitations, thus other defects have recently been considered, with a\nspecific focus of centres emitting in the Near Infra-Red. In the present work,\nwe report on the coupling of native near-infrared-emitting centres in\nhigh-quality single crystal diamond with Solid Immersion Lens structures\nfabricated by Focused Ion Beam lithography. The reported improvements in terms\nof light collection efficiency make the proposed system an ideal platform for\nthe development of single-photon emitters with appealing photophysical and\nspectral properties.\n", "  In this work, a single crystal CVD diamond film with a novel\nthree-dimensional (3D) interdigitated electrode geometry has been fabricated\nwith the Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) technique in order to increase the charge\ncollection efficiency (CCE) with respect to that obtained by standard\nsuperficial electrodes. The geometrical arrangement of the electric field lines\ndue to the 3D patterning of the electrodes results in a shorter travel path for\nthe excess charge carriers, thus contributing to a more efficient charge\ncollection mech-anism. The CCE of the device was mapped by means of the Ion\nBeam Induced Charge (IBIC) technique. A 1 MeV proton micro-beam was raster\nscanned over the active area of the diamond detector under different bias\nvoltage conditions, enabling to probe the charge transport properties of the\ndetector up to a depth of 8 {\\mu}m below the sample surface. The experimental\nresults, supported by the numerical simulations, show a significant improvement\nin the 3D-detector performance (i.e. CCE, energy resolution, extension of the\nactive area) if compared with the results obtained by standard surface metallic\nelectrodes.\n", "  Einstein's relativity theory demands that all meaningful physical objects\nshould be defined covariantly, i.e. in a coordinate independent way. Concepts\nof relative velocity, acceleration, gravity acceleration and gravity potential\nare fundamental in Newton's theory and they are imprinted in everyone's\nphysical intuition. Unfortunately, relativistic definitions of them are not\ncommonly known or appreciated. Every now and then some confused authors use\nwrong, non-covariant, definitions of velocity, acceleration and gravity, based\non their vague Newtonian intuitions and hidden in a superficial, often purely\nsemantic, relativistic disguise. A recent example of such a confusion (Gorkavyi\n& Vasilkov, 2016) is discussed at the end of this Note.\n", "  Ion implantation is widely used to modify the structural, electrical and\noptical properties of materials. By appropriate masking, this technique can be\nused to define nano- and micro-structures. However, depending on the type of\nmask used, experiments have shown that vacancy-related substrate modification\ncan be inferred tens of microns away from the edge of the mask used to define\nthe implanted region. This could be due to fast diffusion of vacancies from the\nimplanted area during annealing or to a geometric effect related to ion\nscattering around the mask edges. For quantum and single-atom devices, stray\nion damage can be deleterious and must be minimized. In order to profile the\ndistribution of implantation-induced damage, we have used the nitrogen-vacancy\ncolour centre as a sensitive marker for vacancy concentration and distribution\nfollowing MeV He ion implantation into diamond and annealing. Results show that\nhelium atoms implanted through a mask clamped to the diamond surface are\nscattered underneath the mask to distances in the range of tens of micrometers\nfrom the mask edge. Implantation through a lithographically defined and\ndeposited mask, with no spacing between the mask and the substrate,\nsignificantly reduces the scattering to <5 m but does not eliminate it. These\nscattering distances are much larger than the theoretically estimated vacancy\ndiffusion distance of 260 nm under similar conditions. This paper shows that\ndiffusion, upon annealing, of vacancies created by ion implantation in diamond\nis limited and the appearance of vacancies many tens of micrometers from the\nedge of the mask is due to scattering effects.\n", "  A method for obtaining a smooth, single crystal diamond surface is presented,\nwhereby a sacrificial defective layer is created by implantation and\ngraphitized by annealing before being selectively etched. We have used O+ at\n240 keV, the main process variables being the ion fluence (ranging from 3x10^15\ncm^-2 to 3x10^17 cm^-2) and the final etching process (wet etch, H2 plasma and\nannealing in air). The substrates were characterized by atomic force\nmicroscopy, optical profilometry and white beam X-ray topography. The influence\nof the various process parameters on the resulting lift-off efficiency and\nfinal surface roughness is discussed. An O+ fluence of 2x10^17 cm^-2 was found\nto result in sub-nanometre roughness over tens of um^2.\n", "  Primes in the two complete associative normed division algebras C and H have\naffinities with structures seen in the standard model of particle physics. On\nthe integers in the two algebras, there are two equivalence relations: a strong\none, related to a U(1) and SU(3) symmetry allowing to permute and switch signs\nof the coordinates of the integers, as well as a weak relation with origins\nfrom units U(1),SU(2) in the algebra. Weak equivalence classes within the\nstrong equivalence classes of odd primes in C case relate to leptons, the inert\nones being neutrino like, and the split ones resembling electron-positron\npairs. In the H case, for odd primes, the equivalence classes come in groups of\ntwo or three, leading to a caricature of hadrons featuring either mesons built\nby a quark pair or then baryons obtained by quark triplets. We can now list for\nevery rational prime p all these particles and attach fractional charges to its\nconstituents.\n", "  We present experimental results and numerical simulations to investigate the\nmodification of structural-mechanical properties of ion-implanted\nsingle-crystal diamond. A phenomenological model is used to derive an\nanalytical expression for the variation of mass density and elastic properties\nas a function of damage density in the crystal. These relations are applied\ntogether with SRIM Monte Carlo simulations to set up Finite Element simulations\nfor the determination of internal strains and surface deformation of\nMeV-ion-implanted diamond samples. The results are validated through comparison\nwith high resolution X-ray diffraction and white-light interferometric\nprofilometry experiments. The former are carried out on 180 keV B implanted\ndiamond samples, to determine the induced structural variation, in terms of\nlattice spacing and disorder, whilst the latter are performed on 1.8 MeV He\nimplanted diamond samples to measure surface swelling. The effect of thermal\nprocessing on the evolution of the structural-mechanical properties of damaged\ndiamond is also evaluated by performing the same profilometric measurements\nafter annealing at 1000 {\\deg}C, and modeling the obtained trends with a\nsuitably modified analytical model. The results allow the development of a\ncoherent model describing the effects of MeV-ion-induced damage on the\nstructural-mechanical properties of single-crystal diamond. In particular, we\nsuggest a more reliable method to determine the so-called diamond\n\"graphitization threshold\" for the considered implantation type.\n", "  As part of a project to better characterize comparatively bright but so far\nlittle studied cataclysmic variables in the southern hemisphere, we have\nobtained spectroscopic and photometric data of the nova-like variables LS IV\n-08$^{\\rm o}$ 3 and HQ Mon, and of the Z Cam type dwarf nova ST Cha. The\nspectra of all systems are as expected for their respective types. We derive\nimproved orbital ephemeris of LS IV -08$^{\\rm o}$ 3 and map its accretion disk\nin the light of the H$\\alpha$ emission using Doppler tomography. We find that\nthe emission has a two component origin, arising in the outer parts of the\naccretion disk and possibly on the illuminated face of the secondary star. The\nlight curve of LS IV -08$^{\\rm o}$ 3 exhibits a low level of flickering and\nindications for a modulation on the orbital period. Spectroscopy of HQ Mon\nsuggests an orbital period of $\\approx$5.15 hours which is incompatible with\nprevious (uncertain) estimates. The light curves show the typical low scale\nflickering of UX UMa type nova-like systems, superposed upon variations on\nlonger time scales. During one night a modulation with a period of $\\approx$41\nmin is observed, visible for at least 4 hours. However, it does not repeat\nitself in other nights. A spectroscopic orbital period of $\\approx$5.5 hours is\nderived for ST Cha. A previously suspected period of 6.8 hours (or\nalternatively 9.6 hours), based on historical photographic photometry is\nincompatible with the spectroscopic period. Moreover, we show that our new as\nwell as previous photometry does not contain evidence for the quoted\nphotometric period.\n", "  Diamond displays a large variety of luminescence centers which define its\noptical properties and can be either created or modified by irradiation. The\nmain purpose of the present work is to study the radiation hardness of several\nof such centers in homoepitaxial single crystal CVD diamond by following the\nevolution of photoluminescence and ionoluminescence upon 2 MeV proton\nirradiation. Luminescence decays were observed with values of the fluence at\nhalf of the starting luminescence (F1/2) of the order of 1014 cm-2. The 3H\ncenter displayed a non monotonic behavior, with a growing behavior and a\nsubsequent decay with a rather high F1/2 value (in the order of few 1016 cm-2),\nmaintaining at the highest fluences an intensity significantly higher than the\nblue A-band. A simple model based on a double-exponential trend was defined to\nfit with satisfactory accuracy the evolution of the 3H center. Several PL\ncenters (namely: 3H, TR12, 491 nm, 494 nm) exhibited clear correlations and\nanti-correlations in their fluence dependences, which were considered in the\nattempt to acquire some insight into their possible alternative attributions.\n", "  The absence of any signal of supersymmetry (SUSY) at the LHC has raised the\nSUSY particle mass scale compared to $Z$ boson mass $M_Z$. We investigate the\nnaturalness of the electroweak symmetry breaking after considering radiative\nsymmetry breaking along with 125 GeV Higgs mass. We find that the important\nquantity to measure the naturalness of the hierarchy between the SUSY scale and\n$M_Z$ is the separation between the radiative symmetry breaking scale, i.e.,\nwhere $m_{H_u}^2+\\mu^2$ turns negative for large $\\tan\\beta$ case ($\\mu$ is the\nHiggsino mass and $m_{H_u}$ is the SUSY breaking up-type Higgs boson mass) and\nthe average stop mass. Using this measure, one can show that the electroweak\nsymmetry breaking can be natural even if $\\mu$ is large contrary to the\nprevailing claim that $\\mu$ is needed to be small to maintain the naturalness.\n", "  This short note describes the long collaborative effort between Arizona and\nKrak\\'ow, showing some of the key strangeness signatures of quark-gluon plasma.\nIt further presents an annotated catalog of foundational questions defining the\nresearch frontiers which I believe can be addressed in the foreseeable future\nin the context of relativistic heavy ion collision experiments. The list\nincludes topics that are specific to the field, and ventures towards the\nknown-to-be-unknown that may have a better chance with ions as compared to\nelementary interactions.\n", "  The actinide elemental metals are scare, often toxic and radio active,\ncausing challenges for both experiments and theory while offering fascinating\nphysics. For practical purposes they are the prevalent building blocks for\nmaterials where nuclear properties are of interest. Here, however, we are\nfocusing on fundamental properties of the actinides related to their electronic\nstructure and characteristic bonding in the condensed state. The series of\nactinides is naturally divided into two segments. First, the set of lighter\nactinides thorium through plutonium, often referred to as the early actinides,\ndisplay variations of their atomic volume reminiscent of transition metals\nsuggesting a gradual occupation of bonding 5f states. Second, the heavier (or\nlate) actinides, Am and onwards, demonstrate a volume behavior comparable to\nthe rare-earth metals thus implying nonbonding 5f states. Arguably, one can\ndistinguish plutonium metal as special case lying between these two subsets\nbecause it shares some features from both. Therefore, we discuss the early\nactinides, plutonium metal, and the late actinides separately applying\nfirst-principles density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations. The analysis\nincludes successes and failures of the theory to describe primarily phase\nstability, bonding, and electronic structure.\n", "  For the ideal Fermi gas that fills a quantum well confined by two parallel\nplanes, there are calculated the thermodynamic characteristics in general form\nfor arbitrary temperatures, namely: the thermodynamic potential, energy,\nentropy, equations of state, heat capacities and compressibilities. The\ndistance between planes is considered as an additional thermodynamic variable.\nOwing to the anisotropy, the pressure of the Fermi gas along and transverse to\nthe planes is different, so that the system is characterized by two equations\nof state and a set of different heat capacities. Limiting cases of low and high\ntemperatures are considered. The temperature dependencies of the entropy and\nheat capacities at low temperatures remain linear, just as in the volume case,\nand their dependencies on the chemical potential and density undergo jumps at\nthe beginning of the filling of new discrete levels. It is shown that the\nbehavior of thermodynamic quantities with the distance between plates can be\neither oscillating or monotonic, depending on what quantity is assumed to be\nfixed: the volume or surface density. For high temperatures the corrections to\nthermodynamic quantities are obtained, which are proportional to the ratio of\nthe thermal de Broglie wavelength to the distance between planes.\n", "  We investigate the prospects and consequences of the spectral level\nreconstruction of primordial $B$-mode power by solving the systems of linear\nequations assuming that the lensing potential together with the lensed\npolarization spectra are already in hand. We find that this reconstruction\ntechnique may be very useful to have an estimate of the amplitude of primordial\ngravity waves or more specifically the value of tensor to scalar ratio. We also\nsee that one can have cosmic variance limited reconstruction of the intrinsic\n$B$-mode power up to few hundred multipoles ($\\ell\\sim500$) which is more than\nsufficient to have an estimate of the tensor to scalar ratio. Since the small\nscale cosmic microwave background (CMB henceforth) anisotropies are not sourced\nby the primordial gravity waves generated during inflation. We also find that\nthe impact of instrumental noise may be bypassed within this reconstruction\nalgorithm. A simple demonstration for the nullification of the instrumental\nnoise anticipating COrE like futuristic space mission complemented with Planck\n2013 cosmology has been presented.\n", "  We report a high-pressure high-temperature synthesis of several\nmillimeter-sized samples of bulk graphanes with the composition C-H(D) from\nbenzene and graphene-derivative C-H-N$_{0.2}$ from pyridine. X-ray diffraction,\ntransmission electron microscopy, and infrared spectroscopy of new materials\nreveal relatively large (several nanometers in size) crystalline grains of an\nsp3-bonded graphane lattice (3-cycle-4-step, the orthorhombic structure with\nPbca space group and parameters a = 9.5-9.8, b = 8.9-9.1, c = 17.1-17.3 $\\AA$).\nThe main hydrogen groups in samples are C-H groups connected by aliphatic\nbonds. The synthesized graphanes at atmospheric pressure are stable up to 500\nC. The macroscopic density of CH samples is 1.5-1.57 g cm$^{-3} $ and the\nrefractive index is 1.78-1.80. The absorption spectra of samples with a high\ndegree of crystallization exhibits a weak absorption maximum at 2.8 eV, which\nis responsible for the yellow-orange color, large absorption maximum at 4 eV\nand an absorption edge associated with the width of the optical gap at 5.2 eV.\nThe bulk modulus (30-37 GPa) and shear modulus (15-18 GPa) of the fabricated\nsamples, as well as their hardness (1-1.5 GPa), are about twice as high as the\nrespective values for polycrystalline graphite. The solution of metalorganic\ncomplexes in benzene and pyridine makes it possible to obtain doped graphanes,\nwhich can have extraordinary electron transport and magnetic properties.\n", "  Recent observations suggest ongoing planet formation in the innermost parsec\nof the Galactic center (GC). The super-massive black hole (SMBH) might strip\nplanets or planetary embryos from their parent star, bringing them close enough\nto be tidally disrupted. Photoevaporation by the ultraviolet field of young\nstars, combined with ongoing tidal disruption, could enhance the near-infrared\nluminosity of such starless planets, making their detection possible even with\ncurrent facilities. In this paper, we investigate the chance of planet tidal\ncaptures by means of high-accuracy N-body simulations exploiting Mikkola's\nalgorithmic regularization. We consider both planets lying in the clockwise\n(CW) disk and planets initially bound to the S-stars. We show that tidally\ncaptured planets remain on orbits close to those of their parent star.\nMoreover, the semi-major axis of the planet orbit can be predicted by simple\nanalytic assumptions in the case of prograde orbits. We find that starless\nplanets that were initially bound to CW disk stars have mild eccentricities and\ntend to remain in the CW disk. However, we speculate that angular momentum\ndiffusion and scattering with other young stars in the CW disk might bring\nstarless planets on low-angular momentum orbits. In contrast, planets initially\nbound to S-stars are captured by the SMBH on highly eccentric orbits, matching\nthe orbital properties of the G1 and G2 clouds. Our predictions apply not only\nto planets but also to low-mass stars initially bound to the S-stars and\ntidally captured by the SMBH.\n", "  2D and 3D micro/nano fabrication based on two-photon polymerization (TPP) has\nemerged as a strong contender for additive manufacturing for wide variety of\napplications. In this manuscript we report one step patterning of structurally\nstable, subwavelength 2D and 3D gold nanostructures using femto-second laser by\nincorporating single photon photoinitiator only in pure and metal precursor\ndoped polymers. The metal polymer composite nanostructures are written directly\nby in-situ reduction of gold precursor within the photoresist using\nfemto-second laser irradiation. The photo-initiator triggers the reduction of\ngold precursor and induces simultaneous polymerization of the photoresist based\non two-photon absorption phenomenon. Diffraction gratings with varied loading\nof gold precursors in photoresist have been fabricated and characterized by\nmeasuring their diffraction efficiencies in the infrared region. Minimum line\nwidth of 390 nm has been achieved for 5 wt% gold loaded polymers. Systematic\nstudies of the effect of laser power, metal precursor loading etc. on the\nline-widths have also been performed. These investigations are expected to pave\nway for exploration of new material combinations for development of simple\nfabrication for fabrication of metal composite functional structures at\nsignificantly low cost and with high-throughput.\n", "  We study dynamically crowded solutions of stiff fibers deep in the semidilute\nregime, where the motion of a single constituent becomes increasingly confined\nto a narrow tube. The spatiotemporal dynamics for wave numbers resolving the\nmotion in the confining tube becomes accessible in Brownian dynamics\nsimulations upon employing a geometry-adapted neighbor list. We demonstrate\nthat in such crowded environments the intermediate scattering function,\ncharacterizing the motion in space and time, can be predicted quantitatively by\nsimulating a single freely diffusing phantom needle only, yet with very unusual\ndiffusion coefficients.\n", "  Among solutions of the strong CP problem, the \"invisible\" axion in the narrow\naxion window is argued to be the remaining possibility among natural solutions\non the smallness of $\\bar{\\theta}$. Related to the gravity spoil of global\nsymmetries, some prospective invisible axions from theory point of view are\ndiscussed. In all these discussions, including the observational possibility,\ncosmological constraints must be included.\n", "  An ontology of Leibnizian relationalism, consisting in distance relations\namong sparse matter points and their change only, is well recognized as a\nserious option in the context of classical mechanics. In this paper, we\ninvestigate how this ontology fares when it comes to general relativistic\nphysics. Using a Humean strategy, we regard the gravitational field as a means\nto represent the overall change in the distance relations among point particles\nin a way that achieves the best combination of being simple and being\ninformative.\n", "  Proxima Centauri b, an Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of our nearest\nstellar neighbour, has just been discovered. A theoretical framework of\nsynchronously rotating planets, in which the risk of a runaway greenhouse on\nthe sunlight side and atmospheric collapse on the reverse side are mutually\nameliorated via heat transport is discussed. This is developed via simple\n(tutorial) models of the climate. These show that lower incident stellar flux\nmeans that less heat transport, so less atmospheric mass, is required. The\nincident stellar flux at Proxima Centauri b is indeed low, which may help\nenhance habitability if it has suffered some atmospheric loss or began with a\nlow volatile inventory.\n", "  Gieseker-Nakajima moduli spaces $M_{k}(n)$ parametrize the charge $k$\nnoncommutative $U(n)$ instantons on ${\\bf R}^{4}$ and framed rank $n$ torsion\nfree sheaves $\\mathcal{E}$ on ${\\bf C\\bf P}^{2}$ with ${\\rm\nch}_{2}({\\mathcal{E}}) = k$. They also serve as local models of the moduli\nspaces of instantons on general four-manifolds. We study the generalization of\ngauge theory in which the four dimensional spacetime is a stratified space $X$\nimmersed into a Calabi-Yau fourfold $Z$. The local model ${\\bf M}_{k}({\\vec\nn})$ of the corresponding instanton moduli space is the moduli space of charge\n$k$ (noncommutative) instantons on origami spacetimes. There, $X$ is modelled\non a union of (up to six) coordinate complex planes ${\\bf C}^{2}$ intersecting\nin $Z$ modelled on ${\\bf C}^{4}$. The instantons are shared by the collection\nof four dimensional gauge theories sewn along two dimensional defect surfaces\nand defect points. We also define several quiver versions ${\\bf M}_{\\bf\nk}^{\\gamma}({\\vec{\\bf n}})$ of ${\\bf M}_{k}({\\vec n})$, motivated by the\nconsiderations of sewn gauge theories on orbifolds ${\\bf C}^{4}/{\\Gamma}$.\n  The geometry of the spaces ${\\bf M}_{\\bf k}^{\\gamma}({\\vec{\\bf n}})$, more\nspecifically the compactness of the set of torus-fixed points, for various\ntori, underlies the non-perturbative Dyson-Schwinger identities recently found\nto be satisfied by the correlation functions of $qq$-characters viewed as local\ngauge invariant operators in the ${\\mathcal{N}}=2$ quiver gauge theories.\n  The cohomological and K-theoretic operations defined using ${\\bf M}_{k}({\\vec\nn})$ and their quiver versions as correspondences provide the geometric\ncounterpart of the $qq$-characters, line and surface defects.\n", "  We report on the evidence for the multiband electronic transport in\n$\\alpha$-YbAlB$_{4}$ and $\\alpha$-Yb$_{0.81(2)}$Sr$_{0.19(3)}$AlB$_{4}$.\nMultiband transport reveals itself below 10 K in both compounds via Hall effect\nmeasurements, whereas anisotropic magnetic ground state sets in below 3 K in\n$\\alpha$-Yb$_{0.81(2)}$Sr$_{0.19(3)}$AlB$_{4}$. Our results show that Sr$^{2+}$\nsubstitution enhances conductivity, but does not change the quasiparticle mass\nof bands induced by heavy fermion hybridization.\n", "  SCUBA-2, which replaces SCUBA (the Submillimeter Common User Bolometer Array)\non the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) in 2006, is a large-format\nbolometer array for submillimeter astronomy. Unlike previous detectors which\nhave used discrete bolometers, SCUBA-2 has two dc-coupled, monolithic, filled\narrays with a total of ~10,000 bolometers. It will offer simultaneous imaging\nof a 50 sq-arcmin field of view at wavelengths of 850 and 450 microns. SCUBA-2\nis expected to have a huge impact on the study of galaxy formation and\nevolution in the early Universe as well as star and planet formation in our own\nGalaxy. Mapping the sky to the same S/N up to 1000 times faster than SCUBA, it\nwill also act as a pathfinder for the new submillimeter interferometers such as\nALMA. SCUBA-2's absorber-coupled pixels use superconducting transition edge\nsensors operating at 120 mK for performance limited by the sky background\nphoton noise. The monolithic silicon detector arrays are deep-etched by the\nBosch process to isolate the pixels on silicon nitride membranes. Electrical\nconnections are made through indium bump bonds to a SQUID time-domain\nmultiplexer (MUX). We give an overview of the SCUBA-2 system and an update on\nits status, and describe some of the technological innovations that make this\nunique instrument possible.\n", "  CLOVER is an experiment which aims to detect the signature of gravitational\nwaves from inflation by measuring the B-mode polarization of the cosmic\nmicrowave background. CLOVER consists of three telescopes operating at 97, 150,\nand 220 GHz. The 97-GHz telescope has 160 horns in its focal plane while the\n150 and 220-GHz telescopes have 256 horns each. The horns are arranged in a\nhexagonal array and feed a polarimeter which uses finline-coupled TES\nbolometers as detectors. To detect the two polarizations the 97-GHz telescope\nhas 320 detectors while the 150 and 220-GHz telescopes have 512 detectors each.\nTo achieve the required NEPs the detectors are cooled to 100 mK for the 97 and\n150-GHz polarimeters and 230 mK for the 220-GHz polarimeter. Each detector is\nfabricated as a single chip to guarantee fully functioning focal planes. The\ndetectors are contained in linear modules made of copper which form split-block\nwaveguides. The detector modules contain 16 or 20 detectors each for\ncompatibility with the hexagonal arrays of horns in the telescopes' focal\nplanes. Each detector module contains a time-division SQUID multiplexer to read\nout the detectors. Further amplification of the multiplexed signals is provided\nby SQUID series arrays. The first prototype detectors for CLOVER operate with a\nbath temperature of 230 mK and are used to validate the detector design as well\nas the polarimeter technology. We describe the design of the CLOVER detectors,\ndetector blocks, and readout, and give an update on the detector development.\n"]}
