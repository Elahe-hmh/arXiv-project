The required stabilizing\nalgebra depends on whether the system is well-removed from equilibrium or near\nequilibrium. This paper introduces a quantitative distinction between these two\nregimes and addresses the former case in depth, presenting explicit asymptotic\nmethods appropriate when the system is extremely stiff but only weakly\nequilibrated. A second paper examines quasi-steady-state methods as an\nalternative to asymptotic methods in systems well away from equilibrium and a\nthird paper extends these methods to equilibrium conditions in extremely stiff\nsystems using partial equilibrium methods. All three papers present systematic\nevidence for timesteps competitive with implicit methods. Because an explicit\nmethod can execute a timestep faster than an implicit method,\nalgebraically-stabilized explicit algorithms might permit integration of larger\nnetworks than have been feasible before in various disciplines.\n", "  In two preceding papers we have shown that, when reaction networks are\nwell-removed from equilibrium, explicit asymptotic and quasi-steady-state\napproximations can give algebraically-stabilized integration schemes that rival\nstandard implicit methods in accuracy and speed for extremely stiff systems.\nHowever, we also showed that these explicit methods remain accurate but are no\nlonger competitive in speed as the network approaches equilibrium. In this\npaper we analyze this failure and show that it is associated with the presence\nof fast equilibration timescales that neither asymptotic nor quasi-steady-state\napproximations are able to remove efficiently from the numerical integration.\nBased on this understanding, we develop a partial equilibrium method to deal\neffectively with the approach to equilibrium and show that explicit asymptotic\nmethods, combined with the new partial equilibrium methods, give an integration\nscheme that plausibly can deal with the stiffest networks, even in the approach\nto equilibrium, with accuracy and speed competitive with that of implicit\nmethods. Thus we demonstrate that such explicit methods may offer alternatives\nto implicit integration of even extremely stiff systems, and that these methods\nmay permit integration of much larger networks than have been possible before\nin a number of fields.\n", "  A preceding paper demonstrated that explicit asymptotic methods generally\nwork much better for extremely stiff reaction networks than has previously been\nshown in the literature. There we showed that for systems well removed from\nequilibrium explicit asymptotic methods can rival standard implicit codes in\nspeed and accuracy for solving extremely stiff differential equations. In this\npaper we continue the investigation of systems well removed from equilibrium by\nexamining quasi-steady-state (QSS) methods as an alternative to asymptotic\nmethods. We show that for systems well removed from equilibrium, QSS methods\nalso can compete with, or even exceed, standard implicit methods in speed, even\nfor extremely stiff networks, and in many cases give somewhat better\nintegration speed than for asymptotic methods. As for asymptotic methods, we\nwill find that QSS methods give correct results, but with non-competitive\nintegration speed as equilibrium is approached. Thus, we shall find that both\nasymptotic and QSS methods must be supplemented with partial equilibrium\nmethods as equilibrium is approached to remain competitive with implicit\nmethods.\n", "  In contrast to the prevailing view in the literature, it is shown that even\nextremely stiff sets of ordinary differential equations may be solved\nefficiently by explicit methods if limiting algebraic solutions are used to\nstabilize the numerical integration. The stabilizing algebra differs\nessentially for systems well-removed from equilibrium and those near\nequilibrium. Explicit asymptotic and quasi-steady-state methods that are\nappropriate when the system is only weakly equilibrated are examined first.\nThese methods are then extended to the case of close approach to equilibrium\nthrough a new implementation of partial equilibrium approximations. Using\nstringent tests with astrophysical thermonuclear networks, evidence is provided\nthat these methods can deal with the stiffest networks, even in the approach to\nequilibrium, with accuracy and integration timestepping comparable to that of\nimplicit methods. Because explicit methods can execute a timestep faster and\nscale more favorably with network size than implicit algorithms, our results\nsuggest that algebraically-stabilized explicit methods might enable integration\nof larger reaction networks coupled to fluid dynamics than has been feasible\npreviously for a variety of disciplines.\n", "  For complete affine manifolds we introduce a definition of compactification\nbased on the projective differential geometry (i.e.\\ geodesic path data) of the\ngiven connection. The definition of projective compactness involves a real\nparameter $\\alpha$ called the order of projective compactness. For volume\npreserving connections, this order is captured by a notion of volume\nasymptotics that we define. These ideas apply to complete pseudo-Riemannian\nspaces, via the Levi-Civita connection, and thus provide a notion of\ncompactification alternative to conformal compactification. For each order\n$\\alpha$, we provide an asymptotic form of a metric which is sufficient for\nprojective compactness of the given order, thus also providing many local\nexamples.\n  Distinguished classes of projectively compactified geometries of orders one\nand two are associated with Ricci-flat connections and non--Ricci--flat\nEinstein metrics, respectively. Conversely, these geometric conditions are\nshown to force the indicated order of projective compactness. These special\ncompactifications are shown to correspond to normal solutions of classes of\nnatural linear PDE (so-called first BGG equations), or equivalently holonomy\nreductions of projective Cartan/tractor connections. This enables the\napplication of tools already available to reveal considerable information about\nthe geometry of the boundary at infinity. Finally, we show that metrics\nadmitting such special compactifications always have an asymptotic form as\nmentioned above.\n", "  The foundations of Statistical Mechanics can be recovered almost in their\nentirety from the Principle of Maximum Entropy. In this work we show that its\nnon-equilibrium generalization, the Principle of Maximum Caliber (Jaynes,\n1980), when applied to the unknown trajectory followed by a particle, leads to\nNewton's second law under two quite intuitive assumptions (the expected square\ndisplacement in one step and the spatial probability distribution of the\nparticle are known at all times). Our derivation explicitly highlights the role\nof mass as an emergent measure of the fluctuations in velocity (inertia) and\nthe origin of potential energy as a manifestation of spatial correlations.\nAccording to our findings, the application of Newton's equations is not limited\nto mechanical systems, and therefore could be used in modelling ecological,\nfinancial and biological systems, among others.\n", "  We present a methodology for fitting interatomic potentials to ab initio\ndata, using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, needing only a set\nof positions and energies as input. The prediction error of energies associated\nwith the fitted parameters can be close to 1 meV/atom or lower, for reference\nenergies having a standard deviation of about 0.5 eV/atom. We tested our method\nby fitting a Sutton-Chen potential for copper from \\emph{ab initio} data, which\nis able to recover structural and dynamical properties, and obtain a better\nagreement of the predicted melting point versus the experimental value, as\ncompared to the prediction of the standard Sutton-Chen parameters.\n", "  Maximization of the path information entropy is a clear prescription for\nconstructing models in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Here it is shown\nthat, following this prescription under the assumption of arbitrary\ninstantaneous constraints on position and velocity, a Lagrangian emerges which\ndetermines the most probable trajectory. Deviations from the probability\nmaximum can be consistently described as slices in time by a Hamiltonian,\naccording to a nonlinear Langevin equation and its associated Fokker-Planck\nequation. The connections unveiled between the maximization of path entropy and\nthe Langevin/Fokker-Planck equations imply that missing information about the\nphase space coordinate never decreases in time, a purely\ninformation-theoretical version of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. All of\nthese results are independent of any physical assumptions, and thus valid for\nany generalized coordinate as a function of time, or any other parameter. This\nreinforces the view that the Second Law is a fundamental property of plausible\ninference.\n", "  The formalism used in describing the thermodynamics of abrupt (or\nfirst-order) phase transitions is reviewed as an application of maximum entropy\ninference. In this treatment, we show that the concepts of transition\ntemperature, latent heat and entropy difference between phases will inevitably\nhave an equivalent in any problem of inferring the result of a yes/no question,\ngiven information in the form of expectation values.\n", "  The effect of line overlap in the Lyman and Werner bands, often ignored in\ngalactic studies of the atomic-to-molecular transition, greatly enhances\nmolecular hydrogen self-shielding in low metallicity environments, and\ndominates over dust shielding for metallicities below about 10% solar. We\nimplement that effect in cosmological hydrodynamics simulations with an\nempirical model, calibrated against the observational data, and provide fitting\nformulae for the molecular hydrogen fraction as a function of gas density on\nvarious spatial scales and in environments with varied dust abundance and\ninterstellar radiation field. We find that line overlap, while important for\ndetailed radiative transfer in the Lyman and Werner bands, has only a minor\neffect on star formation on galactic scales, which, to a much larger degree, is\nregulated by stellar feedback.\n", "  We investigate synchronization in networks of Kuramoto oscillators with\ninertia. More specifically, we introduce a rewiring algorithm consisting\nbasically in a {\\em hill climb} scheme in which the edges of the network are\nswapped in order to enhance its synchronization capacity. We show that the the\nsynchrony-optimized networks generated by our algorithm have some interesting\ntopological and dynamical properties. In particular, they typically exhibit an\nanticipation of the synchronization onset and are more robust against certain\ntypes of perturbations. We consider synthetic random networks and also a\nnetwork with a topology based in an approximated model of the (high voltage)\npower grid of Spain, since networks of Kuramoto oscillators with inertia have\nbeen used recently as simplified models for power grids, for which\nsynchronization is obviously a crucial issue. Despite the extreme\nsimplifications adopted in these models, our results, among others recently\nobtained in the literature, may provide interesting principles to guide the\nfuture growth and development of real-world grids, specially in the case of a\nchange of the current paradigm of centralized towards distributed generation\npower grids.\n", "  We demonstrate the first implementation of recently-developed fast explicit\nkinetic integration algorithms on modern graphics processing unit (GPU)\naccelerators. Taking as a generic test case a Type Ia supernova explosion with\nan extremely stiff thermonuclear network having 150 isotopic species and 1604\nreactions coupled to hydrodynamics using operator splitting, we demonstrate the\ncapability to solve of order 100 realistic kinetic networks in parallel in the\nsame time that standard implicit methods can solve a single such network on a\nCPU. This orders-of-magnitude decrease in compute time for solving systems of\nrealistic kinetic networks implies that important coupled, multiphysics\nproblems in various scientific and technical fields that were intractible, or\ncould be simulated only with highly schematic kinetic networks, are now\ncomputationally feasible.\n", "  Dense soft glasses show strong collective caging behavior at sufficiently low\ntemperatures. Using molecular dynamics simulations of a model glass former, we\nshow that the incorporation of activity or self-propulsion, f0, can induce cage\nbreaking and fluidization, resulting in a disappearance of the glassy phase\nbeyond a critical f0 . The diffusion coefficient crosses over from being\nstrongly to weakly temperature dependent as f0 is increased. In addition, we\ndemonstrate that activity induces a crossover from a fragile to a strong glass\nand a tendency for clustering of active particles. Our results are of direct\nrelevance to the collective dynamics of dense active colloidal glasses and to\nrecent experiments on tagged particle diffusion in living cells.\n", "  The spectrum of a bound state of three identical particles with a mass $m$ in\na finite cubic box is studied. It is shown that in the unitary limit, the\nenergy shift of a shallow bound state is given by $\\Delta E=c\n(\\kappa^2/m)\\,(\\kappa L)^{-3/2}|A|^2\\exp(-2\\kappa L/\\sqrt{3})$, where $\\kappa$\nis the bound-state momentum, $L$ is the box size, $|A|^2$ denotes the\nthree-body analog of the asymptotic normalization coefficient of the bound\nstate wave function and $c$ is a numerical constant. The formula is valid for\n$\\kappa L\\gg 1$.\n", "  The last few years have seen significant experimental progress in\ncharacterizing the copper-based hole-doped high temperature superconductors in\nthe regime of low hole density, p. Quantum oscillations, NMR, X-ray, and STM\nexperiments have shed much light on the nature of the ordering at low\ntemperatures. We review evidence that the order parameter in the\nnon-Lanthanum-based cuprates is a d-form factor density-wave. This novel order\nacts as an unexpected window into the electronic structure of the pseudogap\nphase at higher temperatures in zero field: we argue in favor of a\n`fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*) with 4 pockets of spin S=1/2, charge +e\nfermions enclosing an area specified by p.\n", "  We derive the Gauss-Codazzi equation in the holonomy and plane-angle\nrepresentations and we use the result to write a Gauss-Codazzi equation for a\ndiscrete (2+1)-dimensional manifold, triangulated by isosceles tetrahedra. This\nallows us to write operators acting on spin network states in (2+1)-dimensional\nloop quantum gravity, representing the 3-dimensional intrinsic, 2-dimensional\nintrinsic, and 2-dimensional extrinsic curvatures.\n", "  A standard high purity germanium (HPGe) detector was used to determine the\npreviously unknown neutron activity of a weak americium-beryllium (AmBe)\nneutron source. Gamma rays were created through 27Al(n,n'), 27Al(n,gamma) and\n1H(n,gamma) reactions induced by the neutrons on aluminum and acrylic disks,\nrespectively. These gamma rays were measured using the HPGe detector. Given the\nunorthodox experimental arrangement, a Monte Carlo simulation was developed to\nmodel the efficiency of the detector system to determine the neutron activity\nfrom the measured gamma rays. The activity of our neutron source was determined\nto be 307.4 +/- 5.0 n/s and is consistent for the different neutron-induced\ngamma rays.\n", "  Previous studies of the type IIB superstring in an ${AdS_5 \\times S^5}$\nbackground are based on a description of the superspace geometry as the\nquotient space $PSU(2,2|4)/SO(4,1) \\times SO(5)$. This paper develops an\nalternative approach in which the Grassmann coordinates provide a nonlinear\nrealization of $PSU(2,2|4)$ based on the quotient space $PSU(2,2|4)/SU(2,2)\n\\times SU(4)$, and the bosonic coordinates are described as a submanifold of\n$SU(2,2) \\times SU(4)$. This formulation keeps all bosonic symmetries manifest,\nand it provides the complete dependence on the Grassmann coordinates in terms\nof simple analytic expressions. It is used to construct the superstring\nworld-sheet action in a form in which the $PSU(2,2|4)$ symmetry is manifest and\nkappa symmetry can be established. This formulation might have some advantages\ncompared to previous ones, but this remains to be demonstrated.\n", "  The motion of a lazy Pearson walker is studied with different probability\n($p$) of jump in two and three dimensions. The probability of exit ($P_e$) from\na zone of radius $r_e$, is studied as a function of $r_e$ with different values\nof jump probability $p$. The exit probability $P_e$ is found to scale as\n${P_e}p^{\\alpha}=F({r_e}p^{\\beta})$, which is obtained by method of data\ncollapse. The first passage time ($t_1$) i.e., the time required for first exit\nfrom a zone is studied. The probability distribution ($P(t_1)$) of first\npassage time was studied for different values of jump probability ($p$). The\nprobability distribution of first passage time was found to scale as\n${P(t_1)}p^{\\gamma} = G({t_1}p^{\\delta})$. Where, $F$ and $G$ are two scaling\nfunctions and $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$ and $\\delta$ are some exponents. In\nboth the dimensions, it is found that, $\\alpha = 0$, $\\beta=-1/2$, $\\gamma=-1$\nand $\\delta=1$.\n", "  The deflection, potential, shear and magnification of a gravitational lens\nfollowing an elliptical power law mass model are investigated. This mass model\nis derived from the circular power law profile through a rescaling of the axes,\nsimilar to the case of a singular isothermal ellipsoid. The resulting\ndeflection can be calculated explicitly and given in terms of the Gaussian\nhypergeometric function. Analytic expressions for the remaining lensing\nproperties are found as well. Because the power law profile lens contains a\nnumber of well-known lens models as special cases, the equivalence of the new\nexpressions with known results is checked. Finally, it is shown how these\nresults naturally lead to a fast and accurate numerical scheme for computing\nthe deflection and other lens quantities, making this method a useful tool for\nrealistically modelling observed lenses.\n", "  The symmetry of quantum theory under time reversal has long been a subject of\ncontroversy because the transition probabilities given by Born's rule do not\napply backward in time. Here, we resolve this problem within a rigorous\noperational probabilistic framework. We argue that reconciling time reversal\nwith the probabilistic rules of the theory requires a notion of operation that\npermits realizations via both pre- and post-selection. We develop the\ngeneralized formulation of quantum theory that stems from this approach and\ngive a precise definition of time-reversal symmetry, emphasizing a previously\noverlooked distinction between states and effects. We prove an analogue of\nWigner's theorem, which characterizes all allowed symmetry transformations in\nthis operationally time-symmetric quantum theory. Remarkably, we find larger\nclasses of symmetry transformations than those assumed before. This suggests a\npossible direction for search of extensions of known physics.\n", "  Graphene SU(4) quantum Hall symmetry is extended to SO(8), permitting\nanalytical solutions for graphene in a magnetic field that break SU(4)\nspontaneously. We recover standard graphene SU(4) physics as one limit, but\nfind new phases and new properties that may be relevant for understanding the\nground state. The graphene SO(8) symmetry is found to be isomorphic to one that\noccurs extensively in nuclear structure physics, and very similar to one that\ndescribes high-temperature superconductors, suggesting deep mathematical\nconnections among these physically-different fermionic systems.\n", "  Having analytical instances of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH)\nis of obvious interest, both for fundamental and applied reasons. This is\ngenerically a hard task, due to the belief that non-linear interactions are\nbasic ingredients of the thermalization mechanism. In this article we proof\nthat random gaussian free fermions satisfy ETH in the multiparticle sector, by\nanalytically computing the correlations and entanglement entropies of the\ntheory. With the explicit construction at hand, we finally comment on the\ndifferences between fully random Hamiltonians and random Gaussian systems, and\non the connection between chaotic energy spectra and ETH.\n", "  Biological systems exploit self-assembly to create complex structures whose\narrangements are finely controlled from molecular to mesoscopic level. Herein\nwe report an example of using fully synthetic systems that mimic two levels of\nself-assembly. We show the formation of vesicles using amphiphilic copolymers\nwhose chemical nature is chosen to control both membrane formation and\nmembrane-confined interactions. We report polymersomes with patterns that\nemerge by engineering interfacial tension within the polymersome surface. This\nallows the formation of domains whose topology is tailored by the chemical\nsynthesis paving the avenue to complex supramolecular designs functionally\nsimilar to those found in viruses and trafficking vesicles.\n", "  We introduce a class of non-local Lagrangians which allow for the variational\nderivation of non-local conser- vation laws in a self-consistent manner. The\nformalism developed here generalizes previous approaches, used in the context\nof $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric quantum mechanics and optics in the paraxial\napproximation in a twofold way: firstly it is valid for a larger set of linear\nsymmetry transforms and secondly it enables the derivation of additional\nnon-local conservation laws for general higher dimensional wave mechanical\nsystems.\n", "  Jet multiplicity distributions in top quark pair (t t-bar) events are\nmeasured in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV with the CMS\ndetector at the LHC using a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity\nof 19.7 inverse femtobarns. The measurement is performed in the dilepton decay\nchannels (e+ e-, mu+ mu-, and e+/- mu-/+). The absolute and normalized\ndifferential cross sections for t t-bar production are measured as a function\nof the jet multiplicity in the event for different jet transverse momentum\nthresholds and the kinematic properties of the leading additional jets. The\ndifferential t t-bar b and t t-bar b b-bar cross sections are presented for the\nfirst time as a function of the kinematic properties of the leading additional\nb jets. Furthermore, the fraction of events without additional jets above a\nthreshold is measured as a function of the transverse momenta of the leading\nadditional jets and the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all additional\njets. The data are compared and found to be consistent with predictions from\nseveral perturbative quantum chromodynamics event generators and a\nnext-to-leading order calculation.\n", "  InAs/AlAs$_{x}$Sb$_{1-x}$ quantum wells are investigated for their potential\nas hot carrier solar cells. Continuous wave power and temperature dependent\nphotoluminescence indicate a transition in the dominant hot carrier relaxation\nprocess from conventional phonon-mediated carrier relaxation below 90 K to a\nregime where inhibited radiative recombination dominates the hot carrier\nrelaxation at elevated temperatures. At temperatures below 90 K\nphotoluminescence measurements are consistent with type-I quantum wells that\nexhibit hole localization associated with alloy/interface fluctuations. At\nelevated temperatures hole delocalization reveals the true type-II band\nalignment; where it is observed that inhibited radiative recombination due to\nthe spatial separation of the charge carriers dominates hot carrier relaxation.\nThis decoupling of phonon-mediated relaxation results in robust hot carriers at\nhigher temperatures even at lower excitation powers. These results indicate\ntype-II quantum wells offer potential as practical hot carrier systems.\n", "  Although superconducting systems provide a promising platform for quantum\ncomputing, their networking poses a challenge as they cannot be interfaced to\nlight---the medium used to send quantum signals through channels at room\ntemperature. We show that mechanical oscillators can mediated such coupling and\nlight can be used to measure the joint state of two distant qubits. The\nmeasurement provides information on the total spin of the two qubits such that\nentangled qubit states can be postselected. Entanglement generation is possible\nwithout ground-state cooling of the mechanical oscillators for systems with\noptomechanical cooperativity moderately larger than unity; in addition, our\nsetup tolerates a substantial transmission loss. The approach is scalable to\ngeneration of multipartite entanglement and represents a crucial step towards\nquantum networks with superconducting circuits.\n", "  We have presented a new anisotropic solution of Einstein's field equations\nfor compact star models. The Einstein's field equations are solved by using the\nclass one condition \\cite{1}. After that we constructed the physically valid\nexpression of anisotropy factor by the help of metric potentials and there\nafter we obtained the physical parameters like energy density, radial and\ntransverse pressure. These models parameters are well behaved inside the\ncompact star and satisfy all the required physical conditions. Also we observed\na very interesting result that all the physical parameters are depend on the\nanisotropy factor. The present compact star models are quite compatible with\nthe observational astrophysical compact stellar objects like Her X-1, RXJ\n1856-37, SAX J1808.4-3658(SS1), SAX J1808.4-3658(SS2)\n", "  Nanogenerators based on ZnO nanowires (NWs) realize the energy conversion at\nnanoscale, which are ascribed to the piezoelectric property caused by the\nlattice distortion of the ZnO NWs. The lattice distortion can significantly\ntune the electronic and optical properties, and requires a sensitive and\nconvenient measurement. However, high-resolution transmission electron\nmicroscopy (HRTEM) technique provides a limited sensitivity of 0.01 nm on the\nvariation of the lattice spacing and requires vacuum conditions. Here we\ndemonstrate a highly-sensitive detection of the lattice distortion in single\nbent ZnO NWs by second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. As the curvature\nof the single bent ZnO NW increases to 21 mm-1 (<4% bending distortion), it\nshows a significant decrease (~70%) in the SHG intensity ratio between\nperpendicular and parallel excitation polarization with respect to c-axis of\nZnO NWs. Importantly, the extraordinary non-axisymmetrical SHG polarimetric\npatterns are also observed, indicating the twisting distortion around c-axis of\nZnO NWs. Thus, SHG microscopy provides a sensitive all-optical and non-invasive\nmethod for in situ detecting the lattice distortion under various\ncircumstances.\n", "  The interaction of quantum emitters with one-dimensional photon-like\nreservoirs induces strong and long-range dissipative couplings that give rise\nto the emergence of so-called Decoherence Free Subspaces (DFS) which are\ndecoupled from dissipation. When introducing weak perturbations on the\nemitters, e.g., driving, the strong collective dissipation enforces an\neffective coherent evolution within the DFS. In this work, we show explicitly\nhow by introducing single-site resolved drivings, we can use the effective\ndynamics within the DFS to design a universal set of one and two-qubit gates\nwithin the DFS of two-level atom-like systems. Using Liouvillian perturbation\ntheory we calculate the scaling with the relevant figures of merit of the\nsystems, such as the Purcell Factor and imperfect control of the drivings.\nFinally, we compare our results with previous proposals using atomic $\\Lambda$\nsystems in leaky cavities.\n", "  Perturbative unitarity conditions have been playing an important role by\nestimating the energy scale of new physics, including the Higgs mass as one of\nthe most important examples. In this letter, we show that there is a\npossibility to see the hint of a new physics (top quark partner) indirectly by\nobserving an \"apparent\" unitarity violation in $M_{bw}$ distribution well above\ntop quark mass in a process of a heavy resonance decaying into a pair of top\nquarks.\n", "  Prior research has shown that spectral decomposition of the reduced power\nflow Jacobian (RPFJ) can yield participation factors that describe the extent\nto which particular buses contribute to particular spectral components of a\npower system. Research has also shown that both variance and autocorrelation of\ntime series voltage data tend to increase as a power system with stochastically\nfluctuating loads approaches certain critical transitions. This paper presents\nevidence suggesting that a system's participation factors predict the relative\nbus voltage variance values for all nodes in a system. As a result, these\nparticipation factors can be used to filter, weight, and combine real time PMU\ndata from various locations dispersed throughout a power network in order to\ndevelop coherent measures of global voltage stability. This paper first\ndescribes the method of computing the participation factors. Next, two\npotential uses of the participation factors are given: (1) predicting the\nrelative bus voltage variance magnitudes, and (2) locating generators at which\nthe autocorrelation of voltage measurements clearly indicate proximity to\ncritical transitions. The methods are tested using both analytical and\nnumerical results from a dynamic model of a 2383-bus test case.\n", "  Muon Telescope Detector (MTD) is a newly installed detector in the STAR\nexperiment. It provides an excellent opportunity to study heavy quarkonium\nphysics using the dimuon channel in heavy ion collisions. In this paper, we\nreport the muon identification performance for the MTD using proton-proton\ncollision at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 500 GeV with various methods. The result using the\nLikelihood Ratio method shows that the muon identification efficiency can reach\nto $\\sim$90% for muons with transverse momentum greater than 3 GeV/c and the\nsignificance of J/$\\psi$ signal is improved by $\\sim$40% compared to using the\nbasic selection.\n", "  Finite elements has been proven to be an useful tool to discretize the\nvertical coordinate in the hydrostatic forecast models allowing to define model\nvariables in full levels so that no staggering is needed. In the\nnon-hydrostatic case a constraint in the vertical operators appears (called C1)\nthat does not allow to reduce the set of semi-implicit linear equations to a\nsingle equation in one variable as in the analytic case. Recently vertical\nfinite elements based in B-splines have been used with an iterative method to\nrelax the C1 constraint. In this paper we want to develop properly some\nrepresentations of vertical operators in terms of B-splines in order to keep\nthe C1-constraint. An invertibility relation between integral and derivative\noperators between vertical velocity and vertical divergence is also presented.\nThe final scope of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework of\ndevelopment of finite element vertical operators to be implemented in the\nALADIN-HIRLAM nwp system\n", "  Here we demonstrate generating and storing entanglement in a solid state\nspin-wave quantum memory with on-demand read out using the process of rephased\namplified spontaneous emission (RASE). Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE),\nresulting from an inverted ensemble of Pr$^{3+}$ ions doped into a Y$_2$SiO$_5$\ncrystal, generates entanglement between collective states of the praseodymium\nensemble and the output light. The ensemble is then rephased using a four-level\nphoton echo technique. Entanglement between the ASE and its echo is confirmed\nand the inseparability violation preserved when the RASE is stored as a\nspin-wave for up to 5 $\\mu$s. RASE is shown to be temporally multimode with\nalmost perfect distinguishability between two temporal modes demonstrated.\nThese results pave the way for the use of multimode solid state quantum\nmemories in scalable quantum networks.\n", "  We present a relativistic formulation of the quantum Hall effect on Haldane\nsphere. An explicit form of the pseudopotential is derived for the relativistic\nquantum Hall effect with/without mass term. We clarify particular features of\nthe relativistic quantum Hall states with the use of the exact diagonalization\nstudy of the pseudopotential Hamiltonian. Physical effects of the mass term to\nthe relativistic quantum Hall states are investigated in detail. The mass term\nacts as an interpolating parameter between the relativistic and\nnon-relativistic quantum Hall effects. It is pointed out that the mass term\nunevenly affects the many-body physics of the positive and negative Landau\nlevels as a manifestation of the \"parity anomaly\". In particular, we explicitly\ndemonstrate the instability of the Laughlin state of the positive first\nrelativistic Landau level with the reduction of the charge gap.\n", "  One of the cornerstones in non--equilibrium statistical mechanics (NESM) is\nLiouville's theorem, a differential equation for the phase space probability\n$\\rho(q,p; t)$. This is usually derived considering the flow in or out of a\ngiven surface for a physical system (composed of atoms), via more or less\nheuristic arguments.\n  In this work, we derive the Liouville equation as the partial differential\nequation governing the dynamics of the time-dependent probability $\\rho(q, p;\nt)$ of finding a \"particle\" with Lagrangian $L(q, \\dot{q}; t)$ in a specific\npoint $(q, p)$ in phase space at time $t$, with $p=\\partial L/\\partial\n\\dot{q}$. This derivation depends only on considerations of inference over a\nspace of continuous paths. Because of its generality, our result is valid not\nonly for \"physical\" systems but for any model depending on constrained\ninformation about position and velocity, such as time series.\n", "  We propose a method to simulate spin models in trapped ions using a\ndigital-analog approach, consisting in a suitable gate decomposition in terms\nof analog blocks and digital steps. In this way, we show that the quantum\ndynamics of an enhanced variety of spin models could be implemented with\nsubstantially less number of gates than a fully digital approach. Typically,\nanalog blocks are built of multipartite dynamics providing the complexity of\nthe simulated model, while the digital steps are local operations bringing\nversatility to it. Finally, we describe a possible experimental implementation\nin trapped-ion technologies.\n", "  In this paper, we study the effect of conversion of super-light sterile\nneutrino (SLSN) to electron neutrino in matter like that of the Earth. In the\nSun the resonance conversion between SLSN and electron neutrino via the neutral\ncurrent is suppressed due to the smallness of neutron number. On the other\nhand, neutron number density can play an important role in the Earth, making\nthe scenario of SLSN quite interesting. The effect of CP-violating phases on\nactive-SLSN oscillations is also discussed. Reactor neutrino experiments with\nmedium or short baseline may probe the scenario of SLSN.\n", "  A search is presented for narrow heavy resonances X decaying into pairs of\nHiggs bosons (H) in proton-proton collisions collected by the CMS experiment at\nthe LHC at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of\n19.7 inverse femtobarns. The search considers HH resonances with masses between\n1 and 3 TeV, having final states of two b quark pairs. Each Higgs boson is\nproduced with large momentum, and the hadronization products of the pair of b\nquarks can usually be reconstructed as single large jets. The background from\nmultijet and t t-bar events is significantly reduced by applying requirements\nrelated to the flavor of the jet, its mass, and its substructure. The signal\nwould be identified as a peak on top of the dijet invariant mass spectrum of\nthe remaining background events. No evidence is observed for such a signal.\nUpper limits obtained at 95% confidence level for the product of the production\ncross section and branching fraction sigma(gg to X) B(X to HH to b b-bar b\nb-bar) range from 10 to 1.5 fb for the mass of X from 1.15 to 2.0 TeV,\nsignificantly extending previous searches. For a warped extra dimension theory\nwith a mass scale Lambda[R] = 1 TeV, the data exclude radion scalar masses\nbetween 1.15 and 1.55 TeV.\n", "  Complex networks tend to display communities which are groups of nodes\ncohesively connected among themselves in one group and sparsely connected to\nthe remainder of the network. Detecting such communities is an important\ncomputational problem, since it provides an insight into the functionality of\nnetworks. Further, investigating community structure in a dynamic network,\nwhere the network is subject to change, is even more challenging. This paper\npresents a game-theoretical technique for detecting community structures in\ndynamic as well as static complex networks. In our method, each node takes the\nrole of a player that attempts to gain a higher payoff by joining one or more\ncommunities or switching between them. The goal of the game is to reveal\ncommunity structure formed by these players by finding a Nash-equilibrium point\namong them. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first game-theoretic\nalgorithm which is able to extract overlapping communities from either static\nor dynamic networks. We present the experimental results illustrating the\neffectiveness of the proposed method on both synthetic and real-world networks.\n", "  The search for nontrivial superconductivity in novel quantum materials is\ncurrently a most attractive topic in condensed matter physics and material\nscience. The experimental studies have progressed quickly over the past couple\nof years. In this article, we report systematic studies of superconductivity in\nAu2Pb single crystals. The bulk superconductivity (onset transition\ntemperature, Tconset= 1.3 K) of Au2Pb is characterized by both transport and\ndiamagnetic measurements, where the upper critical field Hc2 shows unusual\nquasi-linear temperature dependence. The superconducting gap is revealed by\npoint contact measurement with gold tip. However, when using tungsten (W) tip,\nwhich is much harder, the superconducting gap probed is largely enhanced as\ndemonstrated by the increases of both Tconset and upper critical field (Hc2).\nThis can be interpreted as a result of increase in density of states under\nexternal anisotropic stress imposed by the tip, as revealed by first-principles\ncalculations. Furthermore, novel phase winding of the pseudospin texture along\nk-space loops around the Fermi energy is uncovered from the calculations,\nindicating that the observed superconductivity in Au2Pb may have nontrivial\ntopology.\n", "  We present a numerical study of the many-body localization (MBL) phenomenon\nin the high-temperature limit within an anisotropic Heisenberg model with\nrandom local fields. Taking the dynamical spin conductivity $\\sigma(\\omega)$ as\nthe test quantity, we investigate the full frequency dependence of\nsample-to-sample fluctuations and their scaling properties as a function of the\nsystem size $L\\leq 28$ and the frequency resolution. We identify differences\nbetween the general interacting case $\\Delta>0$ and the anisotropy $\\Delta=0$,\nthe latter corresponding to the standard Anderson localization. Except for the\nextreme MBL case when the relative sample-to-sample fluctuations became large,\nnumerical results allow for the extraction of the low-$\\omega$ dependence of\nthe conductivity. Results for the d.c. value $\\sigma_0$ indicate a crossover\ninto the MBL regime, i.e. an exponential-like variation with the disorder\nstrength $W$. For the same regime, our numerical analysis indicates that the\nlow-frequency exponent $\\alpha$ exhibits a small departure from $\\alpha\\sim 1$\nonly.\n", "  We introduce a new classical spin liquid on the pyrochlore lattice by\nextending spin ice with further neighbour interactions. We find that this\ndisorder free spin model exhibits a form of dynamical heterogeneity with\nextremely slow relaxation for some spins while others fluctuate quickly down to\nzero temperature. We thus call this state \"spin slush\", in analogy to the\nheterogeneous mixture of solid and liquid water. This behaviour is driven by\nthe structure of the ground state manifold which extends the celebrated the\ntwo-in/two-out ice states to include branching structures built from\nthree-in/one-out, three-out/one-in and all-in/all-out tetrahedra defects.\nDistinctive liquid-like patterns in the spin correlations serve as a signature\nof this intermediate range order. Possible applications to materials as well\nthe effects of quantum tunneling are discussed.\n", "  This article presents a detailed study of the photodissociation probability\nof D_{2}^{+} for a wide range of photon energy. One dimensional numerical\ncalculations have been performed to provide the best possible physical\nquantities that characterize the vibrational trapping or bond hardening effect\nduring the photodissociation dynamics. These results undoubtedly show that the\nnodes of the nuclear vibrational wave packets play a decisive role in the\nvibrational trapping, in addition to the current understating of this\nphenomenon.\n", "  Using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Expectation Maximization Algorithm, we\nperform an analysis of time duration ($T_{90}$) for \\textit{CGRO}/BATSE,\n\\textit{Swift}/BAT and \\textit{Fermi}/GBM Gamma-Ray Bursts. The $T_{90}$\ndistributions of 298 redshift-known \\textit{Swift}/BAT GRBs have also been\nstudied in both observer and rest frames. Bayesian Information Criterion has\nbeen used to compare between different GMM models. We find that two Gaussian\ncomponents are better to describe the \\textit{CGRO}/BATSE and\n\\textit{Fermi}/GBM GRBs in the observer frame. Also, we caution that two groups\nare expected for the \\textit{Swift}/BAT bursts in the rest frame, which is\nconsistent with some previous results. However, \\textit{Swift} GRBs in the\nobserver frame seem to show a trimodal distribution, of which the superficial\nintermediate class may result from the selection effect of \\textit{Swift}/BAT.\n", "  We explore the possibility of finding Pure Lovelock gravity as a particular\nlimit of a Chern-Simons action for a specific expansion of the AdS algebra in\nodd dimensions. We derive this relation at the level of the action in five and\nseven dimensions. Additionally we provide the general result for higher\ndimensions and discuss some issues arising from the obtained dynamics.\n", "  In this paper we study the relativistic quantum dynamics of a massless\nfermion confined in a quantum ring. We use a model of confining potential and\nintroduce the interaction via Dirac oscillator coupling, which provides ring\nconfinement for massless Dirac fermions. We obtain the energy levels and\ncorresponding eigenfuctions for this model in graphene layer in the presence of\nAharonov-Bohm flux in the centre of the ring and the expression for persistent\ncurrent in this model. We also investigate the model for quantum ring in\ngraphene layer in the presence of disclination and magnetic flux. The energy\nspectrum and wave function are obtained exactly for this case. We see that the\npersistent current depends in parameters characterizing the topological defect.\n", "  The charge transport mechanism of electron via traps in amorphous SiO$_2$ has\nbeen studied. Electron transport is limited by phonon-assisted tunneling\nbetween traps. Thermal and optical trap energies $W_\\mathrm{t}=1.6$ eV,\n$W_\\mathrm{opt}=3.2$ eV, respectively, were determined. Charge flowing leads to\noxygen vacancies generation, and the leakage current increases due to the\nincrease of charge trap density. Long-time annealing at high temperatures\ndecreased the leakage current to initial values due to oxygen vacancies\nrecombination with interstitial oxygen. It is found that the oxygen vacancies\nact as electron traps in SiO$_2$.\n", "  We report on the successful synthesis and on the properties of\npolycrystalline AgPbmSnSe2+m (m = ++++, 100, 50, 25) samples with a rock salt\nstructure. Between 160 K and 400 K, the dominant scattering process of the\ncarriers in this system changes from acoustic phonon scattering in PbSe to\nionized impurity scattering in AgPbmSnSe2+m, which synergistically optimizes\nelectrical and thermal transport properties. Thanks to the faint amount of\nAgSnSe2, the Seebeck coefficient is enhanced by boosting the scattering factor,\nthe electric conductivity is improved by the increase of the concentration of\nholes coupled to a limited degradation of their mobility, and the total thermal\nconductivity is reduced by suppressing bipolar thermal conductivity. Therefore,\nZT of AgPbmSnSe2+m (m = 50) reaches 1.3 at 889 K. The mechanism suggested in\nthis study opens new paths to improve the thermoelectric performances of other\nfamilies of materials.\n", "  We study low temperature properties of the Hubbard model for the bismuth\nnickelate, where degenerate orbitals in the nickel ions and a single orbital in\nthe bismuth ions are taken into account, combining dynamical mean-field theory\nwith the continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo method. We discuss the effect of\nthe attractive interactions to mimic the valence skipping phenomenon in the\nbismuth ions. We demonstrate how the charge and magnetically ordered states are\nstable against thermal fluctuations. It is furthermore clarified that the\nferromagnetically ordered and orbital ordered states are stabilized due to the\npresence of the orbital degeneracy at low temperatures. The crossover between\nmetallic and insulating states is also discussed.\n", "  We develop a perturbative treatment of induced dipole-dipole interactions in\nthe diffusive transport of electromagnetic waves through disordered atomic\nclouds. The approach is exact at order two in the atomic density and accounts\nfor the vector character of light. It is applied to the calculation of the\nelectromagnetic energy stored in the atomic cloud - which modifies the energy\ntransport velocity - and of the light scattering and transport mean free paths.\nResults are compared to those obtained from a purely scalar model for light.\n", "  The control and measurement of local non-equilibrium configurations is of\nutmost importance in applications on energy harvesting, thermoelectrics and\nheat management in nano-electronics. This challenging task can be achieved with\nthe help of various local probes, prominent examples including superconducting\nor quantum dot based tunnel junctions, classical and quantum resistors, and\nRaman thermography. Beyond time-averaged properties, valuable information can\nalso be gained from spontaneous fluctuations of current (noise). From these\nperspective, however, a fundamental constraint is set by current conservation,\nwhich makes noise a characteristic of the whole conductor, rather than some\npart of it. Here we demonstrate how to remove this obstacle and pick up a local\nnoise temperature of a current biased diffusive conductor with the help of a\nminiature noise probe. This approach is virtually noninvasive and extends\nprimary local measurements towards strongly non-equilibrium regimes.\n", "  We estimate the photon production rate from an SU(3) plasma at temperatures\nof about 1.1Tc and 1.3Tc. Lattice results for the vector current correlator at\nspatial momenta k ~ (2-6)T are extrapolated to the continuum limit and analyzed\nwith the help of a polynomial interpolation for the corresponding spectral\nfunction, which vanishes at zero frequency and matches to high-precision\nperturbative results at large invariant masses. For small invariant masses the\ninterpolation is compared with the NLO weak-coupling result, hydrodynamics, and\na holographic model. At vanishing invariant mass we extract the photon rate\nwhich for k \\gsim 3T is found to be close to the NLO weak-coupling prediction.\nFor k \\lsim 2T uncertainties remain large but the photon rate is likely to fall\nbelow the NLO prediction, in accordance with the onset of a strongly\ninteracting behaviour characteristic of the hydrodynamic regime.\n", "  We introduce the `Illustris zoom simulation project', which allows the study\nof selected galaxies forming in the $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology with a 40 times\nbetter mass resolution than in the parent large-scale hydrodynamical Illustris\nsimulation. We here focus on the starburst properties of the gas in four\ncosmological simulations of major mergers. The galaxies in our high-resolution\nzoom runs exhibit a bursty mode of star formation with gas consumption\ntimescales 10 times shorter than for the normal star formation mode. The strong\nbursts are only present in the simulations with the highest resolution, hinting\nthat a too low resolution is the reason why the original Illustris simulation\nshowed a dearth of starburst galaxies. Very pronounced bursts of star formation\noccur in two out of four major mergers we study. The high star formation rates,\nthe short gas consumption timescales and the morphology of these systems\nstrongly resemble observed nuclear starbursts. This is the first time that a\nsample of major mergers is studied through self-consistent cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations instead of using isolated galaxy models setup on a\ncollision course. We also study the orbits of the colliding galaxies and find\nthat the starbursting gas preferentially appears in head-on mergers with very\nhigh collision velocities. Encounters with large impact parameters do typically\nnot lead to the formation of starbursting gas.\n", "  We use classical lattice simulations in 3+1 dimensions to study the interplay\nbetween the resonant production of particles during preheating and the\nsubsequent decay of these into a set of secondary species. We choose to work in\na simplified version of Higgs inflation in which the Higgs field non-minimally\ncoupled to gravity plays the role of the inflaton. Our numerical results extend\nthe analytical estimates in the literature beyond the linear regime and shed\nsome light on the limitations of the analytical techniques. The inclusion of\nfast and inefficient decays postpones the onset of parametric resonance by\ndepleting the particles produced at the bottom of the potential. In spite of\nthis delay, fermions are shown to play an important role on the destruction of\nthe inflaton field. The limitations of our approach and its applications to a\nrealistic Higgs inflation scenario are also discussed.\n", "  We propose the lattice QCD calculation of the Berry phase which is defined by\nthe ground state of a single fermion. We perform the ground-state projection of\na single-fermion propagator, construct the Berry link variable on a\nmomentum-space lattice, and calculate the Berry phase. As the first\napplication, the first Chern number of the (2+1)-dimensional Wilson fermion is\ncalculated by the Monte Carlo simulation.\n", "  A new theoretical approach to spin-isospin excitations in open-shell nuclei\nis presented. The developed method is based on the relativistic meson-exchange\nnuclear Lagrangian of Quantum Hadrodynamics and extends the response theory for\nsuperfluid nuclear systems beyond relativistic quasiparticle random phase\napproximation in the proton-neutron channel (pn-RQRPA). The coupling between\nquasiparticle degrees of freedom and collective vibrations (phonons) introduces\na time-dependent effective interaction, in addition to the exchange of pion and\n$\\rho$-meson taken into account without retardation. The time-dependent\ncontributions are treated in the resonant time-blocking approximation, in\nanalogy to previously developed relativistic quasiparticle time blocking\napproximation (RQTBA) in the neutral (non-isospin-flip) channel. The new method\nis called proton-neutron RQTBA (pn-RQTBA) and applied to Gamow-Teller resonance\nin a chain of neutron-rich Nickel isotopes $^{68-78}$Ni. A strong fragmentation\nof the resonance along with quenching of the strength, as compared to pn-RQRPA,\nis obtained. Based on the calculated strength distribution, beta-decay\nhalf-lives of the considered isotopes are computed and compared to pn-RQRPA\nhalf-lives and to experimental data. It is shown that a considerable\nimprovement of the half-life description is obtained in pn-RQTBA because of the\nspreading effects, which bring the lifetimes to a very good quantitative\nagreement with data.\n", "  Statistical properties of photon count maps have recently been proven as a\nnew tool to study the composition of the gamma-ray sky with high precision. We\nemploy the 1-point probability distribution function of 6 years of Fermi-LAT\ndata to measure the source-count distribution dN/dS and the diffuse components\nof the high-latitude gamma-ray sky as a function of energy. To that aim, we\nanalyze the gamma-ray emission in five adjacent energy bands between 1 GeV and\n171 GeV. It is demonstrated that the source-count distribution as a function of\nflux is compatible with a broken power law up to energies of ~50 GeV. The index\nbelow the break is between 1.95 and 2.0. For higher energies, a simple\npower-law fits the data, with an index of 2.2^{+0.7}_{-0.3} in the energy band\nbetween 50 GeV and 171 GeV. Upper limits on further possible breaks as well as\nthe angular power of unresolved sources are derived. We find that point-source\npopulations probed by this method can explain 83^{+7}_{-13}% (81^{+52}_{-19}%)\nof the extragalactic gamma-ray background between 1.04 GeV and 1.99 GeV (50 GeV\nand 171 GeV). The method has excellent capabilities for constraining the\ngamma-ray luminosity function and the spectra of unresolved blazars.\n", "  The final results of the search for the lepton flavour violating decay\n$\\mu^{+} \\rightarrow {\\rm e^{+}} \\gamma$ based on the full dataset collected by\nthe MEG experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institut in the period 2009--2013 and\ntotalling $7.5\\times 10^{14}$ stopped muons on target are presented. No\nsignificant excess of events is observed in the dataset with respect to the\nexpected background and a new upper limit on the branching ratio of this decay\nof $BR( \\mu^{+} \\rightarrow {\\rm e^{+}} \\gamma ) < 4.2 \\times 10^{-13}$ (90\\%\\\nconfidence level) is established, which represents the most stringent limit on\nthe existence of this decay to date.\n", "  In the cosmological scenario in $f\\left( T\\right) $ gravity, we find\nanalytical solutions for an isotropic and homogeneous universe containing a\ndust fluid and radiation and for an empty anisotropic Bianchi I universe. The\nmethod that we apply is that of movable singularities of differential\nequations. For the isotropic universe, the solutions are expressed in terms of\na Laurent expansion, while for the anisotropic universe we find a family of\nexact Kasner-like solutions in vacuum. Finally, we discuss when a nonlinear\n$f\\left( T\\right) $-gravity theory provides solutions for the teleparallel\nequivalence of general relativity and derive conditions for exact solutions of\ngeneral relativity to solve the field equations of an $f(T)$ theory.\n", "  The outcomes of a series of measurements, made on a quantum system, form a\nsequence of random events which occur in a particular order. The system,\ntogether with a meter or meters, can be seen as following the paths of a\nstochastic network connecting all possible outcomes. The paths are shaped from\nthe virtual paths of the system, and the corresponding probabilities are\ndetermined by the measuring devices employed. If the measurements are highly\naccurate, the virtual paths become \"real\", and the mean values of a quantity (a\nfunctional) is directly related to the frequencies with which the paths are\ntravelled. If the measurements are highly inaccurate, the mean (weak) values\nare expressed in terms of the relative probabilities amplitudes. For pre- and\npost-selected systems they are bound to take arbitrary values, depending on the\nchosen transition. This is a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle,\nwhich forbids one to distinguish between interfering alternatives, while\nleaving the interference between them intact.\n", "  We report the detection of spin interference signal in an Aharonov-Bohm type\ninterferometer with quantum dots on the conduction paths. We have found that\nresonators like quantum dots can work as efficient spin rotators. The\ninterference signal appears only when spin-polarized electrons are injected\ninto the device. The interference pattern in the gate voltage-magnetic field\nplane is checker board like, ensuring the modulation of spin wavefunction's\nphase as well as the orbital phase.\n", "  Multimode interference couplers are a fundamental building block in many\nintegrated photonic systems, ranging from high-speed coherent receivers to\nquantum splitters. However, their basic structure has remained fundamentally\nunchanged for almost four decades, limiting their size and operation bandwidth.\nUsing sub-wavelength metamaterials, photonic devices with break-through size\nand performance have been recently reported. Leveraging the inherent anisotropy\nof these structures, here we derive a semi-analytic expression that enables the\ndesign of compact and ultra broadband multimode interference couplers. We\nexperimentally demonstrate virtually perfect operation over a bandwidth in\nexcess of 300nm (500nm in simulation), for a device three times shorter than\nits conventional counterpart, making this the most broadband multimode\ninterference coupler reported to date. These results will enable ultra\nbroadband integrated systems for applications in communications and sensing.\n", "  The response of a detector to gravitational wave is a function of frequency.\nWhen the time a photon moving around in the Fabry-Perot cavities is the same\norder of the period of a gravitational wave, the phase-difference due to the\ngravitational wave should be an integral along the path. We present a formula\ndescription for detector response to gravitational wave with varied\nfrequencies. The LIGO data for GW150914 and GW 151226 are reexamined in this\nframework. For GW150924, the traveling time of a photon in the LIGO detector is\njust a bit larger than a half period of the highest frequency of gravitational\nwave and the similar result is obtained with LIGO and Virgo collaborations.\nHowever, we are not always so luck. In the case of GW151226, the time of a\nphoton traveling in the detector is larger than the period of the highest\nfrequency of gravitational wave and the announced signal cannot match well the\ntemplate with the initial black hole masses 14.2M$_\\odot$ and 7.5M$_\\odot$.\n", "  We show how the Laplace transform can be used to give a solution of the\ntime-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation for an arbitrary initial wave packet if\nthe solution of the stationary equation is known. The solution is obtained\nwithout summing up eigenstates nor do we need the path integral. We solve the\ninitial value problem for three characteristic piecewise constant potentials.\nThe results give an intuitive picture of the wave packet dynamics, reproducing\nexplicitly all possible reflection and transmission processes. We investigate\nclassical and quantum properties of the evolution and determine the reflection\nand transmission probabilities.\n", "  We use a fixed-order expansion of resummed soft-gluon corrections to\ndetermine an approximate NNLO formula for the partonic cross section of\nsingle-top production in the $s$-channel. This formula is implemented in the\nprogram Hathor for the numerical evaluation of hadronic cross sections. With\nthe resulting code, we perform a fit of the top-quark mass to Tevatron cross\nsection data. Results for $m_t$ are given in the pole-mass scheme and in the\n$\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme.\n", "  Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) has shown great potential and\npromising applications in advanced imaging fields for its capabilities of\nmaterial decomposition. However, image reconstructions and decompositions under\nsparse views dataset suffers severely from multi factors, such as\ninsufficiencies of data, appearances of noise, and inconsistencies of\nobservations. Under sparse views, conventional filtered back-projection type\nreconstruction methods fails to provide CT images with satisfying quality.\nMoreover, direct image decomposition is unstable and meet with noise boost even\nwith full views dataset. This paper proposes an iterative image reconstruction\nalgorithm and a practical image domain decomposition method for DECT. On one\nhand, the reconstruction algorithm is formulated as an optimization problem,\nwhich containing total variation regularization term and data fidelity term.\nThe alternating direction method is utilized to design the corresponding\nalgorithm which shows faster convergence speed compared with the existing ones.\nOn the other hand, the image domain decomposition applies the penalized least\nsquare (PLS) estimation on decomposing the material mappings. The PLS includes\nlinear combination term and the regularization term which enforces the\nsmoothness on estimation images. The authors implement and evaluate the\nproposed joint method on real DECT projections and compare the method with\ntypical and state-of-the-art reconstruction and decomposition methods. The\nexperiments on dataset of an anthropomorphic head phantom show that our methods\nhave advantages on noise suppression and edge reservation, without blurring the\nfine structures in the sinus area in the phantom. Compared to the existing\napproaches, our method achieves a superior performance on DECT imaging with\nrespect to reconstruction accuracy and decomposition quality.\n", "  Under the scenario of generalized measurements, it can be questioned how much\nof quantum uncertainty can be attributed to measuring device, independent of\nthe uncertainty in the measured system. On the course to answer the question,\nwe suggest a new class of entropic uncertainty relation that differentiates\nquantum uncertainty from device imperfection due to the unsharpness of\nmeasurement. In order to quantify the unsharpness, we {suggest} and analyze the\nquantity that characterizes the uncertainty in the measuring device, based on\nShannon entropy. Using the quantity, we obtain a new lower bound of entropic\nuncertainty with unsharpness and it has been shown that the relation can also\nbe obtained under the scenario that sharp observables are affected by the white\nnoise and amplitude damping.\n", "  We investigate the effect of strong magnetic fields on the adiabatic radial\noscillations of hadronic stars. We describe magnetized hadronic matter within\nthe framework of the relativistic nonlinear Walecka model and integrate the\nequations of relativistic radial oscillations to determine the fundamental\npulsation mode. We consider that the magnetic field increases, in a density\ndependent way, from the surface, where it has a typical magnetar value of\n$10^{15}$ G, to the interior of the star where it can be as large as $3 \\times\n10^{18}$ G. We show that magnetic fields of the order of $10^{18}$ G at the\nstellar core produce a significant change in the frequency of neutron star\npulsations with respect to unmagnetized objects. If radial pulsations are\nexcited in magnetar flares, they can leave an imprint in the flare lightcurves\nand open a new window for the study of highly magnetized ultradense matter.\n", "  We cross-correlate the largest available Mid-Infrared (WISE), X-ray (3XMM)\nand Radio (FIRST+NVSS) catalogues to define the MIXR sample of AGN and\nstar-forming galaxies. We pre-classify the sources based on their positions on\nthe WISE colour/colour plot, showing that the MIXR triple selection is\nextremely effective to diagnose the star formation and AGN activity of\nindividual populations, even on a flux/magnitude basis, extending the\ndiagnostics to objects with luminosities and redshifts from SDSS DR12. We\nrecover the radio/mid-IR star formation correlation with great accuracy, and\nuse it to classify our sources, based on their activity, as radio-loud and\nradio-quiet AGN, LERGs/LINERs, and non-AGN galaxies. These diagnostics can\nprove extremely useful for large AGN and galaxy samples, and help develop ways\nto efficiently triage sources when data from the next generation of instruments\nbecomes available. We study bias in detail, and show that while the widely-used\nWISE colour selections for AGN are very successful at cleanly selecting samples\nof luminous AGN, they miss or misclassify a substantial fraction of AGN at\nlower luminosities and/or higher redshifts. MIXR also allows us to test the\nrelation between radiative and kinetic (jet) power in radio-loud AGN, for which\na tight correlation is expected due to a mutual dependence on accretion. Our\nresults highlight that long-term AGN variability, jet regulation, and other\nfactors affecting the $Q/L$$_{bol}$ relation, are introducing a vast amount of\nscatter in this relation, with dramatic potential consequences on our current\nunderstanding of AGN feedback and its effect on star formation.\n", "  Using hybrid density functional theory, we address point defects susceptible\nto cause charge compensation upon Mg doping of GaN. We determine the free\nenergy of formation of the nitrogen vacancy and of several Mg-related defects.\nThe entropic contribution as a function of temperature is determined within the\nquasiharmonic approximation. We find that the Mg interstitial shows a\nnoticeably lower free energy of formation than the Mg substitutional to Ga in\np-type conditions. Therefore, the Mg impurity is amphoteric behaving like an\nacceptor when substitutional to Ga and like a double donor when accommodated in\nan interstitial position. The hybrid-functional results are then linked to\nexperimental observations by solving the charge neutrality equations for\nsemiconductor dominated by impurities. We show that a thermodynamic equilibrium\nmodel is unable to account for the experimental hole concentration as a\nfunction of Mg doping density, due to nitrogen vacancies and Mg interstitials\nacting as compensating donors. To explain the experimental result, which\nincludes a dropoff of the hole concentration at high Mg densities, we thus\nresort to nonequilibrium models. We show that either nitrogen vacancies or Mg\ninterstitials could be at the origin of the self-compensation mechanism.\nHowever, only the model based on interstitial Mg donors provides a natural\nmechanism to account for the sudden appearance of self-compensation. Indeed,\nthe amphoteric nature of the Mg impurity leads to Fermi-level pinning and\naccounts for the observed dropoff of the hole concentration of GaN samples at\nhigh Mg doping. Our work suggests that current limitations in p-type doping of\nGaN could be overcome by extrinsically controlling the Fermi energy during\ngrowth.\n", "  We investigate the structural properties of liquid water at near ambient\nconditions using first-principles molecular dynamics simulations based on a\nsemilocal density functional augmented with nonlocal van der Waals\ninteractions. The adopted scheme offers the advantage of simulating liquid\nwater at essentially the same computational cost of standard semilocal\nfunctionals. Applied to the water dimer and to ice Ih, we find that the\nhydrogen-bond energy is only slightly enhanced compared to a standard semilocal\nfunctional. We simulate liquid water through molecular dynamics in the NpH\nstatistical ensemble allowing for fluctuations of the system density. The\nstructure of the liquid departs from that found with a semilocal functional\nleading to more compact structural arrangements. This indicates that the\ndirectionality of the hydrogen-bond interaction has a diminished role as\ncompared to the overall attractions, as expected when dispersion interactions\nare accounted for. This is substantiated through a detailed analysis comprising\nthe study of the partial radial distribution functions, various local order\nindices, the hydrogen-bond network, and the selfdiffusion coefficient. The\nexplicit treatment of the van der Waals interactions leads to an overall\nimproved description of liquid water.\n", "  Stimulated by a very recent experiment observing successfully two\nsuperconducting states with even- and odd-number of electrons in a nanowire\ntopological superconductor as expected from the existence of two end Majorana\nquasiparticles (MQs) [Albrecht \\textit{et al.}, Nature \\textbf{531}, 206\n(2016)], we propose a way to manipulate Majorana qubit exploiting quantum\ntunneling effects. The prototype setup consists of two one-dimensional (1D)\ntopological superconductors coupled by a tunneling junction which can be\ncontrolled by gate voltage. We show that, upon current injection, the time\nevolution of superconducting phase difference at the junction induces an\noscillation in energy levels of the Majorana parity states, whereas the\nlevel-crossing is avoided by a small coupling energy of MQs in the individual\n1D superconductors. This results in a Landau-Zener-St\\\"{u}ckelberg (LZS)\ninterference between the Majorana parity states. Adjusting the current pulse\nand gate voltage, one can build a LZS interferometry which provides an\narbitrary manipulation of the Majorana qubit. The LZS rotation of Majorana\nqubit can be monitored by the microwave radiated from the junction.\n", "  We consider a scenario in which the global geometry of the universe is driven\nby non-linear fermions obeying Heisenberg dynamics.\n", "  Maximally Natural Supersymmetry, an unusual weak-scale supersymmetric\nextension of the Standard Model based upon the inherently higher-dimensional\nmechanism of Scherk-Schwarz supersymmetry breaking (SSSB), possesses remarkably\ngood fine tuning given present LHC limits. Here we construct a version with\nprecision $SU(2)_{\\rm L} \\times U(1)_{\\rm Y} $ unification: $\\sin^2\n\\theta_W(M_Z) \\simeq 0.231$ is predicted to $\\pm 2\\%$ by unifying $SU(2)_{\\rm\nL} \\times U(1)_{\\rm Y} $ into a 5D $SU(3)_{\\rm EW}$ theory at a Kaluza-Klein\nscale of $1/R_5 \\sim 4.4\\,{\\rm TeV}$, where SSSB is simultaneously realised.\nFull unification with $SU(3)_{\\rm C}$ is accommodated by extending the 5D\ntheory to a $N=4$ supersymmetric $SU(6)$ gauge theory on a 6D rectangular\norbifold at $1/R_6 \\sim 40 \\,{\\rm TeV}$. TeV-scale states beyond the SM include\nexotic charged fermions implied by $SU(3)_{\\rm EW}$ with masses lighter than\n$\\sim 1.2\\,{\\rm TeV}$, and squarks in the mass range $1.4\\,{\\rm TeV} -\n2.3\\,{\\rm TeV}$, providing distinct signatures and discovery opportunities for\nLHC run II.\n", "  All liquids in nature can be supercooled to form a glass. Surprisingly,\nalthough this phenomenon has been employed for millennia, it still remains\nill-understood. Perhaps the most puzzling feature of supercooled liquids is the\ndramatic increase in their viscosity as the temperature ($T$) is lowered. This\nprecipitous rise has long posed a fundamental theoretical challenge. Numerous\napproaches currently attempt to explain this phenomenon. When present, data\ncollapse points to an underlying simplicity in various branches of science. In\nthis Letter, we report on a 16 decade data collapse of the viscosity of 45\ndifferent liquids of all known types. Specifically, the viscosity of\nsupercooled liquids scaled by their value at their respective equilibrium\nmelting temperature ($\\eta(T)/\\eta(T_{melt}))$ is, for all temperatures\n$T<T_{melt}$, a universal function of $(T_{melt} - T)/(B T)$ where $B$ is a\nconstant that does not change significantly from one liquid to another. This\nexceptionally plain behavior hints at a link between glassy dynamics and the\nconventional equilibrium melting transition in all known supercooled fluids.\n", "  A new experimental approach for in-situ Raman spectroscopy of the electrode |\nsolid electrolyte interfaces in controlled atmospheres, based on the use of\noptically transparent single-crystal membranes of stabilized cubic zirconia,\nhas been proposed and validated. This technique makes it possible to directly\naccess the electrochemical reaction zone in SOFCs by passing the laser beam\nthrough single-crystal electrolyte onto the interface, in combination with\nsimultaneous electrochemical measurements. The case study centered on the\nanalysis of NiO reduction in standard cermet anodes under open-circuit\nconditions, demonstrated an excellent agreement between the observed kinetic\nparameters and literature data on nickel oxide. The porous cermet reduction\nkinetics at 400-600C in flowing H2-N2 gas mixture can be described by the\nclassical Avrami model, suggesting that the reaction rate is determined by the\nmetal nuclei growth limited by Ni diffusion. The advantages and limitations of\nthe new experimental approach were briefly discussed.\n", "  Following our earlier work, we construct statistical discrete geometry by\napplying statistical mechanics to discrete (Regge) gravity. We propose a\ncoarse-graining method for discrete geometry under the assumptions of atomism\nand background independence. To maintain these assumptions, restrictions are\ngiven to the theory by introducing cut-offs, both in ultraviolet and infrared\nregime. Having a well-defined statistical picture of discrete Regge geometry,\nwe take the infinite degrees of freedom (large n) limit. We argue that the\ncorrect limit consistent with the restrictions and the background independence\nconcept is not the continuum limit of statistical mechanics, but the\nthermodynamical limit.\n", "  A fragment of the folklore text \"Apai\" that was once put down on Easter\nIsland contains a report about astronomical observations of Kirch's Comet or\nthe Great Comet of 1680-1681 A.D. (C/1680 V1) and the partial solar eclipse of\nMarch 19, 1681 A.D. Some astronomical aspects of the local cult of bird-men\nhave been discussed, too.\n", "  The mechanical behavior in compression of [111] LiF micropillars with\ndiameters in the range 0.5 $\\mu$m to 2.0 $\\mu$m was analyzed by means of\ndiscrete dislocation dynamics at ambient and elevated temperature. The\ndislocation velocity was obtained from the Peach-Koehler force acting on the\ndislocation segments from a thermally-activated model that accounted for the\ninfluence of temperature on the lattice resistance. A size effect of the type\n\"smaller is stronger\" was predicted by the simulations, which was in\nquantitative agreement with previous experimental results by the authors\n\\cite{SWC14}. The contribution of the different physical deformation mechanisms\nto the size effect (namely, nucleation of dislocations, dislocation exhaustion\nand forest hardening) could be ascertained from the simulations and the\ndominant deformation mode could be assessed as a function of the specimen size\nand temperature. These results shed light into the complex interaction among\nsize, lattice resistance and dislocation mobility in the mechanical behavior of\n$\\mu$m-sized single crystals.\n", "  We show that Einstein's $R^{\\hat{0} \\hat{0}}$ equation for nonrelativistic\nmatter and strong gravitational fields is identical with Newton's equation for\nrelative radial acceleration of neighbouring freefalling particles, spherically\naveraged. These laws are explicitely identical with primary observer's (1)\nspace-time slicing by radial 4-geodesics, (2) radially parallel Local\nOrtho-Normal Bases, LONBs, (3) Riemann normal 3-coordinates. Hats on indices\ndenote LONBs. General relativity follows from Newton's law of relative\nacceleration, Einstein's inertial motion, Lorentz covariance, and\nenergy-momentum conservation combined with Bianchi identity. The gravitational\nfield equation of Newton-Gauss and Einstein's $R^{\\hat{0} \\hat{0}}$ equation\nare identical and linear in gravitational field for an inertial primary\nobserver.---\n  Einstein's equivalence between fictitious forces and gravitational forces is\nformulated as equivalence theorem in the equations of motion. With this, the\ngravitational field equation of 19th-century Newtonian physics and Einstein's\nequation for $R^{\\hat{0} \\hat{0}}$ are identical and bilinear in the\ngravitational forces for non-inertial primary observers.---\n  $R^{\\hat{0} \\hat{0}} = - div \\vec{E}_g$ and $2 R^{\\hat{i} \\hat{0}} = - (curl\n\\vec{B}_g)^{\\hat{i}}$ hold exactly for inertial primary observers, if one uses\nour LONB's. The gravitational $\\vec{E}_g, \\vec{B}_g $ are measured exactly with\nquasistatic particles via $(d/dt) p_{\\hat{i}}$ and $(d/dt) S_{\\hat{i}}$ in\ncorrespondence with the electromagnetic $\\vec{E}$ and $\\vec{B}$. The\n$(\\vec{E}_g, \\vec{B}_g)$ are identical with the observer's Ricci connection\nalong his worldline, $(\\omega_{\\hat{a} \\hat{b}})_{\\hat{0}}$.\n", "  In this note we establish the convergence of the stochastic six-vertex model\nto the one-dimensional asymmetric simple exclusion process, under a certain\nlimit regime recently predicted by Borodin-Corwin-Gorin. This convergence holds\nfor arbitrary initial data.\n", "  In this paper we consider two models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)\nuniversality class, the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) and the\nstochastic six-vertex model. We introduce a new class of initial data (which we\ncall {\\itshape generalized step Bernoulli initial data}) for both of these\nmodels that generalizes the step Bernoulli initial data studied in a number of\nrecent works on the ASEP. Under this class of initial data, we analyze the\ncurrent fluctuations of both the ASEP and stochastic six-vertex model and\nestablish the existence of a phase transition along a characteristic line,\nacross which the fluctuation exponent changes from $1 / 2$ to $1 / 3$. On the\ncharacteristic line, the current fluctuations converge to the general (rank\n$k$) Baik-Ben-Arous-P\\'{e}ch\\'{e} distribution for the law of the largest\neigenvalue of a critically spiked covariance matrix. For $k = 1$, this was\nestablished for the ASEP by Tracy and Widom; for $k > 1$ (and also $k = 1$, for\nthe stochastic six-vertex model), the appearance of these distributions in both\nmodels is new.\n", "  The area of research to discover new Li containing materials and to\nunderstand their physical properties has been of constant interest due to\napplications potential for rechargeable batteries. Here, we present the results\nof magnetic investigations on a Li compound, Li3Ni2RuO6, which was believed to\nbe a ferrimagnet below 80K. While our neutron diffraction (ND) and isothermal\nmagnetization (M) data support ferrimagnetism, more detailed magnetic studies\nestablish that this ferrimagnetic phase exhibits some features similar to\nspin-glasses. In addition, we find another broad magnetic anomaly around 40-55\nK in magnetic susceptibility, attributable to cluster spin-glass phenomenon.\nGradual dominance of cluster spin-glass dynamics with a decrease of temperature\n(T) and the apparent spread in freezing temperature suggest that the\nferrimagnetism of this compound is a chaotic one. The absence of a unique\nfreezing temperature for a crystalline material is interesting. In addition,\npyroelectric current data reveals a feature in the range 40-50 K, attributable\nto thermally stimulated depolarization current. We hope this finding motivates\nfuture work to explore whether there is any intriguing correlation of such a\nfeature with spin-glass dynamics. We attribute these magnetic and electric\ndipole anomalies to the crystallographic disorder intrinsic to this compound.\n", "  We have used inelastic neutron scattering to measure the magnetic excitation\nspectrum along the high-symmetry directions of the first Brillouin zone of the\nmagnetic skyrmion hosting compound Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. The majority of our\nscattering data are consistent with the expectations of a recently proposed\nmodel for the magnetic excitations in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$, and we report best-fit\nparameters for the dominant exchange interactions. Important differences exist,\nhowever, between our experimental findings and the model expectations. These\ninclude the identification of two energy scales that likely arise due to\nneglected anisotropic interactions. This feature of our work suggests that\nanisotropy should be considered in future theoretical work aimed at the full\nmicroscopic understanding of the emergence of the skyrmion state in this\nmaterial.\n", "  Two-dimensional colloidal nanosheets represent very attractive optoelectronic\nmaterials. They combine good lateral conductivity with solution-processability\nand geometry-tunable electronic properties. In case of PbS nanosheets, so far\nthe synthesis was driven by the addition of chloroalkanes as coligands. Here,\nwe demonstrate how to synthesize two-dimensional lead sulfide nanostructures\nusing other halogen alkanes and primary amines. Further, we show that at a\nreaction temperature of 170C a coligand is not even necessary, and the only\nligand, oleic acid, controls the anisotropic growth of the two-dimensional\nstructures and using thiourea as sulfide source, nanosheets with lateral\ndimensions of over 10 microns are possible.\n", "  By analyzing the optical tomogram of a linear superposition of coherent\nstates, we show that distinctive signatures of the macroscopic superposition\nstates are displayed directly in the optical tomograms of the states. We also\nstudy the effect of decoherence on the optical tomograms of the macroscopic\nsuperposition states. Since the wave packet fractional revivals are associated\nwith the generation of macroscopic superposition states, these signatures help\nin visualizing the revivals and fractional revivals occurring in a nonlinear\nmedium directly in the optical tomogram of the time-evolved state. We found\nthat the optical tomogram of the time-evolved state at the instants of\nfractional revivals show structures with sinusoidal strands. Using a class of\ninitial superposed wave packets evolving in the Kerr-like medium, we further\nshow that the condition for the occurrence of fractional revival phenomenon\ndepends on the number of wave packets composing the initial superposition\nstate. In the case of a two-mode electromagnetic field, we investigate the\nentanglement of the state directly using the optical tomogram. We have shown\nthat the signatures of entanglement can be observed directly in the single-mode\noptical tomogram of the state without reconstructing the density matrix of the\nsystem. We also analyze the effect of decoherence on the optical tomograms of\nthe entangled states. Further, we examine the optical tomograms of the\nentangled states generated using a beam splitter with a Kerr medium placed into\none of its input modes. We have found the signatures of entanglement in the\noptical tomogram for the entangled states generated at the instants of two- and\nthree-subpacket fractional revival times.\n", "  Particles weakly interacting with ordinary matter, with an associated mass of\nthe order of an atomic nucleus (WIMPs), are plausible candidates for Dark\nMatter. The direct detection of an elastic collision of a target nuclei induced\nby one of these WIMPs has to be discriminated from the signal produced by the\nneutrons, which leaves the same signal in a detector. The MIMAC (MIcro-tpc\nMAtrix of Chambers) collaboration has developed an original prototype detector\nwhich combines a large pixelated Micromegas coupled with a fast,\nself-triggering, electronics. Aspects of the two-chamber module in operation in\nthe Modane Underground Laboratory are presented: calibration, characterization\nof the $^{222}$Rn progeny. A new test bench combining a MIMAC chamber with the\nCOMIMAC portable quenching line has been set up to characterize the 3D tracks\nof low energy ions in the MIMAC gas mixture: the preliminary results thereof\nare presented. Future steps are briefly discussed.\n", "  The paper presents data on the production of the $^3$He nuclide in rocks\nunder the effect of cosmic-ray particles. The origin of the nuclide in the\nground in neutron- and proton-induced spallation reactions, reactions induced\nby high-energy muons, and negative muon capture reactions is analyzed. The\ncross sections of reactions producing $^3$He and $^3$H are calculated by means\nof numerical simulations with the GEANT4 simulation toolkit. The production\nrate of the $^3$He nuclide in the ground is evaluated for the average level of\nsolar activity at high geomagnetic latitudes and at sea level. It is proved\nthat the production of $^3$He in near-surface ground layers by spallation\nreactions induced by cosmic-ray protons may be approximately 10% of the total\nproduction rate of cosmogenic $^3$He. At depths of 10-50 m.w.e., the\naccumulation of $^3$He is significantly contributed by reactions induced by\ncosmic-ray muons. Data presented in the paper make it possible to calculate the\naccumulation rate of $^3$He in a rock depending on depth that is necessary for\nthe evaluation of the exposure time of the magmatic or metamorphic complex on\nthe Earth's surface ($^3$He dating).\n", "  Graphene has been predicted to develop a magnetic moment by proximity effect\nwhen placed on a ferromagnetic film, a promise that could open exciting\npossibilities in the fields of spintronics and magnetic data recording. In this\nwork, we study in detail the interplay between the magnetoresistance of\ngraphene and the magnetization of an underlying ferromagnetic insulating film.\nA clear correlation between both magnitudes is observed but we find, through a\ncareful modelling of the magnetization and the weak localization measurements,\nthat such correspondence can be explained by the effects of the magnetic stray\nfields arising from the ferromagnetic insulator. Our results emphasize the\ncomplexity arising at the interface between magnetic and two-dimensional\nmaterials.\n", "  We study the Josephson effect in spin-singlet superconductor/helical $p$-wave\nsuperconductor junctions with a ferromagnetic barrier using the quasiclassical\nGreen function method. It is found that both $\\sin{\\phi}$-type and\n$\\cos{\\phi}$-type current-phase relations always exist, irrespective of the gap\nsymmetries in superconductors. The indispensable condition for the\n$\\sin{\\phi}$-type and $\\cos{\\phi}$-type current is that the magnetization must\nhave a component parallel to the crystallographic $a$ or $b$ axis, which is\ndistinct from the case of $p$-wave superconductor described by a\n$\\vect{d}$-vector with a uniform direction. The relation between the condition\nand the symmetries of the gap functions is analysed. We investigate in detail\nthe symmetries and the sign reversal of the Josephson current when the\nmagnetization is rotated.\n", "  For coherent and direct-detection Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexed\n(OFDM) systems employing radio frequency (RF) pilot tone phase noise\ncancellation the influence of laser phase noise is evaluated. Novel analytical\nresults for the common phase error and for the (modulation dependent) inter\ncarrier interference are evaluated based upon Gaussian statistics for the laser\nphase noise. In the evaluation it is accounted for that the laser phase noise\nis filtered in the correlation signal detection. Numerical results are\npresented for OFDM systems with 4 and 16 PSK modulation, 200 OFDM bins and baud\nrate of 1 GS/s. It is found that about 225 km transmission is feasible for the\ncoherent 4PSK-OFDM system over normal (G.652) fiber.\n", "  A nonlinear transformation for the cylindrical KP(CKP) equation has been\nderived by using the simplified homogeneous balance method (SHB). The 1-decay\nmode and 2-decay mode solutions of the CKP equation have been obtained in terms\nof the nonlinear transformation derived here. The results obtained in the paper\nare different from those obtained in the previous literaturs.\n", "  We propose a scheme to detect light scalar moduli dark matter, based on\nmeasuring the change of magnetization induced in a macroscopic hard\nferromagnet. Our method can probe moduli dark matter at the natural coupling to\nthe electron mass over several orders of magnitude in the moduli mass. The most\nattracting feature of the proposed approach, compared to mechanical ones, is\nthat it relies on a nonresonant detection, allowing to probe a much wider\nregion of the parameter space. This is a crucial point, as long as the theory\nis not able to predict the moduli mass.\n", "  We report that two rotated layers of blue phosphorene behave as a direct band\ngap semiconductor. The optical spectrum shows absorption peaks in the visible\nregion of the spectrum and in addition the energy of these peaks can be tuned\nwith the rotational angle. These findings makes twisted bilayer blue\nphosphorene a strong candidate as a solar cell or photodetection device. Our\nresults are based on ab initio calculations of several rotated blue phosphorene\nlayers.\n", "  Typical galaxies emit about one third of their energy in the infrared. The\norigin of this emission reprocessed starlight absorbed by interstellar dust\ngrains and reradiated as thermal emission in the infrared. In particularly\ndusty galaxies, such as starburst galaxies, the fraction of energy emitted in\nthe infrared can be as high as 90%. Dust emission is found to be an excellent\ntracer of the beginning and end stages of a star's life, where dust is being\nproduced by post-main-sequence stars, subsequently added to the interstellar\ndust reservoir, and eventually being consumed by star and planet formation.\nThis work reviews the current understanding of the size and properties of this\ninterstellar dust reservoir, by using the Large Magellanic Cloud as an example,\nand what can be learned about the dust properties and star formation in\ngalaxies from this dust reservoir, using SPICA, building on previous work\nperformed with the Herschel and Spitzer Space Telescopes, as well as the\nInfrared Space Observatory.\n", "  We generalize the Rigid-Field Hydrodynamic equations to accommodate arbitrary\nmagnetic field topologies, resulting in a new Arbitrary Rigid-Field\nhydrodynamic (ARFHD) formalism. We undertake a critical point calculation of\nthe steady-state ARFHD equations with a CAK-type radiative acceleration and\ndetermine the effects of a dipole magnetic field on the usual CAK mass-loss\nrate and velocity structure. Enforcing the proper optically-thin limit for the\nradiative line-acceleration is found to decrease both the mass-loss and wind\nacceleration, while rotation boosts both properties. We define\noptically-thin-correction and rotation parameters to quantify these effects on\nthe global mass-loss rate and develop scaling laws for the surface mass-flux as\na function of surface colatitude. These scaling laws are found to agree with\nprevious laws derived from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetospheres.\nThe dipole magnetosphere velocity structure is found to differ from a global\nbeta-velocity law, which contradicts a central assumption of the\npreviously-developed XADM model of X-ray emission from magnetospheres.\n", "  During the last twenty years, a number of publications of\ntheoretical-numerical nature have appeared which come to the\napparently-reassuring conclusion that seismic motion on the ground in cities is\nsmaller than what this motion would be in the absence of the buildings (but for\nthe same underground and seismic load). Other than the fact that this finding\ntells nothing about the motion within the buildings, it must be confronted with\nthe overwhelming empirical evidence (e.g, earthquakes in Sendai (2011),\nKathmandu (2015), Tainan City (2016), etc.) that shaking within buildings of a\ncity is often large enough to damage or even destroy these structures. I show,\non several examples, that theory can be reconciled with empirical evidence, and\nsuggest that the crucial subject of seismic response in cities is in need of\nmore thorough research.\n", "  The optical vortices carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) are commonly\ngenerated by modulating the available conventional light beam. This article\nshows that a micro-laser operates at the exceptional point (EP) of the\nnon-Hermitian quantum system can directly emit vortex laser with well-defined\nOAM at will. Two gratings (the refractive index modulation and along azimuthal\ndirection and the grating protruding from the micro-ring cavity) modulate the\neigenmode of a micro-ring cavity to be a vortex laser mode. The phase-matching\ncondition ensures that we can tune the OAM of the vortex beam to be arbitrary\norders by changing the grating protruding from the micro-ring cavity while the\nsystem is kept at EP. The results are obtained by analytical analysis and\nconfirmed by 3D full wave simulations.\n", "  We use the CRPropa code to simulate the propagation of ultra high energy\ncosmic rays (with energy $\\geq 10^{18} \\rm eV$ and pure proton composition)\nthrough extragalactic magnetic fields that have been simulated with the\ncosmological ENZO code.We test both primordial and astrophysical magnetogenesis\nscenarios in order to investigate the impact of different magnetic field\nstrengths in clusters, filaments and voids on the deflection of cosmic rays\npropagating across cosmological distances. We also study the effect of\ndifferent source distributions of cosmic rays around simulated Milky-Way like\nobservers. Our analysis shows that the arrival spectra and anisotropy of events\nare rather insensitive to the distribution of extragalactic magnetic fields,\nwhile they are more affected by the clustering of sources within a $\\sim 50$\nMpc distance to observers. Finally, we find that in order to reproduce the\nobserved degree of isotropy of cosmic rays at $\\sim $ EeV energies, the average\nmagnetic fields in cosmic voids must be $\\sim 0.1 \\rm \\ nG$, providing limits\non the strength of primordial seed fields.\n", "  We report on an exploratory project aimed at performing immersive 3D\nvisualization of astronomical data, starting with spectral-line radio data\ncubes from galaxies. This work is done as a collaboration between the\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy and the Department of Computer Science at\nthe University of Manitoba. We are building our prototype using the 3D engine\nUnity, because of its ease of use for integration with advanced displays such\nas a CAVE environment, a zSpace tabletop, or virtual reality headsets. We\naddress general issues regarding 3D visualization, such as: load and convert\nastronomy data, perform volume rendering on the GPU, and produce physically\nmeaningful visualizations using principles of visual literacy. We discuss some\nchallenges to be met when designing a user interface that allows us to take\nadvantage of this new way of exploring data. We hope to lay the foundations for\nan innovative framework useful for all astronomers who use spectral line data\ncubes, and encourage interested parties to join our efforts. This pilot project\naddresses the challenges presented by frontier astronomy experiments, such as\nthe Square Kilometre Array and its precursors.\n", "  Algorithms for computing local minima of smooth objective functions enjoy a\nmature theory as well as robust and efficient implementations. By comparison,\nthe theory and practice of saddle search is destitute. In this paper we present\nresults for idealized versions of the dimer and gentlest ascent (GAD) saddle\nsearch algorithms that show-case the limitations of what is theoretically\nachievable within the current class of saddle search algorithms: (1) we present\nan improved estimate on the region of attraction of saddles; and (2) we\nconstruct quasi-periodic solutions which indicate that it is impossible to\nobtain globally convergent variants of dimer and GAD type algorithms.\n", "  The understanding of how the arrangement of defects in photonic crystals\nimpacts its photonic properties is cru-cial for the design of functional\nmaterials based thereon. By preparing photonic crystals with random missing\nscatterers we create crystals where disorder is embodied as vacancies in an\notherwise perfect lattice rather than the usual positional or size disorder. We\nshow that the amount of defects not only determines the intensity but also the\nnature of the light scattering. As the amount of defects varies, light\nscattering undergoes a transition whereby the usual signatures of photonic gaps\n(Bragg peak) suffer line-shape changes (Bragg dip) that can be readily\ndescribed with the Fano resonance q parameter. When the amount of vacancies\nreaches the percolation threshold, q undergoes a sign change signaling the\ntransition from a crystal to a mosaic of microcrystals through a state where\nscattering is maximum. Beyond that point the system reenters a state of low\nscattering that ap-pears in the guise of normal Bragg diffraction.\n", "  In this presentation, we review the general features of integrand-reduction\ntechniques, with a particular focus on their generalization beyond one loop. We\nstart with a brief discussion of the one-loop scenario, a case in which\nintegrand-reduction algorithms are well established and played over the past\ndecade an important role in the development of automated tools for the\ntheoretical evaluation of physical observables. The generalization of\nintegrand-reduction techniques to all loops has been the subject of several\nefforts in the recent past, thus providing a better understanding of the\nuniversal properties of scattering amplitudes. The ultimate goal of these\nstudies is the development of efficient alternative computational techniques\nfor the evaluation of Feynman integrals beyond one loop.\n"]}
