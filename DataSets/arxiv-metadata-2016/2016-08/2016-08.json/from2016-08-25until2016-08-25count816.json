us to present\na unified model of small and high t scattering at high energies. Our model is\nbased upon a safe theoretical ground: analyticity, unitarity, Regge behavior,\ngluon exchange and saturation of bounds established in axiomatic quantum field\ntheory. We make precise predictions for the behavior of the differential cross\nsections at high t, the evolution of the dip-shoulder structure localized in\nthe region of -t between 0.5 and 0.8 GeV**2 and the radical violation of the\nexponential behavior of the first diffraction cone at small t.\n", "  Following Braverman-Finkelberg-Feigin-Rybnikov (arXiv:1008.3655), we study\nthe convolution algebra of a handsaw quiver variety, a.k.a. a parabolic Laumon\nspace, and a finite W-algebra of type A. This is a finite analog of the AGT\nconjecture on 4-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with surface\noperators. Our new observation is that the C^*-fixed point set of a handsaw\nquiver variety is isomorphic to a graded quiver variety of type A, which was\nintroduced by the author in connection with the representation theory of a\nquantum affine algebra. As an application, simple modules of the W-algebra are\ndescribed in terms of IC sheaves of graded quiver varieties of type A, which\nwere known to be related to Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. This gives a new proof\nof a conjecture by Brundan-Kleshchev on composition multiplicities on Verma\nmodules, which was proved by Losev, in a wider context, by a different method.\n", "  We discuss chiral zero-rest-mass field equations on six-dimensional\nspace-time from a twistorial point of view. Specifically, we present a detailed\ncohomological analysis, develop both Penrose and Penrose-Ward transforms, and\nanalyse the corresponding contour integral formulae. We also give twistor space\naction principles. We then dimensionally reduce the twistor space of\nsix-dimensional space-time to obtain twistor formulations of various theories\nin lower dimensions. Besides well-known twistor spaces, we also find a novel\ntwistor space amongst these reductions, which turns out to be suitable for a\ntwistorial description of self-dual strings. For these reduced twistor spaces,\nwe explain the Penrose and Penrose-Ward transforms as well as contour integral\nformulae.\n", "  This paper summarizes a presentation for a panel discussion on \"The Future of\nAstrostatistics\" held at the Statistical Challenges in Modern Astronomy V\nconference at Pennsylvania State University in June 2011. I argue that the\nemerging needs of astrostatistics may both motivate and benefit from\nfundamental developments in statistics. I highlight some recent work within\nstatistics on fundamental topics relevant to astrostatistical practice,\nincluding the Bayesian/frequentist debate (and ideas for a synthesis),\nmultilevel models, and multiple testing. As an important direction for future\nwork in statistics, I emphasize that astronomers need a statistical framework\nthat explicitly supports unfolding chains of discovery, with acquisition,\ncataloging, and modeling of data not seen as isolated tasks, but rather as\nparts of an ongoing, integrated sequence of analyses, with information and\nuncertainty propagating forward and backward through the chain. A prototypical\nexample is surveying of astronomical populations, where source detection,\ndemographic modeling, and the design of survey instruments and strategies all\ninteract.\n", "  We introduce the photonic trumpet, a dielectric structure which ensures a\nnearly perfect coupling between an embedded quantum light source and a Gaussian\nfree-space beam. A photonic trumpet exploits both the broadband spontaneous\nemission control provided by a single-mode photonic wire and the adiabatic\nexpansion of this mode within a conical taper. Numerical simulations highlight\nthe outstanding performance and robustness of this concept. As a first\napplication in the field of quantum optics, we report the realisation of an\nultra-bright single-photon source. The device, a GaAs photonic trumpet\ncontaining few InAs quantum dots, demonstrates a first-lens external efficiency\nof $0.75 \\pm 0.1$.\n", "  Aganagic and Shakirov propose a refinement of the SU(N) Chern-Simons theory\nfor links in three manifolds with S^1-symmetry, such as torus knots in S^3,\nbased on deformation of the S and T matrices, originally found by Kirillov and\nCherednik. We relate the large N limit of the S matrix to the Hilbert schemes\nof points on the affine plane. As an application, we find an explicit formula\nfor the Euler characteristics of the universal sheaf, applied arbitrary Schur\nfunctor.\n", "  Using perturbative renormalization group we investigate the influence of\nrandom velocity field on the critical behavior of directed bond percolation\nprocess near its second-order phase transition between absorbing and active\nphase. Antonov-Kraichnan model with finite correlation time is used for\ndescription of advecting velocity field.\n  The field-theoretic renormalization group approach is applied for getting\ninformation about asymptotic large scale behavior of the model under\nconsideration. The model is analyzed near its critical dimension through\nthree-parameter expansion in {\\epsilon}, {\\delta}, {\\eta}, where {\\epsilon} is\nthe deviation from the Kolmogorov scaling, {\\delta} is the deviation from the\ncritical space dimension {d_c} and {\\eta} is the deviation from the parabolic\ndispersion law for the velocity correlator. Fixed points with corresponding\nregions of stability are determined to the leading order in the perturbation\nscheme.\n", "  Galactic Dark Matter (DM) annihilations can produce cosmic-ray anti-nuclei\nvia the nuclear coalescence of the anti-protons and anti-neutrons originated\ndirectly from the annihilation process. Since anti-deuterons have been shown to\noffer a distinctive DM signal, with potentially good prospects of detection in\nlarge portions of the DM-particle parameter space, we explore here the\nproduction of heavier anti-nuclei, specifically anti-helium. Even more than for\nanti-deuterons, the DM-produced anti-He flux can be mostly prominent over the\nastrophysical anti-He background at low kinetic energies, typically below 3-5\nGeV/n. However, the larger number of anti-nucleons involved in the formation\nprocess makes the anti-He flux extremely small. We therefore explore, for a few\nDM benchmark cases, whether the yield is sufficient to allow for anti-He\ndetection in current-generation experiments, such as AMS-02. We account for the\nuncertainties due to the propagation in the Galaxy and to the uncertain details\nof the coalescence process, and we consider the constraints already imposed by\nanti-proton searches. We find that only for very optimistic configurations it\nmight be possible to achieve detection with current generation detectors. We\nestimate that, in more realistic configurations, an increase in experimental\nsensitivity at low-kinetic energies of about a factor of 500-1000 would allow\nto start probing DM through the rare cosmic anti-He production.\n", "  This paper is based on author's lectures at Kyoto University in 2010 Summer,\nand in the 6th MSJ-SI `Development of Moduli Theory' at RIMS in June 2013.\n  The purpose of lectures was to review several results on Hilbert schemes of\npoints which were obtained after author's lecture note was written. Among many\nresults, we choose those which are about equivariant homology groups\n$H^T_*(X^{[n]})$ of Hilbert schemes of points on the affine plane $X = \\mathbb\nC^2$ with respect to the torus action.\n", "  Let $T_{m,n}$ be toroidal square grid of size $m\\times n$ and let both $m$\nand $n$ be even. Let $P$ be a perfect matching of $T_{m,n}$ and let $D(P)$ be\nthe cycle-rooted spanning forest of $P$ obtained by the generalized Temperley's\nconstruction. The types of $P$ and $D(P)$ in the first homology group\n$H_1(\\mathbb{T},\\mathbb{Z})$ of torus $\\mathbb{T}$ with coefficients in\n$\\mathbb{Z}$ has been extensively studied. In this paper we study the types of\n$P$ and $D(P)$ in the first homology group $H_1(\\mathbb{T},\\mathbb{F}_2)$ with\nthe coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_2$. Our considerations connect two remarkable\nresults concerning perfect matchings of toroidal square grids, namely\nTemperley's bijection and the Arf-invariant formula.\n", "  This study concerned conebeam travel-time tomography. The focus was on a\nsparse distribution of signal sources that can be necessary in a challenging in\nsitu environment such as in asteroid tomography. The goal was to approximate\nthe minimum number of source positions needed for robust detection of\nrefractive anomalies, e.g., voids within an asteroid or a casting defects in\nconcrete. Experimental ultrasonic data were recorded utilizing as a target a\n150 mm plastic cast cube containing three stones with diameter between 22 and\n41 mm. A signal frequency of 55 kHz (35 mm wavelength) was used. Source counts\nfrom one to six were tested for different placements. Based on our statistical\ninversion approach and analysis of the results, three or four sources were\nfound to lead to reliable inversion. The source configurations investigated\nwere also ranked according to their performance. Our results can be used, for\nexample, in the planning of planetary missions as well as in material testing.\n", "  Quantum machine learning has received significant attention in recent years,\nand promising progress has been made in the development of quantum algorithms\nto speed up traditional machine learning tasks. In this work, however, we focus\non investigating the information-theoretic upper bounds of sample complexity -\nhow many training samples are sufficient to predict the future behaviour of an\nunknown target function. This kind of problem is, arguably, one of the most\nfundamental problems in statistical learning theory and the bounds for\npractical settings can be completely characterised by a simple measure of\ncomplexity.\n  Our main result in the paper is that, for learning an unknown quantum\nmeasurement, the upper bound, given by the fat-shattering dimension, is\nlinearly proportional to the dimension of the underlying Hilbert space.\nLearning an unknown quantum state becomes a dual problem to ours, and as a\nbyproduct, we can recover Aaronson's famous result [Proc. R. Soc. A\n463:3089-3144 (2007)] solely using a classical machine learning technique. In\naddition, other famous complexity measures like covering numbers and Rademacher\ncomplexities are derived explicitly. We are able to connect measures of sample\ncomplexity with various areas in quantum information science, e.g. quantum\nstate/measurement tomography, quantum state discrimination and quantum random\naccess codes, which may be of independent interest. Lastly, with the assistance\nof general Bloch-sphere representation, we show that learning quantum\nmeasurements/states can be mathematically formulated as a neural network.\nConsequently, classical ML algorithms can be applied to efficiently accomplish\nthe two quantum learning tasks.\n", "  The van der Waals (VDW) equation of state describes a thermal equilibrium in\nsystem of particles, where both repulsive and attractive interactions between\nthem are included. This equation predicts an existence of the 1st order\nliquid-gas phase transition and the critical point. The standard form of the\nVDW equation is given by the pressure function in the canonical ensemble (CE)\nwith a fixed number of particles. In the present paper the VDW equation is\ntransformed to the grand canonical ensemble (GCE). We argue that this procedure\ncan be useful for new physical applications. Particularly, the fluctuations of\nnumber of particles, which are absent in the CE, can be studied in the GCE. For\nthe VDW equation of state in the GCE the particle number fluctuations are\ncalculated for the whole phase diagram, both outside and inside the liquid-gas\nmixed phase region. It is shown that the scaled variance of these fluctuations\nremains finite within the mixed phase and goes to infinity at the critical\npoint. The GCE formulation of the VDW equation of state can be also an\nimportant step for its application to a statistical description of hadronic\nsystems, where numbers of different particle species are usually not conserved.\n", "  It is a frequent assumption that - via superluminal information transfers -\nsuperluminal signals capable of enabling communication are necessarily\nexchanged in any quantum theory that posits hidden superluminal influences.\nHowever, does the presence of hidden superluminal influences automatically\nimply superluminal signalling and communication? The non-signalling theorem\nmediates the apparent conflict between quantum mechanics and the theory of\nspecial relativity. However, as a 'no-go' theorem there exist two opposing\ninterpretations of the non-signalling constraint: foundational and operational.\nConcerning Bell's theorem, we argue that Bell employed both interpretations at\ndifferent times. Bell finally pursued an explicitly operational position on\nnon-signalling which is often associated with ontological quantum theory, e.g.,\nde Broglie-Bohm theory. This position we refer to as \"effective\nnon-signalling\". By contrast, associated with orthodox quantum mechanics is the\nfoundational position referred to here as \"axiomatic non-signalling\". In search\nof a decisive communication-theoretic criterion for differentiating between\n\"axiomatic\" and \"effective\" non-signalling, we employ the operational framework\noffered by Shannon's mathematical theory of communication. We find that an\neffective non-signalling theorem represents two sub-theorems, which we call (1)\nnon-transfer-control (NTC) theorem, and (2) non-signification-control (NSC)\ntheorem. Employing NTC and NSC theorems, we report that effective, instead of\naxiomatic, non-signalling is entirely sufficient for prohibiting nonlocal\ncommunication. An effective non-signalling theorem allows for nonlocal quantum\ninformation transfer yet - at the same time - effectively denies superluminal\nsignalling and communication.\n", "  We consider an explicit self-similar solution to an energy-supercritical\nYang-Mills equation and prove its mode stability. Based on earlier work by one\nof the authors, we obtain a fully rigorous proof of the nonlinear stability of\nthe self-similar blowup profile. This is a large-data result for a\nsupercritical wave equation. Our method is broadly applicable and provides a\ngeneral approach to stability problems related to self-similar solutions of\nnonlinear wave equations.\n", "  Dirac semi-metals show a linear electronic dispersion in three dimension\ndescribed by two copies of the Weyl equation, a theoretical description of\nmassless relativistic fermions. At the surface of a crystal, the breakdown of\nfermion chirality is expected to produce topological surface states without any\ncounterparts in high-energy physics nor conventional condensed matter systems,\nthe so-called \"Fermi Arcs\". Here we present Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations\ninvolving the Fermi Arc states in Focused Ion Beam prepared microstructures of\nCd$_3$As$_2$. Their unusual magnetic field periodicity and dependence on sample\nthickness can be well explained by recent theoretical work predicting novel\nquantum paths weaving the Fermi Arcs together with chiral bulk states, forming\n\"Weyl orbits\". In contrast to conventional cyclotron orbits, these are governed\nby the chiral bulk dynamics rather than the common momentum transfer due to the\nLorentz force. Our observations provide evidence for direct access to the\ntopological properties of charge in a transport experiment, a first step\ntowards their potential application.\n", "  Buyer--seller relationships among firms can be regarded as a longitudinal\nnetwork in which the connectivity pattern evolves as each firm receives\nproductivity shocks. Based on a data set describing the evolution of\nbuyer--seller links among 55,608 firms over a decade and structural equation\nmodeling, we find some evidence that interfirm networks evolve reflecting a\nfirm's local decisions to mitigate adverse effects from neighbor firms through\ninterfirm linkage, while enjoying positive effects from them. As a result, link\nrenewal tends to have a positive impact on the growth rates of firms. We also\ninvestigate the role of networks in aggregate fluctuations.\n", "  We derive a purely algebraic framework for the identification of hierarchy\nequations of motion that induce completely positive dynamics and demonstrate\nthe applicability of our approach with several examples. We find bounds on the\nviolation of complete positivity for microscopically derived hierarchy\nequations of motion and construct well-behaved phenomenological models with\nstrongly non-Markovian revivals of quantum coherence.\n", "  We show how to obtain concrete constructions of homological quantum codes\nbased on tilings of 2D surfaces with constant negative curvature (hyperbolic\nsurfaces). This construction results in two-dimensional quantum codes whose\ntradeoff of encoding rate versus protection is more favorable than for the\nsurface code. These surface codes would require variable length connections\nbetween qubits, as determined by the hyperbolic geometry. We provide numerical\nestimates of the value of the noise threshold and logical error probability of\nthese codes against independent X or Z noise, assuming noise-free error\ncorrection.\n", "  The need for precise characterization of dual-phase xenon detectors has grown\nas the technology has matured into a state of high efficacy for rare event\nsearches. The Michigan Xenon detector was constructed to study the microphysics\nof particle interactions in liquid xenon across a large energy range in an\neffort to probe aspects of radiation detection in liquid xenon. We report the\ndesign and performance of a small 3D position sensitive dual-phase liquid xenon\ntime projection chamber with high light yield ($L_y^{122}=15.2 $pe/keV at zero\nfield), long electron lifetime ($\\tau > 200 \\mu$s), and excellent energy\nresolution ($\\sigma/E = 1\\%$ for 1,333 keV gamma rays in a drift field of 200\nV/cm). Liquid xenon time projection chambers with such high energy resolution\nmay find applications not only in dark matter direct detection searches, but\nalso in neutrinoless double beta decay experiments and other applications.\n", "  The grand canonical ensemble formulation of the van der Waals equation of\nstate that includes the effects of Bose statistics is applied to an equilibrium\nsystem of interacting pions. If the attractive interaction between pions is\nlarge enough, a limiting temperature $T_0$ emerges, i.e., no thermodynamical\nequilibrium is possible at $T>T_0$. The system pressure $p$, particle number\ndensity $n$, and energy density $\\varepsilon$ remain finite at $T=T_0$, whereas\nfor $T$ near $T_0$ both the specific heat $C=d\\varepsilon/dT$ and the scaled\nvariance of particle number fluctuations $\\omega[N]$ are proportional to\n$(T_0-T)^{-1/2}$ and, thus, go to infinity at $T\\rightarrow T_0$. The limiting\ntemperature corresponds also to the softest point of the equation of state,\ni.e., the speed of sound squared $c_s^2=dp/d\\varepsilon$ goes to zero as\n$(T_0-T)^{1/2}$. Very similar thermodynamical behavior takes place in the\nHagedorn model for the special choice of a power, namely $m^{-4}$, in the\npre-exponential factor of the mass spectrum $\\rho(m)$.\n", "  We analyze a class of quantum spin models defined on half-spaces in the\n$d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice bounded by a hyperplane with inward unit\nnormal vector $m\\in\\mathbb{R}^d$. The family of models was previously\nintroduced as the single species Product Vacua with Boundary States (PVBS)\nmodel, which is a spin-$1/2$ model with a XXZ-type nearest neighbor\ninteractions depending on parameters $\\lambda_j\\in (0,\\infty)$, one for each\ncoordinate direction. For any given values of the parameters, we prove an upper\nbound for the spectral gap above the unique ground state of these models, which\nvanishes for exactly one direction of the normal vector $m$. For all other\nchoices of $m$ we derive a positive lower bound of the spectral gap, except for\nthe case $\\lambda_1 =\\cdots =\\lambda_d=1$, which is known to have gapless\nexcitations in the bulk.\n", "  Using criteria of bandwidth and energy consumption for signal guiding and\nprocessing, system-level figures of merit for both passive and active plasmonic\ncircuit components are introduced, benchmarking their performance for the\nrealisation of high-bandwidth optical data communication on a chip. The figure\nof merit for passive plasmonic interconnects has been derived in terms of the\nsystem level performance of the plasmonic circuitry, emphasising the bandwidth\nand power consumption densities. These parameters are linked to the local\nwaveguide characteristics, such as the mode propagation length, bend radius and\nmode size. The figure of merit enables a comparison of the main types of\nplasmonic waveguides and can serve as a benchmark for future designs of\nphotonic integrated circuits. A figure of merit for active photonic- or\nplasmonic-based electro-optical, thermo-optical and all-optical modulators is\nalso derived to reflect the same benchmarking principles. A particular emphasis\nis made on establishing a practically oriented benchmark where the integral\nperformance of the circuit, not the size or energy consumption of individual\ncomponents, plays the defining role.\n", "  We present the results of the quest for ring-type structures on the maps\nobserved by the Planck satellite. The results show that the vicinity of one\nradius ({\\gamma} = 0.14 radians) of the rings is distinguished. Twisting the\ncircles into deformed ellipses gives a pronounced drop of significance with the\nincrease of twisting.\n", "  Many difficulties are encountered when attempting to pinpoint a common origin\nfor several observed astrophysical anomalies, and when assessing their tension\nwith existing exclusion limits. These include systematic uncertainties\naffecting the operation of the detectors, our knowledge of their response,\nastrophysical uncertainties, and the broad range of particle couplings that can\nmediate interaction with a detector target. Particularly interesting\nastrophysical evidence has motivated a search for dark-photon, and focused our\nattention on a Hidden Valleys model with a GeV-scale dark sector that produces\nexciting signatures. Results from recent underground experiments are also\nconsidered. There is a `light' hidden sector (dark sector), present in many\nmodels of new physics beyond the Standard Model, which contains a colorful\nspectrum of new particles. Recently, it has been shown that this spectrum can\ngive rise to unique signatures at colliders when the mass scale in the hidden\nsector is well below a TeV; as in Hidden Valleys, Stueckelberg extensions, and\nUnparticle models. These physics models produce unique signatures of collimated\nleptons at high energies. By studying these ephemeral particles we hope to\ntrace the history of the Universe. Our present theories lead us to believe that\nthere is something new just around the corner, which should be accessible at\nthe energies made available by modern colliders.\n", "  We propose a versatile platform to investigate the existence of Majorana\nbound states (MBSs) and their non-Abelian statistics through braiding. This\nimplementation combines a two-dimensional electron gas formed in a\nsemiconductor quantum well grown on the surface of an s-wave superconductor\nwith a nearby array of magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). The underlying\nmagnetic textures produced by MTJs provide highly controllable topological\nphase transitions to confine and transport MBSs in two dimensions, overcoming\nthe requirement for a network of wires. Obtained scaling relations confirm that\nvarious semiconductor quantum well materials are suitable for this proposal.\n", "  In this work we obtain the non-abelian T-dual geometry of the well-known\nPilch-Warner supergravity solution in its infrared point. We derive the dual\nmetric and the NS two-form by gauging the isometry group of the initial theory\nand integrating out the introduced auxiliary gauge fields. Then we use the\nFourier-Mukai transform from algebraic geometry to find the transformation\nrules of the R-R fields. The dual background preserves the $\\mathcal{N}=1$\nsupersymmetry of the original one due to the fact that the Killing spinor does\nnot depend on the directions on which the N-AT-D is performed. Finally, we\nconsider two different pp-wave limits of the T-dual geometry by performing\nPenrose limits for two light-like geodesics.\n", "  The spectrum of relic gravitational wave (RGW) contains high-frequency\ndivergences, which should be removed. We present a systematic study of the\nissue, based on the exact RGW solution that covers the five stages, from\ninflation to the acceleration, each being a power law expansion. We show that\nthe present RGW consists of vacuum dominating at $f>10^{11}$Hz and graviton\ndominating at $f<10^{11}$Hz, respectively. The gravitons are produced by the\nfour cosmic transitions, mostly by the inflation-reheating one. We perform\nadiabatic regularization to remove vacuum divergences in three schemes: at\npresent, at the end of inflation, and at horizon-exit, to the 2-nd adiabatic\norder for the spectrum, and the 4-th order for energy density and pressure. In\nthe first scheme a cutoff is needed to remove graviton divergences. We find\nthat all three schemes yield the spectra of a similar profile, and the\nprimordial spectrum defined far outside horizon during inflation is practically\nunaffected. We also regularize the gauge-invariant perturbed inflaton and the\nscalar curvature perturbation by the last two schemes, and find that the scalar\nspectra, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the consistency relation remain\nunchanged.\n", "  Graphene is a carbon molecule with the structure of a honeycomb lattice. We\nshow how this structure can arise in two dimensions as the minimizer of an\ninteraction energy with two-body and three-body terms. In the engineering\nliterature, the Brenner potential is commonly used to describe the interactions\nbetween carbon atoms. We consider a potential of Stillinger-Weber type that\nincorporates certain characteristics of the Brenner potential: the preferred\nbond angles are 180 degrees and all interactions have finite range. We show\nthat the thermodynamic limit of the ground state energy per particle is the\nsame as that of a honeycomb lattice. We also prove that, subject to periodic\nboundary conditions, the minimizers are translated versions of the honeycomb\nlattice.\n", "  Phase diagram of a discrete counterpart of the classical Heisenberg model,\nthe truncated tetrahedral model, is analyzed on the square lattice, when the\ninteraction is ferromagnetic. Each spin is represented by a unit vector that\ncan point to one of the 12 vertices of the truncated tetrahedron, which is a\ncontinuous interpolation between the tetrahedron and the octahedron. Phase\ndiagram of the model is determined by means of the statistical analogue of the\nentanglement entropy, which is numerically calculated by the corner transfer\nmatrix renormalization group method. The obtained phase diagram consists of\nfour different phases, which are separated by five transition lines. In the\nparameter region, where the octahedral anisotropy is dominant, a weak\nfirst-order phase transition is observed.\n", "  In ferromagnet/normal metal heterostructures, spin pumping and spin-transfer\ntorques are two reciprocal processes that occur concomitantly. Their interplay\nintroduces a dynamic feedback effect interconnecting energy dissipation\nchannels of both magnetization and current. By solving the spin diffusion\nprocess in the presence of the spin Hall effect in the normal metal, we show\nthat the dynamic feedback gives rise to: (i) a nonlinear magnetic damping that\nis crucial to sustain uniform steady-state oscillations of a spin Hall\noscillator at large angles. (ii) a frequency dependent spin Hall\nmagnetoimpedance that reduces to the spin Hall magnetoresistance in the dc\nlimit.\n", "  We show that by integrating out the electric field and incorporating proper\nboundary conditions, a semiclassical Boltzmann equation can describe electron\ntransport properties, continuously from the diffusive to ballistic regimes.\nGeneral analytical formulas of the conductance in $D=1,2,3$ dimensions are\nobtained, which recover the Boltzmann-Drude formula and Landauer-B\\\"uttiker\nformula in the diffusive and ballistic limits, respectively. This intuitive and\nefficient approach can be applied to investigate the interplay of system size\nand impurity scattering in various charge and spin transport phenomena.\n", "  The equations of motion of lossless compressible nonclassical fluids under\nthe so-called Green--Naghdi theory are considered for two classes of barotropic\nfluids: (\\textit{i}) perfect gases and (\\textit{ii}) liquids obeying a\nquadratic equation of state. An exact reduction in terms of a scalar acoustic\npotential and the (scalar) thermal displacement is achieved. Properties and\nsimplifications of these model nonlinear acoustic equations for unidirectional\nflows are noted. Specifically, the requirement that the governing system of\nequations for such flows remain hyperbolic is shown to lead to restrictions on\nthe physical parameters and/or applicability of the model. A weakly nonlinear\nmodel is proposed on the basis of neglecting only terms proportional to the\nsquare of the Mach number in the governing equations, without any further\napproximation or modification of the nonlinear terms. Shock formation via\nacceleration wave blowup is studied numerically in a one-dimensional context\nusing a high-resolution Godunov-type finite-volume scheme, thereby verifying\nprior analytical results on the blowup time and contrasting these results with\nthe corresponding ones for classical (Euler) fluids.\n", "  We demonstrate theoretically all-electric control of the superconducting\ntransition temperature using a device comprised of a conventional\nsuperconductor, a ferromagnetic insulator, and semiconducting layers with\nintrinsic spin-orbit coupling. By using analytical calculations and numerical\nsimulations, we show that the transition temperature of such a device can be\ncontrolled by electric gating which alters the ratio of Rashba to Dresselhaus\nspin-orbit coupling. The results offer a new pathway to control\nsuperconductivity in spintronic devices.\n", "  Taking partial traces for computing reduced density matrices, or related\nfunctions, is a ubiquitous procedure in the quantum mechanics of composite\nsystems. In this article, we present a thorough description of this function\nand analyze the number of elementary operations (ops) needed, under some\npossible alternative implementations, to compute it on a classical computer. As\nwe notice, it is worthwhile doing some analytical developments in order to\navoid making null multiplications and sums, what can considerably reduce the\nops. For instance, for a bipartite system\n$\\mathcal{H}_{a}\\otimes\\mathcal{H}_{b}$ with dimensions\n$d_{a}=\\dim\\mathcal{H}_{a}$ and $d_{b}=\\dim\\mathcal{H}_{b}$ and for\n$d_{a},d_{b}\\gg1$, while a direct use of partial trace definition applied to\n$\\mathcal{H}_{b}$ requires $\\mathcal{O}(d_{a}^{6}d_{b}^{6})$ ops, its optimized\nimplementation entails $\\mathcal{O}(d_{a}^{2}d_{b})$ ops. In the sequence, we\nregard the computation of partial traces for general multipartite systems and\ndescribe Fortran code provided to implement it numerically. We also consider\nthe calculation of reduced density matrices via Bloch's parametrization with\ngeneralized Gell Mann's matrices.\n", "  In this work, we perform a careful study of an special arrangement of coupled\nsystems that consists of two external harmonic oscillators weakly coupled to an\narbitrary network (data bus) of strongly interacting oscillators. Our aim is to\nestablish simple effective Hamiltonians and Liouvillians allowing an accurate\ndescription of the dynamics of the external oscillators regardless the topology\nof the network. By simple we mean an effective description using just a few\ndegrees of freedom. In order to do that, we employed the machinery of\nsymplectic formalism to generalize and expand the ideas presented in [1], where\nthe specific case of an isolated (no thermal baths) chain is treated. With the\nmethodology developed here, we are able to treat general topologies and, under\ncertain structural conditions, to also include the interaction with external\nenvironments. In order to illustrate the predictability of the simplified\ndynamics, we present a comparative study with the predictions of the\nnumerically obtained exact description in the context of propagation of energy\nthrough the network.\n", "  We derive new characterisations of the matrix $\\mathrm{\\Phi}$-entropy\nfunctionals introduced in [Electron.~J.~Probab., 19(20): 1--30, 2014]. Notably,\nall known equivalent characterisations of the classical $\\Phi$-entropies have\ntheir matrix correspondences. Next, we propose an operator-valued\ngeneralisation of the matrix $\\Phi$-entropy functionals, and prove their\nsubadditivity under L\\\"owner partial ordering. Our results demonstrate that the\nsubadditivity of operator-valued $\\Phi$-entropies is equivalent to the\nconvexity of various related functions. This result can be used to demonstrate\nan interesting result in quantum information theory: the matrix $\\Phi$-entropy\nof a quantum ensemble is monotone under unital quantum channels. Finally, we\nderive the operator Efron-Stein inequality to bound the operator-valued\nvariance of a random matrix.\n", "  We investigate the absorption properties of graphene-based anisotropic\nmetamaterial structures where the metamaterial layer possesses an\nelectromagnetic response corresponding to a near-zero permittivity. We find\nthat through analytical and numerical studies, near perfect absorption arises\nover an unusually broad range of beam incidence angles. Due to the presence of\ngraphene, the absorption is tunable via a gate voltage, providing dynamic\ncontrol of the energy transmission. We show that this strongly enhanced\nabsorption arises due to a coupling between light and a fast wave-mode\npropagating along the graphene/metamaterial hybrid.\n", "  We study the relation between flow structure and fluid deformation in steady\ntwo-dimensional random flows. Beyond the linear (shear flow) and exponential\n(chaotic flow) elongation paradigms, we find a broad spectrum of stretching\nbehaviors, ranging from sub- to superlinear, which are dominated by\nintermittent shear events. We analyze these behaviors from first principles,\nwhich uncovers stretching as a result of the non-linear coupling between\nLagrangian shear deformation and velocity fluctuations along streamlines. We\nderive explicit expressions for Lagrangian deformation and demonstrate that\nstretching obeys a coupled continous time random walk, which for broad\ndistributions of flow velocities describes a L\\'evy walk for elongation. The\nderived model provides a direct link between the flow and deformation\nstatistics, and a natural way to quantify the impact of intermittent shear\nevents on the stretching behavior, which can have strong anomalous diffusive\ncharacter.\n", "  The paper presents the project of an open source C/C++ library of analytical\nsolutions to micromechanical fields within media with ellipsoidal\nheterogeneities. The solutions are based on Eshelby's stress-free, in general\npolynomial, eigenstrains and equivalent inclusion method. To some extent, the\ninteractions among inclusions in a non-dilute medium are taken into account by\nmeans of the self-compatibility algorithm. Moreover, the library is furnished\nwith a powerful I/O interface and conventional homogenization tools. Advantages\nand limitations of the implemented strategies are addressed through comparisons\nwith reference solutions by means of the Finite Element Method.\n", "  Significant X-ray variability and flaring has been observed from Sgr A* but\nis poorly understood from a theoretical standpoint. We perform GRMHD\nsimulations that take into account a population of non-thermal electrons with\nenergy distributions and injection rates that are motivated by PIC simulations\nof magnetic reconnection. We explore the effects of including these non-thermal\nelectrons on the predicted broadband variability of Sgr A* and find that X-ray\nvariability is a generic result of localizing non-thermal electrons to highly\nmagnetized regions, where particles are likely to be accelerated via magnetic\nreconnection. The proximity of these high-field regions to the event horizon\nforms a natural connection between IR and X-ray variability and accounts for\nthe rapid timescales associated with the X-ray flares. The qualitative nature\nof this variability is consistent with observations, producing X-ray flares\nthat are always coincident with IR flares, but not vice versa, i.e., there are\na number of IR flares without X-ray counterparts.\n", "  The boundary between classical and quantum correlations is well characterised\nby linear constraints called Bell inequalities. It is much harder to\ncharacterise the boundary of the quantum set itself in the space of\nno-signaling correlations. For the points on the quantum boundary that violate\nmaximally some Bell inequalities, Oppenheim and Wehner [Science 330, 1072\n(2010)] pointed out a complex property: the optimal measurements of Alice steer\nBob's local state to the eigenstate of an effective operator corresponding to\nits maximal eigenvalue. This effective operator is the linear combination of\nBob's local operators induced by the coefficients of the Bell inequality, and\nit can be interpreted as defining a fine-grained uncertainty relation. It is\nnatural to ask whether the same property holds for other points on the quantum\nboundary, using the Bell expression that defines the tangent hyperplane at each\npoint. We prove that this is indeed the case for a large set of points,\nincluding some that were believed to provide counterexamples. The price to pay\nis to acknowledge that the Oppenheim-Wehner criterion does not respect\nequivalence under the no-signaling constraint: for each point, one has to look\nfor specific forms of writing the Bell expressions.\n", "  Magellanic spiral galaxies are a class of one-armed systems that often\nexhibit an offset stellar bar, and are rarely found around massive spiral\ngalaxies. Using a set of N-body and hydrodynamic simulations we consider a\ndwarf-dwarf galaxy interaction as the driving mechanism for the formation of\nthis peculiar class of systems. We investigate here the relation between the\ndynamical, stellar and gaseous disk center and the bar. In all our simulations\nthe bar center always coincides with the dynamical center, while the stellar\ndisk becomes highly asymmetric during the encounter causing the photometric\ncenter of the Magellanic galaxy disk to become mismatched with both the bar and\nthe dynamical center. The disk asymmetries persist for almost 2 Gyrs, the time\nthat it takes for the disk to be re-centered with the bar, and well after the\ncompanion has passed. This explains the nature of the offset bar found in many\nMagellanic-type galaxies, including the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and NGC\n3906. In particular, these results, once applied to the LMC, suggest that the\ndynamical center should reside in the bar center instead of the HI center as\npreviously assumed, pointing to a variation in the current estimate of the\nnorth component of the LMC proper motion.\n", "  Community detection techniques are widely used to infer hidden structures\nwithin interconnected systems. Despite demonstrating high accuracy on\nbenchmarks, they reproduce the external classification for many real-world\nsystems with a significant level of discrepancy. A widely accepted reason\nbehind such outcome is the unavoidable loss of non-topological information\n(such as node attributes) encountered when the original complex system is\nrepresented as a network. In this article we emphasize that the observed\ndiscrepancies may also be caused by a different reason: the external\nclassification itself. For this end we use scientific publication data which i)\nexhibit a well defined modular structure and ii) hold an expert-made\nclassification of research articles. Having represented the articles and the\nextracted scientific concepts both as a bipartite network and as its unipartite\nprojection, we applied modularity optimization to uncover the inner thematic\nstructure. The resulting clusters are shown to partly reflect the author-made\nclassification, although some significant discrepancies are observed. A\ndetailed analysis of these discrepancies shows that they carry essential\ninformation about the system, mainly related to the use of similar techniques\nand methods across different (sub)disciplines, that is otherwise omitted when\nonly the external classification is considered.\n", "  We obtain lower bounds on the inverse compressibility of systems whose\nLee-Yang zeros of the grand-canonical partition function lie in the left half\nof the complex fugacity plane. This includes in particular systems whose zeros\nlie on the negative real axis such as the monomer-dimer system on a lattice. We\nalso study the virial expansion of the pressure in powers of the density for\nsuch systems. We find no direct connection between the positivity of the virial\ncoefficients and the negativity of the L-Y zeros, and provide examples of\neither one or both properties holding. An explicit calculation of the partition\nfunction of the monomer-dimer system on 2 rows shows that there are at most a\nfinite number of negative virial coefficients in this case.\n", "  The performance of thermoelectric energy harvesters can be improved by\nnanostructures that exploit inelastic transport processes. One prototype is the\nthree-terminal hopping thermoelectric device where electron hopping between\nquantum-dots are driven by hot phonons. Such three-terminal hopping\nthermoelectric devices have potential in achieving high efficiency or power via\ninelastic transport and without relying on heavy-elements or toxic compounds.\nWe show in this work how output power of the device can be optimized via tuning\nthe number and energy configuration of the quantum-dots embedded in parallel\nnanowires. We find that the staircase energy configuration with constant\nenergy-step can improve the power factor over a serial connection of a single\npair of quantum-dots. Moreover, for a fixed energy-step, there is an optimal\nlength for the nanowire. Similarly for a fixed number of quantum-dots there is\nan optimal energy-step for the output power. Our results are important for\nfuture developments of high-performance nanostructured thermoelectric devices.\n", "  The $S$-wave eigenstates of tetraquarks of type $s u \\bar d \\bar b$ with\nJ$^{P}$ = 0$^{+}$, 1$^{+}$ and 2$^{+}$ are studied within a simple quark model\nwith chromomagnetic interaction and effective quark masses extracted from meson\nand baryon spectra. It is tempting to see if this spectrum can accommodate the\nnew narrow structure X(5568), observed by the D\\O~~Collaboration, but not\nconfirmed by the LHCb Collaboration. If it exists, such a tetraquark is a\nsystem with four different flavors and its study can improve our understanding\nof multiquark systems. The presently calculated mass of X(5568) agrees quite\nwell with the experimental value of he D\\O~~Collaboration. Predictions are made\nfor the spectrum of the charmed partner $s u \\bar d \\bar c$. However we are\naware of the difficulty of extracting effective quark masses, from mesons and\nbaryons, to be used in multiquark systems.\n", "  Electric control of magnetic properties is an important challenge for modern\nmagnetism and spintronic development. In particular, an ability to write\nmagnetic state electrically would be highly beneficial. Among other methods,\nthe use of electric field induced deformation of piezoelectric elements is a\npromising low-energy approach for magnetization control. We investigate the\nsystem of piezoelectric substrate Pb[Zr$_x$Ti$_{1-x}$]O$_3$ with CoFe\noverlayers, extending the known reversible bistable electro-magnetic coupling\nto surface and multistate operations, adding the initial state reset\npossibility. Increasing the CoFe thickness improves the magnetoresistive\nsensitivity, but at the expenses of decreasing the strain-mediated coupling,\nwith optimum magnetic thin film thickness of the order of 100 nm. The simplest\nresistance strain gauge structure is realized and discussed as a multistate\nmemory cell demonstrating both resistive memory (RRAM) and magnetoresistive\nmemory (MRAM) functionalities in a single structure.\n", "  We investigate the particle production due to parametric resonances in model\nof inflation where the lightest composite state stemming from the minimal\nwalking technicolor theory plays the role of the inflaton. For model of\ninflation, the effective theory couples non-minimally to gravity. Regarding the\npreheating, we study in details a model of a composite inflaton field $\\phi$\ncoupled to another scalar field $\\chi$ with the interaction term\n$g^{2}\\phi^{2}\\chi^{2}$. Particularly, in the Minkowski space, the stage of\nparametric resonances can be described by the Mathieu equation. Interestingly,\nwe discover that broad resonances can be typically achieved and potentially\nefficient in our model causing the number of particle density in this process\nexponentially increases.\n", "  We study the Universe at the late stage of its evolution and deep inside the\ncell of uniformity. At such a scale the Universe is highly inhomogeneous and\nfilled with discretely distributed inhomogeneities in the form of galaxies and\ngroups of galaxies. As a matter source, we consider dark matter (DM) and dark\nenergy (DE) with a non-linear interaction $Q = 3\\mathcal{H}\\gamma\n\\bar\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{DE}} \\bar\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{DM}} /\n(\\bar\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{DE}} + \\bar\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{DM}})$, where\n$\\gamma$ is a constant. We assume that DM is pressureless and DE has a constant\nequation of state parameter $w$. In the considered model, the energy densities\nof the dark sector components present a scaling behaviour with\n$\\bar\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{DM}} / \\bar\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{DE}} \\sim \\left({a_0}\n/ {a} \\right)^{-3(w+\\gamma)}$. We investigate the possibility that the\nperturbations of DM and DE, which are interacting among themselves, could be\ncoupled to the galaxies with the former being concentrated around them. To\ncarry our analysis, we consider the theory of scalar perturbations (within the\nmechanical approach), and obtain the sets of parameters $(w,\\gamma)$ which do\nnot contradict it. We conclude that two sets: $(w=-2/3,\\gamma=1/3)$ and\n$(w=-1,\\gamma=1/3)$ are of special interest. First, the energy densities of DM\nand DE on these cases are concentrated around galaxies confirming that they are\ncoupled fluids. Second, we show that for both of them, the coincidence problem\nis less severe than in the standard $\\Lambda$CDM. Third, the set\n$(w=-1,\\gamma=1/3)$ is within the observational constraints. Finally, we also\nobtain an expression for the gravitational potential in the considered model.\n", "  We investigate the influence of time-varying environmental noise, i.e.,\ntemporal disorder, on the nonequilibrium phase transition of the contact\nprocess. Combining a real-time renormalization group, scaling theory, and large\nscale Monte-Carlo simulations in one and two dimensions, we show that the\ntemporal disorder gives rise to an exotic critical point. At criticality, the\neffective noise amplitude diverges with increasing time scale, and the\nprobability distribution of the density becomes infinitely broad, even on a\nlogarithmic scale. Moreover, the average density and survival probability decay\nonly logarithmically with time. This infinite-noise critical behavior can be\nunderstood as the temporal counterpart of infinite-randomness critical behavior\nin spatially disordered systems, but with exchanged roles of space and time. We\nalso analyze the generality of our results, and we discuss potential\nexperiments.\n", "  We show that the interaction of an oil-dispersed colloidal particle with an\noil-water interface is highly tunable from attractive to repulsive, either by\nvarying the sign of the colloidal charge via charge regulation, or by varying\nthe difference in hydrophilicity between the dissolved cations and anions. In\naddition, we investigate the yet unexplored interplay between the\nself-regulated colloidal surface charge distribution with the planar double\nlayer across the oil-water interface and the spherical one around the colloid.\nOur findings explain recent experiments and have direct relevance for tunable\nPickering emulsions.\n", "  The Robust Conjugate Direction Search (RCDS) method is used to optimize the\ncollimation system for Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS) of the Chinese\nSpallation Neutron Source (CSNS). The parameters of secondary collimators are\noptimized for a better performance of the collimation system. To improve the\nefficiency of the optimization, the Objective Ring Beam Injection and Tracking\n(ORBIT) parallel module combined with MATLAB parallel computing is used, which\ncan run multiple ORBIT instances simultaneously. This study presents a way to\nfigure out an optimal parameter combination of the secondary collimators for a\nmachine model in preparation for CSNS/RCS commissioning.\n", "  This paper presents an analysis and some interesting observations regarding\nthe classical electromagnetic background to the heating of gold nanoparticles\n(GNPs) in the radio frequency spectrum. Here, it is assumed that the related\ndipole effects are based solely on homogeneous conducting nanospheres that are\nimmersed in an lossy medium. From this point of view it is concluded that the\neffect of using a capacitive coupling i.e., a strong electric field to induce\nelectric dipoles can be disregarded unless the volume fraction of the GNPs is\nunrealistically high, or if there are some other electric dipole mechanisms\npresent which are not taken into account here, such as e.g., with nanospheres\ncoated with ligands providing an electrophoretic movement and associated\nresonances. On the other hand, a simplified quasi-magnetostatic analysis\nindicates that an inductive heating (induced eddy currents inside the metal\nparticles) based on magnetic coupling may have the potential to significantly\nincrease the heating locally provided that the supplied magnetic field can be\nmade sufficiently strong at radio frequency. This paper presents a near field\noptimization approach to study the electromagnetic heating of conductive\nnanoparticles. An optimization problem is formulated where the power absorption\ninside the nanoparticles is maximized subjected to power constraints related to\nthe skin effect in the surrounding medium. The analysis shows that when the\nexterior medium is modelled as salty water the skin effect in the bulk material\nwill render the simple principle of inductive heating of GNPs practically\nuseless at 13.56 MHz.\n", "  The single-band current-dipole Kubo formula for the dynamical conductivity of\nheavily doped graphene from Kup\\v{c}i\\'{c} [Phys. Rev. B 91, 205428 (2015)] is\nextended to a two-band model for conduction $\\pi$ electrons in lightly doped\ngraphene. Using a posteriori relaxation-time approximation in the two-band\nquantum transport equations, with two different relaxation rates and one\nquasi-particle lifetime, we explain a seemingly inconsistent dependence of the\ndc conductivity $\\sigma^{\\rm dc}_{\\alpha \\alpha}$ of ultraclean and dirty\nlightly doped graphene samples on electron doping, in a way consistent with the\ncharge continuity equation. It is also shown that the intraband contribution to\nthe effective number of conduction electrons in $\\sigma^{\\rm dc}_{\\alpha\n\\alpha}$ vanishes at $T=0$ K in the ultraclean regime, but it remains finite in\nthe dirty regime. The present model is shown to be consistent with a picture in\nwhich the intraband and interband contributions to $\\sigma^{\\rm dc}_{\\alpha\n\\alpha}$ are characterized by two different mobilities of conduction electrons,\nthe values of which are well below the widely accepted value of mobility in\nultraclean graphene. The dispersions of Dirac and $\\pi$ plasmon resonances are\nreexamined to show that the present, relatively simple expression for the\ndynamical conductivity tensor can be used to study simultaneously\nsingle-particle excitations in the dc and optical conductivity and collective\nexcitations in energy loss spectroscopy experiments.\n", "  We develop a description of higher gauge theory with higher groupoids as\ngauge structure from first principles. This approach captures ordinary gauge\ntheories and gauged sigma models as well as their categorifications on a very\ngeneral class of (higher) spaces comprising presentable differentiable stacks,\nas e.g. orbifolds. We start off with a self-contained review on simplicial sets\nas models of $(\\infty,1)$-categories. We then discuss principal bundles in\nterms of simplicial maps and their homotopies. We explain in detail a\ndifferentiation procedure, suggested by Severa, that maps higher groupoids to\n$L_\\infty$-algebroids. Generalising this procedure, we define connections for\nhigher groupoid bundles. As an application, we obtain six-dimensional\nsuperconformal field theories via a Penrose-Ward transform of higher groupoid\nbundles over a twistor space. This construction reduces the search for\nnon-Abelian self-dual tensor field equations in six dimensions to a search for\nthe appropriate (higher) gauge structure. The treatment aims to be accessible\nto theoretical physicists.\n", "  We analyze the corrections caused by finite size effects upon the ground\nstate properties of a homogeneous one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. We\nassume from the very beginning that the Bogoliubov's formalism is valid and\nconsequently we show that in order to obtain a well defined ground state\nproperties, finite size effects of the system must be taken into account.\nIndeed, the formalism described in the present work allows to recover the usual\nproperties related to the ground state of a homogeneous one-dimensional\nBose-Einstein condensate but corrected by finite size effects of the system.\nFinally, this scenario allows us to analyze the sensitivity of the system when\nthe Bogoliubov's regime is valid and when finite size effects are present.\nThese facts open the possibility to apply these ideas to more realistic\nscenarios, e.g., low-dimensional trapped Bose-Einstein condensates.\n", "  The Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) theory allows one to separate\ncontextuality from context-dependent errors and violations of selective\ninfluences (aka \"no-signaling\" or \"no-disturbance\" principles). This makes the\ntheory especially applicable to behavioral systems, where violations of\nselective influences are ubiquitous. For cyclic systems with binary random\nvariables, CbD provides necessary and sufficient conditions for\nnoncontextuality, and these conditions are known to be breached in certain\nquantum systems. We apply the theory of cyclic systems to a psychophysical\ndouble-detection experiment, in which observers were asked to determine\npresence or absence of a signal property in each of two simultaneously\npresented stimuli. The results, as in all other behavioral and social systems\nprevious analyzed, indicate lack of contextuality. The role of context in\ndouble-detection is confined to lack of selectiveness: the distribution of\nresponses to one of the stimuli is influenced by the state of the other\nstimulus.\n", "  The Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) theory allows one to separate\ncontextuality from context-dependent errors and violations of selective\ninfluences (aka \"no-signaling\" or \"no-disturbance\" principles).

The trivialization of the cotangent bundle of a matched\npair Lie group are presented. On the trivialized space, the canonical\nsymplectic two-form and canonical Poisson bracket are explicitly written.\nVarious symplectic and Poisson reductions are perfomed. The Lie-Poisson bracket\nis derived. As an example, Lie-Poisson equations on\n$\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb{C})^\\ast$ are obtained.\n", "  The MoEDAL experiment is designed to search for magnetic monopoles and other\nhighly-ionising particles produced in high-energy collisions at the LHC. The\nlargely passive MoEDAL detector, deployed at Interaction Point 8 on the LHC\nring, relies on two dedicated direct detection techniques. The first technique\nis based on stacks of nuclear-track detectors with surface area $\\sim$18 m$^2$,\nsensitive to particle ionisation exceeding a high threshold. These detectors\nare analysed offline by optical scanning microscopes. The second technique is\nbased on the trapping of charged particles in an array of roughly 800 kg of\naluminium samples. These samples are monitored offline for the presence of\ntrapped magnetic charge at a remote superconducting magnetometer facility. We\npresent here the results of a search for magnetic monopoles using a 160 kg\nprototype MoEDAL trapping detector exposed to 8 TeV proton-proton collisions at\nthe LHC, for an integrated luminosity of 0.75 fb$^{-1}$. No magnetic charge\nexceeding $0.5g_{\\rm D}$ (where $g_{\\rm D}$ is the Dirac magnetic charge) is\nmeasured in any of the exposed samples, allowing limits to be placed on\nmonopole production in the mass range 100 GeV$\\leq m \\leq$ 3500 GeV.\nModel-independent cross-section limits are presented in fiducial regions of\nmonopole energy and direction for $1g_{\\rm D}\\leq|g|\\leq 6g_{\\rm D}$, and\nmodel-dependent cross-section limits are obtained for Drell-Yan pair production\nof spin-1/2 and spin-0 monopoles for $1g_{\\rm D}\\leq|g|\\leq 4g_{\\rm D}$. Under\nthe assumption of Drell-Yan cross sections, mass limits are derived for\n$|g|=2g_{\\rm D}$ and $|g|=3g_{\\rm D}$ for the first time at the LHC, surpassing\nthe results from previous collider experiments.\n", "  Motivated by the possible di-gamma resonance at 750 GeV, we present a basis\nof effective operators for the Standard Model plus a scalar singlet at\ndimensions 5, 6, and 7. We point out that an earlier list at dimensions 5 and 6\ncontains two redundant operators at dimension 5.\n", "  A highly efficient, practical approach to high-energy terahertz (THz)\ngeneration based on spectrally cascaded optical parametric amplification\n(THz-COPA) is introduced. The THz wave initially generated by difference\nfrequency generation between a strong narrowband optical pump and optical seed\n(0.1-10% of pump energy) kick-starts a repeated or cascaded energy\ndown-conversion of pump photons. This helps to greatly surpass the\nquantum-defect efficiency and results in exponential growth of THz energy over\ncrystal length. In cryogenically cooled periodically poled lithium niobate,\nenergy conversion efficiencies >8% for 100 ps pulses are predicted. The\ncalculations account for cascading effects, absorption, dispersion and\nlaser-induced damage. Due to the coupled nonlinear interaction of multiple\ntriplets of waves, THz-COPA exhibits physics distinct from conventional\nthree-wave mixing parametric amplifiers. This in turn governs optimal\nphase-matching conditions, evolution of optical spectra as well as limitations\nof the nonlinear process.\n", "  The ensemble of antagonistic matrices is introduced and studied. In\nantagonistic matrices the entries $\\mathcal A_{i,j}$ and $\\mathcal A_{j,i}$ are\nreal and have opposite signs, or are both zero, and the diagonal is zero. This\ngeneralization of antisymmetric matrices is suggested by the linearized\ndynamics of competitive species in ecology.\n", "  Nuclear pores have an approximately uniform distribution in the nuclear\nenvelope of most living cells. Hence, the morphology of the nuclear envelope is\na spherical stomatocyte with a high genus. We have investigated the morphology\nof high-genus vesicles under pore-size constraint using dynamically\ntriangulated membrane simulations. Bending-energy minimization without volume\nor other constraints produces a circular-cage stomatocyte, where the pores are\naligned in a circular line on an oblate bud. As the pore radius is reduced, the\ncircular-pore alignment is more stabilized than a random pore distribution on a\nspherical bud. However, we have clarified the conditions for the formation of a\nspherical stomatocyte: a small perinuclear volume, osmotic pressure within\nnucleoplasm, and repulsion between the pores. When area-difference elasticity\nis taken into account, the formation of cylindrical or budded tubules from the\nstomatocyte and discoidal stomatocyte is found.\n", "  We use liquid state theory and computer simulations to gain insights into the\nshape of the structure factor for fluids of particles interacting via a\ncombination of short-range attractions and long-range repulsions. Such systems\ncan reversibly morph between homogeneous phases and states comprising compact\nself-limiting clusters. We first highlight trends with respect to the presence\nand location of the intermediate-range order (IRO) pre-peak in the structure\nfactor, which is commonly associated with clustering, for wide ranges of the\ntunable parameters that control interparticle interactions (e.g., Debye\nscreening length). Next, for approximately 100 different cluster phases at\nvarious conditions (where aggregates range in size from six to sixty monomers),\nwe quantitatively relate the shape of the structure factor to physical\ncharacteristics including intercluster distance and cluster size. We also test\ntwo previously postulated criteria for identifying the emergence of clustered\nphases that are based on IRO peak-height and -width, respectively. We find that\nthe criterion based on peak-width, which encodes the IRO thermal correlation\nlength, is more robust across a wide range of conditions and interaction\nstrengths but nonetheless approximate. Ultimately, we recommend a hybrid\nheuristic drawing on both pre-peak height and width for positively identifying\nthe emergence of clustered states.\n", "  Using computer simulations, we validate a simple free energy model that can\nbe analytically solved to predict the equilibrium size of self-limiting\nclusters of particles in the fluid state governed by a combination of\nshort-range attractive and long-range repulsive pair potentials. The model is a\nsemi-empirical adaptation and extension of the canonical free energy-based\nresult due to Groenewold and Kegel [J. Phys. Chem. B, 105 (2001)], where we use\nnew computer simulation data to systematically improve the cluster-size\nscalings with respect to the strengths of the competing interactions driving\naggregation. We find that one can adapt a classical nucleation like theory for\nsmall energetically-frustrated aggregates provided one appropriately accounts\nfor a size-dependent, microscopic energy penalty of interface formation, which\nrequires new scaling arguments. This framework is verified in part by\nconsidering the extensive scaling of intracluster bonding, where we uncover a\nsuperlinear scaling regime distinct from (and located between) the known\nregimes for small and large aggregates. We validate our model based on\ncomparisons against approximately 100 different simulated systems comprising\ncompact spherical aggregates with characteristic (terminal) sizes between six\nand sixty monomers, which correspond to wide ranges in\nexperimentally-controllable parameters.\n", "  Restricting the number of attractive physical \"bonds\" that can form between\nparticles in a fluid suppresses the usual demixing phase transition to very low\nparticle concentrations, allowing for the formation of open, percolated, and\nhomogeneous states, aptly called equilibrium or \"empty\" gels. Most\ndemonstrations of this concept have directly limited the microscopic particle\nvalence via anisotropic (patchy) attractions; however, an alternative\nmacroscopic valence limitation would be desirable for greater experimental\ntunability and responsiveness. One possibility, explored in this paper, is to\nemploy primary particles with attractions mediated via a secondary species of\nlinking particles. In such a system, the linker-to-primary particle ratio\nserves as a macroscopic control parameter for the average microscopic valence.\nWe show that the phase behavior of such a system predicted by Wertheim's first\norder perturbation theory is consistent with equilibrium gel formation: the\nprimary particle concentrations corresponding to the two-phase demixing\ntransition are significantly suppressed at both low and high linker-to-primary\nparticle ratios. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations validate these\ntheoretical predictions but also reveal the presence of loops of bonded\nparticles, which are neglected in the theory. Such loops cause densification\nand inhibit percolation, and hence the range of viable empty gel state\nconditions is somewhat reduced relative to the Wertheim theory predictions.\n", "  Complementary media (CM) interacting with arbitrarily situated obstacles are\nusually less discussed. In this paper, an analytical framework based on\nmultiple scattering theory is established for analyzing such a mismatched case.\nAs examples, CM-based devices, i.e., a superlens and superscatterer, are\ndiscussed. From an analysis, the cancellation mechanism of the mismatched CM is\nstudied. In addition, numerical results are provided for illustration.\nMoreover, further study shows that such cancellation effects might rely on\nspecific conditions. Actually, the conclusions are not restricted to any\nspecific frequencies; they could be extended to many other areas including\napplications to active cloaking, antennas, and wireless power transfer.\n", "  We study the $z\\approx3.5$ intergalactic medium (IGM) by comparing new,\nhigh-quality absorption spectra of eight QSOs with $\\langle z_{\\rm QSO}\n\\rangle=3.75$, to virtual observations of the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulations. We employ the pixel optical depth method and uncover strong\ncorrelations between various combinations of HI, CIII, CIV, SiIII, SiIV, and\nOVI. We find good agreement between many of the simulated and observed\ncorrelations, including OVI(HI). However, the observed median optical depths\nfor the CIV(HI) and SiIV(HI) relations are higher than those measured from the\nmock spectra. The discrepancy increases from up to $\\approx0.1$ dex at\n$\\tau_{\\rm HI}=1$ to $\\approx1$ dex at $\\tau_{\\rm HI}=10^2$, where we are\nlikely probing dense regions at small galactocentric distances. As possible\nsolutions, we invoke (a) models of ionizing radiation softened above 4 Ryd to\naccount for delayed completion of HeII reionization; (b) simulations run at a\nhigher resolution; (c) the inclusion of additional line broadening due to\nunresolved turbulence; and (d) increased elemental abundancess; however, none\nof these factors can fully explain the observed differences. Enhanced\nphotoionization of HI by local sources, which was not modelled, could offer a\nsolution. However, the much better agreement with the observed OVI(HI)\nrelation, which we find probes a hot and likely collisionally-ionized gas\nphase, indicates that the simulations are not in tension with the hot phase of\nthe IGM, and suggests that the simulated outflows may entrain insufficient cool\ngas.\n", "  We consider theoretically the effect of an inhomogeneous magnetoelectric\ncoupling on the magnon-induced dynamics of a ferromagnet. The magnon-mediated\nmagnetoelectric torque affects both the homogeneous magnetization and\nmagnon-driven domain wall motion. In the domains, we predict a reorientation of\nthe magnetization, controllable by the applied electric field, which is almost\nan order of magnitude larger than that observed in other physical systems via\nthe same mechanism. The applied electric field can also be used to tune the\ndomain wall speed and direction of motion in a linear fashion, producing domain\nwall velocities several times the zero field velocity. These results show that\nmultiferroic systems offer a promising arena to achieve low-dissipation\nmagnetization rotation and domain wall motion by exciting spin-waves.\n", "  We use new precision measurements of black hole masses from water megamaser\ndisks to investigate scaling relations between macroscopic galaxy properties\nand supermassive black hole (BH) mass. The megamaser-derived BH masses span\n10^6-10^8 M_sun, while all the galaxy properties that we examine (including\nstellar mass, central mass density, central velocity dispersion) lie within a\nnarrow range. Thus, no galaxy property correlates tightly with M_BH in ~L*\nspiral galaxies. Of them all, stellar velocity dispersion provides the tightest\nrelation, but at fixed sigma* the mean megamaser M_BH are offset by -0.6+/-0.1\ndex relative to early-type galaxies. Spiral galaxies with non-maser dynamical\nBH masses do not show this offset. At low mass, we do not yet know the full\ndistribution of BH mass at fixed galaxy property; the non-maser dynamical\nmeasurements may miss the low-mass end of the BH distribution due to inability\nto resolve the spheres of influence and/or megamasers may preferentially occur\nin lower-mass BHs.\n", "  The multistate Potts models on two-dimensional hyperbolic lattices are\nstudied with respect to various boundary effects. The free energy is\nnumerically calculated by Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group method.\nWe analyze phase transitions of the Potts models in the thermodynamic limit\nwith respect to contracted boundary layers. A false phase transition is present\neven if a couple of the boundary layers are contracted. Its significance\nweakens, as the number of the contracted boundary layers increases, until the\ncorrect phase transition (deep inside the bulk) prevails over the false one.\nFor this purpose we derive a thermodynamic quantity, the so-called bulk excess\nfree energy, which depends on the contracted boundary layers and memorizes\nadditional boundary effects. In particular, the magnetic field is imposed on\nthe outermost boundary layer. While the boundary magnetic field does not affect\nthe second-order phase transition in the bulk if suppressing all the boundary\neffects on the hyperbolic lattices, the first-order (discontinuous) phase\ntransition is significantly sensitive to the boundary magnetic field. Contrary\nto the phase transition on the Euclidean lattices, the discontinuous phase\ntransition on the hyperbolic lattices can be continuously controlled (within a\ncertain temperature coexistence region) by varying the boundary magnetic field.\n", "  We present a study of the excitation conditions and metallicity of ionized\ngas (Z_gas) in eight nearby barred and unbarred spiral galaxies from the\nVIRUS-P Exploration of Nearby Galaxies (VENGA) survey, which provides high\nspatial sampling and resolution (median ~ 387 pc), large coverage from the\nbulge to outer disc, broad wavelength range (3600-6800 Ang.), and medium\nspectral resolution (~ 120 km s^-1 at 5000 Ang.). Our results are: (1) We\npresent high resolution gas excitation maps to differentiate between regions\nwith excitation typical of Seyfert, LINER, or recent star formation. We find\nLINER-type excitation at large distances (3-10 kpc) from the centre, and\nassociate this excitation with diffuse ionized gas (DIG). (2) After excluding\nspaxels dominated by Seyfert, LINER, or DIG, we produce maps with the best\nspatial resolution and sampling to date of the ionization parameter q, star\nformation rate, and Z_gas using common strong line diagnostics. We find that\nisolated barred and unbarred spirals exhibit similarly shallow Z_gas profiles\nfrom the inner kpc out to large radii (7-10 kpc or 0.5-1.0 R_25). This implies\nthat if profiles had steeper gradients at earlier epochs, then the present-day\nbar is not the primary driver flattening gradients over time. This result\ncontradicts earlier claims, but agrees with recent IFU studies. (3) The Z_gas\ngradients in our z ~ 0 massive spirals are markedly shallower, by ~ 0.2 dex\nkpc^-1, than published gradients for lensed lower mass galaxies at z ~ 1.5-2.0.\nCosmologically-motivated hydrodynamical simulations best match this inferred\nevolution, but the match is sensitive to adopted stellar feedback\nprescriptions.\n", "  We report our study of the optical pumping effect in absorption imaging of\n$^{23}$Na atoms in the $F=1$ hyperfine spin states. Solving a set of rate\nequations for the spin populations in the presence of a probe beam, we obtain\nan analytic expression for the optical signal of the $F=1$ absorption imaging.\nFurthermore, we verify the result by measuring the absorption spectra of\n$^{23}$Na Bose-Einstein condensates prepared in various spin states with\ndifferent probe beam pulse durations. The analytic result can be used in the\nquantitative analysis of $F=1$ spinor condensate imaging and readily applied to\nother alkali atoms with $I=3/2$ nuclear spin such as $^{87}$Rb.\n", "  In this Letter we compare the abundance of member galaxies of a rich, nearby\n($z=0.09$) galaxy cluster, Abell 2142, with that of halos of comparable virial\nmass extracted from sets of state-of-the-art numerical simulations, both\ncollisionless at different resolutions and with the inclusion of baryonic\nphysics in the form of cooling, star formation, and feedback by active galactic\nnuclei. We also use two semi-analytical models to account for the presence of\norphan galaxies. The photometric and spectroscopic information, taken from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12 (SDSS DR12) database, allows us to\nestimate the stellar velocity dispersion of member galaxies of Abell 2142. This\nquantity is used as proxy for the total mass of secure cluster members and is\nproperly compared with that of subhalos in simulations. We find that simulated\nhalos have a statistically significant ($\\gtrsim 7$ sigma confidence level)\nsmaller amount of massive (circular velocity above $200\\,{\\rm km\\, s^{-1}}$)\nsubhalos, even before accounting for the possible incompleteness of\nobservations. These results corroborate the findings from a recent strong\nlensing study of the Hubble Frontier Fields galaxy cluster MACS J0416\n\\citep{grillo2015} and suggest that the observed difference is already present\nat the level of dark matter (DM) subhalos and is not solved by introducing\nbaryonic physics. A deeper understanding of this discrepancy between\nobservations and simulations will provide valuable insights into the impact of\nthe physical properties of DM particles and the effect of baryons on the\nformation and evolution of cosmological structures.\n", "  We derive an exact formulation of the multivariate integral representing the\nsingle-visit obscurational and photometric completeness joint probability\ndensity function for arbitrary distributions for planetary parameters. We\npresent a derivation of the region of nonzero values of this function which\nextends previous work, and discuss time and computational complexity costs and\nbenefits of the method. We present a working implementation, and demonstrate\nexcellent agreement between this approach and Monte Carlo simulation results\n", "  There is still much debate surrounding how the most massive, central galaxies\nin the local universe have assembled their stellar mass, especially the\nrelative roles of in-situ growth versus later accretion via mergers. In this\npaper, we set firmer constraints on the evolutionary pathways of the most\nmassive central galaxies by making use of empirical estimates on their\nabundances and stellar ages. The most recent abundance matching and direct\nmeasurements strongly favour that a substantial fraction of massive galaxies\nwith Mstar>3x10^11 Msun reside at the centre of clusters with mass\nMhalo>3x10^13 Msun. Spectral analysis supports ages >10 Gyrs, corresponding to\na formation redshift z_form >2. We combine these two pieces of\nobservationally-based evidence with the mass accretion history of their host\ndark matter haloes. We find that in these massive haloes, the stellar mass\nlocked up in the central galaxy is comparable to, if not greater than, the\ntotal baryonic mass at z_form. These findings indicate that either only a\nrelatively minor fraction of their present-day stellar mass was formed in-situ\nat z_form, or that these massive, central galaxies form in the extreme scenario\nwhere almost all of the baryons in the progenitor halo are converted into\nstars. Interestingly, the latter scenario would not allow for any substantial\nsize growth since the galaxy's formation epoch either via mergers or expansion.\nWe show our results hold irrespective of systematic uncertainties in stellar\nmass, abundances, galaxy merger rates, stellar initial mass function, star\nformation rate and dark matter accretion histories.\n", "  Nucleosomes form the basic unit of compaction within eukaryotic genomes and\ntheir locations represent an important, yet poorly understood, mechanism of\ngenetic regulation. Quantifying the strength of interactions within the\nnucleosome is a central problem in biophysics and is critical to understanding\nhow nucleosome positions influence gene expression. By comparing to\nsingle-molecule experiments, we demonstrate that a coarse-grained molecular\nmodel of the nucleosome can reproduce key aspects of nucleosome unwrapping.\nUsing detailed simulations of DNA and histone proteins, we calculate the\ntension-dependent free energy surface corresponding to the unwrapping process.\nThe model reproduces quantitatively the forces required to unwrap the\nnucleosome, and reveals the role played by electrostatic interactions during\nthis process. We then demonstrate that histone modifications and DNA sequence\ncan have significant effects on the energies of nucleosome formation. Most\nnotably, we show that histone tails are crucial for stabilizing the outer turn\nof nucleosomal DNA.\n", "  We study the phenomenological implications of the presence of two zeros in a\nmagic neutrino mass matrix. We find that only two such patterns of the neutrino\nmass matrix are experimentally acceptable. We express all the neutrino\nobservables as functions of one unknown phase $\\phi$ and two known parameters\n$\\Delta m^{2}_{12}$, $r=\\Delta m^{2}_{12}/\\Delta m^{2}_{23}$. In particular, we\nfind $\\sin^2 \\theta_{13}=(2/3)r/(1+r)$. We also present a mass model for the\nallowed textures based upon the group $A_{4}$ using type I+II see-saw\nmechanism.\n", "  The importance of the fourth and higher order terms in the Taylor series\nexpansion of the energy of the isospin asymmetric nuclear matter in the study\nof the neutron star crust-core phase transition is investigated using the\nfinite range simple effective interaction. Analytic expressions for the\nevaluation of the second and fourth order derivative terms in the Taylor series\nexpansion for any general finite range interaction of Yukawa, exponential or\nGaussian form have been obtained. The effect of the nuclear matter\nincompressibility, symmetry energy and slope parameters on the predictions for\nthe crust-core transition density is examined. The crustal moment of inertia is\ncalculated and the prediction for the radius of the Vela pulsar is analyzed\nusing different equations of state.\n", "  Weyl-orbit functions have been defined for each simple Lie algebra, and\npermit Fourier-like analysis on the fundamental region of the corresponding\naffine Weyl group. They have also been discretized, using a refinement of the\ncoweight lattice, so that digitized data on the fundamental region can be\nFourier-analyzed. The discretized orbit function has arguments that are\nredundant if related by the affine Weyl group, while its labels, the Weyl-orbit\nrepresentatives, invoke the dual affine Weyl group. Here we discretize the\norbit functions in a novel way, by using the weight lattice. A cleaner theory\nresults, with symmetry between the arguments and labels of the discretized\norbit functions. Orthogonality of the new discretized orbit functions is\nproved, and leads to the construction of unitary, symmetric matrices with\nWeyl-orbit-valued elements. For one type of orbit function, the matrix\ncoincides with the Kac-Peterson modular $S$ matrix, important for\nWess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten conformal field theory.\n", "  A micron-sized droplet of bromine water immersed in a surfactant-laden oil\nphase can swim (S. Thutupalli, R. Seemann, S. Herminghaus, New J. Phys. 13\n073021 (2011)). The bromine reacts with the surfactant at the droplet interface\nand generates a surfactant mixture. It can spontaneously phase-separate due to\nsolutocapillary Marangoni flow, which propels the droplet. We model the system\nby a diffusion-advection-reaction equation for the mixture order parameter at\nthe interface including thermal noise and couple it to fluid flow. Going beyond\nprevious work, we illustrate the coarsening dynamics of the surfactant mixture\ntowards phase separation in the axisymmetric swimming state. Coarsening\nproceeds in two steps: an initially slow growth of domain size followed by a\nnearly ballistic regime. On larger time scales thermal fluctuations in the\nlocal surfactant composition initiates random changes in the swimming direction\nand the droplet performs a persistent random walk, as observed in experiments.\nNumerical solutions show that the rotational correlation time scales with the\nsquare of the inverse noise strength. We confirm this scaling by a perturbation\ntheory for the fluctuations in the mixture order parameter and thereby identify\nthe active emulsion droplet as an active Brownian particle.\n", "  Network analysis is an important tool in understanding the behavior of\ncomplex systems of interacting entities. However, due to the limitations of\ndata gathering technologies, some interactions might be missing from the\nnetwork model. This is a ubiquitous problem in all domains that use network\nanalysis, from social networks to hyper-linked web networks to biological\nnetworks. Consequently, an important question in analyzing networks is to\nunderstand how increasing the noise level (i.e. percentage of missing edges)\naffects different network parameters.\n  In this paper we evaluate the effect of noise on community scoring and\ncentrality-based parameters with respect to two different aspects of network\nanalysis: (i) sensitivity, that is how the parameter value changes as edges are\nremoved and (ii) reliability in the context of message spreading, that is how\nthe time taken to broadcast a message changes as edges are removed.\n  Our experiments on synthetic and real-world networks and three different\nnoise models demonstrate that for both the aspects over all networks and all\nnoise models, permanence qualifies as the most effective metric. For the\nsensitivity experiments closeness centrality is a close second. For the message\nspreading experiments, closeness and betweenness centrality based initiator\nselection closely competes with permanence. This is because permanence has a\ndual characteristic where the cumulative permanence over all vertices is\nsensitive to noise but the ids of the top-rank vertices, which are used to find\nseeds during message spreading remain relatively stable under noise.\n", "  We study a non-autonomous, non-linear evolution equation on the space of\noperators on a complex Hilbert space. We specify assumptions that ensure the\nglobal existence of its solutions and allow us to derive its asymptotics at\ntemporal infinity. We demonstrate that these assumptions are optimal in a\nsuitable sense and more general than those used before. The evolution equation\nderives from the Brocket-Wegner flow that was proposed to diagonalize matrices\nand operators by a strongly continuous unitary flow. In fact, the solution of\nthe non-linear flow equation leads to a diagonalization of Hamiltonian\noperators in boson quantum field theory which are quadratic in the field.\n", "  We present subarcsecond resolution mid-infrared (MIR) images obtained with\n8-10 m-class ground-based telescopes of a complete volume-limited (DL<40 Mpc)\nsample of 24 Seyfert galaxies selected from the Swift/BAT nine month catalog.\nWe use those MIR images to study the nuclear and circumnuclear emission of the\ngalaxies. Using different methods to classify the MIR morphologies on scales of\n~400 pc, we find that the majority of the galaxies (75-83%) are extended or\npossibly extended and 17-25% are point-like. This extended emission is compact\nand it has low surface brightness compared with the nuclear emission, and it\nrepresents, on average, ~30% of the total MIR emission of the galaxies in the\nsample. We find that the galaxies whose circumnuclear MIR emission is dominated\nby star formation show more extended emission (650+-700 pc) than AGN-dominated\nsystems (300+-100 pc). In general, the galaxies with point-like MIR\nmorphologies are face-on or moderately inclined (b/a~0.4-1.0), and we do not\nfind significant differences between the morphologies of Sy1 and Sy2. We used\nthe nuclear and circumnuclear fluxes to investigate their correlation with\ndifferent AGN and SF activity indicators. We find that the nuclear MIR emission\n(the inner ~70 pc) is strongly correlated with the X-ray emission (the harder\nthe X-rays the better the correlation) and with the [O IV] lambda 25.89 micron\nemission line, indicating that it is AGN-dominated. We find the same results,\nalthough with more scatter, for the circumnuclear emission, which indicates\nthat the AGN dominates the MIR emission in the inner ~400 pc of the galaxies,\nwith some contribution from star formation.\n", "  We present systematic analysis of spatio-temporal evolution of sources of\nhard X-ray (HXR) pulsations in solar flares. We concentrate on disk flares\nwhose impulsive phase are accompanied by a series of more than three peaks\n(pulsations) of HXR emission detected in the RHESSI 50-100 keV channel with\n4-second cadence. 29 such flares observed from February 2002 to June 2015 with\ntime differences between successive peaks of 8-270 s are studied. The main\nobservational result is that sources of HXR pulsations in all flares are not\nstationary, they demonstrate apparent displacements from pulsation to\npulsation. The flares can be subdivided into two groups depending on character\nof dynamics of HXR sources. The group-1 consists of 16 flares (55%) with\nsystematic dynamics of HXR sources from pulsation to pulsation with respect to\na magnetic polarity inversion line (MPIL), which has simple extended trace on\nthe photosphere. The group-2 consists of 13 flares (45%) with more chaotic\ndisplacements of HXR sources with respect to an MPIL having more complicated\nstructure. Based on the observations we conclude that the mechanism of flare\nHXR pulsations is related to successive triggering of energy release in\ndifferent magnetic loops. Group-1 flare regions consist of loops stacked into\nmagnetic arcades extended along MPILs. Group-2 flare regions have more\ncomplicated magnetic structures and loops are arranged more chaotically. We\nalso found that at least 14 (88%) group-1 flares and 11 (85%) group-2 flares\nare accompanied by coronal mass ejections, i.e. the majority of flares studied\nare eruptive events. This gives an indication that eruptive processes play\nimportant role in generation of HXR pulsations. We suggest that an erupting\nflux rope can act as a trigger of energy release. Its successive interaction\nwith different loops can lead to apparent motion of HXR sources and to a series\nof HXR pulsations.\n", "  Malaria is one of the most common diseases caused by mosquitoes and is a\ngreat public health problem worldwide. Currently, for malaria diagnosis the\nstandard technique is microscopic examination of a stained blood film. We\npropose use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for the diagnosis of the\ndisease in the red blood cell. For this purpose features / parameters are\ncomputed from the data obtained by the digital holographic images of the blood\ncells and is given as input to ANN which classifies the cell as the infected\none or otherwise.\n", "  It is generally accepted that the hydrophilic property of graphene can be\naffected by the underlying substrate. However, the role of intrinsic vs.\nsubstrate contributions and the related mechanisms are vividly debated. Here we\nshow that the intrinsic hydrophilicity of graphene can be intimately connected\nto the position of its Fermi level, which affects the interaction between\ngraphene and water molecules. The underlying substrate, or dopants, can tune\nhydrophilicity by modulating the Fermi level of graphene. By shifting the Fermi\nlevel of graphene away from its Dirac point, via either chemical or electrical\nvoltage doping, we show enhanced hydrophilicity with experiments and first\nprinciple simulations. Increased vapor condensation on graphene, induced by a\nsimple shifting of its Fermi level, exemplifies applications in the area of\ninterfacial transport phenomena.\n", "  A sequence of the interface transition states was investigated. A transition\nstate has been found, during which cusps look like splashes. Images of the\nsplashes for different joints have been obtained. The processes of\nself-organization of the splashes into a quasi-wave surface and a perfect wavy\nsurface have been revealed. Simulations experiments have been conducted.\nHeterogeneity and the interface bending of one of the contacting materials have\nbeen detected. They imitate the heterogeneity on the interface arising upon\nexplosive welding.\n", "  This is a comment on the paper arXiv:1410.2840 by Ji and Jin, to appear in\nthe AOAS.\n", "  We study emerging phenomena in binary neural networks where, with a\nprobability c synaptic intensities are chosen according with a Hebbian\nprescription, and with probability (1-c) there is an extra random contribution\nto synaptic weights. This new term, randomly taken from a Gaussian bimodal\ndistribution, balances the synaptic population in the network so that one has\n80-20 relation in E/I population ratio, mimicking the balance observed in\nmammals cortex. For some regions of the relevant parameters, our system depicts\nstandard memory (at low temperature) and non-memory attractors (at high\ntemperature). However, as c decreases and the level of the underlying noise\nalso decreases below a certain temperature T_t, a kind of memory-frustrated\nstate, which resembles spin-glass behavior, sharply emerges. Contrary to what\noccurs in Hopfield-like neural networks, the frustrated state appears here even\nin the limit of the loading parameter alpha-->0. Moreover, we observed that the\nfrustrated state in fact corresponds to two states of non-vanishing activity\nuncorrelated with stored memories, associated, respectively, to a high activity\nor Up state and to a low activity or Down state. Using a linear stability\nanalysis, we found regions in the space of relevant parameters for locally\nstable steady states and demonstrated that frustrated states coexist with\nmemory attractors below T_t. Then, multistability between memory and frustrated\nstates is present for relatively small c, and metastability of memory\nattractors can emerge as c decreases even more. We studied our system using\nstandard mean-field techniques and with Monte Carlo simulations, obtaining a\nperfect agreement between theory and simulations. Our study can be useful to\n...\n", "  A systematic study is performed on the spinel oxide, i.e. LiTi2O4 thin films\noriented along [111]-, [110]-, and [001]-directions, to reveal the\ncrystallographic dependence of transport properties. With decreasing\ntemperature, the LiTi2O4 displays roughly identical onset temperatures of\ntwofold symmetry of in-plane angular dependent magnetoresistivity (AMR) (at ~\n100 K), crossover from negative- to positive- magnetoresistance (at ~ 50 K),\nand coherence length in the superconducting state. While, the twofold symmetry\nin AMR itself suggests anisotropic electron scattering. The superconducting\ntransition temperature (Tc) seems insensitive to the lattice parameter.\nMoreover, the spherical aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron\nmicroscopy (Cs-STEM) discloses that oxygen vacancies exist in the LiTi2O4\nfilms. These oxygen vacancies cause the change of lattice but show little\ninfluence on superconductivity, differing from high-Tc cuprates where subtle\nvariation of oxygen way lead to a significant change in superconductivity.\n", "  The coexistence and competition of superconductivity and magnetism can lead\nto a variety of rich physics and technological applications. Recent discovery\nof atomic-layer superconductors and self-assembly of magnetic molecules on\nsolid surfaces should allow one to create a new two-dimensional (2D) hybrid\nsuperconducting system, but its possibility has never been fully investigated\nso far. Here we report the fabrication of highly ordered 2D hybrid\nsuperconductors based on indium atomic layers on silicon surfaces and magnetic\nmetal-phthalocyanines (MPc) and clarify their detailed structural,\nsuperconducting and magnetic properties. Our primary findings include a\nsubstantial controllability of the superconducting transition temperatures (Tc)\nthrough substitution of central metal ions (M = Cu, Fe, Mn) of the molecules.\nThis is attributed to charge transfers between the magnetic molecules and the\nsuperconducting layers and to different degrees of exchange coupling between\nthem, which originates from anisotropic distributions of the relevant\nd-orbitals. The present study opens a route for designing and creating exotic\n2D superconductors with an atomic-scale precision.\n", "  We investigate physics opportunities to constraint leptonic CP-violation\nphase $\\delta_{CP}$ through numerical analysis of working neutrino oscillation\nprobability parameters, in the context of long base line experiments. Numerical\nanalysis of two parameters, the \" transition probability $\\delta_{CP}$ phase\nsensitivity parameter ($A^M$) \" and \" CP-violation probability $\\delta_{CP}$\nphase sensitivity parameter ($A^{CP}$) \", as function of beam energy and/or\nbase line has been preferably carried out. It is an elegant technique to\nbroadly analyze different experiments to constraint $\\delta_{CP}$ phase and\nalso to investigate mass hierarchy in the leptonic sector. The positive and\nnegative values of parameter $A^{CP}$ corresponding to either of hierarchy in\nthe specific beam energy ranges, could be a very promising way to explore mass\nhierarchy and $\\delta_{CP}$ phase. The keys to more robust bounds on\n$\\delta_{CP}$ phase are improvements of the involved detection techniques to\nexplore bit low energy and relatively long base line regions with better\nexperimental accuracy.\n", "  The main aim of this work is to estimate possible radio GHz emission of\nextrasolar planets and brown dwarfs and to check if such radiation can be\ndetected by Very Large Baseline Interferometers (VLBI). In the estimation we\nassume that the emission may originate in processes similar to those observed\nin the Jupiter system. The frequency of the radio emission that is produced in\nthis system depends mostly on the magnetic field strength. Jupiter's magnetic\nfield ($\\sim 9$ G on average) allows for radiation from kHz frequencies up to\n40 MHz. This is well below the frequency range of VLBI. However, it was\ndemonstrated that the magnetic field strength in massive and young object may\nbe up to two orders of magnitude higher than for Jupiter, which is especially\nrelevant for planets around short-lived A type stars. This should extend the\nrange of the emission up to GHz frequencies. We calculated expected flux\ndensities of radio emission for a variety of hypothetical young planetary\nsystems. We analysed two different emission scenarios, and found that the\nradiation induced by moons (process similar to Jupiter-Io interactions) appears\nto be less efficient than the emission generated by a stellar wind on a\nplanetary magnetosphere. We also estimated hypothetical emission of planets and\nbrown dwarfs located around relatively young and massive main sequence A-type\nstars. Our results show that the emission produced by stellar winds could be\ndetected by currently operating VLBI networks.\n", "  We use measurements from the Rosetta plasma consortium (RPC) Langmuir probe\n(LAP) and mutual impedance probe (MIP) to study the spatial distribution of\nlow-energy plasma in the near-nucleus coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.\nThe spatial distribution is highly structured with the highest density in the\nsummer hemisphere and above the region connecting the two main lobes of the\ncomet, i.e. the neck region. There is a clear correlation with the neutral\ndensity and the plasma to neutral density ratio is found to be about 1-2x10^-6,\nat a cometocentric distance of 10 km and at 3.1 AU from the sun. A clear 6.2 h\nmodulation of the plasma is seen as the neck is exposed twice per rotation. The\nelectron density of the collisonless plasma within 260 km from the nucleus\nfalls of with radial distance as about 1/r. The spatial structure indicates\nthat local ionization of neutral gas is the dominant source of low-energy\nplasma around the comet.\n", "  The upgrade of the VLTI infrastructure for the 2nd generation instruments is\nnow complete with the transformation of the laboratory, and installation of\nstar separators on both the 1.8-m Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs) and the 8-m Unit\nTelescopes (UTs). The Gravity fringe tracker has had a full semester of\ncommissioning on the ATs, and a first look at the UTs. The CIAO infrared\nwavefront sensor is about to demonstrate its performance relative to the\nvisible wavefront sensor MACAO. First astrometric measurements on the ATs and\nastrometric qualification of the UTs are on-going. Now is a good time to\nrevisit the performance roadmap for VLTI that was initiated in 2014, which\naimed at coherently driving the developments of the interferometer, and\nespecially its performance, in support to the new generation of instruments:\nGravity and MATISSE.\n", "  The concept of reduced variables is revisited with regard to van der Waals'\ntheory and an application is made to polytropic spheres, where the reduced\nradial coordinate is ${\\rm red}(r)=r/R=\\xi/\\Xi$, $R$ radius, and the reduced\ndensity is ${\\rm red}(\\rho)=\\rho/\\lambda=\\theta^n$, $\\lambda$ central density.\nReduced density profiles are plotted for several polytropic indexes within the\nrange, $0\\le n\\le5$, disclosing two noticeable features. First, any point of\ncoordinates, $({\\rm red}(r),{\\rm red}(\\rho))$, $0\\le{\\rm red}(r)\\le1$,\n$0\\le{\\rm red}(\\rho)\\le1$, belongs to a reduced density profile of the kind\nconsidered. Second, sufficiently steep i.e. large $n$ reduced density profiles\nexhibit an oblique inflection point, where the threshold is found to be located\nat $n=n_{\\rm th}=0.888715$. Reduced pressure profiles, ${\\rm\nred}(P)=P/\\varpi=\\theta^{n+1}$, $\\varpi$ central pressure, Lane-Emden\nfucntions, $\\theta=(\\rho/\\lambda)^{1/n}$, and polytropic curves, ${\\rm\nred}(P)={\\rm red}(P)({\\rm red}(\\rho))$, are also plotted. The method can be\nextended to nonspherical polytropes with regard to a selected direction, ${\\rm\nred}(r)(\\mu)=r(\\mu)/R(\\mu)=\\xi(\\mu)/\\Xi(\\mu)$. The results can be extended to\npolytropic spheres made of collisionless particles, for polytropic index within\na more restricted range, $1/2\\le n\\le5$.\n", "  ESA and NASA maintain asteroid hazard lists that contain all known asteroids\nwith a non zero chance of colliding with the Earth in the future. Some software\ntools exist that are, either, capable of calculating the impact points of those\nasteroids, or that can estimate the impact effects of a given impact incident.\nHowever, no single tool is available that combines both aspects and enables a\ncomprehensive risk analysis. The question is, thus, whether tools that can\ncalculate impact location may be used to obtain a qualitative understanding of\nthe asteroid impact risk distribution. To answer this question, two impact risk\ndistributions that control for impact effect modelling were generated and\ncompared. The Asteroid Risk Mitigation Optimization and Research (ARMOR) tool,\nin conjunction with the freely available software OrbFit, was used to project\nthe impact probabilities of listed asteroids with a minimum diameter of 30 m\nonto the surface of the Earth representing a random sample (15% of all objects)\nof the hazard list. The resulting 261 impact corridors were visualized on a\nglobal map. Furthermore, the impact corridors were combined with Earth\npopulation data to estimate the simplified risk (without impact effects) and\nadvanced risk (with impact effects) associated with the direct asteroid impacts\nthat each nation faces from present to 2100 based on this sample. The\nrelationship between risk and population size was examined for the 40 most\npopulous countries and it was apparent that population size is a good proxy for\nrelative risk. The advanced and simplified risk distributions were compared and\nthe alteration of the results based on the introduction of physical impact\neffects was discussed. Population remained a valid proxy for relative impact\nrisk, but the inclusion of impact effects resulted in significantly different\nrisks, especially when considered at the national level.\n", "  The limits to the angular resolution achievable with conventional\nground-based telescopes are unchanged over 70 years. Atmospheric turbulence\nlimits image quality to typically ~1 arcsec in practice. We have developed a\nnew concept of ground-based imaging instrument called GravityCam capable of\ndelivering significantly sharper images from the ground than is normally\npossible without adaptive optics. The acquisition of visible images at high\nspeed without significant noise penalty has been made possible by advances in\noptical and near IR imaging technologies. Images are recorded at high speed and\nthen aligned before combination and can yield a 3-5 fold improvement in image\nresolution. Very wide survey fields are possible with widefield telescope\noptics. We describe GravityCam and detail its application to accelerate greatly\nthe rate of detection of Earth size planets by gravitational microlensing.\nGravityCam will also improve substantially the quality of weak shear studies of\ndark matter distribution in distant clusters of galaxies. The microlensing\nsurvey will also provide a vast dataset for asteroseismology studies. In\naddition, GravityCam promises to generate a unique data set that will help us\nunderstand of the population of the Kuiper belt and possibly the Oort cloud.\n", "  We present SPIKE (Spectrometry Processing Innovative KErnel), an open-source\nPython package dedicated to Fourier spectroscopies. It provides basic\nfunctionalities such as apodisation, a complete set of Fourier transforms,\nphasing for NMR), peak-picking, baseline correction and also tools such as\nLinear Prediction. Beside its versatility, the most prominent novelty of this\npackage is to incorporate new tools for Big Data processing. This is\nexemplified by its ability to handle the processing and visualization of very\nlarge data-sets, with multiprocessor capabilities and a low memory footprint.\nThe software contains also all the tools necessary for the specific fast\nprocessing and visualization of 2D-FTICR-MS data-sets.\n", "  We propose a series of simulations about the potential use of Boron isotopes\nto trigger neutron-free (aneutronic) nuclear reactions in cancer cells through\nthe interaction with an incoming energetic proton beam, thus resulting in the\nemission of characteristic prompt gamma radiation (429 keV, 718 keV and 1435\nkeV). Furthermore assuming that the Boron isotopes are absorbed in cancer\ncells, the three alpha-particles produced in each p-11B aneutronic nuclear\nfusion reactions can potentially result in the enhancement of the biological\ndose absorbed in the tumor region since these multi-MeV alpha-particles are\nstopped inside the single cancer cell, thus allowing to spare the surrounding\ntissues. Although a similar approach based on the use of 11B nuclei has been\nproposed in [1], our work demonstrate, using Monte Carlo simulations, the\ncrucial importance of the use of 10B nuclei (in a solution containing also 11B)\nfor the generation of prompt gamma-rays, which can be applied to medical\nimaging. In fact, we demonstrate that the use of 10B nuclei can enhance the\nintensity of the 718 keV gamma-ray peak more than 30 times compared to the\nsolution containing only 11B nuclei. A detailed explanation of the origin of\nthe different prompt gamma-rays, as well as of their application as real-time\ndiagnostics during a potential cancer treatment, is here discussed.\n", "  Described is a device acting on an acoustically levitated object by\nmanipulating the pressure and flow of a thin layer of air such that its\nrotation can be precisely controlled without mechanical contact. Virtual work\nanalysis assists in simplifying the multi-actuator control problem into a\nproblem governed by a controllable parameter. Actuation is done with a\nvibrating ring capable of producing ultrasonic standing and traveling waves,\ncreating the acoustic excitation that affects the pressure in a thin,\nintermediate layer of gas. A distinctive vibration pattern is required to\ngenerate the temporal and spatial pressure field of the squeezed air layer that\ngives rise to both acoustic levitation force and rotational torque. Described\nare the physical and design development stages leading to an optimized\nstructure, all followed by verifying and dynamics-calibration experiments.\nMoreover, by precisely controlling the ratio of standing and traveling waves in\na closed-loop, one can affect the shear forces applied by the squeezed air\nlayer, thus creating a non-contacting manipulation mechanism. An over-actuated\nset-up is converted via an algebraic transformation, into a simplified single\ncontrol-parameter problem. The transformation ties the standing waves ratio,\nand hence the rotational torque, to the amplitudes and phases of the actuators.\nThis arrangement leads to an effective closed loop methodology that was\nimplemented experimentally showing good performance and exhibiting rapid\nangular positioning.\n", "  The degree of depolarization of neutral particles in crystals can reach tens\nof percents over the crystal length of several centimeters, which can be the\nbasis for possible experimental application of the depolarization effect for\nmeasuring anomalous magnetic moments of short-lived neutral hyperons.\n", "  Data continuity for the Landsat program relies on accurate cross-calibration\namong sensors. The Landsat 8 OLI has been shown to exhibit superior performance\nto the sensors on Landsats 4-7 with respect to radiometric calibration, signal\nto noise, and geolocation. However, improvements to the positioning of the\nspectral response functions on the OLI have resulted in known biases for\ncommonly used spectral indices because the new band responses integrate\nabsorption features differently from previous Landsat sensors. The objective of\nthis analysis is to quantify the impact of these changes on linear spectral\nmixture models that use imagery collected by different Landsat sensors. The\n2013 underflight of Landsat 7 and 8 provides an opportunity to cross calibrate\nthe spectral mixing spaces of the ETM+ and OLI sensors using near-simultaneous\nacquisitions from a wide variety of land cover types worldwide. We use\n80,910,343 pairs of OLI and ETM+ spectra to characterize the OLI spectral\nmixing space and perform a cross-calibration with ETM+. This new global\ncollection of Landsat spectra spans a greater spectral diversity than those\nused in prior studies and the resulting Substrate, Vegetation, and Dark (SVD)\nspectral endmembers (EMs) supplant prior global Landsat EMs. We find only minor\n(-0.01 < u < 0.01) differences between SVD fractions unmixed using\nsensor-specific EMs. RMS misfit fractions are also small (<98% of pixels with\n<5% RMSE), in accord with past studies. Finally, vegetation is used as an\nexample to illustrate the empirical and theoretical relationship between\ncommonly used spectral indices and subpixel fractions. SVD fractions unmixed\nusing global EMs thus provide easily computable, linearly scalable, physically\nbased measures of subpixel land cover which can be compared accurately across\nthe entire Landsat 4-8 archive without introducing any additional cross-sensor\ncorrections.\n", "  The SAFARI Detector Test Facility is an ultra-low background optical testbed\nfor characterizing ultra-sensitive prototype horn-coupled TES bolmeters for\nSAFARI, the grating spectrometer on board the proposed SPICA satellite. The\ntestbed contains internal cold and hot black-body illuminators and a light-pipe\nfor illumination with an external source. We have added reimaging optics to\nfacilitate array optical measurements. The system is now being used for optical\ntesting of prototype detector arrays read out with frequency-domain\nmultiplexing. We present our latest optical measurements of prototype arrays\nand discuss these in terms of the instrument performance.\n", "  We report on the mechanical properties of few-layer black phosphorus (BP)\nnanosheets, in high vacuum and as a function of time of exposure to atmospheric\nconditions [1]. BP flakes with thicknesses ranging from 4 to 30 nm suspended\nover circular holes are characterized by nanoindentations using an atomic force\nmicroscope tip. From measurements in high vacuum an elastic modulus of 46+/-10\nGPa and breaking strength of 2.4+/-1 GPa are estimated. Both magnitudes are\nindependent of the thickness of the flakes. Our results show that the exposure\nto air has substantial influence in the mechanical response of flakes thinner\nthan 6 nm but small effects on thicker flakes.\n", "  Using mechanical exfoliation combined with a controlled double step transfer\nprocedure we demonstrate that single layers of antimony can be readily\nproduced. These flakes are not significantly contaminated upon exposure to\nambient conditions and they do not react with water. DFT calculations confirm\nour experimental observations and predict a band gap of 1.2-1.3 eV (ambient\nconditions) for single layer antimonene, which is smaller than that calculated\nunder vacuum conditions at 0 K. Our work confirms antimonene as a highly stable\n2D material with promising relevant applications in optoelectronics.\n", "  We describe a fast, stable algorithm for the solution of the inverse acoustic\nscattering problem in two dimensions. Given full aperture far field\nmeasurements of the scattered field for multiple angles of incidence, we use\nChen's method of recursive linearization to reconstruct an unknown sound speed\nat resolutions of thousands of square wavelengths in a fully nonlinear regime.\nDespite the fact that the underlying optimization problem is formally ill-posed\nand non-convex, recursive linearization requires only the solution of a\nsequence of linear least squares problems at successively higher frequencies.\nBy seeking a suitably band-limited approximation of the sound speed profile,\neach least squares calculation is well-conditioned and involves the solution of\na large number of forward scattering problems, for which we employ a recently\ndeveloped, spectrally accurate, fast direct solver. For the largest problems\nconsidered, involving 19,600 unknowns, approximately one million partial\ndifferential equations were solved, requiring approximately two days to compute\nusing a parallel MATLAB implementation on a multi-core workstation.\n", "  The concept of infinity took centuries to achieve recognized status in the\nfield of mathematics, despite the fact that it was implicitly present in nearly\nall mathematical endeavors. Here I explore the idea that a similar development\nmight be warranted in physics. Several threads will be speculatively examined,\nincluding some involving nonstandard analysis. While there are intriguing\npossibilities, there also are noteworthy difficulties.\n", "  In a recent publication (D. Bolmatov et al. Sci.Rep. 5, 15850 (2015)) the\nexperimental observation of structural transformations on crossing the Frenkel\nline in supercritical argon is claimed. Here we show that no experimental\nevidence of the structural transformation was presented. The reported\nexperimental observations which Bolmatov et al. claim as evidence of a\ntransition across the Frenkel line are instead due to the irregularity of the\nexperimental (P,T) path in their work.\n", "  Every isometry s of a positive-definite even lattice Q can be lifted to an\nautomorphism of the lattice vertex algebra V_Q. An important problem in vertex\nalgebra theory and conformal field theory is to classify the representations of\nthe s-invariant subalgebra V_Q^s of V_Q, known as an orbifold. In the case when\ns is an isometry of Q of order two, we have classified the irreducible modules\nof the orbifold vertex algebra V_Q^s and identified them as submodules of\ntwisted or untwisted V_Q-modules in [Bavalov-Elsinger]. Here we calculate their\nquantum dimensions and fusion products. The examples where Q is the orthogonal\ndirect sum of two copies of the A_2 root lattice and s is the 2-cycle\npermutation as well as where Q is the A_n root latice and s is a Dynkin diagram\nautomorphism are presented in detail.\n", "  In this paper, the Discontinuous Cell Method (DCM) is formulated with the\nobjective of simulating cohesive fracture propagation and fragmentation in\nhomogeneous solids without issues relevant to excessive mesh deformation\ntypical of available Finite Element formulations. DCM discretizes solids by\nusing the Delaunay triangulation and its associated Voronoi tessellation giving\nrise to a system of discrete cells interacting through shared facets. For each\nVoronoi cell, the displacement field is approximated on the basis of rigid body\nkinematics, which is used to compute a strain vector at the centroid of the\nVoronoi facets. Such strain vector is demonstrated to be the projection of the\nstrain tensor at that location. At the same point stress tractions are computed\nthrough vectorial constitutive equations derived on the basis of classical\ncontinuum tensorial theories. Results of analysis of a cantilever beam are used\nto perform convergence studies and comparison with classical finite element\nformulations in the elastic regime. Furthermore, cohesive fracture and\nfragmentation of homogeneous solids are studied under quasi-static and dynamic\nloading conditions. The mesh dependency problem, typically encountered upon\nadopting softening constitutive equations, is tackled through the crack band\napproach. This study demonstrates the capabilities of DCM by solving multiple\nbenchmark problems relevant to cohesive crack propagation. The simulations show\nthat DCM can handle effectively a wide range of problems from the simulation of\na single propagating fracture to crack branching and fragmentation.\n", "  We present a new implicit higher-order finite element (FE) approach to\nefficiently model compressible multicomponent fluid flow on unstructured grids\nand in fractured porous subsurface formations. The scheme is sequential\nimplicit: pressures and fluxes are updated with an implicit Mixed Hybrid Finite\nElement (MHFE) method, and the transport of each species is approximated with\nan implicit second-order Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) FE method. Discrete\nfractures are incorporated with a cross-flow equilibrium approach. This is the\nfirst investigation of all-implicit higher-order MHFE-DG for unstructured\ntriangular, quadrilateral (2D), and hexahedral (3D) grids and discrete\nfractures. A lowest-order implicit finite volume (FV) transport update is also\ndeveloped for the same grid types. The implicit methods are compared to an\nImplicit-Pressure-Explicit-Composition (IMPEC) scheme. For fractured domains,\nthe unconditionally stable implicit transport update is shown to increase\ncomputational efficiency by orders of magnitude as compared to IMPEC, which has\na time-step constraint proportional to the pore volume of discrete fracture\ngrid cells. However, when lowest-order Euler time-discretizations are used,\nnumerical errors increase linearly with the larger implicit time-steps,\nresulting in high numerical dispersion. Second-order Crank-Nicolson implicit\nMHFE-DG and MHFE-FV are therefore presented as well. Convergence analyses show\ntwice the convergence rate for the DG methods as compared to FV, resulting in\ntwo to three orders of magnitude higher computational efficiency. Numerical\nexperiments demonstrate the efficiency and robustness in modeling compressible\nmulticomponent flow on irregular and fractured 2D and 3D grids, even in the\npresence of fingering instabilities.\n", "  Recent experimental studies have shown that confinement can profoundly affect\nself-organization in semi-dilute active suspensions, leading to striking\nfeatures such as the formation of steady and spontaneous vortices in circular\ndomains and the emergence of unidirectional pumping motions in periodic\nracetrack geometries. Motivated by these findings, we analyze the\ntwo-dimensional dynamics in confined suspensions of active self-propelled\nswimmers using a mean-field kinetic theory where conservation equations for the\nparticle configurations are coupled to the forced Navier-Stokes equations for\nthe self-generated fluid flow. In circular domains, a systematic exploration of\nthe parameter space casts light on three distinct states: equilibrium with no\nflow, stable vortex, and chaotic motion, and the transitions between these are\nexplained and predicted quantitatively using a linearized theory. In periodic\nracetracks, similar transitions from equilibrium to net pumping to traveling\nwaves to chaos are observed in agreement with experimental observations and are\nalso explained theoretically. Our results underscore the subtle effects of\ngeometry on the morphology and dynamics of emerging patterns in active\nsuspensions and pave the way for the control of active collective motion in\nmicrofluidic devices.\n", "  From quantum mechanical first principles only, we rigorously study the\ntime-evolution of a $N$-level atom (impurity) interacting with an external\nmonochromatic light source within an infinite system of free electrons at\nthermal equilibrium (reservoir). In particular, we establish the relation\nbetween the full dynamics of the compound system and the effective dynamics for\nthe $N$-level atom, which is studied in detail in [Bru-de Siqueira\nPedra-Westrich, Annales Henri Poincar\\'e, 13(6):1305-1370, 2012]. Together with\n[Bru-de Siqueira Pedra-Westrich, Annales Henri Poincar\\'e, 13(6):1305-1370,\n2012] the present paper yields a purely microscopic theory of optical pumping\nin laser physics. The model we consider is general enough to describe gauge\ninvariant atom-reservoir interactions.\n", "  A bacterial photosynthetic light harvesting complex PLHC absorbs a photon and\ntransfers this energy almost perfectly at room temperature RT to a Reaction\nCenter RC, where charge separation occurs. While there are a number of possible\nlight absorbers involved in this process, our focus is the B850 and B875\ncomplexes. We propose that the dominant feature of the ground states in the\nB850 ring and the B875 open chain are pseudo one dimensional metals due to each\nbacteriochlorophyll a BChl containing a coordinated magnesium ion Mg2+. The Mg\nion structure undergoes a static Peierls distortion that results in symmetry\nbreaking that changes the even spacing of the Mg/BChl molecules comprising the\nchains to the experimentally observed Mg/BChl dimers. The results are charge\ndensity waves CDW, one for each type of the two complexes that result in an\nenergy gap in the single particle electronic spectrum and coherent phonon s\nspanning the entire rings. The ground state CDWs seem to have two functions the\nfirst is to form a stable optical platform and the second is to suppress\nradical formation and energy dissipation of the coherent excited state by\ncreating single particle energy gaps. After excitation by a photon, the B850\nexciton delocalizes on the ring a second photon can form a two-level exciton\npolariton that could be an alternative explanation for the splitting of the\nB850 exciton band. The coherent polariton formed could actively participate in\nuphill electronic energy transfer EET. Additionally we suggest other possible\nenergy storage mechanisms and entanglement possibilities. We suggest\nexperimental studies to clarify these proposals.\n", "  Life presents fascinating examples of self-organization and emergent\nphenomena. In multi-cellular organisms, a multitude of cells interact to form\nand maintain highly complex body plans of well-defined size. In this thesis, we\ninvestigate theoretical feedback mechanisms for both self-organized body plan\npatterning and size control.\n  The thesis is inspired by the astonishing scaling and regeneration abilities\nof flatworms. These worms can perfectly regrow their entire body plan even from\ntiny amputation fragments like the tip of the tail. Moreover, they can grow and\nactively de-grow by more than a factor of 40 in length depending on feeding\nconditions. These capabilities prompt for remarkable physical mechanisms of\nself-organized pattern formation and scaling.\n  First, we explore the basic principles and challenges of pattern scaling in\nmechanisms previously proposed to describe biological pattern formation. Next,\nwe present a novel class of patterning mechanisms yielding entirely\nself-organized and self-scaling patterns. This framework captures essential\nfeatures of body plan regeneration and scaling in flatworms. Further, we\nanalyze shape and motility of flatworms. By applying principal component\nanalysis, we characterize shape dynamics during different motility modes and\nalso identify shape variations between different flatworm species. Finally, we\ninvestigate the metabolic control of cell turnover and growth. We identify\nthree mechanisms of metabolic energy storage; theoretical descriptions thereof\ncan explain the measured organism growth by rules on the cellular scale.\n  In a close collaboration with experimental biologists, we combine minimal\ntheoretical descriptions with state-of-the-art experiments and data analysis.\nThis allows us to identify generic principles of scalable body plan patterning\nand growth control in flatworms.\n", "  A search is presented for CPT-violating effects in the mixing of $B^0_s$\nmesons using the D0 detector at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The\nCPT-violating asymmetry in the decay $B^0_s \\rightarrow \\mu^{\\pm} D_s^{\\mp} X$\nas a function of sidereal phase is measured. No evidence for CPT-violating\neffects is observed and limits are placed on CPT- and Lorentz-invariance\nviolating coupling coefficients.\n", "  We study the accretion of cold and hot dark matter onto a cosmic string wake\nusing a high-resolution numerical simulation. We verify previous analytical\ncalculations predicting the radius of bound matter around wakes and inflow\nvelocities of the dark matter, as well as assumptions about the self-similarity\nof the solution. In cold wakes, we show that self-similarity is approached\nquickly after a `binding' transition. Hot wakes approach self-similarity\nrapidly once the free streaming `pressure' falls below a critical value and\naccretion begins. We also analytically calculate the size of the overdensity in\nwakes with cold dark matter and compare the results to simulations. We remark\nthat the results derived may be used in testing gravitational numerical codes\nin the non-linear regime.\n", "  We study the large scale power spectrum of gravitational wave perturbations\nof the microwave background in the context of single-bubble open inflation\nmodels. We compute the ratio of tensor to scalar contributions to the CMB\nanisotropies as a function of $\\Omega_0$, the spectral index $n_S$ and the\ntunneling parameter $2\\pi GS_1/H$. We find that gravitational wave anisotropies\ncan be very large at small values of this tunneling parameter. We also consider\nthe contribution of supercurvature and bubble wall modes and find constraints\non the parameters of open inflation models from the observed temperature\nanisotropies of the CMB. We show that the induced gravity and open hybrid\nscenarios are compatible with present observations for a reasonable range of\nparameters.\n", "  Cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies probe the primordial density\nfield at the edge of the observable Universe. There is a limiting precision\n(``cosmic variance'') with which anisotropies can determine the amplitude of\nprimordial mass fluctuations. This arises because the surface of last scatter\n(SLS) probes only a finite two-dimensional slice of the Universe. Probing other\nSLSs observed from different locations in the Universe would reduce the cosmic\nvariance. In particular, the polarization of CMB photons scattered by the\nelectron gas in a cluster of galaxies provides a measurement of the CMB\nquadrupole moment seen by the cluster. Therefore, CMB polarization measurements\ntoward many clusters would probe the anisotropy on a variety of SLSs within the\nobservable Universe, and hence reduce the cosmic-variance uncertainty.\n", "  If a first-order phase transition is terminated by collisions of new-phase\nbubbles, there will exist a period of nonequilibrium between the time bubbles\ncollide and the time thermal equilibrium is established. We study the behavior\nof the order parameter during this phase. We find that large nonthermal\nfluctuations at this stage tend to restore symmetry, i.e., the order parameter\nis smaller than its eventual thermal equilibrium value. We comment on possible\nconsequences for electroweak baryogenesis.\n", "  We solve the coupled Boltzmann equation for the system of light photinos\ninteracting with pions and $R^0$'s (the gluon-gluino bound state) to determine\nthe relic abundance of light photinos in the light gaugino scenario. Cosmology\nbounds the ratio r of the R^0 mass to the photino mass to be less than about\n1.8. We also use a model Lagrangian embodying crossing symmetry between the\n$R^0 \\leftrightarrow \\photino \\pi \\pi$ and $R^0 \\pi \\leftrightarrow \\photino\n\\pi$ reactions to identify cosmologically favored regions of $R^0$ lifetime as\na function of $R^0$ and photino masses.\n", "  Topological defects can naturally be formed soon after bubble nucleation in\nthe open inflation scenario. The defects are not completely diluted away by the\nsubsequent period of inflation in the bubble interior and can produce\nobservable large-scale microwave background anisotropies. Superheavy strings\nand monopoles attached to the strings can act as gravitational lenses with\nangular separation between the images of up to an arc minute.\n", "  If the Universe consists of domains of matter and antimatter, annihilations\nat domain interfaces leave a distinctive imprint on the Cosmic Background\nRadiation (CBR) sky. The signature is anisotropies in the form of long, thin\nribbons of width $\\theta_W\\sim 0.1^\\circ$, separated by angle $\\theta_L\\simeq\n1^\\circ(L/100h^{-1}{Mpc})$ where L is the characteristic domain size, and\ny-distortion parameter $y \\approx 10^{-6}$. Such a pattern could potentially be\ndetected by the high-resolution CBR anisotropy experiments planned for the next\ndecade, and such experiments may finally settle the question of whether or not\nour Hubble volume is baryon symmetric.\n", "  We re-examine the constraints on the density perturbation spectrum, including\nits spectral index $n$, from the production of primordial black holes. The\nstandard cosmology, where the Universe is radiation dominated from the end of\ninflation up until the recent past, was studied by Carr, Gilbert and Lidsey; we\ncorrect two errors in their derivation and find a significantly stronger\nconstraint than they did, $n \\lesssim 1.25$ rather than their 1.5. We then\nconsider an alternative cosmology in which a second period of inflation, known\nas thermal inflation and designed to solve additional relic over-density\nproblems, occurs at a lower energy scale than the main inflationary period. In\nthat case, the constraint weakens to $n \\lesssim 1.3$, and thermal inflation\nalso leads to a `missing mass' range, $10^{18} g \\lesssim M \\lesssim 10^{26}\ng$, in which primordial black holes cannot form. Finally, we discuss the effect\nof allowing for the expected non-gaussianity in the density perturbations\npredicted by Bullock and Primack, which can weaken the constraints further by\nup to 0.05.\n", "  Moduli fields, a natural prediction of any supergravity and\nsuperstring-inspired supersymmetry theory, may lead to a prolonged period of\nmatter domination in the early Universe. This can be observationally viable\nprovided the moduli decay early enough to avoid harming nucleosynthesis. If\nprimordial black holes form, they would be expected to do so before or during\nthis matter dominated era. We examine the extent to which the standard\nprimordial black hole constraints are weakened in such a cosmology. Permitted\nmass fractions of black holes at formation are of order $10^{-8}$, rather than\nthe usual $10^{-20}$ or so. If the black holes form from density perturbations\nwith a power-law spectrum, its spectral index is limited to $n \\lesssim 1.3$,\nrather than the $n \\lesssim 1.25$ obtained in the standard cosmology.\n", "  Inflation predicts specific relations between the amplitudes and spectral\nindices of the primordial spectrum of density (scalar metric) perturbations and\ngravitational waves (tensor metric perturbations). Detection of a stochastic\ngravitational-wave background is essential for identifying this unmistakable\nsignature. Polarization of the cosmic microwave background can isolate these\ntensor modes in a model-independent way and thereby circumvent the\ncosmic-variance limit to detecting a small tensor signal with only a\ntemperature map. Here we assess the detectability of a gravity-wave background\nwith a temperature and polarization map. For detector sensitivities better than\n$10-20 \\mu K \\sqrt{sec}$, the sensitivity to a tensor signal is always\ndominated by the polarization map. With a detector sensitivity of order $1 \\mu\nK \\sqrt{sec}$, polarization could improve on a temperature-map sensitivity to\ntensor modes by two to three orders of magnitude. Even a small amount of\nreionization substantially enhances tensor-mode detectability. We also argue\nthat the sensitivity of the Planck Surveyor to tensor modes is significantly\nimproved with polarization, even taking into account the resulting degradation\nof the intensity determination in the high-frequency channels.\n", "  We investigate the possibility that cosmic rays of energy larger than the\nGreisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff are not nucleons, but a new stable, massive,\nhadron that appears in many extensions of the standard model. We focus\nprimarily on the S^0, a uds-gluino bound state. The range of the S^0 through\nthe cosmic background radiation is significantly longer than the range of\nnucleons, and therefore can originate from sources at cosmoglogical distances.\n", "  The generation of primordial magnetic fields from cosmological phase\ntransitions is discussed, paying particular attention to the electroweak\ntransition and to the various definitions of the `average' field that have been\nput forward. It is emphasised that only the volume average has dynamical\nsignificance as a seed for galactic dynamos. On rather general grounds of\ncausality and energy conservation, it is shown that, in the absence of MHD\neffects that transfer power in the magnetic field from small to large scales,\nprocesses occurring at the electroweak transition cannot generate fields\nstronger than $10^{-20}$ Gauss on a scale of 0.5 Mpc. However, it is\nimplausible that this upper bound could ever be reached, as it would require\nall the energy in the Universe to be turned into a magnetic field coherent at\nthe horizon scale. Non-linear MHD effects seem therefore to be necessary if the\nelectroweak transition is to create a primordial seed field.\n", "  We present a new approach to calculating the statistical distributions for\nmagnification, shear, and rotation of images of cosmological sources due to\ngravitational lensing. In this approach one specifies an underlying\nRobertson-Walker cosmological model together with relevant information on the\nclumping of matter on scales much smaller than the Hubble radius. The geodesic\ndeviation equation is then integrated backwards in time until the desired\nredshift is reached, using a Monte Carlo procedure wherein each photon beam in\neffect ``creates its own universe'' as it propagates. The approach is somewhat\nsimilar to that used in ``Swiss cheese'' models, but the ``cheese'' has been\ncompletely eliminated, the matter distribution in the ``voids'' need not be\nspherically symmetric, and the total mass in each void need equal the\ncorresponding Robertson-Walker mass only on average. We show that when the\nmatter in the universe consists of point masses, the statistical distributions\nof the lensing images are essentially independent of both the mass spectrum and\nclustering properties of the point masses, provided that the clustering is\nspherical. We apply our results (i) to argue that the positive correlation\nrecently found between quasar luminosity and the number of absorption line\nsystems is not likely to be due to lensing, and (ii) to determine the amount of\n``noise'' and possible bias produced by lensing in measurements of $q_0$ using\ndistant supernovae.\n", "  %auto-ignore This paper has been withdrawn by the author. The attribution of\nhard spectral features of x-ray novae to neutron star surfaces and gap\naccretion was incorrect.\n", "  We investigate the peculiar velocity field due to long cosmic strings in\nseveral cosmological models and analyse the influence of a nonscaling behaviour\nof the string network, which is expected in open cosmological models or models\nwith a cosmological constant. It is shown that the deviation of the propability\ndistribution of the peculiar velocity field from the normal distribution is\nonly weak in all models. It is further argued that one can not necessarily\nobtain the parameter $\\beta=\\Omega_{0}^{0.6}/b$ from density and velocity\nfields, where $\\Omega_0$ is the density parameter and $b$ the linear biasing\nparameter, if cosmic strings are responsible for structure formation in the\nuniverse. An explanation for this finding is given.\n", "  Forthcoming high-resolution observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) radiation will generate datasets many orders of magnitude larger than\nhave been obtained to date. The size and complexity of such datasets presents a\nvery serious challenge to analysing them with existing or anticipated\ncomputers. Here we present an investigation of the currently favored algorithm\nfor obtaining the power spectrum from a sky-temperature map --- the quadratic\nestimator. We show that, whilst improving on direct evaluation of the\nlikelihood function, current implementations still inherently scale as the\nequivalent of the cube of the number of pixels or worse, and demonstrate the\ncritical importance of choosing the right implementation for a particular\ndataset.\n", "  We present a new derivation of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy\nspectrum from the Ostriker-Vishniac effect for an open, flat, or closed\nUniverse, and calculate the anisotropy expected in cold dark-matter (CDM)\nmodels. We provide simple semi-analytic fitting formulas for the Vishniac power\nspectrum that can be used to evaluate the expected anisotropy in CDM models for\nany arbitrary ionization history. In a flat Universe, CDM models normalized to\ncluster abundances produce rms temperature anisotropies of 0.8--2.4 $\\mu$K on\narcminute angular scales for a constant ionization fraction of unity, whereas\nan ionization fraction of 0.2 yields rms anisotropies of 0.3--0.8 $\\mu$K. In an\nopen and/or high-baryon-density Universe, the level of anisotropy is somewhat\nhigher. The signal in some of these models may be detectable with planned\ninterferometry experiments. The damping of the acoustic peaks in the\nprimary-anisotropy spectrum at degree angular scales depends primarily on the\noptical depth and only secondarily on the epoch of reionization. On the other\nhand, the amplitude of Ostriker-Vishniac anisotropies depends sensitively on\nthe epoch of reionization. Therefore, when combined with the estimate of the\nreionization optical depth provided by maps of degree-scale anisotropies, the\nOstriker-Vishniac effect can provide a unique probe of the epoch of\nreionization.\n", "  We study the transition from radiation domination to matter domination in\nJordan-Brans-Dicke theory, in particular examining how the Hubble length at\nequality depends on the coupling parameter $\\omega$. We consider the prospects\nfor using high-accuracy microwave anisotropy and large-scale structure data to\nconstrain $\\omega$ more strongly than by conventional solar system gravity\nexperiments.\n", "  If primordial scalar and tensor perturbation spectra can be inferred from\nobservations of the cosmic background radiation and large-scale structure, then\none might hope to reconstruct a unique single-field inflaton potential capable\nof generating the observed spectra. In this paper we examine conditions under\nwhich such a potential can be reliably reconstructed. For it to be possible at\nall, the spectra must be well fit by a Taylor series expansion. A complete\nreconstruction requires a statistically-significant tensor mode to be measured\nin the microwave background. We find that the observational uncertainties\ndominate the theoretical error from use of the slow-roll approximation, and\nconclude that the reconstruction procedure will never insidiously lead to an\nirrelevant potential.\n", "  We investigate the effect of gravitational lensing by matter distribution in\nthe universe on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization power\nspectra and temperature-polarization cross-correlation spectrum. As in the case\nof temperature spectrum gravitational lensing leads to smoothing of narrow\nfeatures and enhancement of power on the damping tail of the power spectrum.\nBecause acoustic peaks in polarization spectra are narrower than in the\ntemperature spectrum the smoothing effect is significantly larger and can reach\nup to 10\\% for $l<1000$ and even more above that. A qualitatively new feature\nis the generation of $B$ type polarization even when only $E$ is intrinsically\npresent, such as in the case of pure scalar perturbations. This may be directly\nobserved with Planck and other future small scale polarization experiments. The\ngravitational lensing effect is incorporated in the new version (2.4) of\nCMBFAST code.\n", "  We argue that due to various restrictions cosmic strings and monopole-string\nnetworks are not likely to produce the observed flux of ultra-high energy\ncosmic rays (UHECR). Among the topological defects studied so far, the most\npromising UHECR sources are necklaces and monopolonia. Other viable sources\nwhich are similar to topological defects are relic superheavy particles. All\nthese sources have an excess of pions (and thus photons) over nucleons at\nproduction. We demonstrate that in the case of necklaces the diffuse proton\nflux can be larger than photon flux, due to absorption of the latter on\nradiobackground, while monopolonia and relic particles are concentrated in the\nGalactic halo, and the photon flux dominates. Another signature of the latter\nsources is anisotropy imposed by asymmetric position of the sun in the Galactic\nhalo. In all cases considered so far, including necklaces, photons must be\npresent in ultra-high energy radiation observed from topological defects, and\nexperimental discrimination between photon-induced and proton-induced extensive\nair showers can give a clue to the origin of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.\n", "  To extract reliable cosmic parameters from cosmic microwave background\ndatasets, it is essential to show that the data are not contaminated by\nresidual non-cosmological signals. We describe general statistical approaches\nto this problem, with an emphasis on the case in which there are two datasets\nthat can be checked for consistency. A first visual step is the Wiener filter\nmapping from one set of data onto the pixel basis of another. For more\nquantitative analyses we develop and apply both Bayesian and frequentist\ntechniques. We define the ``contamination parameter'' and advocate the\ncalculation of its probability distribution as a means of examining the\nconsistency of two datasets. The closely related ``probability enhancement\nfactor'' is shown to be a useful statistic for comparison; it is significantly\nbetter than a number of chi-squared quantities we consider. Our methods can be\nused: internally (between different subsets of a dataset) or externally\n(between different experiments); for observing regions that completely overlap,\npartially overlap or overlap not at all; and for observing strategies that\ndiffer greatly.\n  We apply the methods to check the consistency (internal and external) of the\nMSAM92, MSAM94 and Saskatoon Ring datasets. From comparing the two MSAM\ndatasets, we find that the most probable level of contamination is 12%, with no\ncontamination only 1.05 times less probable, and 100% contamination strongly\nruled out at over 2 X 10^5 times less probable. From comparing the 1992 MSAM\nflight with the Saskatoon data we find the most probable level of contamination\nto be 50%, with no contamination only 1.6 times less probable and 100%\ncontamination 13 times less probable. [Truncated]\n", "  In a class of models designed to solve the cosmological constant problem by\ncoupling scalar or tensor classical fields to the space-time curvature, the\nuniversal scale factor grows as a power law in the age, $a \\propto t^\\alpha$,\nregardless of the matter content or cosmological epoch. We investigate\nconstraints on such \"power-law cosmologies\" from the present age of the\nUniverse, the magnitude-redshift relation, and from primordial nucleosynthesis.\nConstraints from the current age of the Universe and from the high-redshift\nsupernovae data require \"large\" $\\alpha$ ($\\approx 1$), while consistency with\nthe inferred primordial abundances of deuterium and helium-4 forces $\\alpha$ to\nlie in a very narrow range around a lower value ($\\approx 0.55$). Inconsistency\nbetween these independent cosmological constraints suggests that such power-law\ncosmologies are not viable.\n", "  Damour and Mukhanov have recently devised circumstances in which inflation\nmay continue during the oscillatory phase which ensues once the inflaton field\nreaches the minimum of its potential. We confirm the existence of this\nphenomenon by numerical integration. In such circumstances the quantification\nof the amount of inflation requires particular care. We use a definition based\non the decrease of the comoving Hubble length, and show that Damour and\nMukhanov overestimated the amount of inflation occurring. We use the numerical\ncalculations to check the validity of analytic approximations.\n", "  In a supernova core, magnetic fields cause a directional variation of the\nneutrino refractive index so that resonant flavor oscillations would lead to a\ndeformation of the \"neutrinosphere\" for, say, tau neutrinos. The associated\nanisotropic neutrino emission was proposed as a possible origin of the observed\npulsar proper motions. We argue that this effect was vastly overestimated\nbecause the variation of the temperature over the deformed neutrinosphere is\nnot an adequate measure for the anisotropy of neutrino emission. The neutrino\nflux is generated inside the neutron star core and is transported through the\natmosphere at a constant luminosity, forcing the temperature gradient in the\natmosphere to adjust to the inflow of energy from below. Therefore, no emission\nanisotropy is caused by a deformation of the neutrinosphere to lowest order. An\nestimate of the higher-order corrections must take into account the modified\natmospheric temperature profile in response to the deformation of the\nneutrinosphere and the corresponding feedback on the core. We go through this\nexercise in the framework of a simplified model which can be solved\nanalytically.\n", "  Gravitational lensing distorts the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nanisotropies and imprints a characteristic pattern onto it. The distortions\ndepend on the projected matter density between today and redshift $z \\sim\n1100$. In this paper we develop a method for a direct reconstruction of the\nprojected matter density from the CMB anisotropies. This reconstruction is\nobtained by averaging over quadratic combinations of the derivatives of CMB\nfield. We test the method using simulations and show that it can successfully\nrecover projected density profile of a cluster of galaxies if there are\nmeasurable anisotropies on scales smaller than the characteristic cluster size.\nIn the absence of sufficient small scale power the reconstructed maps have low\nsignal to noise on individual structures, but can give a positive detection of\nthe power spectrum or when cross correlated with other maps of large scale\nstructure. We develop an analytic method to reconstruct the power spectrum\nincluding the effects of noise and beam smoothing. Tests with Monte Carlo\nsimulations show that we can recover the input power spectrum both on large and\nsmall scales, provided that we use maps with sufficiently low noise and high\nangular resolution.\n", "  We present an explicit observationally acceptable model for evolution from\ninflation to the present epoch under the assumption that the entropy and matter\nof the familiar universe are from gravitational particle production at the end\nof inflation. This eliminates the problem of finding a satisfactory coupling of\nthe inflaton and matter fields. Since the inflaton potential $V(\\phi)$ may be a\nmonotonic function of the inflaton $\\phi$, the inflaton energy could produce an\nobservationally significant effective cosmological constant, as in\nquintessence.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss the potential importance of measuring the CMB\nanisotropy bispectrum. We develop a formalism for computing the bispectrum and\nfor measuring it from microwave background maps. As an example, we compute the\nbispectrum resulting from the 2nd order Rees-Sciama effect, and find that is\nundetectable with current and upcoming missions.\n", "  We extend, for the case of a general scalar potential, the inflaton-graviton\nFeynman rules recently developed by Iliopoulos {\\it et al.} As an application\nwe compute the leading term, for late co-moving times, of the one loop back\nreaction on the expansion rate for $V(\\phi) = \\frac12 m^2 \\phi^2$. This is\nexpressed as the logarithmic time derivative of the scale factor in the\ncoordinate system for which the expectation value of the metric has the form:\n$<0 | g_{\\mu\\nu}({\\bar t},{\\vec x}) | 0 > dx^{\\mu} dx^{\\nu} = - d{\\bar t}^2 +\na^2({\\bar t}) d{\\vec x} \\cdot d{\\vec x}$. This quantity should be a gauge\nindependent observable. Our result for it agrees exactly with that inferred\nfrom the effect previously computed by Mukhanov {\\it et al.} using canonical\nquantization. It is significant that the two calculations were made with\ncompletely different schemes for fixing the gauge, and that our computation was\ndone using the standard formalism of covariant quantization. This should settle\nsome of the issues recently raised by Unruh.\n", "  We consider quantum mechanical corrections to a homogeneous, isotropic and\nspatially flat geometry whose scale factor expands classically as a general\npower of the co-moving time. The effects of both gravitons and the scalar\ninflaton are computed at one loop using the manifestly causal formalism of\nSchwinger with the Feynman rules recently developed by Iliopoulos {\\it et al.}\nWe find no significant effect, in marked contrast with the result obtained by\nMukhanov {\\it et al.} for chaotic inflation based on a quadratic potential. By\napplying the canonical technique of Mukhanov {\\it et al.} to the exponential\npotentials of power law inflation, we show that the two methods produce the\nsame results, within the approximations employed, for these backgrounds. We\ntherefore conclude that the shape of the inflaton potential can have an\nenormous impact on the one loop back-reaction.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of the recently proposed model of assisted\ninflation. In this model an arbitrary number of scalar fields with exponential\npotentials evolve towards an inflationary scaling solution, even if each of the\nindividual potentials is too steep to support inflation on its own. By choosing\nan appropriate rotation in field space we can write down explicitly the\npotential for the weighted mean field along the scaling solution and for fields\northogonal to it. This demonstrates that the potential has a global minimum\nalong the scaling solution. We show that the potential close to this attractor\nin the rotated field space is analogous to a hybrid inflation model, but with\nthe vacuum energy having an exponential dependence upon a dilaton field. We\npresent analytic solutions describing homogeneous and inhomogeneous\nperturbations about the attractor solution without resorting to slow-roll\napproximations. We discuss the curvature and isocurvature perturbation spectra\nproduced from vacuum fluctuations during assisted inflation.\n", "  Residual velocity dispersion in cold dark matter induces stresses which lead\nto effects that are absent in the idealized dust model. A previous Newtonian\nanalysis showed how this approach can provide a theoretical foundation for the\nphenomenological adhesion model. We develop a relativistic kinetic theory\ngeneralization which also incorporates the anisotropic velocity dispersion that\nwill typically be present. In addition to density perturbations, we consider\nthe rotational and shape distortion properties of clustering. These quantities\ntogether characterize the linear development of density inhomogeneity, and we\nfind exact solutions for their evolution. As expected, the corrections are\nsmall and arise only in the decaying modes, but their effect is interesting.\nOne of the modes for density perturbations decays less rapidly than the\nstandard decaying mode. The new rotational mode generates precession of the\naxis of rotation. The new shape modes produce additional distortion that\nremains frozen in during the subsequent (linear) evolution, despite the rapid\ndecay of the terms that caused it.\n", "  It has normally been assumed that primordial black holes (PBHs) always form\nwith mass approximately equal to the mass contained within the horizon at that\ntime. Recent work studying the application of critical phenomena in\ngravitational collapse to PBH formation has shown that in fact, at a fixed\ntime, PBHs with a range of masses are formed. When calculating the PBH initial\nmass function it is usually assumed that all PBHs form at the same horizon\nmass. It is not clear, however, that it is consistent to consider the spread in\nthe mass of PBHs formed at a single horizon mass, whilst neglecting the range\nof horizon masses at which PBHs can form. We use the excursion set formalism to\ncompute the PBH initial mass function, allowing for PBH formation at a range of\nhorizon masses, for two forms of the density perturbation spectrum. First we\nexamine power-law spectra with $n>1$, where PBHs form on small scales. We find\nthat, in the limit where the number of PBHs formed is small enough to satisfy\nthe observational constraints on their initial abundance, the mass function\napproaches that found by Niemeyer and Jedamzik under the assumption that all\nPBHs form at a single horizon mass. Second, we consider a flat perturbation\nspectrum with a spike at a scale corresponding to horizon mass $\\sim 0.5\nM_{\\odot}$, and compare the resulting PBH mass function with that of the MACHOs\n(MAssive Compact Halo Objects) detected by microlensing observations. The\npredicted mass spectrum appears significantly wider than the steeply-falling\nspectrum found observationally.\n", "  The primary results of most observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nanisotropy are estimates of the angular power spectrum averaged through some\nbroad band, called band-powers. These estimates are in turn what are used to\nproduce constraints on cosmological parameters due to all CMB observations.\nEssential to this estimation of cosmological parameters is the calculation of\nthe expected band-power for a given experiment, given a theoretical power\nspectrum. Here we derive the \"band power\" window function which should be used\nfor this calculation, and point out that it is not equivalent to the window\nfunction used to calculate the variance. This important distinction has been\nabsent from much of the literature: the variance window function is often used\nas the band-power window function. We discuss the validity of this assumed\nequivalence, the role of window functions for experiments that constrain the\npower in {\\it multiple} bands, and summarize a prescription for reporting\nexperimental results. The analysis methods detailed here are applied in a\ncompanion paper to three years of data from the Medium Scale Anisotropy\nMeasurement.\n", "  We compute, from first principles, the quantum fluctuations about instanton\nsaddle points of the Euclidean path integral for Einstein gravity coupled to a\nscalar field. The Euclidean two-point correlator is analytically continued into\nthe Lorentzian region where it describes the quantum mechanical vacuum\nfluctuations in the state described by no boundary proposal initial conditions.\nWe concentrate on the density perturbations in open inflationary universes\nproduced from cosmological instantons, describing the differences between\nnon-singular Coleman-De Luccia and singular Hawking-Turok instantons. We show\nhow the Euclidean path integral uniquely specifies the fluctuations in both\ncases.\n", "  Inflation leads us to expect a spectrum of gravitational waves (tensor\nperturbations) extending to wavelengths much bigger than the present observable\nhorizon. Although these gravity waves are not directly observable, the energy\ndensity that they contribute grows in importance during the radiation- and\ndust-dominated ages of the universe. We show that the back reaction of tensor\nperturbations during matter domination is limited from above, since\ngravitational waves of wavelength $\\lambda$ have a share of the total energy\ndensity $\\Delta \\rho(\\lambda)/\\rho$ during matter domination that is at most\nequal to the share of the total energy density that they had when the mode\n$\\lambda$ exited the Hubble radius $H^{-1}$ during inflation. This work is to\nbe contrasted to that of Sahni, who analyzed the energy density of gravity\nwaves only insofar as their wavelengths are smaller than $H^{-1}$. Such a\ncut-off in the spectral energy of gravity waves leads to the breakdown of\nenergy conservation, and we show that this anomaly is eliminated simply by\ntaking into account the energy density and pressure of long wavelength\ngravitational waves as well as short wavelength ones.\n", "  We investigate the effect of wiggly cosmic strings on the cosmic microwave\nbackground radiation anisotropy and matter power spectrum by modifying the\nstring network model used by Albrecht et al.. We employ the wiggly equation of\nstate for strings and the one-scale model for the cosmological evolution of\ncertain network characteristics. For the same choice of simulation parameters\nwe compare the results with and without including wiggliness in the model and\nfind that wiggliness together with the accompanying low string velocities lead\nto a significant peak in the microwave background anisotropy and to an\nenhancement in the matter power spectrum. For the cosmologies we have\ninvestigated (standard CDM, and, CDM plus cosmological constant), and within\nthe limitations of our modeling of the string network, the anisotropy is in\nreasonable agreement with current observations but the COBE normalized\namplitude of density perturbations is lower than what the data suggests. In the\ncase of a cosmological constant and CDM model, a bias factor of about 2 is\nrequired.\n", "  We obtain the photon spectrum induced by a cosmic background of unstable\nneutrinos. We study the spectrum in a variety of cosmological scenarios and\nalso we allow for the neutrinos having a momentum distribution (only a critical\nmatter dominated universe and neutrinos at rest have been considered until\nnow). Our results can be helpful when extracting bounds on neutrino electric\nand magnetic moments from cosmic photon background observations.\n", "  Recent numerical evidence suggests that a mass spectrum of primordial black\nholes (PBHs) is produced as a consequence of near critical gravitational\ncollapse. Assuming that these holes formed from the initial density\nperturbations seeded by inflation, we calculate model independent upper bounds\non the mass variance at the reheating temperature by requiring the mass density\nnot exceed the critical density and the photon emission not exceed current\ndiffuse gamma-ray measurements. We then translate these results into bounds on\nthe spectral index n by utilizing the COBE data to normalize the mass variance\nat large scales, assuming a constant power law, then scaling this result to the\nreheating temperature. We find that our bounds on n differ substantially\n(\\delta n > 0.05) from those calculated using initial mass functions derived\nunder the assumption that the black hole mass is proportional to the horizon\nmass at the collapse epoch. We also find a change in the shape of the diffuse\ngamma-ray spectrum which results from the Hawking radiation. Finally, we study\nthe impact of a nonzero cosmological constant and find that the bounds on n are\nstrengthened considerably if the universe is indeed vacuum-energy dominated\ntoday.\n", "  Since an acceptable dark matter candidate may interact only weakly with\nordinary matter and radiation, it is of interest to consider the limiting case\nwhere the dark matter interacts only with gravity and itself, the matter\noriginating by the gravitational particle production at the end of inflation.\nWe use the bounds on the present dark mass density and the measured large-scale\nfluctuations in the thermal cosmic background radiation to constrain the two\nparameters in a self-interaction potential that is a sum of quadratic and\nquartic terms in a single scalar dark matter field that is minimally coupled to\ngravity. In quintessential inflation, where the temperature at the end of\ninflation is relatively low, the field starts acting like cold dark matter\nrelatively late, shortly before the epoch of equal mass densities in matter and\nradiation. This could have observable consequences for galaxy formation. We\nrespond to recent criticisms of the quintessential inflation scenario, since\nthese issues also apply to elements of the noninteracting dark matter picture.\n", "  We explore a model in which the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ and the\ndensity contrast at the time of recombination $\\sigma_{rec}$ are random\nvariables, whose range and {\\it a priori} probabilities are determined by the\nlaws of physics. (Such models arise naturally in the framework of inflationary\ncosmology.) Based on the assumption that we are typical observers, we show that\nthe order of magnitude coincidence among the three timescales: the time of\ngalaxy formation, the time when the cosmological constant starts to dominate\nthe cosmic energy density, and the present age of the universe, finds a natural\nexplanation. We also discuss the probability distribution for $\\sigma_{rec}$,\nand find that it is peaked near the observationally suggested values, for a\nwide class of {\\it a priori} distributions.\n", "  We consider the generation of the scalar mode of the metric perturbations\nduring preheating stage in a two field model with the potential $V(\\phi, \\chi)=\n{m^{2}\\phi^{2}\\over 2}+{g^{2}\\phi^{2}\\chi^{2}\\over 2}$. We discuss two possible\nsources of such perturbations: a) due to the coupling between the perturbation\nof the matter field $\\delta \\chi$ and the background part of the matter field\n$\\chi_{0}(t)$, b) due to non-linear fluctuations in a condensate of\n``particles'' of the field $\\chi$. Both types of the metric perturbations are\nassumed to be small, and estimated using the linear theory of the metric\nperturbations. We estimate analytically the upper limit of the amplitude of the\nmetric perturbations for all scales in the limit of so-called broad resonance,\nand show that the large scale metric perturbations are very small, and taking\nthem into account does not influence the standard picture of the production of\nthe metric perturbations in inflationary scenario.\n", "  We quantify the presence of direct processes in the S-matrix of chaotic\nmicrowave cavities with absorption in the one-channel case. To this end the\nfull distribution P_S(S) of the S-matrix, i.e. S=\\sqrt{R}e^{i\\theta}, is\nstudied in cavities with time-reversal symmetry for different antenna coupling\nstrengths T_a or direct processes. The experimental results are compared with\nrandom-matrix calculations and with numerical simulations based on the\nHeidelberg approach including absorption. The theoretical result is a\ngeneralization of the Poisson kernel. The experimental and the numerical\ndistributions are in excellent agreement with random-matrix predictions for all\ncases.\n", "  First order corrections to the Unruh effect are calculated from a model of an\naccelerated particle detector of finite mass. We show that quantum smearing of\nthe trajectory and large recoil essentially do not modify the Unruh effect.\nNevertheless, we find corrections to the thermal distribution and to the Unruh\ntemperature. In a certain limit, when the distribution at equilibrium remains\nexactly thermal, the corrected temperature is found to be $T = T_U( 1 -\nT_U/M)$, where $T_U$ is the Unruh temperature. We estimate the consequent\ncorrections to the Hawking temperature and the black hole entropy, and comment\non the relationship to the problem of trans-planckian frequencies.\n", "  The topologies of event horizons are investigated. Considering the existence\nof the endpoint of the event horizon, it cannot be differentiable. Then there\nare the new possibilities of the topology of the event horizon though they are\nexcluded in smooth event horizons. The relation between the topology of the\nevent horizon and the endpoint of it is revealed. A torus event horizon is\ncaused by two-dimensional endpoints. One-dimensional endpoints provide the\ncoalescence of spherical event horizons. Moreover, these aspects can be removed\nby an appropriate timeslicing. The result will be useful to discuss the\nstability and generality of the topology of the event horizon.\n", "  A class of decoherence schemes is described for implementing the principles\nof generalized quantum theory in reparametrization-invariant `hyperbolic'\nmodels such as minisuperspace quantum cosmology. The connection with\nsum-over-histories constructions is exhibited and the physical equivalence or\ninequivalence of different such schemes is analyzed. The discussion focuses on\ncomparing constructions based on the Klein-Gordon product with those based on\nthe induced (a.k.a. Rieffel, Refined Algebraic, Group Averaging, or Spectral\nAnalysis) inner product. It is shown that the Klein-Gordon and induced products\ncan be simply related for the models of interest. This fact is then used to\nestablish isomorphisms between certain decoherence schemes based on these\nproducts.\n", "  This paper treats boundary conditions on black hole horizons for the full\n3+1D Einstein equations. Following a number of authors, the apparent horizon is\nemployed as the inner boundary on a space slice. It is emphasized that a\nfurther condition is necessary for the system to be well posed; the\n``prescribed curvature conditions\" are therefore proposed to complete the\ncoordinate conditions at the black hole. These conditions lead to a system of\ntwo 2D elliptic differential equations on the inner boundary surface, which\ncoexist nicely to the 3D equation for maximal slicing (or related slicing\nconditions). The overall 2D/3D system is argued to be well posed and globally\nwell behaved. The importance of ``boundary conditions without boundary values\"\nis emphasized. This paper is the first of a series. This revised version makes\nminor additions and corrections to the previous version.\n", "  The scattering amplitudes for the perturbed fields of the N=2 supergravity\nabout the extreme Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole is examined. Owing to the\nfact that the extreme hole is a BPS state of the theory and preserves an\nunbroken global supersymmetry(N=1), the scattering amplitudes of the component\nfields should be related to each other. In this paper, we derive the formula of\nthe transformation of the scattering amplitudes.\n", "  The Nernst formulation of the third law of ordinary thermodynamics (often\nreferred to as the ``Nernst theorem'') asserts that the entropy, $S$, of a\nsystem must go to zero (or a ``universal constant'') as its temperature, $T$,\ngoes to zero. This assertion is commonly considered to be a fundamental law of\nthermodynamics. As such, it seems to spoil the otherwise perfect analogy\nbetween the ordinary laws of thermodynamics and the laws of black hole\nmechanics, since rotating black holes in general relativity do not satisfy the\nanalog of the ``Nernst theorem''. The main purpose of this paper is to attempt\nto lay to rest the ``Nernst theorem'' as a law of thermodynamics. We consider a\nboson (or fermion) ideal gas with its total angular momentum, $J$, as an\nadditional state parameter, and we analyze the conditions on the single\nparticle density of states, $g(\\epsilon,j)$, needed for the Nernst formulation\nof the third law to hold. (Here, $\\epsilon$ and $j$ denote the single particle\nenergy and angular momentum.) Although it is shown that the Nernst formulation\nof the third law does indeed hold under a wide range of conditions, some simple\nclasses of examples of densities of states which violate the ``Nernst theorem''\nare given. In particular, at zero temperature, a boson (or fermion) gas\nconfined to a circular string (whose energy is proportional to its length) not\nonly violates the ``Nernst theorem'' also but reproduces some other\nthermodynamic properties of an extremal rotating black hole.\n", "  We consider the perturbations of a relativistic star as an initial-value\nproblem. Having discussed the formulation of the problem (the perturbation\nequations and the appropriate boundary conditions at the centre and the surface\nof the star) in detail we evolve the equations numerically from several\ndifferent sets of initial data. In all the considered cases we find that the\nresulting gravitational waves carry the signature of several of the star's\npulsation modes. Typically, the fluid $f$-mode, the first two $p$-modes and the\nslowest damped gravitational $w$-mode are present in the signal. This indicates\nthat the pulsation modes may be an interesting source for detectable\ngravitational waves from colliding neutron stars or supernovae. We also survey\nthe literature and find several indications of mode presence in numerical\nsimulations of rotating core collapse and coalescing neutron stars. If such\nmode-signals can be detected by future gravitational-wave antennae one can hope\nto infer detailed information about neutron stars. Since a perturbation\nevolution should adequately describe the late time behaviour of a dynamically\nexcited neutron star, the present work can also be used as a bench-mark test\nfor future fully nonlinear simulations.\n", "  This paper studies the decay of a large, closed domain wall in a closed\nuniverse. Such walls can form in the presence of a broken, discrete symmetry.\nWe introduce a novel process of quantum decay for such a wall, in which the\nvacuum fluctuates from one discrete state to another throughout one half of the\nuniverse, so that the wall decays into pure field energy. Equivalently, the\nfluctuation can be thought of as the nucleation of a second domain wall of zero\nsize, followed by its growth by quantum tunnelling and its collision with the\nfirst wall, annihilating both. The barrier factor for this quantum tunneling is\ncalculated by guessing and verifying a Euclidean instanton for the two-wall\nsystem. We also discuss the classical origin and evolution of closed,\ntopologically spherical domain walls in the early universe, through a\n\"budding-off\" process involving closed domain walls larger than the Hubble\nradius. This paper is the first of a series on this subject.\n", "  This paper studies the decay of a large, closed domain wall in a closed\nuniverse. Such walls can form in the presence of a broken, discrete symmetry.\nWe study a novel process of quantum decay for such a wall, in which the vacuum\nfluctuates from one discrete state to another throughout one half of the\nuniverse, so that the wall decays into pure field energy. Equivalently, the\nfluctuation can be thought of as the nucleation of a second closed domain wall\nof zero size, followed by its growth by quantum tunnelling and its collision\nwith the first wall, annihilating both. We therefore study the 2-wall system\ncoupled to a spherically symmetric gravitational field. We derive a simple form\nof the 2-wall action, use Dirac quantization, obtain the 2-wall wave function\nfor annihilation, find from it the barrier factor for this quantum tunneling,\nand thereby get the decay probability. This is the second paper of a series.\n", "  It is shown analytically that an external tidal gravitational field increases\nthe secular stability of a fully general relativistic, rigidly rotating neutron\nstar that is near marginal stability, protecting it against gravitational\ncollapse. This stabilization is shown to result from the simple fact that the\nenergy $\\delta M(Q,R)$ required to raise a tide on such a star, divided by the\nsquare of the tide's quadrupole moment $Q$, is a decreasing function of the\nstar's radius $R$, $(d/dR)[\\delta M(Q,R)/Q^2]<0$ (where, as $R$ changes, the\nstar's structure is changed in accord with the star's fundamental mode of\nradial oscillation). If $(d/dR)[\\delta M(Q,R)/Q^2]$ were positive, the tidal\ncoupling would destabilize the star. As an application, a rigidly rotating,\nmarginally secularly stable neutron star in an inspiraling binary system will\nbe protected against secular collapse, and against dynamical collapse, by tidal\ninteraction with its companion. The ``local-asymptotic-rest-frame'' tools used\nin the analysis are somewhat unusual and may be powerful in other studies of\nneutron stars and black holes interacting with an external environment. As a\nbyproduct of the analysis, in an appendix the influence of tidal interactions\non mass-energy conservation is elucidated.\n", "  We consider the Hamiltonian dynamics of spherically symmetric Einstein\ngravity with a thin null-dust shell, under boundary conditions that fix the\nevolution of the spatial hypersurfaces at the two asymptotically flat\ninfinities of a Kruskal-like manifold. The constraints are eliminated via a\nKuchar-type canonical transformation and Hamiltonian reduction. The reduced\nphase space $\\tilde\\Gamma$ consists of two disconnected copies of $R^4$, each\nassociated with one direction of the shell motion. The right-moving and\nleft-moving test shell limits can be attached to the respective components of\n$\\tilde\\Gamma$ as smooth boundaries with topology $R^3$. Choosing the\nright-hand-side and left-hand-side masses as configuration variables provides a\nglobal canonical chart on each component of $\\tilde\\Gamma$, and renders the\nHamiltonian simple, but encodes the shell dynamics in the momenta in a\nconvoluted way. Choosing the shell curvature radius and the \"interior\" mass as\nconfiguration variables renders the shell dynamics transparent in an\narbitrarily specifiable stationary gauge \"exterior\" to the shell, but the\nresulting local canonical charts do not cover the three-dimensional subset of\n$\\tilde\\Gamma$ that corresponds to a horizon-straddling shell. When the\nevolution at the infinities is freed by introducing parametrization clocks, we\nfind on the unreduced phase space a global canonical chart that completely\ndecouples the physical degrees of freedom from the pure gauge degrees of\nfreedom. Replacing one infinity by a flat interior leads to analogous results,\nbut with the reduced phase space $R^2 \\cup R^2$. The utility of the results for\nquantization is discussed.\n", "  Here we study novel effects associated with electromagnetic wave propagation\nin a Robertson-Walker universe and the Schwarzschild spacetime with a small\namount of metric stochasticity. We find that localization of electromagnetic\nwaves occurs in a Robertson-Walker universe with time-independent metric\nstochasticity, while time-dependent metric stochasticity induces exponential\ninstability in the particle production rate. For the Schwarzschild metric,\ntime-independent randomness can decrease the total luminosity of Hawking\nradiation due to multiple scattering of waves outside the black hole and gives\nrise to event horizon fluctuations and thus fluctuations in the Hawking\ntemperature.\n", "  We give a comparative description of monopole and electrically charged\nspherically symmetric dust thin shells. Herewith we consider two of the most\ninteresting configurations: the hollow shell and shell, surrounding a body with\nopposite charge. The classification of shells in accordance with the types of\nblack holes and traversable wormholes is constructed. The theorems for the\nparameters of turning points are proved. Also for atomlike configurations the\neffects of screening (electrical case) and amplification (monopole case) of the\ninternal mass by shell charge are studied. Finally, one considers the quantum\naspects; herewith, exact solutions of wave equations and bound states spectra\nare found.\n", "  We perform fully relativistic calculations of binary neutron stars in\ncorotating, circular orbit. While Newtonian gravity allows for a strict\nequilibrium, a relativistic binary system emits gravitational radiation,\ncausing the system to lose energy and slowly spiral inwards. However, since\ninspiral occurs on a time scale much longer than the orbital period, we can\ntreat the binary to be in quasiequilibrium. In this approximation, we integrate\na subset of the Einstein equations coupled to the relativistic equation of\nhydrostatic equilibrium to solve the initial value problem for binaries of\narbitrary separation. We adopt a polytropic equation of state to determine the\nstructure and maximum mass of neutron stars in close binaries for polytropic\nindices n=1, 1.5 and 2. We construct sequences of constant rest-mass and locate\nturning points along energy equilibrium curves to identify the onset of orbital\ninstability. In particular, we locate the innermost stable circular orbit\n(ISCO) and its angular velocity. We construct the first contact binary systems\nin full general relativity. These arise whenever the equation of state is\nsufficiently soft >= 1.5. A radial stability analysis reveals no tendency for\nneutron stars in close binaries to collapse to black holes prior to merger.\n", "  A rotating star's oblateness creates a deformation in the gravitational field\noutside the star, which is measured by the quadrupole-moment tensor. We\nconsider the effect of the quadrupole moment on the orbital motion and rate of\ninspiral of a compact binary system, composed of neutron stars and/or black\nholes. We find that in the case of circular orbits, the quadrupole-monopole\ninteraction affects the relation between orbital radius and angular velocity,\nand also the rate of inspiral, by a quantity of order (v/c)^4, where v is the\norbital velocity and c the speed of light.\n", "  We consider the thermodynamic properties of the constant curvature black hole\nsolution recently found by Banados. We show that it is possible to compute the\nentropy and the quasilocal thermodynamics of the spacetime using the\nEinstein-Hilbert action of General Relativity. The constant curvature black\nhole has some unusual properties which have not been seen in other black hole\nspacetimes. The entropy of the black hole is not associated with the event\nhorizon; rather it is associated with the region between the event horizon and\nthe observer. Further, surfaces of constant internal energy are not isotherms\nso the first law of thermodynamics exists only in an integral form. These\nproperties arise from the unusual topology of the Euclidean black hole\ninstanton.\n", "  We discuss quantum inequalities for minimally coupled scalar fields in static\nspacetimes. These are inequalities which place limits on the magnitude and\nduration of negative energy densities. We derive a general expression for the\nquantum inequality for a static observer in terms of a Euclidean two-point\nfunction. In a short sampling time limit, the quantum inequality can be written\nas the flat space form plus subdominant correction terms dependent upon the\ngeometric properties of the spacetime. This supports the use of flat space\nquantum inequalities to constrain negative energy effects in curved spacetime.\nUsing the exact Euclidean two-point function method, we develop the quantum\ninequalities for perfectly reflecting planar mirrors in flat spacetime. We then\nlook at the quantum inequalities in static de~Sitter spacetime, Rindler\nspacetime and two- and four-dimensional black holes. In the case of a\nfour-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole, explicit forms of the inequality are\nfound for static observers near the horizon and at large distances. It is show\nthat there is a quantum averaged weak energy condition (QAWEC), which states\nthat the energy density averaged over the entire worldline of a static observer\nis bounded below by the vacuum energy of the spacetime. In particular, for an\nobserver at a fixed radial distance away from a black hole, the QAWEC says that\nthe averaged energy density can never be less than the Boulware vacuum energy\ndensity.\n", "  We discuss the underlying relativistic physics which causes neutron stars to\ncompress and collapse in close binary systems as has recently been observed in\nnumerical (3+1) dimensional general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations. We\nshow that compression is driven by velocity-dependent relativistic hydrodynamic\nterms which increase the self gravity of the stars. They also produce fluid\nmotion with respect to the corotating frame of the binary. We present numerical\nand analytic results which confirm that such terms are insignificant for\nuniform translation or when the hydrodynamics is constrained to rigid\ncorotation.\n  However, when the hydrodynamics is unconstrained, the neutron star fluid\nrelaxes to a compressed nonsynchronized state of almost no net intrinsic spin\nwith respect to a distant observer.\n  We also show that tidal decompression effects are much less than the\nvelocity-dependent compression terms. We discuss why several recent attempts to\nanalyze this effect with constrained hydrodynamics or an analysis of tidal\nforces do not observe compression. We argue that an independent test of this\nmust include unconstrained relativistic hydrodynamics to sufficiently high\norder that all relevant velocity-dependent terms and their possible\ncancellations are included.\n", "  There has been much recent work on quantum inequalities to constrain negative\nenergy. These are uncertainty principle-type restrictions on the magnitude and\nduration of negative energy densities or fluxes. We consider several examples\nof apparent failures of the quantum inequalities, which involve passage of an\nobserver through regions where the negative energy density becomes singular. We\nargue that this type of situation requires one to formulate quantum\ninequalities using sampling functions with compact support. We discuss such\ninequalities, and argue that they remain valid even in the presence of singular\nenergy densities.\n", "  The result that, for a scalar quantum field propagating on a ``trousers''\ntopology in 1+1 dimensions, the crotch singularity is a source for an infinite\nburst of energy has been used to argue against the occurrence of topology\nchange in quantum gravity. We draw attention to a conjecture due to Sorkin that\nit may be the particular type of topology change involved in the trousers\ntransition that is problematic and that other topology changes may not cause\nthe same difficulties. The conjecture links the singular behaviour to the\nexistence of ``causal discontinuities'' in the spacetime and relies on a\nclassification of topology changes using Morse theory. We investigate various\ntopology changing transitions, including the pair production of black holes and\nof topological geons, in the light of these ideas.\n", "  This is the first in a series of articles on the numerical solution of\nFriedrich's conformal field equations for Einstein's theory of gravity. We will\ndiscuss in this paper why one should be interested in applying the conformal\nmethod to physical problems and why there is good hope that this might even be\na good idea from the numerical point of view. We describe in detail the\nderivation of the conformal field equations in the spinor formalism which we\nuse for the implementation of the equations, and present all the equations as a\nreference for future work. Finally, we discuss the implications of the\nassumptions of a continuous symmetry.\n", "  This is the second in a series of articles on the numerical solution of\nFriedrich's conformal field equations for Einstein's theory of gravity. We will\ndiscuss in this paper the numerical methods used to solve the system of\nevolution equations obtained from the conformal field equations. In particular\nwe discuss in detail the choice of gauge source functions and the treatment of\nthe boundaries. Of particular importance is the process of ``radiation\nextraction'' which can be performed in a straightforward way in the present\nformalism.\n", "  Starting with a `bare' 4-dimensional differential manifold as a model of\nspacetime, we discuss the options one has for defining a volume element which\ncan be used for physical theories. We show that one has to prescribe a scalar\ndensity \\sigma. Whereas conventionally \\sqrt{|\\det g_{ij}|} is used for that\npurpose, with g_{ij} as the components of the metric, we point out other\npossibilities, namely \\sigma as a `dilaton' field or as a derived quantity from\neither a linear connection or a quartet of scalar fields, as suggested by\nGuendelman and Kaganovich.\n", "  The space of states and operators for a large class of background independent\ntheories of quantum spacetime dynamics is defined. The SU(2) spin networks of\nquantum general relativity are replaced by labelled compact two-dimensional\nsurfaces. The space of states of the theory is the direct sum of the spaces of\ninvariant tensors of a quantum group G_q over all compact (finite genus)\noriented 2-surfaces. The dynamics is background independent and locally causal.\nThe dynamics constructs histories with discrete features of spacetime geometry\nsuch as causal structure and multifingered time. For SU(2) the theory satisfies\nthe Bekenstein bound and the holographic hypothesis is recast in this\nformalism.\n", "  We analyze the core dynamics of critically coupled, superheavy gauge vortices\nin the (2+1) dimensional Einstein-Abelian-Higgs system. By numerically solving\nthe Eistein and field equations for various values of the symmetry breaking\nscale, we identify the regime in which static solutions cease to exist and\ntopological inflation begins. We explicitly include the topological winding of\nthe vortices into the calculation and extract the dependence on the winding of\nthe critical scale separating the static and inflating regimes. Extrapolation\nof our results suggests that topological inflation might occur within high\nwinding strings formed at the Grand Unified scale.\n", "  We revisit the question of the imposition of initial data representing\nastrophysical gravitational perturbations of black holes. We study their\ndynamics for the case of nonrotating black holes by numerically evolving the\nTeukolsky equation in the time domain. In order to express the Teukolsky\nfunction Psi explicitly in terms of hypersurface quantities, we relate it to\nthe Moncrief waveform phi_M through a Chandrasekhar transformation in the case\nof a nonrotating black hole. This relation between Psi and phi_M holds for any\nconstant time hypersurface and allows us to compare the computation of the\nevolution of Schwarzschild perturbations by the Teukolsky and by the Zerilli\nand Regge-Wheeler equations. We explicitly perform this comparison for the\nMisner initial data in the close limit approach. We evolve numerically both,\nthe Teukolsky (with the recent code of Ref. [1]) and the Zerilli equations,\nfinding complete agreement in resulting waveforms within numerical error. The\nconsistency of these results further supports the correctness of the numerical\ncode for evolving the Teukolsky equation as well as the analytic expressions\nfor Psi in terms only of the three-metric and the extrinsic curvature.\n", "  We analyze the \"F-locality condition\" (proposed by Kay to be a mathematical\nimplementation of a philosophical bias related to the equivalence principle, we\ncall it the \"GH-equivalence principle\"), which is often used to build a\ngeneralization of quantum field theory to non-globally hyperbolic spacetimes.\nIn particular we argue that the theorem proved by Kay, Radzikowski, and Wald to\nthe effect that time machines with compactly generated Cauchy horizons are\nincompatible with the F-locality condition actually does not support the\n\"chronology protection conjecture\", but rather testifies that the F-locality\ncondition must be modified or abandoned. We also show that this condition\nimposes a severe restriction on the geometry of the world (it is just this\nrestriction that comes into conflict with the existence of a time machine),\nwhich does not follow from the above mentioned philosophical bias. So, one need\nnot sacrifice the GH-equivalence principle to \"emend\" the F-locality condition.\nAs an example we consider a particular modification, the \"MF-locality\ncondition\". The theory obtained by replacing the F-locality condition with the\nMF-locality condition possesses a few attractive features. One of them is that\nit is consistent with both locality and the existence of time machines.\n", "  We examine the field equations of a self-gravitating global string in low\nenergy superstring gravity, allowing for an arbitrary coupling of the global\nstring to the dilaton. Massive and massless dilatons are considered. For the\nmassive dilaton the spacetime is similar to the recently discovered\nnon-singular time-dependent Einstein self-gravitating global string, but the\nmassless dilaton generically gives a singular spacetime, even allowing for\ntime-dependence. We also demonstrate a time-dependent non-singular\nstring/anti-string configuration, in which the string pair causes a\ncompactification of two of the spatial dimensions, albeit on a very large\nscale.\n", "  It is shown that in 2+1 dimensional gravity an open spacetime with timelike\nsources and total energy momentum cannot have a stable compactly generated\nCauchy horizon. This constitutes a proof of a version of Kabat's conjecture and\nshows, in particular, that not only a Gott pair cannot be formed from processes\nsuch as the decay of a single cosmic string as has been shown by Carroll et\nal., but that, in a precise sense, a time machine cannot be constructed at all.\n", "  Smolin has pointed out that the spin network formulation of quantum gravity\nwill not necessarily possess the long range correlations needed for a proper\nclassical limit; typically, the action of the scalar constraint is too local.\nThiemann's length operator is used to argue for a further restriction on the\naction of the scalar constraint: it should not introduce new edges of color\nunity into a spin network, but should rather change preexisting edges by $\\pm$\none unit of color. Smolin has proposed a specific ansatz for a correlated\nscalar constraint. This ansatz does not introduce color unity edges, but the\n[scalar, scalar] commutator is shown to be anomalous. In general, it will be\nhard to avoid anomalies, once correlation is introduced into the constraint;\nbut it is argued that the scalar constraint may not need to be anomaly-free\nwhen acting on the kinematic basis.\n", "  In recent years the threshold of black hole formation in spherically\nsymmetric gravitational collapse has been studied for a variety of matter\nmodels. In this paper the corresponding issue is investigated for a matter\nmodel significantly different from those considered so far in this context. We\nstudy the transition from dispersion to black hole formation in the collapse of\ncollisionless matter when the initial data is scaled. This is done by means of\na numerical code similar to those commonly used in plasma physics. The result\nis that for the initial data for which the solutions were computed, most of the\nmatter falls into the black hole whenever a black hole is formed. This results\nin a discontinuity in the mass of the black hole at the onset of black hole\nformation.\n", "  Positive definiteness of the quadratic part of the action of the\nHawking-Turok instanton is investigated. The Euclidean quadratic action for\nscalar perturbations is expressed in terms of a single gauge invariant quantity\n$q$. The mode functions satisfy a Schr\\\"odinger type equation with a potential\n$U$. It is shown that the potential $U$ tends to a positive constant at the\nregular end of the instanton. The detailed shape of $U$ depends on the initial\ndata of the instanton, on parameters of the background scalar field potential\n$V$ and on a positive integer, $p$, labeling different spherical harmonics. For\ncertain well behaved scalar field potentials it is proven analytically that for\n$p>1$ quadratic action is non-negative. For the lowest $p=1$ (homogeneous)\nharmonic numerical solution of the Schr\\\"odinger equation for different scalar\nfield potentials $V$ and different initial data show that in some cases the\npotential $U$ is negative in the intermediate region. We investigated the\nmonotonously growing potentials and a potential with a false vacuum. For the\nmonotonous potentials no negative modes are found about the Hawking-Turok\ninstanton. For a potential with the false vacuum the HT instanton is shown to\nhave a negative mode for certain initial data.\n", "  The capture or scattering of an initially straight infinite test cosmic\nstring by a Kerr-Newman black hole, or by any other small source of an\nelectrovac gravitational field, is analyzed analytically when the string moves\nwith initial velocity v and large impact parameter b >> M so that the string\nstays very nearly straight (except during the final capture process, if that\noccurs, or except far behind the gravitating object, if b is not much greater\nthan the energy of the object in the frame of the string). The critical impact\nparameter for capture at low velocities is shown to be\n[(pi/2)(M^2-Q^2)/v]^{1/2}. For all larger b, the displacement of the string\nfrom the plane of the gravitating object after the scattering approaches the\nfinal value [b^2 - (pi/2)(M^2-Q^2)/v]^{1/2} - 2 pi M v/(1-v^2)^{1/2}, for any\nv, so long as b >> M.\n", "  A new interpretation of entanglement entropy is proposed: entanglement\nentropy of a pure state with respect to a division of a Hilbert space into two\nsubspaces 1 and 2 is an amount of information, which can be transmitted through\n1 and 2 from a system interacting with 1 to another system interacting with 2.\nThe transmission medium is quantum entanglement between 1 and 2. In order to\nsupport the interpretation, suggestive arguments are given: variational\nprinciples in entanglement thermodynamics and quantum teleportation. It is\nshown that a quantum state having maximal entanglement entropy plays an\nimportant role in quantum teleportation. Hence, the entanglement entropy is, in\nsome sense, an index of efficiency of quantum teleportation. Finally,\nimplications for the information loss problem and Hawking radiation are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We examine here the nature of the central singularity forming in the\nspherically symmetric collapse of a dust cloud and it is shown that this is\nalways a strong curvature singularity where gravitational tidal forces diverge\npowerfully. An important consequence is that the nature of the naked\nsingularity forming in the dust collapse turns out to be stable against the\nperturbations in the initial data from which the collapse commences.\n", "  We find a number of complex solutions of the Einstein equations in the\nso-called unimodular version of general relativity, and we interpret them as\nsaddle points yielding estimates of a gravitational path integral over a space\nof almost everywhere Lorentzian metrics on a spacetime manifold with topology\nof the \"no-boundary\" type. In this setting, the compatibility of the\nno-boundary initial condition with the definability of the quantum measure\nreduces reduces to the normalizability and unitary evolution of the no-boundary\nwave function \\psi. We consider the spacetime topologies R^4 and RP^4 # R^4\nwithin a Taub minisuperspace model with spatial topology S^3, and the spacetime\ntopology R^2 x T^2 within a Bianchi type I minisuperspace model with spatial\ntopology T^3. In each case there exists exactly one complex saddle point (or\ncombination of saddle points) that yields a wave function compatible with\nnormalizability and unitary evolution. The existence of such saddle points\ntends to bear out the suggestion that the unimodular theory is less divergent\nthan traditional Einstein gravity. In the Bianchi type I case, the\ndistinguished complex solution is approximately real and Lorentzian at late\ntimes, and appears to describe an explosive expansion from zero size at T=0.\n(In the Taub cases, in contrast, the only complex solution with nearly\nLorentzian late-time behavior yields a wave function that is normalizable but\nevolves nonunitarily, with the total probability increasing exponentially in\nthe unimodular \"time\" in a manner that suggests a continuous creation of new\nuniverses at zero volume.) The issue of the stability of these results upon the\ninclusion of more degrees of freedom is raised.\n", "  The brick-wall model seeks to explain the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy as a\nwall-contribution to the thermal energy of ambient quantum fields raised to the\nHawking temperature. Reservations have been expressed concerning the\nself-consistency of this model. For example, it predicts large thermal energy\ndensities near the wall, producing a substantial mass-correction and,\npresumably, a large gravitational back-reaction. We re-examine this model and\nconclude that these reservations are unfounded once the ground state---the\nBoulware state---is correctly identified. We argue that the brick-wall model\nand the Gibbons-Hawking instanton (which ascribes a topological origin to the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy) are mutually exclusive, alternative descriptions\n(complementary in the sense of Bohr) of the same physics.\n", "  We solve Einstein equations coupled to a complex scalar field with infinitely\nlarge self-interaction, degenerate fermions, and a negative cosmological\nconstant in $(2+1)$ dimensions. Exact solutions for static boson-fermion stars\nare found when circular symmetry is assumed. We find that the minimum binding\nenergy of boson-fermion star takes a negative value if the value of the\ncosmological constant is sufficiently small.\n", "  Spacetime foam can be modeled in terms of nonlocal effective interactions in\na classical nonfluctuating background. Then, the density matrix for the\nlow-energy fields evolves, in the weak-coupling approximation, according to a\nmaster equation that contains a diffusion term. Furthermore, it is argued that\nspacetime foam behaves as a quantum thermal field that, apart from inducing\nloss of coherence, gives rise to effects such as gravitational Lamb and Stark\nshifts as well as quantum damping in the evolution of the low-energy\nobservables. These effects can be, at least in principle, experimentally\ntested.\n", "  We examine ways to write the Choptuik critical solution as the evolution of\nscale invariant variables. It is shown that a system of scale invariant\nvariables proposed by one of the authors does not evolve periodically in the\nChoptuik critical solution. We find a different system, based on maximal\nslicing. This system does evolve periodically, and may generalize to the case\nof axisymmetry or of no symmetry at all.\n", "  We show that a gap exists in the allowed sizes of all zero temperature static\nspherically symmetric black holes in semiclassical gravity when only\nconformally invariant fields are present. The result holds for both charged and\nuncharged black holes. By size we mean the proper area of the event horizon.\nThe range of sizes that do not occur depends on the numbers and types of\nquantized fields that are present. We also derive some general properties that\nboth zero and nonzero temperature black holes have in all classical and\nsemiclassical metric theories of gravity.\n", "  We present further evidence that the second post-Newtonian (pN) approximation\nto the gravitational waves emitted by inspiraling compact binaries is\nsufficient for the detection of these systems. This is established by comparing\nthe 2-pN wave forms to signals calculated from black hole perturbation theory.\nResults are presented for different detector noise curves. We also discuss the\nvalidity of this type of analysis.\n", "  We study a general field theory of a scalar field coupled to gravity through\na quadratic Gauss-Bonnet term $\\xi(\\phi) R^2_{GB}$. The coupling function has\nthe form $\\xi(\\phi)=\\phi^n$, where $n$ is a positive integer. In the absence of\nthe Gauss-Bonnet term, the cosmological solutions for an empty universe and a\nuniverse dominated by the energy-momentum tensor of a scalar field are always\ncharacterized by the occurrence of a true cosmological singularity. By\nemploying analytical and numerical methods, we show that, in the presence of\nthe quadratic Gauss-Bonnet term, for the dual case of even $n$, the set of\nsolutions of the classical equations of motion in a curved FRW background\nincludes singularity-free cosmological solutions. The singular solutions are\nshown to be confined in a part of the phase space of the theory allowing the\nnon-singular solutions to fill the rest of the space. We conjecture that the\nsame theory with a general coupling function that satisfies certain criteria\nmay lead to non-singular cosmological solutions.\n", "  We show that the response rate of (i) a static source interacting with\nHawking radiation of massless scalar field in Schwarzschild spacetime (with the\nUnruh vacuum) and that of (ii) a uniformly accelerated source with the same\nproper acceleration in Minkowski spacetime (with the Minkowski vacuum) are\nequal. We show that this equality will not hold if the Unruh vacuum is replaced\nby the Hartle-Hawking vacuum. It is verified that the source responds to the\nHawking radiation near the horizon as if it were at rest in a thermal bath in\nMinkowski spacetime with the same temperature. It is also verified that the\nresponse rate in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum approaches that in Minkowski\nspacetime with the same temperature far away from the black hole. Finally, we\ncompare our results with others in the literature.\n", "  We construct the operator that projects on the physical states in loop\nquantum gravity. To this aim, we consider a diffeomorphism invariant functional\nintegral over scalar functions. The construction defines a covariant,\nFeynman-like, spacetime formalism for quantum gravity and relates this theory\nto the spin foam models. We also discuss how expectation values of physical\nquantity can be computed.\n", "  Non stationary cylindrically symmetric exact solutions of the\nEinstein-Maxwell equations are derived as single soliton perturbations of a\nLevi-Civita metric, by an application of Alekseev inverse scattering method. We\nshow that the metric derived by L. Witten, interpreted as describing the\nelectrogravitational field of a straight, stationary, conducting wire may be\nrecovered in the limit of a `wide' soliton. This leads to the possibility of\ninterpreting the solitonic solutions as representing a non stationary\nelectrogravitational field exterior to, and interacting with, a thin, straight,\nsuperconducting cosmic string. We give a detailed discussion of the\nrestrictions that arise when appropiate energy and regularity conditions are\nimposed on the matter and fields comprising the string, considered as `source',\nthe most important being that this `source' must necessarily have a non-\nvanishing minimum radius. We show that as a consequence, it is not possible,\nexcept in the stationary case, to assign uniquely a current to the source from\na knowledge of the electrogravitational fields outside the source. A discussion\nof the asymptotic properties of the metrics, the physical meaning of their\ncurvature singularities, as well as that of some of the metric parameters, is\nalso included.\n", "  The renormalized expectation value of the stress energy tensor of the\nconformally invariant massless fields in the Unruh state in the Schwarzschild\nspacetime is constructed. It is achieved through solving the conservation\nequation in conformal space and utilizing the regularity conditions in the\nphysical metric. The relations of obtained results to the existing\napproximations are analysed.\n", "  We show that, contrary to a widespread belief, one can overcharge a near\nextremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole by throwing in a charged particle, as\nlong as the backreaction effects may be considered negligible. Furthermore, we\nfind that we can make the particle's classical radius, mass, and charge, as\nwell as the relative size of the backreaction terms arbitrarily small, by\nadjusting the parameters corresponding to the particle appropriately. This\nsuggests that the question of cosmic censorship is still not wholly resolved\neven in this simple scenario. We contrast this with attempting to overcharge a\nblack hole with a charged imploding shell, where we find that cosmic censorship\nis upheld. We also briefly comment on a number of possible extensions.\n", "  The density perturbation during inflation seeds the large scale structure. We\nconsider both new inflation-type and chaotic inflation-type potentials in the\nframework of Einstein-Brans-Dicke gravity. The density perturbation gives\nstrong constraints on the parameters in these potentials. For both potentials,\nthe constraints are not much different from those obtained in the original\ninflationary models by using of Einstein gravity.\n", "  The possibility of trapped modes of gravitational waves appearing in stars\nwith R>3M is considered. It is shown that the restriction to R<3M in previous\nstudies of trapped modes, using uniform density models, is not essential.\nScattering potentials are computed for another family of analytic stellar\nmodels showing the appearance of a deep potential well for one model with R>3M.\nHowever, the provided example is unstable, although it has a more realistic\nequation of state in the sense that the sound velocity is finite. On the other\nhand it is also shown that for some stable models belonging to the same family\nbut having R<3M, the well is significantly deeper than that of the uniform\ndensity stars. Whether there are physically realistic equations of state which\nallow stable configurations with trapped modes therefore remains an open\nproblem.\n", "  We describe the null geometry of a multiple black hole event horizon in terms\nof a conformal rescaling of a flat space null hypersurface. For the prolate\nspheroidal case, we show that the method reproduces the pair-of-pants shaped\nhorizon found in the numerical simulation of the head-on-collision of black\nholes. For the oblate case, it reproduces the initially toroidal event horizon\nfound in the numerical simulation of collapse of a rotating cluster. The\nanalytic nature of the approach makes further conclusions possible, such as a\nbearing on the hoop conjecture. From a time reversed point of view, the\napproach yields a description of the past event horizon of a fissioning white\nhole, which can be used as null data for the characteristic evolution of the\nexterior space-time.\n", "  The first law of black hole mechanics was derived by Wald in a general\ncovariant theory of gravity for stationary variations around a stationary black\nhole. It is formulated in terms of Noether charges, and has many advantages. In\nthis paper several issues are discussed to strengthen the validity of the\nNoether charge form of the first law. In particular, a gauge condition used in\nthe derivation is justified. After that, we justify the generalization to\nnon-stationary variations done by Iyer-Wald.\n", "  Consider the definition E of quasilocal energy stemming from the\nHamilton-Jacobi method as applied to the canonical form of the gravitational\naction. We examine E in the standard \"small-sphere limit,\" first considered by\nHorowitz and Schmidt in their examination of Hawking's quasilocal mass. By the\nterm \"small sphere\" we mean a cut S(r), level in an affine radius r, of the\nlightcone belonging to a generic spacetime point. As a power series in r, we\ncompute the energy E of the gravitational and matter fields on a spacelike\nhypersurface spanning S(r). Much of our analysis concerns conceptual and\ntechnical issues associated with assigning the zero-point of the energy. For\nthe small-sphere limit, we argue that the correct zero-point is obtained via a\n\"lightcone reference,\" which stems from a certain isometric embedding of S(r)\ninto a genuine lightcone of Minkowski spacetime. Choosing this zero-point, we\nfind agreement with Hawking's quasilocal mass expression, up to and including\nthe first non-trivial order in the affine radius. The vacuum limit relates the\nquasilocal energy directly to the Bel-Robinson tensor.\n", "  We classify the possible shapes of cosmic string cusps and how they transform\nunder Lorentz boosts. A generic cusp can be brought into a form in which the\nmotion of the cusp tip lies in the plane of the cusp. The cusp whose motion is\nperpendicular to this plane, considered by some authors, is a special case and\nnot the generic situation.\n  We redo the calculation of the energy in the region where the string overlaps\nitself near a cusp, which is the maximum energy that can be released in\nradiation. We take into account the motion of a generic cusp and the resulting\nLorentz contraction of the string core. The result is that the energy scales as\n$\\sqrt {rL}$ instead of the usual value of $r^{1/3} L^{2/3}$, where $r$ is the\nstring radius and $L$ and is the typical length scale of the string. Since $r\n<< L $ for cosmological strings, the radiation is strongly suppressed and could\nnot be observed.\n", "  One of the main results in canonical quantum gravity is the introduction of\nspin network states as a basis on the space of kinematical states. To arrive at\nthe physical state space of the theory though we need to understand the\ndynamics of the quantum gravitational states. To this aim we study a model in\nwhich we allow for the spins, labeling the edges of spin networks, to change\naccording to simple rules. The gauge invariance of the theory, restricting the\npossible values for the spins, induces propagating modes of spin changes. We\ninvestigate these modes under various assumptions about the parameters of the\nmodel.\n", "  It has been recently shown that topological defects can arise in symmetry\nbreaking models where the scalar field potential $V(\\phi)$ has no minima and is\na monotonically decreasing function of $|\\phi|$. Here we study the\ngravitational fields produced by such vacuumless defects in the cases of both\nglobal and gauge symmetry breaking. We find that a global monopole has a\nstrongly repulsive gravitational field, and its spacetime has an event horizon\nsimilar to that in de Sitter space. A gauge monopole spacetime is essentially\nthat of a magnetically charged black hole. The gravitational field of a global\nstring is repulsive and that of a gauge string is attractive at small distances\nand repulsive at large distances. Both gauge and global string spacetimes have\nsingularities at a finite distance from the string core.\n", "  This paper studies the non-spherical perturbations of the continuously\nself-similar critical solution of the gravitational collapse of a massless\nscalar field (the Roberts solution). The exact analysis of the perturbation\nequations reveals that there are no growing non-spherical perturbation modes.\n", "  We investigate higher than the first order gravitational perturbations in the\nNewman-Penrose formalism. Equations for the Weyl scalar $\\psi_4,$ representing\noutgoing gravitational radiation, can be uncoupled into a single wave equation\nto any perturbative order. For second order perturbations about a Kerr black\nhole, we prove the existence of a first and second order gauge (coordinates)\nand tetrad invariant waveform, $\\psi_I$, by explicit construction. This\nwaveform is formed by the second order piece of $\\psi_4$ plus a term, quadratic\nin first order perturbations, chosen to make $\\psi_I$ totally invariant and to\nhave the appropriate behavior in an asymptotically flat gauge. $\\psi_I$\nfulfills a single wave equation of the form ${\\cal T}\\psi_I=S,$ where ${\\cal\nT}$ is the same wave operator as for first order perturbations and $S$ is a\nsource term build up out of (known to this level) first order perturbations. We\ndiscuss the issues of imposition of initial data to this equation, computation\nof the energy and momentum radiated and wave extraction for direct comparison\nwith full numerical approaches to solve Einstein equations.\n", "  According to previous work, topological defects expand exponentially without\nan end if the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field is of the order of\nthe Planck mass. We extend the study of inflating topological defects to the\nBrans-Dicke gravity. With the help of numerical simulation we investigate the\ndynamics and spacetime structure of a global monopole. Contrary to the case of\nthe Einstein gravity, any inflating monopole eventually shrinks and takes a\nstable configuration. We also discuss cosmological constraints on the model\nparameters.\n", "  The Bohm-de Broglie interpretation of quantum mechanics is applied to\ncanonical quantum cosmology. It is shown that, irrespective of any\nregularization or choice of factor ordering of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, the\nunique relevant quantum effect which does not break spacetime is the change of\nits signature from lorentzian to euclidean. The other quantum effects are\neither trivial or break the four-geometry of spacetime. A Bohm-de Broglie\npicture of a quantum geometrodynamics is constructed, which allows the\ninvestigation of these latter structures. For instance, it is shown that any\nreal solution of the Wheeler-De Witt equation yields a generate four-geometry\ncompatible with the strong gravity limit of General Relativity and the Carroll\ngroup. Due to the more detailed description of quantum geometrodynamics given\nby the Bohm-de Broglie interpretation, some new boundary conditions on\nsolutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation must be imposed in order to preserve\nconsistency of this finer view.\n", "  Certain exotic phenomena in general relativity, such as backward time travel,\nappear to require the presence of matter with negative energy. While quantum\nfields are a possible source of negative energy densities, there are lower\nbounds - known as quantum inequalities - that constrain their duration and\nmagnitude. In this paper, we derive new quantum inequalities for scalar fields\nin static space-times, as measured by static observers with a choice of\nsampling function. Unlike those previously derived by Pfenning and Ford, our\nresults do not assume any specific sampling function. We then calculate these\nbounds in static three- and four-dimensional Robertson-Walker universes, the de\nSitter universe, and the Schwarzschild black hole. In each case, the new\ninequality is stronger than that of Pfenning and Ford for their particular\nchoice of sampling function.\n", "  The geometry of two infinitely long lines of mass moving in a fixed circular\norbit is considered as a toy model for the inspiral of a binary system of\ncompact objects due to gravitational radiation. The two Killing fields in the\ntoy model are used, according to a formalism introduced by Geroch, to describe\nthe geometry entirely in terms of a set of tensor fields on the two-manifold of\nKilling vector orbits. Geroch's derivation of the Einstein equations in this\nformalism is streamlined and generalized. The explicit Einstein equations for\nthe toy model spacetime are derived in terms of the degrees of freedom which\nremain after a particular choice of gauge.\n", "  We analyse when and why unitarity violations might occur in quantum cosmology\nrestricted to minisuperspace. To this end we discuss in detail backscattering\ntransitions between expanding and contracting solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt\nequation. We first show that upon neglecting only backscattering, one obtains\nan intermediate regime in which matter evolves unitarily but which does not\ncorrespond to any Schr\\\"odinger equation in a given geometry since\ngravitational backreaction effects are taken into account at the quantum level.\nWe then show that backscattering amplitudes are exponentially smaller than\nmatter transition amplitudes. Both results follow from an adiabatic treatment\nvalid for macroscopic universes. To understand how backscattering and the\nintermediate regime should be interpreted, we review the problem of electronic\ntransitions induced by nuclear motion since it is mathematically very similar.\nIn this problem, transition amplitudes are obtained from the conserved current.\nThe same applies to quantum cosmology and shows that the unique consistent\ninterpretation is based on the current when backscattering is neglected. We\nthen review why, in a relativistic context, backscattering is interpreted as\npair production whereas it is not in the non relativistic case. In each example\nthe correct interpretation is obtained by coupling the system to an external\nquantum device. From the absence of such external systems in cosmology, we\nconclude that backscattering does not have a unique consistent interpretation\nin quantum cosmology.\n", "  I present here a new algorithm to generate families of inhomogeneous massless\nscalar field cosmologies. New spacetimes, having a single isometry, are\ngenerated by breaking the homogeneity of massless scalar field $G_2$ models\nalong one direction. As an illustration of the technique I construct\ncosmological models which in their late time limit represent perturbations in\nthe form of gravitational and scalar waves propagating on a non-static\ninhomogeneous background. Several features of the obtained metrics are\ndiscussed, such as their early and late time limits, structure of singularities\nand physical interpretation.\n", "  In a gedanken experiment in which a box initially containing energy $E$ and\nentropy $S$ is lowered toward a black hole and then dropped in, it was shown by\nUnruh and Wald that the generalized second law of black hole thermodynamics\nholds, without the need to assume any bounds on $S$ other than the bound that\narises from the fact that entropy at a given energy and volume is bounded by\nthat of unconstrained thermal matter. The original analysis by Unruh and Wald\nmade the approximation that the box was ``thin'', but they later generalized\ntheir analysis to thick boxes (in the context of a slightly different process).\nNevertheless, Bekenstein has argued that, for a certain class of thick boxes,\nthe buoyancy force of the ``thermal atmosphere'' of the black hole is\nnegligible, and that his previously postulated bound on $S/E$ is necessary for\nthe validity of the generalized second law. In arguing for these conclusions,\nBekenstein made some assumptions about the nature of unconstrained thermal\nmatter and the location of the ``floating point'' of the box. We show here that\nunder these assumptions, Bekenstein's bound on $S/E$ follows automatically from\nthe fact that $S$ is bounded by the entropy of unconstrained thermal matter.\nThus, a box of matter which violates Bekenstein's bound would violate the\nassumptions made in his analysis, rather than violate the generalized second\nlaw. Indeed, we prove here that no universal entropy bound need be hypothesized\nin order to ensure the validity of the generalized second law in this process.\n", "  Although quantum field theory allows local negative energy densities and\nfluxes, it also places severe restrictions upon the magnitude and extent of the\nnegative energy. The restrictions take the form of quantum inequalities. These\ninequalities imply that a pulse of negative energy must not only be followed by\na compensating pulse of positive energy, but that the temporal separation\nbetween the pulses is inversely proportional to their amplitude. In an earlier\npaper we conjectured that there is a further constraint upon a negative and\npositive energy delta-function pulse pair. This conjecture (the quantum\ninterest conjecture) states that a positive energy pulse must overcompensate\nthe negative energy pulse by an amount which is a monotonically increasing\nfunction of the pulse separation. In the present paper we prove the conjecture\nfor massless quantized scalar fields in two and four-dimensional flat\nspacetime, and show that it is implied by the quantum inequalities.\n", "  It is shown that during expanding phases of flat homogeneous cosmologies all\nsmall enough non-linear perturbations decay exponentially. This result holds\nfor a large class of perfect fluid equations of state, but notably not for very\n``stiff'' fluids as the pure radiation case.\n", "  The stochastic approach to inflation suffers from ambiguities due to the\narbitrary choice of the time variable and due to the choice of the factor\nordering in the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation. Here it is shown that\nboth ambiguities can be removed if we require that the factor ordering should\nbe set in such a way that physical results are invariant with respect to time\nreparametrizations. This requirement uniquely selects the so-called Ito factor\nordering. Additional ambiguities associated with non-trivial kinetic terms of\nthe scalar fields are also discussed, as well as ways of constraining these\nambiguities.\n", "  Covariant equations characterizing the strength of a singularity in spherical\nsymmetry are derived and several models are investigated. The difference\nbetween central and non-central singularities is emphasised. A slight\nmodification to the definition of singularity strength is suggested. The\ngravitational weakness of shell crossing singularities in collapsing spherical\ndust is proven for timelike geodesics, closing a gap in the proof.\n", "  Techniques are developed here for evaluating the r-modes of rotating neutron\nstars through second order in the angular velocity of the star. Second-order\ncorrections to the frequencies and eigenfunctions for these modes are evaluated\nfor neutron star models. The second-order eigenfunctions for these modes are\ndetermined here by solving an unusual inhomogeneous hyperbolic boundary-value\nproblem. The numerical techniques developed to solve this unusual problem are\nsomewhat non-standard and may well be of interest beyond the particular\napplication here. The bulk-viscosity coupling to the r-modes, which appears\nfirst at second order, is evaluated. The bulk-viscosity timescales are found\nhere to be longer than previous estimates for normal neutron stars, but shorter\nthan previous estimates for strange stars. These new timescales do not\nsubstantially affect the current picture of the gravitational radiation driven\ninstability of the r-modes either for neutron stars or for strange stars.\n", "  Stability of the r-modes in rapidly rotating white dwarf stars is\ninvestigated. Improved estimates of the growth times of the\ngravitational-radiation driven instability in the r-modes of the observed DQ\nHer objects are found to be longer (probably considerably longer) than 6x10^9y.\nThis rules out the possibility that the r-modes in these objects are emitting\ngravitational radiation at levels that could be detectable by LISA. More\ngenerally it is shown that the r-mode instability can only be excited in a very\nsmall subset of very hot (T>10^6K), rather massive (M>0.9M_sun) and very\nrapidly rotating (P_min<P<1.2P_min) white dwarf stars. Further, the growth\ntimes of this instability are so long that these conditions must persist for a\nvery long time (t>10^9y) to allow the amplitude to grow to a dynamically\nsignificant level. This makes it extremely unlikely that the r-mode instability\nplays a significant role in any real white dwarf stars.\n", "  We extend the investigation of the gravitational collapse of a spherically\nsymmetric Yang-Mills field in Einstein gravity and show that, within the black\nhole regime, a new kind of critical behavior arises which separates black holes\nformed via Type I collapse from black holes formed through Type II collapse.\nFurther, we provide evidence that these new attracting critical solutions are\nin fact the previously discovered colored black holes with a single unstable\nmode.\n", "  We develop a close-limit approximation to the head-on collision of two\nneutron stars similar to that used to treat the merger of black hole binaries .\nThis approximation can serve as a useful benchmark test for future fully\nnonlinear studies. For neutron star binaries, the close-limit approximation\ninvolves assuming that the merged object can be approximated as a perturbed,\nstable neutron star during the ring-down phase of the coalescence. We introduce\na prescription for the construction of initial data sets, discuss the physical\nplausibility of the various assumptions involved, and briefly investigate the\ncharacter of the gravitational radiation produced during the merger. The\nnumerical results show that several of the merged objects fluid pulsation modes\nare excited to a significant level.\n", "  We calculate the flux from a spherical mirror which is expanding or\ncontracting with nearly uniform acceleration. We find that the flux at an\nexterior point (which could in principle be a functional of the mirror's past\nhistory) is actually found to be a local function, depending on the first and\nsecond time derivatives of acceleration at the retarded time.\n", "  The static cylindrically symmetric solutions of the gravitating Abelian Higgs\nmodel form a two parameter family. In this paper we give a complete\nclassification of the string-like solutions of this system. We show that the\nparameter plane is composed of two different regions with the following\ncharacteristics: One region contains the standard asymptotically conic cosmic\nstring solutions together with a second kind of solutions with Melvin-like\nasymptotic behavior. The other region contains two types of solutions with\nbounded radial extension. The border between the two regions is the curve of\nmaximal angular deficit of $2\\pi$.\n", "  We develop a framework for constructing initial data sets for perturbations\nabout spherically symmetric matter distributions. This framework facilitates\nsetting initial data representing astrophysical sources of gravitational\nradiation involving relativistic stars. The procedure is based on\nLichnerowicz-York's conformal approach to solve the constraints in Einstein's\nequations. The correspondence of these initial data sets in terms of the\nstandard gauge perturbation variables in the Regge-Wheeler perturbation\nvariables is established, and examples of initial data sets of merging neutron\nstars under the close-limit approximation are presented.\n", "  The quantum lightcone fluctuations in flat spacetimes with compactified\nspatial dimensions or with boundaries are examined. The discussion is based\nupon a model in which the source of the underlying metric fluctuations is taken\nto be quantized linear perturbations of the gravitational field. General\nexpressions are derived, in the transverse trace-free gauge, for the summation\nof graviton polarization tensors, and for vacuum graviton two-point functions.\nBecause of the fluctuating light cone, the flight time of photons between a\nsource and a detector may be either longer or shorter than the light\npropagation time in the background classical spacetime. We calculate the mean\ndeviations from the classical propagation time of photons due to the changes in\nthe topology of the flat spacetime. These deviations are in general larger in\nthe directions in which topology changes occur and are typically of the order\nof the Planck time, but they can get larger as the travel distance increases.\n", "  The fluctuations of the flux radiated by an evaporating black hole will be\ndiscussed. Two approaches to this problem will be adopted. In the first, the\nsquared flux operator is defined by normal ordering. In this case, both the\nmean flux and the mean squared flux are well defined local quantites. It is\nshown that the flux undergoes large fluctuations on a time scale of the order\nof the black hole's mass. Thus the semiclassical theory of gravity, in which a\nclassical gravitational field is coupled to the expectation value of the stress\ntensor, breaks down below this time scale. In the second approach, one does not\nattempt to give meaning to the squared flux as a local quantity, but only as a\ntime-averaged quantity. In both approaches, the mean squared mass minus the\nsquare of the mean mass grows linearly in time, but four times as fast in the\nsecond approach as in the first.\n", "  We study charged boson stars in scalar-tensor (ST) gravitational theories. We\nanalyse the weak field limit of the solutions and analytically show that there\nis a maximum charge to mass ratio for the bosons above which the weak field\nsolutions are not stable. This charge limit can be greater than the GR limit\nfor a wide class of ST theories. We numerically investigate strong field\nsolutions in both the Brans Dicke and power law ST theories. We find that the\ncharge limit decreases with increasing central boson density. We discuss the\ngravitational evolution of charged and uncharged boson stars in a cosmological\nsetting and show how, at any point in its evolution, the physical properties of\nthe star may be calculated by a rescaling of a solution whose asymptotic value\nof the scalar field is equal to its initial asymptotic value. We focus on\nevolution in which the particle number of the star is conserved and we find\nthat the energy and central density of the star decreases as the cosmological\ntime increases. We also analyse the appearance of the scalarization phenomenon\nrecently discovered for neutron stars configurations and, finally, we give a\nshort discussion on how making the correct choice of mass influences the\nargument over which conformal frame, the Einstein frame or the Jordan frame, is\nphysical.\n", "  We consider a string-inspired, gravitational theory of scalar and\nelectromagnetic fields and we investigate the existence of axially-symmetric,\nG\\\"{o}del-type cosmological solutions. The neutral case is studied first and an\n\"extreme\" G\\\"{o}del-type rotating solution, that respects the causality, is\ndetermined. The charged case is considered next and two new configurations for\nthe, minimally-coupled to gravity, electromagnetic field are presented. Another\nconfiguration motivated by the expected distribution of currents and charges in\na rotating universe is studied and shown to lead to a G\\\"{o}del-type solution\nfor a space-dependent coupling function. Finally, we investigate the existence\nof G\\\"{o}del-type cosmological solutions in the framework of the one-loop\ncorrected superstring effective action and we determine the sole configuration\nof the electromagnetic field that leads to such a solution. It turns out that,\nin all the charged cases considered, Closed Timelike Curves do appear and the\ncausality is always violated.\n", "  We study event horizons of non-axisymmetric black holes and show how features\nfound in axisymmetric studies of colliding black holes and of toroidal black\nholes are non-generic and how new features emerge. Most of the details of black\nhole formation and black hole merger are known only in the axisymmetric case,\nin which numerical evolution has successfully produced dynamical space-times.\nThe work that is presented here uses a new approach to construct the geometry\nof the event horizon, not by locating it in a given spacetime, but by direct\nconstruction. In the axisymmetric case, our method produces the familiar\npair-of-pants structure found in previous numerical simulations of black hole\nmergers, as well as event horizons that go through a toroidal epoch as\ndiscovered in the collapse of rotating matter. The main purpose of this paper\nis to show how new - substantially different - features emerge in the\nnon-axisymmetric case. In particular, we show how black holes generically go\nthrough a toroidal phase before they become spherical, and how this fits\ntogether with the merger of black holes.\n", "  Numerical simulations are performed of the approach to the singularity in\nGowdy spacetimes on S2XS1XR. The behavior is similar to that of Gowdy\nspacetimes on T3XR. In particular, the singularity is asymptotically velocity\nterm dominated, except at isolated points where spiky features develop.\n", "  Grishchuk has shown that the stochastic background of gravitational waves\nproduced by an inflationary phase in the early Universe has an unusual\nproperty: it is not a stationary Gaussian random process. Due to squeezing, the\nphases of the different waves are correlated in a deterministic way, arising\nfrom the process of parametric amplification that created them. The resulting\nrandom process is Gaussian but non-stationary. This provides a unique signature\nthat could in principle distinguish a background created by inflation from\nstationary stochastic backgrounds created by other types of processes. We\naddress the question: could this signature be observed with a gravitational\nwave detector? Sadly, the answer appears to be \"no\": an experiment which could\ndistinguish the non-stationary behavior would have to last approximately the\nage of the Universe at the time of measurement. This rules out direct detection\nby ground and space based gravitational wave detectors, but not indirect\ndetections via the electromagnetic Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation\n(CMBR).\n", "  An improved method is given for the computation of the stress-energy tensor\nof a quantized scalar field using adiabatic regularization. The method works\nfor fields with arbitrary mass and curvature coupling in Robertson-Walker\nspacetimes and is particularly useful for spacetimes with compact spatial\nsections. For massless fields it yields an analytic approximation for the\nstress-energy tensor that is similar in nature to those obtained previously for\nmassless fields in static spacetimes.\n", "  We study analytically black holes pierced by a thin vortex in dilatonic\ngravity for an arbitrary coupling of the vortex to the dilaton in an arbitrary\nframe. We show that the horizon of the charged black hole supports the\nlong-range fields of the Nielsen-Olesen vortex that can be considered as black\nhole hair for both massive and massless dilatons. We also prove that extremal\nblack holes exhibit a flux expulsion phenomenon for a sufficiently thick\nvortex. We consider the gravitational back-reaction of the thin vortex on the\nspacetime geometry and dilaton, and discuss under what circumstances the vortex\ncan be used to smooth out the singularities in the dilatonic C-metrics. The\neffect of the vortex on the massless dilaton is to generate an additional\ndilaton flux across the horizon.\n", "  We introduce the Pad\\'e--Z$_2$ (PZ) stochastic estimator for calculating\ndeterminants and determinant ratios. The estimator is applied to the\ncalculation of fermion determinants from the two ends of the Hybrid Monte Carlo\ntrajectories with pseudofermions. Our results on the $8^3 \\times 12$ lattice\nwith Wilson action show that the statistical errors from the stochastic\nestimator can be reduced by more than an order of magnitude by employing an\nunbiased variational subtraction scheme which utilizes the off-diagonal\nmatrices from the hopping expansion. Having been able to reduce the error of\nthe determinant ratios to about 20 % with a relatively small number of noise\nvectors, this may become a feasible algorithm for simulating dynamical fermions\nin full QCD. We also discuss the application to the density of states in\nHamiltonian systems.\n", "  We report on a study of two-flavor finite-temperature chiral phase transition\nemploying the Kogut-Susskind quark action and the plaquette gluon action in\nlattice QCD for a lattice with $N_t=4$ temporal size. Hybrid R simulations of\n$10^4$ trajectories are made at quark masses of $m_q=0.075, 0.0375, 0.02, 0.01$\nin lattice units for the spatial sizes $8^3, 12^3$ and $16^3$. The spatial size\ndependence of various susceptibilities confirm the previous conclusion of the\nabsence of a phase transition down to $m_q=0.02$. At $m_q=0.01$ an increase of\nsusceptibilities is observed up to the largest volume $16^3$ explored in the\npresent work. We argue, however, that this increase is likely to be due to an\nartifact of too small a lattice size and it cannot be taken to be the evidence\nfor a first-order transition. Analysis of critical exponents estimated from the\nquark mass dependence of susceptibilities shows that they satisfy hyperscaling\nconsistent with a second-order transition located at $m_q=0$. The exponents\nobtained from larger lattice, however, deviate significantly from both those of\nO(2), which is the exact symmetry group of the Kogut-Susskind action at finite\nlattice spacing, and those of O(4) expected from an effective sigma model\nanalysis in the continuum limit.\n", "  We revisit the strong coupling limit of the Schwinger model on the lattice\nusing staggered fermions and the hamiltonian approach to lattice gauge\ntheories. Although staggered fermions have no continuous chiral symmetry, they\nposses a discrete axial invari ance which forbids fermion mass and which must\nbe broken in order for the lattice Schwinger model to exhibit the features of\nthe spectrum of the continuum theory. We show that this discrete symmetry is\nindeed broken spontaneously in the strong coupling li mit. Expanding around a\ngauge invariant ground state and carefully considering the normal ordering of\nthe charge operator, we derive an improved strong coupling expansion and\ncompute the masses of the low lying bosonic excitations as well as the chiral\nco ndensate of the model. We find very good agreement between our lattice\ncalculations and known continuum values for these quantities already in the\nfourth order of strong coupling perturbation theory. We also find the exact\nground state of the antiferromag netic Ising spin chain with long range Coulomb\ninteraction, which determines the nature of the ground state in the strong\ncoupling limit.\n", "  We discuss the physical picture of thick vortices as the mechanism\nresponsible for confinement at arbitrarily weak coupling in SU(2) gauge theory.\nBy introducing appropriate variables on the lattice we distinguish between\nthin, thick and `hybrid' vortices, the latter involving Z(2) monopole loop\nboundaries. We present numerical lattice simulation results that demonstrate\nthat the full SU(2) string tension at weak coupling arises from the presence of\nvortices linked to the Wilson loop. Conversely, excluding linked vortices\neliminates the confining potential. The numerical results are stable under\nalternate choice of lattice action as well as a smoothing procedure which\nremoves short distance fluctuations while preserving long distance physics.\n", "  We construct instanton-like classical solutions of the fixed point action of\na suitable renormalization group transformation for the SU(3) lattice gauge\ntheory. The problem of the non-existence of one-instantons on a lattice with\nperiodic boundary conditions is circumvented by working on open lattices. We\nconsider instanton solutions for values of the size (0.6-1.9 in lattice units)\nwhich are relevant when studying the SU(3) topology on coarse lattices using\nfixed point actions. We show how these instanton configurations on open\nlattices can be taken into account when determining a few-couplings\nparametrization of the fixed point action.\n", "  We show that the monopole currents which one obtains in the maximally Abelian\ngauge of SU(2) fall into two quite distinct classes (when the volume is large\nenough). In each field configuration there is precisely one cluster that\npermeates the whole lattice volume. It has a current density and a magnetic\nscreening mass that scale and it produces the whole of the string tension. The\nremaining clusters have a number density that follows an approximate power law\nproportional to the inverse cube of l where l is the length of the monopole\nworld line in lattice units. These clusters are localised in space-time with\nradii which vary as the square root of l. In terms of the radius r these\n`lumps' have a scale-invariant distribution proportional to (dr/r . 1/{r^4}).\nMoreover they appear not to contribute at all to the string tension. The fact\nthat they are scale-invariant at small distances would seem to rule out an\ninstanton origin.\n", "  The temporal component of the heavy-light axial vector current is constructed\nto one-loop order in perturbation theory and to order 1/M, where M is the heavy\nquark mass, in terms of operators suitable for use in lattice simulations of B\nand D mesons. The O(a)-improved clover action is used for the massless light\nquark, where a is the lattice spacing, and propagation of the heavy quark is\ndescribed by a nonrelativistic lattice action.\n", "  We investigate the topological structure of the vacuum in SU(3) lattice gauge\ntheory. We use under-relaxed cooling to remove the high-frequency fluctuations\nand a variety of \"filters\" to identify the topological charges in the resulting\nsmoothened field configurations. We find a densely packed vacuum with an\naverage instanton size, in the continuum limit, of about 0.5 fm. The density at\nlarge sizes decreases as a large inverse power of the size. At small sizes we\nsee some sign of a trend towards the asymptotic perturbative behaviour. We find\nthat an interesting polarisation phenomenon occurs: the large topological\ncharges tend to have, on the average, the same sign and are over-screened by\nthe smaller charges which tend to have, again on the average, the opposite sign\nto the larger instantons. We also calculate the topological susceptibility for\nwhich we obtain a continuum value of about 187 MeV. We perform the calculations\nfor various volumes, lattice spacings and numbers of cooling sweeps, so as to\nobtain some control over the associated systematic errors. The coupling range\nis from beta=6.0 to beta=6.4 and the lattice volumes range from 16x16x16x48 to\n32x32x32x64.\n", "  We study the gauge-fixing approach to the construction of lattice chiral\ngauge theories in one-loop weak-coupling perturbation theory. We show how\ninfrared properties of the gauge degrees of freedom determine the nature of the\ncontinuous phase transition at which we take the continuum limit. The fermion\nself-energy and the vacuum polarization are calculated, and confirm that, in\nthe abelian case, this approach can be used to put chiral gauge theories on the\nlattice in four dimensions. We comment on the generalization to the nonabelian\ncase.\n", "  A recently claimed resolution to the lattice Gribov problem in the context of\nchiral lattice gauge theories is examined. Unfortunately, I find that the old\nproblem remains.\n", "  The vacuum overlap formalism is extended to describe the supersymmetric\nmultiplet of a Weyl fermion, a complex scalar boson and an auxiliary field in\nthe case without interaction, based on the fact that supersymmetry can be\nmaintained upto quadratic terms by introducing bosonic species doublers. We\nalso obtain a local action which describes the chiral multiplet and discuss its\nsymmetry structure. It is shown that, besides the manifest supersymmetry, the\naction possesses a chiral symmetry of the type given by L\\\"uscher and analogous\nbosonic symmetries which may be regarded as independent infinitesimal rotations\nof complex phases of the scalar and the auxiliary fields. This implies that the\n$U(1) \\times U(1)_R$ symmetry of the chiral multiplet can be exact on the\nlattice.\n", "  Lattice QCD using fermions whose Dirac operator obeys the Ginsparg-Wilson\nrelation, is perhaps the best known formulation of QCD with a finite cutoff. It\nreproduces all the low energy QCD phenomenology associated with chiral symmetry\nat finite lattice spacings. In particular it explains the origin of massless\npions due to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and leads to new ways to\napproach the U(1) problem on the lattice. Here we show these results in the\npath integral formulation and derive for the first time in lattice QCD a known\nformal continuum relation between the chiral condensate and the topological\nsusceptibility. This relation leads to predictions for the critical behavior of\nthe topological susceptibility near the phase transition and can now be checked\nin Monte-Carlo simulations even at finite lattice spacings.\n", "  We investigate the phase structure of the two-dimensional lattice Gross-Neveu\nmodel formulated with the Wilson fermion action to leading order of 1/N\nexpansion. Structural change of the parity-broken phase under the influence of\nfinite temperature and chemical potential is studied. The connection between\nthe lattice phase structure and the chiral phase transition of the continuum\ntheory is clarified.\n", "  I construct a Lattice Gauge Theory (LGT) with discrete Z_2 structure group\nand an equivariant BRST symmetry that is physically equivalent to the standard\nSU(2)-LGT. The measure of this Z_2-LGT is invariant under all the discrete\nsymmetries of the lattice and its partition function does not vanish. The\nTopological Lattice Theories (TLT) that localize on the moduli spaces are\nexplicitly constructed and their BRST symmetry is exhibited. The ghosts of the\nZ_2-invariant local LGT are integrated in favor of a nonlocal bosonic measure.\nIn addition to the SU(2) link variables and the coupling g^2, this effective\nbosonic measure also depends on an auxiliary gauge invariant site variable of\ncanonical dimension two and on a gauge parameter \\alpha. The relation between\nthe expectation value of the auxiliary field, the gauge parameter \\alpha and\nthe lattice spacing $a$ is obtained to lowest order in the loop expansion. In\nfour dimensions and the critical limit this expectation value is a physical\nscale proportional to \\Lambda_L in the gauge \\alpha=g^2 (11-n_f)/24+ O(g^4).\nImplications for the loop expansion of observables in such a critical gauge are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We study a Yukawa theory with spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and with a\nlarge number N of fermions near the finite temperature phase transition.\nCritical properties in such a system can be described by the mean field theory\nvery close to the transition point. We show that the width of the region where\nnon-trivial critical behavior sets in is suppressed by a certain power of 1/N.\nOur Monte Carlo simulations confirm these analytical results. We discuss\nimplications for the chiral phase transition in QCD.\n", "  We use one-loop chiral perturbation theory to compare potential lattice\ncomputations of the K+ --> pi+ pi0 decay amplitude at m_K=2m_pi with the\nexperimental value. We find that the combined one-loop effect due to this\nunphysical pion to kaon mass ratio and typical finite volume effects is still\nof order minus 20-30%, and appears to dominate the effects from quenching.\n", "  Random Matrix Theory (RMT) is a powerful statistical tool to model spectral\nfluctuations. This approach has also found fruitful application in Quantum\nChromodynamics (QCD). Importantly, RMT provides very efficient means to\nseparate different scales in the spectral fluctuations. We try to identify the\nequivalent of a Thouless energy in complete spectra of the QCD Dirac operator\nfor staggered fermions from SU(2) lattice gauge theory for different lattice\nsize and gauge couplings. In disordered systems, the Thouless energy sets the\nuniversal scale for which RMT applies. This relates to recent theoretical\nstudies which suggest a strong analogy between QCD and disordered systems. The\nwealth of data allows us to analyze several statistical measures in the bulk of\nthe spectrum with high quality. We find deviations which allows us to give an\nestimate for this universal scale. Other deviations than these are seen whose\npossible origin is discussed. Moreover, we work out higher order correlators as\nwell, in particular three--point correlation functions.\n", "  We introduce a new class of actions for staggered quarks in lattice QCD which\nsignificantly reduce flavour symmetry violations in the pion mass spectrum. An\naction introduced by the MILC collaboration for the same purpose is seen to be\na special case. We discus how such actions arise from a systematic attempt to\nreduce flavour symmetry violations in the weak coupling limit. It is shown that\nfor quenched lattice QCD at 6/g^2=5.7, representative actions of this class\ngive a considerable reduction in flavour symmetry violation over the standard\nstaggered action, and a significant reduction over what is achieved by the MILC\naction.\n", "  Analytic methods for Abelian projection are developed. A number of results\nare obtained related to string tension measurements. It is proven that even\nwithout gauge fixing, abelian projection yields string tensions of the\nunderlying non-Abelian theory. Strong arguments are given for similar results\nin the case where gauge fixing is employed. The methods used emphasize that the\nprojected theory is derived from the underlying non-Abelian theory rather than\nvice versa. In general, the choice of subgroup used for projection is not very\nimportant, and need not be Abelian. While gauge fixing is shown to be in\nprinciple unnecessary for the success of Abelian projection, it is\ncomputationally advantageous for the same reasons that improved operators,\ne.g., the use of fat links, are advantageous in Wilson loop measurements. Two\nother issues, Casimir scaling and the conflict between projection and critical\nuniversality, are also discussed.\n", "  We present the final analysis of the light and strange hadron spectra from a\nfull QCD lattice simulation with two degenerate dynamical sea quark flavours at\n$\\beta = 5.6$ on a $16^3 \\times 32$ lattice. Four sets of sea quark masses\ncorresponding to the range $.69 \\leq m_\\pi/m_\\rho \\leq .83$ are investigated.\n  For reference we also ran a quenched simulation at $\\beta_{\\sf eff} = 6.0$,\nwhich is the point of equal lattice spacing, $a_{\\rho}^{-1}$. In the light\nsector, we find the chiral extrapolation to physical u- and d- masses to\npresent a major source of uncertainty, comparable to the expected size of\nunquenching effects. From linear and quadratic fits we can estimate the errors\non the hadron masses made from light quarks to be on a 15 % level prior to the\ncontinuum extrapolation. For the hadrons with strange valence quark content,\nthe $N_F = 2$ approximation to QCD appears not to cure the well-known failure\nof quenched QCD to reproduce the physical $K-K^*$ splitting.\n", "  We discuss a phase diagram for a relativistic SU(2) x U_{S}(1) lattice gauge\ntheory, with emphasis on the formation of a parity-invariant chiral condensate,\nin the case when the $U_{S}(1)$ field is infinitely coupled, and the SU(2)\nfield is moved away from infinite coupling by means of a strong-coupling\nexpansion. We provide analytical arguments on the existence of (and partially\nderive) a critical line in coupling space, separating the phase of broken SU(2)\nsymmetry from that where the symmetry is unbroken. We review uncoventional\n(Kosterlitz-Thouless type) superconducting properties of the model, upon\ncoupling it to external electromagnetic potentials. We discuss the r\\^ole of\ninstantons of the unbroken subgroup U(1) of SU(2), in eventually destroying\nsuperconductivity under certain circumstances. The model may have applications\nto the theory of high-temperature superconductivity. In particular, we argue\nthat in the regime of the couplings leading to the broken SU(2) phase, the\nmodel may provide an explanation on the appearance of a pseudo-gap phase, lying\nbetween the antiferromagnetic and the superconducting phases. In such a phase,\na fermion mass gap appears in the theory, but there is no phase coherence, due\nto the Kosterlitz-Thouless mode of symmetry breaking. The absence of\nsuperconductivity in this phase is attributed to non-perturbative effects\n(instantons) of the subgroup U(1) of SU(2).\n", "  We investigate four-dimensional compact U(1) lattice gauge theory with a\nmonopole term added to the Wilson action. First we consider the phase structure\nat negative $\\beta$, revealing some properties of a third phase region there,\nin particular the existence of a number of different states. Then our present\nstudies concentrate on larger values of the monopole coupling $\\lambda$ where\nthe confinement-Coulomb phase transition turns out to become of second order.\nPerforming a finite-size analysis we find that the critical exponent $\\nu$ is\nclose to, however, different from the gaussian value and that in the range\nconsidered $\\nu$ increases somewhat with $\\lambda$.\n", "  The inverse of the fermion matrix squared is used to define a transfer matrix\nfor domain-wall fermions. When the domain-wall height $M$ is bigger than one,\nthe transfer matrix is complex. Slowly suppressed chiral symmetry violations\nmay then arise from all eigenvalues of the transfer matrix which are located\nnear the unit circle. Using a variable lattice spacing for the fifth coordinate\nwe enforce the strict positivity of the transfer matrix for any $M$. We\nfurthermore propose a modified pseudo-fermion action, aimed to decrease the\ndensity of close-to-unity eigenvalues of the (positive) transfer matrix, at the\nprice of a small renormalization of the coupling constant. We explain why these\nchanges may reduce chiral symmetry violations in lattice QCD simulations.\n", "  We propose a strategy for conducting lattice QCD simulations at fixed volume\nbut variable quark mass so as to investigate the physical effects of dynamical\nfermions. We present details of techniques which enable this to be carried out\neffectively, namely the tuning in bare parameter space and efficient stochastic\nestimation of the fermion determinant. Preliminary results and tests of the\nmethod are presented. We discuss further possible applications of these\ntechniques.\n", "  We demonstrate that substantial progress can be achieved in the study of the\nphase structure of 4-dimensional compact QED by a joint use of hybrid Monte\nCarlo and multicanonical algorithms, through an efficient parallel\nimplementation. This is borne out by the observation of considerable speedup of\ntunnelling between the metastable states, close to the phase transition, on the\nWilson line. We estimate that the creation of adequate samples (with order 100\nflip-flops) becomes a matter of half a year's runtime at 2 Gflops sustained\nperformance for lattices of size up to 24^4.\n", "  We present results on a new operator for the investigation of string-breaking\neffects in quenched SU(2)-colour QCD. The ground state of a spatially-separated\nstatic-light meson-antimeson pair is a combination of a state with two distinct\nmesons, expected to dominate for large separations, and a state where the light\nquarks have annihilated, which contributes at short distances. The cross-over\nbetween these two regimes provides the string-breaking scale.\n", "  We study effective mass generation of off-diagonal gluons and infrared\nabelian dominance in the maximally abelian (MA) gauge. Using the SU(2) lattice\nQCD, we investigate the propagator and the effective mass of the gluon field in\nthe MA gauge with the U(1)$_3$ Landau gauge fixing. The Monte Carlo simulation\nis performed on the $12^3 \\times 24$ lattice with $2.2 \\le \\beta \\le 2.4$, and\nalso on the $16^4$ and $20^4$ lattices with $2.3 \\le \\beta \\le 2.4$. In the MA\ngauge, the diagonal gluon component $A_\\mu^3$ shows long-range propagation, and\ninfrared abelian dominance is found for the gluon propagator. In the MA gauge,\nthe off-diagonal gluon component $A_\\mu^\\pm$ behaves as a massive vector boson\nwith the effective mass $M_{\\rm off} \\simeq 1.2$ GeV in the region of $r \\gsim\n0.2$ fm, and its propagation is limited within short range. We conjecture that\ninfrared abelian dominance can be interpreted as infrared inactivity of the\noff-diagonal gluon due to its large mass generation induced by the MA gauge\nfixing.\n", "  We investigate the contribution of instantons to the eigenvalue spectrum of\nthe Dirac operator in quenched QCD. The instanton configurations that we use\nhave been derived, elsewhere, from cooled SU(3) lattice gauge fields and, for\ncomparison, we also analyse a random `gas' of instantons. Using a set of\nsimplifying approximations, we find a non-zero chiral condensate. However we\nalso find that the spectral density diverges for small eigenvalues, so that the\nchiral condensate, at zero quark mass, diverges in quenched QCD. The degree of\ndivergence decreases with the instanton density, so that it is negligible for\nthe smallest number of cooling sweeps but becomes substantial for larger number\nof cools. We show that the spectral density scales, that finite volume\ncorrections are small and we see evidence for the screening of topological\ncharges. However we also find that the spectral density and chiral condensate\nvary rapidly with the number of cooling sweeps -- unlike, for example, the\ntopological susceptibility. Whether the problem lies with the cooling or with\nthe identification of the topological charges is an open question. This problem\nneeds to be resolved before one can determine how important is the divergence\nwe have found for quenched QCD.\n", "  I show how to avoid a two level nested conjugate gradient procedure in the\ncontext of Hybrid Monte Carlo with the overlap fermionic action. The resulting\nprocedure is quite similar to Hybrid Monte Carlo with domain wall fermions, but\nis more flexible and therefore has some potential worth exploring.\n", "  The SO(3) lattice gauge theory with a Villain form of action was investigated\nby Monte Carlo techniques on asymmetric lattices with Nt = 2 and 4, where Nt is\nthe number of sites in the temporal extent. Unlike the results for higher Nt,\nonly one transition of second order was found for Nt = 2 . An extended action\nwith an irrelevant term to suppress Z_2 monopoles enabled us to get a better\nview of the deconfinement transition as the effects of bulk transition could be\nsuppressed as well. Although the action has no global Z_2 symmetry for the\nSO(3) theory, unlike the SU(2) theory at finite temperature, our study revealed\na second order deconfinement transition, with properties similar to the\ndeconfinement transition of SU(2).\n", "  The modelling of the ultraviolet contributions to the quark determinant in\nlattice QCD in terms of a small number of Wilson loops is examined. Complete\nDirac spectra are obtained for sizeable ensembles of SU(3) gauge fields at\n$\\beta$=5.7 on 6$^4$, 8$^4$, and 10$^4$ lattices allowing for the first time a\ndetailed study of the volume dependence of the effective loop action generating\nthe quark determinant. The connection to the hopping parameter expansion is\nexamined in the heavy quark limit. We compare the efficiency and accuracy of\nvarious methods- specifically, Lanczos versus stochastic approaches- for\nextracting the quark determinant on an ensemble of configurations.\n", "  A comparison is made of the (quenched) light hadron spectrum and of simple\nmatrix elements for a hypercubic fermion action (based on a fixed point action)\nand the clover action, both using fat links, at a lattice spacing a= 0.18 fm.\nRenormalization constants for the naive and improved vector current and the\nnaive axial current are computed using Ward identities. The renormalization\nfactors are very close to unity, and the spectroscopy of light hadrons and the\npseudoscalar and vector decay constants agree well with simulations at smaller\nlattice spacings (and with experiment).\n", "  The symmetry group of the staggered Fermion transfer matrix in a spatial\ndirection is constructed at finite temperature. Hadron-like operators carrying\nirreducible representations of this group are written down from the breaking of\nthe zero temperature group. Analysis of the correlators in a free fermion\ntheory suggests new measurements which can test current interpretations.\n", "  A general method of constructing the Dirac operator for a randomly\ntriangulated manifold is proposed. The fermion field and the spin connection\nlive, respectively, on the nodes and on the links of the corresponding dual\ngraph. The construction is carried out explicitly in 2-d, on an arbitrary\norientable manifold without boundary. It can be easily converted into a\ncomputer code. The equivalence, on a sphere, of Majorana fermions and Ising\nspins in 2-d is rederived. The method can, in principle, be extended to higher\ndimensions.\n", "  The cross section between a $c \\bar c$ pair and a nucleon is small and\nsensitive to the $c - \\bar c$ separation if the pair is in a color-singlet\nstate, but very large and insensitive to the separation if it is in a\ncolor-octet state. We use this property in an absorption model involving both\ncolor components to deduce the color structure of $c \\bar c$ pairs produced in\n$p(B)A \\to \\psi X$ reactions. Our analysis shows that the NA3, NA38 and E772\ndata are not inconsistent with the theoretical picture that color-octet and\ncolor-singlet precursors are produced in roughly equal proportions if the\nproduced color-singlet precursors are pointlike and transparent. However, if\nthe color-singlet precursors are not transparent but have a cross section of a\nfew mb, these data do show a definite preference for a larger fraction of\ncolor-singlet precursors. In either case, the color-octet fraction increases\nwith $x_F$, approaching unity as $x_F$ becomes large.\n", "  Particle creation during inflation is considered. It could be important for\nspecies whose interaction is of gravitational strength or weaker. A complete\nbut economical formalism is given for spin-zero and spin-half particles, and\nthe particle abundance is estimated on the assumption that the particle mass in\nthe early universe is of order the Hubble parameter $H$. It is roughly the same\nfor both spins, and it is argued that the same estimate should hold for higher\nspin particles in particular the gravitino. The abundance is bigger than that\nfrom the usual particle collision mechanism if the inflationary energy scale is\nof order $10^{16} GeV$, but not if it is much lower.\n", "  We calculated the polarization of \\psi' due to gg \\to Q\\bar{Q}[^3P_J^(8)]g\n\\to \\psi^\\lambda color-octet quarkonia production. We find that at low\ntransverse momenta the \\psi' is unpolarized due to the contributions\nproportional to the L=S=0 and L=S=1 color-octet matrix elements. As p_\\perp\nincreases, the \\psi' mesons become 100% polarized, as predicted by\nfragmentation calculations. Polarization due to lowest order color-singlet\nproduction is also considered, which qualitatively has a similar shape to the\ncolor-octet production.\n", "  In supersymmetric models with R-parity violation, scalar neutrinos may be\nproduced as s-channel resonances in e^+e^- colliders. We note that within\ncurrent constraints, the scalar neutrino may have a width of several GeV into\nb\\bar{b} and be produced with large cross section, leading to a novel\nsupersymmetry discovery signal at LEP II. In addition, if the scalar neutrino\nmass approximately equals m_Z, such a resonance necessarily increases R_b and\nreduces A_{FB}(b), significantly improving the fit to electroweak data. Bounds\nfrom B meson and top quark decays are leading constraints, and we stress the\nimportance of future measurements.\n", "  We analyse in detail the supersymmetric contributions to the decay of an\nextra Z boson in effective rank 5 models, including the important effect of\nD-terms on sfermion masses. The inclusion of supersymmetric decay channels will\nreduce the Z' branching ratio to standard model particles resulting in lower Z'\nmass limits than those often quoted. In particular, the supersymmetric\nparameter space motivated by the recent Fermilab $ee\\gamma\\gamma$ event and\nother suggestive evidence results in a branching fraction B(Z' -> e^+\ne^-)\\simeq 2-4%. The expected cross sections and branching ratios could give a\nfew events in the present data and we speculate on the connection to the three\ne^+e^- events observed at Fermilab with large dielectron invariant mass.\n", "  We examine the gauge dependence of lower bounds on the Higgs mass obtained\nfrom the requirement that the electroweak vacuum be the global minimum of the\neffective potential. We study a simple model, the spontaneously-broken Abelian\nHiggs model coupled to a chiral quark doublet in a two-parameter gauge and\ndemonstrate that the lower bounds on the Higgs mass obtained in this model are\ndependent on the choice of gauge parameters. We discuss the significance of\nthis result for calculations in the Standard Model.\n", "  The QED vacuum polarization function is calculated to O(alpha^2)\n(next-to-leading order) accuracy in the threshold regime by using the concept\nof effective field theories to resum diagrams with the instantaneous Coulomb\nexchange of longitudinally polarized photons. It is shown that the O(alpha^2)\ncontributions are of order alpha^2 in size rather than alpha^2/Pi^2. The vacuum\npolarization contributions to the O(alpha^6) hyperfine splitting of the\npositronium ground state are recalculated and differences with an older\ncalculation are pointed out. The results are used to determine O(C_F^2\nalpha_s^2) (next-to-next-to-leading order) Darwin corrections to heavy\nquark-antiquark bound state l=0 wave functions at the origin and to the heavy\nquark-antiquark production cross section in e^+e^- collisions in the threshold\nregion. The absolute value of the corrections amounts to 10%-20% and 17%-34% in\nthe modulus squared of the ground state wave functions at the origin for the\n$b\\bar b$ and $c\\bar c$ systems, respectively. In the case of the $t\\bar t$\nproduction cross section in the threshold region the absolute value of the\ncorrections is between 2% and 6% around the 1S peak and between 1% and 2% for\nhigher energies. A critical comment on recent QCD sum rule calculations for the\n$\\Upsilon$ system is made.\n", "  We present a detailed and complete calculation of the gluino and scalar\nquarks contribution to the flavour-changing top quark decay into a charm quark\nand a photon, gluon, or a Z boson within the minimal supersymmetric standard\nmodel including flavour changing gluino-quarks-scalar quarks couplings in the\nright-handed sector. We compare the results with the ones presented in an\nearlier paper where we considered flavour changing couplings only in the\nleft-handed sector. We show that these new couplings have important\nconsequences leading to a large enhancement when the mixing of the scalar\npartners of the left- and right-handed top quark is included. Furthermore CP\nviolation in the flavour changing top quark decay will occur when a SUSY phase\nis taken into account.\n", "  We present a detailed and complete calculation of the doubly charged Higgsino\ncontribution to the decays mu--> e photon and mu--> 3e and to the anomalous\nmagnetic moment of the muon within the left-right supersymmetric model. We\ninclude the mixing of the scalar partners of the left and right handed leptons,\nand show that it leads to a strong enhancement of the decay modes in certain\nscenarios. We find that the contribution of the doubly charged Higgsino can be\nclose to the known experimental values and are reachable by future experiments.\n", "  We study non-topological and CP-violating static wall solutions in the\nframework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. We show that such\nmembranes, characterized by a non-trivial winding of the relative $U(1)$ phase\nof the two Higgs fields in the direction orthogonal to the wall, exist for\nsmall values of the mass of the CP-odd Higgs boson when loop corrections to the\nHiggs potential are included. Although their present-day existence is excluded\nby experimental bounds, we argue why they may have existed in the early\nuniverse with important cosmological consequences.\n", "  We investigate in some detail consequences of the effective colour-dielectric\nformulation of lattice gauge theory using the light-cone Hamiltonian formalism\nwith a transverse lattice. As a quantitative test of this approach, we have\nperformed extensive analytic and numerical calculations for 2+1-dimensional\npure gauge theory in the large N limit. Because of Eguchi-Kawai reduction, one\neffectively studies a 1+1-dimensional gauge theory coupled to matter in the\nadjoint representation. We study the structure of coupling constant space for\nour effective potential by comparing with the physical results available from\nconventional Euclidean lattice Monte Carlo simulations of this system. In\nparticular, we calculate and measure the scaling behaviour of the entire\nlow-lying glueball spectrum, glueball wavefunctions, string tension, asymptotic\ndensity of states, and deconfining temperature. We employ a new hybrid\nDLCQ/wavefunction basis in our calculations of the light-cone Hamiltonian\nmatrix elements, along with extrapolation in Tamm-Dancoff truncation,\nsignificantly reducing numerical errors. Finally we discuss, in light of our\nresults, what further measurements and calculations could be made in order to\nsystematically remove lattice spacing dependence from our effective potential a\npriori.\n", "  The problem of defining a gauge invariant effective potential with a strict\nenergetic interpretation is examined in the context of spontaneously broken\ngauge theories. It is shown that such a potential can be defined in terms of a\ncomposite gauge invariant order parameter in physical gauges. This effective\npotential is computed through one loop order in a model with scalars and\nfermions coupled to an abelian gauge theory, which serves as a simple model of\nthe situation in electroweak theory, where vacuum stability arguments based on\nthe scalar effective potential have been used to place lower bounds on the\nHiggs mass.\n", "  Heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory is extended to include the effects of\nquenching. In this framework the leading nonanalytic dependence of the heavy\nbaryon masses on the light quark masses is studied. The size of quenching\neffects is estimated by comparing the results of quenched and ordinary chiral\nperturbation theories. It is found that in general they can be large. This\nestimate is relevant to lattice simulations of the heavy baryon masses.\n", "  We consider the maximal U(3) horizontal scheme as a handle on fermion masses\nand mixings. In particular, we attempt to explain the large top Yukawa coupling\nand the masses and mixing in the two heaviest generations. A simple model is\nconstructed by enlarging the matter content of the Standard Model with that of\na $10+\\bar{10}$ pair of SU(5). The third generation particles get their masses\nwhen U(3) is broken to U(2). Top quark mass is naturally of order one. Bottom\nand tau masses are suppressed because of a hierarchy in the effective Yukawa\ncouplings and not from the hierarchy in the Higgs doublet vacuum expectation\nvalues. The hierarchy is a consequence of the fact that the particle spectrum\ncontains an incomplete vector-like generation and can come from hierarchies\nbetween scales of breaking of different grand unified groups. Hierarchies and\nmixings between the second and third generation are obtained by introducing a\nsingle parameter epsilon' representing the breaking U(2) -> U(1). As a\nconsequence, we show that the successful (and previosuly obtained) relations\nV_{cb} \\approx (m_s / m_b) \\approx \\sqrt (m_c / m_t) easily follow from our\nscheme.\n", "  We consider long-baseline neutrino oscillations in the framework of two\nschemes with mixing of four massive neutrinos which can accommodate all the\nexisting indications in favour of neutrino mixing. Within these schemes, we\nderive bounds on the oscillation probabilities and the CP-odd\nneutrino-antineutrino asymmetries in long-baseline experiments. Using the\nresults of short-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, we obtain rather\nstrong upper bounds on the long-baseline probabilities 1-P(nu_e->nu_e) and\nP(nu_mu->nu_e). Nevertheless, the projected sensitivities of the MINOS and\nICARUS experiments are better than our bounds. We also show that there are no\ncorresponding constraints for nu_mu->nu_mu and nu_mu->nu_tau long-baseline\noscillations and that the CP-odd asymmetry in the latter channel can reach the\nmaximal value allowed by the unitarity of the mixing matrix. Some schemes with\nmixing of three neutrinos are also considered.\n", "  We discuss methods to resolve the ambiguities in CP violating phase angles\n$\\phi$ that are left when a measurement of $\\sin 2 \\phi$ is made. We show what\nknowledge of hadronic quantities will be needed to fully resolve all such\nambiguities.\n", "  We study the decay of the inflaton in a renormalizable two scalar theory.\nSince the dynamics of the system is dominated by states with large occupation\nnumbers which admit a semiclassical description, the decay can be studied by\nsolving the classical equations of motion on the lattice. Of particular\ninterest is the case when the cross-coupling between the inflaton and the\nsecond scalar field is negative, which is naturally allowed in many realistic\nmodels. While the inflaton decays via parametric resonance in the positive\ncoupling case we find that for negative coupling there is a new mechanism of\nparticle production which we call negative coupling instability. Due to this\nnew mechanism the variances of the fields grow significantly larger before the\nproduction is shut off by the backreaction of the created particles. We also\nfind that heavy particles are produced much more efficiently with negative\ncoupling, which is of prime importance for GUT baryogenesis. Using a simple toy\nmodel for baryogenesis and the results of our lattice simulations we show that\nfor natural values of the cross-coupling enough 10^{14}GeV bosons are created\nto produce a baryon to entropy ratio consistent with observation. For positive\ncoupling the value of the cross-coupling required to produce such massive\nparticles is unnaturally large. In addition to our numerical results we obtain\nanalytical estimates for the maximum variances of the fields in an expanding\nuniverse for all cases of interest in our model.\n", "  Using the results of a high precision calculation of the solar neutrino\nsurvival probability for Earth crossing neutrinos in the case of MSW $\\nu_e \\to\n\\nu_{\\mu(\\tau)}$ transition solution of the solar neutrino problem, performed\nin an earlier study, we derive predictions for the one-year averaged day-night\n(D-N) asymmetry in the deformations of the $e^-$ - spectrum to be measured with\nthe Super - Kamiokande detector, and for the D-N asymmetry in the energy-\nintegrated one year signal in this detector. The asymmetries are calculated for\nsolar $\\nu_e$ crossing the Earth mantle only, the core and the (mantle + core)\nfor a large representative set of values of the MSW transition parameters\n$\\Delta m^2$ and $\\sin^2 2\\theta_v$ from the ``conservative'' MSW solution\nregion obtained by taking into account possible uncertainties in the values of\nthe $^8$B and $^7$Be neutrino fluxes. The effect of the uncertainties in the\nvalue of the bulk matter density and in the chemical composition of the core,\non the D-N asymmetry predictions is discussed. It is shown, in particular, that\nfor $\\sin^2 2\\theta_v \\leq 0.013$ the one year average D-N asymmetry for\nneutrinos crossing the Earth core can be larger than the asymmetry for (only\nmantle crossing + core crossing) neutrinos by a factor of up to six. Iso -\n(D-N) asymmetry contours in the $\\Delta m^2 - \\sin^2 2\\theta_v$ plane for the\nSuper - Kamiokande detector are derived in the region $\\sin^2 2\\theta_v \\gsim\n10^{-4}$ for only mantle crossing, core crossing and (only mantle crossing +\ncore crossing) neutrinos. Our results indicate that the Super - Kamiokande\nexperiment might be able to test the $\\sin^2 2\\theta_v \\le 0.01$ region of the\nMSW solution of the solar neutrino problem by performing selective D-N\nasymmetry measurements.\n", "  We consider diagonal and non-diagonal QCD sum rules for the ground state\nheavy baryons to leading order in $1/m_Q$ and at next-to-leading order in\n$\\alpha_S$. In the non-diagonal case we evaluate the eight different two-loop\ndiagrams which determine the perturbative $\\alpha_S$-corrections to the Wilson\ncoefficient of the quark condensate in the Operator Product Expansion. The QCD\ncorrections to the non-diagonal sum rules are moderate compared to the QCD\ncorrections in the diagonal case. We also consider constituent type sum rules\nusing constituent type interpolating currents. The obtained results are in\nreasonable agreement with the corresponding results obtained in the diagonal\ncase. As central values for the bound state energies we find $m(\\Lambda_Q)-m_Q\n= 760 MeV$ and $m(\\Sigma_Q)-m_Q = 940 MeV$. The central values for the residues\nare given by $F(\\Lambda_Q) = 0.030 GeV^3$ and $F(\\Sigma_Q) = 0.038 GeV^3$.\n", "  We have recently presented the complete O(alpha_s^2) corrections to the\nsemileptonic decay width of the b quark at maximal recoil. Here we discuss\nvarious technical aspects of that calculation and further applications of\nsimilar methods. In particular, we describe an expansion which facilitates the\nphase space integrations and the treatment of the mixed real-virtual\ncorrections, for which Taylor expansion does not work and the so-called eikonal\nexpansion must be employed. Several terms of the expansion are given for the\nO(alpha_s^2) QCD corrections to the differential semileptonic decay width of\nthe b --quark at maximal recoil. We also demonstrate how the light quark loop\ncorrections to the top quark decay rate can be obtained using the same methods.\nWe briefly discuss the application of these techniques to the calculation of\nthe O(alpha_s^2) correction to zero recoil sum rules for heavy flavor\ntransitions.\n", "  In strongly-coupled theories with no small parameters, there are factors of\n4\\pi that appear when the couplings of the low-energy effective lagrangian are\nwritten in units of the effective cutoff \\Lambda. These numerical factors can\nbe explained using \"naive dimensional analysis.\" We extend these ideas to\nsupersymmetric theories, and show how to systematically include small\nparameters and couplings to weakly-interacting fields. The basic principle is\nthat if the fundamental theory is strongly coupled, then the effective theory\nmust also be strongly coupled at the scale \\Lambda. We use our results to\nanalyze several examples where strong supersymmetric dynamics may be relevant\nfor phenomenology. For models that break supersymmetry through strong dynamics\nwith no small parameters, we show that the Goldstino decay constant F is of\norder \\La^{2} / (4\\pi). We also consider theories with standard-model gauge\nbosons coupled directly to strong supersymmetry-breaking dynamics near the weak\nscale; smoothly-confining theories; and a model that breaks supersymmetry\nthrough the mechanism of a deformed moduli space.\n", "  The pion decay constant and mass are computed at low temperature within\nChiral Perturbation Theory to two loops. The effects of the breaking of Lorentz\nSymmetry by the thermal equilibrium state are discussed. The validity of the\nGell-Mann Oakes Renner relation at finite temperature is examined.\n", "  If one assumes solar and LSND neutrino oscillations to explain the\ncorresponding data, then the atmospheric neutrino deficit cannot be\naccommodated within the Standard Model with three light flavors, unless one\nignores the data's zenith-angle dependence. We propose a novel solution to this\nproblem by postulating large anomalous diagonal $\\nu_\\tau$-quark interactions\nwhich affect $\\nu_\\mu - \\nu_\\tau$ oscillations traversing the Earth and induce\nthe observed zenith-angle dependence.\n", "  We have shown recently that the resummation of soft photon contributions\nleads to a non-exponential decay of the fermion excitations in hot QED plasmas.\nThe retarded propagator of a massless fermion was found to behave as $S_R(t >>\n1/gT) \\sim \\exp{-\\alpha T t [\\ln(\\omega_p t) + C]}$, where $\\omega_p=gT/3$ is\nthe plasma frequency, $\\alpha=g^2/4\\pi$, and $C$ is a constant, independent of\n$g$, which was left undefined. This term is computed in this paper. In gauges\nwith unphysical degrees of freedom, it is gauge-fixing independent provided an\ninfrared regulator is introduced in the gauge sector. We also extend our\nanalysis to hot QCD and express the quark and gluon propagators in the form of\nthree-dimensional Euclidean functional integrals which may be evaluated on the\nlattice.\n", "  We evaluate the supersymmetric QCD corrections to single top quark production\nvia $q \\bar q'\\to t \\bar b$ at the Fermilab Tevatron in the minimal\nsupersymmetric model. We find that within the allowed range of squark and\ngluino masses the supersymmetric QCD corrections can enhance the cross section\nby a few percent. The combined effects of SUSY QCD, SUSY EW, and the Yukawa\ncouplings can exceed 10% for the smallest allowed $\\tan\\beta~ (\\simeq 0.25)$\nbut are only a few percent for $\\tan\\beta >1$.\n", "  The production of heavy quarkonium as QQbar bound-states in hadron-hadron\ncollisions is considered within the framework of a space-time description,\ncombining parton-cascade evolution with a coalescence model for bound-state\nformation. The `hard' production of the initial QQbar, directly or via gluon\nfragmentation and including both color-singlet and color-octet contributions,\nis calculated from the PQCD cross-sections. The subsequent development of the\nQQbar system is described within a space-time generalization of the DGLAP\nparton-evolution formalism in position- and momentum-space. The actual\nformation of the bound-states is accomplished through overlap of the QQbar pair\nand a spectrum of quarkonium wave-functions. This coalescence can only occur\nafter sufficent gluon radiation reduces the QQbar relative velocity to a value\ncommensurate with the non-relativistic kinematics of these bound systems. The\npresence of gluon participants in the cascade then is both necessary and leads\nto the natural inclusion of both color-singlet and color-octet mechanisms. The\napplication of this approach to pp (ppbar) collisions from sqrt(s)= 30 GeV - 14\nTeV reveals very decent agreement with available data from ISR and Tevatron -\nwithout the necessity of introducing fit parameters. Moreover, production\nprobabilities are calculated for a complete spectrum of charmonium and\nbottonium states, with the relative significance compared to open charm\n(bottom) production. An analysis of the space-time development is carried\nthrough which sheds light on the relevance of gluon radiation and\ncolor-structure, suggesting a correponding experimental investigation.\n", "  Within the framework of QED we investigate the inclusive J/\\psi production at\n$e^+e^-$ colliders. It is expected to be as a further test to the charmonium\nproduction mechanisms and QED. We find that at the energies of CESR, BEPC, and\nTRISTAN (e.g. 4.0 GeV \\leq \\sqrt s \\leq 60 GeV), the contributions of the\nconcerned electromagnetic processes to the $J/\\psi$ inclusive production are\ngreat, even dominant, thus they greatly affect the observation of the\ncolor-octet $J/\\psi$ production signature at $e^+e^-$ colliders. The production\nof \\psi', being similar to that of J/\\psi's, is roughly estimated, and its\ninfluence on the observation of the color-octet J/\\psi production signature in\ne^+e^- collision is also discussed.\n", "  We calculate the contributions of penguin diagrams with internal u or c\nquarks to various inclusive charmless B-decay rates. Further we analyze the\ninfluence of the chromomagnetic dipole operator Q_8 on these rates. We find\nthat the rates corresponding to B-bar --> X_{u u-bar s}, B-bar --> X_{d d-bar\ns}, B-bar --> X_{s s-bar s}, B-bar --> X_{s s-bar d} and B --> X_{d d-bar d}\nare dominated by the new penguin contributions. The contributions of Q_8\nsizably diminish these rates. Despite of an increase of the total charmless\ndecay rate by 36 % the new contributions are not large enough to explain the\ncharm deficit observed by ARGUS and CLEO. We predict n_c=1.33 +/- 0.06 for the\naverage number of charmed particles per B-decay in the Standard Model. Then the\nhypothesis of an enhancement of the chromomagnetic dipole coefficient C_8 by\nnew physics contributions is analyzed. We perform a model independent fit of\nC_8 to the experimental data. If the CKM structure of the new physics\ncontribution is the same as in the Standard Model, |C_8(M_W)| must be enhanced\nby a factor of 9 to 16 in order to explain the observed charm deficit.\n", "  The production in high-energy hadron collisions of a pair of jets with large\nrapidity separation is studied in an improved BFKL formalism. By recasting the\nanalytic solution of the BFKL equation as an explicit order-by-order sum over\nemitted gluons, the effects of phase space constraints and the running coupling\nare studied. Particular attention is paid to the azimuthal angle decorrelation\nof the jet pair. The inclusion of sub-leading effects significantly improves\nthe agreement between the theoretical predictions and recent preliminary\nmeasurements from the Dzero collaboration.\n", "  We study doubly polarised asymmetries of c-cbar and b-bbar mesons in hadro-\nand photo-production at low transverse momentum in non-relativistic QCD to high\norders in the relative velocity of the pair, v. We give the complete set of\nexpressions required for the asymmetries up to order v^9. The asymmetries in\nthe production of eta_{c,b} states are a stable measure of the polarised gluon\ndensities. The asymmetries for chi_{c,b}, J/psi, psi', and the various Upsilon\nstates are stringent tests of the NRQCD scaling relations.\n", "  It is possible to place constraints on non-Standard-Model gauge-boson\nself-couplings and other new physics by studying their one-loop contributions\nto precisely measured observables. We extend previous analyses which constrain\nsuch nonstandard couplings, and we present the results in a compact and\ntransparent form. Particular attention is given to comparing results for the\nlight-Higgs scenario, where nonstandard effects are parameterized by an\neffective Lagrangian with a linear realization of the electroweak symmetry\nbreaking sector, and the heavy-Higgs/strongly interacting scenario, described\nby the electroweak chiral Lagrangian. The constraints on nonstandard\ngauge-boson self-couplings which are obtained from a global analysis of\nlow-energy data and LEP/SLC measurements on the Z pole are updated and improved\nfrom previous studies. Replaced version: tables and figures of Section VIb\nrecalculated. There were roundoff problems, especially in Fig. 8. Text\nunchanged.\n", "  We present a calculation of the two-loop anomalous dimension for the\ntransversity distribution h_1(x,Q^2), $\\gamma^{h(1)}_n$, in the MS scheme of\nthe dimensional regularization. Due to the chiral-odd nature, h_1 does not mix\nwith the gluon distributions, and thus our result is the same for the\nflavor-singlet and nonsinglet distributions. At small n (moment of h_1),\n$\\gamma^{h(1)}_n$ is significantly larger than $\\gamma^{f(1)}_n$ (the anomalous\ndimension for the nonsinglet f_1), but approaches $\\gamma^{f(1)}_n$ very\nquickly at large n, keeping the relation $\\gamma^{h(1)}_n > \\gamma^{f(1)}_n$.\nThis feature is in parallel to the relation between the one-loop anomalous\ndimension for f_1 and h_1.\n", "  We find that single spin asymmetries in NRQCD are non-vanishing in general.\nThey are proportional to the imaginary parts of some non-perturbative matrix\nelements. With statistics of about 10^6 identified J/psi's, or 10^5 identified\nchi_2, it is possible to measure these imaginary parts even if they are an\norder of magnitude smaller than the real parts. Such statistics are quite\nreasonable at polarised HERA N and other future experiments.\n", "  The QCD corrections to the moments of the invariant mass distribution in the\nsemileptonic $\\tau$ decays are considered. The effect of the renormalization\nscheme dependence on the fitted values of alpha_s(m^2_tau) and the condensates\nis discussed, using a simplified approach where the nonperturbative\ncontributions are approximated by the dimension six condensates. The fits in\nthe vector and the axial-vector channel are investigated in the next-to-leading\nand the next-to-next-to-leading order. The next-to-next-to-leading order\nresults are found to be relatively stable with respect to change of the\nrenormalization scheme. A change from the MS-bar scheme to the minimal\nsensitivity scheme results in the reduction of the extracted value of\nalpha_s(m^2_tau) by 0.01.\n", "  We solve a radial Schr\\\"odinger equation for the case of a multichannel\nsquare well plus an exponential potential in one of the channels. The solution\nis obtained by summing exactly the infinite terms of the perturbative series\nfor the evolution operator of the system. Analytical expressions for the\nscattering matrix and the scattering length are given, a Deser-like formula\nwhich connects approximate ground energies and scattering length is obtained\nfor a particular case. Possible physical applications of these results are\ndiscussed briefly.\n", "  The least well-known octet baryon mass is $M_{\\Xi^0} = 1314.9 \\pm 0.6$ MeV.\nThe prospect of an improved measurement of its mass by the KTeV experimental\nprogram at Fermilab, and opportunities for improvements in charged and excited\nhyperon and $\\Delta$ mass measurements, makes it timely to re-examine\ndescriptions of isospin splittings in baryons containing light quarks. It is\npossible by examining such relations as the Coleman-Glashow relation $M_n - M_p\n+ M_{\\Xi^-} - M_{\\Xi^0} = M_{\\Sigma^-} - M_{\\Sigma^+}$ to distinguish between\nthose models making use of one- or two-body effects involving quarks and those\ninvolving genuine three-body effects. A hierarchy based on an expansion in\n$1/N_c$, where $N_c$ is the number of quark colors, is useful in this respect.\nThe present status of other quark-model mass relations involving $\\Lambda -\n\\Sigma^0$ mixing and the baryon decuplet is also noted, and the degree to which\none can determine parameters such as quark mass differences and individual\nelectromagnetic contributions to splittings is discussed.\n", "  We derive consistency conditions which constrain the possible form of the\nstrong couplings of the excited baryons to the pions. The consistency\nconditions follow from requiring the pion-excited baryon scattering amplitudes\nto satisfy the large-N_c Witten counting rules and are analogous to consistency\nconditions used by Dashen, Jenkins and Manohar and others for s-wave baryons.\nThe consistency conditions are explicitly solved, giving the most general\nallowed form of the strong vertices for excited baryons in the large-N_c limit.\nWe show that the solutions to the large-N_c consistency conditions coincide\nwith the predictions of the nonrelativistic quark model for these states,\nextending the results previously obtained for the s-wave baryons. The 1/N_c\ncorrections to these predictions are studied in the quark model with arbitrary\nnumber of colors N_c.\n", "  The anomalous behavior of the spin-spin correlation at large momentum\ntransfer in pp elastic scattering is described in terms of the degrees of\nfreedom associated with the onset of the charm threshold. A non-perturbative\nanalysis based on the symmetries of QCD is used to extract the relevant\ndynamics of the charmonium-proton interaction. The enhancement to pp amplitudes\nand their phase follow from analyticity and unitarity, giving a plausible\nexplanation of the spin anomaly. The interaction between charmonium and light\nquarks in nuclei may form a distinct kind of nuclear matter, nuclear bound\nquarkonium.\n", "  It is possible to place direct constraints on WW-photon and WWZ couplings by\nstudying their tree-level contributions to the process e^+e^- ---> W^+W^-.\nHowever, these couplings also contribute at the loop level to e^+e^- ---> f\nfbar processes where `f' is any Standard-Model fermion. In this paper the\navailable LEP1.5 and LEP2 data, the anticipated LEP2 data and possible linear\ncollider data for these latter processes is combined with low-energy and Z-pole\ndata to place indirect constraints on nonstandard WW-photon and WWZ couplings.\nThe direct and indirect constraints are then compared. An effective Lagrangian\nis used to describe the new physics. In order that the implications of this\nanalysis are as broad as possible, both the light-Higgs scenario, described by\nan effective Lagrangian with a linear realization of the symmetry-breaking\nsector, and the strongly interacting scenario, described by the electroweak\nchiral Lagrangian, are considered.\n", "  Pad'e approximants are used to improve the convergence behavior of\nperturbative results in massless scalar and gauge field theories at finite\ntemperature.\n", "  We calculate final-state interaction corrections to the energy-angular\ndistribution of l^+ in semi-leptonic top quark decay, where the parent top\nquark is produced via e^+e^- -> t\\bar{t} near threshold. These are the\ncorrections due to gluon exchange between t and \\bar{b} (\\bar{t} and b) and\nbetween b and \\bar{b}. Combining with previously known other corrections, we\nexplicitly write down the l^+ energy-angular distribution including the full\nO(alpha_s)=O(beta) corrections near t\\bar{t} threshold. Numerical analyses of\nthe final-state interaction corrections are given. We find that they deform the\nl^+ distribution typically at the 10% level. We also find that all qualitative\nfeatures of the numerical results can be understood from intuitive pictures.\nThe mechanisms of various effects of the final-state interactions are\nelucidated. Finally we define an observable which is proper to the decay\nprocess of the top quark (dependent only on d\\Gamma_{t -> b l^+ \\nu}/ dE_l\nd\\Omega_l of a free polarized top quark) near t\\bar{t} threshold. Such a\nquantity will be useful in extracting the decay property of the top quark using\nthe highly polarized top quark samples.\n", "  A particular class of variant axion models with two higgs doublets and a\nsinglet is studied. In these models the axion couples either to the $u$-quark\nor $t$-quark or both, but not to $b$, $c$, $s$, or $d$. When the axion couples\nto only one quark the models possess the desirable feature of having no domain\nwall problem, which makes them viable candidates for a cosmological axion\nstring scenario. We calculate the axion couplings to leptons, photons and\nnucleons, and the astrophysical constraints on the axion decay constant $v_a$\nare investigated and compared to the DFSZ axion model. We find that the most\nrestrictive lower bound on $v_a$, that from SN1987a, is lowered by up to a\nfactor of about 30, depending on the model and also the ratio of the vacuum\nexpectation values of the higgs doublets. For scenarios with axionic strings,\nthe allowed window for $v_a$ in the $u$ quark model can be more than two orders\nof magnitude. For inflationary scenarios, the cosmological upper bound on\n$v_a/N$, where $N$ is the QCD anomaly factor, is unaffected: however, the\nvariant models have $N$ either 3 or 6 times smaller than the DFSZ model.\n", "  The difference in the time dependent CP asymmetries between the modes $B -->\npsi K_S$ and $B --> phi K_S$ is a clean signal for physics beyond the Standard\nModel. This interpretation could fail if there is a large enhancement of the\nmatrix element of the $b --> u ubar s$ operator between the $B_d$ initial state\nand the $phi K_S$ final state. We argue against this possibility and propose\nsome experimental tests that could shed light on the situation.\n", "  The Fermilab top quark analysis is heavily dependent on the assumption of\nstandard model backgrounds only. In the light gluino scenario, the stop quarks\nlie near the top in mass and their decays can influence the resulting top quark\nmass by an amount that is not small relative to the currently quoted errors.\nSeveral slight anomalies in the top quark analysis find a natural explanation\nin the light gluino case.\n", "  Jets observed in hadron-hadron scattering contain a contribution from the\nunderlying event that is produced by spectator interactions taking place\nincoherently with the major parton-parton collision, due to the extended\ncomposite structure of the colliding hadrons. Using a recent measurement of the\ndouble parton interaction rate, we calculate that the underlying event may be 2\n- 3 times stronger than generally assumed, as a result of semi-hard\nperturbative multiple-parton interactions. This can have an important influence\non the inclusive jet cross section at moderate values of E_T, persisting at the\n5 - 10% level to the largest observable E_T. We show how the underlying event\ncan be measured accurately using a generalization of the method first proposed\nby Marchesini and Webber.\n", "  We study the process e^{-} e^{+} -> chi^0_1 chi^0_2 with the subsequent decay\nchi^0_2 -> chi^0_1 l^{+} l^{-} taking into account the complete spin\ncorrelations. We give the analytical formulae for the differential cross\nsection and present numerical results for the lepton angular distribution and\nthe distribution of the opening angle between the outgoing leptons for the LEP2\nenergy of sqrt{s}=193 GeV and for sqrt{s}=500 GeV. We examine three\nrepresentative mixing scenarios in the MSSM and also study the influence of the\ncommon scalar mass parameter m_0 on the shape of the distributions. For the\nlepton angular distribution the effect of the spin correlations amounts to up\nto 20% for lower energies. We find that the opening angle distribution is\nsuitable for distinguishing between higgsino-like and gaugino-like neutralinos.\nThe shape of the lepton angular distribution is very sensitive to the mixing in\nthe gaugino sector and to the value of m_0. For higher energies it is also\nsuitable for distinguishing between higgsino-like and gaugino-like neutralino.\n", "  Bremsstrahlung of photons from highly relativistic electrons is investigated.\nThe cross section of the processes, which is suppressed due to a multiple\nscattering of an emitting electron in dense media (LPM effect) and due to\nphoton interaction with electrons of a medium, is calculated with an accuracy\nup to \"next to leading logarithm\" and with the Coulomb corrections taken into\naccount. Making allowances for a multiple scattering and a polarization of a\nmedium an analysis of radiation on a target boundary is carried out. The method\nof consideration of radiation in a thin target under influence of the LPM\neffect is developed. Interrelation with the recent experiment is discussed.\n", "  We construct supersymmetric gauge theories with new mechanisms of dynamical\nsupersymmetry breaking. The models have flat directions at the classical level,\nand different mechanisms lift these flat directions in different regions of the\nclassical moduli space. In one branch of the moduli space, supersymmetry is\nbroken by confinement in a novel manner. The models contain only dimensionless\ncouplings and have large groups of unbroken global symmetries, making them\npotentially interesting for model-building. As an illustrative application, we\ncouple the standard model gauge group to a model with an SU(5) global symmetry,\nresulting in a model with composite messengers and a non-minimal spectrum of\nsuperpartner masses.\n", "  The usual sphaleron bound and the statement of the impossibility of baryon\nproduction at a second order phase transition or analytic cross-over are\nreformulated in the first part of the paper as requirements of the expansion\nrate of the Universe at the electroweak scale. With an (exact or effective)\nadditional contribution to the energy density scaling as 1/a^6, which dominates\nuntil just before nucleosynthesis, the observed baryon asymmetry may be\nproduced at the electroweak scale in simple extensions of the Minimal Standard\nModel, even in the case that the phase transition is not first order. We focus\nour attention on one such cosmology, in which the Universe goes through a\nperiod termed `kination' in which its energy is dominated by the kinetic energy\nof a scalar field. The required kinetic energy dominated modes can occur either\nas a field rolls down an exponential (or steeper) potential, or in the\noscillation of a field about the minimum of a steep power-law potential. We\nimplement in detail the former case with a single exponential field first\ndriving inflation, and then rolling into a kinetic energy dominated mode.\nReheating is achieved using an alternative to the usual mechanism due to\nSpokoiny, in which the Universe is `reheated' by particle creation in the\nexpanding background. Density perturbations of the magnitude required for\nstructure formation may also be generated. We show that the analogous model for\nthe power-law potential cannot be consistently implemented. In models with\ninflation driven by a second field and the usual mechanism of reheating (by\ndecay of the inflaton) the required kinetic energy dominated cosmology is\nviable in both types of potential.\n", "  We investigate the signal $\\gamma\\gamma$ + missing energy in a high-energy\nlinear $e^+e^-$ collider, with a view to differentiating between gauge-mediated\nsupersymmetry breaking and the conventional supersymmetric models. Prima facie,\nthere is considerable chance of confusion between the two scenarios if the\nassumption of gaugino mass unification is relaxed. We show that the use of\npolarized electron beams enables one to distinguish between the two schemes in\nmost cases. There are some regions in the parameter space where this idea does\nnot work, and we suggest some additional methods of distinction. We also\nperform an analysis of some signals in the gauge-mediated model, coming from\nthe pair production of the second-lightest neutralino.\n", "  Gauge theories induced by scalars in the fundamental representation of the\n$U(N_c)_{gauge}\\times U(N_f)_{global}$ group are investigated in the large\n$N_c$ and $N_f$ limit. A master field is defined from bilinears of the scalar\nfield following an Eguchi-Kawai type reduction of spacetime. The density\nfunction for the master field satisfies an integral equation that can be solved\nexactly in two dimensions (D=2) and in a convergent series of approximations at\n$D>2$. While at D=2 the system is in the same phase at all $\\epsilon=N_c/N_f$,\nit undergoes a phase transition at a critical value, $\\epsilon_c(D)$, for\n$D>2$.\n", "  We study the physics of spontaneously broken family symmetries acting on the\nthird generation. Massless familons (or Majorons) $f$ associated with such\nbroken symmetries are motivated especially by cosmological scenarios with\ndecaying tau neutrinos. We first note that, in marked contrast with the case\nfor the first two generations, constraints on third generation familon\ncouplings are poor, and are, in fact, non-existent at present in the hadronic\nsector. We derive new bounds from $B^0$--$\\bar{B}^0$ mixing, $B^0 \\to l^+\nl'^-$, $b\\to s\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$, and astrophysics. The resulting constraints on\nfamilon decay constants are still much weaker than those for the first and\nsecond generation. We then discuss the promising prospects for significant\nimprovements from searches for $\\tau\\to l f$, $B\\to (\\pi, K) f$, and $b\\to\n(d,s) f$ with the current CLEO, ARGUS, and LEP data. Finally, we note that\nfuture constraints from CLEO III and the $B$ factories will probe decay\nconstants beyond 10^8 GeV, well within regions of parameter space favored by\nproposed scenarios in neutrino cosmology.\n", "  The wave function of a light pseudoscalar meson is considered and\nnonperturbative corrections as signaled by perturbation theory are calculated.\nTwo schemes are used, the massive gluon and the running coupling scheme. Both\nindicate the presence of leading power corrections of ${\\cal O}(b^2)$, whose\nexponentiation leads to a Gaussian dependence of the wave function on the\nimpact parameter $b$. The dependence of this correction on the light cone\nenergy fractions of the quark and the antiquark is discussed and compared with\nother models for the meson.\n", "  We examine simulations of the formation of domain walls, cosmic strings, and\nmonopoles on a cubic lattice, in which the topological defects are assumed to\nlie at the zeros of a piecewise constant 1, 2, or 3 component Gaussian random\nfield, respectively. We derive analytic expressions for the corresponding\ntopological defect densities in the continuum limit and show that they fail to\nagree with simulation results, even when the fields are smoothed on small\nscales to eliminate lattice effects. We demonstrate that this discrepancy,\nwhich is related to a classic geometric fallacy, is due to the anisotropy of\nthe cubic lattice, which cannot be eliminated by smoothing. This problem can be\nresolved by linearly interpolating the field values on the lattice, which gives\nresults in good agreement with the continuum predictions. We use this procedure\nto obtain a lattice-free estimate (for Gaussian smoothing) of the fraction of\nthe total length of string in the form of infinite strings: $f_\\infty = 0.716\n\\pm 0.015$.\n", "  The discovery of a heavy Higgs boson with mass up to m_H = 1 TeV at the CERN\nLHC is possible in the H--> W^+W^- --> l nu jj decay mode. The weak boson\nscattering signal and backgrounds from t\\bar tjj and from W+jets production are\nanalyzed with parton level Monte Carlo programs which are built on full tree\nlevel amplitudes for all subprocesses. The use of double jet tagging and the\nreconstruction of the W invariant mass reduce the combined backgrounds to the\nsame level as the Higgs signal. A central mini-jet veto, which distinguishes\nthe different gluon radiation patterns of the hard processes, further improves\nthe signal to background ratio to about 2.5:1, with a signal cross section of 1\nfb. The jet energy asymmetry of the W --> jj decay will give a clear signature\nof the longitudinal polarization of the W's in the final event sample.\n", "  Extending our earlier treatments of pi0, eta_c and eta_b, we study the\neta-eta' system and its gamma-gamma decays using a model which is a leading\nversion of the consistently coupled Schwinger-Dyson (SD) and Bethe-Salpeter\n(BS) approach. The electromagnetic interactions are incorporated through a\n(generalized) impulse approximation consistent with this bound-state approach,\nso that the Ward-Takahashi identities of QED are preserved when quarks are\ndynamically dressed. To overcome some of the limitations due to the ladder\napproximation, we introduce a minimal extension to the bound--state approach\nemployed, so that the U_A(1) problem is avoided. Pointing out which of our\npredictions hold in the coupled SD-BS approach in general, and which are the\nconsequences of the specific, chosen model, we present the results for the\naxial-current decay constants of eta_8, eta_0, and of their physical\ncombinations eta and eta', the results for the gamma-gamma decay constants of\neta_0 and eta_8, for the two-photon decay widths of eta and eta', and for the\nmixing-independent R-ratio constructed from them.\n", "  I derive a single factorization formula which summarizes all soft and\ncollinear divergences of a tree-level gauge theory amplitude. The singular\nfactor squared is in a certain sense the generalization of the Catani-Seymour\ndipole factorization formula.\n", "  We discuss the effects of so-called gluonic poles in twist-three hadronic\nmatrix elements, as first considered by Qiu and Sterman, in the Drell-Yan\nprocess. These effects cannot be distinguished from those of time-reversal odd\ndistribution functions, although time-reversal invariance is not broken by the\npresence of gluonic poles. Both gluonic poles and time-reversal odd\ndistribution functions can lead to the same single spin asymmetries. We\nexplicitly show the connection between gluonic poles and large distance gluon\nfields, identify the possible single spin asymmetries in the Drell-Yan process\nand discuss the role of intrinsic transverse momentum of the partons.\n", "  Considering semileptonic decays of the entangled B^0 \\bar B^0 state which is\ngenerated in the decay of Upsilon(4S), we simply multiply the\nquantum-mechanical interference term by a factor (1-\\zeta) and use the\n``decoherence parameter'' \\zeta as a measure for deviations from quantum\nmechanics. We investigate several consequences of this modification of\nsemileptonic B^0 \\bar B^0 decays. In particular, we show that when confronted\nwith the experimental values of the ratio R=(# like-sign dilepton events)/(#\nopposite-sign dilepton events) and of the B_H--B_L mass difference, the ensuing\none standard deviation range of the decoherence parameter depends strongly on\nthe basis in the B^0--\\bar B^0 space used to build the entangled B^0 \\bar B^0\nstate. On the other hand, in quantum mechanics physical quantities are, of\ncourse, independent of such arbitrary basis choices.\n", "  The role of inelastic final-state interactions in CP asymmetries and\nbranching ratios is investigated in certain chosen single isospin two-body\nhadronic B decays. Treating final-state interactions through Pomeron and Regge\nexchanges, we demonstrate that inelastic final state interactions could lead to\nsizeable effects on the CP asymmetry.\n", "  We check numerically if Soffer's inequality for quark distributions is\npreserved by next-to-leading order QCD evolution. Assuming that the inequality\nis saturated at a low hadronic scale we estimate the maximal transverse double\nspin asymmetry for Drell-Yan muon pair production to next-to-leading order\naccuracy.\n", "  Weak radiative hyperon decays are discussed in the diquark-level approach. It\nis pointed out that in the general diquark formalism one may reproduce the\nexperimentally suggested pattern of asymmetries, while maintaining Hara's\ntheorem in the SU(3) limit. At present, however, no detailed quark-based model\nof parity-violating diquark-photon coupling exists that would have the\nnecessary properties.\n", "  We construct an extension of the standard Kogut-Susskind lattice model for\nclassical 3+1 dimensional Yang-Mills theory, in which ``classical particle''\ndegrees of freedom are added. We argue that this will correctly reproduce the\n``hard thermal loop'' effects of hard degrees of freedom, while giving a local\nimplementation which is numerically tractable. We prove that the extended\nsystem is Hamiltonian and has the same thermodynamics as dimensionally reduced\nhot Yang-Mills theory put on a lattice. We present a numerical update algorithm\nand study the abelian theory to verify that the classical gauge theory\nself-energy is correctly modified. Then we use the extended system to study the\ndiffusion constant for Chern-Simons number. We verify the Arnold-Son-Yaffe\npicture that the diffusion constant is inversely proportional to hard thermal\nloop strength. Our numbers correspond to a diffusion constant of Gamma = 29 +-\n6 alpha_w^5 T^4 for m_D^2 = 11 g^2 T^2/6.\n", "  We discuss experimental implications of extending the gauge structure of the\nStandard Model to include an additional U(1) interaction broken at or near the\nweak scale. We work with the most general, renormalizable Lagrangian for the\nSU(2)\\times U(1)\\times U(1) sector, with emphasis on the phenomenon of gauge\nkinetic mixing between the two U(1) gauge fields, and do not restrict ourselves\nto any of the \"canonical\" Z' models often discussed in the literature.\nLow-energy processes and Z-pole precision measurements are specifically\naddressed.\n", "  The sources of $W + n$-jet events in hadron collisions are higher-order QCD\nprocesses, but also multiple-parton interactions. A subprocess producing a $W +\nk$-jet final state, followed by one producing $l$ jets in the same\nnucleon-nucleon interaction, will result in a $W + n$-jet event if $k + l = n$.\nIn the simplest case a $W + 2$-jet event can be produced by a quark-antiquark\nannihilation into $W$ and a 2-jet event occurring in the same proton-antiproton\ninteraction. We compute that this happens at the 10% level of the higher-order\nQCD processes for the type of cuts made by the Tevatron experiments. For jet\n$p_T$ values of order $5{\\sim}10$ GeV, multiple-parton interactions dominate\nhigher-order QCD-processes. The emergence of this new source of $W + n$-jet\nevents towards lower $p_T $ simulates the running of $\\alpha_s$; it is\nimperative to remove these processes from the event sample in order to extract\ninformation on the strong coupling constant. Also, BFKL studies of low-$p_T$\njet cross sections are held hostage to a detailed understanding of the\nmultiple-parton interactions. We perform the calculations required to achieve\nthese goals. A detailed experimental analysis of the data may, for the first\ntime, determine the effective areas occupied by quarks and gluons in the\nnucleon. These are not necessarily identical. We also compute the\nmultiple-parton contribution to $Z + n$-jet events.\n", "  We derive non-perturbative relations between the expectation value of the\ninvariant element in a homogeneous and isotropic state and the quantum\ngravitationally induced pressure and energy density. By exploiting previously\nobtained bounds for the maximum possible growth of perturbative corrections to\na locally de Sitter background we show that the two loop result dominates all\nhigher orders. We also show that the quantum gravitational slowing of inflation\nbecomes non-perturbatively strong earlier than previously expected.\n", "  We present calculations of several pp scattering cross sections with\npotential applications at the LHC. Significantly large rates for momentum\nfraction, x, as low as 10^-7 are obtained, allowing for possible extraction of\nquark and gluon densities in the proton and nuclei down to these small x values\nprovided a detector with good acceptance at maximal rapidities is used.\n", "  We calculate penguin contributions to the lifetime splitting between the B_s\nand the B_d meson. In the Standard Model the penguin effects are found to be\nopposite in sign, but of similar magnitude as the contributions of the\ncurrent-current operators, despite of the smallness of the penguin\ncoefficients. We predict\n  tau(B_s)/tau(B_d) -1 = ( -1.2 +/- 10.0 ) * 10^(-3) * (f_{B_s}/190 MeV)^2\nwhere the error stems from hadronic uncertainties. Since penguin coefficients\nare sensitive to new physics and poorly tested experimentally, we analyze the\npossibility to extract them from a future precision measurement of\ntau(B_s)/tau(B_d). Anticipating progress in the determination of the hadronic\nparameters epsilon_1, epsilon_2 and f_{B_s}/f_{B_d} we find that the\ncoefficient C_4 can be extracted with an uncertainty of order |Delta C_4|= 0.1\nfrom the double ratio (tau(B_s)-tau(B_d))/(tau(B^+)-tau(B_d)), if\n|epsilon_1-epsilon_2| is not too small.\n", "  We show that a large class of two-field models of single-bubble open\ninflation do not lead to infinite open universes, as it was previously thought,\nbut to an ensemble of very large but finite inflating `islands'. The reason is\nthat the quantum tunneling responsible for the nucleation of the bubble does\nnot occur simultaneously along both field directions and equal-time\nhypersurfaces in the open universe are not synchronized with equal-density or\nfixed-field hypersurfaces. The most probable tunneling trajectory corresponds\nto a zero value of the inflaton field; large values, necessary for the second\nperiod of inflation inside the bubble, only arise as localized fluctuations.\nThe interior of each nucleated bubble will contain an infinite number of such\ninflating regions of comoving size of order $\\gamma^{-1}$, where $\\gamma$\ndepends on the parameters of the model. Each one of these islands will be a\nquasi-open universe. Since the volume of the hyperboloid is infinite, inflating\nislands with all possible values of the field at their center will be realized\ninside of a single bubble. We may happen to live in one of those patches of\ncomoving size $d\\lesssim \\gamma^{-1}$, where the universe appears to be open.\nIn particular, we consider the ``supernatural'' model proposed by Linde and\nMezhlumian. There, an approximate U(1) symmetry is broken by a tunneling field\nin a first order phase transition, and slow-roll inflation inside the nucleated\nbubble is driven by the pseudo-Goldstone field. We find that the excitations of\nthe pseudo-Goldstone produced by the nucleation and subsequent expansion of the\nbubble place severe constraints on this model. We also discuss the coupled and\nuncoupled two-field models.\n", "  Exclusive semileptonic Lambda_b decays to excited charmed Lambda_c baryons\nare investigated at order Lambda_{QCD}/m_Q in the heavy quark effective theory.\nThe differential decay rates are analyzed for the J^\\pi=1/2^- Lambda_c(2593)\nand the J^\\pi=3/2^- \\Lambda_c(2625). They receive 1/m_{c,b} corrections at zero\nrecoil that are determined by mass splittings and the leading order Isgur-Wise\nfunction. With some assumptions, we find that the branching fraction for\nLambda_b decays to these states is 2.5-3.3%. The decay rate to the helicity \\pm\n3/2 states, which vanishes for m_Q \\to \\infty, remains small at order\nLambda_{QCD}/m_Q since 1/m_c corrections do not contribute. Matrix elements of\nweak currents between a Lambda_b and other excited Lambda_c states are analyzed\nat zero-recoil to order Lambda_{QCD}/m_Q. Applications to baryonic heavy quark\nsum-rules are explored.\n", "  We compute the virtual next-to-leading corrections to the impact factors or\noff-shell coefficient functions in the high-energy limit. When combined with\nthe known real corrections, these results will provide the complete NLO\ncorrections to the impact factors, which are necessary to use the BFKL\nresummation at NLL for jet production at both lepton-hadron and hadron-hadron\ncolliders.\n", "  We study the tensor structure function $b_1\\xq$ in deep inelastic scattering\n(DIS) of an electron from a polarized deuteron target. We model the\nelectron-nucleon cross section at the starting point for $Q^2$ evolution by\nvector-meson-dominance (VMD). Shadowing due to the double-scattering of vector\nmesons, along with the presence of a d-state admixture in ground state deuteron\nwave function gives rise to a non-vanishing contribution to $b_1\\xq$. Although\nsignificant at large Bjorken $x$, the restoration of rotational symmetry for\nsmall $x$ ($\\leq10^{-3}$) requires that $b_1^{(2)}\\xq$ approach zero as $x\\to\n0$ in this model. If the model is valid, it should apply within the range of\npresent fixed target experiments.\n", "  We study the sensitivity of a 500 GeV $e^+e^-$ Linear Collider to $CP$\nviolating anomalous couplings. We find that with 50~fb$^{-1}$, and taking only\none non-zero coupling at a time, the process $e^+e^-\\to W^+ W^-$ can be used to\nplace the 95% confidence level bounds $|\\tilde\\kappa_\\gamma|\\leq0.1$,\n$|\\tilde\\kappa_Z|\\leq 0.1$ and $|g_4^Z|\\leq 0.1$ from CP even observables. By\nstudying certain distributions in the process $e^+e^-\\to\n\\mu^+\\mu^-\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ one of the bounds can be improved to $|g_4^Z| \\leq\n0.06$. This process also allows the construction of a CP odd observable which\ncan be used to place bounds on CP violating new physics. At the 95% confidence\nlevel we find $|\\tilde\\kappa_\\gamma|\\leq 0.3$, $|\\tilde\\kappa_Z|\\leq 0.2$ and a\nmuch weaker bound for $|g_4^Z|$.\n", "  We evaluate the decay constants for the B and $D$ mesons and the form factors\nfor the semileptonic decays of the B meson to $D$ and $D^*$ mesons in a\nBethe-Salpeter model. From data we extract $V_{cb}=0.039 \\pm 0.002$ from ${\\bar\nB} \\to D^* l {\\bar{\\nu}} $ and $V_{cb}=0.037 \\pm 0.004$ from ${\\bar B} \\to D l\n{\\bar{\\nu}} $ decays. The form factors are then used to obtain non-leptonic\ndecay partial widths for $ B\\to D \\pi (K) $ and $B \\to D D (D_s) $ in the\nfactorization approximation.\n", "  The temporal and spatial coherence widths of the microscopic process by which\na neutrino is detected are incorporated in the quantum mechanical wave packet\ntreatment of neutrino oscillations, confirming the observation of Kiers,\nNussinov and Weiss that an accurate measurement of the energies of the\nparticles participating in the detection process can increase the coherence\nlength. However, the wave packet treatment presented here shows that the\ncoherence length has an upper bound, determined by the neutrino energy and the\nmass-squared difference, beyond which the coherence of the oscillation process\nis lost.\n", "  In a number of field theoretical models the vacuum angle \\theta enters\nphysics in the combination \\theta/N, where N stands generically for the number\nof colors or flavors, in an apparent contradiction with the expected 2 \\pi\nperiodicity in \\theta. We argue that a resolution of this puzzle is related to\nthe existence of a number of different \\theta dependent sectors in a finite\nvolume formulation, which can not be seen in the naive thermodynamic limit V ->\n\\infty. It is shown that, when the limit V -> \\infty is properly defined,\nphysics is always 2 \\pi periodic in \\theta for any integer, and even rational,\nvalues of N, with vacuum doubling at certain values of \\theta. We demonstrate\nthis phenomenon in both the multi-flavor Schwinger model with the bosonization\ntechnique, and four-dimensional gluodynamics with the effective Lagrangian\nmethod. The proposed mechanism works for an arbitrary gauge group.\n", "  We have studied the constraints imposed by the results of neutrino\noscillation experiments on the effective Majorana mass |<m>| that characterizes\nthe contribution of Majorana neutrino masses to the matrix element of\nneutrinoless double-beta decay. We have shown that in a general scheme with\nthree Majorana neutrinos and a hierarchy of neutrino masses (which can be\nexplained by the see-saw mechanism), the results of neutrino oscillation\nexperiments imply rather strong constraints on the parameter |<m>|. From the\nresults of the first reactor long-baseline experiment CHOOZ and the Bugey\nexperiment it follows that |<m>| < 3x10^{-2} eV if the largest mass-squared\ndifference is smaller than 2 eV^2. Hence, we conclude that the observation of\nneutrinoless double-beta decay with a probability that corresponds to |<m>| >\n10^{-1} eV would be a signal for a non-hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum\nand/or non-standard mechanisms of lepton number violation.\n", "  Many of the experiments proposed to look for interference CP violation in\nneutral B mesons concentrate on tagged decay into CP eigenstates. Aleksan,\nDunietz, Kayser and Le Diberder have shown that one can also look for\ninterference CP violation using tagged decays into non-CP eigenstates. In all\nthese methods, one must trace the time dependence of the decays. In this\narticle we discuss a new method to search for interference CP violation by\nusing only time integrated rates into non-CP eigenstates. The method hinges on\nthe comparison between the decays of $\\Upsilon(4S)$ into $f f$, $\\bar{f}\n\\bar{f}$, and $f \\bar{f}$, and also uses the rates for $l^+ f$ and $l^- f$.\nThis method does not depend on how the $\\Upsilon(4S)$ is produced; provided\nenough statistics, one can use both symmetric and asymmetric colliders.\n", "  The construction of a computer code to calculate the cross sections for the\nspin-polarized processes e-gamma=>e-gamma,e-gamma-gamma,e-e+e- to\norder-alpha**3 is described. The code calculates cross sections for\ncircularly-polarized initial-state photons and arbitrarily polarized\ninitial-state electrons. The application of the code to the SLD Compton\npolarimeter indicates that the order-alpha**3 corrections produce a fractional\nshift in the SLC polarization scale of -0.1% which is too small and of the\nwrong sign to account for the discrepancy in the Z-pole asymmetries measured by\nthe SLD Collaboration and the LEP Collaborations.\n", "  In this paper we construct a string-like classical solution, the pion-string,\nin the linear sigma model. We then study the stability of the pion-string, and\nfind that it is unstable in the parameter space allowed experimentally. We also\nspeculate on the existance of an unstable eta-string, associated with\nspontaneous breakdown of the anomalous $U_A(1)$ symmetry in QCD at high\ntemperatures. The implications of the pion and eta strings for cosmology and\nheavy ion collisions are briefly mentioned.\n", "  A generic class of string theories predicts the existence of light moduli\nfields, and they are expected to have masses $m_\\phi$ comparable to the\ngravitino mass $m_{3/2}$ which is in a range of $10^{-2}$keV--1GeV in\ngauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking theories. Such light fields with weak\ninteractions suppressed by the Planck scale can not avoid some stringent\ncosmological constraints, that is, they suffer from `cosmological moduli\nproblems'. We show that all the gravitino mass region $10^{-2}$keV $\\lesssim\nm_{3/2} \\lesssim$ 1GeV is excluded by the constraints even if we incorporate a\nlate-time mini-inflation (thermal inflation). However, a modification of the\noriginal thermal inflation model enables the region $10^{-2}$keV $\\lesssim\nm_{3/2} \\lesssim$ 500keV to survive the constraints. It is also stressed that\nthe moduli can be dark matter in our universe for the mass region $10^{-2}$keV\n$\\lesssim m_\\phi \\lesssim$ 100keV.\n", "  In theories in which the parameters of the low energy theory are not unique,\nperhaps having different values in different domains of the universe as is\npossible in some inflationary models, the fermion masses would be distributed\nwith respect to some weight. In such a situation the specifics of the fermion\nmasses do not have a unique explanation, yet the weight provides the visible\nremnant of the structure of the underlying theory. This paper introduces this\nconcept of a weight for the distribution of masses and provides a quantitative\nestimate of it from the observed quarks and leptons. The weight favors light\nquark masses and appears roughly scale invariant (rho ~ 1/m). Some relevant\nissues, such as the running of the weight with scale and the possible effects\nof anthropic constraints, are also discussed.\n", "  We explain that the generalized vector meson dominance (GVMD) model is\nsuccessful in describing hard high energy processes because it contains\nexpected in QCD Color Coherent Phenomena. Within the model, which reproduces\nBjorken scaling and nuclear shadowing for deep inelastic processes, we\ncalculate $P_{\\gamma}(\\sigma,Q^2)$, the probability for the photon to interact\nwith a target with the cross section $\\sigma$. We find that within the GVMD\nmodel the virtual photon has two main components: the ''hard'' one with the\nsmall cross section of the order of $1/Q^2$ and the high probability and the\n''soft'' one with a typical hadronic cross section with the probability\nsuppressed by the factor of $1/Q^2$. Thus the GVDM model produces\n$P_{\\gamma}(\\sigma,Q^2)$ similar to that within the parton model and suggests\nthe conspiracy between hard and soft QCD at $Q^2 > 1$ GeV$^2$.\n  We study the limit $\\sigma \\to 0$ and show, that $P_{\\gamma}(\\sigma,Q^2)\n\\propto 1/ \\sigma$ in both GVMD model and QCD. Thus similarly to the parton\nmodel the GVMD model predicts the Color Transparency phenomenon. This is an\nindirect indication that Bjorken scaling, Color Transparency and shadowing in\nnuclei in DIS are closely related.\n", "  In models of spontaneously broken supersymmetry, certain light gravitino\nprocesses are governed by the coupling of its Goldstino components. The rules\nfor constructing SUSY and gauge invariant actions involving the Goldstino\ncouplings to matter and gauge fields are presented. The explicit operator\nconstruction is found to be at variance with some previously reported claims. A\nphenomenological consequence arising from light gravitino interactions in\nsupernova is reexamined and scrutinized.\n", "  Effects of four-Fermi-type new interactions are studied in top-quark pair\nproduction and their subsequent decays at future e^+e^- colliders.\nSecondary-lepton-energy distributions are calculated for arbitrary longitudinal\nbeam polarizations. An optimal-observables procedure is applied for the\ndetermination of new parameters.\n", "  We analyze the spin correlations of the top quark pairs produced at Photon\nLinear Colliders. We employ the circular polarized photon beams and general\nspin basis for the top quark pair. We consider general spin bases to find a\nstrong spin correlation between produced top quark and anti-top quark. We show\nthe cross-section in these bases and discuss the characteristics of results.\n", "  The leptonic branching fractions of the tau lepton are sensitive to anomalous\ncharged current interactions. We use recent experimental measurements to\ndetermine the weak charged current magnetic and electric dipole moments and the\nMichel parameter $\\eta$ with unprecedented precision. These results are then\nused to constrain the tau compositeness scale and the allowed parameter space\nfor Higgs doublet models.\n", "  We present the next-to-leading order perturbative QCD prediction to the\nfour-jet angular distributions used by experimental collaborations at LEP for\nmeasuring the QCD color charge factors. We compare our results to ALEPH data\ncorrected to parton level. We perform a leading order ``measurement'' of the\nQCD color factor ratios by fitting the leading order perturbative predictions\nto the next-to-leading order result. Our result shows that in an experimental\nanalysis for measuring the color charge factors the use of the O($\\alpha_s^3$)\nQCD predictions instead of the O($\\alpha_s^2$) results may shift the center of\nthe fit by a relative factor of $1+2\\as$ in the $T_R/C_F$ direction.\n", "  We present new theories of dynamical SUSY breaking in which the strong\ninteractions that break SUSY also give rise to composite quarks and leptons\nwith naturally small Yukawa couplings. In these models, SUSY breaking is\ncommunicated directly to the composite fields without ``messenger''\ninteractions. The compositeness scale can be anywhere between 10 TeV and the\nPlanck scale. These models can naturally solve the supersymmetric flavor\nproblem, and generically predict sfermion mass unification independent from\ngauge unification.\n", "  It has recently been argued that long range forces due to the exchange of\nmassless neutrinos give rise to a very large self-energy in a dense,\nfinite-ranged, weakly-charged medium. Such an effect, if real, would\ndestabilize a neutron star. To address this issue we have studied the related\nproblem of a massless neutrino field in the presence of an external, static\nelectroweak potential of finite range. To be precise, we have computed to one\nloop the exact vacuum energy for the case of a spherical square well potential\nof depth alpha and radius R. For small wells, the vacuum energy is reliably\ndetermined by a perturbative expansion in the external potential. For large\nwells, however, the perturbative expansion breaks down. A manifestation of this\nbreakdown is that the vacuum carries a non-zero neutrino charge. The energy and\nneutrino charge of the ground state are, to a good approximation for large\nwells, those of a neutrino condensate with chemical potential mu=alpha. Our\nresults demonstrate explicitly that long-range forces due to the exchange of\nmassless neutrinos do not threaten the stability of neutron stars.\n", "  A Lagrangean and a set of Feynman rules are presented for non-relativistic\nQFT's with manifest power counting in the heavy particle velocity $v$. A\nr\\'egime is identified in which energies and momenta are of order $Mv$. It is\nneither identical to the ultrasoft r\\'egime corresponding to radiative\nprocesses with energies and momenta of order $Mv^2$, nor to the potential\nr\\'egime with on shell heavy particles and Coulomb binding. In this soft\nr\\'egime, massless particles are on shell, and heavy particle propagators\nbecome static. Examples show that it contributes to one- and two-loop\ncorrections of scattering and production amplitudes near threshold. Hence,\nNRQFT agrees with the results of threshold expansion. A simple example also\ndemonstrates the power of dimensional regularisation in NRQFT.\n", "  We investigate the impact of the intrinsic heavy quark states on the\npredicted values of CP asymmetries in the decays of heavy mesons. It is shown\nthat the intrinsic charm contribution, although dynamically suppressed in QCD,\nis favored by the weak interaction, and therefore it can significantly dilute\nthe predicted values of CP-violating asymmetries. This introduces additional\nnon-perturbative uncertainty into the estimate of direct CP violating effects.\nWe provide a phenomenological estimate of intrinsic charm content of eta and\neta' mesons by expanding various amplitudes in terms of the heavy-light quark\nmixing angle and discuss theoretical uncertainties in the estimates of direct\nCP-violating asymmetries in B -> eta^(') K^(*).\n", "  We generalize a previously proposed renormalization and computation scheme\nfor nonequilibrium dynamics to include finite temperature and one-loop\nselfconsistency as arising in the large-N limit. Since such a scheme amounts\nessentially to tadpole summation, it also includes, at high temperature, the\nhard mass corrections proportional to T^2. We present some numerical examples\nat T=0 and at finite temperature; the results reproduce the essential features\nof other groups. Especially, we can confirm a recently discovered sum rule for\nthe late time behaviour.\n", "  We demonstrate the existence of global monopole and vortex configurations\nwhose core exhibits a phase structure. We determine the critical values of\nparameters for which the transition from the symmetric to the non-symmetric\nphase occurs and discuss the novel dynamics implied by the non-symmetric cores\nfor defect interactions. We model phase transitions in the core of global\nembedded topological defects by identifying the relevant parameters with the\nvacuum expectation value of a dynamical scalar field. Finally, we argue that\nsuperheavy defects that undergo a core phase transition in the very early\nuniverse provide a novel realization for topological inflation.\n", "  Motivated by the experimental measurement of the decay rate, $\\Gamma$, and\nthe longitudinal polarization, $P_L$, in the Cabibbo favored decay $D_s^+\\to\n\\phi {\\rho}^{+}$, we have studied theoretical prediction within the context of\nfactorization approximation invoking several form factors models. We were able\nto obtain agreement with experiment for both $\\Gamma$ and $P_L$ by using\nexperimentally measured values of the form factors $A_1^{D_s\\phi}(0)$,\n$A_2^{D_s\\phi}(0)$ and $V^{D_s\\phi}(0)$ in the semi-leptonic decay $D_s^+\\to\n\\phi l^{+}\\nu_{l}$. We have also included in our calculation the effect of the\nfinal state interaction ($fsi$) by working with the partial waves amplitudes\n$S$, $P$ and $D$. Numerical calculation shows that the decay amplitude is\ndominated by $S$ wave, and that the polarization is sensitive to the\ninterference between $S$ and $D$ waves. The range of the phase difference\n$\\delta_{SD} = \\delta_S - \\delta_D$ accommodated by experimental error in $P_L$\nis large.\n", "  We examine angular distributions of leptons arising from the decay of J/psi\nin inclusive hadroproduction. Taking into account feed-down contributions from\nchi_{1,2}, a flat distribution emerges without fine tuning parameters. Changes\nin the ratio of direct to total J/psi cross sections would change this\ndistribution significantly. Such angular distributions are, therefore,\nconfirmatory tests of the J/psi suppression signal for the production of a\nquark-gluon plasma. Related effects are predicted for the Upsilon.\n", "  We write down the gap equation for the fermion self-energy in a\nfinite-temperature abelian gauge theory in three dimensions. The instantaneous\napproximation is relaxed, momentum-dependent fermion and photon self-energies\nare considered, and the corresponding Schwinger-Dyson equation is solved\nnumerically. The relation between the zero-momentum and zero-temperature\nfermion self-energy and the critical temperature T_c, above which there is no\ndynamical mass generation, is then studied. We also investigate the effect\nwhich the number of fermion flavours N_f has on the results, and we give the\nphase diagram of the theory with respect to T and N_f.\n", "  Rapidity gaps between two hard jets at the Tevatron have been interpreted as\nbeing due to the exchange of two gluons which are in an overall color-singlet\nstate. We show that this simple picture involves unitarity violating\namplitudes. Unitarizing the gluon exchange amplitude leads to qualitatively\ndifferent predictions for the fraction of $t$-channel color singlet exchange\nevents in forward $qq$, $qg$ or $gg$ scattering, which better fit Tevatron\ndata.\n", "  We show that factorization holds for the deeply virtual Compton scattering\namplitude in QCD, up to power suppressed terms, to all orders in perturbation\ntheory. Furthermore, we show that the virtuality of the produced photon does\nnot influence the general theorem.\n", "  A heavy Higgs resonance is described in a representation-independent way\nwhich is valid for the whole energy range of 2 -> 2 scattering processes,\nincluding the asymptotic behavior at low and high energies. The low-energy\ntheorems which follow from to the custodial SU_2 symmetry of the Higgs sector\nrestrict the possible parameterizations of the lineshape that are consistent in\nperturbation theory. Matching conditions are specified which are necessary and\nsufficient to relate the parameters arising in different expansions. The\nconstruction is performed explicitly up to next-to-leading order.\n", "  In string/M-theory with a large compactification radius, some axion-like\nmoduli can be much lighter than the gravitino. Generic moduli in gauge-mediated\nsupersymmetry breaking models also have a mass far below the weak scale.\nMotivated by these, we examine the cosmological implications of light moduli\nfor the mass range from the weak scale to an extremely small scale of order\n10^{-26} eV, and obtain an upper bound on the initial moduli misalignment for\nboth cases with and without a late entropy production.\n", "  Using the results of our recent analysis of e^+e^- annihilation, we plot the\ncurves for the diagonal and transition form factors of light hadrons in the\ntime-like region up to the production threshold of an open charm quantum\nnumber. The comparison with existing data on the decays of J/\\psi into such\nhadrons shows that some new resonance structures may be present in the mass\nrange between 2 GeVand the J/\\psi mass. Searching them may help in a better\nunderstanding of the mass spectrum in both the simple and a more sophisticated\nquark models, and in revealing the details of the three-gluon mechanism of the\nOZI rule breaking in K\\bar K channel.\n", "  Neutral Higgs boson radiative decays of the form h_0, H, A \\to\nf\\bar{f}\\gamma, in the light fermion limit $m_f->0, are calculated in the two\nHiggs doublet model at one-loop level. Comparisons with the calculation within\nthe standard model are given, which indicates that these two models are\ndistinguishable in the decay mode fermion-antifermion -photon. Our results show\nthat the concerned process may stand as an implement to identify the Higgs\nbelongings in case there is a intermediate mass Higgs detected.\n", "  We consider a class of supersymmetric SU(3)\\times SU(2)\\times U(1) multihiggs\nmodels in which R-parity is violated through bilinear Higgs-lepton\ninteractions. The required, due to R-parity violation, higgs-lepton rotations\nintroduce an alternative way to generate the phenomenologically desirable\nfermion mass matrix structures independently of the equality of Yukawas,\npossibly imposed by superstring or other unification.\n", "  CP-violating signals in weak $ \\Xi\\to \\pi \\Lambda$ decay require the\nknowledge of $\\pi \\Lambda$ $S$- and $P$-wave scattering phases at ${m}_{\\Xi}$\ncenter-of-mass energy. We have calculated these phases in baryon chiral\nperturbation theory with the ground-state $\\Sigma$ in $s$ and $u$ channels and\n${{3 \\over 2}}^{+}$ $\\Sigma(1385)$ in the $u$ channel. We do not treat the\nbaryons as heavy. We find ${\\delta}_{S} = {1.2}^{\\circ}$ and ${\\delta}_{P} =\n-{1.7}^{\\circ}$ with the central value of the strong coupling parameter $D$. We\nalso investigate the variation of the scattering phases as functions of the\nparameter $D$. We compare this result with previous calculations, and discuss\nits relevance to CP-asymmetry parameters.\n", "  The two-loop three-gluon vertex is calculated in an arbitrary covariant\ngauge, in the limit when one of the external momenta vanishes. The differential\nWard-Slavnov-Taylor (WST) identity related to this limit is discussed, and the\nrelevant results for the ghost-gluon vertex and two-point functions are\nobtained. Together with the differential WST identity, they provide another\nindependent way for calculating the three-gluon vertex. The renormalization of\nthe results obtained is also presented.\n", "  The complete next-to-next-to-leading order (i.e. $O(v^2)$, $O(v \\alpha_s)$\nand $O(\\alpha_s^2)$) relativistic corrections to the total photon mediated\n$t\\bar t$ production cross section at threshold are presented in the framework\nof nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics. The results are obtained using\nsemi-analytic methods and ``direct matching''. The size of the\nnext-to-next-to-leading order relativistic corrections is found to be\ncomparable to the size of the next-to-leading order ones.\n", "  We consider the three-loop singlet diagrams induced by axial-vector, scalar\nand pseudo-scalar currents. Expansions for small and large external momentum\n$q$ are presented. They are used in combination with conformal mapping and\nPad\\'e approximations in order to arrive at results for the polarization\nfunctions valid for all $q^2$. Results are presented for the imaginary parts\nwhich are directly related to physical quantities like the production of top\nquarks or the decay of scalar or pseudo-scalar Higgs bosons.\n", "  We calculate numerically the electrical conductivity $\\sigma$, heat\nconductivity $\\kappa$ and shear viscosity $\\eta$ of the hot plasma present in\nthe early universe for the temperature interval $1\\MeV\\lsim T\\lsim 10\\GeV$. We\nuse the Boltzmann collision equation to compute all the scattering matrix\nelements and regulate them by the thermal masses of the $t$- and $u$-channel\nparticles. No leading order approximation is needed because of the numerical\nintegration routines used.\n", "  We present a calculation of the renormalized HQET Lagrangian at order\nO(1/m_Q^3) in the one particle sector. The anomalous dimensions of local\noperators and time ordered products of dimension 7 contributing at this order\nare calculated in the one loop approximation. We show that a careful treatment\nof the time ordered products is necessary to arrive at a gauge independent\nrenormalized lagrangian. Our result sets the stage for an investigation of\nreparametrization invariance at O(1/m_Q^3).\n", "  The uncertainty in the calculation of many important new processes at the\nTevatron and LHC is dominated by that concerning the gluon distribution\nfunction. We investigate the uncertainty in the gluon distribution of the\nproton by systematically varying the gluon parameters in the global QCD\nanalysis of parton distributions. The results depend critically on the parton\nmomentum fraction x and the QCD scale Q^2. The uncertainties are presented for\nintegrated gluon-gluon and gluon-quark luminosities for both the Tevatron and\nLHC as a function of sqrt(tau)=sqrt(x1x2)=sqrt(shat/s), the most relevant\nquantity for new particle production. The uncertainties are reasonably small,\nexcept for large x.\n", "  We show that in large-field inflationary scenarios, superheavy (many orders\nof magnitude larger than the weak scale) dark matter will be produced in\ncosmologically interesting quantities if superheavy stable particles exist in\nthe mass spectrum. We show that these particles may be produced naturally\nduring the transition from the inflationary phase to either a matter-dominated\nor radiation-dominated phase as a result of the expansion of the background\nspacetime acting on vacuum quantum fluctuations of the dark matter field. We\nfind that as long as there are stable particles whose mass is of the order of\nthe inflaton mass (presumably around $10^{13}$GeV), they will be produced in\nsufficient abundance to give $\\Omega_0 =1$ quite independently of any details\nof the non-gravitational interactions of the dark-matter field.\n", "  We consider the sneutrino resonance reaction l^+ l^- -> sneutrino -> tau^+\ntau^- in the MSSM without R-parity. We introduce new CP-violating and\nCP-conserving tau-spin asymmetries which are generated already at the\ntree-level if there is sneutrino - sneutrino-bar mixing and that are forbidden\nin the SM. It is remarkable that these spin asymmetries can reach ~75% around\nresonance for a sneutrino mass splitting of \\Delta m ~ \\Gamma and ~10% for a\nsplitting as low as \\Delta m ~ 0.1\\Gamma, where \\Gamma is the sneutrino width.\nWe show that they are easily detectable already at LEP2 so long as the beam\nenergy is within ~10 GeV range around the muon-sneutrino masses and may\ntherefore serve as extremely powerful probes of sneutrino mixing phenomena.\n", "  We establish a self-consistent variational framework that allows us to study\nnumerically the non-equilibrium evolution of non-perturbative inhomogeneous\nfield configurations including quantum backreaction effects. After discussing\nthe practical merits and disadvantages of different approaches we provide a\nclosed set of local and renormalizable update equations that determine the\ndynamical evolution of inhomogeneous condensates and can be implemented\nnumerically. These incorporate self-consistently the backreaction of quantum\nfluctuations and particle production. This program requires the solution of a\nself-consistent inhomogeneous problem to provide initial Cauchy data for the\ninhomogeneous condensates and Green's functions. We provide a simple solvable\nansatz for such an initial value problem for the Sine-Gordon and phi^4 quantum\nfield theories in one spatial dimension. We compare exact known results of the\nSine Gordon model to this simple ansatz. We also study the linear sigma model\nin the large N limit in three spatial dimensions as a microscopic model for\npion production in ultrarelativistic collisions. We provide a solvable self-\nconsistent ansatz for the initial value problem with cylindrical symmetry. For\nthis case we also obtain a closed set of local and renormalized update\nequations that can be numerically implemented. A novel phenomenon of spinodal\ninstabilities and pion production arises as a result of a Klein paradox for\nlarge amplitude inhomogeneous condensate configurations.\n", "  We obtain analytical formulae for the cross section and the angular\ndistributions of the b(bbar) quarks in the process e+e- -> t tbar, with t -> W+\nb (tbar -> W- bbar) assuming CP violation in the \\gamma t tbar and Z t tbar\nvertices. We present CP violating asymmetries, which measure separately the\nreal and imaginary parts of the electroweak dipole moment form factors of the\ntop, d^{\\gamma}(s) and d^{Z}(s). We give a numerical analysis of these\nasymmetries within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with complex\nparameters. They turn out to be of order <= 10^{-3}.\n", "  A topological term related to the number of self-intersections of the string\nworld-sheet is shown to emerge in the string representation of the Wilson loop\nin the dilute instanton gas. The coupling constant of this term occurs to be\nproportional to the topological charge of the instanton gas under\nconsideration.\n", "  We consider the unconventional way to interpret the current data on solar\nneutrino oscillations as derived recently by Halprin and Leung from a string\nmodel based on the existence of the string dilaton field which remains massless\nin the low-energy world. The equivalence principle violation entailed by the\nexistence of a massless dilaton may then produce neutrino oscillations even for\nneutrinos that are degenerate in mass. Here we calculate the medium-induced\nmass squared difference for solar neutrinos, which is due to their coherent\ninteractions with the cosmic neutrino background and with solar plasma\nconstituents. We show that this difference can naturally be large enough to\nsatisfy the known experimental limits on the Just So solution as well as on the\nMSW solution of the solar neutrino problem.\n", "  The effect of multibody massless neutrino exchanges between neutrons inside a\nfinite-size neutron star is studied. We use an effective Lagrangian, which\nincorporates the effect of the neutrons on the neutrinos. Following Schwinger,\nit is shown that the total interaction energy density is computed by comparing\nthe zero point energy of the neutrino sea with and without the star. It has\nalready been shown that in an infinite-size star the total energy due to\nneutrino exchange vanishes exactly. The opposite claim that massless neutrino\nexchange would produce a huge energy is due to an improper summation of an\ninfrared-divergent quantity. The same vanishing of the total energy has been\nproved exactly in the case of a finite star in a one-dimensional toy model.\n  Here we study the three-dimensional case. We first consider the effect of a\nsharp star border, assumed to be a plane. We find that there is a non-\nvanishing of the zero point energy density difference between the inside and\nthe outside due to the refraction index at the border and the consequent\nnon-penetrating waves. An analytical and numerical calculation for the case of\na spherical star with a sharp border confirms that the preceding border effect\nis the dominant one. The total result is shown to be infrared-safe, thus\nconfirming that there is no need to assume a neutrino mass. The ultraviolet\ncut-offs, which correspond in some sense to the matching of the effective\ntheory with the exact one, are discussed. Finally the energy due to long\ndistance neutrino exchange is of the order of $10^{-8} -- 10^{-13} GeV per\nneutron$, i.e. negligible with respect to the neutron mass density.\n", "  We propose a new eta-eta' mixing scheme where we start from the quark flavor\nbasis and assume that the decay constants in that basis follow the pattern of\nparticle state mixing. On exploiting the divergences of the axial vector\ncurrents - which embody the axial vector anomaly - all basic parameters are\nfixed to first order of flavor symmetry breaking. That approach naturally leads\nto a mass matrix, quadratic in the masses, with specified elements. We also\ntest our mixing scheme against experiment and determine corrections to the\nfirst order values of the basic parameters from phenomenology. Finally, we\ngeneralize the mixing scheme to include the eta(c). Again the divergences of\nthe axial vector currents fix the mass matrix and, hence, mixing angles and the\ncharm content of the eta and eta'.\n", "  The finite temperature effective potential in the 2+1 dimensional\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio model is constructed up to the next to leading order in the\nlarge $N$ expansion, where $N$ is the number of flavors in the model. The\ndistinctive feature of the analysis is an inclusion of an additional scalar\nfield, which allows us to circumvent the well known, and otherwise unavoidable\nproblem with the imaginary contribution to the effective potential. In\naccordance with the Mermin-Wagner-Coleman theorem, applied to the dimensionally\nreduced subsystem of the zero Matsubara modes of the composite boson fields,\nthe finite temperature effective potential reveals a global minimum at the zero\nof the composite order parameter. This allows us to conclude that the\ncontinuous global symmetry of the NJL model is not broken for any arbitrarily\nsmall, finite temperature.\n", "  We study the formation of domains in a continuous phase transition with a\nfinite-temperature quench. The model treated is the $\\Phi^4$ theory in two\nspatial dimensions with global O(2) symmetry. We investigate this using\nreal-time thermal field theory, following Boyanovsky and collaborators, and\nfind that domain sizes appear to be smaller than those produced in an\ninstantaneous quench in the tree-level approximation. We also propose that a\nmore physical picture emerges by examining the two-point functions which do not\ninvolve any cutoff on the short wavelength Goldstone modes.\n", "  In this letter we focus on the calculation of $f_{\\eta'}^{(c)},$ the\namplitude of the $ (c\\bar{c}) \\to (gluons) \\to \\eta^{'}$ transition, which\nprovides the magnitude of the contribution of the Cabbibo favored $b \\to \\bar c\nc s$ elementary process to $B \\to \\eta ' K$ decay. It is found that $f_{\\eta\n'}^{(c)} = - 12.3\\sim -18.4 MeV$ on the scale of $m_{c}.$ This number is in\nstrong contradiction with the estimations of Halperin, Zhitnitsky and Shuryak,\nZhitnitsky but almost in agreement with phenomenological analysis of Feldman et\nal.,\n  Petrov and the estimations of Ali et al.\n", "  We argue that the observation of a sizable direct CP asymmetry A_{CP} in the\ninclusive decays B -> X_s gamma would be a clean signal of New Physics. In the\nStandard Model, A_{CP} can be calculated reliably and is found to be below 1%\nin magnitude. In extensions of the Standard Model with new CP-violating\ncouplings, large CP asymmetries are possible without conflicting with the\nexperimental value of the branching ratio for the decays B -> X_s gamma. In\nparticular, large asymmetries arise naturally in models with enhanced\nchromo-magnetic dipole operators. Some generic examples of such models are\nexplored and their implications for the semileptonic branching ratio and charm\nyield in B decays discussed.\n", "  We apply a generalized spin-basis analysis to associated Higgs production and\ngauge boson pair production at LEP. This framework allows us to identify a\nchoice of spin axes for the processes e+ e- --> ZH,ZZ which leads to strikingly\ndifferent correlations among the decay products, even well above threshold.\nThis spin basis optimizes the difference in the angular correlations for these\ntwo processes. In contrast, the same distributions display little contrast when\nthe helicity basis is used. We also apply this technique to the case of W boson\npair production.\n", "  We show that the decaying magnetohydrodynamic turbulence leads to a more\nrapid growth of the correlation length of a primordial magnetic field than that\ncaused by the expansion of the Universe. As an example, we consider the\nmagnetic fields created during the electroweak phase transition. The expansion\nof the universe alone would yield a correlation length at the present epoch of\n1 AU, whereas we find that the correlation length is likely of order 100 AU,\nand cannot possibly be longer than $10^4$ AU for non-helical fields. If the\nprimordial field is strongly helical, the correlation length can be much\nlarger, but we show that even in this case it cannot exceed 100 pc. All these\nestimates make it hard to believe that the observed galactic magnetic fields\ncan result from the amplification of seed fields generated at the electroweak\nphase transition by the standard galactic dynamo.\n", "  The energy spectra of the b and bbar quarks in e+e- -> t tbar with t -> b W\n(tbar -> bbar W) are calculated assuming CP violation in the production\nprocess. Expressions for the corresponding CP violating asymmetries and optimal\nobservables that determine the imaginary parts of the electric and weak dipole\nmoment form factors of the top are derived. It is shown that polarization of\nthe initial lepton beams is essential to disentangle Im d^{\\gamma}(s) and Im\nd^{Z}(s). Numerical results are given in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard\nModel with complex phases.\n", "  We calculate the inclusive branching ratio for B--> X_s gamma, the inclusive\nbranching ratios and asymmetries for B--> X_s l+ l- and the anomalous magnetic\nmoment g-2 of the muon, within a minimal gauge-mediated SUSY-breaking model\nwhich naturally generates a large ratio tan(beta) of Higgs field vacuum\nexpectation values. These predictions are highly correlated with each other,\ndepending on only two fundamental parameters: the superpartner mass scale and\nthe logarithm of a common messenger mass. The predictions for B--> X_s gamma\ndecay and g-2 are in somewhat better agreement with current experiments than\nthe standard model, but a much sharper comparison will soon be possible using\nnew measurements now in progress or under analysis. Moreover we predict large\ndeviations in B--> X_s e+ e- and B--> X_s mu+ mu- asymmetries, and somewhat\nsmaller ones in B--> X_s e+ e- and B--> X_s tau+ tau- branching ratios, which\nwill be detectable in hadronic colliders.\n", "  Nonfactorizable effects in hadronic charmless B -> PP, VP decays can be\nparametrized in terms of the effective number of colors N_c in the effective\nparameters $a_i^{eff}$ that are linear combinations of Wilson coefficients. It\nis shown that N_c(V+A) in the penguin amplitudes induced by the (V-A)(V+A)\nfour-quark operators is different from N_c(V-A) in the decay amplitudes arising\nfrom the (V-A)(V-A) operators. Central values of the branching ratios of\n$B^\\pm\\to\\omega \\pi^\\pm$ and $B\\to\\pi\\pi$ decays favor $N_c(V-A)\\approx 2$, in\naccordance with the nonfactorizable effect observed in $B\\to D^{(*)}\\pi\n(\\rho)$. Measurements of the interference effects in $B^-\\to\\pi^-(\\rho^-)\\pi^0\n(\\rho^0)$ decays will provide a more decisive test on the parameter N_c(V-A).\nHowever, $N_c(V+A)\\sim 2$ is ruled out by $B^\\pm\\to\\phi K^\\pm$ and $B\\to\\phi\nK^*$. We find that N_c(V+A) lies in the range $10\\geq N_c(V+A)\\geq 4.3$,\nsubject to the corrections from W-annihilation and space-like penguin effects.\nWith $N_c(V-A)\\approx 2$ we show that the branching ratio of $B\\to\\eta' K$ is\nenhanced considerably at small values of 1/N_c(V+A) so that it is compatible\nwith experiment. In particular, the measurement of $B^0\\to\\eta' K^0$ is now\nwell explained without resorting to any new mechanism or new physics beyond the\nStandard Model. Finally, we point out that it is difficult to understand the\nobserved large branching ratio of $B^\\pm\\to\\omega K^\\pm$ within the present\nframework. Inelastic final-state interactions may alleviate the difficulty with\nthis decay mode.\n", "  The speed of cool pions in the chiral limit is analytically computed at low\ntemperature within the imaginary time formalism to two loop order. This\nevaluation shows a logarithmic dependence in the temperature where the scale\nwithin the logarithm is very large compared to the pion decay constant.\n", "  The pole mass of a heavy quark is ambiguous by an amount of order\n$\\Lambda_{QCD}$. We show that the heavy-quark potential, $V(r)$, is similarly\nambiguous, but that the total static energy, $2M_{pole}+V(r)$, is unambiguous\nwhen expressed in terms of a short-distance mass. This implies that the\nextraction of a short-distance mass from the quarkonium spectrum is free of an\nambiguity of order $\\Lambda_{QCD}$, in contrast with the pole mass.\n", "  In deeply inelastic lepton-nucleus scattering (DIS), the average jet\ntransverse momentum is broadened because of the multiple scattering in the\nnuclear medium. The size of jet broadening is proportional to the multi-parton\ncorrelation functions inside nuclei. We show that at leading order, jet\nbroadening in DIS and nulcear enhancement in di-jet momentum imbalance and\nDrell-Yan $< q_T^2 > $ share the same four-parton correlation functions. We\nargue that jet broadening in DIS provide an indenpendent measurement of the\nfour-parton correlation functions and a test of QCD treatment of multiple\nscattering.\n", "  We discuss dilaton and Moduli dominant SUSY breaking scenarios in M-theory.\nIn addition, for the nonperturbative superpotential from gaugino condensation,\nwe discuss the soft terms in the simplest model (only S and T moduli fields)\nand in the $T^6/Z_{12}$ model from M-theory. From the phenomenology\nconsideration, we suggest massless scalar SUSY breaking scenario.\n", "  We study the production of charmonium hybrids in B decays. We use the\noperator product expansion and nonrelativistic QCD to organize the various\ncontributions to this process. We express the decay rate in terms of a few\nmatrix elements which eventually will be fixed by experimental measurements or\ncalculated on the lattice. While the Fock state expansion is problematic for\nhybrids, in that there is no perturbative large mass limit, the operator\nproduct expansion still provides a model independent framework for\nphenomenological calculations of hybrid production and decay. We then use a\nsimple flux tube model to estimate the branching ratio B -> psi_g + X, where\npsi_g is a J^{PC}=0^{+-} hybrid, the large production of which could help\nresolve the low charm multiplicity and semileptonic branching ratio observed in\nB decays. We also investigate the possible contributions of tensor charmonium\nproduction. We observe that it is unlikely for either effect to be large enough\nto play a significant role in resolving these problems.\n", "  The sliding singlet mechanism is one of the most interesting solutions of the\ntriplet-doublet splitting problem. We analyze this mechanism in the gauge\nmediated supersymmetry breaking scenario. We show that the sliding singlet\nmechanism does not work in the naive gauge mediation scenario because of the\nsinglet linear terms derived from the gravity, although $F$ term is much\nsmaller than the one in the gravity mediation scenario. We also consider the\nextension in order for the sliding singlet mechanism to work.\n", "  Lepton flavour violation has been proposed as a significant test of\nsupersymmetric unification. Here we show that such signals are also a generic\nfeature of supersymmetric string unified models in which there is no simple\nunified gauge group. In realistic models of this kind which involve third\nfamily Yukawa unification and large values of $\\tan \\beta$, there are generally\nheavy right-handed (singlet) neutrinos of intermediate mass $M_{\\nu}$, whose\ncouplings violate lepton flavour. To illustrate these effects we calculate the\nrates for $\\mu \\to e \\gamma$ and $\\tau \\to \\mu gamma$ in the minimal\nsupersymmetric $SU(4)\\times SU(2)\\times SU(2)$ model. Including only the\nminimum irreducible contributions, we find that both rates are enhanced\nrelative to similar models with low $\\tan \\beta$, with $\\tau \\to \\mu gamma$\nproviding a decisive test of such models in the near future.\n", "  We show that the next-to-leading corrections to the kernel of the gap\nequation can be large and of opposite sign to the lowest order kernel, in the\npresence of a gauge boson mass. This calls into question the reliability of the\nMost Attractive Channel hypothesis.\n", "  We discuss a supersymmetric grand unified model which has gauge group SU(5)\n$\\times$ SU(5) $\\times$ SU(5), with matter fields transforming asymmetrically\nunder different gauge SU(5) groups. We observe that the gauge structure of the\nmodel leads to approximate texture zero structures in fermion mass matrices and\na natural hierarchy in the Yukawa couplings. The proton lifetime is estimated\nto be larger than $10^{34}$ years in this model. As in more conventional\nsupersymmetric GUT models with product gauge groups, this model possesses no\ntensor fields with rank higher than 2, so that it might arise from a level 1\nstring construction.\n", "  Supersymmetric extensions of the standard model generically contain\nadditional sources of CP violation. We discuss how at one loop a potentially\nlarge CP violating coupling of the lightest Higgs, h^0, to leptons is induced\nin the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). The CP violating couplings\nof h^0 in extensions of the MSSM, such as the next-to-minimal supersymmetric\nstandard model (NMSSM) are also considered. We indicate how this CP violation\nmight be observed; in particular a polarization-dependent production asymmetry,\nin the context of a muon collider, provides a means to access this coupling\ncleanly. In the MSSM, existing limits on the electric dipole moment (EDM) of\nthe electron, coupled with standard universality assumptions, severly\nconstrains any such signal. Nevertheless, extensions of the MSSM, such as the\nNMSSM, allow CP-violating signals as large as 100%.\n", "  It is shown that at collider energies experimental multiplicity distributions\nare well parameterized by a sum of Gupta-Sarma distributions. This extends\nearlier description of the lower energy data by the two parameter sum of\nPoissonians. Implications of the proposed parametrization for LHC are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We numerically investigate the decay, via parametric resonance, of the\ninflaton with an m^2 phi^2 potential into a scalar matter field with a symmetry\nbreaking potential. We consider the case where symmetry breaking takes place\nduring inflation. We show that when expansion is not taken into account\nsymmetry restoration and non-thermal defect production during reheating is\npossible. However in an expanding universe the fields do not spend sufficient\ntime in the instability bands; thus symmetry restoration and subsequent domain\nwall production do not occur.\n", "  Dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry in effective models of QCD is studied.\nIntroducing a cut-off function or a non-local interaction, the Noether current\nmust be modified and thus the Ward-Takahashi identity and the PCAC relation are\nmodified accordingly. We point out that the pion decay constant must be defined\nconsistently with the Noether current so that the low-energy relations are\nsatisfied. We define the proxy of the Noether current for general effective\nmodels, which is consistent with loop expansion of the\nCornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective action. A general formula for the pion\ndecay constant in terms of the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude is derived.\n  The effective Pagels-Stokar formula is proposed which is useful to estimate\nthe decay constant without solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation.\n", "  We present details for a method to compute the broken phase sphaleron rate\n(rate of hot baryon number violation below the electroweak phase transition)\nnonperturbatively, using a combination of multicanonical and real time lattice\ntechniques. The calculation includes the ``dynamical prefactor,'' which\naccounts for prompt recrossings of the sphaleron barrier. The prefactor depends\non the hard thermal loops, getting smaller with increasing Debye mass; but for\nrealistic Debye masses the effect is not large. The baryon number erasure rate\nin the broken phase is slower than a perturbative estimate by about exp(-3.6).\nAssuming the electroweak phase transition has enough latent heat to reheat the\nuniverse to the equilibrium temperature, baryon number is preserved after the\nphase transition if the ratio of (``dimensionally reduced'' thermal) scalar to\ngauge couplings (lambda / g^2) is less than .037.\n", "  There are many theoretical reasons why heavy quasi-stable charged particles\nmight exist. Pair production of such particles at the Tevatron can produce\nhighly ionizing tracks (HITs) or fake muons. In gauge-mediated supersymmetry\nbreaking, sparticle production can lead to events with a pair of quasi-stable\nsleptons, a significant fraction of which will have the same electric charge.\nDepending on the production mechanism and the decay chain, they may also be\naccompanied by additional energetic leptons. We study the relative importance\nof the resulting signals for the Tevatron Run II. The relative fraction of\nsame-sign tracks to other background-free signals is an important diagnostic\ntool in gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking that may provide information\nabout mass splittings, tan(beta) and the number of messengers communicating\nsupersymmetry breaking.\n", "  In a medium that contains electrons but not the other charged leptons, such\nas normal matter, the gravitational interactions of neutrinos are not the same\nfor all the neutrino flavors. We calculate the leading order matter-induced\ncorrections to the neutrino gravitational interactions in such a medium and\nconsider some of their physical implications.\n", "  Using a modified perturbative approach that includes the Sudakov resummation\nand transverse degrees of freedom we analyze the penguin-induced $B^{-} \\to\n\\pi^{-}\\phi$ decay by applying the next-to-leading order effective weak\nHamiltonian. The modified perturbative method enables us to include\nnonfactorizable contributions and to control virtual momenta appearing in the\nprocess. Besides, we apply the three-scale factorization theorem for\nnonleptonic processes that offers the possibility of having the\nscale-independent product of short- and long-distance parts in the amplitude of\nthe weak Hamiltonian. The calculation supports the results obtained in the BSW\nfactorization approach, illustrating the electroweak penguin dominance and the\nbranching ratio of order ${\\cal O}(10^{-8})$. However, the estimated prediction\nof 16% for the CP asymmetry is much larger than that obtained in the\nfactorization approach.\n", "  We present estimates of the direct (in decay amplitudes) and indirect\n(mixing- induced) CP-violating asymmetries in the non-leptonic charmless\ntwo-body decay rates for $B \\to PP$, $B \\to PV$ and $B \\to VV$ decays and their\ncharged conjugates, where P(V) is a light pseudoscalar (vector) meson. These\nestimates are based on a generalized factorization approach making use of\nnext-to-leading order perturbative QCD contributions which generate the\nrequired strong phases. No soft final state interactions are included. We study\nthe dependence of the asymmetries on a number of input parameters and show that\nthere are at least two (possibly three) classes of decays in which the\nasymmetries are parametrically stable in this approach. The decay modes of\nparticular interest are: $\\optbar{B^0} \\to \\pi^+ \\pi^-$, $\\optbar{B^0} \\to\nK_S^0 \\pi^0$, $\\optbar{B^0} \\to K_S^0 \\eta^\\prime$, $\\optbar{B^0} \\to K_S^0\n\\eta$ and $\\optbar{B^0} \\to \\rho^+ \\rho^-$. Likewise, the CP-violating\nasymmetry in the decays $\\optbar{B^0} \\to K_S^0 h^0$ with $h^0=\\pi^0,K_S^0,\n\\eta,\\eta^\\prime$ is found to be parametrically stable and large. Measurements\nof these asymmetries will lead to a determination of the phases $\\sin 2\\alpha$\nand $\\sin 2 \\beta$ and we work out the relationships in these modes in the\npresent theoretical framework. We also show the extent of the so-called\n\"penguin pollution\" in the rate asymmetry $A_{CP}(\\pi^+ \\pi^-)$ and of the\n\"tree shadow\" in the asymmetry $A_{CP}(K_S^0\\eta^\\prime)$ which will effect the\ndetermination of $\\sin 2 \\alpha$ and $\\sin 2 \\beta$ from the respective\nmeasurements. CP-violating asymmetries in $B^\\pm \\to \\pi^\\pm \\eta^\\prime$,\n$B^\\pm \\to K^{*\\pm} \\eta$, $B^\\pm \\to K^{*\\pm} \\eta^\\prime$ and $B^\\pm \\to\nK^{*\\pm}\\rho^0$ are potentially interesting and are studied here.\n", "  We present the first complete results for the semileptonic and rare radiative\nform factors of B-mesons weak decay into a light vector-meson (rho, omega, K*,\nphi) in the light-cone sum-rule approach. The calculation includes radiative\ncorrections, higher-twist corrections and SU(3)-breaking effects. The\ntheoretical uncertainty is investigated in detail. A simple parametrization of\nthe form factors is given in terms of three parameters each. We find that the\nform factors observe several relations inspired by heavy-quark symmetry.\n", "  Using dispersion theoretic techniques, we consider coherent long range forces\narising from double pseudoscalar exchange among fermions. We find that Yukawa\ntype coupling leads to $1/r^3$ spin independent attractive potentials whereas\nderivative coupling renders $1/r^5$ spin independent repulsive potentials.\n", "  We introduce and study the properties of the \"color-straight\" four-quark\noperators containing heavy and light quark fields. They are of the form (\\bar\nb\\Gamma_b b)(\\bar q\\Gamma_q q) where both brackets are color singlets. Their\nexpectation values include the bulk of the nonfactorizable contributions to the\nnonleptonic decay widths of heavy hadrons. The expectation values of the\ncolor-straight operators in the heavy hadrons are related to the momentum\nintegrals of the elastic light-quark formfactors of the respective heavy\nhadron. We calculate the asymptotic behavior of the light-current formfactors\nof heavy hadrons and show that the actual decrease is 1/(q^2)^3/2 rather than\n1/q^4. The two-loop hybrid anomalous dimensions of the four-quark operators and\ntheir mixing (absent in the first loop) are obtained. Using plausible models\nfor the elastic formfactors, we estimate the expectation values of the\ncolor-straight operators in the heavy mesons and baryons. Improved estimates\nwill be possible in the future with new data on the radiative decays of heavy\nhadrons. We give the Wilson coefficients of the four-fermion operators in the\n1/m_b expansion of the inclusive widths and discuss the numerical predictions.\nEstimates of the nonfactorizable expectation values are given.\n", "  We complete the one loop renormalization of the HQET lagrangian at O(1/m_Q^3)\nincluding four fermion operators with two heavy and two light quark fields in\nthe operator basis. It is shown that as a consequence the short distance\ncoefficients of the operators bilinear in the heavy quark field receive\nnontrivial corrections.\n", "  Recently, we have introduced a unified theory to deal with perturbative and\nnon-perturbative QCD contributions to hadronic structure functions in deep\ninelastic scattering. This formulation is realized by combining the coordinate\nspace approach based on light-front current algebra techniques and the momentum\nspace approach based on Fock space expansion methods in the Hamiltonian\nformalism of light-front field theory. In this work we show how a perturbative\nanalysis in the light-front Hamiltonian formalism leads to the factorization\nscheme we have proposed recently. The analysis also shows that the scaling\nviolations due to perturbative QCD corrections can be rather easily addressed\nin this framework by simply replacing the hadron target by dressed parton\ntarget and then carrying out a systematic expansion in the coupling constant\n$\\alpha_s$ based on the perturbative QCD expansion of the dressed parton\ntarget. The tools employed for this calculation are those available from\nlight-front old-fashioned perturbation theory. We present the complete set of\ncalculations of unpolarized and polarized deep inelastic structure functions to\norder $\\alpha_s$. We extract the relevant splitting functions in all the cases.\nWe explicitly verify all the sum rules to order $\\alpha_s$. We demonstrate the\nvalidity of approximations made in the derivation of the new factorization\nscheme. This is achieved with the help of detailed calculations of the\nevolution of structure function of a composite system carried out using\nmulti-parton wavefunctions.\n", "  We study the dynamics of relaxation and thermalization in an exactly solvable\nmodel with the goal of understanding the effects of off-shell processes. The\nfocus is to compare the exact evolution of the distribution function with\ndifferent approximations to the relaxational dynamics: Boltzmann, non-Markovian\nand Markovian quantum kinetics. The time evolution of the distribution function\nis evaluated exactly using two methods: time evolution of an initially prepared\ndensity matrix and by solving the Heisenberg equations of motion. There are two\ndifferent cases that are studied in detail: i) no stable particle states below\nthreshold of the bath and a quasiparticle resonance above it and ii) a stable\ndiscrete exact `particle' state below threshold. For the case of quasiparticles\nin the continuum (resonances) the exact quasiparticle distribution\nasymptotically tends to a statistical equilibrium distribution that differs\nfrom a simple Bose-Einstein form as a result of off-shell processes. In the\ncase ii), the distribution of particles does not thermalize with the bath. We\nstudy the kinetics of thermalization and relaxation by deriving a non-Markovian\nquantum kinetic equation which resums the perturbative series and includes\noff-shell effects. A Markovian approximation that includes off-shell\ncontributions and the usual Boltzmann equation are obtained from the quantum\nkinetic equation in the limit of wide separation of time scales upon different\ncoarse-graining assumptions. The relaxational dynamics predicted by the\nnon-Markovian, Markovian and Boltzmann approximations are compared to the exact\nresult of the model. The Boltzmann approach is seen to fail in the case of wide\nresonances and when threshold and renormalization effects are important.\n", "  We assume universal values for the color-singlet ($\\epsilon_1$) and color\noctet ($\\epsilon_8$) nonfactorization parameters in B Decays. Two sets of\ncolor-favored processes and one set of color-suppressed processes were used to\ngive quantitative estimates of these parameters. It has been found (by\ncalculating the branching ratios for a large number of Cabibbo-favored B\nDecays) that the values $\\epsilon_1(\\mu_0) = - 0.06 +/- 0.03$ and\n$\\epsilon_8(\\mu_0) = 0.12 +/- 0.02$ improve significantly the predictions of\nthe factorization model.\n", "  Ordinary technicolor and extended technicolor cannot produce the heavy top\nquark unaided. We demonstrate that a flavor-universal extension of the color\ninteractions combined with an extended hypercharge sector that singles out the\nthird generation can provide the necessary assistance. We discuss current\nexperimental constraints and suggest how collider experiments can search for\nthe predicted new heavy gauge bosons.\n", "  Neutrino telescopes of kilometer size are currently being planned. They will\nbe two or three orders of magnitude bigger than presently operating detectors,\nbut they will have a much higher muon energy threshold. We discuss the\ntrade-off between area and energy threshold for indirect detection of\nneutralino dark matter captured in the Sun and in the Earth and annihilating\ninto high energy neutrinos. We also study the effect of a higher threshold on\nthe complementarity of different searches for supersymmetric dark matter.\n", "  The interpretation of Drell-Yan production in terms of the antiquark\ndensities depends on NLO corrections. Besides the NLO corrections to the\nfamiliar annihilation $q\\bar{q}\\to \\gamma^* \\to l^+ l^-$, there is a\nsubstantial contribution from the QCD Compton subprocesses $gq \\to q\\gamma^*\n\\to q l^+ l^-$ and $g\\bar{q} \\to q\\gamma^* \\to q l^+ l^-$. The beam and target\ndependence of the two classes of corrections is different. We discuss the\nimpact of this difference on the determination of the $\\bar{d}-\\bar{u}$\nasymmetry in the proton from the comparison of the $pp$ and $pn$ Drell-Yan\nproduction.\n", "  We calculate the spin density matrix of top quark pairs for the reaction\n$e^+e^-\\to t\\bar{t}X$ to order $\\alpha_s$. As an application we show\nnext-to-leading order results for a variety of spin observables for the\n$t\\bar{t}$ system. These include the top quark and antiquark polarizations and\n$t\\bar{t}$ spin-spin correlations as a function of the center-of-mass energy\nand of the top quark scattering angle for arbitrary longitudinal polarization\nof the electron/positron beam.\n", "  Core-collapse supernovae emit of order $10^{58}$ neutrinos and antineutrinos\nof all flavors over several seconds, with average energies of 10--25 MeV. In\nthe Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO), which begins operations this year,\nneutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors can be detected by reactions which\nbreak up the deuteron. For a future Galactic supernova at a distance of 10 kpc,\nseveral hundred events will be observed in SNO. The $\\nu_\\mu$ and $\\nu_\\tau$\nneutrinos and antineutrinos are of particular interest, as a test of the\nsupernova mechanism. In addition, it is possible to measure or limit their\nmasses by their delay (determined from neutral-current events) relative to the\n$\\bar{\\nu}_e$ neutrinos (determined from charged-current events). Numerical\nresults are presented for such a future supernova as seen in SNO. Under\nreasonable assumptions, and in the presence of the expected counting\nstatistics, a $\\nu_\\mu$ or $\\nu_\\tau$ mass down to about 30 eV can be simply\nand robustly determined. If zero delay is measured, then the mass limit is\nindependent of the distance $D$. At present, this seems to be the best\npossibility for direct determination of a $\\nu_\\mu$ or $\\nu_\\tau$ mass within\nthe cosmologically interesting range. We also show how to separately study the\nsupernova and neutrino physics, and how changes in the assumed supernova\nparameters would affect the mass sensitivity.\n", "  A model of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking is constructed in which the\nlow-energy physics depends on a single dynamical scale. Strong coupling\ndynamics of gauge theories plays an important role, in particular through its\neffects on beta functions and through confinement. The model does not have\ndistinct messenger and supersymmetry-breaking sectors. The scale of\nsupersymmetry breaking is of order 10-100 \\TeV, implying that the decay of the\nnext-to-lightest superpartner into the gravitino is prompt. Superoblique\ncorrections are enhanced. A Dirac fermion and one complex scalar, in a 10 or\n\\bar{10} of (global) SU(5), are predicted to be relatively light and to satisfy\ncertain mass relations with the standard model squarks and sleptons.\n", "  Being strictly forbidden in the standard model, experimental detection of the\nlepton flavor violating decays $B(\\bar B)\\to\\tau^+\\mu^-$ and $b(\\bar b)\\to\nX\\tau^+\\mu^-$ would constitute an unmistakable indication of new physics. We\nstudy these decays in supersymmetric models without R-parity and without lepton\nnumber. In order to derive order of magnitude predictions for the branching\nratios, we assume a horizontal U(1) symmetry with horizontal charges chosen to\nexplain the magnitude of fermion masses and quark mixing angles. We find that\nthe branching ratios for decays with a $\\tau\\mu$ pair in the final state are\nnot particularly suppressed with respect to the lepton flavor conserving\nchannels. In general in these models ${\\rm B}[b\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-(X)]\\lsim {\\rm\nB}[b(\\bar b)\\to\\tau^+\\mu^-(X)] \\lsim {\\rm B}[b\\to\\tau^+\\tau^-(X)]$. While in\nsome cases the rates for final states $\\tau^+\\tau^-$ can be up to one order of\nmagnitude larger than the lepton flavor violating channel, due to better\nefficiencies for muon detection and to the absence of standard model\ncontributions, decays into $\\tau\\mu$ final states appear to be better suited to\nreveal this kind of new physics.\n", "  We examine the sensitivity of flavor changing neutral current (FCNC)\nprocesses to anomalous triple gauge boson couplings. We show that in the\nnon-linear realization of the electroweak symmetry breaking sector these\nprocesses are very sensitive to two CP conserving anomalous couplings. A clean\nseparation of their effects is possible in the next round of experiments\nprobing $b\\to s\\gamma$ and $b\\to s\\ell^+\\ell^-$ processes, as well as kaon\ndecays such as $K^+\\to\\pi^+\\nu\\bar\\nu$. The obtained sensitivity is found to be\ncompetitive with that of direct measurements at high energy colliders. In\nparticular, for one of the $WWZ$ couplings the one-loop FCNC effects are\nenhanced by a logarithmic dependence on the scale of new physics. We also\nexplore the potential signals of CP violating anomalous triple gauge boson\ncouplings in rare $B$ decays.\n", "  We examine the influence of gauge kinetic mixing on the couplings of a TeV\nscale $Z'$ in both $E_6$ and SO(10) models. The strength of such mixing, which\narises due to the existence of incomplete matter representations at low scale,\ncan be described by a single parameter, $\\delta$. The value of this parameter\ncan significantly influence the ability of both hadron and lepton colliders to\ndetect a $Z'$ using conventional search techniques. In addition, $\\delta \\neq\n0$ also adds to the complexities involved in separating $E_6$ $Z'$ models from\nthose arising from alternative scenarios. Employing a reasonable set of\nassumptions we have determined the allowed range for this parameter within a\nwide class of models via an RGE analysis. In particular, given the requirements\nof Standard Model gauge coupling unification, anomaly freedom and\nperturbativity up to the GUT scale, we demonstrate that the necessary condition\nfor exact leptophobia in $\\eta$ type $E_6$ models, $\\delta=-1/3$, is impossible\nto achieve in this scenario. Furthermore we show that the allowed range for\n$\\delta$ is rather restricted for arbitrary values of the mixing between the\n$U(1)_\\chi$ and $U(1)_\\psi$ type couplings. The SO(10) $Z'$ model $\\chi$ is\ndiscussed as a separate case since it requires special attention.\n", "  In this work we study the thermodynamic properties of the pion gas starting\nfrom the realistic elastic scattering phase-shifts obtained from Chiral\nPerturbation Theory and using the virial expansion. In particular we study the\nstate equation and the behavior of the quark condensate as a function of the\ntemperature and the density.\n", "  In 2+1 dimensional gauge thories with $SU(N_c)$ color and $2N_f$ flavors of\nquarks in the fundamental representation, sphalerons, if present may lead to\nquark condensation and chiral symmetry breaking. The effect is similar to\ninstanton induced chiral symmetry breaking in 3+1 dimensions and is due to the\ninteraction of quark propagators with sphalerons. The existence of sphalerons\nrequires that color symmetries be broken by a Higgs in the fundamental\nrepresentation. We show that the sphaleron effect may persist for arbitrarily\nlarge $N_f$ but vanishes along with the mass of the gauge fields corresponding\nto broken generators of $SU(N_c)$. The effect is inherently non-Abelian and\nabsent for QED.\n", "  Penguin contributions, being not negligible in general, can hide the\ninformation on the CKM angle alpha coming from the measurement of the\ntime-dependent B0(t) -> pi+pi- CP-asymmetry. Nevertheless, we show that this\ninformation can be summarized in a set of simple equations, expressing alpha as\na multi-valued function of a single theoretically unknown parameter, which\nconveniently can be chosen as a well-defined ratio of penguin to tree\namplitudes. Using these exact analytic expressions, free of any assumption\nbesides the Standard Model, and some reasonable hypotheses to constrain the\nmodulus of the penguin amplitude, we derive several new upper bounds on the\npenguin-induced shift |2alpha-2alpha_eff|, generalizing the recent result of\nGrossman and Quinn. These bounds depend on the averaged branching ratios of\nsome decays (pi0pi0, K0K0bar, K+-pi-+) particularly sensitive to the penguin.\nOn the other hand, with further and less conservative approximations, we show\nthat the knowledge of the B+- -> Kpi+- branching ratio alone gives sufficient\ninformation to extract the free parameter without the need of other\nmeasurements, and without knowing |V_td| or |V_ub|. More generally, knowing the\nmodulus of the penguin amplitude with an accuracy of ~30% might result in an\nextraction of alpha competitive with the experimentally more difficult isospin\nanalysis. We also show that our framework allows to recover most of the\nprevious approaches in a transparent and simple way, and in some cases to\nimprove them. In addition we discuss in detail the problem of the various kinds\nof discrete ambiguities.\n", "  We calculate single top-quark production at hadron colliders via the\nchromo-magnetic flavor-changing neutral current couplings $\\bar tcg$ and $\\bar\ntug$. We find that the strength for the anomalous $\\bar tcg$ ($\\bar tug$)\ncoupling may be probed to $\\kappa_c / \\Lambda = 0.092 {TeV}^{-1}$ ($\\kappa_u /\n\\Lambda = 0.026 {TeV}^{-1}$) at the Tevatron with $2 {fb}^{-1}$ of data and\n$\\kappa_c / \\Lambda = 0.013 {TeV}^{-1}$ ($\\kappa_u / \\Lambda = 0.0061\n{TeV}^{-1}$) at the LHC with $10 {fb}^{-1}$ of data. The two couplings may be\ndistinguished by a comparision of the single top signal with the direct top and\ntop decay signals for these couplings.\n", "  We discuss the potentialities of the non-standard interaction study via the\nHiggs boson production at photon ($\\ggam$ and $e\\gamma$) colliders. We estimate\nthe scale of New Physics phenomena beyond the standard model that can be seen\nin the experiments with Higgs boson production. In particular, the effect of\nnew heavy particles within the standard model is shown to be quite observable.\n", "  The two-loop three-gluon vertex is calculated in an arbitrary covariant\ngauge, in the limit when two of the gluons are on the mass shell. The\ncorresponding two-loop results for the ghost-gluon vertex are also obtained. It\nis shown that the results are consistent with the Ward-Slavnov-Taylor\nidentities.\n", "  The most general model-independent analysis of the rare $B$ decay, $\\Bsll$,\nis presented. There are ten independent local four-Fermi interactions which may\ncontribute to this process. The branching ratio, the forward-backward\nasymmetry, and the double differential rate are written as functions of the\nWilson coefficients of the ten operators. We also study the correlation between\nthe branching ratio and the forward-backward asymmetry by changing each\ncoefficient. This procedure tells us which types of operator contribute to the\nprocess, and it will be very useful to pin down new physics systematically,\nonce we have the experimental data with high statistics and the deviation from\nthe Standard Model is found.\n", "  The Dualized Standard Model which gives explanations for both fermion\ngenerations and Higgs fields has already been used to calculate fermion mass\nand mixing parameters with success. In this paper, we extend its application to\nlow energy FCNC effects deriving bounds for various processes in terms of one\nsingle mass scale. Using then experimental information from K_L - K_S mass\ndifference and air showers beyond the GZK cut-off, these bounds are converted\ninto rough, order-of-magnitude predictions. In particular, the estimates for\nthe decay K_L \\to e^\\pm \\mu^\\mp and for the mass difference between the neutral\nD-mesons seem accessible to experiment in the near future.\n", "  An alternative pattern of the chiral symmetry breaking, suggested recently by\nStern, is investigated. It could be self-consistent provided that the chiral\n$SU(N_f) \\times SU(N_f)$ symmetry is broken spontaneously down to $SU(N_f)\n\\times Z_{N_f}$ rather than to $SU(N_f)_V$. The discrete axial $Z_{N_f}$ then\nwould play a custodial role preventing the quark bilinears from condensation.\nIt is shown that this pattern of the chiral symmetry breaking is ruled out in\nQCD by exact inequalities. It is not ruled out, however, in other gauge\ntheories with scalar quarks and/or Yukawa couplings.\n", "  We discuss dimension-5 operators in supersymmetric models containing extra\nhypercharge 1/3 color-triplets. We derive a general formula relating\ndimension-5 operator to the color-triplet mass matrix. We show that certain\nzeros in the triplet mass-matrix together with some triplet coupling selection\nrules can lead to elimination of dimension-5 operators. In particular we focus\non SU(5) models and show that (a) Dimension-5 operators can be eliminated in\nthe standard SU(5) model by the introduction of an extra pair of 5+5b Higgses\nwith specific couplings (b) Flipped SU(5) models with extra 10+10b Higgses are\nfree of dimension-5 operators (c) Flipped SU(5) models with extra 5+5b and/or\nextra 10+10b Higgses can be made free of dimension-5 operators for a textured\nform of the triplet mass-matrix accompanied by constraints on the 5-plet\ncouplings to matter. Our analysis is motivated by the recently put forward\nM-theory phenomenological framework that requires a strong string coupling and\nreintroduces the problem of eliminating dimension-5 operators.\n", "  We examine the possibility of recovering the supersymmetric (and soft\nsupersymmetry breaking) Lagrangian parameters as direct {\\em analytical}\nexpressions of appropriate physical masses, for the unconstrained (but CP and\nR-parity conserving) minimal supersymmetric standard model. We concentrate\nmainly on the algebraically non-trivial \"inversion\" for the ino parameters, and\nobtain, for given values of $\\tan\\beta$, simple analytical expressions for the\n$\\mu$, $M_1$ and $M_2$ parameters in terms of three arbitrary input physical\nmasses, namely either two chargino and one neutralino masses, or alternatively\none chargino and two neutralino masses. We illustrate and discuss in detail the\npossible occurrence of ambiguities in this reconstruction. The dependence of\nthe resulting ino Lagrangian parameters upon physical masses is illustrated,\nand some simple generic behaviour uncovered in this way. We finally briefly\nsketch generalizing such an inversion to the full set of MSSM Lagrangian\nparameters.\n", "  We explore a new class of axion models in which some, but not all, of the\nleft-handed quarks have a Peccei-Quinn symmetry. These models are potentially\nafflicted by flavour changing neutral currents. We derive the bounds on the\nPeccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking scale from bounds on the $K^+\\to \\pi^+ a$\nbranching ratio, showing that in some cases they are even stronger than the\nastrophysical ones, but still not strong enough to kill off the models.\n", "  The effect of a random magnetic field in the convective zone of the Sun on\nresonant neutrino spin oscillations, i.e. transitions of the type\n$\\nu_{eL}\\to\\tilde\\nu_{\\mu R}$, is considered. The average survival probability\nand the expected experimental signals in the existing solar neutrino\nexperiments are computed as a function of the level of the noise and magnitude\nof a constant magnetic field in the convective zone. From comparison with\nobserved detection rates we conclude that the RSFP solutions to the SNP with\nnegligible mixing angle are stable under the presence of low or moderate levels\nof noise. Detection rates, specially in the Homestake experiment, are however\nsensitive to large levels of noise. As a consequence, an upper limit on small\nscale magnetic fluctuations is obtained from the combined solar data:\n$\\surd\\langle B^2\\rangle< 140-200 $ kG for the scale $L_0\\sim 1000 $ km and\ntransition moment $\\mu=10^{-11} \\mu_B$.\n", "  We study the properties and couplings of hybrid baryons in the large-$N_c$\nexpansion. These are color-neutral baryon states which contain in addition to\n$N_c$ quarks also one constituent gluon. Hybrid baryons with both symmetric and\nmixed symmetric orbital wave functions are considered. We introduce a Hartree\ndescription for these states, similar to the one used by Witten for ordinary\nbaryons. It is shown that the Hartree equations for $N_c (N_c-1)$ quarks for\nsymmetric (mixed symmetric) states in these states coincide with those in\nordinary baryons in the large-$N_c$ limit. The energy due to the gluon field is\nof order $\\Lambda_{QCD}$. Under the assumption of color confinement, our\nresults prove the existence of hybrid baryons made up of heavy quarks in the\nlarge $N_c$ limit and provides a justification for the constituent gluon\npicture of these states. The couplings of the hybrid baryons to mesons of\narbitrary spin are computed in the quark model. Using constraints from the\nlarge $N_c$ scaling laws for the meson-baryon scattering amplitudes, we write\ndown consistency conditions for the meson couplings of the hybrid baryons.\nThese consistency conditions are solved explicitly with results in agreement\nwith those in the quark model for the respective couplings.\n", "  Hadron spectra and hadronic moments in the decay $B \\to X_s \\ell^+ \\ell^-$\nare calculated taking into account both the short-distance and long-distance\ncontributions in the decay amplitude using a Fermi motion (FM) model to\nincorporate the $B$-meson wave-function effects. The measured branching ratios\nfor the inclusive decays $B \\to X_s+ (J/\\psi,\\psi^\\prime,...)\\to X_s \\ell^+\n\\ell^-$ are used to fix the normalization of the long-distance contribution.\nThe momentum distribution of the $J/\\psi$ measured by the CLEO collaboration is\nfitted in the FM model which is then used to calculate the hadronic spectra\nfrom the resonant contribution also away from the $J/\\psi$-resonance. We also\nstudy the effect of various descriptions of the resonant and non-resonant\n$c\\bar{c}$ contributions in $B \\to X_s \\ell^+ \\ell^-$ existing in the\nliterature on the hadron energy and invariant mass spectra, and in the\nForward-Backward asymmetry. Selective cuts on the hadron and dilepton invariant\nmasses can be used to reduce the $B\\bar{B}$ background and resonant\ncontribution and, as an example, we work out the hadron spectra with the\nexperimental cuts used by the CLEO collaboration in searching for the decay $B\n\\to X_s \\ell^+ \\ell^-$. We show that data from the forthcoming B facilities\ncould be used effectively to measure the short-distance contribution in $B \\to\nX_s \\ell^+ \\ell^-$, enabling precise determination of the FM model and heavy\nquark effective theory parameters $\\lambda_1$ and $\\bar{\\Lambda}$.\n", "  We revisit our recently proposed formalism for dealing with the heavy quark\nlimit of the quark Dyson-Schwinger equation. An ambiguity inherent in the\noriginal version of method is identified and resolved. Our reanalysis\nillustrates the importance of correctly accounting for the effect of hard gluon\nmomenta on the heavy quark self energy in the vicinity of the bare fermion mass\npole.\n", "  We present a model of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking in which the\nsplitting between the top and bottom quark masses arises naturally. The W and Z\nmasses are produced by a minimal technicolor sector, the top quark mass is\ngiven by the exchange of a weak-doublet technicolored scalar, and the other\nquark and lepton masses are induced by the exchange of a weak-doublet\ntechnicolor-singlet scalar. We show that, in the presence of the latter scalar,\nthe vacuum alignment is correct even in the case of SU(2) technicolor. The fit\nof this model to the electroweak data gives an acceptable agreement\n(chi-squared = 28 for 20 degrees of freedom). The mass hierarchy between the\nstandard fermions other than top can also be explained in terms of the\nhierarchy of squared-masses of some additional scalars. We discuss various\npossibilities for the compositeness of the scalars introduced here.\n", "  We analyze the renormalon ambiguities that appear in factorization formulas\nin QCD. Our analysis contains a simple argument that the ambiguities in the\nshort-distance coefficients and operator matrix elements are artifacts of\ndimensional-regularization factorization schemes and are absent in cutoff\nschemes. We also present a method for computing the renormalon ambiguities in\noperator matrix elements and apply it to a computation of the ambiguities in\nthe matrix elements that appear in the NRQCD factorization formulas for the\nannihilation decays of S-wave quarkonia. Our results, combined with those of\nBraaten and Chen for the short-distance coefficients, provide an explicit\ndemonstration that the ambiguities cancel in the physical decay rates. In\naddition, we analyze the renormalon ambiguities in the Gremm-Kapustin relation\nand in various definitions of the heavy-quark mass.\n", "  We examine the effects of the lepton number violating R parity odd\ninteractions, $\\lambda_{ijk} $, on single production of fermion (charginos and\nneutralinos) and scalar (sleptons and sneutrinos) superpartners at leptonic\ncolliders for center of mass energies up to $500GeV - 1TeV$. The probability\namplitudes for all the five relevant $2 \\to 2$ body processes and the decays\nbranching ratios for the produced superpartners are calculated at tree level. A\nsemi-quantitative discussion is developed within a supergravity model assuming\ngrand unification of gauge interactions and universal (flavor independent) soft\nsupersymmetry breaking parameters at the unification scale. The predictions\nobtained for the total and partial rates show that the single production\nreactions have a good potential of observability at NLC (Next Linear Colliders)\nenergies. For values of the R parity violating coupling constant, $\\lambda\n_{ijk}= 0.05$, close to the current bounds, the $\\tilde \\chi^{\\pm, 0}$\nreactions could probe all the relevant intervals for $\\tan \\beta$ and $m_0$ and\nbroad regions of the parameter space for $\\mu$ and $M_2$, while the $\\tilde \\nu\n$ and $\\tilde l $ productions could probe sneutrinos and sleptons masses up to\nthe kinematical limits. Using the hypothesis of a single dominant R parity\nviolating coupling constant, a Monte Carlo events simulation for the $ \\tilde\n\\chi^{\\pm, 0} $ reactions is employed to deduce some characteristic final\nstates dynamical distributions.\n", "  We investigate a modification of the $k_\\perp$-clustering jet algorithm for\nhadron-hadron collisions, analogous to the ``Cambridge'' algorithm recently\nproposed for $e^+e^-$ annihilation, in which pairs of objects that are close in\nangle are combined preferentially. This has the effect of building jets from\nthe inside out, with the aim of reducing the amount of the underlying event\nincorporated into them. We also investigate a second modification that involves\nusing a new separation measure. Monte Carlo studies suggest that the standard\n$k_\\perp$ algorithm performs as well as either of these modified algorithms\nwith respect to hadronization corrections and reconstruction of the mass of a\nHiggs boson decaying to $b\\bar b$.\n", "  We consider a heavy fourth family with masses lying in the symmetry breaking\nchannel of a new strong gauge interaction. This interaction generates a heavy\nquark axial-type operator, whose effects can be enhanced through multiple\ninsertions. In terms of the strength of this operator we can express new\nnegative contributions to the S and T parameters and the shifts of the Z\ncouplings to the third family. In particular we find that the new contribution\nto T is strongly constrained by the experimental constraints on the Z coupling\nto the tau.\n", "  We analyze the instanton transitions in the framework of the gauge invariant\nvariational calculation in the pure Yang-Mills theory. Instantons are\nidentified with the saddle points in the integration over the gauge group which\nprojects the Gaussian wave functional onto the gauge invariant physical Hilbert\nspace. We show that the dynamical mass present in the best variational state\nprovides an infrared cutoff for the instanton sizes. The instantons of the size\n$\\rho<1/M$ are suppressed and the large size instanton problem arising in the\nstandard WKB calculation is completely avoided in the present variational\nframework.\n", "  We study the $p\\bar p$ production and decay of exotic quarks that are\npredicted by the SU(3)$\\times$U(1) extension of the Standard Model. We show\nthat recent experimental searches for SUSY particles at the Tevatron limit the\nmass of these quarks to be above 250 GeV. Run II will extend the reach to 320\nGeV. This is one example of SUSY search signatures that apply directly to\nanother, quite different, new physics model.\n", "  We compute the decay rates and $H$-energy distributions of $B$ mesons into\nthe final state $H+X$, where $H$ can be any one of the $S$-wave or $P$-wave\ncharmonia, at next-to-leading order in the strong coupling. We find that a\nsignificant fraction of the observed $J/\\psi$, $\\psi'$ and $\\chi_c$ must be\nproduced through $c\\bar{c}$ pairs in a colour octet state and should therefore\nbe accompanied by more than one light hadron. At the same time we obtain\nstringent constraints on some of the long-distance parameters for colour octet\nproduction.\n", "  Several possible statistical interpretations of the null result of the KARMEN\n2 neutrino oscillation experiment are discussed with the aim of clarifying the\nimplications of the fact that KARMEN 2 did not observe any of the expected\nbackground events. The formalism that allows to take into account the error of\nthe expected mean background in a Poisson process with background is presented\nand applied to the statistical analysis of the KARMEN 2 null result. The\npossibility of ignoring the expected mean background calculated for the KARMEN\n2 experiment is discussed and it is shown that the resulting exclusion curves\nare ultra-conservative, but may be a safe choice in such a controversial case.\nIt is also shown that the sensitivity curves of neutrino oscillation\nexperiments cannot be considered as exclusion curves. The implications of the\ndifferent statistical analyses of the KARMEN 2 null result for the\ncompatibility of the results of the KARMEN 2 and LSND experiments is discussed.\n", "  We study CP violating B decays in the minimal supersymmetric standard model\nwith R-parity violation. We estimate how much R-parity violation modifies the\nSM predictions for CP asymmetries in B decays within the present bounds. The\neffects of R-parity- and lepton-number-violating couplings on the ratio of the\ndecay amplitude due to R-parity violation to that of the SM can differ by one\nor two orders of magnitudes depending on the models of the left-handed quark\nmixing. It is possible to disentangle the R-parity violating effects from those\nof the SM and R-parity- conserving supersymmetric models within the present\nbounds comparing different CP violating decay amplitudes. We also study the\neffects of R-parity- and baryon-number-violating couplings and find that the\neffects could be large.\n", "  Supersymmetric models with nonuniversal down type squark masses can enrich\nthe chiral structure and CP violating phenomena in $b\\to s\\gamma$ decays.\nDirect CP violation in $b\\to s \\gamma$, mixing induced CP violation in\nradiative $B_{d,s}$ decays (such as $B_s\\to \\phi \\gamma$ and $B_d \\to\nK^*_{1,2}\\gamma$), and $\\Lambda$ polarization in $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda \\gamma$\ncan be substantially different from the Standard Model. Future experiements at\n$e^+ e^-$ and hadronic B factories will give important information on the\nunderlying theory for radiative $b$ decays.\n", "  We study the possible signature for lepton-flavor violation processes in the\nscalar-lepton sector of the minimal supersymmetric model at future\nelectron-photon colliders. We find that an $\\egm$ collider can provide a good\nopportunity to probe the mass differences and flavor mixing angles between the\nsleptons of the first generation and the other two generations for the\nright-handed as well as the left-handed sector. The sensitivity reach for\nlepton-flavor violation is comparable to that obtained at an $e^+e^-$ and\n$e^-e^-$ collider, and is significantly better than the current bound from\nlow-energy rare processes such as $\\mu \\to e \\gamma$.\n", "  We discuss the phenomenology of initial-state parton-kt broadening in\ndirect-photon production and related processes in hadron collisions. After a\nbrief summary of the theoretical basis for a Gaussian-smearing approach, we\npresent a systematic study of recent results on fixed-target and collider\ndirect-photon production, using complementary data on diphoton and pion\nproduction to provide empirical guidance on the required amount of kt\nbroadening. This approach provides a consistent description of the observed\npattern of deviation of next-to-leading order QCD calculations relative to the\ndirect-photon data, and accounts for the shape and normalization difference\nbetween fixed-order perturbative calculations and the data. We also discuss the\nuncertainties in this phenomenological approach, the implications of these\nresults on the extraction of the gluon distribution of the nucleon, and the\ncomparison of our findings to recent related work.\n", "  We suggest an anomalous effective Lagrangian which reproduces the anomalous\nconformal and chiral Ward identities and topological charge quantization in\nQCD. It is shown that the large N_c Di Vecchia-Veneziano-Witten effective\nchiral Lagrangian is locally recovered from our results, along with 1/N_c\ncorrections, after integrating out the heavy \"glueball\" fields. All\ndimensionful parameters in our scheme are fixed in terms of the quark and gluon\ncondensates and quark masses. We argue that for a certain range of parameters,\nmetastable vacua appear which are separated from the true vacuum of lowest\nenergy by domain walls. The surface tension of the wall is estimated, and the\ndynamics of the wall is discussed. The U(1) problem and the physics of the\npseudo-goldstone bosons at different theta angles are addressed within the\neffective Lagrangian approach. Implications for axion physics, heavy ion\ncollisions and the development of the early Universe during the QCD epoch are\ndiscussed.\n", "  We parametrize in a model-independent way possible departures from the\nminimal Standard Model predictions in the matter sector. We only assume the\nsymmetry breaking pattern of the Standard Model and that new particles are\nsufficiently heavy so that the symmetry is non-linearly realized. Models with\ndynamical symmetry breaking are generically of this type. We review in the\neffective theory language to what extent the simplest models of dynamical\nbreaking are actually constrained and the assumptions going into the comparison\nwith experiment. Dynamical symmetry breaking models can be approximated at\nintermediate energies by four-fermion operators. We present a complete\nclassification of the latter when new particles appear in the usual\nrepresentations of the $SU(2)_L\\times SU(3)_c$ group as well as a partial\nclassification in the general case. We discuss the accuracy of the four-fermion\ndescription by matching to a simple `fundamental' theory. The coefficients of\nthe effective lagrangian in the matter sector for dynamical symmetry breaking\nmodels (expressed in terms of the coefficients of the four-quark operators) are\nthen compared to those of models with elementary scalars (such as the minimal\nStandard Model). Contrary to a somewhat widespread belief, we see that the sign\nof the vertex corrections is not fixed in dynamical symmetry breaking models.\nThis work provides the theoretical tools required to analyze, in a rather\ngeneral setting, constraints on the matter sector of the Standard Model.\n", "  The hard exclusive electroproduction of $\\pi^0,\\eta,\\eta'$ mesons by the\nlongitudinal photons is considered. We calculate the ratios of the $\\pi^0 :\n\\eta : \\eta'$ yields for the electroproduction processes off nucleons and\ndeuterons based on the QCD factorization theorem, the low energy QCD chiral\ndynamics, and the QCD anomaly. Thus investigation of these ratios gives a new\nway to probe the physics of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking.\n", "  Two-body charmless nonleptonic decays of the B_s meson are studied within the\nframework of generalized factorization in which factorization is applied to the\ntree level matrix elements while the effective Wilson coefficients are $\\mu$\nand renormalization scheme independent, and nonfactorizable effects are\nparametrized in terms of N_c(LL) and N_c(LR), the effective numbers of colors\narising from (V-A)(V-A) and (V-A)(V+A) four-quark operators, respectively.\nBranching ratios of $B_s\\to PP,PV,VV$ decays are calculated as a function of\nN_c(LR) with two different considerations for N_c(LL). We find that (i) the\nelectroweak penguin contributions account for about 85% (for N_c(LL)=2) of the\ndecay rates of $B_s\\to \\eta\\pi,\\eta'\\pi,\\eta\\rho,\\eta'\\rho,\\phi\\pi,\\phi\\rho$,\nwhich receive contributions only from tree and electroweak penguin diagrams; a\nmeasurement of them will provide a clean determination of the electroweak\npenguin coefficient a_9, (ii) electroweak penguin corrections to $B_s\\to\\omega\n\\etapp,\\phi\\eta,\\omega\\phi,K^{(*)}\\phi,\\phi\\phi$ are in general as significant\nas QCD penguin effects and even play a dominant role; their decay rates depend\nstrongly on N_c(LR), (iii) the branching ratio of $B_s\\to \\eta\\eta'$ is of\norder 2x10^{-5}, (iv) the contribution from the $\\eta'$ charm content is\nimportant for $B_s\\to\\eta'\\eta'$, but less significant for $B_s\\to\\eta\\eta'$,\nand (v) the decay rates for the final states $K^{+(*)}K^{-(*)}$ follow the\npattern: $\\Gamma(B_s\\to K^+K^-)>\\Gamma(B_s\\to K^+K^{*-})\\geq\\Gamma(B_s\\to\nK^{*+}K^{*-}) >\\Gamma(B_s\\to K^{+*}K^-)$, as a consequence of various\ninterference effects between the penguin amplitudes governed by the\ncoefficients a_4 and a_6.\n", "  What is commonly called the reheat temperature, $T_{RH}$, is not the maximum\ntemperature obtained after inflation. The maximum temperature is, in fact, much\nlarger than $T_{RH}$. As an application of this we consider the production of\nmassive stable dark-matter particles of mass $M_X$ during reheating, and show\nthat their abundance is suppressed as a power of $T_{RH}/M_X$ rather than\n$\\exp(-M_X/T_{RH})$. We find that particles of mass as large as $2\\times 10^3$\ntimes the reheat temperature may be produced in interesting abundance. In\naddition to dark matter, our analysis is relevant for baryogenesis if the\nbaryon asymmetry is produced by the baryon (or lepton) number violating decays\nof superheavy bosons, and also for relic ultra-high energy cosmic rays if\ndecays of superheavy particles are responsible for the highest energy cosmic\nrays.\n", "  We revisit the work of K. Goeke, M. Harvey, F. Gr\\\"ummer, and J. N. Urbano\n(Phys. Rev. {\\bf D37}, 754 (1988)) who considered a chiral model for the\nnucleon based on the linear sigma model with scalar-isoscalar scalar-isovector\nmesons coupled to quarks and solved using the coherent-pair approximation. In\nthis way the quantum pion field can be treated in a non-perturbative fashion.\nIn this work we review this model and the coherent pair approximation\ncorrecting several errors in the earlier work. We minimize the expectation\nvalue of the chiral hamiltonian in the ansatz coherent-pair ground state\nconfiguration and solve the resulting equations for nucleon quantum numbers. We\ncalculate the canonical set of nucleon observables and compare with the\nHedgehog model and experiment. Using the corrected equations yield slightly\ndifferent values for nucleon observables but do not correct the large virial\ndeviation in the $\\pi$-nucleon coupling. Our results therefore do not\nsignificantly alter the conclusions of Goeke, et al..\n", "  In an R-parity-violating supersymmetric theory, we derive upper bounds on all\nthe \\lambda''_{ijk}\\lambda_{i'j'k'}-type combinations from the consideration of\nproton stability, where \\lambda''_{ijk} are baryon-number-violating couplings\ninvolving three baryonic fields and \\lambda_{i'j'k'} are\nlepton-number-violating couplings involving three leptonic fields.\n", "  We apply analytic perturbation theory to the Gross--Llewellyn Smith sum rule.\nWe study the $Q^2$ evolution and the renormalization scheme dependence of the\nanalytic three-loop QCD correction to this sum rule, and demonstrate that the\nresults are practically renormalization scheme independent and lead to rather\ndifferent $Q^2$ evolution than the standard perturbative correction possesses.\n", "  We compute the virtual next-to-leading corrections to the Lipatov vertex in\nthe helicity-amplitude formalism. These agree with previous results by Fadin\nand collaborators, in the conventional dimensional-regularization scheme. We\ndiscuss the choice of reggeization scale in order to minimize its impact on the\nnext-to-leading-logarithmic corrections to the BFKL equation.\n", "  A systematic study is performed on the finite harmonic sums up to level four.\nThese sums form the general basis for the Mellin transforms of all individual\nfunctions $f_i(x)$ of the momentum fraction $x$ emerging in the quantities of\nmassless QED and QCD up to two--loop order, as the unpolarized and polarized\nsplitting functions, coefficient functions, and hard scattering cross sections\nfor space and time-like momentum transfer. The finite harmonic sums are\ncalculated explicitly in the linear representation. Algebraic relations\nconnecting these sums are derived to obtain representations based on a reduced\nset of basic functions. The Mellin transforms of all the corresponding Nielsen\nfunctions are calculated.\n", "  We calculate the rates for lepton number violating processes via the exchange\nof the Z' boson occuring in top-color assisted technicolor. The current\nexperimental limits on muon electron conversion in Ti nuclei allow for a mass\nof the new gauge boson around 1 TeV and the magnitudes of the mixing angles\nturn out to lie roughly between the analogous elements of the CKM matrix and\nits square root.\n", "  In the most general R-parity violating model, including both bilinear and\ntrilinear terms, the sneutrino receives a vacuum expectation value. We\ninvestigate the constraints on this vev following a basis independent approach,\nhighlighting the relations between the three most popular basis. We study the\nprediction for the tau neutrino mass which follows from the minimization of the\nscalar potential in a SUGRA model with universality of the soft parameters at\nthe GUT scale. Finally we show that the tau neutrino mass controls the R-parity\nviolating effects both in the fermionic and scalar sectors.\n", "  The time-dependent angular distributions of decays of neutral $B$ mesons into\ntwo vector mesons contain information about the lifetimes, mass differences,\nstrong and weak phases, form factors, and CP violating quantities. A\nstatistical analysis of the information content is performed by giving the\n``information'' a quantitative meaning. It is shown that for some parameters of\ninterest, the information content in time and angular measurements combined may\nbe orders of magnitude more than the information from time measurements alone\nand hence the angular measurements are highly recommended. The method of\nangular moments is compared with the (maximum) likelihood method to find that\nit works almost as well in the region of interest for the one-angle\ndistribution. For the complete three-angle distribution, an estimate of\npossible statistical errors expected on the observables of interest is\nobtained. It indicates that the three-angle distribution, unraveled by the\nmethod of angular moments, would be able to nail down many quantities of\ninterest and will help in pointing unambiguously to new physics.\n", "  In this article we study the dynamics of fermions in a fermion-scalar plasma.\nWe begin by obtaining the effective in-medium Dirac equation in real time which\nis fully renormalized and causal and leads to the initial value problem. For a\nheavy scalar we find the novel result that the decay of the scalar into fermion\npairs in the medium leads to damping of the fermionic excitations and their\nin-medium propagation as quasiparticles. That is, the fermions acquire a width\ndue to the decay of the heavier scalar in the medium. We find the damping rate\nto lowest order in the Yukawa coupling for arbitrary values of scalar and\nfermion masses, temperature and fermion momentum. An all-order expression for\nthe damping rate in terms of the exact quasiparticle wave functions is\nestablished. A kinetic Boltzmann approach to the relaxation of the fermionic\ndistribution function confirms the damping of fermionic excitations as a\nconsequence of the induced decay of heavy scalars in the medium. A\nlinearization of the Boltzmann equation near equilibrium clearly displays the\nrelationship between the damping rate of fermionic mean fields and the fermion\ninteraction rate to lowest order in the Yukawa coupling directly in real time.\n", "  Heckler has recently argued that the Hawking radiation emitted from\nmicroscopic black holes has sufficiently strong interactions above a certain\ncritical temperature that it forms a photosphere, analogous to that of the sun.\nIn this case, the visible radiation is much cooler than the central temperature\nat the Schwarzschild radius, in contrast to the naive expectation for the\nobservable spectrum. We investigate these ideas more quantitatively by solving\nthe Boltzmann equation using the test particle method. We confirm that at least\ntwo kinds of photospheres may form: a quark-gluon plasma for black holes of\nmass M_{BH} < 5 times 10^{14} g and an electron-positron-photon plasma for\nM_{BH} < 2 times 10^{12} g. The QCD photosphere extends from the black hole\nhorizon to a distance of 0.2--4.0 fm for 10^9 g < M_{BH} < 5 10^{14} g, at\nwhich point quarks and gluons with average energy of order \\Lambda_{QCD}\nhadronize. The QED photosphere starts at a distance of approximately 700 black\nhole radii and dissipates at about 400 fm, where the average energy of the\nemitted electrons, positrons and photons is inversely proportional to the black\nhole temperature, and significantly higher than was found by Heckler. The\nconsequences of these photospheres for the cosmic diffuse gamma ray and\nantiproton backgrounds are discussed: bounds on the black hole contribution to\nthe density of the universe are slightly weakened.\n", "  The isospin-breaking vector meson decay constants are determined from a QCD\nsum rule analysis of the vector current correlator $<O| T(V^3_\\mu V^8_\\nu)|\nO>$, using a recently proposed implementation of the finite energy sum rule\napproach. The analysis employs the three-loop version of the OPE, and two\ndifferent families of weight functions. It is shown that the requirement of\nconsistency between results obtained using these two different weight families\nleads to a rather good determination of the parameter describing the deviation\nof the D=6 condensate term in the OPE from its vacuum saturation value, and\nthat the ability to determine this value has non-trivial numerical consequences\nto the analysis. The phenomenological relevance of the results to the\nextraction of the strange quark mass and the determination of the $6^{th}$\norder chiral low energy constant, $Q$, is also briefly discussed.\n", "  The interaction energy of the neutrons due to massless neutrino exchange in a\nneutron star has recently been proved, using an effective theory, to be\nextremely small and infrared-safe. Our comment here is of conceptual order: two\napproaches to compute the total interaction energy density have recently been\nproposed. Here, we study the connection between these two approaches. From CP\ninvariance, we argue that the resulting interaction energy has to be even in\nthe parameter $b=-G_F n_n /\\sqrt{2}$, which expresses the static neutrino\npotential created by a neutron medium of density $n_n$.\n", "  We analyze a quantum kinetic equation describing both boson and fermion pair\nproduction and explore analytically and numerically the solution of the\nnon-Markovian kinetic equation. In the Markovian limit of the kinetic equation\nwe find an analytical solution for the single particle distribution function of\nbosons and fermions. The numerical investigation for a homogeneous, constant\nelectric field shows an enhancement (bosons) or a suppression (fermions) of the\npair creation rate according to the symmetry character of the produced\nparticles. For strong fields non-Markovian effects are important while they\ndisappear for weak fields. Hence it is sufficient to apply the low density\nlimit for weak fields but necessary to take into account memory effects for\nstrong fields.\n", "  We report the first fully general numerical calculation of the neutron and\nelectron dipole moments, including the seven significant phases. We find that\nthere are major regions in the parameter space where none of the phases are\nrequired to be small, contrary to the conventional wisdom. The electric dipole\nmoments (EDM's) do provide useful constraints, allowing other regions of\nparameter space to be carved away. We keep all superpartner masses light so\nagreement with experimental limits arises purely from interesting relations\namong soft breaking parameters.\n", "  Taking the solar and the atmospheric neutrino experiments into account we\ndiscuss the lepton flavor violating processes, such as $\\tau\\to\\mu\\gamma$ or\n$\\mu\\to e\\gamma$, in the minimal supersymmetric standard model with\nright-handed neutrinos (MSSMRN) and the supersymmetric SU(5) GUT with\nright-handed neutrinos (SU(5)RN). The predicted branching ratio of $\\mu\\to\ne\\gamma$ in the MSSMRN with the MSW large angle solution is so large that it\ngoes beyond the current experimental bound if the second-generation\nright-handed Majorana mass $M_{\\nu_2}$ is greater than $\\sim 10^{13}(\\sim\n10^{14})$GeV for $\\tan\\beta=30(3)$. When we take the MSW small angle solution,\nthe $\\mu\\to e\\gamma$ rate is at most about 1/100 of that of the MSW large angle\nsolution. The 'just so' solution implies $10^{-5}$ of that of the MSW large\nangle solution. Also, in the SU(5)RN the large $\\mu\\to e\\gamma$ rate naturally\nfollows from the MSW large angle solution, and the predicted rate is beyond the\ncurrent experimental bound if the typical right-handed Majorana mass $M_N$ is\nlarger than $\\sim 10^{13}(\\sim 10^{14})$GeV for $\\tan\\beta=30(3)$, similarly to\nthe MSSMRN. We show the multimass insertion formulas and their applications to\n$\\tau\\to\\mu\\gamma$ and $\\mu\\to e\\gamma$.\n", "  In this Brief Report, a non-standard solution to the solar neutrino problem\nis revisited. This solution assumes that neutrino flavors could have different\ncouplings to gravity, hence, the equivalence principle is violated in this\nmechanism. The gravity induced mixing has the potential of accounting for the\ncurrent solar neutrino data from several experiments even for massless\nneutrinos. We fit this solution to the total rate of neutrino events in the\nSuperKamiokande detector together with the total rate from other detectors and\nalso with the most recent results of the SuperKamiokande results for the\nrecoil-electron spectrum.\n", "  We propose and study a common hierarchical mass texture for both charged\nlepton and neutrino sectors. The texture gives rise to a large\n$\\nu_\\mu\\leftrightarrow\\nu_\\tau$ mixing. Also it leads to the small angle MSW\neffect solution for solar neutrino data. It naturally gives a small\n$\\nu_e\\leftrightarrow \\nu_\\tau$ oscillation relevant to the CHOOZ result in\ncertain mass limits.\n", "  The light quarks inside $B$ mesons are usually treated as spectators and do\nnot affect the decay rates which are assumed to be purely due to b quark\ndecays. In this paper we calculate the non-spectator contributions to inclusive\ncharmless $B$ decays due to the spectator effects. We find that the\nnon-spectator contributions to the branching ratio for $\\bar B^0$ are small\n($<2\\times 10^{-4}$), but the contributions to $\\Delta S = 0$ and $\\Delta S =\n-1$, $B^-$ decay branching ratios can be as large as $-7.5\\times 10^{-4}$ and\n$2\\times 10^{-3}$, respectively. These contributions may play an important role\nin rare charmless $B$ decays.\n", "  Allowing leptoquarks to interact with both right-handed and left-handed\nneutrinos (i.e., ``non-chiral'' leptoquarks), we show that a non-zero neutrino\nmagnetic moment can arise naturally. Although the mass of the non-chiral vector\nleptoquark that couples to the first generation fermions is constrained\nseverely by universality of the $\\pi^+$ leptonic decays and is found to be\ngreater than 50 TeV, the masses of the second and third generation non-chiral\nvector leptoquarks may evade such constraint and may in general be in the range\nof $1\\sim 100$ TeV. With reasonable input mass and coupling values, we find\nthat the neutrino magnetic moment due to the second generation leptoquarks is\nof the order of $10^{-12}\\sim 10^{-16} \\mu_{\\rm B}$ while that caused by the\nthird generation leptoquarks, being enhanced significantly by the large top\nquark mass, is in the range of $10^{-10}\\sim 10^{-14} \\mu_{\\rm B}$.\n", "  The possibility of exploring the flavor changing neutral current\n$tcZ/tc\\gamma$ couplings in the production vertex for the reaction $\\epem\\to\nt\\bar c + \\bar tc$ is examined. Using a model independent parameterization for\nthe effective Lagrangian to describe the most general three-point interactions,\nproduction cross sections are found to be relatively small at LEP II, but\npotentially sizeable at higher energy \\epem colliders. The kinematic\ncharacteristics of the signal are studied and a set of cuts are devised for\nclean separation of the signal from background. The resulting sensitivity to\nanomalous flavor changing couplings at LEP II with an integrated luminosity of\n$4\\times 500$ pb$^{-1}$ is found to be comparable to their present indirect\nconstraints from loop processes, while at higher energy colliders with $0.5-1$\nTeV center-of-mass energy and 50-200 fb$^{-1}$ luminosity, one expects to reach\na sensitivity at or below the percentage level.\n", "  We consider the phenomenology of GMSB models where the lighter stau is the\nnext to lightest supersymmetric particle. In this situation, the dominant\nsignals for supersymmetry are events with two or three high p_T tau leptons\naccompanied by large missing transverse energy. We find that the inclusive two\ntau jets signature could be observable at the Tevatron's Run II, while the\ninclusive three tau jets signature could be important at Run III.\n", "  The chain of events usually understood to lead to the formation of\ntopological defects during phase transitions is known as the Kibble mechanism.\nA central component of the mechanism is the so-called ``geodesic rule''.\nAlthough in the Abelian Higgs model the validity of the geodesic rule has been\nquestioned recently, it is known to be valid on energetic grounds for a global\nU(1) symmetry breaking transition. However, even for these globally symmetric\nmodels no dynamical analisys of the rule has been carried to this date, and\nsome points as to how events proceed still remain obscure. This paper tries to\nclarify the dynamics of the geodesic rule in the context of a global U(1)\nmodel. With an appropriate ansatz for the field modulus we find a family of\nanalytical expressions, phase walls, that accounts for both geodesic and\nnongeodesic configurations. We then show how the latter ones are unstable and\ndecay into the former by nucleating pairs of defects. Finnally, we try to give\na physical perspective of how the geodesic rule might really work in these\ntransitions.\n", "  We investigate the effect on the sphaleron in the two Higgs doublet\nelectroweak theory of including CP violation in the Higgs potential. To have\nbetter control over the relation between the sphaleron energy and the physical\nquantities in the theory, we show how to parametrize the Higgs potential in\nterms of physical masses and mixing angles, one of which causes CP violation.\nBy altering this CP violating angle (and keeping the other physical quantities\nfixed) the sphaleron energy increases by up to 10%. We also calculate the\nstatic minimum energy path between adjacent vacua as a function of Chern-Simons\nnumber, using the method of gradient flow. The only effect CP violation has on\nthe barrier is the change in height. As a by-product of our work on\nparametrization of the potential, we demonstrate that CP violation in the Higgs\nsector favours nearly degenerate light Higgs masses.\n", "  The top condensate see-saw mechanism of Dobrescu and Hill allows electroweak\nsymmetry to be broken while deferring the problem of flavour to an electroweak\nsinglet, massive sector. We provide an extended version of the singlet sector\nthat naturally accommodates realistic masses for all the standard model\nfermions, which play an equal role in breaking electroweak symmetry. The models\nresult in a relatively light composite Higgs sector with masses typically in\nthe range of (400-700)~GeV. In more complete models the dynamics will\npresumably be driven by a broken gauged family or flavour symmetry group. As an\nexample of the higher scale dynamics a fully dynamical model of the quark\nsector with a GIM mechanism is presented, based on an earlier top condensation\nmodel of King using broken family gauge symmetry interactions (that model was\nitself based on a technicolour model of Georgi). The crucial extra ingredient\nis a reinterpretation of the condensates that form when several gauge groups\nbecome strong close to the same scale. A related technicolour model of Randall\nwhich naturally includes the leptons too may also be adapted to this scenario.\nWe discuss the low energy constraints on the massive gauge bosons and scalars\nof these models as well as their phenomenology at the TeV scale.\n", "  The technique of conformal mappings is applied to enlarge the convergence of\nthe Borel series and to accelerate the convergence of Borel-summed Green\nfunctions in perturbative QCD. We use the optimal mapping, which takes into\naccount the location of all the singularities of the Borel transform as well as\nthe present knowledge about its behaviour near the first branch points. The\ndetermination of \\alpha_{s}(m_{\\tau}) from the hadronic decay rate of the\n\\tau-lepton is discussed as an illustration of the method.\n", "  CP violation from physics beyond the Standard Model is investigated in\n$B_{l4}$ decays: $B\\to D\\pi l\\bar{\\nu}_l$. In the decay process, we include\nvarious excited states as intermediate states decaying to the final hadrons,\n$D+\\pi$. We consider the semileptonic decay to a tau lepton family as well. The\nCP violation is implemented through complex scalar--fermion couplings in the\nmulti-Higgs doublet model and scalar-leptoquark models beyond the Standard\nModel. With these complex couplings, we calculate the CP-odd rate asymmetry and\nthe optimal asymmetry. We find that for $B_{\\tau 4}$ decays the optimal\nasymmetry is sizable and can be detected at $1\\sigma$ level with about\n$10^6$-$10^7$ $B$-meson pairs, for maximally-allowed values of CP-odd\nparameters in those extended models.\n", "  The nontrivial structure of the neutrino mass matrix, suggested by the recent\nSuper-Kamiokande results and data from other neutrino experiments, can be\nreproduced in R-parity-violating supersymmetric theories. This requires sets of\nproducts of R-parity-violating trilinear couplings to take appropriately chosen\nvalues. It is shown that the existing constraints on these couplings are\nsatisfied by these choices.\n", "  We realize and study a model of hybrid inflation in the context of softly\nbroken supersymmetry. The inflaton is taken to be a flat direction in the\nsuperfield space and, due to unsuppressed couplings, its soft supersymmetry\nbreaking mass runs with scale. Both gauge and Yukawa couplings are taken into\naccount and different inflationary scenarios are investigated depending on the\nrelative strenght of the couplings and the mass spectrum.\n", "  We revisit the evaluation of the pionic mechanism of the\n$\\bar{u}-\\bar{d}$-asymmetry in the proton structure function. Our analysis is\nbased on the extended AGK unitarity relation between contributions of different\nmechanisms to the inclusive particle production and the total photoabsorption\ncross-section (i.e. the proton structure function). We reanalyze the role of\nisovector reggeons in inclusive production of nucleons and Delta isobars in\nhadronic reactions. We find rather large contribution of reggeon-exchange\ninduced production of Delta isobars. This leaves much less room for the\npion-exchange induced mechanism of $\\Delta$ production and provides a\nconstraint on the $\\pi N \\Delta$ form factor. The production of leading pions\nin proton-proton collisions at ISR puts additional constraints on the $\\pi NN$\nvertex form factors. An extension of the AGK-rules to reggeon exchange suggests\na negligible contribution to the proton structure function from DIS off the\nexchanged $\\rho,a_2$ reggeons. All these constraints are used then to estimate\nthe pion content of the nucleon and allow to calculate parameter-free the\n$x$-dependence of $\\bar d - \\bar u$. We discuss the violation of the Gottfried\nSum Rule and $\\bar d$-$\\bar u$ asymmetry and compare to the one obtained from\nthe E866 experiment at Fermilab. We estimate the background to the pion\nstructure function being determined by the ZEUS and H1 collaborations at HERA\nfrom leading neutron experiments.\n", "  We compute the deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) amplitude for forward\nand backward scattering in the asymptotic limit. Since this calculation does\nnot assume ordering of the transverse momenta, it includes important\nlogarithmic contributions that are beyond those summed by the DGLAP evolution.\nThese contributions lead to a power-like behavior for the forward DVCS\namplitude.\n", "  We investigate the contributions coming from the penguin operators in the\nnonresonant $B^- \\to M \\bar M \\pi^-$ ($M =\\pi^-, K^-, K^0$) decays. The\neffective Wilson coefficients of the the strong penguin operators $O_{4,6}$ are\nfound to be relatively larger. We calculate the contributions arising from the\n$O_4$ and $O_6$ operators in the nonresonant decays $B^- \\to M \\bar M\\pi^-$ ($M\n= \\pi^-, K^-, \\bar K^0$) using a model combining heavy quark symmetry and the\nchiral symmetry, developed previously. We find that the forbidden nonresonant\n$B^- \\to K^0 \\bar K^0 \\pi^-$ decay occurs through the strong penguin operators.\nThese penguin contributions affect the branching ratios for $B^- \\to M \\bar\nM\\pi^-$ ($M = \\pi^-, K^-$) by only a few percent. The branching ratio for $B^-\n\\to K^0 \\bar K^0 \\pi^-$ is estimated to be of the order $ 10^{-6}$.\n", "  It is quite plausible that the mass of the dark matter particle increases\nsignificantly after its freeze-out, due to a scalar field rolling to large\nvalues. We describe a realization of this scenario in the context of thermal\ninflation which naturally gives a cold dark matter particle with the correct\ncosmological abundance and a mass around $10^{10} {\\rm GeV}$, evading the\nconventional upper bound of $10^5 {\\rm GeV}$. We also discuss another\nrealization which could produce a cosmologically interesting abundance of near\nPlanck mass, possibly electromagnetically charged, particles. The detection and\nobservational consequences of superheavy cold dark matter or WIMPZILLAs are\nbriefly examined.\n", "  We argue that the Large Energy Effective Theory (LEET), originally proposed\nby Dugan and Grinstein, is applicable to exclusive semileptonic, radiative and\nrare heavy-to-light transitions in the region where the energy release E is\nlarge compared to the strong interaction scale and to the mass of the final\nhadron, i.e. for q^2 not close to the zero-recoil point. We derive the\nEffective Lagrangian from the QCD one, and show that in the limit of heavy mass\nM for the initial hadron and large energy E for the final one, the heavy and\nlight quark fields behave as two-component spinors. Neglecting QCD\nshort-distance corrections, this implies that there are only three form factors\ndescribing all the pseudoscalar to pseudoscalar or vector weak current matrix\nelements. We argue that the dependence of these form factors with respect to M\nand E should be factorizable, the M-dependence (sqrt(M)) being derived from the\nusual heavy quark expansion while the E-dependence is controlled by the\nbehaviour of the light-cone distribution amplitude near the end-point u=1. The\nusual expectation of the (1-u) behaviour leads to a 1/E^2 scaling law, that is\na dipole form in q^2. We also show explicitly that in the appropriate limit,\nthe Light-Cone Sum Rule method satisfies our general relations as well as the\nscaling laws in M and E of the form factors, and obtain very compact and simple\nexpressions for the latter. Finally we note that this formalism gives\ntheoretical support to the quark model-inspired methods existing in the\nliterature.\n", "  We use the LEP/SLD data to place constraints on Topcolor Assisted Technicolor\nModels. We find that due to a large negative shift in R_b induced by charged\ntop-pion exchange, it is difficult to make the models compatible with\nexperiment.\n", "  We consider the finite density, zero-temperature behaviour of quark matter in\nthe instanton picture. Since the instanton-induced interactions are attractive\nin both $\\bar{q}q$ and $qq$ channels, a competition ensues between phases of\nmatter with condensation in either or both. It results in chiral symmetry\nrestoration due to the onset of diquark condensation, a `colour supercondutor',\nat finite density. Also present is a state with both manners of condensation,\nhowever this phase is found to be thermodynamically disfavoured for equilibrium\nmatter. Properties of quark matter in each phase are discussed, with emphasis\non the microscopic effects of the effective mass and superconducting energy\ngap.\n", "  We calculate the quark part of the kernel of the generalized non-forward BFKL\nequation at non-zero momentum transfer $t$ in the next-to-leading logarithmic\napproximation. Along with the quark contribution to the gluon Regge trajectory,\nthis part includes pieces coming from the quark-antiquark production and from\nthe quark contribution to the radiative corrections in one-gluon production in\nthe Reggeon-Reggeon collisions. The results obtained can be used for an\narbitrary representation of the colour group in the $t-$channel. Using the\nresults for the adjoint representation, we demonstrate explicitly the\nfulfillment of the ``bootstrap'' condition for the gluon Reggeization in the\nnext-to-leading logarithmic approximation in the part concerning the quark\ncontribution.\n", "  We investigate the inclusive production of the Higgs bosons of the minimal\nsupersymmetric model with a heavy quark pair, ($t {\\bar t}$ and $b {\\bar b}$),\nin e^+e^- collisions at high energies, $\\sqrt{s}=500 GeV$ and $\\sqrt{s}=1 TeV$.\nThe ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_s)$ QCD radiative corrections are included and the\ndependence of the production rates on the parameters of the MSSM is explored.\nThe associated production of a Higgs boson with a $b {\\bar b}$ pair receives\nlarge resonant contributions and can have a significant rate.\n", "  We study the kinetics of the distribution function for charged particles of\nhard momentum in scalar QED. The goal is to understand the effects of infrared\ndivergences associated with the exchange of quasistatic magnetic photons in the\nrelaxation of the distribution function. We begin by obtaining a kinetic\ntransport equation for the distribution function for hard charged scalars in a\nperturbative expansion that includes hard thermal loop resummation. Solving\nthis transport equation, the infrared divergences arising from absorption and\nemission of soft quasi-static magnetic photons are manifest in logarithmic\nsecular terms. We then implement the dynamical renormalization group\nresummation of these secular terms in the relaxation time approximation. The\ndistribution function (in the linearized regime) is found to approach\nequilibrium as $\\delta n_k(t) =\\delta n_k(t_o) e^{-2\\alpha T (t-t_o)\n\\ln[(t-t_o)\\bar{\\mu}]}$, with $\\bar{\\mu}\\approx \\omega_p$ the plasma frequency\nand $\\alpha =e^2/4\\pi$. This anomalous relaxation is recognized to be the\nsquare of the relaxation of the single particle propagator, providing a\ngeneralization of the usual relation between the damping and the interaction\nrate. The renormalization group approach to kinetics reveals clearly the time\nscale $t_{rel} \\approx (\\alpha T \\ln[1/\\alpha])^{-1}$ arising from infrared\nphysics and hinges upon the separation of scales $t_{rel} >>\\omega_p^{-1}$.\n", "  We apply the perturbative QCD factorization theorem developed recently for\nnonleptonic heavy meson decays to the radiative decay $B\\to K^*\\gamma$. In this\nformalism the evolution of the Wilson coefficients from the $W$ boson mass down\nto the characteristic scale of the decay process is governed by the effective\nweak Hamiltonian. The evolution from the characteristic scale to a lower\nhadronic scale is formulated by the Sudakov resummation. Besides computing the\ndominant contribution arising from the magnetic-penguin operator $O_7$, we also\ncalculate the contributions of four-quark operators. By fitting our prediction\nfor the branching ratio of the $B\\to K^*\\gamma$ decay to the CLEO data, we\ndetermine the $B$ meson wave function, that possesses a sharp peak at a low\nmomentum fraction.\n", "  Widths for the new flavor changing top quark decay t-->c+sneutrino or for the\nreversed sneutrino decay sneutrino-->t+c(bar) are calculated in the MSSM\nwithout R-parity conservation. For large \\tan\\beta, e.g., \\tan\\beta ~ m_t/m_b ~\n40, Br(t-->c+sneutrino) > 10^{-5} or Br(sneutrino-->t+c(bar)) > 10^{-6} in a\nrelatively wide range of the supersymmetric parameter space as long as there is\nmore than one non-zero R-parity violating coupling. In the best cases, with a\ntypical squark mass around 100 GeV, we find that Br(t-->c+sneutrino) ~ 10^{-4}\n- 10^{-3} or Br(sneutrino-->t+c(bar)) ~ 10^{-5} - 10^{-4}. For \\tan\\beta ~ O(1)\nthe corresponding branching ratios for both top or sneutrino decays are too\nsmall to be measured at the LHC. Therefore, the decays t-->c+sneutrino or\nsneutrino-->t+c(bar) appear to be sensitive to \\tan\\beta and may be detected at\nthe LHC. The branching ratios of the corresponding decays to an up quark\ninstead of a charm quark, e.g., t-->u+sneutrino or sneutrino-->t+u(bar), may\nalso be similar.\n", "  Polarized photon structure can be studied in the future polarized\n$e^{+}e^{-}$ colliding-beam experiments. We investigate the spin-dependent\nstructure function of the virtual photon $g_1^{\\gamma}(x,Q^2,P^2)$, in\nperturbative QCD for $\\Lambda^2 \\ll P^2 \\ll Q^2$, where $-Q^2$ ($-P^2$) is the\nmass squared of the probe (target) photon. The analysis is performed to\nnext-to-leading order in QCD. We particularly emphasize the renormalization\nscheme independence of the result.The non-leading corrections significantly\nmodify the leading log result, in particular, at large $x$ as well as at small\n$x$. We also discuss the non-vanishing first moment sum rule of $g_1^\\gamma$,\nwhere ${\\cal O}(\\alpha_s)$ corrections are computed.\n", "  We first present a model-independent analysis using flavor SU(3) symmetry\nwith SU(3) breaking effects in $B$ decays to two charmless vector mesons ($VV$)\nin the final state. In order to bridge the flavor SU(3) symmetry approach and\nthe factorization approach in $B \\to VV$ decays, we explicitly show how to\ntranslate each SU(3) amplitude into a corresponding amplitude in factorization.\nVarious decay modes, including $B \\to K^* \\phi$ which is so far the only $B \\to\nVV$ mode having some experimental evidence, are discussed in both the SU(3)\nsymmetry and factorization approaches. Within the generalized factorization\napproximation, the flavor SU(3) amplitudes and SU(3) breaking effects are\nnumerically estimated as a function of the parameter $\\xi \\equiv 1/ N_c$ ($N_c$\nthe effective number of color).\n", "  The neutral current effects of the future high statistics atmospheric\nneutrino data can be used to distinguish the mechanisms between a $\\nu_\\mu$\noscillation to a tau neutrino or to a sterile neutrino. However, if neutrinos\npossess large diagonal and/or transition magnetic moments, the neutrino\nmagnetic moments can contribute to the neutral current effects which can be\nstudied by the single $\\pi^0$ production events in the Super-K data. This\neffect should be included in the future analyses of atmospheric data in the\ndetermination of $\\nu_\\mu$ to tau or sterile neutrino oscillation.\n", "  Quasiopenness seems to be generic to multi-field models of single-bubble open\ninflation. Instead of producing infinite open universes, these models actually\nproduce an ensemble of very large but finite inflating islands. In this paper\nwe study the possible constraints from CMB anisotropies on existing models of\nopen inflation. The effect of supercurvature anisotropies combined with the\nquasiopenness of the inflating regions make some models incompatible with\nobservations, and severely reduces the parameter space of others. Supernatural\nopen inflation and the uncoupled two-field model seem to be ruled out due to\nthese constraints for values of $\\Omega_0\\lesssim0.98$. Others, such as the\nopen hybrid inflation model with suitable parameters for the slow roll\npotential can be made compatible with observations.\n", "  It has been recently suggested by Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos and Dvali that\ngravity may become strong at energies not far above the electroweak scale and\nthus remove the hierarchy problem. Such a scenario can be tested at both\npresent and future accelerators since towers of Kaluza-Klein gravitons and\nassociated scalar fields now play an important phenomenological role. In this\npaper we examine several processes for their sensitivity to a low scale for\nquantum gravity including deep inelastic $ep$ scattering at HERA, high\nprecision low energy $\\nu N$ scattering, Bhabha and Moller scattering at linear\ncolliders and both fermion and gluon pair production at $\\gamma \\gamma$\ncolliders.\n", "  We describe a computational investigation of tunneling at finite energy in a\nweakly coupled quantum mechanical system with two degrees of freedom. We\ncompare a full quantum mechanical analysis to the results obtained by making\nuse of a semiclassical technique developed in the context of instanton-like\ntransitions in quantum field theory. This latter technique is based on an\nanalytic continuation of the degrees of freedom into a complex phase space, and\nthe simultaneous analytic continuation of the equations of motion into the\ncomplex time plane.\n", "  If, in addition to the standard model fields, a new pseudoscalar field exists\nand couples to hypercharge topological number density, it can exponentially\namplify hyperelectric and hypermagnetic fields in the symmetric phase of the\nelectroweak plasma, while coherently rolling or oscillating. We present the\nequations describing the coupled system of a pseudoscalar field and hypercharge\nelectromagnetic fields in the electroweak plasma at temperatures above the\nelectroweak phase transition, discuss approximations to the equations, and\ntheir validity. We then solve the approximate equations using assorted\nanalytical and numerical methods, and determine the parameters for which\nhypercharge electromagnetic fields can be exponentially amplified.\n", "  The most general Two Higgs Doublet Model potential without explicit CP\nviolation depends on 10 real independent parameters. There are two different\nways of restricting this potential to 7 independent parameters. This gives rise\nto two different potentials, $V_{(A)}$ and $V_{(B)}$. The phenomenology of the\ntwo models is different, because some trilinear and quartic Higgs couplings are\ndifferent. As an illustration, we calculate the decay width of $h^0 \\to \\gamma\n\\gamma$, where precisely due to the different trilinear couplings the loop of\nthe charged Higgs gives different contributions. We also discuss the\npossibility for the existence of a light fermiophobic Higgs.\n", "  New experimental measurements are used to test model independent sum rules\nfor charmed baryon masses. Sum rules for medium-strong mass differences are\nfound to be reasonably well satisfied with increasing accuracy, and the new\nmeasurements permit an improved prediction of $2778\\pm 9$ MeV for the mass of\nthe $\\Omega_c^{*0}$. But an isospin breaking sum rule for the $\\Sigma_c$ mass\nsplittings is still in significant disagreement posing a serious problem for\nthe quark model of charmed baryons. Individual $\\Sigma_c$ mass splittings are\ninvestigated, using the new CLEO measurement of the $\\Xi_c^\\prime$ mass\nsplitting, but the accuracy is not yet sufficient for a good test.\n", "  The density of extended topological defects created during symmetry-breaking\nphase transitions depends on the ratio between the correlation length in the\nsymmetric phase near $T_c$ and the winding length of the defects as determined\nby the momentaneous effective action after a typical relaxation time.\nConservation of winding number in numerical simulations requires a suitable\nembedding of the field variables and the appropriate geometrical implementation\nof the winding density on the discrete lattice. We define a modified Kibble\nlimit for the square lattice and obtain defect densities as functions of\nwinding lengths in O(2) and O(3) models. The latter allows to observe formation\nof disoriented aligned domains within the easy plane. Their extent is severely\nlimited by the momentaneous defect density during the course of the quench.\n", "  Electromagnetic emission rates from a thermalized hadronic gas are important\nfor the interpretation of dilepton signals from heavy-ion collisions. Although\nthere is a consensus in the literature about rates for a pure meson gas,\nqualitative differences appear with a finite baryon density. We show this to be\nessentially due to the way in which the pi-N background is treated in regards\nto the nucleon resonances. Using a background constrained by unitarity and\nbroken chiral symmetry, it is emphasized that the thermalized hadronic gas can\nbe considered dilute.\n", "  By using the effective potential approximation and taking into account the\ndominant top quark and scalar top quark loops, radiative corrections to MSSM\nHiggs potential are computed in the presence of the supersymmetric CP-violating\nphases. It is found that, the lightest Higgs scalar remains essentially CP-even\nas in the CP-invariant theory whereas the other two scalars are heavy and do\nnot have definite CP properties. The supersymmetric CP-violating phases are\nshown to modify significantly the decay rates of the scalars to fermion pairs.\n", "  Recent concerns about the very large next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL)\ncorrections to the BFKL equation are addressed by the introduction of a\nphysical rapidity-separation parameter $\\Delta$. At the leading logarithm (LL)\nthis parameter enforces the constraint that successive emitted gluons have a\nminimum separation in rapidity, $y_{i+1}-y_i>\\Delta$. The most significant\neffect is to reduce the BFKL Pomeron intercept from the standard result as\n$\\Delta$ is increased from 0 (standard BFKL). At NLL this $\\Delta$-dependence\nis compensated by a modification of the BFKL kernel, such that the total\ndependence on $\\Delta$ is formally next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic. In this\nformulation, as long as $\\Delta\\gtrsim2.2$ (for $\\alpha_{s}=0.15$): (i) the NLL\nBFKL pomeron intercept is stable with respect to variations of $\\Delta$, and\n(ii) the NLL correction is small compared to the LL result. Implications for\nthe applicability of the BFKL resummation to phenomenology are considered.\n", "  We reanalyze our recently proposed mass matrix model based on spontaneously\nbroken discrete chiral family symmetry, taking into account the additional\nflavor changing neutral current constraint implied by the bound on the\n$D_1-D_2$ mass difference, and including several corrections to our earlier\nanalysis. When combined, the $K_1-K_2$ and $D_1-D_2$ constraints force the\nmasses of the Higgs particles that contribute most strongly to flavor changing\nneutral currents (the $\\phi$ Higgs states) to lie above 17 TeV, well beyond the\nlimit of validity of conventional perturbative Higgs physics. The analogous\nconstraints on the masses of the $\\eta$ Higgs states and the neutral pseudo\nGoldstone Higgs state depend on the mechanism for realizing small first family\nmasses. If the $\\eta$ Higgs is the primary contributor to second family masses,\nthe pseudo Goldstone and $\\eta$ Higgs states must have masses above 220 GeV,\nwith numerical fits suggesting masses above 1 TeV, while if the $\\eta$ Higgs is\nresponsible solely for first family masses, the corresponding mass bounds drop\nto the range detectable at the LHC. We show that naturalness of small first\nfamily masses favors the latter alternative, and give an illustrative mass\nmatrix texture model.\n", "  Starting from the effective lagrangian for QCD at high energy we calculate\nthe lowest perturbative contributions to the potential of a relativistic\nnucleus and compare our results to those derived by Kovchegov (see Y.V.\nKovchegov, Phys. Rev. {\\bf D55}, 5445 (1997)). The results differ already at\norder g^3 which can be traced to the fact that the meaning of the underlying\ngluon fields is different. (The effective gluon field we use is a gauge\ninvariant object.) Both approaches should therefore be seen as alternatives,\nthe relative merits of which have to be judged by their phenomenological\nsuccess.\n", "  We discuss possible origins of transverse spin asymmetries in hadron-hadron\ncollisions and propose an explanation in terms of a chiral-odd T-odd\ndistribution function with intrinsic transverse momentum dependence, which\nwould signal a correlation between the transverse spin and the transverse\nmomentum of quarks inside an unpolarized hadron. We will argue that despite its\nconceptual problems, it can account for single spin asymmetries, for example in\np + p(transversely polarized) -> pion + X, and at the same time for the large\ncos(2 phi) asymmetry in the unpolarized Drell-Yan cross section, which still\nlacks understanding. We use the latter asymmetry to arrive at a crude model for\nthis function and show explicitly how it relates unpolarized and polarized\nobservables in the Drell-Yan process, as could be measured with the\nproton-proton collisions at RHIC. Moreover, it would provide an alternative\nmethod of accessing the transversity distribution function h_1. For future\nreference we also list the complete set of azimuthal asymmetries in the\nunpolarized and polarized Drell-Yan process at leading order involving T-odd\ndistribution functions with intrinsic transverse momentum dependence.\n", "  We study the preheating scenario in Generalized Einstein Theories,\nconsidering a class of such theories which are conformally equivalent to those\nof an extra field with a modified potential in the Einstein frame. Resonant\ncreation of bosons from oscillating inflaton has been studied before in the\ncontext of general relativity taking also into account the effect of metric\nperturbations in linearized gravity. As a natural generalization we include the\ndilatonic/Brans-Dicke field without any potential of its own and in particular\nwe study the linear theory of perturbations including the metric perturbations\nin the longitudinal gauge. We show that there is an amplification of the\nperturbations in the dilaton/Brans-Dicke field on super-horizon scales (k -> 0)\ndue to the fluctuations in metric, thus leading to an oscillating Newton's\nconstant with very high frequency within the horizon and with growing amplitude\noutside the horizon. We briefly mention the entropy perturbations generated by\nsuch fluctuations and also mention that there is a possibility to excite the\nKaluza-Klein modes in the theories where the dilatonic/Brans-Dicke field is\ninterpreted as a homogeneous field appearing due to the dimensional reduction\nfrom the higher dimensional theories.\n", "  We study the reactions $\\gamma^*(Q^2)p\\to\\rho^0 p$ and\n$\\gamma^*(Q^2)p\\to\\gamma^*(Q^2) p$ at large Q^2 and $W^2/Q^2$ and small\nmomentum transfer, $\\kappa^2_\\perp$, to the nucleon where the pomeron exchange\ndominates. At large Q^2 the virtual photon selects a hard $q\\bar q$ pair, thus\nselecting the hard pomeron component (the BFKL pomeron). The amplitudes for\nboth transverse and longitudinal polarizations of the initial photon and\noutgoing $\\rho$-meson (photon) are calculated in the framework of the BFKL\npomeron exchange. Our calculations show that one cannot expect the early onset\nof the pure perturbative regime in the discussed diffractive processes: the\nsmall interquark distances, $\\rho_{q\\bar q} <0.2$ fm, start to dominate not\nearlier than at $Q^2 \\simeq 100 GeV^2, W^2/Q^2 \\simeq 10^7$ in\n$\\gamma^*(Q^2)p\\to\\rho^0 p$ and $Q^2 \\simeq 50 GeV^2, W^2/Q^2 \\simeq 10^6$ in\n$\\gamma^*(Q^2)p\\to\\gamma^*(Q^2) p$.\n", "  The partial Higgs width $\\Gamma (H \\longrightarrow \\gamma \\gamma)$ is\nimportant at the LHC for Higgs masses in the MSSM mass window up to 140 GeV as\na relatively background free signal of a fundamental scalar. At the photon\nphoton mode at the NLC it would be the Higgs production mechanism . Two loop\nQCD corrections exist for the fermionic contribution and in the case of the\nbottom loop large non-Sudakov double logarithms can be resummed to all orders\nand contribute up to 12 % compared to the t-quark. In more complicated Higgs\nsectors, such as in the MSSM, large $\\tan \\beta$ enhancements of bottom type\nYukawa couplings can potentially dominate even the whole partial width. A main\nuncertainty in all existing calculations is the scale of the strong coupling as\nit is only renormalized at the three loop level. In this paper we include the\nexact two loop running coupling to all orders into the bottom contribution. We\nfind that the effective scale is close to $\\alpha_s (10 m_b^2)$.\n", "  An intuitive approach to the glueball using the flux-tube ring solution in\nthe dual Ginzburg-Landau theory is presented. The description of the flux-tube\nring as the relativistic closed string with the effective string tension\nenables us to write the hamiltonian of the flux-tube ring using the Nambu-Goto\naction. Analyzing the Schr\\\"odinger equation, we discuss the mass spectrum and\nthe wave function of the glueball. The lowest glueball state is found to have\nthe mass $M_G \\sim 1.6 GeV$ and the size $R_G \\sim 0.5 fm$.\n", "  We present a novel scenario for baryogenesis in a hybrid inflation model at\nthe electroweak scale, in which the Standard Model Higgs field triggers the end\nof inflation. One of the conditions for successful baryogenesis, the departure\nfrom thermal equilibrium, is naturally achieved at the stage of preheating\nafter inflation. The inflaton oscillations induce large occupation numbers for\nlong-wavelength configurations of Higgs and gauge fields, which leads to a\nlarge rate of sphaleron transitions. We estimate this rate during the first\nstages of reheating and evaluate the amount of baryons produced due to a\nparticular type of higher dimensional CP violating operator. The universe\nthermalizes through fermion interactions, at a temperature below critical,\n$T_{rh} < 100$ GeV, preventing the wash-out of the produced baryon asymmetry.\nNumerical simulations in (1+1) dimensions support our theoretical analysis.\n", "  Global fits to all data of candidates for neutrino oscillations are presented\nin the framework of a three-flavor model. The analysis excludes mass regions\nwhere the MSW effect is important for the solar neutrino problem. The best fit\ngives $\\theta_1 \\approx 28.9^\\circ, \\theta_2 \\approx 4.2^\\circ, \\theta_3\n\\approx 45.0^\\circ, m_2^2 - m_1^2 \\approx 2.87 \\cdot 10^{-4} eV^2$, and $m_3^2\n- m_2^2 \\approx 1.11 eV^2$ indicating essentially maximal mixing between the\ntwo lightest neutrino mass eigenstates.\n", "  A Higgs boson with mass below 150 GeV has a total decay width of less than 20\nMeV into accessible Standard Model states. This narrow width means that the\nusual branching fractions for such a light Higgs boson are highly susceptible\nto any new particles to which it has unsuppressed couplings. In particular,\nthere are many reasonable and interesting theoretical ideas that naturally\nimply an invisibly-decaying Higgs boson. The motivations include models with\nlight supersymmetric neutralinos, spontaneously broken lepton number,\nradiatively generated neutrino masses, additional singlet scalar(s), or\nright-handed neutrinos in the extra dimensions of TeV gravity. We discuss these\napproaches to model building and their implications for Higgs boson\nphenomenology in future Tevatron runs. We find, for example, that the Tevatron\nwith 30 fb^{-1} integrated luminosity can make a 3\\sigma observation in the l+\nl- plus missing transverse energy channel for a 125 GeV Higgs boson that is\nproduced with the same strength as the Standard Model Higgs boson but always\ndecays invisibly. We also analyze the b anti-b plus missing transverse energy\nfinal state signal and conclude that it is not as sensitive, but it may assist\nin excluding the possibility of an invisibly-decaying Higgs boson or enable\nconfirmation of an observed signal in the dilepton channel. We argue that a\ncomprehensive Higgs search at the Tevatron should include the possibility that\nthe Higgs boson decays invisibly.\n", "  We discuss QCD condensate contributions to the gluon propagator both in the\nfixed-point gauge and in covariant gauges for the external QCD vacuum gluon\nfields with the conclusion that a covariant gauge is essential to obtain a\ngauge invariant QCD vacuum energy density difference and to retain the\nunitarity of the quark scattering amplitude. The gauge-invariant QCD condensate\ncontributions to the effective one-gluon exchange potential are evaluated by\nusing the effective gluon propagator which produces a gauge-independent quark\nscattering amplitude.\n", "  The event-by-event fluctuations of suitably chosen observables in heavy ion\ncollisions at SPS, RHIC and LHC can tell us about the thermodynamic properties\nof the hadronic system at freeze-out. By studying these fluctuations as a\nfunction of varying control parameters, it is possible to learn much about the\nphase diagram of QCD. As a timely example, we stress the methods by which\npresent experiments at the CERN SPS can locate the second-order critical\nendpoint of the first-order transition between quark-gluon plasma and hadron\nmatter. Those event-by-event signatures which are characteristic of freeze-out\nin the vicinity of the critical point will exhibit nonmonotonic dependence on\ncontrol parameters. We focus on observables constructed from the multiplicity\nand transverse momenta of charged pions. We first consider how the\nevent-by-event fluctuations of such observables are affected by Bose-Einstein\ncorrelations, by resonances which decay after freeze-out and by fluctuations in\nthe transverse flow velocity. We compare our thermodynamic predictions for such\nnoncritical event-by-event fluctuations with NA49 data, finding broad\nagreement. We then focus on effects due to thermal contact between the observed\npions and a heat bath with a given (possibly singular) specific heat, and due\nto the direct coupling between the critical fluctuations of the sigma field and\nthe observed pions. We also discuss the effect of the pions produced in the\ndecay of sigma particles just above threshold after freeze-out on the inclusive\npion spectrum and on multiplicity fluctuations. We estimate the size of these\nnonmonotonic effects which appear near the critical point, including\nrestrictions imposed by finite size and finite time, and conclude that they\nshould be easily observable.\n", "  If a heavy Dirac monopole exists, the light-to-light scattering below the\nmonopole production threshold is enhanced due to strong coupling of monopoles\nto photons. At the next Linear Collider with electron beam energy 250 GeV this\nphoton pair production could be observable at monopole masses less than 2.5-6.4\nTeV in the $e^+e^-$ mode or 3.7-10 TeV in the $\\gamma\\gamma$ mode, depending on\nthe monopole spin. At the upgraded Tevatron such an effect is expected to be\nvisible at monopole masses below 1-2.5 TeV. The strong dependence on the\ninitial photon polarizations allows to find the monopole spin in experiments at\n$e^+e^-$ and $\\gamma\\gamma$ colliders. We consider the $Z\\gamma$ production and\nthe $3\\gamma$ production at $e^+e^-$ and $pp$ or $p\\bar{p}$ colliders via the\nsame monopole loop. The possibility to discover these processes is\nsignificantly lower than that of the $\\gamma\\gamma$ case.\n", "  We examine signals for sparticle production at the Tevatron within the\nframework of gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking models for four different\nmodel lines, each of which leads to qualitatively different signatures. We\nidentify cuts to enhance the signal above Standard Model backgrounds, and use\nISAJET to evaluate the SUSY reach of experiments at the Fermilab Main Injector\nand at the proposed TeV33. For the model lines that we have examined, we find\nthat the reach is at least as large, and frequently larger, than in the mSUGRA\nframework. For two of these model lines, we find that the ability to identify\n$b$-quarks and $\\tau$-leptons with high efficiency and purity is essential for\nthe detection of the signal.\n", "  In this letter we present a predictive SO(10) SUSY GUT with flavor symmetry\nU(2) \\times U(1) which has several nice features. We are able to fit fermion\nmasses and mixing angles, including recent neutrino data, with 9 parameters in\nthe charged fermion sector and 4 in the neutrino sector. The flavor symmetry\nplays a preeminent role -- (i) The model is \"natural\" -- we include all terms\nallowed by the symmetry. It restricts the number of arbitrary parameters and\nenforces many zeros in the effective mass matrices. (ii) Flavor symmetry\nbreaking from U(2) \\times U(1) \\to U(1) \\to nothing generates the family\nhierarchy. It also constrains squark and slepton mass matrices, thus\nameliorating flavor violation resulting from squark and slepton loop\ncontributions. (iii) Finally, it naturally gives large angle $\\nu_\\mu -\n\\nu_\\tau$ mixing describing atmospheric neutrino oscillation data and small\nangle $\\nu_e - \\nu_{s}$ mixing consistent with the small mixing angle MSW\nsolution to solar neutrino data.\n", "  We discuss the choice of gauge field basis in multiple-U(1) gauge theories.\nWe find that there is a preferred basis, specified by the charge orthogonality\ncondition, in which the U(1) gauge fields do not mix under one-loop\nrenormalization group running.\n", "  We discuss the production and decay rates of the lightest color-singlet\ntechnihadrons, spin-one rho_T and omega_T and spin-zero pi_T, in a minimal\n``straw-man'' model of low-scale techicolor. The revised rho_T and omega_T\ndecay rates affect the technicolor searches planned for Run II of the Tevatron\nCollider.\n", "  Two-body charmless nonleptonic decays of B_u and B_d mesons are studied\nwithin the framework of generalized factorization in which the effective Wilson\ncoefficients $c^{eff}_i$ are renormalization-scale and -scheme independent\nwhile factorization is applied to the tree-level hadronic matrix elements.\nContrary to previous studies, our $c_i^{eff}$ do not suffer from gauge and\ninfrared problems. Nonfactorizable effects are parametrized in terms of N_c(LL)\nand N_c(LR), the effective numbers of colors arising from (V-A)(V-A) and\n(V-A)(V+A) four-quark operators, respectively. Tree and penguin transitions are\nclassified into six different classes. The data of $B^-\\to\\rho^0\\pi^-$ and\n$B^-\\to\\phi K^-$ clearly indicate that $N_c(LR)\\neq N_c(LL)$: The first\nmeasurement of the b -> u mode $B^-\\to\\rho^0\\pi^-$ and the experimental\ninformation on the tree-dominated mode $B^-\\to\\omega\\pi^-$ all imply that\nNc(LL) is less than 3, whereas the CLEO measurement of $B^-\\to\\phi K^-$ shows\nNc(LR)>3. For given input parameters, the prediction of ${\\cal B}(B\\to\\eta' K)$\nis largely improved by setting Nc(LL)~2 and Nc(LR)>Nc(LL); in particular, the\ncharm content of the eta' contributes in the right direction. The decay rate of\n$B\\to\\phi K^*$ is very sensitive to the form-factor ratio A_2/A_1; the absence\nof $B\\to\\phi K$ events does not necessarily invalidate the factorization\napproach. If the branching ratio of $B^-\\to\\omega K^-$ is experimentally found\nto be significantly larger than that of $B^-\\to\\rho^0 K^-$, we argue that\ninelastic final-state rescattering may account for the disparity between\n$\\omega K^-$ and $\\rho^0 K^-$.\n", "  Recently full O(alpha_s^2, alpha_s*beta, beta^2) corrections to the threshold\ntotal cross section for e+e- to ttbar have been calculated, and the reported\ncorrections turned out to be unexpectedly large. We study how to reduce\ntheoretical uncertainties of the cross section. We adopt a new mass definition\nproposed by Beneke, which incorporates a renormalon-pole cancellation in the\ntotal energy of a static quark-antiquark pair. This improves the convergence of\nthe 1S resonance mass, while the normalization of the cross section scarcely\nchanges. We argue that resummations of logarithms are indispensable, since two\nlargely separated scales dictate the shape of the cross section. As a first\nstep, we resum logarithms in the Coulombic part of the t-tbar potential and\nobserve a considerable improvement in the convergence of corresponding\ncorrections. There still remain, however, large corrections, which arise from a\n1/r^2 term in the ttbar potential. We also calculate full O(alpha_s^2,\nalpha_s*beta, beta^2) corrections to the momentum distributions of top quarks\nin the threshold region. Corrections to the distribution shape are small on the\n1S resonance. At higher energies, corrections become larger.\n", "  We present universal factorization formulas describing the behavior of\none-loop QCD amplitudes as external momenta become either soft or collinear.\nOur results are valid to all orders in the dimensional regularization\nparameter, $\\eps$. Terms through $\\Ord(\\eps^2)$ can contribute in infrared\ndivergent phase space integrals associated with next-to-next-to-leading order\njet cross-sections.\n", "  We present a general analysis of the effective potential for neutrino\npropagation in matter, assuming a generic set of Lorentz invariant\nnon-derivative interactions. We find that in addition to the known vector and\naxial vector terms, in a polarized medium also tensor interactions can play an\nimportant role. We compute the effective potential arising from a tensor\ninteraction. We show that the components of the tensor potential transverse to\nthe direction of the neutrino propagation can induce a neutrino spin-flip,\nsimilar to the one induced by a transverse magnetic field.\n", "  The time-dependent angular distributions of certain $B_{d,s}$ decays into\nfinal states that are admixtures of CP-even and CP-odd configurations provide\nvaluable information about CKM phases and hadronic parameters. We present the\ngeneral formalism to accomplish this task, taking also into account penguin\ncontributions, and illustrate it by considering a few specific decay modes. We\ngive particular emphasis to the decay $B_d\\to J/\\psi \\rho^0$, which can be\ncombined with $B_s\\to J/\\psi \\phi$ to extract the $B^0_d - \\bar{B^0_d}$ mixing\nphase and - if penguin effects in the former mode should be sizeable - also the\nangle $\\gamma$ of the unitarity triangle. As an interesting by-product, this\nstrategy allows us to take into account also the penguin effects in the\nextraction of the $B^0_s - \\bar{B^0_s}$ mixing phase from $B_s\\to J/\\psi \\phi$.\nMoreover, a discrete ambiguity in the extraction of the CKM angle $\\beta$ can\nbe resolved, and valuable insights into SU(3)-breaking effects can be obtained.\nOther interesting applications of the general formalism presented in this\npaper, involving $B_d\\to\\rho \\rho$ and $B_{s,d}\\to K^{\\ast} \\bar{K^\\ast}$\ndecays, are also briefly noted.\n", "  The scattering amplitude in the dual model with Mandelstam analyticity and\ntrajectory $\\alpha (s)=\\alpha_{0}-\\gamma \\ln [ (1+\\beta \\sqrt{s_{0} -s})/(1+\n\\beta \\sqrt{s_{0}})]$ is studied in the limit $s,|t|\\to \\infty, s/t=const.$ By\nusing the saddle point method, a series decomposition for the scattering\namplitude is obtained, with the leading and two sub-leading terms calculated\nexplicitly.\n", "  Recently, the final state strong interactions in nonleptonic B decays were\ninvestigated in a formalism based on hadronic unitarity and dispersion\nrelations in terms of the off-shell mass squared of the $B$ meson. We consider\nan heuristic derivation of the dispersion relations in the mass variables using\nthe reduction LSZ formalism and find a discrepancy between the spectral\nfunction and the dispersive variable used in the recent works. The part of the\nunitarity sum which describes final state interactions is shown to appear as\nspectral function in a dispersion relation based on the analytic continuation\nin the mass squared of one final particles. As an application, by combining\nthis formalism with Regge theory and SU(3) flavour symmetry we obtain\nconstraints on the tree and the penguin amplitudes of the decay $B^0\\to\n\\pi^+\\pi^-$.\n", "  The pseudo-Goldstone boson mechanism for the ``doublet-triplet splitting''\nproblem of the grand unified theory can be naturally implemented in the\nscenario with extra dimensions and branes. The two SU(6) global symmetries of\nthe Higgs sector are located on two separate branes while the SU(6) gauge\nsymmetry is in the bulk. After including several vector-like fields in the\nbulk, and allowing the most general interactions with their natural strength\n(including the higher dimensional ones which may be generated by gravity) which\nare consistent with the geometry, a realistic pattern of the Standard Model\nfermion masses and mixings can be naturally obtained without any flavor\nsymmetry. Neutrino masses and mixings required for the solar and atmospheric\nneutrino problems can also be accommodated. The geometry of extra dimensions\nand branes provides another way to realize the absence of certain interactions\n(as required in the pseudo-Goldstone boson mechanism) or the smallness of some\ncouplings (e.g., the Yukawa couplings between the fermions and the Higgs\nbosons), in addition to the usual symmetry arguments.\n", "  We study the viscosity corrections to the growth rate of nucleating bubbles\nin a first order phase transition in scalar field theory. We obtain the\nnon-equilibrium equation of motion of the coordinate that describes small\ndepartures from the critical bubble and extract the growth rate consistently in\nweak coupling and in the thin wall limit. Viscosity effects arise from the\ninteraction of this coordinate with the stable quantum and thermal fluctuations\naround a critical bubble. In the case of 1+1 dimensions we provide an estimate\nfor the growth rate that depends on the details of the free energy functional.\nIn 3+1 dimensions we recognize robust features that are a direct consequence of\nthe thin wall approximation and give the leading viscosity corrections.These\nare long-wavelength hydrodynamic fluctuations that describe surface waves,\nquasi-Goldstone modes which are related to ripples on interfaces in phase\nordered Ising-like systems. We discuss the applicability of our results to\ndescribe the growth rate of hadron bubbles in a quark-hadron first order\ntransition.\n", "  We consider some consequences of the presence of a cosmological lepton\nasymmetry in the form of neutrinos. Relic neutrino degeneracy enhances the\ncontribution of massive neutrinos to the present energy density of the\nUniverse, and modifies the power spectrum of radiation and matter. Comparing\nwith current observations of cosmic microwave background anisotropies and large\nscale structure, we derive some constraints on the neutrino degeneracy and on\nthe spectral index in the case of a flat Universe with a cosmological constant.\n", "  We reconsider the evolution equations for multigluon correlators derived in\nhep-ph/9709432. We show how to derive these equations directly in terms of\nvector potentials (or colour field strength) avoiding the introduction of the\nconcept of colour charge density in the intermediate steps. The two step\nprocedure of deriving the evolution of the charge density correlators followed\nby the solution of classical equations for the vector potentials is shown to be\nconsistent with direct derivation of evolution for vector potentials. In the\nprocess we correct some computational errors of hep-ph/9709432 and present the\ncorrected evolution equations which have a somewhat simpler appearance.\n", "  The processes $\\gamma\\gamma\\to\\pi^0\\pi^0\\pi^0$ and $\\gamma\\gamma\\to \\pi^+\n\\pi^- \\pi^0$ are considered in Generalized Chiral Perturbation theory, in view\nof their potential sensitivity to the mechanism of spontaneous breaking of\nchiral symmetry and to various counterterms. The amplitudes are computed up to\norder ${\\cal O}(p^6)$. The event production rates are estimated for the Daphne\n$\\phi$-Factory and for a future $\\tau$-Charm Factory.\n", "  Direct CP violations in $B_{l4}$ decays ($B^\\pm \\to \\pi^+\\pi^- l^\\pm\n{\\nu}_l$) are investigated within the Standard Model (SM) and also in its\nextensions. In the decay processes, we include various excited states as\nintermediate states decaying to the final hadrons, $\\pi^+ + \\pi^-$. The CP\nviolation within the SM is induced by the interferences between intermediate\nresonances with different quark flavors. As extensions of the SM, we consider\nCP violations implemented through complex scalar-fermion couplings in the\nmulti-Higgs doublet model and the scalar-leptoquark models. We calculate the\nCP-odd rate asymmetry and the optimal asymmetry. We find that the optimal\nasymmetry can be measured at $1\\sigma$ level with about $10^9$ $B$-meson pairs\nin the SM case and $10^3$--$10^7$ pairs in the extended model case, for\nmaximally-allowed values of CP-odd parameters in each case.\n", "  We analyze the structure of the vacuum polarization tensor in the presence of\na background electromagnetic field in a medium. We use various discrete\nsymmetries and crossing symmetry to constrain the form factors obtained for the\nmost general case. From these symmetry arguments, we show why the vacuum\npolarization tensor has to be even in the background field when there is no\nbackground medium. Taking then the background field to be purely magnetic, we\nevaluate the vacuum polarization to linear order in it. The result shows the\nphenomenon of Faraday rotation, i.e., the rotation of the plane of polarization\nof a plane polarized light passing through this background. We find that the\nusual expression for Faraday rotation, which is derived for a non-degenerate\nplasma in the non-relativistic approximation, undergoes substantial\nmodification if the background is degenerate and/or relativistic. We give\nexplicit expressions for Faraday rotation in completely degenerate and\nultra-relativistic media.\n", "  Recent results on solar neutrinos provide hints that the LMA MSW solution\ncould be correct. We perform accurate calculations for potential `smoking-gun'\neffects of the LMA solution in the SuperKamiokande solar neutrino experiment,\nincluding: (1) an almost constant reduction of the standard recoil electron\nenergy spectrum (with a weak, < 10%, relative increase below 6.5 MeV); (2) an\nintegrated difference in day-night rates (2% to 14%); (3) an approximately\nconstant zenith-angle dependence of the nighttime event rate; (4) a new test\nfor the difference in the shape of the equally-normalized day-night energy\nspectra (~ 1%); and (5) annual variations of the signal due to the regeneration\neffect (~ 6 times smaller than the integrated day-night effect). We also\nestablish a relation between the integrated day-night asymmetry and the\nseasonal asymmetry due to LMA regeneration. As a cautionary example, we\nsimulate the effect of an absolute energy calibration error on the shape\n(distortion) of the recoil energy spectrum. We compare LMA predictions with\nSuperKamiokande data and discuss the possibilities for distinguishing\nexperimentally between LMA and vacuum oscillations.\n", "  We solve numerically for periodic, spherically symmetric, classical solutions\nof SU(2)-Higgs theory in four-dimensional Euclidean space. In the limit of\nshort periods the solutions approach tiny instanton-anti-instanton\nsuperpositions while, for longer periods, the solutions merge with the static\nsphaleron. A previously predicted bifurcation point, where two branches of\nperiodic solutions meet, appears for Higgs boson masses larger than $3.091\nM_W$.\n", "  In the gauge-mediation framework the soft supersymmetry breaking mass\nparameters of the supersymmetric standard model are induced by the gauge\ninteractions of some messenger fields. The parameters exhibit flavor\nuniversality which is dictated by the gauge interactions and which efficiently\neliminates new dangerous contributions to flavor changing neutral currents.\nHowever, the Higgs potential in this framework typically contains an\nunacceptable hierarchy between its dimensionful parameters (the $\\mu$-problem\nof gauge mediation). We show that the problem can be resolved if the Higgs\npotential arises dynamically once an intermediate U(1)' sector is integrated\nout rather than arising radiatively from some Yukawa interactions at the\nmessenger scale. As an added benefit, such models may naturally avoid new\ncontribution to CP violating amplitudes. The proposed framework is described,\nexplicit examples are given and its phenomenology is explored. The $\\mu$\nproblem is resolved in this case by the low-energy U(1)' dynamics which could\nbe tested in future collider experiments.\n", "  The phase structures of Nambu-Jona-Lasinio models with one or two flavours\nhave been investigated at non-zero values of $\\mu$ and $H$, where $H$ is an\nexternal magnetic field and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential. In the phase\nportraits of both models there arise infinitely many massless chirally\nsymmetric phases, as well as massive ones with spontaneously broken chiral\ninvariance, reflecting the existence of infinitely many Landau levels. Phase\ntransitions of first and second orders and a lot of tricritical points have\nbeen shown to exist in phase diagrams. In the massless case, such a phase\nstructure leads unavoidably to the standard van Alphen-de Haas magnetic\noscillations of some thermodynamical quantities, including magnetization,\npressure and particle density. In the massive case we have found an oscillating\nbehaviour not only for thermodynamical quantities, but also for a dynamical\nquantity as the quark mass. Besides, in this case we have non-standard, i.e.\nnon-periodic, magnetic oscillations, since the frequency of oscillations is an\n$H$-dependent quantity.\n", "  The B -> K^* gamma branching fraction is predicted using heavy quark spin\nsymmetry at large recoil to relate the tensor and (axial-)vector form factors,\nusing heavy quark flavor symmetry to relate the B decay form factors to the\nmeasured D -> K^* l nu form form factors, and extrapolating the semileptonic B\ndecay form factors to large recoil assuming nearest pole dominance. This\nprediction agrees with data surprisingly well, and we comment on its\nimplications for the extraction of |Vub| from B -> rho l nu.\n", "  The QCD-based operator-product-expansion technique is systematically applied\nto the study of charmed meson lifetimes. We stress that it is crucial to take\ninto account the momentum of the spectator light quark of charmed mesons,\notherwise the destructive Pauli-interference effect in $D^+$ decays will lead\nto a negative decay width for the $D^+$. We have applied the QCD sum rule\napproach to estimate the hadronic matrix elements of color-singlet and\ncolor-octet 4-quark operators relevant to nonleptonic inclusive $D$ decays. The\nlifetime of $D_s^+$ is found to be longer than that of $D^0$ because the latter\nreceives a constructive $W$-exchange contribution, whereas the hadronic\nannihilation and leptonic contributions to the former are compensated by the\nPauli interference. We obtain the lifetime ratio $\\tau(D_s^+)/\\tau(D^0)$\n$\\approx 1.08\\pm 0.04$, which is larger than some earlier theoretical\nestimates, but still smaller than the recent measurements by CLEO and E791.\n", "  Observed decay rates indicate large phase differences among the amplitudes\nfor the charge states in $D \\to \\bar K \\pi$ and $D \\to \\bar K^* \\pi$ but\nrelatively real amplitudes in the charge states for $D \\to \\bar K \\rho$. This\nfeature is traced using an SU(3) flavor analysis to a sign flip in the\ncontribution of one of the amplitudes contributing to the latter processes in\ncomparison with its contribution to the other two sets. This amplitude may be\nregarded as an effect of rescattering and is found to be of magnitude\ncomparable to others contributing to charmed particle two-body nonleptonic\ndecays.\n", "  We investigate, in detail, a model in which the third family fermions are\nsubjected to an SU(2) dynamics different from the first two families.\nConstrained by the precision Z-pole data, the heavy gauge boson mass is bounded\nfrom below to be about 1.7 TeV at the $2\\sigma$ level. The flavor-changing\nneutral current (FCNC) in the lepton sector can be significant in\n$\\tau\\leftrightarrow e$ and $\\tau \\leftrightarrow \\mu$ transitions. In the\nlatter case, the ratio $Br(\\tau\\to \\mu \\bar{\\nu_\\mu} \\nu_\\tau)/ Br(\\tau\\to e\n\\bar{\\nu_e} \\nu_\\tau)$ and $Br(\\tau\\to \\mu \\mu \\mu)$ can constrain the model\nbetter than LEP/SLC data in some region of the parameter space. Furthermore,\nFCNCs are unavoidable in the quark sector. Significant effects to the\n$B^0-\\bar{B^0}$ mixing and the rare decays of the K and B mesons, such as\n$K^\\pm \\to \\pi^\\pm \\nu {\\bar \\nu}$, $b \\to s \\nu {\\bar \\nu}, B_s \\to\n\\tau^+\\tau^-, \\mu^+\\mu^-$ and $B_{s,d} \\to \\mu^\\pm \\tau^\\mp$, are expected.\n", "  We discuss the effect of the external fermion masses in the flavor-changing\nradiative transitions of a heavy fermion (quark or lepton) to a lighter fermion\nat the one-loop level, and point out an often overlooked crucial difference in\nthe sign of a charge factor between transitions of the down type $s\\to d\\gamma$\nand the up type $c\\to u\\gamma$. We give formulas for the $F\\to f\\gamma$\neffective vertex in various approximations and the exact formula for $t\\to\nc\\gamma$ and $\\tau \\to \\mu \\gamma$.\n", "  We present a one-loop calculation of the static potential in the SU(2)-Higgs\nmodel. The connection to the coupling constant definition used in lattice\nsimulations is clarified. The consequences in comparing lattice simulations and\nperturbative results for finite temperature applications are explored.\n", "  Corrections of $O(\\alpha_s^2)$ to the decay of the top quark into a W boson\nand a bottom quark are calculated. The method is based on an expansion of the\ntop quark propagator for small external momentum, q, as compared to the top\nquark mass, M_t. The physical point q^2 = M_t^2 is reached through Pad\\'e\napproximations. The described method allows to take effects induced by a finite\nW boson mass into account. The numerical relevance of the result is discussed.\nImportant cross-checks against recent results for the decay rate $b \\to u l\n\\bar\\nu$ and the two-loop QED corrections to $\\mu$-decay are performed.\n", "  We introduce a new confining force (\\mu-color) at TeV scale to dynamically\ngenerate a supersymmetry preserving mass scale which would replace the \\mu\nparameter in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). We discuss the\nHiggs phenomenology and also the pattern of soft supersymmetry breaking\nparameters allowing the correct electroweak symmetry breaking within the\n\\mu-color model, which have quite distinctive features from the MSSM and also\nfrom other generalizations of the MSSM.\n", "  We provide upper and lower bounds on the form factors for B -> D, D^* by\nutilizing inclusive heavy quark effective theory sum rules. These bounds are\ncalculated to leading order in Lambda_QCD/m_Q and alpha_s. The O(alpha_s^2\nbeta_0) corrections to the bounds at zero recoil are also presented. We compare\nour bounds with some of the form factor models used in the literature. All the\nmodels we investigated failed to fall within the bounds for the combination of\nform factors (omega^2 - 1)/(4 omega)|omega h_{A2}+h_{A3}|^2.\n", "  We consider laboratory experiments that can detect stable, neutral strongly\ninteracting massive particles (SIMPs). We explore the SIMP annihilation cross\nsection from its minimum value (restricted by cosmological bounds) to the barn\nrange, and vary the mass values from a GeV to a TeV. We calculate, as a\nfunction of the SIMP-nucleon cross section, the minimum nucleon number A for\nwhich there should be binding in a nucleus. We consider accelerator mass\nspectrometry with a gold (A=200) target, and compute the likely abundance of\nanomalous gold nuclei if stable neutral SIMPs exist. We also consider the\nprospects and problems of detecting such particles at the Tevatron. We estimate\noptimistically that such detection might be possible for SIMPs with\nSIMP-nucleon cross sections larger than 0.1 millibarn and masses between 25 and\n50 GeV.\n", "  We study color superconductivity in QCD at asymptotically large chemical\npotential. In this limit, pairing is dominated by perturbative one-gluon\nexchange. We derive the Eliashberg equation for the pairing gap and solve this\nequation numerically. Taking into account both magnetic and electric gluon\nexchanges, we find $\\Delta\\sim g^{-5}\\exp(-c/g)$ with $c=3\\pi^2/\\sqrt{2}$,\nverifying a recent result by Son. For chemical potentials that are of physical\ninterest, $\\mu< 1$ GeV, the calculation ceases to be reliable quantitatively,\nbut our results suggest that the gap can be as large as 100 MeV.\n", "  We consider the cosmology that results if our observable universe is a\n3-brane in a higher dimensional universe. In particular, we focus on the case\nwhere our 3-brane is located at the $Z_2$ symmetry fixed plane of a $Z_2$\nsymmetric five-dimensional spacetime, as in the Ho\\v{r}ava-Witten model\ncompactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold. As our first result, we find that there\ncan be substantial modifications to the standard Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\n(FRW) cosmology; as a consequence, a large class of such models is\nobservationally inconsistent. In particular, any relationship between the\nHubble constant and the energy density on our brane is possible, including (but\nnot only) FRW. Generically, due to the existence of the bulk and the boundary\nconditions on the orbifold fixed plane, the relationship is not FRW, and hence\ncosmological constraints coming from big bang nucleosynthesis, structure\nformation, and the age of the universe difficult to satisfy. We do wish to\npoint out, however, that some specific choices for the bulk stress-energy\ntensor components do reproduce normal FRW cosmology on our brane, and we have\nconstructed an explicit example. As our second result, for a broad class of\nmodels, we find a somewhat surprising fact: the stabilization of the radius of\nthe extra dimension and hence the four dimensional Planck mass requires\nunrealistic fine-tuning of the equation of state on our 3-brane. In the last\nthird of the paper, we make remarks about causality and the horizon problem\nthat apply to {\\it any} theory in which the volume of the extra dimension\ndetermines the four-dimensional gravitational coupling. We point out that some\nof the assumptions that lead to the usual inflationary requirements are\nmodified.\n", "  Determination of the top-quark Yukawa couplings in the process e+ e- -> t\n\\bar{t} Z has been studied for the high luminosity option (\\int L=500\\fbinver)\nof a linear e+e- collider. Polarization of the electron beam has been\nconsidered. The method of optimal observables has been adopted to determine the\ncouplings and to disentangle different models. It has been found that it could\nbe possible to discriminate between the Standard Model scalar Higgs boson, pure\npseudoscalar and the Higgs boson of mixed CP at about 12 \\sigma level for\n\\sqrt{s}=1.TeV for the Higgs boson close to the production threshold both for\nthe leptonic and hadronic top-quark decay channels. However, \\sqrt{s}=.5 TeV\ncollider turned out to have too small energy for tests of the top-quark Yukawa\ncoupling because of its limited production rate (at most 2.5 \\sigma effect).\nPossible tests of CP violation in the scalar sector have been considered.\n", "  Recently, Randall and Sundrum proposed a solution to the hierarchy problem\nwhere the background spacetime is five dimensional. There are two 3-branes, and\nthe mass scale for fields that propagate on one of the 3-branes is\nexponentially suppressed relative to the fundamental scale of theory, which is\ntaken to be the Planck mass, M_Pl. In this letter we show that bulk fields with\na five dimensional mass term of order M_Pl have, after integrating over the\nextra dimension, modes with four-dimensional masses that are exponentially\nsuppressed as well. This opens the possibility that in this scenario the\nStandard Model matter fields may correspond to degrees of freedom that are not\nconfined to a 3-brane.\n", "  We investigate the time evolution of a classical ensemble of isolated\nperiodic chains of O(N)-symmetric anharmonic oscillators. Our method is based\non an exact evolution equation for the time dependence of correlation\nfunctions. We discuss its solutions in an approximation which retains all\ncontributions in next-to-leading order in a 1/N expansion and preserves time\nreflection symmetry. We observe effective irreversibility and approximate\nthermalization. At large time the system approaches stationary solutions in the\nvicinity of, but not identical to, thermal equilibrium. The ensemble therefore\nretains some memory of the initial condition beyond the conserved total energy.\nSuch a behavior with incomplete thermalization is referred to as \"mesoscopic\ndynamics\". It is expected for systems in a small volume. Surprisingly, we find\nthat the nonthermal asymptotic stationary solutions do not change for large\nvolume. This raises questions on Boltzmann's conjecture that macroscopic\nisolated systems thermalize.\n", "  Upper and lower bounds are established on the Lambda_b -> Lambda_c\nsemileptonic decay form factors by utilizing inclusive\nheavy-quark-effective-theory sum rules. These bounds are calculated to leading\norder in Lambda_QCD/m_Q and alpha_s. The O(alpha_s^2 beta_0) corrections to the\nbounds at zero recoil are also presented. Several form factor models used in\nthe literature are compared with our bounds.\n", "  Theoretical description of the spin dependent structure function g_1(x,Q^2)\nin the region of low values of x and Q^2 is presented. It contains the Vector\nMeson Dominance contribution and the QCD improved parton model suitably\nextended to the low Q^2 domain. Theoretical predictions are compared with the\nrecent experimental data in the low x, low Q^2 region.\n", "  Changes of variables giving the dual model are constructed explicitly for\nsigma-models without isotropy. In particular, the jacobian is calculated to\ngive the known results. The global aspects of the abelian case as well as some\nof those of the cases where the isometry group is simply connected are\nconsidered.\n  Considering the anomalous case, we infer by a consistency argument that the\n`multiplicative anomaly' should be replaceable by adequate rules for\nfactorization of composite jacobians. These rules are then generalized in a\nsimple way for composite jacobians defined in spaces of different types.\nImplimentation of these rules then gives specific formulas for the anomally for\nsemisimple algebras and also for solvable ones.\n", "  The effective action of a SU(N)-gauge theory coupled to fermions is evaluated\nat a large infrared cut-off scale k within the path integral approach. The\ngauge field measure includes topologically non-trivial configurations\n(instantons). Due to the explicit infrared regularisation there are no gauge\nfield zero modes. The Dirac operator of instanton configurations shows a zero\nmode even after the infrared regularisation, which leads to U_A(1)-violating\nterms in the effective action. These terms are calculated in the limit of large\nscales k.\n", "  A new method is applied to solve the Baxter equation for three coupled,\nnoncompact spins. Due to the equivalence with the system of three reggeized\ngluons, the intercept of the odderon trajectory is predicted for the first\ntime, as the analytic function of the two relevant parameters.\n", "  We compute the gravitational coupling $F_1$ for IIA string theory on $K3\n\\times T^2$ and use string-string duality to deduce the corresponding term for\nheterotic string on $T^6$. The latter is an infinite sum of gravitational\ninstanton effects which we associate with the effects of Euclidean fivebranes\nwrapped on $T^6$. These fivebranes are the neutral fivebranes or zero size\ninstantons of heterotic string theory.\n", "  We consider the automorphic forms which govern the gravitational threshold\ncorrection $F_1$ in models of heterotic/IIA duality with N=2 supersymmetry in\nfour dimensions. In particular we derive the full nonperturbative formula for\n$F_1$ for the dual pair originally considered by Ferrara, Harvey, Strominger\nand Vafa (FHSV). The answer involves an interesting automorphic product\nconstructed by Borcherds which is associated to the ``fake Monster Lie\nsuperalgebra.'' As an application of this result we rederive a result of\nJorgenson & Todorov on determinants of $\\bar \\partial$ operators on $K3$\nsurfaces.\n", "  Formulating the statistical mechanics for a scalar field with non-minimal\n$\\xi R \\phi^2$ coupling in a black hole background we propose modification of\nthe original 't Hooft ``brick wall'' prescription. Instead of the Dirichlet\ncondition we suggest some scattering ansatz for the field functions at the\nhorizon. This modifies the energy spectrum of the system and allows one to\nobtain the statistical entropy dependent on the non-minimal coupling. For\n$\\xi<0$ the entropy renormalizes the classical Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in\nthe correct way and agrees with the result previously obtained within the\nconical singularity approach. For a positive $\\xi$, however, the results\ndiffer.\n", "  We calculate within an algebraic Bjorken-Johnson-Low (BJL) method anomalous\nSchwinger terms of fermionic currents and the Gauss law operator in chiral\ngauge theories. The current algebra is known to violate the Jacobi identity in\nan iterative computation. Our method takes the subtleties of the equal-time\nlimit into account and leads to an algebra that fulfills the Jacobi identity.\nThe non-iterative terms appearing in the double commutators can be traced back\ndirectly to the projective representation of the gauge group.\n", "  We study soliton solutions in 1+1 dimensional gauged sigma models, obtained\nby dimensional reduction from its 2+1 dimensional counterparts. We show that\nthe Bogomol'nyi bound of these models can be expressed in terms of two\nconserved charges in a similar way to that of the BPS dyons in 3+1 dimensions.\nPurely magnetic vortices of the 2+1 dimensional completely gauged sigma model\nappear as charged solitons in the corresponding 1+1 dimensional theory. The\nscale invariance of these solitons is also broken because of the dimensional\nreduction. We obtain exact static soliton solutions of these models saturating\nthe Bogomol'nyi bound.\n", "  A scaling hypothesis for the n-particle spectral densities of the O(3)\nnonlinear sigma-model is described. It states that for large particle numbers\nthe n-particle spectral densities are ``self-similar'' in being basically\nrescaled copies of a universal shape function. This can be viewed as a\n2-dimensional, but non-perturbative analogue of the KNO scaling in QCD.\nPromoted to a working hypothesis, it allows one to compute the two point\nfunctions at ``all'' energy or length scales. In addition, the values of two\nnon-perturbative constants (needed for a parameter-free matching of the\nperturbative and the non-perturbative regime) are determined exactly.\n", "  Expanding upon earlier work of Pouliot and Strassler, we construct chiral\nmagnetic duals to nonchiral supersymmetric electric theories based upon SO(7),\nSO(8) and SO(9) gauge groups with various numbers of vector and spinor matter\nsuperfields. Anomalies are matched and gauge invariant operators are mapped\nwithin each dual pair. Renormalization group flows along flat directions are\nalso examined. We find that confining phase quantum constraints in the electric\ntheories are recovered from semiclassical equations of motion in their magnetic\ncounterparts when the dual gauge groups are completely Higgsed.\n", "  Motivated by the recent D-brane constructions of world-volume monopoles and\ninstantons, we study the supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills theory on $S^1 \\times\nR^{3+1}$, spontaneously broken by a Wilson loop. In addition to the usual N-1\nfundamental monopoles, the N-th BPS monopole appears from the Kaluza-Klein\nsector. When all N monopoles are present, net magnetic charge vanishes and the\nsolution can be reinterpreted as a Wilson-loop instanton of unit Pontryagin\nnumber. The instanton/multi-monopole moduli space is explicitly constructed,\nand seen to be identical to a Coulomb phase moduli space of a U(1)^N gauge\ntheory in 2+1 dimensions related to Kronheimer's gauge theory of SU(N) type.\nThis extends the results by Intriligator and Seiberg to the finite couplings\nthat, in the infrared limit of Kronheimer's theory, the Coulomb phase\nparameterizes a centered SU(N) instanton. We also elaborate on the case of\nrestored SU(N) symmetry.\n", "  An expression for the spacetime absorption coefficient of a scalar field in a\nfive dimensional, near extremal black hole background is derived, which has the\nsame form as that presented by Maldacena and Strominger, but is valid over a\nlarger, U-duality invariant region of parameter space and in general disagrees\nwith the corresponding D-brane result. We develop an argument, based on D-brane\nthermodynamics, which specifies the range of parameters over which agreement\nshould be expected. For neutral emission, the spacetime and D-brane results\nagree over this range. However, for charged emission, we find disagreement in\nthe `Fat Black Hole' regime, in which charge is quantized in smaller units on\nthe brane, than in the bulk of spacetime. We indicate a possible problem with\nthe D-brane model in this regime. We also use the Born approximation to study\nthe high frequency limit of the absorption coefficient and find that it\napproaches unity, for large black hole backgrounds, at frequencies still below\nthe string scale, again in disagreement with D-brane results.\n", "  A low-energy background field solution is presented which describes several\nD-membranes oriented at angles with respect to one another. The mass and charge\ndensities for this configuration are computed and found to saturate the BPS\nbound, implying the preservation of one-quarter of the supersymmetries.\nT-duality is exploited to construct new solutions with nontrivial angles from\nthe basic one.\n", "  We generalize a family of Lagrangians with values in the Poincar\\'e group\nISO(d-1,1), which contain the description of spinning strings in flat (d-1)+1\ndimensions, by including symmetric terms in the world-sheet coordinates. Then,\nby promoting a subgroup H=R^n, n less than or equal to d, which acts\ninvariantly from the left on the element of ISO(d-1,1), to a gauge symmetry of\nthe action, we obtain a family of sigma-models. They describe bosonic strings\nmoving in (generally) curved, and in some cases degenerate, space-times with an\naxion field. Further, the space-times of the effective theory admit in general\nT-dual geometries. We give explicit results for two non degenerate cases.\n", "  On the basis of Borel resummation, we propose a systematical improvement of\nbounce calculus of quantum bubble nucleation rate. We study a metastable\nsuper-renormalizable field theory, $D$ dimensional O(N) symmetric $\\phi^4$\nmodel ($D<4$) with an attractive interaction. The validity of our proposal is\ntested in D=1 (quantum mechanics) by using the perturbation series of ground\nstate energy to high orders. We also present a result in D=2, based on an\nexplicit calculation of vacuum bubble diagrams to five loop orders.\n", "  QCD is constructed as a lattice gauge theory in which the elements of the\nlink matrices are represented by non-commuting operators acting in a Hilbert\nspace. The resulting quantum link model for QCD is formulated with a fifth\nEuclidean dimension, whose extent resembles the inverse gauge coupling of the\nresulting four-dimensional theory after dimensional reduction. The inclusion of\nquarks is natural in Shamir's variant of Kaplan's fermion method, which does\nnot require fine-tuning to approach the chiral limit. A rishon representation\nin terms of fermionic constituents of the gluons is derived and the quantum\nlink Hamiltonian for QCD with a U(N) gauge symmetry is expressed in terms of\nglueball, meson and constituent quark operators. The new formulation of QCD is\npromising both from an analytic and from a computational point of view.\n", "  We construct a system of bosonic closed string field theory coupled to a\nD-brane. The interaction between the D-brane and closed string field is\nintroduced using the boundary state which is a function of constant field\nstrength $F_{\\mu\\nu}$ and the tilt $\\theta_\\mu^i$ of the D-brane. We find that\nthe gauge invariance requirement on the system determines the\n$(F_{\\mu\\nu},\\theta_\\mu^i)$-dependence of the normalization factor of the\nboundary state as well as the form of the purely $(F_{\\mu\\nu},\\theta_\\mu^i)$\nterm of the action. Correspondence between the action in the present formalism\nand the low energy effective action (bulk + D-brane actions) in the\n$\\sigma$-model approach is studied.\n", "  We construct the most general supersymmetric configuration of D2-branes and\nD6-branes on a 6-torus. It contains arbitrary numbers of branes at relative\nU(3) angles. The corresponding supergravity solutions are constructed and\nexpressed in a remarkably simple form, using the complex geometry of the\ncompact space. The spacetime supersymmetry of the configuration is verified\nexplicitly, by solution of the Killing spinor equations. Our configurations can\nbe interpreted as a 16-parameter family of regular extremal black holes in four\ndimensions. Their entropy is interpreted microscopically by counting the\ndegeneracy of bound states of D-branes. Our result agrees in detail with the\nprediction for the degeneracy of BPS states in terms of the quartic invariant\nof the E(7,7) duality group.\n", "  We examine the supersymmetry of classical D-brane and M-brane configurations\nand explain the dependence of Killing spinors on coordinates. We find that one\nhalf supersymmetry is broken in the bulk and that supersymmetry near the\nD-brane horizon is restored for $p\\leq 3$, for solutions in the stringy frame,\nbut only for $p=3$ in the10d canonical frame. We study the enhancement for the\ncase of four intersecting D-3-branes in 10 dimensions and the implication of\nthis for the size of the infinite throat of the near horizon geometry in\nnon-compactified theory. We found some indications of universality of near\nhorizon geometries of various intersecting brane configurations.\n", "  The semi-classical cross-sections for arbitrary partial waves of ordinary\nscalars to fall into certain five-dimensional black holes have a form that\nseems capable of explanation in terms of the effective string model. The\nkinematics of these processes is analyzed in detail on the effective string and\nis shown to reproduce the correct functional form of the semi-classical\ncross-sections. But it is necessary to choose a peculiar value of the effective\nstring tension to obtain the correct scaling properties. Furthermore, the\nassumptions of locality and statistics combine to forbid the effective string\nfrom absorbing more than a finite number of partial waves. The relation of this\nlimitation to cosmic censorship is discussed.\n", "  The recently proposed ``correspondence principle'' of Horowitz and Polchinski\nprovides a concrete means to relate (among others) black holes with electric\nNS-NS charges to fundamental strings and correctly match their entropies. We\ntest further this correspondence by examining the greybody factors in the\nabsorption rates of neutral, minimally coupled scalars by a near extremal black\nhole. Perhaps surprisingly, the results disagree in general with the absorption\nby weakly coupled strings. Though this does not disprove the correspondence, it\nindicates that it might not be simple in this region of the black hole\nparameter space.\n", "  Decay of a near-extremal black hole down to the extremal state is studied in\nthe background field approximation to determine the fate of injected matter and\nHawking pairs. By examining the behavior of light rays and solutions to the\nwave equation it is concluded that the singularity at the origin is irrelevant.\nFurthermore, there is most likely an instability of the event horizon arising\nfrom the accumulation of injected matter and Hawking partners there. The\npossible role of this instability in reconciling the D-brane and black hole\npictures of the decay process is discussed.\n", "  The pre-big-bang cosmology inspired by superstring theories has been\nsuggested as an alternative to slow-roll inflation. We analyze, in both the\nJordan and Einstein frames, the effect of spatial curvature on this scenario\nand show that too much curvature --- of either sign --- reduces the duration of\nthe inflationary era to such an extent that the flatness and horizon problems\nare not solved. Hence, a fine-tuning of initial conditions is required to\nobtain enough inflation to solve the cosmological problems.\n", "  A black hole solution to low energy type IIA string theory which is extremal,\nnon-supersymmetric, and carries 0- and 6-brane charge is presented. For large\nvalues of the charges it is metastable and a corresponding D-brane picture can\nbe found. The mass and statistical entropy of the two descriptions agree at a\ncorrespondence point up to factors of order one, providing more evidence that\nthe correspondence principle for black holes and strings of Horowitz and\nPolchinski may be extended to include black holes with more than one\nRamond-Ramond charge.\n", "  We have found that kappa-symmetry allows a covariant quantization provided\nthe ground state of the theory is strictly massive. For D-p-branes a\nHamiltonian analysis is performed to explain the existence of a manifestly\nsupersymmetric and Lorentz covariant description of the BPS states of the\ntheory. The covariant quantization of the D-0-brane is presented as an example.\n", "  The horizon area and curvature of three-charge BPS black strings are studied\nin the D-brane ensemble for the stationary black string. The charge\ndistributions along the string are used to translate the classical expressions\nfor the horizon area and curvature of BPS black strings with waves into\noperators on the D-brane Hilbert space. Despite the fact that any `wavy' black\nstring has smaller horizon area and divergent curvature, the typical values of\nthe horizon area and effects of the horizon curvature in the D-brane ensemble\ndeviate negligibly from those of the original stationary black string in the\nlimit of large integer charges. Whether this holds in general will depend on\ncertain properties of the quantum bound states.\n", "  A low-energy background field solution describing D-membrane configurations\nis constructed which is distinguished by the appearance of a Hermitian metric\non the internal space. This metric is composed of a number of independent\nharmonic functions on the transverse space. Thus this construction generalizes\nthe usual harmonic superposition rule. The BPS bound of these solutions is\nshown to be saturated indicating that they are supersymmetric. By means of\nT-duality, we construct more solutions of the IIA and IIB theories.\n", "  We study the force balance between orthogonally positioned $p$-brane and\n$(8-p)$-brane. The force due to graviton and dilaton exchange is repulsive in\nthis case. We identify the attractive force that balances this repulsion as due\nto one-half of a fundamental string stretched between the branes. As the\n$p$-brane passes through the $(8-p)$-brane, the connecting string changes\ndirection, which may be interpreted as creation of one fundamental string. We\nshow this directly from the structure of the Chern-Simons terms in the D-brane\neffective actions. We also discuss the effect of string creation on the 0-brane\nquantum mechanics in the type I' theory. The creation of a fundamental string\nis related by U-duality to the creation of a 3-brane discussed by Hanany and\nWitten. Both processes have a common origin in M-theory: as two M5-branes with\none common direction cross, a M2-brane stretched between them is created.\n", "  We consider eight-brane configurations in M(atrix) theory and compute their\ninteraction potentials with gravitons, membranes, and four-branes. We compare\nthese results with the interactions of D8-branes with D0-branes, D2-branes, and\nD4-branes in IIA string theory. We find agreement between the two approaches\nfor eight-brane interactions with two-branes and four-branes. A discrepancy is\nnoted in the case with zero-branes.\n", "  We consider M(atrix) theory compactifications to seven dimensions with eight\nunbroken supersymmetries. We conjecture that both M(atrix) theory on K3 and\nHeterotic M(atrix) theory on T^3 are described by the same 5+1 dimensional\ntheory with N=2 supersymmetry which is broken to N=1 by the base space. The\nemergence of the extra dimension follows from a recent result of\nRozali[hep-th/9702136]. We show that the seven dimensional duality between\nM-theory on K3 and Heterotic string theory on T^3 is realised in M(atrix)\ntheory as the exchange of one of the dimensions with this new dimension.\n", "  We discuss issues involving p(D)- brane charge quantization and the\nnormalization of effective actions, in string/M-theory. We also construct the\naction of (the bosonic sector of) eleven dimensional supergravity in the\npresence of two- and five- branes and discuss (perturbative) anomaly\ncancellation.\n", "  An action for a string and a particle with two timelike dimensions is\nproposed and analyzed. Due to new gauge symmetries and associated constraints,\nthe motion of each system in the background of the other is equivalent to\neffective motion with a single timelike dimension. The quantum constraints are\nconsistent only in critical dimensions. For the bosonic system in flat\nspacetime the critical dimension is 27 or 28, with signature (25,2) or (26,2),\ndepending on whether the particle is massive or massless respectively. For the\nsupersymmetric case the critical dimensions are 11 or 12, with signature (9,2)\nor (10,2), under the same circumstances. Generalizations to multiparticles,\nstrings and p-branes are outlined.\n", "  Variational (Rayleigh-Ritz) methods are applied to local quantum field\ntheory. For scalar theories the wave functional is parametrized in the form of\na superposition of Gaussians and the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is\nexpressed in a form that can be minimized numerically. A scheme of successive\nrefinements of the superposition is proposed that may converge to the exact\nfunctional. As an illustration, a simple numerical approximation for the\neffective potential is worked out based on minimization with respect to five\nvariational parameters. A variational principle is formulated for the fermion\nvacuum energy as a functional of the scalar fields to which the fermions are\ncoupled. The discussion in this paper is given for scalar and fermion\ninteractions in 1+1 dimensions. The extension to higher dimensions encounters a\nmore involved structure of ultraviolet divergences and is deferred to future\nwork.\n", "  We calculate the number spectrum of particles radiated during a scattering\ninto a heat bath using the thermal largest-time equation and the\nDyson-Schwinger equation. We show how one can systematically calculate\n{d<N(\\omega)>}/{d\\omega} to any order using modified real time\nfinite-temperature diagrams. Our approach is demonstrated on a simple model\nwhere two scalar particles scatter, within a photon-electron heat bath, into a\npair of charged particles and it is shown how to calculate the resulting\nchanges in the number spectra of the photons and electrons.\n", "  We discuss supersymmetric quantum mechanical models with periodic potentials.\nThe important new feature is that it is possible for both isospectral\npotentials to support zero modes, in contrast to the standard nonperiodic case\nwhere either one or neither (but not both) of the isospectral pair has a zero\nmode. Thus it is possible to have supersymmetry unbroken and yet also have a\nvanishing Witten index. We present some explicit exactly soluble examples for\nwhich the isospectral potentials have identical band spectra, and which are\n``self-isospectral'' in the sense that the potentials have identical shape, but\nare translated by one half period relative to one another.\n", "  We study the one-loop corrections to the effective on-shell action of N=2\nsupergravity in the background of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. In the\nextreme case the contributions from graviton, gravitino and photon to the\none-loop corrections to the entropy are shown to cancel. This gives the first\nexplicit example of the supersymmetric non-renormalization theorem for the\non-shell action (entropy) for BPS configurations which admit Killing spinors.\nWe display the residual supersymmetry of the perturbations of a general\nsupersymmetric theory in a bosonic BPS background.\n", "  Sigma models describing low energy effective actions on D0-brane probes with\nN=8 supercharges are studied in detail using a manifestly d=1, N=4 super-space\nformalism. Two 0+1 dimensional N=4 multiplets together with their general\nactions are constructed. We derive the condition for these actions to be N=8\nsupersymmetric and apply these techniques to various D-brane configurations. We\nfind that if in addition to N=8 supersymmetry the action must also have Spin(5)\ninvariance, the form of the sigma model metric is uniquely determined by the\none-loop result and is not renormalized perturbatively or non-perturbatively.\n", "  I attempt to analyse the next-to-leading-order non-holomorphic contribution\nto the Wilsonian low-energy effective action in the four-dimensional N=2 gauge\ntheories with matter, from the manifestly N=2 supersymmeric point of view, by\nusing the harmonic superspace. The perturbative one-loop correction is found to\nbe in agreement with the N=1 superfield calculations of de Wit, Grisaru and\nRocek. The previously unknown coefficient in front of this non-holomorphic\ncorrection is calculated. A special attention is devoted to the N=2\nsuperconformal gauge theories, whose one-loop non-holomorphic contribution is\nlikely to be exact, even non-perturbatively. This leading (one-loop)\nnon-holomorphic contribution to the LEEA of the N=2 superconformally invariant\ngauge field theories is calculated, and it does not vanish, similarly to the\ncase of the N=4 super-Yang-Mills theory.\n", "  We show that the growth of the size with the number of partons holds in a\nThomas-Fermi analysis of the threshold bound state of D0--branes. Our results\nsharpen the evidence that for a fixed value of the eleven dimensional radius\nthe partonic velocities can be made arbitrarily small as one approaches the\nlarge N limit.\n", "  In this paper we first investigate the Ansatz of one of the present authors\nfor K(\\Psi,\\bar\\Psi), the adimensional modular invariant non-holomorphic\ncorrection to the Wilsonian effective Lagrangian of an N=2 globally\nsupersymmetric gauge theory. The renormalisation group beta-function of the\ntheory crucially allows us to express K(\\Psi,\\bar\\Psi) in a form that easily\ngeneralises to the case in which the theory is coupled to N_F hypermultiplets\nin the fundamental representation of the gauge group. This function satisfies\nan equation which should be viewed as a fully non-perturbative ``non-chiral\nsuperconformal Ward identity\". We also determine its renormalisation group\nequation. Furthermore, as a first step towards checking the validity of this\nAnsatz, we compute the contribution to K(\\Psi,\\bar\\Psi) from instantons of\nwinding number k=1 and k=2. As a by-product of our analysis we check a\nnon-renormalisation theorem for N_F=4.\n", "  We propose a new formulation of chiral fermions on a lattice, on the basis of\na lattice extension of the covariant regularization scheme in continuum field\ntheory. The species doublers do not emerge. The real part of the effective\naction is just one half of that of Dirac-Wilson fermion and is always gauge\ninvariant even with a finite lattice spacing. The gauge invariance of the\nimaginary part, on the other hand, sets a severe constraint which is a lattice\nanalogue of the gauge anomaly free condition. For real gauge representations,\nthe imaginary part identically vanishes and the gauge invariance becomes exact.\n", "  Type-IIB supersymmetric theories have an SL(2,Z) invariance, known as\nU-duality, which controls the non-perturbative behavior of the theory. Under\nSL(2,Z) the supercharges are doublets, implying that the bosonic charges would\nbe singlets or triplets. However, among the bosonic charges there are doublet\nstrings and doublet fivebranes which are in conflict with the doublet property\nof the supercharges. It is shown that the conflict is resolved by structure\nconstants that depend on moduli, such as the tau parameter, which transform\nunder the same SL(2,Z). The resulting superalgebra encodes the non-perturbative\nduality properties of the theory and is valid for any value of the string\ncoupling constant. The usefulness of the formalism is illustrated by applying\nit to purely algebraic computations of the tension of (p,q) strings, and the\nmass and entropy of extremal blackholes constructed from D-1-branes and\nD-5-branes. In the latter case the non-perturbative coupling dependence of the\nBPS mass and metric is computed for the first time in this paper. It is further\nargued that the moduli dependence of the superalgebra provides hints for four\nmore dimensions beyond ten, such that the superalgebra is embedded in a\nfundamental theory which would be covariant under SO(11,3). An outline is given\nfor a matrix theory in 14 dimensions that would be consistent with M(atrix)\ntheory as well as with the above observations.\n", "  Weyl Anomaly in the dilaton-scalar system in 2 dimensional gravity is\nexamined. We take the heat-kernel regularization for the ultraviolet\ndivergences. Generally the Weyl anomaly is determined by the 2nd order\ndifferential (elliptic) operator of the system and the definition of the\nmeasure. We have the freedom of the operator choice caused by the arbitrariness\nof total divergences (surface terms) in the action. We examine the Weyl anomaly\nin connection with such points and the hermiticity of the operator.\n", "  We develop a systematic method of the perturbative expansion around the\nGaussian effective action based on the background field method. We show, by\napplying the method to the quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator problem,\nthat even the first non-trivial correction terms greatly improve the Gaussian\napproximation.\n", "  We develop possible versions of supersymmetric single particle quantum\nmechanics, with application to superstring-bit models in view. We focus\nprincipally on space dimensions $d=1,2,4,8$, the transverse dimensionalities of\nsuperstring in $3,4,6,10$ space-time dimensions. These are the cases for which\n``classical'' superstring makes sense, and also the values of $d$ for which\nHooke's force law is compatible with the simplest superparticle dynamics. The\nbasic question we address is: When is it possible to replace such harmonic\nforce laws with more general ones, including forces which vanish at large\ndistances? This is an important question because forces between string-bits\nthat do not fall off with distance will almost certainly destroy cluster\ndecomposition. We show that the answer is affirmative for $d=1,2$, negative for\n$d=8$, and so far inconclusive for $d=4$.\n", "  We have constructed the N=1/2 supersymmetric general Abelian model with\nasymmetric chiral couplings. This leads to a N=1/2 supersymmetrization of the\nSchwinger model. We show that the supersymmetric general model is plagued with\nproblems of infrared divergence. Only the supersymmetric chiral Schwinger model\nis free from such problems and is dynamically equivalent to the chiral\nSchwinger model because of the peculiar structure of the N=1/2 multiplets.\n", "  We analyze the low energy behavior of N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories with\nSU(N_c) x SU(N_c) gauge group and a Landau-Ginzburg type superpotential. These\ntheories contain fundamentals transforming under one of the gauge groups as\nwell as bifundamental matter which transforms as a fundamentals under each. We\nobtain the parametrization of the gauge coupling on the Coulomb branch in terms\nof a hyperelliptic curve. The derivation of this curve involves making use of\nSeiberg's duality for SQCD as well as the classical constraints for N_f=N_c+1\nand the quantum modified constraints for N_f=N_c.\n", "  We consider configurations of D6-branes with D0-brane charge given by recent\nwork of Taylor and compute interaction potentials with various D-brane probes\nusing a 1-loop open string calculation. These results are compared to a\nsupergravity calculation using the solution given by Sheinblatt of an extremal\nblack hole carrying 0-brane and 6-brane charge.\n", "  Additional evidence is presented for a recently proposed effective string\nmodel, conjectured to hold throughout the parameter space of the basic 5\ndimensional, triply charged black holes, which includes the effects of brane\nexcitations, as well as momentum modes. We compute the low energy spacetime\nabsorption coefficient $\\sigma$ for the scattering of a triply-charged scalar\nfield in the near extremal case, and conjecture an exact form for $\\sigma$. It\nis shown that this form of $\\sigma$ arises simply from the effective string\nmodel. This agreement encompasses both statistical factors coming from the Bose\ndistributions of string excitations and a prefactor which depends on the\neffective string radius. An interesting feature of the effective string model\nis that the change in mass of the effective string system in an emission\nprocess is not equal to the change in the energies of the effective string\nexcitations. If the model is valid, this may hold clues towards understanding\nback reaction due to Hawking radiation. A number of weak spots and open\nquestions regarding the model are also noted.\n", "  We construct superstring theories that obey the new supersymmetry algebra\n{Q_a , Q_b}=\\gamma_{ab}^{mn} P_{1m} P_{2n}, in a Green-Schwarz formalism, with\nkappa supersymmetry also of the new type. The superstring is in a system with a\nsuperparticle so that their total momenta are $P_{2n},P_{1m}$ respectively. The\nsystem is covariant and critical in (10,2) dimensions if the particle is\nmassless and in (9,2) dimensions if the particle is massive. Both the\nsuperstring and superparticle have coordinates with two timelike dimensions but\neach behaves effectively as if they have a single timelike dimension. This is\ndue to gauge symmetries and associated constraints. We show how to generalize\nthe gauge principle to more intricate systems containing two parts, 1 and 2.\nEach part contains interacting constituents, such as p-branes, and each part\nbehaves effectively as if they have one timelike coordinate, although the full\nsystem has two timelike coordinates. The examples of two superparticles, and of\na superparticle and a superstring, discussed in more detail are a special cases\nof such a generalized interacting system.\n", "  We consider the realization of four-dimensional theories with N = 2\nsupersymmetry as M-theory configurations including a five-brane. Our emphasis\nis on the spectrum of massive states, that are realized as two-branes ending on\nthe five-brane. We start with a determination of the supersymmetries that are\nleft unbroken by the background metric and five-brane. We then show how the\ncentral charge of the N = 2 algebra arises from the central charge associated\nwith the M-theory two-brane. This determines the condition for a two-brane\nconfiguration to be BPS-saturated in the four-dimensional sense. By imposing\ncertain conditions on the moduli, we can give concrete examples of such\ntwo-branes. This leads us to conjecture that vectormultiplet and hypermultiplet\nBPS-saturated states correspond to two-branes with the topology of a cylinder\nand a disc respectively. We also discuss the phenomenon of marginal stability\nof BPS-saturated states.\n", "  Functional measures for lattice quantum gravity should agree with their\ncontinuum counterparts in the weak field, low momentum limit. After showing\nthat the standard simplicial measure satisfies the above requirement, we prove\nthat a class of recently proposed non-local measures for lattice gravity do not\nsatisfy such a criterion, already to lowest order in the weak field expansion.\nWe argue therefore that the latter cannot represent acceptable discrete\nfunctional measures for simplicial geometries.\n", "  In a wide class of supersymmetric theories degenerate families of the\nBPS-saturated domain walls exist. The internal structure of these walls can\ncontinuously vary, without changing the wall tension. This is described by\nhidden parameters (collective coordinates). Differentiating with respect to the\ncollective coordinates one gets a set of the bosonic zero modes localized on\nthe wall. Neither of them is related to the spontaneous breaking of any\nsymmetry. Through the residual 1/2 of supersymmetry each bosonic zero mode\ngenerates a fermionic partner.\n", "  The moduli space metric for an arbitrary number of extremal black holes in\nfour dimensions with arbitrary relatively supersymmetric charges is found.\n", "  We discuss the role of fixed scalars($\\nu,\\lambda$) in scattering off a\nfive-dimensional balck hole. The issue is to explain the disagreement of the\ngreybody factor for $\\lambda$ between the semiclassical and effective string\ncalculations. In the effective string approach, this is related to the\noperators with dimension (3,1) and (1,3). On the semiclassical calculation,\nthis originates from a complicated mixing between $\\lambda$ and other fields.\nHence it may depend on the decoupling procedure. It is shown that $\\lambda$\ndepends on the gauge choices such as the harmonic, dilaton gauges, and the\nKrasnitz-Klebanov setting for $h_{\\mu\\nu}$. It turns out that $\\nu$ plays a\nrole of test field well, while the role of $\\lambda$ is obscure.\n", "  In an effort to understand the physical implications of the newly discovered\nnon-trivial directions in scalar field theory, we compute lowest order\nscattering amplitudes, cross sections, and the 1-loop effective potential. To\nlowest order, the primary effect of the nonpolynomial nature of the theories is\na renormalization of the field. The high energy scaling of the 2-->2 cross\nsection is studied and found to differ significantly from that of pure phi^4\ntheory. From the 1-loop effective potential we determine that in some cases\nradiative corrections destroy classical symmetry breaking, resulting in a phase\nboundary between symmetry broken and unbroken theories. No radiatively induced\nsymmetry breaking is observed.\n", "  We investigate the geometric interpretation of the Standard Model based on\nnoncommutative geometry. Neglecting the $S_0$-reality symmetry one may\nintroduce leptoquarks into the model. We give a detailed discussion of the\nconsequences (both for the Connes-Lott and the spectral action) and compare the\nresults with physical bounds. Our result is that in either case one contradicts\nthe experimental results.\n", "  Starting from Nahm's equations, we explore BPS magnetic monopoles in the\nYang-Mills Higgs theory of gauge group $Sp(4)$ which is broken to $SU(2)\\times\nU(1)$. A family of BPS field configurations with purely Abelian magnetic charge\ndescribe two identical massive monopoles and one massless monopole. We\nconstruct the field configurations with axial symmetry by employing the ADHMN\nconstruction, and find the explicit expression of the metrics for the\n12-dimensional moduli space of Nahm data and its submanifolds.\n", "  We study the Hawking process on lattices falling into static black holes. The\nmotivation is to understand how the outgoing modes and Hawking radiation can\narise in a setting with a strict short distance cutoff in the free-fall frame.\nWe employ two-dimensional free scalar field theory. For a falling lattice with\na discrete time-translation symmetry we use analytical methods to establish\nthat, for Killing frequency $\\omega$ and surface gravity $\\kappa$ satisfying\n$\\kappa\\ll\\omega^{1/3}\\ll 1$ in lattice units, the continuum Hawking spectrum\nis recovered. The low frequency outgoing modes arise from exotic ingoing modes\nwith large proper wavevectors that \"refract\" off the horizon. In this model\nwith time translation symmetry the proper lattice spacing goes to zero at\nspatial infinity. We also consider instead falling lattices whose proper\nlattice spacing is constant at infinity and therefore grows with time at any\nfinite radius. This violation of time translation symmetry is visible only at\nwavelengths comparable to the lattice spacing, and it is responsible for\ntransmuting ingoing high Killing frequency modes into low frequency outgoing\nmodes.\n", "  We calculate instanton corrections to three dimensional gauge theories with\nN=4 and N=8 supersymmetry and SU(n) gauge groups. The N=4 results give new\ninformation about the moduli space of n BPS SU(2) monopoles, including the\nleading order non-pairwise interaction terms. A few comments are made on the\nrelationship of the N=8 results to membrane scattering in matrix theory.\n", "  A set of physical operators which are responsible for touching interactions\nin the framework of c<1 unitary conformal matter coupled to 2D quantum gravity\nis found. As a special case the non-critical bosonic strings are considered.\nSome analogies with four dimensional quantum gravity are also discussed, e.g.\ncreation-annihilation operators for baby universes, Coleman mechanism for the\ncosmological constant.\n", "  Recently several workers have attempted determinations of the so-called\nmagnetic mass of d=3 non-Abelian gauge theories through a one-loop gap\nequation, using a free massive propagator as input. Self-consistency is\nattained only on-shell, because the usual Feynman-graph construction is\ngauge-dependent off-shell. We examine two previous studies of the pinch\ntechnique proper self-energy, which is gauge-invariant at all momenta, using a\nfree propagator as input, and show that it leads to inconsistent and unphysical\nresult. In one case the residue of the pole has the wrong sign (necessarily\nimplying the presence of a tachyonic pole); in the second case the residue is\npositive, but two orders of magnitude larger than the input residue, which\nshows that the residue is on the verge of becoming ghostlike. This happens\nbecause of the infrared instability of d=3 gauge theory. A possible alternative\none-loop determination via the effective action also fails. The lesson is that\ngap equations must be considered at least at two-loop level.\n", "  A Lorentz covariant quantization of membrane dynamics is defined, which also\nleaves unbroken the full three dimensional diffeomorphism invariance of the\nmembrane. Among the applications studied are the reduction to string theory,\nwhich may be understood in terms of the phase space and constraints, and the\ninterpretation of physical,zero-energy states. A matrix regularization is\ndefined as in the light cone gauged fixed theory but there are difficulties\nimplementing all the gauge symmetries. The problem involves the\nnon-area-preserving diffeomorphisms which are realized non-linearly in the\nclassical theory. In the quantum theory they do not seem to have a consistent\nimplementation for finite N. Finally, an approach to a genuinely background\nindependent formulation of matrix dynamics is briefly described.\n", "  An \"expanded\" description is introduced to examine the spinor-monopole\nidentification proposed by Strassler for four-dimensional $\\cal N$ = 1\nsupersymmetric Spin(10) gauge theories with matter in F vector and N spinor\nrepresentations. It is shown that a Z_2 monopole in the \"expanded\" theory is\nassociated with massive spinors of the Spin(10) theory. For N=2, two spinor\ncase, we confirm this identification by matching the transformation properties\nof the two theories under SU(2) flavor symmetry. However, for N $\\ge$ 3, the\ntransformation properties are not matched between the spinors and the monopole.\nThis disagreement might be due to the fact that the SU(N) flavor symmetry of\nthe Spin(10) theory is partially realized as an SU(2) symmetry in the\n\"expanded\" theory.\n", "  The recent suggestion that the entropy of Schwarzschild black holes can be\ncomputed in matrix theory using near-extremal D-brane thermodynamics is\nexamined. It is found that the regime in which this approach is valid actually\ndescribes black strings stretched across the longitudinal direction, near the\ntransition where black strings become unstable to the formation of black holes.\nIt is argued that the appropriate dynamics on the other (black hole) side of\nthe transition is that of the zero modes of the corresponding super Yang-Mills\ntheory. A suggestive mean field theory argument is given for the entropy of\nblack holes in all dimensions. Consequences of the analysis for matrix theory\nand the holographic principle are discussed.\n", "  We study the spectrum of 1+1 dimensional large $N$ QCD coupled to an adjoint\nMajorana fermion of mass $m$. As $m\\to 0$ this model makes a transition from\nconfinement to screening. We argue that in this limit the spectrum becomes\ncontinuous for mass greater than twice the mass of the lightest bound state.\nThis critical mass is nothing but the threshold for a decay into two lightest\nstates. We present numerical results based on DLCQ that appear to support our\nclaim.\n", "  We examine the system where a string stretches between pair of D-branes, and\nstudy the bending of the D-brane caused by the tension of the string. If the\ndistance between the pair of D-branes is sent to infinity, the tension of the\nstring stretching between them is strong enough to pull the spike all the way\nto infinity. We study the shape of these spikes when the branes are finite\ndistance apart using two different methods. First, we consider a string\nstretched between a pair of D2-branes in type IIA theory by going to the\nM-theory limit in which all of these branes are M-theory 2-branes embedded\nalong a holomorphic curve. Second, we consider a D-string stretched between a\npair of D3-branes in type IIB theory and infer the geometry of the D3-brane\nembeddings from the configuration of the adjoint scalar field in the magnetic\nmonopole solution of Prasad and Sommerfield. The case of fundamental string\nstretching between a pair of D3-branes follows from S-duality. The energy of\nthese configurations matches the expected value based on fundamental string and\nD-string tensions.\n", "  This paper considers the Schroedinger propagator on a cone with the conical\nsingularity carrying magnetic flux (``flux cone''). Starting from the operator\nformalism and then combining techniques of path integration in polar\ncoordinates and in spaces with constraints, the propagator and its path\nintegral representation are derived. \"Quantum correction\" in the Lagrangian\nappears naturally and no a priori assumption is made about connectivity of the\nconfiguration space.\n", "  We propose a generalization of the Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective\nlow-energy action for N=1 SUSY Yang-Mills theory which includes composite\noperators interpolating pure gluonic bound states. The chiral supermultiplet of\nanomalies is embedded in a larger three-form multiplet and an extra term in the\neffective action is introduced. The mass spectrum and mixing of the lowest-spin\nbound states are studied within the effective Lagrangian approach. The physical\nmass eigenstates form two multiplets, each containing a scalar, pseudoscalar\nand Weyl fermion. The multiplet containing the states which are most closely\nrelated to glueballs is the lighter one.\n", "  We derive sum rules for the magnetic and electric dipole moments of all\nparticle states of an N=2 supermultiplet. For short representations, we find\nagreement with previously determined N=1 sum rules, while there is added\nfreedom for long representations (expressed as certain scalar expectation\nvalues). With mild assumptions we find the simple result that the supersymmetry\ngenerated spin adds to the magnetic (electric) dipole moment with strength\ncorresponding to $g=2$ ($g_e=0$). This result is equally valid for N=1, this\ntime without any further assumptions.\n", "  In the low energy limit of for M-theory on S^1/Z_2, we calculate the gaugino\ncondensate potential in four dimensions using the background solutions due to\nHorava. We show that this potential is free of delta-function singularities and\nhas the same form as the potential in the weakly coupled heterotic string. A\ngeneral flux quantization rule for the three-form field of M-theory on S^1/Z_2\nis given and checked in certain limiting cases. This rule is used to fix the\nfree parameter in the potential originating from a zero mode of the form field.\nFinally, we calculate soft supersymmetry breaking terms. We find that\ncorrections to the Kahler potential and the gauge kinetic function, which can\nbe large in the strongly coupled region, contribute significantly to certain\nsoft terms. In particular, for supersymmetry breaking in the T-modulus\ndirection, the small values of gaugino masses and trilinear couplings that\noccur in the weakly coupled, large radius regime are enhanced to order m_3/2 in\nM-theory. The scalar soft masses remain small even, in the strong coupling\nM-theory limit.\n", "  We investigate the brane exchange in the framework of N=2 MQCD by using a\nspecific family of M fivebrane configurations relevant to describe the baryonic\nbranch root. An exchange of M fivebranes is realized in the Taub-NUT geometry\nand controlled by the moduli parameter of the configurations. This family also\nprovides two different descriptions of the root. These descriptions are\nexamined carefully using the Taub-NUT geometry. It is shown that they have the\nsame baryonic branch and are shifted each other by the brane exchange.\n", "  Various features of domain walls in supersymmetric gluodynamics are\ndiscussed. We give a simple field-theoretic interpretation of the phenomenon of\nstrings ending on the walls recently conjectured by Witten. An explanation of\nthis phenomenon in the framework of gauge field theory is outlined. The\nphenomenon is argued to be particularly natural in supersymmetric theories\nwhich support degenerate vacuum states with distinct physical properties. The\nissue of existence (or non-existence) of the BPS saturated walls in the\ntheories with glued (super)potentials is addressed. The amended\nVeneziano-Yankielowicz effective Lagrangian belongs to this class. The physical\norigin of the cusp structure of the effective Lagrangian is revealed, and the\nlimitation it imposes on the calculability of the wall tension is explained.\nRelated problems are considered. In particular, it is shown that the so called\ndiscrete anomaly matching, when properly implemented, does not rule out the\nchirally symmetric phase of supersymmetric gluodynamics, contrary to recent\nclaims.\n", "  We examine several aspects of the formulation of M(atrix)-Theory on ALE\nspaces. We argue for the existence of massless vector multiplets in the\nresolved $A_{n-1}$ spaces, as required by enhanced gauge symmetry in M-Theory,\nand that these states might have the correct gravitational interactions. We\npropose a matrix model which describes M-Theory on an ALE space in the presence\nof wrapped membranes. We also consider orbifold descriptions of matrix string\ntheories, as well as more exotic orbifolds of these models, and present a\nclassification of twisted matrix string theories according to Reid's exact\nsequences of surface quotient singularities.\n", "  Deriglazov and Galajinsky have recently proposed a new covariant action for\nthe Green-Schwarz superstring which can be constructed in any spacetime\ndimension. In this short note, I show that their action contains extra on-shell\ndegrees of freedom as compared with the standard action, and is therefore\ninequivalent.\n", "  Kappa-symmetric worldvolume actions of the D3-, M5- and M2-branes can be\ncoupled consistently to their near horizon bosonic geometry background. We\nstudy the gauge-fixed action in the approximation in which only the transverse\nradial direction of the brane is allowed to fluctuate. The generalized special\nconformal symmetry of these self-interacting actions is established. This opens\nup a possibility to find out if the full superconformal symmetry of the free\nactions of these branes survives in the presence of coupling defined by the\nsize of the anti-deSitter throat.\n", "  The gauged Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in the quenched-ladder approximation has\nnon-trivial dynamics near a critical scaling region (critical curve) separating\na chiral symmetric and a dynamically chiral symmetry broken phase. Scalar and\npseudoscalar composites corresponding to the four-fermion interaction become\nrelevant degrees of freedom at short distances, which is reflected in the\nappearance of a large anomalous dimension of the four-fermion operators. A\nmethod is introduced for solving the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the Yukawa\nvertex in specific kinematic regimes. This allows one to derive an analytic\nexpression for the scalar propagator, which is valid along the entire critical\ncurve. The mass and width of the scalar composites in the critical scaling\nregion are reexamined and the conformal phase transition at the critical gauge\ncoupling is discussed.\n", "  The motivation and the challenge in applying the renormalization group for\nsystems with several scaling regimes is briefly outlined. The four dimensional\n$\\phi^4$ model serves as an example where a nontrivial low energy scaling\nregime is identified in the vicinity of the spinodal instability region. It is\npointed out that the effective theory defined in the vicinity of the spinodal\ninstability offers an amplification mechanism, a precursor of the condensation\nthat can be used to explore nonuniversal forces at high energies.\n", "  We describe abstract (p,q) string networks which are the string networks of\nSen without the information about their embedding in a background spacetime.\nThe non-perturbative dynamical formulation invented for spin networks, in terms\nof causal evolution of dual triangulations, is applied to them. The formal\ntransition amplitudes are sums over discrete causal histories that evolve (p,q)\nstring networks. The dynamics depend on two free SL(2,Z) invariant functions\nwhich describe the amplitudes for the local evolution moves.\n", "  We show that the abelian topological mass mechanism in four dimensions,\ndescribed by the Cremmer-Sherk action, can be obtained from dimensional\nreduction in five dimensions. Starting from a gauge invariant action in five\ndimensions, where the dual equivalence between a massless vector field and a\nmassless second-rank antisymmetric field in five dimensions is established, the\ndimensional reduction is performed keeping only one massive mode. Furthermore,\nthe Kalb-Ramond action and the Stuckelberger formulation for massive spin-1 are\nrecovered.\n", "  We study the Euler numbers and the entropies of the non-extremal intersecting\nD-branes in ten-dimensions. We use the surface gravity to constrain the\ncompactification radii. We correctly obtain the integer valued Euler numbers\nfor these radii. Moreover, the entropies are found to be invariant under the\nT-duality transformation. In the extremal limit, we obtain the finite entropies\nonly for two intersecting D-branes. We observe that these entropies are\nproportional to the product of the charges of each D-brane. We further study\nthe entropies of the boosted metrics. We find that their entropies can be\ninterpreted in term of the microscopic states of D-branes.\n", "  We compute graviton scattering amplitudes in M-theory using Feynman rules for\na scalar particle coupled to gravity in eleven dimensions. The processes that\nwe consider describe the single graviton exchange and the double graviton\nexchange, that in M(atrix) theory correspond to the $v^4/r^7$- and\n$v^6/r^{14}$-term respectively. We further show that the $ v^6/r^{14}$-term\nappearing in M(atrix) theory at two-loops can be obtained from the covariant\neleven-dimensional four-graviton amplitude. Finally, we calculate the\n$v^8/r^{18}$-term appearing at two-loops in M(atrix) theory. It has been\npreviously conjectured that this term is related to a four graviton scattering\namplitude involving the $R^4$-vertex of M-theory.\n", "  In this note it is shown that near-extremal four dimensional dyonic black\nholes, where the dilaton is not constant, can be described by a microscopic\nmodel consisting of a one-dimensional gas of massless particles.\n", "  We propose a reformulation of Yang-Mills theory as a perturbative deformation\nof a novel topological (quantum) field theory. We prove that this reformulation\nof the four-dimensional QCD leads to quark confinement in the sense of area law\nof the Wilson loop. First, Yang-Mills theory with a non-Abelian gauge group G\nis reformulated as a deformation of a novel topological field theory. Next, a\nspecial class of topological field theories is defined by both BRST and\nanti-BRST exact action corresponding to the maximal Abelian gauge leaving the\nmaximal torus group H of G invariant. Then we find the topological field theory\n($D>2$) has a hidden supersymmetry for a choice of maximal Abelian gauge. As a\nresult, the D-dimensional topological field theory is equivalent to the\n(D-2)-dimensional coset G/H non-linear sigma model in the sense of Parisi and\nSourlas dimensional reduction. After maximal Abelian gauge fixing, the\ntopological property of magnetic monopole and anti-monopole of four-dimensional\nYang-Mills theory is translated into that of instanton and anti-instanton in\ntwo-dimensional equivalent model. It is shown that the linear static potential\nin four-dimensions follows from the instanton--anti-instanton gas in the\nequivalent two-dimensional non-linear sigma model obtained from the\nfour-dimensional topological field theory by dimensional reduction, while the\nremaining Coulomb potential comes from the perturbative part in\nfour-dimensional Yang-Mills theory. The dimensional reduction opens a path for\napplying various exact methods developed in two-dimensional quantum field\ntheory to study the non-perturbative problem in low-energy physics of\nfour-dimensional quantum field theories.\n", "  A simple, often invoked, regularization scheme of quantum mechanical path\nintegrals in curved space is mode regularization: one expands fields into a\nFourier series, performs calculations with only the first $M$ modes, and at the\nend takes the limit $M \\to \\infty$. This simple scheme does not manifestly\npreserve reparametrization invariance of the target manifold: particular\nnoncovariant terms of order $\\hbar^2$ must be added to the action in order to\nmaintain general coordinate invariance. Regularization by time slicing requires\na different set of terms of order $\\hbar^2$ which can be derived from Weyl\nordering of the Hamiltonian. With these counterterms both schemes give the same\nanswers to all orders of loops. As a check we perform the three-loop\ncalculation of the trace anomaly in four dimensions in both schemes. We also\npresent a diagrammatic proof of Matthews' theorem that phase space and\nconfiguration space path integrals are equal.\n", "  The trace anomaly for nonminimally coupled scalars in spherically reduced\ngravity obtained by Bousso and Hawking (hep-th/9705236) is incorrect. We\nexplain the reasons for the deviations from our correct (published) result\nwhich is supported by several other recent papers.\n", "  We discuss the propagation of scalars in a large class of non-extremal black\nhole and black p-brane geometries in generic dimensions. We show that the\nradial wave equation near the horizon possesses the SL(2,R) structure in every\ncase; approximately it takes the form of the wave equation in the SL(2,R)\n(AdS_3) background and has a symmetry related to the T-duality of the string\nmodel in that geometry. We see a close connection to two and three dimensional\nblack holes. We also find that, in some parameter region, the absorption\ncross-sections by the black objects take the form expected from a conformal\nfield theory. Our results indicate that some of the properties known about a\ncertain class of four and five dimensional black holes hold more generally.\n", "  We present a general framework for Matrix theory compactified on a quotient\nspace R^n/G, with G a discrete group of Euclidean motions in R^n. The general\nsolution to the quotient conditions gives a gauge theory on a noncommutative\nspace. We characterize the resulting noncommutative gauge theory in terms of\nthe twisted group algebra of G associated with a projective regular\nrepresentation. Also we show how to extend our treatments to incorporate\norientifolds.\n", "  It is shown that all string fields except dilaton are non-propagating in the\n(2+1)-dimensional black string. One finds that the perturbation around the\nblack string reveals a mixing between the dilaton and other fields. Under the\nnew gauge(dilaton gauge), we disentangle this mixing and obtain one decoupled\ndilaton equation. It turns out that this black string is stable. From the\nscattering of dilaton off the neutral black string(N=0), we find the absorption\ncross-section. Further the absorption cross-section for minimally coupled\nscalar is obtained and we compared it with that of dilaton.\n", "  We study supersymmetric QCD with N_f<N_c in the limit of small\nsupersymmetry-breaking masses and smaller quark masses using the weak-coupling\nKahler potential. We calculate the full spectrum of this theory, which\nmanifests a chiral symmetry breaking pattern similar to that caused by the\nstrong interactions of the standard model. We derive the chiral effective\nlagrangian for the pion degrees of freedom, and discuss the behavior in the\nformal limit of large squark and gluino masses and for large N_c. We show that\nthe resulting scalings of the pion decay constant and pion masses in these\nlimits differ from those expected in ordinary nonsupersymmetric QCD. Although\nthere is no weak coupling expansion with N_f=N_c, we extend our results to this\ncase by constructing a superfield quantum modified constraint in the presence\nof supersymmetry breaking.\n", "  Recently, a non-hyperelliptic curve describing the Coulomb branch of N=2 SUSY\n$SU(N_c)$ Yang-Mills theory with an antisymmetric tensor matter was proposed\nusing a configuration of a single M theory five-brane. We study the singular\nsurface in the moduli space of the curve to compare it with results from the\n``integrating in'' method in field theory. In order to achieve the consistency,\nwe find it necessary to take account of an additional superpotential\n$W_{\\Delta}$ which has been neglected so far. The explicit form of $W_{\\Delta}$\nis worked out.\n", "  We consider field theories with sixteen supersymmetries, which includes U(N)\nYang-Mills theories in various dimensions, and argue that their large N limit\nis related to certain supergravity solutions. We study this by considering a\nsystem of D-branes in string theory and then taking a limit where the brane\nworldvolume theory decouples from gravity. At the same time we study the\ncorresponding D-brane supergravity solution and argue that we can trust it in\ncertain regions where the curvature (and the effective string coupling, where\nappropriate) are small. The supergravity solutions typically have several\nweakly coupled regions and interpolate between different limits of\nstring-M-theory.\n", "  We reexamine the solvable model problem of two static, fundamental quarks\ninteracting with a SU(2) Yang-Mills field on a spatial circle, introduced by\nEngelhardt and Schreiber. If the quarks are at the same point, the model\nexhibits a quantum mechanical supersymmetry. At finite separation, the\nsupersymmetry is explicitly broken in a way which naturally explains the\ngeometrical nature of spectrum and state vectors of this system.\n", "  We have constructed a four-fermion theory coupled to a\nYang-Mills-Chern-Simons gauge field which admits static multi-vortex solutions.\nThis is achieved through the introduction of an anomalous magnetic interation\nterm in addition to the usual minimal coupling, and the appropriate choice of\nthe fermion quartic coupling constant.\n", "  We investigate the self-dual Yang-Mills gauge configurations on $R^3\\times\nS^1$ when the gauge symmetry SU(2) is broken to U(1) by the Wilson loop. We\nconstruct the explicit field configuration for a single instanton by the Nahm\nmethod and show that an instanton is composed of two self-dual monopoles of\nopposite magnetic charge. We normalize the moduli space metric of an instanton\nand study various limits of the field configuration and its moduli space\nmetric.\n", "  We analyze gauge symmetry enhancements $SO(16)\\to E_8$ on eight D7-branes and\n$SO(14)\\times U(1)\\to E_8$ on seven D7-branes from open strings. String\nconfigurations which we present in this paper are closely related to the ones\ngiven by Gaberdiel and Zwiebach. Our construction is based on $SO(8)\\times\nSO(8)$ decomposition and its relation to the D8-brane case via T-duality is\nclearer. Then we study supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on D3-brane near the\nD7-branes. This theory has flavour symmetry group which is equal to the gauge\ngroup on D7-branes. We suggest that when this symmetry is enhanced, two dyons\nmake bound states which, together with elementary quarks, constitute an $E_8$\nmultiplet.\n", "  We derive the hole probability and the distribution of the smallest\neigenvalue of chiral hermitian random matrices corresponding to Dirac operators\ncoupled to massive quarks in QCD. They are expressed in terms of the QCD\npartition function in the mesoscopic regime. Their universality is explicitly\nrelated to that of the microscopic massive Bessel kernel.\n", "  The supersymmetric Lagrangian compatible with the presence of torsion in the\nbackground spacetime requires, in addition to the minimal coupling, an\ninteraction between the spin and the torsion of the form ${1/2}\nN_{\\mu\\nu\\lambda\\rho}\\psi^\\mu\\psi^\\nu\\psi^\\lambda\\psi^\\rho$, where $N$ is the\nNieh-Yan 4-form. This gives rise to a coupling between helicity ($h$) and the\nNieh-Yan density of the form $hN$. The classical Lagrangian allows computing\nthe index for the Dirac operator on a four-dimensional compact manifold with\ncurvature and torsion using the path integral representation for the index.\nThis calculation provides an independent check for the recent result of the\nchiral anomaly in spaces with torsion.\n", "  We study BPS monopoles in 4 dimensional N=4 SO(N) and $Sp(N)$ super\nYang-Mills theories realized as the low energy effective theory of $N$\n(physical and its mirror) parallel D3 branes and an {\\it Orientifold 3 plane}\nwith D1 branes stretched between them in type IIB string theory. Monopoles on\nD3 branes give the natural understanding by embedding in SU(N) through the\nconstraints on both the asymptotic Higgs field (corresponding to the horizontal\npositions of D3 branes) and the magnetic charges (corresponding to the number\nof D1 branes) imposed by the O3 plane. The compatibility conditions of Nahm\ndata for monopoles for these groups can be interpreted very naturally through\nthe D1 branes in the presence of O3 plane.\n", "  We consider two-dimensional Brans-Dicke theory to study the initial\nsingularity problem. It turns out that the initial curvature singularity can be\nfinite for a certain Brans-Dicke constant $\\omega$ by considering the quantum\nback reaction of the geometry. For $\\omega=1$, the universe starts with the\nfinite curvature scalar and evolves into the flat spacetime. Furthermore the\ndivergent gravitational coupling at the initial time can be finite effectively\nwith the help of quantum correction. The other type of universe is studied for\nthe case of $0<\\omega<1$.\n", "  We construct multimonopole solutions containing N-1 distinct fundamental\nmonopoles in SU(N) gauge theory. When the gauge symmetry is spontaneously\nbroken to U(1)^{N-1}, the monopoles are all massive, and we show that the\nfields can be written in terms of elementary function for all values of the\nmonopole positions and phases. In the limit of unbroken U(1) X SU(N-2) X U(1)\nsymmetry, the configuration can be viewed as containing a pair of massive\nmonopoles, each carrying both U(1) and SU(N-2) magnetic charges, together with\nN-3 massless monopoles that condense into a cloud of non-Abelian fields. We\nobtain explicit expressions for the fields in the latter case and use these to\nanalyze the properties of the non-Abelian cloud.\n", "  An investigation of singular fields emerging in the process of transforming\nQCD to the axial gauge is presented. The structure of the singularities is\nanalyzed. It is shown that apart from well known neutral magnetic monopole\nsingularities, the field configurations also exhibit singularities in their\ncharged and transverse components. This complex singularity structure\nguarantees finite non-Abelian field strength and thus finite action if\nexpressed in terms of gauge fixed fields. A relation between the monopole\ncharges of singular field configurations and their topological charge is\nderived. Qualitative dynamical aspects of the role of the monopoles are\ndiscussed. It is argued that the entropy associated with monopoles increases\nwith decreasing temperature and that the coupling to quantum fluctuations\nfavors monopole-antimonopole binding.\n", "  We construct a duality between several simple physical systems by showing\nthat they are different aspects of the same quantum theory. Examples include\nthe free relativistic massless particle and the hydrogen atom in any number of\ndimensions. The key is the gauging of the Sp(2) duality symmetry that treats\nposition and momentum (x,p) as a doublet in phase space. As a consequence of\nthe gauging, the Minkowski space-time vectors (x^\\mu, p^\\mu) get enlarged by\none additional space-like and one additional time-like dimensions to (x^M,p^M).\nA manifest global symmetry SO(d,2) rotates (x^M,p^M) like d+2 dimensional\nvectors. The SO(d,2) symmetry of the parent theory may be interpreted as the\nfamiliar conformal symmetry of quantum field theory in Minkowski spacetime in\none gauge, or as the dynamical symmetry of a totally different physical system\nin another gauge. Thanks to the gauge symmetry, the theory permits various\nchoices of ``time'' which correspond to different looking Hamiltonians, while\navoiding ghosts. Thus we demonstrate that there is a physical role for a\nspacetime with two times when taken together with a gauged duality symmetry\nthat produces appropriate constraints.\n", "  This paper proposes a variational principle for the solutions of quantum\nfield theories in which the ``trial functions'' are chosen from the algebra of\nasymptotic fields, and illustrates this variational principle in simple cases.\n", "  We use the M theory approach in the presence of an orientifold O6 plane to\nunderstand some aspects of the moduli space of vacua for N=1 supersymmetric\n$SO(N_c)/Sp(N_c)$ gauge theories in four dimensions. By exploiting some general\nproperties of the O6 orientifold, we reproduce some results obtained previously\nwith an orientifold O4 plane when the flavor group arises from the worldvolume\ndynamics of D6 branes. By using semi-infinite D4 branes instead of D6 branes,\nwe derive the most general form of the rotated curve describing the moduli\nspace of vacua for N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory with massive matter.\n", "  In the light-cone Fock state expansion of gauge theories, the influence of\nnon-valence states may be significant in precision non-perturbative\ncalculations. In two-dimensional gauge theories, it is shown how these states\nmodify the behaviour of the light-cone wavefunction in significant ways\nrelative to endemic choices of variational ansatz. Similar effects in\nfour-dimensional gauge theories are briefly discussed.\n", "  We establish a duality between the free massless relativistic particle in d\ndimensions, the non-relativistic hydrogen atom (1/r potential) in (d-1) space\ndimensions, and the harmonic oscillator in (d-2) space dimensions with its mass\ngiven as the lightcone momentum of an additional dimension. The duality is in\nthe sense that the classical action of these systems are gauge fixed forms of\nthe same worldline gauge theory action at the classical level, and they are all\ndescribed by the same unitary representation of the conformal group SO(d,2) at\nthe quantum level. The worldline action has a gauge symmetry Sp(2) which treats\ncanonical variables (x,p) as doublets and exists only with a target spacetime\nthat has d spacelike dimensions and two timelike dimensions. This spacetime is\nconstrained due to the gauge symmetry, and the various dual solutions\ncorrespond to solutions of the constraints with different topologies. For\nexample, for the H-atom the two timelike dimensions X^{0'},X^{0} live on a\ncircle. The model provides an example of how realistic physics can be viewed as\nexisting in a larger covariant space that includes two timelike coordinates,\nand how the covariance in the larger space unifies different looking physics\ninto a single system.\n", "  We have extended the perturbative expansion method around the Gaussian\neffective action to the fermionic field theory, by taking the 2-dimensional\nGross-Neveu model as an example. We have computed both the zero temperature and\nthe finite temperature effective potentials of the Gross-Neveu model up to the\nfirst perturbative correction terms, and have found that the critical\ntemperature, at which dynamically broken symmetry is restored, is significantly\nimproved for small value of the flavour number.\n", "  We computed the statistical entropy of nonextremal 4D and extremal 5D\nCalabi-Yau black holes and found exact agreement with the Bekenstein-Hawking\nentropy. The computation is based on the fact that the near-horizon geometry of\nequivalent representations contains as a factor the\nBa\\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black hole and on subsequent use of Strominger's\nproposal generalizing the statistical count of microstates of the BTZ black\nhole due to Carlip.\n", "  We show that parity is conserved in vector-like supersymmetric theories, such\nas supersymmetric QCD with massive quarks with no cubic couplings among chiral\nmultiplets, based on fermionic path-integrals, originally developed by Vafa and\nWitten. We also look into the effect of supersymmetric breaking through gluino\nmasses, and see that the parity-conservation is intact also in this case. Our\nconclusion is valid, when only bosonic parity-breaking observable terms are\nconsidered in path-integrals like the original Vafa-Witten formulation.\n", "  We construct and explore BPS states that preserve 1/4 of supersymmetry in N=4\nYang-Mills theories. Such states are also realized as three-pronged strings\nending on D3-branes. We correct the electric part of the BPS equation and\nrelate its solutions to the unbroken abelian gauge group generators. Generic\n1/4-BPS solitons are not spherically symmetric, but consist of two or more\ndyonic components held apart by a delicate balance between static\nelectromagnetic force and scalar Higgs force. The instability previously found\nin three-pronged string configurations is due to excessive repulsion by one of\nthese static forces. We also present an alternate construction of these 1/4-BPS\nstates from quantum excitations around a magnetic monopole, and build up the\nsupermultiplet for arbitrary (quantized) electric charge. The degeneracy and\nthe highest spin of the supermultiplet increase linearly with a relative\nelectric charge. We conclude with comments.\n", "  We argue that supersymmetric higher-dimension operators in the effective\nactions of M-theory and IIB string theory do not affect the maximally\nsupersymmetric vacua: $adS_4\\times S^7$ and $adS_7\\times S^4$ in M-theory and\n$adS_5\\times S^5$ in IIB string theory. All these vacua are described in\nsuperspace by a fixed point with all components of supertorsion and\nsupercurvature being supercovariantly constant. This follows from 32 unbroken\nsupersymmetries and allows us to prove that such vacua are exact.\n", "  Naively, helicity flip amplitudes for fermions seem to vanish in the chiral\nlimit of light-front QCD, which would make it nearly impossible to generate a\nsmall pion mass in this framework. Using a simple model, it is illustrated how\na large helicity flip amplitude is generated dynamically by summing over an\ninfinite number of Fock space components. While the kinetic mass is basically\ngenerated by a zero-mode induced counter-term, the vertex mass is generated\ndynamically by infinitesimally small, but nonzero, momenta. Implications for\nthe renormalization of light-front Hamiltonians for fermions are discussed.\n", "  We address the delocalization of low dimensional D-branes and NS-branes when\nthey are a part of a higher dimensional BPS black brane, and the homogeneity of\nthe resulting horizon. We show that the effective delocalization of such branes\nis a classical effect that occurs when localized branes are brought together.\nThus, the fact that the few known solutions with inhomogeneous horizons are\nhighly singular need not indicate a singularity of generic D- and NS-brane\nstates. Rather, these singular solutions are likely to be unphysical as they\ncannot be constructed from localized branes which are brought together from a\nfinite separation.\n", "  The open inflation model recently proposed by Hawking and Turok is\ninvestigated in scalar-tensor gravity context. If the dilaton-like field has no\npotential, the instanton of our model is singular but has a finite action. The\nGibbons-Hawking surface term vanishes and hence, can not be used to make\n$\\Omega_0$ nonzero. To obtain a successful open inflation one should introduce\nother matter fields or a potential for the dilaton-like fields.\n", "  We investigate the details of the bulk-boundary correspondence in Lorentzian\nsignature anti-de Sitter space. Operators in the boundary theory couple to\nsources identified with the boundary values of non-normalizable bulk modes.\nSuch modes do not fluctuate and provide classical backgrounds on which bulk\nexcitations propagate. Normalizable modes in the bulk arise as a set of\nsaddlepoints of the action for a fixed boundary condition. They fluctuate and\ndescribe the Hilbert space of physical states. We provide an explicit, complete\nset of both types of modes for free scalar fields in global and Poincar\\'e\ncoordinates. For $\\ads{3}$, the normalizable and non-normalizable modes\noriginate in the possible representations of the isometry group\n$\\SL_L\\times\\SL_R$ for a field of given mass. We discuss the group properties\nof mode solutions in both global and Poincar\\'e coordinates and their relation\nto different expansions of operators on the cylinder and on the plane. Finally,\nwe discuss the extent to which the boundary theory is a useful description of\nthe bulk spacetime.\n", "  We study scattering of $D0$ branes in eleven dimensional supergravity (SUGRA)\nusing the tree level four point amplitude. The range of validity of SUGRA\nallows us to make reliable calculations of relativistic brane scattering,\ninaccessible in string theory because of halo effects. We also compare the rate\nof annihilation of $D0-\\bar{D0}$ branes to the rate of elastic $D0-\\bar{D0}$\nscattering and find that the former is always smaller than the latter. We also\nfind a pole in $\\sigma_{D0-\\bar{D0}}$. We exploit the analogy with the\npositronium to argue that the brane anti-brane pairs form branium atoms in 3\nspatial dimensions. We also derive a long range effective potential for\ninteracting branes which explicitly depends on their polarizations. We compare\ntwo approaches to large impact parameter brane scattering: in GR, polarizations\nof the branes are kept constant during the interaction, while in QFT, one sums\nover all possible polarizations. We show that the GR and QFT approaches give\nthe same answer.\n", "  Starting from Seiberg's electric-magnetic duality for supersymmetric QCD, we\nconstruct dual pairs of non-supersymmetric gauge theories. This is accomplished\nby first taking the large N limit of supersymmetric QCD and its dual partner\nand then performing a special ``orbifold projection'' recently introduced by\nKachru and Silverstein. We argue that in the large N limit the two projected\ntheories remain dual. The non-supersymmetric gauge theories which can be\nstudied in this fashion have non-supersymmetric field content, chiral fermions\nand exactly massless scalar matter.\n", "  We discuss simple cosmological solutions of Horava-Witten theory describing\nthe strongly coupled heterotic string. At energies below the grand-unified\nscale, the effective theory is five- not four-dimensional, where the additional\ncoordinate parameterizes a S^1/Z_2 orbifold. Furthermore, it admits no\nhomogeneous solutions. Rather, the vacuum state, appropriate for a reduction to\nfour-dimensional supersymmetric models, is a BPS domain wall. Relevant\ncosmological solutions are those associated with this BPS state. In particular,\nsuch solutions must be inhomogeneous, depending on the orbifold coordinate as\nwell as on time. We present two examples of this new type of cosmological\nsolution, obtained by separation of variables rather that by exchange of time\nand radius coordinate applied to a brane solution, as in previous work. The\nfirst example represents the analog of a rolling radii solution with the radii\nspecifying the geometry of the domain wall. This is generalized in the second\nexample to include a nontrivial ``Ramond-Ramond'' scalar.\n", "  We compute -in the saddle point approximation- the partition function for the\n2+1 black hole using the Gibbons-Hawking approach. Some issues concerning the\ndefinition of thermodynamical ensembles are clarified. It is pointed out that\nthe right action in covariant form is exactly equal to the Chern-Simons action\nwith no added boundary terms. This action is finite, yields the right canonical\nfree energy and has an extremum when the temperature and angular velocity are\nfixed. The correspondence with a 1+1 $CFT$ is indicated.\n", "  We show that a simple OSp(1/2) worldline gauge theory in 0-brane phase space\n(X,P), with spin degrees of freedom, formulated for a d+2 dimensional spacetime\nwith two times X^0,, X^0', unifies many physical systems which ordinarily are\ndescribed by a 1-time formulation. Different systems of 1-time physics emerge\nby choosing gauges that embed ordinary time in d+2 dimensions in different\nways. The embeddings have different topology and geometry for the choice of\ntime among the d+2 dimensions. Thus, 2-time physics unifies an infinite number\nof 1-time physical interacting systems, and establishes a kind of duality among\nthem. One manifestation of the two times is that all of these physical systems\nhave the same quantum Hilbert space in the form of a unique representation of\nSO(d,2) with the same Casimir eigenvalues. By changing the number n of spinning\ndegrees of freedom the gauge group changes to OSp(n/2). Then the eigenvalue of\nthe Casimirs of SO(d,2) depend on n and then the content of the 1-time physical\nsystems that are unified in the same representation depend on n. The models we\nstudy raise new questions about the nature of spacetime.\n", "  We consider the 1+1 dimensional N = (8,8) supersymmetric matrix field theory\nobtained from a dimensional reduction of ten dimensional N = 1 super\nYang-Mills. The gauge groups we consider are U(N) and SU(N), where N is finite\nbut arbitrary. We adopt light-cone coordinates, and choose to work in the\nlight-cone gauge. Quantizing this theory via Discretized Light-Cone\nQuantization (DLCQ) introduces an integer, K, which restricts the light-cone\nmomentum-fraction of constituent quanta to be integer multiples of 1/K.\nSolutions to the DLCQ bound state equations are obtained for K=2,3 and 4 by\ndiscretizing the light-cone super charges, which preserves supersymmetry\nmanifestly. We discuss degeneracies in the massive spectrum that appear to be\nindependent of the light-cone compactification, and are therefore expected to\nbe present in the decompactified limit K -> infinity. Our numerical results\nalso support the claim that the SU(N) theory has a mass gap.\n", "  The Dirac-Born-Infeld action with transverse scalar fields is considered to\nstudy the dynamics of various BPS states. We first describe the characteristic\nproperties of the so-called 1/2 and 1/4 BPS states on the D3 brane, which can\nbe interpreted as F/D-strings ending on a D3-brane in Type IIB string theory\npicture. We then study the response of the BPS states to low energy excitations\nof massless fields on the brane, the scalar fields representing the shape\nfluctuation of the brane and U(1) gauge fields describing the open string\nexcitations on the D-brane. This leads to an identification of interactions\nbetween BPS states including the static potentials and the kinetic\ninteractions.\n", "  We review the assumptions and the logic underlying the derivation of DLCQ\nMatrix models. In particular we try to clarify what remains valid at finite\n$N$, the role of the non-renormalization theorems and higher order terms in the\nsupergravity expansion. The relation to Maldacena's conjecture is also\ndiscussed. In particular the compactification of the Matrix model on $T_3$ is\ncompared to the $AdS_5\\times S_5$ ${\\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills duality, and\nthe different role of the branes in the two cases is pointed out.\n", "  High frequency dispersion does not alter the low frequency spectrum of\nHawking radiation from a single black hole horizon, whether the dispersion\nentails subluminal or superluminal group velocities. We show here that in the\npresence of an inner horizon as well as an outer horizon the superluminal case\ndiffers dramatically however. The negative energy partners of Hawking quanta\nreturn to the outer horizon and stimulate more Hawking radiation if the field\nis bosonic or suppress it if the field is fermionic. This process leads to\nexponential growth or damping of the radiated flux and correlations among the\nquanta emitted at different times, unlike in the usual Hawking effect. These\nphenomena may be observable in condensed matter black hole analogs that exhibit\n\"superluminal\" dispersion.\n", "  We describe a non-perturbative procedure for solving from first principles\nthe light-front Hamiltonian problem of SU(N) pure gauge theory in D spacetime\ndimensions (D>2), based on enforcing Lorentz covariance of observables. A\ntransverse lattice regulator and colour-dielectric link fields are employed,\ntogether with an associated effective potential. We argue that the light-front\nvacuum is necessarily trivial for large enough lattice spacing, and clarify why\nthis leads to an Eguchi-Kawai dimensional reduction of observables to\n1+1-dimensions in the infinite N limit. The procedure is then tested by\nexplicit calculations for 2+1-dimensional SU(infinity) gauge theory, within a\nfirst approximation to the lattice effective potential. We identify a scaling\ntrajectory which produces Lorentz covariant behaviour for the lightest\nglueballs. The predicted masses, in units of the measured string tension, are\nin agreement with recent results from conventional Euclidean lattice\nsimulations. In addition, we obtain the potential between heavy sources and the\nstructure of the glueballs from their light-front wavefunctions. Finally, we\nbriefly discuss the extension of these calculations to 3+1-dimensions.\n", "  Massless and massive scalar fields and massless spinor fields are considered\nat arbitrary temperatures in four dimensional ultrastatic curved spacetime.\nScalar models under consideration can be either conformal or nonconformal and\ninclude selfinteraction. The one-loop nonlocal effective action at finite\ntemperature and free energy for these quantum fields are found up to the second\norder in background field strengths using the covariant perturbation theory.\nThe resulting expressions are free of infrared divergences. Spectral\nrepresentations for nonlocal terms of high temperature expansions are obtained.\n", "  The relationship between N-soliton solutions to the Euclidean sine-Gordon\nequation and Lorentzian black holes in Jackiw-Teitelboim dilaton gravity is\ninvestigated, with emphasis on the important role played by the dilaton in\ndetermining the black hole geometry. We show how an N-soliton solution can be\nused to construct ``sine-Gordon'' coordinates for a black hole of mass M, and\nconstruct the transformation to more standard ``Schwarzchild-like''\ncoordinates. For N=1 and 2, we find explicit closed form solutions to the\ndilaton equations of motion in soliton coordinates, and find the relationship\nbetween the soliton parameters and the black hole mass. Remarkably, the black\nhole mass is non-negative for arbitrary soliton parameters. In the one-soliton\ncase the coordinates are shown to cover smoothly a region containing the whole\ninterior of the black hole as well as a finite neighbourhood outside the\nhorizon. A Hamiltonian analysis is performed for slicings that approach the\nsoliton coordinates on the interior, and it is shown that there is no boundary\ncontribution from the interior. Finally we speculate on the sine-Gordon\nsolitonic origin of black hole statistical mechanics.\n", "  The vacuum structure of N=2 (and N=4) SUSY Yang-Mills theory is analyzed in\ndetail by considering the effective potential for constant background scalar-\nmagnetic fields within different approximations. We compare the one-loop\napproximation with- or without instanton improved effective coupling with the\none-loop result in the dual desription. For N=2 we find that non-perturbative\nmonopole degrees of freedom remove the non-trivial minima present in the\n(improved) one-loop potential in the strong-coupling regime. The combination of\nYang-Mills and dual desription leads to a self-consistent effective potential\nover the full range of background fields.\n", "  We investigate cosmological solutions of eleven dimensional supergravity\ncompactified on a squashed seven manifold. The effective action for the four\ndimensional theory contains scalar fields describing the size and squashing of\nthe compactifying space. The potential for these fields consists of a sum of\nexponential terms. At early times only one such term is expected to dominate.\nThe condition for an exponential potential to admit inflationary solutions is\nderived and it is shown that inflation is not possible in our model. The\ncriterion for an exponential potential to admit a Hawking-Turok instanton is\nalso derived. It is shown that the instanton remains singular in eleven\ndimensions.\n", "  Previous work involving Born-regulated gravity theories in two dimensions is\nextended to four dimensions. The action we consider has two dimensionful\nparameters. Black hole solutions are studied for typical values of these\nparameters. For masses above a critical value determined in terms of these\nparameters, the event horizon persists. For masses below this critical value,\nthe event horizon disappears, leaving a ``bare mass'', though of course no\nsingularity.\n", "  It is well-known that all 2d models of gravity---including theories with\nnonvanishing torsion and dilaton theories---can be solved exactly, if matter\ninteractions are absent. An absolutely (in space and time) conserved quantity\ndetermines the global classification of all (classical) solutions. For the\nspecial case of spherically reduced Einstein gravity it coincides with the mass\nin the Schwarzschild solution. The corresponding Noether symmetry has been\nderived previously by P. Widerin and one of the authors (W.K.) for a specific\n2d model with nonvanishing torsion. In the present paper this is generalized to\nall covariant 2d theories, including interactions with matter. The related\nNoether-like symmetry differs from the usual one. The parameters for the\nsymmetry transformation of the geometric part and those of the matterfields are\ndistinct. The total conservation law (a zero-form current) results from a two\nstage argument which also involves a consistency condition expressed by the\nconservation of a one-form matter ``current''. The black hole is treated as a\nspecial case.\n", "  The local symmetry transformations of the quantum effective action for\ngeneral gauge theory are found. Additional symmetries arise under consideration\nof background gauges. Together with \"trivial\" gauge transformations, vanishing\non mass shell, they can be used for construction simple gauge generators. For\nexample, for the Yang-Mills theory the classically invariant effective action\nis obtained, reproducing DeWitt's result. For rank one theories a natural\ngeneralization is proposed.\n", "  In light of the AdS/CFT correspondence, it is natural to try to define a\nconformal field theory in a large N, strong coupling limit via a supergravity\ncompactification on the product of an Einstein manifold and anti-de Sitter\nspace. We consider the five-dimensional manifolds T^{pq} which are coset spaces\n(SU(2) x SU(2))/U(1). The central charge and a part of the chiral spectrum are\ncalculated, respectively, from the volume of T^{pq} and the spectrum of the\nscalar laplacian. Of the manifolds considered, only T^{11} admits any\nsupersymmetry: it is this manifold which characterizes the supergravity\nsolution corresponding to a large number of D3-branes at a conifold\nsingularity, discussed recently in hep-th/9807080. Through a field theory\nanalysis of anomalous three point functions we are able to reproduce the\ncentral charge predicted for the T^{11} theory by supergravity: it is 27/32 of\nthe central charge of the N=2 Z_2 orbifold theory from which it descends via an\nRG flow.\n", "  We have proposed the entropy formula of the black hole which is constructed\nby the intersecting D1-brane and D5-brane with no momentum, whose\ncompactification radii are constrained by the surface gravities in\nten-dimensions. We interpret the entropy of the black hole as the statistical\nentropy of the effective string living on the D5-brane. We further study the\nbehavior of the absorption cross-section of the black hole using our entropy\nformula.\n", "  An ambiguity in the computation of the one-loop effective action for fields\nliving on a cone is illustrated. It is shown that the ambiguity arises due to\nthe non-commutativity of the regularization of ultraviolet and (conical)\nboundary divergencies.\n", "  The temperature dependence of the anomalous sector of the effective action of\nfermions coupled to external gauge and pseudo-scalar fields is computed at\nleading order in an expansion in the number of Lorentz indices in two and four\ndimensions. The calculation preserves chiral symmetry and confirms that a\ntemperature dependence is compatible with axial anomaly saturation. The result\nchecks soft-pions theorems at zero temperature as well as recent results in the\nliterature for the pionic decay amplitude into static photons in the chirally\nsymmetric phase. The case of chiral fermions is also considered.\n", "  In an effort to further understand the structure of effective actions for\nfermions in an external gauge background at finite temperature, we study the\nexample of 1+1 dimensional fermions interacting with an arbitrary Abelian gauge\nfield. We evaluate the effective action exactly at finite temperature. This\neffective action is non-analytic as is expected at finite temperature. However,\ncontrary to the structure at zero temperature and contrary to naive\nexpectations, the effective action at finite temperature has interactions to\nall (even) orders (which, however, do not lead to any quantum corrections). The\ncovariant structure thus obtained may prove useful in studying 2+1 dimensional\nmodels in arbitrary backgrounds. We also comment briefly on the solubility of\nvarious 1+1 dimensional models at finite temperature.\n", "  Recently, the AdS/CFT conjecture of Maldacena has been investigated in\nLorentzian signature by Balasubramanian et. al. We extend this investigation to\nLorentzian BTZ black hole spacetimes, and study the bulk and boundary behaviour\nof massive scalar fields both in the non-extremal and extremal case. Using the\nbulk-boundary correspondence, we also evaluate the two-point correlator of\noperators coupling to the scalar field at the boundary of the spacetime, and\nfind that it satisfies thermal periodic boundary conditions relevant to the\nHawking temperature of the BTZ black hole.\n", "  Coincident D3-branes placed at a conical singularity are related to string\ntheory on $AdS_5\\times X_5$, for a suitable five-dimensional Einstein manifold\n$X_5$. For the example of the conifold, which leads to\n$X_5=T^{1,1}=(SU(2)\\times SU(2))/U(1)$, the infrared limit of the theory on $N$\nD3-branes was constructed recently. This is ${\\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric\n$SU(N)\\times SU(N)$ gauge theory coupled to four bifundamental chiral\nsuperfields and supplemented by a quartic superpotential which becomes marginal\nin the infrared. In this paper we consider D3-branes wrapped over the 3-cycles\nof $T^{1,1}$ and identify them with baryon-like chiral operators built out of\nproducts of $N$ chiral superfields. The supergravity calculation of the\ndimensions of such operators agrees with field theory. We also study the\nD5-brane wrapped over a 2-cycle of $T^{1,1}$, which acts as a domain wall in\n$AdS_5$. We argue that upon crossing it the gauge group changes to $SU(N)\\times\nSU(N+1)$. This suggests a construction of supergravity duals of ${\\cal N}=1$\nsupersymmetric $SU(N_1)\\times SU(N_2)$ gauge theories.\n", "  In the context of the conjectured AdS-CFT correspondence of string theory, we\nconsider a class of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter black holes whose conformal\nboundary consists of a single connected component, identical to the conformal\nboundary of Anti-de Sitter space. In a simplified model of the boundary theory,\nwe find that the boundary state to which the black hole corresponds is pure,\nbut this state involves correlations that produce thermal expectation values at\nthe usual Hawking temperature for suitably restricted classes of operators. The\nenergy of the state is finite and agrees in the semiclassical limit with the\nblack hole mass. We discuss the relationship between the black hole topology\nand the correlations in the boundary state, and speculate on generalizations of\nthe results beyond the simplified model theory.\n", "  We construct vacua of M-theory on S^1/Z_2 associated with Calabi-Yau\nthree-folds. These vacua are appropriate for compactification to N=1\nsupersymmetry theories in both four and five dimensions. We allow for general\nE_8 x E_8 gauge bundles and for the presence of five-branes. The five-branes\nspan the four-dimensional uncompactified space and are wrapped on holomorphic\ncurves in the Calabi-Yau space. Properties of these vacua, as well as of the\nresulting low-energy theories, are discussed. We find that the low-energy gauge\ngroup is enlarged by gauge fields that originate on the five-brane\nworld-volumes. In addition, the five-branes increase the types of new E_8 x E_8\nbreaking patterns allowed by the non-standard embedding. Characteristic\nfeatures of the low-energy theory, such as the threshold corrections to the\ngauge kinetic functions, are significantly modified due to the presence of the\nfive-branes, as compared to the case of standard or non-standard embeddings\nwithout five-branes.\n", "  We consider the 1+1 dimensional N = (2,2) supersymmetric matrix model which\nis obtained by dimensionally reducing N = 1 super Yang-Mills from four to two\ndimensions. The gauge groups we consider are U(Nc) and SU(Nc), where Nc is\nfinite but arbitrary. We adopt light-cone coordinates, and choose to work in\nthe light-cone gauge. Quantizing this theory via Discretized Light-Cone\nQuantization (DLCQ) introduces an integer, K, which restricts the light-cone\nmomentum-fraction of constituent quanta to be integer multiples of 1/K.\nSolutions to the DLCQ bound state equations are obtained for K=2,3,...,6 by\ndiscretizing the light-cone supercharges, which results in a supersymmetric\nspectrum. Our numerical results imply the existence of normalizable massless\nstates in the continuum limit K -> infinity, and therefore the absence of a\nmass gap. The low energy spectrum is dominated by string-like (or many parton)\nstates. Our results are consistent with the claim that the theory is in a\nscreening phase.\n", "  We describe the structure of the moduli space of $\\sigma$-model couplings for\nthe worldsheet description of a system of $N$ D-particles, in the case that the\ncouplings are represented by a pair of logarithmic recoil operators. We derive\nexpressions for the canonical momenta conjugate to the D-particle couplings and\nthe Zamolodchikov metric to the first few orders in $\\sigma$-model perturbation\ntheory. We show, using only very general properties of the operator product\nexpansion in logarithmic conformal field theories, that the canonical dynamics\non moduli space agree with the predictions of the non-abelian generalization of\nthe Born-Infeld effective action for D-particles with a symmetrized trace\nstructure. We demonstrate that the Zamolodchikov metric naturally encodes the\nshort-distance structure of spacetime, and from this we derive uncertainty\nrelations for the D-particle coordinates directly from the quantum string\ntheory. We show that the moduli space geometry naturally leads to new forms of\nspacetime indeterminancies involving only spatial coordinates of target space\nand illustrate the manner in which the open string interactions between\nD-particles lead to a spacetime quantization. We also derive appropriate\nnon-abelian generalizations of the string-modified Heisenberg uncertainty\nrelations and the space--time uncertainty principle. The non-abelian\nuncertainties exhibit decoherence effects suggesting the interplay of quantum\ngravity in multiple D-particle dynamics.\n", "  Adiabatic vacua are known to be Hadamard states. We show, however that the\nenergy-momentum tensor of a linear Klein-Gordon field on Robertson-Walker\nspaces developes a generic singularity on the initial hypersurface if the\nadiabatic vacuum is of order less than four. Therefore, adiabatic vacua are\nphysically reasonable only if their order is at least four.\n  A certain non-local large momentum expansion of the mode functions has\nrecently been suggested to yield the subtraction terms needed to remove the\nultraviolet divergences in the energy-momentum tensor. We find that this scheme\nfails to reproduce the trace anomaly and therefore is not equivalent to\nadiabatic regularisation.\n", "  We study noncompact and static membrane solutions in Matrix theory. Demanding\naxial symmetry on a membrane embedded in three spatial dimensions, we obtain a\nwormhole solution whose shape is the same with the catenoidal solution of\nBorn-Infeld theory. We also discuss another interesting class of solutions,\nmembranes embedded holomorphically in four spatial dimensions, which are 1/4\nBPS.\n", "  Recent results in the literature concerning holography indicate that the\nthermodynamics of quantum gravity (at least with a negative cosmological\nconstant) can be modeled by the large N thermodynamics of quantum field theory.\nWe emphasize that this suggests a completely unitary evolution of processes in\nquantum gravity, including black hole formation and decay; and even more\nextreme examples involving topology change. As concrete examples which show\nthat this correspondence holds even when the space-time is only locally\nasymptotically AdS, we compute the thermodynamical phase structure of the\nAdS-Taub-NUT and AdS-Taub-Bolt spacetimes, and compare them to a 2+1\ndimensional conformal field theory (at large N) compactified on a squashed\nthree sphere, and on the twisted plane.\n", "  We solve the Dirichlet boundary value problem for the massless gravitino on\n$AdS_{d+1}$ space and compute the two-point function of the dual CFT\nsupersymmetry currents using the $AdS$/CFT correspondence principle. We find\nanalogously to the spinor case that the boundary data for the massless $(d+1)$\ndimensional bulk gravitino field consists of only a $(d-1)$ dimensional\ngravitino.\n", "  We use the background field method along with a special gauge condition, to\nderive the hard thermal loop effective action in a simple manner. The new point\nin the paper is to relate the effective action explicitly to the S-matrix from\nthe onset.\n", "  We point out an interesting analogy between the BTZ black hole and QHE\n(Quantum Hall effect) in the (2+1)-dimensional bulk/boundary theories. It is\nshown that the Chern-Simons/Liouville(Chern-Simons/chiral boson) is an\neffective description for the BTZ black hole (QHE). Also the\nIR(bulk)-UV(boundary) connection for a black hole information bound is realized\nas the UV(low-lying excitations on bulk)-IR(long-range excitations on boundary)\nconnection in the QHE. An inflow of conformal anomaly($c=1$ central charge)\nonto the timelike boundary of AdS$_3$ by the Noether current corresponds to an\ninflow of chiral anomaly onto the edge of disk by the Hall current.\n", "  Making combined use of the Matrix and Maldacena conjectures, the relation\nbetween various thermodynamic transitions in super Yang-Mills (SYM) and\nsupergravity is clarified. The thermodynamic phase diagram of an object in DLCQ\nM-theory in four and five non-compact space dimensions is constructed; matrix\nstrings, matrix black holes, and black $p$-branes are among the various phases.\nCritical manifolds are characterized by the principles of correspondence and\nlongitudinal localization, and a triple point is identified. The microscopic\ndynamics of the Matrix string near two of the transitions is studied; we\nidentify a signature of black hole formation from SYM physics.\n", "  We present a new 1/8 supersymmetric intersecting M-brane solution of D=11\nsupergravity with two independent rotation parameters. The metric has a\nnon-singular event horizon and the near-horizon geometry is $adS_3\\times\nS^3\\times S^3\\times\\bE^2$ (just as in the non-rotating case). We also present a\nmethod of determining the isometry supergroup of supergravity solutions from\nthe Killing spinors and use it to show that for the near horizon solution it is\n$D(2|1,\\alpha)\\times D(2|1,\\alpha)$ where $\\alpha$ is the ratio of the two\n3-sphere radii. We also consider various dimensional reductions of our\nsolution, and the corresponding effect of these reductions on the Killing\nspinors and the isometry supergroups.\n", "  We discuss non-relativistic scattering by a Newtonian potential. We show that\nthe gray-body factors associated with scattering by a black hole exhibit the\nsame functional dependence as scattering amplitudes in the Newtonian limit,\nwhich should be the weak-field limit of any quantum theory of gravity. This\nbehavior arises independently of the presence of supersymmetry. The connection\nto two-dimensional conformal field theory is also discussed.\n", "  In this paper we study three point functions of the Type II superstring\ninvolving one graviton and two massive states, focusing in particular on the\nspin-7/2 fermions at the first mass level. Defining a gravitational quadrupole\n``h-factor'', we find that the non-minimal interactions of string states in\ngeneral are parametrized by $h\\ne1$, in contrast to the preferred field theory\nvalue of h=1 (for tree-level unitarity). This difference arises from the fact\nthat consistent gravitational interactions of strings are related to the\npresence of a complete tower of massive states, not present in the ordinary\nfield theory case.\n", "  We consider the classical solution of the type IIB supergravity spontaneously\ncompactified on S^5, whose metric depends only on the radial coordinate and\nwhose asymptotic geometry is locally that of AdS_5, i.e., R \\times S^1 \\times\nT^2. We solve the equations of motion to obtain the general solutions\nsatisfying these conditions, and find that the only naked-singularity-free\nsolutions are the AdS black holes and AdS solitons. The other solutions, that\nsmoothly interpolate these two solutions, are shown to have naked singularities\neven though their Ricci tensor is proportional to the metric with a negative\nconstant. Thus, among the possible solutions of this type, the AdS solitons are\nthe unique lowest energy solution; this result is consistent with the recently\nproposed positive energy conjecture for the IIB AdS supergravity on S^5.\n", "  In this paper, we give a simple diagrammatic identification of the unique\ncombination of the causal n-point vertex functions in the real time formalism\nthat would coincide with the corresponding functions obtained in the imaginary\ntime formalism. Furthermore, we give a simple calculational method for\nevaluating the temperature dependent parts of the retarded vertex functions, to\none loop, by identifying them with the forward scattering amplitudes of\non-shell thermal particles. As an application of the method, we calculate and\nshow that the temperature dependent parts of all the retarded functions vanish\nat one loop order for 1+1 dimensional massless QED. We further point out that,\nin this model, in fact, the temperature dependent parts of all the retarded\nvertex functions vanish to all orders in perturbation theory.\n", "  The operator product expansion for ``small'' Wilson loops in {\\cal N}=4, d=4\nSYM is studied. The OPE coefficients are calculated in the large N and g_{YM}^2\nN limit by exploiting the AdS/CFT correspondence. We also consider Wilson\nsurfaces in the (0,2), d=6 superconformal theory. In this case, we find that\nthe UV divergent terms include a term proportional to the rigid string action.\n", "  The massive non-relativistic free particle in d-1 space dimensions has an\naction with a surprizing non-linearly realized SO(d,2) symmetry. This is the\nsimplest example of a host of diverse one-time-physics systems with hidden\nSO(d,2) symmetric actions. By the addition of gauge degrees of freedom, they\ncan all be lifted to the same SO(d,2) covariant unified theory that includes an\nextra spacelike and an extra timelike dimension. The resulting action in d+2\ndimensions has manifest SO(d,2) Lorentz symmetry and a gauge symmetry Sp(2,R)\nand it defines two-time-physics. Conversely, the two-time action can be gauge\nfixed to diverse one-time physical systems. In this paper three new gauge fixed\nforms that correspond to the non-relativistic particle, the massive\nrelativistic particle, and the particle in AdS_(d-n) x S^n spacetime will be\ndiscussed. The last case is discussed at the first quantized and field theory\nlevels as well. For the last case the popularly known symmetry is SO(d-n-1,2) x\nSO(n+1), but yet we show that it is symmetric under the larger SO(d,2). In the\nfield theory version the action is symmetric under the full SO(d,2) provided it\nis improved with a quantized mass term that arises as an anomaly from operator\nordering ambiguities. The anomalous cosmological term vanishes for AdS_2 x S^0\nand AdS_n x S^n (i.e. d=2n). The strikingly larger symmetry could be\nsignificant in the context of the proposed AdS/CFT duality.\n", "  We compute the effective actions for the 0+1 dimensional scalar field\ninteracting with an Abelian gauge background, as well as for its supersymmetric\ngeneralization at finite temperature.\n", "  The large $N_c$ limit of Yang-Mills gauge theory is the dynamics of a closed\ngluonic chain, but this fact does not obviate the inherently strong coupling\nnature of the dynamical problem. However, we suggest that a single link in such\na chain might be reasonably described in the quasi-perturbative language of\ngluons and their interactions. To implement this idea, we use the MIT bag to\nmodel the physics of a nearest neighbor bond.\n", "  We investigate the connection between the BTZ black holes and the\nnear-horizon geometry of higher-dimensional black holes. Under mild conditions,\nwe show that (i) if a black hole has a global structure of the type of the\nnon-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes, its near-horizon geometry is\n$AdS_2$ times a sphere, and further (ii) if such a black hole is obtained from\na boosted black string by dimensional reduction, the near-horizon geometry of\nthe latter contains a BTZ black hole. Because of these facts, the calculation\nof the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and the absorption cross-sections of scalar\nfields is essentially reduced to the corresponding calculation in the BTZ\ngeometry under appropriate conditions. This holds even if the geometry is not\nsupersymmetric in the extremal limit. Several examples are discussed. We also\ndiscuss some generalizations to geometries which do not have $AdS$ near the\nhorizon.\n", "  The effective potential for the composite fields responsible for chiral\nsymmetry breaking in weakly coupled QED in a magnetic field is derived. The\nglobal minimum of the effective potential is found to acquire a non-vanishing\nexpectation value of the composite fields that leads to generating the\ndynamical fermion mass by an external magnetic field. The results are compared\nwith those for the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model.\n", "  In this brief report, we analyze a generalized theory of massless scalar\nQED_2 and show that, unlike the conventional scalar QED_2, it is free from\ninfrared divergence problems. The model is exactly soluble and may describe, in\nan 1+1 dimensional space-time, noninteracting spin-one tachyons.\n", "  The complete phase diagram of objects in M-theory compactified on tori $T^p$,\n$p=1,2,3$, is elaborated. Phase transitions occur when the object localizes on\ncycle(s) (the Gregory-Laflamme transition), or when the area of the localized\npart of the horizon becomes one in string units (the Horowitz-Polchinski\ncorrespondence point). The low-energy, near-horizon geometry that governs a\ngiven phase can match onto a variety of asymptotic regimes. The analysis makes\nit clear that the matrix conjecture is a special case of the Maldacena\nconjecture.\n", "  The OSp(2|2)-invariant planar dynamics of a D=4 superparticle near the\nhorizon of a large mass extreme black hole is described by an N=2\nsuperconformal mechanics, with the SO(2) charge being the superparticle's\nangular momentum. The {\\it non-manifest} superconformal invariance of the\nsuperpotential term is shown to lead to a shift in the SO(2) charge by the\nvalue of its coefficient, which we identify as the orbital angular momentum.\nThe full SU(1,1|2)-invariant dynamics is found from an extension to N=4\nsuperconformal mechanics.\n", "  The 256 dimensional M2-brane multiplet contains solitons of many different\nintrinsic spins. Using the broken supersymmetry transformations of the\nM2-brane, we find supergravity solutions which explicitly display these spins.\nThis amounts to quantizing the fermionic zero modes and computing the back\nreaction on the metric and gauge potential. These spacetime fields are\ntherefore operator valued and acquire a conventional classical meaning only\nafter taking expectations in given BPS states. Our spinning spacetimes are not\nof the standard Kerr form -- there is a non-vanishing gravitino. Nevertheless,\nthe solutions have angular momentum and magnetic dipole moments with a g-factor\nof 2. We use probe techniques to study scattering of spinning BPS M2-branes.\nThe static interactions cancel between like-sign branes at leading order, but\nthere are static spin-spin forces between branes and anti-branes. The general\nprobe-background Lagrangian contains gravitational spin-spin and magnetic\ndipole-dipole forces, as well as gravitino exchanges which allow branes to\nchange fermion number.\n", "  We consider the most general diffeomorphism invariant action in 1+1 spacetime\ndimensions that contains a metric, dilaton and Abelian gauge field, and has at\nmost second derivatives of the fields. Our action contains a topological term\n(linear in the Abelian field strength) that has not been considered in previous\nwork. We impose boundary conditions appropriate for a charged black hole\nconfined to a region bounded by a surface of fixed dilaton field and\ntemperature. By making some simplifying assumptions about the quantum theory,\nthe Hamiltonian partition function is obtained. This partition function is\nanalyzed in some detail for the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole and for the\nrotating BTZ black hole.\n", "  We consider three dimensional SU(N) N=1 super-Yang-Mills compactified on the\nspace-time R X S^1 X S^1. In particular, we compactify the light-cone\ncoordinate x^- on a light-like circle via DLCQ, and wrap the remaining\ntransverse coordinate on a spatial circle. By retaining only the first few\nexcited modes in the transverse direction, we are able to solve for bound state\nwave functions and masses numerically by diagonalizing the discretized\nlight-cone supercharge. This regularization of the theory is shown to preserve\nsupersymmetry. We plot bound state masses as a function of the coupling,\nshowing the transition in particle masses as we move from a weakly to a\nstrongly-coupled theory. We analyze both numerically and analytically massless\nstates which exist only in the limit of strong or weak gauge coupling. In\naddition, we find massless states that persist for all values of the gauge\ncoupling. An analytical treatment of these massless states is provided.\nInterestingly, in the strong coupling limit, these massless states become\nstring-like.\n", "  The effective one-loop action for general dilaton theories with arbitrary\ndilaton-dependent measure and nonminimal coupling to scalar matter is computed.\nAs an application we determine the Hawking flux to infinity from black holes in\nd-dimensions. We resolve the recently resurrected problem of an apparent\nnegative flux for nonminimally coupled scalars: For any $D \\geq 4$ Black Hole\nthe complete flux turns out to be precisely the one of minimal coupling. This\nresult is obtained from a Christensen-Fulling type argument involving the\n(non-)conservation of energy-momentum. It is compared with approaches using the\neffective action.\n", "  In this paper we investigate N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories with a product\ngauge group. By using smoothly confining dynamics, we can find new dualities\nwhich include higher-rank tensor fields, and in which the dual gauge group is\nsimple, not a product. Some of them are dualities between chiral and non-chiral\ngauge theories. We also discuss some applications to dynamical supersymmetry\nbreaking phenomena and new confining theories with a tree-level superpotential.\n", "  We analyze the structure of the moduli space of a supersymmetric SU(5) chiral\ngauge theory with two matter fields in the 10 representation, and two fields in\nthe \\bar{5} representation. Inspection of the exact Kahler potential of the\nclassical moduli space shows that the symmetry group of the moduli space is\nlarger than the global symmetry group of the underlying gauge theory. As a\nconsequence, the gauge theory has classical inequivalent vacua which yield\nidentical low energy theories.\n", "  We develop a formalism to evaluate generic scalar exchange diagrams in\nAdS_{d+1} relevant for the calculation of four-point functions in AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. The result may be written as an infinite power series of\nfunctions of cross-ratios. Logarithmic singularities appear in all orders\nwhenever the dimensions of involved operators satisfy certain relations. We\nshow that the AdS_{d+1} amplitude can be written in a form recognisable as the\nconformal partial wave expansion of a four-point function in CFT_{d} and\nidentify the spectrum of intermediate operators. We find that, in addition to\nthe contribution of the scalar operator associated with the exchanged field in\nthe AdS diagram, there are also contributions of some other operators which may\npossibly be identified with two-particle bound states in AdS. The CFT\ninterpretation also provides a useful way to ``regularize'' the logarithms\nappearing in AdS amplitude.\n", "  Hamiltonian light-front field theory can be used to solve for hadron states\nin QCD. To this end, a method has been developed for systematic renormalization\nof Hamiltonian light-front field theories, with the hope of applying the method\nto QCD. It assumed massless particles, so its immediate application to QCD is\nlimited to gluon states or states where quark masses can be neglected. This\npaper builds on the previous work by including particle masses\nnon-perturbatively, which is necessary for a full treatment of QCD. We show\nthat several subtle new issues are encountered when including masses\nnon-perturbatively. The method with masses is algebraically and conceptually\nmore difficult; however, we focus on how the methods differ. We demonstrate the\nmethod using massive phi^3 theory in 5+1 dimensions, which has important\nsimilarities to QCD.\n", "  We study a three-dimensional gauge theory obtained from the dimensional\nreduction of a D4-brane worldvolume theory in the background of space-time\nmoduli. An SL(3) symmetry in this theory, which acts on fields as well as\ncoupling constants, is identified. By comparing the energies with the string\ntensions, we show that certain 1/2 supersymmetric classical solutions of this\ntheory can be identified as SL(3,Z) multiplets of type II strings in eight\ndimensions. Results are then generalized to the non-linear Born-Infeld action.\nWe also discuss the possibility of 1/8 BPS states in this theory and their\nrepresentations in terms of string networks.\n", "  The $S^N\\R^8$ supersymmetric orbifold sigma model is expected to describe the\nIR limit of the Matrix string theory. In the framework of the model the type\nIIA string interaction is governed by a vertex which was recently proposed by\nR.Dijkgraaf, E.Verlinde and H.Verlinde. By using this interaction vertex we\nderive all four particle scattering amplitudes directly from the orbifold model\nin the large $N$ limit.\n", "  Generalizing previous results for orbifolds, in this paper we describe the\ncompactification of Matrix model on an orientifold which is a quotient space as\na Yang-Mills theory living on a quantum space. The information of the\ncompactification is encoded in the action of the discrete symmetry group G on\nEuclidean space and a projective representation U of G. The choice of Hilbert\nspace on which the algebra of U is realized as an operator algebra corresponds\nto the choice of a physical background for the compactification. All these data\nare summarized in the spectral triple of the quantum space.\n", "  We construct an Sp(2,R) gauge invariant particle action which possesses\nmanifest space-time SO(d,2) symmetry, global supersymmetry and kappa\nsupersymmetry. The global and local supersymmetries are non-abelian\ngeneralizations of Poincare type supersymmetries and are consistent with the\npresence of two timelike dimensions. In particular, this action provides a\nunified and explicit superparticle representation of the superconformal groups\nOSp(N/4), SU(2,2/N) and OSp(8*/N) which underlie various AdS/CFT dualities in\nM/string theory. By making diverse Sp(2,R) gauge choices our action reduces to\ndiverse one-time physics systems, one of which is the ordinary (one-time)\nmassless superparticle with superconformal symmetry that we discuss explicitly.\nWe show how to generalize our approach to the case of superalgebras, such as\nOSp(1/32), which do not have direct space-time interpretations in terms of only\nzero branes, but may be realizable in the presence of p-branes.\n", "  We study a possible symmetrical behavior of the effective charges defined in\nthe Euclidean and Minkowskian regions and prove that such symmetry is\ninconsistent with the causality principle.\n", "  The electromagnetic interaction of massive superparticles with N=2 extended\nMaxwell supermultiplet is studied. It is proved that the minimal coupling\nbreaks the k-symmetry. A non-minimal k-symmetric action is built and it is\nestablished that the k-symmetry uniquely fixes the value of the superparticle's\nanomalous magnetic moment\n", "  We describe the investigation of spontaneous mass-generation and chiral\nsymmetry breaking in supersymmetric QED3 using numerical solutions of the\nDyson-Schwinger equation together with the CJT effective action and\nsupersymmetric Ward identities. We find that, within the quenched bare\napproximation, the chirally symmetric solution is favoured.\n", "  We investigate monopole solutions for the Born-Infeld Higgs system. We\nanalyze numerically these solutions and compare them with the standard 't\nHooft-Polyakov monopoles. We also discuss the existence of a critical value of\nbeta (the Born-Infeld \"absolute field parameter\") below which no regular\nsolution exists.\n", "  The effects of extra space-time dimensions on the Wilsonian effective\nK\\\"ahler potential and the perturbative one loop effective K\\\"ahler potential\nare determined within the framework of an Abelian gauge theory with N=2\nsupersymmetric field content. The relation between the K\\\"ahler metric and the\neffective gauge couplings which leads to the absence of radiative corrections\nto the K\\\"ahler potential is expressed as a function of the radius of\ncompactification of a fifth dimension. In general, the quantum corrections to\nthe low energy K\\\"ahler potential are shown to grow with this radius reflecting\nthe underlying higher dimensional nature of the theory.\n", "  We compute the 3-point function of the stress-energy tensor in the\nd-dimensional CFT from the AdS_{d+1} gravity. For d=4 the coefficients of the\nthree linearly independent conformally covariant forms entering the 3-point\nfunction are exactly the same as given by the free field computations in the\n${\\cal N}=4$ SYM just as expected from the known renormalization theorems. For\nd=3 and d=6 our results give the value of the corresponding 3-point function in\nthe theories of strongly coupled ${\\cal N}=8$ superconformal scalar and (2,0)\ntensor multiplets respectively.\n", "  The graviton self-energy at finite temperature depends on fourteen structure\nfunctions. We show that, in the absence of tadpoles, the gauge invariance of\nthe effective action imposes three non-linear relations among these functions.\nThe consequences of such constraints, which must be satisfied by the thermal\ngraviton self-energy to all orders, are explicitly verified in general linear\ngauges to one loop order.\n", "  The phase diagram for Dp-branes in M-theory compactified on $T^4$, $T^4/Z_2$,\n$T^5$, and $T^6$ is constructed. As for the lower-dimensional tori considered\nin our previous work (hep-th/9810224), the black brane phase at high entropy\nconnects onto matrix theory at low entropy; we thus recover all known instances\nof matrix theory as consequences of the Maldacena conjecture. The difficulties\nthat arise for $T^6$ are reviewed. We also analyze the D1-D5 system on $T^5$;\nwe exhibit its relation to matrix models of M5-branes, and use spectral flow as\na tool to investigate the dependence of the phase structure on angular\nmomentum.\n", "  The classical probe dynamics of the eleven-dimensional massless\nsuperparticles in the background geometry produced by N source M-momenta is\ninvestigated in the framework of N-sector DLCQ supergravity. We expand the\nprobe action up to the two fermion terms and find that the fermionic\ncontributions are the spin-orbit couplings, which precisely agree with the\nmatrix theory calculations. We comment on the lack of non-perturbative\ncorrections in the one-loop matrix quantum mechanics effective action and its\ncompatibility with the supergravity analysis.\n", "  Inflationary solutions are constructed in a specific five-dimensional model\nwith boundaries motivated by heterotic M-theory. We concentrate on the case\nwhere the vacuum energy is provided by potentials on those boundaries. It is\npointed out that the presence of such potentials necessarily excites bulk\nKaluza-Klein modes. We distinguish a linear and a non-linear regime for those\nmodes. In the linear regime, inflation can be discussed in an effective\nfour-dimensional theory in the conventional way. We lift a four-dimensional\ninflating solution up to five dimensions where it represents an inflating\ndomain wall pair. This shows explicitly the inhomogeneity in the fifth\ndimension. We also demonstrate the existence of inflating solutions with\nunconventional properties in the non-linear regime. Specifically, we find\nsolutions with and without an horizon between the two boundaries. These\nsolutions have certain problems associated with the stability of the additional\ndimension and the persistence of initial excitations of the Kaluza-Klein modes.\n", "  In this paper, we extend our earlier one loop analysis to two loops and give\na simple diagrammatic description for the retarded Greens functions at finite\ntemperature, in terms of forward scattering amplitudes of on-shell thermal\nparticles. We present a simple discussion, which can be easily generalized to\nany field theory, of the temperature dependent parts of the retarded two and\nthree point functions in scalar field theory and QED. As an application of our\nresult at two loops, we show how the infrared singularities in the thermal part\nof the retarded photon self-energy, cancel in QED_2 in the limit of vanishing\nelectron mass.\n", "  The spacetime superalgebra via the supermembrane probe in the background of\nAdS_4 \\times S^7 is discussed to the lowest order in the spinor coordinate\n$\\t$. To obtain the correct spacetime superalgebras, all $\\t^2$ order\ncorrections for supervielbein and super 3-form gauge potential have to be\nincluded. The central extension of the superalgebra OSp(8|4) of the super\nisometries for AdS_4 \\times S^7 is found.\n", "  A charged superconductiong cosmic string produces an extremely large electric\nfield in its vicinity. This leads to vacuum instability and to the formation of\na charged vacuum condensate which screens the electric charge of the string. We\nanalyze the structure of this condensate using the Thomas-Fermi method.\n", "  I study the global structure of de Sitter space in the semi-classical and\none-loop approximations to quantum gravity. The creation and evaporation of\nneutral black holes causes the fragmentation of de Sitter space into\ndisconnected daughter universes. If the black holes are stabilized by a charge,\nI find that the decay leads to a necklace of de Sitter universes (`beads')\njoined by near-extremal black hole throats. For sufficient charge, more and\nmore beads keep forming on the necklace, so that an unbounded number of\nuniverses will be produced. In any case, future infinity will not be connected.\nThis may have implications for a holographic description of quantum gravity in\nde Sitter space.\n", "  We investigate zero modes of the Dirac operator coupled to an Abelian gauge\nfield in three dimensions. We find that the existence of a certain class of\nzero modes is related to a specific topological property precisely when the\nrequirement of finite Chern--Simons action is imposed.\n", "  We present a simple and systematic method to calculate the Rindler noise,\nwhich is relevant to the analysis of the Unruh effect, by using the\nfluctuation-dissipative theorem. To do this, we calculate the dissipative\ncoefficient explicitly from the equations of motion of the detector and the\nfield. This method gives not only the correct answer but also a hint as to the\norigin of the apparent statistics inversion effect. Moreover, this method is\ngeneralized to the Dirac field, by using the fermionic fluctuation-dissipation\ntheorem. We can thus confirm that the fermionic fluctuation-dissipation theorem\nis working properly.\n", "  Compact canonical quantization on the light cone (DLCQ) is examined in the\nlimit of infinite periodicity lenth L. Pauli Jordan commutators are found to\napproach continuum expressions with marginal non causal terms of order\n$L^{-3/4}$ traced back to the handling of IR divergence through the elimination\nof zero modes. In contrast direct quantization in the continuum (CLCQ) in terms\nof field operators valued distributions is shown to provide the standard causal\nresult while at the same time ensuring consistent IR and UV renormalization.\n", "  We analytically and numerically investigate the 't Hooft-Bergknoff-Eller\nequations, the lowest order mesonic Light-Front Tamm-Dancoff equations for\nU(N_C) and SU(N_C) gauge theories. We find the wavefunction can be well\napproximated by new basis functions and obtain an analytic formula for the mass\nof the lightest bound state. Its value is consistent with the precedent\nresults.\n", "  Twisted sectors --solutions to the equations of motion with non-trivial\nmonodromies-- of three dimensional Euclidean gravity are studied. We argue that\nupon quantization this new sector of the theory provides the necessary (and no\nmore) degrees of freedom to account for the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.\n", "  See hep-th/9907179.\n", "  We discuss various approaches to extracting the full stress-energy tensor of\nthe conformal field theory from the corresponding supergravity solutions,\nwithin the framework of the Maldacena conjecture. This provides a more refined\nprobe of the AdS/CFT correspondence. We apply these techniques in considering\nthe Casimir energy of the conformal field theory on a torus. It seems that\neither generically the corresponding supergravity solutions are singular (i.e.,\ninvolve regions of large string-scale curvatures), or that they are largely\ninsensitive to the boundary conditions of the CFT on the torus.\n", "  The search for intersecting brane solutions in supergravity is a large and\nprofitable industry. Recently, attention has focused on finding localized forms\nof known `delocalized' solutions. However, in some cases, a localized version\nof the delocalized solution simply does not exist. Instead, localized separated\nbranes necessarily delocalize as the separation is removed. This phenomenon is\nrelated to black hole no-hair theorems, i.e. `baldness.' We continue the\ndiscussion of this effect and describe how it can be understood, in the case of\nDirichlet branes, in terms of the corresponding intersection field theory. When\nit occurs, it is associated with the quantum mixing of phases and lack of\nsuperselection sectors in low dimensional field theories. We find surprisingly\nwide agreement between the field theory and supergravity both with respect to\nwhich examples delocalize and with respect to the rate at which this occurs.\n", "  We describe a scheme for constructing the holographic dual of the full\nD3-brane geometry with charge $K$ by embedding it into a large anti-de Sitter\nspace of size $N$. Such a geometry is realized in a multi-center anti-de Sitter\ngeometry which admits a simple field theory interpretation as $SU(N+K)$ gauge\ntheory broken to $SU(N) \\times SU(K)$. We find that the characteristic size of\nthe D3-brane geometry is of order $(K/N)^{1/4} U^0$ where $U^0$ is the scale of\nthe Higgs. By choosing $N$ to be much larger than $K$, the scale of the\nD3-brane metric can be well separated from the Higgs scale in the radial\ncoordinate. We generalize the holographic energy-distance relation and estimate\nthe characteristic energy scale associated with these radial scales, and find\nthat the $E/U$ relation becomes effectively $U$ independent in the range\n$(K/N)^{1/2} U^0 < U < U^0$. This implies that all detailed structure of the\nD3-brane geometry is encoded in the fine structure of the boundary gauge theory\nat around the Higgs scale.\n", "  The information paradox in the quantum evolution of black holes is studied\nwithin the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The unitarity of the CFT\nstrongly suggests that all information about an initial state that forms a\nblack hole is returned in the Hawking radiation. The CFT dynamics implies an\ninformation retention time of order the black hole lifetime. This fact\ndetermines many qualitative properties of the non-local effects that must show\nup in a semi-classical effective theory in the bulk. We argue that no\nviolations of causality are apparent to local observers, but the semi-classical\ntheory in the bulk duplicates degrees of freedom inside and outside the event\nhorizon. Non-local quantum effects are required to eliminate this redundancy.\nThis leads to a breakdown of the usual classical-quantum correspondence\nprinciple in Lorentzian black hole spacetimes.\n", "  We examine the recently proposed technique of adding boundary counterterms to\nthe gravitational action for spacetimes which are locally asymptotic to anti-de\nSitter. In particular, we explicitly identify higher order counterterms, which\nallow us to consider spacetimes of dimensions d<=7. As the counterterms\neliminate the need of ``background subtraction'' in calculating the action, we\napply this technique to study examples where the appropriate background was\nambiguous or unknown: topological black holes, Taub-NUT-AdS and Taub-Bolt-AdS.\nWe also identify certain cases where the covariant counterterms fail to render\nthe action finite, and we comment on the dual field theory interpretation of\nthis result. In some examples, the case of vanishing cosmological constant may\nbe recovered in a limit, which allows us to check results and resolve\nambiguities in certain asymptotically flat spacetime computations in the\nliterature.\n", "  We describe the Brown-Henneaux asymptotic symmetry of the general black holes\nin the Chern-Simons gauge theory of the gauge group $SL(2;{\\bf R})_L\\times\nSL(2;{\\bf R})_R$. We make it clear that the vector-like subgroup $SL(2; {\\bf\nR})_{L+R}$ plays an essential role in describing the asymptotic symmetry\nconsistently. We find a quite general black hole solution in the $AdS_3$\ngravity theory. The solution is specified by an infinite number of conserved\nquantities which constitute a family of mapping from $S^1$ to the gauge group.\nThe BTZ black hole is one of the simplest case.\n", "  We show that in the functional integral formalism the (finite) coefficient of\nthe induced, Lorentz- and CPT-violating Chern-Simons term, arising from the\nLorentz- and CPT-violating fermion sector, is undetermined.\n", "  We generalize the background gauge in the Matrix model to propose a new gauge\nwhich is useful for discussing the conformal symmetry. In this gauge, the\nspecial conformal transformation (SCT) as the isometry of the near-horizon\ngeometry of the D-particle solution is directly reproduced with the correct\ncoefficient as the quantum correction to the SCT in the Matrix model. We also\npresent a general argument for the relation between the gauge choice and the\nfield redefinition in the Matrix model.\n", "  We study static spherically symmetric dyonic black holes in\nEinstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. As for the magnetic non-abelian black holes,\nthe domain of existence of the dyonic non-abelian black holes is limited with\nrespect to the horizon radius and the dimensionless coupling constant $\\alpha$,\nwhich is proportional to the ratio of vector meson mass and Planck mass. At a\ncertain critical value of this coupling constant, $\\hat \\alpha$, the maximal\nhorizon radius is attained. We derive analytically a relation between $\\hat\n\\alpha$ and the charge of the black hole solutions and confirm this relation\nnumerically. Besides the fundamental dyonic non-abelian black holes, we study\nradially excited dyonic non-abelian black holes and globally regular\ngravitating dyons.\n", "  We consider one-loop quantum corrections to the thermodynamics of a black\nhole in generic 2-dimensional dilaton gravity. The classical action is the most\ngeneral diffeomorphism invariant action in 1+1 space-time dimensions that\ncontains a metric, dilaton, and Abelian gauge field, and having at most second\nderivatives of the fields. Quantum corrections are introduced by considering\nthe effect of matter fields conformally coupled to the metric and non-minimally\ncoupled to the dilaton. Back reaction of the matter fields (via non-vanishing\ntrace conformal anomaly) leads to quantum corrections to the black hole\ngeometry. Quantum corrections also lead to modifications in the gravitational\naction and hence in expressions for thermodynamic quantities. One-loop\ncorrections to both geometry and thermodynamics (energy, entropy) are\ncalculated for the generic dilaton theory. This formalism is applied to a\ncharged black hole in spherically symmetric gravity and to a rotating BTZ black\nhole.\n", "  We study the generalized conformal quantum mechanics of the probe D0-brane in\nthe near horizon background of the bound state of source D0-branes. We\nelaborate on the relationship of such model to the M theory in the light cone\nframe.\n", "  We consider perturbative Type II superstring theory in the covariant NSR\nformalism in the presence of NSNS and RR backgrounds. A concrete example that\nwe have in mind is the geometry of D3-branes which in the near-horizon region\nis AdS_5 x S_5, although our methods may be applied to other backgrounds as\nwell. We show how conformal invariance of the string path integral is\nmaintained order by order in the number of holes. This procedure makes uses of\nthe Fischler-Susskind mechanism to build up the background geometry. A simple\nformal expression is given for a \\sigma-model Lagrangian. This suggests a\nperturbative expansion in 1/g^2N and 1/N. As applications, we consider at\nleading order the mixing of RR and NSNS states, and the realization of the\nspacetime supersymmetry algebra.\n", "  By quantizing an open string ending on a D-brane in a nontrivial supergravity\nbackground, we argue that there is a new kind of uncertainty relation on a\nD-brane worldvolume. Furthermore, we fix the form of the uncertainty relations\nand their dependence on the string coupling constant by requiring them to be\nconsistent with various string theory and M theory dualities. In this way we\nfind a web of uncertainties of spacetime for all kinds of brane probes,\nincluding fundamental strings, D-branes of all dimensions as well as M theory\nmembranes and fivebranes.\n", "  We investigate and contrast the non-perturbative infra red structure of N=1\nand N=2 supersymmetric non-compact U(1) gauge field theory in three space-time\ndimensions with N matter flavours. We study the Dyson-Schwinger equations in a\ngeneral gauge using superfield formalism; this ensures that supersymmetry is\nkept manifest, though leads to spurious infra red divergences which we have to\navoid carefully. In the N=1 case the superfield formalism allows us to choose a\nvertex which satisfies the U(1) Ward identity exactly, and we find the expected\ncritical behaviour in the wavefunction renormalization and strong evidence for\nthe existence of a gauge independent dynamically generated mass, but with no\nevidence for a critical flavour number. We study the N=2 model by dimensional\nreduction from four dimensional N=1 electrodynamics, and we refine the old\ngauge dependence argument that there is no dynamical mass generation. We\nrecognize that the refinement only holds after dimensional reduction.\n", "  The thermodynamics of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories is studied by\ncomputing the two-loop correction to the canonical free energy and to the\nequation of state for theories with 16, 8 and 4 supercharges in any dimension\n$4\\leq d\\leq 10$, and in two dimensions at finite volume. In the\nfour-dimensional case we also evaluate the first non-analytic contribution in\nthe 't Hooft coupling to the free energy, arising from the resummation of ring\ndiagrams. To conclude, we discuss some applications to the study of the\nHagedorn transition in string theory in the context of Matrix strings and\nspeculate on the possible physical meaning of the transition.\n", "  We study the near horizon limit of a four dimensional extreme rotating black\nhole. The limiting metric is a completely nonsingular vacuum solution, with an\nenhanced symmetry group SL(2,R) x U(1). We show that many of the properties of\nthis solution are similar to the AdS_2 x S^2 geometry arising in the near\nhorizon limit of extreme charged black holes. In particular, the boundary at\ninfinity is a timelike surface. This suggests the possibility of a dual quantum\nmechanical description. A five dimensional generalization is also discussed.\n", "  We study supersymmetry breaking by hidden-sector gaugino condensation in N=1\nD=4 supergravity models with multiple dilaton-like moduli fields. Our work is\nmotivated by Type I string theory, in which the low-energy effective Lagrangian\ncan have different dilaton-like fields coupling to different sectors of the\ntheory. We construct the effective Lagrangian for gaugino condensation and use\nit to compute the visible-sector gaugino masses. We find that the gaugino\nmasses can be of order the gravitino mass, in stark contrast to heterotic\nstring models with a single dilaton field.\n", "  D-instanton effects are studied for the IIB orientifold T^2/I\\Omega(-1)^{F_L}\nof Sen using type I/heterotic duality. An exact one loop threshold calculation\nof t_8 \\tr F^4 and t_8(\\tr F^2)^2 terms for the heterotic string on T^2 with\nWilson lines breaking SO(32) to SO(8)^4 is related to D-instanton induced terms\nin the worldvolume of D7 branes in the orientifold. Introducing D3 branes and\nusing the AdS/CFT correspondence in this case, these terms are used to\ncalculate Yang-Mills instanton contributions to four point functions of the\nlarge N_c limit of N=2 USp(2N_c) SYM with four fundamental and one\nantisymmetric tensor hypermultiplets.\n", "  We consider domain walls embedded in curved backgrounds as an approximation\nfor braneworld scenarios. We give a large class of new exact solutions,\nexhausting the possibilities for describing one and two walls for the cases\nwhere the curvature of both the bulk and the wall is locally constant. In the\ncase of two walls, we find solutions where each wall has positive tension. An\ninteresting property of these solutions is that the curvature of the walls can\nbe much smaller than the tension, leading to a significant cancellation of the\neffective cosmological constant, which however is still much larger than the\nobservational limits. We further discuss some aspects of inflation in models\nbased on wall solutions.\n", "  Recently it has been suggested by S. Carlip that black hole entropy can be\nderived from a central charge of the Virasoro algebra arising as a subalgebra\nin the surface deformations of General Relativity in any dimension. Here it is\nshown that the argumentation given in Section 2 of hep-th/9812013 and based on\nthe Regge-Teitelboim approach is unsatisfactory. The functionals used are\nreally ``non-differentiable'' under required variations and also the standard\nPoisson brackets for these functionals are exactly zero so being unable to get\nany Virasoro algebra with a central charge. Nevertheless Carlip's calculations\nwill be correct if we admit another definition for the Poisson bracket. This\nnew Poisson bracket differs from the standard one in surface terms only and\nallows to work with ``non-differentiable'' functionals.\n", "  We present new analytic and numerical results for self-gravitating\nSU(2)-Higgs magnetic monopoles approaching the black hole threshold. Our\ninvestigation extends to large Higgs self-coupling, lambda, a regime heretofore\nunexplored. When lambda is small, the critical solution where a horizon first\nappears is extremal Reissner-Nordstrom outside the horizon but has a\nnonsingular interior. When lambda is large, the critical solution is an\nextremal black hole with non-Abelian hair and a mass less than the extremal\nReissner-Nordstrom value. The transition between these two regimes is\nreminiscent of a first-order phase transition. We analyze in detail the\napproach to these critical solutions as the Higgs expectation value is varied,\nand compare this analysis with the numerical results.\n", "  Classical 1/4 BPS configurations consist of 1/2 BPS dyons which are\npositioned by competing static forces from electromagnetic and Higgs sectors.\nThese forces do not follow the simple inverse square law, but can be encoded in\nsome low energy effective potential between fundamental monopoles of distinct\ntypes. In this paper, we find this potential, by comparing the exact 1/4 BPS\nbound from a Yang-Mills field theory with its counterpart derived from low\nenergy effective dynamics of monopoles. Our method is generalized to arbitrary\ngauge groups and to arbitrary BPS monopole/dyon configurations. The resulting\neffective action for 1/4 BPS states is written explicitly, and shown to be\ndetermined entirely by the geometry of multi-monopole moduli spaces. We also\nexplore its natural supersymmetric extension.\n", "  We consider bosonic strings propagating on Euclidean adS_3, and study in\nparticular the realization of various worldsheet symmetries. We give a proper\ndefinition for the Brown-Henneaux asymptotic target space symmetry, when acting\non the string action, and derive the Giveon-Kutasov-Seiberg worldsheet contour\nintegral representation simply by using Noether's theorem. We show that making\nidentifications in the target space is equivalent to the insertion of an\n(exponentiated) graviton vertex operator carrying the corresponding charge.\nFinally, we point out an interesting relation between 3D gravity and the\ndynamics of the worldsheet on adS_3. Both theories are described by an\nSL(2,C)/SU(2) WZW model, and we prove that the reduction conditions determined\non one hand by worldsheet diffeomorphism invariance, and on the other by the\nBrown-Henneaux boundary conditions, are the same.\n", "  We study the dynamics of the probe fundamental string in the field background\nof the partially localized supergravity solution for the fundamental string\nending on Dp-brane. We separately analyze the probe dynamics for its motion\nalong the worldvolume direction and the transverse direction of the source\nDp-brane. We compare the dynamics of the probe along the Dp-brane worldvolume\ndirection to the BIon dynamics.\n", "  We compare oscillations of a fundamental string ending on a D3-brane in two\ndifferent settings: (1) a test-string radially threading the horizon of an\nextremal black D3-brane and (2) the spike soliton of the DBI effective action\nfor a D3-brane. Previous work has shown that overall transverse modes of the\ntest-string appear as l=0 modes of the transverse scalar fields of the DBI\nsystem. We identify DBI world-volume degrees of freedom that have dynamics\nmatching those of the test-string relative transverse modes. We show that there\nis a map, resembling T-duality, between relative and overall transverse modes\nfor the test-string that interchanges Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions\nand implies equality of the absorption coefficients for both modes. We give\ngeneral solutions to the overall and relative transverse parts of the DBI\ncoupled gauge and scalar system and calculate absorption coefficients for the\nhigher angular momentum modes in the low frequency limit. We find that there is\na nonzero amplitude for l>0 modes to travel out to infinity along the spike,\ndemonstrating that the spike remains effectively 3+1-dimensional.\n", "  Multi-trace scalar operators in the (0,k,0) representations of SU(4)_R share\nmany properties with their single-trace analogs. These multi-trace operators\nare primary fields of short representations of the N=4 superconformal group.\nThus, they have protected dimensions. We show that two- and three-point\ncorrelator functions of such operators do not receive radiative corrections at\norder g^2 in perturbation theory for an arbitrary gauge group.\n", "  The algebraic formulation of Large N matrix mechanics recently developed by\nHalpern and Schwartz leads to a practical method of numerical computation for\nboth action and Hamiltonian problems. The new technique posits a boundary\ncondition on the planar connected parts X_w, namely that they should decrease\nrapidly with increasing order. This leads to algebraic/variational schemes of\ncomputation which show remarkably rapid convergence in numerical tests on some\nmany- matrix models. The method allows the calculation of all moments of the\nground state, in a sequence of approximations, and excited states can be\ndetermined as well. There are two unexpected findings: a large d expansion and\na new selection rule for certain types of interaction.\n", "  The Casimir energy of an infinite compact cylinder placed in a uniform\nunbounded medium is investigated under the continuity condition for the light\nvelocity when crossing the interface. As a characteristic parameter in the\nproblem the ratio $\\xi^2=(\\epsilon_1-\\epsilon_2)^2/ (\\epsilon_1+\\epsilon_2)^-2\n= (\\mu_1-\\mu_2)^2/(\\mu_1+ \\mu_2)^2 \\le 1$ is used, where $\\epsilon_1$ and\n$\\mu_1$ are, respectively, the permittivity and permeability of the material\nmaking up the cylinder and $\\epsilon_2$ and $\\mu_2$ are those for the\nsurrounding medium. It is shown that the expansion of the Casimir energy in\npowers of this parameter begins with the term proportional to $\\xi^4$. The\nexplicit formulas permitting us to find numerically the Casimir energy for any\nfixed value of $\\xi^2$ are obtained. Unlike a compact ball with the same\nproperties of the materials, the Casimir forces in the problem under\nconsideration are attractive. The implication of the calculated Casimir energy\nin the flux tube model of confinement is briefly discussed.\n", "  We use the AdS/CFT duality to study the special point on the Coulomb branch\nof ${\\cal N}=4$ SU(N) gauge theory which corresponds to a spherically symmetric\nshell of D3-branes. This point is of interest both because the spacetime region\ninside the shell is flat, and because this configuration gives a very simple\nexample of the transition between D-branes in the perturbative string regime\nand the non-perturbative regime of black holes. We discuss how this geometry is\ndescribed in the dual gauge theory, through its effect on the two-point\nfunctions and Wilson loops. In the calculation of the two-point function, we\nstress the importance of absorption by the branes.\n", "  In this paper we sum over the spherical modes appearing in the expression for\nthe Casimir energy of a conducting sphere and of a dielectric ball (assuming\nthe same speed of light inside and outside), before doing the frequency\nintegration. We derive closed integral expressions that allow the calculations\nto be done to all orders, without the use of regularization procedures. The\ntechnique of mode summation using a contour integral is critically examined.\n", "  Motivated by recent remarks on the Delta+ mass and comparisons between the\nquark model and relations based on large-N_c with perturbative flavor breaking,\ntwo sets of Delta masses consistent with these constraints are constructed.\nThese two sets, based either on an experimentally determined mass splitting or\na quark model of isospin symmetry breaking, are shown to be inconsistent. The\nmodel dependence of this inconsistency is examined, and suggestions for\nimproved experiments are made. An explicit quark model calculation and mass\nrelations based on the large-N_c limit with perturbative flavor breaking are\ncompared. The expected level of accuracy of such relations is realized in the\nquark model, except for mass relations spanning more than one SU(6)\nrepresentation. It is shown that the Delta0 and Delta++ pole masses and Delta0\n- Delta+ = (Delta- - Delta++)/3 about 1.5 MeV are more consistent with model\nexpectations than the analogous Breit-Wigner masses and their splittings.\n", "  The OS and PDS renormalization schemes for the effective field theory with\nnucleons and pions are investigated. We explain in detail how the\nrenormalization is implemented using local counterterms. Fits to the NN\nscattering data are performed in the 1S0 and 3S1 channels for different values\nof mu_R. An error analysis indicates that the range of the theory with\nperturbative pions is consistent with 500 MeV.\n", "  We study superfluidity in a model of massless fermions coupled to a massive\nscalar field through a Yukawa interaction. Gap equations for a condensate with\ntotal spin J=0 are solved in the mean-field approximation. For the Yukawa\ninteraction, the gaps for right- and left-handed fermions are equal in\nmagnitude and opposite in sign, so that condensation occurs in the J^P = 0^+\nchannel. At finite scalar mass, there are two different gaps for fermions of a\ngiven chirality, corresponding to condensation of particle pairs or of\nantiparticle pairs. These gaps become degenerate in the limit of infinite\nscalar mass.\n", "  We show that all proposed quantum bit commitment schemes are insecure because\nthe sender, Alice, can almost always cheat successfully by using an\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen type of attack and delaying her measurement until she\nopens her commitment.\n", "  We use the decoherent histories approach to quantum theory to derive the form\nof an effective theory describing the coupling of classical and quantum\nvariables. The derivation is carried out for a system consisting of a large\nparticle coupled to a small particle with the important additional feature that\nthe large particle is also coupled to a thermal environment producing the\ndecoherence necessary for classicality. The effective theory is obtained by\ntracing out both the environment and the small particle variables. It consists\nof a formula for the probabilities of a set of histories of the large particle,\nand depends on the dynamics and initial quantum state of the small particle. It\nhas the form of an almost classical particle coupled to a stochastic variable\nwhose probabilities are determined by a formula very similar to that given by\nquantum measurement theory for continuous measurements of the small particle's\nposition. The effective theory gives intuitively sensible answers when the\nsmall particle is in a superposition of localized states.\n", "  We investigate the idea that decoherence is connected with the storage of\ninformation about the decohering system somewhere in the universe. The known\nconnection between decoherence of histories and the existence of records is\nextended from the case of pure initial states to mixed states. Records may\nstill exist but are necessarily imperfect. We formulate an\ninformation-theoretic conjecture about decoherence due to an environment: the\nnumber of bits required to describe a set of decoherent histories is\napproximately equal to the number of bits of information thrown away to the\nenvironment in the coarse-graining process. This idea is verified in a simple\nmodel consisting of a particle coupled to an environment that can store only\none bit of information. We explore the decoherence and information storage in\nthe quantum Brownian motion model. It is shown that the variables that the\nenvironment naturally measures and stores information about are the Fourier\ncomponents of the function $x(t)$ (describing the particle trajectory). The\nrecords storing the information about the Fourier modes are the positions and\nmomenta of the environmental oscillators at the final time. Decoherence is\npossible even if there is only one oscillator in the environment. The\ninformation count of the histories and records in the environment add up\naccording to our conjecture. These results give quantitative content to the\nidea that decoherence is related to ``information lost''.\n"]}
