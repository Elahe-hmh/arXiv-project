Crystal perfection at the interface is\nexperimentally demonstrated to contribute to large spin mixing conductance. The\nspin mixing conductance is obtained to be $1.3\\times10^{18} \\rm{m^{-2}}$ at the\nwell-controlled Pt/YIG interface, which is close to a theoretical prediction.\n", "  We report here the structure and dielectric studies on a new lead free\n(1-x)BaTiO3-xBi(Mg1/2Zr1/2)O3 solid solution to explore the morphotropic phase\nboundary. The powder x-ray diffraction studies on (1-x)BaTiO3-xBi(Mg1/2Zr1/2)O3\nsolid solution suggests that structure is tetragonal (P4mm) for the composition\nwith x=0.05 and cubic for the composition with x=0.30 and 0.40. Morphotropic\nphase boundary is observed in the composition range 0.10<x<0.30, where phase\ncoexistence is observed and composition dependence of room temperature\npermittivity shows a peak. High temperature dielectric measurement for the\ncomposition with x=0.20 exhibits diffuse phase transition having peak\ntemperature around ~ 396 K at 10 kHz. The diffuseness parameter ({\\gamma}) was\nobtained to be 1.68 for composition with x=0.20.\n", "  The presence of two compatible Hamiltonian structures is known to be one of\nthe main, and the most natural, mechanisms of integrability. For every pair of\nHamiltonian structures, there are associated conservation laws (first\nintegrals). Another approach is to consider the second Hamiltonian structure on\nits own as a tensor conservation law. The latter is more intrinsic as compared\nto scalar conservation laws derived from it and, as a rule, it is \"simpler\".\nThus it is natural to ask: can the dynamics of a bi-Hamiltonian system be\nunderstood by studying its Hamiltonian pair, without studying the associated\nfirst integrals?\\par In this paper, the problem of stability of equilibria in\nbi-Hamiltonian systems is considered and it is shown that the conditions for\nnonlinear stability can be expressed in algebraic terms of linearization of the\nunderlying Poisson pencil. This is used to study stability of stationary\nrotations of a free multidimensional rigid body.\n", "  Photoproduction off protons of the $p\\pi^0\\eta$ three-body final state was\nstudied with the Crystal Barrel/TAPS detector at the electron stretcher\naccelerator ELSA at Bonn for incident energies from the $\\pi^0\\eta$ production\nthreshold up to 2.5\\,GeV. Differential cross sections and the total cross\nsection are presented. The use of linearly polarized photons gives access to\nthe polarization observables $\\Sigma$, $I^{s}$ and $I^{c}$, the latter two\ncharacterize beam asymmetries in case of three-body final states.\n$\\Delta(1232)\\eta$, $N(1535){1/2^-}\\pi$, and $p a_0(980)$ are the dominant\nisobars contributing to the reaction. The partial wave analysis confirms the\nexistence of some nucleon and $\\Delta$ resonances for which so far only fair\nevidence was reported. A large number of decay modes of known nucleon and\n$\\Delta$ resonances is presented. It is shown that detailed investigations of\ndecay branching ratios may provide a key to unravelling the structure of\nnucleon and $\\Delta$ resonances.\n", "  The longitudinal spin-Seebeck effect (LSSE) has been investigated for\nPt/yttrium iron garnet (YIG) bilayer systems. The magnitude of the voltage\ninduced by the LSSE is found to be sensitive to the Pt/YIG interface condition.\nWe observed large LSSE voltage in a Pt/YIG system with a better crystalline\ninterface, while the voltage decays steeply when an amorphous layer is\nintroduced at the interface artificially.\n", "  We report the search results of muonic atoms from the STAR experiment at\nRHIC. The invariant mass distributions of hadron-muon pairs show peaks at the\nexpected atom masses. Two particle correlation functions indicate the hadrons\nand muons that are close in phase space are emitted at the same space time\npoint, which is a possible signature of muonic atom ionization at the beam\npipe. The pion-muon correlation functions are further decomposed into two\ncontributions, and the fraction of direct muons is obtained.\n", "  We give a survey of the two remarkable analytical problems of quantum\ninformation theory. The main part is a detailed report of the recent (partial)\nsolution of the quantum Gaussian optimizers problem which establishes an\noptimal property of Glauber's coherent states -- a particular instance of pure\nquantum Gaussian states. We elaborate on the notion of quantum Gaussian channel\nas a noncommutative generalization of Gaussian kernel to show that the coherent\nstates, and under certain conditions only they, minimize a broad class of the\nconcave functionals of the output of a Gaussian channel. Thus, the output\nstates corresponding to the Gaussian input are \"the least chaotic\", majorizing\nall the other outputs. The solution, however, is essentially restricted to the\ngauge-invariant case where a distinguished complex structure plays a special\nrole. We also comment on the related famous additivity conjecture, which was\nsolved in principle in the negative some five years ago. This refers to the\nadditivity or multiplicativity (with respect to tensor products of channels) of\ninformation quantities related to the classical capacity of quantum channel,\nsuch as $(1\\rightarrow p)$-norms or the minimal von Neumann or R\\'enyi output\nentropies. A remarkable corollary of the present solution of the quantum\nGaussian optimizers problem is that these additivity properties, while not\nvalid in general, do hold in the important and interesting class of the\ngauge-covariant Gaussian channels.\n", "  The experimental basis and theoretical background of non-Fourier heat\nconduction is shortly reviewed from the point of view of non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics. The performance of different theories is compared in case of\nheat pulse experiments.\n", "  Spin-current injection into an organic semiconductor\n$\\rm{\\kappa\\text{-}(BEDT\\text{-}TTF)_2Cu[N(CN)_2]Br}$ film induced by the spin\npumping from an yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film. When magnetization dynamics in\nthe YIG film is excited by ferromagnetic or spin-wave resonance, a voltage\nsignal was found to appear in the\n$\\rm{\\kappa\\text{-}(BEDT\\text{-}TTF)_2Cu[N(CN)_2]Br}$ film.\nMagnetic-field-angle dependence measurements indicate that the voltage signal\nis governed by the inverse spin Hall effect in\n$\\rm{\\kappa\\text{-}(BEDT\\text{-}TTF)_2Cu[N(CN)_2]Br}$. We found that the\nvoltage signal in the $\\rm{\\kappa\\text{-}(BEDT\\text{-}TTF)_2Cu[N(CN)_2]Br}$/YIG\nsystem is critically suppressed around 80 K, around which magnetic and/or glass\ntransitions occur, implying that the efficiency of the spin-current injection\nis suppressed by fluctuations which critically enhanced near the transitions.\n", "  Hall effects have been employed as sensitive detectors of magnetic fields and\nmagnetizations. In spintronics, exotic phenomena often emerge from a\nnon-equilibrium spin polarization or magnetization, that is very difficult to\nmeasure directly. The challenge is due to the tiny total moment, which is out\nof reach of superconducting quantum interference devices and vibrating sample\nmagnetometers or spectroscopic methods such as X-ray magnetic circular\ndichroism. The Kerr effect is sufficiently sensitive only in direct gap\nsemiconductors, in which the Kerr angle can be resonantly enhanced. Here we\ndemonstrate that even one excess spin in a million can be detected by a Hall\neffect at room temperature. The novel Hall effect is not governed by the spin\nHall conductivity but by its energy derivative thereby related to the spin\nNernst effect.\n", "  We study the temperature of extended objects in string theory. Rotating probe\nD-branes admit horizons and temperatures a la Unruh effect. We find that the\ninduced metrics on slow rotating probe D1-branes in holographic string\nsolutions including warped Calabi-Yau throats have distinct thermal horizons\nwith characteristic Hawking temperatures even if there is no black hole in the\nbulk Calabi-Yau. Taking the UV/IR limits of the solution, we show that the\nworld volume black hole nucleation depends on the deformation and the warping\nof the throat. We find that world volume horizons and temperatures of expected\nfeatures form not in the regular confining IR region but in the singular\nnonconfining UV solution. In the conformal limit of the UV, we find horizons\nand temperatures similar to those on rotating probes in the AdS throat found in\nthe literature. In this case, we also find that activating a background gauge\nfield form the U(1) R--symmetry modifies the induced metric with its\ntemperature describing two different classes of black hole solutions.\n", "  We report the observation of longitudinal spin Seebeck effects (LSSE) in an\nall-oxide bilayer system comprising an IrO$_2$ film and an Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$\nfilm. Spin currents generated by a temperature gradient across the\nIrO$_2$/Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ interface were detected as electric voltage via the\ninverse spin Hall effect in the conductive IrO$_2$ layer. This electric voltage\nis proportional to the magnitude of the temperature gradient and its magnetic\nfield dependence is well consistent with the characteristic of the LSSE. This\ndemonstration may lead to the realization of low-cost, stable, and transparent\nspin-current-driven thermoelectric devices.\n", "  The origin of microinertia of micromorphic theories is investigated from the\npoint of view of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In the framework of dual\ninternal variables microinertia stems from a thermodynamic equation of state\nrelated to the internal variable with the properties of mechanical momentum.\n", "  Electrons incident from a normal metal onto a superconductor are reflected\nback as holes - a process called Andreev reflection. In a normal metal where\nthe Fermi energy is much larger than a typical superconducting gap, the\nreflected hole retraces the path taken by the incident electron. In graphene\nwith ultra low disorder, however, the Fermi energy can be tuned to be smaller\nthan the superconducting gap. In this unusual limit, the holes are expected to\nbe reflected specularly at the superconductor-graphene interface due to the\nonset of interband Andreev processes, where the effective mass of the reflected\nholes change sign. Here we present measurements of gate modulated Andreev\nreflections across the low disorder van der Waals interface formed between\ngraphene and the superconducting NbSe2. We find that the conductance across the\ngraphene-superconductor interface exhibits a characteristic suppression when\nthe Fermi energy is tuned to values smaller than the superconducting gap, a\nhallmark for the transition between intraband retro- and interband specular-\nAndreev reflections.\n", "  Lorentz and CPT violation in the photon sector with the operators of\narbitrary mass dimension has been proposed in the context of Standard-Model\nExtension. The CPT-odd subset of this enlarged model is investigated from a\nquantum-field theoretical point of view. The generic forms of dispersion\nrelations, polarization vectors and the propagators are obtained for this\nspecial subset. Particularly, the general vacuum-orthogonal model is analyzed\nand it is demonstrated that the vacuum orthogonal model remains vacuum\northogonal at all orders. Although the model has birefringent solutions, they\nare shown to be spurious. Furthermore, the relevant polarization vectors are\nshown to be conventional. Leading order model is explicitly analyzed and it is\ndemonstrated that there exists a nontrivial coefficient space satisfying above\nproperties.\n", "  We study the local effects of an external time-dependent magnetic field on\naxion-like particles assuming they are all the dark matter of the universe. We\nfind that under suitable conditions the amplitude of the dark matter field can\nresonate parametrically. The resonance depends on the velocity of the\naxion-like particles and scales quadratically with the strength} of the\nexternal magnetic field, $\\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_{DM}} \\sim {B_0}^3$. By considering\ntypical experimental benchmark values, we find the resonance could amplify\naround two orders of magnitude the local energy density stored in the dark\nmatter condensate.\n", "  We investigate the general class of second-order PDEs, invariant under the\n$d=1$ $\\ell=\\frac{1}{2}+{\\mathbb N}_0$ centrally extended Conformal Galilei\nAlgebras, pointing out that they are deformations of decoupled systems. For\n$\\ell=\\frac{3}{2}$ the unique deformation parameter $\\gamma$ belongs to the\nfundamental domain $\\gamma\\in ]0,+\\infty[$. We show that, for any $\\gamma\\neq\n0$, invariant PDEs with discrete spectrum (either bounded or unbounded) induce\ncryptohermitian operators possessing the same spectrum as two decoupled\noscillators, provided that their frequencies are in the special ratio\n$r=\\frac{\\omega_2}{\\omega_1}=\\pm\\frac{1}{3},\\pm 3$ (the negative energy\nsolutions correspond to a special case of Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator), where\n$\\omega_1,\\omega_2$ are two different parameters of the invariant PDEs. We also\nconsider the $\\gamma=0$ decoupled system for any value $r$ of the ratio. It\npossesses enhanced symmetry at the critical values $r=\\pm \\frac{1}{3}, \\pm\n1,\\pm 3$. Two inequivalent $12$-generator symmetry algebras are found at $r\n=\\pm\\frac{1}{3},\\pm 3$ and $r=\\pm 1$, respectively. The $\\ell=\\frac{3}{2}$\nConformal Galilei Algebra is not a subalgebra of the decoupled symmetry\nalgebra. Its $\\gamma\\rightarrow 0$ contraction corresponds to a $8$-generator\nsubalgebra of the decoupled $r=\\pm\\frac{1}{3},\\pm 3$ symmetry algebra. The\nfeatures of the $\\ell\\geq \\frac{5}{2}$ invariant PDEs are briefly discussed.\n", "  Graphene and other two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising\nmaterials for broadband and ultrafast photodetection and optical modulation.\nThese optoelectronic capabilities can augment complementary\nmetal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices for high-speed and low-power optical\ninterconnects. Here, we demonstrate an on-chip ultrafast photodetector based on\na two-dimensional heterostructure consisting of high-quality graphene\nencapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. Coupled to the optical mode of a\nsilicon waveguide, this 2D heterostructure-based photodetector exhibits a\nmaximum responsivity of 0.36 A/W and high-speed operation with a 3 dB cut-off\nat 42 GHz. From photocurrent measurements as a function of the top-gate and\nsource-drain voltages, we conclude that the photoresponse is consistent with\nhot electron mediated effects. At moderate peak powers above 50 mW, we observe\na saturating photocurrent consistent with the mechanisms of electron-phonon\nsupercollision cooling. This nonlinear photoresponse enables optical on-chip\nautocorrelation measurements with picosecond-scale timing resolution and\nexceptionally low peak powers.\n", "  We propose versatile materials based on the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida\n(RKKY) interaction in a zigzag silicene nanoribbon (ZSNR) on half filling in\nthe presence of an out-of-plane electric field. We show that the topological\nphase transition in the band dispersion of ZSNR can be probed by using the RKKY\ninteraction. We find that, due to the zero-energy edge states of the ZSNR, the\nexchange coupling is significantly enhanced when the impurities are located on\nthe zigzag edges, and also explore that the strength of the interaction in the\ntopological insulator phase is much greater than that when the system is in the\nband insulator region. We present a model to investigate the phase of a system\nof two magnetic impurities located on the edge of the ZSNR and find that three\ndifferent magnetic phases, spiral, ferromagnetic, and anti-ferromagnetic, are\npossible for different values of the electric field. This electrical tunability\nof the magnetic phases in silicene can be explored by using current\nexperimental techniques and can be of interest in the field of spintronics.\n", "  We prove that in a certain asymptotic regime, solutions of the\nGross-Pitaevskii equation converge to solutions of the incompressible Euler\nequation, and solutions to the parabolic Ginzburg-Landau equations converge to\nsolutions of a limiting equation which we identify.\n  We work in the setting of the whole plane (and possibly the whole\nthree-dimensional space in the Gross-Pitaevskii case), in the asymptotic limit\nwhere $\\epsilon$, the characteristic lengthscale of the vortices, tends to $0$,\nand in a situation where the number of vortices $N$ blows up as $\\epsilon \\to\n0$. The requirements are that $N$ should blow up faster than $|\\log \\epsilon|$\nin the Gross-Pitaevskii case, and at most like $|\\log \\epsilon|$ in the\nparabolic case. Both results assume a well-prepared initial condition and\nregularity of the limiting initial data, and use the regularity of the solution\nto the limiting equation.\n  In the case of the parabolic Ginzburg-Landau equation, the limiting\nmean-field dynamical law that we identify coincides with the one proposed by\nChapman-Rubinstein-Schatzman and E in the regime $N\\ll |\\log \\epsilon|$, but\nnot if $N$ grows faster.\n", "  Since 2007, several contributions have tried to identify early-warning\nsignals of the financial crisis. However, the vast majority of analyses has\nfocused on financial systems and little theoretical work has been done on the\neconomic counterpart. In the present paper we fill this gap and employ the\ntheoretical tools of network theory to shed light on the response of world\ntrade to the financial crisis of 2007 and the economic recession of 2008-2009.\nWe have explored the evolution of the bipartite World Trade Web (WTW) across\nthe years 1995-2010, monitoring the behavior of the system both before and\nafter 2007. Our analysis shows early structural changes in the WTW topology:\nsince 2003, the WTW becomes increasingly compatible with the picture of a\nnetwork where correlations between countries and products are progressively\nlost. Moreover, the WTW structural modification can be considered as concluded\nin 2010, after a seemingly stationary phase of three years. We have also\nrefined our analysis by considering specific subsets of countries and products:\nthe most statistically significant early-warning signals are provided by the\nmost volatile macrosectors, especially when measured on developing countries,\nsuggesting the emerging economies as being the most sensitive ones to the\nglobal economic cycles.\n", "  The ekpyrotic phase (a slow contraction cosmic phase before the current\nexpansion phase) manages to solve the main problems of the standard cosmology\nby means of a scalar field interpreted as a cosmic fluid in the Friedmann\nequation. Moreover, this phase generates a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of\nperturbations in agreement with the latest data. Then, the ekpyrotic mechanism\nis a serious possibility to the inflationary model. In this work, by using the\napproach of deforming metrics at linear level, we point out that it is\nimpossible to generate a black hole with spherical symmetry supported by an\nisotropic fluid in this cosmological scenario.\n", "  We present a numerical study of the Hubbard model on simply stacked honeycomb\nand square lattices, motivated by a recent experimental realization of such\nmodels with ultracold atoms in optical lattices. We perform simulations with\ndifferent interlayer coupling and interaction strengths and obtain N\\'eel\ntransition temperatures and entropies. We provide data for the equation of\nstate to enable comparisons of experiments and theory. We find an enhancement\nof the short-range correlations in the anisotropic lattices compared to the\nisotropic cubic lattice, in parameter regimes suitable for the interaction\ndriven adiabatic cooling.\n", "  We study the relationship between singularities of finite-dimensional\nintegrable systems and singularities of the corresponding spectral curves. For\nthe large class of integrable systems on matrix polynomials, which is a general\nframework for various multidimensional spinning tops, as well as Beauville\nsystems, we prove that if the spectral curve is nodal, then all singularities\non the corresponding fiber of the system are non-degenerate. We also show that\nthe type of a non-degenerate singularity can be read off from the behavior of\ndouble points on the spectral curve under an appropriately defined\nantiholomorphic involution. Our analysis is based on linearization of\nintegrable flows on generalized Jacobian varieties, as well as on the\npossibility to express the eigenvalues of an integrable vector field linearized\nat a singular point in terms of residues of certain meromorphic differentials.\n", "  In a model where Majorana neutrinos heavier than the electroweak scale couple\nto Standard Model Higgs bosons and leptons, we compute systematically thermal\ncorrections to the direct and indirect CP asymmetries in the Majorana neutrino\ndecays. These are key ingredients entering the equations that describe the\nthermodynamic evolution of the induced lepton-number asymmetry eventually\nleading to the baryon asymmetry in the universe. We compute the thermal\ncorrections in an effective field theory framework that assumes the temperature\nsmaller than the masses of the Majorana neutrinos and larger than the\nelectroweak scale, and we provide the leading corrections in an expansion of\nthe temperature over the mass. In this work, we consider the case of two\nMajorana neutrinos with nearly degenerate masses.\n", "  We construct the first smooth horizonless supergravity solutions that have\ntwo topologically-nontrivial three-cycles supported by flux, and that have the\nsame mass and charges as a non-extremal D1-D5-P black hole. Our configurations\nare solutions to six-dimensional ungauged supergravity coupled to a tensor\nmultiplet, and uplift to solutions of Type IIB supergravity. The solutions\nrepresent multi-center generalizations of the non-BPS solutions of Jejjala,\nMadden, Ross, and Titchener, which have over-rotating angular momenta. By\nadding an additional Gibbons-Hawking center, we succeed in lowering one of the\ntwo angular momenta below the cosmic censorship bound, and bringing the other\nvery close to this bound. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to\nconstruct multi-center horizonless solutions corresponding to non-extremal\nblack holes, and offer the prospect of ultimately establishing that\nfinite-temperature black holes have nontrivial structure at the horizon.\n", "  We investigate the formation of Cooper pairs, bound dimers and the\ndimer-dimer elastic scattering of ultra- cold dipolar Fermi molecules confined\nin a 2D optical lattice bilayer configuration. While the energy and their\nassociated bound states are determined in a variational way, the correlated\ntwo-molecule pair is addressed as in the original Cooper formulation. We\ndemonstrate that the 2D lattice confinement favors the formation of zero center\nmass momentum bound states. Regarding the Cooper pairs binding energy, this\ndepends on the molecule populations in each layer. Maximum binding energies\noccur for non-zero (zero) pair momentum when the Fermi system is polarized\n(unpolarized). We find an analytic expression for the dimer-dimer effective\ninteraction in the deep BEC regime. The present analysis represents a route for\naddressing the BCS-BEC crossover superfluidity in dipolar Fermi gases confined\nin 2D optical lattices within the current experimental panorama.\n", "  We carry out \"exotic gluings\" a la Carlotto-Schoen for asymptotically\nhyperbolic general relativistic initial data sets. In particular we obtain a\ndirect construction of non-trivial initial data sets which are exactly\nhyperbolic in large regions extending to conformal infinity.\n", "  In this paper we study a new class of inflation models which generalize the\nDirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) action with the addition of a nonminimal kinetic\ncoupling (NKC) term. We dubbed this model as the {\\it new DBI inflation model}.\nThe NKC term does not bring new dynamical degree of freedom, so the equations\nof motion remain of second order. However, with such a coupling, the action is\nno longer linear with respect to the Einstein curvature term ($R$ or\n$G^{\\mu\\nu}$), which leads to a correction term of $k^4$ in the perturbations.\nThe new DBI inflation model can be viewed as theories beyond Horndeski. Without\nviolating nearly scale-invariance, such a correction may lead to new effects on\nthe inflationary spectra that could be tested by future observations.\n", "  Using density-functional calculations, we show that electron or hole doped\ngraphene can strongly change the mobility of adsorbed atoms H and O.\nInterestingly, charge doping affects the diffusion of H and O in the opposite\nway, namely, electron doping increases/reduces while hole doping\nreduces/increases the diffusion barrier of H/O, respectively. Specifically, on\nneutral graphene the diffusion barriers of O and H are 0.74 and 1.01 eV, which\nare, upon a hole doping of $+5.9\\times10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, 0.90 and 0.77 eV, and\nupon an electron doping of $-5.9\\times10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, 0.38 and 1.36 eV,\nrespectively. This means, within the harmonic transition state theory, at room\ntemperature, the diffusion rate of O can be decreased or increased by 470 or\n2.2$\\times 10^7$ times, and that of H can be increased or decreased by $10^5$\nor $7\\times 10^7$ times, by that hole or electron doping level. The difference\nbetween the H and O cases is interpreted in terms of the difference in\ngeometric and bonding changes upon charge doping.\n", "  The present work deals with a combined test of the so-called Fractional\nAction Cosmology (FAC) on the example of a specific model obtained by the\nauthor earlier. In this model, the effective cosmological term is proportional\nto the Hubble parameter squared through the so-called kinematic induction. The\nreason of studying this cosmological model could be explained by its ability to\ndescribe two periods of accelerated expansion, that is in agreement with the\nrecent observations and the cosmological inflation paradigm. First of all, we\nput our model through the theoretical tests that gives a general conception of\nthe influence of the model parameters on its behavior. Then, we obtain some\nrestrictions on the principal parameters of the model, including the fractional\nindex, by means of the observational data. Finally, the cosmography parameters\nand the observational data compared to the theoretical predictions are\npresented both analytically and graphically.\n", "  We present a theoretical framework for understanding the wavefunctions and\nspectrum of an extensively studied paradigm for quasiperiodic systems, namely\nthe Fibonacci chain. Our analytical results, which are obtained in the limit of\nstrong modulation of the hopping amplitudes, are in good agreement with\npublished numerical data. In the perturbative limit, we show a new symmetry of\nwavefunctions under permutation of site and energy indices. We compute the\nwavefunction renormalization factors and from them deduce analytical\nexpressions for the fractal exponents corresponding to individual\nwavefunctions, as well as their global averages. The multifractality of\nwavefunctions is seen to appear at next-to-leading order in the ratio of the\nhopping amplitudes, $\\rho$. Exponents for the local spectral density are given,\nin extremely good accord with numerical calculations. Interestingly, our\nanalytical results for exponents are observed to describe the system rather\nwell even for values of $\\rho$ well outside the domain of applicability of\nperturbation theory.\n", "  We present a generalization of the effective field theory (EFT) formalism for\ndark energy and modified gravity models to include operators with higher order\nspatial derivatives. This allows the extension of the EFT framework to a wider\nclass of gravity theories such as Horava gravity. We present the corresponding\nextended action, both in the EFT and the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) formalism,\nand proceed to work out a convenient mapping between the two, providing a self\ncontained and general procedure to translate a given model of gravity into the\nEFT language at the basis of the Einstein-Boltzmann solver EFTCAMB. Putting\nthis mapping at work, we illustrate, for several interesting models of dark\nenergy and modified gravity, how to express them in the ADM notation and then\nmap them into the EFT formalism. We also provide for the first time, the full\nmapping of GLPV models into the EFT framework. We next perform a thorough\nanalysis of the physical stability of the generalized EFT action, in absence of\nmatter components. We work out viability conditions that correspond to the\nabsence of ghosts and modes that propagate with a negative speed of sound in\nthe scalar and tensor sector, as well as the absence of tachyonic modes in the\nscalar sector. Finally, we extend and generalize the phenomenological basis in\nterms of $\\alpha$-functions introduced to parametrize Horndeski models, to\ncover all theories with higher order spatial derivatives included in our\nextended action. We elaborate on the impact of the additional functions on\nphysical quantities, such as the kinetic term and the speeds of propagation for\nscalar and tensor modes.\n", "  Additional physics beyond standard hydrodynamics is needed to fully model the\nintracluster medium (ICM); however, as we move to more sophisticated models, it\nis important to consider the role of magnetic fields and the way the fluid\napproximation breaks down. This paper represents a first step towards\ndeveloping a self-consistent model of the ICM by characterizing the statistical\nproperties of magnetic fields in cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters.\nWe find that plasma conditions are largely homogeneous across a range of\ncluster masses and relaxation states. We also find that the magnetic field\nlength scales are resolution dependent and not based on any particular physical\nprocess. Energy transfer mechanisms and scales are also identified, and imply\nthe existence of small scale dynamo action. The scales of the small scale\ndynamo are resolution limited and driven by numerical resistivity and\nviscosity.\n", "  Superstrata are bound states in string theory that carry D1, D5, and momentum\ncharges, and whose supergravity descriptions are parameterized by arbitrary\nfunctions of (at least) two variables. In the D1-D5 CFT, typical three-charge\nstates reside in high-degree twisted sectors, and their momentum charge is\ncarried by modes that individually have fractional momentum. Understanding this\nmomentum fractionation holographically is crucial for understanding typical\nblack-hole microstates in this system. We use solution-generating techniques to\nadd momentum to a multi-wound supertube and thereby construct the first\nexamples of asymptotically-flat superstrata. The resulting supergravity\nsolutions are horizonless and smooth up to well-understood orbifold\nsingularities. Upon taking the AdS3 decoupling limit, our solutions are dual to\nCFT states with momentum fractionation. We give a precise proposal for these\ndual CFT states. Our construction establishes the very nontrivial fact that\nlarge classes of CFT states with momentum fractionation can be realized in the\nbulk as smooth horizonless supergravity solutions.\n", "  We develop a theory for the quantum circuit consisting of a superconducting\nloop interrupted by four Josephson junctions and pierced by a magnetic flux\n(either static or time-dependent). In addition to the similarity with the\ntypical three-junction flux qubit in the double-well regime, we demonstrate the\ndifference of the four-junction circuit from its three-junction analogue,\nincluding its advantages over the latter. Moreover, the four-junction circuit\nin the single-well regime is also investigated. Our theory provides a tool to\nexplore the physical properties of this four-junction superconducting circuit.\n", "  An axiomatic approach to electrodynamics reveals that Maxwell electrodynamics\nis just one instance of a variety of theories for which the name\nelectrodynamics is justified. They all have in common that their fundamental\ninput are Maxwell's equations $\\textrm{d} F = 0$ (or $F = \\textrm{d} A$) and\n$\\textrm{d} H = J$ and a constitutive law $H = # F$ which relates the field\nstrength two-form $F$ and the excitation two-form $H$. A local and linear\nconstitutive law defines what is called local and linear pre-metric\nelectrodynamics whose best known application are the effective description of\nelectrodynamics inside media including, e.g., birefringence. We analyze the\nclassical theory of the electromagnetic potential $A$ before we use methods\nfamiliar from mathematical quantum field theory in curved spacetimes to\nquantize it in a locally covariant way. Our analysis of the classical theory\ncontains the derivation of retarded and advanced propagators, the analysis of\nthe causal structure on the basis of the constitutive law (instead of a metric)\nand a discussion of the classical phase space. This classical analysis sets the\nstage for the construction of the quantum field algebra and quantum states.\nHere one sees, among other things, that a microlocal spectrum condition can be\nformulated in this more general setting.\n", "  We present a novel approach to the classification of conformally equivariant\ndifferential operators on spinors in the case of homogeneous conformal\ngeometry. It is based on the classification of solutions for a vector-valued\nsystem of partial differential equations, associated to $\\mathcal{D}$-modules\nfor the homogeneous conformal structure and controlled by the spin Howe duality\nfor the orthogonal Lie algebras.\n", "  A search for anomalous pseudoscalar couplings of the Higgs boson H to\nelectroweak vector bosons V (= W or Z) in a sample of proton-proton collision\nevents corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 18.9 inverse femtobarns at\na center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV is presented. Events consistent with the\ntopology of associated VH production, where the Higgs boson decays to a pair of\nbottom quarks and the vector boson decays leptonically, are analyzed. The\nconsistency of data with a potential pseudoscalar contribution to the HVV\ninteraction, expressed by the effective pseudoscalar cross section fractions\nf[a3], is assessed by means of profile likelihood scans. Results are given for\nthe VH channels alone and for a combined analysis of the VH and previously\npublished H to VV channels. Under certain assumptions, f[a3](ZZ) > 0.0034 is\nexcluded at 95% confidence level in the combination. Scenarios in which these\nassumptions are relaxed are also considered.\n", "  Antibranes provide some of the most generic ways to uplift Anti-de Sitter\nflux compactifications to de Sitter, and there is a growing body of evidence\nthat antibranes placed in long warped throats such as the Klebanov-Strassler\nwarped deformed conifold solution have a brane-brane-repelling tachyon. This\ntachyon was first found in the regime of parameters in which the backreaction\nof the antibranes is large, and its existence was inferred from a highly\nnontrivial cancellation of certain terms in the inter-brane potential. We use a\nbrane effective action approach, similar to that proposed by Michel, Mintun,\nPolchinski, Puhm and Saad in arXiv:1412.5702, to analyze antibranes in\nKlebanov-Strassler when their backreaction is small, and find a regime of\nparameters where all perturbative contributions to the action can be computed\nexplicitly. We find that the cancellation found at strong coupling is also\npresent in the weak-coupling regime, and we establish its existence to all\nloops. Our calculation indicates that the spectrum of the antibrane worldvolume\ntheory is not gapped, and may generically have a tachyon. Hence uplifting\nmechanisms involving antibranes remain questionable even when backreaction is\nsmall.\n", "  A reformulation of inflationary model analyses appeared recently, in which\ninflationary observables are determined by the structure of a pole in the\ninflaton kinetic term rather than the shape of the inflaton potential. We\ncomprehensively study this framework with an arbitrary order of the pole taking\ninto account possible additional poles in the kinetic term or in the potential.\nDepending on the setup, the canonical potential becomes the form of hilltop or\nplateau models, variants of natural inflation, power-law inflation, or\nmonomial/polynomial chaotic inflation. We demonstrate attractor behaviors of\nthese models and compute corrections from the additional poles to the\ninflationary observables.\n", "  In multiple scientific and technological applications we face the problem of\nhaving low dimensional data to be justified by a linear model defined in a high\ndimensional parameter space. The difference in dimensionality makes the problem\nill-defined: the model is consistent with the data for many values of its\nparameters. The objective is to find the probability distribution of parameter\nvalues consistent with the data, a problem that can be cast as the exploration\nof a high dimensional convex polytope. In this work we introduce a novel\nalgorithm to solve this problem efficiently. It provides results that are\nstatistically indistinguishable from currently used numerical techniques while\nits running time scales linearly with the system size. We show that the\nalgorithm performs robustly in many abstract and practical applications. As\nworking examples we simulate the effects of restricting reaction fluxes on the\nspace of feasible phenotypes of a {\\em genome} scale E. Coli metabolic network\nand infer the traffic flow between origin and destination nodes in a real\ncommunication network.\n", "  A new alternative volume operator is constructed for loop quantum gravity by\nusing the so-called cotriad operators as building blocks. It is shown that the\nnew volume operator shares the same qualitative properties with the standard\nvolume operator. Moreover, a new alternative inverse volume operator is also\nconstructed in the light of the construction of the alternative volume\noperator, which is possessed of the same qualitative properties as those of the\nalternative volume operator. The new inverse volume operator can be employed to\nconstruct the Hamiltonian operator of matter fields, which may lead to an\nanomaly-free on-shell quantum constraint algebra without any special\nrestriction on the regularization procedure for gravity coupled to matter\nfields.\n", "  We present a universal characterization scheme for chimera states applicable\nto both numerical and experimental data sets. The scheme is based on two\ncorrelation measures that enable a meaningful definition of chimera states as\nwell as their classification into three categories: stationary, turbulent and\nbreathing. In addition, these categories can be further subdivided according to\nthe time-stationarity of these two measures. We demonstrate that this approach\nboth is consistent with previously recognized chimera states and enables us to\nclassify states as chimeras which have not been categorized as such before.\nFurthermore, the scheme allows for a qualitative and quantitative comparison of\nexperimental chimeras with chimeras obtained through numerical simulations.\n", "  We analyse the performance of two quantum-state-transfer Hamiltonians in the\npresence of diagonal and off-diagonal disorder, and in terms of different\nmeasures. The first Hamiltonian pertains to a fully-engineered chain and the\nsecond to a chain with modified boundary couplings. The task is to find which\nHamiltonian is the most robust to given levels of disorder and irrespective of\nthe input state. In this respect, it is shown that the performance of the two\nprotocols are approximately equivalent.\n", "  We consider quantum point contacts (QPCs) defined within disordered\ntwo-dimensional electron gases as studied by scanning gate microscopy. We\nevaluate the conductance maps in the Landauer approach and wave function\npicture of electron transport for samples with both low and high electron\nmobility at finite temperatures. We discuss the spatial distribution of the\nimpurities in the context of the branched electron flow. We reproduce the\nsurprising temperature stability of the experimental interference fringes far\nfrom the QPC. Next, we discuss -- previously undescribed -- funnel-shaped\nfeatures that accompany splitting of the branches visible in previous\nexperiments. Finally, we study elliptical interference fringes formed by an\ninterplay of scattering by the point-like impurities and by the scanning probe.\nWe discuss the details of the elliptical features as functions of the tip\nvoltage and the temperature, showing that the first interference fringe is very\nrobust against the thermal widening of the Fermi level. We present a simple\nanalytical model that allows for extraction of the impurity positions and the\nelectron gas depletion radius induced by the negatively charged tip of the\natomic force microscope, and apply this model on experimental scanning gate\nimages showing such elliptical fringes.\n", "  In the preceeding paper, introducing isospin-dependent density operators and\ndefining exact momenta (collective variables), we could get an exact\ncanonically momenta approach to a one-dimensional (1D) neutron-proton (NP)\nsystem. In this paper, we attempt at a velocity operator approach to a 3D NP\nsystem. Following Sunakawa, after introducing momentum density operators, we\ndefine velocity operators, denoting classical fluid velocities. We derive a\ncollective Hamiltonian in terms of the collective variables.\n", "  Critical properties of a liquid film between two planar walls are\ninvestigated in the canonical ensemble, within which the total number of\nparticles, rather than their chemical potential, is kept constant. The effect\nof this constraint is analyzed within mean field theory (MFT) based on a\nGinzburg-Landau free energy functional as well as via Monte Carlo simulations\nof the 3D Ising model with fixed total magnetization. Within MFT and for finite\nadsorption strengths at the walls, the thermodynamic properties of the film in\nthe canonical ensemble can be mapped exactly onto a grand canonical ensemble in\nwhich the corresponding chemical potential plays the role of the Lagrange\nmultiplier associated with the constraint. However, due to a non-integrable\ndivergence of the mean field order parameter profile near a wall, the limit of\ninfinitely strong adsorption turns out to be not well-defined within MFT,\nbecause it would necessarily violate the constraint. The critical Casimir force\n(CCF) acting on the two planar walls of the film is generally found to behave\ndifferently in the canonical and grand canonical ensembles. For instance, the\ncanonical CCF in the presence of equal preferential adsorption at the two walls\nis found to have the opposite sign and a slower decay behavior as a function of\nthe film thickness compared to its grand canonical counterpart. We derive the\nstress tensor in the canonical ensemble and find that it has the same\nexpression as in the grand canonical case, but with the chemical potential\nplaying the role of the Lagrange multiplier associated with the constraint. The\ndifferent behavior of the CCF in the two ensembles is rationalized within MFT\nby showing that, for a prescribed value of the thermodynamic control parameter\nof the film, i.e., density or chemical potential, the film pressures are\nidentical in the two ensembles, while the corresponding bulk pressures are not.\n", "  Azimuthal correlations of charged hadrons with direct-photon ($\\gamma_{dir}$)\nand neutral-pion ($\\pi^{0}$) trigger particles are analyzed in central Au+Au\nand minimum-bias $p+p$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{NN}}} = 200$ GeV in the STAR\nexperiment. The charged-hadron per-trigger yields at mid-rapidity from central\nAu+Au collisions are compared with $p+p$ collisions to quantify the suppression\nin Au+Au collisions. The suppression of the away-side associated-particle\nyields per $\\gamma_{dir}$ trigger is independent of the transverse momentum of\nthe trigger particle ($p_{T}^{\\mathrm{trig}}$), whereas the suppression is\nsmaller at low transverse momentum of the associated charged hadrons\n($p_{T}^{\\mathrm{assoc}}$). Within uncertainty, similar levels of suppression\nare observed for $\\gamma_{dir}$ and $\\pi^{0}$ triggers as a function of $z_{T}$\n($\\equiv p_T^{\\mathrm{assoc}}/p_T^{\\mathrm{trig}}$). The results are compared\nwith energy-loss-inspired theoretical model predictions. Our studies support\nprevious conclusions that the lost energy reappears predominantly at low\ntransverse momentum, regardless of the trigger energy.\n", "  We harness non-volatile, amorphous-crystalline transitions in the\nchalcogenide phase-change medium germanium antimony telluride (GST) to realize\noptically-switchable, all-dielectric metamaterials. Nanostructured,\nsubwavelength-thickness films of GST present high-quality resonances that are\nspectrally shifted by laser-induced structural transitions, providing\nreflectivity and transmission switching contrast ratios of up to 5:1 (7 dB) at\nvisible/near-infrared wavelengths selected by design.\n", "  Proton and alpha particle collisional transport coefficients (isotropization,\nrelative deceleration frequencies and heating rates) at 1 AU are quantified\nusing the WIND/SWE data. In agreement with previous studies the ion-ion Coulomb\ncollisions are generally important for slow solar wind streams and tend to\nreduce the temperature anisotropies, the differential streaming and the\ndifferences between proton and alpha particle temperatures. In slow solar wind\nstreams the Coulomb collisions between protons and alpha particles are\nimportant for the overall proton energetics as well as for the relative\ndeceleration between the two species. It is also shown that ion temperature\nanisotropies and differential streaming need to be generally taken into account\nfor evaluation of the collisional transport coefficients.\n", "  Whether the progenitors of SNe Ia are single-degenerate or double-degenerate\nwhite dwarf (WD) systems is a highly debated topic. To address the origin of\nthe Type Ia Tycho's supernova remnant (SNR), SN 1572, we have carried out a\n$^{12}$CO J=2-1 mapping and a 3-mm line survey toward the remnant using the\nIRAM 30 m telescope. We show that Tycho is surrounded by a clumpy molecular\nbubble at a local standard of rest velocity of $\\sim 61$ km s$^{-1}$ which\nexpands at a speed of $\\sim 4.5$ km s$^{-1}$ and has a mass of $\\sim 220$\nM$_\\odot$ (at the distance of 2.5 kpc). Enhanced $^{12}$CO J=2-1 line emission\nrelative to $^{12}$CO J=1-0 emission and possible line broadenings (in velocity\nrange $-64$ to $-60$ km s$^{-1}$) are found at the northeastern boundary of the\nSNR, where the shell is deformed and decelerated. These features, combined with\nthe morphological correspondence between the expanding molecular bubble and\nTycho, suggest that the SNR is associated with the bubble at the velocity range\n$-66$ to $-57$ km s$^{-1}$. The most plausible origin for the expanding bubble\nis the fast outflow (with velocity of hundreds km s$^{-1}$) driven from the\nvicinity of a WD as it accreted matter from a nondegenerate companion star. The\nSNR has been expanding in the low-density wind-blown bubble, and the shock wave\nhas just reached the molecular cavity wall. The SNR has been expanding in the\nlow-density wind-blown bubble, and the shock wave has just reached the\nmolecular cavity wall. This is the first unambiguous detection of an expanding\nbubble driven by the progenitor of a Type-Ia SNR, which constitutes evidence\nfor a single-degenerate progenitor for this SN Ia.\n", "  In cosmological $N$-body simulations, the representation of dark matter as\ndiscrete \"macroparticles\" suppresses the growth of structure, such that\nsimulations no longer reproduce linear theory on small scales near $k_{\\rm\nNyquist}$. Marcos et al. demonstrate that this is due to sparse sampling of\nmodes near $k_{\\rm Nyquist}$ and that the often-assumed continuum growing modes\nare not proper growing modes of the particle system. We develop initial\nconditions that respect the particle linear theory growing modes and then\nrescale the mode amplitudes to account for growth suppression. These ICs also\nallow us to take advantage of our very accurate $N$-body code Abacus to\nimplement 2LPT in configuration space. The combination of 2LPT and rescaling\nimproves the accuracy of the late-time power spectra, halo mass functions, and\nhalo clustering. In particular, we achieve 1% accuracy in the power spectrum\ndown to $k_{\\rm Nyquist}$, versus $k_{\\rm Nyquist}/4$ without rescaling or\n$k_{\\rm Nyquist}/13$ without 2LPT, relative to an oversampled reference\nsimulation. We anticipate that our 2LPT will be useful for large simulations\nwhere FFTs are expensive and that rescaling will be useful for suites of\nmedium-resolution simulations used in cosmic emulators and galaxy survey mock\ncatalogs. Code to generate initial conditions is available at\nhttps://github.com/lgarrison/zeldovich-PLT\n", "  Two essential methods, the symmetry analysis and of the singularity analysis,\nfor the study of the integrability of nonlinear ordinary differential equations\nare discussed. The main similarities and differences of these two different\nmethods are given.\n", "  The integrability of higher-order theories of gravity is of importance in the\ndetermining the properties of these models and so their viability as models of\nreality. An important tool in the establishment of integrability is the\nsingularity analysis. We apply this analysis to the case of fourth-order theory\nof gravity $f(R) = R + qR^{n}$ to establish those values of the free parameters\n$q$ and $n$ for which integrability in this sense exists. As a prelininary we\nexamine the well-known case of $n = 4/3$.\n", "  Notions of community quality underlie network clustering. While studies\nsurrounding network clustering are increasingly common, a precise understanding\nof the realtionship between different cluster quality metrics is unknown. In\nthis paper, we examine the relationship between stand-alone cluster quality\nmetrics and information recovery metrics through a rigorous analysis of four\nwidely-used network clustering algorithms -- Louvain, Infomap, label\npropagation, and smart local moving. We consider the stand-alone quality\nmetrics of modularity, conductance, and coverage, and we consider the\ninformation recovery metrics of adjusted Rand score, normalized mutual\ninformation, and a variant of normalized mutual information used in previous\nwork. Our study includes both synthetic graphs and empirical data sets of sizes\nvarying from 1,000 to 1,000,000 nodes.\n  We find significant differences among the results of the different cluster\nquality metrics. For example, clustering algorithms can return a value of 0.4\nout of 1 on modularity but score 0 out of 1 on information recovery. We find\nconductance, though imperfect, to be the stand-alone quality metric that best\nindicates performance on information recovery metrics. Our study shows that the\nvariant of normalized mutual information used in previous work cannot be\nassumed to differ only slightly from traditional normalized mutual information.\n  Smart local moving is the best performing algorithm in our study, but\ndiscrepancies between cluster evaluation metrics prevent us from declaring it\nabsolutely superior. Louvain performed better than Infomap in nearly all the\ntests in our study, contradicting the results of previous work in which Infomap\nwas superior to Louvain. We find that although label propagation performs\npoorly when clusters are less clearly defined, it scales efficiently and\naccurately to large graphs with well-defined clusters.\n", "  We construct a global B-model for weighted homogeneous polynomials based on\nK. Saito's theory of primitive forms. Our main motivation is to give a rigorous\nstatement of the so called global mirror symmetry conjecture relating\nGromov-Witten invariants and Fan--Jarvis--Ruan--Witten invariants. Furthermore,\nour construction allows us to generalize the notion of a quasi-modular form and\nholomorphic anomaly equations. Finally, we prove the global mirror symmetry\nconjecture for the Fermat polynomials.\n", "  Childhood and graduate school at Ann Arbor Michigan prepared Bill for an\ninteresting and rewarding career in physics. Along the way came Carol and many\njoint discoveries with our many colleagues to whom we both owe this good life.\nThis summary of Bill's early work prior to their marriage and sabbatical in\nJapan is Part I, prepared for Bill's 80th Birthday celebration at the\nUniversity of Sheffield in July 2016.\n", "  Colloidal and other granular media experience a transition to rigidity known\nas jamming if the fill fraction is increased beyond a critical value. The\nresulting jammed structures are locally disordered, bear applied loads\ninhomogenously, possess the minimal number of contacts required for stability\nand elastic properties that scale differently with volume fraction to\ncrystalline media. Here the jamming transition is studied on a curved\nellipsoidal surface by computer simulation, where shape evolution leads to a\nreduction in area, crowding the particles and preventing further evolution of\nthe surface. The arrested structures can be unjammed and the surface further\nevolved iteratively, eventually leading to a rigid metric-jammed state that is\nstable with respect to motion of the particles and some specified space of\ndeformations of the manifold. The structures obtained are compared with those\nobtained in flat space; it is found that jammed states in curved geometries\nrequire fewer contacts per particle due to the nonlinearity of the surface\nconstraints. In addition, structures composed of soft particles are compressed\nabove the jamming point. It is observed that relatively well-ordered but\ngeometrically frustrated monodisperse packings share many signatures of\ndisordered bidisperse packings.\n", "  L1157, a molecular dark cloud with an embedded Class 0 protostar possessing a\nbipolar outflow, is an excellent source for studying shock chemistry, including\ngrain-surface chemistry prior to shocks, and post-shock, gas-phase processing.\nThe L1157-B1 and B2 positions experienced shocks at an estimated ~2000 and 4000\nyears ago, respectively. Prior to these shock events, temperatures were too low\nfor most complex organic molecules to undergo thermal desorption. Thus, the\nshocks should have liberated these molecules from the ice grain-surfaces en\nmasse, evidenced by prior observations of SiO and multiple grain mantle species\ncommonly associated with shocks. Grain species, such as OCS, CH3OH, and HNCO,\nall peak at different positions relative to species that are preferably formed\nin higher velocity shocks or repeatedly-shocked material, such as SiO and HCN.\nHere, we present high spatial resolution (~3\") maps of CH3OH, HNCO, HCN, and\nHCO+ in the southern portion of the outflow containing B1 and B2, as observed\nwith CARMA. The HNCO maps are the first interferometric observations of this\nspecies in L1157. The maps show distinct differences in the chemistry within\nthe various shocked regions in L1157B. This is further supported through\nconstraints of the molecular abundances using the non-LTE code RADEX (Van der\nTak et al. 2007). We find the east/west chemical differentiation in C2 may be\nexplained by the contrast of the shock's interaction with either cold, pristine\nmaterial or warm, previously-shocked gas, as seen in enhanced HCN abundances.\nIn addition, the enhancement of the HNCO abundance toward the the older shock,\nB2, suggests the importance of high-temperature O-chemistry in shocked regions.\n", "  Magnetic field (H) effects on a correlated electron system with the\nspin-state degree of freedom are examined. The effective Hamiltonian derived\nfrom the two-orbital Hubbard model is analyzed by the mean-field approximation.\nApplying H to the low-spin (LS) phase induces the excitonic insulating phase,\nas well as the spin-state ordered phase where the LS and high-spin (HS) states\nare ordered alternately. In the case where H is applied to the HS phase, a\nreentrant transition for the HS phase appears. A rich variety of the phase\ndiagrams are attributed to the spin-state degree of freedom and their\ncombinations in the wave function as well as in the real-space configuration.\n", "  The high field charge injection and transport properties in reinforced\nsilicone dielectrics were investigated by measuring the time-dependent space\ncharge distribution and the current under dc conditions up to the breakdown\nfield, and were compared with properties of other dielectric polymers. It is\nargued that the energy and spatial distribution of localized electronic states\nare crucial to determining these properties for polymer dielectrics. Tunneling\nto localized states likely dominates the charge injection process. A transient\ntransport regime arises due to the relaxation of charge carriers into deep\ntraps at the energy band tails, and is successfully verified by a Monte Carlo\nsimulation using the multiple-hopping model. The charge carrier mobility is\nfound to be highly heterogeneous due to non-uniform trapping. The slow moving\nelectron packet exhibits a negative field dependent drift velocity possibly due\nto the spatial disorder of traps.\n", "  We two had year-long research leaves in Japan, working together fulltime with\nseveral Japanese plus Tony De Groot back in Livermore and Harald Posch in\nVienna. We summarize a few of the high spots from that very productive year (\n1989-1990 ), followed by an additional fifteen years' work in Livermore, with\nextensive travel. Next came our retirement in Nevada in 2005, which has turned\nout to be a long-term working vacation. Carol narrates this part of our history\ntogether.\n", "  The quest to have both which-path knowledge and interference fringes in a\ndouble-slit experiment dates back to the inception of quantum mechanics (QM)\nand to the famous Einstein-Bohr debates. In this paper we propose and discuss\nan experiment able to spy on one photon's path with another photon. We modify\nthe quantum state inside the interferometer as opposed to the traditional\nphysical modification of the \"wave-like\" or \"particle-like\" experimental setup.\nWe are able to show that it is the ability to harvest or not which-path\ninformation that finally limits the visibility of the interference pattern and\nnot the \"wave-like\" or \"particle-like\" experimental setups. Remarkably, a full\n\"particle-like\" experimental setup is able to show interference fringes with\n100 % visibility if the quantum state is carefully engineered.\n", "  The morphology of young Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWN) is largely determined by\nthe properties of the wind injected by the pulsar. We have used a recent\nparametrization of the wind obtained from Force Free Electrodynamics\nsimulations of pulsar magnetospheres to simulate nebulae for different sets of\npulsar parameters. We performed axisymmetric Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics\nsimulations to test the morphology dependence of the nebula on the obliquity of\nthe pulsar and on the magnetization of the pulsar wind. We compare these\nsimulations to the morphology of the Vela and Crab PWN. We find that the\nmorphology of Vela can be reproduced qualitatively if the pulsar obliquity\nangle is alpha ~45deg and the magnetization of the wind is high (sigma_0 ~\n3.0). A morphology similar to the one of the Crab Nebula is only obtained for\nlow magnetization simulations with alpha >~ 45deg. Interestingly, we find that\nKelvin-Helmholtz instabilities produce small scale turbulences downstream of\nthe reverse shock of the pulsar wind.\n", "  Using ab initio calculations and special quasirandom structures, we have\ncharacterized the distribution of defect formation energy and migration barrier\nin Ni-based solid-solution alloys: Ni_{0.5}Co_{0.5}, Ni_{0.5}Fe_{0.5},\nNi_{0.8}Fe_{0.2} and Ni_{0.8}Cr_{0.2}. As defect formation energies depend\nsensitively on elemental chemical potential, we have developed a\ncomputationally efficient method for determining it which takes into account\nthe global composition and local short-range order. We find that Fe has the\nbiggest alloy effects for Ni among these four elements. Our results show that\nthe distribution of migration energies for vacancies and interstitial have a\nregion of overlap, which will facilitate the recombination between them.\n", "  The recent formulations of multi-region relaxed magnetohydrodynamics (MRxMHD)\nhave generalized the famous Woltjer-Taylor states by incorporating a collection\nof \"ideal barriers\" that prevent global relaxation, and flow. In this paper, we\ngeneralize MRxMHD with flow to include Hall effects (MRxHMHD), and thereby\nobtain the partially relaxed counterparts of the famous double Beltrami states\nas a special subset. The physical and mathematical consequences arising from\nthe introduction of the Hall term are also presented. We demonstrate that our\nresults (in the ideal MHD limit) constitute an important subset of ideal MHD\nequilibria, and we compare our approach against other variational principles\nproposed for deriving the partially relaxed states.\n", "  A new covariant generalization of Einstein's general relativity is developed\nwhich allows the existence of a term proportional to\n$T_{\\alpha\\beta}T^{\\alpha\\beta}$ in the action functional of the theory\n($T_{\\alpha\\beta}$ is the energy-momentum tensor). Consequently the relevant\nfield equations are different from general relativity only in the presence of\nmatter sources. In the case of a charged black hole, we find exact solutions\nfor the field equations. Applying this theory to a homogeneous and isotropic\nspace-time, we find that there is a maximum energy density $\\rho_{\\text{max}}$,\nand correspondingly a minimum length $a_{\\text{min}}$, at early universe. This\nmeans that there is a bounce at early times and this theory avoids the\nexistence of an early time singularity. Moreover we show that this theory\npossesses a true sequence of cosmological eras. Also, we argue that although in\nthe context of the standard cosmological model the cosmological constant\n$\\Lambda$ does not play any important role in the early times and becomes\nimportant only after the matter dominated era, in this theory the \"repulsive\"\nnature of the cosmological constant plays a crucial role at early times for\nresolving the singularity.\n", "  Fibers of bent-core liquid crystals present an internal structure of a rolled\nsmectic layer and can be used as optical waveguides. We used a\nfield-theoretical Monte Carlo simulation to analyze the internal configuration\nof such fibers as a function of the radial coordinate and to study their\nequilibrium sates. In contrast to previous studies, we analyzed the fully\nnonlinear model proposed in [Bailey et al., Phys. Rev. E, 2007, 75, 031701] and\nrevised in [P\\'erez-Ortiz et al., Phys. Rev. E, 2011, 84, 011701]. We found\nthat, due to the non-differentiable character of such model, the Euler-Lagrange\nequations are not able to find all equilibrium states. Our Monte Carlo\nprocedure identified both differentiable and non-differentiable equilibria and\nfirst order transitions between them. In all cases, the equilibrium states show\ninhomogenous configurations that display a boundary layer. This methodology can\nby applied to other models of liquid crystals that have more degrees of\nfreedom, including those with non-differentiable minima. The equilibrium\nstructures found can be used as inputs to model the transmission of light along\nthe liquid crystal fibers.\n", "  We investigate the conditions required for planet formation via gravitational\ninstability (GI) and protoplanetary disk (PPD) fragmentation around M-dwarfs.\nUsing a suite of 64 SPH simulations with $10^6$ particles, the parameter space\nof disk mass, temperature, and radius is explored, bracketing reasonable values\nbased on theory and observation. Our model consists of an equilibrium, gaseous,\nand locally isothermal disk orbiting a central star of mass $M_*=M_{sol}/3$.\nDisks with a minimum Toomre $Q$ of $Q_{min} \\lesssim 0.9$ will fragment and\nform gravitationally bound clumps. Some previous literature has found $Q_{min}\n< 1.3-1.5$ to be sufficient for fragmentation. Increasing disk height tends to\nstabilize disks, and when incorporated into $Q$ as $Q_{eff}\\propto\nQ(H/R)^\\alpha$ for $\\alpha=0.18$ is sufficient to predict fragmentation. Some\ndiscrepancies in the literature regarding $Q_{crit}$ may be due to different\nmethods of generating initial conditions (ICs). A series of 15 simulations\ndemonstrates that perturbing ICs slightly out of equilibrium can cause disks to\nfragment for higher $Q$. Our method for generating ICs is presented in detail.\nWe argue that GI likely plays a role in PPDs around M-dwarfs and that disk\nfragmentation at large radii is a plausible outcome for these disks.\n", "  We demonstrate direct measurements of the spin-orbit interaction and Land\\'e\ng factors in a semiconductor nanowire double quantum dot. The device is made\nfrom a single-crystal pure-phase InAs nanowire on top of an array of finger\ngates on a Si/SiO$_2$ substrate and the measurements are performed in the Pauli\nspin-blockade regime. It is found that the double quantum dot exhibits a large\nsinglet-triplet energy splitting of $\\Delta_{ST}\\sim 2.3$ meV, a strong\nspin-orbit interaction of $\\Delta_{SO}\\sim 140$ $\\mu$eV, and a large and\nstrongly level-dependent Land\\'e g factor of $\\sim 12.5$. These results imply\nthat single-crystal pure-phase InAs nanowires are desired semiconductor\nnanostructures for applications in quantum information technologies.\n", "  Superconductivity is observed with critical temperature $T_{c}$ = 2.0 K in\nself-flux-grown single crystals of $CaBi_{2}$. This material adopts the\n$ZrSi_{2}$ structure type with lattice parameters a = 4.696(1) $\\AA$, b =\n7.081(2) $\\AA$ and c = 4.611(1) $\\AA$. The crystals of $CaBi_{2}$ were studied\nby means of magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and electrical resistivity\nmeasurements. The heat capacity jump at $T_{c}$ is $\\Delta C/\\gamma T_{c}$ =\n1.41, confirming bulk superconductivity; the Sommerfeld coefficient $\\gamma$ =\n4.1 $mJ\\: mol^{-1}\\, K^{-2}$ and the Debye temperature $\\Theta_{D}$ = 157 K.\nThe electron-phonon coupling strength is $\\lambda_{el-ph}$ = 0.59, and the\nthermodynamic critical field $H_{c}$ is low, between 111 and 124 Oe $CaBi_{2}$\nis a moderate coupling type-I superconductor. Results of electronic structure\ncalculations are reported and charge densities, electronic bands, densities of\nstates and Fermi surfaces are discussed, focusing on the effects of\nspin\\textendash orbit coupling and electronic property anisotropy. We find a\nmixed quasi-2D + 3D character in the electronic structure, which reflects the\nlayered crystal structure of the material.\n", "  In this note, we address the beam performance (particle content, rates) with\nemphasis on the momentum determination and particle identification methods for\nthe new H2-VLE (Very Low Energy) beam line that will serve the double phase\nProtoDUNE experiment (also known as WA105), in the framework of the CENF\nproject. The proposed instrumentation is configured to achieve an optimal\npi/K/proton separation over the full spectrum of provided beam energies, from\n0.4 GeV up to 12 GeV, as well as precise momentum measurement to a percent\nlevel, if required by the experiment. This note focuses on the H2-VLE beam line\nfor the Double Phase ProtoDUNE experiment, however the same approach can be\nimplemented for the H4-VLE beam, since the design of the two beam lines is very\nsimilar.\n", "  We present the identification of 634 variable stars in the Milky Way dSph\nsatellite Sculptor based on archival ground-based optical observations spanning\n$\\sim$24 years and covering $\\sim$ 2.5 deg$^2$. We employed the same\nmethodologies as the \"Homogeneous Photometry\" series published by Stetson. In\nparticular, we have identified and characterized one of the largest (536) RR\nLyrae samples so far in a Milky Way dSph satellite. We have also detected four\nAnomalous Cepheids, 23 SX Phoenicis stars, five eclipsing binaries, three field\nvariable stars, three peculiar variable stars located above the horizontal\nbranch - near to the locus of BL Herculis - that we are unable to classify\nproperly. Additionally we identify 37 Long Period Variables plus 23 probable\nvariable stars, for which the current data do not allow us to determine the\nperiod. We report positions and finding charts for all the variable stars, and\nbasic properties (period, amplitude, mean magnitude) and light curves for 574\nof them. We discuss the properties of the RR Lyrae stars in the Bailey diagram,\nwhich supports the coexistence of subpopulations with different chemical\ncompositions. We estimate the mean mass of Anomalous Cepheids\n($\\sim$1.5M$_{\\odot}$) and SX Phoenicis stars ($\\sim$1M$_{\\odot}$). We discuss\nin detail the nature of the former. The connections between the properties of\nthe different families of variable stars are discussed in the context of the\nstar formation history of the Sculptor dSph galaxy.\n", "  Tolerance implies enduring trying circumstances with a fair and objective\nattitude. To determine whether evolutionary advantages might be stemming from\ndiverse levels of tolerance in a population, we study a spatial public goods\ngame, where in addition to cooperators, defectors, and loners, tolerant players\nare also present. Depending on the number of defectors within a group, a\ntolerant player can either cooperate in or abstain from a particular instance\nof the game. We show that the diversity of tolerance can give rise to\nsynergistic effects, wherein players with a different threshold in terms of the\ntolerated number of defectors in a group compete most effectively against\ndefection and default abstinence. Such synergistic associations can stabilise\nstates of full cooperation where otherwise defection would dominate. We observe\ncomplex pattern formation that gives rise to an intricate phase diagram, where\ninvisible yet stable strategy alliances require outmost care lest they are\noverlooked. Our results highlight the delicate importance of diversity and\ntolerance for the provisioning of public goods, and they reveal fascinating\nsubtleties of the spatiotemporal dynamics that is due to the competition of\nsubsystem solutions in structured populations.\n", "  Superflares are flares that release total energy 10$\\sim$10$^{4}$ times\ngreater than that of the biggest solar flares with energy of $\\sim$10$^{32}$\nerg. We searched superflares on solar-type stars (G-type main sequence stars)\nusing the Kepler 30-min (long) and 1-min (short) cadence data. We found more\nthan 1500 superflares on 279 stars from 30-min cadence data (Q0-6) and 187\nsuperflares on 23 stars from 1-min cadence data (Q0-17). The bolometric energy\nof detected superflares ranges from the order of 10$^{32}$ erg to 10$^{36}$\nerg. Using these data, we found that the occurrence frequency ($dN/dE$) of\nsuperflares is expressed as a power-law function of flare energy ($E$) with the\nindex of -1.5 for $10^{33}<E<10^{36}$erg. Most of the superflare stars show\nquasi-periodic light variations with the amplitude of a few percent, which can\nbe explained by the rotation of the star with large starspots. The bolometric\nenergy released by flares is consistent with the magnetic energy stored around\nsuch large starspots. Furthermore, our analyses indicate that the occurrence\nfrequency of superflares depends on the rotation period, and that the flare\nfrequency increases as the rotation period decreases. However, the energy of\nthe largest flares observed in a given period bin does not show any clear\ncorrelation with the rotation period. We also found that the duration of\nsuperflares increases with the flare energy as $E^{0.39+/-0.03}$. This can be\nexplained if we assume the time-scale of flares is determined by the\nAlfv$\\acute{\\rm{e}}$n time.\n", "  Background: The nuclear symmetry energy is a fundamental ingredient in\ndetermining the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars (NS). Recent\nterrestrial experiments constrain both its value and slope at nuclear\nsaturation density, however, its value at higher densities is unknown. Assuming\na Free Fermi-gas (FFG) model for the kinetic symmetry energy, the high-density\nextrapolation depends on a single parameter, the density dependence of the\npotential symmetry energy. The Correlated Fermi-gas (CFG) model improves on the\nFFG model by including the effects of short-range, correlated, high-momentum,\nnucleons in nuclear matter. Using the CFG model for the kinetic symmetry energy\nalong with constraints from terrestrial measurements leads to a much softer\ndensity dependence for the potential symmetry energy. Purpose: Examine the\nability of the FFG and CFG models to describe NS observables that are directly\nsensitive to the symmetry energy at high-density. Specifically, examine the\nability of the CFG model, with its softer density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy, to describe a two solar-mass NS. Methods: Using a Bayesian\nanalysis of NS observables we compare the CFG and FFG models and examine the\nresulting parameters in the NS EOS and the density dependence of the potential\nsymmetry energy. Results: Despite the large difference in the density\ndependence of the potential part of the symmetry energy, both models can\ndescribe the NS data and support a two solar-mass NS. The different density\ndependences has only a small effect on the NS EOS. Conclusions: While sensitive\nto the high-density values of the symmetry energy, NS observables alone are not\nenough to distinguish between the CFG and FFG models. This indicates that the\nNS EOS, obtain from Bayesian analysis of NS observables, is robust and is not\nsensitive to the exact nuclear model used for the kinetic symmetry energy.\n", "  Fast 3D super-resolution imaging is essential for decoding rapidly occurring\nbiological processes. Encoding single molecules to their respective planes\nenable simultaneous multi-plane super-resolution volume imaging. This saves the\ndata-acquisition time and as a consequence reduce radiation-dose that lead to\nphotobleaching and other undesirable photochemical reactions. Detection and\nsubsequent identification of the locus of individual molecule (both on the\nfocal plane and off-focal planes) holds the key. Experimentally, this is\nachieved by accurate calibration of system PSF size and its natural spread in\noff-focal planes using sub-diffraction fluorescent beads. Subsequently the\nidentification and sorting of single molecules that belong to different axial\nplanes is carried out (by setting multiple cut-offs to respective PSFs).\nSimultaneous Multiplane Imaging based Localization Encoded (SMILE) microscopy\ntechnique eliminates the need for multiple z-plane scanning and thereby\nprovides a truly simultaneous multiplane super-resolution imaging.\n", "  The density-wave theory of galactic spiral-arm structure makes a striking\nprediction that the pitch angle of spiral arms should vary with the wavelength\nof the galaxy's image. The reason is that stars are born in the density wave\nbut move out of it as they age. They move ahead of the density wave inside the\nco-rotation radius, and fall behind outside of it, resulting in a tighter pitch\nangle at wavelengths that image stars (optical and near-infrared) than those\nthat are associated with star formation (far-infrared and ultraviolet). In this\nstudy we combined large sample size with wide range of wavelengths, from the\nultraviolet to the infrared to investigate this issue. For each galaxy we used\nan optical wavelength image (B-band: 445 nm) and images from the Spitzer Space\nTelescope at two infrared wavelengths (infrared: 3.6 and 8.0 {\\mu}m) and we\nmeasured the pitch angle with the 2DFFT and Spirality codes. We find that the\nB-band and 3.6 {\\mu}m images have smaller pitch angles than the infrared 8.0\n{\\mu}m image in all cases, in agreement with the prediction of density-wave\ntheory. We also used images in the ultraviolet from Galaxy Evolution Explorer,\nwhose pitch angles agreed with the measurements made at 8 {\\mu}m.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) semimetals beyond graphene have been relatively\nunexplored in the atomically-thin limit. Here we introduce a facile growth\nmechanism for semimetallic WTe2 crystals, then fabricate few-layer test\nstructures while carefully avoiding degradation from exposure to air. Low-field\nelectrical measurements of 80 nm to 2 um long devices allow us to separate\nintrinsic and contact resistance, revealing metallic response in the thinnest\nencapsulated and stable WTe2 devices studied to date (3 to 20 layers thick).\nHigh-field electrical measurements and electro-thermal modeling demonstrate\nthat ultra-thin WTe2 can carry remarkably high current density (approaching 50\nMA/cm2, higher than most common interconnect metals) despite a very low thermal\nconductivity (of the order ~3 W/m/K). These results suggest several pathways\nfor air-stable technological viability of this layered semimetal.\n", "  The family of organometal trihalide perovskite (OTP), CH3NH3PbX3 (where X is\nhalogen) has recently revolutionized the photovoltaics field and shows promise\nin a variety of optoelectronic applications. The characteristic spin properties\nof charge and neutral excitations in OTPs are influenced by the large\nspin-orbit coupling of the Pb atoms, which may lead to spin-based device\napplications. Here we report the first studies of pure spin-current and\nspin-aligned carrier injection in OTP spintronics devices using spin-pumping\nand spin-injection, respectively. We measure a relatively large\ninverse-spin-Hall effect using pulsed microwave excitation in OTP devices at\nresonance with a ferromagnetic substrate, from which we derive room temperature\nspin diffusion length, lambda_sd~9nm; and low-temperature giant\nmagnetoresistance in OTP-based spin-valves from which we estimate\nlambda_sd~85nm.\n", "  The rapid cost growth of flagship space missions has created a crisis for\nastronomy and planetary science. We have hit the funding wall. For the past 3\ndecades scientists have not had to think much about how space technology would\nchange within their planning horizon. However, this time around enormous\nimprovements in space infrastructure capabilities and, especially, costs are\nlikely on the 20-year gestation periods for large space telescopes. Commercial\nspace will lower launch and spacecraft costs substantially, enable\ncost-effective on-orbit servicing, cheap lunar landers and interplanetary\ncubesats by the early 2020s. A doubling of flagship launch rates is not\nimplausible. On a longer timescale it will enable large structures to be\nassembled and constructed in space. These developments will change how we plan\nand design missions.\n", "  Three dimensional particle-in-cell laser-plasma simulation is an important\narea of computational physics. Solving state-of-the-art problems requires\nlarge-scale simulation on a supercomputer using specialized codes. A growing\ndemand in computational resources inspires research in improving efficiency and\nco-design for supercomputers based on many-core architectures. This paper\npresents first performance results of the particle-in-cell plasma simulation\ncode PICADOR on the recently introduced Knights Landing generation of Intel\nXeon Phi. A straightforward rebuilding of the code yields a 2.43 x speedup\ncompared to the previous Knights Corner generation. Further code optimization\nresults in an additional 1.89 x speedup. The optimization performed is\nbeneficial not only for Knights Landing, but also for high-end CPUs and Knights\nCorner. The optimized version achieves 100 GFLOPS double precision performance\non a Knights Landing device with the speedups of 2.35 x compared to a 14-core\nHaswell CPU and 3.47 x compared to a 61-core Knights Corner Xeon Phi.\n", "  The inverse-Compton X-ray emission model for supernovae has been well\nestablished to explain the X-ray properties of many supernovae for over 30\nyears. However, no observational case has yet been found to connect the X-rays\nwith the optical lights as they should be. Here, we report the discovery of a\nhard X-ray source that is associated with a Type II-b supernova. Simultaneous\nemission enhancements have been found in both the X-ray and optical light\ncurves twenty days after the supernova explosion. While the enhanced X-rays are\nlikely dominated by inverse-Compton scatterings of the supernova's lights from\nthe Type II-b secondary peak, we propose a scenario of a high-speed supernova\nejecta colliding with a low-density pre-supernova stellar wind that produces an\noptically thin and high-temperature electron gas for the Comptonization. The\ninferred stellar wind mass-loss rate is consistent with that of the supernova\nprogenitor candidate as a yellow supergiant detected by the Hubble Space\nTelescope, providing an independent proof for the progenitor. This is also new\nevidence of the inverse-Compton emission during the early phase of a supernova.\n", "  This volume contains the Proceedings of the 2016 Workshop on Semantic Spaces\nat the Intersection of NLP, Physics and Cognitive Science (SLPCS 2016), which\nwas held on the 11th of June at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, and was\nco-located with Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2016). Exploiting the common\nground provided by the concept of a vector space, the workshop brought together\nresearchers working at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP),\ncognitive science, and physics, offering them an appropriate forum for\npresenting their uniquely motivated work and ideas. The interplay between these\nthree disciplines inspired theoretically motivated approaches to the\nunderstanding of how word meanings interact with each other in sentences and\ndiscourse, how diagrammatic reasoning depicts and simplifies this interaction,\nhow language models are determined by input from the world, and how word and\nsentence meanings interact logically. This first edition of the workshop\nconsisted of three invited talks from distinguished speakers (Hans Briegel,\nPeter G\\\"ardenfors, Dominic Widdows) and eight presentations of selected\ncontributed papers. Each submission was refereed by at least three members of\nthe Programme Committee, who delivered detailed and insightful comments and\nsuggestions.\n", "  Due to off-center relativistic motion of the charged spectators and the local\nmomentum-imbalance of the participants, a short-lived huge magnetic field is\nlikely generated, especially in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In\ndetermining the temperature dependence of bulk and shear viscosities of the QCD\nmatter in vanishing and finite magnetic field, we utilize mean field\napproximation to the SU($3$) Polyakov linear-sigma model (PLSM). We compare\nbetween the results from two different approaches; Green-Kubo correlation and\nBoltzmann master equation with Chapman-Enskog expansion. We find that both\napproaches have almost identical results, especially in the hadron phase. In\nthe temperature dependence of bulk and shear viscosities relative to thermal\nentropy at the critical temperature, there is a rapid decrease in the chiral\nphase-transition and in the critical temperature with increasing magnetic\nfield. As the magnetic field strength increases, a peak appears at the critical\ntemperature ($T_c$). This can be understood from the small drop on the thermal\nentropy at $T_c$, which can be interpreted due to instability in the\nhydrodynamic flow of the quark-gluon plasma and soft statistical hadronization.\nIt is obvious that, increasing magnetic field accelerates the transition from\nhadron to QGP phases (inverse catalysis), i.e., taking place at lower\ntemperatures.\n", "  II UMa is a late F-type (F5) contact binary with a close-in tertiary and a\ndistant visual companion. According to the four-color ($B$ $V$ $R_c$ $I_c$)\nlight curves' solutions of II UMa, it is a high fill-out (f=$86.6\\,\\%$) and low\nmass ratio ($q = 0.172$) contact binary system, which indicate that it is at\nthe late evolutionary stage of late-type tidal-locked binary stars. The mass of\nthe primary star and secondary one are calculated to be $M_1 = 1.99M_\\odot$,\n$M_2 = 0.34M_\\odot$. The primary star has evolved from ZAMS, but it is still\nbefore TAMS, and the secondary star is even more evolved. Considering the mass\nratio ($M_3/M_1 = 0.67$) obtained by spectroscopic observations, the mass of\nthe close-in tertiary is estimated to be $M_3 = 1.34M_\\odot$. The period\nvariations of the binary system is investigated for the first time. According\nto the observed-calculated ($O$-$C$) curve analysis, a continuous period\nincrease at a rate of $dP/dt=4.88\\times{10^{-7}}day\\cdot year^{-1}$ is\ndetermined. It may be just a part of a cyclic period change, or the\ncombinational period change of a parabolic variation and a cyclic one. More\ntimes of minimum light are needed to confirm this. The presence of the tertiary\ncomponent may play an important role in the formation and evolution of this\nbinary system by drawing angular momentum from the central system during the\npre-contact stage.\n", "  Temperature dependence of resistivity of single crystals of\nFe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Se and FeSe$_{1-y}$S$_y$ is studied in detail under zero and\nhigh magnetic field (magnetoresistance), the latter of which enables to monitor\nthe temperature ($T$) evolution of resistivity below the onset of\nsuperconducting transition temperature ($T_{\\rm c}$). In FeSe$_{1-y}$S$_y$,\n$T$-linear dependence of resistivity is prominent in $y$ = 0.160 below 40 K,\nwhereas it changes to a Fermi-liquid(FL)-like $T^2$ one below 10 K in $y$ =\n0.212. These suggest that the quantum critical point (QCP) originating from the\nelectronic nematicity resides around $y$ = 0.160 and the fluctuation in QCP\ngives rise anomalous $T$-linear dependence in resistivity in a wide $T$ range.\nIn Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Se, resistivity gradually changes from linear- to quadratic-\n$T$-dependent one at low temperatures in the range between $x$ = 0.036 and\n0.075. These could be interpreted by scenarios of both the nematic QCP and the\ncrossover in the ground states between the orthorhombic nematic phase and the\ntetragonal phase. The anomalies found as $T$-linear resistivity are discussed\nin terms of orbital and spin fluctuation arising from the nematic QCP.\n", "  We report the growth of thin films of the mixed valence compound YbAl$_{3}$\non MgO using molecular-beam epitaxy. Employing an aluminum buffer layer,\nepitaxial (001) films can be grown with sub-nm surface roughness. Using x-ray\ndiffraction, in situ low-energy electron diffraction and aberration-corrected\nscanning transmission electron microscopy we establish that the films are\nordered in the bulk as well as at the surface. Our films show a coherence\ntemperature of 37 K, comparable to that reported for bulk single crystals.\nPhotoelectron spectroscopy reveals contributions from both $\\textit{f}^{13}$\nand $\\textit{f}^{12}$ final states establishing that YbAl$_{3}$ is a mixed\nvalence compound and shows the presence of a Kondo Resonance peak near the\nFermi-level.\n", "  An asymmetric double-well potential is considered, assuming that the wells\nare parabolic around the minima. The WKB wave function of a given energy is\nconstructed inside the barrier between the wells. By matching the WKB function\nto the exact wave functions of the parabolic wells on both sides of the\nbarrier, for two almost degenerate states, we find a quantization condition for\nthe energy levels which reproduces the known energy splitting formula between\nthe two states. For the other low-lying non-degenerate states, we show that the\neigenfunction should be primarily localized in one of the wells with negligible\nmagnitude in the other. Using Dekker's method [Physica 146A (1987) 375], the\npresent analysis generalizes earlier results for weakly biased double-well\npotentials to systems with arbitrary asymmetry.\n", "  Two sets of light curves in $V$ $R_c$ $I_c$ bands for a newly discovered\nbinary system UCAC4 436-062932 are obtained and analyzed using the\nWilson-Devinney (W-D) code. The two sets of light curves get almost consistent\nresults. The determined mass ratio is about $q = 2.7$ and the less massive\ncomponent is nearly $250K$ hotter than the more massive one. The solutions\nconclude that UCAC4 436-062932 is a W-subtype shallow contact (with a contact\ndegree of $f = 20\\,\\%$) binary system. Since the O'Connell effect appears on\none set of the light curves, theories proposed to explain the effect are\ndiscussed. We assume that spot model may be the more plausible one to the\nO'Connell effect appeared on the asymmetric light curves of the binary system\nUCAC4 436-062932. Therefore, we add a cool spot on the surface of the more\nmassive star (component with lower effective temperature) and get a quite\napproving results for the light curve fitting. It will provide evidence to\nsupport the spot model in the explanatory mechanism of O'Connell effect.\n", "  The $B$ $V$ $R_c$ $I_c$ bands light curves of the newly discovered binary\nsystem \\astrobj{GSC 03122-02426} are obtained and analyzed using the\nWilson-Devinney (W-D) code. The solutions suggest that the mass ratio of the\nbinary system is $q = 2.70$ and the less massive component is $422K$ hotter\nthan the more massive one. We conclude that \\astrobj{GSC 03122-02426} is a\nW-subtype shallow contact (with a contact degree of $f = 15.3\\,\\%$) binary\nsystem. It may be a newly formed contact binary system which is just under\ngeometrical contact and will evolve to be a thermal contact binary system. The\nhigh orbital inclination ($i = 81.6^{\\circ}$) implies that \\astrobj{GSC\n03122-02426} is a total eclipsing binary system and the photometric parameters\nobtained by us are quite reliable. We also estimate the absolute physical\nparameters of the two components in \\astrobj{GSC 03122-02426}, which will\nprovide fundamental information for the research of contact binary systems. The\nformation and evolutionary scenario of \\astrobj{GSC 03122-02426} is discussed.\n", "  Electrically stimulated switching of a charge injection barrier at the\ninterface between an organic semiconductor and an electrode modified with a\ndisordered monolayer (DM) is studied by using various benzenethiol derivatives\nas DM molecules. The switching behavior is induced by a structural change in\nthe DM molecules, and is manifested as a reversible inversion of the polarity\nof DM-modified Au electrode/rubrene/DM-modified Au electrode diodes. The\nswitching direction is found to be dominantly determined by the push-back\neffect of the thiol bonding group, while the terminal group modulates the\nswitching strength. A device with 1,2-benzenedithiol DMs exhibited the highest\nswitching ratios of 20, 100, and 1000 for the switching voltages of 3, 5, and 7\nV, respectively. A variation in the tilt angle of benzenethiol DMs owing to the\napplication of 7 V is estimated to be smaller than 23.6 degrees by model\ncalculations. This study offers an understanding for obtaining highly stable\noperations of organic electronic devices, especially with molecular\nmodification layers.\n", "  The elastic wave propagation is investigated in the beam lattice material\ncharacterized by a square periodic cell with anti-tetrachiral microstructure.\nWith reference to the Floquet-Bloch spectrum, focus is made on the band\nstructure enrichments and modifications which can be achieved by equipping the\ncellular microstructure with tunable local resonators. By virtue of its\ncomposite mechanical nature, the so-built inertial meta-material gains enhanced\ncapacities of passive frequency-band filtering. Indeed the number, placement\nand properties of the inertial resonators can be designed to open, shift and\nenlarge the band gaps between one or more pairs of consecutive branches in the\nfrequency spectrum. In order to improve the meta-material performance, a\nnonlinear optimization problem is formulated. The maximum of the largest band\ngap amplitudes in the low-frequency range is selected as suited objective\nfunction. Proper inequality constraints are introduced to restrict the optimal\nsolutions within a compact set of mechanical and geometric parameters,\nincluding only physically realistic properties of both the lattice and\nresonators. The optimization problems related to full and partial band gaps are\nsolved independently, by means of a globally convergent version of the\nnumerical method of moving asymptotes, combined with a quasi-Monte Carlo\nmulti-start technique. The optimal solutions are discussed and compared from\nthe qualitative and quantitative viewpoints, bringing to light the limits and\npotential of the meta-material performance. The clearest trends emerging from\nthe numerical analyses are pointed out and interpreted from the physical\nviewpoint. Finally, some specific recommendations about the microstructural\ndesign of the meta-material are synthesized.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the analysis of effective thermomechanical\nproperties of multi- layered materials of interest for solid oxide fuel cells\n(SOFC) and lithium ions batteries fabrication. The recently developed\nasymptotic homogenization procedure is applied in order to express the overall\nthermoelastic constants of the first order equivalent continuum in terms of\nmicrofluctuations functions, and these functions are obtained by the solution\nof the corresponding recursive cell problems. The effects of thermal stresses\non periodic multi-layered thermoelastic composite reproducing the\ncharacteristics of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC-like) are studied assuming\nperiodic body forces and heat sources, and the solution derived by means of the\nasymptotic homogenization approach is compared with the results obtained by\nfinite elements analysis of the associate heterogeneous material.\n", "  We construct a family of bilinear differential operators which satisfy\ncertain gauge properties. These operators can be naturally associated with\n$q$-deformations of classical integrable hierarchies. In particular, we\nconsider the case when gauge function $=$ Hurwitz-type partition function.\n", "  We consider a gas of fermions at zero temperature and low density,\ninteracting via a microscopic two body potential which admits a bound state.\nThe particles are confined to a domain with Dirichlet (i.e. zero) boundary\nconditions. Starting from the microscopic BCS theory, we derive an effective\nmacroscopic Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) theory describing the condensate of fermion\npairs. The GP theory also has Dirichlet boundary conditions.\n  Along the way, we prove that the GP energy, defined with Dirichlet boundary\nconditions on a bounded Lipschitz domain, is continuous under interior and\nexterior approximations of that domain.\n", "  We present a systematic analysis of the energy gap in underdoped Bi2212\nsuperconductor as a function of temperature and hole doping level. Within the\nframework of the theoretical model containing the electron-phonon and\nelectron-electron-phonon pairing mechanism, we reproduced the measurement\nresults of modern ARPES experiments with very high accuracy. We showed that the\nenergy-gap amplitude is very weakly dependent on the temperature but clearly\ndependent on the level of doping. The evidence for a non-zero energy gap above\nthe critical temperature, referred to as a pseudogap, was also obtained.\n", "  We give emphasis on the use of chaos-based rigorous nonlinear technique\ncalled Visibility Graph Analysis, to study one economic time series - gold\nprice of USA. This method can offer reliable results with fiinite data. This\npaper reports the result of such an analysis on the times series depicting the\nfluctuation of gold price of USA for the span of 25 years(1990 - 2013). This\nanalysis reveals that a quantitative parameter from the theory can explain\nsatisfactorily the real life nature of fluctuation of gold price of USA and\nhence building a strong database in terms of a quantitative parameter which can\neventually be used for forecasting purpose.\n", "  Collision detection of a large number N of particles can be challenging.\nDirectly testing N particles for collision among each other leads to N 2\nqueries. Especially in scenarios, where fast, densely packed particles\ninteract, challenges arise for classical methods like Particle-in-Cell or\nMonte-Carlo. Modern collision detection methods utilising bounding volume\nhierarchies are suitable to overcome these challenges and allow a detailed\nanalysis of the interaction of large number of particles. This approach is\napplied to the analysis of the collision of two photon beams leading to the\ncreation of electron-positron pairs.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the initial value problem for the\nEinstein-Vlasov-Scalar field equations in temporal gauge, where the initial\ndata are prescribed on two characteristic smooth intersecting hypersurfaces.\nFrom a suitable choice of some free data, the initial data constraints's\nproblem is solved globally, then the evolution problem relative to the deduced\ninitial data is solved locally in time.\n", "  In itinerant ferromagnets, the quenched disorder is predicted to dramatically\naffect the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quantum phase transition driven by\nexternal control parameters at zero temperature. Here we report a study on\nFe-doped Cr$_2$B, which, starting from the paramagnetic parent, orders\nferromagnetically for Fe-doping concentrations $x$ larger than $x_{\\rm\nc}=2.5$\\%. In parent Cr$_2$B, $^{11}$B nuclear magnetic resonance data reveal\nthe presence of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic fluctuations. The\nlatter are suppressed with Fe-doping, before the ferromagnetic ones finally\nprevail for $x>x_{\\rm c}$. Indications for non-Fermi liquid behavior, usually\nassociated with the proximity of a quantum critical point, were found for all\nsamples, including undoped Cr$_2$B. The sharpness of the ferromagnetic-like\ntransition changes on moving away from $x_{\\rm c}$, indicating significant\nchanges in the nature of the magnetic transitions in the vicinity of the\nquantum critical point. Our data provide constraints for understanding quantum\nphase transitions in itinerant ferromagnets in the limit of weak quenched\ndisorder.\n", "  The Majorization Principle is a fundamental statement governing the dynamics\nof information processing in optimal and efficient quantum algorithms. While\nquantum computation can be modeled to be reversible, due to the unitary\nevolution undergone by the system, these quantum algorithms are conjectured to\nobey a quantum arrow of time dictated by the Majorization Principle: the\nprobability distribution associated to the outcomes gets ordered step-by-step\nuntil achieving the result of the computation. Here we report on the\nexperimental observation of the effects of the Majorization Principle for two\nquantum algorithms, namely the quantum fast Fourier transform and a recently\nintroduced validation protocol for the certification of genuine many-boson\ninterference. The demonstration has been performed by employing integrated 3-D\nphotonic circuits fabricated via femtosecond laser writing technique, which\nallows to monitor unambiguously the effects of majorization along the execution\nof the algorithms. The measured observables provide a strong indication that\nthe Majorization Principle holds true for this wide class of quantum\nalgorithms, thus paving the way for a general tool to design new optimal\nalgorithms with a quantum speedup.\n", "  Hydrogen adsorption on graphene-supported metal clusters has brought much\ncontroversy due to the complex nature of the bonding between hydrogen and metal\nclusters. The bond types of hydrogen and graphene-supported Ti clusters are\nexperimentally and theoretically investigated. Transmission electron microscopy\nshows that Ti clusters of nanometer-size are formed on graphene. Thermal\ndesorption spectroscopy captures three hydrogen desorption peaks from\nhydrogenated graphene-supported Ti clusters. First principle calculations also\nfound three types of interaction: Two types of bonds with different partial\nionic character and physisorption. The physical origin for this rests on the\ncharge state of the Ti clusters: when Ti clusters are neutral, H2 is\ndissociated, and H forms bonds with the Ti cluster. On the other hand, H2 is\nadsorbed in molecular form on positively charged Ti clusters, resulting in\nphysisorption. Thus, this work clarifies the bonding mechanisms of hydrogen on\ngraphene-supported Ti clusters.\n", "  Muon tomography is developing as a promising system to detect high-Z (atomic\nnumber) material for ensuring homeland security. In the present work, three\nkinds of spatial locations of materials which are made of aluminum, iron, lead\nand uranium are simulated with GEANT4 codes, which are horizontal, diagonal and\nvertical objects, respectively. Two statistical algorithms are used with MATLAB\nsoftware to reconstruct the image of detected objects, which are the Point of\nCloset Approach (PoCA) and Maximum Likelihood Scattering-Expectation\nMaximization iterative algorithm (MLS-EM), respectively. Two analysis methods\nare used to evaluate the quality of reconstruction image, which are the\nReceiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and the localization ROC (LROC) curves,\nrespectively. The reconstructed results show that, compared with PoCA\nalgorithm, MLS-EM can achieve a better image quality in both edge preserving\nand noise reduction. And according to the analysis of ROC (LROC) curves, it\nshows that MLS-EM algorithm can discriminate and exclude the presence and\nlocation of high-Z object with a high efficiency, which is more flexible with\nan different EM algorithm employed than prior work. Furthermore the MLS-EM\niterative algorithm will be modified and ran in parallel executive way for\nimproving the reconstruction speed.\n", "  Unlike the tensile mode, compressive deformation of a bcc metallic\nnanostructure is mediated by the glide of screw dislocation. Although the bcc\nscrew dislocations are well known to possess unusual attributes, it is still\nunclear how these unique effects manifest in a nanoscale solid. In the present\nstudy, atomistic simulations render a close look at the dislocation activities\nunderlying the compressive deformation of bcc iron nanopillars. It is found\nthat instead of performing simple glide motion, the line defects exhibit a host\nof complex features. In this regard, the temperature is observed to have a\npronounced effect on the dislocation mechanisms and consequently, on the\noverall plastic response of the material. Additionally, statistical features of\nthe load-strain data have been explored.\n", "  The olfactory system removes correlations in natural odors using a network of\ninhibitory neurons in the olfactory bulb. It has been proposed that this\nnetwork integrates the response from all olfactory receptors and inhibits them\nequally. However, how such global inhibition influences the neural\nrepresentations of odors is unclear. Here, we study a simple statistical model\nof this situation, which leads to concentration-invariant, sparse\nrepresentations of the odor composition. We show that the inhibition strength\ncan be tuned to obtain sparse representations that are still useful to\ndiscriminate odors that vary in relative concentration, size, and composition.\nThe model reveals two generic consequences of global inhibition: (i) odors with\nmany molecular species are more difficult to discriminate and (ii) receptor\narrays with heterogeneous sensitivities perform badly. Our work can thus help\nto understand how global inhibition shapes normalized odor representations for\nfurther processing in the brain.\n", "  The illustration of cosmic acceleration under two interacting dark energy\nmodels (pilgrim dark energy with Granda and Oliveros cutoff and its generalized\nghost version) in DGP braneworld framework is presented. In the current\nscenario, the equation of state parameter, deceleration parameter,\n$\\omega_{D}-\\omega'_{D}$ plane and statefinder diagnosis are investigated. The\nequation state parameter behave-like phantom era of the universe. The\ndeceleration parameter depicts the accelerated expansion of the universe in\nboth models. The cosmological planes like $\\omega_{D}-\\omega'_{D}$ and\nstatefinder corresponds to $\\Lambda$CDM limit. To end, we remark that our\nresults support to phenomenon of pilgrim dark energy and cosmic acceleration.\nAlso, the results are consistent with observational data.\n", "  New high resolution, optical spectroscopy of the high mass X-ray binary LMC\nX-3, shows the spectral type of the donor star changes with phase due to\nirradiation by the X-ray source. We find the spectral type is likely to be B5V,\nand only appears as B3V when viewing the heated side of the donor. Combining\nour measurements with those previously published, and taking into account the\neffects of X-ray irradiation, results in a value for the donor star radial\nvelocity semi-amplitude of 256.7 +/- 4.9 km/s. We find the mass of the black\nhole lies in the range 9.5 - 13.6 solar masses.\n", "  For a noncentrosymmetric superconductor such as Y$_2$C$_3$, we consider a\nparity-mixing model composed of spin-singlet s-wave and spin-triplet f-wave\npairing components.\n  The $d$-vector in f-wave state is chosen to be parallel to the Dresselhaus\nasymmetric spin-orbit coupling vector.\n  It is found that, the quasiparticle excitation spectrum exhibits distinct\nnodal structure as a consequence of parity-mixing. Our calculation predict\nanomalous noninteger power laws for low-temperature nuclear spin-lattice\nrelaxation rate $T_{1}^{-1}$.\n  We demonstrate particularly that such a model can qualitatively account for\nthe existing experimental results of the temperature dependence of $T_{1}^{-1}$\nin Y$_2$C$_3$.\n", "  We demonstrate an electrolyte-gated hybrid nanoparticle/organic synapstor\n(synapse-transistor, termed EGOS) that exhibits short-term plasticity as\nbiological synapses. The response of EGOS makes it suitable to be interfaced\nwith neurons: short-term plasticity is observed at spike voltage as low as 50\nmV (in a par with the amplitude of action potential in neurons) and with a\ntypical response time in the range of tens milliseconds. Human neuroblastoma\nstem cells are adhered and differentiated into neurons on top of EGOS. We\nobserve that the presence of the cells does not alter short-term plasticity of\nthe device.\n", "  The study of silicon (Si) isotopes in ocean island basalts (OIB) has the\npotential to discern between different models for the origins of geochemical\nheterogeneities in the mantle. Relatively large (several per mil per atomic\nmass unit) Si isotope fractionation occurs in low-temperature environments\nduring biochemical and geochemical precipitation of dissolved Si, where the\nprecipitate is preferentially enriched in the lighter isotopes relative to the\ndissolved Si. In contrast, only a limited range (tenths of a per mil) of Si\nisotope fractionation has been observed from high-temperature igneous\nprocesses. Therefore, Si isotopes may be useful as tracers for the presence of\ncrustal material within OIB mantle source regions that experienced relatively\nlow-temperature surface processes in a manner similar to other stable isotope\nsystems, such as oxygen. Characterizing the isotopic composition of the mantle\nis also of central importance to the use of the Si isotope system as a basis\nfor comparisons with other planetary bodies (e.g., Moon, Mars, asteroids).\n  Here we present the first comprehensive suite of high-precision Si isotope\ndata obtained by MC-ICP-MS for a diverse suite of OIB. Samples originate from\nocean islands in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean basins and include\nrepresentative end-members for the EM-1, EM-2, and HIMU mantle components. On\naverage, Si isotope compositions of OIB are in general agreement with previous\nestimates for the Si isotope composition of bulk silicate Earth. Nonetheless,\nsome small systematic variations are present; specifically, most HIMU-type\n(Mangaia; Cape Verde; La Palma, Canary Islands) and Iceland OIB are enriched in\nthe lighter isotopes of Si, consistent with recycled altered oceanic crust and\nlithospheric mantle in their mantle sources.\n", "  A survey of red giants in the globular cluster M3 with the Hydra multi-object\nspectrograph on the WIYN 3.5-m telescope indicated a prominent Li I 6707 $\\AA$\nfeature in the red giant vZ 1050. Follow-up spectroscopy with the ARC 3.5-m\ntelescope confirmed this observation and yielded a derived abundance of\nA(Li)$_{NLTE}$ = 1.6 $\\pm$ 0.05. In addition, the high oxygen and low sodium\nabundances measured from the same spectrum suggest that vZ 1050 is a first\ngeneration cluster star. The location vZ 1050 above the horizontal branch and\nblueward of the red giant branch in the cluster's color-magnitude diagram\nplaces vZ 1050 on M3's asymptotic giant branch. The likely source for the\nenhanced lithium abundance is the Cameron-Fowler mechanism operating in vZ 1050\nitself.\n", "  Optical vortices, as a kind of structured beam with helical phase wavefronts\nand doughnut shape intensity distribution, have been used for fabricating\nchiral structures in metal and spiral patterns in anisotropic\npolarization-dependent azobenzene polymer. However, in isotropic polymer, the\nfabricated microstructures are typically confined to non-chiral cylindrical\ngeometry due to two-dimensional doughnut intensity profile of optical vortices.\nHere we develop a powerful strategy for realizing chiral microstructures in\nisotropic material by coaxial interference of a vortex beam and a plane wave,\nwhich produces three-dimensional (3D) spiral optical fields. This coaxial\ninterference beams are creatively produced by designing the contrivable\nholograms consisting of azimuthal phase and equiphase loaded on liquid-crystal\nspatial light modulator. Then, in isotropic polymer, 3D chiral microstructures\nare achieved under illumination of the coaxial interference femtosecond laser\nbeams with their chirality controlled by the topological charge. Our further\ninvestigation reveals that the spiral lobes and chirality are caused by the\ninterfering patterns and helical phase wavefronts, respectively. This technique\nis simple, stable, and easy-operation, and offers broad applications in optical\ntweezers, optical communications and fast metamaterial fabrication.\n", "  The growth of brightest cluster galaxies is closely related to the properties\nof their host cluster. We present evidence for dry mergers as the dominant\nsource of BCG mass growth at $z\\lesssim1$ in the XXL 100 brightest cluster\nsample. We use the global red sequence, H$\\alpha$ emission and mean star\nformation history to show that BCGs in the sample possess star formation levels\ncomparable to field ellipticals of similar stellar mass and redshift. XXL 100\nbrightest clusters are less massive on average than those in other X-ray\nselected samples such as LoCuSS or HIFLUGCS. Few clusters in the sample display\nhigh central gas concentration, rendering inefficient the growth of BCGs via\nstar formation resulting from the accretion of cool gas. Using measures of the\nrelaxation state of their host clusters, we show that BCGs grow as relaxation\nproceeds. We find that the BCG stellar mass corresponds to a relatively\nconstant fraction 1\\%\\ of the total cluster mass in relaxed systems. We also\nshow that, following a cluster scale merger event, the BCG stellar mass lags\nbehind the expected value from the M$_{cluster}$ - M$_{BCG}$ relation but\nsubsequently accretes stellar mass via dry mergers as the BCG and cluster\nevolve towards a relaxed state.\n", "  During the solidification of Al-Sm metallic glasses the evolution of the\nsupercooled liquid atomic structure has been identified with an increasing\npopulation of icosahedral-like clusters with increasing Sm concentration. These\nclusters exhibit slower kinetics compared to the remaining clusters in the\nliquid leading to enhanced amorphous phase stability and glass forming ability\n(GFA). Maximum icosahedral-ordering and atomic packing density have been found\nfor the Al90Sm10 and Al85Sm15 alloys, respectively, whereas minimum cohesive\nenergy has been found for the Al93Sm7 which is consistent with the range of\ncompositions (from Al92Sm8 to Al84Sm16) found experimentally with high GFA.\n", "  A reversible logic has application in quantum computing. A reversible logic\ndesign needs resources such as ancilla and garbage qubits to reconfigure\ncircuit functions or gate functions. The removal of garbage qubits and ancilla\nqubits are essential in designing an efficient quantum circuit. In the\nliterature, there are multiple designs that have been proposed for a reversible\nmultiplication operation. A multiplication hardware is essential for the\ncircuit design of quantum algorithms, quantum cryptanalysis, and digital signal\nprocessing (DSP) applications. The existing designs of reversible quantum\ninteger multipliers suffer from redundant garbage qubits. In this work, we\npropose a reversible logic based, garbage-free and ancilla qubit optimized\ndesign of a quantum integer multiplier. The proposed quantum integer multiplier\nutilizes a novel add and rotate methodology that is specially suitable for a\nreversible computing paradigm. The proposed design methodology is the modified\nversion of a conventional shift and add method. The proposed design of the\nquantum integer multiplier incorporates add or no operation based on multiplier\nqubits and followed by a rotate right operation. The proposed design of the\nquantum integer multiplier produces zero garbage qubits and shows an\nimprovement ranging from 60% to 90% in ancilla qubits count over the existing\nwork on reversible quantum integer multipliers.\n", "  The organization of nano-particles inside grafted polymer layers is governed\nby the interplay of polymer-induced entropic interactions and the action of\nexternally applied fields. Earlier work had shown that strong external forces\ncan drive the formation of colloidal structures in polymer brushes. Here we\nshow that external fields are not essential to obtain such colloidal patterns:\nwe report Monte Carlo and Molecular dynamics simulations that demonstrate that\nordered structures can be achieved by compressing a `sandwich' of two grafted\npolymer layers, or by squeezing a coated nanotube, with nano-particles in\nbetween. We show that the pattern formation can be efficiently controlled by\nthe applied pressure, while the characteristic length--scale, i.e. the typical\nwidth of the patterns, is sensitive to the length of the polymers. Based on the\nresults of the simulations, we derive an approximate equation of state for\nnano-sandwiches.\n", "  Orbits of 55 visual binary stars are computed using recent speckle\ninterferometry data from the SOAR telescope: 33 first-time orbits and 22\nrevisions of previous orbit calculations. The orbital periods range from 1.4 to\n370 years, the quality of orbits ranges from definitive to preliminary and\ntentative. Most binaries consist of low-mass dwarfs and have short periods\n(median period 31 years). The dynamical parallaxes and masses are evaluated and\ncompared to the Hipparcos parallaxes. Using differential speckle photometry,\nbinary components are placed on the color-magnitude diagram.\n", "  Orbital elements of C2011 L4 (PanStarrs) Oort cloud comet, computed by MPC\n(Minor Planet Center, Minor Planet Electronic Circular 2012-T08), show that the\nclosest approach to the Sun occurred on 2013 March 10th, at about 0.3 A.U.,\nthen about 4,51x10^7 km. Discovered by Richard Wainscoat (Institute for\nAstronomy, University of Hawaii) on four CCD images taken with the 1.8-m\n\"Pan-STARRS 1\" telescope at Haleakala taken on 2011 June 6th. My first\nobservation of the comet was on 2013 March 10th whit the comet visible in the\ntwilight. I did the following visual estimation; Mar. 10.73,-1.0*,5'(T.\nScarmato, Calabria, Italy, 7x50 binoculars; altitude 7 deg, tail 1 deg in pa\n140 deg), reported to the ICQ (International Comet Quarterly). Easy comet in\n7x50 binoculars I started to see C/2011 L4 at 18:35 L.T. when the comet was at\nabout 7{\\deg} above the horizon. I saw a tail long about 1,5{\\deg} in pa\n140{\\deg} with a coma well condensed and large about 5'. I followed the comet\nuntil to the set at 18:55 L.T., still clearly visible at so low altitude about\n1{\\deg} or less! I don't saw Mars (1.39 mag) at the same altitude, so I\nesteemed the comet using Aldebaran (1.1 mag) at 62,44{\\deg} of altitude also\nusing the ICQ Table of Atmospheric Extinction; but remembering C/2006 P1 in the\nsame conditions of observation I could to assume that the comet was at negative\napparent total magnitude m1= -1.0. The image of the comet was impressive (see\nFig. 2). Here, I present my observations and results on the size of the\nnucleus, period of rotation, dust production and peculiar structures in the\ninner coma.\n  Key words: General: general; comets: C/2011 L4 (PanStarrs), PanStarrs,\ncomets, afrho, photometry of aperture, flux, apparent magnitude, absolute\nmagnitude; comet nucleus: size, rotation.\n", "  The ARGO--YBJ experiment has been in stable data taking for more than five\nyears at the Yangbajing cosmic ray observatory (Tibet, P.R. China, 4300 m\na.s.l.). The detector collected about $5\\times10^{11}$ events in a wide energy\nrange from few TeVs up to the PeV region. In this work we summarize the latest\nresults in cosmic ray physics particularly focusing on the cosmic ray energy\nspectrum. The results of the measurement of the all-particle and proton plus\nhelium energy spectra in the energy region between $10^{12} - 10^{16}$ eV are\ndiscussed. A precise measurement of the cosmic ray energy spectrum and\ncomposition in this energy region allows a better understanding of the origin\nof the knee and provides a powerful cross-check among different experimental\ntechniques.\n", "  We numericaly demonstrate that, in double well models, the autocorrelation\ntime of open path integral Monte Carlo simulations can be much smaller compared\nto standard ones using ring polymers. We also provide an intuitive explanation\nbased on the role of instantons as transition states of the path integral\npseudodynamics. Therefore we propose that, in all cases when the ground state\napproximation to the finite temperature partition function holds, open path\nintegral simulations can be used to accelerate the sampling in realistic\nsimulations aimed to explore nuclear quantum effects.\n", "  Ultrathin superconductors of different materials are becoming a powerful\nplatform to find mechanisms for enhancement of superconductivity, exploiting\nshape resonances in different superconducting properties. Here we evaluate the\nsuperconducting gap and its spatial profile, the multiple gap components, and\nthe chemical potential, of generic superconducting nanofilms, considering the\npairing attraction and its energy scale as tunable parameters, from weak to\nstrong coupling, at fixed electron density. Superconducting properties are\nevaluated at mean field level as a function of the thickness of the nanofilm,\nin order to characterize the shape resonances in the superconducting gap. We\nfind that the most pronounced shape resonances are generated for weakly coupled\nsuperconductors, while approaching the strong coupling regime the shape\nresonances are rounded by a mixing of the subbands due to the large energy gaps\nextending over large energy scales. Finally, we find that the spatial profile,\ntransverse to the nanofilm, of the superconducting gap acquires a flat behavior\nin the shape resonance region, indicating that a robust and uniform multigap\nsuperconducting state can arise at resonance.\n", "  The accretion of a terrestrial body and differentiation of its silicate/oxide\nmantle from iron core provide abundant energy for heating its interior to\ntemperatures much higher than the present day Earth. The consequences of\ndifferentiation on the structure and composition of planets are typically\naddressed considering only the interaction of molten iron with an immiscible\n`rocky' phase. We demonstrate that mixing in a representative system of liquid\nor solid MgO and liquid iron to a single homogeneous liquid occurs at\nsufficiently low temperature to be present in the aftermath of a giant impact.\nApplying the thermodynamic integration technique to density functional theory\nmolecular dynamics simulations, we determine the solvus closure temperature for\nthe Fe-MgO system for pressures up to 400 GPa. Solvus closure occurs at\n$\\sim$4000 K at low pressure, and has a weak positive pressure dependence, such\nthat its gradient with respect to depth is less steep than an adiabatic\ntemperature profile. This predicts a new mode of core-mantle differentiation\nfollowing the most energetic giant impacts, with exsolution of iron from the\nmixture beginning in the outer layers of the planet. We demonstrate that\nhigh-temperature equilibration results in delivery of nominally insoluble\nMg-rich material to the early core. Since MgO is the least soluble major mantle\ncomponent in iron at low temperatures, these results may represent an upper\nbound on temperature for mixing in terrestrial planets.\n", "  We study the universality class of the fixed points of the 2D random bond\nq-state Potts model by means of numerical transfer matrix methods. In\nparticular, we determine the critical exponents associated with the fixed point\non the Nishimori line. Precise measurements show that the universality class of\nthis fixed point is inconsistent with percolation on Potts clusters for q=2,\ncorresponding to the Ising model, and q=3\n"]}
