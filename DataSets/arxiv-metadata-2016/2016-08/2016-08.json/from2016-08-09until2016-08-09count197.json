White dwarf stars are the final evolutionary stage of the vast\nmajority of stars, including our Sun. The study of white dwarfs has potential\napplications to different fields of astrophysics. In particular, they can be\nused as independent reliable cosmic clocks, and can also provide valuable\ninformation about the fundamental parameters of a wide variety of stellar\npopulations, like our Galaxy and open and globular clusters. In addition, the\nhigh densities and temperatures characterizing white dwarfs allow to use these\nstars as cosmic laboratories for studying physical processes under extreme\nconditions that cannot be achieved in terrestrial laboratories. They can be\nused to constrain fundamental properties of elementary particles such as axions\nand neutrinos, and to study problems related to the variation of fundamental\nconstants.\n  In this work, we review the essentials of the physics of white dwarf stars.\nSpecial emphasis is placed on the physical processes that lead to the formation\nof white dwarfs as well as on the different energy sources and processes\nresponsible for chemical abundance changes that occur along their evolution.\nMoreover, in the course of their lives, white dwarfs cross different\npulsational instability strips. The existence of these instability strips\nprovides astronomers with an unique opportunity to peer into their internal\nstructure that would otherwise remain hidden from observers. We will show that\nthis allows to measure with unprecedented precision the stellar masses and to\ninfer their envelope thicknesses, to probe the core chemical stratification,\nand to detect rotation rates and magnetic fields. Consequently, in this work,\nwe also review the pulsational properties of white dwarfs and the most recent\napplications of white dwarf asteroseismology.\n", "  Integrated power and linewidth of a propagating and a self-localized spin\nwave modes excited by spin-polarized current in an obliquely magnetized\nmagnetic nanocontact are studied experimentally as functions of the angle\n$\\theta_e$ between the external bias magnetic field and the nanocontact plane.\nIt is found that the power of the propagating mode monotonically increases with\n$\\theta_e$, while the power of the self-localized mode has a broad maximum near\n$\\theta_e = 40$ deg, and exponentially vanishes near the critical angle\n$\\theta_e = 58$ deg, at which the localized mode disappears. The linewidth of\nthe propagating mode in the interval of angles $58<\\theta_e<90$ deg, where only\nthis mode is excited, is adequtely described by the existing theory, while in\nthe angular interval where both modes can exist the observed linewidth of both\nmodes is substantially broadened due to the telegraph switching between the\nmodes. Numetical simulations and an approximate analytical model give good\nsemi-quantitative description of the observed results.\n", "  The contribution of quarks with masses m >> Lambda_QCD is the only part of\nthe structure functions in deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) which is not yet\nknown at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) of perturbative QCD. We\npresent improved partial NNLO results for the most important structure function\nF_2(x,Q^2) near the partonic threshold, in the high-energy (small-x) limit and\nat high scales Q^2 >> m^2; and employ these results to construct approximations\nfor the gluon and quark coefficient functions which cover the full kinematic\nplane. The approximation uncertainties are carefully investigated, and found to\nbe large only at very small values, x smaller about 10^-3, of the Bjorken\nvariable.\n", "  We study a d-dimensional lattice model of diffusing coalescing massive\nparticles, with two parameters controlling deposition and evaporation of\nmonomers. The unique stationary distribution for the system exhibits a phase\ntransition in all dimensions d greater or equal to one between a growing phase,\nin which the expected mass is infinite at each site, and an exponential phase\nin which the expected mass is finite. We establish rigorous upper and lower\nbounds on the critical curve describing the phase transition for this system,\nand some asymptotics for large or small deposition rates.\n", "  The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is a general purpose detector, designed to\nrun at the highest luminosity at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Its\ndistinctive features include a 4 T superconducting solenoid with 6-m-diameter\nby 12.5-m-length free bore, enclosed inside a 10000-ton return yoke made of\nconstruction steel. The return yoke consists of five dodecagonal three-layered\nbarrel wheels and four end-cap disks at each end comprised of steel blocks up\nto 620 mm thick, which serve as the absorber plates of the muon detection\nsystem. Accurate characterization of the magnetic field everywhere in the CMS\ndetector is required. To measure the field in and around the steel, a system of\n22 flux-loops and 82 3-D Hall sensors is installed on the return yoke blocks.\nFast discharges of the solenoid (190 s time-constant) made during the CMS\nmagnet surface commissioning test at the solenoid central fields of 2.64, 3.16,\n3.68 and 4.01 T were used to induce voltages in the flux-loops. The voltages\nare measured on-line and integrated off-line to obtain the magnetic flux in the\nsteel yoke close to the muon chambers at full excitations of the solenoid. The\n3-D Hall sensors installed on the steel-air interfaces give supplementary\ninformation on the components of magnetic field and permit to estimate the\nremanent field in steel to be added to the magnetic flux density obtained by\nthe voltages integration. A TOSCA 3-D model of the CMS magnet is developed to\ndescribe the magnetic field everywhere outside the tracking volume measured\nwith the field-mapping machine. The results of the measurements and\ncalculations are presented, compared and discussed.\n", "  In the cosmic microwave background or galaxy density maps, missing\nfluctuations in masked regions can be reconstructed from fluctuations in the\nsurrounding unmasked regions if the original fluctuations are sufficiently\nsmooth. One reconstruction method involves applying a harmonic expansion\niteratively to fluctuations in the unmasked region. In this paper, we discuss\nhow well this reconstruction method can recover the original fluctuations\ndepending on the prior of fluctuations and property of the masked region. The\nreconstruction method is formulated with an asymptotic expansion in terms of\nthe size of mask for a fixed iteration number. The reconstruction accuracy\ndepends on the mask size, the spectrum of the underlying density fluctuations,\nthe scales of the fluctuations to be reconstructed and the number of\niterations. For Gaussian fluctuations with the Harrison--Zel'dovich spectrum,\nthe reconstruction method provides more accurate restoration than naive methods\nbased on brute--forth matrix inversion or the singular value decomposition. We\nalso demonstrate that an isotropic non-Gaussian prior does not change the\nresults but an anisotropic non-Gaussian prior can yield a higher reconstruction\naccuracy compared to the Gaussian prior case.\n", "  With the progress of nano-technology, thermodynamics also has to be scaled\ndown, calling for specific protocols to extract and measure work. Usually, such\nprotocols involve the action of an external, classical field (the battery) of\ninfinite energy, that controls the energy levels of a small quantum system (the\ncalorific fluid). Here we suggest a realistic device to reversibly extract work\nin a battery of finite energy : a hybrid optomechanical system. Such devices\nconsist in an optically active two-level quantum system interacting strongly\nwith a nano-mechanical oscillator that provides and stores mechanical work,\nplaying the role of the battery. We identify protocols where the battery\nexchanges large, measurable amounts of work with the quantum emitter without\ngetting entangled with it. When the quantum emitter is coupled to a thermal\nbath, we show that thermodynamic reversibility is attainable with\nstate-of-the-art devices, paving the road towards the realization of a full\ncycle of information-to-energy conversion at the single bit level.\n", "  This article investigates a new gauge theoretic approach to Einstein's\nequations in dimension 4. Whilst aspects of the formalism are already explained\nin various places in the mathematics and physics literature, our first goal is\nto give a single coherent account of the theory in purely mathematical\nlanguage. We then explain why the new approach may have important mathematical\napplications: the possibility of using the calculus of variations to find\nEinstein 4-manifolds, as well as links to symplectic topology. We also carry\nout some of the technical groundwork to attack these problems.\n", "  The extended flow equations of a new $Z_N$-Toda hierarchy which takes values\nin a commutative subalgebra $Z_N$ of $gl(N,\\mathbb C)$ is constructed.\nMeanwhile we give the Hirota bilinear equations and tau function of this new\nextended $Z_N$-Toda hierarchy(EZTH). Because of logarithm terms, some extended\nVertex operators are constructed in generalized Hirota bilinear equations which\nmight be useful in topological field theory and Gromov-Witten theory. Meanwhile\nthe Darboux transformation and bi-hamiltonian structure of this hierarchy are\ngiven. From hamiltonian tau symmetry, we give another different tau function of\nthis hierarchy with some unknown mysterious connections with the one defined\nfrom the point of Sato theory.\n", "  The photon-number distribution between two parts of a given volume is found\nfor an arbitrary photon statistics. This problem is related to the interaction\nof a light beam with a macroscopic device, for example a diaphragm, that\nseparates the photon flux into two parts with known probabilities. To solve\nthis problem, a Generalized Binomial Distribution (GBD) is derived that is\napplicable to an arbitrary photon statistics satisfying probability convolution\nequations. It is shown that if photons obey Poisson statistics then the GBD is\nreduced to the ordinary binomial distribution, whereas in the case of\nBose-Einstein statistics the GBD is reduced to the Polya distribution. In this\ncase, the photon spatial distribution depends on the phase-space volume\noccupied by the photons. This result involves a photon bunching effect, or\ncollective behavior of photons that sharply differs from the behavior of\nclassical particles. It is shown that the photon bunching effect looks similar\nto the quantum interference effect.\n", "  We study the problem of universal quantum cloning -- taking several identical\ncopies of a pure but unknown quantum state and producing further copies. While\nit is well known that it is impossible to perfectly reproduce the state, how\nwell the copies can be cloned can be quantified using the fidelity. We examine\nhow individual fidelities can be traded against each other, and how different\nfidelity measures can be incorporated. The broadly applicable formalism into\nwhich we transform the cloning problem is described as a series of quadratic\nconstraints which are amenable to mathematical and computational scrutiny. As\nsuch, we reproduce all known results on optimal universal cloning, and push the\nrecent results on asymmetric cloning much further, giving new trade-off\nrelations between fidelities for broad classes of optimal cloning machines. We\nalso provide substantial evidence that motivates why other parameter ranges\n(number of input copies) have not, and will not, yield to similar analysis.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of the heat dissipation in single-molecule\njunctions. In order to investigate the heat dissipation in the electrodes and\nthe relationship between the transmission spectra and the electronic\nstructures, we consider a toy model that in which electrodes linked by a\ntwo-level molecular bridge. By using of the Landauer approach, we show how heat\ndissipation in the electrodes of a molecular junction is related to its\ntransmission characteristics. We show that in general heat is not equally\ndissipated in the left and right electrodes of the junction and it depends on\nthe bias polarity and the positions of molecule's energy levels with respect to\nthe Fermi level. Also, we exploit the C$_{60}$ molecule as a junction and the\nresults show a good agreement with the toy model. Our results for the heat\ndissipation are remarkable in the sense that they can be used to detect which\nenergy levels of a junction are dominated in the transport process.\n", "  Effects of impurity on the spin-dependent transport in a single wall carbon\nnanotube spin-valve, as ferromagnetic electrode/carbon nanotube/ferromagnetic\nelectrode model junction is numerically investigated. Using a generalized\nGreen's function method and the Landauer-Buttiker formalism, the impurity\nconditions are determined by randomly substitution of carbon atoms in the\nhoneycomb carbon nanotube lattice by nitrogen and boron atoms. We have found\nthat transport characteristics, including the spin-dependent current and tunnel\nmagnetoresistance are strongly influenced by the impurity effects. We think\nthat the results of the present report could be useful for designing the future\nspintronic devices.\n", "  Using the tight-binding model and the generalized Green's function formalism,\nthe effect of quantum interference on the electron transport through the\nbenzene molecule in a semiconductor/benzene/semiconductor junction is\nnumerically investigated. We show how the quantum interference sources,\ndifferent contact positions and local gate, can control the transmission\ncharacteristics of the electrode/molecule/electrode junction. We also study the\noccurrence of anti-resonant states in the transmission probability function\nusing a simple graphical scheme (introduced in Ref.[Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys,\n2011, 13, 1431]) for different geometries of the contacts between the benzene\nmolecule and semiconductor(silicon and titanium dioxide) electrodes.\n", "  We introduce and present preliminary results from COCOA (Cluster simulatiOn\nComparison with ObservAtions) code for a star cluster after 12 Gyrs of\nevolution simulated using the MOCCA code. The COCOA code is being developed to\nquickly compare results of numerical simulations of star clusters with\nobservational data. We use COCOA to obtain parameters of the projected cluster\nmodel. For comparison, a FITS file of the projected cluster was provided to\nobservers so that they could use their observational methods and techniques to\nobtain cluster parameters. The results show that the similarity of cluster\nparameters obtained through numerical simulations and observations depends\nsignificantly on the quality of observational data and photometric accuracy.\n", "  We propose a hierarchy of nonlinearly dispersive generalized Korteweg--de\nVries (KdV) evolution equations based on a modification of the Lagrangian\ndensity whose induced action functional the KdV equation extremizes. It is\nshown that two recent nonlinear evolution equations describing wave propagation\nin certain generalized continua with an inherent material length scale are\nmembers of the proposed hierarchy. Like KdV, the equations from the proposed\nhierarchy possess Hamiltonian structure. Unlike KdV, however, the solutions to\nthese equations can be compact (i.e., they vanish outside of some open\ninterval) and, in addition, peaked. Implicit solutions for these peaked,\ncompact traveling waves (\"peakompactons\") are presented.\n", "  Following Minkowski's formulation of special relativity, it is generally\naccepted that we live in a four-dimensional world consisting of three space and\none time dimension. Due to its fundamental importance, a variety of arguments\nhave been proposed over the years attempting to derive this spacetime structure\nfrom underlying physical principles. In our approach, we show how Minkowski\nspacetime arises from the geometrical properties of three dimensional space. We\ndemonstrate this through modeling physical space with Clifford's geometric\nalgebra of three dimensions. We indeed find using this representation that a\ntime-like dimension arises naturally within this space but also extends\nspacetime to eight dimensions through incorporating four spin degrees of\nfreedom. This expanded arena of spacetime produces a generalized group of\nLorentz transformations and provides a natural description of fundamental\nparticles. Nearly all standard results are returned in this expanded structure\nand so its main achievement is that it provides an efficient alternative\nformalism to the conventional four-vector formalism but we were also able to\nidentify several areas where new physics may be indicated.\n", "  The Navier-Stokes equation contains two terms which have been subjected to\nslight modification: (a) the viscosity term depends of time (the viscosity in\naverage on time is zero, but its variance is non-zero), (b) the pressure\ngradient contains an added term describing the quantum entropy gradient\nmultiplied by the pressure. Owing to these modifications, the Navier-Stokes\nequation can be reduced to the Schr\\\"odinger equation describing behavior of a\nparticle into the vacuum being as a superfluid medium. Vortex structures\narising in this medium show infinitely long life owing to zeroth average\nviscosity. The non-zero variance describes exchange of the vortex energy with\nzero-point energy of the vacuum. Radius of the vortex trembles around some\naverage value. This observation sheds the light to the Zitterbewegung\nphenomenon. The long-lived vortex has a non-zero core where the vortex velocity\nvanishes.\n", "  In the high-energy quantum-physics literature one finds statements such as\n\"matrix algebras converge to the sphere\". Earlier I provided a general setting\nfor understanding such statements, in which the matrix algebras are viewed as\nquantum metric spaces, and convergence is with respect to a quantum\nGromov-Hausdorff-type distance. In the present paper, as preparation of\ndiscussing similar statements for convergence of \"vector bundles\" over matrix\nalgebras to vector bundles over spaces, we introduce and study suitable\nmatrix-norms for matrix algebras and spaces. Very recently Latremoliere\nintroduced an improved quantum Gromov-Hausdorff-type distance between quantum\nmetric spaces. We use it throughout this paper. To facilitate the calculations\nwe introduce and develop a general notion of \"bridges with conditional\nexpectations\".\n", "  We present quantum algorithms for the simulation of quantum systems in one\nspatial dimension, which result in quantum speedups that range from\nsuperpolynomial to polynomial. We first describe a method to simulate the\nevolution of the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) based on a refined analysis\nof the Trotter-Suzuki formula that exploits the Lie algebra structure. For\ntotal evolution time $t$ and precision $\\epsilon>0$, the complexity of our\nmethod is $ O(\\exp(\\gamma \\sqrt{\\log(N/\\epsilon)}))$, where $\\gamma>0$ is a\nconstant and $N$ is the quantum number associated with an \"energy cutoff\" of\nthe initial state. Remarkably, this complexity is subpolynomial in\n$N/\\epsilon$. We also provide a method to prepare discrete versions of the\neigenstates of the QHO of complexity polynomial in $\\log(N)/\\epsilon$, where\n$N$ is the dimension or number of points in the discretization. This method may\nbe of independent interest as it provides a way to prepare, e.g., quantum\nstates with Gaussian-like amplitudes. Next, we consider a system with a quartic\npotential. Our numerical simulations suggest a method for simulating the\nevolution of sublinear complexity $\\tilde O(N^{1/3+o(1)})$, for constant $t$\nand $\\epsilon$. We also analyze complex one-dimensional systems and prove a\ncomplexity bound $\\tilde O(N)$, under fairly general assumptions. Our quantum\nalgorithms may find applications in other problems. As an example, we discuss\nthe fractional Fourier transform, a generalization of the Fourier transform\nthat is useful for signal analysis and can be formulated in terms of the\nevolution of the QHO.\n", "  The prediction and realization of magnetic excitations driven by electrical\ncurrents via the spin transfer torque effect, enables novel magnetic\nnano-devices where spin-waves can be used to process and store information. The\nfunctional control of such devices relies on understanding the properties of\nnon-linear spin-wave excitations. It has been demonstrated that spin waves can\nshow both an itinerant character, but also appear as localized solitons. So\nfar, it was assumed that localized solitons have essentially cylindrical,\n$s-$like symmetry. Using a newly developed high-sensitivity time-resolved\nmagnetic x-ray microscopy, we instead observe the emergence of a novel\nlocalized soliton excitation with a nodal line, i.e. with $p-$like symmetry.\nMicromagnetic simulations identify the physical mechanism that controls the\ntransition from $s-$ to $p-$like solitons. Our results suggest a potential new\npathway to design artificial atoms with tunable dynamical states using\nnanoscale magnetic devices.\n", "  In this paper, we construct the Sato theory including the Hirota bilinear\nequations and tau function of a new $q$-deformed Toda hierarchy(QTH). Meanwhile\nthe Block type additional symmetry and bi-Hamiltonian structure of this\nhierarchy are given. From Hamiltonian tau symmetry, we give another definition\nof tau function of this hierarchy. Afterwards, we extend the $q$-Toda hierarchy\nto an extended $q$-Toda hierarchy(EQTH) which satisfy a generalized Hirota\nquadratic equation in terms of generalized vertex operators. The Hirota\nquadratic equation might have further application in Gromov-Witten theory. The\ncorresponding Sato theory including multi-fold Darboux transformations of this\nextended hierarchy is also constructed. At last, we construct the\nmulticomponent extension of the $q$-Toda hierarchy and show the integrability\nincluding its bi-Hamiltonian structure, tau symmetry and conserved densities.\n", "  We present a scanning transmission x-ray microscopy setup combined with a\nnovel microwave synchronization scheme in order to study high frequency\nmagnetization dynamics at synchrotron light sources. The sensitivity necessary\nto detect small changes of the magnetization on short time scales and nanometer\nspatial dimensions is achieved by combination of the developed excitation\nmechanism with a single photon counting electronics that is locked to the\nsynchrotron operation frequency. The required mechanical stability is achieved\nby a compact design of the microscope. Our instrument is capable of creating\ndirect images of dynamical phenomena in the 5-10 GHz range, with 35 nm\nresolution. When used together with circularly polarized x-rays, the above\ncapabilities can be combined to study magnetic phenomena at microwave\nfrequencies, such as ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and spin waves. We\ndemonstrate the capabilities of our technique by presenting phase resolved\nimages of a 6 GHz nanoscale spin wave generated by a spin torque oscillator, as\nwell as the uniform ferromagnetic precession with ~0.1 deg amplitude at 9 GHz\nin a micrometer-sized cobalt strip.\n", "  It was repeatedly underlined in literature that quantum mechanics cannot be\nconsidered a closed theory if the Born Rule is postulated rather than derived\nfrom the first principles. In this work the Born Rule is derived from the\ntime-reversal symmetry of quantum equations of motion. The derivation is based\non a simple functional equation that takes into account properties of\nprobability, as well as the linearity and time-reversal symmetry of quantum\nequations of motion. The derivation presented in this work also allows to\ndetermine certain limits to applicability of the Born Rule.\n", "  We consider a system of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice as a quantum\nsimulator for electron-positron pair production in quantum electrodynamics\n(QED). For a setup in one spatial dimension, we investigate the nonequilibrium\nphenomenon of pair production including the backreaction leading to plasma\noscillations. Unlike previous investigations on quantum link models, we focus\non the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of QED and show that it may be well\napproximated by experiments employing Bose-Einstein condensates interacting\nwith fermionic atoms. The calculations based on functional integral techniques\ngive a unique access to the physical parameters required to realize the QED\nphenomena in a cold atom experiment. In particular, we use our approach to\nconsider quantum link models in a yet unexplored parameter regime and give\nbounds for their ability to capture essential features of the physics. The\nresults suggest a paradigmatic change towards realizations using coherent\nmany-body states rather than single atoms for quantum simulations of\nhigh-energy particle physics phenomena.\n", "  We determine the essential spectrum of Hamiltonians with N-body type\ninteractions that have radial limits at infinity. This extends the HVZ-theorem,\nwhich treats perturbations of the Laplacian by potentials that tend to zero at\ninfinity. Our proof involves $C^*$-algebra techniques that allows one to treat\nlarge classes of operators with local singularities and general behavior at\ninfinity. In our case, the configuration space of the system is a finite\ndimensional, real vector space $X$, and we consider the $C^*$-algebra\n$\\mathcal{E}(X)$ of functions on $X$ generated by functions of the form\n$v\\circ\\pi_Y$, where $Y$ runs over the set of all linear subspaces of $X$,\n$\\pi_Y$ is the projection of $X$ onto the quotient $X/Y$, and\n$v:X/Y\\to\\mathbb{C}$ is a continuous function that has uniform radial limits at\ninfinity. The group $X$ acts by translations on $\\mathcal{E}(X)$, and hence the\ncrossed product $\\mathscr{E}(X) := \\mathcal{E}(X)\\rtimes X$ is well defined;\nthe Hamiltonians that are of interest to us are the self-adjoint operators\naffiliated to it. We determine the characters of $\\mathcal{E}(X)$. This then\nallows us to describe the quotient of $\\mathscr{E}(X)$ with respect to the\nideal of compact operators, which in turn gives a formula for the essential\nspectrum of any self-adjoint operator affiliated to $\\mathscr(X)$.\n", "  The unknown neutrino mass hierarchy -- whether the $\\nu_3$ mass eigenstate is\nthe heaviest or the lightest -- represents a major gap in our knowledge of\nneutrino properties. Determining the hierarchy is a critical step toward\nfurther precision measurements in the neutrino sector. The hierarchy is also\ncentral to interpreting the next generation of neutrinoless double beta decay\nresults, plays a role in numerous cosmological and astrophysical questions, and\nserves as a powerful model discriminant for theories of neutrino mass\ngeneration and unification. Various current and planned experiments claim\nsensitivity for establishing the neutrino mass hierarchy. We review the most\npromising of these here, paying special attention to points of concern and\nconsolidating the projected sensitivities into an outlook for the years ahead.\n", "  We investigate the exact results for circular 1/4 and 1/2 BPS Wilson loops in\nthe $d=3$ ${\\mathcal N}=4$ super Chern-Simons-matter theory that could be\nobtained by orbifolding Aharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena (ABJM) theory. The\npartition function of the ${\\mathcal N}=4$ orbifold ABJM theory has been\ncomputed previously in the literature. In this paper, we re-derive it using a\nslightly different method. We calculate the vacuum expectation values of the\ncircular 1/4 BPS Wilson loops in fundamental representation and of circular 1/2\nBPS Wilson loops in arbitrary representations. We use both the saddle point\napproach and Fermi gas approach. The results for Wilson loops are in accord\nwith the available gravity results.\n", "  Tomograms are obtained as probability distributions and are used to\nreconstruct a quantum state from experimentally measured values. We study the\nevolution of tomograms for different quantum systems, both finite and infinite\ndimensional. In realistic experimental conditions, the quantum states are\nexposed to the ambient environment and hence subject to effects like\ndecoherence and dissipation, which are dealt with here, consistently, using the\nformalism of open quantum systems. This is extremely relevant from the\nperspective of experimental implementation and issues related to state\nreconstruction in quantum computation and communication. These considerations\nare also expected to affect the quasiprobability distribution obtained from\nexperimentally generated tomograms and nonclassicality observed from them.\n", "  As an undergraduate exercise, in an article (2012 Am. J. Phys. $\\bf{80}$\n780-14), quantum and classical uncertainties for dimensionless variables of\nposition and momentum were evaluated in three potentials: infinite well,\nbouncing ball, and harmonic oscillator. While original quantum uncertainty\nproducts depend on ${\\rm{\\hbar}}$ and the number of states ($n$), a\ndimensionless approach makes the comparison between quantum uncertainty and\nclassical dispersion possible by excluding ${\\rm{\\hbar}}$. But the question is\nwhether the uncertainty still remains dependent on quantum number $n$. In the\nabove-mentioned article, there lies this contrast, on the one hand, the\ndimensionless quantum uncertainty of the potential box approaches classical\ndispersion only in the limit of large quantum numbers ($n\\to \\infty\n$)-consistent with the correspondence principle. On the other hand, similar\nevaluations for bouncing ball and harmonic oscillator potentials are equal to\ntheir classical counterparts independent of $n$. This equality may hide the\nquantum feature of low energy levels. In the current study, we change the\npotential intervals in order to make them symmetric for the linear potential\nand non-symmetric for the quadratic potential. As a result, it is shown in this\npaper that the dimensionless quantum uncertainty of these potentials in the new\npotential intervals is expressed in terms of quantum number $n$. In other\nwords, the uncertainty requires the correspondence principle in order to\napproach the classical limit. Therefore, it can be concluded that the\ndimensionless analysis, as a useful pedagogical method, does not take away the\nquantum feature of the n-dependence of quantum uncertainty in general.\nMoreover, our numerical calculations include the higher powers of the position\nfor the potentials.\n", "  We study the dynamical evolution of Chern-band systems after subjecting them\nto local quenches. For open-boundary systems, we show for half-filling that the\nchiral nature of edge states is manifested in the time-dependent chiral\nresponse to local density quenches on the edge. In the presence of power-law\ntraps, we show how to mimic the half-filling situation by choosing the\nappropriate number of fermions depending on the trap size, and explore chiral\nresponses of edges to local quenches in such a configuration. We find that\nperturbations resulting from the quenches propagate at different group\nvelocities depending on the bulk band gap. Our results provide different routes\nto check dynamically the non-trivial nature of Chern bands.\n", "  Diverse models of engines energised by quantum-coherent, hence non-thermal,\nbaths allow the engine efficiency to transgress the standard thermodynamic\nCarnot bound. These transgressions call for an elucidation of the underlying\nmechanisms. Here we show that non-thermal baths may impart not only heat, but\nalso mechanical work to a machine. The Carnot bound is inapplicable to such a\nhybrid machine. Intriguingly, it may exhibit dual action, concurrently as\nengine and refrigerator, with up to 100% efficiency. We conclude that even\nthough a machine powered by a quantum bath may exhibit an unconventional\nperformance, it still abides by the traditional principles of thermodynamics.\n", "  The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation is conjectured to universally describe\nthe fluctuations of weakly asymmetric interface growth. Here we provide the\nfirst intrinsic well-posedness result for the KPZ equation on the real line by\nshowing that its energy solutions (as introduced by Gon\\c{c}alves and Jara and\nlater refined by Gubinelli and Jara) are unique. Together with various\nconvergence results already present in the literature, this establishes the\nweak KPZ universality conjecture for a wide class of models. A remarkable\nconsequence is that the energy solution to the KPZ equation is not equal to the\nCole-Hopf solution, but it involves an additional drift $t/12$.\n", "  We compute the hydrodynamic torque on a dumbbell (two spheres linked by a\nmassless rigid rod) settling in a quiescent fluid at small but finite Reynolds\nnumber. The spheres have the same mass densities but different sizes. When the\nsizes are quite different the dumbbell settles vertically, aligned with the\ndirection of gravity, the largest sphere first. But when the size difference is\nsufficiently small then its steady-state angle is determined by a competition\nbetween the size difference and the Reynolds number. When the sizes of the\nspheres are exactly equal then fluid inertia causes the dumbbell to settle in a\nhorizontal orientation.\n", "  Quantum measurements are crucial to observe the properties of a quantum\nsystem, which however unavoidably perturb its state and dynamics in an\nirreversible way. Here we study the dynamics of a quantum system while being\nsubject to a sequence of projective measurements applied at random times. In\nthe case of independent and identically distributed intervals of time between\nconsecutive measurements, we analytically demonstrate that the survival\nprobability of the system to remain in the projected state assumes a\nlarge-deviation (exponentially decaying) form in the limit of an infinite\nnumber of measurements. This allows us to estimate the typical value of the\nsurvival probability, which can therefore be tuned by controlling the\nprobability distribution of the random time intervals. Our analytical results\nare numerically tested for Zeno-protected entangled states, which also\ndemonstrates that the presence of disorder in the measurement sequence further\nenhances the survival probability when the Zeno limit is not reached (as it\nhappens in experiments). Our studies provide a new tool for protecting and\ncontrolling the amount of quantum coherence in open complex quantum systems by\nmeans of tunable stochastic measurements.\n", "  This paper establishes three relations between the Toda field theory\nassociated to a simple Lie algebra and the integral curves of the standard\ndifferential system on the corresponding complete flag variety. The motivation\ncomes from the viewpoint on the Toda field theories as Darboux integrable\ndifferential systems as developed in \\cite{AFV}. First, we establish an\nisomorphism concerning regular functions on the jet space and on the unipotent\nsubgroup in the setting of a simple Lie group. Using this result, we then show\nthat in the sense of differential systems, after restricting one independent\nvariable to a constant the Toda field theory becomes the system for integral\ncurves of the standard differential system on a complete flag variety. Finally,\nwe establish that, in terms of differential invariants, the Toda field theory\nis the quotient of the product of two such systems by a natural group action.\n", "  The relative partition function and the relative zeta function of the\nperturbation of the Laplace operator by a Coulomb potential plus a point\ninteraction centered in the origin is discussed. Applications to the study of\nthe Casimir effect are indicated.\n", "  Locating planets in circumstellar Habitable Zones is a priority for many\nexoplanet surveys. Space-based and ground-based surveys alike require robust\ntoolsets to aid in target selection and mission planning. We present the\nCatalog of Earth-Like Exoplanet Survey Targets (CELESTA), a database of\nHabitable Zones around 36,000 nearby stars. We calculated stellar parameters,\nincluding effective temperatures, masses, and radii, and we quantified the\norbital distances and periods corresponding to the circumstellar Habitable\nZones. We gauged the accuracy of our predictions by contrasting CELESTA's\ncomputed parameters to observational data. We ascertain a potential return on\ninvestment by computing the number of Habitable Zones probed for a given survey\nduration. A versatile framework for extending the functionality of CELESTA into\nthe future enables ongoing comparisons to new observations, and recalculations\nwhen updates to Habitable Zone models, stellar temperatures, or parallax data\nbecome available. We expect to upgrade and expand CELESTA using data from the\nGaia mission as the data becomes available.\n", "  In this paper, we construct the Virasoro type additional symmetries of a kind\nof constrained multi-component KP hierarchy and give the Virasoro flow equation\non eigenfunctions and adjoint eigenfunctions. It can also be seen that the\nalgebraic structure of the Virasoro symmetry is kept after discretization from\nthe constrained multi-component KP hierarchy to the discrete constrained\nmulti-component KP hierarchy.\n", "  We exploit flow propagation on the directed neuronal network of the nematode\nCaenorhabditis elegans to reveal dynamically relevant features of its\nconnectome. We find flow-based groupings of neurons at different levels of\ngranularity, which we relate to functional and anatomical constituents of its\nnervous system. A systematic in silico evaluation of the full set of single and\ndouble neuron ablations is used to identify deletions that induce the most\nsevere disruptions of the multi-resolution flow structure. Such ablations are\nlinked to functionally relevant neurons, and suggest potential candidates for\nfurther in vivo investigation. In addition, we use the directional patterns of\nincoming and outgoing network flows at all scales to identify flow profiles for\nthe neurons in the connectome, without pre-imposing a priori categories. The\nfour flow roles identified are linked to signal propagation motivated by\nbiological input-response scenarios.\n", "  We present transport and scanning SQUID measurements on InAs/GaSb double\nquantum wells, a system predicted to be a two-dimensional topological\ninsulator. Top and back gates allow independent control of density and band\noffset, allowing tuning from the trivial to the topological regime. In the\ntrivial regime, bulk conductivity is quenched but transport persists along the\nedges, superficially resembling the predicted helical edge-channels in the\ntopological regime. We characterize edge conduction in the trivial regime in a\nwide variety of sample geometries and measurement configurations, as a function\nof temperature, magnetic field, and edge length. Despite similarities to\nstudies claiming measurements of helical edge channels, our characterization\npoints to a non-topological origin for these observations.\n", "  In this paper we construct and classify novel Drukker-Trancanelli (DT) type\nBPS Wilson loops along infinite straight lines and circles in $\\mathcal N=2,3$\nquiver superconformal Chern-Simons-matter theories,\nAharony-Bergman-Jafferis-Maldacena (ABJM) theory, and $\\mathcal N=4$ orbifold\nABJM theory. Generally we have four classes of Wilson loops, and all of them\npreserve the same supersymmetries as the BPS Gaiotto-Yin (GY) type Wilson\nloops. There are several free complex parameters in the DT type BPS Wilson\nloops, and for two classes of Wilson loops in ABJM theory and $\\mathcal N=4$\norbifold ABJM theory there are supersymmetry enhancements at special values of\nthe parameters. We check that the differences of the DT type and GY type Wilson\nloops are $Q$-exact with $Q$ being some supercharges preserved by both the DT\ntype and GY type Wilson loops. The results would be useful to calculate vacuum\nexpectation values of the DT type Wilson loops in matrix models if they are\nstill BPS quantum mechanically.\n", "  We develop a Bloch vector representation of Unruh channel for a Dirac field\nmode. This is used to provide a unified, analytical treatment of quantum Fisher\nand Skew information for a qubit subjected to the Unruh channel, both in its\npure form as well as in the presence of experimentally relevant external noise\nchannels. The time evolution of Fisher and Skew information is studied along\nwith the impact of external environment parameters such as temperature and\nsqueezing. The external noises are modelled by both purely dephasing phase\ndamping as well as the squeezed generalized amplitude damping channels. An\ninteresting interplay between the external reservoir temperature and squeezing\non the Fisher and Skew information is observed, in particular, for the action\nof the squeezed generalized amplitude damping channel. It is seen that for some\nregimes, squeezing can enhance the quantum information against the\ndeteriorating influence of the ambient environment. Similar features are also\nobserved for the analogous study of Skew information, highlighting the similar\norigin of the Fisher and Skew information.\n", "  We demonstrate a new method to constrain gravity on the largest cosmological\nscales by combining measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing\nand the galaxy velocity field. $E_G$ is a statistic, constructed from a\ngravitational lensing tracer and a measure of velocities such as redshift-space\ndistortions (RSD), that can discriminate between gravity models while being\nindependent of clustering bias and $\\sigma_8$. While traditionally, the lensing\nfield for $E_G$ has been probed through galaxy lensing, CMB lensing has been\nproposed as a more robust tracer of the lensing field for $E_G$ at higher\nredshifts while avoiding intrinsic alignments. We perform the largest-scale\nmeasurement of $E_G$ ever, up to 150 Mpc/$h$, by cross-correlating the Planck\nCMB lensing map with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) CMASS galaxy\nsample and combining this with our measurement of the CMASS auto-power spectrum\nand the RSD parameter $\\beta$. We report $E_G(z=0.57)=0.243\\pm0.060$ (stat)\n$\\pm0.013$ (sys), a measurement in tension with the general relativity\nprediction at a level of 2.6$\\sigma$. Note that our $E_G$ measurement deviates\nfrom GR only at scales greater than 80 Mpc/$h$, scales which have not been\nprobed by previous $E_G$ tests. Upcoming surveys, which will provide an\norder-of-magnitude reduction in statistical errors, can significantly constrain\nalternative gravity models when combined with better control of systematics.\n", "  It is agreed that Chandrasekhar mass and central density of white dwarfs are\nindependent, which means that there is a whole series of stars having radius\nand central density as parameters that all have the same Chandrasekhar mass. In\nthis article the influence of a quantum gravity is shown so the Chandrasekhar\nlimits (mass and radius) depend explicitly on the central density and gravity\nparameters. A new polytropic relation between degenerate pressure of the star\nand its density is investigated. This leads to a modification in Lane-Emden\nequation and mass and radius formulas of the star. A modified Lane-Emden\nequation is solved numerically with consideration to the mass density of the\nstar depends on its radius. The solution used in calculating the mass and\nradius limit of the white dwarf. It was found that mass and radius limits\ndecrease due to increase in central density and gravity parameters in a\ncomparison with the original values. We can say that central density and\nquantum gravity constitute a new tool that can help to make the theoretical\nvalues corresponding to experimental observations apply in a better manner.\n", "  The scaling of photoproduction $\\gamma p\\to\\pi^0 p$ is investigated in the\nReggeized model with $N^*$ and $\\Delta$ resonances included to describe\nresonance peaks up to photon energy $E_\\gamma$= 3 GeV. Given the $t$-channel\nexchanges $\\rho(770)+\\omega(780)+b_1(1235)+h_1(1170)$ Reggeized for the\nbackground contribution, the resonances of the Breit-Wigner form are introduced\nto agree with cross sections for total, differential and beam asymmetry in the\nlow energy region. The scaled differential-cross sections $s^7{d\\sigma/ dt}$\nare reproduced to agree with the recent JLab data, revealing the production\nmechanism of the big bump structure around $W\\approx 2.2$ GeV by the deep-dip\npattern of the $\\omega$ exchange that originates from the zeros of the\ntrajectory $\\alpha_\\omega(t)=0$ in the canonical phase, ${1\\over2}(-1+e^{-i\\pi\n\\alpha_{\\omega}(t)})$.\n", "  We measure the evolution of the velocity dispersion--temperature\n($\\sigma_{\\rm v}$--$T_{\\rm X}$) relation up to $z = 1$ using a sample of 38\ngalaxy clusters drawn from the \\textit{XMM} Cluster Survey. This work improves\nupon previous studies by the use of a homogeneous cluster sample and in terms\nof the number of high redshift clusters included. We present here new redshift\nand velocity dispersion measurements for 12 $z > 0.5$ clusters observed with\nthe GMOS instruments on the Gemini telescopes. Using an orthogonal regression\nmethod, we find that the slope of the relation is steeper than that expected if\nclusters were self-similar, and that the evolution of the normalisation is\nslightly negative, but not significantly different from zero ($\\sigma_{\\rm v}\n\\propto T^{0.86 \\pm 0.14} E(z)^{-0.37 \\pm 0.33}$). We verify our results by\napplying our methods to cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The lack of\nevolution seen in our data is consistent with simulations that include both\nfeedback and radiative cooling.\n", "  A new scheme of the perturbative analysis of the nonlinear HS equations is\ndeveloped giving directly the final result for the successive application of\nthe homotopy integrations which appear in the standard approach. It drastically\nsimplifies the analysis and results from the application of the standard\nspectral sequence approach to the higher-spin covariant derivatives, allowing\nus in particular to reduce multiple homotopy integrals resulting from the\nsuccessive application of the homotopy trick to a single integral. Efficiency\nof the proposed method is illustrated by various examples. In particular, it is\nshown how the Central on-shell theorem of the free theory immediately results\nfrom the nonlinear HS field equations with no intermediate computations.\n", "  We present a new analytic approach to describe large scale structure\nformation in the mildly non-linear regime. The central object of the method is\nthe time-dependent probability distribution function generating correlators of\nthe cosmological observables at a given moment of time. Expanding the\ndistribution function around the Gaussian weight we formulate a perturbative\ntechnique to calculate non-linear corrections to cosmological correlators,\nsimilar to the diagrammatic expansion in a three-dimensional Euclidean quantum\nfield theory, with time playing the role of an external parameter. For the\nphysically relevant case of cold dark matter in an Einstein--de Sitter\nuniverse, the time evolution of the distribution function can be found exactly\nand is encapsulated by a time-dependent coupling constant controlling the\nperturbative expansion. We show that all building blocks of the expansion are\nfree from spurious infrared enhanced contributions that plague the standard\ncosmological perturbation theory. This paves the way towards the systematic\nresummation of infrared effects in large scale structure formation. We also\nargue that the approach proposed here provides a natural framework to account\nfor the influence of short-scale dynamics on larger scales along the lines of\neffective field theory.\n", "  A rotating black hole threaded by an infinitely long cosmic string is studied\nin the framework of the Abelian Higgs model. We show that contrary to a common\nbelief, in the presence of rotation the backreaction of the string does not\ninduce a simple conical deficit. This leads to new distinct features of the\nKerr--string system such as modified ISCO or shifted ergosphere, though these\neffects are likely outside the range of observational precision. For an\nextremal rotating black hole, the system exhibits a first-order phase\ntransition for the gravitational Meissner effect: whereas the horizon of large\nblack holes is pierced by the vortex, small black holes exhibit a flux-expelled\nsolution, with the gauge and scalar field remaining identically in their false\nvacuum state on the event horizon. A brief review prepared for the MG14\nProceedings.\n", "  We analyze the interplay between superconductivity and the formation of bound\npairs of fermions (BCS-BEC crossover) in 2D models of interacting fermions with\nsmall Fermi energy EF and weak attractive interaction, which extends to\nenergies well above EF. The 2D case is special because one has to distinguish\nbetween bound state formation and superconductivity already at weak coupling.\nWe briefly review the situation in the one-band model and then consider two\ndifferent two-band models: the one with a hole and an electron band, and the\none with two electron bands. In each case we obtain the bound state energy 2 E0\nfor two fermions in a vacuum and solve the set of coupled equations for the\npairing gaps and the chemical potentials to obtain the onset temperature of the\npairing, Tins and the quasiparticle dispersion. We then compute the superfluid\nstiffness and obtain the actual Tc. We show that, at EF >> E0 the behavior of\nboth two-band models is BCS-like in the sense that Tc almost coincides with\nTins and both are much smaller than EF. At EF < E0, the two models behave\ndifferently: in the model with two electron bands, Tins ~E0/log(E0/EF) and Tc\n~EF << Tins. In between Tins and Tc the system displays preformed pair\nbehavior. In the model with a hole and an electron band, Tins ~ Tc and both\nremain finite at EF=0 The preformed pair behavior still exists in this model\nbecause Tc is numerically smaller than Tins. For both models we re-express Tins\nin terms of the fully renormalized two-particle scattering amplitude by\nextending to two-band case the method pioneered by Gorkov and Melik-Barkhudarov\nback in 1961. We apply our results to to Nb-doped SrTiO3 and to Fe-pnictides\nand Fe-chalcogenides, particularly to FeSe, in which superconducting gap is\ncomparable to the Fermi energy.\n", "  Active fluids and growing interfaces are two well-studied but very different\nnon-equilibrium systems. Each exhibits non-equilibrium behavior quite different\nfrom that of their equilibrium counterparts. Here we demonstrate a surprising\nconnection between these two: the ordered phase of incompressible polar active\nfluids in two spatial dimensions without momentum conservation, and growing\none-dimensional interfaces (that is, the 1+1-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang\nequation), in fact belong to the same universality class. This universality\nclass also includes two equilibrium systems : two-dimensional smectic liquid\ncrystals, and a peculiar kind of constrained two-dimensional ferromagnet. We\nuse these connections to show that two-dimensional incompressible flocks are\nrobust against fluctuations, and exhibit universal long-ranged, anisotropic\nspatio-temporal correlations of those fluctuations. We also thereby determine\nthe exact values of the anisotropy exponent $\\zeta$ and the roughness exponents\n$\\chi_{_{x,y}}$ that characterize these correlations.\n", "  For a resonance decaying to $\\tau^+\\tau^-$, it is difficult to reconstruct\nits mass accurately because of the presence of neutrinos in the decay products\nof the $\\tau$ leptons. If the resonance is heavy enough, we show that its mass\ncan be well determined by the momentum component of the $\\tau$ decay products\nperpendicular to the velocity of the $\\tau$ lepton, $p_{\\perp}$, and the mass\nof the visible/invisible decay products, $m_{vis/inv}$, for $\\tau$ decaying to\nhadrons/leptons. By sampling all kinematically allowed values of $p_{\\perp}$\nand $m_{vis/inv}$ according to their joint probability distributions determined\nby the MC simulations, the mass of the mother resonance is assumed to lie at\nthe position with the maximal probability. Since $p_{\\perp}$ and $m_{vis/inv}$\nare invariant under the boost in the $\\tau$ lepton direction, the joint\nprobability distributions are independent upon $\\tau$'s origin. Thus this\ntechnique is able to determine the mass of an unknown resonance with no\nefficiency loss. It is tested using the MC simulations of the physics processes\n$ pp \\to Z/h(125)/h(750)+X\\to \\tau\\tau+X$ at 13~TeV. The ratio of the full\nwidth at half maximum and the peak value of the reconstructed mass distribution\nis found to be 20\\%-40\\% using the information of missing transverse energy.\n", "  In the framework of one-pion-exchange (OPE) model, we study the hidden-charm\nand charm-strange molecular pentaquark systems composed of a heavy baryon\n$(\\Sigma_c, \\Sigma_c^*)$ and a vector meson $(\\bar{K}^*, \\bar{D}^*)$, where the\nS-D mixing effect is considered in our calculation. Our result shows that the\n$\\Sigma_c\\bar{D}^*$ molecular state with $(I=1/2,J^P=3/2^-)$ and the\n$\\Sigma_c^*\\bar{D}^*$ molecular state with $(I=1/2,J^P=5/2^-)$ exist in the\nmass range of the observed $P_c(4380)$ and $P_c(4450)$, respectively. Moreover,\nwe predict two other hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks with configurations\n$\\Sigma_c\\bar{D}^*$ $(I=3/2, J^P=1/2^-)$ and $\\Sigma_c^*\\bar{D}^*$ $(I=3/2,\nJ^P=1/2^-)$ and two charm-strange molecular pentaquarks $P_{cs}(3340)$ and\n$P_{cs}(3400)$ corresponding to the $\\Sigma_c\\bar{K}^*$ configuration with\n$(I=1/2, J^P=3/2^-)$ and the $\\Sigma_c^*\\bar{K}^*$ configuration with $(I=1/2,\nJ^P=5/2^-)$, respectively. Additionally, we also predict some hidden-bottom\n$\\Sigma_b^{(*)}B^*$ and $B_c$-like $\\Sigma_c^{(*)}B^*/\\Sigma_b^{(*)}\\bar{D}^*$\npentaquarks.\n", "  If the LHC should fail to observe direct signals for new physics, it may\nbecome necessary to look for new physics effects in rare events such as\nflavour-changing decays of the top quark, which, in the Standard Model, are\npredicted to be too small to be observed. We set up the theoretical framework\nin which experimentally accessible results can be expected in models of new\nphysics, and go on to discuss two models of supersymmetry -- one with conserved\n$R$-parity, and one without $R$-parity -- to illustrate how the\nflavour-changing signals are predicted in these models. In the latter case,\nthere is a distinct possibility of detecting the rare decay $t \\to c + Z^0$ at\nthe LHC. We also present a detailed set of very general formulae which can be\nused to make similar calculations in diverse models of new physics.\n", "  The discovery of non-magnetic extreme magnetoresistance (XMR) materials has\ninduced great interests because the XMR phenomenon challenges our understanding\nof how a magnetic field can alter electron transport in semimetals. Among XMR\nmaterials, the LaSb shows XMR and field-induced exotic behaviors but it seems\nto lack the essentials for these properties. Here, we study the\nmagnetotransport properties and electronic structure of LaBi, isostructural to\nLaSb. LaBi exhibits large MR as in LaSb, which can be ascribed to the nearly\ncompensated electron and hole with rather high mobilities. More importantly,\nour analysis suggests that the XMR as well as field-induced resistivity upturn\nand plateau observed in LaSb and LaBi can be well explained by the two-band\nmodel with the compensation situation. We present the critical conditions\nleading to these field-induced properties. It will contribute to understanding\nthe XMR phenomenon and explore novel XMR materials.\n", "  We explore the inelastic electron scattering cross section off a quantum dot\nclose to the Stoner instability. We focus on the regime of strong Coulomb\nblockade in which the scattering cross section is dominated by the cotunneling\nprocesses. For large enough exchange interaction the quantum dot acquires a\nfinite total spin in the ground state. In this, so-called mesoscopic Stoner\ninstability, regime we find that at low enough temperatures the inelastic\nscattering cross section (including the contribution due to an elastic electron\nspin-flip) for an electron with a low energy with respect to the chemical\npotential is different from the case of a magnetic impurity with the same spin.\nThis difference stems from (i) presence of a low-lying many-body states of a\nquantum dot and (ii) the correlations of the tunneling amplitudes. Our results\nprovide a possible explanation for absence of the dephasing rate saturation at\nlow temperatures in recent experiment [N. Teneh, A. Yu. Kuntsevich, V. M.\nPudalov, and M. Reznikov, Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 226403 (2012)] in which\nexistence of local spin droplets in disordered electron liquid has been\nunraveled.\n", "  We report a measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry, $A_{FB}$, in\n$b\\bar{b}$ pairs produced in proton-antiproton collisions and identified by\nmuons from semileptonic $b$-hadron decays. The event sample was collected at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV with the CDF II detector and\ncorresponds to 6.9 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity. We obtain an integrated\nasymmetry of $A_{FB}(b\\bar{b})=(1.2 \\pm 0.7)$\\% at the particle level for\n$b$-quark pairs with invariant mass, $m_{b\\bar{b}}$, down to $40$ GeV/$c^2$ and\nmeasure the dependence of $A_{FB}(b\\bar{b})$ on $m_{b\\bar{b}}$. The results are\ncompatible with expectations from the standard model.\n", "  We describe the structure of the bijective transformations on the set of\ndensity operators which preserve the Bregman $f$-divergence for an arbitrary\ndifferentiable strictly convex function $f.$ Furthermore, we determine the\npreservers of the Jensen $f$-divergence in the case when the generating\nfunction $f$ belongs to a recently introduced function class called Matrix\nEntropy Class.\n", "  Recent progress in treating the dynamically screened nature of the Coulomb\ninteraction in strongly correlated lattice models and materials is reviewed\nwith a focus on computational schemes based on the dynamical mean field\napproximation. We discuss approximate and exact methods for the solution of\nimpurity models with retarded interactions, and explain how these models appear\nas auxiliary problems in various extensions of the dynamical mean field\nformalism. The current state of the field is illustrated with results from\nrecent applications of these schemes to U-V Hubbard models and correlated\nmaterials.\n", "  We determine the exact dynamics of an initial Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)\nstate of ultra-cold atoms in a deep hexagonal optical lattice. The dynamical\nevolution is triggered by a quench of the lattice potential, such that the\ninteraction strength $U_f$ is much larger than the hopping amplitude $J_f$. The\nquench initiates collective oscillations with frequency $|U_f|/(2\\pi)$ in the\nmomentum occupation numbers and imprints an oscillating phase with the same\nfrequency on the BCS order parameter $\\Delta$. The oscillation frequency of\n$\\Delta$ is not reproduced by treating the time evolution in mean-field theory.\nIn our theory, the momentum noise (i.e. density-density) correlation functions\noscillate at frequency $|U_f|/2\\pi$ as well as at its second harmonic. For a\nvery deep lattice, with zero tunneling energy, the oscillations of momentum\noccupation numbers are undamped. Non-zero tunneling after the quench leads to\ndephasing of the different momentum modes and a subsequent damping of the\noscillations. The damping occurs even for a finite-temperature initial BCS\nstate, but not for a non-interacting Fermi gas. Furthermore, damping is\nstronger for larger order parameter and may therefore be used as a signature of\nthe BCS state. Finally, our theory shows that the noise correlation functions\nin a honeycomb lattice will develop strong anti-correlations near the Dirac\npoint.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of searching the lepton-flavor-violating (LFV)\n$\\tau\\rightarrow \\mu\\gamma$ rare decay at the Super Charm-Tau Factory (CTF). By\ncomparing the kinematic distributions of the LFV signal and the standard model\n(SM) background, we develop an optimized event selection criteria which can\nsignificantly reduce the background events. It is concluded that new $2 \\sigma$\nupper limit of about $1.9 \\times 10^{-9}$ on $Br(\\tau \\rightarrow \\mu \\gamma)$\ncan be obtained at the CTF, which is beyond the capability of Super-B factory\nin searching $\\tau$ lepton rare decay. Within the framework of the scalar\nleptoquark model, a joint constraint on $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2$ and $M_{LQ}$ can\nbe derived from the upper bound on $Br(\\tau \\rightarrow \\mu \\gamma)$. With\n$1000~ fb^{-1}$ data expected at the CTF, we get $\\lambda_1\\lambda_2 < 7.2\n\\times 10^{-2}~(M_{LQ} = 800~ {\\rm GeV})$ and $M_{LQ} > 900~{\\rm\nGeV}~(\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 = 9 \\times 10^{-2})$ at $95\\%$ confidence level\n(C.L.).\n", "  We propose a general scheme for diagnosing interaction-driven topological\nphases in the weak interaction regime using exact diagonalization (ED). The\nscheme comprises the analysis of eigenvalues of the point-group operators for\nthe many-body eigenstates and the correlation functions for physical\nobservables to extract the symmetries of the order parameters and the\ntopological numbers of the underlying ground states at the thermodynamic limit\nfrom a relatively small size system afforded by ED. As a concrete example, we\ninvestigate the interaction effects on the half-filled spinless fermions on the\ncheckerboard lattice with a quadratic band crossing point. Numerical results\nsupport the existence of a spontaneous quantum anomalous Hall phase purely\ndriven by a nearest-neighbor weak repulsive interaction, separated from a\nnematic Mott insulator phase at strong repulsive interaction by a first-order\nphase transition.\n", "  We construct a gauge invariant action for the Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond\nsectors of open superstring field theory realizing a cyclic $A_\\infty$\nstructure, providing the first complete and fully explicit solution to the\nclassical Batalin-Vilkovisky master equation in superstring field theory. We\nalso demonstrate the equivalence of our action to the Wess-Zumino-Witten-based\nconstruction of Kunitomo and one of the authors.\n", "  Using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, it has been recently\ndemonstrated that water molecules align in response to an imposed temperature\ngradient, resulting in an effective electric field. Here, we investigate how\nthermally induced fields depend on the underlying treatment of long-ranged\ninteractions. For the short-ranged Wolf method and Ewald summation, we find the\npeak strength of the field to range between $2 \\times 10^7$ and $5 \\times\n10^7~\\text{V/m}$ for a temperature gradient of $5.2~\\text{K/}\\unicode{x212B}$.\nOur value for the Wolf method is therefore an order of magnitude lower than the\nliterature value [J. Chem. Phys. 139, 014504 (2013) and 143, 036101 (2015)]. We\nshow that this discrepancy can be traced back to the use of an incorrect kernel\nin the calculation of the electrostatic field. More seriously, we find that the\nWolf method fails to predict correct molecular orientations, resulting in\ndipole densities with opposite sign to those computed using Ewald summation. By\nconsidering two different multipole expansions, we show that, for inhomogeneous\npolarisations, the quadrupole contribution can be significant and even outweigh\nthe dipole contribution to the field. Finally, we propose a more accurate way\nof calculating the electrostatic potential and the field. In particular, we\nshow that averaging the microscopic field analytically to obtain the\nmacroscopic Maxwell field reduces the error bars by up to an order of\nmagnitude. As a consequence, the simulation times required to reach a given\nstatistical accuracy decrease by up to two orders of magnitude.\n", "  We point out that the observed time delay between the detection of the signal\nat the Hanford and Livingston LIGO sites from the gravitational wave event\nGW150914 places an upper bound on the speed of propagation of gravitational\nwaves, $c_{gw}\\lesssim 1.7$ in the units of speed of light. Combined with the\nlower bound from the absence of gravitational Cherenkov losses by cosmic rays\nthat rules out most of subluminal velocities, this gives a model-independent\ndouble-sided constraint $1\\lesssim c_{gw}\\lesssim 1.7$. We compare this result\nto model-specific constraints from pulsar timing and cosmology.\n", "  Persistent control of a transmon qubit is performed by a feedback protocol\nbased on continuous heterodyne measurement of its fluorescence. By driving the\nqubit and cavity with microwave signals whose amplitudes depend linearly on the\ninstantaneous values of the quadratures of the measured fluorescence field, we\nshow that it is possible to stabilize permanently the qubit in any targeted\nstate. Using a Josephson mixer as a phase-preserving amplifier, it was possible\nto reach a total measurement efficiency $\\eta$=35%, leading to a maximum of 59%\nof excitation and 44% of coherence for the stabilized states. The experiment\ndemonstrates multiple-input multiple-output analog Markovian feedback in the\nquantum regime.\n", "  We present a standard field theoretical derivation of the dynamic density and\nspin linear response functions of a dilute superfluid Fermi gas in the BCS-BEC\ncrossover in both three and two dimensions. The derivation of the response\nfunctions is based on the elegant functional path integral approach which\nallows us to calculate the density-density and spin-spin correlation functions\nby introducing the external sources for the density and the spin density. Since\nthe generating functional cannot be evaluated exactly, we consider two gapless\napproximations which ensure a gapless collective mode (Goldstone mode) in the\nsuperfluid state: the BCS-Leggett mean-field theory and the\nGaussian-pair-fluctuation (GPF) theory. In the mean-field theory, our results\nof the response functions agree with the known results from the random phase\napproximation. We further consider the pair fluctuation effects and establish a\ntheoretical framework for the dynamic responses within the GPF theory. We show\nthat the GPF response theory naturally recover three kinds of famous\ndiagrammatic contributions: the Self-Energy contribution, the Aslamazov-Lakin\ncontribution, and the Maki-Thompson contribution. We also show that unlike the\nequilibrium state, in evaluating the response functions, the linear\n(first-order) terms in the external sources as well as the induced order\nparameter perturbations should be treated carefully. In the superfluid state,\nthere is an additional order parameter contribution which ensures that in the\nstatic and long wavelength limit, the density response function recovers the\nresult of the compressibility (compressibility sum rule). We expect that the\n$f$-sum rule is manifested by the full number equation which includes the\ncontribution from the Gaussian pair fluctuations.\n", "  We have developed an event mixing technique to observe Bose-Einstein\ncorrelations (BEC) between two identical neutral pions produced in\nphoto-induced reactions in the non-perturbative QCD energy region. It is found\nthat the missing-mass consistency cut and the pion-energy cut are essential for\nthe event mixing method to effectively extract BEC observables. A Monte Carlo\n(MC) simulation is used to validate these constraints and confirms the\nefficiency of this method. Our work paves the way for similar BEC studies at\nlower energies where the multiplicity of emitted bosons is limited.\n", "  The Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs) and Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGRs) are a\nclass of pulsars understood as neutron stars (NSs) with super strong surface\nmagnetic fields, namely $B\\gtrsim10^{14}$ G, and for that reason are known as\nMagnetars. However, in the last years some SGRs/AXPs with low surface magnetic\nfields $B\\sim(10^{12}-10^{13})$ G have been detected, challenging the Magnetar\ndescription. Moreover, some fast and very magnetic white dwarfs (WDs) have also\nbeen observed, and at least one showed X-Ray energy emission as an ordinary\npulsar. Following this fact, an alternative model based on white dwarfs pulsars\nhas been proposed to explain this special class of pulsars. In this model, AXPs\nand SGRs as dense and magnetized white dwarfs can have surface magnetic field\n$B\\sim 10^{7}-10^{10}$ G and rotate very fast with frequencies $\\Omega\\sim 1$\nrad/s, consistent with the observed rotation periods $P\\sim (2-12)$ s.\n", "  The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has accumulated a total of 318 billion\ncosmic-ray induced muon events between May 2009 and May 2015. This data set was\nused for a detailed analysis of the cosmic-ray arrival direction anisotropy in\nthe TeV to PeV energy range. The observed global anisotropy features large\nregions of relative excess and deficit, with amplitudes on the order of\n$10^{-3}$ up to about 100 TeV. A decomposition of the arrival direction\ndistribution into spherical harmonics shows that most of the power is contained\nin the low-multipole ($\\ell\\leq 4$) moments. However, higher multipole\ncomponents are found to be statistically significant down to an angular scale\nof less than $10^{\\circ}$, approaching the angular resolution of the detector.\nAbove 100 TeV, a change in the morphology of the arrival direction distribution\nis observed, and the anisotropy is characterized by a wide relative deficit\nwhose amplitude increases with primary energy up to at least 5\\,PeV, the\nhighest energies currently accessible to IceCube. No time dependence of the\nlarge- and small-scale structures is observed in the six-year period covered by\nthis analysis. The high-statistics data set reveals more details on the\nproperties of the anisotropy and is potentially able to shed light on the\nvarious physical processes that are responsible for the complex angular\nstructure and energy evolution.\n", "  We consider different generalizations of the honeycomb lattice to three\ndimensional structures. We address the family of the hyper-honeycomb lattice,\nwhich is made up of alternating layers of 2D honeycomb nano-ribbons, with each\nlayer rotated by $\\pi/2$ with the layer below. When the orbitals of the lattice\nsites are symmetric with respect to the planes of the trigonal links, these\nstructures can produce a Dirac loop, a closed line of Dirac nodes in momentum\nspace. For orbitals that break that symmetry, such as the carbon $p$-wave\norbitals, hyper-honeycomb lattices do not possess the loop structure. We also\nconsider a new structure, the screw hyper-honeycomb, in which the successive\nlayers of parallel units are rotated by $2\\pi/3$. This structure has a Dirac\nloop if reflection symmetry in the unit cell is imposed, regardless the\nsymmetry of the onsite orbitals. We discuss the implementation of those systems\nin optical lattices.\n", "  We solve the Cauchy problem for the Schr\\\"odinger equation corresponding to\nthe family of Hamiltonians $H_{\\gamma(t)}$ in $L^{2}(\\mathbb{R})$ which\ndescribes a $\\delta'$-interaction with time-dependent strength $1/\\gamma(t)$.\nWe prove that the strong solution of such a Cauchy problem exits whenever the\nmap $t\\mapsto\\gamma(t)$ belongs to the fractional Sobolev space\n$H^{3/4}(\\mathbb{R})$, thus weakening the hypotheses which would be required by\nthe known general abstract results. The solution is expressed in terms of the\nfree evolution and the solution of a Volterra integral equation.\n", "  We develop a theory of the local density of states (LDOS) of disordered\nsuperconductors, employing the non-linear sigma-model formalism and the\nrenormalization-group framework. The theory takes into account the interplay of\ndisorder and interaction couplings in all channels, treating the systems with\nshort-range and Coulomb interactions on equal footing. We explore 2D systems\nthat would be Anderson insulators in the absence of interaction and 2D or 3D\nsystems that undergo Anderson transition in the absence of interaction. We\nevaluate both the average tunneling density of states and its mesoscopic\nfluctuations which are related to the LDOS multifractality in normal disordered\nsystems. The obtained average LDOS shows a pronounced depletion around the\nFermi energy, both in the metallic phase (i.e., above the superconducting\ncritical temperature $T_c$) and in the insulating phase near the\nsuperconductor-insulator transition (SIT). The fluctuations of the LDOS are\nfound to be particularly strong for the case of short-range interactions --\nespecially, in the regime when $T_c$ is enhanced by Anderson localization. On\nthe other hand, the long-range Coulomb repulsion reduces the mesoscopic LDOS\nfluctuations. However, also in a model with Coulomb interaction, the\nfluctuations become strong when the systems approaches the SIT.\n", "  We investigate the qualitative features of binary black hole shadows using\nthe model of two extremally charged black holes in static equilibrium (a\nMajumdar--Papapetrou solution). Our perspective is that binary spacetimes are\nnatural exemplars of chaotic scattering, because they admit more than one\nfundamental null orbit, and thus an uncountably-infinite set of perpetual null\norbits which generate scattering singularities in initial data. Inspired by the\nthree-disc model, we develop an appropriate symbolic dynamics to describe\nplanar null geodesics on the double black hole spacetime. We show that a\none-dimensional (1D) black hole shadow may constructed through an iterative\nprocedure akin to the construction of the Cantor set; thus the 1D shadow is\nself-similar. Next, we study non-planar rays, to understand how angular\nmomentum affects the existence and properties of the fundamental null orbits.\nTaking slices through 2D shadows, we observe three types of 1D shadow: regular,\nCantor-like, and highly chaotic. The switch from Cantor-like to regular occurs\nwhere outer fundamental orbits are forbidden by angular momentum. The highly\nchaotic part is associated with an unexpected feature: stable and bounded null\norbits, which exist around two black holes of equal mass $M$ separated by $a_1\n< a < \\sqrt{2} a_1$, where $a_1 = 4M/\\sqrt{27}$. To show how this possibility\narises, we define a certain potential function and classify its stationary\npoints. We conjecture that the highly chaotic parts of the 2D shadow possess\nthe Wada property. Finally, we consider the possibility of following null\ngeodesics through event horizons, and chaos in the maximally-extended\nspacetime.\n", "  We report a study of reversible adsorption of DNA-coated colloids on\ncomplementary functionalized oil droplets. We show that it is possible to\ncontrol the surface coverage of oil droplets by colloidal particles, by\nexploiting the fact that during slow adsorption, compositional arrest takes\nplace well before structural arrest occurs. As a consequence, we can prepare\ncolloid-coated oil droplets with a `frozen' degree of loading, but with fully\nergodic colloidal dynamics on the droplets. We illustrate the equilibrium\nnature of the adsorbed colloidal phase by exploring the quasi two-dimensional\n(2d) phase behaviour of the adsorbed colloids under the influence of depletion\ninteractions. We present simulations of a simple model that illustrates the\nnature of the compositional arrest and the structural ergodicity.\n", "  We present an alternative and more direct construction of the\nnon-supersymmetric D1-D5-P supergravity solutions found by Jejjala, Madden,\nRoss and Titchener. We show that these solutions --- with all three charges and\nboth rotations turned on --- can be viewed as a charged version of the\nMyers-Perry instanton. We present an inverse scattering construction of the\nMyers-Perry instanton metric in Euclidean five-dimensional gravity. The angular\nmomentum bounds in this construction turn out to be precisely the ones\nnecessary for the smooth microstate geometries. We add charges on the\nMyers-Perry instanton using appropriate SO(4,4) hidden symmetry\ntransformations. The full construction can be viewed as an extension and\nsimplification of a previous work by Katsimpouri, Kleinschmidt and Virmani.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of magnetic excitations in Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$\nusing a three band tight binding model that takes into account the influence of\nMn and Ti dopant ions. The effect of dopant ions on the Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ band\nstructure has been included by taking into account the dopant induced\nsuppression of the oxygen octahedral rotation in the tight binding band\nstructure and changes in electron occupation. We find that the low energy spin\nfluctuations are dominated by three wave vectors around\nQ=$((0,0),(\\pi/2,\\pi/2))$, and $(\\pi,0)$ which compete with each other. As the\noctahedral rotation is suppressed with increasing doping, the three wave\nvectors evolve differently. In particular, the undoped compound has dominant\nwavevectors at Q=$((0,0),(\\pi/2,\\pi/2))$, but doping Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ leads to\na significant enhancement in the spin susceptibility at the Q=$(\\pi,0)$\nwavevector bringing the system closer to a magnetic instability. All the\nfeatures calculated from our model are in agreement with neutron scattering\nexperiments. We have also studied the effect of a c-axis Zeeman field on the\nlow energy spin fluctuations. We find that an increasing magnetic field\nsuppresses the AFM fluctuations and leads to stronger competition between the\nAFM and FM spin fluctuations. The magnetic field dependence observed in our\ncalculations therefore supports the scenario that the observed nematic phase in\nthe metamagnetic region in Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ is intimately related to the\npresence of a competing ferromagnetic instability.\n", "  We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of the bond-alternating $S=2$\nquantum spin chain with the $XXZ$ and on-site anisotropies. For the on-site\nanisotropies, in addition to the popular $D_2 \\sum_j (S_j^z)^2$ term, we\nconsider the $D_4 \\sum_j (S_j^z)^4$ term. Mainly we use the exact\ndiagonalization and the level spectroscopy analysis. We show that the Haldane\nstate, large-$D$ state and the Dimer2 state belong to the same trivial phase,\nby finding the existence of adiabatic paths directly connecting these states\nwithout the quantum phase transition. Similarly, we show that the\nintermediate-$D$ state and the Dimer1 state belong to the same symmetry\nprotected topological phase.\n", "  In this work we investigate the transition from kinks to compactons at high\ntemperatures. We deal with a family of models, described by a real scalar field\nwith standard kinematics, controlled by a single parameter, real and positive.\nThe family of models supports kinklike solutions, and the solutions tend to\nbecome compact when the parameter increases to larger and larger values. We\nstudy the one-loop corrections at finite temperature, to see how the thermal\neffects add to the effective potential. The results suggest that the symmetry\nis restored at very high temperatures.\n", "  The exact description of the time evolution of open correlated quantum\nsystems remains one of the major challenges of the condensed matter theory,\nspecially for asymptotic long times where most numerical methods fail. Here,\nthe post-quench dynamics of the $N$-component Bose-Anderson impurity model is\nstudied in the $N\\to\\infty$ limit. The equilibrium phase diagram is similar to\nthat of the Bose-Hubbard model in that it contains local versions of the Mott\nand Bose phases. Using a numerically exact procedure we are able to study the\nreal time evolution including asymptotic long time regimes. The formation of\nlong-lived transient phases is observed for quench paths crossing foreign\nphases. For quenches inside the local Bose condensed phase, a dynamical phase\ntransition is reported, that separates the evolution towards a new equilibrium\nstate and a regime characterized at large times by a persistent phase rotation\nof the order parameter. We explain how such non-decaying mode can exist in the\npresence of a dissipative bath. We discuss the extension of our results to the\nexperimental relevant finite-$N$ case and their implication for the existence\nof non-decaying modes in generic quantum systems in the presence of a bath.\n", "  The simple correlation among three lepton flavor mixing angles\n$(\\theta^{}_{12}, \\theta^{}_{13}, \\theta^{}_{23})$ and the leptonic Dirac\nCP-violating phase $\\delta$ is conventionally called a sum rule of lepton\nflavor mixing, which may be derived from a class of neutrino mass models with\nflavor symmetries. In this paper, we consider the solar lepton mixing sum rule\n$\\theta^{}_{12} \\approx \\theta^{\\nu}_{12} + \\theta^{}_{13} \\cos \\delta$, where\n$\\theta^\\nu_{12}$ stems from a constant mixing pattern in the neutrino sector\nand takes the value of $\\theta^\\nu_{12} = 45^\\circ$ for the bi-maximal mixing\n(BM), $\\theta^\\nu_{12} = \\tan^{-1}(1/\\sqrt{2}) \\approx 35.3^\\circ$ for the\ntri-bimaximal mixing (TBM) or $\\theta^\\nu_{12} = \\tan^{-1}\\left[2/(\\sqrt{5} +\n1)\\right] \\approx 31.7^\\circ$ for the golden-ratio mixing (GR), and investigate\nthe renormalization-group (RG) running effects on lepton flavor mixing\nparameters when this sum rule is assumed at a superhigh-energy scale. For\nillustration, we work within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric\nstandard model (MSSM), and implement the Bayesian approach to explore the\nposterior distribution of $\\delta$ at the low-energy scale, which becomes quite\nbroad when the RG running effects are significant. Moreover, we also discuss\nthe compatibility of the above three mixing scenarios with current neutrino\noscillation data, and observe that radiative corrections can increase such a\ncompatibility for the BM scenario, resulting in a weaker preference for the TBM\nand GR ones.\n", "  We study a system of three photons in an atomic medium coupled to Rydberg\nstates near the conditions of electromagnetically induced transparency. Based\non the analytical analysis of the microscopic set of equations in the\nfar-detuned regime, the effective three-body interaction for these Rydberg\npolaritons is derived. For slow light polaritons, we find a strong three-body\nrepulsion with the remarkable property that three polaritons can become\nessentially non-interacting at short distances. This analysis allows us to\nderive the influence of the three-body repulsion on bound states and\ncorrelation functions of photons propagating through a one-dimensional atomic\ncloud.\n", "  In [1], it is shown that the Rabinovich-Fabrikant (RF) system admits\nself-excited and hidden chaotic attractors. In this paper, we further show that\nthe RF system also admits a pair of symmetric transient hidden chaotic\nattractors. We reveal more extremely rich dynamics of this system, such as a\nnew kind of \"virtual saddles\".\n", "  Prevailing models of resistive switching arising from electrochemical\nformation of conducting filaments across solid state ionic conductors commonly\nattribute the observed polarity of the voltage-biased switching to the sequence\nof the active and inert electrodes confining the resistive switching memory\ncell. Here we demonstrate equivalent, stable switching behavior in metallic\nAg-Ag$_{2}$S-Ag nanojunctions at room temperature. Our experimental results and\nnumerical simulations reveal that the polarity of the switchings is solely\ndetermined by the geometrical asymmetry of the electrode surfaces. By the\nlithographical design of a proof of principle device we demonstrate the merits\nof simplified fabrication of atomic-scale, robust planar Ag$_{2}$S memory\ncells.\n", "  We analyze the two-dimensional CP(N-1) sigma model defined on a finite space\ninterval L, with various boundary conditions, in the large N limit. With the\nDirichlet boundary condition at the both ends, we show that the system has a\nunique phase, which smoothly approaches in the large L limit the standard 2D\nCP(N-1) sigma model in confinement phase, with a constant mass generated for\nthe n(i) fields. We study the full functional saddle-point equations for finite\nL, and solve them numerically. The latter reduces to the well-known gap\nequation in the large L limit. It is found that the solution satisfies actually\nboth the Dirichlet and Neumann conditions.\n", "  We present a novel differential refractive index sensor based on arrays of\nphotonic molecules (PM) of dielectric cylinders and two structural defect\ncavities. The transmission spectrum of the photonic proposed structure as\nsensor shows a wide photonic stop band with two localized states. One of them,\nthe reference state, is bound to a decagonal ring of cylinders and the other,\nthe sensing state, to the defect cavities of the lattice. It is shown that\ndefect mode is very sensitive to the presence of materials with dielectric\npermittivity different from that of the surrounding cylinders while the state\nin the PM is not affected by their presence. This behavior allows to design a\ndevice for sensing applications. A prototype of the sensor, in the microwave\nregion, was built using a matrix of 3x2 PM arrays made of soda-lime glass\ncylinders (dielectric permittivity of 4.5). The transmission spectra was\nmeasured in the microwave range (8-12 GHz) with samples of different refractive\nindex inserted in the defect cavities. Simulations with Finite Integration\ntime-domain Method are in good agreement with experiments. We find that the\nresponse of the sensor is linear. Device measurement range is determined by the\ndielectric constant of the cylinders that make up the device. The results here\npresented in the microwave region can be extrapolated to the visible range due\nto scale invariance of Maxwell equations. This make our prototype a promising\nstructure as sensor also in the optical range.\n", "  Resonant tunneling can lead to inverse tunnel magnetoresistance when impurity\nlevels rather than direct tunneling dominate the transport process. We\nfabricated hybrid magnetic tunnel junctions of CoFe/LiF/EuS/Ti, with an\nepitaxial LiF energy barrier joined with a polycrystalline EuS spin-filter\nbar-rier. Due to the water solubility of LiF, the devices were fully packaged\nin situ. The devices showed sizeable positive TMR up to 16% at low bias\nvoltages but clearly inverted TMR at higher bias voltages. The TMR inversion\ndepends sensitively on the thickness of LiF, and the tendency of inversion\ndisap-pears when LiF gets thick enough and recovers its intrinsic properties.\n", "  We created epitaxial magnetic tunnel junctions of FeCo/MgO/EuS on MgO\nbuffered Si (100). Tunnel magnetoresistance reached up to 64% at 4.2 K. An\nunexpected fast drop of magnetoresistance was recorded for MgO thickness above\n1 nm, which is attributed to the forced nonspecular conductance across the EuS\nconduction band minimum located at the X point, rather than the desired Delta_1\nconductance centered around the Gamma point.\n", "  Bondi accretion assumes that there is a sink of mass at the center -- which\nin case of a black hole (BH) corresponds to the advection of matter across the\nevent horizon. Other stars, such as a neutron star (NS), have surfaces and\nhence the infalling matter has to slow down at the surface. We study the\ninitial value problem in which the matter distribution is uniform and at rest\nat $t=0$. We consider different inner boundary conditions for BHs and NSs:\noutflow boundary condition (mimicking mass sink at the center) valid for BHs;\nand {\\em reflective} and steady-shock (allowing gas to cross the inner boundary\nat subsonic speeds) boundary conditions for NSs. We also obtain a similarity\nsolution for cold accretion on to BHs and NSs. 1-D simulations show the\nformation of an outward propagating and a standing shock in NSs for reflective\nand steady-shock boundary conditions, respectively. Entropy is the highest at\nthe bottom of the subsonic region for reflective boundary conditions. In 2-D\nthis profile is convectively unstable. Using steady-shock inner boundary\nconditions, the flow is unstable to the standing accretion shock instability\n(SASI) in 2-D, which leads to global shock oscillations and may be responsible\nfor quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) seen in the lightcurves of accreting\nsystems. For steady accretion in the quiescent state, spherical accretion rate\non to a NS can be suppressed by orders of magnitude compared to that on to a\nBH.\n", "  Low energy reaction dynamics can strongly depend on the internal structure of\nthe reactants. The role of rotationally inelastic processes in cold collisions\ninvolving polyatomic molecules has not been explored so far. Here we address\nthis problem performing a merged-beam study of the He*+CHF$_3$ Penning\nionization reaction in a range of collision energies $E/k_B$=0.5--120 K. The\nexperimental cross sections are compared with total reaction cross sections\ncalculated within the framework of the quantum defect theory. We find that the\nbroad range of collision energies combined with the relatively small rotational\nconstants of \\chfs makes rotationally inelastic collisions a crucial player in\nthe total reaction dynamics. Quantitative agreement between theory and\nexperiment is only obtained if the energy-dependent probability for rotational\nexcitation is included in the calculations, in stark contrast to previous\nexperiments where classical scaling laws were able to describe the results.\n", "  Finsler geometric surface model is studied as a coarse-grained model for\nmembranes of three-component such as DOPC, DPPC and Cholesterol. To understand\nthe phase separation of liquid ordered (DPPC rich) $L_o$ and the liquid\ndisordered (DOPC rich) $L_d$, we introduce a variable $\\sigma (\\in \\{1,-1\\})$\nin the triangulated surface model. We numerically find that there appear two\ncirculars and stripe domains on the surface and that these two morphologies are\nseparated by a phase transition. The morphological change from the one to the\nother with respect to the variation of the area fraction of $L_o$ is consistent\nwith existing experimental results. This gives us a clear understanding of the\norigin of the line tension energy, which has been used to understand those\nmorphological changes in the three-component membranes. In addition to these\ntwo circulars and stripe domains, raft-like domain and budding domain are also\nobserved, and the corresponding several phase diagrams are obtained. Technical\ndetails of the Finsler geometry modeling are also shown.\n", "  The motion of astronomical bodies and the centre of mass of the system is not\nalways well perceived by students. One of the struggles is the conceptual\nchange of reference frame, which is the same that held back the acceptance of\nthe Heliocentric model over the Geocentric one. To address the question, the\nnotion of centre of mass, motion equations (and their numerical solution for a\nsystem of multiple bodies), and change of referential is introduced. The\ndiscussion is done based on conceptual and real world examples, using the solar\nsystem. Consequently, through the use of simple \"do it yourself\" methods and\nbasic equations, students can debate complex motions, and have a wider and\npotentially effective understanding of physics.\n", "  We present results for the production of a pair of on-shell Z bosons via\ngluon fusion. This process occurs both through the production and decay of the\nHiggs boson, and through continuum production where the Z boson couples to a\nloop of massless quarks or to a massive quark. We calculate the interference of\nthe two processes and its contribution to the cross section up to and including\norder O(alpha_s^3). The two-loop contributions to the amplitude are all known\nanalytically, except for the continuum production through loops of top quarks\nof mass m. The latter contribution is important for the invariant mass of the\ntwo Z bosons, (as measured by the mass of their leptonic decay products, m_4l),\nin a regime where m_4l > 2m because of the contributions of longitudinal\nbosons. We examine all the contributions to the virtual amplitude involving top\nquarks, as expansions about the heavy top quark limit. Comparison with the\nanalytic results, where known, allows us to assess the validity of the heavy\nquark expansion, and it extensions. We give results for the NLO corrections to\nthis interference, including both real and virtual radiation.\n", "  We present a new exactly solvable (classical and quantum) model that can be\ninterpreted as the generalization to the two-dimensional sphere and to the\nhyperbolic space of the two-dimensional anisotropic oscillator with any pair of\nfrequencies $\\omega_x$ and $\\omega_y$. The new curved Hamiltonian ${H}_\\kappa$\ndepends on the curvature $\\kappa$ of the underlying space as a\ndeformation/contraction parameter, and the Liouville integrability of\n${H}_\\kappa$ relies on its separability in terms of geodesic parallel\ncoordinates, which generalize the Cartesian coordinates of the plane. Moreover,\nthe system is shown to be superintegrable for commensurate frequencies\n$\\omega_x: \\omega_y$, thus mimicking the behaviour of the flat Euclidean case,\nwhich is always recovered in the $\\kappa\\to 0$ limit. The additional constant\nof motion in the commensurate case is, as expected, of higher-order in the\nmomenta and can be explicitly deduced by performing the classical factorization\nof the Hamiltonian. The known $1:1$ and $2:1$ anisotropic curved oscillators\nare recovered as particular cases of ${H}_\\kappa$, meanwhile all the remaining\n$\\omega_x: \\omega_y$ curved oscillators define new superintegrable systems.\nFurthermore, the quantum Hamiltonian $\\hat {H}_\\kappa$ is fully constructed and\nstudied by following a quantum factorization approach. In the case of\ncommensurate frequencies, the Hamiltonian $\\hat {H}_\\kappa$ turns out to be\nquantum superintegrable and leads to a new exactly solvable quantum model. Its\ncorresponding spectrum, that exhibits a maximal degeneracy, is explicitly given\nas an analytical deformation of the Euclidean eigenvalues in terms of both the\ncurvature $\\kappa$ and the Planck constant $\\hbar$. In fact, such spectrum is\nobtained as a composition of two one-dimensional (either trigonometric or\nhyperbolic) P\\\"osch-Teller set of eigenvalues.\n", "  We investigate the properties of a variability-selected complete sample of\nAGN in order to identify the mechanisms which cause large amplitude X-ray\nvariability on time scales of years. A complete sample of 24 sources was\nconstructed, from AGN which changed their soft X-ray luminosity by more than\none order of magnitude over 5--20 years between ROSAT observations and the XMM\nSlew Survey. Follow-up observations were obtained with the Swift satellite.\nAfter removal of two probable spurious sources, we find that the sample has\nglobal properties which differ little from a non-varying control sample drawn\nfrom the wider XMM-Slew/ROSAT/Veron sample of all secure AGN detections. A wide\nrange of AGN types are represented in the varying sample. The black hole mass\ndistributions for the varying and non-varying sample are not significantly\ndifferent. This suggests that long timescale variability is not strongly\naffected by black hole mass. There is marginal evidence that the variable\nsources have a lower redshift (2$\\sigma$) and X-ray luminosity (1.7$\\sigma$).\nApart from two radio-loud sources, the sample have normal optical-X-ray ratios\n($\\alpha_{\\rm OX}$) when at their peak but are X-ray weak during their lowest\nflux measurements. Drawing on our results and other studies, we are able to\nidentify a variety of variability mechanisms at play: tidal disruption events,\njet activity, changes in absorption, thermal emission from the inner accretion\ndisc, and variable accretion disc reflection. Little evidence for strong\nabsorption is seen in the majority of the sample and single-component\nabsorption can be excluded as the mechanism for most sources.\n", "  We present results from three-dimensional general relativistic simulations of\nbinary neutron star coalescences and mergers using public codes. We considered\nequal mass models where the baryon mass of the two Neutron Stars (NS) is\n$1.4M_{\\odot}$, described by four different equations of state (EOS) for the\ncold nuclear matter (APR4, SLy, H4, and MS1; all parametrized as piecewise\npolytropes). We started the simulations from four different initial interbinary\ndistances ($40, 44.3, 50$, and $60$ km), including up to the last 16 orbits\nbefore merger. That allows to show the effects on the gravitational wave phase\nevolution, radiated energy and angular momentum due to: the use of different\nEOSs, the orbital eccentricity present in the initial data and the initial\nseparation (in the simulation) between the two stars.\n  Our results show that eccentricity has a major role in the discrepancy\nbetween numerical and analytical waveforms until the very last few orbits,\nwhere \"tidal\" effects and missing high-order post-Newtonian coefficients also\nplay a significant role.\n  We test different methods for extrapolating the gravitational wave signal\nextracted at finite radii to null infinity. We show that an effective procedure\nfor integrating the Newman-Penrose $\\psi_4$ signal to obtain the gravitational\nwave strain $h$ is to apply a simple high-pass digital filter to $h$ after a\ntime domain integration, where only the two physical motivated integration\nconstants are introduced. That should be preferred to the more common\nprocedures of introducing additional integration constants, integrating in the\nfrequency domain or filtering $\\psi_4$ before integration.\n", "  Millimeter sized single crystals of CaFe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$AsF were grown using a\nself-flux method. It is found that high-quality single crystals can be grown\nfrom three approaches with different initial raw materials. The chemical\ncompositions and crystal structure were characterized carefully. The c-axis\nlattice constant is suppressed by the Co substitution. Superconductivity with\nthe critical transition $T_c$ as high as 21 K was confirmed by both the\nresistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements in the sample with $x$ =\n0.12. Moreover, it is found that $T_c$ can be enhanced for about 1 K under the\nvery small hydrostatic pressure of 0.22 GPa, which is more quickly than that\nreported in the polycrystalline samples. Our results is a promotion for the\nphysical investigations of 1111 phase iron-pnictide superconductors.\n", "  We have implemented internally contracted complete active space second order\nperturbation theory (CASPT2) with the density matrix renormalization group\n(DMRG) as active space solver [Y. Kurashige and T. Yanai, J. Chem. Phys. 135,\n094104 (2011)]. Internally contracted CASPT2 requires to contract the\ngeneralized Fock matrix with the 4-particle reduced density matrix (4-RDM) of\nthe reference wavefunction. The required 4-RDM elements can be obtained from\n3-particle reduced density matrices (3-RDM) of different wavefunctions, formed\nby symmetry-conserving single-particle excitations op top of the reference\nwavefunction. In our spin-adapted DMRG code chemps2\n[https://github.com/sebwouters/chemps2], we decompose these excited\nwavefunctions as spin-adapted matrix product states, and calculate their 3-RDM\nin order to obtain the required contraction of the generalized Fock matrix with\nthe 4-RDM of the reference wavefunction. In this work, we study the\nlongitudinal static second hyperpolarizability of all-trans polyenes\nC$_{2n}$H$_{2n+2}$ [n = 4 - 12] in the cc-pVDZ basis set. DMRG-SCF and\nDMRG-CASPT2 yield substantially lower values and scaling with system size\ncompared to RHF and MP2, respectively.\n", "  We solve the orbitally degenerate two-band Hubbard model within dynamical\nmean field theory and map out the instabilities to various symmetry-broken\nphases based on an analysis of the corresponding lattice susceptibilities.\nPhase diagrams as a function of the Hund coupling parameter J are obtained both\nfor the model with rotationally invariant interaction and for the model with\nIsing-type anisotropy. For negative J, an intra-orbital spin-singlet\nsuperconducting phase appears at low temperatures, while the normal state\nproperties are characterized by an orbital freezing phenomenon. This is the\nnegative-J analogue of the recently discovered fluctuating-moment induced\ns-wave spin-triplet superconductivity in the spin-freezing regime of\nmulti-orbital models with J>0.\n", "  We compute the left-right entanglement entropy for Dp-branes in string\ntheory. We employ the CFT approach to string theory Dp-branes, in particular,\nits presentation as coherent states of the closed string sector. The\nentanglement entropy is computed as the von Neumann entropy for a density\nmatrix resulting from integration over the left-moving degrees of freedom. We\ndiscuss various crucial ambiguities related to sums over spin structures and\nargue that different choices capture different physics; however, we advance a\nthemodynamic argument that seems to favor a particular choice of replica. We\nalso consider Dp branes on compact dimensions and verify that the effects of\nT-duality act covariantly on the Dp brane entanglement entropy. We find that\ngenerically the left-right entanglement entropy provides a suitable\ngeneralization of boundary entropy and of the D-brane tension.\n", "  The conceptual design study of a Future Circular hadron-hadron Collider\n(FCC-hh) with a center-of-mass energy of the order of 100 TeV, assumed to be\nconstructed in a new tunnel of 80-100 km circumference, includes the\ndetermination of the basic requirements for its detectors. A superconducting\nsolenoid magnet of 12-m-diameter inner bore with the central magnetic flux\ndensity of 6 T, in combination with two superconducting dipole magnets and two\nconventional toroid magnets is proposed for an FCC-hh experimental setup. The\ncoil of 23.468 m length has seven 3.35-m-long modules included into one\ncryostat. The steel yoke with a mass of 22.6 kt consists of two barrel layers\nof 0.5 m radial thickness and a 0.7-m-thick nose disk and four 0.6-m-thick\nend-cap disks each side. The outer diameter of the yoke is 17.7 m. The full\nlength of the magnetic system is 62.6 m. The air gaps between the end-cap disks\nprovide for the installation of the muon chambers up to an absolute\npseudorapidity about 2.7. The superconducting dipole magnets provide\nmeasurement of charged particle momenta in the absolute pseudorapidity region\ngreater than 3. The conventional forward muon spectrometer allows muon\nidentification in the absolute pseudorapidity region from 2.7 to 5. The magnet\nis modeled with the program TOSCA from Cobham CTS Limited. The total current in\nthe superconducting solenoid coil is 123 MA-turns; the stored energy is 41.8\nGJ. The axial force acting on each end-cap is 450 MN. The stray field is 13.7\nmT at a radius of 50 m from the coil axis, and 5.2 mT at a radius of 100 m.\nMany other parameters are presented and discussed.\n", "  The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) is a general purpose detector, designed to\nrun at the highest luminosity at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Its\ndistinctive features include a 4 T superconducting solenoid with 6-m-diameter\nby 12.5-m-length free bore, enclosed inside a 10,000-ton return yoke made of\nconstruction steel. The return yoke consists of five dodecagonal three-layered\nbarrel wheels and four end-cap disks at each end comprised of steel blocks up\nto 620 mm thick, which serve as the absorber plates of the muon detection\nsystem. To measure the field in and around the steel, a system of 22 flux loops\nand 82 3-D Hall sensors is installed on the return yoke blocks. A TOSCA 3-D\nmodel of the CMS magnet is developed to describe the magnetic field everywhere\noutside the tracking volume measured with the field-mapping machine. The first\nattempt is made to measure the magnetic flux density in the steel blocks of the\nCMS magnet yoke using the standard magnet discharge with the current ramp down\nspeed of 1.5 A/s.\n", "  Modern research in solar physics in Russia is a multifaceted endeavor, which\nincludes multi-wavelength observations from the ground- and space-based\ninstruments, extensive theoretical and numerical modeling studies, new\ninstrument development, and cross-disciplinary and international research. The\nresearch is conducted at the research organizations under the auspices of the\nRussian Academy of Sciences and to a lesser extent, by the research groups at\nUniversities. Here, we review the history of solar physics research in Russia,\nand provide an update on recent developments.\n", "  The observation of a reconstructed Fermi surface via quantum oscillations in\nhole-doped cuprates opened a path towards identifying broken symmetry states in\nthe pseudogap regime. However, such an identification has remained inconclusive\ndue to the multi-frequency quantum oscillation spectra and complications\naccounting for bilayer effects in most studies. We overcome these impediments\nwith high resolution measurements on the structurally simpler cuprate\nHgBa2CuO4+d (Hg1201), which features one CuO2 plane per unit cell. We find only\na single oscillatory component with no signatures of magnetic breakdown\ntunneling to additional orbits. Therefore, the Fermi surface comprises a single\nquasi-two-dimensional pocket. Quantitative modeling of these results indicates\nthat biaxial charge-density-wave within each CuO2 plane is responsible for the\nreconstruction, and rules out criss-crossed charge stripes between layers as a\nviable alternative in Hg1201. Lastly, we determine that the characteristic gap\nbetween reconstructed pockets is a significant fraction of the pseudogap\nenergy.\n", "  We study the conditions of restoring supersymmetry (SUSY) after inflation in\nthe supergravity-based cosmological models with a single chiral superfield and\na quartic stabilization term in the K\\\"ahler potential. Some new, explicit, and\nviable inflationary models satisfying those conditions are found. The\ninflaton's scalar superpartner is dynamically stabilized during and after\ninflation. We also demonstrate a possibility of having small and adjustable\nSUSY breaking with a tiny cosmological constant.\n", "  Recently lead halide nanocrystals (quantum dots) have been reported with\npotential for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications due to their\nexcellent luminescent properties. Herein excitonic photoluminescence (PL)\nexcited by two-photon absorption in perovskite CsPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs) have\nbeen studied across a broad temperature range from 80K to 380K. Two-photon\nabsorption has been investigated with absorption coefficient up to 0.085 cm/GW\nat room temperature. Moreover, the photoluminescence excited by two-photon\nabsorption shows a linear blue-shift (0.25meV/K) below temperature of ~220K and\nturned steady with fluctuation below 1nm (4.4meV) for higher temperature up to\n380K. These phenomena are distinctly different from general red-shift of\nsemiconductor and can be explained by the competition between lattice expansion\nand electron-phonon couplling.Our results reveal the strong nonlinear\nabsorption and temperature-independent chromaticity in a large temperature\nrange from 220K to 380K in the CsPbX3 QDs, which will offer new opportunities\nin nonlinear photonics, light-harvesting and light-emitting devices.\n", "  Integrable N-particle systems have an important property that the associated\nSeiberg-Witten prepotentials satisfy the WDVV equations. However, this does not\napply to the most interesting class of elliptic and double-elliptic systems.\nStudying the commutativity conjecture for theta-functions on the families of\nassociated spectral curves, we derive some other non-linear equations for the\nperturbative Seiberg-Witten prepotential, which turn out to have exactly the\ndouble-elliptic system as their generic solution. In contrast with the WDVV\nequations, the new equations acquire non-perturbative corrections which are\nstraightforwardly deducible from the commutativity conditions. We obtain such\ncorrections in the first non-trivial case of N=3 and describe the structure of\nnon-perturbative solutions as expansions in powers of the flat moduli with\ncoefficients that are (quasi)modular forms of the elliptic parameter.\n", "  Localization and mass spectrum of bosonic and fermionic matter fields of some\nnovel families of asymmetric thick brane configurations generated by deformed\ndefects are investigated. The localization profiles of spin 0, spin 1/2 and\nspin 1 bulk fields are identified for novel matter field potentials supported\nby thick branes with internal structures. The condition for localization is\nconstrained by the brane thickness of each model such that thickest branes\nstrongly induces matter localization. The bulk mass terms for both fermion and\nboson fields are included in the global action as to produce some imprints on\nmass-independent potentials of the Kaluza-Klein modes associated to the\ncorresponding Schr\\\"odinger equations. In particular, for spin 1/2 fermions, a\ncomplete analytical profile of localization is obtained for the four classes of\nsuperpotentials here discussed. Regarding the localization of fermion fields,\nour overall conclusion indicates that thick branes produce a left-right\nasymmetric chiral localization of spin 1/2 particles.\n", "  The Australian Space Eye is a proposed astronomical telescope based on a 6U\nCubeSat platform. The Space Eye will exploit the low level of systematic errors\nachievable with a small space based telescope to enable high accuracy\nmeasurements of the optical extragalactic background light and low surface\nbrightness emission around nearby galaxies. This project is also a demonstrator\nfor several technologies with general applicability to astronomical\nobservations from nanosatellites. Space Eye is based around a 90 mm aperture\nclear aperture all refractive telescope for broadband wide field imaging in the\ni and z bands.\n", "  In [1] a new cosmological model is proposed with no big bang singularity in\nthe past, though past geodesically incomplete. This model starts with an\ninflationary era, follows with a stiff matter dominated period and evolves to\naccelerated expansion in an asymptotically de Sitter regime in a realistic\nfashion. The big bang singularity is replaced by a directional singularity.\nThis singularity cannot be reached by comoving observers, since it would take\nthem an infinite proper time lapse to go back to it. On the contrary, observers\nwith nonzero linear momentum have the singularity at finite proper time in\ntheir past, though arbitrarily large. Hence, the time lapse from the initial\nsingularity can be as long as desired, even infinity, depending on the linear\nmomentum of the observer. This conclusion applies to similar inflationary\nmodels. Due to the interest of these models, we address here the properties of\nsuch singularities.\n", "  It is shown, using results of recent direct numerical simulations, that\nspectral properties of distributed chaos in MHD turbulence with zero mean\nmagnetic field are similar to those of hydrodynamic turbulence. An exception is\nMHD spontaneous breaking of space translational symmetry, when the stretched\nexponential spectrum $\\exp(-k/k_{\\beta})^{\\beta}$ has $\\beta=4/7$.\n", "  Statistical ensembles of networks, i.e., probability spaces of all networks\nthat are consistent with given aggregate statistics, have become instrumental\nin the analysis of complex networks. Their numerical and analytical study\nprovides the foundation for the inference of topological patterns, the\ndefinition of network-analytic measures, as well as for model selection and\nstatistical hypothesis testing. Contributing to the foundation of these data\nanalysis techniques, in this Letter we introduce generalized hypergeometric\nensembles, a broad class of analytically tractable statistical ensembles of\nfinite, directed and weighted networks. This framework can be interpreted as a\ngeneralization of the classical configuration model, which is commonly used to\nrandomly generate networks with a given degree sequence or distribution. Our\ngeneralization rests on the introduction of dyadic link propensities, which\ncapture the degree-corrected tendencies of pairs of nodes to form edges between\neach other. Studying empirical and synthetic data, we show that our approach\nprovides broad perspectives for model selection and statistical hypothesis\ntesting in data on complex networks.\n", "  It is shown that Bogoliubov quasi-averages select the pure or ergodic states\nin the ergodic decomposition of the thermal (Gibbs) state. Our examples include\nquantum spin systems and many-body boson systems. As a consequence, we\nelucidate the problem of equivalence between Bose-Einstein condensation and the\nquasi-average spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) discussed for continuous\nboson systems. The multi-mode extended van den Berg-Lewis-Pul\\'{e} condensation\nof type III demonstrates that the only physically reliable quantities are those\nthat defined by Bogoliubov quasi-averages.\n", "  The recently proposed interior boundary conditions approach [S. Teufel and R.\nTumulka: Avoiding Ultraviolet Divergence by Means of Interior Boundary\nConditions, arXiv:1506.00497] is a method for defining Hamiltonians without UV\ndivergence for quantum field theories. In this approach the interactions\nbetween sectors of the Fock space with different number of particles\n(inter-sector interactions) are obtained by extending the domain of the free\nHamiltonian to include functions with singularities. In this paper a similar\nbut alternative strategy is proposed, in which the inter-sector interactions\nare implemented by specific interaction operators. In its simplest form, an\ninteraction operator is obtained by symmetrizing the asymmetric operator\n$\\|\\hat{\\textbf{x}} \\|^{-1} \\Delta \\|\\hat {\\textbf{x}}\\|^{-1}$. The\ninter-sector interactions derive from the singularities generated by the\nfactors $\\|\\hat{\\textbf{x}}\\|^{-1}$ enclosing the Laplacian, while the domain\nof the interaction operator does not include singular functions. As a\nconsequence the interaction operators and the free Hamiltonian have a common\ndense domain, and they can be added together to form the complete Hamiltonian\nwith interaction.\n", "  Using a synergistic combination of experimental and computational methods, we\nshed light on the unusual solubility of (Cr,Ti)3AlC2 MAX phase, showing that it\nmay accommodate Cr only at very low concentrations (<2at%) or at the exact\nCr/(Cr+Ti) ratio of 2/3, even when the ratio of reactants is far from this\nstoichiometry (1/2 < Cr/(Cr+Ti) < 5/6). In both phases Cr exclusively occupies\nthe 4f sites, bridging carbide layers with the Al layer. Despite this, the\npeculiar stability of (Cr2/3Ti1/3)3AlC2 is attributed to the formation of\nstrong, spin-polarised Cr-C bonds, which result in volume reduction and marked\nincrease in c/a ratio.\n", "  Nonlinearities in finite dimensions can be linearized by projecting them into\ninfinite dimensions. Unfortunately, often the linear operator techniques that\none would then use simply fail since the operators cannot be diagonalized. This\ncurse is well known. It also occurs for finite-dimensional linear operators. We\ncircumvent it by developing a meromorphic functional calculus that can\ndecompose arbitrary functions of nondiagonalizable linear operators in terms of\ntheir eigenvalues and projection operators. It extends the spectral theorem of\nnormal operators to a much wider class, including circumstances in which poles\nand zeros of the function coincide with the operator spectrum. By allowing the\ndirect manipulation of individual eigenspaces of nonnormal and\nnondiagonalizable operators, the new theory avoids spurious divergences. As\nsuch, it yields novel insights and closed-form expressions across several areas\nof physics in which nondiagonalizable dynamics are relevant, including\nmemoryful stochastic processes, open non unitary quantum systems, and\nfar-from-equilibrium thermodynamics.\n  The technical contributions include the first full treatment of arbitrary\npowers of an operator. In particular, we show that the Drazin inverse,\npreviously only defined axiomatically, can be derived as the negative-one power\nof singular operators within the meromorphic functional calculus and we give a\ngeneral method to construct it. We provide new formulae for constructing\nprojection operators and delineate the relations between projection operators,\neigenvectors, and generalized eigenvectors.\n  By way of illustrating its application, we explore several, rather distinct\nexamples.\n", "  Excitation of nonlinear ion acoustic wave (IAW) by an external electric field\nis demonstrated by Vlasov simulation. The frequency calculated by the\ndispersion relation with no damping is verified much closer to the resonance\nfrequency of the small-amplitude nonlinear IAW than that calculated by the\nlinear dispersion relation. When the wave number $ k\\lambda_{De} $ increases,\nthe linear Landau damping of the fast mode (its phase velocity is greater than\nany ion's thermal velocity) increases obviously in the region of $ T_i/T_e <\n0.2 $ in which the fast mode is weakly damped mode. As a result, the deviation\nbetween the frequency calculated by the linear dispersion relation and that by\nthe dispersion relation with no damping becomes larger with $k\\lambda_{De}$\nincreasing. When $k\\lambda_{De}$ is not large, such as $k\\lambda_{De}=0.1, 0.3,\n0.5$, the nonlinear IAW can be excited by the driver with the linear frequency\nof the modes. However, when $k\\lambda_{De}$ is large, such as\n$k\\lambda_{De}=0.7$, the linear frequency can not be applied to exciting the\nnonlinear IAW, while the frequency calculated by the dispersion relation with\nno damping can be applied to exciting the nonlinear IAW.\n", "  A new method of probing Lorentz invariance in the neutron sector is\ndescribed. The method is baed on stable quartz bulk acoustic wave oscillators\ncompared on a rotating table. Due to Lorentz-invariance violation, the\nresonance frequencies of acoustic wave resonators depend on the direction in\nspace via a corresponding dependence of masses of the constituent elements of\nsolids. This dependence is measured via observation of oscillator phase noise\nbuilt around such devices. The first such experiment now shows sensitivity to\nviolation down to the limit $\\tilde{c}^n_Q=(-1.8\\pm2.2)\\times 10^{-14}$ GeV.\nMethods to improve the sensitivity are described together with some other\napplications of the technology in tests of fundamental physics.\n", "  We discuss a 4[k/2]-dimensional complete hyperk\\\"ahler submanifold of the\n(4k-4)-dimensional moduli space of strongly centred SU(2)-monopoles of charge\nk.\n", "  The $K^+\\rightarrow \\pi^+ \\nu \\bar \\nu$ decay is theoretically one of the\ncleanest meson decays and so a good place to look for indirect effects of new\nphysics complementary to LHC searches. The NA62 experiment at CERN is designed\nto measure the branching ratio of this decay with 10\\% precision. NA62 was\ncommissioned in October 2014, took data in pilot runs in 2014 and 2015. The\nNA62 experimental setup is illustrated and data quality is reported.\n", "  Since Hubble and Lamaitre's discovery of the expanding universe using\ngalaxies till the recent discovery of the accelerating universe using standard\ncandles, direct measurements of the evolution of the scale factor of the\nuniverse a(t) have played central roles in establishing the standard model of\ncosmology. In this letter, we show that such a measurement may be extended to\nthe primordial universe using massive fields as standard clocks, providing a\ndirect evidence for the scenario responsible for the Big Bang. This is a short\nand non-technical introduction to the idea of classical and quantum primordial\nstandard clocks.\n", "  The correlation matrices or tensors in the Bloch representation of density\nmatrices are encoded with entanglement properties. In this paper, based on the\nBloch representation of density matrices, we give some new separability\ncriteria for bipartite and multipartite quantum states. Theoretical analysis\nand some examples show that the proposed criteria can be more efficient than\nthe previous related criteria.\n", "  Gauge/gravity duality is the conjecture that string theories have dual\ndescriptions as gauge theories. Weakly-coupled gravity is dual to\nstrongly-coupled gauge theories, ideal for lattice calculations. I will show\nprecision lattice calculations that confirm large-N continuum D0-brane quantum\nmechanics correctly reproduces the leading-order supergravity prediction for a\nblack hole's internal energy---the first leading-order test of the\nduality---and constrains stringy corrections.\n", "  Near-boundary Brownian motion is a classic hydrodynamic problem of great\nimportance in a variety of fields, from biophysics to micro-/nanofluidics.\nHowever, due to challenges in experimental measurements of near-boundary\ndynamics, the effect of interfaces on Brownian motion has remained elusive.\nHere, we report a computational study of this effect using microsecond-long\nlarge-scale molecular dynamics simulations and our newly developed Green-Kubo\nrelation for friction at the liquid-solid interface. Our computer experiment\nunambiguously reveals that the t^(-3/2) long-time decay of the velocity\nautocorrelation function of a Brownian particle in bulk liquid is replaced by a\nt^(-5/2) decay near a boundary. We discover a general breakdown of traditional\nno-slip boundary condition at short time scales and we show that this breakdown\nhas a profound impact on the near-boundary Brownian motion. Our results\ndemonstrate the potential of Brownian-particle based micro-/nano-sonar to probe\nthe local wettability of liquid-solid interfaces.\n", "  We study the hardness of the dihedral hidden subgroup problem. It is known\nthat lattice problems reduce to it, and that it reduces to random subset sum\nwith density $> 1$ and also to quantum sampling subset sum solutions. We\nexamine a decision version of the problem where the question asks whether the\nhidden subgroup is trivial or order two. The decision problem essentially asks\nif a given vector is in the span of all coset states. We approach this by first\ncomputing an explicit basis for the coset space and the perpendicular space. We\nthen look at the consequences of having efficient unitaries that use this\nbasis. We show that if a unitary maps the basis to the standard basis in any\nway, then that unitary can be used to solve random subset sum with constant\ndensity $>1$. We also show that if a unitary can exactly decide membership in\nthe coset subspace, then the collision problem for subset sum can be solved for\ndensity $>1$ but approaching $1$ as the problem size increases. This\nstrengthens the previous hardness result that implementing the optimal POVM in\na specific way is as hard as quantum sampling subset sum solutions.\n", "  Difference sets are basic combinatorial structures that have applications in\nsignal processing, coding theory, and cryptography. We consider the problem of\nidentifying a shifted version of the characteristic function of a (known)\ndifference set. We present a generic quantum algorithm that can be used to\ntackle any hidden shift problem for any difference set in any abelian group. We\ndiscuss special cases of this framework where the resulting quantum algorithm\nis efficient. This includes: a) Paley difference sets based on quadratic\nresidues in finite fields, which allows to recover the shifted Legendre\nfunction quantum algorithm, b) Hadamard difference sets, which allows to\nrecover the shifted bent function quantum algorithm, and c) Singer difference\nsets based on finite geometries. The latter class allows us to define instances\nof the dihedral hidden subgroup problem that can be efficiently solved on a\nquantum computer.\n", "  In the context of critical applications, such as shielding and radiation\nprotection, ensuring the quality of simulation software they depend on is of\nutmost importance. The assessment of simulation software quality is important\nnot only to determine its adoption in experimental applications, but also to\nguarantee reproducibility of outcome over time.\n  In this study, we present initial results from an ongoing analysis of Geant4\ncode based on established software metrics. The analysis evaluates the current\nstatus of the code to quantify its characteristics with respect to documented\nquality standards; further assessments concern evolutions over a series of\nrelease distributions. We describe the selected metrics that quantify software\nattributes ranging from code complexity to maintainability, and highlight what\nmetrics are most effective at evaluating radiation transport software quality.\nThe quantitative assessment of the software is initially focused on a set of\nGeant4 packages, which play a key role in a wide range of experimental\napplications and are representative of different software development\nprocesses. We provide an interpretation of the data resulting from measurements\non the selected Geant4 packages, and discuss methods to improve them.\n  This work can be used as a baseline for evaluating correlations between\nsoftware quality embedded in the Geant4 development process and simulation\nobservables produced by Geant4-based applications. The result provide\nconstructive guidance both to improve key software tools, such as Geant4, and\nto estimate their contribution in risk analyses concerning sensitive\napplications.\n", "  Socially relevant situations that involve strategic interactions are\nwidespread among animals and humans alike. To study these situations,\ntheoretical and experimental works have adopted a game-theoretical perspective,\nwhich has allowed to obtain valuable insights about human behavior. However,\nmost of the results reported so far have been obtained from a population\nperspective and considered one specific conflicting situation at a time. This\nmakes it difficult to extract conclusions about the consistency of individuals'\nbehavior when facing different situations, and more importantly, to define a\ncomprehensive classification of the strategies underlying the observed\nbehaviors. Here, we present the results of a lab-in-the-field experiment in\nwhich subjects face four different dyadic games, with the aim of establishing\ngeneral behavioral rules dictating individuals' actions. By analyzing our data\nwith an unsupervised clustering algorithm, we find that all the subjects\nconform, with a large degree of consistency, to a limited number of behavioral\nphenotypes (Envious, Optimist, Pessimist, and Trustful), with only a small\nfraction of undefined subjects. We also discuss the possible connections to\nexisting interpretations based on a priori theoretical approaches. Our findings\nprovide a relevant contribution to the experimental and theoretical efforts\ntowards the identification of basic behavioral phenotypes in a wider set of\ncontexts without aprioristic assumptions regarding the rules or strategies\nbehind actions. From this perspective, our work contributes to a fact-based\napproach to the study of human behavior in strategic situations, that could be\napplied to simulating societies, policy-making scenario building and even for a\nvariety of business applications.\n", "  Solicited public opinion surveys reach a limited subpopulation of willing\nparticipants and are expensive to conduct, leading to poor time resolution and\na restricted pool of expert-chosen survey topics. In this study, we demonstrate\nthat unsolicited public opinion polling through sentiment analysis applied to\nTwitter correlates well with a range of traditional measures, and has\npredictive power for issues of global importance. We also examine Twitter's\npotential to canvas topics seldom surveyed, including ideas, personal feelings,\nand perceptions of commercial enterprises. Two of our major observations are\nthat appropriately filtered Twitter sentiment (1) predicts President Obama's\njob approval three months in advance, and (2) correlates well with surveyed\nconsumer sentiment. To make possible a full examination of our work and to\nenable others' research, we make public over 10,000 data sets, each a\nseven-year series of daily word counts for tweets containing a frequently used\nsearch term.\n", "  The wave equation $\\square_{g_{M,a}}\\psi=0$ on subextremal Kerr spacetimes\n$(\\mathcal{M}_{M,a},g_{M,a})$, $0<|a|<M$, does not admit real mode solutions,\nas was established by Shlapentokh-Rothman. In this paper, we show that the\nabsence of real modes does not persist under the addition of an arbitrary\nshort-range non-negative potential $V$ to the wave equation or under changes of\nthe metric $g_{M,a}$ in the far away region of $\\mathcal{M}_{M,a}$ (retaining\nthe causality of $T$ there).\n  In particular, we first establish, for any $0<|a|<M$, the existence of real\nmode solutions $\\psi$ to equation $\\square_{g_{M,a}}\\psi-V\\psi=0$, for a\nsuitably chosen time-independent real potential $V$ with compact support in\nspace, satisfying $V\\ge0$. Exponentially growing modes are also obtained after\nperturbing the potential $V$. Then, as an application of the above result, we\nconstruct a family of spacetimes $(\\mathcal{M}_{M,a},g_{M,a}^{(def)})$ which\nare compact in space perturbations of $(\\mathcal{M}_{M,a},g_{M,a})$, have the\nsame symmetries as $(\\mathcal{M}_{M,a},g_{M,a})$ and moreover admit real and\nexponentially growing modes. These spacetimes contain stably trapped null\ngeodesics, but we also construct a more complicated family of spacetimes with\nnormally hyperbolic trapped set, admitting real and exponentially growing\nmodes, at the expense of having conic asymptotics.\n  The above results are in contrast with the case of stationary asymptotically\nflat (or conic) spacetimes $(\\mathcal{M},g)$ with a globally timelike Killing\nfield $T$, where real modes for equation $\\square_{g}\\psi-V\\psi=0$ are always\nabsent, giving a useful zero-frequency continuity criterion for showing\nstability for a smooth family of equations $\\square_{g}\\psi-V_{\\lambda}\\psi=0$,\nwith $\\lambda\\in[0,1]$ and $V_{0}=0$. We show explicitly that this criterion\nfails on Kerr spacetime.\n", "  Based on observations of HII regions and the new computations of the\nrecombination coefficients of the He I lines by Porter et al. (2013) we obtain\na primordial helium abundance by mass of $Y_P = 0.2446\\pm0.0029$. We consider\nthirteen sources of error for the $Y_P$ determination, some of them are mainly\ndue to systematic effects, while the rest are mainly due to statistical\neffects. We compare our results with other determinations of $Y_P$ present in\nthe literature. Combining our $Y_P$ value with computations of primordial\nnucleosynthesis we find a number of neutrino species $N_{eff} = 2.90\\pm0.22$,\nand a neutron mean life $\\tau_{\\nu} = 872\\pm14(s)$.\n", "  In this research, the height, curvature and velocity of the bubble tip in\nRayleigh-Taylor instability at arbitrary Atwood number with horizontal magnetic\nfield are investigated. To support the earlier simulation and experimental\nresults, the vorticity generation inside the bubble is introduced. It is found\nthat, in early nonlinear stage, the temporal evolution of the bubble tip\nparameters depend essentially on the strength and initial perturbation of the\nmagnetic field, although the asymptotic nature coincides with the non magnetic\ncase. The model proposed here agrees with the previous linear, nonlinear and\nsimulation observations.\n", "  We study the thermal evolution of neutron stars in the presence of hyperons\nor kaons in the core. Our results indicate that the nucleon and hyperon direct\nUrca processes play crucial roles for the cooling of neutron stars. The\npresence of hyperons drives fast cooling mechanisms in two ways: 1) it allows\nthe hyperon direct Urca prior to the nucleon direct Urca, 2) and it makes the\nnucleon direct Urca more feasible by reducing the neutron Fermi momentum. We\nfound that the neutron star equation of state (EOS) with hyperons can be\nconsistent with both mass and temperature observations. We also found that the\nneutron star EOS with kaon condensation can be consistent with observations,\neven though the cooling behavior is seldom useful to identify or isolate the\neffect of kaon condensation.\n", "  The energy density is the prime parameter to define the deconfinement of\nquarks and gluons occurring in collisions of heavy ions. Recently, there is\nmounting evidence that many observables in proton-proton collisions behave in a\nmanner very similar to the one observed in heavy ions. We present as an\nadditional piece of evidence, a scaling of the strange particle yields as a\nfunction of the energy density of the three collision systems: p+p p+Pb and\nPb+Pb, using the latest results of the ALICE collaboration.\n", "  Unusual optoelectronic properties of diamondoids produce some discrepancies\nbetween experiments and the outstanding many-body calculation outputs.\nTherefore, many theoretical efforts are attracted to resolve these\ninconsistencies. Here first, by combining time-dependent density functional\ntheory (TD-DFT) and Franck-Condon (FC) approximation, the effect of\nelectron-phonon (e-ph) interaction on the optical gap (OG) of the smallest\ndiamondoids and one of its derivatives is studied. Then, the surface effects on\nthe e-ph coupling and the optical properties of these structures in a\ncomparative manner are considered. We show that the collective motion of\ncarbons modifies the previous OG of adamantane predicted by TD-DFT technique.\nThe introduction of this effect can also fully explain the overestimated gap\npredicted by the diffusion quantum Monte-Carlo (DMC) method. In addition, we\nshow that the chemistry of the surface is another noticeable effect that can\ninfluence the OG renormalization and the spectral lineshape of the system.\n", "  Enhancing the critical temperature (TC) is important not only to the\npractical applications but also to the theories of superconductivity. MgB2 is a\ntype II superconductor with a TC of 39 K, which is very close to the McMillan\nlimit. Improving the TC of MgB2 is challenging but significant. Inspired by the\nmetamaterial structure, we designed a smart meta-superconductor that consists\nof MgB2 microparticles and Y2O3:Eu3+ nanorods. In the local electric field,\nY2O3:Eu3+ nanorods will generate electroluminescence (EL) that can excite MgB2\nparticles, thereby improving the TC by strengthening the electron-phonon\ninteraction. Each MgB2-based superconductor doped with one of the four dopants\nof different EL intensities was prepared by an ex-situ process. The results\nshowed that the addition of Y2O3:Eu3+ brings about an impurity effect that\ndecreases the TC and an EL exciting effect that increases the TC. Apart from\nthe EL intensity, the micro-morphology and degree of dispersion of the dopants\nalso affected the TC. This smart meta-superconductor provides a new method for\nincreasing TC.\n", "  Based on the scattering matrix theory and non-equilibrium green function\nmethod, we have investigated the fluctuations of charge and spin current of the\nsystems which consists of a quantum dot (QD) with a resonant level coupled to\ntwo semiconductor contacts within in alternative site $(AS)$ and alternative\nbond $(AB)$ framework, where two transverse $(B_x)$ and longitudinal $(B_z)$\nmagnetic fields are applied to the QD. It is only necessary to use the\nauto-correlation function to characterize the fluctuations of charge current\nfor a two-terminal system because of the relation which is defined as\n$\\sum_{\\alpha}^e S_{\\alpha\\beta}$ = $\\sum_{\\beta}^e S_{\\alpha\\beta}=0$. Our\nresult shows that both auto-shot noise $(S_{LL})$ and cross-shot noise\n$(S_{LR})$ are essential to characterize the fluctuations of spin current when\n$B_x$ is present. Moreover, our model calculations show that the sign of the\ncross-shot noise of spin current is negative for all surface states of AS/QD/AS\njunctions, while it oscillates between positive and negative values for two\nsurface states of AB/QD/AB junctions as we sweep the gate voltage.\n", "  Organic-inorganic halide perovskite materials have emerged as attractive\nalternatives to conventional solar cell building blocks. Their high light\nabsorption coefficients and long diffusion lengths suggest high power\nconversion efficiencies (PCE),1-5 and indeed perovskite-based single band gap\nand tandem solar cell designs have yielded impressive performances.1-16 One\napproach to further enhance solar spectrum utilization is the graded band gap,\nbut this has not been previously achieved for perovskites. In this study, we\ndemonstrate graded band gap perovskite solar cells with steady-state conversion\nefficiencies averaging 18.4%, with a best of 21.7%, all without reflective\ncoatings. An analysis of the experimental data yields high fill factors of ~75%\nand high short circuit current densities up to 42.1 mA/cm2. These cells, which\nare based on a novel architecture of two perovskite layers (MASnI3 and\nMAPbI3-xBrx), incorporating GaN, monolayer hexagonal boron nitride, and\ngraphene aerogel, display the highest efficiency ever reported for perovskite\nsolar cells.\n", "  We analyze the joint distributions and temporal correlations between the\npartial maximum $m$ and the global maximum $M$ achieved by a Brownian Bridge on\nthe subinterval $[0,t_1]$ and on the entire interval $[0,t]$, respectively. We\ndetermine three probability distribution functions: The joint distribution\n$P(m,M)$ of both maxima; the distribution $P(m)$ of the partial maximum; and\nthe distribution $\\Pi(G)$ of the gap between the maxima, $G = M-m$. We present\nexact results for the moments of these distributions and quantify the temporal\ncorrelations between $m$ and $M$ by calculating the Pearson correlation\ncoefficient.\n", "  In this paper, we give a review of three hohlraum geometries, including\ncylindrical, octahedral and six-cylinder-port hohlraums, in inertial\nconfinement fusion (ICF) mainly from theoretical side. Every hohlraum has its\nown strengths and weaknesses. Although there is a problem of drive asymmetry in\nthe cylindrical hohlraums due to some non-ideal factors, the success of\nignition is still possible if more laser energy is available beyond the US\nNational Ignition Facility (NIF) in the future. Octahedral hohlraums can\nprovide the high symmetry flux on capsule. However, octahedral hohlraums suffer\nfrom several problems due to the complicated three-dimensional plasma\nconditions inside. And up to now, there is no one target design with the\noctahedral hohlraums in which each problem can be solved at the same time.\nSix-cylinder-port hohlraums combine the merits in theory of both cylindrical\nand octahedral hohlraums to a certain extent. We introduce a target design with\ngood performance by using the six-cylinder-port hohlraums, in which the key\nissues of concern, such as laser energy, drive symmetry, and laser plasma\ninteraction (LPI), etc, are all balanced.\n", "  We study the longitudinal relaxation of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center\nsurrounded by a $^{13}$C nuclear spin bath in diamond. By means of\ncluster-correlation expansion (CCE), we numerically demonstrate the decay\nprocess of electronic state induced by cross relaxation at low temperature. It\nis shown that the CCE method is not only capable of describing pure-dephasing\neffect at large-detuning regime, but it can also simulate the quantum dynamics\nof populations in the nearly resonant regime. We present a proposal to slow\ndown the decay of NV center via implementing quantum Zeno effect (QZE). The\nnumerical result shows that QZE can effectively inhibit the decay of NV center.\n", "  The partition function for the random walk of an electrostatic field produced\nby several static parallel infinite charged planes in which the charge\ndistribution could be either $\\pm\\sigma$ is obtained. We find the electrostatic\nenergy of the system and show that it can be analyzed through generalized Dyck\npaths. The relation between the electrostatic field and generalized Dyck paths\nallows us to sum over all possible electrostatic field configurations and is\nused for obtaining the partition function of the system. We illustrate our\nresults with one example.\n", "  Thin liquid films are central to everyday life. They are ubiquitous in modern\ntechnology (pharmaceuticals, coatings), consumer products (foams, emulsions)\nand also serve vital biological functions (tear film of the eye, pulmonary\nsurfactants in the lung). A common feature in all these examples is the\npresence of surface-active molecules at the air-liquid interface. Though they\nform only molecularly-thin layers, these surfactants produce complex surface\nstresses on the free surface, which have important consequences for the\ndynamics and stability of the underlying thin liquid film. Here we conduct\nsimple thinning experiments to explore the fundamental mechanisms that allow\nthe surfactant molecules to slow the gravity-driven drainage of the underlying\nfilm. We present a simple model that works for both soluble and insoluble\nsurfactant systems. We show that surfactants with finite surface rheology\ninfluence bulk flow through viscoelastic interfacial stresses, while\nsurfactants with inviscid surfaces achieve stability through opposing\nsurface-tension induced Marangoni flows.\n", "  The African Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network (AVN) is a pan-African\nproject that will develop Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observing\ncapability in several countries across the African continent, either by\nconversion of existing telecommunications antennas into radio telescopes, or by\nbuilding new ones. This paper focuses on the conversion of the Nkutunse\nsatellite communication station (near Accra, Ghana), specifically the early\nmechanical and infrastructure upgrades, together with the development of a\ncustom ambient receiver and digital backend. The paper concludes with what\nremains to be done, before the station can be commissioned as an operational\nVLBI station.\n", "  I present an example of how to analytically optimize a multiscale\nentanglement renormalization ansatz for a finite antiferromagnetic Heisenberg\nchain. For this purpose, a quantum-circuit representation is taken into\naccount, and we construct the exactly entangled ground state so that a trivial\nIR state is modified sequentially by operating separated entangler layers\n(monodromy operators) at each scale. The circuit representation allows us to\nmake a simple understanding of close relationship between the entanglement\nrenormalization and quantum integrability. We find that the entangler should\nmatch with the $R$-matrix, not a simple unitary, and also find that the\noptimization leads to the mapping between the Bethe roots and the Daubechies\nwavelet coefficients.\n", "  It is well known that jammed soft materials will flow if sheared above their\nyield stress - think mayonnaise spread on bread - but a complete microscopic\ndescription of this seemingly sim- ple process has yet to emerge. What remains\nelusive is a microscopic framework that explains the macroscopic flow, derived\nfrom a 3-D spatially resolved analysis of the dynamics of the droplets or\nparticles that compose the soft material. By combining confocal-rheology\nexperiments on compressed emulsions and numerical simulations, we unravel that\nthe primary microscopic mechanisms for flow are strongly influenced by the rate\nof the imposed deformation. When shearing fast, small coordinated clusters of\ndroplets move collectively as in a conga line, while at low rates the flow\nemerges from bursts of droplet rearrangements, correlated over large domains.\nThese regions exhibit complex spatio-temporal correlation patterns that reflect\nthe long range elasticity embedded in the jammed material. These results\nidentify the three-dimensional structure of microscopic rearrangements within\nsheared soft solids, revealing that the characteristic shape and dynamics of\nthese structures are strongly determined by the rate of the external shear.\n", "  We study the spin resonance peak in recently discovered iron-based\nsuperconductors. The resonance peak observed in inelastic neutron scattering\nexperiments agrees well with predicted results for the extended $s$-wave\n($s_\\pm$) gap symmetry. Recent neutron scattering measurements show that there\nis a disparity between longitudinal and transverse components of the dynamical\nspin susceptibility. Such breaking of the spin-rotational invariance in the\nspin-liquid phase can occur due to spin-orbit coupling. We study the role of\nthe spin-orbit interaction in the multiorbital model for Fe-pnictides and show\nhow it affects the spin resonance feature.\n", "  Artificial micro and nano machines have been envisioned and demonstrated as\npotential candidates for variety of applications, ranging from targeted drug or\ngene delivery, cell manipulation, environmental sensing and many more. Here, we\ndemonstrate the application of helical nanomachines that can measure and map\nthe local rheological properties of a complex heterogeneous environment. The\nposition of the helical nanomachine was controlled precisely using magnetic\nfields, while the instantaneous orientation provided an estimation of the\nviscosity of the surrounding medium with high spatial and temporal accuracy.\nApart from providing viscosity estimates in purely viscous and viscoelastic\nmedia with shear rate independent viscosity (Boger fluids), their motion was\nalso found to be extremely sensitive to fluid elasticity. Taken together we\nreport a promising new technique of mapping the rheological properties of a\ncomplex fluidic environment by helical nanomachines with high spatial and\ntemporal resolutions, a functionality that goes beyond the capabilities of\nexisting passive and active microrheological methods.\n", "  In this paper, a developed Hartree-Fock semiclassical approximation is used\nto calculate the temperature and interaction dependence of the moment of\ninertia of a rotating condensate Boson gas. A fully classical and quantum\nmechanical treatment for the moment of inertia are given in terms of the\nnormalized temperature. We found that the moment of inertia is considerably\naffected by the interaction. The present analysis, shows that the superfluid\neffects in the moment of inertia of a condensate Boson gas can be observed at\ntemperatures $T > .25 T_0 $ and not dramatically smaller than $T_0$.\n", "  On 2015 February 21, simultaneous observations of Jupiter's decametric radio\nemission between 10 and 33 MHz were carried out using three powerful\nlow-frequency radio telescopes: Long Wavelength Array Station One (LWA1) in\nUSA; Nan\\c{c}ay Decameter Array (NDA) in France; and URAN2 telescope in\nUkraine. We measure lag times of short-bursts (S-bursts) for 105-minutes of\ndata over effective baselines up to 8460 km by using cross-correlation analysis\nof the spectrograms from each instrument. Of particular interest is the\nmeasurement of the beaming thickness of S-bursts, testing if either flashlight-\nor beacon-like beaming is emanating from Jupiter. We find that the lag times\nfor all pairs drift slightly as time elapses, in agreement with expectations\nfrom the flashlight-like beaming model. This leads to a new constraint of the\nminimum beaming thickness of 2.66\". Also, we find that most of the analyzed\ndata abound with S-bursts, whose occurrence probability peaks at 17-18 MHz.\n", "  Single-year spikes in radiocarbon production are caused by intense bursts of\nradiation from space. Supernovae emit both high-energy particle and\nelectromagnetic radiation, but it is the latter that is most likely to strike\nthe atmosphere all at once and cause a surge in 14C production. In the 1990s,\nit was claimed that the supernova in 1006 CE produced exactly this effect. With\nthe 14C spikes in the years 775 and 994 CE now attributed to extreme solar\nevents, attention has returned to the question of whether historical supernovae\nare indeed detectable using annual 14C measurements. Here, we combine new and\nexisting measurements over six documented and putative supernovae, and conclude\nthat no such astrophysical event has yet left a distinct imprint on the past\natmospheric 14C record.\n", "  Using a novel transformation involving the Jacobi Last Multiplier (JLM) we\nderive an old integrability criterion due to Chiellini for the Li\\'enard\nequation. By combining the Chiellini condition for integrability and Jacobi's\nLast Multiplier the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian of the Li\\'enard equation is\nderived. We also show that the Kukles equation is the only equation in the\nLi\\'enard family which satisfies both the Chiellini integrability and the\nSabatini criterion for isochronicity conditions. In addition we examine this\nresult by mapping the Li\\'enard equation to a harmonic oscillator equation\nusing tacitly Chiellini's condition. Finally we provide a metriplectic and\ncomplex Hamiltonian formulation of the Li\\'enard equation through the use of\nChiellini condition for integrability.\n", "  Using the Chiellini condition for integrability we derive explicit solutions\nfor a generalized system of Riccati equations $\\ddot{x}+\\alpha\nx^{2n+1}\\dot{x}+x^{4n+3}=0$ by reduction to the first-order Abel equation\nassuming the parameter $\\alpha\\ge 2\\sqrt{2(n+1)}$. The technique, which was\nproposed by Harko \\textit{et al}, involves use of an auxiliary system of\nfirst-order differential equations sharing a common solution with the Abel\nequation. In the process analytical proofs of some of the conjectures made\nearlier on the basis of numerical investigations in \\cite{SJKB} is provided.\n", "  We consider voltage and current responses formation in DC SQUID with\noverdamped Josephson junctions in resistive and superconducting state in the\nframe of resistively shunted junction (RSJ) model. For simplicity we neglect\nthe junction capacitance and the noise effect. Explicit expressions for the\nresponses in resistive state were obtained for a SQUID which is symmetrical\nwith respect to bias current injection point. Normalized SQUID inductance $l =\n2 e I_c L/\\hbar$ (where $I_c$ is the critical current of Josephson junction,\n$L$ is the SQUID inductance, $e$ is the electron charge and $\\hbar$ is the\nPlanck constant) was assumed to be within the range $l \\leq 1$, subsequently\nexpanded up to $l \\approx 7$ using two fitting parameters. SQUID current\nresponse in superconducting state was considered for arbitrary value of the\ninductance. Impact of small technological spread of parameters relevant for\nlow-temperature superconductor (LTS) technology was studied with generalization\nof the developed analytical approach for a case of small difference of critical\ncurrents and shunt resistances of the Josephson junctions, and inequality of\nSQUID inductive shoulders for both resistive and superconducting states.\nComparison with numerical calculation results shows that developed analytical\nexpressions can be used in practical LTS SQUIDs and SQUID-based circuits\ndesign, e.g. large serial SQIF, drastically decreasing the time of simulation.\n", "  A common form of competition is one where judges grade contestants'\nperformances which are then compiled to determine the final ranking of the\ncontestants. Unlike in another common form of competition where two contestants\nplay a head-to-head match to produce a winner as in football or basketball, the\nobjectivity of judges are prone to be questioned, potentially undermining the\npublic's trust in the fairness of the competition. In this work we show, by\nmodeling the judge--contestant competition as a weighted bipartite network, how\nwe can identify biased scores and measure their impact on our inference of the\nnetwork structure. Analyzing the prestigious International Chopin Piano\nCompetition of 2015 with a well-publicized scoring controversy as an example,\nwe show that even a single statistically uncharacteristic score can be enough\nto gravely distort our inference of the community structure, demonstrating the\nimportance of detecting and eliminating biases. In the process we also find\nthat there does not exist a significant system-wide bias of the judges based on\nthe the race of the contestants.\n", "  In the quest of understanding significant variations in the physical,\nchemical and electronic properties of the novel functional materials, low\ntemperature Synchrotron X-ray Diffraction (LT-SXRD) measurements on CTO (a\ntype-II) and CMTO (a type-I) multiferroics are presented. Magnetic phase\ndiagram of CTO shows multiple magnetic transitions at zero fields, whereas, in\nCMTO, 20 K enhancement in the antiferromagnetic transition temperature is\nobserved followed by near room temperature Griffiths phase. Rietveld analysis\non LT-SXRD data of both the samples indicates important observations. For both\nCTO and CMTO, the magnetic anomalies are followed by structural anomalies,\nwhich is a clear signature of spin lattice coupling and the positive shift of\nspin lattice coupling from CTO to CMTO.\n", "  We propose a new truncation scheme for Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon\n(BBGKY) hierarchy. We approximate the three particle distribution function\n$f_{3}(1,2,3,t)$ in terms of $f_{2}(1,2,t)$, $f_{1}(3,t)$ and two point\ncorrelation functions $\\left\\lbrace g_{2}(1,3,t), g_{2}(2,3,t)\\right\\rbrace $.\nFurther $f_{2}$ is expressed in terms of $f_{1}(1,t)$ and $g_{2}(1,2,t)$ to\nclose the hierarchy, resulting a set of coupled kinetic equations for $f_{1}$\nand $g_{2}$. In this paper we show that, for velocity independent correlations,\nthe kinetic equation for $f_{1}$ reduces to the model proposed by Martys[Martys\nN S 1999 \\textit{IJMPC} \\textbf{10} 1367-1382]. In the steady state limit, the\nkinetic equation for $g_{2}$ reduces to Born-Green-Yvon (BGY) hierarchy for\nhomogeneous density. We also prove that the present scheme respects the energy\nconservation and under specific circumstances, time symmetry \\textit{i.e.,}\n$\\displaystyle \\frac{dH(t)}{dt} = 0$ where $H(t)$ refers to the Boltzmann's\nH-function.\n", "  We report a measurement of the inclusive $B\\to X_{s+d} \\gamma$ and $B\\to\nX_{s} \\gamma$ branching fractions using a data set of $(772 \\pm 11)\\times 10^6$\n$B\\bar{B}$ pairs collected at the $\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with the Belle\ndetector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$ collider. Results are presented\nfor photon energy thresholds between 1.7 to 2.0 GeV. For the 1.8 GeV threshold\nwe find $\\mathcal{B}_{s\\gamma} = (3.01 \\pm 0.10~\\text{(stat)} \\pm\n0.18~\\text{(syst)} \\pm 0.08~\\text{(model)})\\times 10^{-4}$. The Heavy Quark\nExpansion parameters that best fit the spectrum in the shape-function scheme\nare $m_{b} = (4.626 \\pm 0.028) \\text{GeV}$ and $ \\mu_{\\pi}^{2} = (0.301\\pm\n0.063) \\text{GeV}^2$.\n", "  The experimental data in the literature for the hcp phase of the Mg-Al-Zn\nternary system have been critically reviewed. Based on the concentration\nprofiles from the literature, the diffusion coefficients have been re-extracted\nusing the Hall method for the impurity diffusion, and the Sauer-Freise and the\nWhittle-Green strategies for interdiffusion coefficients in binary and ternary\nsystems, respectively. Moreover, extra interdiffusion coefficients were\nobtained from the Darken-type couples, which present relative maxima or/and\nminima at the concentration profiles. This information was assessed to obtain\nan atomic mobility database, by means of DICTRA software in conjunction with\nthe CALPHAD thermodynamic description that is able to reproduce the diffusion\ncouple experiments. Comprehensive comparisons between the calculated results\nand experimental values show an excellent agreement not only for the diffusion\ncoefficient data, but also for the concentration profiles and the diffusion\npaths.\n", "  We present a solution method for the inverse scattering problem for\nintegrable two-dimensional relativistic quantum field theories, specified in\nterms of a given massive single particle spectrum and a factorizing S-matrix.\nAn arbitrary number of massive particles transforming under an arbitrary\ncompact global gauge group is allowed, thereby generalizing previous\nconstructions of scalar theories. The two-particle S-matrix $S$ is assumed to\nbe an analytic solution of the Yang-Baxter equation with standard properties,\nincluding unitarity, TCP invariance, and crossing symmetry. Using methods from\noperator algebras and complex analysis, we identify sufficient criteria on $S$\nthat imply the solution of the inverse scattering problem. These conditions are\nshown to be satisfied in particular by so-called diagonal S-matrices, but\npresumably also in other cases such as the $O(N)$-invariant nonlinear\n$\\sigma$-models.\n", "  In this communication, we show that both infinite-dimensional versions of\nNoether's theorems, and the explanation of quantum anomalies can be obtained\nusing similar formulas for the derivatives of functions whose values are\nmeasures (Smolyanov and von Weizsaecker, 1995) or pseudomeasures (Gough, Ratiu\nand Smolyanov, 2015). In particular, we improve son these results.\n", "  We study Heisenberg antiferromagnets on a diamond-like decorated square\nlattice perturbed by further neighbor couplings. The second-order effective\nHamiltonian is calculated and the resultant Hamiltonian is found to be a\nsquare-lattice quantum-dimer model with a finite hopping amplitude and no\nrepulsion, which suggests the stabilization of the plaquette phase. Our recipe\nfor constructing quantum-dimer models can be adopted for other lattices and\nprovides a route for the experimental realization of quantum-dimer models.\n", "  Outstanding crystalline perfection is a key requirement for the formation of\nnew forms of electronic order in a vast number of widely different materials.\nWhereas excellent sample quality represents a standard claim in the literature,\nthere are, quite generally, no reliable microscopic probes to establish the\nnature and concentration of lattice defects such as voids, dislocations and\ndifferent species of point defects on the level relevant to the length and\nenergy scales inherent to these new forms of order. Here we report an\nexperimental study of the archetypical skyrmion-lattice compound MnSi, where we\nrelate the characteristic types of point defects and their concentration to the\nmagnetic properties by combining different types of positron spectroscopy with\nab-initio calculations and bulk measurements. We find that Mn antisite disorder\nbroadens the magnetic phase transitions and lowers their critical temperatures,\nwhereas the skyrmion lattice phase forms for all samples studied underlining\nthe robustness of this topologically non-trivial state. Taken together, this\ndemonstrates the unprecedented sensitivity of positron spectroscopy in studies\nof new forms of electronic order.\n", "  Electronic Raman scattering and optical phonon self-energies are studied on\nsingle crystals of $LuB_{12}$ with different isotopic composition in the\ntemperature region 10-650K and at pressures up to 10 GPa. The shape and energy\nposition of the spectral peaks depend on the magnitude of the probed wave\nvector, temperature, and symmetry of excitations. We simulated experimental\nspectra using electronic structure obtained in the density function theory and\ntaking into account the electron-phonon scattering. The emergence of a broad\ncontinuum in the spectra is identified with the inelastic scattering of light\nfrom the electronic intraband excitations. Their coupling to non-fully\nsymmetric phonon modes is the source of both the Fano interference and\ntemperature-dependent phonon self-energies. In addition, long wavelength\nvibrations of the boron atoms are in nonadiabatic regime, so the electronic\ncontribution to their self-energies provides a temperature dependence that is\nsimilar to the anharmonic contribution. Comparison of calculation and\nexperiment allowed us to determine the coupling constant $\\lambda_{ep}$=0.32,\nwhich gives correct critical temperature of the transition to the\nsuperconducting state.\n", "  These lectures are intended to provide the theoretical basis of describing\nhigh-energy particle collisions at a level appropriate to graduate students in\nexperimental high energy physics. They are supposed to be familiar with quantum\nelectrodynamics, the concept of Feynman rules, Feynman graphs and computation\nof the cross section in quantum field theory.\n", "  The Standard Model is one of the main intellectual achievements for about the\nlast 50 years, a result of many theoretical and experimental studies. In this\nlecture a brief introduction to the electroweak part of the Standard Model is\ngiven. Since the Standard Model is a quantum field theory, some aspects for\nunderstanding of quantization of abelian and non-abelian gauge theories are\nalso briefly discussed. It is demonstrated how well the electroweak Standard\nModel works in describing a large variety of precise experimental measure-\nments at lepton and hadron colliders.\n", "  A combined theoretical/numerical/experimental program is outlined for\nextending the ILG approach to consider time lags, stochasticity and\nmultiphysics couplings. Through this extension it is possible to discuss the\ninterplay between deformation internal lengths (ILs) and ILs induced by\nthermal, diffusion or electric field gradients. Size-dependent multiphysics\nstability diagrams are obtained, and size-dependent serrated stress-strain\ncurves are interpreted through combined gradient-stochastic models. When\ndifferential equations are not available for describing material behavior, a\nTsallis non-extensive thermodynamic formulation is employed to characterize\nstatistical properties. A novel multiscale coarse graining technique, the\nequation free method (EFM), is suggested for bridging length scales, and the\nsame is done for determining ILs through novel laboratory tests by employing\nspecimens with fabricated gradient micro/nano structures. Three emerging\nresearch areas are discussed: (i) Plastic instabilities and size effects in\nnanocrystalline (NC)/ultrafine grain (UFG) and bulk metallic glass (BMG)\nmaterials; (ii) Chemomechanical damage, electromechanical degradation, and\nphotomechanical aging in energetic materials; (iii) Brain tissue and neural\ncell modeling. Finally, a number of benchmark problems are considered in more\ndetail. They include gradient chemoelasticity for Li-ion battery electrodes;\ngradient piezoelectric and flexoelectric materials; elimination of\nsingularities from crack tips; derivation of size-dependent stability diagrams\nfor shear banding in BMGs; modeling of serrated size-dependent stress-strain\ncurves in micro/nanopillars; description of serrations and multifractal\npatterns through Tsallis q-statistics; and an extension of gradient\nelasticity/plasticity models to include fractional derivatives and fractal\nmedia.\n", "  We present a discussion of the consequences in perturbation theory when an\nexact eigenfunctions and eigenvalues to to the zeroth order Hamiltonian $H_0$\ncannot be found. Since the usual approximations such as projecting the\nwavefunction on to a finite basis set and restricting the particle interaction\nis a way of constructing an approximate zeroth order Hamiltonian $H_0'$ we will\nhere argue that the exact eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are always found for\n$H_0'$. We will show that as long as the perturbative expansion does not depend\non any intrinsic properties of $H_0$ but only on knowing the exact\neigenfunctions and eigenvalues then any perturbative statement, such as origin\nindependence intensities, will be true for any $H_0'$ provided that $H_0'$ has\na spectrum. We will use this to show that the origin independence for the\nintensities is trivially fulfilled in the velocity gauge but also can be\nfulfilled exactly in the length gauge if an appropriate $H_0$ is chosen.\nFinally a small numerically demonstration of the origin dependence of the terms\nfor the second-order intensities in both the length and velocity gauge is\nundertaking to numerically illustrate the theoretical statements.\n", "  The origin of the highest-energy particles in nature, the ultra-high-energy\n(UHE) cosmic rays, is still unknown. In order to resolve this mystery, very\nlarge detectors are required to probe the low flux of these particles - or to\ndetect the as-yet unobserved flux of UHE neutrinos predicted from their\ninteractions. The `lunar Askaryan technique' is a method to do both. When\nenergetic particles interact in a dense medium, the Askaryan effect produces\nintense coherent pulses of radiation in the MHz--GHz range. By using radio\ntelescopes to observe the Moon and look for nanosecond pulses, the entire\nvisible lunar surface ($20$ million km$^2$) can be used as an UHE particle\ndetector. A large effective area over a broad bandwidth is the primary\ntelescope requirement for lunar observations, which makes large single-aperture\ninstruments such as the Five-Hundred-Meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope\n(FAST) well-suited to the technique. In this contribution, we describe the\nlunar Askaryan technique and its unique observational requirements. Estimates\nof the sensitivity of FAST to both the UHE cosmic ray and neutrino flux are\ngiven, and we describe the methods by which lunar observations with FAST,\nparticularly if equipped with a broadband phased-array feed, could detect the\nflux of UHE cosmic rays.\n", "  The lunar Askaryan technique is a method to study the highest-energy cosmic\nrays, and their predicted counterparts, the ultra-high-energy neutrinos. By\nobserving the Moon with a radio telescope, and searching for the characteristic\nnanosecond-scale Askaryan pulses emitted when a high-energy particle interacts\nin the outer layers of the Moon, the visible lunar surface can be used as a\ndetection area. Several previous experiments, at Parkes, Goldstone, Kalyazin,\nWesterbork, the ATCA, Lovell, LOFAR, and the VLA, have developed the necessary\ntechniques to search for these pulses, but existing instruments have lacked the\nnecessary sensitivity to detect the known flux of cosmic rays from such a\ndistance. This will change with the advent of the SKA.\n  The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will be the world's most powerful radio\ntelescope. To be built in southern Africa, Australia and New Zealand during the\nnext decade, it will have an unsurpassed sensitivity over the key 100 MHz to\nfew-GHZ band. We introduce a planned experiment to use the SKA to observe the\nhighest-energy cosmic rays and, potentially, neutrinos. The estimated event\nrate will be presented, along with the predicted energy and directional\nresolution. Prospects for directional studies with phase 1 of the SKA will be\ndiscussed, as will the major technical challenges to be overcome to make full\nuse of this powerful instrument. Finally, we show how phase 2 of the SKA could\nprovide a vast increase in the number of detected cosmic rays at the highest\nenergies, and thus to provide new insight into their spectrum and origin.\n", "  Chirality is a fundamental property of electrons with the relativistic\nspectrum found in graphene and topological insulators. It plays a crucial role\nin relativistic phenomena, such as Klein tunneling, but it is difficult to\nvisualize directly. Here we report the direct observation and manipulation of\nchirality and pseudospin polarization in the tunneling of electrons between two\nalmost perfectly aligned graphene crystals. We use a strong in-plane magnetic\nfield as a tool to resolve the contributions of the chiral electronic states\nthat have a phase difference between the two components of their vector\nwavefunction. Our experiments not only shed light on chirality, but also\ndemonstrate a technique for preparing graphene's Dirac electrons in a\nparticular quantum chiral state in a selected valley.\n", "  We provide a method to construct entanglement criteria for arbitrary\nmultipartite systems of discrete or continuous variables and hybrid\ncombinations of both. While any set of local operators generates a sufficient\ncondition for entanglement of arbitrary quantum states, a suitable set leads to\na necessary and sufficient criterion for pure states. The criteria are readily\nimplementable with existing technology and reveal entanglement that remains\nundetected by the respective state-of-the-art methods for discrete and\ncontinuous variables.\n", "  Protection of accelerator equipment is as old as accelerator technology and\nwas for many years related to high-power equipment. Examples are the protection\nof powering equipment from overheating (magnets, power converters, high-current\ncables), of superconducting magnets from damage after a quench and of\nklystrons. The protection of equipment from beam accidents is more recent,\nalthough there was one paper that discussed beam-induced damage for the SLAC\nlinac (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) as early as in 1967. It is related\nto the increasing beam power of high-power proton accelerators, to the emission\nof synchrotron light by electron-positron accelerators and to the increase of\nenergy stored in the beam. Designing a machine protection system requires an\nexcellent understanding of accelerator physics and operation to anticipate\npossible failures that could lead to damage. Machine protection includes beam\nand equipment monitoring, a system to safely stop beam operation (e.g. dumping\nthe beam or stopping the beam at low energy) and an interlock system providing\nthe glue between these systems. The most recent accelerator, LHC, will operate\nwith about 3 x 10$^{14}$ protons per beam, corresponding to an energy stored in\neach beam of 360 MJ. This energy can cause massive damage to accelerator\nequipment in case of uncontrolled beam loss, and a single accident damaging\nvital parts of the accelerator could interrupt operation for years. This\nlecture will provide an overview of the requirements for protection of\naccelerator equipment and introduces various protection systems. Examples are\nmainly from LHC and ESS.\n", "  A basic introduction to transverse and longitudinal beam dynamics as well as\nthe most relevant beam loss mechanisms in circular machines will be presented\nin this lecture. This lecture is intended for physicists and engineers with\nlittle or no knowledge of this subject.\n", "  Beam loss is a critical issue in high-intensity accelerators, and much effort\nis expended during both the design and operation phases to minimize the loss\nand to keep it to manageable levels. As new accelerators become ever more\npowerful, beam loss becomes even more critical. Linacs for H- ion beams, such\nas the one at the Oak Ridge Spallation Neutron Source, have many more loss\nmechanisms compared to H+ (proton) linacs, such as the one being designed for\nthe European Spallation Neutron Source. Interesting H- beam loss mechanisms\ninclude residual gas stripping, H+ capture and acceleration, field stripping,\nblack-body radiation and the recently discovered intra-beam stripping\nmechanism. Beam halo formation, and ion source or RF turn on/off transients,\nare examples of beam loss mechanisms that are common for both H+ and H-\naccelerators. Machine protection systems play an important role in limiting the\nbeam loss.\n", "  Generalizing the concept of Gordon potentials to measures we prove a version\nof Gordon's theorem for measures as potentials and show absence of eigenvalues\nfor these one-dimensional Schr\\\"odinger operators.\n", "  By expressing the discrete Schrodinger equation as a second-order\nfinite-difference equation with constant coefficients, the renormalization\nequations for substituted benzene dimers are derived via the c_n-coefficient\nelimination procedure. On subjecting the benzene molecule to a linear applied\nfield, the resulting field-modified site energies are obtained, by projecting\nthe site-energy locations onto a corresponding benzene dimer axis.\nIncorporating these modified site energies into the Lippmann-Schwinger\nscattering theory, enables the field effect to manifest itself in the\nsubstituted benzene electron transmission spectral function T(E). Variations in\nthe T(E) energy spectra, arising from increases in the applied field gradient\nf, are described for each substituted benzene, and comparison made between\ntheir various patterns' behaviours. A common feature of the T(E) curves is\ntheir shifts to lower energies, as f increases to a calculated limiting value.\n", "  Various effects of intense synchrotron radiation on the performance of\nparticle accelerators, especially for storage rings, are discussed. Following a\nbrief introduction to synchrotron radiation, the basic concepts of heat load,\ngas load, electron emission, and the countermeasures against these effects are\ndiscussed.\n", "  In this article a definition of reversible processes in terms of differences\nin intensive Thermodynamics properties (Affinities) is proposed. This\ndefinition makes it possible to both define reversible processes before\nintroducing the concept of entropy and avoid the circularity problem that\nfollows from the Clausius definition of entropy changes. The convenience of\nthis new definition compared to those commonly found in textbooks is\ndemonstrated with examples.\n", "  Semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) experience stress and charge transfer by\nembedding materials or ligands and impurity atoms. In return, the environment\nof NCs experiences a NC stress response which may lead to matrix deformation\nand propagated strain. Up to now, there is no universal gauge to evaluate the\nstress impact on NCs and their response as a function of NC size\n$d_{\\mathrm{NC}}$. I deduce geometrical number series as analytical tools to\nobtain the number of NC atoms $N_{\\mathrm{NC}}(d_{\\mathrm{NC}}[i])$, bonds\nbetween NC atoms $N\\mathrm{_{bnd}}(d_{\\mathrm{NC}}[i])$ and interface bonds\n$N\\mathrm{_{IF}}(d_{\\mathrm{NC}}[i])$ for seven high symmetry zinc-blende (zb)\nNCs with low-index faceting: {001} cubes, {111} octahedra, {110} dodecahedra,\n{001}-{111} pyramids, {111} tetrahedra, {111}-{001} quatrodecahedra and\n{001}-{111} quadrodecahedra. The fundamental insights into NC structures\nrevealed here allow for major advancements in data interpretation and\nunderstanding of zb- and diamond-lattice based nanomaterials. The analytical\nnumber series can serve as a standard procedure for stress evaluation in solid\nstate spectroscopy due to their deterministic nature, easy use and general\napplicability over a wide range of spectroscopy methods as well as NC sizes,\nforms and materials.\n", "  We review recent developments in the spectral theory of continuum\none-dimensional quasicystals, yielding purely singular continuous spectrum for\nthese Schr\\\"odinger operators. Allowing measures as potentials we can\ngeneralize some results to very singular potentials, including Kronig-Penney\ntype models.\n", "  Th is paper is motivated by the growing importance of better understanding of\nthe phenomena and consequences of high- intensity energetic particle beam\ninteractions with accelerator, generic target , and detector components. It\nreviews the principal physical processes of fast-particle interactions with\nmatter, effects in materials under irradiation, materials response, related to\ncomponent lifetime and performance, simulation techniques, and methods of\nmitigating the impact of radiation on the components and envir onment in\nchallenging current and future application\n", "  A high quality amorphous silicon (a-Si) nanostructures has grown\nexperimentally to study the origin of light emission and the quantum\nconfinement effect in a-Si. The quantum confinement effect increases the band\ngap of material as the size of quantum structure decreases, which results in a\nblue shift in optical luminescence and energy absorption. Here we demonstrate\nthis effect using extended H\\\"uckel method to calculate fundamental band gap\nand optical absorption energy of a-Si samples with various dot sizes. As\nresult, when the dot size was decreased from 2.2 to 1.0 nm, the absorption\nspectra peak shifted toward higher energy from 2.278 eV to 3.856 eV.\n", "  Vegetation characteristics providing spatial heterogeneity at the channel\nreach scale can produce complex flow patterns and the relationship between\nplant patterns morphology and flow resistance is still an open question (Nepf\n2012). Unlike experiments in laboratory, measuring the vegetation\ncharacteristics related to flow resistance on open channel in situ is\ndifficult. Thanks to its high resolution and light weight, scanner lasers allow\nnow to collect in situ 3D vegetation characteristics. In this study we used a\n1064 nm usual Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) located 5 meters at nadir above a\n8 meters long equipped channel in order to both i) characterize the vegetation\nstructure heterogeneity within the channel form a single scan (blockage factor,\ncanopy height) and ii) to measure the 2D water level all over the channel\nduring steady flow within a few seconds scan. This latter measuring system was\npossible thanks to an additive dispersive product sprinkled at the water\nsurface. Vegetation characteristics and water surfaces during steady flows from\n6 different plant spatial design on channel bottom for 4 plant species were\nthus measured. Vegetation blockage factors at channel scale were estimated from\nTLS points clouds and analyzed.\n", "  Wireless transfer of power via high frequency microwave radiation using a\nminiature split ring resonator rectenna is reported. RF power is converted into\nDC power by integrating a rectification circuit with the split ring resonator.\nThe near-field behavior of the rectenna is investigated with microwave\nradiation in the frequency range between 20-40 GHz with a maximum power level\nof 17 dBm. The observed resonance peaks match those predicted by simulation.\nPolarization studies show the expected maximum in signal when the electric\nfield is polarized along the edge of the split ring resonator with the gap and\nminimum for perpendicular orientation. The efficiency of the rectenna is on the\norder of 1% for a frequency of 37.2 GHz. By using a cascading array of 9 split\nring resonators the output power was increased by a factor of 20.\n", "  Atmospheric electric field (AEF) measurements were carried out in three\ndifferent sites forming a triangular array in Southern Portugal. The campaign\nwas performed during the summer characterized by Saharan dust outbreaks; the\n16th-17th July 2014 desert dust event is considered here. Evidence of\nlong-range dust electrification is attributed to the air-Earth electrical\ncurrent creating a positive space-charge inside of the dust layer. An increase\nof ~23 V/m is observed in AEF on the day of the dust event corresponding to\nspace-charges of ~20-2 pCm-3 (charge layer thicknesses ~10-100 m). A reduction\nof AEF is observed after the dust event.\n", "  Ferric Chloride-Bismaleimide (FeCl3-BMI) and Titania-Bismaleimide (TiO2-BMI)\ncomposite were synthesized using PVA as a binder. The composite systems were\ndeposited on glass slide as a homogenous coating. XRD and FTIR studies of the\ncomposite system showed its crystalline and structural configuration. A mixed\nphase of TiO2 and BMI as well as short range crystallinity was observed. An\nincrease in crystallinity with temperature was also seen. The percentage of N-H\nsymmetric stretching was also found to increase with temperature.\n", "  Balloon-borne astronomy is unique in that it allows for a level of image\nstability, resolution, and optical backgrounds that are comparable to\nspace-borne systems due to greatly reduced atmospheric interference, but at a\nfraction of the cost and over a significantly reduced development time-scale.\nInstruments operating within visible-to-near-UV bands ($300$ - $900$ um) can\nachieve a theoretical diffraction limited resolution of $0.01\"$ from the\nstratosphere ($35$ - $40$ km altitude) without the need for extensive adaptive\noptical systems required by ground-based systems. The {\\it Superpressure\nBalloon-borne Imaging Telescope} (\"SuperBIT\") is a wide-field imager designed\nto achieve 0.02$\"$ stability over a 0.5$^\\circ$ field-of-view, for deep single\nexposures of up to 5 minutes. SuperBIT is thus well-suited for many\nastronomical observations, from solar or extrasolar planetary observations, to\nresolved stellar populations and distant galaxies (whether to study their\nmorphology, evolution, or gravitational lensing by foreground mass). We report\nSuperBIT's design and implementation, emphasizing its two-stage real-time\nstabilization: telescope stability to $1$ - $2\"$ at the telescope level (a goal\nsurpassed during a test flight in September 2015) and image stability down to\n$0.02\"$ via an actuated tip-tilt mirror in the optical path (to be tested\nduring a flight in 2016). The project is progressing toward a fully\noperational, three month flight from New Zealand by 2018\n", "  This is the final version of my master thesis. I prove that there are no\ntwist star products on the 2-sphere and on the higher genus pretzel surfaces\ndeforming a symplectic structure. One of the key arguments is that a connected\ncompact symplectic manifold endowed with a twist star product has to be a\nhomogeneous space. Furthermore, there is a non-degenerate r-matrix on a Lie\nalgebra whose Lie group is acting transitively and effectively on the manifold\nin this case. I recap the theory of homogeneous spaces, in particular the\nclassification of transitive effective actions on the 2-sphere, and discuss the\nnotion of r-matrices and Drinfel'd twists. Some results of this thesis are\navailable as a preprint with Pierre Bieliavsky, Chiara Esposito and Stefan\nWaldmann on arxiv.org under the title \"Obstructions for Twist Star Products\".\n", "  The Euler and Navier-Stokes equations both belong to a closed system of three\ntransport equations, describing the particle number density N, the macroscopic\nvelocity v and the temperature T. These sytems are complete, leaving no room\nfor any additional equation. Nonetheless, it is common practice in parts of the\nliterature to replace the thermal equation by the incompressibility condition\ndiv v = 0, motivated by the wish to obtain simpler equations. It is shown that\nthis procedure is physically inconsistent in several ways, with the consequence\nthat incompressibility is not a property that can be enforced by an external\ncondition. Incompressible behaviour, if existing, will have to follow\nself-consistently from the full set of transport equations.\n", "  Density gradient theory (DGT) allows fast and accurate determination of\nsurface tension and density profile through a phase interface. Several\nalgorithms have been developed to apply this theory in practical calculations.\nWhile the conventional algorithm requires a reference substance of the system,\na modified \"stabilized density gradient theory\" (SDGT) algorithm is introduced\nin our work to solve DGT equations for multiphase pure and mixed systems. This\nalgorithm makes it possible to calculate interfacial properties accurately at\nany domain size larger than the interface thickness without choosing a\nreference substance or assuming the functional form of the density profile. As\npart of DGT inputs, the perturbed chain statistical associating fluid theory\n(PC-SAFT) equation of state (EoS) was employed for the first time with the SDGT\nalgorithm. PC-SAFT has excellent performance in predicting liquid phase\nproperties as well as phase behaviors. The SDGT algorithm with the PC-SAFT EoS\nwas tested and compared with experimental data for several systems. Numerical\nstability analyses were also included in each calculation to verify the\nreliability of this approach for future applications.\n", "  The population of known extrasolar planets includes giant and terrestrial\nplanets that closely orbit their host star. Such planets experience significant\ntidal distortions that can force the planet into synchronous rotation. The\ncombined effects of tidal deformation and centripetal acceleration induces\nsignificant asphericity in the shape of these planets, compared to the mild\noblateness of Earth, with maximum gravitational acceleration at the poles. Here\nwe show that this latitudinal variation in gravitational acceleration is\nrelevant for modeling the climate of oblate planets including Jovian planets\nwithin the solar system, closely-orbiting hot Jupiters, and planets within the\nhabitable zone of white dwarfs. We compare first- and third-order\napproximations for gravitational acceleration on an oblate spheroid and\ncalculate the geostrophic wind that would result from this asphericity on a\nrange of solar system planets and exoplanets. Third-order variations in\ngravitational acceleration are negligible for Earth but become significant for\nJupiter, Saturn, and Jovian exoplanets. This latitudinal variation in\ngravitational acceleration can be measured remotely, and the formalism\npresented here can be implemented for use in general circulation climate\nmodeling studies of exoplanet atmospheres.\n", "  The thermal conductivity of low-dimensional materials and graphene\nnanoribbons in particular, is limited by the strength of line-edge-roughness\nscattering. One way to characterize the roughness strength is the dependency of\nthe thermal conductivity on the channel width in the form W^{\\beta}. Although\nin the case of electronic transport this dependency is very well studied,\nresulting in W^6 for nanowires and quantum wells and W^4 for nanoribbons, in\nthe case of phonon transport it is not yet clear what this dependence is. In\nthis work, using lattice dynamics and Non-Equilibrium Greens Function\nsimulations, we examine the width dependence of the thermal conductivity of\nultra-narrow graphene nanoribbons under the influence of line edge-roughness.\nWe show that the exponent {\\beta} is in fact not a single well-defined number,\nbut it is different for different parts of the phonon spectrum depending on\nwhether phonon transport is ballistic, diffusive, or localized. The exponent\n{\\beta} takes values {\\beta} < 1 for semi-ballistic phonon transport, values\n{\\beta} >> than 1 for sub-diffusive or localized phonons, and {\\beta} = 1 only\nin the case where the transport is diffusive. The overall W^{\\beta} dependence\nof the thermal conductivity is determined by the width-dependence of the\ndominant phonon modes (usually the acoustic ones). We show that due to the long\nphonon mean-free-paths, the width-dependence of thermal conductivity becomes a\nchannel length dependent property, because the channel length determines\nwhether transport is ballistic, diffusive, or localized.\n", "  In tight binding approximation the explicit form of the electron energy in\ngraphene superlattice was derived. The possibility of propagation of the\ncnoidal waves in graphene superlattice was discussed. The direct current\ninduced perpendicularly to the superlattice axis by cnoidal and sinusoidal\nelectromagnetic waves under the presence of longitudinal constant electric\nfield was calculated. Such direct current was shown to change its direction\nwhen the intensity of longitudinal electric field changes its absolute value.\n", "  The FLUKA Monte Carlo code, presently used in cosmic ray physics, contains\npackages to sample soft hadronic processes which are built according to the\nDual Parton Model. This is a phenomenological model capable of reproducing many\nof the features of hadronic collisions in the non perturbative QCD regime. The\nbasic principles of the model are summarized and, as an example, the associated\nLambda-K production is discussed. This is a process which has some relevance\nfor the calculation of atmospheric neutrino fluxes.\n", "  We show how the gauge-invariance formulation given by Haberzettl is\nimplemented in practice for photoproduction amplitudes at the tree level with\nform factors describing composite nucleons. We demonstrate that, in contrast to\nOhta's gauge-invariance prescription, this formalism allows electric current\ncontributions to be multiplied by a form factor, i.e., it does not require that\nthey be treated like bare currents. While different in detail, this\nnevertheless lends support to previous ad hoc approaches which multiply the\nBorn amplitudes by an overall form factor. Numerical results for kaon\nphotoproduction off the nucleon are given. They show that the gauge procedure\nby Haberzettl leads to much improved $\\chi^2$ values as compared to Ohta's\nprescription.\n"]}
