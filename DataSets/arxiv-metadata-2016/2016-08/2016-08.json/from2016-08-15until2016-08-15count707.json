"abstract": ["  Quantum metrology research promises approaches to build new sensors that\nachieve the ultimate level of precision measurement and perform fundamentally\nbetter than modern sensors. Practical schemes that tolerate realistic\nfabrication imperfections and environmental noise are required in order to\nrealise quantum-enhanced sensors and to enable their real-world application. We\nhave demonstrated the key enabling principles of a practical, loss-tolerant\napproach to photonic quantum metrology designed to harness all multi-photon\ncomponents in spontaneous parametric downconversion---a method for generating\nmultiple photons that we show requires no further fundamental state engineering\nfor use in practical quantum metrology. We observe a quantum advantage of 28%\nin precision measurement of optical phase using the four-photon detection\ncomponent of this scheme, despite 83% system loss. This opens the way to new\nquantum sensors based on current quantum-optical capabilities.\n", "  The Ginzburg-Landau equations play a key role in superconductivity and\nparticle physics. They inspired many imitations in other areas of physics.\nThese equations have two remarkable classes of solutions -- vortices and\n(Abrikosov) vortex lattices. For the standard cylindrical geometry, the\nexistence theory for these solutions, as well as the stability theory of\nvortices are well developed. The latter is done within the context of the\ntime-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations -- the Gorkov-Eliashberg-Schmid\nequations of superconductivity -- and the abelian Higgs model of particle\nphysics.\n  We study stability of Abrikosov vortex lattices under finite energy\nperturbations satisfying a natural parity condition (both defined precisely in\nthe text) for the dynamics given by the Gorkov-Eliashberg-Schmid equations. For\nmagnetic fields close to the second critical magnetic field and for arbitrary\nlattice shapes, we prove that there exist two functions on the space of\nlattices, such that Abrikosov vortex lattice solutions are asymptotically\nstable, provided the superconductor is of Type II and these functions are\npositive, and unstable, for superconductors of Type I, or if one of these\nfunctions is negative.\n", "  We report the low temperature magnetic properties of Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$, a\nrare-earth pyrochlore. Our susceptibility and magnetization measurements show\nthat due to the thermal isolation of a Kramers doublet ground state,\nCe$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ has Ising-like magnetic moments of $\\sim1.18$\n$\\mu_\\mathrm{B}$. The magnetic moments are confined to the local trigonal axes,\nas in a spin ice, but the exchange interactions are antiferromagnetic. Below 1\nK the system enters a regime with antiferromagnetic correlations. In contrast\nto predictions for classical $\\langle 111 \\rangle$-Ising spins on the\npyrochlore lattice, there is no sign of long-range ordering down to 0.02 K. Our\nresults suggest that Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ features an antiferromagnetic liquid\nground state with strong quantum fluctuations.\n", "  Given a gapped Hamiltonian of a spin chain, we give a polynomial-time\nalgorithm for finding the degenerate ground space projector. The output is an\northonormal set of matrix product states that approximate the true ground space\nprojector up to an inverse polynomial error in any Schatten norm, with a\nruntime exponential in the degeneracy. Our algorithm is an extension of the\nrecent algorithm of Landau, Vazirani, and Vidick for the nondegenerate case,\nand it includes the recent improvements due to Huang. The main new idea is to\nincorporate the local distinguishability of ground states on the half-chain to\nensure that the algorithm returns a complete set of global ground states.\n", "  Known since Kepler's observation that a comet's tail is oriented away from\nthe sun, radiation pressure stimulated remarkable discoveries in\nelectromagnetism, quantum physics and relativity [1,2]. This phenomenon plays a\ncrucial role in a variety of systems, from atomic [3-5] to astronomical [6]\nscales. The pressure of light is associated with the momentum of photons, and\nit is usually assumed that both the optical momentum and the radiation-pressure\nforce are naturally aligned with the propagation of light, i.e., its\nwavevector. Here we report the direct observation of an extraordinary optical\nmomentum and force directed perpendicular to the wavevector, and proportional\nto the optical spin (i.e., degree of circular polarization). Such optical force\nwas recently predicted for evanescent waves [7] and other structured fields\n[8]. It can be associated with the enigmatic \"spin-momentum\" part of the\nPoynting vector, which was introduced by Belinfante in field theory 75 years\nago [9-11]. We measure this unusual transverse momentum using a nano-cantilever\ncapable of femto-Newton resolution, which is immersed in an evanescent optical\nfield above the total-internal-reflecting glass surface. Furthermore, the\ntransverse force we measure exhibits another polarization-dependent\ncontribution determined by the imaginary part of the complex Poynting vector.\nBy revealing new types of optical forces in structured fields, our experimental\nfindings revisit fundamental momentum properties of light and bring a new twist\nto optomechanics.\n", "  Entropy is a key measure in studies related to information theory and its\nmany applications. Campbell of the first time recognized that exponential of\nShannons entropy is just the size of the sample space when the distribution is\nuniform. In this paper, we introduce a quantity which is called exponential\nTsallis Havrda Charvat entropy and discuss its some properties. Further, we\ngave the application of exponential Tsallis Havrda Charvat entropy in quantum\ninformation theory which is called exponential quantum Tsallis Havrda Charvat\nentropy with its some major properties such as non-negative, concavity and\ncontinuity. It is found that projective measurement will not decrease the\nquantum entropy of a quantum state and at the end of the paper gave an upper\nbound on the quantum exponential entropy in terms of ensembles of pure state.\n", "  We study optimization programs given by a bilinear form over non-commutative\nvariables subject to linear inequalities. Problems of this form include the\nentangled value of two-prover games, entanglement-assisted coding for classical\nchannels and quantum-proof randomness extractors. We introduce an\nasymptotically converging hierarchy of efficiently computable semidefinite\nprogramming (SDP) relaxations for this quantum optimization. This allows us to\ngive upper bounds on the quantum advantage for all of these problems. Compared\nto previous work of Pironio, Navascues and Acin, our hierarchy has additional\nconstraints. By means of examples, we illustrate the importance of these new\nconstraints both in practice and for analytical properties. Moreover, this\nallows us to give a hierarchy of SDP outer approximations for the completely\npositive semidefinite cone introduced by Laurent and Piovesan.\n", "  We study the possibility of shielding a regular extremal black hole by means\nof a matter thin-shell. While the surface energy density $\\sigma$ on the static\nshell is negative, the tangential pressures $p$ are positive, both of them\nbeing finite when the shell approaches the black hole horizon. The\nDarmois-Israel junction conditions are used to find $\\sigma$ and $p$ in terms\nof the radius $a$ of the shell. The surface gravitational energy $E_{S}$ is\ncomputed, keeping track of the pressure contribution. The stability conditions\nare briefly investigated.\n", "  We show that an inflationary slow-roll potential can be derived as an IR\nlimit of the non-perturbative exact renormalisation group equation for a scalar\nfield within the mean-field approximation. The result follows without having to\nspecify a Lagrangian for the UV theory at the Planck scale. We assume that the\ntheory contains a scalar mode with suppressed coupling to other UV fields, and\nthat higher derivative couplings are suppressed. The resulting effective\npotential gives rise to slow-roll inflation, which is fully consistent with the\nrecent observations. As an example of how the proposed renormalisation group\nprocedure works, we perform an explicit calculation in the $\\phi^4$ theory.\n", "  Let $r(\\varphi)$ denote the orbit of Mercury. We compare the formulae\nobtained via general relativity for $r(\\varphi)$ and for the corresponding\nperihelion precession angle $\\Delta \\varphi$, with the formulae obtained via\nthe relativistic gravitational law, $F=GMm\\gamma^6/r^2$. The latter law can be\nderived from Newton's gravitational law by employing the gravitational rather\nthan the rest masses of the Sun and Mercury. Remarkably, it is found that the\ntwo expressions for the dominant part of $r(\\varphi)$ are identical and that\nthe two expressions for $\\Delta\\varphi$ are also identical.\n", "  Many topological phenomena first proposed and observed in the context of\nelectrons in solids have recently found counterparts in photonic and acoustic\nsystems. In this work, we demonstrate that non-Abelian Berry phases can arise\nwhen coherent states of light are injected into \"topological guided modes\" in\nspecially-fabricated photonic waveguide arrays. These modes are photonic\nanalogues of topological zero modes in electronic systems. Light traveling\ninside spatially well-separated topological guided modes can be braided,\nleading to the accumulation of non-Abelian phases, which depend on the order in\nwhich the guided beams are wound around one another. Notably, these effects\nsurvive the limit of large photon occupation, and can thus also be understood\nas wave phenomena arising directly from Maxwell's equations, without resorting\nto the quantization of light. We propose an optical interference experiment as\na direct probe of this non-Abelian braiding of light.\n", "  Relaxation of electrons in a Hubbard model coupled to a dissipative bosonic\nbath is studied to simulate the pump-probe photoemission measurement. From this\ninsight, we propose an experimental method of eliciting unoccupied part of the\nsingle-particle spectra at the equilibrium of doped-Mott insulators. We reveal\nfirst that effective temperatures of distribution functions and electronic\nspectra are different during the relaxation, which makes the frequently\nemployed thermalization picture inappropriate. Contrary to the conventional\nanalysis, we show that the unoccupied spectra at equilibrium can be detected as\nthe states that relax faster.\n", "  An analogy is pointed out between a polymer chain fluctuating in a\ntwo-dimensional nematic background and a freely floating material line buffeted\nby a two-dimensional turbulent fluid in the inertial (Kraichnan) regime. Under\ncertain conditions, the back-reaction of the line on the turbulent flow may be\nneglected. The fractal exponent related to the size-contour relation of the\nmaterial line is connected to a \"nematic\" correlation function in the bulk.\n", "  The gravitational collapse of massive stars serves to manifest the most\nsevere deviations of general relativity with respect to Newtonian gravity: the\nformation of horizons and spacetime singularities. Both features have proven to\nbe catalysts of deep physical developments, especially when combined with the\nprinciples of quantum mechanics. Nonetheless, it is seldom remarked that it is\nhardly possible to combine all these developments into a unified theoretical\nmodel, while maintaining reasonable prospects for the independent experimental\ncorroboration of its different parts. In this paper we review the current\ntheoretical understanding of the physics of gravitational collapse in order to\nhighlight this tension, stating the position that the standard view on\nevaporating black holes stands for. This serves as the motivation for the\ndiscussion of a recent proposal that offers the opposite perspective,\nrepresented by a set of geometries that regularize the classical singular\nbehavior and present modifications of the near-horizon Schwarzschild geometry\nas the result of the propagation of non-perturbative ultraviolet effects\noriginated in regions of high curvature. We present an extensive exploration of\nthe necessary steps on the explicit construction of these geometries, and\ndiscuss how this proposal could change our present understanding of\nastrophysical black holes and even offer the possibility of detecting genuine\nultraviolet effects on future gravitational wave experiments.\n", "  We study the $L\\to l l' l' \\nu_l \\nu_L$ decays ($L=\\tau,\\mu$; $l,l'=\\mu,e$)\nin the Standard Model (SM) and in the effective field theory (EFT) description\nof the weak charged current at low energy, both for polarized and unpolarized\n$L$, keeping the $l,l'$ mass dependence. We clarify the discrepancy between two\nprevious SM calculations of the decay rate improving their precision. The\nrecent $3.5\\,\\sigma$ anomaly found in $\\tau\\to e \\gamma\\bar{\\nu}_e\\nu_\\tau$\ncould be checked using our precise prediction for the $\\tau\\to e e e\n\\bar{\\nu}_e\\nu_\\tau$ decays, which shall be measured analyzing already existing\ndata from the first generation B-factories. It is shown how measurements of the\ndi-$l'$ mass distribution (with appropriate cuts) and $T$-asymmetries are able\nto reveal the corresponding lepton flavor violating (LFV) processes without\nneutrinos in the final state.\n", "  We compare X-ray and caustic mass profiles for a sample of 16 massive galaxy\nclusters. We assume hydrostatic equilibrium in interpreting the X-ray data, and\nuse large samples of cluster members with redshifts as a basis for applying the\ncaustic technique. The hydrostatic and caustic masses agree to better than\n$\\approx20\\%$ on average across the radial range covered by both techniques\n$(\\sim[0.2-1.25]R_{500})$. The mass profiles were measured independently and do\nnot assume a common functional form. Previous studies suggest that, at\n$R_{500}$, the hydrostatic and caustic masses are biased low and high\nrespectively. We find that the ratio of hydrostatic to caustic mass at\n$R_{500}$ is $1.20^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$; thus it is larger than 0.9 at\n$\\approx3\\sigma$ and the combination of under- and over-estimation of the mass\nby these two techniques is $\\approx10\\%$ at most. There is no indication of any\ndependence of the mass ratio on the X-ray morphology of the clusters,\nindicating that the hydrostatic masses are not strongly systematically affected\nby the dynamical state of the clusters. Overall, our results favour a small\nvalue of the so-called hydrostatic bias due to non-thermal pressure sources.\n", "  A significant step in space exploration during the 21st century will be human\nsettlement on Mars. Instead of transporting all the construction materials from\nEarth to the red planet with incredibly high cost, using Martian soil to\nconstruct a site on Mars is a superior choice. Knowing that Mars has long been\nconsidered a \"sulfur-rich planet\", a new construction material composed of\nsimulated Martian soil and molten sulfur is developed. In addition to the raw\nmaterial availability for producing sulfur concrete and a strength reaching\nsimilar or higher levels of conventional cementitious concrete, fast curing,\nlow temperature sustainability, acid and salt environment resistance, 100%\nrecyclability are appealing superior characteristics of the developed Martian\nConcrete. In this study, different percentages of sulfur are investigated to\nobtain the optimal mixing proportions. Three point bending, unconfined\ncompression and splitting tests were conducted to determine strength\ndevelopment, strength variability, and failure mechanisms. The test results\nshow that the strength of Martian Concrete doubles that of sulfur concrete\nutilizing regular sand. It is also shown that the particle size distribution\nplays an important role in the mixture's final strength. Furthermore, since\nMartian soil is metal rich, sulfates and, potentially, polysulfates are also\nformed during high temperature mixing, which might contribute to the high\nstrength. The optimal mix developed as Martian Concrete has an unconfined\ncompressive strength of above 50 MPa. The formulated Martian Concrete is\nsimulated by the Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM), which exhibits\nexcellent ability in modeling the material response under various loading\nconditions.\n", "  We consider a two-component, two-dimensional nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger system\nwith unequal dispersion coefficients and self-defocusing nonlinearities,\nchiefly with equal strengths of the self- and cross-interactions. In this\nsetting, a natural waveform with a nonvanishing background in one component is\na vortex, which induces an effective potential well in the second component,\nvia the nonlinear coupling of the two components. We show that the potential\nwell may support not only the fundamental bound state, but also multi-ring\nexcited radial state complexes for suitable ranges of values of the dispersion\ncoefficient of the second component. We systematically explore the existence,\nstability, and nonlinear dynamics of these states. The complexes involving the\nexcited radial states are weakly unstable, with a growth rate depending on the\ndispersion of the second component. Their evolution leads to transformation of\nthe multi-ring complexes into stable VB solitons ones with the fundamental\nstate in the second component. The excited states may be stabilized by a\nharmonic-oscillator trapping potential, as well as by unequal strengths of the\nself- and cross-repulsive nonlinearities.\n", "  We investigate the parameter space of a model which extends next to minimal\nsupersymmetric standard model (NMSSM) with the vectorlike (VL) particles. We\nfind that the $10+\\overline{10}$ model can explain the possible diphoton excess\nrecently revealed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, although the predicted\nsignal strength is a little smaller than the observed one.\n", "  A radioactive beam of 20Na is stopped in a gas cell filled with Ne gas. The\nstopped particles are polarized by optical pumping. The degree of polarization\nthat can be achieved is studied. A maximum polarization of 50% was found. The\ndynamic processes in the cell are described with a phenomenological model.\n", "  We report the low temperature magnetic properties of the pyrochlore\nPr$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. Polycrystalline and single-crystal samples are investigated\nusing time-of-flight neutron spectroscopy and macroscopic measurements,\nrespectively. The crystal-field splitting produces a non-Kramers doublet ground\nstate for Pr$^{3+}$, with Ising-like anisotropy. Below 0.5 K ferromagnetic\ncorrelations develop, which suggests that the system enters a spin ice-like\nstate associated with the metamagnetic behavior observed at\n$\\mu_0H_c\\sim2.4$~T. In this regime, the development of a discrete inelastic\nexcitation in the neutron spectra indicates the appearance of spin dynamics\nwhich are likely related to cooperative quantum fluctuations.\n", "  A remarkable yet mysterious property of black holes is that their entropy is\nproportional to the horizon area. This area law inspired the holographic\nprinciple, which was later realized concretely in gauge/gravity duality. In\nthis context, entanglement entropy is given by the area of a minimal surface in\na dual spacetime. However, discussions of area laws have been constrained to\nentanglement entropy, whereas a full understanding of a quantum state requires\nRenyi entropies. Here we show that all Renyi entropies satisfy a similar area\nlaw in holographic theories and are given by the areas of dual cosmic branes.\nThis geometric prescription is a one-parameter generalization of the minimal\nsurface prescription for entanglement entropy. Applying this we provide the\nfirst holographic calculation of mutual Renyi information between two disks of\narbitrary dimension. Our results provide a framework for efficiently studying\nRenyi entropies and understanding entanglement structures in strongly coupled\nsystems and quantum gravity.\n", "  The fractal structure of real world objects is often analyzed using digital\nimages. In this context, the compression fractal dimension is put forward. It\nprovides a simple method for the direct estimation of the dimension of fractals\nstored as digital image files. The computational scheme can be implemented\nusing readily available free software. Its simplicity also makes it very\ninteresting for introductory elaborations of basic concepts of fractal\ngeometry, complexity, and information theory. A test of the computational\nscheme using limited-quality images of well-defined fractal sets obtained from\nthe Internet and free software has been performed. Also, a systematic\nevaluation of the proposed method using computer generated images of the\nWeierstrass cosine function shows an accuracy comparable to those of the\nmethods most commonly used to estimate the dimension of fractal data sequences\napplied to the same test problem.\n", "  We analyze the Large Hadron Collider sensitivity to new pseudoscalar\nresonances decaying into diphoton with masses up to scales of few TeVs. We\nfocus on minimal scenarios where the production mechanisms involve either\nphoton or top-mediated gluon fusion, partially motivated by the tantalizing\nexcess around 750 GeV reported by ATLAS and CMS. The two scenarios lead\nrespectively to a narrow and a wide resonance. We first provide a\nmodel-independent analysis via effective operators and then introduce minimal\nmodels of composite dynamics where the diphoton channel is characterized by\ntheir topological sector. The relevant state here is the pseudoscalar\nassociated with the axial anomaly of the new composite dynamics. If the\nStandard Model top mass is generated via four-fermion operators the coupling of\nthis state to the top remarkably explains the wide-width resonance reported by\nATLAS. Beyond the excess, our analysis paves the way to test dynamical\nelectroweak symmetry breaking via topological sectors.\n", "  We introduce the third independent exactly solvable hypergeometric potential,\nafter the Eckart and the P\\\"oschl-Teller potentials, which is proportional to\nan energy-independent parameter and has a shape that is independent of this\nparameter. The general solution of the Schr\\\"odinger equation for this\npotential is written through fundamental solutions each of which presents an\nirreducible combination of two Gauss hypergeometric functions. The potential is\nan asymmetric step-barrier with variable height and steepness. Discussing the\ntransmission above such a barrier, we derive a compact formula for the\nreflection coefficient.\n", "  Using the complex $\\phi^4$-model as a prototype for a system which is\nsimulated by a worm algorithm, we show that not only the charged correlator\n$<\\phi^{*}(x)\\phi(y)>$, but also more general correlators such as\n$<|\\phi(x)||\\phi(y)|>$ or $<\\text{arg}(\\phi(x))\\text{arg}(\\phi(y))>$, as well\nas condensates like $<|\\phi|>$, can be measured at every step of the Monte\nCarlo evolution of the worm instead of on closed-worm configurations only. The\nmethod generalizes straightforwardly to other systems simulated by worms, such\nas spin or sigma models.\n", "  Convenient and simple numerical techniques for performing quantum\ncomputations based on matrix representations of Hilbert space operators are\npresented and illustrated by various examples. The applications include the\ncalculations of spectral and dynamical properties for one-dimensional and\ntwo-dimensional single-particle systems as well as bosonic many-particle and\nopen quantum systems. Due to their technical simplicity these methods are well\nsuited as a tool for teaching quantum mechanics to undergraduates and\ngraduates. Explicit implementations of the presented numerical methods in\nMatlab are given.\n", "  The investigation of any violation in the Cosmic Distance Duality Relation\n(CDDR) is one of the most important sources of investigation for a new physic.\nIn this paper we propose a new method to find the origin of a possible\nviolation on the CDDR. Such violation is defined from the equation\n$\\frac{d_L}{d_A(1+z)^2} = \\eta$, with $\\eta \\neq 1$. We analyze the\nobservational constraints from SNIa, BAO and $f_{gas}$ for the parameter $\\eta$\nusing three different parameterizations. We create three data sets with the\nfollowing combinations: (Set I) $d_L$ data from SNIa and $d_A$ data from BAO\nmeasurements, (Set II) $d_L$ data from $f_{gas}$ and $d_A$ from BAO\nmeasurements and (Set III) $d_L$ from SNIa and $d_A$ from $f_{gas}$\nmeasurements. The sets have 18 points and a redshift difference between the\nobservational pairs of $\\Delta z \\leq 0.08$. It is found that the difference\nbetween Sets I and II is up to five times higher than Sets I and III, what\nsuggest that a violation in the CDDR come from a new physics related with the\nangular diameter distance.\n", "  The dynamics of coupled condensates is a wide-encompassing problem with\nrelevance to superconductors, BECs in traps, superfluids, etc. Here, we provide\na unified picture of this fundamental problem that includes i) detuning of the\nfree energies, ii) different self-interaction strengths and iii) finite\nlifetime of the modes. At such, this is particularly relevant for the dynamics\nof polaritons, both for their internal dynamics between their light and matter\nconstituents, as well as for the more conventional dynamics of two spatially\nseparated condensates. Polaritons are short-lived, interact only through their\nmaterial fraction and are easily detuned. At such, they bring several\nvariations to their atomic counterpart. We show that the combination of these\nparameters results in important twists to the phenomenology of the Josephson\neffect, such as the behaviour of the relative phase (running or oscillating) or\nthe occurrence of self-trapping. We undertake a comprehensive stability\nanalysis of the fixed points on a normalized Bloch sphere, that allows us to\nprovide a generalized criterion to identify the Rabi and Josephson regimes in\npresence of detuning and decay.\n", "  The study of transverse optical pattern formation has been studied\nextensively in nonlinear optics, with a recent experimental interest in\nstudying the phenomenon using cold atoms, which can undergo real-space\nself-organization. Here, we describe our experimental observation of pattern\nformation in cold atoms, which occurs using less than 1 microWatt of applied\npower. We show that the optical patterns and the self-organized atomic\nstructures undergo continuous symmetry-breaking, which is characteristic of\nnon-equilibrium phenomena in a multimode system. To theoretically describe\npattern formation in cold atoms, we present a self-consistent model that allows\nfor tight atomic bunching in the applied optical lattice. We derive the\nnonlinear refractive index of a gas of multi-level atoms in an optical lattice,\nand we derive the threshold conditions under which pattern formation occurs. We\nshow that, by using small detunings and sub-Doppler temperatures, one achieves\ntwo orders of magnitude reduced intensity thresholds for pattern formation\ncompared to warm atoms.\n", "  We develop a new method for computing the holographic retarded propagator in\ngeneric (non-)equilibrium states using the state/geometry map. We check that\nour method reproduces the thermal spectral function given by the Son-Starinets\nprescription. The time-dependence of the spectral function of a relevant scalar\noperator is studied in a class of non-equilibrium states. The latter are\nrepresented by AdS-Vaidya geometries with an arbitrary parameter characterising\nthe timescale for the dual state to transit from an initial thermal equilibrium\nto another due to a homogeneous quench. For long quench duration, the spectral\nfunction indeed follows the thermal form at the instantaneous effective\ntemperature adiabatically, although with a slight initial time delay and a bit\npremature thermalisation. At shorter quench durations, several new\nnon-adiabatic features appear: (i) time-dependence of the spectral function is\nseen much before than that in the effective temperature (advanced\ntime-dependence), (ii) a big transfer of spectral weight to frequencies greater\nthan the initial temperature occurs at an intermediate time (kink formation)\nand (iii) new peaks with decreasing amplitudes but in greater numbers appear\neven after the effective temperature has stabilised (persistent oscillations).\nWe find four broad routes to thermalisation for lower values of spatial\nmomenta. At higher values of spatial momenta, kink formations and persistent\noscillations are suppressed, and thermalisation time decreases. The general\nthermalisation pattern is globally top-down, but a closer look reveals\ncomplexities.\n", "  Atomically thin black phosphorus (BP) is a promising two-dimensional material\nfor fabricating electronic and optoelectronic nano-devices with high mobility\nand tunable bandgap structures. However, the charge-carrier mobility in\nfew-layer phosphorene (monolayer BP) is mainly limited by the presence of\nimpurity and disorders. In this study, we demonstrate that vertical BP\nheterostructure devices offer great advantages in probing the electron states\nof monolayer and few-layer phosphorene at temperatures down to 2 K through\ncapacitance spectroscopy. Electronic states in the conduction and valence bands\nof phosphorene are accessible over a wide range of temperature and frequency.\nExponential band tails have been determined to be related to disorders. Unusual\nphenomena such as the large temperature-dependence of the electron state\npopulation in few-layer phosphorene have been observed and systematically\nstudied. By combining the first-principles calculation, we identified that the\nthermal excitation of charge trap states and oxidation-induced defect states\nwere the main reasons for this large temperature dependence of the electron\nstate population and degradation of the on-off ratio in phosphorene\nfield-effect transistors.\n", "  Two-dimensional Cr2N MXene as well as the surface-passivated Cr2NF2,\nCr2N(OH)2 and Cr2NO2 are investigated by using density functional theory. The\nCr2N is an anti-ferromagnetic metal. The F atom or OH group-passivation does\nnot change the anti-ferromagnetic characteristics. However, Cr2NO2 has a\nferromagnetic ground state, which is a half-metal. The half-metallicity of\nCr2NO2 is still robust when bias is applied to the nanometer sized device. The\nhalf-metallicity is intrinsic and does not require atomically clean surfaces.\nTherefore the stable surface-oxygen-passivated MXene is a good candidate for\nspintronics.\n", "  Motivated by the recent discovery of quantized spin Hall effect in InAs/GaSb\nquantum wells\\cite{du2013}$^,$\\cite{xu2014}, we theoretically study the effects\nof in-plane magnetic field and strain effect to the quantization of charge\nconductance by using Landauer-Butikker formalism. Our theory predicts a\nrobustness of the conductance quantization against the magnetic field up to a\nvery high field of 20 tesla. We use a disordered hopping term to model the\nstrain and show that the strain may help the quantization of the conductance.\nRelevance to the experiments will be discussed.\n", "  In recent years, it is evidenced that the individuals newly infected HIV are\ntransmitting the virus prior to knowing their HIV status. Identifying\nindividuals that are early in infection with HIV antibody negative (window\nperiod) remains problematic. In the newly infected individuals, HIV antigen p24\nis usually present in their serum or plasma 7-10 days before the HIV antibody.\nAfter antibody production initiates, the p24 antigen is bound into immune\ncomplexes. That means the detectable p24 antigens in serum/plasma are\nshort-lived, and their amount is in the pg/ml range. Thus, a rapid quantitative\nbio-detection system with high-sensitivity is required to achieve early disease\ndiagnosis. Magnetoresistive (MR) biosensor with ultra-high sensitivity\npossesses great potential in this area. In this study, a p24 detection assay\nusing MgO-based magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) sensor and 20-nm magnetic\nnanoparticles is reported.\n", "  Establishment of home-made measurement setups for the characterization of MR\nsensor is proposed and described here. The MR loops of MR sensors can be\nobtained with the instrument using two-point probe measurement and four-point\nprobe measurement. Two pairs of Helmholtz coils can supply a hard-axis magnetic\nfield and a soft-axis magnetic field for the sensor. The single MTJ sensor and\nMTJs array sensor in Wheatstone bridge were characterized and compared here.\nThe influence of hard-bias magnetic field on MR transfer curves of sing MTJ\nsensor and MTJs array sensor are investigated. The corresponding optimal\nhard-axis magnetic fields were obtained through Helmholtz coils to eliminate\nthe hysteresis for linear response of single MTJ sensor and MTJs array sensor.\n", "  We study higher dimensional scenarios of massive bigravity, which is a very\ninteresting extension of nonlinear massive gravity since its reference metric\nis assumed to be full dynamical. In particular, the Einstein field equations\nalong with the following constraint equations for both physical and reference\nmetrics of a five-dimensional massive bigravity will be addressed. Then, we\nstudy some well-known cosmological spacetimes such as the\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker, Bianchi type I, and\nSchwarzschild-Tangherlini metrics for the five-dimensional massive bigravity.\nAs a result, we find that massive graviton terms will serve as effective\ncosmological constants in both physical and reference sectors if a special\nscenario, in which reference metrics are chosen to be proportional to physical\nones, is considered for all mentioned metrics. Thanks to the constancy property\nof massive graviton terms, consistent cosmological solutions will be figured\nout accordingly.\n", "  We present a combination of the incremental expansion of potential energy\nsurfaces (PESs), known as n-mode expansion, with the incremental evaluation of\nthe electronic energy in a many-body approach. The application of semi-local\ncoordinates in this context allows the generation of PESs in a very\ncost-efficient way. For this, we employ the recently introduced flexible\nadaptation of local coordinates of nuclei (FALCON) coordinates. By introducing\nan additional transformation step, concerning only a fraction of the\nvibrational degrees of freedom, we can achieve linear scaling of the\naccumulated cost of the single point calculations required in the PES\ngeneration. Numerical examples of these double incremental approaches for\noligo-phenyl examples show fast convergence with respect to the maximum number\nof simultaneously treated fragments and only a modest error introduced by the\nadditional transformation step. The approach, presented here, represents a\nmajor step towards the applicability of vibrational wave function methods to\nsizable, covalently bound systems.\n", "  Large classes of materials systems in physics and engineering are governed by\nmagnetic and electrostatic interactions. Continuum or mesoscale descriptions of\nsuch systems can be cast in terms of integral equations, whose direct\ncomputational evaluation requires O(N^2) operations, where N is the number of\nunknowns. Such a scaling, which arises from the many-body nature of the\nrelevant Green's function, has precluded wide-spread adoption of integral\nmethods for solution of large-scale scientific and engineering problems. In\nthis work, a parallel computational approach is presented that relies on using\nscalable open source libraries and utilizes a kernel-independent Fast Multipole\nMethod to evaluate the integrals in O(N) operations, with O(N) memory cost,\nthereby substantially improving the scalability and efficiency of computational\nintegral methods. We demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of\nour approach in the contest of two examples. In the first, we solve a boundary\nvalue problem for a ferroelectric/ferromagnetic volume in free space. In the\nsecond, we solve an electrostatic problem involving polarizable dielectric\nbodies in an unbounded dielectric medium. The results from these test cases\nshow that our parallel approach, which is built on a kernel-independent FMM,\ncan enable highly efficient and accurate simulations and allow for considerable\nflexibility in a broad range of applications.\n", "  Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) materials have drawn significant interest\nbecause the enhanced toughness, shear resistance and vibration absorption that\ntypically are seen in auxetic materials may enable a range of novel\napplications. In this work, we report that single-layer graphene exhibits an\nintrinsic NPR, which is robust and independent of its size and temperature. The\nNPR arises due to the interplay between two intrinsic deformation pathways (one\nwith positive Poisson's ratio, the other with NPR), which correspond to the\nbond stretching and angle bending interactions in graphene. We propose an\nenergy-based deformation pathway criteria, which predicts that the pathway with\nNPR has lower energy and thus becomes the dominant deformation mode when\ngraphene is stretched by a strain above 6%, resulting in the NPR phenomenon.\n", "  Using current observations forecast type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) Joint\nLightcurve Analysis (JLA) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), in this paper\nwe investigate six bidimensional dark energy parameterisations in order to\nexplore which has more constraining power. Our results indicate that for\nparameterisations that contain $z^2$-terms, the tension ($\\sigma$-distance)\nbetween these datasets seems to be reduced and their behaviour are $<$1$\\sigma$\ncompatible with $\\Lambda$CDM. Also, the results obtained by performing their\nBayesian evidence show a striking evidence in favour of the $\\Lambda$CDM model,\nbut only one parameterisation can be distinguish by around $1\\%$ from the other\nmodels when the combination of datasets are considered.\n", "  The light elemental solutes B, C, N, and O can penetrate the surface of Mg\nalloys and diffuse during heat treatment or high temperature application,\nforming undesirable compounds. We investigate the diffusion of these solutes by\ndetermining their stable interstitial sites and the inter-penetrating network\nformed by these sites. We use density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the\nsite energies, migration barriers, and attempt frequencies for these networks\nto inform our analytical model for bulk diffusion. Due to the nature of the\nnetworks, O diffuses isotropically, while B, C, and N diffuse anisotropically.\nWe compute the elastodiffusion tensor which quantifies changes in diffusivity\ndue to small strains that perturb the diffusion network geometry and the\nmigration barriers. The DFT-computed elastic dipole tensor which quantifies the\nchange in site energies and migration barriers due to small strains is used as\nan input to determine the elastodiffusion tensor. We employ the elastodiffusion\ntensor to determine the effect of thermal strains on interstitial diffusion and\nfind that B, C, and N diffusivity increases on crystal expansion, while O\ndiffusivity decreases. From the elastodiffusion and compliance tensors we\ncalculate the activation volume of diffusion and find that it is positive and\nanisotropic for B, C and N diffusion, whereas it is negative and isotropic for\nO diffusion.\n", "  The possibility to have diquark configuration in heavy baryons, such as\nLambda_c and Lambda_b, is examined by a nonrelativistic potential model with a\nheavy quark and a light scalar diquark. Assuming that the Lambda_c and Lambda_b\nbaryons are composed of the heavy quark and the point-like scalar-isoscalar ud\ndiquark, we solve the two-body Schrodinger equation with the Coulomb plus\nlinear potential and obtain the energy spectra for the heavy baryons. Contrary\nto our expectation, it is found that the potential determined by the quarkonium\nspectra fails to reproduce the excitation spectra of the Lambda_c and Lambda_b\nin the quark-diquark picture, while the Lambda_c and Lambda_b spectra is\nreproduced with a half strength of the confinement string tension than for the\nquarkonium. The finite size effect of the diquark is also examined and it is\nfound that introduction of a finite size diquark would resolve the failure of\nthe spectrum reproduction. The Xi_c excitation energy is also calculated and is\nfound to be smaller than Lambda_c in the quark-diquark model. This is not\nconsistent with the experimental observation.\n", "  We demonstrate that a dipolar condensate can be prepared into a\nthree-dimensional wavepacket that remains localized when released in\nfree-space. Such self-bound states arise from the interplay of the two-body\ninteractions and quantum fluctuations. We develop a phase diagram for the\nparameter regimes where these self-bound states are stable, examine their\nproperties, and demonstrate how they can be produced in current experiments.\n", "  We perform molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the effect of\nhydrogenation on the Poisson's ratio of graphene. It is found that the value\nfor Poisson's ratio in graphene can be effectively tuned from positive to\nnegative by varying the percentage of hydrogenation. Specifically, the\nPoisson's ratio decreases with the increase of the percentage of hydrogenation,\nand reaches a minimum value of -0.04 at the percentage of hydrogenation about\n50%. The Poisson's ratio starts to increase with a further increase of the\npercentage of hydrogenation. The appearance of minimum negative Poisson's ratio\nin the hydrogenated graphene is attributed to the suppression of the\nhydrogenation-induced ripples during stretching of graphene. Our results\ndemonstrate that hydrogenation is a valuable approach for the tuning of the\nPoisson's ratio from positive to negative in graphene.\n", "  In this paper we analyze the energy evolution of the muon content of air\nshowers between $10^{18.4}$ and $10^{19.6}$ eV to be able to determine the most\nlikely mass composition scenario from future number of muons measurements. The\nenergy and primary mass evolution of the number of muons is studied based on\nthe Heitler-Matthews model and Monte Carlo simulation of the air shower. A\nsimple model to describe the evolution of the first and second moments of\nnumber of muons distributions is proposed and validated. An analysis approach\nbased on the comparison between this model's predictions and data to\ndiscriminate among a set of composition scenarios is presented and tested with\nsimulations. It is shown that the composition scenarios can be potentially\ndiscriminated under the conditions imposed by the method. The discrimination\npower of the proposed analysis is stable under systematic changes of the\nabsolute number of muons from model predictions and on the scale of the\nreconstructed energy.\n", "  In this paper, we study the third quantized super-group field cosmology, a\nmodel in multiverse scenario, in Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formulation. Further,\nwe propose the superfield/super-antifield dependent BRST symmetry\ntransformations. Within this formulation, we establish connection between the\ntwo different solutions of the quantum master equation within the BV\nformulation.\n", "  We show that the proper inclusion of soft reparameterization modes in the\nSachdev-Ye-Kitaev model of $N$ randomly interacting Majorana fermions reduces\nits long-time behavior to that of Liouville quantum mechanics. As a result, all\nzero temperature correlation functions decay with the universal exponent\n$\\propto \\tau^{-3/2}$ for times larger than the inverse single particle level\nspacing $\\tau\\gg N\\ln N$. In the particular case of the single particle Green\nfunction this behavior is manifestation of the zero-bias anomaly, or scaling in\nenergy as $\\epsilon^{1/2}$. We also present exact diagonalization study\nsupporting our conclusions.\n", "  We study the constraints on HST models of AdS space-time. The causal diamonds\nof HST along time-like geodesics of AdS space-time, fit nicely into the FRW\npatch of AdS space. The coordinate singularity of the FRW patch is identified\nwith the proper time at which the Hilbert space of the causal diamond becomes\ninfinite dimensional. For diamonds much smaller than the AdS radius, RAdS, the\ntime dependent Hamiltonians of HST are the same as those used to describe\nsimilar diamonds in Minkowski space. In particular, they are invariant under\nthe fuzzy analog of volume preserving diffeomorphisms of the holographic\nscreen, which leads to fast scrambling of perturbations on the horizon of a\nblack hole of size smaller than RAdS. We argue that, in order to take a limit\nof this system which converges to a CFT, one must choose Hamiltonians, in a\nrange of proper times of order RAdS, which break this invariance, and become\nlocal in a particular choice of basis for the variables. We show that,\nbeginning with flat, sub-RAdS, patches of dimension D, the resulting CFT,\nconstructed from the variables of HST, is inconsistent with the entropy of\nlarge black holes, unless one has at least two compact dimensions, whose size\nis of order RAdS. The argument is connected to a new observation about the\nscrambling rate of information localized on the compact dimensions. Our\nconstruction explains why large AdS black holes do not have the fast scrambling\nproperty. Our present approach cannot deal with models where string theory is\nweakly coupled and RAdS is of order the string scale, because the relationship\nbetween area and entropy is non-universal in such models. On spatial length\nscales longer than RAdS, our mapping of HST variables into CFT shares much with\nthe Tensor Network Renormalization Group (TNRG)[1] and is a sort of evolving\nerror correcting code[2].\n", "  We report the observation of ferromagnetic resonance-driven spin pumping\nsignals at room temperature in three-dimensional topological insulator thin\nfilms -- Bi2Se3 and (Bi,Sb)2Te3 -- deposited by molecular beam epitaxy on\nyttrium iron garnet thin films. By systematically varying the Bi2Se3 film\nthickness, we show that the spin-charge conversion efficiency, characterized by\nthe inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect length (lambda_IREE), increases\ndramatically as the film thickness is increased from 2 quintuple layers,\nsaturating above 6 quintuple layers. This suggests a dominant role of surface\nstates in spin and charge interconversion in topological insulator/ferromagnet\nheterostructures. Our conclusion is further corroborated by studying a series\nof YIG/(BiSb)2Te3 heterostructures. Finally, we use the ferromagnetic resonance\nlinewidth broadening and the inverse Rashba-Edelstein signals to determine the\neffective interfacial spin mixing conductance and lambda_IREE.\n", "  Calculations of synthetic spectropolarimetry are one means to test\nmulti-dimensional explosion models for Type Ia supernovae. In a recent paper,\nwe demonstrated that the violent merger of a 1.1 and 0.9 M$_{\\odot}$ white\ndwarf binary system is too asymmetric to explain the low polarization levels\ncommonly observed in normal Type Ia supernovae. Here, we present polarization\nsimulations for two alternative scenarios: the sub-Chandrasekhar mass\ndouble-detonation and the Chandrasekhar mass delayed-detonation model.\nSpecifically, we study a two-dimensional double-detonation model and a\nthree-dimensional delayed-detonation model, and calculate polarization spectra\nfor multiple observer orientations in both cases. We find modest polarization\nlevels ($<$ 1 per cent) for both explosion models. Polarization in the\ncontinuum peaks at $\\sim$ 0.1$-$0.3 per cent and decreases after maximum light,\nin excellent agreement with spectropolarimetric data of normal Type Ia\nsupernovae. Higher degrees of polarization are found across individual spectral\nlines. In particular, the synthetic Si ii {\\lambda}6355 profiles are polarized\nat levels that match remarkably well the values observed in normal Type Ia\nsupernovae, while the low degrees of polarization predicted across the O i\n{\\lambda}7774 region are consistent with the non-detection of this feature in\ncurrent data. We conclude that our models can reproduce many of the\ncharacteristics of both flux and polarization spectra for well-studied Type Ia\nsupernovae, such as SN 2001el and SN 2012fr. However, the two models considered\nhere cannot account for the unusually high level of polarization observed in\nextreme cases such as SN 2004dt.\n", "  Interacting two-dimensional electrons confined in a GaAs quantum well exhibit\nisotropic transport when the Fermi level resides in the first excited ($N=1$)\nLandau level. Adding an in-plane magnetic field ($B_{||}$) typically leads to\nan anisotropic, stripe-like (nematic) phase of electrons with the stripes\noriented perpendicular to the $B_{||}$ direction. Our experimental data reveal\nhow a periodic density modulation, induced by a surface strain grating from\nstrips of negative electron-beam resist, competes against the $B_{||}$-induced\norientational order of the stripe phase. Even a minute ($<0.25\\%$) density\nmodulation is sufficient to reorient the stripes along the direction of the\nsurface grating.\n", "  Understanding the interplay between charge order (CO) and other phenomena\n(e.g. pseudogap, antiferromagnetism, and superconductivity) is one of the\ncentral questions in the cuprate high-temperature superconductors. The\ndiscovery that similar forms of CO exist in both hole- and electron-doped\ncuprates opened a path to determine what subset of the CO phenomenology is\nuniversal to all the cuprates. Here, we use resonant x-ray scattering to\nmeasure the charge order correlations in electron-doped cuprates (La2-xCexCuO4\nand Nd2-xCexCuO4) and their relationship to antiferromagnetism, pseudogap, and\nsuperconductivity. Detailed measurements of Nd2-xCexCuO4 show that CO is\npresent in the x = 0.059 to 0.166 range, and that its doping dependent\nwavevector is consistent with the separation between straight segments of the\nFermi surface. The CO onset temperature is highest between x = 0.106 and 0.166,\nbut decreases at lower doping levels, indicating that it is not tied to the\nappearance of antiferromagnetic correlations or the pseudogap. Near optimal\ndoping, where the CO wavevector is also consistent with a previously observed\nphonon anomaly, measurements of the CO below and above the superconducting\ntransition temperature, or in a magnetic field, show that the CO is insensitive\nto superconductivity. Overall these findings indicate that, while verified in\nthe electron-doped cuprates, material-dependent details determine whether the\nCO correlations acquire sufficient strength to compete for the ground state of\nthe cuprates.\n", "  A bright optical flare was detected in the high-redshift ($z=2.133$) quasar\nCGRaBS J0809+5341 on 2014 April 13. The absolute magnitude of the object\nreached $-30.0$ during the flare, making it the brightest one (in flaring\nstage) among all known quasars so far. The 15 GHz flux density of CGRaBS\nJ0809+5341 monitored in the period from 2008 to 2016 also reached its peak at\nthe same time. To reveal any structural change possibly associated with the\nflare in the innermost radio structure of the quasar, we conducted a pilot very\nlong baseline interferometry (VLBI) observation of CGRaBS J0809+5341 using the\nEuropean VLBI Network (EVN) at 5 GHz on 2014 November 18, about seven months\nafter the prominent optical flare. Three epochs of follow-up KaVA (Korean VLBI\nNetwork and VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry Array) observations were\ncarried out at 22 and 43 GHz frequencies from 2015 February 25 to June 4, with\nthe intention of exploring a possibly emerging new radio jet component\nassociated with the optical flare. However, these high-resolution VLBI\nobservations revealed only the milliarcsecond-scale compact \"core\" that was\nknown in the quasar from earlier VLBI images, and showed no sign of any\nextended jet structure. Neither the size, nor the flux density of the \"core\"\nchanged considerably after the flare according to our VLBI monitoring. The\nresults suggest that any putative radio ejecta associated with the major\noptical and radio flare could not yet be separated from the \"core\" component,\nor the newly-born jet was short-lived.\n", "  The influence of periodic shear deformation on nonaffine atomic displacements\nin an amorphous solid is examined via molecular dynamics simulations. We study\nthe three-dimensional Kob-Andersen binary mixture model at a finite\ntemperature. It is found that when the material is periodically strained, most\nof the atoms undergo repetitive nonaffine displacements with amplitudes that\nare broadly distributed. We show that particles with large amplitudes of\nnonaffine displacements are organized into compact clusters. With increasing\nstrain amplitude, spatial correlations of nonaffine displacements become\nincreasingly long-ranged, although they remain present even in a quiescent\nsystem due to thermal fluctuations.\n", "  We consider effects of non-uniformity of quasi-spherical small black hole\nhorizons on scattering massless spineless particles in the long-wave\napproximation. Focusing on 4D flat and AdS neutral black hole backgrounds with\nconformally spherical geometry of the horizon, we observe the notable\ndifferences in compare to the scattering process on the spherically-symmetric\nblack holes. In particular, the absorption cross-section becomes dependent on\nboth, polar and azimuthal, spherical angles, projections of the angular\nmomentum do not keep anymore and the angular momentum operator by itself,\nthough remains quantised, is not quantised in integers. However, within the\nlong-wave approximation, the main conclusion of previously obtained results on\nscattering on the spherically-symmetric black holes remains the same: the total\nabsorption cross-section is proportional to the area of the black hole. The\nproportionality coefficient does not depend on the scalar wave frequency in the\nflat space black hole background, and is dependent on the admissible from the\nunitarity requirement frequencies in the background of AdS black hole. As a\nby-product of our studies we establish a quasi-spherical non-static Vaidya-type\nblack hole solutions and outline the relation between real solutions to the\nelliptic Liouville equation on 2D plane and on two-dimensional sphere.\n", "  Ultrathin two-dimensional semiconductors obtained from layered\ntransition-metal dichalcogenides such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) are\npromising for ultimately scaled transistors beyond Si. Although the shortening\nof the semiconductor channel is widely studied, the narrowing of the channel,\nwhich should also be important for scaling down the transistor, has been\nexamined to a lesser degree thus far. In this study, the impact of narrowing on\nmechanically exfoliated MoS2 flakes was investigated according to the\nchannel-width-dependent Schottky barrier heights at Cr/Au contacts. Narrower\nchannels were found to possess a higher Schottky barrier height, which is\nascribed to the edge-induced band bending in MoS2. The higher barrier heights\ndegrade the transistor performance as a higher electrode-contact resistance.\nTheoretical analyses based on Poisson's equation showed that the edge-induced\neffect can be alleviated by a high dopant impurity concentration, but this\nstrategy should be limited to channel widths of roughly 0.7 micrometers because\nof the impurity-induced charge-carrier mobility degradation. Therefore, proper\ntermination of the dangling bonds at the edges should be necessary for\naggressive scaling with layered semiconductors.\n", "  Despite its small size, the asteroid 4 Vesta has been completely\ndifferentiated to core and mantle. Its composition is similar to\nhowardite--eucrite--diogenite (HED) meteorites of which the detailed petrology\nis known. Therefore, Vesta is a good target for understanding the\ndifferentiation of terrestrial planets. A new differentiation model for crust\nformation has been developed by taking magma ocean fluid dynamics, chemical\nequilibrium, the presence of $^{26}$Al, and cooling into consideration with a\nspecial focus on crystal separation. The role of crystal size, thickness of the\nconductive lid, and fO$_{2}$ are evaluated as parameters. The results show that\nlarge crystals of at least 1 cm settled and formed a kilometer-thick cumulate\nlayer of orthopyroxene with Mg$\\#$ of 0.70-0.90 in ~20 thousand years, which\nalmost agrees with the Mg$\\#$ of diogenites. Smaller grain sizes formed thinner\nlayers.\n", "  The anharmonic phonon properties of SnSe in the Pnma phase were investigated\nwith a combination of experiments and first-principles simulations. Using\ninelastic neutron scattering (INS) and nuclear resonant inelastic X-ray\nscattering (NRIXS), we have measured the phonon dispersions and density of\nstates (DOS) and their temperature dependence, which revealed a strong,\ninhomogeneous shift and broadening of the spectrum on warming. First-principles\nsimulations were performed to rationalize these measurements, and to explain\nthe previously reported anisotropic thermal expansion, in particular the\nnegative thermal expansion within the Sn-Se bilayers. Including the anisotropic\nstrain dependence of the phonon free energy, in addition to the electronic\nground state energy, is essential to reproduce the negative thermal expansion.\nFrom the phonon DOS obtained with INS and additional calorimetry measurements,\nwe quantify the harmonic, dilational, and anharmonic components of the phonon\nentropy, heat capacity, and free energy. The origin of the anharmonic phonon\nthermodynamics is linked to the electronic structure.\n", "  The modified first laws of thermodynamics at the black hole horizon and the\ncosmological horizon of the Schwarzschild de Sitter black hole and the apparent\nhorizon of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology are derived by the surface\ntensions, respectively. The corresponding Smarr relations are obeyed. For the\nblack hole, the cosmological constant is first treated as a fixed constant, and\nthen as a variable associated to the pressure. The law at the apparent horizon\ntakes the same form as that at the cosmological horizon, but is different from\nthat at the black hole horizon. The positive temperatures guarantee the\nappearance of the worked terms in the modified laws at the cosmological and\napparent horizons. While they can disappear at the black hole horizon.\n", "  The IRIS Imager requires opt-mechanical stages which are operable under\nvacuum and cryogenic environment. Also the stage for the IRIS Imager is\nrequired to survive for 10 years without maintenance. To achieve these\nrequirements, we decided prototyping of a two axis stage with 80 mm clear\naperture. The prototype was designed as a double-deck stage, upper rotary stage\nand lower linear stage. Most of components are selected to take advantage of\nheritage from existing astronomical instruments. In contrast, mechanical\ncomponents with lubricants such as bearings, linear motion guides and ball\nscrews were modified to survive cryogenic environment. The performance proving\ntest was carried out to evaluate errors such as wobbling, rotary and linear\npositioning error. We achieved 0.002 $\\rm deg_{rms}$ wobbling, 0.08 $\\rm\ndeg_{0-p}$ rotational positioning error and 0.07 $\\rm mm_{0-p}$ translational\npositioning error. Also durability test under anticipated load condition has\nbeen conducted. In this article, we report the detail of mechanical design,\nfabrication, performance and durability of the prototype.\n", "  We study the prospects for using interferometers in gravitational-wave\ndetectors as tools to search for photon-sector violations of Lorentz symmetry.\nExisting interferometers are shown to be exquisitely sensitive to tiny changes\nin the effective refractive index of light occurring at frequencies around and\nbelow the microhertz range, including at the harmonics of the frequencies of\nthe Earth's sidereal rotation and annual revolution relevant for tests of\nLorentz symmetry. We use preliminary data obtained by the Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in 2006-2007 to place constraints on\ncoefficients for Lorentz violation in the photon sector exceeding current\nlimits by about four orders of magnitude.\n", "  Fast image reconstruction techniques are becoming important with the\nincreasing number of scientific cases in high resolution micro and nano\ntomography. The processing of the large scale three-dimensional data demands\nnew mathematical tools for the tomographic reconstruction task because of the\nbig computational complexity of most current algorithms as the sizes of\ntomographic data grow with the development of more powerful acquisition\nhardware and more refined scientific needs. In the present paper we propose a\nnew fast back-projection operator for the processing of tomographic data and\ncompare it against other fast reconstruction techniques.\n", "  The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is a planned gamma-ray observatory. CTA\nwill incorporate about 100 imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) at\na Southern site, and about 20 in the North. Previous IACT experiments have used\nup to five telescopes. Subsequently, the design of a graphical user interface\n(GUI) for the operator of CTA involves new challenges. We present a GUI\nprototype, the concept for which is being developed in collaboration with\nexperts from the field of Human-Computer Interaction. The prototype is based on\nWeb technology; it incorporates a Python web server, Web Sockets and graphics\ngenerated with the d3.js Javascript library.\n", "  Flow sensors have diverse applications in the field of biomedical engineering\nand also in industries. Micromachining of flow sensors has accomplished a new\ngoal when it comes to miniaturization. Due to the scaling in dimensions, power\nconsumption, mass cost, sensitivity and integration with other modules such as\nwireless telemetry has improvised to a great extent. Thermal flow sensors find\nwide applications in biomedical such as in hydrocephalus shunts and drug\ndelivery systems. Infrared thermal sensing is used for preclinical diagnosis of\nbreast cancer, for identifying various neurological disorders and for\nmonitoring various muscular movements. In this paper, various modes of thermal\nflow sensing and transduction methods with respect to different biomedical\napplications are discussed. Thermal flow sensing is given prime focus because\nof the simplicity in the design. Finally, a comparison of flow sensing\ntechnologies is also presented.\n", "  The aim of this study is to simulate the interaction of the solar wind with\nthe Hermean magnetosphere when the interplanetary magnetic field is weak,\nperforming a parametric study for all the range of hydrodynamic values of the\nsolar wind predicted on Mercury for the ENLIL + GONG WSA + Cone SWRC model:\ndensity from $12$ to $180$ cm$^{-3}$, velocity from $200$ to $500$ km/s and\ntemperatures from $2 \\cdot 10^4$ to $18 \\cdot 10^4$ K, and compare the results\nwith a real MESSENGER orbit as reference case. We use the code PLUTO in\nspherical coordinates and an asymmetric multipolar expansion for the Hermean\nmagnetic field. The study shows for all simulations a stand off distance larger\nthan the Mercury radius and the presence of close magnetic field lines on the\nday side of the planet, so the dynamic pressure of the solar wind is not high\nenough to push the magnetopause on the planet surface if the interplanetary\nmagnetic field is weak. The simulations with large dynamic pressure lead to a\nlarge compression of the Hermean magnetic field modifying its topology in the\ninner magnetosphere as well as the plasma flows from the magnetosheath towards\nthe planet surface.\n", "  The Kirchhoff law of thermal radiation, relating emissivity {\\epsilon} and\nabsorptance {\\alpha}, has been originally formulated for opaque bodies in\nthermodynamic equilibrium with the environment. However, in many systems of\npractical importance, both assumptions are often not satisfied. In this work,\nwe revisit the century-old law and examine the limits of its applicability in\nan example of Er:YAG and Er:YLF dielectric crystals, potential radiation\nconverters for thermophotovoltaic applications. In our experiments, the (80\nat.%) Er:YAG crystal was opaque between 1.45 {\\mu}m and 1.64 {\\mu}m. In this\nspectral range, its absorptance {\\alpha}({\\lambda}) is spectrally flat and\ndifferentiates from unity only by a small amount of reflection. The shape of\nthe emissivity spectrum {\\epsilon}({\\lambda}) closely matches that of\nabsorptance {\\alpha}({\\lambda}), suggesting that the Kirchhoff law can\nadequately describe thermal radiation of opaque bodies, even if the requirement\nof thermodynamic equilibrium is not satisfied. The(20 at.%) Er:YLF crystal had\nsmaller size, lower concentration of Er ions, and it was not opaque.\nNevertheless, its spectrum of emissivity {\\epsilon}({\\lambda}) had almost the\nsame shape (between 1.45 {\\mu}m and 1.62 {\\mu}m) as the spectrum of absorptance\n{\\alpha}({\\lambda}) derived from the transmission measurements. This\nobservation is in line with our prediction that the spectra of emissivity and\nabsorptance should have identical shapes in optically thin slabs. We, thus,\nshow that the Kirchhoff law of thermal radiation can be extended (with caution)\neven to not-opaque bodies away from the thermodynamic equilibrium.\n", "  We report on high-field angle-dependent magneto-transport measurements on\nepitaxial thin films of Bi2Se3, a three-dimensional topological insulator. At\nlow temperature, we observe quantum oscillations that demonstrate the\nsimultaneous presence of bulk and surface carriers. The magneto- resistance of\nBi2Se3 is found to be highly anisotropic. In the presence of a parallel\nelectric and magnetic field, we observe a strong negative longitudinal\nmagneto-resistance that has been consid- ered as a smoking-gun for the presence\nof chiral fermions in a certain class of semi-metals due to the so-called axial\nanomaly. Its observation in a three-dimensional topological insulator implies\nthat the axial anomaly may be in fact a far more generic phenomenon than\noriginally thought.\n", "  The two dimensional incompressible viscous flow past a flapping foil immersed\nin a uniform stream is studied numerically. Numerical simulations were\nperformed using a Lattice-Boltzmann model for moderate Reynolds numbers. The\ncomputation of the hydrodynamic force on the foil is related to the the wake\nstructure. In particular, when the foil's centre of mass is fixed in space,\nnumerical results suggest a relation between drag coefficient behaviour and the\nflapping frequency which determines the transition from the von K\\'arm\\'an\n(vKm) to the inverted von K\\'arm\\'an wake. Beyond the inverted vKm transition\nthe foil was released. Upstream swimming was observed at high enough flapping\nfrequencies. Computed hydrodynamic forces suggest the propulsion mechanism for\nthe swimming foil.\n", "  Lorentz invariance, the fundamental symmetry of Einstein's theory of Special\nRelativity, has been established and tested by many classical and modern\nexperiments. However, many theories that unify the Standard Model of particle\nphysics and General Relativity predict a violation of Lorentz invariance at the\nPlanck scale. While this energy range cannot be reached by current experiments,\nminute deviations from Lorentz symmetry may be present at lower energies.\nAstrophysical experiments are very suitable to search for these deviations,\nsince their effects accumulate as photons travel across large distances. In\nthis paper, we describe astrophysical methods that we used to constrain the\nphoton dispersion and vacuum birefringence.\n", "  Empirical evidence suggests that social structure may have changed from\nhierarchical to egalitarian and back along the evolutionary line of humans. We\nmodel a society subject to competing cognitive and social navigation\nconstraints. The theory predicts that the degree of hierarchy decreases with\nencephalization and increases with group size. Hence hominin groups may have\nbeen driven from a phase with hierarchical order to a phase with egalitarian\nstructures by the encephalization during the last two million years, and back\nto hierarchical due to fast demographical changes during the Neolithic. The\ndynamics in the perceived social network shows evidence in the egalitarian\nphase of the observed phenomenon of Reverse Dominance. The theory also predicts\nfor modern hunter-gatherers in mild climates a trend towards an intermediate\nhierarchy degree and a phase transition for harder ecological conditions. In\nharsher climates societies would tend to bemore egalitarian if organized in\nsmall groups but more hierarchical if in large groups. The theoretical model\npermits organizing the available data in the cross-cultural record\n(Ethnographic Atlas, N=248 cultures) where the symmetry breaking transition can\nbe clearly seen.\n", "  $\\alpha$-cluster correlations in the $0^+_1$ and $3^-_1$ states of $^{12}$C\nand $^{16}$O are studied using the method of antisymmetrized molecular\ndynamics, with which nuclear structures are described from nucleon degrees of\nfreedom without assuming existence of clusters. The intrinsic states of\n$^{12}$C and $^{16}$O have triangle and tetrahedral shapes, respectively,\nbecause of the $\\alpha$-cluster correlations. These shapes can be understood as\nspontaneous symmetry breaking of rotational invariance, and the resultant\nsurface density oscillation is associated with density wave (DW) caused by the\ninstability of Fermi surface with respect to particle-hole correlations with\nthe wave number $\\lambda=3$. $^{16}$O($0^+_1$) and $^{16}$O($3^-_1$) are\nregarded as a set of parity partners constructed from the rigid tetrahedral\nintrinsic state, whereas $^{12}$C($0^+_1$) and $^{12}$C($3^-_1$) are not good\nparity partners as they have triangle intrinsic states of different sizes with\nsignificant shape fluctuation because of softness of the $3\\alpha$ structure.\n$E3$ transition strengths from the $3^-_1$ to $0^+_1$ states in $^{12}$C and\n$^{16}$O are also discussed.\n", "  Metal nanoantennas supporting localized surface plasmon resonances have\nbecome an indispensable tool in bio(chemical) sensing and nanoscale imaging\napplications. The high plasmon-enhanced electric field intensity in the visible\nor near-IR range that enables the above applications may also cause local\nheating of nanoantennas. We present a design of hybrid optical-thermal antennas\nthat simultaneously enable intensity enhancement at the operating wavelength in\nthe visible and nanoscale local temperature control. We demonstrate a\npossibility to reduce the hybrid antenna operating temperature via enhanced\ninfrared thermal emission. We predict via rigorous numerical modeling that\nhybrid optical-thermal antennas that support high-quality-factor\nphotonic-plasmonic modes enable up to two orders of magnitude enhancement of\nlocalized electric fields and of the optical power absorbed in the nanoscale\nmetal volume. At the same time, the hybrid antenna temperature can be lowered\nby several hundred degrees with respect to its all-metal counterpart under\ncontinuous irradiance of 104-105 W/m2. The temperature reduction effect is\nattributed to the enhanced radiative cooling, which is mediated by the\nthermally-excited localized surface phonon polariton modes. We further show\nthat temperature reduction under even higher irradiances can be achieved by a\ncombination of enhanced radiative and convective cooling in hybrid antennas.\nFinally, we demonstrate how hybrid optical-thermal antennas can be used to\nachieve strong localized heating of nanoparticles while keeping the rest of the\noptical chip at low temperature.\n", "  By using the 3-point QCD sum rules, we calculate the transition form factors\nof $D$ decays into the spin triplet axial vector mesons $a_1(1260)$, $f_1(1285)\n$, $f_1(1420)$. In the calculations, we consider the quark contents of each\nmeson in detail. In view of the fact that the isospin of $a_1(1260)$ is one, we\ncalculate the $D^+ \\rightarrow a_1^0 (1260)$ and $D^0 \\rightarrow a_1^- (1260)$\ntransition form factors separately. In the case of $ f_1(1285), f_1(1420)$, the\nmixing between light flavor $SU(3)$ singlet and octet is taken into account.\nBased on the form factors obtained here, we give predictions for the branching\nratios of relevant semileptonic decays, which can be tested in the future\nexperiments.\n", "  We analyzed Suzaku/XIS data of 2006--2015 observations of a gamma-ray\nemitting radio galaxy NGC 1275, and brightening of the nucleus in the X-ray\nband was found in 2013--2015, correlating with GeV Gamma-ray brightening. This\nis the first evidence of variability with correlation between GeV gamma-ray and\nX-ray for NGC 1275. We also analyzed Swift/XRT data of NGC 1275, and found that\nX-ray was flaring by a factor of $\\sim$5 in several days in 2006, 2010, and\n2013. The X-ray spectrum during the flare was featureless and somewhat steeper\nwith a photon index of $\\sim$2 against $\\sim$1.7 in the normal state,\nindicating that a synchrotron component became brighter. A large Xray to GeV\ngamma-ray flux ratio in the flare could be explained by the shock-in-jet\nscenario. On the other hand, a long-term gradual brightening of radio, X-ray,\nand GeV gamma-ray with a larger gamma-ray amplitude could be origin of other\nthan internal shocks, and then we discuss some possibilities.\n", "  We analyze the baryonic semilepton decay $\\Lambda_{b} \\rightarrow$ $\\Lambda\n\\mu^{+} \\mu^{-}$ in the scalar leptoquark models with $X(3,2,7/6)$ and\n$X(3,2,1/6)$ states, respectively. We also discuss the effects of this two NP\nmodels on some physical observables. For some measured observables, like the\ndifferential decay width, the longitudinal polarization of the dilepton system,\nthe lepton-side forward-backward asymmetry and the baryon-side forward-backward\nasymmetry, we find, the prediction values of SM are consistent with the current\ndata in the most $q^{2}$ ranges, where the prediction values of this two NP\nmodels can also keep consistent with the current data with $1\\sigma$. However,\nin some $q^{2}$ ranges, the prediction values of SM are difficult to meet the\ncurrent data, but the contributions of this two NP models can meet them or keep\ncloser to them. For the double lepton polarization asymmetries, $P_{LT}$,\n$P_{TL}$, $P_{NN}$ and $P_{TT}$ are sensitive to the scalar leptoquark model\n$X(3,2,7/6)$ but not to $X(3,2,1/6)$. However, $P_{LN}$, $P_{NL}$, $P_{TN}$ and\n$P_{NT}$ are not sensitive to this two NP models.\n", "  We propose an effective and flexible scheme for reverse engineering of a\nHamiltonian by designing the evolution operators to eliminate the terms of\nHamiltonian which are hard to be realized in practice. Different from\ntransitionless quantum driving (TQD) [31], the present scheme is focus on only\none or parts of moving states in a D-dimension (D > 3) system. The numerical\nsimulation shows that the present scheme not only contains the results of TQD,\nbut also has more free parameters, which make this scheme more flexible. An\nexample is given by using this scheme to realize the population transfer for a\nRydberg atom. The influences of various decoherence processes are discussed by\nnumerical simulation and the result shows that the scheme is fast and robust\nagainst the decoherence and operational imperfection. Therefore, this scheme\nmay be used to construct a Hamiltonian which can be realized in experiments\n", "  Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in magnetic objects is of enormous\ninterest, because it generates a built-in chirality of magnetic domain walls\n(DWs) and topologically-protected skyrmions for efficient motion driven by\nspin-orbit torques. Because of its importance for perspective applications and\nacademic curiosities, many experimental efforts have been devoted to DMI\ninvestigation. However, current experimental probing techniques cover only\nlimited ranges of the DMI with specific sample requirements, and there are no\nversatile techniques covering a wide range of DMI. Here, we present a unique\nexperimental scheme to quantify DMI over a wide range based on the angular\ndependence of asymmetric DW motion. It can determine DMI even larger than the\nmaximum magnetic field strength, demonstrating that various strengths of DMI\ncan be quantified using a single measurement setup. This scheme provides a\nstandard technique over a wide range of DMI, which is essential to DMI-related\nemerging fields in nanotechnology.\n", "  The interaction of intense femtosecond laser pulses with atomic Argon\nclusters has been investigated by using nano-plasma model. Based on the dynamic\nsimulations, ionization process, heating and expansion of a cluster after\nirradiation by femtosecond laser pulses at intensities up to 2*1017 Wcm-2 are\nstudied. The analytical calculation provides ionization ratefor different\nmechanisms and time evolution of the density of electrons for different pulse\nshapes. In this approach the strong dependence of laser intensity, pulse\nduration and laser shape on the electron energy, the electron density and the\ncluster size are presented using the intense chirped laser pulses. Based on the\npresented theoretical modifications, the effect of chirped laser pulse on the\ncomplex dynamical process of the interaction is studied. It is found that the\nenergy of electrons and the radius of cluster for the negatively chirped\npulsesare improved up to 20% in comparison to the unchirped and positively\nchirped pulses.\n", "  The computational modelling of DNA is becoming crucial in light of new\nadvances in DNA nanotechnology, single-molecule experiments and in vivo DNA\ntampering. Here we present a mesoscopic model for double stranded DNA (dsDNA)\nat the single nucleotide level which retains the characteristic helical\nstructure, while being able to simulate large molecules -- up to a million base\npairs -- for time-scales which are relevant to physiological processes. This is\nmade possible by an efficient and highly-parallelised implementation of the\nmodel which we discuss here. We compare the behaviour of our model with single\nmolecule experiments where dsDNA is manipulated by external forces or torques.\nWe also present some results on the kinetics of denaturation of linear DNA.\n", "  Blood viscosity decreases with shear stress, a property essential for an\nefficient perfusion of the vascular tree. Shear-thinning is intimately related\nto the dynamics and mutual interactions of red blood cells (RBCs), the major\nconstituents of blood. Our work explores RBCs dynamics under physiologically\nrelevant conditions of flow strength, outer fluid viscosity and volume\nfraction. Our results contradict the current paradigm stating that RBCs should\nalign and elongate in the flow direction thanks to their membrane circulation\naround their center of mass, reducing flow-lines disturbances. On the contrary,\nwe observe both experimentally and with simulations, rich morphological\ntransitions that relate to global blood rheology. For increasing shear\nstresses, RBCs successively tumble, roll, deform into rolling stomatocytes and\nfinally adopt highly deformed and polylobed shapes even for semi-dilute volume\nfractions analogous to microcirculatory values. Our study suggests that any\npathological change in plasma composition, RBCs cytosol viscosity or membrane\nmechanical properties will impact the onset of shape transitions and should\nplay a central role in pathological blood rheology and flow behavior.\n", "  It is presently unknown how strong lattice potentials influence the fermion\nspectral function of the holographic strange metals predicted by the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. This embodies a crucial test for the application of holography\nto condensed matter experiments. We show that for one particular momentum\ndirection this spectrum can be computed for arbitrary strength of the effective\ntranslational symmetry breaking potential of the so-called Bianchi-VII geometry\nemploying ordinary differential equations. Deep in the strange metal regime we\nfind rather small changes to the single-fermion response computed by the\nemergent quantum critical IR, even when the potential becomes relevant in the\ninfra-red. However, in the regime where holographic quasi-particles occur,\ndefining a Fermi surface in the continuum, they acquire a finite lifetime at\nany finite potential strength. At the transition from irrelevancy to relevancy\nof the Bianchi potential in the deep infra-red the quasi-particle remnants\ndisappear completely and the fermion spectrum exhibits a purely relaxational\nbehaviour.\n", "  We report density functional theory (DFT) investigation of $B$-site doped\nCaFeO$_3$, a prototypical charge-ordered perovskite. At 290 K, CaFeO$_3$\nundergoes a metal-insulator transition and a charge disproportionation reaction\n2Fe$^{4+}$$\\rightarrow$Fe$^{5+}$+Fe$^{3+}$. We observe that when Zr dopants\noccupy a (001) layer, the band gap of the resulting solid solution increases to\n0.93 eV due to a 2D Jahn-Teller type distortion, where FeO$_6$ cages on the\n$xy$ plane elongate along $x$ and $y$ alternatively between neighboring Fe\nsites. Furthermore, we show that the rock-salt ordering of the Fe$^{5+}$ and\nFe$^{3+}$ cations can be enhanced when the $B$-site dopants are arranged in a\n(111) plane due to a collective steric effect that facilitates the size\ndiscrepancy between the Fe$^{5+}$O$_6$ and Fe$^{3+}$O$_6$ octahedra and\ntherefore gives rise to a larger band gap. The enhanced charge\ndisproportionation in these solid solutions is verified by rigorously\ncalculating the oxidation states of the Fe cations with different octahedral\ncage sizes. We therefore predict that the corresponding transition temperature\nwill increase due to the enhanced charge ordering and larger band gap. The\ncompositional, structural and electrical relationships exploited in this paper\ncan be extended to a variety of perovskites and non-perovskite oxides providing\nguidance in structurally manipulating electrical properties of functional\nmaterials.\n", "  In this thesis we contribute to the understanding of the pivotal role of the\ntemporal dimension in networked social systems, previously neglected and now\nuncovered by the data revolution recently blossomed in this field. To this aim,\nwe first introduce the time-varying networks formalism and analyze some\nempirical data of social dynamics, extensively used in the rest of the thesis.\nWe discuss the structural and temporal properties of human contact networks,\nsuch as heterogeneity and burstiness of social interactions, and we present a\nsimple model, rooted on social attractiveness, able to reproduce them. We then\nexplore the behavior of dynamical processes running on top of temporal\nnetworks, constituted by empirical face-to-face interactions, addressing in\ndetail the fundamental cases of random walks and epidemic spreading. We also\ndevelop an analytic approach able to compute the structural and percolation\nproperties of the activity driven model, aimed to describe a wide class of\nsocial interactions, driven by the activity of the individuals involved. Our\ncontribution in the rapidly evolving framework of social time-varying networks\nopens interesting perspectives for future work, such as the study of the impact\nof the temporal dimension on multi-layered systems.\n", "  Orthorhombic tungsten ditelluride (WTe2), with a distorted 1T structure,\nexhibits a large magnetoresistance that depends on the orientation, and its\nelectrical characteristics changes rom semimetallic to insulating as the\nthickness decreases. Through polarized Raman spectroscopy in combination with\ntransmission electron diffraction, we establish a reliable method to determine\nthe thickness and crystallographic orientation of few-layer WTe2. The Raman\nspectrum shows a pronounced dependence on the polarization of the excitation\nlaser. We found that the separation between two Raman peaks at ~90 cm-1 and at\n80-86 cm-1, depending on thickness, is a reliable fingerprint for determination\nof the thickness. For determination of the crystallographic orientation, the\npolarization dependence of the A1 modes, measured with the 632.8-nm excitation,\nturns out to be the most reliable. We also discovered that the polarization\nbehaviors of some of the Raman peaks depend on the excitation wavelength as\nwell as thickness, indicating a close interplay between the band structure and\nanisotropic Raman scattering cross section.\n", "  The search for highly efficient and low-cost catalysts is one of the main\ndriving forces in catalytic chemistry. Current strategies for the catalyst\ndesign focus on increasing the number and activity of local catalytic sites,\nsuch as the edge-sites of molybdenum disulfides in the hydrogen evolution\nreaction (HER). Here, we propose and demonstrate a different principle that\ngoes beyond local site optimization by utilizing topological electronic states,\na global property of the material, to spur catalytic activity. For HER, we have\nfound excellent catalysts among the transition-metal monopnictides - NbP, TaP,\nNbAs, and TaAs - which were recently discovered to be topological Weyl\nsemimetals. In addition to the free energy considerations we explore the role\nof metallicity, carrier mobility and topological electronic states for\nremarkable HER performance of these materials. The combination of robust\ntopological surface states and large room temperature carrier mobility both of\nwhich originate from bulk Dirac bands of the Weyl semimetal appears to be the\nrecipe for good HER catalyst. Our work provides a guiding principle for the\ndiscovery of novel catalysts from the emerging field of topological materials.\n", "  Stars in open clusters are expected to share an identical abundance pattern.\nEstablishing the level of chemical homogeneity in a given open cluster deserves\nfurther study as it is the basis of the concept of chemical tagging to unravel\nthe history of the Milky Way. M67 is particularly interesting given its solar\nmetallicity and age as well as being a dense cluster environment. We conducted\na strictly line-by-line differential chemical abundance analysis of two solar\ntwins in M67: M67-1194 and M67-1315. Stellar atmospheric parameters and\nelemental abundances were obtained with high precision using Keck/HIRES\nspectra. M67-1194 is essentially identical to the Sun in terms of its stellar\nparameters. M67-1315 is warmer than M67-1194 by ~ 150 K as well as slightly\nmore metal-poor than M67-1194 by ~ 0.05 dex. M67-1194 is also found to have\nidentical chemical composition to the Sun, confirming its solar twin nature.\nThe abundance ratios [X/Fe] of M67-1315 are similar to the solar abundances for\nelements with atomic number Z <= 30, while most neutron-capture elements are\nenriched by ~ 0.05 dex, which might be attributed to enrichment from a mixture\nof AGB ejecta and r-process material. The distinct chemical abundances for the\nneutron-capture elements in M67-1315 and the lower metallicity of this star\ncompared to M67-1194, indicate that the stars in M67 are likely not chemically\nhomogeneous. This poses a challenge for the concept of chemical tagging since\nit is based on the assumption of stars forming in the same star-forming\naggregate.\n", "  The new ZRP wind input source term (Zakharov et al. 2012) is checked for its\nconsistency via numerical simulation of Hasselmann equation. The results are\ncompared to field experimental data, collected at different sites around the\nworld, and theoretical predictions of self-similarity analysis. Good agreement\nis obtained for limited fetch and time domain statements\n", "  A high temperature for some catalytic reactions like synthesis of large area\nand high quality graphene is required. The mentioned graphene can be obtained\nby a chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process on copper foil at 800 1000. Here,\nwe describe a room temperature synthesis method from different carbon sources\nfor the first time, including acetylene, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, on\ncopper foil by using a heuristic method which was inspired from the role of\nsome electronic promoters in catalyst science. Promoters are substances that\nincrease the catalytic activity, but they are not catalysts by themselves. In\nthis study, we used charges to modify the electronic effects of the catalysts,\nwhich were produced by piezoelectric materials.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to study the plasma flows on the Mercury surface for\ndifferent interplanetary magnetic field orientations on the day side of the\nplanet. We use a single fluid MHD model in spherical coordinates to simulate\nthe interaction of the solar wind with the Hermean magnetosphere for six solar\nwind realistic configurations with different magnetic field orientations:\nMercury-Sun, Sun-Mercury, aligned with the magnetic axis of Mercury (Northward\nand Southward) and with the orbital plane perpendicular to the previous cases.\nIn the Mercury-Sun (Sun-Mercury) simulation the Hermean magnetic field is\nweakened in the South-East (North-East) of the magnetosphere leading to an\nenhancement of the flows on the South (North) hemisphere. For a Northward\n(Southward) orientation there is an enhancement (weakening) of the Hermean\nmagnetic field in the nose of the bow shock so the fluxes are reduced and\ndrifted to the poles (enhanced and drifted to the equator). If the solar wind\nmagnetic field is in the orbital plane the magnetosphere is tilted to the West\n(East) and weakened at the nose of the shock, so the flows are enhanced and\ndrifted to the East (West) in the Northern hemisphere and to the West (East) in\nthe Southern hemisphere.\n", "  The inertial (due to rotation) and gravitational fields of the Earth affect\nthe motion of an elementary particle and its spin dynamics. This influence is\nnot negligible and should be taken into account in high-energy physics\nexperiments. Earth's influence is manifest in perturbations in the particle\nmotion, in an additional precession of the spin, and in a change of the\nconstitutive tensor of the Maxwell electrodynamics. Bigger corrections are\noscillatory, and their contributions average to zero. Other corrections due to\nthe inhomogeneity of the inertial field are not oscillatory but they are very\nsmall and may be important only for the storage ring electric dipole moment\nexperiments. Earth's gravity causes the Newton-like force, the reaction force\nprovided by a focusing system, and additional torques acting on the spin.\nHowever, there are no observable indications of the electromagnetic effects due\nto Earth's gravity.\n", "  In this paper, we study relativistic bit commitment, which uses timing and\nlocation constraints to achieve information theoretic security. We consider the\n$F_Q$ multi-round bit commitment scheme introduced by Lunghi et al. [LKB+15].\nThis protocol was shown secure against classical adversaries as long as the\nnumber of rounds $m$ is small compared to $\\sqrt{Q}$ where $Q$ is the size of\nthe used field in the protocol [CCL15,FF16].\n  In this work, we study classical attacks on this scheme. We use classical\nstrategies for the $CHSH_Q$ game described in [BS15] to derive cheating\nstrategies for this protocol. In particular, our cheating strategy shows that\nif $Q$ is an even power of any prime, then the protocol is not secure when the\nnumber of rounds $m$ is of the order of $\\sqrt{Q}$. For those values of $Q$,\nthis means that the upper bound of [CCL15,FF16] is essentially optimal.\n", "  In the paper, a review of most important results of experimental studies of\nthermonuclear plasma in conical targets, generation of shock waves and\nspallation phenomena in different materials, which were carried out at laser\nfacilities of the A M Prokhorov General Physics Institute RAS since 1977, is\npresented.\n", "  Here, I review some recent works on magnetism of cool, main-sequence stars,\ntheir winds and potential impact on surrounding exoplanets. The winds of these\nstars are very tenuous and persist during their lifetime. Although carrying\njust a small fraction of the stellar mass, these magnetic winds carry away\nangular momentum, thus regulating the rotation of the star. Since cool stars\nare likely to be surrounded by planets, understanding the host star winds and\nmagnetism is a key step towards characterisation of exoplanetary environments.\nAs rotation and activity are intimately related, the spin down of stars leads\nto a decrease in stellar activity with age. As a consequence, as stars age, a\ndecrease in high-energy (X-ray, extreme ultraviolet) irradiation is observed,\nwhich can a ect the evaporation of exoplanetary atmospheres and, thus, also\naltering exoplanetary evolution.\n", "  An analytical framework is proposed to describe the elasticity, viscosity and\nfragility of metallic glasses in relation to their atomic-level structure and\nthe effective interatomic interaction. The bottom-up approach starts with\nforming an effective Ashcroft-Born-Mayer interatomic potential based on\nBoltzmann inversion of the radial distribution function g(r) and on fitting the\nshort-range part of $g(r)$ by means of a simple power-law approximation. The\npower exponent $\\lambda$ represents a global repulsion steepness parameter. A\nscaling relation between atomic connectivity and packing fraction $Z \\sim\n\\phi^{1+\\lambda}$ is derived. This relation is then implemented in a\nlattice-dynamical model for the high-frequency shear modulus where the\nattractive anharmonic part of the effective interaction is taken into account\nthrough the thermal expansion coefficient which maps the $\\phi$-dependence into\na $T$-dependence. The shear modulus as a function of temperature calculated in\nthis way is then used within the cooperative shear model of the glass\ntransition to yield the viscosity of the supercooled melt as a\ndouble-exponential function of $T$ across the entire Angell plot. The model,\nwhich has only one adjustable parameter (the characteristic atomic volume for\nhigh-frequency cage deformation) is tested against new experimental data of\nZrCu alloys and provides an excellent one-parameter description of the\nviscosity down to the glass transition temperature.\n", "  Some of the tools and techniques that have recently been used to compute\nHiggs boson pair production at NLO in QCD are discussed. The calculation relies\non the use of integral reduction, to reduce the number of integrals which must\nbe computed, and expressing the amplitude in terms of a quasi-finite basis,\nwhich simplifies their numeric evaluation. Emphasis is placed on sector\ndecomposition and Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration which are used to\nnumerically compute the master integrals.\n", "  Large-scale transmission radiography scanners are used to image vehicles and\ncargo containers. Acquired images are inspected for threats by a human operator\nor a computer algorithm. To make accurate detections, it is important that\nimage values are precise. However, due to the scale of such systems, they can\nbe mechanically unstable, causing the imaging array to wobble during a scan.\nThis leads to an effective loss of precision in the captured image. We consider\nthe measurement of wobble and amelioration of the consequent loss of image\nprecision. Following our previous work, we use Beam Position Detectors (BPDs)\nto measure the cross-sectional profile of the X-ray beam, allowing for\nestimation, and thus correction of wobble. We propose: (i) a model of image\nformation with a wobbling detector array; (ii) a method of wobble correction\nderived from this model; (iii) methods for calibrating sensor sensitivities and\nrelative offsets; (iv) a Random Regression Forest based method for\ninstantaneous estimation of detector wobble, and (v) using these estimates to\napply corrections to captured images of difficult scenes. We show that these\nmethods are able to correct for $87\\%$ of image error due wobble, and when\napplied to difficult images, a significant visible improvement in the\nintensity-windowed image quality is observed. The method improves the precision\nof wobble affected images, which should help improve detection of threats and\nthe identification of different materials in the image.\n", "  BaF2 (Barium fluoride) detector is one of the experiment facilities at the\nunder construction CSNS-WNS (White Neutron Source at China Spallation Neutron\nSource). It is designed for precisely measuring (n,gamma) cross section with\ntotal 92 crystal elements and completely 4 pi steradian coverage. In this\nproposal for readout electronics, waveform digitizing technique with 1GSps\nsampling rate and 12-bit resolution is adopted to precisely capture the\ndetector signal. To solve the problem of massive data readout and processing,\nthe readout electronics system is designed into a distributed architecture with\n4 PXIe crates. The digitized detector's signal is concentrated to PXIe crate\ncontroller through PCIe bus on backplane and transmitted to data acquisition\nsystem over Gigabit Ethernet in parallel. Besides, clock and trigger can be\nfanned out synchronously to each electronic channel over a high-precision\ndistributing network. Test results showed that the prototype of the readout\nelectronics system achieved good performance and cooperated well.\n", "  In the last decade, the development of theoretical methods have allowed\nchemists to reproduce and explain almost all of the experimental data\nassociated with elementary atom plus diatom collisions. However, there are\nstill a few examples where theory cannot account yet for experimental results.\nThis is the case for the preferential population of one of the\n$\\Lambda$-doublet states produced by chemical reactions. In particular, recent\nmeasurements of the OD($^2\\Pi$) product of the O($^3$P) + D$_2$ reaction have\nshown a clear preference for the $\\Pi(A')$ $\\Lambda$-doublet states, in\napparent contradiction with {\\em ab initio} calculations, which predict a\nlarger reactivity on the $A\"$ potential energy surface. Here we present a\nmethod to calculate the $\\Lambda$-doublet ratio when concurrent potential\nenergy surfaces participate in the reaction. It accounts for the experimental\n$\\Lambda$-doublet populations via explicit consideration of the stereodynamics\nof the process. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the propensity of the\n$\\Pi(A')$ state is a consequence of the different mechanisms of the reaction on\nthe two concurrent potential energy surfaces.\n", "  Electric-polarization reversibility in nano-ferroelectric structures renders\nthem as a convenient platform for exploring phase transitions and developing\nenergy-efficient switching devices. However, the fundamental question of how\nferroic domains switch, i.e. how the polarization changes from one state to\nanother, is yet to be answered fully. There are contradicting models and a wide\nbody of accumulated data which disagree as to whether the switching requires\ndomain nucleation. Moreover, ferroelectric domains switch under electric fields\nthat are supposedly too weak to form nucleation sites, indicating that the\nlevel of disorder seen in real systems plays an important role. This\nlongstanding so-called Landauer's paradox is the ferroelectric equivalent to\nthe absence of raindrop formation in a dust-free vacuum, leading to\nsupersaturated vapors that cannot exist otherwise, e.g. in spinodal\ndecompositions or inhomogeneous nucleation environments. Here we show that\npolarization switching in ferroelectric-ferroelastic systems comprises domain\ntypes that differ by symmetry, lengthscale and switching energy. These domains\nswitch simultaneously thanks to intermediate-range order of organized pinning\nsites, supporting the previously-unexplained coexistence of\nnucleation-and-growth and nucleation-frustrated mechanisms. Our treatment is\napplicable to other Kolmogorov-Avrami systems with multi-scale phase\ntransitions. Finally, we demonstrate augmented electromechanical coupling based\non the collective motion of pinning sites, which is promising for nano\nelectro-mechanical and low-power switching devices.\n", "  The main result of this paper is the explicit computation of the equations\ndefining the moduli space of triples $(C,p,z)$ (where $C$ is an integral and\ncomplete algebraic curve, $p$ a smooth rational point and $z$ a formal\ntrivialization around $p$) in the infinite Grassmannian of $k((t))$. This is\nachieved by introducing infinite Grassmannians, tau and Baker-Ahkiezer\nfunctions algebraically and by proving an Addition Formula for tau functions.\n", "  We present the first X-ray spectrum obtained by the Low Energy Transmission\nGrating Spectrometer (LETGS) aboard the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The spectrum\nis of Capella and covers a wavelength range of 5-175 A (2.5-0.07 keV). The\nmeasured wavelength resolution, which is in good agreement with ground\ncalibration, is $\\Delta \\lambda \\simeq$ 0.06 A (FWHM). Although in-flight\ncalibration of the LETGS is in progress, the high spectral resolution and\nunique wavelength coverage of the LETGS are well demonstrated by the results\nfrom Capella, a coronal source rich in spectral emission lines. While the\nprimary purpose of this letter is to demonstrate the spectroscopic potential of\nthe LETGS, we also briefly present some preliminary astrophysical results. We\ndiscuss plasma parameters derived from line ratios in narrow spectral bands,\nsuch as the electron density diagnostics of the He-like triplets of carbon,\nnitrogen, and oxygen, as well as resonance scattering of the strong Fe XVII\nline at 15.014 A.\n", "  A study of AM Her low states in September 1990 and 1991 and June-July 1997 is\nreported from a coordinated campaign with observations obtained at the\nHaute-Provence observatory, at the 6-m telescope of the Special Astrophysical\nObservatory and at the 2.6m and 1.25m telescopes of the Crimean observatory.\nSpectra obtained at different dates when the source was in low states at a\ncomparable V magnitude, show the presence of strong Zeeman absorption features\nand marked changes in emission lines with a day-to-day reappearance of the HeII\n(4686\\AA) emission lines in 1991. Despite this variability, the magnetic field\ninferred from the fitting of the absorption spectrum with Zeeman hydrogen\nsplitting, is remarkably constant with a best value of (12.5$\\pm$0.5)MG.\nDetailed analysis of the UBVRI light curves shows the presence of repetitive\nmoderate amplitude ($\\sim$ 0.3-0.5 mag) flares predominantly red in colour.\nThese flares are attributed to small accretion events and are compared to the\nlarge ($\\sim$ 2 mag.) blue flare reported by Shakhovskoy et al. (1993). We\nsuggest that the general flaring activity observed during the low states is\ngenerated by accretion events. The different characteristics of the flares\n(colour and polarization) are the results of different shock geometries\ndepending on the net mass accretion flux.\n", "  We use large-scale cosmological simulations to estimate the mass-to-light\nratio of galaxy systems as a function of scale, and compare the results with\nobservations of galaxies, groups, clusters, and superclusters of galaxies. We\nfind remarkably good agreement between observations and simulations.\nSpecifically, we find that the simulated mass-to-light ratio increases with\nscale on small scales and flattens to a constant value on large scales, as\nsuggested by observations. We find that while mass typically follows light on\nlarge scales, high overdensity regions --- such as rich clusters and\nsuperclusters of galaxies --- exhibit higher M/L_B values than average, while\nlow density regions exhibit lower M/L_B values; high density regions are thus\nantibiased in M/L_B, with mass more strongly concentrated than blue light. This\nis true despite the fact that the galaxy mass density is unbiased or positively\nbiased relative to the total mass density in these regions. The M/L_B antibias\nis likely due to the relatively old age of the high density regions, where\nlight has declined significantly since their early formation time, especially\nin the blue band which traces recent star formation. Comparing the simulated\nresults with observations, we place a powerful constraint on the mass density\nof the universe; using, for the first time, the entire observed mass-to-light\nfunction, from galaxies to superclusters, we find Omega =0.16+/-0.05.\n", "  The relation between the cosmological evolution of the jet-disk symbiosis\nmodel for GRBs and the cosmic rays energy distribution is presented. We used\ntwo different Star Formation Rates (SFR) as a function of redshift and a\nLuminosity Function (LF) distribution to obtain the distribution in fluence of\nGRBs in our model and compare it with the data. We show a good agreement\nbetween the fluence distribution we obtain and the corrected data for the 4B\nBATSE catalogue. The results we obtain are generally valid for models that use\njet physics to explain GRB properties. The fluence in the gamma ray band has\nbeen used to calculate the energy in cosmic rays both in our Galaxy and at\nextragalactic distances as a function of the redshift. This energy input has\nbeen compared with the Galactic and extragalactic spectrum of cosmic rays and\nneutrinos. Using our jet disk symbiosis model, we found that in both cases GRBs\ncannot give any significant contribution to cosmic rays. We also estimate the\nneutrino background, obtaining a very low predicted flux. We also show that the\nfit of our model with the corrected fluence distribution of GRBs gives strong\nconstraints of the star formation rate as a function of the redshift.\n", "  Several facts regarding the structure of NGC 604 are examined here. The three\nmain cavities, produced by the mechanical energy from massive stars which in\nNGC 604 are spread over a volume of 10$^6$ pc$^3$, are shown here to be\nundergoing blowout into the halo of M33. High resolution long slit spectroscopy\nis used to track the impact from massive stars while HST archive data is used\nto display the asymmetry of the nebula.\n  NGC 604 is found to be a collection of photoionized filaments and sections of\nshells in direct contact with the thermalized matter ejected by massive stars.\nThe multiple blowout events presently drain the energy injected by massive\nstars and thus the densest photoionized gas is found almost at rest and is\nexpected to suffer a slow evolution.\n", "  We reveal unifying thermodynamic aspects of so different phenomena as the\ncosmological electron-positron annihilation, the evaporation of primordial\nblack holes with a narrow mass range, and the ``deflationary'' transition from\nan initial de Sitter phase to a subsequent standard\nFriedmann-Lema\\^{\\i}tre-Robertson-Walker begin (FLRW) behavior.\n", "  At high gluon or string densities, gluons' saturation or the strong\ninteraction among strings, either forming colour ropes or giving rise to\nstring's percolation, induces a strong suppression in the particle\nmultiplicities produced at high energy. This suppression implies important\nmodifications on cosmic ray shower development. In particular, it is shown that\nit affects the depth of maximum, the elongation rate, and the behaviour of the\nnumber of muons at energies around 10^{17}-10^{18} eV. The existing cosmic ray\ndata point out in the same direction.\n", "  We present a comparison of halo properties in cosmological simulations of\ncollisionless cold dark matter (CDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM)\nfor a range of dark matter cross sections. We find, in agreement with various\nauthors, that CDM yields cuspy halos that are too centrally concentrated as\ncompared to observations. Conversely, SIDM simulations using a Monte Carlo\nN-body technique produce halos with significantly reduced central densities and\nflatter cores with increasing cross section. We introduce a concentration\nparameter based on enclosed mass that we expect will be straightforward to\ndetermine observationally, unlike that of Navarro, Frenk & White, and provide\npredictions for SIDM and CDM. SIDM also produces more spherical halos than CDM,\nproviding possibly the strongest observational test of SIDM. We discuss our\nfindings in relation to various relevant observations as well as SIDM\nsimulations of other groups. Taking proper account of simulation limitations,\nwe find that a dark matter cross section per unit mass of sigma_DM ~=\n10^{-23}-10^{-24} cm^2/GeV is consistent with all current observational\nconstraints.\n", "  We present new H alpha and [O III] 5007 narrow band images of the\nstarbursting dwarf galaxy NGC 4214, obtained with the WFPC2 onboard HST,\ntogether with VLA observations of the same galaxy. The HST images resolve\nfeatures down to physical scales of 2-5 pc, revealing several young (<10 Myr)\nstar forming complexes of various ionized gas morphologies (compact knots,\ncomplete or fragmentary shells) and sizes (10-200 pc). Our results are\nconsistent with a uniform set of evolutionary trends: The youngest, smaller,\nfilled regions that presumably are those just emerging from dense star forming\nclouds, tend to be of high excitation and are highly obscured. Evolved, larger\nshell-like regions have lower excitation and are less extincted due of the\naction of stellar winds and supernovae. In at least one case we find evidence\nfor induced star formation which has led to a two-stage starburst. Age\nestimates based on W(H alpha) measurements do not agree with those inferred\nfrom wind-driven shell models of expanding H II regions. The most likely\nexplanation for this effect is the existence of a 2 Myr delay in the formation\nof superbubbles caused by the pressure exerted by the high density medium in\nwhich massive stars are born. We report the detection of a supernova remnant\nembedded in one of the two large H II complexes of NGC 4214. The dust in NGC\n4214 is not located in a foreground screen but is physically associated with\nthe warm ionized gas.\n", "  This work presents three dimensional, magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of\nthe formation and early evolution of a subgroup of planetary nebulae that\nexhibit a variety of point-symmetric structures. For bipolar nebulae, the\nformation of point-symmetric nebular shapes along the inner borders of their\nopposing lobes and/or collimated outflows or jets internal or external to their\ncavities, is reproduced by considering a steady misalignment of the magnetic\ncollimation axis with respect to the symmetry axis of the bipolar wind outflow,\ndefined perpendicular to the equatorial density enhancement. Elliptical\nplanetary nebulae with ansae displaced from the symmetry axis in\npoint-symmetric fashion are reproduced through the same process by reducing the\nequatorial density enhancement. This mechanism represents an alternative\nexplanation to some cases where morphological appearances give the impression\nof the action of a symmetric, rotating or precessing jet from the central\nsource. The computational survey reveals that jet formation is detected only\nfor dense enough winds with mass loss rates $\\gtrsim 10^{-7}$ \\Moy. For lower\nmass loss rates the jets tend to vanish leaving behind only ansae-like\nstructures at the tips of the lobes, as observed in some cases. The results are\nrather independent of the wind terminal velocity, since magnetized bubbles\nbehave adiabatically for low wind velocities ($\\simeq$ $100 \\kms$), which in\nthe absence of a magnetic field would behave as momentum driven.\n", "  Approximately 30-40% of all baryons in the present day universe reside in a\nwarm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), with temperatures between 10^5<T<10^7 K.\nThis is a generic prediction from six hydrodynamic simulations of currently\nfavored structure formation models having a wide variety of numerical methods,\ninput physics, volumes, and spatial resolutions. Most of these warm-hot baryons\nreside in diffuse large-scale structures with a median overdensity around\n10-30, not in virialized objects such as galaxy groups or galactic halos. The\nevolution of the WHIM is primarily driven by shock heating from gravitational\nperturbations breaking on mildly nonlinear, non-equilibrium structures such as\nfilaments. Supernova feedback energy and radiative cooling play lesser roles in\nits evolution. WHIM gas is consistent with observations of the 0.25 keV X-ray\nbackground without being significantly heated by non-gravitational processes\nbecause the emitting gas is very diffuse. Our results confirm and extend\nprevious work by Cen & Ostriker and Dave' et al.\n", "  In this paper the Stewart-Lyth inverse problem is introduced. It consists of\nsolving two non-linear differential equations for the first slow-roll parameter\nand finding the inflaton potential. The equations are derived from the\nStewart--Lyth equations for the scalar and tensorial perturbations produced\nduring the inflationary period. The geometry of the phase planes transverse to\nthe trajectories is analyzed, and conclusions about the possible behaviour for\ngeneral solutions are drawn.\n", "  We present ISO (Infrared Space Observatory) observations of the planetary\nnebula Lindsay 305 (L 305) in the Small Magellanic Cloud. L 305 is very\nprominent in the ISOCAM frames at 6.75 and 11.5 $\\mu$m, although it is under\nthe detection limit at 4.5 $\\mu$m. The obtained spectral energy distribution\nshows a strong mid-IR excess, which, depending on the amount of energy radiated\nat wavelengths longer than 11.5 $\\mu$m, may be as large as $\\sim 1500\nL_{\\odot}$. However, since an accurate estimate of the total nebular luminosity\nis not available up to date, the evolutionary status of L 305 can not yet be\nconstrained precisely.\n", "  We present a brief summary of the ISO survey of AGB stars in 8 populous\nintermediate age clusters of the Magellanic Clouds. Totally, more than 100 AGB\nand RGB stars were observed at 4.5, 6.7 and 12 $\\mu$m. We introduce a new\nmethod to estimate effective temperatures of oxygen-rich AGB stars, and derive\nprecise bolometric magnitudes and effective temperatures for a large population\nof AGB objects in both LMC and SMC. The derived stellar parameters are used to\nconstruct observed HR diagrams which are employed further to estimate cluster\nages using the isochrone fitting. We show that proposed method gives a powerful\ntool to study AGB star populations within the Local Group galaxies, especially,\nwhen backed up with the observations from forthcoming mid-IR astronomical space\nfacilities (IRIS, SIRTF) and large ground-based telescopes (SUBARU, VLT, etc.).\n", "  The morphology of the X-ray and radio emitting features in the central $\\sim$\n50 kpc region around the galaxy M87 strongly suggests that buoyant bubbles of\ncosmic rays (inflated by an earlier nuclear active phase of the galaxy) rise\nthrough the cooling gas at roughly half the sound speed. In the absence of\nstrong surface tension, initially spherical bubbles will transform into tori as\nthey rise through an external medium. Such structures can be identified in the\nradio images of the halo of M87. During their rise, bubbles will uplift\nrelatively cool X-ray emitting gas from the central regions of the cooling flow\nto larger distances. This gas is colder than the ambient gas and has a higher\nvolume emissivity. As a result, rising ``radio'' bubbles may be trailed by\nelongated X-ray features as indeed is observed in M87. We performed simple\nhydrodynamic simulations to qualitatively illustrate the evolution of buoyant\nbubbles in the M87 environment.\n", "  In this paper the Stewart-Lyth inverse problem is rewritten using the\ncomoving scales as the basic parameter. It is shown that some information on\nthe inflaton potential can be obtained from observations taking into account\nonly the scalar power spectrum.\n", "  We present very deep and accurate photometry of the open cluster M35 (VRIc\nfilters). We have covered a region of 27.5x27.5 square arcmin.\n  The data range from Ic=12.5 to 23.5 mag, and the color intervals are\n0.4\\le(V-I)c\\le3.0, 0.5\\le(R-I)c\\le2.5. Roughly, these values span from 1.6\nM_\\odot down to the substellar limit. By using the location of the stars on\ncolor-magnitude and color-color diagrams, we have selected candidate members of\nthis cluster. We have merged our sample with previously published data and\nobtained a color-magnitude diagram for the complete stellar population of the\ncluster, covering the spectral range early B - mid M. The Mass Function\nincreases monotonically, when plotted in a log-log form, until it reaches ~0.8\nM_\\odot (\\alpha=2.59). It remains shallower for less massive stars (\\alpha=0.81\nfor 0.8-0.2 M_\\odot), whereas a decrease ins observed for stars close to the\nsubstellar regime. The total mass of the cluster is ~1600 M_\\odot in the area\ncovered by this study.\n", "  We have identified a large sample of probable low mass members of the young\nopen cluster IC2391 based on optical (VRIZ) and Infrared (JHK$_s$) photometry.\nOur sample includes 50 probable members and 82 possible members, both very low\nmass stars and brown dwarfs. We also provide accurate positions for these stars\nand brown dwarf candidates derived from red UK Schmidt plates measured using\nthe microdensitometer SuperCOSMOS. Assuming an age of 53 Myr, we estimate that\nwe have reached a mass of 0.025 M$_\\odot$, if the identified objects are indeed\nmembers of IC2391.\n", "  We present the first measurement of temperature and polarization angular\npower spectra of the diffuse emission of Galactic dust at 353 GHz as seen by\nArcheops on 20% of the sky. The temperature angular power spectrum is\ncompatible with that provided by the extrapolation to 353 GHz of IRAS and DIRBE\nmaps using \\cite{fds} model number 8. For Galactic latitudes $|b| \\geq 5$ deg\nwe report a 4 sigma detection of large scale ($3\\leq \\ell \\leq 8$)\ntemperature-polarization cross-correlation $(\\ell+1)C_\\ell^{TE}/2\\pi = 76\\pm 21\n\\mu\\rm{K_{RJ}}^2$ and set upper limits to the $E$ and $B$ modes at $11\n\\mu\\rm{K_{RJ}}^2$. For Galactic latitudes $|b| \\geq 10$ deg, on the same\nangular scales, we report a 2 sigma detection of temperature-polarization\ncross-correlation $(\\ell+1)C_\\ell^{TE}/2\\pi = 24\\pm 13 \\mu\\rm{K_{RJ}}^2$. These\nresults are then extrapolated to 100 GHz to estimate the contamination in CMB\nmeasurements by polarized diffuse Galactic dust emission. The $TE$ signal is\nthen $1.7\\pm0.5$ and $0.5\\pm0.3 \\mu\\rm{K^2_{CMB}}$ for $|b| \\geq 5$ and 10 deg.\nrespectively. The upper limit on $E$ and $B$ becomes $0.2 \\mu\\rm{K^2_{CMB}}\n(2\\sigma)$. If polarized dust emission at higher Galactic latitude cuts is\nsimilar to the one we report here, then dust polarized radiation will be a\nmajor foreground for determining the polarization power spectra of the CMB at\nhigh frequencies above 100 GHz.\n", "  We show that Be stars belong to a high velocity tail of a single B-type star\nrotational velocity distribution in the MS. This implies that: 1) the number\nfraction N(Be)/N(Be+B) is independent of the mass; 2) Bn stars having ZAMS\nrotational velocities higher than a given limit might become Be stars.\n", "  Using 2D models of rotating stars, the interferometric measurements of alpha\nEri and its fundamental parameters corrected for gravitational darkening\neffects we infer that the star might have a core rotating 2.7 times faster than\nthe surface. We explore the consequences on spectral lines produced by surface\ndifferential rotation combined with the effects due to a kind of internal\ndifferential rotation with rotational energies higher than allowed for rigid\nrotation which induce geometrical deformations that do not distinguish strongly\nfrom those carried by the rigid rotation.\n", "  Emission lines formed in the circumstellar envelopes of several type of stars\ncan be modeled using first principles of line formation. We present simple ways\nof calculating line emission profiles formed in circumstellar envelopes having\ndifferent geometrical configurations. The fit of the observed line profiles\nwith the calculated ones may give first order estimates of the physical\nparameters characterizing the line formation regions: opacity, size, particle\ndensity distribution, velocity fields, excitation temperature.\n", "  Fast rotation seems to be the mayor factor to trigger the Be phenomenon.\nSurface fast rotation can be favored by initial formation conditions, such as\nabundance of metals. We have observed 118 Be stars up to the apparent\nmagnitudes V=9 mag. Models of fast rotating atmospheres and evolutionary tracks\nwere used to interpret the stellar spectra and to determine the stellar\nfundamental parameters. Since the studied stars are formed in regions that are\nseparated enough to imply some non negligible gradient of galactic metallicity,\nwe study the effects of possible incidence of this gradient on the nature as\nrotators of the studied stars.\n", "  Cold molecular gas has recently been found is several cooling flow clusters\ncores with single dish telescopes. High spatial resolution imaging of some of\nthese clusters then revealed the peculiar morphology and dynamics of the CO\nemission lines, pointing out a perturbed very cold component in the cluster\ncenters. We report here the observations of NGC 1275, in the Perseus cluster of\ngalaxies. This object is the strongest cooling flow emitter in the millimeter.\nThe 9 dual polarization pixels of the HERA focal plane array, installed on the\n30m telescope, enabled to image the large scale emission of the cold molecular\ngas which is found to follow the very peculiar Halpha filamentary structure\naround the central galaxy. We discuss here this association and the\nnon-rotating dynamics of the cold gas that argue for a cooling flow origin of\nthe molecular component.\n", "  We propose an improved version of the redshift indicator developed by Atteia\n(2003), which gets rid of the dependence on the burst duration and provides\nbetter estimates for high-redshift GRBs. We present the derivation and the\ndefinition of this redshift indicator, then its calibration with 17 GRBs with\nknown redshifts detected by HETE-2 and 2 more detected by Konus-Wind. We also\nprovide an estimation of the redshift for 59 bursts, and we finally discuss the\nredshift distribution of HETE-bursts and the possible other applications of\nthis redshift indicator.\n", "  We analyze {\\it Spitzer} and Magellan observations of a star forming core\nnear IRS-2 in the young cluster NGC 2264. The submillimeter source IRAS 12 S1,\npreviously believed to be an intermediate mass Class 0 object is shown to be a\ndense collection of embedded, low mass stars. We argue that this group of stars\nrepresents the fragmenting collapse of a dense, turbulent core, based on a\nnumber of indicators of extreme youth. With reasonable estimates for the\nvelocity dispersion in the group, we estimate a dynamical lifetime of only a\nfew x 10$^{4}$ years. Spectral energy distributions of stars in the core are\nconsistent with Class I or Class 0 assignments. We present observations of an\nextensive system of molecular hydrogen emission knots. The luminosity of the\nobjects in the core region are consistent with roughly solar mass protostars.\n", "  We studied the circumstellar environment of the B[e] star HD 45677 through\nthe analysis of the emission lines from ionized metals. We used the statistical\napproach of the self absorption curve method (SAC) to derive physical\nparameters of the line emitting region. The Fe II and Cr II double-peaked\nemission line structure is explained by the presence of a thin absorption\ncomponent red shifted by ~3 km/s. This absorption component can be interpreted\ngeometricaly as being due to infalling material perpendicularly to the disk\nseen nearly pole-on, as indicated by the emission line structure. The Cr II and\nFe II emission lines have a complex structure with two (narrow and broad)\ncomponents, of 45 and 180 km/s FWHM for the permitted lines and 25 and 100 km/s\nFWHM for the forbidden ones, respectively. We argue that the narrow components\nare principaly emitted by an optically thin disk seen nearly pole-on, in a\nregion whose minimum radius is estimated to be 4 10^12 cm, while the broad ones\nare formed in a disk-linked wind.\n", "  Tsiklauri et al. recently published a theoretical model of electron\nacceleration by Alfv\\'en waves in a nonuniform collisionless plasmas. We\ncompare their work with a series of results published earlier by an another\nteam, of which Tsiklauri et al. were probably unaware. We show that these two\nseries of works, apparently conducted independently, lead to the same\nconclusions. This reinforces the theoretical consistency of the model.\n", "  Results: We report the detection of broad HCO+(1-0) lines (10 mK < T < 0.5\nK). The interpretation of 10 of the HCO+ velocity components is conducted in\nconjunction with that of the associated optically thin 13CO emission. The\nderived HCO+ column densities span a broad range, $10^{11}< N(HCO+)/\\Delta v <4\n\\times 10^{12} \\rm cm^2/(km/s^{-1}$, and the inferred HCO+ abundances, $2\n\\times 10^{-10}<X(HCO+) < 10^{-8}$, are more than one order of magnitude above\nthose produced by steady-state chemistry in gas weakly shielded from UV\nphotons, even at large densities. We compare our results with the predictions\nof non-equilibrium chemistry, swiftly triggered in bursts of turbulence\ndissipation and followed by a slow thermal and chemical relaxation phase,\nassumed isobaric. The set of values derived from the observations, i.e. large\nHCO+ abundances, temperatures in the range of 100--200 K and densities in the\nrange 100--1000 cm3, unambiguously belongs to the relaxation phase. The\nkinematic properties of the gas suggest in turn that the observed HCO+ line\nemission results from a space-time average in the beam of the whole cycle\nfollowed by the gas and that the chemical enrichment is made at the expense of\nthe non-thermal energy. Last, we show that the \"warm chemistry\" signature (i.e\nlarge abundances of HCO+, CH+, H20 and OH) acquired by the gas within a few\nhundred years, the duration of the impulsive chemical enrichment, is kept over\nmore than thousand years. During the relaxation phase, the \\wat/OH abundance\nratio stays close to the value measured in diffuse gas by the SWAS satellite,\nwhile the OH/HCO+ ratio increases by more than one order of magnitude.\n", "  <b>Aims:</b> We analyse the magnetic field geometry of the magnetic DA white\ndwarf PG 1015+014 with our Zeeman tomography method.<br> <b>Methods:</b> This\nstudy is based on rotation-phase resolved optical flux and circular\npolarization spectra of PG 1015+014 obtained with FORS1 at the ESO VLT. Our\ntomographic code makes use of an extensive database of pre-computed Zeeman\nspectra. The general approach has been described in Papers I and II of this\nseries.<br> <b>Results:</b> The surface field strength distributions for all\nrotational phases of PG 1015+014 are characterised by a strong peak at 70 MG. A\nseparate peak at 80 MG is seen for about one third of the rotation cycle.\nSignificant contributions to the Zeeman features arise from regions with field\nstrengths between 50 and 90 MG. We obtain equally good simultaneous fits to the\nobservations, collected in five phase bins, for two different field\nparametrizations: (i) a superposition of individually tilted and off-centred\nzonal multipole components; and (ii) a truncated multipole expansion up to\ndegree l = 4 including all zonal and tesseral components. The magnetic fields\ngenerated by both parametrizations exhibit a similar global structure of the\nabsolute surface field values, but differ considerably in the topology of the\nfield lines. An effective photospheric temperature of T<sub>eff</sub> = 10000\n&plusmn; 1000 K was found.<br> <b>Conclusions:</b> Remaining discrepancies\nbetween the observations and our best-fit models suggest that additional\nsmall-scale structure of the magnetic field exists which our field models are\nunable to cover due to the restricted number of free parameters.<br>\n", "  We present the revised ``Meudon'' model of Photon Dominated Region (PDR\ncode), presently available on the web under the Gnu Public Licence at:\nhttp://aristote.obspm.fr/MIS. General organisation of the code is described\ndown to a level that should allow most observers to use it as an interpretation\ntool with minimal help from our part. Two grids of models, one for low\nexcitation diffuse clouds and one for dense highly illuminated clouds, are\ndiscussed, and some new results on PDR modelisation highlighted.\n", "  The detection of Cerenkov light from EAS in a delayed coincidence with\nfluorescence light gives a strong signature to discriminate protons and\nneutrinos in cosmic rays. For this purpose, the ULTRA experiment has been\ndesigned with 2 detectors: a small EAS array (ETscope) and an UV optical device\nincluding wide field (Belenos) and narrow field (UVscope) Cerenkov light\ndetectors. The array measures the shower size and the arrival direction of the\nincoming EAS, while the UV devices, pointing both to zenith and nadir, are used\nto determine the amount of direct and diffused coincident Cerenkov light. This\ninformation, provided for different diffusing surfaces, will be used to verify\nthe possibility of detecting from Space the Cerenkov light produced by UHECRs\nwith the EUSO experiment, on board the ISS.\n", "  We report the detection of the J=2-1 line of DCO+ in the proto-planetary disk\nof DM Tau and re-analyze the spectrum covering the 465 GHz transition of HDO in\nthis source, recently published by Ceccarelli et al. (2005). A modelling of the\nDCO+ line profile with the source parameters derived from high resolution HCO+\nobservations yields a DCO+/HCO+ abundance ratio of about 0.004, an order of\nmagnitude smaller than that derived in the low mass cores. The re-analysis of\nthe 465 GHz spectrum, using the proper continuum flux (0.5 Jy) and source\nsystemic velocity (6.05 km/s), makes it clear that the absorption features\nattributed to HDO and C6H are almost certainly unrelated to these species. We\nshow that the line-to-continuum ratio of an absorption line in front of a\nKeplerian disk can hardly exceed the ratio of the turbulent velocity to the\nprojected rotation velocity at the disk edge, unless the line is optically very\nthick (tau > 10 000). This ratio is typically 0.1-0.3 in proto-planetary disks\nand is about 0.15 in DM Tau, much smaller than that for the alleged absorption\nfeatures. We also show that the detection of H2D+ in DM Tau, previously\nreported by these authors, is only a 2-sigma detection when the proper velocity\nis adopted. So far, DCO+ is thus the only deuterated molecule clearly detected\nin proto-planetary disks.\n", "  We derive the deflection angle of light rays caused by a brane black hole\nwith mass m and tidal charge q in the weak lensing approach, up to the second\norder in perturbation theory. We point out when the newly derived second order\ncontributions become important.\n", "  The understanding of acceleration mechanisms in active galactic nuclei (AGN)\njets and the measurement of the extragalactic-background-light (EBL) density\nare closely linked and require the detection of a large sample of\nvery-high-energy (VHE) emitting extragalactic objects at varying redshifts. We\nreport here on the discovery with the H.E.S.S. (High Energy Stereoscopic\nSystem) atmospheric-Cherenkov telescopes of the VHE Gamma-ray emission from\nH2356 - 309, an extreme BL Lac object located at a redshift of 0.165. The\nobservations of this object, which was previously proposed as a\nsouthern-hemisphere VHE candidate source, were performed between June and\nDecember 2004. The total exposure is 38.9 hours live time, after data quality\nselection, which yields the detection of a signal at the level of 9.0$\\sigma$\n(standard deviations) .\n", "  From May to July 2004, the central radian of the Galactic Plane was scanned\nby the H.E.S.S. (High Energy Stereoscopic System) telescopes at energies above\n200 GeV. This survey was performed from -$3^o$ to +$3^o$ in latitude, for a\ntotal of 230 hours, revealing eight new VHE sources at a significance level\ngreater than 6$\\sigma$(standard deviations). We present a multi-resolution\nanalysis of these sources based on a continuous wavelet transformation (CWT).\nUsing CO and HI data, we investigate the possible associations of the potential\ncounterparts proposed in [1], with sites of enhanced interstellar matter\ndensity.\n", "  Aim: We present early optical spectroscopy of the afterglow of the gamma-ray\nburst GRB 060206 with the aim of determining the metallicity of the GRB\nabsorber and the physical conditions in the circumburst medium. We also discuss\nhow GRBs may be important complementary probes of cosmic chemical evolution.\nMethod: Absorption line study of the GRB afterglow spectrum. Results: We\ndetermine the redshift of the GRB to be z=4.04795+/-0.00020. Based on the\nmeasurement of the neutral hydrogen column density from the damped Lyman-alpha\nline and the metal content from weak, unsaturated Sii lines we derive a\nmetallicity of [S/H] =-0.84+/-0.10. This is one of the highest metallicities\nmeasured from absorption lines at z~4. From the very high column densities for\nthe forbidden Siii*, Oi*, and Oi** lines we infer very high densities and low\ntemperatures in the system. There is evidence for the presence of H$_2$\nmolecules with logN(H_2) ~ 17.0, translating into a molecular fraction of logf\n\\~ -3.5 with f=2N(H_2)/(2N(H_2)+ N(Hi)). Even if GRBs are only formed by single\nmassive stars with metallicities below ~0.3Z(solar), they could still be fairly\nunbiased tracers of the bulk of the star formation at z>2. Hence, metallicities\nas derived for GRB060206 here for a complete sample of GRB afterglows will\ndirectly show the distribution of metallicities for representative star-forming\ngalaxies at these redshifts.\n", "  In a thermodynamical model of cosmological FLRW event horizons for the dark\nenergy (DE), we consider a logarithmic corrective term in the entropy to which\ncorresponds a new term in the DE density. This model of $\\Lambda (t)$ in an\ninteracting two-component cosmology with cold dark matter (DM) as second\ncomponent leads to a system of coupled equations, yielding, after numerical\nresolution, the evolutions of $\\Lambda (t)$, the Hubble $H(t)$, vacuum density\n$\\Omega \\_{\\Lambda}(t)$, deceleration $q(t)$ and statefinder $R(t)$ and $S(t)$\nparameters. Its results, compatible with an initial inflation and the current\nobservations of the so-called \"concordance model\", predict a graceful exit of\nearly inflation and the present acceleration and solve in the same time the age\nand coincidence problems. Moreover they account for the low-$l$ CMBR power\nspectrum suppression.\n", "  We present a monitoring study of SN 2004A and probable discovery of a\nprogenitor star in pre-explosion HST images. The photometric and spectroscopic\nmonitoring of SN 2004A show that it was a normal Type II-P which was discovered\nin NGC 6207 about two weeks after explosion. We compare SN 2004A to the similar\nType II-P SN 1999em and estimate an explosion epoch of 2004 January 6. We also\ncalculate three new distances to NGC 6207 of 21.0 +/-4.3, 21.4 +/-3.5 and 25.1\n+/-1.7Mpc. The former was calculated using the Standard Candle Method (SCM) for\nSNe II-P, and the latter two from the Brightest Supergiants Method (BSM). We\ncombine these three distances with existing kinematic distances, to derive a\nmean value of 20.3 +/-3.4Mpc. Using this distance we estimate that the ejected\nnickel mass in the explosion is 0.046(+0.031,-0.017) Msolar. The progenitor of\nSN 2004A is identified in pre-explosion WFPC2 F814W images with a magnitude of\nmF814W = 24.3 +/-0.3, but is below the detection limit of the F606W images. We\nshow that this was likely a red supergiant (RSG) with a mass of 9(+3,-2)\nMsolar. The object is detected at 4.7 sigma above the background noise. Even if\nthis detection is spurious, the 5 sigma upper limit would give a robust upper\nmass limit of 12 Msolar for a RSG progenitor. These initial masses are very\nsimilar to those of two previously identified RSG progenitors of the Type II-P\nSNe 2004gd 8(+4,-2) Msolar and 2005cs 9(+3,-2) Msolar).\n", "  We present full evolutionary calculations appropriate to post-AGB PG1159\nstars for a wide range of stellar masses.\n  We take into account the complete evolutionary stages of PG1159 progenitors\nstarting from the Zero Age Main Sequence. We consider the two kinds of Born\nAgain Scenarios, the very late thermal pulse (VLTP) and the late thermal pulse\n(LTP), that give rise to hydrogen-deficient compositions. The location of our\nPG1159 tracks in the effective temperature - gravity diagram and their\ncomparison with previous calculations as well as the resulting surface\ncompositions are discussed at some length.\n  Our results reinforce the idea that the different abundances of $^{14}$N\nobserved at the surface of those PG1159 stars with undetected hydrogen is an\nindication that the progenitors of these stars would have evolved through a\nVLTP episode, where most of the hydrogen content of the remnant is burnt, or\nLTP, where hydrogen is not burnt but instead diluted to very low surface\nabundances. We derive new values for spectroscopical masses based on these new\nmodels. We discuss the correlation between the presence of planetary nebulae\nand the $^{14}$N abundance as another indicator that $^{14}$N-rich objects\nshould come from a VLTP episode while $^{14}$N-deficient ones should be the\nresult of a LTP. Finally, we discuss an evolutionary scenario that could\nexplain the existence of PG1159 stars with unusually high helium abundances and\na possible evolutionary connection between these stars and the low mass O(He)\nstars.\n", "  A dynamical model including ram pressure stripping is applied to the strongly\nHI deficient Virgo spiral galaxy NGC 4522. A carefully chosen model snapshot is\ncompared with existing VLA HI observations. The model successfully reproduces\nthe large-scale gas distribution and the velocity field. However it fails to\nreproduce the large observed HI linewidths in the extraplanar component, for\nwhich we give possible explanations. In a second step, we solve the induction\nequation on the velocity fields of the dynamical model and calculate the large\nscale magnetic field. Assuming a Gaussian distribution of relativistic\nelectrons we obtain the distribution of polarized radio continuum emission\nwhich is also compared with our VLA observations at 6 cm. The observed maximum\nof the polarized radio continuum emission is successfully reproduced. Our model\nsuggests that the ram pressure maximum occurred only ~50 Myr ago. Since NGC\n4522 is located far away from the cluster center (~1 Mpc) where the\nintracluster medium density is too low to cause the observed stripping if the\nintracluster medium is static and smooth, two scenarios are envisaged: (i) the\ngalaxy moves very rapidly within the intracluster medium and is not even bound\nto the cluster; in this case the galaxy has just passed the region of highest\nintracluster medium density; (ii) the intracluster medium is not static but\nmoving due to the infall of the M49 group of galaxies. In this case the galaxy\nhas just passed the region of highest intracluster medium velocity. This study\nshows the strength of combining high resolution HI and polarized radio\ncontinuum emission with detailed numerical modeling of the evolution of the gas\nand the large-scale magnetic field.\n", "  We study two samples of local galaxies, one is UV (GALEX) selected and the\nother FIR (IRAS) selected, to address the question whether UV and FIR surveys\nsee the two sides ('bright' and 'dark') of the star formation of the same\npopulation of galaxies or two different populations of star forming galaxies.\nNo significant difference between the L$_{tot}$ ($=L_{60}+L_{FUV}$) luminosity\nfunctions of the UV and FIR samples is found. Also, after the correction for\nthe `Malmquist bias' (bias for flux limited samples), the FIR-to-UV ratio v.s.\nL$_{tot}$ relations of the two samples are consistent with each other. In the\nrange of $9 \\la \\log(L_{tot}/L_\\sun) \\la 12$, both can be approximated by a\nsimple linear relation of $\\log (L_{60}/L_{FUV})=\\log(L_{tot}/L_\\sun)-9.66$.\nThese are consistent with the hypothesis that the two samples represent the\nsame population of star forming galaxies, and their well documented differences\nin L$_{tot}$ and in FIR-to-UV ratio are due only to the selection effect. A\ncomparison between the UV luminosity functions shows marginal evidence for a\npopulation of faint UV galaxies missing in the FIR selected sample. The\ncontribution from these 'FIR-quiet' galaxies to the overall UV population is\ninsignificant, given that the K-band luminosity functions (i.e. the stellar\nmass functions) of the two samples do not show any significant difference.\n", "  Unbiased molecular line surveys are a powerful tool for analyzing the\nphysical and chemical parameters of astronomical objects and are the only means\nfor obtaining a complete view of the molecular inventory for a given source.\nThe present work stands for the first such investigation of a photon-dominated\nregion. The first results of an ongoing millimeter-wave survey obtained towards\nthe Orion Bar are reported. The APEX telescope in combination with the APEX-2A\nfacility receiver was employed in this investigation. We derived the physical\nparameters of the gas through LVG analyses of the methanol and formaldehyde\ndata. Information on the sulfur and deuterium chemistry of photon-dominated\nregions is obtained from detections of several sulfur-bearing molecules and\nDCN.\n", "  Nine extrasolar planets with masses between 110 and 430M are known to transit\ntheir star. The knowledge of their masses and radii allows an estimate of their\ncomposition, but uncertainties on equations of state, opacities and possible\nmissing energy sources imply that only inaccurate constraints can be derived\nwhen considering each planet separately. Aims: We seek to better understand the\ncomposition of transiting extrasolar planets by considering them as an\nensemble, and by comparing the obtained planetary properties to that of the\nparent stars. Methods: We use evolution models and constraints on the stellar\nages to derive the mass of heavy elements present in the planets. Possible\nadditional energy sources like tidal dissipation due to an inclined orbit or to\ndownward kinetic energy transport are considered. Results: We show that the\nnine transiting planets discovered so far belong to a quite homogeneous\nensemble that is characterized by a mass of heavy elements that is a relatively\nsteep function of the stellar metallicity, from less than 20 earth masses of\nheavy elements around solar composition stars, to up to 100M for three times\nthe solar metallicity (the precise values being model-dependant). The\ncorrelation is still to be ascertained however. Statistical tests imply a\nworst-case 1/3 probability of a false positive. Conclusions: Together with the\nobserved lack of giant planets in close orbits around metal-poor stars, these\nresults appear to imply that heavy elements play a key role in the formation of\nclose-in giant planets. The large masses of heavy elements inferred for planets\norbiting metal rich stars was not anticipated by planet formation models and\nshows the need for alternative theories including migration and subsequent\ncollection of planetesimals.\n", "  Context. In coded mask techniques, reconstructed sky images are\npseudo-images: they are maps of the correlation between the image recorded on a\ndetector and an array derived from the coded mask pattern. Aims. The\nINTEGRAL/IBIS telescope provides images where the flux of each detected source\nis given by the height of the local peak in the correlation map. As such, it\ncannot provide an estimate of the flux of an extended source. What is needed is\nintensity sky images giving the flux per solide angle as typically done at\nother wavelengths. Methods. In this paper, we present the response of the\nINTEGRAL IBIS/ISGRI coded mask instrument to extended sources. We develop a\ngeneral method based on analytical calculations in order to measure the\nintensity and the associated error of any celestial source and validated with\nMonte-Carlo simulations. Results. We find that the sensitivity degrades almost\nlinearly with the source extent. Analytical formulae are given as well as an\neasy-to-use recipe for the INTEGRAL user. We check this method on IBIS/ISGRI\ndata but these results are general and applicable to any coded mask telescope.\n", "  Aims. We report the INTEGRAL/IBIS observations of the Coma Cluster in the\nhard X-ray/soft-ray domain. Methods. Since the Coma Cluster appears as an\nextended source, its global intensity and significance cannot be directly\nextracted with standard coded mask analysis. We used the method of imaging the\nextended sources with a coded mask telescope developed by Renaud et al. (2006).\nResults. The imaging capabilities and the sensitivity of the IBIS/ISGRI coded\nmask instrument allows us to identify for the first time the site of the\nemission above ~ 15 keV. We have studied the Coma Cluster morphology in the\n18-30keV band and found that it follows the prediction based on X-ray\nobservations.We also bring constraints on the non-thermal mechanism\ncontribution at higher energies.\n", "  Finding tracers of the innermost regions of prestellar cores is important for\nunderstanding their chemical and dynamical evolution before the onset of\ngravitational collapse. While classical molecular tracers, such as CO and CS,\nhave been shown to be strongly depleted in cold, dense gas by condensation on\ngrain mantles, it has been a subject of discussion to what extent\nnitrogen-bearing species, such as ammonia, are affected by this process. As\ndeuterium fractionation is efficient in cold, dense gas, deuterated species are\nexcellent tracers of prestellar cores. A comparison of the spatial distribution\nof neutral and ionized deuterated species with the dust continuum emission can\nthus provide important insights into the physical and chemical structure of\nsuch regions. We study the spatial distribution of the ground-state 335.5 GHz\nline of ND2H in LDN1689N, using APEX, and compare it with the distribution of\nthe DCO+(3--2) line, as well as the 350 micron dust continuum emission observed\nwith the SHARC~II bolometer camera at CSO. While the distribution of the ND2H\nemission in LDN1689N is generally similar to that of the 350 microns dust\ncontinuum emission, the peak of the ND2H emission is offset by ~10'' to the\nEast from the dust continuum and DCO+ emission peak. ND2H and ND3 share the\nsame spatial distribution. The observed offset between the ND2H and DCO+\nemission is consistent with the hypothesis that the deuterium peak in LDN1689N\nis an interaction region between the outflow shock from IRAS16293--2422 and the\ndense ambient gas. We detect the J = 4 - 3 line of H13CO+ at 346.998 GHz in the\nimage side band serendipitously. This line shows the same spatial distribution\nas DCO+(3--2), and peaks close to the 350 mic emission maximum which provides\nfurther support for the shock interaction scenario.\n", "  A two-component fluid representing dark energy is studied. One of the\ncomponents has a polytropic form, while the other has a barotropic form. Exact\nsolutions are obtained and the cosmological parameters are constrained using\nsupernova type Ia data. In general, an open universe is predicted. A big rip\nscenario is largely preferred, but the dispersion in the parameter space is\nvery high. Hence, even if scenarios without future singularities can not be\nexcluded with the allowed range of parameters, a phantom cosmology, with an\nopen spatial section, is a general prediction of the model. For a wide range of\nthe equation of state parameters there is an asymptotic de Sitter phase.\n", "  Aims: Based on our well-determined sample of open clusters in the all-sky\ncatalogue ASCC-2.5 we derive new linear sizes of some 600 clusters, and\ninvestigate the effect of mass segregation of stars in open clusters. Methods:\nUsing statistical methods, we study the distribution of linear sizes as a\nfunction of spatial position and cluster age. We also examine statistically the\ndistribution of stars of different masses within clusters as a function of the\ncluster age. Results: No significant dependence of the cluster size on location\nin the Galaxy is detected for younger clusters (< 200 Myr), whereas older\nclusters inside the solar orbit turned out to be, on average, smaller than\noutside. Also, small old clusters are preferentially found close to the\nGalactic plane, whereas larger ones more frequently live farther away from the\nplane and at larger Galactocentric distances. For clusters with (V - M_V) <\n10.5, a clear dependence of the apparent radius on age has been detected: the\ncluster radii decrease by a factor of about 2 from an age of 10 Myr to an age\nof 1 Gyr. A detailed analysis shows that this observed effect can be explained\nby mass segregation and does not necessarily reflect a real decrease of cluster\nradii. We found evidence for the latter for the majority of clusters older than\n30 Myr. Among the youngest clusters (between 5 and 30 Myr), there are some\nclusters with a significant grade of mass segregation, whereas some others show\nno segregation at all. At a cluster age between 50 and 100 Myrs, the\ndistribution of stars of different masses becomes more regular over cluster\narea. In older clusters the evolution of the massive stars is the most\nprominent effect we observe.\n", "  We present the results of a near-infrared monitoring programme of a selected\nsample of stars, initially suspected to be Mira variables and OH/IR stars,\ncovering more than a decade of observations. The objects monitored cover the\ntypical range of IRAS colours shown by O-rich stars on the Asymptotic Giant\nBranch and show a surprisingly large diversity of variability properties. 16\nobjects are confirmed as large-amplitude variables. Periods between 360 and\n1800 days and typical amplitudes from 1 to 2 magnitudes could be determined for\nnine of them. In three light curves we find a systematic decrease of the mean\nbrightness, two light curves show pronounced asymmetry. One source, IRAS\n07222-2005, shows infrared colours typical of Mira variables but pulsates with\na much longer period (approx. 1200 days) than a normal Mira. Two objects are\nither close to (IRAS 03293+6010) or probably in (IRAS 18299-1705) the post-AGB\nphase. In IRAS 16029-3041 we found a systematic increase of the H-K colour of\napproximately 1 magnitude, which we interpret as evidence of a recent episode\nof enhanced mass loss. IRAS 18576+0341, a heavily obscured Luminous Blue\nVariable was also monitored. The star showed a continued decrease of brightness\nover a period of 7 years (1995 - 2002).\n", "  Context. The knowledge of the point-spread function compensated by adaptive\noptics is of prime importance in several image restoration techniques such as\ndeconvolution and astrometric/photometric algorithms. Wavefront-related data\nfrom the adaptive optics real-time computer can be used to accurately estimate\nthe point-spread function in adaptive optics observations. The only\npoint-spread function reconstruction algorithm implemented on astronomical\nadaptive optics system makes use of particular functions, named $U\\_{ij}$.\nThese $U\\_{ij}$ functions are derived from the mirror modes, and their number\nis proportional to the square number of these mirror modes. Aims. We present\nhere two new algorithms for point-spread function reconstruction that aim at\nsuppressing the use of these $U\\_{ij}$ functions to avoid the storage of a\nlarge amount of data and to shorten the computation time of this PSF\nreconstruction. Methods. Both algorithms take advantage of the eigen\ndecomposition of the residual parallel phase covariance matrix. In the first\nalgorithm, the use of a basis in which the latter matrix is diagonal reduces\nthe number of $U\\_{ij}$ functions to the number of mirror modes. In the second\nalgorithm, this eigen decomposition is used to compute phase screens that\nfollow the same statistics as the residual parallel phase covariance matrix,\nand thus suppress the need for these $U\\_{ij}$ functions. Results. Our\nalgorithms dramatically reduce the number of $U\\_{ij}$ functions to be computed\nfor the point-spread function reconstruction. Adaptive optics simulations show\nthe good accuracy of both algorithms to reconstruct the point-spread function.\n", "  We present high spatial resolution observations of the dusty core of the\nPlanetary Nebula with Wolf-Rayet central star CPD-568032. These observations\nwere taken with the mid-infrared interferometer VLTI/MIDI in imaging mode\nproviding a typical 300 mas resolution and in interferometric mode using\nUT2-UT3 47m baseline providing a typical spatial resolution of 20 mas. The\nvisible HST images exhibit a complex multilobal geometry dominated by faint\nlobes. The farthest structures are located at 7\" from the star. The mid-IR\nenvironment of CPD-568032 is dominated by a compact source, barely resolved by\na single UT telescope in a 8.7 micron filter. The infrared core is almost fully\nresolved with the three 40-45m projected baselines ranging from -5 to 51 degree\nbut smooth oscillating fringes at low level have been detected in spectrally\ndispersed visibilities. This clear signal is interpreted in terms of a ring\nstructure which would define the bright inner rim of the equatorial disk.\nGeometric models allowed us to derive the main geometrical parameters of the\ndisk. For instance, a reasonably good fit is reached with an achromatic and\nelliptical truncated Gaussian with a radius of 97+/-11 AU, an inclination of\n28+/-7 degree and a PA for the major axis at 345+/-7 degree. Furthermore, we\nperformed some radiative transfer modeling aimed at further constraining the\ngeometry and mass content of the disk, by taking into account the MIDI\ndispersed visibilities, spectra, and the large aperture SED of the source.\nThese models show that the disk is mostly optically thin in the N band and\nhighly flared.\n", "  In long baseline interferometry, the raw fringe contrast must be calibrated\nto obtain the true visibility and then those observables that can be\ninterpreted in terms of astrophysical parameters. The selection of suitable\ncalibration stars is crucial for obtaining the ultimate precision of\ninterferometric instruments like the VLTI. We have developed software SearchCal\nthat builds an evolutive catalog of stars suitable as calibrators within any\ngiven user-defined angular distance and magnitude around the scientific target.\nWe present the first version of SearchCal dedicated to the bright-object case\nV<=10; K<=5). Star catalogs available at the CDS are consulted via web\nrequests. They provide all the useful information for selecting of calibrators.\nMissing photometries are computed with an accuracy of 0.1 mag and the missing\nangular diameters are calculated with a precision better than 10%. For each\nstar the squared visibility is computed by taking the wavelength and the\nmaximum baseline of the foreseen observation into account.} SearchCal is\nintegrated into ASPRO, the interferometric observing preparation software\ndeveloped by the JMMC, available at the address: http://mariotti.fr.\n", "  Adaptive optics (AO) allows one to derive the point spread function (PSF)\nsimultaneously to the science image, which is a major advantage in\npost-processing tasks such as astrometry/photometry or deconvolution. Based on\nthe algorithm of \\citet{veran97}, PSF reconstruction has been developed for\nfour different AO systems so far: PUEO, ALFA, Lick-AO and Altair. A similar\neffort is undertaken for NAOS/VLT in a collaboration between the group PHASE\n(Onera and Observatoire de Paris/LESIA) and ESO. In this paper, we first\nintroduce two new algorithms that prevent the use of the so-called \"$U\\_{ij}$\nfunctions\" to: (1) avoid the storage of a large amount of data (for both new\nalgorithms), (2) shorten the PSF reconstruction computation time (for one of\nthe two) and (3) provide an estimation of the PSF variability (for the other\none). We then identify and explain issues in the exploitation of real-time\nShack-Hartmann (SH) data for PSF reconstruction, emphasising the large impact\nof thresholding in the accuracy of the phase residual estimation. Finally, we\npresent the data provided by the NAOS real-time computer (RTC) to reconstruct\nPSF ({\\em (1)} the data presently available, {\\em (2)} two NAOS software\nmodifications that would provide new data to increase the accuracy of the PSF\nreconstruction and {\\em (3)} the tests of these modifications) and the PSF\nreconstruction algorithms we are developing for NAOS on that basis.\n", "  VLTi Spectro-Imager (VSI) is a proposition for a second generation VLTI\ninstrument which is aimed at providing the ESO community with the capability of\nperforming image synthesis at milli-arcsecond angular resolution. VSI provides\nthe VLTI with an instrument able to combine 4 telescopes in a baseline version\nand optionally up to 6 telescopes in the near-infrared spectral domain with\nmoderate to high spectral resolution. The instrument contains its own fringe\ntracker in order to relax the constraints onto the VLTI infrastructure. VSI\nwill do imaging at the milli-arcsecond scale with spectral resolution of: a)\nthe close environments of young stars probing the initial conditions for planet\nformation; b) the surfaces of stars; c) the environment of evolved stars,\nstellar remnants and stellar winds, and d) the central region of active\ngalactic nuclei and supermassive black holes. The science cases allowed us to\nspecify the astrophysical requirements of the instrument and to define the\nnecessary studies of the science group for phase A.\n", "  We report deep K-band (18-27GHz) observations with the 100-m Green Bank\nTelescope of HCN(1-0) line emission towards the two submillimeter-selected\ngalaxies (SMGs) SMMJ02399-0136 (z=2.81) and SMMJ16359+6612 (z=2.52). For both\nsources we have obtained spectra with channel-to-channel rms noise of <=0.5mJy,\nresulting in velocity-integrated line fluxes better than < 0.1 Jy km/s,\nalthough we do not detect either source. Such sensitive observations -- aided\nby gravitational lensing of the sources -- permit us to put upper limits of\nL_HCN(1-0) < 2x10^10 K km/s pc^2 on the intrinsic HCN(1-0) line luminosities of\nthe two SMGs. The far-infrared (FIR) luminosities for all three SMGs with\nsensitive HCN(1-0) observations to date are found to be consistent with the\ntight FIR-HCN luminosity correlation observed in Galactic molecular clouds,\nquiescent spirals and (ultra) luminous infrared galaxies in the local Universe.\nThus, the observed HCN luminosities remain in accordance with what is expected\nfrom the universal star formation efficiency per dense molecular gas mass\nimplied by the aforementioned correlation, and more sensitive observations with\ntoday's large aperture radio telescopes hold the promise of detecting HCN(1-0)\nemission in similar objects in the distant Universe.\n", "  The main objective of the present work is to ckeck if the star formation\nefficiency plays a relevant role in the evolution of the relative abundance\nN/O. We analyze the evolution of the nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio as predicted by a\nset of computed theoretical models of simulated galaxies with different total\nmasses which are evolved assuming different collapse time scales and different\nstar formation efficiencies, thus producing different star formation histories.\nThe stellar yield set we use for all of them (Gavil\\'{a}n et al. 2005) have an\nimportant contribution of primary nitrogen proceeding from low and intermediate\nmass stars. It allows to obtain a dispersion of results in the N/O-O/H plane,\nwhen star formation efficiencies vary, in general agreement with observations.\nThe model results for the N/O abundance ratio are in good agreement with most\nobservational data trends: the extragalactic H{\\sc ii} regions is well\nreproduced with present time resulting abundances and the low N/O values\nestimated for high-redshift objects, as well as the higher and constant values\nof N/O observed for irregular and dwarf galaxies or halo stars, can be\nsimultaneously obtained with our models at the same low oxygen abundances. We\nconclude that differences in the star formation history of galaxies and regions\nwithin them are a key factor to explain the data in the N/O-O/H plane.\n", "  HH30 is a well-known Pre-Main-Sequence star in Taurus. HST observations have\nrevealed a flared, edge-on disk driving a highly-collimated optical jet, making\nthis object a case study for the disk-jet-outflow paradigm. We obtained high\nangular resolution (about 1\") observations of the dust continuum at 2.7 and 1.3\nmm, and of the 12CO(2-1), 13CO(2-1) & (1-0), C18O(1-0) emissions around HH30. A\nstandard disk model is used to fit the 13CO(2-1) uv-plane visibilities and\nderive the disk properties, and the stellar mass. It results that HH30 is a low\nmass TTauri of spectral type around M1 and age 1 to 4 Myrs, surrounded by a\nmedium size Keplerian disk, of mass around 4e-3 Msun and outer radius 420 AU.\nThe disk rotation vector points toward the North-Eastern jet. Using a distance\nof 140 pc, we deduce a stellar mass of 0.45 Msun. A highly asymmetric outflow\noriginates from the inner parts of the disk. It presents to first order a\nconical morphology with a 30 degree half opening angle and a constant (12 km/s)\nradial velocity field. Outflow rotation was searched for but not found. These\nobservations do not enable to assign the origin of the molecular outflow to\nentrainment by the optical jet or to a disk wind. In the latter case, the upper\nlimit of the outflow rotation velocity implies an origin in the inner 15 AU of\nthe disk.\n", "  We report the detection of nebular emission lines in the optical and\nmid-infrared spectra of IRAS 17347-3139, a heavily obscured OH/IR star which\nmay be rapidly evolving from the AGB to the PN stage. The presence of emission\nlines is interpreted as a clear indication that the ionization of its\ncircumstellar envelope has already started. This source belongs to the rare\nclass of objects known as `OHPNe' displaying both OH maser and radio continuum\nemission. However, unlike the rest of stars in this class, prominent C-rich\ndust features are detected in its mid-infrared spectrum, which makes the\nanalysis of this star particularly interesting.\n", "  Context: Alpha Centauri is our closest stellar neighbor, at a distance of\nonly 1.3 pc, and its two main components have spectral types comparable to the\nSun. This is therefore a favorable target for an imaging search for extrasolar\nplanets. Moreover, indications exist that the gravitational mass of Alpha Cen B\nis higher than its modeled mass, the difference being consistent with a\nsubstellar companion of a few tens of Jupiter masses. Aims: We searched for\nfaint comoving companions to Alpha Cen B. As a secondary objective, we built a\ncatalogue of the detected background sources. Methods: We used the NACO\nadaptive optics system of the VLT in the J, H, and Ks bands to search for\ncompanions to Alpha Cen B. This instrument allowed us to achieve a very high\nsensitivity to point-like sources, with a limiting magnitude of m\\_Ks ~ 18 at\n7\" from the star. We complemented this data set with archival coronagraphic\nimages from the HST-ACS instrument to obtain an accurate astrometric\ncalibration. Results: Over the observed area, we did not detect any comoving\ncompanion to Alpha Cen B down to an absolute magnitude of 19-20 in the H and Ks\nbands. However, we present a catalogue of 252 background objects within about\n15\" of the star. This catalogue fills part of the large void area that\nsurrounds Alpha Cen in sky surveys due to the strong diffused light. We also\npresent a model of the diffused light as a function of angular distance for the\nNACO instrument, that can be used to predict the background level for bright\nstar observations. Conclusions: According to recent numerical models, the\nlimiting magnitude of our search sets the maximum mass of possible companions\nto 20-30 times Jupiter, between 7 and 20 AU from Alpha Cen B.\n", "  Aim: To determine whether or not gas-phase chemical models with homogeneous\nand time-independent physical conditions explain the many observed molecular\nabundances in astrophysical sources, it is crucial to estimate the\nuncertainties in the calculated abundances and compare them with the observed\nabundances and their uncertainties. Non linear amplification of the error and\nbifurcation may limit the applicability of chemical models. Here we study such\neffects on dense cloud chemistry. Method: Using a previously studied approach\nto uncertainties based on the representation of rate coefficient errors as log\nnormal distributions, we attempted to apply our approach using as input a\nvariety of different elemental abundances from those studied previously. In\nthis approach, all rate coefficients are varied randomly within their log\nnormal (Gaussian) distribution, and the time-dependent chemistry calculated\nanew many times so as to obtain good statistics for the uncertainties in the\ncalculated abundances. Results: Starting with so-called ``high-metal''\nelemental abundances, we found bimodal rather than Gaussian like distributions\nfor the abundances of many species and traced these strange distributions to an\nextreme sensitivity of the system to changes in the ratio of the cosmic ray\nionization rate zeta\\_He for He and that for molecular hydrogen zeta\\_H2. The\nsensitivity can be so extreme as to cause a region of bistability, which was\nsubsequently found to be more extensive for another choice of elemental\nabundances. To the best of our knowledge, the bistable solutions found in this\nway are the same as found previously by other authors, but it is best to think\nof the ratio zeta\\_He/zeta\\_H2 as a control parameter perpendicular to the\n''standard'' control parameter zeta/n\\_H.\n", "  In this paper we present the results of the analysis of the INTEGRAL data for\nthe black hole transient GRO J1655-40. The observations consist of four ToO\n(100 ks each) observations's AO-3 spread from February to April of 2005. We\npresent here the preliminary spectral analysis of this source between 5 and 200\nkeV. Also, some comments of the light curves obtained during this period are\nshown.\n", "  The variational method with constraints recently developed by Verkley and\nGerkema to describe maximum-entropy atmospheric profiles is generalized to\nideal gases but with temperature-dependent specific heats. In so doing, an\nextended and non standard potential temperature is introduced that is well\nsuited for tackling the problem under consideration. This new formalism is\nsuccessfully applied to the atmosphere of Venus. Three well defined regions\nemerge in this atmosphere up to a height of $100 km$ from the surface: the\nlowest one up to about $35 km$ is adiabatic, a transition layer located at the\nheight of the cloud deck and finally a third region which is practically\nisothermal.\n", "  We search for effects of metallicity on B and Be stars in the Small and Large\nMagellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC) and in the Milky Way (MW). We extend our\nprevious analysis of B and Be stars populations in the LMC to the SMC. The\nrotational velocities of massive stars and the evolutionary status of Be stars\nare examined with respect to their environments. Spectroscopic observations of\nhot stars belonging to the young cluster SMC-NGC 330 and its surrounding region\nhave been obtained with the VLT-GIRAFFE facilities in MEDUSA mode. We determine\nfundamental parameters for B and Be stars with the GIRFIT code, taking into\naccount the effect of fast rotation, and the age of observed clusters. We\ncompare the mean vsini obtained by spectral type- and mass-selection for field\nand cluster B and Be stars in the SMC with the one in the LMC and MW. We find\nthat (i) B and Be stars rotate faster in the SMC than in the LMC, and in the\nLMC than in the MW; (ii) at a given metallicity, Be stars begin their main\nsequence life with a higher initial rotational velocity than B stars.\nConsequently, only a fraction of B stars that reach the ZAMS with a\nsufficiently high initial rotational velocity can become Be stars; (iii) the\ndistributions of initial rotational velocities at the ZAMS for Be stars in the\nSMC, LMC and MW are mass- and metallicity-dependent; (iv) the angular\nvelocities of B and Be stars are higher in the SMC than in the LMC and MW; (v)\nin the SMC and LMC, massive Be stars appear in the second part of the main\nsequence, contrary to massive Be stars in the MW.\n", "  We present a new speckle camera designed and built at Observatoire\nMidi-Pyr\\'{e}n\\'{e}es. This focal instrument has been used for four years with\nthe 2-meter Bernard Lyot Telescope of Pic du Midi observatory. It can be set in\nvarious operating modes: full pupil imaging, masked-pupil imaging,\nspectroscopy, wave-front sensor and stellar coronagraphy, hence its name\n\"PISCO\" (\"Pupil Interferometry Speckle COronagraph\"). Restored images of double\nand triple stars have demonstrated its capabilities in providing close to\ndiffraction limited images (0.06 arcsec in V). PISCO has been fully tested and\nis now ready to be used by the whole astronomical community.\n", "  Ultra Luminous Infra-Red Galaxies (ULIRGs) -- gas-rich mergers harboring the\nmost extreme star-forming conditions encountered in the local Universe -- are\nthought to re-enact the galaxy formation processes we are only barely able to\nglimpse in the distant Universe. Combining new single-dish molecular line\nobservations of 12CO, 13CO, HCO+, HCN, and CS towards the two ULIRGs Arp220 and\nNGC6240 with existing data in the literature, we have compiled the most\nextensive molecular line data-sets to date of such galaxies. The data allow us\nto put strong constraints on the properties of the dense star forming gas in\nthese two systems, and compare the relative usefulness of CS, HCN and HCO+ as\ntracers of dense gas. In addition, we have build molecular line templates based\non our observations, and demonstrate that Herschel/HI-FI will be able to detect\nthe high-J transitions of most of the above molecules in a large sample of\nULIRGs out to z<=0.5, assuming Arp220 and NGC6240 are representative of the\nULIRG population at these redshifts.\n", "  We performed sub-arcsecond high-sensitivity nterferometric observations of\nthe thermal dust emission at 1.4 mm and 2.8 mm in the disks surrounding LkCa 15\nand MWC 480, with the new 750 m baselines of the IRAM PdBI array. This provides\na linear resolution of about 60 AU at the Taurus distance. We report the\nexistence of a cavity of about 50 AU radius in the inner disk of LkCa 15.\nWhereas LkCa 15 emission is optically thin, the optically thick core of MWC 480\nis resolved at 1.4 mm with a radius of about 35 AU, constraining the dust\ntemperature. In MWC 480, the dust emission is coming from a colder layer than\nthe CO emission, most likely the disk mid-plane. These observations provide\ndirect evidence of an inner cavity around LkCa 15. Such a cavity most probably\nresults from the tidal disturbance created by a low mass companion or large\nplanet at about 30 AU from the star. These results suggest that planetary\nsystem formation is already at work in LkCa 15. They also indicate that the\nclassical steady-state viscous disk model is a too simplistic description of\nthe inner 50 AU of ''proto-planetary'' disks, and that the disk evolution is\ncoupled to the planet formation process. The MWC 480 results indicate that a\nproper estimate of the dust temperature and size of the optically thick core\nare essential to determine the dust emissivity index.\n", "  We investigate the cosmological Fisher information in the non-linear\ndark-matter power spectrum in the context of the halo model. We find that there\nis a plateau in information content on translinear scales which is generic to\nall cosmological parameters we tried. There is a rise in information on smaller\nscales, but we find that it is quite degenerate among different cosmological\nparameters (except, perhaps, the tilt). This suggests that it could be\ndifficult to constrain cosmological parameters using the non-linear regime of\nthe dark-matter power spectrum. We suggest ways to get around this problem,\nsuch as removing the largest haloes from consideration in survey analysis.\n", "  We present here a complete list of contributions to the gravitational wave\nfrequency evolution from compact binaries on circular orbits up to the second\npost-Newtonian order by including the interaction of magnetic dipole moments,\nquadrupole-monopole interactions together with the spin-orbit, the spin-spin\nand the self-interaction spin contributions. We apply our results to the\nManchester et al. model of the J0737-3039A-B double pulsar.\n", "  We present our chemically consistent GALEV Evolutionary Synthesis models for\ngalaxies and point out differences to previous generations of models and their\neffects on the interpretation of local and high-redshift galaxy data.\n", "  We present IRAC (3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 micron) observations of the\nChamaeleon II molecular cloud. The observed area covers about 1 square degree\ndefined by $A_V >2$. Analysis of the data in the 2005 c2d catalogs reveals a\nsmall number of sources (40) with properties similar to those of young\nstellaror substellar objects (YSOs). The surface density of these YSO\ncandidates is low, and contamination by background galaxies appears to be\nsubstantial, especially for sources classified as Class I or flat SED. We\ndiscuss this problem in some detail and conclude that very few of the candidate\nYSOs in early evolutionary stages are actually in the Cha II cloud. Using a\nrefined set of criteria, we define a smaller, but more reliable, set of 24 YSO\ncandidates.\n", "  We present mid-infrared spectra of 5 submillimeter galaxies at z=0.65-2.38\ntaken with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Four of these sources, at z<1.5, have\nstrong PAH features and their composite spectrum is well fitted by an M82-like\nspectrum with an additional power-law component consistent with that expected\nfrom AGN activity. Based on a comparison of the 7.7-micron PAH equivalent width\nand the PAH-to-infrared luminosity ratio of these galaxies with local\ntemplates, we conclude that these galaxies host both star-formation and AGN\nactivity, with star-formation dominating the bolometric luminosity. The source\nat z=2.38 displays a Mrk231-type broad feature at restframe ~8 micron that does\nnot conform to the typical 7.7/8.6 micron PAH complex in starburst galaxies,\nsuggesting a more substantial AGN contribution.\n", "  We performed a near-IR/optical monitoring programme from 1999 to 2005 in\norder to study the variability properties of the 'Arecibo sample of OH/IR\nstars' (periods, amplitudes, and colour variations). Here we describe this\nmulti-wavelength long-term monitoring programme. Data analysis is still in\nprocess. Our ultimate goal is to study in particular the oxygen-rich AGB stars\nwith masses larger than 2 Solar Mass, which are probably rare among AGB stars\ndiscovered optically and/or in the near-IR, but are common in samples\ndiscovered in the mid- to far-IR.\n", "  A neural network mechanism that can compensate for poor optical quality was\nrecently discovered in a biological context. We propose that this mechanism can\nand should be adopted for astronomical purposes. This would shift emphasis away\nfrom the quality of the optical equipment to information processing, hence\nshould decrease the cost and make larger instruments feasible.\n", "  We report on the detection of two Halpha-emitting extreme compact objects\nfrom deep images of the Abell 634 and Abell 539 clusters of galaxies at z ~\n0.03. Follow up long slit spectroscopy of these two unresolved sources revealed\nthat they are members of their respective clusters showing HII type spectra.\nThe luminosity and the extreme equivalent width of Halpha+[NII] measured for\nthese sources, together with their very compact appearance, has raised the\nquestion about the origin of these intense starbursts in the cluster\nenvironment. We propose the compact starburst in Abell 539 resulted from the\ncompression of the interstellar gas of a dwarf galaxy when entering the cluster\ncore; while the starburst galaxy in Abell 634 is likely to be the result of a\ngalaxy-galaxy interaction, illustrating the preprocessing of galaxies during\ntheir infall towards the central regions of clusters. The contribution of these\ncompact star-forming dwarf galaxies to the star formation history of galaxy\nclusters is discussed, as well as a possible link with the recently discovered\nearly-type ultra-compact dwarf galaxies. We note that these extreme objects\nwill be rarely detected in normal magnitude-limited optical or NIR surveys,\nmainly due to their low stellar masses (of the order of 10^6 solar masses),\nwhereas they will easily show up in dedicated Halpha surveys given the high\nequivalent width of their emission lines.\n", "  We describe a new method for robustly testing theoretical predictions of red\ngiant evolution near the tip of the giant branch. When theoretical cumulative\nluminosity functions are shifted to align the tip in I-band and normalized at a\nluminosity level slightly brighter than the red giant bump, virtually all\ndependence on age and composition (heavy elements and helium abundance) is\neliminated. While significant comparisons with observations require large\nsamples of giant stars, such samples are available for some of the most massive\nMilky Way globular clusters. We present comparisons with the clusters NGC 2808\nand M5, and find that NGC 2808 has a deficiency of bright giants (with a\nprobability of less than about 3% that a more extreme distribution of giant\nstars would have happened by chance). We discuss the possibilities that\nunderestimated neutrino losses or strong mass loss could be responsible for the\ndeficit of giants. While we cannot rule out the neutrino hypothesis, it cannot\nexplain the apparent agreement between the M5 observations and models. On the\nother hand, strong mass loss provides a potential link between the giant star\nobservations and NGC 2808's unusually blue horizontal branch. If the mass loss\nhypothesis is true, there is likely a significant population of He white dwarfs\nthat could be uncovered with slightly deeper UV observations of the cluster.\n", "  The COMPTEL unidentified source GRO J 1411-64 was observed by INTEGRAL and\nXMM-Newton in 2005. The Circinus Galaxy is the only source detected within the\n4$\\sigma$ location error of GRO J1411-64, but in here excluded as the possible\ncounterpart. At soft X-rays, 22 reliable and statistically significant sources\n(likelihood $> 10$) were extracted and analyzed from XMM-Newton data. Only one\nof these sources, XMMU J141255.6 -635932, is spectrally compatible with GRO\nJ1411-64 although the fact the soft X-ray observations do not cover the full\nextent of the COMPTEL source position uncertainty make an association hard to\nquantify and thus risky. At the best location of the source, detections at hard\nX-rays show only upper limits, which, together with MeV results obtained by\n  COMPTEL suggest the existence of a peak in power output located somewhere\nbetween 300-700 keV for the so-called low state. Such a spectrum resembles\nthose in blazars or microquasars, and might suggest at work by a similar\nscenario.\n  However, an analysis using a microquasar model consisting on a magnetized\nconical jet filled with relativistic electrons, shows that it is hard to comply\nwith all observational constrains. This fact and the non-detection at hard\nX-rays introduce an a-posteriori question mark upon the physical reality of\nthis source, what is discussed here.\n", "  The robotic ROTSE-III telescope network detected prompt optical emission\ncontemporaneous with the gamma-ray emission of Swift events GRB051109A and\nGRB051111. Both datasets have continuous coverage at high signal-to-noise\nlevels from the prompt phase onwards, thus the early observations are readily\ncompared to the Swift XRT and BAT high energy detections. In both cases, the\noptical afterglow is established, declining steadily during the prompt\nemission. For GRB051111, there is evidence of an excess optical component\nduring the prompt emission. The component is consistent with the flux\nspectrally extrapolated from the gamma-rays, using the gamma-ray spectral\nindex. A compilation of spectral information from previous prompt detections\nshows that such a component is unusual. The existence of two prompt optical\ncomponents - one connected to the high-energy emission, the other to separate\nafterglow flux, as indicated in GRB051111 - is not compatible with a simple\n``external-external'' shock model for the GRB and its afterglow.\n", "  If the concordance $\\Lambda$CDM model is a true description of the universe,\nit should also properly predict the properties and structure of dark matter\nhaloes, where galaxies are born. Using N-body simulations with a broad scale of\nmass and spatial resolution, we study the structure of dark matter haloes, the\ndistribution of masses and the spatial distribution of subhaloes within the\nmain haloes.\n  We carry out three $\\Lambda$CDM simulations with different resolutions using\nthe AMIGA code. Dark matter haloes are identified using an algorithm that is\nbased on the adaptive grid structure of the simulation code. The haloes we find\nencompass the mass scales from $10^8\\mathrm{M}_{\\sun}$ to\n$10^{15}\\mathrm{M}_{\\sun}$.\n  We find that if we have to study the halo structure (search for subhaloes),\nthe haloes have to contain at least $10^4$ particles. For such haloes, where we\ncan resolve substructure, we determined the subhalo mass function and found\nthat it is close to a power law with the slope -0.9 (at present time),\nconsistent with previous studies. This slope depends slightly on the redshift\nand it is approximately the same for main haloes.\n  The subhalo mass fraction ($M_{\\s subH}/M_{\\s MH}$) is between 0.08 and 0.2,\nincreasing slightly with redshift and with the mass of the main halo. Its\ndistribution is approximated using the Weibull distribution at different\nepochs. The mean values of subhalo mass are independent of the main halo mass.\nThe spatial density of subhaloes, scaled to the virial radius of the main halo\n($r_{\\s vir}$), is independent of redshift and follows the $r^{1/3}$ rule.\n", "  Context: The nearby pair of solar-type stars Alpha Centauri is a favorable\ntarget for an imaging search for extrasolar planets. Indications exist that the\ngravitational mass of Alpha Cen B could be higher than its modeled mass, the\ndifference being consistent with a substellar companion of a few tens of\nJupiter masses. However, Alpha Centauri usually appears in star catalogues\nsurrounded by a large void area, due to the strong diffused light. Aims: We\nsearched for faint comoving companions to Alpha Cen located at angular\ndistances of the order of a few tens of arcseconds, up to 2-3 arcmin. As a\nsecondary objective, we built a catalogue of the detected background sources.\nMethods: In order to complement our adaptive optics search at small angular\ndistances (Paper I), we used atmosphere limited CCD imaging from the NTT-SUSI2\ninstrument in the Bessel V, R, I, and Z bands. Results: We present the results\nof our search in the form of a catalogue of the detected objects inside a 5.5\narcmin box around this star. A total of 4313 sources down to mV~24 and mI~22\nwere detected from this wide-field survey. We extracted the infrared photometry\nof part of the detected sources from archive images of the 2MASS survey (JHK\nbands). We investigate briefly the nature of the detected sources, many of them\npresenting extremely red color indices (V-K > 14). Conclusions: We did not\ndetect any companion to Alpha Centauri between 100 and 300 AU, down to a\nmaximum mass of ~15 times Jupiter. We also mostly exclude the presence of a\ncompanion more massive than 30 MJup between 50 and 100 AU.\n", "  Using data from the Spitzer Space Telescope Legacy Science Program\n``Formation and Evolution of Planetary Systems'' (FEPS), we have searched for\ndebris disks around 9 FGK stars (2-10 Gyr), known from radial velocity (RV)\nstudies to have one or more massive planets. Only one of the sources, HD 38529,\nhas excess emission above the stellar photosphere; at 70 micron the\nsignal-to-noise ratio in the excess is 4.7 while at wavelengths < 30 micron\nthere is no evidence of excess. The remaining sources show no excesses at any\nSpitzer wavelengths. Applying survival tests to the FEPS sample and the results\nfor the FGK survey published in Bryden et al. (2006), we do not find a\nsignificant correlation between the frequency and properties of debris disks\nand the presence of close-in planets. We discuss possible reasons for the lack\nof a correlation.\n", "  To prepare for the unprecedented spatial and spectral resolution provided by\nALMA and Herschel/HIFI, chemical models are being benchmarked against each\nother. It is obvious that chemical models also need well-constrained\nobservations that can serve as references. Photo-dissociation regions (PDRs)\nare particularly well suited to serve as references because they make the link\nbetween diffuse and molecular clouds, thus enabling astronomers to probe a\nlarge variety of physical and chemical processes. At a distance of 400 pc (1\"\ncorresponding to 0.002 pc), the Horsehead PDR is very close to the prototypical\nkind of source (i.e. 1D, edge-on) needed to serve as a reference to models.\n", "  We present visible and near-infrared images of the amorphous dwarf galaxy NGC\n1705 in the $B$, $V$, $R$, $J$, $H$, and $K$ bands. Optical and near infrared\ncolors in the galaxy are consistent with a composite population with colors\nsimilar to those of the bluest Sc nuclei. The contribution of young stars to\nthe disk population of the galaxy decreases outwards from the center. In the\nnear infrared images we detect three unresolved point sources, two of which\nhave colors and luminosities comparable to intermediate age LMC clusters.\n", "  We present a model to explain the decrease in the amplitude of the pulse\nprofile with increasing energy observed in Geminga's soft X-ray surface thermal\nemission. We assume the presence of plates surrounded by a surface with very\ndistinct physical properties: these two regions emit spectra of very distinct\nshapes which present a crossover, the warm plates emitting a softer spectrum\nthan the colder surrounding surface. The strongly pulsed emission from the\nplates dominates at low energy while the surroundings emission dominates at\nhigh energy, producing naturally a strong decrease in the pulsed fraction. In\nour illustrative example the plates are assumed to be magnetized while the rest\nof the surface is field free.\n  This plate structure may be seen as a schematic representation of a\ncontinuous but very nonuniform distribution of the surface magnetic field or as\na quasi realistic structure induced by past tectonic activity on Geminga.\n", "  We have analyzed the Ulysses, BATSE, and COMPTEL spectral data from the\n$\\gamma$-ray burst of June 22, 1992 (GB 920622). COMPTEL data reveal a hard to\nsoft evolution within the first pulse of the burst, while the mean hardness\nratios of the three pulses are the same. Unlike the single instrument spectra,\nthe composite spectrum of GB 920622 averaged over the total burst duration\nranging from 20 keV up to 10 MeV cannot be fit by a single power law. Instead,\nthe spectrum shows continuous curvature across the full energy range. COMPTEL\nimaging and BATSE/Ulysses triangulation constrain the source location of GB\n920622 to a ring sector 1.1 arcmin wide and 2 degrees long. This area has been\nsearched for quiescent X-ray sources using \\ros survey data collected about two\nyears before the burst. After the optical identification of the X-ray sources\nin and near the GRB location we conclude that no quiescent X-ray counterpart\ncandidate for GB 920622 has been found.\n", "  The Tolman-Bondi solution of the Einstein equations is used in order to model\nthe time evolution of the void observed in Bo\\\"otes. The present density\ncontrast of the central region ($\\sim -0.75$) and its radius ($\\sim 30h^{-1} \\\nMpc$) are fixed, while the density parameter of the Universe, the amplitude of\nthe density contrast inside the void wall, the width of this wall and the\ndistance from the void centre to the Local Group are appropriately varied. The\nmicrowave background anisotropy produced by Bo\\\"otes-like voids is estimated\nfor a significant set of locations. All the voids are placed far from the last\nscattering surface. It is shown that the anisotropy generated by these voids\nstrongly depends on the density parameter, the wall structure and the void\nlocation. The Doppler dipole and quadrupole are subtracted and the residual\nanisotropy is calculated. In the case of some isolated Bo\\\"otes-like voids\nplaced at redshifts between 1 and 10 in an open universe with density parameter\n$\\Omega_{0}=0.2$, the residual anisotropy appears to be a few times $10^{-6}$\non scales of a few degrees. This anisotropy is about one order of magnitude\ngreater than previous estimates corresponding to other cases. The anisotropy\nproduced by a distribution of voids is qualitatively studied in the light of\nthis result. Comparisons with previous estimates are discussed.\n", "  We present data from high-dispersion echelle spectra and simultaneous $uvby$\nphotometry for $\\gamma$~Doradus. These data were obtained from several sites\nduring 1994 November as part of the MUSICOS-94 campaign. The star has two\nclosely-spaced periods of about 0.75 d and is the brightest member of a new\nclass of variable early F-type stars. A previously suspected third period, very\nclose to the other two, is confirmed. Previous observations indicated that\nsudden changes could be expected in the spectrum, but none were found during\nthe campaign. The radial velocities rule out the possibility of a close\ncompanion. The phasing between the radial velocity and light curve of the\nstrongest periodic component rules out the starspot model. The only viable\nmechanism for understanding the variability is nonradial pulsation. We used the\nmethod of moments to identify the modes of pulsation of the three periodic\ncomponents. These appear to be sectorial retrograde modes with spherical\nharmonic degrees, ($\\ell, m$), as follows: $f_1$ = (3,3), $f_2$ = (1,1) and\n$f_4$ = (1,1). The angle of inclination of the star is found to be $i \\approx\n70^\\circ$.\n", "  We describe a technique that uses radial color gradients in disk galaxies to\ndetect the presence of bulk non-circular motion or elliptical orbits. In a disk\ngalaxy with both a radial color gradient and non-circular motion, isochromes or\niso-color contours should follow the shape of closed stellar orbits, and the\nellipticity of the isophotes should vary as a function of wavelength. A\ndifference in the ellipticity of isochromes and the isophotes can be used to\ndetect the presence of non-circular motion. A model galaxy is constructed which\ndemonstrates this phenomenon. The difference between isochrome and isophote\nellipticity is directly related to the ellipticity of the potential. This\nprovides a new way to measure the ellipticity of the dark matter in the outer\nparts of galaxies.\n  As an example, we apply this technique to two dwarf galaxies NGC 1800 and NGC\n7764. We detect a bar in NGC 1800 which has only previously been suggested from\nthe HI velocity field. In NGC 7764 there is no color gradient along its bar so\nwe cannot detect non-circular motion in this region; however ellipticities\nobserved in a star forming ring at the end of the bar are consistent with this\nring being located near the corotation resonance.\n", "  A cosmological multidimensional hydrodynamic code is described and tested.\nThis code is based on modern high-resolution shock-capturing techniques. It can\nmake use of a linear or a parabolic cell reconstruction as well as an\napproximate Riemann solver. The code has been specifically designed for\ncosmological applications. Two tests including shocks have been considered: the\nfirst one is a standard shock tube and the second test involves a spherically\nsymmetric shock. Various additional cosmological tests are also presented. In\nthis way, the performance of the code is proved. The usefulness of the code is\ndiscussed; in particular, this powerful tool is expected to be useful in order\nto study the evolution of the hot gas component located inside nonsymmetric\ncosmological structures.\n", "  We present simultaneous H$\\alpha$, Na~{\\sc i} D$_{1}$, D$_{2}$, and He~{\\sc\ni} D$_{3}$ spectroscopic observations on the RS CVn system UX Ari. We have\nfound a dramatic increase in the excess H$\\alpha$ emission equivalent width by\na factor of 2 in an interval of 1 day that indicates the beginning of a strong\nflare in this system. The presence of the He~{\\sc i} D$_{3}$ in emission in\ncoincidence with the enhancement of the H$\\alpha$ emission confirms the\ndetection of a flare. The application of the spectral subtraction technique\nreveals that the core of the Na~{\\sc i} D$_{1}$ and D$_{2}$ lines are also\nfilled-in by chromospheric emission.\n", "  During the fifth flight of the Microwave Anisotropy Experiment (MAX5), we\nrevisited a region with significant dust emission near the star Mu Pegasi. A\n3.5 cm$^{-1}$ low frequency channel has been added since the previous\nmeasurement (\\cite{mei93a}). The data in each channel clearly show structure\ncorrelated with IRAS 100 \\micron\\ dust emission. The spectrum of the structure\nin the 6, 9 and 14 cm$^{-1}$ channels is described by\n$I_{\\nu}\\propto\\nu^{\\beta}B_{\\nu}(T_{dust})$, where $\\beta$ = 1.3 and\n$T_{dust}$ = 19~K and $B_{\\nu}$ is the Planck function. However, this model\npredicts a smaller amplitude in the 3.5 cm$^{-1}$ band than is observed.\nConsidering only linear combinations of the data independent of the best fit\nforeground spectrum for the three lower channels, we find an upper limit to\nCMBR fluctuations of $\\Delta T/T = \\langle\n\\frac{C_l~l(l+1)}{2\\pi}\\rangle^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\leq 1.3\\times 10^{-5}$ at the\n95\\% confidence level. The result is for a flat band power spectrum and does\nnot include a 10\\% uncertainty in calibration. It is consistent with our\nprevious observation in the region.\n", "  We describe and compare two types of microwave sky simulations which are good\nfor small angular scales. The first type uses expansions in spherical\nharmonics, and the second one is based on plane waves and the Fast Fourier\nTransform. The angular power spectrum is extracted from maps corresponding to\nboth types of simulations, and the resulting spectra are appropriately\ncompared. In this way, the features and usefulness of Fourier simulations are\npointed out. For $\\ell \\geq 100$, all the simulations lead to similar\naccuracies; however, the CPU cost of Fourier simulations is $\\sim 10$ times\nsmaller than that for spherical harmonic simulations. For $\\ell \\leq 100$, the\nsimulations based on spherical harmonics seem to be preferable.\n", "  The predictions of the abundances of D and \\he3 from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis\n(BBN) and recent observations of these two isotopes suggest the need to develop\nnew chemical evolution models. In particular, we examine the role of an early\nepisode of massive star formation that would induce a strong destruction of D\nand a galactic wind. We discuss the ability of these models to match the\nobserved local properties of the solar neighborhood such as the gas mass\nfraction, oxygen abundance, the age-metallicity relation, and the present-day\nmass function (PDMF). We also examine in detail the ability of the chemical\nevolution models discussed to reproduce the apparent lack of low mass, low\nmetallicity stars in the solar neighborhood, namely the G-dwarf distribution.\nIndeed, we find models which satisfy the above constraints while at the same\ntime allowing for a large primordial D/H ratio as is reportedly measured in\nsome quasar absorption systems at high $z$, without the overproduction of heavy\nelements. The latter constraint is achieved by employing a simple dynamical\nmodel for a galactic wind.\n", "  In this paper, we focus our attention on the following question: How well can\nwe recover the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background from the maps\nof a given experiment?. Each experiment is described by a a pixelization scale,\na beam size, a noise level and a sky coverage. We use accurate numerical\nsimulations of the microwave sky and a cold dark matter model for structure\nformation in the universe. Angular scales smaller than those of previous\nsimulations are included. The spectrum obtained from the simulated maps is\nappropriately compared with the theoretical one. Relative deviations between\nthese spectra are estimated. Various contributions to these deviations are\nanalyzed. The method used for spectra comparisons is discussed.\n", "  We examine the absolute luminosities of 29 SNe Ia in the Calan/Tololo survey.\nWe confirm a relation between the peak luminosity of the SNe and the decline\nrate as measured by the light curve, as suggested by Phillips (1993). We derive\nlinear slopes to this magnitude-decline rate relation in BV(I)kc colors, using\na sample with Bmax-Vmax < 0.2 mag. The scatter around this linear relation (and\nthus the ability to measure SNe Ia distances) ranges from 0.13 mag (in the I\nband) to 0.17 mag (in the B band). We also find evidence for significant\ncorrelations between the absolute magnitudes or the decline rate of the light\ncurve, and the morphological type of the host galaxy.\n", "  The Calan/Tololo supernova survey has discovered ~30 Type Ia supernovae out\nto z~0.1. Using BVI data for these objects and nearby SNe Ia, we have shown\nthat there exists a significant dispersion in the intrinsic luminosities of\nthese objects. We have devised a robust chisquare minimization technique\nsimultaneously fitting the BVI light curves to parametrize the SN event as a\nfunction of (tb,m, m15(B)) where tb is the time of B maximum, m is the peak BVI\nmagnitude corrected for luminosity variations, and m15(B) is a single parameter\ndescribing the whole light curve morphology. When properly corrected for\nm15(B), SNe Ia prove to be high precision distance indicators,yielding relative\ndistances with errors 7-10%. The corrected peak magnitudes are used to\nconstruct BVI Hubble diagrams (HD), and with Cepheid distances recently\nmeasured with the HST to four nearby SNe Ia (37C, 72E, 81B, 90N) we derive a\nvalue of the Hubble constant of 63.1+/-3.4 (internal) km/s/Mpc. This value is\n~10-15% larger than the value obtained by assuming that SNe Ia are perfect\nstandard candles. As we have shown in Paper V, there is now strong evidence\nthat galaxies with younger stellar population appear to host the\nslowest-declining, and therefore most luminous SNe Ia. Hence, the use of Pop I\nobjects such as Cepheids to calibrate the zero point of the SNe Ia HD can\neasily bias the results toward luminous SNe Ia, unless the absolute\nmagnitude-decline relation is taken into account.\n", "  We present a family of six BVI template light curves for SNe Ia for days -5\nand +80, based on high-quality data gathered at CTIO. These templates display a\nwide range of light curve morphologies, with initial decline rates of their B\nlight curves between m15(B)=0.87 mag and 1.93 mag. We use these templates to\nstudy the general morphology of SNe Ia light curves. We find that several of\nthe main features of the BVI templates correlate tightly with m15(B). In\nparticular, the V light curves, which are probably a reasonably good\napproximation of the bolometric light curves, display an orderly progression in\nshapes between the most-luminous, slowest-declining events and the\nleast-luminous, fastest-declining SNe. This supports the idea that the observed\nspectroscopic and photometric sequences of SNe Ia are due primarily to one\nparameter. Nevertheless, SNe with very similar initial decline rates do show\nsignificant differences in their light curve properties when examined in\ndetail, suggesting the influence of one or more secondary parameters.\n", "  BVRI light curves are presented for 27 Type Ia supernovae discovered during\nthe course of the Calan/Tololo Survey and for two other SNe Ia observed during\nthe same period. Estimates of the maximum light magnitudes in the B, V, and I\nbands and the initial decline rate parameter m15(B) are also given.\n", "  The reheating process in inflationary universe models is considered as an\nout-of-equilibrium mixture of two interacting and reacting fluids, and studied\nwithin the framework of causal, irreversible thermodynamics. The evolution of\nthe temperature and the decay rate as determined by causal thermodynamics are\nestimated at different stages of the process. A simple model is also used to\nfind the perturbations of the expansion rate, including the possibility of\ndamped oscillations.\n", "  The cumulene carbenes are important components of hydrocarbon chemistry in\nlow mass star forming cores. Here we report the first astronomical detection of\nthe long chain cumulene carbene H_2C_6 in the interstellar cloud TMC1, from\nobservations of two of its rotational transitions: $J_{K,K'} = 7_{1,7}\n\\rightarrow 6_{1,6}$ at 18.8 GHz and $8_{1,8} \\rightarrow 7_{1,7}$ at 21.5 GHz,\nusing NASA's Deep Space Network 70 m antenna at Goldstone, California. In\naddition we also observed the shorter cumulene carbene, H_2C_4 at the same\nposition. The fractional abundance of H_2C_6 relative to H_2 is about $4.7\n\\times 10^{-11}$ and H_2C_4 is about $1.1 \\times 10^{-9}$. The abundance of\nH_2C_6 is in fairly good agreement with gas phase chemical models for young\nmolecular cloud cores, but the abundance of H_2C_4 is significantly larger than\npredicted.\n", "  White dwarfs can be used as galactic chronometers and, therefore, provide\nimportant information about galactic evolution if good theoretical models of\ntheir cooling are available. Consequently, it is natural to wonder if all the\nsources or sinks of energy are correctly taken into account. One of these\nsources is partial differentiation of the chemical components of the white\ndwarf upon crystallization. In this paper we use a new formalism to show that\nif there is a redistribution of the elements inside the star, there is a net\nrelease of energy that has to be radiated away and that slows down the cooling\nrate of the white dwarf.\n", "  We present a library of Utrecht echelle spectrograph (UES) observations of a\nsample of F, G, K and M field dwarf stars covering the spectral range from 4800\nAA to 10600 AA with a resolution of 55000. These spectra include some of the\nspectral lines most widely used as optical and near-infrared indicators of\nchromospheric activity such as H_beta, Mg I b triplet, Na I D_1, D_2, He I D_3,\nH_alpha, and Ca II IRT lines, as well as a large number of photospheric lines\nwhich can also be affected by chromospheric activity. The spectra have been\ncompiled with the aim of providing a set of standards observed at\nhigh-resolution to be used in the application of the spectral subtraction\ntechnique to obtain the active-chromosphere contribution to these lines in\nchromospherically active single and binary stars. This library can also be used\nfor spectral classification purposes. A digital version with all the spectra is\navailable via ftp and the World Wide Web (WWW) in both ASCII and FITS formats.\n", "  We analyse the formation of cosmic structures in models where the dark matter\nis dominated by light gravitinos with mass of $ 100$ eV -- 1 keV, as predicted\nby gauge-mediated supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking models. After evaluating the\nnumber of degrees of freedom at the gravitinos decoupling ($g_*$), we compute\nthe transfer function for matter fluctuations and show that gravitinos behave\nlike warm dark matter (WDM) with free-streaming scale comparable to the galaxy\nmass scale. We consider different low-density variants of the WDM model, both\nwith and without cosmological constant, and compare the predictions on the\nabundances of neutral hydrogen within high-redshift damped Ly--$\\alpha$ systems\nand on the number density of local galaxy clusters with the corresponding\nobservational constraints. We find that none of the models satisfies both\nconstraints at the same time, unless a rather small $\\Omega_0$ value ($\\mincir\n0.4$) and a rather large Hubble parameter ($\\magcir 0.9$) is assumed.\nFurthermore, in a model with warm + hot dark matter, with hot component\nprovided by massive neutrinos, the strong suppression of fluctuation on scales\nof $\\sim 1\\hm$ precludes the formation of high-redshift objects, when the\nlow--$z$ cluster abundance is required. We conclude that all different variants\nof a light gravitino DM dominated model show strong difficulties for what\nconcerns cosmic structure formation.\n  This gives a severe cosmological constraint on the gauge-mediated SUSY\nbreaking scheme.\n", "  We report the discovery of a new gravitational lens candidate Q2138-431AB,\ncomprising two quasar images at a redshift of 1.641 separated by 4.5 arcsecs.\nThe spectra of the two images are very similar, and the redshifts agree to\nbetter than 115 km.sec$^{-1}$. The two images have magnitudes $B_J = 19.8$ and\n$B_J = 21.0$, and in spite of a deep search and image subtraction procedure, no\nlensing galaxy has been found with $R < 23.8$. Modelling of the system\nconfiguration implies that the mass-to-light ratio of any lensing galaxy is\nlikely to be around $1000 M_{\\odot}/L_{\\odot}$, with an absolute lower limit of\n$200 M_{\\odot}/L_{\\odot}$ for an Einstein-de Sitter universe. We conclude that\nthe most likely explanation of the observations is gravitational lensing by a\ndark galaxy, although it is possible we are seeing a binary quasar.\n", "  The spectral indexes distribution of a quasar sample is derived from a far-UV\nsurvey. A red average spectrum is found which comes in support of significant\nevolution of the QSO spectral energy distribution (SED) since $z\\approx2.5$.\n", "  We report the first results of a color-magnitude diagram survey of 25\ncandidate old LMC clusters. For almost all of the sample, it was possible to\nreach the turnoff region, and in many clusters we have several magnitudes of\nthe main sequence. Age estimates based on the magnitude difference $\\delta T_1$\nbetween the giant branch clump and the turnoff revealed that no new old\nclusters were found. The candidates turned out to be of intermediate age (1-3\nGyr) We show that the apparently old ages as inferred from integrated UBV\ncolors can be explained by a combination of stochastic effects produced by\nbright stars and by photometric errors for faint clusters lying in crowded\nfields. The relatively metal poor candidates from the CaII triplet spectroscopy\nalso turned out to be of intermediate age. This, combined with the fact that\nthey lie far out in the disk, yields interesting constraints regarding the\nformation and evolution of the LMC disk. We also study the age distribution of\nintermediate age and old clusters This homogeneous set of accurate relative\nages allows us to make an improved study of the history of cluster\nformation/destruction for ages $>1$Gyr. We confirm previous indications that\nthere was apparently no cluster formation in the LMC during the period from 3-8\nGyr ago, and that there was a pronounced epoch of cluster formation beginning 3\nGyrs ago that peaked at about 1.5 Gyrs ago. Our results suggest that there are\nfew, if any, genuine old clusters in the LMC left to be found.\n", "  In the framework of the fluctuation-dissipation approach to dynamical\nfriction, we derive an expression giving the orbital energy exchange\nexperienced by a compound body as it moves interacting with a non homogeneous\ndiscrete background. The body is assumed to be composed of particles endowed\nwith a velocity spectrum and with a non homogeneous spatial distribution. The\nChandrasekhar formula is recovered in the limit of a point-like satellite with\nzero velocity dispersion and infinite temperature moving through an homogeneous\ninfinite medium. In this same limit, but dropping the zero satellite velocity\ndispersion ($\\sigma_S$) condition, the orbital energy loss is found to be\nsmaller than in the $\\sigma_S=0$ case by a factor of up to an order of\nmagnitude in some situations.\n", "  Motivated by recent experimental proposals to search for extragalactic cosmic\nrays (including anti-matter from distant galaxies), we study particle\npropagation through the intergalactic medium (IGM). We first use estimates of\nthe magnetic field strength between galaxies to constrain the mean free path\nfor diffusion of particles through the IGM. We then develop a simple analytic\nmodel to describe the diffusion of cosmic rays. Given the current age of\ngalaxies, our results indicate that, in reasonable models, a completely\nnegligible number of particles can enter our Galaxy from distances greater than\n$\\sim 100$ Mpc for relatively low energies ($E$ $< 10^6$ GeV/n). We also find\nthat particle destruction in galaxies along the diffusion path produces an\nexponential suppression of the possible flux of extragalactic cosmic rays.\nFinally, we use gamma ray constraints to argue that the distance to any\nhypothetical domains of anti-matter must be roughly comparable to the horizon\nscale.\n", "  Classical novae are important producers of radioactive nuclei, such as be7,\nn13, f18, na22 and al26. The disintegration of these nuclei produces positrons\n(except for be7) that through annihilation with electrons produce photons of\nenergies 511 keV and below. Furthermore, be7 and na22 decay producing photons\nwith energies of 478 keV and 1275 keV, respectively, well in the gamma-ray\ndomain. Therefore, novae are potential sources of gamma-ray emission. The\nproperties of gamma-ray spectra and gamma-ray light curves (for the continuum\nand for the lines at 511, 478 and 1275 keV) have been analyzed, with a special\nemphasis on the difference between carbon-oxygen and oxygen-neon novae.\nPredictions of detectability of individual novae by the future SPI spectrometer\non board the INTEGRAL satellite are made.\n", "  We investigate the possibility that gamma-ray bursts originate in a\nconcentric spherical shell with a given average redshift and find that this is\nindeed compatible with the data from the third BATSE (3B) catalog. It is also\nshown that there is enough freedom in the choice of unknown burst properties to\nallow even for extremely large distances to the majority of bursts. Therefore,\nwe speculate about an early, and very energetic, origin of bursts, and suggest\nthat they come from phase transitions in massive objects of pure quark matter,\nleft over from the Big Bang.\n", "  Clustering statistics are compared in the Automatic Plate Machine (APM) and\nthe Edinburgh/Durham Southern Galaxy Catalogue (EDSGC) angular galaxy surveys.\nBoth surveys were independently constructed from scans of the same adjacent UK\nIIIa--J Schmidt photographic plates with the APM and COSMOS microdensitometers,\nrespectively. The comparison of these catalogs is a rare practical opportunity\nto study systematic errors, which cannot be achieved via simulations or\ntheoretical methods. On intermediate scales, $0.1^\\circ < \\theta < 0.5^\\circ$,\nwe find good agreement for the cumulants or reduced moments of counts in cells\nup to sixth order. On larger scales there is a small disagreement due to edge\neffects in the EDSGC, which covers a smaller area. On smaller scales, we find a\nsignificant disagreement that can only be attributed to differences in the\nconstruction of the surveys, most likely the dissimilar deblending of crowded\nfields. The overall agreement of the APM and EDSGC is encouraging, and shows\nthat the results for intermediate scales should be fairly robust. On the other\nhand, the systematic deviations found at small scales are significant in a\nregime, where comparison with theory and simulations is possible. This is an\nimportant fact to bear in mind when planning the construction of future\ndigitized galaxy catalogs.\n", "  For four newly suggested microscopic equations of state of neutron star\nmatter, we construct equilibrium sequences of rapidly rotating neutron stars in\ngeneral relativity. The sequences are the normal and supramassive evolutionary\nsequences of constant rest mass. We find that for these equations of state the\nmaximum (gravitational) mass rotating models occur (in central density and\nrotation rate $\\Omega$) before the maximum--$\\Omega$ models. We calculate\nequilibrium sequences for a constant value of $\\Omega$ corresponding to the\nmost rapidly rotating pulsar PSR 1937+21. Also calculated is the radius of the\nmarginally stable orbit and its dependence on $\\Omega$.\n", "  We show how non-radial motions, originating in the outskirts of clusters of\ngalaxies, may reduce the discrepancy between the Cold Dark Matter (CDM)\npredicted X-ray temperature distribution function of clusters of galaxies and\nthe observed one and also the discrepancy between the CDM predicted two-point\ncorrelation function of clusters of galaxies and that observed. We compare Edge\net al. (1990) and Henry & Arnaud (1991) data with the distribution function of\nX-ray temperature, calculated using Press- Schechter's (1974 - hereafter PS)\ntheory and Evrard's (1990) prescriptions for the mass-temperature relation and\ntaking account of the non-radial motions originating from the gravitational\ninteraction of the quadrupole moment of the protocluster with the tidal field\nof the matter of the neighboring protostructures. We find that the model\nproduces a reasonable clusters temperature distribution. We compare the\ntwo-point cluster correlation function which takes account of the non-radial\nmotions both with that obtained by Sutherland & Efstathiou (1991), from the\nanalysis of Huchra's et al. (1990) deep redshift survey, and with the data\npoints for the Automatic Plate Measuring (APM) clusters, computed by Efstathiou\net al. (1992a), showing that non-radial motions reduce the discrepancy between\nthe theoretical and the obsservational correlation function.\n", "  Primordial black holes with a narrow mass range are regarded as a\nnonrelativistic fluid component with an equation of state for dust. The impact\nof the black hole evaporation on the dynamics of the early universe is studied\nby resorting to a two-fluid model. We find periods of intense radiation\nreheating in the initial and final stages of the evaporation.\n", "  The understanding of the nature of intermediate and high velocity gas in the\nMilky Way is hampered by a paucity of distance estimates to individual clouds.\nA project has been started at the David Dunlap Observatory to address this lack\nof distance measures by observing early-type stars along the line of sight\ntowards these clouds and searching for sodium doublet absorption at the clouds'\nsystemic velocities. Distances to foreground stars (no absorption) and\nbackground stars (with absorption) are estimated from spectroscopic parallax,\nand thus the distance to the bracketed cloud is estimated. In this Letter, we\npresent the first result from this ongoing project, a measurement of the\ndistance to the Draco Cloud, which is the most studied of the intermediate\nvelocity clouds. The result presented here is the first distance bracket which\ntightly constrains the position of the Draco Cloud. We briefly describe our\ntarget selection and observing methodology, and then demonstrate absorption at\nthe velocity of the Draco Cloud for one star (TYC~4194~2188), and a lack of\nabsorption for several other stars. We derive a distance bracket to the Draco\nCloud of 463$^{+192}_{-136}$ to 618$^{+243}_{-174}$~pc.\n", "  The influence of the initial composition and structure of the exploding white\ndwarf on the nucleosynthesis and structure of Type Ia Supernovae has been\nstudied.\n  The progenitor structures are based on detailed stellar evolutionary tracks\nfor stars in the mass range between 1 to 9 $M_\\odot$ using the state of the art\ncode FRANEC.\n  The calculations of the thermonuclear explosions are based on a set of\ndelayed detonation models which give a good account of the optical and infrared\nlight curves and of the spectral evolution.\n  Our code solves the hydrodynamical equations explicitly by the piecewise\nparabolic method.\n  Nuclear burning is taken into account using an extended network of 218\nnuclei.\n  In principle, our calculations allow the observed spectra and light curve to\nbe linked to the progenitor. Moreover, our study is relevant to estimate\npotential evolution in the progenitor population at cosmological time scales.\n", "  We present results of an ongoing program to study the gaseous extent of\ngalaxies and the origin of QSO absorption line systems. For \\lya absorption\nsystems, we find that absorption equivalent width depends strongly on galaxy\nimpact parameter and galaxy $B$-band luminosity, and that the gaseous extent of\nindividual galaxies scales with galaxy $B$-band luminosity as $r\\propto\nL_B^{0.40\\pm0.09}$. Applying the results to galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field\nto calculate the predicted number density of \\lya absorption lines as a\nfunction of redshift and comparing it with observations, we find that at least\n50% and perhaps as much as 100% of \\lya absorption systems with $W\\apg0.32$ \\AA\ncan be explained by the extended gaseous envelops of normal galaxies. The\nanti-correlation analysis has also been performed on \\civ absorption line\nsystems, and the results show that the ionized gas cross section scales with\ngalaxy $B$-band luminosity as $r\\propto L_B^{0.76\\pm0.26}$.\n", "  We have performed a systematic study of several regions in the sky where the\nnumber of galaxies exhibiting star formation (SF) activity is greater than\naverage. We used Kiso ultraviolet-excess galaxies (KUGs) as our SF-enhanced\nsample. By statistically comparing the KUG and non-KUG distributions, we\ndiscovered four KUG-rich regions with a size of $\\sim 10^\\circ \\times\n10^\\circ$. One of these regions corresponds spatially to a filament of length\n$\\sim 60 h^{-1}$ Mpc in the Lynx-Ursa Major region ($\\alpha \\sim 9^{\\rm h} -\n10^{\\rm h}, \\delta \\sim 42^\\circ - 48^\\circ$). We call this ``the Lynx-Ursa\nMajor (LUM) filament''. We obtained $V(RI)_{\\rm C}$ surface photometry of 11 of\nthe KUGs in the LUM filament and used these to investigate the integrated\ncolors, distribution of SF regions, morphologies, and local environments. We\nfound that these KUGs consist of distorted spiral galaxies and compact galaxies\nwith blue colors. Their star formation occurs in the entire disk, and is not\nconfined to just the central regions. The colors of the SF regions imply that\nactive star formation in the spiral galaxies occurred $10^{7 - 8}$ yr ago,\nwhile that of the compact objects occurred $10^{6-7}$ yr ago. Though the\nphotometric characteristics of these KUGs are similar to those of interacting\ngalaxies or mergers, most of these KUGs do not show direct evidence of merger\nprocesses.\n", "  We try to apply the cosmic crystallography method of Lehoucq, Lachieze-Rey,\nand Luminet to a universe model with closed spatial section of negative\ncurvature. But the sharp peaks predicted for Einstein-de Sitter closed models\ndo not appear in our hyperbolic example. So we turn to a variant of that\nmethod, by subtracting from the distribution of distances between images in the\nclosed model, the similar distribution in Friedmann's open model. The result is\na plot with much oscillation in small scales, modulated by a long wavelength\nquasi-sinusoidal pattern.\n", "  Coronal Mass Ejections continuously drag closed magnetic field lines away\nfrom the Sun, adding new flux to the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). We\npropose that the outward-moving blobs that have been observed in helmet\nstreamers are evidence of ongoing, small-scale reconnection in streamer current\nsheets, which may play an important role in the prevention of an indefinite\nbuildup of the IMF. Reconnection between two open field lines from both sides\nof a streamer current sheet creates a new closed field line, which becomes part\nof the helmet, and a disconnected field line, which moves outward. The blobs\nare formed by plasma from the streamer that is swept up in the trough of the\noutward moving field line. We show that this mechanism is supported by\nobservations from SOHO/LASCO. Additionally, we propose a thorough statistical\nstudy to quantify the contribution of blob formation to the reduction of the\nIMF, and indicate how this mechanism may be verified by observations with\nSOHO/UVCS and the proposed NASA STEREO and ESA Polar Orbiter missions.\n", "  We simulate the dynamical, chemical, and spectro-photometric evolution of\ndwarf and normal elliptical galaxies embedded in a dark matter halo, using a\nthree-dimensional N-body/SPH simulation code. For the forming dwarf elliptical\ngalaxies, supernova-driven winds propagating outwards from inside the system\ncollide with the infalling gas and produce the super-shell in which stars are\nformed. The resulting stellar system forms a loosely bound virialized system\ndue to the significant mass loss and has a large velocity dispersion and a\nlarge core. Consequently the surface brightness distribution shows an\nexponential profile and the color distribution shows a positive gradient such\nthat the colors become redder away from the galaxy center in agreement with\nobservations. On the other hand, for the normal elliptical galaxies with deep\ngravitational potential, the mass loss out of the system does not have a\nsignificant dynamical effect on the stellar system. The resulting surface\nbrightness distribution has a large central concentration like de Vaucouleurs'\n$r^{1/4}$-profile and the color distribution shows a negative gradient as\nobserved. Our simulation shows that different features between dwarf and normal\nelliptical galaxies stem from different cooling efficiencies for their\nrespective protogalaxies in a standard CDM universe.\n", "  We propose a formula for flux of extremely high energy cosmic rays (EHECR)\nthrough decay of superheavy particles. It is shown that EHECR spectrum reported\nby AGASA is reproduced by the formula.\n  The presence of EHECR suggests, according to this approach, the existence of\nsuperheavy particles with mass of about $7 \\times 10^{11}$GeV and the lifetime\nof about $10^9$ years.\n  Possibility to obtain a knowledge of $\\Omega_0$ of the universe from the\nspectrum of EHECR is also pointed out.\n", "  We present in this work secondary catalogs up to $m_{Val} \\sim 13$ based on\nthe Tycho reference frame (ESA, 1997) for 12 selected low-extinction fields\ntowards the galactic bulge. The observations have been performed with the\nAskania-Zeiss Meridian Circle equiped with a CCD camera, located at the\nAbrah\\~ao de Moraes Observatory (Valinhos, Brazil) and operated by the\nInstitute of Astronomy and Geophysics, S\\~ao Paulo University. The presented\ncatalog, though not complete, has been designed to help in intensive search\nprogrammes (e.g. microlensing and variable searches) and therefore the selected\nstandards have a high astrometric and photometric ($V$ band, approximately)\nquality. The mean precisions obtained were $0.0018^{s}$ in $\\alpha$, 0.013'' in\n$\\delta$, 0.030 for the standard deviation in magnitude and 0.0042 for the\nmagnitude when weighted with the error bars in each night (in the mean, 42\nstars for the catalog of each window). Tables B.1 to B.12 are also available in\neletronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr\n(130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/Abstract.html.\n", "  Intensive monitoring of low-extinction windows towards the galactic bulge has\nprovided in the last years valuable information for studies about the dynamics,\nkinematics and formation history of this part of the galaxy, mainly by\ncharacterizing the bulge stellar populations (Paczy\\'nski, 1996). Since 1997,\nwe have been conducting an intensive photometric-astrometric survey of the\ngalactic bulge, with the monitoring of about 120000 stars in 12 windows\nuniformly distributed in galactic latitude and longitude (Blanco & Terndrup,\n1989 e Blanco, 1988) never before submitted to this kind of survey. For this\npurpose, we have used the IAG/USP CCD Meridian Circle of the Abrah\\~ao de\nMoraes Observatory. The main objective of this work is the identification and\nclassification of variable objects. In this work we present the set up and\ndevelopment of the necessary tools for a project like this and the posterior\nanalysis of our data. We briefly describe the construction of a program to\norganize and detect variables among the observed stars, including real time\nalerts (for variations greater than 0.3 magnitudes). The preliminary analysis\nafter the processing of 76 nights of observation yielded 479 variable stars,\nfrom which 96.7 % of them are new. We discuss the preliminary classification of\nthis variables, based on: a) the observed amplitude of variation; b) the shape\nof light curve; c) the expected variable classes among our data and d) the\ncalculated periods, whenever possible. Finally, we discuss the future\nperspectives for the project and for the applications and analysis of the\ndiscovered variable stars.\n", "  The ISO coronal line spectrum of the brightest Seyfert galaxies from the CfA\nsample is presented and modeled. ISO observations of [O IV] 25.9 $\\mu$, [Ne V]\n14.3 $\\mu$, [Mg VIII] 3.02 $\\mu$ and [Si IX] 2.58 $\\mu$ lines are presented;\ntheir relationship with the soft part of the ionizing spectrum from 50 to 300\neV is investigated. Pure photoionization models reproduce the line ratios,\nsetting ranges for the ionization parameter and the optical depth of the\nemitting clouds. On the basis of the available data alone it is not possible to\ndistinguish between a power-law or a blackbody distribution as the intrinsic\nshape of the UV ionizing spectrum. However, for the brightest Seyferts\nanalyzed, namely, NGC 1068, Circinus and NGC 4151, a black-body UV continuum is\nfavored.\n", "  We report the results of our multi-wavelength observations of GRS 1758-258\nmade in August 1997. The energy bands include radio, millimeter, X-ray, and\ngamma-ray. The observations enable us to obtain a complete spectrum of the\nsource over an energy range of 2 - 500 keV. The spectrum shows that GRS\n1758-258 was in its hard state. It is well fitted by the Sunyaev-Titarchuk (ST)\nCompton scattering model. The spectrum is also fit by a power law with an\nexponential cutoff (PLE) plus a soft black-body component. The temperature of\nthe soft component is about 1.2 keV, and the energy flux is less than 1.5% of\nthe total X- and gamma-ray flux. The deduced hydrogen column density is in the\nrange of (0.93 - 2.0) 10^{22} cm^{-2}. No significant iron lines are detected.\nThe radio emission has a flat energy spectrum. The daily radio, X-ray and\ngamma-ray light curves show that GRS 1758-258 was stable during the observation\nperiod, but was highly variable on smaller time scales in X- and gamma-rays.\nThe power density spectra are typical for the low-state, but we find the photon\nflux for the 5 to 10 keV band to be more variable than that in the other two\nenergy bands (2 - 5 keV and 10 - 40 keV). Harmonically spaced quasi-periodic\noscillations (QPOs) are observed in the power spectra. The phase lags between\nthe hard photons and the soft photons have a flat distribution over a wide\nrange of frequencies. A high coherence of about 1.0 (0.01 - 1 Hz) between the\nhard photons and the soft photons is also obtained in our observations. We\ncompare these results with two variation models. Our millimeter observations\ndid not reveal any conclusive signatures of an interaction between the jet from\nGRS 1758-258 and the molecular cloud that lies in the direction of GRS\n1758-258.\n", "  We report ISO (Infrared Space Observatory) observations of a new infrared\nsource discovered in the vicinity of the young populous cluster NGC 330 in the\nSmall Magellanic Cloud. The object was observed with ISOCAM at 4.5, 6.75 and\n11.5 $\\mu$m and shows a prominent mid-infrared excess, indicating the presence\nof a dust shell. The available observations of the optical counterpart together\nwith the mid-infrared ISOCAM data suggest that this object is most likely a\npost-AGB star, or a Be supergiant. Cluster membership and candidate\nevolutionary scenarios are discussed briefly.\n", "  The Hubble Deep Field images have provided us with a unique chance to relate\nstatistical properties of high-redshift galaxies to statistical properties of\n\\lya absorption systems. Combining an {\\em empirical} measure of the galaxy\nsurface density versus redshift with an {\\em empirical} measure of the gaseous\nextent of galaxies, we predict the number density of \\lya absorption systems\nthat originate in extended gaseous envelopes of galaxies versus redshift. We\nshow that at least 50% and as much as 100% of observed \\lya absorption systems\nof $W\\apg0.32$ \\AA can be explained by extended gaseous envelops of galaxies.\nTherefore, we conclude that known galaxies of known gaseous extent must produce\na significant fraction and perhaps all of \\lya absorption systems over a large\nredshift range.\n", "  We discuss the prospects for parity non-conservation experiments with highly\ncharged heavy ions. Energy levels and parity mixing for heavy ions with two to\nfive electrons are calculated. We investigate two-photon-transitions and the\npossibility to observe interference effects between weak-matrix elements and\nStark matrix elements for periodic electric field configurations.\n", "  We study in more detail the properties of the generalized Beth Uhlenbeck\nformula obtained in a preceding article. This formula leads to a simple\nintegral expression of the grand potential of the system, where the interaction\npotential appears only through the matrix elements of the second order Ursell\noperator $U_{2}$. Our results remain valid for significant degree of degeneracy\nof the gas, but not when Bose Einstein (or BCS) condensation is reached, or\neven too close from this transition point. We apply them to the study of the\nthermodynamic properties of degenerate quantum gases: equation of state,\nmagnetic susceptibility, effects of exchange between bound states and free\nparticles, etc. We compare our predictions to those obtained within other\napproaches, especially the ``pseudo potential'' approximation, where the real\npotential is replaced by a potential with zero range (Dirac delta function).\nThis comparison is conveniently made in terms of a temperature dependent\nquantity, the ``Ursell length'', which we define in the text. This length plays\na role which is analogous to the scattering length for pseudopotentials, but it\nis temperature dependent and may include more physical effects than just binary\ncollision effects; for instance at very low temperatures it may change sign or\nincrease almost exponentially, an effect which is reminiscent of a precursor of\nthe BCS pairing transition. As an illustration, numerical results for quantum\nhard spheres are given.\n", "  Dynamics of classical scattering in the system of fermions is studied. The\nmodel is based on the coherent state representation and the equations of motion\nfor fermions are derived from the time-dependent variational principle. It is\nfound that the antisymmetrization due to the Pauli exclusion principle, may\nlead to hyperbolic chaotic scattering even in the absence of interaction\nbetween particles. At low bombarding energies, the same effect leads to the\nscreening of the hard, short-ranged component in the two particle interaction\nand thus regularizes the dynamics.\n", "  We discuss chaotic advection in three-dimensional unsteady incompressible\nlaminar flow, and analyse in detail the most important novel advection\nphenomenon in these flows; the global dispersion of passive scalars in flows\nwith two slow and one fast velocity components. We make a comprehensive study\nof the first model of an experimentally realizable flow to exhibit this {\\it\nresonance-induced\\/} dispersion: biaxial unsteady spherical Couette flow is a\nthree-dimensional incompressible laminar flow with periodic time dependence\nderived analytically from the Navier--Stokes equations in the\nlow-Reynolds-number limit.\n", "  The two-point correlation function of energy levels for free motion on the\nmodular domain, both with periodic and Dirichlet boundary conditions, are\nexplicitly computed using a generalization of the Hardy-Littlewood method. It\nis shown that ion the limit of small separations they show an uncorrelated\nbehaviour and agree with the Poisson distribution but they have prominent\nnumber-theoretical oscillations at larger scale. The results agree well with\nnumerical simulations.\n", "  We introduce and study the first model of an experimentally realizable\nthree-dimensional time-dependent nonturbulent fluid flow to display the\nphenomenon of global diffusion of passive-scalar particles at arbitrarily small\nvalues of the nonintegrable perturbation. This type of chaotic advection,\ntermed {\\it resonance-induced diffusion\\/}, is generic for a large class of\nflows.\n", "  We consider the characteristic polynomials of random unitary matrices $U$\ndrawn from various circular ensembles. In particular, the statistics of the\ncoefficients of these polynomials are studied. The variances of these ``secular\ncoefficients'' are given explicitly for arbitrary dimension and continued\nanalytically to arbitrary values of the level repulsion exponent $\\beta$. The\nlatter secular coefficients are related to the traces of powers of $U$ by\nNewton's well-known formulae. While the traces tend to have Gaussian\ndistributions and to be statistically independent among one another in the\nlimit as the matrix dimension grows large, the secular coefficients exhibit\nstrong mutual correlations due to Newton's mixing of traces to coefficients.\nThese results might become relevant for current efforts at combining\nsemiclassics and random-matrix theory in quantum treatments of classically\nchaotic dynamics.\n", "  Convection in a cylindrical container of small aspect ratio is studied. It is\nknown that when, in addition to buoyancy forces, thermocapillarity effects are\ntaken into account, resonant interactions of two modes may appear. In the case\nof 1:2 resonance amplitude equations are derived, showing the existence of a\nstable heteroclinic orbit and rotating waves, until now not observed\nexperimentally.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the study of one-body dissipation effects in\nidealized models resembling a nucleus. In particular, we study the quantum\nmechanics of a free particle that collides elastically with the slowly moving\nwalls of a Bunimovich stadium billiard. Our results are twofold. First, we\ndevelop a method to solve in a simple way the quantum mechanical evolution of\nplanar billiards with moving walls. The formalism is based on the {\\it scaling\nmethod} \\cite{ver} which enables the resolution of the problem in terms of\nquantities defined over the boundary of the billiard. The second result is\nrelated to the quantum aspects of dissipation in systems with complex spectra.\nWe conclude that in a slowly varying evolution the energy is transferred from\nthe boundary to the particle through Landau$-$Zener transitions.\n", "  To study the time decay laws (tdl) of quasibounded hamiltonian systems we\nhave considered two finite potential wells with oscillating walls filled by non\ninteracting particles. We show that the tdl can be qualitatively different for\ndifferent movement of the oscillating wall at classical level according to the\ncharacteristic of trapped periodic orbits. However, the quantum dynamics do not\nshow such differences.\n", "  We construct a model of an excitable medium with elastic rather than the\nusual diffusive coupling. We explore the dynamics of elastic excitable media,\nwhich we find to be dominated by low dimensional structures, including global\noscillations, period-doubled pacemakers, and propagating fronts. We suggest\nthat examples of elastic excitable media are to be found in such diverse\nphysical systems as Burridge-Knopoff models of frictional sliding, electronic\ntransmission lines, and active optical waveguides.\n", "  We apply the Ott, Grebogy and Yorke mechanism for the control of chaos to the\nanalytical oscillator model of a leaky tap obtaining good results. We exhibit\nthe robustness of the control against both dynamical noise and measurement\nnoise.A possible way of controlling experimentally a leaky tap using\nmagnetic-field-produced variations in the viscosity of a magnetorheological\nfluid is suggested.\n", "  Streamlines and distributions of nodal points are used as signatures of chaos\nin coherent electron transport through three types of billiards, Sinai,\nBunimovich and rectangular. Numerical averaged distribution functions of\nnearest distances between nodal points are presented. We find the same form for\nthe Sinai and Bunimovich billiards and suggest that there is a universal form\nthat can be used as a signature of quantum chaos for electron transport in open\nbilliards. The universal distribution function is found to be insensitive to\nthe way avaraging is performed (over positions of leads, over an energy\ninterval with a few conductance fluctuations, or both). The integrable\nrectangular billiard, on the other hand, displays nonuniversal distribution\nwith a central peak related to partial order of nodal points for the case of\nsymmetric attachment of leads. However cases with nonsymmetric leads tend to\nthe universal form.\n  Also it is shown how nodal points in rectangular billiard can lead to\n\"channeling of quantum flows\" while disorder in nodal points in the Sinai\nbilliard gives rise to unstable irregular behavior of the flow.\n", "  We consider the thermodynamics of a uniformly charged polyelectrolyte with\nharmonic bonds. For such a system there is at high temperatures an approximate\nscaling of global properties like the end-to-end distance and the interaction\nenergy with the chain-length divided by the temperature. This scaling is broken\nat low temperatures by the ultraviolet divergence of the Coulomb potential. By\nintroducing a renormalization of the strength of the nearest- neighbour\ninteraction the scaling is restored, making possible an efficient blocking\nmethod for emulating very large polyelectrolytes using small systems. The high\ntemperature behaviour is well reproduced by the analytical high-$T$ expansions\neven for fairly low temperatures and system sizes. In addition, results from\nlow-$T$ expansions, where the coefficients have been computed numerically, are\npresented. These results approximate well the corresponding Monte Carlo results\nat realistic temperatures. A corresponding analysis of screened chains is\nperformed. The situation here is complicated by the appearance of an additional\nparameter, the screening length. A window is found in parameter space, where\nscaling holds for the end-to-end distance. This window corresponds to\nsituations where the range of the potential interpolates between the bond\nlength and the size of the chain. This scaling behaviour, which is verified by\nMonte Carlo results, is consistent with Flory scaling. Also for the screened\nchain a blocking approach can be devised, that performs well for low\ntemperatures, whereas the low-$T$ expansion is inaccurate at realistic\ntemperatures.\n", "  A variational approach, based on a discrete representation of the chain, is\nused to calculate free energy and conformational properties in\npolyelectrolytes. The true bond and Coulomb potentials are approximated by a\ntrial isotropic harmonic energy containing force constants between {\\em\nall}monomer-pairs as variational parameters. By a judicious choice of\nrepresentation and the use of incremental matrix inversion, an efficient and\nfast-convergent iterative algorithm is constructed, that optimizes the free\nenergy. The computational demand scales as $N^3$ rather than $N^4$ as expected\nin a more naive approach. The method has the additional advantage that in\ncontrast to Monte Carlo calculations the entropy is easily computed. An\nanalysis of the high and low temperature limits is given. Also, the variational\nformulation is shown to respect the appropriate virial identities.The accuracy\nof the approximations introduced are tested against Monte Carlo simulations for\nproblem sizes ranging from $N=20$ to 1024. Very good accuracy is obtained for\nchains with unscreened Coulomb interactions. The addition of salt is described\nthrough a screened Coulomb interaction, for which the accuracy in a certain\nparameter range turns out to be inferior to the unscreened case. The reason is\nthat the harmonic variational Ansatz becomes less efficient with shorter range\ninteractions.\n  As a by-product a very efficient Monte Carlo algorithm was developed for\ncomparisons, providing high statistics data for very large sizes -- 2048\nmonomers. The Monte Carlo results are also used to examine scaling properties,\nbased on low-$T$ approximations to end-end and monomer-monomer separations. It\nis argued that the former increases faster than linearly with the number of\nbonds.\n", "  This work reports on the systematic high pressure Raman studies in the\nPbZr$_{1-x}$Ti$_x$O$_3$ ($0.02 \\leq x \\leq 0.14$) ceramics performed at room\ntemperature. The pressure dependence of the Raman spectra reveals the stable\nphases of the material under pressure variation. The results allowed us to\npropose a concentration-pressure phase diagram for rich Zr PZT system up to\npressures of 5.0 GPa.\n", "  The surface phonon dispersion curves of commensurate Xe monolayers on Cu(111)\nand incommensurate Xe monolayers on Cu(001) surfaces have been measured using\nHe atom scattering (HAS) time of flight (TOF) spectroscopy. The TOF spectra are\ninterpreted by combining quantum scattering calculations with the dynamical\nmatrix description of the surface vibrations. Both a vertically polarized\nEinstein-like mode and another, acoustic-like mode of dominantly longitudinal\ncharacter, are identified. The latter mode is characterized by the presence and\nabsence of the zone center frequency gap in the commensurate and incommensurate\nadlayers, respectively. The microscopic description of the TOF spectral\nintensities is based on the extensive theoretical studies of the interplay of\nthe phonon dynamics, projectile-surface potentials, multi-quantum interference\nand projectile recoil, and their effect on the HAS spectra. Both single and\nmulti-quantum spectral features observed over a wide range of He atom incident\nenergies and substrate temperatures are successfully explained by the theory.\n", "  The point-particle-like Hamiltonian of a biaxial spin particle with external\nmagnetic field along the hard axis is obtained in terms of the potential field\ndescription of spin systems with exact spin-coordinate correspondence. The\nZeeman energy term turns out to be an effective gauge potential which leads to\na nonintegrable pha se of the Euclidean Feynman propagator.\n  The phase interference between clockwise and anticlockwise under barrier\npropagations is recognized explicitly as the Aharonov-Bohm effect. An\nadditional phase which is significant for quantum phase interference is\ndiscovered with the quantum theory of spin systems besides the known phase\nobtained with the semiclassical treatment of spin. We also show the energ y\ndependence of the effect and obtain the tunneling splitting at excited states\nwith the help of periodic instantons.\n", "  We propose a simple, versatile and fast computational model tounderstand the\ndeviations from the well-known Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami kinetic\ntheoryfound in metal recrystallization and amorphous semiconductor\ncrystallization. Our model describes in detail the kinetics of the\ntransformation and the grain size distribution of the product material, and is\nin good agreement with the available experimental data. Other morphological and\nkinetic features amenable of experimental observation are outlined, suggesting\nnew directions for further validation of the model.\n", "  In this communication we consider the doping dependence of the strong\nantiferromagnetic spin fluctuations in the cuprate superconductors. We\ninvestigate the effect of an incommensurate magnetic response, as recently\nobserved in inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiments on several\nYBa_2Cu_3O_{6+x} compounds, on the spin-lattice and spin-echo relaxation rates\nmeasured in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. We conclude that a\nconsistent theoretical description of INS and NMR can be reached if one assumes\nspatially inhomogeneous but locally commensurate spin correlations and that NMR\nand INS experiments can be described within a single theoretical scenario. We\ndiscuss a simple scenario of spin and charge inhomogeneities which includes the\nmain physical ingredients required for consistency with experiments.\n", "  We study the temperature-dilution phase diagram of a site-diluted Heisenberg\nantiferromagnet on a fcc lattice, with and without the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\nanisotropic term, fixed to realistic microscopic parameters for $IIB_{1-x} Mn_x\nTe$ (IIB=Cd, Hg, Zn). We show that the dipolar Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya anisotropy\ninduces a finite-temperature phase transition to a spin glass phase, at\ndilutions larger than 80%. The resulting probability distribution of the order\nparameter P(q) is similar to the one found in the cubic lattice\nEdwards-Anderson Ising model. The critical exponents undergo large finite size\ncorrections, but tend to values similar to the ones of the\nEdwards-Anderson-Ising model.\n", "  The phase behavior of binary fluid mixtures of hard hyperspheres in four and\nfive dimensions is investigated. Spinodal instability is found by using a\nrecent and accurate prescription for the equation of state of the mixture that\nrequires the equation of state of the single component fluid as input. The role\nplayed by the dimensionality on the possible metastability of the demixing\ntransition with respect to a fluid-solid transition is discussed. The binodal\ncurves in the pressure--chemical potential representation are seen to lie on a\ncommon line, independent of the size ratio\n", "  In this paper we evaluate the corrections to the Navier-Stokes constitutive\nequations induced by the action of a gravitational field in a gas subjected to\na thermal gradient parallel to the field with no convection. The analysis is\nperformed from an exact perturbation solution of the BGK kinetic model for\nMaxwell molecules through sixth order in the field. The reference state (zeroth\norder approximation) corresponds to the exact solution in the pure planar\nFourier flow, which holds for arbitrary values of the thermal gradient. The\nresults show that the pressure tensor becomes anisotropic, so that the momentum\nflux along the field direction is enhanced. In addition, the heat flux\nincreases (decreases) with respect to its Navier-Stokes value when the gas is\nheated from above (below).\n", "  We present a comparative study of the magnetic, transport and structural\nproperties of $Nd_{0.5}Ca_{0.5}MnO_{3+\\delta}$ [$\\delta=$ 0.02(1) and 0.04(1)].\nWe have found significant differences between the low temperature magnetic\norders and the magnetization curves below $T_{CO}\\approx 250 K$ of the two\nsamples. In particular one component of the magnetic moment presents a\nferromagnetic coupling between the $(0 0 1)$ planes ($P bnm$ setting) deviating\nthe angle between neighboring $Mn$ ions from $180^o$ (perfect CE order) to\n$150^o$ [$\\delta=0.02(1)$] and $130^o$ [$\\delta= 0.04(1)$]. These results imply\na remarkable $\\delta$ dependence which is discussed in the light of a\nnon-random spatial distribution of defects in the perfect charge order scheme.\n", "  We report a new phenomenon occurring in field-responsive suspensions:\nshear-induced anomalous stresses. Competition between a rotating field and a\nshear flow originates a multiplicity of anomalous stress behaviors in\nsuspensions of bounded dimers constituted by induced dipoles. The great variety\nof stress regimes includes non-monotonous behaviors, multi-resonances, negative\nviscosity effect and blockades. The reversibility of the transitions between\nthe different regimes and the self-similarity of the stresses make this\nphenomenon controllable and therefore applicable to modify macroscopic\nproperties of soft condensed matter phases\n", "  The critical behaviour in short time dynamics for the q=6 and 7 state Potts\nmodels in two-dimensions is investigated. It is shown that dynamic finite-size\nscaling exists for first-order phase transitions.\n", "  A model kinetic equation is solved exactly for a special stationary state\ndescribing nonlinear Couette flow in a low density system of inelastic spheres.\nThe hydrodynamic fields, heat and momentum fluxes, and the phase space\ndistribution function are determined explicitly. The results apply for\nconditions such that viscous heating dominates collisional cooling, including\nlarge gradients far from the reference homogeneous cooling state. Explicit\nexpressions for the generalized transport coefficients (e.g., viscosity and\nthermal conductivity) are obtained as nonlinear functions of the coefficient of\nnormal restitution and the shear rate.These exact results for the model kinetic\nequation are also shown to be good approximations to the corresponding state\nfor the Boltzmann equation via comparison with direct Monte Carlo simulation\nfor the latter\n", "  A two-dimensional (2D) assembly of noninteracting, temperature-dependent,\ncomposite-boson Cooper pairs (CPs) in chemical and thermal equilibrium with\nunpaired fermions is examined in a binary boson-fermion statistical model as\nthe superconducting singularity temperature is approached from above. The model\nis derived from {\\it first principles} for the BCS model interfermion\ninteraction from three extrema of the system Helmholtz free energy (subject to\nconstant pairable-fermion number) with respect to: a) the pairable-fermion\ndistribution function; b) the number of excited (bosonic) CPs, i.e., with\nnonzero total momenta--usually ignored in BCS theory--and with the appropriate\n(linear, as opposed to quadratic) dispersion relation that arises from the\nFermi sea; and c) the number of CPs with zero total momenta. Compared with the\nBCS theory condensate, higher singularity temperatures for the Bose-Einstein\ncondensate are obtained in the binary boson-fermion mixture model which are in\nrough agreement with empirical critical temperatures for quasi-2D\nsuperconductors\n", "  We have performed high-resolution measurements of the magnetic field (0~T~$\n\\le B \\le 9~$T) and temperature (10 K~$\\le T < 140~$K) dependence of the\nlongitudinal and transverse Hall thermal conductivity of a twinned\nYBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6.95}$ single crystal. We have used and compared two\nrecently published methods to extract the thermal Hall angle $\\theta_H(T,B)$.\nOur results indicate that $\\cot(\\theta_H)$ varies quite accurately as $T^4$ in\nthe intermediate temperature range $\\sim 0.3 < T/T_c$. It shows a well defined\nminimum at $T_m \\simeq 20~$K which resembles that observed in the $c$-axis\nmicrowave conductivity. The electronic part of the longitudinal and the\ntransverse thermal conductivity show the scaling behavior for transport\nproperties predicted for d-wave superconductors in the temperature range $\\sim\n18~$K~$\\le T \\le 30~$K.\n", "  Cooper pairing in two dimensions is analyzed with a set of renormalized\nequations to determine its binding energy for any fermion number density and\nall coupling assuming a generic pairwise residual interfermion interaction. \\\nAlso considered are Cooper pairs (CPs) with nonzero center-of-mass momentum\n(CMM)--usually neglected in BCS theory--and their binding energy is expanded\nanalytically in powers of the CMM up to quadratic terms. A Fermi-sea-dependent\n{\\it linear} term in the CMM dominates the pair excitation energy in weak\ncoupling (also called the BCS regime) while the more familiar quadratic term\nprevails in strong coupling (the Bose regime). The crossover, though strictly\nunrelated to BCS theory {\\it per se,} is studied numerically as it is expected\nto play a central role in a model of superconductivity as a Bose-Einstein\ncondensation of CPs where the transition temperature vanishes for all\ndimensionality $d\\leq 2$ for quadratic dispersion, but is {\\it nonzero} for all\n$d\\geq 1$ for linear dispersion.\n", "  Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in two dimensions (2D) (e.g., to describe\nthe quasi-2D cuprates) is suggested as the possible mechanism widely believed\nto underlie superconductivity in general. A crucial role is played by nonzero\ncenter-of-mass momentum Cooper pairs (CPs) usually neglected in BCS theory.\nAlso vital is the unique {\\it linear} dispersion relation appropriate to\nweakly-coupled \"bosonic\" CPs moving in the Fermi sea--rather than in vacuum\nwhere the dispersion would be quadratic but only for very strong coupling, and\nfor which BEC is known to be impossible in 2D.\n", "  Coherent backscattering (CBS) of light waves by a random medium is a\nsignature of interference effects in multiple scattering. This effect has been\nstudied in many systems ranging from white paint to biological tissues.\nRecently, we have observed CBS from a sample of laser-cooled atoms, a\nscattering medium with interesting new properties. In this paper we discuss\nvarious effects, which have to be taken into account for a quantitative study\nof coherent backscattering of light by cold atoms.\n", "  We use conducting-tip atomic force microscopy (AFM) to measure local\nelectronic properties of single wall carbon nanotube (SWNT) circuits on\ninsulating substrates. When a voltage is applied to the tip and AFM feedback is\nused to position the tip, images formed from the tip-sample tunnel current have\nsingle tube resolution (near 1 nm diameter), more than an order of magnitude\nbetter than simultaneously acquired topographic AFM images. By finding points\nwhere the tip-sample current is zero, it is possible to measure the\nelectrochemical potential within the circuit, again with nanometer resolution.\nSuch measurements provide compelling evidence that nanotubes within a bundle\nhave only weak electronic coupling. Finally the AFM tip is used as a local\nelectrostatic gate, and the gating action can be correlated with the structure\nof the SWNT bundle sample. This technique should be useful for a broad range of\ncircuits containing SWNTs and other molecules.\n", "  The peculiar phase-ordering properties of a lattice of coupled chaotic maps\nstudied recently (A. Lema\\^\\i tre & H. Chat\\'e, {\\em Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\\bf\n82}, 1140 (1999)) are revisited with the help of detailed investigations of\ninterface motion. It is shown that ``normal'', curvature-driven-like domain\ngrowth is recovered at larger scales than considered before, and that the\npersistence exponent seems to be universal. Using generalized persistence\nspectra, the properties of interface motion in this deterministic, chaotic,\nlattice system are found to ``interpolate'' between those of the two canonical\nreference systems, the (probabilistic) Ising model, and the (deterministic),\nspace-continuous, time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation.\n", "  7Li NMR measurements were performed in the metallic spinel LiV2O4. The\ntemperature dependencies of the line width, the Knight shift and the\nspin-lattice relaxation rate were investigated in the temperature range 30 mK <\nT < 280 K. For temperatures T < 1 K we observe a spin-lattice relaxation rate\nwhich slows down exponentially. The NMR results can be explained by a\nspin-liquid behavior and the opening of a spin gap of the order 0.6 K.\n", "  We report the results of experiments with Bose-Einstein condensates of\nrubidium atoms in a triaxial TOP-trap, presenting measurements of the\ncondensate fraction and the free expansion of a condensate released from the\ntrap. The experimental apparatus and the methods used to calibrate the magnetic\ntrapping fields are discussed in detail. Furthermore, we compare the\nperformance of our apparatus with other TOP-traps and discuss possible limiting\nfactors for the sizes of condensates achievable in such traps.\n", "  We present an application of Wertheim's Thermodynamic Perturbation Theory\n(TPT1) to a simple coarse grained model made of flexibly bonded Lennard-Jones\nmonomers. We use both the Reference Hyper-Netted-Chain (RHNC) and Mean\nSpherical approximation (MSA) integral equation theories to describe the\nproperties of the reference fluid. The equation of state, the density\ndependence of the excess chemical potential, and the critical points of the\nliquid--vapor transition are compared with simulation results and good\nagreement is found. The RHNC version is somewhat more accurate, while the MSA\nversion has the advantage of being almost analytic. We analyze the scaling\nbehavior of the critical point of chain fluids according to TPT1 and find it to\nreproduce the mean field exponents: The critical monomer density is predicted\nto vanish as $n^{-1/2}$ upon increasing the chain length $n$ while the critical\ntemperature is predicted to reach an asymptotic finite temperature that is\nattained as $n^{-1/2}$. The predicted asymptotic finite critical temperature\nobtained from the RHNC and MSA versions of TPT1 is found to be in good\nagreement with the $\\Theta$ point of our polymer model as obtained from the\ntemperature dependence of the single chain conformations.\n", "  For ferrofluids that are described by a system of hard spheres interacting\nvia dipolar forces we evaluate the magnetization as a function of the internal\nmagnetic field with a Born--Mayer technique and an expansion in the dipolar\ncoupling strength. Two different approximations are presented for the\nmagnetization considering different contributions to a series expansion in\nterms of the volume fraction of the particles and the dipolar coupling\nstrength.\n", "  The reorientation dynamics of local tangent vectors of chains in isotropic\namorphous melts containing semiflexible model polymers was studied by molecular\ndynamics simulations. The reorientation is strongly influenced both by the\nlocal chain stiffness and by the overall chain length. It takes place by two\ndifferent subsequent processes: A short-time non-exponential decay and a\nlong-time exponential reorientation arising from the relaxation of medium-size\nchain segments. Both processes depend on stiffness and chain length. The strong\ninfluence of the chain length on the chain dynamics is in marked contrast to\nits negligible effect on the static structure of the melt. The local structure\nshows only a small dependence on the stiffness, and is independent of chain\nlength. Calculated correlation functions related to double-quantum NMR\nexperiments are in qualitative agreement with experiments on entangled melts. A\nplateau is observed in the dependence of segment reorientation on the\nmean-squared displacement of the corresponding chain segments. This plateau\nconfirms, on one hand, the existence of reptation dynamics. On the other hand,\nit shows how the reptation picture has to be adapted if, instead of fully\nflexible chains, semirigid chains are considered.\n", "  The Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook kinetic model of the Boltzmann equation is solved\nfor the steady cylindrical Poiseuille flow fed by a constant gravity field. The\nsolution is obtained as a perturbation expansion in powers of the field\n(through fourth order) and for a general class of repulsive potentials. The\nresults, which are hardly sensitive to the interaction potential, suggest that\nthe expansion is only asymptotic. A critical comparison with the profiles\npredicted by the Navier-Stokes equations shows that the latter fail over\ndistances comparable to the mean free path. In particular, while the\nNavier-Stokes description predicts a monotonically decreasing temperature as\none moves apart from the cylinder axis, the kinetic theory description shows\nthat the temperature has a local minimum at the axis and reaches a maximum\nvalue at a distance of the order of the mean free path. Within that distance,\nthe radial heat flows from the colder to the hotter points, in contrast to what\nis expected from the Fourier law. Furthermore, a longitudinal component of the\nheat flux exists in the absence of gradients along the longitudinal direction.\nNon-Newtonian effects, such as a non uniform hydrostatic pressure and normal\nstress differences, are also present.\n", "  We study the thermal transport properties in three-dimensional disordered\nsystems close to the metal-insulator transition within linear response. Using a\nsuitable form for the energy-dependent conductivity $\\sigma$, we show that the\nvalue of the dynamical scaling exponent for noninteracting disordered systems\nsuch as the Anderson model of localization can be reproduced. Furthermore, the\nvalues of the thermopower S have the right order of magnitude close to the\ntransition as compared to the experimental results. A sign change in the\nthermoelectric power S - as is often observed in experiments - can also be\nmodeled within the linear response formulation using modified experimental\n$\\sigma$ data as input.\n", "  We present a numerical method for the investigation of non-ergodic effects in\nthe Coulomb glass. For that, an almost complete set of low-energy many-particle\nstates is obtained by a new algorithm. The dynamics of the sample is mapped to\nthe graph formed by the relevant transitions between these states, that means\nby transitions with rates larger than the inverse of the duration of the\nmeasurement. The formation of isolated clusters in the graph indicates\nnon-ergodicity. We analyze the connectivity of this graph in dependence on\ntemperature, duration of measurement, degree of disorder, and dimensionality,\nstudying how non-ergodicity is reflected in the specific heat.\n", "  The relaxation of the specific heat and the entropy to their equilibrium\nvalues is investigated numerically for the three-dimensional Coulomb glass at\nvery low temperatures. The long time relaxation follows a stretched exponential\nfunction, $f(t)=f_0\\exp[-(t/\\tau)^\\beta]$, with the exponent $\\beta$ increasing\nwith the temperature. The relaxation time follows an Arrhenius behavior\ndivergence when $T\\to 0$. A relation between the specific heat and the entropy\nin the long time regime is found.\n", "  We establish the equivalence of a recently introduced discrete model of the\nhydrophobic interaction, as well as its extension to continuous state\nvariables, with the Ising model in a magnetic field with temperature-dependent\nstrength. In order to capture the effect of symmetries of the solvent particles\nwe introduce a generalized multi-state model. We solve this model - which is\nnot of the Ising type - exactly in one dimension. Our findings suggest that a\nsmall increase in symmetry decreases the amplitude of the solvent-mediated part\nof the potential of mean force between solute particles and enhances the\nsolubility in a very simple fashion. High symmetry decreases also the range of\nthe attractive potential. This weakening of the hydrophobic effect observed in\nthe model is in agreement with the notion that the effect is entropic in\norigin.\n", "  We have used particle tracking methods to study the dynamics of individual\nballs comprising a granular flow in a small-angle two-dimensional funnel. We\nstatistically analyze many ball trajectories to examine the mechanisms of shock\npropagation. In particular, we study the creation of, and interactions between,\nshock waves. We also investigate the role of granular temperature and draw\nparallels to traffic flow dynamics.\n", "  We present a weak-relativistic limit comparison between the Kohn-Sham-Dirac\nequation and its approximate form containing the exchange coupling, which is\nused in almost all relativistic codes of density-functional theory. For these\ntwo descriptions, an exact expression of the Dirac Green's function in terms of\nthe non-relativistic Green's function is first derived and then used to\ncalculate the effective Hamiltonian, i.e., Pauli Hamiltonian, and effective\nvelocity operator in the weak-relativistic limit. We point out that, besides\nneglecting orbital magnetism effects, the approximate Kohn-Sham-Dirac equation\nalso gives relativistic corrections which differ from those of the exact\nKohn-Sham-Dirac equation. These differences have quite serious consequences: in\nparticular, the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of an uniaxial ferromagnet and\nthe anisotropic magnetoresistance of a cubic ferromagnet are found from the\napproximate Kohn-Sham-Dirac equation to be of order $1/c^2$, whereas the\ncorrect results obtained from the exact Kohn-Sham-Dirac equation are of order\n$1/c^4$ . We give a qualitative estimate of the order of magnitude of these\nspurious terms.\n", "  Ag/Fe/Ag and Cr/Fe/Cr trilayers with a single $25 nm$ thick ferromagnetic\nlayer exhibit giant magnetoresistance (GMR) type behavior. The resistance\ndecreases for parallel and transversal magnetic field alignements with a\nLangevin-type magnetic field dependence up to B=12 T. The phenomenon is\nexplained by a granular interface structure. Results on Fe/Ag multilayers are\nalso interpreted in terms of a granular interface magnetoresistance.\n", "  We present an experiment which aim is to investigate the mechanical\nproperties of a static granular assembly. The piling is an horizontal 3D\ngranular layer confined in a box, we apply a localized extra force at the\nsurface and the spatial distribution of stresses at the bottom is obtained (the\nmechanical Green's function). For different types of granular media, we observe\na linear pressure response which profile shows one peak centered at the\nvertical of the point of application. The peak's width increases linearly when\nincreasing the depth. This green function seems to be in -at least- qualitative\nagreement with predictions of elastic theory.\n", "  Background charge rearrangements in metallic single-electron transistors are\nmodelled in two-level tunnelling systems as a Poisson process with a scale\nparameter as only variable. The model explains the recent observation of\nasymmetric Coulomb blockade peak spacing distributions in metallic\nsingle-electron transistors. From the scale parameter we estimate the average\nsize of the tunnelling systems, their density of states, and the height of\ntheir energy barrier. We conclude that the observed background charge\nrearrangements predominantly take place in the substrate of the single-electron\ntransistor.\n", "  Elastic and inelastic neutron scattering were used to study the ordered phase\nof the quasi-one-dimensional spin-1/2 antiferromagnet ${\\rm\nBaCu_{2}Si_{2}O_{7}}$. The previously proposed model for the low-temperature\nmagnetic structure was confirmed. Spin wave dispersion along several\nreciprocal-space directions was measured and inter-chain, as well as in-chain\nexchange constants were determined. A small gap in the spin wave spectrum was\nobserved and attributed to magnetic anisotropy effects. The results are\ndiscussed in comparison with existing theories for weakly-coupled quantum spin\nchain antiferromagnets.\n", "  Using Landau-de Gennes effective theory for nematic liquid crystals we\nanalyse the structure of rectilinear n=1/2 smooth disclination line in the case\nof equal elastic constants. We find that at certain temperature there is an\nexact mathematical correspondence with a rectilinear vortex in superfluid\n$^4He$. With a help of polynomial approximation difference of free energies of\nthe smooth and of a singular disclination lines is estimated. It turns out that\nthe smooth disclination line is energetically preferred only if temperature is\nlow enough. At higher temperatures a disordered core should be expected.\n", "  It is shown that the Lorentz invariant temperature $T^\\prime=T$ and entropy\n$S^\\prime=\\gamma S$, pressure ${\\cal P}^\\prime = \\gamma^2 {\\cal P}$, volume\n${\\cal V}^\\prime ={\\cal V}/\\gamma$, and energy $U^\\prime = \\gamma U$, where\n$\\gamma = (1-V^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$, are the correct transformational properties of\nthe thermodynamical quantities of the relativistic ideal gas.\n", "  It is shown that the usual identification of certain averages with the\nrelativistic thermodynamical functions is not possible in the moving reference\nframe description. The Brownian motion approach is used as the Markovian\nkinetic description of the relativistic ideal gas system.\n", "  The relativistic generalization of a free Brownian motion theory is\npresented. The global characteristics of the relaxation are {\\it explicitly}\nfound for the velocity and momentum (stochastic) kinetics. It is shown that the\nthermal corrections, to the both relaxation times $T$ (of stationary\nautocorrelations) and transient relaxation time of momentum, appear slowing\ndown the processes. The transient relaxation time of the velocity does not\ndepend {\\it explicitly} on temperature, $T(v_0)= m(v_0)/\\gamma \\equiv\n\\epsilon_0/\\gamma c^2$, and it is proportional to the initial energy of a\nrelativistic Brownian particle.\n", "  The reflectance difference (RD) as a function of film thickness was measured\nduring Pb deposition on Si(111)-(6x6)Au surface at 105 K. The oblique incident\ns- and p-polarized light with energy range 0.25-0.60 eV was used. The component\nof the dielectric function tensor parallel to the surface was determined from\nthe data of experiments and it oscillation due to quantum size effects (QSE)\nwith period of 2 ML within the Pb monolayer-by-monolayer growth was observed.\n", "  We survey the various uses of singular gauge fields which render an ideal\ndescription of ensembles of line- and surface-like excitations and explain\nphase transitions with the help of simple quadratic actions. Near a transition,\nthe singular gauge fields can be transformed into ordinary complex fields\ncalled disorder fields which differ from Landau's order fields by developing a\nnonzero expectation value in the high-temperature phase.\n", "  Single-charge tunneling in ultrasmall voltage biased SIS junctions in a\nhigh-impedance electromagnetic environment is considered. The Cooper pair\ncurrent is calculated at T=0 on the basis of the elementary tunnel Hamiltonian\nfor quasiparticles. Therefore, the transfer of Cooper pairs emerges\nautomatically as an effect of higher order perturbation theory. The\nsupercurrent also depends on the dissipative part of the Josephson current\namplitude.\n", "  Fokker-Planck equations have been applied in the past to field theory topics\nsuch as the stochastic quantization and the stabilization of bottomless action\ntheories. In this paper we give another application of the FP-techniques in a\nway appropriate to the study of the ground state, the excited states and the\ncritical behaviour of quantum lattice Hamiltonians. With this purpose, we start\nby considering a discrete or lattice version of the standard FP-Hamiltonian.\nThe well known exponential ansatz for the ground state wave functional becomes\nin our case an exponential ``cluster\" expansion. With a convenient choice for\nthis latter, we are able to construct FP-Hamiltonians which to a large extent\nreproduce critical properties of ``realistic\" quantum lattice Hamiltonians, as\nthe one of the Ising model in a transverse field (ITF). In one dimension, this\nstatement is made manifest by proving that the FP-Hamiltonian we built up\nbelongs to the same universality class as the standard ITF model or,\nequivalently, the 2D-classical Ising model. To this respect, some\nconsiderations concerning higher dimensional ITF models are outlined.\n", "  This paper considers a Josephson Junction array with the geometry of a ladder\nand anisotropy in the Josephson couplings. The ground state problem for the\nladder corresponds to the one for the one-dimensional chiral XY model in a\ntwo-fold anisotropy field, which allows of a rigorous characterization of the\nground state phase diagram and the relevant elementary excitations for the\nsystem. The approach to equilibrium, which we study using Langevin dynamics,\nshows slow relaxation, typical of systems whose energy landscape in the\nconfiguration space consists of a wealthy of metastable states, dynamically\ndisconnected.\n", "  We investigate the sandpile model on the two--dimensional Sierpinski gasket\nfractal. We find that the model displays novel critical behavior, and we\nanalyze the distribution functions of avalanche sizes, lifetimes and topplings\nand calculate the associated critical exponents $\\tau = 1.51 \\pm 0.04$, $\\alpha\n= 1.63 \\pm 0.04$ and $\\mu = 1.36 \\pm 0.04$. The avalanche size distribution\nshows power law behavior modulated by logarithmic oscillations which can be\nrelated to the discrete scale invariance of the underlying lattice. Such a\ndistribution can be formally described by introducing a complex scaling\nexponent ${\\tau}^{*} \\equiv \\tau + i \\delta$, where the real part $\\tau$\ncorresponds to the power law and the imaginary part $\\delta$ is related to the\nperiod of the logarithmic oscillations.\n", "  We study the nonlinear transport properties of NS (normal-superconductor) and\nNSN structures by means of a self-consistent microscopic description. A nonzero\nsuperfluid velocity causes the various quasiparticle channels within S to open\nat different voltages. The gap reduction is very sensitive to the details of\nquasiparticle scattering. At low temperatures, superconductivity, some times in\na peculiar gapless form, may survive up to voltages much higher that $k_B\nT_c/e$. The minimum voltage for quasiparticle transmission is shown to decrease\nstrongly with temperature and with the transmittivity of the barrier.\n", "  The exact expression for the phase-dependent linear conductance of a weakly\ndamped superconducting quantum point contact is obtained. The calculation is\nperformed by summing up the complete perturbative series in the coupling\nbetween the electrodes. The failure of any finite order perturbative expansion\nin the limit of small voltage and small quasi-particle damping is analyzed in\ndetail. In the low transmission regime this nonperturbative calculation yields\na result which is at variance with standard tunnel theory. Our result predicts\nthe correct sign of the quasi-particle pair interference term and exhibits an\nunusual phase-dependence at low temperatures in qualitative agreement with the\navailable experimental data.\n", "  We consider concentric circular defects in the two-dimensional Ising model,\nwhich are distributed according to a generalized Fredholm sequence, i. e. at\nexponentially increasing radii. This type of aperiodicity does not change the\nbulk critical behaviour but introduces a marginal extended perturbation. The\ncritical exponent of the local magnetization is obtained through finite-size\nscaling, using a corner transfer matrix approach in the extreme anisotropic\nlimit. It varies continuously with the amplitude of the modulation and is\nclosely related to the magnetic exponent of the radial Hilhorst-van Leeuwen\nmodel. Through a conformal mapping of the system onto a strip, the gap-exponent\nrelation is shown to remain valid for such an aperiodic defect.\n", "  We introduce a model of two coupled reaction-diffusion equations to describe\nthe dynamics and propagation of flame fronts in random media. The model\nincorporates heat diffusion, its dissipation, and its production through\ncoupling to the background reactant density. We first show analytically and\nnumerically that there is a finite critical value of the background density,\nbelow which the front associated with the temperature field stops propagating.\nThe critical exponents associated with this transition are shown to be\nconsistent with mean field theory of percolation. Second, we study the kinetic\nroughening associated with a moving planar flame front above the critical\ndensity. By numerically calculating the time dependent width and equal time\nheight correlation function of the front, we demonstrate that the roughening\nprocess belongs to the universality class of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang interface\nequation. Finally, we show how this interface equation can be analytically\nderived from our model in the limit of almost uniform background density.\n", "  The su(1$|$1) symmetric version of the Haldane-Shastry spin chain is\ndiagonalized by means of a linear transformation. The same transformation\napplied to the original su(2) model yields simple expressions for the\nHamiltonian and the generators of the Yangian symmetry of the model in terms of\nspin wave operators.\n", "  A combination of analytical approaches and quantum Monte Carlo simulations is\nused to study both magnetic and pairing correlations for a version of the\nHubbard model that includes second-neighbor hopping $t^{\\prime }=-0.35t$ as a\nmodel for high-temperature superconductors. Magnetic properties are analyzed\nusing the Two-Particle Self-Consistent approach. The maximum in magnetic\nsusceptibility as a function of doping appears both at finite $% t^{\\prime }$\nand at $t^{\\prime }=0$ but for two totally different physical reasons. When\n$t^{\\prime }=0$, it is induced by antiferromagnetic correlations while at\n$t^{\\prime }=-0.35t$ it is a band structure effect amplified by interactions.\nFinally, pairing fluctuations are compared with $% T $-matrix results to\ndisentangle the effects of van Hove singularity and of nesting on\nsuperconducting correlations. The addition of antiferromagnetic fluctuations\nincreases slightly the $d$-wave superconducting correlations despite the\npresence of a van Hove singularity which tends to decrease them in the\nrepulsive model. Some aspects of the phase diagram and some subtleties of\nfinite-size scaling in Monte Carlo simulations, such as inverted finite-size\ndependence, are also discussed.\n", "  We show that in a ring-shaped Luttinger Liquid (LL) in contact with an\nelectron reservoir --- the chemical potential in the ring being controlled by a\ngate voltage $V_g$ --- both the average ring charge and the persistent current\nin the ring are step-like functions of $V_g$ at low temperatures. The step\npositions are determined by the LL parameter $\\alpha=v_F/s$, which therefore\ncan be directly measured. We study electrons both with and without spin, taking\ninto account long-range interactions in the ring.\n", "  We study disordered Josephson junctions arrays with long-range interaction\nand charging effects. The model consists of two orthogonal sets of positionally\ndisordered $N$ parallel filaments (or wires) Josephson coupled at each crossing\nand in the presence of a homogeneous and transverse magnetic field. The large\ncharging energy (resulting from small self-capacitance of the ultrathin wires)\nintroduces important quantum fluctuations of the superconducting phase within\neach filament. Positional disorder and magnetic field frustration induce\nspin-glass like ground state, characterized by not having long-range order of\nthe phases. The stability of this phase is destroyed for sufficiently large\ncharging energy. We have evaluated the temperature vs charging energy phase\ndiagram by extending the methods developed in the theory of infinite-range spin\nglasses, in the limit of large magnetic field. The phase diagram in the\ndifferent temperature regimes is evaluated by using variety of methods, to wit:\nsemiclassical WKB and variational methods, Rayleigh-Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nperturbation theory and pseudospin effective Hamiltonians. Possible\nexperimental consequences of these results are briefly discussed.\n", "  We solve exactly a generalized Hubbard ring with twisted boundary conditions.\nThe magnitude of the nearest-neighbor hopping depends on the occupations of the\nsites involved and the term which modifies the number of doubly occupied sites\n$t_{AB}=0$. Although $\\eta$-pairing states with off-diagonal long-range order\nare part of the degenerate ground state, the behavior of the energy as a\nfunction of the twist rules out superconductivity in this limit. A small\n$t_{AB}$ breaks the degeneracy and for moderate repulsive $U$ introduce\nsuperconducting correlations which lead to ``anomalous'' flux quantization.\n  PACS numbers: 74.20Mn, 71.27.+a, 71.30+h, 71.28.+d\n", "  We consider the deterministic model with glassy behaviour, recently\nintroduced by Marinari, Parisi and Ritort, with \\ha\\ $H=\\sum_{i,j=1}^N\nJ_{i,j}\\sigma_i\\sigma_j$, where $J$ is the discrete sine Fourier transform. The\nground state found by these authors for $N$ odd and $2N+1$ prime is shown to\nbecome asymptotically dege\\-ne\\-ra\\-te when $2N+1$ is a product of odd primes,\nand to disappear for $N$ even. This last result is based on the explicit\nconstruction of a set of eigenvectors for $J$, obtained through its formal\nidentity with the imaginary part of the propagator of the quantized unit\nsymplectic matrix over the $2$-torus.\n", "  We study the conservation laws of both the classical and the quantum\nmechanical continuum $1/r^2$ type systems. For the classical case, we introduce\nnew integrals of motion along the recent ideas of Shastry and Sutherland (SS),\nsupplementing the usual integrals of motion constructed much earlier by Moser.\nWe show by explicit construction that one set of integrals can be related\nalgebraically to the other. The difference of these two sets of integrals then\ngives rise to yet another complete set of integrals of motion. For the quantum\ncase, we first need to resum the integrals proposed by Calogero, Marchioro and\nRagnisco. We give a diagrammatic construction scheme for these new integrals,\nwhich are the quantum analogues of the classical traces. Again we show that\nthere is a relationship between these new integrals and the quantum integrals\nof SS by explicit construction.\n", "  We study interacting one dimensional (1D) quantum lattice gases with\nintegrable impurities. These model Hamiltonians can be derived using the\nquantum inverse scattering method for inhomogeneous models and are by\nconstruction integrable. Absence of backscattering at the impurities is shown\nto be the characteristic feature of these disordered systems. The value of the\neffective carrier charge and the Sutherland-Shastry relation are derived for\nthe half-filled XXX model and are shown to be independent of the impurity\nconcentration and strength. For the half-filled XXZ model we show that there is\nno enhancement of the persistent currents for repulsive interactions. For\nattractive interactions we identify a crossover regime beyond which enhancement\nof the currents is observed.\n", "  We introduce a novel variance-reducing Monte Carlo algorithm for accurate\ndetermination of autocorrelation times. We apply this method to two-dimensional\nIsing systems with sizes up to $15 \\times 15$, using single-spin flip dynamics,\nrandom site selection and transition probabilities according to the heat-bath\nmethod. From a finite-size scaling analysis of these autocorrelation times, the\ndynamical critical exponent $z$ is determined as $z=2.1665$ (12).\n", "  We study the electronic excitations near the charge-transfer gap in\ninsulating CuO$_2$ planes, starting from a six-band model which includes $%\np_\\pi $ and $d_{xy}$ orbitals and Cu-O nearest-neighbor repulsion $U_{pd}$.\nWhile the low lying electronic excitations in the doped system are well\ndescribed by a modified $t-J$ model, the excitonic states of the insulator\ninclude hybrid $d_{xy}-$ $p_\\pi $ states of $A_{2g}$ symmetry. We also obtain\nexcitons of symmetries $B_{1g}$ and $E_u$, and eventually $A_{1g}$, which can\nbe explained within a one-band model. The results agree with observed optical\nabsorption and Raman excitations.\n", "  Lattice models of coupled dynamical systems lead to a variety of complex\nbehaviors. Between the individual motion of independent units and the\ncollective behavior of members of a population evolving synchronously, there\nexist more complicated attractors. In some cases, these states are identified\nwith self-organized critical phenomena. In other situations, with\nclusterization or phase-locking. The conditions leading to such different\nbehaviors in models of integrate-and-fire oscillators and stick-slip processes\nare reviewed.\n", "  We study the Cu-O valence instability (VI) and the related phase separation\n(PS) driven by Cu-O nearest-neighbor repulsion $U_{pd}$, using an effective\nextended one-band Hubbard model ($H_{eff}$) obtained from the extended\nthree-bandHubbard model, through an appropriate low-energy reduction. $H_{eff}$\nis solved by exact diagonalization of a square cluster with 10 unit cells and\nalso within a slave-boson mean-field theory. Its parameters depend on doping\nfor $U_{pd}\\neq 0$ or on-site O repulsion $U_p\\neq 0$. The results using both\ntechniques coincide in that there is neither VI nor PS for doping levels\n$x<0.5$ if $U_{pd}\\lesssim 2$ eV. The PS region begins for $U_{pd}\\gtrsim 2$ eV\nat large doping $x>0.6$ and increases with increasing $U_{pd}$. The PS also\nincreases with increasing on-site Cu repulsion $U_d$.\n", "  The Aharonov-Bohm effect in a one-dimensional (1D) ring containing a gas of\nfractionally charged excitations is considered. It is shown that the low\ntemperature behavior of the system is identical to that of free electrons with\n(integer) charge $e$. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the total\ncharge in the ring is quantized in units of the electron charge. Anomalous\noscillations of the persistent current amplitude with temperature are predicted\nto occur as a direct manifistation of the fractional nature of the\nquasiparticle charge. A 1D conducting ring with gate induced periodical\npotential is discussed as a possible set-up for an experimental observation of\nthe predicted phenomenon.\n", "  Several recent experiments find evidence of superfluidity of 3He in\n98%-porous aerogel. The primary effect of the aerogel is that it scatters the\nquasiparticles of 3He. We find that many experimental findings are\nquantitatively understood by a relatively simple model that takes into account\nstrong inhomogeneity of the scattering on a length scale of 100 nm.\n", "  We review the assumptions on which the Monte Carlo renormalization technique\nis based, in particular the analyticity of the block spin transformations. On\nthis basis, we select an optimized Kadanoff blocking rule in combination with\nthe simulation of a d=3 Ising model with reduced corrections to scaling. This\nis achieved by including interactions with second and third neighbors. As a\nconsequence of the improved analyticity properties, this Monte Carlo\nrenormalization method yields a fast convergence and a high accuracy. The\nresults for the critical exponents are y_H=2.481(1) and y_T=1.585(3).\n", "  We have studied experimentally transport properties in a slowly driven\ngranular system which recently was shown to display self-organized criticality\n[Frette {\\em et al., Nature} {\\bf 379}, 49 (1996)]. Tracer particles were added\nto a pile and their transit times measured. The distribution of transit times\nis a constant with a crossover to a decaying power law. The average transport\nvelocity decreases with system size. This is due to an increase in the active\nzone depth with system size. The relaxation processes generate coherently\nmoving regions of grains mixed with convection. This picture is supported by\nconsidering transport in a $1D$ cellular automaton modeling the experiment.\n", "  The crossover from two- to three-dimensional critical behavior of nearly\nantiferromagnetic itinerant electrons is studied in a regime where the\ninter-plane single-particle motion of electrons is quantum-mechanically\nincoherent because of thermal fluctuations. This is a relevant regime for very\nanisotropic materials like the cuprates. The problem is studied within the\nTwo-Particle Self-Consistent approach (TPSC), that has been previously shown to\ngive a quantitative description of Monte Carlo data for the Hubbard model. It\nis shown that TPSC belongs to the $n\\rightarrow \\infty $ limit of the $O\\left(\nn\\right) $ universality class. However, contrary to the usual approaches,\ncutoffs appear naturally in the microscopic TPSC theory so that parameter-free\ncalculations can be done for Hubbard models with arbitrary band structure. A\ngeneral discussion of universality in the renormalized-classical crossover from\n$d=2$ to $d=3$ is also given.\n", "  The ``orthodox theory'' of a single electron double junction is dealt with.\nIt is shown that the stationary solution of the underlying master equation\nallows the construction of any time-dependent solution in terms of orthogonal\npolynomials. The approach pays off if the stationary solution becomes simple.\nTwo special cases are considered. We use the time-dependent solution to\ncalculate the current noise in these cases.\n", "  Persistent currents in mesoscopic metallic rings induced by static magnetic\nfields are investigated by means of a Hamiltonian which incorporates diagonal\ndisorder and the electron-electron interaction through a Hubbard term ($U$).\nCorrelations are included up to second order perturbation theory which is shown\nto work accurately for $U$ of the order of the hopping integral. If disorder is\nnot very strong, interactions increase the current up to near its value for a\nclean metal. Averaging over ring lengths eliminates the first Fourier component\nof the current and reduces its value, which remains low after interactions are\nincluded.\n", "  We contrast analytical results of a variety of growth models involving\nsubdiffusion, thermal noise and quenched disorder with simulations of these\nmodels, concluding that the assumed self-affinity property is more an exception\nthan a rule. In our two dimensional models, self-affine surfaces may only\nappear when the roughness exponent is $\\chi = 1/2$ or $\\chi = 1$. A new scaling\npicture, which leads to more suitable ways of determining the scaling\nexponents, is proposed when lack of self-affinity exists.\n", "  The influence of non-magnetic impurities on the spectrum and dynamical spin\nstructure factor of a model for CuGeO$_3$ is studied. A simple extension to\nZn-doped ${\\rm Sr Cu_2 O_3}$ is also discussed. Using Exact Diagonalization\ntechniques and intuitive arguments we show that Zn-doping introduces states in\nthe Spin-Peierls gap of CuGeO$_3$. This effect can beunderstood easily in the\nlarge dimerization limit where doping by Zn creates ``loose'' S=1/2 spins,\nwhich interact with each other through very weak effective antiferromagnetic\ncouplings. When the dimerization is small, a similar effect is observed but now\nwith the free S=1/2 spins being the resulting S=1/2 ground state of severed\nchains with an odd number of sites. Experimental consequences of these results\nare discussed. It is interesting to observe that the spin correlations along\nthe chains are enhanced by Zn-doping according to the numerical data presented\nhere. As recent numerical calculations have shown, similar arguments apply to\nladders with non-magnetic impurities simply replacing the tendency to\ndimerization in CuGeO$_3$ by the tendency to form spin-singlets along the rungs\nin SrCu$_2$O$_3$.\n", "  A Potts feedback neural network approach for finding good solutions to\nresource allocation problems with a non-fixed topology is presented. As a\ntarget application the airline crew scheduling problem is chosen. The\ntopological complication is handled by means of a propagator defined in terms\nof Potts neurons. The approach is tested on artificial random problems tuned to\nresemble real-world conditions. Very good results are obtained for a variety of\nproblem sizes. The computer time demand for the approach only grows like\n$\\mbox{(number of flights)}^3$. A realistic problem typically is solved within\nminutes, partly due to a prior reduction of the problem size, based on an\nanalysis of the local arrival/departure structure at the single airports\n", "  We propose a new calculation of the DC conductance of a 1-dimensional\nelectron system described by the Luttinger model. Our approach is based on the\nideas of Landauer and B\\\"{u}ttiker and on the methods of current algebra. We\nanalyse in detail the way in which the system can be coupled to external\nreservoirs. This determines whether the conductance is renormalized or not. We\nshow that although a quantum wire and a Fractional Quantum Hall system are\ndescribed by the same effective theory, their coupling to external reservoirs\nis different. As a consequence, the conductance in the wire is quantized in\ninteger units of $e^2/h$ per spin orientation whereas the Hall conductance\nallows for fractional quantization.\n", "  We present a class of systems for which the signal-to-noise ratio always\nincreases when increasing the noise and diverges at infinite noise level. This\nnew phenomenon is a direct consequence of the existence of a scaling law for\nthe signal-to-noise ratio and implies the appearance of stochastic resonance in\nsome monostable systems. We outline applications of our results to a wide\nvariety of systems pertaining to different scientific areas. Two particular\nexamples are discussed in detail.\n", "  We show that the dipole, a system usually proposed to model relaxation\nphenomena, exhibits a maximum in the signal-to-noise ratio at a non-zero noise\nlevel, thus indicating the appearance of stochastic resonance. The phenomenon\noccurs in two different situations, i.e. when the minimum of the potential of\nthe dipole remains fixed in time and when it switches periodically between two\nequilibrium points. We have also found that the signal-to-noise ratio has a\nmaximum for a certain value of the amplitude of the oscillating field.\n", "  We study the Anderson model of localization with anisotropic hopping in three\ndimensions for weakly coupled chains and weakly coupled planes. The eigenstates\nof the Hamiltonian, as computed by Lanczos diagonalization for systems of sizes\nup to $48^3$, show multifractal behavior at the metal-insulator transition even\nfor strong anisotropy. The critical disorder strength $W_c$ determined from the\nsystem size dependence of the singularity spectra is in a reasonable agreement\nwith a recent study using transfer matrix methods. But the respective spectrum\nat $W_c$ deviates from the ``characteristic spectrum'' determined for the\nisotropic system. This indicates a quantitative difference of the multifractal\nproperties of states of the anisotropic as compared to the isotropic system.\nFurther, we calculate the Kubo conductivity for given anisotropies by exact\ndiagonalization. Already for small system sizes of only $12^3$ sites we observe\na rapidly decreasing conductivity in the directions with reduced hopping if the\ncoupling becomes weaker.\n", "  We present results from an extensive analytic and numerical study of a\ntwo-dimensional model of a square array of ultrasmall Josephson junctions. We\ninclude the ultrasmall self and mutual capacitances of the junctions, for the\nsame parameter ranges as those produced in the experiments. The model\nHamiltonian studied includes the Josephson, $E_J$, as well as the charging,\n$E_C$, energies between superconducting islands. The corresponding quantum\npartition function is expressed in different calculationally convenient ways\nwithin its path-integral representation. The phase diagram is analytically\nstudied using a WKB renormalization group (WKB-RG) plus a self-consistent\nharmonic approximation (SCHA) analysis, together with non-perturbative quantum\nMonte Carlo simulations. Most of the results presented here pertain to the\nsuperconductor to normal (S-N) region, although some results for the insulating\nto normal (I-N) region are also included. We find very good agreement between\nthe WKB-RG and QMC results when compared to the experimental data. To fit the\ndata, we only used the experimentally determined capacitances as fitting\nparameters. The WKB-RG analysis in the S-N region predicts a low temperature\ninstability i.e. a Quantum Induced Transition (QUIT). We carefully simulations\nand carry out a finite size analysis of $T_{QUIT}$ as a function of the\nmagnitude of imaginary time axis $L_\\tau$. We find that for some relatively\nlarge values of $\\alpha=E_C/E_J$ ($1\\leq \\alpha \\leq 2.25)$, the\n$L_\\tau\\to\\infty$ limit does appear to give a {\\it non-zero} $T_{QUIT}$, while\nfor $\\alpha \\ge 2.5$, $T_{QUIT}=0$. We use the SCHA to analytically understand\nthe $L_\\tau$ dependence of the QMC results with good agreement between them.\nFinally, we also carried out a WKB-RG analysis in the I-N region and found no\nevidence of a low temperature QUIT, up to lowest order in ${\\alpha}^{-1}$\n", "  The conclusions of a recent paper by Olsson (Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 2758\n(1995), cond-mat/9506082) about the fully frustrated XY model in two dimensions\nare questioned. In particular, the evidence presented for having two separate\nchiral and U(1) phase transitions are critically considered.\n", "  We have numerically studied the dynamic correlation functions in\nthermodynamic equilibrium of two-dimensional O(2)-symmetry models with either\nbond (RSJ) or site (TDGL) dissipation as a function of temperature T. We find\nthat above the critical temperature the frequency dependent flux noise\n$S_{\\Phi}(\\omega)\\sim \\vert 1+ {(\\omega/\\Omega)}^2\\vert^{-\\alpha (T)/2}$, with\n$0.85\\leq \\alpha (TDGL)(T)\\leq 0.95$ and $1.17 \\leq \\alpha (RSJ)(T) \\leq 1.27$,\nwhile the dynamic critical exponents $z(TDGL)\\sim 2.0$ and $z(RSJ)\\sim 0.9$.\nContrary to expectation the TDGL results are in closer agreement with the\nexperiments in Josephson-junction arrays by Shaw et al., than those from the\nRSJ model. We find that these results are related to anomalous vortex diffusion\nthrough vortex clusters.\n", "  We study the properties of the Bose glass phase of localized flux lines in\nirradiated superconductors near the matching field $B_{\\Phi}$. Repulsive vortex\ninteractions destroy the Mott insulator phase predicted to occur at $B=B_\\Phi$.\nFor ratios of the penetration depth to average defect distance $\\lambda / d\n\\leq 1$ remnants of the Mott insulator singularities remain visible in the\nmagnetization, the bulk modulus, and the magnetization relaxation, as B is\nvaried near $B_{\\Phi}$. For $\\lambda \\geq d$, the ensuing weakly pinned Bose\nglass is characterized by a soft Coulomb gap in the distribution of pinning\nenergies.\n", "  Phase-contrast microscopy is used to monitor the shapes of micron-scale\nfluid-phase phospholipid-bilayer vesicles in aqueous solution. At fixed\ntemperature, each vesicle undergoes thermal shape fluctuations. We are able\nexperimentally to characterize the thermal shape ensemble by digitizing the\nvesicle outline in real time and storing the time-sequence of images. Analysis\nof this ensemble using the area-difference-elasticity (ADE) model of vesicle\nshapes allows us to associate (map) each time-sequence to a point in the\nzero-temperature (shape) phase diagram. Changing the laboratory temperature\nmodifies the control parameters (area, volume, etc.) of each vesicle, so it\nsweeps out a trajectory across the theoretical phase diagram. It is a\nnontrivial test of the ADE model to check that these trajectories remain\nconfined to regions of the phase diagram where the corresponding shapes are\nlocally stable. In particular, we study the thermal trajectories of three\nprolate vesicles which, upon heating, experienced a mechanical instability\nleading to budding. We verify that the position of the observed instability and\nthe geometry of the budded shape are in reasonable accord with the theoretical\npredictions. The inability of previous experiments to detect the ``hidden''\ncontrol parameters (relaxed area difference and spontaneous curvature) make\nthis the first direct quantitative confrontation between vesicle-shape theory\nand experiment.\n", "  We have numerically and analytically studied ac+dc driven Josephson-junction\narrays with a single vortex or with a single vortex-antivortex pair present. We\nfind single-vortex steps in the voltage versus current characteristics (I-V) of\nthe array. They correspond microscopically to a single vortex phase-locked to\nmove a fixed number of plaquettes per period of the ac driving current. In\nunderdamped arrays we find vortex motion period doubling on the steps. We\nobserve subharmonic steps in both underdamped and overdamped arrays. We\nsuccessfully compare these results with a phenomenological model of vortex\nmotion with a nonlinear viscosity. The I-V of an array with a vortex-antivortex\npair displays fractional voltage steps. A possible connection of these results\nto present day experiments is also discussed.\n", "  Monte Carlo simulations and variational calculations using a Gaussian ansatz\nare applied to a model consisting of a flexible linear polyelectrolyte chain as\nwell as to an intrinsically stiff chain with up to 1000 charged monomers.\nAddition of salt is treated implicitly through a screened Coulomb potential for\nthe electrostatic interactions.\n  For the flexible model the electrostatic persistence length shows roughly\nthree regimes in its dependence on the Debye-H\\\"{u}ckel screening length,\n$\\kappa^{-1}$.As long as the salt content is low and $\\kappa^{-1}$ is longer\nthan the end-to-end distance, the electrostatic persistence length varies only\nslowly with $\\kappa^{-1}$. Decreasing the screening length, a controversial\nregion is entered. We find that the electrostatic persistence length scales as\n$sqrt{\\xi_p}/\\kappa$, in agreement with experiment on flexible\npolyelectrolytes, where $\\xi_p$ is a strength parameter measuring the\nelectrostatic interactions within the polyelectrolyte. For screening lengths\nmuch shorter than the bond length, the $\\kappa^{-1}$ dependence becomes\nquadratic in the variational calculation. The simulations suffer from numerical\nproblems in this regime, but seem to give a relationship half-way between\nlinear and quadratic.\n  A low temperature expansion only reproduces the first regime and a high\ntemperature expansion, which treats the electrostatic interactions as a\nperturbation to a Gaussian chain, gives a quadratic dependence on the Debye\nlength.\n  For a sufficiently stiff chain, the persistence length varies quadratically\nwith $\\kappa^{-1}$ in agreement with earlier theories.\n", "  We discuss numerical results for the 1-D spin 1/2 antiferromagnetic\nHeisenberg model with next-to-nearest neighbour coupling and in the presence of\nan uniform magnetic field. The model develops zero frequency excitations at\nfield dependent soft mode momenta. We compute critical quantities from finite\nsize dependence of static structure factors.\n", "  We discuss the role and the treatment of polarization effects in many-body\nsystems of charged conducting clusters and apply this to the statistical\nfragmentation of Na-clusters. We see a first order microcanonical phase\ntransition in the fragmentation of $Na^{Z+}_{70}$ for Z=0 to 8. We can\ndistinguish two fragmentation phases, namely evaporation of large particles\nfrom a large residue and a complete decay into small fragments only. Charging\nthe cluster shifts the transition to lower excitation energies and forces the\ntransition to disappear for charges higher than Z=8. At very high charges the\nfragmentation phase transition no longer occurs because the cluster\nCoulomb-explodes into small fragments even at excitation energy $\\epsilon^* =\n0$.\n", "  We show the appearance of spatiotemporal stochastic resonance in the\nSwift-Hohenberg equation. This phenomenon emerges when a control parameter\nvaries periodically in time around the bifurcation point. By using general\nscaling arguments and by taking into account the common features occurring in a\nbifurcation, we outline possible manifestations of the phenomenon in other\npattern-forming systems.\n", "  We analyze the consequences that the choice of the output of the system has\nin the efficiency of signal detection. It is shown that the signal and the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR), used to characterize the phenomenon of stochastic\nresonance, strongly depend on the form of the output. In particular, the SNR\nmay be enhanced for an adequate output.\n", "  We present a class of systems for which the signal-to-noise ratio as a\nfunction of the noise level may display a multiplicity of maxima. This\nphenomenon, referred to as stochastic multiresonance, indicates the possibility\nthat periodic signals may be enhanced at multiple values of the noise level,\ninstead of at a single value which has occurred in systems considered up to now\nin the framework of stochastic resonance.\n", "  We reply to the recent Comment [cond-mat/9702231] by J.-M. Duan. Our point of\nview is markedly different on every issue raised. Much of the disagreement can\nbe traced to a different preception of experimentally relevant length scales.\ni) We explain the difference between our formulation, which rests on a\nmicroscopic basis, and the phenomenological one of the author. ii) Our\nrenormalization scheme is fundamentally right, as the \"log(log)\" interaction\nappears only in wires of astronomical lengths. iii) The tunneling barrier is\nprofoundly reduced by the kinetic inductance. iv) We do make an appropriate\ncomparison to the data on the thinnest available wires.\n", "  A feedback neural network approach to communication routing problems is\ndeveloped with emphasis on Multiple Shortest Path problems, with several\nrequests for transmissions between distinct start- and endnodes. The basic\ningredients are a set of Potts neurons for each request, with interactions\ndesigned to minimize path lengths and to prevent overloading of network arcs.\nThe topological nature of the problem is conveniently handled using a\npropagator matrix approach. Although the constraints are global, the\nalgorithmic steps are based entirely on local information, facilitating\ndistributed implementations. In the polynomially solvable single-request case\nthe approach reduces to a fuzzy version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. The\napproach is evaluated for synthetic problems of varying sizes and load levels,\nby comparing with exact solutions from a branch-and-bound method. With very few\nexceptions, the Potts approach gives legal solutions of very high quality. The\ncomputational demand scales merely as the product of the numbers of requests,\nnodes, and arcs.\n", "  We use the density matrix renormalization group to study the quantum\ntransitions that occur in the half-filled one-dimensional fermionic Hubbard\nmodel with onsite potential disorder. We find a transition from the gapped Mott\nphase with algebraic spin correlations to a gapless spin-disordered phase\nbeyond a critical strength of the disorder $\\Delta_c \\approx U/2$. Both the\ntransitions in the charge and spin sectors are shown to be coincident. We also\nestablish the finite-size corrections to the charge gap and the spin-spin\ncorrelation length in the presence of disorder and using a finite-size-scaling\nanalysis we obtain the zero temperature phase diagram of the various quantum\nphase transitions that occur in the disorder-interaction plane.\n", "  We critically discuss relaxation experiments in magnetic systems that can be\ncharacterized in terms of an energy barrier distribution, showing that proper\nnormalization of the relaxation data is needed whenever curves corresponding to\ndifferent temperatures are to be compared. We show how these normalization\nfactors can be obtained from experimental data by using the $T \\ln(t/\\tau_0)$\nscaling method without making any assumptions about the nature of the energy\nbarrier distribution. The validity of the procedure is tested using a\nferrofluid of Fe_3O_4 particles.\n", "  We study using bosonization techniques the effects of frustration due to\ncompeting interactions and of the interchain elastic couplings on the soliton\nwidth and soliton structure in spin-Peierls systems. We compare the predictions\nof this study with numerical results obtained by exact diagonalization of\nfinite chains. We conclude that frustration produces in general a reduction of\nthe soliton width while the interchain elastic coupling increases it. We\ndiscuss these results in connection with recent measurements of the soliton\nwidth in the incommensurate phase of CuGeO_3.\n", "  We calculate the one-electron spectral function of the attractive\n(negative-$U$) Hubbard model. We work in the intermediate coupling and low\ndensity regime and obtain the self-energy in an approximate analytical form.\nThe excitation spectrum is found to consist of three branches. The results are\nobtained in a framework, based on the self-consistent T-matrix approximation,\nwhich is compatible with the Mermin-Wagner theorem.\n", "  We study the physical properties of an $s$-wave -- normal metal -- $d$-wave\njunction in terms of the Andreev bound states in the normal metal layer. The\nphase dependence of bound states with different orientations leads to\nsuperconducting states with broken time reversal symmetry for generic\norientations of the $d$-wave superconductor crystal. The occurrence of such a\nstate and the associated spontaneous supercurrent along the junction is\nanalyzed in the framework of Ginzburg-Landau theory and by the solution of the\nBogolyubov-de Gennes equations.\n", "  A system of N Brownian particles suspended in a nonuniform heat bath is\ntreated as a thermodynamic system whith internal degrees of freedom, in this\ncase their velocities and coordinates. Applying the scheme of non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics, one then easily obtains the Fokker-Planck equation for\nsimultaneous Brownian motion of N particles in a temperature gradient. This\nequation accounts for couplings in the motion as a result of hydrodynamic\ninteractions between particles.\n", "  The general expression for the local matrix $t(\\theta)$ of a quantum chain\nwith the site space in any representation of su(3) is obtained. This is made by\ngeneralizing $t(\\theta)$ from the fundamental representation and imposing the\nfulfillment of the Yang-Baxter equation. Then, a non-homogeneous spin chain\ncombining different representations of su(3) is solved by developing a method\ninspired in the nested Bethe ansatz. The solution for the eigenvalues of the\ntrace of the monodromy matrix is given as two coupled Bethe equations. A\nconjecture about the solution of a chain with the site states in different\nrepresentations of su(n) is presented. The thermodynamic limit of the ground\nstate is calculated.\n", "  A novel method is presented and explored within the framework of Potts neural\nnetworks for solving optimization problems with a non-trivial topology, with\nthe airline crew scheduling problem as a target application. The key ingredient\nto handle the topological complications is a propagator defined in terms of\nPotts neurons. The approach is tested on artificial problems generated with two\nreal-world problems as templates. The results are compared against the\nproperties of the corresponding unrestricted problems. The latter are subject\nto a detailed analysis in a companion paper [LU TP 97-11]. Very good results\nare obtained for a variety of problem sizes. The computer time demand for the\napproach only grows like (number of flights)^3. A realistic problem typically\nis solved within minutes, partly due to a prior reduction of the problem size,\nbased on an analysis of the local arrival/departure structure at the single\nairports.\n  To facilitate the reading for audiences not familiar with Potts neurons and\nmean field techniques, a brief review is given of recent advances in their\napplication to resource allocation problems.\n", "  A statistical analysis is performed for a random unrestricted local crew\nscheduling problem, expressed in terms of pairing arrivals with departures. The\nanalysis is aimed at understanding the structure of similar problems with\nglobal restrictions, and estimating their difficulty. The methods developed are\nof a general nature and can be of use in other problems with a similar\nstructure. For large random problems, the ground-state energy scales like\n\\sqrt{N} and the average excitation like N, where N is the number of\narrivals/departures. The average ground-state degeneracy is such that the\nprobability of hitting an optimal pairing by chance scales like 2N2^{-N} for\nlarge N. By insisting on the local ground-state energy for a restricted\nproblem, airports can be split into smaller parts, and the state space reduced\nby typically a factor ~ 2^{N_a}, with N_a the total number of airports.\n", "  We consider oblique incidence of (p)TM-polarized wave on the anisotropic\nsuperconducting slab, immersed on a dielectric media, such that its uniaxial\n(c) axis is perpendicular to the surfaces. The below and above plasma frequency\ntransmissivity patterns are studied and several of its properties determined,\nwithin the context of the Maxwell-London theory. Below, the regime is\nattenuated for any incident angle, and there is a transmissivity maximum, quite\npronounced in case of a very high external dielectric constant. Above, a\npropagative regime exists where the superconductor is a natural optical\nresonator, and we show here that the minimum of the transmission peaks are\nmodulated by an envelope function associated to the Brewster condition. We\npropose this set-up to obtain light with an extremely small transverse\nwavelength inside the superconductor.\n", "  Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) does not conserve energy and this\nprecludes its use in the study of thermal processes in complex fluids. We\npresent here a generalization of DPD that incorporates an internal energy and a\ntemperature variable for each particle. The dissipation induced by the\ndissipative forces between particles is invested in raising the internal energy\nof the particles. Thermal conduction occurs by means of (inverse) temperature\ndifferences. The model can be viewed as a simplified solver of the fluctuating\nhydrodynamic equations and opens up the possibility of studying thermal\nprocesses in complex fluids with a mesoscopic simulation technique.\n", "  A mechanism generating a $\\lambda$-type behavior in the specific heat of a\nBose gas near the critical temperature $T_c$ is discussed. It is shown to work\nfor a general class of quasiparticle spectra, and especially, for the\nBogoliubov's model of a weakly interacting Bose gas, where a\ntemperature-dependent quasi-particle spectrum is obtained.\n", "  We have analyzed the effects of the addition of external noise to\nnon-dynamical systems displaying intrinsic noise, and established general\nconditions under which stochastic resonance appears. The criterion we have\nfound may be applied to a wide class of non-dynamical systems, covering\nsituations of different nature. Some particular examples are discussed in\ndetail.\n", "  The crossover from double-junction behavior to single-junction behavior of\nultrasmall tunnel junctions is studied theoretically in a scanning-tunneling\nmicroscope setup. The independently variable tip temperature of the microscope\nis used to monitor the transition between both regimes.\n", "  The transmission of charge through an ultrasmall double junction is\nconsidered with Coulomb effects but at zero temperature. We construct an\nequation which describes the time development of the transmission probability\nof charges and solve this equation in terms of a recursion relation. The\nresults are compared with the double junction without charging effects.\n", "  We implement the numerical method of summing Green function diagrams on the\nMatsubara frequency axis for the fluctuation exchange (FLEX) approximation. Our\nmethod has previously been applied to the attractive Hubbard model for low\ndensity. Here we apply our numerical algorithm to the Hubbard model close to\nhalf filling ($\\rho = 0.40$), and for $T/t = 0.03$, in order to study the\ndynamics of one- and two-particle Green functions. For the values of the chosen\nparameters we see the formation of three branches which we associate with the a\ntwo-peak structure in the imaginary part of the self-energy. From the imaginary\npart of the self-energy we conclude that our system is a Fermi liquid (for the\ntemperature investigated here), since Im$\\Sigma(\\vec{k},\\omega) \\approx w^2$\naround the chemical potential. We have compared our fully self-consistent FLEX\nsolutions with a lower order approximation where the internal Green functions\nare approximated by free Green functions. These two approches, i.e., the fully\nselfconsistent and the non-selfconsistent ones give different results for the\nparameters considered here. However, they have similar global results for small\ndensities.\n", "  The effect of pressure on the low-frequency dielectric constant,\n$\\epsilon_0$, of single crystals of KNbO_3 is investigated by means of\ncapacitance measurements. The dielectric constant increases with pressure up to\n22.5 kbar, where it exhibits a large value ($\\epsilon_0$ = 5000), and then\ndecreases. This change in its behaviour is related to a phase transition\ninduced by pressure. On decompression, the samples do not revert back to the\nambient pressure phase.\n", "  The electronic and transport properties of atomic-size contacts are analyzed\ntheoretically using a self-consistent tight-binding model. Our results show\nthat, for s-like metals, a sufficiently narrow contact exhibits well defined\nresonant states at the Fermi energy, spatially localized in the neck region.\nThese states are robust with respect to disorder and provide a simple\nexplanation for the observed tendency to conductance quantization. It is also\nshown that these properties disappear for a sufficiently large contact area.\nThe possible relevance of this resonant states in scanning tunneling\nspectroscopy using sharp tips is briefly analized.\n", "  We have implemented a new numerical method to obtain the low-energy\nmany-particle states of the Coulomb glass. First, this method creates an\ninitial set of low-energy states by a hybrid of local search and simulated\nannealing approaches. Then, systematically investigating the surroundings of\nthe states found, this set is completed. The transition rates between these\nstates are calculated. The connectivity of the corresponding graph is analysed\nin dependence on temperature and duration of measurement. We study how the\nformation of clusters is reflected in the specific heat as non-ergodic effects.\n", "  We present a study of non-equilibrium superconductivity in DyBa2Cu3O7-d using\nphoto induced activation of mm-wave absorption (PIAMA). We monitor the time\nevolution of the thin film transmissivity at 5 cm-1 subject to pulsed infrared\nradiation. In addition to a positive bolometric signal we observe a second,\nfaster, decay with a sign opposite to the bolometric signal for T>40 K. We\nattribute this to the unusual properties of quasi-particles residing near the\nnodes of an unconventional superconductor, resulting in a strong enhancement of\nthe recombination time.\n", "  We explore the effect of the imaginary part of the self-energy,\n$Im\\Sigma(\\vec{k},\\omega)$, having a single pole, $\\Omega(\\vec{k},\\omega)$,\nwith spectral weight, $\\alpha(\\vec{k})$, and quasi-particle lifetime,\n$\\Gamma(\\vec{k})$, on the density of states. We solve the set of parameters,\n$\\Omega(\\vec{k},\\omega$), $\\alpha(\\vec{k})$, and $\\Gamma(\\vec{k})$ by means of\nthe moment approach (exact sum rules) of Nolting. Our choice for\n$\\Sigma(k,\\omega)$, satisfies the Kramers - Kronig relationship automatically.\nDue to our choice of the self - energy, the system is not a Fermi liquid for\nany value of the interaction, a result which is also true in the moment\napproach of Nolting without lifetime effects. By increasing the value of the\nlocal interaction, $U/W$, at half-filling ($\\rho = 1/2$), we go from a\nparamagnetic metal to a paramagnetic insulator, (Mott metal - insulator\ntransition ($MMIT$)) for values of $U/W$ of the order of $U/W \\geq 1$ ($W$ is\nthe band width) which is in agreement with numerical results for finite\nlattices and for infinity dimensions ($D = \\infty$). These results settle down\nthe main weakness of the spherical approximation of Nolting: a finite gap for\nany finite value of the interaction, i.e., an insulator for any finite value of\n$U/W$. Lifetime effects are absolutely indispensable. Our scheme works better\nthan the one of improving the narrowing band factor, $B(\\vec{k})$, beyond the\nspherical approximation of Nolting.\n", "  We analyze the motion of individual beads of a polymer chain using a discrete\nversion of De Gennes' reptation model that describes the motion of a polymer\nthrough an ordered lattice of obstacles. The motion within the tube can be\nevaluated rigorously, tube renewal is taken into account in an approximation\nmotivated by random walk theory. We find microstructure effects to be present\nfor remarkably large times and long chains, affecting essentially all present\nday computer experiments. The various asymptotic power laws, commonly\nconsidered as typical for reptation, hold only for extremely long chains.\nFurthermore, for an arbitrary segment even in a very long chain, we find a rich\nvariety of fairly broad crossovers, which for practicably accessible chain\nlengths overlap and smear out the asymptotic power laws. Our analysis suggests\nobservables specifically adapted to distinguish reptation from motions\ndominated by disorder of the environment.\n", "  We analyze recent measurements of the room temperature current-voltage\ncharacteristics of gold nanowires, whose zero current conductance is quantized\nin units of $2e^2/h$. A faster than linear increase of current with voltage was\nobserved at low voltages beginning from $V_c=0.1$V. We analyze the nonlinear\nbehavior in terms of a dynamic Coulomb blockade of conducting modes and show\nthat it may be explained as a Luttinger-liquid effect.\n", "  We present results from magnetic resonance measurements for 75-350 GHz in\n$\\alpha$'-NaV$_{2}$O$_{5}$. The temperature dependence of the integrated\nintensity indicates that we observe transitions in the excited state. A\nquantitative description gives resonances in the triplet state at high symmetry\npoints of the excitation spectrum of this Spin-Peierls compound. This energy\nhas the same temperature dependence as the Spin-Peierls gap. Similarities and\ndifferences with the other inorganic compound CuGeO$_{3}$ are discussed.\n", "  Temperature and magnetic field dependent polarized Brillouin spectra of\nCuGeO_3 are reported. In addition to a bound singlet state at 30 cm^{-1}, a new\nfeature has been observed at 18 cm^{-1}. This feature is interpreted in terms\nof a novel three-magnon light scattering process between excited triplet\nstates.\n", "  We show that scaling arguments are very useful to analyze the dynamics of\nperiodically modulated noisy systems. Information about the behavior of the\nrelevant quantities, such as the signal-to-noise ratio, upon variations of the\nnoise level, can be obtained by analyzing the symmetries and invariances of the\nsystem. In this way, it is possible to predict diverse physical manifestations\nof the cooperative behavior between noise and input signal, as for instance\nstochastic resonance, spatiotemporal stochastic resonance, and stochastic\nmultiresonance.\n", "  We have simulated, by using cluster algorithm, the $q=8$ state Potts model in\ntwo-dimension with varying amount of quenched bond randomness. We have shown\nthat there exist a finite size dependent threshold value of the introduced\nquenched bond randomness for rounding the first-order phase transition and this\nthreshold value becomes smaller as the system size increased.\n", "  A new simple model exhibiting a noise-induced ordering transition (NIOT) and\na noise-induced disordering transition (NIDT), in which the noise is purely\nmultiplicative, is presented. Both transitions are found in two as well as in\none dimension (where they had not been previously reported). We show\nanalytically and numerically that the critical behavior of these two\ntransitions is described by the so called multiplicative noise(MN) universality\nclass. A computation of the set of critical exponents is presented in both\n$d=1$, and $d=2$ (where they have not been previously measured).\n", "  New theoretical and numerical analysis of the one-dimensional contact process\nwith quenched disorder are presented.\n  We derive new scaling relations, different from their counterparts in the\npure model, which are valid not only at the critical point but also away from\nit due to the presence of generic scale invariance. All the proposed scaling\nlaws are verified in numerical simulations. In addition we map the disordered\ncontact process into a Non-Markovian contact process by using the so called Run\nTime Statistic, and write down the associated field theory. This turns out to\nbe in the same universality class as one derived by Janssen for the quenched\nsystem with a Gaussian distribution of impurities.\n  Our findings here support the lack of universality suggested by the field\ntheoretical analysis: generic power-law behaviors are obtained, evidence is\nshown of the absence of a characteristic time away from the critical point, and\nthe absence of universality is put forward. The intermediate sublinear regime\npredicted by Bramsom et al. is also found.\n", "  The associated Hamiltonian for a su(3) spin chain combining ${3}$ and\n${3^{*}}$ representations is calculated. The ansatz equations for this chain\nare obtained and solved in the thermodynamic limit, and the ground state and\nexcitations are described. Thus, relations between the number of roots and the\nnumber of holes in each level have been found . The excited states are\ncharacterized by means of these quantum numbers. Finally, the exact S matrix\nfor a state with two holes is found.\n", "  We have analyzed the interplay between noise and periodic spatial modulations\nin bistable systems outside equilibrium and found that noise is able to\nincrease the spatial order of the system, giving rise to periodic patterns\nwhich otherwise look random. This new phenomenon, which may be viewed as the\nspatial counterpart of stochastic resonance, then shows a constructive role of\nnoise in spatially extended systems, not considered up to now.\n", "  We have analyzed the interplay between noise and periodic modulations in a\nmean field model of a neural excitable medium. To this purpose, we have\nconsidered two types of modulations; namely, variations of the resistance and\noscillations of the threshold. In both cases, stochastic resonance is present,\nirrespective of if the system is monostable or bistable.\n", "  We study the interface dynamics of a discrete model to quantitatively\ndescribe electrochemical deposition experiments. Extensive numerical\nsimulations indicate that the interface dynamics is unstable at early times,\nbut asymptotically displays the scaling of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality\nclass. During the time interval in which the surface is unstable, its power\nspectrum is anomalous; hence the behaviors at length scales smaller than or\ncomparable with the system size are described by different roughness exponents.\nThese results are expected to apply to a wide range of electrochemical\ndeposition experiments.\n", "  A feedback neural approach to static communication routing in asymmetric\nnetworks is presented, where a mean field formulation of the Bellman-Ford\nmethod for the single unicast problem is used as a common platform for\ndeveloping algorithms for multiple unicast, multicast and multiple multicast\nproblems. The appealing locality and update philosophy of the Bellman-Ford\nalgorithm is inherited. For all problem types the objective is to minimize a\ntotal connection cost, defined as the sum of the individual costs of the\ninvolved arcs, subject to capacity constraints. The methods are evaluated for\nsynthetic problem instances by comparing to exact solutions for cases where\nthese are accessible, and else with approximate results from simple heuristics.\nThe computational demand is modest.\n", "  We use finite-size scaling to investigate the critical behavior of the\nquasiespecies model of molecular evolution in the single-sharp-peak replication\nlandscape. This model exhibits a sharp threshold phenomenon at Q=Q_c=1/a, where\nQ is the probability of exact replication of a molecule of length L and a is\nthe selective advantage of the master string.\n  We investigate the sharpness of the threshold and find that its\ncharacteristic persist across a range of Q of order L^(-1) about Q_c.\nFurthermore, using the data collapsing method we show that the normalized mean\nHamming distance between the master string and the entire population, as well\nas the properly scaled fluctuations around this mean value, follow universal\nforms in the critical region.\n", "  We study the dynamic response to external currents of periodic arrays of\nJosephson junctions, in a resistively capacitively shunted junction (RCSJ)\nmodel, including full capacitance-matrix effects}. We define and study three\ndifferent models of the capacitance matrix $C_{\\vec{r},\\vec{r}'}$: Model A\nincludes only mutual capacitances; Model B includes mutual and self\ncapacitances, leading to exponential screening of the electrostatic fields;\nModel C includes a dense matrix $C_{\\vec{r},\\vec{r}'}$ that is constructed\napproximately from superposition of an exact analytic solution for the\ncapacitance between two disks of finite radius and thickness. In the latter\ncase the electrostatic fields decay algebraically. For comparison, we have also\nevaluated the full capacitance matrix using the MIT fastcap algorithm, good for\nsmall lattices, as well as a corresponding continuum effective-medium analytic\nevaluation of a finite voltage disk inside a zero-potential plane. In all cases\nthe effective $C_{\\vec{r},\\vec{r}'}$ decays algebraically with distance, with\ndifferent powers. We have then calculated current voltage characteristics for\nDC+AC currents for all models. We find that there are novel giant capacitive\nfractional steps in the I-V's for Models B and C, strongly dependent on the\namount of screening involved. We find that these fractional steps are quantized\nin units inversely proportional to the lattice sizes and depend on the\nproperties of $C_{\\vec{r},\\vec{r}'}$. We also show that the capacitive steps\nare not related to vortex oscillations but to localized screened phase-locking\nof a few rows in the lattice. The possible experimental relevance of these\nresults is also discussed.\n", "  A new strongly correlated electron model is presented. This is formed by two\ntypes of sites: one where double occupancy is forbidden, as in the t-J model,\nand the other where double occupancy is allowed but vacancy is not allowed, as\nan inverse t-J model. The Hamiltonian shows nearest and next-to-nearest\nneighbour interactions and it is solved by means of a modified algebraic nested\nBethe Ansatz. The number of sites where vacancy is not allowed, may be treated\nas a new parameter if the model is looked at as a t-J model with impurities.\nThe ground and excited states are described in the thermodynamic limit.\n", "  Within the mode-coupling theory for structural relaxation in simple systems\nthe asymptotic laws and their leading-asymptotic correction formulas are\nderived for the motion of a tagged particle near a glass-transition\nsingularity. These analytic results are compared with numerical ones of the\nequations of motion evaluated for a tagged hard sphere moving in a hard-sphere\nsystem. It is found that the long-time part of the two-step relaxation process\nfor the mean-squared displacement can be characterized by the $\\alpha\n$-relaxation-scaling law and von Schweidler's power-law decay while the\ncritical-decay regime is dominated by the corrections to the leading power-law\nbehavior. For parameters of interest for the interpretations of experimental\ndata, the corrections to the leading asymptotic laws for the non-Gaussian\nparameter are found to be so large that the leading asymptotic results are\naltered qualitatively by the corrections. Results for the non-Gaussian\nparameter are shown to follow qualitatively the findings reported in the\nmolecular-dynamics-simulations work by Kob and Andersen [Phys. Rev. E 51, 4626\n(1995)].\n", "  A new type of Langevin equation exhibiting a non trivial phase transition\nassociated with the presence of multiplicative noise is introduced. The\nequation is derived as a mesoscopic representation of the microscopic annealed\nIsing model (AIM) proposed by Thorpe and Beeman, and reproduces perfectly its\nbasic phenomenology. The AIM exhibits a non-trivial behavior as the temperature\nis increased, in particular it presents a disorder-to-order phase transition at\nlow temperatures, and a order-to-disorder transition at higher temperatures.\nThis behavior resembles that of some Langevin equations with multiplicative\nnoise, which exhibit also two analogous phase transitions as the\nnoise-amplitude is increased. By comparing the standard models for\nnoise-induced transitions with our new Langevin equation we elucidate that the\nmechanisms controlling the disorder-to-order transitions in both of them are\nessentially different, even though for both of them the presence of\nmultiplicative noise is a key ingredient.\n", "  Spin fluctuation-induced superconductivity in two-dimensional organic\ncompounds such as \\kappa-(ET)_2-X is investigated by using a simplified dimer\nHubbard model with right-angled isosceles triangular lattice (transfer matrices\n-\\tau, -\\tau^\\prime). The dynamical susceptiblity and the self-energy are\ncalculated self-consistently within the fluctuation exchange approximation and\nthe value for T_c as obtained by solving the linearized Eliashberg-type\nequations is in good agreement with experiment. The pairing symmetry is of\nd_{x^2-y^2} type. The calculated (U/\\tau)-dependence of T_c compares\nqualitatively well with the observed pressure dependence of T_c. Varying the\nvalue for \\tau^\\prime/\\tau from 0 to 1 we interpolate between the square\nlattice and the regular triangular lattice and find firstly that values of T_c\nfor \\kappa-(ET)_2-X and cuprates scale well and secondly that T_c tends to\ndecrease with increasing \\tau^\\prime/\\tau and no superconductivity is found for\n\\tau^\\prime/\\tau=1, the regular triangular lattice.\n", "  We report low-temperature shot noise measurements of short diffusive Au wires\nattached to electron reservoirs of varying sizes. The measured noise\nsuppression factor compared to the classical noise value $2e\\left| I\\right| $\nstrongly depends on the electric heat conductance of the reservoirs. For small\nreservoirs injection of hot electrons increases the measured noise and hence\nthe suppression factor. The universal 1/3-suppression factor can only\nasymptotically be reached for macroscopically large and thick electron\nreservoirs. A heating model based on the Wiedemann-Franz law is used to explain\nthis effect.\n", "  Using molecular dynamics simulations, with a realistic many-body\nembedded-atom potential, and a novel method to characterize local order, we\nstudy the structure of pure nickel during the rapid quench of the liquid and in\nthe resulting glass. In contrast with previous simulations with pair\npotentials, we find more crystalline order and fewer icosahedra for slower\nquenching rates, resulting in a glass less stable against crystallization. It\nis shown that there is not a specific amorphous structure, only the arrest of\nthe transition from liquid to crystal, resulting in small crystalline clusters\nimmersed in an amorphous matrix with the same structure of the liquid.\n", "  Using the Dyson equation of motion for both the diagonal one-particle Green\nfunction, $G(\\vec{k},\\omega)$ and off--diagonal Green function,\n$F(\\vec{k},\\omega)$, at the level of the Hubbard--I decoupling scheme, we have\nfound that they have four poles symmetric in pairs, justifying a more\nelaborated calculation done by the Z\\\"urich group by means of the $T$-Matrix\napproach (Pedersen et al, Z. Physik B {\\bf 103}, 21 (1997)) and the moment\napproach of Nolting (Z. Physik {\\bf 255}, 25 (1972)). We find that the energy\nspectra and the weights of $G(\\vec{k},\\omega)$ and $F(\\vec{k},\\omega)$ have to\nbe calculated self-consistently. $G(\\vec{k},\\omega)$ satisfies the first two\nmoments while $F(\\vec{k},\\omega)$ the first sum rule. Our {\\it order parameter}\n$\\alpha(T)$ is given by $1/N_s \\sum_{{\\vec{k}}}\n\\epsilon({\\vec{k}})\\Delta({\\vec{k}})$. Due to the fact that we have a purely\nlocal attractive interaction $\\Delta(\\vec{k})$ can be of {\\it any} s--type\nwave. However, for a {\\it pure s--wave}, for which $\\alpha(T) = 0$, we go back\nto the mean--field $BCS$ results, with a renormalized chemical potential. In\nthis case, the off--diagonal Green function, $F(\\vec{k},\\omega)$, satisfies the\nfirst two off--diagonal sum rules. We explicitly state the range of validity of\nour approximation.\n", "  We study the one-dimensional spin-1/2 model with nearest and\nnext-to-nearest-neighbor couplings exposed to a homogeneous magnetic field\n$h_{3}$ and a dimer field with period $q$ and strength $\\delta$. The latter\ngenerates a magnetization plateau at $M=(1-q/\\pi)/2$, which evolves with\nstrength $\\delta$ of the perturbation as $\\delta^{\\epsilon}$, where\n$\\epsilon=\\epsilon(h_{3},\\alpha)$ is related to the $\\eta$-exponent which\ndescribes the critical behavior of the dimer structure factor, if the\nperturbation is switched of ($\\delta=0$). We also discuss the appearance of\nmagnetization plateaus in ladder systems with $l$ legs.\n", "  We clarify the path integral calculation, recently suggested by Golubev and\nZaikin, and show, contrary to their claim, that quasiparticles become fully\ncoherent quantum particles in the $T \\to 0$ limit. The important physical point\nis the inclusion of the recoil of the quasiparticle when interacting with\nfluctuations in the rest of the Fermi gas.\n", "  We evaluate the one-particle and double-occupied Green functions for the\nHubbard model at half-filling using the moment approach of Nolting. Our\nstarting point is a self-energy, $\\Sigma(\\vec{k},\\omega)$, which has a single\npole, $\\Omega(\\vec{k})$, with {\\it spectral} weight, $\\alpha(\\vec{k})$, and\nquasi-particle lifetime, $\\gamma(\\vec{k})$. In our approach,\n$\\Sigma(\\vec{k},\\omega)$ becomes the central feature of the many-body problem\nand due to three unkown $\\vec{k}$-parameters we have to satisfy only the first\nthree sum rules instead of four as in the canonical formulation of Nolting.\nThis self-energy choice forces our system to be a non-Fermi liquid for any\nvalue of the interaction, since it does not vanish at zero frequency. The\none-particle Green function, $G(\\vec{k},\\omega)$, shows the finger-print of a\nstrongly correlated system, i.e., a double peak structure in the one-particle\nspectral density, $A(\\vec{k},\\omega)$, vs $\\omega$ for intermediate values of\nthe interaction. Close to the Mott Insulator-Transition, $A(\\vec{k},\\omega)$,\nbecomes a wide single peak, signaling the absence of quasi-particles.\n", "  We study the correlation $<\\sigma^z_0\\sigma^z_n>$ for the XXZ chain in the\nmassless attractive (ferromagnetic) region at positive temperatures by means of\na numerical study of the quantum transfer matrix. We find that there is a range\nof temperature where the behavior of the correlation for large separations is\noscillatory with an incommensurate period which depends on temperature.\n", "  We reported two-magnon Raman scattering from La_{1.9}Sr_{0.1}CuO_4, which has\na suppressed Tc=12 K, as the temperature is lowered below 37 K and an ordered\nspin phase is formed. The two-magnon Raman intensity increases with decreasing\ntemperature. The magnetic scattering in La_{1.9}Sr_{0.1}CuO_4 is totally\ndifferent from that reported in the parent compound La_2CuO_4. We analyze the\nline shape of the two-magnon scattering within the traditional Loudon-Fleury\ntheory and find the superexchange constant J=1052 cm^{-1}. The calculation of\nthe frequency moment suggests that the quantum fluctuations are very weak in\nthe system. The room temperature Raman scattering from La_2CuO_4 is also\nmeasured. Strong features appear in the one-phonon spectrum at the frequencies\nof the longitudinal optical (LO) infrared modes which we suggest become Raman\nactive through a Fr\\\"{o}hlich-interaction.\n", "  The linear and cubic dynamic susceptibilities of solid dispersions of\nnano-sized maghemite particles have been measured for three samples with a\nvolume concentration of magnetic particles ranging from 0.3 % to 17 %, in order\nto study the effect of dipole-dipole interactions. Significant differences\nbetween the dynamic response of the three samples are observed. The dynamic\nsusceptibilities of the most dilute sample compare reasonably well with an\nexisting theory for the linear and cubic dynamic susceptibilities of an\nassembly of noninteracting, uniaxial magnetic particles. The nonlinear dynamic\nresponse of the most concentrated sample exhibits at low temperatures some of\nthe features observed in a Ag(11 at.% Mn) spin glass.\n", "  We review our recent magnetotransport and micromagnetic studies of\nlithographically defined epitaxial thin film structures of bcc Fe and hcp Co\nwith stripe domains. Micromagnetic structure and resistivity anisotropy are\nshown to be the predominant sources of low field magnetoresistance (MR) in\nthese microstructures, with domain wall (DW) effects smaller but observable\n(DW-MR $\\lesssim 1 %$). In Fe, at low temperature, in a regime in which fields\nhave a significant effect on electron trajectories, a novel negative DW\ncontribution to the resistivity is observed. In hcp Co microstructures,\ntemperature dependent transport measurements for current perpendicular and\nparallel to walls show that any additional resistivity due to DW scattering is\nvery small.\n", "  We study bulk and edge correlations in the compressible half-filled state,\nusing a modified version of the plasma analogy. The corresponding plasma has\nanomalously weak screening properties, and as a consequence we find that the\ncorrelations along the edge do not decay algebraically as in the Laughlin\n(incompressible) case, while the bulk correlations decay in the same way. The\nresults suggest that due to the strong coupling between charged modes on the\nedge and the neutral Fermions in the bulk, reflected by the weak screening in\nthe plasma analogue, the (attractive) correlation hole is not well defined on\nthe edge. Hence, the system there can be modeled as a free Fermi gas of {\\em\nelectrons} (with an appropriate boundary condition). We finally comment on a\npossible scenario, in which the Laughlin-like dynamical edge correlations may\nnevertheless be realized.\n", "  We have investigated the magnetic and the superconducting properties of the\nhybrid ruthenate-cuprate compound RuSr_{2}GdCu_{2}O_{8} by means of zero-field\nmuon spin rotation- (ZF-$\\mu $SR) and DC magnetization measurements. The\nDC-magnetisation data establish that this material exhibits ferromagnetic order\nof the Ru-moments ($\\mu (Ru) \\approx 1 \\mu_{B}$) below T_{Curie} = 133 K and\nbecomes superconducting at a much lower temperature T_c = 16 K. The ZF-$\\mu $SR\nexperiments indicate that the ferromagnetic phase is homogeneous on a\nmicroscopic scale and accounts for most of the sample volume. They also suggest\nthat the magnetic order is not significantly modified at the onset of\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  By means of extensive equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations we have\ninvestigated, the behavior of the interfacial tension $\\gamma$ of two\nimmiscible symmetrical Lennard-Jones fluids. This quantity is studied as\nfunction of reduced temperature $T^{*}={{k_{_B} T}\\over \\epsilon}$ in the range\n$0.6 \\leq T^{*} \\leq 3.0$. We find that, unlike the monotonic decay obtained\nfor the liquid-vapor interfacial tension, for the liquid-liquid interface,\n$\\gamma (T)$ has a maximum at a specific temperature. We also investigate the\neffect that surfactant-like particles has on the thermodynamic as well as the\nstructural properties of the liquid-liquid interface. It is found that $\\gamma$\ndecays monotonically as the concentration of the surfactant-like particles\nincreases.\n", "  We investigate groundstate energies and magnetization curves in the one\ndimensional XXZ-model with next to nearest neighbour coupling $\\alpha>0$ and\nanisotropy $\\Delta$ ($-1 \\le \\Delta \\le 1$) at T=0. In between the familiar\nferro- and antiferromagnetic phase we find a transition region -- called\nmetamagnetic phase -- where the magnetization curve is discontinuous at a\ncritical field $B_c(\\alpha,\\Delta)$.\n", "  We have studied a quantum Hamiltonian that models an array of ultrasmall\nJosephson junctions with short range Josephson couplings, $E_J$, and charging\nenergies, $E_C$, due to the small capacitance of the junctions. We derive a new\neffective quantum spherical model for the array Hamiltonian. As an application\nwe start by approximating the capacitance matrix by its self-capacitive limit\nand in the presence of an external uniform background of charges, $q_x$. In\nthis limit we obtain the zero-temperature superconductor-insulator phase\ndiagram, $E_J^{\\rm crit}(E_C,q_x)$, that improves upon previous theoretical\nresults that used a mean field theory approximation. Next we obtain a\nclosed-form expression for the conductivity of a square array, and derive a\nuniversal scaling relation valid about the zero--temperature quantum critical\npoint. In the latter regime the energy scale is determined by temperature and\nwe establish universal scaling forms for the frequency dependence of the\nconductivity.\n", "  A model study for the coexistence of the spin density wave and\nsuperconductivity is presented. With reference to the recent angle resolved\nphoto emmission experimental data in high T_c cuprates, presence of the nested\npieces of bands is assumed. The single band Hubbard model, therefore, when\ntreated within the Hatree-Fock mean field theory leads to a spin density wave\n(SDW) ground state. The superconductivity (SC) is assumed to be due to a\ngeneralised attractive potential with a separable form without specifying to\nany particular origin. It therefore allows a comparative study of the\ncoexistence of superconductivity of different order parameter symmetry with the\nspin density wave state. We find that the phase diagram, comprising of the\namplitudes of the respective gaps (SC and SDW) Vs. band filling resembles to\nthat of the high T_c cuprates only when the order parameter of the\nsuperconducting phase has d-wave symmetry. Thermal variation of different order\nparameters (e.g, SC and SDW) also show interesting coexistence and reentrance\nbehaviors that are consistent with experimental observations, specially for the\nborocarbides.\n", "  We examine the paper basic equations of T. Doma\\'nski and K.I. Wysoki\\'nski\n[Phys. Rev. B {\\bf 59}, 173 (1999)], who calculated the critical\nsuperconducting temperature, T_c, in function of Coulomb correlations (U) for\ns- and d-wave order parameter symmetries. We give physical arguments, based on\ngeneral theory of perturbation, that in their gap equation the Coulomb\nrepulsion is counted twice. Because of that, we write down the right mean-field\ngap equation and solve it by using a normal state one-particle Green function\nwhich gives a Mott metal-insulator transition for $T > T_c$ and which is valid\nfor any value of U. In consequence, we are not allowed to use mean-field theory\nfor both U and pairing (V). Our numerical results for T_c vs U shows that U is\ndetrimental to superconductivity which agrees with the numerical results of\nDoma\\'nski and Wysoki\\'nski. Our results can be extended to any value of the\npairing interaction if superconducting pairing fluctuations are taken into\naccount.\n", "  A phase diagram of the t-J three-leg ladder as a function of hole dopping is\nderived in the limit where the coupling parameters along the rungs, $t_{\\perp}$\nand $J_{\\perp}$, are taken to be much larger than those along the legs,\n$t_{||}$ and $J_{||}$ At large exchange coupling along the rungs,\n$J_{\\perp}/t_{\\perp}> 3 / \\sqrt{2}$, there is a transition from a low-dopping\nLuttinger liquid phase into a Luther-Emery liquid at a critical hole\nconcentration $n_{crit}\\approx 1/3$. In the opposite case,\n$J_{\\perp}/t_{\\perp}< 3 / \\sqrt{2}$, there as a sequence of three Luttinger\nliquid phases (LLI, LLII and LLIII) as a function of hole dopping.\n", "  Spin fluctuation-induced superconductivity in quasi-two dimensional organic\ncompounds, \\kappa-BEDT-TTF salts, is investigated within a fluctuation exchange\n(FLEX) approximation using a half-filled Hubbard model with a right-angled\nisosceles triangular lattice (transfer matrices -\\tau, -\\tau^\\prime), extending\na previous work above T_c. An energy gap of A_2 or (x^2-y^2)-type develops with\ndecreasing temperature below T_c more rapidly than in the BCS model. The\ncalculated dynamical susceptibilities enough below T_c show sharp resonance\npeaks like those in certain cuprates superconductors. The calculated nuclear\nspin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T_1 shows a T^3 behavior below T_c in accordance\nwith experiment. Estimated values of 1/T_1 are roughly consistent with\nexperimental results. A prediction is made for the doping concentration\ndependence of T_c and the antiferromagnetic and superconductive instability\npoints are calculated in the U/\\tau vs. \\tau^\\prime/\\tau plane.\n", "  We consider the critical and off-critical properties at the boundary of the\nrandom transverse-field Ising spin chain when the distribution of the couplings\nand/or transverse fields, at a distance $l$ from the surface, deviates from its\nuniform bulk value by terms of order $l^{-\\kappa}$ with an amplitude $A$. Exact\nresults are obtained using a correspondence between the surface magnetization\nof the model and the surviving probability of a random walk with time-dependent\nabsorbing boundary conditions. For slow enough decay, $\\kappa<1/2$, the\ninhomogeneity is relevant: Either the surface stays ordered at the bulk\ncritical point or the average surface magnetization displays an essential\nsingularity, depending on the sign of $A$. In the marginal situation,\n$\\kappa=1/2$, the average surface magnetization decays as a power law with a\ncontinuously varying, $A$-dependent, critical exponent which is obtained\nanalytically. The behavior of the critical and off-critical autocorrelation\nfunctions as well as the scaling form of the probability distributions for the\nsurface magnetization and the first gaps are determined through a\nphenomenological scaling theory. In the Griffiths phase, the properties of the\nGriffiths-McCoy singularities are not affected by the inhomogeneity. The\nvarious results are checked using numerical methods based on a mapping to free\nfermions.\n", "  Physical properties of anisotropic superconductors like the critical\ntemperature and others depend sensitively on the electron mean free path. The\nsensitivity to impurity scattering and the resulting anomalies are considered a\ncharacteristic feature of strongly anisotropic pairing. These anomalies are\nusually analyzed in terms of s-wave impurity scattering which leads to\nuniversal pair breaking effects depending on only two scattering parameters,\nthe mean free path and the impurity cross section. We investigate here\ncorrections coming from anisotropies in the scattering cross section, and find\nnot only quantitative but also qualitative deviations from universal s-wave\nisotropic pairbreaking. The properties we study are the transition temperature,\nthe density of states, quasiparticle bound states at impurities, and pinning of\nflux lines by impurities.\n", "  The effective interaction between charged colloidal particles confined\nbetween two planar like-charged walls is investigated using computer\nsimulations of the primitive model describing asymmetric electrolytes. In\ndetail, we calculate the effective force acting onto a single macroion and onto\na macroion pair in the presence of slit-like confinement. For moderate Coulomb\ncoupling, we find that this force is repulsive. Under strong coupling\nconditions, however, the sign of the force depends on the distance to the\nplates and on the interparticle distance. In particular, the particle-plate\ninteraction becomes strongly attractive for small distances which may explain\nthe occurrence of colloidal crystalline layers near the plates observed in\nrecent experiments.\n", "  All the new layer perovskite superconductors seem to show a phenomenon of\nsymmetry mixing with repect to the order parameter. An analysis of the\ndifferent alternative of mixing and how far could them be presented is carried\nout. For the particular case of s+id symmetry of the gap, the temperature\ndependence of the specific heat ($C_{es}$) and the thermodynamic critical\nmagnetic field ($H_{c}$) are calculated. A double peak transition is observed\non $C_{es}(T)$ in the mixed regime while the single peak behavior is recovered\nfor a purely symmetric state (s or d). $C_{es}$ presents a quadratic law at low\ntempeartures for a d-wave gap and for the s-wave one the typical exponential\nattenuation. The temperature dependence of $H_{c}$ shows a clear phase\ntransition of second order at temperatures where the d-wave component becomes\nnegligible. A comparison with other results and experiments is done.\n", "  Recent evidence suggests that physiological signals under healthy conditions\nmay have a fractal temporal structure. We investigate the possibility that time\nseries generated by certain physiological control systems may be members of a\nspecial class of complex processes, termed multifractal, which require a large\nnumber of exponents to characterize their scaling properties. We report on\nevidence for multifractality in a biological dynamical system --- the healthy\nhuman heartbeat. Further, we show that the multifractal character and nonlinear\nproperties of the healthy heart rate are encoded in the Fourier phases. We\nuncover a loss of multifractality for a life-threatening condition, congestive\nheart failure.\n", "  The effect of strong laser radiation on magnetic subbands in semiconductor\nsuperlattices is investigated. Due to the presence of a magnetic field\nperpendicular to the growth direction, non-linear effects such as band\nsupression and electron localization become relevant at relatively lower\nintensities and for any polarization perpendicular to the magnetic field.\nElectron quasienergies and density of states are calculated in the\nKramers-Henneberger approximation, whose validity is discussed. The conditions\nunder which collapse of magnetic subbands and quenching of N-photon emission or\nabsorption processes occur are discussed. We conclude that at laser frequencies\nclose to cyclotronic frequency and intensities typical of c.w. lasers, magnetic\nsubbands become flat, magnetotunneling is inhibited and multiphotonic processes\ndominate optical absorption.\n", "  The accuracy of equation-of-state formulations is compared for theoretical\ntotal energies or experimental pressure-volume measurements for H$_{2}$, Ne,\nPt, and Ta. This spans the entire range of compression found for minerals and\nvo latiles in the Earth. The Vinet equation is found to be most accurate. The\norigin of the behavior of different equation-of-state formulations is\ndiscussed. It is shown that subtle phase transitions can be detected by\nexamining the residuals from an equation-of-state fit. A change in the\nelectronic structure of Ta is found at high pressures using this procedure, and\na possible new transition in H$_{2}$.\n", "  Stimulated small-angle light scattering was used to measure the structure\nfactor of a Bose-Einstein condensate in the phonon regime. The excitation\nstrength for phonons was found to be significantly reduced from that of free\nparticles, revealing the presence of correlated pair excitations and quantum\ndepletion in the condensate. The Bragg resonance line strength and line shift\nagreed with predictions of a local density approximation.\n", "  We study the fermionic states of the antiferromagnetically ordered vortex\ncores predicted to exist in the superconducting phase of the newly proposed\nSO(5) model of strongly correlated electrons. Our model calculation gives a\nnatural explanation of the recent STM measurements on BSCCO, which in\nsurprising contrast to YBCO revealed completely insulating vortex cores.\n", "  We report experiments on cohesionless granular piles to determine the effect\nof construction history on the static stress distribution. The stresses beneath\nthe piles are monitored using a very sensitive capacitive technique. The piles\nare formed either by release of granular material from a relatively small\noutput (localized source), or from a large diameter sieve (homogeneous rain).\nThe stress profiles resulting from localized source inputs have a clear stress\ndip near the center of the pile while the results from an homogeneous rain show\nno stress dip. We also show that the stress profiles scale simply with the pile\nheight. Experiments on wedges-shaped piles show the same effects but to a\nlesser degree.\n", "  We derive the superconductiong mean-field equations for an attractive\ninteraction, V, in the s-wave channel when local Coulomb interactions are taken\ninto account for any value of U. Our results show that the Coulomb repulsion is\ndetrimental to the critical temperature, $T_c$, and the order parameter,\n$\\Delta(T)$, for values of $U \\geq |V|$. Furthermore, our results depend on\nband filling in a sensible way. In the presence of local correlations,\n$2\\Delta(0)/T_c$ differs from the BCS ratio, since Coulomb interactions affect\nmuch more the superconducting critical temperature, $T_c$, than the\nsuperconducting order parameter, $\\Delta(T)$. We conclude that the presence of\nCoulomb interactions play an additional role in the analysis of experimental\ndata, specially in narrow band systems.\n", "  We have performed ellipsometric measurements of the far-infrared c-axis\ndielectric response of underdoped YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-\\delta}$ single\ncrystals. Here we report a detailed analysis of the temperature-dependent\nrenormalization of the oxygen bending phonon mode at 320 cm$^{-1}$ and the\nformation of the additional absorption peak around 400-500 cm$^{-1}$. For a\nstrongly underdoped YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6.5}$ crystal with T$_{c}$=52 K we\nfind that, in agreement with previous reports based on conventional reflection\nmeasurements, the gradual onset of both features occurs well above T$_{c}$ at\nT*$\\sim $150 K. Contrary to some of these reports, however, our data establish\nthat the phonon anomaly and the formation of the additional peak exhibit very\npronounced and steep changes right at T$_{c}$. For a less underdoped\nYBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6.75}$ crystal with T$_{c}$=80 K, the onset temperature of\nthe phonon anomaly almost coincides with T$_{c}$. Also in contrast to some\nprevious reports, we find for both crystals that a sizeable fraction of the\nspectral weight of the additional absorption peak cannot be accounted for by\nthe spectral-weight loss of the phonon modes but instead arises from a\nredistribution of the electronic continuum. Our ellipsometric data are\nconsistent with a model where the bilayer cuprate compounds are treated as a\nsuperlattice of intra- and inter-bilayer Josephson-junctions.\n", "  A phase diagram is drawn in a parameter space of the nearly half-filled\nsingle band two-dimensional Hubbard model with U/t, t'/t and n as the\nparameters, U, t, t' and n being the on-site interaction, the nearest and\nsecond nearest neighbor transfer matrices and the number of electrons per site,\nrespectively. The parameter space is chosen so as to include the models for the\nhigh-T_c cuprates as well as 2D-organic superconductors. The superconducting\nand antiferromagnetic instability surfaces are drawn from the results of\ncalculations by using the spin fluctuation theory within the fluctuation\nexchange approximation. The metal-insulator transition surface is also\nindicated in the diagram. From this phase diagram we discuss the possibility of\nthe spin fluctuation mechanism being the common origin of the superconductivity\nin the high-T_c cuprates and 2D-organic compounds.\n", "  We study the three-dimensional Anderson model of localization with\nanisotropic hopping, i.e. weakly coupled chains and weakly coupled planes. In\nour extensive numerical study we identify and characterize the metal-insulator\ntransition using energy-level statistics. The values of the critical disorder\n$W_c$ are consistent with results of previous studies, including the\ntransfer-matrix method and multifractal analysis of the wave functions. $W_c$\ndecreases from its isotropic value with a power law as a function of\nanisotropy. Using high accuracy data for large system sizes we estimate the\ncritical exponent $\\nu=1.45\\pm0.2$. This is in agreement with its value in the\nisotropic case and in other models of the orthogonal universality class. The\ncritical level statistics which is independent of the system size at the\ntransition changes from its isotropic form towards the Poisson statistics with\nincreasing anisotropy.\n", "  We present some aspects of the rheology of field-responsive suspensions, a\nclass of field-responsive liquid matter systems possessing the ability to\nundergo significant changes in their strength upon application of an external\nfield. Both the single-particle and the many-particle domains are discussed. In\nthe former, consideration of the full nonlinear dynamics of the particles leads\nto an anomalous behavior of the viscosity whereas in the latter the most\nsalient feature is the formation of chains and fractal structures. We indicate\nhow to deal with the rheology at moderately concentrations leaving open the\nproblem at higher concentrations for which the complexity of the emergent\nstructures strongly limits the knowledge of their dynamics.\n", "  An approximate method to calculate dielectric response and relaxation\nfunctions for water saturated sedimentary rocks is tested for realistic\nthreedimensional pore space images. The test is performed by comparing the\nprediction from the approximate method against the exact solution. The\napproximate method is based on image analysis and local porosity theory. An\nempirical rule for the specification of the length scale in local porosity\ntheory is advanced. The results from the exact solution are compared to those\nobtained using local porosity theory and various other approximate mixing laws.\nThe calculation based on local porosity theory is found to yield improved\nquantitative agreement with the exact result.\n", "  We study the three-dimensional Anderson model of localization with\nanisotropic hopping, i.e., weakly coupled chains and weakly coupled planes. In\nour extensive numerical study we identify and characterize the metal-insulator\ntransition by means of the transfer-matrix method. The values of the critical\ndisorder $W_c$ obtained are consistent with results of previous studies,\nincluding multifractal analysis of the wave functions and energy level\nstatistics. $W_c$ decreases from its isotropic value with a power law as a\nfunction of anisotropy. Using high accuracy data for large system sizes we\nestimate the critical exponent as $\\nu=1.62\\pm0.07$. This is in agreement with\nits value in the isotropic case and in other models of the orthogonal\nuniversality class.\n", "  We compare scaling properties of the cardiac dynamics during sleep and wake\nperiods for healthy individuals, cosmonauts during orbital flight, and subjects\nwith severe heart disease. For all three groups, we find a greater degree of\nanticorrelation in the heartbeat fluctuations during sleep compared to wake\nperiods. The sleep-wake difference in the scaling exponents for the three\ngroups is comparable to the difference between healthy and diseased\nindividuals. The observed scaling differences are not accounted for simply by\ndifferent levels of activity, but appear related to intrinsic changes in the\nneuroautonomic control of the heartbeat.\n", "  We study the spectral width as a function of the external momentum for the\ndynamical structure factor of a disordered harmonic solid, considered as a toy\nmodel for supercooled liquids and glasses. Both in the context of single-link\ncoherent potential approximation and of a single-defect approximation, two\ndifferent regimes are clearly identified: if the density of states at zero\nenergy is zero, the Rayleigh $p^4$ law is recovered for small momentum. On the\ncontrary, if the disorder induces a non vanishing density of states at zero\nenergy, a linear behaviour is obtained. The dynamical structure factor is\nnumerically calculated in lattices as large as $96^3$, and satisfactorily\nagrees with the analytical computations.\n", "  We compute the 2-point (equal-time) electronic Green function in a\nTomonaga-Luttinger system with long-range electron-electron interactions. We\nobtain an analytical expression for a \"super long-range\" potential of the form\n$V(x)=\\frac{e^2d^{-\\epsilon}}{|x|^{1-\\epsilon}}$. As a consistency check of our\ncomputational technique we also consider the particular case of a Coulomb\npotential. Our result confirms the $\\exp-C(logx)^{3/2}$ long-distance behavior\nfirst obtained by Schulz.\n", "  Specific heat measurements down to 0.5 K have been performed on a single\ncrystal sample of a spin-ladder like compound\nCu$_{2}$(C$_{5}$H$_{12}$N$_{2}$)$_{2}$Cl$_{4}$ under magnetic fields up to 12\nT. The temperature dependence of the observed data in a magnetic field below 6\nT is well reproduced by numerical results calculated for the S=1/2 two-leg\nladder with $J_{\\rm{rung}}$/$J_{\\rm{leg}}$=5. In the gapless region above 7 T\n($H_{\\rm{c1}}$), the agreement between experiment and calculation is good above\nabout 2 K and a sharp and a round peak were observed below 2 K in a magnetic\nfield around 10 T, but the numerical data show only a round peak, the magnitude\nof which is smaller than that of the observed one. The origin of the sharp peak\nand the difference between the experimental and numerical round peak are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Ricci and contracted Ricci collineations of the Bianchi type II, VIII, and IX\nspace-times, associated with the vector fields of the form (i) one component of\n$\\xi^a(x^b)$ is different from zero and (ii) two components of $\\xi^a(x^b)$ are\ndifferent from zero, for $a,b=1,2,3,4$, are presented. In subcase (i.b), which\nis $\\xi^a= (0,\\xi^2(x^a),0,0)$, some known solutions are found, and in subcase\n(i.d), which is $\\xi^a =(0,0,0,\\xi^4(x^a))$, choosing $S(t)=const.\\times R(t)$,\nthe Bianchi type II, VIII, and IX space-times is reduced to the\nRobertson-Walker metric.\n", "  We report on the existence and phenomenology of type II critical collapse\nwithin the one-parameter family of SU(2) $\\sigma$-models coupled to gravity.\nNumerical investigations in spherical symmetry show discretely self-similar\n(DSS) behavior at the threshold of black hole formation for values of the\ndimensionless coupling constant $\\ccbeta$ ranging from 0.2 to 100; at 0.18 we\nsee small deviations from DSS. While the echoing period $\\Delta$ of the\ncritical solution rises sharply towards the lower limit of this range, the\ncharacteristic mass scaling has a critical exponent $\\gamma$ which is almost\nindependent of $\\ccbeta$, asymptoting to $0.1185 \\pm 0.0005$ at large\n$\\ccbeta$. We also find critical scaling of the scalar curvature for\nnear-critical initial data. Our numerical results are based on an\noutgoing-null-cone formulation of the Einstein-matter equations, specialized to\nspherical symmetry. Our numerically computed initial-data critical parameters\n$p^*$ show 2nd order convergence with the grid resolution, and after\ncompensating for this variation in $p^*$, our individual evolutions are\nuniformly 2nd order convergent even very close to criticality.\n", "  A new prescription to calculate the total energies and angular momenta of\nasymptotically $(d+1)$-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetimes is proposed. The\nmethod is based on an extension of the field theoretical approach to General\nRelativity to the case where there is an effective cosmological constant. A\n$(d-1)$-form $\\Omega$ is exhibited which, when integrated on asymptotic\n$(d-1)$-dimensional boundary surfaces, yields the values of those conserved\nquantities. The calculations are gauge independent once asymptotic conditions\nare not violated . Total energies and angular momenta of some known solutions\nin four and five dimensions are calculated agreeing with standard results.\n", "  Two families of models of rotating relativistic disks based on Taub-NUT and\nKerr metrics are constructed using the well-known \"displace, cut and reflect\"\nmethod. We find that for disks built from a generic stationary axially\nsymmetric metric the \"sound velocity\", $(pressure/density)^{1/2}$, is equal to\nthe geometric mean of the prograde and retrograde geodesic circular velocities\nof test particles moving on the disk. We also found that for generic disks we\ncan have zones with heat flow. For the two families of models studied the\nboundaries that separate the zones with and without heat flow are not stable\nagainst radial perturbations (ring formation).\n", "  We use exact general solutions for the spatially flat FRW and the anisotropic\nBianchi I cosmologies to show that generically uncoupled scalar fields\ncooperate to make inflation more probable, while the presence of several\ninteracting fields hinders the occurrence of the phenomenon, in accordance with\nprevious results based on particular power-law solutions. Similar conclusions\nare reached in the case of Bianchi VI$_0$ spacetimes, for power-law solutions\nwhich are proved to be attractors.\n", "  The Bardeen model -- the first regular black hole model in General Relativity\n-- is reinterpreted as the gravitational field of a nonlinear magnetic\nmonopole, i.e., as a magnetic solution to Einstein equations coupled to a\nnonlinear electrodynamics.\n", "  We present a general method to obtain static anisotropic spherically\nsymmetric solutions, satisfying a nonlocal equation of state, from known\ndensity profiles. This equation of state describes, at a given point, the\ncomponents of the corresponding energy-momentum tensor not only as a function\nat that point, but as a functional throughout the enclosed configuration. In\norder to establish the physical aceptability of the proposed static family of\nsolutions satisfying nonlocal equation of state,\\textit{}we study the\nconsequences imposed by the junction and energy conditions for anisotropic\nfluids in bounded matter distribution. It is shown that a general relativistic\nspherically symmetric bounded distributions of matter, at least for certain\nregions, could satisfy a nonlocal equation of state.\n", "  We consider the axially symmetric coupled system of gravitation,\nelectromagnetism and a dilaton field. Reducing from four to three dimensions,\nthe system is described by gravity coupled to a non-linear $\\sigma$-model. We\nfind the target space isometries and use them to generate new solutions. It\nseems that it is only possible to generate rotating solutions from non-rotating\nones for the special cases when the dilaton coupling parameter $a=0, \\pm\n\\sqrt{3}$. For those particular values, the target space symmetry is enlarged.\n", "  A simple model for the formation of a straight cosmic string, wiggly or\nunperturbed is considered. The gravitational field of such string is computed\nin the linear approximation. The vacuum expectation value of the stress tensor\nof a massless scalar quantum field coupled to the string gravitational field is\ncomputed to the one loop order. Finally, the back-reaction effect on the\ngravitational field of the string is obtained by solving perturbatively the\nsemiclassical Einstein's equations.\n", "  We discuss photon emission from particles decelerlated by the cosmic\nexpansion. This can be interpretated as a kind of bremsstrahlung induced by the\nUniverse geometry. In the high momentum limit its transition probability does\nnot depend on detailed behavior of the expansion.\n", "  The purpose of this Comment is to show that the solutions to the zero energy\nSchr\\\"odinger equations for monomial central potentials discussed in a recently\npublished Letter, may also be obtained from the corresponding free particle\nsolutions in a straight forwardly way, using an algorithm previously devised by\nus. New solutions to the zero energy Schr\\\"odinger equation are also exhibited.\n", "  We show that in all theories in which black hole hair has been discovered,\nthe region with non-trivial structure of the non-linear matter fields must\nextend beyond $3/ 2$ the horizon radius, independently of all other parameters\npresent in the theory. We argue that this is a universal lower bound that\napplies in every theory where hair is present. This {\\it no short hair\nconjecture} is then put forward as a more modest alternative to the now\ndebunked {\\it no hair conjecture}.\n", "  Three different classes of static solutions of the Einstein--Maxwell\nequations non--minimally coupled to a dilaton field are presented. The\nsolutions are given in general in terms of two arbitrary harmonic functions and\ninvolve among others an arbitrary parameter which determines their\napplicability as charged black holes, dilaton black holes or strings. Most of\nthe known solutions are contained as special cases and can be non--trivially\ngeneralized in different ways.\n", "  The quantization of a real massless scalar field in a spacetime produced in a\ncollision of two electromagnetic plane waves with constant wave fronts is\nconsidered. The background geometry in the interaction region, the\nBell-Szekeres solution, is locally isometric to the conformally flat\nBertotti-Robinson universe filled with a uniform electric field. It is shown\nthat before the waves interact the Bogoliubov coefficients relating different\nobservers are trivial and no vacuum polarization takes place. In the non-\nsingular interaction region neutral scalar particles are produced with number\nof created particles and spectrum typical of gravitational wave collision.\n", "  Some exact solutions for the Einstein field equations corresponding to\ninhomogeneous $G_2$ cosmologies with an exponential-potential scalar field\nwhich generalize solutions obtained previously are considered. Several\nparticular cases are studied and the properties related to generalized\ninflation and asymptotic behaviour of the models are discussed.\n", "  We present a new generating algorithm to construct exact non static solutions\nof the Einstein field equations with two-dimensional inhomogeneity. Infinite\ndimensional families of $G_1$ inhomogeneous solutions with a self interacting\nscalar field, or alternatively with perfect fluid, can be constructed using\nthis algorithm.

We argue that this is a universal lower bound that\napplies in every theory where hair is present. This {\\it no short hair\nconjecture} is then put forward as a more modest alternative to the original\n{\\it no hair conjecture}, the validity of which now seems doubtful.\n", "  Quantum states of the diagonal Bianchi type IX model with negative\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda$ are obtained by transforming the Chern-Simons\nsolution in Ashtekar's variables to the metric representation. We apply our\nmethod developed earlier for $\\Lambda>0$ and obtain five linearly independent\nsolutions by using the complete set of topologically inequivalent integration\ncontours in the required generalized Fourier-transformation. A caustic in\nminisuperspace separates two Euclidean regimes at small and large values of the\nscale parameter from a single classically interpretable Lorentzian regime in\nbetween, corresponding to the fact that classically these model-Universes\nrecollapse. Just one particular solution out of the five we find gives a\nnormalizable probability distribution on both branches of the caustic. However,\nin contrast to the case of positive cosmological constant, this particular\nsolution neither satisfies the semi-classical no-boundary condition, nor does\nthe special initial condition it picks out for $\\hbar \\to 0$ evolve into a\nclassically interpretable Universe.\n", "  A `no-hair' theorem for the Brans-Dicke field, in the domain of outer\ncommunications of a static black hole, is established, when the trace of the\nenergy-momentum tensor, T, is a definite-sign scalar. This implies that\nBrans-Dicke theory of gravitation, for matter with T of definite sign, is\nequivalent to Einstein gravity with the constraint T=0.\n", "  We construct the regularized Wheeler--De Witt operator demanding that the\nalgebra of constraints of quantum gravity is anomaly free. We find that for\nonly a small subset of all wavefunctions being integrals of scalar densities\nthis condition can be satisfied. It turns out that the resulting operator is\nmuch simpler than the one used in \\cite{JK} to find exact solutions of\nWheeler--De Witt equation. We proceed to finding exact solutions of quantum\ngravity and we discuss their interpretation making use of the quantum potential\napproach to quantum theory.\n", "  The form of Maxwell's theory is well known in the framework of general\nrelativity, a fact that is related to the applicability of the principle of\nequivalence to electromagnetic phenomena. We pose the question whether this\nform changes if torsion and/or nonmetricity fields are allowed for in\nspacetime. Starting from the conservation laws of electric charge and magnetic\nflux, we recognize that the Maxwell equations themselves remain the same, but\nthe constitutive law must depend on the metric and, additionally, may depend on\nquantities related to torsion and/or nonmetricity. We illustrate our results by\nputting an electric charge on top of a spherically symmetric exact solution of\nthe metric-affine gauge theory of gravity (comprising torsion and\nnonmetricity). All this is compared to the recent results of Vandyck.\n", "  We have developed a general method for finding apparent horizons in 3D\nnumerical relativity. Instead of solving for the partial differential equation\ndescribing the location of the apparent horizons, we expand the closed 2D\nsurfaces in terms of symmetric trace--free tensors and solve for the expansion\ncoefficients using a minimization procedure. Our method is applied to a number\nof different spacetimes, including numerically constructed spacetimes\ncontaining highly distorted axisymmetric black holes in spherical coordinates,\nand 3D rotating, and colliding black holes in Cartesian coordinates.\n", "  We consider a local cosmic string described by the Abelian-Higgs model in the\nframework of scalar-tensor gravities. We find the metric of the cosmic string\nin the weak-field approximation. The propagation of particles and light is\nanalysed in this background. This analysis shows that the (unperturbed) cosmic\nstring in scalar-tensor theories presents some analogous features to the wiggly\ncosmic string in General Relativity.\n", "  We propose a distinguished set of positive and negative energy modes of the\nKlein-Gordon equation as a time independent definition of the vacuum state of a\nquantized scalar field.\n", "  We consider a classical Dirac field in flat Minkowski spacetime. We perform a\nGordon decomposition of its canonical energy-momentum and spin currents,\nrespectively. Thereby we find for each of these currents a convective and a\npolarization piece. The polarization pieces can be expressed as exterior\ncovariant derivatives of the two-forms $\\check M_\\alpha$ and\n$M_{\\alpha\\beta}=-M_{\\beta\\alpha}$, respectively. In analogy to the magnetic\nmoment in electrodynamics, we identify these two-forms as gravitational moments\nconnected with the translation group and the Lorentz group, respectively. We\npoint out the relation between the Gordon decomposition of the energy-momentum\ncurrent and its Belinfante-Rosenfeld symmetrization. In the non-relativistic\nlimit, the translational gravitational moment of the Dirac field is found to be\nproportional to the spin covector of the electron.\n", "  The canonical theory of (N=1) supergravity, with a matrix representation for\nthe gravitino covector-spinor, is applied to the Bianchi class A spatially\nhomogeneous cosmologies. The full Lorentz constraint and its implications for\nthe wave function of the universe are analyzed in detail. We found that in this\nmodel no physical states other than the trivial \"rest frame\" type occur.\n", "  In this thesis we are interested in the study of the gravitational properties\nof quantum bosonic strings. We start by computing the quantum energy-momentum\ntensor ${\\hat T}^{\\mu\\nu}(x)$ for strings in Minkowski space-time. We perform\nthe calculation of its expectation value for different physical string states\nboth for open and closed bosonic strings. The states we consider are described\nby normalizable wave-packets in the centre of mass coordinates. Amongst our\nresults, we find in particular that ${\\hat T}^{\\mu\\nu}(x)$ becomes a non-local\noperator at the quantum level, its position appears to be smeared out by\nquantum fluctuations. We find that the expectation value acquires a non-zero\nvalue for both massive and massless string states. After computing $<{\\hat\nT}^{\\mu\\nu}(x)>$ we proceed to calculate the gravitational field due to a\nquantum massless bosonic string in the framework of a weak-field approximation\nto Einstein's equations. We obtain a multipole expansion for the weak-field\nmetric $h^{\\mu\\nu}(x)$ and present its gravitational properties, including the\ngravitational radiation produced by such a string. Our results are then\ncompared to those found for classical (cosmic) strings.\n", "  We construct the regularised Wheeler-De Witt operator demanding that the\nalgebra of constraints of quantum gravity is anomaly free. We find that for a\nsubset of all wavefunctions being integrals of scalar densities this condition\ncan be satisfied. We proceed to finding exact solutions of quantum gravity\nbeing of the form of functionals of volume and average curvature of compact\nthree-manifold.\n", "  Rigidly rotating stationary matter in general relativity has been\ninvestigated by Kramer by the Ernst coordinate method. A weakness of this\napproach is that the Ernst potential does not exist for differential rotation.\nWe now generalize the techniques by the use of a nonholonomic and nonrigid\nframe. We apply these techniques for differentially rotating perfect fluids. We\nconstruct a complex analytic tensor, characterizing the class of matter states\nin which both the interior Schwarzschild and the Kerr solution are contained.\nWe derive consistency relations for this class of perfect fluids. We\ninvestigate incompressible fluids characterized by these tensors.\n", "  We generalize the formulation of the colliding gravitational waves to\nmetric-affine theories and present an example of such kind of exact solutions.\nThe plane waves are equipped with five symmetries and the resulting geometry\nafter the collision possesses two spacelike Killing vectors.\n", "  The Bianchi IX mixmaster model is quantized in its non-diagonal form,\nimposing spatial diffeomorphism, time reparametrization and Lorentz invariance\nas constraints on physical state vectors before gauge-fixing. The result turns\nout to be different from quantizing the diagonal model obtained by gauge-fixing\nalready on the classical level. For the non-diagonal model a generalized\n9-dimensional Fourier transformation over a suitably chosen manifold connects\nthe representations in metric variables and in Ashtekar variables. A space of\nfive states in the metric representation is generated from the single physical\nChern-Simons state in Ashtekar variables by choosing five different integration\nmanifolds, which cannot be deformed into each other. For the case of a positive\ncosmological constant $\\Lambda$ we extend our previous study of these five\nstates for the diagonal Bianchi IX model to the non-diagonal case. It is shown\nthat additional discrete (permutation) symmetries of physical states arise in\nthe quantization of the non-diagonal model, which are satisfied by two of the\nfive states connected to the Chern-Simons state. These have the characteristics\nof a wormhole groundstate and a Hartle-Hawking `no-boundary' state,\nrespectively. We also exhibit a special gauge-fixing of the time\nreparametrization invariance of the quantized system and define an associated\nmanifestly positive scalar product. Then the wormhole ground state is left as\nthe only normalizable physical state connected to the Chern-Simons state.\n", "  Above Planck energies, the spacetime might become non--Riemannian, as it is\nknown fron string theory and inflation. Then geometries arise in which\nnonmetricity and torsion appear as field strengths, side by side with\ncurvature. By gauging the affine group, a metric affine gauge theory emerges as\ndynamical framework. Here, by using the harmonic map ansatz, a new class of\nmultipole like solutions in the metric affine gravity theory (MAG) is obtained.\n", "  We present the generalized Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om solution of the field\nequations of metric-affine gravity (MAG), endowed with electric and magnetic\ncharges, as well as with gravito-electric and gravito-magnetic charges and a\ncosmological constant term. Moreover, the case $M=e_o$, i.e. mass equal to\nelectric charge and $\\lambda=0$, corresponds to an electrically and\nmagnetically charged monopole. Also further multipole solutions are obtained.\nThe charge assignments of the solutions is discussed.\n", "  The expression of the vector field generator of a Ricci Collineation for\ndiagonal, spherically symmetric and non-degenerate Ricci tensors is obtained.\nThe resulting expressions show that the time and radial first derivatives of\nthe components of the Ricci tensor can be used to classify the collineation,\nleading to 64 families.\n  Some examples illustrate how to obtain the collineation vector.\n", "  The first regular exact black hole solution in General Relativity is\npresented. The source is a nonlinear electrodynamic field satisfying the weak\nenergy condition, which in the limit of weak field becomes the Maxwell field.\nThe solution corresponds to a charged black hole with |q| \\leq 2 s_c m \\approx\n0.6 m, having the metric, the curvature invariants, and the electric field\nregular everywhere.\n", "  Using the equivalence theorem for the triplet ansatz sector of metric-affine\ngravity (MAG) theories and the Einstein-Proca system, it is shown that the only\nstatic black hole of the triplet sector of MAG is the Schwarzschild solution,\nunder the constraint (-4\\beta_4 + k_1\\beta_5/2k_0 + k_2\\gamma_4/k_0)/\\kappa z_4\n\\neq 0 on the coupling constants. For the special case (-4\\beta_4 +\nk_1\\beta_5/2k_0 + k_2\\gamma_4/k_0)/\\kappa z_4 = 0, it follows that the only\nstatic non-extremal black hole is the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om one. The results can\nbe extended to exclude also the existence of soliton solutions of the triplet\nsector of MAG.\n", "  A non-singular exact black hole solution in General Relativity is presented.\nThe source is a non-linear electromagnetic field, which reduces to the Maxwell\ntheory for weak field. The solution corresponds to a charged black hole with\n|q| \\leq 2s_c m \\approx 0.6 m, having metric, curvature invariants, and\nelectric field bounded everywhere.\n", "  We study, in this paper, curvature inheritance symmetry (CI),\n$\\pounds_{\\xi}R_{bcd}^{a}=2\\alpha R_{bcd}^{a}$, where $\\alpha $ is a scalar\nfunction, for string cloud and string fluid in the context of general\nrelativity. Also, we have obtained some result when a proper CI (i.e., $\\alpha\n\\neq 0$) is also a conformal Killing vector.\n", "  We consider the minimal extension of the Standard Model with three\ngenerations of massive neutrinos that mix. We then determine the parameters of\nthe model that satisfy all experimental constraints.\n", "  A study has been performed of the reaction pbar p -> 4K using in-flight\nantiprotons from 1.1 to 2.0 GeV/c incident momentum interacting with a hydrogen\njet target. The reaction is dominated by the production of a pair of phi\nmesons. The pbar p -> phi phi cross section rises sharply above threshold and\nthen falls continuously as a function of increasing antiproton momentum. The\noverall magnitude of the cross section exceeds expectations from a simple\napplication of the OZI rule by two orders of magnitude. In a fine scan around\nthe xi/f_J(2230) resonance, no structure is observed. A limit is set for the\ndouble branching ratio B(xi -> pbar p) * B(xi -> phi phi) < 6e-5 for a spin 2\nresonance of M = 2.235 GeV and Width = 15 MeV.\n", "  The KARMEN experiment uses the reaction 12C(\\nu_e,e-)12N to measure the\nenergy distribution of \\nu_e emitted in muon decay at rest. The \\nu_e analog\n\\omega_l of the famous Michel parameter \\rho has been derived from a\nmaximum-likelihood analysis of events near the kinematic end point, E_max. The\nresult, \\omega_l = (2.7^{+3.8}_{-3.3}\\pm 3.1) * 10^{-2}, is in good agreement\nwith the standard model prediction \\omega_l= 0. We deduce a 90% confidence\nupper limit of \\omega_l <= 0.113, which corresponds to a limit of |g^S_RL + 2\ng^T_RL| <= 0.78 on the interference term between scalar and tensor coupling\nconstants.\n", "  A Forward Plug Calorimeter (FPC) for the ZEUS detector at HERA has been built\nas a shashlik lead-scintillator calorimeter with wave length shifter fiber\nreadout. Before installation it was tested and calibrated using the X5 test\nbeam facility of the SPS accelerator at CERN. Electron, muon and pion beams in\nthe momentum range of 10 to 100 GeV/c were used. Results of these measurements\nare presented as well as a calibration monitoring system based on a $^{60}$Co\nsource.\n", "  We present results of a high statistics calculation of hadron masses and\nmeson decay constants in the quenched approximation to lattice QCD with Wilson\nquarks at $\\beta=$ 5.85 and 6.0 on $24^3 \\times 54$ lattices. We analyze the\ndata paying attention in particular to the systematic errors due to the choice\nof fitting range and due to the contamination from excited states. We find that\nthe systematic errors for the hadron masses with quarks lighter than the\nstrange quark amount to 1 --- 2 times the statistical errors. When the lattice\nscale is fixed from the $\\rho$ meson mass, the masses of the $\\Omega^{-}$\nbaryon and the $\\phi$ meson at two $\\beta$'s agree with experiment within about\none standard deviation. On the other hand, the central value of the nucleon\nmass at $\\beta=6.0$ (5.85) is larger than its experimental value by about 15\\%\n(20\\%) and that of the $\\Delta$ mass by about 15\\% (4\\%): Even when the\nsystematic errors are included, the baryon masses at $\\beta=6.0$ do not agree\nwith experiment. Vector meson decay constants at two values of $\\beta$ agree\nwell with each other and are consistent with experiment for a wide range of the\nquark mass, when we use current renormalization constants determined\nnonperturbatively by numerical simulations. The pion decay constant agrees with\nexperiment albeit with large errors. Results for the masses of excited states\nof the $\\rho$ meson and the nucleon are also presented.\n", "  The coupled cluster or exp S form of the eigenvalue problem for lattice\nHamiltonian QCD (without quarks) is investigated. A new construction\nprescription is given for the calculation of the relevant coupled cluster\nmatrix elements with respect to an orthogonal and independent loop space basis.\nThe method avoids the explicit introduction of gauge group coupling\ncoefficients by mapping the eigenvalue problem onto a suitable set of character\nfunctions, which allows a simplified procedure. Using appropriate group\ntheoretical methods, we show that it is possible to set up the eigenvalue\nproblem for eigenstates having arbitrary lattice momentum and lattice angular\nmomentum.\n", "  The conservation of the isovector axial current in lattice QCD with massless\nWilson quarks is studied to one-loop order of perturbation theory. Following a\nstrategy described in a previous publication, the O($a$) counterterm required\nfor on-shell improvement of the current is computed. We also confirm an earlier\nresult of Wohlert for the coefficient in front of the SW term in the improved\naction.\n", "  We investigate the performance of the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm, the\nstandard algorithm used for lattice QCD simulations involving fermions, in\nupdating non-trivial global topological structures. We find that the hybrid\nMonte Carlo algorithm has serious problems decorrelating the global topological\ncharge at the values of $\\beta$ and $m$ currently simulated, where continuum\nphysics should be approximately realized. This represents a warning which must\nbe seriously considered when simulating full QCD by hybrid Monte Carlo.\n", "  We study the scaling property of the ratio of the critical temperature $T_c$\nto the square root of the string tension $\\sigma$ in the SU(3) pure gauge\ntheory using a renormalization group improved action. We first determine the\ncritical coupling $\\beta_c$ on lattices with temporal extension $N_t=4$ and 6,\nand then calculate the static quark potential at the critical couplings on\nlattices at zero temperature. The values of $T_{c}/\\sqrt{\\sigma}$ in the\ninfinite volume limit are identical within errors, while they are slightly\nlarger than the value extrapolated to the continuum limit with the standard\naction. We also note that the rotational invariance of the static quark\npotential is remarkably restored in the both cases, and that the potential\n$V(R)$ in physical units scales in the whole region of $R$ investigated.\n", "  We investigate the performance of the hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm in\nupdating non-trivial global topological structures. We find that the hybrid\nMonte Carlo algorithm has serious problems decorrelating the global topological\ncharge. This represents a warning which must be seriously considered when\nsimulating full QCD, regardless of the number and type of fermions, with this\nor any similar algorithm. Simulated tempering is examined as a means of\naccelerating the decorrelation.\n", "  We study the scaling properties of the static quark potential and the ratio\nof the critical temperature $T_c$ to the square root of the string tension\n$\\sigma$ in the SU(3) pure gauge theory using a renormalization group improved\naction. We first determine the critical coupling $\\beta_c$ on lattices with\ntemporal extension $N_t=3$, 4, and 6, and then calculate the static quark\npotential at the critical couplings on lattices at zero temperature. We note\nthat the static quark potentials obtained are rotationally invariant with\nerrors of at most 1 - 2 % in all the three cases, and that the potential $V(R)$\nin physical units scales in the whole region of $R$ investigated. The values of\n$T_{c}/\\sqrt{\\sigma}$ for the three cases in the infinite volume limit are\nidentical within errors. We estimate the value in the continuum limit to be\n$T_{c}/\\sqrt{\\sigma} = 0.656(4)$, which is slightly larger than the value in\nthe continuum limit from the one-plaquette action, 0.629(3).\n", "  We study the geometry of propagation of relativistic fermions. We propose how\nto measure its quantum mechanical length. Numerical lattice results for the\nfree propagator of Dirac-Wilson fermions yield Hausdorff dimension d_H=2 for\nthe unit-matrix component and d_H=1 for any gamma-matrix component. A possible\ngeneralization when matter interacts with radiation is discussed.\n", "  The scaling behavior of fluctuations in cluster size is studied in q=5 and 7\nstate Potts models. This quantity exhibits scaling behavior on small lattices\nwhere the scaling of local operators like energy fluctuations and Binder\ncumulant can not be expected.\n", "  The two-dimensional Potts Model with 2 to 10 states is studied using a\ncluster algorithm to calculate fluctuations in cluster size as well as commonly\nused quantities like equilibrium averages and the histograms for energy and the\norder parameter. Results provide information about the variation of cluster\nsizes depending on the temperature and the number of states. They also give\nevidence for first-order transition when energy and the order parameter related\nmeasurables are inconclusive on small size lattices.\n", "  We present results of a large-scale simulation for the Kaon B parameter $B_K$\nin quenched lattice QCD with the Kogut-Susskind quark action. Calculating $B_K$\nat 1% statistical accuracy for seven values of lattice spacing in the range\n$a\\approx 0.24-0.04$ fm on lattices up to $56^3\\times 96$, we verify a\nquadratic $a$ dependence of $B_K$ theoretically predicted. Strong indications\nare found that, with our level of accuracy, $\\alpha_{\\bar{MS}}(1/a)^2$ terms\narising from our one-loop matching procedure have to be included in the\ncontinuum extrapolation.

Strengths and shortcomings of the method are\ndiscussed and it is argued that the approximation - though being crude - shares\nsome qualitative aspects of full QCD which relate to the issue of chiral\nsymmetry breaking.\n", "  Lepage's improvement scheme is a recent major progress in lattice $QCD$,\nallowing to obtain continuum physics on very coarse lattices. Here we discuss\nimprovement in the Hamiltonian formulation, and we derive an improved\nHamiltonian from a lattice Lagrangian free of $O(a^2)$ errors. We do this by\nthe transfer matrix method, but we also show that the alternative via Legendre\ntransformation gives identical results. We consider classical improvement,\ntadpole improvement and also the structure of L{\\\"u}scher-Weisz improvement.\nThe resulting color-electric energy is an infinite series, which is expected to\nbe rapidly convergent. For the purpose of practical calculations, we construct\na simpler improved Hamiltonian, which includes only nearest-neighbor\ninteractions.\n", "  We present a non-perturbative study of the massive Schwinger model.

We show that the improved\ntheory leads to a significant reduction of the finite lattice spacing errors.\nThe quark condensate and the mass of lightest quark and anti-quark bound state\nin the strong coupling phase (different from t'Hooft phase) are computed. We\nfind agreement between our results and the analytical ones in the continuum.\n", "  We report results of quark masses in quenched lattice QCD with the\nKogut-Susskind fermion action, employing the Reguralization Independent scheme\n(RI) of Martinelli et al. to non-perturbatively evaluate the renormalization\nfactor relating the bare quark mass on the lattice to that in the continuum.\nCalculations are carried out at \\beta=6.0, 6.2, and 6.4, from which we find\n$m^{\\bar{MS}}_{ud} (2 GeV)= 4.23(29) MeV$ for the average up and down quark\nmass and, with the $\\phi$ meson mass as input, $m^{\\bar{MS}}_{s} (2 GeV)=\n129(12) MeV$ for the strange mass in the continuum limit. These values are\nabout 20% larger than those obtained with the one-loop perturbative\nrenormalization factor.\n", "  We present results for I=2 pion scattering length with the Wilson fermions in\nthe quenched approximation. The finite size method presented by L\\\"uscher is\nemployed, and calculations are carried out at $\\beta=5.9$, 6.1, and 6.3. In the\ncontinuum limit, we obtain a result in reasonable agreement with the\nexperimental value.\n", "  In a model with a gauge group $G_{SM}\\otimes U(1)_X$, where $G_{SM} \\equiv\nSU(3)_C \\otimes SU(2)_L \\otimes U(1)_Y$ is the standard model gauge group and\n$U(1)_X$ is a horizontal local gauge symmetry, we propose a radiative\ngeneration of the spectrum of quark masses and mixing angles. The assignment of\nhorizontal charges is such that at tree level only the third family is massive.\nUsing these tree level masses and introducing exotic scalars, the light\nfamilies of quarks acquire hierarchical masses through radiative corrections.\nThe rank three quark mass matrices obtained are written in terms of a minimal\nset of free parameters of the model, whose values are estimated performing a\nnumerical fit. The resulting quark masses and CKM mixing angles turn out to be\nin good agreement with the experimental values.\n", "  We establish from first principles a perturbative framework that allows us to\ncompute reaction rates for processes taking place in nonequilibrium $O (N)$\nlinear-sigma systems in broken phase. The system of our concern is quasiuniform\nsystem near equilibrium or nonequilibrium quasistationary system. We employ the\nclosed-time-path formalism and use the so-called gradient approximation. No\nfurther approximation is introduced. In the course of construction of the\nframework, we obtain the gap equation that determines the effective masses of\n$\\pi$ and of $\\sigma$, and the generalized Boltzmann equation that describes\nthe evolution of the number-density functions of $\\pi$ and of $\\sigma$.\n", "  We study radiative corrections to chargino production at linear colliders\nwith polarised electron beams. We calculate the one-loop corrected\ncross-sections for polarised electon beams due to three families of quarks and\nsquarks, working in the $\\bar{MS}$ scheme, extending our previous calculation\nof the unpolarised cross-section with one-loop corrections due to the third\nfamily of quarks and squarks. In some cases we find rather large corrections to\nthe tree-level cross-sections.

We pay particular attention to\nthe Bethe-Salpeter and Inverse Amplitude unitarization methods and their recent\napplications to $\\pi\\pi$ and $\\pi N$ scattering.\n", "  We first review the current algebra - PCAC approach to nonleptonic octet\nbaryon 14 weak decay B (\\to) (B^{\\prime})(\\pi) amplitudes. The needed four\nparameters are independently determined by (\\Omega \\to \\Xi \\pi),(\\Lambda K) and\n(\\Xi ^{-}\\to \\Sigma ^{-}\\gamma) weak decays in dispersion theory tree order. We\nalso summarize the recent chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) version of the\neight independent B (\\to) (B^{\\prime}\\pi) weak (\\Delta I) = 1/2 amplitudes\ncontaining considerably more than eight low-energy weak constants in one-loop\norder.\n", "  The pieces of the hypernuclear strangeness violating potential due to the\npseudoscalar meson exchanges are derived using methods which were successfully\napplied to hyperon nonleptonic decays. The estimates are tested by comparison\nwith measured hyperon nonleptonic decay amplitudes. All isospin changes $\\Delta\nI=1/2$ and $\\Delta I=3/2$ are included in the derived potential. All\ncalculational methods used are reviewed and described in detail.\n", "  A procedure inspired by the Tamm-Dancoff method is applied to the chiral\nquark model which has been extended to include additional degrees of freedom: a\npseudoscalar isoscalar field as well as a triplet of scalar isovector fields.\nThe simpler, generic $\\sigma$ -- model has been used before as a test for the\nTamm-Dancoff inspired approximation (TDIA). The extended chirial quark model is\nemployed here to investigate possible novel effects of the additional degrees\nof freedom as well as to point out the necessesity to introduce a SU(3)\nflavour. Model predictions for the axial-vector coupling constant and for the\nnucleon magnetic moment obtained in TDIA are compared with experimental values.\n", "  We present precision calculations of the processes e+ e- -> 4-fermions in\nwhich the double resonant W+ W- and ZZ intermediate states occur. Referring to\nthese latter intermediate states as the 'signal processes', we show that, by\nusing the YFS Monte Carlo event generators YFSWW3-1.14 and KoralW-1.42 in an\nappropriate combination, we achieve a physical precision on the WW signal\nprocess, as isolated with LEP2 MC Workshop cuts, below 0.5 per cent. We stress\nthe full gauge invariance of our calculations and we compare our results with\nthose of other authors where appropriate. In particular, sample Monte Carlo\ndata are explicitly illustrated and compared with the results of the program\nRacoonWW of Denner et al. In this way, we cross check that the total (physical\noplus technical) precision tag for the WW signal process cross section is 0.4\nper cent for 200 GeV, for example. Results are also given for 500 GeV with an\neye toward the LC. For the analogous ZZ case, we cross check that our YFSZZ\ncalculation yields a total precision tag of 2 per cent, when it is compared to\nthe results of ZZTO and GENTLE of Passarino and Bardin et al., respectively.\n", "  We show that chiral symmetry is responsible for large cancellations in the\ntwo-pion exchange nucleon-nucleon interaction, which are similar to those\noccuring in free pion-nucleon scattering.\n", "  We argue that the minimal chiral background for the two-pion exchange\nnucleon-nucleon interaction has nowadays a rather firm conceptual basis, which\nentitles it to become a standard ingredient of any modern potential. In order\nto facilitate applications, we present a parametrized version of a\nconfiguration space potential derived previously. We then use it to assess the\nphenomenological contents of some existing NN potentials.\n", "  We consider the small velocity sum rules for heavy flavour semileptonic\ntransitions that are used to estimate the zero recoil values of semileptonic\nheavy flavour form factors. We analyze the complete O($\\alpha _S$) radiative\ncorrection to these sum rules. The corrections are universal and influence all\n\"model-independent\" bounds previously derived for semileptonic form factors at\nzero recoil.\n", "  We study CP violation in the lepton sector in extended models with\nright-handed neutrinos, without and with left-right symmetry, and with\narbitrary mass terms. We find the conditions which must be satisfied by the\nneutrino and charged lepton mass matrices for CP conservation. These\nconstraints, which are independent of the choice of weak basis, are proven to\nbe also sufficient in simple cases. This invariant formulation makes apparent\nthe necessary requirements for CP violation, as well as the size of CP\nviolating effects. As an example, we show that CP violation can be much larger\nin left-right symmetric models than in models with only additional right-handed\nneutrinos, {\\it i.e.}, without right-handed currents.\n", "  The weak dipole moments of leptons and quarks, \\ie those related to their\n$Z$--coupling, are reviewed. Standard Model predictions and experimental\nresults may result in a stringent test for both their pointlike structure and\nalso for the Standard Model. Special attention is devoted to the anomalous\nweak--magnetic dipole moment and to the $CP$--violating weak--electric dipole\nmoment.\n", "  We investigate the nucleon to Delta(1232) vector and axial vector amplitudes\nin the non-relativistic quark model of the Isgur-Karl variety. A particular\ninterest is to investigate the SU(6) symmetry breaking, due to color hyperfine\ninteraction. We compare the theoretical estimates to recent experimental\ninvestigation of the Adler amplitudes by neutrino scattering.\n", "  This note is devoted to the calculation of the two-loop $O(G_F {M_H}^2)$\nradiative corrections to the Higgs decay width $H \\to \\gamma \\gamma $ for large\nvalues of the Higgs boson mass $M_H$ within the Minimal Standard Model.\n  The use of the Equivalence Theorem makes it possible to reduce the problem to\nthe consideration of the physical Higgs boson field and the Goldstone bosons\n$w^{+},w^{-},z$. We present analytical results for the various two- and\nthree-particle absorptive parts of two-loop contributions, using dispersive\ntechniques, analytic results for all but one of the dispersive contributions.\nThe typical size of the correction is $\\sim ~30 $ percent for a Higgs boson\nmass of order $1~TeV$.\n", "  We present the BFKL equation as a reggeon Bethe-Salpeter equation and discuss\nthe use of reggeon diagrams to obtain 2-2 and 2-4 reggeon interactions at\n$O(g^4)$. We then outline the dispersion theory basis of multiparticle\n$j$-plane analysis and describe how a gauge theory can be studied by combining\nWard identity constraints with the group structure of reggeon interactions. The\nderivation of gluon reggeization, the $O(g^2)$ BFKL kernel, and $O(g^4)$\ncorrections, is described within this formalism. We give an explicit expression\nfor the $O(g^4)$ forward ``parton'' kernel in terms of logarithms and evaluate\nthe eigenvalues. A separately infra-red finite component with a holomorphically\nfactorizable spectrum is shown to be present and conjectured to be a new\nleading-order partial-wave amplitude. A comparison is made with Kirschner's\ndiscussion of $O(g^4)$ contributions from the multi-Regge effective action.\n", "  We calculate the energy and hydrostatic pressure densities of a hot\nquark-gluon plasma in thermal equilibrium through diagrammatic analyses of the\nstatistical average, $\\langle \\Theta_{\\mu \\nu} \\rangle$, of the\nenergy-momentum-tensor operator $\\Theta_{\\mu \\nu}$. To leading order at high\ntemperature, the energy density of the long wave length modes is consistently\nextracted by applying the hard-thermal-loop resummation scheme to the\noperator-inserted no-leg thermal amplitudes $\\langle \\Theta_{\\mu \\nu} \\rangle$.\nWe find that, for the long wave length gluons, the energy density, being\npositive, is tremendously enhanced as compared to the noninteracting case,\nwhile, for the quarks, no noticeable deviation from the noninteracting case is\nfound.\n", "  In two-photon collisions at LEP2 and a future $e^+e^-$ linear collider heavy\nquarks (mainly charm) will be pair-produced rather copiously. The production\nvia direct and resolved photons can be distinguished experimentally via a\nremnant-jet tag. We study correlations of the heavy quarks at next-to-leading\norder in QCD in the direct channel, which is free from phenomenological parton\ndensities in the photon. These correlations are therefore directly calculable\nin perturbative QCD and provide a stringent test of the production mechanism.\n", "  The next-to-leading-order (NLO) cross section for the production of heavy\nquarks at large transverse momenta ($p_\\perp$) in $\\gamma\\gamma$ collisions is\ncalculated with perturbative fragmentation functions (PFF's). This approach\nallows for a resummation of terms $\\propto\\alpha_s\\ln(p_\\perp^2/m^2)$ which\narise in NLO from collinear emission of gluons by heavy quarks at large\n$p_\\perp$ or from almost collinear branching of photons or gluons into\nheavy-quark pairs. We present single-inclusive distributions in $p_\\perp$ and\nrapidity including direct and resolved photons for $\\gamma\\gamma$ production of\nheavy quarks at $e^+e^-$ colliders and at high-energy $\\gamma\\gamma$ colliders.\nThe results are compared with the fixed-order calculation for $m$ finite\nincluding QCD radiative corrections. The two approaches differ in the\ndefinitions and relative contributions of the direct and resolved terms, but\nessentially agree in their sum. The resummation of the $\\alpha_s\n\\ln(p_\\perp^2/m^2)$ terms in the PFF approach leads to a softer $p_\\perp$\ndistribution and to a reduced sensitivity to the choice of the renormalization\nand factorization scales.\n", "  The Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model (NJL) is extended to incorporate heavy quark\nspin-symmetry. In this model baryons containing one heavy quark are analyzed as\nbound-states of light baryons, represented as chiral solitons, and mesons\ncontaining one heavy quark. From related studies in Skyrme type models, the\nground-state heavy baryon is known to arise for the heavy meson in a P--wave\nconfiguration. In the limit of an infinitely large quark mass the heavy meson\nwave-function is sharply peaked at the center of the chiral soliton. Therefore\nthe bound state equation reduces to an eigenvalue problem for the coefficients\nof the operators contained in the most general P-wave {\\it ansatz} for the\nheavy meson. Within the NJL model a novel feature arises from the coupling of\nthe heavy meson to the various light quark states. In this respect conceptual\ndifferences to Skyrme model calculations are discovered: The strongest bound\nstate is given by a heavy meson configuration which is completely decoupled\nfrom the grand spin zero channel of the light quarks.\n", "  We study off-shell effects of the pion cloud on the sea quark distribution in\nthe nucleon. The structure function of the off-mass-shell pion is obtained\nwithin the Nambu and Jona-Lasinio model, where the shape of the distribution\nfunction depends on the pion momentum. By using the momentum dependent pion\nstructure function, the SU(2) flavor asymmetry in the nucleon see is reexamined\nwithin the pionic model, in which the sea quark distribution of the nucleon is\ngiven as a convolution of the off-shell pion structure function. We calculate\nexperimentally observed quantities related to the SU(2) asymmetry of the\nnucleon sea such as the Gottfried sum and the Drell-Yan cross section ratios,\nand find these quantities are insensitive to the off-shell effects of the pions\nstructure function. However, the $x$ dependence of $\\bar{u}-\\bar{d}$ calculated\nwith the off-shell structure function shows a clear deviation from the result\nwith the on-shell one. We evaluate also the cross section of semi-inclusive\nlepton-nucleon process with a slow nucleon production to demonstrate the\noff-shell effect to be checked experimentally.\n", "  We investigate the astrophysical and cosmological implications of the\nrecently proposed idea of a running gravitational coupling on macroscopic\nscales. We find that when applied to the rotation curves of galaxies, their\nflatness requires still the presence of dark matter. Bounds on the variation of\nthe gravitational coupling from primordial nucleosynthesis, change of the\nperiod of binary pulsars, gravitational lensing and the cosmic virial theorem\nare analysed.\n", "  The finite temperature and finite density dependence of the neutron-proton\nmass difference is analysed in a purely hadronic framework where the\n$\\rho-\\omega $ mixing is crucial for this isospin symmetry breakdown. The\nproblem is handled within Thermo Field Dynamics. The present results,\nconsistent with partial chiral and charge symmetry restoration, improve the\nexperimental data fit for the energy difference between mirror nuclei.\n", "  We report on a lattice QCD calculation of the $\\pi N \\sigma$ term, the scalar\nform factor, and $\\langle N|\\bar{s}s|N\\rangle$. The disconnected insertion part\nof $\\sg$ is found to be $1.8 \\pm 0.1$ times larger than the connected insertion\ncontribution. The $q^2$ dependence of $\\sg(q^2)$ is about the same as\n$G_E(q^2)$ of the proton so that $\\sg(2m_{\\pi}^2) - \\sg(0) = 6.6 \\pm 0.6$ MeV.\nThe ratio $y= \\ss/\\ud = 0.36 \\pm 0.03$. Both results favor a $\\sg \\sim 53$ MeV,\nslightly larger than our direct calculation of $\\sg = 49.7 \\pm 2.6$ MeV. We\nalso compute $F_s$ and $D_s$ and find that the agreement with those from the\noctect baryon mass splittings crucially depends on the inclusion of the large\ndisconnected insertion. Finally, we give our result for the $K N \\sigma$ term.\n", "  We have computed semi-inclusive spin asymmetries for proton and deuteron\ntargets including next to leading order (NLO) QCD corrections and contributions\ncoming from the target fragmentation region. These corrections have been\nestimated using NLO fragmentation functions, parton distributions and also a\nmodel for spin dependent fracture functions which is proposed here. We have\nfound that NLO corrections are small but non-negligible in a scheme where\ngluons are polarised and that our estimate for target fragmentation effects\ndoes not modify significantly charged asymmetries but affects the so called\ndifference asymmetries.\n", "  We study the high energy behaviour of fermions hitting a general wall caused\nby a first-order phase transition. The wall profile is introduced through a\ngeneral analytic function. The reflection coefficient is computed in the high\nenergy limit and expressed in terms of the poles of the wall profile function.\nIt is shown that the leading singularity gives the high energy behaviour.\n", "  Neutrino oscillations in the presence of strong gravitational fields are\nstudied. We look at very high energy neutrinos ($\\sim $1 TeV) emanating from\nActive Galactic Nuclei (AGN). It is observed that spin flavor resonant\ntransitions of such neutrinos may occur in the vicinity of AGN due to {\\it\ngravitational} effects and due to the presence of a large magnetic field ($\\sim\n$1 Tesla). A point to note is that matter effects (normal MSW transitions)\nbecome negligible in comparison o gravitational effects in our scenario.\n", "  We present the first evaluation of color dipole cross section from\nexperimental data on diffractive photo- and electroproduction of vector mesons.\nThe dipole-size and energy dependence of the found dipole cross section is\nconsistent with expectations from the BFKL dynamics.\n", "  We present the color dipole phenomenology of diffractive photo- and\nelectroproduction $\\gamma^{*} N\\to V(V') N$ of vector mesons ($V(1S) = \\phi^0,\n\\omega^0, \\rho^0, J/\\Psi, \\Upsilon$) and their radial excitations ($V'(2S) =\n\\phi', \\omega', \\rho', \\Psi', \\Upsilon'$). The main emphasis is related to\nlight vector mesons. We discuss how the energy dependence of the color dipole\ncross section in conjuction with the node of the radial wave function of the\n$2S$ states can lead to an anomalous $Q^2$ and energy dependence of diffractive\nproduction of $V'(2S)$ vector mesons. The color dipole model predictions for\n$V(1S)$ light vector meson production are compared with the experimental data\nfrom the EMC, NMC, ZEUS and H1 collaborations.\n", "  The semi-analytical approach to the model independent leptonic QED\ncorrections to exclusive $\\rho^0$ meson leptoproduction (i.e. electron and muon\nscattering experiments) is presented. The corrections to $\\rho^0$ production at\nlarge $Q^2$ as well as to $\\rho^0$ photoproduction are studied in details. The\nnumerical results are calculated for two different experimental analyses: NMC\n(muoproduction at large $Q^2$) and ZEUS at HERA (photoproduction). It is shown\nthat the corrections are 2-5 \\% for NMC and below 2 \\% for the ZEUS\nmeasurement. The application of the presented approach to other vector mesons\nproduction is straightforward.\n", "  We use a chiral random matrix model with 2N_f flavors to mock up the QCD\nDirac spectrum at finite chemical potential. We show that the 1/N approximation\nbreaks down in the quenched state with spontaneously broken chiral symmetry.\nThe breakdown condition is set by the divergence of a two-point function, that\nis shown to follow the general lore of macroscopic universality. In this state,\nthe fermionic fluctuations are not suppressed in the large N limit.\n", "  We investigate the possibility of studying E$_6$ phenomenology at high energy\nhadron colliders. The production of heavy leptons pairs {\\it via} a gluon-gluon\nfusion mechanism is discussed. An enhancement in the parton level cross-section\nis expected due to the heavy (s)fermion loops which couple to the gluons.\n", "  We study topological defects arising in the Grand Unification Model\n$SU(6)_L\\otimes SU(6)_c \\otimes SU(6)_R \\times Z_3$. We show that the model\ndoes not contain domain walls, while it produces massive magnetic monopoles and\nit may, depending on the symmetry breaking chain, give rise to the formation of\nstrings. We also discuss their possible relation$ the origin of the highest\nenergy cosmic rays detected.\n", "  The possibility of studying superstring inspired \\mbox{${\\rm E}_6$}\nphenomenology at high energy hadron colliders is investigated. A very simple\nlow energy rank-5 Supersymmetric (N=1) model is considered, which consists of\nthree scalar-Higgses, $H^0_{i=1,2,3}\\,$, two charged-Higgses, $H^\\pm\\,$, one\npseudo-scalar-Higgses, $P^0\\,$, and an extra vector boson, the $Z^\\prime$. The\nproduction of charged heavy leptons pairs, $L^+L^-\\,$, by gluon-gluon fusion\nand Drell-Yan mechanisms is discussed. For gluon-gluon fusion an enhancement in\nthe parton level cross-section is expected due to the heavy (s)fermion loops\nwhich couple to the gluons. This mechanism is expected to dominate over\nDrell-Yan for $L^+L^-$ invariant masses above the $Z^\\prime$ mass.\n", "  Recent experiment proposed to observe induced radiative neutrino transitions\nare confronted to existing bounds on neutrino magnetic moments from earth-based\nexperiments. These are found to exclude any observation by several orders of\nmagnitude, unless the magnetic moments are assumed to be strongly momentum\ndependent. This possibility is discussed in some generality, and we find that\nnontrivial dependence of the neutrino form factor may indeed occur, leading to\nquite unexpected effects, although this is insufficient by orders of magnitude\nto justify the experiments.\n", "  We show that a scale invariant approximation to the next-to-leading order\nBFKL kernel, constructed via transverse momentum diagrams, has a simple\nconformally invariant representation in impact parameter space i.e.\nK(r1,r2,r1',r2') = g^4 N^2 ln^4[(|r1-r1'||r2-r2'|)/(|r1-r2'||r2-r1'|)] That a\nconformally invariant representation exists is shown first by relating the\nkernel directly to Feynman diagrams contributing to two photon diffractive\ndissociation.\n", "  Using the CLEO data for $b\\to s\\gamma$, we constrain the chromomagnetic\ndipole moment of the top quark within the context of a decoupling effective\nLagrangian approach. Our results are in agreement with the results obtained for\nthe $e^+e^-$ and hadron colliders.\n", "  We study the high energy behaviour of fermions hitting a general wall caused\nby a first-order phase transition. The wall profile is introduced through\ngeneral analytic and non-analytic functions. The reflection coefficient is\ncomputed in the high energy limit and its connection with the analytic\nproperties of the wall profile function is shown. The high energy behaviour of\nthe fermions hitting the wall is determined either by the leading singularity,\ni.e. the closest pole to the real axis, when the profile function is analytic,\nor by the first non-continuous derivative on the real axis, in the non-analytic\ncase. CP-violating wall profiles are studied and it is shown that the\nrespective symmetry properties of the CP-conserving and CP-violating profile\nfunctions plays an important role on the size of the CP asymmetry.\n", "  The conformal algebra provides powerful constraints, which guarantee that\nrenormalized conformally covariant operators exist in the hypothetical\nconformal limit of the theory, where the $\\beta$-function vanishes. Thus, in\nthis limit also the conformally covariant operator product expansion on the\nlight cone holds true. This operator product expansion has predictive power for\ntwo-photon processes in the generalized Bjorken region. Only the Wilson\ncoefficients and the anomalous dimensions that are known from deep inelastic\nscattering are required for the prediction of all other two-photon processes in\nterms of the process-dependent off-diagonal expectation values of conformal\noperators. It is checked that the next-to-leading order calculations for the\nflavour non-singlet meson transition form factors are consistent with the\ncorrections to the corresponding Wilson coefficients in deep inelasitic\nscattering.\n", "  We compute the dispersion curves for neutrinos propagating in an extremely\ndense electroweak plasma, in the presence of very strong magnetic fields of\norder $B \\le M_W^2/e$. The neutrino self-energy is calculated in the one-loop\napproximation. We consider only contributions of the first Landau level to the\npropagator of the W-bosons, and distinguish between motion parallel or\nperpendicular to the external magnetic field. We find that the neutrino\ndispersion curve for parallel propagation to the field suggests a superfluid\nbehavior. An interesting analogy with fractional QHE is pointed out. We obtain\na neutrino effective mass which increases with the magnetic field.\n", "  Results obtained by the ZEUS collaboration on leading baryon production in\nthe proton fragmentation region are presented. The reaction $\\gamma p \\to N X$,\nwith N a proton or a neutron, is examined both at low and high photon\nvirtuality.\n", "  We review the consequences of spontaneously broken R-parity in present and\nplanned lepton-lepton colliders. In the left-right models the R-parity,\n$R=(-1)^{3(B-L)+2S}$, is preserved due to the gauge symmetry, but it must be\nspontaneously broken in order to the scalar spectrum to be physically\nconsistent. The spontaneous breaking is generated via a non-vanishing VEV of at\nleast one of the sneutrinos, which necessarily means non-conservation of lepton\nnumber $L$. The R-parity violating couplings are parametrized in terms of\nmixing angles, whose values depend on model parameters. Combined with the\nconstraints derived from low-energy measurements this yields allowed ranges for\nvarious R-parity breaking couplings. The R-parity breaking allows for the\nprocesses in which a single chargino or neutralino is produced, subsequently\ndecaying at the interaction point to non-supersymmetric particles.\n", "  We present an implementation of the Bose - Einstein effect in a Monte Carlo\ngenerator for $W^-W^+ $ production in the $e^-e^+$ annihilation by means of the\nweight method. We check that the shift of the W mass in four jet events due to\nthis effect is similarly small as for the other prescription used recently by\nJadach and Zalewski. Possible generalization of this result is shortly\ndiscussed.\n", "  Triangular mass matrices for neutrinos and their charged partners contain\nfull information on neutrino mixing in a most concise form. Although the scheme\nis general and model independent, triangular matrices are typical for reducible\nbut indecomposable representations of graded Lie algebras which, in turn, are\ncharacteristic for the standard model in noncommutative geometry. The mixing\nmatrix responsible for neutrino oscillations is worked out analytically for two\nand three lepton families. The example of two families fixes the mixing angle\nto just about what is required by the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein resonance\noscillation of solar neutrinos. In the case of three families we classify all\nphysically plausible choices for the neutrino mass matrix and derive\ninteresting bounds on some of the moduli of the mixing matrix.\n", "  This is a comprehensive review on the perturbative hot QCD including the\nrecent developments. The main body of the review is concentrated upon dealing\nwith physical quantities like reaction rates.\n  Contents: \\S1. Introduction, \\S2. Perturbative thermal field theory: Feynman\nrules, \\S3. Reaction-rate formula, \\S4. Hard-thermal-loop resummation scheme in\nhot QCD, \\S5. Effective action, \\S6. Hard modes with $|P^2| \\leq O (g^2 T^2)$,\n\\S7. Application to the computation of physical quantities, \\S8. Beyond the\nhard-thermal-loop resummation scheme, \\S9. Conclusions.\n", "  A complete derivation, from first principles, of the reaction-rate formula\nfor a generic process taking place in a heat bath of finite volume is given. It\nis shown that the formula involves no finite-volume correction. Through\nperturbative diagrammatic analysis of the resultant formula, the\ndetailed-balance formula is derived. The zero-temperature limit of the formula\nis discussed. Thermal cutting rules, which are introduced in previous work, are\ncompared with those introduced by other authors.\n", "  Analyzing the dilepton production from out of equilibrium quark-gluon plasma,\nLe Bellac and Mabilat have recently pointed out that, in the reaction rate, the\ncancellation of mass (collinear) singularities takes place only in physical\ngauges, and not in covariant gauges. They then have estimated the contribution\ninvolving pinching singularities. After giving a general argument for the gauge\nindependence of the production rate, we explicitly confirm the gauge\nindependence of the mass-singular part. The contribution involving pinching\nsingularities develops mass singularities, which is also gauge dependent. This\n`` additional'' contribution to the singular part is responsible for the gauge\nindependence of the `` total'' singular part. We give a sufficient condition,\nunder which cancellation of mass singularities takes place.\n", "  We analyze sum rules for the $\\Upsilon$ system with resummation of threshold\neffects on the basis of the nonrelativistic Coulomb approximation. We find for\nthe pole mass of the bottom quark $m_b=4.75\\pm 0.04 GeV$ and for the strong\ncoupling constant $\\al_s(M_Z)=0.118\\pm 0.006$. The origin of the contradiction\nbetween two recent estimates obtained within the same formal framework is\nclarified.\n", "  We discuss the gauge parameter dependence of particle spectra in statistical\nquantum electrodynamics and conclude that the electron spectrum is\ngauge-parameter dependent. The physical spectrum being obtained in the Landau\ngauge, which leads to gauge invariance in a restricted class of gauge\ntransformations.\n", "  We reexamine the scenario of homogeneous nucleation of the quark-gluon plasma\nproduced in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. A generalization of the\nstandard nucleation theory to rapidly expanding system is proposed. The\nnucleation rate is derived via the new scaling parameter $\\lambda_Z$. It is\nshown that the size distribution of hadronic clusters plays an important role\nin the dynamics of the phase transition. The longitudinally expanding system is\nsupercooled to about 3-6%, then it is reheated, and the hadronization is\ncompleted within 6-10 fm/c, i.e. 5-10 times faster than it was estimated\nearlier, in a strongly nonequilibrium way.\n", "  Charginos $\\chi_1^\\pm$ are expected to be the lightest observable\nsupersymmetric particles in many supersymmetric models. We present a procedure\nwhich will allow to determine the chargino mixing angles and, subsequently, the\nfundamental SUSY parameters $M_2, \\mu$ and $\\tan\\beta$ by measurements of the\ntotal cross section and the spin correlations in $e^+e^-$ annihilation to\n$\\chi_1^+ \\chi_1^-$ chargino pairs.\n", "  A model independent analysis of the most recent averages of precision\nelectroweak data from LEP and SLD finds a 3$\\sigma$ deviation of the parameter\n$A_b$ from the Standard Model prediction.\n  The fitted value of $m_H$ shows a strong dependence on the inclusion or\nexclusion of b quark data, and the Standard Model fits have poor confidence\nlevels of a few percent when the latter are included.\n  The good fits obtained to lepton data, c quark data and the directly measured\ntop quark mass, give $m_t = 171.2_{-3.8}^{+3.7}$ GeV and indicate that the\nHiggs boson mass is most likely less than 200 GeV.\n", "  We estimate the perturbative nuclear shadowing in the nuclear structure\nfunction $F_2^A(x,Q^2)$, mainly at the kinematic region of HERA using the\nGlauber-Mueller approach. The contributions of the quark and gluon sectors to\nthe nuclear shadowing are estimated. We predict that the nuclear shadowing\ncorrections are important and that saturation of the ratio $R_1 =\nF_2^{A}(x,Q^2)/A F^p_2(x,Q^2)$ occurs once the shadowing in the gluon sector is\nconsidered.\n", "  This paper has been withdrawn by the authors, and instead we have replaced\nhep-ph/9807214 by this new version.\n", "  Our goal is the study of color effects on the $J/\\psi$ and $D$ mesons\nproduction, as well as the study of their elastic production. We use the Color\nEvaporation Model (CEM), where a single factor takes into account the\nprobability that the $c\\bar{c}$ produced in a color octet state turns into a\nphysical (colorless) quarkonium or continues as a color octet, producing open\ncharm.\n  The main result of this work, besides investigating the range of\napplicability of the CEM, is to show that this model can be used to describe\nthe elastic processes of $J/\\psi$ and open charm photoproduction without the\nuse of a Pomeron.\n", "  In this paper a calculation for the diffractive structure functions\n$F_{L}^{D(4)}$ and $F_{T}^{D(4)}$ using an eikonal approximation is presented.\nA modified version of the model of the stochastic vacuum that includes an\nenergy dependence is used to calculate the scattering amplitude of two Wilson\nloops which in our approach describe the color dipole interaction. Numerical\nresults are presented in the $\\beta$ region where the non-perturbative effects\nare expected to be large. The DIS diffractive cross section is also discussed.\nOur calculation for the diffractive slope in $t$ is in good agreement with the\nexperiment.\n", "  We study the sensitivity of the process e^+ e^- \\to \\nu\\bar{\\nu}\\gamma to\nextra gauge bosons, particularly W' bosons. Depending on the model, evidence\nfor extra W bosons in this process can be detected for W' masses up to several\nTeV.\n", "  We determine the time evolution of the colour screening mass in high energy\nnuclear collisions, as provided by the parton cascade model. Using our result,\nwe discuss the onset of deconfinement and the onset of quarkonium suppression\nin a general, not necessarily equilibrated environment of strongly interacting\nconstituents.\n", "  The variational principle for the special and general relativistic\nhydrodynamics are discussed in view of its application to obtain approximate\nsolutions to these problems. We show that effective Lagrangians can be obtained\nfor suitable ansatz for the dynamical variables such as density profile of the\nsystem. As an example, the relativistic version of spherical droplet motion\n(Rayleigh-Plesset equation) is derived from a simple Lagrangian. For the\ngeneral relativistic case the most general Lagrangian for spherically symmetric\nsystems is given.\n", "  The new contributions to the charmless B decay $B \\to X_{s}\\eta^{\\prime}$\nfrom the unit-charged technipions $P^{\\pm}$ and $P^{\\pm}_{8}$ are estimated.\nThe technipions can provide a large enhancement to the inclusive branching\nratio: $Br(B \\to X_{s}\\eta^{\\prime}) \\sim 7\\times 10^{-4}$ for $m_{p1}=100GeV$\nand $m_{p8}=250 \\sim 350 GeV$ when the effect of QCD gluon anomaly is also\ntaken into account. The new physics effect is essential to interpret the CLEO\ndata.\n", "  We study the possibility of detecting the charged Higgs bosons predicted in\nthe Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model $(H^\\pm)$, with the reactions\n$e^{+}e^{-}\\to \\tau^-\\bar \\nu_{\\tau}H^+, \\tau^+\\nu_\\tau H^-$, using the\nhelicity formalism. We analyze the region of parameter space\n$(m_{A^0}-\\tan\\beta)$ where $H^\\pm$ could be detected in the limit when\n$\\tan\\beta$ is large. The numerical computation is done for the energie which\nis expected to be available at LEP-II ($\\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV) and for a possible\nNext Linear $e^{+}e^{-}$ Collider ($\\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV).\n", "  Vacuum polarization in external fields is treated by way of calculating -\nexactly and then perturbatively - the phase of the quantum scattering matrix in\nthe Shale-Stinespring approach to field theory. The link between the\nShale-Stinespring method and the Epstein-Glaser renormalization procedure is\nhighlighted.\n", "  A method is presented for the computation of the one-loop effective action at\nfinite temperature and density. The method is based on an expansion in the\nnumber of spatial covariant derivatives. It applies to general background field\nconfigurations with arbitrary internal symmetry group and space-time\ndependence. Full invariance under small and large gauge transformations is\npreserved without assuming stationary or Abelian fields nor fixing the gauge.\nThe method is applied to the computation of the effective action of spin zero\nparticles in 2+1 dimensions at finite temperature and density and in presence\nof background gauge fields. The calculation is carried out through second order\nin the number of spatial covariant derivatives. Some limiting cases are worked\nout.\n", "  The calculation of absorption cross sections for minimal scalars in\nsupergravity backgrounds is an important aspect of the investigation of AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence and requires a matching of appropriate wave functions. The low\nenergy case has attracted particular attention. In the following the dependence\nof the cross section on the matching point is investigated. It is shown that\nthe low energy limit is independent of the matching point and hence exhibits\nuniversality. In the high energy limit the independence is not maintained, but\nthe result is believed to possess the correct energy dependence.\n", "  The functional relation between interquark potential and interquark distance\nis explicitly derived by considering the Nambu--Goto action in the $AdS_5\n\\times S^5$ background. It is also shown that a similar relation holds in a\ngeneral background. The implications of this relation for confinement are\nbriefly discussed.\n", "  We consider the vacuum energy for a scalar field subject to a frequency\ndependent boundary condition. The effect of a frequency cut-off is described in\nterms of an {\\it incomplete} $\\zeta$-function. The use of the Debye asymptotic\nexpansion for Bessel functions allows to determine the dominant (volume, area,\n>...) terms in the Casimir energy. The possible interest of this kind of models\nfor dielectric media (and its application to sonoluminescence) is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  The symmetries of the general Euler equations of fluid dynamics with\npolytropic exponent are determined using the Kaluza-Klein type framework of\nDuval et $\\it{al}$. In the standard polytropic case the recent results of\nO'Raifeartaigh and Sreedhar are confirmed and generalized. Similar results are\nproved for polytropic exponent $\\gamma=-1$, which corresponds to the\ndimensional reduction of $d$-branes. The relation between the duality\ntransformation used in describing supernova explosion and Cosmology is\nexplained.\n", "  We study the way Lorentz covariance can be reconstructed from Matrix Theory\nas a IMF description of M-theory. The problem is actually related to the\ninterplay between a non abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action and Super-Yang-Mills\nas its generalized non-relativistic approximation. All this physics shows up by\nmeans of an analysis of the asymptotic expansion of the Bessel functions\n$K_\\nu$ that profusely appear in the computations of amplitudes at finite\ntemperature and solitonic calculations. We hope this might help to better\nunderstand the issue of getting a Lorentz covariant formulation in relation\nwith the $N\\to +\\infty$ limit. There are also some computations that could be\nof some interest in Relativistic Statistical Mechanics.\n", "  The star product technique translates the framework of local fields on\nnoncommutative space-time into nonlocal fields on standard space-time. We\nconsider the example of fields on $\\kappa$- deformed Minkowski space,\ntransforming under $\\kappa$-deformed Poincar\\'{e} group with noncommutative\nparameters. By extending the star product to the tensor product of functions on\n$\\kappa$-deformed Minkowski space and $\\kappa$-deformed Poincar\\'{e} group we\nrepresent the algebra of noncommutative parameters of deformed relativistic\nsymmetries by functions on classical Poincar\\'{e} group.\n", "  We develop a systematic perturbative expansion and compute the one-loop\ntwo-points, three-points and four-points correlation functions in a\nnon-commutative version of the U(N) Wess-Zumino-Witten model in different\nregimes of the $\\theta$-parameter showing in the first case a kind of phase\ntransition around the value $\\theta_c = \\frac{\\sqrt{p^2 + 4 m^2}}{\\Lambda^2\np}$, where $\\Lambda$ is a ultraviolet cut-off in a Schwinger regularization\nscheme. As a by-product we obtain the functions of the renormalization group,\nshowing they are essentially the same as in the commutative case but applied to\nthe whole U(N) fields; in particular there exists a critical point where they\nare null, in agreement with a recent background field computation of the\nbeta-function, and the anomalous dimension of the Lie algebra-valued field\noperator agrees with the current algebra prediction. The non-renormalization of\nthe level $k$ is explicitly verified from the four-points correlator, where a\nleft-right non-invariant counter-term is needed to render finite the theory,\nthat it is however null on-shell. These results give support to the equivalence\nof this model with the commutative one.\n", "  We extend a non local and non covariant version of the Thirring model in\norder to describe a many-body system with spin-flipping interactions By\nintroducing a model with two fermion species we are able to avoid the use of\nnon abelian bosonization which is needed in a previous approach. We obtain a\nbosonized expression for the partition function, describing the dynamics of the\ncollective modes of this system. By using the self-consistent harmonic\napproximation we found a formula for the gap of the spin-charge excitations as\nfunctional of arbitrary electron-electron potentials.\n", "  A notion of effective gauge fields which does not involve a background metric\nis introduced. The role of scale is played by cellular decompositions of the\nbase manifold. Once a cellular decomposition is chosen, the corresponding space\nof effective gauge fields is the space of flat connections with singularities\non its codimension two skeleton, ${\\cal A}_{C-flat} \\subset \\bar{\\cal A}_M$. If\ncellular decomposition $C_2$ is finer than cellular decomposition $C_1$, there\nis a coarse graining map $\\pi_{C_2 \\to C_1}: {\\cal A}_{C_2-flat} \\to {\\cal\nA}_{C_1-flat}$. We prove that the triple $({\\cal A}_{C_2-flat}, \\pi_{C_2 \\to\nC_1}, {\\cal A}_{C_1-flat})$ is a principal fiber bundle with a preferred global\nsection given by the natural inclusion map $i_{C_1 \\to C_2}: {\\cal\nA}_{C_1-flat} \\to {\\cal A}_{C_2-flat}$.\n  Since the spaces ${\\cal A}_{C-flat}$ are partially ordered (by inclusion) and\nthis order is directed in the direction of refinement, we can define a\ncontinuum limit, $C \\to M$. We prove that, in an appropriate sense, $\\lim_{C\n\\to M} {\\cal A}_{C-flat} = \\bar{\\cal A}_M$. We also define a construction of\nmeasures in $\\bar{\\cal A}_M$ as the continuum limit (not a projective limit) of\neffective measures.\n", "  This text, written as dissertation within the M.Sc. course in particle theory\nat the Centre for Particle Theory, University of Durham, during the academic\nyear 1993/94, reviews two articles by D.Gross and by D.Gross and W.Taylor which\ninterpret the 1/N- expansion of the partition function of $QCD_2$ as string\nperturbation series. For this required mathematical and physical background is\npresented.\n", "  We show that a closed Nielsen-Olesen string in presence of a point scalar\nsource exhibits the phenomenon of Fermi-Bose transmutation. This provides\nphysical support to previous claims about transmutation between bosonic and\nfermionic one-dimensional structures in (3+1) dimensions. In order to render\nthe computations mathematically rigorous we have resorted to an Euclidean\nlattice regularization.\n", "  We find exact solutions of the string equations of motion and constraints\ndescribing the {\\em classical}\\ splitting of a string into two. We show that\nfor the same Cauchy data, the strings that split have {\\bf smaller} action than\nthe string without splitting. This phenomenon is already present in flat\nspace-time. The mass, energy and momentum carried out by the strings are\ncomputed. We show that the splitting solution describes a natural decay process\nof one string of mass $M$ into two strings with a smaller total mass and some\nkinetic energy. The standard non-splitting solution is contained as a\nparticular case. We also describe the splitting of a closed string in the\nbackground of a singular gravitational plane wave, and show how the presence of\nthe strong gravitational field increases (and amplifies by an overall factor)\nthe negative difference between the action of the splitting and non-splitting\nsolutions.\n", "  The nonlocal regularization method, recently proposed in\nref.\\,\\ct{emkw91,kw92,kw93}, is extended to general gauge theories by\nreformulating it along the ideas of the antibracket-antifield formalism. From\nthe interplay of both frameworks a fully regularized version of the\nfield-antifield (FA) formalism arises, being able to deal with higher order\nloop corrections and to describe higher order loop contributions to the BRST\nanomaly. The quantum master equation, considered in the FA framework as the\nquantity parametrizing BRST anomalies, is argued to be incomplete at two and\nhigher order loops and conjectured to reproduce only the one-loop corrections\nto the $\\hbar^p$ anomaly generated by the addition of $O(\\hbar^{k})$, $k<p$,\ncounterterms. Chiral $W_3$ gravity is used to exemplify the nonlocally\nregularized FA formalism. First, the regularized one-loop quantum master\nequation is used to compute the complete one-loop anomaly. Its two-loop order,\nhowever, is shown to reproduce only the modification to the two-loop anomaly\nproduced by the addition of a suitable one-loop counterterm, thereby providing\nan explicit verification of the previous statement for $p=2$. The well-known\nuniversal two-loop anomaly, instead, is alternatively obtained from the BRST\nvariation of the nonlocally regulated effective action. Incompleteness of the\nquantum master equation is thus concluded to be a consequence of a naive\nderivation of the FA BRST Ward identity.\n", "  In the present article we analyze the problem of a relativistic Dirac\nelectron in the presence of a combination of a Coulomb field, a $1/r$ scalar\npotential as well as a Dirac magnetic monopole and an Aharonov-Bohm potential.\nUsing the algebraic method of separation of variables, the Dirac equation\nexpressed in the local rotating diagonal gauge is completely separated in\nspherical coordinates, and exact solutions are obtained. We compute the energy\nspectrum and analyze how it depends on the intensity of the Aharonov-Bohm and\nthe magnetic monopole strengths.\n", "  We use a recently developed action principle in spaces with curvature and\ntorsion to derive the Euler equations of motion for a rigid body within the\nbody-fixed coordinate system. This serves as an example that the particle\ntrajectories in a space with curvature and torsion follow the straightest paths\n(autoparallels), not the shortest paths (geodesics), as commonly believed.\n", "  Recent results on classical and quantum strings in a variety of black hole\nand cosmological spacetimes, in various dimensions, are presented. The curved\nbackgrounds under consideration include the $2+1$ black hole anti de Sitter\nspacetime and its dual, the black string, the ordinary $D\\geq 4$ black holes\nwith or without a cosmological constant, the de Sitter and anti de Sitter\nspacetimes and static Robertson-Walker spacetimes. Exact solutions to the\nstring equations of motion and constraints are obtained in these backgrounds\nand their physical properties (length, energy, pressure) are described. The\nexistence of {\\it multi-string} solutions, describing finitely or infinitely\nmany strings, is shown to be a general feature of spacetimes with a positive or\nnegative cosmological constant. Furthermore, using a canonical quantization\nprocedure, we find the string mass spectrum in de Sitter and anti de Sitter\nspacetimes. New features as compared to the string spectrum in flat Minkowski\nspacetime appear, for instance the {\\it fine-structure effect} at all levels\nbeyond the graviton in both de Sitter and anti de Sitter spacetimes, and the\n{\\it non-existence} of a Hagedorn temperature in anti de Sitter spacetime.\nFinally, we consider the effect of spatial curvature on the string dynamics in\nRobertson-Walker spacetimes.\n", "  The exact general solution of circular strings in $2+1$ dimensional de Sitter\nspacetime is described completely in terms of elliptic functions. The novel\nfeature here is that one single world-sheet generically describes {\\it\ninfinitely many} (different and independent) strings. This has no analogue in\nflat spacetime. The circular strings are either oscillating (\"stable\") or\nindefinitely expanding (\"unstable\"). We then compute the {\\it exact} equation\nof state of circular strings in the $2+1$ dimensional de Sitter (dS) and anti\nde Sitter (AdS) spacetimes, and analyze its properties for the different\n(oscillating, contracting and expanding) strings. We finally perform a\nsemi-classical quantization of the oscillating circular strings. We find the\nmass formula $\\alpha'm^2_{\\mbox{dS}}\\approx 4n-5H^2\\alpha'n^2,\\;(n\\in N_0),$\nand a {\\it finite} number of states $N_{\\mbox{dS}}\\approx 0.34/(H^2\\alpha')$ in\nde Sitter spacetime; $m^2_{\\mbox{AdS}}\\approx H^2n^2$ (large $n\\in N$) and\n$N_{\\mbox{AdS}}=\\infty$ in anti de Sitter spacetime. The level spacing grows\nwith $n$ in AdS spacetime, while is approximately constant (although smaller\nthan in Minkowski spacetime and slightly decreasing) in dS spacetime.\n", "  We investigate the question of how the knowledge of sufficiently many local\nconservation laws for a model can be utilized to solve the model. We show that\nfor models where the conservation laws can be written in one-sided forms, like\n$\\barpartial Q_s = 0$, the problem can always be reduced to solving a closed\nsystem of ordinary differential equations. We investigate the $A_1$, $A_2$, and\n$B_2$ Toda field theories in considerable detail from this viewpoint. One of\nour findings is that there is in each case a transformation group intrinsic to\nthe model. This group is built on a specific real form of the Lie algebra used\nto label the Toda field theory. It is the group of field transformations which\nleaves the conserved densities invariant.\n", "  We present a direct approach for the calculation of functional determinants\nof the Laplace operator on balls. Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions are\nconsidered. Using this approach, formulas for any value of the dimension, $D$,\nof the ball, can be obtained quite easily. Explicit results are presented here\nfor dimensions $D=2,3,4,5$ and $6$.\n", "  In the present article we solve the Dirac equation in a de Sitter universe\nwhen a constant electric field is present. Using the Bogoliubov\ntransformations, we compute the rate of spin 1/2 created particles by the\nelectric field. We compare our results with the scalar case. We also analyze\nthe behavior of the density of particles created in the limit H=0, when de\nSitter background reduces to a flat space-time.\n", "  We address non-perturbative effects and duality symmetries in $N=2$ heterotic\nstring theories in four dimensions. Specifically, we consider how each of the\nfour lines of enhanced gauge symmetries in the perturbative moduli space of\n$N=2$ $T_2$ compactifications is split into 2 lines where monopoles and dyons\nbecome massless. This amounts to considering non-perturbative effects\noriginating from enhanced gauge symmetries at the microscopic string level. We\nshow that the perturbative and non-perturbative monodromies consistently lead\nto the results of Seiberg-Witten upon identication of a consistent truncation\nprocedure from local to rigid $N=2$ supersymmetry.\n", "  We present a real space renormalization-group map for probabilities of random\nwalks on a hierarchical lattice. From this, we study the asymptotic behavior of\nthe end-to-end distance of a weakly self- avoiding random walk (SARW) that\npenalizes the (self-)intersection of two random walks in dimension four on the\nhierarchical lattice.\n", "  An Introduction to Hopf algebras as a tool for the regularization of relavent\nquantities in quantum field theory is given. We deform algebraic spaces by\nintroducing q as a regulator of a non-commutative and non-cocommutative Hopf\nalgebra. Relevant quantities are finite provided q\\neq 1 and diverge in the\nlimit q\\rightarrow 1. We discuss q-regularization on different q-deformed\nspaces for \\lambda\\phi^4 theory as example to illustrate the idea.\n", "  Some inadequacy in the traditional description of the phenomenon of\nelectro-magnetic field radiation created by a point charge moving along a\nstraight line with an acceleration is found and discussed in this paper in\ndetail. The possibility of simultaneous coexistence of Newton instantaneous\nlong-range interaction and Faraday-Maxwell short-rang interaction is pointed\nout.\n", "  We study gravitational quantum mechanics violating (QMV) effects to masses of\nNambu-Goldstone bosons, taking majoron as an example. We show a supersymmetric\nmajoron has either mass of O(keV) for the dimension five potential or smaller\nmass for effective potentials with higher dimensions. We extend the Dashen's\nformula for pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons to include possible effects of QMV.\n", "  We propose a possible internal structure for a Schwarzschild black hole\nresulting from the creation of multiple de Sitter universes with lightlike\nboundaries when the curvature reaches Planckian values. The intersection of the\nboundaries is studied and a scenario leading to disconnected de Sitter\nuniverses is proposed. The application to the information loss problem is then\ndiscussed.\n", "  The quantum energy-momentum tensor ${\\hat T}^{\\mu\\nu}(x)$ is computed for\nstrings in Minkowski space-time. We compute its expectation value for different\nphysical string states both for open and closed bosonic strings. The states\nconsidered are described by normalizable wave-packets in the center of mass\ncoordinates. We find in particular that ${\\hat T}^{\\mu\\nu}(x)$ is {\\bf finite}\nwhich could imply that the classical divergence that occurs in string theory as\nwe approach the string position is removed at the quantum level as the string\nposition is smeared out by quantum fluctuations. For massive string states the\nexpectation value of ${\\hat T}^{\\mu\\nu}(x)$ vanishes at leading order (genus\nzero). For massless string states it has a non-vanishing value which we\nexplicitly compute and analyze for both spherically and cylindrically symmetric\nwave packets. The energy-momentum tensor components propagate outwards as a\nmassless lump peaked at $ r = t $.\n", "  In this talk we summarise our recent results on perturbative and\nnon-perturbative monodromies in four-dimensional heterotic strings with $N=2$\nspace-time supersymmetry, and we compare our results with the rigid $SU(2)$\n$N=2$ Yang-Mills monodromies.\n", "  We present here our considerations concerning the problem of classical\nconsistency of pseudoclassical models touched upon in a recent comment on our\npaper \"New pseudoclassical model for Weyl particle\".\n", "  In this paper we investigate how various equivalences between effective field\ntheories of $N=2$ SUSY Yang-Mills theory with matter can be understood through\nHiggs breaking, i.e. by giving expectation values to squarks. We give explicit\nexpressions for the flat directions for a wide class of examples.\n", "  In this note, we comment on Calabi-Yau spaces with Hodge numbers $h_{1,1}=3$\nand $h_{2,1}=243$. We focus on the Calabi-Yau space $WP_{1,1,2,8,12}(24)$ and\nshow how some of its instanton numbers are related to coefficients of certain\nmodular forms. We also comment on the relation of four dimensional exchange\nsymmetries in certain $N=2$ dual models to six dimensional heterotic/heterotic\nstring duality.\n", "  By introducing a nonlinearly transforming goldstino field\nnon-super\\-sym\\-metric matter can be coupled to supergravity. This implies the\npossibility of coupling a standard model with one Higgs to supergravity.\n", "  We present a rigurous disscusion for abelian $BF$ theories in which the base\nmanifold of the $U(1)$ bundle is homeomorphic to a Hilbert space. The theory\nhas an infinte number of stages of reducibility. We specify conditions on the\nbase manifold under which the covarinat quantization of the system can be\nperformed unambiguously. Applications of the formulation to the superparticle\nand the supertstring are also discussed.\n", "  We consider an 8--dimensional gravitational theory, which possesses a\nprinciple fiber bundle structure, with Lorentz--scalar fields coupled to the\nmetric. One of them plays the role of a Higgs field and the other one that of a\ndilaton field. The effective cosmological constant is interpreted as a Higgs\npotential. The Yukawa couplings are introduce by hand. The extra dimensions\nconstitute a $SU(2)_{L} \\times U(1)_{Y} \\times SU(2)_{R}$ group manifold. Dirac\nfields are coupled to the potentials derived from the metric. As result, we\nobtain an effective four--dimensional theory which contains all couplings of a\nWeinberg--Salam--Glashow theory in a curved space-time. The masses of the gauge\nbosons and of the first two fermion families are given by the theory.\n", "  In this paper, two things are done. (i) First, it is shown that any global\nsymmetry of a gauge-invariant theory can be extended to the ghosts and the\nantifields so as to leave invariant the solution of the master-equation (before\ngauge fixing). (ii) Second, it is proved that the incorporation of the rigid\nsymmetries to the solution of the master-equation through the introduction of a\nconstant ghost for each global symmetry can be obstructed already at the\nclassical level whenever the theory possesses higher order conservation laws.\nExplicit examples are given.\n", "  The production rate of a soft photon from a hot quark-gluon plasma is\ncomputed to leading order at logarithmic accuracy. The canonical\nhard-thermal-loop resummation scheme leads to logarithmically divergent\nproduction rate due to mass singularities. We show that these mass\nsingularities are screened by employing the effective hard-quark propagator,\nwhich is obtained through resummation of one-loop self-energy part in a\nself-consistent manner. The damping-rate part of the effective hard-quark\npropagator, rather than the thermal-mass part, plays the dominant role of\nscreening mass singularities. Diagrams including photon--(hard-)quark vertex\ncorrections also yield leading contribution to the production rate.\n", "  An algebraic program of computation and characterization of higher loop BRST\nanomalies is presented. We propose a procedure for disentangling a genuine{\\it\nlocal} higher loop anomaly from the quantum dressings of lower loop anomalies.\nFor such higher loop anomalies we derive a local consistency condition, which\nis the generalisation of the Wess-Zumino condition for the one-loop anomaly.\nThe development is presented in the framework of the field-antifield formalism,\nmaking use of a nonlocal regularization method. The theoretical construction is\nexemplified by explicitly computing the two-loop anomaly of chiral $W_3$\ngravity. We also give, for the first time, an explicit check of the local\ntwo--loop consistency condition that is associated with this anomaly.\n", "  We study functional determinants for Dirac operators on manifolds with\nboundary. We give, for local boundary conditions, an explicit formula relating\nthese determinants to the corresponding Green functions. We finally apply this\nresult to the case of a bidimensional disk under bag-like conditions.\n", "  We compute the functional determinant for a Dirac operator in the presence of\nan Abelian gauge field on a bidimensional disk, under global boundary\nconditions of the type introduced by Atiyah-Patodi-Singer. We also discuss the\nconnection between our result and the index theorem.\n", "  We determine self-consistently the hard-quark and hard-gluon modes in hot\nQCD. The damping-rate part in resummed hard-quark or hard-gluon propagators,\nrather than the thermal-mass part, plays the dominant role.\n", "  A generalization of the classical one-dimensional Darboux transformation to\narbitrary n-dimensional oriented Riemannian manifolds is constructed using an\nintrinsic formulation based on the properties of twisted Hodge Laplacians. The\nclassical two-dimensional Moutard transformation is also generalized to\nnon-compact oriented Riemannian manifolds of dimension n greater than one. New\nexamples of quasi-exactly solvable multidimensional matrix Schr\\\"odinger\noperators on curved manifolds are obtained by applying the above results.\n", "  The theory of free relativistic fields is shown to arise in a unified manner\nfrom higher-order, configuration-space, irreducible representations of the\nPoincar\\'e group. A de Sitter subalgebra, in the massive case, and a Poincar\\'e\nsubalgebra, in the massless case, of the enveloping algebra of the Poincar\\'e\ngroup are the suitable higher-order polarizations. In particular, a simple\ngroup-theoretic derivation of the Dirac equation is given.\n", "  We show how to extend the standard functional approach to bosonisation, based\non a decoupling change of path-integral variables, to the case in which a\nfinite temperature is considered. As examples, in order to both illustrate and\ncheck the procedure, we derive the thermodynamical partition functions for the\nThirring and Schwinger models.\n", "  Some exact solutions to the classical matrix model equations that arise in\nthe context of M(embrane) theory are given, and their topological nature is\nidentified.\n", "  We investigate consistency conditions for supersymmetric gauge theories in\nhigher dimensions. First, we give a survey of Seiberg's necessary conditions\nfor the existence of such theories with simple groups in five and six\ndimensions. We then make some comments on how theories in different dimensions\nare related. In particular, we discuss how the Landau pole can be avoided in\ntheories that are not asymptotically free in four dimensions, and the mixing of\ntensor and vector multiplets in dimensional reduction from six dimensions.\n", "  We use a phase space description to (re)derive a first order form of the\nBorn-Infeld action for D-branes. This derivation also makes it possible to\nconsider the limit where the tension of the D-brane goes to zero. We find that\nin this limit, which can be considered to be the strong coupling limit of the\nfundamental string theory, the world-volume of the D-brane generically splits\ninto a collection of tensile strings.\n", "  A recursive formula for an infinity of integrals of motion for the\nsuper-Liouville theory is derived. The integrable boundary interactions for\nthis theory and the super-Toda theory based on the affine superalgebra $B^{(1)}\n(0,1)$ are computed. In the first case the boundary interactions are\nunambiguously determined by supersymmetry, whilst in the latter case there are\nfree parameters.\n", "  The antifield formalism is extended so as to incorporate the rigid symmetries\nof a given theory. To that end, it is necessary to introduce global ghosts not\nonly for the given rigid symmetries, but also for all the higher order\nconservation laws, associated with conserved antisymmetric tensors. Otherwise,\none may encounter obstructions of the type discussed in [13]. These higher\norder conservation laws are shown to define additional rigid symmetries of the\nmaster equation and to form -- together with the standard symmetries -- an\ninteresting algebraic structure. They lead furthermore to independent Ward\nidentities which are derived in the standard manner, because the resulting\nmaster (\"Zinn-Justin\") equation capturing both the gauge symmetries and the\nrigid symmetries of all orders takes a known form. Issues such as anomalies or\nconsistent deformations of the action preserving some set of rigid symmetries\ncan be also systematically analysed in this framework.\n", "  This is the written version of a series of lectures reviewing the basics of\nduality as applied to p-forms and sigma-models. The ideas are introduced by way\nof worked examples, often quite detailed. Our approach is very pedestrian and\nthe presentation is aimed at non-specialists, such as e.g. graduate students.\n", "  The computation of the microcanonical density of states for a string gas in a\nfinite volume needs a one by one count because of the discrete nature of the\nspectrum. We present a way to do it using geometrical arguments in phase space.\nWe take advantage of this result in order to obtain the thermodynamical\nmagnitudes of the system. We show that the results for an open universe exactly\ncoincide with the infinite volume limit of the expression obtained for the gas\nin a box. For any finite volume the Hagedorn temperature is a maximum one, and\nthe specific heat is always positive. We also present a definition of pressure\ncompatible with R-duality seen as an exact symmetry, which allows us to make a\nstudy on the physical phase space of the system. Besides a maximum temperature\nthe gas presents an asymptotic pressure.\n", "  We examine the dependence on all gauge parameters in the example of the\nAbelian Higgs model by applying a general algebraic method which roots in an\nextension of the usual Slavnov-Taylor identity. This method automatically\nyields all information about the gauge parameter dependence of Green functions\nand therefore especially allows to control the range of ``good'' normalization\nconditions. In this context we show that the physical on-shell normalization\nconditions are in complete agreement with the restrictions dictated by the\nenlarged Slavnov-Taylor identity and that the coupling can be fixed in an\neasily handleable way on the Ward identity of local gauge invariance. As an\napplication of the general method we also study the Callan-Symanzik equation\nand the renormalization group equation of the Abelian Higgs model.\n", "  Through introducing a notion of renormalization of particle-number density, a\nsimple perturbation scheme of nonequilibrium quantum-field theory is proposed.\nIn terms of the renormalized particle-distribution functions, which\ncharacterize the system, the structure of the scheme (and then also the\nstructure of amplitudes and reaction rates) are the same as in the equilibrium\nthermal field theory. Then, as an obvious consequence, the amplitudes and\nreaction rates computed in this scheme are free from pinch singularities due to\nmultiple products of $\\delta$-functions, which inevitably present in\ntraditional perturbation scheme.\n", "  The classical electromagnetic field of a spinless point electron is described\nin a formalism with extended causality by discrete finite point-vector fields\nwith discrete and localized point interactions. These fields are taken as a\nclassical representation of photons, \"classical photons\". They are all\ntransversal photons; there are no scalar nor longitudinal photons and the\nLorentz gauge condition is automatically satisfied. The angular distribution of\nemitted photons reproduces the directions of maximum emission of the standard\nformalism. The Maxwell formalism in terms of continuous and distributed fields\nis retrieved by the smearing of these discrete fields over the light-cone, and\nin this process scalar and longitudinal photons are necessarily created and\nadded. Divergences and singularities are by-products of this averaging process.\nThe discrete and the continuous formalisms are not equivalent. The discrete one\nis superior for not having divergencies, singularities, unphysical degrees of\nfreedom, for describing processes of creation and annihilation of particles\ninstead of advanced solutions, for having a natural explanation for the photon,\nand for generating the continuous formalism as an effective one. It enlightens\nthe meaning and the origin of the non-physical photons in the standard\nformalism. The standard theory based on average continuous fields is more\nconvenient and appropriate for dealing with a large number of charges and for\nrelatively large distances, but for few charges or for the field configuration\nin a charge close neighborhood the discrete field description is mandatorily\nrequired for avoiding inconsistencies.\n", "  We make a first step to extend to the supersymmetric arena the effective\naction method, which is used to covariantly deduce the low energy dynamics of\ntopological defects directly from their parent field theory. By focussing on\ntwo-dimensional supersymmetric theories we are able to derive the appropriate\nchange of variables that singles out the low energy degrees of freedom. These\ncorrespond to super-worldline embeddings in superspace which are subject to a\ngeometrical constraint. We obtain a supersymmetric and $\\kappa$--invariant low\nenergy expansion, with the standard superparticle action as the leading term,\nwhich can be used for the determination of higher-order corrections. Our\nformulation fits quite naturally with the present geometrical description of\n$\\kappa$--symmetry in terms of the so-called geometrodynamical constraints. It\nalso provides a basis for the exploration of these issues in higher-dimensional\nsupersymmetric theories.\n", "  We present the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz as a way to factorize the partition\nfunction of a 2d field theory, in particular, a conformal field theory and we\ncompare it with another approach to factorization due to K. Schoutens which\nconsists of diagonalizing matrix recursion relations between the partition\nfunctions at consecutive levels. We prove that both are equivalent, taking as\nexamples the SU(2) spinons and the 3-state Potts model. In the latter case we\nsee that there are two different thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equation systems\nwith the same physical content, of which the second is new and corresponds to a\none-quasiparticle representation, as opposed to the usual two-quasiparticle\nrepresentation. This new thermodynamic Bethe ansatz system leads to a new\ndilogarithmic formula for the central charge of that model.\n", "  It has been known for some time that the SL(2,R) WZWN model reduces to\nLiouville theory. Here we give a direct and physical derivation of this result\nbased on the classical string equations of motion and the proper string size.\nThis allows us to extract precisely the physical effects of the metric and\nantisymmetric tensor, respectively, on the {\\it exact} string dynamics in the\nSL(2,R) background. The general solution to the proper string size is also\nfound. We show that the antisymmetric tensor (corresponding to conformal\ninvariance) generally gives rise to repulsion, and it precisely cancels the\ndominant attractive term arising from the metric.\n  Both the sinh-Gordon and the cosh-Gordon sectors of the string dynamics in\nnon-conformally invariant AdS spacetime reduce here to the Liouville equation\n(with different signs of the potential), while the original Liouville sector\nreduces to the free wave equation. Only the very large classical string size is\naffected by the torsion. Medium and small size string behaviours are unchanged.\n  We also find illustrative classes of string solutions in the SL(2,R)\nbackground: dynamical closed as well as stationary open spiralling strings, for\nwhich the effect of torsion is somewhat like the effect of rotation in the\nmetric. Similarly, the string solutions in the 2+1 BH-AdS background with\ntorsion and angular momentum are fully analyzed.\n", "  Negative dimensional integration method (NDIM) seems to be a very promising\ntechnique for evaluating massless and/or massive Feynman diagrams. It is unique\nin the sense that the method gives solutions in different regions of external\nmomenta simultaneously. Moreover, it is a technique whereby the difficulties\nassociated with performing parametric integrals in the standard approach are\ntransferred to a simpler solving of a system of linear algebraic equations,\nthanks to the polynomial character of the relevant integrands. We employ this\nmethod to evaluate a scalar integral for a massless two-loop three-point vertex\nwith all the external legs off-shell, and consider several special cases for\nit, yielding results, even for distinct simpler diagrams. We also consider the\npossibility of NDIM in non-covariant gauges such as the light-cone gauge and do\nsome illustrative calculations, showing that for one-degree violation of\ncovariance (i.e., one external, gauge-breaking, light-like vector $n_{\\mu}$)\nthe ensuing results are concordant with the ones obtained via either the usual\ndimensional regularization technique, or the use of principal value\nprescription for the gauge dependent pole, while for two-degree violation of\ncovariance --- i.e., two external, light-like vectors $n_{\\mu}$, the\ngauge-breaking one, and (its dual) $n^{\\ast}_{\\mu}$ --- the ensuing results are\nconcordant with the ones obtained via causal constraints or the use of the\nso-called generalized Mandelstam-Leibbrandt prescription.\n", "  The greybody factors in BTZ black holes are evaluated from 2D CFT in the\nspirit of AdS$_3$/CFT correspondence. The initial state of black holes in the\nusual calculation of greybody factors by effective CFT is described as\nPoincar\\'{e} vacuum state in 2D CFT. The normalization factor which cannot be\nfixed in the effective CFT without appealing to string theory is shown to be\ndetermined by the normalized bulk-to-boundary Green function. The relation\namong the greybody factors in different dimensional black holes is exhibited.\nTwo kinds of $(h,{\\bar h})=(1,1)$ operators which couple with the boundary\nvalue of massless scalar field are discussed.\n", "  T-duality realized on D-brane effective actions is studied from a pure\nworldvolume point of view. It is proved that invariance in the form of the\nDirac-Born-Infeld and Wess-Zumino terms fixes the T-duality transformations of\nthe NS-NS and R-R background fields, respectively. The analysis is extended to\nuncover the mapping of global symmetries of the corresponding pair of D-branes\ninvolved in the transformation.\n", "  A review is made on some recent studies which support the point of view that\nthe relativistic field theory quantized on the light-front (LF) is more\ntransparent compared to the conventional equal-time one. The discussion may be\nof relevance in the context of the quantization of gravitation theory. The LF\nquantization is argued to be equally appropriate as the conventional equal-time\none. The description on the LF of the spontaneous symmetry breaking and the\n(tree level) Higgs mechanism, the emergence of the $\\theta$-vacua in the\nSchwinger model, the absence of such vacua in the Chiral SM, the BRS-BFT\nquantization of the latter on the LF are among the topics discussed. Comments\non the irrelevance, in the quantized theory, of the fact that the hyperplanes\n$x^{\\pm}=0$ constitute characteristic surfaces of the hyperbolic partial\ndifferential equation are also made. The LF theory quantized on, say, the\n$x^{+}=const.$ hyperplanes seems to already contain in it the information on\nthe equal-$x^{-}$ commutators as well. A theoretical reaffirmation of that the\nexperimental data is to be confronted with the predictions of a classical\ntheory model only after it has been upgraded through its quantization seems to\nemerge.\n", "  We describe the local D=4 field theory on $\\kappa$--deformed Minkowski space\nas nonlocal relativistic field theory on standard Minkowski space--time. For\nsimplicity the case of $\\kappa$-deformed scalar field $\\phi$ with the\ninteraction $\\lambda \\phi^{4}$ is considered, and the $\\kappa$--deformed\ninteraction vertex is described. It appears that fundamental mass parameter\n$\\kappa$ plays a role of regularizing imaginary Pauli--Villars mass in\n$\\kappa$--deformed propagator.\n", "  A simple algebraic technique is developed to obtain deformed energy spectra\nfor the P\\\"oschl-Teller potentials.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the formulation of a non-pertubative theory of\nthe bosonic string. We introduce a formal group $G$ which we propose as the\n``universal moduli space'' for such a formulation. This is motivated because\n$G$ establishes a natural link between representations of the Virasoro algebra\nand the moduli space of curves. Among other properties of $G$ it is shown that\na ``local'' version of the Mumford formula holds on $G$.\n", "  New relations involving curvature components for the various connections\nappearing in the theory of almost product manifolds are given and the conformal\nbehaviour of these connections are studied. New identities for the irreducible\nparts of the deformation tensor are derived. Some direct physical applications\nin Kaluza-Klein and gauge theory are discussed.\n", "  This paper describes perturbative framework, on the basis of the\nclosed-time-path formalism, in terms of quasiparticle picture for studying\nquasiuniform relativistic quantum field systems near equilibrium and\nnonequilibrium quasistationary systems. Two calculational schemes are\nintroduced, the one is formulated on the basis of the initial-particle\ndistribution function and the one is formulated on the basis of the\n``physical''-particle distribution function. It is shown that both schemes are\nequivalent and lead to a generalized kinetic or Boltzmann equation. Concrete\nprocedure of computing a generic amplitude is presented.\n", "  The general criteria for finding bosonic supersymmetric worldvolume solitons\nis reviewed. We concentrate on D-branes, discussing in particular, bion/dyon\nsolutions and D3 branes on NS5 backgrounds.\n", "  The periodic bounce configurations responsible for quantum tunneling are\nobtained explicitly and are extended to the finite energy case for\nminisuperspace models of the Universe. As a common feature of the tunneling\nmodels at finite energy considered here we observe that the period of the\nbounce increases with energy monotonically. The periodic bounces do not have\nbifurcations and make no contribution to the nucleation rate except the one\nwith zero energy. The sharp first order phase transition from quantum tunneling\nto thermal activation is verified with the general criterions.\n", "  We suggest a closed form expression for the path integral of quantum\ntransition amplitudes. We introduce a quantum action with renormalized\nparameters. We present numerical results for the $V \\sim x^{4}$ potential. The\nrenormalized action is relevant for quantum chaos and quantum instantons.\n", "  Winding number transitions from quantum to classical behavior are studied in\nthe case of the {1+1} dimensional Mottola-Wipf model with the space coordinate\non a circle for exploring the possibility of obtaining transitions of second\norder. The model is also studied as a prototype theory which demonstrates the\nprocedure of such investigations. In the model at hand we find that even on a\ncircle the transitions remain those of first order.\n", "  Following our earlier investigations we examine the quantum-classical winding\nnumber transition in the Abelian-Higgs system. It is demonstrated that the\nsphaleron transition in this system is of the smooth second order type in the\nfull range of parameter space. Comparison of the action of classical vortices\nwith that of the sphaleron supports our finding.\n", "  Using a nonlinear electrodynamics coupled to General Relativity a new regular\nexact black hole solution is found. The nonlinear theory reduces to the Maxwell\none in the weak limit, and the solution corresponds to a charged black hole for\n|q| \\leq 2s_c m \\approx 1.05 m, with metric, curvature invariants, and electric\nfield regular everywhere.\n", "  Normalized eigenvalue counting measure of the sum of two Hermitian (or real\nsymmetric) matrices $A_{n}$ and $B_{n}$ rotated independently with respect to\neach other by the random unitary (or orthogonal) Haar distributed matrix\n$U_{n}$ (i.e. $A_{n}+U_{n}^{\\ast}B_{n}U_{n}$) is studied in the limit of large\nmatrix order $n$. Convergence in probability to a limiting nonrandom measure is\nestablished. A functional equation for the Stieltjes transform of the limiting\nmeasure in terms of limiting eigenvalue measures of $A_{n}$ and $B_{n}$ is\nobtained and studied.\n  Keywords: random matrices, eigenvalue distribution\n", "  A novel realization of the classical SU(2) algebra is introduced for the\nDirac relativistic hydrogen atom defining a set of operators that, besides,\nallow the factorization of the problem. An extra phase is needed as a new\nvariable in order to define the algebra. We take advantage of the operators to\nsolve the Dirac equation using algebraic methods. To acomplish this, a similar\npath to the one used in the angular momentum case is employed; hence, the\nradial eigenfuntions calculated comprise non unitary representations of the\nalgebra. One of the interesting properties of such non unitary representations\nis that they are not labeled by integer nor by half-integer numbers as happens\nin the usual angular momentum representation.\n", "  Exact, degenerate two-forms on time-extended space R X M which are invariant\nunder the unsteady, incompressible fluid motion on 3D region M are introduced.\nThe equivalence class up to exact one-forms of each potential one-form is\nsplitted by the velocity field. The components of this splitting corresponds to\nLagrangian and Eulerian conservation laws for helicity densities. These are\nexpressed as the closure of three-forms which depend on two discrete and a\ncontinuous parameter. Each two-form is extended to a symplectic form on R X M.\nThe subclasses of potential one-forms giving rise to Eulerian helicity\nconservations is shown to result in conformally symplectic structures on R X M.\nThe connection between Lagrangian and Eulerian conservation laws for helicity\nis shown to be the same as the conformal equivalence of a Poisson bracket\nalgebra to infinitely many local Lie algebra of functions on R X M.\n", "  As found by Bordemann and Hoppe and by Jevicki, a certain non-relativistic\nmodel of an irrotational and isentropic fluid, related to membranes and to\npartons, admits a Poincar\\'e symmetry. Bazeia and Jackiw associate this\ndynamical symmetry to a novel type of ``field dependent'' action on space-time.\nThe ``Kaluza-Klein type'' framework of Duval et al. is used to explain the\norigin of these symmetries and to derive the associated conserved quantities.\nIn the non-interacting case, the symmetry extends to the entire conformal\ngroup.\n", "  The symmetries and conserved quantities of Manton's modified\nsuperconductivity model with non-relativistic Maxwell-Chern-Simons dynamics\n(also related to the Quantized Hall Effect) are obtained in the ``Kaluza-Klein\ntype'' framework of Duval et al.\n", "  Following the techniques of M. Sato (see \\cite{Sa}), a generalization of the\nKP hierarchy for more than one variable is proposed. An approach to the\nclassification of solutions and a method to construct algebraic solutions is\nalso offered.\n", "  We address one of the open problems in quantization theory recently listed by\nRieffel. By developping in detail Connes' tangent groupoid principle and using\nprevious work by Landsman, we show how to construct a strict, flabby\nquantization, which is moreover an asymptotic morphism and satisfies the\nreality and traciality constraints, on any oriented Riemannian manifold. That\nconstruction generalizes the standard Moyal rule. The paper can be considered\nas an introduction to quantization theory from Connes' point of view.\n", "  The relation of s-convexity and sets modeling physical quasicrystals is\nexplained for quasicrystals related to quadratic unitary Pisot numbers. We show\nthat 1-dimensional model sets may be characterized by s-convexity for finite\nset of parameters s. It is shown that the three Pisot numbers\n$\\frac12(1+\\sqrt5)$, $1+\\sqrt2$, and $2+\\sqrt3$ related to experimentally\nobserved non-crystallographic symmetries are exceptional with respect to\ns-convexity.\n", "  It is shown that it is possible to write down tau functions for the\n$n$-component KP hierarchy in terms of non-abelian theta functions. This is a\ngeneralization of the rank 1 situation; that is, the relation of theta\nfunctions of Jacobians and tau functions for the KP hierarchy.\n", "  The general method of the cojmplex supersymmetrization\n(supercomplexifications) of the soliton equations with the odd (bi)\nhamiltoninan structure is established. New version of the supercomplexified\nKadomtsev-Petvishvili hierarchy is given. The second odd Hamiltonina operator\nof the SUSY KdV equation generates the odd N=2 SUSY Virasoro like algebra.\n", "  A method allowing to distinguish interacting from non-interacting systems\nbased on available time series is proposed and investigated. Some facts\nconcerning generalized Renyi dimensions that form the basis of our method are\nproved. We show that one can find the dimension of the part of the attractor of\nthe system connected with interaction between its parts. We use our method to\ndistinguish interacting from non-interacting systems on the examples of\nlogistic and H\\'enon maps. A classification of all possible interaction schemes\nis given.\n", "  We investigate the impact of the domain shape on wave propagation in\nexcitable media. Channelled domains with sinusoidal boundaries are considered.\nTrains of fronts generated periodically at an extreme of the channel are found\nto adopt a quasiperiodic spatial configuration stroboscopically frozen in time.\nThe phenomenon is studied in a model for the photo-sensitive\nBelousov-Zabotinsky reaction, but we give a theoretical derivation of the\nspatial return maps prescribing the height and position of the successive\nfronts that is valid for arbitrary excitable reaction-diffusion systems.\n", "  Through three examples we illustrate some of the concepts and ingredients\nrequired for pattern formation at mesoscopic scales. Two examples build on\nmicroscopic models where mesoscopic patterns emerge from homogeneous ground\nstates driven into instability by external forcing. In contrast, the third\nexample builds on a mesoscopic phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau type model of\nsolid-solid structural phase transitions. Here, mesoscopic textures emerge as a\nresult of competing length scales arising from the constraints of elastic\ncompatibility.\n", "  The muon magnetic anomaly may contain contributions from physics beyond the\nstandard model. At the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) a precision\nexperiment aims for a measurement of the muon magnetic anomaly $a_{\\mu}$ to\n0.35 ppm, where conclusions about various theoretical approaches beyond\nstandard theory can be expected. The difference between the spin precession and\ncyclotron frequencies is measured in a magnetic storage ring with highly\nhomogeneous field. Data taking is in progress and part of all recorded data has\nbeen analyzed. Combining all experimental results to date yields preliminarily\n$a_{\\mu}(expt)=1~165~921(5) \\cdot 10^{-9}$ (4 ppm) in agreement with standard\ntheory.\n", "  Hard-photon (E$_{\\gamma} >$ 30 MeV) emission issuing from proton-neutron\nbremsstrahlung collisions is investigated in four different heavy-ion reactions\nat intermediate bombarding energies ($^{36}$Ar+$^{197}$Au, $^{107}$Ag,\n$^{58}$Ni, $^{12}$C at 60{\\it A} MeV) coupling the TAPS photon spectrometer\nwith two charged-particle multidetectors covering more than 80% of the solid\nangle. The hard-photon spectra of the three heavier targets result from the\ncombination of two distinct exponential distributions with different slope\nparameters, a result which deviates from the behaviour expected for hard-photon\nproduction just in first-chance proton-neutron collisions. The thermal origin\nof the steeper bremsstrahlung component is confirmed by the characteristics of\nits slope and angular distribution. Such thermal hard-photons convey\nundisturbed information of the thermodynamical state of hot and excited nuclear\nsystems undergoing multifragmentation.\n", "  Inclusive and exclusive hard-photon (E$_\\gamma >$ 30 MeV) production in five\ndifferent heavy-ion reactions ($^{36}$Ar+$^{197}$Au, $^{107}$Ag, $^{58}$Ni,\n$^{12}$C at 60{\\it A} MeV and $^{129}$Xe+$^{120}$Sn at 50{\\it A} MeV) has been\nstudied coupling the TAPS photon spectrometer with several charged-particle\nmultidetectors covering more than 80% of 4$\\pi$. The measured spectra, slope\nparameters and source velocities as well as their target-dependence, confirm\nthe existence of thermal bremsstrahlung emission from secondary nucleon-nucleon\ncollisions that accounts for roughly 20% of the total hard-photon yield. The\nthermal slopes are a direct measure of the temperature of the excited nuclear\nsystems produced during the reaction.\n", "  The production of nuclear bremsstrahlung photons (E$_{\\gamma}>$ 30 MeV) has\nbeen studied in inclusive and exclusive measurements in four heavy-ion\nreactions at 60{\\it A} MeV. The measured photon spectra, angular distributions\nand multiplicities indicate that a significant part of the hard-photons are\nemitted in secondary nucleon-nucleon collisions from a thermally equilibrated\nsystem. The observation of the thermal component in multi-fragment\n$^{36}$Ar+$^{197}$Au reactions suggests that the breakup of the thermalized\nsource produced in this system occurs on a rather long time-scale.\n", "  Directed flow of deuterons, tritons, $^3$He, and $^4$He is studied in Au+Au\ncollisions at a beam momentum of about 10.8 $A$ GeV/c. Flow of all particles is\nanalyzed as a function of transverse momentum for different centralities of the\ncollision. The directed flow signal, $v_1(p_t)$, is found to increase with\nparticle mass. This mass dependence is strongest in the projectile rapidity\nregion.\n", "  A review of the characteristic features found in fully energy-damped,\nbinarydecay yields from light heavy-ion reactions with $20\\leq A_{target} +\nA_{projectile}\\leq 80$ is presented. The different aspects of these yields that\nhave been used to support models of compound-nucleus (CN) fission and\ndeep-inelastic dinucleus orbiting are highlighted. Cross section calculations\nbased on the statistical phase space at different stages of the reaction are\npresented and compared to the experimental results. Although the statistical\nmodels are found to reproduce most of the observed experimental behaviors, an\nadditional reaction component corresponding to a heavy-ion resonance or\norbiting mechanism is also evident in certain systems. The system dependence of\nthis second component is discussed. The extent to which the binary yields in\nvery light systems $(A_{CN} \\leq 32)$ can be viewed as resulting from a\nfusion-fission mechanism is explored. A number of unresolved questions, such as\nwhether the different observed behaviors reflect characteristically different\nreaction times, are discussed.\n", "  We estimate the ratio $R=g_{3}/g_{2}$ of the critical coupling constants\n$g_{2}$ and $g_{3}$ which are required to achieve binding of 2 or 3 bosons,\nrespectively, with a short-range interaction, and examine how this ratio\ndepends on the shape of the potential. Simple monotonous potentials give\n$R\\simeq 0.8$. A wide repulsive core pushes this ratio close to R=1. On the\nother hand, for an attractive well protected by an external repulsive barrier,\nthe ratio approaches the rigorous lower bound $R=2/3$. We also present results\nfor N=4 bosons, sketch the extension to $N>4$, and discuss various\nconsequences.\n", "  The $\\pi$, $\\eta$ and $\\rho$ exchange contributions to the cross-section for\nthe reaction $pp\\to pp\\eta$ near threshold are calculated with a\nphenomenological description of the intermediate S11 (N(1535)) resonance for\nall exchange mechanisms. The final state interaction in the $pp$ system is\ndescribed by realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction models. The sensitivity of\nthe results to the phenomenological models for the $\\eta$-nucleon transition\namplitude and the nucleon-nucleon interaction is explored. The $\\eta$ exchange\nmechanism is found to play a dominant role. The off-shell behavior of the $\\eta\nN \\to \\eta N$ amplitude within the $\\eta-$exchange amplitude leads to a result\nsignificantly different from that obtained with the constant scattering length\napproximation. The two-nucleon amplitudes that are associated with the short\nrange components of the nucleon-nucleon interaction contribute significantly to\nthe cross section.\n", "  The Dirac structure of the nucleon self-energy in symmetric nuclear matter as\nwell as neutron matter is derived from a realistic meson exchange model for the\nnucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction. It is demonstrated that the effects of\ncorrelations on the effective NN interaction in the nuclear medium can be\nparameterized by means of an effective meson exchange. This analysis leads to a\nvery intuitive interpretation of correlation effects and also provides an\nefficient parametrization of an effective interaction to be used in\nrelativistic structure calculations for finite nuclei.\n", "  The three nucleon interaction that arises from pion and the effective scalar\nand vector meson exchange components of the nucleon-nucleon interaction is\nconstructed and shown to be repulsive. Using several wavefunction models we\nshow that this interaction reduces the calculated binding energy of the\ntrinucleons by about 200 keV. The contributions of intermediate $N$(1440)\nresonances to this three nucleon interaction and of the $D$-state component in\nthe trinucleon model are estimated, and shown to be small.\n", "  We evaluate the contribution to the nucleon-nucleon interaction due to\ncorrelated $\\pi\\rho$ exchange in the $\\pi$, $\\omega$, and $A_1$/$H_1$ channels\nby means of dispersion-theoretic methods based on a realistic meson exchange\nmodel for the interaction between $\\pi$ and $\\rho$ mesons. These processes have\nsubstantial effects: In the pionic channel it counterbalances the suppression\ngenerated by a soft $\\pi NN$ form factor of monopole type with a cutoff mass of\nabout 1 GeV; in the $\\omega$-channel it provides nearly half of the empirical\nrepulsion, leaving little room for explicit quark-gluon effects.\n", "  We investigate the domain of coupling constants which achieve binding for a\n3-body system, while none of the 2-body subsystems is bound. We derive some\ngeneral properties of the shape of the domain, and rigorous upper bounds on its\nsize, using a Hall--Post decomposition of the Hamiltonian. Numerical\nillustrations are provided in the case of a Yukawa potential, using a simple\nvariational method.\n", "  We have evaluated nucleon and pion electromagnetic form factors using for the\nfirst time eigenfunctions of a light-front mass operator, reproducing a large\nset of energy levels, and constituent quark form factors in the one-body\ncurrent. The comparison with the experimental data yields valuable information\non the electromagnetic structure of light constituent quarks and on the\ndifferent role played by their Dirac and Pauli form factors.\n", "  The nuclear structure function F_2A(x) has been studied in the Bjorken limit\nfor (l, l') scattering on nuclei in the region of x > 1 and was found to be\nvery sensitive to the information contained in the nucleon spectral function in\nnuclei, particularly the correlations between momenta and energies in the\nregion of large momenta. Calculations were done in a local density\napproximation using two different spectral functions for nuclear matter.\nResults are compared to those obtained for a spectral function which has been\nevaluated directly for the finite nucleus, ^{16}O, under consideration. For\nvalues of x around 1.5 and larger the quasiparticle contribution is negligible,\nthus stressing the sensitivity of the present reaction to the dynamical\nproperties of nuclei beyond the shell model approach. Several approximations\nwhich are usually employed in studies of the EMC effect have been analyzed and\ntheir inaccuracy in this region is demonstrated. The results stress the fact\nthat the nuclear structure function contains important information on nuclear\ndynamical correlations. Therefore further measurements of F_2A(x) in that\nregion and for many nuclei would be most welcome.\n", "  The influence of correlations on the momentum distribution of nucleons in\nnuclei is evaluated starting from a realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction. The\ncalculations are performed directly for the finite nucleus $\\,^{16}$O making\nuse of the Green's function approach. The emphasis is focused on the\ncorrelations induced by the excitation modes at low energies described within a\nmodel-space of shell-model configurations including states up to the sdg shell.\nOur analysis demonstrates that these long-range correlations do not produce any\nsignificant enhancement of the momentum distribution at high missing momenta\nand low missing energies. This is in agreement with high resolution $(e,e'p)$\nexperiments for this nucleus. We also try to simulate the corresponding effects\nin large nuclei by quenching the energy-spacing between single-particle orbits.\nThis yields a sizable enhancement of the spectral function at large momenta and\nsmall energy. Such behavior could explain the deviation of the momentum\ndistribution from the mean field prediction, which has been observed in\n$(e,e'p)$ experiments on heavy nuclei like $^{208}$Pb.\n", "  We demonstrate that the partial wave decomposition of three-nucleon forces\nused up to now in momentum space has to be necessarily unstable at high partial\nwaves. This does not affect the applications performed up to now, which were\nrestricted to low partial waves. We present a new way to perform the partial\nwave decomposition which is free of that defect. This is exemplified for the\nmost often used $2\\pi$-exchange Tuscon-Melbourne three-nucleon force. For the\nlower partial waves the results of the old method are reproduced.\n", "  Due to the internal structure of the nucleon, we should expect, in general,\nthat the effective meson nucleon parameters may change in nuclear medium. We\nstudy such changes by using a chiral confining model of the nucleon. We use\ndensity-dependent masses for all mesons except the pion. Within a\nDirac-Brueckner analysis, based on the relativistic covariant structure of the\nNN amplitude, we show that the effect of such a density dependence in the NN\ninteraction on the saturation properties of nuclear matter, while not large, is\nquite significant. Due to the density dependence of the $g_{\\sigma NN}$, as\npredicted by the chiral confining model, we find, in particular, a looping\nbehavior of the binding energy at saturation as a function of the saturation\ndensity. A simple model is described, which exhibits looping and which is shown\nto be mainly caused by the presence of a peak in the density dependence of the\nmedium modified $\\sigma N$ coupling constant at low density.\n  The effect of density dependence of the coupling constants and the meson\nmasses tends to improve the results for $E/A$ and density of nuclear matter at\nsaturation. From the present study we see that the relationship between binding\nenergy and saturation density may not be as universal as found in\nnonrelativistic studies and that more model dependence is exhibited once medium\nmodifications of the basic nuclear interactions are considered.\n", "  We show that lepton-pair production in Virtual Compton Scattering offers,\nthrough interference with the well-known Bethe-Heitler process, a sensitive\nprobe to learn the longitudinal response of resonances and the electromagnetic\nnucleon form factors. This interference can be measured directly in terms of an\nasymmetry. The role of off-shell effects in the N-N-$\\gamma$ vertices is\ninvestigated as well. An additional N-N-$\\gamma -\\gamma$ contact term in the\namplitude, included to ensure gauge invariance of the model, cancels a\nsubstantial part of the off-shell effects.\n", "  For a $Q \\cdot Q$ interaction the energy weighted sum rule for isovector\norbital magnetic dipole transitions is proportional to the difference $\\sum\nB(E2, isoscalar) - \\sum B(E2, isovector)$, not just to $\\sum B(E2, physical)$.\nThis fact is important in ensuring that one gets the correct limit as one goes\nto nuclei, some of which are far from stability, for which one shell (neutron\nor proton) is closed. In $0p$ shell calculations for the even-even Be isotopes\nit is shown that the Fermion SU(3) model and Boson SU(3) model give different\nresults for the energy weighted scissors mode strengths.\n", "  The cross-section for threshold $\\pi^0$ production in proton-proton\ncollisions is evaluated in the framework of the covariant spectator\ndescription. The negative energy intermediate states are included\nnon-perturbatively and seen to yield a considerably smaller contribution, when\ncompared to perturbative treatments. A family of OBE-models with different\noff-shell scalar coupling is considered.\n", "  The energies and transition rates to $J=1^{+} T=1$ and $J=2^{+} T=0,1$ states\nin ^{12}C with matrix elements fitted to realistic $G$ matrix elements obtained\nin non-relativistic approaches are studied. Then the effects of varying the\nstrengths of the two-body tensor and spin-orbit interactions are also\nconsidered. The calculations are done in both a small space (0p) and a large\nspace (0p + $2\\hbar\\omega$). In the small space the B(M1) from ground to the\n$J=1^{+} T=1$ is enhanced and gets closer to experiment if the strength of the\nspin-orbit interaction is increased and/or if that of the tensor interaction is\nmade weaker. In a large space the spin B(M1) gets reduced by almost a factor of\ntwo. A `self-weakening' mechanism for the tensor interaction which succeeded in\nexplaining anomalies in other nuclei does not seem to work for this case.\n", "  We consider several nuclear fusion reactions that take place at the center of\nthe sun, which are omitted in the standard pp-chain model. More specifically\nthe reaction rates of the nonradiative production of ^3He, ^7Be, and ^8B nuclei\nin triple collisions involving electrons are estimated within the framework of\nthe adiabatic approximation. These rates are compared with those of the\ncorresponding binary fusion reactions.\n", "  A self-consistent relativistic integral-differential equation of the\nBoltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck-type for the $N^{*}$(1440) resonance is developed\nbased on an effective Lagrangian of baryons interacting through mesons. The\nclosed time-path Green's function technique and semi-classical, quasi-particle\nand Born approximations are employed in the derivation. The non-equilibrium\nRBUU-type equation for the $N^{*}$(1440) is consistent with that of nucleon's\nand delta's which we derived before. Thus, we obtain a set of coupled equations\nfor the $N$, $\\Delta$ and $N^{*}$(1440) distribution functions.\n  All the $N^{*}$(1440)-relevant in-medium two-body scattering cross sections\nwithin the $N$, $\\Delta$ and $N^{*}$(1440) system are derived from the same\neffective Lagrangian in addition to the mean field and presented analytically,\nwhich can be directly used in the study of relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\nThe theoretical prediction of the free $pp \\to pp^{*}(1440)$ cross section is\nin good agreement with the experimental data. We calculate the in-medium $N + N\n\\to N + N^{*}$, $N^{*} + N \\to N + N$ and $N^{*} + N \\to N^{*} + N$ cross\nsections in cold nuclear matter up to twice the nuclear matter density. The\ninfluence of different choices of the $N^{*}N^{*}$ coupling strengths, which\ncan not be obtained through fitting certain experimental data, are discussed.\nThe results show that the density dependence of predicted in-medium cross\nsections are sensitive to the $N^{*}N^{*}$ coupling strengths used. An evident\ndensity dependence will appear when a large scalar coupling strength of\n$g_{N^{*}N^{*}}^{\\sigma}$ is assumed.\n", "  Using a relativistic Dirac-Brueckner analysis the pion contribution to the\nground state energy of nuclear matter is studied. Evidence is presented that\nthe role of the tensor force in the saturation mechanism is substantially\nreduced compared to its dominant role in a usual non-relativistic treatment.\nThe reduction of the pion contribution in nuclear matter is due to many-body\neffects present in a relativistic treatment. In particular, we show that the\ndamping of OPEP is actually due to the decrease of $M^*/M$ with increasing\ndensity.\n", "  The $\\Lambda$-$\\Lambda$ effective interaction, in the channel $L=S=0$, in the\nnuclear medium is fitted to the available binding energies,\n$B_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}$, of double $\\Lambda$ hypernuclei:\n$^{6}_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}$He, $^{10}_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}$Be and\n$^{13}_{\\Lambda\\Lambda}$B. The mesonic decay of these hypernuclei is also\ninvestigated. Finally, this effective interaction is used to predict the\nbinding energies and mesonic decays widths of heavier double $\\Lambda$\nhypernuclei.\n", "  Dielectron mass spectra are examined for various nuclear reactions recently\nmeasured by the DLS collaboration. A detailed description is given of all\ndilepton channels included in the transport model UrQMD 1.0, i.e. Dalitz decays\nof $\\pi^0,\\eta,\\omega,\\eta'$ mesons and of the $\\Delta(1232)$ resonance, direct\ndecays of vector mesons and $pn$ bremsstrahlung. The microscopic calculations\nreproduce data for light systems fairly well, but tend to underestimate the\ndata in $pp$ at high energies and in $pd$ at low energies. These conventional\nsources, however, cannot explain the recently reported enhancement for\nnucleus-nucleus collisions in the mass region 0.15 GeV<$M_{ee}$<0.6 GeV. Chiral\nscaling and $\\omega$ meson broadening in the medium are investigated as a\nsource of this mass excess. They also cannot explain the recent DLS data.\n", "  We derive the relativistic quantum transport equation for the pion\ndistribution function based on an effective Lagrangian of the QHD-II model. The\nclosed time-path Green's function technique, the semi-classical, quasi-particle\nand Born approximation are employed in the derivation. Both the mean field and\ncollision term are derived from the same Lagrangian and presented analytically.\nThe dynamical equation for the pions is consistent with that for the nucleons\nand deltas which we developed before. Thus, we obtain a relativistic transport\nmodel which describes the hadronic matter with $N$, $\\Delta$ and $\\pi$ degrees\nof freedom simultaneously. Within this approach, we investigate the medium\neffects on the pion dispersion relation as well as the pion absorption and pion\nproduction channels in cold nuclear matter. In contrast to the results of the\nnon-relativistic model, the pion dispersion relation becomes harder at low\nmomenta and softer at high momenta as compared to the free one, which is mainly\ncaused by the relativistic kinetics. The theoretically predicted free $\\pi N\n\\to \\Delta$ cross section is in agreement with the experimental data. Medium\neffects on the $\\pi N \\to \\Delta$ cross section and momentum-dependent\n$\\Delta$-decay width are shown to be substantial.\n", "  We study elastic N$\\alpha $ scattering and produce a quantitative correlation\nbetween the range of the effective potential and the energy of the system. This\nallows the identification of the waves and energies for which the scattering\nmay be said to be peripheral. We then show that the corresponding phase shifts\nare sensitive to the tail of the NN potential, which is due to the exchange of\ntwo pions. However, the present uncertainties in the experimental phase shifts\nprevent the use of N$\\alpha $ scattering to discriminate the existing models\nfor the NN interaction.\n", "  A new chiral SU(3) Lagrangian is proposed to describe the properties of kaons\nand antikaons in the nuclear medium, the ground state of dense matter and the\nkaon-nuclear interactions consistently.\n  The saturation properties of nuclear matter are reproduced as well as the\nresults of the Dirac-Br\\\"{u}ckner theory. Our numerical results show that the\nkaon effective mass might be changed only moderately in the nuclear medium due\nto the highly non-linear density effects. After taking into account the\ncoupling between the omega meson and the kaon, we obtain similar results for\nthe effective kaon and antikaon energies as calculated in the\none-boson-exchange model while in our model the parameters of the kaon-nuclear\ninteractions are constrained by the SU(3) chiral symmetry.\n", "  We discuss the symmetry of the parameter space of the interacting boson model\n(IBM). It is shown that for any set of the IBM Hamiltonian parameters (with the\nonly exception of the U(5) dynamical symmetry limit) one can always find\nanother set that generates the equivalent spectrum. We discuss the origin of\nthe symmetry and its relevance for physical applications.\n", "  The renormalized elastic $\\pi\\pi$ scattering amplitude to one loop is\ncalculated in the chiral limit in the $\\sigma$ model and in a Quantum\nHadrodynamic model (QHD-III) with vector mesons. It is argued that QHD-III\nreduces to the linear $\\sigma$ model in the limit that the vector meson masses\nbecome large. The pion decay constant is also calculated to 1-loop in the\n$\\sigma$ model, and at tree level in QHD-III; it is shown that the coefficient\nof the tree level term in the scattering amplitude equals $F_\\pi^{-2}$. The\n1-loop correction of $F_\\pi$ in QHD-III violates strong isospin current\nconservation. Thus,it is concluded that QHD-III can, at best, only describe the\nstrongly interacting nuclear sector.\n", "  A new chiral SU(3) Lagrangian is proposed to describe the properties of kaons\nand anti-kaons in the nuclear medium. The saturation properties of nuclear\nmatter are reproduced as well as the results of the Dirac-Br\\\"{u}ckner theory.\nAfter introducing the coupling between the omega meson and the kaon, our\nresults for effective kaon and anti-kaon energy are quite similar as calculated\nin the one-boson-exchange model.\n", "  We investigate event-by-event fluctuations for ensembles with non-fixed\nmultiplicity. Moments of event observable distributions, like total energy\ndistribution, total transverse momentum distribution, etc, are shown to be\nrelated to the multi-body correlations present in the system. For classical\nsystems, these moments reduce in the absence of any correlations to the moments\nof particle inclusive momentum distribution. As a consequence, a zero value for\nthe recently introduced $\\Phi$-variable is shown to indicate the vanishing of\ntwo-body correlations from one part, and of correlations between multiplicity\nand momentum distributions from the other part. It is often misunderstood as a\nmeasure of the degree of equilibration in the system.\n", "  We develop a relativistic model to describe the bound states of positive\nenergy and negative energy in finite nuclei at the same time. Instead of\nsearching for the negative-energy solution of the nucleon's Dirac equation, we\nsolve the Dirac equations for the nucleon and the anti-nucleon simultaneously.\nThe single-particle energies of negative-energy nucleons are obtained through\nchanging the sign of the single-particle energies of positive-energy\nanti-nucleons. The contributions of the Dirac sea to the source terms of the\nmeson fields are evaluated by means of the derivative expansion up to the\nleading derivative order for the one-meson loop and one-nucleon loop. After\nrefitting the parameters of the model to the properties of spherical nuclei,\nthe results of positive-energy sector are similar to that calculated within the\ncommonly used relativistic mean field theory under the no-sea approximation.\nHowever, the bound levels of negative-energy nucleons vary drastically when the\nvacuum contributions are taken into account. It implies that the\nnegative-energy spectra deserve a sensitive probe to the effective interactions\nin addition to the positive-energy spectra.\n", "  The production and thermalization of partons liberated in relativistic heavy\nioncollisions is investigated within the parton cascade model. The momentum\ndistribution of the partons near z=0 is found to become isotropic beyond about\n1 fm/c after the overlap for the collision of lead nuclei at $\\sqrt{s}=20 A\nGeV$ indicating a thermalization. At $\\sqrt{s}=200 A GeV$ this is attained by\nabout 0.5 fm/c after the complete overlap.\n", "  The production of single photons in relativistic heavy ion collisions at CERN\nSPS, BNL RHIC and CERN LHC energies is re-examined in view of the recent\nstudies of Aurenche et al which show that the rate of photon production from\nquark gluon plasma, evaluated at the order of two loops far exceeds the rates\nevaluated at one-loop level which have formed the basis of all the estimates of\nphotons so far. We find that the production of photons from quark matter could\neasily out-shine those from the hadronic matter in certain ideal conditions.\n", "  Effective density dependent pairing forces of zero range are adjusted on gap\nvalues in T=0,1 channels calculated with the Paris force in symmetric nuclear\nmatter. General discussions on the pairing force are presented. In conjunction\nwith the effective k-mass the nuclear pairing force seems to need very little\nrenormalization in the T=1 channel. The situation in the T=0 channel is also\ndiscussed.\n", "  We make a systematic examination of the role played by the restriction that\nthe cross section in polarized coincidence electronuclear processes must be\npositive. The necessary formalism for unpolarized scattering structure\nfunctions is developed within two frameworks: (i) the response tensor method;\nand (ii) the Jacob-Wick method. Equivalence of the two methods is demonstrated\nfor unpolarized scattering, and then the simpler Jacob-Wick method is applied\nto the polarized pseudoscalar electroproduction off a nucleon. We derive three\nknown and eight new inequalities among the polarized target structure\nfunctions, as well as eleven new polarized ejectile structure functions\ninequalities. We also provide rules for this method to be used in deuteron\ntwo-body electrodisintegration in conjunction with the results published in\nPhys. Rev. C 40, 2479 (1989).\n", "  We show for the first time that highly localized in-plane breathers can\npropagate in specific directions with minimal lateral spreading in a model 2-D\nhexagonal non-linear lattice. The lattice is subject to an on-site potential in\naddition to longitudinal nonlinear inter-particle interactions. This study\ninvestigates the prediction that stable breather-like solitons could be formed\nas a result of energetic scattering events in a given layered crystal and would\npropagate in atomic-chain directions in certain atomic planes. This prediction\narose from a long-term study of previously unexplained dark lines in natural\ncrystals of muscovite mica.\n", "  The momentum representation is seldom used in quantum mechanics courses. Some\nstudents are thence surprised by the change in viewpoint when, in doing\nadvanced work, they have to use the momentum rather than the coordinate\nrepresentation. In this work, we give an introduction to quantum mechanics in\nmomentum space, where the Schr\\\"odinger equation becomes an integral equation.\nTo this end we discuss standard problems, namely, the free particle, the\nquantum motion under a constant potential, a particle interacting with a\npotential step, and the motion of a particle under a harmonic potential. What\nis not so standard is that they are all conceived from momentum space and hence\nthey, with the exception of the free particle, are not equivalent to the\ncoordinate space ones with the same names. All the problems are solved within\nthe momentum representation making no reference to the systems they correspond\nto in the coordinate representation.\n", "  The design of a detector based on MICROMEGAS (MICRO MEsh GAseous Structure)\ntechnology is presented. Our detector is characterized by a large active area\nof 398(\\times)281 mm(^{2}), a pad read-out with 20(\\times)22 mm(^{2})\nsegmentation, and an uniform amplification gap obtained by insulating spacers\n(100 (\\mu)m high and 200 (\\mu)m in diameter). The performances of several\nprototypes have been evaluated under irradiation with secondary beams of 2\nGeV/c momentum charged pions and electrons. We consider such a detector as the\nbasic element for a pre-shower detector to equip the PHOton Spectrometer (PHOS)\nof the ALICE experiment. Its assets are modularity, small amount of material,\nrobustness and low cost.\n", "  Using computer simulations of two charged colloidal spheres with their\ncounterions in a hard sphere solvent, we show that the granular nature of the\nsolvent significantly influences the effective colloidal interaction. For\ndivalent counterions, the total effective force can become attractive generated\nby counterion hydration, while for monovalent counterions the forces are\nrepulsive and well-described by a solvent-induced colloidal charge\nrenormalization. Both effects are not contained in the traditional \"primitive\"\napproaches but can be accounted for in a solvent-averaged primitive model.\n", "  The multiply differential cross section of the ionization of hydrogen\nmolecular ion by fast electron impact is calculated by a direct approach, which\ninvolves the reduction of the initial 6D Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation to a 3D\nevolution problem followed by the modeling of the wave packet dynamics. This\napproach avoids the use of stationary Coulomb two-centre functions of the\ncontinuous spectrum of the ejected electron which demands cumbersome\ncalculations. The results obtained, after verification of the procedure in the\ncase atomic hydrogen, reveal interesting mechanisms in the case of small\nscattering angles.\n", "  Quantum optical techniques may yield immersion fluids with high indices of\nrefraction without absorption. We describe one such technique in which a probe\nfield experiences a large index of refraction with amplification rather than\nabsorption, and examine its practicality for an immersion lithography\napplication. Enhanced index can be observed in a three-level system with a\ntunable, near-resonant, coherent probe and incoherent pump field that inverts\npopulation of the probe transition. This observation contradicts the common\nbelief that large indices of refraction are impossible without absorption,\nhowever it is well in accord with existing electromagnetic theory and practice.\nCalculations show that a refractive index >> 2 is possible with practical\nexperimental parameters. A scheme with an incoherent mixture of pumped and\nunpumped atoms is also examined, and is seen to have a lower refractive index\n(~2) accompanied by neither gain nor loss.\n", "  We show that the degeneracy parameter of a trapped Bose gas can be changed\nadiabatically in a reversible way, both in the Boltzmann regime and in the\ndegenerate Bose regime. We have performed measurements on spin-polarized atomic\nhydrogen in the Boltzmann regime demonstrating reversible changes of the\ndegeneracy parameter (phase-space density) by more than a factor of two. This\nresult is in perfect agreement with theory. By extending our theoretical\nanalysis to the quantum degenerate regime we predict that, starting close\nenough to the Bose-Einstein phase transition, one can cross the transition by\nan adiabatic change of the trap shape.\n", "  In this paper, we study Lie superalgebras of $2\\times 2$ matrix-valued\nfirst-order differential operators on the complex line. We first completely\nclassify all such superalgebras of finite dimension. Among the\nfinite-dimensional superalgebras whose odd subspace is nontrivial, we find\nthose admitting a finite-dimensional invariant module of smooth vector-valued\nfunctions, and classify all the resulting finite-dimensional modules. The\nlatter Lie superalgebras and their modules are the building blocks in the\nconstruction of QES quantum mechanical models for spin 1/2 particles in one\ndimension.\n", "  We find exact solutions of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation for a\nfamily of quasi-exactly solvable time-dependent potentials by means of\nnon-unitary gauge transformations.\n", "  We discuss the phenomenon of preacceleration in the light of a method of\nsuccessive approximations used to construct the physical order reduction of a\nlarge class of singular equations. A simple but illustrative physical example\nis analyzed to get more insight into the convergence properties of the method.\n", "  We present ionization probability and line shape calculations for the\ntwo-step 3-photon ionization process, $1S \\stackrel{2\\hbar\n\\omega}{\\longrightarrow}2S \\stackrel{\\hbar \\omega}{\\longrightarrow}\\epsilon P\n$, of the ground state of hydrogenic atoms in a non-monochromatic laser field\nwith a time--dependent amplitude. Within the framework of a three--level model,\nthe {\\it AC Stark} shifts and non-zero ionization rates of all states involved\nwere taken into account together with spatial and temporal inhomogeneities of\nthe laser signal. In contrast with the usual perturbative technique, the time\nevolution of the atomic states was simulated by direct numerically solving the\nsystem of coupled time--dependent inhomogeneous differential equations, being\nequivalent to the appropriate non-stationary Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation.\nParticular numerical results were obtained for typical parameters of the pulsed\nlaser field that are employed in a new experiment to measure the $1S-2S$ energy\nseparation in muonium at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. The shifts and\nasymmetries of the photoionization line shapes revealed may be of relevance for\nultra-high precision experiments in hydrogen in CW laser fields.\n", "  We present the results of the light-shift calculations in the ns-states of\nhydrogenicsystems in the presence of a weak laser field. This is done by means\nof analytical calculations of the scalar dynamic polarizabilities (DP) of the\ncorresponding levels. In contrast to the usual technique, 1.e. by solving\ncertain inhomogeneous differential equation. As a result, we obtained for the\nDP a closed analytical expression valid for all principal quantum numbers, n.\nWithin a framework of such an approach we succeeded both in retrieving the well\nknown results and finding several new ones, as well.Our interest is focused\nmainly on the states with low n, n=1,2, since they are of particular\nimportance.Various analytical properties of the DP of such levels are discussed\nin full details. Numerical values of light-shifts are computed for those\nenergies and intensities of the laser field that are used in the 1S-2S\nexperimental investigation of the muonium atom.\n", "  A theoretical approach is developed to quantify hydrophobic hydration and\ninteractions on a molecular scale, with the goal of gaining insight into the\nmolecular origins of hydrophobic effects. The model is based on the fundamental\nrelation between the probability for cavity formation in bulk water resulting\nfrom molecular-scale density fluctuations, and the hydration free energy of the\nsimplest hydrophobic solute, a hard particle. This probability is estimated\nusing an information theory (IT) approach, incorporating experimentally\navailable properties of bulk water -- the density and radial distribution\nfunction. The IT approach reproduces the simplest hydrophobic effects:\nhydration of spherical nonpolar solutes, the potential of mean force between\nmethane molecules, and solvent contributions to the torsional equilibrium of\nbutane. Applications of this approach to study temperature and pressure effects\nprovide new insights into the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein folding.\nThe IT model relates the hydrophobic-entropy convergence observed in protein\nunfolding experiments to the macroscopic isothermal compressibility of water. A\nnovel explanation for pressure denaturation of proteins follows from an\nanalysis of the pressure stability of hydrophobic aggregates, suggesting that\nwater penetrates the hydrophobic core of proteins at high pressures. This\nresolves a long-standing puzzle, whether pressure denaturation contradicts the\nhydrophobic-core model of protein stability. Finally, issues of ``dewetting''\nof molecularly large nonpolar solutes are discussed in the context of a\nrecently developed perturbation theory approach.\n", "  The short-time dynamics of correlated systems is strongly influenced by\ninitial correlations giving rise to an additional collision integral in the\nnon-Markovian kinetic equation. Exact cancellation of the two integrals is\nfound if the initial state is thermal equilibrium which is an important\nconsistency criterion. Analytical results are given for the time evolution of\nthe correlation energy which are confirmed by comparisons with molecular\ndynamics simulations (MD).\n", "  We define the concept of higher order differential operators on a general\nnoncommutative, nonassociative superalgebra A, and show that a vertex operator\nsuperalgebra has plenty of them, namely modes of vertex operators. A linear\noperator \\Delta is a differential operator of order at most r if an inductively\ndefined (r+1)-form \\Phi_{\\Delta}^{r+1} is identically zero. When A is\nsupercommutative and associative and \\Delta is an odd, square zero, second\norder differential operator on A, \\Phi_{\\Delta}^2 defines a \"Batalin-Vilkovisky\nalgebra\" structure on A. We generalize this notion to any superalgebra with an\nodd, square zero, second order differential operator, and show that all\nproperties of the classical BV bracket but one continue to hold \"on the nose\".\nWe also point out connections to Leibniz algebras and the noncommutative\nhomology theory of Loday. Taking the generalization process one step further,\nwe remove all conditions on \\Delta to examine the changes in the basic\nproperties of the bracket. We see that a topological chiral algebra with a mild\nrestriction yields a classical BV algebra in the cohomology. Finally, we\ninvestigate the quantum BV master equation and relate it to deformations of\ndifferential graded algebras.\n", "  Lattice current algebras were introduced as a regularization of the left- and\nright moving degrees of freedom in the WZNW model. They provide examples of\nlattice theories with a local quantum symmetry $U_q(\\sg)$. Their representation\ntheory is studied in detail. In particular, we construct all irreducible\nrepresentations along with a lattice analogue of the fusion product for\nrepresentations of the lattice current algebra. It is shown that for an\narbitrary number of lattice sites, the representation categories of the lattice\ncurrent algebras agree with their continuum counterparts.\n", "  We prove that the scalar and $2\\times 2$ matrix differential operators which\npreserve the simplest scalar and vector-valued polynomial modules in two\nvariables have a fundamental Lie algebraic structure. Our approach is based on\na general graphical method which does not require the modules to be irreducible\nunder the action of the corresponding Lie (super)algebra. This method can be\ngeneralized to modules of polynomials in an arbitrary number of variables. We\ngive generic examples of partially solvable differential operators which are\nnot Lie algebraic. We show that certain vector-valued modules give rise to new\nrealizations of finite-dimensional Lie superalgebras by first-order\ndifferential operators.\n", "  We provide a physical prescription based on interferometry for introducing\nthe total phase of a mixed state undergoing unitary evolution, which has been\nan elusive concept in the past. We define the parallel transport condition that\nprovides a connection-form for obtaining the geometric phase for mixed states.\nThe expression for the geometric phase for mixed state reduces to well known\nformulas in the pure state case when a system undergoes noncyclic and unitary\nquantum evolution.\n", "  Experimental NMR implementations of the Deutsch-Josza quantum algorithm based\non pesudo-pure spin states exhibit an exponential sensitivity scaling with the\nnumber of qubits. By employing truly mixed spin states in spin Liouville space,\nwhere molecules with different nuclear spin configurations represent different\ninput states, the Deutsch-Josza problem can be solved by single function\nevaluation without sensitivity loss concomitant with increase of the number of\nbits.\n", "  We study measurements on various subsystems of the output of a universal 1 to\n2 cloning machine, and establish a correspondence between these measurements at\nthe output and effective measurements on the original input. We show that one\ncan implement sharp effective measurement elements by measuring only two out of\nthe three output systems. Additionally, certain complete sets of sharp\nmeasurements on the input can be realised by measurements on the two clones.\nFurthermore, we introduce a scheme that allows to restore the original input in\none of the output bits, by using measurements and classical communication -- a\nprotocol that resembles teleportation.\n", "  Spontaneous decay of an excited atom near a dispersing and absorbing\nmicrosphere of given complex permittivity that satisfies the Kramers-Kronig\nrelations is studied, with special emphasis on a Drude-Lorentz permittivity.\nBoth the whispering gallery field resonances below the band gap (for a\ndielectric sphere) and the surface-guided field resonances inside the gap (for\na dielectric or a metallic sphere) are considered. Since the decay rate mimics\nthe spectral density of the sphere-assisted ground-state fluctuation of the\nradiation field, the strengths and widths of the field resonances essentially\ndetermine the feasible enhancement of spontaneous decay. In particular, strong\nenhancement can be observed for transition frequencies within the interval in\nwhich the surface-guided field resonances strongly overlap. When material\nabsorption becomes significant, then the highly structured emission pattern\nthat can be observed when radiative losses dominate reduces to that of a\nstrongly absorbing mirror. Accordingly, nonradiative decay becomes dominant. In\nparticular, if the distance between the atom and the surface of the microsphere\nis small enough, the decay becomes purely nonradiative.\n", "  We prove a powerful scaling property for the extremality condition in the\nrecently developed variational perturbation theory which converts divergent\nperturbation expansions into exponentially fast convergent ones. The proof is\ngiven for the energy eigenvalues of an anharmonic oscillator with an arbitrary\n$x^p$-potential. The scaling property greatly increases the accuracy of the\nresults.\n", "  As an application of a recently developed variational perturbation theory we\nfind the first 22 terms of the convergent strong-coupling series expansion for\nthe ground state energy of the quartic anharmonic oscillator.\n", "  Variational perturbation theory is used to determine the decay rates of\nmetastable states across a cubic barrier of arbitrary height. For high\nbarriers, a variational resummation procedure is applied to the complex energy\neigenvalues obtained from a WKB expansion; for low barriers, the variational\nresummation procedure converts the non-Borel-summable\nRayleigh-Schr\\\"o\\-din\\-ger expansion into an exponentially fast convergent one.\nThe results in the two regimes match and yield very accurate imaginary parts of\nthe energy eigenvalues. This is demonstrated by comparison with the complex\neigenvalues from solutions of the Schr\\\"odinger equation via the\ncomplex-coordinate rotation method.\n", "  The quantum Langevin equation is derived from the Feynman-Veron\nforward--backward path integral representation for a density matrix of a\nquantum system in a thermal oscillator bath. We exhibit the mechanism by which\nthe classical, $c$-valued noise in the Feynman-Vernon theory turns into an\noperator-valued quantum noise fulfilling characteristic commutation relation\nnecessary for the unitarity of the time evolution in the quantum Langevin\nequation.\n", "  We show that the particle motion in Bohmian mechanics, given by the solution\nof an ordinary differential equation, exists globally: For a large class of\npotentials the singularities of the velocity field and infinity will not be\nreached in finite time for typical initial values. A substantial part of the\nanalysis is based on the probabilistic significance of the quantum flux. We\nelucidate the connection between the conditions necessary for global existence\nand the self-adjointness of the Schr\\\"odinger Hamiltonian.\n", "  The content of phase information of an arbitrary phase--sensitive measurement\nis evaluated using the maximum likelihood estimation. The phase distribution is\ncharacterized by the relative entropy--a nonlinear functional of input quantum\nstate. As an explicit example the multiple measurement of quadrature operator\nis interpreted as quantum phase detection achieving the ultimate resolution\npredicted by the Fisher information.\n", "  We study a generalization of Aharonov-Bohm effect, the potential effect. The\ndiscussion is focused on field-free effects in simply connected region, which\nobviously can not have any local field-flux. Among the published discussions\nabout this kind of effects, it is generally agreed that this kind of effects\ndoes not exist due to gauge invariance. However, there are also opinions that\nthis effect is a trivial variation of Aharonov-Bohm effect and therefore there\nis no need to check its existence. To my knowledge, it has never been tested.\nMy first goal here is to supply enough theoretical reason to motivate the\nexperimental test of this effect. I start with an intuitive derivation, then I\nintroduce a wave-front theory as a theoretical consideration. Logically, the\nexistence of potential effect implies the existence of the AB effect, but not\nvice versa. The purpose of this paper is to provide a physical connection in\nthe opposite direction.\n", "  The importance of the potential is revealed in a newly discovered effect of\nthe potential. This paper explore the same issue introduced in quant-ph/9506038\nfrom several different aspects including electron optics and relativity. Some\npeople fail to recognize this effect due to a wrong application of gauge\ninvariance.\n", "  Given the collapse hypothesis (CH) of quantum measurement, EPR-type\ncorrelations along with the hypothesis of the impossibility of superluminal\ncommunication (ISC) have the effect of globalizing gross features of the\nquantum formalism making them universally true. In particular, these hypotheses\nimply that state transformations of density matrices must be linear and that\nevolution which preserves purity of states must also be linear. A gedanken\nexperiment shows that lorentz covariance along with the second law of\nthermodynamics imply a non-entropic version of ISC. Partial results using\nquantum logic suggest, given ISC and a version of CH, a connection between\nlorentz covariance and the covering law. These results show that standard\nquantum mechanics is structurally unstable, and suggest that viable\nrelativistic alternatives must question CH. One may also speculate that some\nfeatures of the hilbert-space model of quantum mechanics have their origin in\nspace-time structure.\n", "  A new totally algebraic formalism based on general, abstract ladder operators\nhas been proposed. This approach heavily grounds in the superoperator formalism\nof Primas. However it is necessary to introduce many improvements in his\nformalism. In this regard, it has been introduced a new set of superoperators\nfeatured by their algebraic structure. Also, two lemmas and one theorem have\nbeen developed in order to algebraically reformulate the theory on more\nrigorous grounds. Finally, we have been able to build a coherent and\nself-contained formalism independent on any matricial representation , removing\nin this way the degeneracy problem .\n", "  We suggest as gedanken experiment a generalization of the Aharonov-Bohm\nexperiment, based on an array of solenoids. This experiment allows in principle\nto measure the decomposition into homotopy classes of the quantum mechanical\npropagator. This yields information on the geometry of the average path of\npropagation and allows to determine its Hausdorff dimension.\n", "  We make a proposal for a Gedanken experiment, based on the Aharonov-Bohm\neffect, how to measure in principle the zig-zagness of the trajectory of\npropagation (abberation from its classical trajectory) of a massive particle in\nquantum mechanics. Experiment I is conceived to show that contributions from\nquantum paths abberating from the classical trajectory are directly observable.\nExperiment II is conceived to measure average length, scaling behavior and\ncritical exponent (Hausdorff dimension) of quantum mechanical paths.\n", "  The effect of entangling evolution induced by frequently repeated quantum\nmeasurement is presented. The interesting possibility of conditional freezing\nthe system in maximally entangled state out of Zeno effect regime is also\nrevealed. The illustration of the phenomena in terms of dynamical version of\n``interaction free'' measurement is presented. Some general conclusions are\nprovided.\n", "  The superposition principle is a very basic ingredient of quantum theory.\nWhat may come as a surprise to many students, and even to many practitioners of\nthe quantum craft, is tha superposition has limitations imposed by certain\nrequirements of the theory. The discussion of such limitations arising from the\nso-called superselection rules is the main purpose of this paper. Some of their\nprincipal consequences are also discussed. The univalence, mass and particle\nnumber superselection rules of non-relativistic quantum mechanics are also\nderived using rather simple methods.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the possibility to make complete Bell\nmeasurements on a product Hilbert space of two two-level bosonic systems. We\nrestrict our tools to linear elements, like beam splitters and phase shifters,\ndelay lines and electronically switched linear elements, photo-detectors, and\nauxiliary bosons. As a result we show that with these tools a never failing\nBell measurement is impossible.\n", "  By introducing the shape invariant Lie algebra spanned by the SUSY ladder\noperators plus the unity operator, a new basis is presented for the quantum\ntreatment of the one-dimensional Morse potential. In this discrete, complete\northonormal set, which we call the pseudo number states, the Morse Hamiltonian\nis tridiagonal. By using this basis we construct coherent states algebraically\nfor the Morse potential, in a close analogy with the harmonic oscillator. We\nalso show that there exists an unitary displacement operator creating these\ncoherent states from the ground state. We show that our coherent states form a\ncontinuous and overcomplete set of states. They coincide with a class of states\nconstructed earlier by Nieto and Simmons by using the coordinate\nrepresentation. \\pacs{3.65.Fd, 02.20.Sv, 42.50.-p}\n", "  When a surface wave interacts with a vertical vortex in shallow water the\nlatter induces a dislocation in the incident wavefronts that is analogous to\nwhat happens in the Aharonov-Bohm effect for the scattering of electrons by a\nconfined magnetic field. In addition to this global similarity between these\ntwo physical systems there is scattering. This paper reports a detailed\ncalculation of this scattering, which is quantitatively different from the\nelectronic case in that a surface wave penetrates the inside of a vortex while\nelectrons do not penetrate a solenoid. This difference, together with an\nadditional difference in the equations that govern both physical systems lead\nto a quite different scattering in the case of surface waves, whose main\ncharacteristic is a strong asymmetry in the scattering cross section. The\nassumptions and approximations under which these effects happen are carefully\nconsidered, and their applicability to the case of scattering of acoustic waves\nby vorticity is noted.\n", "  Previous results on the scattering of surface waves by vertical vorticity on\nshallow water are generalized to the case of dispersive water waves. Dispersion\neffects are treated perturbatively around the shallow water limit, to first\norder in the ratio of depth to wavelength. The dislocation of the incident\nwavefront, analogous to the Aharonov-Bohm effect, is still observed. At short\nwavelengths the scattering is qualitatively similar to the nondispersive case.\nAt moderate wavelengths, however, there are two markedly different scattering\nregimes according to wether the capillary length is smaller or larger than\n$\\sqrt{3}$ times depth. The dislocation is characterized by a parameter that\ndepends both on phase and group velocity. The validity range of the calculation\nis the same as in the shallow water case: wavelengths small compared to vortex\nradius, and low Mach number. The implications of these limitations are\ncarefully considered.\n", "  We present a perturbation theory for non-Markovian quantum state diffusion\n(QSD), the theory of diffusive quantum trajectories for open systems in a\nbosonic environment [Physical Review {\\bf A 58}, 1699, (1998)]. We establish a\nsystematic expansion in the ratio between the environmental correlation time\nand the typical system time scale. The leading order recovers the Markov\ntheory, so here we concentrate on the next-order correction corresponding to\nfirst-order non-Markovian master equations. These perturbative equations\ngreatly simplify the general non-Markovian QSD approach, and allow for\nefficient numerical simulations beyond the Markov approximation. Furthermore,\nwe show that each perturbative scheme for QSD naturally gives rise to a\nperturbative scheme for the master equation which we study in some detail.\nAnalytical and numerical examples are presented, including the quantum Brownian\nmotion model.\n", "  The Casimir energy for a compact dielectric sphere is considered in a novel\nway, using the quantum statistical method introduced by H\\oye - Stell and\nothers. Dilute media are assumed. It turns out that this method is a very\npowerful one: we are actually able to derive an expression for the Casimir\nenergy that contains also the negative part resulting from the attractive van\nder Waals forces between the molecules. It is precisely this part of the\nCasimir energy that has turned out to be so difficult to extract from the\nformalism when using the conventional field theoretical methods for a\ncontinuous medium. Assuming a frequency cutoff, our results are in agreement\nwith those recently obtained by Barton [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 32(1999)525].\n", "  A general fundamental relation connecting the correlation of Stokes and\nanti-Stokes modes to the quantum statistical behavior of vibration and pump\nmodes in Raman-active materials is derived. We show that under certain\nconditions this relation can be used to determine the equilibrium number\nvariance of phonons.Time and temperature ranges for which such conditions can\nbe satisfied are studied and found to be available in todays' experimental\nstandards. Furthermore, we examine the results in the presence of multi-mode\npump as well as for the coupling of pump to the many vibration modes and\ndiscuss their validity in these cases.\n", "  An initially isotropic medium, when subjected to either a magnetic field or a\ncoherent field, can induce anisotropy in the medium and can cause the\npolarization of a probe field to rotate. Therefore the rotation of probe\npolarization, due to magnetic field alone, can be controlled efficiently with\nthe use of a coherent control field. We demonstrate this enhancement of the\nmagneto-optical rotation (MOR) of a linearly polarized light, by doing detailed\ncalculations on a system with relevant transitions $j=0\\leftrightarrow\nj=1\\leftrightarrow j=0$.\n", "  The Dirac oscillator is an exactly soluble model recently introduced in the\ncontext of many particle models in relativistic quantum mechanics. The model\nhas been also considered as an interaction term for modelling quark confinement\nin quantum chromodynamics. These considerations should be enough for\ndemonstrating that the Dirac oscillator can be an excellent example in\nrelativistic quantum mechanics. In this paper we offer a solution to the\nproblem and discuss some of its properties. We also discuss a physical picture\nfor the Dirac oscillator's non-standard interaction, showing how it arises on\ndescribing the behaviour of a neutral particle carrying an anomalous magnetic\nmoment and moving inside an uniformly charged sphere.\n", "  Based on a closed form expression for the path integral of quantum transition\namplitudes, we suggest rigorous definitions of both, quantum instantons and\nquantum chaos. As an example we compute the quantum instanton of the double\nwell potential.\n", "  In order to extend the recently proposed Monte Carlo Hamiltonian to many-body\nsystems, we suggest to concept of a stochastic basis. We apply it to the chain\nof $N_s=9$ coupled anharmonic oscillators. We compute the spectrum of excited\nstates in a finite energy window and thermodynamical observables free energy,\naverage energy, entropy and specific heat in a finite temperature window.\nComparing the results of the Monte Carlo Hamiltonian with standard Lagrangian\nlattice calculations, we find good agreement. However, the Monte Carlo\nHamiltonian results show less fluctuations under variation of temperature.\n"]}
