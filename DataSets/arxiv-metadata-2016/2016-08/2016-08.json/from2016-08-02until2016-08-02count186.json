Then, the time operator of the\nLagrangian of the KdV equation has been transformed into fractional domain in\nterms of the left-Riemann-Liouville fractional differential operator. The\nvariational of the functional of this Lagrangian leads neatly to Euler-Lagrange\nequation. Via Agrawal's method, one can easily derive the time-fractional KdV\nequation from this Euler-Lagrange equation. Remarkably, the time-fractional\nterm in the resulting KdV equation is obtained in Riesz fractional derivative\nin a direct manner. As a second step, the derived time-fractional KdV equation\nis solved using He's variational-iteration method. The calculations are carried\nout using initial condition depends on the nonlinear and dispersion\ncoefficients of the KdV equation. We remark that more pronounced effects and\ndeeper insight into the formation and properties of the resulting solitary wave\nby additionally considering the fractional order derivative beside the\nnonlinearity and dispersion terms.\n", "  In Part I, we extend our analysis in [arXiv:0807.1107], and show that a\nmathematically conjectured geometric Langlands duality for complex surfaces in\n[1], and its generalizations -- which relate some cohomology of the moduli\nspace of certain (\"ramified\") G-instantons to the integrable representations of\nthe Langlands dual of certain affine (sub) G-algebras, where G is any compact\nLie group -- can be derived, purely physically, from the principle that the\nspacetime BPS spectra of string-dual M-theory compactifications ought to be\nequivalent.\n  In Part II, to the setup in Part I, we introduce Omega-deformation via\nfluxbranes and add half-BPS boundary defects via M9-branes, and show that the\ncelebrated AGT correspondence in [2, 3], and its generalizations -- which\nessentially relate, among other things, some equivariant cohomology of the\nmoduli space of certain (\"ramified\") G-instantons to the integrable\nrepresentations of the Langlands dual of certain affine W-algebras -- can\nlikewise be derived from the principle that the spacetime BPS spectra of\nstring-dual M-theory compactifications ought to be equivalent.\n  In Part III, we consider various limits of our setup in Part II, and connect\nour story to chiral fermions and integrable systems. Among other things, we\nderive the Nekrasov-Okounkov conjecture in [4] -- which relates the topological\nstring limit of the dual Nekrasov partition function for pure G to the\nintegrable representations of the Langlands dual of an affine G-algebra -- and\nalso demonstrate that the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit of the \"fully-ramified\"\nNekrasov instanton partition function for pure G is a simultaneous\neigenfunction of the quantum Toda Hamiltonians associated with the Langlands\ndual of an affine G-algebra. Via the case with matter, we also make contact\nwith Hitchin systems and the \"ramified\" geometric Langlands correspondence for\ncurves.\n", "  We present results on the longitudinal spin Seebeck effect (LSSE) shown by\nsemiconducting ferrimagnetic NiFe2O4/Pt films from room temperature down to 50K\nbase temperature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation\nof spin caloric effect in NiFe2O4 thin films. The temperature dependence of the\nconductivity has been studied in parallel to obtain information about the\norigin of the electric potentials detected at the Pt coverage of the\nferrimagnet in order to distinguish the LSSE from the anomalous Nernst effect.\nFurthermore, the dependence of the LSSE on temperature gradients as well as the\ninfluence of an external magnetic field direction is investigated.\n", "  We present neutral hydrogen observations for a sample of eight nearby,\nlate-type, edge-on galaxies. All of the galaxies have been well resolved in the\nradial direction, while six have also been well resolved in the vertical\ndirection. We find that each of the galaxies has approximately the same maximum\nsurface brightness temperature throughout its disc. We argue that\nself-absorption is the main cause of this phenomenon and that subsequent\ndecompositions will require a treatment of this.\n", "  We generalize our analysis in [arXiv:1301.1977], and show that a 5d and 6d\nAGT correspondence for SU(N) -- which essentially relates the relevant 5d and\n6d Nekrasov instanton partition functions to the integrable representations of\na q-deformed and elliptic affine W_N-algebra -- can be derived, purely\nphysically, from the principle that the spacetime BPS spectra of string-dual\nM-theory compactifications ought to be equivalent. Via an appropriate defect,\nwe also derive a \"fully-ramified\" version of the 5d and 6d AGT correspondence\nwhere integrable representations of a quantum and elliptic affine SU(N)-algebra\nat the critical level appear on the 2d side, and argue that the relevant\n\"fully-ramified\" 5d and 6d Nekrasov instanton partition functions are\nsimultaneous eigenfunctions of commuting operators which define relativistic\nand elliptized integrable systems. As an offshoot, we also obtain various\nmathematically novel and interesting relations involving the double loop\nalgebra of SU(N), elliptic Macdonald operators, equivariant elliptic genus of\ninstanton moduli space, and more.\n", "  The transverse Ising magnet Hamiltonian describing the Ising chain in a\ntransverse magnetic field is the archetypal example of a system that undergoes\na transition at a quantum critical point (QCP). The columbite CoNb$_2$O$_6$ is\nthe closest realization of the transverse Ising magnet found to date. At low\ntemperatures, neutron diffraction has observed a set of discrete collective\nspin modes near the QCP. We ask if there are low-lying spin excitations\ndistinct from these relatively high energy modes. Using the heat capacity, we\nshow that a significant band of gapless spin excitations exists. At the QCP,\ntheir spin entropy rises to a prominent peak that accounts for 30$\\%$ of the\ntotal spin degrees of freedom. In a narrow field interval below the QCP, the\ngapless excitations display a fermion-like, temperature-linear heat capacity\nbelow 1 K. These novel gapless modes are the main spin excitations\nparticipating in, and affected, by the quantum transition.\n", "  We present a simple stochastic quadrant model for calculating the transport\nand de- position of heavy particles in a fully developed turbulent boundary\nlayer based on the statistics of wall-normal fluid velocity fluctuations\nobtained from a fully developed channel flow. Individual particles are tracked\nthrough the boundary layer via their interactions with a succession of random\neddies found in each of the quadrants of the fluid Reynolds shear stress domain\nin a homogeneous Markov chain process. In this way we are able to account\ndirectly for the influence of ejection and sweeping events as others have done\nbut without resorting to the use of adjustable parameters. Deposition rate\npredictions for a wide range of heavy particles predicted by the model compare\nwell with benchmark experimental measurements. In addition deposition rates are\ncompared with those obtained from continuous random walk (CRW) models and\nLangevin equation based ejection and sweep models which noticeably give sig-\nnificantly lower deposition rates. Various statistics related to the particle\nnear wall behavior are also presented. Finally we consider the model\nlimitations in using the model to calculate deposition in more complex flows\nwhere the near wall turbulence may be significantly different.\n", "  We propose a combination of two mechanisms that can resolve the black hole\ninformation paradox. The first process is that the black hole shrinks by a\nfirst order transition, since we assume the entropy is discontinuous. The black\nhole disappears. The second type of processes conserves unitarity. We assume\nthat within the black hole micro-reversible quantum mechanical processes take\nplace. These are ordinary particle processes, e.g. the decay of an electron and\na positron into two photons.\n", "  Realizing topological insulators is of great current interest because of\ntheir remarkable properties and possible future applications. There are recent\nproposals, based on Floquet analyses, that one can generate topologically\nnontrivial insulators by periodically driving topologically trivial ones. Here\nwe address what happens if one follows the dynamics in such systems.\nSpecifically, we present an exact study of the time evolution of a\ngraphene-like system subjected to a circularly polarized electric field. We\nprove that, for infinite (translationally invariant) systems, the Chern number\nis conserved under unitary evolution. For systems with boundaries, on the other\nhand, we show that a properly defined topological invariant, the Bott index,\ncan change. Hence, it should be possible to experimentally prepare topological\nstates starting from non-topological ones. We show that the chirality of the\nedge current in such systems can be controlled by adjusting the filling.\n", "  The relativistic interacting quark-diquark model of baryons, recently\ndeveloped, is here extended to introduce a spin-isospin transition interaction\ninto the mass operator. The refined version of the model is used to calculate\nthe non strange baryon spectrum. The results are compared to the present\nexperimental data.\n", "  Constructing a well-posed variational principle is a non-trivial issue in\ngeneral relativity. For spacelike and timelike boundaries, one knows that the\naddition of the Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) counter-term will make the\nvariational principle well-defined. This result, however, does not directly\ngeneralize to null boundaries on which the 3-metric becomes degenerate. In this\nwork, we address the following question: What is the counter-term that may be\nadded on a null boundary to make the variational principle well-defined? We\npropose the boundary integral of $2 \\sqrt{-g} \\left( \\Theta+\\kappa \\right)$ as\nan appropriate counter-term for a null boundary. We also conduct a preliminary\nanalysis of the variations of the metric on the null boundary and conclude that\nisolating the degrees of freedom that may be fixed for a well-posed variational\nprinciple requires a deeper investigation.\n", "  We suggest a novel mechanism to induce the motion of a chiral material body\ntowards an optical source. Our solution is based on the interference between a\nchiral light beam and its reflection on an opaque mirror. Surprisingly, it is\ntheoretically shown that the electromagnetic response of the material may be\ntailored in such a way that independent of the specific body location with the\nrespect to the mirror, it is always pushed upstream against the photon flow\nassociated with the incoming wave. Moreover, it is proven that by controlling\nthe handedness of the incoming light it may be possible to harness the sign of\nthe optical force, switching from a pulling force to a pushing force.\n", "  We study the off-shell mixing and renormalization of flavor-diagonal\ndimension-5 T- and P-odd operators involving quarks, gluons, and photons,\nincluding quark electric dipole and chromo-electric dipole operators. We\npresent the renormalization matrix to one-loop in the $\\bar{\\rm MS}$ scheme. We\nalso provide a definition of the quark chromo-electric dipole operator in a\nregularization-independent momentum-subtraction scheme suitable for\nnon-perturbative lattice calculations and present the matching coefficients\nwith the $\\bar{\\rm MS}$ scheme to one-loop in perturbation theory, using both\nthe naive dimensional regularization and 't Hooft-Veltman prescriptions for\n$\\gamma_5$.\n", "  The evolution of the centre-of-mass wave-function for a mesoscopic particle\naccording to the Schr\\\"odinger-Newton equation can be approximated by a\nharmonic potential, if the wave-function is narrow compared to the size of the\nparticle. It was noticed by Colin et al. [Phys. Rev. A, 93, 062102 (2016)]\nthat, in the regime where self-gravitational effects are weak, intermediate and\nwider wave-functions may be approximated by a harmonic potential as well, but\nwith a width dependent coupling, leading to a time evolution that is determined\nonly by a differential equation for the width of a Gaussian wave-function as a\nsingle parameter. Such an approximation results in considerably less\ncomputational effort in order to predict the self-gravitational effects on the\nwave-function dynamics. Here, we provide an alternative approach to this kind\nof approximation, including a rigorous derivation of the equations of motion\nfor an initially Gaussian wave packet, under the assumption that its shape is\nconserved. Our result deviates to some degree from the result by Colin et al.,\nspecifically in the limit of wide wave-functions.\n", "  We find chimera states with respect to amplitude dynamics in a network of\nStuart-Landau oscillators. These partially coherent and partially incoherent\nspatio-temporal patterns appear due to the interplay of nonlocal network\ntopology and symmetry-breaking coupling. As the coupling range is increased,\nthe oscillations are quenched, amplitude chimeras disappear and the network\nenters a symmetry-breaking stationary state. This particular regime is a novel\npattern which we call chimera death. It is characterized by the coexistence of\nspatially coherent and incoherent inhomogeneous steady states and therefore\ncombines the features of chimera state and oscillation death. Additionally, we\nshow two different transition scenarios from amplitude chimera to chimera\ndeath. Moreover, for amplitude chimeras we uncover the mechanism of transition\ntowards in-phase synchronized regime and discuss the role of initial\nconditions.\n", "  Premixed flames propagating within small channels show complex combustion\nphenomena that differ from flame propagation at conventional scales. Available\nexperimental and numerical studies have documented stationary/non-stationary\nand/or asymmetric modes that depend on properties of the incoming reactant flow\nas well as channel geometry and wall temperatures. The present work seeks to\nilluminate mechanisms leading to symmetry-breaking and limit cycle behavior\nthat are fundamental to these combustion modes. Specifically, four cases of\nlean premixed methane/air combustion -- two equivalence ratios (0.53 and 0.7)\nand two channel widths (2 and 5mm) -- are investigated in a 2D configuration\nwith constant channel length and bulk inlet velocity, where numerical\nsimulations are performed using detailed chemistry. External wall heating is\nsimulated by imposing a linear temperature gradient as a boundary condition on\nboth walls. In the 2mm-channel, both equivalence ratios produce flames that\nstabilize with symmetric flame fronts after propagating upstream. In the\n5mm-channel, flame fronts start symmetric, although symmetry is broken almost\nimmediately after ignition. Further, 5mm channels produce instationary\ncombustion modes with dramatically different limit cycles: : in the leaner case\n({\\phi} = 0.53), the asymmetric flame front flops periodically, whereas in the\nricher case ({\\phi} = 0.7), flames with repetitive extinctions and ignitions\n(FREI) are observed. In order to provide insights into mechanisms responsible\nfor flame dynamics, reaction fronts and flame fronts are captured and\ndifferentiated. Results show that the loss of flame front symmetry originates\nin a region where negative stretch rates close to the flame cusp show large\ngradients/curvatures; thus, symmetry-breaking is attributed to a hydrodynamic\ninstability. Limit cycle behavior is [...]\n", "  We propose a simple model which possesses the chain fountain effect.\n", "  To explore new superconductors beyond the copper-based and iron-based systems\nis very important. The Ru element locates just below the Fe in the periodic\ntable and behaves like the Fe in many ways. One of the common thread to induce\nhigh temperature superconductivity is to introduce moderate correlation into\nthe system. In this paper, we report the significant enhancement of\nsuperconducting transition temperature from 3.84K to 5.77K by using a pressure\nonly of 1.74 GPa in LaRu2P2 which has an iso-structure of the iron-based 122\nsuperconductors. The ab-initio calculation shows that the superconductivity in\nLaRu2P2 at ambient pressure can be explained by the McMillan's theory with\nstrong electron-phonon coupling. However, it is difficult to interpret the\nsignificant enhancement of Tc versus pressure within this picture. Detailed\nanalysis of the pressure induced evolution of resistivity and upper critical\nfield Hc2(T) reveals that the increases of Tc with pressure may be accompanied\nby the involvement of extra electronic correlation effect. This suggests that\nthe Ru-based system has some commonality as the Fe-based superconductors.\n", "  Superconductivity in strongly correlated systems is a remarkable phenomenon\nthat attracts a huge interest. The study of this problem is relevant for\nmaterials as the high Tc oxides, pnictides and heavy fermions. In this work we\nstudy a realistic model that includes the relevant physics of superconductivity\nin the presence of strong Coulomb correlations. We consider a two-band model,\nsince most of these correlated systems have electrons from at least two\ndifferent atomic orbitals coexisting at their Fermi surface. The Coulomb\nrepulsion is taken into account through a local repulsive interaction. Pairing\nis considered among quasi- particles in neighbouring sites and we allow for\ndifferent symmetries of the order parameter. In order to deal with the strong\nlocal correlations, we use the well known slave boson approach that has proved\nvery successful for this problem. Here we are interested in obtaining the zero\ntemperature properties of the model, specifically its phase diagram and the\nexistence and nature of superconducting quantum critical points. We show that\nthese can arise by increasing the mixing between the two bands. Since this can\nbe controlled by external pressure or doping, our results have a direct\nrelation with experiments. We show that the superconductor-to-normal transition\ncan be either to a metal, a correlated metal or to an insulator. Also we\ncompare the relative stability of s and d-wave paired states for different\nregions of parameter space and investigate the BCS- BEC crossover in the\ntwo-band lattice model as function of the strength of the pairing interaction.\n", "  We study a two-loop induced radiative neutrino model at TeV scale with global\n$U(1)$ symmetry, in which we analyze dark matter and resonant leptogenesis. The\nmodel includes two kinds of dark matter candidates. We discuss what kind of\ndark matter can satisfy the observed relic density as well as the current\ndirect detection bound, and be simultaneously compatible with the leptogenesis.\nWe also discuss whether our resonant leptogenesis can be differentiated from\nthe other scenarios at TeV scale or not.\n", "  The combination of plasmonic nanoparticles and graphene enhances the\nresponsivity and spectral selectivity of graphene-based photodetectors.\nHowever, the small area of the metal-graphene junction, where the induced\nelectron-hole pairs separate, limits the photoactive region to sub-micron\nlength scales. Here, we couple graphene with a plasmonic grating and exploit\nthe resulting surface plasmon polaritons to deliver the collected photons to\nthe junction region of a metal-graphene-metal photodetector. This results into\na 400% enhancement of responsivity and a 1000% increase in photoactive length,\ncombined with tunable spectral selectivity. The interference between surface\nplasmon polaritons and the incident wave introduces new functionalities, such\nas light flux attraction or repulsion from the contact edges, enabling the\ntailored design of the photodetector's spectral response. This architecture can\nalso be used for surface plasmon bio-sensing with direct-electric- readout,\neliminating the need of complicated optics.\n", "  We propose and investigate a new type of optical waveguide made by an array\nof atoms without involving conventional Bragg scattering or total internal\nreflection. A finite chain of atoms collectively coupled through their\nintrinsic resonance supports a propagating mode with minimal radiative loss\nwhen the array spacing $a$ is around 0.6$\\lambda_0/2\\pi$ where $\\lambda_0$ is\nthe wavelength of the nearly resonant optical transition. We find that the\ntransportation is robust with respect to position fluctuation and remains\npossible when the atoms are placed on a circle. Our result paves the way to\nimplement the subwavelength transportation of light in integrated optical\ncircuits with cold atoms.\n", "  Observational manifestations of accelerated expansion of the universe, in\nparticular, recent data for Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations,\nfor the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and cosmic microwave background constraints are\ndescribed with different cosmological models. We compare the $\\Lambda$CDM, the\nmodels with generalized and modified Chaplygin gas and the model with quadratic\nequation of state. For these models we estimate optimal model parameters and\ntheir permissible errors with different approaches to calculation of sound\nhorizon scale $r_s(z_d)$. Among the considered models the best value of\n$\\chi^2$ is achieved for the model with quadratic equation of state, but it has\n2 additional parameters in comparison with the $\\Lambda$CDM and therefore is\nnot favored by the Akaike information criterion.\n", "  A brief survey of the author and collaborators' work in compressive sensing\napplications to continuous imaging models.\n", "  Subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) is a widely-used method to connect galaxies\nwith dark matter structures in numerical simulations. SHAM predictions agree\nremarkably well with observations, yet they still lack strong theoretical\nsupport. We examine the performance, implementation, and assumptions of SHAM\nusing the EAGLE project simulations. We find that $V_{\\rm relax}$, the highest\nvalue of the circular velocity attained by a subhalo while it satisfies a\nrelaxation criterion, is the subhalo property that correlates most strongly\nwith galaxy stellar mass ($M_{\\rm star}$). Using this parameter in SHAM, we\nretrieve the real-space clustering of EAGLE to within our statistical\nuncertainties on scales greater than $2$ Mpc for galaxies with\n$8.77<\\log_{10}(M_{\\rm star}[M_\\odot])<10.77$. Conversely, clustering is\noverestimated by $30\\%$ on scales below $2$ Mpc for galaxies with\n$8.77<\\log_{10}(M_{\\rm star}[M_\\odot])<9.77$ because SHAM slightly overpredicts\nthe fraction of satellites in massive haloes compared to EAGLE. The agreement\nis even better in redshift-space, where the clustering is recovered to within\nour statistical uncertainties for all masses and separations. Additionally, we\nanalyse the dependence of galaxy clustering on properties other than halo mass,\ni.e. the assembly bias. We demonstrate assembly bias alters the clustering in\nEAGLE by $20\\%$ and that $V_{\\rm relax}$ captures its effect to within $15\\%$.\nWe trace small differences in the clustering to the failure of SHAM as\ntypically implemented, i.e. the $M_{\\rm star}$ assigned to a subhalo does not\ndepend on i) its host halo mass, ii) whether it is a central or a satellite. In\nEAGLE we find that these assumptions are not completely satisfied.\n", "  In this article, we assume that the nonet scalar mesons below $1\\,\\rm{ GeV}$\nare the two-quark-tetraquark mixed states and study their masses and pole\nresidues using the QCD sum rules. In calculation, we take into account the\nvacuum condensates up to dimension 10 and the $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s)$\ncorrections to the perturbative terms in the operator product expansion. We\ndetermine the mixing angles, which indicate the two-quark components are much\nlarger than $50\\%$, then obtain the masses and pole residues of the nonet\nscalar mesons.\n", "  The glitch activity of young pulsars arises from the exchange of angular\nmomentum between the crust and the interior of the star. Recently, it was\ninferred that the moment of inertia of the crust of a neutron star is not\nsufficient to explain the observed glitches. Such estimates are presumed in the\nEinstein's general relativity in describing the hydrostatic equilibrium of\nneutron stars. The crust of the neutron star has a space-time curvature of 14\norders of magnitude larger than that probed in solar system tests. This makes\ngravity the weakest constrained physics input in the crust related processes.\nWe calculate the ratio of the crustal to the total moment of inertia of neutron\nstars in the scalar-tensor theory of gravity and the non-perturbative $f({\\cal\nR})={\\cal R}+ a {\\cal R}^2$ gravity. We find for the former that the crust to\ncore ratio of the moment of inertia does not change significantly from what is\ninferred in general relativity. For the latter we find that the ratio increases\nsignificantly from what is inferred in general relativity in the case of high\nmass objects. Our results suggest that the glitch activity of pulsars may be\nused to probe gravity models, although the gravity models explored in this work\nare not appropriate candidates.\n", "  We present x-ray resonant magnetic reflectivity (XRMR) as a very sensitive\ntool to detect proximity induced interface spin polarization in Pt/Fe,\nPt/Ni$_{33}$Fe$_{67}$, Pt/Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$ (permalloy), and Pt/Ni bilayers.\nWe demonstrate that a detailed analysis of the reflected x-ray intensity gives\ninsight in the spatial distribution of the spin polarization of a non-magnetic\nmetal across the interface to a ferromagnetic layer. The evaluation of the\nexperimental results with simulations based on optical data from ab initio\ncalculations provides the induced magnetic moment per Pt atom in the spin\npolarized volume adjacent to the ferromagnet. We find the largest spin\npolarization in Pt/Fe and a much smaller magnetic proximity effect in Pt/Ni.\nAdditional XRMR experiments with varying photon energy are in good agreement\nwith the theoretical predictions for the energy dependence of the magnetooptic\nparameters and allow identifying the optical dispersion $\\delta$ and absorption\n$\\beta$ across the Pt L3-absorption edge.\n", "  We measure graphene coplanar waveguides from direct current (DC) to 13.5GHz\nand show that the apparent resistance (in the presence of parasitic impedances)\nhas an quadratic frequency dependence, but the intrinsic conductivity (without\nthe influence of parasitic impedances) is frequency-independent. Consequently,\nin our devices the real part of the complex alternating current conductivity is\nthe same as the DC value and the imaginary part~0. The graphene channel is\nmodelled as a parallel resistive-capacitive network with a frequency dependence\nidentical to that of the Drude conductivity with momentum relaxation\ntime~2.1ps, highlighting the influence of alternating current (AC) electron\ntransport on the electromagnetic properties of graphene. This can lead to\noptimized design of high-speed analogue field-effect transistors, mixers,\nfrequency doublers, low-noise amplifiers and radiation detectors.\n", "  Using a viscosity-based survival scale for geometrical perturbations formed\nin the early stages of relativistic heavy-ion collisions, we model the radial\nflow velocity during freeze-out. Subsequently, we employ the Cooper-Frye\nfreeze-out prescription, with first-order viscous corrections to the\ndistribution function, to obtain the transverse momentum distribution of\nparticle yields and flow harmonics. For initial eccentricities, we use the\nresults of Monte Carlo Glauber model. We fix the blast-wave model parameters by\nfitting the transverse momentum spectra of identified particles at the Large\nHadron Collider (LHC) and demonstrate that this leads to a fairly good\nagreement with transverse momentum distribution of elliptic and triangular flow\nfor various centralities. Within this viscous blast-wave model, we estimate the\nshear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\\eta/s\\simeq 0.24$ at the LHC.\n", "  As one approaches the continuum limit, $QCD$ systems, investigated via\nnumerical simulations, remain trapped in sectors of field space with fixed\ntopological charge. As a consequence the numerical studies of physical\nquantities may give biased results. The same is true in the case of two\ndimensional $CP^{N-1}$ models. In this paper we show that metadynamics, when\nused to simulate $CP^{N-1}$, allows to address efficiently this problem. By\nstudying $CP^{20}$ we show that we are able to reconstruct the free energy of\nthe topological charge $F(Q)$ and compute the topological susceptibility as a\nfunction of the coupling and of the volume. This is a very important physical\nquantity in studies of the dynamics of the $\\theta$ vacuum and of the axion.\nThis method can in principle be extended to $QCD$ applications.\n", "  Using trapped atomic ions we demonstrate a tailored and versatile effective\nspin-system suitable for quantum simulations and universal quantum computation.\nBy simply applying microwave pulses, selected spins can be decoupled from the\nremaining system and thus can serve as a quantum memory, while simultaneously,\nother coupled spins perform conditional quantum dynamics. Also, microwave\npulses can change the sign of spin-spin couplings, as well as their effective\nstrength, even during the course of a quantum algorithm. Taking advantage of\nthe simultaneous long-range coupling between three spins a coherent quantum\nFourier transform -- an essential building block for many quantum algorithms --\nis efficiently realized. This approach, which is based on microwave-driven\ntrapped ions and is complementary to laser-based methods, opens a new route to\novercoming technical and physical challenges in the quest for a quantum\nsimulator and a quantum computer.\n", "  We calculate the squeezed back-to-back correlation (BBC) functions of $\\phi\n\\phi$ and $K^+K^-$ for heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, using\n($2+1$)-dimensional hydrodynamics with fluctuating initial conditions. The BBC\nfunctions averaged over event-by-event calculations for many events for the\nhydrodynamic sources are smoothed as a function of the particle momentum. For\nheavy-ion collisions of Au+Au at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, the BBC functions are\nlarger than those for collisions of Pb+Pb at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV. The BBC\nof $\\phi\\phi$ may possibly be observed in peripheral collisions at the RHIC and\nLHC energies. It is large for the smaller sources of Cu+Cu collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV.\n", "  This review gives a pedagogical introduction to the eigenstate thermalization\nhypothesis (ETH), its basis, and its implications to statistical mechanics and\nthermodynamics. In the first part, ETH is introduced as a natural extension of\nideas from quantum chaos and random matrix theory (RMT). To this end, we\npresent a brief overview of classical and quantum chaos, as well as RMT and\nsome of its most important predictions. The latter include the statistics of\nenergy levels, eigenstate components, and matrix elements of observables.\nBuilding on these, we introduce the ETH and show that it allows one to describe\nthermalization in isolated chaotic systems without invoking the notion of an\nexternal bath. We examine numerical evidence of eigenstate thermalization from\nstudies of many-body lattice systems. We also introduce the concept of a quench\nas a means of taking isolated systems out of equilibrium, and discuss results\nof numerical experiments on quantum quenches. The second part of the review\nexplores the implications of quantum chaos and ETH to thermodynamics. Basic\nthermodynamic relations are derived, including the second law of\nthermodynamics, the fundamental thermodynamic relation, fluctuation theorems,\nand the Einstein and Onsager relations. In particular, it is shown that quantum\nchaos allows one to prove these relations for individual Hamiltonian\neigenstates and thus extend them to arbitrary stationary statistical ensembles.\nWe then show how one can use these relations to obtain nontrivial universal\nenergy distributions in continuously driven systems. At the end of the review,\nwe briefly discuss the relaxation dynamics and description after relaxation of\nintegrable quantum systems, for which ETH is violated. We introduce the concept\nof the generalized Gibbs ensemble, and discuss its connection with ideas of\nprethermalization in weakly interacting systems.\n", "  The Schr\\\"odinger-Newton equation has gained attention in the recent past as\na nonlinear modification of the Schr\\\"odinger equation due to a gravitational\nself-interaction. Such a modification is expected from a fundamentally\nsemi-classical theory of gravity, and can therefore be considered a test case\nfor the necessity of the quantisation of the gravitational field. Here we\nprovide a thorough study of the effects of the Schr\\\"odinger-Newton equation\nfor a micron-sized sphere trapped in a harmonic oscillator potential. We\ndiscuss both the effect on the energy eigenstates and the dynamical behaviour\nof squeezed states, covering the experimentally relevant parameter regimes.\n", "  The nucleation mechanisms during solution deposition of organic semiconductor\nthin films determine the grain morphology and may influence the crystalline\npacking in some cases. Here, in-situ optical spectromicroscopy in reflection\nmode is used to study the growth mechanisms and thermal stability of\n6,13-bis(trisopropylsilylethynyl)-pentacene thin films. The results show that\nthe films form in a supersaturated state before transforming to a solid film.\nMolecular aggregates corresponding to subcritical nuclei in the crystallization\nprocess are inferred from optical spectroscopy measurements of the\nsupersaturated region. Strain-free solid films exhibit a temperature-dependent\nblue shift of optical absorption peaks due to a continuous thermally driven\nchange of the crystalline packing. As crystalline films are cooled to ambient\ntemperature they become strained although cracking of thicker films is\nobserved, which allows the strain to partially relax. Below a critical\nthickness, cracking is not observed and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction\nmeasurements confirm that the thinnest films are constrained to the lattice\nconstants corresponding to the temperature at which they were deposited.\nOptical spectroscopy results show that the transition temperature between Form\nI (room temperature phase) and Form II (high temperature phase) depends on the\nfilm thickness, and that Form I can also be strain-stabilized up to\n135$^\\circ$C.\n", "  We obtain a class of regular black hole solutions in four-dimensional $f(R)$\ngravity, $R$ being the curvature scalar, coupled to a nonlinear electromagnetic\nsource. The metric formalism is used and static spherically symmetric\nspacetimes are assumed. The resulting $f(R)$ and nonlinear electrodynamics\nfunctions are characterized by a one-parameter family of solutions which are\ngeneralizations of known regular black holes in general relativity coupled to\nnonlinear electrodynamics. The related regular black holes of general\nrelativity are recovered when the free parameter vanishes, in which case one\nhas $f(R)\\propto R$. We analyze the regularity of the solutions and also show\nthat there are particular solutions that violate only the strong energy\ncondition\n", "  We investigated structural, magnetic and electrical properties of sputter\ndeposited Mn-Fe-Ga compounds. The crystallinity of the Mn-Fe-Ga thin films was\nconfirmed using x-ray diffraction. X-ray reflection and atomic force microscopy\nmeasurements were utilized to investigate the surface properties, roughness,\nthickness and density of the deposited Mn-Fe-Ga. Depending on the\nstoichiometry, as well as the used substrates (SrTiO3 (001) and MgO (001)) or\nbuffer layer (TiN) the Mn-Fe-Ga crystallizes in the cubic or the tetragonally\ndistorted phase. Anomalous Hall effect and alternating gradient magnetometry\nmeasurements confirmed strong perpendicular magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Low\nsaturation magnetization and hard magnetic behavior was reached by tuning the\ncomposition. Temperature dependent anomalous Hall effect measurements in a\nclosed cycle He-cryostat showed a slight increase in coercivity with decreasing\ntemperature (300K to 2K). TiN buffered Mn2.7Fe0.3Ga revealed sharper switching\nof the magnetization compared to the unbuffered layers.\n", "  We uncover the fine structure of a silicon vacancy in isotopically purified\nsilicon carbide (4H-$^{28}$SiC) and find extra terms in the spin Hamiltonian,\noriginated from the trigonal pyramidal symmetry of this spin-3/2 color center.\nThese terms give rise to additional spin transitions, which are otherwise\nforbidden, and lead to a level anticrossing in an external magnetic field. We\nobserve a sharp variation of the photoluminescence intensity in the vicinity of\nthis level anticrossing, which can be used for a purely all-optical sensing of\nthe magnetic field. We achieve dc magnetic field sensitivity of 87 nT\nHz$^{-1/2}$ within a volume of $3 \\times 10^{-7}$ mm$^{3}$ at room temperature\nand demonstrate that this contactless method is robust at high temperatures up\nto at least 500 K. As our approach does not require application of\nradiofrequency fields, it is scalable to much larger volumes. For an optimized\nlight-trapping waveguide of 3 mm$^{3}$ the projection noise limit is below 100\nfT Hz$^{-1/2}$.\n", "  Majorization uncertainty relations are derived for arbitrary quantum\noperations acting on a finite-dimensional space. The basic idea is to consider\nsubmatrices of block matrices comprised of the corresponding Kraus operators.\nThis is an extension of the previous formulation, which deals with submatrices\nof a unitary matrix relating orthogonal bases in which measurements are\nperformed. Two classes of majorization relations are considered: one related to\ntensor product of probability vectors and another one related to their direct\nsum. We explicitly discuss an example of a pair of one-qubit operations, each\nof them represented by two Kraus operators. In the particular case of quantum\nmaps describing orthogonal measurements the presented formulation reduces to\nearlier results derived for measurements in orthogonal bases. The presented\napproach allows us also to bound the entropy characterizing results of a single\ngeneralized measurement.\n", "  We report the structural transformation of the low-lying spectral modes,\nespecially the Kohn mode, from radial to circular topology as harmonic\nconfining potential is modified to a toroidal one, and this corresponds to a\ntransition from simply to multiply connected geometry. For this we employ the\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory to examine the evolution of low energy\nquasiparticles. We, then, use the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory with the Popov\napproximation to demonstrate the two striking features of quantum and thermal\nfluctuations. At $T=0$, the non-condensate density due to interaction induced\nquantum fluctuations increases with the transformation from pancake to toroidal\ngeometry. The other feature is, there is a marked change in the density profile\nof the non-condensate density at finite temperatures with the modification of\ntrapping potential. In particular, the condensate and non-condensate density\ndistributions have overlapping maxima in the toroidal condensate, which is in\nstark contrast to the case of pancake geometry. The genesis of this difference\nlies in the nature of the thermal fluctuations.\n", "  We construct the explicit solution of the initial value problem for sequences\ngenerated by the general Somos-6 recurrence relation, in terms of the Kleinian\nsigma-function of genus two. For each sequence there is an associated genus two\ncurve $X$, such that iteration of the recurrence corresponds to translation by\na fixed vector in the Jacobian of $X$. The construction is based on a Lax pair\nwith a spectral curve $S$ of genus four admitting an involution $\\sigma$ with\ntwo fixed points, and the Jacobian of $X$ arises as the Prym variety\nPrym$(S,\\sigma)$.\n", "  We report the revised crystal structure, static and dynamic magnetic\nproperties of quasi-two dimensional honeycomb-lattice silver delafossite\nAg3Co2SbO6. The magnetic susceptibility and specific heat data are consistent\nwith the onset of antiferromagnetic long range order at low temperatures with\nN\\'eel temperature TN ~ 21.2 K. In addition, the magnetization curves revealed\na field-induced (spin-flop type) transition below TN in moderate magnetic\nfields. The GGA+U calculations show the importance of the orbital degrees of\nfreedom, which maintain a hierarchy of exchange interaction in the system. The\nstrongest antiferromagnetic exchange coupling was found in the shortest Co-Co\npairs and is due to direct and superexchange interactions between the\nhalf-filled xz+yz orbitals pointing directly to each other. The other four out\nof six nearest neighbor exchanges within the cobalt hexagon are suppressed,\nsince for these bonds active half-filled orbitals turned out to be parallel and\ndo not overlap. The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra reveal a Gaussian\nshape line attributed to Co2+ ion in octahedral coordination with average\neffective g-factor g=2.3+/-0.1 at room temperature and shows strong divergence\nof ESR parameters below 120 K, which imply an extended region of short-range\ncorrelations. Based on the results of magnetic and thermodynamic studies in\napplied fields, we propose the magnetic phase diagram for the new\nhoneycomb-lattice delafossite.\n", "  A new notion of stochastic transformation is proposed and applied to the\nstudy of both weak and strong symmetries of stochastic differential equations\n(SDEs). The correspondence between an algebra of weak symmetries for a given\nSDE and an algebra of strong symmetries for a modified SDE is proved under\nsuitable regularity assumptions. This general approach is applied to a\nstochastic version of a two dimensional symmetric ordinary differential\nequation and to the case of two dimensional Brownian motion.\n", "  We discuss the implications of the significant excesses in the diphoton final\nstate observed by the LHC experiments ATLAS and CMS around a diphoton invariant\nmass of 750 GeV. The interpretation of the excess as a spin-zero s-channel\nresonance implies model-independent lower bounds on both its branching ratio\nand its coupling to photons, which stringently constrain dynamical models. We\nconsider both the case where the excess is described by a narrow and a broad\nresonance. We also obtain model-independent constraints on the allowed\ncouplings and branching fractions to final states other than diphotons, by\nincluding the interplay with 8 TeV searches. These results can guide attempts\nto construct viable dynamical models of the resonance. Turning to specific\nmodels, our findings suggest that the anomaly cannot be accounted for by the\npresence of only an additional singlet or doublet spin-zero field and the\nStandard Model degrees of freedom; this includes all two-Higgs-doublet models.\nLikewise, heavy scalars in the MSSM cannot explain the excess if stability of\nthe electroweak vacuum is required, at least in a leading-order analysis. If we\nassume that the resonance is broad we find that it is challenging to find a\nweakly coupled explanation. However, we provide an existence proof in the form\nof a model with vectorlike quarks with large electric charge that is\nperturbative up to the 100 TeV scale. For the narrow-resonance case a similar\nmodel can be perturbative up to high scales also with smaller charges. We also\nfind that, in their simplest form, dilaton models cannot explain the size of\nthe excess. Some implications for flavor physics are briefly discussed.\n", "  A weakly coupled system of two crossed graphene nanoribbons exhibits direct\ntunneling due to the overlap of the wavefunctions of both ribbons. We apply the\nBardeen transfer Hamiltonian formalism, using atomistic band structure\ncalculations to account for the effect of the atomic structure on the tunneling\nprocess. The strong quantum-size confinement of the nanoribbons is mirrored by\nthe one-dimensional character of the electronic structure, resulting in\nproperties that differ significantly from the case of inter-layer tunneling,\nwhere tunneling occurs between bulk two-dimensional graphene sheets. The\ncurrent-voltage characteristics of the inter-ribbon tunneling structures\nexhibit resonance, as well as stepwise increases in current. Both features are\ncaused by the energetic alignment of one-dimensional peaks in the\ndensity-of-states of the ribbons. Resonant tunneling occurs if the sign of the\ncurvature of the coupled energy bands is equal, whereas a step-like increase of\nthe current occurs if the signs are opposite. Changing the doping modulates the\nonset- voltage of the effects as well as their magnitude. Doping through\nelectrostatic gating makes these structures promising for application towards\nsteep slope switching devices. Using the atomistic Bardeen transfer Hamiltonian\nmethod, inter-ribbon tunneling can be studied for the whole range of\ntwo-dimensional materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides. The\neffects of resonance and of step-like increases of the current, observed in\ngraphene ribbons, are also expected in ribbons made from these alternative\ntwo-dimensional materials, because these effects are manifestations of the\none-dimensional character of the density-of-states.\n", "  We report an on-chip integrated metal-graphene-silicon plasmonic Schottky\nphotodetector with 85mA/W responsivity at 1.55 um and 7% internal quantum\nefficiency. This is one order of magnitude higher than metal-silicon Schottky\nphotodetectors operated in the same conditions. At a reverse bias of 3V, we\nachieve avalanche multiplication, with 0.37A/W responsivity and avalanche\nphotogain~2. This paves the way to graphene integrated silicon photonics.\n", "  In this work we obtain bounds on the topological Abelian string-vortex and on\nthe string-cigar, by using a new measure of configurational complexity, known\nas configurational entropy. In this way, the information-theoretical measure of\nsix-dimensional braneworlds scenarios are capable to probe situations where the\nparameters responsible for the brane thickness are arbitrary. The so-called\nconfigurational entropy (CE) selects the best value of the parameter in the\nmodel. This is accomplished by minimizing the CE, namely, by selecting the most\nappropriate parameters in the model that correspond to the most organized\nsystem, based upon the Shannon information theory. This information-theoretical\nmeasure of complexity provides a complementary perspective to situations where\nstrictly energy-based arguments are inconclusive. We show that the higher the\nenergy the higher the CE, what shows an important correlation between the\nenergy of the a localized field configuration and its associated entropic\nmeasure.\n", "  We study the vacuum stability and perturbativity conditions in the minimal\ntype-II seesaw model. These conditions give characteristic constraints to model\nparameters. In the model, there is a $SU(2)_L$ triplet scalar field, which\ncould cause a large Higgs mass correction. From the naturalness point of view,\nheavy Higgs masses should be lower than $350\\,{\\rm GeV}$, which can be testable\nby the LHC Run-II results. Due to effects of the triplet scalar field,\nbranching ratios of the Higgs decay ($h\\to \\gamma \\gamma, Z\\gamma$) deviate\nfrom the standard model, and large parameter region is excluded by the recent\nATLAS and CMS combined analysis of $h\\to \\gamma \\gamma$. Our result of the\nsignal strength for $h\\to \\gamma \\gamma$ is $R_{\\gamma \\gamma} \\lesssim 1.1$,\nbut its deviation is too small to observe at the LHC experiment.\n", "  Divisibility of dynamical maps turns out to be a fundamental notion in\ncharacterising Markovianity of quantum evolution, although the decision problem\nfor divisibility itself is computationally intractable. In this work, we\npropose the operational characterisation of divisibility of dynamical maps by\nexploiting distinguishability of quantum channels. We prove that\ndistinguishability for any pair of quantum channels does not increase under\ndivisible maps, and then, in terms of channel distinguishability with\nentanglement between system and $k$-dimensional ancillas, provide the\noperational characterization for the full hierarchy of the so-called\n$k$-divisiblity $(k=1,2,\\ldots)$. Finally, from the fact that min-entropy\ncorresponds to the information-theoretic measure of distinguishability, the\nentropic characterisation to divisible maps is also provided.\n", "  A network picture has been applied to various physical and biological systems\nto understand their governing mechanisms intuitively. Utilizing discretization\nschemes, both electrical and optical materials can also be interpreted as\nabstract 'graph' networks composed of couplings (edges) between local elements\n(vertices), which define the correlation between material structures and wave\nflows. Nonetheless, the fertile structural degrees of freedom in graph theory\nhave not been fully exploited in physics owing to the suppressed long-range\ninteraction between far-off elements. Here, by exploiting the mathematical\nsimilarity between Hamiltonians in different dimensions, we propose the design\nof reduced-dimensional optical structures that perfectly preserve the level\nstatistics of disordered graph networks with significant long-range coupling.\nWe show that the disorder-induced removal of the level degeneracy in\nhigh-degree networks allows their isospectral projection to one-dimensional\nstructures without any disconnection. This inter-dimensional isospectrality\nbetween high- and low-degree graph-like structures enables the ultimate\nsimplification of broadband multilevel devices, from three- to one-dimensional\nstructures.\n", "  We examine the electronic heat transport phenomena in nanoscale junctions\ncomposed of organic molecules coupled to two metallic reservoirs of different\ntemperatures. The electronic heat flux and its dynamical noise properties are\ncalculated within the scattering (Landauer) formalism with the transmission\nprobability determined by using non-equilibrium Green's functions (NEGF\ntechnique). The method based on Taylor series expansion is used to determine\nnonlinear corrections to the electronic heat flux and its noise power spectral\ndensity with up to the second order terms with respect to the temperature\ndifference. Our results show only limited applicability of ballistic Fourier's\nlaw and fluctuation-dissipation theorem to heat transport in molecular systems.\nWe derived and tested numerically several signal-signal, noise-signal, and\nnoise-noise relations applicable to nanoscale heat flow carried by electrons at\nstrongly non-equilibrium conditions (similar formulas are expected for phonons\nand photons). Importantly, the special treatment proposed by us may be extended\nto higher order terms in order to address a variety of problems related to\nnonlinear thermal and electro-thermal effects which may occur at nanoscale.\n", "  The recent progress in integrated quantum optics has set the stage for the\ndevelopment of an integrated platform for quantum information processing with\nphotons, with potential applications in quantum simulation. Among the different\nmaterial platforms being investigated, direct-bandgap semiconductors and\nparticularly gallium arsenide (GaAs) offer the widest range of functionalities,\nincluding single- and entangled-photon generation by radiative recombination,\nlow-loss routing, electro-optic modulation and single-photon detection. This\npaper reviews the recent progress in the development of the key building blocks\nfor GaAs quantum photonics and the perspectives for their full integration in a\nfully-functional and densely integrated quantum photonic circuit.\n", "  We announce the discovery of the Crater 2 dwarf galaxy, identified in imaging\ndata of the VST ATLAS survey. Given its half-light radius of ~1100 pc, Crater 2\nis the fourth largest dwarf in the Milky Way, surpassed only by the LMC, SMC\nand the Sgr dwarf. With a total luminosity of $M_V\\approx-8$, this satellite\ngalaxy is also one of the lowest surface brightness dwarfs. Falling under the\nnominal detection boundary of 30 mag arcsec$^{-2}$, it compares in nebulosity\nto the recently discovered Tuc 2 and Tuc IV and UMa II. Crater 2 is located\n~120 kpc from the Sun and appears to be aligned in 3-D with the enigmatic\nglobular cluster Crater, the pair of ultra-faint dwarfs Leo IV and Leo V and\nthe classical dwarf Leo II. We argue that such arrangement is probably not\naccidental and, in fact, can be viewed as the evidence for the accretion of the\nCrater-Leo group.\n", "  We study photonic band gap formation in two-dimensional high refractive index\ndisordered materials where the dielectric structure is derived from packing\ndisks in real and reciprocal space. Numerical calculations of the photonic\ndensity of states demonstrate the presence of a band gap for all polarizations\nin both cases. We find that the band gap width is controlled by the increase in\npositional correlation inducing short-range order and hyperuniformity\nconcurrently. Our findings suggest that the optimization of short-range order,\nin particular the tailoring of Bragg scattering at the isotropic Brillouin\nzone, are of key importance for designing disordered PBG materials.\n", "  Isotropic and anisotropic magnetic behavior of the frustrated spin chain\ncompound $\\beta$-TeVO$_4$ is reported. Three magnetic transitions observed in\nzero magnetic field are tracked in fields applied along different\ncrystallographic directions using magnetization, heat capacity, and\nmagnetostriction measurements. Qualitatively different temperature-field\ndiagrams are obtained below 10 T for the field applied along $a$ or $b$ and\nalong $c$, respectively. In contrast, a nearly isotropic high-field phase\nemerges above 18 T and persists up to the saturation that occurs around 22.5 T.\nUpon cooling in low fields, the transitions at $T_{\\rm N1}$ and $T_{\\rm N2}$\ntoward the spin-density-wave and stripe phases are of the second order, whereas\nthe transition at $T_{\\rm N3}$ toward the helical state is of the first order\nand entails a lattice component. Our microscopic analysis identifies frustrated\n$J_1-J_2$ spin chains with a sizable antiferromagnetic interchain coupling in\nthe $bc$ plane and ferromagnetic couplings along the $a$ direction. The\ncompetition between these ferromagnetic interchain couplings and the helical\norder within the chain underlies the incommensurate order along the\n$a$-direction, as observed experimentally. Although a helical state is\ntriggered by the competition between $J_1$ and $J_2$ within the chain, the\nplane of the helix is not uniquely defined because of competing magnetic\nanisotropies. Using high-resolution synchrotron diffraction and $^{125}$Te\nnuclear magnetic resonance, we also demonstrate that the crystal structure of\n$\\beta$-TeVO$_4$ does not change down to 10 K, and the orbital state of\nV$^{4+}$ is preserved.\n", "  Recently, a general method for calculating conserved charges for (black hole)\nsolutions to generally covariant gravitational theories, in any dimensions and\nwith arbitrary asymptotic behaviors has been introduced. Equipped with this\nmethod, which can be dubbed as \"solution phase space method,\" we calculate mass\nand angular momentum for the Kerr-dS black holes. Furthermore, for any choice\nof horizons, associated entropy and the first law of thermodynamics are\nderived. Interestingly, according to insensitivity of the analysis to the\nchosen cosmological constant, the analysis unifies the thermodynamics of\nrotating stationary black holes in 4 (and other) dimensions with either AdS,\nflat or dS asymptotics. We extend the analysis to include electric charge, i.e.\nto the Kerr-Newman-dS black holes.\n", "  There is growing physical and mathematical interest in the hydrodynamics of\ndissipationless/dispersive media. Since G.~B.~Whitham's seminal publication\nfifty years ago that ushered in the mathematical study of dispersive\nhydrodynamics, there has been a significant body of work in this area. However,\nthere has been no comprehensive survey of the field of dispersive\nhydrodynamics. Utilizing Whitham's averaging theory as the primary mathematical\ntool, we review the rich mathematical developments over the past fifty years\nwith an emphasis on physical applications. The fundamental, large scale,\ncoherent excitation in dispersive hydrodynamic systems is an expanding,\noscillatory dispersive shock wave or DSW. Both the macroscopic and microscopic\nproperties of DSWs are analyzed in detail within the context of the universal,\nintegrable, and foundational models for uni-directional (Korteweg-de Vries\nequation) and bi-directional (Nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation) dispersive\nhydrodynamics. A DSW fitting procedure that does not rely upon integrable\nstructure yet reveals important macroscopic DSW properties is described. DSW\ntheory is then applied to a number of physical applications: superfluids,\nnonlinear optics, geophysics, and fluid dynamics. Finally, we survey some of\nthe more recent developments including non-classical DSWs, DSW interactions,\nDSWs in perturbed and inhomogeneous environments, and two-dimensional, oblique\nDSWs.\n", "  We have recently developed a simulation approach to calculate the equilibrium\nphase diagram of particle-based microphase formers. Here, this approach is used\nto calculate the phase behavior of the square-well linear model for different\nstrengths and ranges of the linear long-range repulsive component. The results\nare compared with various theoretical predictions for microphase formation. The\nanalysis further allows us to better understand the mechanism for microphase\nformation in colloidal suspensions.\n", "  It is known that each single typical pure state in an energy shell of a large\nisolated quantum system well represents a thermal equilibrium state of the\nsystem. We show that such typicality holds also for nonequilibrium steady\nstates (NESS's). We consider a small quantum system coupled to multiple\ninfinite reservoirs. In the long run, the total system reaches a unique NESS.\nWe identify a large Hilbert space from which pure states of the system are to\nbe sampled randomly and show that the typical pure states well describe the\nNESS. We also point out that the irreversible relaxation to the unique NESS is\nimportant to the typicality of the pure NESS's.\n", "  A striking prediction in topological insulators is the appearance of the\nquantized Hall resistance when the surface states are magnetized. The surface\nDirac states become gapped everywhere on the surface, but chiral edge states\nremain on the edges. In an applied current, the edge states produce a quantized\nHall resistance that equals the Chern number C = +1 or -1 (in natural units),\neven in zero magnetic field. This quantum anomalous Hall effect was observed by\nChang et al. With reversal of the magnetic field, the system is trapped in a\nmetastable state because of magnetic anisotropy. Here we investigate how the\nsystem escapes the metastable state at low temperatures (10-200 mK). When the\ndissipation (measured by the longitudinal resistance) is ultralow, we find that\nthe system escapes by making a few, very rapid transitions, as detected by\nlarge jumps in the Hall and longitudinal resistances. Using the field at which\nthe initial jump occurs to estimate the escape rate, we find that raising the\ntemperature strongly suppresses the rate. From a detailed map of the resistance\nvs. gate voltage and temperature, we show that dissipation strongly affects the\nescape rate. We compare the observations with dissipative quantum tunneling\npredictions. In the ultralow dissipation regime, there exist two temperature\nscales T1 = 70 mK and T2 = 145 mK between which jumps can be observed. The\njumps display a spatial correlation that extends over a large fraction of the\nsample.\n", "  Photonic crystals provide an extremely powerful toolset for manipulation of\noptical dispersion and density of states, and have thus been employed for\napplications from photon generation to quantum sensing with NVs and atoms. The\nunique control afforded by these media make them a beautiful, if unexplored,\nplayground for strong coupling quantum electrodynamics, where a single, highly\nnonlinear emitter hybridizes with the band structure of the crystal. In this\nwork we demonstrate that such hybridization can create localized cavity modes\nthat live within the photonic band-gap, whose localization and spectral\nproperties we explore in detail. We then demonstrate that the coloured vacuum\nof the photonic crystal can be employed for efficient dissipative state\npreparation. This work opens exciting prospects for engineering long-range spin\nmodels in the circuit QED architecture, as well as new opportunities for\ndissipative quantum state engineering.\n", "  Using derivative expansion applied to the Wigner transform of the two - point\nGreen function we analyse the anomalous quantum Hall effect (AQHE), and the\nchiral magnetic effect (CME). The corresponding currents are proportional to\nthe momentum space topological invariants. We reproduce the conventional\nexpression for the Hall conductivity in $2+1$ D. In $3+1$ D our analysis allows\nto explain systematically the AQHE in topological insulators and Weyl\nsemimetals. At the same time using this method it may be proved, that the\nequilibrium CME is absent in the wide class of solids, as well as in the\nproperly regularized relativistic quantum field theory.\n", "  We generalize the differential representation of the operators of the\nGalilean algebras to include fractional derivatives. As a result a whole new\nclass of scale invariant Galilean algebras are obtained. The first member of\nthis class has dynamical index $z=2$ similar to the Schr\\\"odinger algebra. The\nsecond member of the class has dynamical index $z=3/2$, which happens to be the\ndynamical index Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation.\n", "  The dense, cold regions where high-mass stars form are poorly characterised,\nyet they represent an ideal opportunity to learn more about the initial\nconditions of high-mass star formation (HMSF), since high-mass starless cores\n(HMSCs) lack the violent feedback seen at later evolutionary stages.\n  We present continuum maps obtained from the Submillimeter Array (SMA)\ninterferometry at 1.1 mm for four infrared dark clouds (IRDCs, G28.34S, IRDC\n18530, IRDC 18306, and IRDC 18308). We also present 1 mm/3 mm line surveys\nusing IRAM 30 m single-dish observations.\n  Our results are: (1) At a spatial resolution of 10^4 AU, the 1.1 mm SMA\nobservations resolve each source into several fragments. The mass of each\nfragment is on average >10 Msun, which exceeds the predicted thermal Jeans mass\nof the whole clump by a factor of up to 30, indicating that thermal pressure\ndoes not dominate the fragmentation process. Our measured velocity dispersions\nin the 30 m lines imply that non-thermal motions provides the extra support\nagainst gravity in the fragments. (2) Both non-detection of high-J transitions\nand the hyperfine multiplet fit of N2H+(1-0), C2H(1-0), HCN(1-0), and\nH13CN(1-0) indicate that our sources are cold and young. However, obvious\ndetection of SiO and the asymmetric line profile of HCO+(1-0) in G28.34S\nindicate a potential protostellar object and probable infall motion. (3) With a\nlarge number of N-bearing species, the existence of carbon rings and molecular\nions, and the anti-correlated spatial distributions between N2H+/NH2D and CO,\nour large-scale high-mass clumps exhibit similar chemical features as\nsmall-scale low-mass prestellar objects. This study of a small sample of IRDCs\nillustrates that thermal Jeans instability alone cannot explain the\nfragmentation of the clump into cold (~15 K), dense (>10^5 cm-3) cores and that\nthese IRDCs are not completely quiescent.\n", "  We provide an effective description of a particle-hole symmetric state of\nelectrons in a half-filled Landau level, starting from the traditional approach\npioneered by Halperin, Lee and Read. Specifically, we study a system consisting\nof alternating quasi-one-dimensional strips of composite Fermi liquid (CFL) and\ncomposite hole liquid (CHL), both of which break particle-hole symmetry. When\nthe CFL and CHL strips are identical in size, the resulting state is manifestly\ninvariant under the combined action of a particle-hole transformation with\nrespect to a single Landau level (which interchanges the CFL and CHL) and\ntranslation by one unit, equal to the strip width, in the direction transverse\nto the strips. At distances long compared to the strip width, we demonstrate\nthat the system is described by a Dirac fermion coupled to an emergent gauge\nfield, with an anti-unitary particle-hole symmetry, as recently proposed by\nSon.\n", "  We report optical spectroscopy and ultrafast pump-probe measurements on the\nantiferromagnetic heavy fermion compound CePt$_2$In$_7$, a member showing\nstronger two dimensionality than other compounds in CeIn$_3$-derived\nheavy-fermion family. We identify clear and typical hybridization spectral\nstructures at low temperature from the two different spectroscopy probes.\nHowever, the strength and related energy scale of the hybridization are much\nweaker and smaller than that in the superconducting compounds CeCoIn$_5$ and\nCeIrIn$_5$. The features are more similar to observations on the\nantiferromagnetic compounds CeIn$_3$ and CeRhIn$_5$ in the same family. The\nresults clearly indicate that the Kondo interaction and hybridizations exist in\nthe antiferromagnetic compounds but with weaker strength.\n", "  In order to calculate thermal properties in automatic fashion, the\nQuasi-Harmonic Approximation (QHA) has been combined with the Automatic Phonon\nLibrary (APL) and implemented within the AFLOW framework for high-throughput\ncomputational materials science. As a benchmark test to address the accuracy of\nthe method and implementation, the specific heats, thermal expansion\ncoefficients, Gr\\\"uneisen parameters and bulk moduli have been calculated for\n130 compounds. It is found that QHA-APL can reliably predict such values for\nseveral different classes of solids with root mean square relative deviation\nsmaller than 28% with respect to experimental values. The automation,\nrobustness, accuracy and precision of QHA-APL enable the computation of large\nmaterial data sets, the implementation of repositories containing thermal\nproperties, and finally can serve the community for data mining and machine\nlearning studies.\n", "  Quantum key distribution using three states in equiangular configuration\ncombines a security threshold comparable with the one of the Bennett-Brassard\n1984 protocol and a quantum bit error rate (QBER) estimation that does not need\nto reveal part of the key. We implement an entanglement-based version of the\nRenes 2004 protocol, using only passive optic elements in a linear scheme for\nthe measurement POVM, generating an asymptotic secure key rate of more than 10\nkbit/s, with a mean QBER of 1.6%. We then demonstrate its security in the case\nof finite key and evaluate the key rate for both collective and general\nattacks.\n", "  We have examined the thermodynamic properties for a variety of spherically\nsymmetric charged-AdS black hole (BH) solutions, including the charged AdS BH\nsurrounded by quintessence dark energy and charged AdS BH in $f(R)$ gravity in\n\\emph{extended phase-space}. This framework involves treating the cosmological\nconstant as thermodynamic variable (for example: thermodynamic pressure and\nthermodynamic volume). Then they should behave as an analog of Van der Waal\n(VdW) like systems. In the extended phase space we have calculated the\n\\emph{entropy product} and \\emph{thermodynamic volume product} of all horizons.\nThe mass (or enthalpy) independent nature of the said product signals they are\n\\emph{universal} quantities. %Various type of phase diagram of the specific\nheat has been drawn. The divergence of the specific heat indicates that the\nsecond order phase transition occurs under certain condition. In the\nappendix-A, we have studied the thermodynamic volume products for axisymmetric\nspacetime and it is shown to be \\emph{not universal} in nature. Finally, in\nappendix-B, we have studied the $P-V$ criticality of Cauchy horizon for\ncharged-AdS BH and found to be an universal relation of critical values between\ntwo horizons as $P_{c}^{-} = P_{c}^{+}$, $v_{c}^{-}=v_{c}^{+}$, $T_{c}^{-} =\n-T_{c}^{+}$, $\\rho_{c}^{-} = -\\rho_{c}^{+}$. The symbols are defined in the\nmain work.\n", "  We propose the study of new observables in LHC inclusive events with three\ntagged jets, one in the forward direction, one in the backward direction and\nboth well-separated in rapidity from the each other (Mueller-Navelet jets),\ntogether with a third jet tagged in central regions of rapidity. Since\nnon-tagged associated mini-jet multiplicity is allowed, we argue that\nprojecting the cross sections on azimuthal-angle components can provide several\ndistinct tests of the BFKL dynamics. Realistic LHC kinematical cuts are\nintroduced.\n", "  A new scenario for energy distribution, security and shareability is\npresented that assumes the availability of quantum information heat engines and\na thermal bath. It is based on the convertibility between entropy and work in\nthe presence of a thermal reservoir. Our approach to the informational content\nof physical systems that are distributed between users is complementary to the\nconventional perspective of quantum communication. The latter places the value\non the unpredictable content of the transmitted quantum states, while our\ninterest focuses on their certainty. Some well-known results in quantum\ncommunication are reused in this context. Particularly, we describe a way to\nsecurely distribute quantum states to be used for unlocking energy from thermal\nsources. We also consider some multi-partite entangled and classically\ncorrelated states for a collaborative multi-user sharing of work extraction\npossibilities. Besides, the relation between the communication and work\nextraction capabilities is analyzed and written as an equation.\n", "  Exact solutions to Einstein's equations for holographic models are presented\nand studied. The IR geometry has a timelike cousin of the Kasner singularity,\nwhich is the less generic case of the BKL (Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz)\nsingularity, and the UV is asymptotically AdS. This solution describes a\nholographic RG flow between them. The solution's appearance is an interpolation\nbetween the planar AdS black hole and the AdS soliton. The causality constraint\nis always satisfied. The entanglement entropy and Wilson loops are discussed.\nThe boundary condition for the current-current correlation function and the\nLaplacian in the IR is examined. There is no infalling wave in the IR, but\ninstead, there is a normalizable solution in the IR. In a special case, a\nhyperscaling-violating geometry is obtained after a dimensional reduction.\n", "  We explore the effects of artificial $U(3)$ gauge potentials on ultracold\natoms. We study background gauge fields with both non-constant and constant\nWilson loops around plaquettes, obtaining the energy spectra in each case. The\nscenario of metal-insulator transition for irrational fluxes is also examined.\nFinally, we discuss the effect of such a gauge potential on the\nsuperfluid-insulator transition for bosonic ultracold atoms.\n", "  Measurements of $C\\!P$ observables in $B^\\pm \\rightarrow D K^\\pm$ and $B^\\pm\n\\rightarrow D \\pi^\\pm$ decays are presented where the $D$ meson is\nreconstructed in the final states $K^\\pm\\pi^\\mp$, $\\pi^\\pm K^\\mp$, $K^+K^-$,\n$\\pi^+\\pi^-$, $K^\\pm\\pi^\\mp \\pi^+ \\pi^-$, $\\pi^\\pm K^\\mp \\pi^+ \\pi^-$ and\n$\\pi^+ \\pi^- \\pi^+ \\pi^-$. This analysis uses a sample of charged $B$ mesons\nfrom $pp$ collisions collected by the LHCb experiment in 2011 and 2012,\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 fb$^{-1}$. Various\n\\CP-violating effects are reported and together these measurements provide\nimportant input for the determination of the unitarity triangle angle $\\gamma$.\nThe analysis of the four-pion $D$ decay mode is the first of its kind.\n", "  Using the coherent state functional integral expression of the partition\nfunction, we show that the sine-Gordon model on an analogue curved spacetime\narises as the effective quantum field theory for phase fluctuations of a weakly\nimperfect Bose gas on an incompressible background superfluid flow when these\nfluctuations are restricted to a subspace of the single-particle Hilbert space.\nWe consider bipartitions of the single-particle Hilbert space relevant to\nexperiments on ultracold bosonic atomic or molecular gases, including, e.g.,\nrestriction to high- or low-energy sectors of the dynamics and spatial\nbipartition corresponding to tunnel-coupled planar Bose gases. By assuming full\nunitary quantum control in the low-energy subspace of a trapped gas, we show\nthat (1) appropriately tuning the particle number statistics of the\nlowest-energy mode partially decouples the low- and high-energy sectors,\nallowing any low-energy single-particle wave function to define a background\nfor sine-Gordon dynamics on curved spacetime and (2) macroscopic occupation of\na quantum superposition of two states of the lowest two modes produces an\nanalogue curved spacetime depending on two background flows, with respective\nweights continuously dependent on the corresponding weights of the superposed\nquantum states.\n", "  We design spin filters for particles with potentially arbitrary spin S (=\n1/2, 1, 3/2,....) using a one-dimensional periodic chain of magnetic atoms as a\nquantum device. Describing the system within a tight-binding formalism we\npresent an analytical method to unravel the analogy between a one-dimensional\nmagnetic chain and a multi-strand ladder network. This analogy is crucial, and\nis subsequently exploited to engineer gaps in the energy spectrum by an\nappropriate choice of the magnetic substrate. We obtain an exact correlation\nbetween the magnitude of the spin of the incoming beam of particles and the\nmagnetic moment of the substrate atoms in the chain desired for opening up of a\nspectral gap. Results of spin polarized transport, calculated within a transfer\nmatrix formalism, are presented for particles having half-integer as well as\nhigher spin states. We find that the chain can be made to act as a quantum\ndevice which opens a transmission window only for selected spin components over\ncertain ranges of the Fermi energy, blocking them in the remaining part of the\nspectrum. The results appear to be robust even when the choice of the substrate\natoms deviates substantially from the ideal situation, as verified by extending\nthe ideas to the case of a spin spiral. Interestingly, the spin spiral\ngeometry, apart from exhibiting the filtering effect, is also seen to act as a\ndevice flipping spins - an effect that can be monitored by an interplay of the\nsystem size and the period of the spiral. Our scheme is applicable to ultracold\nquantum gases, and might inspire future experiments in this direction.\n", "  HgTe quantum wells possess remarkable physical properties as for instance the\nquantum spin Hall state and the 'single-valley' analog of graphene, depending\non their layer thicknesses and barrier composition. However, double HgTe\nquantum wells yet contain more fascinating and still unrevealed features. Here\nwe report on the study of the quantum phase transitions in tunnel-coupled HgTe\nlayers separated by CdTe barrier. We demonstrate that this system has a 3/2\npseudo spin degree of freedom, which features a number of particular properties\nassociated with the spin-dependent coupling between HgTe layers. We discover a\nspecific metal phase arising in a wide range of HgTe and CdTe layer\nthicknesses, in which a gapless bulk and a pair of helical edge states coexist.\nThis phase holds some properties of bilayer graphene such as an unconventional\nquantum Hall effect and an electrically-tunable band gap. In this 'bilayer\ngraphene' phase, electric field opens the band gap and drives the system into\nthe quantum spin Hall state. Furthermore, we discover a new type of quantum\nphase transition arising from a mutual inversion between second electron- and\nhole-like subbands. This work paves the way towards novel materials based on\nmulti-layered topological insulators.\n", "  In this work we consider electromagnetic dynamics in Randall-Sundrum branes.\nIt is derived a family of four-dimensional spacetimes compatible with\nRandall-Sundrum brane worlds, focusing on asymptotic flat backgrounds. Maximal\nextensions of the solutions are constructed and their causal structures are\ndiscussed. These spacetimes include singular, non-singular and extreme black\nholes. Maxwell's electromagnetic field is introduced and its evolution is\nstudied in an extensive numerical survey. Electromagnetic quasinormal mode\nspectra are derived and analyzed with time-dependent and high-order WKB\nmethods. Our results indicate that the black holes in the brane are\nelectromagnetically stable.\n", "  Impurities, which are inherently present in any real material, may play an\nimportant role in the magnetism of frustrated spin systems with spin-liquid\nground states. We address the impurity issue in quantum kagome antiferromagnets\nby investigating ZnCu$_3$(OH)$_6$SO$_4$ (Zn-brochantite) by means of muon spin\nspectroscopy. We show that muons couple to the impurity magnetism, originating\nfrom Cu-Zn intersite disorder, and that the impurities are highly correlated\nwith the kagome spins, allowing us to probe the intrinsic kagome physics via a\nKondo-like effect. The low-temperature plateau in local susceptibility\nidentifies the spin-liquid ground state as being gapless. The corresponding\nspin fluctuations exhibit an unconventional spectral density and an intriguing\nfield dependence.\n", "  In the present work we develop a strictly Hamiltonian approach to\nThermodynamics. A thermodynamic description based on symplectic geometry is\nintroduced, where all thermodynamic processes can be described within the\nframework of Analytic Mechanics. Our proposal is constructed on top of a usual\nsymplectic manifold, where phase space is even dimensional and one has\nwell-defined Poisson brackets. The main idea is the introduction of an extended\nphase space where thermodynamic equations of state are realized as constraints.\nWe are then able to apply the canonical transformation toolkit to thermodynamic\nproblems. Throughout this development, Dirac's theory of constrained systems is\nextensively used. To illustrate the formalism, we consider paradigmatic\nexamples, namely, the ideal, van der Waals and Clausius gases.\n", "  Fully characterizing the steerability of a quantum state of a bipartite\nsystem has remained an open problem since the concept of steerability was\ndefined. In this work, using our recent geometrical approach to steerability,\nwe suggest a necessary and sufficient condition for a two-qubit state to be\nsteerable with respect to projective measurements. To this end, we define the\ncritical radius of local models and show that a state of two qubits is\nsteerable with respect to projective measurements from Alice's side if and only\nif her critical radius of local models is less than $1$. As an example, we\ncalculate the critical radius of local models for the so-called T-states by\nproving the optimality of a recently-suggested ansatz for Alice's local hidden\nstate model.\n", "  We explore the effect of varying the mass of the seed black hole on the\nresulting black hole mass - bulge mass relation at z ~ 0, using a semi-analytic\nmodel of galaxy formation combined with large cosmological N-body simulations.\nWe constrain our model by requiring the observed properties of galaxies at z ~\n0 are reproduced. In keeping with previous semi-analytic models, we place a\nseed black hole immediately after a galaxy forms. When the mass of the seed is\nset at 10^5 M_sun, we find that the model results become inconsistent with\nrecent observational results of the black hole mass - bulge mass relation for\ndwarf galaxies. In particular, the model predicts that bulges with ~ 10^9 M_sun\nharbour larger black holes than observed. On the other hand, when we employ\nseed black holes with 10^3 M_sun, or randomly select their mass within a\n10^(3-5) M_sun range, the resulting relation is consistent with observation\nestimates, including the observed dispersion. We find that to obtain stronger\nconstraints on the mass of seed black holes, observations of less massive\nbulges at z ~ 0 are a more powerful comparison than the relations at higher\nredshifts.\n", "  We prove that for a given operator in the Standard Model (SM) with baryon\nnumber B and lepton number L, that the operator's dimension is even (odd) if\n(B-L)/2 is even (odd). Consequently, this establishes the veracity of\nstatements that were long observed or expected to be true, but not proven,\ne.g., operators with B-L=0 are of even dimension, B-L must be an even number,\netc. These results remain true even if the SM is augmented by any number of\nright-handed neutrinos with L=1.\n", "  We present the calculation of the cross section and invariant mass\ndistribution for Higgs boson pair production in gluon fusion at next-to-leading\norder (NLO) in QCD. Top-quark masses are fully taken into account throughout\nthe calculation. The virtual two-loop amplitude has been generated using an\nextension of the program GoSam supplemented with an interface to Reduze for the\nintegral reduction. The occurring integrals have been calculated numerically\nusing the program SecDec. Our results, including the full top-quark mass\ndependence for the first time, allow us to assess the validity of various\napproximations proposed in the literature, which we also recalculate. We find\nsubstantial deviations between the NLO result and the different approximations,\nwhich emphasizes the importance of including the full top-quark mass dependence\nat NLO.\n", "  It is generally believed that the laws of thermodynamics govern\nsuperconductivity as an equilibrium state of matter. Here we point out that\nwithin the conventional BCS-London description of the normal-superconductor\ntransition in the presence of a magnetic field, the transition cannot be\nreversible, in contradiction with the thermodynamic description and with\nexperiments. This indicates that the conventional theory of superconductivity\nis internally inconsistent. We argue that to describe a reversible transition\nit is necessary to assume that charge transfer occurs across the\nnormal-superconductor phase boundary, as proposed in the theory of hole\nsuperconductiviy. This provides also a solution to the angular momentum puzzle\npointed out in previous work. Our explanation can only apply if the current\ncarriers in the normal state are holes. An experimental test of these ideas is\nproposed.\n", "  The problem of an impurity particle moving through a bosonic medium plays a\nfundamental role in physics. However, the canonical scenario of a mobile\nimpurity immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) has not yet been\nrealized. Here, we use radio frequency spectroscopy of ultracold bosonic\n$^{39}$K atoms to experimentally demonstrate the existence of a well-defined\nquasiparticle state of an impurity interacting with a BEC. We measure the\nenergy of the impurity both for attractive and repulsive interactions, and find\nexcellent agreement with theories that incorporate three-body correlations,\nboth in the weak-coupling limits and across unitarity. The spectral response\nconsists of a well-defined quasiparticle peak at weak coupling, while for\nincreasing interaction strength, the spectrum is strongly broadened and becomes\ndominated by the many-body continuum of excited states. Crucially, no\nsignificant effects of three-body decay are observed. Our results open up\nexciting prospects for studying mobile impurities in a bosonic environment and\nstrongly interacting Bose systems in general.\n", "  A direct and non-trivial link between Padmanabhan's entropy used in emergent\ngravity and standard GR action is established. To do that, Augmented\nVariational Principles (AVP) will be used. We shall discuss how this link\naccounts for the details of the variation of Padmanabhan's action based on\ngravitational entropy. It will also clarify the role of the background metric\nand its non-dynamical role.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the Universe at the late stage of its evolution\nand deep inside the cell of uniformity. At these scales, we can consider the\nUniverse to be filled with dust-like matter in the form of discretely\ndistributed galaxies, a $K$-essence scalar field, playing the role of dark\nenergy, and radiation as matter sources. We investigate such a Universe in the\nmechanical approach. This means that the peculiar velocities of the\ninhomogeneities (in the form of galaxies) as well as the fluctuations of the\nother perfect fluids are non-relativistic. Such fluids are designated as\ncoupled because they are concentrated around the inhomogeneities. In the\npresent paper, we investigate the conditions under which the $K$-essence scalar\nfield with the most general form for its action can become coupled. We\ninvestigate at the background level three particular examples of the\n$K$-essence models: (i) the pure kinetic $K$-essence field, (ii) a $K$-essence\nwith a constant speed of sound and (iii) the $K$-essence model with the\nLagrangian $bX+cX^2-V(\\phi)$. We demonstrate that if the $K$-essence is\ncoupled, all these $K$-essence models take the form of multicomponent perfect\nfluids where one of the component is the cosmological constant. Therefore, they\ncan provide the late-time cosmic acceleration and be simultaneously compatible\nwith the mechanical approach.\n", "  Discrete-time quantum walks allow Floquet topological insulator materials to\nbe explored using controllable systems such as ultracold atoms in optical\nlattices. By numerical simulations, we study the robustness of topologically\nprotected edge states in the presence of decoherence in one- and\ntwo-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks. We also develop a simple\nanalytical model quantifying the robustness of these edge states against either\nspin or spatial dephasing, predicting an exponential decay of the population of\ntopologically protected edge states. Moreover, we present an experimental\nproposal based on neutral atoms in spin-dependent optical lattices to realize\nspatial boundaries between distinct topological phases. Our proposal relies on\na new scheme to implement spin-dependent discrete shift operations in a\ntwo-dimensional optical lattice. We analyze under realistic decoherence\nconditions the experimental feasibility of observing unidirectional,\ndissipationless transport of matter waves along boundaries separating distinct\ntopological domains.\n", "  In reconstituting k-mer models, extended objects which occupy several sites\non a one dimensional lattice, undergo directed or undirected diffusion, and\nreconstitute -when in contact- by transferring a single monomer unit from one\nk-mer to the other; the rates depend on the size of participating k-mers. This\npolydispersed system has two conserved quantities, the number of k-mers and the\npacking fraction. We provide a matrix product method to write the steady state\nof this model and to calculate the spatial correlation functions analytically.\nWe show that for a constant reconstitution rate, the spatial correlation\nexhibits damped oscillations in some density regions separated, from other\nregions with exponential decay, by a disorder surface. In a specific limit,\nthis constant-rate reconstitution model is equivalent to a single dimer model\nand exhibits a phase coexistence similar to the one observed earlier in totally\nasymmetric simple exclusion process on a ring with a defect.\n", "  We give the first construction of a family of quantum-proof extractors that\nhas optimal seed length dependence $O(\\log(n/\\varepsilon))$ on the input length\n$n$ and error $\\varepsilon$. Our extractors support any min-entropy\n$k=\\Omega(\\log{n} + \\log^{1+\\alpha}(1/\\varepsilon))$ and extract\n$m=(1-\\alpha)k$ bits that are $\\varepsilon$-close to uniform, for any desired\nconstant $\\alpha > 0$. Previous constructions had a quadratically worse seed\nlength or were restricted to very large input min-entropy or very few output\nbits.\n  Our result is based on a generic reduction showing that any strong classical\ncondenser is automatically quantum-proof, with comparable parameters. The\nexistence of such a reduction for extractors is a long-standing open question,\nhere we give an affirmative answer for condensers. Once this reduction is\nestablished, to obtain our quantum-proof extractors one only needs to consider\nhigh entropy sources. We construct quantum-proof extractors with the desired\nparameters for such sources by extending a classical approach to extractor\nconstruction, based on the use of block-sources and sampling, to the quantum\nsetting.\n  Our extractors can be used to obtain improved protocols for\ndevice-independent randomness expansion and for privacy amplification.\n", "  Since 2014, a new detector (New-Tupi) consisting of four plastic\nscintillators ($150 \\times 75 \\times 5 cm^3$) placed in pairs and located in\nNiteroi, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, has been used for the search of transient\nsolar events and photomuons from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). On September 15,\n2015, at 21:18:24 UT, the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and\nlocated GRB 150915A (trigger 655721). The GRB light curve shows a weak complex\nstructure of long duration $T_{90}=164.7 \\pm 49.7 $ s, and a fluence in the\n15-150 keV band of $8.0 \\pm 1.8 \\times 10^{-7}erg/cm^2$. GRB 150915A was\nfortuitously located in the field of view of the New-Tupi detector, and a\nsearch for prompt emission in the GeV energy range is presented here. The\nanalysis was made using the \"scaler\" or \"single-particle\" technique. The\nNew-Tupi detector registered a counting rate excess peak of duration\n$T_{90}=(6.1\\pm 0.6)$ s with a signal significance $(4.4\\pm 0.5)\\sigma$, (and\nnot $6.9\\sigma$ as reported in the previous version). The signal is within the\nT90 duration of the Swift BAT GRB, with an estimated \"excess\" fluence of\n$F_S(E>0.1 GeV)=1.3 \\pm 0.3 \\times 10^{-6} erg/cm^2$. This value can be\nconsidered the lower limit of the gamma ray fluence in the GeV energy region.\nHowever, the Poisson probability of the event to be a background fluctuation is\n$5.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ and it appears in the counting rate of the New-Tupi\ndetector with an annual rate $\\sim 76$. In addition, the signal has a\nsignificance of only $2\\sigma$ in the time profiles with a bin above 2 seconds.\nThus we conclude that the event has a high probability to be background\nfluctuation.\n", "  We theoretically study the transport of time-bin entangled photon pairs in a\ntwo-dimensional topological photonic system of coupled ring resonators. This\nsystem implements the integer quantum Hall model using a synthetic gauge field\nand exhibits topologically robust edge states. We show that the transport\nthrough edge states preserves temporal correlations of entangled photons\nwhereas bulk transport does not preserve these correlations and can lead to\nsignificant unwanted temporal bunching or anti-bunching of photons. We study\nthe effect of disorder on the quantum transport properties; while the edge\ntransport remains robust, bulk transport is very susceptible, and in the limit\nof strong disorder, bulk states become localized. We show that this\nlocalization is manifested as an enhanced bunching/anti-bunching of photons.\nThis topologically robust transport of correlations through edge states could\nenable robust on-chip quantum communication channels and delay lines for\ninformation encoded in temporal correlations of photons.\n", "  We show a new way to stabilize epitaxial structures against transforming bulk\nstable phases for Fe thin films on a vicinal Cu(001) surface.\nAtomically-resolved observations by scanning tunneling microscopy reveal that\nhigh-density Cu steps serve as strain relievers for keeping\nepitaxially-stabilized Fe fcc(001) lattice even at a transient thickness\ntowards the bulk stable bcc(110) lattice. Spectroscopic measurements further\nclarify the intrinsic electronic properties of the fcc Fe thin film in real\nspace, implying electronic differences between 6 and 7 monolayer thick films\ninduced by the modification of the lattice constant in the topmost layers.\n", "  In this paper, we have studied the kink and antikink solutions in several\nneutral scalar models in 1+1 dimension. We follow the standard approach to\nwrite down the leading order and the second order force between long distance\nseparated kink and antikink. The leading order force is proportional to\nexponential decay with respect to the distance between the two nearest kinks or\nantikinks. The second order force have a similar behavior with the larger decay\nfactor, namely $3\\over 2$. We make use of these properties to construct the\nkink lattice. The dynamics of the kink lattice with leading order force can be\nidentified as ordinary nonperiodic Toda lattice. Also the periodic Toda lattice\ncan be obtained when the number of kink lattice is even. The system of kink\nlattice with force up to the next order corresponds to a new specific\ndeformation of Toda lattice system. There is no well study on this deformation\nin the integrable literatures.We found that the deformed Toda system are near\nintegrable system, since the integrability are hindered by high order\ncorrection terms. Our work provides a effective theory for kink interactions\nand a new near or quasi integrable model.\n", "  We present the results obtained from imaging observations, and search for\nradio pulsations towards the magnetar SGR J1935+2154 made using the Giant\nMetrewave Radio Telescope, and the Ooty Radio Telescope. We present the high\nresolution radio image of the supernova remnant (SNR) G57.2+0.8, which is\npositionally associated with SGR J1935+2154. We did not detect significant\nperiodic radio pulsations from the magnetar, with 8$\\sigma$ upper limits on its\nflux density of 0.4, and 0.2 mJy at 326.5, and 610 MHz, respectively, for an\nassumed duty cycle of 10\\%. The corresponding 6$\\sigma$ upper limits at the two\nfrequencies for any burst emission with an assumed width of 10 ms are 0.5 Jy,\nand 63 mJy, respectively. No continuum radio point source was detected at the\nposition of SGR J1935+2154 with a 3$\\sigma$ upper limit of 1.2 mJy. We also did\nnot detect significant diffuse radio emission in a radius of 70 arc seconds in\ncoincidence with the diffuse X-ray emission reported recently, with a 3$\\sigma$\nupper limit of 4.5 mJy. Using the archival HI spectra, we estimate the distance\nof SNR G57.2+0.8 to be 11.7 $\\pm$ 2.8 kpc. Based on measured HI column density\n(N$_H$) along this line of sight, we argue that the magnetar could be\nphysically associated with SNR G57.2+0.8. Based on present data, we can not\nrule out either a pulsar wind nebula or a dust scattering halo origin for the\ndiffuse X-ray emission seen around the magnetar.\n", "  On 2006 August 23 the Crab Pulsar underwent a glitch, that was reported by\nthe Jodrell Bank and the Xinjiang radio observatories. Neither data are\navailable to the public. However, the Jodrell group publishes monthly arrival\ntimes of the Crab Pulsar pulse (their actual observations are done daily),\nusing which it is shown that about five months earlier, the Crab Pulsar most\nprobably underwent a small glitch, which has not been reported before. Neither\nobservatory discusses the detailed analysis of data from 2006 March to August;\neither they may not have detected this small glitch, or may have attributed it\nto timing noise in the Crab Pulsar. The above result is verified using X-ray\ndata from the RXTE observatory. If this is indeed true, this may probably be\nthe smallest glitch observed in the Crab Pulsar so far, whose implications are\ndiscussed. This work addresses the confusion possible between small magnitude\nglitches and timing noise in pulsars.\n", "  We perform a detailed study of the geodesic equations in the spacetime of the\nstatic and rotating charged black hole corresponding to the Kerr-Newman-(A)dS\nspacetime. We derive the equations of motion for test particles and light rays\nand present their solutions in terms of the Weierstrass $\\wp$, $\\zeta$ and\n$\\sigma$ functions as well as the Kleinian $\\sigma$ function. With the help of\nparametric diagrams and effective potentials we analyze the geodesic motion and\nclassify the possible orbit types. This spacetime is also a solution of $f(R)$\ngravity with a constant curvature scalar.\n", "  This mini-review synthesizes our understanding of the equilibrium behavior of\nparticle models with short-range attractive and long-range repulsive (SALR)\ninteractions. These models, which can form stable periodic microphases, aim to\nreproduce the essence of colloidal suspensions with competing interactions.\nOrdered structures, however, have yet to be obtained in experiments. In order\nto better understand the hurdles to periodic microphase assembly, marked\ntheoretical and simulation advances have been made over the last few years.\nHere, we present recent progress in the study of microphases in models with\nSALR interactions using liquid-state theory and density-functional theory as\nwell as numerical simulations. Combining these various approaches provides a\ndescription of periodic microphases, and give insights into the rich\nphenomenology of the surrounding disordered regime. Three additional ongoing\nresearch directions in the thermodynamics of models with SALR interactions are\nalso presented.\n", "  The study of the iron-based superconductor FeSe has blossomed with the\navailability of high quality single crystals, obtained through\nflux/vapor-transport growth techniques below the structural transformation\ntemperature of its tetragonal phase, T~450 C. Here, we report on the variation\nof sample morphology and properties due to small modifications in the growth\nconditions. A considerable variation of the superconducting transition\ntemperature Tc, from 8.8 K to 3 K, which cannot be correlated with the sample\ncomposition, is observed. Instead, we point out a clear correlation between Tc\nand disorder, as measured by the residual resistivity ratio. Notably, the\ntetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition is also found to be quite\nstrongly disorder dependent (Ts =72 - 90 K), and linearly correlated with Tc.\n", "  The properties of molecule-optical elements such as lenses or prisms based on\nthe interaction of molecules with optical fields depend in a crucial way on the\nmolecular quantum state and its alignment created by the optical field.\nHowever, in previous experimental studies, the effects of state-dependent\nalignment have never been included in estimates of the optical dipole force\nacting on the molecules while previous theoretical investigations took the\nstate-dependent molecular alignment into account only implicitly. Herein, we\nconsider the effects of molecular alignment explicitly and, to this end,\nintroduce an effective polarizability which takes proper account of molecular\nalignment and is directly related to the alignment-dependent optical dipole\nforce. We illustrate the significance of including molecular alignment in the\noptical dipole force by a trajectory study that compares previously used\napproximations with the present approach. The trajectory simulations were\ncarried out for an ensemble of linear molecules subject to either propagating\nor standing-wave optical fields for a range of temperatures and laser\nintensities. The results demonstrate that the alignment-dependent effective\npolarizability can serve to provide correct estimates of the optical dipole\nforce, on which a state-selection method applicable to nonpolar molecules could\nbe based. We note that an analogous analysis of the forces acting on polar\nmolecules subject to an inhomogeneous static electric field reveals a similarly\nstrong dependence on molecular orientation.\n", "  Random sequential adsorption (RSA) of various two dimensional objects is\nstudied in order to find a shape which maximizes the saturated packing\nfraction. This investigation was begun in our previous paper [Cie\\'sla et al.,\nPhys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 17, 24376 (2015)], where the densest packing was\nstudied for smoothed dimers. Here this shape is compared with a smoothed\n$n$-mers, spherocylinders and ellipses. It is found that the highest packing\nfraction out of the studied shapes is $0.58405 \\pm 0.0001$ and is obtained for\nellipses having long-to-short axis ratio of $1.85$, which is also the largest\nanisotropy among the investigated shapes.\n", "  Using circuit QED, we consider the measurement of a superconducting transmon\nqubit via a coupled microwave resonator. For ideally dispersive coupling,\nringing up the resonator produces coherent states with frequencies matched to\ntransmon energy states. Realistic coupling is not ideally dispersive, however,\nso transmon-resonator energy levels hybridize into joint eigenstate ladders of\nthe Jaynes-Cummings type. Previous work has shown that ringing up the resonator\napproximately respects this ladder structure to produce a coherent state in the\neigenbasis (a dressed coherent state). We numerically investigate the validity\nof this coherent state approximation to find two primary deviations. First,\nresonator ring-up leaks small stray populations into eigenstate ladders\ncorresponding to different transmon states. Second, within an eigenstate ladder\nthe transmon nonlinearity shears the coherent state as it evolves. We then show\nthat the next natural approximation for this sheared state in the eigenbasis is\na dressed squeezed state, and derive simple evolution equations for such states\nusing a hybrid phase-Fock-space description.\n", "  A search for heavy long-lived charged $R$-hadrons is reported using a data\nsample corresponding to 3.2$^{-1}$ of proton--proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s} =\n13$ TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.\nThe search is based on observables related to large ionisation losses and slow\npropagation velocities, which are signatures of heavy charged particles\ntravelling significantly slower than the speed of light. No significant\ndeviations from the expected background are observed. Upper limits at 95%\nconfidence level are provided on the production cross section of long-lived\n$R$-hadrons in the mass range from 600 GeV to 2000 GeV and gluino, bottom and\ntop squark masses are excluded up to 1580 GeV, 805 GeV and 890 GeV,\nrespectively.\n", "  Dynamics induced by a change of boundary conditions reveals rate-dependent\nsignatures associated with topological properties in one-dimensional Kitaev\nchain and SSH model. While the perturbation from a change of the boundary\npropagates into the bulk, the density of topological edge modes in the case of\ntransforming to open boundary condition reaches steady states. The steady-state\ndensity depends on the transformation rate of the boundary and serves as an\nillustration of quantum memory effects in topological systems. Moreover, while\na link is physically broken as the boundary condition changes, some correlation\nfunctions can remain finite across the broken link and keep a record of the\ninitial condition. By testing those phenomena in the non-topological regimes of\nthe two models, none of the interesting signatures of memory effects can be\nobserved. Our results thus contrast the importance of topological properties in\nboundary-induced dynamics.\n", "  Using Relativistic Quantum Geometry we show that the entropy can decrease in\nvery small BHs, under certain circumstances, but always increases in very\nmassive Black-Holes.\n", "  It is well known fact that gravitational field can alter the space-time\nstructure and gravitational redshift is its one example. Electromagnetic field\ncan also alter the space-time similar to gravitational field. So\nelectromagnetic field can give rise to an additional effect on gravitational\nredshift. There are many objects in nature, like neutron stars, magnetars etc\nwhich have high amount of rotation and magnetic field. In the present paper we\nwill derive the expression of gravitational redshift from rotating body having\nintense magnetic field by using the action function of the electromagnetic\nfields.\n", "  We study the crossover from strong to weak localization of hard-core bosons\non a two dimensional honeycomb lattice in a magnetic field, as motivated by\nrecent experiments on structured films. Taking into account long range Coulomb\ninteractions among the bosons, an effective mobility edge in the excitation\nspectrum of the insulating Bose glass is identified as the (intensive) energy\nscale at which excitations become nearly delocalized. Within the forward\nscattering approximation in the bosonic hopping we find the effective mobility\nedge $\\epsilon_c$ to oscillate periodically with the magnetic flux per\nplaquette, $\\phi$. We find non-analytic cusps in $\\epsilon_c(\\phi)$ at integer\nor half-integer flux. The bosonic magneto-oscillations start with an increase\nof the mobility edge (and thus of resistance) with applied flux, in contrast to\nthe equivalent fermionic problem. The amplitude of the oscillations is much\nmore substantial in bosons than in fermions. Bosons exhibit a single hump per\nflux period, while fermion characteristics undergo two humps. Those are\nidentical for non-interacting fermions, but Coulomb correlations are shown to\nlead to systematic deviations from this statistical period doubling. Our theory\nreproduces several key features observed in the activated magneto-transport in\nstructured films.\n", "  When individuals interact with each other and meaningfully contribute toward\na common goal, it results in a collaboration, as can be seen in many walks of\nlife such as scientific research, motion picture production, or team sports.\nThe artifacts resulting from a collaboration (e.g. papers, movies) are best\ncaptured using a hypergraph model, whereas the relation of who has collaborated\nwith whom is best captured via an abstract simplicial complex (SC). In this\npaper, we propose a generative algorithm GeneSCs for SCs modeling fundamental\ncollaboration relations, primarily based on preferential attachment. The\nproposed network growth process favors attachment that is preferential not to\nan individual's degree, i.e., how many people has he/she collaborated with, but\nto his/her facet degree, i.e., how many maximal groups or facets has he/she\ncollaborated within. Unlike graphs, in SCs, both facet degrees (of nodes) and\nfacet sizes are important to capture connectivity properties. Based on our\nobservation that several real-world facet size distributions have significant\ndeviation from power law-mainly due to the fact that larger facets tend to\nsubsume smaller ones-we adopt a data-driven approach. We seed GeneSCs with a\nfacet size distribution informed by collaboration network data and randomly\ngrow the SC facet-by-facet to generate a final SC whose facet degree\ndistribution matches real data. We prove that the facet degree distribution\nyielded by GeneSCs is power law distributed for large SCs and show that it is\nin agreement with real world co-authorship data. Finally, based on our\nintuition of collaboration formation in domains such as collaborative\nscientific experiments and movie production, we propose two variants of GeneSCs\nbased on clamped and hybrid preferential attachment schemes, and show that they\nperform well in these domains.\n", "  We report solutions for solitons of the \"accessible\" type in globally\nnonlocal nonlinear media of fractional dimension (FD), viz., for self-trapped\nmodes in the space of effective dimension $2<D\\le3$ with harmonic-oscillator\npotential whose strength is proportional to the total power of the wave field.\nThe solutions are categorized by a combination of radial, orbital and azimuthal\nquantum numbers $(n,l,m)$. They feature coaxial sets of vortical and\nnecklace-shaped rings of different orders, and can be exactly written in terms\nof special functions that include Gegenbauer polynomials, associated Laguerre\npolynomials, and associated Legendre functions. The validity of these solutions\nis verified by direct simulation. The model can be realized in various physical\nsettings emulated by FD spaces; in particular, it applies to excitons trapped\nin quantum wells.\n", "  By means of the ultrafast optical Kerr effect method coupled to optical\nheterodyne detection (OHD-OKE), we characterize the third order nonlinear\nresponse of graphene at telecom wavelength, and compare it to experimental\nvalues obtained by the Z-scan method on the same samples. From these\nmeasurements, we estimate a negative nonlinear refractive index for monolayer\ngraphene, $n_2 = - 1.1\\times 10^{-13} m^2/W$. This is in contradiction to\npreviously reported values, which leads us to compare our experimental\nmeasurements obtained by the OHD-OKE and the Z-scan method with theoretical and\nexperimental values found in the literature, and to discuss the discrepancies,\ntaking into account parameters such as doping.\n", "  In this paper, we study the covariant Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) equation in\nthe space-time generated by a cosmic string and we examine the linear\ninteraction of a DKP field with gravitational fields produced by topological\ndefects and thus study the influence of topology on this system. We highlight\ntwo classes of solutions defined by the product of the deficit angle with the\nangular velocity of the rotating frame. We solve the covariant form of DKP\nequation in an exact analytical manner for node-less and one-node states by\nmeans of an appropriate ansatz.\n", "  The Pound-Drever-Hall laser stabilization technique requires a fast,\nlow-noise photodetector. We present a simple photodetector design that uses a\ntransformer as an intermediary between a photodiode and cascaded low-noise\nradio-frequency amplifiers. Our implementation using a silicon photodiode\nyields a detector with 50 MHz bandwidth, gain $> 10^5$ V/A, and input current\nnoise $< 4$ pA/$\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$, allowing us to obtain shot-noise-limited\nperformance with low optical power.\n", "  As an alternative explanation for the cosmic acceleration, $f(R)$ theories of\ngravity can predict an almost identical expansion history to standard\n$\\Lambda$CDM, yet make very different predictions for the growth of\ncosmological structures. Measurements of the cosmic bulk flow provides a method\nfor determining the strength of gravity over the history of structure\nformation. We use the modified gravity N-body code ECOSMOG to simulate dark\nmatter particles and make predictions for the bulk flow magnitude in both\n$\\Lambda$CDM and $f(R)$ gravity. With the peculiar velocities output by ECOSMOG\nwe determine the bulk flow at depths ranging from $20h^{-1}$Mpc to\n$50h^{-1}$Mpc, following the redshift and sky distribution of the 2MASS\nTully-Fisher survey (2MTF). At each depth, we find that the $\\Lambda$CDM and\n$f_{R0} = 10^{-5}$ simulations produce bulk flow measurements that are\nconsistent with $\\Lambda$CDM predictions and the 2MTF survey at a $1\\sigma$\nlevel. We also find that adopting an $f(R)$ strength of $f_{R0} = 10^{-3}$\npredict a much larger value for the bulk flow, which disagree with $\\Lambda$CDM\npredictions at all depths considered. We conclude that $f_{R0}$ must be\nconstrained to a level no greater than $10^{-4}$ to agree with bulk flow\nmeasurements.\n", "  Over the last few decades, classical density-functional theory (DFT) and its\ndynamic extensions (DDFTs) have become powerful tools in the study of colloidal\nfluids. Recently, previous DDFTs for spherically-symmetric particles have been\ngeneralised to take into account both inertia and hydrodynamic interactions,\ntwo effects which strongly influence non-equilibrium properties. The present\nwork further generalises this framework to systems of anisotropic particles.\nStarting from the Liouville equation and utilising Zwanzig's\nprojection-operator techniques, we derive the kinetic equation for the Brownian\nparticle distribution function, and by averaging over all but one particle, a\nDDFT equation is obtained. Whilst this equation has some similarities with\nDDFTs for spherically-symmetric colloids, it involves a\ntranslational-rotational coupling which affects the diffusivity of the\n(asymmetric) particles. We further show that, in the overdamped (high friction)\nlimit, the DDFT is considerably simplified and is in agreement with a previous\nDDFT for colloids with arbitrary shape particles.\n", "  Frequency stabilization of laser light is crucial in both scientific and\nindustrial applications. Technological developments now allow analog laser\nstabilization systems to be replaced with digital electronics such as\nfield-programmable gate arrays, which have recently been utilized to develop\nsuch locking systems. We have developed a frequency stabilization system based\non a field-programmable gate array, with emphasis on hardware simplicity, which\noffers a user-friendly alternative to commercial and previous home-built\nsolutions. Frequency modulation, lock-in detection and a\nproportional-integral-derivative controller are programmed on the\nfield-programmable gate array and only minimal additional components are\nrequired to frequency stabilize a laser. The locking system is administered\nfrom a host-computer which provides comprehensive, long-distance control\nthrough a versatile interface. Various measurements were performed to\ncharacterize the system. The linewidth of the locked laser was measured to be\n$0.7 \\pm 0.1 \\; \\rm{MHz}$ with a settling time of $10 \\; \\rm{ms}$. The system\ncan thus fully match laser systems currently in use for atom trapping and\ncooling applications.\n", "  If the gamma-gamma resonance at 750 GeV suggested by 2015 LHC data turns out\nto be a real effect, what are the implications for the physics case and upgrade\npath of the International Linear Collider? Whether or not the resonance is\nconfirmed, this question provides an interesting case study testing the\nrobustness of the ILC physics case. In this note, we address this question with\ntwo points: (1) Almost all models proposed for the new 750 GeV particle require\nadditional new particles with electroweak couplings. The key elements of the\n500 GeV ILC physics program---precision measurements of the Higgs boson, the\ntop quark, and 4-fermion interactions---will powerfully discriminate among\nthese models. This information will be important in conjunction with new LHC\ndata, or alone, if the new particles accompanying the 750 GeV resonance are\nbeyond the mass reach of the LHC. (2) Over a longer term, the energy upgrade of\nthe ILC to 1 TeV already discussed in the ILC TDR will enable experiments in\ngamma-gamma and e+e- collisions to directly produce and study the 750 GeV\nparticle from these unique initial states.\n", "  Recent advances in strain engineering at the nanoscale have shown the\nfeasibility to modulate the properties of graphene. Although the\nelectron-phonon (e-ph) coupling and Kohn anomalies in graphene define the\nphonon branches contributing to the resonance Raman scattering, and is relevant\nto the electronic and thermal transport as a scattering source, the evolution\nof the e-ph coupling as a function of strain has been less studied. In this\nwork, the Kohn anomalies and the e-ph coupling in uniaxially strained graphene\nalong armchair (AC) and zigzag (ZZ) directions were studied by means of density\nfunctional perturbation theory calculations. In addition to the phonon anomaly\nat the transversal optical (TO) phonon branch in the K point for pristine\ngraphene, we found that uniaxial strain induces a discontinuity in the\nfrequency derivative of the longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonon branch. This\nbehavior corresponds to the emergence of a Kohn anomaly, as a consequence of a\nstrain-enhanced e-ph coupling. Thus, the present results for uniaxially\nstrained graphene contrast with the commonly assumed view that the e-ph\ncoupling around the K point is only present in the TO phonon branch.\n", "  The comment explains that the preprint arXiv:1503.0042 has not presented\npersuasive theoretical or experimental arguments of existence of spin\nsupercurrents in a magnon condensate prepared in a room temperature\nyttrium-iron-garnet magnetic film because the authors did not check known\ncriteria for existence of spin supercurrents in magnetically ordered materials.\nAlso they did not compare their supercurrent interpretation with a competing\nand more realistic scenario of transport by spin diffusion.\n", "  We investigate the cosmological implications of modified gravities induced by\nthe quantum fluctuations of the gravitational metric. If the metric can be\ndecomposed as the sum of the classical and of a fluctuating part, of quantum\norigin, then the corresponding Einstein quantum gravity generates at the\nclassical level modified gravity models with a nonminimal coupling between\ngeometry and matter. As a first step in our study, after assuming that the\nexpectation value of the quantum correction can be generally expressed in terms\nof an arbitrary second order tensor constructed from the metric and from the\nthermodynamic quantities characterizing the matter content of the Universe, we\nderive the (classical) gravitational field equations in their general form. We\nanalyze in detail the cosmological models obtained by assuming that the quantum\ncorrection tensor is given by the coupling of a scalar field and of a scalar\nfunction to the metric tensor, and by a term proportional to the matter\nenergy-momentum tensor. For each considered model we obtain the gravitational\nfield equations, and the generalized Friedmann equations for the case of a flat\nhomogeneous and isotropic geometry. In some of these models the divergence of\nthe matter energy-momentum tensor is non-zero, indicating a process of matter\ncreation, which corresponds to an irreversible energy flow from the\ngravitational field to the matter fluid, and which is direct consequence of the\nnonminimal curvature-matter coupling. The cosmological evolution equations of\nthese modified gravity models induced by the quantum fluctuations of the metric\nare investigated in detail by using both analytical and numerical methods, and\nit is shown that a large variety of cosmological models can be constructed,\nwhich, depending on the numerical values of the model parameters, can exhibit\nboth accelerating and decelerating behaviors.\n", "  We study dimension-seven operators in standard model effective field theory.\nThese operators are classified into two sets, one violating lepton number but\npreserving baryon number ($\\Delta L=\\pm 2$, $\\Delta B=0$) and the other\nviolating both but preserving their sum ($-\\Delta L=\\Delta B=\\pm 1$). It has\nbeen found in the previous literature that there are respectively 13 and 7 such\nindependent operators. We show that one operator is redundant in each set so\nthat the complete list contains only 12 and 6 operators respectively. We\naccomplish this by using standard model equations of motion and various Fierz\nidentities. We calculate the one-loop anomalous dimension matrix for the 6\noperators in the second set, and illustrate its possible phenomenological\nimplications by working out renormalization group running of the Wilson\ncoefficients that could contribute to the type of proton decays with $-\\Delta\nL=\\Delta B=\\pm 1$, such as $p\\to\\nu\\pi^+$.\n", "  We explore the detection limits of the phase modulation (PM) method of\nfinding binary systems among multi-periodic pulsating stars. The method is an\nattractive way of finding non-transiting planets in the habitable zones of\nintermediate mass stars, whose rapid rotation inhibits detections via the\nradial velocity (RV) method. While oscillation amplitudes of a few mmag are\nrequired to find planets, many $\\delta$ Scuti stars have these amplitudes. In\nsub-optimal cases where the signal-to-noise of the oscillations is lower,\nlow-mass brown dwarfs ($\\sim$13 M$_{\\rm Jup}$) are detectable at orbital\nperiods longer than about 1 yr, and the lowest mass main-sequence stars\n(0.1-0.2 M$_{\\odot}$) are detectable at all orbital periods where the PM method\ncan be applied. We use purpose-written Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) software\nfor the calculation of the PM orbits, which offers robust uncertainties for\ncomparison with RV solutions. Using Kepler data and ground-based RVs, we verify\nthat these two methods are in agreement, even at short orbital periods where\nthe PM method undersamples the orbit. We develop new theory to account for the\nundersampling of the time delays, which is also necessary for the inclusion of\nRVs as observational data in the MCMC software. We show that combining RVs with\ntime delays substantially refines the orbits because of the complementarity of\nworking in both the spatial (PM) and velocity (RV) domains simultaneously.\nSoftware outputs were tested through an extensive hare and hounds exercise,\ncovering a wide range of orbital configurations including binaries containing\ntwo pulsators.\n", "  We try to convince the reader that the categorical version of differential\ngeometry, called Synthetic Differential Geometry (SDG), offers valuable tools\nwhich can be applied to work with some unsolved problems of general relativity.\nWe do this with respect to the space-time singularity problem. The essential\ndifference between the usual differential geometry and SDG is that the latter\nenriches the real line by introducing infinitesimal of various kinds. Owing to\nthis geometry acquires a tool to penetrate \"infinitesimally small\" parts of a\ngiven manifold. However, to make use of this tool we must switch from the\ncategory of sets to some other suitable category. We try two topoi: the topos\n${\\cal G}$ of germ determined ideals and the so-called Basel topos ${\\cal B}$.\nThe category of manifolds is a subcategory of both of them. In ${\\cal G}$, we\nconstruct a simple model of a contracting sphere. As the sphere shrinks, its\ncurvature increases, but when the radius of the sphere reaches infinitesimal\nvalues, the curvature becomes infinitesimal and the singularity is avoided. The\ntopos ${\\cal B}$, unlike the topos ${\\cal G}$, has invertible infinitesimal and\ninfinitely large nonstandard natural numbers. This allows us to see what\nhappens when a function \"goes through a singularity\". When changing from the\ncategory of sets to another topos, one must be ready to switch from classical\nlogic to intuitionistic logic. This is a radical step, but the logic of the\nuniverse is not obliged to conform to the logic of our brains.\n", "  A recent study, making use of the number of horizontal branch stars observed\nin infrared photometric surveys and kinematic measurements of M-giant stars\nfrom the BRAVA survey, combined with N-body simulations of stellar populations,\nhas presented a new determination of the dark matter mass within the bulge-bar\nregion of the Milky Way. That study constrains the total mass within the $\\pm\n2.2 \\times \\pm 1.4 \\times \\pm 1.2$ kpc volume of the bulge-bar region to be\n($1.84 \\pm 0.07) \\times 10^{10} \\, M_{\\odot}$, of which 9-30% is made up of\ndark matter. Here, we use this result to constrain the the Milky Way's dark\nmatter density profile, and discuss the implications for indirect dark matter\nsearches. Although uncertainties remain significant, these results favor dark\nmatter distributions with a cusped density profile. For example, for a scale\nradius of 20 kpc and a local dark matter density of 0.4 GeV/cm$^3$, density\nprofiles with an inner slope of 0.69 to 1.40 are favored, approximately\ncentered around the standard NFW value. In contrast, profiles with large\nflat-density cores are disfavored by this information.\n", "  The prospects for realizing a topological quantum computer have brightened\nsince the apparent detection of Majorana fermions at the ends of semiconducting\nnanowires. These Majorana zero-modes persist in the presence of the strong\ndisorder that may be present in such systems, protected by the mobility gap of\nlocalized systems. Recent proposals to manipulate quantum information in a\nMajorana chain involve adiabatically adjusting gate voltages in one-dimensional\nnanowire networks. However, as we show, in the adiabatic limit, a disordered\nsystem with multiple zero-mode Majorana fermions will undergo a non-local\nresponse to a local perturbation via a multi-level Landau-Zener transition.\nThis will disperse the quantum information stored in the target zero-modes\namongst other zero-modes that are present in the system, complicating the\nrealization of controlled gates. There is however a solution that may work in\npractice: we show that there is an optimum window of intermediate time-scales\nduring which the quantum information is approximately preserved under\nmanipulation.\n", "  Nanodevices consisting of a quantum dot tunnel coupled to one superconducting\nand two normal electrodes may serve as a source of entangled electrons. As a\nresult of crossed Andreev reflection the Cooper pair of s-wave character may be\nsplit into two electrons and each of them goes into a distinct normal\nelectrode, preserving entanglement. Efficiency of the process depends on the\nspecific system and is tunable by electric means. Our calculations show that in\nthe studied device this efficiency may attain values as large as $80 \\%$.\n", "  The PADME experiment will search for the invisible decay of Dark Photons\nproduced in interactions of positron from the DA$\\Phi$NE Linac on a target. The\ncollaboration aims at reaching a sensitivity of $\\sim10^{-3}$ on the coupling\nconstant for values of Dark Photon masses up to $23.7\\,\\mbox{MeV}$.\n", "  We review the current status of the facility instrumentation for the Large\nBinocular Telescope (LBT). The LBT has 2x 8.4m primary mirrors on a single\nmount with an effective collecting area of 11.8m or 23m when\ninterferometrically combined. The facility instruments are: 1) the Large\nBinocular Cameras (LBCs), each with a 23'x25' field of view (FOV). The blue and\nred optimized optical LBCs are mounted at the prime focus of the left and right\nprimary mirrors, respectively. The filter suite of the two LBCs covers\n0.3-1.1{\\mu}m, including the new TiO (0.78{\\mu}m) and CN (0.82{\\mu}m) filters;\n2) the Multi-Object Double Spectrograph (MODS), two identical optical\nspectrographs each mounted at a straight through f/15 Gregorian mount. MODS-1 &\n-2 can do imaging with Sloan filters and medium resolution (R~2000)\nspectroscopy, each with 24 interchangeable masks (multi-object or longslit)\nover a 6'x6' FOV. Each MODS is capable of blue (0.32-0.6{\\mu}m) and red\n(0.5-1.05{\\mu}m) wavelength only coverage or, using a dichroic, 0.32-1.05{\\mu}m\ncoverage; and 3) the two LBT Utility Camera in the Infrared instruments\n(LUCIs), each mounted at a bent-front Gregorian f/15 port. LUCI-1 & 2 are\ndesigned for seeing-limited (4'x4'FOV) and AO (0.5'x0.5' FOV) imaging &\nspectroscopy over 0.95-2.5{\\mu}m with spectroscopic resolutions of R~400-11000,\nincluding 32 interchangeable cryogenically cooled masks. All facility\ninstruments are on the LBT and, for the first time, have been on-sky for\nscience. We also report on the first science use of \"mixed-mode\" (differently\npaired instruments). While both primary mirrors reside on a single fixed mount,\nthey are capable of operating independently within a defined \"co-pointing\"\nlimit. This provides users with the additional capability to independently\ndither each mirror or center observations on two different sets of spatial\ncoordinates within this limit. (ABRIDGED)\n", "  We study inflation in a random multifield potential, using techniques\ndeveloped by Marsh et al. The potential is a function of a large number of\nfields, and we choose parameters so that inflation only occurs in regions where\nthe potential is accidentally flat. Using an improved estimate for the dynamics\nof eigenvalue repulsion, we are able to describe the steepening of the\npotential as inflation progresses. We provide suggestive arguments, but not a\nproof, that the resulting scalar power spectrum generically disagrees with\nobservations. We also point out two problematic aspects of the model: there is\nno well-defined probability distribution for the gradient of the potential, and\nthe evolution of the potential over small distances in field space is\nunphysical.\n", "  We investigate planetary accretion that starts from equal-mass planetesimals\nusing an analytic theory and numerical simulations. We particularly focus on\nhow the planetary mass $M_{\\rm oli}$ at the onset of oligarchic growth depends\non the initial mass $m_0$ of a planetesimal. Oligarchic growth commences when\nthe velocity dispersion relative to the Hill velocity of the protoplanet takes\nits minimum. We find that if $m_0$ is small enough, this normalized velocity\ndispersion becomes as low as unity during the intermediate stage between the\nrunaway and oligarchic growth stages. In this case, $M_{\\rm oli}$ is\nindependent of $m_0$. If $m_0$ is large, on the other hand, oligarchic growth\ncommences directly after runaway growth, and $M_{\\rm oli} \\propto m_0^{3/7}$.\nThe planetary mass $M_{\\rm oli}$ for the solid surface density of the Minimum\nMass Solar Nebula is close to the masses of the dwarf planets in a reasonable\nrange of $m_0$. This indicates that they are likely to be the largest remnant\nplanetesimals that failed to become planets. The power-law exponent $q$ of the\ndifferential mass distribution of remnant planetesimals is typically $-2.0$ and\n$-2.7$ to $-2.5$ for small and large $m_0$. The slope, $q \\simeq -2.7$, and the\nbump at $10^{21}$ g (or 50 km in radius) for the mass distribution of hot\nKuiper belt objects are reproduced if $m_0$ is the bump mass. On the other\nhand, small initial planetesimals with $m_0 \\sim 10^{13}$ g or less are favored\nto explain the slope of large asteroids, $q \\simeq -2.0$, while the bump at\n$10^{21}$ g can be reproduced by introducing a small number of asteroid seeds\neach with mass of $10^{19} $ g.\n", "  Porous graphene has high mechanical strength and atomic layer thickness,\nwhich make it a promising material for material separation and biomolecule\nsensing. Electrostatic interactions between charges in aqueous solution are a\nkind of strong long-range interaction which may have great influence on the\nfluid transport through nanopores. Here, molecular dynamics simulations were\nconducted to investigate ion and water transport through a 1.05-nm-in-diameter\nmonolayer graphene nanopore with its edge charge-modified. From the results, it\nis found that the nanopores are selective to counterions when they are charged.\nAs the charge amount increases, the total ionic currents show an\nincrease-decrease profile while the co-ion currents monotonously decrease. The\nco-ions rejection can reach 75% and 90% when the nanopores are negatively and\npositively charged, respectively. Cl ions current increases and reaches a\nplateau, and Na+ current decreases with the charge amount in the systems where\nthey act as counterions. Besides, the charge modification can enhance the water\ntransport through nanopores obviously. This is mainly due to the ion selection\nof nanopores. Especially, positive charges on the pore edge facilitate the\nwater transport much more than negative charges.\n", "  Jet physics provides a powerful tool to investigate interaction properties of\nquarks and gluons. These studies have been possible at an energy never\ninvestigated before at LHC. In this proceedings we review the main\ncharacteristics of experimental methods to measure jets in proton-proton\ncollisions at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV. Novel methods are\nexpected to play an important role for searching new physics at center-of-mass\nenergy of 13 TeV.\n", "  CaFeAs2 is a parent compound of recently discovered 112-type iron-based\nsuperconductors. It is predicted to be a staggered intercalation compound that\nnaturally integrates both quantum spin Hall insulating and superconducting\nlayers and an ideal system for the realization of Majorana modes. We performed\na systematical angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principle\ncalculation study of the slightly electron-doped CaFeAs2. We found that the\nzigzag As chain of 112-type iron-based superconductors play a considerable role\nin the low-energy electronic structure, resulting in the characteristic\nDirac-cone like band dispersion as the prediction. Our experimental results\nfurther confirm that these Dirac cones only exists around the X but not Y\npoints in the Brillouin zone, breaking the S4 symmetry at iron sites. Our\nfindings present the compelling support to the theoretical prediction that the\n112-type iron-based superconductors might host the topological nontrivial edge\nstates. The slightly electron doped CaFeAs2 would provide us a unique\nopportunity to realize and explore Majorana fermion physics.\n", "  Realizing quantum Hall states in a fast rotating Bose gas is a long sought\ngoal in cold atom research. The effort is very challenging because Bose\nstatistics fights against quantum Hall correlations. In contrast, Fermi\nstatistics does not cause such conflict. Here, we show that by sweeping the\ninteger quantum Hall states of a spin-1/2 Fermi gas across the Feshbach\nresonance from the BCS side to the BEC side at a \"projection\" rate similar to\nthat in the \"projection\" experiment of fermion superfluid, these states can be\n\"fused\" into a bosonic quantum Hall states. A projection sweep means the pair\nassociation is sufficiently fast so that the center of mass of the pair remains\nunchanged in the process. We show that the fusion of integer fermion states\nwith filling factor $\\nu_{\\uparrow}=\\nu_{\\downarrow}=n$ will result in a\nbosonic Laughlin state and Pfaffian state for $n=1$ and 2. The is due to a\nhidden property of the fermionic integer quantum Hall states -- for any\ngrouping of opposite spin into pairs, their centers of mass automatically\nassume a bosonic quantum Hall structure.\n", "  We report on the proposal and experimental realization of a spoof surface\nplasmon Fabry-Perot (FP) open resonator in a surface-wave photonic crystal.\nThis surface-wave FP open resonator is formed by introducing a finite line\ndefect in a surface-wave photonic crystal. The resonance frequencies of the\nsurface-wave FP open resonator lie exactly within the forbidden band gap of the\nsurface-wave photonic crystal and the FP open resonator uses this complete\nforbidden band gap to concentrate surface waves within a subwavelength cavity.\nDue to the complete forbidden band gap of the surface-wave photonic crystal, a\nnew FP plasmonic resonance mode that exhibits monopolar features which is\nmissing in traditional FP resonators and plasmonic resonators is demonstrated.\nNear-field response spectra and mode profiles are presented in the microwave\nregime to characterize properties of the proposed FP open resonator for spoof\nsurface plasmons.\n", "  Thin films of phase pure pyrochlore Gd2Ti2O7 have been synthesized by RF\nmagnetron sputtering. The films were prepared from oxide targets in 50%O2/Ar\natmosphere and deposited on 111 YSZ substrates at a temperature of 800C. The\npyrochlore structure was confirmed via grazing angle x-ray diffraction and\nselected area electron diffraction (SAED). TEM analysis also showed that the\nfilms were dense and of uniform thickness with surface roughness of\napproximately 8nm. The total conductivity measured with AC impedance\nspectroscopy was found to be independent of thickness and comparable in\nmagnitude to that of bulk Gd2Ti2O7. Differences were observed in the Arrhenius\nbehavior between the bulk and thin film samples and are attributed to varying\nlevels of background impurities.\n", "  Fucoidan is a generic term for a class of fucose rich, structurally diverse\nsulfated polysaccharides that are found in brown algae and other marine\norganisms. Depending on the species from which the fucoidan is extracted, a\nwide variety of biological activities including antitumor, antiinflammatory,\nimmune-modulating, antiviral, antibacterial and pro- and anticoagulant\nactivities has been described. Fucoidans have the advantage of low toxicity and\noral bioavailibiity and are viable drug candidates, preclinical and pilot\nclinical trials show promising results. The availability of robust assays, in\nparticular for analysing the blood levels of fucoidan, is a fundamental\nrequirement for pharmacokinetic analysis in drug development projects. This\ncontribution describes the application of a commercially availbale,\nprotein-free fluorescent probe assay (Heparin Red) for the direct\nquantification of several fucoidans (from Fucus vesiculosus, Macrocystis\npyrifera, and Undaria pinnatifida) in human plasma. By only minor adapation of\nthe established protocol for heparin detection, a concentration range 0,5 to 20\nmicrogram per mL fucoidan can be addressed. A preliminary analysis of matrix\neffects suggests acceptable interindividual variability and no interference by\nendogeneous chondroitin sulfate. This study identifies the Heparin Red assay as\na simple, time-saving mix-and-read method for the quantification of fucoidans\nin human plasma.\n", "  We present measurements on gate-defined double quantum dots in Ge-Si\ncore-shell nanowires, which we tune to a regime with visible shell filling in\nboth dots. We observe a Pauli spin blockade and can assign the measured leakage\ncurrent at low magnetic fields to spin-flip cotunneling, for which we measure a\nstrong anisotropy related to an anisotropic g-factor. At higher magnetic fields\nwe see signatures for leakage current caused by spin-orbit coupling between\n(1,1)-singlet and (2,0)-triplet states. Taking into account these anisotropic\nspin-flip mechanisms, we can choose the magnetic field direction with the\nlongest spin lifetime for improved spin-orbit qubits.\n", "  We examine the problem of estimating the trace of a matrix $A$ when given\naccess to an oracle which computes $x^\\dagger A x$ for an input vector $x$. We\nmake use of the basis vectors from a set of mutually unbiased bases, widely\nstudied in the field of quantum information processing, in the selection of\nprobing vectors $x$. This approach offers a new state of the art single shot\nsampling variance while requiring only $O(\\log(n))$ random bits to generate\neach vector. This significantly improves on traditional methods such as\nHutchinson's and Gaussian estimators in terms of the number of random bits\nrequired and worst case sample variance.\n", "  We have investigated the microwave properties of epoxy-based composites\ncontaining melt-extracted Co69.25Fe4. 25B13.5-xSi13Nbx (x=0, 1, 3) microwires\nof various length annealed using a so-called combined current-modulation\nannealing (CCMA) technique. The observation of a double-peak feature in the\npermittivity spectra is believed due to the coexistence of the amorphous phase\nand a small amount of nanocrystallites on the wires with a high Nb content.\nCCMA was found to be favorable for a better-defined circular anisotropy of\nmicrowires and had suppressed the highfrequency peak due to residual stress\nrelief for the composite with 25 mm long wires. Neither the shift of resonance\npeak nor the characteristic double peak feature was detected for composites\ncontaining as-cast 15 or 35 mm long microwires.\n", "  We studied a solar flare with pronounced quasi-periodic pulsations detected\nin the microwave, X-ray, and radio bands. We used the methods of correlation,\nFourier, and wavelet analyses to examine the temporal fine structures and\nrelationships between the time profiles in each wave band. We found that the\ntime profiles of the microwaves, hard X-rays and type III radio bursts vary\nquasi-periodically with the common period of 40-50 s. The average amplitude of\nthe variations is high, above 30% of the background flux level and reaching 80%\nafter the flare maximum. We did not find the periodicity in either the thermal\nX-ray flux component or source size dynamics. Our findings indicate that the\ndetected periodicity is likely to be associated with periodic dynamics in the\ninjection of non-thermal electrons, that can be produced by periodic modulation\nof magnetic reconnection.\n", "  Due to its rapid development in the past decade, air transportation system\nhas attracted considerable research attention from diverse communities. While\nmost of the previous studies focused on airline networks, here we\nsystematically explore the robustness of the Chinese air route network, and\nidentify the vital edges which form the backbone of Chinese air transportation\nsystem. Specifically, we employ a memetic algorithm to minimize the network\nrobustness after removing certain edges hence the solution of this model is the\nset of vital edges. Counterintuitively, our results show that the most vital\nedges are not necessarily the edges of highest topological importance, for\nwhich we provide an extensive explanation from the microscope of view. Our\nfindings also offer new insights to understanding and optimizing other\nreal-world network systems.\n", "  In his Comment, Els\\\"asser claims that the answer to my titular question is\none, not four as I have it. He goes on to give the singular principle that\nsupposedly captures the difference between a light-bulb and a laser:\n$g^{(2)}(\\tau=0)=1$. His claim is unconsidered and wrong, his proposed\nprinciple is impossible to apply and, when corrected, redundant (it then\nbecomes one of the four I list already), his arguments are manifestly\nmisdirected. My paper stands as is.\n", "  It is known that the cross-correlation function (CCF) of a partially coherent\nvortex (PCV) beam shows a robust link with the radial and azimuthal mode\nindices. However, the previous proposals are difficult to measure the CCF in\npractical system, especially in the case of astronomical objects. In this\nletter, we demonstrate experimentally that the Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect\ncan be used to measure the mode indices of the original vortex beam and\ninvestigate the relationship between the spatial coherent width and the\ncharacterization of CCF of a PCV beam. The technique we exploit is quite\nefficient and robust, and it may be useful in the field of free space\ncommunication and astronomy which are related to the photon's orbital angular\nmomentum.\n", "  We present a theoretical model to sufficiently investigate the optical\nrotational Doppler effect based on modal expansion method. We find that the\nfrequency shift content is only determined by the surface of spinning object\nand the reduced Doppler shift is linear to the difference of mode index between\ninput and output orbital angular momentum (OAM) light, and linear to the\nrotating speed of spinning object as well. An experiment is carried out to\nverify the theoretical model. We explicitly suggest that the spatial spiral\nphase distribution of spinning object determines the frequency content. The\ntheoretical model makes us better understand the physical processes of\nrotational Doppler effect, and thus has many related application fields, such\nas detection of rotating bodies, imaging of surface and measurement of OAM\nlight.\n", "  In this paper I present and critically discuss the main strategies that Bohr\nused and could have used to fend off the charge that his interpretation does\nnot provide a clear-cut distinction between the classical and the quantum\ndomain. In particular, in the first part of the paper I reassess the main\narguments used by Bohr to advocate the indispensability of a classical\nframework to refer to quantum phenomena. In this respect, by using a\ndistinction coming from an apparently unrelated philosophical corner, we could\nsay that Bohr is not a revisionist philosopher of physics but rather a\ndescriptivist one in the sense of Strawson. I will then go on discussing the\nnature of the holistic link between classical measurement apparatuses and\nobserved system that he also advocated. The oft-repeated conclusion that Bohr's\ninterpretation of the quantum formalism is untenable can only be established by\ngiving his arguments as much force as possible, which is what I will try to do\nin the following by remaining as faithful as possible to his published work.\n", "  We exploit the so called form-local subordination in the analysis of\nnon-symmetric perturbations of unbounded self-adjoint operators with isolated\nsimple positive eigenvalues. If the proper condition relating the size of gaps\nbetween the unperturbed eigenvalues and the strength of perturbation, measured\nby the form-local subordination, is satisfied, the root system of the perturbed\noperator contains a Riesz basis and usual asymptotic formulas for perturbed\neigenvalues and eigenvectors hold. The power of the abstract perturbation\nresults is demonstrated particularly on Schr\\\"odinger operators with possibly\nunbounded or singular complex potential perturbations.\n", "  Long period variables, among them Miras, are thought to be pulsating. Under\nthis approach the whole star inflates and deflates along a period that can vary\nfrom 100 to 900 days; that pulsation is assumed to produce shock waves on the\nouter layers of the star that propagate into the atmosphere and could account\nfor the increase in luminosity and the presence of emission lines in the\nspectra of these stars. However, this paradigm can seriously be questioned from\na theoretical point of view. First, in order to maintain a radial pulsation,\nthe spherical symmetry of the star must be preserved: how can it be reconciled\nwith the large convective cells present in these stars? or when close\ncompanions are detected? Secondly, how different radial and non-radial\npulsation modes of a sphere could be all damped except one radial mode? These\nproblems have no solution and significantly weigh on the pulsation paradigm.\nAcknowledging this inconsistency, we show that a close companion around these\nstars could account for the star variability. To support this assertion we\nstudy the observed light curves, their shapes at different wavelengths and\ntheir changes over time.\n", "  In this paper,we propose a four channel Dense Wavelength Division\nMultiplexing demultiplexer with two dimensional photonic crystal square\nresonant cavity that fulfill the ITU-T recommendation of G.694.1 DWDM\nsystems.DWDM demultiplexer consists of a waveguide and Microscopic Square\nResonant (MSR) cavity to enable filtering of the desired wavelength. The MSR\ncavity design has inner rods, outer rods and coupling rods. As the radius of\nthe inner rod in MSR cavity changes, the cavity has the ability to filter\ndifferent ITU.T G.6941 standard wavelengths like 1555.3 nm, 1555.5 nm, 1555.7\nnm, and 1555.9 nm with 0.2 nm / 25 GHz channel spacing. From the simulation of\nvarious wavelengths, helps achievement of the quality factor of 8000, uniform\nspectral linewidth of 0.2 nm, transmission efficiency of 100 %, crosstalk of\n-42 dB and footprint is about 395 micro meter square.\n", "  The neutral-kaon system constitutes a fantastic and unique laboratory for the\nstudy of CPT symmetry and the basic principles of quantum mechanics, and a\n$\\phi$-factory represents a unique opportunity to push forward these studies.\nThe experimental results show no deviation from the expectations of quantum\nmechanics and CPT symmetry, while the extreme precision of the measure- ments,\nin some cases, reaches the interesting Planck-scale region. At present the\nKLOE-2 experiment is collecting data with an upgraded detector with the aim of\nsignificantly improving these kinds of experimental tests.\n", "  We investigate the thickness and temperature dependence of a series of\nNi0:8Fe0:2/Ir0:2Mn0:8 bilayer samples with varying thickness ratio of the\nferromagnet/antiferromagnet (tFM/tAFM) in order to explore the exchange\ncoupling strengths in tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance (TAMR) devices.\nSpecific values of tFM/tAFM lead to four distinct scenarios with specific\nelectric responses to moderate magnetic fields. The characteristic dependence\nof the measured TAMR signal on applied voltage allows us to confirm its\npersistence up to room temperature despite an overlapped contribution by a\nthermal magnetic noise.\n", "  Asymmetric metal-dielectric nanostructures are demonstrated superior optical\nproperties arise from the combination of strong enhancement of their near\nfields and controllable scattering characteristics which originate from\nplasmonic and high-index dielectric components. Here, being inspired by the\nrecent experimental work [Dmitry~Zuev, \\textit{et al.}, Adv. Mater.\n\\textbf{28}, 3087 (2016)] on a new technique for fabrication of asymmetric\nhybrid nanoparticles via femtosecond laser melting at the nanoscale, we suggest\nand study numerically a novel type of hybrid dimer nanoantennas. The\nnanoantennas consist of asymmetric metal-dielectric (Au/Si) nanoparticles and\ncan allow tuning of the near- and far-field properties via laser melting of the\nmetal part. We demonstrate a modification of scattering properties, near\nelectric field distribution, normalized local density of states, and power\npatters of radiation of the nanoantennas upon laser reshaping. The parameters\nused to investigate these effects correspond to experimentally demonstrated\nvalues in the recent work.\n", "  In this work, we report optomechanical coupling, resolved sidebands and\nphonon lasing in a solid-core microbottle resonator fabricated on a single mode\noptical fiber. Mechanical modes with quality factors (Q_m) as high as 1.57*10^4\nand 1.45*10^4 were observed, respectively, at the mechanical frequencies\nf_m=33.7 MHz and f_m=58.9 MHz. The maximum f_m*Q_m~0.85*10^12 Hz is close to\nthe theoretical lower bound of 6*10^12 Hz needed to overcome thermal\ndecoherence for resolved-sideband cooling of mechanical motion at room\ntemperature, suggesting microbottle resonators as a possible platform for this\nendeavor. In addition to optomechanical effects, scatter-induced mode splitting\nand ringing phenomena, which are typical for high-quality optical resonances,\nwere also observed in a microbottle resonator.\n", "  We investigate MeV-GeV $\\gamma$-ray outbursts in 3C 273 in the frame of a\ntime-dependent one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model. In this model,\nelectrons are accelerated to extra-relativistic energy through the stochastic\nparticle acceleration and evolve with the time, nonthermal photons are produced\nby both synchrotron and inverse Compton scattering of synchrotron photons.\nMoreover, nonthermal photons during a quiescent are produced by the\nrelativistic electrons in the steady state and those during a outburst are\nproduced by the electrons whose injection rate is changed at some time\ninterval. We apply the model to two exceptionally luminous $\\gamma$-ray\noutbursts observed by the Fermi-LAT from 3C 273 in September, 2009 and obtain\nthe multi-wavelength spectra during the quiescent and during the outburst\nstates, respectively. Our results show that the time-dependent properties of\noutbursts can be reproduced by adopting the appropriate injection rate function\nof the electron population.\n", "  We present an ordinary case in the momentum diffusion equation for the\nelectron spectrum evolution and investigate the energy spectra and time\ndependent properties of flare in Mrk 421 in the frame of a time-dependent\none-zone synchrotron self-Compton model. In this model, electrons are\naccelerated to extra-relativistic energy through the strong magnetic turbulence\nand evolve with time, and non-thermal photons are produced by both synchrotron\nand inverse Comtpon scattering off synchrotron photons. Moreover, non-thermal\nphotons during a pre-flare are produced by the relativistic electrons in the\nsteady state and those during a flare are produced by the electrons whose\ninjection rate is changed during some time interval. We apply the model to the\nenergy spectra and time-dependent properties of flares in Mrk 421 by\nreproducing the pre-burst spectrum of the source and varying the injection rate\nin the Bohm diffusion (q=1) and the hard sphere approximation (q=2) case,\nrespectively. Our results show that Bohm diffusion case leads to hard photon\nspectra, and hard sphere case approximation seems to reproduce the energy\nspectra and the time dependent properties of flare still better.\n", "  Anomalies in online social networks can signify irregular, and often illegal\nbehaviour. Anomalies in online social networks can signify irregular, and often\nillegal behaviour. Detection of such anomalies has been used to identify\nmalicious individuals, including spammers, sexual predators, and online\nfraudsters. In this paper we survey existing computational techniques for\ndetecting anomalies in online social networks. We characterise anomalies as\nbeing either static or dynamic, and as being labelled or unlabelled, and survey\nmethods for detecting these different types of anomalies. We suggest that the\ndetection of anomalies in online social networks is composed of two\nsub-processes; the selection and calculation of network features, and the\nclassification of observations from this feature space. In addition, this paper\nprovides an overview of the types of problems that anomaly detection can\naddress and identifies key areas of future research.\n", "  We present an overview of the foundation, evolution, contributions and future\nprospects of the TEXONO Collaboration and its research programs on neutrino\nphysics and dark matter searches at the Kuo-Sheng Reactor Neutrino Laboratory\nin Taiwan and, as a founding partner of the CDEX program, at the China Jinping\nUnderground Laboratory in China.\n", "  Recent advances in large-scale synthesis of graphene and other 2D materials\nhave underscored the importance of local defects such as dislocations and grain\nboundaries (GBs), and especially their tendency to alter the electronic\nproperties of the material. Understanding how the polycrystalline morphology\naffects the electronic properties is crucial for the development of\napplications such as flexible electronics, energy harvesting devices or\nsensors. We here report on atomic scale characterization of several GBs and on\nthe structural-dependence of the localized electronic states in their vicinity.\nUsing low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy\n(STS), together with tight binding and ab initio numerical simulations we\nexplore GBs on the surface of graphite and elucidate the interconnection\nbetween the local density of states (LDOS) and their atomic structure. We show\nthat the electronic fingerprints of these GBs consist of pronounced resonances\nwhich, depending on the relative orientation of the adjacent crystallites,\nappear either on the electron side of the spectrum or as an electron-hole\nsymmetric doublet close to the charge neutrality point. These two types of\nspectral features will impact very differently the transport properties\nallowing, in the asymmetric case to introduce transport anisotropy which could\nbe utilized to design novel growth and fabrication strategies to control device\nperformance.\n", "  Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are significant contributors to the\nchemical enrichment of the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. It is\ntherefore essential to constrain the AGB contribution to the dust budget in\ngalaxies. Recent estimates of the total dust injection rate to the Large and\nSmall Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC; Riebel et al. 2012, Boyer et al. 2012,\nSrinivasan et al. in prep) have used data from the Spitzer Space Telescope SAGE\n(Surveying the Agents of Galaxy Evolution; Meixner et al. 2006) and SAGE-SMC\n(Gordon et al. 2011) surveys. When sorted by dust chemistry, the data allow for\na comparison of O-rich and carbonaceous dust-production rates. In the LMC, for\ninstance, the rate of dust production from carbon stars is about two and a half\ntimes that from oxygen-rich AGBs. A reliable determination of the fractional\ncontributions of the two types of dust would serve as input to models of\nchemical evolution. However, the Spitzer IRAC photometric bands do not\nsufficiently probe the characteristic mid-infrared spectral features that can\ndistinguish O-rich AGBs from carbon stars - namely, the 9.7 $\\mu$m silicate\nfeature and the 11.3 $\\mu$m silicon carbide feature. With the continuous\nspectral coverage in the 4-30 $\\mu$m range, SPICA has the potential to\ndistinguish these two types of chemistries. In this contribution, synthetic\nphotometry from the model grid of AGB stars, GRAMS (Sargent et al. 2011;\nSrinivasan et al. 2011) will be used to discuss the science possibilities that\nSPICA might offer this study.\n", "  Students who successfully engage in self-regulated learning, are able to plan\ntheir own studying, monitoring their progress and make any necessary\nadjustments based upon the data and feedback they gather. In order to promote\nthis type of independent learning, a recent introductory mechanics course was\nmodified such that the homework and tests emphasized the planning, monitoring\nand adjusting of self-regulated learning. Students were able to choose many of\ntheir own out-of-class learning activities. Rather than collecting daily or\nweekly problem set solutions, assignments were mostly progress reports where\nstudents reported which activities they had attempted, self-assessment of their\nprogress and plans for their next study session. Tests included wrappers where\nstudents were asked to reflect on their mistakes and plans for improvement.\nWhile many students only engaged superficially the independent aspects of the\ncourse, some did demonstrate evidence of self-regulation. Despite this lack of\nengagement, students performed as well as comparable student populations on\ncourse exam and better on the Force Concept Inventory.\n", "  Density-functional theory is a formally exact description of a many-body\nquantum system in terms of its density; in practice, however, approximations to\nthe universal density functional are required. In this work, a model based on\ndeep learning is developed to approximate this functional. Deep learning allows\ncomputational models that are capable of naturally discovering intricate\nstructure in large and/or high-dimensional data sets, with multiple levels of\nabstraction. As no assumptions are made as to the form of this structure, this\napproach is much more powerful and flexible than traditional approaches. As an\nexample application, the model is shown to perform well on approximating the\nkinetic-energy density functional for noninteracting electrons. The model is\nanalyzed in detail, and its advantages over conventional machine learning are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Few layer phosphorene(FLP) devices are extensively studied due to its unique\nelectronic properties and potential applications on nano-electronics . Here we\npresent magnetotransport studies which reveal electron-electron interactions as\nthe dominant scattering mechanism in hexagonal boron nitride-encapsulated FLP\ndevices. From weak localization measurements, we estimate the electron\ndephasing length to be 30 to 100 nm at low temperatures, which exhibits a\nstrong dependence on carrier density n and a power-law dependence on\ntemperature (~T-0.4). These results establish that the dominant scattering\nmechanism in FLP is electron-electron interactions.\n", "  Thermoelectric (TE) devices have been attracting increasing attention because\nof their ability to convert heat directly to electricity. To date, improving\nthe TE figure of merit remains the key challenge. The advent of the topological\ninsulator and the emerging nanotechnology open a new way to design\nhigh-performance TE devices. In this paper, we investigate the TE transport\nproperties of the Bi2Se3 thin film by the first-principle calculations and the\nBoltzmann transport theory. By comparing our calculations with the earlier\nexperimental data, we demonstrate that, for the Bi2Se3 film of thickness larger\nthan six quintuple layers, the relaxation time of the topological surface\nstates in the bulk gap is about hundreds of femtoseconds, which is about two\norders larger than that of the bulk states. Such a large relaxation-time\ndifference causes the ratio of the electrical conductance to the thermal\nconductance much larger than the value predicted by the Wiedemann-Franz law, as\nwell as the large magnitude of Seebeck coefficient, and consequently the large\nTE figure of merit, when the Fermi level is near the conduction band edge. We\nshows that the TE performance can be further improved by introducing defects in\nthe middle layers of the thin film. The improvement is generally significant at\nroom temperature and can be further enhanced at higher temperature.\n", "  High harmonic generation (HHG) is an established means of producing coherent,\nshort wavelength, ultrafast pulses from a compact set-up. Table-top\nhigh-harmonic sources are increasingly being used to image physical and\nbiological systems using emerging techniques such as coherent diffraction\nimaging and ptychography. These novel imaging methods require coherent\nillumination, and it is therefore important to both characterize the spatial\ncoherence of high-harmonic beams and understand the processes which limit this\nproperty. Here we investigate the near- and far-field spatial properties of\nhigh-harmonic radiation generated in a gas cell. The variation with harmonic\norder of the intensity profile, wavefront curvature, and complex coherence\nfactor is measured in the far-field by the SCIMITAR technique. Using the\nGaussian-Schell model, the properties of the harmonic beam in the plane of\ngeneration are deduced. Our results show that the order-dependence of the\nharmonic spatial coherence is consistent with partial coherence induced by both\nvariation of the intensity-dependent dipole phase as well as finite spatial\ncoherence of the driving radiation. These findings are used to suggest ways in\nwhich the coherence of harmonic beams could be increased further, which would\nhave direct benefits to imaging with high-harmonic radiation.\n", "  Drawing fair samples from the Boltzmann distribution of a statistical model\nis a challenging task for modern digital computers. We propose a physical\nimplementation of a Boltzmann sampler for the classical XY model by using a\nlaser network. The XY spins are mapped onto the phases of multiple laser pulses\nin a fiber ring cavity and the steady-state distribution of phases naturally\nrealizes the Boltzmann distribution of the corresponding XY model. We\nexperimentally implement the laser network by using an actively mode-locked\nfiber laser with optical delay lines, and demonstrate Boltzmann sampling for a\none-dimensional XY ring.\n", "  We perform a Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) modeling of the projected\ntwo-point correlation function (2PCF) of quasars that are observed in the\nWide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) telescope with counter-parts in the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release (DR)-8 quasar catalog at a median\nredshift of $z\\sim 1.04 (\\pm 0.58)$. Using a four parameter HOD model we derive\nthe host mass scales of WISE selected quasars. Our results show that the median\nhalo masses of central and satellite quasars lie in the range $M_{\\mathrm{cen}}\n= (5 \\pm 1.0) \\times 10^{12} M_{\\odot}$ and $M_{\\mathrm{sat}} = 8 (^{+7.8}\n_{-4.8}) \\times 10^{13} M_{\\odot}$, respectively. The derived satellite\nfraction is $f_{\\mathrm{sat}}= 5.5 (^{+35} _{-5.0})\\times 10^{-3}$. Previously\nRichardson et al.\\ used the SDSS DR7 quasar clustering data to obtain the halo\nmass distributions of $z\\sim 1.4$ quasars. Our results on the HOD of central\nquasars are in excellent agreement with Richardson et al.\\ but the host mass\nscale of satellite quasars for the WISE sample, is lower than that of\nRichardson et al.\\ resulting in an order of magnitude higher satellite fraction\nfor the WISE sample. We note that our sample of quasars are systematically\nbrighter in the WISE frequency bands compared to the full quasar sample of\nSDSS. We discuss the implication of this result in the context of current\ntheories of galaxy evolution.\n", "  In linear optics, photons are scattered in a network through passive optical\nelements including beamsplitters and phase shifters, leading to many intriguing\napplications in physics, such as Mach-Zehnder interferometry, Hong-Ou-Mandel\neffect, and tests of fundamental quantum mechanics. Here we present a general\nanalytic expression governing the upper limit of the transition amplitudes in\nsampling bosons, through all realizable linear optics. Apart from boson\nsampling, this transition bound results in many other interesting applications,\nincluding behaviors of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC) in optical networks,\ncounterparts of Hong-Ou-Mandel effects for multiple photons, and approximating\npermanents of matrices. Also, this general bound implies the existence of a\npolynomial-time randomized algorithm for estimating transition amplitudes of\nbosons, which represents a solution to an open problem raised by Aaronson and\nHance in 2012.\n", "  We demonstrate a technique for producing a cold pulsed beam of atoms by\ntransferring a cloud of atoms trapped in a three dimensional magneto-optic trap\n(MOT). The MOT is loaded by heating a getter source of Rb atoms. We show that\nit is advantageous to transfer with two beams (with a small angle between them)\ncompared to a single beam, because the atoms stop interacting with the beams in\nthe two-beam technique, which results in a Gaussian velocity distribution. The\natoms are further cooled in optical molasses by turning off the MOT magnetic\nfield before the transfer beams are turned on.\n", "  We study new types of Josephson junctions composed of helical $p$-wave\nsuperconductors with $k_{x}\\hat{x}\\pm k_{y}\\hat{y}$ and $k_{y}\\hat{x}\\pm\nk_{x}\\hat{y}$-pairing symmetries using quasiclassical Green's functions with\nthe generalized Riccati parametrization. The junctions can host rich ground\nstates: $\\pi$ phase, $0+\\pi$ phase, $\\varphi_{0}$ phase and $\\varphi$ phase.\nThe phase transition can be tuned by rotating the magnetization in the\nferromagnetic interface. We present the phase diagrams in the parameter space\nformed by the orientation of the magnetization or by the magnitude of the\ninterfacial potentials. The selection rules for the lowest order current which\nare responsible for the formation of the rich phases are summarized from the\ncurrent-phase relations based on the numerical calculation. We construct a\nGinzburg-Landau type of free energy for the junctions with ${\\bf{d}}$-vectors\nand the magnetization, which not only reveals the interaction forms of\nspin-triplet superconductivity and ferromagnetism but also can directly leads\nto the selection rules. In addition, the energies of the Andreev bound states\nand the novel symmetries in the current-phase relations are also investigated.\nOur results are helpful both in the prediction of the novel Josephson phases\nand in the design of the quantum circuits.\n", "  Polynomial--time constant--space quantum Turing machines (QTMs) and\nlogarithmic--space probabilistic Turing machines (PTMs) recognize uncountably\nmany languages with bounded error (Say and Yakary\\i lmaz 2014,\narXiv:1411.7647). In this paper, we investigate more restricted cases for both\nmodels to recognize uncountably many languages with bounded error. We show that\ndouble logarithmic space is enough for PTMs on unary languages in sweeping\nreading mode or logarithmic space for one-way head. On unary languages, for\nquantum models, we obtain middle logarithmic space for counter machines. For\nbinary languages, arbitrary small non-constant space is enough for PTMs even\nusing only counter as memory. For counter machines, when restricted to\npolynomial time, we can obtain the same result for linear space. For\nconstant--space QTMs, we follow the result for a restricted sweeping head,\nknown as restarting realtime.\n", "  Due to its coherence properties and high optical depth, a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate provides an ideal setting to investigate collective atom-light\ninteractions. Superradiant light scattering in a Bose-Einstein condensate is a\nfascinating example of such an interaction. It is an analogous process to Dicke\nsuperradiance, in which an electronically inverted sample decays collectively,\nleading to the emission of one or more light pulses in a well-defined\ndirection. Through time-resolved measurements of the superradiant light pulses\nemitted by an end-pumped BEC, we study the close connection of superradiant\nlight scattering with Dicke superradiance. A 1D model of the system yields good\nagreement with the experimental data and shows that the dynamics results from\nthe structures that build up in the light and matter-wave fields along the BEC.\nThis paves the way for exploiting the atom-photon correlations generated by the\nsuperradiance.\n", "  Quantum information science breaks limitations of conventional information\ntransfer, cryptography and computation by using quantum superpositions or\nentanglement as resources for information processing. Here, we report on the\nexperimental realization of three-party quantum communication protocols using\nsingle three-level quantum system (qutrit) communication: secret sharing,\ndetectable Byzantine agreement, and communication complexity reduction for a\nthree-valued function. We have implemented these three schemes using the same\noptical fiber interferometric setup. Our realization is easily scalable without\nsacrificing detection efficiency or generating extremely complex many-particle\nentangled states.\n", "  We consider a family $\\{\\Omega^\\varepsilon\\}_{\\varepsilon>0}$ of periodic\ndomains in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with waveguide geometry and analyse spectral\nproperties of the Neumann Laplacian $-\\Delta_{\\Omega^\\varepsilon}$ on\n$\\Omega^\\varepsilon$. The waveguide $\\Omega^\\varepsilon$ is a union of a thin\nstraight strip of the width $\\varepsilon$ and a family of small protuberances\nwith the so-called \"room-and-passage\" geometry. The protuberances are attached\nperiodically, with a period $\\varepsilon$, along the strip upper boundary. For\n$\\varepsilon\\to 0$ we prove a (kind of) resolvent convergence of\n$-\\Delta_{\\Omega^\\varepsilon}$ to a certain ordinary differential operator.\nAlso we demonstrate Hausdorff convergence of the spectrum. In particular, we\nconclude that if the sizes of \"passages\" are appropriately scaled the first\nspectral gap of $-\\Delta_{\\Omega^\\varepsilon}$ is determined exclusively by\ngeometric properties of the protuberances. The proofs are carried out using\nmethods of homogenization theory.\n", "  After centuries, the long-standing problem of the nature of ball lightning\nmay be closer to a solution. The relativistic-microwave theory of ball\nlightning recently proposed by Wu accounts for many of the leading\ncharacteristics of ball lightning, which most previous theories have failed to\ndo. It involves the impact of a lightning-caused relativistic electron bunch to\nsoil, producing an EM pulse that forms a plasma bubble. While the theory\npresents a plausible account of ball-lightning formation, storing\nelectromagnetic energy long enough to account for the observed lifetime of such\nobjects was not demonstrated. Here we show how such a structure can develop the\nhigh Q factor (~10^10) needed for the observed lifetimes of ~seconds for ball\nlightning, and show that the structure is radially stable, given certain\nassumptions.\n", "  The experimental realization of stable, ultracold Fermi gases near a Feshbach\nresonance allows to study gases with attractive interactions of essentially\narbitrary strength. They extend the classic paradigm of BCS into a regime which\nhas never been accessible before. We review the theoretical concepts which have\nbeen developed in this context, including the Tan relations and the notion of\nfixed points at zero density, which are at the origin of universality. We\ndiscuss in detail the universal thermodynamics of the unitary Fermi gas which\nallows a fit free comparison between theory and experiment for this strongly\ninteracting system. In addition, we adress the consequences of scale invariance\nat infinite scattering length and the subtle violation of scale invariance in\ntwo dimensions. Finally we discuss the Fermionic excitation spectrum accessible\nin momentum resolved RF-spectroscopy and the origin of universal lower bounds\nfor the shear viscosity and the spin diffusion constant.\n", "  Policy makers, urban planners, architects, sociologists, and economists are\ninterested in creating urban areas that are both lively and safe. But are the\nsafety and liveliness of neighborhoods independent characteristics? Or are they\njust two sides of the same coin? In a world where people avoid unsafe looking\nplaces, neighborhoods that look unsafe will be less lively, and will fail to\nharness the natural surveillance of human activity. But in a world where the\npreference for safe looking neighborhoods is small, the connection between the\nperception of safety and liveliness will be either weak or nonexistent. In this\npaper we explore the connection between the levels of activity and the\nperception of safety of neighborhoods in two major Italian cities by combining\nmobile phone data (as a proxy for activity or liveliness) with scores of\nperceived safety estimated using a Convolutional Neural Network trained on a\ndataset of Google Street View images scored using a crowdsourced visual\nperception survey. We find that: (i) safer looking neighborhoods are more\nactive than what is expected from their population density, employee density,\nand distance to the city centre; and (ii) that the correlation between\nappearance of safety and activity is positive, strong, and significant, for\nfemales and people over 50, but negative for people under 30, suggesting that\nthe behavioral impact of perception depends on the demographic of the\npopulation. Finally, we use occlusion techniques to identify the urban features\nthat contribute to the appearance of safety, finding that greenery and street\nfacing windows contribute to a positive appearance of safety (in agreement with\nOscar Newman's defensible space theory). These results suggest that urban\nappearance modulates levels of human activity and, consequently, a\nneighborhood's rate of natural surveillance.\n", "  In this letter, we apply the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model, a scenario based on\ncompactifications, to control the UV divergence of the zero-point energy\ndensity equation for the vacuum fluctuations, which has been unsuccessfully\naddressed to the cosmological constant (CC) due to a heavy discrepancy between\ntheory and observation. Historically, the problem of CC has been shelved in the\nRS point of view, having few or non literature on the subject. In this sense\nand as done with the hierarchy problem, we apply the RS model to solve this\ndifference via extra dimensions; we also describe how brane effects could be\nthe solution to this substantial difference. It should be noticed that this\nproblem is studied assuming first Minkoswki type branes, and then followed by\ncosmologically more realistic FLRW type branes. We finally find some remarkably\ninteresting consequences in the RS scenario: The CC problem can be solved via\ncompactification of the extra dimension and the compactification radius turns\nout to be approximately twice the one used to solve the hierarchy problem in\nthe $\\beta\\pi r$ factor by Randall and Sundrum, suggesting that this subtle\ndifference in both problems could be caused by corrections that comes from\nquantum gravity effects. We also estimate the corresponding scale where,\naccording to this results, we should begin to notice subtle deviations to the\ninverse square law of gravitation due to the presence of the extra dimension.\n", "  Perfect state transfer between two marked vertices of a graph by means of\ndiscrete-time quantum walk is analyzed. We consider the quantum walk search\nalgorithm with two marked vertices, sender and receiver. It is shown by\nexplicit calculation that for the coined quantum walks on star graph and\ncomplete graph with self-loops perfect state transfer between the sender and\nreceiver vertex is achieved for arbitrary number of vertices $N$ in\n$O(\\sqrt{N})$ steps of the walk. Finally, we show that Szegedy's walk with\nqueries on complete graph allows for state transfer with unit fidelity in the\nlimit of large $N$.\n", "  The isolation of a growing number of two-dimensional (2D) materials has\ninspired worldwide efforts to integrate distinct 2D materials into van der\nWaals (vdW) heterostructures. Given that any passivated, dangling bond-free\nsurface will interact with another via vdW forces, the vdW heterostructure\nconcept can be extended to include the integration of 2D materials with non-2D\nmaterials that adhere primarily through noncovalent interactions. In this\nreview, we present a succinct and critical survey of emerging mixed-dimensional\n(2D + nD, where n is 0, 1 or 3) heterostructure devices. By comparing and\ncontrasting with all-2D vdW heterostructures as well as with competing\nconventional technologies, the challenges and opportunities for\nmixed-dimensional vdW heterostructures are highlighted.\n", "  The dispersion relation of kinetic Alfv\\'en wave in inertial regime is\nstudied in a three component non-degenerate streaming plasma. A lin- ear\ndispersion relation using fluid- Vlasov equation for quantum plasma is also\nderived. The quantum correction CQ raised due to the insertion of Bohm\npotential in Vlasov model causes the suppression in the Alfven wave frequency\nand the growth rates of instability. A number of analytical expressions are\nderived for various modes of propagation. It is also found that many system\nparameters, i.e, streaming velocity, dust charge, num- ber density and quantum\ncorrection significantly influence the dispersion relation and the growth rate\nof instability.\n", "  An alternative to the postulate of dark energy required to explain the\naccelerated expansion of the universe is to adopt an inhomogeneous cosmological\nmodel to explain the supernovae data without dark energy. We adopt a void\ncosmology model, based on the inhomogeneous Lema\\^{i}tre-Tolman-Bondi solution\nof Einstein's field equations. The model can resolve observational anomalies in\nthe $\\Lambda CDM$ model, such as the discrepancy between the locally measured\nvalue of the Hubble constant, $H_0=73.24\\pm 1.74\\,{\\rm km}\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}\\,{\\rm\nMpc}^{-1}$, and the $H_0=66.93\\pm 0.62\\,{\\rm km}\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$\ndetermined by the Planck satellite data and the $\\Lambda CDM$ model, and the\nlithium $^{7}{\\rm Li}$ problem, which is a $5\\sigma$ mismatch between the\ntheoretical prediction for the $^{7}{\\rm Li}$ from big bang nucleosynthesis and\nthe value that we observe locally today at $z=0$. The void model can also\nresolve the tension between the number of massive clusters derived from the\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich effect by the Planck satellite and the number expected from\nthe CMB anisotropies, and the CMB weak lensing anomaly observed in the Planck\ndata. The cosmological Copernican principle and the time and position today\ncoincidence conundrums in the $\\Lambda CDM$ and void cosmological models are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) is a powerful tool widely used in\nengineering community. It is based on identification of a physical\ncontradiction in a problem, and based on the corresponding pair of\ncontradicting parameters selecting a few of suitable inventive principles,\nnarrowing down the choice and leading to a much faster solution of a problem.\nIt is remarkable that TRIZ methodology can also be applied to scientific\ndisciplines. Many of TRIZ inventive principles can be post factum identified in\nvarious in scientific inventions and discoveries. However, additional inventive\nprinciples, more suitable for scientific disciplines, should be introduced and\nadded to standard TRIZ, and some of the standard inventive principles need to\nbe reformulated to be better applicable to science - we call this extension\nAccelerating Science TRIZ. In this short note we describe and illustrate the\nAS-TRIZ inventive principles via scientific examples, identifying AS-TRIZ\ninventive principles in discoveries and inventions originated from physics,\nbiology, and other areas. This brief note, we believe, is yet one more step\ntowards bringing TRIZ methodology closer into the scientific community.\n", "  We made an interferometric Michelson type setup and a simple holographic\nsetup to demonstrate the feasibility of interferometric and holographic\ntechniques by means of a diode laser. The laser was made by using a common\ndiode available as a penlight element (less than R$ 15,00 value) and a simple\nstabilized 110 VCA- 3 VCC power supply. Interference fringes and holograms of\nsmall objects where obtained very similar to those of a helium-neon laser based\nsetup.\n", "  The submicron- and micron-scale structures of composite hydrogels based on\nbacterial cellulose (BC) and polyacrylamide were studied by spin-echo\nsmall-angle neutron scattering (SESANS). These hydrogels were synthesized via\nfree-radical polymerization of acrylamide carried out in pellicle of BC swollen\nin the reaction solution. No neutron scattering was observed for the samples\nswollen in heavy water to the equilibrium state, but a SESANS signal appeared\nwhen TbCl$_{3}$ salt was added to the solvent. The SESANS dependences obtained\nfor these samples revealed the anisotropy of mesostructure for the hydrogels\nunder investigation. Density inhomogeneities on the characteristic scale of\n11.5 $\\pm$ 0.5 $\\mu$m were detected in one specific orientation of the sample,\ni.e. with growth plane of BC parallel to plane formed by neutron beam and\nspin-echo length. The uniaxial anisotropy revealed agrees with the proposed\nmodel, which attributes this behavior to the existence of the tunnel-like\noriented structures inside BC.\n", "  In this paper we discuss the so called \"quantum omelette\" created by Bohr and\nHeisenberg through the mix of (ontic) objective accounts and (epistemic)\nsubjective ones within the analysis of Quantum Mechanics (QM). We will begin by\naddressing the difficult relation between ontology and epistemology within the\nhistory of both physics and philosophy. We will then argue that the present\n\"quantum omelette\" is being presently cooked in two opposite directions: the\nfirst scrambling ontological problems with epistemological solutions and the\nsecond scrambling epistemic approaches with ontological questions. A good\nexample of the former is a new type of argumentation strategy attempting to\njustify the use of decoherence, namely, the \"For All Practical Purposes\"\n(shortly known as FAPP) type of justification. We will argue that 'FAPP-type\nsolutions' remain, at best, epistemological answers which not only escape the\nontological questions at stake -regarding the quantum to classical limit- but\nalso turn the original problem completely meaningless. The latter omelette can\nbe witnessed in relation to some criticisms raised against the epistemic\nBayesian approach to QM (shortly known as QBism). We will argue that QBists\nhave produced a consistent scheme that might allow us to begin to unscramble\n-at least part of- the \"quantum omelette\". In this respect, we will show why\nthe epistemic QBist approach is safe from several (ontological) criticisms it\nhas recently received (see [42, 47, 48]). We end our paper with a discussion\nabout the importance of ontological approaches within foundations of QM.\n"]}
