A new argument in favor of a stable scenario\nfor space dimensionality for a time scale longer than that required for the\nexistence of human or another kind of highly-evolved life on Earth is proposed.\n", "  In this article it is shown that a careful analysis of Kant's \"Thoughts on\nthe True Estimation of Living Forces\" leads to a conclusion that does not match\nthe usually accepted interpretation of Kant's reasoning in 1747, according to\nwhich the Young Kant supposedly establishes a relationship between the\ntridimensionality of space and Newton's law of universal gravitation. Indeed,\nit is argued that this text does not yield a satisfactory explanation of space\ndimensionality, actually restricting itself to justify the tridimensionality of\nextension.\n", "  By applying an idea of Borodin and Olshanski [J. Algebra 313 (2007), 40-60],\nwe study various scaling limits of determinantal point processes with trace\nclass projection kernels given by spectral projections of selfadjoint\nSturm-Liouville operators. Instead of studying the convergence of the kernels\nas functions, the method directly addresses the strong convergence of the\ninduced integral operators. We show that, for this notion of convergence, the\nDyson, Airy, and Bessel kernels are universal in the bulk, soft-edge, and\nhard-edge scaling limits. This result allows us to give a short and unified\nderivation of the known formulae for the scaling limits of the classical random\nmatrix ensembles with unitary invariance, that is, the Gaussian unitary\nensemble (GUE), the Wishart or Laguerre unitary ensemble (LUE), and the MANOVA\n(multivariate analysis of variance) or Jacobi unitary ensemble (JUE).\n", "  We consider tubular neighborhood of an arbitrary submanifold embedded in a\n(pseudo-)Riemannian manifold. This can be described by Fermi normal coordinates\n(FNC) satisfying certain conditions as described by Florides and Synge in\n\\cite{FS}. By generalizing the work of Muller {\\it et al} in \\cite{muller} on\nRiemann normal coordinate expansion, we derive all order FNC expansion of\nvielbein in this neighborhood with closed form expressions for the curvature\nexpansion coefficients. Our result is shown to be consistent with certain\nintegral theorem for the metric proved in \\cite{FS}.\n", "  In this work we classify the fifth-order integrable symmetrically coup led\nsystems of weight 0 that possess seventh-order symmetry. we obtained 2 new\nintegrable systems that related bi-Hamiltonian formulations are constructed\ntoo.\n", "  The effects on the non-relativistic dynamics of a system compound by two\nelectrons interacting by a Coulomb potential and with an external harmonic\noscillator potential, confined to move in a two dimensional Euclidean space,\nare investigated. In particular, it is shown that it is possible to determine\nexactly and in a closed form a finite portion of the energy spectrum and the\nassociated eigeinfunctions for the Schr\\\"odinger equation describing the\nrelative motion of the electrons, by putting it into the form of a biconfluent\nHeun equation. In the same framework, another set of solutions of this type can\nbe straightforwardly obtained for the case when the two electrons are submitted\nalso to an external constant magnetic field.\n", "  Glass-forming liquids grow dramatically sluggish upon cooling. This slowdown\nhas long been thought to be accompanied by a growing correlation length.\nCharacteristic dynamical and static length scales, however, have been observed\nto grow at different rates, which perplexes the relationship between the two\nand with the slowdown. Here, we show the existence of a direct link between\ndynamical sluggishness and static point-to-set correlations, holding at the\nlocal level as we probe different environments within a liquid. This link,\nwhich is stronger and more general than that observed with locally preferred\nstructures, suggests the existence of an intimate relationship between\nstructure and dynamics in a broader range of glass-forming liquids than\npreviously thought.\n", "  Oscillating shapes of the primordial bispectrum are present in many\ninflationary models. The Planck experiment has recently published measurements\nof oscillating shapes, which were however limited to the efficient frequency\nrange of the used analysis method. Here we study the KSW estimator for\noscillations in the CMB bispectrum, that allows to examine arbitrary\noscillation frequencies for separable oscillating bispectrum shapes. We study\nthe precision with which amplitude, phase and frequency can be determined with\nour estimator. An examination of the 3-point function in real space gives\nfurther insight into the estimator.\n", "  We present a chrono-cosmography project, aiming at the inference of the four\ndimensional formation history of the observed large scale structure from its\norigin to the present epoch. To do so, we perform a full-scale Bayesian\nanalysis of the northern galactic cap of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\nData Release 7 main galaxy sample, relying on a fully probabilistic, physical\nmodel of the non-linearly evolved density field. Besides inferring initial\nconditions from observations, our methodology naturally and accurately\nreconstructs non-linear features at the present epoch, such as walls and\nfilaments, corresponding to high-order correlation functions generated by\nlate-time structure formation. Our inference framework self-consistently\naccounts for typical observational systematic and statistical uncertainties\nsuch as noise, survey geometry and selection effects. We further account for\nluminosity dependent galaxy biases and automatic noise calibration within a\nfully Bayesian approach. As a result, this analysis provides highly-detailed\nand accurate reconstructions of the present density field on scales larger than\n$\\sim~3$ Mpc$/h$, constrained by SDSS observations. This approach also leads to\nthe first quantitative inference of plausible formation histories of the\ndynamic large scale structure underlying the observed galaxy distribution. The\nresults described in this work constitute the first full Bayesian non-linear\nanalysis of the cosmic large scale structure with the demonstrated capability\nof uncertainty quantification. Some of these results will be made publicly\navailable along with this work. The level of detail of inferred results and the\nhigh degree of control on observational uncertainties pave the path towards\nhigh precision chrono-cosmography, the subject of simultaneously studying the\ndynamics and the morphology of the inhomogeneous Universe.\n", "  The relativistic hydrogen atom in an Euclidean space-time of arbitrary number\nof space dimensions ($D$) plus one time dimension is revisited. In particular,\nnumerical solutions of the radial Dirac equation for a generalized Coulombian\npotential proportional to $1/r^{(D-2)}$ are investigated. It is argued that one\ncould not find any physical solution for $D\\geq 4$.\n", "  Some time ago has been studied mathematical models for biogas production due\nto its importance in the use of control and optimization of re\\-new\\-able\nresources and clean energy. In this paper we combine two algebraic methods to\nobtain solutions of Abel equation of first kind that arise from a mathematical\nmodel to biogas production formulated in France on 2001. The aim of this paper\nis obtain Liouvillian solutions of Abel's equations through Hamiltonian\nAlgebrization. As an illustration, we present graphics of solutions for Abel\nequations and solutions for algebrized Abel equations.\n", "  We report the results of the first study of the multi-stream environment of\ndark matter haloes in cosmological N-body simulations in the LCDM cosmology.\nThe full dynamical state of dark matter can be described as a three-dimensional\nsub-manifold in six dimensional phase space - the dark matter sheet. In our\nstudy we use a Lagrangian sub-manifold x = x(q,t) (where x and q are co-moving\nEulerian and Lagrangian coordinates respectively), which is dynamically\nequivalent to the dark matter sheet but is more convenient for numerical\nanalysis. Our major results can be summarized as follows. At the resolution of\nthe simulation i.e. without additional smoothing, the cosmic web represents a\nhierarchical structure: each halo is embedded in the filamentary framework of\nthe web predominantly at the filament crossings, and each filament is embedded\nin the wall like fabric of the web at the wall crossings. Locally, each halo or\nsub-halo is a peak in the number of streams field. The number of streams in the\nneighbouring filaments is higher than in the neighbouring walls. The walls are\nregions where number of streams is equal to three or a few. Voids are uniquely\ndefined by the local condition requiring to be a single-stream flow region. The\nshells of streams around haloes are quite thin and the closest void region is\ntypically within one and a half FOF radius from the center of the halo.\n", "  We consider the possibility of new physics giving rise to effective\ninteractions of the form $e^+e^-Hf \\bar f$, where $f$ represents a charged\nlepton $\\ell$ or a (light) quark $q$, and $H$ the recently discovered Higgs\nboson. Such vertices would give contributions beyond the standard model to the\nHiggs production processes $e^+e^- \\to H\\ell^+\\ell^-$ and $e^+e^- \\to H q \\bar\nq$ at a future $e^+e^-$ collider. We write the most general form for these\nvertices allowed by Lorentz symmetry. Assuming that such interactions\ncontribute in addition to the standard model production processes, where the\nfinal-state fermion pair comes from the decay of the $Z$ boson, we obtain the\ndifferential cross section for the processes $e^+e^- \\to H\\ell^+\\ell^-$ and\n$e^+e^- \\to Hq\\bar q$ to linear order in the effective interactions. We propose\nseveral observables with differing CP and T properties which, if measured, can\nbe used to constrain the couplings occurring in interaction vertices. We derive\npossible limits on these couplings that may be obtained at a collider with\ncentre-of-mass energy of 500 GeV and an integrated luminosity of 500 fb$^{-1}$.\nWe also carry out the analysis assuming that both the electron and positron\nbeams can be longitudinally polarized, and find that the sensitivity to the\ncouplings can be improved by a factor of 2-4 by a specific choice of the signs\nof the polarizations of both the electron and positron beams for the same\nintegrated luminosity.\n", "  We obtain the conditions for the emergence of the swarm intelligence effect\nin an interactive game of restless multi-armed bandit (rMAB). A player competes\nwith multiple agents. Each bandit has a payoff that changes with a probability\n$p_{c}$ per round. The agents and player choose one of three options: (1)\nExploit (a good bandit), (2) Innovate (asocial learning for a good bandit among\n$n_{I}$ randomly chosen bandits), and (3) Observe (social learning for a good\nbandit). Each agent has two parameters $(c,p_{obs})$ to specify the decision:\n(i) $c$, the threshold value for Exploit, and (ii) $p_{obs}$, the probability\nfor Observe in learning. The parameters $(c,p_{obs})$ are uniformly\ndistributed. We determine the optimal strategies for the player using complete\nknowledge about the rMAB. We show whether or not social or asocial learning is\nmore optimal in the $(p_{c},n_{I})$ space and define the swarm intelligence\neffect. We conduct a laboratory experiment (67 subjects) and observe the swarm\nintelligence effect only if $(p_{c},n_{I})$ are chosen so that social learning\nis far more optimal than asocial learning.\n", "  Recently, we proposed a method that converts the force between two-large\ncolloids into the pressure on the surface element (FPSE conversion) in a system\nof a colloidal solution. Using it, the density distribution of the small\ncolloids around the large colloid is calculated. In a similar manner, in this\nletter, we propose a transform theory for colloidal probe atomic force\nmicroscopy (colloidal probe AFM), which transforms the force acting on the\ncolloidal probe into the density distribution of the small colloids on a flat\nsurface. If measured condition is proper one, in our view, it is possible for\nthe transform theory to be applied for liquid AFM and obtain the liquid\nstructure. The transform theory we derived is briefly explained in this letter.\n", "  After the successful completion of the SIDDHARTA experiment run with crab\nwaist collisions, the electron- positron collider DA{\\Phi}NE has started\nroutine operations for the KLOE-2 detector. The new interaction region also\nexploits the crab waist collision scheme, but features certain complications\nincluding the experimental detector solenoid, compensating anti-solenoids, and\ntilted quadrupole magnets. We have performed simulations of the beam-beam\ncollisions in the collider taking into account the real DA{\\Phi}NE nonlinear\nlattice. In particular, we have evaluated the effect of crab waist sextupoles\nand beam-beam interactions on the DA{\\Phi}NE dynamical aperture and energy\nacceptance, and estimated the luminosity that can be potentially achieved with\nand without crab waist sextupoles in the present working conditions. A\nnumerical analysis has been performed in order to propose possible steps for\nfurther luminosity increase in DA{\\Phi}NE such as a better working point\nchoice, crab sextupole strength optimization, correction of the phase advance\nbetween the sextupoles and the interaction region. The proposed change of the\ne- ring working point was implemented and resulted in a significant performance\nincrease.\n", "  We calculate tree level scattering amplitudes for open strings using the NSR\nformalism. We present a streamlined symmetry-based and pedagogical approach to\nthe computations, which we first develop by checking two-, three-, and\nfour-point functions involving bosons and fermions. We calculate the five-point\namplitude for massless gluons and find agreement with an earlier result by\nBrandt, Machado and Medina. We then compute the five-point amplitudes involving\ntwo and four fermions respectively, the general form of which has not been\npreviously obtained in the NSR formalism. The results nicely confirm\nexpectations from the supersymmetric $F^4$ effective action. Finally we use the\nprescription of Kawai, Lewellen and Tye (KLT) to compute the amplitudes for the\nclosed string sector.\n", "  In this paper, we study the Universal Blind Quantum Computing (UBQC)\nprotocol, which allows a client to perform quantum computation on a remote\nquantum server and the Remote Blind qubit state Preparation (RBSP) protocol\nwhich allows the client to prepare single qubits on the server's location with\nweek coherent pulses. This RBSP protocol is inefficient for small $ T $,\nbecause the required number of pulses for generating one single qubit scales as\n$ \\mbox{O}(1/T^4) $, where $ T $ is the transmittance of the quantum channe\nbetween the client and the server.\n  Our contribution in this paper is a modified RBSP protocol with decoy states.\nThis new protocol allows us to generate $ S $ single qubits simultaneously in a\nsingle instance. With our new rotocol, we are able to reduce the number of weak\ncoherent pulses required for generating one single qubit from $ \\mbox{O}(1/T^4)\n$ to nearly $ \\mbox{O}(1/T) $, significantly increasing the efficiency. For a\n100 km standard telecom fiber of loss 0.2 dB/km, our method gives a six orders\nof magnitude improvement in the speed, which is very significant.\n", "  We discuss the use of Langevin molecular dynamics in the investigation of the\nnon-equilibrium properties of disordered vortex matter. Our special focus is\nset on values of system parameters that are realistic for disordered high-$T_c$\nsuperconductors such as YBCO. Using a discretized elastic line model, we study\ndifferent aspects of vortices far from thermal equilibrium. On the one hand we\ninvestigate steady-state properties of driven magnetic flux lines in a\ndisordered environment, namely the current-voltage characteristics, the\ngyration radius, and the pinning time statistics. On the other hand we study\nthe complex relaxation processes and glassy-like dynamics that emerge in\ntype-II superconductors due to the intricate competition between the long-range\nvortex-vortex repulsion and flux pinning due to randomly placed point defects.\nTo this end we consider different types of sudden perturbations: temperature,\nmagnetic field, and external current quenches.\n", "  The continued fraction method (also known as Leaver's method) is one of the\nmost effective techniques used to determine the quasinormal modes of a black\nhole. For extremal black holes, however, the method does not work (since, in\nsuch a case, the event horizon is an irregular singular point of the associated\nwave equation). Fortunately, there exists a modified version of the method,\ndevised by Onozawa et al. [Phys. Rev. D 53, 7033 (1996)], which works for\nneutral massless fields around an extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. In\nthis paper, we generalize the ideas of Onozawa et al. to charged massless\nperturbations around an extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole and to neutral\nmassless perturbations around an extremal Kerr black hole. Similarities and\ndifferences between the results of the original continued fraction method for\nnear extremal black holes and the results of the new continued fraction method\nfor extremal black holes are discussed.\n", "  In this dissertation the question of the unification of quantum theory and\ngeneral relativity is treated. Based on the conceptual structure of these\ntheories and under incorporation of certain ideas from classical philosophy\nthere are formulated arguments for the assertion that these two fundamental\ntheories of nature can only be led to a unification in the framework of a\ndescription, in which space-time is not presupposed but constituted by a more\nfundamental physical reality. Under this precondition an own model to derive\nthe mathematical structure of general relativity from a unified quantum field\ntheory of spinors is developed. In addition the quantum theory of fundamental\nbinary logical alternatives, which has been conceived by Carl Friedrich von\nWeizs\\\"acker in the second half of the twentieth century and in which the\nexistence of physical space and his properties is a consequence of quantum\ntheory, is treated elaborately and considered with respect to the question of\nthe unification of quantum theory and general relativity.\n", "  The ill-posed analytic continuation problem for Green's functions and\nself-energies is investigated by revisiting the Pad\\'{e} approximants\ntechnique. We propose to remedy the well-known problems of the Pad\\'{e}\napproximants by performing an average of several continuations, obtained by\nvarying the number of fitted input points and Pad\\'{e} coefficients\nindependently. The suggested approach is then applied to several test cases,\nincluding Sm and Pr atomic self-energies, the Green's functions of the Hubbard\nmodel for a Bethe lattice and of the Haldane model for a nano-ribbon, as well\nas two special test functions. The sensitivity to numerical noise and the\ndependence on the precision of the numerical libraries are analysed in detail.\nThe present approach is compared to a number of other techniques, i.e. the\nnon-negative least-square method, the non-negative Tikhonov method and the\nmaximum entropy method, and is shown to perform well for the chosen test cases.\nThis conclusion holds even when the noise on the input data is increased to\nreach values typical for quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The ability of the\nalgorithm to resolve fine structures is finally illustrated for two relevant\ntest functions.\n", "  The linear sigma model with linearized fluctuations of all involved fields\nfacilitates the onset of a sequence of first-order phase transitions at a\ncritical point. This phase structure has distinctive imprints on the photon\nemission rates. We argue that analogously a critical point in the QCD phase\ndiagram manifests itself by peculiarities of the photon spectra, in particular\nwhen the dynamical expansion path of matter crosses the phase transition curve\nin the vicinity of the critical point.\n", "  We studied the possibility whether the massive primordial black holes (PBHs)\nsurviving today can be produced in hybrid inflation. Though it is of great\ninterest since such PBHs can be the candidate for dark matter or seeds of the\nsupermassive black holes in galaxies, there have not been quantitatively\ncomplete works yet because of the non-perturbative behavior around the critical\npoint of hybrid inflation. Therefore, combining the stochastic and $\\delta N$\nformalism, we numerically calculated the curvature perturbations in a\nnon-perturbative way and found, without any specific assumption of the types of\nhybrid inflation, PBHs are rather overproduced when the waterfall phase of\nhybrid inflation continues so long that the PBH scale is well enlarged and the\ncorresponding PBH mass becomes sizable enough.\n", "  2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted a lot of attention\nrecently for energy-efficient tunneling-field-effect transistor (TFET)\napplications due to their excellent gate control resulting from their\natomically thin dimensions. However, most TMDs have bandgaps (Eg) and effective\nmasses (m*) outside the optimum range needed for high performance. It is shown\nhere that the newly discovered 2D material, few-layer phosphorene, has several\nproperties ideally suited for TFET applications: 1) direct Eg in the optimum\nrange ~1.0-0.4 eV, 2) light transport m* (0.15m0), 3) anisotropic m* which\nincreases the density of states near the band edges, and 4) a high mobility.\nThese properties combine to provide phosphorene TFET outstanding ION 1 mA/um,\nON/OFF ratio~1e6, scalability to 6 nm channel length and 0.2 V supply voltage,\nthereby significantly outperforming the best TMD-TFETs in energy-delay\nproducts. Full-band atomistic quantum transport simulations establish\nphosphorene TFETs as serious candidates for energy-eficient and scalable\nreplacements of MOSFETs.\n", "  We study the charged scalar collapse in de Sitter spacetimes. With the\nelectric charge, there is one more competitor to join the competition of\ndynamics in the gravitational collapse. We find that two factors can influence\nthe electric charge. If we just adjust the charge conjugation, the electric\ncharge effect is always perturbative at the black hole threshold. The electric\ncharge can also be influenced by the initial conditions of perturbations. These\ninitial parameters can be tuned to control the competition in dynamics and\npresent us new and rich physics in the process of gravitational collapse. We\ngive physical explanations on these phenomena found in dynamics. Furthermore we\nshow that the properties of the gravitational collapse are universal and do not\ndepend on spacetime dimensions.\n", "  We prove that for bounded Lipschitz domains in $\\mathbb{R}^N$ Korn's first\ninequality holds for vector fields satisfying homogeneous mixed normal and\ntangential boundary conditions.\n", "  Here we review the many aspects and distinct phenomena associated to quantum\ndynamics on general graph structures. For so, we discuss such class of systems\nunder the energy domain Green's function ($G$) framework. This approach is\nparticularly interesting because $G$ can be written as a sum over\nclassical-like paths, where local quantum effects are taking into account\nthrough the scattering matrix amplitudes (basically, transmission and\nreflection amplitudes) defined on each one of the graph vertices. Hence, the\n{\\em exact} $G$ has the functional form of a generalized semiclassical formula,\nwhich through different calculation techniques (addressed in details here)\nalways can be cast into a closed analytic expression. It allows to solve\nexactly arbitrary large (although finite) graphs in a recursive and fast way.\nUsing the Green's function method, we survey many properties for open and\nclosed quantum graphs as scattering solutions for the former and eigenspectrum\nand eigenstates for the latter, also considering quasi-bound states. Concrete\nexamples, like cube, binary trees and Sierpi\\'{n}ski-like topologies are\npresented. Along the work, possible distinct applications using the Green's\nfunction methods for quantum graphs are outlined.\n", "  We consider two Lax systems for the homogeneous Painlev\\'{e} II equation: one\nof size $2\\times 2$ studied by Flaschka and Newell in the early 1980's, and one\nof size $4\\times 4$ introduced by Delvaux-Kuijlaars-Zhang and Duits-Geudens in\nthe early 2010's. We prove that solutions to the $4\\times 4$ system can be\nderived from those to the $2\\times 2$ system via an integral transform, and\nconsequently relate the Stokes multipliers for the two systems. As corollaries\nwe are able to express two kernels for determinantal processes as contour\nintegrals involving the Flaschka-Newell Lax system: the tacnode kernel arising\nin models of nonintersecting paths, and a critical kernel arising in a\ntwo-matrix model.\n", "  Applying the constraints dictated by the principle of detailed balance, we\nanalyze a recent proposal for spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking (SMSB) based\non enantioselective autocatalysis coupled to a linear decay of the enantiomers\nand in the presence of reaction noise. We find the racemic state is the final\nstable outcome for both deterministic as well as for stochastic dynamics, and\nfor both well-mixed and small spatially-coupled systems. The racemic outcome\nresults even when the autocatalytic cycles are driven irreversibly by external\nreagents, in manifestly non-equilibrium conditions. Our findings suggest that\nfirst-order autocatalysis coupled to reactions involving \\textit{non-linear}\nheterochiral dynamics is a necessary pre-condition for any mechanism purporting\nto lead to molecular homochirality.\n", "  We obtain classes of black hole solutions constructed from multiplets of\nscalar fields in 2+1 / 3+1 dimensions. The multi-component scalars don't\nundergo a symmetry breaking so that only the isotropic modulus is effective.\nThe Lagrangian is supplemented by a self-interacting potential which plays\nsignificant role in obtaining the exact solutions. In 2+1 / 3+1 dimensions\ndoublet / triplet of scalars is effective which enriches the available black\nhole spacetimes and creates useful Liouville weighted field theoretic models.\n", "  We predict the possibility of \"triply-magic\" optical lattice trapping of\nneutral divalent atoms. In such a lattice, the ${^1}\\!S_{0}$ and ${^3}\\!P_{0}$\nclock states and an additional Rydberg state experience identical optical\npotentials, fully mitigating detrimental effects of the motional decoherence.\nIn particular, we show that this triply magic trapping condition can be\nsatisfied for Yb atom at optical wavelengths and for various other divalent\nsystems (Ca, Mg, Hg and Sr) in the UV region. We assess the quality of triple\nmagic trapping conditions by estimating the probability of excitation out of\nthe motional ground state as a result of the excitations between the clock and\nthe Rydberg states. We also calculate trapping laser-induced photoionization\nrates of divalent Rydberg atoms at magic frequencies. We find that such rates\nare below the radiative spontaneous-emission rates, due to the presence of\nCooper minima in photoionization cross-sections.\n", "  We study the nonlinear optomechanically-induced transparency (OMIT) with gain\nand loss. We find that (i) for a single active cavity, significant enhancement\ncan be achieved for the higher-order sidebands, including the transmission rate\nand the group delay; (ii) for active- passive-coupled cavities, hundreds of\nmicrosecond of optical delay or advance are attainable for the nonlinear\nsideband pulses in the parity-time-symmetric regime. The active higher-order\nOMIT effects, as firstly revealed here, open up the way to make a low-power\noptomechaical amplifier, which can amplify both the strength and group delay of\nnot only the probe light but also its higher-order sidebands.\n", "  Suitably superimposed grey-medium solutions of the Boltzmann transport\nequation (BTE) provide a simple yet accurate description of non-grey\nquasiballistic heat conduction in transient thermal grating experiments. Recent\napplications of similar strategies based on kinetic and\nMcKelvey-Schockley-Landauer theory to time-periodic transport predicted notable\nconductivity suppression only at heating frequencies comparable to phonon\nscattering rates, in contrast to lengthscale criteria observed by several prior\nstudies. Here we show that the frequency-integrated grey-medium approximation\n(FIGMA) is ill suited to tackle temporally periodic quasiballistic transport.\nStarting from first-principles phonon dispersions and scattering rates, we\nobtain semi-analytic 1D BTE solutions for semi-infinite structures subjected to\nsinusoidal surface heating and compare these to the approximate model\ncounterparts. We find FIGMA-based approaches to overestimate the semiconductor\nsurface temperature by up to one and characteristic heating frequencies for\nonset of quasiballistic effects by up to three orders of magnitude\nrespectively. Our study reasserts that experimentally observed\nheating-frequency dependent apparent conductivities originate in the overlap of\nthe characteristic length scale of the thermal gradient with phonon mean free\npaths.\n", "  Experimental results obtained by studying the properties of soft jets in the\n4-velocity space at $\\sqrt{s} \\sim 2-20$ GeV are presented. The changes in the\nmean distance from the jet axis to the jet particles, the mean kinetic energy\nof these particles, and the cluster dimension in response to the growth of the\ncollision energy are consistent with the assumption that quark degrees of\nfreedom manifest themselves in processes of pion jet production at intermediate\nenergies. The energy at which quark degrees of freedom begin to manifest\nthemselves experimentally in the production of soft pion jets is estimated for\nthe first time. The estimated value of this energy is $2.8 \\pm 0.6$ GeV. The\nsuggestions are made for future investigations on NICA.\n", "  The discussion is focused on the study of the fundamental symmetries\n($\\mathcal{P/CP}$) of QCD and geometry of the particle source. The combination\nof correlators corresponding to the absolute asymmetry of distribution of\nelectrically charged particles with respect to the reaction plane in heavy ion\ncollisions is studied. A significant decrease of the absolute asymmetry is\nobserved in the intermediate energy range which can be considered as indication\nof possible transition to predominance of hadronic states over quark-gluon\ndegrees of freedom in the mixed phase created in heavy ion collisions at\nintermediate energies. For the investigation of the energy evolution of the\ngeometric properties of the particle source the use of femtoscopic radii scaled\non the averaged radius of colliding ions is suggested. This approach allows the\nexpansion of the set of interaction types, in particular, on the collisions of\nnon-symmetrical ion beams which can be studied within the framework of common\ntreatment. There is no sharp changing of femtoscopic parameter values with\nincreasing of the initial energy. The suggestions are made for future\nadvancement of these studies on NICA-MPD.\n", "  We theoretically study a Kitaev wire interrupted by an extra site which gives\nrise to super exchange coupling between two Majorana bound states. We show that\nthis system hosts a tunable, non-equlibrium Josephson effect with a\ncharacteristic $8\\pi$ periodicity of the Josephson current. We elucidate the\nphysical mechanism deriving a minimal model for the junction and confirm its\nquantitative accuracy by comparison to the numerical solution of the full\nmodel. The visibility of the $8\\pi$ periodicity of the Josephson current is\nthen studied using time-dependent simulations including the effects of\ndephasing and particle losses. Our findings provide a novel signature of\nMajorana quasi-particles which is qualitatively different form the behavior of\na conventional superconductor, and can be experimentally verified in cold atom\nsystems using alkaline-earth-like atoms.\n", "  We measure the correlation of galaxy lensing and cosmic microwave background\nlensing with a set of galaxies expected to trace the matter density field. The\nmeasurements are performed using pre-survey Dark Energy Survey (DES) Science\nVerification optical imaging data and millimeter-wave data from the 2500 square\ndegree South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SPT-SZ) survey. The two\nlensing-galaxy correlations are jointly fit to extract constraints on\ncosmological parameters, constraints on the redshift distribution of the lens\ngalaxies, and constraints on the absolute shear calibration of DES galaxy\nlensing measurements. We show that an attractive feature of these fits is that\nthey are fairly insensitive to the clustering bias of the galaxies used as\nmatter tracers. The measurement presented in this work confirms that DES and\nSPT data are consistent with each other and with the currently favored\n$\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. It also demonstrates that joint lensing-galaxy\ncorrelation measurement considered here contains a wealth of information that\ncan be extracted using current and future surveys.\n", "  We study the synchronization of a van der Pol self-oscillator with Kerr\nanharmonicity to an external drive. We demonstrate that the anharmonic,\ndiscrete energy spectrum of the quantum oscillator leads to multiple resonances\nin both phase locking and frequency entrainment not present in the\ncorresponding classical system. Strong driving close to these resonances leads\nto nonclassical steady-state Wigner distributions. Experimental realizations of\nthese genuine quantum signatures can be implemented with current technology.\n", "  The spontaneous appearance of nematicity, a state of matter that breaks\nrotation but not translation symmetry, is one of the most intriguing property\nof the iron based superconductors (Fe SC), and has relevance for the cuprates\nas well. Establishing the critical electronic modes behind nematicity remains\nhowever a challenge, because their associated susceptibilities are not easily\naccessible by conventional probes. Here using FeSe as a model system, and\nsymmetry resolved electronic Raman scattering as a probe, we unravel the\npresence of critical charge nematic fluctuations near the structural / nematic\ntransition temperature, T$_S\\sim$ 90 K. The diverging behavior of the\nassociated nematic susceptibility foretells the presence of a Pomeranchuk\ninstability of the Fermi surface with d-wave symmetry. The excellent scaling\nbetween the observed nematic susceptibility and elastic modulus data\ndemonstrates that the structural distortion is driven by this d-wave\nPomeranchuk transition. Our results make a strong case for charge induced\nnematicity in FeSe.\n", "  An autonomous quantum thermal machine comprising a trapped atom or ion placed\ninside an optical cavity is proposed and analysed. Such a machine can operate\nas a heat engine whose working medium is the quantised atomic motion, or as an\nabsorption refrigerator which cools without any work input. Focusing on the\nrefrigerator mode, we predict that it is possible with state-of-the-art\ntechnology to cool a trapped ion almost to its motional ground state using a\nthermal light source such as sunlight. We nonetheless find that a laser or\nsimilar reference system is necessary to stabilise the cavity frequencies.\nFurthermore, we establish a direct and heretofore unacknowledged connection\nbetween the abstract theory of quantum absorption refrigerators and practical\nsideband cooling techniques. We also highlight and clarify some assumptions\nunderlying several recent theoretical studies on self-contained quantum engines\nand refrigerators. Our work indicates that cavity quantum electrodynamics is a\npromising and versatile experimental platform for the study of autonomous\nthermal machines in the quantum domain.\n", "  Bulk applications of graphene in fields such as advanced composites,\nconductive ink, and energy storage require cheap and scalable graphene.\nFortunately, in the last decade, liquid-phase exfoliation of graphite to give\npristine graphene has been thought as a promising way to massive production of\ngraphene at high efficiency and low cost, in terms of the cheap and abundant\ngraphite source and a variety of cost-effective exfoliation techniques. Though\nmany exfoliation techniques are available so far, this article will highlight\nthe recent progress of fluid dynamics route which emerges as a promising\nscalable and efficient way for graphene production in the last five years. The\nemphasis is set on vortex fluidic devices and pressure- and mixer-driven fluid\ndynamics, with our perspectives on the latest progress, exfoliation mechanism,\nand some key issues that require further study in order to realize industrial\napplications.\n", "  In single-molecule magnets, the exchange between a localized spin moment and\nthe electronic background provides a suitable laboratory for studies of\ndynamical aspects of both local spin and transport properties. Here we address\nthe time evolution of a localized spin moment coupled to an electronic level in\na molecular quantum dot embedded in a tunnel junction between metallic leads.\nThe interactions between the localized spin moment and the electronic level\ngenerate an effective interaction between the spin moment at different\ninstances in time. Therefore, we show that, despite being a single-spin system,\nthere are effective contributions of isotropic Heisenberg, and anisotropic\nIsing and Dzyaloshinski-Moriya character acting on the spin moment. The\ninteractions can be controlled by gate voltage, voltage bias, the spin\npolarization in the leads, in addition to external magnetic fields. Signatures\nof the spin dynamics are found in the transport properties of the tunneling\nsystem, and we demonstrate that measurements of the spin current may be used\nfor read-out of the local spin moment orientation.\n", "  We use time dependent perturbation theory to study quantum size effects on\nthe terahertz nonlinear response of metallic graphene armchair nanoribbons of\nfinite length under an applied electric field. Our work shows that quantization\ndue to the finite length of the nanoribbon, the applied field profile, and the\nbroadening of the graphene spectrum all play a significant role in the\nresulting nonlinear conductances. In certain cases, these effects can\nsignificantly enhance the nonlinearity over that for infinitely-long metallic\narmchair graphene nanoribbon.\n", "  In this work, we discuss the connections between pseudo spin, real spin of\nelectrons in material and spin polarization of photo-emitted electrons out of\nmaterial. By investigating these three spin textures for Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and\nSmB$_6$ compounds, we find that the spin orientation of photo-electrons for\nSmB$_6$ has different correspondence to pseudo spin and real spin compare to\nBi$_2$Se$_3$, due to the different symmetry properties of the photo-emission\nmatrix between initial and final states. We calculate the spin polarization and\ncircular dichroism spectra of photo-emitted electrons for both compounds, which\ncan be detected by spin-resolved and circular dichroism angle resolved\nphoto-emission spectroscopy experiment.\n", "  As an indicator of cooperative motion in a system of Brownian particles that\nmodels two-dimensional colloidal liquids, displacement correlation tensor is\ncalculated analytically and compared with numerical results. The key idea for\nthe analytical calculation is to relate the displacement correlation tensor,\nwhich is a kind of four-point space-time correlation, to the Lagrangian\ntwo-time correlation of the deformation gradient tensor. Tensorial treatment of\nthe statistical quantities, including the displacement correlation itself,\nallows capturing the vortical structure of the cooperative motion. The\ncalculated displacement correlation also implies a negative longtime tail in\nthe velocity autocorrelation, which is a manifestation of the cage effect. Both\nthe longitudinal and transverse components of the displacement correlation are\nfound to be expressible in terms of a similarity variable, suggesting that the\ncages are nested to form a self-similar structure in the space-time.\n", "  A cross-Kerr interaction produces a phase shift on two modes of light\nproportional to the number of photons in both modes, and is sometimes called\ncross-phase modulation. Cross-Kerr nonlinearities have many applications in\nclassical and quantum nonlinear optics, including the possibility of a\ndeterministic and all-optical controlled-phase gate. We calculate the one- and\ntwo-photon S-matrix for fields propagating in a medium where the cross-Kerr\ninteraction is spatially distributed at discrete interaction sites comprised of\natoms. For the interactions considered, we analyze the cases where the photons\nco-propagate and counter-propagate through the medium and give a physical\ninterpretation to the differences between the two cases. Finally, we obtain the\nS-matrix in the limit of infinitely long chains, showing that it corresponds to\na perfect controlled-phase operation.\n", "  We show several distinct signatures in the magneto-response of type-II Weyl\nsemimetals. The energy tilt tends to squeeze the Landau levels (LLs), and for a\ntype-II Weyl node, there always exists a critical angle between the B-fileld\nand the tilt, at which the LL spectrum collapses, regardless of the fileld\nstrength. Before collapse, signatures also appear in the magneto-optical\nspectrum, including the invariable presence of intraband peaks, the absence of\nabsorption tails, and the special anisotropic fileld dependence.\n", "  A fundamental and open question is whether cross-Kerr nonlinearities can be\nused to construct a controlled-phase (CPHASE) gate. Here we propose a gate\nconstructed from a discrete set of atom-mediated cross-Kerr interaction sites\nwith counter-propagating photons. We show that the average gate fidelity $F$\nbetween a CPHASE and our proposed gate increases as the number of interaction\nsites increases and the spectral width of the photon decreases, e.g. with 12\nsites we find $F > 99\\%$.\n", "  The quantum magnetotransport properties of a monolayer of molybdenum\ndisulfide are derived using linear response theory. Especially, the effect of\ntopological terms on longitudinal and Hall conductivity is analyzed. The Hall\nconductivity exhibits fractional steps in the integer quantum Hall regime.\nFurther complete spin and valley polarization of the longitudinal conductivity\nis seen in presence of these topological terms. Finally, the Shubnikov-de Hass\noscillations are suppressed or enhanced contingent on the sign of these\ntopological terms.\n", "  Many liquids have curves (isomorphs) in their phase diagrams along which\nstructure, dynamics, and some thermodynamic quantities are invariant in reduced\nunits. A substantial part of their phase diagrams is thus effectively one\ndimensional. The shape of these isomorphs is described by a material-dependent\nfunction of density $h(\\rho)$, which for real liquids is well approximated by a\npower law $\\rho^\\gamma$. However, in simulations, a power law is not adequate\nwhen density changes are large; typical models such as the Lennard-Jones liquid\nshow that $\\gamma(\\rho) \\equiv \\mathrm{d} \\ln h(\\rho)/\\mathrm{d} \\ln \\rho$ is a\ndecreasing function of density. This paper presents results from computer\nsimulations using a new pair potential that diverges at a nonzero distance and\ncan be tuned to give a more realistic shape of $\\gamma(\\rho)$. Our results\nindicate that the finite size of molecules is an important factor to take into\naccount when modeling liquids over a large density range.\n", "  Realising the promise of next-generation magnetic nanotechnologies is\ncontingent on the development of novel methods for controlling magnetic states\nat the nanoscale. There is currently demand for simple and flexible techniques\nto access exotic magnetisation states without convoluted fabrication and\napplication processes. 360 degree domain walls (metastable twists in\nmagnetisation separating two domains with parallel magnetisation) are one such\nstate, which is currently of great interest in data storage and magnonics.\nHere, we demonstrate a straightforward and powerful process whereby a moving\nmagnetic charge, provided experimentally by a magnetic force microscope tip,\ncan write and manipulate magnetic charge states in ferromagnetic nanowires. The\nmethod is applicable to a wide range of nanowire architectures with\nconsiderable benefits over existing techniques. We confirm the method's\nefficacy via the injection and spatial manipulation of 360 degree domain walls\nin Py and Co nanowires. Experimental results are supported by micromagnetic\nsimulations of the tip-nanowire interaction.\n", "  Dilepton production in heavy-ion collisions at collider energies - i.e., for\nthe Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\n- is studied within an approach that uses coarse-grained transport simulations\nto calculate thermal dilepton emission applying in-medium spectral functions\nfrom hadronic many-body theory and partonic production rates based on lattice\ncalculations. The microscopic output from the Ultra-relativistic Quantum\nMolecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model is hereby put on a grid of space-time cells\nwhich allows to extract the local temperature and chemical potential in each\ncell via an equation of state. The resulting dilepton spectra are in good\nagreement with the experimental results for the range of RHIC energies,\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=19.6 - 200$ GeV. The comparison of data and model outcome shows\nthat the newest measurements by the PHENIX and STAR collaborations are\nconsistent and that the low-mass spectra can be described by a cocktail of\nhadronic decay contributions together with thermal emission from broadened\nvector-meson spectral functions and from the Quark-Gluon Plasma phase.\nPredictions for dilepton results at LHC energies show no significant change of\nthe spectra as compared to RHIC, but a higher fraction of thermal contribution\nand harder slopes of the transverse momentum distributions due to the higher\ntemperatures and flow obtained.\n", "  Recently Guerout et al. [Phys. Rev. E, v.93, 022108 (2016)] advocated that\nthe lossless plasma model has to be redefined as the limit of the Drude model\nwhen the relaxation parameter goes to zero. It was claimed that the previously\nused plasma model cannot correctly describe the Casimir pressure between two\nplates made of both nonmagnetic and magnetic metals and has to be replaced with\nthe redefined one. We show that the suggested redefinition does not satisfy\nnecessary physical requirements imposed on the dielectric permittivity. We also\npresent a plausible explanation to the fact that the lossless plasma model\ndescribes the Casimir pressure correctly even though it does not match the\noptical and electrical properties of metals.\n", "  We examine the development and detectability of the $m=1$ instability in the\nremnant of binary neutron star mergers. The detection of the gravitational mode\nassociated with the $m=1$ degree of freedom could potentially reveal details of\nthe equation of state. We analyze the post-merger epoch of simulations of both\nequal and non-equal mass neutron star mergers using three realistic,\nmicrophysical equations of state and neutrino cooling. Our studies show such an\ninstability develops generically and within a short dynamical time to strengths\nthat are comparable or stronger than the $m=2$ mode which is the strongest\nduring the early post-merger stage. We estimate the signal to noise ratio that\nmight be obtained for the $m=1$ mode and discuss the prospects for observing\nthis signal with available Earth-based detectors. Because the $m=1$ occurs at\nroughly half the frequency of the more powerful $m=2$ signal and because it can\npotentially be long-lived, targeted searches could be devised to observe it. We\nestimate that with constant amplitude direct detection of the mode could occur\nup to a distance of roughly $14\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$ whereas a search triggered by\nthe inspiral signal could extend this distance to roughly $100\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}$.\n", "  We proceed to study Yang-Baxter deformations of the AdS$_5\\times$S$^5$\nsuperstring with the classical Yang-Baxter equation. We make a general argument\non the supercoset construction and present the master formula to describe the\ndilaton in terms of classical $r$-matrices. The supercoset construction is\nexplicitly performed for some classical $r$-matrices and the full backgrounds\nincluding the Ramond-Ramond (R-R) sector and dilaton are derived. Within the\nclass of abelian $r$-matrices, the perfect agreement is shown for well-known\nexamples including gravity duals of non-commutative gauge theories,\n$\\gamma$-deformations of S$^5$ and Schr\\\"odinger spacetimes. It would be\nremarkable that the supercoset construction works well, even if the resulting\nbackgrounds are not maximally supersymmetric. In particular, three-parameter\n$\\gamma$-deformations of S$^5$ and Schr\\\"odinger spacetimes do not preserve any\nsupersymmetries. As for non-abelian $r$-matrices, we will focus upon a specific\nexample. The resulting background does not satisfy the equation of motion of\nthe Neveu-Schwarz-Neveu-Schwarz (NS-NS) two-form because the R-R three-form is\nnot closed.\n", "  We quantitatively estimate properties of the quark-gluon plasma created in\nultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions utilizing Bayesian statistics and a\nmulti-parameter model-to-data comparison. The study is performed using a\nrecently developed parametric initial condition model, TRENTO, which\ninterpolates among a general class of particle production schemes, and a modern\nhybrid model which couples viscous hydrodynamics to a hadronic cascade. We\ncalibrate the model to multiplicity, transverse momentum, and flow data and\nreport constraints on the parametrized initial conditions and the\ntemperature-dependent transport coefficients of the quark-gluon plasma. We show\nthat initial entropy deposition is consistent with a saturation-based picture,\nextract a relation between the minimum value and slope of the\ntemperature-dependent specific shear viscosity, and find a clear signal for a\nnonzero bulk viscosity.\n", "  Using Darboux method, we obtain an asymptotic limit for Continuous Dual Hahn\nPolynomial.The basic concept is to construct a comparison function which is the\nsingular part of the generating function; then expand the comparison function.\nWith little simplification and modification,the asymptotic limit is achieved.\n", "  We have measured the performances of a LYSO crystal matrix prototype tested\nwith electron and photon beams in the energy range 60$-$450 MeV. This study has\nbeen carried out to determine the achievable energy and time resolutions for\nthe calorimeter of the Mu2e experiment.\n", "  Computationally-guided material discovery is being increasingly employed\nusing a descriptor-based screening through the calculation of a few properties\nof interest. A precise understanding of the uncertainty associated with first\nprinciples density functional theory calculated property values is important\nfor the success of descriptor-based screening. Bayesian error estimation\napproach has been built-in to several recently developed exchange-correlation\nfunctionals, which allows an estimate of the uncertainty associated with\nproperties related to the ground state energy, for e.g. adsorption energies.\nHere, we propose a robust and computationally efficient method for quantifying\nuncertainty in mechanical properties, which depends on the derivatives of the\nenergy. The procedure involves calculating the energy around the equilibrium\ncell volume with different strains and fitting the obtained energies to the\ncorresponding energy-strain relationship. At each strain, we use instead of a\nsingle energy, an ensemble of energies, giving us an ensemble of fits and\nthereby, an ensemble of mechanical properties associated with each fit, whose\nspread can be used to quantify its uncertainty. The generation of ensemble of\nenergies is only a post-processing step involving a perturbation of parameters\nof the exchange-correlation functional and solving for the energy non-self\nconsistently. The proposed method is computationally efficient and provides a\nmore robust uncertainty estimate compared to the approach of self-consistent\ncalculations employing several different exchange-correlation functionals. We\ndemonstrate the method by calculating the uncertainty bounds for Si using the\ndeveloped method. We show that the calculated uncertainty bounds the property\nvalues obtained using three different GGA functionals: PBE, PBEsol and RPBE.\n", "  In this paper, we study the fractality of void probability distribution\nmeasured in $^{32}$S-Ag/Br interaction at an incident energy of $200$ GeV per\nnucleon. A radically different and rigorous method called \\textit{Visibility\nGraph} analysis is used. This method is shown to reveal a strong scaling\ncharacter of void probability distribution in all pseurorapidity regions. The\nscaling exponent, called the Power of the Scale-freeness in Visibility\nGraph(PSVG), a quantitative parameter related to Hurst exponent, is strongly\nfound to be dependent on the rapidity window size.\n", "  We discuss a simple non-supersymmetric model based on the electroweak gauge\ngroup $SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)^\\prime\\times U(1)_{B-L}$ where the lightest of the\nright-handed neutrinos, which are part of the leptonic doublet of\n$SU(2)^\\prime$, play the role of a long-lived unstable dark matter with mass in\nthe multi-PeV range. We use a resonant $s$-channel annihilation to obtain the\ncorrect thermal relic density and relax the unitarity bound on dark matter\nmass. In this model, there exists a 3-body dark matter decay mode producing tau\nleptons and neutrinos, which could be the source for the PeV cascade events\nobserved in the IceCube experiment. The model can be tested with more precise\nflavor information of the highest-energy neutrino events in future data.\n", "  The Dirac Hamiltonian formalism is applied to a system in $(2+1)$-dimensions\nconsisting of a Dirac field $\\psi$ minimally coupled to Chern-Simons $U(1)$ and\n$SO(2,1)$ connections, $A$ and $\\omega$, respectively. This theory is connected\nto a supersymmetric Chern-Simons form in which the gravitino has been projected\nout (unconventional supersymmetry) and, in the case of a flat background,\ncorresponds to the low energy limit of graphene. The separation between\nfirst-class and second-class constraints is performed explicitly, and both the\nfield equations and gauge symmetries of the Lagrangian formalism are fully\nrecovered. The degrees of freedom of the theory in generic sectors shows that\nthe propagating states correspond to fermionic modes in the background\ndetermined by the geometry of the graphene sheet and the nondynamical\nelectromagnetic field. This is shown for the following canonical sectors: i) a\nconformally invariant generic description where the spinor field and the\ndreibein are locally rescaled; ii) a specific configuration for the Dirac\nfermion consistent with its spin, where Weyl symmetry is exchanged by time\nreparametrizations; iii) the vacuum sector $\\psi=0$, which is of interest for\nperturbation theory. For the latter the analysis is adapted to the case of\nmanifolds with boundary, and the corresponding Dirac brackets together with the\ncentrally extended charge algebra are found. Finally, the $SU(2)$\ngeneralization of the gauge group is briefly treated, yielding analogous\nconclusions for the degrees of freedom.\n", "  We investigate the relaxation dynamics of magnetic vortex lines in type-II\nsuperconductors following rapid changes of the external driving current by\nmeans of an elastic line model simulated with Langevin molecular dynamics. A\nsystem of flux vortices in a sample with randomly distributed point-like\ndefects is subjected to an external current of appropriate strength for a\nsufficient period of time so as to be in a moving non-equilibrium steady state.\nThe current is then instantaneously lowered to a value that pertains to either\nthe moving or pinned regime. The ensuing relaxation of the flux lines is\nstudied via one-time observables such as their mean velocity and radius of\ngyration. We have in addition measured the two-time flux line height\nautocorrelation function to investigate dynamical scaling and aging behavior in\nthe system, which in particular emerge after quenches into the glassy pinned\nstate.\n", "  We introduce a decision scheme for optimally choosing a classifier, which\nsegments the cosmic web into different structure types (voids, sheets,\nfilaments, and clusters). Our framework, based on information theory, accounts\nfor the design aims of different classes of possible applications: (i)\nparameter inference, (ii) model selection, and (iii) prediction of new\nobservations. As an illustration, we use cosmographic maps of web-types in the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey to assess the relative performance of the classifiers\nT-web, DIVA and ORIGAMI for: (i) analyzing the morphology of the cosmic web,\n(ii) discriminating dark energy models, and (iii) predicting galaxy colors. Our\nstudy substantiates a data-supported connection between cosmic web analysis and\ninformation theory, and paves the path towards principled design of analysis\nprocedures for the next generation of galaxy surveys. We have made the cosmic\nweb maps, galaxy catalog, and analysis scripts used in this work publicly\navailable.\n", "  We introduce a new selected configuration interaction plus perturbation\ntheory algorithm that is based on a deterministic analog of our recent\nefficient heat-bath sampling algorithm. This Heat-bath Configuration\nInteraction (HCI) algorithm makes use of two parameters that control the\ntradeoff between speed and accuracy, one which controls the selection of\ndeterminants to add to a variational wavefunction, and one which controls the\nthe selection of determinants used to compute the perturbative correction to\nthe variational energy. We show that HCI provides an accurate treatment of both\nstatic and dynamic correlation by computing the potential energy curve of the\nmultireference carbon dimer in the cc-pVDZ basis. We then demonstrate the speed\nand accuracy of HCI by recovering the full configuration interaction energy of\nboth the carbon dimer in the cc-pVTZ basis and the strongly-correlated chromium\ndimer in the Ahlrichs VDZ basis, correlating all electrons, to an accuracy of\nbetter than 1 mHa, in just a few minutes on a single core. These systems have\nfull variational spaces of 3x10^14 and 2x10^22 determinants respectively.\n", "  A very simple linear signal predictor that uses past predicted values rather\nthan past signal values for prediction is presented. Man-made or natural\nsystems utilizing this predictor would not require a memory of input signal\nvalues but only of already predicted, internalized states. This delay-induced\nnegative group delay (DINGD) predictor affords real-time prediction of signals\nwithout the need for a specific signal model. Its properties are derived\nanalytically and are numerically tested on various types of broadband input\ndata.\n", "  We compute the chiral condensate in 2+1-flavor QCD through the spectrum of\nlow-lying eigenmodes of Dirac operator. The number of eigenvalues of the Dirac\noperator is evaluated using a stochastic method with an eigenvalue filtering\ntechnique on the background gauge configurations generated by lattice QCD\nsimulations including the effects of dynamical up, down and strange quarks\ndescribed by the Mobius domain-wall fermion formulation. The low-lying spectrum\nis related to the chiral condensate, which is one of the leading order\nlow-energy constants in chiral effective theory, as dictated by the\nBanks-Casher relation. The spectrum shape and its dependence on the sea quark\nmasses calculated in numerical simulations are consistent with the expectation\nfrom one-loop chiral perturbation theory. After taking the chiral limit as well\nas the continuum limit using the data at three lattice spacings ranging\n0.080-0.045 fm, we obtain $\\Sigma^{1/3}$(2 GeV) = 270.0(4.9) MeV, with the\nerror combining those from statistical and from various sources of systematic\nerrors. Finite volume effect is confirmed to be under control by a direct\ncomparison of the results from two different volumes at the lightest available\nsea quarks corresponding to 230 MeV pions.\n", "  Analytic and approximate solutions for the energy eigenvalues generated by\nthe hyperbolic potentials\n$V_m(x)=-U_0\\sinh^{2m}(x/d)/\\cosh^{2m+2}(x/d),\\,m=0,1,2,\\dots$ are constructed.\nA byproduct of this work is the construction of polynomial solutions for the\nconfluent Heun equation along with necessary and sufficient conditions for the\nexistence of such solutions based on the evaluation of a three-term recurrence\nrelation. Very accurate approximate solutions for the general problem with\narbitrary potential parameters are found by use of the {\\it asymptotic\niteration method}.\n", "  Direct spectroscopic biosignature characterization (hereafter \"biosignature\ncharacterization\") will be a major focus for future space observatories\nequipped with coronagraphs or starshades. Our aim in this article is to provide\nan introduction to potential detector and cooling technologies for biosignature\ncharacterization. We begin by reviewing the needs. These include nearly\nnoiseless photon detection at flux levels as low as\n$<0.001~\\textrm{photons}~s^{-1}~\\textrm{pixel}^{-1}$ in the visible and\nnear-IR. We then discuss potential areas for further testing and/or development\nto meet these needs using non-cryogenic detectors (EMCCD, HgCdTe array, HgCdTe\nAPD array), and cryogenic single photon detectors (MKID arrays and TES\nmicrocalorimeter arrays). Non-cryogenic detectors are compatible with the\npassive cooling that is strongly preferred by coronagraphic missions, but would\nadd non-negligible noise. Cryogenic detectors would require active cooling, but\nin return deliver nearly quantum limited performance. Based on the flight\ndynamics of past NASA missions, we discuss reasonable vibration expectations\nfor a large UV-Optical-IR space telescope (LUVOIR) and preliminary cooling\nconcepts that could potentially fit into a vibration budget without being the\nlargest element. We believe that a cooler that meets the stringent vibration\nneeds of a LUVOIR is also likely to meet those of a starshade-based Habitable\nExoplanet Imaging Mission.\n", "  We propose an experiment for measuring the effective Casimir pressure between\ntwo parallel SiC plates with aligned nuclear spins. The prospective constraints\non an axion-neutron coupling constant for both hadronic and GUT axions are\ncalculated using the process of one-axion exchange. For this purpose, a general\nexpression for the additional pressure arising between two polarized plates due\nto the exchange of one axion between their constituent fermions is derived. We\ndemonstrate that only the polarization component perpendicular to the plates\ncontribute to the pressure. The obtained pressure can be both repulsive and\nattractive depending on whether the polarizations of both plates are\nunidirectional or directed in opposite directions. It is shown that although\nthe constraints on an axion-electron coupling obtained in the case of\nmagnetized plates are not competitive, the constraints on an axion-neutron\ncoupling found for plates with polarized nuclear spins are of the same order of\nmagnitude of those obtained previously for the GUT axions alone using the\nprocess of two-axion exchange. The proposed experiment allows also to\nstrengthen the presently known constraints on the axion-neutron coupling\nconstants of GUT axions by using both processes of one- and two-axion exchange.\n", "  We consider a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate with and without\nsynthetic \"spin-orbit\" interactions in two dimensions. Density- and\nphase-fluctuations of the condensate are included, allowing us to study the\nimpact of thermal fluctuations and density-density interactions on the physics\noriginating with spin-orbit interactions. In the absence of spin-orbit\ninteractions, we find that inter-component density interactions deplete the\nminority condensate. The thermally driven phase transition is driven by coupled\ndensity and phase-fluctuations, but is nevertheless shown to be a\nphase-transition in the Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with close to\nuniversal amplitude ratios irrespective of whether both the minority- and\nmajority condensates exist in the ground state, or only one condensate exists.\nIn the presence of spin-orbit interactions we observe three separate phases,\ndepending on the strength of the spin-orbit coupling and inter-component\ndensity-density interactions: a phase-modulated phase with uniform amplitudes\nfor small intercomponent interactions, a completely imbalanced, effectively\nsingle-component, condensate for intermediate spin-orbit coupling strength and\nsuficciently large inter-component interactions, and a phase-modulated\n\\textit{and} amplitude-modulated phase for sufficiently large values of both\nthe spin-orbit coupling and the inter-component density-density interactions.\nThe phase which is modulated by a single $\\bv q$-vector only is observed to\ntransition into an isoptropic liquid through a strong de-pinning transition\nwith periodic boundary conditions, which weakens with open boundaries.\n", "  CT images are widely used in pathology detection and follow-up treatment\nprocedures. Accurate identification of pathological features requires\ndiagnostic quality CT images with minimal noise and artifact variation. In this\nwork, a novel Fourier-transform based metric for image quality (IQ) estimation\nis presented that correlates to additive CT image noise. In the proposed\nmethod, two windowed CT image subset regions are analyzed together to identify\nthe extent of variation in the corresponding Fourier-domain spectrum. The two\nsquare windows are chosen such that their center pixels coincide and one window\nis a subset of the other. The Fourier-domain spectral difference between these\ntwo sub-sampled windows is then used to isolate spatial regions-of-interest\n(ROI) with low signal variation (ROI-LV) and high signal variation (ROI-HV),\nrespectively. Finally, the spatial variance ($var$), standard deviation\n($std$), coefficient of variance ($cov$) and the fraction of abdominal ROI\npixels in ROI-LV ($\\nu'(q)$), are analyzed with respect to CT image noise. For\nthe phantom CT images, $var$ and $std$ correlate to CT image noise ($|r|>0.76$\n($p\\ll0.001$)), though not as well as $\\nu'(q)$ ($r=0.96$ ($p\\ll0.001$)).\nHowever, for the combined phantom and patient CT images, $var$ and $std$ do not\ncorrelate well with CT image noise ($|r|<0.46$ ($p\\ll0.001$)) as compared to\n$\\nu'(q)$ ($r=0.95$ ($p\\ll0.001$)). Thus, the proposed method and the metric,\n$\\nu'(q)$, can be useful to quantitatively estimate CT image noise.\n", "  The interference of the $\\rho^0$ and $\\omega$ mesons has been studied in the\nhadronic and leptonic decay channels, i.e., dipion and dilepton decay channels\nrespectively, but this interference is not studied yet in the semihadronic or\nsemileptonic decay channel, e.g., $V \\to \\pi^0\\gamma$. $V$ denotes either\n$\\rho^0$ or $\\omega$ meson. To look for the quoted interference in the\n$\\pi^0\\gamma$ decay channel as well as the contribution of $\\rho$ meson to the\ncross section, the correlated $\\pi^0\\gamma$ invariant mass distribution spectra\nare calculated in the photonuclear reaction in the multi-GeV region. It is\nassumed that these bosons arise in the final state due to the decay of $\\rho^0$\nand $\\omega$ mesons which are photoproduced coherently in the isoscalar\nnucleus. The elementary reaction in the nucleus is considered to proceed as\n$\\gamma N \\to VN$; $V \\to \\pi^0\\gamma$. The forward propagation of the $\\rho$\nand $\\omega$ mesons and the near forward emission of pion are considered, so\nthat they can be described by the eikonal form. The meson nucleus interactions\nare evaluated using $t\\varrho$ approximation. Replacing the decay vertex $V \\to\n\\pi^0\\gamma$ by $V \\to \\pi^+\\pi^-$ in the above formalism, it is also used to\nstudy the $\\rho-\\omega$ interference in the $\\pi^+\\pi^-$ decay channel.\n", "  The original local, discrete example of Linear Unitary Cellular Automata\n(LUCA) is analyzed in terms of a new representation previously introduced in\n[1] for classical CA. Several important underlying symmetries are reviewed and\ntheir tight relationship with both signal and coding theory as well as with\ncombinatorics is underlined. A class of analog implementations in the form of\nLinear Transmission Line Networks (LTLN) is described as possible emulators of\nthis type of dynamics.\n", "  Following the $\\alpha$ decay of $^{233}$U, $^{229}$Th recoil ions are shown\nto be extracted in a significant amount from the MLL buffer-gas stopping cell.\nThe produced recoil ions and subsequent daughter nuclei are mass purified with\nthe help of a customized quadrupole mass spectrometer. The combined extraction\nand mass-purification efficiency for $^{229}$Th$^{3+}$ is determined via\nMCP-based measurements and via the direct detection of the $^{229}$Th $\\alpha$\ndecay. A large value of $(10\\pm2)$\\% for the combined extraction and\nmass-purification efficiency of $^{229}$Th$^{3+}$ is obtained at a mass\nresolution of about 1 u/e. In addition to $^{229}$Th, also other\n$\\alpha$-recoil ions of the $^{233,232}$U decay chains are addressed.\n", "  Below $T_N = 1.1$K, the XY pyrochlore Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ orders into a $k=0$\nnon-collinear, antiferromagnetic structure referred to as the $\\psi_2$ state.\nThe magnetic order in Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ is known to obey conventional three\ndimensional (3D) percolation in the presence of magnetic dilution, and in that\nsense is robust to disorder. Recently, however, two theoretical studies have\npredicted that the $\\psi_2$ structure should be unstable to the formation of a\nrelated $\\psi_3$ magnetic structure in the presence of magnetic vacancies. To\ninvestigate these theories, we have carried out systematic elastic and\ninelastic neutron scattering studies of three single crystals of\nEr$_{2-x}$Y$_x$Ti$_2$O$_7$ with $x=0$ (pure), 0.2 (10$\\%$-Y) and 0.4\n(20$\\%$-Y), where magnetic Er$^{3+}$ is substituted by non-magnetic Y$^{3+}$.\nWe find that the $\\psi_2$ ground state of pure Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ is\nsignificantly affected by magnetic dilution. The characteristic domain\nselection associated with the $\\psi_2$ state, and the corresponding energy gap\nseparating $\\psi_2$ from $\\psi_3$, vanish for Y$^{3+}$ substitutions between\n10$\\%$-Y and 20$\\%$-Y, far removed from the 3D percolation threshold of\n$\\sim$60$\\%$-Y. The resulting ground state for Er$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ with magnetic\ndilutions from 20$\\%$-Y up to the percolation threshold is naturally\ninterpreted as a frozen mosaic of $\\psi_2$ and $\\psi_3$ domains.\n", "  In this work, we propose, fabricate and characterize a full duplex\ncommunication system using visible light on a single chip. Both the suspended\np-n junction InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well (MQW) devices and the suspended\nwaveguides are obtained on a GaN-on-silicon platform by wafer-level processing.\nTwo suspended p-n junction InGaN/GaN MQW devices that can both emit and detect\nlight simultaneously are connected using suspended waveguides to form an\nin-plane visible light communication (VLC) system. The light that is emitted\nfrom one suspended p-n junction InGaN/GaN MQW device can induce a current in\nthe device located at the other end of the waveguide via in-plane light\ncoupling, thus leading to full duplex communication using visible light. This\nproof-of-concept in-plane VLC system paves the way towards the implementation\nof a full duplex communications system operating at the same frequency using\nvisible light on a single chip.\n", "  Despite its simplicity, it seems to my best of knowledge that the possibly\nsimplest approach towards deriving equations governing irreversible\nthermodynamics from gas-kinetic considerations within the framework of\nclassical mechanics has never been pursued. In this paper we address this\nomission and derive the equations describing the irreversible thermodynamics of\na gas in a piston and associated thermodynamic cycles performed in finite time.\nWhat we find is a thermodynamic action principle: The irreversible work we\nrequire for performing a thermodynamic cycle in finite time times the time we\nrequire to run through the cycle, a isothermal compression/decompression cycle\nfor instance, will always be larger or equal to a lower bound given by a system\nspecific constant with the dimension of an action. This process specific action\nconstants can take values of the order of Plank's constant for microscopic\nprocesses, such as displacing a Hydrogen atom by one atom diameter. For\nmacroscopic processes (e.g. a bicycle pump) also the action constant takes\nmacroscopically observable values. We discuss the finite time Carnot cycle, and\nestimate the lower bound for irreversible work required when rewriting\nphysically embodied bits of information and compare the resulting values with\nLandauer's bond, the irreversible amount of energy that needs to be dissipated\nfor re-writing a bit.\n", "  We (Riedel et al. Nature 2015), as well as others, have showed that some\nenzymes exhibit enhanced diffusion when active. In a recent PRL, (Golestanian,\nPRL 2015, arXiv:1508.03219) R.Golestanian theoretically examines a number of\npossible explanations for this phenomenon and concludes that \"collective\nheating\" is the best candidate to account for the observed diffusion\ncoefficient increase. Here we present evidence showing that collective heating\ncannot possibly apply to our experiments.\n", "  The bulk of X-ray emission from pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars is coronal in\norigin. We demonstrate herein that stars on Henyey tracks in the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram have lower $\\log(L_X/L_\\ast)$, on average, than\nstars on Hayashi tracks. This effect is driven by the decay of $L_X$ once stars\ndevelop radiative cores. $L_X$ decays faster with age for intermediate mass PMS\nstars, the progenitors of main sequence A-type stars, compared to those of\nlower mass. As almost all main sequence A-type stars show no detectable X-ray\nemission, we may already be observing the loss of their coronae during their\nPMS evolution. Although there is no direct link between the size or mass of the\nradiative core and $L_X$, the longer stars have spent with partially convective\ninteriors, the weaker their X-ray emission becomes. This conference paper is a\nsynopsis of Gregory, Adams and Davies (2016).\n", "  High-resolution pionic-atom x-ray spectroscopy was performed with an x-ray\nspectrometer based on a 240-pixel array of superconducting\ntransition-edge-sensor (TES) microcalorimeters at the piM1 beam line of the\nPaul Scherrer Institute. X-rays emitted by pionic carbon via the 4f->3d\ntransition and the parallel 4d->3p transition were observed with a\nfull-width-at-half-maximum energy resolution of 6.8 eV at 6.4 keV. Measured\nx-ray energies are consistent with calculated electromagnetic values which\nconsidered the strong-interaction effect assessed via the Seki-Masutani\npotential for the 3p energy level, and favor the electronic population of two\nfilled 1s electrons in the K-shell. Absolute energy calibration with an\nuncertainty of 0.1 eV was demonstrated under a high-rate hadron beam condition\nof 1.45 MHz. This is the first application of a TES spectrometer to\nhadronic-atom x-ray spectroscopy and is an important milestone towards\nnext-generation high-resolution kaonic-atom x-ray spectroscopy.\n", "  We propose and analyze extended floor field cellular automaton models for\nevacuation dynamics of inhomogeneous pedestrian pairs which are coupled by\nasymmetric group interactions. Such pairs consist of a leader, who mainly\ndetermines the couple's motion and a follower, who has a defined tendency to\nfollow the leader. Examples for such pairs are mother and child or two siblings\nof different age. We examine the system properties and compare them to the case\nof a homogeneous crowd. We find a strong impact on evacuation times for the\nregime of strong pair coupling due to the occurrence of a clogging phenomenon.\nIn addition we obtain a non-trivial dependence of evacuation times on the\nfollowers' coupling to the static floor field, which carries the information of\nthe shortest way to the exit location. In particular we find that systems with\nfully passive followers, who are solely coupled to their leaders, show lower\nevacuation times than homogeneous systems where all pedestrians have an equal\ntendency to move towards the exit. We compare the results of computer\nsimulations with recently performed experiments.\n", "  We present $\\mathrm{^{12}CO}$ and $\\mathrm{^{13}CO}$ molecular gas data\nobserved by ALMA, massive early stage young stellar objects identified by\napplying color-magnitude cuts to \\textit{Spitzer} and \\textit{Herschel}\nphotometry, and low-mass late stage young stellar objects identified via\nH$\\mathrm{\\alpha}$ excess. Using dendrograms, we derive properties for the\nmolecular cloud structures. This is the first time a dendrogram analysis has\nbeen applied to extragalactic clouds. The majority of clumps have a virial\nparameter equal to unity or less. The size-linewidth relations of\n$\\mathrm{^{12}CO}$ and $\\mathrm{^{13}CO}$ show the clumps in this study have a\nlarger linewidth for a given size (by factor of 3.8 and 2.5, respectively) in\ncomparison to several, but not all, previous studies. The larger linewidths in\n30 Doradus compared to typical Milky Way quiescent clumps are probably due to\nthe highly energetic environmental conditions of 30 Doradus. The slope of the\nsize-linewidth relations of $\\mathrm{^{12}CO}$, 0.65 $\\pm$ 0.04, and\n$\\mathrm{^{13}CO}$, 0.97 $\\pm$ 0.12, are on the higher end but consistent\nwithin 3$\\mathrm{\\sigma}$ of previous studies. Massive star formation occurs in\nclumps with high masses ($> 1.83 \\times 10^{2}\\;\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$), high\nlinewidths (v $> 1.18\\;\\mathrm{km/s}$), and high mass densities ($> 6.67 \\times\n10^{2}\\;\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}\\;pc^{-2}}$). The majority of embedded, massive young\nstellar objects are associated with a clump. However the majority of more\nevolved, low-mass young stellar objects are not associated with a clump.\n", "  Polarized thermal emission from interstellar dust grains can be used to map\nmagnetic fields in star forming molecular clouds and the diffuse interstellar\nmedium (ISM). The Balloon-borne Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope for\nPolarimetry (BLASTPol) flew from Antarctica in 2010 and 2012 and produced\ndegree-scale polarization maps of several nearby molecular clouds with\narcminute resolution. The success of BLASTPol has motivated a next-generation\ninstrument, BLAST-TNG, which will use more than 3000 linear polarization\nsensitive microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) combined with a 2.5m\ndiameter carbon fiber primary mirror to make diffraction-limited observations\nat 250, 350, and 500 $\\mu$m. With 16 times the mapping speed of BLASTPol,\nsub-arcminute resolution, and a longer flight time, BLAST-TNG will be able to\nexamine nearby molecular clouds and the diffuse galactic dust polarization\nspectrum in unprecedented detail. The 250 $\\mu$m detector array has been\nintegrated into the new cryogenic receiver, and is undergoing testing to\nestablish the optical and polarization characteristics of the instrument.\nBLAST-TNG will demonstrate the effectiveness of kilo-pixel MKID arrays for\napplications in submillimeter astronomy. BLAST-TNG is scheduled to fly from\nAntarctica in December 2017 for 28 days and will be the first balloon-borne\ntelescope to offer a quarter of the flight for \"shared risk\" observing by the\ncommunity.\n", "  The electronic, phonon, and thermoelectric properties of a two-dimensional\nHfS2 monolayer are investigated by using the first-principles calculations\ncombined with the Boltzmann transport theory. The band valleys of the HfS2\nmonolayer can be effectively tuned by the applied biaxial strain. The Seebeck\ncoefficient and therefore the peak value of the power factor (with the\nrelaxation time inserted) increase when the degeneracy of the band valleys is\nincreased by the strain. When no strain is applied, the HfS2 monolayer is an\nexcellent n-type thermoelectric material, while the thermoelectric performance\nof the p-type doped one is poor. The applied tensile strain of 6% can increase\nthe room-temperature ZT value of the p-type doped system to 3.67, which is five\ntimes larger than that of the unstrained one. The much more balanced ZT values\nof the p- and n-type doping are favorable for fabrication of both p- and n-legs\nof thermoelectric modules. Our results indicate that the thermoelectric\nperformance of the HfS2 monolayer can be greatly improved by the valley\nengineering through the method of strain.\n", "  Molecular dynamics simulations of the interface structure in binary AgCu\neutectic were performed by using the realistic EAM potential. In simulations,\nwe examined such quantities as the time dependence of the total energy in the\nprocess of equilibration, the probability distributions, the composition\nprofiles for the components, and the component diffusivities within the\ninterface zone. It is shown that the equilibrium in the solid state associated\nwith the complete phase separation in binary eutectic is accompanied by\nformation of the steady disordered diffusion zone at the boundary of the\ncrystalline components. At higher temperatures, closer to the eutectic point,\nthe increase in the width of the steady diffusion zone is observed. The\nparticle diffusivities grow therewith to the numbers typical for the liquid\nphase. Above the eutectic point, the steady zone does not form, instead, the\ncomplete contact melting in the system occurs. The results of simulations\nindicate that during the temperature increase the phenomenon of contact melting\nis preceded by the similar process spatially localized in the vicinity of the\ninterface.\n", "  Electrostatic gating is essential for defining and control of semiconducting\ndevices. However, nano-fabrication processes required for depositing gates\ninevitably degrade the pristine quality of the material of interest. Examples\nof materials that suffer from such degradation include ultra-high mobility\nGaAs/AlGaAs two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs), graphene, topological\ninsulators, and nanowires. To preserve the pristine material properties, we\nhave developed a flip-chip setup where gates are separated from the material by\na vacuum, which allows nanoscale electrostatic gating of the material without\nexposing it to invasive nano-processing. An additional benefit is the vacuum\nbetween gates and material, which, unlike gate dielectrics, is free from charge\ntraps. We demonstrate the operation and feasibility of the flip-chip setup by\nachieving quantum interference at integer quantum Hall states in a\nFabry-P\\'erot interferometer based on a GaAs/AlGaAs 2DEG. Our results pave the\nway for the study of exotic phenomena including fragile fractional quantum Hall\nstates by preserving the high quality of the material.\n", "  Crystal defect statistics is developed by minimizing the Gibbs free energy of\ndefect formation, which is commonly converted to a crystallite size-independent\nequation by applying Stirling's approximation. Solutions of this equation\nforecast Arrhenius-like temperature dependence for the concentrations of all\ndefect types, and higher defect populations for nanocrystals due to the smaller\nformation free energies involved. Here, we improve the accuracy in the\nmathematical processing of the equation describing the defect population at\nthermodynamic equilibrium and show that this equation is intrinsically\nsize-dependent. The new model predicts lower defect concentrations for smaller\ncrystallites, and shows that vacancy-free crystallites smaller than a\ndeterminable critical size are thermodynamically stable at elevated\ntemperatures. Our findings describe the previously reported data on the\nmechanical properties of a number of nanocrystals and lead to a revised and\ndeeper understanding of many morphological occurrences in micro- and\nnanocrystals.\n", "  Recent studies of two-photon excitation of exciton-polaritons in\nmicrocavities have considered the possibility of an allowed absorption process\ninto the $2p$-state of the excitons which participate in the polariton effect.\nHere we report time-resolved measurements of two-photon excitation directly\ninto the lower polariton states invoking the $1s$ state of the excitons.\nAlthough this process is forbidden by symmetry for light at normal incidence,\nit is allowed at non-zero angle of incidence due to state mixing.\n", "  The seminal works of Bekenstein and Hawking have revealed that black holes\nhave a well-defined thermodynamic description. In particular, it is often\nstated in the physical literature that black holes, like mundane physical\nsystems, obey the first law of thermodynamics: $\\Delta S=\\Delta\nE/T_{\\text{BH}}$, where $T_{\\text{BH}}$ is the Bekenstein-Hawking temperature\nof the black hole. In the present work we test the regime of validity of the\nthermodynamic description of gravity. In particular, we provide compelling\nevidence that, due to quantum effects, the first law of thermodynamics breaks\ndown in the low-temperature regime $T_{\\text{BH}}\\times r_{\\text{H}}\\lesssim\n({{\\hbar}/{r_{\\text{H}}}})^2$ of near-extremal black holes (here $r_{\\text{H}}$\nis the radius of the black-hole horizon).\n", "  The most general electromagnetic boundary, defined by linear and local\nboundary conditions, is defined in terms of conditions which can be called\ngeneralized impedance boundary conditions. Requiring that the boundary be\nequivalent to PEC and PMC boundaries for its two eigen-plane waves, which\nproperty is known to exist for many of its special cases, it is shown that the\nrecently introduced Generalized Soft-and-Hard/DB (GSHDB) boundary is the most\ngeneral boundary satisfying this property.\n", "  Recent works demonstrated that remote sensing observations of shock waves\npropagating into the corona and associated with major solar eruptions can be\nused to derive the strength of coronal magnetic fields met by the shock over a\nvery large interval of heliocentric distances and latitudes. This opinion\narticle will summarize most recent results obtained on this topic and will\ndiscuss the weaknesses and strengths of these techniques to open a constructive\ndiscussion with the scientific community.\n", "  There have been several recent detections of candidate Keplerian discs around\nmassive young protostars. Given the relatively large disc-to-star mass ratios\nin these systems, and their young ages, it is worth investigating their\npropensity to becoming self-gravitating. To this end, we compute\nself-consistent, semi-analytic models of putative self-gravitating discs for\nfive candidate disc systems. Our aim is not to fit exactly the observations,\nbut to demonstrate that the expected dust continuum emission from marginally\nunstable self-gravitating discs can be quite weak, due to high optical depth at\nthe midplane even at millimetre wavelengths. In the best cases, the models\nproduce \"observable\" disc masses within a factor of <1.5 of those observed,\nwith midplane dust temperatures comparable to measured temperatures from\nmolecular line emission. We find in two cases that a self-gravitating disc\nmodel compares well with observations. If these discs are self-gravitating,\nthey satisfy the conditions for disc fragmentation in their outer regions.\nThese systems may hence have as-yet-unresolved low mass stellar companions, and\nare thus promising targets for future high angular resolution observations.\n", "  Hyper doping Si with up to 6 at.% Ti in solid solution was performed by ion\nimplantation followed by pulsed laser annealing and flash lamp annealing. In\nboth cases, the implanted Si layer can be well recrystallized by liquid phase\nepitaxy and solid phase epitaxy, respectively. Cross-sectional transmission\nelectron microscopy of Ti-implanted Si after liquid phase epitaxy shows the\nso-called growth interface breakdown or cellular breakdown owing to the\noccurrence of constitutional supercooling in the melt. The appearance of\ncellular breakdown prevents further recrystallization. However, the\nout-diffusion and cellular breakdown can be effectively suppressed by solid\nphase epitaxy during flash lamp annealing due to the high velocity of\namorphous-crystalline interface and the low diffusion velocity for Ti in the\nsolid phase.\n", "  Atomic partial charges appear in the Coulomb term of many force-field models\nand can be derived from electronic structure calculations with a myriad of\natoms-in-molecules (AIM) methods. More advanced models have also been proposed,\nusing the distributed nature of the electron cloud and atomic multipoles. In\nthis work, an electrostatic force field is defined through a concise\napproximation of the electron density, for which the Coulomb interaction is\ntrivially evaluated. This approximate \"pro-density\" is expanded in a minimal\nbasis of atom-centered s-type Slater density functions, whose parameters are\noptimized by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the pro-density from\na reference electron density, e.g. obtained from an electronic structure\ncalculation. The proposed method, Minimal Basis Iterative Stockholder (MBIS),\nis a variant of the Hirshfeld AIM method but it can also be used as a\ndensity-fitting technique. An iterative algorithm to refine the pro-density is\neasily implemented with a linear-scaling computational cost, enabling\napplications to supramolecular systems. The benefits of the MBIS method are\ndemonstrated with systematic applications to molecular databases and extended\nmodels of condensed phases. A comparison to 14 other AIM methods shows its\neffectiveness when modeling electrostatic interactions. MBIS is also suitable\nfor rescaling atomic polarizabilities in the Tkatchenko-Sheffler scheme for\ndispersion interactions.\n", "  The formation process of massive stars is not well understood, and\nadvancement in our understanding benefits from high resolution observations and\nmodelling of the gas and dust surrounding individual high-mass (proto)stars.\nHere we report sub-arcsecond (<1550 au) resolution observations of the young\nmassive star G11.92-0.61 MM1 with the SMA and VLA. Our 1.3 mm SMA observations\nreveal consistent velocity gradients in compact molecular line emission from\nspecies such as CH$_3$CN, CH$_3$OH, OCS, HNCO, H$_2$CO, DCN and CH$_3$CH$_2$CN,\noriented perpendicular to the previously reported bipolar molecular outflow\nfrom MM1. Modelling of the compact gas kinematics suggests a structure\nundergoing rotation around the peak of the dust continuum emission. The\nrotational profile can be well fit by a model of a Keplerian disc, including\ninfall, surrounding an enclosed mass of 30-60M$_{\\odot}$, of which\n2-3M$_{\\odot}$ is attributed to the disc. From modelling the CH$_3$CN emission,\nwe determine that two temperature components, of 150 K and 230 K, are required\nto adequately reproduce the spectra. Our 0.9 and 3.0cm VLA continuum data\nexhibit an excess above the level expected from dust emission; the full\ncentimetre-submillimetre wavelength spectral energy distribution of MM1 is well\nreproduced by a model including dust emission, an unresolved hypercompact\nH{\\i}{\\i} region, and a compact ionised jet. In combination, our results\nsuggest that MM1 is an example of a massive proto-O star forming via disc\naccretion, in a similar way to that of lower mass stars.\n", "  I describe the contributions of Guido Altarelli to the development of Quantum\nChromodynamics from the discovery of asymptotic freedom until the end of the\nS$p\\bar{p}$S collider era, 1973-1985.\n", "  The giant frequency shift was observed in Raman spectra for inramolecular O-H\nvibration band. The effect was observed in SERS-condition experiment, when\nexciting light was focused by short-focus objective on the Ag-surface, merged\nin water. The shift was detected relatively to the regularl position of band,\nmeasured from the bulk of water under the same other conditions.\n", "  Liposome vesicles tend to align with an applied magnetic field. This is due\nto the directional magnetic susceptibility difference of the lipids which form\nthe membrane of these vesicles. In this work a model of liposome vesicles\nexposed to magnetic field is presented. Starting from the base energy of a\nlipid membrane in a magnetic field, the force applied to the surrounding fluids\nis derived. This force is then used to investigate the dynamics of vesicle in\nthe presence of magnetic fields.\n", "  Strong optical pulses at mid-infrared and terahertz frequencies have recently\nemerged as a powerful tool to manipulate and control the solid state and\nespecially complex condensed matter systems with strongly correlated electrons.\nThe recent developments in high-power sources in the 0.1-30 THz frequency\nrange, both from table-top laser systems and Free-Electron Lasers, has provided\naccess to excitations of molecules and solids, which can be stimulated at their\nresonance frequencies. Amongst these, we discuss free electrons in metals,\nsuperconducting gaps and Josephson plasmons in layered superconductors,\nvibrational modes of the crystal lattice (phonons), as well as magnetic\nexcitations. This Review provides an overview and illustrative examples of how\nintense THz transients can be used to resonantly control matter, with\nparticular focus on strongly correlated electron systems and high-temperature\nsuperconductors.\n", "  We perform the first self-consistent measurement of the rate of interactions\nbetween stellar tidal streams created by disrupting satellites and dark\nsubhalos in a cosmological simulation of a Milky-Way-mass galaxy. Using a\nretagged version of the Aquarius A dark-matter-only simulation, we selected 18\nstreams of tagged star particles that appear thin at the present day and\nfollowed them from the point their progenitors accrete onto the main halo,\nrecording in each snapshot the characteristics of all dark-matter subhalos\npassing within several distance thresholds of any tagged star particle in each\nstream. We considered distance thresholds corresponding to constant impact\nparameters (1, 2, and 5 kpc), as well as those proportional to the region of\ninfluence of each subhalo (one and two times its half-mass radius $r_{1/2}$).\nWe then measured the age and present-day, phase-unwrapped length of each stream\nin order to compute the interaction rate in different mass bins and for\ndifferent thresholds, and compared these to analytic predictions from the\nliterature. We measure a median rate of $1.5^{+3.0}_{-1.1}\\\n(9.1^{+17.5}_{-7.1},\\ 61.8^{+211}_{-40.6})$ interactions within 1 (2, 5) kpc of\nthe stream per 10 kpc of stream length per 10 Gyr. Resolution effects (both\ntime and particle number) affect these estimated rates by lowering them.\n", "  We consider an atom described by M\\\"uller theory, which is similar to\nHartree-Fock theory, but with a modified exchange term. We prove that a nucleus\nof charge Z can bind at most Z+C electrons, where C is a universal constant.\nOur proof proceeds by comparison with Thomas-Fermi theory and a key ingredient\nis a novel bound on the number of electrons far from the nucleus.\n", "  We synthesized distorted octahedral(T') molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2) and\ninvestigated its vibrational properties with Raman spectroscopy, density\nfunctional theory and symmetry analysis. Compared to the results from high\ntemperature centrosymmetric monoclinic (T'mo) phase, four new Raman bands\nemerge in the low temperature orthorhombic (T'or) phase, which was recently\npredicted to be a type II Weyl semimetal. Crystal-angle-dependent,\nlight-polarization-resolved measurements indicate that all the observed Raman\npeaks belong to two categories: those vibrating along the zigzag Mo atomic\nchain (z-mode) and those vibrating in the mirror plane (m-mode) perpendicular\nto the zigzag chain. Interestingly the low energy shear z-mode and shear\nm-mode, absent from the T'mo spectra, become activated when sample cooling\ninduces a phase transition to the T'or crystal structure. We interpret this\nobservation as a consequence of inversion-symmetry breaking, which is crucial\nfor the existence of Weyl fermions in the layered crystal. Our temperature\ndependent Raman measurements further show that both the high energy m-mode at\n130 cm-1 and the low energy shear m-mode at 12 cm-1 provide useful gauges for\nmonitoring the broken inversion symmetry in the crystal.\n", "  We show that in a simple experiment at undergraduate level, suitable to be\nperformed in classes of science and engineering students, it is possible to\ntest accurately, on a popular 1N4148 p-n diode, the range of the junction\ncurrents where the Shockley equation model can be considered satisfactory. The\nexperiment benefits from a system of temperature control and data collection\ndriven in a LabVIEW environment. With these tools a large quantity of data can\nbe recorded in the temporal frame of a lab session. Significant deviations of\nthe experimental I-V with respect to the ideal behaviour curve predicted by the\nShockley equation are observed, both at low and high current. A better\nagreement over the entire range is obtained introducing, as is customary, a\nfour parameters model, including a parallel and a series resistance. A new\niterative fitting procedure is presented which treats the I-V data of different\nregimes on the same level, and allows a simultaneous determination of the four\nparameters for each temperature selected. Moreover, the knowledge of the\ntemperature dependence of saturation current is used to estimate the energy gap\nof silicon. The connection of a macroscopic measure with a microscopic quantity\nis another valuable feature of this experiment, from an educational point of\nview.\n", "  Measurements of several top-quark properties obtained from CMS data collected\nat various centre-of-mass energies are presented. The results include\nmeasurements of the top pair charge asymmetry, $\\textrm{t}\\bar{\\textrm{t}}$\nspin correlation, CP violation and the cross section of\n$\\textrm{t}\\bar{\\textrm{t}}$ events produced in association with a W or a Z\nboson. The results are compared with predictions from the standard model as\nwell as new physics models.\n", "  Here we obtain analytical expressions for the frequency response of a\ncantilever beam in the presence of ambient fluid. The advantage of our\napproach, besides its simplicity of use, is that it explicitly contains the\nviscosity and the density of the ambient fluid. Thus, if measuring the\nfrequency spectrum, the expression can be used in the design of viscometers.\nConversely, if the ambient fluid is known, the expression can be used in the\ndesign of force gauges such as in Atomic Force Microscopy.\n", "  In this paper we review recent work on novel computing paradigms using\ncoupled oscillatory dynamical systems. We explore systems of relaxation\noscillators based on linear state transitioning devices, which switch between\ntwo discrete states with hysteresis. By harnessing the dynamics of complex,\nconnected systems we embrace the philosophy of \"let physics do the computing\"\nand demonstrate how complex phase and frequency dynamics of such systems can be\ncontrolled, programmed and observed to solve computationally hard problems.\nAlthough our discussion in this paper is limited to Insulator-to-Metallic (IMT)\nstate transition devices, the general philosophy of such computing paradigms\ncan be translated to other mediums including optical systems. We present the\nnecessary mathematical treatments necessary to understand the time evolution of\nthese systems and demonstrate through recent experimental results the potential\nof such computational primitives.\n", "  This paper explores advanced electrode modeling in the context of separate\nand parallel transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) and\nelectroencephalography (EEG) measurements. We focus on boundary condition based\napproaches that do not necessitate adding auxiliary elements, e.g. sponges, to\nthe computational domain. In particular, we investigate the complete electrode\nmodel (CEM) which incorporates a detailed description of the skin-electrode\ninterface including its contact surface, impedance and normal current\ndistribution. The CEM can be applied for both tES and EEG electrodes which is\nadvantageous when a parallel system is used. In comparison to the CEM, we test\ntwo important reduced approaches: the gap model (GAP) and the point electrode\nmodel (PEM). We aim to find out the differences of these approaches for a\nrealistic numerical setting based on the stimulation of the auditory cortex.\nThe results obtained suggest, among other things, that GAP and GAP/PEM are\nsufficiently accurate for the practical application of tES and parallel\ntES/EEG, respectively. Differences between CEM and GAP were observed mainly in\nthe skin compartment, where only CEM explains the heating effects\ncharacteristic to tES.\n", "  We study direct and inverse eigenvalue problems for a pair of harmonic\nfunctions with a spectral parameter in boundary and coupling conditions. The\ndirect problem is relevant to sloshing frequencies of free oscillations of a\ntwo-layer fluid in a container. The upper fluid occupies a layer bounded above\nby a free surface and below by a layer of fluid of greater density. Both fluids\nare assumed to be inviscid, incompressible, and heavy, whereas the free surface\nand the interface between fluids are supposed to be bounded.\n", "  Co and CoO thin films were deposited by magnetron sputtering in the form of\nmultilayers. They were irradiated with Ar and Si ion beams of different\nenergies and fluences. The magnetic properties were investigated.\n", "  Coatings of ternary nanocomposite Si-C-N ceramic coatings have shown newer\nand improved mechanical and functional properties over the coarser and\nmonolithic coatings. Properties like high hardness, wear resistance, oxidation\nresistance, tunable band gap and chemical inertness have been observed for\nSi-C-N which makes its potential for numerous applications. Although lot of\nresearch has taken place in Si-C-N coatings, proper understanding of the effect\nof different parameters on the coating properties are still not resolved. The\nchanges occurring in fraction of Si, C and N and the phases forming in the\ncoatings with variation in deposition conditions require investigations. This\nresearch paper gives a systematic study of the role of different deposition\nparameters like substrate temperature, pressure, power on the nucleation and\ngrowth, structure, microstructural bonding and mechanical properties of the\nfilm deposited by magnetron sputtering which adds significantly to the\nfundamental knowledge of nanocomposite Si-C-N coatings as well as its\napplications.\n", "  Our aim here is to address the problem of decomposing a whole network into a\nminimal number of ego-centered subnetworks. For this purpose, the network egos\nare picked out as the members of a minimum dominating set of the network.\nHowever, to find such an efficient dominating ego-centered construction, we\nneed to be able to detect all the minimum dominating sets and to compare all\nthe corresponding dominating ego-centered decompositions of the network. To\nfind all the minimum dominating sets of the network, we are developing a\ncomputational heuristic, which is based on the partition of the set of nodes of\na graph into three subsets, the always dominant vertices, the possible dominant\nvertices and the never dominant vertices, when the domination number of the\nnetwork is known. To compare the ensuing dominating ego-centered decompositions\nof the network, we are introducing a number of structural measures that count\nthe number of nodes and links inside and across the ego-centered subnetworks.\nFurthermore, we are applying the techniques of graph domination and\nego=centered decomposition for six empirical social networks.\n", "  The method of decoherent histories allows probabilities to be assigned to\nsequences of quantum events in systems, such as the universe as a whole, where\nthere is no external observer to make measurements. This paper applies the\nmethod of decoherent histories to address cosmological questions. Using a\nseries of simple examples, beginning with the harmonic oscillator, we show that\nsystems in a stationary state such as an energy eigenstate or thermal state can\nexhibit decoherent histories with non-trivial dynamics. We then examine\ndecoherent histories in a universe that undergoes eternal inflation. Decoherent\nhistories that assign probabilities to sequences of events in the vicinity of a\ntimelike geodesic supply a natural cosmological measure. Under reasonable\nconditions, such sequences of events do not suffer from the presence of\nunlikely statistical fluctuations that mimic reality.\n", "  Many optical applications depend on amplitude modulating optical beams using\ndevices such as acousto-optical modulators (AOMs) or optical choppers. Methods\nto add amplitude modulation (AM) often inadvertently impart phase modulation\n(PM) onto the light as well. While this PM is of no consequence to many\nphase-insensitive applications, phase-sensitive processes can be affected. Here\nwe study the effects of input phase and amplitude modulation on the output of a\nquantum-noise limited phase-sensitive optical amplifier (PSA) realized in hot\n$^{85}$Rb vapor. We investigate the dependence of PM on AOM alignment and\ndemonstrate a novel approach to quantifying PM by using the PSA as a diagnostic\ntool. We then use this method to measure the alignment-dependent PM of an\noptical chopper which arises due to diffraction effects as the chopper blade\npasses through the optical beam.\n", "  We study large N dualities for a class of ${\\cal N} = 1$ theories realized on\ntype IIB D5 branes wrapping 2-cycles of local Calabi-Yau threefolds which is\nobtained from resolving orbifolded conifolds or as effective field theories on\nD4 branes in type IIA brane configurations. The field theory is $\\mathcal{N}\n=1$ supersymmetric $\\prod U(N_{ij})$ Yang-Mills gauge theory. Strong coupling\neffects are analyzed in the deformed geometry. We propose open-closed string\nduality via a geometric transition in toric geometry. The T-dual type IIA\npicture and M-theory lifting are also considered.\n"]}
