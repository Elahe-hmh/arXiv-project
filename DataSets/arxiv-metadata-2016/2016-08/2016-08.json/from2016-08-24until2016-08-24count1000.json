perturbation theory is reviewed. To show the\nessence of this perturbation theory, we concentrate only on the universe filled\nwith a single scalar field. Through this review, we point out the problems\nwhich should be clarified for the further theoretical sophistication of this\nperturbation theory. We also expect that this theoretical sophistication will\nbe also useful to discuss the theoretical predictions of Non-Gaussianity in CMB\nand comparison with observations.\n", "  A large fraction of papers in the climate literature includes erroneous uses\nof significance tests. A Bayesian analysis is presented to highlight the\nmeaning of significance tests and why typical misuse occurs. It is concluded\nthat a significance test very rarely provides useful quantitative information.\nThe significance statistic is not a quantitative measure of how confident we\ncan be of the 'reality' of a given result.\n", "  A discontinuous Galerkin method for the ideal 5 moment two-fluid plasma\nsystem is presented. The method uses a second or third order discontinuous\nGalerkin spatial discretization and a third order TVD Runge-Kutta time stepping\nscheme. The method is benchmarked against an analytic solution of a dispersive\nelectron acoustic square pulse as well as the two-fluid electromagnetic shock\nand existing numerical solutions to the GEM challenge magnetic reconnection\nproblem. The algorithm can be generalized to arbitrary geometries and three\ndimensions. An approach to maintaining small gauge errors based on error\npropagation is suggested.\n", "  We analyze the Lattice Boltzmann method for the simulation of fluctuating\nhydrodynamics by Adhikari et al. [Europhys. Lett. 71, 473 (2005)] and find that\nit shows excellent agreement with theory even for small wavelengths as long as\na stationary system is considered. This is in contrast to other finite\ndifference and older lattice Boltzmann implementations that show convergence\nonly in the limit of large wavelengths. In particular cross correlators vanish\nto less than 0.5%. For larger mean velocities, however, Galilean invariance\nviolations manifest themselves through errors of a magnitude similar to those\nof the earlier implementations.\n", "  We investigate the dynamical basis of the classic empirical models\n(specifically, Sersic-Einasto and generalized NFW) that are widely used to\ndescribe the distributions of collisionless matter in galaxies. We submit that\nsuch a basis is provided by our \\alpha-profiles, shown to constitute solutions\nof the Jeans dynamical equilibrium with physical boundary conditions. We show\nhow to set the parameters of the empirical in terms of the dynamical models; we\nfind the empirical models, and specifically Sersic-Einasto, to constitute a\nsimple and close approximation to the dynamical models. Finally, we discuss how\nthese provide an useful baseline for assessing the impact of the small-scale\ndynamics that may modulate the density slope in the central galaxy regions.\n", "  Resonant solutions of the quantum Schr\\\"odinger equation occur at complex\nenergies where the S-matrix becomes singular. Knowledge of such resonances is\nimportant in the study of the underlying physical system. Often the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation is dependent on some parameter and one is interested in\nfollowing the path of the resonances in the complex energy plane as the\nparameter changes. This is particularly true in coupled channel systems where\nthe resonant behavior is highly dependent on the strength of the channel\ncoupling, the energy separation of the channels and other factors. In previous\nwork it was shown that numerical continuation, a technique familiar in the\nstudy of dynamical systems, can be brought to bear on the problem of following\nthe resonance path in one dimensional problems and multi-channel problems\nwithout energy separation between the channels. A regularization can be defined\nthat eliminates coalescing poles and zeros that appear in the S-matrix at the\norigin due to symmetries. Following the zeros of this regularized function then\ntraces the resonance path. In this work we show that this approach can be\nextended to channels with energy separation, albeit limited to two channels.\nThe issue here is that the energy separation introduces branch cuts in the\ncomplex energy domain that need to be eliminated with a so-called\nuniformization. We demonstrate that the resulting approach is suitable for\ninvestigating resonances in two-channel systems and provide an extensive\nexample.\n", "  The no-hair theorem characterizes the fundamental nature of black holes in\ngeneral relativity. This theorem can be tested observationally by measuring the\nmass and spin of a black hole as well as its quadrupole moment, which may\ndeviate from the expected Kerr value. Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole at\nthe center of the Milky Way, is a prime candidate for such tests thanks to its\nlarge angular size, high brightness, and rich population of nearby stars. In\nthis review I discuss a new theoretical framework for a test of the no-hair\ntheorem that is ideal for imaging observations of Sgr A* with very-long\nbaseline interferometry (VLBI). The approach is formulated in terms of a\nKerr-like spacetime that depends on a free parameter and is regular everywhere\noutside of the event horizon. Together with the results from astrometric and\ntiming observations, VLBI imaging of Sgr A* may lead to a secure test of the\nno-hair theorem.\n", "  We present an algorithm for the stochastic simulation of gene expression and\nheterogeneous population dynamics. The algorithm combines an exact method to\nsimulate molecular-level fluctuations in single cells and a constant-number\nMonte Carlo method to simulate time-dependent statistical characteristics of\ngrowing cell populations. To benchmark performance, we compare simulation\nresults with steadystate and time-dependent analytical solutions for several\nscenarios, including steadystate and time-dependent gene expression, and the\neffects on population heterogeneity of cell growth, division, and DNA\nreplication. This comparison demonstrates that the algorithm provides an\nefficient and accurate approach to simulate how complex biological features\ninfluence gene expression. We also use the algorithm to model gene expression\ndynamics within \"bet-hedging\" cell populations during their adaption to\nenvironmental stress. These simulations indicate that the algorithm provides a\nframework suitable for simulating and analyzing realistic models of\nheterogeneous population dynamics combining molecular-level stochastic reaction\nkinetics, relevant physiological details and phenotypic variability.\n", "  The ground state phase of spin-1/2 $J_1$-$J_2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg\nmodel on square lattice around the maximally frustrated regime ($J_2\\sim\n0.5J_1$) has been debated for decades. Here we study this model using the\ncluster update algorithm for tensor product states (TPSs). The ground state\nenergies at finite sizes and in the thermodynamic limit (with finite size\nscaling) are in good agreement with exact diagonalization study. Through finite\nsize scaling of the spin correlation function, we find the critical point\n$J_2^{c_1}=0.572(5)J_1$ and critical exponents $\\nu=0.50(8)$, $\\eta_s=0.28(6)$.\nIn the range of $0.572 < J_2/J_1 \\leqslant 0.6 $ we find a paramagnetic ground\nstate with exponentially decaying spin-spin correlation. Up to $24\\times 24$\nsystem size, we observe power law decaying dimer-dimer and plaquette-plaquette\ncorrelations with an anomalous plaquette scaling exponent $\\eta_p=0.24(1)$ and\nan anomalous columnar scaling exponent $\\eta_c=0.28(1)$ at $J_2/J_1=0.6$. These\nresults are consistent with a potential gapless $U(1)$ spin liquid phase.\nHowever, since the $U(1)$ spin liquid is unstable due to the instanton effect,\na VBS order with very small amplitude might develop in the thermodynamic limit.\nThus, our numerical results strongly indicate a deconfined quantum critical\npoint (DQCP) at $J_2^{c_1}$. Remarkably, all the observed critical exponents\nare consistent with the $J-Q$ model.\n", "  A new approach to simulation of stationary flows by Direct Simulation Monte\nCarlo method is proposed. The idea is to specify an individual time step for\neach component of a gas mixture. The approach consists of modifications mainly\nto collision phase and recommendation on choosing time step ratios. It allows\nsoftening the demands on the computational resources for cases of disparate\ncollision diameters of molecules and/or disparate molecular masses. These are\nthe cases important in vacuum deposition technologies. Few tests of the new\napproach are made. Finally, the usage of new approach is demonstrated on a\nproblem of silver nanocluster diffusion in carrier gas argon in conditions of\nsilver deposition experiments.\n", "  The Manley--Rowe constants of motion (MRC) are conservation laws written out\nfor a dynamical system describing the time evolution of the amplitudes in\nresonant triad. In this paper we extend the concept of MRC to resonance\nclusters of any form yielding generalized Manley--Rowe constants (gMRC) and\ngive a constructive method how to compute them. We also give details of a\n\\emph{Mathematica} implementation of this method. While MRC provide\nintegrability of the underlying dynamical system, gMRC generally do not but may\nbe used for qualitative and numerical study of dynamical systems describing\ngeneric resonance clusters.\n", "  In this paper we give the first attempt to model the evolution of the\nspectrum of PSR B1259$-$63 radio emission while the pulsar orbits the companion\nBe star. As suggested by Kijak et al. (Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 418:L114,\n2011a) this binary system can be useful in understanding the origin of the\ngigahertz-peaked spectrum of pulsars. The model explains, at least\nqualitatively, the observed alterations of the spectral shape depending on the\norbital phases of this pulsar. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that\nthe external factors have a significant impact on the observed radio emission\nof a pulsar. The model can also contribute to our understanding of the origin\nof some non-typical spectral shapes(e.g. flat or broken spectra).\n", "  In this paper we develop a class of Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta schemes for\nsolving the multi-scale semiconductor Boltzmann equation. The relevant scale\nwhich characterizes this kind of problems is the diffusive scaling. This means\nthat, in the limit of zero mean free path, the system is governed by a\ndrift-diffusion equation. Our aim is to develop a method which accurately works\nfor the different regimes encountered in general semiconductor simulations: the\nkinetic, the intermediate and the diffusive one. Moreover, we want to overcome\nthe restrictive time step conditions of standard time integration techniques\nwhen applied to the solution of this kind of phenomena without any\ndeterioration in the accuracy. As a result, we obtain high order time and space\ndiscretization schemes which do not suffer from the usual parabolic stiffness\nin the diffusive limit. We show different numerical results which permit to\nappreciate the performances of the proposed schemes.\n", "  We present a high precision frequency determination method for digitized NMR\nFID signals. The method employs high precision numerical integration rather\nthan simple summation as in many other techniques. With no independent\nknowledge of the other parameters of a NMR FID signal (phase $\\phi$, amplitude\n$A$, and transverse relaxation time $T_{2}$) this method can determine the\nsignal frequency $f_{0}$ with a precision of $1/(8\\pi^{2}f_{0}^{2}T_{2}^{2})$\nif the observation time $T$ is long enough. The method is especially convenient\nwhen the detailed shape of the observed FT NMR spectrum is not well defined.\nWhen $T_{2}$ is $+\\infty$ and the signal becomes pure sinusoidal, the precision\nof the method is $3/(2\\pi^{2}f_{0}^{2}T^{2})$ which is one order more precise\nthan a typical frequency counter. Analysis of this method shows that the\nintegration reduces the noise by bandwidth narrowing as in a lock-in amplifier,\nand no extra signal filters are needed. For a pure sinusoidal signal we find\nfrom numerical simulations that the noise-induced error in this method reaches\nthe Cramer-Rao Lower Band(CRLB) on frequency determination. For the damped\nsinusoidal case of most interest, the noise-induced error is found to be within\na factor of 2 of CRLB when the measurement time $T$ is a few times larger than\n$T_{2}$.We discuss possible improvements for the precision of this method.\n", "  Correlation functions in the O(n) models below the critical temperature are\nconsidered. Based on Monte Carlo (MC) data, we confirm the fact stated earlier\nby Engels and Vogt, that the transverse two-plane correlation function of the\nO(4) model for lattice sizes about L=120 and small external fields h is very\nwell described by a Gaussian approximation. However, we show that fits of not\nlower quality are provided by certain non-Gaussian approximation. We have also\ntested larger lattice sizes, up to L=512. The Fourier-transformed transverse\nand longitudinal two-point correlation functions have Goldstone mode\nsingularities in the thermodynamic limit at k --> 0 and h=+0, i.e., G_perp(k) =\na k^{-lambda_perp} and G_parallel(k) = b k^{-lambda_parallel}, respectively.\nHere a and b are the amplitudes, k is the magnitude of the wave vector. The\nexponents lambda_perp, lambda_parallel and the ratio b M^2/a^2, where M is the\nspontaneous magnetization, are universal according to the GFD (grouping of\nFeynman diagrams) approach. Here we find that the universality follows also\nfrom the standard (Gaussian) theory, yielding b M^2/a^2 = (n-1)/16. Our MC\nestimates of this ratio are 0.06 +/- 0.01 for n=2, 0.17 +/- 0.01 for n=4 and\n0.498 +/- 0.010 for n=10. According to these and our earlier MC results, the\nasymptotic behavior and Goldstone mode singularities are not exactly described\nby the standard theory. This is expected from the GFD theory. We have found\nappropriate analytic approximations for G_perp(k) and G_parallel(k), well\nfitting the simulation data for small k. We have used them to test the\nPatashinski--Pokrovski relation and have found that it holds approximately.\n", "  The subsurface properties of active regions prior to their appearance at the\nsolar surface may shed light on the process of active region formation.\nHelioseismic holography has been applied to samples taken from two populations\nof regions on the Sun (pre-emergence and without emergence), each sample having\nover 100 members, that were selected to minimize systematic bias, as described\nin Paper I (Leka et al., 2012). Paper II (Birch et al., 2012) showed that there\nare statistically significant signatures in the average helioseismic properties\nthat precede the formation of an active region. This paper describes a more\ndetailed analysis of the samples of pre-emergence regions and regions without\nemergence, based on discriminant analysis. The property that is best able to\ndistinguish the populations is found to be the surface magnetic field, even a\nday before the emergence time. However, after accounting for the correlations\nbetween the surface field and the quantities derived from helioseismology,\nthere is still evidence of a helioseismic precursor to active region emergence\nthat is present for at least a day prior to emergence.\n", "  The implicit 2D3V particle-in-cell (PIC) code developed to study the\ninteraction of ultrashort pulse lasers with matter [G. M. Petrov and J. Davis,\nComputer Phys. Comm. 179, 868 (2008); Phys. Plasmas 18, 073102 (2011)] has been\nparallelized using MPI (Message Passing Interface). Details on the algorithm\nimplementation are given with emphasis on code optimization by overlapping\ncomputations with communications. Performance evaluation has been made on a\nsmall Linux cluster with 32 processors for two typical regimes of PIC\noperation: \"particle dominated\", for which the bulk of the computation time is\nspent on pushing particles, and \"field dominated\", for which computing the\nfields is prevalent. We found that the MPI implementation of the code offers a\nsignificant numerical speedup. In the \"particle dominated\" regime it is close\nto the maximum theoretical one, while in the other regime it is about 75-80 %\nof the maximum speed-up. The code parallelization will allow future\nimplementation of atomic physics and extension to three dimensions.\n", "  By analogy with the kinetic theory of gases, most turbulence modeling strate-\ngies rely on an eddy viscosity to model the unresolved turbulent fluctuations.\nHow- ever, the ratio of unresolved to resolved scales - very much like a degree\nof rarefaction - is not taken into account by the popular conventional schemes,\nbased on the Navier- Stokes equations. This paper investigates the simulation\nof turbulent flow with a gas- kinetic scheme. In so doing, the modeling of\nturbulence becomes part of the numerical scheme: the degree of rarefaction is\nautomatically taken into account; the turbulent stress tensor is not\nconstrained into a linear relation with the strain rate. Instead it is modeled\non the basis of the analogy between particles and eddies, without any as-\nsumptions on the type of turbulence or flow class. The implementation of a\nturbulent gas-kinetic scheme into a finite-volume solver is put forward, with\nturbulent kinetic energy and dissipation supplied by an allied turbulence\nmodel. A number of flow cases, challenging for conventional RANS methods, are\ninvestigated; results show that the shock-turbulent boundary layer is captured\nin a much more convincing way by the gas-kinetic scheme.\n", "  In this paper we perform a numerical study of the spectra, eigenstates, and\nLyapunov exponents of the skew-shift counterpart to Harper's equation. This\nstudy is motivated by various conjectures on the spectral theory of these\n'pseudo-random' models, which are reviewed in detail in the initial sections of\nthe paper. The numerics carried out at different scales are within agreement\nwith the conjectures and show a striking difference compared with the spectral\nfeatures of the Almost Mathieu model. In particular our numerics establish a\nsmall upper bound on the gaps in the spectrum (conjectured to be absent).\n", "  High energy particles' behavior including fusion born alpha particles in an\nITER like tokamak in the presence of background driftwave turbulence is\ninvestigated by an orbit following calculation. The background turbulence is\ngiven by the toroidal driftwave eigenmode combined with a random number\ngenerator. The transport level is reduced as the particle energy increase; the\nwidths of the guiding center islands produced by the passing particles are\ninverse proportional to the square root of parallel velocities. On the other\nhand, the trapped particles are sensitive to $E \\times B$ drift at the banana\ntips whose radial displacement is larger for lower energy particles. Coulomb\ncollisional effects are incorporated which modifies the transport process of\nthe trapped high energy particles whose radial excursion resides in limited\nradial domains without collisions.\n", "  We investigate common-noise-induced phase synchronization between uncoupled\nidentical Hele-Shaw cells exhibiting oscillatory convection. Using the phase\ndescription method for oscillatory convection, we demonstrate that the\nuncoupled systems of oscillatory Hele-Shaw convection can exhibit in-phase\nsynchronization when driven by weak common noise. We derive the Lyapunov\nexponent determining the relaxation time for the synchronization, and develop a\nmethod for obtaining the optimal spatial pattern of the common noise to achieve\nsynchronization. The theoretical results are confirmed by direct numerical\nsimulations.\n", "  The ghost interference observed for entangled photons is theoretically\nanalyzed using wave-packet dynamics. It is shown that ghost interference is a\ncombined effect of virtual double-slit creation due to entanglement, and\nquantum erasure of which-path information for the interfering photon. For the\ncase where the two photons are of different color, it is shown that fringe\nwidth of the interfering photon depends not only on its own wavelength, but\nalso on the wavelength of the other photon which it is entangled with.\n", "  Vulnerabilities and imperfections of single-photon detectors have been shown\nto compromise security for quantum key distribution (QKD). The\nmeasurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD) appears to be the most appealing\nsolution to solve the issues. However, in practice one faces severe obstacles\nof having significantly lower key generation rate, difficult two photon\ninterferences, and remote synchronization etc. In this letter, we propose a\nhighly efficient and simple quantum key distribution scheme to remove all of\nthese drawbacks. Our proposal can be implemented with only small modifications\nover the standard decoy BB84 system. Remarkably it enjoys both the advantages\nof high key generation rate (being almost two orders of magnitude higher than\nthat based on conventional MDI-QKD) comparable to the normal decoy system, and\nsecurity against any detector side channel attacks. Most favorably one can\nachieve complete Bell state measurements with resort to single photon\ninterference, which reduces significantly experimental costs. Our approach\nenables utilization of high speed and efficient secure communication,\nparticularly in real-life scenario of both metropolitan and intercity QKD\nnetwork, with an attack free fashion from arbitrary detector side channels.\n", "  We present a comprehensive theory on the formation of ball lightning, a\nluminous sphere sometimes observed after normal lightning. In a ball lightning\nevent, a relativistic electron bunch can be produced by the stepped leader of\nlightning and coherently emit high-power microwave when striking the ground.\nThe intense microwave ionizes the local air and evacuates the resulting plasma\nby its radiation pressure, thereby forming a spherical plasma cavity that traps\nthe microwave. The theory can explain observed properties of ball lightning and\nshould be useful to lightning protection and aviation safety.\n", "  A study using UrQMD is presented concerning the higher moments of net protons\nfrom Au+Au collisions at 7.7, 11.5, 14.6, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4, and 200 GeV,\nconcentrating on $C_{4}/C_{2} = \\kappa\\sigma^{2}$. Higher moments of net\nprotons are predicted to be a sensitive probe of the critical point of QCD. At\nthe QCD critical point, particular ratios of the moments of net protons are\npredicted to differ from the Poisson baseline. Recently STAR has published the\nhigher moments of net protons for Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ =\n7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27, 39, 62.4, and 200 GeV. UrQMD quantitatively reproduces\nSTAR's measured $C_{4}/C_{2} = \\kappa\\sigma^{2}$ for net protons for all Au+Au\ncollisions more central than 30\\% and at all centralities for $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm\nNN}}$ = 7.7 and 11.5 GeV. The effects are investigated of three different\ncentrality definitions on the values of $C_{4}/C_{2} = \\kappa\\sigma^{2}$ from\nUrQMD calculations including the impact parameter given by UrQMD. It is shown\nthat using a centrality definition based on multiplicity to calculate the\nhigher moments of net protons gives a biased answer for $C_{4}/C_{2} =\n\\kappa\\sigma^{2}$, except in the most central bin (0-5\\%).\n", "  We study the effect of finite 't Hooft coupling corrections on the imaginary\npotential and the thermal width of a moving heavy quarkonium from the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. To study these corrections, we consider $\\mathcal{R}^4$ terms\nand Gauss$-$Bonnet gravity. We conclude that the imaginary potential of a\nmoving or static heavy quarkonium starts to be generated for smaller distances\nof quark and antiquark. Similar to the case of static heavy quarkonium, it is\nshown that by considering the corrections the thermal width becomes effectively\nsmaller. The results are compared with analogous calculations in a weakly\ncoupled plasma.\n", "  The top-seesaw assisted technicolor (TC) model, which was proposed recently\nto explain the 126 GeV Higgs mass discovered by the Large Hadron Colliders\n(LHC), predicts light and heavy charged Higgs bosons in addition to the neutral\nHiggses. In this paper we will study the pair productions of the charged Higgs,\nproceeding through gluon-gluon fusion and quark-anti-quark annihilation, at the\nLHC in the frame of the top-seesaw assisted TC model. We find that in a large\npart of parameter space the production cross sections of the light charged\nHiggs pair at the LHC can be quite large compared with the low standard model\nbackgrounds, while it is impossible for the pair production of the heavy ones\nto be detected with the strong final mass suppression. Therefore, at the LHC\nfuture experiments, the light charged Higgs pair production may be served as a\nprobe of this new TC model.\n", "  Dark Stars are stellar objects made (almost entirely) of hydrogen and helium,\nbut powered by the heat from Dark Matter annihilation, rather than by fusion.\nThey are in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium, but with an unusual power\nsource. Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), among the best candidates\nfor dark matter, can be their own antimatter and can annihilate inside the\nstar, thereby providing a heat source. Although dark matter constitutes only\n$\\lesssim 0.1\\%$ of the stellar mass, this amount is sufficient to power the\nstar for millions to billions of years. Thus, the first phase of stellar\nevolution in the history of the Universe may have been dark stars. We review\nhow dark stars come into existence, how they grow as long as dark matter fuel\npersists, and their stellar structure and evolution. The studies were done in\ntwo different ways, first assuming polytropic interiors and more recently using\nthe MESA stellar evolution code; the basic results are the same. Dark stars are\ngiant, puffy ($\\sim$ 10 AU) and cool (surface temperatures $\\sim$10,000 K)\nobjects. We follow the evolution of dark stars from their inception at $\\sim 1\nM_\\odot$ as they accrete mass from their surroundings to become supermassive\nstars, some even reaching masses $> 10^6 M_\\odot$ and luminosities $>10^{10}\nL_\\odot$, making them detectable with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.\nOnce the dark matter runs out and the dark star dies, it may collapse to a\nblack hole; thus dark stars may provide seeds for the supermassive black holes\nobserved throughout the Universe and at early times. Other sites for dark star\nformation may exist in the Universe today in regions of high dark matter\ndensity such as the centers of galaxies. The current review briefly discusses\ndark stars existing today, but focuses on the early generation of dark stars.\n", "  We present a physical methodology to reconstruct the trajectory of\ninterplanetary shocks using type II radio emission data. This technique\ncalculates the shock trajectory assuming that the disturbance propagates as a\nblast wave in the interplanetary medium. We applied this Blast Wave\nReconstruction (BWR) technique to analyze eight fast Earth-directed\nICMEs/shocks associated with type II emissions. The technique deduces a shock\ntrajectory that reproduces the type II frequency drifts, and calculates shock\nonset speed, shock transit time and shock speed at 1 AU. There were good\nagreements comparing the BWR results with the type II spectra, with data from\ncoronagraph images, in situ measurements, and interplanetary scintillation\n(IPS) observations. Perturbations on the type II data affect the accuracy of\nthe BWR technique. This methodology could be applied to track interplanetary\nshocks causing TII emissions in real-time, to predict the shock arrival time\nand shock speed at 1 AU.\n", "  Quantum discord expresses a fundamental non-classicality of correlations more\ngeneral than quantum entanglement. We combine the no-local-broadcasting\ntheorem, semidefinite-programming characterizations of quantum fidelity and\nquantum separability, and a recent breakthrough result of Fawzi and Renner\nabout quantum Markov chains to provide a hierarchy of computationally efficient\nlower bounds to quantum discord. Such a hierarchy converges to the surprisal of\nmeasurement recoverability introduced by Seshadreesan and Wilde, and provides a\nfaithful lower bound to quantum discord already at the lowest non-trivial\nlevel. Furthermore, the latter constitutes by itself a valid discord-like\nmeasure of the quantumness of correlations.\n", "  This paper introduces a class of polynomial maps in Euclidean spaces,\ninvestigates the conditions under which there exist Smale horseshoes and\nuniformly hyperbolic invariant sets, studies the chaotic dynamical behavior and\nstrange attractors, and shows that some maps are chaotic in the sense of\nLi-Yorke or Devaney. This type of maps includes both the Logistic map and the\nH\\'{e}non map. For some maps in three-dimensional spaces under certain\nconditions, if the expansion dimension is equal to one or two, it is shown that\nthere exist a Smale horseshoe and a uniformly hyperbolic invariant set on which\nthe system is topologically conjugate to the two-sided fullshift on finite\nalphabet; if the system is expanding, then it is verified that there is an\nforward invariant set on which the system is topologically semi-conjugate to\nthe one-sided fullshift on eight symbols. For three types of high-dimensional\npolynomial maps with degree two, the existence of Smale horseshoe and the\nuniformly hyperbolic invariant sets are studied, and it is proved that the map\nis topologically conjugate to the two-sided fullshift on finite alphabet on the\ninvariant set under certain conditions. Some interesting maps with chaotic\nattractors and positive Lyapunov exponents in three-dimensional spaces are\nfound by using computer simulations. In the end, two examples are provided to\nillustrate the theoretical results.\n", "  The influence of short-range correlations (SRC) on the spectral distribution\nof neutrons is incorporated in the solution of the gap equation for the\n${}^3P_2-{}^3F_2$ coupled channel in pure neutron matter at high density. This\neffect is studied for three different realistic interactions. The gap in this\nchannel is strongly suppressed by these correlations but does not vanish. For a\nconsistent treatment we also include for the first time the effect of\nlong-range correlations (LRC) by incorporating polarization terms in addition\nto the bare interaction. This allows the neutrons to exchange density and spin\nfluctuations governed by the strength of Landau parameters with values that are\nconsistent with the available literature. While these LRC have an antiscreening\ntendency, they only slightly increase the gap in the ${}^3P_2-{}^3F_2$ coupled\nchannel for all three realistic interactions as long as SRC are included. All\nthree interactions generate maximum gaps around 0.1 to 0.2 MeV at most with a\nsmall dependence on the hardness of the interaction. These results are relevant\nfor the cooling scenarios of neutron stars, in particular the young neutron\nstar in Cassiopeia A.\n", "  In this paper a lower bound for the ADM mass is given in terms of the angular\nmomenta and charges of black holes present in axisymmetric initial data sets\nfor the Einstein-Maxwell equations. This generalizes the mass-angular\nmomentum-charge inequality obtained by Chrusciel and Costa to the case of\nmultiple black holes. We also weaken the hypotheses used in the proof of this\nresult for single black holes, and establish the associated rigidity statement.\n", "  We use the Hirsch-Fye quantum Monte Carlo method to study the single magnetic\nimpurity problem in a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling. We calculate the spin susceptibility for various values of spin-orbit\ncoupling, Hubbard interaction, and chemical potential. The Kondo temperatures\nfor different parameters are estimated by fitting the universal curves of spin\nsusceptibility. We find that the Kondo temperature is almost a linear function\nof Rashba spin-orbit energy when the chemical potential is close to the edge of\nthe conduction band. When the chemical potential is far away from the band\nedge, the Kondo temperature is independent of the spin-orbit coupling. These\nresults demonstrate that, for single impurity problem in this system, the most\nimportant reason to change the Kondo temperature is the divergence of density\nof states near the band edge, and the divergence is induced by the Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling.\n", "  We present the results of a novel Mossbauer experiment in a rotating system,\nimplemented recently in Istanbul University, which yields the coefficient\nk=0.69+/-0.02 within the frame of the expression for the relative energy shift\nbetween emission and absorption lines dE/E=ku2/c2. This result turned out to be\nin a quantitative agreement with an experiment achieved earlier on the subject\nmatter (A.L. Kholmetskii et al. 2009 Phys. Scr. 79 065007), and once again\nstrongly pointed to the inequality k>0.5, revealed originally in (A.L.\nKholmetskii et al. 2008 Phys. Scr. 77, 035302 (2008)) via the re-analysis of\nKundig experiment (W. Kundig. Phys. Rev. 129, 2371 (1963)). A possible\nexplanation of the deviation of the coefficient k from the relativistic\nprediction k=0.5 is discussed.\n", "  The constituent parts of a quantum computer are inherently vulnerable to\nerrors. To this end we have developed quantum error-correcting codes to protect\nquantum information from noise. However, discovering codes that are capable of\na universal set of computational operations with the minimal cost in quantum\nresources remains an important and ongoing challenge. One proposal of\nsignificant recent interest is the gauge color code. Notably, this code may\noffer a reduced resource cost over other well-studied fault-tolerant\narchitectures using a new method, known as gauge fixing, for performing the\nnon-Clifford logical operations that are essential for universal quantum\ncomputation. Here we examine the gauge color code when it is subject to noise.\nSpecifically we make use of single-shot error correction to develop a simple\ndecoding algorithm for the gauge color code, and we numerically analyse its\nperformance. Remarkably, we find threshold error rates comparable to those of\nother leading proposals. Our results thus provide encouraging preliminary data\nof a comparative study between the gauge color code and other promising\ncomputational architectures.\n", "  The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) has established itself as a valid\nnumerical method in computational fluid dynamics. Recently,\nmultiple-relaxation-time LBM has been proposed to simulate anisotropic\nadvection-diffusion processes. The governing differential equations of\nadvective-diffusive systems are known to satisfy maximum principles, comparison\nprinciples, the non-negative constraint, and the decay property. In this paper,\nit will be shown that current single- and multiple-relaxation-time lattice\nBoltzmann methods fail to preserve these mathematical properties for transient\ndiffusion-type equations. It will also be shown that the discretization of\nDirichlet boundary conditions will affect the performance of lattice Boltzmann\nmethods in meeting these mathematical principles. A new way of discretizing the\nDirichlet boundary conditions is also proposed. Several benchmark problems have\nbeen solved to illustrate the performance of lattice Boltzmann methods and the\neffect of discretization of boundary conditions with respect to the\naforementioned mathematical properties for transient diffusion and\nadvection-diffusion equations.\n", "  A direct-detection Brillouin optical time-domain reflectometry (BOTDR) is\nproposed and demonstrated by using an up-conversion single-photon detector and\na fiber Fabry-Perot scanning interferometer (FFP-SI). Taking advantage of high\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the detector and high spectrum resolution of the\nFFP-SI, the Brillouin spectrum along a polarization maintaining fiber (PMF) is\nrecorded on a multiscaler with a small data size directly. In contrast with\nconventional BOTDR adopting coherent detection, photon-counting BOTDR is\nsimpler in structure and easier in data processing. In the demonstration\nexperiment, characteristic parameters of the Brillouin spectrum including its\npower, spectral width and frequency center are analyzed simultaneously along a\n10 km PMF at different temperature and stain conditions.\n", "  We report narrow linewidth optomechanical oscillation of a silica microsphere\nimmersed in a buffer solution. Through a novel optomechanical transduction\nsensing approach, single 10-nm-radius silica beads and Bovine serum albumin\n(BSA) protein molecules with a molecular weight of 66 kDalton were detected.\nThis approach predicts the detection of 3.9 kDalton single molecules at a\nsignal-to-noise ration above unity.\n", "  The properties of the entanglement entropy (EE) of a clean Cayley tree (CT)\nare studied. The EE shows a completely different behaviour depending on the way\nthe CT is partitioned into two regions and whether we consider the ground-state\nor highly excited many-particle wave function. The ground-state EE increases\nlogarithmically as function of number of generation if a single branch is\npruned off the tree, while it grows exponentially if the region around the root\nis trimmed. On the other hand, in both cases the highly excited states' EE\ngrows exponentially. Implications of these results to general graphs and\ndisordered systems are shortly discussed.\n", "  We establish a general framework for the analysis of boundary value problems\nof matrix models at zero energy on compact regions. We derive existence and\nuniqueness of ground state wavefunctions for the mass operator of the $D=11$\nregularized supermembrane theory, that is the $\\mathcal{N}=16$ supersymmetric\n$SU(N)$ matrix model, on balls of finite radius. Our results rely on the\nstructure of the associated Dirichlet form and a factorization in terms of the\nsupersymmetric charges. They also rely on the polynomial structure of the\npotential and various other supersymmetric properties of the system.\n", "  We propose the Gaussian quadrature inference (GQI) method for multicarrier\ncontinuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD). A multicarrier CVQKD\nprotocol utilizes Gaussian subcarrier quantum continuous variables (CV) for\ninformation transmission. The GQI framework provides a minimal error estimate\nof the quadratures of the CV quantum states from the discrete, measured noisy\nsubcarrier variables. GQI utilizes the fundamentals of regularization theory\nand statistical information processing. We characterize GQI for multicarrier\nCVQKD, and define a method for the statistical modeling and processing of noisy\nGaussian subcarrier quadratures. We demonstrate the results through the\nadaptive multicarrier quadrature division (AMQD) scheme. We define direct GQI\n(DGQI), and prove that it achieves a theoretical minimal magnitude error. We\nintroduce the terms statistical secret key rate and statistical private\nclassical information, which quantities are derived purely by the statistical\nfunctions of GQI. We prove the secret key rate formulas for a multiple access\nmulticarrier CVQKD via the AMQD-MQA (multiuser quadrature allocation) scheme.\nThe GQI and DGQI frameworks can be established in an arbitrary CVQKD protocol\nand measurement setting, and are implementable by standard low-complexity\nstatistical functions, which is particularly convenient for an experimental\nCVQKD scenario.\n", "  For a projection-based reduced order model (ROM) of a fluid flow to be stable\nand accurate, the dynamics of the truncated subspace must be taken into\naccount. This paper proposes an approach for stabilizing and enhancing\nprojection-based fluid ROMs in which truncated modes are accounted for a priori\nvia a minimal rotation of the projection subspace. Attention is focused on the\nfull non-linear compressible Navier-Stokes equations in specific volume form as\na step toward a more general formulation for problems with generic\nnon-linearities. Unlike traditional approaches, no empirical turbulence\nmodeling terms are required, and consistency between the ROM and the full order\nmodel from which the ROM is derived is maintained. Mathematically, the approach\nis formulated as a trace minimization problem on the Stiefel manifold. The\nreproductive as well as predictive capabilities of the method are evaluated on\nseveral compressible flow problems, including a problem involving laminar flow\nover an airfoil with a high angle of attack, and a channel-driven cavity flow\nproblem.\n", "  A simple, causal, and analytic model of final state rescattering is used to\ndescribe all available data on the exotic resonances $Z_c(3900)$ and\n$Z_c(4025)$. The model provides a compelling and accurate representation of\nexperiment with no need for poles in the scattering matrix.\n", "  We use the class of commuting quantum computations known as IQP\n(Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial time) to strengthen the conjecture that\nquantum computers are hard to simulate classically. We show that, if either of\ntwo plausible average-case hardness conjectures holds, then IQP computations\nare hard to simulate classically up to constant additive error. One conjecture\nrelates to the hardness of estimating the complex-temperature partition\nfunction for random instances of the Ising model; the other concerns\napproximating the number of zeroes of random low-degree polynomials. We observe\nthat both conjectures can be shown to be valid in the setting of worst-case\ncomplexity. We arrive at these conjectures by deriving spin-based\ngeneralisations of the Boson Sampling problem that avoid the so-called\npermanent anticoncentration conjecture.\n", "  A new type of the Multi-Pixel Photon Counter (MPPC), sensitive to Vacuum\nUltra-Violet (VUV) light (wavelength {\\lambda} < 150 nm), is recently developed\nand produced by Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. The basic properties of the new MPPC\nare measured at cryogenic facility of Waseda university using liquid nitrogen.\nTemperature dependence of breakdown voltage, capacitance, and dark count rate\nof the MPPC are also evaluated. In addition, the absolute photon detection\nefficiency (PDE) for liquid argon (LAr) scintillation light ({\\lambda} = 128\nnm) is estimated to be about 7% with uncertainty of 2% by using 241 Am\n{\\alpha}-ray source. Based on these basic measurements a possible application\nof the new MPPC to LAr detector for dark matter search is discussed.\n", "  In this letter, we show that asymmetric transmission of circularly polarized\nwaves through a nanostructured planar chiral graphene film can be observed in\nterahertz range. The asymmetric transmission effect of monatomic layer graphene\nclosely resembles that of metallic planar chiral nanostructures which has\npreviously been demonstrated. And the relative enantiomeric difference in the\ntotal transmission varies with the change of graphene's Fermi level. The\nplasmonic excitation in the graphene nanostructure is the enantiometically\nsensitive which is asymmetric for opposite propagating directions. This\nphenomenon will deepen our understanding of light-matter interactions in planar\nchiral structures and may find applications in polarization-sensitive devices,\nsensors, detectors and other areas.\n", "  In this paper we note that the spectral intensities of antiprotons observed\nin Galactic cosmic rays in the energy range ~ 1-100 GeV by BESS, PAMELA and AMS\ninstruments display nearly the same spectral shape as that generated by primary\ncosmic rays through their interaction with matter in the interstellar medium,\nwithout any significant modifications. More importantly, a constant residence\ntime of ~ 2.5 +/-0.7 million years in the Galactic volume, independent of the\nenergy of cosmic rays, matches the observed intensities. A small additional\ncomponent of secondary antiprotons in the energy below 10 GeV, generated in\ncocoon-like regions surrounding the cosmic-ray sources, seems to be present. We\ndiscuss this result in the context of observations of other secondary\ncomponents like positrons and Boron, and conclude with general remarks about\nthe origins and propagation of cosmic rays.\n", "  We analyze how the performance of a quantum-repeater network depends on the\nprotocol employed to distribute entanglement, and we find that the choice of\nrepeater-to-repeater link protocol has a profound impact on communication rate\nas a function of hardware parameters. We develop numerical simulations of\nquantum networks using different protocols, where the repeater hardware is\nmodeled in terms of key performance parameters, such as photon generation rate\nand collection efficiency. These parameters are motivated by recent\nexperimental demonstrations in quantum dots, trapped ions, and nitrogen-vacancy\ncenters in diamond. We find that a quantum-dot repeater with the newest\nprotocol (\"MidpointSource\") delivers the highest communication rate when there\nis low probability of establishing entanglement per transmission, and in some\ncases the rate is orders of magnitude higher than other schemes. Our simulation\ntools can be used to evaluate communication protocols as part of designing a\nlarge-scale quantum network.\n", "  It is experimentally shown that the pressure applied along the twofold\nsymmetry axis of a heterostructure with a wide GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well leads\nto considerable modification of the polariton reflectance spectra. This effect\nis treated as the stress-induced decrease of the heavy-hole exciton mass.\nTheoretical modeling of the effect supports this assumption. The 5\\%-decrease\nof the exciton mass is obtained at pressure P=0.23 GPa.\n", "  We obtain a reduction scheme for the study of the quantum evolution of an\natom in constant magnetic fields using the method developed by Martinez, Nenciu\nand Sordoni based on the construction of almost invariant subspace. In\nMartinez-Sordoni \\cite{MaSo2} such a case is also studied but their reduced\nHamiltonian includes the vector potential terms. In this paper, using the\ncenter of mass coordinates and constructing the almost invariant subspace\ndifferent from theirs, we obtain the reduced Hamiltonian which does not include\nthe vector potential terms. Using the reduced evolution we also obtain the\nasymptotic expantion of the evolution for a specific localized initial data,\nwhich verifies the straight motion of an atom in constatnt magnetic fields.\n", "  Using exact formulae for the scattering data of the Benjamin-Ono equation\nvalid for general rational potentials recently obtained by Miller and Wetzel\n(2015), we rigorously analyze the scattering data in the small-dispersion\nlimit. In particular, we deduce precise asymptotic formulae for the reflection\ncoefficient, the location of the eigenvalues and their density, and the\nasymptotic dependence of the phase constant (associated with each eigenvalue)\non the eigenvalue itself. Our results give direct confirmation of conjectures\nin the literature that have been partly justified by means of inverse\nscattering, and they also provide new details not previously reported in the\nliterature.\n", "  In this paper we analyze a two-dimensional discrete model of\nnearest-neighbour Lennard-Jones interactions under the microscopical constraint\nthat points on a lattice triangle maintain their order. This can be understood\nas a microscopical non-interpenetration constraint and amounts to the\npositiveness of the determinant of the gradient of the piecewise-affine\ninterpolations of the discrete displacement. Under such a constraint we examine\nthe continuum fracture energy deriving from a discrete-to-continuum analysis at\na scaling where surface energy is preponderant. We give a lower bound by an\nanisotropic Griffith energy. This bound is optimal if the macroscopic\ndisplacement satisfies some opening-crack conditions on the fracture site. We\nshow that if such conditions are not satisfied then the computation of the\nenergy due to continuum cracks may involve non-local effects necessary to\nbypass the positive-determinant constraint on crack surfaces and at points\nwhere more cracks meet. Even when the limit fracture energy may be described by\na surface energy density, this may depend on the crack orientation both in the\nreference and in the deformed configuration. While these effects lead to very\ninteresting analytical issues, they call into question the necessity of the\ndeterminant constraint for fracture problems.\n", "  Pair-separation statistics of in-situ and synthetic surface drifters deployed\nnear the \\emph{Deepwater Horizon} site in the Gulf of Mexico are investigated.\nThe synthetic trajectories derive from a 1-km-resolution data-assimilative Navy\nCoastal Ocean Model (NCOM) simulation. The in-situ drifters were launched in\nthe Grand LAgrangian Deployment (GLAD). Diverse measures of the dispersion are\ncalculated and compared to theoretical predictions. For the NCOM pairs, the\nmeasures indicate nonlocal pair dispersion at the smallest sampled scales. At\nseparations exceeding 100 km, pair motion is uncorrelated, indicating absolute\nrather than relative dispersion. With the GLAD drifters however the statistics\nsuggest local dispersion (in which pair separations exhibit power law growth),\nin line with previous findings. The disagreement stems in part from inertial\noscillations, which affect the energy levels at small scales without greatly\naltering the net particle displacements. They were significant in GLAD but much\nweaker in the NCOM simulations. In addition the GLAD drifters were launched\nclose together, producing few independent realizations and hence weaker\nstatistical significance. Restricting the NCOM set to those launched at the\nsame locations yields very similar statistics.\n", "  An influential result of F. John states that no genuinely non-linear strictly\nhyperbolic quasi-linear first order system of partial differential equations in\ntwo variables has a global $C^2$-solution for small enough initial data.\nInspired by recent work of D. Christodoulou, we revisit John's original proof\nand extract a more precise description of the behaviour of solutions at the\ntime of shock. We show that John's singular first order quantity, when\nexpressed in characteristic coordinates, remains bounded until the final time,\nwhich is then characterised by an inverse density of characteristics tending to\nzero in one point. Moreover, we study the derivatives of second order, showing\nagain their boundedness when expressed in appropriate coordinates. We also\nrecover John's upper bound for the time of shock formation and complement it\nwith a lower bound. Finally, we apply these results to electromagnetic plane\nwaves in a crystal with no magnetic properties and cubic electric non-linearity\nin the energy density, assuming no dispersion.\n", "  Recent experiments on the bacterial flagellar motor have shown that the\nstructure of this nanomachine, which drives locomotion in a wide range of\nbacterial species, is more dynamic than previously believed. Specifically, the\nnumber of active torque-generating units (stators) was shown to vary across\napplied loads. This finding invalidates the experimental evidence reporting\nthat limiting (zero-torque) speed is independent of the number of active\nstators. Here, we propose that, contrary to previous assumptions, the maximum\nspeed of the motor is not universal, but rather increases as additional\ntorque-generators are recruited. This result arises from our assumption that\nstators disengage from the motor for a significant portion of their\nmechanochemical cycles at low loads. We show that this assumption is consistent\nwith current experimental evidence and consolidate our predictions with\narguments that a processive motor must have a high duty ratio at high loads.\n", "  We study general dynamical equations describing homogeneous isotropic\ncosmologies coupled to a scalaron $\\psi$. For flat cosmologies ($k=0$), we\nanalyze in detail the gauge-independent equation describing the differential,\n$\\chi(\\alpha)\\equiv\\psi^\\prime(\\alpha)$, of the map of the metric $\\alpha$ to\nthe scalaron field $\\psi$, which is the main mathematical characteristic\nlocally defining a `portrait' of a cosmology in `$\\alpha$-version'. In the\n`$\\psi$-version', a similar equation for the differential of the inverse map,\n$\\bar{\\chi}(\\psi)\\equiv \\chi^{-1}(\\alpha)$, can be solved asymptotically or for\nsome `integrable' scalaron potentials $v(\\psi)$. In the flat case,\n$\\bar{\\chi}(\\psi)$ and $\\chi(\\alpha)$ satisfy the first-order differential\nequations depending only on the logarithmic derivative of the potential. Once\nwe know a general analytic solution for one of these $\\chi$-functions, we can\nexplicitly derive all characteristics of the cosmological model. In the\n$\\alpha$-version, the whole dynamical system is integrable for $k\\neq 0$ and\nwith any `$\\alpha$-potential', $\\bar{v}(\\alpha)\\equiv v[\\psi(\\alpha)]$,\nreplacing $v(\\psi)$. There is no a priori relation between the two potentials\nbefore deriving $\\chi$ or $\\bar{\\chi}$, which implicitly depend on the\npotential itself, but relations between the two pictures can be found by\nasymptotic expansions or by inflationary perturbation theory. Explicit\napplications of the results to a more rigorous treatment of the chaotic\ninflation models and to their comparison with the ekpyrotic-bouncing ones are\noutlined in the frame of our `$\\alpha$-formulation' of isotropic scalaron\ncosmologies. In particular, we establish an inflationary perturbation expansion\nfor $\\chi$. When all the conditions for inflation are satisfied and $\\chi$\nobeys a certain boundary (initial) condition, we get the standard inflationary\nparameters, with higher-order corrections.\n", "  The simplest theories often have much merit and many limitations, and in this\nvein, the value of Neutral Theory (NT) has been the subject of much debate over\nthe past 15 years. NT was proposed at the turn of the century by Stephen\nHubbell to explain pervasive patterns observed in the organization of\necosystems. Its originally tepid reception among ecologists contrasted starkly\nwith the excitement it caused among physicists and mathematicians. Indeed, NT\nspawned several theoretical studies that attempted to explain empirical data\nand predicted trends of quantities that had not yet been studied. While there\nare a few reviews of NT oriented towards ecologists, our goal here is to review\nthe quantitative results of NT and its extensions for physicists who are\ninterested in learning what NT is, what its successes are and what important\nproblems remain unresolved. Furthermore, we hope that this review could also be\nof interest to theoretical ecologists because many potentially interesting\nresults are buried in the vast NT literature. We propose to make these more\naccessible by extracting them and presenting them in a logical fashion. We\nconclude the review by discussing how one might introduce realistic non-neutral\nelements into the current models.\n", "  We study deformations of two-component non semisimple Poisson pencils of\nhydrodynamic type associated with Balinski\\v{\\i}-Novikov algebras. We show that\nin most cases the second order deformations are parametrized by two functions\nof a single variable. It turns out that one function is invariant with respect\nto the subgroup of Miura transformations preserving the dispersionless limit\nand another function is related to a one-parameter family of truncated\nstructures. In two expectional cases the second order deformations are\nparametrized by four functions. Among them two are invariants and two are\nrelated to a two-parameter family of truncated structures. We also study the\nlift of deformations of n-component semisimple structures. This example\nsuggests that deformations of non semisimple pencils corresponding to the\nlifted invariant parameters are unobstructed.\n", "  QSO near-zones are an important probe of the the ionization state of the IGM\nat z ~ 6-7, at the end of reionization. We present here high-resolution\ncosmological 3D radiative transfer simulations of QSO environments for a wide\nrange of host halo masses, 10$^{10-12.5}$ M_sun. Our simulated near-zones\nreproduce both the overall decrease of observed near-zone sizes at 6 < z < 7\nand their scatter. The observable near-zone properties in our simulations\ndepend only very weakly on the mass of the host halo. The size of the H II\nregion expanding into the IGM is generally limited by (super-)Lyman Limit\nsystems loosely associated with (low-mass) dark matter haloes. This leads to a\nstrong dependence of near-zone size on direction and drives the large observed\nscatter. In the simulation centred on our most massive host halo, many\nsightlines show strong red damping wings even for initial volume averaged\nneutral hydrogen fractions as low as ~ 10$^{-3}$. For QSO lifetimes long enough\nto allow growth of the central supermassive black hole while optically bright,\nwe can reproduce the observed near-zone of ULAS J1120+0641 only with an IGM\nthat is initially neutral. Our results suggest that larger samples of z > 7\nQSOs will provide important constraints on the evolution of the neutral\nhydrogen fraction and thus on how late reionization ends.\n", "  The effect of the anisotropy in the exchange interaction and film thickness\non the hysteresis behavior of the anisotropic Heisenberg thin film has been\ninvestigated with effective field formulation in a two spin cluster using the\ndecoupling approximation. The behaviors of the hysteresis loop area, coersive\nfield and remanent magnetization with the film thickness and anisotropy in the\nexchange interaction have been obtained.\n", "  The experimental binding energies of single-particle and single-hole neutron\nstates belonging to neutron shells that extend from N = 126 to 184 and 82 to\n126 respectively, have been reproduced by solving the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation\nwith a potential that has two components: the generalized Woods-Saxon (GWS)\npotential and the spin-orbit (SO) coupling term. The GWS potential contains the\ntraditional WS potential plus a term (SU) whose intensity reaches a maximum in\nthe nuclear surface. Our results indicate the existence of a explicit\nrelationship between the strength of the SU potential and the orbital angular\nmomentum quantum number $\\ell$ of the state. This dependence has been used to\nmake reasonable predictions for the excitation energy centroids of states\nlocated inside and outside the neutron shells investigated. Comparisons are\nmade with results reported in previous investigations.\n", "  Many boundary element integral equation kernels are based on the Green's\nfunctions of the Laplace and Helmholtz equations in three dimensions. These\ninclude, for example, the Laplace, Helmholtz, elasticity, Stokes, and Maxwell's\nequations. Integral equation formulations lead to more compact, but dense\nlinear systems. These dense systems are often solved iteratively via Krylov\nsubspace methods, which may be accelerated via the fast multipole method. There\nare advantages to Galerkin formulations for such integral equations, as they\ntreat problems associated with kernel singularity, and lead to symmetric and\nbetter conditioned matrices. However, the Galerkin method requires each entry\nin the system matrix to be created via the computation of a double surface\nintegral over one or more pairs of triangles. There are a number of\nsemi-analytical methods to treat these integrals, which all have some issues,\nand are discussed in this paper. We present novel methods to compute all the\nintegrals that arise in Galerkin formulations involving kernels based on the\nLaplace and Helmholtz Green's functions to any specified accuracy. Integrals\ninvolving completely geometrically separated triangles are non-singular and are\ncomputed using a technique based on spherical harmonics and multipole\nexpansions and translations, which results in the integration of polynomial\nfunctions over the triangles. Integrals involving cases where the triangles\nhave common vertices, edges, or are coincident are treated via scaling and\nsymmetry arguments, combined with automatic recursive geometric decomposition\nof the integrals. Example results are presented, and the developed software is\navailable as open source.\n", "  In search of extra dimensions in the ongoing LHC experiments, signatures of\nRandall-Sundrum (RS) lightest KK graviton have been one of the main focus in\nrecent years. The recent data from the dilepton decay channel at the LHC has\ndetermined the experimental lower bound on the mass of the RS lightest\nKaluza-Klein (KK) graviton for different choices of underlying parameters of\nthe theory. In this work we explore the effects of the backreaction of the bulk\nscalar field, which is employed to stabilise the RS model, in modifying the\ncouplings of the lightest KK graviton with the standard model (SM) matter\nfields located on the visible brane. In such a modified background geometry we\nshow that the coupling of the lightest KK graviton with the SM matter fields\ngets a significant suppression due to the inclusion of the backreaction of the\nbulk stabilising scalar field. This implies that the backreaction parameter\nweakens the signals from RS scenario in collider experiments which in turn\nexplains the non-visibility of KK graviton in colliders. Thus we show that the\nmodulus stabilisation plays a crucial role in the search of warped extra\ndimensions in collider experiments.\n", "  Rotation of non-circular hydraulic jumps is a recent experimental observation\nthat lacks a theory based on first principles. Here we furnish a basic theory\nof this phenomenon founded on the shallow-water model of the circular hydraulic\njump. The breaking of the axial symmetry morphs the circular jump into a\npolygonal state. Variations on this state rotate the polygon in the azimuthal\ndirection. The dependence of the rotational frequency on the flow rate and on\nthe number of polygon vertices agrees with known experimental results. We also\npredict how the rotational frequency varies with viscosity. Finally, we\nestablish a correspondence between the rotating polygonal structure and the\nHawking effect in an analogue white hole. The rotational frequency of the\npolygons affords a direct estimate of the frequency of the thermal Hawking\nradiation.\n", "  It has been recently predicted theoretically that due to nuclear motion light\nand heavy hydrogen molecules exposed to strong electric field should exhibit\nsubstantially different tunneling ionization rates (O.I. Tolstikhin, H.J.\nWorner and T. Morishita, Phys. Rev. A 87, 041401(R) (2013) [1]). We studied\nthat isotope effect experimentally by measuring relative ionization yields for\neach species in a mixed H2/D2 gas jet interacting with intense femtosecond\nlaser pulses. In a reaction microscope apparatus we detected ionic fragments\nfrom all contributing channels (single ionization, dissociation, and sequential\ndouble ionization) and determined the ratio of total single ionization yields\nfor H2 and D2. The measured ratio agrees quantitatively with the prediction of\nthe generalized weak-field asymptotic theory in an apparent failure of the\nfrozen-nuclei approximation.\n", "  We consider time delay for the Dirac equation. A new method to calculate the\nasymptotics of the expectation values of the operator $\\int\\limits_{0}\n^{\\infty}e^{iH_{0}t}\\zeta\\left( \\frac{\\left\\vert x\\right\\vert }{R}\\right)\ne^{-iH_{0}t}dt,$ as $R\\rightarrow\\infty,$ is presented. Here $H_{0}$ is the\nfree Dirac operator and $\\zeta\\left( t\\right) $ is such that $\\zeta\\left(\nt\\right) =1$ for $0\\leq t\\leq1$ and $\\zeta\\left( t\\right) =0$ for $t>1.$ This\napproach allows us to obtain the time delay operator $\\delta \\mathcal{T}\\left(\nf\\right) $ for initial states $f$ in $\\mathcal{H} _{2}^{3/2+\\varepsilon}\\left(\n\\mathbb{R}^{3};\\mathbb{C}^{4}\\right) ,$ $\\varepsilon>0,$ the Sobolev space of\norder $3/2+\\varepsilon$ and weight $2.$ The relation between the time delay\noperator $\\delta\\mathcal{T}\\left( f\\right) $ and the Eisenbud-Wigner time delay\noperator is given. Also, the relation between the averaged time delay and the\nspectral shift function is presented.\n", "  We consider the imitative monomer-dimer model on the complete graph\nintroduced in [1]. It was understood that this model is described by the\nmonomer density and has a phase transition along certain critical line. By\nreverting the model to a weighted Curie-Weiss model with hard core interaction,\nwe establish the complete description of the fluctuation properties of the\nmonomer density on the full parameter space via Stein's method of exchangeable\npairs. We show that this quantity exhibits the central limit theorem away from\nthe critical line and enjoys a non-normal limit theorem at criticality with\nnormalized exponent $3/4$. Furthermore, our approach also allows to obtain the\nconditional central limit theorems along the critical line. In all these\nresults, the Berry-Esseen inequalities for the Kolomogorov-Smirnov distance are\ngiven.\n", "  We present an analytical formulation of the recent one-shot decoupling model\nof Br\\`adler and Adami [arXiv:1505.0284] and compute the resulting \"Page\nInformation\" curves, for the reduced density matrices for the evaporating black\nhole internal degrees of freedom, and emitted Hawking radiation pairs entangled\nacross the horizon. We argue that black hole evaporation/particle production\nhas a very close analogy to the laboratory process of spontaneous parametric\ndown conversion, when the pump is allowed to deplete.\n", "  We present ANNz2, a new implementation of the public software for photometric\nredshift (photo-z) estimation of Collister and Lahav (2004), which now includes\ngeneration of full probability distribution functions (PDFs). ANNz2 utilizes\nmultiple machine learning methods, such as artificial neural networks and\nboosted decision/regression trees. The objective of the algorithm is to\noptimize the performance of the photo-z estimation, to properly derive the\nassociated uncertainties, and to produce both single-value solutions and PDFs.\nIn addition, estimators are made available, which mitigate possible problems of\nnon-representative or incomplete spectroscopic training samples. ANNz2 has\nalready been used as part of the first weak lensing analysis of the Dark Energy\nSurvey, and is included in the experiment's first public data release. Here we\nillustrate the functionality of the code using data from the tenth data release\nof the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic\nSurvey. The code is available for download at\nhttps://github.com/IftachSadeh/ANNZ .\n", "  We consider a one-step replica symmetry breaking description of the\nEdwards-Anderson spin glass model in 2D. The ingredients of this description\nare a Kikuchi approximation to the free energy and a second-level statistical\nmodel built on the extremal points of the Kikuchi approximation, which are also\nfixed points of a Generalized Belief Propagation (GBP) scheme. We show that a\ngeneralized free energy can be constructed where these extremal points are\nexponentially weighted by their Kikuchi free energy and a Parisi parameter $y$,\nand that the Kikuchi approximation of this generalized free energy leads to\nsecond-level, one-step replica symmetry breaking (1RSB), GBP equations. We then\nproceed analogously to Bethe approximation case for tree-like graphs, where it\nhas been shown that 1RSB Belief Propagation equations admit a Survey\nPropagation solution. We discuss when and how the one-step-replica symmetry\nbreaking GBP equations that we obtain also allow a simpler class of solutions\nwhich can be interpreted as a class of Generalized Survey Propagation equations\nfor the single instance graph case.\n", "  Some Physics (obtaining lattice-compatible deconfinement temperature, some\ntransport coefficients and Einstein's relation) and Mathematics (torsion\nclasses and supersymmetry) issues pertaining to the delocalized SYZ type IIA\nmirror of [1] and its M theory uplift in the MQGP limit of [2], are discussed.\n", "  The method of McCurdy, Baertschy, and Rescigno, J. Phys. B, 37, R137 (2004)\nis generalized to obtain a straightforward, surprisingly accurate, and scalable\nnumerical representation for calculating the electronic wave functions of\nmolecules. It uses a basis set of product sinc functions arrayed on a Cartesian\ngrid, and yields 1 kcal/mol precision for valence transition energies with a\ngrid resolution of approximately 0.1 bohr. The Coulomb matrix elements are\nreplaced with matrix elements obtained from the kinetic energy operator. A\nresolution-of-the-identity approximation renders the primitive one- and\ntwo-electron matrix elements diagonal; in other words, the Coulomb operator is\nlocal with respect to the grid indices. The calculation of contracted\ntwo-electron matrix elements among orbitals requires only O(N log(N))\nmultiplication operations, not O(N^4), where N is the number of basis\nfunctions; N = n^3 on cubic grids. The representation not only is numerically\nexpedient, but also produces energies and properties superior to those\ncalculated variationally. Absolute energies, absorption cross sections,\ntransition energies, and ionization potentials are reported for one- (He^+,\nH_2^+ ), two- (H_2, He), ten- (CH_4) and 56-electron (C_8H_8) systems.\n", "  We investigate the shear viscosity of thermalized photons in the quark gluon\nplasma (QGP) at weak coupling and $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills plasma\n(SYMP) at both strong and weak couplings. We find that the shear viscosity due\nto the photon-parton scattering up to the leading order of electromagnetic\ncoupling is suppressed when the coupling of the QGP/SYMP is increased, which\nstems from the blue-shift of the thermal-photon spectrum at strong coupling. In\naddition, the shear viscosity rapidly increases near the deconfinement\ntransition in a phenomenological model analogous to the QGP.\n", "  We study role of site substitutions at In and Te site in In2Te5 on the\nthermoelectric behavior. Single crystals with compositions In2(Te1-xSex)5 (x =\n0, 0.05, 0.10) and Fe0.05In1.95(Te0.90Se0.10)5 were prepared using modified\nBridgman-Stockbarger technique. Electrical and thermal transport properties of\nthese single crystals were measured in the temperature range 6 - 395 K. A\nsubstantial decrease in thermal conductivity is observed in Fe substituted\nsamples attributed to the enhanced phonon point-defect scattering. Marked\nenhancement in Seebeck coefficient S along with a concomitant suppression of\nelectrical resistivity \\r{ho} is observed in Se substituted single crystals. An\noverall enhancement of thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) by a factor of 310\nis observed in single crystals of Fe0.05In1.95(Te0.90Se0.10)5 compared to the\nparent In2Te5 single crystals.\n", "  In this article, we draw on previous reports from physics, science education,\nand women's studies to propose a more nuanced treatment of gender in physics\neducation research (PER). A growing body of PER examines gender differences in\nparticipation, performance, and attitudes toward physics. We have three\ncritiques of this work: (1) it does not question whether the achievements of\nmen are the most appropriate standard, (2) individual experiences and student\nidentities are undervalued, and (3) the binary model of gender is not\nquestioned. Driven by these critiques, we propose a conception of gender that\nis more up-to-date with other fields and discuss gender-as-performance as an\nextended example. We also discuss work on the intersection of identities [e.g.,\ngender with race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, lesbian, gay, bisexual,\nand transgender (LGBT) status], much of which has been conducted outside of\nphysics. Within PER, some studies examine the intersection of gender and race,\nand identify the lack of a single identity as a key challenge of \"belonging\" in\nphysics. Acknowledging this complexity enables us to further critique what we\nterm a binary gender deficit model. This framework, which is implicit in much\nof the gender-based PER, casts gender as a fixed binary trait and suggests that\nwomen are deficient in characteristics necessary to succeed. Alternative models\nof gender allow a greater range and fluidity of gender identities, and\nhighlight deficiencies in data that exclude women's experiences. We suggest new\ninvestigations that diverge from this expanded gender framework in PER.\n", "  In this paper, we consider a nonlinear interaction system between the\nbarotropic mode and the first baroclinic mode of the tropical atmosphere with\nmoisture; that was derived in [Frierson, D.M.W.; Majda, A.J.; Pauluis, O.M.:\nDynamics of precipitation fronts in the tropical atmosphere: a novel relaxation\nlimit, Commum. Math. Sci., 2 (2004), 591-626.] We establish the global\nexistence and uniqueness of strong solutions to this system, with initial data\nin $H^1$, for each fixed convective adjustment relaxation time parameter\n$\\varepsilon>0$. Moreover, if the initial data enjoy slightly more regularity\nthan $H^1$, then the unique strong solution depends continuously on the initial\ndata. Furthermore, by establishing several appropriate\n$\\varepsilon$-independent estimates, we prove that the system converges to a\nlimiting system, as the relaxation time parameter $\\varepsilon$ tends to zero,\nwith convergence rate of the order $O(\\sqrt\\varepsilon)$. Moreover, the\nlimiting system has a unique global strong solution, for any initial data in\n$H^1$, and such unique strong solution depends continuously on the initial data\nif the the initial data posses slightly more regularity than $H^1$. Notably,\nthis solves the VISCOUS VERSION of an open problem proposed in the above\nmentioned paper of Frierson, Majda and Pauluis.\n", "  One manifestation of quantum resonances is a large sojourn time, or\nautocorrelation, for states which are initially localized. We elaborate on\nLavine's time-energy uncertainty principle and give an estimate on the sojourn\ntime. For the case of perturbed embedded eigenstates the bound is explicit and\ninvolves Fermi's Golden Rule. It is valid for a very general class of systems.\nWe illustrate the theory by applications to resonances for time dependent\nsystems including the AC Stark effect as well as multistate systems.\n", "  We perform a detailed study of the weak interactions of standard model\nneutrinos with the primordial plasma and their effect on the resonant\nproduction of sterile neutrino dark matter. Motivated by issues in cosmological\nstructure formation on small scales, and reported X-ray signals that could be\ndue to sterile neutrino decay, we consider $7$ keV-scale sterile neutrinos.\nOscillation-driven production of such sterile neutrinos occurs at temperatures\n$T \\gtrsim 100$ MeV, where we study two significant effects of weakly charged\nspecies in the primordial plasma: (1) the redistribution of an input lepton\nasymmetry; (2) the opacity for active neutrinos. We calculate the\nredistribution analytically above and below the quark-hadron transition, and\nmatch with lattice QCD calculations through the transition. We estimate\nopacities due to tree level processes involving leptons and quarks above the\nquark-hadron transition, and the most important mesons below the transition. We\nreport final sterile neutrino dark matter phase space densities that are\nsignificantly influenced by these effects, and yet relatively robust to\nremaining uncertainties in the nature of the quark-hadron transition. We also\nprovide transfer functions for cosmological density fluctuations with cutoffs\nat $k \\simeq 10 \\ h \\ {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, that are relevant to galactic structure\nformation.\n", "  We have investigated the wave-function feature of Rydberg sodium in a uniform\nelectric field and found that the core-induced interaction of non-hydrogenic\natom in electric field can be directly visualized in the wave-function. As is\nwell known, the hydrogen atom in electric field can be separated in parabolic\ncoordinates (\\eta, \\xi), whose eigen-function can show a clear pattern towards\nnegative and positive directions corresponding to the so-called red and blue\nstates without ambiguity, respectively. It can be served as a complete\northogonal basis set to study the core-induced interaction of non-hydrogenic\natom in electric field. Owing to complete different patterns of the probability\ndistribution for red and blue states, the interaction can be visualized in the\nwave-function directly via superposition. Moreover, the constructive and\ndestructive interferences between red and blue states are also observed in the\nwave-function, explicitly explaining the experimental measurement for the\nspectral oscillator strength.\n", "  The geometric and electronic properties of Bi-adsorbed monolayer graphene,\nenriched by the strong effect of substrate, are investigated by\nfirst-principles calculations. The six-layered substrate, corrugated buffer\nlayer, and slightly deformed monolayer graphene are all simulated. Adatom\narrangements are thoroughly studied by analyzing the ground-state energies,\nbismuth adsorption energies, and Bi-Bi interaction energies of different adatom\nheights, inter-adatom distance, adsorption sites, and hexagonal positions. A\nhexagonal array of Bi atoms is dominated by the interactions between the buffer\nlayer and the monolayer graphene. An increase in temperature can overcome a\n$\\sim 50$ meV energy barrier and induce triangular and rectangular\nnanoclusters. The most stable and metastable structures agree with the scanning\ntunneling microscopy measurements. The density of states exhibits a finite\nvalue at the Fermi level, a dip at $\\sim -0.2$ eV, and a peak at $\\sim -0.6$\neV, as observed in the experimental measurements of the tunneling conductance.\n", "  Geological heterogeneities essentially affect the dynamics of a CO2 plume in\nsubsurface environments. Previously we showed how the dynamics of a CO2 plume\nis influenced by the multi-scale stratal architecture in deep saline\nreservoirs. The results strongly suggest that representing small-scale features\nis critical to understanding capillary trapping processes. Here we present the\nresult of simulation of CO2 trapping using two different conventional\napproaches, i.e. Brooks-Corey and van Genuchten, for the capillary pressure\ncurves. We showed that capillary trapping and dissolution rates are very\ndifferent for the Brooks-Corey and van Genuchten approaches when heterogeneity\nand hysteresis are both represented.\n", "  Starting from the Random Phase Approximation (RPA), we generalize the\nschematic model of separable interaction defning subspaces of ph excitations\nwith different coupling constants between them. This ansatz simplifies the RPA\neigenvalue problem to a finite, small dimensional system of equations which\nreduces the numerical effort. Associated dispersion relation and the\nnormalization condition are derived for the new defined unknowns of the system.\nIn contrast with the standard separable approach, the present formalism is able\nto describe more than one collective excitation even in the degenerate limit.\nThe theoretical framework is applied to neutral and singly charged spherical\nsodium clusters and C60 fullerene with results in good agreement with full RPA\ncalculations and experimental data.\n", "  We investigate the mobility of nanometer-size solutes in water in a uniform\nexternal electric field. General arguments are presented to show that a closed\nsurface cutting a volume from a polar liquid will carry an effective non-zero\nsurface charge density when preferential orientation of dipoles exists in the\ninterface. This effective charge will experience a non-vanishing drag in an\nexternal electric field even in the absence of free charge carriers. Numerical\nsimulations of model solutes are used to estimate the magnitude of the surface\ncharge density. We find it to be comparable to the values typically reported\nfrom the mobility measurements. Hydrated ions can potentially carry a\nsignificant excess of the effective charge due to over-polarization of the\ninterface. As a result, the electrokinetic charge can significantly deviate\nfrom the physical charge of free charge carriers. We propose to test the model\nby manipulating the polarizability of hydrated semiconductor nanoparticles with\nlight. The inversion of the mobility direction can be achieved by\nphotoexcitation, which increases the nanoparticle polarizability and leads to\nan inversion of the dipolar orientations of water molecules in the interface.\n", "  Bouncing droplets on a vibrating fluid bath can exhibit wave-particle\nbehavior, such as being propelled by interacting with its own wave field. These\ndroplets seem to walk across the bath, and thus are dubbed walkers. Experiments\nhave shown that walkers can exhibit exotic dynamical behavior indicative of\nchaos. While the integro-differential models developed for these systems agree\nwell with the experiments, they are difficult to analyze mathematically. In\nrecent years, simpler discrete dynamical models have been derived and studied\nnumerically. The numerical simulations of these models show evidence of exotic\ndynamics such as period doubling bifurcations, Neimark--Sacker (N--S)\nbifurcations, and even chaos. For example, in [Gilet, PRE 2014], based on\nsimulations Gilet conjectured the existence of a supercritical N-S bifurcation\nas the damping factor in his one-dimensional path model. We prove Gilet's\nconjecture and more; in fact, both supercritical and subcritical (N-S)\nbifurcations are produced by separately varying the damping factor and\nwave-particle coupling for all eigenmode shapes. Then we compare our\ntheoretical results with some previous and new numerical simulations, and find\ncomplete qualitative agreement. Furthermore, evidence of chaos is shown by\nnumerically studying a global bifurcation.\n", "  We consider a class of adaptive network models where links can only be\ncreated or deleted between nodes in different states. These models provide an\napproximate description of a set of systems where nodes represent agents moving\nin physical or abstract space, the state of each node represents the agent's\nheading direction, and links indicate mutual awareness. We show analytically\nthat the adaptive network description captures the phase transition to\ncollective motion in swarming systems and that the properties of this\ntransition are determined by the number of states (discrete heading directions)\nthat can be accessed by each agent.\n", "  We relate progress in statistical mechanics, both at and far from\nequilibrium, to advances in the theory of dynamical systems. We consider\ncomputer simulations of time-reversible deterministic chaos in small systems\nwith three- and four-dimensional phase spaces. These models provide us with a\nbasis for understanding equilibration and thermodynamic irreversibility in\nterms of Lyapunov instability, fractal distributions, and thermal constraints\n", "  We present results for several thermodynamic quantities within the\nnext-to-leading order calculation of the thermodynamic potential in\nperturbative QCD at finite temperature and chemical potential including\nnon-vanishing quark masses. These results are compared to lattice data and to\nhigher-order optimized perturbative calculations to investigate the trend\nbrought about by mass corrections.\n", "  Nonlinear diffusion $\\partial_t \\rho = \\Delta(\\Phi(\\rho))$ is considered for\na class of nonlinearities $\\Phi$. It is shown that for suitable choices of\n$\\Phi$, an associated Lyapunov functional can be interpreted as thermodynamics\nentropy. This information is used to derive an associated metric, here called\nthermodynamic metric. The analysis is confined to nonlinear diffusion\nobtainable as hydrodynamic limit of a zero range process. The thermodynamic\nsetting is linked to a large deviation principle for the underlying zero range\nprocess and the corresponding equation of fluctuating hydrodynamics. For the\nlatter connections, the thermodynamic metric plays a central role.\n", "  We study the small scale distribution of the $L^2$ mass of eigenfunctions of\nthe Laplacian on the flat torus $\\mathbb T^d$. Given an orthonormal basis of\neigenfunctions, we show the existence of a density one subsequence whose $L^2$\nmass equidistributes at small scales. In dimension two our result holds all the\nway down to the Planck scale. For dimensions $d=3,4$ we can restrict to\nindividual eigenspaces and show small scale equidistribution in that context.\n  We also study irregularities of quantum equidistribution: We construct\neigenfunctions whose $L^2$ mass does not equidistribute at all scales above the\nPlanck scale. Additionally, in dimension $d=4$ we show the existence of\neigenfunctions for which the proportion of $L^2$ mass in small balls blows up\nat certain scales.\n", "  One of the most relevant weather regimes in the mid-latitudes atmosphere is\nthe persistent deviation from the approximately zonally symmetric jet to the\nemergence of blocking patterns. Such configurations are usually connected to\nexceptional local stability properties of the flow which come along with an\nimproved local forecast skills during the phenomenon. It is instead extremely\nhard to predict onset and decay of blockings. Covariant Lyapunov Vectors (CLVs)\noffer a suitable characterization of the linear stability of a chaotic flow,\nsince they represent the full tangent linear dynamics by a covariant basis\nwhich explores linear perturbations at all time scales. Therefore, we assess\nwhether CLVs feature a signature of the blockings. As a first step, we examine\nthe CLVs for a quasi-geostrophic beta-plane 2-layer model in a periodic channel\nbaroclinically driven by a meridional temperature gradient $\\Delta T$. An\norographic forcing enhances the emergence of localized blocked regimes. We\ndetect the blocking events with a Tibaldi-Molteni scheme adapted to the\nperiodic channel. When blocking occurs, the global growth rates of the fastest\ngrowing CLVs are significantly higher. Hence, against intuition, the\ncirculation is globally more unstable in blocked phases. Such an increase in\nthe finite time Lyapunov exponents with respect to the long term average is\nattributed to stronger barotropic and baroclinic conversion in the case of high\ntemperature gradients, while for low values of \\Delta T, the effect is only due\nto stronger barotropic instability. In order to determine the localization of\nthe CLVs we compare the meridionally averaged variance of the CLVs during\nblocked and unblocked phases. We find that on average the variance of the CLVs\nis clustered around the center of blocking. These results show that the blocked\nflow affects all time scales and processes described by the CLVs.\n", "  We consider a coexistence of two axisymmetric liquid bridges LB_i and LB_m of\ntwo immiscible liquids i and m which are immersed in a third liquid (or gas) e\nand trapped between two smooth solid bodies with axisymmetric surfaces S_1,S_2\nand free contact lines. Evolution of liquid bridges allows two different\nconfigurations of LB_i and LB_m with multiple (five or three) interfaces of\nnon-smooth shape. We formulate a variational problem with volume constraints\nand present its governing equations supplemented by boundary conditions. We\nfind a universal relationship between curvature of the interfaces and discuss\nthe Young relation at the singular curve where all liquids meet together.\n", "  The Serre-Green-Naghdi system is a coupled, fully nonlinear system of\ndispersive evolution equations which approximates the full water wave problem.\nThe system is an extension of the well known shallow-water system to the\nsituation where the waves are long, but not so long that dispersive effects can\nbe neglected.\n  In the current work, the focus is on deriving mass, momentum and energy\ndensities and fluxes associated with the Serre-Green-Naghdi system. These\nquantities arise from imposing balance equations of the same asymptotic order\nas the evolution equations. In the case of an even bed, the conservation\nequations are satisfied exactly by the solutions of the Serre-Green-Naghdi\nsystem. The case of variable bathymetry is more complicated, with mass and\nmomentum conservation satisfied exactly, and energy conservation satisfied only\nin a global sense. In all cases, the quantities found here reduce correctly to\nthe corresponding counterparts in both the Boussinesq and the shallow-water\nscaling.\n  One consequence of the present analysis is that the energy loss appearing in\nthe shallow-water theory of undular bores is fully compensated by the emergence\nof oscillations behind the bore front. The situation is analyzed numerically by\napproximating solutions of the Serre-Green-Naghdi equations using a\nfinite-element discretization coupled with an adaptive Runge-Kutta time\nintegration scheme, and it is found that the energy is indeed conserved nearly\nto machine precision. As a second application, the shoaling of solitary waves\non a plane beach is analyzed. It appears that the Serre-Green-Naghdi equations\nare capable of predicting both the shape of the free surface and the evolution\nof kinetic and potential energy with good accuracy in the early stages of\nshoaling.\n", "  The B\\\"acklund transformation (BT) for the Camassa-Holm (CH) equation is\npresented and discussed. Unlike the vast majority of BTs studied in the past,\nfor CH the transformation acts on both the dependent and (one of) the\nindependent variables. Superposition principles are given for the action of\ndouble BTs on the variables of the CH and the potential CH equations.\nApplications of the BT and its superposition principles are presented,\nspecifically the construction of travelling wave solutions, a new method to\nconstruct multi-soliton, multi-cuspon and soliton-cuspon solutions, and a\nderivation of generating functions for the local symmetries and conservation\nlaws of the CH hierarchy.\n", "  The single electron magnetotransport in a vertical bi-layer semiconductor\nnanowire made of InAlAs/InGaAs and AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure is theoretically\nstudied. The magnetic field is directed perpendicularily to the main\n(transport) axis of the quantum wire and both non-zero components of magnetic\nfield, that is the transverse and the vertical ones, allow to change the\nmagnitude of intra-layer and inter-layer subbands mixing, respectively. We\nanalyze in detail the changes introduced to energy dispersion relation E(k) by\nstrong titled magnetic field up to several teslas for a symmetric and an\nasymmetric confining potential in the growth direction. These calculated energy\ndispersion relations are thereafter used to show that the value of conductance\nof bi-layer nanowire may jump as well as drop by few conductance quanta when\nthe Fermi energy is changed what in conjunction with spin Zeeman effect may\ngive a moderately spin polarized current.\n", "  Using high-resolution particle image velocimetry we measure velocity\nprofiles, the wind Reynolds number and characteristics of turbulent plumes in\nTaylor-Couette flow for a radius ratio of 0.5 and Taylor number of up to\n$6.2\\cdot10^9$. The extracted angular velocity profiles follow a log-law more\nclosely than the azimuthal velocity profiles due to the strong curvature of\nthis $\\eta=0.5$ setup. The scaling of the wind Reynolds number with the Taylor\nnumber agrees with the theoretically predicted 3/7-scaling for the classical\nturbulent regime, which is much more pronounced than for the well-explored\n$\\eta=0.71$ case, for which the ultimate regime sets in at much lower Ta. By\nmeasuring at varying axial positions, roll structures are found for\ncounter-rotation while no clear coherent structures are seen for pure inner\ncylinder rotation. In addition, turbulent plumes coming from the inner and\nouter cylinder are investigated. For pure inner cylinder rotation, the plumes\nin the radial velocity move away from the inner cylinder, while the plumes in\nthe azimuthal velocity mainly move away from the outer cylinder. For\ncounter-rotation, the mean radial flow in the roll structures strongly affects\nthe direction and intensity of the turbulent plumes. Furthermore, it is\nexperimentally confirmed that in regions where plumes are emitted, boundary\nlayer profiles with a logarithmic signature are created.\n", "  The nine-component positive vector optical tomographic probability portrait\nof quantum state of spin-1 particles containing full spatial and spin\ninformation about the state without redundancy is constructed. Also the\nsuggested approach is expanded to symplectic tomography representation and to\nrepresentations with quasidistributions. The evolution equations for\nconstructed vector optical and symplectic tomograms and vector\nquasidistributions for arbitrary Hamiltonian are found. The evolution equations\nare also obtained in special case of the quantum system of charged spin-1\nparticle in arbitrary electro-magnetic field, which are analogs of\nnon-relativistic Proca equation in appropriate representations. The\ngeneralization of proposed approach to the cases of arbitrary spin is\ndiscussed. The possibility of formulation of quantum mechanics of the systems\nwith spins in terms of joint probability distributions without the use of wave\nfunctions or density matrixes is explicitly demonstrated.\n", "  We have studied the dynamics and symmetries of a particle constrained to move\nin a torus knot. The Hamiltonian system turns out to be Second Class in Dirac's\nformulation and the Dirac brackets yield novel noncommutative structures. The\nequations of motion are obtained for a path in general where the knot is\npresent in the particle orbit but it is not restricted to a particular torus.\nWe also study the motion when it is restricted to a specific torus. The\nrotational symmetries are studied as well. We have also considered the behavior\nof small fluctuations of the particle motion about a fixed torus knot.\n", "  A new value for the emission probability of 137.144keV g-ray of 186gRe decay\nare re-recommended to be 9.47+-0.03 (%). From this new g-ray emission\nprobability, the measured cross sections for 187Re(n,2n)186mRe and\n187Re(n,2n)186gRe reactions around 14MeV are evaluated, and the total cross\nsection for 187Re(n,2n)186m+gRe reaction at 14.8MeV is recommended to be\n2213+-116 mb. The UNF code are adopted to calculate the total cross sections\nfor 187Re(n,2n)186m+gRe reaction below 20 MeV fitting to the recommended value\n2213+-116 mb at 14.8MeV using a set of optimum neutron optical potential\nparameters which obtained on the relevant experimental data of Re. Then the\nisomeric cross section ratios for 187Re(n,2n)186m,gRe reaction are calculated\nusing the method of Monte Carlo calculations based on the nuclear statistical\ntheory. Combining these two calculated results, the excitation functions for\n187Re(n,2n)186mRe and 187Re(n,2n)186gRe reactions are obtained. The obtained\nresults are in good agreement with the available experimental data, which\nindicates that present method is useful to deduce the isomeric cross sections\nfor (n,2n) reaction.\n", "  Long-term creep (i.e., deformation under sustained load) is a significant\nmaterial response that needs to be accounted for in concrete structural design.\nHowever, the nature and origin of creep remains poorly understood, and\ncontroversial. Here, we propose that concrete creep at RH (relative humidity) >\n50%, but fixed moisture-contents (i.e., basic creep), arises from a\ndissolution-precipitation mechanism, active at nanoscale grain contacts, as is\noften observed in a geological context, e.g., when rocks are exposed to\nsustained loads, in moist environments. Based on micro-indentation and vertical\nscanning interferometry experiments, and molecular dynamics simulations carried\nout on calcium-silicate-hydrates (C-S-H's), the major binding phase in\nconcrete, of different compositions, we show that creep rates are well\ncorrelated to dissolution rates - an observation which supports the\ndissolution-precipitation mechanism as the origin of concrete creep. C-S-H\ncompositions featuring high resistance to dissolution, and hence creep are\nidentified - analysis of which, using topological constraint theory, indicates\nthat these compositions present limited relaxation modes on account of their\noptimally connected (i.e., constrained) atomic networks.\n", "  We consider the Hamiltonian $\\hat {\\mathrm{H}}_{\\mu}$ of a system of three\nidentical particles(bosons) on the $d-$ dimensional lattice $\\Z^d, d=1,2$\ninteracting via pairwise zero-range attractive potential $\\mu<0$. We describe\nprecise location and structure of the essential spectrum of the Schr\\\"odinger\noperator $H_\\mu(K),K\\in \\T^d$ associated to $\\hat {\\mathrm{H}}_\\mu$ and prove\nthe finiteness of the number of bound states of $H_\\mu(K),K\\in \\T^d$ lying\nbelow the bottom of the essential spectrum. Moreover, we show that bound states\ndecay exponentially at infinity and eigenvalues and corresponding bound states\nof $H_\\mu(K),K\\in \\T^d$ are regular as a function of center of mass\nquasi-momentum $K\\in \\T^d$.\n", "  A dual-channel AlN/GaN high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) architecture\nis demonstrated that leverages ultra-thin epitaxial layers to suppress\nsurface-state related gate lag. Two high-density two-dimensional electron gas\n(2DEG) channels are utilized in an AlN/GaN/AlN/GaN heterostructure wherein the\ntop 2DEG serves as a quasi-equipotential that screens potential fluctuations\nresulting from surface and interface trapped charge. The bottom channel serves\nas the transistor's modulated channel. Dual-channel AlN/GaN heterostructures\nwere grown by molecular beam epitaxy on free-standing HVPE GaN substrates where\n300 nm long recessed and non-recessed gate HEMTs were fabricated. The\nrecessed-gate HEMT demonstrated a gate lag ratio (GLR) of 0.88 with no collapse\nin drain current and supporting small signal metrics $f_t/f_{max}$ of 27/46\nGHz. These performance results are contrasted with the non-recessed gate\ndual-channel HEMT with a GLR of 0.74 and 82 mA/mm current collapse with\n$f_t/f_{max}$ of 48/60 GHz.\n", "  Through averaging the Einstein equations over transverse gravitational\nperturbations it is obtained a closed system of two ordinary differential\nequations describing macroscopic cosmological evolution of the isotropic\nspace-flat Universe filled with gravitational radiation. It is found an\nasymptotic solution of evolution equation for gravitational perturbation\namplitude. Making the substitution of this solution into Einstein equation\naveraged over gravitational perturbations, the single evolution non-linear\nordinary differential second-order equation relative to macroscopic scale\nfactor is obtained. It is also found a solution of evolution equation for scale\nfactor in WKB-approximation which analytically describes the process of\ntransformation from ultrarelativistic regime of cosmological extension to\ninflationary one.\n", "  The power spectrum of primordial tensor perturbations $\\mathcal{P}_t$\nincreases rapidly in high frequency region if the spectral index $n_t>0$. It is\nshown that the amplitude of relic gravitational wave $h_t$($5\\times10^9$Hz)\nvaries from $10^{-36}$ to $10^{-25}$ while $n_t$ varies from $-6.25\\times\n10^{-3}$ to $0.87$. High frequency gravitational waves detector that is\nproposed by F.-Y. Li detects gravitational waves through observing the\nperturbed photon flux that is generated by interaction between the relic\ngravitational waves and electromagnetic system. It is shown that the\nperturbative photon flux $N_x^1$($5\\times10^9$Hz) varies from\n$1.40\\times10^{-4}\\rm s^{-1}$ to $2.85\\times10^{7}\\rm s^{-1}$ while $n_t$\nvaries from $-6.25\\times 10^{-3}$ to $0.87$. Correspondingly, the ratio of the\ntransverse perturbative photon flux $N_x^1$ to the background photon flux\nvaries from $10^{-28}$ to $10^{-16}$.\n", "  Original Whitham's method of derivation of modulation equations is applied to\nsystems whose dynamics is described by a perturbed Korteweg-de Vries equation.\nTwo situations are distinguished: (i) the perturbation leads to appearance of\nright-hand sides in the modulation equations so that they become non-uniform;\n(ii) the perturbation leads to modification of the matrix of Whitham\nvelocities. General form of Whitham modulation equations is obtained for each\ncase. The essential difference between them is illustrated by an example of\nso-called `generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation'. Method of finding\nsteady-state solutions of perturbed Whitham equations in the case of\ndissipative perturbations is considered.\n", "  Weak measurement is a novel technique for parameter estimation with higher\nprecision. In this paper we develop a general theory for the parameter\nestimation based on weak measurement technique with arbitrary postselection.\nThe previous weak value amplification model and the joint weak measurement\nmodel are two special cases in our theory. Applying the developed theory, the\ntime-delay estimation is investigated in both theory and experiment.\nExperimental results shows that when the time-delay is ultra small, the joint\nweak measurement scheme outperforms the weak value amplification scheme, and is\nrobust against not only the misalignment errors but also the\nwavelength-dependence of the optical components. These results are consistent\nwith the theoretical predictions that has not been verified by any experiment\nbefore.\n", "  We calculate the one-point probability density distribution functions (PDF)\nand the power spectra of the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ and\nkSZ) effects and the mean Compton Y parameter using the Magneticum Pathfinder\nsimulations, state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of a\nlarge cosmological volume of (896 Mpc/h)^3. These simulations follow in detail\nthe thermal and chemical evolution of the intracluster medium as well as the\nevolution of super-massive black holes and their associated feedback processes.\nWe construct full-sky maps of tSZ and kSZ from the light-cones out to z=0.17,\nand one realization of 8.8x8.8 degree wide, deep light-cone out to z=5.2. The\nlocal universe at z<0.027 is simulated by a constrained realisation. The tail\nof the one-point PDF of tSZ from the deep light-cone follows a power-law shape\nwith an index of -3.2. Once convolved with the effective beam of Planck, it\nagrees with the PDF measured by Planck. The predicted tSZ power spectrum agrees\nwith that of the Planck data at all multipoles up to l~1000, once the\ncalculations are scaled to the Planck 2015 cosmological parameters with\n\\Omega_m=0.308 and \\sigma_8=0.8149. Consistent with the results in the\nliterature, however, we continue to find the tSZ power spectrum at l=3000 that\nis significantly larger than that estimated from the high-resolution\nground-based data. The simulation predicts the mean fluctuating Compton Y value\nof <Y>=1.18x10^{-6} for \\Omega_m=0.272 and \\sigma_8=0.809. Nearly half (~\n5x10^{-7}) of the signal comes from halos below a virial mass of\n10^{13}M_\\odot/h. Scaling this to the Planck 2015 parameters, we find\n<Y>=1.57x10^{-6}. The PDF and the power spectrum of kSZ from our simulation\nagree broadly with the previous work.\n", "  Newton-Cartan geometry has played a central role in recent discussions of\nnon-relativistic holography and condensed matter systems. Although the\nconformal transformation in non-relativistic holography can be easily rephrased\nin Newton-Cartan geometry, we show that it requires a nontrivial procedure to\nget the consistent form of anisotropic disformal transformation in this\ngeometry. Furthermore, as an application of the newly obtained disformal\ntransformation, we use it to induce a new geometry.\n", "  In this work, a new neutron and {\\gamma}(n/{\\gamma}) discrimination method\nbased on an Elman Neural Network (ENN) is proposed to improve the\ndiscrimination performance of liquid scintillator (LS) detectors. Neutron and\n{\\gamma} data were acquired from an EJ-335 LS detector, which was exposed in a\n241Am-9Be radiation field. Neutron and {\\gamma} events were discriminated using\ntwo methods of artificial neural network including the ENN and a typical Back\nPropagation Neural Network (BPNN) as a control. The results show that the two\nmethods have different n/{\\gamma} discrimination performances. Compared to the\nBPNN, the ENN provides an improved of Figure of Merit (FOM) in n/{\\gamma}\ndiscrimination. The FOM increases from 0.907 {\\pm} 0.034 to 0.953 {\\pm} 0.037\nby using the new method of the ENN. The proposed n/{\\gamma} discrimination\nmethod based on ENN provides a new choice of pulse shape discrimination in\nneutron detection.\n", "  Advances in the amplification and manipulation of ultrashort laser pulses has\nled to revolutions in several areas. Examples include chirped pulse\namplification for generating high peak-power lasers, power-scalable\namplification techniques, pulse shaping via modulation of spatially-dispersed\nlaser pulses, and efficient frequency-mixing in quasi-phase-matched nonlinear\ncrystals to access new spectral regions. In this work, we introduce and\ndemonstrate a new platform for nonlinear optics which has the potential to\ncombine all of these separate functionalities (pulse amplification, frequency\ntransfer, and pulse shaping) into a single monolithic device. Moreover, our\napproach simultaneously offers solutions to the performance-limiting issues in\nthe conventionally-used techniques, and supports scaling in power and bandwidth\nof the laser source. The approach is based on two-dimensional patterning of\nquasi-phase-matching gratings combined with optical parametric interactions\ninvolving spatially dispersed laser pulses. Our proof of principle experiment\ndemonstrates this new paradigm via mid-infrared optical parametric chirped\npulse amplification of few-cycle pulses.\n", "  We examine the general question of statistical changes experienced by\nensembles of nonlinear random waves propagating in systems ruled by integrable\nequations. In our study that enters within the framework of integrable\nturbulence, we specifically focus on optical fiber systems accurately described\nby the integrable one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation. We consider\nrandom complex fields having a gaussian statistics and an infinite extension at\ninitial stage. We use numerical simulations with periodic boundary conditions\nand optical fiber experiments to investigate spectral and statistical changes\nexperienced by nonlinear waves in focusing and in defocusing propagation\nregimes. As a result of nonlinear propagation, the power spectrum of the random\nwave broadens and takes exponential wings both in focusing and in defocusing\nregimes. Heavy-tailed deviations from gaussian statistics are observed in\nfocusing regime while low-tailed deviations from gaussian statistics are\nobserved in defocusing regime. After some transient evolution, the wave system\nis found to exhibit a statistically stationary state in which neither the\nprobability density function of the wave field nor the spectrum change with the\nevolution variable. Separating fluctuations of small scale from fluctuations of\nlarge scale both in focusing and defocusing regime, we reveal the phenomenon of\nintermittency; i.e., small scales are characterized by large heavy-tailed\ndeviations from Gaussian statistics, while the large ones are almost Gaussian.\n", "  We construct relative and global Euler sequences of a module. We apply it to\nprove some acyclicity results of the Koszul complex of a module and to compute\nthe cohomology of the sheaves of (relative and absolute) differential $p$-forms\nof a projective bundle. In particular we generalize Bott's formula for the\nprojective space to a projective bundle over a scheme of characteristic zero.\n", "  We investigate a semiconductor quantum dot as a microscopic analog of a basic\noptomechanical setup. We show, that optomechanical features can be reproduced\nby the solid-state platform, arising from parallels of the underlying\ninteraction processes, which in the optomechanical case is the radiation\npressure coupling and in the semiconductor case the electron-phonon coupling.\nIn optomechanics, phonons are typically induced via confined photons, acting on\na movable mirror, while in the semiconductor system the phonons are emitted by\nthe laser-driven electronic system. There are analogous effects present for\nboth systems, featuring bistabilities, optically induced phonon lasing and\nenhanced phonon loss. Nonetheless, the different statistical nature of the\noptical cavity and the electronic system also leads to qualitative differences.\n", "  Accelerated Stokesian Dynamics (ASD) simulation and a microstructural theory\nare applied to study structure and the viscosity of hard-sphere Brownian\nsuspensions in active microrheology (MR).We consider moderate to dense\nsuspensions, from near to far from equilibrium conditions.The theory explicitly\nconsiders many-body hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) in active MR, and is\ncompared with ASD.Two conditions of moving the probe with constant force (CF)\nand constant velocity (CV) are considered.The structure is quantified using the\nprobability distribution of colloidal particles around the probe, g(r), which\nis computed as a solution to the pair Smoluchowski equation (SE) for\n0.2<\\phi<0.50, and a range of Peclet numbers (Pe), describing the ratio of\nexternal force on the probe to thermal forces.Results of ASD and theory\ndemonstrate that a wake zone depleted of bath particles behind the moving probe\nforms at large Pe, while a boundary-layer accumulation develops upstream.The\nwake length saturates at Pe>>1 for CF while it continuously grows in CV.This\ncontrast in behavior is related to the dispersion in the motion of the probe\nunder CF conditions, while CV motion has no dispersion.This effect is\nincorporated in the theory as a force-induced hydrodynamic diffusion flux in\nthe pair SE. We also demonstrate that, despite this difference of structure in\nCF and CV, g(r) near the probe is set by Pe, for both CF and CV resulting in\nsimilar values for their viscosity.Using the theory, the structural anisotropy\nand Brownian viscosity near equilibrium are shown to be quantitatively similar\nin both CF and CV motions, which is in contrast with the dilute theory which\npredict distortions and Brownian viscosities twice as large in CV, relative to\nCF.This difference arises due to the many-body interactions associated with the\nequilibrium structure in the moderate to dense regime.\n", "  In this paper we consider a class of (2+1)D schematic models with\nfour-fermion interactions that are effectively used in studying\ncondensed-matter systems with planar crystal structure, and especially\ngraphene. Symmetry breaking in these models occurs due to a possible appearance\nof condensates. Special attention is paid to the symmetry properties of the\nappearing condensates in the framework of discrete chiral and $\\mathcal C$,\n$\\mathcal P$ and $\\mathcal T$ transformations. Moreover, boundary conditions\ncorresponding to carbon nanotubes are considered and their relations with the\neffect of an applied external magnetic field are studied. To this end we\ncalculated the effective potential for the nanotube model including effects of\nfinite temperature, density and an external magnetic field. As an illustration\nwe made numerical calculations of the chiral symmetry properties in a simpler\nGross--Neveu model with only one condensate taken into account. We also\ninvestigated the phase structure of the nanotube model under the influence of\nthe Aharonov--Bohm effect and demonstrated that there is a nontrivial relation\nbetween the magnitude of the Aharonov--Bohm phase, compactification of the\nspatial dimension and thermal restoration of the originally broken chiral\nsymmetry.\n", "  In this work, an analytic model is proposed which provides in a continuous\nmanner the current-voltage characteristic (I-V) of high performance tunneling\nfield-effect transistors (TFETs) based on direct bandgap semiconductors. The\nmodel provides closed-form expressions for I-V based on: 1) a modified version\nof the well-known Fowler-Nordheim (FN) formula (in the ON-state), and 2) an\nequation which describes the OFF-state performance while providing continuity\nat the ON/OFF threshold by means of a term introduced as the \"continuity\nfactor\". It is shown that traditional approaches such as FN are accurate in\nTFETs only through correct evaluation of the total band bending distance and\nthe \"tunneling effective mass\". General expressions for these two key\nparameters are provided. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the tunneling\neffective mass captures both the ellipticity of evanescent states and the dual\n(electron/hole) behavior of the tunneling carriers, and it is further shown\nthat such a concept is even applicable to semiconductors with nontrivial energy\ndispersion. Ultimately, it is found that the I-V characteristics obtained by\nusing this model are in close agreement with state-of-the-art quantum transport\nsimulations both in the ON- and OFF-state, thus providing validation of the\nanalytic approach.\n", "  We present a formula for an infinite number of universal quantum logic gates,\nwhich are $4$ by $4$ unitary solutions to the Yang-Baxter (Y-B) equation. We\nobtain this family from a certain representation of the cyclic group of order\n$n$. We then show that this {\\it discrete} family, parametrized by integers\n$n$, is in fact, a small sub-class of a larger {\\it continuous} family,\nparametrized by real numbers $\\theta$, of universal quantum gates. We discuss\nthe corresponding Yang-Baxterization and related symmetries in the concomitant\nHamiltonian.\n", "  The proton charge radius inferred from muonic hydrogen spectroscopy is not\ncompatible with the previous value given by CODATA-2010, which, on its turn,\nessentially relies on measurements of the electron-proton interaction. The\nproton's new size was extracted from the 2S-2P Lamb shift in the muonic\nhydrogen, which showed an energy excess of 0.3 meV in comparison to the\ntheoretical prediction, evaluated with the CODATA radius. Higher-dimensional\ngravity is a candidate to explain this discrepancy, since the muon-proton\ngravitational interaction is stronger than the electron-proton interaction and,\nin the context of braneworld models, the gravitational potential can be hugely\namplified in short distances when compared to the Newtonian potential.\nMotivated by these ideas, we study a muonic hydrogen confined in a thick brane.\nWe show that the muon-proton gravitational interaction modified by extra\ndimensions can provide the additional separation of 0.3 meV between 2S and 2P\nstates. In this scenario, the gravitational energy depends on the\nhigher-dimensional Planck mass and indirectly on the brane thickness. Studying\nthe behavior of the gravitational energy with respect to the brane thickness in\na realistic range, we find constraints for the fundamental Planck mass that\nsolve the proton radius puzzle and are consistent with previous experimental\nbounds.\n", "  We consider the linear stability of Hill's vortex with respect to\naxisymmetric perturbations. Given that Hill's vortex is a solution of a\nfree-boundary problem, this stability analysis is performed by applying methods\nof shape differentiation to the contour dynamics formulation of the problem in\na 3D axisymmetric geometry. This approach allows us to systematically account\nfor the effect of boundary deformations on the linearized evolution of the\nvortex under the constraint of constant circulation. The resulting singular\nintegro-differential operator defined on the vortex boundary is discretized\nwith a highly accurate spectral approach. This operator has two unstable and\ntwo stable eigenvalues complemented by a continuous spectrum of\nneutrally-stable eigenvalues. By considering a family of suitably regularized\n(smoothed) eigenvalue problems solved with a range of numerical resolutions we\ndemonstrate that the corresponding eigenfunctions are in fact singular objects\nin the form of infinitely sharp peaks localized at the front and rear\nstagnation points. These findings thus refine the results of the classical\nanalysis by Moffatt & Moore (1978).\n", "  Artificial metasurfaces are capable of completely manipulating the phase,\namplitude, and polarization of light with high spatial resolutions. The\nemerging design based on high-index and low-loss dielectrics has led to the\nrealization of novel metasurfaces with high transmissions, but these devices\nusually operate at the limited bandwidth, and are sensitive to the incident\npolarization. Here, for the first time we report experimentally the\npolarization-independent and high-efficiency dielectric metasurfaces spanning\nthe visible wavelengths about 200 nm, which are of importance for novel flat\noptical devices operating over a broad spectrum. The diffraction efficiencies\nof the gradient metasurfaces consisting of the multi-fold symmetric\nnano-crystalline silicon nanopillars are up to 93% at 670 nm, and exceed 75% at\nthe wavelengths from 600 to 800 nm for the two orthogonally polarized\nincidences. These dielectric metasurfaces hold great potential to replace\nprisms, lenses and other conventional optical elements.\n", "  The entanglement of an optically generated electron-hole pair in artificial\nquantum dot molecules is calculated considering the effects of decoherence by\ninteraction with environment. Since the system evolves into a mixed states and\ndue to the complexity of energy level structure, we use the negativity as\nentanglement quantifier, which is well defined in $d \\otimes d^\\prime$\ncomposite vector spaces. By a numerical analysis of the non-unitary dynamics of\nthe exciton states, we establish the feasibility of producing protected\nentangled superpositions by an appropriate tuning of bias electric field, $F$.\nA stationary state with a high value of negativity (high degree of\nentanglement) is obtained by fine tuning of $F$ close to a resonant condition\nbetween indirect excitons. We also found that when the optical excitation is\nset approximately equal to the electron tunneling coupling, $\\Omega/T_e \\sim\n1$, the entanglement reaches a maximum value. In front of the experimental\nfeasibility of the specific condition mentioned before, our proposal becomes an\nuseful strategy to find robust entangled states in condensed matter systems.\n", "  The future Electron - Ion ($eA$) Collider is expected to probe the high\nenergy regime of the QCD dynamics, with the exclusive vector meson production\ncross section being one of the most promising observables. In this paper we\ncomplement previous studies of exclusive processes presenting a comprehensive\nanalysis of diffractive $\\rho$ production at small $x$. We compute the coherent\nand incoherent cross sections taking into account non-linear QCD dynamical\neffects and considering different models for the dipole - proton scattering\namplitude and for the vector meson wave function. The dependence of these cross\nsections with the energy, photon virtuality, nuclear mass number and squared\nmomentum transfer is analysed in detail. Moreover, we compare the non-linear\npredictions with those obtained in the linear regime. Finally, we also estimate\nthe exclusive photon, $J/\\Psi$ and $\\phi$ production and compare with the\nresults obtained for $\\rho$ production. Our results demonstrate that the\nanalysis of diffractive $\\rho$ production in future electron - ion colliders\nwill be important to understand the non-linear QCD dynamics.\n", "  A GEM tracking detector with an extended drift region has been studied as\npart of an effort to develop new tracking detectors for future experiments at\nRHIC and for the Electron Ion Collider that is being planned for BNL or JLAB.\nThe detector consists of a triple GEM stack with a small drift region that was\noperated in a mini TPC type configuration. Both the position and arrival time\nof the charge deposited in the drift region were measured on the readout plane\nwhich allowed the reconstruction of a short vector for the track traversing the\nchamber. The resulting position and angle information from the vector could\nthen be used to improve the position resolution of the detector for larger\nangle tracks, which deteriorates rapidly with increasing angle for conventional\nGEM tracking detectors using only charge centroid information. Two types of\nreadout planes were studied. One was a COMPASS style readout plane with 400\nmicron pitch XY strips and the other consisted of 2x10mm2 chevron pads. The\ndetector was studied in test beams at Fermilab and CERN, along with additional\nmeasurements in the lab, in order to determine its position and angular\nresolution for incident track angles up to 45 degrees. Several algorithms were\nstudied for reconstructing the vector using the position and timing information\nin order to optimize the position and angular resolution of the detector for\nthe different readout planes. Applications for large angle tracking detectors\nat RHIC and EIC are also discussed.\n", "  The fully symmetric Gaussian tripartite entangled pure states will not\nexhibit two-mode Einstein Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)-steering. This means that any\ntwo participants cannot share quantum secrets using the security of one-sided\ndevice independent quantum key distribution (1SDI-QKD) without involving the\nthird. They are restricted at most to standard quantum key distribution\n(S-QKD), which is less secure. Here we show that least some asymmetric\ntripartite systems can exhibit bipartite EPR-steering, so that two of the\nparticipants can use 1SDI-QKD without involving the other. This is possible\nbecause the promiscuity relations of continuous-variable tripartite\nentanglement are different from those of discrete-variable systems. We analyse\nthese properties for two different systems, showing that the asymmetric system\nhas an extra degree of flexibility not found in the symmetric one.\n", "  Fluctuation theorem is one of the major achievements in the field of\nnonequilibrium statistical mechanics during the past two decades. Steady-state\nfluctuation theorem of sample entropy production rate in terms of large\ndeviation principle for diffusion processes have not been rigorously proved yet\ndue to technical difficulties. Here we give a proof for the steady-state\nfluctuation theorem of a diffusion process in magnetic fields, with explicit\nexpressions of the free energy function and rate function. The proof is based\non the Karhunen-Lo\\'{e}ve expansion of complex-valued Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess.\n", "  We study two dimensional conformal field theories in the semiclassical limit.\nIn this limit, the four-point function is dominated by intermediate primaries\nof particular weights along with their descendants, and the crossing equations\nsimplify drastically. For a four-point function receiving sufficiently small\ncontributions from the light primaries, the structure constants involving heavy\nprimaries follow a universal formula. Applying our results to the four-point\nfunction of the $\\mathbb Z_2$ twist field in the symmetric product orbifold, we\nproduce the Hellerman bound and the logarithmically corrected Cardy formula\nthat is valid for $h \\geq c/12$.\n", "  We analyze theoretically the quantization of conductance occurring with cold\nbosonic atoms trapped in two reservoirs connected by a constriction with an\nattractive gate potential. We focus on temperatures slightly above the\ncondensation threshold in the reservoirs. We show that a conductance step\noccurs, coinciding with the appearance of a condensate in the constriction.\nConductance relies on a collective process involving the quantum condensation\nof an atom into an elementary excitation and the subsequent quantum evaporation\nof an atom, in contrast with ballistic fermion transport. The value of the\nbosonic conductance plateau is strongly enhanced compared to fermions and\nexplicitly depends on temperature. We highlight the role of weak repulsive\ninteractions between the bosons in preventing them from collapsing into the\nconstriction.\n", "  It is nearly 150 years since Maxwell challenged the validity of the second\nlaw of thermodynamics by imagining a tiny creature who could sort the molecules\nof a gas in such a way that would decrease entropy without exerting any work.\nThe demon has been discussed largely using thought experiments, but it has\nrecently become possible to exert control over nanoscale systems, just as\nMaxwell imagined, and the status of the second law has become a more practical\nmatter, raising the issue of how measurements manage our ignorance in a way\nthat can be exploited. The framework of stochastic thermodynamics extends\nmacroscopic concepts such as heat, work, entropy and irreversibility to small\nsystems and allows us explore the matter. Some arguments against a successful\ndemon imply a second law that can be suspended indefinitely until we dissipate\nenergy in order to remove the records of his operations. In contrast, under\nstochastic thermodynamics the demon fails because on average more work is\nperformed upfront in making a measurement than is to be extracted by exploiting\nthe outcome. This requires us to exclude systems and a demon that evolve under\nwhat might be termed self-sorting dynamics, and we reflect on the constraints\non control that this implies while still working within a thermodynamic\nframework.\n", "  We prove operator-norm resolvent convergence estimates for one-dimensional\nperiodic differential operators with rapidly oscillating coefficients in the\nnon-uniformly elliptic high-contrast setting, which has been out of reach of\nthe existing homogenisation techniques. Our asymptotic analysis is based on a\nspecial representation of the resolvent of the operator in terms of the\n$M$-matrix of an associated boundary triple (\"Krein resolvent formula''). The\nresulting asymptotic behaviour is shown to be described, up to a unitary\nequivalent transformation, by a non-standard version of the Kronig-Penney model\non $\\mathbb R$.\n", "  We review various methods for the analysis of initial-value problems for\nintegrable dispersive equations in the weak-dispersion or semiclassical regime.\nSome methods are sufficiently powerful to rigorously explain the generation of\nmodulated wavetrains, so-called dispersive shock waves, as the result of shock\nformation in a limiting dispersionless system. They also provide a detailed\ndescription of the solution near caustic curves that delimit dispersive shock\nwaves, revealing fascinating universal wave patterns.\n", "  We describe an automatic event recognition (AER) system based on a\nthree-dimensional spatio-temporal correlator (STC) that combines the techniques\nof holographic correlation and photon echo based temporal pattern recognition.\nThe STC is shift invariant in space and time. It can be used to recognize\nrapidly an event (e.g., a short video clip) that may be present in a large\nvideo file, and determine the temporal location of the event. Using polar\nMellin transform, it is possible to realize an STC that is also scale and\nrotation invariant spatially. Numerical simulation results of such a system are\npresented using quantum mechanical equations of evolution. For this simulation\nwe have used the model of an idealized, decay-free two level system of atoms\nwith an inhomogeneous broadening that is larger than the inverse of the\ntemporal resolution of the data stream. We show how such a system can be\nrealized by using a lambda-type three level system in atomic vapor, via\nadiabatic elimination of the intermediate state. We have also developed\nanalytically a three dimensional transfer function of the system, and shown\nthat it agrees closely with the results obtained via explicit simulation of the\natomic response. The analytical transfer function can be used to determine the\nresponse of an STC very rapidly. In addition to the correlation signal, other\nnonlinear terms appear in the explicit numerical model. These terms are also\nverified by the analytical model. We describe how the AER can be operated in a\nmanner such that the correlation signal remains unaffected by the additional\nnonlinear terms. We also show how such a practical STC can be realized using a\ncombination of a porous-glass based Rb vapor cell, a holographic video disc,\nand a lithium niobate crystal.\n", "  Various microfluidic systems, such as chemical and biological lab-on-a-chip\ndevices, involve motion of multiple droplets within an immersing fluid in\nshallow micro-channels. Modeling the dynamics of such systems requires\ncalculation of the forces of interaction between the moving droplets. These\nforces are commonly approximated by superposition of dipoles solutions, which\nrequires an assumption of sufficiently large distance between the droplets. In\nthis work we obtain exact solutions (in the Hele-Shaw limit) for two moving\ndroplets, and a droplet within a droplet, located within a moving immersing\nfluid, without limitation on the distance between the droplets. This is\nachieved by solution of the pressure field in a bi-polar coordinate system and\ncalculation of the force in a Cartesian coordinate system. Our results are\ncompared with numerical computations, experimental data and the existing\ndipole-based models. We utilize the results to calculate the dynamics of a\ndroplet within a droplet, and of two close droplets, located within an\nimmersing fluid with oscillating speed. The obtained results may be used to\nstudy the dynamics of dense droplet lattices, common to many microfluidic\nsystems.\n", "  In the last decade or so there has been debate over the possibility that the\nfuzzy quantum nature of spacetime might decohere wavefronts emanating from very\ndistant sources. Consequences of that could be \"blurred\" or \"faded\" images of\ncompact structures in galaxies, primarily at z>1 for their emitted X-rays and\ngamma-rays, but perhaps even in ultraviolet through optical light at higher\nredshift. So far there are only inconclusive hints of this from z~4\nactive-galactic nucleii and gamma-ray bursts viewed with Fermi and Hubble Space\nTelescope. If correct though, that would impose a significant, fundamental\nresolution limit for galaxies out to z~8 in the era of the James Webb Space\nTelescope and the next generation of ground-based telescopes using adaptive\noptics.\n", "  We consider the monomer-dimer partition function on arbitrary finite planar\ngraphs and arbitrary monomer and dimer weights, with the restriction that the\nonly non-zero monomer weights are those on the boundary. We prove a Pfaffian\nformula for the corresponding partition function. As a consequence of this\nresult, multipoint boundary monomer correlation functions at close packing are\nshown to satisfy fermionic statistics. Our proof is based on the celebrated\nKasteleyn theorem, combined with a theorem on Pfaffians proved by one of the\nauthors, and a careful labeling and directing procedure of the vertices and\nedges of the graph.\n", "  Hyperspectral unmixing is aimed at identifying the reference spectral\nsignatures composing an hyperspectral image and their relative abundance\nfractions in each pixel. In practice, the identified signatures may vary\nspectrally from an image to another due to varying acquisition conditions, thus\ninducing possibly significant estimation errors. Against this background,\nhyperspectral unmixing of several images acquired over the same area is of\nconsiderable interest. Indeed, such an analysis enables the endmembers of the\nscene to be tracked and the corresponding endmember variability to be\ncharacterized. Sequential endmember estimation from a set of hyperspectral\nimages is expected to provide improved performance when compared to methods\nanalyzing the images independently. However, the significant size of\nhyperspectral data precludes the use of batch procedures to jointly estimate\nthe mixture parameters of a sequence of hyperspectral images. Provided that\neach elementary component is present in at least one image of the sequence, we\npropose to perform an online hyperspectral unmixing accounting for temporal\nendmember variability. The online hyperspectral unmixing is formulated as a\ntwo-stage stochastic program, which can be solved using a stochastic\napproximation. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on synthetic\nand real data. A comparison with independent unmixing algorithms finally\nillustrates the interest of the proposed strategy.\n", "  We present a magnetically biased graphene-ferrite structure discriminating\nthe TE and TM plasmonic modes of graphene. In this structure, the graphene TM\nplasmons interact reciprocally with the structure. In contrast, the graphene TE\nplasmons exhibit nonreciprocity. This nonreciprocity is manifested in\nunidirectional TE propagation in a frequency band close to the interband\nthreshold frequency. The proposed structure provides a unique platform for the\nexperimental demonstration of the unusual existence of the TE plasmonic mode in\ngraphene.\n", "  We explore some of the cosmological implications of the recent classical\nnonlocal generalization of Einstein's theory of gravitation in which\nnonlocality is due to the gravitational memory of past events. In the Newtonian\nregime of this theory, the nonlocal character of gravity simulates dark matter\nin spiral galaxies and clusters of galaxies. However, dark matter is considered\nindispensable as well for structure formation in standard models of cosmology.\nCan nonlocal gravity solve the problem of structure formation without recourse\nto dark matter? Here we make a beginning in this direction by extending\nnonlocal gravity in the Newtonian regime to the cosmological domain. The\nnonlocal analog of the Zel'dovich solution is formulated and the consequences\nof the resulting nonlocal Zel'dovich model are investigated in detail.\n", "  1. Introduction 2.

We simulate the effect of this anisotropy on the energy transport in an\namorphous many atom system subject to a homogeneous applied electric field. We\nconsider two experimentally feasible geometries and find that the effects\nshould be measurable in current generation imaging experiments. In both\ngeometries atoms of $p$ character are localized to a small region of space\nwhich is immersed in a larger region that is filled with atoms of $s$\ncharacter. Energy transfer due to the dipole-dipole interaction can lead to a\nspread of $p$ character into the region initially occupied by $s$ atoms. Over\nlong timescales the energy transport is confined to the volume near the border\nof the $p$ region which is suggestive of Anderson localization. We calculate a\ncorrelation length of 6.3~$\\mu$m for one particular geometry.\n", "  We provide an example of a 4D theory that exhibits the\nContino-Pomarol-Rattazzi mechanism, where breaking conformal symmetry by an\nalmost marginal operator leads to a light pseudo-Goldstone boson, the dilaton,\nand a parametrically suppressed contribution to vacuum energy. We consider SUSY\nQCD at the edge of the conformal window and break conformal symmetry by weakly\ngauging a subgroup of the flavor symmetry. Using Seiberg duality we show that\nfor a range of parameters the singlet meson in the dual theory reaches the\nunitarity bound, however, this theory does not have a stable vacuum. We\nstabilize the vacuum with soft breaking terms, compute the mass of the dilaton,\nand determine the range of parameters where the leading contribution to the\ndilaton mass is from the almost marginal coupling.\n", "  We discuss the impact of non-standard neutrino matter interactions (NSI) in\npropagation on the determination of CP phase in the context of the long\nbaseline accelerator experiments such as Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment\n(DUNE). DUNE will mainly address the issue of CP violation in the leptonic\nsector. Here we study the role of NSI and its impact on the question of\nobserving the CP violation signal at DUNE. We consider two scenarios of\noscillation with three active neutrinos in absence and presence of NSI. We\nelucidate the importance of ruling out subdominant new physics effects\nintroduced by NSI in inferring CP violation signal at DUNE by considering NSI\nterms collectively as well as by exploiting the non-trivial interplay of moduli\nand phases of the NSI terms. We demonstrate the existence of NSI-SI\ndegeneracies which need to be eliminated in reliable manner in order to make\nconclusive statements about the CP phase.\n", "  Simple Composite Higgs models predict new vector-like fermions not too far\nfrom the electroweak scale, yet LHC limits are now sensitive to the TeV scale.\nMotivated by this tension, we explore the holographic dual of the minimal\nmodel, MCHM5, to understand how far naive 4D predictions are from their 5D\nduals. Interestingly, we find that the usual hierarchy among the vector-like\nquarks is not generic, hence ameliorating the tuning issue. We find that\nlowering the UV cutoff in the 5D picture allows for heavier top partners, while\nkeeping the mass of the Higgs boson at its observed value. In the 4D dual this\ncorresponds to increasing the number of colours. This is essentially a Little\nRandall-Sundrum Model, which are known to reduce some flavour and electroweak\nconstraints. Furthermore, in anticipation of the ongoing efforts at the LHC to\nput bounds on the top Yukawa, we demonstrate that deviations from the SM can be\nsuppressed or enhanced with respect to what is expected from mere symmetry\narguments in 4D. We conclude that the 5D holographic realisation of the MCHM5\nwith a small UV cutoff is not in tension with the current experimental data.\n", "  Hard X-ray observations are crucial to study the non-thermal jet emission\nfrom high-redshift, powerful blazars. We observed two bright z>2 flat spectrum\nradio quasars (FSRQs) in hard X-rays to explore the details of their\nrelativistic jets and their possible variability. S5 0014+81 (at z=3.366) and\nB0222+185 (at z=2.690) have been observed twice by the Nuclear Spectroscopic\nTelescope Array (NuSTAR) simultaneously with Swift/XRT, showing different\nvariability behaviours. We found that NuSTAR is instrumental to explore the\nvariability of powerful high-redshift blazars, even when no gamma-ray emission\nis detected. The two sources have proven to have respectively the most luminous\naccretion disk and the most powerful jet among known blazars. Thanks to these\nproperties, they are located at the extreme end of the jet-accretion disk\nrelation previously found for gamma-ray detected blazars, to which they are\nconsistent.\n", "  We study the phase separation of binary lipid mixtures that form bicontinuous\ncubic phases. The competition between non-uniform Gaussian membrane curvature\nand line tension leads to a very rich phase diagram, where we observe symmetry\nbreaking of the membrane morphologies and reentrant phenomena due to the\nformation of bridges between segregated domains. Upon increasing the line\ntension contribution, we also find facetting of lipid domains that we explain\nusing a simple argument based on the symmetry of the underlying surface and\ntopology.\n", "  Different classical theories are commonly applied in various branches of\nphysics to describe the relativistic dynamics of electrons by coupled equations\nfor the orbital motion and spin precession. Exemplarily, we benchmark the\nFrenkel model and the classical Foldy-Wouthuysen model with spin-dependent\nforces (Stern-Gerlach forces) to the quantum dynamics as predicted by the Dirac\nequation. Both classical theories can lead to different or even contradicting\npredictions how the Stern-Gerlach forces modify the electron's orbital motion,\nwhen the electron moves in strong electromagnetic field configurations of\nemerging high-intensity laser facilities. In this way, one may evaluate the\nvalidity and identify the limits of these classical theories via a comparison\nwith possible experiments to provide a proper description of spin-induced\ndynamics. Our results indicate that the Foldy-Wouhuysen model is qualitatively\nin better agreement with the Dirac theory than the widely used Frenkel model.\n", "  In this paper, we take into account black hole solutions of\nBrans-Dicke-Maxwell theory and investigate their stability and phase transition\npoints. We apply the concept of geometry in thermodynamics to obtain phase\ntransition points and compare its results with those, calculated in canonical\nensemble through heat capacity. We show that these black holes enjoy second\norder phase transitions. We also show that there is a lower bound for the\nhorizon radius of physical charged black holes in Brans-Dicke theory which is\noriginated from restrictions of positivity of temperature. In addition, we find\nthat employing specific thermodynamical metric in the context of geometrical\nthermodynamics, yields divergencies for thermodynamical Ricci scalar in places\nof the phase transitions. It will be pointed out that due to characteristics\nbehavior of thermodynamical Ricci scalar around its divergence points, one is\nable to distinguish the physical limitation point from the phase transitions.\nIn addition, the free energy of these black holes will be obtained and its\nbehavior will be investigated. It will be shown that the behavior of the free\nenergy in the place where the heat capacity diverges, demonstrates second order\nphase transition characteristics.\n", "  Generating entangled photons from a monolithic chip is a major milestone\ntowards real-life applications of optical quantum information processing\nincluding quantum key distribution and quantum computing. Ultrabroadband\nentangled photons are of particular interest to various applications such as\nquantum metrology and multi-party entanglement distribution. In this work, we\ndemonstrate the direct generation of broadband wavelength multiplexed\npolarization entangled photons from a semiconductor chip for the first time.\nWithout the use of any on-chip compensation, interferometry, entangled photons\nwith a signal-idler separation as large as 95 nm in the telecom band were\nobserved. The highest concurrence of 0.98$\\pm$0.01 achieved in this work is\nalso the highest, to the best of our knowledge, comparing to all previously\ndemonstrated semiconductor waveguide sources. This work paves the way for fully\nintegrated, ultrabroadband sources of polarization entangled photons.\n", "  In our quantum mechanics courses, measurement is usually taught in passing,\nas an ad-hoc procedure involving the ugly collapse of the wave function. No\nwonder we search for more satisfying alternatives to the Copenhagen\ninterpretation. But this overlooks the fact that the approach fits very well\nwith modern measurement theory with its notions of the conditioned state and\nquantum trajectory. In addition, what we know of as the Copenhagen\ninterpretation is a later 1950's development and some of the earlier pioneers\nlike Bohr did not talk of wave function collapse. In fact, if one takes these\nearlier ideas and mixes them with later insights of decoherence, a much more\nsatisfying version of Copenhagen quantum mechanics emerges, one for which the\ncollapse of the wave function is seen to be a harmless book keeping device.\nAlong the way, we explain why chaotic systems lead to wave functions that\nspread out quickly on macroscopic scales implying that Schrodinger cat states\nare the norm rather than curiosities generated in physicists' laboratories. We\nthen describe how the conditioned state of a quantum system depends crucially\non how the system is monitored illustrating this with the example of a decaying\natom monitored with a time of arrival photon detector, leading to Bohr's\nquantum jumps. On the other hand, other kinds of detection lead to much\nsmoother behaviour, providing yet another example of complementarity. Finally\nwe explain how classical behaviour emerges, including classical mechanics but\nalso thermodynamics.\n", "  We analytically consider the spontaneous formation of a fermionic crystalline\ngeometry in a gravity background with Lifshitz scaling and/or hyperscaling\nviolation. Fermionic vortex lattice solution sourced by the lowest Laundau\nlevel has been obtained. Thermodynamic analysis shows that the fermionic vortex\nlattice favors a triangular configuration, regardless of the values of the\nLifshitz scaling $z$ and the hyperscaling violation exponent $\\theta$. Our\nresults also show that the larger $z$ or lower $\\theta$ leads to more stable\nlattices thermodynamically.\n", "  The scaling of active photonic devices to deep-submicron length-scales has\nbeen hampered by the fundamental diffraction limit and the absence of materials\nwith sufficiently strong electro-optic effects. Here, we demonstrate a solid\nstate electro-optical switching mechanism that can operate in the visible\nspectral range with an unparalleled active volume of less than 5 nm cube,\ncomparable to the size of the smallest electronic components. The switching\nmechanism relies on electrochemically displacing metal atoms inside the\nnanometer-scale gap to electrically connect two crossed metallic wires forming\na crosspoint junction. Such junctions afford extreme light concentration and\ndisplay singular optical behavior upon formation of a conductive channel. We\nillustrate how this effect can be used to actively tune the resonances of\nplasmonic antennas. The tuning mechanism is analyzed using a combination of\nelectrical and optical measurements as well as electron energy loss (EELS) in a\nscanning transmission electron microscope (STEM).\n", "  The cross sections for the reaction $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow 4\\ell$ in\nproton--proton collisions are calculated at the LHC energies. We show that the\npurely electroweak process $\\gamma\\gamma\\rightarrow 4\\ell$ can be studied at\nthe LHC and can constitute a background to other processes with $4\\ell$ or\n$2\\ell$ final states.\n", "  We derive thermodynamic functionals for spatially inhomogeneous magnetization\non a torus in the context of an Ising spin lattice model. We calculate the\ncorresponding free energy and pressure (by applying an appropriate external\nfield using a quadratic Kac potential) and show that they are related via a\nmodified Legendre transform. The local properties of the infinite volume Gibbs\nmeasure, related to whether a macroscopic configuration is realized as a\nhomogeneous state or as a mixture of pure states, are also studied by\nconstructing the corresponding Young-Gibbs measures.\n", "  We investigate effects of the filled Dirac sea on the $SU(4)$ symmetry\nbreaking in the integer quantum Hall states of graphene with long-ranged\nCoulomb interactions. Our model also includes Hubbard and nearest neighbour\nrepulsive interactions with strengths $U$ and $V$ respectively. We find that\nthe symmetry breaking of the $n=0$ Landau levels induces an $SU(4)$\npolarization of the Dirac sea. This results in several phases which are absent\nwhen the effects of the Dirac sea are neglected. We compute the phase diagram\nin the $U$-$V$ space. We also calculate the excitation gaps in tilted magnetic\nfields for all the phases. We compare our model results with experiments and\nfind a range of $U$ and $V$ that are consistent with them.\n", "  Massive black holes (MBHs) are nowadays recognized as integral parts of\ngalaxy evolution. Both the approximate proportionality between MBH and galaxy\nmass, and the expected importance of feedback from active MBHs in regulating\nstar formation in their host galaxies point to a strong interplay between MBHs\nand galaxies. MBHs must form in the first galaxies and be fed by gas in these\ngalaxies, with continuous or intermittent inflows that, at times, can be larger\nthan the Eddington rate. Feedback from supernovae and from the MBHs themselves\nmodulates the growth of the first MBHs. While current observational data only\nprobe the most massive and luminous MBHs, the tip of the iceberg, we will soon\nbe able to test theoretical models of MBH evolution on more \"normal\" MBHs: the\nMBHs that are indeed relevant in building the population that we observe in\nlocal galaxies, including our own Milky Way.\n", "  Supermassive black hole accretion and feedback play central role in the\nevolution of galaxies, groups, and clusters. I review how AGN feedback is\ntightly coupled with the formation of multiphase gas and the newly probed\nchaotic cold accretion (CCA). In a turbulent and heated atmosphere, cold clouds\nand kpc-scale filaments condense out of the plasma via thermal instability and\nrain toward the black hole. In the nucleus, the recurrent chaotic collisions\nbetween the cold clouds, filaments, and central torus promote angular momentum\ncancellation or mixing, boosting the accretion rate up to 100 times the Bondi\nrate. The rapid variability triggers powerful AGN outflows, which quench the\ncooling flow and star formation without destroying the cool core. The AGN\nheating stifles the formation of multiphase gas and accretion, the feedback\nsubsides and the hot halo is allowed to cool again, restarting a new cycle.\nUltimately, CCA creates a symbiotic link between the black hole and the whole\nhost via a tight self-regulated feedback which preserves the gaseous halo in\nglobal thermal equilibrium throughout cosmic time.\n", "  Microscopic studies of superconductors and their vortices play a pivotal role\nin our understanding of the mechanisms underlying superconductivity. Local\nmeasurements of penetration depths or magnetic stray-fields enable access to\nfundamental aspects of superconductors such as nanoscale variations of\nsuperfluid densities or the symmetry of their order parameter. However,\nexperimental tools, which offer quantitative, nanoscale magnetometry and\noperate over the large range of temperature and magnetic fields relevant to\naddress many outstanding questions in superconductivity, are still missing.\nHere, we demonstrate quantitative, nanoscale magnetic imaging of Pearl vortices\nin the cuprate superconductor YBCO, using a scanning quantum sensor in form of\na single Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) electronic spin in diamond. The sensor-to-sample\ndistance of ~10nm we achieve allows us to observe striking deviations from the\nprevalent monopole approximation in our vortex stray-field images, while we\nfind excellent quantitative agreement with Pearl's analytic model. Our\nexperiments yield a non-invasive and unambiguous determination of the system's\nlocal London penetration depth, and are readily extended to higher temperatures\nand magnetic fields. These results demonstrate the potential of quantitative\nquantum sensors in benchmarking microscopic models of complex electronic\nsystems and open the door for further exploration of strongly correlated\nelectron physics using scanning NV magnetometry.\n", "  We investigate the properties of quarks and gluons above the chiral phase\ntransition temperature $T_c,$ using the RG improved gauge action and the Wilson\nquark action with two degenerate quarks mainly on a $32^3\\times 16$ lattice. In\nthe one-loop perturbation theory, the thermal ensemble is dominated by the\ngauge configurations with effectively $Z(3)$ center twisted boundary\nconditions, making the thermal expectation value of the spatial Polyakov loop\ntake a non-trivial $Z(3)$ center. This is in agreement with our lattice\nsimulation of high temperature QCD. We further observe that the temporal\npropagator of massless quarks at extremely high temperature $\\beta=100.0 \\, (T\n\\simeq10^{58} T_c)$ remarkably agrees with the temporal propagator of free\nquarks with the $Z(3)$ twisted boundary condition for $t/L_t \\geq 0.2$, but\ndiffers from that with the $Z(3)$ trivial boundary condition. As we increase\nthe mass of quarks $m_q$, we find that the thermal ensemble continues to be\ndominated by the $Z(3)$ twisted gauge field configurations as long as $m_q \\le\n3.0 \\, T$ and above that the $Z(3)$ trivial configurations come in. The\ntransition is essentially identical to what we found in the departure from the\nconformal region in the zero-temperature many-flavor conformal QCD on a finite\nlattice by increasing the mass of quarks. We argue that the behavior is\nconsistent with the renormalization group analysis at finite temperature.\n", "  A nonlinear oscillator model with negative time-delayed feedback is studied\nnumeri- cally under external deterministic and stochastic forcing. It is found\nthat in the unforced system complex partial synchronization patterns like\nchimera states as well as salt-and-pepper like soli- tary states arise on the\nroute from regular dynamics to spatio-temporal chaos. The control of the\ndynamics by external periodic forcing is demonstrated by numerical simulations.\nIt is shown that one-cluster and multi-cluster chimeras can be achieved by\nadjusting the external forcing frequency to appropriate resonance conditions.\nIf a stochastic component is superimposed to the determin- istic external\nforcing, chimera states can be induced in a way similar to stochastic\nresonance, they appear, therefore, in regimes where they do not exist without\nnoise.\n", "  We prove the quantization of the Hall conductivity for general weakly\ninteracting gapped fermionic systems on two-dimensional periodic lattices. The\nproof is based on fermionic cluster expansion techniques combined with lattice\nWard identities, and on a reconstruction theorem that allows us to compute the\nKubo conductivity as the analytic continuation of its imaginary time\ncounterpart.\n", "  The Robertson -- Schr\\\"{o}dinger, Heisenberg -- Robertson and Trifonov\nuncertainty relations for arbitrary two functions $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ depending\non the quantum phase and the number of photons respectively, are given.\nIntelligent states and states which minimize locally the product of\nuncertainties $(\\Delta f_{1})^{2}\\cdot (\\Delta f_{2})^{2}$ or the sum $(\\Delta\nf_{1})^{2}+(\\Delta f_{2})^{2}$ are investigated for the cases\n$f_{1}=\\phi,\\exp{(i\\phi)}, \\exp{(-i\\phi)}, \\cos{\\phi}, \\sin{\\phi}$ and\n$f_{2}=n$.\n", "  Elliptic partial differential equations (ePDEs) appear in a wide variety of\nareas of mathematics, physics and engineering. Typically, ePDEs must be solved\nnumerically, which sets an ever growing demand for efficient and highly\nparallel algorithms to tackle their computational solution. The Scheduled\nRelaxation Jacobi (SRJ) is a promising class of methods, atypical for combining\nsimplicity and efficiency, that has been recently introduced for solving linear\nPoisson-like ePDEs. The SRJ methodology relies on computing the appropriate\nparameters of a multilevel approach with the goal of minimizing the number of\niterations needed to cut down the residuals below specified tolerances. The\nefficiency in the reduction of the residual increases with the number of levels\nemployed in the algorithm. Applying the original methodology to compute the\nalgorithm parameters with more than 5 levels notably hinders obtaining optimal\nSRJ schemes, as the mixed (non-linear) algebraic-differential equations from\nwhich they result become notably stiff. Here we present a new methodology for\nobtaining the parameters of SRJ schemes that overcomes the limitations of the\noriginal algorithm and provide parameters for SRJ schemes with up to 15 levels\nand resolutions of up to $2^{15}$ points per dimension, allowing for\nacceleration factors larger than several hundreds with respect to the Jacobi\nmethod for typical resolutions and, in some high resolution cases, close to\n1000. Furthermore, we extend the original algorithm to apply it to certain\nsystems of non-linear ePDEs.\n", "  Motivated by a solution to the strong CP problem we propose a model where a\nnew heavy neutral CP-even Higgs boson couples to vector-like quarks enhancing\nits production cross section whose dominant decays are into weak bosons. The\nmasses of the vector-like quarks are generated through interactions with a\nsinglet scalar field charged under a broken global $U(1)$ symmetry providing a\nsolution to the strong CP problem by means of the Peccei-Quinn mechanism. The\ndiboson excess observed by the ATLAS Collaboration is discussed as the new\nheavy Higgs boson is a candidate to explain a possible signal in this channel.\nWe also show that the 14 TeV LHC is capable of discovering this heavy Higgs\nwith masses up to 1 TeV in the $H\\to ZZ\\to \\ell^+\\ell^-\\ell^{\\prime\n+}\\ell^{\\prime -}$ search channel using boosted decision trees to better\ndiscriminate between signals and backgrounds and to tame systematic\nuncertainties in the background rates.\n", "  Non-commutative geometry naturally emerges in low energy physics of Landau\nmodels as a consequence of level projection. In this work, we proactively\nutilize the level projection as an effective tool to generate fuzzy geometry.\nThe level projection is specifically applied to the relativistic Landau models.\nIn the first half of the paper, a detail analysis of the relativistic Landau\nproblems on a sphere is presented, where a concise expression of the\nDirac-Landau operator eigenstates is obtained based on algebraic methods. We\nestablish $SU(2)$ \"gauge\" transformation between the relativistic Landau model\nand the Pauli-Schr\\\"odinger non-relativistic quantum mechanics. After the\n$SU(2)$ transformation, the Dirac operator and the angular momentum operastors\nare found to satisfy the $SO(3,1)$ algebra. In the second half, the fuzzy\ngeometries generated from the relativistic Landau levels are elucidated, where\nunique properties of the relativistic fuzzy geometries are clarified. We\nconsider mass deformation of the relativistic Landau models and demonstrate its\ngeometrical effects to fuzzy geometry. Super fuzzy geometry is also constructed\nfrom a supersymmetric quantum mechanics as the square of the Dirac-Landau\noperator. Finally, we apply the level projection method to real graphene system\nto generate valley fuzzy spheres.\n", "  Given a matrix polynomial $W(x)$, matrix bi-orthogonal polynomials with\nrespect to the sesquilinear form $\\langle P(x),Q(x)\\rangle_W=\\int P(x)\nW(x)\\operatorname{d}\\mu(x)(Q(x))^{\\top}$, $P(x),Q(x)\\in\\mathbb R^{p\\times\np}[x]$, where $\\mu(x)$ is a matrix of Borel measures supported in some infinite\nsubset of the real line, are considered. Connection formulas between the\nsequences of matrix bi-orthogonal polynomials with respect to $\\langle\n\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle_W$ and matrix polynomials orthogonal with respect to\n$\\mu(x)$ are presented. In particular, for the case of nonsingular leading\ncoefficients of the perturbation matrix polynomial $W(x)$ we present a\ngeneralization of the Christoffel formula constructed in terms of the Jordan\nchains of $W(x)$. For perturbations with a singular leading coefficient several\nexamples by Dur\\'an et al are revisited. Finally, we extend these results to\nthe non-Abelian 2D Toda lattice hierarchy.\n", "  In this work a novel approach is presented for the isogeometric Boundary\nElement analysis of domains that contain inclusions with different elastic\nproperties than the ones used for computing the fundamental solutions. In\naddition the inclusion may exhibit inelastic material behavior. In this paper\nonly plane stress/strain problems are considered.\n  In our approach the geometry of the inclusion is described using NURBS basis\nfunctions. The advantage over currently used methods is that no discretization\ninto cells is required in order to evaluate the arising volume integrals. The\nother difference to current approaches is that Kernels of lower singularity are\nused in the domain term. The implementation is verified on simple finite and\ninfinite domain examples with various boundary conditions. Finally a practical\napplication in geomechanics is presented.\n", "  By using Meng's idea in his generalization of the classical MICZ-Kepler\nproblem, we obtained the equations of motion of a charged particle in the field\nof generalized Dirac monopole in odd dimensional Euclidean spaces. The main\nresult is that for every particle trajectory $\\mathbf{r}: I\\to\\mathbb{R}^{2k+1}\n\\setminus \\{0\\}$, there is a 2-dimensional cone with vertex at the origin on\nwhich $\\mathbf{r}$ is a~geodesic.\n", "  Building a quantum repeater network for long distance quantum communication\nrequires photons and quantum registers that comprise qubits for interaction\nwith light, good memory capabilities and processing qubits for storage and\nmanipulation of photons. Here we demonstrate a key step, the coherent transfer\nof a photon in a single solid-state nuclear spin qubit with an average fidelity\nof 98% and storage over 10 seconds. The storage process is achieved by\ncoherently transferring a photon to an entangled electron-nuclear spin state of\na nitrogen vacancy centre in diamond, confirmed by heralding through high\nfidelity single-shot readout of the electronic spin states. Stored photon\nstates are robust against repetitive optical writing operations, required for\nrepeater nodes. The photon-electron spin interface and the nuclear spin memory\ndemonstrated here constitutes a major step towards practical quantum networks,\nand surprisingly also paves the way towards a novel entangled photon source for\nphotonic quantum computing.\n", "  Light shifts are an important source of noise and systematics in optically\npumped magnetometers. We demonstrate that the long spin coherence time in\nparaffin-coated cells leads to spatial averaging of the light shifts over the\nentire cell volume. This renders the averaged light shift independent, under\ncertain approximations, of the light-intensity distribution within the sensor\ncell. These results and the underlying mechanism can be extended to other\nspatially varying phenomena in anti-relaxation-coated cells with long coherence\ntimes.\n", "  We present a scheme for universal quantum computing using XY Heisenberg spin\nchains. Information is encoded into packets propagating down these chains, and\nthey interact with each other to perform universal quantum computation. A\ncircuit using g gate blocks on m qubits can be encoded into chains of length\n$O(g^{3+\\delta} m^{3+\\delta})$ for all $\\delta >0$ with vanishingly small\nerror.\n", "  This paper presents three hyperspectral mixture models jointly with Bayesian\nalgorithms for supervised hyperspectral unmixing. Based on the residual\ncomponent analysis model, the proposed general formulation assumes the linear\nmodel to be corrupted by an additive term whose expression can be adapted to\naccount for nonlinearities (NL), endmember variability (EV), or mismodelling\neffects (ME). The NL effect is introduced by considering a polynomial\nexpression that is related to bilinear models. The proposed new formulation of\nEV accounts for shape and scale endmember changes while enforcing a smooth\nspectral/spatial variation. The ME formulation takes into account the effect of\noutliers and copes with some types of EV and NL. The known constraints on the\nparameter of each observation model are modeled via suitable priors. The\nposterior distribution associated with each Bayesian model is optimized using a\ncoordinate descent algorithm which allows the computation of the maximum a\nposteriori estimator of the unknown model parameters. The proposed mixture and\nBayesian models and their estimation algorithms are validated on both synthetic\nand real images showing competitive results regarding the quality of the\ninferences and the computational complexity when compared to the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.\n", "  The gravito-inertial waves propagating over a shellular baroclinic flow\ninside a rotating spherical shell are analysed using the Boussinesq\napproximation. The wave properties are examined by computing paths of\ncharacteristics in the non-dissipative limit, and by solving the full\ndissipative eigenvalue problem using a high-resolution spectral method.\nGravito-inertial waves are found to obey a mixed-type second-order operator and\nto be often focused around short-period attractors of characteristics or\ntrapped in a wedge formed by turning surfaces and boundaries. We also find\neigenmodes that show a weak dependence with respect to viscosity and heat\ndiffusion just like truly regular modes. Some axisymmetric modes are found\nunstable and likely destabilized by baroclinic instabilities. Similarly, some\nnon-axisymmetric modes that meet a critical layer (or corotation resonance) can\nturn unstable at sufficiently low diffusivities. In all cases, the instability\nis driven by the differential rotation. For many modes of the spectrum, neat\npower laws are found for the dependence of the damping rates with diffusion\ncoefficients, but the theoretical explanation for the exponent values remains\nelusive in general. The eigenvalue spectrum turns out to be very rich and\ncomplex, which lets us suppose an even richer and more complex spectrum for\nrotating stars or planets that own a differential rotation driven by\nbaroclinicity.\n", "  The common real-world feature of individuals migrating through a network --\neither in real space or online -- significantly complicates understanding of\nnetwork processes. Here we show that even though a network may appear static on\naverage, underlying nodal mobility can dramatically distort outbreak profiles.\nHighly nonlinear dynamical regimes emerge in which increasing mobility either\namplifies or suppresses outbreak severity. Predicted profiles mimic recent\noutbreaks of real-space contagion (social unrest) and online contagion\n(pro-ISIS support). We show that this nodal mobility can be renormalized in a\nprecise way for a particular class of dynamical networks.\n", "  The strangeness $S=-2$ baryon-baryon interaction is studied in chiral\neffective field theory up to next-to-leading order. The potential at this order\nconsists of contributions from one- and two-pseudoscalar-meson exchange\ndiagrams and from four-baryon contact terms without and with two derivatives.\nSU(3) flavor symmetry is imposed for constructing the interaction in the $S=-2$\nsector. Specifically, the couplings of the pseudoscalar mesons to the baryons\nare fixed by SU(3) symmetry and, in general, also the contact terms are related\nvia SU(3) symmetry to those determined in a previous study of the $S=-1$\nhyperon-nucleon interaction. The explicit SU(3) symmetry breaking due to the\nphysical masses of the pseudoscalar mesons ($\\pi$, $K$, $\\eta$) is taken into\naccount. It is argued that the $\\Xi N$ interaction has to be relatively weak to\nbe in accordance with available experimental constraints. In particular, the\npublished values and upper bounds for the $\\Xi^- p$ elastic and inelastic cross\nsections apparently rule out a somewhat stronger attractive $\\Xi N$ force and,\nspecifically, disfavor any near-threshold deuteron-like bound states in that\nsystem.\n", "  Within the framework of the LHC Injector Upgrade (LIU), the new LINAC4 is\ncurrently being commissioned to replace the existing LINAC2 proton source at\nCERN. After the expected completion at the end of 2016, the LINAC4 will\naccelerate H- ions to 160 MeV. To measure the transverse emittance of the H-\nbeam, a method based on photo-detachment is proposed. This system will operate\nusing a pulsed laser with light delivered via an optical fibre and subsequently\nfocused through a thin slice of the H- beam. The laser photons have sufficient\nenergy to detach the outer electron and create H0/e- pairs. In a downstream\ndipole, the created H0 particles are separated from the unstripped H- ions and\ntheir distribution is measured with a dedicated detector. By scanning the\nfocused laser across the H- beam, the transverse emittance of the H- beam can\nbe reconstructed. This paper will first discuss the concept, design and\nsimulations of the laser\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to provide a formula for the effective diffusion\noperator obtained by projecting the 3-dimensional diffusion equation onto a\n2-dimensional plane, assuming reflective boundary conditions at two surfaces in\n3-dimensional space. The formula provided corresponds to the case of finite\ntransversal stabilization rate.\n", "  We study the heavy-heavy-light (HHL) three-point functions in the planar N =\n4 super-Yang- Mills theory using the recently proposed hexagon bootstrap\nprogram [arXiv:1505.06745]. We prove the conjecture of Bajnok, Janik and\nWereszczynski [arXiv:1404.4556] on the polynomial L-dependence of HHL structure\nconstant up to the leading finite-size corrections, where L is the length of\nthe heavy operators. The proof is presented for a specific set-up but the\nmethod can be applied to more general situations.\n", "  Symmetrically bonded thin and flexible T-peel specimens, when tested on\nvertical travel machines, can be subject to significant gravitational loading;\nwith the associated asymmetry and mixed-mode failure during peeling. This can\ncause erroneously high experimental peel forces to be recorded which leads to\nuncertainty in estimating interfacial fracture toughness and failure mode. To\novercome these issues, a mechanical test fixture has been designed for use with\nvertical test machines, that supports the unpeeled portion of the test specimen\nand suppresses parasitic loads due to gravity from affecting the peel test. The\nmechanism, driven by the test machine cross-head, moves at one-half of the\nvelocity of the cross-head such that the unpeeled portion always lies in the\nplane of the instantaneous center of motion. Several specimens such as bonded\npolymeric films, laminates, and commercial tapes were tested with and without\nthe fixture, and the importance of the proposed T-peel procedure has been\ndemonstrated.\n", "  The possibility of optimization of high voltage hybrid SIT-MOS transistors\n(HSMT) by local reduction of the lifetime near anode emitter and/or reduction\nof the anode emitter injection ability by three different ways has been\ninvestigated using two-dimensional numerical simulation. It has been shown that\nall of these methods proposed previously for optimization of insulated-gate\nbipolar transistor (IGBT) are physically equivalent and makes it possible to\nreduce turn-off energy losses $E_{off}$ in HSMT by 30-40%. Importantly that\nenergy $E_{off}$ in optimized HSMT appears to be 15-35% less than in equivalent\ntrench IGBT under other equal conditions.\n", "  We propose a field theoretic framework for calculating the dependence of\nR\\'enyi entropies on the shape of the entangling surface in a conformal field\ntheory. Our approach rests on regarding the corresponding twist operator as a\nconformal defect and in particular, we define the displacement operator which\nimplements small local deformations of the entangling surface. We identify a\nsimple constraint between the coefficient defining the two-point function of\nthe displacement operator and the conformal weight of the twist operator, which\nconsolidates a number of distinct conjectures on the shape dependence of the\nR\\'enyi entropy. As an example, using this approach, we examine a conjecture\nregarding the universal coefficient associated with a conical singularity in\nthe entangling surface for CFTs in any number of spacetime dimensions. We also\nprovide a general formula for the second order variation of the R\\'enyi entropy\narising from small deformations of a spherical entangling surface, extending\nMezei's results for the entanglement entropy.\n", "  In the experiment of flash-radiography, the quality of acquired image\nstrongly depends on the focal size of the x-ray source spot. A variety of\ntechniques based on imaging of pinhole, slit and rollbar are adopted to measure\nthe focal spot size of the Dragon-I linear induction accelerator. The image of\npinhole provides a two-dimensional distribution of the x-ray spot, while those\nof slit and rollbar give a line-spread distribution and an edge-spread\ndistribution, respectively. The spot size characterized by full-width at\nhalf-maximum and that characterized by the LANL definition are calculated for\ncomparison.\n", "  Leveraging the unrivaled performance of optical clocks in applications in\nfundamental physics beyond the standard model, in geo-sciences, and in\nastronomy requires comparing the frequency of distant optical clocks\ntruthfully. Meeting this requirement, we report on the first comparison and\nagreement of fully independent optical clocks separated by 700 km being only\nlimited by the uncertainties of the clocks themselves. This is achieved by a\nphase-coherent optical frequency transfer via a 1415 km long telecom fiber link\nthat enables substantially better precision than classical means of frequency\ntransfer. The fractional precision in comparing the optical clocks of three\nparts in $10^{17}$ was reached after only 1000 s averaging time, which is\nalready 10 times better and more than four orders of magnitude faster than with\nany other existing frequency transfer method. The capability of performing high\nresolution international clock comparisons paves the way for a redefinition of\nthe unit of time and an all-optical dissemination of the SI-second.\n", "  The formation energy of the interface between face-centered cubic (fcc) and\nhexagonal close packed (hcp) structures is a key parameter in determining the\nstacking fault energy (SFE) of fcc metals and alloys using thermodynamic\ncalculations. Often the contribution of the planar fault energy to the SFE has\nthe same order of magnitude as the bulk part, and thus the lack of a precise\ninformation about it can become the limiting factor in thermodynamic\npredictions. Here, we differentiate between the actual interfacial energy for\nthe coherent fcc(111)/hcp(0001) interface and the \"pseudo-interfacial energy\"\nthat enters the thermodynamic expression for the SFE. Using first-principles\ncalculations, we determine the coherent and pseudo- interfacial energies for\nsix elemental metals (Al, Ni, Cu, Ag, Pt, and Au) and for three paramagnetic\nFe-Cr-Ni alloys. Our results show that the two interfacial energies\nsignificantly differ from each other. We observe a strong chemistry dependence\nof both interfacial energies. The calculated pseudo-interfacial energies for\nthe Fe-Cr-Ni steels agree well with the available literature data.\n", "  Sensing and imaging are among the most important applications of quantum\ninformation science. To investigate their fundamental limits and the\npossibility of quantum enhancements, researchers have for decades relied on the\nquantum Cram\\'er-Rao lower error bounds pioneered by Helstrom. Recent work,\nhowever, has called into question the tightness of those bounds for highly\nnonclassical states in the non-asymptotic regime, and better methods are now\nneeded to assess the attainable quantum limits in reality. Here we propose a\nnew class of quantum bounds called quantum Weiss-Weinstein bounds, which\ninclude Cram\\'er-Rao-type inequalities as special cases but can also be\nsignificantly tighter to the attainable error. We demonstrate the superiority\nof our bounds through the derivation of a Heisenberg limit and phase-estimation\nexamples.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of drop impact on a thin liquid film at short\ntimes in order to identify the mechanisms of splashing formation. Using\nnumerical simulations and scaling analysis, we show that the splashing\nformation depends both on the inertial dynamics of the liquid and the\ncushioning of the gas. Two asymptotic regimes are identified, characterized by\na new dimensionless number $J$: when the gas cushioning is weak, the jet is\nformed after a sequence of bubbles are entrapped and the jet speed is mostly\nselected by the Reynolds number of the impact. On the other hand, when the air\ncushioning is important, the lubrication of the gas beneath the drop and the\nliquid film controls the dynamics, leading to a single bubble entrapment and a\nweaker jet velocity.\n", "  We derive medium-induced splitting kernels for energetic partons that undergo\ninteractions in dense QCD matter before a hard-scattering event at large\nmomentum transfer $Q^2$. Working in the framework of the effective theory ${\\rm\nSCET}_{\\rm G}\\,$, we compute the splitting kernels beyond the soft gluon\napproximation. We present numerical studies that compare our new results with\nprevious findings. We expect the full medium-induced splitting kernels to be\nmost relevant for the extension of initial-state cold nuclear matter energy\nloss phenomenology in both p+A and A+A collisions.\n", "  WASP-12b and Qatar-1b are transiting Hot Jupiters for which previous works\nhave suggested the presence of transit timing variations (TTVs) indicative of\nadditional bodies in these systems - an Earth-mass planet in WASP-12 and a\nbrown-dwarf mass object in Qatar-1. Here, we present 23 new WASP-12b and 18 new\nQatar-1b complete (or nearly complete) transit observations. We perform global\nsystem fits to all of our light curves for each system, plus RV and stellar\nspectroscopic parameters from the literature. The global fits provide refined\nsystem parameters and uncertainties for each system, including precise transit\ncenter times for each transit. The transit model residuals of the combined and\nfive minute binned light curves have a RMS of 183 and 255 parts per million\n(ppm) for WASP-12b and Qatar-1b, respectively. Most WASP-12b system parameter\nvalues from this work are consistent with values from previous studies, but\nhave $\\sim$ 40-50% smaller uncertainties. Most of the Qatar-1b system parameter\nvalues and uncertainties from this work are consistent with values recently\nreported in the literature. We find no convincing evidence for sinusoidal TTVs\nwith a semi-amplitude of more than $\\sim$ 35 s and $\\sim$ 25 s in the WASP-12b\nand Qatar-1b systems, respectively.\n", "  The effects of the resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) on the turbulent\ntransport are analyzed in the framework of the test particle approach using a\nsemi-analytical method. The normalized RMP amplitude $P_{b}$ extends on a large\nrange, from the present experiments to ITER conditions. The results are in\nagreement with the experiments at small $P_{b}.$ The predictions for ITER\nstrongly depend on the type of turbulent transport. A very strong increase of\nthe turbulent transport is obtained in the nonlinear regime, while the effects\nof the RMPs are much weaker for the quasilinear transport.\n", "  We propose a renormalisable model based on $\\Delta(27)$ family symmetry with\nan $SO(10)$ grand unified theory (GUT) leading to a novel form of spontaneous\ngeometrical CP violation. The symmetries, including $\\Delta(27)$ and\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{9} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{4}^{R}$, are broken\nclose to the GUT breaking scale to yield the minimal supersymmetric standard\nmodel (MSSM) with the standard R-parity. $SO(10)$ is broken via $SU(5)$ with\ndoublet-triplet splitting achieved by a version of the Dimopoulos-Wilczek\n(missing VEV) mechanism. Low-scale Yukawa structure is dictated by the coupling\nof matter to $ \\Delta(27) $ antitriplets $ \\bar{\\phi} $ whose VEVs are aligned\nin the CSD3 directions by the superpotential. Light physical Majorana neutrinos\nmasses emerge from a specific implementation of the seesaw mechanism within\n$SO(10)$. The model predicts a normal neutrino mass hierarchy with the best-fit\nlightest neutrino mass $ m_1 = 0.13 $ meV and the PMNS mixing parameters\n$\\theta^l_{13} \\approx 8.35^{\\circ}$, $\\theta^l_{12}\\approx 34^{\\circ}$,\n$\\theta^l_{23}\\approx 43^{\\circ}$ and an oscillation phase $\\delta^l\\approx\n-90^{\\circ}$.\n", "  Randomly coupled Ising spins constitute the classical model of collective\nphenomena in disordered systems, with applications covering ferromagnetism,\ncombinatorial optimization, protein folding, stock market dynamics, and social\ndynamics. The phase diagram of these systems is obtained in the thermodynamic\nlimit by averaging over the quenched randomness of the couplings. However, many\napplications require the statistics of activity for a single realization of the\npossibly asymmetric couplings in finite-sized networks. Examples include\nreconstruction of couplings from the observed dynamics, learning in the central\nnervous system by correlation-sensitive synaptic plasticity, and representation\nof probability distributions for sampling-based inference. The systematic\ncumulant expansion for kinetic binary (Ising) threshold units with strong,\nrandom and asymmetric couplings presented here goes beyond mean-field theory\nand is applicable outside thermodynamic equilibrium; a system of approximate\nnon-linear equations predicts average activities and pairwise covariances in\nquantitative agreement with full simulations down to hundreds of units. The\nlinearized theory yields an expansion of the correlation- and response\nfunctions in collective eigenmodes, leads to an efficient algorithm solving the\ninverse problem, and shows that correlations are invariant under scaling of the\ninteraction strengths.\n", "  We point out that a successful inflationary magnetogenesis could be realised\nif we break the local U(1) gauge symmetry during inflation. The effective\nelectric charge is fixed as a fundamental constant, which allows us to obtain\nan almost scale invariant magnetic spectrum avoiding both the strong coupling\nand back reaction problems. We examine the corrections to the primordial\ncurvature perturbation due to these stochastic electromagnetic fields and find\nthat, at both linear and non-linear orders, the contributions from the\nelectromagnetic field are negligible compared to those created from vacuum\nfluctuations. Finally, the U(1) gauge symmetry is restored at the end of\ninflation.\n", "  Several models of gamma-ray burst progenitors suggest that the gamma-ray\nevent may be followed by gravitational wave signals of $10^3$-$10^4$ seconds\nduration (possibly accompanying the so-called X-ray afterglow \"plateaus\"). We\nterm these signals \"intermediate-duration\" because they are shorter than\ncontinuous wave signals but longer than signals traditionally considered as\ngravitational wave bursts, and are difficult to detect with most burst and\ncontinuous wave methods. The cross-correlation technique proposed by [S.\nDhurandhar et al., Phys. Rev. D 77, 082001 (2008)], which so far has been used\nonly on continuous wave signals, in principle unifies both burst and continuous\nwave (as well as matched filtering and stochastic background) methods, reducing\nthem to different choices of which data to correlate on which time scales. Here\nwe perform the first tuning of this cross-correlation technique to\nintermediate-duration signals. We derive theoretical estimates of sensitivity\nin Gaussian noise in different limits of the cross-correlation formalism, and\ncompare them to the performance of a prototype search code on simulated\nGaussian-noise data. We estimate that the code is likely able to detect\n\\emph{some} classes of intermediate-duration signals (such as the ones\ndescribed in [A. Corsi \\& P. M\\'esz\\'aros, Astrophys. J., 702, 1171 (2009)])\nfrom sources located at astrophysically-relevant distances of several tens of\nMpc.\n", "  We point out that the MERA network for the ground state of a 1+1-dimensional\nconformal field theory has the same structural features as kinematic\nspace---the geometry of CFT intervals. In holographic theories kinematic space\nbecomes identified with the space of bulk geodesics studied in integral\ngeometry. We argue that in these settings MERA is best viewed as a\ndiscretization of the space of bulk geodesics rather than of the bulk geometry\nitself. As a test of this kinematic proposal, we compare the MERA\nrepresentation of the thermofield-double state with the space of geodesics in\nthe two-sided BTZ geometry, obtaining a detailed agreement which includes the\nentwinement sector. We discuss how the kinematic proposal can be extended to\nexcited states by generalizing MERA to a broader class of compression networks.\n", "  In this work we study the behaviour of two weakly coupled quantum systems,\ndescribed by a separable density operator; one of them is a single oscillator,\nrepresenting a microscopic system, while the other is a set of oscillators\nwhich perform the role of a \\emph{reservoir} in thermal equilibrium. From the\nLiouville-Von Neumann equation for the reduced density operator, we devise the\nmaster equation that governs the evolution of the microscopic system,\nincorporating the effects of temperature via Thermofield Dynamics formalism by\nsuitably redefining the vacuum of the macroscopic system. As applications, we\ninitially investigate the behaviour of a Fermi oscillator in the presence of a\nheat bath consisting of a set of Fermi oscillators and that of an atomic\ntwo-level system interacting with a scalar radiation field, considered as a\n\\emph{reservoir}, by constructing the corresponding master equation which\ngoverns the time evolution of both sub-systems at finite temperature. Finally,\nwe calculate the energy variation rates for the atom and the field, as well as\nthe atomic population levels, both in the inertial case and at constant proper\nacceleration, considering the two-level system as a prototype of an Unruh\ndetector, for admissible couplings of the radiation field.\n", "  In the solar atmosphere, jets are prevalent and they are significant for the\nmass and energy transport. Here we conduct numerical simulations to investigate\nthe mass and energy contributions of the recently observed high-speed jets to\nthe solar wind. With a one-dimensional hydrodynamic solar wind model, the\ntime-dependent pulses are imposed at the bottom to simulate the jets. The\nsimulation results show that without other energy source, the injected plasmas\nare accelerated effectively to be a transonic wind with a substantial mass\nflux. The rapid acceleration occurs close to the Sun, and the resulting\nasymptotic speed, number density at 0.3 AU, as well as mass flux normalized to\n1 AU are compatible with in situ observations. As a result of the high speed,\nthe imposed pulses generate a train of shocks traveling upward. By tracing the\nmotions of the injected plasma, it is found that these shocks heat and\naccelerate the injected plasmas successively step by step to push them upward\nand eventually allow them to escape. The parametric studies show that\nincreasing the speed of the imposed pulses or their temperature gives a\nconsiderably faster, and hotter solar wind, while increasing their number\ndensity or decreasing their recurring period only bring a denser solar wind.\nThese studies provide a possibility that the ubiquitous high-speed jets are a\nsubstantial mass and energy contributions to the solar wind.\n", "  In the solar atmosphere, the jets are ubiquitous and found to be at various\nspatia-temporal scales. They are significant to understand energy and mass\ntransport in the solar atmosphere. Recently, the high-speed transition region\njets are reported from the observation. Here we conduct a numerical simulation\nto investigate the mechanism in their formation. Driven by the supergranular\nconvection motion, the magnetic reconnection between the magnetic loop and the\nbackground open flux occurring in the transition region is simulated with a\ntwo-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics model. The simulation results show that\nnot only a fast hot jet, much resemble the found transition region jets, but\nalso a adjacent slow cool jet, mostly like classical spicules, is launched. The\nforce analysis shows that the fast hot jet is continually driven by the Lorentz\nforce around the reconnection region, while the slow cool jet is induced by an\ninitial kick through the Lorentz force associated with the emerging magnetic\nflux. Also, the features of the driven jets change with the amount of the\nemerging magnetic flux, giving the varieties of both jets. These results will\ninspire our understanding of the formation of the prevalence of both the fast\nhot jet and slow cool jet from the solar transition region and chromosphere.\n", "  Scale invariance emerges and plays an important role in strongly correlated\nmany-body systems such as critical regimes nearby phase transitions and the\nunitary Fermi gases. Discrete scaling symmetry also manifests itself in quantum\nfew-body systems such as the Efimov effect. Here we report both theoretical\npredication and experimental observation of a novel type expansion dynamics for\nscale invariant quantum gases. When the frequency of the harmonic trap holding\nthe gas decreases continuously as the inverse of time $t$, surprisingly, the\nexpansion of cloud size exhibits a sequence of plateaus. Remarkably, the\nlocations of these plateaus obey a discrete geometric scaling law with a\ncontrollable scale factor and the entire expansion dynamics is governed by a\nlog-periodic function. This striking expansion of quantum Fermi gases shares\nsimilar scaling laws and same mathematical description as the Efimov effect.\nOur work demonstrates the first expansion dynamics of a quantum many-body\nsystem with the temporal discrete scaling symmetry, which reveals the\nunderlying spatial continuous scaling symmetry of the many-body system.\n", "  We present predictions for the associated production of a Higgs boson at\nNLO+PS accuracy, including the effect of anomalous interactions between the\nHiggs and gauge bosons. We present our results in different frameworks, one in\nwhich the interaction vertex between the Higgs boson and Standard Model $W$ and\n$Z$ bosons is parameterized in terms of general Lorentz structures, and one in\nwhich Electroweak symmetry breaking is manifestly linear and the resulting\noperators arise through a six-dimensional effective field theory framework. We\npresent analytic calculations of the Standard Model and Beyond the Standard\nModel contributions, and discuss the phenomenological impact of the higher\norder pieces. Our results are implemented in the NLO Monte Carlo program MCFM,\nand interfaced to shower Monte Carlos through the {\\sc Powheg} box framework.\n", "  To fulfill the requirements for testing the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) of\nthe electromagnetic detec- tor at the Large High Altitude Air Shower\nObservatory (LHAASO), a multi-functional PMT test bench with a two dimensional\nscanning system has been developed. With this 2D scanning system, 16 PMTs can\nbe scanned simultaneously for characteristics tests, including uniformity,\ncathode transit time difference, single photo-electron spectrum, gain vs. high\nvoltage, linear behavior and dark noise. The programmable hardware and\nintelligent software of the test bench make it convenient to use and provide\nreliable results. The test methods are described in detail and primary results\nare presented.\n", "  The multi-band template analysis (MBTA) pipeline is a low-latency coincident\nanalysis pipeline for the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from compact\nbinary coalescences. MBTA runs with a low computational cost, and can identify\ncandidate GW events online with a sub-minute latency. The low computational\nrunning cost of MBTA also makes it useful for data quality studies. Events\ndetected by MBTA online can be used to alert astronomical partners for\nelectromagnetic follow-up. We outline the current status of MBTA and give\ndetails of recent pipeline upgrades and validation tests that were performed in\npreparation for the first advanced detector observing period. The MBTA pipeline\nis ready for the outset of the advanced detector era and the exciting prospects\nit will bring.\n", "  We obtain the planar correlation function of four half-BPS operators of\narbitrary weights, up to three loops. Our method exploits only elementary\nproperties of the integrand of the planar correlator, such as its symmetries\nand singularity structure. This allows us to write down a general ansatz for\nthe integrand. The coefficients in the ansatz are fixed by means of a powerful\nlight-cone OPE relation between correlators with different weights. Our result\nis formulated in terms of a limited number of functions built from known one-,\ntwo- and three-loop conformal integrals. These results are useful for checking\nrecent integrability predictions for the OPE structure constants.\n", "  Spatial stochastic molecular simulations in biology are limited by the\nintense computation required to track molecules in space either in a discrete\ntime or discrete space framework, meaning that the serial limit has already\nbeen reached in sub-cellular models. This calls for parallel simulations that\ncan take advantage of the power of modern supercomputers; however exact methods\nare known to be inherently serial. We introduce an operator splitting\nimplementation for irregular grids with a novel method to improve accuracy, and\ndemonstrate potential for scalable parallel simulations in an initial MPI\nversion. We foresee that this groundwork will enable larger scale, whole-cell\nstochastic simulations in the near future.\n", "  In this work, a constant and uniform magnetic field is less than the\nSchwinger critical value. In turn, an additional constant and uniform electric\nfield is taken much smaller than the magnetic field value. The propagation of a\nphoton in this electromagnetic field is investigating. In particular, in the\npresence of a weak electric field, the root divergence is absent in the photon\neffective mass near the thresholds of pair creation. The effective mass of a\nreal photon with a preset polarization is considered in the quantum energy\nregion as well as in the quasiclassical one.\n", "  Quantum chemistry calculations provide the potential energy between two\ncarbon atoms in ethane (H$_3$C$-$CH$_3$), ethene (H$_2$C$=$CH$_2$), and ethyne\n(HC$\\equiv$CH) as a function of the atomic distance. Based on the energy\nfunction for the $\\sigma$-bond in ethane, $V_{\\sigma}(r)$, we use the H\\\"uckel\nmodel with Hubbard--Ohno interaction for the $\\pi$~electrons to describe the\nenergies $V_{\\sigma\\pi}(r)$ and $V_{\\sigma\\pi\\pi}(r)$ for the $\\sigma\\pi$\ndouble bond in ethene and the $\\sigma\\pi\\pi$ triple bond in ethyne,\nrespectively. The fit of the force functions shows that the Peierls coupling\ncan be estimated with some precision whereas the Hubbard-Ohno parameters are\ninsignificant at the distances under consideration. We apply the\nH\\\"uckel-Hubbard-Ohno model to describe the bond lengths and the energies of\nelementary electronic excitations of trans-polyacetylene, (CH)$_n$, and adjust\nthe $\\sigma$-bond potential for conjugated polymers.\n", "  Plasma rotation in connection to both zonal and mean (equilibrium) flows can\nplay a role in the transitions to the advanced confinement regimes in tokamaks,\nas the L-H transition and the formation of Internal Transport Barriers. For\nincompressible rotation the equilibrium is governed by a generalized\nGrad-Shafranov (GGS) equation and a decoupled Bernoulli-type equation for the\npressure. For parallel flow the GGS equation can be transformed to one\nidentical in form with the usual GS equation. In the present study on the basis\nof the latter equation we have extended HELENA, an equilibrium fixed boundary\nsolver.\n  The extended code solves the GGS equation for a variety of the two\nfree-surface-function terms involved for arbitrary Alfv\\'en Mach and density\nfunctions. We have constructed diverted-boundary equilibria pertinent to ITER\nand examined their characteristics, in particular as concerns the impact of\nrotation on certain equilibrium quantities. It turns out that the rotation and\nits shear affect noticeably the pressure and toroidal current density with the\nimpact on the current density being stronger in the parallel direction than in\nthe toroidal one. Also, the linear stability of the equilibria constructed is\nexamined by applying a sufficient condition.\n", "  We propose a novel method for testing isotropy of a three-dimensional\ndistribution using Shannon entropy. We test the method on some Monte Carlo\nsimulations of isotropic and anisotropic distributions and find that the method\ncan effectively identify and characterize different types of hemispherical\nasymmetry inputted in a distribution. We generate anisotropic distributions by\nintroducing pockets of different densities inside homogeneous and isotropic\ndistributions and find that the proposed method can effectively quantify the\ndegree of anisotropy and determine the geometry of the pockets introduced. We\nalso considered spherically symmetric radially inhomogeneous distributions\nwhich are anisotropic at all points other than the centre and find that such\nanisotropy can be easily characterized by our method. We use a semi analytic\ngalaxy catalogue from the Millennium simulation to study the anisotropies\ninduced by the redshift space distortions and find that the method can separate\nsuch anisotropies from a general one. The method may be also suitably adapted\nfor any two dimensional maps on the celestial sphere to study the hemispherical\nasymmetry in other cosmological observations.\n", "  We present a hybrid optomechanical scheme to achieve dynamical squeezing of\nposition quadrature of a mesoscopic mechanical oscillator, that can be\nexternally controlled by classical fields. A membrane-in-the-middle set up is\nemployed, in which an atom in $\\Lambda$ configuration is considered to be\ntrapped on either side of the membrane inside the cavity. We show that a\nconsiderable amount of squeezing (beyond the 3 dB limit) can be achieved that\nis not affected by the decay of the cavity and the spontaneous emission of the\natom. Squeezing depends upon the initial preparation of atomic states. Further,\na strong effective coupling between the atom and the oscillator can be attained\nby using large control fields that pump the atom and the cavity. Effect of\nthermal phononic bath on squeezing is studied in terms of the squeezing\nspectrum. The results are supported by the detailed analytical calculations.\n", "  We study the dynamo instability driven by a turbulent two dimensional flow\nwith three components of the form (u(x, y, t), v(x, y, t), w(x, y, t))\nsometimes referred to as a 2.5 dimensional flow. This type of flows provides an\napproximation to very fast rotating flows often observed in nature. The low\ndimensionality of the system allows the investigation of a wide range of fluid\nReynolds number Re, magnetic Reynolds number Rm and forcing length scales\nrelative to the domain size that is still prohibited for full three dimensional\nnumerical simulations. We were thus able to determine the properties of the\ndynamo onset as a function of Re and and the asymptotic behavior of the most\nunstable mode in the large Rm limit. In particular it has been shown that: In a\nnon-helical flow in an infinite domain the critical magnetic Reynolds number\nRmc becomes a constant in the large Re limit. A helical flow always results in\ndynamo in agreement with mean field predictions. For thin layers for both\nhelical and nonhelical flows the Rmc scales as a power-law of Re. The\ngrowth-rate of fastest growing mode becomes independent of Re and Rm when their\nvalues are sufficiently large. The most unstable length scale in this limit\nscales linearly with the forcing length scale. Thus while the mean field\npredictions are valid, they are not expected to be dominant in the large Rm\nlimit.\n", "  The study of light-matter interaction at the quantum scale has been enabled\nby the cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) architecture, in which a quantum\ntwo-level system strongly couples to a single cavity mode. Originally\nimplemented with atoms in optical cavities, CQED effects are now also observed\nwith artificial atoms in solid-state environments. Such realizations of these\nsystems exhibit fast dynamics, which makes them attractive candidates for\ndevices including modulators and sources in high-throughput communications.\nHowever, these systems possess large photon out-coupling rates that obscure any\nquantum behavior at large excitation powers. Here, we have utilised a\nself-homodyning interferometric technique that fully employs the complex mode\nstructure of our nanofabricated cavity to observe a quantum phenomenon known as\nthe dynamic Mollow triplet. We expect this interference to facilitate the\ndevelopment of arbitrary on-chip quantum state generators, thereby strongly\ninfluencing quantum lithography, metrology, and imaging.\n", "  Detailed study of thermalization of the momentum spectra of partons produced\nvia decays of the color flux tubes due to the Schwinger tunneling mechanism is\npresented. The collisions between particles are included in the relaxation time\napproximation specified by different values of the shear viscosity to entropy\ndensity ratio. At first we show that, to a good approximation, the\ntransverse-momentum spectra of the produced patrons are exponential,\nirrespectively from the assumed value of the viscosity of the system and the\nfreeze-out time. This thermal-like behaviour may be attributed to specific\nproperties of the Schwinger tunneling process. In the next step, in order to\ncheck the approach of the system towards genuine local equilibrium, we compare\nthe local slope of the model transverse-momentum spectra with the local slope\nof the fully equilibrated reference spectra characterised by the effective\ntemperature that reproduces the energy density of the system. We find that the\nviscosity corresponding to the AdS/CFT lower bound is necessary for\nthermalization of the system within about two fermis.\n", "  Topologically protected swirl of the magnetic texture known as the Skyrmion\nhas become ubiqui- tous in both metallic and insulating chiral magnets.\nMeanwhile the existence of its three-dimensional analogue, known as the\nmagnetic monopole, has been suggested by various indirect experimental sig-\nnatures in MnGe compound. Theoretically, Ginzburg-Landau arguments in favor of\nthe formation of a three-dimensional crystal of monopoles and anti-monopoles\nhave been put forward, however no microscopic model Hamiltonian was shown to\nsupport such a phase. Here we present strong numerical evidence from Monte\nCarlo simulations for the formation of a rock-salt crystal structure of\nmonopoles and anti-monopoles in short-period chiral magnets. Real-time\nsimulation of the spin dynamics suggests there is only one collective mode in\nthe monopole crystal state in the frequency range of several GHz for the\nmaterial parameters of MnGe.\n", "  Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) investigations of modulated\nstates in a FeGe wedge and detailed calculations demonstrate that chiral twists\narising near the surfaces of noncentrosymmetric ferromagnets (Meynell et al.\nPhys. Rev. B, 90, 014406 (2014)) provide a stabilization mechanism for skyrmion\nlattices and helicoids in cubic helimagnet nanolayers. The calculated magnetic\nphase diagram for free standing cubic helimagnet nanolayers shows that\nmagnetization processes in these compounds fundamentally differ from those in\nbulk cubic helimagnets and are characterized by the first-order transitions\nbetween modulated phases and the formation of specific multidomain states. The\npaper reports LTEM observations of multidomain patterns in FeGe free-standing\nnanolayers.\n", "  Carrier dynamics in monolayer MoS2 have been investigated using broadband\nfemtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (FTAS). A tunable pump pulse was\nused while a broadband probe pulse revealed ground and excited state carrier\ndynamics. Interestingly, for pump wavelengths both resonant and non-resonant\nwith the A and B excitons, we observe a broad ground state bleach around 2.9\neV, with decay components similar to A and B. Associating this bleach with the\nband nesting region between K and Gamma in the band structure indicates\nsignificant k-space delocalization and overlap among excitonic wave functions\nidentified as A, B, C, and D. Comparison of time dynamics for all features in\nresonance and non-resonance excitation is consistent with this finding.\n", "  We examine in greater detail the recent proposal of using superconductors for\ndetecting dark matter as light as the warm dark matter limit of O(keV).\nDetection of such light dark matter is possible if the entire kinetic energy of\nthe dark matter is extracted in the scattering, and if the experiment is\nsensitive to O(meV) energy depositions. This is the case for Fermi-degenerate\nmaterials in which the Fermi velocity exceeds the dark matter velocity\ndispersion in the Milky Way of ~10^-3. We focus on a concrete experimental\nproposal using a superconducting target with a transition edge sensor in order\nto detect the small energy deposits from the dark matter scatterings.\nConsidering a wide variety of constraints, from dark matter self-interactions\nto the cosmic microwave background, we show that models consistent with\ncosmological/astrophysical and terrestrial constraints are observable with such\ndetectors. A wider range of viable models with dark matter mass below an MeV is\navailable if dark matter or mediator properties (such as couplings or masses)\ndiffer at BBN epoch or in stellar interiors from those in superconductors. We\nalso show that metal targets pay a strong in-medium suppression for kinetically\nmixed mediators; this suppression is alleviated with insulating targets.\n", "  Theoretical models of galaxy formation based on the cold dark matter\ncosmogony typically require strong feedback from supernova (SN) explosions in\norder to reproduce the Milky Way satellite galaxy luminosity function and the\nfaint end of the field galaxy luminosity function. However, too strong a SN\nfeedback also leads to the universe reionizing too late, and the metallicities\nof Milky Way satellites being too low. The combination of these four\nobservations therefore places tight constraints on SN feedback. We investigate\nthese constraints using the semi-analytical galaxy formation model galform. We\nfind that these observations favour a SN feedback model in which the feedback\nstrength evolves with redshift. We find that, for our best fit model, half of\nthe ionizing photons are emitted by galaxies with rest-frame far-UV absolute\nmagnitudes $M_{\\rm AB}(1500{\\rm \\AA})<-17.5$, which implies that already\nobserved galaxy populations contribute about half of the photons responsible\nfor reionization. The $z=0$ descendants of these galaxies are mainly galaxies\nwith stellar mass $M_*>10^{10}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ and preferentially inhabit\nhalos with mass $M_{\\rm halo}>10^{13}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$.\n", "  We present a platform based upon silicon nitride nanomembranes for\nintegrating superconducting microwave circuits with planar acoustic and optical\ndevices such as phononic and photonic crystals. Utilizing tensile stress and\nlithographic patterning of a silicon nitride nanomembrane we are able to\nreliably realize planar capacitors with vacuum gap sizes down to $s \\approx\n80$nm. In combination with spiral inductor coils of micron pitch, this yields\nmicrowave ($\\approx 8$GHz) resonant circuits of high impedance ($Z_{0} \\approx\n3.4$k$\\Omega$) suitable for efficient electromechanical coupling to nanoscale\nacoustic structures. We measure an electromechanical vacuum coupling rate of\n$g_{0}/2\\pi = 41.5$~Hz to the low frequency ($4.48$MHz) global beam motion of a\npatterned phononic crystal nanobeam, and through parametric microwave driving\nreach a backaction cooled mechanical mode occupancy as low as $n_{m} = 0.58$.\n", "  It is shown that the vector-vortex Laguerre-Gauss modes with\npolarization-orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement are the vector\nsolutions of the Maxwell equations in a graded-index medium. Focusing of\nlinearly and circularly polarized vortex light beams with nonzero azimuthal and\nradial indices in a cylindrical graded-index medium is investigated. The wave\nshape variation with distance taking into account the spin-orbit and\nnonparaxial effects is analyzed. Effect of long-term periodical revival of wave\npackets due to mode interference in a graded-index cylindrical optical\nwaveguide is demonstrated. High efficiency transfer of a strongly focused spot\nthrough an optical waveguide over large distances takes place with a period of\nrevival.\n", "  Fundamental Lagrangian, frozen-in and topological invariants can be useful to\nexplain systematic connections between plasma parameters. At high plasma\ntemperature the dissipation is small and the robust invariances are manifested.\nWe invoke a frozen-in invariant which is an extension of the Ertel's theorem\nand connects the vorticity of the large scale motions with the profile of the\nsafety factor and of particle density. Assuming ergodicity of the small scale\nturbulence we consider the approximative preservation of the invariant for\nchanges of the vorticity in an annular region of finite radial extension (i.e.\npoloidal rotation). We find that the ionization-induced rotation triggered by a\npellet requires a reversed-$q$ profile in an off-axis region of the core. In\nthe $H$-mode, the invariance requires the accumulation of the current density\nin the rotation layer at the edge. Then this becomes a vorticity-current sheet\nwhich may explain experimental observations related to the penetration of the\nResonant Magnetic Perturbation and the filamentation during the Edge Localized\nModes.\n", "  In instantaneous nonlocal quantum computation, two parties cooperate in order\nto perform a quantum computation on their joint inputs, while being restricted\nto a single round of simultaneous communication. Previous results showed that\ninstantaneous nonlocal quantum computation is possible, at the cost of an\nexponential amount of prior shared entanglement (in the size of the input).\nHere, we show that a linear amount of entanglement suffices, (in the size of\nthe computation), as long as the parties share nonlocal correlations as given\nby the Popescu-Rohlich box. This means that communication is not required for\nefficient instantaneous nonlocal quantum computation. Exploiting the well-known\nrelation to position-based cryptography, our result also implies the\nimpossibility of secure position-based cryptography against adversaries with\nnon-signalling correlations. Furthermore, our construction establishes a\nquantum analogue of the classical communication complexity collapse under\nnon-signalling correlations.\n", "  Assessing the significance of alignment scores of optimally aligned DNA or\namino acid sequences can be achieved via the knowledge of the score\ndistribution of random sequences. But this requires obtaining the distribution\nin the biologically relevant high-scoring region, where the probabilities are\nexponentially small. For gapless local alignments of infinitely long sequences\nthis distribution is known analytically to follow a Gumbel distribution.\nDistributions for gapped local alignments and global alignments of finite\nlengths can only be obtained numerically. To obtain result for the\nsmall-probability region, specific statistical mechanics-based rare-event\nalgorithms can be applied. In previous studies, this was achieved for pairwise\nalignments. They showed that, contrary to results from previous simple sampling\nstudies, strong deviations from the Gumbel distribution occur in case of finite\nsequence lengths. Here we extend the studies to the for practical applications\nin Molecular Biology much more relevant case of multiple sequence alignments\nwith gaps. We study the distributions of scores over a large range of the\nsupport, reaching probabilities as small as 10^-160, for global and local\n(sum-of-pair scores) multiple alignments. We find that even after suitable\nrescaling, eliminating the sequence-length dependence, the distributions for\nmultiple alignment differ from the pairwise alignment case. Furthermore, we\nalso show that the previously discussed Gaussian correction to the Gumbel\ndistribution needs to be refined, also for the case of pairwise alignments.\n", "  We show how one-loop corrections to scattering amplitudes of scalars and\ngauge bosons can be obtained from tree amplitudes in one higher dimension.\nStarting with a complete tree-level scattering amplitude of n+2 particles in\nfive dimensions, one assumes that two of them cannot be \"detected\" and\ntherefore an integration over their LIPS is carried out. The resulting object,\nfunction of the remaining n particles, is taken to be four-dimensional by\nrestricting the corresponding momenta. We perform this procedure in the context\nof the tree-level CHY formulation of amplitudes. The scattering equations\nobtained in the procedure coincide with those derived by Geyer et al from\nambitwistor constructions and recently studied by two of the authors for\nbi-adjoint scalars. They have two sectors of solutions: regular and singular.\nWe prove that the contribution from regular solutions generically gives rise to\nunphysical poles. However, using a BCFW argument we prove that the unphysical\ncontributions are always homogeneous functions of the loop momentum and can be\ndiscarded. We also show that the contribution from singular solutions turns out\nto be homogeneous as well.\n", "  Bulk fluctuations of conserved charges measured by event-by-event analysis in\nrelativistic heavy ion collisions are observables which are believed to carry\nsignificant amount of information on the hot medium created by the collisions.\nActive studies have been done recently experimentally, theoretically, and on\nthe lattice. In particular, non-Gaussianity of the fluctuations has acquired\nmuch attention recently. In this review, we give a pedagogical introduction to\nthese issues, and survey recent developments in this field of research.\nStarting from the definition of cumulants, basic concepts in fluctuation\nphysics, such as thermal fluctuations in statistical mechanics and time\nevolution of fluctuations in diffusive systems, are described. Phenomena which\nare expected to occur in finite temperature and/or density QCD matter and their\nmeasurement by event-by-event analyses are also elucidated.\n", "  We deploy linear stability analysis to find the threshold wavelength\n($\\lambda$) and surface tension ($\\gamma$) of Rayleigh-Plateau type\n\"peristaltic\" instabilities in incompressible neo-Hookean solids in a range of\ncylindrical geometries with radius $R_0$. First we consider a solid cylinder,\nand recover the well-known, infinite wavelength instability for $\\gamma\\ge6 \\mu\nR_0$, where $\\mu$ is the solid's shear modulus. Second, we consider a\nvolume-conserving (e.g.\\ fluid filled and sealed) cylindrical cavity through an\ninfinite solid, and demonstrate infinite wavelength instability for $\\gamma\\ge\n2 \\mu R_0$. Third, we consider a solid cylinder embedded in a different\ninfinite solid, and find a finite wavelength instability with $\\lambda\\propto\nR_0$, at surface tension $\\gamma \\propto \\mu R_0$, where the constants depend\non the two solids' modulus ratio. Finally, we consider an empty cylindrical\nchannel (or filled with expellable fluid) through an infinite solid, and find\nan instability with finite wavelength, $\\lambda \\approx2 R_0$, for $\\gamma\\ge\n2.543... \\mu R_0$. Using finite-strain numerics, we show such a channel jumps\nat instability to a highly peristaltic state, likely precipitating it's\nblockage or failure. We argue that finite wavelengths are generic for\nelasto-capillary instabilities, with the simple cylinder's infinite wavelength\nbeing the exception rather than the rule.\n", "  We theoretically characterize the semiclassical dynamics of an ensemble of\natoms after a sudden quench across a driven-dissipative second-order phase\ntransition. The atoms are driven by a laser and interact via conservative and\ndissipative long-range forces mediated by the photons of a single-mode cavity.\nThese forces can cool the motion and, above a threshold value of the laser\nintensity, induce spatial ordering. We show that the relaxation dynamics\nfollowing the quench exhibits a long prethermalizing behaviour which is first\ndominated by coherent long-range forces, and then by their interplay with\ndissipation. Remarkably, dissipation-assisted prethermalization is orders of\nmagnitude longer than prethermalization due to the coherent dynamics. We show\nthat it is associated with the creation of momentum-position correlations,\nwhich remain nonzero for even longer times than mean-field predicts. This\nimplies that cavity cooling of an atomic ensemble into the selforganized phase\ncan require longer time scales than the typical experimental duration. In\ngeneral, these results demonstrate that noise and dissipation can substantially\nslow down the onset of thermalization in long-range interacting many-body\nsystems.\n", "  In high energy collisions of heavy-ions, experimental findings of collective\nflow are customarily associated with the presence of a thermalized medium\nexpanding according to the laws of hydrodynamics. Recently, the ATLAS, CMS and\nALICE experiments found signals of the same type and magnitude in\nultrarelativistic proton-proton collisions. In this study, the state-of-the-art\nhydrodynamic model SONIC is used to simulate the systems created in p+p\ncollisions. By varying the size of the second-order transport coefficients, the\nrange of applicability of hydrodynamics itself to the systems created in p+p\ncollisions is quantified. It is found that hydrodynamics can give\nquantitatively reliable results for the particle spectra and the elliptic\nmomentum anisotropy coefficient $v_2$. Using a simple geometric model of the\nproton based on the elastic form factor leads to results of similar type and\nmagnitude to those found in experiment when allowing for a small bulk viscosity\ncoefficient.\n", "  We identify subsystem fluctuations (variances) that measure entanglement in\nan arbitrary bipartite pure state. These fluctuations are of observables that\ngeneralize the notion of polarization to an arbitrary N-level subsystem. We\nexpress this polarization fluctuation in terms of subsystem purity and other\nentanglement measures. The derived fluctuation-entanglement relation is\nevaluated for the ground states of a one-dimensional free fermion gas and the\nAffleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chain. Our results provide a framework for\nexperimentally measuring entanglement using Stern-Gerlach-type state selectors.\n", "  We present a phenomenological study of nuclear effects in neutrino\ncharged-current interactions, using transverse kinematic imbalances in\nexclusive measurements. Novel observables with minimal dependence on neutrino\nenergy are proposed to study quasielastic scattering, and especially resonance\nproduction. They should be able to provide direct constraints on nuclear\neffects in neutrino- and antineutrino-nucleus interactions.\n", "  We analyse the interaction of charged Janus particles including screening\neffects. The explicit interaction is mapped via a least square method on a\nvariable number $n$ of systematically generated tensors that reflect the\nangular dependence of the potential. For $n = 2$ we show that the interaction\nis equivalent to a model previously described by Erdmann, Kr\\\"oger and Hess\n(EKH). Interestingly, this mapping is not able to capture the subtleties of the\ninteraction for small screening lengths. Rather, a larger number of tensors has\nto be used. We find that the characteristics of the Janus type interaction\nplays an important role for the aggregation behaviour. We obtained cluster\nstructures up to the size of $13$ particles for $n = 2$ and $36$ and screening\nlengths $\\kappa^{-1} = 0.1$ and $1.0$ via Monte Carlo simulations. The\ninfluence of the screening length is analysed and the structures are compared\nto results for an electrostatic-type potential and for multipole-expanded\nDerjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory. We find that a dipole-like\npotential (EKH or dipole DLVO approximation) is not able to sufficiently\nreproduce the anisotropy effects of the potential. Instead, a higher order\nexpansion has to be used to obtain clusters structures that are identical to\nexperimental results for up to $N = 8$ particles. The resulting minimum-energy\nclusters are compared to those of sticky hard sphere systems. Janus particles\nwith a short-range screened interaction resemble sticky hard sphere clusters\nfor all considered particle numbers, whereas for long-range screening even very\nsmall clusters are structurally different.\n", "  We introduce a novel harmonic superspace for $3d$ $\\mathcal{N}=6$\nsuperconformal field theories that is tailor made for the study of correlation\nfunctions of BPS operators. We calculate a host of two- and three-point\nfunctions in full generality and put strong constraints on the form of\nfour-point functions of some selected BPS multiplets. For the four-point\nfunction of $\\frac{1}{2}$-BPS operators we obtain the associated Ward\nidentities by imposing the absence of harmonic singularities. The latter imply\nthe existence of a solvable subsector in which the correlator becomes\ntopological. This mechanism can be explained by cohomological reduction with\nrespect to a special nilpotent supercharge.\n", "  Lubrication flows appear in many applications in engineering, biophysics, and\nin nature. Separation of surfaces and minimisation of friction and wear is\nachieved when the lubrication fluid builds up a lift force. In this paper we\nanalyse soft lubricated contacts by treating the solid walls as viscoelastic:\nsoft materials are typically not purely elastic, but dissipate energy under\ndynamical loading conditions. We present a method for viscoelastic lubrication\nand focus on three canonical examples, namely Kelvin-Voigt-, Standard Linear-,\nand Power Law-rheology. It is shown how the solid viscoelasticity affects the\nlubrication process when the timescale of loading becomes comparable to the\nrheological timescale. We derive asymptotic relations between lift force and\nsliding velocity, which give scaling laws that inherit a signature of the\nrheology. In all cases the lift is found to decrease with respect to purely\nelastic systems.\n", "  Photonic integrated circuits that exploit nonlinear optics in order to\ngenerate and process signals all-optically have achieved performance far\nsuperior to that possible electronically - particularly with respect to speed.\nWe review the recent achievements based in new CMOS-compatible platforms that\nare better suited than SOI for nonlinear optics, focusing on radio frequency\n(RF) and microwave based applications that exploit micro-resonator based\nfrequency combs. We highlight their potential as well as the challenges to\nachieving practical solutions for many key applications. These material systems\nhave opened up many new capabilities such as on-chip optical frequency comb\ngeneration and ultrafast optical pulse generation and measurement. We review\nrecent work on a photonic RF Hilbert transformer for broadband microwave\nin-phase and quadrature-phase generation based on an integrated frequency\noptical comb. The comb is generated using a nonlinear microring resonator based\non a CMOS compatible, high-index contrast, doped-silica glass platform. The\nhigh quality and large frequency spacing of the comb enables filters with up to\n20 taps, allowing us to demonstrate a quadrature filter with more than a\n5-octave (3 dB) bandwidth and an almost uniform phase response.\n", "  Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) can feature predictions for the ratios of quark\nand lepton Yukawa couplings at high energy, which can be tested with the\nincreasingly precise results for the fermion masses, given at low energies. To\nperform such tests, the renormalization group (RG) running has to be performed\nwith sufficient accuracy. In supersymmetric (SUSY) theories, the one-loop\nthreshold corrections (TC) are of particular importance and, since they affect\nthe quark-lepton mass relations, link a given GUT flavour model to the\nsparticle spectrum. To accurately study such predictions, we extend and\ngeneralize various formulas in the literature which are needed for a precision\nanalysis of SUSY flavour GUT models. We introduce the new software tool SusyTC,\na major extension to the Mathematica package REAP, where these formulas are\nimplemented. SusyTC extends the functionality of REAP by a full inclusion of\nthe (complex) MSSM SUSY sector and a careful calculation of the one-loop SUSY\nthreshold corrections for the full down-type quark, up-type quark and charged\nlepton Yukawa coupling matrices in the electroweak-unbroken phase. Among other\nuseful features, SusyTC calculates the one-loop corrected pole mass of the\ncharged (or the CP-odd) Higgs boson as well as provides output in SLHA\nconventions, i.e. the necessary input for external software, e.g. for\nperforming a two-loop Higgs mass calculation. We apply SusyTC to study the\npredictions for the parameters of the CMSSM (mSUGRA) SUSY scenario from the set\nof GUT scale Yukawa relations $y_e / y_d = - 1/2$, $y_\\mu / y_s = 6$, and\n$y_\\tau / y_b = - 3/2$, which has been proposed recently in the context of SUSY\nGUT flavour models.\n", "  We study a model of scalars which includes both the SM Higgs and a scalar\nsinglet as composites of heavy vector-like fermions. The vector-like fermions\nare bounded by the super-strong four-fermion interactions. The scalar singlet\ndecays to SM vector bosons through loop of heavy vector-like fermions. We show\nthat the surprisingly large production cross section of di-photon events at 750\nGeV resonance and the odd decay properties can all be explained. This model\nserves as a good model for both SM Higgs and a scalar resonance at 750 GeV.\n", "  We study the dynamics of a vortex in a quasi two-dimensional Bose gas\nconsisting of light matter coupled atoms forming two-component pseudo spins.\nThe gas is subject to a density dependent gauge potential, hence governed by an\ninteracting gauge theory, which stems from a collisionally induced detuning\nbetween the incident laser frequency and the atomic energy levels. This\nprovides a back-action between the synthetic gauge potential and the matter\nfield. A Lagrangian approach is used to derive an expression for the force\nacting on a vortex in such a gas. We discuss the similarities between this\nforce and the one predicted by Iordanskii, Lifshitz and Pitaevskii when\nscattering between a superfluid vortex and the thermal component is taken into\naccount.\n", "  Low energy inelastic neutron scattering on single crystals of the kagome spin\nliquid compound ZnCu3(OD)6Cl2 (Herbertsmithite) reveals antiferromagnetic\ncorrelations between impurity spins for energy transfers E < 0.8 meV (~J/20).\nThe momentum dependence differs significantly from higher energy scattering\nwhich arises from the intrinsic kagome spins. The low energy fluctuations are\ncharacterized by diffuse scattering near wavevectors (1 0 0) and (0 0 3/2),\nwhich is consistent with antiferromagnetic correlations between pairs of\nnearest neighbor Cu impurities on adjacent triangular (Zn) interlayers. The\ncorresponding impurity lattice resembles a simple cubic lattice in the dilute\nlimit below the percolation threshold. Such an impurity model can describe\nprior neutron, NMR, and specific heat data. The low energy neutron data are\nconsistent with the presence of a small spin-gap (Delta ~ 0.7 meV) in the\nkagome layers, similar to that recently observed by NMR. The ability to\ndistinguish the scattering due to Cu impurities from that of the planar kagome\nCu spins provides a new avenue for probing intrinsic spin liquid physics.\n", "  The target space of a nonlinear sigma model is usually required to be\npositive definite to avoid ghosts. We introduce a unique class of nonlinear\nsigma models where the target space metric has a Lorentzian signature, thus the\nassociated group being non-compact. We show that the would-be ghost associated\nwith the negative direction is fully projected out by 2 second-class\nconstraints, and there exist stable solutions in this class of models. This\nresult also has important implications for Lorentz--invariant massive gravity:\nThere exist stable nontrivial vacua in massive gravity that are free from any\nlinear vDVZ--discontinuity and a $\\Lambda_2$ decoupling limit can be defined on\nthese vacua.\n", "  We consider continuous one-dimensional multifrequency Schr\\\"odinger\noperators, with analytic potential, and prove Anderson localization in the\nregime of positive Lyapunov exponent for almost all phases and almost all\nDiophantine frequencies.\n", "  Circular Electron-Positron Collider(CEPC) is one of the largest plans in high\nenergy physics study at China, which would serve as Higgs Factory firstly and\nthen upgrade to a hadron collider. In this paper we give the 50km and 100km\ndesign in both single ring and double ring schemes, including $Z$ boson and $W$\nboson and Higgs boson by using the optimized method. Also, we give the\npotential of CEPC running at $Z$ and $W$ poles. And we analysis the\nrelationship of luminosity with circumference and filling factor, which gives a\nway to evaluate the choice of geometry. What's more, we compare the nominal\nperformance of CEPC-SPPC and LHC and FCC.\n", "  In the present work, we employ exact diagonalization for model systems on a\nreal-space lattice to explicitly construct the exact density-to-potential and\nfor the first time the exact density-to-wavefunction map that underly the\nHohenberg-Kohn theorem in density functional theory. Having the explicit\nwavefunction-to- density map at hand, we are able to construct arbitrary\nobservables as functionals of the ground-state density. We analyze the\ndensity-to-potential map as the distance between the fragments of a system\nincreases and the correlation in the system grows. We observe a feature that\ngradually develops in the density-to-potential map as well as in the\ndensity-to-wavefunction map. This feature is inherited by arbitrary expectation\nvalues as functional of the ground-state density. We explicitly show the\nexcited-state energies, the excited-state densities, and the correlation\nentropy as functionals of the ground-state density. All of them show this exact\nfeature that sharpens as the coupling of the fragments decreases and the\ncorrelation grows. We denominate this feature as intra-system steepening. We\nshow that for fully decoupled subsystems the intra-system steepening transforms\ninto the well-known inter-system derivative discontinuity. An important\nconclusion is that for e.g. charge transfer processes between localized\nfragments within the same system it is not the usual inter-system derivative\ndiscontinuity that is missing in common ground-state functionals, but rather\nthe differentiable intra-system steepening that we illustrate in the present\nwork.\n", "  We review several experimental and theoretical advances that emphasise common\naspects of the study of T=1 and T=0 pairing correlations in nuclei. We first\ndiscuss several empirical evidences of the special role played by the T=1\npairing interaction. In particular, we show the peculiar features of the\nnuclear pairing interaction in the low density regime, and possible outcomes\nsuch as the BCS-BEC crossover in nuclear matter and, in an analogous way, in\nloosely bound nuclei. We then move to the competition between T=1 and T=0\npairing correlations. The effect of such competition on the low-lying spectra\nis studied in N=Z odd-odd nuclei by using a three-body model; it is shown that\nthe inversion of the 0+ and 1+ states near the ground state, and the strong\nmagnetic dipole transitions between them, can be considered as a clear\nmanifestation of strong T=0 pairing correlations in these nuclei. The effect of\nT=0 pairing correlations is also quite evident if one studies charge-changing\ntransitions. The Gamow-Teller (GT) states in N=Z+2 nuclei are studied here by\nusing self-consistent HFB+QRPA calculations in which the T=0 pairing\ninteraction is taken into account. Strong GT states are found, near the ground\nstate of daughter nuclei; these are compared with available experimental data\nfrom charge-exchange reactions, and such comparison can pinpoint the value of\nthe strength of the T=0 interaction. Pair transfer reactions are eventually\ndiscussed: while two-neutron transfer has been long proposed as a tool to\nmeasure the T=1 superfluidity in the nuclear ground states, the study of\ndeuteron transfer is still in its infancy, despite its potential interest in\nrevealing effects coming from both T=1 and T=0 interactions.\n", "  We consider the simplest possible setting of non abelian twist fields which\ncorresponds to $SU(2)$ monodromies. We first review the theory of\nhypergeometric function and of the solutions of the most general Fuchsian\nsecond order equation with three singularities. Then we solve the problem of\nwriting the general solution with prescribed $U(2)$ monodromies. We use this\nresult to compute the classical string solution corresponding to three $D2$\nbranes in $R^4$. Despite the fact the configuration is supersymmetric the\nclassical string solution is not holomorphic. Using the equation of motion and\nnot the KLT approach we give a very simple expression for the classical action\nof the string. We find that the classical action is not proportional to the\narea of the triangle determined by the branes intersection points since the\nsolution is not holomorphic. Phenomenologically this means that the Yukawa\ncouplings for these supersymmetric configurations on non factorized tori are\nsuppressed with respect to the factorized case.\n", "  This paper examines how increasing the value of the Reynolds number $Re$\naffects the ability of spanwise-forcing techniques to yield turbulent\nskin-friction drag reduction. The considered forcing is based on the\nstreamwise-travelling waves of spanwise wall velocity (Quadrio {\\em et al. J.\nFluid Mech.}, vol. 627, 2009, pp. 161--178). The study builds upon an extensive\ndrag-reduction database created with Direct Numerical Simulation of a turbulent\nchannel flow for two, 5-fold separated values of $Re$, namely $Re_\\tau=200$ and\n$Re_\\tau=1000$. The sheer size of the database, which for the first time\nsystematically addresses the amplitude of the forcing, allows a comprehensive\nview of the drag-reducing characteristics of the travelling waves, and enables\na detailed description of the changes occurring when $Re$ increases. The effect\nof using a viscous scaling based on the friction velocity of either the\nnon-controlled flow or the drag-reduced flow is described. In analogy with\nother wall-based drag reduction techniques, like for example riblets, the\nperformance of the travelling waves is well described by a vertical shift of\nthe logarithmic portion of the mean streamwise velocity profile. Except when\n$Re$ is very low, this shift remains constant with $Re$, at odds with the\npercentage reduction of the friction coefficient, which is known to present a\nmild, logarithmic decline. Our new data agree with the available literature,\nwhich is however mostly based on low-$Re$ information and hence predicts a\nquick drop of maximum drag reduction with $Re$. The present study supports a\nmore optimistic scenario, where for an airplane at flight Reynolds numbers a\ndrag reduction of nearly 30\\% would still be possible thanks to the travelling\nwaves.\n", "  In this work, by using the strong coupling expansion and exact diagonization\n(ED), we study the $ Z_2/U(1) $ Dicke model with independent rotating wave (RW)\ncoupling $ g $ and counter-rotating wave (CRW) coupling $ g^{\\prime} $ at a\nfinite $ N $.\n  This model includes the four standard quantum optics model: Rabi, Dicke,\nJaynes-Cummings ( JC ) and Tavis-Cummings (TC) model as its various special\nlimits. We show that in the super-radiant phase, the system's energy levels are\ngrouped into doublets with even and odd parity.\n  Any anisotropy $ \\beta=g/g^{\\prime} \\neq 1 $ leads to the oscillation of\nparities in both the ground and excited doublets as the atom-photon coupling\nstrength increases.\n  The oscillations will be pushed to the infinite coupling strength in the\nisotropic $ Z_2 $ limit $ \\beta=1 $.\n  We find nearly perfect agreements between the strong coupling expansion and\nthe ED in the super-radiant regime.\n  We also compute the photon correlation functions, squeezing spectrum, number\ncorrelation functions which can be measured by various standard optical\ntechniques.\n", "  We study inelastic meson-meson scattering that is governed by quark-antiquark\nannihilation and creation involving a quark and an antiquark annihilating into\na gluon, and subsequently the gluon creating another quark-antiquark pair. The\nresultant hadronic reactions include for I=1: pion + pion to rho + rho, kaon +\nantikaon to kaon* + antikaon*, kaon + antikaon* to kaon* + antikaon*, kaon* +\nantikaon to kaon* + antikaon*, as well as pion + pion to kaon + antikaon, pion\n+ rho to kaon + antikaon*, pion + rho to kaon* + antikaon, and kaon + antikaon\nto rho + rho. In each reaction, one or two Feynman diagrams are involved in the\nBorn approximation. We derive formulas for the unpolarized cross section, the\ntransition amplitude, and the transition potential for quark-antiquark\nannihilation and creation. The unpolarized cross sections for the reactions are\ncalculated at six temperatures, and prominent temperature dependence is found.\nIt is due to differences among mesonic temperature dependence in hadronic\nmatter.\n", "  We provide a semiclassical description of framed BPS states in\nfour-dimensional N = 2 super Yang-Mills theories probed by 't Hooft defects, in\nterms of a supersymmetric quantum mechanics on the moduli space of singular\nmonopoles. Framed BPS states, like their ordinary counterparts in the theory\nwithout defects, are associated with the L^2 kernel of certain Dirac operators\non moduli space, or equivalently with the L^2 cohomology of related Dolbeault\noperators. The Dirac/Dolbeault operators depend on two Cartan-valued Higgs\nvevs. We conjecture a map between these vevs and the Seiberg-Witten special\ncoordinates, consistent with a one-loop analysis and checked in examples. The\nmap incorporates all perturbative and nonperturbative corrections that are\nrelevant for the semiclassical construction of BPS states, over a suitably\ndefined weak coupling regime of the Coulomb branch. We use this map to\ntranslate wall crossing formulae and the no-exotics theorem to statements about\nthe Dirac/Dolbeault operators. The no-exotics theorem, concerning the absence\nof nontrivial SU(2)_R representations in the BPS spectrum, implies that the\nkernel of the Dirac operator is chiral, and further translates into a statement\nthat all L^2 cohomology of the Dolbeault operator is concentrated in the middle\ndegree. Wall crossing formulae lead to detailed predictions for where the Dirac\noperators fail to be Fredholm and how their kernels jump. We explore these\npredictions in nontrivial examples. This paper explains the background and\narguments behind the results announced in a short accompanying note.\n", "  Numerically coefficients of the new analytical forms for deuteron wave\nfunction in coordinate space for NijmI, NijmII, Nijm93, Reid93 and Argonne v18\npotentials are designed. The obtained wave functions do not contain superfluous\nknots. The designed parameters of a deuteron well agree with the experimental\nand theoretical data. The tensor polarization t20 designed on wave functions is\nproportionate to earlier published outcomes.\n", "  We have conducted 1.1 mm ALMA observations of a contiguous $105'' \\times\n50''$ or 1.5 arcmin$^2$ window in the SXDF-UDS-CANDELS. We achieved a 5$\\sigma$\nsensitivity of 0.28 mJy, providing a flat sensus of dusty star-forming galaxies\nwith $L_{\\rm IR} \\sim6\\times10^{11}$ $L_\\odot$ (for $T_{\\rm dust}$ =40K) up to\n$z\\sim10$ thanks to the negative K-correction at this wavelength. We detected 5\nbrightest sources (S/N$>$6) and 18 low-significance sources (5$>$S/N$>$4; these\nmay contain spurious detections, though). One of the 5 brightest ALMA sources\n($S_{\\rm 1.1mm} = 0.84 \\pm 0.09$ mJy) is extremely faint in the WFC3 and\nVLT/HAWK-I images, demonstrating that a contiguous ALMA imaging survey is able\nto uncover a faint dust-obscured population that is invisible in deep\noptical/near-infrared surveys. We found a possible [CII]-line emitter at\n$z=5.955$ or a low-$z$ CO emitting galaxy within the field, which may allow us\nto constrain the [CII] and/or the CO luminosity functions across the history of\nthe universe.\n", "  A new accelerator complex, HIAF (the High Intensity Heavy Ion Accelerator\nFacility), has been approved in China. It is designed to provide intense\nprimary and radioactive ion beams for research in high energy density physics,\nnuclear physics, atomic physics as well as other applications. In order to\nachieve a high intensity of up to 5e11 ppp 238U34+, the Compression Ring\n(CRing) needs to stack more than 5 bunches transferred from the Booster Ring\n(BRing). However, the normal bucket to bucket injection scheme can only achieve\nan intensity gain of 2, so an injection method, fixed barrier bucket (BB)\nsupported by electron cooling, is proposed. To suppress the severe space charge\neffect during the stacking process, off-alignment is adopted in the cooler to\ncontrol the transverse emittance. In this paper, simulation and optimization\nwith the BETACOOL program are presented.\n", "  The meson $X(3872)$ and several related states appear to be, at least in\npart, hadronic molecules in which a heavy flavored meson (such as $D^0$) is\nbound to another heavy meson (such as $\\bar D^{*0}$). Although not the only\neffect contributing to the binding, pion exchange seems to play a crucial role\nin generating the longest-range force between constituents. Mesons without $u$\nand $d$ light quarks (such as $D_s$) cannot exchange pions, but under suitable\ncircumstances can bind as a result of $\\eta$ exchange. Channels in which this\nmechanism is possible are identified, and suggestions are made for searches for\nthe corresponding molecular states, including a manifestly exotic baryonic\n$\\Lambda_c \\bar D_s^*$ resonance decaying into $J/\\psi~\\Lambda$.\n", "  A variety of dynamics in nature and society can be approximately treated as a\ndriven and damped parametric oscillator. An intensive investigation of this\ntime-dependent model from an algebraic point of view provides a consistent\nmethod to resolve the classical dynamics and the quantum evolution in order to\nunderstand the time-dependent phenomena that occur not only in the macroscopic\nclassical scale for the synchronized behaviors but also in the microscopic\nquantum scale for a coherent state evolution. By using a Floquet\nU-transformation on a general time-dependent quadratic Hamiltonian, we exactly\nsolve the dynamic behaviors of a driven and damped parametric oscillator to\nobtain the optimal solutions by means of invariant parameters of $K$s to\ncombine with Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant method. This approach can discriminate\nthe external dynamics from the internal evolution of a wave packet by producing\nindependent parametric equations that dramatically facilitate the parametric\ncontrol on the quantum state evolution in a dissipative system. In order to\nshow the advantages of this method, several time-dependent models proposed in\nthe quantum control field are analyzed in details.\n", "  Macroscopic systems subjected to injection and dissipation of energy can\nexhibit complex spatiotemporal behaviors as result of dissipative\nself-organization. Here, we report a one and two dimensional pattern forming\nset up, which exhibits a transition from stationary patterns to spatiotemporal\nchaotic textures, based on a nematic liquid crystal layer with spatially\nmodulated input beam and optical feedback. Using an adequate projection of\nspatiotemporal diagrams, we determine the largest Lyapunov exponent. Jointly,\nthis exponent and Fourier transform allow us to distinguish between\nspatiotemporal chaos and amplitude turbulence concepts, which are usually\nmerged.\n", "  We consider two separate atoms interacting with a single-mode optical\nresonator. When the frequency of the resonator field is twice the atomic\ntransition frequency, we show that there exists a resonant coupling between\n\\textit{one} photon and \\textit{two} atoms, via intermediate virtual states\nconnected by counter-rotating processes. If the resonator is prepared in its\none-photon state, the photon can be jointly absorbed by the two atoms in their\nground state which will both reach their excited state with probability close\nto one. Like ordinary quantum Rabi oscillations, this process is coherent and\nreversible, so that two atoms in their excited state will undergo a downward\ntransition jointly emitting a single cavity photon. This joint absorption and\nemission processes can also occur with three atoms. The parameters used to\ninvestigate this process correspond to experimentally demonstrated values in\ncircuit quantum electrodynamics systems.\n", "  We give a simple form of the evolution equation and a scalar Lax pair for the\n$q$-Garnier system. Some reductions to the $q$-Painlev\\'e equations and the\nautonomous case as a generalized QRT system are discussed. Using two kinds of\nPad\\'e problems on differential grid and $q$-grid, we derive some special\nsolutions of the $q$-Garnier system in terms of the $q$-Appell Lauricella\nfunction and the generalized $q$-hypergeometric function.\n", "  In the past decade several theoretical Maxwell's demon models have been\nproposed exhibiting effects such as refrigerating, doing work at the cost of\ninformation, and some experiments have been done to realise these effects. Here\nwe propose a model with a two level demon, information represented by a\nsequence of bits, and two heat reservoirs. Which reservoir the demon interact\nwith depends on the bit. If information is pure, one reservoir will be\nrefrigerated, on the other hand, information can be erased if temperature\ndifference is large. Genuine examples of such a system are discussed.\n", "  Accurate and precise measurements of the Hubble constant are critical for\ntesting our current standard cosmological model and revealing possibly new\nphysics. With Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, each strong gravitational\nlens system with measured time delays can allow one to determine the Hubble\nconstant with an uncertainty of $\\sim 7\\%$. Since HST will not last forever, we\nexplore adaptive-optics (AO) imaging as an alternative that can provide higher\nangular resolution than HST imaging but has a less stable point spread function\n(PSF) due to atmospheric distortion. To make AO imaging useful for\ntime-delay-lens cosmography, we develop a method to extract the unknown PSF\ndirectly from the imaging of strongly lensed quasars. In a blind test with two\nmock data sets created with different PSFs, we are able to recover the\nimportant cosmological parameters (time-delay distance, external shear, lens\nmass profile slope, and total Einstein radius). Our analysis of the Keck AO\nimage of the strong lens system RXJ1131-1231 shows that the important\nparameters for cosmography agree with those based on HST imaging and modeling\nwithin 1-$\\sigma$ uncertainties. Most importantly, the constraint on the model\ntime-delay distance by using AO imaging with $0.045\"$resolution is tighter by\n$\\sim 50\\%$ than the constraint of time-delay distance by using HST imaging\nwith $0.09\"$when a power-law mass distribution for the lens system is adopted.\nOur PSF reconstruction technique is generic and applicable to data sets that\nhave multiple nearby point sources, enabling scientific studies that require\nhigh-precision models of the PSF.\n", "  We provide the first quantitative comparison between Barkhausen-noise\nexperiments and recent predictions from the theory of avalanches for pinned\ninterfaces, both in and beyond mean-field. We study different classes of soft\nmagnetic materials: polycrystals and amorphous samples, characterized by\nlong-range and short-range elasticity, respectively; both for thick and thin\nsamples, i.e. with and without eddy currents. The temporal avalanche shape at\nfixed size, and observables related to the joint distribution of sizes and\ndurations are analyzed in detail. Both long-range and short-range samples with\nno eddy currents are fitted extremely well by the theoretical predictions. In\nparticular, the short-range samples provide the first reliable test of the\ntheory beyond mean field. The thick samples show systematic deviations from the\nscaling theory, providing unambiguous signatures for the presence of eddy\ncurrents.\n", "  In this note, for $s \\in \\mathbb R$ and $1 \\leq p, r \\leq \\infty$, we\nintroduce and study Sobolev-Fourier-Lorentz spaces $\\dot{H}^s_{\\mathcal{L}^{p,\nr}}(\\mathbb{R}^d)$. In the family spaces $\\dot{H}^s_{\\mathcal{L}^{p,\nr}}(\\mathbb{R}^d)$, the critical invariant spaces for the Navier-Stokes\nequations correspond to the value $s = \\frac{d}{p} - 1$. When the initial datum\nbelongs to the critical spaces $\\dot{H}^{\\frac{d}{p} -\n1}_{\\mathcal{L}^{p,r}}(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ with $d \\geq 2, 1 \\leq p <\\infty$, and $1\n\\leq r < \\infty$, we establish the existence of local mild solutions to the\nCauchy problem for the Navier-Stokes equations in spaces $L^\\infty([0, T];\n\\dot{H}^{\\frac{d}{p} - 1}_{\\mathcal{L}^{p, r}}(\\mathbb{R}^d))$ with arbitrary\ninitial value, and existence of global mild solutions in spaces $L^\\infty([0,\n\\infty); \\dot{H}^{\\frac{d}{p} - 1}_{\\mathcal{L}^{p, r}}(\\mathbb{R}^d))$ when\nthe norm of the initial value in the Besov spaces $\\dot{B}^{\\frac{d}{\\tilde p}\n- 1, \\infty}_{\\mathcal{L} ^{\\tilde p,\\infty}}(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ is small enough,\nwhere $\\tilde p$ may take some suitable values.\n", "  Boost-invariant hadron production in high energy collisions occurs in\ncausally disconnected regions of finite space-time size. As a result, globally\nconserved quantum numbers (charge, strangeness, baryon number) are conserved\nlocally in spatially restricted correlation clusters. Their size is determined\nby two time scales: the equilibration time specifying the formation of a\nquark-gluon plasma, and the hadronization time, specifying the onset of\nconfinement. The expected values for these scales provide the theoretical basis\nfor the suppression observed for strangeness production in elementary\ninteractions ($pp$, $e^+e^-$) below LHC energies. In contrast, the space-time\nsuperposition of individual collisions in high energy heavy ion interactions\nleads to higher energy densities, resulting in much later hadronization and\nhence much larger hadronization volumes. This largely removes the causality\nconstraints and results in an ideal hadronic resonance gas in full chemical\nequilibrium. In the present paper, we determine the collision energies needed\nfor that; we also estimate when $pp$ collisions reach comparable hadronization\nvolumes and thus determine when strangeness suppression should disappear there\nas well.\n", "  We document the long-term evolution of an Agulhas ring detected from\nsatellite altimetry using a technique from nonlinear dynamical systems that\nenables objective (i.e., observer-independent) eddy framing. Such objectively\ndetected eddies have Lagrangian (material) boundaries that remain coherent\n(unfilamented) over the detection period. The ring preserves a quite compact\nmaterial entity for a period of about 2 years even after most initial coherence\nis lost within 5 months after detection. We attribute this to the successive\ndevelopment of short-term coherent material boundaries around the ring. These\nboundaries provide effective short-term shielding for the ring, which prevents\na large fraction of the ring's interior from being mixed with the ambient\nturbulent flow. We show that such coherence regain events cannot be inferred\nfrom Eulerian analysis. This process is terminated by a ring-splitting event\nwhich marks the ring demise, near the South American coast. The genesis of the\nring is characterized by a ring-merging event away from the Agulhas\nretroflection, followed by a 4-month-long partial coherence stage, scenario\nthat is quite different than a simple current occlusion and subsequent eddy\npinch off.\n", "  Supercritical collisionless perpendicular shocks have an average\nmacrostructure determined primarily by the dynamics of ions specularly\nreflected at the magnetic ramp. Within the overall macrostructure,\ninstabilities, both linear and nonlinear, generate fluctuations and\nmicrostructure. To identify the sources of such microstructure, high-resolution\ntwo- and three-dimensional simulations have been carried out using the hybrid\nmethod, wherein the ions are treated as particles and the electron response is\nmodelled as a massless fluid. We confirm the results of earlier 2-D simulations\nshowing both field-parallel aligned propagating fluctuations and fluctuations\ncarried by the reflected-gyrating ions. In addition, it is shown that, for 2-D\nsimulations of the shock coplanarity plane, the presence of short-wavelength\nfluctuations in all magnetic components is associated with the ion Weibel\ninstability driven at the upstream edge of the foot by the reflected-gyrating\nions. In 3-D simulations we show for the first time that the dominant\nmicrostructure is due to a coupling between field-parallel propagating\nfluctuations in the ramp and the motion of the reflected ions. This results in\na pattern of fluctuations counter-propagating across the surface of the shock\nat an angle inclined to the magnetic field direction, due to a combination of\nfield-parallel motion at the Alfv\\'en speed of the ramp, and motion in the\nsense of gyration of the reflected ions.\n", "  Motivated by the recent experiment of the non-BCS scaling relation of the\ncondensation energy $\\Delta CE$ vs. $T_c$ ($\\Delta CE \\sim T_c ^{\\beta},\n\\beta\\approx 3.5$) [PRB 89 140503 (2014)] for the Fe-based superconductors, we\nstudied the CE and $T_c$ of the multiband BCS superconductors. We showed that\nthe experimentally observed anomalous scaling relation $\\Delta CE \\sim T_c\n^{3.5}$ is well reproduced by the two-band BCS superconductor paired by a\ndominant interband interaction ($V_{inter} > V_{intra}$). Our result implies\nthat this seemingly non-BCS-like scaling behavior, on the contrary to the\ncommon expectation, is in fact a strong experimental evidence that the pairing\nmechanism of the Fe-based superconductors is genuinely a BCS mechanism, meaning\nthat \"the Cooper pairs are formed by the itinerant carriers glued by a pairing\ninteraction.\"\n", "  We present a complete hyperentangled Bell state analysis protocol for\ntwo-photon four-qubit states which are simultaneously entangled in the\npolarization and time-bin degrees of freedom. The 16 hyperentangled states can\nbe unambiguously distinguished via two steps. In the first step, the\npolarization entangled state is distinguished deterministically and\nnondestructively with the help of the cross-Kerr nonlinearity. Then, in the\nsecond step, the time-bin state is analyzed with the aid of the polarization\nentanglement. We also discuss the applications of our protocol for quantum\ninformation processing. Compared with hyperentanglement in polarization and\nspatial-mode degrees of freedom, the polarization and time-bin hyperentangled\nstates provide saving in quantum resources since there is no requirement for\ntwo spatial modes for each photon. This is the first complete hyperentangled\nBell state analysis scheme for polarization and time-bin hyperentangled states,\nand it can provide new avenues for high-capacity, long-distance quantum\ncommunication.\n", "  We consider a non acoustic chain of harmonic oscillators with the dynamics\nperturbed by a random local exchange of momentum, such that energy and momentum\nare conserved. The macroscopic limits of the energy density, momentum and the\ncurvature (or bending) of the chain satisfy a system of evolution equations}.\nWe prove that, in a diffusive space-time scaling, the curvature and momentum\nevolve following a linear system that corresponds to a damped Euler-Bernoulli\nbeam equation. The macroscopic energy density evolves following a non linear\ndiffusive equation. In particular the energy transfer is diffusive in this\ndynamics. This provides a first rigorous example of a normal diffusion of\nenergy in a one dimensional dynamics that conserves the momentum.\n", "  We study transport properties of an array created by alternating $(a,b)$\nlayers with balanced loss/gain characterized by the key parameter $\\gamma$. It\nis shown that for non-equal widths of $(a,b)$ layers, i.e., when the\ncorresponding Hamiltonian is non-PT-symmetric, the system exhibits the\nscattering properties similar to those of truly PT-symmetric models provided\nthat without loss/gain the structure presents the matched quarter stack. The\ninclusion of the loss/gain terms leads to an emergence of a finite number of\nspectral bands characterized by real values of the Bloch index. Each spectral\nband consists of a central region where the transmission coefficient $T_N \\geq\n1$, and two side regions with $T_N \\leq 1$. At the borders between these\nregions the unidirectional reflectivity occurs. Also, the set of Fabry-Perrot\nresonances with $T_N=1$ are found in spite of the presence of loss/gain.\n", "  Several powerful techniques exist to detect topologically protected surface\nstates of weakly-interacting electronic systems. In contrast, surface modes of\nstrongly interacting systems which do not carry electric charge are much harder\nto detect. We propose resonant light scattering as a means of probing the\nchargeless surface modes of interacting quantum spin systems, and illustrate\nits efficacy by a concrete calculation for the 3D hyperhoneycomb Kitaev quantum\nspin liquid phase. We show that resonant scattering is required to efficiently\ncouple to this model's sublattice polarized surface modes, comprised of\nemergent Majorana fermions that result from spin fractionalization. We\ndemonstrate that the low-energy response is dominated by the surface\ncontribution for thin films, allowing identification and characterization of\nemergent topological band structures.\n", "  Space-time evolution of relativistic electron beam driven wake-field in a\ncold, homogeneous plasma, is studied using 1D-fluid simulation techniques. It\nis observed that the wake wave gradu- ally evolves and eventually breaks,\nexhibiting sharp spikes in the density profile and sawtooth like features in\nthe electric field profile [1]. It is shown here that the excited wakefield is\na longitudi- nal Akhiezer-Polovin mode [2] and its steepening (breaking) can be\nunderstood in terms of phase mixing of this mode, which arises because of\nrelativistic mass variation effects. Further the phase mixing time (breaking\ntime) is studied as a function of beam density and beam velocity and is found\nto follow the well known scaling presented in ref.[3].\n", "  One of the methods to calculate tree-level multi-gluon scattering amplitudes\nis to use the Berends-Giele recursion relation involving off-shell currents or\noff-shell amplitudes, if working in the light cone gauge. As shown in recent\nworks using the light-front perturbation theory, solutions to these recursions\nnaturally collapse into gauge invariant and gauge-dependent components, at\nleast for some helicity configurations. In this work, we show that such\nstructure is helicity independent and emerges from analytic properties of\nmatrix elements of Wilson line operators, where the slope of the straight gauge\npath is shifted in a certain complex direction. This is similar to the\nprocedure leading to the Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten (BCFW) recursion, however\nwe apply a complex shift to the Wilson line slope instead of the external\nmomenta. While in the original BCFW procedure the boundary integrals over the\ncomplex shift vanish for certain deformations, here they are non-zero and are\nequal to the off-shell amplitudes. The main result can thus be summarized as\nfollows: we derive a decomposition of a helicity-fixed off-shell current into\ngauge invariant component given by a matrix element of a straight Wilson line\nplus a reminder given by a sum of products of gauge invariant and gauge\ndependent quantities. We give several examples realizing this relation,\nincluding the five-point next-to-MHV helicity configuration.\n", "  A simple core-shell two-dimensional photonic crystal is studied where the\ntriangle lattice symmetry and $C_{6v}$ rotation symmetry leads to rich physics\nin the study of accidental degeneracy's in photonic bands. We systematically\nevaluate different types of accidental nodal points, depending on the\ndispersions around them and their topological properties, when the geometry and\npermittivity are continuously changed. These accidental nodal points can be the\ncritical states lying between a topological phase and a normal phase and are\nthus important for the study of topological photonic states. In time-reversal\nsystems, this leads to the photonic quantum spin Hall insulator where the spin\nis defined upon the orbital angular momentum for transverse-magnetic\npolarization. We study the topological phase transition as well as the\nproperties of the edge and bulk states and their application potentials in\noptics.\n", "  We initiate the conformal bootstrap study of Quantum Electrodynamics in $2+1$\nspace-time dimensions (QED$_{3}$) with $N$ flavors of charged fermions by\nfocusing on the 4-point function of four monopole operators with the lowest\nunit of topological charge. We obtain upper bounds on the scaling dimension of\nthe doubly-charged monopole operator, with and without assuming other gaps in\nthe operator spectrum. Intriguingly, we find a (gap-dependent) kink in these\nbounds that comes reasonably close to the large $N$ extrapolation of the\nscaling dimensions of the singly-charged and doubly-charged monopole operators\ndown to $N=4$ and $N=6$.\n", "  The accurate determination of transport coefficients in numerical simulations\nis becoming increasingly important in a wide range of applications. Here we\nconsider the linear response in systems driven away from thermal equilibrium\ninto a non-equilibrium steady state with non-vanishing entropy production rate.\nA simple derivation of a general response formula is presented. For Markov\nprocesses we explicitly construct the conjugate quantities and discuss their\nrelation with known response formulas. Emphasis is put on the formal analogy\nwith thermodynamic potentials and some consequences are discussed.\n", "  Topological insulators are states of matter distinguished by the presence of\nsymmetry protected metallic boundary states. These edge modes have been\ncharacterised in terms of transport and spectroscopic measurements, but a\nthermodynamic description has been lacking. The challenge arises because in\nconventional thermodynamics the potentials are required to scale linearly with\nextensive variables like volume, which does not allow for a general treatment\nof boundary effects. In this paper, we overcome this challenge with Hill\nthermodynamics. In this extension of the thermodynamic formalism, the grand\npotential is split into an extensive, conventional contribution, and the\nsubdivision potential, which is the central construct of Hill's theory. For\ntopologically non-trivial electronic matter, the subdivision potential captures\nmeasurable contributions to the density of states and the heat capacity: it is\nthe thermodynamic manifestation of the topological edge structure. Furthermore,\nthe subdivision potential reveals phase transitions of the edge even when they\nare not manifested in the bulk, thus opening a variety of new possibilities for\ninvestigating, manipulating, and characterizing topological quantum matter\nsolely in terms of equilibrium boundary physics.\n", "  In this work, we analytically report Coherent Perfect Absorption induced by\nthe acoustic nonlinear response of a Helmholtz Resonator side loaded to a\nwaveguide. In particular, we show that this two-port acoustic system can\nperfectly absorb two high amplitude symmetric incident waves when the additive\nnonlinear losses in the HR, induced by the jet flow separation, together with\nthe weak linear viscothermal losses of the HR balance the radiation losses to\nthe waveguide. For the case of the one-sided incidence configuration, this\ncondition leads to an absorption equal to 0.5. This result, which is verified\nexperimentally, is in a good agreement with an analytical nonlinear model of\nthe impedance of the HR. The nonlinear control of perfect absorption using\nresonators will open new possibilities in the design of high amplitude sound\nattenuators for aero-engine applications.\n", "  In this paper, we derive a viscous generalization of the Dysthe (1979) system\nfrom the weakly viscous generalization of the Euler equations introduced by\nDias, Dyachenko, and Zakharov (2008). This \"viscous Dysthe\" system models the\nevolution of a weakly viscous, nearly monochromatic wave train on deep water.\nIt contains a term which provides a mechanism for frequency downshifting in the\nabsence of wind and wave breaking. The equation does not preserve the spectral\nmean. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the spectral mean typically\ndecreases and that the spectral peak decreases for certain initial conditions.\nThe linear stability analysis of the plane-wave solutions of the viscous Dysthe\nsystem demonstrates that waves with wave numbers closer to zero decay more\nslowly than waves with wave numbers further from zero. Comparisons between\nexperimental data and numerical simulations of the NLS, dissipative NLS,\nDysthe, and viscous Dysthe systems establish that the viscous Dysthe system\naccurately models data from experiments in which frequency downshifting was\nobserved and experiments in which frequency downshift was not observed.\n", "  We investigate a number of formal properties of the adiabatic\nstrictly-correlated electrons (SCE) functional, relevant for time-dependent\npotentials and for kernels in linear response time-dependent density functional\ntheory. Among the former, we focus on the compliance to constraints of exact\nmany-body theories, such as the generalised translational invariance and the\nzero-force theorem. Within the latter, we derive an analytical expression for\nthe adiabatic SCE Hartree exchange-correlation kernel in one dimensional\nsystems, and we compute it numerically for a variety of model densities. We\nanalyse the non-local features of this kernel, particularly the ones that are\nrelevant in tackling problems where kernels derived from local or semi-local\nfunctionals are known to fail.\n", "  We investigate the magneto-optical properties of excitons bound to single\nstacking faults in high-purity GaAs. We find that the two-dimensional stacking\nfault potential binds an exciton composed of an electron and a heavy-hole, and\nconfirm a vanishing in-plane hole $g$-factor, consistent with the atomic-scale\nsymmetry of the system. The unprecedented homogeneity of the stacking-fault\npotential leads to ultra-narrow photoluminescence emission lines (with\nfull-width at half maximum ${\\lesssim 80~\\mu \\text{eV} }$) and reveals a large\nmagnetic non-reciprocity effect that originates from the magneto-Stark effect\nfor mobile excitons. These measurements unambiguously determine the direction\nand magnitude of the giant electric dipole moment (${\\gtrsim e \\cdot\n10~\\text{nm}}$) of the stacking-fault exciton, making stacking faults a\npromising new platform to study interacting excitonic gases.\n", "  With the eventual aim of classifying renormalization group flows between 6D\nsuperconformal field theories (SCFTs), we study flows generated by the vevs of\n\"conformal matter,\" a generalization of conventional hypermultiplets which\nnaturally appear in the F-theory classification of 6D SCFTs. We consider flows\nin which the parent UV theory is (on its partial tensor branch) a linear chain\nof gauge groups connected by conformal matter, with one flavor group G at each\nend of the chain, and in which the symmetry breaking of the conformal matter at\neach end is parameterized by the orbit of a nilpotent element, i.e. T-brane\ndata, of one of these flavor symmetries. Such nilpotent orbits admit a partial\nordering, which is reflected in a hierarchy of IR fixed points. For each such\nnilpotent orbit, we determine the corresponding tensor branch for the resulting\nSCFT. An important feature of this algebraic approach is that it also allows us\nto systematically compute the unbroken flavor symmetries inherited from the\nparent UV theory.\n", "  The Schr\\\"odinger Hamiltonian of a spin zero particle as well as the Pauli\nHamiltonian with spin-orbit coupling included of a spin one-half particle in\nelectromagnetic fields that are confined to a curved surface embedded in a\nthree-dimensional space spanned by a general Orthogonal Curvilinear Coordinate\n(OCC) are constructed. A new approach, based on the physical argument that upon\nsqueezing the particle to the surface by a potential, then it is the physical\ngauge-covariant kinematical momentum operator (velocity operator) transverse to\nthe surface that should be dropped from the Hamiltonian(s). In both cases,the\nresulting Hermitian gauge-invariant Hamiltonian on the surface is free from any\nreference to the component of the vector potential transverse to the surface,\nand the approach is completely gauge-independent. In particular, for the Pauli\nHamiltonian these results are obtained exactly without any further assumptions\nor approximations. Explicit covariant plug-and-play formulae for the\nSchr\\\"odinger Hamiltonians on the surfaces of a cylinder, a sphere and a torus\nare derived.\n", "  Finding alternative optoelectronic mechanisms that overcome the limitations\nof conventional semiconductor devices is paramount for detecting and harvesting\nlow-energy photons. A highly promising approach is to drive a current from the\nthermal energy added to the free-electron bath as a result of light absorption.\nSuccessful implementation of this strategy requires a broadband absorber where\ncarriers interact among themselves more strongly than with phonons, as well as\nenergy-selective contacts to extract the excess electronic heat. Here we show\nthat graphene-WSe2-graphene heterostructure devices offer this possibility\nthrough the photo-thermionic effect: the absorbed photon energy in graphene is\nefficiently transferred to the electron bath, leading to a thermalized hot\ncarrier distribution. Carriers with energy higher than the Schottky barrier\nbetween graphene and WSe2 can be emitted over the barrier, thus creating\nphotocurrent. We experimentally demonstrate that the photo-thermionic effect\nenables detection of sub-bandgap photons, while being size-scalable,\nelectrically tunable, broadband and ultrafast.\n", "  We study the formation of extreme events in incoherent systems described by\nenvelope equations, such as the Nonliner Schr\\\"odinger equation. We derive an\nidentity that relates the evolution of the kurtosis (a measure of the relevance\nof the tails in a probability density function) of the wave amplitude to the\nrate of change of the width of the Fourier spectrum of the wave field. The\nresult is exact for all dispersive systems characterized by a nonlinear term of\nthe form of the one contained in the Nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation.\nNumerical simulations are also performed to confirm our findings. Our work\nsheds some light on the origin of rogue waves in incoherent dispersive\nnonlinear media ruled by local cubic nonlinearity.\n", "  We consider the Einstein-dust equations with positive cosmological constant\n$\\lambda$ on manifolds with time slices diffeomorphic to an orientable, compact\n3-manifold $S$. It is shown that the set of standard Cauchy data for the\nEinstein-$\\lambda$-dust equations on $S$ contains an open (in terms of suitable\nSobolev norms) subset of data that develop into solutions which admit at future\ntime-like infinity a space-like conformal boundary ${\\cal J}^+$ that is\n$C^{\\infty}$ if the data are of class $C^{\\infty}$ and of correspondingly lower\nsmoothness otherwise. As a particular case follows a strong stability result\nfor FLRW solutions. The solutions can conveniently be characterized in terms of\ntheir asymptotic end data induced on ${\\cal J}^+$, only a linear equation must\nbe solved to construct such data. In the case where the energy density\n$\\hat{\\rho}$ is everywhere positive such data can be constructed without\nsolving any differential equation at all.\n", "  Starting with QCD, we derive an effective field theory description for\nforward scattering and factorization violation as part of the soft-collinear\neffective field theory (SCET) for high energy scattering. These phenomena are\nmediated by long distance Glauber gluon exchanges, which are static in time,\nlocalized in the longitudinal distance, where $|t| \\ll s$. In hard scattering,\nGlauber gluons can induce corrections which invalidate factorization. With\nSCET, Glauber exchange graphs can be calculated explicitly, and are distinct\nfrom graphs with soft, collinear, or ultrasoft gluons. We derive a complete\nbasis of operators which describe the leading power effects of Glauber\nexchange. Key ingredients include regulating light-cone rapidity singularities\nand subtractions which prevent double counting. Our results include a novel all\norders gauge invariant pure glue soft operator which appears between two\ncollinear rapidity sectors. The 1-gluon Feynman rule for the soft operator\ncoincides with the Lipatov vertex, but it also contributes to emissions with\n$\\ge 2$ soft gluons. Our Glauber operator basis is derived using tree level and\none-loop matching calculations from full QCD to SCET. The rapidity RGE yields\ngluon Reggeization at the amplitude level, and gives the BFKL equation for the\nsoft and collinear functions in the forward scattering cross section. We derive\nan explicit rule for when eikonalization is valid, and provide a direct\nconnection to the picture of multiple Wilson lines crossing a shockwave. In\nhard scattering operators Glauber subtractions for soft and collinear loop\ndiagrams ensure that we are not sensitive to the directions for soft and\ncollinear Wilson lines. Conversely, certain Glauber interactions can be\nabsorbed into these soft and collinear Wilson lines by taking them to be in\nspecific directions. We also discuss criteria for factorization violation.\n", "  We report ab initio calculations showing that a single one-dimensional\nextended defect can originate topologically-protected metallic states in the\nbulk of two-dimensional topological insulators. We find that a narrow extended\ndefect composed of periodic units consisting of one octogonal and two\npentagonal rings embedded in the hexagonal bulk of a bismuth bilayer introduces\ntwo pairs of one-dimensional Dirac-fermion states with opposite spin-momentum\nlocking. Although both Dirac pairs are localized along the extended-defect\ncore, their interactions are screened due to the trivial topological nature of\nthe extended defect.\n", "  An orthogonal basis of the Hilbert space for the quantum spin chain\nassociated with the su(3) algebra is introduced. Such kind of basis could be\ntreated as a nested generalization of separation of variables (SoV) basis for\nhigh-rank quantum integrable models. It is found that all the monodromy-matrix\nelements acting on a basis vector take simple forms. With the help of the\nbasis, we construct eigenstates of the su(3) inhomogeneous spin torus (the\ntrigonometric su(3) spin chain with antiperiodic boundary condition) from its\nspectrum obtained via the off-diagonal Bethe Ansatz (ODBA). Based on small\nsites (i.e. N=2) check, it is conjectured that the homogeneous limit of the\neigenstates exists, which gives rise to the corresponding eigenstates of the\nhomogenous model.\n", "  The Poincar\\'e invariant vacuum is not unique in quantum gravity. The BMS\nsupertranslation symmetry originally defined at null infinity is spontaneously\nbroken and results in inequivalent Poincar\\'e vacua. In this paper we construct\nthe unique vacua which interpolate between past and future null infinity in BMS\ngauge and which are entirely characterized by an arbitary Goldstone boson\ndefined on the sphere which breaks BMS invariance. We show that these vacua\ncontain a defect which carries no Poincar\\'e charges but which generically\ncarries superrotation charges. We argue that there is a huge degeneracy of\nvacua with multiple defects. We also present the single defect vacua with its\ncanonically conjugated source which can be constructed from a Liouville boson\non the stereographic plane. We show that positivity of the energy forces the\nstress-tensor of the boson to vanish as a boundary condition. Finite\nsuperrotations, which turn on the sources, are therefore physically ruled out\nas canonical transformations around the vacua. Yet, infinitesimal\nsuperrotations are external symplectic symmetries which are associated with\nconserved charges which characterize the Goldstone boson.\n", "  Jets are an important probe to identify the hard interaction of interest at\nthe LHC. They are routinely used in Standard Model precision measurements as\nwell as in searches for new heavy particles, including jet substructure\nmethods. In processes with several jets, one typically encounters hierarchies\nin the jet transverse momenta and/or dijet invariant masses. Large logarithms\nof the ratios of these kinematic jet scales in the cross section are at present\nprimarily described by parton showers. We present a general factorization\nframework called SCET$_+$, which is an extension of Soft-Collinear Effective\nTheory (SCET) and allows for a systematic higher-order resummation of such\nkinematic logarithms for generic jet hierarchies. In SCET$_+$ additional\nintermediate soft/collinear modes are used to resolve jets arising from\nadditional soft and/or collinear QCD emissions. The resulting factorized cross\nsections utilize collinear splitting amplitudes and soft gluon currents and\nfully capture spin and color correlations. We discuss how to systematically\ncombine the different kinematic regimes to obtain a complete description of the\njet phase space. To present its application in a simple context, we use the\ncase of $e^+e^- \\to $3 jets. We then discuss in detail the application to N-jet\nprocesses at hadron colliders, considering representative classes of\nhierarchies from which the general case can be built. This includes in\nparticular multiple hierarchies that are either strongly ordered in angle or\nenergy or not.\n", "  We discuss the glueball contribution to the equation of state (EoS) of hot\ngluon matter below and above $T_c$. It is shown that the strong changing of\nmasses of scalar and pseudoscalar glueballs near $T_c$ plays very important\nrole in the thermodynamics of $SU(3)$ gauge theory. In particular, we give the\narguments that these glueballs become massless at $T_G\\approx 1.1T_c$ and this\nphenomenon is crucial in understanding of the mystery in the behavior of trace\nanomaly founded in the lattice calculation.\n", "  Heavily-doped semiconductor films are very promising for application in\nmid-infrared plasmonic devices because the real part of their dielectric\nfunction is negative and broadly tunable in this wavelength range. In this work\nwe investigate heavily n-type doped germanium epilayers grown on different\nsubstrates, in-situ doped in the $10^{17}$ to $10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$ range, by\ninfrared spectroscopy, first principle calculations, pump-probe spectroscopy\nand dc transport measurements to determine the relation between plasma edge and\ncarrier density and to quantify mid-infrared plasmon losses. We demonstrate\nthat the unscreened plasma frequency can be tuned in the 400 - 4800 cm$^{-1}$\nrange and that the average electron scattering rate, dominated by scattering\nwith optical phonons and charged impurities, increases almost linearly with\nfrequency. We also found weak dependence of losses and tunability on the\ncrystal defect density, on the inactivated dopant density and on the\ntemperature down to 10 K. In films where the plasma was optically activated by\npumping in the near-infrared, we found weak but significant dependence of\nrelaxation times on the static doping level of the film. Our results suggest\nthat plasmon decay times in the several-picosecond range can be obtained in\nn-type germanium thin films grown on silicon substrates hence allowing for\nunderdamped mid-infrared plasma oscillations at room temperature.\n", "  The state of polarization and the carrier phase drift dynamically during\ntransmission in a random fashion in coherent optical fiber communications. The\ntypical digital signal processing solution to mitigate these impairments\nconsists of two separate blocks that track each phenomenon independently. Such\nalgorithms have been developed without taking into account mathematical models\ndescribing the impairments. We study a blind, model-based tracking algorithm to\ncompensate for these impairments. The algorithm dynamically recovers the\ncarrier phase and state of polarization jointly for an arbitrary modulation\nformat. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm,\nhaving a fast convergence rate and an excellent tolerance to phase noise and\ndynamic drift of the polarization. The computational complexity of the\nalgorithm is lower compared to state-of-the-art algorithms at similar or better\nperformance, which makes it a strong candidate for future optical systems.\n", "  In this letter we study the Higgs mass in the NMSSM with supersymmetry\nbreaking at high scales $M_{SS}$. With the Standard Model as the effective low\nenergy theory, the computation of the Higgs mass relies on the matching\ncondition of the quartic coupling $\\lambda$ at $M_{SS}$. In the MSSM, the\nlatter is fixed to a semi-positive value and, thus, sets an upper bound on the\nSUSY-breaking scale near $M_{SS}\\simeq 10^{10}\\text{GeV}$. In the NMSSM,\n$\\lambda(M_{SS})$ receives an additional contribution induced by the singlet\nwhich allows for negative values of $\\lambda(M_{SS})$. In turn, for the\nmeasured value of the Higgs mass we find that $M_{SS}$ can take any value up to\nthe GUT scale. Furthermore, the choice of universal soft terms favors\nSUSY-breaking scales close to the GUT scale.\n", "  Pulse propagation is studied in an EIT medium with the control field having a\nperiodically varying phase (chirp). Based both on numerical calculations and on\nan approximate approach neglecting absorption and nonadiabatic effects, it is\nshown that transparency occurs for probe pulses having a sufficiently narrow\nenvelope and an appropriately suited chirp. For other chirped pulses the\nevolution of their spectra along a sample is studied. Using a projection method\none can divide a pulse into a part for which the medium is transparent and a\nrest for which it is opaque.\n", "  The negative-U impurity stripes confining the edge channels of semiconductor\nquantum wells are shown to allow the effective cooling inside in the process of\nthe spin-dependent transport. The aforesaid promotes also the creation of\ncomposite bosons and fermions by the capture of single magnetic flux quanta on\nthe edge channels under the conditions of low sheet density of carriers, thus\nopening new opportunities for the registration of the quantum kinetic phenomena\nin weak magnetic fields at high temperatures up to the room temperature. As a\ncertain version noted above we present the first findings of the high\ntemperature de Haas-van Alphen, 300K, and quantum Hall, 77K, effects in the\nsilicon sandwich structure that represents the ultra-narrow, 2 nm, p-type\nquantum well (Si-QW) confined by the delta barriers heavily doped with boron on\nthe n-type Si (100) surface. These data appear to result from the low density\nof single holes that are of small effective mass in the edge channels of p-type\nSi-QW because of the impurity confinement by the stripes consisting of the\nnegative-U dipole boron centers which seems to give rise to the efficiency\nreduction of the electron-electron interaction.\n", "  We estimate the expected event rate of gravitational wave signals from\nmergers of supermassive black holes that could be resolved by a space-based\ninterferometer, such as the Evolved Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (eLISA),\nutilising the reference cosmological hydrodynamical simulation from the EAGLE\nsuite. These simulations assume a $\\Lambda$CDM cosmogony with state-of-the-art\nsubgrid models for radiative cooling, star formation, stellar mass loss, and\nfeedback from stars and accreting black holes. They have been shown to\nreproduce the observed galaxy population with unprecedented fidelity. We\ncombine the merger rates of supermassive black holes in EAGLE with the latest\nphenomenological waveform models to calculate the gravitational waves signals\nfrom the intrinsic parameters of the merging black holes. The EAGLE models\npredict $\\sim2$ detections per year by a gravitational wave detector such as\neLISA. We find that these signals are largely dominated by mergers between seed\nmass black holes merging at redshifts between $z\\sim2$ and $z\\sim1$. In order\nto investigate the dependence on the assumed black hole seed mass, we introduce\nan additional model with a black hole seed mass an order of magnitude smaller\nthan in our reference model. We also consider a variation of the reference\nmodel where a prescription for the expected delays in the black hole merger\ntimescale has been included after their host galaxies merge. We find that the\nmerger rate is similar in all models, but that the initial black hole seed mass\ncould be distinguished through their detected gravitational waveforms. Hence,\nthe characteristic gravitational wave signals detected by eLISA will provide\nprofound insight into the origin of supermassive black holes and the initial\nmass distribution of black hole seeds.\n", "  Randomness is an indispensable resource in modern science and information\ntechnology. Fortunately, an experimentally simple procedure exists to generate\nrandomness with well-characterized devices: measuring a quantum system in a\nbasis complementary to its preparation. Towards realizing this goal one may\nconsider using atoms or superconducting qubits, promising candidates for\nquantum information processing. However, their unavoidable interaction with the\nelectromagnetic field affects their dynamics. At large time scales, this can\nresult in decoherence. Smaller time scales in principle avoid this problem, but\nmay not be well analysed under the usual rotating wave and single-mode\napproximation (RWA and SMA) which break the relativistic nature of quantum\nfield theory. Here, we use a fully relativistic analysis to quantify the\ninformation that an adversary with access to the field could get on the result\nof an atomic measurement. Surprisingly, we find that the adversary's guessing\nprobability is not minimized for atoms initially prepared in the ground state\n(an intuition derived from the RWA and SMA model).\n", "  In order to study the dynamic response of the material and the physical\nmechanism of the fluid dynamics, an accelerator scenario which can be applied\nto hard X-ray free electron laser and high energy electron radiography was\nproposed. This accelerator is mainly composed of a 12GeV linac, an undulator\nbranch and an eRad beamline. In order to characterize sample's dynamic behavior\nin situ and real-time with XFEL and eRad simultaneously, the linac should be\ncapable of accelerating the two kinds of beam within the same operation mode.\nCombining with in-vacuum and tapering techniques, the undulator branch can\nproduce more than 1E11 photons per pulse in 0.1 precent bandwidth at 42keV.\nFinally, the eRad amplifying beamline with 1:10 ratio was proposed as an\nimportant complementary tool for the wider view field and density\nidentification ability.\n", "  We study the statistical distribution of components in the non-perturbative\nparts of energy eigenfunctions (EFs), in which main bodies of the EFs lie. Our\nnumerical simulations in five models show that deviation of the distribution\nfrom the prediction of random matrix theory (RMT) is useful in characterizing\nthe process from nearly-integrable to chaotic, in a way somewhat similar to the\nnearest-level-spacing distribution. But, the statistics of EFs reveals some\nmore properties, as described below. (i) In the process of approaching quantum\nchaos, the distribution of components shows a delay feature compared with the\nnearest-level-spacing distribution in most of the models studied. (ii) In the\nquantum chaotic regime, the distribution of components always shows small but\nnotable deviation from the prediction of RMT in models possessing classical\nunterparts, while, the deviation can be almost negligible in models not\npossessing classical counterparts. (iii) In models whose Hamiltonian matrices\npossess a clear band structure, tails of EFs show statistical behaviors\nobviously different from those in the main bodies, while, the difference is\nsmaller for Hamiltonian matrices without a clear band structure.\n", "  We analyze the behavior of Free Electron Laser (FEL) oscillators operating in\nthe deep saturated regime and point out the formation of sub-peaks of the\noptical pulse. They are very stable configurations, having a width\ncorresponding to a coherence length. We speculate on the physical mechanisms\nunderlying their growth and attempt an identification with FEL mode locked\nstructures associated with Super Modes. Their impact on the intra-cavity\nnonlinear harmonic generation is also discussed along with the possibility of\nexploiting them as cavity out-coupler.\n", "  Statistics of distinguishable particles has become relevant in systems of\ncolloidal particles and in the context of applications of statistical mechanics\nto complex networks. When studying these type of systems with the standard\ntextbook formalism, non-physical results such as non-extensive entropies are\nobtained. In this paper, we will show that the commonly used expression for the\npartition function of a system of distinguishable particles leads to huge\nfluctuations of the number of particles in the grand canonical ensemble and,\nconsequently, to non-equivalence of statistical ensembles. We will see how a\nnew proposed definition for the entropy of distinguishable particles by\nSwendsen [J. Stat. Phys. 107, 1143 (2002)] solves the problem and restores\nensemble equivalence. We also show that the new proposal for the partition\nfunction does not produce any inconsistency for a system of distinguishable\nlocalized particles, where the monoparticular partition function is not\nextensive.\n", "  We experimentally study an optomechanical cavity that is formed between a\nmechanical resonator, which serves as a movable mirror, and a stationary\non-fiber dielectric mirror. A significant change in the behavior of the system\nis observed when the distance between the fiber's tip and the mechanical\nresonator is made smaller than about 1 micrometer. The observed effects are\nattributed to the combined influence of Casimir force, Coulomb interaction due\nto trapped charges, and optomechanical coupling. The comparison between\nexperimental results and theory yields a partial agreement.\n", "  Solitons are very promising for the design of next generation of ultralow\npower devices for storage and computation. The key ingredient to achieve this\ngoal is the fundamental understanding of their stabilization and manipulation.\nHere, we show how the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii Moriya Interaction (i DMI) is\nable to lift the energy degeneracy of a magnetic vortex state by stabilizing a\ntopological soliton with radial chirality, hereafter called radial vortex. It\nhas a non-integer skyrmion number S (0.5<|S|<1) due to both the vortex core\npolarity and the magnetization tilting induced by the i DMI boundary\nconditions. Micromagnetic simulations predict that a magnetoresistive memory\nbased on the radial vortex state in both free and polarizer layers can be\nefficiently switched by a threshold current density smaller than 106 A/cm2. The\nswitching processes occur via the nucleation of topologically connected\nvortices and vortex antivortex pairs, followed by spin wave emissions due to\nvortex antivortex annihilations.\n", "  The electron detachment from the hydrogen negative ion in strong fields is\nstudied using the two-electron and different single-electron models within the\nquasistatic approximation. A special attention is payed to over-the-barrier\nregime where the Stark saddle is suppressed below the lowest energy level. It\nis demonstrated that the single-electron description of the lowest state of\nion, that is a good approximation for weak fields, fails in this and partially\nin the tunneling regime. The exact lowest state energies and detachment rates\nfor the ion at different strengths of the applied field are determined by\nsolving the eigenvalue problem of the full two-electron Hamiltonian. An\naccurate formula for the rate, that is valid in both regimes, is determined by\nfitting the exact data to the expression estimated using single-electron\ndescriptions.\n", "  Vesta is the only currently identified asteroid for which we possess samples,\nwhich revealed us that the asteroid is differentiated and possesses a\nrelatively thin basaltic crust that survived to the evolution of the asteroid\nbelt and the Solar System. However, little is know about the effects of past\nevents like the Late Heavy Bombardment on this crust. We address this gap in\nour knowledge by simulating the LHB in the different dynamical scenarios\nproposed for the migration of the giant planets in the broad framework of the\nNice Model. The results of simulations generate information about produced\ncrater population, surface saturation, mass loss and mass gain of Vesta and\nnumber of energetic or catastrophic impacts during LHB. Our results reveal that\nplanet-planet scattering is a dynamically favourable migration mechanism for\nthe survival of Vesta and its crust. The number of impacts on Vesta estimated\nas due to the LHB is $31\\pm5$, i.e. about 5 times larger than the number of\nimpacts that would have occurred in an unperturbed main belt in the same time\ninterval. The contribution of a possible extended belt, instead, is quite\nlimited and can be quantified in $2\\pm1$ impacts. The chance of energetic and\ncatastrophic impacts is less than 10\\% and is compatible with the absence of\ngiant craters dated back to 4 Ga ago and with the survival of the asteroid\nduring the LHB. The mass loss translates in the erosion of $3-5$ meters of the\ncrust, consistently with the global survival of the basaltic crust of Vesta\nconfirmed by the Dawn mission. Our analysis revealed that the contribution of\nthe LHB to the cratering of Vesta' surface is not significant and is actually\nerased by the crater population produced by the following 4 Ga of collisional\nevolution of the asteroid, in agreement with the data provided by the Dawn\nmission.\n", "  We present new exact solutions describing motions of closed segmented strings\nin $AdS_3$ in terms of elliptic functions. The existence of analytic\nexpressions is due to the integrability of the classical equations of motion,\nwhich in our examples reduce to instances of the McMillan map. We also obtain a\ndiscrete evolution rule for the motion in $AdS_3$ of arbitrary bound states of\nfundamental strings and D1-branes in the test approximation.\n", "  Close binary central stars of planetary nebulae are key in constraining the\npoorly-understood common-envelope phase of evolution, which in turn is critical\nin understanding the formation of a wide-range of astrophysical phenomena\n(including cataclysmic variables, low-mass X-ray binaries and supernovae type\nIa). Here, I present the results of our on-going, targeted search for\nclose-binaries in planetary nebulae which has led to the discovery of more than\n10 new central binaries in just the last few years (almost the same as the\ntotal discovered during the 1980s and 1990s together). This success has been\nrooted in the targeted selection of objects for study, based on morphological\nfeatures deemed typical of binarity, as well as novel observing strategies\n(including the employment of narrow-band filters for photometry to minimise\nnebular contamination), both of which are discussed. These new discoveries,\ncoupled with the painstaking characterisation of both newly discovered systems\nand those from the literature, mean that we are now in a position to begin to\nprobe the physics of the common-envelope phase.\n", "  An approximate formula has been derived for gain fluctuations in cascaded\ngaseous detectors such as GEM-s, based on the assumption that the charge\ncollection, avalanche formation and extraction steps are independent cascaded\nprocesses. In order to test the approximation experimentally, a setup involving\na standard GEM layer has been constructed to measure the energy resolution for\n5.9 keV gamma particles. The formula reasonably traces both the charge\ncollection as well as the extraction process dependence of the energy\nresolution. Such analytic approximation for gain fluctuations can be applied to\nmulti-GEM detectors where it aids the interpretation of measurements as well as\nsimulations.\n", "  It has become increasingly feasible to use quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods\nto study correlated fermion systems for realistic Hamiltonians. We give a\nsummary of these techniques targeted at researchers in the field of correlated\nelectrons, focusing on the fundamentals, capabilities, and current status of\nthis technique. The QMC methods often offer the highest accuracy solutions\navailable for systems in the continuum, and, since they address the many-body\nproblem directly, the simulations can be analyzed to obtain insight into the\nnature of correlated quantum behavior.\n", "  We derive sufficient conditions for the memory kernel which guarantee\nlegitimate (completely positive and trace-preserving) dynamical map. It turns\nout that these conditions provide a natural parameterizations of the dynamical\nmap being a generalization of Markovian semigroup. It is shown that this class\nof maps cover almost all known examples -- from Markovian semigroup,\nsemi-Markov evolution up to collision models and their generalization.\n", "  Graphene on hexagonal boron-nitride (h-BN) is an atomically flat conducting\nsystem that is ideally suited for probing the effect of Zeeman splitting on\nelectron transport. We demonstrate by magneto-transport measurements that a\nparallel magnetic field up to 30 Tesla does not affect the transport properties\nof graphene on h-BN even at charge neutrality where such an effect is expected\nto be maximal. The only magnetoresistance detected at low carrier\nconcentrations is shown to be associated with a small perpendicular component\nof the field which cannot be fully eliminated in the experiment. Despite the\nhigh mobility of charge carries at low temperatures, we argue that the effects\nof Zeeman splitting are fully masked by electrostatic potential fluctuations at\ncharge neutrality.\n", "  A model describing nuclear collisions at intermediate energies is presented\nand the results are compared with recently measured double differential cross\nsections in C-C reactions at 95 MeV/nucleon. Results show the key role played\nby geometrical effects and the memory of the entrance channel, in particular\nthe momentum distributions of the two incoming nuclei. Special attention is\npaid to the description of processes occurring at mid-rapidity. To this end, a\nrandom particle production mechanism by means of a coalescence process in\nvelocity space is considered in the overlap region of the two interacting\nnuclei.\n", "  We consider the quasi-two-dimensional pseudo-spin-1/2 Kitaev - Heisenberg\nmodel proposed for A2IrO3 (A=Li, Na) compounds. The spin-wave excitation\nspectrum, the sublattice magnetization, and the transition temperatures are\ncalculated in the random phase approximation (RPA) for four different ordered\nphases, observed in the parameter space of the model: antiferomagnetic, stripe,\nferromagnetic, and zigzag phases. The N\\'{e}el temperature and temperature\ndependence of the sublattice magnetization are compared with the experimental\ndata on Na2IrO3.\n", "  The nested off-diagonal Bethe ansatz is generalized to study the quantum spin\nchain associated with the $SU_q(3)$ R-matrix and generic integrable\nnon-diagonal boundary conditions. By using the fusion technique, certain closed\noperator identities among the fused transfer matrices at the inhomogeneous\npoints are derived. The corresponding asymptotic behaviors of the transfer\nmatrices and their values at some special points are given in detail. Based on\nthe functional analysis, a nested inhomogeneous T-Q relations and Bethe ansatz\nequations of the system are obtained. These results can be naturally\ngeneralized to cases related to the $SU_q(n)$ algebra.\n", "  Loop-level scattering amplitudes for massless particles have singularities in\nregions where tree amplitudes are perfectly smooth. For example, a $2\\to4$\ngluon scattering process has a singularity in which each incoming gluon splits\ninto a pair of gluons, followed by a pair of $2\\to2$ collisions between the\ngluon pairs. This singularity mimics double parton scattering because it occurs\nwhen the transverse momentum of a pair of outgoing gluons vanishes. The\nsingularity is logarithmic at fixed order in perturbation theory. We exploit\nthe duality between scattering amplitudes and polygonal Wilson loops to study\nsix-point amplitudes in this limit to high loop order in planar ${\\cal N}=4$\nsuper-Yang-Mills theory. The singular configuration corresponds to the limit in\nwhich a hexagonal Wilson loop develops a self-crossing. The singular terms are\ngoverned by an evolution equation, in which the hexagon mixes into a pair of\nboxes; the mixing back is suppressed in the planar (large $N_c$) limit. Because\nthe kinematic dependence of the box Wilson loops is dictated by (dual)\nconformal invariance, the complete kinematic dependence of the singular terms\nfor the self-crossing hexagon on the one nonsingular variable is determined to\nall loop orders. The complete logarithmic dependence on the singular variable\ncan be obtained through nine loops, up to a couple of constants, using a\ncorrespondence with the multi-Regge limit. As a byproduct, we obtain a simple\nformula for the leading logs to all loop orders. We also show that, although\nthe MHV six-gluon amplitude is singular, remarkably, the transcendental\nfunctions entering the non-MHV amplitude are finite in the same limit, at least\nthrough four loops.\n", "  If decays of a heavy particle S are responsible for the diphoton excess with\ninvariant mass 750 GeV observed at the 13 TeV LHC run, it can be easily\naccomodated in the Standard Model. Two scenarios are considered: production in\ngluon fusion through a loop of heavy isosinglet quark(s) and production in\nphoton fusion through a loop of heavy isosinglet leptons. In the second case\nmany heavy leptons are needed or/and they should have large electric charges in\norder to reproduce experimental data on $\\sigma(pp \\to SX) \\cdot \\mathrm{Br}(S\n\\to \\gamma \\gamma)$.\n", "  We show that density-dependent velocity saturation in a GaN High Electron\nMobility Transistor (HEMT) can be related to the stimulated emission of\nlongitudinal optical (LO) phonons. As the drift velocity of electrons\nincreases, the drift of the Fermi distribution in reciprocal space produces\npopulation inversion and gain for the LO phonons. Once this gain reaches a\nthreshold value, the avalanche-like increase of LO emission causes a rapid loss\nof electron energy and momentum and leads to drift velocity saturation. Our\nsimple model correctly predicts both the general trend of the saturation\nvelocity decreasing with increasing electron density and the values of\nsaturation velocity measured in our experiments.\n", "  Large deviation functions are an essential tool in the statistics of rare\nevents. Often they can be obtained by contraction from a so-called level 2\nlarge deviation {\\em functional} characterizing the empirical density of the\nunderlying stochastic process. For Langevin systems obeying detailed balance,\nthe explicit form of this functional has been known ever since the mathematical\nwork of Donsker and Varadhan. We rederive the Donsker-Varadhan result by using\nstochastic path-integrals and then generalize it to situations without detailed\nbalance including non-equilibrium steady states. The proper incorporation of\nthe empirical probability flux turns out to be crucial. We elucidate the\nrelation between the large deviation functional and different notions of\nentropy production in stochastic thermodynamics and discuss some aspects of the\nensuing contractions. Finally, we illustrate our findings with examples.\n", "  The aim of this work is to study fiber derivatives associated to Lagrangian\nand Hamiltonian functions describing the dynamics of a higher-order autonomous\ndynamical system. More precisely, given a function in $T^*T^{(k-1)}Q$, we find\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for such a function to describe the\ndynamics of a kth-order autonomous dynamical system, thus being a kth-order\nHamiltonian function. Then, we give a suitable definition of (hyper)regularity\nfor these higher-order Hamiltonian functions in terms of their fiber\nderivative. In addition, we also study an alternative characterization of the\ndynamics in Lagrangian submanifolds in terms of the solutions of the\nhigher-order Euler-Lagrange equations.\n", "  Recent studies have unequivocally proven the existence of clouds in\nsuper-Earth atmospheres (Kreidberg et al. 2014). Here we provide a theoretical\ncontext for the formation of super-Earth clouds by determining which\ncondensates are likely to form under the assumption of chemical equilibrium. We\nstudy super-Earth atmospheres of diverse bulk composition, which are assumed to\nform by outgassing from a solid core of chondritic material, following Schaefer\n& Fegley (2010). The super-Earth atmospheres that we study arise from planetary\ncores made up of individual types of chondritic meteorites. They range from\nhighly reducing to oxidizing and have carbon to oxygen (C:O) ratios that are\nboth subsolar and super-solar, thereby spanning a range of atmospheric\ncomposition that is appropriate for low-mass exoplanets. Given the atomic\nmakeup of these atmospheres, we minimize the global Gibbs free energy of\nformation for over 550 gases and condensates to obtain the molecular\ncomposition of the atmospheres over a temperature range of 350-3,000 K. Clouds\nshould form along the temperature-pressure boundaries where the condensed\nspecies appear in our calculation. We find that the composition of condensate\nclouds depends strongly on both the H:O and C:O ratios. For the super-Earth\narchetype GJ 1214b, KCl and ZnS are the primary cloud-forming condensates at\nsolar composition, in agreement with previous work (Morley et al. 2013;\nMiller-Ricci Kempton et al. 2012). However, for oxidizing atmospheres, K2SO4\nand ZnO condensates are favored instead, and for carbon-rich atmospheres with\nsuper-solar C:O ratios, graphite clouds appear. For even hotter planets, clouds\nform from a wide variety of rock-forming and metallic species.\n", "  A four-terminal donor quantum dot (QD) is used to characterize potential\nbarriers between degenerately doped nanoscale contacts. The QD is fabricated by\nhydrogen-resist lithography on Si(001) in combination with $n$-type doping by\nphosphine. The four contacts have different separations ($d$ = 9, 12, 16 and 29\nnm) to the central 6 nm $\\times$ 6 nm QD island, leading to different tunnel\nand capacitive coupling. Cryogenic transport measurements in the\nCoulomb-blockade (CB) regime are used to characterize these tunnel barriers. We\nfind that field enhancement near the apex of narrow dopant leads is an\nimportant effect that influences both barrier breakdown and the magnitude of\nthe tunnel current in the CB transport regime. From CB-spectroscopy\nmeasurements, we extract the mutual capacitances between the QD and the four\ncontacts, which scale inversely with the contact separation $d$. The\ncapacitances are in excellent agreement with numerical values calculated from\nthe pattern geometry in the hydrogen resist. We show that by engineering the\nsource-drain tunnel barriers to be asymmetric, we obtain a much simpler\nexcited-state spectrum of the QD, which can be directly linked to the orbital\nsingle-particle spectrum.\n", "  ASASSN-14li is a recently-discovered tidal disruption event with an\nexceptionally rich data-set: spectra and lightcurves in soft X-rays, UV,\noptical, and radio. To understand its emission properties in all these bands,\nwe have extended our model for post-tidal disruption accretion and photon\nproduction to estimate both soft X-ray radiation produced by the prompt\naccretion phase and synchrotron emission associated with the bow shock driven\nthrough an external medium by the unbound tidal debris, as well as optical and\nUV light. We find that fiducial values of the stellar mass ($1 M_\\odot$) and\nblack hole mass ($10^{6.5} M_{\\odot}$) yield: quantitative agreement with the\noptical/UV luminosity, lightcurve, and color temperature; approximate agreement\nwith the somewhat uncertain soft X-ray spectrum and lightcurve; and\nquantitative agreement with the radio luminosity, spectrum and lightcurve.\nEquipartition analysis of the radio data implies that the radio-emitting region\nexpands with a constant speed, and its magnitude is comparable to the speed\nexpected for the unbound stellar ejecta. Both facts provide strong support to\nour model. We find that the disruption event took place in mid-September 2014.\nTwo independent parameters, the magnitude and logarithmic radial gradient of\nthe ambient gas density near the black hole, must be fit to the data to explain\nthe radio emission; their inferred values are comparable to those found near\nboth Sgr A* and the TDE candidate Swift J1644.\n", "  We demonstrate that irreversible structural reorganization is not necessary\nfor the observation of yield behaviour in an amorphous solid. While the\nmajority of solids strained to their yield point do indeed undergo an\nirreversible reorganization, we find a significant fraction of solids exhibit\nyield via a reversible strain. We also demonstrate that large instantaneous\nstrains in excess of the yield stress can result in complete stress relaxation,\na result of the large non-affine motions driven by the applied strain. The\nempirical similarity of the dependence of the ratio of stress over strain on\nthe non-affine mean squared displacement with that for the shear modulus\nobtained from quiescent liquid at non-zero temperature supports the proposition\nthat rigidity depends on the size of the sampled configurational space only,\nand is insensitive as to how this space is sampled.\n", "  We present an investigation of rapidly rotating (small Rossby number $Ro\\ll\n1$) and stratified turbulence where the stratification strength is varied from\nweak (large Froude number $Fr\\gg1$) to strong ($Fr\\ll1$). The investigation is\nset in the context of a reduced model derived from the Boussinesq equations\nthat efficiently retains anisotropic inertia-gravity waves with order-one\nfrequencies and highlights a regime of wave-eddy interactions. Numerical\nsimulations of the reduced model are performed where energy is injected by a\nstochastic forcing of vertical velocity, which forces wave modes only. The\nsimulations reveal two regimes characterized by the presence of well-formed,\npersistent and thin turbulent layers of locally-weakened stratification at\nsmall Froude numbers, and by the absence of layers at large Froude numbers.\nBoth regimes are characterized by a large-scale barotropic dipole enclosed by\nsmall-scale turbulence. When the Reynolds number is not too large a direct\ncascade of barotropic kinetic energy is observed, leading to total energy\nequilibration. We examine net energy exchanges that occur through vortex\nstretching and vertical buoyancy flux and diagnose the horizontal scales active\nin these exchanges. We find that the baroclinic motions inject energy directly\nto the largest scales of the barotropic mode, implying that the large-scale\nbarotropic dipole is not the end result of an inverse cascade within the\nbarotropic mode.\n", "  We present transport measurements on long diffusive graphene-based Josephson\njunctions. Several junctions are made on a single-domain crystal of CVD\ngraphene and feature the same contact width of ~9$\\mu$m but vary in length from\n400 to 1000 nm. As the carrier density is tuned with the gate voltage, the\ncritical current in the these junctions spans a range from a few nA up to more\nthan $5\\mu$A, while the Thouless energy, ETh, covers almost two orders of\nmagnitude. Over much of this range, the product of the critical current and the\nnormal resistance IcRn is found to scale linearly with ETh, as expected from\ntheory. However, the ratio IcRn /ETh is found to be 0.1-0.2: much smaller than\nthe predicted ~10 for long diffusive SNS junctions.\n", "  We show that surface plasmons of a two-dimensional Dirac metal such as\ngraphene can be reflected by line-like perturbations hosting one-dimensional\nelectron states. The reflection originates from a strong enhancement of the\nlocal optical conductivity caused by optical transitions involving these bound\nstates. We propose that the bound states can be systematically created,\ncontrolled, and liquidated by an ultranarrow electrostatic gate. Using infrared\nnanoimaging, we obtain experimental evidence for the locally enhanced\nconductivity of graphene induced by a carbon nanotube gate, which supports this\ntheoretical concept.\n", "  Sr$_2$CuWO$_6$ is a double perovskite proposed to be at the border between\ntwo and three dimensional magnetism, with a square lattice of $S=\\frac{1}{2}$\nCu$^{2+}$ ions. We have used inelastic neutron scattering to investigate the\nspin wave excitations of the system, to find out how they evolve as a function\nof temperature, as well as to obtain information about the magnetic exchange\ninteractions. We observed well defined dispersive spin wave modes at $6$~K,\nwhich partially survive above the magnetic ordering temperature, $T_N=24$~K.\nLinear spin wave theory is used to determine the exchange interactions\nrevealing them to be highly two-dimensional in nature. Density functional\ntheory calculations are presented supporting this experimental finding, which\nis in contrast to a previous \\emph{ab-initio} study of the magnetic\ninteractions. Our analysis confirms that not the nearest neighbour, but the\nnext nearest neighbour interactions in the tetragonal $ab$ plane are the\nstrongest. Low incident energy measurements reveal the opening of a\n$0.6(1)$~meV gap below $T_N$, which suggests the presence of a very weak single\nion anisotropy term in the form of an easy axis along $\\hat{\\mathbf{a}}$.\n", "  The particle wave duality sets a fundamental correspondence between optics\nand quantum mechanics. Within this framework, the propagation of quasiparticles\ncan give rise to superposition phenomena which, like for electromagnetic waves,\ncan be described by the Huygens principle. However, the utilization of this\nprinciple by means of propagation and manipulation of quantum information is\nlimited by the required coherence in time and space. Here we show that in\ntopological insulators, which in their pristine form are characterized by\nopposite propagation directions for the two quasiparticles spin channels,\nmesoscopic focusing of coherent charge density oscillations can be obtained at\nlarge nested segments of constant energy contours by magnetic surface doping.\nOur findings provide evidence of strongly anisotropic Dirac fermion-mediated\ninteractions. Even more remarkably, the validity of our findings goes beyond\ntopological insulators but applies for systems with spin orbit lifted\ndegeneracy in general. It demonstrates how spin information can be transmitted\nover long distances, allowing the design of experiments and devices based on\ncoherent quantum effects in this fascinating class of materials.\n", "  Giant eruptions or supernova-impostor events are far more mysterious than\ntrue supernovae. An extreme example can release as much radiative energy as a\nSN, ejecting several M_sun of material. These events involve continuous\nradiation-driven outflows rather than blast waves. They constitute one of the\nmain unsolved problems in stellar astrophysics, but have received surprisingly\nlittle theoretical effort. Here I note some aspects that are not yet familiar\nto most astronomers.\n", "  Stability of lubricating fluid infused slippery surfaces is a concern for\nscientists and engineers and attempts are being made for its improvement.\nLubricating oil coated slippery surface for aqueous drops is one of the\nimportant candidates in this class and their stability needs be improved to\nmake them useful for practical applications. Cloaking of water drops with thin\nlubricant layer results in the loss of lubricant leading to deterioration of\nslippery behavior. Surface roughness or porosity provides larger surface area\nto the lubricating fluid and would to affect the stability of the lubricating\nfilm. Here we report the effect of surface roughness, from tens of nanometer to\nfew microns, on the stability of slippery surface. Samples with small nanoscale\nroughness show improved performance in terms of contact angle hysteresis,\ncritical tilt angle and slip velocity. Whereas large roughness samples show\npoorer performance compared to small nanoscale roughness and smooth samples.\nSmall nanoscale roughness samples also show relatively slower deterioration\nagainst loss of lubricant during water flow. Once completely lost, the slippery\nbehavior can be restored again simply by coating the sample again by the\nlubricating fluid.\n", "  Inspired by the recent developments in the study of the thermodynamics of van\nder Waals fluids via the theory of nonlinear conservation laws and the\ndescription of phase transitions in terms of classical (dissipative) shock\nwaves, we propose a novel approach to the construction of multi-parameter\ngeneralisations of the van der Waals model. The theory of integrable nonlinear\nconservation laws still represents the inspiring framework. Starting from a\nmacroscopic approach, a four parameter family of integrable extended van der\nWaals models is indeed constructed in such a way that the equation of state is\na solution to an integrable nonlinear conservation law linearisable by a\nCole-Hopf transformation. This family is further specified by the request that,\nin regime of high temperature, far from the critical region, the extended model\nreproduces asymptotically the standard van der Waals equation of state. We\nprovide a detailed comparison of our extended model with two notable empirical\nmodels such as Peng-Robinson and Soave's modification of the Redlich-Kwong\nequations of state. We show that our extended van der Waals equation of state\nis compatible with both empirical models for a suitable choice of the free\nparameters and can be viewed as a master interpolating equation. The present\napproach also suggests that further generalisations can be obtained by\nincluding the class of dispersive and viscous-dispersive nonlinear conservation\nlaws and could lead to a new type of thermodynamic phase transitions associated\nto nonclassical and dispersive shock waves.\n", "  Using a sharp Gagliardo-Nirenberg type inequality, well-posedness issues of\nthe initial value problem for a fractional inhomogeneous Schrodinger equation\nare investigated.\n", "  The discoveries of GW 150914, GW 151226, and LVT 151012 suggest that double\nblack hole (BH-BH) mergers are common in the universe. If at least one of the\ntwo merging black holes carries certain amount of charge, possibly retained by\na rotating magnetosphere, the inspiral of a BH-BH system would drive a global\nmagnetic dipole normal to the orbital plane. The rapidly evolving magnetic\nmoment during the merging process would drive a Poynting flux with an\nincreasing wind power. The magnetospheric activities during the final phase of\nthe merger would make a fast radio burst (FRB) if the BH charge can be as large\nas a factor of $\\hat q \\sim (10^{-9}-10^{-8})$ of the critical charge $Q_c$ of\nthe BH. At large radii, dissipation of the Poynting flux energy in the outflow\nwould power a short duration high-energy transient, which would appear as a\ndetectable short-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) if the charge can be as large\nas $\\hat q \\sim (10^{-5}-10^{-4})$. The putative short GRB coincident with GW\n150914 recorded by Fermi GBM may be interpreted with this model. Future joint\nGW/GRB/FRB searches would lead to a measurement or place a constraint on the\ncharges carried by isolate black holes.\n", "  We propose some protocols to implement various classes of bipartite unitary\noperations on two remote parties with the help of repeater nodes in-between. We\nalso present a protocol to implement a single-qubit unitary with parameters\ndetermined by a remote party with the help of up to three repeater nodes. It is\nassumed that the neighboring nodes are connected by noisy photonic channels,\nand the local gates can be performed quite accurately, while the decoherence of\nmemories is significant. A unitary is often a part of a larger computation or\ncommunication task in a quantum network, and to reduce the amount of\ndecoherence in other systems of the network, we focus on the goal of saving the\ntotal time for implementing a unitary including the time for entanglement\npreparation. We review some previously studied protocols that implement\nbipartite unitaries using local operations and classical communication and\nprior shared entanglement, and apply them to the situation with repeater nodes\nwithout prior entanglement. We find that the protocols using piecewise\nentanglement between neighboring nodes often require less total time compared\nto preparing entanglement between the two end nodes first and then performing\nthe previously known protocols. For a generic bipartite unitary, as the number\nof repeater nodes increases, the total time could approach the time cost for\ndirect signal transfer from one end node to the other. We also prove some lower\nbounds of the total time when there are a small number of repeater nodes. The\napplication to position-based cryptography is discussed.\n", "  Precision measurements of the Drell-Yan (DY) cross section at the LHC\nconstrain new physics scenarios that involve new states with electroweak (EW)\ncharges. We analyze these constraints and apply them to models that can address\nthe LHC diphoton excess at 750 GeV. We confront these findings with LEP EW\nprecision tests and show that DY provides stronger constraints than the LEP\ndata. While 8 TeV data can already probe some parts of the interesting region\nof parameter space, LHC14 results are expected to cover a substantial part of\nthe relevant terrain. We derive the bounds from the existing data, estimate\nLHC14 reach and compare them to the bounds one gets from LEP and future FCC-ee\nprecision measurements.\n", "  The aims of this letter are three-fold: First is to show that nonlinear\ngeneralizations of electrodynamics support various types of knotted solutions\nin vacuum. The solutions are universal in the sense that they do not depend on\nthe specific Lagrangian density, at least if the latter gives rise to a\nwell-posed theory. Second is to describe the interaction between probe waves\nand knotted background configurations. We show that the qualitative behaviour\nof this interaction may be described in terms of Robinson congruences, which\nappear explicitly in the causal structure of the theory. Finally, we argue that\noptical arrangements endowed with intense background fields could be the\nnatural place to look for the knots experimentally.\n", "  Many galaxies are expected to harbor binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs)\nin their centers. Their interaction with the surrounding gas results in\naccretion and exchange of angular momentum via tidal torques, facilitating\nbinary inspiral. Here we explore the non-trivial coupling between these two\nprocesses and analyze how the global properties of externally supplied\ncircumbinary disks depend on the binary accretion rate. By formulating our\nresults in terms of the angular momentum flux driven by internal stresses, we\ncome up with a very simple classification of the possible global disk\nstructures, which differ from the standard constant $\\dot M$ accretion disk\nsolution. Suppression of accretion by the binary tides, leading to a\nsignificant mass accumulation in the inner disk, accelerates binary inspiral.\nWe show that once the disk region strongly perturbed by the viscously\ntransmitted tidal torque exceeds the binary semi-major axis, the binary can\nmerge in less than its mass-doubling time due to accretion. Thus, unlike the\ninspirals driven by stellar scattering, the gas-assisted merger can occur even\nif the binary is embedded in a relatively low mass disk (lower than its own\nmass). This is important for resolving the \"last parsec\" problem for SMBH\nbinaries and understanding powerful gravitational wave sources in the Universe.\nWe argue that the enhancement of accretion by the binary found in some recent\nsimulations cannot persist for a long time and should not affect the long-term\norbital inspiral. We also review the existing simulations of the SMBH\nbinary-disk coupling and propose a numerical setup, which is particularly well\nsuited for verifying our theoretical predictions.\n", "  If design principles for controlling quantum interference in single molecules\ncould be elucidated and verified, then this will lay the foundations for\nexploiting such effects in nanoscale devices and thin-film materials.When the\ncore of a graphene-like polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) is weakly coupled to\nexternal electrodes by atoms i and j, the single-molecule electrical\nconductance sigma-ij depends on the choice of connecting atoms i,j.\nFurthermore, conductance ratios sigma-ij/sigma-lm corresponding to different\nconnectivities i,j and l,m are determined by quantum interference within the\nPAH core. In this paper, we examine how such conductance ratios change when one\nof the carbon atoms within the \"parent\" PAH core is replaced by a heteroatom to\nyield a \"daughter\" molecule. For bipartite parental cores, in which\nodd-numbered sites are connected to even-numbered sites only, the effect of\nheteroatom substitution onto an odd-numbered site is summarized by the\nfollowing qualitative rules:\n  (a) When i and j are odd, both parent and daughter have low conductances (b)\nWhen i is odd and j is even, or vice versa both parent and daughter have high\nconductances (c) When i,j are both even, the parent has a low conductance and\nthe daughter a high conductance. These rules are verified by comparison with\ndensity-functional calculations on naphthalene, anthracene, pyrene and\nanthanthrene cores connected via two different anchor groups to gold\nelectrodes.\n", "  In this paper we derive, by means of a suitable least action principle, the\nduality jump conditions to be imposed at surfaces of discontinuity of the\nmaterial properties in non-dissipative, linear-elastic, isotropic, Mindlin's\nand relaxed micromorphic media, respectively. The introduced theoretical\nframework allows the transparent set-up of different types of micro-macro\nconnections which are intrinsically compatible with the governing bulk\nequations. To illustrate the interest of the many introduced jump conditions,\nwe focus on the case of an interface between a classical Cauchy continuum on\none side and a relaxed micromorphic one on the other side. As expected, we find\na complete reflection in the frequency intervals for which band-gaps are known\nto occur in the relaxed micromorphic continuum and precise\nmicrostructure-related reflective patterns are identified. We repeat a similar\nstudy for analogous connections between a classical Cauchy continuum and a\nMindlin's micromorphic one and we show that the reflective properties of the\nconsidered interfaces are drastically modified due to the fact that band-gaps\nare not allowed in standard Mindlin's micromorphic media. The present work\nopens the way towards the possibility of conceiving complex metastructures in\nwhich band-gap metamaterials and classical materials are coupled together to\nproduce structures with completely new and unorthodox properties with respect\nto wave propagation, transmission and reflection. Last, but not least, indirect\nmeasurements of the material coefficients of the relaxed micromorphic model\nbased upon real experiments of reflection and transmission in band-gap\nmetamaterials are uncovered by the present work which makes them finally\nrealizable in the short term.\n", "  We optimize the first and second intrinsic hyperpolarizabilities for a 1D\npiecewise linear potential dressed with Dirac delta functions for $N$\nnon-interacting electrons. The optimized values fall rapidly for $N>1$, but\napproach constant values of $\\beta_{int}=0.40$, $\\gamma_{int}^{+}=0.16$ and\n$\\gamma_{int}^{-}=-0.061$ above $N\\gtrsim8$. These apparent bounds are achieved\nwith only 2 parameters with more general potentials achieving no better value.\nIn contrast to previous studies, analysis of the hessian matrices of\n$\\beta_{int}$ and $\\gamma_{int}$ taken with respect to these parameters shows\nthat the eigenvectors are well aligned with the basis vectors of the parameter\nspace, indicating that the parametrization was well-chosen. The physical\nsignificance of the important parameters is also discussed.\n", "  The Drell-Yan di-lepton production at hadron colliders is by far the\npreferred channel to search for new heavy spin-1 particles. Traditionally, such\nsearches have exploited the Narrow Width Approximation (NWA) for the signal,\nthereby neglecting the effect of the interference between the additional\nZ'-bosons and the Standard Model Z and {\\gamma}. Recently, it has been\nestablished that both finite width and interference effects can be dealt with\nin experimental searches while still retaining the model independent approach\nensured by the NWA. This assessment has been made for the case of popular\nsingle Z'-boson models currently probed at the CERN Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC). In this paper, we test the scope of the CERN machine in relation to the\nabove issues for some benchmark multi Z'-boson models. In particular, we\nconsider Non-Universal Extra Dimensional (NUED) scenarios and the 4-Dimensional\nComposite Higgs Model (4DCHM), both predicting a multi-Z' peaking structure. We\nconclude that in a variety of cases, specifically those in which the leptonic\ndecays modes of one or more of the heavy neutral gauge bosons are suppressed\nand/or significant interference effects exist between these or with the\nbackground, especially present when their decay widths are significant,\ntraditional search approaches based on the assumption of rather narrow and\nisolated objects might require suitable modifications to extract the underlying\ndynamics.\n", "  We investigate confinement-induced resonances in a system composed by a\ntightly trapped ion and a moving atom in a waveguide. We determine the\nconditions for the appearance of such resonances in a broad region -- from the\n\"long-wavelength\" limit to the opposite case when the typical length scale of\nthe atom-ion polarisation potential essentially exceeds the transverse\nwaveguide width. We find considerable dependence of the resonance position on\nthe atomic mass which, however, disappears in the \"long-wavelength and\nzero-energy\" limit, where the known result for the confined atom-atom\nscattering is reproduced. We also derive an analytic and a semi-analytic\nformula for the resonance position in the \"long-wavelength and zero-energy\"\nlimit and we investigate numerically how the position of the resonance is\naffected by a finite atomic colliding energy. Our results, which can be\ninvestigated experimentally in the near future, could be used to determine the\natom-ion scattering length, the temperature of the atomic ensemble in the\npresence of an ion impurity, and to control the atom-phonon coupling in a\nlinear ion crystal in interaction with a quasi one dimensional atomic quantum\ngas.\n", "  $^1$H nuclear spin-lattice relaxation and Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP)\nhave been studied in amorphous samples of trehalose sugar doped with TEMPO\nradicals by means of mechanical milling, in the 1.6 K $\\div$ 4.2 K temperature\nrange. The radical concentration was varied between 0.34 and 0.81 $\\%$. The\nhighest polarization of 15 \\% at 1.6 K, observed in the sample with\nconcentration $0.50 \\%$, is of the same order of magnitude of that reported in\nstandard frozen solutions with TEMPO. The temperature and concentration\ndependence of the spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_{\\text{1}}$, dominated by\nthe coupling with the electron spins, were found to follow power laws with an\nexponent close to $3$ in all samples. The observed proportionality between\n$1/T_{\\text{1}}$ and the polarization rate $1/T_{\\text{pol}}$, with a\ncoefficient related to the electron polarization, is consistent with the\npresence of Thermal Mixing (TM) and a good contact between the nuclear and the\nelectron spins. At high electron concentration additional relaxation channels\ncausing a decrease in the nuclear polarization must be considered. These\nresults provide further support for a more extensive use of amorphous DNP-ready\nsamples, obtained by means of comilling, in dissolution DNP experiments and\npossibly for $\\textit{in vivo}$ metabolic imaging.\n", "  Mack has conjectured that all conformal field theories are equivalent to\nstring theories. We explore the example of the two-dimensional minimal model\nCFTs and confirm that the Mellin transformed amplitudes have the desired\nproperties of string theory in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime.\n", "  We propose a new three-dimensional map that demonstrates the two- and\nthree-frequency quasi-periodicity. For this map all basic quasi-periodic\nbifurcations are possible. The study was realized by using method of Lyapunov\ncharts completed by plots of Lyapunov exponents, phase portraits and\nbifurcation trees illustrating the quasi-periodic bifurcations. The features of\nthe three-parameter structure associated with quasi-periodic Hopf bifurcation\nare discussed. The comparison with non-autonomous model is carried out.\n", "  We investigate the origin of the orbital ordering in the paramagnetic phase\nof KCrF$_3$. All previous studies described structural parameters of the\nparamagnetic phase using a magnetic ordering in the compound. Our simulations\nof real paramagnetic KCrF$_3$ were performed within an approach combining\ndensity functional theory and dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT). As a\nresult, it was found that the experimentally observed cooperative Jahn-Teller\neffect is successfully described in a lattice relaxation calculation for\nstructure without any long-range magnetic ordering. It is established that the\nexistence of the orbital ordering even in undistorted perovskite structure\nclearly confirms the electronic origin of the orbital ordering in KCrF$_3$.\n", "  The $^9$Be$(\\gamma,n)^8$Be reaction is enhanced by a near threshold $1/2^+$\nstate. Contradictions between existing measurements of this reaction\ncross-section affect calculations of astrophysical r-process yields, dark\nmatter detector calibrations, and the theory of the nuclear structure of\n$^9$Be. Select well-documented radioisotope $^9$Be$(\\gamma,n)$ source yield\nmeasurements have been reanalyzed, providing a set of high-accuracy\nindependently measured cross sections. A Breit-Wigner fit of these corrected\nmeasurements yields $E_R=1738.8\\pm1.9$ keV, $\\Gamma_\\gamma=0.771\\pm0.021$ eV,\nand $\\Gamma_n=268\\pm15$ keV for the $1/2^+$ state. A virtual $1/2^+$ state is\nexcluded with 99.3\\% confidence.\n", "  Two-photon lasers require materials with large two-photon gain (2PG)\ncoefficients and low linear and nonlinear losses. Our previous demonstration of\nlarge enhancement of two-photon absorption in semiconductors for very different\nphoton energies translates directly into enhancement of 2PG. We experimentally\ndemonstrate nondegenerate 2PG in optically excited bulk GaAs via femtosecond\npump-probe measurements. 2PG is isolated from other pump induced effects\nthrough the difference between measurements performed with parallel and\nperpendicular polarizations of pump and probe. An enhancement in the 2PG\ncoefficient of nearly two orders-of-magnitude is reported. The results point a\npossible way toward two-photon semiconductor lasers.\n", "  We consider a particle moving with equation of motion $\\dot x=f(t)$, where\n$f(t)$ is a random function with statistics which are independent of $x$ and\n$t$, with a finite drift velocity $v=\\langle f\\rangle$ and in the presence of a\nreflecting wall. Far away from the wall, translational invariance implies that\nthe stationary probability distribution is $P(x)\\sim \\exp(\\alpha x)$. A\nclassical example of a problem of this type is sedimentation equilibrium, where\n$\\alpha$ is determined by temperature. In this work we do not introduce a\nthermal reservoir and $\\alpha$ is determined from the equation of motion. We\nconsider a general approach to determining $\\alpha$ which is not always in\nagreement with Einstein's relation between the mean velocity and the diffusion\ncoefficient. We illustrate our results with a model inspired by the Boltzmann\nequation.\n", "  We report the complex dielectric function along and perpendicular to the IrO2\nplanes in the layered perovskite Sr2IrO4 determined by spectroscopic\nellipsometry in the spectral range from 12 meV to 6 eV. Thin high quality\nsingle crystals were stacked to measure the c-axis optical conductivity. In the\nphonon response we identified 10 infrared-active modes polarized within the\nbasal plane and only four modes polarized along the c-axis, in full agreement\nwith first-principle lattice dynamics calculations. We also observed a strong\noptical anisotropy in the near-infrared spectra arising from direct transitions\nbetween Ir 5d t2g Jeff = 1/2 and Jeff = 3/2 bands, which transition probability\nis highly suppressed for light polarized along the c-axis. The spectra are\nanalyzed and discussed in terms of relativistic LSDA+U band structure\ncalculations.\n", "  String theory axions are interesting candidates for fields whose potential\nmight be controllable over super-Planckian field ranges and therefore as\npossible candidates for inflatons in large field inflation. Axion monodromy\nscenarios are setups where the axion shift symmetry is broken by some effect\nsuch that the axion can traverse a large number of periods potentially leading\nto super-Planckian excursions. We study such scenarios in type IIA string\ntheory where the axion shift symmetry is broken by background fluxes. In\nparticular we calculate the backreaction of the energy density induced by the\naxion vacuum expectation value on its own field space metric. We find universal\nbehaviour for all the compactifications studied where up to a certain critical\naxion value there is only a small backreaction effect. Beyond the critical\nvalue the backreaction is strong and implies that the proper field distance as\nmeasured by the backreacted metric increases at best logarithmically with the\naxion vev, thereby placing strong limitations on extending the field distance\nany further. The critical axion value can be made arbitrarily large by the\nchoice of fluxes. However the backreaction of these fluxes on the axion field\nspace metric ensures a precise cancellation such that the proper field distance\nup to the critical axion value is flux independent and remains sub-Planckian.\nWe also study an axion alignment scenario for type IIA compactifications on a\ntwisted torus with four fundamental axions mixing to leave an axion with an\neffective decay constant which is flux dependent. There is a choice of fluxes\nfor which the alignment parameter is unconstrained by tadpoles and can in\nprinciple lead to a parametrically enhanced effective decay constant. However\nwe show that these fluxes backreact on the fundamental decay constants so as to\nprecisely cancel any enhancement.\n", "  Studies of electronic interferometers, based on edge channel transport in the\nquantum Hall effect regime, have been stimulated by the search for evidence of\nabelian and non-abelian anyonic statistics of fractional charges.These studies\nfound the ubiquitous electronic Fabry-Perot interferometer to be Coulomb\ndominated, thus masking coherent Aharonov-Bohm interference. Typically, the\nmain signature of the Coulomb dominated regime is the lack of interference of\nthe outer most edge channel as the magnetic field is varied. This seemingly\nsurprising behavior is explained by the shrinkage of the interference area with\nincreasing magnetic field, thus keeping the number of electrons and the\nenclosed flux constant. The model further stipulates, but with no experimental\nevidence thus far, that once the area shrinks by a size corresponding to an\nentire flux-quantum, it abruptly inflates to its original size leading to an\nunobservable 2{\\pi} phase jump. Here we report on the observation of such area\nbreathing by performing a partial screening of the Coulomb interactions. The\nnovelty is that the variation of the phase induced by the external knobs is not\nfully cancelled by the area response. We infer the area variations (with a\nresolution on the order of ~50 nm$^{2}$) from conductance measurements. The\nlatter are sensitive to the continuous phase variations, and reveal abrupt\nphase-jumps (smaller than 2{\\pi}). Based on our results, we propose a new\nexperimental tool for probing anyonic statistics.\n", "  We investigate the reaction $\\pi^- p \\to \\pi^- J/\\psi p$ via the open-charm\nhadron rescattering diagrams. Due to the presence of the triangle singularity\n(TS) in the rescattering amplitudes, the TS peaks can simulate the\npentaquark-like resonances arising in the $J/\\psi p$ invariant mass\ndistributions, which may bring ambiguities on our understanding of the nature\nof the exotic states. Searching for the heavy pentaquark in different processes\nmay help us to clarify the ambiguities, because of the highly process-dependent\ncharacteristic of the TS mechanism.\n", "  In the current epoch, one of the main mechanisms driving the growth of galaxy\nclusters is the continuous accretion of group-scale halos. In this process, the\nram pressure applied by the hot intracluster medium on the gas content of the\ninfalling group is responsible for stripping the gas from its dark-matter halo,\nwhich gradually leads to the virialization of the infalling gas in the\npotential well of the main cluster. Using deep wide-field observations of the\npoor cluster Hydra A/A780 with XMM-Newton and Suzaku, we report the discovery\nof an infalling galaxy group 1.1 Mpc south of the cluster core. The presence of\na substructure is confirmed by a dynamical study of the galaxies in this\nregion. A wake of stripped gas is trailing behind the group over a projected\nscale of 760 kpc. The temperature of the gas along the wake is constant at kT ~\n1.3 keV, which is about a factor of two less than the temperature of the\nsurrounding plasma. We observe a cold front pointing westwards compared to the\npeak of the group, which indicates that the group is currently not moving in\nthe direction of the main cluster, but is moving along an almost circular\norbit. The overall morphology of the group bears remarkable similarities with\nhigh-resolution numerical simulations of such structures, which greatly\nstrengthens our understanding of the ram-pressure stripping process.\n", "  In any gravitational theory and in a wide class of background space-times, we\nargue that there exists a simple, yet profound, relation between the on-shell\nEuclidean gravitational action and the on-shell Euclidean action of probes. The\nprobes can be, for instance, charged particles or branes. The relation is\ntightly related to the thermodynamic nature of gravity. We provide precise\nchecks of the relation in several examples, which include both asymptotically\nflat and asymptotically AdS space-times, with particle, D-brane and M-brane\nprobes. Perfect consistency is found in all cases, including in a highly\nnon-trivial example including \\alpha'-corrections.\n", "  The knowledge of thermal radiative and thermodynamic properties of uranium\nand plutonium carbides under extreme conditions is essential for designing a\nnew metallic fuel materials for next generation of a nuclear reactor. The\npresent work is devoted to the study of the thermal radiative and thermodynamic\nproperties of liquid and solid uranium and plutonium carbides at their\nmelting/freezing temperatures. The Stefan-Boltzmann law, total energy density,\nnumber density of photons, Helmholtz free energy density, internal energy\ndensity, enthalpy density, entropy density, heat capacity at constant volume,\npressure, and normal total emissivity are calculated using experimental data\nfor the frequency dependence of the normal spectral emissivity of liquid and\nsolid uranium and plutonium carbides in the visible-near infrared range. It is\nshown that the thermal radiative and thermodynamic functions of uranium carbide\nhave a slight difference during liquid-to-solid transition. Unlike UC, such a\ndifference between these functions have not been established for plutonium\ncarbide. The calculated values for the normal total emissivity of uranium and\nplutonium carbides at their melting temperatures is in good agreement with\nexperimental data. The obtained results allow to calculate the thermal\nradiative and thermodynamic properties of liquid and solid uranium and\nplutonium carbides for any size of samples. Based on the model of Hagen-Rubens\nand the Wiedemann-Franz law, a new method to determine the thermal conductivity\nof metals and carbides at the melting points is proposed.\n", "  The phase diagram of the $\\mathbb{Z}(5)$ spin model is studied numerically on\nthe square lattice by means of the {\\sl Density Matrix Renormalization Group}.\nIn the regime where the two nearest-neighbor couplings have opposite signs, a\ncritical phase, not observed in earlier Monte Carlo simulations, is identified.\nThe new phase diagram is in agreement with predictions made by M. den Nijs\n[{\\sl Phys. Rev. B} {\\bf 31}, 266 (1985)] but for the $\\mathbb{Z}(7)$ model\nrather than the $\\mathbb{Z}(5)$ one. All critical phases are shown to be\ncompatible with a central charge $c=1$. The magnetization scaling dimension\ndisplays however a different behavior in the different critical phases.\n", "  We demonstrate for a passive optical cavity containing a dispersive atomic\nmedium, the increase in scale factor near the critical anomalous dispersion is\nnot cancelled by mode broadening or attenuation, resulting in an overall\nincrease in the predicted quantum-noise-limited sensitivity. Enhancements of\nover two orders of magnitude are measured in the scale factor, which translates\nto greater than an order-of-magnitude enhancement in the predicted\nquantum-noise-limited measurement precision, by temperature tuning a\nlow-pressure vapor of non-interacting atoms in a low-finesse cavity close to\nthe critical anomalous dispersion condition. The predicted enhancement in\nsensitivity is confirmed through Monte-Carlo numerical simulations.\n", "  The wakefield and stopping power of an ion-beam pulse moving in magnetized\nplasmas are investigated by particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. The effects of\nbeam velocity and density on the wake and stopping power are discussed. In the\npresence of magnetic field, it is found that beside the longitudinal conversed\nV-shaped wakes, the strong whistler wave are observed when low-density and\nlow-velocity pulses moving in plasmas. The corresponding stopping powers are\nenhanced due to the drag of these whistler waves. As beam velocities increase,\nthe whistler waves disappear, and only are conversed V-shape wakes observed.\nThe corresponding stopping powers are reduced compared with these in isotropic\nplasmas. When high-density pulses transport in the magnetized plasmas, the\nwhistler waves are greatly inhibited for low-velocity pulses and disappear for\nhigh-velocity pulses. Additionally, the magnetic field reduces the stopping\npowers for all high-density cases.\n", "  In rarefied gases, mass and heat transport processes interfere with each\nother, leading to the mechano-caloric effect and thermo-osmotic effect, which\nare of interest to both theoretical study and practical applications. We employ\nthe unified gas-kinetic scheme to investigate these cross coupling effects in\ngas flows in micro-channels. Our numerical simulations cover channels of planar\nsurfaces and also channels of ratchet surfaces, with Onsager's reciprocal\nrelation verified for both cases. For channels of planar surfaces, simulations\nare performed in a wide range of Knudsen number and our numerical results show\ngood agreement with the literature results. For channels of ratchet surfaces,\nsimulations are performed for both the slip and transition regimes and our\nnumerical results not only confirm the theoretical prediction [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n107, 164502 (2011)] for Knudsen number in the slip regime but also show that\nthe off-diagonal kinetic coefficients for cross coupling effects are maximized\nat a Knudsen number in the transition regime. Finally, a preliminary\noptimization study is carried out for the geometry of Knudsen pump based on\nchannels of ratchet surfaces.\n", "  We study non-local effects associated with particle collisions in dense\nsuspension flows, in the context of the affine solvent model known to capture\nvarious aspects of the jamming transition. We show that an individual collision\nchanges significantly the velocity field on a characteristic volume\n$\\Omega_c\\sim 1/\\delta z$ that diverges as jamming is approached, where $\\delta\nz$ is the deficit in coordination number required to jam the system. Such an\nevent also affects the contact forces between particles on that same volume\n$\\Omega_c$, but this change is modest in relative terms, of order $f_{coll}\\sim\n\\bar{f}^{0.8}$, where $\\bar{f}$ is the typical contact force scale. We then\nshow that the requirement that coordination is stationary (such that a\ncollision has a finite probability to open one contact elsewhere in the system)\nyields the scaling of the viscosity (or equivalently the viscous number) with\ncoordination deficit $\\delta z$. The same scaling result was derived in\n[E.~DeGiuli, G.~D\\\"uring, E.~Lerner, and M.~Wyart, Phys.~Rev.~E {\\bf 91},\n062206 (2015)] via different arguments making an additional assumption. The\npresent approach gives a mechanistic justification as to why the correct finite\nsize scaling volume behaves as $1/\\delta z$, and can be used to recover a\nmarginality condition known to characterize the distributions of contact forces\nand gaps in jammed packings.\n", "  The Hohenberg-Kohn density functional was long ago shown to reduce to the\nThomas-Fermi approximation in the non-relativistic semiclassical (or large-$Z$)\nlimit for all matter, i.e, the kinetic energy becomes local. Exchange also\nbecomes local in this limit. Numerical data on the correlation energy of atoms\nsupports the conjecture that this is also true for correlation, but much less\nrelevant to atoms. We illustrate how expansions around large particle number\nare equivalent to local density approximations and their strong relevance to\ndensity functional approximations. Analyzing highly accurate atomic correlation\nenergies, we show that the correlation energy tends to $-A_c Z ln Z + B_c Z$ as\n$Z$ tends to infinity, where $Z$ is the atomic number, $A_c$ is known, and we\nestimate $B_c$ to be about 37 millihartrees. The local density approximation\nyields $A_c$ exactly, but a very incorrect value for $B_c$, showing that the\nlocal approximation is less relevant for correlation alone. This limit is a\nbenchmark for the non-empirical construction of density functional\napproximations. We conjecture that, beyond atoms, the leading correction to the\nlocal density approximation in the large-$Z$ limit generally takes this form,\nbut with $B_c$ a functional of the TF density for the system. The implications\nfor construction of approximate density functionals are discussed.\n", "  Understanding the sediment transport in oscillatory flows is essential to the\ninvestigation of the overall sediment budget for coastal regions. This overall\nbudget is crucial for the prediction of the morphological change of coastline\nin engineering applications. Since the sediment transport in oscillatory flows\nis dense particle-laden flow, appropriate modeling of the particle interaction\nis critical. Although traditional two-fluid approaches have been applied to the\nstudy of sediment transport in oscillatory flows, the approaches do not resolve\nthe interaction of the particles. Particle-resolved modeling of sediment\ntransport in oscillatory flows and the study of micromechanics of sediment\nparticles are still lacking. In this work, a parallel CFD-DEM solver that can\nresolve the inter-particle collision is applied to study the granular\nmicromechanics of sediment particles in oscillatory flows. The results obtained\nfrom the CFD-DEM solver are validated by using the experimental data of coarse\nand medium sands. The comparison with experimental results suggests that the\nflow velocity, the sediment flux and the net sediment transport rate predicted\nby are satisfactory. Moreover, the micromechanic quantities of the sediment bed\nare presented in detail, including Voronoi concentration, coordination number,\nand particle interaction force. It is demonstrated that variation of these\nmicromechanic quantities at different phases in the oscillatory cycle is\nsignificant, which is due to different responses of the sediment bed. To\ninvestigate the structural properties of the sediment bed, the correlation of\nthe Voronoi volume fraction and coordination number are compared to the results\nfrom the fluidized bed simulations. The consistency in the comparison indicates\nthe structural micromechanics of sediment transport and fluidized bed are\nsimilar despite the differences in flow patterns.\n", "  The properties of the Lambda(1405) resonance are key ingredients for\ndetermining the antikaon-nucleon interaction in strangeness nuclear physics,\nand the novel internal structure of the Lambda(1405) is of great interest in\nhadron physics, as a prototype case of a baryon that does not fit into the\nsimple three-quark picture. We show that a quantitative description of the\nantikaon-nucleon interaction with the Lambda(1405) is achieved in the framework\nof chiral SU(3) dynamics, with the help of recent experimental progress.\nFurther constraints on the Kbar N subthreshold interaction are provided by\nanalyzing pi Sigma spectra in various processes, such as the K-d -> pi Sigma n\nreaction and the Lambda_c -> pi pi Sigma decay. The structure of the\nLambda(1405) is found to be dominated by an antikaon-nucleon molecular\nconfiguration, based on its wavefunction derived from a realistic Kbar N\npotential and the compositeness criteria from a model-independent weak-binding\nrelation.\n", "  The wholeness, conceived and developed by Christopher Alexander, is what\nexists to some degree or other in space and matter, and can be described by\nprecise mathematical language. However, it remains somehow mysterious and\nelusive, and therefore hard to grasp. This paper develops a complex network\nperspective on the wholeness to better understand the nature of order or beauty\nfor sustainable design. I bring together a set of complexity-science subjects\nsuch as complex networks, fractal geometry, and in particular underlying\nscaling hierarchy derived by head/tail breaks - a classification scheme and a\nvisualization tool for data with a heavy-tailed distribution, in order to make\nAlexander's profound thoughts more accessible to design practitioners and\ncomplexity-science researchers. Through several case studies (some of which\nAlexander studied), I demonstrate that the complex-network perspective helps\nreduce the mystery of wholeness and brings new insights to Alexander's thoughts\non the concept of wholeness or objective beauty that exists in fine and deep\nstructure. The complex-network perspective enables us to see things in their\nwholeness, and to better understand how the kind of structural beauty emerges\nfrom local actions guided by the 15 fundamental properties, and by\ndifferentiation and adaptation processes. The wholeness goes beyond current\ncomplex network theory towards design or creation of living structures.\n  Keywords: Theory of centers, living geometry, Christopher Alexander,\nhead/tail breaks, and beauty\n", "  We study Lorentzian eternal black holes in the Chern-Simons sector of AdS$_3$\nhigher spin gravity. We probe such black holes using bulk Wilson lines and\nmotivate new regularity conditions that must be obeyed by the bulk connections\nin order for the geometry to be consistent with an interpretation as a\nthermofield state in the dual CFT$_2$. We demonstrate that any higher spin\nblack hole may be placed in a gauge that satisfies these conditions: this is\nthe Chern-Simons analogue of the construction of Kruskal coordinates that\npermit passage through the black hole horizon. We also argue that the Wilson\nline provides a higher-spin notion of causality in higher spin gravity that can\nbe used to associate a Penrose diagram with the black hole. We present some\napplications of the formalism, including a study of the time-dependent\nentanglement entropy arising from the higher spin black hole interior and\nevidence for an emergent AdS$_2$ region in the extremal limit.\n", "  We generalize calculations of the energy-momentum tensor for classical gluon\nfields in the McLerran-Venugopalan model using the small-$\\tau$ power series\nexpansion method. Results to all orders for the energy density and pressures\nare given in the leading $Q^2$ approximation and with the inclusion of running\ncoupling effects. The energy density and transverse pressure decrease\nmonotonically with time while the longitudinal pressure starts from a negative\nvalue and increases towards zero.\n", "  T-branes are exotic bound states of D-branes, characterized by mutually\nnon-commuting vacuum expectation values for the worldvolume scalars. The\nM/F-theory geometry lifting D6/D7-brane configurations is blind to the T-brane\ndata. In this paper, we make this data manifest, by probing the geometry with\nan M2-brane. We find that the effect of a T-brane is to deform the membrane\nworldvolume superpotential with monopole operators, which partially break the\nthree-dimensional flavor symmetry, and reduce supersymmetry from N=4 to N=2.\nOur main tool is 3d mirror symmetry. Through this language, a very concrete\nframework is developed for understanding T-branes in M-theory. This leads us to\nuncover a new class of N=2 quiver gauge theories, whose Higgs branches mimic\nthose of membranes at ADE singularities, but whose Coulomb branches differ from\ntheir N=4 counterparts.\n", "  A fitting model is developed for accounting the asymmetric ambipolarities in\nthe I-V characteristics of graphene field-effect transistors (G-FETs) with\ndoped channels, originating from the thermionic emission and interband\ntunneling at the junctions between the gated and access regions. Using the\nmodel, the gate-voltage-dependent intrinsic mobility as well as other intrinsic\nand extrinsic device parameters can be extracted. We apply it to a top-gated\nG-FET with a graphene channel grown on a SiC substrate and with SiN gate\ndielectric that we reported previously, and we demonstrate that it can\nexcellently fit its asymmetric I-V characteristic.\n", "  We consider one-dimensional propagation of quantum light in the presence of a\nblock of material, with a full account of dispersion and absorption. The\nelectromagnetic zero-point energy for some frequencies is damped (suppressed)\nby the block below the free-space value, while for other frequencies it is\nincreased. We also calculate the regularized (Casimir) zero-point energy at\neach frequency and find that it too is damped below the free-space value (zero)\nfor some frequencies. The total Casimir energy is positive.\n", "  We compute the next-to-leading order virtual QCD corrections to Higgs pair\nproduction via gluon fusion. We present analytic results for the two-loop\ncontributions to the spin-0 and spin-2 form factors in the amplitude. The\nreducible contributions, given by the double-triangle diagrams, are evaluated\nexactly while the two-loop irreducible diagrams are evaluated by an asymptotic\nexpansion in heavy top quark mass up to and including terms of\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/m_t^8)$. Assuming that the finite top-quark mass effects are of\nsimilar size in the entire range of partonic energies we estimate that mass\neffects can reduce the hadronic cross section by at most $10\\%$.\n", "  We suggest that dark matter may be partially constituted by a dilute 't\nHooft-Polyakov monopoles gas. We reach this conclusion by using the\nGeorgi-Glashow model coupled to a dual kinetic mixing term $ F{\\tilde {\\cal\nG}}$ where $F$ is the electromagnetic field and ${\\cal G}$ the 't Hooft tensor.\nWe show that these monopoles carry both (Maxwell) electric and (Georgi-Glashow)\nmagnetic charges and the electric charge quantization condition is modified in\nterms of a dimensionless real parameter. This parameter could be determined\nfrom milli-charged particle experiments.\n", "  We review the experimental and theoretical status of open heavy-flavor (HF)\nproduction in high-energy nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC. We first overview\nthe theoretical concepts and pertinent calculations of HF transport in QCD\nmatter, including perturbative and non-perturbative approaches in the\nquark-gluon plasma, effective models in hadronic matter, as well as\nimplementations of heavy-quark (HQ) hadronization. This is followed by a brief\ndiscussion of bulk evolution models for heavy-ion collisions and initial\nconditions for the HQ distributions which are needed to calculate HF spectra in\ncomparison to observables. We then turn to a discussion of experimental data\nthat have been collected to date at RHIC and LHC, specifically for the nuclear\nsuppression factor and elliptic flow of semileptonic HF decays, D mesons,\nnon-prompt $J/\\psi$ from B-meson decays, and b-jets. Model comparisons to HF\ndata are conducted with regards to extracting the magnitude, temperature and\nmomentum-dependence of HF transport coefficients from experiment.\n", "  Strain effects on epitaxial thin films of LaNiO3 grown on different single\ncrystalline substrates are studied by Raman scattering and first-principles\nsimulation. New Raman modes, not present in bulk or fully-relaxed films, appear\nunder both compressive and tensile strains, indicating symmetry reductions.\nInterestingly, the Raman spectra and the underlying crystal symmetry for\ntensile and compressively strained films are different. Extensive mapping of\nLaNiO3 phase stability is addressed by simulations, showing that a variety of\ncrystalline phases are indeed stabilized under strain which may impact the\nelectronic orbital hierarchy. The calculated Raman frequencies reproduce the\nprincipal features of the experimental spectra, supporting the validity of the\nmultiple strain-driven structural transitions predicted by the simulations.\n", "  During the asymptoyic giant branch (AGB) phase, different elements are\ndredge-up to the stellar surface depending on progenitor mass and metallicity.\nWhen the mass loss increases at the end of the AGB, a circumstellar dust shell\nis formed, where different (C-rich or O-rich) molecules and solid-state\ncompounds are formed. These are further processed in the transition phase\nbetween AGB stars and planetary nebulae (PNe) to create more complex organic\nmolecules and inorganic solid-state compounds (e.g., polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons, fullerenes, and graphene precursors in C-rich environments and\noxides and crystalline silicates in O-rich ones). We present an observational\nreview of the different molecules and solid-state materials that are formed\nfrom the AGB to the PN phases. We focus on the formation routes of complex\nfullerene (and fullerene-based) molecules as well as on the level of dust\nprocessing depending on metallicity.\n", "  Within a Kubo formalism, we study dc transport and ac optical properties of\n3D Dirac and Weyl semimetals. Emphasis is placed on the approach to charge\nneutrality and on the differences between Dirac and Weyl materials. At charge\nneutrality, the zero-temperature limit of the dc conductivity is not universal\nand also depends on the residual scattering model employed. However, the Lorenz\nnumber L retains its usual value L_0. With increasing temperature, the\nWiedemann-Franz law is violated. At high temperatures, L exhibits a new plateau\nat a value dependent on the details of the scattering rate. Such details can\nalso appear in the optical conductivity, both in the Drude response and\ninterband background. In the clean limit, the interband background is linear in\nphoton energy and always extrapolates to the origin. This background can be\nshifted to the right through the introduction of a massless gap. In this case,\nthe extrapolation can cut the axis at a finite photon energy as is observed in\nsome experiments. It is also of interest to differentiate between the two types\nof Weyl semimetals: those with broken time-reversal symmetry and those with\nbroken spatial-inversion symmetry. We show that, while the former will follow\nthe same behaviour as the 3D Dirac semimetals, for the zero magnetic field\nproperties discussed here, the latter type will show a double step in the\noptical conductivity at finite doping and a single absorption edge at charge\nneutrality. The Drude conductivity is always finite in this case, even at\ncharge neutrality.\n", "  The H$\\alpha$ surface brightness $-$ radius ($S-r$) relation is a robust\ndistance indicator for planetary nebulae (PNe), further enhanced by different\npopulations of PNe having distinct loci in $S-r$ space. Other types of\nphotoionized nebulae also plot in quite distinct regions in the $S-r$ plane,\nallowing its use as a diagnostic tool. In particular, the nova shells and\nmassive star ejecta (MSE) plot on relatively tight loci illustrating their\nevolutionary sequences. For the MSE, there is potential to develop a distance\nindicator for these objects, based on their trend in $S-r$ space. As\nhigh-resolution, narrowband surveys of the nearest galaxies become more\ncommonplace, the $S-r$ plane is a potentially useful diagnostic tool to help\nidentify the various ionized nebulae in these systems.\n", "  We discuss a residual freedom of the next-to-leading BFKL eigenvalue that\noriginates from ambiguity in redistributing the next-to-leading~(NLO)\ncorrections between the adjoint BFKL eigenvalue and eigenfunctions in planar\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills~(SYM) Theory. In terms of the remainder\nfunction of the Bern-Dixon-Smirnov~(BDS) amplitude this freedom is translated\nto reshuffling correction between the eigenvalue and the impact factors in the\nmulti-Regge kinematics~(MRK) in the next-to-leading logarithm\napproximation~(NLA). We show that the modified NLO BFKL eigenvalue suggested by\nthe authors can be introduced in the MRK expression for the remainder function\nby shifting the anomalous dimension in the impact factor in such a way that the\ntwo and three loop remainder function is left unchanged to the NLA accuracy.\n", "  In this work we introduce a new method of a ferromagnetic resonance (FMR)\ndetection from thin, nm-size, films. Our setup is based on the commercial\npiezo-cantilever, used for atomic force microscopy. It has an option to rotate\nthe sample in the magnetic field and it operates up to the high microwave\nfrequencies of 160 GHz. Using our cantilever based FMR spectrometer we have\ninvestigated a set of samples, namely quasi-bulk and 84 nm film\nCo$_2$FeAl$_{0.5}$Si$_{0.5}$ samples, 16 nm Fe$_{50}$Ni$_{50}$ film and 150 nm\nSr$_2$FeMoO$_6$ film. The high frequency ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) response\nfrom an extremely thin Fe$_{50}$Ni$_{50}$ film we have fitted with the\nconventional model for the magnetization dynamics. The cantilever detected FMR\nexperiments on Sr$_2$FeMoO$_6$ film reveal an inability of the conventional\nmodel to fit frequency and angular dependences with the same set of parameters,\nwhich suggests that one has to take into account much more complicated nature\nof the magnetization precession in the Sr$_2$FeMoO$_6$ at low temperatures and\nhigh frequencies. Moreover, the complicated dynamics of the magnetization\napparent in all investigated samples is suggested by a drastic increase of the\nlinewidths with increasing microwave frequency, and by an emergence of the\nsecond line with an opposite angular dependence.\n", "  We investigate the distribution of different classes of spectroscopically\nidentified sources and theoretical models in the color-color diagrams (CCDs)\ncombining the near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) data to develop a\nmethod to classify Outer Galaxy sources detected with the Spitzer Space\nTelescope (hereafter Spitzer) SMOG survey in the IRAC 3.6 and 8.0 micrometer\nand MIPS 24 micrometer bands. We supplement the Spitzer data with the data from\nother satellite and ground-based surveys. The main goal of our study is to\ndiscover and characterize the population of intermediate- and low-mass young\nstellar objects (YSOs) in the Outer Galaxy and use it to study star formation\nin a significantly different environment than the Galaxy inside the solar\ncircle. Since the YSOs can be confused with evolved stars in the MIR, these\nclasses of objects need to be carefully separated. Here we present the initial\nresults of our analysis using the Ks-[8.0] vs. Ks-[24] CCD as an example. The\nevolved stars separated from YSOs in the YSO selection process will be\ninvestigated in detail in the follow-up study.\n", "  When running time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations\nfor real-time simulations of non-equilibrium dynamics, the user has a choice of\ninitial Kohn-Sham state, and typically a Slater determinant is used. We explore\nthe impact of this choice on the exchange-correlation potential when the\nphysical system begins in a 50:50 superposition of the ground and first-excited\nstate of the system. We investigate the possibility of judiciously choosing a\nKohn-Sham initial state that minimizes errors when adiabatic functionals are\nused. We find that if the Kohn-Sham state is chosen to have a configuration\nmatching the one that dominates the interacting state, this can be achieved for\na finite time duration for some but not all such choices. When the Kohn-Sham\nsystem does not begin in a Slater determinant, we further argue that the\nconventional splitting of the exchange-correlation potential into exchange and\ncorrelation parts has limited value, and instead propose a decomposition into a\n\"single-particle\" contribution that we denote $v_{xc}^s$, and a remainder. The\nsingle-particle contribution can be readily computed as an explicit\norbital-functional, reduces to exchange in the Slater determinant case, and\noffers an alternative to the adiabatic approximation as a starting point for\nTDDFT approximations.\n", "  Preliminary ATLAS and CMS results from the first 13 TeV LHC run have\nencountered an intriguing excess of events in the diphoton channel around the\ninvariant mass of 750 GeV. We investigate a possibility that the current excess\nis due to a heavy resonance decaying to light metastable states, which in turn\ngive displaced decays to very highly collimated $e^+e^-$ pairs. Such decays may\npass the photon selection criteria, and successfully mimic the diphoton events,\nespecially at low counts. We investigate two classes of such models,\ncharacterized by the following underlying production and decay chains: $gg \\to\nS\\to A'A'\\to (e^+e^-)(e^+e^-)$ and $q\\bar q \\to Z' \\to sa\\to (e^+e^-)(e^+e^-)$,\nwhere at the first step a heavy scalar, $S$, or vector, $Z'$, resonances are\nproduced that decay to light metastable vectors, $A'$, or (pseudo-)scalars, $s$\nand $a$. Setting the parameters of the models to explain the existing excess,\nand taking the ATLAS detector geometry into account, we marginalize over the\nproperties of heavy resonances in order to derive the expected lifetimes and\ncouplings of metastable light resonances. We observe that in the case of $A'$,\nthe suggested range of masses and mixing angles $\\epsilon$ is within reach of\nseveral new-generation intensity frontier experiments.\n", "  The investigation of liquid flow at the nanoscale is a key area of applied\nresearch with high relevance to Physics, Chemistry and Biology. We introduce a\nmethod and a device that allows to spatially resolve liquid flow by integrating\nan array of graphene-based magnetic sensors used for tracking the movement of\nmagnetic nanoparticles in the liquid under investigation. With a novel device\nconception based on standard integration processes and experimentally verified\nmaterial parameters, we simulate the performance of a single sensor pixel, as\nwell as the whole array, for tracking magnetic nanoparticles. The results\ndemonstrate the ability (a) to detect individual nanoparticles in the liquid\nand (b) to reconstruct particle trajectories across the sensor array as a\nfunction of time, in what we call \"Magnetic Nanoparticle Velocimetry\"\ntechnique. Being a non-optical detection method, potential applications include\nparticle tracking and flow analysis in opaque media at sub-micron scales.\n", "  The properties of binary mixtures of dimethylsulfoxide and glycerol, measured\nby several techniques, are reported. Special attention is given to those\nproperties contributing or affecting chemical reactions. In this respect the\ninvestigated mixture behaves as a relatively simple solvent and it is\nespecially well suited for studies on the influence of viscosity in chemical\nreactivity. This is due to the relative invariance of the dielectric properties\nof the mixture. However, special caution must be taken with specific solvation,\nas the hydrogen-bonding properties of the solvent changes with the molar\nfraction of glycerol.\n", "  Assuming that tunnel effect between two degenerate bare minima occurs, in a\nscalar field theory at finite volume, this article studies the consequences for\nthe effective potential, to all loop orders. Convexity is achieved only if the\ntwo bare minima are taken into account in the path integral, and a new\nderivation of the effective potential is given, in the large volume limit. The\neffective potential has then has a universal form, it is suppressed by the\nspace time volume, and does not feature spontaneous symmetry breaking as long\nas the volume is finite. The finite temperature analysis leads to surprising\nthermal properties, following from the non-extensive expression for the free\nenergy. Although the physical relevance of these results is not clear, the\npotential application to ultra-light scalar particles is discussed.\n", "  The differential cross section and charge asymmetry for inclusive pp to W + X\nto mu + neutrino + X production at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV are measured as a function\nof muon pseudorapidity. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity\nof 18.8 inverse femtobarns recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC. These\nresults provide important constraints on the parton distribution functions of\nthe proton in the range of the Bjorken scaling variable x from 10E-3 to 10E-1.\n", "  We propose a class of kinematic variables, which is a smooth generalization\nof min-max type mass variables such as the Cambridge-$M_{T2}$ and $M_2$, for\nmeasuring a mass spectrum of intermediate resonances in a semi-invisibly\ndecaying pair production. While kinematic endpoints of min-max type mass\nvariables are only sensitive to a heavier resonance mass, kinematic endpoints\nof new variables are sensitive to all masses. These new mass variables can be\nused to resolve a mass spectrum, so that if the true mass spectrum is\nasymmetric, then the kinematic endpoints are separate while the endpoints are\nthe same for the symmetric true mass spectrum. We demonstrate the behavior of\nkinematic endpoint of these new variables in pair production of two-body and\nthree-body decays with one invisible particle.\n", "  We present a scheme to encode M extra classical bits to a dense-coded pair of\nphotons. By tuning the delay of an entangled pair of photons to one of 2^M\ntime-bins and then applying one of the quantum dense coding protocols, a\nreceiver equipped with a synchronized clock of reference is able to decode M\nbits (via classical time-bin encoding) + 2 bits (via quantum dense coding).\nThis protocol, yet simple, does not dispense several special features of the\nused programmable delay apparatus to maintain the coherence of the two-photon\nstate. While this type of time-domain encoding may be thought to be ideally of\nboundless photonic capacity (by increasing the number of available time-bins),\nerrors due to the environmental noise and the imperfect devices and channel\nevolve with the number of time-bins.\n", "  In this paper, we numerically demonstrate a new extraction scheme for\ngenerating ultra-fast physically random sequence of bits. For this purpose, we\nutilize a dual-channel optical chaos source with suppressed time delayed (TD)\nsignature in both the intensity and the phase of its two channels. The proposed\ntechnique uses M 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) to compare the level\nof the chaotic intensity signal at time t with its levels after incommensurable\ndelay-interval Tm, where m = {1,2,...,M}. The binary output of each 1-bit ADC\nis then sampled by a positive-edge-triggered D flip-flop. The clock sequence\napplied to the flip-flops is relatively delayed such that the rising edge of\nthe clock triggering the m flip-flop precedes the rising edge of the clock of a\nsubsequent m+1 flip-flop by a fixed period. The outputs of all flip-flops are\nthen combined by means of a parity-check logic. Numerical simulations are\ncarried out using values of parameters at which TD signature is suppressed for\nchosen values of setup parameters. The 15 statistical tests in Special\nPublication 800-22 from NIST are applied to the generated random bits in order\nto examine the randomness quality of these bits for different values of M. The\nresults show that all tests are passed from M = 1 to M = 39 at sampling rate up\nto 34.5 GHz which indicates that the maximum generation rate of random bits is\n2.691 Tb/sec using a chaotic source of single VCSEL and without employing any\npre-processing techniques.\n", "  The two-body bound and scattering properties in an one-dimensional harmonic\nwaveguide close to free space magnetic Feshbach resonances are investigated\nbased on the local frame transformation approach within a single partial wave\napproximation. An energy and magnetic field dependent free space phase shift is\nadopted in the current theoretical framework. For both $s$- and $p$-wave\ninteraction, the least bound state in the waveguide dissociates into the\ncontinuum at the resonant magnetic field where the effective one-dimensional\nscattering length $a_{\\rm 1D}$ diverges. Consequently, the association of atoms\ninto molecules in the waveguide occurs when the magnetic field is swept\nadiabatically across the pole of $a_{\\rm 1D}$. In the vicinity of broad\n$s$-wave resonances, the resonant magnetic field is nearly independent on the\ntransverse confining frequency $\\omega_{\\perp}$ of the waveguide. Close to\n$p$-wave and narrow $s$-wave resonances, the resonant magnetic field changes as\n$\\omega_{\\perp}$ varies.\n", "  We present benchmark points for LHC searches from flavored gauge mediation\nmodels, in which messenger-matter couplings give flavor-dependent squark\nmasses. Our examples include spectra in which a single squark - stop, scharm,\nor sup - is much lighter than all other colored superpartners, motivating\nimproved quark flavor tagging at the LHC. Many examples feature flavor mixing;\nin particular, large stop-scharm mixing is possible. The correct Higgs mass is\nobtained in some examples by virtue of the large stop A-term. We also revisit\nthe general flavor and CP structure of the models. Even though the A-terms can\nbe substantial, their contributions to EDM's are very suppressed, because of\nthe particular dependence of the A-terms on the messenger coupling. This holds\nregardless of the messenger-coupling texture. More generally, the special\nstructure of the soft terms often leads to stronger suppression of flavor- and\nCP-violating processes, compared to naive estimates.\n", "  In this paper we present a next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) calculation\nof the process $pp\\rightarrow \\gamma\\gamma$ that we have implemented into the\nparton level Monte Carlo code MCFM. We do not find agreement with the previous\ncalculation of this process in the literature. In addition to the\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$ corrections present at NNLO, we include some effects\narising at $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^3)$, namely those associated with\ngluon-initiated closed fermion loops. We investigate the role of this process\nin the context of studies of QCD at colliders and as a background for searches\nfor new physics, paying particular attention to the diphoton invariant mass\nspectrum. We demonstrate that the NNLO QCD prediction for the shape of this\nspectrum agrees well with functional forms used in recent data-driven fits.\n", "  Galactic magnetic fields in the local Universe are strong and omnipresent.\nThere is mounting evidence that galaxies were magnetized already in the early\nUniverse. Theoretical scenarios including the turbulent small-scale dynamo\npredict magnetic energy densities comparable to the one of turbulence. Based on\nthe assumption of this energy equipartition, we determine the galactic\nsynchrotron flux as a function of redshift z. The conditions in the early\nUniverse are different from the present day, in particular the galaxies have\nmore intense star formation. To cover a large range of conditions we consider\nmodels based on two different systems: one model galaxy comparable to the Milky\nWay and one typical high-z starburst galaxy. We include a model of the steady\nstate cosmic ray spectrum and find that synchrotron emission can be detected up\nto cosmological redshifts with current and future radio telescopes. Turbulent\ndynamo theory is in agreement with the origin of the observed correlation\nbetween the far-infrared (FIR) luminosity L_FIR and the radio luminosity\nL_radio. Our model reproduces this correlation well at z=0. We extrapolate the\nFIR-radio correlation to higher redshift and predict a time evolution with a\nsignificant deviation from its present-day appearance already at z~2 for a gas\ndensity that increases strongly with z. In particular, we predict a decrease of\nthe radio luminosity with redshift which is caused by the increase of cosmic\nray energy losses at high z. The result is an increase of the ratio between\nL_FIR and L_radio. Simultaneously, we predict that the slope of the FIR-radio\ncorrelation becomes shallower with redshift. This behavior of the correlation\ncould be observed in the near future with ultra-deep radio surveys.\n", "  We present a general analytic expansion in powers of $1/n$ of the resonant\nstates of quantum-mechanical systems, where $n=1,2,3,\\cdots$ is the excitation\nnumber. Explicit formulas are obtained for some potential barrier models.\n", "  Identical particle correlations at fixed multiplicity are considered by means\nof quantum canonical ensemble of finite systems. We calculate one-particle\nmomentum spectra and two-particle Bose-Einstein correlation functions in the\nideal gas by using a recurrence relation for the partition function. Within\nsuch a model we investigate the validity of the thermal Wick's theorem and its\napplicability for decomposition of the two-particle distribution function. The\ndependence of the Bose-Einstein correlation parameters on the average momentum\nof the particle pair is also investigated. Specifically, we present the\nanalytical formulas that allow one to estimate the effect of suppressing the\ncorrelation functions in a finite canonical system. The results can be used for\nthe femtoscopy analysis of the A+A and p+p collisions with selected (fixed)\nmultiplicity.\n", "  Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments, such as WMAP and Planck,\nmeasure intensity anisotropies and build maps using a \\emph{linearized} formula\nfor relating them to the temperature blackbody fluctuations. However such a\nprocedure also generates a signal in the maps in the form of y-type\ndistortions, and thus degenerate with the thermal SZ (tSZ) effect. These are\nsmall effects that arise at second-order in the temperature fluctuations not\nfrom primordial physics but from such a limitation of the map-making procedure.\nThey constitute a contaminant for measurements of: our peculiar velocity, the\ntSZ and of primordial y-distortions, but they can nevertheless be well-modelled\nand accounted for. We show that the largest distortions arises at high ell from\na leakage of the CMB dipole into the y-channel which couples to all multipoles,\nbut mostly affects the range ell <~ 400. This should be visible in Planck's\ny-maps with an estimated signal-to-noise ratio of about 9. We note however that\nsuch frequency-dependent terms carry no new information on the nature of the\nCMB dipole. This implies that the real significance of Planck's Doppler\ncoupling measurements is actually lower than quoted. Finally, we quantify the\nrelevance of the removal of such effects in order improve future measurements\nof tSZ and of primordial y-type distortions.\n", "  The main benefit of an interstellar mission is to carry out in-situ\nmeasurements within a target star system. To allow for extended in-situ\nmeasurements, the spacecraft needs to be decelerated. One of the currently most\npromising technologies for deceleration is the magnetic sail which uses the\ndeflection of interstellar matter via a magnetic field to decelerate the\nspacecraft. However, while the magnetic sail is very efficient at high\nvelocities, its performance decreases with lower speeds. This leads to\ndeceleration durations of several decades depending on the spacecraft mass.\nWithin the context of Project Dragonfly, initiated by the Initiative of\nInterstellar Studies (i4is), this paper proposes a novel concept for\ndecelerating a spacecraft on an interstellar mission by combining a magnetic\nsail with an electric sail. Combining the sails compensates for each\ntechnologys shortcomings: A magnetic sail is more effective at higher\nvelocities than the electric sail and vice versa. It is demonstrated that using\nboth sails sequentially outperforms using only the magnetic or electric sail\nfor various mission scenarios and velocity ranges, at a constant total\nspacecraft mass. For example, for decelerating from 5% c, to interplanetary\nvelocities, a spacecraft with both sails needs about 29 years, whereas the\nelectric sail alone would take 35 years and the magnetic sail about 40 years\nwith a total spacecraft mass of 8250 kg. Furthermore, it is assessed how the\ncombined deceleration system affects the optimal overall mission architecture\nfor different spacecraft masses and cruising speeds. Future work would\ninvestigate how operating both systems in parallel instead of sequentially\nwould affect its performance. Moreover, uncertainties in the density of\ninterstellar matter and sail properties need to be explored.\n", "  Several searches for new physics at the LHC require a fixed number of signal\njets, vetoing events with additional jets from QCD radiation. As the probed\nscale of new physics gets much larger than the jet-veto scale, such jet vetoes\nstrongly impact the QCD perturbative series, causing nontrivial theoretical\nuncertainties. We consider slepton pair production with 0 signal jets, for\nwhich we perform the resummation of jet-veto logarithms and study its impact.\nCurrently, the experimental exclusion limits take the jet-veto cut into account\nby extrapolating to the inclusive cross section using parton shower Monte\nCarlos. Our results indicate that the associated theoretical uncertainties can\nbe large, and when taken into account have a sizeable impact already on present\nexclusion limits. This is improved by performing the resummation to higher\norder, which allows us to obtain accurate predictions even for high slepton\nmasses. For the interpretation of the experimental results to benefit from\nimproved theory predictions, it would be useful for the experimental analyses\nto also provide limits on the unfolded visible 0-jet cross section.\n", "  We study the relative entropy and the trace square distance, both of which\nmeasure the distance between reduced density matrices of two excited states in\ntwo dimensional conformal field theories. We find a general formula for the\nrelative entropy between two primary states with the same conformal dimension\nin the limit of a single small interval and find that in this case the relative\nentropy is proportional to the trace square distance. We check our general\nformulae by calculating the relative entropy between two generalized free\nfields and the trace square distance between the spin and disorder operators of\nthe critical Ising model. We also give the leading term of the relative entropy\nin the small interval expansion when the two operators have different conformal\ndimensions. This turns out to be universal when the CFT has no primaires\nlighter than the stress tensor. The result reproduces the previously known\nspecial cases.\n", "  We present models of low- and high-ionization metal-line absorbers (O I, C\nII, C IV and Mg II) during the end of the reionization epoch, at z ~ 6. Using\nfour cosmological hydrodynamical simulations with different feedback schemes\n(including the Illustris and Sherwood simulations) and two different choices of\nhydro-solver, we investigate how the overall incidence rate and equivalent\nwidth distribution of metal-line absorbers varies with the galactic wind\nprescription. We find that the O I and C II absorbers are reasonably\ninsensitive to the feedback scheme. All models, however, struggle to reproduce\nthe observations of C IV and Mg II, which are probing down to lower\noverdensities than O I and C II at z ~ 6, suggesting that the metals in the\nsimulations are not being transported out into the IGM efficiently enough. The\nsituation is improved but not resolved if we choose a harder (but still\nreasonable) and/or (locally) increased UV background at z ~ 6.\n", "  The main goal of this paper is to put together: a) the Whitham theory\napplicable to slowly modulated $N$-phase nonlinear wave solutions to the\nfocusing nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (fNLS) equation, and b) the Riemann-Hilbert\nProblem approach to particular solutions of the fNLS in the semiclassical\n(small dispersion) limit that develop slowly modulated $N$-phase nonlinear wave\nin the process of evolution. Both approaches have their own merits and\nlimitations. Understanding of the interrelations between them could prove\nbeneficial for a broad range of problems involving the semiclassical fNLS.\n", "  We present the phase diagram and associated fixed points for a wide class of\nGauge-Yukawa theories in $d=4+\\epsilon$ dimensions. The theories we investigate\ninvolve non-abelian gauge fields, fermions and scalars in the Veneziano-Witten\nlimit. The analysis is performed in steps, we start with QCD$_d$ and then we\nadd Yukawa interactions and scalars which we study at next-to- and\nnext-to-next-to-leading order. Interacting infrared fixed points naturally\nemerge in dimensions lower than four while ultraviolet ones appear above four.\nWe also analyse the stability of the scalar potential for the discovered fixed\npoints. We argue for a very rich phase diagram in three dimensions while in\ndimensions higher than four certain Gauge-Yukawa theories are ultraviolet\ncomplete because of the emergence of an asymptotically safe fixed point.\n", "  Imaging the magnetic structure of a material is essential to understanding\nthe influence of the physical and chemical microstructure on its magnetic\nproperties. Magnetic imaging techniques, however, have up to now been unable to\nprobe 3D micrometer-sized systems with nanoscale resolution. Here we present\nthe imaging of the magnetic domain configuration of a micrometre-thick FeGd\nmultilayer with hard X-ray dichroic ptychography at energies spanning both the\nGd L3 edge and the Fe K edge, providing a high spatial resolution spectroscopic\nanalysis of the complex X-ray magnetic circular dichroism. With a spatial\nresolution reaching 45 nm, this advance in hard X-ray magnetic imaging is the\nfirst step towards the investigation of buried magnetic structures and extended\nthree-dimensional magnetic systems at the nanoscale.\n", "  We investigate the isoscalar and isovector E1 response of neutron-rich\nnuclei, within a semi-classical transport model employing effective\ninteractions for the nuclear mean-field. In particular, we adopt the recently\nintroduced SAMi-J Skyrme interactions, whose parameters are specifically tuned\nto improve the description of spin-isospin properties of nuclei. Our analysis\nevidences a relevant degree of isoscalar/isovector mixing of the collective\nexcitations developing in neutron-rich systems. Focusing on the low-lying\nstrength emerging in the isovector response, we show that this energy region\nessentially corresponds to the excitation of isoscalar-like modes, which also\ncontribute to the isovector response owing to their mixed character.\nConsidering effective interactions which mostly differ in the isovector\nchannels, we observe that these mixing effects increase with the slope L of the\nsymmetry energy at saturation density, leading to a larger strength in the\nlow-energy region of the isovector response. This result appears connected to\nthe increase, with L, of the neutron/proton asymmetry at the surface of the\nconsidered nuclei, i.e., to the extension of the neutron skin.\n", "  Enhanced Raman scattering can be obtained by injecting a seeded light field\nwhich is correlated with the initially prepared collective atomic excitation.\nThis Raman amplification process can be used to realize atom-light hybrid\ninterferometer. We numerically calculate the phase sensitivities and the\nsignal-to-noise ratios of this interferometer with the method of homodyne\ndetection and intensity detection, and give their differences between this two\nmethods. In the presence of loss of light field and atomic decoherence the\nmeasure precision will be reduced which can be explained by the break of the\nintermode decorrelation conditions of output modes\n", "  We develop the path integral formalism for studying cosmological\nperturbations in multi-field inflation, which is particularly well suited to\nstudy quantum theories with gauge symmetries such as diffeomorphism invariance.\nWe formulate the gauge fixing conditions based on the Poisson brackets of the\nconstraints, from which we derive two convenient gauges that are appropriate\nfor multi-field inflation. We then adopt the in-in formalism to derive the most\ngeneral expression for the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation\nincluding the corrections from the interactions of the curvature mode with\nother light degrees of freedom. We also discuss the contributions of the\ninteractions to the bispectrum.\n", "  Quantum annealing aims to exploit quantum mechanics to speed up the search\nfor the solution to optimization problems. Most problems exhibit complete\nconnectivity between the logical spin variables after they are mapped to the\nIsing spin Hamiltonian of quantum annealing. To account for hardware\nconstraints of current and future physical quantum annealers, methods enabling\nthe embedding of fully connected graphs of logical spins into a constant-degree\ngraph of physical spins are therefore essential. Here, we compare the recently\nproposed embedding scheme for quantum annealing with all-to-all connectivity\ndue to Lechner, Hauke and Zoller (LHZ) [Science Advances 1 (2015)] to the\ncommonly used minor embedding (ME) scheme. Using both simulated quantum\nannealing and parallel tempering simulations, we find that for a set of\ninstances randomly chosen from a class of fully connected, random Ising\nproblems, the ME scheme outperforms the LHZ scheme when using identical\nsimulation parameters, despite the fault tolerance of the latter to weakly\ncorrelated spin-flip noise. This result persists even after we introduce\nseveral decoding strategies for the LHZ scheme, including a minimum-weight\ndecoding algorithm that results in substantially improved performance over the\noriginal LHZ scheme. We explain the better performance of the ME scheme in\nterms of more efficient spin updates, which allows it to better tolerate the\ncorrelated spin-flip errors that arise in our model of quantum annealing. Our\nresults leave open the question of whether the performance of the two embedding\nschemes can be improved using scheme-specific parameters and new error\ncorrection approaches.\n", "  The Iterative Born Approximation (IBA) is a well-known method for describing\nwaves scattered by semi-transparent objects. In this paper, we present a novel\nnonlinear inverse scattering method that combines IBA with an edge-preserving\ntotal variation (TV) regularizer. The proposed method is obtained by relating\niterations of IBA to layers of a feedforward neural network and developing a\ncorresponding error backpropagation algorithm for efficiently estimating the\npermittivity of the object. Simulations illustrate that, by accounting for\nmultiple scattering, the method successfully recovers the permittivity\ndistribution where the traditional linear inverse scattering fails.\n", "  The effects of several dark energy models on gravitational time delay of\nparticles with non-zero mass are investigated and analytical expressions for\nthe same are obtained at the first order accuracy. Also the expression for\ngravitational time delay under the influence of conformal gravity potential\nthat well describes the flat rotation curve of spiral galaxies is derived. The\nfindings suggest that i) the conformal gravity description of dark matter\nreduces the net time delay in contrast to the effect of normal dark matter and\ntherefore in principle the models can be discriminated using gravitational time\ndelay observations and ii)the effect of dark energy/flat rotation curve may be\nrevealed from high precision measurements of gravitational time delay of\nparticles involving megaparsec and beyond distance-scale.\n", "  Ab-initio electron - liquid phase xenon fully differential cross-sections for\nelectrons scattering in liquid xenon are developed from a solution of the\nDirac-Fock scattering equations, using a recently developed framework [1] which\nconsiders multipole polarizabilities, a non-local treatment of exchange, and\nscreening and coherent scattering effects. A multi-term solution of Boltzmann's\nequation accounting for the full anisotropic nature of the differential\ncross-section is used to calculate transport properties of excess electrons in\nliquid xenon. The results were found to agree to within 25% of the measured\nmobilities and characteristic energies over the reduced field range of 10^{-4}\nto 1 Td. The accuracies are comparable to those achieved in the gas phase. A\nsimple model, informed by highly accurate gas-phase cross-sections, is\npresented to transform highly accurate gas-phase cross-sections to improve the\nliquid cross-sections, which was found to enhance the accuracy of the transport\ncoefficient calculations.\n", "  A variety of options for interpreting the D\\O{} state, $X(5568)$, are\nexamined. We find that threshold, cusp, molecular, and tetraquark models are\nall unfavoured. Several experimental tests for unravelling the nature of the\nsignal are suggested.\n", "  We make precise determinations of the leading scaling dimensions and operator\nproduct expansion (OPE) coefficients in the 3d Ising, $O(2)$, and $O(3)$ models\nfrom the conformal bootstrap with mixed correlators. We improve on previous\nstudies by scanning over possible relative values of the leading OPE\ncoefficients, which incorporates the physical information that there is only a\nsingle operator at a given scaling dimension. The scaling dimensions and OPE\ncoefficients obtained for the 3d Ising model, $(\\Delta_{\\sigma},\n\\Delta_{\\epsilon},\\lambda_{\\sigma\\sigma\\epsilon},\n\\lambda_{\\epsilon\\epsilon\\epsilon}) = (0.5181489(10), 1.412625(10),\n1.0518537(41), 1.532435(19))$, give the most precise determinations of these\nquantities to date.\n", "  We investigate the emergence of the continuum elastic limit from the\natomistic description of matter at zero temperature considering how locally\ndefined elastic quantities depend on the coarse graining length scale. Results\nobtained numerically investigating different model systems are rationalized in\na unifying picture according to which the continuum elastic limit emerges\nthrough a process determined by two system properties, the degree of disorder,\nand a length scale associated to the transverse low-frequency vibrational\nmodes. The degree of disorder controls the emergence of long-range local shear\nstress and shear strain correlations, while the transverse length scale\ninfluences the amplitude of the fluctuations of the local elastic constants.\n", "  The concept of symmetry breaking has been a propelling force in understanding\nphases of matter. While rotational symmetry breaking is one of the most\nprevalent examples, the rich landscape of orientational orders breaking the\nrotational symmetries of isotropic space, i.e. $O(3)$, to a three-dimensional\npoint group remain largely unexplored, apart from simple examples such as\nferromagnetic or uniaxial nematic ordering. Here we provide an explicit\nconstruction, utilizing a recently introduced gauge theoretical framework, to\naddress the three-dimensional point-group-symmetric orientational orders on a\ngeneral footing. This unified approach allows us to enlist order parameter\ntensors for all three dimensional point groups. By construction, these tensor\norder parameters are the minimal set of simplest tensors allowed by the\nsymmetries that uniquely characterize the orientational order. We explicitly\ngive these for the point groups $\\{C_n, D_n, T, O, I\\} \\subset SO(3)$ and\n$\\{C_{nv}, S_n, C_{nh}, D_{nh}, D_{nd}, T_h, T_d, O_h, I_h\\}\\subset O(3)$ for\n$n=\\{1,2,3,4,6, \\infty\\}$. This central result may be perceived as a roadmap\nfor identifying exotic orientational orders that may become more and more in\nreach in view of rapid experimental progress in e.g. nano-colloidal systems and\nnovel magnets.\n", "  The planned HL-LHC (High Luminosity LHC) in 2025 is being designed to\nmaximise the physics potential through a sizable increase in the luminosity up\nto 6*10^34 cm^-2 s^-1. A consequence of this increased luminosity is the\nexpected radiation damage at 3000 fb^-1 after ten years of operation, requiring\nthe tracking detectors to withstand fluences to over 1*10^16 1 MeV n_eq/cm^2 .\nIn order to cope with the consequent increased readout rates, a complete\nre-design of the current ATLAS Inner Detector (ID) is being developed as the\nInner Tracker (ITk). Two proposed detectors for the ATLAS strip tracker region\nof the ITk were characterized at the Diamond Light Source with a 3 um FWHM 15\nkeV micro focused X-ray beam. The devices under test were a 320 Um thick\nsilicon stereo (Barrel) ATLAS12 strip mini sensor wire bonded to a 130 nm CMOS\nbinary readout chip (ABC130) and a 320 Um thick full size radial (end-cap)\nstrip sensor - utilizing bi-metal readout layers - wire bonded to 250 nm CMOS\nbinary readout chips (ABCN-25). A resolution better than the inter strip pitch\nof the 74.5 um strips was achieved for both detectors. The effect of the p-stop\ndiffusion layers between strips was investigated in detail for the wire bond\npad regions. Inter strip charge collection measurements indicate that the\neffective width of the strip on the silicon sensors is determined by p-stop\nregions between the strips rather than the strip pitch.\n", "  We study the finite time singularity correspondence between the Jordan and\nEinstein frames for various $F(R)$ gravity theories. Particularly we\ninvestigate the ordinary pure $F(R)$ gravity case and the unimodular $F(R)$\ngravity cases, in the absence of any matter fluids. In the ordinary $F(R)$\ngravity cases, by using specific illustrative examples, we show that it is\npossible to have various correspondences of finite time singularities, and in\nsome cases it is possible a singular cosmology in one frame might be\nnon-singular in the other frame. In the unimodular $F(R)$ gravity case, the\nunimodular constraint is affected from the conformal transformation, so this\nhas an effect on the metric we choose. Moreover, we study the Einstein frame\ncounterpart theory of the unimodular $F(R)$ gravity case, and we investigate\nthe correspondences of the singularities in the two theories by considering\nspecific illustrative examples. Finally, a brief dynamical system analysis is\nperformed for the vacuum unimodular $F(R)$ gravity and we demonstrate how the\ndynamical system behaves near the future Big Rip singularity.\n", "  We propose a method for determining the spins of BPS states supported on line\ndefects in 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ theories of class S. Via the 2d-4d\ncorrespondence, this translates to the construction of quantum holonomies on a\npunctured Riemann surface $\\mathcal{C}$. Our approach combines the technology\nof spectral networks, which decomposes flat $GL(K,\\mathbb{C})$-connections on\n$\\mathcal{C}$ in terms of flat abelian connections on a $K$-fold cover of\n$\\mathcal{C}$, and the skein algebra in the 3-manifold $\\mathcal{C}\\times\n[0,1]$, which expresses the representation theory of the quantum group\n$U_q(gl_K)$. With any path on $\\mathcal{C}$, the quantum holonomy associates a\npositive Laurent polynomial in the quantized Fock-Goncharov coordinates of\nhigher Teichm\\\"uller space. This confirms various positivity conjectures in\nphysics and mathematics.\n", "  We investigate wave mixing effects in a phononic crystal that couples the\nwave dynamics of two channels -- primary and control ones -- via a variable\nstiffness mechanism. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that the wave\ntransmission in the primary channel can be manipulated by the control channel's\nsignal. We show that the application of control waves allows the selection of a\nspecific mode through the primary channel. We also demonstrate that the mixing\nof two wave modes is possible whereby a modulation effect is observed. A\ndetailed study of the design parameters is also carried out to optimize the\nswitching capabilities of the proposed system. Finally, we verify that the\nsystem can fulfill both switching and amplification functionalities,\npotentially enabling the realization of an acoustic transistor.\n", "  This paper develops a method to compute any bosonic conformal block as a\nseries expansion in the optimal radial coordinate introduced by Hogervorst and\nRychkov. The method reduces to the known result when the external operators are\nall the same scalar operator, but it allows to compute conformal blocks for\nexternal operators with spin. Moreover, we explain how to write closed form\nrecursion relations for the coefficients of the expansions. We study three\nexamples of four point functions in detail: one vector and three scalars; two\nvectors and two scalars; two spin 2 tensors and two scalars. Finally, for the\ncase of two external vectors, we also provide a more efficient way to generate\nthe series expansion using the analytic structure of the blocks as a function\nof the scaling dimension of the exchanged operator.\n", "  The infrared dynamics of $2+1$ dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED$_3$)\nwith a large number $N$ of fermion flavors is governed by an interacting CFT\nthat can be studied in the $1/N$ expansion. We use the $1/N$ expansion to\ncalculate the scaling dimensions of all the lowest three scalar operators that\ntransform under the $SU(N)$ flavor symmetry as a Young diagram with two columns\nof not necessarily equal heights and that have vanishing topological charge. In\nthe case of $SU(N)$ singlets, we study the mixing of $(\\bar \\psi_i \\psi^i)(\\bar\n\\psi_j \\psi^j)$ and $F_{\\mu\\nu} F^{\\mu\\nu}$, which are the lowest dimension\nparity-even singlets. Our results suggest that these operators are irrelevant\nfor all $N>1$.\n", "  LaAlO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$ heterostructure with polar and non-polar constituents\nhas been shown to exhibit interface metallic conductivity due to fractional\ncharge transfer to the interface. The interface reconstruction by electron\nredistribution along (001) orientation, in which half of an electron is\ntransferred per two dimensional unit cell to the adjacent planes, resulting in\na net transfer of half of the charge, to both the interface and top most atomic\nplanes, has been ascribed to a polar discontinuity at the interface in the\nPolar Catastrophe model. This avoids the divergence of electrostatic potential,\nas the number of layers are increased, producing an oscillatory electric field\nand finite potential. Akin to the description of charge fractionalization in\nquasi one-dimensional polyacetylene by the field theoretic Jackiw-Rebbi model\nwith fermions interacting with topologically non-trivial background field, we\nshow an analogous connection between polar catastrophe model and Bell-Rajaraman\nmodel, where the charge fractionalization occurs in the soliton free sector as\nan end effect.\n", "  We describe the finite-size spectrum in the vicinity of the quantum critical\npoint between a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid and a coplanar antiferromagnet on\nthe torus. We obtain the universal evolution of all low-lying states in an\nantiferromagnet with global SU(2) spin rotation symmetry, as it moves from the\n4-fold topological degeneracy in a gapped $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid to the\nAnderson \"tower-of-states\" in the ordered antiferromagnet. Due to the existence\nof nontrivial order on either side of this transition, this critical point\ncannot be described in a conventional Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson framework. Instead\nit is described by a theory involving fractionalized degrees of freedom known\nas the O$(4)^\\ast$ model, whose spectrum is altered in a significant way by its\nproximity to a topologically ordered phase. We compute the spectrum by relating\nit to the spectrum of the O$(4)$ Wilson-Fisher fixed point on the torus,\nmodified with a selection rule on the states, and with nontrivial boundary\nconditions corresponding to topological sectors in the spin liquid. The\nspectrum of the critical O($2N$) model is calculated directly at $N=\\infty$,\nwhich then allows a reconstruction of the full spectrum of the O($2N)^\\ast$\nmodel at leading order in 1/N. This spectrum is a unique characteristic of the\nvicinity of a fractionalized quantum critical point, as well as a universal\nsignature of the existence of proximate $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological and\nantiferromagnetically-ordered phases, and can be compared with numerical\ncomputations on quantum antiferromagnets on two dimensional lattices.\n", "  We investigate the $\\Lambda\\Lambda$ and $K^-p$ intensity correlations in\nhigh-energy heavy-ion collisions. First, we examine the dependence of the\n$\\Lambda\\Lambda$ correlation on the $\\Lambda\\Lambda$ interaction and the\n$\\Lambda\\Lambda$ pair purity probability $\\lambda$. For small $\\lambda$, the\ncorrelation function needs to be suppressed by the $\\Lambda\\Lambda$ interaction\nin order to explain the recently measured $\\Lambda\\Lambda$ correlation data. By\ncomparison, when we adopt the $\\lambda$ value evaluated from the experimentally\nmeasured $\\Sigma^0/\\Lambda$ ratio, the correlation function needs to be\nenhanced by the interaction. We demonstrate that these two cases correspond to\nthe two analyses which gave opposite signs of the $\\Lambda\\Lambda$ scattering\nlength. Next, we discuss the $K^-p$ correlation function. By using the local\n$\\bar{K}N$ potential which reproduces the kaonic hydrogen data by SIDDHARTA, we\nobtain the $K^-p$ correlation function. We find that the $K^-p$ correlation can\nprovide a complementary information with the $K^{-}p$ elastic scattering\namplitude.\n", "  Induced charge electrophoresis of a conducting cylinder suspended in a\nnon-conducting cylindrical pore is theoretically analyzed, and a micromotor is\nproposed utilizing the cylinder rotation. The cylinder velocities are\nanalytically obtained in the Dirichlet and the Neumann boundary conditions of\nthe electric field on the cylindrical pore. The results show that the cylinder\nnot only translates but also rotates when it is eccentric with respect to the\ncylindrical pore. The influences of a number of parameters on the cylinder\nvelocities are characterized in detail. The cylinder trajectories show that the\ncylinder approaches and rests at certain positions within the cylindrical pore.\nThe proposed micromotor is capable of working under a heavy load with a high\nrotational velocity when the eccentricity is large and the applied electric\nfield is strong.\n", "  We argue that extensions of the Standard Model (SM) with a warped extra\ndimension, which successfully address the hierarchy and flavor problems of\nelementary particle physics, can provide an elegant explanation of the 750 GeV\ndiphoton excess recently reported by ATLAS and CMS. A gauge-singlet bulk scalar\nwith ${\\cal O}(1)$ couplings to fermions is identified as the new resonance\n$S$, and the vector-like Kaluza-Klein excitations of the SM quarks and leptons\nmediate its loop-induced couplings to photons and gluons. The electroweak gauge\nsymmetry almost unambiguously dictates the bulk matter content and hence the\nhierarchies of the $S\\to \\gamma\\gamma$, $WW$, $ZZ$, $Z\\gamma$, $t\\bar t$ and\ndijet decay rates. We find that the $S\\to Z\\gamma$ decay mode is strongly\nsuppressed, such that $\\mbox{Br}(S\\to\nZ\\gamma)/\\mbox{Br}(S\\to\\gamma\\gamma)<0.1$. The hierarchy problem for the new\nscalar boson is solved in analogy with the Higgs boson by localizing it near\nthe infrared brane. The infinite sums over the Kaluza-Klein towers of fermion\nstates are finite and can be calculated in closed form with a remarkably simple\nresult. Reproducing the observed $pp\\to S\\to\\gamma\\gamma$ signal requires\nKaluza-Klein masses in the multi-TeV range, consistent with bounds from flavor\nphysics and electroweak precision observables.\n  Useful side products of our analysis, which can be adapted to almost any\nmodel for the diphoton resonance, are the calculation of the gluon-fusion\nproduction cross section $\\sigma(pp\\to S)$ at NNLO in QCD, an exact expression\nfor the inclusive $S\\to gg$ decay rate at N$^3$LO, a study of the $S\\to t\\bar t\nh$ three-body decay and a phenomenological analysis of portal couplings\nconnecting $S$ with the Higgs field.\n", "  An information theoretical model for quantum secret sharing was introduced by\nA. C. A. Nascimento et al.[Quantum Inf. Comput. Vol.5,1,205,68-79(2003)], which\nwas analyzed by quantum information theory. In this paper, we analyze this\ninformation theoretical model using the properties of the quantum access\nstructure. By the analysis we propose a generalized model definition for the\nquantum secret sharing schemes. In our model, there are more quantum access\nstructures which can be realized by our generalized quantum secret sharing\nschemes than those of the previous one. In addition, we also analyse two kinds\nof important quantum access structures to illustrate the existence and\nrationality of the generalized quantum secret sharing schemes and consider the\nsecurity of the scheme by simple examples.\n", "  The ESA mission \"Space Optical Clock\" project aims at operating an optical\nlattice clock on the ISS in approximately 2023. The scientific goals of the\nmission are to perform tests of fundamental physics, to enable space-assisted\nrelativistic geodesy and to intercompare optical clocks on the ground using\nmicrowave and optical links. The performance goal of the space clock is less\nthan $1 \\times 10^{-17}$ uncertainty and $1 \\times 10^{-15} {\\tau}^{-1/2}$\ninstability. Within an EU-FP7-funded project, a strontium optical lattice clock\ndemonstrator has been developed. Goal performances are instability below $1\n\\times 10^{-15} {\\tau}^{-1/2}$ and fractional inaccuracy $5 \\times 10^{-17}$.\nFor the design of the clock, techniques and approaches suitable for later space\napplication are used, such as modular design, diode lasers, low power\nconsumption subunits, and compact dimensions. The Sr clock apparatus is fully\noperational, and the clock transition in $^{88}$Sr was observed with linewidth\nas small as 9 Hz.\n", "  We provide unified phenomenological description of magnetooptic effects being\nlinear and quadratic in magnetization. The description is based on few\nprincipal spectra, describing elements of permittivity tensor up to the second\norder in magnetization. Each permittivity tensor element for any magnetization\ndirection and any sample surface orientation is simply determined by weighted\nsummation of the principal spectra, where weights are given by crystallographic\nand magnetization orientations. The number of principal spectra depends on the\nsymmetry of the crystal. In cubic crystals owning point symmetry we need only\nfour principal spectra. Here, the principal spectra are expressed by ab-initio\ncalculations for bcc Fe, fcc Co and fcc Ni in optical range as well as in hard\nand soft x-ray energy range, i.e. at the 2p- and 3p-edges. We also express\nprincipal spectra analytically using modified Kubo formula.\n", "  Mean square displacements of hydrogen atoms in glass-forming materials and\nproteins, as reported by incoherent elastic neutron scattering, show kinks in\ntheir temperature dependence. This crossover, known as the dynamical\ntransition, connects two approximately linear regimes. It is often assigned to\nthe dynamical freezing of subsets of molecular modes at the point of equality\nbetween their corresponding relaxation times and the instrumental observation\nwindow. The origin of the dynamical transition in glass-forming glycerol is\nstudied here by extensive molecular dynamics simulations. We find the dynamical\ntransition to occur for both the center of mass translations and the molecular\nrotations at the same temperature, insensitive to changes of the observation\nwindow. Both the translational and rotational dynamics of glycerol show a\ndynamic crossover from the structural to a secondary relaxation at the\ntemperature of the dynamical transition. A significant and discontinuous\nincrease in the orientational Kirkwood factor and in the dielectric constant is\nobserved in the same range of temperatures. We, however, do not find any\nindications of a true thermodynamic transition to an ordered low-temperature\nphase. We therefore suggest that all observed crossovers are dynamic in\ncharacter. The increase in the dielectric constant is related to the dynamic\nfreezing of dipolar domains on the time-scale of simulations.\n", "  In this article, we consider an interesting class of optical and other\nsystems in which the interaction or coupling makes the systems to be\n$\\cal{PT}$-symmetric. We aim to compare their dynamical behaviors with that of\nthe usual $\\cal{PT}$ symmetric systems with intrinsic loss-gain terms. In\nparticular, we focus on the interesting non-reciprocal nature of the $\\cal{PT}$\nsymmetric systems which has a promising application in optical diodes and\noptical isolators. We check whether the non-reciprocal nature is common to all\n$\\cal{PT}$ symmetric systems and, if not, what are the situations under which\nit can be observed. Due to the recent interest in studying spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking in coupled waveguide systems, we here present such symmetry breaking\nbifurcations in certain reciprocal and non-reciprocal $\\cal{PT}$ symmetric\nsystems.\n", "  We couple a laser-based, space-resolved dynamic light scattering apparatus to\na universal testing machine for mechanical extensional tests. We perform\nsimultaneous optical and mechanical measurements on polyether ether ketone, a\nsemi-crystalline polymer widely used in the industry. Due to the high turbidity\nof the sample, light is multiply scattered by the sample and the diffusing wave\nspectroscopy (DWS) formalism is used to interpret the data. Space-resolved DWS\nyields spatial maps of the sample strain and of the microscopic dynamics. An\nexcellent agreement is found between the strain maps thus obtained and those\nmeasured by a conventional stereo-correlation bench. The microscopic dynamics\nreveals both affine motion and plastic rearrangements. Thanks to the extreme\nsensitivity of DWS to displacements as small as 1 nm, plastic activity and its\nspatial localization can be detected at an early stage of the sample\ndeformation, making the technique presented here a valuable complement to\nexisting material characterization methods.\n", "  We demonstrate the importance of including the lensing contribution in galaxy\nclustering analyses with large galaxy redshift surveys. It is well known that\nradial cross-correlations between different redshift bins of galaxy surveys are\ndominated by lensing. But we show here that also neglecting lensing in the\nautocorrelations within one bin severely biases cosmological parameter\nestimation with redshift surveys. It leads to significant shifts for several\ncosmological parameters, most notably the scalar spectral index and the\nneutrino mass scale. Especially the latter parameter is one of the main targets\nof future galaxy surveys.\n", "  We show that strangeness suppression in hadronic and nuclear collisions is\nfully determined by the initial energy density of the collision. The\nsuppression factor $\\gamma_s(s)$, with $\\sqrt s$ denoting the collision energy,\ncan be expressed as a universal function of the initial energy density\n$\\epsilon_0(s)$, and the resulting pattern is in excellent agreement with data\nfrom $p-p,~p-Pb,~Cu-Cu,~Au-Au$ and $Pb-Pb$ data over a wide range of energies\nand for different centralities.\n", "  One main obstacle for any beyond the SM (BSM) scenario solving the hierarchy\nproblem is its potentially large contributions to electric dipole moments. An\nelegant way to avoid this problem is to have the light SM fermions couple to\nthe BSM sector only through bilinears, $\\bar ff$. This possibility can be\nneatly implemented in composite Higgs models. We study the implications of\ndynamically generating the fermion Yukawa couplings at different scales,\nrelating larger scales to lighter SM fermions. We show that all flavor and\nCP-violating constraints can be easily accommodated for a BSM scale of few TeV,\nwithout requiring any extra symmetry. Contributions to B physics are mainly\nmediated by the top, giving a predictive pattern of deviations in $\\Delta F=2$\nand $\\Delta F=1$ flavor observables that could be seen in future experiments.\n", "  We study the charmless two-body $\\Lambda_b\\to \\Lambda (\\phi,\\eta^{(\\prime)})$\nand three-body $\\Lambda_b\\to \\Lambda K^+K^- $ decays. We obtain ${\\cal\nB}(\\Lambda_b\\to \\Lambda\\phi)=(3.53\\pm 0.24)\\times 10^{-6}$ to agree with the\nrecent LHCb measurement. However, we find that ${\\cal B}(\\Lambda_b\\to\n\\Lambda(\\phi\\to)K^+ K^-)=(1.71\\pm 0.12)\\times 10^{-6}$ is unable to explain the\nLHCb observation of ${\\cal B}(\\Lambda_b\\to\\Lambda K^+ K^-)=(15.9\\pm 1.2\\pm\n1.2\\pm 2.0)\\times 10^{-6}$, which implies the possibility for other\ncontributions, such as that from the resonant $\\Lambda_b\\to K^-\nN^*,\\,N^*\\to\\Lambda K^+$ decay with $N^*$ as a higher-wave baryon state. For\n$\\Lambda_b\\to \\Lambda \\eta^{(\\prime)}$, we show that ${\\cal B}(\\Lambda_b\\to\n\\Lambda\\eta,\\,\\Lambda\\eta^\\prime)= (1.47\\pm 0.35,1.83\\pm 0.58)\\times 10^{-6}$,\nwhich are consistent with the current data of $(9.3^{+7.3}_{-5.3},<3.1)\\times\n10^{-6}$, respectively. Our results also support the relation of ${\\cal\nB}(\\Lambda_b\\to \\Lambda\\eta) \\simeq {\\cal B}(\\Lambda_b\\to\\Lambda\\eta^\\prime)$,\ngiven by the previous study.\n", "  A rigorous theory of photon emission accompanied inelastic tunnelling inside\nthe gap of plasmonic nanoantennas has been developed. The disappointingly low\nefficiency of the electrical excitation of surface plasmon polaritons in these\nstructures can be increased by orders of magnitude when a resonant tunnelling\nstructure is incorporated inside the gap. Resonant tunnelling assisted surface\nplasmon emitter may become a key element in future electrically-driven\nnanoplasmonic circuits.\n", "  We consider $N$ interacting dipolar bosonic atoms at zero temperature in a\ndouble-well potential. This system is described by the two-space-mode extended\nBose-Hubbard (EBH) Hamiltonian which includes (in addition to the familiar BH\nterms) the nearest-neighbor interaction, correlated hopping and bosonic-pair\nhopping. For systems with $N=2$ and $N=3$ particles we calculate analytically\nboth the ground state and the Fisher information, the coherence visibility, and\nthe entanglement entropy that characterize the correlations of the lowest\nenergy state. The structure of the ground state crucially depends on the\ncorrelated hopping $K_c$. On one hand we find that this process makes possible\nthe occurrence of Schr\\\"odinger-cat states even if the onsite interatomic\nattraction is not strong enough to guarantee the formation of such states. On\nthe other hand, in the presence of a strong onsite attraction, sufficiently\nlarge values of $|K_c|$ destroys the cat-like state in favor of a delocalized\natomic coherent state.\n", "  Acceptor-doped perovskite oxides like BaZrO$_3$ are showing great potential\nas materials for renewable energy technologies where hydrogen acts an energy\ncarrier, such as solid oxide fuel cells and hydrogen separation membranes.\nWhile ionic transport in these materials has been investigated intensively, the\nelectronic counterpart has received much less attention and further exploration\nin this field is required. Here, we use density functional theory (DFT) to\nstudy hole polarons and their impact on hole conductivity in Y-doped BaZrO$_3$.\nThree different approaches have been used to remedy the self-interaction error\nof local and semi-local exchange-correlation functionals: DFT$+U$, pSIC-DFT and\nhybrid functionals. Self-trapped holes are found to be energetically favorable\nby about $-$0.1 eV and the presence of yttrium results in further\nstabilization. Polaron migration is predicted to occur through intraoctahedral\ntransfer and polaron rotational processes, which are associated with adiabatic\nbarriers of about 0.1 eV. However, the rather small energies associated with\npolaron formation and migration suggest that the hole becomes delocalized and\nband-like at elevated temperatures. These results together with an endothermic\noxidation reaction [A. Lindman et al., Phys. Rev. B 91, 245114 (2015)] yield a\npicture that is consistent with experimental data for the hole conductivity.\nThe results we present here provide new insight into hole transport in\nacceptor-doped BaZrO$_3$ and similar materials, which will be of value in the\nfuture development of sustainable technologies.\n", "  Steady non-equilibrium states are investigated in a one-dimensional setup in\nthe presence of two thermodynamic currents. Two paradigmatic nonlinear\noscillators models are investigated: an XY chain and the discrete nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. Their distinctive feature is that the relevant variable\nis an angle in both cases. We point out the importance of clearly\ndistinguishing between energy and heat flux. In fact, even in the presence of a\nvanishing Seebeck coefficient, a coupling between (angular) momentum and energy\narises, mediated by the unavoidable presence of a \"coherent\" energy flux. Such\na contribution is the result of the \"advection\" induced by the\nposition-dependent angular velocity. As a result, in the XY model, the\nknowledge of the two diagonal elements of the Onsager matrix suffices to\nreconstruct its transport properties. The analysis of the nonequilibrium steady\nstates finally allows to strengthen the connection between the two models.\n", "  The MCNP5 code was employed to simulate the {\\gamma}ray shielding capacity of\ntungstate composites. The experimental results were applied to verify the\napplicability of the Monte Carlo program. PbWO4 and Bi2WO6 were prepared and\nadded into ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) to obtain the composites,\nwhich were tested in the {\\gamma}ray shielding. Both the theoretical simulation\nand experiments were carefully chosen and well designed. The results of the two\nmethods were found to be highly consistent. In addition, the conditions during\nthe numerical simulation were optimized and double-layer {\\gamma}ray shielding\nsystems were studied. It was found that the {\\gamma}-ray shielding performance\ncan be influenced not only by the material thickness ratio but also by the\narrangement of the composites.\n", "  We review the current knowledge about the theoretical foundations of the\neffective string theory for confining flux tubes and the comparison of the\npredictions to pure gauge lattice data. A concise presentation of the effective\nstring theory is provided, incorporating recent developments. We summarize the\npredictions for the spectrum and the profile/width of the flux tube and their\ncomparison to lattice data. The review closes with a short summary of open\nquestions for future research.\n", "  By incorporating our major recent discoveries with re-measured and verified\ncontents of existing catalogues we provide, for the first time, an accessible,\nreliable, on-line SQL database for essential, up-to date information for all\nknown Galactic PNe. We have attempted to: i) reliably remove PN mimics/false\nID's that have biased previous studies and ii) provide accurate positions,\nsizes, morphologies, multi-wavelength imagery and spectroscopy. We also provide\na link to CDS/Vizier for the archival history of each object and other valuable\nlinks to external data. With the HASH interface, users can sift, select,\nbrowse, collate, investigate, download and visualise the entire currently known\nGalactic PNe diversity. HASH provides the community with the most complete and\nreliable data with which to undertake new science.\n", "  The relation between the degree of entanglement and time scale of\ntime-irreversible behavior is investigated for classically chaotic quantum\ncoupled kicked rotors by comparing the entanglement entropy (EE) and the\nlifetime of correspondence with classical decay of correlation, which was\nrecently introduced. Both increase {\\it on average} drastically with a strong\ncorrelation when the strength of coupling between the kicked rotors exceeds a\ncertain threshold. The EE shows an anomalously large fluctuation resembling a\ncritical fluctuation around the threshold value of coupling strength where the\nentanglement sharply increases toward full entanglement. In this regime it can\nbe shown that, although the correlation is hidden, EE and the lifetime of {\\it\nindividual eigenfunctions} also have a positive correlation that can be seen\nvia an another measure.\n", "  The potential in coordinate space for the $\\Lambda N\\to NN$ weak transition,\nwhich drives the weak decay of most hypernuclei, is derived within the\neffective field theory formalism up to next-to-leading order. This coordinate\nspace potential allows us to discuss how the different contributions to the\npotential add up at the different scales. Explicit expressions are given for\neach two-pion-exchange diagram contributing to the interaction. The potential\nis also reorganized into spin and isospin operators, and the coefficient for\neach operator is given in analytical form and represented in coordinate space.\nThe relevance of explicitly including the mass differences among the baryons\nappearing in the two-pion-exchange diagrams is also discussed in detail.\n", "  Adaptive optics (AO) systems rely on the principle of reciprocity, or\nsymmetry with respect to the interchange of point sources and receivers. These\nsystems use the light received from a low power emitter on or near a target to\ncompensate profile aberrations acquired by a laser beam during linear\npropagation through random media. If, however, the laser beam propagates\nnonlinearly, reciprocity is broken, potentially undermining AO correction. Here\nwe examine the consequences of this breakdown. While discussed for general\nrandom and nonlinear media, we consider specific examples of Kerr-nonlinear,\nturbulent atmosphere.\n", "  We report several procedures for the robust nucleation of magnetic domain\nwalls in cylindrical permalloy nanowires. Specific features of the magnetic\nforce microscopy contrast of such soft wires are discussed, with a view to\navoid the misinterpretation of the magnetization states. The domain walls could\nbe moved under quasistatic magnetic fields in the range 0.1--10 mT.\n", "  In the search for missing baryonic resonances, many analyses include data\nfrom a variety of pion- and photon-induced reactions. For elastic $\\pi N$\nscattering, however, usually the partial waves of the SAID or other groups are\nfitted, instead of data. We provide the partial-wave covariance matrices needed\nto perform correlated $\\chi^2$ fits, in which the obtained $\\chi^2$ equals the\nactual $\\chi^2$ up non-linear and normalization corrections. For any analysis\nrelying on partial waves extracted from elastic pion scattering, this is a\nprerequisite to assess the significance of resonance signals and to assign any\nuncertainty on results. The influence of systematic errors is also considered.\n", "  We report magnetoresistance for current flow through iron/topological\ninsulator (Fe/TI) and Fe/evaporated-oxide/TI contacts when a magnetic field is\nused to initially orient the magnetic alignment of the incorporated\nferromagnetic Fe bar, at temperatures ranging from 100 K to room temperature.\nThis magnetoresistance is associated with the relative orientation of the Fe\nbar magnetization and spin-polarization of electrons moving on the surface of\nthe TI with helical spin-momentum locking. The magnitude of the observed\nmagnetoresistance is relatively large compared to that observed in prior work.\n", "  Recent LHC data hinted at a 750 GeV mass resonance that decays into two\nphotons. A significant feature of this resonance is that its decays to any\nother Standard Model particles would be too low to be detected so far. Such a\nstate has a compelling explanation in terms of a scalar or a pseudoscalar that\nis strongly coupled to vector states charged under the Standard Model gauge\ngroups. Such a scenario is readily accommodated in bulk RS with a scalar\nlocalized in the bulk away from but close to the Higgs. Turning this around, we\nargue that a good way to find the elusive bulk RS model might be the search for\na resonance with prominent couplings to gauge bosons.\n", "  We develop analytical models of the longitudinal and transverse wakes, on and\noff axis for realistic structures, and then compare them with numerical\ncalculations, and generally find good agreement. These analytical \"first order\"\nformulas approximate the droop at the origin of the longitudinal wake and of\nthe slope of the transverse wakes; they represent an improvement in accuracy\nover earlier, \"zeroth order\" formulas. In example calculations for the\nRadiaBeam/LCLS dechirper using typical parameters, we find a 16\\% droop in the\nenergy chirp at the bunch tail compared to simpler calculations. With the beam\nmoved to 200~$\\mu$m from one jaw in one dechiper section, one can achieve a\n3~MV transverse kick differential over a 30~$\\mu$m length.\n", "  We use a kinematic parametrisation of the luminosity distance to measure the\nangular distribution on the sky of time derivatives of the scale factor, in\nparticular the Hubble parameter H_0, the deceleration parameter q_0, and the\njerk parameter j_0. We apply a recently published method to complement probing\nthe inhomogeneity of the large-scale structure by means of the inhomogeneity in\nthe cosmic expansion. This parametrisation is independent of the cosmological\nequation of state, which renders it adequate to test interpretations of the\ncosmic acceleration alternative to the cosmological constant. For the same\nanalytical toy model of an inhomogeneous ensemble of homogenous pixels, we\nderive the backreaction term in j_0 due to the fluctuations of {H_0,q_0} and\nmeasure it to be of order 10^{-2} times the corresponding average over the\npixels in the absence of backreaction. In agreement with that computed using a\nLambda CDM parametrisation of the luminosity distance, the backreaction effect\non q_0 remains below the detection threshold. Although the backreaction effect\non j_0 is about ten times that on q_0, it is also below the detection\nthreshold. Hence backreaction remains unobservable both in q_0 and in j_0.\n", "  Five TeV neutrino events weakly correlated with five gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)\nwere detected recently by IceCube. This work is an attempt to show that if the\nGRB identifications are verified, the observed time delays between the TeV\nneutrinos and gamma-ray photons from GRBs provide attractive candidates for\ntesting fundamental physics with high accuracy. Based on the assumed\nassociations between the TeV neutrinos and GRBs, we find that the limiting\nvelocity of the neutrinos is equal to that of photons to an accuracy of\n$\\sim1.9\\times10^{-15}-2.5\\times10^{-18}$, which is about $10^{4}-10^{7}$ times\nbetter than the constraint obtained with the neutrino possibly from a blazar\nflare. In addition, we set the most stringent limits up to date on the energy\nscale of quantum gravity for both the linear and quadratic violations of\nLorentz invariance, namely $E_{\\rm QG, 1}>6.3\\times10^{18}-1.5\\times10^{21}$\nGeV and $E_{\\rm QG, 2}>2.0\\times10^{11}-4.2\\times10^{12}$ GeV, which are\nessentially as good as or are an improvement of one order of magnitude over the\nresults previously obtained by the GeV photons of GRB 090510 and the PeV\nneutrino from a blazar flare. Assuming that the Shapiro time delay is caused by\nthe gravitational potential of the Laniakea supercluster of galaxies, we also\nplace the tightest limits to date on Einstein's weak equivalence principle\nthrough the relative differential variations of the parameterized\npost-Newtonian parameter $\\gamma$ values for two different species of particles\n(i.e., neutrinos and photons), yielding $\\Delta\\gamma \\sim 10^{-11}-10^{-13}$.\nHowever, it should be emphasized again that these limits here obtained are at\nbest forecast of what could be achieved if the GRB/neutrino correlations would\nbe finally confirmed.\n", "  A systematic and compact treatment of arbitrary $su(2)$ invariant spin-$s$\nquantum chains with nearest-neighbour interactions is presented. The\nground-state is derived in terms of matrix product states (MPS). The\nfundamental MPS calculations consist of taking products of basic tensors of\nrank 3 and contractions thereof. The algebraic $su(2)$ calculations are carried\nout completely by making use of Wigner calculus. As an example of application,\nthe spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic quantum chain is investigated. Various physical\nquantities are calculated with high numerical accuracy of up to 7 digits. We\nobtain explicit results for the ground-state energy, entanglement entropy,\nsinglet operator correlations and the string order parameter. We find\ninteresting crossover phenomena in the correlation lengths.\n", "  In this paper we study a Clifford algebra generalization of the quaternions\nand its relationship with braid group representations related to Majorana\nfermions. The Fibonacci model for topological quantum computing is based on the\nfusion rules for a Majorana fermion. Majorana fermions can be seen not only in\nthe structure of collectivies of electrons, as in the quantum Hall effect, but\nalso in the structure of single electrons both by experiments with electrons in\nnanowires and also by the decomposition of the operator algebra for a fermion\ninto a Clifford algebra generated by two Majorana operators. The purpose of\nthis paper is to discuss these braiding representations, important for\nrelationships among physics, quantum information and topology. A new result in\nthis paper is the Clifford Braiding Theorem. This theorem shows that the\nMajorana operators give rise to a particularly robust representation of the\nbraid group that is then further represented to find the phases of the fermions\nunder their exchanges in a plane space. The more robust representation in our\nbraiding theorem will be the subject of further work.\n", "  Gaberdiel and Gopakumar recently proposed that the tensionless limit of\nstring theory on $AdS_3 \\times S^3 \\times T^4$ takes the form of a higher spin\ntheory with a gauge algebra that is referred to as the higher spin square. In\nthis note, we formulate the linearized Vasiliev-type equations which describe a\nmatter field coupled to the higher spin square. We study the particle spectrum\nof this field and show that it accounts for the entire untwisted sector of the\ndual symmetric orbifold CFT, thereby confirming a conjecture by Gaberdiel and\nGopakumar. In doing so, we pinpoint the group-theoretic data which determine\nthe spectrum of a matter field coupled to a general higher spin algebra, which\nwe illustrate by revisiting the theory based on the $hs[1/2]$ algebra.\n", "  We present six new planetary nebulae (PNe) discovered in the Small Magellanic\nCloud (SMC) from deep UK Schmidt telescope (UKST) narrow band Halpha and\nbroad-band short-red \"SR\" continuum images and confirmed spectroscopically.\nThese 6 preliminary discoveries provide a 6% increase to the previously known\nSMC PN population of ~100. Once spectroscopic follow-up of all our newly\nidentified candidates is complete, we expect to increase the total number of\nknown SMC PNe by up to 50%. This will permit a significant improvement to\ndetermination of the SMC PN luminosity function (PNLF) and enable further\ninsights into the chemical evolution and kinematics of the SMC PN population.\n", "  The propagation of neutrinos in long baselines experiments may be influenced\nby dissipation effects. Using Lindblad Master Equation we evolve neutrinos\ntaking into account these dissipative effects. The MSW and the dissipative\neffects may change the probabilities behavior. In this work, we show and\nexplain how the behavior of the probabilities can change due to the decoherence\nand relaxation effects acting individually with the MSW effect. A new exotic\npeak appears in this case and we show the difference between the decoherence\nand relaxation effects in the appearance of this peak. We also adapt the usual\napproximate expression for survival and appearance probabilities with all\npossible decoherence effects. We suppose the baseline of DUNE and show how each\ndecoherence parameters change the probabilities analyzing the possible\nmodification using numeric and analytic approach.\n", "  Models where Dark Matter and Dark Energy interact with each other have been\nproposed to solve the coincidence problem. We review the motivations underlying\nthe need to introduce such interaction, its influence on the background\ndynamics and how it modifies the evolution of linear perturbations. We test\nmodels using the most recent observational data and we find that the\ninteraction is compatible with the current astronomical and cosmological data.\nFinally, we describe the forthcoming data sets from current and future\nfacilities that are being constructed or designed that will allow a clearer\nunderstanding of the physics of the dark sector.\n", "  It is found that the Lorentz force generated by the magnetic drift drives a\ngeneric plasma pinch fluxes of particle, energy and momentum through the\nStokes-Einstein relation. The proposed theoretical model applies for both\nelectrons and ions, trapped particles and passing particles.\n", "  We study the special case of $n\\times n$ 1D Gaussian Hermitian random band\nmatrices, when the covariance of the elements is determined by the matrix\n$J=(-W^2\\triangle+1)^{-1}$. Assuming that $n\\ge CW\\log W\\gg 1$, we prove that\nthe averaged density of states coincides with the Wigner semicircle law up to\nthe correction of order $W^{-1}$.\n", "  Pure theories of AdS$_3$ quantum gravity are conjectured to be dual to CFTs\nwith sparse spectra of light primary operators. The sparsest possible spectrum\nconsistent with modular invariance includes only black hole states above the\nvacuum. Witten conjectured the existence of a family of extremal CFTs, which\nrealize this spectrum for all admissible values of the central charge. We\nconsider the quantum corrections to the classical spectrum, and propose a\nspecific modification of Witten's conjecture which takes into account the\nexistence of \"small\" black hole states. These have zero classical horizon area,\nwith a calculable entropy attributed solely to loop effects. Our conjecture\npasses various consistency checks, especially when generalized to include\ntheories with supersymmetry. In theories with $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry,\nthis \"near-extremal CFT\" proposal precisely evades the no-go results of\nGaberdiel et al.\n", "  Helium nanodroplets irradiated by intense near-infrared laser pulses ignite\nand form highly ionized nanoplasmas even at laser intensities where helium is\nnot directly ionized by the optical field, provided the droplets contain a few\ndopant atoms. We present a combined theoretical and experimental study of the\nHe nanoplasma ignition dynamics for various dopant species. We find that the\nefficiency of dopants to ignite a nanoplasma in helium droplets strongly varies\nand mostly depends on (i) the pick-up process, (ii) the number of free\nelectrons each dopant donates upon ionization, and remarkably, (iii) by the\nhitherto unexplored effect of the dopant location in or on the droplet.\n", "  Materials undergoing antiferroelectric/ferroelectric (AFE/FE) transitions are\nstudied for possible applications that exploit the large volume, charge and\nentropy differences between the two states, such as electrocaloric cooling,\nenergy storage, electromechanical actuators. Though certain compositions of PZT\ncodoped with La and Sn may withstand millions of electrically induced AFE/FE\ncycles, in other cases few thermally induced cycles and room temperature aging\nmay cause noticeable changes in the material properties. This is particularly\nevident in the elastic moduli, which at room temperature can become as much as\nfour times softer. In order to get more insight into the mechanisms involved in\nsuch elastic aging and full recovering with mild annealing at 600-800 K, the\neffect of La doping on PZT with 4.6% Ti is studied with anelastic measurements.\nComplete suppression of the time dependent phenomena is found after the\ntransformation of the intermediate FE phase into incommensurate AFE by 2% La\ndoping. This is discussed in terms of disappearance of the stress and electric\nfields at the FE/AFE interfaces, in the light of the thermally activated\nanelastic relaxation processes that are observed at high temperature, and are\ndue to mobile defects, presumably O vacancies.\n", "  While lot of measurements describe the relaxation dynamics of the liquid\nstate, experimental data of the glass dynamics at high temperatures are much\nscarcer. We use ultrafast scanning calorimetry to expand the timescales of the\nglass to much shorter values than previously achieved. Our data show that the\nrelaxation time of glasses follows a super-Arrhenius behaviour in the\nhigh-temperature regime above the conventional devitrification temperature\nheating at 10 K/min. The liquid and glass states can be described by a common\nVFT-like expression that solely depends on temperature and limiting fictive\ntemperature. We apply this common description to nearly-isotropic glasses of\nindomethacin, toluene and to recent data on metallic glasses. We also show that\nthe dynamics of indomethacin glasses obey density scaling laws originally\nderived for the liquid. This work provides a strong connection between the\ndynamics of the equilibrium supercooled liquid and non-equilibrium glassy\nstates.\n", "  We investigate general properties of non-deterministic self-assembly with\nasymmetric interactions, using a computational model and DNA tile assembly\nexperiments. By contrasting symmetric and asymmetric interactions we show that\nthe latter can lead to self-limiting cluster growth. Furthermore, by adjusting\nthe relative abundance of self-assembly particles in a two-particle mixture, we\nare able to tune the final sizes of these clusters. We show that this is a\nfundamental property of asymmetric interactions, which has potential\napplications in bioengineering, and provides new insights into the study of\ndiseases caused by protein aggregation.\n", "  Using modified spin wave (MSW) method, we study the $J_1-J_2$ Heisenberg\nmodel with first and second neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange interactions.\nFor symmetric $S=1/2$ model, with the same couplings for all the equivalent\nneighbors, we find three phase in terms of frustration parameter\n${\\bar\\alpha=J_2/J_1}$: (1) a commensurate collinear ordering with staggered\nmagnetization (N{\\'e}el.I state) for $0\\leq{\\bar\\alpha}\\lesssim 0.207$ , (2) a\nmagnetically gapped disordered state for $0.207\\lesssim{\\bar\\alpha}\\lesssim\n0.369$, preserving all the symmetries of the Hamiltonian and lattice, hence by\ndefinition is a quantum spin liquid (QSL) state and (3) a commensurate\ncollinear ordering in which two out of three nearest neighbor magnetizations\nare antiparallel and the remaining pair are parallel (N{\\'e}el.II state), for\n$0.396\\lesssim{\\bar\\alpha}\\leq 1$. We also explore the phase diagram of\ndistorted $J_1-J_2$ model with $S=1/2$. Distortion is introduced as an\ninequality of one nearest neighbor coupling with the other two. This yields a\nricher phase diagram by the appearance of a new gapped QSL, a gapless QSL and\nalso a valence bond crystal (VBC) phase in addition to the previously three\nphases found for undistorted model.\n", "  We show that the 750 GeV di-photon excess can be interpreted as a spin-2\nresonance arising from a strongly interacting dark sector featuring some\ndeparture from conformality. This spin-2 resonance has negligible couplings to\nthe SM particles, with the exception of the SM gauge bosons which mediate\nbetween the two sectors. We have explicitly studied the collider constraints as\nwell as some theoretical bounds in a holographic five dimensional model with a\nwarp factor that deviates from AdS$_5$. In particular, we have shown that it is\nnot possible to decouple the vector resonances arising from the strong sector\nwhile explaining the di-photon anomaly and keeping the five dimensional gravity\ntheory under perturbative control. However, vector resonances with masses\naround the TeV scale can be present while all experimental constraints are met.\n", "  We consider the commutative limit of matrix geometry described by a large-$N$\nsequence of some Hermitian matrices. Under some assumptions, we show that the\ncommutative geometry possesses a K\\\"{a}hler structure. We find an explicit\nrelation between the K\\\"{a}hler structure and the matrix configurations which\ndefine the matrix geometry. We also find a relation between the matrix\nconfigurations and those obtained from the geometric quantization.\n", "  We investigate the effects of the reversal of the gravitational field onto a\nsedimented and partially crystallised suspension of nearly-hard sphere\ncolloids. We analyse the structural changes that take place during the melting\nof the crystalline regions and the reorganisation and assembly of the\nsedimenting particles. Through a comparison with numerical simulation, we\naccess the single-particle kinetics and identify the key structural mechanism\nin the competition between five-fold symmetric and cubic crystalline\nstructures. With the use of a coarse-grained, discrete model, we reproduce the\nkinetic network of reactions underpinning crystallisation and highlight the\nmain microscopic transitions.\n", "  Jet grooming algorithms are widely used in experimental analyses at hadron\ncolliders to remove contaminating radiation from within jets. While the\nalgorithms perform a great service to the experiments, their intricate\nalgorithmic structure and multiple parameters has frustrated precision\ntheoretic understanding. In this paper, we demonstrate that one particular\ngroomer called soft drop actually makes precision jet substructure easier. In\nparticular, we derive a factorization formula for a large class of soft drop\njet substructure observables, including jet mass. The essential observation\nthat allows for this factorization is that, without the soft wide-angle\nradiation groomed by soft drop, all singular contributions are collinear. The\nsimplicity and universality of the collinear limit in QCD allows us to show\nthat to all orders, the normalized differential cross section has no\ncontributions from non-global logarithms. It is also independent of process, up\nto the relative fraction of quark and gluon jets. In fact, soft drop allows us\nto define this fraction precisely. The factorization theorem also explains why\nsoft drop observables are less sensitive to hadronization than their ungroomed\ncounterparts. Using the factorization theorem, we resum the soft drop jet mass\nto next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. This requires calculating some\nclustering effects that are closely related to corresponding effects found in\njet veto calculations. We match our resummed calculation to fixed order results\nfor both $e^+e^-\\to$ dijets and $pp\\to Z+j$ events, producing the first jet\nsubstructure predictions (groomed or ungroomed) to this accuracy for the LHC.\n", "  Understanding the particle-scale transition from elastic deformation to\nplastic flow is central to making predictions about the bulk material\nproperties and response of disordered materials. To address this issue, we\nperform experiments on flow-stabilized solids composed of micron-scale spheres\nwithin a microfluidic channel, in a regime where particle inertia is\nnegligible. Each solid heap exists within a stress gradient imposed by the\nflow, and we track the positions of particles in response to single impulses of\nfluid-driven compression or decompression. We find that the resulting\ndeformation field is well-decomposed into an affine field, with a constant\nstrain profile throughout the solid, and a non-affine field. The magnitude of\nthis non-affine response decays with the distance from the free surface in the\nlong-time limit, suggesting that the distance from jamming plays a significant\nrole in controlling the length scale of plastic flow. Finally, we observe that\ncompressive pulses create more rearrangements than decompressive pulses, an\neffect that we quantify using the $D^2_\\mathrm{min}$ statistic for non-affine\nmotion. Unexpectedly, the time scale for the compression response is shorter\nthan for decompression at the same strain (but unequal pressure), providing\ninsight into the coupling between deformation and cage-breaking.\n", "  Quantum field theories (QFTs) at finite densities of matter generically\ninvolve complex actions. Standard Monte-Carlo simulations based upon importance\nsampling, which have been producing quantitative first principle results in\nparticle physics for almost fourty years, cannot be applied in this case.\nVarious strategies to overcome this so-called Sign Problem or Complex Action\nProblem were proposed during the last thirty years. We here review the sign\nproblem in lattice field theories, focussing on two more recent methods:\nDualization to world-line type of representations and the density-of-states\napproach.\n", "  We study the effects of disorder on strongly coupled compressible matter in\n2+1 dimensions. Our system consists of a D3/D5 intersection at finite\ntemperature and in the presence of a disordered chemical potential. We first\nstudy the impact of disorder on the charge density and the quark condensate.\nNext, we focus on the DC conductivity and derive analytic expressions for the\ncorrections induced by weak disorder. It is found that disorder enhances the DC\nconductivity at low charge density, while for large charge density the\nconductivity is reduced. We present numerical simulations both for weak and\nstrong disorder. Finally, we show how disorder gives rise to a sublinear\nbehavior for the conductivity as a function of the charge density, a behavior\nqualitatively similar to predictions and observations for electric transport in\ngraphene.\n", "  A special class of metrics, called universal metrics, solve all gravity\ntheories defined by covariant field equations purely based on the metric\ntensor. Since we currently lack the knowledge of what the full of\nquantum-corrected field equations of gravity are at a given microscopic length\nscale, these metrics are particularly important in understanding quantum fields\nin curved backgrounds in a consistent way. But, finding explicit universal\nmetrics has been a hard problem as there does not seem to be a procedure for\nit. In this work, we overcome this difficulty and give a construction of\nuniversal metrics of d-dimensional spacetime from curves constrained to live in\na (d-1)-dimensional Minkowski spacetime or a Euclidean space.\n", "  Tree-level double-color-ordered amplitudes are computed using Berends--Giele\nrecursion relations applied to the bi-adjoint cubic scalar theory. The standard\nnotion of Berends--Giele currents is generalized to double-currents and their\nrecursions are derived from a perturbiner expansion of linearized fields that\nsolve the non-linear field equations. Two applications are given. Firstly, we\nprove that the entries of the inverse KLT matrix are equal to Berends--Giele\ndouble-currents (and are therefore easy to compute). And secondly, a simple\nformula to generate tree-level BCJ-satisfying numerators for arbitrary\nmultiplicity is proposed by evaluating the field-theory limit of tree-level\nstring amplitudes for various color orderings using double-color-ordered\namplitudes.\n", "  We derive an explicit bound on the dimension of the lightest charged state in\ntwo dimensional conformal field theories with a global abelian symmetry. We\nfind that the bound scales with $c$ and provide examples that parametrically\nsaturate this bound. We also prove than any such theory must contain a state\nwith charge-to-mass ratio above a minimal lower bound. We comment on the\nimplications for charged states in three dimensional theories of gravity.\n", "  A remarkable property of dense suspensions is that they can transform from\nliquid-like at rest to solid-like under sudden impact. Previous work showed\nthat this impact-induced solidification involves rapidly moving jamming fronts;\nhowever, details of this process have remained unresolved. Here we use\nhigh-speed ultrasound imaging to probe non-invasively how the interior of a\ndense suspension responds to impact. Measuring the speed of sound we\ndemonstrate that the solidification proceeds without a detectable increase in\npacking fraction, and imaging the evolving flow field we find that the shear\nintensity is maximized right at the jamming front. Taken together, this\nprovides direct experimental evidence for jamming by shear, rather than\ndensification, as driving the transformation to solid-like behavior. Based on\nthese findings we propose a new model to explain the anisotropy in the\npropagation speed of the fronts and delineate the onset conditions for dynamic\nshear jamming in suspensions.\n", "  Diverse molecules induce general anesthesia with potency strongly correlated\nboth with their hydrophobicity and their effects on certain ion channels. We\nrecently observed that several n-alcohol anesthetics inhibit heterogeneity in\nplasma membrane derived vesicles by lowering the critical temperature ($T_c$)\nfor phase separation. Here we exploit conditions that stabilize membrane\nheterogeneity to further test the correlation between the anesthetic potency of\nn-alcohols and effects on $T_c$. First we show that hexadecanol acts oppositely\nto n-alcohol anesthetics on membrane mixing and antagonizes ethanol induced\nanesthesia in a tadpole behavioral assay. Second, we show that two previously\ndescribed `intoxication reversers' raise $T_c$ and counter ethanol's effects in\nvesicles, mimicking the findings of previous electrophysiological and\nbehavioral measurements. Third, we find that hydrostatic pressure, long known\nto reverse anesthesia, also raises $T_c$ in vesicles with a magnitude that\ncounters the effect of butanol at relevant concentrations and pressures. Taken\ntogether, these results demonstrate that $\\Delta T_c$ predicts anesthetic\npotency for n-alcohols better than hydrophobicity in a range of contexts,\nsupporting a mechanistic role for membrane heterogeneity in general anesthesia.\n", "  Representations of atomic orbitals based on Monte-Carlo (MC) approaches are\nnot always correct when using various sets of orthogonal coordinates other than\nCartesian coordinates. The analysis proposed here gives elements for a proper\nuse of MC methodology. It can be very useful for students and for teachers.\n", "  By means of mesoscopic numerical simulations of a model soft-glassy material,\nwe investigate the role of boundary roughness on the flow behaviour of the\nmaterial, probing the bulk/wall and global/local rheologies. We show that the\nroughness reduces the wall slip induced by wettability properties and acts as a\nsource of fluidisation for the material. A direct inspection of the plastic\nevents suggests that their rate of occurrence grows with the fluidity field,\nreconciling our simulations with kinetic elasto-plastic descriptions of jammed\nmaterials. Notwithstanding, we observe qualitative and quantitative differences\nin the scaling, depending on the distance from the rough wall and on the\nimposed shear. The impact of roughness on the orientational statistics is also\nstudied.\n", "  We investigate the interaction of two pulses (pump and probe) scattered by a\nnonlinear epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) slab whose thickness is comparable with the\nENZ wavelength. We show that when the probe has a narrow spectrum localized\naround the ENZ wavelength its transmission is dramatically affected by the\nintensity of the pump. Conversely, if the probe is not in the ENZ regime, its\npropagation is not noticeably affected by the pump. Such all-optical modulation\nis due to the oversensitive character of the ENZ regime and it is so efficient\nto even occur in a wavelength thick slab.\n", "  The CONNIE detector prototype is operating at a distance of 30 m from the\ncore of a 3.8 GW$_{\\rm th}$ nuclear reactor with the goal of establishing\nCharge-Coupled Devices (CCD) as a new technology for the detection of coherent\nelastic neutrino-nucleus scattering. We report on the results of the\nengineering run with an active mass of 4 g of silicon. The CCD array is\ndescribed, and the performance observed during the first year is discussed. A\ncompact passive shield was deployed for the detector, producing an order of\nmagnitude reduction in the background rate. The remaining background observed\nduring the run was stable, and dominated by internal contamination in the\ndetector packaging materials. The {\\it in-situ} calibration of the detector\nusing X-ray lines from fluorescence demonstrates good stability of the readout\nsystem. The event rates with the reactor on and off are compared, and no excess\nis observed coming from nuclear fission at the power plant. The upper limit for\nthe neutrino event rate is set two orders of magnitude above the expectations\nfor the standard model. The results demonstrate the cryogenic CCD-based\ndetector can be remotely operated at the reactor site with stable noise below 2\ne$^-$ RMS and stable background rates. The success of the engineering test\nprovides a clear path for the upgraded 100 g detector to be deployed during\n2016.\n", "  We study odd viscosity in a holographic model of a Weyl semimetal. The model\nis characterised by a quantum phase transition from a topological semimetal to\na trivial semimetal state. Since the model is axisymmetric in three spatial\ndimensions there are two independent odd viscosities. Both odd viscosity\ncoefficients are non-vanishing in the quantum critical region and non-zero only\ndue to the mixed axial gravitational anomaly. It is therefore a novel example\nin which the mixed axial gravitational anomaly gives rise to a transport\ncoefficient at first order in derivatives at finite temperature. We also\ncompute anisotropic shear viscosities and show that one of them violates the\nKSS bound. In the quantum critical region, the physics of viscosities as well\nas conductivities is governed by the quantum critical point.\n", "  We apply the large-$N_c$ expansion to the time-reversal-invariance-violating\n(TV) nucleon-nucleon potential. The operator structures contributing to\nnext-to-next-to-leading order in the large-$N_c$ counting are constructed. For\nthe TV and parity-violating case we find a single operator structure at leading\norder. The TV but parity-conserving potential contains two leading-order terms,\nwhich however are suppressed by 1/$N_c$ compared to the parity-violating\npotential. Comparison with phenomenological potentials, including the chiral\nEFT potential in the TV parity-violating case, leads to large-$N_c$ scaling\nrelations for TV meson-nucleon and nucleon-nucleon couplings.\n", "  Isoscalar monopole transitions from the ground states to cluster states in\n$\\Be$ and $\\Li$ are investigated with $\\He+\\alpha$ and $\\He+t$ cluster models,\nrespectively. In $\\Be$, significant monopole strengths to $\\He+\\alpha$ cluster\nresonances of $\\Be(0^+_{3,4})$ above the $\\alpha$-decay threshold are obtained,\nwhereas those to $\\He+t$ cluster resonances in $^9$Li are not enhanced because\nof the large fragmentation of the strengths in the corresponding energy region.\nThe monopole transition to $\\Be(0^+_2)$ having the molecular orbital structure\nis relatively weak compared with those to $\\He+\\alpha$ cluster resonances.\n  Monopole strength distributions do not directly correspond to distributions\nof $\\He(0^+)+\\alpha$ and $\\He(0+)+t$ components but they reflect component of\nthe deformed $\\He$ cluster with a specific orientation, which is originally\nembedded in the ground state.\n", "  The spectrum of a semi-infinite quantum graph tube with square period cells\nis analyzed. The structure is obtained by rolling up a doubly periodic quantum\ngraph into a tube along a period vector and then retaining only a semi-infinite\nhalf of the tube. The eigenfunctions associated to the spectrum of the\nhalf-tube involve all Floquet modes of the full tube. This requires solving the\ncomplex dispersion relation $D(\\lambda,k_1,k_2)=0$ with\n$(k_1,k_2)\\in(\\mathbb{C}/2\\pi\\mathbb{Z})^2$ subject to the constraint $\\alpha\nk_1 + \\beta k_2 \\equiv 0$ (mod $2\\pi$), where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are\nintegers. The number of Floquet modes for a given $\\lambda\\in\\mathbb{R}$ is\n$2\\max\\left\\{ \\alpha, \\beta \\right\\}$. Rightward and leftward modes are\ndetermined according to an indefinite energy flux form. The spectrum may\ncontain eigenvalues that depend on the boundary conditions, and some\neigenvalues may be embedded in the continuous spectrum.\n", "  We theoretically investigate dynamics of antiferromagnetic domain walls\ndriven by spin-orbit torques in antiferromagnet/heavy metal bilayers. We show\nthat spin-orbit torques drive antiferromagnetic domain walls much faster than\nferromagnetic domain walls. As the domain wall velocity approaches the maximum\nspin-wave group velocity, the domain wall undergoes Lorentz contraction and\nemits spin-waves in the terahertz frequency range. The interplay between spin\norbit torques and the relativistic dynamics of antiferromagnetic domain walls\nleads to the efficient manipulation of antiferromagnetic spin textures and\npaves the way for the generation of high frequency signals in antiferromagnets.\n", "  We study the near-threshold incoherent $\\phi$ photoproduction on the deuteron\nbased on a model of $\\gamma N \\to \\phi N$, consisting of Pomeron, $(\\pi, \\eta)$\nexchanges, and a $J^P = 3/2^-$ resonance, which describes the low energy\n$\\gamma p \\to \\phi p$ LEPS data well, including the peak in the forward\ndifferential cross section.\n  The calculation is done up to double rescatterings, with the spin dependence\nof the elementary $\\gamma N \\to \\phi N$ amplitude retained throughout the\ncalculation. The Fermi motion and final-state interactions (FSI) are all\nproperly treated as prescribed by realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction. The\ncouplings of the resonance to $\\gamma n$ and $\\phi n$ channels are estimated\nwith the help of a constituent quark model. The main features of the LEPS and\nCLAS data are described reasonably well except for some quantitative\ndiscrepancies at very low energies and low momentum transfers regions. It is\nfound that contributions of Fermi motion, $pn$ FSI, and resonance are all\nindispensable in bridging the differences between the single-scattering results\nand the data. The off-shell rescattering is found to be important as it cancels\nout a large portion of the on-shell contribution. The discrepancies at low\nmomentum transfer region might be related to the binning size of the data. No\npeak is found to be associated with the weak resonance as it gets smeared out\nby the Fermi motion and FSI with deuterium target. The problem at very low\nenergy region hints at the possible contributions from other mechanisms and\nshould be investigated in depth with the use of recent high statistics $\\gamma\np \\to \\phi p$ data from CLAS.\n", "  General half-BPS A-type boundary conditions are formulated for N=2\nsupersymmetric field theories on compact 3-manifolds with boundary. We observe\nthat under suitable conditions manifolds of the real A-type admitting two\ncomplex supersymmetries (related by charge conjugation) possess, besides a\ncontact structure, a natural integrable toric foliation. A boundary, or a\ngeneral co-dimension-1 defect, can be inserted along any leaf of this preferred\nfoliation to produce manifolds with boundary that have the topology of a solid\ntorus. We show that supersymmetric field theories on such manifolds can be\nendowed with half-BPS A-type boundary conditions. We specify the natural curved\nspace generalization of the A-type projection of bulk supersymmetries and\nanalyze the resulting A-type boundary conditions in generic 3d non-linear sigma\nmodels and YM/CS-matter theories.\n", "  Using ideas of Olson \\cite{Ols} who showed that the system of effect\noperators of a Hilbert space can be ordered by the so-called spectral order\nsuch that the system of effect operators is a complete lattice. Using his\nideas, we introduce a partial order, called the Olson order, on the set of\nbounded observables of a complete lattice effect algebra. We show that the set\nof bounded observables is a Dedekind complete lattice.0\n", "  The use of cylindrical elastic shells as elements in acoustic metamaterial\ndevices is demonstrated through simulations and underwater measurements of a\ncylindrical-to-plane wave lens. Transformation acoustics (TA) of a circular\nregion to a square dictates that the effective density in the lens remain\nconstant and equal to that of water. Piecewise approximation to the desired\neffective compressibility is achieved using a square array with elements based\non the elastic shell metamaterial concept developed in [30]. The size of the\nelements are chosen based on availability of shells, minimizing fabrication\ndifficulties. The tested device is neutrally buoyant comprising 48 elements of\nnine different types of commercial shells made from aluminum, brass, copper,\nand polymers. Simulations indicate a broadband range in which the device acts\nas a cylindrical to plane wave lens. The experimental findings confirm the\nbroadband quadropolar response from approximately 20 to 40 kHz, with positive\ngain of the radiation pattern in the four plane wave directions.\n", "  We extend the semiclassical theory of short periodic orbits [Phys. Rev. E\n{\\bf 80}, 035202(R) (2009)] to partially open quantum maps. They correspond to\nclassical maps where the trajectories are partially bounced back due to a\nfinite reflectivity $R$. These maps are representative of a class that has many\nexperimental applications. The open scar functions are conveniently redefined,\nproviding a suitable tool for the investigation of these kind of systems. Our\ntheory is applied to the paradigmatic partially open tribaker map. We find that\nthe set of periodic orbits that belong to the classical repeller of the open\nmap ($R=0$) are able to support the set of long-lived resonances of the\npartially open quantum map in a perturbative regime. By including the most\nrelevant trajectories outside of this set, the validity of the approximation is\nextended to a broad range of $R$ values. Finally, we identify the details of\nthe transition from qualitatively open to qualitatively closed behaviour,\nproviding an explanation in terms of short periodic orbits.\n", "  We have performed Ce $L_3$-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Ce\n$4d$-$4f$ resonant photoemission spectroscopy (PES) on single crystals of\nCeO$_{1-x}$F$_x$BiS$_2$ for $x=0.0$ and 0.5 in order to investigate the Ce $4f$\nelectronic states. In the Ce $L_3$-edge XAS, mixed valence of Ce was found in\nthe $x=0.0$ sample and the F-doping suppresses it, which is consistent with the\nresults on polycrystalline samples. As for the resonant PES, we found that the\nCe $4f$ electrons in both $x=0.0$ and $0.5$ systems respectively form a flat\nband at 1.0 eV and 1.4 eV below the Fermi level and there is no contribution to\nthe Fermi surfaces. Interestingly, Ce valence in CeOBiS$_2$ deviates from\nCe$^{3+}$ even though Ce $4f$ electrons are localized, indicating the Ce\nvalence is not in a typical valence fluctuation regime. We assume that\nlocalized Ce $4f$ in CeOBiS$_2$ is mixed with the unoccupied Bi $6p_z$, which\nis consistent with the previous local structural study. Based on the analysis\nof the Ce $L_3$-edge XAS spectra using Anderson's impurity model calculation,\nwe found that the transfer integral becomes smaller increasing the number of Ce\n$4f$ electrons upon the F substitution for O.\n", "  Knowledge of the transverse four-dimensional beam rms-parameters is essential\nfor applications that involve lattice elements that couple the two transverse\ndegrees of freedom (planes). Of special interest is the removal of inter-plane\ncorrelations to reduce the projected emittances. A dedicated ROtating System\nfor Emittance measurements (ROSE) has been proposed, developed, and\nsuccessfully commissioned to fully determine the four-dimensional beam matrix.\nThis device has been used at the High Charge injector (HLI) at GSI using a beam\nline which is composed of a skew quadrupole triplet, a normal quadrupole\ndoublet, and ROSE. Mathematical algorithms, measurements, and results for ion\nbeams of 83Kr13+ at 1.4 MeV/u are reported in this paper.\n", "  We report a dual-frequency injection-locked continuous-wave near-infrared\nlaser. The entire system consists of a Ti:sapphire ring laser as a power\noscillator, two independent diode-lasers employed as seed lasers, and a master\ncavity providing a frequency reference. Stable dual-frequency injection-locked\noscillation is achieved with a maximum output power of 2.8 W. As fundamental\nperformance features of this laser system, we show its single\nlongitudinal/transverse mode characteristics and practical power stability.\nFurthermore, as advanced features, we demonstrate arbitrary selectivity of the\ntwo frequencies and flexible control of their relative powers by simply\nmanipulating the seed lasers.\n", "  The Matter-Wave laser Interferometer Gravitation Antenna, MIGA, will be a\nhybrid instrument composed of a network of atom interferometers horizontally\naligned and interrogated by the resonant field of an optical cavity. This\ndetector will provide measurements of sub Hertz variations of the gravitational\nstrain tensor. MIGA will bring new methods for geophysics for the\ncharacterization of spatial and temporal variations of the local gravity field\nand will also be a demonstrator for future low frequency Gravitational Wave\n(GW) detections. MIGA will enable a better understanding of the coupling at low\nfrequency between these different signals. The detector will be installed\nunderground in Rustrel (FR), at the \"Laboratoire Souterrain Bas Bruit\" (LSBB),\na facility with exceptionally low environmental noise and located far away from\nmajor sources of anthropogenic disturbances. We give in this paper an overview\nof the operating mode and status of the instrument before detailing simulations\nof the gravitational background noise at the MIGA installation site.\n", "  Monolayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are two-dimensional\nmaterials whose low energy sector consists of two inequivalent valleys. The\nvalence bands have a large spin splitting due to strong spin-orbit coupling.\nFurthermore the spin is polarized up in one valley and down in the other (in\ndirections perpendicular to the two-dimensional crystal). We focus on lightly\nhole-doped systems where the Fermi surface consists of two disconnected circles\nwith opposite spins. For both proximity induced and intrinsic local attractive\ninteraction induced superconductivity, a fully gapped intervalley pairing state\nis favored in this system, which is an equal superposition of the singlet and\nthe m=0 triplet for the lack of centrosymmetry. We show that a\nferromagnetically ordered magnetic-adatom chain placed on a monolayer TMD\nsuperconductor provides a platform to realize one-dimensional topological\nsuperconducting state characterized by the presence of Majorana zero modes at\nits ends. We obtain the topological phase diagram and show that the topological\nsuperconducting phase is affected not only by the adatom spacing and the\ndirection of the magnetic moment, but also by the orientation of the chain\nrelative to the crystal.\n", "  Surface and interfacial weakly-nonlinear ring waves in a two-layer fluid are\nmodelled numerically, within the framework of the recently derived\n2+1-dimensional cKdV-type equation. In a case study, we consider concentric\nwaves from a localised initial condition and waves in a 2D version of the\ndam-break problem, as well as discussing the effect of a piecewise-constant\nshear flow. The modelling shows, in particular, the formation of 2D dispersive\nshock waves (DSWs) and oscillatory wave trains. The surface and interfacial\nDSWs generated in our numerical experiments look distinctively different.\n", "  A central feature of the Periodic Anderson Model is the competition between\nantiferromagnetism, mediated by the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction\nat small conduction electron-local electron hybridization $V$, and singlet\nformation at large $V$. At zero temperature, and in dimension $d>1$, these two\nphases are separated by a quantum critical point $V_c$. We use Quantum Monte\nCarlo simulations to explore the effect of impurities which have a local\nhybridization $V_{*} < V_c$ in the AF regime which are embedded in a bulk\nsinglet phase with $V > V_c$. We measure the suppression of singlet\ncorrelations and the antiferromagnetic correlations which form around the\nimpurity, as well as the size of the resulting domain. Our calculations agree\nqualitatively with NMR measurements in CeCoIn$_{5-x}$Cd$_x$.\n", "  We study the production of a Standard Model Higgs boson in the gluon-fusion\nchannel at the 13 TeV LHC. Our results are accurate to the next-to-leading\norder in QCD, bar for the lack of some two-loop amplitudes, for up to two extra\njets and are matched to the PYTHIA8 Monte Carlo. We address the impact, at the\nlevel of inclusive rates and of differential distributions, of the merging of\nsamples characterised by different final-state multiplicities, and of the\neffects induced by top and bottom masses through heavy-quark loop diagrams. We\nfind that both the merging and the heavy-quark masses must be included in the\ncalculation in order to realistically predict observables of experimental\ninterest.\n", "  The effective Lagrangian expansion provides a framework to study effects of\nnew physics at the electroweak scale. To make full use of LHC data in\nconstraining higher-dimensional operators we need to include both the Higgs and\nthe electroweak gauge sector in our study. We first present an analysis of the\nrelevant di-boson production LHC results to update constraints on triple gauge\nboson couplings. Our bounds are several times stronger than those obtained from\nLEP data. Next, we show how in combination with Higgs measurements the triple\ngauge vertices lead to a significant improvement in the entire set of\noperators, including operators describing Higgs couplings.\n", "  We study a single field axion inflation model in the presence of an SU(2)\ngauge field with a small vev. In order to make the analysis as\nmodel-independent as possible, we consider an arbitrary potential for the axion\nthat is able to support the slow-roll inflation. The gauge field is coupled to\nthe axion with a Chern-Simons interaction $\\frac{\\lambda}{f}F_{\\mu\\nu}^a\\tilde\nF_a^{\\mu\\nu}$ where $\\frac{\\lambda}{f}\\sim\\mathcal{O}(10)$. It has a negligible\neffect on the background evolution, $\\frac{\\rho_{_{\\rm YM}}}{M_{\\rm\nPl}^2H^2}\\lesssim\\epsilon^2$. However, its quantum fluctuations make a\nsignificant contribution to the cosmic perturbation. In particular, the gauge\nfield has a spin-2 fluctuation which explicitly breaks the parity between the\nleft- and right-handed polarization states. The chiral tensor modes are\nlinearly coupled to the gravitational waves and lead to a circularly polarized\ntensor power spectrum comparable to the unpolarized vacuum power spectrum.\nMoreover, the scalar sector is modified by the linear scalar fluctuations of\nthe gauge field. Since the spin-0 and spin-2 fluctuations of the SU(2) gauge\nfield are independent, the gauge field can, at the same time, generate a\ndetectable chiral gravitational wave signal and have a negligible contribution\nto the scalar fluctuations, in agreement with the current CMB observations.\n", "  The well-known effects of the spin-orbit interaction of light are\nmanifestations of pair mutual influence of the three types of the angular\nmomentum of light, namely, the spin angular momentum, the extrinsic orbital\nangular momentum and the intrinsic orbital angular momentum. Here we propose\nthe convenient classification of the effects of the spin-orbit interaction of\nlight and we observe one of the new effects in the frame of this\nclassification, which is determined by the joint influence of two types of the\nangular momentum on the third type of the angular momentum, namely, the\ninfluence of the spin angular momentum and the extrinsic orbital angular\nmomentum on the intrinsic orbital angular momentum. We experimentally studied\nthe propagation of circularly polarized light through an optical fiber coiled\ninto a helix. We have found that the spin angular momentum and the helix\nparameters affect the spatial structure of the radiation transmitted through\nthe optical fiber. We found out that the structure of the light field rotates\nwhen changing the sign of circular polarization. The angle of rotation depends\non the parameters of the helix. The results can be used to develop the general\ntheory of spinning particles and can find application in metrology methods and\nnanooptics devices.\n", "  Black hole solutions of type IIB supergravity were previously found that are\ndual to N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma with an anisotropic spatial\ndeformation. In the zero temperature limit, these black holes approach a\nLiftshitz like scaling solution in the IR. It was recently shown that these\nblack holes are unstable, and at low temperatures there is a new class of black\nhole solutions that are thermodynamically preferred. We extend this analysis,\nby considering consistent truncations of the Kaluza-Klein reduction of IIB\nsupergravity on a five-sphere that preserves multiple scalar and $U(1)$ gauge\nfields. We show that the previously constructed black holes become unstable at\nlow temperatures, and construct new classes of exotic black hole solutions. We\nstudy the DC thermo-electric conductivity of these $U(1)$ charged black holes,\nand find a diverging DC conductivity at zero temperature due to the divergence\nof the gauge field coupling.\n", "  The Schroedinger eigenvalue problems for the Whittaker-Hill potential\n$Q_{2}(x)=\\tfrac{1}{2} h^2\\cos4x+4h\\mu\\cos2x$ and the periodic complex\npotential $Q_{1}(x)=\\tfrac{1}{4}h^2{\\rm e}^{-4ix}+2h^2\\cos2x$ are studied using\ntheir realizations in two-dimensional conformal field theory (2dCFT). It is\nshown that for the weak coupling (small) $h\\in\\mathbb{R}$ and non-integer\nFloquet parameter $\\nu\\notin\\mathbb{Z}$ spectra of hamiltonians\n$H_{i}\\!=\\!-{\\rm d}^2/{\\rm d}x^2 + Q_{i}(x)$, $i=1,2$ and corresponding two\nlinearly independent eigenfunctions are given by the classical limit of the\n\"single flavor\" and \"two flavors\" ($N_f=1,2$) irregular conformal blocks. It is\nknown that complex non-hermitian hamiltonians which are PT-symmetric (=\ninvariant under simultaneous parity P and time reversal T transformations) can\nhave real eigenvalues. The hamiltonian $H_{1}$ is PT-symmetric for\n$h,x\\in\\mathbb{R}$. It is found that $H_{1}$ has a real spectrum in the weak\ncoupling region for $\\nu\\in\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\mathbb{Z}$. This fact in an\nelementary way follows from a definition of the $N_f=1$ classical irregular\nblock. Thus, $H_{1}$ can serve as yet another new model for testing postulates\nof PT-symmetric quantum mechanics.\n", "  In this work we study a system that consists of $2M$ matter qubits that\ninteract through a boson sampling circuit, i.e., an $M$-port interferometer,\nembedded in two different architectures. We prove that, under the conditions\nrequired to derive a master equation, the qubits evolve according to effective\nbipartite XY spin Hamiltonians, with or without local and collective\ndissipation terms. This opens the door to the simulation of any bipartite spin\nor hard-core boson models and exploring dissipative phase transitions as the\ncompetition between coherent and incoherent exchange of excitations. We also\nshow that in the purely dissipative regime this model has a large number of\nexact and approximate dark states, whose structure and decay rates can be\nestimated analytically. We finally argue that this system may be used for the\nadiabatic preparation of boson sampling states encoded in the matter qubits.\n", "  An all optical implementation of pulse reconstruction using time-domain\nptychography is demonstrated showing excellent results. Setup and\nreconstruction are easy to implement and a number of drawbacks found in other\nsecond order techniques are removed, such as the beam splitter modifying the\npulse under consideration, the time ambiguity, or the strict correspondence\nbetween time delay increment and temporal resolution. Ptychography generally\nperforms superior to algorithms based on general projections, requires\nconsiderable less computational effort and is much less susceptible to noise.\n", "  The chirped-pulse interaction in the adiabatic coupling regime induces cyclic\npermutations of the energy states of a three-level system in the $V$-type\nconfiguration, which process is known as the three-level chirped rapid\nadiabatic passage. Here we show that a spectral hole in a chirped pulse can\nturn on and off one of the two adiabatic crossing points of this process,\nreducing the system to an effective two-level system. The given hybrid\nadiabatic-nonadiabatic transition results in selective excitation of the\nthree-level system, controlled by the laser intensity and spectral position of\nthe hole as well as the sign of the chirp parameter. Experiments are performed\nwith shaped femtosecond laser pulses and the three lowest energy-levels\n(5S$_{1/2}$, 5P$_{1/2}$, and 5P$_{3/2}$) of atomic rubidium ($^{85}$Rb), of\nwhich the result shows good agreement with the theoretically analyzed dynamics.\nThe result indicates that our method, being combined with the ordinary\nchirped-RAP, implements an adiabatic transitions between the two excited\nstates. Furthermore the laser intensity-dependent control may have applications\nincluding selective excitations of atoms or ions arranged in space when being\nused in conjunction with laser beam profile programming.\n", "  The feasibility studies of the central exclusive jet production at the LHC\nusing the proton tagging technique are presented. Three classes of data taking\nscenarios are considered: double tag at high pile-up, single tag at low pile-up\nand double tag at low pile-up. Analyses were performed at the c.m. energy of 14\nTeV for the ATLAS experiment, but are also valid for the CMS/TOTEM detectors.\n", "  Since the early days of experimental particle physics photomultipliers (PMTs)\nhave played an important role in the detector design. Thanks to their\ncapability of fast photon counting, PMTs are extensively used in the\nnew-generation of astroparticle physics experiments, such as air, ice and water\nCherenkov detectors. Small size PMTs ($\\leq $ 3 inches diameter) show little\nsensitivity to the Earth magnetic field, small transit time, stable transit\ntime spread; the price per photocathode area is less comparing to the one for\nthe large area PMTs, typically used so far in such applications. Together with\ndevelopments and reduced price of multichannel electronics, the use of PMTs of\n3-inches or smaller diameter is a promising option even for nowadays large\nvolume detectors.\n  In this paper we report on the design and performance of a new instrument for\nmass characterisation of PMTs (from 1 inch to 3 inches size), capable to\ncalibrate hundreds of PMTs per day and provide measurements of dark counts,\nsignal amplitude, late-, delayed-, pre- and after-pulses, transit time and\ntransit time spread.\n", "  The large level limit of the N=2 minimal models that appear in the duality\nwith the N=2 supersymmetric higher spin theory on AdS_3 is shown to be a\nnatural subsector of a certain symmetric orbifold theory. We study the relevant\ndecompositions in both the untwisted and the twisted sector, and analyse the\nstructure of the higher spin representations in the twisted sector in some\ndetail. These results should help to identify the string background of which\nthe higher spin theory is expected to describe the leading Regge trajectory in\nthe tensionless limit.\n", "  Fermions become polarized in a vorticular fluid due to spin-vorticity\ncoupling. Such a polarization can be calculated from the Wigner function in a\nquantum kinetic approach. Extending previous results for chiral fermions, we\nderive the Wigner function for massive fermions up to the next-to-leading order\nin spatial gradient expansion. The polarization density of fermions can be\ncalculated from the axial vector component of the Wigner function and is found\nto be proportional to the local vorticity $\\omega$. The polarizations per\nparticle for fermions and anti-fermions decrease with the chemical potential\nand increase with energy (mass). Both quantities approach the asymptotic value\n$\\hbar\\omega/4$ in the large energy (mass) limit. The polarization per particle\nfor fermions is always smaller than that for anti-fermions, whose ratio of\nfermions to anti-fermions also decreases with the chemical potential. The\npolarization per particle on the Cooper-Frye freeze-out hyper-surface can also\nbe formulated and is consistent with the previous result of Becattini et al..\n", "  We use single-cycle THz fields and the femtosecond magneto-optical Kerr\neffect to respectively excite and probe the magnetization dynamics in two\nthin-film ferromagnets with different lattice structure: crystalline Fe and\namorphous CoFeB. We observe Landau-Lifshitz-torque magnetization dynamics of\ncomparable magnitude in both systems, but only the amorphous sample shows\nultrafast demagnetization caused by the spin-lattice depolarization of the\nTHz-induced ultrafast spin current. Quantitative modelling shows that such\nspin-lattice scattering events occur on similar time scales than the\nconventional spin conserving electronic scattering ($\\sim30$ fs). This is\nsignificantly faster that optical laser-induced demagnetization. THz\nconductivity measurements point towards the influence of lattice disorder in\namorphous CoFeB as the driving force for enhanced spin-lattice scattering.\n", "  Undesirable electron field emission (a.k.a. dark current) in high gradient RF\nphotocathode guns deteriorates the quality of photoemission current and limits\nthe operational gradient. To improve the understanding of dark current\nemission, a high-resolution (~100 um) dark current imaging experiment has been\nperformed in an L-band photocathode gun operating at ~100 MV/m of surface\ngradient. Dark current from the cathode has been observed to be dominated by\nseveral separated strong emitters. The field enhancement factor, beta, of\nselected regions on the cathode has been measured. The post scanning electron\nmicroscopy (SEM) and white light interferometer (WLI) surface examinations\nreveal the origins of ~75% strong emitters overlap with the spots where rf\nbreakdown have occurred.\n", "  We study a coupled quintessence model with pure momentum exchange and present\nthe effects of such an interaction on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and\nmatter power spectrum. For a wide range of negative values of the coupling\nparameter $\\beta$ structure growth is suppressed and the model can reconcile\nthe tension between Cosmic Microwave Background observations and structure\ngrowth inferred from cluster counts. We find that this model is as good as\n$\\Lambda$CDM for CMB and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, while the\naddition of cluster data makes the model strongly preferred, improving the\nbest-fit $\\chi^2$-value by more than $16$.\n", "  The course of non-thermal electron ejection in relativistic unmagnetized\nelectron-ion shocks is investigated by performing self-consistent\nparticle-in-cell simulations. The shocks are excited through the injection of\nrelativistic jet into ambient plasma, leading to two distinct shocks (named as\nthe trailing shock and leading shock) and a contact discontinuity. The\nWeibel-like instabilities heat the electrons up to approximately half of ion\nkinetic energy. The double layers formed in the trailing and leading edges then\naccelerated the electrons by the ion kinetic energy. The electron distribution\nfunction in the leading edge shows a clear non-thermal power-law tail which\ncontains $\\sim1\\%$ of electrons and $\\sim8\\%$ of electron energy. Its power-law\nindex is -2.6. The acceleration efficiency is $\\sim23\\%$ by number and\n$\\sim50\\%$ by energy and the power-law index is -1.8 for electron distribution\nfunction in the trailing edge. The effect of the dimensionality is examined by\ncomparing results of 3D simulation with 2D ones. It exhibits that the electron\nacceleration is more efficient in 2D.\n", "  The light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) serve as important\nnon-perturbative inputs for the study of hard exclusive processes. In this\npaper, we calculate ten LCDAs at twist-2 for the S-wave and P-wave $B_c$ mesons\nup to the next-to-leading order (NLO) of the strong coupling $\\alpha_s$ and\nleading order of the velocity expansion. Each one of these ten LCDAs is\nexpressed as a product of a perturbatively calculable distribution and a\nuniversal NRQCD matrix-element. By use of the spin symmetry, only two NRQCD\nmatrix-elements will be involved. The reduction of the number of\nnon-perturbative inputs will improve the predictive power of collinear\nfactorization.\n", "  In developing photovoltaic devices with high efficiencies, quantitative\ndetermination of the carrier loss is crucial. In conventional solar-cell\ncharacterization techniques, however, photocurrent reduction originating from\nparasitic light absorption and carrier recombination within the light absorber\ncannot be assessed easily. Here, we develop a general analysis scheme in which\nthe optical and recombination losses in submicron-textured solar cells are\nevaluated systematically from external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra. In\nthis method, the optical absorption in solar cells is first deduced by imposing\nthe anti-reflection condition in the calculation of the absorptance spectrum,\nand the carrier extraction from the light absorber layer is then modeled by\nconsidering a carrier collection length from the absorber interface. Our\nanalysis method is appropriate for a wide variety of photovoltaic devices,\nincluding kesterite solar cells [Cu2ZnSnSe4, Cu2ZnSnS4, and Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4],\nzincblende CdTe solar cells, and hybrid perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) solar cells,\nand provides excellent fitting to numerous EQE spectra reported earlier. Based\non the results obtained from our EQE analyses, we discuss the effects of\nparasitic absorption and carrier recombination in different types of solar\ncells.\n", "  Stochastic effects in multi-field inflationary scenarios are investigated. A\nhierarchy of diffusion equations is derived, the solutions of which yield\nmoments of the numbers of inflationary $e$-folds. Solving the resulting partial\ndifferential equations in multi-dimensional field space is more challenging\nthan the single-field case. A few tractable examples are discussed, which show\nthat the number of fields is, in general, a critical parameter. When more than\ntwo fields are present for instance, the probability to explore arbitrarily\nlarge-field regions of the potential, otherwise inaccessible to single-field\ndynamics, becomes non-zero. In some configurations, this gives rise to an\ninfinite mean number of $e$-folds, regardless of the initial conditions.\nAnother difference with respect to single-field scenarios is that multi-field\nstochastic effects can be large even at sub-Planckian energy. This opens\ninteresting new possibilities for probing quantum effects in inflationary\ndynamics, since the moments of the numbers of $e$-folds can be used to\ncalculate the distribution of primordial density perturbations in the\nstochastic-$\\delta N$ formalism.\n", "  In high energy heavy ion collisions, the directed flow of particles is\nconventionally measured with respect to that of the projectile spectators,\nwhich is defined as positive $x$ direction. But it is not known if the\nspectators deflect in the \"outward\" direction or \"inward\" -- toward the center\nline of the collision. In this Letter we discuss how the measurements of the\ndirected flow at mid-rapidity, especially in asymmetric collision such as\nCu+Au, can be used to answer this question. We show that the existing data\nstrongly favor the case that the spectators, in the ultrarelativistic\ncollisions, on average deflect outwards.\n", "  We review models of new physics in which dark matter arises as a composite\nbound state from a confining strongly-coupled non-Abelian gauge theory. We\ndiscuss several qualitatively distinct classes of composite candidates,\nincluding dark mesons, dark baryons, and dark glueballs. We highlight some of\nthe promising strategies for direct detection, especially through dark moments,\nusing the symmetries and properties of the composite description to identify\nthe operators that dominate the interactions of dark matter with matter, as\nwell as dark matter self-interactions. We briefly discuss the implications of\nthese theories at colliders, especially the (potentially novel) phenomenology\nof dark mesons in various regimes of the models. Throughout the review, we\nhighlight the use of lattice calculations in the study of these\nstrongly-coupled theories, to obtain precise quantitative predictions and new\ninsights into the dynamics.\n", "  Estimation of quantum states is one of the most important steps in any\nquantum information processing experiment. A naive reconstruction of the\ndensity matrix from experimental measurements can often give density matrices\nwhich are not positive, and hence not physically acceptable. How do we ensure\nthat at all stages of reconstruction, we keep the density matrix positive and\nnormalized? Recently a method has been suggested based on maximum likelihood\nestimation, wherein the density matrix is guaranteed to be positive definite.\nWe experimentally implement this protocol and demonstrate its utility on an NMR\nquantum information processor. We discuss several examples where we undertake\nsuch an estimation and compare it with the standard method of state estimation.\n", "  We report the detection of near-IR H$_2$ lines emission from low-ionization\nstructures (LISs) in planetary nebulae. The deepest, high-angular resolution\nH$_2$ 1-0 S(1) at 2.122 $\\mu$m, and H$_2$ 2-1 S(1) at 2.248 $\\mu$m images of K\n4-47 and NGC 7662, obtained using NIRI@Gemini-North, are presented here. K 4-47\nreveals a remarkable high-collimated bipolar structure. The H$_2$ emission\nemanates from the walls of the bipolar outflows and a pair of knots at the tips\nof these outflows. The H$_2$ 1-0 S(1)/2-1 S(1) line ratio is $\\sim$7-10 which\nindicates shock interaction due to both the lateral expansion of the gas in the\noutflows and the high-velocity knots. The strongest line, H$_2$ v=1-0 S(1), is\nalso detected in several LISs located at the periphery of the outer shell of\nthe elliptical PN NGC 7662, whereas only four knots are detected in the H$_2$\nv=2-1 S(1) line. These knots have H$_2$ v=1-0 S(1)/v=2-1 S(1) values between 2\nand 3. These data confirm the presence of molecular gas in both highly (K 4-47)\nand slowly moving LISs (NGC 7662). The H$_2$ emission in K 4-47 is powered by\nshocks, whereas in NGC 7662 is due to photo-ionization by the central star.\nMoreover, a likely correlation is found between the H$_2$ v=1-0 S(1)/H$_2$\nv=2-1 S(1) and [N II]/H$\\alpha$ line ratios.\n", "  Multivalent particles competing for binding on the same surface can exhibit\nswitch-like behaviour, depending on the concentration of receptors on the\nsurface. When the receptor concentration is low, energy dominates the free\nenergy of binding, and particles having a small number of strongly-binding\nligands preferentially bind to the surface. At higher receptor concentrations,\nmultivalent effects become significant, and entropy dominates the binding free\nenergy; particles having many weakly-binding ligands preferentially bind to the\nsurface. Between these two regimes there is a \"switch-point\", at which the\nsurface binds the two species of particles equally strongly. We demonstrate\nthat a simple theory can account for this switch-like behaviour and present\nnumerical calculations that support the theoretical predictions. We argue that\nbinding selectivity based on receptor density, rather than identity, may have\npractical applications.\n", "  In the light of the most recent data from Higgs boson searches and analyses,\nwe re-assess the scope of the Large Hadron Collider in accessing heavy charged\nHiggs boson signals in $b\\bar b W^\\pm$ final states, wherein the contributing\nchannels can be $H^+\\to t\\bar b$, $hW^\\pm, HW^\\pm$ and $AW^\\pm$. We consider a\n2-Higgs Doublet Model Type-II and we assume as production mode $bg\\to tH^-$ +\nc.c., the dominant one over the range $M_{H^\\pm}\\ge 480$ GeV, as dictated by\n$b\\to s\\gamma$ constraints. Prospects of detection are found to be significant\nfor various Run 2 energy and luminosity options.\n", "  We discuss the physics of the high temperature superconductivity in hole\ndoped copper oxide ceramics in the pseudogap region. Starting from an effective\nreduced Hamiltonian relevant to the dynamics of holes injected into the copper\noxide layers proposed in a previous paper, we determine the superconductive\ncondensate wavefunction. We show that the low-lying elementary condensate\nexcitations are analogous to the rotons in superfluid $^4He$. We argue that the\nrotons-like excitations account for the specific heat anomaly at the critical\ntemperature. We discuss and compare with experimental observations the London\npenetration length, the Abrikosov vortices, the upper and lower critical\nmagnetic fields, and the critical current density. We give arguments to explain\nthe origin of the Fermi arcs and Fermi pockets. We investigate the nodal gap in\nthe cuprate superconductors and discuss both the doping and temperature\ndependence of the nodal gap. We suggest that the nodal gap is responsible for\nthe doping dependence of the so-called nodal Fermi velocity detected in angle\nresolved photoemission spectroscopy studies. We discuss the thermodynamics of\nthe nodal quasielectron liquid and their role in the low temperature specific\nheat. We propose that the ubiquitous presence of charge density wave in hole\ndoped cuprate superconductors in the pseudogap region originates from\ninstabilities of the nodal quasielectrons driven by the interaction with the\nplanar $CuO_2$ lattice. We investigate the doping dependence of the charge\ndensity wave gap and the competition between charge order and\nsuperconductivity. We discuss the effects of external magnetic fields on the\ncharge density wave gap and elucidate the interplay between charge density wave\nand Abrikosov vortices. Finally, we examine the physics underlying quantum\noscillations in the pseudogap region.\n", "  We propose a procedure to analyze the relation between the exact\nfactorization of the electron-nuclear wave function and the Born-Oppenheimer\napproximation. We define the adiabatic limit as the limit of infinite nuclear\nmass. To this end, we introduce a unit system that singles out the dependence\non the electron-nuclear mass ratio of each term appearing in the equations of\nthe exact factorization. We observe how non-adiabatic effects induced by the\ncoupling to the nuclear motion affect electronic properties and we analyze the\nleading term, connecting it to the classical nuclear momentum. Its dependence\non the mass ratio is tested numerically on a model proton- coupled electron\ntransfer in different non-adiabatic regimes.\n", "  We present a semiclassical two-step model for strong-field ionization that\naccounts for path interferences of tunnel-ionized electrons in the ionic\npotential beyond perturbation theory. Within the framework of a classical\ntrajectory Monte-Carlo representation of the phase-space dynamics, the model\nemploys the semiclassical approximation to the phase of the full quantum\npropagator in the exit channel. By comparison with the exact numerical solution\nof the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation for strong-field ionization of\nhydrogen, we show that for suitable choices of the momentum distribution after\nthe first tunneling step, the model yields good quantitative agreement with the\nfull quantum simulation. The two-dimensional photoelectron momentum\ndistributions, the energy spectra, and the angular distributions are found to\nbe in good agreement with the corresponding quantum results. Specifically, the\nmodel quantitatively reproduces the fan-like interference patterns in the\nlow-energy part of the two-dimensional momentum distributions as well as the\nmodulations in the photoelectron angular distributions.\n", "  Frequency comb assisted diode laser spectroscopy, employing both the accuracy\nof an optical frequency comb and the broad wavelength tuning range of a tunable\ndiode laser, has been widely used in many applications. In this letter we\npresent a novel method using cascaded frequency agile diode lasers, which\nallows extending the measurement bandwidth to 37.4 THz (1355 to 1630 nm) at MHz\nresolution with scanning speeds above 1 THz/s. It is demonstrated as a useful\ntool to characterize a broadband spectrum for molecular spectroscopy and in\nparticular it enables to characterize the dispersion of integrated\nmicroresonators up to the fourth order.\n", "  We report on the temperature and layer thickness variation of spin-orbit\ntorques in perpendicularly magnetized W/CoFeB bilayers. Harmonic Hall voltage\nmeasurements reveal dissimilar temperature evolutions of longitudinal and\ntransverse effective magnetic field components. The transverse effective field\nchanges sign at 250 K for a 2 nm thick W buffer layer, indicating a much\nstronger contribution from interface spin-orbit interactions compared to, for\nexample, Ta. Transmission electron microscopy measurements reveal that\nconsiderable interface mixing between W and CoFeB is primarily responsible for\nthis effect.\n", "  This paper employs the theoretical framework developed by Luhar et al. (J.\nFluid Mech., 768, 415-441) to consider the design of compliant walls for\nturbulent skin friction reduction. Specifically, the effects of simple\nspring-damper walls are contrasted with the effects of more complex walls\nincorporating tension, stiffness and anisotropy. In addition, varying mass\nratios are tested to provide insight into differences between aerodynamic and\nhydrodynamic applications. Despite the differing physical responses, all the\nwalls tested exhibit some important common features. First, the effect of the\nwalls (positive or negative) is greatest at conditions close to resonance, with\nsharp transitions in performance across the resonant frequency or phase speed.\nSecond, compliant walls are predicted to have a more pronounced effect on\nslower-moving structures because such structures generally have larger\nwall-pressure signatures. Third, two-dimensional (spanwise constant) structures\nare particularly susceptible to further amplification. These features are\nconsistent with many previous experiments and simulations, suggesting that\nmitigating the rise of such two-dimensional structures is essential to\ndesigning performance-improving walls. For instance, it is shown that further\namplification of such large-scale two-dimensional structures explains why the\noptimal anisotropic walls identified by Fukagata et al. via DNS (J. Turb., 9,\n1-17) only led to drag reduction in very small domains. The above observations\nare used to develop design and methodology guidelines for future research on\ncompliant walls.\n", "  Half-Heusler (HH) phases (space group F43m, Clb) are increasingly gaining\nattention as promising thermoelectric materials in view of their thermal\nstability, scalability, and environmental benignity as well as efficient power\noutput. Until recently, the verifiable dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) of HH\nphases has remained moderate near 1, which limits the power conversion\nefficiency of these materials. We report herein ZT~1.3 in n-type (Hf,Zr)NiSn\nalloys near 850 K developed through elemental substitution and simultaneously\nembedment of nanoparticles in the HH matrix, obtained by annealing the samples\nclose to their melting temperatures. Introduction of mass fluctuation and\nscattering centers play a key role in the high ZT measured, as shown by the\nreduction of thermal conductivity and increase of thermopower. Based on\ncomputation, the power conversion efficiency of a n-p couple module based on\nthe new n-type (Hf,Zr,Ti)NiSn particles-in-matrix composite and recently\nreported high-ZT p-type HH phases is expected to reach 13%, comparable to that\nof state-of-the-art materials, but with the mentioned additional materials and\nenvironmental attributes. Since the high efficiency is obtained without tuning\nthe microstructure of the Half-Heusler phases, it leaves room for further\noptimization.\n", "  The gauge/gravity duality provides us with nonperturbative formulation of\nsuperstring/M-theory. Although inputs from gauge theory side are crucial for\nanswering many deep questions associated with quantum gravitational aspects of\nsuperstring/M-theory, many of the important problems have evaded analytic\napproaches. For them, lattice gauge theory is the only hope at this moment. In\nthis review I give a list of such problems, putting emphasis on problems within\nreach in a five-year span, including both Euclidean and real-time simulations.\n", "  Hot subdwarf stars (sdO/Bs) are evolved core helium-burning stars with very\nthin hydrogen envelopes, which can be formed by common envelope ejection. Close\nsdB binaries with massive white dwarf (WD) companions are potential progenitors\nof thermonuclear supernovae type Ia (SN Ia). We discovered such a progenitor\ncandidate as well as a candidate for a surviving companion star, which escapes\nfrom the Galaxy. More candidates for both types of objects have been found by\ncrossmatching known sdB stars with proper motion and light curve catalogues.\nThe Gaia mission will provide accurate astrometry and light curves of all the\nstars in our hot subdwarf sample and will allow us to compile a much larger\nall-sky catalogue of those stars. In this way we expect to find hundreds of\nprogenitor binaries and ejected companions.\n", "  We study N = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories with gauge group SU(2) coupled\nto fundamental flavours, covering all asymptotically free and conformal cases.\nWe re-derive, from the conformal field theory perspective, the differential\nequations satisfied by omega deformed instanton partition functions. We confirm\ntheir validity at leading order in one of the deformation parameters via a\nsaddle-point analysis of the partition function. In the semi-classical limit we\nshow that these differential equations take a form amenable to exact WKB\nanalysis. We compute the monodromy group associated to the differential\nequations in terms of deformed and Borel resummed Seiberg-Witten data. For each\ncase, we study pairs of Stokes graphs that are related by flips and pops, and\nshow that the monodromy groups allow one to confirm the Stokes automorphisms\nthat arise as the phase of the deformation parameter is varied. Finally, we\nrelate the Borel resummed monodromies with the traditional Seiberg-Witten\nvariables in the semi-classical limit.\n", "  A large effort has been carried out to characterize the background of sodium\niodide crystals within the ANAIS (Annual modulation with NaI Scintillators)\nproject. In this paper, the background models developed for three 12.5-kg\nNaI(Tl) scintillators produced by Alpha Spectra Inc. and operated at the\nCanfranc Underground Laboratory are presented together with an evaluation of\nthe background prospects for the full experiment. Measured spectra from\nthreshold to high energy in different conditions are well described by the\nmodels based on quantified activities. At the region of interest, crystal bulk\ncontamination is the dominant background source. Contributions from 210Pb, 40K,\n22Na and 3H are the most relevant. Those from 40K and 22Na could be efficiently\nsuppressed thanks to anticoincidence operation in a crystals matrix or inside a\nLiquid Scintillator Veto (LSV), while that from 210Pb has been reduced by\nimproving crystal production methods and 3H production could be reduced by\nshielding against cosmic rays during production. Assuming the activities of the\nlast characterized detector, for nine crystals with a total mass of 112.5 kg\nthe expected background rate is 2.5 counts/(keV kg d) in the region from 1 to 4\nkeV, which could be reduced at 1.4 counts/(keV kg d) by using a LSV.\n", "  The $I=1$ $p$-wave and $I=2$ $s$-wave elastic $\\pi$-$\\pi$ scattering\namplitudes are calculated from a first-principles lattice QCD simulation using\na single ensemble of gauge field configurations with $N_{\\mathrm{f}} = 2+1$\ndynamical flavors of anisotropic clover-improved Wilson fermions. This ensemble\nhas a large spatial volume $V=(3.7\\mathrm{fm})^3$, pion mass $m_{\\pi} =\n230\\mathrm{MeV}$, and spatial lattice spacing $a_s = 0.11\\mathrm{fm}$.\nCalculation of the necessary temporal correlation matrices is efficiently\nperformed using the stochastic LapH method, while the large volume enables an\nimproved energy resolution compared to previous work. For this single ensemble\nwe obtain $m_{\\rho}/m_{\\pi} = 3.350(24)$, $g_{\\rho\\pi\\pi} = 5.99(26)$, and a\nclear signal for the $I=2$ $s$-wave. The success of the stochastic LapH method\nin this proof-of-principle large-volume calculation paves the way for\nquantitative study of the lattice spacing effects and quark mass dependence of\nscattering amplitudes using state-of-the-art ensembles.\n", "  The data sample of $\\Lambda_b^0\\to J/\\psi p K^-$ decays acquired with the\nLHCb detector from 7 and 8~TeV $pp$ collisions, corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 3 fb$^{-1}$, is inspected for the presence of $J/\\psi p$ or\n$J/\\psi K^-$ contributions with minimal assumptions about $K^- p$\ncontributions. It is demonstrated at more than 9 standard deviations that\n$\\Lambda_b^0\\to J/\\psi p K^-$ decays cannot be described with $K^- p$\ncontributions alone, and that $J/\\psi p$ contributions play a dominant role in\nthis incompatibility. These model-independent results support the previously\nobtained model-dependent evidence for $P_c^+\\to J/\\psi p$ charmonium-pentaquark\nstates in the same data sample.\n", "  We study a U(N) gauged matrix quantum mechanics which, in the large N limit,\nis closely related to the chiral WZW conformal field theory. This manifests\nitself in two ways. First, we construct the left-moving Kac-Moody algebra from\nmatrix degrees of freedom. Secondly, we compute the partition function of the\nmatrix model in terms of Schur and Kostka polynomials and show that, in the\nlarge $N$ limit, it coincides with the partition function of the WZW model.\nThis same matrix model was recently shown to describe non-Abelian quantum Hall\nstates and the relationship to the WZW model can be understood in this\nframework.\n", "  We discuss the minimum value of the zero-bias differential conductance\n$G_{\\textrm{min}}$ in a junction consisting of a normal metal and a nodal\nsuperconductor preserving time-reversal symmetry. Using the quasiclassical\nGreen function method, we show that $G_{\\textrm{min}}$ is quantized at $\n(4e^2/h) N_{\\mathrm{ZES}}$ in the limit of strong impurity scatterings in the\nnormal metal. The integer $N_{\\mathrm{ZES}}$ represents the number of perfect\ntransmission channels through the junction. An analysis of the chiral symmetry\nof the Hamiltonian indicates that $N_{\\mathrm{ZES}}$ corresponds to the\nAtiyah-Singer index in mathematics.\n", "  We discuss the cosmological constant problem using the properties of a\nfreely-suspended two-dimensional condensed-matter film, i.e., an explicit\nrealization of a 2D brane. The large contributions of vacuum fluctuations to\nthe surface tension of this film are cancelled in equilibrium by the\nthermodynamic potential arising from the conservation law for particle number.\nIn short, the surface tension of the film vanishes in equilibrium due to a\nthermodynamic identity. This 2D brane can be generalized to a 4D brane with\ngravity. For the 4D brane, the analogue of the 2D surface tension is the 4D\ncosmological constant, which is also nullified in full equilibrium. The 4D\nbrane theory provides an alternative description of the phenomenological\n$q$-theory of the quantum vacuum. As for other realizations of the vacuum\nvariable $q$, such as the 4-form field-strength realization, the main\ningredient is the conservation law for the variable $q$, which makes the vacuum\na self-sustained system. For a vacuum within this class, the nullification of\nthe cosmological constant takes place automatically in equilibrium. Out of\nequilibrium, the cosmological constant can be as large as suggested by naive\nestimates based on the summation of zero-point energies. In this brane\ndescription, $q$-theory also corresponds to a generalization of unimodular\ngravity.\n", "  We show that there exists a special compactification of QCD on $\\mathbb{R}^3\n\\times S^1$ in which the theory has a domain where continuous chiral symmetry\nbreaking is analytically calculable. We give a microscopic derivation of the\nchiral lagrangian, the chiral condensate, and the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner\nrelation $m_{\\pi}^2 f_{\\pi}^2 = m_q \\langle \\bar{q} q \\rangle$. Abelian\nduality, monopole operators, and flavor-twisted boundary conditions, or a\nbackground flavor holonomy, play the main roles. The flavor twisting leads to\nthe new effect of fractional jumping of fermion zero modes among\nmonopole-instantons. Chiral symmetry breaking is induced by monopole-instanton\noperators, and the Nambu-Goldstone pions arise by color-flavor transmutation\nfrom gapless \"dual photons\". We also give a microscopic picture of the\n\"constituent quark\" masses. Our results are consistent with expectations from\nchiral perturbation theory at large $S^1$, and yield strong support for\nadiabatic continuity between the small-$S^1$ and large-$S^1$ regimes. We also\nfind concrete microscopic connections between ${\\cal N}=1$ and ${\\cal N}=2$\nsupersymmetric gauge theory dynamics and non-supersymmetric QCD dynamics.\n", "  We consider a charged scalar particle $\\chi$ of mass around 375 GeV charged\nunder both $SU(3)_c$ and a new confining non-abelian gauge interaction. After\npair production, these interactions confine the exotic scalar into\nnon-relativistic bound states whose decays into photons can explain the 750 GeV\ndiphoton excess observed at the LHC. Taking the new confining group to be\n$\\mathrm{SU}(2)$, we find $\\chi$ must carry an electric charge of $Q \\sim\n[\\frac{1}{2}, 1]$ to fit the data. Interestingly, we find that pair production\nof the scalars and the subsequent formation of the bound state dominates over\ndirect bound state resonance production. This explanation is quite weakly\nconstrained by current searches and data from the forthcoming run at the LHC\nwill be able to probe our scenario more fully. In particular dijet, mono-jet,\ndi-Higgs and jet + photon searches may be the most promising discovery\nchannels.\n", "  We present a simplified method for the extraction of meaningful signals from\nHanford and Livingstone 32 seconds data for the GW150914 event made publicly\navailable by the LIGO collaboration and demonstrate its ability to reproduce\nthe LIGO collaboration's own results quantitatively given the assumption that\nall narrow peaks in the power spectrum are a consequence of physically\nuninteresting signals and can be removed. After the clipping of these peaks and\nreturn to the time domain, the GW150914 event is readily distinguished from\nbroadband background noise. This simple technique allows us to identify the\nGW150914 event without any assumption regarding its physical origin and with\nminimal assumptions regarding its shape. We also confirm that the LIGO GW150914\nevent is uniquely correlated in the Hanford and Livingston detectors for 4096\nsecond data at the level of $6-7\\,\\sigma$ with a temporal displacement of\n$\\tau=6.9 \\pm 0.4\\,$ms. We have also identified a few events that are\nmorphologically close to GW150914 but less strongly cross correlated with it.\n", "  If the 750 GeV resonance in the diphoton channel is confirmed, what are the\nmeasurements necessary to infer the properties of the new particle and\nunderstand its nature? We address this question in the framework of a single\nnew scalar particle, called digamma ($\\digamma$). We describe it by an\neffective field theory, which allows us to obtain general and model-independent\nresults, and to identify the most useful observables, whose relevance will\nremain also in model-by-model analyses. We derive full expressions for the\nleading-order processes and compute rates for higher-order decays, digamma\nproduction in association with jets, gauge or Higgs bosons, and digamma pair\nproduction. We illustrate how measurements of these higher-order processes can\nbe used to extract couplings, quantum numbers, and properties of the new\nparticle.\n", "  A single-order transmission diffraction grating based on dispersion\nengineered all-dielectric metasurfaces is proposed and its wavelength\ndiscriminating properties have been theoretically described and confirmed using\nnumerical simulations. The metasurface is designed using a 2D array of\nall-dielectric resonators, which emulates a Huygens source configuration to\nachieve a perfect match to free-space in broad bandwidth. Using a holey\ndielectric nanodisk structure as the unit cell, the resonant wavelength is\ntapered across the metasurface to engineer the wavelength dependent spatial\nphase gradient, to emulate a dispersive prism. Consequently, different\nwavelengths are steered towards different directions and thus are discriminated\non the output image plane. Due to subwavelength periodicities involved, the\nwavelength discrimination is achieved directly in the zeroth diffraction order\nof the device, unlike conventional diffraction gratings, thereby providing a\nhigh efficiency wavelength discriminating device.\n", "  We study the transport, decoherence and dissipation of an impurity\ninteracting with a bath of free fermions in a one-dimensional lattice.\nNumerical simulations are made with the time-evolving block decimation method.\nWe introduce a mass imbalance between the impurity and bath particles and find\nthat the fastest decoherence occurs for a light impurity in a bath of heavy\nparticles. By contrast, the fastest dissipation of energy occurs when the\nmasses are equal. We present a simple model for decoherence in the heavy bath\nlimit, and a linear density response description of the interaction which\npredicts maximum dissipation for equal masses.\n", "  We investigate the impact of pairing correlations on neutrino transport in\nstellar matter. Our analysis is extended to nuclear matter conditions where\nlarge density fluctuations develop, associated with the onset of the\nliquid-vapor phase transition, and clustering phenomena occur. Within a\nthermodynamical treatment, we show that at moderate temperatures, where pairing\neffects are still active, the scattering of neutrinos in the nuclear medium is\nsignificantly affected by pairing correlations, which increase the neutrino\ntrapping, thus modifying the cooling mechanism, by neutrino emission, of\nneutron stars.\n", "  Room temperature strong coupling of WS_2 monolayer exciton transitions to\nmetallic Fabry-Perot and plasmonic optical cavities is demonstrated. A Rabi\nsplitting of 101 meV is observed for the Fabry-Perot cavity, more than double\nthose reported to date in other 2D materials. The enhanced magnitude and\nvisibility of WS_2 monolayer strong coupling is attributed to the larger\nabsorption coefficient, the narrower linewidth of the A exciton transition, and\ngreater spin-orbit coupling. For WS_2 coupled to plasmonic arrays, the Rabi\nsplitting still reaches 60 meV despite the less favorable coupling conditions,\nand displays interesting photoluminescence features. The unambiguous signature\nof WS_2 monolayer strong coupling in easily fabricated metallic resonators at\nroom temperature suggests many possibilities for combining light-matter\nhybridization with spin and valleytronics.\n", "  We introduce a mesocopic modeling approach for active systems. The continuum\nmodel allows to consider microscopic details as well as emerging macroscopic\nbehavior and can be considered as a minimal continuum model to describe generic\nproperties of active systems with isotropic agents. The model combines aspects\nfrom phase field crystal (PFC) models and Toner-Tu models. The results are\nvalidated by reproducing results obtained with corresponding agent-based\nmicroscopic models. We consider binary collisions, collective motion and vortex\nformation. For larger numbers of particles we analyze the coarsening process in\nactive crystals and identify giant number fluctuation in the cluster formation\nprocess.\n", "  The momentum transfer dependence of the magnetic form factor associated with\nthe quasielastic spectral component in the dynamic magnetic response of\nintermediate valence SmB$_{6}$ has been measured using inelastic neutron\nscattering on a double-isotope ($^{154}$Sm, $^{11}$B) single crystal. The\nexperimental dependence differs qualitatively from those obtained earlier for\nthe inelastic signals, as well as from the field-induced magnetic form factor\nof SmB$_{6}$ obtained by polarized neutron diffraction. This observation is\ninterpreted by specifically considering the Curie-type contributions to the\ndynamic susceptibility, which arise from the mixing of 4f$^{5}$ and 4f$^{6}$\nJ-multiplets into the intermediate valence state wave function.\n", "  The basic equations of physics involve a time variable t and are invariant\nunder the transformation $t goes to -t$. This invariance at first sight appears\nto impose time reversibility as a principle of physics, in conflict with\nthermodynamics. But equations written on the blackboard are not the whole story\nin physics. In prior work we sharpened a distinction obscured in today's\ntheoretical physics, the distinction between obtaining evidence from\nexperiments on the laboratory bench and explaining that evidence in\nmathematical symbols on the blackboard. The sharp distinction rests on a proof\nwithin the mathematics of quantum theory that no amount of evidence,\nrepresented in quantum theory in terms of probabilities, can uniquely determine\nits explanation in terms of wave functions and linear operators. Building on\nthe proof we show here a role in physics for unpredictable symbol-handling\nagents acting both at the blackboard and at the workbench, communicating back\nand forth by means of transmitted symbols. Because of their unpredictability,\nsymbol-handling agents introduce a heretofore overlooked source of\nirreversibility into physics, even when the equations they write on the\nblackboard are invariant under t goes to -t$. Widening the scope of\ndescriptions admissible to physics to include the agents and the symbols that\nlink theory to experiments opens up a new source of time-irreversibility in\nphysics.\n", "  It has been realised that corners in entangling surfaces can induce new\nuniversal contributions to the entanglement entropy and R\\'enyi entropy. In\nthis paper we study universal corner contributions to entanglement negativity\nin three- and four-dimensional CFTs using both field theory and holographic\ntechniques. We focus on the quantity $\\chi$ defined by the ratio of the\nuniversal part of the entanglement negativity over that of the entanglement\nentropy, which may characterise the amount of distillable entanglement. We find\nthat for most of the examples $\\chi$ takes bigger values for singular\nentangling regions, which may suggest increase in distillable entanglement.\nHowever, there also exist counterexamples where distillable entanglement\ndecreases for singular surfaces. We also explore the behaviour of $\\chi$ as the\ncoupling varies and observe that for singular entangling surfaces, the amount\nof distillable entanglement is mostly largest for free theories, while\ncounterexample exists for free Dirac fermion in three dimensions. For\nholographic CFTs described by higher derivative gravity, $\\chi$ may increase or\ndecrease, depending on the sign of the relevant parameters. Our results may\nreveal a more profound connection between geometry and distillable\nentanglement.\n", "  In a previous article we suggested a method to overcome the diffraction limit\nbehind a telescope. We refer to theory and recent numerical simulations, and\ntest whether it is indeed possible to use photon amplification to enhance the\nangular resolution of a telescope or a microscope beyond the diffraction limit.\nAn essential addition is the proposal to select events with above-average ratio\nof stimulated to spontaneous photons. We find that the diffraction limit of a\ntelescope is surpassed by a factor ten for an amplifier gain of 200, if the\nanalysis is restricted to a tenth of the incoming astronomical photons. A gain\nof 70 is sufficient with a hundredth of the photons.\n", "  Coherent conversion of photons to magnons, and back, provides a natural\nmechanism for rapid control of interactions between stationary spins with long\ncoherence times and high-speed photons. Despite the large frequency difference\nbetween optical photons and magnons, coherent conversion can be achieved\nthrough a three-particle interaction between one magnon and two photons whose\nfrequency difference is resonant with the magnon frequency, as in optomechanics\nwith two photons and a phonon. The large spin density of a transparent\nferromagnetic insulator (such as the ferrite yttrium iron garnet) in an optical\ncavity provides an intrinsic photon-magnon coupling strength that we calculate\nto exceed reported optomechanical couplings. A large cavity photon number and\nproperly selected cavity detuning produce a predicted effective coupling\nstrength sufficient for observing electromagnetically induced transparency and\nthe Purcell effect, and even to reach the ultra-strong coupling regime.\n", "  It has recently been proposed that electronic band structures in crystals\ngive rise to a previously overlooked type of Weyl fermion, which violates\nLorentz invariance and, consequently, is forbidden in particle physics. It was\nfurther predicted that Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ may realize such a Type II Weyl\nfermion. One crucial challenge is that the Weyl points in Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$\nare predicted to lie above the Fermi level. Here, by studying a simple model\nfor a Type II Weyl cone, we clarify the importance of accessing the unoccupied\nband structure to demonstrate that Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ is a Weyl semimetal.\nThen, we use pump-probe angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (pump-probe\nARPES) to directly observe the unoccupied band structure of\nMo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$. For the first time, we directly access states $> 0.2$ eV\nabove the Fermi level. By comparing our results with $\\textit{ab initio}$\ncalculations, we conclude that we directly observe the surface state containing\nthe topological Fermi arc. Our work opens the way to studying the unoccupied\nband structure as well as the time-domain relaxation dynamics of\nMo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ and related transition metal dichalcogenides.\n", "  In a previous letter (arXiv:1306.2287) we determined the isospin mass\nsplittings of the baryon octet from a lattice calculation based on quenched QED\nand $N_f{=}2{+}1$ QCD simulations with 5 lattice spacings down to\n$0.054~\\mathrm{fm}$, lattice sizes up to $6~\\mathrm{fm}$ and average up-down\nquark masses all the way down to their physical value. Using the same data we\ndetermine here the corrections to Dashen's theorem and the individual up and\ndown quark masses. For the parameter which quantifies violations to Dashens's\ntheorem, we obtain $\\epsilon=0.73(2)(5)(17)$, where the first error is\nstatistical, the second is systematic, and the third is an estimate of the QED\nquenching error. For the light quark masses we obtain,\n$m_u=2.27(6)(5)(4)~\\mathrm{MeV}$ and $m_d=4.67(6)(5)(4)~\\mathrm{MeV}$ in the\n$\\bar{\\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme at $2~\\mathrm{GeV}$ and the isospin breaking ratios\n$m_u/m_d=0.485(11)(8)(14)$, $R=38.2(1.1)(0.8)(1.4)$ and\n$Q=23.4(0.4)(0.3)(0.4)$. Our results exclude the $m_u=0$ solution to the strong\nCP problem by more than $24$ standard deviations.\n", "  Data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor satellite observatory suggested\nthat the recently discovered gravitational wave source, a pair of two\ncoalescing black holes, was related to a gamma-ray burst. The observed\nhigh-energy electromagnetic radiation (above 50 keV) originated from a weak\ntransient source and lasted for about 1 second. Its localization is consistent\nwith the direction to GW150914. We speculate about the possible scenario for\nthe formation of a gamma-ray burst accompanied by the gravitational-wave\nsignal. Our model invokes a tight binary system consisting of a massive star\nand a black hole which leads to the triggering of a collapse of the star's\nnucleus, the formation of a second black hole, and finally to the binary black\nhole merger. For the most-likely configuration of the binary spin vectors with\nrespect to the orbital angular momentum in the GW150914 event, the recoil speed\n(kick velocity) acquired by the final black hole through gravitational wave\nemission is of the order of a few hundred km/s and this might be sufficient to\nget it closer to the envelope of surrounding material and capture a small\nfraction of matter from the remnant of the host star. The gamma-ray burst is\nproduced by the accretion of this remnant matter onto the final black hole. The\nmoderate spin of the final black hole suggests that the gamma-ray burst jet is\npowered by weak neutrino emission rather than the Blandford-Znajek mechanism,\nand hence explains the low power available for the observed GRB signal.\n", "  We show that the 750 GeV diphoton excess can be explained by introducing\nvector-like quarks and hidden fermions charged under a hidden U(1) gauge\nsymmetry, which has a relatively large coupling constant as well as a\nsignificant kinetic mixing with U(1)$_Y$. With the large kinetic mixing, the\nstandard model gauge couplings unify around $10^{17}$ GeV, suggesting the grand\nunified theory without too rapid proton decay. Our scenario predicts events\nwith a photon and missing transverse momentum, and its cross section is related\nto that for the diphoton excess through the kinetic mixing. We also discuss\nother possible collider signatures and cosmology, including various ways to\nevade constraints on exotic stable charged particles. In some cases where the\n750 GeV diphoton excess is due to diaxion decays, our scenario also predicts\ntriphoton and tetraphoton signals.\n", "  We present a preliminary study of both Single and Double Parton Scattering\ncontributions to the inclusive 4-jet production in the kt-factorization\nframework at Leading Order and $E_{CM} = 7$ TeV. We compare our results to\ncollinear results in the literature and to the ATLAS and CMS data at 8 and 7\nTeV respectively. We also discuss the importance of double parton scattering\nfor relatively soft cuts on the jet transverse momenta and find out that\nsymmetric cuts do not quite suit well to kt-factorization predictions, because\nof a kinematic effect suppressing the double parton scattering contribution.\n", "  We present a modified $8f$ geometry for time domain terahertz (THz)\nspectroscopy (TDTS) experiments. We show, through simulations and data, that a\nsimple rearranging of the off-axis parabolic mirrors, which are typically used\nto focus and direct THz radiation in TDTS experiments, results in a nearly 40%\nreduction in the THz focal spot diameter. This effect stems from significant\nreduction of the principle optical aberrations which are enhanced in the\nconventional $8f$ geometry but partially compensated in the modified $8f$\nexperimental setup. We compare data from our home-built TDTS spectrometer in\nthe modified $8f$ geometry to that of previous iterations that were designed in\nthe conventional $8f$ geometry to demonstrate the effect.\n", "  A numerical method to solve the TDHFB equations by using a hybrid basis of\nthe two-dimensional harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions and one-dimensional\nLagrange mesh with the Gogny effective interaction is applied to the head-on\ncollisions of the superfluid nuclei ${}^{20}$O's. Taking the energies around\nthe barrier top energy, the trajectories, pairing energies, and numbers of\ntransferred nucleons are displayed. Their dependence on the relative gauge\nangle at the initial time is studied by taking typical sample points of the\ngauge angle. It turned out that the functional form of the flux of the neutrons\nacross a section plane is proportional to the sine of the two times of the\ngauge angle.\n", "  We present a number of explicit calculations of Renyi and entanglement\nentropies in situations where the entangling surface intersects the boundary in\n$d$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. When the boundary is a single plane we\ncompute the contribution to the entropy due to this intersection, first in the\ncase of the Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions, and then in the case of\na generic Robin type boundary condition. The flow in the boundary coupling\nbetween the Neumann and Dirichlet phases is analyzed in arbitrary dimension $d$\nand is shown to be monotonic, the peculiarity of $d=3$ case is noted. We argue\nthat the translational symmetry along the entangling surface is broken due the\npresence of the boundary which reveals that the entanglement is not\nhomogeneous. In order to characterize this quantitatively, we introduce a\ndensity of entanglement entropy and compute it explicitly. This quantity\nclearly indicates that the entanglement is maximal near the boundary. We then\nconsider the situation where the boundary is composed of two parallel planes at\na finite separation and compute the entanglement entropy as well as its density\nin this case. The complete contribution to entanglement entropy due to the\nboundaries is shown not to depend on the distance between the planes and is\nsimply twice the entropy in the case of single plane boundary. Additionally, we\nfind how the area law, the part in the entropy proportional to the area of\nentire entangling surface, depends on the size of the separation between the\ntwo boundaries. The latter is shown to appear in the UV finite part of the\nentropy.\n", "  We present a functional renormalization group approach for the active to\ninactive phase transition in directed percolation type systems, in which the\ntransition is approached from the active, finite density phase. By expanding\nthe effective potential for the density field around its minimum, we obtain a\nbackground field action functional, which serves as a starting point for the\nfunctional renormalization group approach. Due to the presence of the\nbackground field, the corresponding non-perturbative flow equations yield\nremarkably good estimates for the critical exponents of the directed\npercolation universality class, even in low dimensions.\n", "  We propose and demonstrate a laser frequency stabilization scheme which\ngenerates a dispersion-like tunable Doppler-free dichroic lock (TDFDL) signal.\nThis signal offers a wide tuning range for lock point (i.e. zero-crossing)\nwithout compromising on the slope of the locking signal. The method involves\nmeasurement of magnetically induced dichroism in an atomic vapour for a weak\nprobe laser beam in presence of a counter propagating strong pump laser beam. A\nsimple model is presented to explain the basic principles of this method to\ngenerate the TDFDL signal. The spectral shift in the locking signal is achieved\nby tuning the frequency of the pump beam. The TDFDL signal is shown to be\nuseful for locking the frequency of a cooling laser used for magneto-optcal\ntrap (MOT) for $^{87}Rb$ atoms.\n", "  Recently, the complex Langevin method has been applied successfully to finite\ndensity QCD either in the deconfinement phase or in the heavy dense limit with\nthe aid of a new technique called the gauge cooling. In the confinement phase\nwith light quarks, however, convergence to wrong limits occurs due to the\nsingularity in the drift term caused by small eigenvalues of the Dirac operator\nincluding the mass term. We propose that this singular-drift problem should\nalso be overcome by the gauge cooling with different criteria for choosing the\ncomplexified gauge transformation. The idea is tested in chiral Random Matrix\nTheory for finite density QCD, where exact results are reproduced at zero\ntemperature with light quarks. It is shown that the gauge cooling indeed\nchanges drastically the eigenvalue distribution of the Dirac operator measured\nduring the Langevin process. Despite its non-holomorphic nature, this\neigenvalue distribution has a universal diverging behavior at the origin in the\nchiral limit due to a generalized Banks-Casher relation as we confirm\nexplicitly.\n", "  We present the results of VLA, ATCA, and Swift XRT observations of the 2015\noutburst of the transient neutron star X-ray binary (NSXB), EXO 1745$-$248,\nlocated in the globular cluster Terzan 5. Combining (near-) simultaneous radio\nand X-ray measurements we measure a correlation between the radio and X-ray\nluminosities of $L_R\\propto L_X^\\beta$ with $\\beta=1.68^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$,\nlinking the accretion flow (probed by X-ray luminosity) and the compact jet\n(probed by radio luminosity). While such a relationship has been studied in\nmultiple black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs), this work marks only the third NSXB\nwith such a measurement. Constraints on this relationship in NSXBs are strongly\nneeded, as comparing this correlation between different classes of XB systems\nis key in understanding the properties that affect the jet production process\nin accreting objects. Our best fit disc-jet coupling index for EXO 1745$-$248\nis consistent with the measured correlation in NSXB 4U 1728$-$34 ($\\beta=1.5\\pm\n0.2$) but inconsistent with the correlation we fit using the most recent\nmeasurements from the literature of NSXB Aql X-1\n($\\beta=0.76^{+0.14}_{-0.15}$). While a similar disc-jet coupling index appears\nto hold across multiple BHXBs in the hard accretion state, this does not appear\nto be the case with the three NSXBs measured so far. Additionally, the\nnormalization of the EXO 1745$-$248 correlation is lower than the other two\nNSXBs, making it one of the most radio faint XBs ever detected in the hard\nstate. We also report the detection of a type-I X-ray burst during this\noutburst, where the decay timescale is consistent with hydrogen burning.\n", "  We study the $SU(2)$ Principal Chiral Model (PCM) in the presence of an\nintegrable $\\eta$-deformation. We put the theory on $\\mathbb{R}\\times S^1$ with\ntwisted boundary conditions and then reduce the circle to obtain an effective\nquantum mechanics associated with the Whittaker-Hill equation. Using resurgent\nanalysis we study the large order behaviour of perturbation theory and recover\nthe fracton events responsible for IR renormalons. The fractons are modified\nfrom the standard PCM due to the presence of this $\\eta$-deformation but they\nare still the constituents of uniton-like solutions in the deformed quantum\nfield theory. We also find novel $SL(2,\\mathbb{C})$ saddles, thus strengthening\nthe conjecture that the semi-classical expansion of the path integral gives\nrise to a resurgent transseries once written as a sum over Lefschetz thimbles\nliving in a complexification of the field space. We conclude by connecting our\nquantum mechanics to a massive deformation of the $\\mathcal{N}=2~$ $4$-d gauge\ntheory with gauge group $SU(2)$ and $N_f=2$.\n", "  In this paper, we obtain the light neutrino masses and mixings consistent\nwith the experiments, in the democratic texture approach. The essential ansatz\nis that $\\nu_{Ri}$ are assumed to transform as \"right-handed fields\" $\\bf 2_{R}\n+ 1_{R}$ under the $S_{3L} \\times S_{3R}$ symmetry. The symmetry breaking terms\nare assumed to be diagonal and hierarchical. This setup only allows the normal\nhierarchy of the neutrino mass, and excludes both of inverted hierarchical and\ndegenerated neutrinos.\n  Although the neutrino sector has nine free parameters, several predictions\nare obtained at the leading order. When we neglect the smallest parameters\n$\\zeta_{\\nu}$ and $\\zeta_{R}$, all components of the mixing matrix $U_{\\rm\nPMNS}$ are expressed by the masses of light neutrinos and charged leptons. From\nthe consistency between predicted and observed $U_{\\rm PMNS}$, we obtain the\nlightest neutrino masses $m_{1}$ = (1.1 $\\to$ 1.4) meV, and the effective mass\nfor the double beta decay $\\vev{m_{ee}} \\simeq$ 4.5 meV.\n", "  It was recently pointed out in \\cite{Kim:2015hya} that AdS$_6$ solutions in\nIIB theory enjoy an extended symmetry structure and the consistent truncation\nto $D=4$ internal space leads to a nonlinear sigma model with target\n$SL(3,\\mathbb{R})/SO(2,1)$. We continue to study the purely bosonic $D=4$\neffective action, and elucidate how the addition of scalar potential term still\nallows Killing spinor equations in the absence of gauge fields. In particular,\nthe potential turns out to be a single diagonal component of the coset\nrepresentative. Furthermore, we perform a general analysis of the integrability\nconditions of Killing spinor equations and establish that the effective action\ncan be in fact generalized to arbitrary sizes and signatures, e.g. with target\n$SL(n,\\mathbb{R})/SO(p,n-p)$ and the scalar potential expressible by a single\ndiagonal component of the coset representative. We also comment on a similar\nconstruction and its generalizations of effective $D=5$ purely bosonic\nnon-linear sigma model action related to AdS$_6$ in M-theory.\n", "  We experimentally study the dynamics of granular media in a discharging\nhopper. In such flows, there often appears to be a critical outlet size $D_c$\nsuch that the flow never clogs for $D > D_c$. We report on the time-averaged\nvelocity distributions, as well as temporal intermittency in the\nensemble-averaged velocity of grains in a viewing window, for both $D < D_c$\nand $D > D_c$, near and far from the outlet. We characterize the velocity\ndistributions by the standard deviation and the skewness of the distribution of\nvertical velocities. We propose a measure for intermittency based on the\ntwo-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov $D_{KS}$-statistic for the velocity distributions\nas a function of time. We find that there is no discontinuity or kink in these\nvarious measures as a function of hole size. This result supports the\nproposition that there is no well-defined $D_c$ and that clogging is always\npossible. Furthermore, the intermittency time scale of the flow is set by the\nspeed of the grains at the hopper exit. This latter finding is consistent with\na model of clogging as the independent sampling for stable configurations at\nthe exit with a rate set by the exiting grain speed [Thomas and Durian, Phys.\nRev. Lett. (2015)].\n", "  We perform a Bayesian analysis to study possible features in the primordial\ninflationary power spectrum of scalar perturbations. In particular, we analyse\nthe possibility of detecting the imprint of these primordial features in the\nanisotropy temperature power spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\nand also in the matter power spectrum P (k). We use the most recent CMB data\nprovided by the Planck Collaboration and P (k) measurements from the eleventh\ndata release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We focus our analysis on a class\nof potentials whose features are localised at different intervals of angular\nscales, corresponding to multipoles in the ranges 10 < l < 60 (Oscill-1) and\n150 < l < 300 (Oscill-2). Our results show that one of the step-potentials\n(Oscill-1) provides a better fit to the CMB data than does the featureless LCDM\nscenario, with a moderate Bayesian evidence in favor of the former. Adding the\nP (k) data to the analysis weakens the evidence of the Oscill-1 potential\nrelative to the standard model and strengthens the evidence of this latter\nscenario with respect to the Oscill-2 model.\n", "  The fundamental interaction between tropical cyclones was investigated\nthrough a series of water tank experiements by Fujiwhara [20, 21, 22]. However,\na complete understanding of tropical cyclones remains an open research\nchallenge although there have been numerous investigations through measurments\nwith aircrafts/satellites, as well as with numerical simulations. This article\npresents a computational model for simulating the interaction between cyclones.\nThe proposed numerical method is presented briefly, where the time integration\nis performed by projecting the discrete system onto a Krylov subspace. The\nmethod filters the large scale fluid dynamics using a multiresolution\napproximation, and the unresolved dynamics is modeled with a Smagorinsky type\nsubgrid scale parameterization scheme. Numerical experiments with Fujiwhara\ninteractions are considered to verify modeling accuracy. An excellent agreement\nbetween the present simulation and a reference simulation at Re = 5000 has been\ndemonstrated. At Re = 37440, the kinetic energy of cyclones is seen\nconsolidated into larger scales with concurrent enstrophy cascade, suggesting a\nsteady increase of energy containing scales, a phenomena that is typical in\ntwo-dimensional turbulence theory. The primary results of this article suggest\na novel avenue for addressing some of the computational challenges of mesoscale\natmospheric circulations.\n", "  In the context of Twin Higgs models, we study a simple mechanism that\nsimultaneously generates asymmetries in the dark and visible sector through the\nout-of-equilibrium decay of a TeV scale particle charged under a combination of\nbaryon and twin baryon number. We predict the dark matter to be a 5 GeV twin\nbaryon, which is easy to achieve because of the similarity between the two\nconfinement scales. Dark matter is metastable and can decay to three quarks,\nyielding indirect detection signatures. The mechanism requires the introduction\nof a new colored particle, typically within the reach of the LHC, of which we\nstudy the rich collider phenomenology, including prompt and displaced dijets,\nmulti-jets, monojets and monotops.\n", "  We report a combined experimental and theoretical study of the candidate\ntype-II Weyl semimetal MoTe2. Using laser-based angle-resolved photoemission we\nresolve multiple distinct Fermi arcs on the inequivalent top and bottom (001)\nsurfaces. All surface states observed experimentally are reproduced by an\nelectronic structure calculation for the experimental crystal structure that\npredicts a topological Weyl semimetal state with 8 type-II Weyl points. We\nfurther use systematic electronic structure calculations simulating different\nWeyl point arrangements to discuss the robustness of the identified Weyl\nsemimetal state and the topological character of Fermi arcs in MoTe2.\n", "  The form of a sheath near a small electrode, with bias changing from below to\nabove the plasma potential is studied using 2D particle-in-cell (PIC)\nsimulations. Five cases are studied: (A) an electrode biased more than the\nelectron temperature ($T_e/e$) below the plasma potential, (B) an electrode\nbiased less than $T_e/2e$ below the plasma potential, (C) an electrode biased\nnearly at the plasma potential, (D) an electrode biased more than $T_i/2e$ but\nless than $T_e/2e$ above the plasma potential, and (E) an electrode biased much\ngreater than $T_e/2e$ above the plasma potential. In case (A), the electron\nvelocity distribution function (EVDF) is observed to be Maxwellian with a\nBoltzmann-type exponential density decay through the ion sheath and presheath.\nIn cases (B) and (C), the EVDFs exhibit a loss-cone type truncation due to fast\nelectrons overcoming the small potential difference between the electrode and\nplasma. No sheath is present in this regime, and the plasma remains\nquasineutral up to the electrode. The EVDF truncation leads to a presheath-like\ndensity and flow velocity gradient. In case (D) an electron sheath is present,\nand essentially all ions are repelled. Here the truncation driven behavior\npersists, but is accompanied by a shift in the maximum value of the EVDF that\nis not present in the negative bias cases. In case (E), the flow shift becomes\ngreater and the loss-cone moves further into the tail of the EVDF. In this case\nthe flow moment has significant contributions from both the flow shift of the\nEVDF maximum, and the loss-cone truncation.\n", "  Vectorial nature of dissipative solitons (DSs) with high repetition rates is\nstudied for the first time in a normal-dispersion fiber laser. Despite the fact\nthat the formed DSs are strongly chirped and the repetition rate is greater\nthan 100 MHz, polarization locked and polarization rotating group velocity\nlocked vector DSs can be formed under 129.3 MHz fundamental mode-locking and\n258.6 MHz harmonic mode-locking of the fiber laser, respectively. The two\northogonally polarized components of these vector DSs possess distinctly\ndifferent central wavelengths and travel together at the same group velocity in\nthe laser cavity, resulting in a gradual spectral edge and small steps on the\noptical spectra, which can be considered as an auxiliary indicator of the group\nvelocity locked vector DSs.\n", "  We study periodically driven closed quantum systems where two parameters of\nthe system Hamiltonian are driven with frequencies $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2=r\n\\omega_1$. We show that such drives may be used to tune towards dynamics\ninduced freezing where the wavefunction of the state of the system after a\ndrive cycle at time $T= 2\\pi/\\omega_1$ has almost perfect overlap with the\ninitial state. We locate regions in the $(\\omega_1 ,r)$ plane where the\nfreezing is near exact for a class of integrable and a specific non-integrable\nmodel. The integrable models that we study encompass Ising and XY models in\n$d=1$, Kitaev model in $d=2$, and Dirac fermions in graphene and atop a\ntopological insulator surface whereas the non-integrable model studied involves\nthe experimentally realized one-dimensional (1D) tilted Bose-Hubbard model in\nan optical lattice. In addition, we compute the relevant correlation functions\nof such driven systems and describe their characteristics in the region of\n$(\\omega_1,r)$ plane where the freezing is near-exact. We supplement our\nnumerical analysis with semi-analytic results for integrable driven systems\nwithin adiabatic-impulse approximation and discuss experiments which may test\nour theory.\n", "  Three-dimensional condensed matter incarnations of Weyl fermions generically\nhave a tilted dispersion---in sharp contrast with their elusive high-energy\nrelatives where a tilt is forbidden by Lorentz invariance, and with the\nlow-energy excitations of two-dimensional graphene sheets where a tilt is\nforbidden by either crystalline or particle-hole symmetry. Very recently, a\nnumber of materials (MoTe$_2$, LaAlGe and WTe$_2$) have been identified as\nhosts of so-called type-II Weyl fermions whose dispersion is so strongly tilted\nthat a Fermi surface is formed, whereby the Weyl node becomes a singular point\nconnecting electron and hole pockets. We here predict that these systems have\nremarkable properties in presence of magnetic fields. Most saliently, we show\nthat the nature of the chiral anomaly depends crucially on the relative angle\nbetween the applied field and the tilt, and that an inversion-asymmetric\novertilting can give rise to a chiral charge reversal with violating the\nconservation of chiral charges known from type-I Weyl materials. The\nfield-selective anomaly gives a novel magneto-optical resonance, providing an\nexperimental way to detect concealed Weyl nodes.\n", "  Inspired by some recent experiments and numerical works related to\nnanoresonators, we perform classical molecular dynamics simulations to\ninvestigate the thermal expansion and the ability of the device to act as a\nstrain sensor assisted by thermally-induced vibrations. The proposed model\nconsists in a chain of atoms interacting anharmonically with both ends clamped\nto thermal reservoirs. We analyze the thermal expansion and resonant frequency\nshifts as a function of temperature and the applied strain. For the transversal\nmodes the shift is approximately linear with strain. We also present analytical\nresults from canonical calculations in the harmonic approximation showing that\nthermal expansion is uniform along the device. This prediction also works when\nthe system operates in a nonlinear oscillation regime at moderate and high\ntemperatures.\n", "  A model to calculate particle-induced reaction cross sections with\nstatistical Hauser-Feshbach theory including direct reactions is given. The\nenergy average of scattering matrix from the coupled-channels optical model is\ndiagonalized by the transformation proposed by Engelbrecht and\nWeidenm\\\"{u}ller. The ensemble average of $S$-matrix elements in the\ndiagonalized channel space is approximated by a model of Moldauer [Phys.Rev.C\n{\\bf 12}, 744 (1975)] using newly parametrized channel degree-of-freedom\n$\\nu_a$ to better describe the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) reference\ncalculations. Moldauer approximation is confirmed by a Monte Carlo study using\nrandomly generated $S$-matrix, as well as the GOE three-fold integration\nformula. The method proposed is applied to the $^{238}$U(n,n') cross section\ncalculation in the fast energy range, showing an enhancement in the inelastic\nscattering cross sections.\n", "  We present experimental results on the observation of a bulk second-order\nnonlinear susceptibility derived from both free-space and integrated\nmeasurements in silicon nitride. Phase-matching is achieved through dispersion\nengineering of the waveguide cross-section, independently revealing multiple\ncomponents of the nonlinear susceptibility, namely X(2)yyy and X(2)xxy.\nAdditionally, we show how the generated second-harmonic signal may be actively\ntuned through the application of bias voltages across silicon nitride. The\nnonlinear material properties measured here are anticipated to allow for the\npractical realization of new nanophotonic devices in CMOS-compatible silicon\nnitride waveguides, adding to their viability for telecommunication, data\ncommunication, and optical signal processing applications.\n", "  Theoretical and experimental studies have shown that the fluctuations of in\nvivo systems break the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. One can thus ask what\ninformation is contained in the correlation functions of protein concentrations\nand how they relate to the response of the reactive network to a perturbation.\nAnswers to these questions are of prime importance to extract meaningful\nparameters from the in vivo fluorescence correlation spectroscopy data. In this\npaper we study the fluctuations of the concentration of a reactive species\ninvolved in a cyclic network that is in a non-equilibrium steady state\nperturbed by a noisy force, taking into account both the breaking of detailed\nbalance and extrinsic noises. Using a generic model for the network and the\nextrinsic noise, we derive a Chemical Langevin Equation that describes the\ndynamics of the system, we determine the expressions of the correlation\nfunctions of the concentrations, estimate the deviation of the\nfluctuation-dissipation theorem and the range of parameters in which an\neffective temperature can be defined.\n", "  We present a theoretical scheme to calculate the elastic constants of\nmagnetic materials in the high-temperature paramagnetic state. Our approach is\nbased on a combination of disordered local moments picture and ab initio\nmolecular dynamics (DLM-MD). Moreover, we investigate a possibility to enhance\nthe efficiency of the simulations of elastic properties using recently\nintroduced method: symmetry imposed force constant temperature dependent\neffective potential (SIFC-TDEP). We have chosen cubic paramagnetic CrN as a\nmodel system. This is done due to its technological importance and its\ndemonstrated strong coupling between magnetic and lattice degrees of freedom.\nWe have studied the temperature dependent single-crystal and polycrystalline\nelastic constants of paramagentic CrN up to 1200 K. The obtained results at T=\n300 K agree well with the experimental values of polycrystalline elastic\nconstants as well as Poisson ratio at room temperature. We observe that the\nYoung's modulus is strongly dependent on temperature, decreasing by ~14% from\nT=300 K to 1200 K. In addition we have studied the elastic anisotropy of CrN as\na function of temperature and we observe that CrN becomes substantially more\nisotropic as the temperature increases. We demonstrate that the use of Birch\nlaw may lead to substantial errors for calculations of temperature induced\nchanges of elastic moduli. The proposed methodology can be used for accurate\npredictions of mechanical properties of magnetic materials at temperatures\nabove their magnetic order-disorder phase transition.\n", "  We report the development of quantum microscopic theory of quasi-resonant\ndipole-dipole interaction in the ensembles of impurity atoms imbedded into\ntransparent dielectric and located into Fabry-Perot cavity. On the basis of the\ngeneral approach we study the simultaneous influence of the cavity and resonant\ndipole-dipole interaction on the shape of the line of atomic transition as well\nas on light trapping in dense impurity ensembles. We analyze this influence\ndepending on the size of the ensemble, its density, as well as on r.m.s.\ndeviation of the transition frequency shifts caused by the symmetry disturbance\nof the internal fields of the dielectric medium. Obtained results are compared\nwith the case when the cavity is absent. We show that the cavity can\nessentially modify cooperative polyatomic effects.\n", "  We demonstrate monolithic aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) optical\nanoantennas. Using a selective oxidation technique, we fabricate such epitaxial\nsemiconductor nanoparticles on an aluminum oxide substrate. Second harmonic\ngeneration from an AlGaAs nanocylinder of height h=400 nm and varying radius\npumped with femtosecond pulses delivered at 1554-nm wavelength has been\nmeasured, revealing a peak conversion efficiency exceeding 10-5 for\nnanocylinders with an otpimized geometry.\n", "  The Coulomb branch of 3-dimensional N=4 gauge theories is the space of bare\nand dressed BPS monopole operators. We utilise the conformal dimension to\ndefine a fan which, upon intersection with the weight lattice of a GNO-dual\ngroup, gives rise to a collection of semi-groups. It turns out that the unique\nHilbert bases of these semi-groups are a sufficient, finite set of monopole\noperators which generate the entire chiral ring. Moreover, the knowledge of the\nproperties of the minimal generators is enough to compute the Hilbert series\nexplicitly. The techniques of this paper allow an efficient evaluation of the\nHilbert series for general rank gauge groups. As an application, we provide\nvarious examples for all rank two gauge groups to demonstrate the novel\ninterpretation.\n", "  The growth rate of the compressible Rayleigh-Taylor instability is studied in\nthe presence of a background temperature gradient, $\\Theta$, using a normal\nmode analysis. The effect of $\\Theta$ variation is examined for three interface\ntypes corresponding to combinations of the viscous properties of the fluids\n(inviscid-inviscid, viscous-viscous and viscous-inviscid) at different Atwood\nnumbers, $At$, and, when at least one of the fluids' viscosity is non-zero, as\na function of the Grashof number. For the general case, the resulting ordinary\ndifferential equations are solved numerically; however, dispersion relations\nfor the growth rate are presented for several limiting cases. An analytical\nsolution is found for the inviscid-inviscid interface and the corresponding\ndispersion equation for the growth rate is obtained in the limit of a large\n$\\Theta$. For the viscous-inviscid case, a dispersion relation is derived in\nthe incompressible limit and $\\Theta=0$. Compared to $\\Theta=0$ case, the role\nof $\\Theta<0$ (hotter light fluid) is destabilizing and becomes stabilizing\nwhen $\\Theta>0$ (colder light fluid). The most pronounced effect when\n$\\Theta\\neq 0$ is found at low $At$ and/or at large perturbation wavelengths\nrelative to the domain size for all interface types. On the other hand, at\nsmall perturbation wavelengths relative to the domain size, the growth rate for\n$\\Theta<0$ case exceeds the infinite domain incompressible constant density\nresult. The results are applied to two practical examples, using sets of\nparameters relevant to Inertial Confinement Fusion coasting stage and solar\ncorona plumes. The role of viscosity on the growth rate reduction is discussed\ntogether with highlighting the range of wavenumbers most affected by viscosity.\nThe viscous effects further increase in the presence of background temperature\ngradient, when the viscosity is temperature dependent.\n", "  Exfoliated black phosphorus has recently emerged as a new two-dimensional\ncrystal that, due to its peculiar and anisotropic crystalline and electronic\nband structures, may have potentially important applications in electronics,\noptoelectronics and photonics. Despite the fact that the edges of layered\ncrystals host a range of singular properties whose characterization and\nexploitation are of utmost importance for device development, the edges of\nblack phosphorus remain poorly characterized. In this work, the atomic\nstructure and the behavior of phonons near different black phosphorus edges are\nexperimentally and theoretically studied using Raman spectroscopy and density\nfunctional theory calculations. Polarized Raman results show the appearance of\nnew modes at the edges of the sample, and their spectra depend on the atomic\nstructure of the edges (zigzag or armchair). Theoretical simulations confirm\nthat the new modes are due to edge phonon states that are forbidden in the\nbulk, and originated from the lattice termination rearrangements.\n", "  We consider a BMS-type symmetry action on isolated horizons in asymptotically\nflat spacetimes. From the viewpoint of the non-relativistic field theory on a\nhorizon membrane, supertranslations shift the field theory spatial momentum.\nThe latter is related by a Ward identity to the particle number symmetry\ncurrent and is spontaneously broken. The corresponding Goldstone boson shifts\nthe horizon angular momentum and can be detected quantum mechanically.\nSimilarly, area preserving superrotations are spontaneously broken on the\nhorizon membrane and we identify the corresponding gapless modes. In\nasymptotically AdS spacetimes we study the BMS-type symmetry action on the\nhorizon in a holographic superfluid dual. We identify the horizon\nsupertranslation Goldstone boson as the holographic superfluid Goldstone mode.\n", "  We examine the implication of the recently observed 750 GeV diphoton excess\nfor the electric dipole moments of the neutron and electron. If the excess is\ndue to a spin zero resonance which couples to photons and gluons through the\nloops of massive vector-like fermions, the resulting neutron electric dipole\nmoment can be comparable to the present experimental bound if the CP-violating\nangle {\\alpha} in the underlying new physics is of O(10^{-1}). An electron EDM\ncomparable to the present bound can be achieved through a mixing between the\n750 GeV resonance and the Standard Model Higgs boson, if the mixing angle\nitself for an approximately pseudoscalar resonance, or the mixing angle times\nthe CP-violating angle {\\alpha} for an approximately scalar resonance, is of\nO(10^{-3}). For the case that the 750 GeV resonance corresponds to a composite\npseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson formed by a QCD-like hypercolor dynamics confining\nat \\Lambda_HC, the resulting neutron EDM can be estimated with \\alpha ~ (750\nGeV / \\Lambda_HC)^2\\theta_HC, where \\theta_HC is the hypercolor vacuum angle.\n", "  The exact values of the presently determined components 26of the angular Fock\ncoefficients at the two-particle coalescences were obtained and systematized.\nThe Green Function approach was successfully applied to simplify the most\ncomplicated calculations. The boundary conditions for the Fock coefficient\ncomponents in the hyperspherical angular coordinates, which follows from the\nKato cusp conditions for the two-electron wave function in the natural\ninterparticle coordinates, were derived. The validity of the obtained boundary\nconditions was verified on examples of all the presently determined components.\nThe additional boundary conditions are not arising from the Kato cusp\nconditions were obtained as well. The Wolfram Mathematica was used intensively.\n", "  The longitudinal and transverse electromagnetic response functions of\n$^{12}$C are computed in a \"first-principles\" Green's function Monte Carlo\ncalculation, based on realistic two- and three-nucleon interactions and\nassociated one- and two-body currents. We find excellent agreement between\ntheory and experiment and, in particular, no evidence for the quenching of\nmeasured versus calculated longitudinal response. This is further corroborated\nby a re-analysis of the Coulomb sum rule, in which the contributions from the\nlow-lying $J^\\pi\\,$=$\\, 2^+$, $0^+_2$ (Hoyle), and $4^+$ states in $^{12}$C are\naccounted for explicitly in evaluating the total inelastic strength.\n", "  This paper is aimed at a (mostly) pedagogical exposition of the derivation of\nthe motion equations of certain modifications of general relativity. Here we\nderive in all detail the motion equations in the Brans-Dicke theory with the\ncubic self-interaction. This is a modification of the Brans-dicke theory by the\naddition of a term in the Lagrangian which is non-linear in the derivatives of\nthe scalar field: it contains second-order derivatives. This is the basis of\nthe so-called Brans-Dicke Galileon. We pay special attention to the variational\nprinciple and to the algebraic details of the derivation. It is shown how\nhigher order derivatives of the fields appearing in the intermediate\ncomputations cancel out leading to second order motion equations. The reader\nwill find useful tips for the derivation of the field equations of\nmodifications of general relativity such as the scalar-tensor theories and\n$f(R)$ theories, by means of the (stationary action) variational principle. The\ncontent of this paper is specially recommended to those graduate and\npostgraduate students who are interested in the study of the mentioned\nmodifications of general relativity.\n", "  Electronic excitations in dilute solutions of poly para phenylene ethynylene\n(poly-PPE) are studied using a QM/MM approach combining many-body Green's\nfunctions theory within the $GW$ approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation\nwith polarizable force field models. Oligomers up to a length of 7.5\\,nm (10\nrepeat units) functionalized with nonyl side chains are solvated in toluene and\nwater, respectively. After equilibration using atomistic molecular dynamics\n(MD), the system is partitioned into a quantum region (backbone) embedded into\na classical (side chains and solvent) environment. Optical absorption\nproperties are calculated solving the coupled QM/MM system self-consistently\nand special attention is paid to the effects of solvents. The model allows to\ndifferentiate the influence of oligomer conformation induced by the solvation\nfrom electronic effects related to local electric fields and polarization. It\nis found that the electronic environment contributions are negligible compared\nto the conformational dynamics of the conjugated PPE. An analysis of the\nelectron-hole wave function reveals a sensitivity of energy and localization\ncharacteristics of the excited states to bends in the global conformation of\nthe oligomer rather than to the relative of phenyl rings along the backbone.\n", "  We consider interference effects in the production via gluon fusion in LHC\ncollisions at 13 TeV and decays into $\\gamma \\gamma$ and $t {\\bar t}$ final\nstates of one or two putative new resonant states $\\Phi$, assumed here to be\nscalar and/or pseudo scalar particles. Although our approach is general, we use\nfor our numerical analysis the example of the putative $750$ GeV state for\nwhich a slight excess was observed in the initial LHC $13$ TeV data. We revisit\nprevious calculations of the interferences between the heavy-fermion\nloop-induced $gg \\to \\Phi \\to \\gamma \\gamma$ signal and the continuum $gg\\to\n\\gamma\\gamma$ QCD background, which can alter the production rate as well as\nmodify the line-shape and apparent mass. We find a modest enhancement by $\\sim\n20$% under favorable circumstances, for a large $\\Phi$ width. The effect of\ninterference on the apparent scalar-pseudoscalar mass difference in a\ntwo-Higgs-doublet model is found to be also modest. An exploratory study\nindicates that similar effects are to be expected in the $gg \\to \\Phi \\to Z\n\\gamma$ channel. In this and other models with a large $\\Phi$ total width, the\ndominant $\\Phi$ decays are expected to be into $t \\bar t$ final states. We\ntherefore also study the effects of interference of the $gg\\to \\Phi \\to t\\bar\nt$ signal with the $gg\\to t \\bar t$ continuum QCD background and show that in\nthe presence of standard fermions only in the $gg\\to \\Phi$ loops, it is\ndestructive causing a dip in the $t \\bar t$ mass distribution. Including\nadditional vector-like quarks leads to a different picture as peaks followed by\ndips can then occur. We use the absence of such effects in ATLAS and CMS data\nto constrain models of the production and decays of the $\\Phi$ state(s).\n", "  We study the phase behaviour of a binary mixture of colloidal hard spheres\nand freely-jointed chains of beads using Monte Carlo simulations. Recently\nPanagiotopoulos and coworkers predicted [Nat. Commun. 5, 4472 (2014)] that the\nhexagonal close packed (HCP) structure of hard spheres can be stabilized in\nsuch a mixture due to the interplay between polymer and the void structure in\nthe crystal phase. Their predictions were based on estimates of the free-energy\npenalty for adding a single hard polymer chain in the HCP and the competing\nface centered cubic (FCC) phase. Here we calculate the phase diagram using\nfree-energy calculations of the full binary mixture and find a broad\nfluid-solid coexistence region and a metastable gas-liquid coexistence region.\nFor the colloid-monomer size ratio considered in this work, we find that the\nHCP phase is only stable in a small window at relatively high polymer reservoir\npacking fractions, where the coexisting HCP phase is nearly close packed.\nAdditionally we investigate the structure and dynamic behaviour of these\nmixtures.\n", "  Linear stability analysis has proven to be a useful tool in the analysis of\ndominant coherent structures, such as the von K\\'{a}rm\\'{a}n vortex street and\nthe global spiral mode associated with the vortex breakdown of swirling jets.\nIn recent years, linear stability analysis has been applied successfully to\nturbulent time-mean flows, instead of laminar base-flows,\n\\textcolor{black}{which requires turbulent models that account for the\ninteraction of the turbulent field with the coherent structures. To retain the\nstability equations of laminar flows, the Boussinesq approximation with a\nspatially nonuniform but isotropic eddy viscosity is typically employed. In\nthis work we assess the applicability of this concept to turbulent strongly\nswirling jets, a class of flows that is particularly unsuited for isotropic\neddy viscosity models. Indeed we find that unsteady RANS simulations only match\nwith experiments with a Reynolds stress model that accounts for an anisotropic\neddy viscosity. However, linear stability analysis of the mean flow is shown to\naccurately predict the global mode growth rate and frequency if the employed\nisotropic eddy viscosity represents a least-squares approximation of the\nanisotropic eddy viscosity. Viscosities derived from the $k-\\epsilon$ model did\nnot achieve a good prediction of the mean flow nor did they allow for accurate\nstability calculations. We conclude from this study that linear stability\nanalysis can be accurate for flows with strongly anisotropic turbulent\nviscosity and the capability of the Boussinesq approximation in terms of\nURANS-based mean flow prediction is not a prerequisite.\n", "  Collective cell migration in response to a chemical cue occurs in many\nbiological processes such as morphogenesis and cancer metastasis. Clusters of\nmigratory cells in these systems are capable of responding to gradients of less\nthan 1% difference in chemical concentration across a cell length.\nMulticellular systems are extremely sensitive to their environment and while\nthe limits to multicellular sensing are becoming known, how this information\nleads to coherent migration remains poorly understood. We develop a\ncomputational model of multicellular sensing and migration in which groups of\ncells collectively measure noisy chemical gradients. The output of the sensing\nprocess is coupled to individual cells polarization to model migratory\nbehavior. Through the use of numerical simulations, we find that larger\nclusters of cells detect the gradient direction with higher precision and thus\nachieve stronger polarization bias, but larger clusters also induce more drag\non collective motion. The trade-off between these two effects leads to an\noptimal cluster size for most efficient migration. We discuss how our model\ncould be validated using simple, phenomenological experiments.\n", "  We construct the Laurent phenomenon algebras the cluster variables of which\nsatisfy the discrete BKP equation and other difference equations obtained by\nits reduction. These Laurent phenomenon algebras are constructed from seeds\nwith a generalization of mutation-period property. We show that a reduction of\na seed corresponds to a reduction of a difference equation.\n", "  We demonstrate that the total energy of electromagnetic field in the Bardeen\nand Ay\\'on-Beato-Garc\\'ia singularity-free models is equal to the mass\nparameter $M$, being therefore independent of the charge parameter $Q$. Our\nresult is fully congruent with the original idea of Born and Infeld to use\nnonlinear electrodynamics for proving the electromagnetic nature of mass.\n", "  The understanding of the pion structure as described in terms of\ntransverse-momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) is of\nimportance for the interpretation of currently ongoing Drell-Yan experiments\nwith pion beams. In this work we discuss the description of pion TMDs beyond\nleading twist in a pion model formulated in the light-front constituent\nframework. For comparison, we also review and derive new results for pion TMDs\nin the bag and spectator models.\n", "  The experimental observation of the self$-$excited dust acoustic waves (DAWs)\nand its propagation characteristics in the absence and presence of a floating\ncylindrical object are investigated. The experiments are carried out in a\ndirect current (DC) glow discharge dusty plasma in the background of argon gas.\nDust particles are found levitated at the interface of plasma and cathode\nsheath region. The DAWs are spontaneously excited in the dust medium and found\nto propagate in the direction of ion drift (along the gravity) above a\nthreshold discharge current at lower pressure. The excitation of such low\nfrequency wave is a result of the ion--dust streaming instability in the dust\ncloud. The characteristics of the propagating dust acoustic wave get modified\nin presence of a floating cylindrical object of radius larger than the dust\nDebye length. Instead of propagating in the vertical direction, the DAWs are\nfound to propagate obliquely in presence of the floating object (kept either\nvertically or horizontally). In addition, horizontally aligned floating object\ngives rise to form a wave structure in the cone shaped dust cloud in the sheath\nregion. The change in the propagation characteristics of DAWs are explained on\nthe basis of modified potential (or electric field) distribution, which is a\nconsequence of coupling of sheaths formed around the cylindrical object and the\ncathode.\n", "  The frequency-dependent longitudinal and Hall conductivities ---\n$\\sigma_{xx}$ and $\\sigma_{xy}$ --- are dimensionless functions of $\\omega/T$\nin 2+1 dimensional CFTs at nonzero temperature. These functions characterize\nthe spectrum of charged excitations of the theory and are basic experimental\nobservables. We compute these conductivities for large $N$ Chern-Simons theory\nwith fermion matter. The computation is exact in the 't Hooft coupling\n$\\lambda$ at $N = \\infty$. We describe various physical features of the\nconductivity, including an explicit relation between the weight of the delta\nfunction at $\\omega = 0$ in $\\sigma_{xx}$ and the existence of infinitely many\nhigher spin conserved currents in the theory. We also compute the\nconductivities perturbatively in Chern-Simons theory with scalar matter and\nshow that the resulting functions of $\\omega/T$ agree with the strong coupling\nfermionic result. This provides a new test of the conjectured 3d bosonization\nduality. In matching the Hall conductivities we resolve an outstanding puzzle\nby carefully treating an extra anomaly that arises in the regularization scheme\nused.\n", "  We analyze the present bounds of a scotogenic model, the Radiative Type III\nSeesaw (RSIII), in which an additional scalar doublet and at least two fermion\ntriplets of $SU(2)_L$ are added to the Standard Model (SM). In the RSIII the\nnew physics (NP) sector is odd under an exact global $Z_2$ symmetry. This\nsymmetry guaranties that the lightest NP neutral particle is stable, providing\na natural dark matter (DM) candidate, and leads to naturally suppressed\nneutrino masses generated by a one-loop realization of an effective Weinberg\noperator. We focus on the region with the highest sensitivity in present and\nfuture LHC searches, with light scalar DM and at least one NP fermion triplet\nat the sub-TeV scale. This region allows for significant production\ncross-sections of NP fermion pairs at the LHC. We reinterpret a set of searches\nfor supersymmetric particles at the LHC obtained using the package CheckMATE,\nto set limits on our model as a function of the masses of the NP particles and\ntheir Yukawa interactions. The most sensitive search channel is found to be\ndileptons plus missing transverse energy. In order to target the case of tau\nenhanced decays and the case of compressed spectra we reinterpret the recent\nslepton and chargino search bounds by ATLAS. For a lightest NP fermion triplet\nwith a maximal branching ratio to either electrons or muons we exclude NP\nfermion masses of up to 650 GeV, while this bound is reduced to approximately\n400 GeV in the tau-philic case. Allowing for a general flavor structure we set\nlimits on the Yukawa couplings, which are directly related to the neutrino\nflavor structure.\n", "  We present Herschel, ALMA Compact Array (ACA), and Caltech Submillimeter\nObservatory (CSO) observations of the prestellar core in L1689N, which has been\nsuggested to be interacting with a molecular outflow driven by the nearby solar\ntype protostar IRAS 16293-2422. This source is characterized by some of the\nhighest deuteration levels seen in the interstellar medium. The change in the\nNH2D line velocity and width across the core provides clear evidence of an\ninteraction with the outflow, traced by the high-velocity water emission.\nQuiescent, cold gas, characterized by narrow line widths is seen in the NE part\nof the core, while broader, more disturbed line profiles are seen in the W/SW\npart. Strong N2D+ and ND3 emission is detected with the ACA, extending S/SW\nfrom the peak of the single-dish NH2D emission. The ACA data also reveal the\npresence a compact dust continuum source, with a mean size of ~1100 au, a\ncentral density of (1-2) 10^7 cm-3, and a mass of 0.2-0.4 Msun. The dust\nemission peak is displaced ~5\" to the south with respect to the N2D+ and ND3\nemission, as well as the single-dish dust continuum peak, suggesting that the\nnorthern, quiescent part of the core is characterized by spatially extended\ncontinuum emission, which is resolved out by the interferometer. We see no\nclear evidence of fragmentation in this quiescent part of the core, which could\nlead to a second generation of star formation, although a weak dust continuum\nsource is detected in this region in the ACA data.\n", "  Self-organized pattern formation by the process of reverse epitaxial growth\nhas been investigated on GaAs (001) surfaces during 1 keV Ar+ bombardment at\ntarget temperature of 450 degC for a wide range of incident angles. Highly\nordered ripple formation driven by diffusion instability is evidenced at near\nnormal incidence angles. Concurrent sample rotation shows that the ripple\nmorphology and its orientation do not depend on the incident beam direction;\nrather they are determined by the symmetry of the crystal face.\n", "  In this work we use belief-propagation techniques to study the equilibrium\nbehaviour of a minimal model for the immune system comprising interacting T and\nB clones. We investigate the effect of the so-called idiotypic interactions\namong complementary B clones on the system's activation. Our result shows that\nB-B interactions increase the system's resilience to noise, making clonal\nactivation more stable, while increasing the cross-talk between different\nclones. We derive analytically the noise level at which a B clone gets\nactivated, in the absence of cross-talk, and find that this increases with the\nstrength of idiotypic interactions and with the number of T cells signalling\nthe B clone. We also derive, analytically and numerically, via population\ndynamics, the critical line where clonal cross-talk arises. Our approach allows\nus to derive the B clone size distribution, which can be experimentally\nmeasured and gives important information about the adaptive immune system\nresponse to antigens and vaccination.\n", "  The rapidly improving precision of measurements of gravitational lensing of\nthe Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) also requires a corresponding increase in\nthe precision of theoretical modeling. A commonly made approximation is to\nmodel the CMB deflection angle or lensing potential as a Gaussian random field.\nIn this paper, however, we analytically quantify the influence of the\nnon-Gaussianity of large-scale structure lenses, arising from nonlinear\nstructure formation, on CMB lensing measurements. In particular, evaluating the\nimpact of the non-zero bispectrum of large-scale structure on the relevant CMB\nfour-point correlation functions, we find that there is a bias to estimates of\nthe CMB lensing power spectrum. For temperature-based lensing reconstruction\nwith CMB Stage-III and Stage-IV experiments, we find that this lensing power\nspectrum bias is negative and is of order one percent of the signal. This\ncorresponds to a shift of multiple standard deviations for these upcoming\nexperiments. We caution, however, that our numerical calculation only evaluates\ntwo of the largest bias terms and thus only provides an approximate estimate of\nthe full bias. We conclude that further investigation into lensing biases from\nnonlinear structure formation is required and that these biases should be\naccounted for in future lensing analyses.\n", "  The phenomenological formula for ground state binding energy derived earlier\n(International Journal of Modern Physics E {\\bf 20} (2011) 179) has been\nmodified. The parameters have been obtained by fitting the latest available\ntabulation of experimental values. The major modifications include a new term\nfor pairing and introduction of a new neutron magic number at $N=160$. The new\nformula reduced the root mean square deviation to 363 keV, a substantial\nimprovement over the previous version of the formula.\n", "  Superconducting FeSe single crystals of (001) orientation are synthesized via\na hydrothermal ion-release route. An Ising spin-nematic order is identified by\nour systematic measurements of in-plane angular-dependent magnetoresistance\n(AMR) and static magnetization. The turn-on temperature of anisotropic AMR\nsignifies the Ising spin-nematic ordering temperature Tsn, below which a\ntwo-fold rotational symmetry is observed in the iron plane. A downward\ncurvature appears below Tsn in the temperature dependence of static\nmagnetization for the weak in-plane magnetic field as reported previously.\nRemarkably, we find a universal linear relationship between Tc and Tsn among\nvarious superconducting samples, indicating that the spin nematicity and the\nsuperconductivity in FeSe have a common microscopic origin.\n", "  We combine wide and deep galaxy number-count data from GAMA, COSMOS/G10, HST\nERS, HST UVUDF and various near-, mid- and far- IR datasets from ESO, Spitzer\nand Herschel. The combined data range from the far-UV (0.15microns) to far-IR\n(500microns), and in all cases the contribution to the integrated galaxy light\n(IGL) of successively fainter galaxies converges. Using a simple spline fit, we\nderive the IGL and the extrapolated-IGL in all bands. We argue undetected low\nsurface brightness galaxies and intra-cluster/group light is modest, and that\nour extrapolated-IGL measurements are an accurate representation of the\nextra-galactic background light. Our data agree with most earlier IGL estimates\nand with direct measurements in the far-IR, but disagree strongly with direct\nestimates in the optical. Close agreement between our results and recent very\nhigh-energy experiments (H.E.S.S. and MAGIC), suggest that there may be an\nadditional foreground affecting the direct estimates. The most likely culprit\ncould be the adopted Zodiacal light model. Finally we use a modified version of\nthe two-component model to integrate the EBL and obtain measurements of the\nCosmic Optical Background (COB) and Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) of:\n$24^{+4}_{-4}$nWm$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$ and $26^{+5}_{-5}$nWm$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$\nrespectively (48:52%). Over the next decade, upcoming space missions such as\nEuclid and WFIRST, have the capacity to reduce the COB error to $<1\\%$, at\nwhich point comparisons to the very high energy data could have the potential\nto provide a direct detection and measurement of the reionisation field.\n", "  We study the complex deformations of orientifolds of D3-branes at toric CY\nsingularities, using their description in terms of dimer diagrams. We describe\norientifold quotients that have fixed lines or fixed points in the dimer, and\ncharacterize the possibilities to deform them in terms of the behaviour of\nzig-zag paths under the orientifold symmetry. The resulting models are\nholographic duals to warped throats with orientifold planes. Our systematic\nconstruction provides a general class of configurations which includes models\nrecently appeared in the context of de Sitter uplift by nilpotent goldstino or\ndynamical supersymmetry breaking.\n", "  Exciton, trion and electron spin dynamics in a 20 nm wide modulation-doped\nGaAs single quantum well are investigated using resonant ultrafast two-color\nKerr rotation spectroscopy. Excitons and trions are selectively detected by\nresonant probe pulses while their relative spectral weight is controlled by\nadjusting the gate voltage which tunes the carrier density. Tuning the carrier\ndensity markedly influences the spin decay time of the two dimensional electron\ngas. The spin decay time can be enhanced by a factor of 3 at an intermediate\ncarrier concentration in the quantum well, where excitons and trions coexist in\nthe system. In addition, we explore the capability to tune the g-factor of the\nelectron gas via the carrier density.\n", "  In the present study we are interested in the Davey-Stewartson equations\n(DSE) that model packets of surface and capillary-gravity waves. We focus on\nthe elliptic-elliptic case, for which it is known that DSE may develop a\nfinite-time singularity. We propose three systems of non-viscous regularization\nto the DSE in variety of parameter regimes under which the finite blow-up of\nsolutions to the DSE occurs. We establish the global well-posedness of the\nregularized systems for all initial data. The regularized systems, which are\ninspired by the $\\alpha$-models of turbulence and therefore are called the\n$\\alpha$-regularized DSE, are also viewed as unbounded, singularly perturbed\nDSE. Therefore, we also derive reduced systems of ordinary differential\nequations for the $\\alpha$-regularized DSE by using the modulation theory to\ninvestigate the mechanism with which the proposed non-viscous regularization\nprevents the formation of the singularities in the regularized DSE. This is a\nfollow-up of the work of Cao, Musslimani and Titi on the non-viscous\n$\\alpha$-regularization of the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation.\n", "  We propose a scheme of acoustic spherical cloaking by means of background\nirrotational flow in compressible fluid. The background flow forms a virtual\ncurved spacetime and guides the sound waves bypass the cloaked objects. To\nsatisfy the laws of real fluid, we show that spatially distributed mass source\nand momentum source are necessary to supply. The propagation of sound waves in\nthis system is studied via both geometric acoustics approximation and full wave\napproach. The analytic solution of sound fields is obtained for plane wave\nincidence. The results reveal the effect of phase retardation (or lead) in\ncomparison with the ordinary transformation-acoustic cloak. In addition, the\nability of cloaking is also evaluated for unideal background flows by analyzing\nthe scattering cross section.\n", "  We investigate lepton flavor violation (LFV) in the the singlet-triplet\nscotogenic model in which neutrinos acquire non-zero masses at the 1-loop\nlevel. In contrast to the most popular variant of this setup, the singlet\nscotogenic model, this version includes a triplet fermion as well as a triplet\nscalar, leading to a scenario with a richer dark matter phenomenology. Taking\ninto account results from neutrino oscillation experiments, we explore some\naspects of the LFV phenomenology of the model. In particular, we study the\nrelative weight of the dipole operators with respect to other contributions to\nthe LFV amplitudes and determine the most constraining observables. We show\nthat in large portions of the parameter space, the most promising experimental\nperspectives are found for LFV 3-body decays and for coherent $\\mu-e$\nconversion in nuclei.\n", "  We studied the effect of water vapor on the performance of glass Resistive\nPlate Chambers (RPCs) in the avalanche mode operation. Controlled and\ncalibrated amount of water vapor was added to the RPC gas mixture that has\nC$_2$H$_2$F$_4$ as the major component. The deterioration in the performance of\nRPC was observed while operating with wet gas and recovered after switching to\nstandard gas.\n", "  In the CBM (Compressed Baryonic Matter) experiment constructed at the\nFacility for Anti-proton and Ion Research (Fair) at GSI, Darmstadt, Germany,\nMRPC(Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chamber) is adopted to construct the large TOF\n(Time-of-Flight) system to achieve an unprecedented precision of hadron\nidentification, benefiting from its good time resolution, relatively high\nefficiency and low building price. We have developed a kind of double-ended\nreadout strip MRPC. It uses low resistive glass to keep good performance of\ntime resolution under high-rate condition. The differential double stack\nstructure of 2x4 gas gaps help to reduce the required high voltage to half.\nThere are 24 strips on one counter, and each is 270mm long, 7mm wide and the\ninterval is 3mm. Ground is placed onto the MRPC electrode and feed through is\ncarefully designed to match the 100 Ohm impedance of PADI electronics. The\nprototype of this strip MRPC has been tested with cosmic ray, a 98% efficiency\nand 60ps time resolution is gotten. In order to further examine the performance\nof the detector working under higher particle flux rate, the prototype has been\ntested in the 2014 October GSI beam time and 2015 February CERN beam time. In\nboth beam times a relatively high rate of 1 kHz/cm2 was obtained. The\ncalibration is done with CBM ROOT. A couple of corrections has been considered\nin the calibration and analysis process (including time-walk correction, gain\ncorrection, strip alignment correction and velocity correction) to access\nactual counter performances such as efficiency and time resolution. An\nefficiency of 97% and time resolution of 48ps are obtained. All these results\nshow that the real-size prototype is fully capable of the requirement of the\nCBM-TOF, and new designs such as self-sealing are modified into the strip\ncounter prototype to obtain even better performance.\n", "  The time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation and the Boltzmann transport\nequation for one-dimensional charge-density-wave (CDW) conductors are derived\nfrom a microscopic model by applying the Keldysh Green's function approach\nunder a quasiclassical approximation. The effects of external electric field\nand impurity pinning of the CDW are fully taken into account without relying on\na phenomenological argument. These equations simultaneously describe\nspatiotemporal dynamics of both the CDW and quasiparticles, so they serve as a\npowerful tool to analyze various nonequilibrium phenomena, such as the current\nconversion between the CDW condensate and quasiparticles mediated by phase\nslips. It is shown that, in typical situations, the equations correctly\ndescribe the nonlinear behavior of electric conductivity in a simpler manner.\n", "  In this note we explored the holographic relative entropy in the presence of\nthe 5d Chern-Simons term, which introduces a mixed gauge-gravity anomaly to the\ndual CFT. The theory trivially satisfies an entanglement first law. However, to\nquadratic order in perturbations of the stress tensor $T$ and current density\n$J$, there is a mixed contribution to the relative entropy bi-linear in $T$ and\n$J$, signalling a potential violation of the positivity of the relative\nentropy. Miraculously, the term vanishes up to linear order in a derivative\nexpansion. This prompted a closer inspection on a different consistency check,\nthat involves time-delay of a graviton propagating in a charged background,\nscattered via a coupling supplied by the Chern-Simons term. The analysis\nsuggests that the time-delay can take either sign, potentially violating\ncausality for any finite value of the CS coupling.\n", "  It is shown how cosmological perturbation theory arises from a fully\nquantized perturbative theory of quantum gravity. Central for the derivation is\na non-perturbative concept of gauge-invariant local observables by means of\nwhich perturbative invariant expressions of arbitrary order are generated. In\nparticular, in the linearised theory, first order gauge-invariant observables\nfamiliar from cosmological perturbation theory are recovered. Explicit\nexpressions of second order quantities are presented as well.\n", "  We study a class of ${\\cal N}=(1,0)$ little string theories obtained from\norbifolds of M-brane configurations. These are realised in two different ways\nthat are dual to each other: either as $M$ parallel M5-branes probing a\ntransverse $A_{N-1}$ singularity or $N$ M5-branes probing an $A_{M-1}$\nsingularity. These backgrounds can further be dualised into toric, non-compact\nCalabi-Yau threefolds $X_{N,M}$ which have double elliptic fibrations and thus\ngive a natural geometric description of T-duality of the little string\ntheories. The little string partition functions are captured by the topological\nstring partition function of $X_{N,M}$. We analyse in detail the free energies\n$\\Sigma_{N,M}$ associated with the latter in a special region in the K\\\"ahler\nmoduli space of $X_{N,M}$ and discover a remarkable property: in the\nNekrasov-Shatashvili-limit, $\\Sigma_{N,M}$ is identical to $NM$ times\n$\\Sigma_{1,1}$. This entails that the BPS degeneracies for any $(N,M)$ can\nuniquely be reconstructed from the $(N,M)=(1,1)$ configuration, a property we\nrefer to as self-similarity. Moreover, as $\\Sigma_{1,1}$ is known to display a\nnumber of recursive structures, BPS degeneracies of little string\nconfigurations for arbitrary $(N,M)$ as well acquire additional symmetries.\nThese symmetries suggest that in this special region the two little string\ntheories described above are self-dual under T-duality.\n", "  We investigate experimentally the quenching of a liquid pancake, obtained\nthrough the impact of a water drop on a cold solid substrate ($0$ to\n$-60^\\circ$C). We show that, below a certain substrate temperature, fractures\nappear on the frozen pancake and the crack patterns change from a 2D\nfragmentation regime to a hierarchical fracture regime as the thermal shock is\nstronger. The different regimes are discussed and the transition temperatures\nare estimated through classical fracture scaling arguments. Finally, a phase\ndiagram presents how these regimes can be controlled by the drop impact\nparameters.\n", "  We consider any noncontextuality inequality, and the state preparation scheme\nwhich consists in performing any von Neumann measurement on any initial state.\nFor an inequality which is not always satisfied, and Hilbert space dimensions\ngreater than a value specified by the inequality, we determine necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the existence of observables with which the\ninequality is violated after the preparation process. For an initial state with\nno zero eigenvalues, there are always such observables, and which are\nindependent of this state.\n", "  Nematic elastomers and glasses are solids that display spontaneous distortion\nunder external stimuli. Recent advances in the synthesis of sheets with\ncontrolled heterogeneities have enabled their actuation into non-trivial shapes\nwith unprecedented energy density. Thus, these have emerged as powerful\ncandidates for soft actuators. To further this potential, we introduce the key\nmetric constraint which governs shape changing actuation in these sheets. We\nthen highlight the richness of shapes amenable to this constraint through two\nbroad classes of examples which we term nonisometric origami and lifted\nsurfaces. Finally, we comment on the derivation of the metric constraint, which\narises from energy minimization in the interplay of stretching, bending and\nheterogeneity in these sheets.\n", "  Community detection, the division of a network into dense subnetworks with\nonly sparse connections between them, has been a topic of vigorous study in\nrecent years. However, while there exist a range of powerful and flexible\nmethods for dividing a network into a specified number of communities, it is an\nopen question how to determine exactly how many communities one should use.\nHere we describe a mathematically principled approach for finding the number of\ncommunities in a network using a maximum-likelihood method. We demonstrate the\napproach on a range of real-world examples with known community structure,\nfinding that it is able to determine the number of communities correctly in\nevery case.\n", "  We study the zero temperature conductance and magnetoconductance of ballistic\n\\textit{p-n} junctions in Weyl semimetals. Electron transport is mediated by\nKlein tunneling between \\textit{n}- and \\textit{p}- regions. The chiral anomaly\nthat is realized in Weyl semimetals plays a crucial role in the\nmagnetoconductance of the junction. With the exception of field orientations\nwhere the angle between $\\mathbf{B}$ and the junction plane is small,\nmagnetoconductance is positive and linear in $B$ at both weak and strong\nmagnetic fields. In contrast, magnetoconductance in conventional \\textit{p-n}\njunctions is always negative.\n", "  As noted by Witten, compactifying a $d$-dimensional holographic CFT on an\n$S^1$ gives a class of $(d-1)$-dimensional confining theories with gravity\nduals. The prototypical bulk solution dual to the ground state is a double Wick\nrotation of the AdS$_{d+1}$ Schwarzschild black hole known as the AdS soliton.\nWe generalize such examples by allowing slow variations in the size of the\n$S^1$, and thus in the confinement scale. Coefficients governing the second\norder response of the system are computed for $3 \\le d \\le 8$ using a\nderivative expansion closely related to the fluid-gravity correspondence. The\nprimary physical results are that i) gauge-theory flux tubes tend to align\northogonal to gradients and along the eigenvector of the Hessian with the\nlowest eigenvalue, ii) flux tubes aligned orthogonal to gradients are attracted\nto gradients for $d \\le 6$ but repelled by gradients for $d \\ge 7$, iii) flux\ntubes are repelled by regions where the second derivative along the tube is\nlarge and positive but are attracted to regions where the eigenvalues of the\nHessian are large and positive in directions orthogonal to the tube, and iv)\nfor $d > 3$, inhomogeneities act to raise the total energy of the confining\nvacuum above its zeroth order value.\n", "  Electric field noise is a major source of motional heating in trapped ion\nquantum computation. While the influence of trap electrode geometries on\nelectric field noise has been studied in patch potential and surface adsorbate\nmodels, only smooth surfaces are accounted for by current theory. The effects\nof roughness, a ubiquitous feature of surface electrodes, are poorly\nunderstood. We investigate its impact on electric field noise by deriving a\nrough-surface Green's function and evaluating its effects on adsorbate-surface\nbinding energies. At cryogenic temperatures, heating rate contributions from\nadsorbates are predicted to exhibit an exponential sensitivity to local surface\ncurvature, leading to either a large net enhancement or suppression over smooth\nsurfaces. For typical experimental parameters, orders-of-magnitude variations\nin total heating rates can occur depending on the spatial distribution of\nabsorbates. Through careful engineering of electrode surface profiles, our\nresults suggests that heating rates can be tuned over orders of magnitudes.\n", "  The effect of compressibility in charged particle energization by\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) fields is studiedin the context of test particle\nsimulations. This problem is relevant to the solar wind and the solar corona\ndue to the compressible nature of the flow in those astrophysical scenarios. We\nconsider turbulent electromagnetic fields obtained from direct numerical\nsimulations of the MHD equations with a strong background magnetic field. In\norder to explore the flow compressibilty effect over the particle dynamics we\nperformed different numerical experiments: an incompressible case, and two weak\ncompressible cases with Mach number M = 0.1 and M = 0.25. We analyze the\nbehavior of protons and electrons in those turbulent fields, which are well\nknown to form aligned current sheets in the direction of the guide magnetic\nfield. What we call protons and electrons are test particles with scales\ncomparable to (for protons) and much smaller than (for electrons) the\ndissipative scale of MHD turbulence, maintaining the correct mass ratio me /mi.\nFor these test particles we show that compressibility enhances the efficiency\nof proton acceleration, and that the energization is caused by perpendicular\nelectric fields generated between currents sheets. On the other hand, electrons\nremain magnetized and display an almost adiabatic motion, with no effect of\ncompressibility observed. Another set of numerical experiments takes into\naccount two fluid modifications, namely electric field due to Hall effect and\nelectron pressure gradient. We show that the electron pressure has an important\ncontribution to electron acceleration allowing highly parallel energization. In\ncontrast, no significant effect of these additional terms is observed for the\nprotons.\n", "  We present an improved search for neutrinoless double-beta ($0\\nu\\beta\\beta$)\ndecay of $^{136}$Xe in the KamLAND-Zen experiment. Owing to purification of the\nxenon-loaded liquid scintillator, we achieved a significant reduction of the\n$^{110m}$Ag contaminant identified in previous searches. Combining the results\nfrom the first and second phase, we obtain a lower limit for the\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay half-life of $T_{1/2}^{0\\nu} > 1.07 \\times 10^{26}$ yr\nat 90% C.L., an almost sixfold improvement over previous limits. Using commonly\nadopted nuclear matrix element calculations, the corresponding upper limits on\nthe effective Majorana neutrino mass are in the range 61-165 meV. For the most\noptimistic nuclear matrix elements, this limit reaches the bottom of the\nquasi-degenerate neutrino mass region.\n", "  We propose a novel approach to site-resolved detection of a 2D gas of\nultracold atoms in an optical lattice. A near resonant laser beam is coherently\nscattered by the atomic array and its interference pattern is holographically\nrecorded by superimposing it with a reference laser beam on a CCD chip. Fourier\ntransformation of the recorded intensity pattern reconstructs the atomic\ndistribution in the lattice with single-site resolution. The holographic\ndetection method requires only a few hundred scattered photons per atom in\norder to achieve a high reconstruction fidelity. Therefore, additional cooling\nduring detection might not be necessary even for light atomic elements such as\nlithium.\n", "  Bell's inequality for continuous-variable bipartite systems is studied. The\ninequality is expressed in terms of pseudo-spin operators and quantum\nexpectation values are calculated for generic two-mode squeezed states\ncharacterized by a squeezing parameter $r$ and a squeezing angle $\\varphi$.\nAllowing for generic values of the squeezing angle is especially relevant when\n$\\varphi$ is not under experimental control, such as in cosmic inflation, where\nsmall quantum fluctuations in the early Universe are responsible for structures\nformation. Compared to previous studies restricted to $\\varphi=0$ and to a\nfixed orientation of the pseudo-spin operators, allowing for $\\varphi\\neq 0$\nand optimizing the angular configuration leads to a completely new and rich\nphenomenology. Two dual schemes of approximation are designed that allow for\ncomprehensive exploration of the squeezing parameters space. In particular, it\nis found that Bell's inequality can be violated when the squeezing parameter\n$r$ is large enough, $r\\gtrsim 1.12$, and the squeezing angle $\\varphi$ is\nsmall enough, $\\varphi\\lesssim 0.34\\,e^{-r}$.\n", "  The concept of edge state is investigated in the asymptotic suction boundary\nlayer in relation with the receptivity process to noisy perturbations and the\nnucleation of turbulent spots. Edge tracking is first performed numerically,\nwithout imposing any discrete symmetry, in a large computational domain\nallowing for full spatial localisation of the perturbation velocity. The edge\nstate is a three-dimensional localised structure recurrently characterised by a\nsingle low-speed streak that experiences erratic bursts and planar shifts. This\nrecurrent streaky structure is then compared with predecessors of individual\nspot nucleation events, triggered by non-localised initial noise. The present\nresults suggest a nonlinear picture, rooted in dynamical systems theory, of the\nnucleation process of turbulent spots in boundary-layer flows, in which the\nlocalised edge state play the role of state-space mediator.\n", "  Recent advances in the 3-D reconstruction of planetary nebulae are reviewed.\nWe include not only results for 3-D reconstructions, but also the current\ntechniques in terms of general methods and software. In order to obtain more\naccurate reconstructions, we suggest to extend the widely used assumption of\nhomologous nebula expansion to map spectroscopically measured velocity to\nposition along the line of sight.\n", "  We report on a comprehensive all-sky search for periodic gravitational waves\nin the frequency band 100-1500 Hz and with a frequency time derivative in the\nrange of $[-1.18, +1.00]\\times 10^{-8}$ Hz/s. Such a signal could be produced\nby a nearby spinning and slightly non-axisymmetric isolated neutron star in our\ngalaxy. This search uses the data from the Initial LIGO sixth science run and\ncovers a larger parameter space with respect to any past search.\n  A Loosely Coherent detection pipeline was applied to follow up weak outliers\nin both Gaussian (95% recovery rate) and non-Gaussian (75% recovery rate)\nbands. No gravitational wave signals were observed, and upper limits were\nplaced on their strength. Our smallest upper limit on worst-case (linearly\npolarized) strain amplitude $h_0$ is ${9.7}\\times 10^{-25}$ near 169 Hz, while\nat the high end of our frequency range we achieve a worst-case upper limit of\n${5.5}\\times 10^{-24}$. Both cases refer to all sky locations and entire range\nof frequency derivative values.\n", "  We explore the potential of 3D metal printing to realize complex conductive\nterahertz devices. Factors impacting performance such as printing resolution,\nsurface roughness, oxidation, and material loss are investigated via\nanalytical, numerical, and experimental approaches. The high degree of control\noffered by a 3D-printed topology is exploited to realize a zone plate operating\nat 530 GHz. Reflection efficiency at this frequency is found to be over 90%.\nThe high-performance of this preliminary device suggest that 3D metal printing\ncan play a strong role in guided-wave and general beam control devices in the\nterahertz range.\n", "  We point out that the $s$-channel unitarity of QCD imposes meaningful\nconstraints on a possible form of the QCD Reggeon Field Theory. We show that\nneither the BFKL nor JIMWLK nor Braun's Hamiltonian satisfy the said\nconstraints. In a toy, zero transverse dimensional case we construct a model\nthat satisfies the analogous constraint and show that at infinite energy it\nindeed tends to a \"black disk limit\" as opposed to the model with triple\nPomeron vertex only, routinely used as a toy model in the literature.\n", "  Using the method of modular-invariant differential equations, we classify a\nfamily of Rational Conformal Field Theories with two and three characters\nhaving no Kac-Moody algebra. In addition to unitary and non-unitary minimal\nmodels, we find \"dual\" theories whose characters obey bilinear relations with\nthose of the minimal models to give the Moonshine Module. In some ways this\nrelation is analogous to cosets of meromorphic CFT's. The theory dual in this\nsense to the Ising model has central charge 47/2 and is related to the Baby\nMonster Module.\n", "  High quality InN nanoparticles are grown using atmospheric chemical vapour\ndeposition technique via a self-seeded catalytic approach in the temperature\nrange of 580 to 650 oC. In this temperature region, nucleation barrier of InN\nis overcome by seeding the low density In nano-particles prior to the\nintroduction of reactive ammonia. Samples having increasing carrier density are\ngrown with the help of increasing growth temperature to understand its role in\noptical phonon structure. Near resonance Raman spectra show complete different\nphonon pictures as compared to those for the off-resonance spectra. A Raman\nforbidden mode of B1(high), because of the possible breakdown of selection rule\nin the near-resonance condition, is invoked for the first time. Intensity and\nfrequency of this mode strongly depend on the carrier concentration in the\nsample. In off-resonance conditions, A1(LO) mode for the sample with high\ncarrier concentration is dominated by Fano interference rather than\nplasmon-phonon coupling. Variation of intensity of the B1(high) mode is\ncorrelated with band filling effect, which is substantiated by the luminescence\nstudies of the InN samples with different carrier concentration.\n", "  Emission and absorption line observations of molecules in late-type stars are\na vital component in our understanding of stellar evolution, dust formation and\nmass loss in these objects. The molecular composition of the gas in the\ncircumstellar envelopes of AGB stars reflects chemical processes in gas whose\nproperties are strong functions of radius with density and temperature varying\nby more than ten and two orders of magnitude, respectively. In addition, the\ninterstellar UV field plays a critical role in determining not only molecular\nabundances but also their radial distributions. In this article, I shall\nbriefly review some recent successful approaches to describing chemistry in\nboth the inner and outer envelopes and outline areas of challenge for the\nfuture.\n", "  We bring resolution to the longstanding problem relating Fermi surface\nreconstruction to the number of holes contained within the Fermi surface volume\nin underdoped high Tc superconductors. On considering uniaxial and biaxial\ncharge-density wave order, we show that there exists a relationship between the\nordering wave vector, the hole doping and the cross-sectional area of the\nreconstructed Fermi surface whose precise form depends on the volume of the\nstarting Fermi surface. We consider a `large' starting Fermi surface comprising\n1+p hole carriers, as predicted by band structure calculations, and a `small'\nstarting Fermi surface comprising p hole carriers, as proposed in models in\nwhich the Coulomb repulsion remains the dominant energy. Using the\nreconstructed Fermi surface cross-sectional area obtained in quantum\noscillation experiments in YBa2Cu3O6+x and HgBa2CuO4+x and the established\nmethods for estimating the chemical hole doping, we find the ordering vectors\nobtained from x-ray scattering measurements to show a close correspondence with\nthose expected for the small starting Fermi surface. We therefore show the\nCoulomb repulsion to remain largely unscreened throughout the entire underdoped\nregime where the pseudogap exists and further show that the quantum oscillation\nfrequency and charge-density wave vectors provide accurate estimates for the\nnumber of holes contributing to the Fermi surface volume.\n", "  The extraction of the $B\\to K^*$ transition form factors from lattice data is\nstudied, applying non-relativistic effective field theory in a finite volume.\nThe possible mixing of $\\pi K$ and $\\eta K$ states is taken into account. The\ntwo-channel analogue of the Lellouch-L\\\"uscher formula is reproduced. Due to\nthe resonance nature of the $K^*$, an equation is derived, which allows to\ndetermine the form factors at the pole position in a process-independent\nmanner. The infinitely-narrow width approximation of the results is discussed.\n", "  In this paper the analogues of the Lorentz transformations for non-inertial\nreference frames have been obtained. A common case when the movement speed of\none coordinate frame in relation to another one can have time derivatives of\nhigher orders. The obtained transformations conserve invariance of the\nspace-time interval, and in the particular case of inertial frames become the\nwell-known Lorentz transformations. It is shown that the transition from\nclassical mechanics to the theory of relativity is analogous to the\nconsideration of the vibrating system described by the equation of the\nsine-Gordon type. In this case, if the amplitude of the elliptic functions is\n$k\\to 0$ the fluctuations can be considered small, and that leads to classical\nmechanics. With $k\\to 1$ time depends on the vibration amplitude, which leads\nto the theory of relativity. In the case of inertial frames the amplitude is\n$k=\\beta ={v}/{c}\\;$.\n", "  Vacancies in graphene have been proposed to give rise to $\\pi$-like magnetism\nin carbon materials, a conjecture which has been supported by recent\nexperimental evidence. A key element in this \"vacancy magnetism\" is the\nformation of magnetic moments in vacancy-induced electronic states. In this\nwork we compute the charging energy $U$ of a single-vacancy generated localized\nstate for bulk graphene and graphene ribbons. We use a tight-binding model to\ncalculate the dependency of the charging energy $U$ on the amplitudes of the\nlocalized wave function on the graphene lattice sites. We show that for bulk\ngraphene $U$ scales with the system size $L$ as $(\\ln L)^{-2}$, confirming the\npredictions in the literature, based on heuristic arguments. In contrast, we\nfind that for realistic system sizes $U$ is of the order of eV, a value that is\norders of magnitude higher than the previously reported estimates. Finally,\nwhen edges are considered, we show that $U$ is very sensitive to the vacancy\nposition with respect to the graphene flake boundaries. In the case of armchair\nnanoribbons, we find a strong enhancement of $U$ in certain vacancy positions\nas compared to the value for vacancies in bulk graphene.\n", "  We simulate entangled linear polymers in free-standing thin film geometries\nwhere the confining dimension is on the same scale or smaller than the bulk\nchain dimensions. We compare both film-averaged and layer-resolved, spatially\ninhomogeneous measures of the polymer structure and entanglement network with\ntheoretical models. We find that these properties are controlled by the ratio\nof both chain- and entanglement-strand length scales to the film thickness.\nWhile the film-averaged entanglement properties can be accurately predicted, we\nidentify outstanding challenges in understanding the spatially resolved\ncharacter of the heterogeneities in the entanglement network, particularly when\nthe scale of both the entanglement strand and the chain end-to-end vector is\ncomparable to or smaller than the film thickness.\n", "  Perturbative supersymmetric gauge coupling unification is possible in six\ntheories where complete SU(5) TeV-scale multiplets of vector matter account for\nthe size of the reported $750~{\\rm GeV}$ diphoton resonance, interpreted as a\nsinglet multiplet $S = (s+ia)/\\sqrt{2}$. One of these has a full generation of\nvector matter and a unified gauge coupling $\\alpha_G \\sim 1$. The diphoton\nsignal rate is enhanced by loops of vector squarks and sleptons, especially\nwhen the trilinear $A$ couplings are large. If the $SH_u H_d$ coupling is\nabsent, both $s$ and $a$ can contribute to the resonance, which may then have a\nlarge apparent width if the mass splitting from $s$ and $a$ arises from loops\nof vector matter. The width depends sensitively on $A$ parameters and phases of\nthe vector squark and slepton masses. Vector quarks and/or squarks are expected\nto be in reach of the LHC. If the $SH_uH_d$ coupling is present, $a$ leads to a\nnarrow diphoton resonance, while a second resonance with decays $s \\rightarrow\nhh, W^+ W^-,ZZ$ is likely to be discovered at future LHC runs. In some of the\ntheories a non-standard origin or running of the soft parameters is required,\nfor example involving conformal hidden sector interactions.\n", "  We present a study of the $S=-1$ meson-baryon interaction, employing a chiral\nSU(3) Lagrangian up to next-to-leading order (NLO) and implementing\nunitarization in coupled channels. The parameters of the model have been fitted\nto a large set of experimental scattering data in different two-body channels,\nto threshold branching ratios, and to the precise SIDDHARTA value of the energy\nshift and width of kaonic hidrogen. In contrast to other groups, we have taken\ninto consideration the $K^- p\\to K^+\\Xi^-, K^0\\Xi^0$ reaction data, since we\nfound in a previous work to be especially sensitive to the NLO parameters of\nthe chiral Lagrangian. In the present work we also include the Born terms,\nwhich usually have very little effect, and find them to be non-negligible in\nthe $K^- p\\to K\\Xi$ channels, correspondingly causing significant modifications\nto the NLO parameters. We furthermore show that the importance of the Born\nterms becomes more visible in the isospin projected amplitudes of the $K^-p \\to\nK\\Xi$ reactions. The measurement of processes that filter single isospin\ncomponents, like the $K^0_L p \\to K^+ \\Xi^0$ reaction that could be measured at\nthe proposed secondary $K^0_L$ beam at Jlab, would put valuable constraints on\nthe chiral models describing the meson-baryon interaction in the $S=-1$ sector.\n", "  Low-mass (sub-eV) spin-0 dark matter particles, which form a coherently\noscillating classical field $\\phi = \\phi_0 \\cos(m_\\phi t)$, can induce\noscillating variations in the fundamental constants through their interactions\nwith the Standard Model sector. We calculate the effects of such possible\ninteractions, which may include the linear interaction of $\\phi$ with the Higgs\nboson, on atomic and molecular transitions. Using recent atomic clock\nspectroscopy measurements, we derive new limits on the linear interaction of\n$\\phi$ with the Higgs boson, as well as its quadratic interactions with the\nphoton and light quarks. For the linear interaction of $\\phi$ with the Higgs\nboson, our derived limits improve on existing constraints by up to $2-3$ orders\nof magnitude.\n", "  In this work we present a modification to conventional X-rays fluorescence\nusing electrons as excitation source, and compare it with the traditional X-ray\nexcitation for the study of pigments. For this purpose we have constructed a\nlaser-based source capable to produce X-rays as well as electrons. Because of\nthe large penetration depth of X-rays, the collected fluorescence signal is a\ncombination of several material layers of the artwork under study. However\nelectrons are stopped in the first layers allowing therefore a more superficial\nanalysis. We show that the combination of both excitation sources can provide\nextremely valuable information about the structure of the artwork.\n", "  Direct numerical simulations are conducted for double diffusive convection\n(DDC) bounded by two parallel plates, with fluid properties similar to the\nvalues of seawater. The DDC flow is driven by an unstable salinity difference\nand stabilized at the same time by a temperature difference. For these\nconditions the flow can be in the finger regime. We develop scaling laws for\nthree key response parameters of the system: The non-dimensional salinity flux\n$Nu_S$ mainly depends on the salinity Rayleigh number $Ra_S$, which measures\nthe strength of the salinity difference, and exhibits a very weak dependence on\nthe density ratio $\\Lambda$, which is the ratio of the buoyancy forces induced\nby two scalar differences. The non-dimensional flow velocity $Re$ and the\nnon-dimensional heat flux $Nu_T$ are dependent on both $Ra_S$ and $\\Lambda$.\nHowever, the rescaled Reynolds number $Re\\Lambda^{\\alpha^{\\rm eff}_u}$ and the\nrescaled convective heat flux $(Nu_T-1)\\Lambda^{\\alpha^{\\rm eff}_T}$ depend\nonly on $Ra_S$. The two exponents are dependent on the fluid properties and are\ndetermined from the numerical results. Moreover, the behaviors of $Nu_S$ and\n$Re\\Lambda^{\\alpha^{\\rm eff}_u}$ agree with the predictions of the\nGrossmann-Lohse theory which was originally developed for the\nRayleigh-B\\'{e}nard flow. The non-dimensional salt-finger width and the\nthickness of the velocity boundary layers, after being rescaled by\n$\\Lambda^{\\alpha^{\\rm eff}_u/2}$, collapse and obey a similar power-law scaling\nrelation with $Ra_S$. When $Ra_S$ is large enough, salt fingers do not extend\nfrom one plate to the other and horizontal zonal flows emerge in the bulk\nregion. We then show that the current scaling strategy can be successfully\napplied to the experimental results of a heat-copper-ion system~(Hage and\nTilgner, Phys. Fluids, 22, 076603, 2010).\n", "  Understanding the formation and evolution of the first stars and galaxies\nrepresents one of the most exciting frontiers in astronomy. Since the universe\nwas filled with hydrogen atoms at early times, the most promising probe of the\nepoch of the first stars is the prominent 21-cm spectral line of hydrogen.\nCurrent observational efforts are focused on the cosmic reionization era, but\nobservations of the pre-reionization cosmic dawn are also promising. While\nobservationally unexplored, theoretical studies predict a rich variety of\nobservational signatures from cosmic dawn. As the first stars formed, their\nradiation (plus that from stellar remnants) produced significant cosmic events\nincluding Lyman-alpha coupling at z~25, and early X-ray heating. Much focus has\ngone to studying the angle-averaged power spectrum of 21-cm fluctuations.\nAdditional probes include the global (sky-averaged) 21-cm spectrum, and the\nline-of-sight anisotropy of the 21-cm power spectrum. A particularly striking\nsignature may result from the recently recognized effect of a supersonic\nrelative velocity between the dark matter and gas. Work in this field, focused\non understanding the whole era of reionization and cosmic dawn with analytical\nmodels and numerical simulations, is likely to grow in intensity and\nimportance, as the theoretical predictions are finally expected to confront\n21-cm observations in the coming years. [Abridged]\n", "  The intrinsic carrier transport dynamics in phosphorene is theoretically\nexamined. Utilizing a density functional theory treatment, the low-field\nmobility and the saturation velocity are characterized for both electrons and\nholes in the monolayer and bilayer structures. The analysis clearly elucidates\nthe crystal orientation dependence manifested through the anisotropic band\nstructure and the carrier-phonon scattering rates. In the monolayer, the hole\nmobility in the armchair direction is estimated to be approximately five times\nlarger than in the zigzag direction at room temperature (460 cm$^2$/Vs vs. 90\ncm$^2$/Vs). The bilayer transport, on the other hand, exhibits a more modest\nanisotropy with substantially higher mobilities (1610 cm$^2$/Vs and 760\ncm$^2$/Vs, respectively). The calculations on the conduction-band electrons\nindicate a comparable dependence while the characteristic values are generally\nsmaller by about a factor of two. The variation in the saturation velocity is\nfound to be less pronounced. With the anticipated superior performance and the\ndiminished anisotropy, few-layer phosphorene offers a promising opportunity\nparticularly in p-type applications.\n", "  We compute next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD corrections to the production of\ntwo massive electroweak bosons in gluon fusion. We consider both the prompt\nproduction process $gg \\to VV$ and the production mediated by an exchange of an\ns-channel Higgs boson, $gg \\to H^* \\to V V$. We include final states with both\non- and off-shell vector bosons with leptonic decays. The gluonic production of\nvector bosons is a loop-induced process, including both massless and massive\nquarks in the loop. For $gg \\to ZZ$ production, we obtain the NLO QCD\ncorrections to the massive loops through an expansion around the heavy top\nlimit. This approximation is valid below the top production threshold, giving a\nbroad range of invariant masses between the Higgs production and the top\nproduction thresholds in which our results are valid. We explore the NLO QCD\neffects in $gg \\to ZZ$ focusing, in particular, on the interference between\nprompt and Higgs-mediated processes. We find that the QCD corrections to the\ninterference are large and similar in size to the corrections to both the\nsignal and the background processes. At the same time, we observe that\ncorrections to the interference change rapidly with the four-lepton invariant\nmass in the region around the ZZ production threshold. We also study the\ninterference effects in $gg \\to WW$ production where, due to technical\nlimitations, we only consider contributions of massless loops. We find that the\nQCD corrections to the interference in this case are somewhat larger than those\nfor either the signal or the background.\n", "  We consider light propagation above the light line in arrays of spherical\ndielectric nanoparticles. It is demonstrated numerically that quasi-bound leaky\nmodes of the array can propagate both stationary waves and light pulses to a\ndistance of hundreds wavelengths at the frequencies close to the bound states\nin the radiation continuum. A semi-analytical estimate for decay rates of the\nguided waves is found to match the numerical data to a good accuracy.\n", "  Here we review the field of atom chips in the context of Bose-Einstein\nCondensates (BEC) as well as cold matter in general. Twenty years after the\nfirst realization of the BEC and fifteen years after the realization of the\natom chip, the latter has been found to enable extraordinary feats: from\nproducing BECs at a rate of several per second, through the realization of\nmatter-wave interferometry, and all the way to novel probing of surfaces and\nnew forces. In addition, technological applications are also being intensively\npursued. This review will describe these developments and more, including new\nideas which have not yet been realized.\n", "  The first technological SDHCAL prototype having been successfully tested, a\nnew phase of R&D, to validate completely the SDHCAL option for the\nInternational Linear Detector (ILD) project of the International Linear\nCollider (ILC), has started with the conception and the realisation of a new\nprototype. The new one is intended to host few but large active layers of the\nfuture SDHCAL. The new active layers, made of Glass Resistive Plate Chambers\n(GRPC) with sizes larger than 2m^2 will be equipped with a new version of the\nelectronic readout, fulfilling the requirements of the future ILD detector. The\nnew GRPC are conceived to improve the homogeneity with a new gas distribution\nscheme. Finally the mechanical structure will be achieved using the electron\nbeam welding technique. The progress realised will be presented and future\nsteps will be discussed.\n", "  We investigate the behavior of low energy photons radiated by the\ndeceleration processes of two colliding nuclei in relativistic heavy ion\ncollisions using the Wigner function approach for electromagnetic radiation\nfields. The angular distribution reveals the information of the initial\ngeometric configurations. Such a property is reflected in the anisotropic\nparameter $v_{2}$, showing an increasing $v_{2}$ as energy decreases, which is\na behavior qualitatively different from $v_{2}$ from hadrons produced in the\ncollisions.\n", "  We investigate antiferro quadrupole orders in a diamond lattice under\nmagnetic fields by Monte Carlo simulations for two types of classical effective\nmodels. One is an XY model with Z_3 anisotropy, and the other is a\ntwo-component phi^4 model with a third-order anisotropy. We confirm that the\nuniversality class of the zero-field transition is that for the\nthree-dimensional XY model. Magnetic field corresponds to a Z_3 field in the\neffective model, and under this field, we find that collinear and canted\nantiferro-quadrupole orders compete. Each phase is characterized by symmetry\nbreaking in the sector of (sublattice Z_2)x(reflection Z_2 for the order\nparameter). When Z_3 anisotropy and magnetic field vary, it turns out that this\nsystem is a good playground for various multicritical points; bicritical and\ntetracritical points emerge in a finite field. Another important finding is\nabout the scaling of parasitic ferro quadrupole order at the zero-field\ncritical point. This is the secondary order parameter induced by the primary\nantiferro order, and its critical exponent beta'=0.815 clearly differs from the\nexpected value that is twice the value for the primary order parameter. The\ncorresponding correlation length exponent is also different, nu'=0.597(12). We\nalso discuss relation of the present effective quadrupole models with the\n3-state Potts model as well as implication to undertanding of orbital orders in\nPr-based 1-2-20 compounds.\n", "  When comparing constraints on the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP)\nproperties from direct and indirect detection experiments it is crucial that\nthe assumptions made about the dark matter (DM) distribution are realistic and\nconsistent. For instance, if the Fermi-LAT Galactic centre GeV gamma-ray excess\nwas due to WIMP annihilation, its morphology would be incompatible with the\nStandard Halo Model that is usually used to interpret data from direct\ndetection experiments. In this article, we calculate exclusion limits from\ndirect detection experiments using self-consistent velocity distributions,\nderived from mass models of the Milky Way where the DM halo has a generalized\nNFW profile. We use two different methods to make the mass model compatible\nwith a DM interpretation of the Galactic centre gamma-ray excess. Firstly, we\nfix the inner slope of the DM density profile to the value that best fits the\nmorphology of the excess. Secondly, we allow the inner slope to vary and\ninclude the morphology of the excess in the data sets used to constrain the\ngravitational potential of the Milky Way. The resulting direct detection limits\ndiffer significantly from those derived using the Standard Halo Model, in\nparticular for light WIMPs, due to the differences in both the local DM density\nand velocity distribution.\n", "  We present a measurement of the volumetric rate of superluminous supernovae\n(SLSNe) at z~1, measured using archival data from the first four years of the\nCanada-France-Hawaii Telescope Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). We develop a\nmethod for the photometric classification of SLSNe to construct our sample. Our\nsample includes two previously spectroscopically-identified objects, and a\nfurther new candidate selected using our classification technique. We use the\npoint-source recovery efficiencies from Perrett et.al. (2010) and a Monte Carlo\napproach to calculate the rate based on our SLSN sample. We find that the three\nidentified SLSNe from SNLS give a rate of 91 (+76/-36) SNe/Yr/Gpc^3 at a\nvolume-weighted redshift of z=1.13. This is equivalent to 2.2 (+1.8/-0.9)\nx10^-4 of the volumetric core collapse supernova rate at the same redshift.\nWhen combined with other rate measurements from the literature, we show that\nthe rate of SLSNe increases with redshift in a manner consistent with that of\nthe cosmic star formation history. We also estimate the rate of ultra-long\ngamma ray bursts (ULGRBs) based on the events discovered by the Swift\nsatellite, and show that it is comparable to the rate of SLSNe, providing\nfurther evidence of a possible connection between these two classes of events.\nWe also examine the host galaxies of the SLSNe discovered in SNLS, and find\nthem to be consistent with the stellar-mass distribution of other published\nsamples of SLSNe.\n", "  We propose a minimal and motivated extension of the Standard Model\ncharacterised by an approximate lepton number conservation, which is able to\nsimultaneously generate neutrino masses and to account for a successful\nbaryogenesis via leptogenesis. The sterile fermions involved in the\nleptogenesis process have masses at the GeV scale. We determine the viable\nparameter space that complies with both the neutrino and baryogenesis\nphenomenology, and analyse the different regimes for the generation of a lepton\nasymmetry in the early Universe (weak and strong-washout) in order to determine\ntheir testability in future experimental facilities.\n", "  We announce the discovery of the Aquarius~2 dwarf galaxy, a new distant\nsatellite of the Milky Way, detected on the fringes of the VST ATLAS and the\nSDSS surveys. The object was originally identified as an overdensity of Red\nGiant Branch stars, but chosen for subsequent follow-up based on the presence\nof a strong Blue Horizontal Branch, which was also used to measure its distance\nof $\\sim 110$ kpc. Using deeper imaging from the IMACS camera on the 6.5m Baade\nand spectroscopy with DEIMOS on Keck, we measured the satellite's half-light\nradius $5.1\\pm 0.8$ arcmin, or $\\sim 160$ pc at this distance, and its stellar\nvelocity dispersion of $5.4^{+3.4}_{-0.9}$ km s$^{-1}$. With $\\mu=30.2$ mag\narcsec$^{-2}$ and $M_V=-4.36$, the new satellite lies close to two important\ndetection limits: one in surface brightness; and one in luminosity at a given\ndistance, thereby making Aquarius~2 one of the hardest dwarfs to find.\n", "  The striking behavior of water has deserved it to be referred to as an\n\"anomalous\" liquid. The water anomalies are greatly amplified in metastable\n(supercooled/stretched) regions. This makes difficult a complete experimental\ndescription since, beyond certain limits, the metastable phase necessarily\ntransforms into the stable one. Theoretical interpretation of the water\nanomalies could then be based on simulation results of well validated water\nmodels. But the analysis of the simulations has not yet reached a consensus. In\nparticular, one of the most popular theoretical scenarios -involving the\nexistence of a liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP)- is disputed by several\nauthors. In this work we propose to use a number of exact thermodynamic\nrelations which can be tested in a region of the phase diagram outside the LLCP\nthus avoiding the problems associated to the coexistence region. The central\nproperty connected to other water anomalies is the locus of temperatures at\nwhich the density along isobars attain a maximum (TMD line) or a minimum (TmD),\ncomputed via simulations for a successful water model, TIP4P/2005. Next, we\nhave evaluated the vapor-liquid spinodal in the region of large negative\npressures. The shape of these curves and their connection to the extrema of\nresponse functions (isothermal compressibility and heat capacity at constant\npressure) may help to elucidate the validity of the theoretical proposals. In\nthis way we are able to present for the first time a comprehensive scenario of\nthe thermodynamic water anomalies for TIP4P/2005 and their relation to the\nvapor-liquid spinodal. The overall picture shows a remarkable similarity with\nthe corresponding one for the ST2 water model, for which the existence of a\nLLCP has been demonstrated in recent years. It also provides a hint as to where\nthe long-sought for extrema in response functions might become accessible to\nexperiments.\n", "  Magnetic properties of single crystals of Mn$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Si solid solutions\nwith $x < 0.2$ are investigated by pulsed field technique in magnetic fields up\nto 50 T. It is shown that magnetization of Mn$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Si in the\nparamagnetic phase follows power law $M(B) \\sim B^\\alpha$ with the exponents\n$\\alpha \\sim 0.33-0.5$, which starts above characteristic fields $B_c \\sim\n1.5-7$ T depending on the sample composition and lasts up to highest used\nmagnetic field. Analysis of magnetization data including SQUID measurements in\nmagnetic fields below 5 T suggests that this anomalous behavior may be likely\nattributed to the formation of a field-induced Griffiths phase in the presence\nof spin-polaron effects.\n", "  We calculate analytically the flavor non-singlet $O(\\alpha_s^2)$ massive\nWilson coefficients for the inclusive neutral current non-singlet structure\nfunctions $F_{1,2,L}^{ep}(x,Q^2)$ and $g_{1,2}^{ep}(x,Q^2)$ and charged current\nnon-singlet structure functions $F_{1,2,3}^{\\nu(\\bar{\\nu})p}(x,Q^2)$, at\ngeneral virtualities $Q^2$ in the deep-inelastic region. Numerical results are\npresented. We illustrate the transition from low to large virtualities for\nthese observables, which may be contrasted to basic assumptions made in the\nso-called variable flavor number scheme. We also derive the corresponding\nresults for the Adler sum rule, the unpolarized and polarized Bjorken sum rules\nand the Gross-Llewellyn Smith sum rule. There are no logarithmic corrections at\nlarge scales $Q^2$ and the effects of the power corrections due to the heavy\nquark mass are of the size of the known $O(\\alpha_s^4)$ corrections in the case\nof the sum rules. The complete charm and bottom corrections are compared to the\napproach using asymptotic representations in the region $Q^2 \\gg m_{c,b}^2$. We\nalso study the target mass corrections to the above sum rules.\n", "  Over the past years, the interpretation of measurements in the context of\neffective field theories has attracted much attention in the field of particle\nphysics. We present a tool for interpreting sets of measurements in such models\nusing a Bayesian ansatz by calculating the posterior probabilities of the\ncorresponding free parameters numerically. An example is given, in which\ntop-quark measurements are used to constrain anomalous couplings at the\nWtb-vertex.\n", "  We introduce a mean field model based on realistic 2-body baryon interactions\nand calculate spectra of a set of p-shell and sd-shell {\\Lambda} hypernuclei -\n13{\\Lambda}C, 17{\\Lambda}O, 21{\\Lambda}Ne, 29{\\Lambda}Si and 41{\\Lambda}Ca. The\nhypernuclear spectra are compared with the results of a relativistic mean field\n(RMF) model and available experimental data. The sensitivity of {\\Lambda}\nsingle-particle energies to the nuclear core structure is explored. Special\nattention is paid to the effect of spin-orbit {\\Lambda}N interaction on the\nenergy splitting of the {\\Lambda} single particle levels 0p3/2 and 0p1/2. In\nparticular, we analyze the contribution of the symmetric (SLS) and the\nanti-symmetric (ALS) spin-orbit terms to the energy splitting. We give\nqualitative predictions for the calculated hypernuclei.\n", "  The results of a study that helps understand the mechanisms of adsorption of\npolyelectrolytes on particles, using numerical simulation methods, specifically\nthe one known as dissipative particle dynamics are reported here. The\nadsorption of cationic polyelectrolytes of two different polymerization degrees\ninteracting with two types of surfaces, one made of gold and the other of\nsilica is predicted and compared. We find that a more negatively charged wall\ndoes not necessarily adsorb more cationic polyelectrolytes because the\nelectrostatic repulsion between the wall and the polyelectrolytes is stronger.\nAdditionally, intra chain repulsion plays an important role, because the\nlargest polyelectrolyte chains have larger excluded volume than the shorter\nones. In regard to the adsorption dependence on the polyelectrolyte\npolymerization degree we find that the excluded volume drives the adsorption\nthroughout the intrachain electrostatic repulsion, because the SiO2 surface is\nstrongly negative. These results are expected to be useful for several\nnanotechnological applications of current interest, such as in gene therapy and\nin the improvement of drug delivering mechanisms.\n", "  We present a theory of the anomalous Hall effect in a topological Weyl\nsuperconductor with broken time reversal symmetry. Specifically, we consider a\nferromagnetic Weyl metal with two Weyl nodes of opposite chirality near the\nFermi energy. In the presence of inversion symmetry, such a metal experiences a\nweak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) instability, with pairing of\nparity-related eigenstates. Due to the nonzero topological charge, carried by\nthe Weyl nodes, such a superconductor is necessarily topologically nontrivial,\nwith Majorana surface states coexisting with the Fermi arcs of the normal Weyl\nmetal. We demonstrate that, surprisingly, the anomalous Hall conductivity of\nsuch a superconducting Weyl metal coincides with that of a nonsuperconducting\none, under certain conditions, in spite of the nonconservation of charge in a\nsuperconductor. We relate this to the existence of an extra (nearly) conserved\nquantity in a Weyl metal, the chiral charge.\n", "  We study the dark exciton's behavior as a coherent physical two-level spin\nsystem (qubit) using an external magnetic field in the Faraday configuration.\nOur studies are based on polarization-sensitive intensity autocorrelation\nmeasurements of the optical transition resulting from the recombination of a\nspin-blockaded biexciton state, which heralds the dark exciton and its spin\nstate. We demonstrate control over the dark exciton eigenstates without\ndegrading its decoherence time. Our observations agree well with computational\npredictions based on a master equation model.\n", "  Adiabatic approximations in time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)\nwill in general yield unphysical time-dependent shifts in the resonance\npositions of a system driven far from its ground-state. This spurious\ntime-dependence is rationalized in [J. I. Fuks, K. Luo, E. D. Sandoval and N.\nT. Maitra, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 114}, 183002 (2015)] in terms of the violation\nof an exact condition by the non-equilibrium exchange-correlation kernel of\nTDDFT. Here we give details on the derivation and discuss reformulations of the\nexact condition that apply in special cases. In its most general form, the\ncondition states that when a system is left in an arbitrary state, in the\nabsence of time-dependent external fields nor ionic motion, the TDDFT resonance\nposition for a given transition is independent of the state. Special cases\ninclude the invariance of TDDFT resonances computed with respect to any\nreference interacting stationary state of a fixed potential, and with respect\nto any choice of appropriate stationary Kohn-Sham reference state. We then\npresent several case studies, including one that utilizes the\nadiabatically-exact approximation, that illustrate the conditions and the\nimpact of their violation on the accuracy of the ensuing dynamics. In\nparticular, charge-transfer across a long-range molecule is hampered, and we\nshow how adjusting the frequency of a driving field to match the time-dependent\nshift in the charge-transfer resonance frequency, results in a larger charge\ntransfer over time.\n", "  We present how the thermal geometry emerges from CFT at finite temperature by\nusing the truncated entanglement renormalization network, the cMERA. For the\ncase of $2d$ CFT, the reduced geometry is the BTZ black hole or the thermal AdS\nas expectation. In order to determine which spacetimes prefer to form, we\npropose a cMERA description of the Hawking-Page phase transition. Our proposal\nis in agreement with the picture of the recent proposed surface/state\ncorrespondence.\n", "  A \"minimum model\" for debris disks consists of a narrow ring of parent\nbodies, secularly forced by a single planet on a possibly eccentric orbit,\ncolliding to produce dust grains that are perturbed by stellar radiation\npressure. We demonstrate how this minimum model can reproduce a wide variety of\ndisk morphologies imaged in scattered starlight. Five broad categories of disk\nshape can be captured: \"rings,\" \"needles,\" \"ships-and-wakes,\" \"bars,\" and\n\"moths (a.k.a. fans),\" depending on the viewing geometry. Moths can also sport\n\"double wings.\" We explain the origin of morphological features from first\nprinciples, exploring the dependence on planet eccentricity, disk inclination\ndispersion, and the parent body orbital phases at which dust grains are born. A\nkey determinant in disk appearance is the degree to which dust grain orbits are\napsidally aligned. Our study of a simple steady-state (secularly relaxed) disk\nshould serve as a reference for more detailed models tailored to individual\nsystems. We use the intuition gained from our guidebook of disk morphologies to\ninterpret, informally, the images of a number of real-world debris disks. These\ninterpretations suggest that the farthest reaches of planetary systems are\nperturbed by eccentric planets, possibly just a few Earth masses each.\n", "  The study of carbon and oxygen abundances yields information on the time\nevolution and nucleosynthetic origins of these elements, yet remains relatively\nunexplored. At low metallicities (12+log(O/H) < 8.0), nebular carbon\nmeasurements are limited to rest-frame UV collisionally excited emission lines.\nTherefore, we present UV spectrophotometry of 12 nearby, low-metallicity,\nhigh-ionization HII regions in dwarf galaxies obtained with the Cosmic Origins\nSpectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. We present the first analysis of\nthe C/O ratio in local galaxies based solely on simultaneous significant\ndetections of the UV O^+2 and C^+2 collisionally excited lines in seven of our\ntargets and five objects from the literature, to create a final sample of 12\nsignificant detections. Our sample is complemented by optical SDSS spectra,\nfrom which we measured the nebular physical conditions and oxygen abundances\nusing the direct method.\n  At low metallicity (12+log(O/H) < 8.0), no clear trend is evident in C/O vs.\nO/H for the present sample given the large dispersion observed. When combined\nwith recombination line observations at higher values of O/H, a general trend\nof increasing C/O with increasing O/H is also viable, but with some significant\noutliers. Additionally, we find the C/N ratio appears to be constant (but with\nsignificant scatter) over a large range in oxygen abundance, indicating carbon\nis predominantly produced by similar nucleosynthetic mechanisms as nitrogen. If\ntrue, and our current understanding of nitrogen production is correct, this\nwould indicate that primary production of carbon (a flat trend) dominates at\nlow metallicity, but quasi-secondary production (an increasing trend) becomes\nprominent at higher metallicities. A larger sample will be needed to determine\nthe true nature and dispersion of the relation.\n", "  We summarise the evolution and nucleosynthesis in AGB and Super-AGB stars. We\nthen examine the major sources of uncertainty, especially mass-loss.\n", "  Which gain and phase have to be set for a bunch-by-bunch transverse damper,\nand at which chromaticity it is better to stay? These questions are considered\nfor three models: the two-particle model with possible quadrupole wake, the\nauthor's Nested Head-Tail Vlasov solver with a broadband impedance, and the\nsame with the LHC impedance model.\n", "  We theoretically study the propagation of light through a cold atomic medium,\nwhere the effects of motion, laser intensity, atomic density, and polarization\ncan all modify the properties of the scattered light. We present two different\nmicroscopic models: the \"coherent dipole model\" and the \"random walk model\",\nboth suitable for modeling recent experimental work done in large atomic arrays\nin the low light intensity regime. We use them to compute relevant observables\nsuch as the linewidth, peak intensity and line center of the emitted light. We\nfurther develop generalized models that explicitly take into account atomic\nmotion. Those are relevant for hotter atoms and beyond the low intensity\nregime. We show that atomic motion can lead to drastic dephasing and to a\nreduction of collective effects, together with a distortion of the lineshape.\nOur results are applicable to model a full gamut of quantum systems that rely\non atom-light interactions including atomic clocks, quantum simulators and\nnanophotonic systems.\n", "  We investigate the possibility to achieve high-fidelity universal two-qubit\ngates by supplementing optimal tuning of individual qubits with dynamical\ndecoupling (DD) of local 1/f noise. We consider simultaneous local pulse\nsequences applied during the gate operation and compare the efficiencies of\nperiodic, Carr-Purcell and Uhrig DD with hard $\\pi$-pulses along two directions\n($\\pi_{z/y}$ pulses). We present analytical perturbative results (Magnus\nexpansion) in the quasi-static noise approximation combined with numerical\nsimulations for realistic 1/f noise spectra. The gate efficiency is studied as\na function of the gate duration, of the number $n$ of pulses, and of the\nhigh-frequency roll-off. We find that the gate error is non-monotonic in $n$,\ndecreasing as $n^{-\\alpha}$ in the asymptotic limit, $\\alpha \\geq 2$ depending\non the DD sequence. In this limit $\\pi_z$-Urhig is the most efficient scheme\nfor quasi-static 1/f noise, but it is highly sensitive to the soft UV-cutoff.\nFor small number of pulses, $\\pi_z$ control yields anti-Zeno behavior, whereas\n$\\pi_y$ pulses minimize the error for a finite $n$. For the current noise\nfigures in superconducting qubits, two-qubit gate errors $\\sim 10^{-6}$,\nmeeting the requirements for fault-tolerant quantum computation, can be\nachieved. The Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequence is the most efficient\nprocedure, stable for $1/f$ noise with UV-cutoff up to gigahertz.\n", "  The type X (lepton-specific) two-Higgs-doublet model at large $\\tan\\beta$\nbecomes leptophilic and thus allows a light pseudoscalar $A$ accommodating the\nobserved muon $g-2$ deviation without conflicting with various hadronic\nconstraints. On the other hand, it is strongly constrained by leptonic\nprecision observables such as lepton universality test in the neutral and\ncharged currents. Treating all the lepton universality data in a consistent\nway, we show how the current data constrain the parameter space of $m_A$ and\n$\\tan\\beta$ for given degenerate masses of heavy Higgs bosons $H$ and $H^\\pm$.\nWhile no overlapping region is found at $1\\sigma$, a sizable region is still\nviable at $2\\sigma$ for $H/H^\\pm$ masses at around 200$\\sim$400 GeV.\n", "  We develop an analytical approach to the exciton optical absorption for\nnarrow gap armchair graphene nanoribbons (AGNR). We focus on the regime of\ndominant size quantization in combination with the attractive electron-hole\ninteraction. An adiabatic separation of slow and fast motions leads via the\ntwo-body Dirac equation to the isolated and coupled subband approximations.\nDiscrete and continuous exciton states are in general coupled and form quasi\nRydberg series of purely discrete and resonance type character. Corresponding\noscillator strengths and widths are derived. We show that the exciton peaks are\nblue-shifted, become broader and increase in magnitude upon narrowing the\nribbon. At the edge of a subband the singularity related to the 1D density of\nstates is transformed into finite absorption via the presence of the exciton.\nOur analytical results are in good agreement with those obtained by other\nmethods including numerical approaches. Estimates of the expected experimental\nvalues are provided for realistic AGNRs.\n", "  The outstanding optical properties for plasmon resonances in noble metal\nnanoparticles enable the observation of non-linear optical processes such as\nsecond-harmonic generation (SHG) at the nanoscale. Here, we investigate the SHG\nprocess in single rectangular aluminum nanoantennas and demonstrate that i) a\ndoubly resonant regime can be achieved in very compact nanostructures, yielding\na 7.5 enhancement compared to singly resonant structures and ii) the\n\\(\\chi_{\\perp\\perp\\perp}\\) local surface and \\(\\gamma_{bulk}\\) nonlocal bulk\ncontributions can be separated while imaging resonant nanostructures excited by\na tightly focused beam, provided the \\(\\chi_{\\perp\\parallel\\parallel}\\) local\nsurface is assumed to be zero, as it is the case in all existing models for\nmetals. Thanks to the quantitative agreement between experimental and simulated\nfar-field SHG maps, taking into account the real experimental configuration\n(focusing and substrate), we identify the physical origin of the SHG in\naluminum nanoantennas as arising mainly from \\(\\chi_{\\perp\\perp\\perp}\\) local\nsurface sources.\n", "  We study theoretically the characteristics of surface waves excited at the\ninterface between a metal and a general bi-isotropic medium, which includes\nisotropic chiral media and Tellegen media as special cases. We derive an\nanalytical dispersion relation for surface waves, using which we calculate the\neffective index and the propagation length numerically. We also calculate the\nabsorptance, the cross-polarized reflectance and the spatial distribution of\nthe electromagnetic fields for plane waves incident on a bilayer system\nconsisting of a metal layer and a bi-isotropic layer in the Kretschmann\nconfiguration, using the invariant imbedding method. The results obtained using\nthe invariant imbedding method agree with those obtained from the dispersion\nrelation perfectly. In the case of chiral media, the effective index is an\nincreasing function of the chirality index, whereas in Tellegen media, it is a\ndecreasing function of the Tellegen parameter. The propagation length for\nsurface waves in both cases increase substantially as either the chirality\nindex or the Tellegen parameter increases. In Tellegen media, it diverges to\ninfinity when the effective index goes to zero, whereas in chiral media, it\ndoes when the parameters approach the cutoff values where quasi surface waves\nare excited. We investigate the characteristics of quasi surface waves excited\nwhen the chirality index is sufficiently large.\n", "  Integration of complex photonic structures onto optical fiber facets enables\npowerful platforms with unprecedented optical functionalities. Conventional\nnanofabrication technologies, however, do not permit viable integration of\ncomplex photonic devices onto optical fibers owing to their low throughput and\nhigh cost. In this paper we report the fabrication of a three dimensional\nstructure achieved by direct Nanoimprint Lithography on the facet of an optical\nfiber. Nanoimprint processes and tools were specifically developed to enable a\nhigh lithographic accuracy and coaxial alignment of the optical device with\nrespect to the fiber core. To demonstrate the capability of this new approach,\na 3D beam splitter has been designed, imprinted and optically characterized.\nScanning electron microscopy and optical measurements confirmed the excellent\nlithographic capabilities of the proposed approach as well as the desired\noptical performance of the imprinted structure. The inexpensive solution\npresented here should enable advancements in areas such as integrated optics\nand sensing, achieving enhanced portability and versatility of fiber optic\ncomponents.\n", "  The image subtraction technique applied to study variable stars in globular\nclusters represented a leap in the number of new detections, with the drawback\nthat many of these new light curves could not be transformed to magnitudes due\nto the severe crowding. In this paper we present observations of four Galactic\nglobular clusters, M 2 (NGC 7089), M 10 (NGC 6254), M 80 (NGC 6093) and NGC\n1261, taken with the ground-layer adaptive optics module at the SOAR Telescope,\nSAM. We show that the higher image quality provided by SAM allows the\ncalibration of the light curves of the great majority of the variables near the\ncores of these clusters as well as the detection of new variables even in\nclusters where image-subtraction searches were already conducted. We report the\ndiscovery of 15 new variables in M 2 (12 RR Lyrae stars and 3 SX Phe stars), 12\nnew variables in M 10 (11 SX Phe and one long-period variable) and one new W\nUMa-type variable in NGC 1261. No new detections are found in M 80, but\nprevious uncertain detections are confirmed and the corresponding light curves\nare calibrated into magnitudes. Additionally, based on the number of detected\nvariables and new HST/UVIS photometry, we revisit a previous suggestion that M\n80 may be the globular cluster with the richest population of blue stragglers\nin our Galaxy.\n", "  Data of the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation\nof a system containing one spin-1/2 particle interacting with a bath of up to\n32 spin-1/2 particles is used to construct a Markovian quantum master equation\ndescribing the dynamics of the system spin. The procedure of obtaining this\nquantum master equation, which takes the form of a Bloch equation with\ntime-independent coefficients, accounts for all non-Markovian effects in as\nmuch the general structure of the quantum master equation allows. Our\nsimulation results show that, with a few rather exotic exceptions, the\nBloch-type equation with time-independent coefficients provides a simple and\naccurate description of the dynamics of a spin-1/2 particle in contact with a\nthermal bath. A calculation of the coefficients that appear in the Redfield\nmaster equation in the Markovian limit shows that this perturbatively derived\nequation quantitatively differs from the numerically estimated Markovian master\nequation, the results of which agree very well with the solution of the\ntime-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation.\n", "  We present a minimally parametric, model independent reconstruction of the\nshape of the primordial power spectrum. Our smoothing spline technique is\nwell-suited to search for smooth features such as deviations from scale\ninvariance, and deviations from a power law such as running of the spectral\nindex or small-scale power suppression. We use a comprehensive set of the\nstate-of the art cosmological data: {\\it Planck} observations of the\ntemperature and polarisation anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background,\nWiggleZ and Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 galaxy power spectra and\nthe Canada-France-Hawaii Lensing Survey correlation function. This\nreconstruction strongly supports the evidence for a power law primordial power\nspectrum with a red tilt and disfavours deviations from a power law power\nspectrum including small-scale power suppression such as that induced by\nsignificantly massive neutrinos. This offers a powerful confirmation of the\ninflationary paradigm, justifying the adoption of the inflationary prior in\ncosmological analyses.\n", "  We report on experimental observations of flow induced large amplitude\ndust-acoustic shock waves (DASW) in a complex plasma. The experiments have been\ncarried out in a $\\Pi$ shaped DC glow discharge experimental device using\nkaolin particles as the dust component in a background of Argon plasma. A\nstrong supersonic flow of the dust fluid is induced by adjusting the pumping\nspeed and neutral gas flow into the device. An isolated copper wire mounted on\nthe cathode acts as a potential barrier to the flow of dust particles. A sudden\nchange of gas flow rate is used to trigger the onset of high velocity dust\nacoustic shocks whose dynamics are captured by fast video pictures of the\nevolving structures. The physical characteristics of these shocks are\ndelineated through a parametric scan of their dynamical properties over a range\nof flow speeds and potential hill heights. The observed evolution of the shock\nwaves and their propagation characteristics are found to compare well with\nmodel numerical results based on a modified Korteweg-de-Vries-Burgers type\nequation.\n", "  Entanglement of charge orderings and other electronic orders such as\nsuperconductivity is in the core of challenging physics issues of complex\nmaterials including high temperature superconductivity. Here, we report on the\nobservation of a unique nanometer scale honeycomb charge ordering of the\ncleaved IrTe2 surface, which hosts a superconducting state. IrTe2 was recently\nestablished to exhibit an intriguing cascade of stripe charge orders. The\nstripe phases coexist with a hexagonal phase, which is formed locally and falls\ninto a superconducting state below 3 K. The atomic and electronic structures of\nthe honeycomb and hexagon pattern of this phase are consistent with the charge\norder nature but the superconductivity does not survive on neighboring stripe\ncharge order domains. The present work provides an intriguing physics issue and\na new direction of functionalization for two dimensional materials.\n", "  The study considers advantages of the introduced measure of time based on the\nentropy change under irreversible processes (entropy production). Using the\nexample of non-equilibrium expansion of an ideal gas in vacuum, such a measure\nis introduced with the help of Boltzmann's classic entropy. It is shown that,\nin the general case, this measure of time proves to be nonlinearly related to\nthe reference measure assumed uniform by convention. The connection between\nthis result and the results of other authors investigating measure of time in\nsome biological and cosmological problems is noted.\n", "  We explore various non-supersymmetric type II string vacua constructed based\non asymmetric orbifolds of tori with vanishing cosmological constant at the one\nloop. The string vacua we present are modifications of the models studied in\narXiv:1512.05155[hep-th], of which orbifold group is just generated by a single\nelement. We especially focus on two types of modifications: (i) the orbifold\ntwists include different types of chiral reflections not necessarily removing\nmassless Rarita-Schwinger fields in the 4-dimensional space-time, (ii) the\norbifold twists do not include the shift operator. We further discuss the\nunitarity and stability of constructed non-supersymmetric string vacua, with\nemphasizing the common features of them.\n", "  The Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo (FCIQMC) method has\nproved able to provide near-exact solutions to the electronic Schr\\\"odinger\nequation within a finite orbital basis set, without relying on an expansion\nabout a reference state. However, a drawback to the approach is that being\nbased on an expansion of Slater determinants, the FCIQMC method suffers from a\nbasis set incompleteness error that decays very slowly with the size of the\nemployed single particle basis. The FCIQMC results obtained in a small basis\nset can be improved significantly with explicitly correlated techniques. Here,\nwe present a study that assesses and compares two contrasting `universal'\nexplicitly correlated approaches that fit into the FCIQMC framework; the\n$[2]_{R12}$ method of Valeev {\\em et al.}, and the explicitly correlated\ncanonical transcorrelation approach of Yanai {\\em et al}. The former is an {\\em\na posteriori} internally-contracted perturbative approach, while the latter\ntransforms the Hamiltonian prior to the FCIQMC simulation. These comparisons\nare made across the 55 molecules of the G1 standard set. We found that both\nmethods consistently reduce the basis set incompleteness, for accurate\natomization energies in small basis sets, reducing the error from 28~mE$_{\\text\nh}$ to 3-4~mE$_{\\text h}$. While many of the conclusions hold in general for\nany combination of multireference approaches with these methodologies, we also\nconsider FCIQMC-specific advantages of each approach.\n", "  We use a recently proposed method called Spectral Gap Optimization of Order\nParameters (SGOOP) (Tiwary and Berne, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci 2016, 113, 2839\n(2016)), to determine an optimal 1-dimensional reaction coordinate (RC) for the\nunbinding of a bucky-ball from a pocket in explicit water. This RC is estimated\nas a linear combination of the multiple available order parameters that\ncollectively can be used to distinguish the various stable states relevant for\nunbinding. We pay special attention to determining and quantifying the degree\nto which water molecules should be included in the RC. Using SGOOP with\nunder-sampled biased simulations, we predict that water plays a distinct role\nin the reaction coordinate for unbinding in the case when the ligand is\nsterically constrained to move along an axis of symmetry. This prediction is\nvalidated through extensive calculations of the unbinding times through\nmetadynamics, and by comparison through detailed balance with unbiased\nmolecular dynamics estimate of the binding time. However when the steric\nconstraint is removed, we find that the role of water in the reaction\ncoordinate diminishes. Here instead SGOOP identifies a good one-dimensional RC\ninvolving various motional degrees of freedom.\n", "  The liquid water habitable zone (HZ) describes the orbital distance at which\na terrestrial planet can maintain above-freezing conditions through regulation\nby the carbonate-silicate cycle. Recent calculations have suggested that\nplanets in the outer regions of the habitable zone cannot maintain stable, warm\nclimates, but rather should oscillate between long, globally glaciated states\nand shorter periods of climatic warmth. Such conditions, similar to 'Snowball\nEarth' episodes experienced on Earth, would be inimical to the development of\ncomplex land life, including intelligent life. Here, we build upon previous\nstudies with an updated an energy balance climate model to calculate this\n'limit cycle' region of the habitable zone where such cycling would occur. We\nargue that an abiotic Earth would have a greater CO$_2$ partial pressure than\ntoday because plants and other biota help to enhance the storage of CO$_2$ in\nsoil. When we tune our abiotic model accordingly, we find that limit cycles can\noccur but that previous calculations have overestimated their importance. For G\nstars like the Sun, limit cycles occur only for planets with CO$_2$ outgassing\nrates less than that on modern Earth. For K and M star planets, limit cycles\nshould not occur; however, M-star planets may be inhospitable to life for other\nreasons. Planets orbiting late G-type and early K-type stars retain the\ngreatest potential for maintaining warm, stable conditions. Our results suggest\nthat host star type, planetary volcanic activity, and seafloor weathering are\nall important factors in determining whether planets will be prone to limit\ncycling.\n", "  In this paper, we realize the concept of analog computing using an array of\nengineered gradient dielectric meta-reflect-array. The proposed configuration\nconsists of individual subwavelength silicon nanobricks in combination with\nfused silica spacer and silver ground plane realizing a reflection beam with\nfull phase coverage $2\\pi$ degrees as well as amplitude range $0$ to $1$.\nSpectrally overlapping electric and magnetic dipole resonances, such high-index\ndielectric metasurfaces can locally and independently manipulate the amplitude\nand phase of the incident electromagnetic wave. This practically feasible\nstructure overcomes substantial limitations imposed by plasmonic metasurfaces\nsuch as absorption losses and low polarization conversion efficiency in the\nvisible range. Using such CMOS-compatible and easily integrable platforms\npromises highly efficient ultrathin planar wave-based computing systems which\ncircumvent the drawbacks of conventional bulky lens-based signal processors.\nBased on these key properties and general concept of spatial Fourier\ntransformation, we design and realize broadband mathematical operators such as\ndifferentiator and integrator in the telecommunication wavelengths.\n", "  Statistical distribution of switching times is a key information necessary to\ndescribe the dynamic response of a polycrystalline bulk ferroelectric to an\napplied electric field. The Inhomogeneous Field Mechanism (IFM) model offers a\nuseful tool which allows extraction of this information from polarization\nswitching measurements over a large time window. In this paper, the model was\nfurther developed to account for the presence of non-switchable regions in\nfatigued materials. Application of the IFM- analysis to bipolar electric\ncycling induced fatigue process of various lead-based and lead-free\nferroelectric ceramics reveals different scenarios of property degradation.\nInsight is gained into different underlying fatigue mechanisms inherent to the\ninvestigated systems.\n", "  The production cross sections for primary and residual fragments with charge\nnumber from $Z$=70 to 120 produced in the collision of $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U at\n7.0 MeV/nucleon are calculated by the improved quantum molecular dynamics\n(ImQMD) model incorporated with the statistical evaporation model (HIVAP code).\nThe calculation results predict that about sixty unknown neutron-rich isotopes\nfrom element Ra ($Z$=88) to Db ($Z$=105) can be produced with the production\ncross sections above the lower bound of $10^{-8}$ mb in this reaction. And\nalmost all of unknown neutron-rich isotopes are emitted at the laboratory\nangles $\\theta_{lab}\\leq$ 60$^\\circ$. Two cases, i.e. the production of the\nunknown uranium isotopes with $A\\geq$ 244 and that of rutherfordium with\n$A\\geq$ 269 are investigated for understanding the production mechanism of\nunknown neutron-rich isotopes. It is found that for the former case the\ncollision time between two uranium nuclei is shorter and the primary fragments\nproducing the residues have smaller excitation energies of $\\leq$ 30 MeV and\nthe outgoing angles of those residues cover a range of 30$^\\circ$-60$^\\circ$.\nFor the later case, the longer collision time is needed for a large number of\nnucleons being transferred and thus it results in the higher excitation\nenergies and smaller outgoing angles of primary fragments, and eventually\nresults in a very small production cross section for the residues of Rf with\n$A\\geq$ 269 which have a small interval of outgoing angles of\n$\\theta_{lab}$=40$^\\circ$-50$^\\circ$.\n", "  We make an explicit link between the cubic interactions of off-shell fields\nand the on-shell three-point amplitudes in four dimensions. Both the cubic\ninteractions and the on-shell three-point amplitudes had been independently\nclassified in the literature, but their relation has not been made explicit.\nThe aim of this note is to provide such a relation and discuss similarities and\ndifferences of their constructions. For the completeness of our analysis, we\nalso derive the covariant form of all parity-odd massless vertices.\n", "  As a Newtonian cosmological model the Vlasov-Poisson-Boltzmann system is\nconsidered, and a slightly modified Boltzmann equation, which describes the\nstability of an expanding universe, is derived. Asymptotic behaviour of\nsolutions turns out to depend on the expansion of the universe, and in this\npaper we consider the soft potential case and will obtain asymptotic behaviour.\n", "  Asymmetries in heavy quark pair and dijet production in electron-proton\ncollisions allow studies of gluon TMDs in close analogy to studies of quark\nTMDs in semi-inclusive DIS. Here we present expressions for azimuthal\nasymmetries for both unpolarized and transversely polarized proton cases and\nconsider the maximal asymmetries allowed. The latter are found to be rather\nsizeable, except in certain kinematic limits which are pointed out. In\naddition, we consider the small-x limit and expectations from a\nMcLerran-Venugopalan model for unpolarized and linearly polarized gluons and\nfrom a perturbative, large transverse momentum calculation for the T-odd gluon\nTMDs. Comparison to related observables at RHIC and LHC is expected to provide\nvaluable information about the process dependence of the gluon TMDs. In\nparticular this will offer the possibility of a sign change test of the gluon\nSivers TMD and two other T-odd gluon TMDs. This provides additional motivation\nfor studies of azimuthal asymmetries in heavy quark pair and dijet production\nat a future Electron-Ion Collider.\n", "  We explore the ability of the high luminosity LHC to test models which can\nexplain the 750 GeV diphoton excess. We focus on a wide class of models where a\n750 GeV singlet scalar couples to Standard Model gauge bosons and quarks, as\nwell as dark matter. Including both gluon and photon fusion production\nmechanisms, we show that LHC searches in channels correlated with the diphoton\nsignal will be able to probe wide classes of diphoton models with $\\mathcal{L}\n\\sim 3000\\, \\text{fb}^{-1}$ of data. Furthermore, models in which the scalar is\na portal to the dark sector can be cornered with as little as $\\mathcal{L} \\sim\n30\\, \\text{fb}^{-1}$.\n", "  The semiclassical $\\hbar$-expansion of the one-particle density matrix for a\ntwo-dimensional Fermi gas is calculated within the Wigner transform method of\nGrammaticos and Voros, originally developed in the context of nuclear physics.\nThe method of Grammaticos and Voros has the virture of preserving both the\nHermiticity and idempotency of the density matrix to all orders in the\n$\\hbar$-expansion. As a topical application, we use our semiclassical expansion\nto go beyond the local-density approximation for the construction of the total\ndipole-dipole interaction energy functional of a two-dimensional,\nspin-polarized dipolar Fermi gas. We find a {\\em finite}, second-order gradient\ncorrection to the Hartree-Fock energy, which takes the form $\\varepsilon\n(\\nabla \\rho)^2/\\sqrt{\\rho}$, with $\\varepsilon$ being small ($|\\varepsilon|\n\\ll1$) and negative. We test the quality of the corrected energy by comparing\nit with the exact results available for harmonic confinement. Even for small\nparticle numbers, the gradient correction to the dipole-dipole energy provides\na significant improvement over the local-density approximation.\n", "  Monte Carlo studies involving real time dynamics are severely restricted by\nthe sign problem that emerges from highly oscillatory phase of the path\nintegral. In this letter, we present a new method to compute real time\nquantities on the lattice using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism via Monte Carlo\nsimulations. The key idea is to deform the path integration domain to a complex\nmanifold where the phase oscillations are mild and the sign problem is\nmanageable. We use the previously introduced \"contraction algorithm\" to create\na Markov chain on this alternative manifold. We substantiate our approach by\nanalyzing the quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator. Our results are in\nagreement with the exact ones obtained by diagonalization of the Hamiltonian.\nThe method we introduce is generic and in principle applicable to quantum field\ntheory albeit very slow. We discuss some possible improvements that should\nspeed up the algorithm.\n", "  We sketch the basic ideas of the lattice regularization in Quantum Field\nTheory, the corresponding Monte Carlo simulations, and applications to Quantum\nChromodynamics (QCD). This approach enables the numerical measurement of\nobservables at the non-perturbative level. We comment on selected results, with\na focus on hadron masses and the link to Chiral Perturbation Theory. At last we\naddress two outstanding issues: topological freezing and the sign problem.\n", "  We report on the possibility of reweighting parton-shower Monte Carlo\npredictions for scale variations in the parton-shower algorithm. The method is\nbased on a generalization of the Sudakov veto algorithm. We demonstrate the\nfeasibility of this approach using example physical distributions.\nImplementations are available for both the parton-shower modules in the Herwig\n7 event generator.\n", "  We study a system of particles in two dimensions interacting via a dipolar\nlong-range potential $D/r^3$ and subject to a square-lattice substrate\npotential $V({\\bf r})$ with amplitude $V$ and lattice constant $b$. The\nisotropic interaction favors a hexagonal arrangement of the particles with\nlattice constant $a$, which competes against the square symmetry of the\nsubstrate lattice. We determine the minimal-energy states at fixed external\npressure $p$ generating the commensurate density $n = 1/b^2 = (4/3)^{1/2}/a^2$\nin the absence of thermal and quantum fluctuations, using both analytical and\nnumerical techniques. At large substrate amplitude $V > 0.2\\, e_D$, with $e_D =\nD/b^3$ the dipolar energy scale, the particles reside in the substrate minima\nand hence arrange in a square lattice. Upon decreasing $V$, the square lattice\nturns unstable with respect to a zone-boundary shear-mode and deforms into a\nperiod-doubled zig-zag lattice. Analytic and numerical results show that this\nperiod-doubled phase in turn becomes unstable at $V \\approx 0.074\\, e_D$\ntowards a non-uniform phase developing an array of domain walls or solitons; as\nthe density of solitons increases, the particle arrangement approaches that of\na rhombic (or isosceles triangular) lattice. At a yet smaller substrate value\nestimated as $V \\approx 0.046\\, e_D$, a further solitonic transition\nestablishes a second non-uniform phase which smoothly approaches the hexagonal\n(or equilateral triangular) lattice phase with vanishing amplitude $V$. At\nsmall but finite amplitude $V$, the hexagonal phase is distorted and\nhexatically locked at an angle of $\\varphi \\approx 3.8^\\circ$ with respect to\nthe substrate lattice. The square-to-hexagonal transformation in this\ntwo-dimensional commensurate-incommensurate system thus involves a complex\npathway with various non-trivial lattice- and modulated phases.\n", "  We study the cyclotron resonance in the electron-hole joint Fermi surface of\na type-II Weyl semimetal. In magnetic field, the electron and hole pockets\ntouching at the Weyl node are hybridized to form quantized Landau levels\ncorresponding to semiclassical 8-shaped orbits. We calculate the dynamical\nconductivities for the electric fields oscillating in $x$ and $y$-directions\nand find that the resonant frequencies in $x$ and $y$ differ by the factor of\ntwo, reflecting to the figure-of-eight electron motion in the real space. The\npeculiar anisotropy in the cyclotron resonance serves as a unique\ncharacteristic of the dumbbell-like Fermi surface.\n", "  We report the binding energy of $^{87}$Rb$^{133}$Cs molecules in their\nrovibrational ground state measured using an offset-free optical frequency comb\nbased on difference frequency generation technology. We create molecules in the\nabsolute ground state using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) with a\ntransfer efficiency of 88\\%. By measuring the absolute frequencies of our\nSTIRAP lasers, we find the energy-level difference from an initial weakly-bound\nFeshbach state to the rovibrational ground state with a resolution of 5 kHz\nover an energy-level difference of more than 114 THz; this lets us discern the\nhyperfine splitting of the ground state. Combined with theoretical models of\nthe Feshbach state binding energies and ground-state hyperfine structure, we\ndetermine a zero-field binding energy of $h\\times114\\,268\\,135\\,237(5)(50)$\nkHz. To our knowledge, this is the most accurate determination to date of the\ndissociation energy of a molecule.\n", "  For magnetic materials containing many lattice imperfections (e.g.,\nnanocrystalline magnets), the relativistic Dzyaloshinski-Moriya (DM)\ninteraction may result in nonuniform spin textures due to the lack of inversion\nsymmetry at interfaces. Within the framework of the continuum theory of\nmicromagnetics, we explore the impact of the DM interaction on the elastic\nmagnetic small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) cross section of bulk\nferromagnets. It is shown that the DM interaction gives rise to a\npolarization-dependent asymmetric term in the spin-flip SANS cross section.\nAnalysis of this feature may provide a means to determine the DM constant.\n", "  AGN driven outflows are invoked in numerical simulations to reproduce several\nobserved properties of local galaxies. The z > 1 epoch is of particular\ninterest as it was during this time that the volume averaged star formation and\nthe accretion rate of black holes were maximum. Radiatively driven outflows are\ntherefore believed to be common during this epoch. We aim to trace and\ncharacterize outflows in AGN hosts with high mass accretion rates at z > 1\nusing integral field spectroscopy. We obtain spatially-resolved kinematics of\nthe [OIII]5007 line in two targets which reveal the morphology and spatial\nextension of the outflows. We present J and H+K band SINFONI observations of 5\nAGNs at 1.2 < z < 2.2. To maximize the chance of observing radiatively driven\noutflows, our sample was pre-selected based on peculiar values of the Eddington\nratio and the hydrogen column density of the surrounding interstellar medium.\nWe observe high velocity (~600-1900 km/s) and kiloparsec scale extended ionized\noutflows in at least 3 of our targets, using [OIII]5007 line kinematics tracing\nthe AGN narrow line region. We estimate the total mass of the outflow, the mass\noutflow rate, and the kinetic power of the outflows based on theoretical models\nand report on the uncertainties associated with them. We find mass outflow\nrates of ~1-10 M_sun/yr for the sample presented in this paper. Based on the\nhigh star formation rates of the host galaxies, the observed outflow kinetic\npower and the expected power due to the AGN, we infer that both star formation\nand AGN radiation could be the dominant source for the outflows. The outflow\nmodels suffer from large uncertainties, hence we call for further detailed\nobservations for an accurate determination of the outflow properties to confirm\nthe exact source of these outflows.\n", "  We present the quantum theory of coherent Ising machines based on networks of\ndegenerate optical parametric oscillators (DOPOs).\n  In a simple model consisting of two coupled DOPOs, both positive-$P$\nrepresentation and truncated Wigner representation predict quantum correlation\nand inseparability between the two DOPOs in spite of the open-dissipative\nnature of the system.\n  Here, we apply the truncated Wigner representation method to coherent Ising\nmachines with thermal, vacuum, and squeezed reservoir fields. We find that the\nprobability of finding the ground state of a one-dimensional Ising model\nincreases substantially as a result of reducing excess thermal noise and\nsqueezing the incident vacuum fluctuation on the out-coupling port.\n", "  Motivated by a recent paper by Rychkov-Tan \\cite{Rychkov:2015naa}, we\ncalculate the anomalous dimensions of the composite operators at the leading\norder in various models including a $\\phi^3$-theory in $(6-\\epsilon)$\ndimensions. The method presented here relies only on the classical equation of\nmotion and the conformal symmetry. In case that only the leading expressions of\nthe critical exponents are of interest, it is sufficient to reduce the\nmultiplet recombination discussed in \\cite{Rychkov:2015naa} to the classical\nequation of motion. We claim that in many cases the use of the classical\nequations of motion and the CFT constraint on two- and three-point functions\ncompletely determine the leading behavior of the anomalous dimensions at the\nWilson-Fisher fixed point without any input of the Feynman diagrammatic\ncalculation. The method developed here is closely related to the one presented\nin \\cite{Rychkov:2015naa} but based on a more perturbative point of view.\n", "  Here we show that the Coulomb interaction between violations of the\nBernal-Fowler rules leads to a temperature induced step-wise increase in their\nconcentration by 6-7 orders of magnitude. This first-order phase transition is\naccompanied by commensurable decrease in the relaxation time and can be\ninterpreted as melting of the hydrogen bond network. The new phase with the\nmelted hydrogen lattice and survived oxygen one is unstable in the bulk of ice,\nand further drastic increase in the concentrations of oxygen interstitials and\nvacancies accomplishes the ice melting. The fraction of broken hydrogen bonds\nimmediately after the melting is about 0.07 of their total number that implies\nan essential conservation of oxygen lattice in water.\n", "  We study the vortex lattice in a two-dimensional s-wave topological\nsuperconductor with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman field by solving the\nBogoliubov-de Gennes equations self-consistently for the superconducting order\nparameter. We find that when spin-orbit coupling is relatively weak, one of the\ntwo underlying chiralities in the topological superconducting state can be\nstrongly manifest in the vortex core structure and govern the response of the\nsystem to vorticity and a nonmagnetic impurity where the vortex is pinned. The\nMajorana zero mode in the vortex core is found to be robust against the\nnonmagnetic impurity in that it remains effectively a zero-energy bound state\nregardless of the impurity potential strength and the major chirality. The spin\npolarization of the Majorana bound state depends on the major chirality for\nweak spin-orbit coupling, while it is determined simply by the vorticity when\nspin-orbit coupling is relatively strong.\n", "  We discuss a novel technique of manipulating X-ray images of galaxy clusters\nto reveal the nature of small-scale density/temperature perturbations in the\nintra cluster medium (ICM). As we show, this technique can be used to\ndifferentiate between sound waves and isobaric perturbations in Chandra images\nof the Perseus and M87/Virgo clusters. The comparison of the manipulated images\nwith the radio data and with the results of detailed spectral analysis shows\nthat this approach successfully classifies the types of perturbations and helps\nto reveal their nature. For the central regions (5-100 kpc) of the M87 and\nPerseus clusters this analysis suggests that observed images are dominated by\nisobaric perturbations, followed by perturbations caused by bubbles of\nrelativistic plasma and weak shocks. Such a hierarchy is best explained in a\n\"slow\" AGN feedback scenario, when much of the mechanical energy output of a\ncentral black hole is captured by the bubble enthalpy that is gradually\nreleased during buoyant rise of the bubbles. The \"image arithmetic\" works best\nfor prominent structure and for datasets with excellent statistics, visualizing\nthe perturbations with a given effective equation of state. The same approach\ncan be extended to faint perturbations via cross-spectrum analysis of surface\nbrightness fluctuations in X-ray images in different energy bands.\n", "  We demonstrate a new scheme of spectromicroscopy in the extreme ultraviolet\n(EUV) spectral range, where the spectral response of the sample at different\nwavelengths is imaged simultaneously. It is enabled by applying ptychographical\ninformation multiplexing (PIM) to a tabletop EUV source based on high harmonic\ngeneration, where four spectrally narrow harmonics near 30 nm form a spectral\ncomb structure. Extending PIM from previously demonstrated visible wavelengths\nto the EUV/X-ray wavelengths promises much higher spatial resolution and more\npowerful spectral contrast mechanism, making PIM an attractive\nspectromicroscopy method in both the microscopy and the spectroscopy aspects.\nBesides the sample, the multicolor EUV beam is also imaged in situ, making our\nmethod a powerful beam characterization technique. No hardware is used to\nseparate or narrow down the wavelengths, leading to efficient use of the EUV\nradiation.\n", "  We report the discovery of $\\Xi_{c}(3055)^{0}$, observed by its decay into\nthe final state $\\Lambda D^{0}$, and present the first observation and evidence\nof the decays of $\\Xi_c(3055)^{+}$ and $\\Xi_c(3080)^{+}$ into $\\Lambda D^{+}$.\nWe also perform a combined analysis of the $\\Lambda D^{+}$ with the\n$\\Sigma_{c}^{++}K^{-}$ and $\\Sigma_{c}^{\\ast ++}K^{-}$ decay modes to measure\nthe ratios of branching fractions, masses and widths with improved accuracy. We\nmeasure the ratios of branching fractions ${\\cal B}(\\Xi_{c}(3055)^{+} \\to\n\\Lambda D^{+})/{\\cal B}(\\Xi_{c}(3055)^{+} \\to\n\\Sigma_{c}^{++}K^{-})=5.09\\pm1.01\\pm0.76$, ${\\cal B}(\\Xi_{c}(3080)^{+} \\to\n\\Lambda D^{+})/{\\cal B}(\\Xi_{c}(3080)^{+} \\to\n\\Sigma_{c}^{++}K^{-})=1.29\\pm0.30\\pm0.15$, and ${\\cal B}(\\Xi_{c}(3080)^{+} \\to\n\\Sigma_{c}^{\\ast ++}K^{-})/{\\cal B}(\\Xi_{c}(3080)^{+} \\to\n\\Sigma_{c}^{++}K^{-})=1.07\\pm0.27\\pm0.01$, where the uncertainties are\nstatistical and systematic. The analysis is performed using a 980 fb$^{-1}$\ndata sample collected with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy\n$e^{+}e^{-}$ collider.\n", "  We carry out Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations to study the instabilities\nassociated with a 2-D sheared electron flow configuration against a\nneutralizing background of ions. Both weak and strong relativistic flow\nvelocities are considered. In the weakly relativistic case, we observe the\ndevelopment of electromagnetic Kelvin Helmholtz instability with similar\ncharacteristics as that predicted by the electron Magnetohydrodynamic (EMHD)\nmodel. On other hand, in strong relativistic case the compressibility effects\nof electron fluid dominate and introduce upper hybrid electrostatic\noscillations transverse to the flow which are very distinct from EMHD fluid\nbehaviour. In the nonlinear regime, both weak and strong relativistic cases\nlead to turbulence with broad power law spectrum.\n", "  We analyze the energy spectrum of graphene in the presence of spin-orbit\ncoupling and a unidirectionally periodic Zeeman field, focusing on the\nstability and location of Dirac points it may support. It is found that the\nDirac points at the $K$ and $K'$ points are generically moved to other\nlocations in the Brillouin zone, but that they remain present when the Zeeman\nfield $\\vec{\\Delta}(x)$ integrates to zero within a unit cell. A large variety\nof locations for the Dirac points is shown to be possible: when $\\vec\\Delta\n\\parallel \\hat{z}$ they are shifted from their original locations along the\ndirection perpendicular to the superlattice axis, while realizations of\n$\\vec\\Delta(x)$ that rotate periodically move the Dirac points to locations\nthat can reflect the orbit of the rotating electron spin as it moves through a\nunit cell. When a uniform Zeeman field is applied in addition to a periodic\n$\\vec\\Delta \\parallel \\hat{z}$ integrating to zero, the system can be brought\ninto a metallic, Dirac semimetal, or insulating state, depending on the\ndirection of the uniform field. The latter is shown to be an anomalous quantum\nHall insulator.\n", "  We report a quantum measurement beyond the standard quantum limit (SQL) for\nthe amplitude of a small displacement acting on a cavity field. This\nmeasurement uses as resource an entangled mesoscopic state, prepared by the\nresonant interaction of a circular Rydberg atom with a field stored in a\nsuperconducting cavity. We analyse the measurement process in terms of Fisher\ninformation and prove that it is, in principle, optimal. The achieved\nexperimental precision, 2.4 dB below the SQL, is well understood in terms of\nexperimental imperfections.This method could be transposed to other systems,\nparticularly to circuit QED, for the precise measurements of weak forces acting\non oscillators.\n", "  We consider thermodynamics of the van der Waals fluid of quantum systems. We\nderive general relations of thermodynamic functions and parameters of any ideal\ngas and the corresponding van der Waals fluid. This provides unambiguous\ngeneralization of the classical van der Waals theory to quantum statistical\nsystems. As an example, we apply the van der Waals fluid with fermi statistics\nto characterize the liquid-gas critical point in nuclear matter. We also\nintroduce the Bose-Einstein condensation in the relativistic van der Waals\nboson gas, and argue, that it exhibits two-phase structure separated in space.\n", "  The calculation of potential energy surfaces for quantum dynamics can be a\ntime consuming task -- especially when a high level of theory for the\nelectronic structure calculation is required. We propose an adaptive\ninterpolation algorithm based on polyharmonic splines combined with a partition\nof unity approach. The adaptive node refinement allows to greatly reduce the\nnumber of sample points by employing a local error estimate. The algorithm and\nits scaling behavior is evaluated for a model function in 2, 3 and 4\ndimensions. The developed algorithm allows for a more rapid and reliable\ninterpolation of a potential energy surface within a given accuracy compared to\nthe non-adaptive version.\n", "  The ability to control propagation of electromagnetic guided modes lies at\nthe heart of integrated nanophotonics. Surface plasmon-polaritons are a class\nof guided modes which can be employed in integrated optical systems. Here, we\npresent a theoretical design of a coherent surface plasmon absorber which can\nperfectly harvest energy of coherently incident surface plasmons without\nparasitic scattering into free space modes. Excitation of free space modes\nwhich usually accompanies scattering of a surface plasmon by an interface\nboundary is avoided due to specially tailored anisotropy of the absorber. The\nconcept of coherent SPP absorber is analyzed numerically for spatially\nnon-uniform and finite-size structures. We believe that our results will be\nimportant for the development of integrated nanoplasmonic systems.\n", "  We describe the structural and electronic properties of graphene doped with\nsubstitutional impurities of 4d and 5d transition metals. The binding energy\nand distances for 4d and 5d metals in graphene show similar trends for the\nlater groups in the periodic table, which is also well-known characteristic of\n3d elements. However, along earlier groups the 4d impurities in graphene show\nvery similar binding energies, distances and magnetic moments to 5d ones, which\ncan be related to the influence of the 4d and 5d lanthanide contraction.\nSurprisingly, within the manganese group, the total magnetic moment of\n3$\\mu_{B}$ for manganese is reduced to 1$\\mu_{B}$ for technetium and rhenium.\nWe find that with compared with 3d elements, the larger size of the 4d and 5d\nelements causes a high degree hybridization with the neighbouring carbon atoms,\nreducing spin splitting in the d levels. It seems that the magnetic adjustment\nof graphene could be significantly different is 4d or 5d impurities are used\ninstead of 3d impurities.\n", "  We study the low energy effective action of the $\\Omega$-deformed $\\mathcal N\n=2^{*}$ $SU(2) $ gauge theory. It depends on the deformation parameters\n$\\epsilon_{1},\\epsilon_{2}$, the scalar field expectation value $a$, and the\nhypermultiplet mass $m$. We explore the plane $(\\frac{m}{\\epsilon_{1}},\n\\frac{\\epsilon_{2}}{\\epsilon_{1}})$ looking for special features in the\nmulti-instanton contributions to the prepotential, motivated by what happens in\nthe Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit $\\epsilon_{2}\\to 0$. We propose a simple\ncondition on the structure of poles of the $k$-instanton prepotential and show\nthat it is admissible at a finite set of points in the above plane. At these\nspecial points, the prepotential has poles at fixed positions independent on\nthe instanton number. Besides and remarkably, both the instanton partition\nfunction and the full prepotential, including the perturbative contribution,\nmay be given in closed form as functions of the scalar expectation value $a$\nand the modular parameter $q$ appearing in special combinations of Eisenstein\nseries and Dedekind $\\eta$ function. As a byproduct, the modular anomaly\nequation can be tested at all orders at these points. We discuss these special\nfeatures from the point of view of the AGT correspondence and provide explicit\ntoroidal 1-blocks in non-trivial closed form. The full list of solutions with\n1, 2, 3, and 4 poles is determined and described in details.\n", "  We present a diode laser system optimized for laser cooling and atom\ninterferometry with ultra-cold rubidium atoms aboard sounding rockets as an\nimportant milestone towards space-borne quantum sensors. Design, assembly and\nqualification of the system, combing micro-integrated distributed feedback\n(DFB) diode laser modules and free space optical bench technology is presented\nin the context of the MAIUS (Matter-wave Interferometry in Microgravity)\nmission.\n  This laser system, with a volume of 21 liters and total mass of 27 kg, passed\nall qualification tests for operation on sounding rockets and is currently used\nin the integrated MAIUS flight system producing Bose-Einstein condensates and\nperforming atom interferometry based on Bragg diffraction. The MAIUS payload is\nbeing prepared for launch in fall 2016.\n  We further report on a reference laser system, comprising a rubidium\nstabilized DFB laser, which was operated successfully on the TEXUS 51 mission\nin April 2015. The system demonstrated a high level of technological maturity\nby remaining frequency stabilized throughout the mission including the rocket's\nboost phase.\n", "  Plasmonic Faraday rotation in nanowires manifests itself in the rotation of\nthe spatial intensity distribution of high-order surface plasmon polariton\n(SPP) modes around the nanowire axis. Here we predict theoretically the giant\nFaraday rotation for SPP propagating on graphene-coated magneto-optically\nactive nanowires. Upon the reversal of the external magnetic field pointing\nalong the nanowire axis some high-order plasmonic modes may be rotated by up to\n~ 100 degrees on scale of about 500 nm at mid-infrared frequencies. Tuning\ncarrier concentration in graphene by chemical doping or gate voltage allows for\ncontrolling SPP-properties and notably the rotation angle of high-order\nazimuthal modes. Our results open the door to novel plasmonic applications\nranging from nanowire-based Faraday isolators to the magnetic control in\nquantum-optical applications.\n", "  The study of quantum quenches in integrable systems has significantly\nadvanced with the introduction of the Quench Action method, a versatile\nanalytical approach to non-equilibrium dynamics. However, its application is\nlimited to those cases where the overlaps between the initial state and the\neigenstates of the Hamiltonian governing the time evolution are known exactly.\nConversely, in this work we consider physically interesting initial states for\nwhich such overlaps are still unknown. In particular, we focus on different\nclasses of product states in spin-$1/2$ and spin-$1$ integrable chains, such as\ntilted ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. We get around the missing overlaps by\nfollowing a recent approach based on the knowledge of complete sets of\nquasi-local charges. This allows us to provide a closed-form analytical\ncharacterization of the effective stationary state reached at long times after\nthe quench, through the Bethe ansatz distributions of particles and holes. We\ncompute the asymptotic value of local correlations and check our predictions\nagainst numerical data.\n", "  We construct the solution of type IIB supergravity describing the integrable\nlambda-deformation of the AdS_3 x S^3 supercoset. While the geometry\ncorresponding to the deformation of the bosonic coset has been found in the\npast, our background is more natural for studying superstrings, and several\ninteresting features distinguish our solution from its bosonic counterpart. We\nalso report progress towards constructing the lambda-deformation of the AdS_5 x\nS^5 supercoset.\n", "  Circulators based on spoof surface plasmon polaritons are designed and\nanalyzed. In the letter, we use blade structure to realize the propagation of\nSSPPs wave and a matching transition is used to feed energy from coplanar\nwaveguide to the SSPPs. And the circulator shows good nonreciprocal\ntransmission characteristics. The simulation results indicate that in the\nfrequency band from 5 to 6.6 GHz, the isolation degree and return loss\nbasically reaches 15dB and the insertion loss is less than 0.5dB. Moreover, the\nuse of confinement electromagnetic waves can decrease the size of the ferrite\nand show a broadband characteristic.\n", "  Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we investigated the\nadsorption of CO2 molecules on 3d transition metal (TM)-benzene complexes. Our\ncalculations show that the maximum number of CO2 molecules adsorbable on Sc or\nTi atoms is three, but the 18-electron rule predicts it should be four. The\n18-electron rule is generally successful in predicting the maximum H2\nadsorption number for TM atoms including Sc or Ti atoms. We found that the\n18-electron rule fails to correctly predict CO2 binding on Sc- or Ti-benzene\ncomplexes because CO2 binding, in contrast to H2 binding, requires additional\nconsideration for steric hindrance due to the large bond length of CO2. We\ncalculated the occupation function for CO2 using the Tolman cone angle, which\nshows that three CO2 molecules fully occupy the available space around Sc- and\nTi-benzene complexes. This estimation is the same maximum CO2 adsorption number\npredicted by DFT calculations. Therefore, we propose that the occupation\nfunction for CO2 using the Tolman cone angle is an efficient model for\nevaluating steric hindrance of CO2 adsorption on a surface.\n", "  Refining previous work by Iso, Kawai and Kitazawa, we discuss bi-local string\nstates as a tool for loop computations in noncommutative field theory and\nmatrix models. Defined in terms of coherent states, they exhibit the stringy\nfeatures of noncommutative field theory. This leads to a closed form for the\n1-loop effective action in position space, capturing the long-range non-local\nUV/IR mixing for scalar fields. The formalism applies to generic fuzzy spaces.\nThe non-locality is tamed in the maximally supersymmetric IKKT or IIB model,\nwhere it gives rise to supergravity. The linearized supergravity interactions\nare obtained directly in position space at one loop using string states on\ngeneric noncommutative branes.\n", "  We demonstrate that studies of the semiexclusive large angle photon - nucleus\nreactions: $\\gamma + A\\to h_1+h_2 +(A-1)^*$ with tagged photon beams of\nenergies $6 \\div 10$ GeV which can be performed in Hall D at Thomas Jefferson\nNational Acceleration Facility (TJNAF) would allow to probe several aspects of\nthe QCD dynamics: establish the $t$-range in which transition from soft to hard\ndynamics occurs, compare the strength of the interaction of various mesons and\nbaryons with nucleons at the energies of few GeV, as well as look for the color\ntransparency effects.\n", "  We present optical/near-infrared spectroscopy and photometry of the supernova\n(SN) PS15si. This object was originally identified as a Type IIn SN, but here\nwe argue that it should be reclassified as a Type Ia SN with narrow hydrogen\nlines originating from interaction with circumstellar matter (CSM; i.e., SN\nIa/IIn or SN Ia-CSM). Based on deep nondetections 27 days before discovery, we\ninfer that this SN was discovered around or slightly before optical maximum,\nand we estimate the approximate time that it reached R-band maximum based on\ncomparison with other SNe Ia/IIn. In terms of spectral morphology, we find that\nPS15si can be matched to a range of SN Ia spectral types, although SN\n1991T-like SNe Ia provides the most self-consistent match. While this\nobservation agrees with analysis of most other SNe Ia/IIn, we find that the\nimplied CSM luminosity is too low to account for the overall luminosity of the\nSN at a time when the CSM should outshine the underlying SN by a few\nmagnitudes. We infer that the similarity between PS15si and the hot,\noverluminous, high-ionisation spectrum of SN 1991T is a consequence of a\nspectrum that originates in ejecta layers that are heated by ultraviolet/X-ray\nradiation from CSM interaction. In addition, PS15si may have rebrightened over\na short timescale in the B and V bands around 85 days after discovery, perhaps\nindicating that the SN ejecta are interacting with a local enhancement in CSM\nproduced by clumps or a shell at large radii.\n", "  In this paper we consider a class of isospectral deformations of the\ninhomogeneous string boundary value problem. The deformations considered are\ngeneralizations of the isospectral deformation that has arisen in connection\nwith the Camassa-Holm equation for the shallow water waves. It is proved that\nthese new isospectral deformations result in evolution equations on the mass\ndensity whose form depends on how the string is tied at the endpoints.\nMoreover, it is shown that the evolution equations in this class linearize on\nthe spectral side and hence can be solved by the inverse spectral method. In\nparticular, the problem involving a mass density given by a discrete finite\nmeasure and arbitrary boundary conditions is shown to be solvable by Stieltjes'\ncontinued fractions.\n", "  We design and realise a hybrid interferometer consisting of three paths based\non integrated as well as on bulk optical components. This hybrid construction\noffers a good compromise between stability and footprint on one side and means\nof intervention on the other. As experimentally verified by the absence of\nhigher-order interferences, amplitude and phase can be manipulated in all paths\nindependently. In conjunction with single photons, the setup can, therefore, be\napplied for fundamental investigations on quantum mechanics.\n", "  The hot intra-cluster medium (ICM) is rich in metals, which are synthesized\nby supernovae (SNe) explosions and accumulate over time into the deep\ngravitational potential well of clusters of galaxies. Since most of the\nelements visible in X-rays are formed by type Ia (SNIa) and/or core-collapse\n(SNcc) supernovae, measuring their abundances gives us direct information on\nthe nucleosynthesis products of billions of SNe since the epoch of the star\nformation peak (z ~ 2-3). In this study, we use the EPIC and RGS instruments\nonboard XMM-Newton to measure the abundances of 9 elements (O, Ne, Mg, Si, S,\nAr, Ca, Fe and Ni) from a sample of 44 nearby cool-core galaxy clusters,\ngroups, and elliptical galaxies. We find that the Fe abundance shows a large\nscatter (~20-40%) over the sample, within 0.2$r_{500}$ and, especially,\n0.05$r_{500}$. Unlike the absolute Fe abundance, the abundance ratios (X/Fe)\nare quite uniform over the considered temperature range (~0.6-8 keV), and with\na limited scatter. In addition to a unprecedented treatment of systematic\nuncertainties, we provide the most accurate abundance ratios measured so far in\nthe ICM, including Cr/Fe and Mn/Fe that we firmly detect (>4{\\sigma} with MOS\nand pn independently). We find that Cr/Fe, Mn/Fe and Ni/Fe, differ\nsignificantly from the proto-solar values. However, the large uncertainties in\nthe proto-solar abundances prevent us from making a robust comparison between\nthe local and the intra-cluster chemical enrichments. We also note that,\ninterestingly, and despite the large net exposure time (~4.5 Ms) of our\ndataset, no line emission feature is seen around ~3.5 keV.\n", "  A set of global optical potential parameters, DA1p, for deuterons with the\n$1p$-shell nuclei is obtained by simultaneously fitting 67 sets of experimental\ndata of deuteron elastic scattering from \\nuc{6}{Li}, \\nuc{9}{Be}, \\nuc{10}{B},\n\\nuc{11}{B}, \\nuc{12}{C}, \\nuc{13}{C}, \\nuc{14}{N}, \\nuc{16}{O} and \\nuc{18}{O}\nwith incident energies between 5.25 and 170 MeV. DA1p improves the description\nof the deuteron elastic scattering from the $1p$-shell nuclei with respect to\nthe existing systematic deuteron potentials and can give satisfactory\nreproduction to the experimental data with radiative nuclei such as\n\\nuc{9}{Li}, \\nuc{10}{Be}, \\nuc{14}{C} and \\nuc{14}{O}.\n", "  We study Weyl symmetry (local conformal symmetry) in unimodular gravity. It\nis shown that the Noether currents for both Weyl symmetry and global scale\nsymmetry, identically vanish as in the conformally invariant scalar-tensor\ngravity. We clearly explain why in the class of conformally invariant\ngravitational theories, the Noether currents vanish by starting with the\nconformally invariant scalar-tensor gravity. Moreover, we comment on both\nclassical and quantum-mechanical equivalences among Einstein's general\nrelativity, the conformally invariant scalar-tensor gravity and the\nWeyl-transverse (WTDiff) gravity. Finally, we discuss the Weyl current in the\nconformally invariant scalar action and see that it is also vanishing.\n", "  We report on the increase in the spin reorientation temperature in\nHoFe0.5Cr0.5O3 compound by isovalent substitution Cr3+ at the Fe-site and the\nmagnetocapacitance in the HoFeO3 compound. Spin reorientation transition is\nevident around 50 K and 150 K for the x = 0 and x = 0.5 compounds respectively.\nThe increase in the spin reorientation transition temperature in case of x =\n0.5 compound can be attributed to the domination of the Ho3+ to Fe3+\ninteraction over the Fe3+ to Fe3+ interaction. Decrease in Neel temperature\nfrom 643 K (x = 0) to 273 K (x = 0.5) can be ascribed to the decrease in the\ninteraction between antiferromagnetically aligned Fe3+ moments as a result of\nthe dilution of the Fe3+ moments with the Cr3+ addition. From the magnetization\nM vs magnetic field H variation it is evident that the coercivity, HC decreases\nfor x = 0.5 compound, hinting the magnetic softening of the HoFeO3 compound.\nObserved magnetocapacitance could be due to lossy dielectric mechanism in the\npresent compound. Indeed, present results would be helpful in understanding the\nphysics behind rare- earth orthoferrites.\n", "  We consider harmonics generation and wave-mixing by two-color multi photon\nresonant excitation of three-level atoms/molecules in strong laser fields. The\ncoherent part of the spectra corresponding to multicolor harmonics generation\nis investigated. The obtained analytical results on the basis of generalized\nrotating wave approximation are in a good agreement with numerical\ncalculations. The results applied to the hydrogen atom and homonuclear diatomic\nmolecular ion show that one can achieve efficient generation of moderately high\nmulticolor harmonics via multiphoton resonant excitation by appropriate laser\npulses.\n", "  We study the rotor-router walk with the clockwise ordering of outgoing edges\non the semi-infinite cylinder. Imposing uniform conditions on the boundary of\nthe cylinder, we consider growth of the cluster of visited sites and its\ninternal structure. The average width of the surface region of the cluster\nevolves with time to the stationary value by a scaling law whose parameters are\nclose to the standard KPZ exponents. We introduce characteristic labels\ncorresponding to closed clockwise contours formed by rotors and show that the\nsequence of labels has in average an ordered helix structure.\n", "  In this paper, we present a new experimental facility, Little Earth\nExperiment, designed to study the hydrodynamics of liquid planetary cores. The\nmain novelty of this apparatus is that a transparent electrically conducting\nelectrolyte is subject to extremely high magnetic fields (up to 10T) to produce\nelectromagnetic effects comparable to those produced by moderate magnetic\nfields in planetary cores. This technique makes it possible to visualise for\nthe first time the coupling between the principal forces in a convection-driven\ndynamo by means of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in a geometry relevant to\nplanets. We first present the technology that enables us to generate these\nforces and implement PIV in a high magnetic field environment. We then show\nthat the magnetic field drastically changes the structure of convective plumes\nin a configuration relevant to the tangent cylinder region of the Earth's core.\n", "  The process $e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow\\gamma^{*}\\rightarrow \\pi^{0}\\gamma$ was\nconsidered using time-like pion transition form factor, obtained in the\napproach of the Anomaly Sum Rules(ASR). The total cross section and angular\ndistribution of the process was calculated. As the result of the comparison\nwith the data it was shown that ASR approach provides their good description in\nthe regions far from the pole. Also there was proposed a method allowing to\ngive reasonable description of data in the region of pole within the ASR\napproach. The strong restrictions for the parameters of the modified ASR\napproach were obtained.\n", "  Previous studies of the Carina region have revealed its complexity and\nrichness as well as a significant number of early-type stars. In many cases,\nthese studies only concentrated on the central region or were not homogeneous.\nThis latter aspect, in particular, is crucial because very different ages and\ndistances for key clusters have been claimed in recent years. The aim of this\nwork is to study in detail an area of the Galactic plane in Carina. We analyze\nthe properties of different stellar populations and focus on a sample of open\nclusters and their population of YSOs and highly reddened early stars. We also\nstudied the stellar mass distribution in these clusters and the possible\nscenario of their formation. Finally, we outline the Galactic spiral structure\nin this direction. We obtained photometric data for six young open clusters\nlocated in Carina at l = 291, and their adjacent stellar fields, which we\ncomplemented with spectroscopic observations of a few selected targets. We also\nculled additional information from the literature. Our results provide more\nreliable estimates of distances, color excesses, masses, and ages of the\nstellar populations in this direction. We estimate the basic parameters of the\nstudied clusters and find that they identify two overdensities of young stellar\npopulations. We find evidence of PMS populations inside them, with an apparent\ncoeval stellar formation in the most conspicuous clusters. We also discuss\napparent age and distance gradients in the direction NW-SE. We study the mass\ndistributions of several clusters in the region. They consistently show a\ncanonical IMF slope. We discover and characterise an abnormally reddened\nmassive stellar population. Spectroscopic observations of ten stars of this\nlatter population show that all selected targets were massive OB stars. Their\nlocation is consistent with the position of the Car-Sag spiral arm.\n", "  We use the Legendre invariant formalism of geometrothermodynamics to\ninvestigate the geometric properties of the equilibrium space of a spherically\nsymmetric phantom black hole with electric charge and dilaton. We find that at\ncertain points of the equilibrium space, the thermodynamic curvature is\ncharacterized by the presence of singularities that are interpreted as phase\ntransitions. We also investigate the phase transition structure by using the\nstandard approach of black hole thermodynamics based upon the analysis of the\nheat capacity and response functions. We show compatibility between the two\napproaches. In addition, a new type of phase transition is found which is due\nto the presence of phantom energy and corresponds to a transition between black\nhole states with different stability properties.\n", "  We present a novel analytical method for calculating the spectral function\nand the density of states in speckle potentials, valid in the semiclassical\nregime. Our approach relies on stationary phase approximations, allowing us to\ndescribe the singular quantum corrections at low energies. We apply it to the\ncalculation of the spectral function and the density of states in one and\ntwo-dimensional speckle potentials. By connecting our results with those of\nprevious work valid in the high energy sector, we end up with a consistent\ndescription of the whole energy spectrum, in good agreement with numerical\nsimulations.\n", "  Transmission matrices (TMs) have become a powerful and widely used tool to\ndescribe and control wave propagation in complex media. In certain scenarios\nthe TM is partially uncontrollable, complicating its identification and use. In\nstandard optical wavefront shaping experiments, uncontrollable reflections or\nadditional sources may be the cause; in reverberating cavities, uncontrollable\nreflections off the walls have that effect. Here we employ phase retrieval\ntechniques to identify such a partially uncontrollable system's TM solely based\non random intensity-only reference measurements. We demonstrate the feasibility\nof our method by focusing both on a single target as well as on multiple\ntargets in a microwave cavity, using a phase-binary\nSpatial-Microwave-Modulator.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the level of hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) in the\nintra-cluster medium of simulated galaxy clusters, extracted from\nstate-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations performed with the\nSmoothed-Particle-Hydrodynamic code GADGET-3. These simulations include several\nphysical processes, among which stellar and AGN feedback, and have been\nperformed with an improved version of the code that allows for a better\ndescription of hydrodynamical instabilities and gas mixing processes.\nEvaluating the radial balance between the gravitational and hydrodynamical\nforces, via the gas accelerations generated, we effectively examine the level\nof HE in every object of the sample, its dependence on the radial distance from\nthe center and on the classification of the cluster in terms of either\ncool-coreness or dynamical state. We find an average deviation of 10-20% out to\nthe virial radius, with no evident distinction between cool-core and\nnon-cool-core clusters. Instead, we observe a clear separation between regular\nand disturbed systems, with a more significant deviation from HE for the\ndisturbed objects. The investigation of the bias between the hydrostatic\nestimate and the total gravitating mass indicates that, on average, this traces\nvery well the deviation from HE, even though individual cases show a more\ncomplex picture. Typically, in the radial ranges where mass bias and deviation\nfrom HE are substantially different, the gas is characterized by a significant\namount of random motions (>~30 per cent), relative to thermal ones. As a\ngeneral result, the HE-deviation and mass bias, at given interesting distance\nfrom the cluster center, are not very sensitive to the temperature\ninhomogeneities in the gas.\n", "  In this Letter we present a Fresnel lens fabricated on the end of an optical\nfiber. The lens is fabricated using nanoimprint lithography of a functional\nhigh refractive index material, which is suitable for mass production. The main\nadvantage of the presented Fresnel lens compared to a conventional fiber lens\nis its high refractive index (n=1.69), which enables efficient light focusing\neven inside other media such as water or adhesive. Measurement of the lens\nperformance in an immersion liquid (n=1.51) shows a near diffraction limited\nfocal spot of 810 nm in diameter at the 1/e2 intensity level for a wavelength\nof 660 nm. Applications of such fiber lenses include integrated optics, optical\ntrapping and fiber probes.\n", "  We study the formation of galactic outflows from supernova explosions (SNe)\nwith the moving-mesh code AREPO in a stratified column of gas with a surface\ndensity similar to the Milky Way disk at the solar circle. We compare different\nsimulation models for SNe placement and energy feedback, including cosmic rays\n(CR), and find that models that place SNe in dense gas and account for CR\ndiffusion are able to drive outflows with similar mass loading as obtained from\na random placement of SNe with no CRs. Despite this similarity, CR-driven\noutflows differ in several other key properties including their overall\nclumpiness and velocity. Moreover, the forces driving these outflows originate\nin different sources of pressure, with the CR diffusion model relying on\nnon-thermal pressure gradients to create an outflow driven by internal pressure\nand the random-placement model depending on kinetic pressure gradients to\npropel a ballistic outflow. CRs therefore appear to be non-negligible physics\nin the formation of outflows from the interstellar medium.\n", "  Coupled resonators are commonly used to achieve tailored spectral responses\nand allow novel functionalities in a broad range of applications, from optical\nmodulation and filtering in integrated photonic circuits to the study of\nnonlinear dynamics in arrays of resonators. The Temporal Coupled-Mode Theory\n(TCMT) provides a simple and general tool that is widely used to model these\ndevices and has proved to yield very good results in many different systems of\nlow-loss, weakly coupled resonators. Relying on TCMT to model coupled\nresonators might however be misleading in some circumstances due to the\nlumped-element nature of the model. In this article, we report an important\nlimitation of TCMT related to the prediction of dark states. Studying a coupled\nsystem composed of three microring resonators, we demonstrate that TCMT\npredicts the existence of a dark state that is in disagreement with\nexperimental observations and with the more general results obtained with the\nTransfer Matrix Method (TMM) and the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD)\nsimulations. We identify the limitation in the TCMT model to be related to the\nmechanism of excitation/decay of the supermodes and we propose a correction\nthat effectively reconciles the model with expected results. A comparison with\nTMM and FDTD allows to verify both steady-state and transient solutions of the\nmodified-TCMT model. The proposed correction is derived from general\nconsiderations, energy conservation and the non-resonant power circulating in\nthe system, therefore it provides good insight on how the TCMT model should be\nmodified to eventually account for the same limitation in a different\ncoupled-resonator design. Moreover, our discussion based on coupled microring\nresonators can be useful for other electromagnetic resonant systems due to the\ngenerality and far-reach of the TCMT formalism.\n", "  In supersymmetric models with radiatively-driven naturalness, higgsino-like\nelectroweak-inos (EW-inos) are expected to lie in a mass range 100--300 GeV,\nthe lighter the more natural. Such states can be pair-produced at high rates at\nILC where their masses are nearly equal to the value of the superpotential mu\nparameter while their mass splittings depend on the gaugino masses M_1 and M_2.\nThe gaugino masses in turn depend on trilinear soft terms---the A parameters,\nwhich are expected to lie in the multi-TeV range owing to the 125 GeV Higgs\nmass---via two-loop contributions to renormalization group running. We examine\nthe extent to which ILC is sensitive to large A-terms via precision EW-ino mass\nmeasurement. Extraction of gaugino masses at the percent level should allow for\ninteresting probes of large trilinear soft SUSY breaking terms under the\nassumption of unified gaugino masses.\n", "  The present work suggests that the isocurvature tension between axion and\nhigh energy inflationary scenarios may be avoided by considering a double field\ninflationary model involving the hidden Peccei-Quinn Higgs and the Standard\nModel one. Some terms in the lagrangian we propose explicitly violate the\nPeccei-Quinn symmetry but, at the present era, their effect is completely\nnegligible. The resulting mechanism allows a large value for the axion\nconstant, of the order $f_a\\sim M_p$, thus the axion isocurvature fluctuations\nare suppressed even when the scale of inflation $H_{inf}$ is very high, of the\norder of $H_{inf}\\sim M_{gut}$. This numerical value is typical in Higgs\ninflationary models. An analysis about topological defect formation in this\nscenario is also performed, and it is suggested that, under certain\nassumptions, their effect is not catastrophic from the cosmological point of\nview.\n", "  This paper introduces a one-port method for estimating model parameters of\nVNA calibration standards. The method involves measuring the standards through\nan asymmetrical passive network connected in direct mode and then in reverse\nmode, and using these measurements to compute the S-parameters of the network.\nThe free parameters of the calibration standards are estimated by minimizing a\nfigure of merit based on the expected equality of the S-parameters of the\nnetwork when used in direct and reverse modes. The capabilities of the method\nare demonstrated through simulations, and real measurements are used to\nestimate the actual offset delay of a 50-$\\mathbf{\\Omega}$ calibration load\nthat is assigned zero delay by the manufacturer. The estimated delay is $38.8$\nps with a $1\\sigma$ uncertainty of $2.1$ ps for this particular load. This\nresult is verified through measurements of a terminated airline. The\nmeasurements agree better with theoretical models of the airline when the\nreference plane is calibrated using the new estimate for the load delay.\n", "  We connect the configurational entropy of a liquid to the geometrical\nproperties of its local energy landscape, using a high-temperature expansion.\nIt is proposed that correlations between local structures arises from their\noverlap and, being geometrical in nature, can be usefully determined using the\ninherent structures of high temperature liquids. We show quantitatively how the\nhigh-temperature covariance of these local structural fluctuations arising from\ntheir geometrical overlap, combined with their energetic stability, control the\ndecrease of entropy with decreasing energy. We apply this formalism to a family\nof Favoured Local Structure (FLS) lattice models with two low symmetry FLS's\nwhich are found to either crystallize or form a glass on cooling. The\ncovariance, crystal energy and estimated freezing temperature are tested as\npossible predictors of glass-forming ability in the model system.\n", "  In this talk we consider some aspects of the Manohar-Wise extension of the SM\nwith a colour-octet electroweak-doublet scalar applied to 2HDM. We present\ntheoretical constraints on the parameters of this extension to both the SM and\nthe 2HDM and discuss related phenomenology at LHC.\n", "  In this paper we show that using frame-like gauge invariant formulation for\nthe massive bosonic and fermionic fields in three dimensions the free\nLagrangians for these fields can be rewritten in the explicitly gauge invariant\nform in terms of the appropriately chosen set of gauge invariant objects. This\nin turn opens the possibility to apply the Fradkin-Vasiliev formalism to the\ninvestigation of possible interactions of such fields.\n", "  We develop a model for predicting fine- and hyperfine intensities in the\ndirect photoionization of molecules based on the separability of electron and\nnuclear spin states from vibrational-electronic states. Using spherical tensor\nalgebra, we derive highly symmetrized forms of the squared photoionization\ndipole matrix elements from which which we derive the salient selection and\npropensity rules for fine- and hyperfine resolved photoionizing transitions.\nOur theoretical results are validated by the analysis of the fine-structure\nresolved photoelectron spectrum of O$_2$ (reported by H. Palm and F. Merkt,\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 81, 1385 (1998)) and are used for predicting hyperfine\npopulations of molecular ions produced by photoionization.\n", "  Resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) is a widely used technique\nfor studying molecular photoionization and producing molecular cations for\nspectroscopy and dynamics studies. Here, we present a model for describing\nhyperfine-structure effects in the REMPI process and for predicting hyperfine\npopulations in molecular ions produced by this method. This model is a\ngeneralization of our model for fine- and hyperfine- structure effects in\none-photon ionization of molecules presented in the preceding companion\narticle. This generalization is achieved by covering two main aspects: (1)\ntreatment of the neutral bound-bound transition including hyperfine structure\nthat makes up the first step of the REMPI process and (2) modification of our\nionization model to account for anisotropic populations resulting from this\nfirst excitation step. Our findings may be used for analyzing results from\nexperiments with molecular ions produced by REMPI and may serve as a\ntheoretical background for hyperfine-selective ionization experiments.\n", "  The habitable zone concept is important because it focuses the scientific\nsearch for extraterrestrial life and aids the planning of future telescopes.\nRecent work has shown that planets near the outer edge of the habitable zone\nmight not actually be able to stay warm and habitable if CO$_2$ outgassing\nrates are not large enough to maintain high CO$_2$ partial pressures against\nremoval by silicate weathering. In this paper I use simple equations for the\nclimate and CO$_2$ budget of a planet in the habitable zone that can capture\nthe qualitative behavior of the system. With these equations I derive an\nanalytical formula for an effective outer edge of the habitable zone, including\nlimitations imposed by the CO$_2$ outgassing rate. I then show that climate\ncycles between a Snowball state and a warm climate are only possible beyond\nthis limit if the weathering rate in the Snowball climate is smaller than the\nCO$_2$ outgassing rate (otherwise stable Snowball states result). I derive an\nanalytical solution for the climate cycles including a formula for their period\nin this limit. This work allows us to explore the qualitative effects of\nweathering processes on the effective outer edge of the habitable zone, which\nis important because weathering parameterizations are uncertain.\n", "  We use magnetic-field-dependent features in the photoluminescence of\nnegatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers to measure magnetic fields without\nthe use of microwaves. In particular, we present a magnetometer based on the\nlevel anti-crossing in the triplet ground state at 102.4 mT with a demonstrated\nnoise floor of 6 nT/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$, limited by the intensity noise of the\nlaser and the performance of the background-field power supply. The technique\npresented here can be useful in applications where the sensor is placed closed\nto conductive materials, e.g. magnetic induction tomography or magnetic field\nmapping, and in remote-sensing applications since principally no electrical\naccess is needed.\n", "  The equivalence of the noncommutative U(N) quantum field theories related by\nthe theta-exact Seiberg-Witten maps is in this letter proven to all orders in\nthe perturbation theory with respect to the coupling constant. We show that\nthis duality holds for Super Yang-Mills theories with N=0,1,2,4 supersymmetry.\nA direct check of this equivalence relation is performed by computing the\none-loop quantum corrections to the quadratic part of the effective action in\nthe noncommutative U(1) gauge theory with N=0,1,2,4 supersymmetry.\n", "  We show that switching in ferroelectric lead germanate and lead iron\ntantalate zirconate titanate (PZTFT) does not resemble the equilibrium domain\nstructure evolution of the Landau-Lifshitz-Kittel model but is instead highly\nnonequilibrium and similar, respectively, to the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability\nin liquids and the Helfrich-Hursault sliding instability in liquid crystals.\nThe resulting nano-domain structures in PZTFT are circular or parabolic and\ninvolving folding bifurcations. These may have an undesirable impact on\nferroelectric thin-film memoriesthat are also ferroelastic.\n", "  Angular dependence of photoemission time delay for the valence $np_{3/2}$ and\n$np_{1/2}$ subshells of Ar, Kr and Xe is studied in the dipole relativistic\nrandom phase approximation. Strong angular anisotropy of the time delay is\nreproduced near respective Cooper minima while the spin-orbit splitting affects\nthe time delay near threshold.\n", "  We analyze higher gauge theories in various dimensions using a supergeometric\nmethod based on a differential graded symplectic manifold, called a\nQP-manifold, which is closely related to the BRST-BV formalism in gauge\ntheories. Extensions of the Lie 2-algebra gauge structure are formulated within\nthe Lie n-algebra induced by the QP-structure. We find that in 5 and 6\ndimensions there are special extensions of the gauge algebra. In these cases, a\nrestriction of the gauge symmetry by imposing constraints on the auxiliary\ngauge fields leads to a covariantized theory. As an example we show that we can\nobtain an off-shell covariantized higher gauge theory in 5 dimensions, which is\nsimilar to the one proposed in [1] (arxiv:1206.5643).\n", "  A system of two or more quantum dots interacting with a dissipative plasmonic\nnanostructure is investigated in detail by using a cavity quantum\nelectrodynamics approach with a model Hamiltonian. We focus on determining and\nunderstanding system configurations that generate multiple bipartite quantum\nentanglements between the occupation states of the quantum dots. These\nconfigurations include allowing for the quantum dots to be asymmetrically\ncoupled to the plasmonic system. Analytical solution of a simplified limit for\nan arbitrary number of quantum dots and numerical simulations and optimization\nfor the two- and three-dot cases are used to develop guidelines for maximizing\nthe bipartite entanglements. For any number of quantum dots, we show that\nthrough simple starting states and parameter guidelines, one quantum dot can be\nmade to share a strong amount of bipartite entanglement with all other quantum\ndots in the system, while entangling all other pairs to a lesser degree.\n", "  We discuss the upper bound on the gluino mass in supersymmetric models with\nvector-like extra matters. In order to realize the observed Higgs mass of 125\nGeV, the gluino mass is bounded from above in supersymmetric models. With the\nexistence of the vector-like extra matters at around TeV, we show that such an\nupper bound on the gluino mass is significantly reduced compared to the case of\nminimal supersymmetric standard model. This is due to the fact that radiatively\ngenerated stop masses as well the stop trilinear coupling are enhanced in the\npresence of the vector-like multiplets. In a wide range of parameter space of\nthe model with extra matters, the gluino is required to be lighter than $\\sim\n3$ TeV, which is likely to be within the reach of forthcoming LHC experiment.\n", "  A search for the resonant production of high-mass photon pairs is presented.\nThe analysis is based on samples of proton-proton collision data collected by\nthe CMS experiment at center-of-mass energies of 8 and 13 TeV, corresponding to\nintegrated luminosities of 19.7 and 3.3 inverse femtobarns, respectively. The\nsearch focuses on spin-0 and spin-2 resonances with masses between 0.5 and 4\nTeV and with widths, relative to the mass, between 1.4E-4 and 5.6E-2. Limits\nare set on scalar resonances produced through gluon-gluon fusion, and on\nRandall-Sundrum gravitons. A modest excess of events compatible with a narrow\nresonance with a mass of about 750 GeV is observed. The local significance of\nthe excess is approximately 3.4 standard deviations. The significance is\nreduced to 1.6 standard deviations once the effect of searching under multiple\nsignal hypotheses is considered. More data are required to determine the origin\nof this excess.\n", "  We study the phenomenology of the light and heavy Higgs boson production and\ndecay in the context of a $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the Standard Model with an\nadditional $Z'$ boson at future $e^+e^-$ linear colliders with center-of-mass\nenergies of $\\sqrt{s}=500-3000\\hspace{0.8mm}GeV$ and integrated luminosities of\n${\\cal L}=500-2000\\hspace{0.8mm}fb^{-1}$. The study includes the processes\n$e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow (Z, Z') \\to Zh$ and $e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow (Z, Z') \\to\nZH$, considering both the resonant and non-resonant effects. We find that the\ntotal number of expected $Zh$ and $ZH$ events can reach 909,124 and 97,487,\nrespectively, which is a very optimistic scenario and thus it would be possible\nto perform precision measurements for both Higgs bosons $h$ and $H$, as well as\nfor the $Z'$ boson in future high-energy and high-luminosity $e^+e^-$ colliders\nexperiments. Our study complements other studies on the B-L model and on the\nHiggs-strahlung processes $e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow (Z, Z') \\to Zh$ and\n$e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow (Z, Z') \\to ZH$.\n", "  Assembly and stability of mitotic spindle is governed by the interplay of\nvarious intra-cellular forces, e.g. the forces generated by motor proteins by\nsliding overlapping anti-parallel microtubules (MTs) polymerized from the\nopposite centrosomes, the interaction of kinetochores with MTs, and the\ninteraction of MTs with the chromosomes arms. We study the mechanical behavior\nand stability of spindle assembly within the framework of a minimal model which\nincludes all these effects. For this model, we derive a closed--form analytical\nexpression for the force acting between the centrosomes as a function of their\nseparation distance and we show that an effective potential can be associated\nwith the interactions at play. We obtain the stability diagram of spindle\nformation in terms of parameters characterizing the strength of motor sliding,\nrepulsive forces generated by polymerizing MTs, and the forces arising out of\ninteraction of MTs with kinetochores. The stability diagram helps in\nquantifying the relative effects of the different interactions and elucidates\nthe role of motor proteins in formation and inhibition of spindle structures\nduring mitotic cell division. We also predict a regime of bistability for\ncertain parameter range, wherein the spindle structure can be stable for two\ndifferent finite separation distances between centrosomes. This occurrence of\nbistability also suggests mechanical versatility of such self-assembled spindle\nstructures.\n", "  Free-space optical communication with spatial modes of light has become\ntopical due to the possibility of dramatically increasing communication\nbandwidth via Mode Division Multiplexing (MDM). While both scalar and vector\nvortex modes have been used as transmission bases, it has been suggested that\nthe latter is more robust in turbulence. Using orbital angular momentum as an\nexample, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that the crosstalk due\nto turbulence is the same in the scalar and vector basis sets of such modes.\nThis work brings new insights about the behaviour of vector and scalar modes in\nturbulence, but more importantly it demonstrates that when considering optimal\nmodes for MDM, the choice should not necessarily be based on their vectorial\nnature.\n", "  We investigate the impact of the direct searches for SUSY at LHC Run I on the\nnaturalness of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM). For\nthis end, we first scan the vast parameter space of the NMSSM to get the region\nwhere the fine tuning measures $\\Delta_Z$ and $\\Delta_h$ at the electroweak\nscale are less than about 50, then we implement by simulations the constraints\nof the direct searches on the parameter points in the region. Our results\nindicate that although the direct search experiments are effective in excluding\nthe points, the parameter intervals for the region and also the minimum reaches\nof $\\Delta_Z$ and $\\Delta_h$ are scarcely changed by the constraints, which\nimplies that the fine tuning of the NMSSM does not get worse after LHC Run I.\nMoreover, based on the results we propose a natural NMSSM scenario where the\nlightest neutralino $\\tilde{\\chi}_1^0$ as the dark matter (DM) candidate is\nHiggsino-dominated. In this scenario, $\\Delta_Z$ and $\\Delta_h$ may be as low\nas 2 without conflicting with any experimental constraints, and intriguingly\n$\\tilde{\\chi}_1^0$ can easily reach the measured DM relic density due to its\nsignificant Singlino component. We exhibit the features of the scenario which\ndistinguish it from the other natural SUSY scenario, including the properties\nof its neutralino-chargino sector and scalar top quark sector. We emphasize\nthat the scenario can be tested either through searching for $3 l + E_T^{miss}$\nsignal at 14 TeV LHC or through future DM direct detection experiments.\n", "  To understand the generation of the Earth's and planetary magnetic fields, we\ninvestigate numerically the combined effect of precession and convection on the\ndynamo action in a spherical shell. The convection alone, the precession alone\nand the combined effect of convection and precession are studied at the low\nEkman number at which the precessing flow is already unstable. The key result\nis that although the precession or convection alone is not strong to support\nthe dynamo action the combined effect of precession and convection can support\nthe dynamo action because of the resonance of precessional and convective\ninstabilities. This result may interpret why the geodynamo maintains for such a\nlong history compared to the Martian dynamo.\n", "  Computational imaging modalities support a simplification of the active\narchitectures required in an imaging system and these approaches have been\nvalidated across the electromagnetic spectrum. Recent implementations have\nutilized pseudo-orthogonal radiation patterns to illuminate an object of\ninterest---notably, frequency-diverse metasurfaces have been exploited as fast\nand low-cost alternative to conventional coherent imaging systems. However,\naccurately measuring the complex-valued signals in the frequency domain can be\nburdensome, particularly for sub-centimeter wavelengths. Here, computational\nimaging is studied under the relaxed constraint of intensity-only measurements.\nA novel 3D imaging system is conceived based on 'phaseless' and compressed\nmeasurements, with benefits from recent advances in the field of phase\nretrieval. In this paper, the methodology associated with this novel principle\nis described, studied, and experimentally demonstrated in the microwave range.\nA comparison of the estimated images from both complex valued and phaseless\nmeasurements are presented, verifying the fidelity of phaseless computational\nimaging.\n", "  We investigate the scattering and absorption properties of anisotropic\nmetal-dielectric core-shell nanoparticles. It is revealed that the radially\nanisotropic dielectric layer can accelerate the evanescent decay of the\nlocalized resonant surface modes, leading to Q-factor and absorption rate\nenhancement. Moreover, the absorption cross section can be maximized to reach\nthe single resonance absorption limit. We further show that such artificial\nanisotropic cladding materials can be realized by isotropic layered structures,\nwhich may inspire many applications based on scattering and absorption of\nplasmonic nanoparticles.\n", "  We study the magnetic field dependence of the ground state of $S=1/2$\n$J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice by the DMRG method with the\nsine-square deformation. We obtain 8 different phases including plaquette\nvalence-bond crystal with a finite spin gap, transverse N$\\acute{\\rm e}$el,\ntransverse stripe, 1/2 magnetization plateau with up-up-up-down (uuud), and\nthree new phases we named Y-like, V-like, and $\\Psi$ phases around $J_2/J_1$\n=0.55-0.6 depending on the magnetic field. The phase transitions to uuud and\nY-like states from transverse N$\\acute{\\rm e}$el (at $J_2/J_1$ = 0.55) and\nstripe (at $J_2/J_1$ = 0.6) states are discontinuous, as in the case of\nspin-flop.\n", "  The Raman response in a superconductor is a powerful probe to investigate the\nsymmetry of the superconducting gap. Here we show that in a multiband\nsuperconductor it also offers the unique opportunity to establish if the\ndriving pairing interaction has an intraband or interband character. In the\nmodel with one hole and one electron band the full gauge-invariant Raman\nresponse, obtained by accounting for the fluctuations of both the density and\nsuperconducting phase degrees of freedom, is always dominated by the Leggett\nmode, regardless its nature. However, while in the case of intra-band dominated\npairing the Josephson-like phase fluctuations of the two condensates identify a\nwell-defined peak, as observed in MgB$_2$, for dominant interband pairing the\nLeggett resonance is pushed at twice the largest gap, resembling apparently a\npair-breaking peak. The latter case is in very good agreement with experimental\ndata in iron-based superconductors, suggesting that an interband pairing\nmechanism should be at play in these systems. These results have also\ninteresting implications for the non-linear optical response probed by means of\nintense THz fields.\n", "  We address the calculation of dynamical correlation functions for many\nfermion systems at zero temperature, using the auxiliary-field quantum Monte\nCarlo method. The two-dimensional Hubbard hamiltonian is used as a model\nsystem. Although most of the calculations performed here are for cases where\nthe sign problem is absent, the discussions are kept general for applications\nto physical problems when the sign problem does arise. We study the use of\ntwisted boundary conditions to improve the extrapolation of the results to the\nthermodynamic limit. A strategy is proposed to drastically reduce finite size\neffects relying on a minimization among the twist angles. This approach is\ndemonstrated by computing the charge gap at half-filling. We obtain accurate\nresults showing the scaling of the gap with the interaction strength $U$,\nconnecting to the scaling of the unrestricted Hartree-Fock method at small $U$\nand Bethe Ansatz exact result in one dimension at large $U$. A new algorithm is\nthen proposed to compute dynamical Green functions and correlation functions\nwhich explicitly varies the number of particles during the random walks in the\nmanifold of Slater determinants. In dilute systems, such as ultracold Fermi\ngases, this algorithm enables calculations with much more favorable complexity,\nwith computational cost proportional to basis size or the number of lattice\nsites.\n", "  We have found experimentally that the rise times of voltage pulses in NbN\nsuperconducting single photon detectors increase nonlinearly with increasing\ndetector length. We fabricated superconducting single photon detectors based on\nNbN thin films with a meander-like sensitive region of area from 2x2um2 to\n11x11um2. The effect is connected with the dependence of the detector\nresistance, which appears after photon absorption, on its kinetic inductance\nand hence on detector length. This conclusion is confirmed by our calculations\nin the framework of the two-temperature model.\n", "  We calculate the width of the Roper resonance at next-to-leading order in a\nsystematic expansion of baryon chiral perturbation theory with pions, nucleons,\nand the delta and Roper resonances as dynamical degrees of freedom. Three\nunknown low-energy constants contribute up to the given order. One of them can\nbe fixed by reproducing the empirical value for the width of the Roper decay\ninto a pion and a nucleon. Assuming that the remaining two couplings of the\nRoper interaction take values equal to those of the nucleon, the result for the\nwidth of the Roper decaying into a nucleon and two pions is consistent with the\nexperimental value.\n", "  Background: Octupole-deformed nuclei, such as that of $^{225}$Ra, are\nexpected to amplify observable atomic electric dipole moments (EDMs) that arise\nfrom time-reversal and parity-violating interactions in the nuclear medium. In\n2015, we reported the first \"proof-of-principle\" measurement of the $^{225}$Ra\natomic EDM. Purpose: This work reports on the first of several experimental\nupgrades to improve the statistical sensitivity of our $^{225}$Ra EDM\nmeasurements by orders of magnitude and evaluates systematic effects that\ncontribute to current and future levels of experimental sensitivity. Method:\nLaser-cooled and trapped $^{225}$Ra atoms are held between two high voltage\nelectrodes in an ultra high vacuum chamber at the center of a magnetically\nshielded environment. We observe Larmor precession in a uniform magnetic field\nusing nuclear-spin-dependent laser light scattering and look for a phase shift\nproportional to the applied electric field, which indicates the existence of an\nEDM. The main improvement to our measurement technique is an order of magnitude\nincrease in spin precession time, which is enabled by an improved vacuum system\nand a reduction in trap-induced heating. Results: We have measured the\n$^{225}$Ra atomic EDM to be less than $1.4\\times10^{-23}$ $e$ cm (95%\nconfidence upper limit), which is a factor of 36 improvement over our previous\nresult. Conclusions: Our evaluation of systematic effects shows that this\nmeasurement is completely limited by statistical uncertainty. Combining this\nmeasurement technique with planned experimental upgrades we project a\nstatistical sensitivity at the $1\\times10^{-28}$ $e$ cm level and a total\nsystematic uncertainty at the $4\\times10^{-29}$ $e$ cm level.\n", "  Motivated by recent proposals of possible wormhole existence in galactic\nhalos, we analyse the cosmological evolution of wormhole solutions in modified\n$f(R)$ gravity. We construct a dynamical wormhole that asymptotically\napproaches FLRW universe, with supporting material going to the perfect\nisotropic fluid described by the equation of state for radiation and matter\ndominated universe respectively. Our analysis is based on an approximation of a\nsmall wormhole - a wormhole that can be treated as matched with the FLRW metric\nat some radial coordinate much smaller than the Hubble radius, so that\ncosmological boundary conditions are satisfied. With a special interest in\nviable wormhole solutions, we refer to the results of reconstruction procedure\nand use $f(R)$ functions which lead to the experimentally confirmed\n$\\Lambda$CDM expansion history of the Universe. Solutions we find imply no need\nfor exotic matter near the throat of considered wormholes, while in the limit\nof $f(R)=R$ this need is always present during radiation and matter dominated\nepoch.\n", "  We outline a basic strategy of how self-propulsion can be used to improve the\nyield of a typical colloidal self-assembly process. The success of this\napproach is predicated on the thoughtful design of the colloidal building block\nas well as how self-propulsion is endowed to the particle. As long as a set of\ncriteria are satisfied, it is possible to significantly increase the rate of\nself-assembly, and greatly expand the window in parameter space where\nself-assembly can occur. In addition, we show that by tuning the relative\non/off time of the self-propelling force it is possible to modulate the\neffective speed of the colloids allowing for further optimization of the\nself-assembly process.\n", "  In this paper, a kind of helix-like chiral metamaterial, which can be\nrealized with multiple conventional lithography or electron beam lithographic\ntechniques, is proposed to achieve broadband bianisotropic optical response\nanalogous to helical metamaterial. On the basis of twisted metamaterial, via\ntailoring the relative orientation within the lattice, the anisotropy of arc is\nconverted into magneto-electric coupling of closely spaced arc pairs, which\nleads to a broad bianisotropic optical response. By connecting the adjacent\nupper and lower arcs, the coupling of metasurface pairs is transformed to the\ncoupling of the three-dimensional inclusions, and provides a much broader and\nhigher bianisotropic optical response. For only a four-layer helix-like\nmetamaterial, the maximum extinction ratio can reach 19.7. The operation band\nis in the wavelength range from 4.69 {\\mu}m to 8.98 {\\mu}m with an average\nextinction ratio of 6.9. And the transmittance for selective polarization is\nabove 0.8 in the entire operation band. Such a structure is promising for\nintegratable and scalable broadband circular polarizers, especially has great\npotential to act as broadband circular micropolarizers in the field of the\nfull-stokes division of focal plane polarimeters.\n", "  The plasma equilibrium in a linear trap at $\\beta\\approx 1$ (or above the\nmirror-instability threshold) under the topology-conservation constraint\nevolves into a kind of diamagnetic \"bubble\". This can take two forms: either\nthe plasma body greatly expands in radius while containing the same magnetic\nflux, or, if the plasma radius is limited, the plasma distribution across\nflux-tubes changes, so that the same cross-section contains a greatly reduced\nflux. If the magnetic field of the trap is quasi-uniform around its minimum,\nthe bubble can be made roughly cylindrical, with radius much larger than the\nradius of the corresponding vacuum flux-tube, and with non-paraxial ends. Then\nthe effective mirror ratio of the diamagnetic trap becomes very large, but the\ncross-field transport increases. The confinement time can be found from\nsolution of the system of equilibrium and transport equations and is shown to\nbe $\\tau_E\\approx\\sqrt{\\tau_\\parallel\\tau_\\perp}$. If the cross-field\nconfinement is not too degraded by turbulence, this estimate in principle\nallows construction of relatively compact fusion reactors with lengths in the\nrange of a few tens of meters. In many ways the described here diamagnetic\nconfinement and the corresponding reactor parameters are similar to those\nclaimed by the FRCs.\n", "  We studied the spin dynamics of a Cr atom incorporated in a II-VI\nsemiconductor quantum dot using photon correlation techniques. We used recently\ndeveloped singly Cr-doped CdTe/ZnTe quantum dots (A. Lafuente-Sampietro {\\it et\nal.}, [1]) to access the spin of an individual magnetic atom. Auto-correlation\nof the photons emitted by the quantum dot under continuous wave optical\nexcitation reveals fluctuations of the localized spin with a timescale in the\n10 ns range. Cross-correlation gives quantitative transfer time between Cr spin\nstates. A calculation of the time dependence of the spin levels population in\nCr-doped quantum dots shows that the observed spin dynamics is controlled by\nthe exciton-Cr interaction. These measurements also provide a lower bound in\nthe 20 ns range for the intrinsic Cr spin relaxation time.\n", "  We study the formation and evolution of topological defects in an aligned\naxion model with multiple Peccei-Quinn scalars, where the QCD axion is realized\nby a certain combination of the axions with decay constants much smaller than\nthe conventional Peccei-Quinn breaking scale. When the underlying U(1)\nsymmetries are spontaneously broken, the aligned structure in the axion field\nspace exhibits itself as a complicated string-wall network in the real space.\nWe find that the string-wall network likely survives until the QCD phase\ntransition if the number of the Peccei-Quinn scalars is greater than two. The\nstring-wall system collapses during the QCD phase transition, producing a\nsignificant amount of gravitational waves in the nano-Hz range at present. The\ntypical decay constant is constrained to be below O(100) TeV by the pulsar\ntiming observations, and the constraint will be improved by a factor of 2 in\nthe future SKA observations.\n", "  Inside the H$_{2}$O snowline of protoplanetary disks, water evaporates from\nthe dust-grain surface into the gas phase, whereas it is frozen out on to the\ndust in the cold region beyond the snowline. H$_{2}$O ice enhances the solid\nmaterial in the cold outer part of a disk, which promotes the formation of\ngas-giant planet cores. We can regard the H$_{2}$O snowline as the surface that\ndivides the regions between rocky and gaseous giant planet formation. Thus\nobservationally measuring the location of the H$_{2}$O snowline is crucial for\nunderstanding the planetesimal and planet formation processes, and the origin\nof water on Earth. In this paper, we find candidate water lines to locate the\nH$_{2}$O snowline through future high-dispersion spectroscopic observations.\nFirst, we calculate the chemical composition of the disk and investigate the\nabundance distributions of H$_{2}$O gas and ice, and the position of the\nH$_{2}$O snowline. We confirm that the abundance of H$_{2}$O gas is high not\nonly in the hot midplane region inside the H$_{2}$O snowline but also in the\nhot surface layer of the outer disk. Second, we calculate the H$_{2}$O line\nprofiles and identify those H$_{2}$O lines which are promising for locating the\nH$_{2}$O snowline: the identified lines are those which have small Einstein $A$\ncoefficients and high upper state energies. The wavelengths of the candidate\nH$_{2}$O lines range from mid-infrared to sub-millimeter, and they overlap with\nthe regions accessible to ALMA and future mid-infrared high dispersion\nspectrographs (e.g., TMT/MICHI, SPICA).\n", "  In this paper we describe 4-dimensional gravity coupled to scalar and Maxwell\nfields by the Einstein-Katz action, that is, the covariant version of the\n\"Gamma-Gamma $-$ Gamma-Gamma\" part of the Hilbert action supplemented by the\ndivergence of a generalized \"Katz vector\". We consider static solutions of\nEinstein's equations, parametrized by some integration constants, which\ndescribe an ensemble of asymptotically AdS black holes. Instead of the usual\nDirichlet boundary conditions, which aim at singling out a specific solution\nwithin the ensemble, we impose that the variation of the action vanishes on\nshell for the broadest possible class of solutions. We will see that, when a\nlong-range scalar \"hair\" is present, only sub-families of the solutions can\nobey that criterion. The Katz-Bicak-Lynden-Bell (\"KBL\") superpotential built on\nthis (generalized) vector will then give straightforwardly the Noether charges\nassociated with the spacetime symmetries (that is, in the static case, the\nmass). Computing the action on shell, we will see next that the solutions which\nobey the imposed variational principle, and with Noether charges given by the\nKBL superpotential, satisfy the Gibbs relation, the Katz vectors playing the\nrole of \"counterterms\". Finally, we show on the specific example of dyonic\nblack holes that the sub-class selected by our variational principle satisfies\nthe first law of thermodynamics when their mass is defined by the KBL\nsuperpotential.\n", "  We demonstrate experimentally an efficient control of light intensity\ndistribution inside a random scattering system. The adaptive wavefront shaping\ntechnique is applied to a silicon waveguide containing scattering\nnanostructures, and the on-chip coupling scheme enables access to all input\nspatial modes. By selectively coupling the incident light to open or closed\nchannels of the disordered system, we not only vary the total energy stored\ninside the system by 7.4 times, but also change the energy density distribution\nfrom an exponential decay to a linear decay and to a profile peaked near the\ncenter. This work provides an on-chip platform for controlling light-matter\ninteractions in turbid media.\n", "  2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations are performed with high\nspatial resolution in order to distinguish between competing models of the\ncoronal heating problem. A single coronal loop powered by Alfv\\'{e}n waves\nexcited in the photosphere is the target of the present study. The coronal\nstructure is reproduced in our simulations as a natural consequence of the\ntransportation and dissipation of Alfv\\'{e}n waves. Further, the coronal\nstructure is maintained as the spatial resolution is changed from 25 to 3 km,\nalthough the temperature at the loop top increases with the spatial resolution.\nThe heating mechanisms change gradually across the magnetic canopy at a height\nof 4 Mm. Below the magnetic canopy, both the shock and the MHD turbulence are\ndominant heating processes. Above the magnetic canopy, the shock heating rate\nreduces to less than 10 % of the total heating rate while the MHD turbulence\nprovides significant energy to balance the radiative cooling and thermal\nconduction loss or gain. The importance of compressibility shown in the present\nstudy would significantly impact on the prospects of successful MHD turbulence\ntheory in the solar chromosphere.\n", "  It is still unclear how common the Sun is when compared to other similar\nstars in regards to some of its physical properties, such as rotation.\nConsidering that gyrochronology relations are widely used today to estimate\nages of stars in the main sequence, and that the Sun is used to calibrate it,\nit is crucial to assess if these procedures are acceptable. We analyze the\nrotational velocities -- limited by the unknown rotation axis inclination angle\n-- of an unprecedented large sample of solar twins in order to study the\nrotational evolution of Sun-like stars, and assess if the Sun is a typical\nrotator. We use high-resolution ($R = 115000$) spectra obtained with the HARPS\nspectrograph and ESO's 3.6 m telescope at La Silla Observatory. The projected\nrotational velocities for 82 solar twins are estimated by line profile fitting\nwith synthetic spectra. Macroturbulence velocities are inferred from a\nprescription that accurately reflects their dependence with effective\ntemperature and luminosity of the stars. Our sample of solar twins include some\nspectroscopic binaries with enhanced rotational velocities, and we do not find\nany non-spectroscopic binaries with unusually high rotation velocities. We\nverified that the Sun does not have a peculiar rotation, but the solar twins\nexhibit rotational velocities that depart from the Skumanich relation. The Sun\nis a regular rotator when compared to solar twins with a similar age.\nAdditionally, we obtain a rotational braking law that better describes the\nstars in our sample ($v \\propto t^{-0.6}$) in contrast to previous, often-used\nscalings.\n", "  An integrated photonic platform with anchored-membrane structures, the\nT-Guide, is proposed and numerically investigated. These compact air-clad\nstructures have high index contrast and are much more stable than prior\nmembrane-type structures. Their semi-infinite geometry enables single-mode and\nsingle-polarization (SMSP) operation over unprecedented bandwidths. Modal\nsimulations quantify this behavior, showing that an SMSP window of 2.75 octaves\n(1.2 - 8.1 {\\mu}m) is feasible for silicon T-Guides, spanning almost the entire\ntransparency range of silicon. Dispersion engineering for T-Guides yields broad\nregions of anomalous group velocity dispersion, rendering them a promising\nplatform for nonlinear applications, such as wideband frequency conversion.\n", "  Quantum molecular dynamics requires an accurate representation of the\nmolecular potential energy surface from a minimal number of electronic\nstructure calculations, particularly for nonadiabatic dynamics where excited\nstates are required. In this paper, we employ pseudospectral sampling of\ntime-dependent Gaussian basis functions for the simulation of non-adiabatic\ndynamics. Unlike other methods, the pseudospectral Gaussian molecular dynamics\ntests the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation with $N$ Dirac delta functions located at\nthe centers of the Gaussian functions reducing the scaling of potential energy\nevaluations from $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$. By projecting the\nGaussian basis onto discrete points in space, the method is capable of\nefficiently and quantitatively describing nonadiabatic population transfer and\nintra-surface quantum coherence. We investigate three model systems; the\nphotodissociation of three coupled Morse oscillators, the bound state dynamics\nof two coupled Morse oscillators, and a two-dimensional model for collinear\ntriatomic vibrational dynamics. In all cases, the pseudospectral Gaussian\nmethod is in quantitative agreement with numerically exact calculations. The\nresults are promising for nonadiabatic molecular dynamics in molecular systems\nwhere strongly correlated ground or excited states require expensive electronic\nstructure calculations.\n", "  This paper presents the first calculation of the gravitational self-force on\na small compact object on an eccentric equatorial orbit around a Kerr black\nhole to first order in the mass-ratio. That is the pointwise correction to the\nobject's equations of motion (both conservative and dissipative) due to its own\ngravitational field treated as a linear perturbation to the background Kerr\nspacetime generated by the much larger spinning black hole. The calculation\nbuilds on recent advances on constructing the local metric and self-force from\nsolutions of the Teukolsky equation, which led to the calculation of the\nDetweiler-Barack-Sago redshift invariant on eccentric equatorial orbits around\na Kerr black hole in a previous paper.\n  After deriving the necessary expression to obtain the self-force from the\nWeyl scalar $\\psi_4$, we perform several consistency checks of the method and\nnumerical implementation, including a check of the balance law relating orbital\naverage of the self-force to average flux of energy and angular momentum out of\nthe system. Particular attention is paid to the pointwise convergence\nproperties of the sum over frequency modes in our method, identifying a\nsystematic inherent loss of precision that any frequency domain calculation of\nthe self-force on eccentric orbits must overcome.\n", "  A standard approach to propulsion velocities of autophoretic colloids with\nthin interaction layers uses a reciprocity relation applied to the slip\nvelocity. But the surface flux (chemical, electrical, thermal, etc.), which is\nthe source of the field driving the slip is often more accessible. We show how,\nunder conditions of low Reynolds number and a field obeying the Laplace\nequation in the outer region, the slip velocity can be bypassed in velocity\ncalculations. In a sense, the actual slip velocity and a normal field\nproportional to the flux density are equivalent for this type of calculation.\nUsing known results for surface traction induced by rotating or translating an\ninert particle in a quiescent fluid, we derive simple and explicit integral\nformulas for translational and rotational velocities of arbitrary spheroidal\nand slender-body autophoretic colloids.\n", "  Fisher matrices play an important role in experimental design and in data\nanalysis. Their primary role is to make predictions for the inference of model\nparameters - both their errors and covariances. In this short review, I outline\na number of extensions to the simple Fisher matrix formalism, covering a number\nof recent developments in the field. These are: (a) situations where the data\n(in the form of (x,y) pairs) have errors in both x and y; (b) modifications to\nparameter inference in the presence of systematic errors, or through fixing the\nvalues of some model parameters; (c) Derivative Approximation for LIkelihoods\n(DALI) - higher-order expansions of the likelihood surface, going beyond the\nGaussian shape approximation; (d) extensions of the Fisher-like formalism, to\ntreat model selection problems with Bayesian evidence.\n", "  We investigate origin of three features that are often assumed in analysis of\ntwo-Higgs doublet models: (i) softly broken Z2 symmetry, (ii) CP invariant\nHiggs potential, and (iii) degenerated mass spectra. We extend electroweak\ngauge symmetry, introducing extra gauge symmetry and extra scalars, and we show\nthat our models effectively derive two-Higgs dou- blet models at low energy\nwhich naturally hold the three features. We also find that the models can solve\nthe strong CP problem.\n", "  For a number of non-interacting identical particles entering a multi-channel\nscatterer in various wave packet states, we construct a generating function for\nthe probabilities of various scattering outcomes. This is used to evaluate the\nmean numbers of particles $\\overline{n}_m$ scattered into a given ($m$-th)\nchannel, single-channel statistics, and inter-channel correlations. We show\nthat for initially uncorrelated particles, indistinguishability changes single\nchannel statistics without altering the the value of $\\overline{n}_m$. For\nuncorrelated bosons and fermions, bunching and anti-bunching behaviour can be\ndetected in the extreme-case probabilities, to have all particles scattered\ninto the same channel, or none of particles scattered into a channel, or\nchannels. As an example, we consider a cavity with a single long-lived\nresonance accessible to the particles, which allows them to \"pile up\" inside\nthe scatterer.\n", "  The main concepts of general relativistic thermodynamics and general\nrelativistic statistical mechanics are reviewed. The main building block of the\nproper relativistic extension of the classical thermodynamics laws is the\nfour-temperature vector \\beta, which plays a major role in the quantum\nframework and defines a very convenient hydrodynamic frame. The general\nrelativistic thermodynamic equilibrium condition demands \\beta to be a Killing\nvector field. We show that a remarkable consequence is that all Lie derivatives\nof all physical observables along the four-temperature flow must then vanish.\n", "  We have carried out $^{125}$Te nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in a wide\ntemperature range of 1.5 -- 300 K to investigate electronic properties of\nGe$_{50}$Te$_{50}$, Ag$_{2}$Ge$_{48}$Te$_{50}$ and Sb$_{2}$Ge$_{48}$Te$_{50}$\nfrom a microscopic point of view. From the temperature dependence of NMR shift\n($K$) and nuclear spin lattice relaxation rate (1/$T_1$), we found that two\nbands contribute to the physical properties of the materials. One band overlaps\nthe Fermi level providing the metallic state where no strong electron\ncorrelations are revealed by Korringa analysis. The other band is separated\nfrom the Fermi level by an energy gap of $E_{\\rm g}/k_{\\rm B}$ $\\sim$ 67 K,\nwhich gives rise to the semiconductor-like properties. First principle\ncalculation revealed that the metallic band originates from the Ge vacancy\nwhile the semiconductor-like band may be related to the fine structure of the\ndensity of states near the Fermi level. Low temperature $^{125}$Te NMR data for\nthe materials studied here clearly show that the Ag substitution increases hole\nconcentration while Sb substitution decreases it.\n", "  Deuteron-proton elastic scattering is studied in the multiple scattering\nexpansion formalism. The four contributions are taken into account:\none-nucleon-exchange, single- and double scattering, and $\\Delta$-isobar\nexcitation. The presented approach was applied to describe the differential\ncross sections at deuteron energies between 500 and 1300 MeV in a whole angular\nrange. The obtained results are compared with the experimental data.\n", "  The magnetic hyperfine (MHF) structure of the $5/2^+$(0.0 eV) ground state\nand the low-lying $3/2^+$(7.8 eV) isomeric state of the $^{229}$Th nucleus in\nhighly charged ions Th$^{89+}$ and Th$^{87+}$ is calculated. The distribution\nof the nuclear magnetization (the Bohr-Weisskopf effect) is accounted for in\nthe framework of the collective nuclear model with the wave functions of the\nNilsson model for the unpaired neutron. The deviations of the MHF structure for\nthe ground and isomeric states from their values in the model of point-like\nnuclear magnetic dipole are calculated. The influence of the mixing of the\nstates with the same quantum number $F$ on the energy of sublevels is studied.\nTaking into account the mixing of states, the probabilities of the transitions\nbetween the components of MHF structure are found.\n", "  Calcium Aluminium Inclusions (CAIs) formed in the Solar System, some 4,567\nmillion years ago. CAIs are almost always surrounded by Wark-Lovering Rims\n(WLRs), which are a sequence of thin, mono/bi-mineralic layers of refractory\nminerals, with a total thickness in the range of 1 to 100 microns. Recently,\nsome CAIs have been found that have tektite-like bowl-shapes. To form such\nshapes, the CAI must have travelled through a rarefied gas at hypersonic\nspeeds. We show how CAIs may have been ejected from the inner solar accretion\ndisc via the centrifugal interaction between the solar magnetosphere and the\ninner disc rim. They subsequently punched through the hot, inner disc rim wall\nat hypersonic speeds. This re-entry heating partially or completely evaporated\nthe CAIs. Such evaporation could have significantly increased the metal\nabundances of the inner disc rim. High speed movement through the inner disc\nproduced WLRs. To match the observed thickness of WLRs required metal\nabundances at the inner disc wall that are of order ten times that of standard\nsolar abundances. The CAIs cooled as they moved away from the protosun, the\ndeduced CAI cooling rates are consistent with the CAI cooling rates obtained\nfrom experiment and observation. The speeds and gas densities required to form\nbowl-shaped CAIs are also consistent with the expected speeds and gas densities\nfor larger, ~ 1 cm, CAIs punching through an inner accretion disc wall.\n", "  Lead halide perovskite based micro- and nano- lasers have been widely studied\nin past two years. Due to their long carrier diffusion length and high external\nquantum efficiency, lead halide perovskites have been considered to have bright\nfuture in optoelectronic devices, especially in the \"green gap\" wavelength\nregion. However, the quality (Q) factors of perovskite lasers are unspectacular\ncompared to conventional microdisk lasers. The record value of full width at\nhalf maximum (FWHM) at threshold is still around 0.22 nm. Herein we synthesized\nsolution-processed, single-crystalline CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite microrods and\nstudied their lasing actions. In contrast to entirely pumping a microrod on\nsubstrate, we partially excited the microrods that were hanging in the air.\nConsequently, single-mode or few-mode laser emissions have been successfully\nobtained from the whispering-gallery like diamond modes, which are confined by\ntotal internal reflection within the transverse plane. Owning to the better\nlight confinement and high crystal quality, the FWHM at threshold have been\nsignificantly improved. The smallest FWHM at threshold is around 0.1 nm, giving\na Q factor over 5000.\n", "  [Background] Reactions with stable beams have demonstrated a strong interplay\nbetween nuclear structure and fusion. Exotic beam facilities open new\nperspectives to understand the impact of neutron skin, large isospin, and weak\nbinding energies on fusion. Microscopic theories of fusion are required to\nguide future experiments.\n  [Purpose] To investigate new effects of exotic structures and dynamics in\nnear-barrier fusion with exotic nuclei.\n  [Method] Microscopic approaches based on the Hartree-Fock (HF) mean-field\ntheory are used for studying fusion barriers in $^{40-54}$Ca+$^{116}$Sn\nreactions for even isotopes. Bare potential barriers are obtained assuming\nfrozen HF ground-state densities. Dynamical effects on the barrier are\naccounted for in time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) calculations of the\ncollisions. Vibrational couplings are studied in the coupled-channel framework\nand near-barrier nucleon transfer is investigated with TDHF calculations.\n  [Results] The development of a neutron skin in exotic calcium isotopes\nstrongly lowers the bare potential barrier. However, this static effect is not\napparent when dynamical effects are included. On the contrary, a fusion\nhindrance is observed in TDHF calculations with the most neutron rich calcium\nisotopes which cannot be explained by vibrational couplings. Transfer reactions\nare also important in these systems due to charge equilibration processes.\n  [Conclusions] Despite its impact on the bare potential, the neutron skin is\nnot seen as playing an important role in the fusion dynamics. However, the\ncharge transfer with exotic projectiles could lead to an increase of the\nCoulomb repulsion between the fragments, suppressing fusion. The effect of\ntransfer and dissipative mechanisms on fusion with exotic nuclei deserve\nfurther studies.\n", "  We describe some of the future measurements to be performed by the CMS, TOTEM\nand ATLAS collaborations on hard diffraction in order to understand better the\nstructure of the Pomeron. We also describe the prospects concerning the search\nfor quartic $\\gamma \\gamma \\gamma \\gamma$ anomalous couplings and discuss a\npossible interpretation for the existence of a new particle decaying into two\nphotons at a mass of about 750 GeV.\n", "  HR 8799 is a star accompanied by four massive planets on wide orbits. The\nobserved planetary configuration has been shown to be unstable on a timescale\nmuch shorter than the estimated age of the system (~ 30 Myr) unless the planets\nare locked into mean motion resonances. This condition is characterised by\nsmall-amplitude libration of one or more resonant angles that stabilise the\nsystem by preventing close encounters. We simulate planetary systems similar to\nthe HR 8799 planetary system, exploring the parameter space in separation\nbetween the orbits, planetary masses and distance from the Sun to the star. We\nfind systems that look like HR 8799 and remain stable for longer than the\nestimated age of HR 8799. None of our systems are forced into resonances. We\nfind, with nominal masses and in a narrow range of orbit separations, that 5 of\n100 systems match the observations and lifetime. Considering a broad range of\norbit separations, we find 12 of 900 similar systems. The systems survive\nsignificantly longer because of their slightly increased initial orbit\nseparations compared to assuming circular orbits from the observed positions. A\nsmall increase in separation leads to a significant increase in survival time.\nThe low eccentricity the orbits develop from gravitational interaction is\nenough for the planets to match the observations. With lower masses, but still\ncomfortably within the estimated planet mass uncertainty, we find 18 of 100\nmatching and long-lived systems in a narrow orbital separation range. In the\nbroad separation range, we find 82 of 900 matching systems. Our results imply\nthat the planets in the HR 8799 system do not have to be in strong mean motion\nresonances.\n", "  We present the stellar mass functions (SMFs) of passive and star-forming\ngalaxies with a limiting mass of 10$^{10.1}$ M$_{\\odot}$ in four\nspectroscopically confirmed Spitzer Adaptation of the Red-sequence Cluster\nSurvey (SpARCS) galaxy clusters at 1.37 $<$ z $<$ 1.63. The clusters have 113\nspectroscopically confirmed members combined, with 8-45 confirmed members each.\nWe construct $Ks$-band-selected photometric catalogs for each cluster with an\naverage of 11 photometric bands ranging from $u$ to 8 $\\mu$m. We compare our\ncluster galaxies to a field sample derived from a similar $Ks$-band-selected\ncatalog in the UltraVISTA/COSMOS field. The SMFs resemble those of the field,\nbut with signs of environmental quenching. We find that 30 $\\pm$ 20\\% of\ngalaxies that would normally be forming stars in the field are quenched in the\nclusters. The environmental quenching efficiency shows little dependence on\nprojected cluster-centric distance out to $\\sim$ 4 Mpc, providing tentative\nevidence of pre-processing and/or galactic conformity in this redshift range.\nWe also compile the available data on environmental quenching efficiencies from\nthe literature, and find that the quenching efficiency in clusters and in\ngroups appears to decline with increasing redshift in a manner consistent with\nprevious results and expectations based on halo mass growth.\n", "  We propose a scenario for the generation of baryon number asymmetry based on\nthe inflaton decay in a radiative neutrino mass model extended with singlet\nscalars. In this scenario, lepton number asymmetry is produced through the\ndecay of non-thermal right-handed neutrinos caused from the inflaton decay.\nSince the amount of non-thermal right-handed neutrinos could be much larger\nthan the thermal ones, the scenario could work without any resonance effect for\nrather low reheating temperature. Sufficient baryon number asymmetry can be\ngenerated for much lighter right-handed neutrinos compared with the\nDavidson-Ibarra bound.\n", "  Vortex shedding from a microsphere oscillating in superfluid $^4$He at mK\ntemperatures is compared with that from a laser beam moving in a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC) as observed by other authors. In particular, in either case a\nlinear dependence of the shedding frequency $f_v$ on $\\Delta v = v - v_c$ is\nobserved, where $v$ is the velocity amplitude of the sphere or the constant\nvelocity of the laser beam above a critical velocity $v_c$ for the onset of\nturbulent flow: $f_v = a \\,\\Delta v$, where the coefficient $a$ is proportional\nto the oscillation frequency $ \\omega $above some characteristic frequency\n$\\omega_k$ and assumes a finite value for steady motion $\\omega \\rightarrow 0$.\n", "  We present a catalog of uniformly determined stellar properties and\nabundances for 1626 F, G, and K stars using an automated spectral synthesis\nmodeling procedure. All stars were observed using the HIRES spectrograph at\nKeck Observatory. Our procedure used a single line list to fit model spectra to\nobservations of all stars to determine effective temperature, surface gravity,\nmetallicity, projected rotational velocity, and the abundances of 15 elements\n(C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, & Y). Sixty percent of the\nsample had Hipparcos parallaxes and V-band photometry which we combined with\nthe spectroscopic results to obtain mass, radius, and luminosity. Additionally,\nwe used the luminosity, effective temperature, metallicity and alpha-element\nenhancement to interpolate in the Yonsei-Yale isochrones to derive mass,\nradius, gravity, and age ranges for those stars. Finally, we determined new\nrelations between effective temperature and macroturbulence for dwarfs and\nsubgiants. Our analysis achieved precisions of 25 K in Teff , 0.01 dex in\n[M/H], 0.028 dex for log g and 0.5 km/s in v sin ibased on multiple\nobservations of the same stars. The abundance results were similarly precise,\nbetween 0.01 and - 0.04 dex, though trends with respect to Teff remained for\nwhich we derived empirical corrections. The trends, though small, were much\nlarger than our uncertainties and are shared with published abundances. We show\nthat changing our model atmosphere grid accounts for most of the trend in [M/H]\nbetween 5000 K and 5500 K indicating a possible problem with the atmosphere\nmodels or opacities.\n", "  4D Higgs field is identified with the extra-dimensional component of gauge\npotentials in the gauge-Higgs unification scenario. $SO(5) \\times U(1)$\ngauge-Higgs EW unification in the Randall-Sundrum warped space is successful at\nlow energies. The Higgs field appears as an Aharonov-Bohm phase $\\theta_H$ in\nthe fifth dimension. Its mass is generated at the quantum level and is finite.\nThe model yields almost the same phenomenology as the standard model for\n$\\theta_H < 0.1$, and predicts $Z'$ bosons around 6 - 10 TeV with very broad\nwidths. The scenario is genelarized to $SO(11)$ gauge-Higgs grand unification.\nFermions are introduced in the spinor and vector representations of $SO(11)$.\nProton decay is naturally forbidden.\n", "  The influence of electric stochastic fields on the relativistic charged\nparticles is investigated in the gauge invariant path integral formalism. Using\nthe cumulant expansion one finds the exponential relaxation of the charge\nGreen's function both for spinless and Dirac charges.\n", "  Hydrogen intercalation in solids is common, complicated, and very difficult\nto monitor. In a new approach to the problem, we have studied the profile of\nhydrogen diffusion in single-crystal nanobeams and plates of VO2, exploiting\nthe fact that hydrogen doping in this material leads to visible darkening near\nroom temperature connected with the metal-insulator transition at 65 {\\deg}C.\nWe observe hydrogen diffusion along the rutile c-axis but not perpendicular to\nit, making this a highly one-dimensional diffusion system. We obtain an\nactivated diffusion coefficient, ~0.01 e^(-0.6 eV/k_B T) cm2sec-1, applicable\nin metallic phase. In addition, we observe dramatic supercooling of the\nhydrogen-induced metallic phase and spontaneous segregation of the hydrogen\ninto stripes implying that the diffusion process is highly nonlinear, even in\nthe absence of defects. Similar complications may occur in hydrogen motion in\nother materials but are not revealed by conventional measurement techniques.\n", "  In living cells, chemical reactions are connected by sharing their products\nand substrates, and form complex networks, e.g. metabolic pathways. Here we\ndeveloped a theory to predict the sensitivity, i.e. the responses of\nconcentrations and fluxes to perturbations of enzymes, from network structure\nalone. Responses turn out to exhibit two characteristic patterns,\n$localization$ and $hierarchy$. We present a general theorem connecting\nsensitivity with network topology that explains these characteristic patterns.\nOur results imply that network topology is an origin of biological robustness.\nFinally, we suggest a strategy to determine real networks from experimental\nmeasurements.\n", "  Emergence of ferromagnetism in non-magnetic semiconductors is strongly\ndesirable, especially in topological materials thanks to the possibility to\nachieve quantum anomalous Hall effect. Based on first-principles calculations,\nwe propose that for Si thin film grown on metal substrate, the pristine\nSi(111)-root3xroot3 surface with a spontaneous weak reconstruction has a strong\ntendency of ferromagnetism and nontrivial topological properties, characterized\nby spin polarized Dirac-fermion surface states. In contrast to conventional\nroutes relying on introduction of alien charge carriers or specially patterned\nsubstrates, the spontaneous magnetic order and spin-orbit coupling on the\npristine silicon surface together gives rise to quantized anomalous Hall effect\nwith a finite Chern number C=-1. This work suggests exciting opportunities in\nsilicon-based spintronics and quantum computing free from alien dopants or\nproximity effects.\n", "  We study the phase sensitivity in the conventional $SU(2)$ and\nnonconventional $SU(1,1)$ interferometers with the coherent and squeezed vacuum\ninput state via the quantum Cramer-Rao bound. We explicitly construct the\ndetection scheme that gives the optimal phase sensitivity. For practical\npurposes, we show that in the presence of photon loss, both interferometers\nwith proper homodyne detections, are nearly optimal. We also find that unlike\nthe coherent state and squeezed vacuum state, the effects of the imperfect\ndetector on the phase sensitivity cannot be asymptotically removed for a\ngeneric coherent-squeezed state by increasing the amplifier gain of the OPA.\n", "  Silica-based anchored-membrane waveguides (T-Guides) are fabricated and\ncharacterized from the visible to infrared with streak imaging. It is\nnumerically shown that the T-Guides can have wideband single-mode and\nsingle-polarization (SMSP) properties over a span of 2.6 octaves.\nExperimentally, a polarization-dependent loss difference of up to 90 dB/cm is\nmeasured between orthogonal polarizations, and a record SMSP window of >1.27\noctaves is observed, limited only by the available measurement equipment. These\nmeasurements make a strong case for T-Guides for SMSP photonics, particularly\non high-index materials such as our previous demonstration on silicon.\n", "  We present new viscosity and equation of state (EoS) results extending to\nhigh pressures for o-terphenyl, salol, and dibutylphthalate. Using these and\ndata from the literature, we show that the three liquids all conform to density\nscaling; that is, their reduce viscosities and reorientational relaxation times\nare a function of the ratio of temperature and density with the latter raised\nto a constant. Moreover, the functional form of the dependence on this ratio is\nindependent of the experimental probe of the dynamics. This means that there is\nno decoupling of the viscosities and relaxation times over the measured range\nof conditions. Previous literature at odds with these results were based on\nerroneous extrapolations of the EoS or problematic diamond anvil viscosity\ndata. Thus, there are no exceptions to the experimental fact that every\nnon-associated liquid complies with density scaling with an invariant scaling\nexponent.\n", "  It is widely recognised that the effect of doping into a Mott insulator is\ncomplicated and unpredictable, as can be seen by examining the Hall coefficient\nin high $T_{\\rm c}$ cuprates. The doping effect, including the electron-hole\ndoping asymmetry, may be more straightforward in doped organic Mott insulators\nowing to their simple electronic structures. Here we investigate the doping\nasymmetry of an organic Mott insulator by carrying out electric-double-layer\ntransistor measurements and using cluster perturbation theory. The calculations\npredict that strongly anisotropic suppression of the spectral weight results in\nthe Fermi arc state under hole doping, while a relatively uniform spectral\nweight results in the emergence of a non-interacting-like Fermi surface in the\nelectron-doped state. In accordance with the calculations, the experimentally\nobserved Hall coefficients and resistivity anisotropy correspond to the pocket\nformed by the Fermi arcs under hole doping and to the non-interacting Fermi\nsurface under electron doping.\n", "  Employing the high-resolution observations from the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO) and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), we\nstatistically investigate flux rope proxies in NOAA AR 11897 from 14-Nov-2013\nto 19-Nov-2013 and display two fan-spine structures in this AR. For the first\ntime, we detect flux rope proxies of NOAA 11897 for total 30 times in 4\ndifferent locations. These flux rope proxies were either tracked in both lower\nand higher temperature wavelengths or only detected in hot channels. Specially,\nnone of these flux rope proxies was observed to erupt, but just faded away\ngradually. In addition to these flux rope proxies, we firstly detect a\nsecondary fan-spine structure. It was covered by dome-shaped magnetic fields\nwhich belong to a larger fan-spine topology. These new observations imply that\nconsiderable amounts of flux ropes can exist in an AR and the complexity of AR\nmagnetic configuration is far beyond our imagination.\n", "  Infrared spectroscopy, especially for molecular vibrations in the fingerprint\nregion between 600 and 1500 cm-1, is a powerful characterization method for\nbulk materials. However, molecular fingerprinting at the nanoscale level still\nremains a significant challenge, due to weak light-matter interaction between\nmicron-wavelengthed infrared light and nano-sized molecules. Here, we\ndemonstrate molecular fingerprinting at the nanoscale level using our specially\ndesigned graphene plasmonic structure on CaF2 nanofilm. This structure not only\navoids the plasmon-phonon hybridization, but also provides in situ\nelectrically-tunable graphene plasmon covering the entire infrared fingerprint\nregion, which was previously unattainable. In addition, undisturbed and\nhighly-confined graphene plasmon offers simultaneous detection of in-plane and\nout-of-plane vibrational modes with ultrahigh detection sensitivity down to the\nsub-monolayer level, significantly pushing the current detection limit of\nfar-field mid-infrared spectroscopy. Our results provide a platform, fulfilling\nthe long-awaited expectation of high sensitivity and selectivity far-field\nfingerprint detection of nano-scale molecules for numerous applications.\n", "  We show that radiofrequency (RF) radiation may be used to create Feshbach\nresonances in ultracold gases of alkali-metal atoms at desired magnetic fields\nthat are convenient for atomic cooling and degeneracy. For the case of\n$^{39}$K+$^{133}$Cs, where there are no RF-free resonances in regions where Cs\nmay be cooled to degeneracy, we show that a resonance may be created near 21~G\nwith 69.2~MHz RF radiation. This resonance is almost lossless with circularly\npolarized RF, and the molecules created are long-lived even with\nplane-polarized RF.\n", "  Diffraction of matter-waves is an important demonstration of the fact that\nobjects in nature possess a mixture of particle-like and wave-like properties.\nUnlike in the case of light diffraction, matter-waves are subject to a\nvacuum-mediated interaction with diffraction obstacles. Here we present a\ndetailed account of this effect through the calculation of the attractive\nCasimir-Polder potential between a dielectric sphere and an atomic beam.\nFurthermore, we use our calculated potential to make predictions about the\ndiffraction patterns to be observed in an ongoing experiment where a beam of\nindium atoms is diffracted around a silicon dioxide sphere. The result is an\namplification of the on-axis bright feature which is the matter-wave analogue\nof the well-known `Poisson spot' from optics. Our treatment confirms that the\ndiffraction patterns resulting from our complete account of the sphere\nCasimir-Polder potential are indistinguishable from those found via a\nlarge-sphere non-retarded approximation in the discussed experiments,\nestablishing the latter as an adequate model.\n", "  Perturbative QCD with nf flavours of massless quarks becomes simple in the\nhypothetical limit nf -> 16.5, where the leading beta-function coefficient\nvanishes. The Banks-Zaks (BZ) expansion in a0=(8/321)(16.5-nf) is\nstraightforward to obtain from perturbative results in MSbar or any\nrenormalization scheme (RS) whose nf dependence is `regular.' However,\n`irregular' RS's are perfectly permissible and should ultimately lead to the\nsame BZ results. We show here that the `optimal' RS determined by the Principle\nof Minimal Sensitivity does yield the same BZ-expansion results when all orders\nof perturbation theory are taken into account. The BZ limit provides an arena\nfor exploring optimized perturbation theory at arbitrarily high orders. These\nexplorations are facilitated by a `master equation' expressing the optimization\nconditions in the fixed-point limit. We find an intriguing strong/weak coupling\nduality a -> a*^2/a about the fixed point a*.\n", "  Orbital degrees of freedom in condensed matters could play important roles in\nforming a variety of exotic electronic states by interacting with conduction\nelectrons. In 4f electron systems, because of strong intra-atomic spin-orbit\ncoupling, an orbitally degenerate state inherently carries quadrupolar degrees\nof freedom. The present work has focussed on a purely quadrupole-active system\nPrIr2Zn20 showing superconductivity in the presence of an antiferroquadrupole\norder at TQ = 0.11 K. We observed non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behaviors emerging in\nthe electrical resistivity and the 4f contribution to the specific heat, C_4f,\nin the paramagnetic state at T > TQ. Moreover, in magnetic fields below 6 T,\nall data set of the electrical resistivity and C_4f(T) are well scaled with\ncharacteristic temperatures T0's. This is the first observation of the NFL\nstate in the nonmagnetic quadrupole-active system, whose origin is\nintrinsically different from that observed in the vicinity of the conventional\nquantum critical point. It implies possible formation of a quadrupole Kondo\nlattice resulting from hybridization between the quadrupoles and the conduction\nelectrons. Below 0.13 K, the electrical resistivity and C_4f(T) exhibit\nanomalies as B approaches 5 T. This is the manifestation of a field-induced\ncrossover toward a Fermi-liquid ground state in the quadrupole Kondo lattice.\n", "  In diffuse molecular clouds, possible precursors of star-forming clouds, the\neffect of the magnetic field is unclear. In this work we compare the\norientations of filamentary structures in the Polaris Flare, as seen through\ndust emission by Herschel, to the plane-of-the-sky magnetic field orientation\n($\\rm B_{pos}$) as revealed by stellar optical polarimetry with RoboPol. Dust\nstructures in this translucent cloud show a strong preference for alignment\nwith $\\rm B_{pos}$. 70 % of field orientations are consistent with those of the\nfilaments (within 30$^\\circ$). We explore the spatial variation of the relative\norientations and find it to be uncorrelated with the dust emission intensity\nand correlated to the dispersion of polarization angles. Concentrating in the\narea around the highest column density filament, and in the region with the\nmost uniform field, we infer the $\\rm B_{pos}$ strength to be 24 $-$ 120\n$\\mu$G. Assuming that the magnetic field can be decomposed into a turbulent and\nan ordered component, we find a turbulent-to-ordered ratio of 0.2 $-$ 0.8,\nimplying that the magnetic field is dynamically important, at least in these\ntwo areas. We discuss implications on the 3D field properties, as well as on\nthe distance estimate of the cloud.\n", "  In this article, we explore the low energy structure of a $U(3)$ gauge theory\nover spaces with fuzzy sphere(s) as extra dimensions. In particular, we\ndetermine the equivariant parametrization of the gauge fields, which transform\neither invariantly or as vectors under the combined action of $SU(2)$ rotations\nof the fuzzy spheres and those $U(3)$ gauge transformations generated by $SU(2)\n\\subset U(3)$ carrying the spin $1$ irreducible representation of $SU(2)$. The\ncases of a single fuzzy sphere $S_F^2$ and a particular direct sum of\nconcentric fuzzy spheres, $S_F^{2 \\, Int}$, covering the monopole bundle\nsectors with windings $\\pm 1$ are treated in full and the low energy degrees of\nfreedom for the gauge fields are obtained. Employing the parametrizations of\nthe fields in the former case, we determine a low energy action by tracing over\nthe fuzzy sphere and show that the emerging model is abelian Higgs type with\n$U(1) \\times U(1)$ gauge symmetry and possess vortex solutions on ${\\mathbb\nR}^2$, which we discuss in some detail. Generalization of our formulation to\nthe equivariant parametrization of gauge fields in $U(n)$ theories is also\nbriefly addressed.\n", "  An aging population is bringing new challenges to the management of escape\nroutes and facility design in many countries. This paper investigates\npedestrian movement properties of crowd with different age compositions. Three\npedestrian groups are considered: young student group, old people group and\nmixed group. It is found that traffic jams occur more frequently in mixed group\ndue to the great differences of mobilities and self-adaptive abilities among\npedestrians. The jams propagate backward with a velocity 0.4 m/s for global\ndensity around 1.75 m-1 and 0.3 m/s for higher than 2.3 m-1. The fundamental\ndiagrams of the three groups are obviously different from each other and cannot\nbe unified into one diagram by direct non-dimensionalization. Unlike previous\nstudies, three linear regimes in mixed group but only two regimes in young\nstudent group are observed in the headway-velocity relation, which is also\nverified in the fundamental diagram. Different ages and mobilities of\npedestrians in a crowd cause the heterogeneity of system and influence the\nproperties of pedestrian dynamics significantly. It indicates that the density\nis not the only factor leading to jams in pedestrian traffic. The composition\nof crowd has to be considered in understanding pedestrian dynamics and facility\ndesign.\n", "  We investigate in this paper magnetic properties of the perovskite compound\n(La0.56Ce0.14)Sr0.30MnO3. The method we use here is Monte Carlo simulation, in\nwhich we take into account different kinds of interactions between nearest and\nbetween next-nearest magnetic ions Mn 3+ (S = 2) , Mn 4+ (S = 3/2) and Ce 3+ (S\n= 1/2). Using a classical spin model, we have calculated the internal energy,\nthe magnetization per ion type and their corresponding magnetic susceptibility,\nas well as the Edwards-Anderson order parameter for each ion kind. We also\nstudied the applied-field effect on the system magnetization. Our results show\na good agreement with experiments.\n", "  The Rabi model, a two-level atom coupled to a harmonic oscillator, can\nundergo a second-order quantum phase transition (QPT) [M. -J. Hwang et al,\nPhys. Rev. Lett. 115, 180404 (2015)]. Here we show that the Rabi QPT\naccompanies critical behavior in the higher energy excited states, i.e., the\nexcited-state QPT (ESQPT). We derive analytic expressions for the semiclassical\ndensity of states, which shows a logarithmic divergence at a critical energy\neigenvalue in the broken symmetry (superradiant) phase. Moreover, we find that\nthe logarithmic singularities in the density of states leads to singularities\nin the relevant observables in the system such as photon number and atomic\npolarization. We corroborate our analytical semiclassical prediction of the\nESQPT in the Rabi model with its numerically exact quantum mechanical solution.\n", "  We derive the hydrodynamic equations for nematic liquid crystals lying on\ncurved substrates. We invoke the Lagrange-Rayleigh variational principle to\nadapt the Ericksen-Leslie theory to two-dimensional nematics in which a\ndegenerate anchoring of the molecules on the substrate is enforced. The only\nconstitutive assumptions in this scheme concern the free-energy density, given\nby the two-dimensional Frank potential, and the density of dissipation which is\nrequired to satisfy appropriate invariance requirements. The resulting\nequations of motion couple the velocity field, the director alignment and the\ncurvature of the shell. To illustrate our findings, we consider the effect of a\nsimple shear flow on the alignment of a nematic lying on a cylindrical shell.\n", "  Intermediate-velocity clouds (IVCs) are HI halo clouds that are likely\nrelated to a Galactic fountain process. In-falling IVCs are candidates for the\nre-accretion of matter onto the Milky Way. We study the evolution of IVCs at\nthe disk-halo interface, focussing on the transition from atomic to molecular\nIVCs. We compare an atomic IVC to a molecular IVC and characterise their\nstructural differences in order to investigate how molecular IVCs form high\nabove the Galactic plane. With high-resolution HI observations of the\nWesterbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and 12CO(1-0) and 13CO(1-0) observations\nwith the IRAM 30m telescope, we analyse the small-scale structures within the\ntwo clouds. By correlating HI and far-infrared (FIR) dust continuum emission\nfrom the Planck satellite, the distribution of molecular hydrogen (H2) is\nestimated. We conduct a detailed comparison of the HI, FIR, and CO data and\nstudy variations of the $X_\\rm{CO}$ conversion factor. The atomic IVC does not\ndisclose detectable CO emission. The atomic small-scale structure, as revealed\nby the high-resolution HI data, shows low peak HI column densities and low HI\nfluxes as compared to the molecular IVC. The molecular IVC exhibits a rich\nmolecular structure and most of the CO emission is observed at the eastern edge\nof the cloud. There is observational evidence that the molecular IVC is in a\ntransient and, thus, non-equilibrium phase. The average $X_\\rm{CO}$ factor is\nclose to the canonical value of the Milky Way disk. We propose that the two\nIVCs represent different states in a gradual transition from atomic to\nmolecular clouds. The molecular IVC appears to be more condensed allowing the\nformation of H2 and CO in shielded regions all over the cloud. Ram pressure may\naccumulate gas and thus facilitate the formation of H2. We show evidence that\nthe atomic IVC will evolve also into a molecular IVC in a few Myr.\n", "  We study the effects of a finite cubic volume with twisted boundary\nconditions on pseudoscalar mesons. We first apply chiral perturbation theory in\nthe p-regime and calculate the corrections for masses, decay constants,\npseudoscalar coupling constants and form factors at next-to-leading order. We\nshow that the Feynman-Hellmann theorem and the relevant Ward-Takahashi identity\nare satisfied. We then derive asymptotic formulae a la Luscher for twisted\nboundary conditions. We show that chiral Ward identities for masses and decay\nconstants are satisfied by the asymptotic formulae in finite volume as a\nconsequence of infinite-volume Ward identities. Applying asymptotic formulae in\ncombination with chiral perturbation theory we estimate corrections beyond\nnext-to-leading order for twisted boundary conditions.\n", "  We present spatially-resolved Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array\n(ALMA) 870 $\\mu$m dust continuum maps of six massive, compact, dusty\nstar-forming galaxies (SFGs) at $z\\sim2.5$. These galaxies are selected for\ntheir small rest-frame optical sizes ($r_{\\rm e, F160W}\\sim1.6$ kpc) and high\nstellar-mass densities that suggest that they are direct progenitors of compact\nquiescent galaxies at $z\\sim2$. The deep observations yield high far-infrared\n(FIR) luminosities of L$_{\\rm IR}=10^{12.3-12.8}$ L$_{\\odot}$ and star\nformation rates (SFRs) of SFR$=200-700$ M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, consistent with\nthose of typical star-forming \"main sequence\" galaxies. The high-spatial\nresolution (FWHM$\\sim$0.12\"-0.18\") ALMA and HST photometry are combined to\nconstruct deconvolved, mean radial profiles of their stellar mass and (UV+IR)\nSFR. We find that the dusty, nuclear IR-SFR overwhelmingly dominates the\nbolometric SFR up to $r\\sim5$ kpc, by a factor of over 100$\\times$ from the\nunobscured UV-SFR. Furthermore, the effective radius of the mean SFR profile\n($r_{\\rm e, SFR}\\sim1$ kpc) is $\\sim$30% smaller than that of the stellar mass\nprofile. The implied structural evolution, if such nuclear starburst last for\nthe estimated gas depletion time of $\\Delta t=\\pm100$ Myr, is a 4$\\times$\nincrease of the stellar mass density within the central 1 kpc and a 1.6$\\times$\ndecrease of the half-mass radius. This structural evolution fully supports\ndissipation-driven, formation scenarios in which strong nuclear starbursts\ntransform larger, star-forming progenitors into compact quiescent galaxies.\n", "  We perform automated bulge + disc decomposition on a sample of $\\sim$7500\ngalaxies from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey in the redshift range\nof 0.002$<$z$<$0.06 using SIGMA, a wrapper around GALFIT3. To achieve robust\nprofile measurements we use a novel approach of repeatedly fitting the\ngalaxies, varying the input parameters to sample a large fraction of the input\nparameter space. Using this method we reduce the catastrophic failure rate\nsignificantly and verify the confidence in the fit independently of $\\chi^2$.\nAdditionally, using the median of the final fitting values and the 16$^{th}$\nand 84$^{th}$ percentile produces more realistic error estimates than those\nprovided by GALFIT, which are known to be underestimated. We use the results of\nour decompositions to analyse the stellar mass - half-light radius relations of\nbulges, discs and spheroids. We further investigate the association of\ncomponents with a parent disc or elliptical relation to provide definite $z=0$\ndisc and spheroid $\\mathcal{M_\\star}-R_{\\rm e}$ relations. We conclude by\ncomparing our local disc and spheroid $\\mathcal{M_\\star}-R_{\\rm e}$ to\nsimulated data from EAGLE and high redshift data from CANDELS-UDS. We show the\npotential of using the mass-size relation to study galaxy evolution in both\ncases but caution that for a fair comparison all data sets need to be processed\nand analysed in the same manner.\n", "  The evolution of a crack front under mixed mode loading (I+III) is studied\nusing a phase field model in 3 dimensions with no stress boundary conditions.\nAs previously observed experimentally in gels, there is a relaxation toward a\ngeometry where $K_{III}=0$ without any front fragmentation even for high values\nof the initial mode mixity $K_{III}/K_{I}$. The effects of the initial\ncondition is studied and it is shown that irregularities in the initial slit\ncan lead to front fragmentation for smaller values of the ratio $K_{III}/K_{I}$\nas is observed in experiments.\n", "  We investigate the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects on pairwise\nentanglement dynamics of a collective of non-interacting qubits which have been\ninitially prepared in a Werner state and are off-resonantly coupled to a common\nand non-Markovian environment. We obtain the analytical expression of the\nconcurrence in the absence and presence of the non-selective measurements. In\nparticular, we express our results in the strong and weak coupling regimes and\nexamine the role of the system size, and the effect of the detuning from the\ncavity field frequency on the temporal behaviour of the pairwise entanglement.\nWe show that, the detuning parameter has a positive role in the protection of\nentanglement in the absence of the measurement for weak coupling regime. We\nfind that for the values of detuning parameter less than the cavity damping\nrate, the quantum Zeno effect is always dominant, while for the values greater\nthan the cavity damping rate, both Zeno and anti-Zeno effects can occur,\ndepending on the measurement intervals. We also find that the anti-Zeno effect\ncan occur in the pairwise entanglement dynamics in the absence and presence of\nthe detuning in the strong coupling regime.\n", "  We present the state-of-the-art of the light-cone sum rule approach to Baryon\nform factors. The essence of this approach is that soft Feynman contributions\nare calculated in terms of small transverse distance quantities using\ndispersion relations and duality. The form factors are thus expressed in terms\nof nucleon wave functions at small transverse separations, called distribution\namplitudes, without any additional parameters. The distribution amplitudes,\ntherefore, can be extracted from the comparison with the experimental data on\nform factors and compared to the results of lattice QCD simulations.\n", "  A (n+1)-dimensional gravitational model with Gauss-Bonnet term and\ncosmological constant term is considered. When ansatz with diagonal\ncosmological metrics is adopted, the solutions with exponential dependence of\nscale factors: a_i ~ exp( v^i t), i = 1, ..., n, are analysed for n > 3. We\nstudy the stability of the solutions with non-static volume factor, i.e. if\nK(v) = \\sum_{k = 1}^{n} v^k \\neq 0. We prove that under certain restriction R\nimposed solutions with K(v) > 0 are stable while solutions with K(v) < 0 are\nunstable. Certain examples of stable solutions are presented. We show that the\nsolutions with v^1 = v^2 = v^3 = H > 0 and zero variation of the effective\ngravitational constant are stable if the restriction R is obeyed.\n", "  We investigate the emergence of different kinds of imperfect synchronized\nstates and chimera states in two interacting populations of nonlocally coupled\nStuart-Landau oscillators. We find that the complete synchronization in\npopulation-I and existence of solitary oscillators which escape from the\nsynchronized group in population-II lead to imperfect synchronized states for\nsufficiently small values of nonisochronicity parameter. Interestingly, on\nincreasing the strength of this parameter further there occurs an onset of\nmixed imperfect synchronized states where the solitary oscillators occur from\nboth the populations. Synchronized oscillators from both the populations are\nlocked to a common average frequency. In both the cases of imperfect\nsynchronized states synchronized oscillators exhibit periodic motion while the\nsolitary oscillators are quasi-periodic in nature. In this region, for\nspatially prepared initial conditions, we can observe the mixed chimera states\nwhere the coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized oscillations occur\nfrom both the populations. On the other hand, imperfect synchronized states are\nnot always stable, and they can drift aperiodically due to instability caused\nby an increase of nonisochronicity parameter. We observe that these states are\nrobust to the introduction of frequency mismatch between the two populations.\n", "  An atomic and electronic structure of the bulk and thin-film morphologies of\nZnO were modified using pulsed Bi-ion implantation (1x1017 cm-2 fluence, 70 min\nexposure under Bi-ion beam, EBi+ = 30 keV, pulsed ion-current density of not\nmore than 0.8 mA/cm2 with a repetition rate of 12.5 Hz). The final samples were\nqualified by X-ray photoelectron core-level and valence band mapping\nspectroscopy applying ASTM materials science standard. The spectroscopy data\nobtained was discussed on the basis of DFT-models for Bi-embedding into ZnO\nhost-matrices. It was established that in the case of direct Bi-impurities\ninsertion into the employed ZnO-host for both studied morphologies neither the\nonly \"pure\" Bi2O3-like phase nor the only \"pure\" Bi-metal will be preferable to\nappear as a secondary phase. An unfavorability of the large cluster\nagglomeration of Bi-impurities in ZnO-hosts has been shown and an oxygen 2s\nelectronic states pleomorphizm was surely established.\n", "  We study the effect of charged secondaries coming from resonance decay on the\nnet-baryon, net-charge and net-strangeness fluctuations in high energy\nheavy-ion collisions within the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model. We emphasize\nthe importance of including weak decays along with other resonance decays in\nthe HRG, while comparing with the experimental observables. The effect of\nkinematic cuts on resonances and primordial particles on the conserved number\nfluctuations are also studied. The HRG model calculations with the inclusion of\nresonance decays and kinematical cuts are compared with the recent experimental\ndata from STAR and PHENIX experiments. We find a good agreement between our\nmodel calculations and the experimental measurements for both net-proton and\nnet-charge distributions.\n", "  Using acoustic methods the complex high-frequency conductance of\nhigh-mobility $n$-GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures was determined in magnetic\nfields 12$\\div$18~T. Based on the observed frequency and temperature\ndependences we conclude that in the investigated magnetic field range and at\nsufficiently low temperatures, $T \\lesssim 200$~mK, the electron system forms a\nWigner crystal deformed due to pinning by disorder. At some temperature, which\ndepends on the electron filling factor, the temperature dependences of both\ncomponents of the complex conductance get substantially changed. We have\nascribed this rapid change of the conduction mechanism to melting of the Wigner\ncrystal and study the dependence of the so-defined melting temperature on the\nelectron filling factor.\n", "  We present first-principles total-energy electronic-structure calculations\nthat provide the microscopic mechanism of the adatom interchange reaction on\nthe Sn- and Pb-covered Ge(111)-(2x8) and the Sb-covered Si(111)-(7x7) surfaces\nwith and without the tip of the atomic force microscope (AFM). We find that,\nwithout the presence of the AFM tip on the Ge surface, the adatom interchange\noccurs through the migration of the adatom, the spontaneous formation of the\ndimer structures of the two adatoms, the dimer-dimer structural transitions\nthat induce the exchange of the positions of the two adatoms, and then the\nbackward migration of the adatom. We also find that the dimer structure is\nunfeasible at room temperature on the Si surface and the adatom interchange are\nhereby unlikely. With the presence of the tip, we find that the reaction\npathways are essentially the same for the Ge surface but that the energy\nbarriers of the migration and the exchange processes are substantially reduced\nby the AFM tip. We further find that the AFM tip induces the spontaneous\nformation of the dimer structure even on the Si surface, hereby opening a\nchannel of the interchange of the adatoms. Our calculations show that the bond\nformation between the AFM tip atom and the surface adatom is essential for the\natom manipulation using the AFM tip.\n", "  We discuss anharmonicity of the multi-octupole-phonon states in $^{208}$Pb\nbased on a covariant density functional theory, by fully taking into account\nthe interplay between the quadrupole and the octupole degrees of freedom. Our\nresults indicate the existence of a large anharmonicity in the transition\nstrengths, even though the excitation energies are similar to those in the\nharmonic limit. We also show that the quadrupole-shape fluctuation\nsignificantly enhances the fragmentation of the two-octupole-phonon states in\n$^{208}$Pb. Using those transition strengths as inputs to coupled channels\ncalculations, we then discuss the fusion reaction of $^{16}$O+$^{208}$Pb at\nenergies around the Coulomb barrier. We show that the anharmonicity of the\noctupole vibrational excitation considerably improves previous coupled-channels\ncalculations in the harmonic oscillator limit, significantly reducing the\nheight of the main peak in the fusion barrier distribution.\n", "  We investigate the collective excitation effect in a scheme where three\nidentical Rydberg atoms are arranged in an equilateral triangular lattice. By\nusing a static electric field polarizing the atomic dipoles, the dipole-dipole\ninteractions between two Rydberg atoms are essentially anisotropic and can even\ndisappear in the several special resonance cases. For that fact, we observe\ncollectively enhanced excitation probability of single Rydberg atom in resonant\nareas in the case of strong blockade, and that of double or triple Rydberg\natoms in the case of partial blockade. To give more evidences for this\ncollective excitation enhancement, we study the two-body quantum correlation\nbetween three Rydberg atoms, as well as the dependence of the blockade radius\non the length of triangle sides, which present a good agreement with the\nexcitation properties.\n", "  A statistical method for the estimation of spatial correlation lengths of\nGaussian-shaped fluctuating signals with two measurement points is examined to\nquantitatively evaluate its reliability (variance) and accuracy (bias error).\nThe standard deviation of the correlation value is analytically derived for\nrandomly distributed Gaussian shaped fluctuations satisfying stationarity and\nhomogeneity, allowing us to evaluate, as a function of fluctuation-to-noise\nratios, sizes of averaging time windows and ratios of the distance between the\ntwo measurement points to the true correlation length, the goodness of the\ntwo-point measurement for estimating the spatial correlation length. Analytic\nresults are confirmed with numerically generated synthetic data and real\nexperimental data obtained with the KSTAR beam emission spectroscopy\ndiagnostic. Our results can be applied to Gaussian-shaped fluctuating signals\nwhere a correlation length must be measured with only two measurement points.\n", "  We use a canonical quantization procedure to set up a quantum\nFokker-Planck-Kramers equation that accounts for quantum dissipation in a\nthermal environment. The dissipation term is chosen to ensure that the\nthermodynamic equilibrium is described by the Gibbs state. An expression for\nthe quantum entropy production is also provided which properly describes\nquantum systems in a nonequilibrium stationary state. The time-dependent\nsolution is given for a quantum harmonic oscillator in contact with a heat\nbath. We also obtain the stationary solution for a system of two coupled\nharmonic oscillators in contact with reservoirs at distinct temperatures, from\nwhich we obtain the entropy production and the quantum thermal conductance.\n", "  In this short paper we investigate quantum gravitational effects on\nEinstein's equations using effective field theory techniques. We consider the\nleading order quantum gravitational correction to the wave equation. Besides\nthe usual massless mode, we find a pair of modes with complex masses. These\nmassive particles have a width and could thus lead to a damping of\ngravitational waves if excited in violent astrophysical processes producing\ngravitational waves such as e.g. black hole mergers. We discuss the\nconsequences for gravitational wave events such as GW 150914 recently observed\nby the Advanced LIGO collaboration.\n", "  In order to test the capabilities of Barium Fluoride (BaF2) Crystal for dark\nmatter direct detection, nuclear recoils are studied with mono-energetic\nneutron beam. The energy spectra of nuclear recoils, quenching factors for\nelastic scattering neutrons and discrimination capability between neutron\ninelastic scattering events and {\\gamma} events are obtained for various recoil\nenergies of the F content in BaF2.\n", "  We present the first results on the saturation of the f-mode instability in\nneutron stars, due to nonlinear mode coupling. Emission of gravitational waves\ndrives the f-mode (fundamental mode) unstable in fast-rotating, newborn neutron\nstars. The initial growth phase of the mode is followed by its saturation,\nbecause of energy leaking to other modes of the star. The saturation point\ndetermines the strain of the generated gravitational-wave signal, which can\nthen be used to extract information about the neutron star equation of state.\nThe parent (unstable) mode couples via parametric resonances with pairs of\ndaughter modes, with the triplets' evolution exhibiting a rich variety of\nbehaviors. We study both supernova- and merger-derived neutron stars, simply\nmodeled as polytropes in a Newtonian context, and show that the parent may\ncouple to many different daughter pairs during the star's evolution through the\ninstability window, with the saturation amplitude changing by orders of\nmagnitude.\n", "  Black holes in General Relativity are very simple objects. This property,\nthat goes under the name of \"no-hair,\" has been refined in the last few decades\nand admits several versions. The simplicity of black holes makes them ideal\ntestbeds of fundamental physics and of General Relativity itself. Here we\ndiscuss the no-hair property of black holes, how it can be measured in the\nelectromagnetic or gravitational window, and what it can possibly tell us about\nour universe.\n", "  We evaluate self-interaction effects on the quantum correlations of field\nmodes of opposite momenta for scalar $\\lambda \\phi^4$ theory in a\ntwo-dimensional asymptotically flat Robertson-Walker spacetime. Such\ncorrelations are encoded both in the von-Neumann entropy defined through the\nreduced density matrix in one of the modes and in the covariance expressed in\nterms of the expectation value of the number operators for each mode in the\nevolved state. The entanglement between field modes carries information about\nthe underlying spacetime evolution.\n", "  The volume and surface components of the nuclear symmetry energy (NSE) and\ntheir ratio are calculated within the coherent density fluctuation model\n(CDFM). The estimations use the results of the model for the NSE in finite\nnuclei based on the Brueckner energy-density functional for nuclear matter. In\naddition, we present results for the NSE and its volume and surface\ncontributions obtained by using the Skyrme energy-density functional. The CDFM\nweight function is obtained using the proton and neutron densities from the\nself-consistent HF+BCS method with Skyrme interactions. We present and discuss\nthe values of the volume and surface contributions to the NSE and their ratio\nobtained for the Ni, Sn, and Pb isotopic chains studying their isotopic\nsensitivity. The results are compared with estimations of other approaches\nwhich have used available experimental data on binding energies, neutron-skin\nthicknesses, excitation energies to isobaric analog states (IAS) and also with\nresults of other theoretical methods.\n", "  Cosmic ray accelerators like supernova and hypernova remnants in star forming\ngalaxies are one of the most plausible sources of the IceCube observed diffuse\nastrophysical neutrinos. The neutrino producing hadronic processes will also\nproduce a diffuse gamma ray flux, constrained by the Fermi-LAT bounds. The fact\nthat point sources like blazars also contribute to the diffuse gamma ray flux\nimplies large gamma opacity of the neutrino sources. Indeed, for these high\nredshift star forming galaxies the gamma absorption during the intergalactic\npropagation can be significant. In addition, large gamma attenuation inside\nthese extreme source galaxies can reduce the cascade component of the diffuse\nflux. Under the current astrophysical uncertainties affecting these absorptions\nprocesses, we find the associated diffuse gamma ray flux can remain compatible\nwith the current Fermi-LAT bounds.\n", "  This paper explores the dynamics of particles in higher dimensions. For this\npurpose, we discuss some interesting features related to the motion of\nparticles near Myers-Perry black hole with arbitrary extra dimensions as well\nas single non-zero spin parameter. Assuming it as a supermassive black hole at\nthe center of galaxy, we calculate red-blue shifts in the equatorial plane for\nthe far away observer as well as corresponding black hole parameters of the\nphotons. Next, we study the Penrose process and find that the energy gain of\nparticle depends on the variation of black hole dimensions. Finally, we discuss\nthe center of mass energy for eleven dimensions which indicates similar\nbehavior as that of four dimensions but it is higher in four dimensions than\nfive or more dimensions. We conclude that higher dimensions have a great impact\non the particle dynamics.\n", "  We present exact analysis of the physical properties of bimodal networks\nspecified by the two peak degree distribution fully incorporating the\ndegree-degree correlation between node connection. The structure of the\ncorrelated bimodal network is uniquely determined by the Pearson coefficient of\nthe degree correlation, keeping its degree distribution fixed. The percolation\nthreshold and the giant component fraction of the correlated bimodal network\nare analytically calculated in the whole range of the Pearson coefficient from\n$-1$ to $1$ against two major types of node removal, which are the random\nfailure and the degree-based targeted attack. The Pearson coefficient for\nnext-nearest-neighbor pairs is also calculated, which always takes a positive\nvalue even when the correlation between nearest-neighbor pairs is negative.\nFrom the results, it is confirmed that the percolation threshold is a\nmonotonically decreasing function of the Pearson coefficient for the degrees of\nnearest-neighbor pairs increasing from $-1$ and $1$ regardless of the types of\nnode removal. In contrast, the node fraction of the giant component for bimodal\nnetworks with positive degree correlation rapidly decreases in the early stage\nof random failure, while that for bimodal networks with negative degree\ncorrelation remains relatively large until the removed node fraction reaches\nthe threshold. In this sense, bimodal networks with negative degree correlation\nare more robust against random failure than those with positive degree\ncorrelation.\n", "  Boson sampling can provide strong evidence that the computational power of a\nquantum computer outperforms a classical one via currently feasible linear\noptics experiments. However, how to identify an actual boson sampling device\nagainst any classical computing imposters is an ambiguous problem due to the\ncomputational complexity class in which boson sampling lies. The certification\nprotocol based on bosonic bunching fails to rule out the so-called mean-field\nsampling. We propose a certification scheme to distinguish the boson sampling\nfrom the mean-field sampling for any random scattering matrices chosen via the\nHarr-measure. We numerically analyze our scheme and the influence of imperfect\ninput states caused by non-simultaneous arrival photons.\n", "  The co-presence of multiple Dirac bands in few-layer graphene leads to a rich\nphase diagram in the quantum Hall regime. Using transport measurements, we map\nthe phase diagram of BN-encapsulated ABA-stacked trilayer graphene as a\nfunction charge density n, magnetic field B and interlayer displacement field\nD, and observe transitions among states with different spin, valley, orbital\nand parity polarizations. Such rich pattern arises from crossings between\nLandau levels from different subbands, which reflect the evolving symmetries\nthat are tunable in situ. At D=0, we observe fractional quantum Hall (FQH)\nstates at filling factors 2/3 and -11/3. Unlike those in bilayer graphene,\nthese FQH states are destabilized by a small interlayer potential that\nhybridizes the different Dirac bands.\n", "  The correlation between the frequency and the absolute value of the frequency\nderivative of the kilohertz QPOs observed for the first time from 4U 1636-53 is\na simple consequence and indicator of the existence of a non-Keplerian rotation\nrate in the accretion disk boundary layer. This paper interprets the observed\ncorrelation, showing that the observations provide strong evidence in support\nof the fundamental assumption of disk accretion models around slow rotators,\nthat the boundary layer matches the Keplerian disk to the neutron star\nmagnetosphere.\n", "  A snow-line is the region of a protoplanetary disk at which a major volatile,\nsuch as water or carbon monoxide, reaches its condensation temperature.\nSnow-lines play a crucial role in disk evolution by promoting the rapid growth\nof ice-covered grains. Signatures of the carbon monoxide snow-line (at\ntemperatures of around 20 kelvin) have recently been imaged in the disks\nsurrounding the pre-main-sequence stars TW Hydra and HD163296, at distances of\nabout 30 astronomical units (au) from the star. But the water snow-line of a\nprotoplanetary disk (at temperatures of more than 100 kelvin) has not hitherto\nbeen seen, as it generally lies very close to the star (less than 5 au away for\nsolar-type stars). Water-ice is important because it regulates the efficiency\nof dust and planetesimal coagulation, and the formation of comets, ice giants\nand the cores of gas giants. Here we report ALMA images at 0.03-arcsec\nresolution (12 au) of the protoplanetary disk around V883 Ori, a protostar of\n1.3 solar masses that is undergoing an outburst in luminosity arising from a\ntemporary increase in the accretion rate. We find an intensity break\ncorresponding to an abrupt change in the optical depth at about 42 au, where\nthe elevated disk temperature approaches the condensation point of water, from\nwhich we conclude that the outburst has moved the water snow-line. The spectral\nbehaviour across the snow-line confirms recent model predictions: dust\nfragmentation and the inhibition of grain growth at higher temperatures results\nin soaring grain number densities and optical depths. As most planetary systems\nare expected to experience outbursts caused by accretion during their formation\nour results imply that highly dynamical water snow-lines must be considered\nwhen developing models of disk evolution and planet formation.\n", "  So called scaling relations have the potential to reveal the mass and radius\nof solar-like oscillating stars, based on oscillation frequencies. In\nderivation of these relations, it is assumed that the first adiabatic exponent\nat the surface (Gamma_1s) of such stars is constant. However, by constructing\ninterior models for the mass range 0.8-1.6 Msun, we show that Gamma_1s is not\nconstant at stellar surfaces for the effective temperature range with which we\ndeal. Furthermore, the well-known relation between large separation and mean\ndensity also depends on Gamma_1s. Such knowledge is the basis for our aim of\nmodifying scaling relations. There are significant differences between masses\nand radii found from modified and conventional scaling relations. However,\ncomparison of predictions of these relations with the non-asteroseismic\nobservations of Procyon A reveals that new scaling relations are effective in\ndetermining the mass and radius of stars. In the present study, solar-like\noscillation frequencies of 89 target stars (mostly Kepler and CoRoT) were\nanalysed. As well as two new reference frequencies (nu_min1 and nu_min2) found\nin the spacing of solar-like oscillation frequencies of stellar interior\nmodels, we also take into account nu_min0. In addition to the frequency of\nmaximum amplitude, these frequencies have very strong diagnostic potential for\ndetermination of fundamental properties. The present study involves the\napplication of derived relations from the models to the solar-like oscillating\nstars, and computes their effective temperatures using purely asteroseismic\nmethods. There are in general very close agreements between effective\ntemperatures from asteroseismic and non-asteroseismic (spectral and\nphotometric) methods. For the Sun and Procyon A, for example, the agreement is\nalmost total.\n", "  The experimental properties of intrinsic localized modes (ILM) have long been\ncompared with theoretical dynamical lattice models that make use of nonlinear\nonsite and/or nearest neighbor intersite potentials. Here it is shown for a 1-D\nlumped electrical transmission line a nonlinear inductive component in an\notherwise linear parallel capacitor lattice makes possible a new kind of ILM\noutside the plane wave spectrum. To simplify the analysis the nonlinear\ninductive current equations are transformed to flux transmission line equations\nwith analogue onsite hard potential nonlinearities. Approximate analytic\nresults compare favorably with those obtained from a driven damped lattice\nmodel and with eigenvalue simulations. For this mono-element lattice ILMs above\nthe top of the plane wave spectrum are the result. We find that the current ILM\nis spatially compressed relative to the corresponding flux ILM. Finally this\nstudy makes the connection between the dynamics of mass and force constant\ndefects in the harmonic lattice and ILMs in a strongly anharmonic lattice.\n", "  Physical conditions that could render a core starless(in the local Universe)\nis the subject of investigation in this work. To this end we studied the\nevolution of four starless cores, B68, L694-2, L1517B, L1689, and L1521F, a\nVeLLO. The density profile of a typical core extracted from an earlier\nsimulation developed to study core-formation in a molecular cloud was used for\nthe purpose. We demonstrate - (i) cores contracted in quasistatic manner over a\ntimescale on the order of $\\sim 10^{5}$ years. Those that remained starless did\nbriefly acquire a centrally concentrated density configuration that mimicked\nthe density profile of a unstable Bonnor Ebert sphere before rebounding, (ii)\nthree of our test cores viz. L694-2, L1689-SMM16 and L1521F remained starless\ndespite becoming thermally super-critical. On the contrary B68 and L1517B\nremained sub-critical; L1521F collapsed to become a VeLLO only when gas-cooling\nwas enhanced by increasing the size of dust-grains. This result is robust, for\nother cores viz. B68, L694-2, L1517B and L1689 that previously remained\nstarless could also be similarly induced to collapse. Our principle conclusions\nare : (a) acquiring the thermally super-critical state does not ensure that a\ncore will necessarily become protostellar, (b) potentially star-forming cores\n(VeLLO L1521F here), could be experiencing coagulation of dust-grains that must\nenhance the gas-dust coupling and in turn lower the gas temperature, thereby\nassisting collapse. This hypothesis appears to have some observational support,\nand (c) depending on its dynamic state at any given epoch, a core could appear\nto be pressure-confined, gravitationally/virially bound, suggesting that\ngravitational/virial boundedness of a core is insufficient to ensure it will\nform stars, though it is crucial for gas in a contracting core to cool\nefficiently so it can collapse further to become protostellar.\n", "  A broad class of planar dielectric media with complex permittivity profiles\nthat are fully invisible, for both left and right incidence sides, is\nintroduced. Such optical media are locally isotropic, non-magnetic and belong\nto the recently discovered class of Kramers-Kronig media [{\\it Nature Photon.}\n9, 436 (2015)], i.e. the spatial profiles of the real and imaginary parts of\nthe dielectric permittivity are related each other by a Hilbert transform. The\ntransition from unidirectional to bidirectional invisibility, and the\npossibility to realize sharp reflection above a cut-off incidence angle, are\nalso discussed.\n", "  We analyze the mechanism of condensation of orientational moduli (as\nintroduced in [25]) on multi-Skyrmionic configurations of the four-dimensional\nSkyrme model. The present analysis reveals interesting novel features. First of\nall, the orientational moduli tend to decrease the repulsive interactions\nbetween Skyrmions, the effect decreasing with the increase of the Baryon\nnumber. Moreover, in the case of a single Skyrmion, the appearance of moduli is\nenergetically favorable if finite volume effects are present. Otherwise, in the\nusual flat topologically trivial case, it is not. In the low energy theory\nthese solutions can be interpreted as Skyrmions with additional isospin degrees\nof freedom.\n", "  We present a novel approach for setting initial conditions on the mode\nfunctions of the Mukhanov Sazaki equation. These conditions are motivated by\nminimisation of the renormalised stress-energy tensor, and are valid for\nsetting a vacuum state even in a context where the spacetime is changing\nrapidly. Moreover, these alternative conditions are potentially observationally\ndistinguishable. We apply this to the kinetically dominated universe, and\ncompare with the more traditional approach.\n", "  We study the influence of the magnetic field on the photon emission from the\nquark-gluon plasma created in $AA$ collisions. We find that even for very\noptimistic assumption on the magnitude of the magnetic field for noncentral\n$AA$ collisions the effect of magnetic field is very small.\n", "  We construct spatiotemporal localized envelope solutions of a\n(3+1)-dimensional nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation with varying coefficients\nsuch as dispersion, nonlinearity and gain parameters through similarity\ntransformation technique. The obtained localized rational solutions can serve\nas prototypes of rogue waves in different branches of science. We investigate\nthe characteristics of constructed localized solutions in detail when it\npropagates through six different dispersion profiles, namely constant, linear,\nGaussian, hyperbolic, logarithm and exponential. We also obtain expressions for\nthe hump and valleys of rogue wave intensity profiles for these six dispersion\nprofiles and study the trajectory of it in each case. Further, we analyze how\nthe intensity of another localized solution, namely breather, changes when it\npropagates through the aforementioned six dispersion profiles. Our studies\nreveal that these localized solutions co-exist with the collapsing solutions\nwhich are already found in the (3+1)-dimensional nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation. The obtained results will help to understand the corresponding\nlocalized wave phenomena in related fields.\n", "  Toroidal torque generated by neoclassical viscosity caused by external\nnon-resonant, non-axisymmetric perturbations has a significant influence on\ntoroidal plasma rotation in tokamaks. In this article, a derivation for the\nexpressions of toroidal torque and radial transport in resonant regimes is\nprovided within quasilinear theory in canonical action-angle variables. The\nproposed approach treats all low-collisional quasilinear resonant NTV regimes\nincluding superbanana plateau and drift-orbit resonances in a unified way and\nallows for magnetic drift in all regimes. It is valid for perturbations on\ntoroidally symmetric flux surfaces of the unperturbed equilibrium without\nspecific assumptions on geometry or aspect ratio. The resulting expressions are\nshown to match existing analytical results in the large aspect ratio limit.\nNumerical results from the newly developed code NEO-RT are compared to\ncalculations by the quasilinear version of the code NEO-2 at low\ncollisionalities. The importance of the magnetic shear term in the magnetic\ndrift frequency and a significant effect of the magnetic drift on drift-orbit\nresonances are demonstrated.\n", "  Formal but exact DC conductivity formulae for anisotropic Fermi liquids are\nreviewed. One is the Maebashi-Fukuyama formula based on the Fermi-surface\nharmonics. The other is the Taylor formula based on the scattering\neigenfunction. In comparison to these two formulae the\ncurrent-vertex-correction in the fluctuation-exchange approximation is shown to\nbe a bad vision caused by an inconsistent approximation.\n", "  Most density functionals have been developed by imposing the known exact\nconstraints on the exchange-correlation energy, or by a fit to a set of\nproperties of selected systems, or by both. However, accurate modeling of the\nconventional exchange hole presents a great challenge, due to the\ndelocalization of the hole. Making use of the property that the hole can be\nmade localized under a general coordinate transformation, here we derive an\nexchange hole from the density matrix expansion, while the correlation part is\nobtained by imposing the low-density limit constraint. From the hole, a\nsemilocal exchange-correlation functional is calculated. Our comprehensive test\nshows that this functional can achieve remarkable accuracy for diverse\nproperties of molecules, solids and solid surfaces, substantially improving\nupon the nonempirical functionals proposed in recent years. Accurate semilocal\nfunctionals based on their associated holes are physically appealing and\npractically useful for developing nonlocal functionals.\n", "  Inelastic neutron scattering experiments have been carried out to determine\nthe crystal field states of the Kondo lattice heavy fermions CeRuSn3 and\nCeRhSn3. Both the compounds crystallize in LaRuSn3-type cubic structure (space\ngroup Pm-3n) in which the Ce atoms occupy two distinct crystallographic sites\nwith cubic (m-3) and tetragonal (-4m.2) point symmetries. The INS data of\nCeRuSn3 reveal the presence of a broad excitation centered around 6-8 meV which\nis accounted by a model based on crystal electric field (CEF) excitations. On\nthe other hand, the INS data of isostructural CeRhSn3 reveal three CEF\nexcitations around 7.0, 12.2 and 37.2 meV. The neutron intensity sum rule\nindicates that the Ce ions at both cubic and tetragonal Ce sites are in Ce3+\nstate in both CeRuSn3 and CeRhSn3. The CEF level schemes for both the compounds\nare deduced. We estimate the Kondo temperature T_K = 3.1(2) K for CeRuSn3 from\nneutron quasielastic linewidth in excellent agreement with that determined from\nthe scaling of magnetoresistance which gives T_K = 3.2(1) K. For CeRhSn3 the\nneutron quasielastic linewidth gives T_K = 4.6 K. For both CeRuSn3 and CeRhSn3,\nthe ground state of Ce3+ turns out to be a quartet for the cubic site and a\ndoublet for the tetragonal site.\n", "  We investigate the influence of confinement on the positional order of a\nquasi-1D electron system trapped on the surface of liquid helium. We find\nevidence that the melting of the Wigner solid (WS) depends on the confinement\nstrength, as well as electron density and temperature. A reentrant\nsolid-liquid-solid transition is observed for increasing electron density under\nconstant electrostatic confinement. As the electron row number $N_y$ changes,\nvarying commensurability results in a modulation of the WS order, even when\n$N_y$ is large (several tens). This is confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations.\n", "  We report investigations of molybdenum nitride (MoN) thin films with\ndifferent thickness and disorder and with superconducting transition\ntemperature 9.89 K $\\ge{T_c}\\ge$ 2.78 K. Using terahertz frequency-domain\nspectroscopy we explore the normal and superconducting charge carrier dynamics\nfor frequencies covering the range from 3 to 38 cm$^{-1}$ (0.1 to 1.1 THz). The\nsuperconducting energy scales, i.e. the critical temperature $T_c$, the pairing\nenergy $\\Delta$, and the superfluid stiffness $J$, and the superfluid density\n$n_s$ can be well described within the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory for\nconventional superconductors. At the same time, we find an anomalously large\ndissipative conductivity, which cannot be explained by thermally excited\nquasiparticles, but rather by a temperature-dependent normal-conducting\nfraction, persisting deep into the superconducting state. Our results on this\ndisordered system constrain the regime, where discernible effects stemming from\nthe disorder-induced superconductor-insulator transition possibly become\nrelevant, to MoN films with a transition temperature lower than at least 2.78\nK.\n", "  It is well known that in perturbation theory existence of quasi-degenerate\nstates can rearrange the order counting. For a heavy quarkonium system,\nnaively, enhanced effects ($l$-changing mixing effects) could contribute\nalready to the first-order and third-order corrections to the wave function and\nthe energy level, respectively, in expansion in $\\alpha_s$. We present a\nformulation and note that the corresponding (lowest-order) corrections vanish\ndue to absence of the relevant off-diagonal matrix elements. As a result, in\nthe quarkonium energy level and leptonic decay width, the enhanced effects are\nexpected to appear, respectively, in the fifth- and fourth-order corrections\nand beyond.\n", "  We investigate magnetic reconnection in systems simultaneously containing\nasymmetric (anti-parallel) magnetic fields, asymmetric plasma densities and\ntemperatures, and arbitrary in-plane bulk flow of plasma in the upstream\nregions. Such configurations are common in the high-latitudes of Earth's\nmagnetopause and in tokamaks. We investigate the convection speed of the\nX-line, the scaling of the reconnection rate, and the condition for which the\nflow suppresses reconnection as a function of upstream flow speeds. We use\ntwo-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations to capture the mixing of plasma in\nthe outflow regions better than is possible in fluid modeling. We perform\nsimulations with asymmetric magnetic fields, simulations with asymmetric\ndensities, and simulations with magnetopause-like parameters where both are\nasymmetric. For flow speeds below the predicted cutoff velocity, we find good\nscaling agreement with the theory presented in Doss et al., J.~Geophys.~Res.,\n120, 7748 (2015). Applications to planetary magnetospheres, tokamaks, and the\nsolar wind are discussed.\n", "  This work focuses on gluon(jet) production in dilute(proton)-dense(nucleus)\ncollisions. Depending on the frame and gauge, gluon production can be viewed as\na freeing of gluons coming from either the proton wave function or from the\nnucleus wave function. These (apparently) very different pictures must lead to\nthe same result and the purpose of this paper is to see how that happens. The\nfocus is on gluons having $k_\\perp\\sim Q_S$ or gluons in the scaling region\n$k_\\perp/Q_S\\gg 1$. In the McLerran-Venugopalan(MV) model with $k_\\perp\\sim\nQ_S$ we are able to derive gluon production in a way that (graphically)\nmanifestly shows $k_\\perp$-factorization in terms of the number density of\ngluons in the nuclear wave function. We presume that this picture, and\n$k_\\perp$-factorization, continues to hold in the presence of small-$x$\nevolution although we have not been able to explicitly verify this. Our result\nis in agreement with usual $k_\\perp$-factorization where the gluon number\ndensity of the nucleus does not appear in an explicit way.\n", "  We discuss the possibility that a Born-Infeld condensate coupled to neutrinos\ncan generate both neutrino masses and an effective cosmological constant. In\nparticular, an effective field theory is provided capable of dynamically\nrealizing the neutrino superfluid phase firstly suggested by Ginzburg and\nZharkov. In such a case, neutrinos acquire a mass gap inside the Born-Infeld\nether forming a long-range Cooper pair. Phenomenological implications of the\napproach are also discussed.\n", "  The optical spectra of Seyfert galaxies are often dominated by emission lines\nexcited by both star formation and AGN activity. Standard calibrations (such as\nfor the star formation rate) are not applicable to such composite (mixed)\nspectra. In this paper, we describe how integral field data can be used to\nspectrally and spatially separate emission associated with star formation from\nemission associated with accretion onto an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We\ndemonstrate our method using integral field data for two AGN host galaxies (NGC\n5728 and NGC 7679) from the Siding Spring Southern Seyfert Spectroscopic\nSnapshot Survey (S7). The spectra of NGC 5728 and NGC 7679 form clear sequences\nof AGN fraction on standard emission line ratio diagnostic diagrams. We show\nthat the emission line luminosities of the majority (> 85 per cent) of spectra\nalong each AGN fraction sequence can be reproduced by linear superpositions of\nthe emission line luminosities of one AGN dominated spectrum and one star\nformation dominated spectrum. We separate the Halpha, Hbeta, [N\nII]$\\lambda$6583, [S II]$\\lambda \\lambda$6716, 6731, [O III]$\\lambda$5007 and\n[O II]$\\lambda \\lambda$3726, 3729 luminosities of every spaxel into\ncontributions from star formation and AGN activity. The decomposed emission\nline images are used to derive the star formation rates and AGN bolometric\nluminosities for NGC 5728 and NGC 7679. Our calculated values are mostly\nconsistent with independent estimates from data at other wavelengths. The\nrecovered star forming and AGN components also have distinct spatial\ndistributions which trace structures seen in high resolution imaging of the\ngalaxies, providing independent confirmation that our decomposition has been\nsuccessful.\n", "  The spin-orbit coupling in the absence of spatial inversion symmetry plays an\nimportant role in realizing intriguing electronic states in solids, such as\ntopological insulators and unconventional superconductivity. Usually, the\ninversion symmetry breaking is inherent in the lattice structures, and hence,\nit is not easy to control these interesting properties by external parameters.\nWe here theoretically investigate the possibility of generating the\nspin-orbital entanglement by spontaneous electronic ordering caused by electron\ncorrelations. In particular, we focus on the centrosymmetric lattices with\nlocal asymmetry at the lattice sites, e.g., zig-zag, honeycomb, and diamond\nstructures. In such systems, conventional staggered orders, such as charge\norder and antiferromagnetic order, break the inversion symmetry and activate\nthe antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling, which is hidden in a\nsublattice-dependent form in the paramagnetic state. Considering a minimal\ntwo-orbital model on a honeycomb lattice, we scrutinize the explicit form of\nthe antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling for all the possible staggered charge,\nspin, orbital, and spin-orbital orders. We show that the complete table is\nuseful for understanding of spin-valley-orbital physics, such as spin and\nvalley splitting in the electronic band structure and generalized\nmagnetoelectric responses in not only spin but also orbital and spin-orbital\nchannels, reflecting in peculiar magnetic, elastic, and optical properties in\nsolids.\n", "  A new theory is developed to describe the equilibrium adsorption and\nself-assembly of patchy colloids in microchannels. The adsorption theory is\ndeveloped in classical density functional theory, with the adsorbed phase and\nfluid phase modeled using thermodynamic perturbation theory. In this work we\npropose that the introduction of patches on the colloids greatly enhances the\ntemperature dependent and reversible adsorption of colloids in microchannels.\nIt is shown how bulk fluid density, patch size, temperature and channel\ndiameter can be manipulated to achieve the adsorption and self-assembly of\npatchy colloids in microchannels.\n", "  This work presents theoretical demonstration of a carrier trap unit formed by\ndual topological insulator constrictions (TIC) on the HgTe/CdTe quantum well\n(QW) with inverted band structures. The sample of HgTe/CdTe QW is patterned\ninto a Hall bar device and a topological quantum dot is created by adding split\ngate electrodes closely on the QW. In sharp contrast to conventional\nsemiconductor quantum dots, the presence or absence of topological edge states\nin the proposed quantum hall bar system leads to distinct\npropagating/insulating state of the TICs with large on/off ratio. This\ntopological quantum dot functions as a carrier trap memory element with near\nperfect program/erase efficiency by proper adjusting the voltages applied to\nthe split gates. For completeness, we also demonstrate that the Rashba spin\norbit interaction in the quantum dot does not destroy the topological edge\nstates and have negligible impact on the conductance of the quantum hall bar.\nThe rapid oscillations in conductance can be suppressed when applying a\nperpendicular magnetic field in the quantum dot.\n", "  We study dynamic two-body correlation functions, i.e. the two-body density,\nthe current-density correlator or van Hove current, and the current-current\ncorrelator in Brownian dynamics computer simulations of a dense Lennard-Jones\nbulk liquid. The dynamic decay of the correlation shells of the two-body\ndensity is examined in detail. Inner correlation shells decay faster than outer\ncorrelation shells, whereas outer correlation shells remain stable for\nincreasing times. Within a dynamic test particle picture the mechanism is\nassumed to be triggered by the dislocation of the self particle, which releases\nthe confinement of the surrounding correlation shells. We present a division of\nthe van Hove current into an adiabatic and a superadiabatic contribution. The\nmagnitude of the adiabatic van Hove current is found to exceed that of the\ntotal van Hove current, which is consistent with dynamic density functional\ntheory overestimating the speed of the dynamics. The direction of the\nsuperadiabatic van Hove current opposes that of the total van Hove current. The\ncurrent-current correlator reveals detailed insight in the collisions of the\nparticles. We find a large static nearest-neighbor peak, which results from\ncolliding particles and different dynamic peaks, that are attributed to\nconsecutive collisions.\n", "  The Vlasov formalism is extended to relativistic mean-field hadron models\nwith non-linear terms up to fourth order and applied to the calculation of the\ncrust-core transition density. The effect of the nonlinear $\\omega\\rho$ and\n$\\sigma\\rho$ coupling terms on the crust-core transition density and pressure,\nand on the macroscopic properties of some families of hadronic stars is\ninvestigated. For that purpose, six families of relativistic mean field models\nare considered. Within each family, the members differ in the symmetry energy\nbehavior. For all the models, the dynamical spinodals are calculated, and the\ncrust-core transition density and pressure, and the neutron star mass-radius\nrelations are obtained. The effect on the star radius of the inclusion of a\npasta calculation in the inner crust is discussed. The set of six models that\nbest satisfy terrestrial and observational constraints predicts a radius of\n13.6$\\pm$0.3 km and a crust thickness of $1.36\\pm 0.06$km for a 1.4 $M_\\odot$\nstar.\n", "  We present truly ultimate limits on covert quantum communication by\nexploiting quantum-mechanical properties of the Minkowski vacuum in the quantum\nfield theory framework. Our main results are the following: We show how two\nparties equipped with Unruh-DeWitt detectors can covertly communicate at large\ndistances without the need of hiding in a thermal background or relying on\nvarious technological tricks. We reinstate the information-theoretic security\nstandards for reliability of asymptotic quantum communication and show that the\nrate of covert communication is strictly positive. Therefore, contrary to the\nprevious conclusions, covert and reliable quantum communication is possible.\n", "  We stabilize a chip-scale Si3N4 phase-locked Kerr frequency comb via locking\nthe pump laser to an independent stable high-Q reference microresonator and\nlocking the comb spacing to an external microwave oscillator. In this comb, the\npump laser shift induces negligible impact on the comb spacing change. This\nscheme is a step towards miniaturization of the stabilized Kerr comb system as\nthe microresonator reference can potentially be integrated on-chip. Fractional\ninstability of the optical harmonics of the stabilized comb is limited by the\nmicrowave oscillator used for comb spacing lock below 1 s averaging time and\ncoincides with the pump laser drift in the long term.\n", "  We study an unconventional quantum Hall effect for the surface states of\nultrathin Floquet topological insulators in a perpendicular magnetic field. The\nresulting band structure is modified by photon dressing and the topological\nproperty is governed by the low-energy dynamics of a single surface. An\nexchange of symmetric and antisymmetric surface states occurs by reversing the\nlight's polarization. We find a novel quantum Hall state in which the zeroth\nLandau level undergoes a phase transition from a trivial insulator state, with\nHall conductivity $\\sigma_{yx}=0$ at zero Fermi energy, to a Hall insulator\nstate with $\\sigma_{yx}=e^2/2h$. These findings open new possibilities for\nexperimentally realizing nontrivial quantum states and unusual quantum Hall\nplateaux at $(\\pm1/2,\\pm3/2,\\pm5/2,...)e^2/h$.\n", "  The derivation of the time dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation with transversal\nand longitudinal relaxation, as the quantum mechanical analog of the classical\nLandau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation, has been described. Starting from the classical\nLandau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation the transition to quantum mechanics has been\nperformed and the corresponding von-Neumann equation deduced. In a second step\nthe time Schr\\\"odinger equation has been derived. Analytical proofs and\ncomputer simulations show the correctness and applicability of the derived\nSchr\\\"odinger equation.\n", "  The study of high energy collisions between heavy nuclei is a field unto\nitself, distinct from nuclear and particle physics. A defining aspect of heavy\nion physics is the importance of a bulk, self-interacting system with a rich\nspace-time substructure. I focus on the issue of timescales in heavy ion\ncollisions, starting with proof from low-energy collisions that femtoscopy can,\nindeed, measure very long timescales. I then discuss the relativistic case,\nwhere detailed measurements over three orders of magnitude in energy reveal a\ntimescale increase that might be due to a first-order phase transition. I\ndiscuss also consistency in evolution timescales as determined from traditional\nlongitudinal sizes and a novel analysis using shape information.\n", "  The aggregation dynamics of slime mold is studied using coupled equations of\nphase \\phi and cell concentration n. Phase waves work as tactic signals for\naggregation. Branching structures appear during the aggregation. A stationary\nbranching pattern appears like a river network, if cells are uniformly supplied\ninto the system.\n", "  In the high-energy domain, gluon transverse-momentum dependent distributions\nin nuclei obey constraints coming from positivity and unitarity of the\ncolorless QCD dipole distributions through Fourier-Bessel transformations.\nUsing mathematical properties of Fourier-positive functions, we investigate the\nnature of these constraints which apply to dipole model building and\nformulation\n", "  We present thermoelectric power and resistivity measurements in the\nferromagnetic superconductor URhGe for magnetic field applied along the hard\nmagnetization b axis of the orthorhombic crystal. Reentrant superconductivity\nis observed near the the spin reorientation transition at $H_{R}$=12.75 T,\nwhere a first order transition from the ferromagnetic to the polarized\nparamagnetic state occurs. Special focus is given to the longitudinal\nconfiguration, where both electric and heat current are parallel to the applied\nfield. The validity of the Fermi-liquid $T^2$ dependence of the resistivity\nthrough $H_R$ demonstrates clearly that no quantum critical point occurs at\n$H_R$. Thus the ferromagnetic transition line at $H_R$ becomes first order\nimplying the existence of a tricritical point at finite temperature. The\nenhancement of magnetic fluctuations in the vicinity of the tricritical point\nstimulates the reentrance of superconductivity. The abrupt sign change observed\nin the thermoelectric power with the thermal gradient applied along the b axis\ntogether with the strong anomalies in the other directions is a definitive\nmacroscopic evidence that in addition a significant change of the Fermi surface\nappears through $H_R$.\n", "  PARAS is a fiber-fed stabilized high-resolution cross-dispersed echelle\nspectrograph, located on the 1.2 m telescope in Mt. Abu India. Designed for\nexoplanet detection, PARAS is capable of single-shot spectral coverage of 3800\n- 9600 A, and currently achieving radial velocity (RV) precisions approaching\n~1 m/s over several months using simultaneous ThAr calibration. As such, it is\none of the few dedicated stabilized fiber-fed spectrographs on small (1-2 m)\ntelescopes that are able to fill an important niche in RV follow-up and stellar\ncharacterization. The success of ground-based RV surveys is motivating the push\ninto extreme precisions, with goals of ~10 cm/s in the optical and <1 m/s in\nthe near-infrared (NIR). Lessons from existing instruments like PARAS are\ninvaluable in informing hardware design, providing pipeline prototypes, and\nguiding scientific surveys. Here we present our current precision estimates of\nPARAS based on observations of bright RV standard stars, and describe the\nevolution of the data reduction and RV analysis pipeline as instrument\ncharacterization progresses and we gather longer baselines of data. Secondly,\nwe discuss how our experience with PARAS is a critical component in the\ndevelopment of future cutting edge instruments like (1) the Habitable Zone\nPlanet Finder (HPF), a NIR spectrograph optimized to look for planets around M\ndwarfs, scheduled to be commissioned on the Hobby Eberly Telescope in 2017, and\n(2) the NEID optical spectrograph, designed in response to the NN-EXPLORE call\nfor an extreme precision Doppler spectrometer (EPDS) for the WIYN telescope. In\nanticipation of instruments like TESS and GAIA, the ground-based RV support\nsystem is being reinforced. We emphasize that instruments like PARAS will play\nan intrinsic role in providing both complementary follow-up and battlefront\nexperience for these next generation of precision velocimeters.\n", "  Relativistic self-consistent mean-field (SCMF) models naturally account for\nthe coupling of the nucleon spin to its orbital motion, whereas\nnon-relativistic SCMF methods necessitate a phenomenological ansatz for the\neffective spin-orbit potential. Recent experimental studies aim to explore the\nisospin properties of the effective spin-orbit interaction in nuclei. SCMF\nmodels are very useful in the interpretation of the corresponding data, however\nstandard relativistic mean-field and non-relativistic Hartree-Fock models use\neffective spin-orbit potentials with different isovector properties, mainly\nbecause exchange contributions are not treated explicitly in the former. The\nimpact of exchange terms on the effective spin-orbit potential in relativistic\nmean-field models is analysed, and it is shown that it leads to an isovector\nstructure similar to the one used in standard non-relativistic Hartree-Fock.\nData on the isospin dependence of spin-orbit splittings in spherical nuclei\ncould be used to constrain the isovector-scalar channel of relativistic\nmean-field models. The reproduction of the empirical kink in the isotope shifts\nof even Pb nuclei by relativistic effective interactions points to the\noccurrence of pseudospin symmetry in the single-neutron spectra in these\nnuclei.\n", "  In this contribution we will discuss how the study of various fluctuation\nobservables may be used to explore the phase diagram of the strong interaction.\nWe will briefly summarize the present study of experimental and theoretical\nresearch in this area. We will then discuss various corrections and issues\nwhich need to be understood and applied for a meaningful comparison of\nexperimental measurements with theoretical predictions. This contribution is\ndedicated to Andrzej Bialas on the occasion of his $80^{\\mathrm{th}}$ birthday.\n", "  One of the central issues in High Energy Physics is the close interchange\nbetween Theory and Experiment. Ever since I know Andrzej Bia{\\l}as, I know him\nas one of the theorists most interested in experimental data. This has\nnaturally led to continuous fruitful contacts. Even though we have been working\nsomehow together since about 1968, we so far have only one single publication\nin common. This was back in 1969 and it was on means to efficiently study what\nwe then called (exclusive) Multihadron Final States. At that time this meant 3-\nor at best 4-particle final states of two-hadron collisions at cms energies of\nsome 4 GeV (not TeV!). The field of multiparticle dynamics was in fact the\ndomain of Polish high-energy physicists. The first of a very successful (and\nstill lasting) series of annual International Symposia on Multiparticle\nDynamics was organized in Paris in 1970, but essentially by Polish physicists.\nAndrzej himself was not attending, but it was he who organized the third in\nthese series in (of course) Zakopane. Since heavy ion-collisions, another field\nof major interest for Andrzej, will be covered by others, I here will restrict\nmyself mainly to the collisions of two elementary particles.\n", "  We investigate puncture statistics based on the covariant area spectrum in\nloop quantum gravity. First, we consider Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics with a\nGibbs factor for punctures. We establish formulae which relate physical\nquantities such as horizon area to the parameter characterizing holographic\ndegrees of freedom. We also perform numerical calculations and obtain\nconsistency with these formulae. These results tell us that the holographic\nbound is satisfied in the large area limit and correction term of the\nentropy-area law can be proportional to the logarithm of the horizon area.\nSecond, we also consider Bose-Einstein statistics and show that the above\nformulae are also useful in this case. By applying the formulae, we can\nunderstand intrinsic features of Bose-Einstein condensate which corresponds to\nthe case when the horizon area almost consists of punctures in the ground\nstate. When this phenomena occurs, the area is approximately constant against\nthe parameter characterizing the temperature. When this phenomena is broken,\nthe area shows rapid increase which suggests the phase transition from quantum\nto classical area.\n", "  We intercalate a van der Waals heterostructure of graphene and hexagonal\nBoron Nitride with Au, by encapsulation, and show that Au at the interface is\ntwo dimensional. A charge transfer upon current annealing indicates\nredistribution of Au and induces splitting of the graphene bandstructure. The\neffect of in plane magnetic field confirms that splitting is due to\nspin-splitting and that spin polarization is in the plane, characteristic of a\nRashba interaction with magnitude approximately 25 meV. Consistent with the\npresence of intrinsic interfacial electric field we show that the splitting can\nbe enhanced by an applied displacement field in dual gated samples. Giant\nnegative magnetoresistance, up to 75%, and a field induced anomalous Hall\neffect at magnetic fields < 1 T are observed. These demonstrate that hybridized\nAu has a magnetic moment and suggests the proximity to formation of a\ncollective magnetic phase. These effects persist close to room temperature.\n", "  A non-Gaussian state being a mixture of the vacuum and single-photon states\ncan be generated by truncating a thermal state in a quantum scissors device of\nPegg et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 81 (1998) 1604]. In contrast to the thermal\nstate, the generated state shows nonclassical property including the negativity\nof Wigner function. Besides, signal amplification and signal-to-noise ratio\nenhancement can be achieved.\n", "  The proposed Satellite Test of the Equivalence Principle (STEP) will detect\npossible violations of the Weak Equivalence Principle by measuring relative\naccelerations between test masses of different composition with a precision of\none part in $10^{18}$. A serendipitous byproduct of the experimental design is\nthat the absolute (common-mode) acceleration of the test masses is also\nmeasured to high precision as they oscillate along a common axis under the\ninfluence of restoring forces produced by the position sensor currents, which\nin drag-free mode lead to Newtonian accelerations as small as $10^{-14}$ g.\nThis is deep inside the low-acceleration regime where Modified Newtonian\nDynamics (MOND) diverges strongly from the Newtonian limit of General\nRelativity. We show that MOND theories (including those based on the\nwidely-used $n$-family of interpolating functions as well as the covariant\nTensor-Vector-Scalar formulation) predict an easily detectable increase in the\nfrequency of oscillations of the STEP test masses if the Strong Equivalence\nPrinciple holds. If it does not hold, MOND predicts a cumulative increase in\noscillation amplitude which is also detectable. STEP thus provides a new and\npotentially decisive test of Newton's law of inertia, as well as the\nequivalence principle in both its strong and weak forms.\n", "  The high-spin states in 153Ho, have been studied by 139 57 La(20Ne, 6n)\nreaction at a projectile energy of 139 MeV at Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre\n(VECC), Kolkata, India, utilizing an earlier campaign of Indian National Gamma\nArray (INGA) setup. Data from gamma-gamma coincidence, directional correlation\nand polarization measurements have been analyzed to assign and confirm the\nspins and parities of the levels. We have suggested a few additions and\nrevisions of the reported level scheme of 153Ho. The RF-gamma time difference\nspectra have been useful to confirm the half-life of an isomer in this nucleus.\nFrom the comparison of experimental and theoretical results, it is found that\nthere are definite indications of shape coexistence in this nucleus. The\nexperimental and calculated lifetimes of several isomers have been compared to\nfollow the coexistence and evolution of shape with increasing spin.\n", "  Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP) are often observed in X-ray emission from\nsolar flares. To date, it is unclear what their physical origins are. Here, we\npresent a multi-instrument investigation of the nature of QPP during the\nimpulsive and decay phases of the X1.0 flare of 28 October 2013. We focus on\nthe character of the fine structure pulsations evident in the soft X-ray time\nderivatives and compare this variability with structure across multiple\nwavelengths including hard X-ray and microwave emission. We find that during\nthe impulsive phase of the flare, high correlations between pulsations in the\nthermal and non-thermal emissions are seen. A characteristic timescale of ~20s\nis observed in all channels and a second timescale of ~55s is observed in the\nnon-thermal emissions. Soft X-ray pulsations are seen to persist into the decay\nphase of this flare, up to 20 minutes after the non-thermal emission has\nceased. We find that these decay phase thermal pulsations have very small\namplitude and show an increase in characteristic timescale from ~40s up to\n~70s. We interpret the bursty nature of the co-existing multi-wavelength QPP\nduring the impulsive phase in terms of episodic particle acceleration and\nplasma heating. The persistent thermal decay phase QPP are most likely\nconnected with compressive MHD processes in the post-flare loops such as the\nfast sausage mode or the vertical kink mode.\n", "  Basing on the analogue Landau levels for a neutral particle possessing an\ninduced electric dipole moment, we show that displaced states can be built in\nthe presence of electric and magnetic fields. Besides, the Berry phase\nassociated with these displaced quantum states is obtained by performing an\nadiabatic cyclic evolution in series of paths in parameter space.\n", "  The $\\vec{k}.\\vec{p}$ perturbation theory in semiconductor modifies some spin\nrelated parameters of the semi-conducting system. Furthermore, renormalization\nof the Kane model parameters occurs when temperature appears in the scenario.\nIn this paper, we have analysed the consequences of this renormalized Kane\nparameters on some spin transport issues. It is noteworthy to study that the\ntemperature corrected scenario, explained here can open up a new direction\ntowards the spin calorimetric applications in semiconductors.\n", "  We extend the scalar-tensor reconstruction techniques for classical cosmology\nframeworks, in the context of loop quantum cosmology. After presenting in some\ndetail how the equations are generalized in the loop quantum cosmology case, we\ndiscuss which new features and limitations does the quantum framework brings\nalong, and we use various illustrative examples in order to demonstrate how the\nmethod works. As we show the energy density has two different classes of\nsolutions, and one of these yields the correct classical limit while the second\ncaptures the quantum phenomena. We study in detail the scalar tensor\nreconstruction method for both these solutions. Also we discuss some scenarios\nfor which the Hubble rate becomes unbounded at finite time, which corresponds\nfor example in a case that a Big Rip occurs. As we show this issue is\nnon-trivial and we discuss how this case should be treated in a consistent way.\nFinally, we investigate how the classical stability conditions for the\nscalar-tensor solutions are generalized in the loop quantum framework.\n", "  We applied a method of compressed sensing to the observation of\nquasi-particle interference (QPI) by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy\nto improve efficiency and save measurement time. To solve an ill-posed problem\nowing to the scarcity of data, the compressed sensing utilizes the sparseness\nof QPI patterns in momentum space. We examined the performance of a\nsparsity-inducing algorithm called least absolute shrinkage and selection\noperator (LASSO), and demonstrated that LASSO enables us to recover a\ndouble-circle QPI pattern of the Ag(111) surface from a dataset whose size is\nless than that necessary for the conventional Fourier transformation method. In\naddition, the smallest number of data required for the recovery is discussed on\nthe basis of cross validation.\n", "  Premelting of ice within pores in earth materials is shown to depend on the\npresence of vapor layers. For thick vapor layers between ice and pore surfaces,\na nanosized water sheet can be formed due to repulsive Lifshitz forces. In the\nabsence of vapor layers, ice is inhibited from melting near pore surfaces. In\nbetween these limits, we find an enhancement of the water film thickness in\nsilica and alumina pores. In the presence of metallic surface patches in the\npore, the Lifshitz forces can dramatically widen the water film thickness, with\npotential complete melting of the ice surface.\n", "  For a Weibel shock to form, two plasma shells have to collide and trigger the\nWeibel instability. At saturation, this instability generates in the\noverlapping region magnetic filaments with peak field $B_f$. In the absence of\nan external guiding magnetic field, these filaments can block the incoming\nflow, initiating the shock formation, if their size is larger than the Larmor\nradius of the incoming particles in the peak field. Here we show that this\nresults still holds in the presence of an external magnetic field $B_0$,\nprovided it is not too high. Yet, for $B_0 \\gtrsim B_f/2$, the filaments become\nunable to stop any particle, regardless of its initially velocity.\n", "  Turbulence profoundly affects particle transport and plasma heating in many\nastrophysical plasma environments, from galaxy clusters to the solar corona and\nsolar wind to Earth's magnetosphere. Both fluid and kinetic simulations of\nplasma turbulence ubiquitously generate coherent structures, in the form of\ncurrent sheets, at small scales, and the locations of these current sheets\nappear to be associated with enhanced rates of dissipation of the turbulent\nenergy. Therefore, illuminating the origin and nature of these current sheets\nis critical to identifying the dominant physical mechanisms of dissipation, a\nprimary aim at the forefront of plasma turbulence research. Here we present\nevidence from nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations that strong nonlinear\ninteractions between counterpropagating Alfven waves, or strong Alfven wave\ncollisions, are a natural mechanism for the generation of current sheets in\nplasma turbulence. Furthermore, we conceptually explain this current sheet\ndevelopment in terms of the nonlinear dynamics of Alfven wave collisions,\nshowing that these current sheets arise through constructive interference among\nthe initial Alfven waves and nonlinearly generated modes. The properties of\ncurrent sheets generated by a strong Alfven wave collisions are compared to\npublished observations of current sheets in the Earth's magnetosheath and the\nsolar wind, and the nature of these current sheets leads to the expectation\nthat Landau damping of the constituent Alfven waves plays a dominant role in\nthe damping of turbulently generated current sheets.\n", "  Virtually, all existing theoretical works on turbulent poloidal momentum\ntransport are based on quasilinear theory. Nonlinear poloidal momentum flux -\n$\\langle \\tilde{v}_r \\tilde{n} \\tilde{v}_{\\theta} \\rangle$ is universally\nneglected. However, in the strong turbulence regime where relative fluctuation\namplitude is no longer small, quasilinear theory is invalid. This is true at\nthe all-important plasma edge. In this work, nonlinear poloidal momentum flux $\n\\langle \\tilde{v}_r \\tilde{n} \\tilde{v}_{\\theta} \\rangle $ in strong\nelectrostatic turbulence is calculated using Hasegawa-Mima equation, and is\ncompared with quasilinear poloidal Reynolds stress. A novel property is that\nsymmetry breaking in fluctuation spectrum is not necessary for a nonlinear\npoloidal momentum flux. This is fundamentally different from the quasilinear\nReynold stress. Furthermore, the comparison implies that the poloidal rotation\ndrive from the radial gradient of nonlinear momentum flux is comparable to that\nfrom the quasilinear Reynolds force. Nonlinear poloidal momentum transport in\nstrong electrostatic turbulence is thus not negligible for poloidal rotation\ndrive, and so may be significant to transport barrier formation.\n", "  Crystal plasticity occurs by deformation bursts due to the avalanche-like\nmotion of dislocations. Here we perform extensive numerical simulations of a\nthree-dimensional dislocation dynamics model under quasistatic\nstress-controlled loading. Our results show that avalanches are power-law\ndistributed, and display peculiar stress and sample size dependence: The\naverage avalanche size grows exponentially with the applied stress, and the\namount of slip increases with the system size. These results suggest that\nintermittent deformation processes in crystalline materials exhibit an extended\ncritical-like phase in analogy to glassy systems, instead of originating from a\nnon-equilibrium phase transition critical point.\n", "  In the paper we present a low cost optical device which splits the light in\nthe focal plane into two separate optical paths and collimates it back into a\nsingle image plane, and where a selective information processing ca be carried\nout. The optical system is straightforward and easy implementable as it\nconsists of only three lens and two mirrors. The system is dedicated for\nimaging in low-light-level conditions in which widely used optical devices,\nbased on beam-splitters or dichroic mirrors, suffer from light loss. We expose\nexamples of applications of our device, using a prototype model. The proposed\noptical system may be employed for: monitoring the objects located in different\ndistances from observer (1), creating regions of different magnification within\na single image plane (2), high dynamic range photometry (3), or imaging in two\nwavelength bands simultaneously (4).\n", "  We review recent progress in the lattice investigations of near-conformal\nnon-abelian gauge theories relevant for dynamical symmetry breaking and model\nbuilding of composite Higgs models. The emphasis is placed on the mass spectrum\nand the running renormalized coupling. The role of a light composite scalar\nisosinglet particle as a composite Higgs particle is highlighted.\n", "  We report a neutron spin-echo study of the critical dynamics in the $S=5/2$\nantiferromagnets MnF$_2$ and Rb$_2$MnF$_4$ with three-dimensional (3D) and\ntwo-dimensional (2D) spin systems, respectively, in zero external field. Both\ncompounds are Heisenberg antiferromagnets with a small uniaxial anisotropy\nresulting from dipolar spin-spin interactions, which leads to a crossover in\nthe critical dynamics close to the N\\'eel temperature, $T_N$. By taking\nadvantage of the $\\mu\\text{eV}$ energy resolution of the spin-echo\nspectrometer, we have determined the dynamical critical exponents $z$ for both\nlongitudinal and transverse fluctuations. In MnF$_2$, both the characteristic\ntemperature for crossover from 3D Heisenberg to 3D Ising behavior and the\nexponents $z$ in both regimes are consistent with predictions from the\ndynamical scaling theory. The amplitude ratio of longitudinal and transverse\nfluctuations also agrees with predictions. In Rb$_2$MnF$_4$, the critical\ndynamics crosses over from the expected 2D Heisenberg behavior for $T\\gg T_N$\nto a scaling regime with exponent $z = 1.387(4)$, which has not been predicted\nby theory and may indicate the influence of long-range dipolar interactions.\n", "  Neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) gas in interstellar space is largely organized\ninto filaments, loops, and shells, the most prominent of which are\n\"supershells\". These gigantic structures requiring $\\gtrsim 3 \\times 10^{52}$\nerg to form are generally thought to be produced by either the explosion of\nmultiple supernovae (SNe) in OB associations or alternatively by the impact of\nhigh-velocity clouds (HVCs) falling to the Galactic disk. Here we report the\ndetection of a kiloparsec (kpc)-size supershell in the outskirts of the Milky\nWay with the compact HVC 040+01$-$282 (hereafter CHVC040) at its geometrical\ncenter using the \"Inner-Galaxy Arecibo L-band Feed Array\" HI 21-cm survey data.\nThe morphological and physical properties of both objects suggest that CHVC040,\nwhich is either a fragment of a nearby disrupted galaxy or a cloud originated\nfrom an intergalactic accreting flow, collided with the disk $\\sim 5$ Myrs ago\nto form the supershell. Our result shows that some compact HVCs can survive\ntheir trip through the Galactic halo and inject energy and momentum into the\nMilky Way disk.\n", "  Several models of the charge transfer exciton (CTE) have been proposed to\nexplain its dissociation at the donor-acceptor (DA) interface. However, the\nunderlying physics is still under debate. Here, we derive temperature\n($T$)-dependent tight-binding model for an electron-hole pair at the DA\ninterface. The main finding is the existence of the localization-delocalization\ntransition at a critical $T$, which can explain the CTE dissociation. The\npresent study highlights the combined effect of entropy (finite-$T$) and\ncarrier delocalization in the CTE dissociation.\n", "  This study presents the first semi-quantum private comparison protocol under\nan almost-dishonest third party. The proposed protocol allows two classical\nparticipants to compare their secret information without compromising it's\nprivacy. The security analyses indicate that the protocol is free from several\nwell-known attacks.\n", "  Purpose : The aim of this paper is to study the elastic Coulomb breakup of\n$^{34}$Na on $^{208}$Pb to give us a core of $^{33}$Na with a neutron and in\nthe process we try and investigate the one neutron separation energy and the\nground state configuration of $^{34}$Na.\n  Method : A fully quantum mechanical Coulomb breakup theory within the\narchitecture of post-form finite range distorted wave Born approximation\nextended to include the effects of deformation is used to research the elastic\nCoulomb breakup of $^{34}$Na on $^{208}$Pb at 100 MeV/u. The triple\ndifferential cross-section calculated for the breakup is integrated over the\ndesired components to find the total cross-section, momentum and angular\ndistributions as well as the average momenta, along with the energy-angular\ndistributions.\n  Results : The total one neutron removal cross-section is calculated to test\nthe possible ground state configurations of $^{34}$Na. The average momentum\nresults along with energy-angular calculations indicate $^{34}$Na to have a\nhalo structure. The parallel momentum distributions with narrow full widths at\nhalf maxima signify the same.\n  Conclusion : We have attempted to analyse the possible ground state\nconfigurations of $^{34}$Na and in congruity with the patterns in the `island\nof inversion' conclude that even without deformation, $^{34}$Na should be a\nneutron halo with a predominant contribution to its ground state most probably\ncoming from $^{33}$Na($3/2^{+}$) $\\otimes$ $2p_{3/2}\\nu$ configuration. We also\nsurmise that it would certainly be useful and rewarding to test our predictions\nwith an experiment to put stricter limits on its ground state configuration and\nbinding energy.\n", "  NGC 5548 is the best-observed reverberation-mapped active galactic nucleus\nwith long-term, intensive monitoring. Here we report results from a new\nobservational campaign between January and July, 2015. We measure the centroid\ntime lag of the broad H$\\beta$ emission line with respect to the 5100 \\AA\ncontinuum and obtain $\\tau_{\\rm cent} = 7.20^{+1.33}_{-0.35}$ days in the rest\nframe. This yields a black hole mass of $M_{\\bullet}=8.71^{+3.21}_{-2.61} $x$\n10^{7}M_{\\odot}$ using a broad H$\\beta$ line dispersion of $3124\\pm302$ km\ns$^{-1}$ and a virial factor of $f_{_{\\rm BLR}}=6.3\\pm1.5$ for the broad-line\nregion (BLR), consistent with the mass measurements from previous H$\\beta$\ncampaigns. The high-quality data allow us to construct a velocity-binned delay\nmap for the broad H$\\beta$ line, which shows a symmetric response pattern\naround the line center, a plausible kinematic signature of virialized motion of\nthe BLR. Combining all the available measurements of H$\\beta$ time lags and the\nassociated mean 5100 {\\AA} luminosities over 18 campaigns between 1989 and\n2015, we find that the H$\\beta$ BLR size varies with the mean optical\nluminosity, but, interestingly, with a possible delay of $2.35_{-1.25}^{+3.47}$\nyrs. This delay coincides with the typical BLR dynamical timescale of NGC 5548,\nindicating that the BLR undergoes dynamical changes, possibly driven by\nradiation pressure.\n", "  We study the influence of laser profile on the linewidth of the optical\nspectrum of multi-photon resonance phenomena. First, we investigate the\ndependence of the absorption spectrum on the laser profile in a two-level\nsystem. Thanks to the Laguerre-Gaussian field, the linewidth of the one-photon\noptical pumping and two-photon absorption peaks are explicitly narrower than\nthat obtained with a Gaussian field. In next section, it is shown that,\ncomparing with the the Gaussian fields, the Laguerre-Gaussian ones reduce the\nlinewidth of the optical spectrum in the coherent population trapping.\nInterestingly, it turns out that its use of a Laguerre-Gaussian beam makes the\nlinewidth of the spectrum narrower as compared with a Gaussian one in a\nDoppler-broadened electromagnetically induced transparency. Moreover, we study\nthe effect of the laser profile on the Autler-Townes doublet structure in the\nabsorption spectrum for a laser-driven four-level atomic system. We also\nconsider the different values of the Laguerre-Gaussian mode beam waist, and,\nperhaps more remarkable, we find that for the small values of waist, the\nAutler-Townes doublet can be removed and a prominent narrow central peak\nappears in the absorption spectrum. Finally, we investigate the effect of the\nlaser profile on the linewidth of the sub-natural three-photon absorption peak\nof double dark resonance. The differences in the linewidth are quite large,\noffering potential applications in metrology and isotope separation methods.\nOur results can be used for super ultra high resolution laser spectroscopy and\nto improve the resolution of the technology of isotope/isomer separation and\nphoto-biology even at essential overlap of the spectra of the different\nparticles.\n", "  The emergence of clustering and coarsening in crowded ensembles of\nself-propelled agents is studied using a lattice model in one-dimension. The\npersistent exclusion process, where particles move at directions that change\nrandomly at a low tumble rate $\\alpha$, is extended allowing sites to be\noccupied by more than one particle, with a maximum $n_\\text{max}$ per site.\nThree phases are distinguished. For $n_\\text{max}=1$ a gas of clusters form,\nwith sizes distributed exponentially and no coarsening takes place. For\n$n_\\text{max}\\geq 3$ and small values of $\\alpha$, coarsening takes place and\nfew large clusters appear, with a large fraction of the total number of\nparticles in them. In the same range of $n_\\text{max}$ but for larger values of\n$\\alpha$, a gas phase where a negligible fraction of particles takes part of\nclusters. Finally, $n_\\text{max}=2$ corresponds to a crossover phase. The\ncharacter of the transitions between phases is studied extending the model to\nallow $n_\\text{max}$ to take real values and jumps to an occupied site are\nprobabilistic. The transition from the gas of clusters to the coarsening phase\nis continuous and the mass of the large clusters grows continuously when\nvarying the maximum occupancy, and the crossover found corresponds to values\nclose to the transition. The second transition, from the coarsening to the\ngaseous phase can be either continuous or discontinuous depending on the\nparameters, with a critical point separating both cases.\n", "  We study interactions between polaritons, arising when photons strongly\ncouple to collective excitations in an array of two-level atoms trapped in an\noptical lattice inside a cavity. We consider two types of interactions between\natoms: Dipolar forces and atomic saturability, which ranges from hard-core\nrepulsion to Rydberg blockade. We show that, in spite of the underlying\nrepulsion in the subsystem of atomic excitations, saturability induces a\nbroadband bunching of photons for two-polariton scattering states. We interpret\nthis bunching as a result of interference, and trace it back to the mismatch of\nthe quantization volumes for atomic excitations and photons. We examine also\nbound bipolaritonic states: These include states created by dipolar forces, as\nwell as a gap bipolariton, which forms solely due to saturability effects in\nthe atomic transition. Both types of bound states exhibit strong bunching in\nthe photonic component. We discuss the dependence of bunching on experimentally\nrelevant parameters.\n", "  We discuss the spin excitations in systems with hopping electron conduction\nand strong position disorder. We focus on the problem in a strong magnetic\nfield when the spin Hamiltonian can be reduced to the effective single-particle\nHamiltonian and treated with conventional numerical technics. It is shown that\nin a 3D system with Heisenberg exchange interaction the spin excitations have a\ndelocalized part of the spectrum even in the limit of strong disorder, thus\nleading to the possibility of the coherent spin transport. The spin transport\nprovided by the delocalized excitations can be described by a diffusion\ncoefficient. Non-homogenous magnetic fields lead to the Anderson localization\nof spin excitations while anisotropy of the exchange interaction results in the\nLifshitz localization of excitations. We discuss the possible effect of the\nadditional exchange-driven spin diffusion on the organic spin-valve devices.\n", "  We report results of the analysis of the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB)\nin the basic (actually, simplest) model which is capable to produce the SSB\nphenomenology in the one-dimensional setting. It is based on the\nGross-Pitaevskii - nonlinear Schroedinger equation with the cubic\nself-attractive term and a double-well-potential built as an infinitely deep\npotential box split by a narrow (delta-functional) barrier. The barrier's\nstrength, epsilon, is the single free parameter of the scaled form of the\nmodel. It may be implemented in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates and nonlinear\noptics. The SSB bifurcation of the symmetric ground state (GS) is predicted\nanalytically in two limit cases, viz., for deep or weak splitting of the\npotential box by the barrier. For the generic case, a variational approximation\n(VA) is elaborated. The analytical findings are presented along with systematic\nnumerical results. Stability of stationary states is studied through the\ncalculation of eigenvalues for small perturbations, and by means of direct\nsimulations. The GS always undergoes the SSB bifurcation of the supercritical\ntype, as predicted by the VA at moderate values of epsilon, although the VA\nfails at small epsilon, due to inapplicability of the underlying ansatz in that\ncase. However, the latter case is correctly treated by the approximation based\non a soliton ansatz. On top of the GS, the first and second excited states are\nstudied too. The antisymmetric mode (the first excited state) is destabilized\nat a critical value of its norm. The second excited state undergoes the SSB\nbifurcation, like the GS, but, unlike it, the bifurcation produces an unstable\nasymmetric mode. All unstable modes tend to spontaneously reshape into the\nasymmetric GS.\n", "  We study the superconductor-insulator transition in nanohole ultrathin films\nin a transverse magnetic field by numerical simulation of a Josephson-junction\narray model. Geometrical disorder due to the random location of nanoholes in\nthe film corresponds to random flux in the array model. Monte Carlo simulation\nin the path-integral representation is used to determine the critical behavior\nand the universal resistivity at the transition as a function of disorder and\naverage number of flux quanta per cell, $f_o$. The resistivity increases with\ndisorder for noninteger $ f_o$ while it decreases for integer $ f_o$, and\nreaches a common constant value in a vortex-glass regime above a critical value\nof the flux disorder $D_f^c$. The estimate of $D_f^c$ and the resistivity\nincrease for noninteger $ f_o$ are consistent with recent experiments on\nultrathin superconducting films with positional disordered nanoholes.\n", "  We aim to use the a new and improved version of AKARI all sky survey\ncatalogue of far-infrared sources to recalibrate the formula to derive the\ntotal infrared luminosity. We cross-match the faint source catalogue (FSC) of\nIRAS with the new AKARI-FIS and obtained a sample of 2430 objects. Then we\ncalculate the total infrared (TIR) luminosity $L_{\\textrm{TIR}}$ from the\nSanders at al. (1996) formula and compare it with total infrared luminosity\nfrom AKARI FIS bands to obtain new coefficients for the general relation to\nconvert FIR luminosity from AKARI bands to the TIR luminosity.\n", "  By considering three different Nucleon-Nucleon (NN) elastic differential\ncross sections: the Cugnon \\emph{et al.} parameterized differential cross\nsection [Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res., Sect. \\textbf{B111}, 215 (1996)],\nand the differential cross section derived from the collision term of the\nself-consistent relativistic Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck equation proposed by\nMao \\emph{et al.} [Z.\\ Phys.\\ A {\\bf 347}, 173 (1994)], as well as the\nisotropic differential cross section, within the newly updated version of the\nultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) model, the influence of\nthe differential elastic NN cross section on various observables (e.g., nuclear\nstopping, both the rapidity and transverse-velocity dependence of the directed\nand elliptic flows) in Au+Au collisions at beam energies 150, 250, 400, and 800\nMeV$/$nucleon is investigated. By comparing calculations with those three\ndifferential cross sections, it is found that the nuclear stopping power, the\ndirected and elliptic flows are affected to some extent by the differential\ncross sections, and the impact of differential cross section on those\nobservables becomes more visible as the beam energy increases. The effect on\nthe elliptic flow difference $v_{2}^{n}$-$v_{2}^{H}$ and ratio\n$v_{2}^{n}$/$v_{2}^{H}$ of neutrons versus hydrogen isotopes ($Z=1$), which\nhave been used as sensitive observables for probing nuclear symmetry energy at\nhigh densities, is weak.\n", "  Disordered many-particle hyperuniform systems are exotic amorphous states\ncharacterized by anomalous suppression of large-scale density fluctuations.\nHere we substantially broaden the hyperuniformity concept along four different\ndirections. This includes generalizations to treat fluctuations in the\ninterfacial area in heterogeneous media and surface-area driven evolving\nmicrostructures, random scalar fields, divergence-free random vector fields, as\nwell as statistically anisotropic many-particle systems and two-phase media.\nInterfacial-area fluctuations play a major role in characterizing the\nmicrostructure of two-phase systems , physical properties that intimately\ndepend on the geometry of the interface, and evolving two-phase microstructures\nthat depend on interfacial energies (e.g., spinodal decomposition). In the\ninstances of divergence-free random vector fields and statistically anisotropic\nstructures, we show that the standard definition of hyperuniformity must be\ngeneralized such that it accounts for the dependence of the relevant spectral\nfunctions on the direction in which the origin in Fourier space\n(nonanalyticities at the origin). Using this analysis, we place some well-known\nenergy spectra from the theory of isotropic turbulence in the context of this\ngeneralization of hyperuniformity. We show that there exist many-particle\nground-state configurations in which directional hyperuniformity imparts exotic\nanisotropic physical properties (e.g., elastic, optical and acoustic\ncharacteristics) to these states of matter. Such tunablity could have\ntechnological relevance for manipulating light and sound waves in ways\nheretofore not thought possible. We show that disordered many-particle systems\nthat respond to external fields (e.g., magnetic and electric fields) are a\nnatural class of materials to look for directional hyperuniformity.\n", "  In this paper we address the problem of dark energy oscillations in the\ncontext of mimetic $F(R)$ gravity with potential. The issue of dark energy\noscillations can be a problem in some models of ordinary $F(R)$ gravity and a\nremedy that can make the oscillations milder is to introduce additional\nmodifications in the functional form of the $F(R)$ gravity. As we demonstrate\nthe power-law modifications are not necessary in the mimetic $F(R)$ case, and\nby appropriately choosing the mimetic potential and the Lagrange multiplier, it\nis possible to make the oscillations almost to vanish at the end of the matter\ndomination era and during the late-time acceleration era. We examine the\nbehavior of the dark energy equation of state parameter and of the total\neffective equation of state parameter as functions of the redshift and we\ncompare the resulting picture with the ordinary $F(R)$ gravity case. As we also\nshow, the present day values of the dark energy equation of state parameter and\nof the total effective equation of state parameter are in better agreement with\nthe observational data, in comparison to the ordinary $F(R)$ gravity case.\nFinally, we study the evolution of the growth factor as a function of the\nredshift for all the mimetic models we shall use.\n", "  It is shown, using results of recent direct numerical simulations, laboratory\nexperiments and atmospheric measurements, that buoyancy driven turbulence\nexhibits a broad diversity of the types of distributed chaos with its stretched\nexponential spectrum $\\exp(-k/k_{\\beta})^{\\beta}$. The distributed chaos with\n$\\beta = 1/3$ (determined by the helicity correlation integral) is the most\ncommon feature of the stably stratified turbulence (due to the strong helical\nwaves presence). These waves mostly dominate spectral properties of the\nvertical component of velocity field, while the horizontal component is\ndominated by the diffusive processes both for the weak and strong stable\nstratification ($\\beta =2/3$). For the last case influence of the low boundary\ncan overcome the wave effects and result in $\\beta =1/2$ for the vertical\ncomponent of the velocity field (the spontaneous breaking of the space\ntranslational symmetry - homogeneity). For the unstably stratified turbulence\nin the Rayleigh-Taylor mixing zone the diffusive processes ($\\beta =2/3$) are\nthe most common dominating processes in the anisotropic chaotic mixing of the\ntwo fluids under buoyancy forces. The distributed chaos in Rayleigh-B\\'{e}nard\nturbulent convection in an upright cell is determined by the strong confinement\nconditions. That is: the spontaneous breaking of the space translational\nsymmetry (homogeneity) by the finite boundaries ($\\beta = 1/2$) or by the\nnon-perfect orientation of the cell along the buoyancy direction ($\\beta\n=4/7$). In all types of turbulence appearance of an inertial range of scales\nresults in deformation of the distributed chaos and $\\beta =3/5$.\n", "  Two in-situ experimental methods are presented in which dust particles are\nused to determine the extent of the sheath and gain information about the\ntime-averaged electric force profile within a RF plasma sheath. These methods\nare advantageous because they are not only simple and quick to carry out, but\nthey also can be performed using standard dusty plasma experimental equipment.\nIn the first method, dust particles are tracked as they fall through the plasma\ntoward the lower electrode. These trajectories are then used to determine the\nelectric force on the particle as a function of height as well as the extent of\nthe sheath. In the second method, dust particle levitation height is measured\nacross a wide range of RF voltages. Similarities were observed between the two\nexperiments, but in order to understand the underlying physics behind these\nobservations, the same conditions were replicated using a self-consistent fluid\nmodel. Through comparison of the fluid model and experimental results, it is\nshown that the particles exhibiting a levitation height that is independent of\nRF voltage indicate the sheath edge - the boundary between the quasineutral\nbulk plasma and the sheath. Therefore, both of these simple and inexpensive,\nyet effective, methods can be applied across a wide range of experimental\nparameters in any ground-based RF plasma chamber to gain useful information\nregarding the sheath, which is needed for interpretation of dusty plasma\nexperiments.\n", "  When a neutron star forms, after the collapse of its progenitor, a strong\nmagnetic field survives in its interior. This magnetic topology is usually\nassumed to be well approximated by a dipole located right at the centre of the\nstar. However, there is no particular reason why this dipole should be attached\nto this very special point. A slight shift from the stellar centre could have\nstrong implications for the surrounding electromagnetic field configuration\nleading to clear observational signatures. We study the effect of the most\ngeneral off-centred dipole anchored in the neutron star interior. Exact\nanalytical solutions are given in vacuum outside the star to any order of\naccuracy in the small parameter $\\epsilon = d/R$, where $d$ is the displacement\nof the dipole from the stellar centre and $R$ the neutron star radius. As a\nsimple diagnostic of this decentred dipole, the spin-down luminosity and the\ntorque exerted on its crust are computed to the lowest leading order\nin~$\\epsilon$. Results are compared to earlier works and a discussion on\nrepercussions on pulsar braking index and multi-wavelength light curves is\nproposed.\n", "  Strong magnetic fields have important effects on the crustal properties of\nmagnetars. Here we study the magneto-elastic oscillations of magnetars taking\ninto consideration the effect of strong magnetic fields on the crustal\ncomposition (magnetised crust). We calculate global magneto-elastic (GME) modes\nas well as modes confined to the crust (CME) only. The composition of the crust\ndirectly affects its shear modulus which we calculate using three different\nnucleon-nucleon interactions: SLy4, SkM and Sk272. The shear modulus of the\ncrust is found to be enhanced in strong magnetic fields $\\geq 10^{17}$ G for\nall those Skyrme interactions. It is noted that the shear modulus of the crust\nfor the SLy4 interaction is much higher than those of the SkM and Sk272\ninteractions in presence of magnetic fields or not. Though we do not find any\nappreciable change in frequencies of fundamental GME and CME modes with and\nwithout magnetised crusts, frequencies of first overtones of CME modes are\nsignificantly affected in strong magnetic fields $\\geq 10^{17}$ G. However,\nthis feature is not observed in frequencies of first overtones of GME modes. As\nin earlier studies, it is also noted that the effects of crusts on frequencies\nof both types of maneto-elastic modes disappear when the magnetic field reaches\nthe critical field ($B > 4 \\times 10^{15}$ G). Frequencies of GME and CME modes\ncalculated with magnetised crusts based on all three nucleon-nucleon\ninteractions, stellar models and magnetic fields, are compared with frequencies\nof observed quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOS) in SGR 1806-20 and SGR1900+14.\nAs in earlier studies, this comparison indicates that GME modes are essential\nto explain all the frequencies as CME modes can explain only the higher\nfrequencies.\n", "  The HgTe quantum well (QW) is a well-characterized two-dimensional\ntopological insulator (2D-TI). Its band gap is relatively small (typically on\nthe order of 10 meV), which restricts the observation of purely topological\nconductance to low temperatures. Here, we utilize the strain-dependence of the\nband structure of HgTe QWs to address this limitation. We use\n$\\text{CdTe}-\\text{Cd}_{0.5}\\text{Zn}_{0.5}\\text{Te}$ strained-layer\nsuperlattices on GaAs as virtual substrates with adjustable lattice constant to\ncontrol the strain of the QW. We present magneto-transport measurements, which\ndemonstrate a transition from a semi- metallic to a 2D-TI regime in wide QWs,\nwhen the strain is changed from tensile to compressive. Most notably, we\ndemonstrate a much enhanced energy gap of 55 meV in heavily compressively\nstrained QWs. This value exceeds the highest possible gap on common II-VI\nsubstrates by a factor of 2-3, and extends the regime where the topological\nconductance prevails to much higher temperatures.\n", "  The temperature distribution of field Li-rich red giants suggests the\npresence of a population of Li-rich red clump (RC) stars. One proposed\nexplanation for this population is that all stars with masses near 2 $M_\\odot$\nexperience a short-lived phase of Li-richness at the onset of core He-burning.\nMany of these stars have low 12C/13C, a signature of deep mixing that is\npresumably associated with the Li regeneration. To test this purported\nmechanism of Li enrichment, we measured abundances in 38 RC stars and 6 red\ngiant branch (RGB) stars in four open clusters selected to have RC masses near\n2 $M_\\odot$. We find six Li-rich stars (A(Li) > 1.50 dex) of which only two may\nbe RC stars. None of the RC stars have Li exceeding the levels observed in the\nRGB stars, but given the brevity of the suggested Li-rich phase and the modest\nsample size, it is probable that stars with larger Li-enrichments were missed\nsimply by chance. However, we find very few stars in our sample with low\n12C/13C. Such low 12C/13C, seen in many field Li-rich stars, should persist\neven after lithium has returned to normal low levels. Thus, if Li synthesis\nduring the He flash occurs, it is a rare, but potentially long-lived occurrence\nrather than a short-lived phase for all stars. We estimate a conservative upper\nlimit of the fraction of stars going through a Li-rich phase to be <47\\%, based\non stars that have low 12C/13C for their observed A(Li).\n", "  We continue to build support for the proposal to use HII galaxies (HIIGx) and\ngiant extragalactic HII regions (GEHR) as standard candles to construct the\nHubble diagram at redshifts beyond the current reach of Type Ia supernovae.\nUsing a sample of 25 high-redshift HIIGx, 107 local HIIGx, and 24 GEHR, we\nconfirm that the correlation between the emission-line luminosity and\nionized-gas velocity dispersion is a viable luminosity indicator, and use it to\ntest and compare the standard model $\\Lambda$CDM and the $R_{\\rm h}=ct$\nUniverse by optimizing the parameters in each cosmology using a maximization of\nthe likelihood function. For the flat $\\Lambda$CDM model, the best fit is\nobtained with $\\Omega_{\\rm m}= 0.40_{-0.09}^{+0.09}$. However, statistical\ntools, such as the Akaike (AIC), Kullback (KIC) and Bayes (BIC) Information\nCriteria favor $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ over the standard model with a likelihood of\n$\\approx 94.8\\%-98.8\\%$ versus only $\\approx 1.2\\%-5.2\\%$. For $w$CDM (the\nversion of $\\Lambda$CDM with a dark-energy equation of state $w_{\\rm de}\\equiv\np_{\\rm de}/\\rho_{\\rm de}$ rather than $w_{\\rm de}=w_{\\Lambda}=-1$), a\nstatistically acceptable fit is realized with $\\Omega_{\\rm\nm}=0.22_{-0.14}^{+0.16}$ and $w_{\\rm de}= -0.51_{-0.25}^{+0.15}$ which,\nhowever, are not fully consistent with their concordance values. In this case,\n$w$CDM has two more free parameters than $R_{\\rm h}=ct$, and is penalized more\nheavily by these criteria. We find that $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ is strongly favored over\n$w$CDM with a likelihood of $\\approx 92.9\\%-99.6\\%$ versus only $0.4\\%-7.1\\%$.\nThe current HIIGx sample is already large enough for the BIC to rule out\n$\\Lambda$CDM/$w$CDM in favor of $R_{\\rm h}=ct$ at a confidence level\napproaching $3\\sigma$.\n", "  Using wave function matching approach and employing the Landauer-Buttiker\nformula a ferromagnetic graphene junction with a temperature gradient across\nthe system, is studied. We calculate the thermally induced charge and spin\ncurrent as well as the thermoelectric voltage (Seebeck effect) in the linear\nand nonlinear regimes. Our calculation revealed that due to the electron-hole\nsymmetry, the charge Seebeck coefficient is, for an undoped magnetic graphene,\nan odd function of chemical potential while the spin Seebeck coefficient is an\neven function regardless of the temperature gradient and junction length. We\nhave also found with an accurate tuning external parameter, namely the exchange\nfiled and gate voltage, the temperature gradient across the junction drives a\npure spin current without accompanying the charge current. Another important\ncharacteristic of thermoelectric transport, thermally induced current in the\nnonlinear regime, is examined. It would be our main finding that with\nincreasing thermal gradient applied to the junction the spin and charge\nthermovoltages decrease and even become zero for non-zero temperature bias.\n", "  We present a reformulation of the Hairy Probe method for introducing\nelectronic open boundaries that is appropriate for steady state calculations\ninvolving non-orthogonal atomic basis sets. As a check on the correctness of\nthe method we investigate a perfect atomic wire of Cu atoms, and a perfect\nnon-orthogonal chain of H atoms. For both atom chains we find that the\nconductance has a value of exactly one quantum unit, and that this is rather\ninsensitive to the strength of coupling of the probes to the system, provided\nvalues of the coupling are of the same order as the mean inter-level spacing of\nthe system without probes. For the Cu atom chain we find in addition that away\nfrom the regions with probes attached, the potential in the wire is uniform,\nwhile within them it follows a predicted exponential variation with position.\nWe then apply the method to an initial investigation of the suitability of\ngraphene as a contact material for molecular electronics. We perform\ncalculations on a carbon nanoribbon to determine the correct coupling strength\nof the probes to the graphene, and obtain a conductance of about two quantum\nunits corresponding to two bands crossing the Fermi surface. We then compute\nthe current through a benzene molecule attached to two graphene contacts and\nfind only a very weak current because of the disruption of the\n$\\pi$-conjugation by the covalent bond between the benzene and the graphene. In\nall cases we find that very strong or weak probe couplings suppress the\ncurrent.\n", "  In the second paper of the series we continue the investigation of open\ncluster fundamental parameters using a robust global optimization method to fit\nmodel isochrones to photometric data. We present optical UBVRI CCD photometry\n(Johnsons-Cousins system) observations for 24 neglected open clusters, of which\n14 have high quality data in the visible obtained for the first time, as a part\nof our ongoing survey being carried out in the 0.6m telescope of the Pico dos\nDias Observatory in Brazil. All objects were then analyzed with a global\noptimization tool developed by our group which estimates the membership\nlikelihood of the observed stars and fits an isochrone from which a distance,\nage, reddening, total to selective extinction ratio $R_{V}$ (included in this\nwork as a new free parameter) and metallicity are estimated. Based on those\nestimates and their associated errors we analyzed the status of each object as\nreal clusters or not, finding that two are likely to be asterisms. We also\nidentify important discrepancies between our results and previous ones obtained\nin the literature which were determined using 2MASS photometry.\n", "  $v_W$ leptokurtic asteroid families are families for which the distribution\nof the normal component of the terminal ejection velocity field $v_W$ is\ncharacterized by a positive value of the ${\\gamma}_2$ Pearson kurtosis, i.e.,\nthey have a distribution with a more concentrated peak and larger tails than\nthe Gaussian one. Currently, eight families are known to have ${\\gamma}_2(v_W)\n> 0.25$. Among these, three are highly inclined asteroid families, the Hansa,\nBarcelona, and Gallia families. As observed for the case of the Astrid family,\nthe leptokurtic inclination distribution seems to be caused by the interaction\nof these families with node secular resonances. In particular, the Hansa and\nGallia family are crossed by the $s-s_V$ resonance with Vesta, that\nsignificantly alters the inclination of some of their members.\n  In this work we use the time evolution of ${\\gamma}_2(v_W)$ for simulated\nfamilies under the gravitational influence of all planets and the three most\nmassive bodies in the main belt to assess the dynamical importance (or lack of)\nnode secular resonances with Ceres, Vesta, and Pallas for the considered\nfamilies, and to obtain independent constraints on the family ages. While\nsecular resonances with massive bodies in the main belt do not significantly\naffect the dynamical evolution of the Barcelona family, they significantly\nincrease the ${\\gamma}_2(v_W)$ values of the simulated Hansa and Gallia\nfamilies. Current values of the ${\\gamma}_2(v_W)$ for the Gallia family are\nreached over the estimated family age only if secular resonances with Vesta are\naccounted for.\n", "  We analyze the properties of the circumgalactic gas (CGM) around 120 galaxies\nwith stellar and dark matter halo masses similar to that of the Milky Way. We\nfocus on the morphology and kinematics of the neutral hydrogen and how this\ndepends on f_g, the ratio of gas-to-stellar mass within the optical radius. In\ngas-rich galaxies with f_g > 0.1, gas temperatures rise slowly from center of\nthe halo out to the virial radius and average neutral gas column densities\nremain above 10^19 atoms cm^-2 out to radii of 50-70 kpc. In gas-poor galaxies\nwith f_g < 0.1, gas temperatures rise quickly outside the edge of the disk to\n10^6 K, and then remain fixed out to radii of 100 kpc. The column density of\nneutral gas quickly drops below 10^19 atoms cm^-2 at radii of 10 kpc. Neutral\ngas distributions are also more asymmetric in gas-poor galaxies. Most of the\ndifferences between gas-poor and gas-rich galaxies in the Illustris simulation\ncan be attributed to the effects of \"radio-mode\" AGN feedback. In the Illustris\nsimulation, the circumgalactic gas is found to rotate coherently about the\ncenter of the galaxy with a maximum rotational velocity of around 200 km/s. In\ngas-rich galaxies, the average coherence length of the rotating gas is 40 kpc,\ncompared to 10 kpc in gas-poor galaxies. In the very most gas-rich systems, the\nCGM can rotate coherently over scales of 70-100 kpc. We discuss our results in\nthe context of recent observations of the CGM in low mass galaxies via UV\nabsorption-line spectroscopy and deep 21cm observations of edge-on spiral\ngalaxies.\n", "  We examined the reliability of estimates of pseudoisothermal, Burkert and NFW\ndark halo parameters for the methods based on the mass-modelling of the\nrotation curves.To do it we constructed the $\\chi^2$ maps for the grid of the\ndark matter halo parameters for a sample of 14 disc galaxies with high quality\nrotation curves from THINGS. We considered two variants of models in which: a)\nthe mass-to-light ratios of disc and bulge were taken as free parameters, b)\nthe mass-to-light ratios were fixed in a narrow range according to the models\nof stellar populations.\n  To reproduce the possible observational features of the real galaxies we made\ntests showing that the parameters of the three halo types change critically in\nthe cases of a lack of kinematic data in the central or peripheral areas and\nfor different spatial resolutions.\n  We showed that due to the degeneracy between the central densities and the\nradial scales of the dark haloes there are considerable uncertainties of their\nconcentrations estimates. Due to this reason it is also impossible to draw any\nfirm conclusion about universality of the dark halo column density based on\nmass-modelling of even a high quality rotation curve. The problem is not solved\nby fixing the density of baryonic matter.\n  In contrast, the estimates of dark halo mass within optical radius are much\nmore reliable. We demonstrated that one can evaluate successfully the halo mass\nusing the pure best-fitting method without any restrictions on the\nmass-to-light ratios.\n", "  The mass loss rates of red supergiants (RSGs) govern their evolution towards\nsupernova and dictate the appearance of the resulting explosion. To study how\nmass-loss rates change with evolution we measure the mass-loss rates (\\mdot)\nand extinctions of 19 red supergiants in the young massive cluster NGC2100 in\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud. By targeting stars in a coeval cluster we can study\nthe mass-loss rate evolution whilst keeping the variables of mass and\nmetallicity fixed. Mass-loss rates were determined by fitting DUSTY models to\nmid-IR photometry from WISE and Spitzer/IRAC. We find that the \\mdot\\ in red\nsupergiants increases as the star evolves, and is well described by \\mdot\\\nprescription of de Jager, used widely in stellar evolution calculations. We\nfind the extinction caused by the warm dust is negligible, meaning the warm\ncircumstellar material of the inner wind cannot explain the higher levels of\nextinction found in the RSGs compared to other cluster stars. We discuss the\nimplications of this work in terms of supernova progenitors and stellar\nevolution theory. We argue there is little justification for substantially\nincreasing the \\mdot\\ during the RSG phase, as has been suggested recently in\norder to explain the absence of high mass Type IIP supernova progenitors. We\nalso argue that an increase in reddening towards the end of the RSG phase, as\nobserved for the two most evolved cluster stars, may provide a solution to the\nred supergiant problem.\n", "  Studies on how to model the interplay between diseases and behavioral\nresponses (so-called coupled disease-behavior interaction) have attracted\nincreasing attention. Owing to the lack of obvious clinical evidence of\ndiseases, or the incomplete information related to the disease, the risks of\ninfection cannot be perceived and may lead to inappropriate behavioral\nresponses. Therefore, how to quantitatively analyze the impacts of asymptomatic\ninfection on the interplay between diseases and behavioral responses is of\nparticular importance. In this Letter, under the complex network framework, we\nstudy the coupled disease-behavior interaction model by dividing infectious\nindividuals into two states: U-state (without evident clinical symptoms,\nlabelled as U) and I-state (with evident clinical symptoms, labelled as I). A\nsusceptible individual can be infected by U- or I-nodes, however, since the\nU-nodes cannot be easily observed, susceptible individuals take behavioral\nresponses \\emph{only} when they contact I-nodes. The mechanism is considered in\nthe improved Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model and the improved\nSusceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, respectively. Then, one of the most\nconcerned problems in spreading dynamics: the epidemic thresholds for the two\nmodels are given by two methods. The analytic results \\emph{quantitatively}\ndescribe the influence of different factors, such as asymptomatic infection,\nthe awareness rate, the network structure, and so forth, on the epidemic\nthresholds. Moreover, because of the irreversible process of the SIR model, the\nsuppression effect of the improved SIR model is weaker than the improved SIS\nmodel.\n", "  We present a comparison of SCUBA-2 850-$\\mu$m and Herschel 70--500-$\\mu$m\nobservations of the L1495 filament in the Taurus Molecular Cloud with the goal\nof characterising the SCUBA-2 Gould Belt Survey (GBS) data set. We identify and\ncharacterise starless cores in three data sets: SCUBA-2 850-$\\mu$m, Herschel\n250-$\\mu$m, and Herschel 250-$\\mu$m spatially filtered to mimic the SCUBA-2\ndata. SCUBA-2 detects only the highest-surface-brightness sources, principally\ndetecting protostellar sources and starless cores embedded in filaments, while\nHerschel is sensitive to most of the cloud structure, including extended\nlow-surface-brightness emission. Herschel detects considerably more sources\nthan SCUBA-2 even after spatial filtering. We investigate which properties of a\nstarless core detected by Herschel determine its detectability by SCUBA-2, and\nfind that they are the core's temperature and column density (for given dust\nproperties). For similar-temperature cores, such as those seen in L1495, the\nsurface brightnesses of the cores are determined by their column densities,\nwith the highest-column-density cores being detected by SCUBA-2. For roughly\nspherical geometries, column density corresponds to volume density, and so\nSCUBA-2 selects the densest cores from a population at a given temperature.\nThis selection effect, which we quantify as a function of distance, makes\nSCUBA-2 ideal for identifying those cores in Herschel catalogues that are\nclosest to forming stars. Our results can now be used by anyone wishing to use\nthe SCUBA-2 GBS data set.\n", "  We investigate how accurately phase space distribution functions (DFs) in\ngalactic models can be reconstructed by a made-to-measure (M2M) method, which\nconstructs $N$-particle models of stellar systems from photometric and various\nkinematic data. The advantage of the M2M method is that this method can be\napplied to various galactic models without assumption of the spatial symmetries\nof gravitational potentials adopted in galactic models, and furthermore,\nnumerical calculations of the orbits of the stars cannot be severely\nconstrained by the capacities of computer memories. The M2M method has been\napplied to various galactic models. However, the degree of accuracy for the\nrecovery of DFs derived by the M2M method in galactic models has never been\ninvestigated carefully. Therefore, we show the degree of accuracy for the\nrecovery of the DFs for the anisotropic Plummer model and the axisymmetric\nSt\\\"{a}ckel model, which have analytic solutions of the DFs. Furthermore, this\nstudy provides the dependence of the degree of accuracy for the recovery of the\nDFs on various parameters and a procedure adopted in this paper. As a result,\nwe find that the degree of accuracy for the recovery of the DFs derived by the\nM2M method for the spherical target model is a few percent, and more than ten\npercent for the axisymmetric target model.\n", "  We present the data reduction procedures being used by the GALAH survey,\ncarried out with the HERMES fibre-fed, multi-object spectrograph on the 3.9~m\nAnglo-Australian Telescope. GALAH is a unique survey, targeting 1 million stars\nbrighter than magnitude V=14 at a resolution of 28,000 with a goal to measure\nthe abundances of 29 elements. Such a large number of high resolution spectra\nnecessitates the development of a reduction pipeline optimized for speed,\naccuracy, and consistency. We outline the design and structure of the\nIraf-based reduction pipeline that we developed, specifically for GALAH, to\nproduce fully calibrated spectra aimed for subsequent stellar atmospheric\nparameter estimation. The pipeline takes advantage of existing Iraf routines\nand other readily available software so as to be simple to maintain, testable\nand reliable. A radial velocity and stellar atmospheric parameter estimator\ncode is also presented, which is used for further data analysis and yields a\nuseful verification of the reduction quality. We have used this estimator to\nquantify the data quality of GALAH for fibre cross-talk level ($\\lesssim0.5$%)\nand scattered light ($\\sim5$ counts in a typical 20 minutes exposure),\nresolution across the field, sky spectrum properties, wavelength solution\nreliability (better than $1$ $\\mathrm{km\\ s^{-1}}$ accuracy) and radial\nvelocity precision.\n", "  The gain-loss asymmetry, observed in the inverse statistics of stock indices\nis present for logarithmic return levels that are over $2\\%$, and it is the\nresult of the non-Pearson type auto-correlations in the index. These\nnon-Pearson type correlations can be viewed also as functionally dependent\ndaily volatilities, extending for a finite time interval. A generalized\ntime-window shuffling method is used to show the existence of such\nauto-correlations. Their characteristic time-scale proves to be smaller (less\nthan $25$ trading days) than what was previously believed. It is also found\nthat this characteristic time-scale has decreased with the appearance of\nprogram trading in the stock market transactions. Connections with the leverage\neffect are also established.\n", "  LS 5039 is so far the best studied $\\gamma$-ray binary system at\nmulti-wavelength energies. A time resolved study of its spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) shows that above 1 keV its power output is changing along\nits binary orbit as well as being a function of energy. To disentangle the\nenergy dependence of the power output as a function of orbital phase, we\ninvestigated in detail the orbital light curves as derived with different\ntelescopes at different energy bands. We analysed the data from all existing\n\\textit{INTEGRAL}/IBIS/ISGRI observations of the source and generated the most\nup-to-date orbital light curves at hard X-ray energies. In the $\\gamma$-ray\nband, we carried out orbital phase-resolved analysis of \\textit{Fermi}-LAT data\nbetween 30 MeV and 10 GeV in 5 different energy bands. We found that, at\n$\\lesssim$100 MeV and $\\gtrsim$1 TeV the peak of the $\\gamma$-ray emission is\nnear orbital phase 0.7, while between $\\sim$100 MeV and $\\sim$1 GeV it moves\nclose to orbital phase 1.0 in an orbital anti-clockwise manner. This result\nsuggests that the transition region in the SED at soft $\\gamma$-rays (below a\nhundred MeV) is related to the orbital phase interval of 0.5--1.0 but not to\nthe one of 0.0--0.5, when the compact object is \"behind\" its companion. Another\ninteresting result is that between 3 and 20 GeV no orbital modulation is found,\nalthough \\textit{Fermi}-LAT significantly ($\\sim$18$\\sigma$) detects LS 5039.\nThis is consistent with the fact that at these energies, the contributions to\nthe overall emission from the inferior conjunction phase region (INFC, orbital\nphase 0.45 to 0.9) and from the superior conjunction phase region (SUPC,\norbital phase 0.9 to 0.45) are equal in strength. At TeV energies the power\noutput is again dominant in the INFC region and the flux peak occurs at phase\n$\\sim$0.7.\n", "  We present spectroscopic and photometric solutions for three spotted systems\nwith red giant components. Absolute physical and orbital parameters for these\ndouble-lined detached eclipsing binary stars are presented for the first time.\nThese were derived from the V-, and I-band ASAS and WASP photometry, and new\nradial velocities calculated from high quality optical spectra we obtained with\na wide range of spectrographs and using the two-dimensional cross-correlation\ntechnique (TODCOR). All of the investigated systems (ASAS J184949-1518.7, BQ\nAqr, and V1207 Cen) show the differential evolutionary phase of their\ncomponents consisting of a main sequence star or a subgiant and a red giant,\nand thus constitute very informative objects in terms of testing stellar\nevolution models. Additionally, the systems show significant chromospheric\nactivity of both components. They can be also classified as classical RS\nCVn-type stars. Besides the standard analysis of radial velocities and\nphotometry, we applied spectral disentangling to obtain separate spectra for\nboth components of each analysed system which allowed for a more detailed\nspectroscopic study. We also compared the properties of red giant stars in\nbinaries that show spots, with those that do not, and found that the activity\nphenomenon is substantially suppressed for stars with Rossby number higher than\n$\\sim$1 and radii larger than $\\sim$20 R$_\\odot$.\n", "  Collisions of ice particles play an important role in the formation of\nplanetesimals and comets. In recent work we showed, that CO$_2$ ice behaves\nlike silicates in collisions. The resulting assumption was that it should\ntherefore stick less efficiently than H$_2$O ice. Within this paper a\nquantification of the latter is presented. We used the same experimental setup\nto study collisions of pure CO$_2$ ice, pure water ice and 50\\% mixtures by\nmass between CO$_2$ and water at 80K, 1 mbar and an average particle size of\n$\\sim 90 \\mu$m. The results show a strong increase of the threshold velocity\nbetween sticking and bouncing with increasing water content. This supports the\nidea that water ice is favorable for early growth phases of planets in a zone\nwithin the H$_2$O and the CO$_2$ iceline.\n", "  We consider a two-level atomic system, interacting with an electromagnetic\nfield controlled in amplitude and frequency by a high intensity laser. We show\nthat the amplitude of the induced electric field, admits an envelope profile\ncorresponding to a breather soliton. We demonstrate that this soliton can\npropagate with any frequency shift with respect to that of the control laser,\nexcept a critical frequency, at which the system undergoes a structural\ndiscontinuity that transforms the breather in a rogue wave. A mechanism of\ngeneration of rogue waves by means of an intense laser field is thus revealed.\n", "  We report the synthesis and superconducting properties of the ternary\nphosphide ScRhP. The crystal structure of ScRhP is determined to be the ordered\nFe2P type with the hexagonal P-62m space group by powder X-ray diffraction\nexperiments. Resistivity, magnetization, and heat capacity data indicate that\nScRhP is a bulk superconductor with a transition temperature Tc of 2 K. This Tc\nis lower than that of its 5d analogue, ScIrP (Tc = 3.4 K), although ScRhP is\nfound to have larger electronic density of states at the Fermi energy and a\nhigher Debye temperature than those of ScIrP.\n", "  In this note we consider general formulation of Euler's equations for an\ninviscid incompressible homogeneous fluid with an oscillating body force. Our\naim is to derive the averaged equations for these flows with the help of\ntwo-timing method. Our main result is the general and simple form of the\nequation describing the averaged flows, which are derived without making any\nadditional assumptions. The presented results can have many interesting\napplications.\n", "  We present the path-integral solutions to the distributions in classical\n(Gibbs) and quantum (Wigner) statistical mechanics. The kernel of the\ndistributions are derived in two ways - one by time slicing and defining the\nappropriate short-time interval phase space matrix element and second by making\nuse of the kernel in the path-integral approach to quantum mechanics. We show\nthat the two approaches are perturbatively identical. We also present another\ncomputation for the Wigner kernel, which is also the Liouville kernel, for the\nharmonic oscillator and free particle. These kernels may be used as the\nstarting point in the perturbative expansion of the Wigner kernel for any\npotential. With the kernel solved, we essentially solve also the distributions\nin classical and quantum statistical mechanics.\n", "  In star-forming galaxies, stellar feedback can have a dual effect on the\ncircumgalactic medium both suppressing and stimulating gas accretion. The\ntrigger of gas accretion can be caused by disc material ejected into the halo\nin the form of fountain clouds and by its interaction with the surrounding hot\ncorona. Indeed, at the disc-corona interface, the mixing between the\ncold/metal-rich disc gas (T <~ 10^4 K) and the hot coronal gas (T >~ 10^6 K)\ncan dramatically reduce the cooling time of a portion of the corona and produce\nits condensation and accretion. We studied the interaction between fountain\nclouds and corona in different galactic environments through parsec-scale\nhydrodynamical simulations, including the presence of thermal conduction, a key\nmechanism that influences gas condensation. Our simulations showed that the\ncoronal gas condensation strongly depends on the galactic environment, in\nparticular it is less efficient for increasing virial temperature/mass of the\nhaloes where galaxies reside and it is fully ineffective for objects with\nvirial masses larger than 10^13 Msun. This result implies that the coronal gas\ncools down quickly in haloes with low-intermediate virial mass (Mvir <~ 3 x\n10^12 Msun) but the ability to cool the corona decreases going from late-type\nto early-type disc galaxies, potentially leading to the switching off of\naccretion and the quenching of star formation in massive systems.\n", "  The all-d-metal Mn2-based Heusler ferromagnetic shape memory alloys\nMn50Ni40-xCoxTi10 (x = 8 and 9.5) are realized. With a generic comparison\nbetween d-metal Ti and main-group elements in lowering the transformation\ntemperature, the magnetostructural martensitic transformations are established\nby further introducing Co to produce local ferromagnetic Mn-Co-Mn\nconfigurations. A 5-fold modulation and (3, -2) stacking of [00 10] of\nmartensite are determined by XRD and HRTEM analysis. Based on the\ntransformation, a large magneto-strain of 6900 ppm and a large volume change of\n-2.54% are observed in polycrystalline samples, which makes the all-d-metal\nmagnetic martensitic alloys of interest for magnetic/pressure multi-field\ndriven applications.\n", "  In this article, we have discussed about the scattering of charge and spin in\nspin-resolved mesoscopic systems. We have proposed a method to generate and\ndetect the entanglement of electronic spin and electronic orbital degrees of\nfreedom. It is observed that in a spin-resolved mesoscopic system, all form of\nentanglement existing between different electronic degrees of freedom can be\ngenerated. A method to detect Bell's inequality violation in terms of zero\nfrequency current cross-correlators has been mentioned. Further, we have also\nstudied the effect of quantum interference between spin flip and non-spin flip\nscattering matrices in determining the current and noise. We have obtained the\nexpression for shot noise of spin and charge current when an arbitrarily\npolarised charge current is scattered at the spin resolved potential.\n", "  Wiseman has claimed that Bell was wrong in stating that determinism was\ninferred rather than assumed in the summary of the EPR argument in his 1964\npaper. The reply of Wiseman and his co-authors to my comment misstates my\nreasons for disputing this point, and fails to address the central criticism\nthat their claim is based on a seriously flawed formalization of Bell's\nargument deriving from an unreasonably strong interpretation of the the terms,\n'influence', 'affect', and 'depend on'.\n", "  We have applied the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) method to calculate\nthe cohesive energy and the structural parameters of the binary oxides CaO,\nSrO, BaO, Sc2O3, Y2O3 and La2O3. The aim of our calculations is to\nsystematically quantify the accuracy of the DMC method to study this type of\nmetal oxides. The DMC results were compared with local, semi-local and hybrid\nDensity Functional Theory (DFT) approximations as well as with experimental\nmeasurements. The DMC method yields cohesive energies for these oxides with a\nmean absolute deviation from experimental measurements of 0.18(2) eV, while\nwith local, semi-local and hybrid DFT approximations the deviation is 3.06,\n0.94 and 1.23 eV, respectively. For lattice constants, the mean absolute\ndeviation in DMC, local, semi-local and hybrid DFT approximations, are\n0.017(1), 0.07, 0.05 and 0.04 {\\AA}, respectively. DMC is highly accurate\nmethod, outperforming the DFT approximations in describing the cohesive\nenergies and structural parameters of these binary oxides.\n", "  Among iron based superconductors, the layered iron chalcogenide Fe(Te1-xSex)\nis structurally the simplest and has attracted considerable attentions. It has\nbeen speculated from bulk studies that nanoscale inhomogeneous\nsuperconductivity may inherently exist in this system. However, this has not\nbeen directly observed from nanoscale transport measurements. In this work,\nthrough simple micromechanical exfoliation and high precision low-energy ion\nmilling thinning, we prepared Fe(Te0.5Se0.5) nano-flake with various thickness\nand systematically studied the correlation between the thickness and\nsuperconducting phase transition. Our result revealed a systematic evolution of\nsuperconducting transition with thickness. When the thickness of Fe(Te0.5Se0.5)\nflake is reduced down to 12nm, i.e. the characteristic length of Te/Se\nfluctuation, the superconducting current path and the metallicity of normal\nstate in Fe(Te0.5Se0.5) atomic sheets is suppressed. This observation provides\nthe first direct transport evidence for the nano-scale inhomogeneous nature of\nsuperconductivity in Fe(Te1-xSex).\n", "  (Translated Title: Development of a positron gas moderator) In this work a\npositron moderator that is based on inelastic positron scattering in nitrogen\ngas has been developed and set-up. A positron beam enters a gas cell through a\nsmall aperture. In the cell the positrons lose kinetic energy through\ncollisions with the nitrogen molecules. By means of an electric field the\npositrons are then focused towards an exit where their kinetic energy is\nanalysed. During measurements at the NEPOMUC beam moderated positrons could be\nobserved.\n  -----\n  Im Rahmen dieser Diplomarbeit wurde das Konzept eines Moderators f\\\"ur\nPositronen untersucht, welches auf der Abbremsung und dem Drift von Positronen\nin gasf\\\"ormigem Stickstoff beruht. Dazu wurde ein Versuchsaufbau konstruiert,\naufgebaut und in Betrieb genommen. Ein Positronenstrahl wird durch eine kleine\nBlende in eine Gaszelle eingekoppelt, dort durch St\\\"o{\\ss}e mit den\nGasmolek\\\"ulen abgebremst, durch ein elektrisches Feld auf den Ausgang\nfokussiert und dahinter analysiert. Durch ausf\\\"uhrliche Simulationen mit dem\nProgramm Simion 3D konnte das elektrische Feld im Inneren der Gaszelle\noptimiert werden. Zur Untersuchung der Energie der moderierten Positronen wurde\nein Bremsspannungsanalysator angefertigt und am Ausgang der Zelle installiert.\nDie Lokalisierung der im Versuchsaufbau zerstrahlenden Positronen wurde durch\nzwei in Koinzidenz geschaltete Gammadetektoren erm\\\"oglicht, welche gegen\\\"uber\nliegend l\\\"angs des Moderators auf Schienen verfahrbar waren.\n", "  We develop the particle-in-cell (PIC) code KLAPS to include the photon\ngeneration via the Compton scattering and electron-positron creation via the\nBreit-Wheeler process due to quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects. We compare\ntwo sets of existing formulas for the photon generation and different Monte\nCarlo algorithms. Then we benchmark the PIC simulation results.\n", "  A droplet of surfactant spreading on an ultrasoft ($E \\lesssim 100$ Pa) gel\nsubstrate will produce capillary fractures at the gel surface; these fractures\noriginate at the contact-line and propagate outwards in a starburst pattern.\nThere is an inherent variability in both the number of fractures formed and the\ntime delay before fractures form. In the regime where single fractures form, we\nobserve a Weibull-like distribution of delay times, consistent with a\nthermally-activated process. The shape parameter is close to 1 for softer gels\n(a Poisson process), and larger for stiffer gels (indicative of aging). For\nsingle fractures, the characteristic delay time is primarily set by the\nelastocapillary length of the system, calculated from the differential in\nsurface tension between the droplet and the substrate, rather than the elastic\nmodulus as for stiffer systems. For multiple fractures, all fractures appear\nsimultaneously and long delay times are suppressed. The delay time distribution\nprovides a new technique for probing the energy landscape and fracture\ntoughness of ultrasoft materials.\n", "  We have introduced a semi-automated quantitative method to estimate the age\nand reddening of 1072 star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using\nthe Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) III survey data. This study\nbrings out 308 newly parameterised clusters. In a first of its kind, the LMC\nclusters are classified into groups based on richness/mass as very poor, poor,\nmoderate and rich clusters, similar to the classification scheme of open\nclusters in the Galaxy. A major cluster formation episode is found to happen at\n125 +- 25 Myr in the inner LMC. The bar region of the LMC appears prominently\nin the age range 60 - 250 Myr and is found to have a relatively higher\nconcentration of poor and moderate clusters. The eastern and the western ends\nof the bar are found to form clusters initially, which later propagates to the\ncentral part. We demonstrate that there is a significant difference in the\ndistribution of clusters as a function of mass, using a movie based on the\npropagation (in space and time) of cluster formation in various groups. The\nimportance of including the low mass clusters in the cluster formation history\nis demonstrated. The catalog with parameters, classification, and cleaned and\nisochrone fitted CMDs of 1072 clusters, which are available as online material,\ncan be further used to understand the hierarchical formation of clusters in\nselected regions of the LMC.\n", "  We report the first measurement of the $\\tau$ lepton polarization in the\ndecay ${\\bar B} \\rightarrow D^* \\tau^- {\\bar\\nu_{\\tau}}$ as well as a new\nmeasurement of the ratio of the branching fractions $R(D^{*}) =\n\\mathcal{B}({\\bar B} \\rightarrow D^* \\tau^- {\\bar\\nu_{\\tau}}) /\n\\mathcal{B}({\\bar B} \\rightarrow D^* \\ell^- {\\bar\\nu_{\\ell}})$, where $\\ell^-$\ndenotes an electron or a muon, with the decays $\\tau^- \\rightarrow \\pi^-\n\\nu_{\\tau}$ and $\\tau^- \\rightarrow \\rho^- \\nu_{\\tau}$. We use the full data\nsample of $772 \\times 10^6$ $B{\\bar B}$ pairs accumulated with the Belle\ndetector at the KEKB electron-positron collider. Our preliminary results,\n$R(D^*) = 0.276 \\pm 0.034{\\rm (stat.)} ^{+0.029} _{-0.026}{\\rm (syst.)}$ and\n$P_{\\tau} = -0.44 \\pm 0.47 {\\rm (stat.)} ^{+0.20} _{-0.17} {\\rm (syst.)}$, are\nconsistent with the theoretical predictions of the Standard Model within $0.6$\nstandard deviation.\n", "  Event generators play a crucial role in the exploration of LHC physics. This\npresentation summarizes news and plans for the three general-purpose pp\ngenerators HERWIG, PYTHIA and SHERPA, as well as briefer notes on a few other\ngenerators. Common themes, such as the matching and merging between matrix\nelements and parton showers, are highlighted. Other topics include a historical\nintroduction, from the Lund perspective, and comments on the role of MCnet.\n", "  We have designed and developed a compact ultraviolet imaging payload to fly\non a range of possible platforms such as high altitude balloon experiments,\ncubesats, space missions, etc. The primary science goals are to study the\nbright UV sources (mag < 10) and also to look for transients in the Near UV\n(200 - 300 nm) domain. Our first choice is to place this instrument on a\nspacecraft going to the Moon as part of the Indian entry into Google lunar\nX-Prize competition. The major constraints for the instrument are, it should be\nlightweight (< 2Kg), compact (length < 50cm) and cost effective. The instrument\nis an 80 mm diameter Cassegrain telescope with a field of view of around half a\ndegree designated for UV imaging. In this paper we will discuss about the\nvarious science cases that can be performed by having observations with the\ninstrument on different platforms. We will also describe the design,\ndevelopment and the current state of implementation of the instrument. This\nincludes opto-mechanical and electrical design of the instrument. We have\nadopted an all spherical optical design which would make the system less\ncomplex to realize and a cost effective solution compared to other telescope\nconfiguration. The structural design has been chosen in such a way that it will\nensure that the instrument could withstand all the launch load vibrations. An\nFPGA based electronics board is used for the data acquisition, processing and\nCCD control. We will also briefly discuss about the hardware implementation of\nthe detector interface and algorithms for the detector readout and data\nprocessing.\n", "  Simulations of the generation of the atomic polarization is necessary for\ninterpreting the second solar spectrum. For this purpose, it is important to\nrigorously determine the effects of the isotropic collisions with neutral\nhydrogen on the atomic polarization of the neutral atoms, ionized atoms and\nmolecules. Our aim is to treat in generality the problem of depolarizing\nisotropic collisions between singly ionized atoms and neutral hydrogen in its\nground state. Using our numerical code, we computed the collisional\ndepolarization rates of the $p$-levels of ions for large number of values of\nthe effective principal quantum number $n^{*}$ and the Uns\\\"old energy $E_p$.\nThen, genetic programming has been utilized to fit the available depolarization\nrates. As a result, strongly non-linear relationships between the collisional\ndepolarization rates, $n^{*}$ and $E_p$ are obtained, and are shown to\nreproduce the original data with accuracy clearly better than 10\\%. These\nrelationships allow quick calculations of the depolarizing collisional rates of\nany simple ion which is very useful for the solar physics community. In\naddition, the depolarization rates associated to the complex ions and to the\nhyperfine levels can be easily derived from our results. In this work we have\nshown that by using powerful numerical approach and our collisional method,\ngeneral model giving the depolarization of the ions can be obtained to be\nexploited for solar applications.\n", "  We study intermittency as a departure from self-similarity of the solar wind\nmagnetic turbulence and investigate the evolution with the heliocentric\ndistance and latitude. We use data from the Ulysses spacecraft measured during\ntwo solar minima (1997-1998 and 2007-2008) and one solar maximum (1999-2001).\nIn particular, by modeling a multifractal spectrum, we revealed the\nintermittent character of turbulence in the small-scale fluctuations of the\nmagnetic field embedded in the slow and fast solar wind. Generally, at small\ndistances from the Sun, in both the slow and fast solar wind, we observe the\nhigh degree of multifractality (intermittency) that decreases somewhat slowly\nwith distance and slowly with latitude. The obtained results seem to suggest\nthat generally intermittency in the solar wind has a solar origin. However, the\nfast and slow streams, shocks, and other nonlinear interactions can only be\nconsidered as the drivers of the intermittent turbulence. It seems that\nanalysis shows that turbulence beyond the ecliptic plane evolves too slowly to\nmaintain the intermittency with the distance and latitude. Moreover, we confirm\nthat the multifractality and intermittency are at a lower level than in the\necliptic, as well as the existence of symmetry with respect to the ecliptic\nplane, suggesting that there are similar turbulent properties observed in the\ntwo hemispheres.\n", "  We consider the ${\\cal N}=1$ $SU(N_c)$ SQCD-like (direct) theory (and its\nSeiberg's dual with $SU(N_F-N_c)$ dual colors), and with $N_F$ flavors of light\nquarks ${\\overline Q}_j, Q^i$ with the mass term in the superpotential $m_Q{\\rm\nTr}({\\overline Q} Q),\\,\\, m_Q\\ll\\Lambda$. Besides, there are $N_F^2$ additional\ncolorless but flavored fields $\\Phi^j_i$ with the large mass parameter\n$\\mu_{\\Phi}\\gg\\Lambda$. But now considered is the region $N_c+1<N_F<3N_c/2$\nwhere the UV free direct $SU(N_c)$ theory is strongly coupled at scales\n$\\mu<\\Lambda$.\n  The mass spectra of this direct theory in various vacua and at different\nvalues of $\\mu_{\\Phi}$ are calculated within the dynamical scenario introduced\nby the author in [9]. This scenario assumes that quarks in such ${\\cal N}=1$\nSQCD-like theories can be in two standard phases only. These are either the HQ\n(heavy quark) phase where they are confined or the Higgs phase.\n  It is shown that due to the strong powerlike RG evolution, the seemingly\nheavy and dynamically irrelevant at scales $\\mu<\\Lambda$ fields $\\Phi^j_i$ can\nbecome light and relevant at lower energies, and there appear then two\nadditional generation of light $\\Phi$-particles with masses $\\mu^{\\rm\npole}(\\Phi)\\ll\\Lambda$.\n  The calculated mass spectra of this strongly coupled at $\\mu<\\Lambda\\,\nSU(N_c)$ theory are compared to those of its weakly coupled at $\\mu<\\Lambda$\nSeiberg's dual $SU(N_F-N_c)$ variant and appeared to be parametrically\ndifferent. It is worth to recall that the dynamical scenario from [9] used in\nthis article satisfies all those tests which were used as checks of the Seiberg\nhypothesis about the equivalence of the direct and dual theories. This\nparametrical difference shows, in particular, that all these tests, although\nnecessary, may well be insufficient.\n", "  Based on the simple phenomenological $\\sigma \\pi \\pi$, $\\sigma N N$ and $\\pi\n\\pi \\gamma$ interactions, we estimate the $\\sigma$ exchange effect in the Lamb\nshift of muonic hydrogen. We at first calculate the effective couplings of\n$\\sigma\\mu\\mu$ by two photons and two pions exchange, then calculate the\ncorresponding corrections to the energy shift of the 2S/2P states of muonic\nhydrogen. We find the correction to the energy shift of 2S state is about\n-14$\\mu$eV by the current used parameters, which is about $44\\%$ of the usual\ntwo photons exchange contribution, and is larger than the current experimental\nprecision, and should be considered in the experimental analysis.\n", "  We review our recent work on the gauge-invariant non-local dimension-two\noperator $A^2_{\\rm min}$, whose minimization is defined along the gauge orbit.\nAlbeit non-local, the operator $A^2_{\\rm min}$ can be cast in local form\nthrough the introduction of an auxiliary Stueckelberg field. The whole\nprocedure results into a local action which turns out to be renormalizable to\nall orders.\n", "  We investigate the scalar-wave resonances of systems composed of identical\nNeumann-type inclusions arranged periodically around a circular ring. Drawing\non natural similarities with the undamped Rayleigh-Bloch waves supported by\ninfinite linear arrays, we deduce asymptotically the exponentially small\nradiative damping in the limit where the ring radius is large relative to the\nperiodicity. In our asymptotic approach, locally linear Rayleigh-Bloch waves\nthat attenuate exponentially away from the ring are matched to a ring-scale\nWKB-type wave field. The latter provides a descriptive physical picture of how\nthe mode energy is transferred via tunnelling to a circular\nevanescent-to-propagating transition region a finite distance away from the\nring, from where radiative grazing rays emanate to the far field. Excluding the\nzeroth-order standing-wave modes, the position of the transition circle\nbifurcates with respect to clockwise and anti-clockwise contributions,\nresulting in striking spiral wavefronts.\n", "  We present new, high-quality multicolor observations of four recently\ndiscovered contact binaries: 1SWASP J064501.21+342154.9, 1SWASP\nJ155822.10-025604.8, 1SWASP J212808.86+151622.0, and UCAC4 436-062932, and\nanalyze their light curves to determine orbital and physical parameters using\nthe modeling program of G. Djura\\v{s}evi\\'c. In the absence of spectroscopic\nobservations, the effective temperatures of the brighter components are\nestimated from the color indices, and the mass ratios are determined with the\nq-search method. The analysis shows that all four systems are W UMa type\nbinaries in shallow contact configurations, consisting of late-type\nmain-sequence primaries and evolved secondaries with active surface regions\n(dark or bright spots) resulting from magnetic activity or ongoing transfer of\nthermal energy between the components. We compare the derived orbital and\nstellar parameters for these four variables with a large sample of previously\nanalyzed W UMa stars and find that our results fit it well.\n", "  Wide Field Adaptive Optics (WFAO) systems represent the more sophisticated AO\nsystems available today at large telescopes. A critical aspect for these WFAO\nsystems in order to deliver an optimised performance is the knowledge of the\nvertical spatiotemporal distribution of the CN2 and the wind speed. Previous\nstudies (Cortes et al., 2012) already proved the ability of GeMS (the Gemini\nMulti-Conjugated AO system) in retrieving CN2 and wind vertical stratification\nusing the telemetry data. To assess the reliability of the GeMS wind speed\nestimates a preliminary study (Neichel et al., 2014) compared wind speed\nretrieved from GeMS with that obtained with the atmospherical model Meso-Nh on\na small sample of nights providing promising results. The latter technique is\nvery reliable for the wind speed vertical stratification. The model outputs\ngave, indeed, an excellent agreement with a large sample of radiosoundings (~\n50) both in statistical terms and on individual flights (Masciadri et al.,\n2013). Such a tool can therefore be used as a valuable reference in this\nexercise of cross calibrating GeMS on-sky wind estimates with model\npredictions. In this contribution we achieved a two-fold results: (1) we\nextended analysis on a much richer statistical sample (~ 43 nights), we\nconfirmed the preliminary results and we found an even better correlation\nbetween GeMS observations and the atmospherical model with basically no cases\nof not-negligible uncertainties; (2) we evaluate the possibility to use, as an\ninput for GeMS, the Meso-Nh estimates of the wind speed stratification in an\noperational configuration. Under this configuration these estimates can be\nprovided many hours in advanced with respect to the observations and with a\nvery high temporal frequency (order of 2 minutes or less).\n", "  Small-angle neutron scattering on high quality single crystalline\nBa$_{1-x}$K$_{x}$Fe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ reveals the transition from a low--field\nvortex solid phase with orientational order to a vortex polycrystal at high\nmagnetic field. The vortex order-disorder transition is correlated with the\nsecond-peak feature in isothermal hysteresis loops, and is interpreted in terms\nof the generation of supplementary vortex solid dislocations. The sharp drop of\nthe structure factor above the second peak field is explained by the dynamics\nof freezing of the vortex ensemble in the high field phase.\n", "  In earlier papers, techniques have been described using optical chronographs\nto determine free flight drag coefficients with an accuracy of 1-2%,\naccomplished by measuring near and far velocities of projectiles in flight over\na known distance. Until recently, Doppler radar has been prohibitively\nexpensive for many users. This paper reports results of exploring potential\napplications and accuracy using a recently available, inexpensive (< $600 US)\namateur Doppler radar system to determine drag coefficients for projectiles of\nvarious sizes (4.4 mm to 9 mm diameter) and speeds (M0.3 to M3.0). In many\ncases, drag coefficients can be determined with an accuracy of 1% or better if\nsignal-to-noise ratio is sufficient and projectiles vary little between trials.\nIt is also straightforward to design experiments for determining drag over a\nwide range of velocities. Experimental approaches and limitations are\ndescribed. Overall, the amateur radar system shows greater accuracy, ease of\nuse, and simplicity compared with optical chronographs. Doppler radar has\nadvantages of working well with less accurate projectiles without putting\nequipment at risk of projectile impact downrange. The system can also detect\nphenomena that optical chronographs cannot, such as projectile instability\nresulting in tumbling in flight. This technology may be useful in introductory\nphysics labs, aerodynamics labs, and for accurately determining drag and\nballistic coefficients of projectiles used in military, law enforcement, and\nsporting applications. The most significant limitations are reduced\nsignal-to-noise with smaller projectiles (< 5 mm diameter) and inability to\ndetect projectiles more than 100 m down range.\n", "  Burst-like events with signatures in the UV are often observed co-spatial to\nstrong line-of-sight photospheric magnetic fields. Several authors, for\nexample, have noted the spatial relationship between Ellerman bombs (EBs) and\nMoving Magnetic Features (MMFs), regions of flux which disconnect from a\nsunspot or pore before propagating away in the moat flow and often displaying\nevidence of cancellation. In this article, data collected by the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly\nare analysed in an attempt to understand the potential links between such\ncancellation and UV burst formation. Two MMFs from AR 11579, three bi-poles\nfrom AR 11765, and six bi-poles (four of which were co-spatial to IRIS bursts)\nin AR 11850 were identified for analysis. All of these cancellation features\nwere found to have lifetimes of the order hours and cancellation rates of the\norder 10^14-10^15 Mx s^-1. H-alpha line wing data from the Dunn Solar\nTelescope's Interferometric BIdimensional Spectrometer were also available for\nAR 11579 facilitating a discussion of links between MMFs and EBs. Using an\nalgebraic model of photospheric magnetic reconnection, the measured\ncancellation rates are then used to ascertain estimates of certain quantities\n(such as up-flow speeds, jet extents, and potential energy releases) which\ncompared reasonably to the properties of EBs reported within the literature.\nOur results suggest that cancellation rates of the order measured here are\ncapable of supplying enough energy to drive certain UV bursts (including EBs),\nhowever, they are not a guaranteeing condition for burst formation.\n", "  In this contribution we present the most relevant results obtained in the\ncontext of a feasibility study (MOSE) undertaken for ESO. The principal aim of\nthe project was to quantify the performances of a mesoscale model\n(Astro-Meso-NH code) in forecasting all the main atmospherical parameters\nrelevant for the ground-based astronomical observations and the optical\nturbulence (CN2 and associated integrated astroclimatic parameters) above Cerro\nParanal (site of the VLT) and Cerro Armazones (site of the E-ELT). A detailed\nanalysis on the score of success of the predictive capacities of the system\nhave been carried out for all the astroclimatic as well as for the\natmospherical parameters. Considering the excellent results that we obtained,\nthis study proved the opportunity to implement on these two sites an automatic\nsystem to be run nightly in an operational configuration to support the\nscheduling of scientific programs as well as of astronomical facilities\n(particularly those supported by AO systems) of the VLT and the E-ELT. At the\nend of 2016 a new project for the implementation of a demonstrator of an\noperational system to be run on the two ESO's sites will start. Our team is\nalso responsible for the implementation of a similar automatic system at\nMt.Graham, site of the LBT (ALTA Project). Our system/method will permit\ntherefore to make a step ahead in the framework of the Service Mode for new\ngeneration telescopes. Among the most exciting achieved results we cite the\nfact that we proved to be able to forecast CN2 profiles with a vertical\nresolution as high as 150 m. Such a feature is particularly crucial for all\nWFAO systems that require such detailed information on the OT vertical\nstratification on the whole 20 km above the ground. This important achievement\ntells us that all the WFAO systems can rely on automatic systems that are able\nto support their optimized use.\n", "  We present the results of a closure phase analysis of 3 mm very long baseline\ninterferometry (VLBI) measurements performed on Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). We\nhave analyzed observations made in May 2015 using the Very Long Baseline Array,\nthe Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope and the Large Millimeter Telescope\nAlfonso Serrano and obtained non-zero closure phase measurements on several\nstation triangles - indicative of a non-point-symmetric source structure. The\ndata are fitted with an asymmetric source structure model in Sgr A*,\nrepresented by a simple two-component model, which favours a fainter component\ndue East of the main source. This result is discussed in light of a scattering\nscreen with substructure or an intrinsically asymmetric source.\n", "  Using the wealth of ~24 yr multiband data, we present an in-depth study of\nthe star-spot cycles, surface differential rotations (SDR), optical flares,\nevolution of star-spot distributions, and coronal activities on the surface of\nyoung, single, main-sequence, ultrafast rotator (UFR) LO Peg. From the\nlong-term V -band photometry, we derive rotational period of LO Peg to be\n0.4231 +/- 0.0001 d. Using the seasonal variations on the rotational period,\nthe SDR pattern is investigated, and shows a solar-like pattern of SDR. A\ncyclic pattern with period of ~2.7 yr appears to be present in rotational\nperiod variation. During the observations, 20 optical flares are detected with\na flare frequency of 1 flare per two days and with flare energy of 10^{31-34}\nerg. The surface coverage of cool spots is found to be in the range of 9-26 per\ncent. It appears that the high- and low-latitude spots are interchanging their\npositions. Quasi-simultaneous observations in X-ray, UV, and optical\nphotometric bands show a signature of an excess of X-ray and UV activities in\nspotted regions.\n", "  I review few conceptual steps in analytic description of topological\ninteractions, which constitute the basis of a new interdisciplinary branch in\nmathematical physics, \"Statistical Topology\", emerged at the edge of topology\nand statistical physics of fluctuating non-phantom rope-like objects. This new\nbranch is called statistical (or probabilistic) topology.\n", "  Building on the comprehensive White Paper on the scientific case for\nmulti-object spectroscopy on the European ELT, we present the top-level\ninstrument requirements that are being used in the Phase A design study of the\nMOSAIC concept. The assembled cases span the full range of E-ELT science and\ngenerally require either 'high multiplex' or 'high definition' observations to\nbest exploit the excellent sensitivity and spatial performance of the\ntelescope. We highlight some of the science studies that are now being used in\ntrade-off studies to inform the capabilities of MOSAIC and its technical\ndesign.\n", "  In ensemble teacher learning, ensemble teachers have only uncertain\ninformation about the true teacher, and this information is given by an\nensemble consisting of an infinite number of ensemble teachers whose variety is\nsufficiently rich. In this learning, a student learns from an ensemble teacher\nthat is iteratively selected randomly from a pool of many ensemble teachers. An\ninteresting point of ensemble teacher learning is the asymptotic behavior of\nthe student to approach the true teacher by learning from ensemble teachers.\nThe student performance is improved by using the Hebbian learning rule in the\nlearning. However, the perceptron learning rule cannot improve the student\nperformance. On the other hand, we proposed a perceptron learning rule with a\nmargin. This learning rule is identical to the perceptron learning rule when\nthe margin is zero and identical to the Hebbian learning rule when the margin\nis infinity. Thus, this rule connects the perceptron learning rule and the\nHebbian learning rule continuously through the size of the margin. Using this\nrule, we study changes in the learning behavior from the perceptron learning\nrule to the Hebbian learning rule by considering several margin sizes. From the\nresults, we show that by setting a margin of kappa > 0, the effect of an\nensemble appears and becomes significant when a larger margin kappa is used.\n", "  Pulsed cathodoluminescence (PCL) spectra of ultra-pure SiO2, GeO2, SnO2,\nTiO2, La2O3, Y2O3, Sc2O3, CaCO3 powders and {\\alpha}-quartz, Ca:YVO4, LiNbO3\nand Sc:LiNbO3 crystals were studied under the same experimental conditions. It\nwas found that PCL spectra of SiO2, SnO2, GeO2, TiO2, La2O3 and CaCO3 powders\ncontain a common band with maximum intensity at 500 nm, PCL spectra of samples\nY2O3, Sc2O3, PbWO4 and Ca:YVO4 contain a common band at 490 nm and PCL spectra\nof LiNbO3 and Sc:LiNbO3 crystals contain a common band at 507 nm. It was found\nthat the average intensity of the PCL spectra and position of the maximum\nintensity of these common bands depend on the type of a band gap transition of\nthe material. We suppose that these common bands have the same origin in PCL\nspectra of all the materials studied and are related to recombination of\nO2--O-oxygen complexes. These complexes appear in the vicinities of anionic and\ncationic vacancies, where the geometry and orientation of coordination\npolyhedrons are violated due to the stress in the lattice.\n", "  The goal of this paper is to advance mathematical and computational\nmethodology for orbiter-to-orbiter radio tomography of small planetary objects.\nIn this study, an advanced full waveform forward model is coupled with a total\nvariation based inversion technique. We use a satellite formation model in\nwhich a single unit receives a signal that is transmitted by one or more\ntransponder satellites. Numerical results for a 2D domain are presented.\n", "  Light scalar mesons can be understood as dynamically generated resonances.\nThey arise as 'companion poles' in the propagators of quark-antiquark seed\nstates when accounting for hadronic loop contributions to the self-energies of\nthe latter. Such a mechanism may explain the overpopulation in the scalar\nsector - there exist more resonances with total spin $J=0$ than can be\ndescribed within a quark model.\n  Along this line, we study an effective Lagrangian approach where the\nisovector state $a_{0}(1450)$ couples via both non-derivative and derivative\ninteractions to pseudoscalar mesons. It is demonstrated that the propagator has\ntwo poles: a companion pole corresponding to $a_{0}(980)$ and a pole of the\nseed state $a_{0}(1450)$. The positions of these poles are in quantitative\nagreement with experimental data. Besides that, we investigate similar models\nfor the isodoublet state $K_{0}^{\\ast}(1430)$ by performing a fit to $\\pi K$\nphase shift data in the $I=1/2,$ $J=0$ channel. We show that, in order to fit\nthe data accurately, a companion pole for the $K_{0}^{\\ast}(800)$, that is, the\nlight $\\kappa$, is required. A large-$N_{c}$ study confirms that both\nresonances below $1$ GeV are predominantly four-quark states, while the heavy\nstates are quarkonia.\n", "  This note describes the functional-integral quantization of two-dimensional\ntopological field theories together with applications to problems in\ndeformation quantization of Poisson manifolds and reduction of certain\nsubmanifolds. A brief introduction to smooth graded manifolds and to the\nBatalin-Vilkovisky formalism is included.\n", "  In this document we study the effect of anomalous Higgs boson couplings on\nnon-resonant pair production of Higgs bosons ($HH$) at the LHC. We explore the\nspace of the five parameters $\\kappa_{\\lambda}$, $\\kappa_{t}$, $c_2$, $c_g$,\nand $c_{2g}$ in terms of the corresponding kinematics of the final state, and\ndescribe a partition of the space into a limited number of regions featuring\nsimilar phenomenology in the kinematics of $HH$ final state. We call clusters\nthe sets of points belonging to the same region; to each cluster corresponds a\nrepresentative point which we call a benchmark. We discuss a possible technique\nto estimate the sensitivity of an experimental search to the kinematical\ndifferences between the phenomenology of the benchmark points and the rest of\nthe parameter space contained in the corresponding cluster. We also provide an\nanalytical parametrization of the cross-section modifications that the\nvariation of anomalous couplings produces with respect to standard model $HH$\nproduction along with a recipe to translate the results into other\nparameter-space bases. Finally, we provide a preliminary analysis of variations\nin the topology of the final state within each region based on recent LHC\nresults.\n", "  We report a detailed magneto-transport study in single crystals of NbP. High\nquality crystals were grown by vapour transport method. An exceptionally large\nmagnetoresistance is confirmed at low temperature which is non-saturating and\nis linear at high fields. Models explaining the linear magnetoresistance are\ndiscussed and it is argued that in NbP this is linked to charge carrier\nmobility fluctuations. Negative longitudinal magnetoresistance is not seen,\nunlike several other Weyl monopnictides, suggesting lack of well defined chiral\nanomaly in NbP. Unambiguous Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations are observed at low\ntemperatures that are correlated to Berry phases. The Landau fan diagram\nindicates trivial Berry phase in NbP crystals corresponding to Fermi surface\nextrema at 30.5 Tesla.\n", "  In this comment we propose a novel explanation for the Leonardo's rule\nconcerning the tree branching. According to Leonardo's notebooks he observed\nthat if one observes the branches of a tree, the squared radius of the\nprincipal branch is equal to the sum of the squared radius of the branch\ndaughters.\n", "  Computing set joins of two inputs is a common task in database theory.\nRecently, Van Gucht, Williams, Woodruff and Zhang [PODS 2015] considered the\ncomplexity of such problems in the natural model of (classical) two-party\ncommunication complexity and obtained tight bounds for the complexity of\nseveral important distributed set joins.\n  In this paper we initiate the study of the *quantum* communication complexity\nof distributed set joins. We design a quantum protocol for distributed Boolean\nmatrix multiplication, which corresponds to computing the composition join of\ntwo databases, showing that the product of two $n\\times n$ Boolean matrices,\neach owned by one of two respective parties, can be computed with\n$\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{n}\\ell^{3/4})$ qubits of communication, where $\\ell$\ndenotes the number of non-zero entries of the product. Since Van Gucht et al.\nshowed that the classical communication complexity of this problem is\n$\\widetilde{\\Theta}(n\\sqrt{\\ell})$, our quantum algorithm outperforms classical\nprotocols whenever the output matrix is sparse. We also show a quantum lower\nbound and a matching classical upper bound on the communication complexity of\ndistributed matrix multiplication over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n  Besides their applications to database theory, the communication complexity\nof set joins is interesting due to its connections to direct product theorems\nin communication complexity. In this work we also introduce a notion of\n*all-pairs* product theorem, and relate this notion to standard direct product\ntheorems in communication complexity.\n", "  We consider a variant of Hybrid Inflation, where inflation is driven by two\ninteracting scalar fields, one of which has a `Mexican hat' potential and the\nother a quartic potential. Given the appropriate initial conditions one of the\nfields can be trapped in a false vacuum state, supported by couplings to the\nother field. The energy of this vacuum can be used to drive inflation, which\nends when the vacuum decays to one of its true minima. Depending on parameters,\nit is possible for inflation to proceed via two separate epochs, with the\npotential temporarily steepening sufficiently to suspend inflation. We use\nnumerical simulations to analyse the possibilities, and emphasise the\nshortcomings of the slow-roll approximation for analysing this scenario. We\nalso calculate the density perturbations produced, which can have a spectral\nindex greater than one.\n", "  There are good reasons to consider models of low-energy supersymmetry with\nvery light photinos and gluinos. In a wide class of models the lightest\n$R$-odd, color-singlet state containing a gluino, the $\\r0$, has a mass in the\n1-2 GeV range and the slightly lighter photino, $\\pho$, would survive as the\nrelic $R$-odd species. For the light photino masses considered here, previous\ncalculations resulted in an unacceptable photino relic abundance. But we point\nout that processes other than photino self-annihilation determine the relic\nabundance when the photino and $R^0$ are close in mass. Including\n$\\r0\\longleftrightarrow\\pho$ processes, we find that the photino relic\nabundance is most sensitive to the $\\r0$-to-$\\pho$ mass ratio, and within model\nuncertainties, a critical density in photinos may be obtained for an\n$\\r0$-to-$\\pho$ mass ratio in the range 1.2 to 2.2. We propose photinos in the\nmass range of 500 MeV to 1.6 GeV as a dark matter candidate, and discuss a\nstrategy to test the hypothesis.\n", "  We compute the angular power spectrum of temperature anisotropies on the\nmicrowave sky in the cosmic texture theory, with standard recombination\nassumed. The spectrum shows `Doppler' peaks analogous to those in scenarios\nbased on primordial adiabatic fluctuations such as `standard CDM', but at quite\ndifferent angular scales. There appear to be excellent prospects for using this\nas a discriminant between inflationary and cosmic defect theories.\n", "  We study the effect that quantum fluctuations produced during the nucleation\nof a single-bubble open inflationary universe have on the amplitude of\ntemperature anisotropies in the microwave background. We compute the instanton\naction for the quantum tunneling between the false and true vacua in open\ninflation models and show that the amplitude of quantum fluctuations of the\nbubble wall is very sensitive to the gravitational effects of the true vacuum.\nWe study the spectrum of quantum fluctuations of the bubble wall and confirm\nthat there is only an inhomogeneous ($k^2 = -3$) discrete mode associated with\ntransverse traceless fluctuations of the bubble wall. This super-curvature mode\ncould in principle distort the anisotropy of the microwave background. We\ncompute the amplitude of the gauge invariant metric perturbations induced by\nthe bubble wall fluctuations on a comoving hypersurface, and calculate the\ninduced amplitude of temperature fluctuations in the microwave background, for\narbitrary values of $\\Omega_0$. We find that in the limit $\\Omega_0\\simeq 1$,\nthe quadrupole dominates the angular power spectrum, like in the usual\nGrishchuk-Zel'dovich effect. The resulting bounds on the amplitude of quantum\nfluctuations of the bubble wall from the absence of such an effect in the\nobserved microwave background anisotropies are quite strong. We also study the\ncontribution from a discrete long wavelength super-curvature mode ($k^2 \\simeq\n2m^2/3H^2$) that appears in the spectrum of open de Sitter vacuum fluctuations.\nWe constrain the parameters of the models of open inflation so that these modes\ndo not distort the observed temperature anisotropy.\n", "  We study the metric perturbations produced during inflation in models with\ntwo scalar fields evolving simultaneously. In particular, we emphasize how the\nlarge-scale curvature perturbation $\\zeta$ on fixed energy density\nhypersurfaces may not be conserved in general for multiple field inflation due\nto the presence of entropy as well as adiabatic fluctuations. We show that the\nusual method of solving the linearized perturbation equations is equivalent to\nthe recently proposed analysis of Sasaki and Stewart in terms of the perturbed\nexpansion along neighboring trajectories in field-space. In the case of a\nseparable potential it is possible to compute in the slow-roll approximation\nthe spectrum of density perturbations and gravitational waves at the end of\ninflation. In general there is an inequality between the ratio of tensor to\nscalar perturbations and the tilt of the gravitational wave spectrum, which\nbecomes an equality when only adiabatic perturbations are possible and $\\zeta$\nis conserved.\n", "  Interferometric gravitational wave detectors could measure the frequency\nsweep of a binary inspiral [characterized by its chirp mass] to high accuracy.\nThe observed chirp mass is the intrinsic chirp mass of the binary source\nmultiplied by $(1+z)$, where $z$ is the redshift of the source. Assuming a\nnon-zero cosmological constant, we compute the expected redshift distribution\nof observed events for an advanced LIGO detector. We find that the redshift\ndistribution has a robust and sizable dependence on the cosmological constant;\nthe data from advanced LIGO detectors could provide an independent measurement\nof the cosmological constant.\n", "  Neutrino-nucleus elastic scattering is reduced in dense matter because of\ncorrelations between ions. The static structure factor for a plasma of\nelectrons and ions is calculated from Monte Carlo simulations and parameterized\nwith a least squares fit. Our results imply a large increase in the neutrino\nmean free path. This strongly limits the trapping of neutrinos in a supernova\nby coherent neutral current interactions.\n"]}
