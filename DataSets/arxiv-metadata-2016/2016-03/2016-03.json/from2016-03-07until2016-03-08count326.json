This paper reports an application of gas-kinetic BGK scheme to the\ncomputation of turbulent compressible convection in the stellar interior. After\nincorporating the Sub-grid Scale (SGS) turbulence model into the BGK scheme, we\ntested the effects of numerical parameters on the quantitative relationships\namong the thermodynamic variables, their fluctuations and correlations in a\nvery deep, initially gravity-stratified stellar atmosphere. Comparison\nindicates that the thermal properties and dynamic properties are dominated by\ndifferent aspects of numerical models separately. An adjustable Deardorff\nconstant in the SGS model $c_\\mu=0.25$ and an amplitude of artificial viscosity\nin the gas-kinetic BGK scheme $C_2=0$ are appropriate for current study. We\nalso calculated the density-weighted auto- and cross-correlation functions in\nXiong's (\\cite{xiong77}) turbulent stellar convection theories based on which\nthe gradient type of models of the non-local transport and the anisotropy of\nthe turbulence are preliminarily studied. No universal relations or constant\nparameters were found for these models.\n", "  In this paper we have improved the semiclassical analysis of loop quantum\nblack hole (LQBH) in the conservative approach of constant polymeric parameter.\nIn particular we have focused our attention on the space-time structure. We\nhave introduced a very simple modification of the spherically symmetric\nHamiltonian constraint in its holonomic version. The new quantum constraint\nreduces to the classical constraint when the polymeric parameter goes to\nzero.Using this modification we have obtained a large class of semiclassical\nsolutions parametrized by a generic function of the polymeric parameter. We\nhave found that only a particular choice of this function reproduces the black\nhole solution with the correct asymptotic flat limit. In r=0 the semiclassical\nmetric is regular and the Kretschmann invariant has a maximum peaked in\nL-Planck. The radial position of the pick does not depend on the black hole\nmass and the polymeric parameter. The semiclassical solution is very similar to\nthe Reissner-Nordstrom metric. We have constructed the Carter-Penrose diagrams\nexplicitly, giving a causal description of the space-time and its maximal\nextension. The LQBH metric interpolates between two asymptotically flat\nregions, the r to infinity region and the r to 0 region. We have studied the\nthermodynamics of the semiclassical solution. The temperature, entropy and the\nevaporation process are regular and could be defined independently from the\npolymeric parameter. We have studied the particular metric when the polymeric\nparameter goes towards to zero. This metric is regular in r=0 and has only one\nevent horizon in r = 2m. The Kretschmann invariant maximum depends only on\nL-Planck. The polymeric parameter does not play any role in the black hole\nsingularity resolution. The thermodynamics is the same.\n", "  In this article, we will discuss a Lorentzian sector calculation of the\nentropy of a minimally coupled scalar field in the Schwarzschild black hole\nbackground using the brick wall model of 't Hooft. In the original article, the\nWKB approximation was used for the modes that are globally stationary. In a\nprevious article, we found that the WKB quantization rule together with a\nproper counting of the states, leads to a new expression of the scalar field\nentropy which is not proportional to the area of the horizon. The expression of\nthe entropy is logarithmically divergent in the brick wall cut-off parameter in\ncontrast to an inverse power divergence obtained earlier. In this article, we\nwill consider the entropy for a thin shell of matter field of a given thickness\nsurrounding the black hole horizon. The thickness is chosen to be large\ncompared with the Planck length and is of the order of the atomic scale. When\nexpressed in terms of a covariant cut-off parameter, the entropy of a thin\nshell of matter field of a given thickness and surrounding the horizon in the\nSchwarzschild black hole background is given by an expression proportional to\nthe area of the black hole horizon. This leading order divergent term in the\ncut-off parameter remains to be logarithmically divergent. The logarithmic\ndivergence is expected from the nature of the solution in the near-horizon\nregion. We will find that these discussions are significant in the context of\nthe continuation to the Euclidean sector and the corresponding regularization\nschemes used to evaluate the thermodynamical properties of matter fields in\ncurved spaces. These are related with the geometric aspects of curved spaces.\nThe above discussions are also important in presence of cosmological event\nhorizon.\n", "  Using the fact that every worldsheet is ruled by two (light-cone) copies of\nworldlines, the recent classification of off-shell supermultiplets of\nN-extended worldline supersymmetry is extended to construct standard off-shell\nand also unidextrous (on the half-shell) supermultiplets of worldsheet\n(p,q)-supersymmetry with no central extension. In the process, a new class of\nerror-correcting (even-split doubly-even linear block) codes is introduced and\nclassified for $p+q \\leq 8$, providing a graphical method for classification of\nsuch codes and supermultiplets. This also classifies quotients by such codes,\nof which many are not tensor products of worldline factors. Also,\nsupermultiplets that admit a complex structure are found to be depictable by\ngraphs that have a hallmark twisted reflection symmetry.\n", "  Structures seen in idealized numerical experiments on compressible\nmagnetoconvection in an imposed strong vertical magnetic field show important\ndifferences from those detected in observations or realistic numerical\nsimulations of sunspot umbrae. To elucidate the origin of these discrepancies,\nwe present a series of idealized 3D compressible magnetoconvection experiments\nthat differ from previous such experiments in several details, bringing them\ncloser to realistic solar conditions. An initially vertical magnetic field B 0\nis imposed on a time snapshot of fully developed solar-like turbulent\nconvection in a layer bounded by a stable layer from above. Upon relaxation to\na statistically steady state, the structure of the flow field and magnetic\nfield is examined. Instead of the vigorous granular convection (GRC) well known\nto take place in magnetized or weakly magnetized convection, for high values of\nB0 heat is transported by small-scale convection (SSC) in the form of narrow,\npersistent convective columns consisting of slender upflows accompanied by\nadjacent downflow patches, which are reminiscent of the 'convectons' identified\nin earlier semianalytic models. For moderate field strengths, flux separation\n(FXS) is observed: isolated field-free inclusions of GRC are embedded in a\nstrongly magnetized plasma with SSC. Between the SSC and FXS regimes, a\ntransitional regime (F/S) is identified where convectons dynamically evolve\ninto multiply segmented granular inclusions and back. Our results agree in some\naspects more closely with observed umbral structures than earlier idealized\nmodels, because they do reproduce the strong localized, patchy downflows\nimmediately adjacent to the narrow convective columns. Based on recent\nobservations of umbral dots, we suggest that in some cases the conditions in\nsunspot umbrae correspond to the newly identified F/S transitional regime.\n", "  We study the effect of electron-electron interaction on the surface\nresistivity of three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators. In the absence of\numklapp scattering, the existence of the Fermi-liquid ($T^2$) term in\nresistivity of a two-dimensional (2D) metal depends on the Fermi surface\ngeometry, in particular, on whether it is convex or concave. On doping, the\nFermi surface of 2D metallic surface states in 3D topological insulators of the\nBi$_2$Te$_3$ family changes its shape from convex to concave due to hexagonal\nwarping, while still being too small to allow for umklapp scattering. We show\nthat the $T^2$ term in the resistivity is present only in the concave regime\nand demonstrate that the resistivity obeys a universal scaling form valid for\nan arbitrary 2D Fermi surface near a convex/concave transition.\n", "  An ultracold gas of interacting fermionic atoms in a three-dimensional\noptical lattice is considered, where the lattice potential strength is\nperiodically modulated. This non-equilibrium system is non-perturbatively\ndescribed by means of a Keldysh-Floquet-Green's function approach for\nMott-Hubbard systems employing a generalized dynamical mean field theory\n(DMFT). Strong repulsive interactions between different atoms lead to a Mott\ninsulator state for the equilibrium system, but the additional external driving\nat zero temperature yields a non-equilibrium quantum critical behavior, where\nan infinite number of Floquet states arise and a transition to the liquid and\nconducting phase is given.\n", "  eLISA/NGO is a new gravitational wave detection proposal with arm length of\n10^6 km and one interferometer down-scaled from LISA. Just like LISA and\nASTROD-GW, in order to attain the requisite sensitivity for eLISA/NGO, laser\nfrequency noise must be suppressed to below the secondary noises such as the\noptical path noise, acceleration noise etc. In previous papers, we have\nperformed the numerical simulation of the time delay interferometry (TDI) for\nLISA and ASTROD-GW with one arm dysfunctional by using the CGC 2.7 ephemeris.\nThe results are well below their respective limits which the laser frequency\nnoise is required to be suppressed. In this paper, we follow the same procedure\nto simulate the time delay interferometry numerically. To do this, we work out\na set of 1000-day optimized mission orbits of the eLISA/NGO spacecraft starting\nat January 1st, 2021 using the CGC 2.7 ephemeris framework. We then use the\nnumerical method to calculate the residual optical path differences in the\nsecond-generation TDI solutions as in our previous papers. The maximum path\nlength difference, for all configurations calculated, is below 13 mm (43 ps).\nIt is well below the limit which the laser frequency noise is required to be\nsuppressed for eLISA/NGO. We compare and discuss the resulting differences due\nto the different arm lengths for various mission proposals -- eLISA/NGO, an\nNGO-LISA-type mission with a nominal arm length of 2 x 10^6 km, LISA and\nASTROD-GW.\n", "  We study a chain of identical glassy systems in a constrained equilibrium\nwhere each bond of the chain is forced to remain at a preassigned distance to\nthe previous one. We apply this description to Mean Field Glassy systems in the\nlimit of long chain where each bond is close to the previous one. We show that\nin specific conditions this pseudo-dynamic process can formally describe real\nrelaxational dynamics the long time. In particular, in mean field spin glass\nmodels we can recover in this way the equations of Langevin dynamics in the\nlong time limit at the dynamical transition temperature and below. We interpret\nthe formal identity as an evidence that in these situations the configuration\nspace is explored in a quasi-equilibrium fashion. Our general formalism, that\nrelates dynamics to equilibrium puts slow dynamics in a new perspective and\nopens the way to the computation of new dynamical quantities in glassy systems.\n", "  We extend the technique of using the Trapezoidal Rule for efficient\nevaluation of the Special Functions of Mathematical Physics given by integral\nrepresentations. This technique was recently used for Bessel functions, and\nhere we treat Incomplete Gamma functions and the general Confluent\nHypergeometric Function.\n", "  Numerous confirmations may indicate that, besides the problem of Higgs sector\nmany external parameters, the Standard Model is a complete low energy particle\ninteraction theory not crying for new physics. But there are serious problems\nwith understanding flavor in SM phenomenology. Firstly, equal number 3 of SM\nparticle generations coincide with the dimension number of outer euclidean\n3-space and secondly, the factual SM particle mass and mixing hierarchies at\nleading approximation appear solutions of the Metric equation for unit vector\ndirection angles in euclidean 3-space geometry. The power of the Metric\nequation in hierarchy phenomenology is visualized by explanation of the\noutstanding in the SM large empirical Tau-lepton, Top-quark, Bottom-quark\nmasses and small neutrino Reactor mixing angle. New in the SM weak interactions\nparticle color degree of freedom (3 quark colors and 1 lepton color) appears\nappropriate for representing quark and neutrino mixing angle unity at basic\nlevel and substantial difference at the observational level. Based on suggested\nby data idea of zero neutrino mass scale, absolute neutrino masses m1 = 0, m2 =\n0.009 eV, m3 = 0.05 eV are analyzed. They are related to the neutrino mixing\nangles and are of the same hierarchy type that the known Dirac mass patterns of\ncharged leptons and quarks.\n", "  Ambarzumyan's theorem for quadratic Sturm-Liouville problem is extended to\nsecond order differential systems of dimension d. It is shown that if the\nspectrum is the same as the spectrum belonging to the zero potential, then the\nmatrix valued functions p and q are both zero\n", "  We experimentally realized a new method for transmitting quantum information\nreliably through paired optical polarization-maintaining (PM) fibers. The\nphysical setup extends the use of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, where noises\nare canceled through interference. This method can be viewed as an improved\nversion of the current decohernce-free subspace (DFS) approach in fiber optics.\nFurthermore, the setup can be applied bidirectionally, which means that robust\nquantum communication can be achieved from both ends. To rigorously quantify\nthe amount of quantum information transferred, optical fibers are analyzed with\nthe tools developed in quantum communication theory. These results not only\nsuggests a practical means for protecting classical and quantum information\nthrough optical fibers, but also provides a new physical platform for enriching\nthe structure of the quantum communication theory.\n", "  In this paper, we propose a model in which an additional pressure due to the\neffects of the entropic force is added to the ideal fluid. Furthermore, we\nobtain the dynamic equation in the FRW universe which contains the quantum\ngravitational effects based on the description of entropic force and emergence\nof space. Our model can well explain the age of the universe and the effect of\nthe current accelerating expansion. We give the relation between the luminosity\ndistance and the redshift factor, and compare this relation with that of lambda\ncold dark matter model($\\Lambda CDM$ model).\n", "  Holographic entanglement entropy provides a direct connection between\nclassical geometry and quantum entanglement; however the usual prescription\ndoes not apply to theories of higher spin gravity, where standard notions of\ngeometry are no longer gauge invariant. We present a proposal for the\nholographic computation of entanglement entropy in field theories dual to\nhigher spin theories of gravity in AdS3. These theories have a Chern-Simons\ndescription, and our proposal involves a Wilson line in an infinite-dimensional\nrepresentation of the bulk gauge group. In the case of spin-2 gravity such\nWilson lines are the natural coupling of a heavy point particle to gravity and\nso are equivalent to the usual prescription of Ryu and Takayanagi. For higher\nspin gravity they provide a natural generalization of these ideas. We work out\nspin-3 gravity in detail, showing that our proposal recovers many expected\nresults and computes thermal entropies of black holes with higher spin charge,\nfinding agreement with previous expressions in the literature. We encounter\nsome peculiarities in the case of non-unitary RG flow backgrounds and outline\nfuture generalizations.\n", "  Tunneling conductance spectra of normal metal/insulator/superconductor\n(N/I/S) junctions are calculated to determine the potential of tunneling\nspectroscopy in investigations of topological superconductivity. Peculiar\nfeature of topological superconductors is the formation of gapless edge states\nin them. Since the conductance of N/I/S junctions is sensitive to the formation\nof these edge states, topological superconductivity can be identified through\nedge-state detection. Herein, the effects of Fermi surface anisotropy and an\napplied magnetic field on the conductance spectra are analyzed to gather\nindications that can help to identify the topological nature of actual\nmaterials.\n", "  We explore a continuum of observably and usefully inequivalent,\nfinite-dimensional off-shell representations of worldline N=4-extended\nsupersymmetry, differing from one another only in the value of a \"tuning\nparameter.\" Their dynamics turns out to be nontrivial already when restricting\nto just bilinear Lagrangians. In particular, we find a 34-parameter family of\nbilinear Lagrangians that couple two differently \"tuned\" of these\nsupermultiplets to each other and to external magnetic fields, where the\nexplicit dependence on the tuning parameters cannot be removed by any field\nredefinition and so is observable.\n", "  We study the clustering of galaxies as function of luminosity and redshift in\nthe range $0.35 < z < 1.25$ using data from the Advanced Large Homogeneous Area\nMedium Band Redshift Astronomical (ALHAMBRA) survey. The ALHAMBRA data used in\nthis work cover $2.38 \\mathrm{deg}^2$ in 7 independent fields, after applying a\ndetailed angular selection mask, with accurate photometric redshifts, $\\sigma_z\n\\lesssim 0.014 (1+z)$, down to $I_{\\rm AB} < 24$. Given the depth of the\nsurvey, we select samples in $B$-band luminosity down to $L^{\\rm th} \\simeq\n0.16 L^{*}$ at $z = 0.9$. We measure the real-space clustering using the\nprojected correlation function, accounting for photometric redshifts\nuncertainties. We infer the galaxy bias, and study its evolution with\nluminosity. We study the effect of sample variance, and confirm earlier results\nthat the COSMOS and ELAIS-N1 fields are dominated by the presence of large\nstructures. For the intermediate and bright samples, $L^{\\rm med} \\gtrsim\n0.6L^{*}$, we obtain a strong dependence of bias on luminosity, in agreement\nwith previous results at similar redshift. We are able to extend this study to\nfainter luminosities, where we obtain an almost flat relation, similar to that\nobserved at low redshift. Regarding the evolution of bias with redshift, our\nresults suggest that the different galaxy populations studied reside in haloes\ncovering a range in mass between $\\log_{10}[M_{\\rm\nh}/(h^{-1}\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot})] \\gtrsim 11.5$ for samples with $L^{\\rm med}\n\\simeq 0.3 L^{*}$ and $\\log_{10}[M_{\\rm h}/(h^{-1}\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot})] \\gtrsim\n13.0$ for samples with $L^{\\rm med} \\simeq 2 L^{*}$, with typical occupation\nnumbers in the range of $\\sim 1 - 3$ galaxies per halo.\n", "  We theoretically study the transition radiation of bulk and surface\nelectromagnetic waves by an electron crossing an interface between a layered\nsuperconductor and an isotropic dielectric. We assume that the direction of the\nelectron motion and the orientation of the superconducting layers are\nperpendicular to the interface. We derive the analytical expressions for the\nstrongly anisotropic radiation fields and for the time-integrated energy fluxes\nof bulk and oblique surface electromagnetic waves (OSWs). We show that the OSWs\nwith frequencies close to the Josephson plasma frequency $\\omega_J$ provide the\nmain contribution to the OSWs energy flux. Moreover, for frequencies close to\nthe Josephson plasma frequency, the spectral density of the OSWs radiation\ndiverges at some critical value of the azimuth angle $\\varphi$. At the angles\n$\\varphi=0$ and $\\varphi=90^o$, the radiation field has a transverse magnetic\npolarization. We have also studied the Cherenkov radiation by the electron\nescaping from the layered superconductor and show that this radiation is almost\nmonochromatic. A remarkable feature of the Cherenkov radiation in a layered\nsuperconductor is that, contrary to the isotropic case, the Cherenkov radiation\ndistinctly manifests itself in the angular dependence of the radiation energy\nflux.\n", "  In this paper we consider an application of the recently proposed quantum\nhashing technique for computing Boolean functions in the quantum communication\nmodel. The combination of binary functions on non-binary quantum hash function\nis done via polynomial presentation, which we have called a characteristic of a\nBoolean function. Based on the characteristic polynomial presentation of\nBoolean functions and quantum hashing technique we present a method for\ncomputing Boolean functions in the quantum one-way communication model, where\none of the parties performs his computations and sends a message to the other\nparty, who must output the result after his part of computations. Some of the\nresults are also true in a more restricted Simultaneous Message Passing model\nwith no shared resources, in which communicating parties can interact only via\nthe referee. We give several examples of Boolean functions whose polynomial\npresentations have specific properties allowing for construction of quantum\ncommunication protocols that are provably exponentially better than classical\nones in the simultaneous message passing setting.\n", "  We studied the radiative muon decay $\\mu^+ \\to e^+\\nu\\bar{\\nu}\\gamma$ by\nusing for the first time an almost fully polarized muon source. We identified a\nlarge sample (~13000) of these decays in a total sample of 1.8x10^14 positive\nmuon decays collected in the MEG experiment in the years 2009--2010 and\nmeasured the branching ratio B($\\mu^+ \\to e^+\\nu\\bar{\\nu}\\gamma$) =\n(6.03+-0.14(stat.)+-0.53(sys.))x10^-8 for E_e > 45 MeV and E_{\\gamma} > 40 MeV,\nconsistent with the Standard Model prediction. The precise measurement of this\ndecay mode provides a basic tool for the timing calibration, a normalization\nchannel, and a strong quality check of the complete MEG experiment in the\nsearch for $\\mu^+ \\to e^+\\gamma$ process.\n", "  Plasmonics and metamaterials have attracted considerable attention over the\npast decade, owing to the revolutionary impacts that they bring to both the\nfundamental physics and practical applications in multiple disciplines.\nAlthough the two fields initially advanced along their individual trajectories\nin parallel, they started to interfere with each other when metamaterials\nreached the optical regime. The dynamic interplay between plasmonics and\nmetamaterials has generated a number of innovative concepts and approaches,\nwhich are impossible with either area alone. This review presents the\nfundamentals, recent advances and future perspectives in the emerging field of\nplasmonic metamaterials, aiming to open up new exciting opportunities for\nnanoscience and nanotechnology.\n", "  It is assumed that the two-component spinor formalisms for curved spacetimes\nthat are endowed with torsionful affine connexions can supply a local\ndescription of dark energy in terms of classical massive spin-one uncharged\nfields. The relevant wave functions are related to torsional affine potentials\nwhich bear invariance under the action of the generalized Weyl gauge group.\nSuch potentials are thus taken to carry an observable character and emerge from\ncontracted spin affinities whose patterns are chosen in a suitable way. New\ncovariant calculational techniques are then developed towards deriving\nexplicitly the wave equations that supposedly control the propagation in\nspacetime of the dark energy background. What immediately comes out of this\nderivation is a presumably natural display of interactions between the fields\nand both spin torsion and curvatures. The physical properties that may arise\ndirectly from the solutions to the wave equations are not brought out.\n", "  In the context of a canonical quantization of general relativity, one can\ndeform the loop gravity phase space on a graph by replacing the T*SU(2) phase\nspace attached to each edge by SL(2,C) seen as a phase space. This deformation\nis supposed to encode the presence of a non-zero cosmological constant. Here we\nshow how to parametrize this phase space in terms of spinor variables, thus\nobtaining deformed spinor networks for loop gravity, with a deformed action of\nthe gauge group SU(2) at the vertices. These are to be formally interpreted as\nthe generalization of loop gravity twisted geometries to a hyperbolic\ncurvature.\n", "  Starting from the observation that one of the most successful methods for\nsolving the Kohn-Sham equations for periodic systems -- the plane-wave method\n-- is a spectral method based on eigenfunction expansion, we formulate a\nspectral method designed towards solving the Kohn-Sham equations for clusters.\nThis allows for efficient calculation of the electronic structure of clusters\n(and molecules) with high accuracy and systematic convergence properties\nwithout the need for any artificial periodicity. The basis functions in this\nmethod form a complete orthonormal set and are expressible in terms of\nspherical harmonics and spherical Bessel functions. Computation of the occupied\neigenstates of the discretized Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian is carried out using a\ncombination of preconditioned block eigensolvers and Chebyshev polynomial\nfilter accelerated subspace iterations. Several algorithmic and computational\naspects of the method, including computation of the electrostatics terms and\nparallelization are discussed. We have implemented these methods and algorithms\ninto an efficient and reliable package called ClusterES (Cluster Electronic\nStructure). A variety of benchmark calculations employing local and non-local\npseudopotentials are carried out using our package and the results are compared\nto the literature. Convergence properties of the basis set are discussed\nthrough numerical examples. Computations involving large systems that contain\nthousands of electrons are demonstrated to highlight the efficacy of our\nmethodology. The use of our method to study clusters with arbitrary point group\nsymmetries is briefly discussed.\n", "  We find an optical Raman lattice without spin-orbit coupling showing chiral\ntopological orders for cold atoms. Two incident plane-wave lasers are applied\nto generate simultaneously a double-well square lattice and periodic Raman\ncouplings, the latter of which drive the nearest-neighbor hopping and create a\nstaggered flux pattern across the lattice. Such a minimal setup is can yield\nthe quantum anomalous Hall effect in the single particle regime, while in the\ninteracting regime it achieves the $J_1$-$J_2$-$K$ model with all parameters\ncontrollable, which supports a chiral spin liquid phase. We further show that\nheating in the present optical Raman lattice is reduced by more than one order\nof magnitude compared with the conventional laser-assisted tunneling schemes.\nThis suggests that the predicted topological states be well reachable with the\ncurrent experimental capability.\n", "  The ability to trap matter is of great importance in experimental physics\nsince it allows isolation and measurement of intrinsic properties of the\ntrapped matter. We present a study of a three dimensional (3D) trap for a\ndiamagnetic rod in a pair of diametric cylindrical magnets. This system yields\na fascinating 1D camelback potential along the longitudinal axis which is one\nof the elementary model potentials of interest in physics. This potential can\nbe tailored by controlling the magnet length/radius aspect ratio. We developed\ntheoretical models and verify them with experiments using graphite rods. We\nshow that, in general, a camelback field or potential profile exists in between\na pair of parallel linear dipole distribution. By exploiting this potential, we\ndemonstrate a unique and simple technique to determine the magnetic\nsusceptibility of the rod. This system could be further utilized as a platform\nfor custom-designed 1D potential, a highly sensitive force-distance transducer\nor a trap for semiconductor nanowires.\n", "  We elucidate consistency of the so-called corner equations which are\nelementary building blocks of Euler-Lagrange equations for two-dimensional\npluri-Lagrangian problems. We show that their consistency can be derived from\nthe existence of two independent octahedron relations. We give explicit\nformulas for octahedron relations in terms of corner equations.\n", "  Introducing the well known Papapetrou field as the gravitoelectromagnetic\nfield tensor, we express the Maxwell-type part of the 3-dimensional\nquasi-Maxwell form of the {\\it vacuum} Einstein field equations in terms of\ndifferential forms, analogous to their electromagnetic counterparts in curved\nspacetimes. Using the same formalism we introduce the junction conditions on\nnon-null hypersurfaces in terms of the introduced gravitoelectromagnetic\n4-vector fields and apply them to the case of the Van Stockum interior and\nexterior solutions.\n", "  Low open circuit voltage ($V_{OC}$) has been recognized as the number one\nproblem in the current generation of Cu$_{2}$ZnSn(Se,S)$_{4}$ (CZTSSe) solar\ncells. We report high light intensity and low temperature Suns-$V_{OC}$\nmeasurement in high performance CZTSSe devices. The Suns-$V_{OC}$ curves\nexhibit bending at high light intensity, which points to several prospective\n$V_{OC}$ limiting mechanisms that could impact the $V_{OC}$, even at 1 sun for\nlower performing samples. These V$_{OC}$ limiting mechanisms include low bulk\nconductivity (because of low hole density or low mobility), bulk or interface\ndefects including tail states, and a non-ohmic back contact for low carrier\ndensity CZTSSe. The non-ohmic back contact problem can be detected by\nSuns-$V_{OC}$ measurements with different monochromatic illumination. These\nlimiting factors may also contribute to an artificially lower $J_{SC}$-$V_{OC}$\ndiode ideality factor.\n", "  We show that a specific superposition principle is valid for \\emph{nonlinear}\nJosephson plasma waves in layered superconductors. We study theoretically the\nreflection and transmission of terahertz waves through a finite-size\nsuperconducting slab placed inside a rectangular waveguide with ideal-metal\nwalls. We assume that the superconducting layers are parallel to the waveguide\naxis. We show that there exist two specific mutually-orthogonal polarizations\nfor waves which, in spite of the nonlinearity, reflect and transmit through the\nsuperconductor \\emph{independently}. The wave of the first polarization causes\na strong shielding current along the crystallographic \\textbf{ab}-plane of the\nsuperconductor. Therefore, this wave reflects nearly completely from the\nsuperconductor and excites only an evanescent mode inside it. The wave of the\nother polarization does not contain the electric field component parallel to\nboth the sample surface and the crystallographic \\textbf{ab}-plane, and excites\nmuch weaker shielding currents. Therefore, it partially reflects and partially\ntransmits through the sample. Moreover, this wave excites the nonlinear mode in\nthe layered superconductor, and the transmission coefficient of the\nsuperconductor depends on the amplitude of the incident wave of this\npolarization.On the basis of the discussed superposition principle, we suggest\na new method for solving nonlinear problems of waves interaction in layered\nsuperconductors. Namely, it is reasonably to represent incident, reflected, and\ntransmitted waves of any polarizations as superpositions of the modes with the\ntwo specific polarizations considered here, and then solve the problem\nseparately for these modes. We apply this method to the case of nonlinear\ninteraction and mutual transformation of the transverse electric and transverse\nmagnetic modes in layered superconductors.\n", "  The spontaneous violation of Lorentz and diffeomorphism invariance in a phase\nnear the big bang lowers the entropy, allowing for an arrow of time and the\nsecond law of thermodynamics. The spontaneous symmetry breaking leads to\n$O(3,1)\\rightarrow O(3)\\times R$, where $O(3)$ is the rotational symmetry of\nthe Friedmann-Lema\\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker spacetime. The Weyl curvature\ntensor $C_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}$ vanishes in the FLRW spacetime satisfying the\nPenrose zero Weyl curvature conjecture. The requirement of a measure of\ngravitational entropy is discussed. The vacuum expectation value $\\langle\n0\\vert\\psi_\\mu\\vert 0\\rangle\\neq 0$ for a vector field $\\psi_\\mu$ acts as an\norder parameter and at the critical temperature $T_c$ a phase transition occurs\nbreaking the Lorentz symmetry spontaneously. During the ordered $O(3)$ symmetry\nphase the entropy is vanishingly small and for $T < T_c$ as the universe\nexpands the anti-restored $O(3,1)$ Lorentz symmetry leads to a disordered phase\nand a large increase in entropy creating the arrow of time.\n", "  Via the worldline instanton method, we study electron-positron pair creation\nby a strong electric field of the profile $E/\\cosh^2(kx)$ superimposed by a\nweaker pulse $E'/\\cosh^2(\\omega t)$. If the temporal Keldysh parameter\n$\\gamma_\\omega=m\\omega/(qE)$ exceeds a threshold value $\\gamma_\\omega^{\\rm\ncrit}$ which depends on the spatial Keldysh parameter $\\gamma_k=mk/(qE)$, we\nfind a drastic enhancement of the pair creation probability -- reporting on\nwhat we believe to be the first analytic non-perturbative result for the\ninterplay between temporal and spatial field dependences $E(t,x)$ in the\nSauter-Schwinger effect.\n", "  A simple stochastic model of a self regulating gene that displays bistable\nswitching is analyzed. While on, a gene transcribes mRNA at a constant rate.\nTranscription factors can bind to the DNA and affect the gene's transcription\nrate. Before an mRNA is degraded, it synthesizes protein, which in turn\nregulates gene activity by influencing the activity of transcription factors.\nProtein is slowly removed from the system through degradation. Depending on how\nthe protein regulates gene activity, the protein concentration can exhibit\nnoise induced bistable switching. An asymptotic approximation of the mean\nswitching rate is derived that includes the pre exponential factor, which\nimproves upon a previously reported logarithmically accurate approximation.\nWith the improved accuracy, a uniformly accurate approximation of the\nstationary probability density, describing the gene, mRNA copy number, and\nprotein concentration is also obtained.\n", "  We discuss the behavior of large ensembles of phase oscillators networking\nvia scale-free topologies in the presence of a positive correlation between the\noscillators' natural frequencies and network's degrees. In particular, we show\nthat the further presence of degree-degree correlation in the network structure\nhas important consequences on the nature of the phase transition characterizing\nthe passage from the phase-incoherent to the phase-coherent network's state.\nWhile high levels of positive and negative mixing consistently induce a\nsecond-order phase transition, moderate values of assortative mixing, such as\nthose ubiquitously characterizing social networks in the real world, greatly\nenhance the irreversible nature of explosive synchronization in growing\nscale-free networks. This latter effect corresponds to a maximization of the\narea and of the width of the hysteretic loop that differentiates the forward\nand backward transitions to synchronization.\n", "  The no-core configuration-interaction model based on the isospin- and\nangular-momentum projected density functional formalism is introduced. Two\napplications of the model are presented: (i) determination of spectra of 0+\nstates in 62Zn and (ii) determination of isospin-symmetry-breaking corrections\nto superallowed beta-decay between isobaric-analogue 0+ states in 38Ca and 38K.\nIt is shown that, without readjusting a single parameter of the underlying\nSkyrme interaction, in all three nuclei, the model reproduces the 0+ spectra\nsurprisingly well.\n", "  Conformally recurrent pseudo-Riemannian manifolds of dimension n>4 are\ninvestigated. The Weyl tensor is represented as a Kulkarni-Nomizu product. If\nthe square of the Weyl tensor is nonzero, a covariantly constant symmetric\ntensor is constructed, that is quadratic in the Weyl tensor. Then, by Grycak's\ntheorem, the explicit expression of the traceless part of the Ricci tensor is\nobtained, up to a scalar function. The Ricci tensor has at most two distinct\neigenvalues, and the recurrence vector is an eigenvector. Lorentzian\nconformally recurrent manifolds are then considered. If the square of the Weyl\ntensor is nonzero, the manifold is decomposable. A null recurrence vector makes\nthe Weyl tensor of algebraic type IId or higher in the Bel - Debever - Ortaggio\nclassification, while a time-like recurrence vector makes the Weyl tensor\npurely electric.\n", "  Recent experimental efforts towards the detection of Majorana bound states\nhave focused on creating the conditions for topological superconductivity. Here\nwe demonstrate an alternative route, which achieves fully localised zero-energy\nMajorana bound states when a topologically trivial superconductor is strongly\ncoupled to a helical normal region. Such a junction can be experimentally\nrealised by e.g. proximitizing a finite section of a nanowire with spin-orbit\ncoupling, and combining electrostatic depletion and a Zeeman field to drive the\nnon-proximitized (normal) portion into a helical phase. Majorana zero modes\nemerge in such an open system without fine-tuning as a result of\ncharge-conjugation symmetry, and can be ultimately linked to the existence of\n`exceptional points' (EPs) in parameter space, where two quasibound Andreev\nlevels bifurcate into two quasibound Majorana zero modes. After the EP, one of\nthe latter becomes non-decaying as the junction approaches perfect Andreev\nreflection, thus resulting in a Majorana dark state (MDS) localised at the NS\njunction. We show that MDSs exhibit the full range of properties associated to\nconventional closed-system Majorana bound states (zero-energy,\nself-conjugation, $4\\pi$-Josephson effect and non-Abelian braiding statistics),\nwhile not requiring topological superconductivity.\n", "  A thin-shell wormhole is theoretically constructible by surgically grafting\ntogether two Schwarzschild spacetimes using the so-called cut-and-paste\ntechnique. By describing such a wormhole as the limiting case of a spherical\nshell, it is shown that the structure must be unstable to linearized radial\nperturbations. Some earlier studies by the author et al. have shown, however,\nthat under certain conditions, thin-shell wormholes can be stable.\n", "  The assumption of source independence was used to reveal nonlocal (apart from\nstandard Bell-CHSH scenario) nature of correlations generated in entanglement\nswapping experiments. In this work, we have derived a set of sufficient\ncriteria, imposed on the states (produced by the sources) under which source\nindependence can reveal nonbilocal nature of correlations in a quantum network.\nTo show this, we have considered real two qubit X states thereby discussing the\nvarious utilities of assuming source independence in a quantum network.\n", "  Nowadays the Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov dimension have become so\nwidespread and common that they are often used without references to the\nrigorous definitions or pioneering works. It may lead to a confusion since\nthere are at least two well-known definitions, which are used in computations:\nthe upper bounds of the exponential growth rate of the norms of linearized\nsystem solutions (Lyapunov characteristic exponents, LCEs) and the upper bounds\nof the exponential growth rate of the singular values of the fundamental matrix\nof linearized system (Lyapunov exponents, LEs). In this work the relation\nbetween Lyapunov exponents and Lyapunov characteristic exponents is discussed.\nThe invariance of Lyapunov exponents for regular and irregular linearizations\nunder the change of coordinates is demonstrated.\n", "  The concept of negative temperature has recently received renewed interest in\nthe context of debates about the correct definition of the thermodynamic\nentropy in statistical mechanics. Several researchers have identified the\nthermodynamic entropy exclusively with the \"volume entropy'' suggested by\nGibbs, and have further concluded that by this definition, negative\ntemperatures violate the principles of thermodynamics. We disagree with these\nconclusions. We demonstrate that volume entropy is inconsistent with the\npostulates of thermodynamics for systems with non-monotonic energy densities,\nwhile a definition of entropy based on the probability distributions of\nmacroscopic variables does satisfy the postulates of thermodynamics. Our\nresults confirm that negative temperature is a valid extension of\nthermodynamics.\n", "  We introduce a new class of $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric complex crystals which\nare almost transparent and one-way reflectionless over a broad frequency range\naround the Bragg frequency, i.e. unidirectionally invisible, regardless of the\nthickness $L$ of the crystal. The $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric complex crystal is\nsynthesized by a supersymmetric transformation of an Hermitian square well\npotential, and exact analytical expressions of transmission and reflection\ncoefficients are given. As $L$ is increased, the transmittance and reflectance\nfrom one side remain close to one and zero, respectively, whereas the\nreflectance from the other side secularly grows like $ \\sim L^2$ owing to\nunidirectional Bragg scattering. This is a distinctive feature as compared to\nthe previously studied case of the complex sinusoidal $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric\npotential $V(x)=V_0 \\exp(-2i k_ox)$ at the symmetry breaking point, where\ntransparency breaks down as $L \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n", "  In this work, we study the Gross-Pitaevskii hierarchy on general --rational\nand irrational-- rectangular tori of dimension two and three. This is a system\nof infinitely many linear partial differential equations which arises in the\nrigorous derivation of the nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation. We prove a\nconditional uniqueness result for the hierarchy. In two dimensions, this result\nallows us to obtain a rigorous derivation of the defocusing cubic nonlinear\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation from the dynamics of many-body quantum systems. On\nirrational tori, this question was posed as an open problem in previous work of\nKirkpatrick, Schlein, and Staffilani.\n", "  By comparing Deligne complex and Aeppli-Bott-Chern complex, we construct a\ndifferential cohomology $\\widehat{H}^*(X, *, *)$ that plays the role of\nHarvey-Lawson spark group $\\widehat{H}^*(X, *)$, and a cohomology $H^*_{ABC}(X;\n\\Z(*, *))$ that plays the role of Deligne cohomology $H^*_{\\mathcal{D}}(X;\n\\Z(*))$ for every complex manifold $X$. They fit in the short exact sequence $$\n0\\rightarrow H^{k+1}_{ABC}(X; \\Z(p, q)) \\rightarrow \\widehat{H}^k(X, p, q)\n\\overset{\\delta_1}{\\rightarrow} Z^{k+1}_I(X, p, q) \\rightarrow 0$$ and\n$\\widehat{H}^{\\bullet}(X, \\bullet, \\bullet)$ possess ring structure and refined\nChern classes, acted by the complex conjugation, and if some primitive\ncohomology groups of $X$ vanish, there is a Lefschetz isomorphism. Furthermore,\nthe ring structure of $H^{\\bullet}_{ABC}(X; \\Z(\\bullet, \\bullet))$ inherited\nfrom $\\widehat{H}^{\\bullet}(X, \\bullet, \\bullet)$ is compatible with the one of\nthe analytic Deligne cohomology $H^{\\bullet}(X; \\Z(\\bullet))$. We compute\n$\\widehat{H}^*(X, *, *)$ for $X$ the Iwasawa manifold and its small\ndeformations and get a refinement of the classification given by Nakamura.\n", "  Starting from fundamental multiple scattering theory it is shown that\nnegative refraction indices are feasible for matter waves passing a\nwell-defined ensemble of scatterers. A simple approach to this topic is\npresented and explicit examples for systems of scatterers in 1D and 3D are\nstated that imply negative refraction for a generic incoming quantum wave\npacket. Essential features of the effective scattering field, densities and\nfrequency spectrum of scatterers are considered. Additionally it is shown that\nnegative refraction indices allow perfect transmission of the wave passing the\nensemble of scatterers. Finally the concept of the superlens is discussed,\nsince it is based on negative refraction and can be extended to matter waves\nutilizing the observations presented in this paper. This paves the way for\n'untouchable' quantum systems in analogy to cloaking devices for\nelectromagnetic waves.\n", "  In a paper of 1978, Eugene Parker postulated the need for hydraulic downward\nmotion to explain magnetic flux concentrations at the solar surface. A similar\nprocess has recently also been seen in simplified (e.g., isothermal) models of\nflux concentrations from the negative effective magnetic pressure instability.\nWe study the effects of partial ionization near the radiative surface on the\nformation of such magnetic flux concentrations. We first obtain one-dimensional\n(1D) equilibrium solutions using either a Kramers-like opacity or the ${\\rm\nH}^{-}$ opacity. The resulting atmospheres are then used as initial conditions\nin two-dimensional (2D) models where flows are driven by an imposed gradient\nforce resembling a localized negative pressure in the form of a blob. To\nisolate the effects of partial ionization and radiation, we ignore turbulence\nand convection. In 1D models, due to partial ionization, an unstable\nstratification forms always near the surface. We show that the extrema in the\nspecific entropy profiles correspond to the extrema in degree of ionization. In\nthe 2D models without partial ionization, flux concentrations form close to the\nheight where the blob is placed. In models with partial ionization, such flux\nconcentrations form at the surface much above the blob. This is due to the\ncorresponding unstable layer in specific entropy. With ${\\rm H}^{-}$ opacity,\nflux concentrations are weaker due to the stably stratified deeper parts. We\ndemonstrate that, together with density stratification, the imposed source of\nnegative pressure drives the formation of flux concentrations. We find that the\ninclusion of partial ionization affects entropy profiles causing the strong\nflux concentrations to form closer to the surface. We speculate that turbulence\nis needed to limit the strength of flux concentrations and homogenize the\nspecific entropy to a more nearly marginal stratification.\n", "  Supersymmetric (SUSY) optical structures provide a versatile platform to\nmanipulate the scattering and localization properties of light, with potential\napplications to mode conversion, spatial multiplexing and invisible devices.\nHere we show that SUSY can be exploited to realize broadband transparent\nintersections between guiding structures in optical networks for both\ncontinuous and discretized light. These include transparent crossing of\nhigh-contrast-index waveguides and directional couplers, as well as crossing of\nguiding channels in coupled resonator lattices.\n", "  Photonic systems based on energy-time entanglement have been proposed to test\nlocal realism using the Bell inequality. A violation of this inequality\nnormally also certifies security of device-independent quantum key\ndistribution, so that an attacker cannot eavesdrop or control the system. Here,\nwe show how this security test can be circumvented in energy-time entangled\nsystems when using standard avalanche photodetectors, allowing an attacker to\ncompromise the system without leaving a trace. With tailored pulses of\nclassical light we reach Bell values up to 3.63 at 97.6% detector efficiency\nwhich is an extreme violation. This is the first demonstration of a\nviolation-faking source that both gives tunable violation and high detector\nefficiency. The implications are severe: the standard\nClauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality cannot be used to show device-independent\nsecurity for standard postselecting energy-time entanglement setups. We\nconclude with suggestions of improved tests and experimental setups that can\nre-establish device-independent security.\n", "  We briefly describe how the Monte Carlo generator WHIZARD 2.2 can be employed\nto study large QCD effects enhancing the top-antitop production threshold at a\nnext-generation lepton collider. While present state-of-the-art predictions at\nNNLL order are confined to inclusive total cross sections, our tool can be used\nto simulate differential distributions including NLL threshold resummation in\nthe production, and with off-shell decaying tops. The new model will be shipped\nwith WHIZARD from version 2.2.3 onwards, to be released along with this\narticle.\n", "  We introduce a general contagion-like model for competing opinions that\nincludes dynamic resistance to alternative opinions. We show that this model\ncan describe candidate vote distributions, spatial vote correlations, and a\nslow approach to opinion consensus with sensible parameter values. These\nempirical properties of large group dynamics, previously understood using\ndistinct models, may be different aspects of human behavior that can be\ncaptured by a more unified model, such as the one introduced in this paper.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of unidirectional semi-infinite chains of type-I\noscillators that are periodically forced at their root node, as an archetype of\nwave generation in neural networks. In previous studies, numerical simulations\nbased on uniform forcing have revealed that trajectories approach a traveling\nwave in the far-downstream, large time limit. While this phenomenon seems\ntypical, it is hardly anticipated because the system does not exhibit any of\nthe crucial properties employed in available proofs of existence of traveling\nwaves in lattice dynamical systems. Here, we give a full mathematical proof of\ngeneration under uniform forcing in a simple piecewise affine setting for which\nthe dynamics can be solved explicitly. In particular, our analysis proves\nexistence, global stability, and robustness with respect to perturbations of\nthe forcing, of families of waves with arbitrary period/wave number in some\nrange, for every value of the parameters in the system.\n", "  We study the implications of the Higgs discovery and of recent results from\ndark matter searches on real singlet scalar dark matter. The phenomenology of\nthe model is defined by only two parameters, the singlet scalar mass $m_S$ and\nthe quartic coupling $a_2$ between the SU(2) Higgs and the singlet scalar. We\nconcentrate on the window $5 < m_S/{\\rm GeV} < 300$. The most dramatic impact\non the viable parameter space of the model comes from direct dark matter\nsearches with LUX, and, for very low masses in the few GeV range, from\nconstraints from the invisible decay width of the Higgs. In the resonant region\nthe best constraints come from gamma-ray line searches. We show that they leave\nonly a small region of viable parameter space, for dark matter masses within a\nfew percent of half the mass of the Higgs. We demonstrate that direct and\nindirect dark matter searches (especially the search for monochromatic\ngamma-ray lines) will play a key role in closing the residual parameter space\nin the near future.\n", "  We study the root of unity degeneration of cluster algebras and quantum\ndilogarithm identities. We prove identities for the cyclic dilogarithm\nassociated with a mutation sequence of a quiver, and as a consequence new\nidentities for the non-compact quantum dilogarithm at $b=1$.\n", "  Clock synchronization between the ground and satellites is a fundamental\nissue in future quantum telecommunication, navigation, and global positioning\nsystems. Here, we propose a scheme of near-Earth orbit satellite-based quantum\nclock synchronization with atmospheric dispersion cancellation by taking into\naccount the spacetime background of the Earth. Two frequency entangled pulses\nare employed to synchronize two clocks, one at a ground station and the other\nat a satellite. The time discrepancy of the two clocks is introduced into the\npulses by moving mirrors and is extracted by measuring the coincidence rate of\nthe pulses in the interferometer. We find that the pulses are distorted due to\neffects of gravity when they propagate between the Earth and the satellite,\nresulting in remarkably affected coincidence rates. We also find that the\nprecision of the clock synchronization is sensitive to the source parameters\nand the altitude of the satellite. The scheme provides a solution for\nsatellite-based quantum clock synchronization with high precision, which can be\nrealized, in principle, with current technology.\n", "  In quantum mechanics, the space-fractional Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation provides\na natural extension of the standard Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation when the Brownian\ntrajectories in Feynman path integrals are replaced by Levy flights. Here an\noptical realization of the fractional Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, based on\ntransverse light dynamics in aspherical optical cavities, is proposed. As an\nexample a laser implementation of the fractional quantum harmonic oscillator is\npresented, in which dual Airy beams can be selectively generated under off-axis\nlongitudinal pumping.\n", "  The supersymmetric (SUSY) structure of coupled-mode equations that describe\nscattering of optical waves in one-dimensional Bragg gratings is highlighted.\nThis property can find applications to the synthesis of special Bragg filters\nand distributed-feedback (DFB) optical cavities. In particular, multiple SUSY\n(Darboux-Crum) transformations can be used to synthesize DFB filters with any\ndesired number of resonances at target frequencies. As an example, we describe\nthe design of a DFB structure with a set of equally-spaced resonances, i.e. a\nfrequency comb transmission filter.\n", "  The two-photon momentum distribution of annihilating electron-positron pairs\nin ferromagnetic nickel (Ni) was determined by measuring the spin-polarized\ntwo-dimensional angular correlation of annihilation radiation (ACAR). The\nspectra were compared with theoretical results obtained within LDA+DMFT, a\ncombination of the local density approximation (LDA) and the many-body\ndynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The self-energy describing the electronic\ncorrelations in Ni is found to make important anisotropic contributions to the\nmomentum distribution which are not present in LDA. Based on a detailed\ncomparison of the theoretical and experimental results the strength of the\nlocal electronic interaction U in ferromagnetic Ni is determined as 2.0 +- 0.1\neV.\n", "  We study a well known machine learning model -the perceptron- as a simple\nmodel of jamming of hard objects. We exhibit two regimes: 1) a convex\noptimisation regime where jamming is hypostatic and non-critical. 2) a non\nconvex optimisation regime where jamming is isostatic and critical. We\ncharacterise the critical jamming phase through exponents describing the\ndistributions law of forces and gaps. Surprisingly we find that these exponents\ncoincide with the corresponding ones recently computed in high dimensional hard\nspheres. In addition, modifying the perceptron to a random linear programming\nproblem, we show that isostaticity is not a sufficient condition for singular\nforce and gap distributions. For that, fragmentation of the space of solutions\n(replica symmetry breaking) appears to be a crucial ingredient. We hypothesise\nuniversality for a large class of non-convex constrained satisfaction problems\nwith continuous variables.\n", "  The epitaxial atomistic interfaces of two insulating oxides, LaAlO$_3$\n(LAO)/SrTiO$_3$ (STO), have attracted great interest owing to rich emergent\nphenomena \\cite{hwang12:nmat,coey13:mrs,ohtomo04:} such as interface\nmetallicity \\cite{ohtomo04:,nakagawa06:}, thickness dependent insulator-metal\ntransition \\cite{huijben06:nmat}, superconductivity \\cite{N.Reyren08312007},\nferromagnetism \\cite{brinkman.07:natmat}, and even their coexistence\n\\cite{bert11:nphys,li11:nphys,dikin11:prl}. However, the physics origin of\nferromagnetic ordering in the $n$-type LAO/STO interface is in debate. Here we\npropose that the polar distortion of La atom can ignite the ferromagnetism at\nthe interface even without oxygen vacancy. The induced hybridization between La\n$d_{z^2}$ and O $p_{x,y}$ states can mediate double-exchange like interaction\nbetween Ti $d_{xy}$ electrons. We further suggest that the structural and\nelectrical modification of the outermost surface of LAO or switching the\npolarization direction of ferroelectric overlayers on LAO/STO can promote such\nLa displacement.\n", "  The recently discovered layered BiS2-based superconductors have attracted a\ngreat deal of interest due to their structural similarity to cuprate and\niron-pnictide superconductors. We have performed Raman scattering measurements\non two superconducting crystals NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Tc = 4.5 K) and NdO0.7F0.3BiS2\n(Tc = 4.8 K). The observed Raman phonon modes are assigned with the aid of\nfirst-principles calculations. The asymmetrical phonon mode around 118 cm-1\nreveals a small electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling constant 0.16, which is\ninsufficient to generate superconductivity at ~ 4.5 K. In the Raman spectra\nthere exists a clear temperature-dependent hump around 100 cm-1, which can be\nwell understood in term of inter-band vertical transitions around Fermi\nsurface. The transitions get boosted when the particular rectangular-like Fermi\nsurface meets band splitting caused by spin-orbit coupling. It enables a unique\nand quantitative insight into the band splitting.\n", "  Lately, so-called \"quantum\" models, based on parts of the mathematics of\nquantum mechanics, have been developed in decision theory and cognitive\nsciences to account for seemingly irrational or paradoxical human judgments. We\nconsider here some such quantum-like models that address question order\neffects, i.e. cases in which given answers depend on the order of presentation\nof the questions. Models of various dimensionalities could be used, can the\nsimplest ones be empirically adequate? From the quantum law of reciprocity, we\nderive new empirical predictions that we call the Grand Reciprocity equations,\nthat must be satisfied by several existing quantum-like models, in their\nnon-degenerate versions. Using substantial existing data sets, we show that\nthese non-degenerate versions fail the GR test in most cases, which means that,\nif quantum-like models of the kind considered here are to work, it can only be\nin their degenerate versions. However, we suggest that the route of degenerate\nmodels is not necessarily an easy one, and we argue for more research on the\nempirical adequacy of degenerate quantum-like models in general.\n", "  Instead of the scalar \"dilaton\" field that is usually adopted to construct\nconformally invariant Lagrangians for gravitation, we here propose a hybrid\nconstruction, involving both a complex dilaton scalar and a Weyl gauge-vector,\nin accord with Weyl's original concept of a non-Riemannian conformal geometry\nwith a transport law for length and time intervals, for which this gauge vector\nis required. Such a hybrid construction permits us to avoid the wrong sign of\nthe dilaton kinetic term (the ghost problem) that afflicts the usual\nconstruction. The introduction of a Weyl gauge-vector and its interaction with\nthe dilaton also has the collateral benefit of providing an explicit mechanism\nfor spontaneous breaking of the conformal symmetry, whereby the dilaton and the\nWeyl gauge-vector acquire masses somewhat smaller than m/sub/P by the\nColeman-Weinberg mechanism. Conformal symmetry breaking is assumed to precede\ninflation, which occurs later by a separate GUT or electroweak symmetry\nbreaking, as in inflationary models based on the Higgs boson.\n", "  A method for realizing asymmetric (one-way) transmission of discretized light\nin modulated, linear and purely passive optical lattices is suggested, which\nexploits the idea of unidirectional coherent perfect absorption. The system\nconsists of a linear photonic lattice of coupled resonators or waveguides, side\ncoupled to a chain of lossy elements, in which light can avoid the occupation\nof the dissipative sites when propagating in one way, but not in the opposite\none. Non-reciprocity requires modulation of the resonator/waveguide parameters,\nrealizing a dissipative optical Aharonov-Bohm diode with non-reciprocal\nbehavior.\n", "  In-situ hydrostatic and uniaxial high pressure studies were performed on\nrecently discovered CrAs-based qausi-one-dimensional superconductors A2Cr3As3\n(A=K and Rb). The established Pressure-Temperature phase diagram in this study\nclearly demonstrates that either hydrostatic pressure or uniaxial pressure\nglobally suppresses the superconducting transition temperature (Tc), and the\nlatter is more effective than the former. Interestingly, in the same\nhydrostatic pressure environment, the suppressing rate of Tc in Rb2Cr3As3 is\nnearly twice as that of K2Cr3As3. Significantly, the reduced Tc in these\nsuperconductors can fully recover to its ambient-pressure value after the\napplied pressure is entirely released. Our results suggest that the bonding\ndistance and angle between Cr-Cr in the Cr3As3 chains are the key factor in\ndetermining Tc and that the optimal lattice for superconductivity is hosted in\nthe pristine K2Cr3As3.\n", "  The Friedmann equation in the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker(FRW) universe with\nany spatial curvature is derived from the first law of thermodynamics on the\nevent horizon. The key idea is to redefine a Hawking temperature on the event\nhorizon. Furthermore, we obtain the evolution equations of the universe\nincluding the quantum correction and explore the evolution of the universe in\nthe $f(R)$ gravity. In addition, we also investigate the generalized second law\nof thermodynamics in Einstein gravity and the $f(R)$ gravity. This perspective\nalso implies that the first law of thermodynamics on the event horizon have a\ngeneral description in respect of the evolution of the FRW universe.\n", "  The recent renaissance of black phosphorus (BP) as a two-dimensional 2D\nlayered material has generated tremendous interest in its tunable electronic\nband gap and highly anisotropic transport properties that offer new\nopportunities for device applications. Many of these outstanding properties are\nattributed to its unique structural characters that still need elucidation.\nHere we show Raman measurements that reveal an ultralow-frequency collective\ncompression mode (CCM), which is unprecedented among similar 2D layered\nmaterials. This novel CCM indicates an unusually strong interlayer coupling in\nBP, which is quantitatively supported by a phonon frequency analysis and\nfirst-principles calculations. Moreover, the CCM and another branch of\nlow-frequency Raman modes shift sensitively with changing number of layers,\nallowing an accurate determination of the thickness up to tens of atomic\nlayers, which is considerably higher than those previously achieved by using\nhigh-frequency Raman modes. These results offer fundamental insights and\npractical tools for exploring multilayer BP in new device applications.\n", "  A mechanism is proposed for the tantalizing evidence of polar Kerr effect in\na class of high temperature superconductors--the signs of the Kerr angle from\ntwo opposite faces of the same sample are identical and magnetic field training\nis non-existent. The mechanism does not break global time reversal symmetry, as\nin an antiferromagnet, and results in zero Faraday effect. It is best\nunderstood in a phenomenological model of bilayer cuprates, such as YBCO, in\nwhich intra-bilayer tunneling nucleates a chiral d-density wave such that the\nindividual layers have opposite chirality. Although specific to the chiral\nd-density wave, the mechanism may be more general to any quasi-two-dimensional\norbital antiferromagnet in which time reversal symmetry is broken in each\nplane, but not when averaged macroscopically.\n", "  A novel negative oxygen-isotope (16O/18O) effect (OIE) on the low-temperature\ntetragonal phase transition temperature T_{LTT} was observed in\nLa_{2-x}Ba_xCuO_4 (x = 1/8) using high-resolution neutron powder diffraction.\nThe corresponding OIE exponent alpha(T_{LTT}) = - 0.36(5) has the same sign as\nalpha(T_{so}) = -0.57(6) found for the spin-stripe order temperature T_so. The\nfact that the LTT transition is accompanied by charge ordering (CO) implies the\npresence of an OIE also for the CO temperature T_co. Furthermore, a temperature\ndependent shortening of the c-axis with the heavier isotope is observed. These\nresults combined with model calculations demonstrate that anharmonic\nelectron-lattice interactions are essential for all transitions observed in the\nstripe phase of cuprates.\n", "  We study an alternative approach to model the dynamical behaviors of\nbiological feedback loop, that is, a type-dependent spin system, this class of\nstochastic models was introduced by Fern\\'andez et. al (2009), and are useful\nsince take account to inherent variability of gene expression. We analyze a\nnon-symmetric feedback module being an extension for the repressilator, the\nfirst synthetic biological oscillator, invented by Elowitz and Leibler (2000).\nWe consider a mean-field dynamics for a type-dependent Ising model, and then\nstudy the empirical-magnetization vector representing concentration of\nmolecules. We apply a convergence result from stochastic jump processes to\ndeterministic trajectories and present a bifurcation analysis for the\nassociated dynamical system. We show that non-symmetric module under study can\nexhibit very rich behaviours, including the empirical oscillations described by\nrepressilator.\n", "  An exponential interaction is constructed so that one-dimensional atoms and\nchains of atoms mimic the general behavior of their three-dimensional\ncounterparts. Relative to the more commonly used soft-Coulomb interaction, the\nexponential greatly diminishes the computational time needed for calculating\nhighly accurate quantities with the density matrix renormalization group. This\nis due to the use of a small matrix product operator and to exponentially\nvanishing tails. Furthermore, its more rapid decay closely mimics the screened\nCoulomb interaction in three dimensions. Choosing parameters to best match\nearlier calculations, we report results for the one dimensional hydrogen atom,\nuniform gas, and small atoms and molecules both exactly and in the local\ndensity approximation.\n", "  Identifying the superconducting (SC) gap structure of the iron-based\nhigh-temperature superconductors (Fe-HTS's) remains a key issue for the\nunderstanding of superconductivity in these materials. In contrast to other\nunconventional superconductors, in the Fe-HTS's both $d$-wave and extended\ns-wave pairing symmetries are close in energy, with the latter believed to be\ngenerally favored over the former. Probing the proximity between these very\ndifferent SC states and identifying experimental parameters that can tune them,\nare of central interest. Here we report high-pressure muon spin rotation\nexperiments on the temperature-dependent magnetic penetration depth (lambda) in\nthe optimally doped Fe-HTS Ba_0.65Rb_0.35Fe_2As_2. At ambient pressure this\nmaterial is known to be a nodeless s-wave superconductor. Upon pressure a\nstrong decrease of (lambda) is observed, while the SC transition temperature\nremains nearly constant. More importantly, the low-temperature behavior of\n(1/lambda^{2}) changes from exponential saturation at zero pressure to a\npower-law with increasing pressure, providing unambiguous evidence that\nhydrostatic pressure promotes nodal SC gaps. Comparison to microscopic models\nfavors a d-wave over a nodal s^{+-}-wave pairing as the origin of the nodes.\nOur results provide a new route of understanding the complex topology of the SC\ngap in Fe-HTS's.\n", "  It is shown that the Unruh effect, i.e. the increase in temperature indicated\nby a uniformly accelerated thermometer in an inertial vacuum state of a quantum\nfield, cannot be interpreted as the result of an exchange of heat with a\nsurrounding gas. Since the vacuum is spatially homogeneous in the accelerated\nsystem its temperature must be zero everywhere as a consequence of Tolman's\nlaw. In fact, the increase of temperature of accelerated thermometers is due to\nsystematic quantum effects induced by the local coupling between the\nthermometer and the vacuum. This coupling inevitably creates excitations of the\nvacuum which transfer energy to the thermometer, gained by the acceleration,\nand thereby affect its readings. The temperature of the vacuum, however,\nremains to be zero for arbitrary accelerations.\n", "  Tensor network algorithms provide a suitable route for tackling real-time\ndependent problems in lattice gauge theories, enabling the investigation of\nout-of-equilibrium dynamics. We analyze a U(1) lattice gauge theory in (1+1)\ndimensions in the presence of dynamical matter for different mass and electric\nfield couplings, a theory akin to quantum-electrodynamics in one-dimension,\nwhich displays string-breaking: the confining string between charges can\nspontaneously break during quench experiments, giving rise to charge-anticharge\npairs according to the Schwinger mechanism. We study the real-time spreading of\nexcitations in the system by means of electric field and particle fluctuations:\nwe determine a dynamical state diagram for string breaking and quantitatively\nevaluate the time-scales for mass production. We also show that the time\nevolution of the quantum correlations can be detected via bipartite von Neumann\nentropies, thus demonstrating that the Schwinger mechanism is tightly linked to\nentanglement spreading. To present the variety of possible applications of this\nsimulation platform, we show how one could follow the real-time scattering\nprocesses between mesons and the creation of entanglement during scattering\nprocesses. Finally, we test the quality of quantum simulations of these\ndynamics, quantifying the role of possible imperfections in cold atoms, trapped\nions, and superconducting circuit systems. Our results demonstrate how\nentanglement properties can be used to deepen our understanding of basic\nphenomena in the real-time dynamics of gauge theories such as string breaking\nand collisions.\n", "  We study numerical methods for sampling probability measures in high\ndimension where the underlying model is only approximately identified with a\ngradient system. Extended stochastic dynamical methods are discussed which have\napplication to multiscale models, nonequilibrium molecular dynamics, and\nBayesian sampling techniques arising in emerging machine learning applications.\nIn addition to providing a more comprehensive discussion of the foundations of\nthese methods, we propose a new numerical method for the adaptive\nLangevin/stochastic gradient Nos\\'{e}--Hoover thermostat that achieves a\ndramatic improvement in numerical efficiency over the most popular stochastic\ngradient methods reported in the literature. We also demonstrate that the newly\nestablished method inherits a superconvergence property (fourth order\nconvergence to the invariant measure for configurational quantities) recently\ndemonstrated in the setting of Langevin dynamics. Our findings are verified by\nnumerical experiments.\n", "  Singularities are common features of general relativity black holes. However,\nwithin general relativity, one can construct black holes that present no\nsingularities. These regular black hole solutions can be achieved by, for\ninstance, relaxing one of the energy conditions on the stress energy tensor\nsourcing the black hole. Some regular black hole solutions were found in the\ncontext of non-linear electrodynamics, the Bardeen black hole being the first\none proposed. In this paper, we consider a planar massless scalar wave\nscattered by a Bardeen black hole. We compare the scattering cross section\ncomputed using a partial-wave description with the classical geodesic\nscattering of a stream of null geodesics, as well as with the semi-classical\nglory approximation. We obtain that, for some values of the corresponding black\nhole charge, the scattering cross section of a Bardeen black hole has a similar\ninterference pattern of a Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole.\n", "  We devise a scalable scheme for simulating a quantum phase transition from\nparamagnetism to frustrated magnetism in a superconducting flux-qubit network,\nand we show how to characterize this system experimentally both macroscopically\nand microscopically. The proposed macroscopic characterization of the quantum\nphase transition is based on the transition of the probability distribution for\nthe spin-network net magnetic moment with this transition quantified by the\ndifference between the Kullback-Leibler divergences of the distributions\ncorresponding to the paramagnetic and frustrated magnetic phases with respect\nto the probability distribution at a given time during the transition.\nMicroscopic characterization of the quantum phase transition is performed using\nthe standard local-entanglement-witness approach. Simultaneous macro and micro\ncharacterizations of quantum phase transitions would serve to verify a quantum\nphase transition in two ways especially in the quantum realm for the\nclassically intractable case of frustrated quantum magnetism.\n", "  We propose a geometrical treatment of symmetries in non-local field theories,\nwhere the non-locality is due to a lack of identification of field arguments in\nthe action. We show that the existence of a symmetry of the action leads to a\ngeneralised conservation law, in which the usual conserved current acquires an\nadditional non-local correction term, obtaining a generalisation of the\nstandard Noether theorem. We illustrate the general formalism by discussing the\nspecific physical example of complex scalar field theory of the type describing\nthe hydrodynamic approximation of Bose-Einstein condensates. We expect our\nanalysis and results to be of particular interest for the group field theory\nformulation of quantum gravity.\n", "  Hydrodynamic flow occurs in an electron liquid when the mean free path for\nelectron-electron collisions is the shortest length scale in the problem. In\nthis regime, transport is described by the Navier-Stokes equation, which\ncontains two fundamental parameters, the bulk and shear viscosities. In this\nArticle we present extensive results for these transport coefficients in the\ncase of the two-dimensional massless Dirac fermion liquid in a doped graphene\nsheet. Our approach relies on microscopic calculations of the viscosities up to\nsecond order in the strength of electron-electron interactions and in the\nhigh-frequency limit, where perturbation theory is applicable. We then use\nsimple interpolation formulae that allow to reach the low-frequency\nhydrodynamic regime where perturbation theory is no longer directly applicable.\nThe key ingredient for the interpolation formulae is the \"viscosity transport\ntime\" $\\tau_{\\rm v}$, which we calculate in this Article. The transverse nature\nof the excitations contributing to $\\tau_{\\rm v}$ leads to the suppression of\nscattering events with small momentum transfer, which are inherently\nlongitudinal. Therefore, contrary to the quasiparticle lifetime, which goes as\n$-1/[T^2 \\ln(T/T_{\\rm F})]$, in the low temperature limit we find $\\tau_{\\rm v}\n\\sim 1/T^2$.\n", "  In order to assess the short-term memory performance of non-linear random\nneural networks, we introduce a measure to quantify the dependence of a neural\nrepresentation upon the past context. We study this measure both numerically\nand theoretically using the mean-field theory for random neural networks,\nshowing the existence of an optimal level of synaptic weights heterogeneity. We\nfurther investigate the influence of the network topology, in particular the\nsymmetry of reciprocal synaptic connections, on this measure of context\ndependence, revealing the importance of considering the interplay between\nnon-linearities and connectivity structure.\n", "  We present a full description of the N-probability density function of the\ngalaxy number density fluctuations. This N-pdf is given in terms, on the one\nhand, of the cold dark matter correlations and, on the other hand, of the\ngalaxy bias parameter. The method relies on the assumption commonly adopted\nthat the dark matter density fluctuations follow a local non-linear\ntransformation of the initial energy density perturbations. The N-pdf of the\ngalaxy number density fluctuations allows for an optimal estimation of the bias\nparameter (e.g., via maximum-likelihood estimation, or Bayesian inference if\nthere exists any a priori information on the bias parameter), and of those\nparameters defining the dark matter correlations, in particular its amplitude\n($\\sigma_8$). It also provides the proper framework to perform model selection\nbetween two competitive hypotheses. The parameters estimation capabilities of\nthe N-pdf are proved by SDSS-like simulations (both ideal log-normal\nsimulations and mocks obtained from Las Damas simulations), showing that our\nestimator is unbiased. We apply our formalism to the 7th release of the SDSS\nmain sample (for a volume-limited subset with absolute magnitudes $M_r \\leq\n-20$). We obtain $\\hat{b} = 1.193 \\pm 0.074$ and $\\hat{\\sigma_8} = 0.862 \\pm\n0.080$, for galaxy number density fluctuations in cells of a size of\n$30h^{-1}$Mpc. Different model selection criteria show that galaxy biasing is\nclearly favoured.\n", "  A de Sitter black hole or a black hole spacetime endowed with a positive\ncosmological constant has two Killing horizons -- a black hole and a\ncosmological event horizon surrounding it. It is natural to expect that the\ntotal Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of such spacetimes should be the sum of the\ntwo horizons' areas. In this work we apply the recently developed formalism\nusing the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term and the near horizon symmetries to\nderive the total entropy of such two horizon spacetimes. We construct a\nsuitable general geometric set up for general stationary axisymmetric\nspacetimes with two or more than two commuting Killing vector fields in an\narbitrary spacetime dimensions. This framework helps us to deal with both the\nhorizons in an equal footing. We show that in order to obtain the total entropy\nof such spacetimes, the near horizon mode functions for the diffeomorphism\ngenerating vector fields have to be restricted in a certain manner, compared to\nthe single horizon spacetimes. We next discuss specific known exact solutions\nbelonging to the Kerr-Newman- or the Plebanski-Demianski-de Sitter families to\nshow that they fall into the category of our general framework. We end with a\nsketch of further possible extensions of this work.\n", "  Optimisation problems in science and engineering typically involve finding\nthe ground state (i.e. the minimum energy configuration) of a cost function\nwith respect to many variables. If the variables are corrupted by noise then\nthis approach maximises the likelihood that the solution found is correct. An\nalternative approach is to make use of prior statistical information about the\nnoise in conjunction with Bayes's theorem. The maximum entropy solution to the\nproblem then takes the form of a Boltzmann distribution over the ground and\nexcited states of the cost function. Here we use a programmable Josephson\njunction array for the information decoding problem which we simulate as a\nrandom Ising model in a field. We show experimentally that maximum entropy\ndecoding at finite temperature can in certain cases give competitive and even\nslightly better bit-error-rates than the maximum likelihood approach at zero\ntemperature, confirming that useful information can be extracted from the\nexcited states of the annealing device. Furthermore we introduce a microscopic\nbit-by-bit analytical method which is agnostic to the specific application and\nuse it to show that the annealing device samples from a highly Boltzmann-like\ndistribution. Machines of this kind are therefore candidates for use in a wide\nvariety of machine learning applications which exploit maximum entropy\ninference, including natural language processing and image recognition. We\nfurther show that the limiting factor for performance in our experiments is\nlikely to be control errors rather than failure to reach equilibrium. Our work\nalso provides a method for determining if a system is in equilibrium which can\nbe easily generalized. We discuss possible applications of this method to spin\nglasses and probing the performance of the quantum annealing algorithm.\n", "  We introduce a new density for the representation of quantum states on phase\nspace. It is constructed as a weighted difference of two smooth probability\ndensities using the Husimi function and first-order Hermite spectrograms. In\ncontrast to the Wigner function, it is accessible by sampling strategies for\npositive densities. In the semiclassical regime, the new density allows to\napproximate expectation values to second order with respect to the high\nfrequency parameter and is thus more accurate than the uncorrected Husimi\nfunction. As an application, we combine the new phase space density with\nEgorov's theorem for the numerical simulation of time-evolved quantum\nexpectations by an ensemble of classical trajectories. We present supporting\nnumerical experiments in different settings and dimensions.\n", "  In constructing his theorem, Bell assumed that correlation functions among\nnon-commuting variables are the same as those among commuting variables.\nHowever, in quantum mechanics, multiple data values exist simultaneously for\ncommuting operations while for non-commuting operations data are conditional on\nprior outcomes, or may be predicted as alternative outcomes of the\nnon-commuting operations. Given these qualitative differences, there is no\nreason why correlation functions among non-commuting variables should be the\nsame as those among commuting variables, as assumed by Bell. When data for\ncommuting and noncommuting operations are predicted from quantum mechanics,\ntheir correlations are different, and they now satisfy the Bell inequality.\n", "  Hybrid metal-organic perovskite solar cells have astounded the solar cell\ncommunity with their rapid rise in efficiency over the past three years.\nDespite this success, the basic processes governing the photogeneration of free\ncharges, particularly their dynamics and efficiency, remain unknown. Here we\nuse ultrabroadband pulses of THz frequency light to see the intrinsic\nphotophysical properties of single crystal lead halide perovskite just\nfemtoseconds after a photon is first absorbed. Our spectra reveal the dynamics\nand efficiencies of free charge creation, the remarkable ease in which they\nmove through the lattice and the complicated interplay between free and bound\ncharges in these materials.\n", "  We study the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure for cosmic\ndensity and momentum fields. We show that the finite part of the two-loop\ncalculation and its counterterms introduce an apparent scale dependence for the\nleading order parameter $c_\\text{s}^2$ of the EFT starting at k=0.1 h/Mpc.\nThese terms limit the range over which one can trust the one-loop EFT\ncalculation at the 1 % level to k<0.1 h/Mpc at redshift z=0. We construct a\nwell motivated one parameter ansatz to fix the relative size of the one- and\ntwo-loop counterterms using their high-k sensitivity. Although this one\nparameter model is a very restrictive choice for the counterterms, it explains\nthe apparent scale dependence of $c_\\text{s}^2$ seen in simulations. It is also\nable to capture the scale dependence of the density power spectrum up to\nk$\\approx$ 0.3 h/Mpc at the 1 % level at redshift $z=0$. Considering a simple\nscheme for the resummation of large scale motions, we find that the two loop\ncalculation reduces the need for this IR-resummation at k<0.2 h/Mpc. Finally,\nwe extend our calculation to momentum statistics and show that the same one\nparameter model can also describe density-momentum and momentum-momentum\nstatistics.\n", "  Maximally synchronizable networks (MSNs) are acyclic directed networks that\nmaximize synchronizability. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of\ntransforming networks of coupled oscillators into their corresponding MSNs. By\ntuning the weights of any given network so as to reach the lowest possible\neigenratio $\\lambda_N/\\lambda_2$, the synchronized state is guaranteed to be\nmaintained across the longest possible range of coupling strengths. We check\nthe robustness of the resulting MSNs with an experimental implementation of a\nnetwork of nonlinear electronic oscillators and study the propagation of the\nsynchronization errors through the network. Importantly, a method to study the\neffects of topological uncertainties on the synchronizability is proposed and\nexplored both theoretically and experimentally.\n", "  We determine the size of the critical region of the superfluid transition in\nthe BCS-BEC crossover of a three-dimensional fermion gas, using a\nrenormalization-group approach to a bosonic theory of pairing fluctuations. For\nthe unitary Fermi gas, we find a sizable critical region $[T_G^-,T_G^+]$, of\norder $T_c$, around the transition temperature $T_c$ with a pronounced\nasymmetry: $|T_G^+-T_c|/|T_G^--T_c|\\sim8$. The critical region is strongly\nsuppressed on the BCS side of the crossover but remains important on the BEC\nside.\n", "  Rotational shear layers at the boundary between radiative and convective\nzones, tachoclines, play a key role in the process of magnetic field generation\nin solar-like stars. We present two sets of global simulations of rotating\nturbulent convection and dynamo. The first set considers a stellar convective\nenvelope only; the second one, aiming at the formation of a tachocline,\nconsiders also the upper part of the radiative zone. Our results indicate that\nthe resulting mean-flows and dynamo properties like the growth rate, saturation\nenergy and mode depend on the Rossby (Ro) number. For the first set of models\neither oscillatory (with ~2 yr period) or steady dynamo solutions are obtained.\nThe models in the second set naturally develop a tachocline which, in turn,\nleads to the generation of strong mean magnetic field. Since the field is also\ndeposited into the stable deeper layer, its evolutionary time-scale is much\nlonger than in the models without a tachocline. Surprisingly, the magnetic\nfield in the upper turbulent convection zone evolves in the same time scale as\nthe deep field. These models result in either an oscillatory dynamo with ~30 yr\nperiod or in a steady dynamo depending on Ro. In terms of the mean-field dynamo\ncoefficients computed using FOSA, the field evolution in the oscillatory models\nwithout a tachocline seems to be consistent with dynamo waves propagating\naccording to the Parker-Yoshimura sign rule. In the models with tachoclines the\ndynamics is more complex involving other transport mechanisms as well as\ntachocline instabilities.\n", "  The LARES satellite, a laser-ranged space experiment to contribute to\ngeophysics observation, and to measure the general relativistic Lense-Thirring\neffect, has been observed to undergo an anomalous along-track orbital\nacceleration of -0.4 pm/s$^2$ (pm := picometer). This \"drag\" is not surprising;\nalong track drag has previously been observed with the related LAGEOS\nsatellites (-3.4 pm/s$^2$). It is hypothesized that the drag is principally due\nto anisotropic thermal radiation from the satellite's exterior. We report the\nresults of numerical computations of the along-track orbital decay of the LARES\nsatellite during the first 126 days after launch. The results depend to a\nsignificant degree on the visual and IR absorbance $\\alpha$ and emissivity\n$\\epsilon$ of the fused silica Cube Corner Reflectors. We present results for\ntwo values of $\\alpha_{IR}$ = $\\epsilon_{IR}$: 0.82, a standard number for\n\"clean\" fused silica; and 0.60, a possible value for silica with slight surface\ncontamination subjected to the space environment. The heating and the resultant\nalong-track acceleration depend on the plane of the orbit, the sun position,\nand in particular on the occurrence of eclipses, all of which are functions of\ntime. Thus we compute the drag for specific days. We compare our model to\nobservational data, available for a 120-day period starting with the 7th day\nafter launch, which shows the average acceleration of -0.4 pm/s$^2$. With our\nmodel the average along-track drag over this 120-day period for CCR\n$\\alpha_{IR}$ = $\\epsilon_{IR}$ = 0.82 was computed to be -0.59 pm/s$^2$. For\nCCR $\\alpha_{IR}$ = $\\epsilon_{IR}$ = 0.60 we compute -0.36 pm/s$^2$. Thus, our\nmodel demonstrates that most of the anomalous along-track acceleration can be\nexplained by thermal thrust, but there could be smaller contributions from\nunmodelled effects.\n", "  We present a new, robust measurement of the evolving rest-frame UV galaxy\nluminosity function (LF) over the key redshift range z = 2 - 4. Our results are\nbased on the high dynamic range provided by combining the HUDF,\nCANDELS/GOODS-South, and UltraVISTA/COSMOS surveys. We utilise the unparalleled\nmulti-frequency photometry available in this survey `wedding cake' to compile\ncomplete galaxy samples at z ~ 2,3,4 via photometric redshifts (calibrated\nagainst the latest spectroscopy) rather than colour-colour selection, and to\ndetermine accurate rest-frame UV absolute magnitudes from SED fitting. Our new\ndeterminations of the UV LF extend from M_{1500} ~ -22 down to M_{1500} =\n-14.5, -15.5 and -16 at z ~ 2, 3 and 4 respectively (thus reaching ~ 3 - 4\nmagnitudes fainter than previous blank-field studies at z ~ 2 - 3). At z ~ 2 -\n3 we find a much shallower faint-end slope (alpha = -1.32 +- 0.03) than the\nsteeper values (alpha ~ -1.7) reported by Reddy & Steidel (2009) or by Alavi et\nal. (2014), and show that this new measurement is robust. By z ~ 4 the\nfaint-end slope has steepened slightly, to alpha = -1.43 +- 0.04, and we show\nthat these measurements are consistent with the overall evolutionary trend from\nz = 0 to z = 8. Finally, we find that while characteristic number density\n(phi*) drops from z ~ 2 to z ~ 4, characteristic luminosity (M*) brightens by ~\n1 mag over this redshift range. This, combined with the new flatter faint-end\nslopes, has the consequence that UV luminosity density (and hence unobscured\nstar-formation density) peaks at z ~ 2.5 - 3, when the Universe was ~ 2.5 Gyr\nold.\n", "  A search is presented for a high-mass Higgs boson in the\n$H\\rightarrow\\ell\\ell\\ell\\ell$, $H\\rightarrow\\ell\\ell\\nu\\nu$,\n$H\\rightarrow\\ell\\ell qq$, and $H\\rightarrow\\nu\\nu qq$ decay modes using the\nATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The search uses proton-proton\ncollision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV corresponding to an\nintegrated luminosity of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$. The results of the search are\ninterpreted in the scenario of a heavy Higgs boson with a width that is small\ncompared with the experimental mass resolution. The Higgs boson mass range\nconsidered extends up to 1 TeV for all four decay modes and down to as low as\n140 GeV, depending on the decay mode. No significant excess of events over the\nStandard Model prediction is found. A simultaneous fit to the four decay modes\nyields upper limits on the production cross-section of a heavy Higgs boson\ntimes the branching ratio to Z boson pairs. 95% confidence level upper limits\nrange from 0.53 pb at $m_H=195$ GeV to 0.008 pb at $m_H=950$ GeV for the\ngluon-fusion production mode and from 0.31 pb at $m_H=195$ GeV to 0.009 pb at\n$m_H=950$ GeV for the vector-boson-fusion production mode. The results are also\ninterpreted in the context of Type-I and Type-II two-Higgs-doublet models.\n", "  We design freeform lenses refracting an arbitrarily given incident field into\na given fixed direction. In the near field case, we study the existence of\nlenses refracting a given bright object into a predefined image. We also\nanalyze the existence of systems of mirrors that solve the near field and the\nfar field problems for reflection.\n", "  We show that the order-disorder phase transition in the three state Potts\nferromagnet on a square lattice is driven by a coupled proliferation of\nvortices and domain walls. Raising the vortex core energy above a certain value\ndecouples the proliferation and splits the transition into two. The phase\nbetween the two transitions exhibits an emergent U(1) symmetry and quasi long\nrange order. Lowering the core energy also splits the order-disorder transition\nbut the proliferation does not decouple and a vortex lattice appears as the\nintermediate phase.\n", "  We propose a quantum algorithm for many-body state preparation. It is\nespecially suited for injective PEPS and thermal states of local commuting\nHamiltonians on a lattice. We show that for a uniform gap and sufficiently\nsmooth paths, an adiabatic runtime and circuit depth of\n$O(\\operatorname{polylog}N)$ can be achieved for $O(N)$ spins. This is an\nalmost exponential improvement over previous bounds. The total number of\nelementary gates scales as $O(N\\operatorname{polylog}N)$. This is also faster\nthan the best known upper bound of $O(N^2)$ on the mixing times of Monte Carlo\nMarkov chain algorithms for sampling classical systems in thermal equilibrium.\n", "  A new approach to obtain the closure formulas for the von K\\'arm\\'an--Howarth\nand Corrsin equations is presented, which is based on the Lagrangian\nrepresentation of the fluid motion, and on the Liouville theorem associated to\nthe kinematics of a pair of fluid particles. This kinematics, characterized by\nthe finite--scale separation vector, is assumed to be statistically independent\nfrom the velocity field. Such assumption is justified by the hypothesis of\nfully developed turbulence and by the property that this vector varies much\nmore rapidly than the velocity field. This formulation leads to the closure\nformulas of von K\\'arm\\'an--Howarth and Corrsin equations in terms of\nlongitudinal velocity and temperature correlations following a demonstration\ncompletely different with respect to the previous works. Some of the properties\nand the limitations of the closed equations are discussed. In particular, the\ntimes of evolution of the developed kinetic energy and temperature spectra are\nshown to be finite quantities which depend on the initial conditions.\n", "  There are both practical and foundational motivations to consider the\nthermodynamics of quantum systems at small scales. Here we address the issue of\nautonomous quantum thermal machines that are tailored to achieve some specific\nthermodynamic primitive, such as work extraction in the presence of a thermal\nenvironment, while having minimal or no control from the macroscopic regime.\nBeyond experimental implementations, this provides an arena in which to address\ncertain foundational aspects such as the role of coherence in thermodynamics,\nthe use of clock degrees of freedom and the simulation of local time-dependent\nHamiltonians in a particular quantum subsystem. For small-scale systems\nadditional issues arise. Firstly, it is not clear to what degree genuine\nordered thermodynamic work has been extracted, and secondly non-trivial\nback-actions on the thermal machine must be accounted for. We find that both\nthese aspects can be resolved through a judicious choice of quantum\nmeasurements that magnify thermodynamic properties up the ladder of\nlength-scales, while simultaneously stabilizing the quantum thermal machine.\nWithin this framework we show that thermodynamic reversibility is obtained in a\nparticular Zeno limit, and finally illustrate these concepts with a concrete\nexample involving spin-systems.\n", "  Many real-world networks exhibit degree-assortativity, with nodes of similar\ndegree more likely to link to one another. Particularly in social networks, the\ncontribution to the total assortativity varies with degree, featuring a\ndistinctive peak slightly past the average degree. The way traditional models\nimprint assortativity on top of pre-defined topologies is via degree-preserving\nlink permutations, which however destroy the particular graph's hierarchical\ntraits of clustering. Here, we propose the first generative model which creates\nheterogeneous networks with scale-free-like properties and tunable realistic\nassortativity. In our approach, two distinct populations of nodes are added to\nan initial network seed: one (the followers) that abides by usual preferential\nrules, and one (the potential leaders) connecting via anti-preferential\nattachments, i.e. selecting lower degree nodes for their initial links. The\nlatter nodes come to develop a higher average degree, and convert eventually\ninto the final hubs. Examining the evolution of links in Facebook, we present\nempirical validation for the connection between the initial anti-preferential\nattachment and long term high degree. Thus, our work sheds new light on the\nstructure and evolution of social networks.\n", "  Central compact objects (CCOs) are thought to be young thermally emitting\nisolated neutron stars that were born during the preceding core-collapse\nsupernova explosion. Here we present evidence that at least in one case the CCO\ncould have been formed within a binary system. We show that the highly reddened\noptical source IRAS~17287$-$3443, located $25^{\\prime \\prime}$ away from the\nCCO candidate XMMUJ173203.3$-$344518 and classified previously as a post\nasymptotic giant branch star, is indeed surrounded by a dust shell. This shell\nis heated by the central star to temperatures of $\\sim90$\\,K and observed as\nextended infrared emission in 8-160\\,$\\mu$m band. The dust temperature also\nincreases in the vicinity of the CCO which implies that it likely resides\nwithin the shell. We estimate the total dust mass to be $\\sim0.4-1.5\\,M_\\odot$\nwhich significantly exceeds expected dust yields by normal stars and thus\nlikely condensed from supernova ejecta. Taking into account that both the age\nof the supernova remnant and the duration of active mass loss phase by the\noptical star are much shorter than the total lifetime of either object, the\nsupernova and the onset of the active mass loss phase of the companion have\nlikely occurred approximately simultaneously. This is most easily explained if\nthe evolution of both objects is interconnected. We conclude, therefore, that\nboth stars were likely members of the same binary system disrupted by a\nsupernova.\n", "  A perfect-fluid space-time of dimension n>3 with 1) irrotational velocity\nvector field, 2) null divergence of the Weyl tensor, is a generalised\nRobertson-Walker space-time with Einstein fiber. Condition 1) is verified\nwhenever pressure and energy density are related by an equation of state. The\ncontraction of the Weyl tensor with the velocity vector field is zero.\nConversely, a generalized Robertson-Walker space-time with null divergence of\nthe Weyl tensor is a perfect-fluid space-time.\n", "  We investigate the interplay between long-range and direct photon-assisted\ntransport in a triple quantum dot chain where local ac voltages are applied to\nthe outer dots. We propose the phase difference between the two ac voltages as\nan external parameter, which can be easily tuned to manipulate the current\ncharacteristics. For gate voltages in phase opposition we find quantum\ndestructive interferences analogous to the interferences in closed-loop\nundriven triple dots. As the voltages oscillate in phase, interferences between\nmultiple paths give rise to dark states. Those totally cancel the current, and\ncould be experimentally resolved.\n", "  We present optical, radio and X-ray data that confirm a new supernova remnant\n(SNR) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) discovered using our deep H-alpha\nimagery. Optically, the new SNR has a somewhat filamentary morphology and a\ndiameter of 56 x 64 arcsec (13.5 x 15.5 pc at the 49.9 kpc distance of the\nLMC). Spectroscopic follow-up of multiple regions show high [SII]/H-alpha\nemission-line ratios ranging from 0.66+/-0.02 to 0.93+/-0.01, all of which are\ntypical of an SNR. We found radio counterparts for this object using our new\nAustralia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) 6cm pointed observations as well as a\nnumber of available radio surveys at 8 640 MHz, 4 850 MHz, 1 377 MHz and 843\nMHz. With these combined data we provide a spectral index (alpha) = -0.5\nbetween 843 and 8640 MHz. Both spectral line analysis and the magnetic field\nstrength, ranging from 124 - 184 mG, suggest a dynamical age between 2,200 and\n4,700 yrs. The SNR has a previously catalogued X-ray counterpart listed as HP\n483 in the ROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) catalogue.\n", "  We numerically study an anisotropic shape transformation of membranes under\nexternal forces for two-dimensional triangulated surfaces on the basis of\nFinsler geometry. The Finsler metric is defined by using a vector field, which\nis the tangential component of a three dimensional unit vector $\\sigma$\ncorresponding to the tilt or some external macromolecules on the surface of\ndisk topology. The sigma model Hamiltonian is assumed for the tangential\ncomponent of $\\sigma$ with the interaction coefficient $\\lambda$. For large\n(small) $\\lambda$, the surface becomes oblong (collapsed) at relatively small\nbending rigidity. For the intermediate $\\lambda$, the surface becomes planar.\nConversely, fixing the surface with the boundary of area $A$ or with the two\npoint boundaries of distance $L$, we find that the variable $\\sigma$ changes\nfrom random to aligned state with increasing of $A$ or $L$ for the intermediate\nregion of $\\lambda$. This implies that an internal phase transition for\n$\\sigma$ is triggered not only by the thermal fluctuations but also by external\nmechanical forces. We also find that the frame (string) tension shows the\nexpected scaling behavior with respect to $A/N$ ($L/N$) at the intermediate\nregion of $A$ ($L$) where the $\\sigma$ configuration changes between the\ndisordered and ordered phases. Moreover, we find that the string tension\n$\\gamma$ at sufficiently large $\\lambda$ is considerably smaller than that at\nsmall $\\lambda$. This phenomenon resembles the so-called soft-elasticity in the\nliquid crystal elastomer, which is deformed by small external tensile forces.\n", "  We present evidence for Mott quantum criticality in an anisotropic\ntwo-dimensional system of coupled Hubbard chains at half-filling. In this\nscenario emerging from variational cluster approximation and cluster dynamical\nmean-field theory, the interchain hopping $t_{\\perp}$ acts as a control\nparameter driving the second-order critical end point $T_c$ of the\nmetal-insulator transition down to zero at $t_{\\perp}^{c}/t\\simeq 0.2$. Below\n$t_{\\perp}^{c}$, the volume of the hole and electron Fermi pockets of a\ncompensated metal vanishes continuously at the Mott transition. Above\n$t_{\\perp}^{c}$, the volume reduction of the pockets is cut off by a\nfirst-order transition. We discuss the relevance of our findings to a putative\nquantum critical point in layered organic conductors, whose location remains\nelusive so far.\n", "  We present a universal nanomechanical sensing platform for the investigation\nof magnetostriction in thin films. It is based on a doubly-clamped silicon\nnitride nanobeam resonator covered with a thin magnetostrictive film. Changing\nthe magnetization direction within the film plane by an applied magnetic field\ngenerates a magnetostrictive stress and thus changes the resonance frequency of\nthe nanobeam. A measurement of the resulting resonance frequency shift, e.g. by\noptical interferometry, allows to quantitatively determine the magnetostriction\nconstants of the thin film. We use this method to determine the\nmagnetostriction constants of a 10nm thick polycrystalline cobalt film, showing\nvery good agreement with literature values. The presented technique can be\nuseful in particular for the precise measurement of magnetostriction in a\nvariety of (conducting and insulating) thin films, which can be deposited by\ne.g. electron beam deposition, thermal evaporation or sputtering.\n", "  We derive a trace formula that expresses the level density of chaotic\nmany-body systems as a smooth term plus a sum over contributions associated to\nsolutions of the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (or Gross-Pitaevski) equation. Our\nformula applies to bosonic systems with discretised positions, such as the\nBose-Hubbard model, in the semiclassical limit as well as in the limit where\nthe number of particles is taken to infinity. We use the trace formula to\ninvestigate the spectral statistics of these systems, by studying interference\nbetween solutions of the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation. We show that in the\nlimits taken the statistics of fully chaotic many-particle systems becomes\nuniversal and agrees with predictions from the Wigner-Dyson ensembles of random\nmatrix theory. The conditions for Wigner-Dyson statistics involve a gap in the\nspectrum of the Frobenius-Perron operator, leaving the possibility of different\nstatistics for systems with weaker chaotic properties.\n", "  Quantum mechanics predicts a number of at first sight counterintuitive\nphenomena. It is therefore a question whether our intuition is the best way to\nfind new experiments. Here we report the development of the computer algorithm\nMelvin which is able to find new experimental implementations for the creation\nand manipulation of complex quantum states. And indeed, the discovered\nexperiments extensively use unfamiliar and asymmetric techniques which are\nchallenging to understand intuitively. The results range from the first\nimplementation of a high-dimensional Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state,\nto a vast variety of experiments for asymmetrically entangled quantum states --\na feature that can only exist when both the number of involved parties and\ndimensions is larger than 2. Additionally, new types of high-dimensional\ntransformations are found that perform cyclic operations. Melvin autonomously\nlearns from solutions for simpler systems, which significantly speeds up the\ndiscovery rate of more complex experiments. The ability to automate the design\nof a quantum experiment can be applied to many quantum systems and allows the\nphysical realization of quantum states previously thought of only on paper.\n", "  Network analysis has become an increasingly prevalent research tool across a\nvast range of scientific fields. Here, we focus on the particular issue of\ncomparing network statistics, i.e. graph-level measures of network structural\nfeatures, across multiple networks that differ in size. Although \"normalized\"\nversions of some network statistics exist, we demonstrate via simulation why\ndirect comparison of raw and normalized statistics is often inappropriate. We\nexamine a recent suggestion to normalize network statistics relative to\nErdos-Renyi random graphs and demonstrate via simulation how this is an\nimprovement over direct comparison, but still sometimes problematic. We propose\na new adjustment method based on a reference distribution constructed as a\nmixture model of random graphs which reflect the dependence structure exhibited\nin the observed networks. We show that using simple Bernoulli models as mixture\ncomponents in this reference distribution can provide adjusted network\nstatistics that are relatively comparable across different network sizes but\nstill describe interesting features of networks, and that this can be\naccomplished at relatively low computational expense. Finally, we apply this\nmethodology to a collection of co-location networks derived from the Los\nAngeles Family and Neighborhood Survey activity location data.\n", "  We show how the standard field theoretical language based on creation and\nannihilation operators may be used for a straightforward derivation of closed\nmaster equations describing the population dynamics of multivariate stochastic\nepidemic models. In order to do that, we introduce an SIR-inspired stochastic\nmodel for hepatitis C virus epidemic, from which we obtain the time evolution\nof the mean number of susceptible, infected, recovered and chronically infected\nindividuals in a population whose total size is allowed to change.\n", "  A search for pair production of first and second generation leptoquarks is\nperformed in final states containing either two charged leptons and two jets,\nor one charged lepton, one neutrino and two jets, using proton-proton collision\ndata at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV. The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\n19.7 inverse femtobarns were recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC.\nFirst-generation scalar leptoquarks with masses less than 1010 (850) GeV are\nexcluded for beta = 1.0 (0.5), where beta is the branching fraction of a\nleptoquark decaying to a charged lepton and a quark. Similarly,\nsecond-generation scalar leptoquarks with masses less than 1080 (760) GeV are\nexcluded for beta = 1.0 (0.5). Mass limits are also set for vector leptoquark\nproduction scenarios with anomalous vector couplings, and for R-parity\nviolating supersymmetric scenarios of top squark pair production resulting in\nsimilar final-state signatures. These are the most stringent limits placed on\nthe masses of leptoquarks and RPV top squarks to date.\n", "  We consider recurrent contagious processes on a time-varying network. As a\ncontrol procedure to mitigate the epidemic, we propose an adaptive rewiring\nmechanism for temporary isolation of infected nodes upon their detection. As a\ncase study, we investigate the network of pig trade in Germany. Based on\nextensive numerical simulations for a wide range of parameters, we demonstrate\nthat the adaptation mechanism leads to a significant extension of the parameter\nrange, for which most of the index nodes (origins of the epidemic) lead to\nvanishing epidemics. Furthermore the performance of adaptation is very\nheterogeneous with respect to the index node. We quantify the success of the\nproposed adaptation scheme in dependence on the infectious period and the\ndetection time. To support our findings we propose a mean-field analytical\ndescription of the problem.\n", "  In the absence of a global description of the experimental data on elastic\nand soft diffractive scattering from the first principles of QCD,\nmodel-independent analyses may provide useful phenomenological insights for the\ndevelopment of the theory in the soft sector. With that in mind, we present an\nempirical study on the energy dependence of the ratio $X$ between the elastic\nand total cross sections; a quantity related to the evolution of the hadronic\ncentral opacity. The dataset comprises all the experimental information\navailable on proton-proton and antiproton-proton scattering in the c.m. energy\ninterval 5 GeV - 8 TeV. Generalizing previous works, we discuss four\nmodel-independent analytical parameterizations for $X$, consisting of sigmoid\nfunctions composed with elementary functions of the energy and three distinct\nasymptotic scenarios: either the standard black disk limit or scenarios above\nor below that limit. Our two main conclusions are the following: (1) although\nconsistent with the experimental data, the black disk does not represent an\nunique solution; (2) the data reductions favor a semi-transparent scenario,\nwith asymptotic average value for the ratio $\\bar{X}$ = 0.30 $\\pm$ 0.12. In\nthis case, within the uncertainty, the asymptotic regime may already be reached\naround 1000 TeV. We present a comparative study of the two scenarios, including\npredictions for the inelastic channel (diffraction dissociation) and the ratio\nassociated with the total cross-section and the elastic slope. Details on the\nselection of our empirical ansatz for $X$ and physical aspects related to a\nchange of curvature in this quantity at 80 - 100 GeV, indicating the beginning\nof a saturation effect, are also presented and discussed.\n", "  We introduce a class of 3D color codes, which we call stacked codes, together\nwith a fault-tolerant transformation that will map logical qubits encoded in\ntwo-dimensional (2D) color codes into stacked codes and back. The stacked code\nallows for the transversal implementation of a non-Clifford $\\pi/8$ logical\ngate, which when combined with the logical Clifford gates that are transversal\nin the 2D color code give a gate set which is both fault-tolerant and universal\nwithout requiring nonstabilizer magic states. We then show that the layers\nforming the stacked code can be unfolded and arranged in a 2D layout. As only\nClifford gates can be implemented transversally for 2D topological stabilizer\ncodes, a non-local operation must be incorporated in order to allow for this\ntransversal application of a non-Clifford gate. Our code achieves this\noperation through the transformation from a 2D color code to the unfolded\nstacked code induced by measuring only geometrically local stabilizers and\ngauge operators within the bulk of 2D color codes together with a nonlocal\noperator that has support on a one-dimensional boundary between such 2D codes.\nWe believe that this proposed method to implement the non-local operation is a\nrealistic one for 2D stabilizer layouts and would be beneficial in avoiding the\nlarge overheads caused by magic state distillation.\n", "  We introduce the quantum stochastic differential equation (QSDE) approach to\nexactly analyze of the response of quantum systems to a continuous-mode\ntwo-photon input. The QSDE description of the two-photon process allows us to\nintegrate the input-output analysis with the quantum network theory, and so the\nanalytical computability of the output state of a general quantum system can be\naddressed within this framework. We show that the time-domain two-photon output\nstates can be exactly calculated for a large class of quantum systems including\npassive linear networks, optomechanical oscillators and two-level emitter in\nwaveguide systems. In particular, we propose to utilize the results for the\nexact simulation of the stimulated emission as well as the study of the\nscattering of two-mode photon wave packets.\n", "  Using a framework based on the $1+3$ formalism we carry out a study on\naxially and reflection symmetric dissipative fluids, in the quasi--static\nregime. We first derive a set of invariantly defined \"velocities\", which allow\nfor an inambiguous definition of the quasi--static approximation. Next we\nrewrite all the relevant equations in this aproximation and extract all the\npossible, physically relevant, consequences ensuing the adoption of such an\napproximation. In particular we show how the vorticity, the shear and the\ndissipative flux, may lead to situations where different kind of \"velocities\"\nchange of sign within the fluid distribution with respect to theirs sign on the\nboundary surface. It is shown that states of gravitational radiation are not\n{\\it a priori} incompatible with the quasistatic--regime. However, any such\nstate must last for an infinite period of time, thereby diminishing its\nphysical relevance.\n", "  Solution growth of single crystals from high temperature solutions often\ninvolves the separation of residual solution from the grown crystals. For many\ngrowths of intermetallic compounds, this separation has historically been\nachieved with the use of plugs of silica wool. Whereas this is generally\nefficient in a mechanical sense, it leads to a significant contamination of the\ndecanted liquid with silica fibers. In this paper we present a simple design\nfor frit-disc alumina crucible sets that has made their use in the growth\nsingle crystals from high temperature solutions both simple and affordable. An\nalumina frit-disc allows for the clean separation of the residual liquid from\nthe solid phase. This allows for the reuse of the decanted liquid, either for\nfurther growth of the same phase, or for subsequent growth of other, related\nphases. In this paper we provide examples of the growth of isotopically\nsubstituted TbCd$_{6}$ and icosahedral i-$R$Cd quasicrystals, as well as the\nseparation of (i) the closely related Bi$_{2}$Rh$_{3}$S$_{2}$ and\nBi$_{2}$Rh$_{3.5}$S$_{2}$ phases and (ii) PrZn$_{11}$ and Pr$_{2}$Zn$_{17}$.\n", "  We introduce an effective tight-binding model to discuss penta-graphene and\npresent an analytical solution. This model only involves the $\\pi$-orbitals of\nthe sp$^2$-hybridized carbon atoms and reproduces the two highest valence\nbands. By introducing energy-dependent hopping elements, originating from the\nelimination of the sp$^3$-hybridized carbon atoms, also the two lowest\nconduction bands can be well approximated - but only after the inclusion of a\nHubbard onsite interaction as well as of assisted hopping terms. The\neigenfunctions can be approximated analytically for the effective model without\nenergy-dependent hopping elements and the optical absorption is discussed. We\nfind large isotropic absorption of up to 24\\% for transitions at the\n$\\Gamma$-point, but the general absorption will show a strongly anisotropic\nbehaviour depending on the linear polarization of the incident light.\n", "  Molybdenum rhenium alloy thin films can exhibit superconductivity up to\ncritical temperatures of $T_c=15\\mathrm{K}$. At the same time, the films are\nhighly stable in the high-temperature methane / hydrogen atmosphere typically\nrequired to grow single wall carbon nanotubes. We characterize molybdenum\nrhenium alloy films deposited via simultaneous sputtering from two sources,\nwith respect to their composition as function of sputter parameters and their\nelectronic dc as well as GHz properties at low temperature. Specific emphasis\nis placed on the effect of the carbon nanotube growth conditions on the film.\nSuperconducting coplanar waveguide resonators are defined lithographically; we\ndemonstrate that the resonators remain functional when undergoing nanotube\ngrowth conditions, and characterize their properties as function of\ntemperature. This paves the way for ultra-clean nanotube devices grown in situ\nonto superconducting coplanar waveguide circuit elements.\n", "  We propose and study a model of hypothetical magnetosensitive ionic channels\nwhich are long thought to be a possible candidate to explain the influence of\nweak magnetic fields on living organisms ranging from magnetotactic bacteria to\nfishes, birds, rats, bats and other mammals including humans. The core of the\nmodel is provided by a short chain of magnetosomes serving as a sensor which is\ncoupled by elastic linkers to the gating elements of ion channels forming a\nsmall cluster in the cell membrane. The magnetic sensor is fixed by one end on\ncytoskeleton elements attached to the membrane and is exposed to viscoelastic\ncytosol. Its free end can reorient stochastically and subdiffusively in\nviscoelastic cytosol responding to external magnetic field changes and open the\ngates of coupled ion channels. The sensor dynamics is generally bistable due to\nbistability of the gates which can be in two states with probabilities which\ndepend on the sensor orientation. For realistic parameters, it is shown that\nthis model channel can operate in the magnetic field of Earth for a small\nnumber (5 to 7) of single-domain magnetosomes constituting the sensor rod each\nof which has a typical size found in magnetotactic bacteria and other\norganisms, or even just one sufficiently large nanoparticle of a characteristic\nsize also found in nature. It is shown that due to viscoelasticity of medium\nthe bistable gating dynamics generally exhibits power law and stretched\nexponential distributions of the residence times of the channels in their open\nand closed states. This provides a generic physical mechanism for explanation\nof the origin of such anomalous kinetics for other ionic channels whose sensors\nmove in viscoelastic environment provided by either cytosol or biological\nmembrane, in a quite general context, beyond the fascinating hypothesis of\nmagnetosensitive ionic channels we explore.\n", "  The main physical features and operating principles of isothermal\nnanomachines in microworld are reviewed, which are common for both classical\nand quantum machines. Especial attention is paid to the dual and constructive\nrole of dissipation and thermal fluctuations, fluctuation-dissipation theorem,\nheat losses and free energy transduction, thermodynamic efficiency, and\nthermodynamic efficiency at maximum power. Several basic models are considered\nand discussed to highlight generic physical features. Our exposition allows to\nspot some common fallacies which continue to plague the literature, in\nparticular, erroneous beliefs that one should minimize friction and lower the\ntemperature to arrive at a high performance of Brownian machines, and that\nthermodynamic efficiency at maximum power cannot exceed one-half. The emerging\ntopic of anomalous molecular motors operating sub-diffusively but highly\nefficiently in viscoelastic environment of living cells is also discussed.\n", "  The controlled transfer of particles from one site of a spatial lattice to\nanother is essential for many tasks in quantum information processing and\nquantum communication. Arrays of semiconductor quantum dots and ultracold atoms\nheld in optical lattices, provide two means of studying coherent quantum\ntransport in well-controlled systems. In this work we study how to induce\nlong-range transfer between the two ends of a dimer chain, by coupling states\nthat are localized just on the chain's end-points. This has the appealing\nfeature that the transfer occurs only between the end-points -- the particle\ndoes not pass through the intermediate sites -- making the transfer less\nsusceptible to decoherence. We first show how a repulsively bound-pair of\nfermions, known as a doublon, can be transferred from one end of the chain to\nthe other via topological edge states. We then show how non-topological surface\nstates of the familiar Shockley or Tamm type can be used to produce a similar\nform of transfer under the action of a periodic driving potential. Finally we\nshow that combining these effects can produce transfer by means of more exotic\ntopological effects, in which the driving field can be used to switch the\ntopological character of the edge states, as measured by the Zak phase. Our\nresults demonstrate how to induce long range transfer of strongly correlated\nparticles by tuning both topology and driving.\n", "  We report Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillation measurements on FeSe under high\npressure up to $P$ = 16.1 kbar. We find a sudden change in SdH oscillations at\nthe onset of the pressure-induced antiferromagnetism at $P$ $\\sim$ 8 kbar. We\nargue that this change can be attributed to a reconstruction of the Fermi\nsurface by the antiferromagnetic order. The negative d$T_c$/d$P$ observed in a\nrange between $P$ $\\sim$ 8 and 12 kbar may be explained by the reduction in the\ndensity of states due to the reconstruction. The ratio of the transition\ntemperature to the effective Fermi energy remains high under high pressure:\n$k_BT_c/E_F$ $\\sim$ 0.1 even at $P$ = 16.1 kbar.\n", "  We develop a formalism for modelling the impact of dark matter subhaloes on\ncold thin streams. Our formalism models the formation of a gap in a stream in\nangle-frequency space and is able to handle general stream and impact geometry.\nWe analyse an $N$-body simulation of a cold stream formed from a progenitor on\nan eccentric orbit in an axisymmetric potential, which is perturbed by a direct\nimpact from a $10^8 M_\\odot$ subhalo, and produce a complete generative model\nof the perturbed stream that matches the simulation well at a range of times.\nWe show how the results in angle-frequency space can be related to physical\nproperties of the gaps and that previous results for more constrained\nsimulations are recovered. We demonstrate how our results are dependent upon\nthe mass of the subhalo and the location of the impact along the stream. We\nfind that gaps formed far downstream grow more rapidly than those closer to the\nprogenitor due to the more ordered nature of the stream members far from the\nprogenitor. Additionally, we show that the minimum gap density plateaus in time\nat a value that decreases with increasing subhalo mass.\n", "  Interactions between localized plasmons in proximal nanostructures is a\nwell-studied phenomenon. Here we explore plasmon plasmon interactions in\nconnected extended systems. Such systems can now be easily produced using\ngraphene. Specifically we employ the finite element method to study such\ninteractions in graphene nanoribbon arrays with a periodically modulated\nelectrochemical potential or number of layers. We find a rich variation in the\nresulting plasmonic resonances depending on the dimensions and the\nelectrochemical potentials (doping) of the nanoribbon segments and the\ninvolvement of transverse and longitudinal plasmon interactions. Unlike\npredictions based of the well-known \"orbital hybridization model\", the energies\nof the resulting hybrid plasmonic resonances of the extended system can lie\nbetween the energies of the plasmons of the individual components. The results\ndemonstrate the wide range tunability of the graphene plasmons and can help to\ndesign structures with desired spectra, which can be used to enhance optical\nfields in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n", "  Dynamical phase separation during a solid-solid phase transition poses a\nchallenge for understanding the fundamental processes in correlated materials.\nCritical information underlying a phase transition, such as localized phase\ncompetition, is difficult to reveal by measurements that are spatially averaged\nover many phase separated regions. The ability to simultaneously track the\nspatial and temporal evolution of such systems is essential to understanding\nmesoscopic processes during a phase transition. Using state-of-the-art\ntime-resolved hard x-ray diffraction microscopy, we directly visualize the\nstructural phase progression in a VO2 film upon photoexcitation. Following a\nhomogenous in-plane optical excitation, the phase transformation is initiated\nat discrete sites and completed by the growth of one lattice structure into the\nother, instead of a simultaneous isotropic lattice symmetry change. The\ntime-dependent x-ray diffraction spatial maps show that the in-plane phase\nprogression in laser-superheated VO2 is via a displacive lattice transformation\nas a result of relaxation from an excited monoclinic phase into a rutile phase.\nThe speed of the phase front progression is quantitatively measured, and is\nfaster than the process driven by in-plane thermal diffusion but slower than\nthe sound speed in VO2. The direct visualization of localized structural\nchanges in the time domain opens a new avenue to study mesoscopic processes in\ndriven systems.\n", "  We study the dynamics of photonic quantum circuits consisting of nodes\ncoupled by quantum channels. We are interested in the regime where time delay\nin communication between the nodes is significant. This includes the problem of\nquantum feedback, where a quantum signal is fed back on a system with a time\ndelay. We develop a matrix product state approach to solve the Quantum\nStochastic Schr\\\"odinger Equation with time delays, which accounts in an\nefficient way for the entanglement of nodes with the stream of emitted photons\nin the waveguide, and thus the non-Markovian character of the dynamics. We\nillustrate this approach with two paradigmatic quantum optical examples: two\ncoherently driven distant atoms coupled to a photonic waveguide with a time\ndelay, and a driven atom coupled to its own output field with a time delay as\nan instance of a quantum feedback problem.\n", "  Real-time feedback from iterative electronic structure calculations requires\nto mediate between the inherently unpredictable execution times of the\niterative algorithm employed and the necessity to provide data in fixed and\nshort time intervals for real-time rendering. We introduce the concept of a\nmediator as a component able to deal with infrequent and unpredictable\nreference data to generate reliable feedback. In the context of real-time\nquantum chemistry, the mediator takes the form of a surrogate potential that\nhas the same local shape as the first-principles potential and can be evaluated\nefficiently to deliver atomic forces as real-time feedback. The surrogate\npotential is updated continuously by electronic structure calculations and\nguarantees to provide a reliable response to the operator for any molecular\nstructure. To demonstrate the application of iterative electronic structure\nmethods in real-time reactivity exploration, we implement self-consistent\nsemi-empirical methods as the data source and apply the surrogate-potential\nmediator to deliver reliable real-time feedback.\n", "  Here we present a commentary on the role of small-scale (e.g., few tens of\nmeters) wave-particle interactions in large-scale (e.g., few tens of\nkilometers) processes and their capacity to accelerate particles from thermal\nto suprathermal or even to cosmic-ray energies. The purpose of this commentary\nis to provoke thought and further investigation into the relative importance of\nelectromagnetic waves in the global dynamics of many macroscopic systems. We\nspecifically focus on the terrestrial radiation belts and collisionless shock\nwaves as examples.\n", "  Theories with higher order time derivatives generically suffer from\nghost-like instabilities, known as Ostrogradski instabilities. This fate can be\navoided by considering \"degenerate\" Lagrangians, whose kinetic matrix cannot be\ninverted, thus leading to constraints between canonical variables and a reduced\nnumber of physical degrees of freedom. In this work, we derive in a systematic\nway the degeneracy conditions for scalar-tensor theories that depend\nquadratically on second order derivatives of a scalar field. We thus obtain a\nclassification of all degenerate theories within this class of scalar-tensor\ntheories. The quartic Horndeski Lagrangian and its extension beyond Horndeski\nbelong to these degenerate cases. We also identify new families of\nscalar-tensor theories with the intriguing property that they are degenerate\ndespite the nondegeneracy of the purely scalar part of their Lagrangian.\n", "  In this study we give a characterization of semi-geostrophic turbulence by\nperforming freely decaying simulations for the case of constant uniform\npotential vorticity, a set of equations known as surface semi-geostrophic\napproximation. The equations are formulated as conservation laws for potential\ntemperature and potential vorticity, with a nonlinear Monge-Amp\\'{e}re type\ninversion equation for the streamfunction, expressed in a transformed\ncoordinate system that follows the geostrophic flow. We perform model studies\nof turbulent surface semi-geostrophic flows in a doubly-periodic domain in the\nhorizontal limited in the vertical by two rigid lids, allowing for variations\nof potential temperature at one of the boundaries, and we compare them with the\ncorresponding surface quasi-geostrophic case. Results show that, while surface\nquasi-geostrophic dynamics is dominated by a symmetric population of\ncyclones-anticyclones, surface semi-geostrophic dynamics features a more\nprominent role of fronts and filaments. The resulting distribution of potential\ntemperature is strongly skewed and peaked at non-zero values at and close to\nthe active boundary, while symmetry is restored in the interior of the domain,\nwhere small-scale frontal structures do not penetrate. In surface\nsemi-geostrophic turbulence energy spectra are less steep than in the surface\nquasi-geostrophic case, with more energy concentrated at small scales for\nincreasing Rossby number. Energy connected to frontal structures, lateral\nstrain rate and vertical velocities are largest close to the active boundary.\nThese results show that the semi-geostrophic model could be of interest for\nstudying the lateral mixing of properties in geophysical flows.\n", "  In this paper we demonstrate how, using the coset construction, a theory can\nbe systematically made Weyl invariant by gauging the scale symmetry. We show\nthat an analog of the inverse Higgs constraint allows the elimination of the\nWeyl vector (gauge) field in favor of curvatures. We extend the procedure --\npreviously coined Ricci gauging -- and discuss its subtlety for the case of\ntheories with higher derivatives of conformally variant fields.\n", "  The description of wind phenomena is frequently based on data obtained from\nanemometers, which usually report the wind speed and direction only in a\nhorizontal plane. Such measurements are commonly used either to develop wind\ngeneration farms or to forecast weather conditions in a geographical region.\nBeyond these standard applications, the information contained in the data may\nbe richer than expected and may lead to a better understanding of the wind\ndynamics in a geographical area. In this work we propose a statistical analysis\nbased on the wind velocity vectors, which we propose may be grouped in \"wind\nstates\" associated to binormal distribution functions. We found that the\nvelocity plane defined by the anemometric velocity data may be used as a phase\nspace, where a finite number of states may be found and sorted using standard\nclustering methods. The main result is a discretization technique useful to\nmodel the wind with Markov chains. We applied such ideas in anemometric data\nfor two different sites in Mexico where the wind resource is considered\nreliable. The approximated Markov chains of both places give a set of values\nfor transition probabilities and residence times that may be regarded as a\nsignature of the dynamics of the site. We consider the results may impact\neither the technical decisions for the design of wind generators or the\ndetailed resource assessment in sites with non-standard features.\n", "  When exposed to intense electromagnetic fields, the quantum vacuum is\nexpected to exhibit properties of a polarisable medium akin to a weakly\nnonlinear dielectric material. Various schemes have been proposed to measure\nsuch vacuum polarisation effects using a combination of high power lasers.\nMotivated by several planned experiments, we provide an overview of\nexperimental signatures that have been suggested to confirm this prediction of\nquantum electrodynamics of real photon-photon scattering.\n", "  We calculate reduced $B(E2)$ electromagnetic transition strengths for light\nnuclei of mass numbers $B=8,12,16,20,24$ and $32$ within the Skyrme model. We\nfind that the predicted transition strengths are of the correct order of\nmagnitude and the computed intrinsic quadrupole moments match the\nexperimentally observed effective nuclear shapes. For the Hoyle state we\npredict a large $B(E2)\\!\\uparrow$ value of $0.0521\\, \\rm{e}^2\\rm{b}^2$. For\nOxygen-16, we can obtain a quantitative understanding of the ground state\nrotational band and the rotational excitations of the second spin-0 state,\n$0_2^+$.\n", "  Motivated by exploring the effect of interactions on Chern insulators, and by\nrecent experiments realizing topological bands for ultracold atoms in synthetic\ngauge fields, we study the honeycomb lattice Haldane-Hubbard model of\nspin-$1/2$ fermions. Using an unrestricted mean field approach, we map out the\ninstability of the topological band insulator towards magnetically ordered\ninsulators which emerge with increasing Hubbard repulsion. In addition to the\ntopological N\\'eel phase, we recover various chiral noncoplanar magnetic orders\npreviously identified within a strong coupling approach. We compute the band\nstructure of these ordered phases, showing that the triple-$Q$ tetrahedral\nphase harbors topological Chern bands with large Chern numbers.\n", "  Ridged, orthorhombic two-dimensional atomic crystals with a bulk {\\em Pnma}\nstructure such as black phosphorus and monochalcogenide monolayers are an\nexciting and novel material platform for a host of applications. Key to their\ncrystallinity, monolayers of these materials have a four-fold degenerate\nstructural ground state, and a single energy scale $E_C$ (representing the\nelastic energy required to switch the longer lattice vector along the $x-$ or\n$y-$direction) determines how disordered these monolayers are at finite\ntemperature. Disorder arises when nearest neighboring atoms become gently\nreassigned as the system is thermally excited beyond a critical temperature\n$T_c$ that is proportional to $E_C/k_B$. $E_C$ is tunable by chemical\ncomposition and it leads to a classification of these materials into two\ncategories: (i) Those for which $E_C\\ge k_BT_m$, and (ii) those having\n$k_BT_m>E_C\\ge 0$, where $T_m$ is a given material's melting temperature. Black\nphosphorus and SiS monolayers belong to category (i): these materials do not\ndisplay an intermediate order-disorder transition and melt directly. All other\nmonochalcogenide monolayers with $E_C>0$ belonging to class (ii) will undergo a\ntwo-dimensional transition prior to melting. $E_C/k_B$ is slightly larger than\nroom temperature for GeS and GeSe, and smaller than 300 K for SnS and SnSe\nmonolayers, so that these materials transition near room temperature. The onset\nof this generic atomistic phenomena is captured by a planar Potts model up to\nthe order-disorder transition. The order-disorder phase transition in two\ndimensions described here is at the origin of the {\\em Cmcm} phase being\ndiscussed within the context of bulk layered SnSe.\n", "  Many giant exoplanets in close orbits have observed radii which exceed\ntheoretical predictions. One suggested explanation for this discrepancy is heat\ndeposited deep inside the atmospheres of these \"hot Jupiters\". Here, we study\nextended power sources which distribute heat from the photosphere to the deep\ninterior of the planet. Our analytical treatment is a generalization of a\nprevious analysis of localized \"point sources\". We model the deposition profile\nas a power law in the optical depth and find that planetary cooling and\ncontraction halt when the internal luminosity (i.e. cooling rate) of the planet\ndrops below the heat deposited in the planet's convective region. A slowdown in\nthe evolutionary cooling prior to equilibrium is possible only for sources\nwhich do not extend to the planet's center. We estimate the Ohmic dissipation\nresulting from the interaction between the atmospheric winds and the planet's\nmagnetic field, and apply our analytical model to Ohmically heated planets. Our\nmodel can account for the observed radii of most inflated planets which have\nequilibrium temperatures $\\approx 1500\\textrm{K}-2500\\textrm{K}$, and are\ninflated to a radius $\\approx 1.6 R_J$. However, some extremely inflated\nplanets remain unexplained by our model. We also argue that Ohmically inflated\nplanets have already reached their equilibrium phase, and no longer contract.\nFollowing Wu & Lithwick who argued that Ohmic heating could only suspend and\nnot reverse contraction, we calculate the time it takes Ohmic heating to\nre-inflate a cold planet to its equilibrium configuration. We find that while\nit is possible to re-inflate a cold planet, the re-inflation timescales are\nlonger by a factor of $\\approx 30$ than the cooling time.\n", "  Topological superconductors host new states of quantum matter which show a\npairing gap in the bulk and gapless surface states providing a platform to\nrealize Majorana fermions. Recently, alkaline-earth metal Sr intercalated\nBi2Se3 has been reported to show superconductivity with a Tc ~ 3 K and a large\nshielding fraction. Here we report systematic normal state electronic structure\nstudies of Sr0.06Bi2Se3 (Tc ~ 2.5 K) by performing photoemission spectroscopy.\nUsing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we observe a quantum\nwell confined two-dimensional (2D) state coexisting with a topological surface\nstate in Sr0.06Bi2Se3. Furthermore, our time-resolved ARPES reveals the\nrelaxation dynamics showing different decay mechanism between the excited\ntopological surface states and the two-dimensional states. Our experimental\nobservation is understood by considering the intra-band scattering for\ntopological surface states and an additional electron phonon scattering for the\n2D states, which is responsible for the superconductivity. Our first-principles\ncalculations agree with the more effective scattering and a shorter lifetime of\nthe 2D states. Our results will be helpful in understanding low temperature\nsuperconducting states of these topological materials.\n", "  Many experiments exploring weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) such\nas direct, indirect and collider searches have been carried out until now.\nHowever, a clear signal of a WIMP has not been found yet and it makes us to\nsuspect that WIMPs are questionable as a dark matter candidate. Taking into\naccount this situation, we propose two models in which dark matter relic\ndensity is produced by decay of a metastable particle. In the first model, the\nmetastable particle is a feebly interacting massive particle, which is the\nso-called FIMP produced by freeze-in mechanism in the early universe. In the\nsecond model, the decaying particle is thermally produced the same as the usual\nWIMP. However decay of the particle into dark matter is led by a higher\ndimensional operator. As a phenomenologically interesting feature of nonthermal\ndark matter discussed in this paper, a strong sharp gamma-ray emission as an\nindirect detection signal occurs due to internal bremsstrahlung, although some\nparameter space has already been ruled out by this process. Moreover combining\nother experimental and theoretical constraints such as dark matter relic\ndensity, big bang nucleosynthesis, collider, gamma-rays and perturbativity of\ncouplings, we discuss the two nonthermal DM models.\n", "  We study the impact on the Sun of an exotic energy-loss channel caused by\nplasmon decay into fermionic minicharged particles with charge $\\epsilon e$ and\nmass $m_f$. We compare solar models with this extra emission to\nhelioseismological and neutrino data, obtaining a bound $\\epsilon <2.2\\times\n10^{-14}\\ ({\\rm 95\\%\\, CL})$ for $m_f\\lesssim 25 \\, \\text{eV}$. Our result is\ncomparable to previous limits from the cooling of globular cluster stars, while\nat the same time it is better understood and takes theoretical and\nobservational errors into account.\n", "  Light beams can carry a discrete, in principle unbounded amount of angular\nmomentum. Examples of such beams, the Laguerre-Gauss modes, are frequently\nexpressed as solutions of the paraxial wave equation. There, they are\neigenstates of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) operator. The paraxial\nsolutions predict that beams with large OAM could be used to resolve\narbitrarily small distances - a dubious situation. Here we show how to solve\nthat situation by calculating the properties of beams free from the paraxial\napproximation. We find the surprising result that indeed one can resolve\nsmaller distances with larger OAM, although with decreased visibility. If the\nvisibility is kept constant (for instance at the Rayleigh criterion, the limit\nwhere two points are reasonably distinguishable), larger OAM does not provide\nan advantage. The drop in visibility is due to a field in the direction of\npropagation, which is neglected within the paraxial limit.\n", "  We show that, contrary to simple predictions, most AGNs show at best only a\nsmall increase of lags in the J, H, K, and L bands with increasing wavelength.\nWe suggest that a possible cause of this near simultaneity of the variability\nfrom the near-IR to the mid-IR is that the hot dust is in a hollow bi-conical\noutflow of which we only see the near side. Although most AGNs show near\nsimultaneity of IR variability, there was at least one epoch when NGC 4151\nshowed the sharply increasing IR lag with the increase of the wavelength. This\nbehaviour might also be present in GQ Comae. We discuss these results briefly.\nThe relative wavelength independence of IR lags simplifies the use of IR lags\nfor estimating cosmological parameters.\n", "  Weyl semimetals may open a new era in condensed matter physics, materials\nscience and nanotech after graphene and topological insulators. We report the\nfirst atomic scale view of the surface states of a Weyl semimetal (NbP) using\nscanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. We observe coherent quantum\ninterference patterns that arise from the scattering of quasiparticles near\npoint defects on the surface. The measurements reveal the surface electronic\nstructure both below and above the chemical potential in both real and\nreciprocal spaces. Moreover, the interference maps uncover the scattering\nprocesses of NbP's exotic surface states. Through comparison between\nexperimental data and theoretical calculations, we further discover that the\nscattering channels are largely restricted by the orbital and/or spin texture\nof the surface band. The visualization of the scattering processes can help\ndesign novel transport effects and electronics on the topological surface of a\nWeyl semimetal.\n", "  We study electron transport at the edge of a generic disordered\ntwo-dimensional topological insulator, where some channels are topologically\nprotected from backscattering. Assuming the total number of channels is large,\nwe consider the edge as a quasi-one-dimensional quantum wire and describe it in\nterms of a non-linear sigma model with a topological term. Neglecting\nlocalization effects, we calculate the average distribution function of\ntransmission probabilities as a function of the sample length. We mainly focus\non the two experimentally relevant cases: a junction between two quantum Hall\n(QH) states with different filling factors (unitary class) and a relatively\nthick quantum well exhibiting quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect (symplectic\nclass). In a QH sample, the presence of topologically protected modes leads to\na strong suppression of diffusion in the other channels already at the scales\nmuch shorter than the localization length. On the semiclassical level, this is\naccompanied by the formation of a gap in the spectrum of transmission\nprobabilities close to unit transmission, thereby suppressing shot noise and\nconductance fluctuations. In the case of a QSH system, there is at most one\ntopologically protected edge channel leading to weaker transport effects. In\norder to describe `topological' suppression of nearly perfect transparencies,\nwe develop an exact mapping of the semiclassical limit of the one-dimensional\nsigma model onto a zero-dimensional sigma model of a different symmetry class,\nallowing us to identify the distribution of transmission probabilities with the\naverage spectral density of a certain random-matrix ensemble. We extend our\nresults to other symmetry classes with topologically protected edges in two\ndimensions.\n", "  In a recent work by two of us, we have studied, how CP violation discovery\npotential can be improved at long baseline neutrino experiments (LBNE/DUNE), by\ncombining with its ND (near detector) and reactor experiments. In this work, we\ndiscuss how this study can be further analyzed to resolve entanglement of the\nquadrant of leptonic CPV phase and Octant of atmospheric mixing angle\n$\\theta_{23}$, at LBNEs. The study is done for both NH (Normal hierarchy) and\nIH (Inverted hierarchy), HO (Higher Octant) and LO (Lower Octant). We show how\nleptogenesis can enhance the effect of resolving this entanglement, and how\npossible values of the leptonic CPV phase can be predicted in this context.\nCarrying out numerical analysis based on the recent updated experimental\nresults for neutrino mixing angles, we predict the values of the leptonic CPV\nphase for 152 possible cases. We also confront our predictions of the leptonic\nCPV phase with the updated global fit and find that five values of\n$\\delta_{CP}$ are favoured by BAU constraints. One of the five values matches\nwith the recent global fit value of $\\delta_{CP}$ (leptonic CPV phase) close to\n1.41 $\\pi$ in our model independent scenario. A detailed analytic and numerical\nstudy of baryogenesis through leptogenesis is performed in this framework in a\nmodel independent way.\n", "  We discuss the detectability of large-scale HI intensity fluctuations using\nthe FAST telescope. We present forecasts for the accuracy of measuring the\nBaryonic Acoustic Oscillations and constraining the properties of dark energy.\nThe FAST $19$-beam L-band receivers ($1.05$--$1.45$ GHz) can provide\nconstraints on the matter power spectrum and dark energy equation of state\nparameters ($w_{0},w_{a}$) that are comparable to the BINGO and CHIME\nexperiments. For one year of integration time we find that the optimal survey\narea is $6000\\,{\\rm deg}^2$. However, observing with larger frequency coverage\nat higher redshift ($0.95$--$1.35$ GHz) improves the projected errorbars on the\nHI power spectrum by more than $2~\\sigma$ confidence level. The combined\nconstraints from FAST, CHIME, BINGO and Planck CMB observations can provide\nreliable, stringent constraints on the dark energy equation of state.\n", "  We address the impact of sterile fermions on charged lepton electric dipole\nmoments. Any experimental signal of these observables calls for scenarios of\nphysics beyond the Standard Model providing new sources of CP violation. In\nthis work, we consider a minimal extension of the Standard Model via the\naddition of sterile fermions which mix with active neutrinos and we derive the\ncorresponding analytical expressions for the electric dipole moments of charged\nleptons at two-loop order. Our study reveals that, in order to have a\nnon-vanishing contribution in this framework, the minimal extension\nnecessitates the addition of at least 2 sterile fermion states to the Standard\nModel field content. Our conclusion is that sterile neutrinos can give\nsignificant contributions to the charged lepton electric dipole moments, some\nof them lying within present and future experimental sensitivity if the masses\nof the non-degenerate sterile states are both above the electroweak scale. The\nMajorana nature of neutrinos is also important in order to allow for\nsignificative contributions to the charged lepton electric dipole moments. In\nour analysis we impose all available experimental and observational constraints\non sterile neutrinos and we further discuss the prospect of probing this\nscenario at low and high energy experiments.\n", "  Inspired by the recent measurements on the $J/{\\psi}(1S)$ ${\\to}$\n$D_{s}{\\rho}$, $D_{u}K^{\\ast}$ weak decays at BESIII and the potential\nprospects of the charmonium at the high-luminosity heavy-flavor experiments, we\nstudy ${\\psi}(1S,2S)$ and ${\\eta}_{c}(1S,2S)$ weak decays into final states\nincluding one charmed meson plus one light meson, considering the QCD\ncorrections to hadronic matrix elements with the QCD factorization. It is found\nthat the Cabibbo favored ${\\psi}(1S,2S)$ ${\\to}$ $D_{s}^{-}{\\rho}^{+}$,\n$D_{s}^{-}{\\pi}^{+}$, $\\overline{D}_{u}^{0}\\overline{K}^{{\\ast}0}$ decays have\nbranching ratios ${\\gtrsim}$ $10^{-10}$, which might be accessible at the\nfuture experiments.\n", "  Quantum entanglement of identical particles is essential in quantum\ninformation theory. Yet, its correct determination remains an open issue\nhindering the general understanding and exploitation of many-particle systems.\nOperator-based methods have been developed that attempt to overcome the issue.\nWe introduce a state-based method which, as second quantization, does not label\nidentical particles and presents conceptual and technical advances compared to\nthe previous ones. It establishes the quantitative role played by arbitrary\nwave function overlaps, local measurements and particle nature (bosons or\nfermions) in assessing entanglement by notions commonly used in quantum\ninformation theory for distinguishable particles, like partial trace. Our\napproach furthermore shows that bringing identical particles into the same\nspatial location functions as an entangling gate, providing fundamental\ntheoretical support to recent experimental observations with ultracold atoms.\nThese results pave the way to set and interpret experiments for utilizing\nquantum correlations in realistic scenarios where overlap of particles can\ncount, as in Bose-Einstein condensates, quantum dots and biological molecular\naggregates.\n", "  Quantum light-matter interfaces are at the heart of photonic quantum\ntechnologies. Quantum memories for photons, where non-classical states of\nphotons are mapped onto stationary matter states and preserved for subsequent\nretrieval, are technical realizations enabled by exquisite control over\ninteractions between light and matter. The ability of quantum memories to\nsynchronize probabilistic events makes them a key component in quantum\nrepeaters and quantum computation based on linear optics. This critical feature\nhas motivated many groups to dedicate theoretical and experimental research to\ndevelop quantum memory devices. In recent years, exciting new applications, and\nmore advanced developments of quantum memories, have proliferated. In this\nreview, we outline some of the emerging applications of quantum memories in\noptical signal processing, quantum computation, and nonlinear optics. We review\nrecent experimental and theoretical developments, and their impacts on more\nadvanced photonic quantum technologies based on quantum memories.\n", "  We discover and characterize strong quantum scars, or eigenstates resembling\nclassical periodic orbits, in two-dimensional quantum wells perturbed by local\nimpurities. These scars are not explained by ordinary scar theory, which would\nrequire the existence of short, moderately unstable periodic orbits in the\nperturbed system. Instead, they are supported by classical resonances in the\nunperturbed system and the resulting quantum near-degeneracy. Even in the case\nof a large number of randomly scattered impurities, the scars prefer distinct\norientations that extremize the overlap with the impurities. We demonstrate\nthat these preferred orientations can be used for highly efficient transport of\nquantum wave packets across the perturbed potential landscape. Assisted by the\nscars, wave-packet recurrences are significantly stronger than in the\nunperturbed system. Together with the controllability of the preferred\norientations, this property may be very useful for quantum transport\napplications.\n", "  The model and algorithm for the cooling of the magnetized neutron stars are\npresented. The cooling evolution described by system of parabolic partial\ndifferential equations with non-linear coefficients is solved using Alternating\nDirection Implicit method. The difference scheme and the preliminary results of\nsimulations are presented.\n", "  We propose that three recent anomalies in $B$ meson decays, $R_{D^{(*)}}$,\n$R_K$, and $P_5'$, might be explained by a single vector leptoquark weak\ntriplet state. The constraints on the parameter space are obtained by\nconsidering $t \\to b \\tau^+ \\nu$ data, lepton flavor universality tests in the\nkaon sector, bounds on $B \\to K^{(*)} \\bar \\nu \\nu$, bound on the lepton flavor\nviolating decay $B \\to K \\mu \\tau$, and measurements of $b \\to c \\mu^- \\bar\\nu$\ndecays. The presence of such vector leptoquark could be exposed in precise\nmeasurements of $t \\to b \\tau \\nu$ and $B \\to K^{(*)} \\bar \\nu \\nu$ decays. The\nmodel also predicts approximate equality of lepton flavor universality ratios\n$R_{K^*}$, $R_{K}$, and suppressed branching fraction of $B_s \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-$.\n", "  The work describes the maximization problem regarding heating of an area on\nthe surface of a thin plate within a given temperature range. The solution of\nthe problem is applied to ion injectors. The given temperature range\ncorresponds to a required pressure of a saturated gas comprising evaporated\natoms of the plate material. In order to find the solution, a one-parameter\noptimization problem was formulated and implemented leading to optimization of\nthe plate's specific geometry. It was shown that a heated area can be increased\nup to 23.5% in comparison with the regular rectangle form of a given plate\nconfiguration.\n", "  The single-mode Rayleigh-Taylor instability (smRTI) is well defined, poorly\nunderstood, and applicable to many fluid flows directly and through its\nrelationship to multi-mode Rayleigh-Taylor models. This study reproduces three\nlow-Atwood smRTI experimental runs (Wilkinson and Jacobs, 2007) in a\nspecialized version of the Nek5000 spectral element code. The simulations use\nthe initial amplitude, wavelength, acceleration, Atwood number, and viscosity\nfrom the three specific experiments and impose no-slip and no-flux boundaries\non the velocity and scalar, respectively. The simulations are shown to\nreproduce the linear, saturation, stagnation, and re-acceleration phases of the\nsmRTI seen in the experiments. Additionally, access to the full velocity and\nscalar fields demonstrates three different finite size effects: wall drag, wall\nlift, and a long wavelength mode along the diagonal. One of the simulations is\nextended by a factor of two in the vertical direction and the resulting\nlate-time dynamics reach Froude numbers around 1.8, higher than previously\nreported. Finally, inspection of the span-wise flow reveals secondary flows of\nthe first kind that transport the scalar from the bubble-spike interfaces into\nthe bubble and spike centers. The agreement between simulations and experiments\ninspires confidence in the spectral element method for studying the\nRayleigh-Taylor instability.\n", "  One of the promising platforms for creating Majorana bound states is a hybrid\nnanostructure consisting of a semiconducting nanowire covered by a\nsuperconductor. We analyze the previously disregarded role of electrostatic\ninteraction in these devices. Our main result is that Coulomb interaction\ncauses the chemical potential to respond to an applied magnetic field, while\nspin-orbit interaction and screening by the superconducting lead suppress this\nresponse. Consequently, the electrostatic environment influences two properties\nof Majorana devices: the shape of the topological phase boundary and the\noscillations of the Majorana splitting energy. We demonstrate that both\nproperties show a non-universal behavior, and depend on the details of the\nelectrostatic environment. We show that when the wire only contains a single\nelectron mode, the experimentally accessible inverse self-capacitance of this\nmode fully captures the interplay between electrostatics and Zeeman field. This\noffers a way to compare theoretical predictions with experiments.\n", "  All quintessence potentials that are either monotonic with negative interval\nor have a minimum at negative values of the potential, generically predict a\nfuture collapse of the scale factor to a \"doomsday\" singularity. We show that\nthis doomsday is generically avoided in models with a proper non-minimal\ncoupling of the quintessence scalar field to the curvature scalar $R$. For\nsimplicity we consider linear quintessence potential $V=-s\\phi$ and linear\nnon-minimal coupling $F=1-\\lambda \\phi$. However our result is generic and is\ndue to the fact that the non-minimal coupling modifies the effective potential\nthat determines the dynamics of the scalar field. Thus for each positive value\nof the parameter $s$ we find a critical value $\\lambda_{crit}(s)$ such that for\n$\\lambda>\\lambda_{crit}(s)$ the negative potential energy does not dominate the\nuniverse and the cosmic doomsday Big Crunch singularity is avoided because the\nscalar field eventually rolls up its potential. We find that\n$\\lambda_{crit}(s)$ increases approximately linearly with $s$. For\n$\\lambda>\\lambda_{crit}(s)$ the potential energy of the scalar field becomes\npositive and it eventually dominates while the dark energy equation of state\nparameter tends to $w=-1$ leading to a deSitter Universe.\n", "  Despite considerable interest in layered transition metal dichalcogenides\n(TMDs), such as MX2 with M = (Mo, W) and X = (S, Se, Te), the physical origin\nof their topological nature is still poorly understood. In the conventional\nview of topological phase transition (TPT), the non-trivial topology of\nelectron bands in TMDs is caused by the band inversion between metal d and\nchalcogen p orbital bands, where the former is pulled down below the latter.\nHere, we show that, in TMDs, the TPT is entirely different from the\nconventional speculation. In particular, MS2 and MSe2 exhibits the opposite\nbehavior of TPT, such that the chalcogen p orbital band moves down below the\nmetal d orbital band. More interestingly, in MTe2, the band inversion occurs\nbetween the metal d orbital bands. Our findings cast doubts on the common view\nof TPT and provide clear guidelines for understanding the topological nature in\nnew topological materials to be discovered.\n", "  The $\\Lambda(1405)$ resonance production reaction is investigated within the\nframework of the coupled-channels Alt-Grassberger-Sandhas (AGS) equations. We\nperform full three-body calculations for the $\\bar{K}NN-\\pi YN$ amplitudes on\nthe physical real energy axis and investigate how the signature of the\n$\\Lambda(1405)$ appears in the cross sections of the $K^-d\\rightarrow \\pi\\Sigma\nn$ reactions, also in view of the planned E31 experiment at J-PARC. Two types\nof meson-baryon interaction models are considered: an energy-dependent\ninteraction based on chiral $SU(3)$ effective field theory, and an\nenergy-independent version that has been used repeatedly in phenomenological\napproaches. These two models have different off-shell properties that imply\ncorrespondingly different behavior in the three-body system. We investigate how\nthese features show up in differential cross sections of $K^- d\\rightarrow\n\\pi\\Sigma n$ reactions. Characteristic patterns distinguishing between the two\nmodels are found in the invariant mass spectrum of the final $\\pi\\Sigma$ state.\nThe $K^-d\\rightarrow \\pi\\Sigma n$ reaction, with different\n($\\pi^{\\pm}\\Sigma^{\\mp}$ and $\\pi^{0}\\Sigma^{0}$) charge combinations in the\nfinal state, is thus demonstrated to be a useful tool for investigating the\nsubthreshold behavior of the $\\bar{K}N$ interaction.\n", "  We present a supersymmetric left-right model which predicts gauge coupling\nunification close to the string scale and extra vector bosons at the TeV scale.\nThe subtleties in constructing a model which is in agreement with the measured\nquark masses and mixing for such a low left-right breaking scale are discussed.\nIt is shown that in the constrained version of this model radiative breaking of\nthe gauge symmetries is possible and a SM-like Higgs is obtained. Additional\nCP-even scalars of a similar mass or even much lighter are possible. The\nexpected mass hierarchies for the supersymmetric states differ clearly from\nthose of the constrained MSSM. In particular, the lightest down-type squark,\nwhich is a mixture of the sbottom and extra vector-like states, is always\nlighter than the stop. We also comment on the model's capability to explain\ncurrent anomalies observed at the LHC.\n", "  Photographic emulsion is a particle tracking device which features the best\nspatial resolution among particle detectors. For certain applications, for\nexample muon radiography, large-scale detectors are required. Therefore, a huge\nsurface has to be analyzed by means of automated optical microscopes. An\nimprovement of the readout speed is then a crucial point to make these\napplications possible and the availability of a new type of photographic\nemulsions featuring crystals of larger size is a way to pursue this program.\nThis would allow a lower magnification for the microscopes, a consequent larger\nfield of view resulting in a faster data analysis. In this framework, we\ndeveloped new kinds of emulsion detectors with a crystal size of 600-1000 nm,\nnamely 3-5 times larger than conventional ones, allowing a 25 times faster data\nreadout. The new photographic emulsions have shown a sufficient sensitivity and\na good signal to noise ratio. The proposed development opens the way to future\nlarge-scale applications of the technology, e.g. 3D imaging of glacier bedrocks\nor future neutrino experiments.\n", "  Pulay's Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace (DIIS) method is one of\nthe most widely used mixing schemes for accelerating the self-consistent\nsolution of electronic structure problems. In this work, we propose a simple\ngeneralization of DIIS in which Pulay extrapolation is performed at periodic\nintervals rather than on every self-consistent field iteration, and linear\nmixing is performed on all other iterations. We demonstrate through numerical\ntests on a wide variety of materials systems in the framework of density\nfunctional theory that the proposed generalization of Pulay's method\nsignificantly improves its robustness and efficiency.\n", "  We investigate the double Higgs production and decay at the $14~ {\\rm TeV}$\nLHC and $33~ {\\rm TeV}$ HE-LHC in both the standard model and Randall-Sundrum\n(RS) model. In our calculation we consider reasonably only the contribution of\nthe lightest two Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons. We present the integrated cross\nsections and some kinematic distributions in both models. Our results show that\nthe RS effect in the vicinities of $M_{HH} \\sim M_{1}$, $M_{2}$ (the masses of\nthe lightest two KK gravitons) or in the central Higgs rapidity region is quite\nsignificant, and can be extracted from the heavy SM background by imposing\nproper kinematic cuts on final particles. We also study the dependence of the\ncross section on the RS model parameters, the first KK graviton mass $M_1$ and\nthe effective coupling $c_0$, and find that the RS effect is reduced obviously\nwith the increment of $M_1$ or decrement of $c_0$.\n", "  Within the framework of dispersion theory, we analyze the dipion transitions\nbetween the lightest $\\Upsilon$ states, $\\Upsilon(nS) \\rightarrow \\Upsilon(mS)\n\\pi\\pi$ with $m < n \\leq 3$. In particular, we consider the possible effects of\ntwo intermediate bottomoniumlike exotic states $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$.\nThe $\\pi\\pi$ rescattering effects are taken into account in a model-independent\nway using dispersion theory. We confirm that matching the dispersive\nrepresentation to the leading chiral amplitude alone cannot reproduce the\npeculiar two-peak $\\pi\\pi$ mass spectrum of the decay $\\Upsilon(3S) \\rightarrow\n\\Upsilon(1S) \\pi\\pi$. The existence of the bottomoniumlike $Z_b$ states can\nnaturally explain this anomaly. We also point out the necessity of a proper\nextraction of the coupling strengths for the $Z_b$ states to $\\Upsilon(nS)\\pi$,\nwhich is only possible if a Flatt\\'e-like parametrization is used in the data\nanalysis for the $Z_b$ states.\n", "  Embryogenesis, the process by which an organism forms and develops, has long\nbeen and still is a major field of investigation in the natural sciences. By\nwhich means, which forces, are embryonic cells and tissues assembled, deformed,\nand eventually organized into an animal? Because embryogenesis deeply questions\nour understanding of the mechanisms of life, it has motivated many scientific\ntheories and philosophies over the course of history. While genetics now seems\nto have emerged as a natural background to study embryogenesis, it was intuited\nlong ago that it should also rely on mechanical forces and on the physical\nproperties of cells and tissues. In the early 20th century, Stephane Leduc\nproposed that biology was merely a subset of fluid physics, and argued that\nbiology should focus on how forces act on living matter. Rejecting vitalism and\nlife-specific approaches, he designed naive experiments based on osmosis and\ndiffusion to mimic shapes and phenomena found in living systems, in order to\nidentify physical mechanisms that could support the development of the embryo.\nWhile Leduc's ideas then had some impact in the field, notably on later\nacclaimed D'Arcy Thompson, they fell into oblivion during the later 20th\ncentury. In this article I give an overview of Stephane Leduc's physical\napproach to life, and show that the paradigm that he introduced, although long\nforsaken, becomes more and more topical today, as developmental biology\nincreasingly turns to physics and self-organization theories to study the\nmechanisms of embryogenesis. His story, I suggest, bears witness to our\nreluctance to abandon life-specific approaches in biology.\n", "  We study the quantum Vavilov-Cherenkov (QVC) radiation and quantum friction\noccurring during motion of a small neutral particle parallel to a transparent\ndielectric plate with the refractive index $n$. This phenomenon occurs above\nthe threshold velocity $v_c=c/n$. The particle acceleration and rate of heating\nare determined by the friction force and heating power in the rest reference\nframe of the particle. We calculate these quantities starting from the\nexpressions for the friction force and the radiative energy transfer in the\nplate-plate configuration, assuming plate at the rest in the \\textit{lab} frame\nrarefied. Close to the light velocity there is a big difference between the\nfriction force and the radiation power in the rest frame of a particle and in\nthe \\textit{lab} reference frame. This difference is connected with the change\nof the rest mass of the particle due to absorption of radiation. Close to the\nthreshold velocity the decrease of the kinetic energy of the particle is\ndetermined mainly by radiation power in in the \\textit{lab} frame. However,\nclose to the light velocity it is determined also by the heating power for the\nparticle. We establish the connections between the quantities in the different\nreference frames. For a nanoparticle the QVC radiation intensity can be\ncomparable to classical one. We discuss the possibility to detect QVC\nradiation.\n", "  Magic state distillation is a critical component in leading proposals for\nfault-tolerant quantum computation. Relatively little is known, however, about\nhow to construct a magic state distillation routine or, more specifically,\nwhich stabilizer codes are suitable for the task. While transversality of a\nnon-Clifford gate within a code often leads to efficient distillation routines,\nit appears to not be a necessary condition. Here we have examined a number of\nsmall stabilizer codes and highlight a handful of which displaying interesting,\nalbeit inefficient, distillation behaviour. Many of these distill noisy states\nright up to the boundary of the known undististillable region, while some\ndistill toward non-stabilizer states that have not previously been considered.\n", "  We study hexagonal spin-channel (\"triplet\") density waves with commensurate\n$M$-point propagation vectors. We first show that the three $Q=M$ components of\nthe singlet charge density and charge-current density waves can be mapped to\nmulti-component $Q=0$ nonzero angular momentum order in three dimensions ($3D$)\nwith cubic crystal symmetry. This one-to-one correspondence is exploited to\ndefine a symmetry classification for triplet $M$-point density waves using the\nstandard classification of spin-orbit coupled electronic liquid crystal phases\nof a cubic crystal. Through this classification we naturally identify a set of\nnon-coplanar spin density and spin-current density waves: the chiral spin\ndensity wave and its time-reversal invariant analog. These can be thought of as\n$3D$ $L=2$ and $L=4$ spin-orbit coupled isotropic $\\beta$-phase orders. In\ncontrast, uniaxial spin density waves are shown to correspond to\n$\\alpha$-phases. The non-coplanar triple-$M$ spin-current density wave realizes\na novel $2D$ semimetal state with three flavors of four-component spin-momentum\nlocked Dirac cones, protected by a crystal symmetry akin to non-symmorphic\nsymmetry, and sits at the boundary between a trivial and topological insulator.\nIn addition, we point out that a special class of classical spin states,\ndefined as classical spin states respecting all lattice symmetries up to global\nspin rotation, are naturally obtained from the symmetry classification of\nelectronic triplet density waves. These symmetric classical spin states are the\nclassical long-range ordered limits of chiral spin liquids.\n", "  In this work we introduce a symmetry classification for electronic density\nwaves which break translational symmetry due to commensurate wave vector\nmodulations. The symmetry classification builds on the concept of extended\npoint groups: symmetry groups which contain, in addition to the lattice point\ngroup, translations that do not map the enlarged unit cell of the density wave\nto itself, and become \"non-symmorphic\"-like elements. Multi-dimensional\nrepresentations of the extended point group are associated with degenerate wave\nvectors. Electronic properties such as (nodal) band degeneracies and\ntopological character can be straightforwardly addressed, and often follow\ndirectly. To further flesh out the idea of symmetry, the classification is\nconstructed so as to manifestly distinguish time-reversal invariant charge\n(i.e., site and bond) order, and time-reversal breaking flux order. For the\npurpose of the present work we particularize to spin-rotation invariant density\nwaves. As a first example of the application of the classification we consider\nthe density waves of a simple single- and two-orbital square lattice model. The\nmain objective, however, is to apply the classification to two-dimensional\n($2D$) hexagonal lattices, specifically the triangular and the honeycomb\nlattices. The multi-component density waves corresponding to the commensurate\n$M$-point ordering vectors are worked out in detail. To show that our results\ngenerally apply to $2D$ hexagonal lattices, we develop a general low-energy\n$SU(3)$ theory of (spinless) saddle point electrons.\n", "  After the discovery of a Higgs boson in 2012 at the CERN Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) the detailed study of its properties, and most importantly its\ncouplings to other particles, has started. This is a very important task to be\ncompleted, in particular to test whether it is indeed the Higgs boson predicted\nby the Standard Model (SM). The precise study of the Higgs couplings to gauge\nbosons is of particular importance and requires as much information as\npossible. In this view this paper provides the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD\ncorrections to the production cross sections and differential distributions of\na SM Higgs boson in association with a pair of weak bosons $W^+W^-$, $W^\\pm Z$\nand $ZZ$, matched with parton shower (PS) in the POWHEG-BOX framework. The NLO\nQCD corrections are found to be significant and PS effects are sizable at low\n$p_T$ in the jet differential distributions, as expected, while these effects\nare negligible in other distributions. We will also provide a detailed study of\nthe theoretical uncertainties affecting the total production rates at the LHC\nand at the Future Circular Collider in hadron-hadron mode, the potential 100\nTeV follow-up of the LHC machine: the scale uncertainty calculated by the\nvariation of the renormalization and factorization scales, the parton\ndistribution function and related $\\alpha_s$ errors as well as the parametric\nuncertainties on the input weak boson masses.\n", "  We consider the possibility of interpreting the recently reported diphoton\nexcess at 750 GeV as a spin-two massive particle (such as a Kaluza-Klein\ngraviton in warped extra-dimensions) which serves as a mediator to Dark Matter\nvia its gravitational couplings to the dark sector and to the Standard Model\n(SM). We model non-universal couplings of the resonance to gauge bosons in the\nSM and to Dark Matter as a function on their localization in the extra\ndimension. We find that scalar, fermion or vector dark matter can saturate the\ndark matter relic density by the annihilation of dark matter into a pair of the\nSM particles or heavy resonances, in agreement with the diphoton resonance\nsignal strength. We check the compatibility of our hypothesis with other\nsearches for the KK graviton. We show that the invisible decay rate of the\nresonance into a pair of dark matter is subdominant in the region of the\ncorrect relic density, hence leading to no constraints from the mono-jet bound\nat 8 TeV via the gluon coupling. We also discuss the kinematic features of the\ndecay products of a KK graviton to distinguish the KK graviton from the SM\nbackgrounds or a scalar particle interpretation of the diphoton resonance.\n", "  We present a mainly analytical study of the entanglement spectrum of\nBernal-stacked graphene bilayers in the presence of trigonal warping in the\nenergy spectrum. Upon tracing out one layer, the entanglement spectrum shows\nqualitative geometric differences to the energy spectrum of a graphene\nmonolayer. However, topological quantities such as Berry phase type\ncontributions to Chern numbers agree. The latter analysis involves not only the\neigenvalues of the entanglement Hamiltonian but also its eigenvectors. We also\ndiscuss the entanglement spectra resulting from tracing out other sublattices.\nAs a technical basis of our analysis we provide closed analytical expressions\nfor the full eigensystem of bilayer graphene in the entire Brillouin zone with\na trigonally warped spectrum.\n", "  Cellular solids are a class of materials that have many interesting\nengineering applications, including ultralight structural materials. The\ntraditional method for analyzing these solids uses convex uniform polyhedral\nhoneycombs to represent the geometry of the material, and this approach has\ncarried over into the design of digital cellular solids. However, the use of\nsuch honeycomb-derived lattices makes the problem of decomposing a\nthree-dimensional lattice into a library of two-dimensional parts non-trivial.\nWe introduce a method for generating periodic frameworks from triply periodic\nminimal surfaces, which result in geometries that are easier to decompose into\ndigital parts. Additionally, we perform finite element modelling of two\ncellular solids generated from two TPMS, the P- and D-Schwarz, and two cellular\nsolids, the Kelvin and Octet honeycombs. We show that the simulated behavior of\nthese TMPS-derived structures shows the expected modulus of the cellular solid\nscaling linearly with relative density, which matches the behavior of the\nhighest-coordination honeycomb structure, the octet truss.\n", "  After reviewing the meaning of various equivalence principles and the\nstructure of electrodynamics, we give a fairly detailed account of the\nconstruction of the light cone and a core metric from the equivalence principle\nfor the photon (no birefringence, no polarization rotation and no\namplification/attenuation in propagation) in the framework of linear\nelectrodynamics using cosmic connections/observations as empirical support. The\ncosmic nonbirefringent propagation of photons independent of energy and\npolarization verifies the Galileo Equivalence Principle [Universality of\nPropagation] for photons/electromagnetic wave packets in spacetime. This\nnonbirefringence constrains the spacetime constitutive tensor to high precision\nto a core metric form with an axion degree and a dilaton degree of freedom.\nThus comes the metric with axion and dilation. Constraints on axion and dilaton\nfrom astrophysical/cosmic propagation are reviewed. E\\\"otv\\\"os-type\nexperiments, Hughes-Drever-type experiments, redshift experiments then\nconstrain and tie this core metric to agree with the matter metric, and hence a\nunique physical metric and universality of metrology. We summarize these\nexperiments and review how the Galileo equivalence principle constrains the\nEinstein Equivalence Principle (EEP) theoretically. In local physics this\nphysical metric gives the Lorentz/Poincar\\'e covariance. Understanding that the\nmetric and EEP come from the vacuum as a medium of electrodynamics in the\nlinear regime, efforts to actively look for potential effects beyond this\nlinear scheme are warranted.\n", "  The pheomenological Generalized Coherent State Model Hamiltonian is amended\nwith a many body term describing a set of nucleons moving in a shell model\nmean-field and interacting among themselves with paring, as well as with a\nparticle-core interaction involving a quadrupole-quadrupole and a\nhexadecapole-hexdecapole force and a spin-spin interaction. The model\nHamiltonian is treated in a restricted space consisting of the core projected\nstates associated to the bands ground, $\\beta, \\gamma,\\widetilde{\\gamma}, 1^+$\nand $\\widetilde{1^+}$ and two proton aligned quasiparticles coupled to the\nstates of the ground band. The chirally transformed particle-core states are\nalso included. The Hamiltonian contains two terms which are not invariant to\nthe chiral transformations relating the right handed trihedral $({\\bf J_F},\n{\\bf J_p}, {\\bf J_n})$ and the left handed ones $(-{\\bf J_F}, {\\bf J_p}, {\\bf\nJ_n})$, $({\\bf J_F}, -{\\bf J_p}, {\\bf J_n})$,\n  $({\\bf J_F}, {\\bf J_p}, -{\\bf J_n})$ where ${\\bf J_F}, {\\bf J_p}, {\\bf J_n}$\nare the angular momenta carried by fermions, proton and neutron bosons,\nrespectively. The energies defined with the particle-core states form four\nchiral bands, two of them being degenerate. Electromagnetic properties of the\nchiral bands are investigated. Results are compared with the experimental data\non $^{138}$Nd.\n", "  For calculation of the single-channel nucleon-nucleon scattering a\nphase-functions method has been considered. Using a phase-functions method the\nfollowing phase shifts of a nucleon-nucleon scattering are calculated\nnumerically: nn (1S0-, 3P0-, 3P1-, 1D2-, 3F3- state), pp (1S0-, 3P0-, 3P1-,\n1D2- state) and np (1S0-, 1P1-, 3P0-, 3P1-, 1D2-, 3D2- state). The calculations\nhas been performed using realistic nucleon-nucleon potentials Nijmegen groups\n(NijmI, NijmII, Reid93) and potential Argonne v18. Obtained phase shifts are in\ngood agreement with the results obtained in the framework of other methods.\nUsing the obtained phase shifts we have calculated the full cross-section. Our\nresults are in good agreement with those obtained by using known phases\npublished in literature. The odds between calculations depending on a\ncomputational method of phases of scattering makes: 0,2-6,3% for pp- and\n0,1-5,3% for np- scatterings (NijmI, NijmII), 0,1-4,1% for pp- and 0,1-0,4% for\nnp- scatterings (Reid93), no more than 4,5% (Argonne v18).\n", "  In this paper, we present the measurements of the [NII] 205micron line\n([NII]205) for a flux-limited sample of 122 (ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies\n[(U)LIRGs] and 20 additional normal galaxies, obtained with the Herschel Space\nObservatory. We explore the far-infrared (FIR) color dependence of the [NII]205\n(L[NII]205) to the total infrared (LIR) luminosity ratio, and find that\nL[NII]205/LIR only depends modestly on the 70-to-160 micron flux density ratio\n(f70/f160) when f70/f160 <~ 0.6, whereas such dependence becomes much steeper\nfor f70/f160> 0.6. We also investigate the relation between L[NII]205 and star\nformation rate (SFR), and show that L[NII]205 has a nearly linear correlation\nwith SFR, albeit the intercept of such relation varies somewhat with f60/f100,\nconsistent with our previous conclusion that \\NIIab\\ emission can serve as a\nSFR indicator with an accuracy of ~0.4 dex, or ~0.2 dex if f60/f100 is known\nindependently. Furthermore, together with the ISO measurements of [NII] 122\nmicron emission we use a total of ~200 galaxies to derive the local [NII]205\nluminosity function (LF) by tying it to the known IR LF with a bivariate\nmethod. As a practical application, we also compute the local SFR volume\ndensity ($\\dot{\\rho}_{\\rm SFR}$) using the newly derived SFR calibrator and LF.\nThe resulting $\\log\\,\\dot{\\rho}_{\\rm SFR} = -1.96\\pm0.11$\n$M_\\odot$\\,yr$^{-1}$\\,Mpc$^{-3}$ agrees well with previous studies. Finally, we\ndetermine the electron densities ($n_e$) of the ionized medium for a subsample\nof 12 (U)LIRGs with both [NII]205 and [NII]122 data, and find that $n_e$ is in\nthe range of ~1-100 cm$^{-3}$, with a median value of 22 cm$^{-3}$\n", "  We develop a general theory of spin-dependent Bragg spectroscopy for spinor\nBose-Einstein condensates. This spectroscopy involves using a density and\nspin-coupled optical probe to excite the system. We show that within the linear\nresponse regime the momentum or energy transferred by the probe is determined\nby a set of density and spin-density dynamic structure factors. We derive a set\nof $f$-sum rules that provide rigorous constraints for the first energy moments\nof these structure factors. As an application we compute the dynamic structure\nfactors for cases within all four distinct phases of a spin-1 condensate using\nBogoliubov theory. Our results demonstrate that spin-dependent Bragg\nspectroscopy can be used to selectively investigate the various phonon and\nmagnon excitation branches and will be a useful tool for advancing our\nunderstanding of spinor condensates.\n", "  Training artificial neural networks requires a tedious empirical evaluation\nto determine a suitable neural network architecture. To avoid this empirical\nprocess several techniques have been proposed to automatise the architecture\nselection process. In this paper, we propose a method to perform parameter and\narchitecture selection for a quantum weightless neural network (qWNN). The\narchitecture selection is performed through the learning procedure of a qWNN\nwith a learning algorithm that uses the principle of quantum superposition and\na non-linear quantum operator. The main advantage of the proposed method is\nthat it performs a global search in the space of qWNN architecture and\nparameters rather than a local search.\n", "  We suggest a simple method to engineer a tight-binding quantum network based\non proper coupling to an auxiliary non-Hermitian cluster. In particular, it is\nshown that effective complex non-Hermitian hopping rates can be realized with\nonly complex on-site energies in the network. Three applications of the\nHamiltonian engineering method are presented: the synthesis of a nearly\ntransparent defect in an Hermitian linear lattice; the realization of the\nFano-Anderson model with complex coupling; and the synthesis of a\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric tight-binding lattice with a bound state in the\ncontinuum.\n", "  Evaluating parton density systematic uncertainties in Monte~Carlo event\ngenerator predictions has long been achieved by reweighting between the\noriginal and systematic PDFs for the initial state configurations of the\nindividual simulated events. This weighting is now pre-emptively performed in\nmany generators, providing convenient weight factors for PDF and scale\nsystematics -- including for NLO calculations where counterterms make the\nweight calculation complex. This note attempts a pedagogical discussion and\nempirical study of the consequences of neglecting the effects of PDF variations\non the beyond-fixed-order components of MC models, and the implications for\nparton shower & MPI tuning strategies. We confirm that the effects are usually\nsmall, for well-understood reasons, and discuss the connected issue of\nconsistent treatment of the strong coupling between PDFs and parton showers,\nwhere motivations from physical principles and the need for good\ndata-description are not always well-aligned.\n", "  In this brief paper we present some results on creating and manipulating\nspectral gaps for a (regular) quantum graph by inserting appropriate internal\nstructures into its vertices. Complete proofs and extensions of the results are\nplanned for another publication.\n", "  The magnetic field that supports tokamak and stellarator plasmas must be\nproduced by coils well separated from the plasma. However the larger the\nseparation, the more difficult it is to produce a given magnetic field in the\nplasma region, so plasma configurations should be chosen that can be supported\nas efficiently as possible by distant coils. The efficiency of an\nexternally-generated magnetic field is a measure of the field's shaping\ncomponent magnitude at the plasma compared to the magnitude near the coils; the\nefficiency of a plasma equilibrium can be measured using the efficiency of the\nrequired external shaping field. Counterintuitively, plasma shapes with low\ncurvature and spectral width may have low efficiency, whereas plasma shapes\nwith sharp edges may have high efficiency. Two precise measures of magnetic\nfield efficiency, which correctly identify such differences in difficulty, will\nbe examined. These measures, which can be expressed as matrices, relate the\nexternally-produced normal magnetic field on the plasma surface to the either\nthe normal field or current on a distant control surface. A singular value\ndecomposition (SVD) of either matrix yields an efficiency ordered basis for the\nmagnetic field distributions. Calculations are carried out for both tokamak and\nstellarator cases. For axisymmetric surfaces with circular cross-section, the\nSVD is calculated analytically, and the range of poloidal and toroidal mode\nnumbers that can be controlled to a given desired level is determined. If\nformulated properly, these efficiency measures are independent of the\ncoordinates used to parameterize the surfaces.\n", "  Dust grains are classically thought to form in the winds of AGB stars.\nHowever, nowadays there is increasing evidence for dust formation in SNe. In\norder to establish the relative importance of these two classes of stellar\nsources of dust it is important to know what is the fraction of freshly formed\ndust in SN ejecta that is able to survive the passage of the reverse shock and\nbe injected in the interstellar medium. With this aim, we have developed a new\ncode, GRASH_Rev, that allows to follow the dynamics of dust grains in the\nshocked SN ejecta and to compute the time evolution of the mass, composition\nand size distribution of the grains. We consider four well studied SNe in the\nMilky Way and LMC: SN 1987a, Cas A, the Crab Nebula, and N49. For all the\nsimulated models, we find good agreement with observations. Our study suggests\nthat SN 1987A is too young for the reverse shock to have affected the dust\nmass. Conversely, in the other three SNe, the reverse shock has already\ndestroyed between 10 and 40% of the initial dust mass. However, the largest\ndust mass destruction is predicted to occur between 10^3 and 10^5 yr after the\nexplosions. Since the oldest SN in the sample has an estimated age of 4800 yr,\ncurrent observations can only provide an upper limit to the mass of SN dust\nthat will enrich the interstellar medium, the so-called effective dust yields.\nWe find that only between 1 and 8% of the currently observed mass will survive.\nThis is in good agreement with the values adopted in chemical evolution models\nwhich consider the effect of the SN reverse shock. We discuss the astrophysical\nimplications of our results for dust enrichment in local galaxies and at high\nredshift.\n", "  When strong spin-orbit coupling removes orbital degeneracy, it would at the\nsame time appear to render the Jahn-Teller mechanism ineffective. We discuss\nsuch a situation, the t_2g manifold of iridates, and show that, while the\nJahn-Teller effect does indeed not affect the j_eff=1/2 antiferromagnetically\nordered ground state, it leads to distinctive signatures in the j_eff=3/2\nspin-orbit exciton. It allows for a hopping of the spin-orbit exciton between\nthe nearest neighbor sites without producing defects in the j_eff=1/2\nantiferromagnet. This arises because the lattice-driven Jahn-Teller mechanism\nonly couples to the orbital degree of freedom, but is not sensitive to the\nphase of the wave function that defines isospin j_z. This contrasts sharply\nwith purely electronic propagation, which conserves isospin, and presence of\nJahn-Teller coupling can explain some of the peculiar features of measured\nresonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra of Sr_2IrO_4.\n", "  We present a high-precision differential abundance analysis of 16 solar-type\nstars in the Hyades open cluster based on high resolution, high signal-to-noise\nratio (S/N ~ 350 - 400) spectra obtained from the McDonald 2.7m telescope. We\nderived stellar parameters and differential chemical abundances for 19 elements\n(C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Ba)\nwith uncertainties as low as ~ 0.01 - 0.02 dex. Our main results include: (1)\nthere is no clear chemical signature of planet formation detected among the\nsample stars, i.e., no correlations in abundances versus condensation\ntemperature; (2) the observed abundance dispersions are a factor of ~ 1.5 - 2\nlarger than the average measurement errors for most elements; (3) there are\npositive correlations, of high statistical significance, between the abundances\nof at least 90% of pairs of elements. We demonstrate that none of these\nfindings can be explained by errors due to the stellar parameters. Our results\nreveal that the Hyades is chemically inhomogeneous at the 0.02 dex level.\nPossible explanations for the abundance variations include (1) inhomogeneous\nchemical evolution in the proto-cluster environment, (2) supernova ejection in\nthe proto-cluster cloud, and (3) pollution of metal-poor gas before complete\nmixing of the proto-cluster cloud. Our results provide significant new\nconstraints on the chemical composition of open clusters and a challenge to the\ncurrent view of Galactic archeology.\n", "  We study the squared width and the profile of flux tubes in compact U(1)\nlattice gauge theory in three spacetime dimensions. The results obtained from\nnumerical calculations in the dual formulation of this confining theory are\ncompared with predictions from an effective bosonic-string model and from the\ndual-superconductor model: it is found that the former fails at describing the\nquantitative features of the flux tube, while the latter is in good agreement\nwith Monte Carlo data. The analytical interpretation of these results (in the\nlight of the semi-classical analysis by Polyakov) is pointed out, and a\ncomparison with non-Abelian gauge theories in four spacetime dimensions is\ndiscussed.\n", "  In the last several decades, heat transfer enhancements using extended\nsurface (fins) has received considerable attentions. A new heat transfer\nenhancement technique, longitudinal vortex generators (LVG), has received\nsignificant attention since the 1990s. It is activated by a special type of\nextended surface that can generate vortices with axes parallel to the main flow\ndirection. The vortices result from strong swirling secondary flow caused by\nflow separation and friction. The state-of-the-art on research and applications\nof LVG are described here. The topical coverage includes heat transfer\nenhancement in straight channels and in heat exchangers. Among the latter are\nplate and wavy fin-and-tube heat exchangers, fin-and-oval-tube heat exchangers,\nand fin-and-tube heat exchangers with multiple rows of tubes. The trends and\nfuture directions of heat transfer enhancement by means of LVG are discussed.\n", "  In this work, we propose a quantum neural network named quantum perceptron\nover a field (QPF). Quantum computers are not yet a reality and the models and\nalgorithms proposed in this work cannot be simulated in actual (or classical)\ncomputers. QPF is a direct generalization of a classical perceptron and solves\nsome drawbacks found in previous models of quantum perceptrons. We also present\na learning algorithm named Superposition based Architecture Learning algorithm\n(SAL) that optimizes the neural network weights and architectures. SAL searches\nfor the best architecture in a finite set of neural network architectures with\nlinear time over the number of patterns in the training set. SAL is the first\nlearning algorithm to determine neural network architectures in polynomial\ntime. This speedup is obtained by the use of quantum parallelism and a\nnon-linear quantum operator.\n", "  Single organic molecules offer great promise as bright, reliable sources of\nidentical single photons on demand, capable of integration into solid-state\ndevices. It has been proposed that such molecules in a crystalline organic\nmatrix might be placed close to an optical waveguide for this purpose, but so\nfar there have been no demonstrations of sufficiently thin crystals, with a\ncontrolled concentration of suitable dopant molecules. Here we present a method\nfor growing very thin anthracene crystals from super-saturated vapour, which\nproduces crystals of extreme flatness and controlled thickness. We show how\nthis crystal can be doped with a widely adjustable concentration of\ndibenzoterrylene (DBT) molecules and we examine the optical properties of these\nmolecules to demonstrate their suitability as quantum emitters in nanophotonic\ndevices. Our measurements show that the molecules are available in the crystal\nas single quantum emitters, with a well-defined polarisation relative to the\ncrystal axes, making them amenable to alignment with optical nanostructures. We\nfind that the radiative lifetime and saturation intensity vary little within\nthe crystal and are not in any way compromised by the unusual matrix\nenvironment. We show that a large fraction of these emitters are able to\ndeliver more than $10^{12}$ photons without photo-bleaching, making them\nsuitable for real applications.\n", "  The scaling behavior of model C describing the dynamical behaviour of the\n$n$-component nonconserved order parameter coupled statically to a scalar\nconserved density is considered in $d$-dimensional space. Conditions for the\nrealization of different types of scaling regimes in the $(n,d)$ plane are\nstudied within the field-theoretical renormalization group approach. Borders\nseparating these regions are calculated on the base of high-order RG functions\nusing $\\epsilon$-expansions as well as by fixed dimension $d$ approach with\nresummation.\n", "  A resonance $Y(4630)$ at the invariant mass spectrum of $\\Lambda_c\n\\bar\\Lambda_c$ observed by the Belle Collaboration triggers a hot discussion\nabout its inner structure. Since it preferably decays into two charmed baryons\n$\\Lambda_c\\bar\\Lambda_c$, it is tempted to conjecture it as a tetraquark.\nBecause the dominant decay portal $Y(4630)\\to \\Lambda_c \\bar\\Lambda_c$ is close\nto the energy threshold, the final state interactions may be significant and\nresult in other baryonic and/or mesonic final states whose branching fractions\nare sizable to be measured in the future experiments. In this work we calculate\nthe branching ratios of the $Y(4630)$ decays into $p\\bar p$, $D^{(*)+}\nD^{(*)-}$, $\\pi^+\\pi^-$, and $K^+K^-$ which are induced by the $\\Lambda_c\n\\bar\\Lambda_c$ re-scattering. The resultant decay patterns will be tested by\nthe future experiments and the consistency degree with the data composes a\nvaluable probe for the tetraquark conjecture.\n", "  Cosmogenic isotopes provide the only quantitative proxy for analyzing the\nlong-term solar variability over a centennial timescale. While essential\nprogress has been achieved in both measurements and modeling of the cosmogenic\nproxy, uncertainties still remain in the determination of the geomagnetic\ndipole moment evolution. Here we improve the reconstruction of solar activity\nover the past nine millennia using a multi-proxy approach. We used records of\nthe 14C and 10Be cosmogenic isotopes, current numerical models of the isotope\nproduction and transport in Earth's atmosphere, and available geomagnetic field\nreconstructions, including a new reconstruction relying on an updated\narcheo-/paleointensity database. The obtained series were analyzed using the\nsingular spectrum analysis (SSA) method to study the millennial-scale trends. A\nnew reconstruction of the geomagnetic dipole field moment, GMAG.9k, is built\nfor the last nine millennia. New reconstructions of solar activity covering the\nlast nine millennia, quantified in sunspot numbers, are presented and analyzed.\nA conservative list of grand minima and maxima is provided. The primary\ncomponents of the reconstructed solar activity, as determined using the SSA\nmethod, are different for the series based on 14C and 10Be. These primary\ncomponents can only be ascribed to long-term changes in the terrestrial system\nand not to the Sun. They have been removed from the reconstructed series. In\ncontrast, the secondary SSA components of the reconstructed solar activity are\nfound to be dominated by a common ~2400-yr quasi-periodicity, the so-called\nHallstatt cycle, in both the 14C and 10Be based series. This Hallstatt cycle\nthus appears to be related to solar activity. Finally, we show that the grand\nminima and maxima occurred intermittently over the studied period, with\nclustering near highs and lows of the Hallstatt cycle, respectively.\n", "  In this paper we discuss finiteness and ambiguities of the higher-derivative\nLorentz-breaking terms in extended QED with a magnetic coupling at the finite\ntemperature. We find that, beside of the higher-derivative\nCarroll-Field-Jackiw-like term and Myers-Pospelov term, many new terms arise in\na finite temperature case, but most of them vanish in high temperature limit.\n", "  We present a single barrier system to generate pure valley-polarized current\nin monolayer graphene. A uniaxial strain is applied within the barrier region,\nwhich is delineated by localized magnetic field created by ferromagnetic\nstripes at the regions boundaries. We show that under the condition of matching\nmagnetic field strength, strain potential, and Fermi energy, the transmitted\ncurrent is composed of only one valley contribution. The desired valley current\ncan transmit with zero reflection while the electrons from the other valley are\ntotally reflected. Thus, the system generates pure valley-polarized current\nwith maximum conductance. The chosen parameters of uniaxial strain and magnetic\nfield are in the range of experimental feasibility, which suggests that the\nproposed scheme can be realized with current technology.\n", "  Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are relatively a recently-discovered\nphenomenon, in 1971, some fifteen years into the Space Era. It took another two\ndecades to realize that CMEs are the most important players in solar\nterrestrial relationship as the root cause of severe weather in Earth's space\nenvironment. CMEs are now counted among the major natural hazards because they\ncause large solar energetic particle (SEP) events and major geomagnetic storms,\nboth of which pose danger to humans and their technology in space and ground.\nGeomagnetic storms discovered in the 1700s, solar flares discovered in the\n1800s, and SEP events discovered in the1900s are all now found to be closely\nrelated to CMEs via various physical processes occurring at various locations\nin and around CMEs, when they interact with the ambient medium. This article\nidentifies a number of key developments that preceded the discovery of\nwhite-light CMEs suggesting that CMEs were waiting to be discovered. The last\ntwo decades witnessed an explosion of CME research following the launch of the\nSolar and Heliospheric Observatory mission in 1995, resulting in the\nestablishment of a full picture of CMEs.\n", "  We define an approach to identify overlapping communities in multiplex\nnetworks, extending the popular clique percolation method for simple graphs.\nThe extension requires to rethink the basic concepts on which the clique\npercolation algorithm is based, including cliques and clique adjacency, to\nallow the presence of multiple types of edges.\n", "  We report neutron scattering and muon spin relaxation measurements (muSR) on\nthe pyrochlore antiferromagnet Yb2Ge2O7. Inelastic neutron scattering was used\nto probe the transitions between crystal electric field levels, allowing us to\ndetermine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors appropriate to the J=7/2 Yb3+ ion in\nthis environment. The crystal electric field ground state doublet in Yb2Ge2O7\ncorresponds primarily to m_J = +/- 1/2 with local XY anisotropy, consistent\nwith an S_eff = 1/2 description for the Yb moments. muSR measurements reveal\nthe presence of an ordering transition at T_N = 0.57 K with persistent weak\ndynamics in the ordered state. Finally, we present neutron diffraction\nmeasurements that reveal a clear phase transition to the k = (000) Gamma_5\nground state with an ordered magnetic moment of 0.3(1) mu_B per Yb ion. We\ncompare and contrast this phenomenology with the low temperature behavior of\nYb2Ti2O7 and Er2Ti2O7, the prototypical S_eff = 1/2 XY pyrochlore magnets.\n", "  In this paper we continue the study of the physical consequences of our\nmodified black hole entropy formula in expanding spacetimes. In particular, we\napply the new formula to apparent horizons of Friedmann expanding universes\nwith zero, negative and positive spatial curvature. As a first result, we found\nthat, apart from the static Einstein solution, the only Friedmann spacetimes\nwith constant (zero) internal energy are the ones with zero spatial curvature.\nThis happens because, in the computation of the internal energy $U$, the\ncontribution due to the non-vanishing Hubble flow must been added to the usual\nMisner-Sharp energy giving, for zero curvature spacetimes, a zero value for\n$U$. This fact does not hold when curvature is present. After analyzing the\nfree energy $F$, we obtain the correct result that $F$ is stationary only for\nphysical systems in isothermal equilibrium, i.e. a de Sitter expanding\nuniverse. This result permits us to trace back a physically reasonable\nhypothesis concerning the origin of the early and late times de Sitter phase of\nour universe. Finally, we deduce an interesting temperature-length inequality\nsimilar to the time-energy uncertainty of ordinary quantum mechanics but with\ntemperature instead of time coordinate. Remarkably, this relation is\nindependent on the gravitational constant $G$ and can thus be explored also in\nnon gravitational contexts.\n", "  This paper is a rebuttal to Eur. Phys. Jour. Plus 130, 191 (2015), which\nclaims that the results in arXiv:1502.04911 (Ann. Phys. 355, 360 (2015)) are\nincorrect. For this reason, some of the results in arXiv:1502.04911 have been\nreviewed and clarified. The results in this paper are dedicated to the 100th\nanniversary of Albert Einstein's presentation of the complete General Theory of\nRelativity to the Prussian Academy.\n", "  BaTiO3 appears in cubic and hexagonal variants, both of which are\ncentrosymmetric. Samples of cubic BaTiO3 are known to exhibit breaking of the\ncentric symmetry locally and globally. It has been proposed that the local\nsymmetry breaking originates in polar regions, the precursors of the\nferroelectric phase. Origins of the macroscopic symmetry breaking, which are\nnot well understood, have been previously tentatively correlated with\ninhomogeneities in the samples, such as strain gradients that may align or\nredistribute objects such as charged point defects or polar regions making\nmaterial macroscopically polar. No such data are available for BaTiO3 with\nhexagonal symmetry. We compare dielectric, elastic, and pyroelectric properties\nof the two materials in polycrystalline form. In contrast to cubic BaTiO3,\nhexagonal BaTiO3 does not exhibit macroscopic pyroelectric response at room\ntemperature. This is consistent with apparent absence of polar regions in the\nhexagonal material and the fact that in hexagonal BaTiO3 strain rather then\npolarization is the order parameter for the phase transition into\nferroelectric-ferroelastic phase. The thermally stimulated currents measured in\nhexagonal and cubic BaTiO3, however, show that both materials exhibit\nnoncentric macroscopic symmetry. This result supports the idea that extrinsic\nfactors such as strain gradients, which are apparently common for both\nmaterials, may break the macroscopic symmetry, which may then lead to alignment\nand redistribution of polar regions or charged defects.\n", "  It is known that peculiar plasmons whose frequencies are purely imaginary\nexist in the interior of a two-dimensional electronic system described by the\nDrude model. We show that when an external magnetic field is applied to the\nsystem, these bulk plasmons are still non-oscillating and are isolated from the\nmagnetoplasmons by the energy gap of the cyclotron frequency. These are mainly\nin a transverse magnetic mode and can combine with a transverse electronic mode\nlocally at an edge of the system to form edge magnetoplasmons. With this\nobservation, we reveal the intrinsic long lifetime of edge magnetoplasmons for\nthe first time.\n", "  We present a spectroscopic survey of known and candidate $\\gamma$\\,Doradus\nstars. The high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of 52 objects were\ncollected by five different spectrographs. The spectral classification,\natmospheric parameters (\\teff, $\\log g$, $\\xi$), $v\\sin i$ and chemical\ncomposition of the stars were derived. The stellar spectral and luminosity\nclasses were found between G0-A7 and IV-V, respectively. The initial values for\n\\teff\\ and \\logg\\ were determined from the photometric indices and spectral\nenergy distribution. Those parameters were improved by the analysis of hydrogen\nlines. The final values of \\teff, \\logg\\ and $\\xi$ were derived from the iron\nlines analysis. The \\teff\\ values were found between 6000\\,K and 7900\\,K, while\n\\logg\\,values range from 3.8 to 4.5\\,dex. Chemical abundances and $v\\sin i$\nvalues were derived by the spectrum synthesis method. The $v\\sin i$ values were\nfound between 5 and 240\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$. The chemical abundance pattern of\n$\\gamma$\\,Doradus stars were compared with the pattern of non-pulsating stars.\nIt turned out that there is no significant difference in abundance patterns\nbetween these two groups. Additionally, the relations between the atmospheric\nparameters and the pulsation quantities were checked. A strong correlation\nbetween the $v\\sin i$ and the pulsation periods of $\\gamma$\\,Doradus variables\nwas obtained. The accurate positions of the analysed stars in the H-R diagram\nhave been shown. Most of our objects are located inside or close to the blue\nedge of the theoretical instability strip of $\\gamma$\\,Doradus.\n", "  A three-dimensional (3D) Dirac semimetal (DS) is an analogue of graphene, but\nwith linear energy dispersion in all (three) momentum directions.3D DSs have\nbeen a fertile playground in discovering novel quantum particles, for example\nWeyl fermions, in solid state systems.Many 3D DSs (e.g., ZrTe5) were\ntheoretically predicted. We report here the results from the studies of\naberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and low\ntemperature magneto-transport measurements in exfoliated ZrTe5 thin\nflakes.Several unique results were observed. First, an\nanomalous-Hall-effect-like behavior was observed around zero magnetic field\n(B).Second, a non-trivial Berry's phase of \\pi\\ was obtained from the Landau\nlevel fan diagram of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the longitudinal\nresistivity. Third, the longitudinal resistivity shows linear B field\ndependence in the quantum limit. Most surprisingly, quantum oscillations were\nobserved at fractional Landau level indices N = 2/3 and 2/5, demonstrating\nstrong electron-electron interactions effects in ZrTe5.\n", "  We quantize the interaction of gravity with a Yang-Mills and Higgs field\nusing canonical quantization. Similar to the approach in a previous paper we\ndiscard the Wheeler-DeWitt equation and express the Hamilton constraint by the\nevolution equation of the mean curvature of the hypersurfaces in the foliation\ndefined by the Hamiltonian setting. Expressing the time derivative of the mean\ncurvature with the help of the Poisson brackets the canonical quantization of\nthis equation leads to a wave equation in $Q=(0,\\infty)\\times \\cal{S}_o$, where\n$\\cal{S}_o$ is one of the Cauchy hypersurfaces in the Hamiltonian setting. The\nwave equation describes the interaction of an arbitrary Riemannian metric in\n$\\cal{S}_o$ and a given Yang-Mills and Higgs field. If the metric is complete\n$Q$ is globally hyperbolic. In case $\\cal{S}_o$ is compact we also prove a\nspectral resolution of the wave equation and establish sufficient conditions\nguaranteeing a mass gap.\n", "  The present work deals with dynamics of gravitational collapse with\ncylindrical symmetry as developed by Misner and Sharp. The interior collapsing\nanisotropic cylindrical perfect fluid is matched to an exterior vacuum\ncylindrically symmetric space-time due to Einstein--Rosen using the Darmois\nmatching conditions. It is found that the radial pressure of the anisotropic\nperfect fluid is non-zero on the boundary surface and is related to the\ncomponents of shear viscosity. As a result, there is formation of gravitational\nwaves outside the collapsing matter.\n", "  I will argue that the inertial mass is greater than the gravitational mass\nfor all objects which are held together primarily by gravitational forces.\nThus, for celestial objects, like planets, stars and galaxies, their inertial\nmass is greater than their gravitational mass. The analysis used to arrive at\nthis conclusion shows that there should, in principle, exist classical objects\nwith non-zero inertial mass and vanishing gravitational mass. Implications for\nQuantum Gravity and Quantum Cosmology, are briefly discussed.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in a\nsoliplasmonic system where the asymmetrical coupling between linear solitons\nand nonlinear plasmons is controlled by the weak soliton amplitude. We employ\nnon-Hermitian quantum dynamics to evaluate quantum steering witnesses for\ndifferent coupling strengths. Quantum steering is examined for an initially\nFock state and we briefly discuss Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen entanglement for\ninitially coherent states. We numerically investigate the adjustability of the\nwitnessing periods of quantum steering via tunable coupling strength of\nsoliton-plasmon interaction and discuss the possibility of the nonlinear\nsoliplasmonic systems as a robust platform for implementing one-sided quantum\nkey distributions.\n", "  The advent of enhanced technologies in radio interferometry and the\nperspective of the SKA telescope bring new challenges in image reconstruction.\nOne of these challenges is the spatio-spectral reconstruction of large\n(Terabytes) data cubes with high fidelity. This contribution proposes an\nalternative implementation of one such 3D prototype algorithm, MUFFIN\n(MUlti-Frequency image reconstruction For radio INterferometry), which combines\nspatial and spectral analysis priors. Using a recently proposed primal dual\nalgorithm, this new version of MUFFIN allows a parallel implementation where\ncomputationally intensive steps are split by spectral channels. This\nparallelization allows to implement computationally demanding translation\ninvariant wavelet transforms (IUWT), as opposed to the union of bases used\npreviously. This alternative implementation is important as it opens the\npossibility of comparing these efficient dictionaries, and others, in\nspatio-spectral reconstruction. Numerical results show that the IUWT-based\nversion can be successfully implemented at large scale with performances\ncomparable to union of bases.\n", "  Quantum spin liquids are exotic Mott insulators that carry extraordinary spin\nexcitations and thus, when doped, expected to afford novel metallic states\ncoupled to the unconventional magnetic excitations. The organic\ntriangular-lattice system k-(ET)4Hg2.89Br8 is a promising candidate for the\ndoped spin-liquid and hosts a non-Fermi liquid at low pressures. We show that,\nin the non-Fermi liquid regime, the charge transport confined in the layer gets\ndeconfined sharply at low temperatures, coinciding with the entrance of spins\ninto a quantum regime as signified by a steep decrease in spin susceptibility\nbehaving like the triangular-lattice Heisenberg model indicative of spin-charge\nseparation at high temperatures. This suggests a new type of non-Fermi liquid,\nwhere interlayer charge-deconfimement is associated with spin-charge\nentanglement.\n", "  The negatively-charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond has been shown\nrecently as an excellent sensor for external spins. Nevertheless, their optimum\nengineering in the near-surface region still requires quantitative knowledge in\nregard to their activation by vacancy capture during thermal annealing. To this\naim, we report on the depth profiles of near-surface helium-induced NV centers\n(and related helium defects) by step-etching with nanometer resolution. This\nprovides insights into the efficiency of vacancy diffusion and recombination\npaths concurrent to the formation of NV centers. It was found that the range of\nefficient formation of NV centers is limited only to approximately $10$ to\n$15\\,$nm (radius) around the initial ion track of irradiating helium atoms.\nUsing this information we demonstrate the fabrication of nanometric-thin\n($\\delta$) profiles of NV centers for sensing external spins at the diamond\nsurface based on a three-step approach, which comprises (i) nitrogen-doped\nepitaxial CVD diamond overgrowth, (ii) activation of NV centers by low-energy\nhelium irradiation and thermal annealing, and (iii) controlled layer thinning\nby low-damage plasma etching. Spin coherence times (Hahn echo) ranging up to\n$50\\,$ $\\mu$s are demonstrated at depths of less than $5\\,$nm in material with\n$1.1\\,\\%$ of $^{13}$C (depth estimated by spin relaxation (T$_1$)\nmeasurements). At the end, the limits of the helium irradiation technique at\nhigh ion fluences are also experimentally investigated.\n", "  We study the hypothesis of information panspermia assigned recently among\npossible solutions of the Fermi paradox (\"where are the aliens?\"). It suggests\nthat the expenses of alien signaling can be significantly reduced, if their\nmessages contain compressed information. To this end we consider universal\ncompression and decoding mechanisms (e.g. the Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm) that\ncan reveal non-random structures in compressed bit strings. The efficiency of\nKolmogorov stochasticity parameter for detection of non-randomness is\nillustrated, along with the Zipf's law. The universality of these methods, i.e.\nindependence on data details, can be principal in searching for intelligent\nmessages.\n", "  Understanding the covalent clathrate formation is a crucial point for the\ndesign of new superhard materials with intrinsic coupling of superhardness and\nmetallic conductivity. Silicon clathrates have the archetype structures that\ncan serve an existant model compounds for superhard clathrate frameworks\n\"Si-B\", \"Si-C\", \"B-C\" and \"C\" with intercalated atoms (e.g. alkali metals or\neven halogenes) that can assure the metalic properties. Here we report the in\nsitu and ex situ studies of high-pressure formation and stability of clathrates\nNa8Si46 (structure I) and Na24+xSi136 (structure II). Experiments have been\nperformed using standard Paris-Edinburgh cells (opposite anvils) up to 6 GPa\nand 1500 K. We have established that chemical interactions in Na-Si system and\ntransition between two structures of clathrates occur at temperatures below\nsilicon melting. The strong sensitivity of crystallization products to the\nsodium concentration have been observed. A tentative diagram of clathrate\ntransformations has been proposed. At least up to ~6 GPa, Na24+xSi136\n(structure II) is stable at lower temperatures as compared to Na8Si46\n(structure I).\n", "  In this paper, we explore the stability of an inverted pendulum under a\ngeneralized parametric excitation described by a superposition of $N$ cosines\nwith different amplitudes and frequencies, based on a simple stability\ncondition that does not require any use of Lyapunov exponent, for example. Our\nanalysis is separated in 3 different cases: $N=1$, $N=2$, and $N$ very large.\nOur results were obtained via numerical simulations by fourth-order Runge Kutta\nintegration of the non-linear equations. We also calculate the effective\npotential also for $N>2$. We show then that numerical integrations recover a\nwider region of stability that are not captured by the (approximated)\nanalytical method. We also analyze stochastic stabilization here: firstly, we\nlook the effects of external noise in the stability diagram by enlarging the\nvariance, and secondly, when $N$ is large, we rescale the amplitude by showing\nthat the diagrams for time survival of the inverted pendulum resembles the\nexact case for $N=1$. Finally, we find numerically the optimal number of\ncosines corresponding to the maximal survival probability of the pendulum.\n", "  By measuring the fundamental constants in astrophysical objects one can test\nbasic physical principles as space-time invariance of physical laws along with\nprobing the applicability limits of the standard model of particle physics. The\nlatest constraints on the fine structure constant alpha and the\nelectron-to-proton mass ratio mu obtained from observations at high redshifts\nand in the Milky Way disk are reviewed. In optical range, the most accurate\nmeasurements have already reached the sensitivity limit of available\ninstruments, and further improvements will be possible only with next\ngeneration of telescopes and receivers. New methods of the wavelength\ncalibration should be realized to control systematic errors at the sub-pixel\nlevel. In radio sector, the main tasks are the search for galactic and\nextragalactic objects suitable for precise molecular spectroscopy as well as\nhigh resolution laboratory measurements of molecular lines to provide accurate\nfrequency standards. The expected progress in the optical and radio\nastrophysical observations is quantified.\n", "  Small-amplitude waves in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) lattice with weakly\nanharmonic interaction potentials are described by the generalized Korteweg-de\nVries (KdV) equation. Justification of the small-amplitude approximation is\nusually performed on the time scale, for which dynamics of the KdV equation is\ndefined. We show how to extend justification analysis on longer time intervals\nprovided dynamics of the generalized KdV equation is globally well-posed in\nSobolev spaces and either the Sobolev norms are globally bounded or they grow\nat most polynomially. The time intervals are extended respectively by the\nlogarithmic or double logarithmic factors in terms of the small amplitude\nparameter. Controlling the approximation error on longer time intervals allows\nus to deduce nonlinear metastability of small FPU solitary waves from orbital\nstability of the KdV solitary waves.\n", "  There is experimental and histological evidence that chronic irritation and\ncell death may cause hyperplasia in the exposed tissue. As the heterogeneous\ndeposition of inhaled radon progeny results in high local doses at the peak of\nthe bronchial bifurcations, it was proposed earlier that hyperplasia occurs in\nthese deposition hot spots upon chronic radon exposure. The objective of the\npresent study is to quantify how the induction of basal cell hyperplasia\nmodulates the microdosimetric consequences of a given radon exposure. For this\npurpose, numerical epithelium models were generated with spherical cell nuclei\nof six different cell types based on histological data. Basal cell hyperplasia\nwas modelled by epithelium models with additional basal cells and increased\nepithelium thickness. Microdosimetry for alpha-particles was performed by an\nown-developed Monte-Carlo code. Results show that the average tissue dose, and\nthe average hit number and dose of basal cells decrease by the increase of the\nmeasure of hyperplasia. Hit and dose distribution reveal that the induction of\nhyperplasia may result in a basal cell pool which is shielded from alpha\nradiation. It highlights that the exposure history affects the microdosimetric\nconsequences of a present exposure, while the biological and health effects may\nalso depend on previous exposures. The induction of hyperplasia can be\nconsidered as a radioadaptive response at the tissue level. Such an adaptation\nof the tissue challenges the validity of the application of the dose dose rate\neffectiveness factor from a mechanistic point of view. As the location of\nradiosensitive target cells may change due to previous exposures, dosimetry\nmodels considering the tissue geometry characteristic of normal conditions may\nbe inappropriate for dose estimation in case of protracted exposures. As\ninternal exposures are frequently chronic, such changes in tissue...\n", "  The conventional Josephson effect may be modified by introducing spin-active\nscattering in the interface-layer of the junction. Here, we discuss a Josephson\njunction consisting of two s-wave superconducting leads coupled over a\nclassical spin that precesses with the Larmor frequency due to an external\nmagnetic field. This magnetically active interface results in a time-dependent\nboundary condition with different tunnelling amplitudes for spin-up and -down\nquasiparticles and where the precession produces spin-flip scattering\nprocesses. As a result, the Andreev states develop sidebands and a\nnon-equilibrium population that depend on the details of the spin precession.\nThe Andreev states carry a steady-state Josephson charge current and a\ntime-dependent spin current, whose current-phase relations could be used for\ncharacterising the precessing spin. The spin current is supported by\nspin-triplet correlations induced by the spin precession and creates a\nfeed-back effect on the classical spin in the form of a torque that shifts the\nprecession frequency.\n  By applying a bias voltage, the Josephson frequency adds another complexity\nto the situation and may create resonances together with the Larmor frequency.\nThese Shapiro resonances are manifested as torques and are, under suitable\nconditions, able to reverse the direction of the classical spin in\nsub-nanosecond time. Another characteristic feature is the subharmonic gap\nstructure in the dc charge current displaying an even-odd effect that is\nattributable to precession-assisted multiple Andreev reflections.\n", "  The LDA-1/2 method expands Slater's half occupation technique to infinite\nsolid state materials by introducing a self-energy potential centered at the\nanions to cancel the energy associated with electron-hole self-interaction. To\navoid an infinite summation of long-ranged self-energy potentials they must be\ntrimmed at a variationally-defined cutoff radius. The method has been\nsuccessful in predicting accurate band gaps for a large number of elementary\nand binary semiconductors. Nevertheless, there has been some confusion\nregarding carbon and silicon, both in the cubic diamond structure, which\nrequire different ionizations of the valence charge, 1/2 for carbon and 1/4 for\nsilicon respectively, to yield band gaps in agreement with experimental data.\nWe here analyze the spatial distribution of the valence electrons of these two\nmaterials to conclude that in silicon and in carbon LDA-1/4 and LDA-1/2,\nrespectively, must be adopted for the proper cancellation of the self-energies.\nSuch analysis should be applied to other covalent semiconductors in order to\ndecide which ionization to adopt for the proper correction of the self-energy.\n", "  The Brans-Dicke action is one of the most natural extensions of the\nEinstein-Hilbert action. It is based on the introduction of a fundamental\nscalar field that effectively incorporates a dynamics to the gravitational\ncoupling $G$. In spite of the diverse motivations and the rich phenomenology\nthat comes from its solutions, Solar System tests impose strong constraints on\nthe Brans-Dicke theory, rendering it indistinguishable from General Relativity.\nIn the present text, new perspectives for the Brans-Dicke theory are presented,\nbased on the possibility that the scalar field presented in the BD theory can\nbe external, as well as on the applications to black hole physics and the\nprimordial universe.\n", "  Devastating floods in northeast Pakistan and northern India occurred in July\n2010 and September 2014 as a consequence of extreme precipitation events. The\n2010 and 2014 flood events had similar synoptic flow patterns that led to an\nanomalously high moisture content in the flood region. The quasi-geostrophic\nomega equation is inverted in order to attribute components of the large-scale\nvertical motion profile to synoptic forcing, diabatic heating, and mechanically\nforced orographic ascent. The results show that diabatic heating is the\ndominant contributor to the large-scale vertical motion, and suggest that the\norographic forcing by flow over the Himalayas is the dominant mechanism by\nwhich the convection that produces the heating is forced. Analysis of a longer\ndata record shows that instances of extreme precipitation in this region over\nthe last eleven years are closely associated with simultaneously large values\nof orographic forcing and column-total precipitable water vapor.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the application of the fringe-locking method\n(FLM) in the dual-species quantum test of the weak equivalence principle (WEP).\nWith the FLM, the measurement is performed invariably at the midfringe, and the\nextraction of the phase shift for atom interferometers is linearized. For the\nsimultaneous interferometers, this linearization enables a good common-mode\nrejection of vibration noise, which is usually the main limit for high\nprecision WEP tests of dual-species kind. We note that this method also allows\nfor an unbiased determination of the gravity accelerations difference, which\nmeanwhile is readily to be implemented.\n", "  Using entropic inequalities for Shannon entropies new inequalities for some\nclassical polynomials are obtained. To this end, photon distribution functions\nfor one-, two- and multi-mode squeezed states in terms of Hermite, Laguerre,\nLegendre polynomials and Gauss' hypergeometric functions are used. The\ndependence between the violation of the quadrature uncertainty relation, the\nsign and the existence of the distribution function of such states is\nconsidered.\n", "  We report detailed study of the transport properties of FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$\n($x$ = 0 and 0.14) single crystals grown by vapor transport method. 14\\% S\ndoping is found significantly suppress the structural transition from $T_s$\n$\\sim$ 86 K in FeSe to $\\sim$ 49 K, although the superconducting transition\ntemperature, $T_c$, is only slightly affected. A pronounced linear\nmagnetoresistance (MR) is observed in both FeSe and FeSe$_{0.86}$S$_{0.14}$\nsingle crystals, which is found to be triggered by the structural transition.\nThe linear MR and related discussion indicate the possible existence of\nDirac-cone-like state, which may come from the band shift induced by\nferro-orbital order. The mobility of the Dirac-cone-like band is found to\ndecrease after S doping. Besides, the invalid Kohler's scaling of MR is found\nfor temperature below $T_s$ in both crystals, however the re-establishment of\nthe Kohler's scaling at temperatures below 30 K is observed in FeSe, but not in\nFeSe$_{0.86}$S$_{0.14}$. All these observations above support that the orbital\nordering causes the band reconstruction in FeSe, and also that the orbital\nordering in FeSe is suppressed by the chemical pressure from S doping.\n", "  Abell 754 is a galaxy cluster in which an ongoing merger is evident on the\nplane of the sky, from the southeast to the northwest. We study the spatial\nvariation of the X-ray spectra observed with Suzaku along the merging\ndirection, centering on the Fe Ly-alpha / Fe He-alpha line ratio to search for\npossible deviation from ionization equilibrium. Fitting with a single\ntemperature collisional non-equilibrium plasma model shows that the electron\ntemperature increases from the southeast to the northwest. The ionization\nparameter is consistent with that in equilibrium (n_et>10^{13} s cm^{-3})\nexcept for a specific region with the highest temperature\n(kT=13.3^{+1.4}_{-1.1} keV) where n_et=10^{11.6^{+0.6}_{-1.7}} s cm^{-3}. The\nelapsed time from the plasma heating estimated from the ionization parameter is\n0.36-76 Myr at the 90% confidence level. This time scale is quite short but\nconsistent with the traveling time of a shock to pass through that region. We\nthus interpret that the non-equilibrium ionization plasma in Abell 754 observed\nis a remnant of the shock heating in the merger process. We, however, note that\nthe X-ray spectrum of the specific region where the non-equilibrium is found\ncan also be fitted with a collisional ionization plasma model with two\ntemperatures, low kT=4.2^{+4.2}_{-1.5} keV and very high kT > 19.3 keV. The\nvery high temperature component is alternatively fitted with a power law model.\nEither of these spectral models is interpreted as a consequence of the ongoing\nmerger process as in the case of that with the non-equilibrium ionization\nplasma.\n", "  We present here our results on the hour like time scale X-ray flux variations\nin a sample of active galactic nuclei using data from the Nuclear Spectroscopic\nTelescope Array (NuSTAR). We find that in the 3-79 keV band, BL Lacs are more\nvariable than flat spectrum radio quasars and Seyfert galaxies. Among Seyferts,\nSeyfert 2s are more variable than Seyfert 1s. Also, radio-loud quasars are more\nvariable in the hard (10-79 keV) band than the soft (3-10 keV) band while,\nSeyfert galaxies tend to show more variations in the soft band relative to the\nhard band.\n", "  The possibility of immunized and improving the entanglement of accelerated\nsystems via local filtering is discussed. The maximum bounds of entanglement\ndepend on the dimensions of the accelerated and the filtered subsystems. If the\nsmall dimensional subsystem is accelerated and the large dimensional subsystem\nis filtered, one can get a long-lived entanglement. Moreover, if the larger\nsubsystem is accelerated, then by filtering any subsystem, the upper bounds of\nentanglement of the filtered state are larger then that for the initial\nstates.For any accelerated subsystem, the entanglement always increases as the\nfilter strength of the large dimensional subsystem increases.\n", "  This paper considers the problem of constructing a direct coupling quantum\nobserver for a quantum harmonic oscillator system. The proposed observer is\nshown to be able to estimate one but not both of the plant variables and\nproduces a measureable output using homodyne detection.\n", "  We model the observed X-ray spectral continuum shape, ionic column densities,\nand absorption measure distribution (AMD) of the warm absorber in the Seyfert\ngalaxy NGC 3783. We assume a photo-ionized medium with a uniform total\n(gas+radiation) pressure. The irradiation causes the wind to be radiation\npressure compressed (RPC). We compare the observational characteristics derived\nfrom the 900 ksec Chandra observation to radiative transfer computations in\npressure equilibrium using the radiative transfer code TITAN. We explore\ndifferent values of the ionization parameter xi of the incident flux and adjust\nthe hydrogen-equivalent column density, N_H0 of the warm absorber to match the\nobserved soft X-ray continuum. We derive theoretical column densities for a\nbroad range of ionic species of iron and neon and an AMD that we compare to the\nobservations. We find an extension of the degeneracy between xi and N_H0 for\nthe constant pressure models previously discussed for NGC 3783. Including the\nionic column densities of iron and neon in the comparison between observations\nand data we conclude that a range of ionization parameters between 4000 and\n8000 ergs cm/s is preferred. For the first time, we present theoretical AMD for\na constant pressure wind in NGC 3783 that correctly reproduces the observed\nlevel and is in approximate agreement with the observational appearance of an\ninstability region. Using a variety of observational indicators, we confirm\nthat the X-ray outflow of NGC 3783 can be described as an RPC medium in\npressure equilibrium. The observed AMD agrees with a uniformly hot or a\nuniformly cold thermal state. The measured ionic column densities suggest that\nthe wind tends to the uniformly cold thermal state. The occurrence of thermal\ninstability in the warm absorber model may depend on the computational method\nand the spatial scale on which the radiative transfer is solved.\n", "  In the Kerr-Newman spacetime the Teukolsky master equation, governing the\nfundamental test fields, is of great importance. We derive an analogous master\nequation for the non-rotating C-metric which encompass massless Klein-Gordon\nfield, neutrino field, Maxwell field, Rarita-Schwinger field and gravitational\nperturbations. This equation is shown to be separable in terms of \"accelerated\nspin weighted spherical harmonics\". It is shown that, contrary to ordinary spin\nweighted spherical harmonics, the \"accelerated\" ones are different for\ndifferent spins. In some cases, the equation for eigenfunctions and eigenvalues\nare explicitly solved.\n", "  This paper serves as an introduction to the current book. It provides the\nbasic notions of long-baseline optical/infrared interferome-try prior to\nreading all the subsequent chapters, and is not an extended introduction to the\nfield.\n", "  The far field refractor problem with a discrete target is solved with a\nnumerical scheme that uses and simplify ideas from Caffarelli, Kochengin and\nOliker. A numerical implementation is carried out and examples are shown.\n", "  We discuss a new phase space method for the computation of quantum\nexpectation values in the high frequency regime. Instead of representing a\nwavefunction by its Wigner function, which typically attains negative values,\nwe define a new phase space density by adding a first-order Hermite spectrogram\nterm as a correction to the Husimi function. The new phase space density yields\naccurate approximations of the quantum expectation values as well as allows\nnumerical sampling from non-negative densities. We illustrate the new method by\nnumerical experiments in up to $128$ dimensions.\n", "  Lema\\^{i}tre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) solutions have traditionally been confined to\nsystems with no pressure in which the gravity is due to massive dust, but the\nsolutions are little changed in form if, as in cosmology, the pressure is\nuniform in space at each comoving time. This allows the equations of cosmology\nto be deduced in a manner that more closely resembles classical mechanics. It\nalso gives some inhomogeneous solutions with growing condensations and black\nholes. We give criteria by which the sizes of different closed models of the\nuniverse can be compared and discuss conditions for self-closure of\ninhomogeneous cosmologies with a $\\Lambda$-term.\n", "  Experimental evidence of superconductors with critical temperatures above\n$373\\:K$ is presented. In a family of different compounds we demonstrate the\nsuperconductor state, the transition to normal state above $387\\:K$, an\nintermediate $242\\:K$ superconductor, susceptibility up to $350\\:K$, $I-V$\ncurves at $4.2\\:K$ in magnetic field of $12\\:T$ and current up to $60\\:A$,\n$300\\:K$ Josephson Junctions and Shapiro steps with radiation of $5\\:GHz$ to\n$21\\:THz$, $300\\:K$ tapes tests with high currents up to $3000\\:A$ and many\n$THz$ images of coins and washers. Due to a pending patent, the exact chemical\ncharacterization and technological processes for these materials are\ntemporarily withheld and will be presented elsewhere.\n", "  The present work is a continuation of the previous papers written by the\nauthor on the subject. In terms of the measurability (or measurable quantities)\nnotion introduced in a minimal length theory, first the consideration is given\nto a quantum theory in the momentum representation. The same terms are used to\nconsider the Markov gravity model that here illustrates the general approach to\nstudies of gravity in terms of measurable quantities. This paper is dedicated\nto the 75th Anniversary of Professor Vladimir Grigor'evich Baryshevsky.\n", "  We use the Los Alamos VPIC code to investigate particle acceleration in\nrelativistic, unmagnetized, collisionless electron-ion plasmas. We run our\nsimulations both with a realistic proton-to-electron mass ratio m_p/m_e = 1836,\nas well as commonly employed mass ratios of m_p/m_e =100 and 25, and show that\nresults differ among the different cases. In particular, for the physically\naccurate mass ratio, electron acceleration occurs efficiently in a narrow\nregion of a few hundred inertial lengths near the flow front, producing a power\nlaw dN/dgamma ~ gamma^(-p) with p ~ -2 developing over a few decades in energy,\nwhile acceleration is weak in the region far downstream. We find 20%, 10%, and\n0.2% of the total energy given to the electrons for mass ratios of 25, 100, and\n1836 respectively at a time of 2500 (w_p)^-1. Our simulations also show\nsignificant magnetic field generation just ahead of and behind the the flow\nfront, with about 1% of the total energy going into the magnetic field for a\nmass ratio of 25 and 100, and 0.1% for a mass ratio of and 1836. In addition,\nlower mass ratios show significant fields much further downstream than in the\nrealistic mass ratio case. Our results suggest the region and energetic extent\nof particle acceleration is directly related to the presence of magnetic field\ngeneration. Our work sheds light on the understanding of particle acceleration\nand emission in gamma-ray bursts, among other relativistic astrophysical\noutflows, but also underscores the necessity of optimizing numerical and\nphysical parameters, as well as comparing among PIC codes before firm\nconclusions are drawn from these types of simulations.\n", "  We report the first nitrogen-containing iron-pnictide superconductor ThFeAsN,\nwhich is synthesized by a solid-state reaction in an evacuated container. The\ncompound crystallizes in a ZrCuSiAs-type structure with the space group P4/nmm\nand lattice parameters a=4.0367(1) {\\AA} and c=8.5262(2) {\\AA} at 300 K. The\nelectrical resistivity and dc magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate\nsuperconductivity at 30 K for the nominally undoped ThFeAsN.\n", "  The design of the WEST (Tungsten-W Environment in Steady-state Tokamak) Ion\ncyclotron resonance heating antennas is based on a previously tested\nconjugate-T Resonant Double Loops prototype equipped with internal vacuum\nmatching capacitors. The design and construction of three new WEST ICRH\nantennas are being carried out in close collaboration with ASIPP, within the\nframework of the Associated Laboratory in the fusion field between IRFM and\nASIPP. The coupling performance to the plasma and the load-tolerance have been\nimproved, while adding Continuous Wave operation capability by introducing\nwater cooling in the entire antenna. On the generator side, the operation class\nof the high power tetrodes is changed from AB to B in order to allow high power\noperation (up to 3 MW per antenna) under higher VSWR (up to 2:1). Reliability\nof the generators is also improved by increasing the cavity breakdown voltage.\nThe control and data acquisition system is also upgraded in order to resolve\nand react on fast events, such as ELMs. A new optical arc detection system\ncomes in reinforcement of the V r /V f and SHAD systems.\n", "  The electric power system is one of the cornerstones of modern society. One\nof its most serious malfunctions is the blackout, a catastrophic event that may\ndisrupt a substantial portion of the system, playing havoc to human life and\ncausing great economic losses. Thus, understanding the mechanisms leading to\nblackouts and creating a reliable and resilient power grid has been a major\nissue, attracting the attention of scientists, engineers and stakeholders. In\nthis paper, we study the blackout problem in power grids by considering a\npractical phase-oscillator model. This model allows one to simultaneously\nconsider different types of power sources (e.g., traditional AC power plants\nand renewable power sources connected by DC/AC inverters) and different types\nof loads (e.g., consumers connected to distribution networks and consumers\ndirectly connected to power plants). We propose two new control strategies\nbased on our model, one for traditional power grids, and another one for smart\ngrids. The control strategies show the efficient function of the fast-response\nenergy storage systems in preventing and predicting blackouts in smart grids.\nThis work provides innovative ideas which help us to build up a robuster and\nmore economic smart power system.\n", "  We introduce an approximate method which can be used to simulate the optical\nconductivity data of correlated multiband systems for normal and\nsuperconducting cases by taking advantage of a reverse process of a usual\noptical data analysis, which has been used to extract the electron-boson\nspectral density function from measured optical spectra of single-band systems,\nlike cuprates. We applied this method to optical conductivity data of two\nmultiband pnictide systems (Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 and LiFeAs) and obtained the\nelectron-boson spectral density functions. The obtained electron-boson spectral\ndensity consists of a sharp mode and a broad background. The obtained spectral\ndensity functions of the multiband systems show similar properties as those of\ncuprates in several aspects. We expect that our method helps to reveal the\nnature of strong correlations in the multiband pnictide superconductors.\n", "  Massive amounts of misinformation have been observed to spread in\nuncontrolled fashion across social media. Examples include rumors, hoaxes, fake\nnews, and conspiracy theories. At the same time, several journalistic\norganizations devote significant efforts to high-quality fact checking of\nonline claims. The resulting information cascades contain instances of both\naccurate and inaccurate information, unfold over multiple time scales, and\noften reach audiences of considerable size. All these factors pose challenges\nfor the study of the social dynamics of online news sharing. Here we introduce\nHoaxy, a platform for the collection, detection, and analysis of online\nmisinformation and its related fact-checking efforts. We discuss the design of\nthe platform and present a preliminary analysis of a sample of public tweets\ncontaining both fake news and fact checking. We find that, in the aggregate,\nthe sharing of fact-checking content typically lags that of misinformation by\n10--20 hours. Moreover, fake news are dominated by very active users, while\nfact checking is a more grass-roots activity. With the increasing risks\nconnected to massive online misinformation, social news observatories have the\npotential to help researchers, journalists, and the general public understand\nthe dynamics of real and fake news sharing.\n", "  Based on the single particle approximation [V. F. Dmitriev {\\it et al}, Phys.\nRev. C {\\bf50}, 2358 (1994), C.-C. Chen, Phys. Rev. A {\\bf51}, 2611 (1995)],\nthe Landau quantization associated with an atom with a magnetic quadrupole\nmoment is introduced, and then, rotating effects on this analogue of the Landau\nquantization is investigated. It is shown that rotating effects can modify the\ncyclotron frequency and breaks the degeneracy of the analogue of the Landau\nlevels.\n", "  An independent analysis of the molecular hydrogen absorption system at z =\n2.059 in the spectrum of the quasar J2123-0050 is presented. The H_2 system\nconsists of two components (A and B) with column densities log N^A(H_2) =\n17.94+/-0.01 and log N^B(H_2) = 15.16+/-0.02. The spectrum exhibits the lines\nof HD molecules (log N^A(HD) = 13.87+/-0.06) and the neutral species C I and Cl\nI associated with the H_2 absorption system. For the molecular hydrogen lines\nnear the quasar's Ly_beta and O VI emission lines, we detect a nonzero residual\nflux, ~3% of the total flux, caused by the effect of partial coverage of the\nquasar's broad-line region by an H_2 cloud. The uniqueness of the system being\ninvestigated is manifested in a high abundance of the neutral species H_2 and C\nI at the lowest H I column density, log N(H I) = 19.18+/-0.15, among the high\nredshift systems. The N(HD)/2N(H_2) ratio for component A has turned out to be\nalso unusually high, (4.26+/-0.60)x10^{-5}. We have investigated the physical\nconditions in components A and B. Component A represents the optically thick\ncase; the gas has a low number density (n~30 cm^{-3}) and a temperature T~140\nK. In component B, the medium is optically thin with n<100 cm^{-3} and T<100 K.\nThe ultraviolet (UV) background intensity in the clouds exceeds the mean\nintensity in our Galaxy by almost an order of magnitude. A high gas ionization\nfraction, n(H+)/n(H)~10^{-2}, which can be the result of partial shielding of\nthe system from hard UV radiation, is needed to describe the high HD and C I\ncolumn densities. Using our simulations with the PDR Meudon code, we can\nreconstruct the observed column densities of the species within the model with\na constant density n(H)=40 cm^{-3}. A high H_2 formation rate (higher than the\nmean Galactic value by a factor of 10-40) and high gas ionization fraction and\nUV background intensity are needed in this case.\n", "  Argon-37 is an environmental signature of an underground nuclear explosion.\nProducing and quantifying low-level Ar-37 standards is an important step in the\ndevelopment of sensitive field measurement instruments. This paper describes\nprogress at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in developing a process to\ngenerate and quantify low-level Ar-37 standards, which can be used to calibrate\nsensitive field systems at activities consistent with soil background levels.\nThis paper presents a discussion of the measurement analysis, along with\nassumptions and uncertainty estimates.\n", "  Developing high fidelity quantitative models of solid state reaction systems\ncan be challenging, especially in deposition systems where, in addition to the\nmultiple competing processes occurring simultaneously, the solid interacts with\nits atmosphere. In this work, we develop a model for the growth of a thin solid\nfilm where species from the atmosphere adsorb, diffuse, and react with the\nfilm. The model is mesoscale and describes an entire film with thickness on the\norder of microns. Because it is stochastic, the model allows us to examine\ninhomogeneities and agglomerations that would be impossible to characterize\nwith deterministic methods. We demonstrate the modeling approach with the\nexample of chalcopyrite Cu(InGa)(SeS)$_2$ thin film growth via precursor\nreaction, which is a common industrial method for fabricating thin film\nphotovoltaic modules. The model is used to understand how and why through-film\nvariation in the composition of Cu(InGa)(SeS)$_2$ thin films arises and\npersists. We believe that the model will be valuable as an effective\nquantitative description of many other materials systems used in\nsemiconductors, energy storage, and other fast-growing industries.\n", "  For $n\\in\\{2,3\\}$ we prove minimax characterisations of eigenvalues in the\ngap of the $n$ dimensional Dirac operator with an potential, which may have a\nCoulomb singularity with a coupling constant up to the critical value\n$1/(4-n)$. This result implies a so-called Hardy-Dirac inequality, which can be\nused to define a distinguished self-adjoint extension of the Coulomb-Dirac\noperator defined on\n$\\mathsf{C}_{0}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^n\\setminus\\{0\\};\\mathbb{C}^{2(n-1)})$, as\nlong as the coupling constant does not exceed $1/(4-n)$. We also find an\nexplicit description of an operator core of this operator.\n", "  Lead-based halide perovskites are emerging as the most promising class of\nmaterials for next generation optoelectronics. However, despite the enormous\nsuccess of lead-halide perovskite solar cells, the issues of stability and\ntoxicity are yet to be resolved. Here we report on the computational design and\nthe experimental synthesis of a new family of Pb-free inorganic halide\ndouble-perovskites based on bismuth or antimony and noble metals. Using\nfirst-principles calculations we show that this hitherto unknown family of\nperovskites exhibits very promising optoelectronic properties, such as tunable\nband gaps in the visible range and low carrier effective masses. Furthermore,\nwe successfully synthesize the double perovskite Cs2BiAgCl6, we perform\nstructural refinement using single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and we\ncharacterize its optical properties via optical absorption and\nphotoluminescence measurements. This new perovskite belongs to the Fm-3m space\ngroup, and consists of BiCl6 and AgCl6 octahedra alternating in a rock-salt\nface-centered cubic structure. From UV-Vis and PL measurements we obtain an\nindirect gap of 2.2 eV. The new compound is very stable under ambient\nconditions.\n", "  In this paper we present new results for the combinatorics of web diagrams\nand web worlds. These are discrete objects that arise in the physics of\ncalculating scattering amplitudes in non-abelian gauge theories. Web-colouring\nand web-mixing matrices (collectively known as web matrices) are indexed by\nordered pairs of web-diagrams and contain information relating the number of\ncolourings of the first web diagram that will produce the second diagram.\n  We introduce the black diamond product on power series and show how it\ndetermines the web-colouring matrix of disjoint web worlds. Furthermore, we\nshow that combining known physical results with the black diamond product gives\na new technique for generating combinatorial identities. Due to the complicated\naction of the product on power series, the resulting identities appear highly\nnon-trivial.\n  We present two results to explain repeated entries that appear in the web\nmatrices. The first of these shows how diagonal web matrix entries will be the\nsame if the comparability graphs of their associated decomposition posets are\nthe same. The second result concerns general repeated entries in conjunction\nwith a flipping operation on web diagrams.\n  We present a combinatorial proof of idempotency of the web-mixing matrices,\npreviously established using physical arguments only. We also show how the\nentries of the square of the web-colouring matrix can be achieved by a linear\ntransformation that maps the standard basis for formal power series in one\nvariable to a sequence of polynomials. We look at one parameterized web world\nthat is related to indecomposable permutations and show how determining the\nweb-colouring matrix entries in this case is equivalent to a combinatorics on\nwords problem.\n", "  The authors of a recent paper (Optik 125 (2014) 2022-2025) claim to have\ngrown a so called thiosemicarbazide lead nitrate (TSLN) crystal by the slow\nevaporation method. In this comment we prove that TSLN is actually\nthiosemicarbazide.\n", "  We investigate the origin and behavior of oscillations observed in the hadron\ncorrelators constructed from the domain wall fermion (DWF) for different\nparameters involved in lattice QCD simulations. This oscillatory behavior at\nearly time slices hinders the extraction of excited states in hadron\nspectroscopy. Furthermore, the deviation from exponential decay may have a\nsignificant impact on fermion loop calculations performed on the lattice. We\npresent results for several well-known implementations of the DWF actions. We\nextend the study of Shamir DWF action to include Bori\\c{c}i and M\\\"{o}bius DWF\nactions by analyzing the poles of 4D quark propagator. For each action\nconsidered, we find an unphysical mode when analyzing the pole structure of the\nfree DWF propagator for a finite extent of the $5^{\\text{th}}$ dimension $L_s$,\nand we show that this mode is responsible for the oscillatory behavior observed\nin hadron correlators. We have performed numerical checks on these results and\nhave found that the presence of oscillatory behavior is sensitive to the DWF\nparameters $a_5$, $b_5$, $c_5$ and DW height $M$. To minimize oscillations, our\nresults suggest that one should choose $M a_5<1$ for the Shamir and Bori\\c{c}i\nDWFs, and $M(b_5-c_5)<1$ for M\\\"{o}bius DWF when $M>1$. For each calculation\nconsidered, the Bor\\c{c}i DWF displayed the smallest magnitude of oscillation\nwhen compared to the Shamir and M\\\"{o}bius DWF actions using the same input\nparameters.\n", "  In this talk we elaborate on a mechanism to generate local contributions to\nthe curvature perturbation in isolated patches of the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB). The mechanism, based on the generation of an\nout-of-equilibrium configuration in fluctuating scalar fields of mass $m\\sim H$\nduring a sustained stage of fast-roll inflation, has been recently shown to be\ncapable of accounting for some of the most robust large-angle anomalies\ndetected in the CMB. In this talk, we show in detail how the embedding of the\nmechanism into models including vector fields can result in the breaking of\nstatistical isotropy in isolated patches of the CMB.\n", "  High-stress Si$_3$N$_4$ nanoresonators have become an attractive choice for\nelectro- and optomechanical devices. Membrane resonators can achieve quality\nfactor ($Q$) - frequency ($f$) products exceeding $10^{13}$ Hz, enabling (in\nprinciple) quantum coherent operation at room temperature. String-like beam\nresonators possess conventionally 10 times smaller $Q\\cdot f$ products;\nhowever, on account of their much larger $Q$-to-mass ratio and reduced mode\ndensity, they remain a canonical choice for precision force, mass, and charge\nsensing, and have recently enabled Heisenberg-limited position measurements at\ncryogenic temperatures. Here we explore two techniques to enhance the\n$Q$-factor of a nanomechanical beam. The techniques relate to two main loss\nmechanisms: internal loss, which dominates for large aspect ratios and\n$f\\lesssim100$ MHz, and radiation loss, which dominates for small aspect ratios\nand $f\\gtrsim100$ MHz. First we show that by embedding a nanobeam in a 1D\nphononic crystal, it is possible to localize its flexural motion and shield it\nagainst radiation loss. Using this method, we realize $f>100$ MHz modes with\n$Q\\sim 10^4$, consistent with internal loss and contrasting sharply with\nunshielded beams of similar dimensions. We then study the $Q\\cdot f$ products\nof high-order modes of mm-long nanobeams. Taking advantage of the mode-shape\ndependence of stress-induced `loss-dilution', we realize a $f\\approx 4$ MHz\nmode with $Q\\cdot f\\approx9\\cdot 10^{12}$ Hz. Our results can extend room\ntemperature quantum coherent operation to ultra-low-mass 1D nanomechanical\noscillators.\n", "  We quantify the thermodynamic requirement for the Vertical Shear Instability\nand evaluate its relevance to realistic protoplanetary disks as a potential\nroute to hydrodynamic turbulence.\n", "  We present a convex-concave reformulation of the reversible Markov chain\nestimation problem and outline an efficient numerical scheme for the solution\nof the resulting problem based on a primal-dual interior point method for\nmonotone variational inequalities. Extensions to situations in which\ninformation about the stationary vector is available can also be solved via the\nconvex- concave reformulation. The method can be generalized and applied to the\ndiscrete transition matrix reweighting analysis method to perform inference\nfrom independent chains with specified couplings between the stationary\nprobabilities. The proposed approach offers a significant speed-up compared to\na fixed-point iteration for a number of relevant applications.\n", "  Dynamics of Ising models is a much studied phenomenon and has emerged as a\nrich field of present-day research. An important dynamical feature commonly\nstudied is the quenching phenomenon below the critical temperature. In this\nthesis we have studied the zero temperature quenching dynamics of different\nIsing spin systems. First we have studied the zero temperature quenching\ndynamics of two dimensional Ising spin system with competating interactions.\nThen we have studied the effect of randomness or disorder on the quenching\ndynamics of Ising spin system. We have studied the effect of the nature of\nrandomness on zero temperature quenching dynamics of one dimensional Ising\nmodel on two type of complex networks. A model for opinion dynamics also has\nbeen proposed in this thesis, in which the binary opinions of the individuals\nare determined according to the size of their neighboring domains. This model\ncan be equivalently defined in terms of Ising spin variables and the various\nquantities studied have one to one correspondence with magnetic systems.\nIntroducing disorder in this model through a parameter called rigidity\nparameter $\\rho$ (probability that people are completely rigid and never change\ntheir opinion), the transition to a heterogeneous society at $\\rho = 0^{+}$ is\nobtained. The Model (Model I) has been generalized introducing a parameter\nnamed as size sensitivity parameter to modify the dynamics of the proposed\nmodel and a macroscopic crossover in time is observed for the intermediate\nvalues of this parameter.\n", "  A novel hadron calorimeter is being developed for future lepton colliding\nbeam detectors. The calorimeter is optimized for the application of Particle\nFlow Algorithms (PFAs) to the measurement of hadronic jets and features a very\nfinely segmented readout with 1 x 1 cm2 cells. The active media of the\ncalorimeter are Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) with a digital, i.e. one-bit,\nreadout. To first order the energy of incident particles in this calorimeter is\nreconstructed as being proportional to the number of pads with a signal over a\ngiven threshold. A large-scale prototype calorimeter with approximately 500,000\nreadout channels has been built and underwent extensive testing in the Fermilab\nand CERN test beams. This paper reports on the design, construction, and\ncommissioning of the electronic readout system of this prototype calorimeter.\nThe system is based on the DCAL front-end chip and a VME-based back-end.\n", "  The feature based spatial verification method SAL is applied to cloud data,\ni.e. two-dimensional spatial fields of total cloud cover and spectral radiance.\nModel output is obtained from the COSMO-DE forward operator SynSat and compared\nto SEVIRI satellite data. The aim of this study is twofold. First, to assess\nthe applicability of SAL to this kind of data, and second, to analyze the role\nof external object identification algorithms (OIA) and the effects of\nobservational uncertainties on the resulting scores.\n  As a feature based method, SAL requires external OIA. A comparison of three\ndifferent algorithms shows that the threshold level, which is a fundamental\npart of all studied algorithms, induces high sensitivity and unstable behavior\nof object dependent SAL scores (i.e. even very small changes in parameter\nvalues can lead to large changes in the resulting scores). An in-depth\nstatistical analysis reveals significant effects on distributional quantities\ncommonly used in the interpretation of SAL, e.g. median and interquartile\ndistance. Two sensitivity indicators based on the univariate cumulative\ndistribution functions are derived. They allow to asses the sensitivity of the\nSAL scores to threshold level changes without computationally expensive\niterative calculations of SAL for various thresholds. The mathematical\nstructure of these indicators connects the sensitivity of the SAL scores to\nparameter changes with the effect of observational uncertainties.\n  Finally, the discriminating power of SAL is studied. It is shown, that - for\nlarge-scale cloud data - changes in the parameters may have larger effects on\nthe object dependent SAL scores (i.e. the S and L2 scores) than a complete loss\nof temporal collocation.\n", "  The standard transition state theory (TST) of bimolecular reactions was\nrecently shown to lead to a rate law in disagreement with the expected second\norder rate law [Bonnet L., Rayez J.-C. Int. J. Quantum Chem. 2010, 110, 2355].\nAn alternative derivation was proposed which allows to overcome this paradox.\nThis derivation allows to get at the same time the good rate law and Eyring\nequation for the rate constant. The purpose of this paper is to provide\nrigorous and convincing theoretical arguments in order to strengthen these\ndevelopments and improve their visibility.\n", "  We present a two-step technique for the synthesis of superconducting\nCuxBi2Se3. Cu0.15Bi2Se3 single crystals were synthesized using the melt-growth\nmethod. Although these samples are non-superconducting, they can be employed to\ngenerate high quality superconducting samples if used as precursors in the\nfollowing electrochemical synthesis step. Samples made from Cu0.15Bi2Se3\nreliably exhibit zero-resistance even under the non-optimal quenching\ncondition, while samples made from pristine Bi2Se3 require fine tuning of the\nquenching conditions to achieve similar performance. Moreover, under the\noptimal quenching condition, the average superconducting shielding fraction was\nstill lower in the samples made from pristine Bi2Se3 than in the samples made\nfrom Cu0.15Bi2Se3. These results suggest that the pre-doped Cu atoms facilitate\nthe formation of a superconducting percolation network. We also discuss the\nuseful clues that we gathered about the locations of Cu dopants that are\nresponsible for superconductivity.\n", "  We study the equations of motion for a barotropic fluid in spherical\nsymmetric flow. Making use of the Riemann invariants we consider the\ncharacteristic form of these equations. In a first part, we show that the\nresulting constraint equations along characteristics can be solved globally\naway from the center of symmetry. In a second part, given data on two\nintersecting characteristics, we show existence and uniqueness of a smooth\nsolution in a neighborhood in the future of these characteristics.\n", "  An attempt at understanding downward overshooting in the convective envelopes\nof post-main-sequence stars has been made on the basis of three-dimensional\nlarge-eddy simulations, using artificially modified OPAL opacity and taking\ninto account radiation and ionization in the equation of state. Two types of\nstar, an intermediate-mass star and a massive star, were considered. To avoid a\nlong thermal relaxation time of the intermediate-mass star, we increased the\nstellar energy flux artificially while trying to maintain a structure close to\nthe one given by a 1D stellar model. A parametric study of the flux factor was\nperformed. For the massive star, no such process was necessary. Numerical\nresults were analysed when the system reached the statistical steady state. It\nwas shown that the penetration distance in pressure scaleheights is of the\norder of unity. The scaling relations between penetration distance, input flux\nand vertical velocity fluctuations studied by Singh et al. were checked. The\nanisotropy of the turbulent convection and the diffusion models of the\nthird-order moments representing the non-local transport were also\ninvestigated. These models are dramatically affected by the velocity fields and\nno universal constant parameters seem to exist. The limitations of the\nnumerical results were also discussed.\n", "  We show that, at low inertia and large elasticity, shell models of\nviscoelastic fluids develop a chaotic behaviour with properties similar to\nthose of elastic turbulence. The low dimensionality of shell models allows us\nto explore a wide range both in polymer concentration and in Weissenberg\nnumber. Our results demonstrate that the physical mechanisms at the origin of\nelastic turbulence do not rely on the boundary conditions or on the geometry of\nthe mean flow.\n", "  The vast majority of the pulsars detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope\n(LAT) display spectra with exponential cutoffs falling in a narrow range around\na few GeV. Early spectral modelling predicted spectral cutoff energies of up to\n100 GeV. More modern studies estimated spectral cutoff energies in the 1-20 GeV\nrange. It was therefore not expected that pulsars would be visible in the\nvery-high-energy (VHE; >100 GeV) regime. The VERITAS detection (confirmed by\nMAGIC) of pulsed emission from the Crab pulsar up to 400 GeV (and now possibly\nup to 1 TeV) therefore raised important questions about our understanding of\nthe electrodynamics and local environment of pulsars. H.E.S.S. has now detected\npulsed emission from the Vela pulsar in the 20-120 GeV range, making this the\nsecond pulsar detected by a ground-based Cherenkov telescope. We will review\nthe latest developments in VHE pulsar science, including an overview of recent\nobservations and refinements to radiation models and magnetic field structures.\nThis will assist us in interpreting the VHE emission detected from the Crab and\nVela pulsars, and predicting the level of VHE emission expected from other\npulsars, which will be very important for the upcoming CTA.\n", "  We study arbitrary order symmetry operators for the linear Schr\\\"odinger\nequations with arbitrary number of spatial variables. We deduce determining\nequations for coefficient functions of such operators and consider in detail\nsome cases when these equations can be explicitly solved. In addition, the\ncomplete group classification of the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation is\npresented.\n", "  We report extremely large positive magnetoresistance of 1.72 million percent\nin single crystal TaSb$_{2}$ at moderate conditions of 1.5 K and 15 T. The\nquadratic growth of magnetoresistance (MR $\\propto\\,B^{1.96}$) is not\nsaturating up to 15 T, a manifestation of nearly perfect compensation with\n$<0.1\\%$ mismatch between electron and hole pockets in this semimetal. The\ncompensation mechanism is confirmed by temperature-dependent MR, Hall and\nthermoelectric coefficients of Nernst and Seebeck, revealing two pronounced\nFermi surface reconstruction processes without spontaneous symmetry breaking,\n\\textit{i.e.} Lifshitz transitions, at around 20 K and 60 K, respectively.\nUsing quantum oscillations of magnetoresistance and magnetic susceptibility,\nsupported by density-functional theory calculations, we determined that the\nmain hole Fermi surface of TaSb$_{2}$ forms a unique shoulder structure along\nthe $F-L$ line. The flat band top of this shoulder pocket is just a few meV\nabove the Fermi level, leading to the observed topological phase transition at\n20 K when the shoulder pocket disappears. Further increase in temperature\npushes the Fermi level to the band top of the main hole pocket, induced the\nsecond Lifshitz transition at 60 K when hole pocket vanishes completely.\n", "  A new parametrization of the multi-channel S-matrix is used to fit scattering\ndata and then to locate the resonances as its poles. The S-matrix is written in\nterms of the corresponding \"in\" and \"out\" Jost matrices which are expanded in\nthe Taylor series of the collision energy E around an appropriately chosen\nenergy E0. In order to do this, the Jost matrices are written in a\nsemi-analytic form where all the factors (involving the channel momenta and\nSommerfeld parameters) responsible for their \"bad behaviour\" (i.e. responsible\nfor the multi-valuedness of the Jost matrices and for branching of the Riemann\nsurface of the energy) are given explicitly. The remaining unknown factors in\nthe Jost matrices are analytic and single-valued functions of the variable E\nand are defined on a simple energy plane. The expansion is done for these\nanalytic functions and the expansion coefficients are used as the fitting\nparameters. The method is tested on a two-channel model, using a set of\nartificially generated data points with typical error bars and a typical random\nnoise in the positions of the points.\n", "  In this paper, we mainly study the local indistinguishability of multipartite\nproduct states. Firstly, we follow the method of Z.-C. Zhang \\emph{et al}[Phys.\nRev. A 93, 012314(2016)] to give another more concise set of $2n-1$ orthogonal\nproduct states in $\\mathbb{C}^m\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^n(4\\leq m\\leq n)$ which can\nnot be distinguished by local operations and classical communication(LOCC).\nThen we use the 3 dimension cubes to present some product states which give us\nan intuitive view how to construct locally indistinguishable product states in\ntripartite quantum system. At last, we give an explicit construction of locally\nindistinguishable orthogonal product states for general multipartite system.\n", "  The dynamics of nanomechanical resonators driven by both low- and\nhigh-frequency signals is studied. Considering, as an example, resonators made\nof a doubly-clamped beam with magnetomotive driving, it is shown that\nthree-frequency resonances arise due to the interaction of the above\nfrequencies. Properties and characteristics of these resonances are determined\nanalytically for linear and nonlinear modes of the resonator excitation. It is\nshown that in opposite to the conventional two-frequency resonance, the central\nfrequency of these resonances, their linear dynamic range, and the critical\nvalue for the bistability onset are easily controlled by changing the frequency\nand the amplitude of the low-frequency driving current. The obtained results\ncan be used when developing NMRs for sensors, filters, memory elements, and\nother applications.\n", "  We report on the study of terahertz radiation induced MIRO-like oscillations\nof magneto-resistivity in GaAs heterostructures. Our experiments provide an\nanswer on two most intriguing questions - effect of radiation helicity and the\nrole of the edges - yielding crucial information for understanding of the MIRO\norigin. Moreover, we demonstrate that the range of materials exhibiting\nradiation-induced magneto-oscillations can be largely extended by using\nhigh-frequency radiation.\n", "  We propose a simple gauged U(1)$_{B-L}$ extension of the minimal\nsupersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), where R-parity is conserved as usual in\nthe MSSM. The global $B-L$ (baryon number minus lepton number) symmetry in the\nMSSM is gauged and three MSSM gauge-singlet chiral multiplets with a unit $B-L$\ncharge are introduced, ensuring the model free from gauge and gravitational\nanomalies. We assign an odd R-parity for two of the new chiral multiplets and\nhence they are identified with the right-handed neutrino superfields, while an\neven R-parity is assigned to the other one ($\\Phi$). The scalar component of\n$\\Phi$ plays the role of a Higgs field to break the U(1)$_{B-L}$ symmetry\nthrough its negative mass squared, which is radiatively generated by the\nrenormalization group running of soft supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking parameters\nfrom a high energy. This radiative U(1)$_{B-L}$ symmetry breaking leads to its\nbreaking scale being at the TeV naturally. Because of our novel R-parity\nassignment, three light neutrinos are Dirac particles with one massless state.\nSince R-parity is conserved, the lightest neutralino is a prime candidate of\nthe dark matter as usual. In our model, the lightest eigenstate of the mixture\nof the $B-L$ gaugino and the fermionic component of $\\Phi$ appears as a new\ndark matter candidate. We investigate phenomenology of this dark matter\nparticle. We also discuss collider phenomenology of our model. In particular,\nthe $B-L$ gauge boson ($Z'$), once discovered at the Large Hadron Collider, can\nbe a probe to determine the number of (right-handed) Dirac neutrinos with its\ninvisible decay width, in sharp contrast with the conventional $B-L$ extension\nof the SM or MSSM where the right-handed neutrinos are heavy Majorana particles\nand decay to the SM leptons.\n", "  Nonsingular disclination dynamics in a uniaxial nematic liquid crystal is\nmodeled within a mathematical framework where the kinematics is a direct\nextension of the classical way of identifying these line defects with\nsingularities of a unit vector field representing the nematic director. It is\nwell known that the universally accepted Oseen-Frank energy is infinite for\nconfigurations that contain disclination line defects. We devise a natural\naugmentation of the Oseen-Frank energy to account for physical situations\nwhere, under certain conditions, infinite director gradients have zero\nassociated energy cost, as would be necessary for modeling half-integer\nstrength disclinations within the framework of the director theory. Equilibria\nand dynamics (in the absence of flow) of line defects are studied within the\nproposed model. Using appropriate initial/boundary data, the gradient-flow\ndynamics of this energy leads to non-singular, line defect equilibrium\nsolutions, including those of half-integer strength. However, we demonstrate\nthat the gradient flow dynamics for this energy is not able to adequately\ndescribe defect evolution. Motivated by similarity with dislocation dynamics in\nsolids, a novel 2D-model of disclination dynamics in nematics is proposed. The\nmodel is based on the extended Oseen-Frank energy and takes into account\nthermodynamics and the kinematics of conservation of defect topological charge.\nWe validate this model through computations of disclination equilibria,\nannihilation, repulsion, and splitting. We show that the energy function we\ndevise, suitably interpreted, can serve as well for the modeling of equilibria\nand dynamics of dislocation line defects in solids making the conclusions of\nthis paper relevant to mechanics of both solids and liquid crystals.\n", "  The aim of this study is to find universal critical values of the\ndimensionless effective coupling constant $g_6$ and refined universal values\n$g_4$ for Heisenberg ferromagnets with $n$-component order parameters. These\nconstants appear in the equation of state and determine the nonlinear\nsusceptibilities $\\chi_4$ and $\\chi_6$ in the critical region. The sextic\ncoupling $g_6$ is calculated as a function of $g_4$ in the three-loop\napproximation, the series obtained is resummed by the Pade-Borel method and\nthen by substituting the Wilson fixed point coordinate $g_4^*$ into resultant\nexpression numerical values of $g_6^*$ are obtained for different $n$. The\nnumbers $g_4^*$ were determined from the six-loop expansions for $\\beta$\nfunction resummed using Borel-transformation-based techniques. The analysis of\nthe accuracy of these $g_6^*$ values showed that they differ from the true\nvalues by no more than 1.6 %. The values of $g_6^*$ thus found were compared\nalso with those given by the $1/n$ method what allowed to estimate the level of\naccuracy of this method.\n", "  By means of first-principles calculations, we explore systematically the\ngeometric, electronic and piezoelectric properties of multilayer SnSe. We find\nthat these properties are layer-dependent, indicating that the interlayer\ninteraction plays an important role. With increasing the number of SnSe layers\nfrom 1 to 6, we observe that the lattice constant decreases from 4.27\n$\\mathring{A}$ to 4.22 $\\mathring{A}$ along zigzag direction, and increases\nfrom 4.41 $\\mathring{A}$ to 4.51 $\\mathring{A}$ along armchair direction close\nto the bulk limit (4.21 $\\mathring{A}$ and 4.52 $\\mathring{A}$, respectively);\nthe band gap decreases from 1.45 eV to 1.08 eV, approaching the bulk gap 0.95\neV. Although the monolayer SnSe exhibits almost symmetric geometric and\nelectronic structures along zigzag and armchair directions, bulk SnSe is\nobviously anisotropic, showing that the stacking of layers enhances the\nanisotropic character of SnSe. As bulk and even-layer SnSe have inversion\ncenters, they cannot exhibit piezoelectric responses. However, we show that the\nodd-layer SnSe have piezoelectric coefficients much higher than those of the\nknown piezoelectric materials, suggesting that the odd-layer SnSe is a good\npiezoelectric material.\n", "  The photoluminescence (PL) and absorption experiments have been performed in\nGaSe slab with incident light polarized perpendicular to c-axis of sample at\n10K. An obvious energy difference of about 34meV between exciton absorption\npeak and PL peak (the highest energy peak) is observed. By studying the\ntemperature dependence of PL spectra, we attribute it to energy difference\nbetween free exciton and bound exciton states, where main exciton absorption\npeak comes from free exciton absorption, and PL peak are attributed to\nrecombination of bound exciton at 10K. This strong bound exciton effect is\nstable up to 50K. Moreover, the temperature dependence of integrated PL\nintensity and PL lifetime reveals that a non-radiative process, with active\nenergy extracted as 0.5meV, dominates PL emission.\n", "  In the present paper I argue that the formalism of Newtonian mechanics stems\ndirectly from the general principle to be called the principle of microlevel\nreducibility which physical systems obey in the realm of classical physics.\nThis principle assumes, first, that all the properties of physical systems must\nbe determined by their states at the current moment of time, in a slogan form\nit is \"only the present matters to physics.\" Second, it postulates that any\nphysical system is nothing but an ensemble of structureless particles arranged\nin some whose interaction obeys the superposition principle. I substantiate\nthis statement and demonstrate directly how the formalism of differential\nequations, the notion of forces in Newtonian mechanics, the concept of phase\nspace and initial conditions, the principle of least actions, etc. result from\nthe principle of microlevel reducibility. The philosophical concept of thick\npresentism and the introduction of two dimensional time---physical time and\nmeta-time that are mutually independent on infinitesimal scales---are the the\npivot points in these constructions.\n", "  We discuss the response of thin cylindrical tubes to small indentations. The\nstretching-free embedding of these surfaces is completely determined by the\nembedding of one edge curve, thus reducing their bending response to an\neffectively one dimensional problem. We obtain that in general thin cylindrical\ntubes will bend non-uniformly in response to an indentation normal to their\nsurface. As a consequence, their local bending stiffness, as measured by\nindenting at various locations along their axis, is predicted to peak at the\ncenter and decrease by a universal factor of 4 at either end of the tube. This\ncharacteristic spatial profile of the bending stiffness variation allows a\ndirect determination of the bending modulus of very thin tubes that are shorter\nthan their pinch persistence length, $l_{p}\\propto R^{3/2}/t^{1/2}$, where $R$\nis the tube diameter and $t$ its wall thickness. We compare our results with\nexperiments performed on rolled-up stainless steel sheets.\n", "  We study two different one-parameter generalizations of\nLittlewood--Richardson coefficients, namely Hall polynomials and generalized\ninverse Kostka polynomials, and derive new combinatorial formulae for them. Our\ncombinatorial expressions are closely related to puzzles, originally introduced\nby Knutson and Tao in their work on the equivariant cohomology of the\nGrassmannian.\n", "  Recently, a new class of codes, called sparse superposition or sparse\nregression codes, has been proposed for communication over the AWGN channel. It\nhas been proven that they achieve capacity using power allocation and various\nforms of iterative decoding. Empirical evidence has also strongly suggested\nthat the codes achieve capacity when spatial coupling and approximate message\npassing decoding are used, without need of power allocation. In this note we\nprove that state evolution (which tracks message passing) indeed saturates the\npotential threshold of the underlying code ensemble, which approaches in a\nproper limit the optimal threshold. Our proof uses ideas developed in the\ntheory of low-density parity-check codes and compressive sensing.\n", "  We construct wormhole-like solutions in the type IIA string theory. These\nsolutions represent wormholes in four-dimensions and are given by the D2 branes\nwithin appropraited backgrounds fields. We present the conditions on these\nfields which lead to the four-dimensional wormholes. In the special case we\nshow how the particular solution in the type IIA theory leads to the dynamic\nwormhole. We also speculate about the number of universes and the cosmological\nconstant.\n", "  The Large Area Picosecond PhotoDetector (LAPPD) Collaboration was formed in\n2009 to develop large-area photodetectors capable of time resolutions measured\nin pico-seconds, with accompanying sub-millimeter spatial resolution. During\nthe next three and one-half years the Collaboration developed the LAPPD design\nof 20 x 20 cm modules with gains greater than $10^7$ and non-uniformity less\nthan $15\\%$, time resolution less than 50 psec for single photons and spatial\nresolution of 700~microns in both lateral dimensions. We describe the R\\&D\nperformed to develop large-area micro-channel plate glass substrates, resistive\nand secondary-emitting coatings, large-area bialkali photocathodes, and\nRF-capable hermetic packaging. In addition, the Collaboration developed the\nnecessary electronics for large systems capable of precise timing, built up\nfrom a custom low-power 15-GigaSample/sec waveform sampling 6-channel\nintegrated circuit and supported by a two-level modular data acquisition system\nbased on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays for local control, data-sparcification,\nand triggering. We discuss the formation, organization, and technical successes\nand short-comings of the Collaboration. The Collaboration ended in December\n2012 with a transition from R\\&D to commercialization.\n", "  We consider a system of urns of Polya-type, with balls of two colors; the\nreinforcement of each urn depends both on the content of the same urn and on\nthe average content of all urns. We show that the urns synchronize almost\nsurely, in the sense that the fraction of balls of a given color converges\nalmost surely, as the time goes to infinity, to the same limit for all urns. A\nnormal approximation for a large number of urns is also obtained.\n", "  We give a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an\nincreasing coupling of $N$ ($N \\geq 2$) synchronous dynamics on $S^{\\mathbb\nZ^d}$(PCA). Increasing means the coupling preserves stochastic ordering. We\nfirst present our main construction theorem in the case where $S$ is totally\nordered, applications to attractive PCA's are given. When $S$ is only partially\nordered, we show on two examples that a coupling of more than two synchronous\ndynamics may not exist. We also prove an extension of our main result for a\nparticular class of partially ordered spaces.\n", "  In this paper we consider the problem of characterizing the minimum energy\nconfigurations of a finite system of particles interacting between them due to\nattracting or repulsive forces given by a certain inter molecular potential. We\nlimit ourselves to the cases of three particles arranged in a triangular array\nand that of four particles in a tetrahedral array. The minimization is\nconstrained to fixed area in the case of the triangular array, and to fixed\nvolume in the tetrahedral case. For a general class of inter molecular\npotentials we give conditions for the homogeneous configuration (either an\nequilateral triangle or a regular tetrahedron) of the array to be stable, that\nis, a minimizer of the potential energy of the system. To determine whether or\nnot there exist other stable states, the system of first order necessary\nconditions for a minimum is treated as a bifurcation problem with the area or\nvolume variable as the bifurcation parameter. Because of the symmetries present\nin our problem, we can apply the techniques of equivariant bifurcation theory\nto show that there exist branches of non--homogeneous solutions bifurcating\nfrom the trivial branch of homogeneous solutions at precisely the values of the\nparameter of area or volume for which the homogeneous configuration changes\nstability. For the triangular array, we construct numerically the bifurcation\ndiagrams for both a Lennard--Jones and Buckingham potentials. The numerics show\nthat there exist non--homogeneous stable states, multiple stable states for\nintervals of values of the area parameter, and secondary bifurcations as well.\n", "  The power electronic interface to a vibration energy harvester not only\nprovides ac-dc conversion, but can also set the electrical damping to maximize\noutput power under displacement-constrained operation. This is commonly\nexploited for linear two-port harvesters by synchronous switching to realize a\nCoulomb-damped resonant generator, but has not been fully explored when the\nharvester is asynchronously switched to emulate a resistive load. In order to\nunderstand the potential of such an approach, the optimal values of load\nresistance and other control parameters need to be known. In this paper we\ndetermine analytically the optimal load and stiffness of a harmonically driven\ntwo-port harvester with displacement constraints. For weak-coupling devices, we\ndo not find any benefit of load and stiffness adjustment beyond maintaining a\nsaturated power level. For strong coupling we find that the power can be\noptimized to agree with the velocity damped generator beyond the first critical\nforce for displacement-constrained operation. This can be sustained up to a\nsecond critical force, determined by a resonator figure-of-merit, at which the\npower ultimately levels out.\n", "  Vector meson production in ultra-peripheral pA and AA collisions at the CERN\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC) are very sensitive to Parton Distribution Functions\n(PDF) as well as to their leading-order, next-to-leading-order, and medium\ncorrections. This process is a complimentary tool to explore the effects of\ndifferent PDFs in particle production in proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus\ncentral collisions. Existing and forthcoming data available, e.g., from ALICE\nand CMS, may be used in conjunction with our theoretical predictions to\nconstrain the PDFs. We make predictions for rapidity distributions and for\ncross sections of J/$\\psi$ , $\\psi(2S)$ and $\\Upsilon$ production at\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV and $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5$ TeV. We use the second energy as\nrepresentative for the Run 2 of PbPb collisions at the LHC.\n", "  In this paper a role of many-nucleon dynamics in formation of the compound\n$^{5}{\\rm Li}$ nucleus in the scattering of protons off $\\alpha$-particles at\nthe proton incident energies up to 20 MeV is investigated. We propose a\nbremsstrahlung model allowing to extract information about probabilities of\nformation of such nucleus on the basis of analysis of experimental\ncross-sections of the bremsstrahlung photons. In order to realize this\napproach, the model includes elements of microscopic theory and also\nprobabilities of formation of the short-lived compound nucleus. Results of\ncalculations of the bremsstrahlung spectra are in good agreement with the\nexperimental cross-sections.\n", "  High resolution optical endoscopes are increasingly used in diagnosis of\nvarious medical conditions of internal organs, such as the gastrointestinal\ntracts, but they are too expensive for use in resource-poor settings. On the\nother hand, smartphones with high resolution cameras and Internet access have\nbecome more affordable, enabling them to diffuse into most rural areas and\ndeveloping countries in the past decade. In this letter we describe a\nsmartphone microendoscope that can take fluorescence images with a spatial\nresolution of 3.1 {\\mu}m. Images collected from ex vivo, in vitro and in vivo\nsamples using the device are also presented. The compact and cost-effective\nsmartphone microendoscope may be envisaged as a powerful tool for detecting\npre-cancerous lesions of internal organs in low and middle income countries.\n", "  Wildlife corridors are components of landscapes, which facilitate the\nmovement of organisms and processes between areas of intact habitat, and thus\nprovide landscape corridor. Corridors are thus regions within a given landscape\nthat generally comprise native vegetation, and connect otherwise fragmented,\ndisconnected, non-contiguous wildlife habitat patches in the landscape. The\npurpose of designing corridors as a conservation strategy is primarily to\ncounter, and to the extent possible, mitigate the impacts of habitat\nfragmentation and loss on the biodiversity of the landscape, as well as support\ncontinuance of land use for essential local and global economic activities in\nthe region of reference. In this paper, we use game theory and graph theory to\nmodel and design a wildlife corridor network in the Central India Eastern Ghats\nlandscape complex, with tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) as the focal species. We\nconstruct a graph using the habitat patches supporting wild tiger populations\nin the landscape complex as vertices and the possible paths between these\nvertices as edges. A cost matrix is constructed to indicate the cost incurred\nby the tiger for passage between the habitat patches in the landscape, by\nmodelling a two-person Prisoners Dilemma game. A minimum spanning tree is then\nobtained by employing Kruskals algorithm, which would suggest a feasible tiger\ncorridor network for the tiger population within the landscape complex.\nAdditionally, analysis of the graph is done using various centrality measures,\nin order to identify and focus on potentially important habitat patches, and\ntheir potential community structure. Correlation analysis is performed on the\ncentrality indices to draw out interesting trends in the network.\n", "  Recently, presence of hidden singularities known as exceptional points (EPs)\nin non-Hermitian quantum systems has opened up a tremendous interest in\ndifferent domains of physics owing to their unique unconventional physical\neffects. Effectively for such systems an EP appears as a fascinating\ntopological defect where two mutually interacting eigenstates of the system\ncoalesce. In this work, we report occurrence of EP via avoided crossing between\ncoupled resonance states in an optical microcavity with spatially varying gain\nloss profile, an optical analogue of non-Hermitian system. With suitably\ntailored system openness and coupling strength, internally coupled resonances\ncan exhibit EP in a medium with simultaneous presence of loss and gain. We\nexplore the characteristics behaviors of energy eigenvalues in complex energy\nplane and corresponding eigenstates when the control parameters of the system\nare adiabatically changed, such a way that they encircle the EP. In this\nletter, we first ever exploit the above scheme to analyze the optical\nperformance in terms of stability and rigidity of a microcavity simultaneously\nhosting such multiple EPs.\n", "  The discrete autonomous/non-autonomous Toda equations and the discrete\nLotka-Volterra system are important integrable discrete systems in fields such\nas mathematical physics, mathematical biology and statistical physics. They\nalso have applications to numerical linear algebra. In this paper, we first\nsimultaneously obtain their general solutions. Then, we show the asymptotic\nbehavior of the solutions for any initial values as the discrete-time variables\ngo to infinity. Our two main techniques for understanding the distinct\nintegrable systems are to introduce two types of discrete-time variables and to\nexamine properties of a restricted infinite sequence, its associated\ndeterminants and polynomials.\n", "  We report on the design, fabrication and measurement of travelling-wave\nsuperconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) integrated with\npolycrystalline diamond photonic circuits. We analyze their performance both in\nthe near-infrared wavelength regime around 1600 nm and at 765 nm. Near-IR\ndetection is important for compatibility with the telecommunication\ninfrastructure, while operation in the visible wavelength range is relevant for\ncompatibility with the emission line of silicon vacancy centers in diamond\nwhich can be used as efficient single-photon sources. Our detectors feature\nhigh critical currents (up to 31 {\\mu}A) and high performance in terms of\nefficiency (up to 74% at 765 nm), noise-equivalent power (down to 4.4*10^-19\nW/(Hz^1/2) at 765 nm) and timing jitter (down to 23 ps).\n", "  Tidal streams from existing and destroyed satellite galaxies populate the\nouter regions of the Andromeda galaxy (M31). This inhomogeneous debris can be\nstudied without many of the obstacles that plague Milky Way research. We review\nthe history of tidal stream research in M31, and in its main satellite\ngalaxies. We highlight the numerous tidal streams observed around M31, some of\nwhich reside at projected distances of up to 120 kpc from the center of this\ngalaxy. Most notable is the Giant Stellar Stream, a signature of the most\nrecent significant accretion event in the M31 system. This event involved an\nearly-type progenitor of ~10^9 solar masses that came within a few kpc of M31's\ncenter roughly a gigayear ago; almost all of the inner halo debris (within 50\nkpc) in M31 can be tied either directly or indirectly to this event. We draw\nattention to the fact that most of M31's outer halo globular clusters lie\npreferentially on tidal streams and discuss the potential this offers to use\nthese systems as probes of the accretion history. Tidal features observed\naround M33, M32, NGC 205 and NGC 147 are also reviewed. We conclude by\ndiscussing future prospects for this field.\n", "  A new first-principles statistical mechanics formulation is proposed to\ndescribe slow and dilated granular fluids, where prolonged intergranular\ncontacts vitiate collision theory. The contacts, where all the important\nphysics takes place, are regarded as quasi-particles that can appear and\ndisappear. A contact potential, $\\nu$, is defined as a measure of the\nfluctuations and the mean coordination number per particle and its fluctuations\nare calculated as a function of it. This formulation extends the Edwards\nstatistical mechanics to slow dynamic systems and converges to it when the\nmotion stops. The theory is applied to a model system of a simply sheared\ngranular material in the limit of small confining stress. The dependence of the\ncontact potential on the shear rate is derived, making it possible to calibrate\n$\\nu$ experimentally and predict the coordination number distribution as a\nfunction of the shear rate. Setting next $\\nu=0$ as the jamming point, where\nthe critical mean coordination number is $z_c$, a finite value is found for the\nshear rate there, $\\dot{\\gamma}_c$. A simple mean field theory then yields the\nscaling of the mean coordination number and its fluctuations near\n$\\dot{\\gamma}_c$. Existing results in the literature appear to support the\npredictions.\n", "  We report Monte Carlo results for the fluid structure of a system of dimeric\nparticles interacting via a core-softened potential. More specifically, dimers\ninteract through a repulsive pair potential of inverse-power form, modified in\nsuch a way that the repulsion strength is softened in a given range of\ndistances. The aim of such a study is to investigate how both the elongation of\nthe dimers and the softness of the potential affect some features of the model.\nOur results show that the dimeric fluid exhibits both density and structural\nanomalies even if the interaction is not characterized by two length scales.\nUpon increasing the aspect ratio of the dimers, such anomalies are\nprogressively hindered, with the structural anomaly surviving even after the\ndisappearance of the density anomaly. These results shed light on the peculiar\nbehaviour of molecular systems of non-spherical shape, showing how geometrical\nand interaction parameters play a fundamental role for the presence of\nanomalies.\n", "  This chapter summarizes radio astrometry in relation to current very long\nbaseline interferometry (VLBI) projects and describes its perspectives with the\nSKA. The scientific goals of the astrometry with the SKA have been discussed in\nthe international and Japanese communities of researchers, whose major issues\nare shown here. We have demonstrated some of the issues, such as censuses of\npossible targets and the technical feasibility of astrometry in the SKA\nfrequency bands. The preliminary results of our case studies on SKA astrometry\nare also presented. In addition, possible synergy and commensality of the SKA\nastrometric projects with those in the optical and infrared astrometric\nmissions, especially JASMINE (Japan Astrometry Satellite Mission for INfrared\nExploration) are discussed.\n", "  We briefly discuss the possibility to describe with a formalism, analogous to\nthe Bragg law and the transfer matrix method used for photonic crystals, the\nbehaviour of the kinetic energy of an object travelling through a\none-dimensional (1D) modulation of the gravitational interaction, i.e. a 1D\ngravitational crystal. We speculate that certain ranges of the kinetic energy\nof an object with mass m and speed v cannot travel through the crystal, giving\nrise to a gravitational gap.\n", "  We investigate nematic states in both bulk FeSe and FeSe thin films. It is\nfound that their band structures and signature features that were observed in a\nvariety of experiments can be perfectly explained by introducing the $d$-wave\nnematic orders that are required to have contributions from all $t_{2g}$\nd-orbitals, which contradicts the conventional wisdom that the nematicity is\nsimply driven by the orbital degeneracy between the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$\norbitals. These orders can be generated by the Coulomb interaction between the\nnearest neighbor Fe sites. In the presence of spin-orbital couplings, we\npredict that the nematic order can drive a topological quantum phase transition\nthrough a band inversion at the $M$ point of the Brillouin zone to produce\ntopologically protected edge states near the Fermi level. The prediction makes\nFeSe as a tunable system to integrate topological properties into high\ntemperature superconductivity to realize Majorana related physics.\n", "  The formalism based on Correlated Basis Functions (CBF) and the\ncluster-expansion technique has been recently employed to derive an effective\ninteraction from a realistic nuclear Hamiltonian. One of the main objectives of\nthe work described in this Thesis is establishing the accuracy of this novel\napproach--that allows to combine the flexibility of perturbation theory in the\nbasis of eigenstates of the noninteracting system with a realistic description\nof short-range correlations in coordinate space--by focusing on the hard-sphere\nfermion system.\n  As a first application of the formalism, the quasiparticle properties of hard\nspheres of degeneracy four have been determined from the two-point Green's\nfunction. The calculation has been performed carrying out a perturbative\nexpansion of the self-energy, up to the second order in the CBF effective\ninteraction. The main results of this study are the momentum distributions, the\nquasiparticle spectra and their description in terms of effective mass.\n  The investigation of the hard-sphere fermion fluid has been extended to study\nthe shear viscosity and thermal conductivity coefficients of the system with\ndegeneracy two, that can be regarded as a model of pure neutron matter. The\nresulting transport coefficients show a strong sensitivity to the quasiparticle\neffective mass, reflecting the effect of second order contributions to the\nself-energy which are not taken into account in nuclear matter studies\navailable in the literature. The difference between first and second order\nresults is likely to play an important role in astrophysical applications and\nneeds to be carefully investigated extending our analysis to nuclear matter.\n", "  High-quality materials are critical for advances in plasmonics, especially as\nresearchers now investigate quantum effects at the limit of single surface\nplasmons or exploit ultraviolet- or CMOS-compatible metals such as aluminum or\ncopper. Unfortunately, due to inexperience with deposition methods, many\nplasmonics researchers deposit metals under the wrong conditions, severely\nlimiting performance unnecessarily. This is then compounded as others follow\ntheir published procedures. In this perspective, we describe simple rules\ncollected from the surface-science literature that allow high-quality plasmonic\nfilms of aluminum, copper, gold, and silver to be easily deposited with\ncommonly available equipment (a thermal evaporator). Recipes are also provided\nso that films with optimal optical properties can be routinely obtained.\n", "  We present a model of Selinger and Valiron's quantum lambda calculus based on\nvon Neumann algebras, and show that the model is adequate with respect to the\noperational semantics.\n", "  The lid-driven cavity flow is a well-known benchmark problem for the\nvalidation of new numerical methods and techniques. In experimental and\nnumerical studies with viscoelastic fluids in such lid-driven flows,\npurely-elastic instabilities have been shown to appear even at very low\nReynolds numbers. A finite-volume viscoelastic code, using the log-conformation\nformulation, is used in this work to probe the effect of viscoelasticity on the\nappearance of such instabilities in two-dimensional lid-driven cavities for a\nwide range of aspect ratios (0.125 < height/length < 4.0), at different Deborah\nnumbers under creeping-flow conditions and to understand the effects of\nregularization of the lid velocity. The effect of the viscoelasticity on the\nsteady-state results and on the critical conditions for the onset of the\nelastic instabilities are described and compared to experimental results.\n", "  We present the outline and first results of a project using the synergies of\nthe long term blazar radiomillimetre monitoring program F-GAMMA, the continued\nscanning of the millimetre-submillimetre sky by the Planck satellite, together\nwith several dedicated observing programs at the Effelsberg 100m telescope, to\nobtain a data sample unprecedented in both time resolution and frequency span.\n", "  Clues to the origins and evolution of our Galaxy can be found in the\nkinematics of stars around us. Remnants of accreted satellite galaxies produce\nover- densities in velocity-space, which can remain coherent for much longer\nthan spatial over-densities. This chapter reviews a number of studies that have\nhunted for these accretion relics, both in the nearby solar-neighborhood and\nthe more-distant stellar halo. Many observational surveys have driven this\nfield forwards, from early work with the Hipparcos mission, to contemporary\nsurveys like RAVE & SDSS. This active field continues to flourish, providing\nmany new discoveries, and will be revolutionised as the Gaia mission delivers\nprecise proper motions for a billion stars in our Galaxy.\n", "  Novel mechanism leading to excitation of absolute two plasmon parametric\ndecay instability (TPDI) of a pump extraordinary (X) wave is discussed. It is\nshown that the upper hybrid (UH) plasmon can be 3D trapped in the presence of\nboth a nonmonotonous density profile and a finite-size pump beam in a plane\nperpendicular to the plasma inhomogeneity direction. This leads to excitation\nof the absolute TPDI of the pump X wave, which manifests itself in temporal\nexponential growth of the trapped daughter UH wave amplitude and is perhaps the\nmost dangerous instability for mm-waves, widely utilized nowadays in tokamak\nand stellarators for local plasma heating and current drive and being\nconsidered for application in ITER.\n", "  Adsorption and separation properties of gyroidal nanoporous carbons (GNCs) -\na new class of exotic nanocarbon materials are studied for the first time using\nhyper parallel tempering Monte Carlo Simulation technique. Porous structure of\nGNC models is evaluated by the method proposed by Bhattacharya and Gubbins. All\nthe studied structures are strictly microporous. Next, mechanisms of Ar\nadsorption are described basing on the analysis of adsorption isotherms,\nenthalpy plots, the values of Henry's constants, $\\alpha_{s}$ and adsorption\npotential distribution plots. It is concluded that below pore diameters ca. 0.8\nnm, primary micropore filling process dominates. For structures possessing\nlarger micropores, primary and secondary micropore filling mechanism is\nobserved. Finally, the separation properties of GNC toward CO$_2$/CH$_4$,\nCO$_2$/N$_2$, and CH$_4$/N$_2$ mixtures are discussed and compared with\nseparation properties of Virtual Porous Carbon models. GNCs may be considered\nas potential adsorbents for gas mixture separation, having separation\nefficiency similar or even higher than activated carbons with similar diameters\nof pores.\n", "  By means of Monte Carlo computer simulations in the isothermal-isobaric\nensemble, we investigated the interaction of a hydrophobic ligand with the\nhydrophobic surfaces of various curvatures (planar, convex and concave). A\nsimple two-dimensional model of water, hydrophobic ligand and surface was used.\nHydration/dehidration phenomena concerning water molecules confined close to\nthe molecular surface were investigated. A notable dewetting of the hydrophobic\nsurfaces was observed together with the reorientation of the water molecules\nclose to the surface. The hydrogen bonding network was formed to accommodate\ncavities next to the surfaces as well as beyond the first hydration shell. The\neffects were most strongly pronounced in the case of concave surfaces having\nlarge curvature. This simplified model can be further used to evaluate the\nthermodynamic fingerprint of the docking of hydrophobic ligands.\n", "  We use density functional theory to investigate adsorption of liquid mixtures\non solid surfaces modified with end-grafted chains. The chains are modelled as\nfreely joined spheres. The fluid molecules are spherical. All spherical species\ninteract via the Lennard-Jones (12-6) potential. The Lennard-Jones (9-3)\npotential describes interactions of solvent molecules with the substrate. We\nstudy the relative excess adsorption isotherms, the structure of surface layer\nand its composition. The impact of the following parameters on adsorption is\ndiscussed: the grafting density, the grafted chain length, interactions of\nsolvent molecules with grafted chains and with the substrate, and the presence\nof active groups in grafted chains. The theoretical results are consistent with\nexperimental observations.\n", "  In this text we review a few structural properties of matrix models that\nshould at least partly generalize to random tensor models. We review some\naspects of the loop equations for matrix models and their algebraic counterpart\nfor tensor models. Despite the generic title of this review, we, in particular,\ninvoke the Topological Recursion. We explain its appearance in matrix models.\nThen we state that a family of tensor models provides a natural example which\nsatisfies a version of the most general form of the topological recursion,\nnamed the blobbed topological recursion. We discuss the difficulties of\nextending the technical solutions existing for matrix models to tensor models.\nSome proofs are not published yet but will be given in a coming paper, the rest\nof the results are well known in the literature.\n", "  Simulations for the density and potential profiles of the ions in the planar\nelectrical double layer of a model electrolyte or an ionic liquid are reported.\nThe ions of a real electrolyte or an ionic liquid are usually not spheres; in\nionic liquids, the cations are molecular ions. In the past, this asymmetry has\nbeen modelled by considering spheres that are asymmetric in size and/or valence\n(viz., the primitive model) or by dimer cations that are formed by tangentially\ntouching spheres. In this paper we consider spherical ions that are asymmetric\nin size and mimic the asymmetrical shape through an off-center charge that is\nlocated away from the center of the cation spheres, while the anion charge is\nat the center of anion spheres. The various singlet density and potential\nprofiles are compared to (i) the dimer situation, that is, the constituent\nspheres of the dimer cation are tangentially tethered, and (ii) the standard\nprimitive model. The results reveal the double layer structure to be\nsubstantially impacted especially when the cation is the counterion. As well as\nbeing of intrinsic interest, this off-center charge model may be useful for\ntheories that consider spherical models and introduce the off-center charge as\na perturbation.\n", "  In simple colloidal suspensions, clusters are various multimers that result\nfrom colloid self-association and exist in equilibrium with monomers.There are\ntwo types of potentials that are known to produce clusters: a) potentials that\nresult from the competition between short-range attraction and long-range\nrepulsion and are characterized by a global minimum and a repulsive tail and b)\npurely repulsive potentials which have a soft shoulder. Using computer\nsimulations, we demonstrate in this work that potentials with a local minimum\nand a repulsive tail, not belonging to either of the known types, are also\ncapable of generating clusters. A detailed comparative analysis shows that the\nnew type of cluster-forming potential serves as a bridge between the other two.\nThe new clusters are expanded in shape and their assembly is driven by entropy,\nlike in the purely repulsive systems but only at low density. At high density,\nclusters are collapsed and stabilized by energy, in common with the systems\nwith competing attractive and repulsive interactions.\n", "  Structural modification of adsorbed overlayers by means of external factors\nis an important objective in the fabrication of stimuli-responsive materials\nwith adjustable physicochemical properties. In this contribution we present a\ncoarse-grained Monte Carlo model of the confinement-induced chiral self-sorting\nof hockey stick-shaped enantiomers adsorbed on a triangular lattice. It is\nassumed that the adsorbed overlayer consists of \"normal\" molecules that are\ncapable of adopting any of the six planar orientations imposed by the symmetry\nof the lattice and molecular directors having only one permanent orientation,\nthat reflect the coupling of these species with an external directional field.\nOur investigations focus on the influence of the amount fraction of the\nmolecular directors, temperature and surface coverage on the extent of the\nchiral segregation. The simulated results demonstrate that the molecular\ndirectors can have a significant effect on the ordering in enantiopure\noverlayers, while for the corresponding racemates their role is largely\ndiminished. These findings can be helpful in designing strategies to improve\nmethods of fabrication of homochiral surfaces and enantioselective adsorbents.\n", "  Ice-water, water-vapor interfaces and ice surface are studied by molecular\ndynamics simulations with the SPC/E model of water molecules having the purpose\nto estimate the profiles of electrostatic potential across the interfaces. We\nhave proposed a methodology for calculating the profiles of electrostatic\npotential based on a trial particle, which showed good agreement for the case\nof electrostatic potential profile of the water-vapor interface of TIP4P model\ncalculated in another way. The measured profile of electrostatic potential for\nthe pure ice-water interface decreases towards the liquid bulk region, which is\nin agreement with simulations of preferential direction of motion of Li$^{+}$\nand F$^{-}$ solute ions at the liquid side of the ice-water interface. These\nresults are discussed in connection with the Workman-Reynolds effect.\n", "  The mean field approximation is formulated within the framework of the\ndensity field theory to study the properties of a Maier-Saupe nematogenic fluid\nnear a hard wall. The density and the order parameter profiles are obtained\nusing the analytical expressions derived in the linearized mean field\napproximation. The temperature dependencies of the contact values of the\ndensity and order parameter profiles are analyzed in detail. To estimate a\nvalidity of the applied approximations, the obtained theoretical results are\ncompared with the original computer simulation data.\n", "  We have performed a full time- and luminosity-resolved spectral analysis of\nthe high-mass X-ray binary 4U 1538-522 using the available RXTE, INTEGRAL, and\nSuzaku data, examining both phase-averaged and pulse-phase-constrained datasets\nand focusing on the behavior of the cyclotron resonance scattering feature\n(CRSF). No statistically significant trend between the energy of the CRSF and\nluminosity is observed in the combined dataset. However, the CRSF energy\nappears to have increased by ~1.5 keV in the ~8.5 years between the RXTE and\nSuzaku measurements, with Monte Carlo simulations finding the Suzaku\nmeasurement 4.6$\\sigma$ above the RXTE points. Interestingly, the increased\nSuzaku CRSF energy is much more significant and robust in the\npulse-phase-constrained spectra from the peak of the main pulse, suggesting a\nchange that is limited to a single magnetic pole. The 7 years of RXTE\nmeasurements do not show any strongly-significant evolution with time on their\nown. We discuss the significance of the CRSF's behavior with respect to\nluminosity and time in the context of historical observations of this source as\nwell as recent observational and theoretical work concerning the neutron star\naccretion column, and suggest some mechanisms by which the observed change over\ntime could occur.\n", "  Presentation of the probability as an intrinsic property of the nature leads\nresearchers to switch from deterministic to stochastic description of the\nphenomena. The procedure of stochastization of one-step process was formulated.\nIt allows to write down the master equation based on the type of of the kinetic\nequations and assumptions about the nature of the process. The kinetics of the\ninteraction has recently attracted attention because it often occurs in the\nphysical, chemical, technical, biological, environmental, economic, and\nsociological systems. However, there are no general methods for the direct\nstudy of this equation. Leaving in the expansion terms up to the second order\nwe can get the Fokker-Planck equation, and thus the Langevin equation. It\nshould be clearly understood that these equations are approximate recording of\nthe master equation. However, this does not eliminate the need for the study of\nthe master equation. Moreover, the power series produced during the master\nequation decomposition may be divergent (for example, in spatial models). This\nmakes it impossible to apply the classical perturbation theory. It is proposed\nto use quantum field perturbation theory for the statistical systems (the\nso-called Doi method). This work is a methodological material that describes\nthe principles of master equation solution based on quantum field perturbation\ntheory methods. The characteristic property of the work is that it is\nintelligible for non-specialists in quantum field theory. As an example the\nVerhulst model is used because of its simplicity and clarity (the first order\nequation is independent of the spatial variables, however, contains\nnon-linearity). We show the full equivalence of the operator and combinatorial\nmethods of obtaining and study of the one-step process master equation.\n", "  We propose a generalization of the quantum hashing technique based on the\nnotion of the small-bias sets. These sets have proved useful in different areas\nof computer science, and here their properties give an optimal construction for\nsuccinct quantum presentation of elements of any finite abelian group, which\ncan be used in various computational and cryptographic scenarios. The known\nquantum fingerprinting schemas turn out to be the special cases of the proposed\nquantum hashing for the corresponding abelian group.\n", "  There are many viable combinations of texture zeros in lepton mass matrices.\nWe propose an economical and stable mass texture. Analytical and numerical\nresults on mixing parameters and the effective mass of neutrinos are obtained.\nThese results satisfy new constraints from neutrinos oscillation experiments\nand cosmological observations. Our proposition reveals that in the complex\nforest of neutrinos mixing models, a simple and robust one is still possible.\n", "  Social media outlets such as Twitter constitute valuable data sources for\nunderstanding human activities in the virtual world from a geographic\nperspective. This paper examines spatial distribution of tweets and densities\nwithin cities. The cities refer to natural cities that are automatically\naggregated from a country's small street blocks, so called city blocks. We\nadopted street blocks (rather than census tracts) as the basic geographic units\nand topological center (rather than geometric center) in order to assess how\ntweets and densities vary from the center to the peripheral border. We found\nthat, within a city from the center to the periphery, the tweets first increase\nand then decrease, while the densities decrease in general. These increases and\ndecreases fluctuate dramatically, and differ significantly from those if census\ntracts are used as the basic geographic units. We also found that the decrease\nof densities from the center to the periphery is less significant, and even\ndisappears, if an arbitrarily defined city border is adopted. These findings\nprove that natural cities and their topological centers are better than their\ncounterparts (conventionally defined cities and city centers) for geographic\nresearch. Based on this study, we believe that tweet densities can be a good\nsurrogate of population densities. If this belief is proved to be true, social\nmedia data could help solve the dispute surrounding exponential or power\nfunction of urban population density.\n  Keywords: Big data, natural cities, street blocks, urban density, topological\ndistance\n", "  Topological chaos has emerged as a powerful tool to investigate fluid mixing.\nWhile this theory can guarantee a lower bound on the stretching rate of certain\nmaterial lines, it does not indicate what fraction of the fluid actually\nparticipates in this minimally mandated mixing. Indeed, the area in which\neffective mixing takes place depends on physical parameters such as the\nReynolds number. To help clarify this dependency, we numerically simulate the\neffects of a batch stirring device on a 2D incompressible Newtonian fluid in\nthe laminar regime. In particular, we calculate the finite time Lyapunov\nexponent (FTLE) field for three different stirring protocols, one topologically\ncomplex (pseudo-Anosov) and two simple (finite-order), over a range of\nviscosities. After extracting appropriate measures indicative of both the\namount of mixing and the area of effective mixing from the FTLE field, we see a\nclearly defined Reynolds number range in which the relative efficacy of the\npseudo-Anosov protocol over the finite-order protocols justifies the\napplication of topological chaos. More unexpectedly, we see that while the\nmeasures of effective mixing area increase with increasing Reynolds number for\nthe finite-order protocols, they actually exhibit non-monotonic behavior for\nthe pseudo-Anosov protocol.\n", "  We give the comment why the supermassive black hole exists at the center of\nalmost all galaxies. We consider the origin of the supermassive black hole from\nthe point of view of the density of the matter. If the density of the matter is\nfixed and such matter can come together by the gravitational attraction, such\nstellar object eventually becomes the black hole. If the density of the matter\nis that of the atom, such matter naturally comes together to form the black\nhole by the gravitational attraction. This is expected to be the process to\nform the supermassive black hole. In this way, we can understand that there\nexists supermassive black hole at the center of almost all galaxies, because\nthere is no delicate process to evolve into the black hole.\n", "  Integral identities for particular Bloch functions in finite periodic systems\nare derived. All following statements are proven for a finite domain consisting\nof an integer number of unit cells. It is shown that matrix elements of\nparticular Bloch functions with respect to periodic differential operators\nvanish identically. The real valuedness, the time-independence and a summation\nproperty of the expectation values of periodic differential operators applied\nto superpositions of specific Bloch functions are derived.\n", "  We use the idea of the symmetry between the spacetime coordinates x^\\mu and\nthe energy-momentum p^\\mu in quantum theory to construct a momentum space\nquantum gravity geometry with a metric s_{\\mu\\nu} and a curvature\nP^\\lambda_{\\mu\\nu\\rho}. For a closed maximally symmetric momentum space with a\nconstant 3-curvature, the volume of the p-space admits a cutoff with an\ninvariant maximum momentum a. A Wheeler-DeWitt-type wave equation is obtained\nin the momentum space representation. The vacuum energy density and the\nself-energy of a charged particle are shown to be finite, and modifications of\nthe electromagnetic radiation density and the entropy density of a system of\nparticles occur for high frequencies.\n", "  The RG functions of the 2D $n$-vector $\\phi^4$ model are calculated in the\nfive-loop approximation. Perturbative series for the $\\beta$ function and\ncritical exponents are resummed by the Pade-Borel and Pade-Borel-Leroy\ntechniques, resummation procedures are optimized and an accuracy of the\nnumerical results is estimated. In the Ising case $n = 1$ as well as in the\nothers ($n = 0$, $n = -1$, $n = 2, 3,...32$) an account for the five-loop term\nis found to shift the Wilson fixed point location only briefly, leaving it\noutside the segment formed by the results of the corresponding lattice\ncalculations; even error bars of the RG and lattice estimates do not overlap in\nthe most cases studied. This is argued to reflect the influence of the singular\n(non-analytical) contribution to the $\\beta$ function that can not be found\nperturbatively. The evaluation of the critical exponents for $n = 1$, $n = 0$\nand $n = -1$ in the five-loop approximation and comparison of the numbers\nobtained with their known exact counterparts confirm the conclusion that\nnon-analytical contributions are visible in two dimensions.\n", "  We examine the ghost state in the Lee model, and give the physically\nmeaningful interpretatation for norm of the ghost state. According to this\ninterpretation, the semi-positivity of the norm is guaranteed.\n"]}
