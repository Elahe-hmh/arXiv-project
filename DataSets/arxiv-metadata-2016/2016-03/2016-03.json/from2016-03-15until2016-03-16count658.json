"10.1209/0295-5075/77/40001"], "abstract": ["  For an upstream supersonic flow past a straight-sided cone in $\\R^3$ whose\nvertex angle is less than the critical angle, a transonic (supersonic-subsonic)\nshock-front attached to the cone vertex can be formed in the flow. In this\npaper we analyze the stability of transonic shock-fronts in three-dimensional\nsteady potential flow past a perturbed cone. We establish that the self-similar\ntransonic shock-front solution is conditionally stable in structure with\nrespect to the conical perturbation of the cone boundary and the upstream flow\nin appropriate function spaces. In particular, it is proved that the slope of\nthe shock-front tends asymptotically to the slope of the unperturbed\nself-similar shock-front downstream at infinity.\n", "  General conservation equations are derived for 2D dense granular flows from\nthe Euler equation within the Boussinesq approximation. In steady flows, the 2D\nfields of granular temperature, vorticity and stream function are shown to be\nencoded in two scalar functions only. We checked such prediction on steady\nsurface flows in a rotating drum simulated through the Non-Smooth Contact\nDynamics method. This result is non trivial because granular flows are\ndissipative and therefore not necessarily compatible with Euler equation.\nFinally, we briefly discuss some possible ways to predict theoretically these\ntwo functions using statistical mechanics.\n", "  A class of multidimensional integrable hierarchies connected with commutation\nof general (unreduced) (N+1)-dimensional vector fields containing derivative\nover spectral variable is considered. They are represented in the form of\ngenerating equation, as well as in the Lax-Sato form. A dressing scheme based\non nonlinear vector Riemann problem is presented for this class. The\nhierarchies connected with Manakov-Santini equation and Dunajski system are\nconsidered as illustrative examples.\n", "  Atomic parity violation has been observed in the 6s^2 1S0 - 5d6s 3D1 408-nm\nforbidden transition of ytterbium. The parity-violating amplitude is found to\nbe two orders of magnitude larger than in cesium, where the most precise\nexperiments to date have been performed. This is in accordance with theoretical\npredictions and constitutes the largest atomic parity-violating amplitude yet\nobserved. This also opens the way to future measurements of neutron skins and\nanapole moments by comparing parity-violating amplitudes for various isotopes\nand hyperfine components of the transition.\n", "  We present a detailed description of the observation of parity violation in\nthe 1S0-3D1 408-nm forbidden transition of ytterbium, a brief report of which\nappeared earlier. Linearly polarized 408-nm light interacts with Yb atoms in\ncrossed E- and B-fields. The probability of the 408-nm transition contains a\nparity violating term, proportional to (Elight . B)[(E x Elight) . B], arising\nfrom interference between the parity violating amplitude and the Stark\namplitude due to the E-field (Elight is the electric field of the light). The\ntransition probability is detected by measuring the population of the 3P0\nstate, to which 65% of the atoms excited to the 3D1 state spontaneously decay.\nThe population of the 3P0 state is determined by resonantly exciting the atoms\nwith 649-nm light to the 6s7s 3S1 state and collecting the fluorescence\nresulting from its decay. Systematic corrections due to E-field and B-field\nimperfections are determined in auxiliary experiments. The statistical\nuncertainty is dominated by parasitic frequency excursions of the 408-nm\nexcitation light due to imperfect stabilization of the optical reference with\nrespect to the atomic resonance. The present uncertainties are 9% statistical\nand 8% systematic. Methods of improving the accuracy for the future experiments\nare discussed.\n", "  We write the variation of the statistical entropy of matter fields outside a\nblack hole along a Killing vector. This is done for generalized theories of\ngravity, using a Lie derivative and identification of the energy momentum\ntensor.\n", "  Clean Si(111)-(7{x7) surfaces, followed by air-exposure, have been\ninvestigated by reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED) and\nscanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Fourier transforms (FTs) of STM images\nshow the presence of short range (7x7) order on the air-oxidized surface.\nComparison with FTs of STM images from a clean Si(111)-(7x7) surface shows that\nonly the 1/7th order spots are present on the air-oxidized surface. The oxide\nlayer is ~ 2-3 nm thick, as revealed by cross-sectional transmission electron\nmicroscopy (XTEM). Growth of Ag islands on these air-oxidized Si(111)-(7x7)\nsurfaces has been investigated by in-situ RHEED and STM and ex-situ XTEM and\nscanning electron microscopy. Ag deposition at room temperature leads to the\ngrowth of randomly oriented Ag islands while preferred orientation evolves when\nAg is deposited at higher substrate temperatures. For deposition at 550{\\deg}C\nface centered cubic Ag nanoislands grow with a predominant epitaxial\norientation [1 -1 0]Ag || [1 -1 0]Si, (111)Ag || (111)Si along with its twin\n[-1 1 0]Ag || [1 -1 0]Si, (111)Ag || (111)Si, as observed for epitaxial growth\nof Ag on Si(111) surfaces. The twins are thus rotated by a 180{\\deg} rotation\nof the Ag unit cell about the Si [111] axis. It is intriguing that Ag\nnanoislands follow an epitaxial relationship with the Si(111) substrate in\nspite of the presence of a 2-3 nm thick oxide layer between Ag and Si.\nApparently the short range order on the oxide surface influences the\ncrystallographic orientation of the Ag nanoislands.\n", "  We calculate the off-diagonal density matrix of the homogeneous electron gas\nat zero temperature using unbiased Reptation Monte Carlo for various densities\nand extrapolate the momentum distribution, and the kinetic and potential\nenergies to the thermodynamic limit. Our results on the renormalization factor\nallows us to validate approximate G_0W_0 calculations concerning quasiparticle\nproperties over a broad density region (1 <= r_s <= 10) and show that near the\nFermi surface, vertex corrections and self-consistency aspects almost cancel\neach other out.\n", "  We analyze the extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit of Fermi liquid\nproperties of the homogeneous electron gas in two and three dimensions. Using\nfield theory, we explicitly calculate finite-size effects of the total energy,\nthe renormalization factor, and the effective mass at the Fermi surface within\nthe random phase approximation (RPA) and discuss the validity for general\nmetallic systems.\n", "  In this paper, we derive scaling relations between photometric observable\nquantities and disk galaxy rotation velocity V_rot, or Tully-Fisher relations\n(TFRs). Our methodology is dictated by our purpose of obtaining purely\nphotometric, minimal-scatter estimators of V_rot applicable to large galaxy\nsamples from imaging surveys. To achieve this goal, we have constructed a\nsample of 189 disk galaxies at redshifts z<0.1 with long-slit H-alpha\nspectroscopy from Pizagno et al. (2007) and new observations. By construction,\nthis sample is a fair subsample of a large, well-defined parent disk sample of\n~170 000 galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7\n(SDSS DR7). The optimal photometric estimator of V_rot we find is stellar mass\nM_* from Bell et al. (2003), based on the linear combination of a luminosity\nand a colour. Assuming a Kroupa IMF, we find: log [V_{80}/(km s^-1)] = (2.142\n+/- 0.004)+(0.278 +/- 0.010)[log (M_*/M_sun)-10.10], where V_{80} is the\nrotation velocity measured at the radius R_{80} containing 80 per cent of the\ni-band galaxy light. This relation has an intrinsic Gaussian scatter of 0.036\n+/- 0.005 dex and a measured scatter of 0.056 dex in log V_{80}. For a fixed\nIMF, we find that the dynamical-to-stellar mass ratios within R_{80},\n(M_dyn/M_*)(R_{80}), decrease from approximately 10 to 3, as stellar mass\nincreases from M_* ~ 10^9 to 10^{11} M_sun. At a fixed stellar mass,\n(M_dyn/M_*)(R_{80}) increases with disk size, so that it correlates more\ntightly with stellar surface density than with stellar mass or disk size alone.\nIn future work, we will use these results to study disk galaxy formation and\nevolution, and perform a fair, statistical analysis of the dynamics and masses\nof a photometrically-selected sample of disk galaxies. [Abridged]\n", "  Totally symmetric arbitrary spin massless and massive free fields in flat and\nAdS spaces and conformal fields in flat space are studied. Extended gauge\ninvariant hamiltonian action for such fields is obtained. The action is\nconstructed out of phase space fields and Lagrange multipliers which are free\nof algebraic constraints. Gauge transformations of the phase space fields and\nLagrange multipliers are derived. Use of the Poincare parametrization of AdS\nspace allows us to treat fields in flat space and AdS space on equal footing.\n", "  By using Stationary-to-Randers correspondence (SRC), a characterization of\nlight and time-convexity of the boundary of a region of a standard stationary\n(n+1)-spacetime is obtained, in terms of the convexity of the boundary of a\ndomain in a Finsler n or (n+1)-space of Randers type. The latter convexity is\nanalyzed in depth and, as a consequence, the causal simplicity and the\nexistence of causal geodesics confined in the region and connecting a point to\na stationary line are characterized. Applications to asymptotically flat\nspacetimes include the light-convexity of stationary hypersurfaces which\nproject in a spacelike section of an end onto a sphere of large radius, as well\nas the characterization of their time-convexity with natural physical\ninterpretations. The lens effect of both light rays and freely falling massive\nparticles with a finite lifetime, (i.e. the multiplicity of such connecting\ncurves) is characterized in terms of the focalization of the geodesics in the\nunderlying Randers manifolds.\n", "  The concept of feature selectivity in sensory signal processing can be\nformalized as dimensionality reduction: in a stimulus space of very high\ndimensions, neurons respond only to variations within some smaller, relevant\nsubspace. But if neural responses exhibit invariances, then the relevant\nsubspace typically cannot be reached by a Euclidean projection of the original\nstimulus. We argue that, in several cases, we can make progress by appealing to\nthe simplest nonlinear construction, identifying the relevant variables as\nquadratic forms, or \"stimulus energies.\" Natural examples include\nnon-phase-locked cells in the auditory system, complex cells in visual cortex,\nand motion-sensitive neurons in the visual system. Generalizing the idea of\nmaximally informative dimensions, we show that one can search for the kernels\nof the relevant quadratic forms by maximizing the mutual information between\nthe stimulus energy and the arrival times of action potentials. Simple\nimplementations of this idea successfully recover the underlying properties of\nmodel neurons even when the number of parameters in the kernel is comparable to\nthe number of action potentials and stimuli are completely natural. We explore\nseveral generalizations that allow us to incorporate plausible structure into\nthe kernel and thereby restrict the number of parameters. We hope that this\napproach will add significantly to the set of tools available for the analysis\nof neural responses to complex, naturalistic stimuli.\n", "  The Compass Project is a self-formed group of graduate and undergraduate\nstudents in the physical sciences at UC Berkeley. Our goals are to improve\nundergraduate physics education, provide opportunities for professional\ndevelopment, and increase retention of students-especially those from\npopulations typically underrepresented in the physical sciences. Compass\nfosters a diverse, collaborative student community by providing a wide range of\nservices, including a summer program and fall/spring seminar courses. We\ndescribe Compass's cultural values, discuss how community members are\nintroduced to and help shape those values, and demonstrate how a single set of\nvalues informs the structure of both our classroom and organization.We\nemphasize that all members of the Compass community participate in, and benefit\nfrom, our cultural values, regardless of status as student, teacher, or\notherwise.\n", "  This work focuses on the interaction of an acoustical quasi-Gaussian beam\ncentered on a rigid immovable sphere, during which at least three physical\nphenomena arise, namely, the (axial) acoustic scattering, the instantaneous\nforce, and the time-average radiation force which are investigated here. The\nquasi-Gaussian beam is an exact solution of the source free Helmholtz wave\nequation and is characterized by an arbitrary waist w0 and a diffraction\nconvergence length known as the Rayleigh range z_R. Specialized formulations\nfor the scattering and the instantaneous force function as well as the\n(time-averaged) radiation force function are provided. Numerical computations\nillustrate the variations of the backscattering form-function, the\ninstantaneous force function and the (time-averaged) radiation force function\nversus the dimensionless frequency ka (where k is the wave number and a is the\nradius of the sphere), and the results show significant differences from the\nplane wave limit when the dimensionless beam waist parameter kw0 < 25. The\nradiation force function may be used to calibrate high-frequency transducers\noperating with this type of beam. Furthermore, the theoretical analysis can be\nreadily extended to the case of other types of spheres (i.e. elastic,\nviscoelastic, shells, coated spheres and shells) providing that their\nappropriate scattering coefficients are used.\n", "  We describe a simple experiment for measuring the thermal expansion\ncoefficient of a metal wire and discuss how the experiment can be used as a\ntool for exploring the interplay of measurement uncertainty and scientific\nmodels. In particular, we probe the regimes of applicability of three models of\nthe wire: stiff and massless, elastic and massless, and elastic and massive.\nUsing both analytical and empirical techniques, we present the conditions under\nwhich the wire's mass and elasticity can be neglected. By accounting for these\neffects, we measure nichrome's thermal expansion coefficient to be 17.1(1.3)\nppm/K, which is consistent with the accepted value at the 8% level.\n", "  Heterostructures utilizing topological insulators exhibit a remarkable\nspin-torque efficiency. However, the exact origin of the strong torque, in\nparticular whether it stems from the spin-momentum locking of the topological\nsurface states or rather from spin-Hall physics of the topological-insulator\nbulk remains unclear. Here, we explore a mechanism of spin-torque generation\npurely based on the topological surface states. We consider\ntopological-insulator-based bilayers involving ferromagnetic metal (TI/FM) and\nmagnetically doped topological insulators (TI/mdTI), respectively. By ascribing\nthe key theoretical differences between the two setups to location and number\nof active surface states, we describe both setups within the same framework of\nspin diffusion of the non-equilibrium spin density of the topological surface\nstates. For the TI/FM bilayer, we find large spin-torque efficiencies of\nroughly equal magnitude for both in-plane and out-of-plane spin torques. For\nthe TI/mdTI bilayer, we elucidate the dominance of the spin-transfer-like\ntorque. However, we cannot explain the orders of magnitude enhancement\nreported. Nevertheless, our model gives an intuitive picture of spin-torque\ngeneration in topological-insulator-based bilayers and provides theoretical\nconstraints on spin-torque generation due to topological surface states.\n", "  We start by considering infinite dimensional Markovian dynamics in R^m\ngenerated by operators of hypocoercive type and for such models we obtain short\nand long time pointwise estimates for all the derivatives, of any order and in\nany direction, along the semigroup. We then look at infinite dimensional models\n(in (Rm)^{Z ^d}) produced by the interaction of infinitely many finite\ndimensional dissipative dynamics of the type indicated above. For these\ninfinite dimensional models we study finite speed of propagation of\ninformation, well-posedness of the semigroup, time behaviour of the derivatives\nand strong ergodicity problem.\n", "  We theoretically study the effect of a nonmagnetic impurity in heavy fermion\nsuperconductor CeCoIn$_{5}$ within a realistic band model and the T-matrix\napproximation approach. By considering two known possible pairing symmetry\ncandidates $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ and $d_{xy}$, we find that although both total\ndensity of states exhibit a similar V-shaped gaplike feature, only the\n$d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave pairing symmetry gives rise to robust intragap impurity\nresonance states reflected by the resonance peaks near the Fermi energy in the\nlocal density of states. These features can be readily probed by scanning\ntunneling microscopy experiments, and are proposed to shed light on the pairing\nsymmetry and provide hints on the microscopic mechanism of unconventional\nsuperconductivity in the Ce-based heavy fermion superconductors.\n", "  Recently, it was shown, that the absence of circular polarization of visible\nlight from quasars, severely constrains the interpretation of axion like\nparticles (ALPs) as a solution for the generation of the linear polarization.\nFurthermore, the new observation of the linear polarization in the radio\nwavelength from quasars, similar to the earlier observation performed in the\noptical band, makes the ALPs scenario inconsistent with at least one of the two\nobservations. In this study we extend this scenario, to two axion like\nparticles, one scalar and another pseudoscalar. We find, that the effects from\nscalar and pseudoscalar cancel out each other, thereby suppressing the circular\npolarization, while preserving consistent linear polarization, as observed in\nboth visible and radio waves bands.\n", "  We define the center of mass and spin of an isolated system in General\nRelativity. The resulting relationships between these variables and the total\nlinear and angular momentum of the gravitational system are remarkably similar\nto their Newtonian counterparts, though only variables at the null boundary of\nan asymptotically flat spacetime are used for their definition. We also derive\nequations of motion linking their time evolution to the emitted gravitational\nradiation. The results are then compared to other approaches. In particular one\nobtains unexpected similarities as well as some differences with results\nobtained in the Post Newtonian literature . These equations of motion should be\nuseful when describing the radiation emitted by compact sources such as\ncoalescing binaries capable of producing gravitational kicks, supernovas, or\nscattering of compact objects.\n", "  We have studied the low-energy excitations in a minimalistic protected\nJosephson circuit which contains two basic elements (rhombi) characterized by\nthe $\\pi$ periodicity of the Josephson energy. Novel design of these elements,\nwhich reduces their sensitivity to the offset charge fluctuations, has been\nemployed. We have observed that the life time $T_{1}$ of the first excited\nstate of this quantum circuit in the protected regime is increased up to $70\\mu\ns$, a factor of $\\sim100$ longer than that in the unprotected state. The\nquality factor $\\omega_{01}T_{1}$ of this qubit exceeds $10^{6}$ . Our results\nare in agreement with theoretical expectations; they demonstrate the\nfeasibility of symmetry protection in the rhombi-based qubits fabricated with\nexisting technology.\n", "  The conformal loop ensemble $\\operatorname {CLE}_{\\kappa}$ with parameter\n$8/3<\\kappa<8$ is the canonical conformally invariant measure on countably\ninfinite collections of noncrossing loops in a simply connected domain. Given\n$\\kappa$ and $\\nu$, we compute the almost-sure Hausdorff dimension of the set\nof points $z$ for which the number of CLE loops surrounding the disk of radius\n$\\varepsilon$ centered at $z$ has asymptotic growth $\\nu\\log (1/\\varepsilon )$\nas $\\varepsilon \\to0$. By extending these results to a setting in which the\nloops are given i.i.d. weights, we give a CLE-based treatment of the extremes\nof the Gaussian free field.\n", "  We prove the complete asymptotic expansion of the spectral function (the\nintegral kernel of the spectral projection) of a Schrodinger operator\n$H=-\\Delta+b$ acting in $R^d$ when the potential $b$ is real and either smooth\nperiodic, or generic quasi-periodic (finite linear combination of\nexponentials), or belongs to a wide class of almost-periodic functions.\n", "  In this manuscript, the field equations of a chameleon field in which the\nmatter Lagrangian term is a general function of the scalar field as well as\nmatter field, are derived. The equations are then expressed in\nFriedmann--Lema\\^itre--Robertson--Walker~(FLRW) framework and the associated\nphase portraits and a power law solution are discussed in details. It is shown\nthat why non-minimal coupling between the chameleon and matter fields leads to\nan energy transfer between the fields which consequently, affects the expansion\nrate of the universe. The transfer direction is determined by the second law of\nthermodynamics. The solution indicates that an accelerating expansion of the\nuniverse can be described as a result of the energy flow from the chameleon\nfield to matter field.\n", "  Several expressions for the $j$-th component $\\left( x_{k}\\right)_{j}$ of the\n$k$-th eigenvector $x_{k}$ of a symmetric matrix $A$ belonging to eigenvalue\n$\\lambda_{k}$ and normalized as $x_{k}^{T}x_{k}=1$ are presented. In\nparticular, the expression \\[ \\left(\nx_{k}\\right)_{j}^{2}=-\\frac{1}{c_{A}^{\\prime}\\left( \\lambda_{k}\\right)\n}\\det\\left( A_{\\backslash\\left\\{ j\\right\\} }-\\lambda_{k}I\\right) \\] where\n$c_{A}\\left( \\lambda\\right) =\\det\\left( A-\\lambda I\\right) $ is the\ncharacteristic polynomial of $A$, $c_{A}^{\\prime}\\left( \\lambda\\right)\n=\\frac{dc_{A}\\left( \\lambda\\right) }{d\\lambda}$ and $A_{\\backslash\\left\\{\nj\\right\\} }$ is obtained from $A$ by removal of row $j$ and column $j$,\nsuggests us to consider the square eigenvector component as a graph centrality\nmetric for node $j$ that reflects the impact of the removal of node $j$ from\nthe graph at an eigenfrequency/eigenvalue $\\lambda_{k}$ of a graph related\nmatrix (such as the adjacency or Laplacian matrix). Removal of nodes in a graph\nrelates to the robustness of a graph. The set of such nodal centrality metrics,\nthe squared eigenvector components $\\left( x_{k}\\right)_{j}^{2}$ of the\nadjacency matrix over all eigenvalue $\\lambda_{k}$ for each node $j$, is\n'ideal' in the sense of being complete, \\emph{almost} uncorrelated and\nmathematically precisely defined and computable. Fundamental weights (column\nsum of $X$) and dual fundamental weights (row sum of $X$) are introduced as\nspectral metrics that condense information embedded in the orthogonal\neigenvector matrix $X$, with elements $X_{ij}=\\left( x_{j}\\right)_{i}$.\n  In addition to the criterion {\\em If the algebraic connectivity is positive,\nthen the graph is connected}, we found an alternative condition: {\\em If\n$\\min_{1\\leq k\\leq N}\\left( \\lambda_{k}^{2}(A)\\right) =d_{\\min}$, then the\ngraph is disconnected.}\n", "  We establish Lieb-Thirring type inequalities for non self-adjoint relatively\ncompact perturbations of certain operators of mathematical physics. We apply\nour results to quantum Hamiltonians of Schr{\\\"o}dinger and Pauli with constant\nmagnetic field of strength $b\\textgreater{}0$. In particular, we use these\nbounds to obtain some information on the distribution of the eigenvalues of the\nperturbed operators in the neighborhood of their essential spectrum.\n", "  We calculate the three-loop thermodynamic potential of QCD at finite\ntemperature and chemical potential(s) using the hard-thermal-loop perturbation\ntheory (HTLpt) reorganization of finite temperature and density QCD. The\nresulting analytic thermodynamic potential allows us to compute the pressure,\nenergy density, and entropy density of the quark-gluon plasma. Using these we\ncalculate the trace anomaly, speed of sound, and second-, fourth-, and\nsixth-order quark number susceptibilities. For all observables considered we\nfind good agreement between our three-loop HTLpt calculations and available\nlattice data for temperatures above approximately 300 MeV.\n", "  We study systematically finite BRST-BFV transformations in the generalized\nHamiltonian formalism. We present explicitly their Jacobians and the form of a\nsolution to the compensation equation determining the functional field\ndependence of finite Fermionic parameters, necessary to generate arbitrary\nfinite change of gauge-fixing functions in the path integral.\n", "  We apply a new self-tuning mechanism to the well-known\nKachru-Kallosh-Linde-Trivedi (KKLT) model to address the cosmological constant\nproblem. In this mechanism the cosmological constant $\\lambda$ contains a\nsupersymmetry breaking term ${\\mathcal E}_{\\rm SB}$ besides the usual scalar\npotential ${\\mathcal V}_{\\rm scalar}$ of the $N=1$ supergravity, which is\ndistinguished from the usual theories where $\\lambda$ is directly identified\nwith ${\\mathcal V}_{\\rm scalar}$ alone. Also in this mechanism, whether\n$\\lambda$ vanishes or not is basically determined by the tensor structure of\nthe scalar potential density, not by the zero or nonzero values of the scalar\npotential itself. As a result of this application we find that the natural\nscenario for the vanishing $\\lambda$ of the present universe is to take one of\nthe AdS (rather than dS) vacua of KKLT as the background vacuum of our present\nuniverse. This AdS vacuum scenario has more nice properties as compared with dS\nvacua of the usual flux compctifications. The background vacuum is stable both\nclassically and quantum mechanically (no tunneling instabilities), and the\nvalue $\\lambda =0$ is also stable against quantum corrections because in this\nscenario the perturbative corrections of ${\\mathcal V}_{\\rm scalar}$ and\nquantum fluctuations $\\delta_Q {\\hat I}_{\\rm brane}^{(NS)} + \\delta_Q {\\hat\nI}_{\\rm brane}^{(R)}$ on the branes are all gauged away by an automatic\ncancelation between ${\\mathcal V}_{\\rm scalar} + \\delta_Q {\\hat I}_{\\rm\nbrane}^{(NS)} + \\delta_Q {\\hat I}_{\\rm brane}^{(R)}$ and ${\\mathcal E}_{\\rm\nSB}$.\n", "  We show, via three-dimensional\nimmersed-boundary-finite-element-lattice-Boltzmann simulations, that\ndeformability-based red blood cell (RBC) separation in deterministic lateral\ndisplacement (DLD) devices is possible. This is due to the\ndeformability-dependent lateral extension of RBCs and enables us to predict a\npriori which RBCs will be displaced in a given DLD geometry. Several diseases\naffect the deformability of human cells. Malaria-infected RBCs or sickle cells,\nfor example, tend to become stiffer than their healthy counterparts. It is\ntherefore desirable to design microfluidic devices which can detect those\ndiseases based on the cells' deformability fingerprint, rather than preparing\nsamples using expensive and time-consuming biochemical preparation steps. Our\nfindings should be helpful in the development of new methods for sorting cells\nand particles by deformability.\n", "  We present a physics inspired heuristic method for solving combinatorial\noptimization problems. Our approach is specifically motivated by the desire to\navoid trapping in metastable local minima- a common occurrence in hard problems\nwith multiple extrema. Our method involves (i) coupling otherwise independent\nsimulations of a system (\"replicas\") via geometrical distances as well as (ii)\nprobabilistic inference applied to the solutions found by individual replicas.\nThe {\\it ensemble} of replicas evolves as to maximize the inter-replica\ncorrelation while simultaneously minimize the local intra-replica cost function\n(e.g., the total path length in the Traveling Salesman Problem within each\nreplica). We demonstrate how our method improves the performance of rudimentary\nlocal optimization schemes long applied to the NP hard Traveling Salesman\nProblem. In particular, we apply our method to the well-known \"$k$-opt\"\nalgorithm and examine two particular cases- $k=2$ and $k=3$. With the aid of\ngeometrical coupling alone, we are able to determine for the optimum tour\nlength on systems up to $280$ cities (an order of magnitude larger than the\nlargest systems typically solved by the bare $k=3$ opt). The probabilistic\nreplica-based inference approach improves $k-opt$ even further and determines\nthe optimal solution of a problem with $318$ cities and find tours whose total\nlength is close to that of the optimal solutions for other systems with a\nlarger number of cities.\n", "  We observe unusually narrow donor-bound exciton transitions (0.4 meV) in the\nphotoluminescence spectra of GaN nanowire ensembles grown on Si(111) substrates\nat very high (> 850 degrees Celsius) temperatures. The spectra of these samples\nreveal a prominent transition of excitons bound to neutral Si impurities which\nis not observed for samples grown under standard conditions. Motivated by these\nexperimental results, we investigate theoretically the impact of\nsurface-induced internal electric fields on the binding energy of donors by a\ncombined Monte Carlo and envelope function approach. We obtain the ranges of\ndoping and diameter for which the potential is well described using the Poisson\nequation, where one assumes a spatially homogeneous distribution of dopants.\nOur calculations also show that surface donors in nanowires with a diameter\nsmaller than 100 nm are ionized when the surface electric field is larger than\nabout 10 kV/cm, corresponding to a doping level higher than 2 x 10^16 cm^-3.\nThis result explains the experimental observation: since the (D+,X) complex is\nnot stable in GaN, surface-donor-bound excitons do not contribute to the\nphotoluminescence spectra of GaN nanowires above a certain doping level, and\nthe linewidth reflects the actual structural perfection of the nanowire\nensemble.\n", "  We present an approach for calculating coarse-grained angle-resolved\neffective pair potentials for uniaxial molecules. For integrating out the\nintramolecular degrees of freedom we apply umbrella sampling and steered\ndynamics techniques in atomistically-resolved molecular dynamics (MD) computer\nsimulations. Throughout this study we focus on disk-like molecules such as\ncoronene. To develop the methods we focus on integrating out the van-der-Waals\nand intramolecular interactions, while electrostatic charge contributions are\nneglected. The resulting coarse-grained pair potential reveals a strong\ntemperature and angle dependence. In the next step we fit the numerical data\nwith various Gay-Berne-like potentials to be used in more efficient simulations\non larger scales. The quality of the resulting coarse-grained results is\nevaluated by comparing their pair and many-body structure as well as some\nthermodynamic quantities self-consistently to the outcome of atomistic MD\nsimulations of many-particle systems. We find that angle-resolved potentials\nare essential not only to accurately describe crystal structures but also for\nfluid systems where simple isotropic potentials start to fail already for low\nto moderate packing fractions. Further, in describing these states it is\ncrucial to take into account the pronounced temperature dependence arising in\nselected pair configurations due to bending fluctuations.\n", "  We study the asymmetric six-vertex model in the quadrant with parameters on\nthe stochastic line. We show that the random height function of the model\nconverges to an explicit deterministic limit shape as the mesh size tends to 0.\nWe further prove that the one-point fluctuations around the limit shape are\nasymptotically governed by the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution. We also explain an\nequivalent formulation of our model as an interacting particle system, which\ncan be viewed as a discrete time generalization of ASEP started from the step\ninitial condition. Our results confirm an earlier prediction of Gwa and Spohn\n(1992) that this system belongs to the KPZ universality class.\n", "  Focused MeV ion microbeams are suitable tools for the direct writing of\nconductive graphitic channels buried in an insulating diamond bulk, as\ndemonstrated in previous works with the fabrication of multi-electrode ionizing\nradiation detectors and cellular biosensors. In this work we investigate the\nsuitability of the fabrication method for the electrical excitation of colour\ncentres in diamond. Differently from photoluminescence, electroluminescence\nrequires an electrical current flowing through the diamond sub-gap states for\nthe excitation of the colour centres. With this purpose, buried graphitic\nelectrodes with a spacing of 10 micrometers were fabricated in the bulk of a\ndetector-grade CVD single-crystal diamond sample using a scanning 1.8 MeV He\nmicro-beam. The current flowing in the gap region between the electrodes upon\nthe application of a 250 V bias voltage was exploited as the excitation pump\nfor the electroluminescence of different types of colour centres localized in\nthe above-mentioned gap. The bright light emission was spatially mapped using a\nconfocal optical microscopy setup. The spectral analysis of electroluminescence\nrevealed the emission from neutrally-charged nitrogen-vacancy centres ($NV^0$,\n$\\lambda_{ZPL}$ = 575 nm), as well as from cluster crystal dislocations\n(A-band, {\\lambda} = 400-500 nm). Moreover, an electroluminescence signal with\nappealing spectral features (sharp emission at room temperature, low phonon\nsidebands) from He-related defects was detected ($\\lambda_{ZPL}$ = 536.3 nm,\n$\\lambda_{ZPL}$ = 560.5 nm); a low and broad peak around {\\lambda} = 740 nm was\nalso observed and tentatively ascribed to Si-V or GR1 centres. These results\npose interesting future perspectives for the fabrication of\nelectrically-stimulated single-photon emitters in diamond for applications in\nquantum optics and quantum cryptography.\n", "  We consider the perturbed operator $H(b,V) := H(b,0) + V$, where $H(b,0)$ is\nthe $3$d Hamiltonian of Pauli with non-constant magnetic field, and $V$ is\n\\textit{a non-definite sign electric potential} decaying exponentially with\nrespect to the variable along the magnetic field. We prove that the only\nresonances of $H(b,V)$ near the low ground energy zero of $H(b,0)$ are its\neigenvalues and are concentrated in the semi axis $(-\\infty,0)$. Further, we\nestablish new asymptotic expansions, upper and lower bounds on their number\nnear zero.\n", "  In this paper, we rigorously investigate the truncation method for the Cauchy\nproblem of Helmholtz equations which is widely used to model propagation\nphenomena in physical applications. The method is a well-known approach to the\nregularization of several types of ill-posed problems, including the model\npostulated by Regi\\' nska and Regi\\' nski \\cite{RR06}. Under certain specific\nassumptions, we examine the ill-posedness of the non-homogeneous problem by\nexploring the representation of solutions based on Fourier mode. Then the\nso-called regularized solution is established with respect to a frequency\nbounded by an appropriate regularization parameter. Furthermore, we provide a\nshort analysis of the nonlinear forcing term. The main results show the\nstability as well as the strong convergence confirmed by the error estimates in\n$L^2$-norm of such regularized solutions. Besides, the regularization\nparameters are formulated properly. Finally, some illustrative examples are\nprovided to corroborate our qualitative analysis.\n", "  We consider a family of potentials f, derived from the Hofbauer potentials,\non the symbolic space Omega=\\{0,1\\}^\\mathbb{N} and the shift mapping $\\sigma$\nacting on it. A Ruelle operator framework is employed to show there is a phase\ntransition when the temperature varies in the following senses: the pressure is\nnot analytic, there are multiple eigenprobabilities for the dual of the Ruelle\noperator, the DLR-Gibbs measure is not unique and finally the Thermodynamic\nLimit is not unique. Additionally, we explicitly calculate the critical points\nfor these phase transitions. Some examples which are not of Hofbauer type are\nalso considered. The non-uniqueness of the Thermodynamic Limit is proved by\nconsidering a version of a Renewal Equation. We also show that the correlations\ndecay polynomially and that each one of these Hofbauer potentials is a fixed\npoint for a certain renormalization transformation.\n", "  The problem of localized states in 1D systems with the relativistic spectrum,\nnamely, graphene stripes and carbon nanotubes, has been analytically studied.\nThe bound state as a superposition of two chiral states is completely described\nby their relative phase which is the foundation of the variable phase method\n(VPM) developed herein. Basing on our VPM, we formulate and prove the\nrelativistic Levinson theorem. The problem of bound state can be reduced to the\nanalysis of closed trajectories of some vector field. Remarkably, the Levinson\ntheorem appears as the Poincare indices theorem for these closed trajectories.\nThe reduction of the VPM equation to the non-relativistic and semi-classical\nlimits has been done. The limit of the small momentum $p_y$ of the transverse\nquantization is applicable to arbitrary integrable potential. In this case the\nonly confined mode is predicted.\n", "  Weak vector-boson W,Z scattering at high energy probes the Higgs sector and\nis most sensitive to any new physics associated with electroweak symmetry\nbreaking. We show that in the presence of the 125 GeV Higgs boson, a\nconventional effective-theory analysis fails for this class of processes. We\npropose to extrapolate the effective-theory ansatz by an extension of the\nparameter-free K-matrix unitarization prescription, which we denote as direct\nT-matrix unitarization. We generalize this prescription to arbitrary\nnon-perturbative models and describe the implementation, as an asymptotically\nconsistent reference model matched to the low-energy effective theory. We\npresent exemplary numerical results for full six-fermion processes at the LHC.\n", "  We investigate the weak lensing effect by line-of-sight structures with a\nsurface mass density of <~10^8 solar mass/arcsec^2 in QSO-galaxy quadruple lens\nsystems. Using high-resolution N-body simulations in warm dark matter (WDM)\nmodels and observed four quadruple lenses that show anomalies in the flux\nratios, we obtain constraints on the mass of thermal WDM, m_WDM>= 1.3keV(95%CL)\nassuming that the density of the primary lens is described by a singular\nisothermal ellipsoid (SIE). The obtained constraint is consistent with those\nfrom Lyman-$\\alpha$ forests and the number counts of high-redshift galaxies at\nz>4. Our results show that WDM with a free-streaming comoving wavenumber k_{fs}\n<= 27 h/Mpc is disfavored as the major component of cosmological density at\nredshifts 0.5 <~ z <~ 4 provided that the SIE models describe the gravitational\npotentials of the primary lenses correctly.\n", "  Generalizing the L-Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (L-KS) kernel from our earlier work,\nwe give a novel explicit-kernel formulation useful for a large class of fourth\norder deterministic, stochastic, linear, and nonlinear PDEs in multispatial\ndimensions. These include pattern formation equations like the Swift-Hohenberg\nand many other prominent and new PDEs. We first establish existence,\nuniqueness, and sharp dimension-dependent spatio-temporal H\\\"older regularity\nfor the canonical (zero drift) L-KS SPDE, driven by white noise on\n$\\{\\Rp\\times\\Rd\\}_{d=1}^{3}$. The spatio-temporal H\\\"older exponents are\nexactly the same as the striking ones we proved for our recently introduced\nBrownian-time Brownian motion (BTBM) stochastic integral equation, associated\nwith time-fractional PDEs. The challenge here is that, unlike the positive BTBM\ndensity, the L-KS kernel is the Gaussian average of a modified, highly\noscillatory, and complex Schr\\\"odinger propagator. We use a combination of\nharmonic and delicate analysis to get the necessary estimates. Second,\nattaching order parameters $\\vepo$ to the L-KS spatial operator and $\\vept$ to\nthe noise term, we show that the dimension-dependent critical ratio\n$\\vept/\\vepo^{d/8}$ controls the limiting behavior of the L-KS SPDE, as\n$\\vepo,\\vept\\searrow0$; and we compare this behavior to that of the less\nregular second order heat SPDEs. Finally, we give a change-of-measure\nequivalence between the canonical L-KS SPDE and nonlinear L-KS SPDEs. In\nparticular, we prove uniqueness in law for the Swift-Hohenberg and the law\nequivalence---and hence the same H\\\"older regularity---of the Swift-Hohenberg\nSPDE and the canonical L-KS SPDE on compacts in one-to-three dimensions.\n", "  In quantum state redistribution as introduced in [Luo and Devetak (2009)] and\n[Devetak and Yard (2008)], there are four systems of interest: the $A$ system\nheld by Alice, the $B$ system held by Bob, the $C$ system that is to be\ntransmitted from Alice to Bob, and the $R$ system that holds a purification of\nthe state in the $ABC$ registers. We give upper and lower bounds on the amount\nof quantum communication and entanglement required to perform the task of\nquantum state redistribution in a one-shot setting. Our bounds are in terms of\nthe smooth conditional min- and max-entropy, and the smooth max-information.\nThe protocol for the upper bound has a clear structure, building on the work\n[Oppenheim (2008)]: it decomposes the quantum state redistribution task into\ntwo simpler quantum state merging tasks by introducing a coherent relay. In the\nindependent and identical (iid) asymptotic limit our bounds for the quantum\ncommunication cost converge to the quantum conditional mutual information\n$I(C:R|B)$, and our bounds for the total cost converge to the conditional\nentropy $H(C|B)$. This yields an alternative proof of optimality of these rates\nfor quantum state redistribution in the iid asymptotic limit. In particular, we\nobtain a strong converse for quantum state redistribution, which even holds\nwhen allowing for feedback.\n", "  The functional renormalization group (RG) in combination with Fermi surface\npatching is a well-established method for studying Fermi liquid instabilities\nof correlated electron systems. In this article, we further develop this method\nand combine it with mean-field theory to approach multiband systems with\nspin-orbit coupling, and we apply this to a tight-binding Rashba model with an\nattractive, local interaction. The spin dependence of the interaction vertex is\nfully implemented in a RG flow without SU(2) symmetry, and its momentum\ndependence is approximated in a refined projection scheme. In particular, we\ndiscuss the necessity of including in the RG flow contributions from both bands\nof the model, even if they are not intersected by the Fermi level. As the\nleading instability of the Rashba model, we find a superconducting phase with a\nsinglet-type interaction between electrons with opposite momenta. While the gap\nfunction has a singlet spin structure, the order parameter indicates an\nunconventional superconducting phase, with the ratio between singlet and\ntriplet amplitudes being plus or minus one on the Fermi lines of the upper or\nlower band, respectively. We expect our combined functional RG and mean-field\napproach to be useful for an unbiased theoretical description of the\nlow-temperature properties of spin-based materials.\n", "  Preliminary results from an ongoing project to compute a grid of post-AGB\nmodels is presented. Our preliminary results show that stellar evolution\ncomputations that include an updated treatment of the microphysics predict\npost-AGB timescales that are several times shorter that predicted by older\nmodels. Also the mass-luminosity relation of post-AGB models deviates from that\nof older grids. In addition, our results suggest only a slight metallicity\ndependence of the post-AGB timescales. We expect these results to have\nsignificant consequences for models of the formation of planetary nebulae and\ntheir luminosity function.\n", "  Bound states of 7-branes known as 'T-branes' have properties that defy usual\ngeometric intuition. For instance, the gauge group of n coincident branes may\nnot be U(n). More surprisingly, matter may show up at unexpected loci, such as\npoints. By analyzing T-branes of perturbative type IIB string theory in the\ntachyon condensation picture we gain the following insights: In a large class\nof models, the tachyon can be diagonalized even though the worldvolume Higgs\ncannot. In those cases, we see the structure of these bound states more\nmanifestly, thereby drastically simplifying analysis of gauge groups and\nspectra. Whenever the tachyon is not diagonalizable, matter localizes at\nunexpected loci, and we find that there is a lower-dimensional brane bound to\nthe 7-brane.\n", "  In this paper we calculate the strong field limit deflection angle for a\nlight ray passing near a scalar charged spherically symmetric object, described\nby a metric which comes from the low-energy limit of heterotic string theory.\nThen, we compare the expansion parameters of our results with those obtained in\nthe Einstein's canonical frame, obtained by a conformal transformation, and we\nshow that, at least at first order, the results do not agree.\n", "  We propose a framework for treating F-theory directly, without resolving or\ndeforming its singularities. This allows us to explore new sectors of gauge\ntheories, including exotic bound states such as T-branes, in a global context.\nWe use the mathematical framework known as Eisenbud's matrix factorizations for\nhypersurface singularities. We display the usefulness of this technique by way\nof examples, including affine singularities of both conifold and orbifold type,\nas well as a class of full-fledged compact elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau\nfourfolds.\n", "  The paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition is believed to proceed\nthrough a critical point, at which power laws and scaling invariance,\nassociated with the existence of one diverging characteristic length scale --\nthe so called correlation length -- appear. We indeed observe power laws and\nscaling behavior over extraordinarily many decades of the suitable scaling\nvariables at the paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition in ultrathin Fe\nfilms. However, we find that, when the putative critical point is approached,\nthe singular behavior of thermodynamic quantities transforms into an analytic\none: the critical point does not exist, it is replaced by a more complex phase\ninvolving domains of opposite magnetization, below as well as $above$ the\nputative critical temperature. All essential experimental results are\nreproduced by Monte-Carlo simulations in which, alongside the familiar exchange\ncoupling, the competing dipole-dipole interaction is taken into account. Our\nresults imply that a scaling behavior of macroscopic thermodynamic quantities\nis not necessarily a signature for an underlying second-order phase transition\nand that the paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition proceeds, very\nlikely, in the presence of at least two long spatial scales: the correlation\nlength and the size of magnetic domains.\n", "  The CoRoT and Kepler satellites were the first space platforms designed to\nperform high-precision photometry for a large number of stars. Multiple systems\ndisplay a wide variety of photometric variability, making them natural\nbenefactors of these missions. I review the work arising from CoRoT and Kepler\nobservations of multiple systems, with particular emphasis on eclipsing\nbinaries containing giant stars, pulsators, triple eclipses and/or low-mass\nstars. Many more results remain untapped in the data archives of these\nmissions, and the future holds the promise of K2, TESS and PLATO.\n", "  The empirical calculations of the prompt neutrons average number for\nphotofission of the 232Th, 233U, 234U, 235U, 236U, 238U, 237Np, 239Pu and 241Am\nactinides has been done as a function of photon energy, mass and charge of the\nnuclei, which can be used to evaluate the average number for photo-fission of\nnuclides for which no or scarce data are available.\n", "  Detached eclipsing binary star systems are our primary source of measured\nphysical properties of normal stars. I introduce DEBCat: a catalogue of\ndetached eclipsing binaries with mass and radius measurements to the 2%\nprecision necessary to put useful constraints on theoretical models of stellar\nevolution. The catalogue was begun in 2006, as an update of the compilation by\nAndersen (1991). It now contains over 170 systems, and new results are added on\nappearance in the refereed literature. DEBCat is available at:\nhttp://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/jkt/debcat/\n", "  It is shown that the well-known disparity in classical electrodynamics\nbetween the power losses calculated from the radiation reaction and that from\nLarmor's formula, is succinctly understood when a proper distinction is made\nbetween quantities expressed in terms of a \"real time\" and those expressed in\nterms of a retarded time. It is explicitly shown that an accelerated charge,\ntaken to be a sphere of vanishingly small radius $r_{\\rm o} $, experiences at\nany time a self-force proportional to the acceleration it had at a time $r_{\\rm\no} /c$ earlier, while the rate of work done on the charge is obtained by a\nscalar product of the self-force with the instantaneous (present) value of its\nvelocity. Now if the retarded value of acceleration is expressed in terms of\nthe present values of acceleration, then we get the rate of work done according\nto the radiation reaction equation, however if we instead express the present\nvalue of velocity in terms of its time-retarded value, then we get back the\nfamiliar Larmor's radiation formula. From this simple relation between the two\nwe show that they differ because Larmor's formula, in contrast with the\nradiation reaction, is written not in terms of the real-time values of\nquantities specifying the charge motion but is instead expressed in terms of\nthe time-retarded values. Moreover, it is explicitly shown that the difference\nin the two formulas for radiative power loss exactly matches the difference in\nthe temporal rate of the change of energy in the self-fields between the\nretarded and real times. From this it becomes obvious that the ad hoc\nintroduction of an acceleration-dependent energy term, usually referred to in\nthe prevalent literature as Schott-term, in order to make the two formulas\ncomply with each other, is redundant.\n", "  We develop a high frequency, wide bandwidth radiometer operating at room\ntemperature, which augments the traditional technique of Johnson noise\nthermometry for nanoscale thermal transport studies. Employing low noise\namplifiers and an analog multiplier operating at 2~GHz, auto- and\ncross-correlated Johnson noise measurements are performed in the temperature\nrange of 3 to 300~K, achieving a sensitivity of 5.5~mK (110 ppm) in 1 second of\nintegration time. This setup allows us to measure the thermal conductance of a\nboron nitride encapsulated monolayer graphene device over a wide temperature\nrange. Our data shows a high power law (T$^{\\sim4}$) deviation from the\nWiedemann-Franz law above T$\\sim$100~K.\n", "  In this paper, we explore classes of irrotational-fluid cosmological models\nin the context of f(R)-gravity in an attempt to put some theoretical and\nmathematical restrictions on the form of the f(R) gravitational Lagrangian. In\nparticular, we investigate the consistency of linearised dust models for\nshear-free cases as well as in the limiting cases when either the\ngravito-magnetic or gravito-elecric components of the Weyl tensor vanish. We\nalso discuss the existence and consistency of classes of non-expanding\nirrotational spacetimes in f(R)-gravity.\n", "  The combined considerations of both the bulk liquid-drop-type behavior and\nthe quantized aligned rotation with cranked Skyrme-Hartree-Fock approach\nrevealed previously [Phys. Lett. B 738 (2014) 401] that even-even, N=Z,\ntoroidal high-spin isomeric states have general occurrences for light nuclei\nwith A between 28 and 52. We find that in this mass region there are in\naddition N not equal to Z toroidal high-spin isomers when the single-particle\nshells for neutrons and protons occur at the same cranked frequency $\\hbar\n\\omega$. Examples of N not equal to Z toroidal high-spin isomers,\n$^{36}_{16}$S$_{20}$($I$=74$\\hbar$) and\n$^{40}_{18}$Ar$_{22}$($I$=80,102$\\hbar$), are located and examined. The\nsystematic properties of these N not equal to Z toroidal high-spin isomers fall\ninto the same regular (muti-particle)-(muti-hole) patterns as other N=Z\ntoroidal high-spin isomers.\n", "  We study the effect of stimulated photon emission from the vacuum in strong\nspace-time-dependent electromagnetic fields. We emphasize the viewpoint that\nthe vacuum subjected to macroscopic electromagnetic fields with at least one\nnonzero electromagnetic field invariant, as, e.g., attainable by superimposing\ntwo laser beams, can represent a source term for outgoing photons. We believe\nthat this view is particularly intuitive and allows for a straightforward and\nintuitive study of optical signatures of quantum vacuum nonlinearity in\nrealistic experiments involving the collision of high-intensity laser pulses,\nand exemplify this view for the vacuum subjected to a strong standing\nelectromagnetic wave as generated in the focal spot of two counterpropagating,\nlinearly polarized, high-intensity laser pulses. Focusing on a comparably\nsimple electromagnetic field profile, which should nevertheless capture the\nessential features of the electromagnetic fields generated in the focal spots\nof real high-intensity laser beams, we provide estimates for emission\ncharacteristics and the numbers of emitted photons attainable with present and\nnear future high-intensity laser facilities.\n", "  Quantum dots are nanoscopic systems, where carriers are confined in all three\nspatial directions. Such nanoscopic systems are suitable for fundamental\nstudies of quantum mechanics and are candidates for applications such as\nquantum information processing. It was also proposed that linear arrangements\nof quantum dots could be used as quantum cascade laser. In this work we study\nthe impact of electron-electron interactions on transport in a spinful serial\ntriple quantum dot system weakly coupled to two leads. We find that due to\nelectron-electron scattering processes the transport is enabled beyond the\ncommon single-particle transmission channels. This shows that the scenario in\nthe serial quantum dots intrinsically deviates from layered structures such as\nquantum cascade lasers, where the presence of well-defined single-particle\nresonances between neighboring levels are crucial for device operation.\nAdditionally, we check the validity of the Pauli master equation by comparing\nit with the first-order von Neumann approach. Here we demonstrate that\ncoherences are of relevance if the energy spacing of the eigenstates is smaller\nthan the lead transition rate multiplied by $\\hbar$.\n", "  Exact solutions to the Einstein field equations may be generated from already\nexisting ones (seed solutions), that admit at least one Killing vector. In this\nframework, a space of potentials is introduced. By the use of symmetries in\nthis space, the set of potentials associated to a known solution are\ntransformed into a new set, either by continuous transformations or by discrete\ntransformations. In view of this method, and upon consideration of continuous\ntransformations, we arrive at some exact, stationary axisymmetric solutions to\nthe Einstein field equations in vacuum, that may be of geometrical or/and\nphysical interest.\n", "  Following the Poincare algebra for a free spinning particle and using the\nCasimirs of the algebra in the Hamiltonian approach, we construct\nsystematically a set of Lagrangians for the relativistic spinning particle\nwhich includes the Lagrangian given in the literature. Then we analyze the\ndynamics of this generalized system in the Lagrangian formulation and show that\nthe equations of motion support an oscillatory solution corresponding to the\nspinning nature of the system. Next we analyze the canonical structure of the\nsystem and present the correct gauge suitable for the spinning motion of the\nsystem.\n", "  Modern problems in astronomical Bayesian inference require efficient methods\nfor sampling from complex, high-dimensional, often multi-modal probability\ndistributions. Most popular methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling,\nperform poorly on strongly multi-modal probability distributions, rarely\njumping between modes or settling on just one mode without finding others.\nParallel tempering addresses this problem by sampling simultaneously with\nseparate Markov chains from tempered versions of the target distribution with\nreduced contrast levels. Gaps between modes can be traversed at higher\ntemperatures, while individual modes can be efficiently explored at lower\ntemperatures. In this paper, we investigate how one might choose the ladder of\ntemperatures to achieve more efficient sampling, as measured by the\nautocorrelation time of the sampler. In particular, we present a simple,\neasily-implemented algorithm for dynamically adapting the temperature\nconfiguration of a sampler while sampling. This algorithm dynamically adjusts\nthe temperature spacing to achieve a uniform rate of exchanges between chains\nat neighbouring temperatures. We compare the algorithm to conventional\ngeometric temperature configurations on a number of test distributions and on\nan astrophysical inference problem, reporting efficiency gains by a factor of\n1.2-2.5 over a well-chosen geometric temperature configuration and by a factor\nof 1.5-5 over a poorly chosen configuration. On all of these problems a sampler\nusing the dynamical adaptations to achieve uniform acceptance ratios between\nneighbouring chains outperforms one that does not.\n", "  A measurement of the ratio of the branching fractions of the B[0,s] meson to\nJ/psi f0(980) and to J/psi phi(1020) is presented. The J/psi, f0(980), and\nphi(1020) are observed through their decays to mu+ mu-, pi+ pi-, and K+ K-,\nrespectively. The f0 is identified by requiring abs( M[pi+,pi-] - 974 MeV ) <\n50 MeV. The analysis is based on a data sample of pp collisions at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment, corresponding\nto an integrated luminosity of 5.3 inverse femtobarns. The measured ratio is\nB(B[0,s] to J/psi f0(980)) B(f0 to pi+ pi-) / B(B[0,s] to J/psi phi(1020))\nB(phi(1020) to K+ K-) = 0.140 +/- 0.008 +/- 0.023, where the first uncertainty\nis statistical and the second is systematic.\n", "  Searches for the role of spin in gravitation dated before the firm\nestablishment of the electron spin in 1925. Since mass and spin, or helicity in\nthe case of zero mass, are the Casimir invariants of the Poincar\\'e group and\nmass participates in universal gravitation, these searches are natural steps to\npursue. In this update, we report on the progress on this topic in the last\nfive years after our last review. We begin with how is Lorentz/Poincar\\'e group\nin local physics arisen from spacetime structure as seen by photon and matter\nthrough experiments/observations. The cosmic verification of the Galileo\nEquivalence Principle for photons/electromagnetic wave packets (Universality of\nPropagation in spacetime independent of photon energy and polarization, i.e.\nnonbirefringence) constrains the spacetime constitutive tensor to high\nprecision to a core metric form with an axion degree and a dilaton degree of\nfreedom. Hughes-Drever-type experiments then constrain this core metric to\nagree with the matter metric. Thus comes the metric with axion and dilation. In\nlocal physics this metric gives the Lorentz/Poincar\\'e covariance. Constraints\non axion and dilaton from polarized/unpolarized laboratory/astrophysical/cosmic\nexperiments/observations are presented. In the end, we review the theoretical\nprogress on the issue of gyrogravitational ratio for fundamental particles and\nthe experimental progress on the measurements of possible long\nrange/intermediate range spin-spin, spin-monopole and spin-cosmos interactions.\n", "  We propose an efficient four-intensity decoy-state BB84 protocol and derive\nconcise security bounds for this protocol with the universally composable\nfinite-key analysis method. Comparing with the efficient three-intensity\nprotocol, we find that our efficient four-intensity protocol can increase the\nsecret key rate by at least $30\\%$. Particularly, this increasing rate of\nsecret key rate will be raised as the transmission distance increases. At a\nlarge transmission distance, our efficient four-intensity protocol can improve\nthe performance of quantum key distribution profoundly.\n", "  Repeated measurements as typically occurring in two- or multi-time\ncorrelators rely on von Neumann's projection postulate, telling how to restart\nthe system after an intermediate measurement. We invoke the principle of\ndeferred measurement to describe an alternative procedure where co-evolving\nquantum memories extract system information through entanglement, combined with\na final readout of the memories described by Born's rule. The new approach to\nrepeated quantum measurements respects the unitary evolution of quantum\nmechanics during intermediate times, unifies the treatment of strong and weak\nmeasurements, and reproduces the projected and (anti-) symmetrized correlators\nin the two limits. As an illustration, we apply our formalism to the\ncalculation of the electron charge correlator in a mesoscopic physics setting,\nwhere single electron pulses assume the role of flying memory qubits. We\npropose an experimental setup which reduces the measurement of the time\ncorrelator to the measurement of currents and noise, exploiting the (pulsed)\ninjection of electrons to cope with the challenge of performing short-time\nmeasurements.\n", "  We present the properties of the first 250 $\\mu$m blind sample of nearby\ngalaxies (15 < D < 46 Mpc) containing 42 objects from the Herschel\nAstrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS). Herschel's sensitivity\nprobes the faint end of the dust luminosity function for the first time,\nspanning a range of stellar mass (7.4 < log$_{10}$ M$_{\\star}$ < 11.3\nM$_{\\odot}$), star formation activity (-11.8 < log$_{10}$ SSFR < -8.9\nyr$^{-1}$), gas fraction (3-96 per cent), and colour (0.6 < FUV-Ks < 7.0 mag).\nThe median cold dust temperature is 14.6 K, colder than in the Herschel\nReference Survey (18.5 K) and Planck Early Release Compact Source Catalogue\n17.7 K. The mean dust-to-stellar mass ratio in our sample is higher than these\nsurveys by factors of 3.7 and 1.8, with a dust mass volume density of (3.7\n$\\pm$ 0.7) x 10$^{5}$ M$_{\\odot}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. Counter-intuitively, we find that\nthe more dust rich a galaxy, the lower its UV attenuation. Over half of our\ndust-selected sample are very blue in FUV-Ks colour, with irregular and/or\nhighly flocculent morphology, these galaxies account for only 6 per cent of the\nsample's stellar mass but contain over 35 per cent of the dust mass. They are\nthe most actively star forming galaxies in the sample, with the highest gas\nfractions and lowest UV attenuation. They also appear to be in an early stage\nof converting their gas into stars, providing valuable insights into the\nchemical evolution of young galaxies.\n", "  Analytical forces have been derived in the Lagrangian framework for several\nrandom phase approximation (RPA) correlated total energy methods based on the\nrange separated hybrid (RSH) approach, which combines a short-range density\nfunctional approximation for the short-range exchange-correlation energy with a\nHartree-Fock-type long-range exchange and RPA long-range correlation. The RPA\ncorrelation energy has been expressed as a ring coupled cluster doubles (rCCD)\ntheory. The resulting analytical gradients have been implemented and tested for\ngeometry optimization of simple molecules and intermolecular charge transfer\ncomplexes, where intermolecular interactions are expected to have a\nnon-negligible effect even on geometrical parameters of the monomers.\n", "  We analyze the origin of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in fluorinated graphene\nusing Density Functional Theory (DFT) and a tight-binding model for the\nrelevant orbitals. As it turns out, the dominant source of SOC is the atomic\nspin-orbit of fluorine adatoms and not the impurity induced SOC based on the\ndistortion of the graphene plane as in hydrogenated graphene. More\ninterestingly, our DFT calculations show that SOC is strongly affected by both\nthe type and concentrations of the graphene's carriers, being enhanced by\nelectron doping and reduced by hole doping. This effect is due to the charge\ntransfer to the fluorine adatom and the consequent change in the\nfluorine-carbon bonding. Our simple tight-binding model, that includes the SOC\nof the $2p$ orbitals of F and effective parameters based on maximally localized\nWannier functions, is able to account for the effect. The strong enhancement of\nthe SOC induced by graphene doping opens the possibility to tune the spin\nrelaxation in this material.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to investigate spectral and photometric properties\nof 854 faint ($i_{AB}$<~25 mag) star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at 2<z<2.5 using\nthe VIMOS Ultra-Deep Survey (VUDS) spectroscopic data and deep multi-wavelength\nphotometric data in three extensively studied extragalactic fields (ECDFS,\nVVDS, COSMOS). These SFGs were targeted for spectroscopy based on their\nphotometric redshifts. The VUDS spectra are used to measure the UV spectral\nslopes ($\\beta$) as well as Ly$\\alpha$ equivalent widths (EW). On average, the\nspectroscopically measured $\\beta$ (-1.36$\\pm$0.02), is comparable to the\nphotometrically measured $\\beta$ (-1.32$\\pm$0.02), and has smaller measurement\nuncertainties. The positive correlation of $\\beta$ with the Spectral Energy\nDistribution (SED)-based measurement of dust extinction, E$_{\\rm s}$(B-V),\nemphasizes the importance of $\\beta$ as an alternative dust indicator at high\nredshifts. To make a proper comparison, we divide these SFGs into three\nsubgroups based on their rest-frame Ly$\\alpha$ EW: SFGs with no Ly$\\alpha$\nemission (SFG$_{\\rm N}$; EW$\\le$0\\AA), SFGs with Ly$\\alpha$ emission (SFG$_{\\rm\nL}$; EW$>$0\\AA), and Ly$\\alpha$ emitters (LAEs; EW$\\ge$20\\AA). The fraction of\nLAEs at these redshifts is $\\sim$10%, which is consistent with previous\nobservations. We compared best-fit SED-estimated stellar parameters of the\nSFG$_{\\rm N}$, SFG$_{\\rm L}$ and LAE samples. For the luminosities probed here\n($\\sim$L$^*$), we find that galaxies with and without Ly$\\alpha$ in emission\nhave small but significant differences in their SED-based properties. We find\nthat LAEs have less dust, and lower star-formation rates (SFR) compared to\nnon-LAEs. We also find that LAEs are less massive compared to non-LAEs, though\nthe difference is smaller and less significant compared to the SFR and E$_{\\rm\ns}$(B-V). [abridged]\n", "  This paper describes a tool, the Guided Reflection Form (GRF), which was used\nto promote reflection in a modeling-based physics course. Each week, students\ncompleted a guided reflection and received feedback from their instructors.\nThese activities were intended to help students become better at the process of\nreflection, developing skills that they could apply in their future learning.\nWe analyzed student reflections: (1) to provide insight into the reflection\nprocess itself and (2) to describe common themes in student reflections. Most\nstudents were able to use the GRF to reflect on their learning in meaningful\nways. Moreover, the themes present in student reflections provide insights into\nstruggles commonly faced by physics students. We discuss the design of the GRF\nin detail, so that others may use it as a tool to support student reflections.\n", "  We assemble a sample of 24 hydrogen-poor super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe).\nParameterizing the light curve shape through rise and decline timescales shows\nthat the two are highly correlated. Magnetar-powered models can reproduce the\ncorrelation, with the diversity in rise and decline rates driven by the\ndiffusion timescale. Circumstellar interaction models can exhibit a similar\nrise-decline relation, but only for a narrow range of densities, which may be\nproblematic for these models. We find that SLSNe are approximately 3.5\nmagnitudes brighter and have light curves 3 times broader than SNe Ibc, but\nthat the intrinsic shapes are similar. There are a number of SLSNe with\nparticularly broad light curves, possibly indicating two progenitor channels,\nbut statistical tests do not cleanly separate two populations. The general\nspectral evolution is also presented. Velocities measured from Fe II are\nsimilar for SLSNe and SNe Ibc, suggesting that diffusion time differences are\ndominated by mass or opacity. Flat velocity evolution in most SLSNe suggests a\ndense shell of ejecta. If opacities in SLSNe are similar to other SNe Ibc, the\naverage ejected mass is higher by a factor 2-3. Assuming\n$\\kappa=0.1\\,$cm$^2\\,$g$^{-1}$, we estimate a mean (median) SLSN ejecta mass of\n10$\\,$M$_\\odot$ (6$\\,$M$_\\odot$), with a range of 3-30$\\,$M$_\\odot$. Doubling\nthe assumed opacity brings the masses closer to normal SNe Ibc, but with a\nhigh-mass tail. The most probable mechanism for generating SLSNe seems to be\nthe core-collapse of a very massive hydrogen-poor star, forming a millisecond\nmagnetar.\n", "  We investigate the properties of inner and outer horizon thermodynamics of\nSen black hole(BH) both in \\emph{Einstein frame(EF)} and \\emph{string\nframe(SF)}. We also compute area(or entropy) product, area(or entropy) sum of\nthe said BH in EF as well as SF. In the EF, we observe that the area(or\nentropy) product is \\emph{ universal}, whereas area (or entropy) sum is\n\\emph{not} universal. On the other hand, in the SF, area(or entropy) product\nand area(or entropy) sum don't have any universal behavior because they all are\ndepends on ADM(Arnowitt-Deser-Misner) mass parameter. We also verify that the\n\\emph{first law} is satisfied at the Cauchy horizon(CH) as well as event\nhorizon(EH). In addition, we also compute other thermodynamic products and sums\nin the EF as well as in the SF. We further compute the \\emph{Smarr mass\nformula} and \\emph{Christodoulou's irreducible mass formula} for Sen BH.\nMoreover, we compute the area bound and entropy bound for both the horizons.\nThe upper area bound for EH is actually the Penrose like inequality, which is\nthe first geometric inequality in BHs. Furthermore, we compute the central\ncharges of the left and right moving sectors of the dual CFT in Sen/CFT\ncorrespondence using thermodynamic relations. These thermodynamic relations on\nthe multi-horizons give us further understanding the microscopic nature of BH\nentropy(both interior and exterior).\n", "  We propose an implementation of quantum neural networks using an array of\nquantum dots with dipole-dipole interactions. We demonstrate that this\nimplementation is both feasible and versatile by studying it within the\nframework of GaAs based quantum dot qubits coupled to a reservoir of acoustic\nphonons. Using numerically exact Feynman integral calculations, we have found\nthat the quantum coherence in our neural networks survive for over a hundred ps\neven at liquid nitrogen temperatures (77 K), which is three orders of magnitude\nhigher than current implementations which are based on SQUID-based systems\noperating at temperatures in the mK range.\n", "  The relic abundance of asymmetric Dark Matter particles in the scalar--tensor\nmodel is analysized in this article. We extend the numeric and analytic\ncalculation of the relic density of the asymmetric Dark Matter in the standard\ncosmological scenario to the nonstandard cosmological scenario. We focus on the\nscalar--tensor model. Hubble expansion rate is changed in the nonstandard\ncosmological scenario. This leaves its imprint on the relic density of Dark\nMatter particles. In this article we investigate to what extent the asymmetric\nDark Matter particle's relic density is changed in the scalar--tensor model. We\nuse the observed present day Dark Matter abundance to find the constraints on\nthe parameter space in this model.\n", "  We show that \"spiralized\" models of new-inflation can be experimentally\nidentified mostly by their positive spectral running in direct contrast with\nmost chaotic-inflation models which have negative runnings typically in the\nrange of $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-4}-10^{-3})$.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of the exciton binding energy for anisotropic\ntwo-dimensional crystals. We obtain analytical expressions from variational\nwave functions in different limits of the screening length to exciton size\nratio and compare them with numerical solutions, both variational and exact. As\nan example, we apply these results to phosphorene, a monolayer of black\nphosphorous. Aided by density functional theory calculations for the evaluation\nof the two-dimensional polarizability, our analytical solution for the exciton\nbinding energy gives a result which is very close to the numerical ones and, in\nturn, is comparable to the experimental value, as recently reported.\n", "  We investigate the properties of halo gas using three cosmological `zoom-in'\nsimulations of realistic Milky Way-galaxy analogs with varying sub-grid\nphysics. In all three cases, the mass of hot ($T > 10^6$ K) halo gas is $\\sim\n1\\%$ of the host's virial mass. The X-ray luminosity of two of the runs is\nconsistent with observations of the Milky Way, while the third simulation is\nX-ray bright and resembles more closely a very massive, star-forming spiral.\nHot halos extend to 140 kpc from the galactic center and are surrounded by a\nbubble of warm-hot ($T = 10^5 - 10^6$K) gas that extends to the virial radius.\nSimulated halos agree well outside 20-30 kpc with the $\\beta$-model of Miller &\nBregman (2013) based on OVII absorption and OVIII emission measurements.\nWarm--hot and hot gas contribute up to $80\\%$ of the total gas reservoir, and\ncontain nearly the same amount of baryons as the stellar component. The mass of\nwarm-hot and hot components falls into the range estimated for $L^*$ galaxies.\nWith key observational constraints on the density of the Milky Way corona being\nsatisfied, we show that concealing of the ubiquitous warm-hot baryons, along\nwith the ejection of just $20-30 \\%$ of the diffuse gas out of the potential\nwells by supernova-driven outflows, can solve the \"missing baryon problem\". The\nrecovered baryon fraction within 3 virial radii is $90\\%$ of the universal\nvalue. With a characteristic density of $\\sim 10^{-4}$ cm$^{-3}$ at $50-80$\nkpc, diffuse coronae meet the requirement for fast and complete ram--pressure\nstripping of the gas reservoirs in dwarf galaxy satellites.\n", "  Organic-inorganic hybrid halide perovskites, in which the A cations of an\nABX$_3$ perovskite are replaced by organic cations, may be used for\nphotovoltaic and solar thermoelectric applications. In this contribution, we\nsystematically study three lead-free hybrid perovskites, i.e., methylammonium\ntin iodide CH$_3$NH$_3$SnI$_3$, ammonium tin iodide NH$_4$SnI$_3$, and\nformamidnium tin iodide HC(NH$_2$)$_2$SnI$_3$, by first-principles\ncalculations. We find that in addition to the commonly known motif in which the\ncorner-shared SnI$_6$ octahedra form a three-dimensional network, these\nmaterials may also favor a two-dimensional (layered) motif formed by\nalternating layers of the SnI$_6$ octahedra and the organic cations. These two\nmotifs are nearly equal in free energy and are separated by low barriers. These\nlayered structures features many flat electronic bands near the band edges,\nmaking their electronic structures significantly different from those of the\nstructural phases composed of three-dimension networks of SnI$_6$ octahedra.\nFurthermore, because the electronic structures of HC(NH$_2$)$_2$SnI$_3$ are\nfound to be rather similar to those of CH$_3$NH$_3$SnI$_3$, formamidnium tin\niodide may also be promising for the applications of methylammonium tin iodide.\n", "  We present measurements of both scale- and time-dependent deviations from the\nstandard gravitational field equations. These late-time modifications are\nintroduced separately for relativistic and non-relativistic particles, by way\nof the parameters $G_{\\rm matter}(k,z)$ and $G_{\\rm light}(k,z)$ using two bins\nin both scale and time, with transition wavenumber $0.01$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and\nredshift 1. We emphasize the use of two dynamical probes to constrain this set\nof parameters, galaxy power spectrum multipoles and the direct peculiar\nvelocity power spectrum, which probe fluctuations on different scales. The\nmultipole measurements are derived from the WiggleZ and BOSS Data Release 11\nCMASS galaxy redshift surveys and the velocity power spectrum is measured from\nthe velocity sub-sample of the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey. We combine with\nadditional cosmological probes including baryon acoustic oscillations, Type Ia\nSNe, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), lensing of the CMB, and the\ntemperature--galaxy cross-correlation. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo\nlikelihood analysis, we find the inferred best-fit parameter values of $G_{\\rm\nmatter}(k,z)$ and $G_{\\rm light}(k,z)$ to be consistent with the standard model\nat the $95\\%$ confidence level. Furthermore, accounting for the\nAlcock-Paczynski effect, we perform joint fits for the expansion history and\ngrowth index gamma; we measure $\\gamma = 0.665 \\pm 0.0669$ ($68\\%$ C.L) for a\nfixed expansion history, and $\\gamma = 0.73^{+0.08}_{-0.10}$ ($68\\%$ C.L) when\nthe expansion history is allowed to deviate from $\\Lambda$CDM. With a fixed\nexpansion history the inferred value is consistent with GR at the $95\\%$ C.L;\nalternatively, a $2\\sigma$ tension is observed when the expansion history is\nnot fixed, this tension is worsened by the combination of growth and SNe data.\n", "  Galaxies that are being stripped of their gas can sometimes be recognized\nfrom their optical appearance. Extreme examples of stripped galaxies are the\nso-called ``jellyfish galaxies'', that exhibit tentacles of debris material\nwith a characteristic jellyfish morphology. We have conducted the first\nsystematic search for galaxies that are being stripped of their gas at low-z\n(z=0.04-0.07) in different environments, selecting galaxies with varying\ndegrees of morphological evidence for stripping. We have visually inspected B\nand V-band images and identified 344 candidates in 71 galaxy clusters of the\nOMEGAWINGS+WINGS sample and 75 candidates in groups and lower mass structures\nin the PM2GC sample. We present the atlas of stripping candidates and a first\nanalysis of their environment and their basic properties, such as morphologies,\nstar formation rates and galaxy stellar masses. Candidates are found in all\nclusters and at all clustercentric radii, and their number does not correlate\nwith the cluster velocity dispersion sigma or X-ray luminosity L_X.\nInterestingly, convincing cases of candidates are also found in groups and\nlower mass haloes (10^{11}-10^{14} M_{sun}), although the physical mechanism at\nwork needs to be securely identified. All the candidates are disky, have\nstellar masses ranging from log M/M_{sun} < 9 to > 11.5 and the majority of\nthem form stars at a rate that is on average a factor of 2 higher (2.5 sigma)\ncompared to non-stripped galaxies of similar mass. The few post-starburst and\npassive candidates have weak stripping evidence. We conclude that the stripping\nphenomenon is ubiquitous in clusters and could be present even in groups and\nlow mass haloes. Further studies will reveal the physics of the gas stripping\nand clarify the mechanisms at work.\n", "  The behaviour of a relativistic scalar particle subject to a scalar potential\nunder the effects of the violation of the Lorentz symmetry in the cosmic string\nspacetime is discussed. It is considered two possible scenarios of the Lorentz\nsymmetry breaking in the CPT-even gauge sector of the Standard Model Extension\ndefined by a tensor $\\left(K_{F}\\right)_{\\mu\\nu\\alpha\\beta}$. Then, by\nintroducing a scalar potential as a modification of the mass term of the\nKlein-Gordon equation, it is shown that the Klein-Gordon equation in the cosmic\nstring spacetime is modified by the effects of the Lorentz symmetry violation\nbackgrounds and bound state solution to the Klein-Gordon equation can be\nobtained.\n", "  We consider a string model at one-loop related to a $\\sigma$-model whose\nantisymmetric tensor field is constructed as complex structure on the\nbackground manifold, specially on a manifold $R\\times N$ where $N$ is a complex\nmanifold. As an example, we consider a homogeneous anisotropic\n$(1+4)$-dimensional $\\sigma$-model where space part of the background is a\n$4$-dimensional complex manifold. By solving the related one-loop\n$\\beta$-functions we obtain a static solution so that by reduction of this\nsolution to $(1+3)$-dimension we obtain a static solution of Einstein equation\nwhere the matter sector is effectively interpreted as an inhomogeneous,\nanisotropic and barotropic matter satisfying all the energy conditions.\nFinally, the $T$-dual background of the solution is investigated and it is\nshown that the duality transformation and reduction processes commute with each\nother.\n", "  We propose a new semi empirical expression of the virial coefficients for a\nhard sphere fluid which is valid in the disordered phase over the whole density\nrange. The results are in good agreement with the numerical data and better\nthan those of the well-known Carnahan & Starling equation of state in the\ndomain of validity of the later; moreover this new expression accounts for the\nsingularity which is required for the equation of state at the close random\npacking limit.\n", "  In multiplex networks with a large number of layers, the nodes can have\ndifferent activities, indicating the total number of layers in which the nodes\nare present. Here we model multiplex networks with heterogeneous activity of\nthe nodes and we study their robustness properties. We introduce a percolation\nmodel where nodes need to belong to the giant component only on the layers\nwhere they are active (i.e. their degree on that layer is larger than zero). We\nshow that when there are enough nodes active only in one layer, the multiplex\nbecomes more resilient and the transition becomes continuous. We find that\nmultiplex networks with a power-law distribution of node activities are more\nfragile if the distribution of activity is broader. We also show that while\npositive correlations between node activity and degree can enhance the\nrobustness of the system, the phase transition may become discontinuous, making\nthe system highly unpredictable.\n", "  Motivated by the space of spinors on a Lorentzian manifold, we define Krein\nspectral triples, which generalise spectral triples from Hilbert spaces to\nKrein spaces. This Krein space approach allows for an improved formulation of\nthe fermionic action for almost-commutative manifolds. We show by explicit\ncalculation that this action functional recovers the correct Lagrangians for\nthe cases of electrodynamics, the electro-weak theory, and the Standard Model.\nThe description of these examples does not require a real structure, unless one\nincludes Majorana masses, in which case the internal spaces also exhibit a\nKrein space structure.\n", "  Historically, the element of uncertainty in quantum mechanics has been\nexpressed through mathematical identities called uncertainty relations, a great\nmany of which continue to be discovered. These relations use diverse measures\nto quantify uncertainty (and joint uncertainty). In this paper we use\noperational information-theoretic principles to identify the common essence of\nall such measures, thereby defining measure-independent notions of uncertainty\nand joint uncertainty. We find that most existing entropic uncertainty\nrelations use measures of joint uncertainty that yield themselves to a small\nclass of operational interpretations. Our notion relaxes this restriction,\nrevealing previously unexplored joint uncertainty measures. To illustrate the\nutility of our formalism, we derive an uncertainty relation based on one such\nnew measure. We also use our formalism to gain insight into the conditions\nunder which measure-independent uncertainty relations can be found.\n", "  We examine in detail the cosmology based on quantal (Bohmian) trajectories as\nsuggested in a recent study arXiv:1404.3093[gr-qc]. We disagree with the\nconclusions regarding predicting the value of the cosmological constant\n$\\Lambda$ and evading the big bang singularity. Furthermore, we show that the\napproach of using a quantum corrected Raychaudhuri equation (QRE), as suggested\nin arXiv:1404.3093[gr-qc], is unsatisfactory, because, essentially, it uses the\nRaychaudhuri equation, which is a kinematical equation, in order to predict\ndynamics. In addition, even within this inconsistent framework, the authors\nhave adopted unjustified assumptions and carried out incorrect steps leading to\ndoubtful conclusions.\n", "  Classical bulges in spiral galaxies are known to rotate but the origin of\nthis observed rotational motion is not well understood. It has been shown\nrecently that a low-mass classical bulge (ClB) in a barred galaxy can acquire\nrotation from absorbing a significant fraction of the angular momentum emitted\nby the bar. Our aim here is to investigate whether bars can spin up also more\nmassive ClBs during the secular evolution of the bar, and to study the\nkinematics and dynamics of these ClBs. We use a set of self-consistent N-body\nsimulations to study the interaction of ClBs with a bar that forms\nself-consistently in the disk. We use orbital spectral analysis to investigate\nthe angular momentum gain by the classical bulge stars. We show that the ClBs\ngain, on average, about 2 - 6% of the disk's initial angular momentum within\nthe bar region. Most of this angular momentum gain occurs via low-order\nresonances, particularly 5:2 resonant orbits. A density wake forms in the ClB\nwhich corotates and aligns with the bar at the end of the evolution. The\nspin-up process creates a characteristic linear rotation profile and mild\ntangential anisotropy in the ClB. The induced rotation is small in the centre\nbut significant beyond $\\sim2$ bulge half mass radii, where it leads to\nmass-weighted $V/\\sigma \\sim 0.2$, and reaches a local $V_{max}/\\sigma_{in}\n\\sim 0.5$ at around the scale of the bar. The resulting $V/\\sigma$ is tightly\ncorrelated with the ratio of the bulge size to the bar size. In all models, a\nbox/peanut bulge forms suggesting that composite bulges may be common.\nBar-bulge resonant interaction in barred galaxies can provide some spin up of\nmassive ClBs, but the process appears to be less efficient than for low-mass\nClBs. Further angular momentum transfer due to nuclear bars or gas inflow would\nbe required to explain the observed rotation if it is not primordial.\n", "  Assuming the possibility of existence of a supercivilization we extend the\nidea of Freeman Dyson considering pulsars instead of stars. It is shown that\ninstead of a spherical shell the supercivilization must use ring-like\nconstructions. We have found that a size of the \"ring\" should be of the order\nof $(10^{-4}-10^{-1})$AU with temperature interval $(300-600)$K for relatively\nslowly rotating pulsars and $(10-350)$AU with temperature interval $(300-700)$K\nfor rapidly spinning neutron stars, respectively. Although for the latter the\nDyson construction is unrealistically massive and cannot be considered\nseriously. Analyzing the stresses in terms of the radiation and wind flows it\nhas been argued that they cannot significantly affect the ring construction. On\nthe other hand, the ring in-plane unstable equilibrium can be restored by the\nenergy which is small compared to the energy extracted from the star. This\nindicates that the search for infrared ring-like sources close to slowly\nrotating pulsars seems to be quite promising.\n", "  We investigate magnetic, thermal, and dielectric properties of SrCuTe2O6,\nwhich is isostructural to PbCuTe2O6, a recently found, Cu-based 3D frustrated\nmagnet with a corner sharing triangular spin network having dominant first and\nsecond nearest neighbor (nn) couplings [B. Koteswararao, et al. Phys. Rev. B\n90, 035141 (2014)]. Although SrCuTe2O6 has a structurally similar spin network,\nbut the magnetic data exhibit the characteristic features of a typical quasi\n-one-dimensional magnet, which mainly resulted from the magnetically dominant\nthird nn coupling, uniform chains. The magnetic properties of this system are\nstudied via magnetization (M), heat capacity (Cp), dielectric constant,\nmeasurements along with ab-initio band structure calculations. Magnetic\nsusceptibility chi(T) data show a broad maximum at 32 K and the system orders\nat low temperatures TN1=5.5 K and TN2=4.5 K, respectively. The analysis of\nchi(T) data gives an intra-chain coupling, J3/kB, to be about - 42 K with\nnon-negligible frustrated inter-chain couplings (J1/kB and J2/kB). The hopping\nparameters obtained from LDA band structure calculations also suggest the\npresence of coupled uniform chains. The observation of simultaneous anomalies\nin dielectric constant at TN1 and TN2 suggests the presence of\nmagneto-dielectric effect in SrCuTe2O6. A magnetic phase diagram is also built\nbased on M, C p, and dielectric constant results.\n", "  We report a study of the Ca$_{0.73}$La$_{0.27}$FeAs$_2$ single crystals. We\nunravel a monoclinic to triclinic phase transition at 58 K, and a paramagnetic\nto stripe antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase transition at 54 K, below which spins\norder 45$^\\circ$ away from the stripe direction. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthis material is substantially structurally untwinned at ambient pressure with\nthe formation of spin rotation walls (S-walls). Finally, in addition to the\ncentral-hole and corner-electron Fermi pockets usually appearing in Fe pnictide\nsuperconductors, angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) measurements resolve a\nFermiology where an extra electron pocket of mainly As chain character exists\nat the Brillouin zone edge.\n", "  We study how X-rays from stellar binary systems and the hot intracluster\nmedium (ICM) affect the radiative cooling rates of gas in galaxies. Our study\nuses a novel implementation of gas cooling in the moving-mesh hydrodynamics\ncode \\textsc{arepo}. X-rays from stellar binaries do not affect cooling at all\nas their emission spectrum is too hard to effectively couple with galactic gas.\nIn contrast, X-rays from the ICM couple well with gas in the temperature range\n$10^4 - 10^6$ K. Idealised simulations show that the hot halo radiation field\nhas minimal impact on the dynamics of cooling flows in clusters because of the\nhigh virial temperature ($> 10^7$K), making the interaction between the gas and\nincident photons very ineffective. Satellite galaxies in cluster environments,\non the other hand, experience a high radiation flux due to the emission from\nthe host halo. Low mass satellites ($< 10^{12}\\rm{M_\\odot}$) in particular have\nvirial temperatures that are exactly in the regime where the effect of the\nradiation field is maximal. Idealised simulations of satellite galaxies\nincluding only the effect of host halo radiation (no ram pressure stripping or\ntidal effects) fields show a drastic reduction in the amount of cool gas formed\n($\\sim 40\\%$) on a short timescale of about $0.5$ Gyrs. A galaxy merger\nsimulation including all the other environmental quenching mechanisms, shows\nabout $20\\%$ reduction in the stellar mass of the satellite and about $\\sim\n30\\%$ reduction in star formation rate after $1$ Gyr due to the host hot halo\nradiation field. These results indicate that the hot halo radiation fields\npotentially play an important role in quenching galaxies in cluster\nenvironments.\n", "  We explore the degeneracy and discreteness problems in the standard\ncosmological model (\\Lambda CDM). We use the Observational Hubble Data (OHD)\nand the type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) data to study this issue. In order to\ndescribe the discreteness in fitting of data, we define a factor G to test the\ninfluence from each single data point and analyze the goodness of G. Our\nresults indicate that a higher absolute value of G shows a better capability of\ndistinguishing models, which means the parameters are restricted into smaller\nconfidence intervals with a larger figure of merit evaluation. Consequently, we\nclaim that the factor G is an effective way in model differentiation when using\ndifferent models to fit the observational data.\n", "  We report the cooling of electrons in nanoelectronic Coulomb blockade\nthermometers below 4 mK. Above 7 mK the devices are in good thermal contact\nwith the environment, well isolated from electrical noise, and not susceptible\nto self-heating. This is attributed to an optimised design that incorporates\ncooling fins with a high electron-phonon coupling and on-chip electronic\nfilters, combined with a low-noise electronic measurement setup. Below 7 mK the\nelectron temperature is seen to diverge from the ambient temperature. By\nimmersing a Coulomb Blockade Thermometer in the 3He/4He refrigerant of a\ndilution refrigerator, we measure a lowest electron temperature of 3.7 mK.\n", "  The effect of tube diameter $D$ and capillary number $Ca$ on platelet\nmargination in blood flow at $\\approx 37\\%$ tube haematocrit is investigated.\nThe system is modelled as three-dimensional suspension of deformable red blood\ncells and nearly rigid platelets using a combination of the lattice-Boltzmann,\nimmersed boundary and finite element methods. Results show that margination is\nfacilitated by a non-diffusive radial platelet transport. This effect is\nimportant near the edge of the cell-free layer, but it is only observed for $Ca\n> 0.2$, when red blood cells are tank-treading rather than tumbling. It is also\nshown that platelet trapping in the cell-free layer is reversible for $Ca \\leq\n0.2$. Only for the smallest investigated tube ($D = 10 \\mu\\text{m}$)\nmargination is essentially independent of $Ca$. Once platelets have reached the\ncell-free layer, they tend to slide rather than tumble. The tumbling rate is\nessentially independent of $Ca$ but increases with $D$. Tumbling is suppressed\nby the strong confinement due to the relatively small cell-free layer thickness\nat $\\approx 37\\%$ tube haematocrit.\n", "  We demonstrate the possibility to efficiently split the near-field heat flux\nexchanged between graphene nano-disks by tuning their doping. This result paves\nthe way for the developement of an active control of propagation directions for\nheat fluxes exchanged in near-field throughout integrated nanostructures\nnetworks.\n", "  Quantum theory was discovered in an adventurous way, under the urge to solve\npuzzles-like the spectrum of the blackbody radiation-that haunted the physics\ncommunity at the beginning of the 20th century. It soon became clear, though,\nthat quantum theory was not just a theory of specific physical systems, but\nrather a new language of universal applicability. Can this language be\nreconstructed from first principles? Can we arrive at it from logical\nreasoning, instead of ad hoc guesswork? A positive answer was provided in Refs.\n[1, 2], where we put forward six principles that identify quantum theory\nuniquely in a broad class of theories. We first defined a class of \"theories of\ninformation\", constructed as extensions of probability theory in which events\ncan be connected into networks. In this framework, we formulated the six\nprinciples as rules governing the control and the accessibility of information.\nDirectly from these rules, we reconstructed a number of quantum information\nfeatures, and eventually, the whole Hilbert space framework. In short, our\nprinciples characterize quantum theory as the theory of information that allows\nfor maximal control of randomness.\n", "  We consider a lifting of Joseph ideals for the minimal nilpotent orbit\nclosure to the setting of affine Kac-Moody algebras and find new examples of\naffine vertex algebras whose associated varieties are minimal nilpotent orbit\nclosures. As an application we obtain a new family of lisse ($C_2$-cofinite)\nW-algebras that are not coming from admissible representations of affine\nKac-Moody algebras.\n", "  Charged current inclusive neutrino-nucleus cross sections are evaluated using\nthe superscaling model for quasielastic scattering and its extension to the\npion production region. The contribution of two-particle-two-hole vector\nmeson-exchange current excitations is also considered within a fully\nrelativistic model tested against electron scattering data. The results are\ncompared with the inclusive neutrino-nucleus data from the T2K and SciBooNE\nexperiments. For experiments where $\\langle E_\\nu \\rangle \\sim 0.8$ GeV, the\nthree mechanisms considered in this work provide good agreement with the data.\nHowever, when the neutrino energy is larger, effects from beyond the $\\Delta$\nalso appear to be playing a role. The results show that processes induced by\ntwo-body currents play a minor role at the kinematics considered.\n", "  Results of a search for new phenomena in events with large missing transverse\nmomentum and a Higgs boson decaying to two photons are reported. Data from\nproton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV and corresponding\nto an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ have been collected with the\nATLAS detector at the LHC. The observed data are well described by the expected\nStandard Model backgrounds. Upper limits on the cross section of events with\nlarge missing transverse momentum and a Higgs boson candidate are also placed.\nExclusion limits are presented for models of physics beyond the Standard Model\nfeaturing dark-matter candidates.\n", "  We study positive kernels on $X\\times X$, where $X$ is a set equipped with an\naction of a group, and taking values in the set of $\\mathcal A$-sesquilinear\nforms on a (not necessarily Hilbert) module over a $C^*$-algebra $\\mathcal A$.\nThese maps are assumed to be covariant with respect to the group action on $X$\nand a representation of the group in the set of invertible ($\\mathcal\nA$-linear) module maps. We find necessary and sufficient conditions for\nextremality of such kernels in certain convex subsets of positive covariant\nkernels. Our focus is mainly on a particular example of these kernels: a\ncompletely positive (CP) covariant map for which we obtain a covariant minimal\ndilation (or KSGNS construction). We determine the extreme points of the set of\nnormalized covariant CP maps and, as a special case, study covariant quantum\nobservables and instruments whose value space is a transitive space of a\nunimodular type-I group. As an example, we discuss the case of instruments that\nare covariant with respect to a square-integrable representation.\n", "  We model particle growth in a turbulent, viscously evolving protoplanetary\nnebula, incorporating sticking, bouncing, fragmentation, and mass transfer at\nhigh speeds. We treat small particles using a moments method and large\nparticles using a traditional histogram binning, including a probability\ndistribution function of collisional velocities. The fragmentation strength of\nthe particles depends on their composition (icy aggregates are stronger than\nsilicate aggregates). The particle opacity, which controls the nebula thermal\nstructure, evolves as particles grow and mass redistributes. While growing,\nparticles drift radially due to nebula headwind drag. Particles of different\ncompositions evaporate at \"evaporation fronts\" (EFs) where the midplane\ntemperature exceeds their respective evaporation temperatures. We track the\nvapor and solid phases of each component, accounting for advection and radial\nand vertical diffusion. We present characteristic results in evolutions lasting\n$2 \\times 10^5$ years. In general, (a) mass is transferred from the outer to\ninner nebula in significant amounts, creating radial concentrations of solids\nat EFs, (b) particle sizes are limited by a combination of fragmentation,\nbouncing, and drift, (c) \"lucky\" large particles never represent a significant\namount of mass, and (d) restricted radial zones just outside each EF become\ncompositionally enriched in the associated volatiles. We point out implications\nfor mm-submm SEDs and inference of nebula mass, radial banding, the role of\nopacity on new mechanisms for generating turbulence, enrichment of meteorites\nin heavy oxygen isotopes, variable and nonsolar redox conditions, primary\naccretion of silicate and icy planetesimals, and the makeup of Jupiter's core.\n", "  The discussions of Hawking radiation via tunneling method have been performed\nextensively in the case of scalar particles. Moreover, there are also several\nworks in discussing the tunneling method for Hawking radiation by using higher\nspins, e.g. neutrino, photon, and gravitino, in the background of static black\nholes. Interestingly, it is found that the Hawking temperature for static black\nholes using the higher spins particles has no difference compared to the one\ncomputed using scalars. In this paper, we study the Hawking radiation for a\nspherically symmetric and time dependent black holes using the tunneling of\nDirac particles, photon, and gravitino. We find that the obtained Hawking\ntemperature is similar to the one derived in the tunneling method by using\nscalars.\n", "  The energy density of the holographic dark energy is based on the area law of\nentropy, and thus any modification of the area law leads to a modified\nholographic energy density. Inspired by the entropy expression associated with\nthe apparent horizon of a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe in DGP\nbraneworld, we propose a new model for the holographic dark energy in the\nframework of DGP brane cosmology. We investigate the cosmological consequences\nof this new model and calculate the equation of state parameter by choosing the\nHubble radius, $L = H^{-1}$, as the system's IR cutoff. Our study show that,\ndue to the effects of the extra dimension (bulk), the identification of\nIR-cutoff with Hubble radius, can reproduce the present acceleration of the\nUniverse expansion. This is in contrast to the ordinary holographic dark energy\nin standard cosmology which leads to the zero equation of state parameter in\nthe case of choosing the Hubble radius as system's IR cutoff in the absence of\ninteraction between dark matter and dark energy.\n", "  This book is divided into two parts. In the first part we give an elementary\nintroduction to computational physics consisting of 21 simulations which\noriginated from a formal course of lectures and laboratory simulations\ndelivered since 2010 to physics students at Annaba University. The second part\nis much more advanced and deals with the problem of how to set up working Monte\nCarlo simulations of matrix field theories which involve finite dimensional\nmatrix regularizations of noncommutative and fuzzy field theories, fuzzy spaces\nand matrix geometry. The study of matrix field theory in its own right has also\nbecome very important to the proper understanding of all noncommutative, fuzzy\nand matrix phenomena. The second part, which consists of 9 simulations, was\ndelivered informally to doctoral students who are working on various problems\nin matrix field theory. Sample codes as well as sample key solutions are also\nprovided for convenience and completness. An appendix containing an executive\narabic summary of the first part is added at the end of the book.\n", "  Pulsar glitches, i.e. the sudden spin-ups of pulsars, have been detected for\nmost pulsars that we known. The mechanism giving rise to this kind of\nphenomenon is uncertain, although a large data set has been built. In the\nframework of star-quake model, based on~\\cite{Baym1971}, the glitch-sizes (the\nrelative increases of spin-frequencies during glitches) $\\Delta \\Omega/\\Omega$\ndepend on the released energies during glitches, with less released energies\ncorresponding to smaller glitch sizes. On the other hand, as one of dark matter\ncandidates, our Galaxy might be filled with the so called strange nuggets (SNs)\nwhich are the relics from the early Universe. In this case the collisions\nbetween pulsars and SNs is inevitable, and these collisions would lead to\nglitches when enough elastic energy has been accumulated during the spin-down\nprocess. The SNs-triggered glitches could release less energy, because the\naccumulated elastic energy would be less than that in the scenario of glitches\nwithout SNs. Therefore, if a pulsar is hit frequently by SNs, it would tend to\nhave more small size glitches, whose values of $\\Delta \\Omega/\\Omega$ are\nsmaller than that in standard star-quake model (with larger amounts of released\nenergy). Based on the assumption that in our Galaxy the distribution of SNs is\nsimilar to that of dark matter, as well as on the glitch data in ATNF Pulsar\nCatalogue and Jodrell Bank glitch table, we find that in our Galaxy the\nincidences of small size glitches exhibit tendencies consistent with the\ncollision rates of pulsars and strange nuggets. Further test of this scenario\nis expected by detecting more small glitches (e.g., by the Square Kilometre\nArray).\n", "  Previous derivations of the BTZ black hole entropy from a dual conformal\ndescription place the degrees of freedom at spatial infinity. Here it is shown\nfor the non-rotating case that a dual conformal description exists at any\nlocation around the black hole, a result that has a strong physical appeal\nconsidering that in 2+1 dimensions there are no propagating degrees of freedom\nin the classical theory. Two copies of the central charge of $3\\ell/2G$ are\nrecovered, and the microcanonical Cardy formula yields the correct\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy.\n", "  Using a simple analytic formalism, we demonstrate that significant dark\nmatter self-interactions produce halo cores that obey scaling relations nearly\nindependent of the underlying particle physics parameters such as the\nannihilation cross section and the mass of the dark matter particle. For dwarf\ngalaxies, we predict that the core density $\\rho_c$ and the core radius $r_c$\nshould obey $\\rho_c r_c \\approx 41 \\,\\text{M}_\\odot \\text{pc}^{-2}$ with a weak\nmass dependence $\\sim M^{0.2}$. Remarkably, such a scaling relation has\nrecently been empirically inferred. Scaling relations involving core mass, core\nradius, and core velocity dispersion are predicted and agree well with\nobservational data. By calibrating against numerical simulations, we predict\nthe scatter in these relations and find them to be in excellent agreement with\nexisting data. Future observations can test our predictions for different halo\nmasses and redshifts.\n", "  Cavity-based large scale quantum information processing (QIP) may involve\nmultiple cavities and require performing various quantum logic operations on\nqubits distributed in different cavities. Geometric-phase-based quantum\ncomputing has drawn much attention recently, which offers advantages against\ninaccuracies and local fluctuations. In addition, multiqubit gates are\nparticularly appealing and play important roles in QIP. We here present a\nsimple and efficient scheme for realizing a multi-target-qubit unconventional\ngeometric phase gate in a multi-cavity system. This multiqubit phase gate has a\ncommon control qubit but different target qubits distributed in different\ncavities, which can be achieved using a single-step operation. The gate\noperation time is independent of the number of qubits and only two levels for\neach qubit are needed. This multiqubit gate is generic, e.g., by performing\nsingle-qubit operations, it can be converted into two types of significant\nmulti-target-qubit phase gates useful in QIP and quantum Fourier transform. The\nproposal is quite general, which can be used to accomplish the same task for a\ngeneral type of qubits such as atoms, NV centers, quantum dots, and qubits.\n", "  We consider flows, called $W^{\\rm u}$ flows, whose orbits are the unstable\nmanifolds of a codimension one Anosov flow. Under some regularity assumptions,\nwe give a short proof of the strong mixing property of $W^{\\rm u}$ flows and we\nshow that $W^{\\rm u}$ flows have purely absolutely continuous spectrum in the\northocomplement of the constant functions. As an application, we obtain that\ntime changes of the classical horocycle flows for compact surfaces of constant\nnegative curvature have purely absolutely continuous spectrum in the\northocomplement of the constant functions for time changes in a regularity\nclass slightly less than $C^2$. This generalises recent results on time changes\nof horocycle flows.\n", "  We present exact spherical black hole solutions in de Rham, Gabadadze and\nTolley (dRGT) massive gravity for a generic choice of the parameters in the\ntheory, and also discuss the thermodynamical and phase structure of the black\nhole in both the grand canonical and canonical ensembles (for charged case). It\nturns out that the dGRT black hole solutions includes the known solutions to\nthe Einstein field equations, such as, the monopole-de Sitter-Schwarzschild\nones with the coefficients for the third and fourth terms in the potential and\nthe graviton mass in massive gravity naturally generates the cosmological\nconstant and the global monopole term. Furthermore, we compute the mass,\ntemperature, and entropy of dGRT black hole solutions and also perform\nthermodynamical stability. It turns out that the presence of the graviton mass\ncompletely changes the black hole thermodynamics, and it can provide the\nHawking-Page phase transition which is also true for the obtained charged black\nholes. Interestingly, the entropy of a black hole is unaffected and still obeys\narea law. In particular, our results, in the limit $m_g \\rightarrow 0$, reduced\nexactly to \\emph{vis-$\\grave{a}$-vis} the general relativity results.\n", "  We investigate the ISM properties of 13 star-forming galaxies within the z~2\nCOSMOS cluster. We show that the cluster members have [NII]/Ha and [OIII]/Hb\nemission-line ratios similar to z~2 field galaxies, yet systematically\ndifferent emission-line ratios (by ~0.17 dex) from the majority of local\nstar-forming galaxies. We find no statistically significant difference in the\n[NII]/Ha and [OIII]/Hb line ratios or ISM pressures among the z~2 cluster\ngalaxies and field galaxies at the same redshift. We show that our cluster\ngalaxies have significantly larger ionization parameters (by up to an order of\nmagnitude) than local star-forming galaxies. We hypothesize that these high\nionization parameters may be associated with large specific star formation\nrates (i.e. a large star formation rate per unit stellar mass). If this\nhypothesis is correct, then this relationship would have important implications\nfor the geometry and/or the mass of stars contained within individual star\nclusters as a function of redshift.\n", "  We perform a Bayesian analysis in the basis of a recently developed\ntwo-parameter class of hybrid equations of state that allow for high-mass\ncompact star twins. While recently a wide range of radii, from 9 - 15 km, has\nbeen inferred for different neutron stars using different techniques, we\nperform our analysis under the supposition that the radii are towards the large\nend ($13-15$ km). We use this radius constraint together with the undebated\nstatistically independent constraint for high masses ($\\sim 2~M_\\odot$) as\npriors in selecting the most probable hybrid equations of state from a family\nwith two free parameters: the baryon excluded volume in the hadronic phase and\nthe 8-quark vector channel interaction in the quark matter phase.\n", "  Within the framework of the modified potential cluster model with the state\nclassification of nuclear particles according to Young tableaux the possibility\nof describing the available experimental data for the total cross sections of\nthe neutron radiative capture on 8Li at thermal and astrophysical energies was\nconsidered.\n", "  The Ising model on annealed complex networks with degree distribution\ndecaying algebraically as $p(K)\\sim K^{-\\lambda}$ has a second-order phase\ntransition at finite temperature if $\\lambda> 3$. In the absence of space\ndimensionality, $\\lambda$ controls the transition strength; mean-field theory\napplies for $\\lambda >5$ but critical exponents are $\\lambda$-dependent if\n$\\lambda < 5$. Here we show that, as for regular lattices, the celebrated\nLee-Yang circle theorem is obeyed for the former case. However, unlike on\nregular lattices where it is independent of dimensionality, the circle theorem\nfails on complex networks when $\\lambda < 5$. We discuss the importance of this\nresult for both theory and experiments on phase transitions and critical\nphenomena. We also investigate the finite-size scaling of Lee-Yang zeros in\nboth regimes as well as the multiplicative logarithmic corrections which occur\nat $\\lambda=5$.\n", "  We analyze the competition of magnetism and superconductivity in the\ntwo-dimensional Hubbard model with a moderate interaction strength, including\nthe possibility of incommensurate spiral magnetic order. Using an unbiased\nrenormalization group approach, we compute magnetic and superconducting order\nparameters in the ground state. In addition to previously established regions\nof Neel order coexisting with d-wave superconductivity, the calculations reveal\nfurther coexistence regions where superconductivity is accompanied by\nincommensurate magnetic order.\n", "  We present a direct experimental investigation of the thermal ordering in an\nartificial analogue of an asymmetric two dimensional Ising system composed of a\nrectangular array of nano-fabricated magnetostatically interacting islands.\nDuring fabrication and below a critical thickness of the magnetic material the\nislands are thermally fluctuating and thus the system is able to explore its\nphase space. Above the critical thickness the islands freeze-in resulting in an\narrested thermalized state for the array. Determining the magnetic state of the\narray we demonstrate a genuine artificial two-dimensional Ising system which\ncan be analyzed in the context of nearest neighbour interactions.\n", "  We use the shear catalog from the CFHT Stripe-82 Survey to measure the\nsubhalo masses of satellite galaxies in redMaPPer clusters. Assuming a Chabrier\nInitial Mass Function (IMF) and a truncated NFW model for the subhalo mass\ndistribution, we find that the sub-halo mass to galaxy stellar mass ratio\nincreases as a function of projected halo-centric radius $r_p$, from $M_{\\rm\nsub}/M_{\\rm star}=4.43^{+ 6.63}_{- 2.23}$ at $r_p \\in [0.1,0.3]$ $h^{-1}Mpc$ to\n$M_{\\rm sub}/M_{\\rm star}=75.40^{+ 19.73}_{- 19.09}$ at $r_p \\in [0.6,0.9]$\n$h^{-1}Mpc$. We also investigate the dependence of subhalo masses on stellar\nmass by splitting satellite galaxies into two stellar mass bins:\n$10<\\log(M_{\\rm star}/M_{\\rm sun})<10.5$ and $11<\\log(M_{\\rm star}/M_{\\rm\nsun})<12$. The best-fit subhalo mass of the more massive satellite galaxy bin\nis larger than that of the less massive satellites: $\\log(M_{\\rm sub}/M_{\\rm\nsun})=11.14 ^{+ 0.66 }_{- 0.73}$ ($M_{\\rm sub}/M_{\\rm\nstar}=19.5^{+19.8}_{-17.9}$) versus $\\log(M_{\\rm sub}/M_{\\rm sun})=12.38 ^{+\n0.16 }_{- 0.16}$ ($M_{\\rm sub}/M_{\\rm star}=21.1^{+7.4}_{-7.7}$).\n", "  We study the mapping from Lagrangian to Eulerian space in the context of the\nEffective Field Theory (EFT) of Large Scale Structure. We compute Lagrangian\ndisplacements with Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT) and perform the full\nnon-perturbative transformation from displacement to density. When expanded up\nto a given order, this transformation reproduces the standard Eulerian\nPerturbation Theory (SPT) at the same order. However, the full transformation\nfrom displacement to density also includes higher order terms. These terms\nexplicitly resum long wavelength motions, thus making the resulting density\nfield better correlated with the true non-linear density field. As a result,\nthe regime of validity of this approach is expected to extend that of the\nEulerian EFT, and match that of the IR-resummed Eulerian EFT. This approach\nthus effectively enables a test of the IR-resummed EFT at the field level. We\nestimate the size of stochastic, non-perturbative contributions to the matter\ndensity power spectrum. We find that in our highest order calculation, at\nredshift z=0 the power spectrum of the density field is reproduced with an\naccuracy of 1 % (10 %) up to k=0.25 h/Mpc (k=0.46 h/Mpc). We believe that the\ndominant source of the remaining error is the stochastic contribution.\nUnfortunately, on these scales the stochastic term does not yet scale as $k^4$\nas it does in the very low-k regime. Thus, modeling this contribution might be\nchallenging.\n", "  We report the detection of CO(1-0) emission from NGC 1277, a lenticular\ngalaxy in the Perseus Cluster. NGC 1277 has previously been proposed to host an\novermassive black hole (BH) compared to the galaxy bulge luminosity (mass),\nbased on stellar-kinematic measurements. The CO(1-0) emission, observed with\nthe IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) using both, a more compact\n(2.9-arcsec resolution) and a more extended (1-arcsec resolution)\nconfiguration, is likely to originate from the dust lane encompassing the\ngalaxy nucleus at a distance of 0.9 arcsec (~320 pc). The double-horned CO(1-0)\nprofile found at 2.9-arcsec resolution traces $1.5\\times 10^8\\ M_\\odot$ of\nmolecular gas, likely orbiting in the dust lane at $\\sim 550\\ \\mathrm{km\\\ns^{-1}}$, which suggests a total enclosed mass of $\\sim 2\\times 10^{10}\\\nM_\\odot$. At 1-arcsec resolution, the CO(1-0) emission appears spatially\nresolved along the dust lane in east-west direction, though at a low\nsignal-to-noise ratio. In agreement with the previous stellar-kinematic\nmeasurements, the CO(1-0) kinematics is found to be consistent with an $\\sim\n1.7\\times 10^{10}\\ M_\\odot$ BH for a stellar mass-to-light ratio of\n$M/L_V=6.3$, while a less massive BH of $\\sim 5\\times 10^{9}\\ M_\\odot$ is\npossible when assuming a larger $M/L_V=10$. While the molecular gas reservoir\nmay be associated with a low level of star formation activity, the extended\n2.6-mm continuum emission is likely to originate from a weak AGN, possibly\ncharacterized by an inverted radio-to-millimetre spectral energy distribution.\nLiterature radio and X-ray data indicate that the BH in NGC 1277 is also\novermassive with respect to the Fundamental Plane of BH activity.\n", "  The elementary optical excitations of a two-dimensional electron system\nstrongly coupled to a microcavity are trion-polaritons. Using a variational\napproach, we demonstrate that the competition between Coulomb interaction and\nlight-matter coupling plays a crucial role in determining the lowest-energy\norbital and spin properties of trion-polaritons. When the light-matter\ninteraction exceeds the bare trion binding, singlet and triplet trion states\nare mixed due to a cavity-mediated spin-orbit effect, which in turn results in\na strong increase of the outer electron Bohr radius. In this strong cavity\ncoupling regime, the trion-polariton consists of an exciton-polariton\nsurrounded by a weakly bound electron and is reminiscent of a coherent Rydberg\nexcitation.\n", "  Baldwin (1982) wrote that \\emph{the distribution of sources in the radio\nluminosity, $P$, overall physical size, $D$, diagram} could be considered as\n\\emph{the radio astronomer's $H-R$ diagram}. However, unlike the case of stars,\nnot only the intrinsic properties of the jets, but also those of the host\ngalaxy and the intergalactic medium are relevant to explain the evolutionary\ntracks of radio radio sources. In this contribution I review the current status\nof our understanding of the evolution of radio sources from a theoretical and\nnumerical perspective, using the $P-D$ diagram as a framework. An excess of\ncompact (linear size $\\leq 10$~kpc) sources could be explained by low-power\njets being decelerated within the host galaxy, as shown by recent numerical\nsimulations. Finally, I discuss the possible tracks that radio sources may\nfollow within this diagram, and the physical processes that can explain the\ndifferent tracks.\n", "  The American Physical Society recently released a statement calling on all\nuniversity physics departments to provide or facilitate access to research\nexperiences for all undergraduate students. In response, we investigated the\ncurrent status of access to undergraduate research at University of Colorado\nBoulder (CU), a large research institution where the number of undergraduate\nphysics majors outnumber faculty by roughly ten to one. We created and\nadministered two surveys within CU's Physics Department: one probed\nundergraduate students' familiarity with, and participation in, research; the\nother probed faculty members' experiences as research mentors to\nundergraduates. We describe the development of these instruments, our results,\nand our corresponding evidence-based recommendations for improving local access\nto undergraduate research experiences. Reflecting on our work, we make several\nconnections to an institutional change framework and note how other\nuniversities and colleges might adapt our process.\n", "  Troubleshooting systems is integral to experimental physics in both research\nand instructional laboratory settings. The recently adopted AAPT Lab Guidelines\nidentify troubleshooting as an important learning outcome of the undergraduate\nlaboratory curriculum. We investigate students' model-based reasoning on a\ntroubleshooting task using data collected in think-aloud interviews during\nwhich pairs of students attempted to diagnose and repair a malfunctioning\ncircuit. Our analysis scheme is informed by the Experimental Modeling\nFramework, which describes physicists' use of mathematical and conceptual\nmodels when reasoning about experimental systems. We show that this framework\nis a useful lens through which to characterize the troubleshooting process.\n", "  Students in physics laboratory courses, particularly at the upper division,\nare often expected to engage in troubleshooting. Although there are numerous\nways in which students may proceed when diagnosing a problem, not all\napproaches are equivalent in terms of providing meaningful insight. It is\nreasonable to believe that metacognition, by assisting students in making\ninformed decisions, is an integral component of effective troubleshooting. We\nreport on an investigation of authentic student troubleshooting in the context\nof junior-level electronics courses at two institutions. Think-aloud interviews\nwere conducted with pairs of students as they attempted to repair a\nmalfunctioning operational-amplifier circuit. Video data from the interviews\nhave been analyzed to examine the relationship between each group's\ntroubleshooting activities and instances of socially mediated metacognition. We\npresent an analysis of a short episode from one interview.\n", "  The paradigm for GRB prompt emission is changing. Since early in the CGRO\nera, the empirical Band function has been considered a good description of the\nkeV-MeV spectra although its shape is very often inconsistent with the\npredictions of the pure synchrotron emission scenarios. We have recently\nestablished a new observational model analyzing data of the NASA Fermi\nGamma-ray Space Telescope. In this model, GRB prompt emission is a combination\nof three main emission components: (i) a thermal-like component that we\ninterpreted so far as the jet photosphere emission, (ii) a non-thermal\ncomponent that we interpreted so far as synchrotron radiation, and (iii) an\nadditional non-thermal (cutoff) power-law most likely of inverse Compton\norigin. In this article we reanalyze some of the bright GRBs observed with\nCGRO/BATSE with the new model, namely GRBs 941017, 970111 and 990123. We\nconclude that BATSE data are fully consistent with the recent results obtained\nwith Fermi: some bright BATSE GRBs exhibit three separate components during the\nprompt phase with similar spectral parameters as these reported from Fermi\ndata. In addition, the analysis of the BATSE GRBs with the new model results in\na relation between the time-resolved energy flux of the non-thermal component\nand its corresponding $\\nu$F$_\\nu$ peak energy (i.e.,\nF$_{i}^{nTh}$-E$_{peak,i}^{nTh}$) that has a similar index as the one initially\nderived from Fermi data. For GRBs with known redshift (z) this results in a\npossible universal relation between the luminosity of the non-thermal component\nand its corresponding $\\nu$F$_\\nu$ peak energy in the rest frame (i.e.,\nL$_{i}^{nTh}$-E$_{peak,i}^{NT,rest}$). We estimated z for GRBs 941017 and\n970111 using GRB 990123--with z=1.61--as a reference. The estimated z for GRB\n941017 is typical for long GRBs and the estimated z for GRB 970111 is right in\nthe range of the expected values for this burst.\n", "  The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) has collected spectra for\nover one million galaxies at $0.15<z<0.7$ over a volume of 15.3 Gpc$^3$ (9,376\ndeg$^2$) -- providing us an opportunity to study the most massive galaxy\npopulations with vanishing sample variance. However, BOSS samples are selected\nvia complex color cuts that are optimized for cosmology studies, not galaxy\nscience. In this paper, we supplement BOSS samples with photometric redshifts\nfrom the Stripe 82 Massive Galaxy Catalog and measure the total galaxy stellar\nmass function (SMF) at $z\\sim0.3$ and $z\\sim0.55$. With the total SMF in hand,\nwe characterize the stellar mass completeness of BOSS samples. The\nhigh-redshift CMASS (\"constant mass\") sample is significantly impacted by mass\nincompleteness and is 80% complete at $\\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\\odot}) >11.6$ only in\nthe narrow redshift range $z=[0.51,0.61]$. The low redshift LOWZ sample is 80%\ncomplete at $\\log_{10}(M_*/M_{\\odot}) >11.6$ for $z=[0.15,0.43]$. To construct\nmass complete samples at lower masses, spectroscopic samples need to be\nsignificantly supplemented by photometric redshifts. This work will enable\nfuture studies to better utilize the BOSS samples for galaxy-formation science.\n", "  The publicly available spectrum generators for the NMSSM often lead to\ndifferent predictions for the mass of the standard model-like Higgs boson even\nif using the same renormalization scheme and two-loop accuracy. Depending on\nthe parameter point, the differences can exceed 5 GeV, and even reach 8 GeV for\nmoderate superparticle masses of up to 2 TeV. It is shown here that these\ndifferences can be traced back to the calculation of the running standard model\nparameters entering all calculations, to the approximations used in the\ntwo-loop corrections included in the different codes, and to different choices\nfor the renormalization conditions and scales. In particular, the importance of\nthe calculation of the top Yukawa coupling is pointed out.\n", "  We review the current state of understanding how accretion onto a black hole\nproceeds and what are they key elements needed to form relativistic jets. Since\nthe theoretical progress is severely halted by the lack of deep understanding\nof the microphysics involved, particularly in the presence of strong magnetic\nfields, all proposed solutions have a status of models, and their selection has\nto be based directly on observational constraints.\n", "  We propose a model that describes phase transition including meta\\-stable\nstates present in the van der Waals Equation of State. From a convex\noptimization problem on the Helmoltz free energy of a mixture, we deduce a\ndynamical system that is able to depict the mass transfer between two phases,\nfor which equilibrium states are either metastable states, stable states or {a\ncoexistent state}. The dynamical system is then used as a relaxation source\nterm in an isothermal 4$\\times$4 two-phase model. We use a Finite Volume scheme\nthat treats the convective part and the source term in a fractional step way.\nNumerical results illustrate the ability of the model to capture phase\ntransition and metastable states.\n", "  This is an extension of our previous work on $J/\\Psi$, $\\Psi'(2S)$,\n$\\Upsilon(nS)$ production in p-p and A-A collisions to the production of\n$D^+(c\\bar{d}),D^o(c\\bar{u})$, with the main new aspect being the fragmentation\nprobability, $D_{c \\rightarrow c\\bar{q}}$, which has been calculated almost two\ndecades ago. The rapidity cross sections for $D^+(c\\bar{d}),D^o(c\\bar{u})$\nproduction from both p-p and d-AU collisions is estimated.\n", "  Nanofibers functionalized by metal nanostructures and particles are exploited\nas effective flexible substrates for SERS analysis. Their complex\nthree-dimensional structure may provide Raman signals enhanced by orders of\nmagnitude compared to untextured surfaces. Understanding the origin of such\nimproved performances is therefore very important for pushing nanofiber-based\nanalytical technologies to their upper limit. Here we report on polymer\nnanofiber mats which can be exploited as substrates for enhancing the Raman\nspectra of adsorbed probe molecules. The increased surface area and the\nscattering of light in the nanofibrous system are individually analyzed as\nmechanisms to enhance Raman scattering. The deposition of gold nanorods on the\nfibers further amplifies Raman signals due to SERS. This study suggests that\nRaman signals can be finely tuned in intensity and effectively enhanced in\nnanofiber mats and arrays by properly tailoring the architecture, composition,\nand light-scattering properties of the complex networks of filaments.\n", "  The spectroscopy of the apparent horizon of Vaidya black holes is\ninvestigated via adiabatic invariance. We obtain an equally spaced entropy\nspectrum with its quantum equal to the one given by Bekenstein. We demonstrate\nthat the quantization of entropy and area is a generic property of horizon, not\nonly for stationary black holes, and the results also exit in a dynamical black\nhole. Our work also shows that the quantization of black hole is closely\nrelated to Hawking temperature, which is an interesting thing.\n", "  We present Star Formation Histories (SFHs) for a sample of 104 massive\n(stellar mass M > 10$^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$) quiescent galaxies (MQGs) at\n$z$=1.0-1.5 from the analysis of spectro-photometric data from the SHARDS and\nHST/WFC3 G102 and G141 surveys of the GOODS-N field, jointly with broad-band\nobservations from ultraviolet (UV) to far-infrared (Far-IR). The sample is\nconstructed on the basis of rest-frame UVJ colours and specific star formation\nrates (sSFR=SFR/Mass). The Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) of each galaxy\nare compared to models assuming a delayed exponentially declining SFH. A Monte\nCarlo algorithm characterizes the degeneracies, which we are able to break\ntaking advantage of the SHARDS data resolution, by measuring indices such as\nMgUV and D4000. The population of MQGs shows a duality in their properties. The\nsample is dominated (85%) by galaxies with young mass-weighted ages, tM $<$ 2\nGyr, short star formation timescales, $\\langle \\tau \\rangle$ $\\sim$ 60-200 Myr,\nand masses log(M/M$_{\\odot}$) $\\sim$ 10.5. There is an older population (15%)\nwith tM$=$2 - 4 Gyr, longer star formation timescales, $\\langle \\tau\n\\rangle$$\\sim$ 400 Myr, and larger masses, log(M/M$_{\\odot}$) $\\sim$ 10.7. The\nSFHs of our MQGs are consistent with the slope and the location of the Main\nSequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies at $z$ $>$ 1.0, when our galaxies were\n0.5-1.0 Gyr old. According to these SFHs, all the MQGs experienced a Luminous\nInfrared Galaxy (LIRG) phase that lasts for $\\sim$ 500 Myr, and half of them an\nUltra Luminous Infrared Galaxy (ULIRG) phase for $\\sim$ 100 Myr. We find that\nthe MQG population is almost assembled at $z$ $\\sim$ 1, and continues evolving\npassively with few additions to the population.\n", "  We estimate cluster masses and velocity dispersions for 123 clusters from\noptical spectroscopy to compare the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) mass proxy and\ndynamical masses. Our new survey, HeCS-SZ (Hectospec Cluster Survey of\nSZ-selected clusters), includes 7,721 new or remeasured redshifts from\nMMT/Hectospec observations of 24 SZ-selected clusters at redshifts\n$z$=0.05-0.20 and not in previous surveys. We supplement the Hectospec data\nwith spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and cluster data from the\nCluster Infall Regions in SDSS (CIRS) project and the Hectospec Cluster Survey\n(HeCS), our Hectospec survey of clusters selected by X-ray flux. We measure the\nscaling relation between velocity dispersion and SZ mass estimates from the\nintegrated Compton parameter for an SZ complete sample of 83 clusters. The\nobserved relation agrees very well with a simple virial scaling from mass\n(based on SZ) to velocity dispersion. The SZ mass estimates (calibrated with\nhydrostatic X-ray mass estimates) are not significantly biased. Further, the\nvelocity dispersion of cluster galaxies is consistent with the expected\nvelocity dispersion of dark matter particles, indicating that galaxies are good\ndynamical tracers (i.e., velocity bias is small). Significant mass bias in SZ\nmass estimates could relieve tension between cosmological results from Planck\nSZ cluster counts and Planck CMB data. However, the excellent agreement between\nour measured velocity dispersions and those predicted from a virial scaling\nrelation suggests that any SZ mass bias is too small to reconcile SZ and CMB\nresults. In principle, SZ mass bias and velocity bias of galaxies could\nconspire to yield good agreement, but the required velocity bias is\n$\\sigma_{galaxy}\\approx 0.77\\sigma_{DM}$, outside the range of plausible models\nof velocity bias in the literature.\n", "  We introduce a novel dark matter scenario where the visible sector and the\ndark sector share a common asymmetry. The two sectors are connected through an\nunstable mediator with baryon number one, allowing the standard model baryon\nasymmetry to be shared with dark matter via semi-annihilation. The present-day\nabundance of dark matter is then set by thermal freeze-out of this\nsemi-annihilation process, yielding an asymmetric version of the WIMP miracle\nas well as promising signals for indirect detection experiments. As a proof of\nconcept, we find a viable region of parameter space consistent with the\nobserved Fermi excess of GeV gamma rays from the galactic center.\n", "  $Z_{2}$ and Chern topological phases such as newly discovered quantum spin\nHall and original quantum Hall states hardly both co--exist in a single\nmaterial due to their contradictory requirement on the time--reversal symmetry\n(TRS). We show that although the TRS is broken in systems with a periodically\ndriving ac-field, an effective TRS can still be defined provided the ac--field\nis linearly polarized or certain other conditions are satisfied. The\ncontrollable TRS provides us with a route to manipulate $Z_{2} $ and Chern\ntopological phases in a single material by tuning the polarization of the\nac--field. To demonstrate the idea, we consider a generic honeycomb lattice\nmodel as a benchmark system that is relevant to electronic structures of\nseveral monolayered materials. Our calculation shows that not only the\ntransitions between $Z_{2}$ and Chern phases can be induced but also features\nsuch as the dispersion of the edge states can be controlled. This opens the\npossibility of manipulating various topological phases in a single material and\ncan be a promising approach to engineer some new electronic states of matter.\n", "  Escape of an early atmosphere from Titan, during which time NH3 could be\nconverted by photolysis into the present N2 dominated atmosphere, is an\nimportant problem in planetary science. Recently Gilliam and Lerman (2014)\nestimated escape driven by the surface temperature and pressure, which we show\ngave loss rates that are orders of magnitude too large. Their model, related to\nJeans escape from an isothermal atmosphere, was used to show that escape driven\nonly by surface heating would deplete the atmospheric inventory of N for a\nsuggested Titan accretion temperature of ~355 K. Therefore, they concluded that\nthe accretion temperature must be lower in order to retain the present Titan\natmosphere. Here we show that the near surface atmospheric temperature is\nessentially irrelevant for determining the atmospheric loss rate from Titan and\nthat escape is predominantly driven by solar heating of the upper atmosphere.\nWe also give a rough estimate of the escape rate in the early solar system\n(~10^4 kg/s) consistent with an inventory of nitrogen being available over the\ntime period suggested by Atreya et al. (1978) for conversion of NH3 into N2.\n", "  We study the graviton Regge trajectory in Holographic QCD as a model for high\nenergy scattering processes dominated by soft pomeron exchange. This is done by\nconsidering spin J fields from the closed string sector that are dual to\nglueball states of even spin and parity. In particular, we construct a model\nthat governs the analytic continuation of the spin J field equation to the\nregion of real J < 2, which includes the scattering domain of negative\nMaldelstam variable t. The model leads to approximately linear Regge\ntrajectories and is compatible with the measured values of 1.08 for the\nintercept and 0.25 GeV$^{-2}$ for the slope of the soft pomeron. The intercept\nof the secondary pomeron trajectory is in the same region of the subleading\ntrajectories, made of mesons, proposed by Donnachie and Landshoff, and should\ntherefore be taken into account.\n", "  We show that 4-point vector boson one-loop amplitudes, computed in ref.[1] in\nthe RNS formalism, around vacuum configurations with open unoriented strings,\npreserving at least N=1 SUSY in D=4, satisfy the correct supersymmetry Ward\nidentities, in that they vanish for non MHV configurations (++++) and (-+++).\nIn the MHV case (--++) we drastically simplify their expressions. We then study\nfactorisation and the limiting IR and UV behaviour and find some unexpected\nresults. In particular no massless poles are exposed at generic values of the\nmodular parameter. Relying on the supersymmetric properties of our bosonic\namplitudes, we extend them to manifestly supersymmetric super-amplitudes and\ncompare our results with those obtained in the D=4 hybrid formalism, pointing\nout difficulties in reconciling the two approaches for contributions from N=1,2\nsectors.\n", "  A new model of jet quenching in nuclear collisions, CUJET3.0, is constructed\nby generalizing the perturbative QCD based CUJET2.0 model to include two\ncomplementary non-perturbative features of the QCD confinement cross-over phase\ntransition near $T_c\\approx 160$ MeV: (1) the suppression of quark and gluon\ndegrees of freedom and (2) the emergence of chromo-magnetic monopole degrees of\nfreedom. Such a semi-Quark-Gluon-Monopole Plasma (sQGMP) microscopic scenario\nis tested by comparing predictions of the leading hadron nuclear modification\nfactors, $R^h_{AA}(p_T>10{\\rm GeV/c},\\sqrt{s})$, and their azimuthal elliptic\nasymmetry $v^h_2(p_T>10{\\rm GeV/c},\\sqrt{s})$ with available data on\n$h=\\pi,D,B$ jet fragments from nuclear collisions at RHIC($\\sqrt{s}=0.2$ ATeV)\nand LHC($\\sqrt{s}$=2.76 ATeV). The sQGMP model is shown to solve the long\nstanding $R_{AA}$ vs $v_2$ puzzle by predicting a maximum of the jet quenching\nparameter field $\\hat{q}(E,T)/T^3$ near $T_c$. The consistency of jet quenching\nwith observed bulk perfect fluidity is demonstrated by extrapolating the sQGMP\n$\\hat{q}$ down to thermal energy $E\\sim 3 T$ scales and showing that the sQGMP\nshear viscosity to entropy density ratio $\\eta/s \\approx T^3/\\hat{q}$ falls\nclose to the unitarity bound, $1/4\\pi$, in the range $(1-2)T_c$. Detailed\ncomparisons of CUJET2.0 and CUJET3.0 reveal that the remarkably different\n$\\hat{q}(T)$ could be consistent with the same $R_{AA}$ data and could only be\ndistinguished by anisotropy observables. These findings demonstrate clearly the\ninadequacy of focusing on the jet path averaged quantity $<\\hat{q}>$ as the\nonly relevant medium property to characterize jet quenching, and point to the\ncrucial roles of other essential factors, such as the chromo electric and\nmagnetic composites of the plasma, the screening masses and the running\ncouplings at multiple scales that all strongly influence jet energy loss.\n", "  High-energy neutrinos could be produced in the interaction of charged cosmic\nrays with matter or radiation surrounding astrophysical sources. Even with the\nrecent detection of extraterrestrial high-energy neutrinos by the IceCube\nexperiment, no astrophysical neutrino source has yet been discovered. Transient\nsources, such as gamma-ray bursts, core-collapse supernovae, or active galactic\nnuclei are promising candidates. Multi-messenger programs offer a unique\nopportunity to detect these transient sources. By combining the information\nprovided by the ANTARES neutrino telescope with information coming from other\nobservatories, the probability of detecting a source is enhanced, allowing the\npossibility of identifying a neutrino progenitor from a single detected event.\nA method based on optical and X-ray follow-ups of high-energy neutrino alerts\nhas been developed within the ANTARES collaboration. This program, denoted as\nTAToO, triggers a network of robotic optical telescopes (TAROT and ROTSE) and\nthe Swift-XRT with a delay of only a few seconds after a neutrino detection,\nand is therefore well-suited to search for fast transient sources. To identify\nan optical or X-ray counterpart to a neutrino signal, the images provided by\nthe follow-up observations are analysed with dedicated pipelines. A total of 42\nalerts with optical and 7 alerts with X-ray images taken with a maximum delay\nof 24 hours after the neutrino trigger have been analysed. No optical or X-ray\ncounterparts associated to the neutrino triggers have been found, and upper\nlimits on transient source magnitudes have been derived. The probability to\nreject the gamma-ray burst origin hypothesis has been computed for each alert.\n", "  We present the first simultaneous spectral energy distribution (SED) of M87\ncore at a scale of 0.4 arcsec ($\\sim 32\\, \\rm{pc}$) across the electromagnetic\nspectrum. Two separate, quiescent, and active states are sampled that are\ncharacterized by a similar featureless SED of power-law form, and that are thus\nremarkably different from that of a canonical active galactic nuclei (AGN) or a\nradiatively inefficient accretion source. We show that the emission from a jet\ngives an excellent representation of the core of M87 core covering ten orders\nof magnitude in frequency for both the active and the quiescent phases. The\ninferred total jet power is, however, one to two orders of magnitude lower than\nthe jet mechanical power reported in the literature. The maximum luminosity of\na thin accretion disc allowed by the data yields an accretion rate of $< 6\n\\times 10^{-5}\\, \\rm{M_\\odot \\, yr^{-1}}$, assuming 10% efficiency. This power\nsuffices to explain M87 radiative luminosity at the jet-frame, it is however\ntwo to three order of magnitude below that required to account for the jet's\nkinetic power. The simplest explanation is variability, which requires the core\npower of M87 to have been two to three orders of magnitude higher in the last\n200 yr. Alternatively, an extra source of power may derive from black hole\nspin. Based on the strict upper limit on the accretion rate, such spin power\nextraction requires an efficiency an order of magnitude higher than predicted\nfrom magnetohydrodynamic simulations, currently in the few hundred per cent\nrange.\n", "  Strongly lensed variable quasars can serve as precise cosmological probes,\nprovided that time delays between the image fluxes can be accurately measured.\nA number of methods have been proposed to address this problem. In this paper,\nwe explore in detail a new approach based on kernel regression estimates, which\nis able to estimate a single time delay given several datasets for the same\nquasar. We develop realistic artificial data sets in order to carry out\ncontrolled experiments to test of performance of this new approach. We also\ntest our method on real data from strongly lensed quasar Q0957+561 and compare\nour estimates against existing results.\n", "  Spreading phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and society. For example,\ndisease, rumor, and information spread over underlying social and information\nnetworks. It is well known that there is no threshold for epidemic models on\nscale-free networks; this suggests that disease can spread on such networks,\nregardless of how low the contact rate may be. In this paper, I consider six\nmodels with different contact and propagation mechanisms. Each model is\nanalyzed by degree-based mean-field theory. I show that the presence or absence\nof an outbreak threshold depends on the contact and propagation mechanism.\n", "  We present a recent definition of symmetry generating vector fields on\nmanifolds equipped with a first-order reductive Cartan geometry. We apply this\ndefinition to a number of spacetime geometries used in gravity theories and\nshow that it agrees with the usual notions of symmetry of affine,\nRiemann-Cartan, Riemannian, Weizenb\\\"ock and Finsler spacetimes.\n", "  We present a recent result on the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) limit of\nHorndeski's gravity theory and its consistency with solar system observations.\n", "  We investigate the structure of vortex-bound states in spin-singlet chiral\nsuperconductors with ($d_{x^2-y^2} \\pm i d_{xy}$)-wave and ($d_{xz} \\pm\nid_{yz}$)-wave pairing symmetries. It is found that vortices in the ($d_{xz}\n\\pm id_{yz}$)-wave state bind zero-energy states which are dispersionless along\nthe vortex line, forming a doubly degenerate Majorana flat band. Vortex-bound\nstates of ($d_{x^2-y^2} \\pm i d_{xy}$)-wave superconductors, on the other hand,\nexist only at finite energy. Using exact diagonalization and analytical\nsolutions of tight-binding Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonians, we compute the\nenergy spectrum of the vortex-bound states and the local density of states\naround the vortex and antivortex cores. We find that the tunneling conductance\npeak of the vortex is considerably broader than that of the antivortex. This\ndifference can be used as a direct signature of the chiral order parameter\nsymmetry.\n", "  Cosmological dynamics of scalar field with a monomial potential $\\phi^{n}$\nwith a general background equation of state is revisited. It is known that if\n$n$ is smaller than a critical value, the scalar field exhibits a coherent\noscillation and if $n$ is larger it obeys a scaling solution without\noscillation. We study in detail the case where $n$ is equal to the critical\nvalue, and find a peculiar scalar dynamics which is neither oscillating nor\nscaling solution, and we call it a pseudo scaling solution. We also discuss\ncosmological implications of a pseudo scaling scalar dynamics, such as the\ncurvature perturbation and the domain wall problem.\n", "  The conditions which determine whether a material behaves in a brittle or\nductile fashion on mechanical loading are still elusive and comprise a topic of\nactive research among materials physicists and engineers. In this study, we\npresent results of {\\em in silico} mechanical deformation experiments from two\nvery different model solids in two and three dimensions. The first consists of\nparticles interacting with isotropic potentials and the other has strongly\ndirection dependent interactions. We show that in both cases, the excess\nvibrational density of states is the fundamental quantity which characterises\nthe ductility of the material. Our results can be checked using careful\nexperiments on colloidal solids.\n", "  When embedded in dense cluster cores, intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs)\nacquire close stellar or stellar-remnant companions. These companions are not\nonly gravitationally bound, they tend to hierarchically isolate from other\ncluster stars through series of multibody encounters. In this paper, we study\nthe demographics of IMBH companions in compact star clusters through direct\n$N$-body simulation. We study clusters initially composed of $10^5$ or $2\\times\n10^5$ stars with IMBHs of 75 and 150 solar masses, and follow their evolution\nfor 6-10 Gyr. A tight innermost binary pair of IMBH and stellar object rapidly\nforms. The IMBH has a companion with orbital semi-major axis at least three\ntimes tighter than the second-most bound object over 90% of the time. These\ncompanionships have typical periods of order years and are subject to cycles of\nexchange and destruction. The most frequently observed, long-lived pairings\npersist for $\\sim 10^7$ yr. The demographics of IMBH companions in clusters are\ndiverse; they include both main sequence, giant stars, and stellar remnants.\nCompanion objects may reveal the presence of an IMBH in a cluster in one of\nseveral ways. Most-bound companion stars routinely suffer grazing tidal\ninteractions with the IMBH, offering a dynamical mechanism to produce repeated\nflaring episodes like those seen in the IMBH candidate HLX-1. Stellar winds of\ncompanion stars provide a minimum quiescent accretion rate for IMBHs, with\nimplications for radio searches for IMBH accretion in globular clusters.\nFinally, gravitational wave inspirals of compact objects are found to occur\nwith promising frequency.\n", "  We report the detection of a Cold Neptune m_planet=21+/-2MEarth orbiting a\n0.38MSol M dwarf lying 2.5-3.3 kpc toward the Galactic center as part of a\ncampaign combining ground-based and Spitzer observations to measure the\nGalactic distribution of planets. This is the first time that the complex\nreal-time protocols described by Yee et al. (2015), which aim to maximize\nplanet sensitivity while maintaining sample integrity, have been carried out in\npractice. Multiple survey and follow-up teams successfully combined their\nefforts within the framework of these protocols to detect this planet. This is\nthe second planet in the Spitzer Galactic distribution sample. Both are in the\nnear-to-mid disk and clearly not in the Galactic bulge.\n", "  A magnetic model for low/hard state (LHS) of black hole X-ray binaries\n(BHXBs),H1743-322 and GX 339-4, is proposed based on the transportation of\nmagnetic field from a companion into an accretion disk around a black hole\n(BH). This model consists of a truncated thin disk with an inner\nadvection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF). The spectral profiles of the sources\nare fitted in agreement with the data observed at four different dates\ncorresponding to the rising phase of the LHS. In addition, the association of\nthe LHS with quasi-steady jet is modelled based on transportation of magnetic\nfield, where the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) and Blandford-Payne (BP) processes are\ninvoked to drive the jets from BH and inner ADAF. It turns out that the steep\nradio/X-ray correlations observed in H1743-322 and GX 339-4 can be interpreted\nbased on our model.\n", "  Astronomical observations of recent years show that the universe at high\nredshifts about ten is densely populated by the early formed objects: bright\ngalaxies, quasars, gamma-bursters, and contains a lot of metals and dust. Such\nrich early formed varieties have not been expected in the standard model of\nformation of astrophysical objects. There is serious tension between the\nstandard theory and observations.We describe the model which naturally relaxes\nthis tension and nicely fits the data. The model naturally leads to creation of\ncosmologically significant antimatter which may be abundant even in the Galaxy.\nPhenomenological consequences of our scenario and possibility of distant\nregistration of antimatter are discussed.\n", "  We use a discrete, lattice-based model for two-dimensional materials to show\nthat M\\\"obius bands made with stretchable materials are less likely to crease\nor tear. This stems a delocalization of twisting strain that occurs if\nstretching is allowed. The associated low-energy configurations provide\nstrategic target shapes for the guided assembly of nanometer and micron scale\nM\\\"obius bands. To predict macroscopic band shapes for a given material, we\nestablish a connection between stretchability and relevant continuum moduli,\nleading to insight regarding the practical feasibility of synthesizing M\\\"obius\nbands from materials with continuum parameters that can be measured\nexperimentally or estimated by upscale averaging. To take advantage of\nstretchability in the case of M\\\"obius bands made of graphene, DNA, and other\neffectively unstretchable materials, we develop and explore a novel\narchitecture that uses the Chinese finger trap as a fundamental building block\nand imparts notable stretchability to otherwise unstretchable materials.\n", "  Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are the leading model to explain the\nphenomenology of short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs), which are among the most\nluminous explosions in the universe. Recent observations of long-lasting X-ray\nafterglows of SGRBs challenge standard paradigms and indicate that in a large\nfraction of events a long-lived neutron star (NS) may be formed rather than a\nblack hole. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these afterglows is\nnecessary in order to address the open questions concerning the nature of SGRB\ncentral engines. However, recent theoretical progress has been hampered by the\nfact that the timescales of interest for the afterglow emission are\ninaccessible to numerical relativity simulations. Here we present a detailed\nmodel to bridge the gap between numerical simulations of the merger process and\nthe relevant timescales for the afterglows, assuming that the merger results in\na long-lived NS. This model is formulated in terms of a set of coupled\ndifferential equations that follow the evolution of the post-merger system and\npredict its electromagnetic (EM) emission in a self-consistent way, starting\nfrom initial data that can be extracted from BNS merger simulations and taking\ninto account the most relevant radiative processes. Moreover, the model can\naccomodate the collapse of the remnant NS at any time during the evolution as\nwell as different scenarios for the prompt SGRB emission. A second major reason\nof interest for BNS mergers is that they are considered the most promising\nsource of gravitational waves (GWs) for detection with the advanced\nground-based detector network LIGO/Virgo coming online this year.\nMultimessenger astronomy with joint EM and GW observations of the merger and\npost-merger phase can greatly enhance the scientific output of either type of\nobservation. However, the actual benefit depends on ...\n", "  Recent observations indicate that in a large fraction of binary neutron star\n(BNS) mergers a long-lived neutron star (NS) may be formed rather than a black\nhole. Unambiguous electromagnetic (EM) signatures of such a scenario would\nstrongly impact our knowledge on how short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) and their\nafterglow radiation are generated. Furthermore, such EM signals would have\nprofound implications for multimessenger astronomy with joint EM and\ngravitational-wave (GW) observations of BNS mergers, which will soon become\nreality with the ground-based advanced LIGO/Virgo GW detector network starting\nits first science run this year. Here we explore such EM signatures based on\nthe model presented in a companion paper, which provides a self-consistent\nevolution of the post-merger system and its EM emission starting from an early\nbaryonic wind phase and resulting in a final pulsar wind nebula that is\nconfined by the previously ejected material. Lightcurves and spectra are\ncomputed for a wide range of post-merger physical properties and particular\nattention is paid to the emission in the X-ray band. In the context of SGRB\nafterglow modeling, we present X-ray lightcurves corresponding to the\n'standard' and the recently proposed 'time-reversal' scenario (SGRB prompt\nemission produced at the time of merger or at the time of collapse of the\nlong-lived NS). The resulting afterglow lightcurve morphologies include, in\nparticular, single and two-plateau features with timescales and luminosities\nthat are in good agreement with the observations by the Swift satellite.\nFurthermore, we compute the X-ray signal that should precede the SGRB in the\ntime-reversal scenario. If found, such a signal would represent smoking-gun\nevidence for this scenario. Finally, we find a bright, highly isotropic EM\ntransient signal peaking in the X-ray band ...\n", "  We carry out a detailed superspace analysis of the OPE of two N=2\nstress-tensor multiplets. Knowledge of the multiplets appearing in the\nexpansion, together with the two-dimensional chiral algebra description of N=2\nSCFTs, imply an analytic bound on the central charge c. This bound is valid for\nany N=2 SCFT regardless of its matter content and flavor symmetries, and is\nsaturated by the simplest Argyres-Douglas fixed point. We also present a\npartial conformal block analysis for the scalar superconformal primary of the\nmultiplet.\n", "  We show that the QCD Dirac spectrum at finite chemical potential using a\nmatrix model in the spontaneously broken phase, is amenable to a generic\n2-dimensional effective action. The eigenvalues form a droplet with strong\nscreening and plasmon oscillation. The droplet is threaded by a magnetic vortex\nwhich is at the origin of a Berry phase. For quarks in the complex or Dirac\nrepresentation, the anomalous transport in the droplet of eigenvalues bear some\nsimilarities with that in droplets of composite fermions at half filling\nsuggesting that the latters maybe Dirac fermions.\n", "  Recently, consensus-type problems have been formulated in the quantum domain.\nObtaining average quantum consensus consists in the dynamical symmetrization of\na multipartite quantum system while preserving the expectation of a given\nglobal observable. In this paper, two improved ways of obtaining consensus via\ndissipative engineering are introduced, which employ on quasi local preparation\nof mixtures of symmetric pure states, and show better performance in terms of\npurity dynamics with respect to existing algorithms. In addition, the first\nmethod can be used in combination with simple control resources in order to\nengineer pure Dicke states, while the second method guarantees a stronger type\nof consensus, namely single-measurement consensus. This implies that outcomes\nof local measurements on different subsystems are perfectly correlated when\nconsensus is achieved. Both dynamics can be randomized and are suitable for\nfeedback implementation.\n", "  Light and spectroscopy are among the most important and frequently taught\ntopics in introductory, college-level, general education astronomy courses.\nThis is due to the fact that the vast majority of observational data studied by\nastronomers arrives at Earth in the form of light. While there are many\nprocesses by which matter can emit and absorb light, Astro 101 courses\ntypically limit their instruction to the Bohr model of the atom and electron\nenergy level transitions. In this paper, we report on the development of a new\nLecture-Tutorial to help students learn about other processes that are\nresponsible for the emission and absorption of light, namely molecular\nrotations, molecular vibrations, and the acceleration of charged particles by\nmagnetic fields.\n", "  We explore the phenomenological consequences of general late-time\nmodifications of gravity in the quasi-static approximation, in the case where\ncold dark matter is non-minimally coupled to the gravitational sector. Assuming\nspectroscopic and photometric surveys with configuration parameters similar to\nthose of the Euclid mission, we derive constraints on our effective description\nfrom three observables: the galaxy power spectrum in redshift space,\ntomographic weak-lensing shear power spectrum and the correlation spectrum\nbetween the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and the galaxy distribution. In\nparticular, with $\\Lambda$CDM as fiducial model and a specific choice for the\ntime dependence of our effective functions, we perform a Fisher matrix analysis\nand find that the unmarginalized $68\\%$ CL errors on the parameters describing\nthe modifications of gravity are of order $\\sigma\\sim10^{-2}$--$10^{-3}$. We\nalso consider two other fiducial models. A nonminimal coupling of CDM enhances\nthe effects of modified gravity and reduces the above statistical errors\naccordingly. In all cases, we find that the parameters are highly degenerate,\nwhich prevents the inversion of the Fisher matrices. Some of these degeneracies\ncan be broken by combining all three observational probes.\n", "  We study the externally-driven motion of the domain walls (DWs)of the pi/2\ntype in (in-the-plane ordered) nanostripes of the crystalline cubic anisotropy.\nSuch DWs are much narrower than the transverse and vortex pi DWs of the\nsoft-magnetic nanostripes while propagating much faster, thus, enabling dense\npacking of magnetization domains and high speed processing of the many domain\nstates. The viscous current-driven motion of the DW with the velocity above\n1000m/s under the electric current of the density 10^12A/m2 is predicted to\ntake place in the nanostripes of the magnetite. Also, the viscous motion with\nthe velocity above 700m/s can be driven by the magnetic field according to our\nsolution to a 1D analytical model and the micromagnetc simulations. Such huge\nvelocities are achievable in the nanostripes of very small cross-sections (only\n100nm width and 10nm thickness). The fully stress driven propagation of the DW\nin the nanostripes of cubic magnetostrictive materials is predicted as well.\nThe strength of the DW pinning to the stripe notches and the thermal stability\nof the magnetization during the current flow are addressed.\n", "  We present experimental results on the conversion of a spin current into a\ncharge current by spin pumping into the Dirac cone with helical spin\npolarization of the elemental topological insulator (TI) {\\alpha}-Sn[1-3]. By\nangle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) we first confirm that the\nDirac cone at the surface of {\\alpha}-Sn (0 0 1) layers subsists after covering\nwith Ag. Then we show that resonant spin pumping at room temperature from Fe\nthrough Ag into {\\alpha}-Sn layers induces a lateral charge current that can be\nascribed to the Inverse Edelstein Effect[4-5]. Our observation of an Inverse\nEdelstein Effect length[5-6] much longer than for Rashba interfaces[5-10]\ndemonstrates the potential of the TI for conversion between spin and charge in\nspintronic devices. By comparing our results with data on the relaxation time\nof TI free surface states from time-resolved ARPES, we can anticipate the\nultimate potential of TI for spin to charge conversion and the conditions to\nreach it.\n", "  This paper reports on an investigation into the correlations between\nstudents' understandings of introductory astronomy concepts and the correctness\nand coherency of their written responses to targeted Lecture-Tutorial\nquestions. We assessed the correctness and coherency of responses from 454\ncollege-level, general education, introductory astronomy students enrolled in\ncourses taught in the spring of 2010, 2011, and 2012. We hypothesized that\nstudents who consistently provided responses with high levels of correctness\nand coherency would outperform students who did not on multiple measures of\nastronomy content knowledge. We compared students' correctness and coherency\nscores to their normalized gains on the Light and Spectroscopy Concept\nInventory (LSCI) and to their scores on closely-related exam items. Our\nanalysis revealed that no significant correlations exist between students'\ncorrectness and coherency scores and their LSCI gain scores or exam item\nscores. However, the participant group in our study did achieve high scores on\nthe LSCI and on closely-related exam items. We hypothesized that these\ndifferences are due to the discussions that take place between students which\nsuggests that instructors who teach with active engagement instructional\nstrategies should focus their implementation on ensuring that their students\nfully engage in the richest possible discourse.\n", "  We study ten galaxy groups and clusters suggested in the literature to be\n\"fossil system (FS)\" based on \\chandra\\ observations. According to the\n$M_{500}-T$ and $L_{\\rm X}-T$ relations, the gas properties of FSs are not\nphysically distinct from ordinary galaxy groups or clusters. We also first\nstudy the $f_{\\rm gas,~2500}-T$ relation and find that the FS exhibits same as\nordinary systems. The gas densities of FSs within $0.1r_{200}$, are $\\sim\n10^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$, which is the same order as galaxy clusters. The entropies\nwithin $0.1r_{200}$ ($S_{0.1r_{200}}$) of FSs are systematically lower than\nthose in ordinary galaxy groups which is consistent with previous report, but\nwe find their $S_{0.1r_{200}}-T$ relation is more similar to galaxy clusters.\nThe derived mass profiles of FSs are consistent with the Navarro, Frenk, \\&\nWhite model in $(0.1-1)r_{200}$, and the relation between scale radius $r_{\\rm\ns}$ and characteristic mass density $ta_{\\rm c}$ indicates the self-similarity\nof dark matter halos of FSs. The range of $r_{\\rm s}$ and $ta_{\\rm c}$ of FSs\nare also close to those of galaxy clusters. Therefore, FSs share more common\ncharacteristics with galaxy clusters. The special birth place of the FS makes\nit as a distinct galaxy system type.\n", "  In this paper, we apply a new statistical analysis technique, Mean Field\napproach to Bayesian Independent Component Analysis (MF-ICA), on galaxy\nspectral analysis. This algorithm can compress the stellar spectral library\ninto a few Independent Components (ICs), and galaxy spectrum can be\nreconstructed by these ICs. Comparing to other algorithms which decompose a\ngalaxy spectrum into a combination of several simple stellar populations,\nMF-ICA approach offers a large improvement in the efficiency. To check the\nreliability of this spectral analysis method, three different methods are used:\n(1) parameter-recover for simulated galaxies, (2) comparison with parameters\nestimated by other methods, and (3) consistency test of parameters from the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies. We find that our MF-ICA method not only can\nfit the observed galaxy spectra efficiently, but also can recover the physical\nparameters of galaxies accurately. We also apply our spectral analysis method\nto the DEEP2 spectroscopic data, and find it can provide excellent fitting for\nthose low signal-to-noise spectra.\n", "  Interactions between particles in quantum many-body systems can lead to\ncollective behavior described by hydrodynamics. One such system is the\nelectron-hole plasma in graphene near the charge neutrality point which can\nform a strongly coupled Dirac fluid. This charge neutral plasma of\nquasi-relativistic fermions is expected to exhibit a substantial enhancement of\nthe thermal conductivity, due to decoupling of charge and heat currents within\nhydrodynamics. Employing high sensitivity Johnson noise thermometry, we report\nthe breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law in graphene, with a thermal\nconductivity an order of magnitude larger than the value predicted by Fermi\nliquid theory. This result is a signature of the Dirac fluid, and constitutes\ndirect evidence of collective motion in a quantum electronic fluid.\n", "  The measurement of the large-scale B-mode polarization in the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) is a fundamental goal of future CMB experiments.\nHowever, because of unprecedented sensitivity, future CMB experiments will be\nmuch more sensitive to any imperfect modelling of the Galactic foreground\npolarization in the reconstruction of the primordial B-mode signal. We compare\nthe sensitivity to B-modes of different concepts of CMB satellite missions\n(LiteBIRD, COrE, COrE+, PRISM, EPIC, PIXIE) in the presence of Galactic\nforegrounds. In particular, we quantify the impact on the tensor-to-scalar\nparameter of incorrect foreground modelling in the component separation\nprocess. Using Bayesian fitting and Gibbs sampling, we perform the separation\nof the CMB and Galactic foreground B-modes. The recovered CMB B-mode power\nspectrum is used to compute the likelihood distribution of the tensor-to-scalar\nratio. We focus the analysis to the very large angular scales that can be\nprobed only by CMB space missions, i.e. the Reionization bump, where primordial\nB-modes dominate over spurious B-modes induced by gravitational lensing. We\nfind that fitting a single modified blackbody component for thermal dust where\nthe \"real\" sky consists of two dust components strongly bias the estimation of\nthe tensor-to-scalar ratio by more than 5{\\sigma} for the most sensitive\nexperiments. Neglecting in the parametric model the curvature of the\nsynchrotron spectral index may bias the estimated tensor-to-scalar ratio by\nmore than 1{\\sigma}. For sensitive CMB experiments, omitting in the foreground\nmodelling a 1% polarized spinning dust component may induce a non-negligible\nbias in the estimated tensor-to-scalar ratio.\n", "  We investigate the superfluid-insulator transition of one-dimensional\ninteracting Bosons in both deep and shallow periodic potentials. We compare a\ntheoretical analysis based on Monte-Carlo simulations in continuum space and\nLuttinger liquid approach with experiments on ultracold atoms with tunable\ninteractions and optical lattice depth. Experiments and theory are in excellent\nagreement. It provides a quantitative determination of the critical parameter\nfor the Mott transition and defines the regime of validity of widely used\napproximate models, namely the Bose-Hubbard and sine-Gordon models\n", "  Most stellar remnants so far have been found in binary systems, where they\ninteract with matter from their companions. Isolated neutron stars and black\nholes are difficult to find as they are dark, yet they are predicted to exist\nin our Galaxy in vast numbers.\n  We explored the OGLE-III database of 150 million objects observed in years\n2001-2009 and found 59 microlensing events exhibiting a parallax effect due to\nthe Earth's motion around the Sun. Combining parallax and brightness\nmeasurements from microlensing light curves with expected proper motions in the\nMilky Way, we identified 13 microlensing events which are consistent with\nhaving a white dwarf, neutron star or a black hole lens and we estimated their\nmasses and distances. The most massive of our black hole candidates has 9.3\nMSun and is at a distance of 2.4 kpc. The distribution of masses of our\ncandidates indicates a continuum in mass distribution with no mass gap between\nneutron stars and black holes. We also present predictions on how such events\nwill be observed by the astrometric Gaia mission.\n", "  A search for direct pair production of the supersymmetric partner of the top\nquark, decaying via a scalar tau to a nearly massless gravitino, has been\nperformed using 20 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at $\\sqrt{s}=8$\nTeV. The data were collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2012. Top\nsquark candidates are searched for in events with either two hadronically\ndecaying tau leptons, one hadronically decaying tau and one light lepton, or\ntwo light leptons. No significant excess over the Standard Model expectation is\nfound. Exclusion limits at 95% confidence level are set as a function of the\ntop squark and scalar tau masses. Depending on the scalar tau mass, ranging\nfrom the 87 GeV LEP limit to the top squark mass, lower limits between 490 GeV\nand 650 GeV are placed on the top squark mass within the model considered.\n", "  We study in Ising spin glasses the finite-size effects near the spin-glass\ntransition in zero field and at the de Almeida-Thouless transition in a field\nby Monte Carlo methods and by analytical approximations. In zero field, the\nfinite-size scaling function associated with the spin-glass susceptibility of\nthe Sherrington-Kirkpatrick mean-field spin-glass model is of the same form as\nthat of one-dimensional spin-glass models with power-law long-range\ninteractions in the regime where they can be a proxy for the Edwards-Anderson\nshort-range spin-glass model above the upper critical dimension. We also\ncalculate a simple analytical approximation for the spin-glass susceptibility\ncrossover function. The behavior of the spin-glass susceptibility near the de\nAlmeida-Thouless transition line has also been studied, but here we have only\nbeen able to obtain analytically its behavior in the asymptotic limit above and\nbelow the transition. We have also simulated the one-dimensional system in a\nfield in the non-mean-field regime to illustrate that when the Imry-Ma droplet\nlength scale exceeds the system size one can then be erroneously lead to\nconclude that there is a de Almeida-Thouless transition even though it is\nabsent.\n", "  A number of recent studies indicates a significant amount of ionized gas in a\nform of the hot gas halo around the Milky Way. The halo extends over the region\nof 100 kpc and may be acountable for the missing baryon mass. In this paper we\ncalculate the contribution of the proposed halo to the dispersion measure (DM)\nof the pulsars. The Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW), Maller & Bullock (MB) and\nFeldmann, Hooper & Gnedin (FHG) density distibutions are considered for the gas\nhalo. The data set includes pulsars with the distance known independently from\nthe DM, e.g. pulsars in globular clusters, LMC, SMC and pulsars with known\nparallax. The results exclude the NFW distribution for the hot gas, while the\nmore realistic MB and FHG models are compatible with the observed dispersion\nmeasure.\n", "  In an (Anti-) de Sitter space and a charged black hole the Schwinger effect\nis either enhanced by the Hawking radiation or suppressed by the negative\ncurvature. We use the contour integral method to calculate the production of\ncharged pairs in the global (A)dS space. The charge emission from near-extremal\nblack hole is found from the AdS geometry near the horizon and interpreted as\nthe Schwinger effect in a Rindler space with the surface gravity for the\nacceleration as well as the Schwinger effect in AdS space.\n", "  We analyzed a deep {\\it XMM-Newton} observation of the radio-quiet\n$\\gamma$-ray PSR J2055+2539. The spectrum of the X-ray counterpart is\nnon-thermal, with a photon index of $\\Gamma$=2.36$\\pm$0.14 (1$\\sigma$\nconfidence). We detected X-ray pulsations with a pulsed fraction of\n(25$\\pm$3)\\% and a sinusoidal shape. Taking into account considerations on the\n$\\gamma$-ray efficiency of the pulsar and on its X-ray spectrum, we can infer a\npulsar distance ranging from 450 pc to 750 pc. We found two different nebular\nfeatures associated to PSR J2055+2539 and protruding from it. The angle between\nthe two nebular main axes is $\\sim$ (162.8$\\pm$0.7)$^{\\circ}$. The main,\nbrighter feature is 12' long and $<$20\" thick, characterized by an asymmetry\nwith respect to the main axis that evolves with the distance from the pulsar,\npossibly forming a helical pattern. The secondary feature is 250\" $\\times$ 30\".\nBoth nebulae present an almost flat brightness profile with a sudden decrease\nat the end. The nebulae can be fitted either by a power-law model or a thermal\nbremsstrahlung model. A plausible interpretation of the brighter nebula is in\nterms of a collimated ballistic jet. The secondary nebula is most likely a\nclassical synchrotron-emitting tail.\n", "  We present $GalevNB$ (Galev for $N$-body simulations), an utility that\nconverts fundamental stellar properties of $N$-body simulations into\nobservational properties using the $GALEV$ (GAlaxy EVolutionary synthesis\nmodels) package, and thus allowing direct comparisons between observations and\n$N$-body simulations. It works by converting fundamental stellar properties,\nsuch as stellar mass, temperature, luminosity and metallicity into\nobservational magnitudes for a variety of filters of mainstream\ninstruments/telescopes, such as HST, ESO, SDSS, 2MASS, etc.), and into spectra\nthat spans from far-UV (90 $\\rm \\AA$) to near-IR (160 $\\rm \\mu$m). As an\napplication, we use $GalevNB$ to investigate the secular evolution of spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) and color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of a simulated star\ncluster over a few hundred million years. With the results given by $GalevNB$\nwe discover an UV-excess in the SED of the cluster over the whole simulation\ntime. We also identify four candidates that contribute to the FUV peak, core\nhelium burning stars, thermal pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TPAGB) stars,\nwhite dwarfs and naked helium stars.\n", "  The cross section for t t-bar production in the all-jets final state is\nmeasured in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV at the LHC with\nthe CMS detector, in data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 18.4\ninverse femtobarns. The inclusive cross section is found to be 275.6 +/- 6.1\n(stat) +/- 37.8 (syst) +/- 7.2 (lumi) pb. The normalized differential cross\nsections are measured as a function of the top quark transverse momenta, pt,\nand compared to predictions from quantum chromodynamics. The results are\nreported at detector, parton, and particle levels. In all cases, the measured\ntop quark pt spectra are significantly softer than theoretical predictions.\n", "  In this article, we construct both the\naxialvector-diquark-axialvector-diquark-antiquark type and\naxialvector-diquark-scalar-diquark-antiquark type interpolating currents, then\ncalculate the contributions of the vacuum condensates up to dimension-10 in the\noperator product expansion, and study the masses and pole residues of the\n$J^P={\\frac{1}{2}}^\\pm$ hidden-charm pentaquark states with the QCD sum rules\nin a systematic way. In calculations, we use the formula\n$\\mu=\\sqrt{M^2_{P}-(2{\\mathbb{M}}_c)^2}$ to determine the energy scales of the\nQCD spectral densities. We take into account the $SU(3)$ breaking effects of\nthe light quarks, and obtain the masses of the hidden charm pentaquark states\nwith the strangeness $S=0,\\,-1,\\,-2,\\,-3$, which can be confronted with the\nexperimental data in the future.\n", "  Complementary to ground-based laser interferometers, pulsar timing array\nexperiments are being carried out to search for nanohertz gravitational waves.\nUsing the world's most powerful radio telescopes, three major international\ncollaborations have collected $\\sim$10-year high precision timing data for tens\nof millisecond pulsars. In this paper we give an overview on pulsar timing\nexperiments, gravitational wave detection in the nanohertz regime, and recent\nresults obtained by various timing array projects.\n", "  By combining the Baeriswyl wavefunction with equilibrium and time-dependent\nvariational principles, we develop a non-equilibrium formalism to study quantum\nquenches for two dimensional spinless fermions with nearest-neighbour hopping\nand repulsion. The variational ground state energy and the short time dynamics\nagree convincingly with the results of numerically exact simulations. We find\nthat depending on the initial and final interaction strength, the quenched\nsystem either exhibits undamped oscillations or relaxes to a time independent\nsteady state. The time averaged expectation value of the CDW order parameter\nrises sharply when crossing from the steady state regime to the oscillating\nregime, indicating that the system, being non-integrable, shows signs of\nthermalization with an effective temperature above or below the equilibrium\ncritical temperature, respectively.\n", "  Through a simple procedure based on the Lu-Chipman decomposition [S-Y. Lu and\nR. C. Chipman, J. Opt. Soc. Am A 13, 1106 (1996)] any depolarizing Mueller\nmatrix can be transformed into a reduced form which accumulates the\ndepolarization and polarizance properties into a set of six parameters. The\nsimple structure of this reduced form provides straightforward ways for the\ngeneral characterization of Mueller matrices as well as for the analysis of\nsingular Mueller matrices.\n", "  We recently described an instability due to the nonlinear coupling of p-modes\nto g-modes and, as an application, we studied the stability of the tide in\ncoalescing binary neutron stars. Although we found that the tide is p-g\nunstable early in the inspiral and rapidly drives modes to large energies, our\nanalysis only accounted for three-mode interactions. Venumadhav, Zimmerman, and\nHirata showed that four-mode interactions must also be accounted for as they\nenter into the analysis at the same order. They found a near-exact cancellation\nbetween three- and four-mode interactions and concluded that while the tide in\nbinary neutron stars can be p-g unstable, the growth rates are not fast enough\nto impact the gravitational wave signal. Their analysis assumes that the linear\ntide is incompressible, which is true of the static linear tide (the m=0\nharmonic) but not the non-static linear tide (m=+/- 2). Here we account for the\ncompressibility of the non-static linear tide and find that the three- and\nfour-mode interactions no longer cancel. As a result, we find that the\ninstability can rapidly drive modes to significant energies (there is time for\nseveral dozen e-foldings of growth before the binary merges). We also show that\nlinear damping interferes with the cancellation and may further enhance the p-g\ngrowth rates. The early onset of the instability (at gravitational wave\nfrequencies near 50 Hz), the rapid growth rates, and the large number of\nunstable modes (> 10^3), suggest that the instability could impact the phase\nevolution of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars. Assessing its\nimpact will require an understanding of how the instability saturates and is\nleft to future work.\n", "  We present a versatile family of model galactic outflows including\nnon-uniform mass and energy source distributions, a gravitational potential\nfrom an extended mass source, and radiative losses. The model easily produces\nsteady-state wind solutions for a range of mass-loading factors, energy-loading\nfactors, galaxy mass and galaxy radius. We find that, with radiative losses\nincluded, highly mass-loaded winds must be driven at high central temperatures,\nwhereas low mass-loaded winds can be driven at low temperatures just above the\npeak of the cooling curve, meaning radiative losses can drastically affect the\nwind solution even for low mass-loading factors. By including radiative losses,\nwe are able to show that subsonic flows can be ignored as a possible mechanism\nfor expelling mass and energy from a galaxy compared to the more efficient\ntransonic solutions. Specifically, the transonic solutions with low\nmass-loading and high energy-loading are the most efficient. Our model also\nproduces low-temperature, high-velocity winds that could explain the prevalence\nof low-temperature material in observed outflows. Finally, we show that our\nmodel, unlike the well-known Chevalier & Clegg (1985) model, can reproduce the\nobserved linear relationship between wind X-ray luminosity and star formation\nrate (SFR) over a large range of SFR from $1-1000$ M$_{\\odot}$/yr assuming the\nwind mass-loading factor is higher for low-mass, and hence, low-SFR galaxies.\nWe also constrain the allowed mass-loading factors that can fit the observed\nX-ray luminosity vs. SFR trend, further suggesting an inverse relationship\nbetween mass-loading and SFR as explored in advanced numerical simulations.\n", "  Previous works suggested that the state transitions in an X-ray binary can be\ntriggered by accreting inverse magnetic field from its companion star. A key\npoint of this mechanism is the accretion and magnification of large-scale\nmagnetic fields from outer boundary of a thin disk. However, how such a process\ncan be realized is still an open question. In this work, we check this issue in\na realistic X-ray binary system. According to our calculations, a quite strong\ninitial magnetic field $B\\sim 10^2-10^3$ G is required in order to assure that\nthe large-scale magnetic field can be effectively dragged inward and magnified\nwith the accretion of gas. Thus, such a picture probably can be present in\nhigh-mass X-ray binaries possessing strong stellar magnetic field, e.g., Cyg\nX-1.\n", "  Samples for single-emitter spectroscopy are usually prepared by spin-coating\na dilute solution of emitters on a microscope cover slip of silicate based\nglass (such as quartz). Here, we show that both borosilicate glass and quartz\ncontain intrinsic defect colour centres that fluoresce when excited at 532 nm.\nIn a microscope image the defect emission is indistinguishable from spin-coated\nemitters. The emission spectrum is characterised by multiple peaks, most likely\ndue to coupling to a silica vibration with an energy of 160-180 meV. The\ndefects are single-photon emitters, do not blink, and have photoluminescence\nlifetimes of a few nanoseconds. Photoluminescence from such defects may\npreviously have been misinterpreted as originating from single nanocrystal\nquantum dots.\n", "  Analytical solutions to force-free electrodynamics around black holes are\nfundamental for building simple models of accretion disk and jet dynamics. We\npresent a (nonexhaustive) classification of complex highest-weight solutions to\nthe force-free equations in the near-horizon region of the extremal Kerr black\nhole. Several classes of real magnetically dominated or null solutions, either\naxisymmetric or nonaxisymmetric, are described which admit finite energy and\nangular momentum with respect to the asymptotically flat observer. Subtleties\nrelated to the velocity of light surface in the near-horizon region are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The Drell-Yan massive dilepton production in hadron-hadron collisions\nprovides a unique tool, complementary to Deep Inelastic Scattering, for\nimproving our understanding of hadronic substructure and in particular for\ntesting parton distributions. We will consider measurements of the differential\nand double-differential Drell-Yan cross sections from FNAL Tevatron up to CERN\nLHC energies and they will be compared to the predictions of perturbative QCD\ncalculations using most recent sets (CT14 and MMHT14) of parton distribution\nfunctions, as well as those provided by the statistical approach.\n", "  We present late-time multi-wavelength observations of Swift J1644+57,\nsuggested to be a relativistic tidal disruption flare (TDF). Our observations\nextend to >4 years from discovery, and show that 1.4 years after outburst the\nrelativistic jet switched-off on a timescale less than tens of days,\ncorresponding to a power-law decay faster than $t^{-70}$. Beyond this point\nweak X-rays continue to be detected at an approximately constant luminosity of\n$L_X \\sim 5 \\times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and are marginally inconsistent with\na continuing decay of $t^{-5/3}$, similar to that seen prior to the switch-off.\nHost photometry enables us to infer a black hole mass of $M_{BH}=3 \\times 10^6$\nM$_{\\odot}$, consistent with the late time X-ray luminosity arising from\nsub-Eddington accretion onto the black hole in the form of either an unusually\noptically faint AGN or a slowly varying phase of the transient. Optical/IR\nobservations show a clear bump in the light curve at timescales of 30-50 days,\nwith a peak magnitude (corrected for host galaxy extinction) of $M_R \\sim\n-22-23$. The luminosity of the bump is significantly higher than seen in other,\nnon-relativistic TDFs and does not match any re-brightening seen at X-ray or\nradio wavelengths. Its luminosity, light curve shape and spectrum are broadly\nsimilar to those seen in superluminous SNe, although subject to large\nuncertainties in the correction of the significant host extinction. We discuss\nthese observations in the context of both TDF and massive star origins for\nSwift J1644+5734 and other candidate relativistic tidal flares.\n", "  On the surface of 2D Topological insulators occur 1D quantum spin Hall(QSH)\nedge modes with Dirac like dispersion. Unlike quantum Hall(QH) edge modes which\noccur at high magnetic fields in 2DEGs, the occurrence of QSH edge modes is\nbecause of spin-orbit scattering in the bulk of the material. These QSH edge\nmodes are spin dependent and chiral- opposite spins move in opposing\ndirections. Electronic spin has larger decoherence and relaxation time than\ncharge- in view of this its expected that QSH edge modes will be more robust to\ndisorder and inelastic scattering than QH edge modes which are charge dependent\nand spin unpolarized. However, we notice no such advantage accrues to QSH edge\nmodes when subjected to same degree of contact disorder and/or inelastic\nscattering in similar setups as QH edge modes. In fact we observe that QSH edge\nmodes are more susceptible to inelastic scattering and contact disorder than QH\nedge modes. Further, while a single disordered contact has no effect on QH edge\nmodes it leads to a finite charge Hall current in case of quantum spin Hall\nedge modes and thus vanishing of pure quantum spin Hall effect. For more than a\nsingle disordered contact while quantum Hall states continue to remain immune\nto disorder, quantum spin Hall edge modes become more susceptible- the Hall\nresistance for quantum spin Hall effect changes sign with increasing disorder.\nIn case of many disordered contacts with inelastic scattering included while\nquantization of Hall edge modes holds, for quantum spin Hall edge modes- a\nfinite charge Hall current still flows. For quantum spin Hall edge modes in the\ninelastic scattering regime we distinguish between two cases: with spin-flip\nand without spin-flip scattering. Finally, while asymmetry in sample geometry\ncan have a deleterious effect on quantum spin Hall case it has no impact in\nquantum Hall case.\n", "  We study the spontaneous pair production, including the Schwinger mechanism\nand the Hawking radiation, of charged scalar and spinor particles from the near\nhorizon region of (near) extremal charged black holes in the probe field limit.\nThe pair production rate and the absorption cross section, as well as the\nretarded Green's functions of the probe fields are analytically computed.\nMoreover, the holographic description dual to the pair production is discussed.\n", "  We present an analysis of the ALMA long baseline science verification data of\nthe gravitational lens system SDP.81. We fit the positions of the brightest\nclumps at redshift z=3.042 and a possible AGN component of the lensing galaxy\nat redshift z=0.2999 in the band 7 continuum image using a canonical lens\nmodel, a singular isothermal ellipsoid plus an external shear. Then, we measure\nthe ratio of fluxes in some apertures at the source plane where the lensed\nimages are inversely mapped. We find that the aperture flux ratios of band 7\ncontinuum image are perturbed by 10-20 percent with a significance at 2 ~ 3\nsigma level. Moreover, we measure the astrometric shifts of multiply lensed\nimages near the caustic using the CO(8-7) line. Using a lens model best-fitted\nto the band 7 continuum image, we reconstruct the source image of the CO(8-7)\nline by taking linear combination of inverted quadruply lensed images. At the\n50th channel (rest-frame velocity 28.6 km/s) of the CO(8-7) line, we find an\nimprint of astrometric shifts of the order of 0.01 arcsec in the source image.\nBased on a semi-analytic calculation, we find that the observed anomalous flux\nratios and the astrometric shifts can be explained by intergalactic dark\nstructures in the line of sight. A compensated homogeneous spherical clump with\na mean surface mass density of the order of 10^8 solar mass h^-1 arcsec^-2 can\nexplain the observed anomaly and astrometric shifts simultaneously.\n", "  The $\\alpha$-particle light response of liquid scintillators based on linear\nalkylbenzene (LAB) has been measured with three different experimental\napproaches. In the first approach, $\\alpha$-particles were produced in the\nscintillator via $^{12}$C($n$,$\\alpha$)$^9$Be reactions. In the second\napproach, the scintillator was loaded with 2% of $^{\\mathrm{nat}}$Sm providing\nan $\\alpha$-emitter, $^{147}$Sm, as an internal source. In the third approach,\na scintillator flask was deployed into the water-filled SNO+ detector and the\nradioactive contaminants $^{222}$Rn, $^{218}$Po and $^{214}$Po provided the\n$\\alpha$-particle signal. The behavior of the observed $\\alpha$-particle light\noutputs are in agreement with each case successfully described by Birks' law.\nThe resulting Birks parameter $kB$ ranges from $(0.0066\\pm0.0016)$ cm/MeV to\n$(0.0076\\pm0.0003)$ cm/MeV. In the first approach, the $\\alpha$-particle light\nresponse was measured simultaneously with the light response of recoil protons\nproduced via neutron-proton elastic scattering. This enabled a first time a\ndirect comparison of $kB$ describing the proton and the $\\alpha$-particle\nresponse of LAB based scintillator. The observed $kB$ values describing the two\nlight response functions deviate by more than $5\\sigma$. The presented results\nare valuable for all current and future detectors, using LAB based scintillator\nas target, since they depend on an accurate knowledge of the scintillator\nresponse to different particles.\n", "  We examine the evolution of universe in $f(R,T)$ gravity where $R$ is the\nRicci curvature and $T$ is the trace of energy momentum tensor. We focus on the\nspecific form $f(R,T) = R+f(T)$ and explicitly find out the relation between\n$f(T)$ and state of equation $w$ by adiabatic condition. All possible modes of\nevolution of the scale factor for the five kinds of state of equation, $w= \\pm\n1, \\pm 1/3, 0$ are exhibited. We simulate numerically the plots of redshift\nversus distance modulus for three interesting modes and then obtain the good\nfitting curve compared with the astronomical observation data.\n", "  We report the discovery of transient radio emission from the nearby\noptically-discovered TDE ASASSN-14li (distance of 90 Mpc), making it the first\ntypical TDE detected in the radio, and unambiguously pointing to the formation\nof a non-relativistic outflow with a kinetic energy of $\\approx\n(4-10)\\times10^{47}$ erg, a velocity of $\\approx 12,000-36,000$ km s$^{-1}$,\nand a mass of $\\approx 3\\times10^{-5}-7\\times10^{-4}$ M$_{\\odot}$. We show that\nthe outflow was ejected on 2014 August 11--25, in agreement with an independent\nestimate of the timing of super-Eddington accretion based on the optical, UV,\nand X-ray observations, and that the ejected mass corresponds to about $1-10\\%$\nof the mass accreted in the super-Eddington phase. The temporal evolution of\nthe radio emission also uncovers the circumnuclear density profile,\n$\\rho(R)\\propto R^{-2.5}$ on a scale of about 0.01 pc, a scale that cannot be\nprobed via direct measurements even in the nearest SMBHs. Our discovery of\nradio emission from the nearest well-studied TDE to date, with a radio\nluminosity lower than all previous limits, indicates that non-relativistic\noutflows are ubiquitous in TDEs, and that future, more sensitive, radio surveys\nwill uncover similar events.\n", "  We present the first spectroscopic analysis of the faint and compact stellar\nsystem Draco II (Dra II, M_V=-2.9+/-0.8, r_h=19^{+8}_{-6} pc), recently\ndiscovered in the Pan-STARRS1 3{\\pi} survey. The observations, conducted with\nDEIMOS on the Keck II telescope, establish some of its basic characteristics:\nthe velocity data reveal a narrow peak with 9 member stars at a systemic\nheliocentric velocity <v_r>=-347.6^{+1.7}_{-1.8} km/s, thereby confirming Dra\nII is a satellite of the Milky Way; we infer a velocity dispersion with\n\\sigma_{vr}=2.9+/-2.1 km/s (<8.4 km/s at the 95% confidence level), which\nimplies log_{10}(M_{1/2})=5.5^{+0.4}_{-0.6} and\nlog_{10}((M/L)_{1/2})=2.7^{+0.5}_{-0.8}, in Solar units; furthermore, very weak\nCalcium triplet lines in the spectra of the high signal-to-noise member stars\nimply [Fe/H]<-2.1, whilst variations in the line strengths of two stars with\nsimilar colours and magnitudes suggest a metallicity spread in Dra II. These\nnew data cannot clearly discriminate whether Draco II is a star cluster or\namongst the faintest, most compact, and closest dwarf galaxies. However, the\nsum of the three --- individually inconclusive --- pieces of evidence presented\nhere, seems to favour the dwarf galaxy interpretation.\n", "  Within the framework of the Standard Model of particle physics and standard\ncosmology, observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon\nAcoustic Oscillations (BAO) set stringent bounds on the sum of the masses of\nneutrinos. If these bounds are satisfied, the upcoming KATRIN experiment which\nis designed to probe neutrino mass down to $\\sim 0.2$ eV will observe only a\nnull signal. We show that the bounds can be relaxed by introducing new\ninteractions for the massive active neutrinos, making neutrino masses in the\nrange observable by KATRIN compatible with cosmological bounds. Within this\nscenario, neutrinos convert to new stable light particles by resonant\nproduction of intermediate states around a temperature of $T\\sim$ keV in the\nearly Universe, leading to a much less pronounced suppression of density\nfluctuations compared to the standard model.\n", "  The study of kiloparsec-scale dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) will provide\nimportant clues to understand the co-evolution between the host galaxies and\ntheir central supermassive black holes undergoing a merging process. We present\nlong-slit spectroscopy of the J0038$+$4128, a kiloparsec-scale dual AGN\ncandidate discovered by Huang et al. recently, using the Yunnan Faint Object\nSpectrograph and Camera (YFOSC) mounted on Li-Jiang 2.4-m telescope at Yunnan\nobservatories. From the long-slit spectra, we find that the average relative\nline-of-sight (LOS) velocity between the two nuclei (J0038$+$4128N and\nJ0038$+$4128S) is about 150 km s$^{-1}$. The LOS velocities of the emission\nlines from the gas ionized by the nuclei activities and of the absorption lines\nfrom stars governed by the host galaxies for different regions of the\nJ0038$+$4128 exhibit the same trend. The same velocities trend indicates that\nthe gaseous disks are co-rotating with the stellar disks in this ongoing merge\nsystem. We also find several knots/giant HII regions scattered around the two\nnuclei with strong star formation revealed by the observed line ratios from the\nspectra. Those regions are also detected clearly in HST $F336W/U$-band and HST\n$F555W/V$-band images.\n", "  We study one- and two-photon scattering from a qubit embedded in a\none-dimensional waveguide in the presence of modal dispersion. We use a\nresolvent based analysis and utilize techniques borrowed from the Lee model\nstudies. Modal dispersion leads to atom-photon bound states which necessitate\nthe use of multichannel scattering theory. We present multichannel scattering\nmatrix elements in terms of the solution of a Fredholm integral equation of the\nsecond kind. Through the use of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation, we derive an\ninfinite series of Feynman diagrams that represent the solution to the integral\nequation. We use the Feynman diagrams as vertex correction terms to come up\nwith closed form formulas that successfully predict the trapping rate of a\nphoton in the atom-photon bound state. We verify our formalism through\nKrylov-subspace based numerical studies with pulsed excitations. Our results\nprovide the tools to calculate the complex correlations between scattered\nphotons in a dispersive environment.\n", "  The characteristics of dust matter in space-time models, admitting the\nexistence of privilege coordinate systems are given, where the single-particle\nHamilton-Jacobi equation can be integrated by the method of complete separation\nof variables. The resulting functional form of the 4-velocity field and energy\ndensity of matter for all types of spaces under consideration is presented.\n", "  The transport of gas towards the centre of galaxies is critical for black\nhole feeding and, indirectly, it can control active galactic nucleus (AGN)\nfeedback. We have quantified the molecular gas inflow in the central R<1kpc of\nM51 to be 1 Msun/yr, using a new gravitational torque map and the molecular gas\ntraced by the PdBI Arcsecond Whirlpool Survey (PAWS). The nuclear stellar bar\nis responsible for this gas inflow. We have also used torque profiles to\nestimate the location of dynamical resonances, suggesting a corotation for the\nbar at R~20\", and a corotation for the spiral at R~100\". We demonstrate how\nimportant it is to correct 3.6um images for dust emission in order to compute\ngravitational torques, and we carefully examine further sources of uncertainty.\nOur observational measurement of gas inflow can be compared with nuclear\nmolecular outflow rates and provide useful constraints for numerical\nsimulations.\n", "  Powerful relativistic jets in radio galaxies are capable of driving strong\noutflows but also inducing star-formation by pressure-triggering collapse of\ndense clouds. We review theoretical work on negative and positive active\ngalactic nuclei feedback, discussing insights gained from recent hydrodynamical\nsimulations of jet-driven feedback on galaxy scales that are applicable to\ncompact radio sources. The simulations show that the efficiency of feedback and\nthe relative importance of negative and positive feedback depends strongly on\ninterstellar medium properties, especially the column depth and spatial\ndistribution of clouds. Negative feedback is most effective if clouds are\ndistributed spherically and individual clouds have small column depths, while\npositive feedback is most effective if clouds are predominantly in a disc-like\nconfiguration.\n", "  We consider the stability properties of test particles moving along circular\norbits around a mass with quadrupole. We show that the quadrupole modifies\ndrastically the properties of an accretion disk made of such test particles.\n", "  We present approximate exterior and interior solutions of Einstein's\nequations which describe the gravitational field of a static deformed mass\ndistribution. The deformation of the source is taken into account up to the\nfirst order in the quadrupole.\n", "  We consider the problem of orbital stability of the motion of a test particle\nin the restricted three-body problem, by using the orbital moment and its time\nderivative. We show that it is possible to get some insight into the stability\nproperties of the motion of test particles, without knowing the exact solutions\nof the motion equations.\n", "  NELIOTA is a new ESA activity launched at the National Observatory of Athens\nin February 2015 aiming to determine the distribution and frequency of small\nnear-earth objects (NEOs) via lunar monitoring. The project involves upgrading\nthe 1.2m Kryoneri telescope at the National Observatory of Athens, procuring\ntwo fast-frame cameras, and developing a software system, which will control\nthe telescope and the cameras, process the images and automatically detect NEO\nimpacts. NELIOTA will provide a web-based user interface, where the impact\nevents will be reported and made available to the scientific community and the\ngeneral public. The objective of this 3.5 year activity is to design, develop\nand implement a highly automated lunar monitoring system, which will conduct an\nobserving campaign for 2 years in search of NEO impact flashes on the Moon. The\nimpact events will be verified, characterised and reported. The 1.2m telescope\nwill be capable of detecting flashes much fainter than current, small-aperture,\nlunar monitoring telescopes. NELIOTA is therefore expected to characterise the\nfrequency and distribution of NEOs weighing as little as a few grams.\n", "  We present the results from a study of the morphologies of moderate\nluminosity X-ray selected AGN host galaxies in comparison to a carefully\nmass-matched control sample at 0.5 < z < 3 in the CANDELS GOODS-S field. We\napply a multi-wavelength morphological decomposition analysis to these two\nsamples and report on the differences between the morphologies as fitted from\nsingle Sersic and multiple Sersic models, and models which include an\nadditional nuclear point-source component. Thus, we are able to compare the\nwidely adopted single Sersic fits from previous studies to the results from a\nfull morphological decomposition, and address the issue of how biased the\ninferred properties of AGN hosts are by a potential nuclear contribution from\nthe AGN itself. We find that the AGN hosts are mixed systems which have higher\nbulge fractions than the control sample in our highest redshift bins at the\n>99.7% confidence level, according to all model fits even those which adopt a\npoint-source component. This serves to alleviate concerns that previous, purely\nsingle Sersic, analyses of AGN hosts could have been spuriously biased towards\nhigher bulge fractions. This dataset allows us to further probe the physical\nnature of these point-source components; we find no strong correlation between\nthe point-source component and AGN activity, and that these point-source\ncomponents are best modelled physically by nuclear starbursts. Our analysis of\nthe bulge and disk fractions of these AGN hosts in comparison to a mass-matched\ncontrol sample reveals a similar morphological evolutionary track for both the\nactive and non-active populations, providing further evidence in favour of a\nmodel where AGN activity is triggered by secular processes.\n", "  The Multicolor Simultaneous Camera for studying Atmospheres of Transiting\nexoplanets (MuSCAT) is an optical three-band (g'_2-, r'_2-, and z_{s,2}-band)\nimager that was recently developed for the 188cm telescope at Okayama\nAstrophysical Observatory with the aim of validating and characterizing\ntransiting planets. In a pilot observation with MuSCAT we observed a primary\ntransit of HAT-P-14b, a high-surface gravity (g_p=38 ms^{-2}) hot Jupiter\naround a bright (V=10) F-type star. From a 2.9 hr observation, we achieved the\nfive-minute binned photometric precisions of 0.028%, 0.022%, and 0.024% in the\ng'_2, r'_2, and z_{s,2} bands, respectively, which provided the highest-quality\nphotometric data for this planet. Combining these results with those of\nprevious observations, we search for variations of transit timing and duration\nover five years as well as variations of planet-star radius ratio (R_p/R_s)\nwith wavelengths, but can find no considerable variation in any parameters. On\nthe other hand, using the transit-subtracted light curves we simulate\nachievable measurement error of R_p/R_s with MuSCAT for various planetary\nsizes, assuming three types of host stars: HAT-P-14, the nearby K dwarf\nHAT-P-11, and the nearby M dwarf GJ1214. Comparing our results with the\nexpected atmospheric scale heights, we find that MuSCAT is capable of probing\nthe atmospheres of planets as small as a sub-Jupiter (R_p ~6 R_Earth) around\nHAT-P-14 in all bands, a Neptune (~4R_Earth) around HAT-P-11 in all bands, and\na super-Earth (~2.5R_Earth) around GJ1214 in r'_2 and z_{s,2} bands. These\nresults promise that MuSCAT will produce fruitful scientific outcomes in the K2\nand TESS era.\n", "  In the last decade, increasing attention has been drawn to high precision\noptical experiments, which push resolution and accuracy of the measured\nquantities beyond their current limits. This challenge requires to place\noptical elements (e.g. mirrors, lenses, etc.) and to steer light beams with\nsub-nanometer precision. Existing methods for beam direction computing in\nresonators, e.g. iterative ray tracing or generalized ray transfer matrices,\nare either computationally expensive or rely on overparametrized models of\noptical elements. By exploiting Fermat's principle, we develop a novel method\nto compute the steady-state beam configurations in resonant optical cavities\nformed by spherical mirrors, as a function of mirror positions and curvature\nradii. The proposed procedure is based on the geometric Newton method on matrix\nmanifold, a tool with second order convergence rate that relies on a second\norder model of the cavity optical length. As we avoid coordinates to\nparametrize the beam position on mirror surfaces, the computation of the second\norder model does not involve the second derivatives of the parametrization.\nWith the help of numerical tests, we show that the convergence properties of\nour procedure hold for non-planar polygonal cavities, and we assess the\neffectiveness of the geometric Newton method in determining their\nconfigurations with high degree of accuracy and negligible computational\neffort.\n", "  Depletion interactions arise from entropic forces, and their ability to\ninduce aggregation and even ordering of colloidal particles through\nself-assembly is well established, especially for spherical colloids. We vary\nthe size and concentration of penetrable hard sphere depletants in a system of\ncuboctahedra, and we show how depletion changes the preferential facet\nalignment of the colloids and thereby selects different crystal structures.\nMoreover, we explain the cuboctahedra phase behavior using perturbative free\nenergy calculations. We find that cuboctahedra can form a stable simple cubic\nphase, and, remarkably, that the stability of this phase can only be\nrationalized by considering the effects of both the colloid and depletant\nentropy. We corroborate our results by analyzing how the depletant\nconcentration and size affect the emergent directional entropic forces and\nhence the effective particle shape. We propose the use of depletants as a means\nof easily changing the effective shape of self-assembling anisotropic colloids.\n", "  We present a statistical analysis of the first four seasons from a\n\"second-generation\" microlensing survey for extrasolar planets, consisting of\nnear-continuous time coverage of 8 deg$^2$ of the Galactic bulge by the OGLE,\nMOA, and Wise microlensing surveys. During this period, 224 microlensing events\nwere observed by all three groups. Over 12% of the events showed a deviation\nfrom single-lens microlensing, and for $\\sim$1/3 of those the anomaly is likely\ncaused by a planetary companion. For each of the 224 events we have performed\nnumerical ray-tracing simulations to calculate the detection efficiency of\npossible companions as a function of companion-to-host mass ratio and\nseparation. Accounting for the detection efficiency, we find that\n$55^{+34}_{-22}\\%$ of microlensed stars host a snowline planet. Moreover, we\nfind that Neptunes-mass planets are $\\sim10$ times more common than\nJupiter-mass planets. The companion-to-host mass ratio distribution shows a\ndeficit at $q\\sim10^{-2}$, separating the distribution into two companion\npopulations, analogous to the stellar-companion and planet populations, seen in\nradial-velocity surveys around solar-like stars. Our survey, however, which\nprobes mainly lower-mass stars, suggests a minimum in the distribution in the\nsuper-Jupiter mass range, and a relatively high occurrence of brown-dwarf\ncompanions.\n", "  We report here the study, in the radio band, of a sample of candidates of\nhigh Rotation Measure (RM). The point-like objects (at kpc scale) were selected\nby choosing unpolarised sources from the NVSS which show significant linear\npolarisation at 10.45 GHz. Assuming in-band depolarisation, this feature\nsuggests the presence of a very dense medium surrounding them in a combination\nof a strong magnetic field. Further single-dish observations were performed\nwith the 100-m Effelsberg telescope to characterise the SEDs of the sample and\nto well determine their RM in the 11 to 2 cm wavelength range. Besides, a\nwideband (L, S, C and X band ) full polarisation observational campaign was\nperformed at the JVLA facility. It allows us to analyse the in-band RM for the\nmost extreme objects. Some Effelsberg results and analysis, and preliminary\nJVLA results are presented. The observations reveal that sources with young,\nnewly growing, radio components at high frequency (i.e. GPS and HFP sources)\nare characterised by a really dense and/or a magnetised medium that strongly\nrotates the polarisation angle at the different frequencies, leading to a\nhigh-RM.\n", "  In this paper we study the lepton favor violating decay channels of the\nneutral Higgs bosons of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model into a lepton\nand an anti-lepton of different flavor. We work in the context of the most\ngeneral flavor mixing scenario in the slepton sector, in contrast to the\nminimal flavor violation assumption more frequently used. Our analytic\ncomputation is a one-loop diagrammatic one, but in contrast to the full\none-loop computation which is usually referred to the physical slepton mass\nbasis, we use here instead the Mass Insertion Approximation (MIA) which uses\nthe electroweak interaction slepton basis and treats perturbatively the mass\ninsertions changing slepton flavor. By performing an expansion in powers of the\nexternal momenta in the relevant form factors, we will be able to separate\nexplicitly in the analytic results the leading non-decoupling (constant at\nasymptotically large sparticle masses) and the next to leading decoupling\ncontributions (decreasing with the sparticle masses). Our final aim is to\nprovide a set of simple analytic formulas for the form factors and the\nassociated effective vertices, that we think may be very useful for future\nphenomenological studies of the lepton flavor violating Higgs boson decays, and\nfor their comparison with data. The accuracy of the numerical results obtained\nwith the MIA are also analyzed and discussed here in comparison with the full\none-loop results. Our most optimistic numerical estimates for the three neutral\nHiggs boson decays channels into $\\tau$ and $\\mu$ leptons, searching for their\nmaximum rates that are allowed by present constraints from $\\tau \\to \\mu\n\\gamma$ data and beyond Standard Model Higgs boson searches at the LHC, are\nalso included.\n", "  This talk adds more detail to the proposed TianQin mission \\cite{TQ}. The\nresponse of TianQin to a binary source is an important problem for the\nexperiment. Here we present the detail of the response function of an equal-arm\nMichelson interferometer to the gravitation waves of a binary source with a\ncircular orbit.\n", "  By use of mainly the exact diagonalization and the level spectroscopy method,\nwe investigate the ground-state phase diagrams of the $S=1/2$ distorted diamond\ntype quantum spin chain with the monomer-monomer interactions and/or\nferromagnetic interactions for the zero magnetic field case, as well as the\n$M=M_{\\rm s}/3$ case and the $M=(2/3)M_{\\rm s}$ case, where $M$ is the total\nmagnetization and $M_{\\rm s}$ is the saturation magnetization. The\nmagnetization plateau at $M=M_{\\rm s}/3$ vanishes in the region where the\nferromagnetic interaction is rather strong. The monomer-monomer interaction\nremarkably stabilizes the magnetization plateau at $M=(2/3)M_{\\rm s}$.\n", "  Employing mainly numerical methods, we explore the ground-state phase diagram\nof an anisotropic $S=1/2$ ladder, in which leg interactions are uniform and\nisotropic, while rung interactions are alternating and have a common Ising-type\nanisotropy. We determine the phase diagram in the case where $J_{\\rm leg}=0.2$\n(antiferromagnetic), $J_{\\rm rung}=-1.0$ (ferromagnetic) and $|J_{\\rm\nrung}'|\\!\\leq\\!1.0$, the first one being the magnitude of the leg interaction\nand the second and third ones those of the rung interactions, which are\nalternating. It is emphasized that the system has a frustration when $J_{\\rm\nrung}'$ is positive. We find that, in the frustrated region, the Haldane state\nappears as the ground state even when the Ising character of rung interactions\nis strong. This appearance of the Haldane phase is contrary to the ordinary\nsituation, and it is called the inversion phenomenon concerning the interaction\nanisotropy. We also find that an incommensurate state becomes the ground state\nin a portion of the Haldane phase region.\n", "  Ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) probably originate in extreme\nconditions in which extra dimension effects might be important. In this paper\nwe calculate the correction in black hole accretion mechanisms due to extra\ndimension effects in the static and rotating cases. A parametrization of the\nexternal Kerr horizons in both cases is presented and analysed. We use previous\ncalculations of upper limits on the UHECR flux to set limits on the UHECR\nproduction efficiency of nine sources. The upper limit on the UHECR luminosity\ncalculation is based on GeV-TeV gamma-ray measurements. The total luminosity\ndue to the accretion mechanism is compared to the upper limit on UHECRs. The\ndependence of the UHECR production efficiency upper limit on black hole mass is\nalso presented and discussed\n", "  We study the metric perturbations in the context of restricted $f(R)$\ngravity, in which a parameter for deviation from the full diffeomorphisms of\nspace-time is introduced. We demonstrate that one can choose the parameter to\nremove the induced anisotropic stress, which is present in the usual $f(R)$\ngravity. Moreover, to prevent instability for the vector and tensor metric\nperturbations, some constraints on the model are obtained.\n", "  Late on July 23, 2012, the STEREO-A spacecraft encountered a fast forward\nshock driven by a coronal mass ejection launched from the Sun earlier that same\nday. The estimated travel time of the disturbance ($\\sim 20$ hrs), together\nwith the massive magnetic field strengths measured within the ejecta ($>\n100$nT), made it one of the most extreme events observed during the space era.\nIn this study, we examine the properties of the shock wave. Because of an\ninstrument malfunction, plasma measurements during the interval surrounding the\nCME were limited, and our approach has been modified to capitalize on the\navailable measurements and suitable proxies, where possible. We were able to\ninfer the following properties. First, the shock normal was pointing\npredominantly in the radial direction (${\\bf n} = 0.97 {\\bf e}_r -0.09 {\\bf\ne}_t -0.23 {\\bf e}_n$). Second, the angle between ${\\bf n}$ and the upstream\nmagnetic field, $\\theta_{Bn}$, was estimated to be $\\approx 34^{\\circ}$, making\nthe shock \"quasi-parallel,\" and supporting the idea of an earlier\n\"preconditioning\" ICME. Third, the shock speed was estimated to be $\\approx\n3300$ km s$^{-1}$. Fourth, the sonic Mach number, $M_s$, for this shock was\n$\\sim 28$. We support these results with an idealized numerical simulation of\nthe ICME. Finally, we estimated the change in ram pressure upstream of the\nshock to be $\\sim 5$ times larger than the pressure from the energetic\nparticles, suggesting that this was not a standard \"steady-state\" cosmic-ray\nmodified shock (CRMS). Instead it might represent an early, transient phase in\nthe evolution of the CRMS.\n", "  It is well known that incident photons carrying momentum hk exert a positive\nphoton pressure. But if light is impinging from a negative refractive medium in\nwhich hk is directed towards the source of radiation, should light insert a\nphoton \"tension\" instead of a photon pressure? Using an ab initio method that\ntakes the underlying microstructure of a material into account, we find that\nwhen an electromagnetic wave propagates from one material into another, the\nelectromagnetic stress at the boundary is in fact indeterminate if only the\nmacroscopic parameters are specified. Light can either pull or push the\nboundary, depending not only on the macroscopic parameters but also on the\nmicroscopic lattice structure of the polarizable units that constitute the\nmedium. Within the context of effective medium approach, the lattice effect is\nattributed to electrostriction and magnetostriction which can be accounted for\nby the Helmholtz stress tensor if we employ the macroscopic fields to calculate\nthe boundary optical stress.\n", "  The perturbation method is proposed to obtain the effective delayed neutron\nfraction (\\b{eta}eff) of a cylindrical highly enriched uranium reactor. Based\non the reactivity measurements with and without a sample at a designable\nposition using the positive periodic technique, the reactor reactivity\nperturbation {\\Delta}\\r{ho} of the sample in \\b{eta}eff units is measured. The\nsimulation of the perturbation experiments are performed by MCNP program. The\nPERT card is used to provide the difference dk of effective neutron\nmultiplication factors with and without the sample inside the reactor. Based on\nthe relationship between the effective multiplication factor and the\nreactivity, the equation \\b{eta}eff =dk/{\\Delta}\\r{ho} is derived. In this\npaper, the reactivity perturbations of 13 metal samples at the designable\nposition of the reactor are measured and calculated. The average \\b{eta}eff\nvalue of the reactor is given as 0.00645, and the standard uncertainty is 3.0%.\nAdditionally, the perturbation experiments for \\b{eta}eff can be used to\nevaluate the reliabilities of the delayed neutron parameters. This work showed\nthat the delayed neutron data of 235U and 238U from G.R.Keepin's publication\nare more reliable than those from ENDF-B6.0, ENDF-B7.0, JENDL3.3 and CENDL2.2.\n", "  We study the phenomenology of the exotic Higgs bosons in the Georgi-Machacek\nmodel at future electron-positron colliders such as the International Linear\nCollider (ILC), assuming the collision energies of 500 GeV and 1 TeV. We show\nthat the existence of the neutral and singly-charged Higgs bosons in the 5-plet\nrepresentation under the custodial $SU(2)_V$ symmetry can be readily identified\nby studying various energy and invariant mass distributions of the $W^+W^-Z$\nfinal state. Moreover, their masses can be determined with sufficiently high\nprecision to test the mass degeneracy, a feature due to the custodial symmetry\nof the model. A synergy between such searches at the ILC and the doubly-charged\nHiggs search at the LHC will make the 5-plet Higgs boson study more\ncomprehensive.\n", "  Raman spectroscopy is used to study magnetic excitations in the quasi one\ndimensional $S=1/2$ quantum spin systems Cu(Qnx)(Cl$_{1-x}$Br$_x$)$_2$. The low\nenergy spectrum is found to be dominated by a two-magnon continuum as expected\nfrom the numerical calculations for the Heisenberg spin ladder model. The\ncontinuum shifts to higher energies as more Br is introduced. The cutoff of the\nscattering increases faster than the onset indicating that the increase of\nexchange constant along the leg is the main effect on the magnetic properties.\nThe upper and lower continuum thresholds are measured as a function of Br\ncontent across the entire range and compared to estimates based on previous\nbulk studies. We observe small systematic deviations that are discussed.\n", "  Explicit high-order non-canonical symplectic particle-in-cell algorithms for\nclassical particle-field systems governed by the Vlasov-Maxwell equations are\ndeveloped. The algorithm conserves a discrete non-canonical symplectic\nstructure derived from the Lagrangian of the particle-field system, which is\nnaturally discrete in particles. The electromagnetic field is\nspatially-discretized using the method of discrete exterior calculus with\nhigh-order interpolating differential forms for a cubic grid. The resulting\ntime-domain Lagrangian assumes a non-canonical symplectic structure. It is also\ngauge invariant and conserves charge. The system is then solved using a\nsplitting method discovered by He et al., which produces five exactly-soluable\nsub-systems, and high-order structure- preserving algorithms follow by\ncombinations. The explicit, high-order, and conservative nature of the\nalgorithms is especially suitable for long-term simulations of particle-field\nsystems with extremely large number of degrees of freedom on massively parallel\nsupercomputers. The algorithms have been tested and verified by the two physics\nproblems, i.e., the nonlinear Landau damping and the electron Bernstein wave.\n", "  Keck OSIRIS/LGSAO observations of the ultraluminous galaxy IRAS~23365+3604\nresolve a circumnuclear bar (or irregular disk) of semimajor axis 0.42\" (520\npc) in Paschen-alpha emission. The line-of-sight velocity of the ionized gas\nincreases from the northeast toward the southwest; this gradient is\nperpendicular to the photometric major axis of the infrared emission. Two pairs\nof bends in the zero-velocity line are detected. The inner bend provides\nevidence for gas inflow onto the circumnuclear disk/bar structure. We interpret\nthe gas kinematics on kiloparsec scales in relation to the molecular gas disk\nand multiphase outflow discovered previously. In particular, the fast component\nof the outflow (detected previously in line wings) is not detected, adding\nsupport to the conjecture that the fast wind originates well beyond the\nnucleus. These data directly show the dynamics of gas inflow and outflow in the\ncentral kiloparsec of a late-stage, gas-rich merger and demonstrate the\npotential of integral field spectroscopy to improve our understanding of the\nrole of gas flows during the growth phase of bulges and supermassive black\nholes.\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate a single $^{133}\\text{Cs}$\nimpurity in the center of a trapped $^{87}\\text{Rb}$ Bose-Einstein condensate.\nWithin a zero-temperature mean-field description we provide a one-dimensional\nphysical intuitive model which involves two coupled differential equations for\nthe condensate and the impurity wave function, which we solve numerically. With\nthis we determine within the equilibrium phase diagram spanned by the intra-\nand inter-species coupling strength, whether the impurity is localized at the\ntrap center or expelled to the condensate border. In the former case we find\nthat the impurity induces a bump or dip on the condensate for an attractive or\na repulsive Rb-Cs interaction strength, respectively. Conversely, the\ncondensate environment leads to an effective mass of the impurity which\nincreases quadratically for small interspecies interaction strength.\nAfterwards, we investigate how the impurity imprint upon the condensate wave\nfunction evolves for two quench scenarios. At first we consider the case that\nthe harmonic confinement is released. During the resulting time-of-flight\nexpansion it turns out that the impurity-induced bump in the condensate wave\nfunction starts decaying marginally, whereas the dip decays with a\ncharacteristic time scale which decreases with increasing repulsive\nimpurity-BEC interaction strength. Secondly, once the attractive or repulsive\ninterspecies coupling constant is switched off, we find that white-shock waves\nor bi-solitons emerge which both oscillate within the harmonic confinement with\na characteristic frequency.\n", "  We investigate the transition radiation on a periodically deformed interface\nbetween two dielectric media. Under the assumption that the dielectric\npermittivities of the media are close, a formula is derived for the\nspectral-angular distribution of the radiated energy in the general case of\nnon-static profile function for the separating boundary. In particular, the\nlatter includes the case of surface waves propagating along the boundary. The\nnumerical examples are given for triangular grating and for sinusoidal profile.\nWe show that instead of a single peak in the backward transition radiation on a\nflat interface, for periodic interface one has a set of peaks. The number and\nthe locations of the peaks depend on the incidence angle of the charge and on\nthe period of the interface. The conditions are specified for their appearance.\n", "  We present the first stellar density profile of the Milky Way bulge reaching\nlatitude $b=0^\\circ$. It is derived by counting red clump stars within the\ncolour\\--magnitude diagram constructed with the new PSF-fitting photometry from\nVISTA Variables in the V\\'\\i a L\\'actea (VVV) survey data. The new stellar\ndensity map covers the area between $|l|\\leq 10^\\circ$ and $|b|\\leq 4.5^\\circ$\nwith unprecedented accuracy, allowing to establish a direct link between the\nstellar kinematics from the Giraffe Inner Bulge Spectroscopic Survey (GIBS) and\nthe stellar mass density distribution. In particular, the location of the\ncentral velocity dispersion peak from GIBS matches a high overdensity in the\nVVV star count map. By scaling the total luminosity function (LF) obtained from\nall VVV fields to the LF from Zoccali et al.(2003), we obtain the first fully\nempirical estimate of the mass in stars and remnants of the Galactic bulge.\n  The Milky Way bulge stellar mass within ($|b|<9.5^\\circ$, $|l|<10^\\circ$) is\n$2.0\\pm0.3\\times 10^{10}M_{\\odot}$.\n", "  An exoplanet's structure and composition are first-order controls of the\nplanet's habitability. We explore which aspects of bulk terrestrial planet\ncomposition and interior structure affect the chief observables of an\nexoplanet: its mass and radius. We apply these perturbations to the Earth, the\nplanet we know best. Using the mineral physics toolkit BurnMan to\nself-consistently calculate mass-radius models, we find that core radius,\npresence of light elements in the core and an upper-mantle consisting of\nlow-pressure silicates have the largest effect on the final calculated mass at\na given radius, none of which are included in current mass-radius models. We\nexpand these results provide a self-consistent grid of compositionally as well\nas structurally constrained terrestrial mass-radius models for quantifying the\nlikelihood of exoplanets being \"Earth-like.\" We further apply this grid to\nKepler-36b, finding that it is only ~20% likely to be structurally similar to\nthe Earth with Si/Fe = 0.9 compared to Earth's Si/Fe = 1 and Sun's Si/Fe =\n1.19.\n", "  In the present paper, we find a system of non-linear ODEs that gives\nrotationally invariant solutions to the Kapustin-Witten equations in\n4-dimensional Euclidean space. We explicitly solve these ODEs in some special\ncases and find decaying rational solutions, which provide solutions to the\nKapustin-Witten equations. The imaginary parts of the solutions are singular.\nBy rescaling, we find some limit behavior for these singular solutions. In\naddition, for any integer $k$, we can construct a 5$|k|$ dimensional family of\n$C^1$ solutions to the Kapustin-Witten equations on Euclidean space, again with\nsingular imaginary parts. Moreover, we find solutions to the Kapustin-Witten\nequations over $S^3\\times (0,+\\infty)$ with the Nahm pole boundary condition.\n", "  We argue that the COMET experiment --- a dedicated experiment for the\n$\\mu$-$e$ conversion search --- can be a powerful facility to search for heavy\nneutrinos in the mass range $1\\,{\\rm MeV} \\lesssim M \\lesssim 100\\,{\\rm MeV}$.\nThe stopped muons captured by the target nuclei or decaying in orbit are\nefficiently produce heavy neutrinos via the active-sterile mixing. The produced\nheavy neutrinos then decay to electron-positron pair (plus an active neutrino),\nwhich events are clearly seen by the cylindrical drift chamber surrounding the\ntarget. The expected sensitivity is comparable to the PS191 bound when the\nCOMET experiment achieves $\\sim 10^{17}$ stopping muons in the target.\n", "  We propose a variant scenario of spontaneous baryogenesis from asymmetric\ninflaton based on current-current interactions between the inflaton and matter\nfields with a non-zero B-L charge. When the inflaton starts to oscillate around\nthe minimum after inflation, it may lead to excitation of a CP-odd component,\nwhich induces an effective chemical potential for the B-L number through the\ncurrent-current interactions. We study concrete inflation models and show that\nthe spontaneous baryogenesis scenario can be naturally implemented in the\nchaotic inflation in supergravity.\n", "  The possibility that some meteoroids in the size range 1 - 20 meters are\nrubble piles i.e. assembles of boulders of various sizes held together only by\nsmall van der Waals forces, is investigated. Such meteoroids are expected to\nstart disrupting into individual pieces during the atmospheric entry at very\nlow dynamic pressures of ~ 25 Pa, even before the onset of ablation. The\nheterogeneous bodies as Almahata Sitta (asteroid 2008 TC3) and Benesov are\nprimary candidates for rubble piles. Nevertheless, by analyzing the\ndeceleration, wake, and light curve of the Benesov bolide, we found that the\nmeteoroid disruption started only at a height of 70 km under dynamic pressure\nof 50 kPa. No evidence for a very early fragmentation was found also for the\nChelyabinsk event.\n", "  It is shown that high-energy astrophysical neutrinos observed in the IceCube\nexperiment can be produced by protons accelerated in extragalactic Type IIn\nsupernova remnants by shocks propagating in the dense circumstellar medium. The\nnonlinear diffusive shock acceleration model is used for description of\nparticle acceleration. We calculate the neutrino spectrum produced by an\nindividual Type IIn supernova and the spectrum of neutrino background produced\nby IIn supernovae in the expanding Universe. We also found that the arrival\ndirection of one Icecube neutrino candidate (track event 47) is at 1.35$^{\\circ\n}$ from Type IIn supernova 2005bx.\n", "  Complete gauge-fixing beyond perturbation theory in non-Abelian gauge\ntheories is a non-trivial problem. This is particularly evident in covariant\ngauges, where the Gribov-Singer ambiguity gives an explicit formulation of the\nproblem. In practice, this is a problem if gauge-dependent quantities between\ndifferent methods, especially lattice and continuum methods, should be\ncompared: Only when treating the Gribov-Singer ambiguity in the same way is the\ncomparison meaningful. To provide a better basis for such a comparison the\nstructure of the first Gribov region in Landau gauge, a subset of all possible\ngauge copies satisfying the perturbative Landau gauge condition, will be\ninvestigated. To this end, lattice gauge theory will be used to investigate a\ntwo-dimensional projection of the region for SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in two,\nthree, and four dimensions for a wide range of volumes and discretizations.\n", "  We present a comprehensive discussion of renormalisation of 3-point functions\nof scalar operators in conformal field theories in general dimension. We have\npreviously shown that conformal symmetry uniquely determines the momentum-space\n3-point functions in terms of certain integrals involving a product of three\nBessel functions (triple-K integrals). The triple-K integrals diverge when the\ndimensions of operators satisfy certain relations and we discuss how to obtain\nrenormalised 3-point functions in all cases. There are three different types of\ndivergences: ultralocal, semilocal and nonlocal, and a given divergent triple-K\nintegral may have any combination of them. Ultralocal divergences may be\nremoved using local counterterms and this results in new conformal anomalies.\nSemilocal divergences may be removed by renormalising the sources, and this\nresults in CFT correlators that satisfy Callan-Symanzik equations with beta\nfunctions. In the case of non-local divergences, it is the triple-K\nrepresentation that is singular, not the 3-point function. Here, the CFT\ncorrelator is the coefficient of the leading nonlocal singularity, which\nsatisfies all the expected conformal Ward identities. Such correlators exhibit\nenhanced symmetry: they are also invariant under dual conformal transformations\nwhere the momenta play the role of coordinates. When both anomalies and beta\nfunctions are present the correlators exhibit novel analytic structure\ncontaining products of logarithms of momenta. We illustrate our discussion with\nnumerous examples, including free field realisations and AdS/CFT computations.\n", "  Asteroseismology allows for deriving precise values of surface gravity of\nstars. The accurate asteroseismic determinations now available for large number\nof stars in the Kepler fields can be used to check and calibrate surface\ngravities that are currently being obtained spectroscopically for a huge\nnumbers of stars targeted by large-scale spectroscopic surveys, such as the\non-going Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST)\nGalactic survey. The LAMOST spectral surveys have obtained a large number of\nstellar spectra in the Kepler fields. Stellar atmospheric parameters of those\nstars have been determined with the LAMOST Stellar Parameter Pipeline at Peking\nUniversity (LSP3), by template matching with the MILES empirical spectral\nlibrary. In the current work, we compare surface gravities yielded by LSP3 with\nthose of two asteroseismic samples - the largest sample from Huber et al.\n(2014) and the most accurate sample from Hekker et al. (2012, 2013). We find\nthat LSP3 surface gravities are in good agreement with asteroseismic values of\nHekker et al. (2012, 2013), with a dispersion of about 0.2 dex. Except for a\nfew cases, asteroseismic surface gravities of Huber et al. (2014) and LSP3\nspectroscopic values agree for a wide range of surface gravities. However, some\npatterns of differences can be identified upon close inspection. Potential ways\nto further improve the LSP3 spectroscopic estimation of stellar atmospheric\nparameters in the near future are briefly discussed. The effects of effective\ntemperature and metallicity on asteroseismic determinations of surface\ngravities for giant stars are also discussed.\n", "  Type Ia supernovae, with their remarkably homogeneous light curves and\nspectra, have been used as standardizable candles to measure the accelerating\nexpansion of the Universe. Yet, their progenitors remain elusive. Common\nexplanations invoke a degenerate star (white dwarf) which explodes upon\nreaching close to the Chandrasekhar limit, by either steadily accreting mass\nfrom a companion star or violently merging with another degenerate star. We\nshow that circumstellar interaction in young Galactic supernova remnants can be\nused to distinguish between these single and double degenerate progenitor\nscenarios. Here we propose a new diagnostic, the Surface Brightness Index,\nwhich can be computed from theory and compared with Chandra and VLA\nobservations. We use this method to demonstrate that a double degenerate\nprogenitor can explain the decades-long flux rise and size increase of the\nyoungest known Galactic SNR G1.9+0.3. We disfavor a single degenerate scenario.\nWe attribute the observed properties to the interaction between a steep ejecta\nprofile and a constant density environment. We suggest using the upgraded VLA\nto detect circumstellar interaction in the remnants of historical Type Ia\nsupernovae in the Local Group of galaxies. This may settle the long-standing\ndebate over their progenitors.\n", "  Jets are observed as radio emission in active galactic nuclei and during the\nlow/hard state in X-ray binaries (XRBs), but their contribution at higher\nfrequencies has been uncertain. We study the dynamics of jets in XRBs using the\ngeneral-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic code HARM. We calculate the\nhigh-energy spectra and variability properties using a general-relativistic\nradiative transport code based on grmonty. We find the following signatures of\njet emission (i) a significant gamma-ray peak above ~10^22 Hz, (ii) a break in\nthe optical/UV spectrum, with a change in luminosity from L ~ nu^0 to L ~ nu,\nfollowed by another break at higher frequencies where the spectrum roughly\nreturns to L ~ nu^0, and (iii) a pronounced synchrotron peak near or below\n~10^14 Hz indicates that a significant fraction of any observed X-ray emission\noriginates in the jet. We investigate the variability during a large-scale\nmagnetic field inversion in which the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) jet is quenched and\na new transient hot reconnecting plasmoid is launched by the reconnecting\nfield. The ratio of the gamma-rays to X-rays changes from L_gamma / L_X > 1 in\nthe BZ jet to L_gamma / L_X < 1 during the launching of the transient plasmoid.\n", "  There are numerous examples of radio sources with various sizes which\nsurprisingly exhibit very similar morphology. This observational fact helped to\ncreate a standard evolutionary model in which young and small radio-loud active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) called gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) sources and\ncompact steep spectrum (CSS) sources, become large-scale radio objects.\nHowever, many details of this evolutionary process are still unclear. We\nexplored evolution scenarios of radio-loud AGN using new radio, optical and\nX-ray data of so far unstudied low luminosity compact (LLC) sources and we\nsummarize the results in this paper. Our studies show that the evolutionary\ntrack is very 'personalized' although we can mention common factors affecting\nit. These are interaction with the ambient medium and AGN power. The second\nfeature affects the production of the radio jets which if they are weak are\nmore vulnerable for instabilities and disruption. Thus not all GPS and CSS\nsources will be able to develop large scale morphologies. Many will fade away\nbeing middle-aged (10^5 years). It seems that only radio strong, high\nexcitation compact AGN can be progenitors of large-scale FRII radio sources.\n", "  We present results from an analysis of all data taken by the BICEP2 & Keck\nArray CMB polarization experiments up to and including the 2014 observing\nseason. This includes the first Keck Array observations at 95 GHz. The maps\nreach a depth of 50 nK deg in Stokes $Q$ and $U$ in the 150 GHz band and 127 nK\ndeg in the 95 GHz band. We take auto- and cross-spectra between these maps and\npublicly available maps from WMAP and Planck at frequencies from 23 GHz to 353\nGHz. An excess over lensed-LCDM is detected at modest significance in the\n95x150 $BB$ spectrum, and is consistent with the dust contribution expected\nfrom our previous work. No significant evidence for synchrotron emission is\nfound in spectra such as 23x95, or for correlation between the dust and\nsynchrotron sky patterns in spectra such as 23x353. We take the likelihood of\nall the spectra for a multi-component model including lensed-LCDM, dust,\nsynchrotron and a possible contribution from inflationary gravitational waves\n(as parametrized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$), using priors on the\nfrequency spectral behaviors of dust and synchrotron emission from previous\nanalyses of WMAP and Planck data in other regions of the sky. This analysis\nyields an upper limit $r_{0.05}<0.09$ at 95% confidence, which is robust to\nvariations explored in analysis and priors. Combining these $B$-mode results\nwith the (more model-dependent) constraints from Planck analysis of CMB\ntemperature plus BAO and other data, yields a combined limit $r_{0.05}<0.07$ at\n95% confidence. These are the strongest constraints to date on inflationary\ngravitational waves.\n", "  Accretion disks around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in active galactic\nnuclei contain stars, stellar mass black holes, and other stellar remnants,\nwhich perturb the disk gas gravitationally. The resulting density perturbations\nin turn exert torques on the embedded masses causing them to migrate through\nthe disk in a manner analogous to the behavior of planets in protoplanetary\ndisks. We determine the strength and direction of these torques using an\nempirical analytic description dependent on local disk gradients, applied to\ntwo different analytic, steady-state disk models of SMBH accretion disks. We\nfind that there are radii in such disks where the gas torque changes sign,\ntrapping migrating objects. Our analysis shows that major migration traps\ngenerally occur where the disk surface density gradient changes sign from\npositive to negative, around 20--300$R_{\\rm g}$, where $R_{\\rm g}=2GM/c^{2}$ is\nthe Schwarzschild radius. At these traps, massive objects in the AGN disk can\naccumulate, collide, scatter, and accrete. Intermediate mass black hole\nformation is likely in these disk locations, which may lead to preferential gap\nand cavity creation at these radii. Our model thus has significant implications\nfor SMBH growth as well as gravitational wave source populations.\n", "  We study in a bottom-up approach the theoretically consistent description of\nadditional resonances in the electroweak sector beyond the discovered Higgs\nboson as simplified models. We focus on scalar and tensor resonances. Our\nformalism is suited for strongly coupled models, but can also be applied to\nweakly interacting theories. The spurious degrees of freedom of tensor\nresonances that would lead to bad high-energy behavior are treated using a\ngeneralization of the Stuckelberg formalism. We calculate scattering amplitudes\nfor vector-boson and Higgs boson pairs. The high-energy region is regulated by\nthe T-matrix unitarization procedure, leading to amplitudes that are well\nbehaved on the whole phase space. We present numerical results for complete\npartonic processes that involve resonant vector-boson scattering, for the\ncurrent and upcoming runs of LHC.\n", "  We revisit a study of local renormalization group (RG) with background gauge\nfields incorporated using the AdS/CFT correspondence. Starting with a\n$(d+1)$-dimensional bulk gravity coupled to scalars and gauge fields, we derive\na local RG equation from a flow equation by working in the Hamilton-Jacobi\nformulation of the bulk theory. The Gauss's law constraint associated with\ngauge symmetry plays an important role. RG flows of the background gauge fields\nare governed by vector $\\beta$-functions, and some interesting properties of\nthem are known to follow. We give a systematic rederivation of them on the\nbasis of the flow equation. Fixing an ambiguity of local counterterms in such a\nmanner that is natural from the viewpoint of the flow equation, we determine\nall the coefficients uniquely appearing in the trace of the stress tensor for\n$d=4$. A relation between a choice of schemes and a Virial current is\ndiscussed. As a consistency check, these are found to satisfy the integrability\nconditions of local RG transformations. From these results, we are led to a\nproof of a holographic $c$-theorem by finding out a full family of schemes\nwhere a trace anomaly coefficient is related with a holographic $c$-function.\n", "  Compact steep spectrum (CSS) and GHz-peaked spectrum (GPS) radio sources\nrepresent a large fraction of the extragalactic objects in flux density-limited\nsamples. They are compact, powerful radio sources whose synchrotron peak\nfrequency ranges between a few hundred MHz to several GHz. CSS and GPS radio\nsources are currently interpreted as objects in which the radio emission is in\nan early evolutionary stage. In this contribution I review the radio properties\nand the physical characteristics of this class of radio sources, and the\ninterplay between their radio emission and the ambient medium of the host\ngalaxy.\n", "  Rotationally fissioned asteroids produce unbound daughter asteroids that have\nvery similar heliocentric orbits. Backward integration of their current\nheliocentric orbits provides an age of closest proximity that can be used to\ndate the rotational fission event. Most asteroid pairs follow a predicted\ntheoretical relationship between the primary spin period and the mass ratio of\nthe two pair members that is a direct consequence of the YORP-induced\nrotational fission hypothesis. If the progenitor asteroid has strength,\nasteroid pairs may have high mass ratios with possibly fast rotating primaries.\nHowever, secondary fission leaves the originally predicted trend unaltered. We\nalso describe the characteristics of pair members produced by four alternative\nroutes from a rotational fission event to an asteroid pair. Unlike direct\nformation from the event itself, the age of closest proximity of these pairs\ncannot generally be used to date the rotational fission event since\nconsiderable time may have passed.\n", "  We study the spherically symmetric collapsing star in terms of dynamical\ninstability. We take the framework of extended teleparallel gravity with\nnon-diagonal tetrad, power-law form of model presenting torsion and matter\ndistribution as non-dissipative anisotropic fluid. The vanishing shear scalar\ncondition is adopted to search the insights of collapsing star. We apply first\norder linear perturbation scheme to metric, matter and $f(T)$ functions. The\ndynamical equations are formulated under this perturbation scheme to develop\ncollapsing equation for finding dynamical instability limits in two regimes\nsuch as Newtonian and post-Newtonian. We obtain constraint free solution of\nperturbed time dependent part with the help of vanishing shear scalar. The\nadiabatic index exhibits the instability ranges through second dynamical\nequation which depend on physical quantities such as density, pressure\ncomponents, perturbed parts of symmetry of star, etc. We also develop some\nconstraints on positivity of these quantities and obtain instability ranges to\nsatisfy the dynamical instability condition.\n", "  We present observations of four rapidly rising (t_{rise}~10d) transients with\npeak luminosities between those of supernovae (SNe) and superluminous SNe\n(M_{peak}~-20) - one discovered and followed by the Palomar Transient Factory\n(PTF) and three by the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). The light curves\nresemble those of SN 2011kl, recently shown to be associated with an\nultra-long-duration gamma ray burst (GRB), though no GRB was seen to accompany\nour SNe. The rapid rise to a luminous peak places these events in a unique part\nof SN phase space, challenging standard SN emission mechanisms. Spectra of the\nPTF event formally classify it as a Type II SN due to broad Halpha emission,\nbut an unusual absorption feature, which can be interpreted as either high\nvelocity Halpha (though deeper than in previously known cases) or Si II (as\nseen in Type Ia SNe), is also observed. We find that existing models of white\ndwarf detonations, CSM interaction, shock breakout in a wind (or steeper CSM)\nand magnetar spindown can not readily explain the observations. We consider the\npossibility that a \"Type 1.5 SN\" scenario could be the origin of our events.\nMore detailed models for these kinds of transients and more constraining\nobservations of future such events should help better determine their nature.\n", "  Abundance studies of solar-type stars revealed a small fraction of objects\nwith extreme depletion of beryllium. We investigate the possible link between\nthe beryllium depletion and the presence of companions. The classical methods\n(radial velocity, astrometry, imaging) used to search for binary companions\nwere exploited. We also performed a chemical analysis to identify binaries by\nthe alteration in abundances that is produced by the accretion of material lost\nby a former evolved companion. We found that all the four previously\ninvestigated stars that were found to be ultra--depleted in Be are binaries. In\ntwo cases the companion is a white dwarf, and in the other two cases the\ncompanion might be a white dwarf or a main-sequence star. One new barium star\nwas identified. We speculate that the interaction with the white dwarf\nprogenitor caused an alteration in the abundance pattern of the star, which\nresulted in severe beryllium depletion. Possible mechanisms such as\nthermohaline mixing, episodic accretion, and rotational mixing are discussed.\nWe also briefly discuss predictions for validating this scenario\n", "  We study the distribution and evolution of highly ionised intergalactic\nmetals in the Evolution and Assembly of Galaxies and their Environment (EAGLE)\ncosmological, hydrodynamical simulations. EAGLE has been shown to reproduce a\nwide range of galaxy properties while its subgrid feedback was calibrated\nwithout considering gas properties. We compare the predictions for the column\ndensity distribution functions (CDDFs) and cosmic densities of SiIV, CIV, NV,\nOVI and NeVIII absorbers with observations at redshift z = 0 to ~ 6 and find\nreasonable agreement, although there are some differences. We show that the\ntypical physical densities of the absorbing gas increase with column density\nand redshift, but decrease with the ionization energy of the absorbing ion. The\ntypical metallicity increases with both column density and time. The fraction\nof collisionally ionized metal absorbers increases with time and ionization\nenergy. While our results show little sensitivity to the presence or absence of\nAGN feedback, increasing/decreasing the efficiency of stellar feedback by a\nfactor of two substantially decreases/increases the CDDFs and the cosmic\ndensities of the metal ions. We show that the impact of the efficiency of\nstellar feedback on the CDDFs and cosmic densities is largely due to its effect\non the metal production rate. However, the temperatures of the metal absorbers,\nparticularly those of strong OVI, are directly sensitive to the strength of the\nfeedback.\n", "  We calculate persistent current of one-dimensional rings of fermions\nneglecting the spin degrees of freedom considering only nearest-neighbor\nCoulomb interactions with different electron fillings in both ordered and\ndisordered cases. We treat the interaction exactly and find eigenenergies by\nexact diagonalization of many-body Hamiltonian and compute persistent current\nby numerical derivative method. We also determine Drude weight to estimate the\nconducting nature of the system. From our numerical results, we obtain a\nmetal-insulator transition in half-filled case with increasing correlation\nstrength U but away from half-filling no such transition is observed even for\nlarge U.\n", "  We present a comprehensive chemical abundance analysis of five red giants and\ntwo horizontal branch (HB) stars towards the southern Galactic bulge, at\n(l,b)$\\sim$(0$^{\\rm o}$,-11$^{\\rm o}$). Based on high-resolution spectroscopy\nobtained with the Magellan/MIKE spectrograph, we derived up to 23 chemical\nelement abundances and identify a mixed bag of stars, representing various\npopulations in the central regions of the Galaxy. Although cosmological\nsimulations predict that the inner Galaxy was host to the first stars in the\nUniverse, we see no chemical evidence of the ensuing massive supernova\nexplosions: all of our targets exhibit halo-like, solar [Sc/Fe] ratios, which\nis in contrast to the low values predicted from Population III nucleosynthesis.\nOne of the targets is a CEMP-s star at [Fe/H]=-2.52 dex, and another one is a\nmoderately metal-poor ([Fe/H]=-1.53 dex) CH star with strong enrichment in\ns-process elements (e.g., [Ba/Fe]=1.35). These individuals provide the first\ncontenders of these classes of stars towards the bulge. Four of the\ncarbon-normal stars exhibit abundance patterns reminiscent of halo star across\na metallicity range spanning -2.0 to -2.6 dex, i.e., enhanced $\\alpha$-elements\nand solar Fe-peak and n-capture elements, and the remaining one is a regular\nmetal-rich bulge giant. The position, distance, and radial velocity of one of\nthe metal-poor HB stars coincides with the old trailing arm of the disrupted\nSagittarius dwarf galaxy. While their uncertain proper motions prohibit a clear\nkinematic separation, the stars' abundances and distances suggest that these\nmetal-poor candidates, albeit located towards the bulge, are not of the bulge,\nbut rather inner halo stars on orbits that make them pass through the central\nregions. Thus, we caution similar claims of detections of metal-poor stars as\ntrue habitants of the bulge. (Abridged)\n", "  Newly born and young radio sources are in a delicate phase of their life.\nTheir jets are fighting their way through the surrounding gaseous medium,\nstrongly experiencing this interaction while, at the same time, impacting and\naffecting the interstellar medium (ISM). Here we present the results from two\nstudies of HI (in absorption) and molecular gas illustrating what can be\nlearned from these phases of the gas. We first describe a statistical study\nwith the WSRT. The study shows that the young radio sources not only have an\nhigher detection rate of HI, but also systematically broader and more\nasymmetric HI profiles, most of them blueshifted. This supports the idea that\nwe are looking at young radio jets making their way through the surrounding\nISM, which also appears to be, on average, richer in gas than in evolved radio\nsources. Signatures of the impact of the jet are seen in the kinematics of the\ngas. However, even among the young sources, we identify a population that\nremains undetected in HI even after stacking their profiles. Orientation\neffects can only partly explain the result. These objects either are genuinely\ngas-poor or have different conditions of the medium, e.g. higher spin\ntemperature. We further present the ALMA study of molecular gas in IC5063 to\ntrace in detail the jet impacting the ISM. The kinematics of the cold,\nmolecular gas co-spatial with the radio plasma shows this process in action.\nThe ALMA data reveal a fast outflow of molecular gas extending along the entire\nradio jet (~1 kpc), with the highest outflow velocities at the location of the\nbrighter hot-spot. We propose a scenario where the radio jet is expanding into\na clumpy medium, interacting directly with the clouds and inflating a cocoon\nthat drives a lateral outflow into the ISM.\n", "  <Context.> Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) at the dynamical center of galaxies\nappear to have a complex star formation history. This suggests repeated star\nformation even in the influence of the strong tidal field from supermassive\nblack holes. <Aim.> In our previous study, we have detected 31 so far unknown\nearly-type star candidates throughout the Galactic NSC (at 0.5 - 3 pc from Sgr\nA*; Nishiyama and Schoedel 2013). The aim of this study is a confirmation of\nthe spectral type for the candidates. <Method.> We have carried out NIR\nspectroscopic observations of the candidates using Subaru/IRCS/AO188/LGS.\nK-band spectra for 20 out of the 31 candidates were obtained. By determining an\nequivalent width, EW(CO), of the 12CO absorption feature at 2.294 um, we have\nderived an effective temperature and a bolometric magnitude for each candidate,\nand then constructed an HR diagram. <Results.> No young (~ Myr), massive stars\nare included in the 20 candidates we observed; however, 13 candidates are most\nlikely intermediate-age giants (50 - 500 Myr). Two other sources have ages of\n~1 Gyr, and the remaining five sources are old (> 1 Gyr), late-type giants.\n<Conclusions.> Although none of the early-type star candidates from our\nprevious narrow-band imaging observations can be confirmed as a young star, we\nfind that the photometric technique is sensitive to distinguish old, late-type\ngiants from young and intermediate-age populations. The intermediate-age stars\ncould be so far unknown members of a population formed in a starburst ~100 Myr\nago. Finding no young (~ a few Myr) stars at R = 0.5 - 3 pc favors the in-situ\nformation scenario for the presence of the young stars at R < 0.5 pc.\nFurthermore, the different spatial distributions of the young and the\nintermediate-age stars imply that the Galactic NSC is an aggregate of stars\nborn in different places and under different physical conditions.\n", "  Our knowledge of main-belt comets (MBCs), which exhibit comet-like activity\nlikely due to the sublimation of volatile ices, yet orbit in the main asteroid\nbelt, has increased greatly since the discovery of the first known MBC,\n133P/Elst-Pizarro, in 1996, and their recognition as a new class of solar\nsystem objects after the discovery of two more MBCs in 2005. I review work that\nhas been done over the last 10 years to improve our understanding of these\nenigmatic objects, including the development of systematic discovery methods\nand diagnostics for distinguishing MBCs from disrupted asteroids (which exhibit\ncomet-like activity due to physical disruptions such as impacts or rotational\ndestabilization). I also discuss efforts to understand the dynamical and\nthermal properties of these objects.\n", "  The TDCB test is an established method to determine the critical strain\nenergy release rate of adhesives in mode I. Provided that the adherends stay\nelastic, that the adhesive layer is not too flexible and that inertia effects\ncan be neglected, the experiment allows to identify the work required by the\nadhesive layer per area of crack growth. The evaluation according to the\nstandard does not permit to distinguish between different sources of\ndissipation in the adhesive layer or at the adhesive-adherend interfaces,\nthough. This paper proposes two approaches to gain a more detailed\nunderstanding of the dissipation in mode I crack growth of adhesive layers.\n  The first investigation method uses detailed finite element simulations of\nthe TDCB test based on an elastic-plastic adhesive material model derived from\ntests on bulk specimens. The simulation is used to distinct between the work\nrequired for the plastic deformation of the entire adhesive layer and the work\nconsumed by the crack and the adhesive in its vicinity. The dependence of this\ndistribution of work on the adhesive layer thickness is studied. The second\napproach adds a temperature measurement by an infrared camera to the TDCB test.\nThis measurement allows observation of the thermo-elastic effect in the\nadhesive layer and of the heat generation at the crack. Finally, the results of\nthe two approaches are employed to estimate the energy balance in the TDCB\ntest.\n", "  Interactions between a protein and a ligand are often accompanied by a\nredistribution of the population of thermally accessible conformations. This\ndynamic response of the protein's functional energy landscape enables a protein\nto modulate binding affinities and control binding sensitivity to ligand\nconcentration. In this paper, we investigate the structural origins of binding\naffinity and allosteric cooperativity of binding two calcium ions to each\ndomain of calmodulin (CaM) through simulations of a simple coarse-grained\nmodel. In this model, the protein's conformational transitions between open and\nclosed conformational ensembles are simulated explicitly and ligand binding and\nunbinding is treated implicitly within the Grand Canonical Ensemble. Ligand\nbinding is cooperative because the binding sites are coupled through a shift in\nthe dominant conformational ensemble upon binding. The classic\nMonod-Wyman-Changeux model of allostery with appropriate binding free energy to\nthe open and closed ensembles accurately describes the simulated binding\nthermodynamics. The simulations predict that the two domains of CaM have\ndistinct binding affinity and cooperativity. In particular, C-terminal domain\nbinds calcium with higher affinity and greater cooperativity than the\nN-terminal domain. From a structural point of view, the affinity of an\nindividual binding loop depends sensitively on the loop's structural\ncompatibility with the ligand in the bound ensemble, as well as the\nconformational flexibility of the binding site in the unbound ensemble.\n", "  Analogues of the frequentist chi-square and F tests are proposed for testing\ngoodness-of-fit and consistency for Bayesian models. Simple examples exhibit\nthese tests' detection of inconsistency between consecutive experiments with\nidentical parameters, when the first experiment provides the prior for the\nsecond. In a related analysis, a quantitative measure is derived for judging\nthe degree of tension between two different experiments with partially\noverlapping parameter vectors.\n", "  It is well known that random multiplicative processes generate power-law\nprobability distributions. We study how the spatio-temporal correlation of the\nmultipliers influences the power-law exponent. We investigate two sources of\nthe time correlation: the local environment and the global environment. In\naddition, we introduce two simple models through which we analytically and\nnumerically show that the local and global environments yield different trends\nin the power-law exponent.\n", "  We construct global semi-realistic supersymmetric models with intersecting\nD6-branes on the non-factorisable orientifold\n$T^6/(\\mathbb{Z}_4\\times\\Omega\\mathcal{R})$. The non-factorisable structure\ngives rise to differences compared to the factorisable case: additional\nconditions for the three-cycles to be Lagrangian and extra constraints on the\nwrapping numbers for building fractional cycles.\n", "  We investigate shell emission associated with dying radio loud AGNs. First,\nbased on our recent work by Ito et al. (2015), we describe the dynamical and\nspectral evolutions of shells after stopping the jet energy injection. We find\nthat the shell emission overwhelms that of the radio lobes soon after stopping\nthe jet energy injection because fresh electrons are continuously supplied into\nthe shell via the forward shock while the radio lobes rapidly fade out without\njet energy injection. We find that such fossil shells can be a new class of\ntarget sources for SKA telescope. Next, we apply the model to the nearby radio\nsource 3C84. Then, we find that the fossil shell emission in 3C84 is less\nluminous in radio band while it is bright in TeV gamma-ray band and it can be\ndetectable by CTA.\n", "  The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will be a ground-based, optical,\nall-sky, rapid cadence survey project with tremendous potential for discovering\nand characterizing asteroids. With LSST's large 6.5m diameter primary mirror, a\nwide 9.6 square degree field of view 3.2 Gigapixel camera, and rapid\nobservational cadence, LSST will discover more than 5 million asteroids over\nits ten year survey lifetime. With a single visit limiting magnitude of 24.5 in\nr-band, LSST will be able to detect asteroids in the Main Belt down to\nsub-kilometer sizes. The current strawman for the LSST survey strategy is to\nobtain two visits (each visit being a pair of back-to-back 15s exposures) per\nfield, separated by about 30 minutes, covering the entire visible sky every 3-4\ndays throughout the observing season, for ten years.\n  The catalogs generated by LSST will increase the known number of small bodies\nin the Solar System by a factor of 10-100 times, among all populations. The\nmedian number of observations for Main Belt asteroids will be on the order of\n200-300, with Near Earth Objects receiving a median of 90 observations. These\nobservations will be spread among ugrizy bandpasses, providing photometric\ncolors and allowing sparse lightcurve inversion to determine rotation periods,\nspin axes, and shape information.\n  These catalogs will be created using automated detection software, the LSST\nMoving Object Processing System (MOPS), that will take advantage of the\ncarefully characterized LSST optical system, cosmetically clean camera, and\nrecent improvements in difference imaging. Tests with the prototype MOPS\nsoftware indicate that linking detections (and thus discovery) will be possible\nat LSST depths with our working model for the survey strategy, but evaluation\nof MOPS and improvements in the survey strategy will continue. All data\nproducts and software created by LSST will be publicly available.\n", "  The semi-regular variable star RU Vulpeculae (RU Vul) is being observed\nvisually since 1935. Its pulsation period and amplitude are declining since\n$\\sim1954$. A leading hypothesis to explain the period decrease in asymptotic\ngiant branch (AGB) stars such as RU Vul is an ongoing flash of the He-burning\nshell, also called a thermal pulse (TP), inside the star. In this paper, we\npresent a CCD photometric light curve of RU Vul, derive its fundamental\nparameters, and test if the TP hypothesis can describe the observed period\ndecline. We use CCD photometry to determine the present-day pulsation period\nand amplitude in three photometric bands, and high-resolution optical\nspectroscopy to derive the fundamental parameters. The period evolution of RU\nVul is compared to predictions by evolutionary models of the AGB phase. We find\nthat RU Vul is a metal-poor star with a metallicity $[{\\rm M}/{\\rm\nH}]=-1.59\\pm0.05$ and an effective surface temperature of $T_{\\rm\neff}=3634\\pm20$ K. The low metallicity of RU Vul and its kinematics indicate\nthat it is an old, low-mass member of the thick disc or the halo population.\nThe present day pulsation period determined from our photometry is $\\sim108$ d,\nthe semi-amplitude in the V-band is $0.39\\pm0.03$ mag. The observed period\ndecline is found to be well matched by an evolutionary AGB model with stellar\nparameters comparable to those of RU Vul. We conclude that the TP hypothesis is\nin good agreement with the observed period evolution of RU Vul.\n", "  We present H$\\alpha$ gas kinematics for 178 star-forming galaxies at z~2 from\nthe MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field survey. We have developed models to interpret\nthe kinematic measurements from fixed-angle multi-object spectroscopy, using\nstructural parameters derived from CANDELS HST/F160W imaging. For 35 galaxies\nwe measure resolved rotation with a median $(V/\\sigma_{V,0})_{R_E}=2.1$. We\nderive dynamical masses from the kinematics and sizes and compare them to\nbaryonic masses, with gas masses estimated from dust-corrected H$\\alpha$ star\nformation rates (SFRs) and the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. When assuming that\ngalaxies with and without observed rotation have the same median\n$(V/\\sigma_{V,0})_{R_E}$, we find good agreement between the dynamical and\nbaryonic masses, with a scatter of $\\sigma_{RMS}=0.34$dex and a median offset\nof $\\Delta\\log_{10}M=0.04$dex. This comparison implies a low dark matter\nfraction (8% within an effective radius) for a Chabrier initial mass function\n(IMF), and disfavors a Salpeter IMF. Moreover, the requirement that\n$M_{dyn}/M_{baryon}$ should be independent of inclination yields a median value\nof $(V/\\sigma_{V,0})_{R_E}=2.1$ for galaxies without observed rotation. If\ninstead we treat the galaxies without detected rotation as early-type galaxies,\nthe masses are also in reasonable agreement ($\\Delta\\log_{10}M=-0.07$dex,\n$\\sigma_{RMS}=0.37$dex). The inclusion of gas masses is critical in this\ncomparison; if gas masses are excluded there is an increasing trend of\n$M_{dyn}/M_{*}$ with higher specific SFR (SSFR). Furthermore, we find\nindications that $V/\\sigma$ decreases with increasing H$\\alpha$ SSFR for our\nfull sample, which may reflect disk settling. We also study the Tully-Fisher\nrelation and find that at fixed stellar mass\n$S_{0.5}=(0.5V_{2.2}^2+\\sigma_{V,0}^2)^{1/2}$ was higher at earlier times. At\nfixed baryonic mass, we observe the opposite trend. [abridged]\n", "  We review the stabilisation of complex structure moduli in Type IIA\norientifolds, especially on $T^6 / (\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_6^\\prime\n\\times \\Omega \\mathcal{R})$ with discrete torsion, via deformations of\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold singularities. While D6-branes in\nSO(2N) and USp(2N) models always preserve supersymmetry and thus give rise to\nflat directions, in an exemplary Pati-Salam model with only U(N) gauge groups\nten out of the 15 deformation moduli can be stabilised at the orbifold point.\n", "  The discovery of double-peaked light curves in some superluminous supernovae\noffers an important new clue to their origins. We examine the published\nphotometry of all Type Ic SLSNe, finding 14 objects with constraining data or\nlimits around the time of explosion. Of these, 8 (including the already\nidentified SN 2006oz and LSQ14bdq) show plausible flux excess at the earliest\nepochs, which deviate significantly (2-9$\\sigma$) from polynomial fits to the\nrising light curves. Simple scaling of the LSQ14bdq data show that they are all\nconsistent with a similar double-peaked structure. PS1-10pm provides\nmulticolour UV data indicating a temperature of $T_{\\rm bb}=25000\\pm5000\\,$K\nduring the early `bump' phase. We find that a double-peak cannot be excluded in\nany of the other 6 objects, and that this behaviour may be ubiquitous. The\nhomogeneity of the observed bumps is unexpected for interaction-powered models.\nEngine-powered models can explain the observations if all progenitors have\nextended radii or the central engine drives shock breakout emission several\ndays after the supernova explosion.\n", "  In this study we show from first principles calculations the possibility to\ninduce multiferroic and magnetoelectric functional properties in the Pnma\nNaMnF3 fluoroperovskite by means of epitaxial strain engineering. Surprisingly,\nwe found a very strong non-linear polarization-strain coupling that drives an\natypical amplification of the ferroelectric polarization for either compression\nor expansion of the cell. This property is associated with a non-collinear\nantiferromagnetic ordering, which induces a weak ferromagnetism and thus,\nmaking the strained NaMnF3 fluoroperovskite multiferroic. We also calculate the\nmagnetoelectric response and we found it to be composed by linear and\nnon-linear components with amplitudes similar to the ones of Cr2O3. These\nproperties show that it is possible to move the fluoride family toward\nfunctional applications with unique responses.\n", "  We study deformations of plane curves in the similarity geometry. It is known\nthat continuous deformations of smooth curves are described by the Burgers\nhierarchy. In this paper, we formulate the discrete deformation of discrete\nplane curves described by the discrete Burgers hierarchy as isogonal\ndeformations. We also construct explicit formulas for the curve deformations by\nusing the solution of linear diffusion differential/difference equations.\n", "  We study analytically and with the numerical time-evolving block decimation\nmethod the dynamics of an impurity in a bath of spinless fermions with\nnearest-neighbor interactions in a one-dimensional lattice. The bath is in a\nMott insulator state with alternating sites occupied and the impurity interacts\nwith the bath by repulsive on-site interactions. We find that when the\nmagnitudes of the on-site and nearest-neighbor interactions are close to each\nother, the system shows excitations of two qualitatively distinct types. For\nthe first type, a domain wall and an anti-domain wall of density propagate in\nopposite directions, while the impurity stays at the initial position. For the\nsecond one, the impurity is bound to the anti-domain wall while the domain wall\npropagates, an excitation where the impurity and bath are closely coupled.\n", "  Relic gravitational waves (RGWs) , a background originated during inflation,\nwould give imprints on the pulsar timing residuals. This makes RGWs be one of\nimportant sources for detection using the method of pulsar timing. In this\npaper, we discuss the effects of RGWs on the single pulsar timing, and give\nquantitively the timing residuals caused by RGWs with different model\nparameters. In principle, if the RGWs are strong enough today, they can be\ndetected by timing a single millisecond pulsar with high precision after the\nintrinsic red noise in pulsar timing residuals were understood, even though\nobserving simultaneously multiple millisecond pulsars is a more powerful\ntechnique in extracting gravitational wave signals. We corrected the\nnormalization of RGWs using observations of the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB), which leads to the amplitudes of RGWs being reduced by two orders of\nmagnitude or so compared to our previous works. We made new constraints on RGWs\nusing the recent observations from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array, employing\nthe tensor-to-scalar ratio $r=0.2$ due to the tensor-type polarization\nobservations of CMB by BICEP2 as a referenced value even though it has been\ndenied. Moreover, the constraints on RGWs from CMB and BBN (Big Bang\nnucleosynthesis) will also be discussed for comparison.\n", "  Moessbauer transmission spectra for the 14.41-keV resonant line in 57Fe have\nbeen collected at room temperature by using 57Co(Rh) commercial source and\nalpha-Fe strain-free single crystal as an absorber. The absorber was magnetized\nto saturation in the absorber plane perpendicular to the gamma-ray beam axis\napplying small external magnetic field. Spectra were collected for various\norientations of the magnetizing field, the latter lying close to the [110]\ncrystal plane. A positive electric quadrupole coupling constant was found\npractically independent on the field orientation. One obtains the following\nvalue Vzz=+1.61(4)x10^19 V/m^2 for the (average) principal component of the\nelectric field gradient (EFG) tensor under assumption that the EFG tensor is\naxially symmetric and the principal axis is aligned with the magnetic hyperfine\nfield acting on the 57Fe nucleus. The nuclear spectroscopic electric quadrupole\nmoment for the first excited state of the 57Fe nucleus was adopted as +0.17 b.\nSimilar measurement was performed at room temperature using as-rolled\npolycrystalline alpha-Fe foil of high purity in the zero external field.\nCorresponding value for the principal component of the EFG was found as\nVzz=+1.92(4)x10^19 V/m^2. Hence, it seems that the origin of the EFG is\nprimarily due to the local (atomic) electronic wave function distortion caused\nby the spin-orbit interaction between effective electronic spin S and\nincompletely quenched electronic angular momentum L. It seems as well that the\nlowest order term proportional to the product L.LAMBDA.S dominates, as no\ndirection dependence of the EFG principal component is seen. The lowest order\nterm is isotropic for a cubic symmetry as one has LAMBDA=lambda.1 for cubic\nsystems with the symbol 1 denoting unit operator and lambda being the coupling\nparameter.\n", "  Boulders, rocks and regolith on fast rotating asteroids (<2.5 hours) are\nmodeled to slide towards the equator due to a strong centrifugal force and a\nlow cohesion force. As a result, regions of fresh subsurface material can be\nexposed. Therefore, we searched for color variation on small and fast rotating\nasteroids. We describe a novel technique in which the asteroid is\nsimultaneously observed in the visible and near-IR wavelength range. In this\ntechnique, brightness changes due to atmospheric extinction effects can be\ncalibrated across the visible and near-IR images. We use V- and J-band filters\nsince the distinction in color between weathered and unweathered surfaces on\nordinary chondrite-like bodies is most prominent at these wavelengths and can\nreach ~25%. To test our method, we observed 3 asteroids with Cerro Tololo's 1.3\nm telescope. We find ~5% variation of the mean V-J color, but do not find any\nclearly repeating color signature through multiple rotations. This suggests\nthat no landslides occurred within the timescale of space weathering, or that\nLandslides occurred but the exposed patches are too small for the measurements'\nuncertainty.\n", "  We carry out direct numerical simulations of turbulent astrophysical media\nexposed to the redshift zero metagalactic background. The simulations assume\nsolar composition and explicitly track ionizations, recombinations, and\nion-by-ion radiative cooling for hydrogen, helium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,\nneon, sodium, magnesium, silicon, sulfur, calcium, and iron. Each run reaches a\nglobal steady state that not only depends on the ionization parameter, $U,$ and\nmass-weighted average temperature, $T_{\\rm MW},$ but also on the the\none-dimensional turbulent velocity dispersion, \\soned. We carry out runs that\nspan a grid of models with $U$ ranging from 0 to 10$^{-1}$ and \\soned\\ ranging\nfrom 3.5 to 58 km s$^{-1}$, and we vary the product of the mean density and the\ndriving scale of the turbulence, $nL,$ which determines the average temperature\nof the medium, from $nL =10^{16}$ to $nL =10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$. The turbulent\nMach numbers of our simulations vary from $M \\approx 0.5$ for the lowest\nvelocity dispersions cases to $M \\approx 20$ for the largest velocity\ndispersion cases. When $M \\lesssim1,$ turbulent effects are minimal, and the\nspecies abundances are reasonably described as those of a uniform photoionized\nmedium at a fixed temperature. On the other hand, when $M \\gtrsim 1,$ dynamical\nsimulations such as the ones carried out here are required to accurately\npredict the species abundances. We gather our results into a set of tables, to\nallow future redshift zero studies of the intergalactic medium to account for\nturbulent effects.\n", "  We use the elimination theory to explicitly construct the (n-3)! order\npolynomial in one of the variables of the scattering equations. The answer can\nbe given either in terms of a determinant of Sylvester type of dimension (n-3)!\nor a determinant of B\\'ezout type of dimension (n-4)!. We present a recursive\nformula for the Sylvester determinant. Expansion of the determinants yields\nexpressions in terms of Pl\\\"ucker coordinates. Elimination of the rest of the\nvariables of the scattering equations is also presented.\n", "  Wei et al [PRD 88, 043510 (2013)] have proposed the existence of a\ncosmological degeneracy between warm dark matter (WDM), modified gravity and\ncoupled cold dark matter (CDM) cosmologies at both the background expansion and\nthe growth of density perturbation levels, i.e., corresponding cosmological\ndata would not be able to differentiate such scenarios. Here, we will focus on\nthe specific indistinguishability between a warm dark matter plus cosmological\nconstant ($\\Lambda$) and coupled scalar field-CDM scenarios. Although the\nstatement of Wei et al is true for very specific conditions we present a more\ncomplete discussion on this issue and show in more detail that these models are\nindeed distinguishable. We show that the degeneracy breaks down since coupled\nmodels leave a specific signature in the redshift space distortion data which\nis absent in the uncoupled warm dark matter cosmologies. Furthermore, we\ncomplement our claim by providing the reasons which suggest that even at\nnonlinear level a breaking of such apparent equivalence is also expected.\n", "  We present results from spectroscopic observations with the Michigan/Magellan\nFiber System (M2FS) of $147$ stellar targets along the line of sight to the\nnewly-discovered `ultrafaint' stellar systems Tucana 2 (Tuc 2) and Grus 1 (Gru\n1). Based on simultaneous estimates of line-of-sight velocity and\nstellar-atmospheric parameters, we identify 8 and 7 stars as probable members\nof Tuc 2 and and Gru 1, respectively. Our sample for Tuc 2 is sufficient to\nresolve an internal velocity dispersion of $8.6_{-2.7}^{+4.4}$ km s$^{-1}$\nabout a mean of $-129.1_{-3.5}^{+3.5}$ km s$^{-1}$ (solar rest frame), and to\nestimate a mean metallicity of [Fe/H]= $-2.23_{-0.12}^{+0.18}$. These results\nplace Tuc 2 on chemodynamical scaling relations followed by dwarf galaxies,\nsuggesting a dominant dark matter component with dynamical mass\n$2.7_{-1.3}^{+3.1}\\times 10^6$ $\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ enclosed within the central\n$\\sim 160$ pc, and dynamical mass-to-light ratio $1900_{-900}^{+2200}$\n$\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}/L_{V,\\odot}$. For Gru 1 we estimate a mean velocity of\n$-140.5_{-1.6}^{+2.4}$ km s$^{-1}$ and a mean metallicity of\n[Fe/H]=$-1.42_{-0.42}^{+0.55}$, but our sample does not resolve Gru 1's\nvelocity dispersion. The radial coordinates of Tuc 2 and Gru 1 in Galactic\nphase space suggest that their orbits are among the most energetic within\ndistance $\\leq 300$ kpc. Moreover, their proximity to each other in this space\narises naturally if both objects are trailing the Large Magellanic Cloud.\n", "  Optical forces acting on nano-sized particles are typically too small to be\nuseful for particle manipulation. We theoretically and numerically demonstrate\na mechanism that can significantly enhance the optical force acting on a small\nparticle through a special type of resonant particle-substrate coupling. The\nresonance arises from the singular behavior of the particle's effective\npolarizablity in the presence of a metal-dielectric-metal multilayer substrate.\nWe show that this phenomenon is closely related to the existence of a flat-band\nplasmon mode supported by the multilayer substrate.\n", "  We discuss a new type of L=0 positive-parity dibaryons, pion-B-B', where the\ndominant binding mechanism is provided by resonating p-wave pion-baryon\ninteractions. Recent calculations of such pion assisted dibaryons are reviewed\nwith special emphasis placed on the non-strange I(JP)=1(2+) N-Delta dibaryon\nD_{12}(2150) studied recently at JLab, and on the 0(3+) Delta-Delta dibaryon\nD_{03}(2380) discovered recently by the WASA-at-COSY Collaboration. We review\nrecent searches by the HADES Collaboration at GSI and by the E15 and E27\nExperiments at J-PARC for a strangeness S=-1 I(JP)=1/2(0-) K-pp dibaryon and\nperhaps also for a strange I(JP)=3/2(2+) N-Sigma(1385) pion assisted dibaryon\nY_{3/2(2+)}(2270). Charm C=+1 dibaryons, predicted with these same I(JP)\nvalues, are also briefly reviewed.\n", "  Weakly ionized protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are subject to\nnon-ideal-magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects including Ohmic resistivity, the\nHall effect and ambipolar diffusion (AD), and the resulting magnetic\ndiffusivities ($\\eta_O, \\eta_H$ and $\\eta_A$) largely control the disk gas\ndynamics. The presence of grains not only strongly reduces disk ionization\nfraction, but also modify the scalings of $\\eta_H$ and $\\eta_A$ with magnetic\nfield strength. We derive analytically asymptotic expressions of $\\eta_H$ and\n$\\eta_A$ in both strong and weak field limits and show that towards strong\nfield, $\\eta_H$ can change sign (at a threshold field strength $B_{\\rm th}$),\nmimicking a flip of field polarity, and AD is substantially reduced. Applying\nto PPDs, we find that when small $\\sim0.1$ ($0.01$)$\\mu$m grains are\nsufficiently abundant [mass ratio $\\sim0.01$ ($10^{-4}$)], $\\eta_H$ can change\nsign up to $\\sim2-3$ scale heights above midplane at modest field strength\n(plasma $\\beta\\sim100$) over a wide range of disk radii. Reduction of AD is\nalso substantial towards the AD dominated outer disk and may activate the\nmagneto-rotational instability. We further perform local non-ideal MHD\nsimulations of the inner disk (within 10 AU) and show that with sufficiently\nabundant small grains, magnetic field amplification due to the Hall-shear\ninstability saturates at very low level near the threshold field strength\n$B_{\\rm th}$. Together with previous studies, we conclude by discussing the\ngrain-abundance-dependent phenomenology of PPD gas dynamics.\n", "  The Kepler planetary system consists of two exoplanets at similar separations\n(0.115 & 0.128 AU), which have dramatically different densities. The inner\nplanet has a density consistent with an Earth-like composition, while the outer\nplanet is extremely low-density, such that it must contain a voluminous H/He\nenvelope. Such a density difference would pose a problem for any formation\nmechanism if their current densities were representative of their composition\nat formation. However, both planets are at close enough separations to have\nundergone significant evaporation in the past. We constrain the core-mass, core\ncomposition, initial envelope-mass, and initial cooling-time of each planet\nusing evaporation models conditioned on their present-day masses and radii, as\ninferred from Kepler photometry and transit timing analysis. The inner planet\nis consistent with being an evaporatively stripped core, while the outer planet\nhas retained some of its initial envelope due to its higher core-mass.\nTherefore, both planets could have had a similar formation pathway, with the\ninner planet having an initial envelope-mass fraction of $\\lesssim 10\\%$ and\ncore-mass of $\\sim4.4$ M$_\\oplus$, while the outer had an initial envelope-mass\nfraction of order 15-30\\% and core-mass $\\sim7.3$ M$_\\oplus$. Finally, our\nresults indicate that the outer planet had a long ($\\gtrsim30$ Myr) initial\ncooling-time, much longer than would naively be predicted from simple timescale\narguments. The long initial cooling-time could be evidence for a dramatic early\ncooling episode such as the recently proposed \"boil-off\" process.\n", "  We experimentally investigate the current-induced magnetization reversal in\nPt/[Co/Ni]$_3$/Al multilayers combining the anomalous Hall effect and\nmagneto-optical Kerr effect techniques in crossbar geometry. The magnetization\nreversal occurs through nucleation and propagation of a domain of opposite\npolarity for a current density of the order of 0.3 TA/m$^2$. In these\nexperiments we demonstrate a full control of each stage: i)the {\\O}rsted field\ncontrols the domain nucleation and ii) domain-wall propagation occurs by spin\ntorque from the Pt spin Hall effect. This scenario requires an in-plane\nmagnetic field to tune the domain wall center orientation along the current for\nefficient domain wall propagation. Indeed, as nucleated, domain walls are\nchiral and N\\'eel like due to the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction.\n", "  A comprehensive characterization of the detection efficiency of nine of the\nmajor asteroid surveys that have been active over the past two decades is\npresented. The detection efficiency is estimated on a nightly basis by\ncomparing the detected asteroids with the complete catalog of known asteroids\npropagated to the same observing epoch. Results include a nightly estimate of\nthe detection efficiency curves as a function of apparent magnitude and\napparent velocity of the asteroids, as well as a cumulative analysis to\nestimate the overall performance of each survey. The limiting magnitude\ndistribution is estimated for each survey, and it is then modeled as a function\nof telescope aperture to obtain an estimate over a wide range of apertures.\n", "  An almost non-abelian extension of the Rieffel deformation is presented in\nthis work. The non-abelicity comes into play by the introduction of unitary\ngroups which are dependent of the infinitesimal generators of $SU(n)$. This\nextension is applied to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory.\n", "  This paper presents a brief review and latest results of the work that has\nbeen carried out by the Planetary Science community in order to understand that\nrole of the geotechnical properties of granular asteroids (commonly known as\n\"rubble-pile\" asteroids) in their formation, evolution and possible disruption.\nAs such, we will touch in aspects of the theoretical and numerical tools that\nhave been used with this objective and how the obtained results compare to the\nobserved asteroids.\n", "  We use the holographic duality to study quantum quenches of a strongly\ncoupled CFT that drive the theory towards a non-relativistic fixed point with\nLifshitz scaling. We consider the case of a Lifshitz dynamical exponent $z$\nclose to unity, where the non-relativistic field theory can be understood as a\nspecific deformation of the corresponding CFT and, hence, the standard\nholographic dictionary can be applied. On the gravity side this amounts to\nfinding a dynamical bulk solution which interpolates between AdS and Lishitz\nspacetimes as time evolves. We show that an asymptotically Lifshitz black hole\nis always formed in the final state. This indicates that it is impossible to\nreach the vacuum state of the Lifshitz theory from the CFT vacuum as a result\nof the proposed quenching mechanism. The nonequilibrium dynamics following the\nbreaking of the relativistic scaling symmetry is also probed using both local\nand non-local observables. In particular, we conclude that the equilibration\nprocess happens in a top-down manner, i.e., the symmetry is broken faster for\nUV modes.\n", "  We use the directed networks between articles of 24 Wikipedia language\neditions for producing the Wikipedia Ranking of World Universities (WRWU) using\nPageRank, 2DRank and CheiRank algorithms. This approach allows to incorporate\nvarious cultural views on world universities using the mathematical statistical\nanalysis independent of cultural preferences. The Wikipedia ranking of top 100\nuniversities provides about 60 percent overlap with the Shanghai university\nranking demonstrating the reliable features of this approach. At the same time\nWRWU incorporates all knowledge accumulated at 24 Wikipedia editions giving\nstronger highlights for historically important universities leading to a\ndifferent estimation of efficiency of world countries in university education.\nThe historical development of university ranking is analyzed during ten\ncenturies of their history.\n", "  We investigate the clustering and dark matter halo mass for a sample of\n$\\sim$16,000 central galaxies selected from the SDSS/DR7 group catalog. We\nselect subsamples of central galaxies on three two-dimensional planes, each\nformed by stellar mass ($M_{\\star}$) and one of the other properties including\noptical color (g-r) , surface stellar mass density ($\\mu_{\\star}$) and central\nstellar velocity dispersion ($\\sigma_{\\star}$). For each subsample we measure\nboth the projected cross-correlation function ($w_{p}(r_{p})$) relative to a\nreference galaxy sample, and an average mass of the host dark matter halos\n($M_{halo}$) . For comparison we have also estimated the $w_{p}(r_{p})$ for the\nfull galaxy population and the subset of satellite galaxies. We find that, for\ncentral galaxies, both $w_{p}(r_{p})$ and $M_{halo}$ show strongest dependence\non $M_{\\star}$, and there is no clear dependence on other properties when\nstellar mass is fixed. This result provides strong support to the\npreviously-adopted assumption that, for central galaxies, stellar mass is the\ngalaxy property that is best indicative of the host dark halo mass. The full\ngalaxy population and the subset of satellites show similar clustering\nproperties in all cases. However, they are similar to the centrals only at high\nmasses ($M_{\\star} \\geq 10^{11} M_{\\odot}$). At low-mass ($M_{\\star} \\leq\n10^{11} M_{\\odot}$), the results are different: the $w_{p}(r_{p})$ increases\nwith both $\\sigma$ and g-r when $M_{\\star}$ is fixed, and depends very weakly\non $M_{\\star}$ when $\\sigma_{\\star}$ or g-r is fixed. At fixed $M_{star}$, the\n$\\mu_{\\star}$ shows weak correlations with clustering amplitude (and halo mass\nfor central galaxies). Our results suggest that it is necessary to consider\ncentral and satellite galaxies separately when studying the link between\ngalaxies and dark matter halos. (Abridged)\n", "  Modal noise is a common source of noise introduced to the measurements by\noptical fibres and is particularly important for fibre-fed spectroscopic\ninstruments, especially for high-resolution measurements. This noise source can\nlimit the signal-to-noise ratio and jeopardize photon-noise limited data. The\nsubject of the present work is to compare measurements of modal noise and\nfocal-ratio degradation (FRD) for several commonly-used fibres. We study the\ninfluence of a simple mechanical scrambling method (excenter) on both FRD and\nmodal noise. Measurements are performed with circular and octagonal fibres from\nPolymicro Technology (FBP-Series) with diameters of 100, 200 and 300 {\\mu}m and\nfor square and rectangular fibres from CeramOptec, among others. FRD\nmeasurements for the same sample of fibres are performed as a function of\nwavelength. Furthermore, we replaced the circular fibre of the\nSTELLA-echelle-spectrograph (SES) in Tenerife with an octagonal and found a SNR\nincrease by a factor of 1.6 at 678 nm. It is shown in the laboratory that an\nexcenter with a large amplitude and low frequency will not influence the FRD\nbut will reduce modal noise rather effectively by up to 180%.\n", "  An extension of quasiclassical Keldysh-Usadel theory to higher spatial\ndimensions than one is crucial in order to describe physical phenomena like\ncharge/spin Hall effects and topological excitations like vortices and\nskyrmions, none of which are captured in one-dimensional models. We here\npresent a numerical finite element method which solves the non-linearized 2D\nand 3D quasiclassical Usadel equation relevant for the diffusive regime. We\nshow the application of this on three model systems with non-trivial\ngeometries: (i) a bottlenecked Josephson junction with external flux, (ii) a\nnanodisk ferromagnet deposited on top of a superconductor and (iii)\nsuperconducting islands in contact with a ferromagnet. In case (i), we\ndemonstrate that one may control externally not only the geometrical array in\nwhich superconducting vortices arrange themselves, but also to cause\ncoalescence and tune the number of vortices. In case (iii), we show that the\nsupercurrent path can be tailored by incorporating magnetic elements in planar\nJosephson junctions which also lead to a strong modulation of the density of\nstates. The finite element method presented herein paves the way for gaining\ninsight in physical phenomena which have remained largely unexplored due to the\ncomplexity of solving the full quasiclassical equations in higher dimensions.\n", "  We consider the effects of rotation and temperature on the structure of white\ndwarfs in order to compare them with the estimated data from observations.\n", "  Visibility scintillation resulting from wave propagation through the\nturbulent ionosphere can be an important sources of noise at low radio\nfrequencies ($\\nu\\lesssim 200$ MHz). Many low frequency experiments are\nunderway to detect the power spectrum of brightness temperature fluctuations of\nthe neutral-hydrogen $21$-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EOR:\n$12\\gtrsim z\\gtrsim 7$, $100\\lesssim \\nu \\lesssim 175$ MHz). In this paper, we\nderive scintillation noise power-spectra in such experiments while taking into\naccount the effects of typical data processing operations such as\nself-calibration and Fourier synthesis. We find that for minimally redundant\narrays such as LOFAR and MWA, scintillation noise is of the same order of\nmagnitude as thermal noise, has a spectral coherence dictated by stretching of\nthe snapshot $uv$-coverage with frequency, and thus is confined to the well\nknown wedge-like structure in the cylindrical ($2$-dimensional) power spectrum\nspace. Compact, fully redundant ($d_{\\rm core}\\lesssim r_{\\rm F} \\approx 300$ m\nat $150$ MHz) arrays such as HERA and SKA-LOW (core) will be scintillation\nnoise dominated at all baselines, but the spatial and frequency coherence of\nthis noise will allow it to be removed along with spectrally smooth\nforegrounds.\n", "  We study the role of light nuclear clusters in simulations of core-collapse\nsupernovae. Expressions for the reaction rates are developed for a large\nselection of charged current absorption and scattering processes with light\nclusters. Medium modifications are taken into account at the mean-field level.\nWe explore the possible impact on the supernova dynamics and the neutrino\nsignal during the mass accretion phase prior to the possible explosion onset as\nwell as during the subsequent protoneutron star deleptnoization after the\nexplosion onset has been launched.\n", "  Dynamics of small-amplitude perturbations in the global anti-de Sitter (AdS)\nspacetime is restricted by selection rules that forbid effective energy\ntransfer between certain sets of normal modes. The selection rules arise\nalgebraically because some integrals of products of AdS mode functions vanish.\nHere, we reveal the relation of these selection rules to AdS isometries. The\nformulation we discover through this systematic approach is both simpler and\nstronger than what has been reported previously. In addition to the selection\nrule considerations, we develop a number of useful representations for the\nglobal AdS mode functions, with connections to algebraic structures of the\nHiggs oscillator, a superintegrable system describing a particle on a sphere in\nan inverse cosine-squared potential, where the AdS isometries play the role of\na spectrum-generating algebra.\n", "  Production cross sections of nitrogen isotopes from high-energy carbon\nisotopes on hydrogen and carbon targets have been measured for the first time\nfor a wide range of isotopes. The fragment separator FRS at GSI was used to\ndeliver C isotope beams. The cross sections of the production of N isotopes\nwere determined by charge measurements of forward going fragments. The cross\nsections show a rapid increase with the number of neutrons in the projectile.\nSince the production of nitrogen is mostly due to charge exchange reactions\nbelow the proton separation energies, the present data suggests a concentration\nof Gamow-Teller and Fermi transition strength at low excitation energies for\nneutron-rich isotopes. It was also observed that the cross sections were\nenhanced much more strongly for neutron rich isotopes in the C-target data.\n", "  We present the results of a new series of global 3D relativistic\nmagneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of thin accretion disks around spinning\nblack holes. The disks have aspect ratios of $H/R\\sim 0.05$ and spin parameters\n$a/M=0, 0.5, 0.9$, and $0.99$. Using the ray-tracing code Pandurata, we\ngenerate broad-band thermal spectra and polarization signatures from the MHD\nsimulations. We find that the simulated spectra can be well fit with a simple,\nuniversal emissivity profile that better reproduces the behavior of the\nemission from the inner disk, compared to traditional analyses carried out\nusing a Novikov-Thorne thin disk model. Lastly, we show how spectropolarization\nobservations can be used to convincingly break the spin-inclination degeneracy\nwell-known to the continuum fitting method of measuring black hole spin.\n", "  Room temperature ionic liquids are attractive to numerous applications and\nparticularly, to renewable energy devices. As solvent free electrolytes, they\ndemonstrate a paramount connection between the material morphology and\nCoulombic interactions: unlike dilute electrolytes, the electrode/RTIL\ninterface is a product of both electrode polarization and spatiotemporal bulk\nproperties. Yet, theoretical studies have dealt almost exclusively with\nindependent models of morphology and electrokinetics. In this work, we develop\na novel Cahn-Hilliard-Poisson type mean-field framework that couples\nmorphological evolution with electrokinetic phenomena. Linear analysis of the\nmodel shows that spatially periodic patterns form via a finite wavenumber\ninstability, a property that cannot arise in the currently used\nFermi-Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations. Numerical simulations in above one-space\ndimension, demonstrate that while labyrinthine type patterns develop in the\nbulk, stripe patterns emerge near charged surfaces. The results qualitatively\nagree with empirical observations and thus, provide a physically consistent\nmethodology to incorporate phase separation properties into an electrochemical\nframework.\n", "  A comparative study is done of interdisciplinary citations in 2013 between\nphysics, chemistry, and molecular biology, in Brazil, South Korea, Turkey, and\nUSA. Several surprising conclusions emerge from our tabular and graphical\nanalysis: The cross-science citation rates are in general strikingly similar,\nbetween Brazil, South Korea, Turkey, and USA. One apparent exception is the\ncomparatively more tenuous relation between molecular biology and physics in\nBrazil and USA. Other slight exceptions are the higher amount of citing of\nphysicists by chemists in South Korea, of chemists by molecular biologists in\nTurkey, and of molecular biologists by chemists in Brazil and USA. Chemists\nare, by a sizable margin, the most cross-science citing scientists in this\ngroup of three sciences. Physicist are, again by a sizable margin, the least\ncross-science citing scientists in this group of three sciences. In all four\ncountries, the strongest cross-science citation is from chemistry to physics\nand the weakest cross-science citation is from physics to molecular biology.\nOur findings are consistent with a V-shaped backbone connectivity, as opposed\nto a Delta connectivity, as also found in a previous study of earlier citation\nyears.\n", "  We theoretically study dissociative ionization of H$_2^+$ exposed to strong\nlinearly polarized few-cycle visible, near-infrared and midinfrared laser\npulses. We find rich energy-sharing structures in the combined electron and\nnuclear kinetic energy spectra with features that are a priori at odds with\nsimple energy conservation arguments. We explain the structures as\ninterferences between wave packets released during different optical cycles,\nand during the same optical cycle, respectively. Both inter- and intracycle\ninterference structures are clearly visible in the joint energy spectra. The\nshapes of the interference structures depend on the dynamics leading to the\ndouble continuum, and carry sub-femtosecond information.\n", "  We summarize our studies on neutrino-driven nucleosynthesis in He shells of\nearly core-collapse supernovae with metallicities of $Z\\lesssim\n10^{-3}\\,Z_\\odot$. We find that for progenitors of $\\sim 11$--$15\\,{\\rm\nM}_\\odot$, the neutrons released by $^4{\\rm He}(\\bar{\\nu}_e,e^+n)^3{\\rm H}$ in\nHe shells can be captured to produce nuclei with mass numbers up to $A \\sim\n200$. This mechanism is sensitive to neutrino emission spectra and flavor\noscillations. In addition, we find two new primary mechanisms for\nneutrino-induced production of $^{9}$Be in He shells. The first mechanism\nproduces $^9$Be via $^7{\\rm Li}(n,\\gamma)^8{\\rm Li}(n,\\gamma)^9{\\rm\nLi}(e^-\\bar{\\nu}_e)^9{\\rm Be}$ and relies on a low explosion energy for its\nsurvival. The second mechanism operates in progenitors of $\\sim 8\\,{\\rm\nM}_\\odot$, where $^9$Be can be produced directly via $^7{\\rm Li}(^3{\\rm\nH},n_0)^9{\\rm Be}$ during the rapid expansion of the shocked He-shell material.\nThe light nuclei $^7$Li and $^3$H involved in these mechanisms are produced by\nneutrino interactions with $^4$He. We discuss the implications of\nneutrino-induced nucleosynthesis in He shells for interpreting the elemental\nabundances in metal-poor stars.\n", "  Bianchi-IX four metrics are $SU(2)$ invariant solutions of vacuum Einstein\nequation, for which the connection-wise self-dual case describes the Euler Top,\nwhile the curvature-wise self-dual case yields the Ricci flat classical\nDarboux-Halphen system. It is possible to see such a solution exhibiting Ricci\nflow. The classical Darboux-Halphen system is a special case of the generalized\none that arises from a reduction of the self-dual Yang-Mills equation and the\nsolutions to the related homogeneous quadratic differential equations provide\nthe desired metric. A few integrable and near-integrable dynamical systems\nrelated to the Darboux-Halphen system and occurring in the study of Bianchi IX\ngravitational instanton have been listed as well. We explore in details whether\nself-duality implies integrability.\n", "  Vacuum bubbles may nucleate and expand during the inflationary epoch in the\nearly universe. After inflation ends, the bubbles quickly dissipate their\nkinetic energy; they come to rest with respect to the Hubble flow and\neventually form black holes. The fate of the bubble itself depends on the\nresulting black hole mass. If the mass is smaller than a certain critical\nvalue, the bubble collapses to a singularity. Otherwise, the bubble interior\ninflates, forming a baby universe, which is connected to the exterior FRW\nregion by a wormhole. A similar black hole formation mechanism operates for\nspherical domain walls nucleating during inflation. As an illustrative example,\nwe studied the black hole mass spectrum in the domain wall scenario, assuming\nthat domain walls interact with matter only gravitationally. Our results\nindicate that, depending on the model parameters, black holes produced in this\nscenario can have significant astrophysical effects and can even serve as dark\nmatter or as seeds for supermassive black holes. The mechanism of black hole\nformation described in this paper is very generic and has important\nimplications for the global structure of the universe. Baby universes inside\nsuper-critical black holes inflate eternally and nucleate bubbles of all vacua\nallowed by the underlying particle physics. The resulting multiverse has a very\nnon-trivial spacetime structure, with a multitude of eternally inflating\nregions connected by wormholes. If a black hole population with the predicted\nmass spectrum is discovered, it could be regarded as evidence for inflation and\nfor the existence of a multiverse.\n", "  We are entering a new era of sensitive, large-area and multi-frequency radio\nsurveys that will allow us to identify Gigahertz-Peaked Spectrum (GPS) and\nCompact Steep Spectrum (CSS) radio sources over a wide range in radio\nluminosity and study them within the context of the overall radio-source\npopulations to which they belong. 'Classical' GPS/CSS objects are extremely\nluminous radio sources with a compact double morphology, commonly thought to\nrepresent the earliest stages in the life cycle of powerful radio galaxies\n(e.g. O'Dea 1998). It is now becoming easier to identify GPS/CSS candidates\nwith much lower radio luminosity - particularly in the nearby Universe. These\nless powerful objects, with typical 1.4 GHz radio luminosities of $10^{23}$ to\n$10^{25}$ W/Hz, include peaked-spectrum radio sources with a core-jet\nmorphology on parsec scales as well as high-frequency GPS-like peaked\ncomponents embedded within lower-frequency extended emission. In the latter\ncase, the presence of a young GPS component may not be evident from\nlow-frequency data alone. Many radio galaxies in the local Universe have a\ncompact (FR-0) morphology, and appear to lack extended radio emission on\nkiloparsec scales. The relationship of these FR-0 objects to the classical\nGPS/CSS radio sources remains unclear - some of them may represent short-lived\nepisodes of AGN activity that will not lead to an extended FR-1 or FR-2 radio\ngalaxy. Future wide-band radio surveys will shed more light on this - such\nsurveys should ideally be coordinated to cover the full frequency range from\n100 MHz to 100 GHz in order to sample all stages of GPS/CSS evolution in an\nunbiased way.\n", "  We report on the precision predictions for the $e^+e^-\\to ZZ\\gamma$ process\nincluding $Z$-boson leptonic decays at the ILC in the standard model (SM). The\ncalculation includes the full next-to-leading (NLO) electroweak (EW)\ncorrections and high order initial state radiation (h.o.ISR) contributions. We\nfind that the NLO EW corrections heavily suppress the LO cross section, and the\nh.o.ISR effects are notable near the threshold while become small in high\nenergy region. We present the LO and the NLO EW+h.o.ISR corrected distributions\nof the transverse momenta of final $Z$-boson and photon as well as the $Z$-pair\ninvariant mass, and investigate the corresponding NLO EW and h.o.ISR relative\ncorrections. We also study the leptonic decays of the final $Z$-boson pair by\nadopting the {\\sc MadSpin} method where the spin correlation effect is\ninvolved. We conclude that both the h.o.ISR effects and the NLO EW corrections\nare important in exploring the $ZZ\\gamma$ production at the ILC.\n", "  The origin of outflow in narrow-line region (NLR) of active galactic nucleus\n(AGN) is studied in this paper by focusing on the relationship between the\n[\\ion{O}{3}]$\\lambda$5007 line profile and the hard X-ray (in a bandpass of\n2-10 keV) emission from the central SMBH in type-I AGNs. A sample of 47 local\nX-ray selected type-I AGNs at $z<0.2$ is extracted from the 2XMMi/SDSS DR7\ncatalog that is originally crossmatched by Pineau et al. The X-ray luminosities\nin an energy band from 2 to 10keV of these luminous AGNs range from $10^{42}$\nto $10^{44}\\ \\mathrm{erg\\ s^{-1}}$. A joint spectral analysis is performed on\ntheir optical and X-ray spectra, in which the [\\ion{O}{3}] line profile is\nmodeled by a sum of several Gaussian functions to quantify its deviation from a\npure Gaussian function. The statistics allows us to identify a moderate\ncorrelation with a significance level of 2.78$\\sigma$: luminous AGNs with\nstronger [\\ion{O}{3}] blue asymmetry tend to have steeper hard X-ray spectra.\nBy identifying a role of $L/L_{\\mathrm{Edd}}$ on the correlation at a\n$2-3\\sigma$ significance level in both direct and indirect ways, we argue that\nthe photon index versus asymmetry correlation provides evidence that the AGN's\noutflow commonly observed in its NLR is related with the accretion process\noccurring around the central SMBH, which favors the wind/radiation model for\nthe origin of the outflow in luminous AGNs.\n", "  A small fraction($<10\\%$) of SDSS main sample galaxies(MGs) have not been\ntargeted with spectroscopy due to the the fiber collision effect. These\ngalaxies have been compiled into the input catalog of the LAMOST extra-galactic\nsurvey and named as the complementary galaxy sample. In this paper, we\nintroduce the project and the status of the spectroscopies of the complementary\ngalaxies in the first two years of the LAMOST spectral survey(till Sep. of\n2014). Moreover, we present a sample of 1,102 galaxy pairs identified from the\nLAMOST complementary galaxies and SDSS MGs, which are defined as that the two\nmembers have a projected distance smaller than 100 kpc and the recessional\nvelocity difference smaller than 500 $\\rm kms^{-1}$. Compared with the SDSS\nonly selected galaxy pairs, the LAMOST-SDSS pairs take the advantages of not\nbeing biased toward large separations and therefor play as a useful supplement\nto the statistical studies of galaxy interaction and galaxy merging.\n", "  We propose and perform a new test of the cosmic distance-duality relation\n(CDDR), $D_L(z) / D_A(z) (1 + z)^{2} = 1$, where $D_A$ is the angular diameter\ndistance and $D_L$ is the luminosity distance to a given source at redshift\n$z$, using strong gravitational lensing (SGL) and type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia)\ndata. We show that the ratio $D=D_{A_{12}}/D_{A_2}$ and\n$D^{*}=D_{L_{12}}/D_{L_{2}}$, where the subscripts 1 and 2 correspond,\nrespectively, to redshifts $z_1$ and $z_2$, are linked by $D/D^*=(1+z_1)^2$ if\nthe CDDR is valid. We allow departures from the CDDR by defining two funcions\nfor $\\eta(z_1)$, which equals unity when the CDDR is valid. We find that\ncombination of SGL and SNe Ia data favours no violation of the CDDR at\n1$\\sigma$ confidence level ($\\eta(z) \\simeq 1$), in complete agreement with\nother tests and reinforcing the theoretical pillars of the CDDR.\n", "  A search is conducted for new physics in multijet final states using 3.6\ninverse femtobarns of data from proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV\ntaken at the CERN Large Hadron Collider with the ATLAS detector. Events are\nselected containing at least three jets with scalar sum of jet transverse\nmomenta ($H_T$) greater than 1 TeV. No excess is seen at large $H_T$ and limits\nare presented on new physics: models which produce final states containing at\nleast three jets and having cross sections larger than 1.6 fb with $H_T$ > 5.8\nTeV are excluded. Limits are also given in terms of new physics models of\nstrong gravity that hypothesize additional space-time dimensions.\n", "  A sterile neutrino is a well-motivated and widely studied dark matter\ncandidate. The most straightforward realization of sterile neutrino dark\nmatter, through the Dodelson-Widrow mechanism, is now ruled out by a\ncombination of X-ray and Lyman-\\alpha measurements. An alternative production\nmechanism that is becoming increasingly popular in the literature is the\nfreeze-in mechanism, involving frameworks where a feeble coupling to a particle\n- usually a scalar beyond the Standard Model - in the thermal bath results in a\ngradual accumulation of the sterile neutrino dark matter abundance. This\narticle reviews the various motivations for realizing such frameworks in the\nliterature, their common characteristic features, and phenomenological\nsignatures.\n", "  We studied time variability and spectral evolution of the Galactic black hole\ntransient Swift J174510.8-262411 during the first phase of its outburst.\nINTEGRAL and Swift observations collected from 2012 September 16 until October\n30 have been used. The total squared fractional rms values did not drop below\n5% and QPOs, when present, were type-C, indicating that the source never made\nthe transition to the soft-intermediate state. Even though the source was very\nbright (up to 1 Crab in hard X-rays), it showed a so called failed outburst as\nit never reached the soft state. XRT and IBIS broad band spectra, well\nrepresented by a hybrid thermal/non-thermalComptonisationmodel, showed physical\nparameters characteristic of the hard and intermediate states. In particular,\nthe derived temperature of the geometrically thin disc black body was about 0.6\nkeV at maximum.We found a clear decline of the optical depth of the corona\nelectrons (close to values of 0.1), as well as of the total compactness ratio\nlh/ls. The hard-to-hard/intermediate state spectral transition is mainly driven\nby the increase in the soft photon flux in the corona, rather than small\nvariations of the electron heating. This, associated with the increasing of the\ndisc temperature, is consistent with a disc moving towards the compact object\nscenario, i.e. the truncated-disc model. Moreover, this scenario is consistent\nwith the decreasing fractional squared rms and increasing of the noise and QPO\nfrequency. In our final group of observations, we found that the contribution\nfrom the non-thermal Comptonisation to the total power supplied to the plasma\nis 0.59+0.02/-0.05 and that the thermal electrons cool to kTe<26 keV.\n", "  Emission from neutron stars and accretion disks in low-mass X-ray binaries is\nnot isotropic. The non-spherical shape of the disk as well as blocking of the\nneutron star by the disk and vice versa cause the observed flux to depend on\nthe inclination angle of the disk with respect to the line of sight. This is of\nspecial importance for the interpretation of Type I X-ray bursts, which are\npowered by the thermonuclear burning of matter accreted onto the neutron star.\nBecause part of the X-ray burst is reflected off the disk, the observed burst\nflux depends on the anisotropies for both direct emission from the neutron star\nand reflection off the disk. This influences measurements of source distance,\nmass accretion rate, and constraints on the neutron star equation of state.\nPrevious studies made predictions of the anisotropy factor for the total burst\nflux, assuming a geometrically flat disk. Recently, detailed observations of\ntwo exceptionally long bursts (so-called superbursts) allowed for the first\ntime for the direct and the reflected burst flux to each be measured, as\nopposed to just their sum. The ratio of the reflected and direct flux (the\nreflection fraction) was much higher than what the anisotropies of a flat disk\ncan account for. We create numerical models to calculate the anisotropy factors\nfor different disk shapes, including concave disks. We present the anisotropy\nfactors of the direct and reflected burst flux separately, as well as the\nanisotropy of the persistent flux. Reflection fractions substantially larger\nthan unity are produced in case the inner accretion disk steeply increases in\nheight, such that part of the star is blocked from view. Such a geometry could\npossibly be induced by the X-ray burst, if X-ray heating causes the inner disk\nto puff up.\n", "  We present an analysis of wide-field photometric surveys of the Palomar 5\nglobular cluster and its stellar stream, based on g- and r-band measures\ntogether with narrow-band DDO51 photometry. In this first study, we use the\ndeep (g,r) data to measure the incidence of gaps and peaks along the stream.\nExamining the star-counts profile of the stream plus contaminating populations,\nwe find no evidence for significant under-densities, and find only a single\nsignificant over-density. This is at odds with earlier studies based on\nmatched-filter maps derived from shallower SDSS data if the contaminating\npopulation possesses plausible spatial properties. The lack of substantial\nsub-structure along the stream may be used in future dynamical simulations to\nexamine the incidence of dark matter sub-halos in the Galactic halo. We also\npresent a measurement of the relative distances along the stream which we use\nto create the deepest wide-field map of this system to date.\n", "  The Lyman Continuum photon production efficiency ($\\xi_{\\rm ion}$) is a\ncritical ingredient for inferring the number of photons available to reionise\nthe intergalactic medium. To estimate the theoretical production efficiency in\nthe high-redshift Universe we couple the BlueTides cosmological hydrodynamical\nsimulation with a range of stellar population synthesis models. We find Lyman\nContinuum photon production efficiencies of $\\log_{10}(\\xi_{\\rm ion}/{\\rm\nerg^{-1}\\, Hz})\\approx 25.1-25.5$ depending on the choice of stellar population\nsynthesis model. These results are broadly consistent with recent observational\nconstraints at high-redshift though favour a model incorporating the effects of\nbinary evolution\n", "  Giant clumps are a characteristic feature of observed high-redshift disk\ngalaxies. We propose that these kpc-sized clumps have a complex substructure\nand are the result of many smaller clumps self-organizing themselves into clump\nclusters (CC). This bottom-up scenario is in contrast to the common top-down\nview that these giant clumps form first and then sub fragment. Using a high\nresolution hydrodynamical simulation of an isolated, fragmented massive gas\ndisk and mimicking the observations from Genzel et al. (2011) at $z \\sim 2$, we\nfind remarkable agreement in many details. The CCs appear as single entities of\nsizes $R_{\\mathrm{HWHM}} \\simeq 0.9-1.4$ kpc and masses $\\sim 1.5-3 \\times 10^9\n\\ \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ representative of high-z observations. They are organized\nin a ring around the center of the galaxy. The origin of the observed clumps'\nhigh intrinsic velocity dispersion $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{intrinsic}} \\simeq 50 - 100\n\\ \\mathrm{km \\ s^{-1}}$ is fully explained by the internal irregular motions of\ntheir substructure in our simulation. No additional energy input, e.g. via\nstellar feedback, is necessary. Furthermore, in agreement with observations, we\nfind a small velocity gradient $V_{\\mathrm{grad}} \\simeq 8 - 27 \\ \\mathrm{km \\\ns^{-1} \\ kpc^{-1}}$ along the CCs in the beam smeared velocity residual maps\nwhich corresponds to net prograde and retrograde rotation with respect to the\nrotation of the galactic disk. The CC scenario could have strong implications\nfor the internal evolution, lifetimes and the migration timescales of the\nobserved giant clumps, bulge growth and AGN activity, stellar feedback and the\nchemical enrichment history of galactic disks.\n", "  By means of N-body+Hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations we study the evolution of\nthe inner dark matter and stellar mass distributions of central dwarf galaxies\nformed in halos of virial masses Mv=2-3x10^10 Msun at z=0, both in a WDM and\nCDM cosmology. The half-mode mass in the WDM power spectrum of our simulations\nis Mf= 2x 10^10 Msun. In the dark matter only simulations halo density profiles\nare well described by the NFW parametric fit in both cosmologies, though the\nWDM halos have concentrations lower by factors 1.5--2.0 than their CDM\ncounterparts. In the hydrodynamic simulations, the effects of baryons\nsignificantly flatten the inner density, velocity dispersion, and pseudo\nphase-space density profiles of the WDM halos but not of the CDM ones. The\ndensity slope measured at ~ 0.02xRv, alpha, becomes shallow in periods of 2 to\n5 Gyr in the WDM runs. We explore whether this flattening process correlates\nwith the global SF, Ms/Mv ratio, gas outflow, and internal specific angular\nmomentum histories. We do not find any clear trends but when alpha is shallower\nthan -0.5, Ms/Mv is always between 0.25 and 1%. We conclude that the main\nreason of the formation of the shallow core is the presence of strong gas mass\nfluctuations inside the inner halo, which are a consequence of the feedback\ndriven by a very bursty and sustained SF history in shallow gravitational\npotentials. Our WDM halos, which assemble late and are less concentrated than\nthe CDM ones, obey these conditions. There are also (rare) CDM systems with\nextended mass assembly histories that obey these conditions and form indeed\nshallow cores. The dynamical heating and expansion processes, behind the DM\ncore flattening, apply also to the stars in a such a way that the stellar age\nand metallicity gradients of the dwarfs are softened, their stellar half-mass\nradii strongly grow with time, and their central surface densities decrease.\n", "  A detailed study of the $g$-factor anisotropy of electrons and holes in\nInAs/In$_{0.53}$Al$_{0.24}$Ga$_{0.23}$As self-assembled quantum dots emitting\nin the telecom spectral range of $1.5-1.6$ $\\mu$m (around 0.8 eV photon energy)\nis performed by time-resolved pump-probe ellipticity technique using a\nsuperconducting vector magnet. All components of the $g$-factor tensors are\nmeasured, including their spread in the quantum dot (QD) ensemble.\nSurprisingly, the electron $g$ factor shows a large anisotropy changing from\n$g_{\\mathrm{e},x}= -1.63$ to $g_{\\mathrm{e},z}= -2.52$ between directions\nperpendicular and parallel to the dot growth axis, respectively, at an energy\nof 0.82 eV. The hole $g$-factor anisotropy at this energy is even stronger:\n$|g_{\\text{h},x}|= 0.64$ and $|g_{\\text{h},z}|= 2.29$. On the other hand, the\nin-plane anisotropies of electron and hole $g$ factors are small. The\npronounced out-of-plane anisotropy is also observed for the spread of the $g$\nfactors, determined from the spin dephasing time. The hole longitudinal $g$\nfactors are described with a theoretical model that allows us to estimate the\nQD parameters. We find that the QD height-to-diameter ratio increases while the\nindium composition decreases with increasing QD emission energy.\n", "  Neutrino interactions with matter play an important role in determining the\nnucleosynthesis outcome in explosive astrophysical environments such as\ncore-collapse supernovae or mergers of compact objects. In this article, we\nfirst discuss our recent work on the importance of studying the time evolution\nof collective neutrino oscillations among active flavors in determining their\neffects on nucleosynthesis. We then consider the possible active-sterile\nneutrino mixing and demonstrate the need of a consistent approach to evolve\nneutrino flavor oscillations, matter composition, and the hydrodynamics when\nflavor oscillations can happen very deep inside the supernovae.\n", "  Serious theoretical effort has been devoted to explain the observed\nfrequencies of twin-peak quasi-periodic oscillations (HF QPOs) observed in\nlow-mass X-ray neutron star binaries. Here we propose a new model of HF QPOs.\nWithin its framework we consider an oscillating torus with cusp that changes\nlocation $r_0$ of its centre around radii very close to innermost stable\ncircular orbit. The observed variability is assigned to global modes of\naccreted fluid motion that may give strong modulation of both accretion disc\nradiation and the accretion rate. For a given spacetime geometry, the model\npredicts that QPO frequencies are function of single parameter $r_0$. We\nillustrate that the model can provide fits of data comparable to those reached\nby other models, or even better. In particular it is compared to relativistic\nprecession model. Moreover, we also illustrate that the model consideration is\ncompatible with consideration of models of a rotating neutron star in the atoll\nsource 4U~1636-53.\n", "  It is congruous with the quantum nature of the world to view the space-time\ngeometry as an emergent structure that shows classical features only at some\nobservational level. One can thus conceive the space-time manifold as a purely\ntheoretical arena, where quantum states are defined, with the additional\nfreedom of changing coordinates like any other symmetry. Observables, including\npositions and distances, should then be described by suitable operators acting\non such quantum states. In principle, the top-down (canonical) quantisation of\nEinstein-Hilbert gravity falls right into this picture, but is notoriously very\ninvolved. The complication stems from allowing all the classical canonical\nvariables that appear in the (presumably) fundamental action to become quantum\nobservables acting on the \"superspace\" of all metrics, regardless of whether\nthey play any role in the description of a specific physical system. On can\ninstead revisit the more humble \"minisuperspace\" approach and choose the\ngravitational observables not simply by imposing some symmetry, but motivated\nby their proven relevance in the (classical) description of a given system. In\nparticular, this review focuses on compact, spherically symmetric, quantum\nmechanical sources, in order to determine the probability they are black holes\nrather than regular particles. The gravitational radius is therefore lifted to\nthe status of a quantum mechanical operator acting on the \"horizon\nwave-function\", the latter being determined by the quantum state of the source.\nThis formalism is then applied to several sources with a mass around the\nfundamental scale, which are viewed as natural candidates of quantum black\nholes.\n", "  The Post Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase is arguably one of the least\nunderstood phases of the evolution of low- and intermediate- mass stars. The\ntwo grids of models presently available are based on outdated micro- and\nmacro-physics and do not agree with each other. We study the timescales of\npost-AGB and CSPNe in the context of our present understanding of the micro-\nand macro-physics of stars. We want to assess whether new post-AGB models,\nbased on the latter improvements in TP-AGB modeling, can help to understand the\ndiscrepancies between observation and theory and within theory itself. We\ncompute a grid of post-AGB full evolutionary sequences that include all\nprevious evolutionary stages from the Zero Age Main Sequence to the White Dwarf\nphase. Models are computed for initial masses between 0.8 and 4 $M_\\odot$ and\nfor a wide range of initial metallicities ($Z_0=$0.02, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001),\nthis allow us to provide post-AGB timescales and properties for H-burning\npost-AGB objects with masses in the relevant range for the formation of\nplanetary nebulae ($\\sim$ 0.5 - 0.8, $M_\\odot$).\n  We find post-AGB timescales that are at least $\\sim 3$ to $\\sim 10$ times\nshorter than those of old post-AGB stellar evolution models. This is true for\nthe whole mass and metallicity range. The new models are also $\\sim$ 0.1 - 0.3\ndex brighter than the previous models with similar remnant masses. Post-AGB\ntimescales show only a mild dependence on metallicity. The shorter post-AGB\ntimescales derived in the present work are in agreement with recent\nsemiempirical determinations of the post-AGB timescales from the CSPNe in the\nGalactic Bulge. Due to the very different post-AGB crossing times,\ninitial-final mass relation and luminosities of the present models, they will\nhave a significant impact in the predictions for the formation of planetary\nnebulae and the planetary nebulae luminosity function.\n", "  After the jet break at $t\\sim 1.4$ days, the optical afterglow emission of\nthe long-short burst GRB 060614 can be divided into two components. One is the\npower-law decaying forward shock afterglow emission. The other is an excess of\nflux in several multi-band photometric observations, which emerges at $\\sim$4\ndays after the burst, significantly earlier than that observed for a supernova\nassociated with a long-duration GRB. At $t>13.6$ days, the F814W-band flux\ndrops faster than $t^{-3.2}$. Moreover, the spectrum of the excess component is\nvery soft and the luminosity is extremely low. These observed signals are\nincompatible with those from weak supernovae, but the ejection of $\\sim\n0.1~M_\\odot$ of $r-$process material from a black hole-neutron star merger, as\nrecently found in some numerical simulations, can produce it. If this\ninterpretation is correct, it represents the first time that a multi-epoch/band\nlightcurve of a Li-Paczynski macronova (also known as kilonova) has been\nobtained and black hole-neutron star mergers are sites of significant\nproduction of $r-$process elements.\n", "  We show theoretically that near a fluid-fluid interface a single active\ncolloidal particle generating, e.g., chemicals or a temperature gradient\nexperiences an effective force of hydrodynamic origin. This force is due to the\nfluid flow driven by Marangoni stresses induced by the activity of the\nparticle; it decays very slowly with the distance from the interface, and can\nbe attractive or repulsive depending on how the activity modifies the surface\ntension. We show that, for typical systems, this interaction can dominate the\ndynamics of the particle as compared to Brownian motion, dispersion forces, or\nself-phoretic effects. In the attractive case, the interaction promotes the\nself-assembly of particles into a crystal-like monolayer at the interface.\n", "  We present the stellar kinematics across the Galactic bulge and into the disk\nat positive longitudes from the SDSS-III APOGEE spectroscopic survey of the\nMilky Way. APOGEE includes extensive coverage of the stellar populations of the\nbulge along the mid-plane and near-plane regions. From these data, we have\nproduced kinematic maps of 10,000 stars across longitudes 0 deg < l < 65 deg,\nand primarily across latitudes of |b| < 5 deg in the bulge region. The APOGEE\ndata reveal that the bulge is cylindrically rotating across all latitudes and\nis kinematically hottest at the very centre of the bulge, with the smallest\ngradients in both kinematic and chemical space inside the inner-most region\n(l,|b|) < (5,5) deg. The results from APOGEE show good agreement with data from\nother surveys at higher latitudes and a remarkable similarity to the rotation\nand dispersion maps of barred galaxies viewed edge on. The thin bar that is\nreported to be present in the inner disk within a narrow latitude range of |b|\n< 2 deg appears to have a corresponding signature in [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe].\nStars with [Fe/H] > -0.5 have dispersion and rotation profiles that are similar\nto that of N-body models of boxy/peanut bulges. There is a smooth kinematic\ntransition from the thin bar and boxy bulge (l,|b|) < (15,12) deg out into the\ndisk for stars with [Fe/H] > -1.0, and the chemodynamics across (l,b) suggests\nthe stars in the inner Galaxy with [Fe/H] > -1.0 have an origin in the disk.\n", "  The usefulness of generating random configurations is recognized in many\nareas of knowledge. Fortran was born for scientific computing and has been one\nof the main programming languages in this area since then. And several ongoing\nprojects targeting towards its betterment indicate that it will keep this\nstatus in the decades to come. In this article, we describe Fortran codes\nproduced, or organized, for the generation of the following random objects:\nnumbers, probability vectors, unitary matrices, and quantum state vectors and\ndensity matrices. Some matrix functions are also included and may be of\nindependent interest.\n", "  Turbulence, the complicated fluid behavior of nonlinear and statistical\nnature, arises in many physical systems across various disciplines, from tiny\nlaboratory scales to geophysical and astrophysical ones. The notion of\nturbulence in the quantum world was conceived long ago by Onsager and Feynman,\nbut the occurrence of turbulence in ultracold gases has been studied in the\nlaboratory only very recently. Albeit new as a field, it already offers new\npaths and perspectives on the problem of turbulence. Herein we review the\ngeneral properties of quantum gases at ultralow temperatures paying particular\nattention to vortices, their dynamics and turbulent behavior. We review the\nrecent advances both from theory and experiment. We highlight, moreover, the\ndifficulties of identifying and characterizing turbulence in gaseous\nBose-Einstein condensates compared to ordinary turbulence and turbulence in\nsuperfluid liquid helium and spotlight future possible directions.\n", "  Despite its continued observational successes, there is a persistent (and\ngrowing) interest in extending cosmology beyond the standard model,\n$\\Lambda$CDM. This is motivated by a range of apparently serious theoretical\nissues, involving such questions as the cosmological constant problem, the\nparticle nature of dark matter, the validity of general relativity on large\nscales, the existence of anomalies in the CMB and on small scales, and the\npredictivity and testability of the inflationary paradigm. In this paper, we\nsummarize the current status of $\\Lambda$CDM as a physical theory, and review\ninvestigations into possible alternatives along a number of different lines,\nwith a particular focus on highlighting the most promising directions. While\nthe fundamental problems are proving reluctant to yield, the study of\nalternative cosmologies has led to considerable progress, with much more to\ncome if hopes about forthcoming high-precision observations and new theoretical\nideas are fulfilled.\n", "  We present 13 high-precision and four additional light curves of four bright\nsouthern-hemisphere transiting planetary systems: WASP-22, WASP-41, WASP-42 and\nWASP-55. In the cases of WASP-42 and WASP-55, these are the first follow-up\nobservations since their discovery papers. We present refined measurements of\nthe physical properties and orbital ephemerides of all four systems. No\nindications of transit timing variations were seen. All four planets have radii\ninflated above those expected from theoretical models of gas-giant planets;\nWASP-55b is the most discrepant with a mass of 0.63 Mjup and a radius of 1.34\nRjup. WASP-41 shows brightness anomalies during transit due to the planet\nocculting spots on the stellar surface. Two anomalies observed 3.1 d apart are\nvery likely due to the same spot. We measure its change in position and\ndetermine a rotation period for the host star of 18.6 +/- 1.5 d, in good\nagreement with a published measurement from spot-induced brightness modulation,\nand a sky-projected orbital obliquity of lambda = 6 +/- 11 degrees. We conclude\nwith a compilation of obliquity measurements from spot-tracking analyses and a\ndiscussion of this technique in the study of the orbital configurations of hot\nJupiters.\n", "  Fornax is the brightest Milky Way (MW) dwarf spheroidal galaxy and its star\nformation history (SFH) has been derived from observations. We estimate the\ntime evolution of its gas mass and net inflow and outflow rates from the SFH\nusing a simple star formation law that relates the star formation rate to the\ngas mass. We present a chemical evolution model on a 2D mass grid with\nsupernovae (SNe) as sources of metal enrichment. We find that a key parameter\ncontrolling the enrichment is the mass M_x of the gas to mix with the ejecta\nfrom each SN. The choice of M_x depends on the evolution of SN remnants and on\nthe global gas dynamics. It differs between the two types of SNe involved and\nbetween the periods before and after Fornax became an MW satellite at time t =\nt_sat . Our results indicate that due to the global gas outflow at t > t_sat ,\npart of the ejecta from each SN may directly escape from Fornax. Sample results\nfrom our model are presented and compared with data.\n", "  We revisit gravitino production following inflation. As a first step, we\nreview the standard calculation of gravitino production in the thermal plasma\nformed at the end of post-inflationary reheating when the inflaton has\ncompletely decayed. Next we consider gravitino production prior to the\ncompletion of reheating, assuming that the inflaton decay products thermalize\ninstantaneously while they are still dilute. We then argue that instantaneous\nthermalization is in general a good approximation, and also show that the\ncontribution of non-thermal gravitino production via the collisions of inflaton\ndecay products prior to thermalization is relatively small. Our final estimate\nof the gravitino-to-entropy ratio is approximated well by a standard\ncalculation of gravitino production in the post-inflationary thermal plasma\nassuming total instantaneous decay and thermalization at a time $t \\simeq\n1.2/\\Gamma_\\phi$. Finally, in light of our calculations, we consider potential\nimplications of upper limits on the gravitino abundance for models of\ninflation, with particular attention to scenarios for inflaton decays in\nsupersymmetric Starobinsky-like models.\n", "  Using the KEPLER hydrodynamics code, 464 models of thermonuclear X-ray\nbursters were performed across a range of accretion rates and compositions. We\npresent the library of simulated burst profiles from this sample, and examine\nvariations in the simulated lightcurve for different model conditions. We find\nthat the recurrence time varies as a power law against accretion rate, and\nmeasure its slope while mixed H/He burning is occurring for a range of\nmetallicities, finding the power law gradient to vary from $\\eta = 1.1$ to\n$1.24$. We also identify the accretion rates at which mixed H/He burning stops\nand a transition occurs to different burning regimes. We also explore how\nvarying the accretion rate and metallicity affects burst morphology in both the\nrise and tail.\n", "  The Type Ia supernova progenitor problem is one of the most perplexing and\nexciting problems in astrophysics, requiring detailed numerical modeling to\ncomplement observations of these explosions. One possible progenitor that has\nmerited recent theoretical attention is the white dwarf merger scenario, which\nhas the potential to naturally explain many of the observed characteristics of\nType Ia supernovae. To date there have been relatively few self-consistent\nsimulations of merging white dwarf systems using mesh-based hydrodynamics. This\nis the first paper in a series describing simulations of these systems using a\nhydrodynamics code with adaptive mesh refinement. In this paper we describe our\nnumerical methodology and discuss our implementation in the compressible\nhydrodynamics code CASTRO, which solves the Euler equations, and the Poisson\nequation for self-gravity, and couples the gravitational and rotation forces to\nthe hydrodynamics. Standard techniques for coupling gravitation and rotation\nforces to the hydrodynamics do not adequately conserve the total energy of the\nsystem for our problem, but recent advances in the literature allow progress\nand we discuss our implementation here. We present a set of test problems\ndemonstrating the extent to which our software sufficiently models a system\nwhere large amounts of mass are advected on the computational domain over long\ntimescales. Future papers in this series will describe our treatment of the\ninitial conditions of these systems and will examine the early phases of the\nmerger to determine its viability for triggering a thermonuclear detonation.\n", "  We study the molecular content and the star formation efficiency of 21 Blue\nCompact Dwarfs (BCDs). We present CO(1-0) and (2-1) observations, further\nsupplemented with additional CO measurements and multiwavelength ancillary data\nfrom the literature. We find the CO luminosity to be correlated with the\nstellar and HI masses, SFR tracers, the size of the starburst and its\nmetallicity. BCDs appear offset from the Schmidt-Kennicutt (SK) law, showing\nextremely low ($\\lesssim$0.1 Gyr) H2 and H2+HI depletion timescales. The\ndeparture from the SK law is smaller when considering H2+HI rather than H2\nonly, and is larger for BCDs with lower metallicity and higher specific SFR.\nThus, the molecular fraction and H2 depletion timescale of BCDs is found to be\nstrongly correlated with metallicity. Using this and assuming that the\nempirical correlation found between the specific SFR and galaxy-averaged H2\ndepletion timescale of more metal-rich galaxies extends to lower masses, we\nderive a metallicity-dependent CO-to-H2 conversion factor $\\alpha_{CO, Z}\n\\propto (Z/Z_{\\odot})^{-y}$, with $y=1.5(\\pm 0.3)$ in qualitative agreement\nwith previous determinations, dust-based measurements, and recent model\npredictions. Our results suggest that in vigorously star-forming dwarfs the\nfraction of H2 traced by CO decreases by a factor of about 40 from $Z \\sim\nZ_{\\odot}$ to $Z \\sim 0.1 Z_{\\odot}$, leading to a strong underestimation of\nthe H2 mass in metal-poor systems when a Galactic $\\alpha_{CO, MW}$ is\nconsidered. Adopting $\\alpha_{CO, Z}$ we find that departures from the SK law\nare partially resolved. Our results suggest that starbursting dwarfs have\nshorter depletion gas timescales and lower molecular fractions compared to\nnormal late-type disc galaxies even accounting for the molecular gas not traced\nby CO emission in metal-poor environments, raising additional constraints to\nmodel predictions (Abridged).\n", "  The publications of the last three years concerning the study of the most\nintriguing fine structure in type IV solar radio bursts, zebra pattern (ZP),\nare surveyed. The main attention is paid to new observations, irrespective of\nwhether a paper includes detailed interpretation of an event or simply reports\nthe beginning of operation of a new tool. The radiation mechanism of a ZP on a\ndouble plasma resonance (DPR) remains the most widespread and standard, though\nten alternative mechanisms have been offered. However, in a number of works\ndifficulties with the explanation of a complex zebra are noted, especially in\ncombination with fiber bursts and spikes. Therefore, several papers in which\ndescription of the radiation mechanism of a ZP on the DPR is improved are\nconsidered in more detail. Without positional observations we have a great\nopportunity to follow the dynamics of flare processes using SDO / AIA images in\nseveral EUV lines. In the discussion, the debatable questions regarding the\ncomparison of mechanisms associated with DPR in terms of the model of\ninteraction of plasma waves with whistlers are illuminated.\n", "  We investigate transport properties of different realizations of\none-dimensional quantum wires coupled to a number of external electrodes in\nterms of the full counting statistics. Focusing on the set-ups in which edge\nstates of Majorana type are realizable we analyze the effects of the exchange\nof charge carriers with the environment. We find a very strong suppression of\nthe non-local current correlations, which decay exponentially with the coupling\nstrength and the wire length. The local properties such as transport currents\nand current correlations measured at individual contacts between the wire and\nexternal electrode turn out to develop asymmetry when energy-resolved. We\nprovide a number of exact analytical solutions and discuss experimental\nimplications of our findings.\n", "  Electron-positron pair production in space- and time-dependent\nelectromagnetic fields is investigated. Especially, the influence of a\ntime-dependent, inhomogeneous magnetic field on the particle momenta and the\ntotal particle yield is analyzed for the first time. The role of the Lorentz\ninvariant $\\mathbf{E}^2 - \\mathbf{B}^2$, including its sign and local values,\nin the pair creation process is emphasized.\n", "  We demonstrate that full description of both electromagnetic and\ngravitational radiation from massless particles lies outside the scope of\nclassical theory. Synchrotron radiation from the hypothetical massless charge\nin quantum electrodynamics in external magnetic field has finite total power\nwhile the corresponding classical formula diverges in the massless limit. We\nargue that in both cases classical theory describes correctly only the\nlow-frequency part of the spectra, while the total power diverges because of\nabsence of the UV frequency cutoff. Failure of description of gravitational\nradiation from massless particles by classical General Relativity may be\nconsidered as another appeal for quantization of gravity apart from the problem\nof singularities.\n", "  We present a comprehensive review of the In-Medium Similarity Renormalization\nGroup (IM-SRG), a novel ab inito method for nuclei. The IM-SRG employs a\ncontinuous unitary transformation of the many-body Hamiltonian to decouple the\nground state from all excitations, thereby solving the many-body problem.\nStarting from a pedagogical introduction of the underlying concepts, the IM-SRG\nflow equations are developed for systems with and without explicit spherical\nsymmetry. We study different IM-SRG generators that achieve the desired\ndecoupling, and how they affect the details of the IM-SRG flow. Based on\ncalculations of closed-shell nuclei, we assess possible truncations for closing\nthe system of flow equations in practical applications, as well as choices of\nthe reference state. We discuss the issue of center-of-mass factorization and\ndemonstrate that the IM-SRG ground-state wave function exhibits an approximate\ndecoupling of intrinsic and center-of-mass degrees of freedom, similar to\nCoupled Cluster (CC) wave functions. To put the IM-SRG in context with other\nmany-body methods, in particular many-body perturbation theory and\nnon-perturbative approaches like CC, a detailed perturbative analysis of the\nIM-SRG flow equations is carried out. We conclude with a discussion of ongoing\ndevelopments, including IM-SRG calculations with three-nucleon forces, the\nmulti-reference IM-SRG for open-shell nuclei, first non-perturbative\nderivations of shell- model interactions, and the consistent evolution of\noperators in the IM-SRG. We dedicate this review to the memory of Gerry Brown,\none of the pioneers of many-body calculations of nuclei.\n", "  When a contaminant diffuses on the surface of a nanomechanical resonator, the\nmotions of the two become correlated. Despite being a high-order effect in the\nresonator-particle coupling, such correlations affect the system dynamics by\ninducing dissipation of the resonator energy. Here, we consider this\ndiffusion-induced dissipation in the cases of multiple particles adsorbed on\ncarbon nanotube and graphene resonators. By solving the stochastic equations of\nmotion, we simulate the ringdown of the resonator, in order to determine the\nresonator energy decay rate. We find two different scalings with the number of\nadsorbed particles $K$ and particle mass $m$. In the regime where the\nadsorbates are inertially trapped at an antinode of vibration, the dissipation\nrate $\\Gamma$ scales with the total adsorbed mass $\\Gamma\\propto Km$. In\ncontrast, in the regime where particles diffuse freely over the resonator, the\ndissipation rate scales as the product of the total adsorbed mass and the\nindividual particle mass: $\\Gamma\\propto Km^2$.\n", "  We have selected a sample of 80 candidates for obscured radio-loud active\ngalactic nuclei and presented their basic optical/near-infrared (NIR)\nproperties in Paper 1. In this paper, we present both high-resolution radio\ncontinuum images for all of these sources and HI 21cm absorption spectroscopy\nfor a few selected sources in this sample. A-configuration 4.9 and 8.5 GHz VLA\ncontinuum observations find that 52 sources are compact or have substantial\ncompact components with size <0.5\" and flux density >0.1 Jy at 4.9 GHz. The\nmost compact 36 sources were then observed with the VLBA at 1.4 GHz. One\ndefinite and 10 candidate Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) are newly\nidentified, a detection rate of CSOs ~3 times higher than the detection rate\npreviously found in purely flux-limited samples. Based on possessing compact\ncomponents with high flux densities, 60 of these sources are good candidates\nfor absorption-line searches. Twenty seven sources were observed for HI 21cm\nabsorption at their photometric or spectroscopic redshifts with only 6\ndetections made (one detection is tentative). However, five of these were from\na small subset of six CSOs with pure galaxy optical/NIR spectra and for which\naccurate spectroscopic redshifts place the redshifted 21cm line in a RFI-free\nspectral window. It is likely that the presence of ubiquitous RFI and the\nabsence of accurate spectroscopic redshifts preclude HI detections in similar\nsources (only one detection out of the remaining 22 sources observed, 14 of\nwhich have only photometric redshifts). Future searches for highly-redshifted\nHI and molecular absorption can easily find more distant CSOs among bright,\nblank field' radio sources but will be severely hampered by an inability to\ndetermine accurate spectroscopic redshifts for them due to their lack of\nrest-frame UV continuum.\n", "  We have calculated the values of critical packing fractions for the mixtures\nof symmetric non-additive hard disks. An interesting feature of the model is\nthe fact that the internal energy is zero and the phase transitions are\nentropically driven. A cluster algorithm for Monte Carlo simulations in a\nsemigrand ensemble was used. The finite size scaling analysis was employed to\ncompute the critical packing fractions for infinite systems with high accuracy\nfor a range of non-additivity parameters wider than in the previous studies.\n", "  The primary Kepler Mission provided nearly continuous monitoring of ~200,000\nobjects with unprecedented photometric precision. We present the final catalog\nof eclipsing binary systems within the 105 square degree Kepler field of view.\nThis release incorporates the full extent of the data from the primary mission\n(Q0-Q17 Data Release). As a result, new systems have been added, additional\nfalse positives have been removed, ephemerides and principal parameters have\nbeen recomputed, classifications have been revised to rely on analytical\nmodels, and eclipse timing variations have been computed for each system. We\nidentify several classes of systems including those that exhibit tertiary\neclipse events, systems that show clear evidence of additional bodies,\nheartbeat systems, systems with changing eclipse depths, and systems exhibiting\nonly one eclipse event over the duration of the mission. We have updated the\nperiod and galactic latitude distribution diagrams and included a catalog\ncompleteness evaluation. The total number of identified eclipsing and\nellipsoidal binary systems in the Kepler field of view has increased to 2878,\n1.3% of all observed Kepler targets. An online version of this catalog with\ndownloadable content and visualization tools is maintained at\nhttp://keplerEBs.villanova.edu.\n", "  We study phase behaviour of a model fluid confined between two unlike\nparallel walls in the presence of long range (dispersion) forces. Predictions\nobtained from macroscopic (geometric) and mesoscopic arguments are compared\nwith numerical solutions of a non-local density functional theory. Two\ncapillary models are considered. For a capillary comprising of two\n(differently) adsorbing walls we show that simple geometric arguments lead to\nthe generalized Kelvin equation locating capillary condensation very\naccurately, provided both walls are only partially wet. If at least one of the\nwalls is in complete wetting regime, the Kelvin equation should be modified by\ncapturing the effect of thick wetting films by including Derjaguin's\ncorrection. Within the second model, we consider a capillary formed of two\ncompeting walls, so that one tends to be wet and the other dry. In this case,\nan interface localized-delocalized transition occurs at bulk two-phase\ncoexistence and a temperature $T^*(L)$ depending on the pore width $L$. A\nmean-field analysis shows that for walls exhibiting first-order wetting\ntransition at a temperature $T_{w}$, $T_{s}>T^*(L)>T_{w}$, where the spinodal\ntemperature $T_{s}$ can be associated with the prewetting critical point, which\nalso determines a critical pore width below which the interface\nlocalized-delocalized transition does not occur. If the walls exhibit critical\nwetting, the transition is shifted below $T_{w}$ and for a model with the\nbinding potential $W(\\ell)=A(T)\\ell^{-2}+B(T)\\ell^{-3}+\\cdots$, where $\\ell$ is\nthe location of the liquid-gas interface, the transition can be characterized\nby a dimensionless parameter $\\kappa=B/(AL)$, so that the fluid configuration\nwith delocalized interface is stable in the interval between $\\kappa=-2/3$ and\n$\\kappa\\approx-0.23$.\n", "  We present high-resolution multiwavelength radio continuum images of the\nregion within 150$\"$ of Sgr A*, revealing a number of new extended features and\nstellar sources in this region. First, we detect a continuous 2\" east-west\nridge of radio emission, linking Sgr A* and a cluster of stars associated with\nIRS 13N and IRS 13E. The ridge suggests that an outflow of east-west blob-like\nstructures is emerging from Sgr A*. We also find arc-like features within the\nridge with morphologies suggestive of photoevaporative protoplanetary disks. We\nuse near-IR fluxes to show that the emission has similar characteristics to\nthose of a protoplanetary disk irradiated by the intense radiation field at the\nGalactic center. This suggests that star formation has taken place within the S\ncluster 2$\"$ from Sgr A*. We suggest that the diffuse X-ray emission associated\nwith Sgr A* is due to an expanding hot wind produced by the mass loss from\nB-type main sequence stars, and/or the disks of photoevaporation of low mass\nYSOs at a rate ~10^{-6} solar mass per year. The proposed model naturally\nreduces the inferred accretion rate and is an alternative to the inflow-outflow\nstyle models to explain the underluminous nature of Sgr A*. Second, we detect\nnew cometary radio and nea-IR sources and a striking tower of radio emission\nsuggesting that they are tracing interaction sites of a mildly relativistic jet\nfrom Sgr A* with the atmosphere of stars and the nonthermal Sgr A East shell at\na PA$\\sim50-60^\\circ$ with ~10^{-7} solar mass per year, and opening angle 10\ndegrees.\n", "  The influence of an external test mass on the phase of the signal of an atom\ninterferometer is studied theoretically. Using traditional techniques in atom\noptics based on the density matrix equations in the Wigner representation, we\nare able to extract the various contributions to the phase of the signal\nassociated with the classical motion of the atoms, the quantum correction to\nthis motion resulting from atomic recoil that is produced when the atoms\ninteract with Raman field pulses, and quantum corrections to the atomic motion\nthat occur in the time between the Raman field pulses. By increasing the\neffective wave vector associated with the Raman field pulses using modified\nfield parameters, we can increase the sensitivity of the signal to the point\nwhere the quantum corrections can be measured. The expressions that are derived\ncan be evaluated numerically to isolate the contribution to the signal from an\nexternal test mass. The regions of validity of the exact and approximate\nexpressions are determined.\n", "  The metallicity distribution function of globular clusters (GCs) in galaxies\nis a key to understanding galactic formation and evolution. The calcium II\ntriplet (CaT) index has recently become a popular metal abundance indicator\nthanks to its sensitivity to GC metallicity. Here we revisit and assess the\nreliability of CaT as a metallicity indicator using our new stellar population\nsynthesis simulations based on empirical, high-resolution fluxes. The model\nshows that the CaT strength of old ($>$ 10 Gyr) GCs is proportional to ${\\rm\n[Fe/H]}$ below $-0.5$. In the modest metal-rich regime, however, CaT does not\nincrease anymore with ${\\rm [Fe/H]}$ due to the little contribution from\ncoolest red giant stars to the CaT absorption. The nonlinear nature of the\ncolor--$CaT$ relation is confirmed by the observations of GCs in nearby\nearly-type galaxies. This indicates that the CaT should be used carefully when\nderiving metallicities of metal-rich stellar populations. Our results offer an\nexplanation for the observed sharp difference between the color and $CaT$\ndistributions of GCs in the same galaxies. We take this as an analogy to the\nview that metallicity--color and metallicity--Lick index nonlinearity of GCs is\nprimarily responsible for their observed \"bimodal\" distributions of colors and\nabsorption indices.\n", "  Within Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo, we investigate how\nthe statistical error behaves as a function of the parameters which control the\nstochastic sampling. We define the inefficiency as a measure of the statistical\nerror per particle sampling the space and per timestep and show there is a\nsizeable parameter regime where this is minimised. We find that this\ninefficiency increases sublinearly with Hilbert space size and can be reduced\nby localising the canonical Hartree--Fock molecular orbitals, suggesting that\nthe choice of basis impacts the method beyond that of the sign problem.\n", "  We consider the role of the dwarf planet Ceres on the secular dynamics of the\nasteroid main belt. Specifically, we examine the post impact evolution of\nasteroid families due to the interaction of their members with the linear nodal\nsecular resonance with Ceres. First, we find the location of this resonance and\nidentify which asteroid families are crossed by its path. Next, we summarize\nour results for three asteroid families, namely (1726) Hoffmeister, (1128)\nAstrid and (1521) Seinajoki which have irregular distributions of their members\nin the proper elements space, indicative of the effect of the resonance. We\nconfirm this by performing a set of numerical simulations, showcasing that the\nperturbing action of Ceres through its linear nodal secular resonance is\nessential to reproduce the actual shape of the families.\n", "  The COSMOS-Legacy survey is a 4.6 Ms Chandra program that has imaged 2.2\ndeg$^2$ of the COSMOS field with an effective exposure of $\\simeq$160 ks over\nthe central 1.5 deg$^2$ and of $\\simeq$80 ks in the remaining area. The survey\nis the combination of 56 new observations, obtained as an X-ray Visionary\nProject, with the previous C-COSMOS survey. We describe the reduction and\nanalysis of the new observations and the properties of 2273 point sources\ndetected above a spurious probability of 2$\\times 10^{-5}$. We also present the\nupdated properties of the C-COSMOS sources detected in the new data. The whole\nsurvey includes 4016 point sources (3814, 2920 and 2440 in the full, soft and\nhard band). The limiting depths are 2.2 $\\times$ 10$^{-16}$, 1.5 $\\times$\n10$^{-15}$ and 8.9$\\times$ 10$^{-16}$ ${\\rm erg~cm}^{-2}~{\\rm s}^{-1}$ in the\n0.5-2, 2-10 and 0.5-10 keV bands, respectively. The observed fraction of\nobscured AGN with column density $> 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ from the hardness ratio\n(HR) is $\\sim$50$^{+17}_{-16}$%. Given the large sample, we compute source\nnumber counts in the hard and soft bands, significantly reducing the\nuncertainties of 5-10%. For the first time, we compute number counts for\nobscured (HR$>$-0.2) and unobscured (HR$<$-0.2) sources and find significant\ndifferences between the two populations in the soft band. Due to the\nun-precedent large exposure, COSMOS-Legacy area is 3 times larger than surveys\nat similar depth and its depth is 3 times fainter than surveys covering similar\narea. The area-flux region occupied by COSMOS-Legacy is likely to remain\nunsurpassed for years to come.\n", "  Context. Groups form the most abundant class of galaxy systems. They act as\nthe principal drivers of galaxy evolution and can be used as tracers of the\nlarge-scale structure and the underlying cosmology. However, the detection of\ngalaxy groups from galaxy redshift survey data is hampered by several\nobservational limitations.\n  Aims. We improve the widely used friends-of-friends (FoF) group finding\nalgorithm with membership refinement procedures and apply the method to a\ncombined dataset of galaxies in the local Universe. A major aim of the\nrefinement is to detect subgroups within the FoF groups, enabling a more\nreliable suppression of the fingers-of-God effect.\n  Methods. The FoF algorithm is often suspected of leaving subsystems of groups\nand clusters undetected. We used a galaxy sample built of the 2MRS, CF2, and\n2M++ survey data comprising nearly 80000 galaxies within the local volume of\n430 Mpc radius to detect FoF groups. We conducted a multimodality check on the\ndetected groups in search for subgroups. We furthermore refined group\nmembership using the group virial radius and escape velocity to expose unbound\ngalaxies. We used the virial theorem to estimate group masses.\n  Results. The analysis results in a catalogue of 6282 galaxy groups in the\n2MRS sample with two or more members, together with their mass estimates. About\nhalf of the initial FoF groups with ten or more members were split into smaller\nsystems with the multimodality check. An interesting comparison to our detected\ngroups is provided by another group catalogue that is based on similar data but\na completely different methodology. Two thirds of the groups are identical or\nvery similar. Differences mostly concern the smallest and largest of these\nother groups, the former sometimes missing and the latter being divided into\nsubsystems in our catalogue.\n", "  We study the nature of excitons bound to I1 basal plane stacking faults in\nensembles of ultrathin GaN nanowires by continuous-wave and time-resolved\nphotoluminescence spectroscopy. These ultrathin nanowires, obtained by the\nthermal decomposition of spontaneously formed GaN nanowire ensembles, are\ntapered and have tip diameters down to 6 nm. With decreasing nanowire diameter,\nwe observe a strong blue shift of the transition originating from the radiative\ndecay of stacking fault-bound excitons. Moreover, the radiative lifetime of\nthis transition in the ultrathin nanowires is independent of temperature up to\n60 K and significantly longer than that of the corresponding transition in\nas-grown nanowires. These findings reveal a zero-dimensional character of the\nconfined exciton state and thus demonstrate that I1 stacking faults in\nultrathin nanowires act as genuine quantum dots.\n", "  We analyze evolution of the single particle excitation spectrum of the\nunderdoped cuprate superconductors near the anti-nodal region, considering\ntemperatures below and and above the phase transition. We inspect the\nphenomenological self-energy that reproduces the\nangle-resolved-photoemission-spectroscopy (ARPES) data and we show that above\nthe critical temperature, such procedure implies a transfer of the spectral\nweight from the Bogoliubov-type quasiparticles towards the in-gap damped\nstates. We also discuss some possible microscopic arguments explaining this\nprocess.\n", "  Mass models of galactic disks traditionally rely on axisymmetric density and\nrotation curves, paradoxically acting as if their most remarkable asymmetric\nfeatures, such as lopsidedness or spiral arms, were not important. In this\narticle, we relax the axisymmetry approximation and introduce a methodology\nthat derives 3D gravitational potentials of disk-like objects and robustly\nestimates the impacts of asymmetries on circular velocities in the disk\nmidplane. Mass distribution models can then be directly fitted to asymmetric\nline-of-sight velocity fields. Applied to the grand-design spiral M99, the new\nstrategy shows that circular velocities are highly nonuniform, particularly in\nthe inner disk of the galaxy, as a natural response to the perturbed\ngravitational potential of luminous matter. A cuspy inner density profile of\ndark matter is found in M99, in the usual case where luminous and dark matter\nshare the same center. The impact of the velocity nonuniformity is to make the\ninner profile less steep, although the density remains cuspy. On another hand,\na model where the halo is core dominated and shifted by 2.2-2.5 kpc from the\nluminous mass center is more appropriate to explain most of the kinematical\nlopsidedness evidenced in the velocity field of M99. However, the gravitational\npotential of luminous baryons is not asymmetric enough to explain the\nkinematical lopsidedness of the innermost regions, irrespective of the density\nshape of dark matter. This discrepancy points out the necessity of an\nadditional dynamical process in these regions: possibly a lopsided distribution\nof dark matter.\n", "  Extremely metal-poor (XMP) galaxies are defined to have gas-phase metallicity\nsmaller than a tenth of the solar value (12 + log[O/H] < 7.69). They are\nuncommon, chemically and possibly dynamically primitive, with physical\nconditions characteristic of earlier phases of the Universe. We search for new\nXMPs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in a work that complements Paper I.\nThis time high electron temperature objects are selected; since metals are a\nmain coolant of the gas, metal- poor objects contain high-temperature gas.\nUsing the algorithm k-means, we classify 788677 spectra to select 1281 galaxies\nhaving particularly intense [OIII]4363 with respect to [OIII]5007, which is a\nproxy for high electron temperature. The metallicity of these candidates was\ncomputed using a hybrid technique consistent with the direct method, rendering\n196 XMPs. A less restrictive noise constraint provides a larger set with 332\ncandidates. Both lists are provided in electronic format. The selected XMP\nsample have mean stellar mass around 10^8Msun, with dust-mass \\sim 10^3Msun for\ntypical star-forming regions. In agreement with previous findings, XMPs show a\ntendency to be tadpole-like or cometary. Their underlying stellar continuum\ncorresponds to a fairly young stellar population (< 1Gyr), although young and\naged stellar populations co-exists at the low-metallicity starbursts. About 10%\nof the XMPs shows large N/O. Based on their location in constrained\ncosmological numerical simulations, XMPs have a strong tendency to appear in\nvoids and to avoid galaxy clusters. The puzzling 2%-solar low-metallicity\nthreshold exhibited by XMPs remains.\n", "  Compact binary mergers may have already been observed as they are the leading\nmodel for short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). Radioactive decay within the ejecta\nfrom these mergers is expected to produce an infra-red flare, dubbed macronova\n(or kilonova), on a time scale of a week. Recently two such macronova\ncandidates were identified in followup observations of sGRBs, strengthening the\npossibility that those indeed arise from mergers. The same ejecta will also\nproduce a long term (months to years) radio emission due to its interaction\nwith the surrounding ISM. In search for this emission, we observed the two\nmacronova candidates, GRB 130603B and GRB 060614 with the Jansky very large\narray (VLA) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). Our observations\nresulted in null-detections, putting strong upper limits on the kinetic energy\nand mass of the ejecta. A possible outcome of a merger is a highly magnetized\nneutron star (a magnetar), which has been suggested as the central engine for\nGRBs. Such a magnetar will deposit a significant fraction of its energy into\nthe ejecta leading to a brighter radio flare. Our results, therefore, rule out\nmagnetars in these two events.\n", "  Binary stars provide an ideal laboratory for investigating the potential\neffects of planet formation on stellar composition. Assuming the stars formed\nin the same environment/from the same material, any compositional anomalies\nbetween binary components might indicate differences in how material was\nsequestered in planets, or accreted by the star in the process of planet\nformation. We present here a study of the elemental abundance differences\nbetween WASP-94AB, a pair of stars that each host a hot Jupiter exoplanet. The\ntwo stars are very similar in spectral type (F8 and F9), and their ~2700 AU\nseparation suggests their protoplanetary disks were likely not influenced by\nstellar interactions, but WASP-94Ab's orbit -- misaligned with the host star\nspin axis and likely retrograde -- points towards a dynamically active\nformation mechanism, perhaps different than that of WASP-94Bb, which is not\nmisaligned and has nearly circular orbit. Based on our high-quality spectra and\nstrictly relative abundance analysis, we detect a depletion of volatiles\n(~-0.02 dex, on average) and enhancement of refractories (~0.01 dex) in\nWASP-94A relative to B (standard errors are ~0.005 dex). This is different than\nevery other published case of binary host star abundances, in which either no\nsignificant abundance differences are reported, or there is some degree of\nenhancement in all elements, including volatiles. Several scenarios that may\nexplain the abundance trend are discussed, but none can be definitively\naccepted or rejected. Additional high-contrast imaging observations to search\nfor companions that may be dynamically affecting the system, as well as a\nlarger sample of binary host star studies, are needed to better understand the\ncurious abundance trends we observe in WASP-94AB.\n", "  We report on a completely analytical calculation of the field anomalous\ndimension $\\gamma_{\\varphi}$ and the critical exponent $\\eta$ for the\n$O(n)$-symmetric $\\varphi^4$ model at the record six loop level. We\nsuccessfully compare our result for $\\gamma_{\\varphi}$ with $n=1$ with the\npredictions based on the method of the Borel resummation combined with a\nconformal mapping. Predictions for seven loop contribution to the field\nanomalous dimensions are given.\n", "  We present the results of a survey for HI 21-cm and OH 18-cm absorption in\nseven strong CO emitters at z > 3. Despite reaching limits comparable to those\nrequired to detect 21-cm absorption at lower redshifts, we do not detect either\ntransition in any of the objects searched. We believe that this is due to the\nhigh redshift selection causing all of our targets to have ultra-violet\nluminosities above the critical value, where all of the atomic gas in the host\ngalaxy disk is suspected to be ionised. However, not only are all of our\ntargets bright in CO emission, but detection of CO above the critical UV\nluminosity is generally not uncommon. This suggests that the molecular gas is\nshielded from the radiation or is physically remote from the source of the\ncontinuum emission, as it appears to be from CO observations of high redshift\nradio galaxies.\n", "  Observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect provide information on\nstar-planet alignments, which can inform planetary migration and evolution\ntheories. Here, we go beyond the classical RM modelling and explore the impact\nof a convective blueshift that varies across the stellar disc and non-Gaussian\nstellar photospheric profiles. We simulated an aligned hot Jupiter with a 4 d\norbit about a Sun-like star and injected centre-to-limb velocity (and profile\nshape) variations based on radiative 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of\nsolar surface convection. The residuals between our modelling and classical RM\nmodelling were dependent on the intrinsic profile width and v sin i; the\namplitude of the residuals increased with increasing v sin i, and with\ndecreasing intrinsic profile width. For slowly rotating stars the\ncentre-to-limb convective variation dominated the residuals (with amplitudes of\n10s of cm/s to ~1 m/s); however, for faster rotating stars the dominant\nresidual signature was due a non-Gaussian intrinsic profile (with amplitudes\nfrom 0.5-9 m/s). When the impact factor was 0, neglecting to account for the\nconvective centre-to-limb variation led to an uncertainty in the obliquity of\n~10-20 degrees, even though the true v sin i was known. Additionally,\nneglecting to properly model an asymmetric intrinsic profile had a greater\nimpact for more rapidly rotating stars (e.g. v sin i = 6 km/s), and caused\nsystematic errors on the order of ~20 degrees in the measured obliquities.\nHence, neglecting the impact of stellar surface convection may bias star-planet\nalignment measurements and consequently also theories on planetary migration\nand evolution.\n", "  Deflection missions to near-Earth asteroids will encounter non-negligible\nuncertainties in the physical and orbital parameters of the target object. In\norder to reliably assess future impact threat mitigation operations such\nuncertainties have to be quantified and incorporated into the mission design.\nThe implementation of deflection demonstration missions offers the great\nopportunity to test our current understanding of deflection relevant\nuncertainties and their consequences, e.g., regarding kinetic impacts on\nasteroid surfaces. In this contribution, we discuss the role of uncertainties\nin the NEOTwIST asteroid deflection demonstration concept, a low-cost kinetic\nimpactor design elaborated in the framework of the NEOShield project. The aim\nof NEOTwIST is to change the spin state of a known and well characterized\nnear-Earth object, in this case the asteroid (25143) Itokawa. Fast events such\nas the production of the impact crater and ejecta are studied via cube-sat\nchasers and a flyby vehicle. Long term changes, for instance, in the asteroid's\nspin and orbit, can be assessed using ground based observations. We find that\nsuch a mission can indeed provide valuable constraints on mitigation relevant\nparameters. Furthermore, the here proposed kinetic impact scenarios can be\nimplemented within the next two decades without threatening Earth's safety.\n", "  We use the $f^{2}FF$ model to study the generation of primordial magnetic\nfields (PMF) in the context of large field inflation (LFI), described by the\npotential, $V \\sim M \\phi^{p}$. We compute the magnetic and electric spectra\nfor all possible values of the model parameters under de Sitter and power law\nexpansion. We show that scale invariant PMF are not obtained in LFI to first\norder in the slow roll approximation, if we impose the constraint\n$V(\\phi=0)\\sim 0$. Alternatively, if these constraints are relaxed, the scale\ninvariant PMF can be generated. The associated electric field energy can fall\nbelow the energy density of inflation, $\\rho_{\\rm{Inf}}$ for the ranges of\ncomoving wavenumbers, $ k > 8 \\times 10^{-7} \\rm{Mpc^{-1}}$ and $ k > 4 \\times\n10^{-6} \\rm{Mpc^{-1}}$ in de Sitter and power law (PL) expansion. Further, it\ncan drop below $\\rho_{\\rm{Inf}}$ on the ranges, e-foldings $N > 51$, $p<1.66$,\n$p >2.03$, $l_0 > 3 \\times 10^5 {M_{\\rm{Pl}}}^{-1} (H_i < 3.3 \\times 10^{-6}\nM_{\\rm{Pl}})$, and $M > 2.8 \\times 10^{-3} M_{\\rm{Pl}}$. All of the above\nranges fit with the observational constraints.\n", "  (Abridged) The archetypal Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548 was observed in 2013-2014\nin the context of an extensive multiwavelength campaign, which revealed the\nsource to be in an extraordinary state of persistent heavy obscuration. We\nre-analyzed the archival grating spectra obtained by XMM-Newton and Chandra\nbetween 1999 and 2007 in order to characterize the classic warm absorber (WA)\nusing consistent models and up-to-date photoionization codes and atomic physics\ndatabases and to construct a baseline model that can be used as a template for\nthe WA in the 2013 observations. The WA in NGC 5548 is composed of 6 distinct\nionization phases outflowing in 4 kinematic regimes in the form of a stratified\nwind with several layers intersected by our line of sight. If the changes in\nthe WA are solely due to ionization or recombination processes in response to\nvariations in the ionizing flux among the different observations, we are able\nto estimate lower limits on the density of the WA, finding that the farthest\ncomponents are less dense and have a lower ionization. These limits are used to\nput stringent upper limits on the distance of the WA components from the\ncentral ionizing source, with the lowest ionization phases <50, <20, and <5 pc,\nrespectively, while the intermediately ionized components lie at <3.6 and <2.2\npc from the center, respectively. The highest ionization component is located\nat ~0.6 pc or closer to the AGN central engine. The mass outflow rate summed\nover all WA components is ~0.3 Msun/yr, about six times the nominal accretion\nrate of the source. The total kinetic luminosity injected into the ISM is a\nsmall fraction (~0.03%) of the bolometric luminosity of the source. After\nadding the contribution of the UV absorbers, this value augments to ~0.2% of\nthe bolometric luminosity, well below the minimum amount of energy required by\ncurrent feedback models to regulate galaxy evolution.\n", "  We analyze the spatially resolved (250 pc scales) and integrated\nstar-formation (SF) law in the local luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) IC4687.\nThis is one of the first studies of the SF law on a starburst LIRG at these\nsmall spatial scales. We combined new interferometric ALMA CO(2-1) data with\nexisting HST/NICMOS Pa$\\alpha$ narrow-band imaging and VLT/SINFONI near-IR\nintegral field spectroscopy to obtain accurate extinction corrected SF rate\n(SFR) and cold molecular gas surface densities ($\\Sigma_{gas}$ and\n$\\Sigma_{SFR}$). We find that IC4687 forms stars very efficiently with an\naverage depletion time ($t_{dep}$) of 160 Myr for the individual 250 pc\nregions. This is approximately one order of magnitude shorter than the\n$t_{dep}$ of local normal spirals and also shorter than that of main-sequence\nhigh-z objects, even when we use a Galactic $\\alpha_{CO}$ conversion factor.\nThis result suggests a bimodal SF law in the $\\Sigma_{SFR} \\propto\n\\Sigma_{gas}^{N}$ representation. A universal SF law is recovered if we\nnormalize the $\\Sigma_{gas}$ by the global dynamical time. However, at the\nspatial scales studied here, we find that the SF efficiency (or $t_{dep}$) does\nnot depend on the local dynamical time for this object. Therefore, an\nalternative normalization (e.g., free-fall time) should be found if a universal\nSF law exists at these scales.\n", "  From high resolution (R = 45,000), high signal-to-noise (S/N > 400) spectra\ngathered with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrograph (IGRINS) in the H and\nK photometric bands, we have derived elemental abundances of two bright,\nwell-known metal-poor halo stars: the red giant HD 122563 and the subgiant HD\n140283. Since these stars have metallicities approaching [Fe/H] = -3, their\nabsorption features are generally very weak. Neutral-species lines of Mg, Si, S\nand Ca are detectable, as well as those of the light odd-Z elements Na and Al.\nThe derived IR-based abundances agree with those obtained from\noptical-wavelength spectra. For Mg and Si the abundances from the infrared\ntransitions are improvements to those derived from shorter wavelength data.\nMany useful OH and CO lines can be detected in the IGRINS HD 122563 spectrum,\nfrom which derived O and C abundances are consistent to those obtained from the\ntraditional [O I] and CH features. IGRINS high resolutions H- and K-band\nspectroscopy offers promising ways to determine more reliable abundances for\nadditional metal-poor stars whose optical features are either not detectable,\nor too weak, or are based on lines with analytical difficulties.\n", "  Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) infrared observations\nat 1.1-1.7$\\mu$m probe primarily the H$_2$O absorption band at 1.4$\\mu$m, and\nhas provided low resolution transmission spectra for a wide range of\nexoplanets. We present the application of marginalisation based on Gibson\n(2014) to analyse exoplanet transit lightcurves obtained from HST WFC3, to\nbetter determine important transit parameters such as R$_p$/R$_*$, important\nfor accurate detections of H$_2$O. We approximate the evidence, often referred\nto as the marginal likelihood, for a grid of systematic models using the Akaike\nInformation Criterion (AIC). We then calculate the evidence-based weight\nassigned to each systematic model and use the information from all tested\nmodels to calculate the final marginalised transit parameters for both the\nband-integrated, and spectroscopic lightcurves to construct the transmission\nspectrum. We find that a majority of the highest weight models contain a\ncorrection for a linear trend in time, as well as corrections related to HST\norbital phase. We additionally test the dependence on the shift in spectral\nwavelength position over the course of the observations and find that\nspectroscopic wavelength shifts $\\delta_\\lambda(\\lambda)$, best describe the\nassociated systematic in the spectroscopic lightcurves for most targets, while\nfast scan rate observations of bright targets require an additional level of\nprocessing to produce a robust transmission spectrum. The use of\nmarginalisation allows for transparent interpretation and understanding of the\ninstrument and the impact of each systematic evaluated statistically for each\ndataset, expanding the ability to make true and comprehensive comparisons\nbetween exoplanet atmospheres.\n", "  We use the evolutionary population synthesis method to investigate the\nstatistical properties of the wind-fed neutron star (NS) compact ($P_{\\rm\norb}<10$ days) high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) in our Galaxy, based on\ndifferent spin-down models. We find that the spin-down rate in the supersonic\npropeller phase given \\textbf{by assuming that the surrounding material is\ntreated as forming a quasi-static atmosphere} or \\textbf{by assuming that the\ncharacteristic velocity of matter and the typical Alfv$\\acute{e}$n velocity of\nmaterial in the magnetospheric boundary layer are comparable to the sound speed\nin the external medium} is too low to produce the observed number of compact\nHMXBs. We also find that the models suggested \\textbf{by assuming that the\ninfalling material is ejected with the corotation velocity at the\nmagnetospheric radius when the magnetospheric radius is larger than the\ncorotation radius} and \\textbf{by simple integration of the magnetic torque\nover the magnetosphere} with a larger spin-down rate than that given by\n\\citet{dav81} or \\citet{is75} can predict a reasonable number of observed\nwind-fed NS compact HMXBs. Our calculated results indicate that subsonic\npropeller phase may not exist at all by comparing with the observed particular\ndistributions of wind-fed NS compact HMXBs in the $P_s-P_{orb}$ diagram.\nHowever, the spin-down rate suggested by \\citet{wan85,dai06,jia05} and that\ngiven by \\citet{dav73} both seem reasonable to produce the observed\ndistribution of wind-fed NS compact HMXBs in the $P_s-P_{orb}$ diagram. We\ncannot find which spin-down rate seems more reasonable from our calculations.\n", "  KIC 7177553 was observed by the Kepler satellite to be an eclipsing eccentric\nbinary star system with an 18-day orbital period. Recently, an eclipse timing\nstudy of the Kepler binaries has revealed eclipse timing variations in this\nobject with an amplitude of about 100 sec, and an outer period of 529 days. The\nimplied mass of the third body is that of a superJupiter, but below the mass of\na brown dwarf. We therefore embarked on a radial velocity study of this binary\nto determine its system configuration and to check the hypothesis that it hosts\na giant planet. From the radial velocity measurements, it became immediately\nobvious that the same Kepler target contains another eccentric binary, this one\nwith a 16.5-day orbital period. Direct imaging using adaptive optics reveals\nthat the two binaries are separated by 0.4 arcsec (about 167 AU), and have\nnearly the same magnitude (to within 2%). The close angular proximity of the\ntwo binaries, and very similar Gamma velocities, strongly suggest that KIC\n7177553 is one of the rare SB4 systems consisting of two eccentric binaries\nwhere at least one system is eclipsing. Both systems consist of slowly\nrotating, non-evolved, solar-like stars of comparable masses. From the orbital\nseparation and the small difference in Gamma velocity, we infer that the period\nof the outer orbit most likely lies in the range 1000 to 3000 years. New images\ntaken over the next few years, as well as the high-precision astrometry of the\nGaia satellite mission, will allow us to set much narrower constraints on the\nsystem geometry. Finally, we note that the observed eclipse timing variations\nin the Kepler data cannot be produced by the second binary. Further\nspectroscopic observations on a longer time scale will be required to prove the\nexistence of the massive planet.\n", "  We performed small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements on the\nhelimagnetic spinel compound ZnCr2Se4. The ground state of this material is a\nmulti-domain spin-spiral phase, which undergoes domain selection in a magnetic\nfield and reportedly exhibits a transition to a proposed spin-nematic phase at\nhigher fields. We observed a continuous change in the magnetic structure as a\nfunction of field and temperature, as well as a weak discontinuous jump in the\nspiral pitch across the domain-selection transition upon increasing field. From\nour SANS results we have established the absence of any long-range magnetic\norder in the high-field (spin-nematic) phase. We also found that all the\nobserved phase transitions are surprisingly isotropic with respect to the field\ndirection.\n", "  We resolve a significant fraction of globular clusters (GCs) in NGC 4921, the\nbrightest spiral galaxy in Coma. Also we find a number of extended bright star\nclusters (star complexes) in the spur region of the arms. The latter are much\nbrighter and bluer than those in the normal star-forming region, being as\nmassive as 3x10^5 M_odot. The color distribution of the GCs in this galaxy is\nfound to be bimodal. The turnover magnitudes of the luminosity functions (LF)\nof the blue (metal-poor) GCs (0.70<(V-I)<1.05) in the halo are estimated to be\nV(max) =27.11+-0.09 mag and I(max)=26.21+-0.11 mag. We obtain similar values\nfor NGC 4923, a companion S0 galaxy, and two Coma cD galaxies (NGC 4874 and NGC\n4889). The mean value for the turnover magnitudes of these four galaxies is\nI(max)=26.25+-0.03 mag. Adopting M_I (max) = -8.56+-0.09 mag for the metal-poor\nGCs, we determine the mean distance to the four Coma galaxies, 91+-4 Mpc.\nCombining this and the Coma radial velocity, we derive a value of the Hubble\nconstant, H_0 = 77.9+-3.6 km/s/Mpc. We estimate the GC specific frequency of\nNGC 4921 to be S_N = 1.29+-0.25, close to the values for early-type galaxies.\nThis indicates that NGC 4921 is in the transition phase to S0s.\n", "  Aim: We aim to measure the LyC signal from a sample of sources in the Chandra\ndeep field south. We collect star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) with accurate spectroscopic redshifts, for which Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) coverage and multi-wavelength photometry are available. Method:\nWe selected a sample of about 200 sources at z~3. Taking advantage of HST\nresolution, we applied a careful cleaning procedure and rejected sources\nshowing nearby clumps with different colours, which could be lower-z\ninterlopers. Our clean sample consisted of 86 SFGs (including 19 narrow-band\nselected Lya emitters) and 8 AGN (including 6 detected in X-rays). We measured\nthe LyC flux from aperture photometry in four narrow-band filters covering\nwavelengths below a 912 A rest frame (3.11<z<3.53). We estimated the ratio\nbetween ionizing (LyC flux) and 1400 A non-ionizing emissions for AGN and\ngalaxies. Results: By running population synthesis models, we assume an average\nintrinsic L(1400 A)/L(900 A) ratio of 5 as the representative value for our\nsample. With this value and an average treatment of the lines of sight of the\ninter-galactic medium, we estimate the LyC escape fraction relative to the\nintrinsic value (fesc_rel(LyC)). We do not directly detect ionizing radiation\nfrom any individual SFG, but we are able to set a 1(2)sigma upper limit of\nfesc_rel(LyC)<12(24)%. This result is consistent with other non-detections\npublished in the literature. No meaningful limits can be calculated for the\nsub-sample of Lya emitters. We obtain one significant direct detection for an\nAGN at z=3.46, with fesc_rel(LyC) = (72+/-18)%. Conclusions: Our upper limit on\nfescrel(LyC) implies that the SFGs studied here do not present either the\nphysical properties or the geometric conditions suitable for efficient\nLyC-photon escape.\n", "  The Caltech HIgh-speed Multi-color camERA (CHIMERA) is a new instrument that\nhas been developed for use at the prime focus of the Hale 200-inch telescope.\nSimultaneous optical imaging in two bands is enabled by a dichroic beam\nsplitter centered at 567 nm, with Sloan u' and g' bands available on the blue\narm and Sloan r', i' and z_s' bands available on the red arm. Additional\nnarrow-band filters will also become available as required. An Electron\nMultiplying CCD (EMCCD) detector is employed for both optical channels, each\ncapable of simultaneously delivering sub-electron effective read noise under\nmultiplication gain and frame rates of up to 26 fps full frame (several 1000\nfps windowed), over a fully corrected 5 x 5 arcmin field of view. CHIMERA was\nprimarily developed to enable the characterization of the size distribution of\nsub-km Kuiper Belt Objects via stellar occultation, a science case that\nmotivates the frame-rate, the simultaneous multi-color imaging and the wide\nfield of view of the instrument. In addition, it also has unique capability in\nthe detection of faint near-Earth asteroids and will be used for the monitoring\nof short duration transient and periodic sources, particularly those discovered\nby the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF), and the upcoming Zwicky\nTransient Facility (ZTF).\n", "  We present observations of 12CO J=1-0, 13CO J=1-0, HI, and all four\nground-state transitions of the hydroxyl (OH) radical toward a sharp boundary\nregion of the Taurus molecular cloud. Based on a PDR model that reproduces CO\nand [CI] emission from the same region, we modeled the three OH transitions,\n1612, 1665, 1667 MHz successfully through escape probability non-LTE radiative\ntransfer model calculations. We could not reproduce the 1720 MHz observations,\ndue to un-modeled pumping mechanisms, of which the most likely candidate is a\nC-shock. The abundance of OH and CO-dark molecular gas (DMG) are well\nconstrained. The OH abundance [OH]/[H2] decreases from 8*10-7 to 1*10-7 as Av\nincreases from 0.4 to 2.7 mag, following an empirical law [OH]/[H2]= 1.5 *\n10^{-7} + 9.0 * 10^{-7} * exp(-Av/0.81), which is higher than PDR model\npredictions for low extinction regions by a factor of 80. The overabundance of\nOH at extinctions at or below 1 mag is likely the result of a C-shock. The dark\ngas fraction (DGF, defined as fraction of molecular gas without detectable CO\nemission) decreases from 80% to 20%, following a gaussian profile DGF= 0.90 *\nexp(-( Av -0.79 )/0.71)^2) This trend of the DGF is consistent with our\nunderstanding that the DGF drops at low visual extinction due to\nphotodissociation of H2 and drops at high visual extinction due to CO\nformation. The DGF peaks in the extinction range where H2 has already formed\nand achieved self-shielding but 12CO has not. Two narrow velocity components\nwith a peak-to-peak spacing of ~ 1 km s-1 were clearly identified. Their\nrelative intensity and variation in space and frequency suggest colliding\nstreams or gas flows at the boundary region.\n", "  We present rapidly rising transients discovered by a high-cadence transient\nsurvey with Subaru telescope and Hyper Suprime-Cam. We discovered five\ntransients at z=0.384-0.821 showing the rising rate faster than 1 mag per 1 day\nin the restframe near-ultraviolet wavelengths. The fast rising rate and\nbrightness are the most similar to SN 2010aq and PS1-13arp, for which the\nultraviolet emission within a few days after the shock breakout was detected.\nThe lower limit of the event rate of rapidly rising transients is ~9 % of\ncore-collapse supernova rates, assuming a duration of rapid rise to be 1 day.\nWe show that the light curves of the three faint objects agree with the cooling\nenvelope emission from the explosion of red supergiants. The other two luminous\nobjects are, however, brighter and faster than the cooling envelope emission.\nWe interpret these two objects to be the shock breakout from dense wind with\nthe mass loss rate of ~10^{-3} Msun yr^{-1}, as also proposed for PS1-13arp.\nThis mass loss rate is higher than that typically observed for red supergiants.\nThe event rate of these luminous objects is >~1 % of core-collapse supernova\nrate, and thus, our study implies that more than ~1 % of massive stars can\nexperience an intensive mass loss at a few years before the explosion.\n", "  We present $29\\pm1$ classical Oe stars from RIOTS4, a spatially complete,\nspectroscopic survey of Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) field OB stars. The two\nearliest are O6e stars, and four are earlier than any Milky Way (MW) Oe stars.\nWe also find ten Ope stars, showing He~\\textsc{i} infill and/or emission; five\nappear to be at least as hot as $\\sim$O7.5e stars. The hottest, star 77616,\nshows He~\\textsc{ii} disk emission, suggesting that even the hottest O stars\ncan form decretion disks, and offers observational support for theoretical\npredictions that the hottest, fastest rotators can generate He$^+$-ionizing\natmospheres. Our data also demonstrate that Ope stars correspond to Oe stars\nearlier than O7.5e with strong disk emission. We find that in the SMC, Oe stars\nextend to earlier spectral types than in the MW, and our SMC Oe/O frequency,\n$0.26\\pm0.04$, is much greater than the MW value, $0.03\\pm0.01$. These results\nare consistent with angular momentum transport by stronger winds suppressing\ndecretion disk formation at higher metallicity. In addition, our SMC field Oe\nstar frequency is indistinguishable from that for clusters, which is consistent\nwith the similarity between rotation rates in these environments, and contrary\nto the pattern for MW rotation rates. Thus, our findings strongly support the\nviscous decretion disk model and confirm that Oe stars are the high-mass\nextension of the Be phenomenon. Additionally, we find that Fe~\\textsc{ii}\nemission occurs among Oe stars later than O7.5e with massive disks, and we\nrevise a photometric criterion for identifying Oe stars to $J-[3.6] \\geq 0.1$.\n", "  We show that the exponential growth rate of a bar in a stellar disk is\nsubstantially greater when the disk is embedded in a live halo than in a rigid\none having the same mass distribution. We also find that the vigor of the\ninstability in disk-halo systems varies with the shape of the halo velocity\nellipsoid. Disks in rigid halos that are massive enough to be stable by the\nusual criteria, quickly form bars in isotropic halos and much greater halo mass\nis needed to avoid a strong bar; thus stability criteria derived for disks in\nrigid halos do not apply when the halo is responsive. The study presented here\nis of an idealized family of models with near uniform central rotation and that\nlack an extended halo; we present more realistic models with extended halos in\na companion paper. The puzzle presented by the absence of strong bars in some\ngalaxies having gently rising inner rotation curves is compounded by the\nresults presented here.\n", "  We present a catalog of 166 spectroscopically identified hot subdwarf stars\nfrom LAMOST DR1, 44 of which show the characteristics of cool companions in\ntheir optical spectra. Atmospheric parameters of 122 non-composite spectra\nsubdwarf stars were measured by fitting the profiles of hydrogen (H) and helium\n(He) lines with synthetic spectra from non-LTE model atmospheres. Most of the\nsdB stars scatter near the Extreme Horizontal Branch in the $T_{\\rm\neff}-\\log{g}$ diagram and two well defined groups can be outlined. A clustering\nof He-enriched sdO stars appears near $T_{\\rm eff}=45\\,000$ K and $\\log(g) =\n5.8$. The sdB population separates into several nearly parallel sequences in\nthe $T_{\\rm eff}-{\\rm He}$ abundance diagram with clumps corresponding to those\nin the $T_{\\rm eff}-\\log{g}$ diagram. Over $38\\,000$ K (sdO) stars show\nabundance extremes, they are either He-rich or He-deficient and we observe only\na few stars in the $ -1 < \\log(y) < 0$ abundance range. With increasing\ntemperature these extremes become less prominent and the He abundance\napproaches to $\\log(y)\\sim-0.5$. A unique property of our sample is that it\ncovers a large range in apparent magnitudes and galactic latitudes, therefore\nit contains a mix of stars from different populations and galactic\nenvironments. Our results are consistent with the findings of Hirsch (2009) and\nwe conclude that He-rich and He-deficient sdB stars ($\\log(y) < 1$) probably\norigin from different populations. We also find that most sdO and sdB stars lie\nin a narrow strip in the luminosity and helium abundance plane, which suggests\nthat these atmospheric parameters are correlated.\n", "  Laser ablation of a Near-Earth Object (NEO) on a collision course with Earth\nproduces a cloud of ejecta which exerts a thrust on the NEO, deflecting it from\nits original trajectory. Ablation may be performed from afar by illuminating an\nEarth-targeting asteroid or comet with a stand-off \"DE- STAR\" system consisting\nof a large phased-array laser in Earth orbit. Alternatively, a much smaller\nstand-on \"DE-STARLITE\" system may travel alongside the target, slowly\ndeflecting it from nearby over a long period. This paper presents orbital\nsimulations comparing the effectiveness of both systems across a range of laser\nand NEO parameters. Simulated parameters include magnitude, duration and, for\nthe stand-on system, direction of the thrust, as well as the type, size and\norbital characteristics of the target NEO. These simulations indicate that\ndeflection distance is approximately proportional to the magnitude of thrust\nand to the square of the duration of ablation, and is inversely proportional to\nthe mass. Furthermore, deflection distance shows strong dependence on thrust\ndirection with the optimal direction of thrust varying with the duration of\nlaser activity. As one example, consider a typical 325 m asteroid: beginning 15\nyr in advance, just 2 N of thrust from a ~20 kW stand-on DE-STARLITE system is\nsufficient to deflect the asteroid by 2 R_e. Numerous scenarios are discussed\nas is a practical implementation of such a system consistent with current\nlaunch vehicle capabilities.\n", "  We investigate the nonlocal gravity theory by deriving nonlocal equations of\nmotion using the traditional variation principle in a homogeneous background.\nWe focus on a class of models with a linear nonlocal modification term in the\naction. It is found that the resulting equations of motion contain the advanced\nGreen's function, implying that there is an acausality problem. As a\nconsequence, a divergence arises in the solutions due to contributions from the\nfuture infinity unless the Universe will go back to the radiation dominated era\nor become the Minkowski spacetime in the future. We also discuss the relation\nbetween the original nonlocal equations and its biscalar-tensor representation\nand identify the auxiliary fields with the corresponding original nonlocal\nterms. Finally, we show that the acusality problem cannot be avoided by any\nfunction of nonlocal terms in the action.\n", "  We test the predictions of spectral synthesis models based on seven different\nmassive-star prescriptions against Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS)\nobservations of eight young massive clusters in two local galaxies, NGC 1566\nand NGC 5253, chosen because predictions of all seven models are available at\nthe published galactic metallicities. The high angular resolution, extensive\ncluster inventory and full near-ultraviolet to near-infrared photometric\ncoverage make the LEGUS dataset excellent for this study. We account for both\nstellar and nebular emission in the models and try two different prescriptions\nfor attenuation by dust. From Bayesian fits of model libraries to the\nobservations, we find remarkably low dispersion in the median E(B-V) (~0.03\nmag), stellar masses (~10^4 M_\\odot) and ages (~1 Myr) derived for individual\nclusters using different models, although maximum discrepancies in these\nquantities can reach 0.09 mag and factors of 2.8 and 2.5, respectively. This is\nfor ranges in median properties of 0.05-0.54 mag, 1.8-10x10^4 M_\\odot and\n1.6-40 Myr spanned by the clusters in our sample. In terms of best fit, the\nobservations are slightly better reproduced by models with interacting binaries\nand least well reproduced by models with single rotating stars. Our study\nprovides a first quantitative estimate of the accuracies and uncertainties of\nthe most recent spectral synthesis models of young stellar populations,\ndemonstrates the good progress of models in fitting high-quality observations,\nand highlights the needs for a larger cluster sample and more extensive tests\nof the model parameter space.\n", "  The ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Reticulum 2 (Ret 2) was recently discovered in\nimages obtained by the Dark Energy Survey. We have observed the four brightest\nred giants in Ret 2 at high spectral resolution using the Michigan/Magellan\nFiber System. We present detailed abundances for as many as 20 elements per\nstar, including 12 elements heavier than the Fe group. We confirm previous\ndetection of high levels of r-process material in Ret 2 (mean\n[Eu/Fe]=+1.69+/-0.05) found in three of these stars (mean [Fe/H]=-2.88+/-0.10).\nThe abundances closely match the r-process pattern found in the well-studied\nmetal-poor halo star CS22892-052. Such r-process-enhanced stars have not been\nfound in any other ultra-faint dwarf galaxy, though their existence has been\npredicted by at least one model. The fourth star in Ret 2 ([Fe/H]=-3.42+/-0.20)\ncontains only trace amounts of Sr ([Sr/Fe]=-1.73+/-0.43) and no detectable\nheavier elements. One r-process enhanced star is also enhanced in C (natal\n[C/Fe]=+1.1). This is only the third such star known, which suggests that the\nnucleosynthesis sites leading to C and r-process enhancements are decoupled.\nThe r-process-deficient star is enhanced in Mg ([Mg/Fe]=+0.81+/-0.14), and the\nother three stars show normal levels of alpha-enhancement (mean\n[Mg/Fe]=+0.34+/-0.03). The abundances of other alpha and Fe-group elements\nclosely resemble those in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies and metal-poor halo stars,\nsuggesting that the nucleosynthesis that led to the large r-process\nenhancements either produced no light elements or produced light-element\nabundance signatures indistinguishable from normal supernovae.\n", "  We study the spin-orbit torque (SOT) effective fields in Cr/CoFeAl/MgO and\nRu/CoFeAl/MgO magnetic heterostructures using the adiabatic harmonic Hall\nmeasurement. High-quality perpendicular-magnetic-anisotropy CoFeAl layers were\ngrown on Cr and Ru layers. The magnitudes of the SOT effective fields were\nfound to significantly depend on the underlayer material (Cr or Ru) as well as\ntheir thicknesses. The damping-like longitudinal effective field ({\\Delta}H_L)\nincreases with increasing underlayer thickness for all heterostructures. In\ncontrast, the field-like transverse effective field ({\\Delta}H_T) increases\nwith increasing Ru thickness while it is almost constant or slightly decreases\nwith increasing Cr thickness. The sign of {\\Delta}H_L observed in the\nCr-underlayer devices is opposite from that in the Ru-underlayer devices while\n{\\Delta}H_T shows the same sign with a small magnitude. The opposite directions\nof {\\Delta}HL indicate that the signs of spin Hall angle in Cr and Ru are\nopposite, which are in good agreement with theoretical predictions. These\nresults show sizable contribution from SOT even for elements with small spin\norbit coupling such as 3d Cr and 4d Ru.\n", "  We present oxygen abundance measurements for 74 blue compact dwarf (BCD)\ngalaxies in the redshift range in [0.2, 0.5] using the strong-line method. The\nspectra of these objects are taken using Hectospec on the Multiple Mirror\nTelescope (MMT). More than half of these BCDs had dust attenuation corrected\nusing the Balmer decrement method. For comparison, we also selected a sample of\n2023 local BCDs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) database. Based on the\nlocal and intermediate-z BCD samples, we investigated the cosmic evo- lution of\nthe metallicity, star-formation rate (SFR), and Dn (4000) index. Com- pared\nwith local BCDs, the intermediate-z BCDs had a systematically higher R23 ratio\nbut similar O32 ratio. Interestingly, no significant deviation in the\nmass-metallicity (MZ) relation was found between the intermediate-z and lo- cal\nBCDs. Besides the metallicity, the intermediate-z BCDs also exhibited an SFR\ndistribution that was consistent with local BCDs, suggesting a weak de-\npendence on redshift. The intermediate-z BCDs seemed to be younger than the\nlocal BCDs with lower D4000 index values. The insignificant deviation in the\nmass-metallicity and mass-SFR relations between intermediate-z and local BCDs\nindicates that the relations between the global parameters of low-mass compact\ngalaxies may be universal. These results from low mass compact galaxies could\nbe used to place important observational constraints on galaxy formation and\nevolution models.\n", "  Context: Fast surface conversion between ortho- and para-H2 has been observed\nin laboratory studies, and this mechanism has been proposed to play a role in\nthe control of the ortho-para ratio in the interstellar medium. Observations of\nrotational lines of H2 in Photo-Dissociation Regions (PDRs) have indeed found\nsignificantly lower ortho-para ratios than expected at equilibrium. The\nmechanisms controlling the balance of the ortho-para ratio in the interstellar\nmedium thus remain incompletely understood, while this ratio can affect the\nthermodynamical properties of the gas (equation of state, cooling function).\nAims: We aim to build an accurate model of ortho-para conversion on dust\nsurfaces based on the most recent experimental and theoretical results, and to\nvalidate it by comparison to observations of H2 rotational lines in PDRs.\nMethods: We propose a statistical model of ortho-para conversion on dust grains\nwith fluctuating dust temperatures, based on a master equation approach. This\ncomputation is then coupled to full PDR models and compared to PDR\nobservations. Results: We show that the observations of rotational H2 lines\nindicate a high conversion efficiency on dust grains, and that this high\nefficiency can be accounted for if taking dust temperature fluctuations into\naccount with our statistical model of surface conversion. Simpler models\nneglecting the dust temperature fluctuations do not reach the high efficiency\ndeduced from the observations. Moreover, this high efficiency induced by dust\ntemperature fluctuations is quite insensitive to the values of microphysical\nparameters of the model. Conclusions: Ortho-para conversion on grains is thus\nan efficient mechanism in most astrophysical conditions that can play a\nsignificant role in controlling the ortho-para ratio.\n", "  We report the detection of a double planetary system around the evolved\nintermediate-mass star HD 47366 from precise radial-velocity measurements at\nOkayama Astrophysical Observatory, Xinglong Station, and Australian\nAstronomical Observatory. The star is a K1 giant with a mass of\n1.81+-0.13M_sun, a radius of 7.30+-0.33R_sun, and solar metallicity. The\nplanetary system is composed of two giant planets with minimum mass of\n1.75^{+0.20}_{-0.17}Mjup and 1.86^{+0.16}_{-0.15}Mjup, orbital period of\n363.3^{+2.5}_{-2.4} d and 684.7^{+5.0}_{-4.9} d, and eccentricity of\n0.089^{+0.079}_{-0.060} and 0.278^{+0.067}_{-0.094}, respectively, which are\nderived by a double Keplerian orbital fit to the radial-velocity data. The\nsystem adds to the population of multi-giant-planet systems with relatively\nsmall orbital separations, which are preferentially found around evolved\nintermediate-mass stars. Dynamical stability analysis for the system revealed,\nhowever, that the best-fit orbits are unstable in the case of a prograde\nconfiguration. The system could be stable if the planets were in 2:1\nmean-motion resonance, but this is less likely considering the observed period\nratio and eccentricity. A present possible scenario for the system is that both\nof the planets have nearly circular orbits, namely the eccentricity of the\nouter planet is less than ~0.15, which is just within 1.4sigma of the best-fit\nvalue, or the planets are in a mutually retrograde configuration with a mutual\norbital inclination larger than 160 degree.\n", "  We present the results of a detailed numerical simulation of the\ncircumstellar environment around three exoplanet-hosting stars. A\nstate-of-the-art global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model is considered,\nincluding Alfv\\'en wave dissipation as a self-consistent coronal heating\nmechanism. This paper contains the description of the numerical set-up,\nevaluation procedure, and the simulated coronal structure of each system (HD\n1237, HD 22049 and HD 147513). The simulations are driven by surface magnetic\nfield maps, recovered with the observational technique of Zeeman Doppler\nImaging (ZDI). A detailed comparison of the simulations is performed, where two\ndifferent implementations of this mapping routine are used to generate the\nsurface field distributions. Quantitative and qualitative descriptions of the\ncoronae of these systems are presented, including synthetic high-energy\nemission maps in the Extreme Ultra-Violet (EUV) and Soft X-rays (SXR) ranges.\nUsing the simulation results, we are able to recover similar trends as in\nprevious observational studies, including the relation between the magnetic\nflux and the coronal X-ray emission. Furthermore, for HD 1237 we estimate the\nrotational modulation of the high-energy emission due to the various coronal\nfeatures developed in the simulation. We obtain variations, during a single\nstellar rotation cycle, up to 15\\% for the EUV and SXR ranges. The results\npresented here will be used, in a follow-up paper, to self-consistently\nsimulate the stellar winds and inner astrospheres of these systems.\n", "  We have carried out an extensive multi-wavelength study to investigate the\nstar formation process in the S235 complex. The S235 complex has a sphere-like\nshell appearance at wavelengths longer than 2 $\\mu$m and harbors an O9.5V type\nstar approximately at its center. Near-infrared extinction map traces eight\nsubregions (having A$_{V}$ $>$ 8 mag), and five of them appear to be\ndistributed in an almost regularly spaced manner along the sphere-like shell\nsurrounding the ionized emission. This picture is also supported by the\nintegrated $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO intensity maps and by Bolocam 1.1 mm\ncontinuum emission. The position-velocity analysis of CO reveals an almost\nsemi-ring like structure, suggesting an expanding H\\,{\\sc ii} region. We find\nthat the Bolocam clump masses increase as we move away from the location of the\nionizing star. This correlation is seen only for those clumps which are\ndistributed near the edges of the shell. Photometric analysis reveals 435 young\nstellar objects (YSOs), 59\\% of which are found in clusters. Six subregions\n(including five located near the edges of the shell) are very well correlated\nwith the dust clumps, CO gas, and YSOs. The average values of Mach numbers\nderived using NH$_{3}$ data for three (East~1, East~2, and Central~E) out of\nthese six subregions are 2.9, 2.3, and 2.9, indicating these subregions are\nsupersonic. The molecular outflows are detected in these three subregions,\nfurther confirming the on-going star formation activity. Together, all these\nresults are interpreted as observational evidence of positive feedback of a\nmassive star.\n", "  Graphene on silicon carbide (SiC) has proved to be highly successful in Hall\nconductance quantization for its homogeneity at the centimetre scale. Robust\nJosephson coupling has been measured in co-planar diffusive Al/monololayer\ngraphene/Al junctions. Graphene on SiC substrates is a concrete candidate to\nprovide scalability of hybrid Josephson graphene/superconductor devices, giving\nalso promise of ballistic propagation.\n", "  We report results of the first five observing campaigns for the open stellar\ncluster NGC 7243 in the frame of project Young Exoplanet Transit Initiative\n(YETI). The project focuses on the monitoring of young and nearby stellar\nclusters, with the aim to detect young transiting exoplanets, and to study\nother variability phenomena on time-scales from minutes to years. After five\nobserving campaigns and additional observations during 2013 and 2014, a clear\nand repeating transit-like signal was detected in the light curve of\nJ221550.6+495611. Furthermore, we detected and analysed 37 new eclipsing binary\nstars in the studied region. The best fit parameters and light curves of all\nsystems are given. Finally, we detected and analysed 26 new, presumably\npulsating variable stars in the studied region. The follow-up investigation of\nthese objects, including spectroscopic measurements of the exoplanet candidate,\nis currently planned.\n", "  We investigate the properties of star formation-driven outflows by using a\nlarge spectroscopic sample of ~160,000 local \"normal\" star forming galaxies,\ndrawn from the SDSS, spanning a wide range of star formation rates and stellar\nmasses. The galaxy sample is divided into a fine grid of bins in the M_*-SFR\nparameter space, for each of which we produce a composite spectrum by stacking\ntogether the SDSS spectra of the galaxies contained in that bin. We exploit the\nhigh signal-to-noise of the stacked spectra to study the emergence of faint\nfeatures of optical emission lines that may trace galactic outflows and would\notherwise be too faint to detect in individual galaxy spectra. We adopt a novel\napproach that relies on the comparison between the line-of-sight velocity\ndistribution (LoSVD) of the ionised gas (as traced by the [OIII]5007 and\nHalpha+[NII]6548,6583 emission lines) and the LoSVD of the stars, which are\nused as a reference tracing virial motions. Significant deviations of the gas\nkinematics from the stellar kinematics in the high velocity tail of the LoSVDs\nare interpreted as a signature of outflows. Our results suggest that the\nincidence of ionised outflows increases with SFR and sSFR. The outflow velocity\n(v_out) correlates tightly with the SFR for SFR>1 M_Sun/yr, whereas at lower\nSFRs the dependence of v_out on SFR is nearly flat. The outflow velocity,\nalthough with a much larger scatter, increases also with the stellar velocity\ndispersion, and we infer velocities as high as v_out~(6-8)*sigma_stars.\nStrikingly, we detect the signature of ionised outflows only in galaxies\nlocated above the main sequence (MS) of star forming galaxies in the M_*-SFR\ndiagram, and the incidence of such outflows increases sharply with the offset\nfrom the MS. Our complementary analysis of the stellar kinematics reveals the\npresence of blue asymmetries of a few 10 km/s in the stellar LoSVDs. [abridged]\n", "  Solar flares are sudden flashes of brightness on the Sun and are often\nassociated with coronal mass ejections and solar energetic particles which have\nadverse effects in the near Earth environment. By definition, flares are\nusually referred to bright features resulting from excess emission. Using the\nnewly commissioned 1.6~m New Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory,\nhere we show a striking \"negative\" flare with a narrow, but unambiguous \"dark\"\nmoving front observed in He I 10830 \\AA, which is as narrow as 340 km and is\nassociated with distinct spectral characteristics in H-alpha and Mg II lines.\nTheoretically, such negative contrast in He I 10830 \\AA\\ can be produced under\nspecial circumstances, by nonthermal-electron collisions, or photoionization\nfollowed by recombination. Our discovery, made possible due to unprecedented\nspatial resolution, confirms the presence of the required plasma conditions and\nprovides unique information in understanding the energy release and radiative\ntransfer in astronomical objects.\n", "  In this paper, we construct a new class of topological black hole Lifshitz\nsolutions in the presence of nonlinear exponential electrodynamics for\nEinstein-dilaton gravity. We show that the reality of Lifshitz supporting\nMaxwell matter fields exclude the negative horizon curvature solutions except\nfor the asymptotic AdS case. Calculating the conserved and thermodynamical\nquantities, we obtain a Smarr type formula for the mass and confirm that\nthermodynamics first law is satisfied on the black hole horizon. Afterward, we\nstudy the thermal stability of our solutions and figure out the effects of\ndifferent parameters on the stability of solutions under thermal perturbations.\nNext, we apply the gauge/gravity duality in order to calculate the ratio of\nshear viscosity to entropy for a three-dimensional hydrodynamic system by using\nthe pole method. Furthermore, we study the behavior of holographic conductivity\nfor two-dimensional systems such as graphene. We consider linear Maxwell and\nnonlinear exponential electrodynamics separately and disclose the effect of\nnonlinearity on holographic conductivity. We indicate that holographic\nconductivity vanishes for $z>3$ in the case of nonlinear electrodynamics while\nit does not in the linear Maxwell case. Finally, we solve perturbative\nadditional field equations numerically and plot the behaviors of real and\nimaginary parts of conductivity for asymptotic AdS and Lifshitz cases. We\npresent experimental results match with our numerical ones.\n", "  Morphology is often used to infer the state of relaxation of galaxy clusters.\nThe regularity, symmetry, and degree to which a cluster is centrally\nconcentrated inform quantitative measures of cluster morphology. The Cluster\nLensing and Supernova survey with Hubble Space Telescope (CLASH) used weak and\nstrong lensing to measure the distribution of matter within a sample of 25\nclusters, 20 of which were deemed to be relaxed based on their X-ray morphology\nand alignment of the X-ray emission with the BCG. Towards a quantitative\ncharacterization of this important sample of clusters, we present uniformly\nestimated X-ray morphological statistics for all 25 CLASH clusters. We compare\nX-ray morphologies of CLASH clusters with those identically measured for a\nlarge sample of simulated clusters from the MUSIC-2 simulations, selected by\nmass. We confirm a threshold in X-ray surface brightness concentration of C>0.4\nfor cool-core clusters, where C is the ratio of X-ray emission inside 100\nkpc/h70 compared to inside 500 kpc/h70. We report and compare morphologies of\nthese clusters inferred from Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect (SZE) maps of the hot gas\nand in from projected mass maps based on strong and weak lensing. We find a\nstrong agreement in alignments of the orientation of major axes for the\nlensing, X-ray, and SZE maps of nearly all of the CLASH clusters at radii of\n500 kpc (approximately 0.5R500 for these clusters). We also find a striking\nalignment of clusters shapes at the 500 kpc scale, as measured with X-ray, SZE,\nand lensing, with that of the near-infrared stellar light at 10 kpc scales for\nthe 20 \"relaxed\" clusters. This strong alignment indicates a powerful coupling\nbetween the cluster- and galaxy-scale galaxy formation processes.\n", "  We present the COPS-DIGIT-FOOSH (CDF) Herschel spectroscopy data product\narchive, and related ancillary data products, along with data fidelity\nassessments, and a user-created archive in collaboration with the Herschel-PACS\nand SPIRE ICC groups. Our products include datacubes, contour maps, automated\nline fitting results, and best 1-D spectra products for all protostellar and\ndisk sources observed with PACS in RangeScan mode for two observing programs:\nthe DIGIT Open Time Key Program (KPOT_nevans_1 and SDP_nevans_1; PI: N. Evans),\nand the FOOSH Open Time Program (OT1_jgreen02_2; PI: J. Green). In addition, we\nprovide our best SPIRE-FTS spectroscopic products for the COPS Open Time\nProgram (OT2_jgreen02_6; PI: J. Green) and FOOSH sources. We include details of\ndata processing, descriptions of output products, and tests of their\nreliability for user applications. We identify the parts of the dataset to be\nused with caution. The resulting absolute flux calibration has improved in\nalmost all cases. Compared to previous reductions, the resulting rotational\ntemperatures and numbers of CO molecules have changed substantially in some\nsources. On average, however, the rotational temperatures have not changed\nsubstantially (< 2%), but the number of warm (Trot ~ 300 K) CO molecules has\nincreased by about 18%.\n", "  The identification of galaxies with `overly massive' black holes requires two\nmeasurements: a black hole mass (M_bh) and a host spheroid mass (M_sph,*). Here\nwe provide our measurements for NGC 1277. Our structural decomposition reveals\nthat NGC 1277 is dominated by a `classical' spheroid with a Sersic index n=5.3,\na half-light radius R_e=2.1 kpc, and a stellar mass of 2.7x10^{11} M_sun (using\nM_*/L_V=11.65, Martin-Navarro et al.). This mass is an order of magnitude\ngreater than originally reported. Using the latest (M_bh)-n, (M_bh)-(M_sph,*)\nand (M_bh)-sigma relations, the expected black hole mass is respectively\n(0.57^{+1.29}_{-0.40})x10^9 M_sun, (1.58^{+4.04}_{-1.13})x10^9 M_sun, and\n(2.27^{+4.04}_{-1.44})x10^9 M_sun (using sigma=300 km/s) for which the\n`sphere-of-influence' is 0\".31. Our new kinematical maps obtained from laser\nguide star assisted, adaptive optics on the Keck I Telescope dramatically\nreaffirm the presence of the inner, nearly edge-on, disk seen in this galaxy's\nimage. We also report that this produces a large velocity shear (~400 km/s)\nacross the inner 0\".2 (70 pc) plus elevated values of sqrt{sigma^2+(V_rot)^2}\nacross the inner 3\".8x0\".6 region of the galaxy. Our new multi-Gaussian\nexpansion (MGE) models and Jeans Anisotropic MGE (JAM) analysis struggled to\nmatch this extended component. Our optimal black hole mass, albeit a probable\nupper limit because of the disk, is 1.2x10^9 M_sun (M/L_V=12.3). This is an\norder of magnitude smaller than originally reported and 4 times smaller than\nrecently reported. It gives an M_bh/M_sph,* ratio of 0.45% in agreement with\nthe median (~0.5%) and range (0.1 to 5.0%) observed in non-dwarf, early-type\ngalaxies. This result highlights the need for caution with inner disks.\n", "  Solar microwave type III pair burst is composed of normal and reverse-sloped\n(RS) burst branches with oppositely fast frequency drifts. It is the most\nsensitive signature of the primary energy release and electron accelerations in\nflares. This work reported 11 microwave type III pair events in 9 flares\nobserved by radio spectrometers in China and the Czech Republic at frequency of\n0.80 - 7.60 GHz during 1994 - 2014. These type III pairs occurred in flare\nimpulsive and postflare phases with separate frequency in range of 1.08 - 3.42\nGHz and frequency gap 10 - 1700 MHz. The frequency drift increases with the\nseparate frequency (f_{x}), the lifetime of each burst is anti-correlated to\nf_{x}, while the frequency gap is independent to f_{x}. In most events, the\nnormal branches are drifting obviously faster than the RS branches. The type\nIII pairs occurring in flare impulsive phase have lower separate frequency,\nlonger lifetime, wider frequency gap, and slower frequency drift than that\noccurring in postflare phase. And the latter always has strong circular\npolarization. Further analysis indicates that near the flare energy-release\nsites the plasma density is about 10^{10} - 10^{11},cm^{-3} and temperature\nhigher than 10^{7} K . These results provide new constraints to the\nacceleration mechanism in solar flares.\n", "  We have discovered six radio millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in a search with the\nArecibo telescope of 34 unidentified gamma-ray sources from the Fermi Large\nArea Telescope (LAT) 4-year point source catalog. Among the 34 sources, we also\ndetected two MSPs previously discovered elsewhere. Each source was observed at\na center frequency of 327 MHz, typically at three epochs with individual\nintegration times of 15 minutes. The new MSP spin periods range from 1.99 to\n4.66 ms. Five of the six pulsars are in interacting compact binaries (period <\n8.1 hr), while the sixth is a more typical neutron star-white dwarf binary with\nan 83-day orbital period. This is a higher proportion of interacting binaries\nthan for equivalent Fermi-LAT searches elsewhere. The reason is that Arecibo's\nlarge gain afforded us the opportunity to limit integration times to 15\nminutes, which significantly increased our sensitivity to these highly\naccelerated systems. Seventeen of the remaining 26 gamma-ray sources are still\ncategorized as strong MSP candidates, and will be re-searched.\n", "  We present updated simulations of the detectability of Jupiter analogs by the\n17-year Anglo-Australian Planet Search. The occurrence rate of Jupiter-like\nplanets that have remained near their formation locations beyond the ice line\nis a critical datum necessary to constrain the details of planet formation. It\nis also vital in our quest to fully understand how common (or rare) planetary\nsystems like our own are in the Galaxy. From a sample of 202 solar-type stars,\nand correcting for imperfect detectability on a star-by-star basis, we derive a\nfrequency of $6.2^{+2.8}_{-1.6}$% for giant planets in orbits from 3-7 AU. When\na consistent definition of \"Jupiter analog\" is used, our results are in\nagreement with those from other legacy radial velocity surveys.\n", "  Using a sample of ~6,000 local face-on star-forming galaxies (SFGs), we\nexamine the correlations between the NUV-r colors both inside and outside the\nhalf-light radius, stellar mass M* and S\\'{e}rsic index n in order to\nunderstand how the quenching of star formation is linked to galaxy structure.\nFor these less dust-attenuated galaxies, NUV-r is found to be linearly\ncorrelated with Dn4000, supporting that NUV-r is a good photometric indicator\nof stellar age (or specific star formation rate). We find that: (1) At\nM*<10^{10.2}M_{\\sun}, the central NUV-r is on average only~ 0.25 mag redder\nthan the outer NUV-r. The intrinsic value would be even smaller after\naccounting for dust correction. However, the central NUV-r becomes\nsystematically much redder than the outer NUV-r for more massive galaxies at\nM*>10^{10.2}M_{\\sun}. (2) The central NUV-r shows no dependence on S\\'{e}rsic\nindex n at M*<10^{10.2}M_{\\sun}, while above this mass galaxies with a higher n\ntend to be redder in the central NUV-r color. These results suggest that\ngalaxies with M*<10^{10.2}M_{\\sun} exhibit similar star formation activity from\nthe inner R<R_{50} region to the R>R_{50} region. In contrast, a considerable\nfraction of the M*>10^{10.2}M_{\\sun} galaxies, especially those with a high n,\nhave harbored a relatively inactive bulge component.\n", "  The NASA Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) has discovered almost all\nthe known members of the new class of Y-type brown dwarfs. Most of these Y\ndwarfs have been identified as isolated objects in the field. It is known that\nbinaries with L- and T-type brown dwarf primaries are less prevalent than\neither M-dwarf or solar-type primaries, they tend to have smaller separations\nand are more frequently detected in near-equal mass configurations. The binary\nstatistics for Y-type brown dwarfs, however, are sparse, and so it is unclear\nif the same trends that hold for L- and T-type brown dwarfs also hold for\nY-type ones. In addition, the detection of binary companions to very cool Y\ndwarfs may well be the best means available for discovering even colder\nobjects. We present results for binary properties of a sample of five WISE Y\ndwarfs with the Gemini Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics System (GeMS). We find\nno evidence for binary companions in these data, which suggests these systems\nare not equal-luminosity (or equal-mass) binaries with separations larger than\n~ 0.5-1.9 AU. For equal-mass binaries at an age of 5 Gyr, we find that the\nbinary binding energies ruled out by our observations (i.e. 10^42 erg) are\nconsistent with those observed in previous studies of hotter ultra-cool dwarfs.\n", "  The zodiacal emission, which is the thermal infrared (IR) emission from the\ninterplanetary dust (IPD) in our Solar System, has been studied for a long\ntime. Nevertheless, accurate modeling of the zodiacal emission has not been\nsuccessful to reproduce the all-sky spatial distribution of the zodiacal\nemission, especially in the mid-IR where the zodiacal emission peaks. We\ntherefore aim to improve the IPD cloud model based on Kelsall et al. 1998,\nusing the AKARI 9 and 18 micron all-sky diffuse maps. By adopting a new fitting\nmethod based on the total brightness, we have succeeded in reducing the\nresidual levels after subtraction of the zodiacal emission from the AKARI data\nand thus in improving the modeling of the zodiacal emission. Comparing the\nAKARI and the COBE data, we confirm that the changes from the previous model to\nour new model are mostly due to model improvements, but not temporal variations\nbetween the AKARI and the COBE epoch, except for the position of the\nEarth-trailing blob. Our results suggest that the size of the smooth cloud, a\ndominant component in the model, is by about 10% more compact than previously\nthought, and that the dust sizes are not large enough to emit blackbody\nradiation in the mid-IR. Furthermore we significantly detect an\nisotropically-distributed IPD component, owing to accurate baseline measurement\nwith AKARI.\n", "  A number of mechanisms to understand the periodic class II methanol masers\nassociated with some high-mass star forming regions have been proposed in the\npast. Two recent proposals, ie. by Parfenov &Sobolev (2014) and Sanna et al.\n(2015) have been presented in order to explain the periodic masers in sources\nwith light curves similar to the methanol masers in G9.62+0.20E. We evaluate to\nwhat extent the proposals and models presented by these authors can explain the\nlight curve of the methanol masers in G9.62+0.20E. It is argued that neither of\nthe proposed mechanisms can reproduce the light curves of the methanol masers\nin G9.62+0.20E.\n", "  The Sun is the only star whose surface can be directly resolved at high\nresolution, and therefore constitutes an excellent test case to explore the\nphysical origin of stellar radial-velocity (RV) variability. We present HARPS\nobservations of sunlight scattered off the bright asteroid 4/Vesta, from which\nwe deduced the Sun's activity-driven RV variations. In parallel, the HMI\ninstrument onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory provided us with simultaneous\nhigh spatial resolution magnetograms, Dopplergrams, and continuum images of the\nSun in the Fe I 6173A line. We determine the RV modulation arising from the\nsuppression of granular blueshift in magnetised regions and the flux imbalance\ninduced by dark spots and bright faculae. The rms velocity amplitudes of these\ncontributions are 2.40 m/s and 0.41 m/s, respectively, which confirms that the\ninhibition of convection is the dominant source of activity-induced RV\nvariations at play, in accordance with previous studies. We find the Doppler\nimbalances of spot and plage regions to be only weakly anticorrelated.\nLightcurves can thus only give incomplete predictions of convective blueshift\nsuppression. We must instead seek proxies that track the plage coverage on the\nvisible stellar hemisphere directly. The chromospheric flux index R'_HK derived\nfrom the HARPS spectra performs poorly in this respect, possibly because of the\ndifferences in limb brightening/darkening in the chromosphere and photosphere.\nWe also find that the activity-driven RV variations of the Sun are strongly\ncorrelated with its full-disc magnetic flux density, which may become a useful\nproxy for activity-related RV noise.\n", "  We discuss how the redshift (Mattig) method in Friedmann cosmology relates to\ndynamical distance indicators based on Newton's gravity (Teerikorpi 2011). It\nbelongs to the class of indicators where the relevant length inside the system\nis the distance itself (in this case the proper metric distance). As the\nFriedmann model has Newtonian analogy, its use to infer distances has\ninstructive similarities to classical dynamical distance indicators. In view of\nthe theoretical exact linear distance-velocity law, we emphasize that it is\nconceptually correct to derive the cosmological distance via the route:\nredshift (primarily observed) --> space expansion velocity (not directly\nobserved) --> metric distance (physical length in \"cm\"). Important properties\nof the proper metric distance are summarized.\n", "  We report the detection of a heavily obscured Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN)\nin the luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) NGC 6286, identified in a 17.5 ks NuSTAR\nobservation. The source is in an early merging stage, and was targeted as part\nof our ongoing NuSTAR campaign observing local luminous and ultra-luminous\ninfrared galaxies in different merger stages. NGC 6286 is clearly detected\nabove 10 keV and, by including the quasi-simultaneous Swift/XRT and archival\nXMM-Newton and Chandra data, we find that the source is heavily obscured\n[$N_{\\rm\\,H}\\simeq (0.95-1.32)\\times 10^{24}\\rm\\,cm^{-2}$], with a column\ndensity consistent with being Compton-thick [CT, $\\log (N_{\\rm\\,H}/\\rm\ncm^{-2})\\geq 24$]. The AGN in NGC 6286 has a low absorption-corrected\nluminosity ($L_{2-10\\rm\\,keV}\\sim 3-20\\times 10^{41}\\rm\\,erg\\,s^{-1}$) and\ncontributes $\\lesssim$1\\% to the energetics of the system. Because of its\nlow-luminosity, previous observations carried out in the soft X-ray band ($<10$\nkeV) and in the infrared did not notice the presence of a buried AGN. NGC 6286\nhas multi-wavelength characteristics typical of objects with the same infrared\nluminosity and in the same merger stage, which might imply that there is a\nsignificant population of obscured low-luminosity AGN in LIRGs that can only be\ndetected by sensitive hard X-ray observations.\n", "  Inverse Compton cooling limits the brightness temperature of the radiating\nplasma to a maximum of $10^{11.5}$ K. Relativistic boosting can increase its\nobserved value, but apparent brightness temperatures much in excess of\n$10^{13}$ K are inaccessible using ground-based very long baseline\ninterferometry (VLBI) at any wavelength. We present observations of the quasar\n3C273, made with the space VLBI mission RadioAstron on baselines up to 171,000\nkm, which directly reveal the presence of angular structure as small as 26\n$\\mu$as (2.7 light months) and brightness temperature in excess of $10^{13}$ K.\nThese measurements challenge our understanding of the non-thermal continuum\nemission in the vicinity of supermassive black holes and require a much higher\nDoppler factor than what is determined from jet apparent kinematics.\n", "  Earth-space interferometry with RadioAstron provides the highest direct\nangular resolution ever achieved in astronomy at any wavelength. RadioAstron\ndetections of the classic quasar 3C273 on interferometric baselines up to\n171,000 km suggest brightness temperatures exceeding expected limits from the\n\"inverse-Compton catastrophe\" by two orders of magnitude. We show that at 18\ncm, these estimates most probably arise from refractive substructure introduced\nby scattering in the interstellar medium. We use the scattering properties to\nestimate an intrinsic brightness temperature of 7*10^12 K, which is consistent\nwith expected theoretical limits, but which is ~15 times lower than estimates\nthat neglect substructure. At 6.2 cm, the substructure influences the measured\nvalues appreciably but gives an estimated brightness temperature that is\ncomparable to models that do not account for the substructure. At 1.35 cm, the\nsubstructure does not affect the extremely high inferred brightness\ntemperatures, in excess of 10^13 K. We also demonstrate that for a source\nhaving a Gaussian surface brightness profile, a single long-baseline estimate\nof refractive substructure determines an absolute minimum brightness\ntemperature, if the scattering properties along a given line of sight are\nknown, and that this minimum accurately approximates the apparent brightness\ntemperature over a wide range of total flux densities.\n", "  The Boolardy Engineering Test Array is a 6 x 12 m dish interferometer and the\nprototype of the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), equipped\nwith the first generation of ASKAP's phased array feed (PAF) receivers. These\nfacilitate rapid wide-area imaging via the deployment of simultaneous multiple\nbeams within a 30 square degree field of view. By cycling the array through 12\ninterleaved pointing positions and using 9 digitally formed beams we\neffectively mimic a traditional 1 hour x 108 pointing survey, covering 150\nsquare degrees over 711 - 1015 MHz in 12 hours of observing time. Three such\nobservations were executed over the course of a week. We verify the full\nbandwidth continuum imaging performance and stability of the system via\nself-consistency checks and comparisons to existing radio data. The combined\nthree epoch image has arcminute resolution and a 1-sigma thermal noise level of\n375 micro-Jy per beam, although the effective noise is a factor 3 higher due to\nresidual sidelobe confusion. From this we derive a catalogue of 3,722 discrete\nradio components, using the 35 percent fractional bandwidth to measure in-band\nspectral indices for 1,037 of them. A search for transient events reveals one\nsignificantly variable source within the survey area. The survey covers\napproximately two-thirds of the Spitzer South Pole Telescope Deep Field. This\npilot project demonstrates the viability and potential of using PAFs to rapidly\nand accurately survey the sky at radio wavelengths.\n", "  We investigate morphological properties of 61 Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) at\nz = 4.86 identified in the COSMOS field, based on Hubble Space Telescope\nAdvanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) imaging data in the F814W-band. Out of the 61\nLAEs, we find the ACS counterparts for the 54 LAEs. Eight LAEs show\ndouble-component structures with a mean projected separation of 0.\"63 (~ 4.0\nkpc at z = 4.86). Considering the faintness of these ACS sources, we carefully\nevaluate their morphological properties, that is, size and ellipticity. While\nsome of them are compact and indistinguishable from the PSF half-light radius\nof 0.\"07 (~ 0.45 kpc), the others are clearly larger than the PSF size and\nspatially extended up to 0.\"3 (~ 1.9 kpc). We find that the ACS sources show a\npositive correlation between ellipticity and size and that the ACS sources with\nlarge size and round shape are absent. Our Monte Carlo simulation suggests that\nthe correlation can be explained by (1) the deformation effects via PSF\nbroadening and shot noise or (2) the source blending in which two or more\nsources with small separation are blended in our ACS image and detected as a\nsingle elongated source. Therefore, the 46 single-component LAEs could contain\nthe sources which consist of double (or multiple) components with small spatial\nseparation (i.e., < 0.\"3 or 1.9 kpc). Further observation with high angular\nresolution at longer wavelengths (e.g., rest-frame wavelengths of > 4000 A) is\ninevitable to decipher which interpretation is adequate for our LAE sample.\n", "  By comparing photon diffusion time with gas outflow time, I argue that a\nlarge fraction of the energy carried by the jets during the grazing envelope\nevolution (GEE) might end in radiation, hence leading to an intermediate\nluminosity optical transient (ILOT). In the GEE a companion orbiting near the\noutskirts of the larger primary star accretes mass through an accretion disk,\nand launches jets that efficiently remove the envelope gas from the vicinity of\nthe secondary star. In cases of high mass accretion rates onto the stellar\ncompanion the energy carried by the jets surpass the recombination energy from\nthe ejected mass, and when the primary star is a giant this energy surpasses\nalso the gravitational binding energy of the binary system. Some future ILOTs\nof giant stars might be better explained by the GEE than by merger and common\nenvelope evolution without jets.\n", "  We present deep LOFAR observations between 120-181 MHz of the \"Toothbrush\"\n(RX J0603.3+4214), a cluster that contains one of the brightest radio relic\nsources known. Our LOFAR observations exploit a new and novel calibration\nscheme to probe 10 times deeper than any previous study in this relatively\nunexplored part of the spectrum. The LOFAR observations, when combined with\nVLA, GMRT, and Chandra X-ray data, provide new information about the nature of\ncluster merger shocks and their role in re-accelerating relativistic particles.\nWe derive a spectral index of $\\alpha = -0.8 \\pm 0.1$ at the northern edge of\nthe main radio relic, steepening towards the south to $\\alpha \\approx - 2$. The\nspectral index of the radio halo is remarkably uniform ($\\alpha = -1.16$, with\nan intrinsic scatter of $\\leq 0.04$). The observed radio relic spectral index\ngives a Mach number of $\\mathcal{M} = 2.8^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$, assuming diffusive\nshock acceleration (DSA). However, the gas density jump at the northern edge of\nthe large radio relic implies a much weaker shock ($\\mathcal{M} \\approx 1.2$,\nwith an upper limit of $\\mathcal{M} \\approx 1.5$). The discrepancy between the\nMach numbers calculated from the radio and X-rays can be explained if either\n(i) the relic traces a complex shock surface along the line of sight, or (ii)\nif the radio relic emission is produced by a re-accelerated population of\nfossil particles from a radio galaxy. Our results highlight the need for\nadditional theoretical work and numerical simulations of particle acceleration\nand re-acceleration at cluster merger shocks.\n", "  Determining which small exoplanets have stony-iron compositions is necessary\nfor quantifying the occurrence of such planets and for understanding the\nphysics of planet formation. Kepler-10 hosts the stony-iron world Kepler-10b\n(K10b), and also contains what has been reported to be the largest solid\nsilicate-ice planet, Kepler-10c (K10c). Using 220 radial velocities (RVs),\nincluding 72 precise RVs from Keck-HIRES of which 20 are new from 2014-2015,\nand 17 quarters of Kepler photometry, we obtain the most complete picture of\nthe Kepler-10 system to date. We find that K10b (Rp=1.47 Re) has mass\n3.72$\\pm$0.42 Me and density 6.46$\\pm$0.73 g/cc. Modeling the interior of K10b\nas an iron core overlaid with a silicate mantle, we find that the iron core\nconstitutes 0.17$\\pm$0.11 of the planet mass. For K10c (Rp=2.35 Re) we measure\nMp=13.98$\\pm$1.79 Me and $\\rho$=5.94$\\pm$0.76 g/cc, significantly lower than\nthe mass computed in Dumusque et al. (2014, 17.2$\\pm$1.9 Me). Internal\ncompositional modeling reveals that at least $10\\%$ of the radius of Kepler-10c\nis a volatile envelope composed of hydrogen-helium ($0.2\\%$ of the mass, $16\\%$\nof the radius) or super-ionic water ($28\\%$ of the mass, $29\\%$ of the radius).\nAnalysis of only HIRES data yields a higher mass for K10b and a lower mass for\nK10c than does analysis of the HARPS-N data alone, with the mass estimates for\nK10c formally inconsistent by 3$\\sigma$. Splitting the RVs from each instrument\nleads to inconsistent measurements for the mass of planet c in each data set.\nThis suggests that time-correlated noise is present and that the uncertainties\nin the planet masses (especially K10c) exceed our formal estimates. Transit\ntiming variations (TTVs) of K10c indicate the likely presence of a third planet\nin the system, KOI-72.X. The TTVs and RVs are consistent with KOI-72.X having\nan orbital period of 24, 71, or 101 days, and a mass from 1-7 Me.\n", "  In this paper we present observations, simulations, and analysis\ndemonstrating the direct connection between the location of foreground emission\non the sky and its location in cosmological power spectra from interferometric\nredshifted 21 cm experiments. We begin with a heuristic formalism for\nunderstanding the mapping of sky coordinates into the cylindrically averaged\npower spectra measurements used by 21 cm experiments, with a focus on the\neffects of the instrument beam response and the associated sidelobes. We then\ndemonstrate this mapping by analyzing power spectra with both simulated and\nobserved data from the Murchison Widefield Array. We find that removing a\nforeground model which includes sources in both the main field-of-view and the\nfirst sidelobes reduces the contamination in high k_parallel modes by several\npercent relative to a model which only includes sources in the main\nfield-of-view, with the completeness of the foreground model setting the\nprincipal limitation on the amount of power removed. While small, a\npercent-level amount of foreground power is in itself more than enough to\nprevent recovery of any EoR signal from these modes. This result demonstrates\nthat foreground subtraction for redshifted 21 cm experiments is truly a\nwide-field problem, and algorithms and simulations must extend beyond the main\ninstrument field-of-view to potentially recover the full 21 cm power spectrum.\n", "  In the simplest Higgs-portal scalar dark matter model, the dark matter mass\nhas been restricted to be either near the resonant mass ($m_h/2$) or in a\nlarge-mass region by the direct detection at LHC Run 1 and LUX. While the\nlarge-mass region below roughly 3 TeV can be probed by the future Xenon1T\nexperiment, most of the resonant mass region is beyond the scope of Xenon1T. In\nthis paper, we study the direct detection of such scalar dark matter in the\nnarrow resonant mass region at the 14 TeV LHC and the future 100 TeV hadron\ncollider. We show the luminosities required for the $2\\sigma$ exclusion and\n$5\\sigma$ discovery.\n", "  We studied two objects identified as a Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) with\nperiods exceeding the natural boundary for Roche lobe filling ZAMS secondary\nstars. We present observational results for V1082 Sgr with 20.82 h orbital\nperiod, an object that shows low luminosity state, when its flux is totally\ndominated by a chromospherically active K- star with no signs of ongoing\naccretion. Frequent accretion shut-offs, together with characteristics of\nemission lines in a high state, indicate that this binary system is probably\ndetached and the accretion of matter on the magnetic white dwarf takes place\nthrough stellar wind from the active donor star via coupled magnetic fields.\nIts observational characteristics are surprisingly similar to V479 And, a 14.5\nh binary system. They both have early K-type stars as a donor star. We argue,\nthat similar to the shorter period pre-polars containing M-dwarfs, these are\ndetached binaries with strong magnetic components. Their magnetic fields are\ncoupled, allowing enhanced stellar wind from the K star to be captured and\nchanneled through the bottleneck connecting the two stars onto the white\ndwarf's magnetic pole, mimicking a magnetic CV. Hence, they become interactive\nbinaries before they reach contact. This will help to explain an unexpected\nlack of systems possessing white dwarfs with strong magnetic fields among\ndetached white + red dwarf systems.\n", "  We conducted observations of 12CO(J=5-4) and dust thermal continuum emission\ntoward twenty star-forming galaxies on the main sequence at z~1.4 using ALMA to\ninvestigate the properties of the interstellar medium. The sample galaxies are\nchosen to trace the distributions of star-forming galaxies in diagrams of\nstellar mass-star formation rate and stellar mass-metallicity. We detected CO\nemission lines from eleven galaxies. The molecular gas mass is derived by\nadopting a metallicity-dependent CO-to-H2 conversion factor and assuming a\nCO(5-4)/CO(1-0) luminosity ratio of 0.23. Molecular gas masses and its\nfractions (molecular gas mass/(molecular gas mass + stellar mass)) for the\ndetected galaxies are in the ranges of (3.9-12) x 10^{10} Msun and 0.25-0.94,\nrespectively; these values are significantly larger than those in local spiral\ngalaxies. The molecular gas mass fraction decreases with increasing stellar\nmass; the relation holds for four times lower stellar mass than that covered in\nprevious studies, and that the molecular gas mass fraction decreases with\nincreasing metallicity. Stacking analyses also show the same trends. The dust\nthermal emissions were clearly detected from two galaxies and marginally\ndetected from five galaxies. Dust masses of the detected galaxies are (3.9-38)\nx 10^{7} Msun. We derived gas-to-dust ratios and found they are 3-4 times\nlarger than those in local galaxies. The depletion times of molecular gas for\nthe detected galaxies are (1.4-36) x 10^{8} yr while the results of the\nstacking analysis show ~3 x 10^{8} yr. The depletion time tends to decrease\nwith increasing stellar mass and metallicity though the trend is not so\nsignificant, which contrasts with the trends in local galaxies.\n", "  I present the first substantial work to measure the fraction of debris disks\nfor M-dwarfs in nearby moving groups (MGs). Utilising the $AllWISE$ IR catalog,\n17 out of 151 MG members are found with an IR photometric excess indicative of\ndisk structure. The M-dwarf debris disk fraction is $\\lesssim 6$ per cent in\nMGs younger than 40\\,Myr, and none are found in the groups older than 40\\,Myr.\nSimulations show, however, that debris disks around M-dwarfs are not present\nabove a $WISE$ $W1-W4$ colour of $\\sim 2.5$, making calculating the absolute\ndisk fractions difficult. The debris disk dissipation timescale appears to be\nfaster than for higher-mass stars, and mechanisms such as enhanced stellar wind\ndrag and/or photoevaporation could account for the more rapid decline of disks\nobserved amongst M-dwarfs.\n", "  Deuterium-to-hydrogen (D/H) enrichments in molecular species provide clues\nabout their original formation environment. The organic materials in primitive\nsolar system bodies have generally higher D/H ratios and show greater D/H\nvariation when compared to D/H in solar system water. We propose this\ndifference arises at least in part due to 1) the availability of additional\nchemical fractionation pathways for organics beyond that for water, and 2) the\nhigher volatility of key carbon reservoirs compared to oxygen. We test this\nhypothesis using detailed disk models, including a sophisticated, new disk\nionization treatment with a low cosmic ray ionization rate, and find that disk\nchemistry leads to higher deuterium enrichment in organics compared to water,\nhelped especially by fractionation via the precursors CH$_2$D$^+$/CH$_3^+$. We\nalso find that the D/H ratio in individual species varies significantly\ndepending on their particular formation pathways. For example, from $\\sim20-40$\nAU, CH$_4$ can reach $\\rm{D/H\\sim2\\times10^{-3}}$, while D/H in CH$_3$OH\nremains locally unaltered. Finally, while the global organic D/H in our models\ncan reproduce intermediately elevated D/H in the bulk hydrocarbon reservoir,\nour models are unable to reproduce the most deuterium-enriched organic\nmaterials in the solar system, and thus our model requires some inheritance\nfrom the cold interstellar medium from which the Sun formed.\n", "  Stellar activity can induce signals in the radial velocities of stars,\ncomplicating the detection of orbiting low-mass planets. We present a method to\ndetermine the number of planetary signals present in radial-velocity datasets\nof active stars, using only radial-velocity observations. Instead of\nconsidering separate fits with different number of planets, we use a\nbirth-death Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to infer the posterior\ndistribution for the number of planets in a single run. In a natural way, the\nmarginal distributions for the orbital parameters of all planets are also\ninferred. This method is applied to HARPS data of CoRoT-7. We confidently\nrecover both CoRoT-7b and CoRoT-7c although the data show evidence for\nadditional signals.\n", "  Segmented strings in flat space are piecewise linear classical string\nsolutions. Kinks between the segments move with the speed of light and their\nworldlines form a lattice on the worldsheet. This idea can be generalized to\nAdS$_3$ where the embedding is built from AdS$_2$ patches. The construction\nprovides an exact discretization of the non-linear string equations of motion.\n  This paper computes the area of segmented strings using cross-ratios\nconstructed from the kink vectors. The cross-ratios can be expressed in terms\nof either left-handed or right-handed variables. The string equation of motion\nin AdS$_3$ is reduced to that of an integrable time-discretized relativistic\nToda-type lattice. Positive solutions yield string embeddings that are unique\nup to global transformations. In the appendix, the Poincare target space energy\nis computed by integrating the worldsheet current along kink worldlines and a\nformula is derived for the integrated scalar curvature of the embedding.\n", "  We analyze a recently proposed temporal centrality measure applied to an\nempirical network based on person-to-person contacts in an emergency department\nof a busy urban hospital. We show that temporal centrality identifies a\ndistinct set of top-spreaders than centrality based on the time-aggregated\nbinarized contact matrix, so that taken together, the accuracy of capturing\ntop-spreaders improves significantly. However, with respect to predicting\nepidemic outcome, the temporal measure does not necessarily outperform less\ncomplex measures. Our results also show that other temporal markers such as\nduration observed and the time of first appearance in the the network can be\nused in a simple predictive model to generate predictions that capture the\ntrend of the observed data remarkably well.\n", "  Quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) detected in the X-ray radiation of black\nhole X-ray binaries (BHXBs) is thought to originate from dynamical processes in\nthe close vicinity of the black holes (BHs), and thus carries important\nphysical information therein. Such a feature is extremely rare in active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs) with supermassive BHs. Here we report on the detection\nof a possible X-ray QPO signal with a period of 3800\\,s at a confidence level\n$>99.99\\%$ in the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy (NLS1) 1H~0707-495 in one data\nset in 0.2-10\\,keV taken with {\\it XMM-Newton}. The statistical significance is\nhigher than that of most previously reported QPOs in AGNs. The QPO is highly\ncoherent (quality factor $Q=\\nu/\\Delta\\nu \\geqslant 15$) with a high rms\nfractional variability ($\\sim15\\%$). A comprehensive analysis of the optical\nspectra of this AGN is also performed, yielding a central BH mass\n$5.2\\times10^6\\,M_{\\odot}$ from the broad emission lines based on the scaling\nrelation. The QPO follows closely the known frequency-BH mass relation, which\nspans from stellar-mass to supermassive BHs. The absence of the QPO in other\nobservations of the object suggests it a transient phenomenon. We suggest that\nthe (high-frequency) QPOs tend to occur in highly accreting BH systems, from\nBHXBs to supermassive BHs. Future precise estimation of the BH mass may be used\nto infer the BH spin from the QPO frequency.\n", "  We present a sample of resolved galactic HII regions and photodissociation\nregions (PDRs) observed with the Spitzer infrared spectrograph (IRS) in\nspectral mapping mode between the wavelengths of 5--15 $\\mu$m. For each object\nwe have spectral maps at a spatial resolution of $\\sim$4\" in which we have\nmeasured all of the mid-infrared emission and absorption features. These\ninclude the PAH emission bands, primarily at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.2 and 12.7\n$\\mu$m, as well as the spectral emission lines of neon and sulfur and the\nabsorption band caused by silicate dust at around 9.8 $\\mu$m. In this work we\ndescribe the data in detail, including the data reduction and measurement\nstrategies, and subsequently present the PAH emission band intensity\ncorrelations for each of the objects and the sample as a whole. We find that\nthere are distinct differences between the sources in the sample, with two main\ngroups, the first comprising the HII regions and the second the reflection\nnebulae (RNe). Three sources, the reflection nebula NGC~7023, the Horsehead\nnebula PDR (an interface between the HII region IC~434 and the Orion B\nmolecular cloud) and M 17, resist this categorization, with the Horsehead PDR\npoints mimicking the RNe and the NGC~7023 fluxes displaying unique bifurcated\nappearance in our correlation plots. These discrepancies seem to be due to the\nvery low radiation field experienced by the Horsehead PDR and the very clean\nseparation between the PDR environment and a diffuse environment in the\nNGC~7023 observations.\n", "  Mass and momentum exchanges in close massive binaries play an important role\nin their evolution, and produce several observational signatures such as\nasynchronous rotation and altered chemical compositions, that remain after the\nstars detach again. We investigated these effects for the detached massive\nO-star binary HD 149404 (O7.5If + ON9.7I, P = 9.81 days), which is thought to\nhave experienced a past episode of case A Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF). Using\nphase-resolved spectroscopy, we performed the disentangling of the optical\nspectra of the two stars. The reconstructed primary and secondary spectra were\nthen analysed with the CMFGEN model atmosphere code to determine stellar\nparameters, such as the effective temperatures and surface gravities, and to\nconstrain the chemical composition of the components. We complemented the\noptical study with the study of IUE spectra, which we compare to the synthetic\nbinary spectra. The properties of the stars were compared to evolutionary\nmodels. We confirmed a strong overabundance in nitrogen ($\\left[\\rm\nN/C\\right]\\sim150\\left[\\rm N/C\\right]_{\\odot}$) for the secondary and a slight\nnitrogen overabundance ($\\left[\\rm N/C\\right]\\sim5\\left[\\rm\nN/C\\right]_{\\odot}$) for the primary star. Comparing the two stars, we found\nevidence for asynchronous rotation, with a rotational period ratio of $0.50 \\pm\n0.11$. The hypothesis of a past case A RLOF interaction in HD 149404 is most\nplausible to explain its chemical abundances and rotational asynchronicity.\nSome of the observed properties, such as the abundance pattern, are clearly a\nchallenge for current case A binary evolution models, however.\n", "  Measuring stellar velocity dispersions of quiescent galaxies beyond $z\\sim2$\nis observationally challenging. Such measurements require near-infrared spectra\nwith a continuum detection of at least moderate signal-to-noise, often\nnecessitating long integrations. In this paper, we present deep X-Shooter\nspectroscopy of one of only two known gravitationally-lensed massive quiescent\ngalaxies at $z>2$. This galaxy is quadruply imaged, with the brightest images\nmagnified by a factor of $\\sim5$. The total exposure time of our data is 9.8\nhours on-source; however the magnification, and the slit placement encompassing\n2 images, provides a total equivalent exposure time of 215 hours. From this\ndeep spectrum we measure a redshift ($z_{\\mathrm{spec}}=2.756\\pm0.001$), making\nthis one of the highest redshift quiescent galaxies that is spectroscopically\nconfirmed. We simultaneously fit both the spectroscopic and photometric data to\ndetermine stellar population parameters and conclude this galaxy is relatively\nyoung, intermediate-mass, consistent with low dust content, and has quenched\nonly relatively recently. This recent quenching is confirmed by strong Balmer\nabsorption, particularly $H\\delta$. Remarkably, this proves that at least some\nintermediate-mass galaxies have already quenched as early as $z\\sim2.8$.\nAdditionally, we have measured a velocity dispersion\n($\\sigma=187\\pm43~\\mathrm{km/s}$), making this the highest-redshift quiescent\ngalaxy with a dispersion measurement. We confirm that this galaxy falls on the\nsame mass fundamental plane (MFP) as galaxies at z=2.2, consistent with little\nto no evolution in the MFP up to z=2.8. Overall this galaxy is proof of\nexistence of intermediate-mass quenched galaxies in the distant universe, and\nthat lensing is a powerful tool for determining their properties with improved\naccuracy.\n", "  We use helioseismic holography to study the association of shallow flows with\nsolar flare activity in about 250 large sunspot groups observed between 2010\nand 2014 with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory. Four basic flow parameters: horizontal speed, horizontal component\nof divergence, vertical component of vorticity, and a vertical kinetic helicity\nproxy, are mapped for each active region during its passage across the solar\ndisk. Flow indices are derived representing the mean and standard deviation of\nthese parameters over magnetic masks and compared with contemporary measures of\nflare X-ray flux. A correlation exists for several of the flow indices,\nespecially those based on the speed and the standard deviation of all flow\nparameters. However, their correlation with X-ray flux is similar to that\nobserved with the mean unsigned magnetic flux density over the same masks. The\ntemporal variation of the flow indices are studied, and a superposed epoch\nanalysis with respect to the occurrence to 70 M and X-class flares is made.\nWhile flows evolve with the passage of the active regions across the disk, no\ndiscernible precursors or other temporal changes specifically associated with\nflares are detected.\n", "  Context. The discovery of pulsations in low-mass stars opens an opportunity\nfor probing their interiors and to determine their evolution, by employing the\ntools of asteroseismology. Aims. We aim to analyze high-speed photometry of\nSDSSJ145847.02$+$070754.46 and SDSSJ173001.94$+$070600.25 and discover\nbrightness variabilities. In order to locate these stars in the $T_{\\rm eff} -\n\\log g$ diagram we fit optical spectra (SDSS) with synthetic non-magnetic\nspectra derived from model atmospheres. Methods. To carry out this study, we\nused the photometric data obtained by us for these stars with the 2.15m\ntelescope at CASLEO, Argentina. We analyzed their light curves and we apply the\nDiscrete Fourier Transform to determine the pulsation frequencies. Finally, we\ncompare both stars in the $T_{\\rm eff} - \\log g$ diagram, with known two\npre-white dwarfs, seven pulsating pre-ELM white dwarf stars, $\\delta$ Scuti and\nSX Phe stars. Results. We report the discovery of pulsations in\nSDSSJ145847.02$+$070754.46 and SDSSJ173001.94$+$070600.25. We determine their\neffective temperature and surface gravity to be $T_{\\rm eff}$ = 7 972 $\\pm$ 200\nK, $\\log g$ = 4.25 $\\pm$ 0.5 and $T_{\\rm eff}$ = 7 925 $\\pm$ 200 K, $\\log g$ =\n4.25 $\\pm$ 0.5, respectively. With these parameters these new pulsating\nlow-mass stars can be identified with either ELM white dwarfs (with ~ 0.17 Mo)\nor more massive SX Phe stars. We identified pulsation periods of 3 278.7 and 1\n633.9 s for SDSSJ145847.02$+$070754.46 and a pulsation period of 3 367.1 s for\nSDSSJ173001.94$+$070600.25. These two new objects together with those of Maxted\net al. (2013, 2014) indicate the possible existence of a new instability domain\ntowards the late stages of evolution of low-mass white dwarf stars, although\ntheir identification with SX Phe stars cannot be discarded.\n", "  Aims: We studied the precipitable water vapour (PWV) content near Cerro\nArmazones and discuss the potential use of our technique of modelling the\ntelluric absorbtion lines for the investigation of other molecular layers. The\nsite is designated for the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) and the\nnearby planned site for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). Methods:\nSpectroscopic data from the Bochum Echelle Spectroscopic Observer (BESO)\ninstrument were investigated by using line-by-line radiative transfer model\n(LBLRTM) radiative transfer models for the Earths atmosphere with the telluric\nabsorption correction tool molecfit. All observations from the archive in the\nperiod from December 2008 to the end of 2014 were investigated. The dataset\ncompletely covers the El Nino event registered in the period 2009-2010. Models\nof the 3D Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) were used for further\ncomparison. Moreover, for those days with coincidence of data from a similar\nstudy with VLT/X-shooter and microwave radiometer LHATPRO data at Cerro\nParanal, a direct comparison is presented. Results: This analysis shows that\nthe site has systematically lower PWV values, even after accounting for the\ndecrease in PWV expected from the higher altitude of the site with respect to\nCerro Paranal, using the average atmosphere found with radiosondes. We found\nthat GDAS data are not a suitable method for predicting of local atmospheric\nconditions - they usually systematically overestimate the PWV values. Due to\nthe large sample, we were furthermore able to characterize the site with\nrespect to symmetry across the sky and variation with the years and within the\nseasons. This kind of technique of studying the atmospheric conditions is shown\nto be a promising step into a possible monitoring equipment for CTA.\n", "  The surface brightness distribution of $\\sim$30-40$\\%$ of the early-type\ndwarf galaxies with $-18 \\leq M_{B} \\leq -15$ in the Virgo and the Coma\nclusters is fitted by models that include two structural components (S\\`ersic +\nexponential) as for bright disc galaxies.The goal of the present study is to\ndetermine whether early-type dwarf galaxies with a two-component stellar\nstructure in the Virgo and the Coma clusters are low-luminosity copies of\nbright disc galaxies or are the remnants of bright galaxies strongly\ntransformed by cluster environmental effects.I analysed the location of bright\ndisc galaxies and early-type dwarfs in the $r_{b,e}/h$- $n$ plane. The location\nin this plane of the two-component dwarf galaxies was compared with the\nremnants of tidally disrupted disc galaxies reported by numerical simulations.\nBright unbarred disc galaxies show a strong correlation in the $r_{b,e}/h$-$n$\nplane. Galaxies with larger S\\`ersic shape parameters show a higher $r_{b,e}/h$\nratio. In contrast, two-component early-type dwarf galaxies do not follow the\nsame correlation. A fraction ($\\sim$55%) of them are located outside the locus\ndefined in this plane by having 95$\\%$ of bright disc galaxies. This\ndistribution indicates that they are not a low-mass replica of bright disc\ngalaxies. The different location in the $r_{b,e}/h$- $n$ plane of two-component\nearly-type dwarfs and bright galaxies can be qualitatively explain whether the\nformer are remnants of disc galaxies strongly transformed by tidal\nprocesses.The progenitors of $\\sim$20-25% of early-type dwarf galaxies with\n$-18 \\leq M_{B} \\leq -15$ in the Virgo and Coma clusters could be bright disc\ngalaxies transformed by effects of the environment. These tidally transformed\ngalaxies can be selected according to their location in the $r_{b,e}/h$-$n$\nplane.\n", "  Many dense interstellar clouds are observable in emission in the near-IR,\ncommonly referred to as \"Cloudshine\", and in the mid-IR, the so-called\n\"Coreshine\". These C-shine observations have usually been explained with grain\ngrowth but no model has yet been able to self-consistently explain the dust\nspectral energy distribution from the near-IR to the submm. We want to\ndemonstrate the ability of our new core/mantle evolutionary dust model THEMIS\n(The Heterogeneous dust Evolution Model at the IaS), which has been shown to be\nvalid in the far-IR and submm, to reproduce the C-shine observations. Our\nstarting point is a physically motivated core/mantle dust model. It consists of\n3 dust populations: small aromatic-rich carbon grains; bigger core/mantle\ngrains with mantles of aromatic-rich carbon and cores either made of amorphous\naliphatic-rich carbon or amorphous silicate. We assume an evolutionary path\nwhere these grains, when entering denser regions, may first form a second\naliphatic-rich carbon mantle (coagulation of small grains, accretion of carbon\nfrom the gas phase), second coagulate together to form large aggregates, and\nthird accrete gas phase molecules coating them with an ice mantle. To compute\nthe corresponding dust emission and scattering, we use a 3D Monte-Carlo\nradiative transfer code. We show that our global evolutionary dust modelling\napproach THEMIS allows us to reproduce C-shine observations towards dense\nstarless clouds. Dust scattering and emission is most sensitive to the cloud\ncentral density and to the steepness of the cloud density profile. Varying\nthese two parameters leads to changes, which are stronger in the near-IR, in\nboth the C-shine intensity and profile. With a combination of aliphatic-rich\nmantle formation and low-level coagulation into aggregates, we can\nself-consistently explain the observed C-shine and far-IR/submm emission\ntowards dense starless clouds.\n", "  We present new SINFONI VLT observations of molecular hydrogen (H2) in the\ncentral regions (< 2.5 kpc) of the youngest and closest radio source PKS\nB1718-649. We study the distribution of the H2 traced by the 1-0 S(1)\nro-vibrational line, revealing a double disk structure with the kinematics of\nboth disks characterised by rotation. An outer disk (r > 650 pc) is aligned\nwith other components of the galaxy (atomic hydrogen, stars, dust), while the\ninner disk (r< 600 pc) is perpendicular to it and is polar with respect to the\nstellar distribution. However, in the innermost 75 pc, the data show the\npresence of H2 gas redshifted with respect to the rotating inner disk ($\\Delta\nv\\,$+150 km/s) which may trace gas falling into the super-massive black hole\nassociated with the central radio source. Along the same line of sight, earlier\nobservations had shown the presence in the central regions of PKS B1718-649 of\nclouds of atomic hydrogen with similar unsettled kinematics. The range of\nvelocities and mass of these unsettled clouds of HI and H2 suggest they may be\nactively contributing in fuelling the central newly-born radio source.\n", "  Probability density function (PDF) methods are a promising alternative to\npredicting the transport of solutes in groundwater under uncertainty. They make\nit possible to derive the evolution equations of the mean concentration and the\nconcentration variance, used in moment methods. A mixing model, also known as a\ndissipation model, is essential for both methods. Finding a satisfactory mixing\nmodel is still an open question and due to the rather elaborate PDF methods, a\ndifficult undertaking. Both the PDF equation and the concentration variance\nequation depend on the same mixing model. This connection is used to find and\ntest an improved mixing model for the much easier to handle concentration\nvariance. Subsequently, this mixing model is transferred to the PDF equation\nand tested. The newly proposed mixing model yields significantly improved\nresults for both variance modelling and PDF modelling.\n", "  Only a few well characterized very low-mass M dwarfs are known today. Our\nunderstanding of M dwarfs is vital as these are the most common stars in our\nsolar neighborhood. We aim to characterize the properties of a rare F+dM\nstellar system for a better understanding of the low-mass end of the\nHertzsprung-Russel diagram. We used photometric light curves and radial\nvelocity follow-up measurements to study the binary. Spectro- scopic analysis\nwas used in combination with isochrone fitting to characterize the primary\nstar. The primary star is an early F-type main-sequence star with a mass of\n(1.493 +- 0.073) Msun and a radius of (1.474 +- 0.040) Rsun. The companion is\nan M dwarf with a mass of (0.188 +- 0.014) Msun and a radius of (0.234 +-\n0.009) Rsun. The orbital period is (1.35121 +- 0:00001)d. The secondary star is\namong the lowest-mass M dwarfs known to date. The binary has not reached a 1:1\nspin-orbit synchronization. This indicates a young main-sequence binary with an\nage below ~250 Myrs. The mass-radius relation of both components are in\nagreement with this finding.\n", "  After a long-lasting period of quiescence of about a decade, the source V1118\nOri, one of the most representative members of the EXor variables, is now\noutbursting. Since the initial increase of the near-infrared flux of about 1\nmag (JHK bands) registered on 2015 September 22, the source brightness has\nremained fairly stable. We estimate DeltaV about 3 mag with respect to the\nquiescence phase. An optical/near-IR low-resolution spectrum has been obtained\nwith the Large Binocular Telescope instruments MODS and LUCI2, and compared\nwith a spectrum of similar spectral resolution and sensitivity level taken\nduring quiescence. Together with the enhancement of the continuum, the outburst\nspectrum presents a definitely higher number of emission lines, in particular\nHI recombination lines of the Balmer, Paschen, and Brackett series, along with\nbright permitted lines of several species, forbidden atomic lines, and CO\nro-vibrational lines. Both mass accretion and mass loss rates have\nsignificantly increased (by to about an order of magnitude, mass accretion rate\n= 1.2-4.8 10^-8 M_sun/yr, mass loss rate = 0.8-2 10^-9 M_sun/yr) with respect\nto the quiescence phase. If compared with previous outbursts, the present one\nappears less energetic. Alternatively, it could already be in the fading phase\n(with the maximum brightness level reached when the source was not visible),\nor, viceversa, still in the rising phase.\n", "  The northern tile of the wide-area and shallow XMM-XXL X-ray survey field is\nused to estimate the average dark matter halo mass of relatively luminous X-ray\nselected AGN [$\\rm\n  log\\, L_X (\\rm 2-10\\,keV)= 43.6^{+0.4}_{-0.4}\\,erg/s$] in the redshift\ninterval $z=0.5-1.2$. Spectroscopic follow-up observations of X-ray sources in\nthe XMM-XXL field by the Sloan telescope are combined with the VIPERS\nspectroscopic galaxy survey to determine the cross-correlation signal between\nX-ray selected AGN (total of 318) and galaxies (about 20,\\,000). We model the\nlarge scales (2-25\\,Mpc) of the correlation function to infer a mean dark\nmatter halo mass of $\\log M / (M_{\\odot} \\, h^{-1}) = 12.50 ^{+0.22} _{-0.30}$\nfor the X-ray selected AGN sample. This measurement is about 0.5\\,dex lower\ncompared to estimates in the literature of the mean dark matter halo masses of\nmoderate luminosity X-ray AGN [$L_X (\\rm 2-10\\,keV)\\approx 10^{42} -\n  10^{43}\\,erg/s$] at similar redshifts. Our analysis also links the mean\nclustering properties of moderate luminosity AGN with those of powerful\nUV/optically selected QSOs, which are typically found in halos with masses few\ntimes $10^{12}\\,M_{\\odot}$. There is therefore evidence for a negative\nluminosity dependence of the AGN clustering. This is consistent with\nsuggestions that AGN have a broad dark matter halo mass distribution with a\nhigh mass tail that becomes sub-dominant at high accretion luminosities. We\nfurther show that our results are in qualitative agreement with semi-analytic\nmodels of galaxy and AGN evolution, which attribute the wide range of dark\nmatter halo masses among the AGN population to different triggering mechanisms\nand/or black hole fueling modes.\n", "  Oscillating Algol-type eclipsing binaries (oEA) are very interesting objects\nthat have three observational features of eclipse, pulsation, and mass\ntransfer. Direct measurement of their masses and radii from the double-lined\nradial velocity data and photometric light curves would be the most essential\nfor understanding their evolutionary process and for performing the\nasteroseismological study. We present the physical properties of the oEA star\nXX Cep from high-resolution time-series spectroscopic data. The effective\ntemperature of the primary star was determined to be 7,946 $\\pm$ 240 K by\ncomparing the observed spectra and the Kurucz models. We detected the\nabsorption lines of the secondary star, which had never been detected in\nprevious studies, and obtained the radial velocities for both components. With\nthe published $BVRI$ light curves, we determined the absolute parameters for\nthe binary via Wilson-Devinney modeling. The masses and radii are $M_{1} = 2.49\n\\pm 0.06$ $M_\\odot$, $M_{2} = 0.38 \\pm 0.01$ $M_\\odot$, $R_{1} = 2.27 \\pm 0.02$\n$R_\\odot$, and $R_{2} = 2.43 \\pm 0.02$ $R_\\odot$, respectively. The primary\nstar is about $45 \\%$ more massive and $60 \\%$ larger than the zero-age main\nsequence (ZAMS) stars with the same effective temperature. It is probably\nbecause XX Cep has experienced a very different evolutionary process due to\nmass transfer, contrasting with the normal main sequence stars. The primary\nstar is located inside the theoretical instability strip of $\\delta$ Sct-type\nstars on HR diagram. We demonstrated that XX Cep is an oEA star, consisting of\na $\\delta$ Sct-type pulsating primary component and an evolved secondary\ncompanion.\n", "  We observe a significant change in the TW Hya disk interior to 40~AU via\narchival unpolarized multi-wavelength Hubble Space Telescope/STIS and NICMOS\nimages with an inner working angle (IWA) of 0\\farcs4 (22~AU). Our images show\nthe outer edge of a clearing at every wavelength with similar behavior,\ndemonstrating that the feature is structural, rather than due to some property\nof polarized light in the disk. We compare our observations to those taken by\nAkiyama et al. (2015) and Rapson et al. (2015), and discuss the spectral\nevolution of the disk interior to 80~AU. We construct a model with two gaps:\none at 30~AU and one at 80~AU that fit the observed surface brightness profile\nbut overpredicts the absolute brightness of the disk. Our models require an\nadditional dimming to be consistent with observations, which we tentatively\nascribe to shadowing. The gap structures seen in scattered light are spatially\ncoincident with sub-mm detections of CO and N$_2$H$^+$, and are near expected\ncondensation fronts of these molecular species, providing tentative evidence\nthat the structures seen in scattered light may be correlated with chemical\nchanges in the disk.\n", "  Superconductivity in the cuprates exhibits many unusual features. We study\nthe two-dimensional Hubbard model with plaquette dynamical mean-field theory to\naddress these unusual features and relate them to other normal-state phenomena,\nsuch as the pseudogap. Previous studies with this method found that upon doping\nthe Mott insulator at low temperature a pseudogap phase appears. The\nlow-temperature transition between that phase and the correlated metal at\nhigher doping is first-order. A series of crossovers emerge along the Widom\nline extension of that first-order transition in the supercritical region. Here\nwe show that the highly asymmetric dome of the dynamical mean-field\nsuperconducting transition temperature $T_c^d$, the maximum of the condensation\nenergy as a function of doping, the correlation between maximum $T_c^d$ and\nnormal-state scattering rate, the change from potential-energy driven to\nkinetic-energy driven pairing mechanisms can all be understood as remnants of\nthe normal state first-order transition and its associated crossovers that also\nact as an organizing principle for the superconducting state.\n", "  It was recently shown that the bolometric light curves of type II supernovae\n(SNe) allow an accurate and robust measurement of the product of the radiation\nenergy in the ejecta, $E_r$, and the time since the explosion, $t$, at early\nphases ($t\\lesssim 10d$) of the homologous expansion. This observable, denoted\nhere $ET \\equiv E_rt$ is constant during that time and depends only on the\nprogenitor structure and explosion energy. We use a 1D hydrodynamic code to\nfind $ET$ of simulated explosions of 145 red supergiant progenitors obtained\nusing the stellar evolution code MESA, and relate this observable to the\nproperties of the progenitor and the explosion energy. We show that $ET$ probes\nonly the properties of the envelope (velocity, mass and initial structure),\nsimilarly to other observables that rely on the photospheric phase emission.\nNevertheless, for explosions where the envelope dominates the ejected mass,\n$M_{env}/M_{ej} \\gtrsim 0.6$, $ET$ is directly related to the explosion energy\n$E_{exp}$ and ejected mass $M_{ej}$ through the relation $ET \\approx 0.15\nE_{exp}^{1/2} R_* M_{ej}^{1/2}$, where $R_*$ is the progenitor radius, to an\naccuracy better than $30\\%$. We also provide relations between $ET$ and the\nenvelope properties that are accurate (to within 20\\%) for all the progenitors\nin our sample, including those that lost most of their envelope. We show that\nwhen the envelope velocity can be reasonably measured by line shifts in\nobserved spectra, the envelope is directly constrained from the bolometric\nlight curve (independent of $E_{exp}$). We use that to compare observations of\n11 SNe with measured $ET$ and envelope velocity to our sample of numerical\nprogenitors. This comparison suggests that many SNe progenitors have radii that\nare $\\lesssim 500~R_\\odot$. In the framework of our simulations this indicates,\nmost likely, a rather high value of the mixing length parameter.\n", "  Massive giant planets, such as the ones being discovered by direct imaging\nsurveys, likely experience the majority of their growth through a\ncircumplanetary disc. We argue that the entropy of accreted material is\ndetermined by boundary layer processes, unlike the \"cold-\" or \"hot-start\"\nhypotheses usually invoked in the core accretion and direct collapse scenarios.\nA simple planetary evolution model illustrates how a wide range of radius and\nluminosity tracks become possible, depending on details of the accretion\nprocess. Specifically, the proto-planet evolves towards \"hot-start\" tracks if\nthe scale-height of the boundary layer is $\\gtrsim0.24$, a value not much\nlarger than the scale-height of the circumplanetary disc. Understanding the\nluminosity and radii of young giant planets will thus require detailed models\nof circumplanetary accretion.\n", "  The spectral position of the 3.6 micron continuum peak measured on\nCassini-VIMS I/F spectra is used as a marker to infer the temperature of the\nregolith particles covering the surfaces of Saturn's icy satellites. This\nfeature is characterizing the crystalline water ice spectrum which is the\ndominant compositional endmember of the satellites' surfaces. Laboratory\nmeasurements indicate that the position of the 3.6 micron peak of pure water\nice is temperature-dependent, shifting towards shorter wavelengths when the\nsample is cooled, from about 3.65 micron at T=123 K to about 3.55 micron at\nT=88 K. A similar method was already applied to VIMS Saturn's rings mosaics to\nretrieve ring particles temperature (Filacchione et al., 2014). We report here\nabout the daytime temperature variations observed on the icy satellites as\nderived from three different VIMS observation types. Temperature maps are built\nby mining the complete VIMS dataset collected in years 2004-2009 (pre-equinox)\nand in 2009-2012 (post equinox) by selecting pixels with max 150 km/pixel\nresolution. VIMS-derived temperature maps allow to identify thermal anomalies\nacross the equatorial lens of Mimas and Tethys.\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments with a Penning ion trap quantum simulator, we\nperform numerically exact Stochastic Series Expansion quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations of long-range transverse-field Ising models on a triangular lattice\nfor different decay powers $\\alpha$ of the interactions. The phase boundary for\nthe ferromagnet is obtained as a function of $\\alpha$. For antiferromagnetic\ninteractions, there is strong indication that the transverse field stabilizes a\nclock ordered phase with sublattice magnetization $(M,-\\frac{M}{2},\n-\\frac{M}{2})$ with unsaturated $M < 1$ in a process known as \"order by\ndisorder\" similar to the nearest neighbour antiferromagnet on the triangular\nlattice. Connecting the known limiting cases of nearest neighbour and\ninfinite-range interactions, a semiquantitative phase diagram is obtained.\nMagnetization curves for the ferromagnet for experimentally relevant system\nsizes and with open boundary conditions are presented.\n", "  Galactic cosmic rays are believed to be mostly accelerated at supernova\nshocks. However, the interstellar magnetic field is too weak to efficiently\naccelerate galactic cosmic rays up to the highest energies, i.e. $10^{15}$ eV.\nA stronger magnetic field in the pre-shock region could provide the efficiency\nrequired. Bell's cosmic-ray nonresonant streaming instability has been claimed\nto be responsible for the amplification of precursor magnetic fields. However,\nan alternative mechanism has been proposed in which the cosmic-ray pressure\ngradient forms the shock precursor and drives turbulence, amplifying the\nmagnetic field via the small-scale dynamo. A key ingredient for the mechanism\nto operate are the inhomogeneities present in the interstellar medium (ISM).\nThese inhomogeneities are the consequence of turbulence. In this work we\nexplore the magnetic field amplification in different ISM conditions through 3D\nMHD numerical simulations.\n", "  We identify [Rb IV] 1.5973 and [Cd IV] 1.7204 micron emission lines in\nhigh-resolution (R=40,000) near-infrared spectra of the planetary nebulae (PNe)\nNGC 7027 and IC 5117, obtained with the IGRINS spectrometer on the 2.7-m\ntelescope at McDonald Observatory. We also identify [Ge VI] 2.1930 $\\mu$m in\nNGC 7027. Alternate identifications for these features are ruled out based on\nthe absence of other multiplet members and/or transitions with the same upper\nlevels. Ge, Rb, and Cd can be enriched in PNe by s-process nucleosynthesis\nduring the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stage of evolution. To determine ionic\nabundances, we calculate [Rb IV] collision strengths and use approximations for\nthose of [Cd IV] and [Ge VI]. Our identification of [Rb IV] 1.5973 $\\mu$m is\nsupported by the agreement between Rb3+/H+ abundances found from this line and\nthe 5759.55 A feature in NGC 7027. Elemental Rb, Cd, and Ge abundances are\nderived with ionization corrections based on similarities in ionization\npotential ranges between the detected ions and O and Ne ionization states. Our\nanalysis indicates abundances 2-4 times solar for Rb and Cd in both nebulae. Ge\nis subsolar in NGC 7027, but its abundance is uncertain due to the large and\nuncertain ionization correction. The general consistency of the measured\nrelative s-process enrichments with predictions from models appropriate for\nthese PNe (2.0-2.5 M_sun, [Fe/H]= -0.37) demonstrates the potential of using PN\ncompositions to test s-process nucleosynthesis models.\n", "  Due to the knowledge of the rotation period and the presence of a rather\nstrong surface magnetic field, the sharp-lined young Herbig Ae star HD 101412\nwith a rotation period of 42 d has become one of the most well-studied targets\namong the Herbig Ae stars. High-resolution HARPS polarimetric spectra of HD\n101412 were recently obtained on seven different epochs. Our study of the\nspectral variability over the part of the rotation cycle covered by HARPS\nobservations reveals that the line profiles of the elements Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr,\nMn, Fe, and Sr are clearly variable while He exhibits variability that is\nopposite to the behaviour of the other elements studied. Since classical Ap\nstars usually show a relationship between the magnetic field geometry and the\ndistribution of element spots, we used in our magnetic field measurements\ndifferent line samples belonging to the three elements with the most numerous\nspectral lines, Ti, Cr, and Fe. Over the time interval covered by the available\nspectra, the longitudinal magnetic field changes sign from negative to positive\npolarity. The distribution of field values obtained using Ti, Cr, and Fe lines\nis, however, completely different compared to the magnetic field values\ndetermined in previous low-resolution FORS 2 measurements, where hydrogen\nBalmer lines are the main contributors to the magnetic field measurements,\nindicating the presence of concentration of the studied iron-peak elements in\nthe region of the magnetic equator. Further, we discuss the potential role of\ncontamination by the surrounding warm circumstellar matter in the appearance of\nZeeman features obtained using Ti lines.\n", "  In this paper, we show a \"proof of concept\" of the heating mechanism of the\nsolar chromosphere due to wave dissipation caused by the effects of partial\nionization. Numerical modeling of non-linear wave propagation in a magnetic\nflux tube, embedded in the solar atmosphere, is performed by solving a system\nof single-fluid quasi-MHD equations, which take into account the ambipolar term\nfrom the generalized Ohm's law. It is shown that perturbations caused by\nmagnetic waves can be effectively dissipated due to ambipolar diffusion. The\nenergy input by this mechanism is continuous and shown to be more efficient\nthan dissipation of static currents, ultimately leading to chromospheric\ntemperature increase in magnetic structures.\n", "  The radiative cooling of shocked gas with primordial chemical composition is\nan important process relevant to the formation of the first stars and\nstructures, as well as taking place also in high velocity cloud collisions and\nsupernovae explosions. Among the different processes that need to be\nconsidered, the formation kinetics and cooling of molecular hydrogen are of\nprime interest, since they provide the only way to lower the gas temperature to\nvalues well below $\\sim$10$^4$~K. In previous works, the internal energy level\nstructure of H$_2$ and its cation has been treated in the approximation of\nrovibrational ground state at low densities, or trying to describe the dynamics\nusing some arbitrary $v>0$ H$_2$ level that is considered representative of the\nexcited vibrational manifold. In this study, we compute the vibrationally\nresolved kinetics for the time-dependent chemical and thermal evolution of the\npost-shock gas in a medium of primordial composition. The calculated\nnon-equilibrium distributions are used to evaluate effects on the cooling\nfunction of the gas and on the cooling time. Finally, we discuss the dependence\nof the results to different initial values of the shock velocity and redshift.\n", "  We present a spectroscopic analysis of the pre-eruptive configuration of\nactive region NOAA 11429, prior to two very fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs)\non March 7, 2012 that are associated with this active region. We study the\nthermal components and the dynamics associated with the ejected flux ropes.\nUsing differential emission measure (DEM) analysis of Hinode/EIS and SDO/AIA\nobservations, we identify the emission components of both the flux rope and the\nhost active region. We then follow the time evolution of the flux rope emission\ncomponents by using AIA observations. The plasma density and the Doppler and\nnon-thermal velocities associated with the flux ropes are also calculated from\nthe EIS data. The eastern and western parts of the active region, in which the\ntwo different fast CMEs originated during two X-class flares, were studied\nseparately. In both regions we identified an emission component in the\ntemperature range of $\\log T=6.8 - 7.1$ associated with the presence of flux\nropes. The time evolution of the eastern region showed an increase in the mean\nDEM in this temperature range by an order of magnitude, 5 hours prior to the\nfirst CME. This was associated with a gradual rise and heating of the flux rope\nas manifested by blue-shifts and increased non-thermal velocities in\n\\ion{Ca}{XV}~200.97\\AA, respectively. An overall upward motion of the flux\nropes was measured (relative blue-shifts of $\\sim12$~\\kms). The measured\nelectron density was found to be $4\\times 10^9 - 2 \\times10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$\n(using the ratio of \\ion{Ca}{XV}~181.90\\AA\\ over \\ion{Ca}{XV}~200.97\\AA). We\ncompare our findings with other works on the same AR to provide a unified\npicture of its evolution.\n", "  Ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs) have the sizes of giant galaxies but the\nluminosities of dwarfs. A key to understanding their origins comes from their\ntotal masses, but their low surface brightnesses ($\\mu(V) \\geq$ 25.0) generally\nprohibit dynamical studies. Here we report the first such measurements for a\nUDG (VCC~1287 in the Virgo cluster), based on its globular cluster system\ndynamics and size. From 7 GCs we measure a mean systemic velocity $v_{\\rm sys}$\n= 1071$^{+14}_{-15}$ km/s, thereby confirming a Virgo-cluster association. We\nmeasure a velocity dispersion of 33$^{+16}_{-10}$ km/s within 8.1 kpc,\ncorresponding to an enclosed mass of $(4.5 \\pm 2.8)\\times10^{9}$ $M_{\\odot}$\nand a $g$-band mass-to-light ratio of $(M/L)_g = 106^{+126}_{-54}$. From the\ncumulative mass curve, along with the GC numbers, we estimate a virial mass of\n$\\sim8\\times10^{10}$ $M_{\\odot}$, yielding a dark-to-stellar mass fraction of\n$\\sim3000$. We show that this UDG is an outlier in $M_{\\rm star} - M_{\\rm\nhalo}$ relations, suggesting extreme stochasticity in relatively massive\nstar-forming halos in clusters. Finally, we discuss how counting GCs offers an\nefficient route to determining virial masses for UDGs.\n", "  Aims: We investigate the suitability of {\\alpha}-viscosity in self-similar\nmodels for self-gravitating disks with a focus on active galactic nuclei (AGN)\ndisks.\n  Methods: We use a self-similar approach to simplify the partial differential\nequations arising from the evolution equation, which are then solved using\nnumerical standard procedures.\n  Results: We find a self-similar solution for the dynamical evolution of\nself-gravitating {\\alpha}-disks and derive the significant quantities. In the\nKeplerian part of the disk our model is consistent with standard stationary\n{\\alpha}-disk theory, and self-consistent throughout the self-gravitating\nregime. Positive accretion rates throughout the disk demand a high degree of\nself-gravitation. Combined with the temporal decline of the accretion rate and\nits low amount, the model prohibits the growth of large central masses.\n  Conclusions: {\\alpha}-viscosity cannot account for the evolution of the whole\nmass spectrum of super-massive black holes (SMBH) in AGN. However, considering\nthe involved scales it seems suitable for modelling protoplanetary disks.\n  Keywords: accretion, accretion disks, turbulence, hydrodynamics, methods:\nanalytical\n", "  Jets present ubiquitously in both quiet and active regions on the Sun. They\nare widely believed to be driven by magnetic reconnection. A fan-spine\nstructure has been frequently reported in some coronal jets and flares,\nregarded as a signature of ongoing magnetic reconnection in a topology\nconsisting of a magnetic null connected by a fan-like separatrix surface and a\nspine. However, for small-scale chromospheric jets, clear evidence of such\nstructures is rather rare, although they are implied in earlier works that show\nan inverted-Y-shaped feature. Here we report high-resolution (0$\"$.16)\nobservations of a small-scale chromospheric jet obtained by the New Solar\nTelescope (NST) using 10830~{\\AA} filtergrams. Bi-directional flows were\nobserved across the separatrix regions in the 10830~\\AA{} images, suggesting\nthat the jet was produced due to magnetic reconnection. At the base of the jet,\na fan-spine structure was clearly resolved by the NST, including the spine and\nthe fan-like surface, as well as the loops before and after the reconnection. A\nmajor part of this fan-spine structure, with the exception of its bright\nfootpoints and part of the base arc, was invisible in the extreme ultraviolet\nand soft X-ray images (observed by the Atmosphere Imaging Assembly and the\nX-Ray Telescope, respectively), indicating that the reconnection occurred in\nthe upper chromosphere. Our observations suggest that the evolution of this\nchromospheric jet is consistent with a two-step reconnection scenario proposed\nby \\citet{Torok2009}\n", "  We present an analytical theory of topologically protected photonic states\nfor the two-dimensional Maxwell equations for a class of continuous periodic\ndielectric structures, modulated by a domain wall. We further numerically\nconfirm the applicability of this theory for three-dimensional structures.\n", "  We explore planetary migration scenarios for formation of high inclination\nNeptune Trojans (NTs) and how they are affected by the planetary migration of\nNeptune and Uranus. If Neptune and Uranus's eccentricity and inclination were\ndamped during planetary migration, then their eccentricities and inclinations\nwere higher prior and during migration than their current values. Using test\nparticle integrations we study the stability of primordial NTs, objects that\nwere initially Trojans with Neptune prior to migration. We also study\nTrans-Neptunian objects captured into resonance with Neptune and becoming NTs\nduring planet migration. We find that most primordial NTs were unstable and\nlost if eccentricity and inclination damping took place during planetary\nmigration. With damping, secular resonances with Neptune can increase a low\neccentricity and inclination population of Trans-Neptunian objects increasing\nthe probability that they are captured into 1:1 resonance with Neptune,\nbecoming high inclination NTs. We suggest that the resonant trapping scenario\nis a promising and more effective mechanism explaining the origin of NTs that\nis particularly effective if Uranus and Neptune experienced eccentricity and\ninclination damping during planetary migration.\n", "  Gravitational waves emitted by the merger of two black holes have been\ndetected, setting the course for a new era of observational astrophysics.\n", "  Deformation twinning in hexagonal crystals is often considered as a way to\npalliate the lack of independent slip systems. This mechanism might be either\nexacerbated or shut down in small-scale crystals whose mechanical behavior can\nsignificantly deviate from bulk materials. Here, we show that sub-micron\nberyllium fibers initially free of dislocation and tensile tested in-situ in a\ntransmission electron microscope (TEM) deform by a $\\{ 10\\bar{1}2 \\}$ $\\langle\n10\\bar{1}1 \\rangle$ twin thickening. The propagation speed of the twin boundary\nseems to be entirely controlled by the nucleation of twinning dislocations\ndirectly from the surface. The shear produced is in agreement with the repeated\nlateral motion of twinning dislocations. We demonstrate that the activation\nvolume ($V$) associated with the twin boundary propagation can be retrieved\nfrom the measure of the twin boundary speed as the stress decreases as in a\nclassical relaxation mechanical test. The value of $V \\approx 8.3 \\pm 3.3\n\\times 10^{-29}m^3$ is comparable to the value expected from surface\nnucleation.\n", "  Finite-temperature DFT has become of topical interest, partly due to the\nincreasing ability to create novel states of warm-correlated matter (WCM).\nSubclasses of WCM are Warm-dense matter (WDM), ultra-fast matter (UFM), and\nhigh-energy density matter (HEDM), containing electyrons (e) and ions (i).\nStrong e-e, i-i and e-i correlation effects and partial degeneracies are found\nin these systems where the electron temperature $T_e $ is comparable to the\nelectron Fermi energy. The ion subsystem may be solid, liquid or plasma, with\nmany states of ionization with ionic charge $Z_j$. Quasi-equilibria with the\nion temperature $T_i\\ne T_e$ are common. The ion subsystem in WCM can no longer\nbe treated as a passive \"external potential\", as is customary in $T=0$ density\nfunctional theory (DFT) dominated by solid-state theory or quantum chemistry.\nHohenberg-Kohn-Mermin theory can be used for WCMs if finite-$T$\nexchange-correlation (XC) functionals are available. They are functionals of\nboth the one-body electron density $n_e$ and the one-body ion densities\n$\\rho_j$. A method of approximately but accurately mapping the quantum\nelectrons to a classical Coulomb gas enables one to treat electron-ion systems\nentirely classically at any temperature and arbitrary spin polarization, using\nexchange-correlation effects calculated {\\it in situ}, directly from the\npair-distribution functions. This eliminates the need for any XC-functionals,\nor the use of a Born-Oppenheimer approximation. This classical map has been\nused to calculate the equation of state of WDM systems, and construct a\nfinite-$T$ XC functional that is found to be in close agreement with recent\nquantum path-integral simulation data. In this review current developments and\nconcerns in finite-$T$ DFT, especially in the context of non-relativistic\nwarm-dense matter and ultra-fast matter will be presented.\n", "  Mergers of stellar-mass black holes (BHs), such as GW150914 observed by LIGO,\nare not expected to have electromagnetic counterparts. However, the Fermi GBM\ndetector identified of a gamma-ray transient 0.4 s after the gravitational wave\n(GW) signal GW150914 with consistent sky localization. I show that the two\nsignals might be related if the BH binary detected by LIGO originated from two\nclumps in a dumbbell configuration that formed when the core of a rapidly\nrotating massive star collapsed. In that case, the BH binary merger was\nfollowed by a gamma-ray burst (GRB) from a jet that originated in the accretion\nflow around the remnant BH. A future detection of a GRB afterglow could be used\nto determine the redshift and precise localization of the source. A population\nof standard GW sirens with GRB redshifts would provide a new approach for\nprecise measurements of cosmological distances as a function of redshift.\n", "  The ESO public survey VISTA Variables in the V\\'ia L\\'actea (VVV) has\ncontributed with deep multi-epoch photometry of the Galactic bulge and the\nadjacent part of the disk over 526 square degrees. More than a hundred cluster\ncandidates have been reported thanks to this survey. We present the fifth\narticle in a series of papers focused on young and massive clusters discovered\nin the VVV survey. In this paper, we present the physical characterization of\nfive clusters with a spectroscopically confirmed OB-type stellar population. To\ncharacterize the clusters, we used near-infrared photometry ($J$, $H,$ and\n$K_S$) from the VVV survey and near-infrared $K$-band spectroscopy from ISAAC\nat VLT, following the methodology presented in the previous articles of the\nseries. All clusters in our sample are very young (ages between 1-20 Myr), and\ntheir total mass are between $(1.07^{+0.40}_{-0.30})\\cdot10^2$ $M_{\\odot}$ and\n$(4.17^{+4.15}_{-2.08})\\cdot10^3$ $M_{\\odot}$. We observed a relation between\nthe clusters total mass $M_{ecl}$ and the mass of their most massive stellar\nmember $m_{max}$, even for clusters with an age $<$ 10 Myr.\n", "  It is noted that the Legendre transformations in the standard formulation of\nquantum field theory have the form of functional Clairaut-type equations. It is\nshown that in presence of composite fields the Clairaut-type form holds after\nloop corrections are taken into account. A new solution to the functional\nClairaut-type equation appearing in field theories with composite fields is\nfound.\n", "  Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious transient sources. If extragalactic,\nas suggested by their relative large dispersion measures, their brightness\ntemperatures must be extremely high. Some FRB models (e.g. young pulsar model,\nmagnetar giant flare model, or supra-massive neutron star collapse model)\nsuggest that they may be associated with a synchrotron nebula. Here we study a\nsynchrotron-heating process by an FRB in a self-absorbed synchrotron nebula. If\nthe FRB frequency is below the synchrotron self-absorption frequency of the\nnebula, electrons in the nebula would absorb FRB photons, leading to a harder\nelectron spectrum and enhanced self-absorbed synchrotron emission. In the\nmeantime, the FRB flux is absorbed by the nebula electrons. We calculate the\nspectra of FRB-heated synchrotron nebulae, and show that the nebula spectra\nwould show a significant hump in several decades near the self-absorption\nfrequency. Identifying such a spectral feature would reveal an embedded FRB in\na synchrotron nebula.\n", "  Terrestrial planets at the inner edge of the habitable zone of late-K and\nM-dwarf stars are expected to be in synchronous rotation, as a consequence of\nstrong tidal interactions with their host stars. Previous global climate model\n(GCM) studies have shown that, for slowly-rotating planets, strong convection\nat the substellar point can create optically thick water clouds, increasing the\nplanetary albedo, and thus stabilizing the climate against a thermal runaway.\nHowever these studies did not use self-consistent orbital/rotational periods\nfor synchronously rotating planets placed at different distances from the host\nstar. Here we provide new estimates of the inner edge of the habitable zone for\nsynchronously rotating terrestrial planets around late-K and M-dwarf stars\nusing a 3-D Earth-analog GCM with self-consistent relationships between stellar\nmetallicity, stellar effective temperature, and the planetary\norbital/rotational period. We find that both atmospheric dynamics and the\nefficacy of the substellar cloud deck are sensitive to the precise rotation\nrate of the planet. Around mid-to-late M-dwarf stars with low metallicity,\nplanetary rotation rates at the inner edge of the HZ become faster, and the\ninner edge of the habitable zone is farther away from the host stars than in\nprevious GCM studies. For an Earth-sized planet, the dynamical regime of the\nsubstellar clouds begins to transition as the rotation rate approaches ~10\ndays. These faster rotation rates produce stronger zonal winds that encircle\nthe planet and smear the substellar clouds around it, lowering the planetary\nalbedo, and causing the onset of the water-vapor greenhouse climatic\ninstability to occur at up to ~25% lower incident stellar fluxes than found in\nprevious GCM studies. For mid-to-late M-dwarf stars with high metallicity and\nfor mid-K to early-M stars, we agree with previous studies.\n", "  The use of special operations forces (SOF) in war fighting and peace keeping\nefforts has increased dramatically in recent decades. A scientific\nunderstanding of the reason for this increase would provide guidance as to the\ncontexts in which SOF can be used to their best effect. Ashby's law of\nrequisite variety provides a scientific framework for understanding and\nanalyzing a system's ability to survive and prosper in the face of\nenvironmental challenges. We have developed a generalization of this law to\nextend the analysis to systems that must respond to disturbances at multiple\nscales. This analysis identifies a necessary tradeoff between scale and\ncomplexity in a multiscale control system. As with Ashby's law, the framework\napplies to the characterization of successful biological and social systems in\nthe context of complex environmental challenges. Here we apply this multiscale\nframework to provide a control theoretic understanding of the historical and\nincreasing need for SOF, as well as conventional military forces. We propose\nthat the essential role distinction is in the separation between high\ncomplexity fine scale challenges as opposed to large scale challenges. This\nleads to a correspondence between the role SOF can best serve and that of the\nimmune system in complex organisms--namely, the ability to respond to\nfine-grained, high-complexity disruptors and preserve tissue health. Much like\na multicellular organism, human civilization is composed of a set of distinct\nand heterogeneous social tissues. Responding to disruption and restoring health\nin a system with highly diverse local social conditions is an essentially\ncomplex task. SOF have the potential to mitigate against harm without\ndisrupting normal social tissue behavior. This analysis suggests how SOF might\nbe leveraged to support global stability and mitigate against cascading crises.\n", "  A D-dimensional gravitational model with Gauss-Bonnet and cosmological term\nis considered. When ansatz with diagonal cosmological metrics is adopted, we\noverview recent solutions for zero cosmological term and find new examples of\nsolutions for non-zero cosmological term and D = 8 with exponential dependence\nof scale factors which describe an expansion of our 3-dimensional factor-space\nand contraction of 4-dimensional internal space.\n", "  We consider the spherically symmetric black hole solution of the\nRandall-Sundrum (RS) model. This asymptotically-Schwarzschild solution was\nfound by Abdolrahimi, Cation, Page and Yaghoobpour-Tari (ACPY-solution). We\ninvestigate the specific properties of the accretion disk around ACPY black\nhole having astrophysical size and mass. The energy flux and temperature\ndistribution are obtained and compared with the Schwarzschild ones. We also\npresent the spectral energy distribution of the accretion disk around RS black\nholes, when the transfer function is taken into account. Thus we confirm a full\nagreement of the accretion rate in RS model with the GR predictions. Using\nrecent data on the high-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-1 and on the Galactic centre\nblack hole candidate Sgr A* we model the accretion in the RS model.\n", "  Recent experiments have demonstrated that in a dense monolayer of\nphoto-switchable dye Methyl-Red molecules the relaxation of an initial\nbirefringence follows a power-law decay, typical for glass-like dynamics. The\nslow relaxation can efficiently be controlled and accelerated by illuminating\nthe monolayer with circularly polarized light, which induces trans-cis\nisomerization cycles. To elucidate the microscopic mechanism, we develop a\ntwo-dimensional molecular model in which the trans and cis isomers are\nrepresented by straight and bent needles, respectively. As in the experimental\nsystem, the needles are allowed to rotate and to form overlaps but they cannot\ntranslate. The out-of-equilibrium rotational dynamics of the needles is\ngenerated using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. We demonstrate that, in a\nregime of high density and low temperature, the power-law relaxation can be\ntraced to the formation of spatio-temporal correlations in the rotational dy-\nnamics, i.e., dynamic heterogeneity. We also show that the nearly isotropic cis\nisomers can prevent dynamic heterogeneity from forming in the monolayer and\nthat the relaxation then becomes exponential.\n", "  We aim to explore whether strong magnetic fields can be effectively generated\nin low-mass dwarf galaxies and, if so, whether such fields can be affected by\ngalactic outflows and spread out into the intergalactic medium (IGM). We\nperformed a radio continuum polarimetry study of IC10, the nearest starbursting\ndwarf galaxy, using a combination of multifrequency interferometric (VLA) and\nsingle-dish (Effelsberg) observations. VLA observations at 1.43 GHz reveal an\nextensive and almost spherical radio halo of IC10 in total intensity, extending\ntwice more than the infrared-emitting galactic disk. The halo is magnetized\nwith a magnetic field strength of 7 microG in the outermost parts. Locally, the\nmagnetic field reaches about 29 microG in HII complexes, becomes more ordered,\nand weakens to 22 microG in the synchrotron superbubble and to 7-10 microG\nwithin HI holes. At the higher frequency of 4.86 GHz, we found a large-scale\nmagnetic field structure of X-shaped morphology, similar to that observed in\nseveral edge-on spiral galaxies. The X-shaped magnetic structure can be caused\nby the galactic wind, advecting magnetic fields injected into the interstellar\nmedium by stellar winds and supernova explosions. The radio continuum scale\nheights at 1.43 GHz indicate the bulk speed of cosmic-ray electrons outflowing\nfrom HII complexes of about 60 km/s, exceeding the escape velocity of 40 km/s.\nHence, the magnetized galactic wind in IC10 inflates the extensive radio halo\nvisible at 1.43 GHz and can seed the IGM with both random and ordered magnetic\nfields. These are signatures of intense material feedback onto the IGM,\nexpected to be prevalent in the protogalaxies of the early Universe.\n", "  We explore the presence of non-stellar rest-frame near-IR ($2-5 \\ \\mu\n\\mathrm{m}$) emission in galaxies at $z \\sim 1$. Previous studies identified\nthis excess in relatively small samples and suggested that such non-stellar\nemission, which could be linked to the $3.3 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{m}$ polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbons feature or hot dust emission, is associated with an\nincreased star formation rate (SFR). In this Letter, we confirm and quantify\nthe presence of an IR excess in a significant fraction of galaxies in the\n3D-HST GOODS catalogs. By constructing a matched sample of galaxies with and\nwithout strong non-stellar near-IR emission, we find that galaxies with such\nemission are predominantly star-forming galaxies. Moreover, star-forming\ngalaxies with an excess show increased mid- and far-IR and H$\\alpha$ emission\ncompared to other star-forming galaxies without. While galaxies with a near-IR\nexcess show a larger fraction of individually detected X-ray active galactic\nnuclei (AGNs), an X-ray stacking analysis, together with the IR-colors and\nH$\\alpha$ profiles, shows that AGNs are unlikely to be the dominant source of\nthe excess in the majority of galaxies. Our results suggest that non-stellar\nnear-IR emission is linked to increased SFRs and is ubiquitous among\nstar-forming galaxies. As such, the near-IR emission might be a powerful tool\nto measure SFRs in the era of the James Webb Space Telescope.\n", "  In this work we model the observed evolution in comoving number density of\nLyman-alpha blobs (LABs) as a function of redshift, and try to find which\nmechanism of emission is dominant in LAB. Our model calculates LAB emission\nboth from cooling radiation from the intergalactic gas accreting onto galaxies\nand from star formation (SF). We have used dark matter (DM) cosmological\nsimulation to which we applied empirical recipes for Ly$\\alpha$ emission\nproduced by cooling radiation and SF in every halo. In difference to the\nprevious work, the simulated volume in the DM simulation is large enough to\nproduce an average LABs number density. At a range of redshifts $z\\sim 1-7$ we\ncompare our results with the observed luminosity functions of LABs and LAEs.\nOur cooling radiation luminosities appeared to be too small to explain LAB\nluminosities at all redshifts. In contrast, for SF we obtained a good agreement\nwith observed LFs at all redshifts studied. We also discuss uncertainties which\ncould influence the obtained results, and how LAB LFs could be related to each\nother in fields with different density.\n", "  With the high spatial and temporal resolution H$\\alpha$ images from the New\nVacuum Solar Telescope, we focus on two groups of loops with a X-shaped\nconfiguration in the dynamic chromosphere. We find that the anti-directed loops\napproach each other and reconnect continually. The connectivity of the loops is\nchanged and new loops are formed and stack together. The stacked loops are\nsharply bent, implying that they are greatly impacted by the magnetic tension\nforce. When another more reconnection process takes place, one new loop is\nformed and stacks with the previously formed ones. Meanwhile, the stacked loops\nretract suddenly and move toward the balance position, performing an overshoot\nmovement, which led to an oscillation with an average period of about 45 s. The\noscillation of newly formed loops after magnetic reconnection in the\nchromosphere is observed for the first time. We suggest that the stability of\nthe stacked loops is destroyed due to the join of the last new loop and then\nsuddenly retract under the effect of magnetic tension. Because of the\nretraction, another lower loop is pushed outward and performs an oscillation\nwith the period of about 25 s. The different oscillation periods may be due to\ntheir difference in three parameters, i.e., loop length, plasma density, and\nmagnetic field strength.\n", "  Jets are defined as impulsive, well-collimated upflows, occurring in\ndifferent layers of the solar atmosphere with different scales. Their\nrelationship with coronal mass ejections (CMEs), another type of solar\nimpulsive events, remains elusive. Using the high-quality imaging data of\nAIA/SDO, here we show a well-observed coronal jet event, in which part of the\njets, with the embedding coronal loops, runs into a nearby coronal hole (CH)\nand gets bounced towards the opposite direction. This is evidenced by the\nflat-shape of the jet front during its interaction with the CH and the V-shaped\nfeature in the time-slice plot of the interaction region. About a half-hour\nlater, a CME initially with a narrow and jet-like front is observed by the\nLASCO C2 coronagraph, propagating along the direction of the post-collision\njet. We also observe some 304 A dark material flowing from the jet-CH\ninteraction region towards the CME. We thus suggest that the jet and the CME\nare physically connected, with the jet-CH collision and the large- scale\nmagnetic topology of the CH being important to define the eventual propagating\ndirection of this particular jet-CME eruption.\n", "  It is inferred from the chemical shift of muon spin rotation ($\\mu$SR)\nspectra that muons implanted in pristine (fully oxidized) mayenite,\n[Ca$_{12}$Al$_{14}$O$_{32}]^{2+}$[$\\square_5$O$^{2-}$] (C12A7, with $\\square$\nreferring to the vacant cage), are bound to O$^{2-}$ at the cage center to form\nOMu$^-$ (where Mu represents muonium, a muonic analog of the H atom). However,\nan isolated negatively charged state (Mu$^-$, an analog of H$^-$) becomes\ndominant when the compound approaches the state of electride\n[Ca$_{12}$Al$_{14}$O$_{32}]^{2+}$[$\\square_4$2e$^{-}$] as a result of the\nreduction process. Moreover, the OMu$^-$ state in the pristine specimen\nexhibits depolarization of paramagnetic origin at low temperatures (below\n$\\sim$30~K), indicating that OMu$^-$ accompanies a loosely bound electron in\nthe cage that can be thermally activated. This suggests that interstitial muons\n(and hence H) forming a \"cage electron-hydroxyl\" complex can serve as electron\ndonors in C12A7.\n", "  All the fields of the extended space mission Kepler/K2 are located within the\necliptic. Many solar system objects thus cross the K2 stellar masks on a\nregular basis. We aim at providing to the entire community a simple tool to\nsearch and identify solar system objects serendipitously observed by Kepler.\nThe SkyBoT service hosted at IMCCE provides a Virtual Observatory (VO)\ncompliant cone-search that lists all solar system objects present within a\nfield of view at a given epoch. To generate such a list in a timely manner,\nephemerides are pre-computed, updated weekly, and stored in a relational\ndatabase to ensure a fast access. The SkyBoT Web service can now be used with\nKepler. Solar system objects within a small (few arcminutes) field of view are\nidentified and listed in less than 10 sec. Generating object data for the\nentire K2 field of view (14{\\deg}) takes about a minute. This extension of the\nSkyBot service opens new possibilities with respect to mining K2 data for solar\nsystem science, as well as removing solar system objects from stellar\nphotometric time-series.\n", "  We provide a new view on the Cygnus-X north complex by accessing for the\nfirst time the low mass content of young stellar populations in the region.\nCFHT/WIRCam camera was used to perform a deep near-IR survey of this complex,\nsampling stellar masses down to ~0.1 M$_\\odot$. Several analysis tools,\nincluding a extinction treatment developed in this work, were employed to\nidentify and uniformly characterise a dozen unstudied young star clusters in\nthe area. Investigation of their mass distributions in low-mass domain revealed\na relatively uniform log-normal IMF with a characteristic mass of 0.32$\\pm$0.08\nM$_\\odot$ and mass dispersion of 0.40$\\pm$0.06. In the high mass regime, their\nderived slopes showed that while the youngest clusters (age < 4 Myr) presented\nslightly shallower values with respect to the Salpeter's, our older clusters (4\nMyr < age < 18 Myr) showed IMF compliant values and a slightly denser stellar\npopulation. Although possibly evidencing a deviation from an 'universal' IMF,\nthese results also supports a scenario where these gas dominated young clusters\ngradually 'build up' their IMF by accreting low-mass stars formed in their\nvicinity during their first ~3 Myr, before the gas expulsion phase, emerging at\nthe age of ~4 Myr with a fully fledged IMF. Finally, the derived distances to\nthese clusters confirmed the existence of at least 3 different star forming\nregions throughout Cygnus-X north complex, at distances of 500-900 pc, 1.4-1.7\nkpc and 3.0 kpc, and revealed evidence of a possible interaction between some\nof these stellar populations and the Cygnus-OB2 association.\n", "  Given that a majority of stars form in multiple systems, in order to fully\nunderstand the star- and planet-formation processes we must seek to understand\nthem in multiple stellar systems. With this in mind, we present an analysis of\nthe enigmatic binary T-Tauri system VV Corona Australis, in which both\ncomponents host discs, but only one is visible at optical wavelengths. We seek\nto understand the peculiarities of this system by searching for a model for the\nbinary which explains all the available continuum observations of the system.\nWe present new mid-infrared interferometry and near-infrared spectroscopy along\nwith archival millimetre-wave observations, which resolve the binary at 1.3mm\nfor the first time. We compute a grid of pre-main-sequence radiative transfer\nmodels and calculate their posterior probabilities given the observed spectral\nenergy distributions and mid-infrared interferometric visibilities of the\nbinary components, beginning with the assumption that the only differences\nbetween the two components are their inclination and position angles. Our\nbest-fitting solution corresponds to a relatively low luminosity T-tauri\nbinary, with each component's disc having a large scale height and viewed at\nmoderate inclination ($\\sim 50^\\circ$), with the infrared companion inclined by\n$\\sim 5^\\circ$ degrees more than the primary. Comparing the results of our\nmodel to evolutionary models suggests stellar masses $\\sim 1.7$M$_\\odot$ and an\nage for the system of 3.5Myr, towards the upper end of previous estimates.\nCombining these results with accretion indicators from near-IR spectroscopy, we\ndetermine an accretion rate of 4.0$\\times 10^{-8}$M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for the\nprimary. We suggest that future observations of VV~CrA and similar systems\nshould prioritise high angular resolution sub-mm and near-IR imaging of the\ndiscs and high resolution optical/NIR spectroscopy of the central stars.\n", "  We identify two distinct physical mechanisms for dust gap opening by embedded\nplanets in protoplanetary discs based on the symmetry of the drag-induced\nmotion around the planet: I) A mechanism where low mass planets, that do not\ndisturb the gas, open gaps in dust by tidal torques assisted by drag in the\ninner disc, but resisted by drag in the outer disc; and II) The usual, drag\nassisted, mechanism where higher mass planets create pressure maxima in the gas\ndisc which the drag torque then acts to evacuate further in the dust. The first\nmechanism produces gaps in dust but not gas, while the second produces partial\nor total gas gaps which are deeper in the dust phase. Dust gaps do not\nnecessarily indicate gas gaps.\n", "  The recurrent nova T CrB has entered in 2015 a phase of unprecedented high\nactivity. To trace something equivalent, it is necessary to go back to 1938,\nbefore the last nova eruption in 1946. The 2015 super-active state is\ncharacterized by: a large increase in the mean brightness (Delta B =0.72 mag\nover the uderlying secular trend), vanishing of the orbital modulation from the\nB-band lightcurve, and appearance of strong and high ionization emission lines,\non top of a nebular continuum that overwhelms at optical wavelengths the\nabsoption spectrum of the M giant. Among the emission lines, HeII 4686 attains\na flux in excess of Hgamma, the full set of OIII and NIII lines involved in the\nBowen fluorescence mechanism are strong and varying in intensity in phase with\nHeII 4686, and OIV and [NeV] are present. A large increase in the radiation\noutput from the hot source is reponsible for a large expansion in the ionized\nfraction of the M giant wind. The wind is completely ionized in the direction\nto the observer. A high electron density is supported by the weakness of\nforbidden lines and by the large amplitude and short time scale of the\nreprocessing by the nebular material of the highly variable photo-ionization\ninput from the hot source. During the super-active state the nebula is varying\nto and from ionization-bounded and density-bounded conditions, and the\naugmented irradiation of the cool giant has changed the spectral type of its\nside facing the hot source from M3III to M2III, i.e. an increase of ~80 K in\neffective temperature.\n", "  We present a survey for transient and variable sources, on timescales from 28\nseconds to $\\sim$1 year, using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) at 182 MHz.\nDown to a detection threshold of 0.285 Jy, no transient candidates were\nidentified, making this the most constraining low-frequency survey to date and\nplacing a limit on the surface density of transients of $<4.1 \\times 10^{-7}$\ndeg$^{-2}$ for the shortest timescale considered. At these frequencies,\nemission from Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) is expected to be detectable in the\nshortest timescale images without any corrections for interstellar or\nintergalactic dispersion. At an FRB limiting flux density of 7980 Jy, we find a\nrate of $<$82 FRBs per sky per day for dispersion measures $<$700 pc cm$^{-3}$.\nAssuming a cosmological population of standard candles, our rate limits are\nconsistent with the FRB rates obtained by Thornton et al. (2013) if they have a\nflat spectral slope. Finally, we conduct an initial variability survey of\nsources in the field with flux densities $\\gtrsim$0.5 Jy and identify no\nsources with significant variability in their lightcurves. However, we note\nthat substantial further work is required to fully characterise both the short\nterm and low level variability within this field.\n", "  Transition disks (TDs) are intermediate stage circumstellar disks\ncharacterized by an inner gap within the disk structure. To test whether these\ngaps may have been formed by closely orbiting, previously undetected stellar\ncompanions, we collected high-resolution optical spectra of 31 TD objects to\nsearch for spectroscopic binaries (SBs). Twenty-four of these objects are in\nOphiuchus and seven are within the Coronet, Corona Australis, and Chameleon I\nstar-forming regions. We measured radial velocities for multiple epochs,\nobtaining a median precision of 400 ms$^{-1}$. We identified double-lined SB\nSSTc2d J163154.7-250324 in Ophiuchus, which we determined to be composed of a\nK7($\\pm$0.5) and a K9($\\pm$0.5) star, with orbital limits of $a<$0.6 AU and\n$P<$150 days. This results in an SB fraction of 0.04$^{+0.12}_{-0.03}$ in\nOphiuchus, which is consistent with other spectroscopic surveys of non-TD\nobjects in the region. This similarity suggests that TDs are not preferentially\nsculpted by the presence of close binaries and that planet formation around\nclose binaries may take place over similar timescales to that around single\nstars.\n", "  The nature of the main sulphur reservoir in star forming regions is a long\nstanding mystery. The observed abundance of sulphur-bearing species in dense\nclouds is only about 0.1 per cent of the same quantity in diffuse clouds.\nTherefore, the main sulphur species in star forming regions of the interstellar\nmedium are still unknown. IRAS 16293-2422 is one of the regions where\nproduction of S-bearing species is favourable due to its conditions which\nallows the evaporation of ice mantles. We carried out observations in the 3 mm\nband towards the solar type protostar IRAS 16293-2422 with the IRAM 30m\ntelescope. We observed a single frequency setup with the EMIR heterodyne 3 mm\nreceiver with an Lower Inner (LI) tuning frequency of 89.98 GHz. Several lines\nof the complex sulphur species CH3SH were detected. Observed abundances are\ncompared with simulations using the NAUTILUS gas-grain chemical model.\nModelling results suggest that CH3SH has the constant abundance of 4e-9\n(compared to H2) for radii lower than 200 AU and is mostly formed on the\nsurfaces. Detection of CH3SH indicates that there may be several new families\nof S-bearing molecules (which could form starting from CH3SH) which have not\nbeen detected or looked for yet.\n", "  We probe the spatial distribution of outflowing gas along four lines of sight\nseparated by up to 6 kpc in a gravitationally-lensed star-forming galaxy at\nz=1.70. Using MgII and FeII emission and absorption as tracers, we find that\nthe clumps of star formation are driving galactic outflows with velocities of\n-170 to -250 km/sec. The velocities of MgII emission are redshifted with\nrespect to the systemic velocities of the galaxy, consistent with being\nback-scattered. By contrast, the FeII fluorescent emission lines are either\nslightly blueshifted or at the systemic velocity of the galaxy. Taken together,\nthe velocity structure of the MgII and FeII emission is consistent with arising\nthrough scattering in galactic winds. Assuming a thin shell geometry for the\nout owing gas, the estimated masses carried out by these outfows are large (>\n30 - 50 $\\rm{M_{\\odot} yr^{-1}}$), with mass loading factors several times the\nstar-formation rate. Almost 20% to 50% of the blueshifted absorption probably\nescapes the gravitational potential of the galaxy. In this galaxy, the outflow\nis \"locally sourced\", that is, the properties of the outflow in each line of\nsight are dominated by the properties of the nearest clump of star formation;\nthe wind is not global to the galaxy. The mass outflow rates and the momentum\nflux carried out by outflows in individual star forming knots of this object\nare comparable to that of starburst galaxies in the local Universe.\n", "  We describe DSiD, a fast simulation Delphes detector for the International\nLinear Collider (ILC) based on the full simulation performance of the SiD\ndetector. SiD is one of two detectors described in the ILC Technical Design\nReport (TDR). The tracking efficiency, tracking momentum resolution,\nelectromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter energy resolution, particle\nidentification and flavor tagging efficiencies are taken from the Detailed\nBaseline Design (DBD) study as described in ILC TDR Volume 4: Detectors. In a\ncross-check study with $4 \\times 10^6$ $e^+ e^- \\rightarrow b \\bar{b}$ events\ngenerated at $\\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV and simulated by Delphes with the DSiD detector\ncard, these performance characteristics are measured and found to be\ncommensurate with the DBD results. For a new physics use case example, we\ndescribe a study of Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric $e^+ e^- \\rightarrow 2\n\\chi_3 \\rightarrow 2\\chi_1 2 h_1$ with $h_1 \\rightarrow 2a_1$ or $h_1\n\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ at the $\\sqrt{s}=500$ GeV ILC. The card is available on\nHepForge.\n", "  Theoretical modelling of the evolution of classical and recurrent novae plays\nan important role in studies of binary evolution, nucleosynthesis and accretion\nphysics. However, from a theoretical perspective the observed statistical\nproperties of novae remain poorly understood. In this paper, we have produced\nmodel populations of novae using a hybrid binary population synthesis approach\nfor differing star formation histories (SFHs): a starburst case\n(elliptical-like galaxies), a constant star formation rate case (spiral-like\ngalaxies) and a composite case (in line with the inferred SFH for M31). We\nfound that the nova rate at 10\\;Gyr in an elliptical-like galaxy is $\\sim\n10-20$ times smaller than a spiral-like galaxy with the same mass. The majority\nof novae in elliptical-like galaxies at the present epoch are characterized by\nlow mass white dwarfs (WDs), long decay times, relatively faint absolute\nmagnitudes and long recurrence periods. In contrast, the majority of novae in\nspiral-like galaxies at 10\\;Gyr have massive WDs, short decay times, are\nrelatively bright and have short recurrence periods. The mass loss time\ndistribution for novae in our M31-like galaxy is in agreement with\nobservational data for Andromeda. However, it is possible that we underestimate\nthe number of bright novae in our model. This may arise in part due to the\npresent uncertainties in the appropriate bolometric correction for novae.\n", "  The extreme luminosities of hot, massive stars drive strong stellar winds\nthrough UV line-scattering. For OB stars with an orbiting circumstellar disk,\nwe explore the effect of such line-scattering in ablating disk material,\ninitially focusing on the marginally optically thin decretion disks of\nclassical Oe and Be stars. For this we apply a multi-dimensional\nradiation-hydrodynamics code, assuming optically thin ray tracing for the\nstellar continuum and a multi-ray Sobolev treatment of the line transfer. This\naccounts for desaturation of line-absorption by Keplerian shear in the disk,\nand associated driving by non-radial photons. Results show dense,\nintermediate-speed surface ablation, consistent with the strong, blue-shifted\nabsorption seen in UV wind lines of Be shell stars. The asymptotic ablation\nrate is typically an order-unity factor times the stellar wind mass loss rate,\nleading to disk destruction times of order months to years for Be disks,\nconsistent with observations. The much stronger radiative forces of O stars\nreduce this time to order days, making sustaining a disk difficult, and so\nproviding a natural explanation for the rarity of Galactic Oe stars.\nAdditionally, the weakened line-driving at lower metallicity implies both a\nreduction in the winds that help spin-down stars from near-critical rotation,\nand in the ablation of decretion disks, thus providing a natural explanation\nfor the higher fraction of Classical Be stars, and the presence of Oe stars, in\nthe Magellanic Clouds. We conclude with a discussion of future extensions to\nstudy line-driven ablation of denser, optically thick, accretion disks around\npre-main-sequence massive stars.\n", "  Aims. We investigate the environmental dependence of the stellar mass\nfundamental plane (FP$_*$) using the early-type galaxy sample from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7).\n  Methods. The FP$_*$ is calculated by replacing the luminosity in the\nfundamental plane (FP) with stellar mass. Based on the SDSS group catalog, we\ncharacterize the galaxy environment according to the mass of the host dark\nmatter halo and the position in the halo. In halos with the same mass bin, the\ncolor distributions of central and satellite galaxies are different. Therefore,\nwe calculate FP$_*$ coefficients of galaxies in different environments and\ncompare them with those of the FP to study the contribution of the stellar\npopulation.\n  Results. We find that coefficient $a$ of the FP$_*$ is systematically larger\nthan that of the FP, but coefficient $b$ of the FP$_*$ is similar to the FP.\nMoreover, the environmental dependence of the FP$_*$ is similar to that of the\nFP. For central galaxies, FP$_*$ coefficients are significantly dependent on\nthe halo mass. For satellite galaxies, the correlation between FP$_*$\ncoefficients and the halo mass is weak.\n  Conclusions. We conclude that the tilt of the FP is not primarily driven by\nthe stellar population.\n", "  We introduce Zurich Atmosphere Purge (ZAP), an approach to sky subtraction\nbased on principal component analysis (PCA) that we have developed for the\nMulti Unit Spectrographic Explorer (MUSE) integral field spectrograph. ZAP\nemploys filtering and data segmentation to enhance the inherent capabilities of\nPCA for sky subtraction. Extensive testing shows that ZAP reduces sky emission\nresiduals while robustly preserving the flux and line shapes of astronomical\nsources. The method works in a variety of observational situations from sparse\nfields with a low density of sources to filled fields in which the target\nsource fills the field of view. With the inclusion of both of these situations\nthe method is generally applicable to many different science cases and should\nalso be useful for other instrumentation. ZAP is available for download at\nhttp://muse-vlt.eu/science/tools.\n", "  The Leigh-Strassler family of N=1 marginal deformations of the N=4 SYM theory\nadmits a Hopf algebra symmetry which is a quantum group deformation of the\nSU(3) part of the R-symmetry of the Ncal=4 theory. We investigate how this\nquantum symmetry might be expressed on the gravity side of the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. First, we discuss the twist leading to the Hopf algebra\nstructure for the well-known beta-deformation as well as a unitarily equivalent\ntheory that we call the w-deformation. We then show how this Hopf twist can be\nused to define a star product between the three scalar superfields of these\ntheories which encodes the deformed global symmetry. Turning to the gravity\nside, we adapt this star product to deform the pure spinors of six-dimensional\nflat space in its generalised geometry description. This leads to an N=2 NS-NS\nsolution of IIB supergravity. Starting from this precursor solution, adding\nD3-branes and taking the near-horizon limit reproduces the dual gravitational\nsolution to the above theories, first derived by Lunin and Maldacena using TsT\ntechniques. This indicates that the Hopf algebra symmetry can play a useful\nrole in constructing the supergravity duals of the general Leigh-Strassler\ndeformations.\n", "  Calcium-rich supernovae represent a significant challenge for our\nunderstanding of the fates of stellar systems. They are less luminous than\nother supernova (SN) types and they evolve more rapidly to reveal nebular\nspectra dominated by strong calcium lines with weak or absent signatures of\nother intermediate- and iron-group elements, which are seen in other SNe.\nStrikingly, their explosion sites also mark them out as distinct from other SN\ntypes. Their galactocentric offset distribution is strongly skewed to very\nlarge offsets (around one third are offset greater than 20 kpc), meaning they\ndo not trace the stellar light of their hosts. Many of the suggestions to\nexplain this extreme offset distribution have invoked the necessity for unusual\nformation sites such as globular clusters or dwarf satellite galaxies, which\nare therefore difficult to detect. Building on previous work attempting to\ndetect host systems of nearby Ca-rich SNe, we here present Hubble Space\nTelescope imaging of 5 members of the class - 3 exhibiting large offsets and 2\ncoincident with the disk of their hosts. We find no underlying sources at the\nexplosion sites of any of our sample. Combining with previous work, the lack of\na host system now appears to be a ubiquitous feature amongst Ca-rich SNe. In\nthis case the offset distribution is most readily explained as a signature of\nhigh-velocity progenitor systems that have travelled significant distances\nbefore exploding.\n", "  Superclusters are the largest relatively isolated systems in the cosmic web.\nUsing the SDSS BOSS survey we search for the largest superclusters in the\nredshift range $0.43<z<0.71$.\n  We generate a luminosity-density field smoothed over $8 h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$\nto detect the large-scale over-density regions. Each individual over-density\nregion is defined as single supercluster in the survey. We define the\nsuperclusters in the way that they are comparable with the superclusters found\nin the SDSS main survey.\n  We found a system we call the BOSS Great Wall (BGW), which consists of two\nwalls with diameters 186 and 173 $h^{-1}$Mpc, and two other major superclusters\nwith diameters of 64 and 91 $h^{-1}$Mpc. As a whole, this system consists of\n830 galaxies with the mean redshift 0.47. We estimate the total mass to be\napproximately $2\\times10^{17}h^{-1}M_\\odot$. The morphology of the\nsuperclusters in the BGW system is similar to the morphology of the\nsuperclusters in the Sloan Great Wall region.\n  The BGW is one of the most extended and massive system of superclusters yet\nfound in the Universe.\n", "  The magnetoelectric (ME) effects are investigated in a cubic compound\nSrCuTe2O6, in which uniform Cu2+ (S=1/2) spin chains with considerable spin\nfrustration exhibit a concomitant antiferromagnetic transition and dielectric\nconstant peak at TN=5.5 K. Pyroelectric Jp(T) and magnetoelectric current\nJME(H) measurements in the presence of a bias electric field are used to reveal\nthat SrCuTe2O6 shows clear variations of Jp(T) across TN at constant magnetic\nfields. Furthermore, isothermal measurements of JME(H) also develop clear peaks\nat finite magnetic fields, of which traces are consistent with the spin-flop\ntransitions observed in the magnetization studies. As a result, the anomalies\nobserved in Jp(T) and JME(H) curves well match with the field-temperature phase\ndiagram constructed from magnetization and dielectric constant measurements,\ndemonstrating that SrCuTe2O6 is a new magnetoelectric compound with S=1/2 spin\nchains.\n", "  With ALMA making it possible to resolve giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in\nother galaxies, it is becoming necessary to quantify the observational bias on\nmeasured GMC properties. Using a hydrodynamical simulation of a barred spiral\ngalaxy, we compared the physical properties of GMCs formed in\nposition-position-position space (PPP) to the observational\nposition-position-velocity space (PPV). We assessed the effect of disc\ninclination: face-on (PPV_face) and edge-on (PPV_edge), and resolution: 1.5 pc\nversus 24 pc, on GMC properties and the further implications of using Larson's\nscaling relations for mass-radius and velocity dispersion-radius. The\nlow-resolution PPV data are generated by simulating ALMA Cycle 3 observations\nusing the CASA package. Results show that the median properties do not differ\nstrongly between PPP and PPV_face under both resolutions, but PPV_edge clouds\ndeviate from these two. The differences become magnified when switching to the\nlower, but more realistic resolution. The discrepancy can lead to opposite\nresults for the virial parameter's measure of gravitational binding, and\ntherefore the dynamical state of the clouds. The power-law indices for the two\nLarson's scaling relations decrease going from PPP, PPV_face to PPV_edge and\ndecrease from high to low resolutions. We conclude that the relations are not\nentirely driven by the underlying physical origin and therefore have to be used\nwith caution when considering the environmental dependence, dynamical state,\nand the extragalactic CO-to-H2 conversion factor of GMCs.\n", "  The determination of the redshift of extragalactic gamma ray sources is of\nfundamental importance for the interpretation of their emission models and\nextragalactic population studies, AGN classification schemes, and to study the\ninteraction with the extragalactic background light. Here we focus on the BL\nLac S2 0109+22, recently detected at very high energies. We obtained a high\nsignal-to-noise optical spectrum at Gran Telescopio Canarias for the source\nover the spectral range 4000-10000 Angstrom, to search for spectral features of\nthe host galaxy and/or of the nuclear source and it was compared with previous\nobservations in order to confirm and/or dispute its redshift determination. We\nfind the S2 0109+22 optical spectrum is well represented by a power law\ncontinuum without any absorption or emission feature of Equivalent Width >0.1\nAngstrom. Based on the new optical spectrum we are able to set a redshift lower\nlimit z>0.35, assuming the source is hosted by a massive elliptical galaxy\ntypical for this class of sources. The redshift z=0.265 proposed in the\nliterature for this object is most probably referred to a r=18.3 galaxy at 15\"\nfrom S2 0109. This galaxy could belong to a group of faint galaxies located at\nz~0.26.\n", "  We present integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy and self-consistent\nphotoionisation modelling for a sample of four southern Galactic planetary\nnebulae (PNe) with supposed weak emission-line (WEL) central stars. The Wide\nField Spectrograph (WiFeS) on the ANU 2.3 m telescope has been used to provide\nIFU spectroscopy for NGC 3211, NGC 5979, My 60, and M 4-2 covering the spectral\nrange of 3400-7000{\\AA}. All objects are high excitation non-Type I PNe, with\nstrong He II emission, strong [Ne V] emission, and weak low-excitation lines.\nThey all appear to be predominantly optically-thin nebulae excited by central\nstars with $T_{\\rm eff} > 10^5$K. Three PNe of the sample have central stars\nwhich have been previously classified as weak emission-line stars (WELS), and\nthe fourth also shows the characteristic recombination lines of a WELS.\nHowever, the spatially-resolved spectroscopy shows that rather than arising in\nthe central star, the C IV and N III recombination line emission is distributed\nin the nebula, and in some cases concentrated in discrete nebular knots. This\nmay suggest that the WELS classification is spurious, and that, rather, these\nlines arise from (possibly chemically enriched) pockets of nebular gas. Indeed,\nfrom careful background subtraction we were able to identify three of the\nsample as being hydrogen rich O(H)-Type. We have constructed fully\nself-consistent photoionization models for each object. This allows us to\nindependently determine the chemical abundances in the nebulae, to provide new\nmodel-dependent distance estimates, and to place the central stars on the H-R\ndiagram. All four PNe have similar initial mass ($1.5 < M/M_{\\odot} <2.0$) and\nare at a similar evolutionary stage.\n", "  In this paper we describe a stretchable solid-state electronic switching\nmaterial that operates at high voltage potentials, as well as a switch material\nbenchmarking technique that utilizes a modular dielectric elastomer (artificial\nmuscle) ring oscillator. The solid-state switching material was integrated into\nour oscillator, which self-started after 16s and performed 5 oscillations at a\nfrequency of 1.05Hz with 3.25kV DC input. Our materials-by-design approach for\nthe nickel filled polydimethysiloxane (Ni-PDMS) based switch has resulted in\nsignificant improvements over previous carbon-grease based switches in four key\nareas, namely sharpness of switching behavior upon applied stretch, magnitude\nof electrical resistance change, ease of manufacture, and rate of production.\nSwitch lifetime was demonstrated to be in the range of tens to hundreds of\ncycles with the current process. An interesting and potentially useful\nstrain-based switching hysteresis behavior is also presented.\n", "  Most hot Jupiters are expected to spiral in towards their host stars due to\ntransfering of the angular momentum of the orbital motion to the stellar spin.\nTheir orbits can also precess due to planet-star interactions. Calculations\nshow that both effects could be detected for the very-hot exoplanet WASP-12 b\nusing the method of precise transit timing over a timespan of the order of 10\nyr. We acquired new precise light curves for 29 transits of WASP-12 b,\nspannning 4 observing seasons from November 2012 to February 2016. New\nmid-transit times, together with literature ones, were used to refine the\ntransit ephemeris and analyse the timing residuals. We find that the transit\ntimes of WASP-12 b do not follow a linear ephemeris with a 5 sigma confidence\nlevel. They may be approximated with a quadratic ephemeris that gives a rate of\nchange in the orbital period of -2.56 +/- 0.40 x 10^{-2} s/yr. The tidal\nquality parameter of the host star was found to be equal to 2.5 x 10^5 that is\ncomparable to theoretical predictions for Sun-like stars. We also consider a\nmodel, in which the observed timing residuals are interpreted as a result of\nthe apsidal precession. We find, however, that this model is statistically less\nprobable than the orbital decay.\n", "  Being one of only two fundamental properties black holes possess, the spin of\nsupermassive black holes (SMBHs) is of great interest for understanding\naccretion processes and galaxy evolution. However, in these early days of spin\nmeasurements, consistency and reproducibility of spin constraints have been a\nchallenge. Here we focus on X-ray spectral modelling of active galactic nuclei\n(AGN), examining how well we can truly return known reflection parameters such\nas spin under standard conditions. We have created and fit over 4000 simulated\nSeyfert 1 spectra each with 375$\\pm$1k counts. We assess the fits with\nreflection fraction of $R$ = 1 as well as reflection-dominated AGN with $R$ =\n5. We also examine the consequence of permitting fits to search for retrograde\nspin. In general, we discover that most parameters are over-estimated when\nspectroscopy is restricted to the 2.5 - 10.0 keV regime and that models are\ninsensitive to inner emissivity index and ionization. When the bandpass is\nextended out to 70keV, parameters are more accurately estimated. Repeating the\nprocess for $R$ = 5 reduces our ability to measure photon index ($\\sim$3 to 8\nper cent error and overestimated), but increases precision in all other\nparameters -- most notably ionization, which becomes better constrained\n($\\pm$45 erg cm $\\rm{s^{-1}}$) for low ionization parameters ($\\xi$$<$200 erg\ncm $\\rm{s^{-1}}$). In all cases, we find the spin parameter is only well\nmeasured for the most rapidly rotating supermassive black holes (i.e. $a$ $>$\n0.8 to about $\\pm$0.10) and that inner emissivity index is never well\nconstrained. Allowing our model to search for retrograde spin did not improve\nthe results.\n", "  We know that planetary systems are just as common around white dwarfs as\naround main sequence stars. However, self-consistently linking a planetary\nsystem across these two phases of stellar evolution through the violent giant\nbranch poses computational challenges, and previous studies restricted\narchitectures to equal-mass planets. Here, we remove this constraint and\nperform over 450 numerical integrations over a Hubble time (14 Gyr) of packed\nplanetary systems with unequal-mass planets. We characterize the resulting\ntrends as a function of planet order and mass. We find that intrusive radial\nincursions in the vicinity of the white dwarf become less likely as the\ndispersion amongst planet masses increases. The orbital meandering which may\nsustain a sufficiently dynamic environment around a white dwarf to explain\nobservations is more dependent on the presence of terrestrial-mass planets than\nany variation in planetary mass. Triggering unpacking or instability during the\nwhite dwarf phase is comparably easy for systems of unequal-mass planets and\nsystems of equal-mass planets; instabilities during the giant branch phase\nremain rare and require fine-tuning of initial conditions. We list the key\ndynamical features of each simulation individually as a potential guide for\nupcoming discoveries.\n", "  New high-resolution r band imaging of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in\nAbell 85 (Holm 15A) was obtained using the Gemini Multi Object Spectrograph.\nThese data were taken with the aim of deriving an accurate surface brightness\nprofile of the BCG of Abell 85, in particular its central region. The new\nGemini data show clear evidence of a previously unreported nuclear emission\nthat is evident as a distinct light excess in the central kiloparsec of the\nsurface brightness profile. We find that the light profile is never flat nor\ndoes it present a downward trend towards the center of the galaxy. That is, the\nnew Gemini data show a different physical reality from the featureless,\n\"evacuated core\" recently claimed for the Abell 85 BCG. After trying different\nmodels, we find that the surface brightness profile of the BCG of Abell 85 is\nbest fit by a double Sersic model.\n", "  We report on the discovery of broad Balmer absorption lines variability in\nthe QSO SDSS J125942.80+121312.6, based on the optical and near-infrared\nspectra taken from the SDSS-I, SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey\n(BOSS), and TripleSpec observations over a timescale of 5.8 years in the QSO's\nrest-frame. The blueshifted absorption profile of H$\\beta$ shows a variation of\nmore than 5$\\sigma$ at a high velocity portion ($>3000\\ \\mathrm{km\\ s}^{-1}$)\nof the trough. We perform a detailed analysis for the physical conditions of\nthe absorber using Balmer lines as well as metastable He I and optical Fe II\nabsorptions ($\\lambda 4233$ from b$^4$P$_{5/2}$ level and $\\lambda 5169$ from\na$^6$S$_{5/2}$) at the same velocity. These Fe II lines are identified in the\nQSO spectra for the first time. According to the photoionization simulations,\nwe estimate a gas density of $n(\\mathrm{H})\\approx 10^{9.1}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\nand a column density of $N_{\\mathrm{col}}(\\mathrm{H})\\approx 10^{23}\\\n\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ for the BOSS data, but the model fails to predict the\nvariations of ionic column densities between the SDSS and BOSS observations if\nchanges in ionizing flux are assumed. We thus propose transverse motion of the\nabsorbing gas being the cause of the observed broad Balmer absorption line\nvariability. In fact, we find that the changes in covering factors of the\nabsorber can well-reproduce all of the observed variations. The absorber is\nestimated $\\sim 0.94$ pc away from the central engine, which is where the\noutflow likely experiences deceleration due to the collision with the\nsurrounding medium. This scheme is consistent with the argument that LoBAL QSOs\nmay represent the transition from obscured star-forming galaxies to classic\nQSOs.\n", "  Beyond Earth-like planets, moons can be habitable, too. No exomoons have been\nsecurely detected, but they could be extremely abundant. Young Jovian planets\ncan be as hot as late M stars, with effective temperatures of up to 2000 K.\nTransits of their moons might be detectable in their infrared photometric light\ncurves if the planets are sufficiently separated ($\\gtrsim10$ AU) from the\nstars to be directly imaged. The moons will be heated by radiation from their\nyoung planets and potentially by tidal friction. Although stellar illumination\nwill be weak beyond 5 AU, these alternative energy sources could liquify\nsurface water on exomoons for hundreds of Myr. A Mars-mass H$_2$O-rich moon\naround $\\beta$ Pic b would have a transit depth of $1.5\\times10^{-3}$, in reach\nof near-future technology.\n", "  We present a phase-coherent timing solution for PSR J1640-4631, a young 206\nms pulsar using X-ray timing observations taken with NuSTAR. Over this timing\ncampaign, we have measured the braking index of PSR J1640-4631 to be n =\n3.15+/-0.03. Using a series of simulations, we argue that this unusually high\nbraking index is not due to timing noise, but is intrinsic to the pulsar's\nspin-down. We cannot, however, rule out contamination due to an unseen glitch\nrecovery, although the recovery timescale would have to be longer than most yet\nobserved. If this braking index is eventually proven to be stable, it\ndemonstrates that pulsar braking indices greater than 3 are allowed in nature,\nhence other physical mechanisms such as mass or magnetic quadrupoles are\nimportant in pulsar spin-down. We also present a 3-sigma upper limit on the\npulsed flux at 1.4 GHz of 0.018 mJy.\n", "  Runaway O- and early B-type stars passing throughout the interstellar medium\nat supersonic velocities and characterized by strong stellar winds may produce\nbow shocks that can serve as particle acceleration sites. Previous theoretical\nmodels predict the production of high energy photons by non-thermal radiative\nprocesses, but their efficiency is still debated. We aim to test and explain\nthe possibility of emission from the bow shocks formed by runaway stars\ntraveling through the interstellar medium by using previous theoretical models.\nWe apply our model to AE Aurigae, the first reported star with an X-ray\ndetected bow shock, to BD+43 3654, in which the observations failed in\ndetecting high energy emission, and to the transition phase of a supergiant\nstar in the late stages of its life.From our analysis, we confirm that the\nX-ray emission from the bow shock produced by AE Aurigae can be explained by\ninverse Compton processes involving the infrared photons of the heated dust. We\nalso predict low high energy flux emission from the bow shock produced by BD+43\n3654, and the possibility of high energy emission from the bow shock formed by\na supergiant star during the transition phase from blue to red supergiant.Bow\nshock formed by different type of runaway stars are revealed as a new possible\nsource of high energy photons in our neighbourhood.\n", "  In order to identify the pairing symmetry with chirality, we study\nsite-selective NMR in chiral p-wave superconductors. We calculate local nuclear\nrelaxation rate 1/T_1 in the vortex lattice state by Eilenberger theory,\nincluding the applied magnetic field dependence. We find that 1/T_1 in the NMR\nresonance line shape is different between two chiral states\np_{pm}(=p_x{pm}ip_y), depending on whether the chirality is parallel or\nanti-parallel to the vorticity. Anomalous suppression of 1/T_1 occurs around\nthe vortex core in the chiral p_- wave due to the negative coherence term\ncoming from the odd-frequency s-wave Cooper pair induced around the vortex with\nMajorana state.\n", "  I present a highly biased and skewed summary of IAU Symposium 314, \"Young\nStars and Planets Near the Sun,\" held in Atlanta. This summary includes\ntakeaway thoughts about the rapidly evolving state of the field, as well as\ncrowd-sourced predictions for progress over the next ~10 years. We predict the\nelimination of 1-2 of the currently recognized young moving groups, the\naddition of 3 or more new moving groups within 100 pc, the continued lack of a\npredictive theory of stellar mass, robust measurements of the gas and dust\ncontent of circumstellar disks, and an ongoing struggle to achieve a consensus\ndefinition for a planet.\n", "  We introduce the stochastic Boltzmann equation (SBE) as an approach for\nexploring the spin dynamics of magnetic molecules coupled to a stochastic\nenvironment. The SBE is a time-evolution equation for the probability density\nof the spin density matrix of the system. This probability density is relevant\nto experiments which take measurements on single molecules, in which\nprobabilities of observing particular spin states (rather than ensemble\naverages) are of interest. By analogy with standard treatments of the regular\nBoltzmann equation, we propose a relaxation-time approximation for the SBE, and\nshow that solutions to the SBE under the relaxation-time approximation can be\nobtained by performing simple trajectory simulations for the case of a boson\ngas environment. Cases where the relaxation-time approximation are satisfied\ncan therefore be investigated by careful choice of the parameters for the boson\ngas environment, even if the actual environment is quite different from a boson\ngas. The application of the SBE approach is demonstrated through an\nillustrative example.\n", "  Two-dimensional lattices of chiral nanoholes in a plasmonic film with lattice\nconstants being slightly larger than light wavelength are proposed for\neffective control of polarization and spatial properties of light beams.\nEffective polarization conversion and strong circular dichroism in non-zero\ndiffraction orders in these chiral metafilms are demonstrated by\nelectromagnetic simulations. These interesting effects are found to result from\ninterplay between radiation pattern of single chiral nanohole and diffraction\npattern of the planar lattice, and can be manipulated by varying wavelength and\npolarization of incoming light as well as period of metastructure and\nrefractive indexes of substrate and overlayer. Therefore, this work offers a\nnovel paradigm for developing planar chiral metafilm-based optical devices with\ncontrollable polarization state, spatial orientation and intensity of outgoing\nlight.\n", "  The master equation for the reversible reaction A+A <--> 0 is considered in\nPoisson representation, where it is equivalent to a Langevin equation with\nimaginary noise for a complex stochastic variable \\phi. Such Langevin equations\nappear quite generally in field-theoretic treatments of reaction-diffusion\nproblems. For this example we study the probability flow in the complex \\phi\nplane both analytically and by simulation. We show that this flow has various\ncurious features that must be expected to occur similarly in other Langevin\nequations associated with reaction-diffusion problems.\n", "  In the present work we investigate the Hojman symmetry in FRW cosmology. In\nparticular, we use the Hojman symmetry to find conserved quantities of\nparticular cosmological models. Next, we study the Hojman symmetry in the\nscalar-tensor cosmology and find corresponding exact forms of integrals of\nmotion. Finally, the formalism of the Hojman symmetry is extended to dynamical\nsystems with the higher-order equations of motion.\n", "  The X-ray emission of $\\eta$ Carinae shows multiple features at various\nspatial and temporal scales. The central constant emission (CCE) component is\ncentred on the binary and arises from spatial scales much smaller than the\nbipolar Homunculus nebula, but likely larger than the central wind--wind\ncollision region between the stars as it does not vary over the $\\sim$2-3 month\nX-ray minimum when it can be observed. Using large-scale 3D smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, we model both the colliding-wind region\nbetween the stars, and the region where the secondary wind collides with\nprimary wind ejected from the previous periastron passage. The simulations\nextend out to one hundred semimajor axes and make two limiting assumptions\n(strong coupling and no coupling) about the influence of the primary radiation\nfield on the secondary wind. We perform 3D radiative transfer calculations on\nthe SPH output to synthesize the X-ray emission, with the aim of reproducing\nthe CCE spectrum. For the preferred primary mass-loss rate\n$\\dot{M}_A\\approx8.5\\times10^{-4}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, the model spectra well\nreproduce the observation as the strong- and no-coupling spectra bound the CCE\nobservation for longitude of periastron $\\omega\\approx252^\\circ$, and\nbound/converge on the observation for $\\omega\\approx90^\\circ$. This suggests\nthat $\\eta$ Carinae has moderate coupling between the primary radiation and\nsecondary wind, that both the region between the stars and the comoving\ncollision on the backside of the secondary generate the CCE, and that the CCE\ncannot place constraints on the binary's line of sight. We also discuss\ncomparisons with common X-ray fitting parameters.\n", "  A density matrix based analytical model is developed to study the coherent\nprobe field propagation through a four-level V type system in presence of a\ncoherent control field. The model allows coupling of the probe field from the\nupper ground level to both of the excited levels keeping the control field\nlocked to a particular transition. The addition of an extra ground level to a\nconventional three-level V type system creates extra decay paths to the ground\nlevels for the upper level population. A set of sixteen density matrix based\nequations are formed and then solved analytically under rotating wave\napproximation to study the probe response under steady state condition. The\nsimulated probe absorption spectra shows absorption dip at the centre of a\ntransparency window only under Doppler broadened condition although the\nconventional EIT window appears under Doppler free condition. The dependence of\nthe field induced absorption signal on the Rabi frequency of the control field,\npopulation transfer rate among the ground levels and temperature of the vapour\nmedium has been studied in details.\n", "  We examine a thick accretion disc in the presence of external gravity and\nintrinsic dipolar magnetic field due to a non-rotating central object. In this\npaper, we generalize the Newtonian theory of stationary axisymmetric resistive\ntori of Tripathy, Prasanna $\\&$ Das (1990) by including the fully general\nrelativistic features. If we are to obtain the steady state configuration, we\nhave to take into account the finite resistivity for the magnetofluid in order\nto avoid the piling up of the field lines anywhere in the accretion discs. The\nefficient value of conductivity must be much smaller than the classical\nconductivity to be astrophysically interesting. The accreting plasma in the\npresence of an external dipole magnetic field gives rise to a current in the\nazimuthal direction. The azimuthal current produced due to the motion of the\nmagnetofluid modifies the magnetic field structure inside the disc and\ngenerates a poloidal magnetic field for the disc. The solutions we have found\nshow that the radial inflow, pressure and density distributions are strongly\nmodified by the electrical conductivity both in relativistic and Newtonian\nregimes. However, the range of conductivity coefficient is different for both\nregimes, as well as that of the angular momentum parameter and the radius of\nthe innermost stable circular orbit. Furthermore, it is shown that the\nazimuthal velocity of the disc which is not dependent on conductivity is\nsub-Keplerian in all radial distances for both regimes. Owing to the presence\nof pressure gradient and magnetic forces. This work may also be important for\nthe general relativistic computational magnetohydrodynamics that suffers from\nthe lack of exact analytic solutions that are needed to test computer codes.\n", "  $C_2$ cofiniteness and rationality of $V_{L_2}^{S_4}$ are obtained, and\nirreducible $V_{L_2}^{S_4}$-modules are classified. With the assumption of\nrationality and $C_2$ cofiniteness, irreducible $V_{L_2}^{A_5}$-modules are\ndetermined. Also, quantum dimensions of these irreducible modules are\ncalculated.\n", "  Opinion evolution mechanism can be captured by physics modeling approaches.\nIn this context, a kinetic equation is established by defining a generalized\ndisplace (cognitive-level), a driving force and the related generalized\npotential, information quantity, altitude. It has been shown that the details\nof opinion evolution depends the type of the driving force, self-dominated\ndriving or environment- dominated driving. In the former case, the participants\ncan have their altitudes changed in the process of competition between the\nself-driving force and environment-driving force. In the latter case, all of\nthe participants are pulled by the environment. Some regularity behind the\ndynamics of opinion is also revealed, for instance, the information entropy\ndecays with time in a special way, etc. the results may help us to get some\ndeep understandings to formation of a public opinion.\n", "  Since the seminal work of Emmy Noether it is well know that all conservations\nlaws in physics, \\textrm{e.g.}, conservation of energy or conservation of\nmomentum, are directly related to the invariance of the action under a family\nof transformations. However, the classical Noether's theorem can not yields\ninformations about constants of motion for non-conservative systems since it is\nnot possible to formulate physically meaningful Lagragians for this kind of\nsystems in classical calculus of variation. On the other hand, in recent years\nthe fractional calculus of variation within Lagrangians depending on fractional\nderivatives has emerged as an elegant alternative to study non-conservative\nsystems. In the present work, we obtained a generalization of the Noether's\ntheorem for Lagrangians depending on mixed classical and Caputo derivatives\nthat can be used to obtain constants of motion for dissipative systems. In\naddition, we also obtained Noether's conditions for the fractional optimal\ncontrol problem.\n", "  It has been shown in a companion paper that the late time acceleration of the\nuniverse can be accounted for by an extension of the QCD color to a $SU(3)$\ninvisible sector (IQCD). In this work we discuss a unified framework such the\nscale of dark chiral-breaking dictates both the accelerated expansion of the\nuniverse, and the origin of dark matter. We find that the strong and\ngravitational dynamics of dark quarks and gluons evolve to eventually form\nexotic dark stars. We discuss the dynamical complexity of these dark compact\nobjects in light of dark big bang nucleosynthesis. We argue how IQCD favors a\nhalo composed of very compact dark neutron stars, strange/quark stars and black\nholes, with masses $M_{MACHO}< 10^{-7}M_{\\odot}$. This avoids limit from MACHO\nand EROS collaborations as well as limit from clusters. We also discuss\npossible phenomenological implications in dark matter searches. We argue that\ndark supernovae and dark binaries can emit very peculiar gravitational waves\nsignal testable by the LIGO/VIRGO collaboration and future projects dedicated\nto these aspects.\n", "  The Square Kilometre Array will revolutionize pulsar studies with its wide\nfield-of-view, wide-band observation and high sensitivity, increasing the\nnumber of observable pulsars by more than an order of magnitude. Pulsars are of\ninterest not only for the study of neutron stars themselves but for their usage\nas tools for probing fundamental physics such as general relativity,\ngravitational waves and nuclear interaction. In this article, we summarize the\nactivity and interests of SKA-Japan Pulsar Science Working Group, focusing on\nan investigation of modified gravity theory with the supermassive black hole in\nthe Galactic Centre, gravitational-wave detection from cosmic strings and\nbinary supermassive black holes, a study of the physical state of plasma close\nto pulsars using giant radio pulses and determination of magnetic field\nstructure of Galaxy with pulsar pairs.\n", "  In this paper we have considered a simple lattice gas model of chemisorbed\nmonolayer which allows for the harmonic fluctuations of the bond length between\nthe adsorbate atom and the surface site. The model also involves a short-ranged\nattractive potential acting between the adsorbed atoms as well as the surface\nperiodic corrugation potential. It has been assumed that the adsorbed atoms are\nbonded to the uppermost layer of the substrate atoms. In particular, using\nMonte Carlo simulation method we have focused on the orderings appearing in the\ndense monolayer formed on the (111) face of an fcc solid. Within the lattice\ngas limit, the chemisorbed layer forms a (1x1) structure. On the other hand,\nwhen the bonds are allowed to fluctuate, three other different ordered phases\nhave been found to be stable in the ground state. One of them has been found to\nbe stable at finite temperatures and to undergo a phase transition to the\ndisordered state. The remaining two ordered states have been found to be stable\nin the ground state only. At finite temperatures, the ordering has been\ndemonstrated to be destroyed due to large entropic effects.\n", "  It is proposed to upgrade the endcap time-of-flight (ETOF) of the Beijing\nSpectrometer III (BESIII) with multi-gap resistive plate chamber (MRPC), aiming\nat overall time resolution about 80 ps. After the entire electronics system is\nready, some experiments, such as heat radiating, irradiation hardness and\nlarge-current beam tests,are carried out to certify the electronics'\nreliability and stability. The on-detector test of the electronics is also\nperformed with the beam at BEPCII E3 line, the test results indicate that the\nelectronics system fulfills its design requirements.\n", "  Electrodynamic responses from three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators\n(TIs) are characterized by the universal magnetoelectric $E\\cdot B$ term\nconstituent of the Lagrangian formalism. The quantized magnetoelectric\ncoupling, which is generally referred to as topological magnetoelectric (TME)\neffect, has been predicted to induce exotic phenomena including the universal\nlow-energy magneto-optical effects. Here we report the experimental\ndemonstration of the long-sought TME effect, which is exemplified by\nmagneto-optical Faraday and Kerr rotations in the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH)\nstates of magnetic TI surfaces by terahertz magneto-optics. The universal\nrelation composed of the observed Faraday and Kerr rotation angles but not of\nany material parameters (e.g. dielectric constant and magnetic susceptibility)\nwell exhibits the trajectory toward the fine structure constant $\\alpha$ $(=\n2\\pi e^2/hc \\sim 1/137)$ in the quantized limit. Our result will pave a way for\nversatile TME effects with emergent topological functions.\n", "  Molecular dynamics simulations to study the behaviour of anionic (Sodium\nDodecylsulfate, SDS) and nonionic (Monooleate of Sorbitan, SPAN80) surfactants\nclose to a SiO$_{2}$ (silicon dioxide) surface were carried out. Simulations\nshowed that a water layer was first adsorbed on the surface and then the\nsurfactants were attached on that layer. Moreover, it was observed that water\nbehaviour close to the surface influenced the surfactant adsorption since a\nsemi-spherical micelle was formed on the SiO$_{2}$ surface with SDS molecules\nwhereas a cylindrical micelle was formed with SPAN80 molecules. Adsorption of\nthe micelles was conducted in terms of structural properties (density profiles\nand angular distributions) and dynamical behaviour (diffusion coefficients) of\nthe systems. Finally, it was also shown that some water molecules moved inside\nthe solid surface and located at specific sites of the solid surface.\n", "  Genes and proteins regulate cellular functions through complex circuits of\nbiochemical reactions. Fluctuations in the components of these regulatory\nnetworks result in noise that invariably corrupts the signal, possibly\ncompromising function. Here, we create a practical formalism based on ideas\nintroduced by Wiener and Kolmogorov (WK) for filtering noise in engineered\ncommunications systems to quantitatively assess the extent to which noise can\nbe controlled in biological processes involving negative feedback. Application\nof the theory, which reproduces the previously proven scaling of the lower\nbound for noise suppression in terms of the number of signaling events, shows\nthat a tetracycline repressor-based negative-regulatory gene circuit behaves as\na WK filter. For the class of Hill-like nonlinear regulatory functions, this\ntype of filter provides the optimal reduction in noise. Our theoretical\napproach can be readily combined with experimental measurements of response\nfunctions in a wide variety of genetic circuits, to elucidate the general\nprinciples by which biological networks minimize noise.\n", "  We show that, as it happens in graphene, elastic deformations couple to the\nelectronic degrees of freedom as pseudo gauge fields in Weyl semimetals. We\nderive the form of the elastic gauge fields in a tight-binding model hosting\nWeyl nodes and see that this vector electron-phonon coupling is chiral,\nproviding an example of axial gauge fields in three dimensions. As an example\nof the new response functions that arise associated to these elastic gauge\nfields, we derive a non-zero phonon Hall viscosity for the neutral system at\nzero temperature. The axial nature of the fields provides a test of the chiral\nanomaly in high energy with three axial vector couplings.\n", "  We consider formation of accretion disks from a realistically turbulent\nmolecular gas using 3D MHD simulations. In particular, we analyze the effect of\nthe fast turbulent reconnection described by the Lazarian & Vishniac (1999)\nmodel for the removal of magnetic flux from a disk. With our numerical\nsimulations we demonstrate how the fast reconnection enables protostellar disk\nformation resolving the so-called \"magnetic braking catastrophe\". In\nparticular, we provide a detailed study of the dynamics of a 0.5 M$_\\odot$\nprotostar and the formation of its disk for up to several thousands years. We\nmeasure the evolution of the mass, angular momentum, magnetic field, and\nturbulence around the star. We consider effects of two processes that strongly\naffect the magnetic transfer of angular momentum, both of which are based on\nturbulent reconnection: the first, \"reconnection diffusion\", removes the\nmagnetic flux from the disk, the other involves the change of the magnetic\nfield's topology, but does not change the absolute value of the magnetic flux\nthrough the disk. We demonstrate that for the first mechanism, turbulence\ncauses a magnetic flux transport outward from the inner disk to the ambient\nmedium, thus decreasing the coupling of the disk to the ambient material. A\nsimilar effect is achieved through the change of the magnetic field's topology\nfrom a split monopole configuration to a dipole configuration. We explore how\nboth mechanisms prevent the catastrophic loss of disk angular momentum and\ncompare both above turbulent reconnection mechanisms with alternative\nmechanisms from the literature.\n", "  The magnetotransport of highly mobile 2D electrons in wide GaAs single\nquantum wells with three populated subbands placed in titled magnetic fields is\nstudied. The bottoms of the lower two subbands have nearly the same energy\nwhile the bottom of the third subband has a much higher energy ($E_1\\approx\nE_2<<E_3$). At zero in-plane magnetic fields magneto-intersubband oscillations\n(MISO) between the $i^{th}$ and $j^{th}$ subbands are observed and obey the\nrelation $\\Delta_{ij}=E_j-E_i=k\\cdot\\hbar\\omega_c$, where $\\omega_c$ is the\ncyclotron frequency and $k$ is an integer. An application of in-plane magnetic\nfield produces dramatic changes in MISO and the corresponding electron\nspectrum. Three regimes are identified. At $\\hbar\\omega_c \\ll \\Delta_{12}$ the\nin-plane magnetic field increases considerably the gap $\\Delta_{12}$, which is\nconsistent with the semi-classical regime of electron propagation. In contrast\nat strong magnetic fields $\\hbar\\omega_c \\gg \\Delta_{12}$ relatively weak\noscillating variations of the electron spectrum with the in-plane magnetic\nfield are observed. At $\\hbar\\omega_c \\approx \\Delta_{12}$ the electron\nspectrum undergoes a transition between these two regimes through magnetic\nbreakdown. In this transition regime MISO with odd quantum number $k$\nterminate, while MISO corresponding to even $k$ evolve $continuously$ into the\nhigh field regime corresponding to $\\hbar\\omega_c \\gg \\Delta_{12}$\n", "  In this paper we have enlightened the spin related issues of tilted Electron\nvortex beams. We have shown that in the skyrmionic model of electron we can\nhave the spin Hall current considering the tilted type of electron vortex beam.\nWe have considered the monopole charge of the tilted vortex as time dependent\nand through the time variation of the monopole charge we can explain the spin\nHall effect of electron vortex beams. Besides, with an external magnetic field\nwe can have a spin filter configuration.\n", "  We present a model-independent analysis of the short-timescale energy\ndependence of low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the X-ray\nflux of GRS 1915+105. The QPO frequency in this source has previously been\nobserved to depend on photon energy, with the frequency increasing with energy\nfor observations with a high ($\\gtrsim 2$ Hz) QPO frequency, and decreasing\nwith energy for observations with a low ($\\lesssim 2$ Hz) QPO frequency. As\nthis observed energy dependence is currently unexplained, we investigate if it\nis intrinsic to the QPO mechanism by tracking phase lags on (sub)second\ntimescales. We find that the phase lag between two broad energy bands\nsystematically increases for $5$ - $10$ QPO cycles, after which the QPO becomes\ndecoherent, the phase lag resets and the pattern repeats. This shows that the\nband with the higher QPO frequency is running away from the other band on short\ntimescales, providing strong evidence that the energy dependence of the QPO\nfrequency is intrinsic. We also find that the faster the QPO decoheres, the\nfaster the phase lag increases, suggesting that the intrinsic frequency\ndifference contributes to the decoherence of the QPO. We interpret our results\nwithin a simple geometric QPO model, where different radii in the inner\naccretion flow experience Lense-Thirring precession at different frequencies,\ncausing the decoherence of the oscillation. By varying the spectral shape of\nthe inner accretion flow as a function of radius, we are able to qualitatively\nexplain the energy-dependent behaviour of both QPO frequency and phase lag.\n", "  We apply Shubin's theory of global symbol classes $\\Gamma_{\\rho}^{m}$ to the\nBorn-Jordan pseudodifferential calculus we have previously developed. This\napproach has many conceptual advantages, and makes the relationship between the\nconflicting Born-Jordan and Weyl quantization methods much more limpid. We\ngive, in particular, precise asymptotic expansions of symbols allowing to pass\nfrom Born-Jordan quantization to Weyl quantization, and vice-versa. In addition\nwe state and prove some regularity and global hypoellipticity results.\n", "  This book includes my lectures, together with their problem sets and\nsolutions, on 1) classical mechanics (one semester), 2) thermodynamics and\nstatistical mechanics (one semester), and 3) quantum mechanics (one semester),\nwhich I have been giving to graduate students of theoretical physics at Annaba\nUniversity since 2010 .\n", "  The theory of general relativity, for which we celebrate the centennial at\nthis Symposium, is based on the Einstein equivalence principle. This principle\ncould be violated through a pseudoscalar-photon interaction, which would also\nproduce a rotation of the polarization angle for radiation traveling over very\nlong distances. Therefore, if we could show that this cosmic polarization\nrotation does not exist, our confindence in general relativity would be greatly\nincreased. We review here the astrophysical searches for cosmic polarization\nrotation, which have been made in the past 26 years using the polarization of\nradio galaxies and of the cosmic microwave background. So far no rotation has\nbeen detected within about 1 degree. We discuss current problems and future\nprospects for cosmic polarization rotation measurements.\n", "  Biomedical optical imaging has a possibility of a comprehensive diagnosis of\nthyroid cancer in conjunction with ultrasound imaging. For improvement of the\noptical imaging, this study develops a higher order scheme for solving the\ntime-dependent radiative transport equation (RTE) by use of the\nfinite-difference and discrete-ordinate methods. The accuracy and efficiency of\nthe developed scheme are examined by comparison with the analytical solutions\nof the RTE in homogeneous media. Then, the developed scheme is applied to\ndescribing photon migration in the human neck model. The numerical simulations\nshow complex behaviors of photon migration in the human neck model due to\nmultiple diffusive reflection near the trachea.\n", "  In this review paper we show how the Cherednik algebra of type\n$\\check{C_1}C_1$ appears naturally as quantisation of the group algebra of the\nmonodromy group associated to the sixth Painlev\\'e equation. This fact\nnaturally leads to an embedding of the Cherednik algebra of type\n$\\check{C_1}C_1$ into $Mat(2,\\mathbb T_q)$, i.e. $2\\times 2$ matrices with\nentries in the quantum torus. For $q=1$ this result is equivalent to say that\nthe Cherednik algebra of type $\\check{C_1}C_1$ is Azumaya of degree $2$\n\\cite{O}. By quantising the action of the braid group and of the Okamoto\ntransformations on the monodromy group associated to the sixth Painlev\\'e\nequation we study the automorphisms of the Cherednik algebra of type\n$\\check{C_1}C_1$ and conjecture the existence of a new automorphism. Inspired\nby the confluences of the Painlev\\'e equations, we produce similar embeddings\nfor the confluent Cherednik algebras $\\mathcal H_V,\\mathcal H_{IV},\\mathcal\nH_{III},\\mathcal H_{II}$ and $\\mathcal H_{I},$ defined in arXiv:1307.6140.\n", "  Quantum critical behavior has been associated with some of the most exotic\nemergent states of matter including high-temperature superconductivity. Much of\nthe research into quantum critical point (QCP) physics has been hampered by the\nlack of model systems simple enough to be analyzed by theory. Here, we show\nthat the concentrated solid solution fcc alloys, including the so-called\nhigh-entropy alloys, are ideal model systems to study the effects of chemical\ndisorder on emergent properties near a quantum critical region. The face\ncentered cubic (fcc) alloy NiCoCrx with x near 1 is found to be close to the Cr\nconcentration where the ferromagnetic transition temperature, Tc, goes to 0.\nNear this composition these alloys exhibit a resistivity linear in temperature\nto 2 K, a linear magnetoresistance, an excess -TlnT contribution to the low\ntemperature heat capacity and excess low temperature entropy. All of the low\ntemperature electrical, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the alloys\nwith compositions near x near 1 are not typical of a Fermi liquid and suggest\nstrong magnetic fluctuations associated with a quantum critical region. The\nlimit of extreme chemical disorder in these simple fcc materials thus provides\na novel and unique platform to study quantum critical behavior in a highly\ntunable system.\n", "  We propose an efficient finite-element analysis of the vector wave equation\nin a class of relatively general curved polygons. The proposed method is\nsuitable for an accurate and efficient calculation of the propagation constants\nof waveguides filled with pieces of homogeneous materials. To apply the method,\nwe first decompose the 2-D problem domain into a set of curved polygons of a\nspecific characteristic. Then we divide every polygon into a set of triangular\nelements with two straight edges. Finally, we introduce a set of hierarchical\nmixed-order curl-conforming vector basis functions inside every triangular\nelement to discretize the vector wave equation. The advantages of the method\nare as follows. The curved boundaries of the elements are modeled exactly and\nhence there is no approximation in the geometrical modeling. 2-D integrals of\nthe matrix elements are reduced to 1-D integrals. Therefore, the matrix filling\ncan be performed very fast. Total number of elements due to the discretization\nof a given domain is very small, and hence the discretization of the problem\ndomain takes up a very small percentage of the total computational time. We\nvalidate the method by comparing the results with those of Ansoft HFSS\nsimulator and investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the method through\nsome numerical examples.\n", "  The arrival of Albert Einstein in Argentina in 1925 had an impact, equally\nrelevant, on the scientific community and on the general public. In this paper\nwe discuss that visit from three different perspectives. Firstly, we consider\nthe conditions that allowed for such visit to be possible. Then we focus on the\ninstitutional actors that facilitated it, as well as on the expertise and\nwritten references on topics related to relativity theory circulating at the\ntime in the local community. In the last section we consider the implications\nof that visit for the local scientific environment.\n", "  Cardiac muscle tissue during relaxation is commonly modelled as a\nhyperelastic material with strongly nonlinear and anisotropic stress response.\nAdapting the behavior of such a model to experimental or patient data gives\nrise to a parameter estimation problem which involves a significant number of\nparameters. Gradient-based optimization algorithms provide a way to solve such\nnonlinear parameter estimation problems with relatively few iterations, but\nrequire the gradient of the objective functional with respect to the model\nparameters. This gradient has traditionally been obtained using finite\ndifferences, the calculation of which scales linearly with the number of model\nparameters, and introduces a differencing error. By using an automatically\nderived adjoint equation, we are able to calculate this gradient more\nefficiently, and with minimal implementation effort. We test this adjoint\nframework on a least squares fitting problem involving data from simple shear\ntests on cardiac tissue samples. A second challenge which arises in\ngradient-based optimization is the dependency of the algorithm on a suitable\ninitial guess. We show how a multi-start procedure can alleviate this\ndependency. Finally, we provide estimates for the material parameters of the\nHolzapfel and Ogden strain energy law using finite element models together with\nexperimental shear data.\n", "  The method of Direct Digital Drive is applied to a microring resonator. The\nmicroring resonator is thus controlled by a segmented set of electrodes each of\nwhich is driven by binary (digital) signal. Digital linearization is performed\nwith the aid of digital memory lookup table. The method is applied to a single\nmicroring modulator to provide an M-bit digital-toanalog converter (DAC), which\nmay also be viewed as an M-level pulse amplitude modulator (M-PAM). It is\nshown, by means of simulation, that a 4-bit DAC can achieve an effective number\nof bits (ENOB) of 3.74bits. Applying the same method for two rings, enables the\ngeneration of two-dimensional optical M-QAM signals. It is shown, by means of\nsimulation, that a 16-QAM modulator achieves an EVM better than -30dB.\n", "  Recent studies of heavy-fermion systems with tunable quantum fluctuations\nhave focused on a variety of zero-temperature phase transitions that involve\nnot only the onset of magnetic order but also the destruction of Kondo\nentanglement. Motivated by these developments, we investigate the effect of\nenhanced quantum fluctuations induced by a transverse magnetic field in an\nIsing-anisotropic Kondo lattice model, solved within an extended dynamical mean\nfield theory using the numerical renormalization group. A line of locally\ncritical points describes a direct transition from a Kondo-screened\nparamagnetic heavy-fermion state to a Kondo-destroyed antiferromagnetic phase.\nAlong the line, the extracted critical exponents remain unchanged. By probing\nthe the interplay between quantum fluctuations of the local moments, the Kondo\neffect, and magnetic order, this study provides significant new insight into\nthe global phase diagram of heavy-fermion systems.\n", "  To stabilize the periodic operation of a chemical reactor the oscillation\nperiod should be determined precisely in real time. The method discussed in the\npaper is based on adaptive sampling of the state variable with the use of\nchaotic mapping to itself. It enables precise determination of the oscillation\nperiod in real time and could be used for a proper control system, that can\nsuccessfully control the process and maintain the oscillation period at a set\nlevel. The method was applied to a tank reactor and tubular reactor with\nrecycle.\n", "  We study one-way quantum deficit of two-qubit $X$ states systematically from\nanalytical derivations. An effective approach to compute one-way quantum\ndeficit of two-qubit $X$ states has been provided. Analytical results are\npresented as for detailed examples. Moreover, we demonstrate the decoherence of\none-way quantum deficit under phase damping channel.\n", "  We study the Keldysh Green's function of the Weyl-fermion surface state of\nthe three-dimensional topological insulator coupled with a space-time dependent\nmagnetization in the gradient expansion. Based on it we analyze the electric\ncharge and current densities as well as the energy density and current induced\nby spatially and temporally slowly-varying magnetization fields. We show that\nall the above quantities except the energy current are generated by the\nemergent electromagnetic fields. The energy current emerges as the circular\ncurrent reflecting the spatial modulation of an induced gap of the Weyl\nfermion.\n", "  For many years the FORS2 instrument has suffered from artefacts in the flat\nfields caused by surface inhomogeneities on the longitudinal atmospheric\ndispersion corrector (LADC) that affected high-precision photometric and\nspectroscopic measurements. Recently, the FORS LADC prisms were exchanged, and\nour analysis of a large number of flat fields shows that this exchange has\nresulted in a significant decrease in the level of small-scale artefacts.\n", "  The star formation rates (SFRs) in weak emission line (WEL) galaxies in a\nvolume-limited ($0.02 < z < 0.05$) sample of blue early-type galaxies (ETGs)\nidentified from SDSS, are constrained here using 1.4 GHz radio continuum\nemission. The direct detection of 1.4 GHz radio continuum emission is made in 8\nWEL galaxies and a median stacking is performed on 57 WEL galaxies using VLA\nFIRST images. The median stacked 1.4 GHz flux density and luminosity are\nestimated as 79 $\\pm$ 19 $\\mu$Jy and 0.20 $\\pm$ 0.05 $\\times$ 10$^{21}$ W\nHz$^{-1}$ respectively. The radio far-infrared correlation in 4 WEL galaxies\nsuggests that the radio continuum emission from WEL galaxies is most likely due\nto star formation activities. The median SFR for WEL galaxies is estimated as\n0.23 $\\pm$ 0.06 M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, which is much less compared to SFRs ($0.5\n- 50$ M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) in purely star forming blue ETGs. The SFRs in blue\nETGs are found to be correlated with their stellar velocity dispersions\n($\\sigma$) and decreasing gradually beyond $\\sigma$ of $\\sim 100$ km s$^{-1}$.\nThis effect is most likely linked with the growth of black hole and suppression\nof star formation via AGN feedback. The color differences between SF and WEL\nsub-types of blue ETGs appear to be driven to large extent by the level of\ncurrent star formation activities. In a likely scenario of an evolutionary\nsequence between sub-types, the observed color distribution in blue ETGs can be\nexplained best in terms of fast evolution through AGN feedback.\n", "  SN 2012dn is a super-Chandrasekhar mass candidate in a purportedly normal\nspiral (SAcd) galaxy, and poses a challenge for theories of type Ia supernova\ndiversity. Here we utilize the fast and highly parameterized spectrum synthesis\ntool, SYNAPPS, to estimate relative expansion velocities of species inferred\nfrom optical spectra obtained with six facilities. As with previous studies of\nnormal SN Ia, we find that both unburned carbon and intermediate mass elements\nare spatially coincident within the ejecta near and below 14,000 km/s. Although\nthe upper limit on SN 2012dn's peak luminosity is comparable to some of the\nmost luminous normal SN Ia, we find a progenitor mass exceeding ~1.6 Msun is\nnot strongly favored by leading merger models since these models do not\naccurately predict spectroscopic observations of SN 2012dn and more normal\nevents. In addition, a comparison of light curves and host-galaxy masses for a\nsample of literature and Palomar Transient Factory SN Ia reveals a diverse\ndistribution of SN Ia subtypes where carbon-rich material remains unburned in\nsome instances. Such events include SN 1991T, 1997br, and 1999aa where trace\nsignatures of C III at optical wavelengths are presumably detected.\n", "  Flexible electronic devices require the integration of multiple crucial\ncomponents on soft substrates to achieve their functions. In particular, memory\ndevices are the fundamental component for data storage and processing in\nflexible electronics. Here, we present flexible MgO barrier magnetic tunnel\njunction (MTJ) devices fabricated using a transfer printing process, which\nexhibit reliable and stable operation under substantial deformation of the\ndevice substrates. In addition, the flexible MTJ devices yield significantly\nenhanced tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) of ~300 % and improved abruptness of\nswitching, as residual strain in the MTJ structure induced by the fabrication\nprocess is released during the transfer process. This approach could be useful\nfor a wide range of flexible electronic systems that require high performance\nmemory components.\n", "  We carried out optical polarimetry of an isolated cloud, Gal 110-13, to map\nthe plane-of-the-sky magnetic field geometry. The main aim of the study is to\nunderstand the most plausible mechanism responsible for the unusual cometary\nshape of the cloud in the context of its magnetic field geometry. When\nunpolarized starlight passes through the intervening interstellar dust grains\nthat are aligned with their short axes parallel to the local magnetic field, it\ngets linearly polarized. The plane-of-the-sky magnetic field component can\ntherefore be traced by doing polarization measurements of background stars\nprojected on clouds. Because the light in the optical wavelength range is most\nefficiently polarized by the dust grains typically found in the outer layers of\nthe molecular clouds, optical polarimetry enables us to trace the magnetic\nfield geometry of the outer layers of the clouds. We made R-band polarization\nmeasurements of 207 stars in the direction of Gal 110-13. The distance of Gal\n110-13 was determined as $\\sim450\\pm80$ pc using our polarization and 2MASS\nnear-infrared data. The foreground interstellar contribution was removed from\nthe observed polarization values by observing a number of stars located in the\nvicinity of Gal 110-13 which has Hipparcos parallax measurements. The\nplane-of-the-sky magnetic field lines are found to be well ordered and aligned\nwith the elongated structure of Gal 110-13. Using structure function analysis,\nwe estimated the strength of the plane-of-the-sky component of the magnetic\nfield as $\\sim25\\mu$G. Based on our results and comparing them with those from\nsimulations, we conclude that compression by the ionization fronts from 10 Lac\nis the most plausible cause of the comet-like morphology of Gal 110-13 and of\nthe initiation of subsequent star formation.\n", "  A flexoelectric peridynamic (PD) theory is proposed. Using the PD framework,\nthe formulation introduces, perhaps for the first time, a nanoscale\nflexoelectric coupling that entails non-uniform strain in centrosymmetric\ndielectrics. This potentially enables PD modeling of a large class of phenomena\nin solid dielectrics involving cracks, discontinuities etc. wherein large\nstrain gradients are present and the classical electromechanical theory based\non partial differential equations do not directly apply. Derived from\nHamilton's principle, PD electromechanical equations are shown to satisfy the\nglobal balance requirements. Linear PD constitutive equations reflect the\nelectromechanical coupling effect, with the mechanical force state affected by\nthe polarization state and the electrical force state in turn by the\ndisplacement state. An analytical solution of the PD electromechanical\nequations in the integral form is presented for the static case when a point\nmechanical force and a point electric force act in a three dimensional infinite\nsolid dielectric. A parametric study on how the different length scales\ninfluence the response is also undertaken.\n", "  For a grand canonical ensemble of classical point-like particles at\nequilibrium in continuous space we investigate the functional relationship\nbetween a stable and regular pair potential describing the interaction of the\nparticles and the corresponding molecular distribution functions. For certain\nadmissible perturbations of the pair potential and sufficiently small activity\nwe rigorously establish Frechet differentiability with respect to the supremum\nnorm in the image space -- both for bounded domains and in the thermodynamical\nlimit.\n", "  The parameters of the seasonal modulations (variations) in the intensity of\nmuons and cosmogenic neutrons generated by them at a mean muon energy of 280\nGeV have been determined in the LVD (Large Volume Detector) experiment. The\nmodulations of muons and neutrons are caused by a temperature effect, the\nseasonal temperature and density variations of the upper atmospheric layers.\nThe analysis performed here leads to the conclusion that the variations in the\nmean energy of the muon flux are the main source of underground cosmogenic\nneutron variations, because the energy of muons is more sensitive to the\ntemperature effect than their intensity. The parameters of the seasonal\nmodulations in the mean energy of muons and the flux of cosmogenic neutrons at\nthe LVD depth have been determined from the data obtained over seven years of\nLVD operation.\n", "  Binary systems with neutron stars and double degenerate systems are crucial\nobjects to test current stellar evolution models and Einstein's general\nrelativity. In this study, we present angular momentum loss mechanism via\ngravitational radiation and magnetized stellar winds for some selected systems\nwith a neutron star. We calculated and plotted their time scales for angular\nmomentum loss. Gravitational wave amplitudes of binary systems with a neutron\nstar components are also estimated and their detectability with a gravitational\nwave detector (LISA) has been plotted.\n", "  Discovery of gravitational waves by LIGO team (Abbott et al. 2016) bring a\nnew era for observation of black hole systems. These new observations will\nimprove our knowledge on black holes and gravitational physics. In this study,\nwe present angular momentum loss mechanism through gravitational radiation for\nselected X-ray binary systems. The angular momentum loss in X-ray binary\nsystems with a black hole companion due to gravitational radiation and mass\nloss time-scales are estimated for each selected system. In addition, their\ngravitational wave amplitudes are also estimated and their detectability with\ngravitational wave detectors has been discussed.\n", "  The effect of the frame dragging on the equation of motions, depends on the\napproaches that have been considered. Accordingly, additional force terms may\nappear or disappear. To understand the effect of radial and non-radial\nperturbations that may exist in the case of mass distribution of spherical\nshell form, modifications should be predicted to the approaches of the\ncomponents of elastic tensor $E^{\\mu\\nu}$ given in Bass and Pirani (1955).\nDifferent relations between $\\omega$ and $\\omega'$ have been discussed.\n", "  A new Laves phase superconductor NbBe2, prototype with MgCu2, having maximum\nTc ~2.6 K has been reported very recently. Based on first-principle\ncalculations, we systematically study the structural, elastic, mechanical,\nelectronic, thermal and superconducting properties of the newly reported\nsuperconducting intermetallic compound NbBe2. Finally, we investigate the\nelectron-phonon coupling constant, phonon dispersion curve and density of\nstates which indicates that the compound under study is a weakly coupled BCS\nsuperconductor.\n", "  Diamond provides superior optical and mechanical material properties, making\nit a prime candidate for the realization of integrated optomechanical circuits.\nBecause diamond sub- strates have matured in size, efficient nanostructuring\nmethods can be used to realize full-scale integrated devices. Here we review\noptical and mechanical resonators fab- ricated from polycrystalline as well as\nsingle crystalline diamond. We present relevant material properties with\nrespect to implementing optomechanical devices and compare them with other\nmaterial systems. We give an overview of diamond integrated optomechanical\ncircuits and present the optical readout mechanism and the actuation via\noptical or electrostatic forces that have been implemented to date. By\ncombining diamond nanophotonic circuits with superconducting nanowires single\nphotons can be efficiently detected on such chips and we outline how future\nsingle photon optomechanical circuits can be realized on this platform.\n", "  We report the successful formation of bulk insulating ternary topological\ninsulators candidate Bi2Se2Te (BST) by pulsed laser deposition technique. The\nfilms were deposited with sequential ablation of separate Bi2Se3 (BS) and\nBi2Te3 (BT) targets. From the X-ray diffraction analysis and temperature\ndependent resistivity we were able to conclude that the as grown thin films\nhave ordered chalcogen layers and the chemical potential in these thin films\nlie in the bulk gap. To realize entirely topological transport for any device\napplications it is essential to tune the chemical potential in the bulk gap of\nthe Dirac cone. Magnetotransport data exhibits pronounced two dimensional\nweak-antilocalization behavior (WAL) at low temperatures. BS and BT thin films\ndo not exhibit topological transport as the chemical potential does not lie\nentirely in the bulk gap. It was found that BST thin films grown with this cost\neffective and simple yet elegant technique using double target can be used to\ndeposit quaternary TI thin films, thereby tuning the chemical potential at will\nin the gap.\n", "  Quenched and unquenched quark models predict very different patterns for the\nspectrum of the low excited hyperon states. Evidence is accumulating for the\nexistence of some new hyperon resonances, such as a $\\Sigma^*$ of spin-parity\n$J^P=1/2^-$ around 1400 MeV instead of 1620 MeV as listed in PDG, a new\n$\\Sigma(1540)3/2^-$ resonance, a new narrow $\\Lambda(1670)3/2^-$ resonance and\na new $\\Lambda(1680)3/2^+$ resonance. All these new hyperon resonances fit in\nthe predicted pattern of the unquenched quark models very well. It is extremely\nimportant to check and establish the spectrum of these low excited hyperon\nstates by the proposed $K_L$ beam experiments at JLAB.\n", "  During many years since the birth of quantum mechanics, instrumentalist\ninterpretations prevailed: the meaning of the theory was expressed in terms of\nmeasurements results. But in the last decades, several attempts to interpret it\nfrom a realist viewpoint have been proposed. Among them, modal interpretations\nsupply a realist non-collapse account, according to which the system always has\ndefinite properties and the quantum state represents possibilities, not\nactualities. However, the traditional modal interpretations faced some\nconceptual problems when addressing imperfect measurements. The\nmodal-Hamiltonian interpretation, on the contrary, proved to be able to supply\nan adequate account of the measurement problem, both in its ideal and its\nnon-ideal versions. Moreover, in the non-ideal case, it gives a precise\ncriterion to distinguish between reliable and non-reliable measurements.\nNevertheless, that criterion depends on the particular state of the measured\nsystem, and this might be considered as a shortcoming of the proposal. In fact,\none could ask for a criterion of reliability that does not depend on the\nfeatures of what is measured but only on the properties of the measurement\ndevice. The aim of this article is precisely to supply such a criterion: we\nwill adopt an informational perspective for this purpose.\n", "  The von Neumann lattice refers to a discrete basis of Gaussians located on a\nlattice in phase space. It provides an attractive approach for solving quantum\nmechanical problems, allowing the pruning of tensor-product basis sets using\nphase space considerations. In a series of recent articles Shimshovitz et al.\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 109 7 (2012)], Takemoto et al. [Journal of Chemical Physics\n137 1 (2012)] Machnes et al. [Journal of Chemical Physics, accepted (2016)]),\nwe have introduced two key new elements into the method: a formalism for\nconverging the basis and for efficient pruning by use of the biorthogonal\nbasis. In this paper we review the key components of the theory and then\npresent new, efficient and parallelizable iterative algorithms for solving the\ntime-independent and time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equations. The algorithms\ndynamically determine the active reduced basis iteratively without resorting to\nclassical analogs. These algorithmic developments, combined with the previous\nformal developments, allow quantum dynamics to be performed directly and\neconomically in phase space. We provide two illustrative examples: double-well\ntunneling and double ionization of helium.\n", "  Recent advances in experimental and computational techniques have allowed for\nan accurate description of the adsorption of ionic liquids on metallic\nelectrodes. It is now well established that they adopt a multi-layered\nstructure, and that the composition of the layers changes with the potential of\nthe electrode. In some cases, potential-driven ordering transitions in the\nfirst adsorbed layer have been observed in experiments probing the interface on\nthe molecular scale or by molecular simulations. This perspective gives an\noverview of the current understanding of such transitions and of their\npotential impact on the physical and (electro)chemical processes at the\ninterface. In particular, peaks in the differential capacitance, slow dynamics\nat the interface and changes in the reactivity have been reported in\nelectrochemical studies. Interfaces between ionic liquids and metallic\nelectrodes are also highly relevant for their friction properties, the\nvoltage-dependence of which opens the way to exciting applications.\n", "  Many remarkably robust, rapid and spontaneous self-assembly phenomena in\nnature can be modeled geometrically starting from a collection of rigid bunches\nof spheres. This paper highlights the role of symmetry in sphere-based assembly\nprocesses. Since spheres within bunches could be identical and bunches could be\nidentical as well, the underlying symmetry groups could be of large order that\ngrows with the number of participating spheres and bunches. Thus, understanding\nsymmetries and associated isomorphism classes of microstates correspond to\nvarious types of macrostates can significantly reduce the complexity of\ncomputing entropy and free energy, as well as paths and kinetics, in high\ndimensional configuration spaces. In addition, a precise understanding of\nsymmetries is crucial for giving provable guarantees of algorithmic accuracy\nand efficiency in such computations. In particular, this may aid in predicting\ncrucial assembly-driving interactions.\n  This is a primarily expository paper that develops a novel, original\nframework for dealing with symmetries in configuration spaces of assembling\nspheres with the following goals. (1) We give new, formal definitions of\nvarious concepts relevant to sphere-based assembly that occur in previous work,\nand in turn, formal definitions of their relevant symmetry groups leading to\nthe main theorem concerning their symmetries. These previously developed\nconcepts include, for example, (a) assembly configuration spaces, (b)\nstratification of assembly configuration space into regions defined by active\nconstraint graphs, (c) paths through the configurational regions, and (d)\ncoarse assembly pathways. (2) We demonstrate the new symmetry concepts to\ncompute sizes and numbers of orbits in two example settings appearing in\nprevious work. (3) We give formal statements of a variety of open problems and\nchallenges using the new conceptual definitions.\n", "  Synapses are functional links between neurons, through which \"information\"\nflows in the neural network. These connections vary significantly in strength,\ntypically resulting from the intrinsic heterogeneity in their chemical and\nbiological properties. Such heterogeneity is fundamental to the diversity of\nneural activities, which together with other features of the brain enables\nfunctions ranging from perception and recognition, to memory and reasoning.\nRealizing such heterogeneity in synaptic electronics is critical towards\nbuilding artificial neural network with the potential for achieving the level\nof complexity in biological systems. However, such intrinsic heterogeneity has\nbeen very challenging to realize in current synaptic devices. Here, we\ndemonstrate the first black phosphorus (BP) synaptic device, which offers\nintrinsic anisotropy in its synaptic characteristics directly resulting from\nits low crystal symmetry. The charge transfer between the 2-nm native oxide of\nBP and the BP channel is utilized to achieve the synaptic behavior. Key\nfeatures of biological synapses such as long-term plasticity with\nheterogeneity, including long-term potentiation/depression and\nspike-timing-dependent plasticity, are mimicked. With the anisotropic BP\nsynaptic devices, we also realize a simple compact heterogeneous\naxon-multi-synapses network. This demonstration represents an important step\ntowards introducing intrinsic heterogeneity to artificial neuromorphic systems.\n", "  We give some arguments to evaluate the \"size\" of Schrodinger cat for the flux\nqubit, which has really different results from ref.[1] Korsbakken et al.\n  [1] J.Korsbakken,F.K.Wilhelm and K.B.Whaley,Physics Scripta T137,014022\n(2009)\n", "  It is well known that the nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger (NLS) equation is a very\nimportant integrable equation. Ablowitz and Musslimani introduced and\ninvestigated an integrable nonlocal NLS equation through inverse scattering\ntransform. Very recently, we proposed an integrable nonlocal modified\nKorteweg-de Vries equation (mKdV) which can also be found in a paper of\nAblowitz and Musslimani. We have constructed the Darboux transformation and\nsoliton solutions for the nonlocal mKdV equation. In this paper, we will\ninvestigate further the nonlocal mKdV equation. We will give its exact\nsolutions including soliton and breather through inverse scattering\ntransformation. These solutions have some new properties, which are different\nfrom the ones of the mKdV equation.\n", "  This paper is not (or at least not only) about human infant mortality. In\nline with reliability theory, \"infant\" will refer here to the time interval\nfollowing birth during which the mortality (or failure) rate decreases. This\ndefinition provides a systems science perspective in which birth constitutes a\nsudden transition which falls within the field of application of the \"Transient\nShock\" (TS) conjecture put forward in Richmond et al. (2016c). This conjecture\nprovides predictions about the timing and shape of the death rate peak. (i) It\nsays that there will be a death rate spike whenever external conditions change\nabruptly and drastically. (ii) It predicts that after a steep rising there will\nbe a much longer hyperbolic relaxation process. These predictions can be tested\nby considering living organisms for which birth is a multi-step process. Thus,\nfor fish there are three states: egg, yolk-sac phase, young adult. The TS\nconjecture predicts a mortality spike at the end of the yolk-sac phase, and\nthis timing is indeed confirmed by observation. Secondly, the hyperbolic nature\nof the relaxation process can be tested using high accuracy Swiss statistics\nwhich give postnatal death rates from one hour after birth up to the age of 10\nyears. It turns out that since the 19th century despite a great overall\nreduction in infant mortality, the shape of the age-specific death rate has\nremained basically unchanged. This hyperbolic pattern is not specific to\nhumans. It can also be found in small primates as recorded in the archives of\nzoological gardens. Our ultimate objective is to set up a chain of cases which\nstarts from simple systems and then moves up step by step to more complex\norganisms. The cases discussed here can be seen as initial landmarks.\n", "  To investigate the high mass dilepton production cross section produced due\nto the Drell-Yan process in hadronic collisions such as nucleon- nucleus, the\nvalence and sea quarks distribution functions inside nucleus is used. In this\nstudy, in the framework of the shell and Fermi gas models, by adding quarks\ndistribution functions of pions inside nucleus besides the quarks distribution\nfunctions of bound nucleons, the changes in the dilepton production cross\nsection were investigated. For this reason, pionic contribution in the\nstructure function of 63Cunucleus and its EMC ratio was first studied using the\naforementioned models. Then, in the framework of the Drell-Yan process using\nGRV's nucleons and pions quarks distribution functions, the high mass dilepton\nproduction cross section in p-cu collision was calculated and compared with the\navailable experimental data. The extracted results, based on the two mentioned\nmodels, were greatly the same and by considering the pionic contribution, the\ntheoretical results were consistent with the experimental data.\n", "  The Death and Life of Great American Cities was written in 1961 and is now\none of the most influential book in city planning. In it, Jane Jacobs proposed\nfour conditions that promote life in a city. However, these conditions have not\nbeen empirically tested until recently. This is mainly because it is hard to\ncollect data about \"city life\". The city of Seoul recently collected pedestrian\nactivity through surveys at an unprecedented scale, with an effort spanning\nmore than a decade, allowing researchers to conduct the first study\nsuccessfully testing Jacobs's conditions. In this paper, we identify a valuable\nalternative to the lengthy and costly collection of activity survey data:\nmobile phone data. We extract human activity from such data, collect land use\nand socio-demographic information from the Italian Census and Open Street Map,\nand test the four conditions in six Italian cities. Although these cities are\nvery different from the places for which Jacobs's conditions were spelled out\n(i.e., great American cities) and from the places in which they were recently\ntested (i.e., the Asian city of Seoul), we find those conditions to be indeed\nassociated with urban life in Italy as well. Our methodology promises to have a\ngreat impact on urban studies, not least because, if replicated, it will make\nit possible to test Jacobs's theories at scale.\n", "  The state of vanishing friction known as superlubricity has important\napplications for energy saving and increasing the lifetime of devices.\nSuperlubricity detected with atomic force microscopy appears in examples like\nsliding large graphite flakes or gold nanoclusters across surfaces. However,\nthe origin of the behavior is poorly understood due to the lack of a\ncontrollable nano-contact. We demonstrate graphene nanoribbons superlubricity\nwhen sliding on gold with a joint experimental and computational approach. The\natomically well-defined contact allows us to trace the origin of\nsuperlubricity, unravelling the role played by edges, surface reconstruction\nand ribbon elasticity. Our results pave the way to the scale-up of\nsuperlubricity toward the realization of frictionless coatings.\n", "  The energy-spread of the triple-pulse electron beam generated by the\nDragon-II linear induction accelerator is measured using the method of energy\ndispersion in the magnetic field. A sector magnet is applied for energy\nanalyzing of the electron beam, which has a bending radius of 300 mm and a\ndeflection angle of 90 degrees. For each pulse, both the time-resolved and the\nintegral images of the electron position at the output port of the bending beam\nline are recorded by a streak camera and a CCD camera, respectively.\nExperimental results demonstrate an energy-spread of less than +-2.0% for the\nelectron pulses. The cavity voltage waveforms obtained by different detectors\nare also analyzed for comparison.\n", "  Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques enable imaging\nbiological samples well beyond the diffraction limit of light, but they vary\nsignificantly in their spatial and temporal resolutions. High-order statistical\nanalysis of temporal fluctuations as in superresolution optical fluctuation\nimaging (SOFI) also enable imaging beyond diffraction limit, but usually at a\nlower resolution as compared to SMLM. Since the same data format is acquired\nfor both methods, their algorithms can be applied to the same data set, and\nthus may be combined synergistically to improve overall imaging performance.\nHere, we find that SOFI converges much faster than SMLM, provides additive\ninformation to SMLM, and can efficiently reject background. We then show how\nSOFI-assisted SMLM imaging can improve SMLM image reconstruction by rejecting\ncommon sources of background, especially under low signal-to-background\nconditions. The performance of our approach was evaluated using a realistic\nsimulation of fluorescence imaging we developed and further demonstrated on\nexperimental SMLM images of the plasma membrane of activated fixed and live T\ncells. Our approach significantly enhances SMLM performance under demanding\nimaging conditions and could set an example for synergizing additional imaging\ntechniques.\n", "  By using the HOMFLY skein theory. We prove a strong integrality theorem for\nthe reduced colored HOMFLYPT invariants defined by a basis in the full HOMFLY\nskein of the annulus.\n", "  Extensive all-atom molecular dynamics calculations on the water-squalane\ninterface for nine different loadings with sorbitan monooleate (SPAN80), at\n$T=300$K, are analyzed for the surface tension equation of state, desorption\nfree energy profiles as they depend on loading, and to evaluate escape times\nfor absorbed SPAN80 into the bulk phases. These results suggest that loading\nonly weakly affects accommodation of a SPAN80 molecule by this squalane-water\ninterface. Specifically, the surface tension equation of state is simple\nthrough the range of high tension to high loading studied, and the desorption\nfree energy profiles are weakly dependent on loading here. The perpendicular\nmotion of the centroid of the SPAN80 head-group ring is well-described by a\ndiffusional model near the minimum of the desorption free energy profile.\nLateral diffusional motion is weakly dependent on loading. Escape times\nevaluated on the basis of a diffusional model and the desorption free energies\nare $7\\times 10^{-2}$ s (into the squalane) and $3\\times 10^2$ h (into the\nwater). The latter value is consistent with irreversible absorption observed by\nrelated experimental work.\n", "  In this thesis, we study the breakdown of the Fermi liquid state in cuprate\nsuperconductors using the renormalization group (RG). We seek to extend earlier\nwork on the crossover from the Fermi liquid state to the pseudo gap phase based\non RG flows in the so-called saddle point regime. Progress in the derivation of\neffective models for the conjectured spin liquid state has been hindered, by\nthe difficulties involved in solving the strong coupling low energy\nHamiltonian. We tackle the problem by introducing an orthogonal wave packet\nbasis, the so-called Wilson-Wannier (WW) basis, that can be used to interpolate\nbetween the momentum space and the real space descriptions.\n  We show how to combine the WW basis with the RG, such that the RG is used to\neliminate high-energy degrees of freedom, and the remaining strongly correlated\nsystem is solved approximately in the WW basis. We exemplify the approach for\ndifferent one-dimensional model systems, and find good qualitative agreement\nwith exact solutions even for very simple approximations.\n  Finally, we reinvestigate the saddle point regime of the two-dimensional\nHubbard model. We show that the anti-nodal states are driven to an insulating\nspin-liquid state with strong singlet pairing correlations, thus corroborating\nearlier conjectures.\n", "  Negative magnetoresistance (NMR) induced by the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly is\nregarded as the most prominent quantum signature of Weyl semimetals when\nelectrical field $E$ is collinear with the external magnetic field $B$. In this\narticle, we report universal NMR in nonmagnetic, centrosymmetric transition\nmetal dipnictides MPn$_{2}$ (M=Nb and Ta; Pn=As and Sb), in which the existence\nof Weyl fermions can be explicitly excluded. Using temperature-dependent\nmagnetoresistance, Hall and thermoelectric coefficients of Nernst and Seebeck\neffects, we determine that the emergence of the NMR phenomena in MPn$_{2}$ is\ncoincident with a Lifshitz transition, corresponding to the formation of unique\nelectron-hole-electron ($e$-$h$-$e$) pockets along the $I-L-I'$ direction.\nFirst-principles calculations reveal that, along the $I-L-I'$ line, the\n$d_{xy}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbitals of the transition metal form tilted\nnodal rings of band crossing well below the Fermi level. Strong spin-orbital\ncoupling gaps all the crossing points and creates the characteristic\n$e$-$h$-$e$ structure, making MPn$_{2}$ a topological semimetal with\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ indices of [0;(111)]. By excluding the weak localization\ncontribution of the bulk states, we conclude that the universal NMR in\nMPn$_{2}$ may have an exotic origin in topological surface states, which\nappears in pairs with opposite spin-momentum locking on nontrivial surfaces.\n", "  Here we present results of our search for Giant Pulses(GPs) from pulsars of\nNorthern Hemisphere. Our survey was carried out at a frequency of 111 MHz using\nthe Large Phased Array (LPA) radio telescope. Up to now we have detected\nregular generation of strong pulses satisfying the criteria of GPs from 2\npulsars: B1133+16, B1237+25.\n", "  Black phosphorus (BP) has recently emerged as a promising narrow band gap\nlayered semiconductor with optoelectronic properties that bridge the gap\nbetween semi-metallic graphene and wide band gap transition metal\ndichalcogenides such as MoS2. To date, BP field-effect transistors have\nutilized a lateral geometry with in-plane transport dominating device\ncharacteristics. In contrast, we present here a vertical field-effect\ntransistor geometry based on a graphene/BP van der Waals heterostructure. The\nresulting device characteristics include high on-state current densities (>\n1600 A/cm2) and current on/off ratios exceeding 800 at low temperature. Two\ndistinct charge transport mechanisms are identified, which are dominant for\ndifferent regimes of temperature and gate voltage. In particular, the Schottky\nbarrier between graphene and BP determines charge transport at high\ntemperatures and positive gate voltages, whereas tunneling dominates at low\ntemperatures and negative gate voltages. These results elucidate out-of-plane\nelectronic transport in BP, and thus have implications for the design and\noperation of BP-based van der Waals heterostructures.\n", "  Extending the results of Borichev--Golinskii--Kupin [2009], we obtain refined\nBlaschke-type necessary conditions on the zero distribution of analytic\nfunctions on the unit disk and on the complex plane with a cut along the\npositive semi-axis satisfying some non-radial growth restrictions.\n", "  We develop an iterative diagonalization scheme in solving a one-body\nself-consistent-field equation in the transcorrelated (TC) method using a\nplane-wave basis set. Non-Hermiticity in the TC method is well handled with a\nblock-Davidson algorithm. We verify the required computational cost is\nefficiently reduced by our algorithm. In addition, we apply our\nplane-wave-basis TC calculation to some simple $sp$-electron systems with deep\ncore states to elucidate an impact of the pseudopotential approximation to the\ncalculated band structures. We find a position of the deep valence bands is\nimproved by an explicit inclusion of core states, but an overall band structure\nis consistent with a regular setup that includes core states into the\npseudopotentials. This study offers an important understanding for the future\napplication of the TC method to strongly correlated solids.\n", "  This document summarises the proposal of the LHC Dark Matter Working Group on\nhow to present LHC results on $s$-channel simplified dark matter models and to\ncompare them to direct (indirect) detection experiments.\n", "  Electrides are ionic solids that consist of cationic frameworks and anionic\nelectrons trapped in the voids of lattices. Organic electrides exist in a large\nabundance, but the thermal instability at room temperature and sensitivity to\nmoisture are bottlenecks that limit their practical uses. Known inorganic\nelectrides are rare but appear to have high thermal and chemical stability and\nexhibit promising applications as electron-emitting materials, superior\ncatalysts and strong reducing agents. Here, we report a developed\ninverse-design method that can be used to search for a large variety of\ninorganic electrides. Our method utilizes the intrinsic property of\ninterstitial electron localization of electrides as the global variable\nfunction being incorporated into the swarm-intelligence based structure\nsearches. Through screening 99 binary ionic compounds, we have designed 89 new\ninorganic electrides that are classified into three-, two-, and\nzero-dimensional species according to the way that the interstitial electrons\nare localized and the conductive properties of the systems. Our work reveals\nthe rich abundance of inorganic electrides by extending them into more general\nforms and provides new structure types for electrides that are not thought of\nas before.\n", "  We investigate the effect of a small, gauge-invariant mass of the gluon on\nthe anomalous chromomagnetic moment of quarks (ACM) by perturbative\ncalculations at one loop level. The mass of the gluon is taken to have been\ngenerated via a topological mass generation mechanism, in which the gluon\nacquires a mass through its interaction with an antisymmetric tensor field\n$B_{\\mu \\nu}$. For a small gluon mass $(<10$ MeV), we calculate the ACM at\nmomentum transfer $q^2=-M_Z^2$. We compare those with the ACM calculated for\nthe gluon mass arising from a Proca mass term. We find that the ACM of up,\ndown, strange and charm quarks vary significantly with the gluon mass, while\nthe ACM of top and bottom quarks show negligible gluon mass dependence. The\nmechanism of gluon mass generation is most important for the strange quarks\nACM, but not so much for the other quarks. We also show the results at\n$q^2=-m_t^2$. We find that the dependence on gluon mass at $q^2=-m_t^2$ is much\nless than at $q^2=-M_Z^2$ for all quarks.\n", "  An efficient numerical method for computing angle-resolved light scattering\noff periodic arrays is presented. The method combines finite-element\ndiscretization with a Schur complement solver. A significant speed-up of the\ncomputations in comparison to standard finite-element method computations is\nobserved.\n", "  We have observed a metal-insulator transition of a quasi-two dimensional\nelectronic system in transition metal dichalcogenide $2H$-TaSe$_2$ caused by\ndoping iron. The sheet resistance of $2H$-Fe$_x$TaSe$_2$ ($0 \\leq x \\leq\n0.120$) single crystals rises about $10^6$ times with the increasing of $x$ at\nthe lowest temperature. We investigated the temperature dependence of the\nresistance and found a metal-insulator transition with a critical sheet\nresistance $11.7 \\pm 5.4$ k$\\rm{\\Omega}$. The critical exponent of the\nlocalization length $\\nu$ is estimated $0.31 \\pm 0.18$. The values of the\ncritical sheet resistance and $\\nu$ are accordant to those of the\n\\textit{chiral unitary class} (less than $h/1.49e^2=17.3$ k$\\rm{\\Omega}$ and\n$0.35 \\pm 0.03$, respectively). We suggest that $2H$-Fe$_x$TaSe$_2$ is\nclassified as the chiral unitary class, not as standard unitary class.\n", "  Recently, a new kind of two dimensional (2D) artificial electron lattice,\ni.e. molecule graphene, has drawn a lots of interest, where the metal surface\nelectrons are transformed into a honeycomb lattice via absorbing a molecule\nlattice on metal surface. In this work, we would like to point out that the\ntechnique used to build molecule graphene actually gives a promising way to\nexplore the interesting physics of other novel 2D lattice beyond graphene. The\nkey issue is that this system is an antidot system, where the absorbed molecule\nnormally gives a repulsive potential. So, we need to establish a map between\nthe molecule arrangement and the desired surface electron lattice. To give a\nconcrete example, we first analyse the effective models of molecule graphene,\nand estimate the model parameters for the Cu/CO system through numerical\nfitting the exerimental data. Then, we design a molecule lattice, and show\nthat, with this kind of lattice, the surface electrons can be transformed into\na Kagome like lattice. Using the estimated parameters of Cu/CO system, we\ncalculate the corresponding energy bands and LDOS, which can be readily tested\nin experiment. We hope that our work can stimulate further theoretical and\nexperimental interest in this novel artificial 2D electron lattice.\n", "  We study the corrections to the scalar boson mass in an abelian Higgs model\nby considering the global properties of the partition function. We find that\nalthough the two point function for the Higgs boson receives quantum\ncorrections, the mass of the scalar remains unaltered and thus the physical\nmass is equal to the bare one.\n", "  We propose that the TeV scale mirage mediation in the Next-to-Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) is a novel solution for the little\nhierarchy problem in supersymmetry. The 125 GeV Higgs boson can be accommodated\nwith the new quartic coupling or the mixing with the singlet. The fine-tuning\nmeasures are estimated numerically and found as low as 10\\% or below for $1.5$\nTeV gluino and $1$ TeV stop. The higgsino can be as heavy as 500 GeV without\ndeteriorating the fine-tuning. An undesirable singlet-doublet mixing in the\nHiggs sector is suppressed due to approximate scale symmetries. We investigate\nthe couplings of the Higgs bosons and discuss the prospects for studying them\nat LHC and ILC.\n", "  Using finite difference method, time evolution of a typical metal molecule\nmetal system is studied by introducing a new method to solve general related\nVolterra integro differential equation (IDE). Discretization in time domain is\napplied for one dimentional chain tight binding model in several cases by\ndefining a matrix integro-differential equation (MIDE). Results are compatible\nwith their analytical counterparts and show more accuracy than other numerical\nmethods like Runge Kutta (RK). Charge transport properties in a trans\npolyacetylene chain are found by studying the time evolution of charge density\nin it and current voltage diagram is calculated.\n", "  Equatorial superrotation under zonally-symmetric thermal forcing is\ninvestigated in a setup close to that of the classic Held & Suarez (1994)\nsetup. In contrast to the behaviour in the classic setup, a transition to\nequatorial superrotation occurs when the equator-to-pole surface equilibrium\nentropy gradient is weakened. Two factors contribute to this transition: 1) the\nreduction of breaking Rossby waves from the mid-latitude that decelerate the\nequatorial flow and 2) the presence of barotropic instability in the equatorial\nregion, providing stirring to accelerate the equatorial flow. In the latter,\nKelvin waves excited by instability near the equator generate and maintain the\nsuperrotation. However, the superrotation is unphysically enhanced if\nsimulations are under-resolved and/or over-dissipated.\n", "  Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a link-tracing sampling method that is\nespecially suitable for sampling hidden populations. RDS combines an efficient\nsnowball-type sampling scheme with inferential procedures that yield unbiased\npopulation estimates under some assumptions about the sampling procedure and\npopulation structure. Several seed individuals are typically used to initiate\nRDS recruitment. However, standard RDS estimation theory assume that all\nsampled individuals originate from only one seed. We present an estimator,\nbased on a random walk with teleportation, which accounts for the multiple seed\nstructure of RDS. The new estimator can also be used on populations with\ndisconnected social networks. We numerically evaluate our estimator by\nsimulations on artificial and real networks. Our estimator outperforms previous\nestimators, especially when the proportion of seeds in the sample is large. We\nrecommend our new estimator to be used in RDS studies, in particular when the\nnumber of seeds is large or the social network of the population is\ndisconnected.\n", "  We report here the development of hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular\nmechanics (QM/MM) interface between the plane-wave density functional theory\nbased CPMD code and the empirical force-field based GULP code for modeling\nperiodic solids and surfaces. The hybrid QM/MM interface is based on the\nelectrostatic coupling between QM and MM regions. The interface is designed for\ncarrying out full relaxation of all the QM and MM atoms during geometry\noptimizations and molecular dynamics simulations, including the boundary atoms.\nBoth Born-Oppenheimer and Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics schemes are enabled\nfor the QM part during the QM/MM calculations. This interface has the advantage\nof parallelization of both the programs such that the QM and MM force\nevaluations can be carried out in parallel in order to model large systems. The\ninterface program is first validated for total energy conservation and parallel\nscaling performance is benchmarked. Oxygen vacancy in {\\alpha}-cristobalite is\nthen studied in detail and the results are compared with a fully QM calculation\nand experimental data. Subsequently, we use our implementation to investigate\nthe structure of rhodium cluster (Rh$_n$ ; $n$=2 to 6) formed from\nRh(C$_2$H$_4$)$_2$ complex adsorbed within a cavity of Y-zeolite in a reducible\natmosphere of H$_2$ gas.\n", "  In this paper, we study the network of global interconnections between\nlanguage communities, based on shared co-editing interests of Wikipedia\neditors, and show that although English is discussed as a potential lingua\nfranca of the digital space, its domination disappears in the network of\nco-editing similarities, and instead local connections come to the forefront.\nOut of the hypotheses we explored, bilingualism, linguistic similarity of\nlanguages, and shared religion provide the best explanations for the similarity\nof interests between cultural communities. Population attraction and\ngeographical proximity are also significant, but much weaker factors bringing\ncommunities together. In addition, we present an approach that allows for\nextracting significant cultural borders from editing activity of Wikipedia\nusers, and comparing a set of hypotheses about the social mechanisms generating\nthese borders. Our study sheds light on how culture is reflected in the\ncollective process of archiving knowledge on Wikipedia, and demonstrates that\ncross-lingual interconnections on Wikipedia are not dominated by one powerful\nlanguage. Our findings also raise some important policy questions for the\nWikimedia Foundation.\n", "  The compound Bi14Rh3I9 consists of ionic stacks of intermetallic\n[(Bi4Rh)3I]2+ and insulating [Bi2I8]2- layers and has been identified to be a\nweak topological insulator. Scanning tunneling microscopy revealed the robust\nedge states at all step edges of the cationic layer as a topological\nfingerprint. However, these edge states are found 0.25 eV below the Fermi level\nwhich is an obstacle for transport experiments. Here, we address this obstacle\nby comparing results of density functional slab calculations with scanning\ntunneling spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We show\nthat the n-type doping of the intermetallic layer is intrinsically caused by\nthe polar surface and is well screened towards the bulk. In contrast, the\nanionic \"spacer\" layer shows a gap at the Fermi level, both, on the surface and\nin the bulk, i.e. it is not surface-doped due to iodine desorption. The well\nscreened surface dipole implies that a buried edge state, probably already\nbelow a single spacer layer, is located at the Fermi level. Consequently, a\nmultilayer step covered by a spacer layer could provide access to the transport\nproperties of the topological edge states. In addition, we find a lateral\nelectronic modulation of the topologically non-trivial surface layer which is\ntraced back to the coupling with the underlying zigzag chain structure of the\nspacer layer.\n", "  Urban mobility systems are composed multiple elements with strong\ninteractions, i.e. their future is co-determined by the state of other\nelements. Thus, studying components in isolation, i.e. using a reductionist\napproach, is inappropriate. I propose five recommendations to improve urban\nmobility based on insights from the scientific study of complex systems: use\nadaptation over prediction, regulate interactions to avoid friction, use\nsensors to recover real time information, develop adaptive algorithms to\nexploit that information, and deploy agents to act on the urban environment.\n", "  We present large scale and detailed analysis of the microscopic empirical\ndata of the traffic flow, focusing on the non-linear interactions between the\nvehicles when the traffic is congested. By implementing a \"renormalisation\"\nprocedure that averages over relatively unimportant factors, we extract the\neffective dependence of the acceleration on the vehicle headway, velocity and\nrelative velocity, that characterises not just a few vehicles but the traffic\nsystem as a whole. Several interesting features of the detailed\nvehicle-to-vehicle interactions are revealed, including the stochastic\ndistribution of human responses, relative importance of non-linear terms in\ndifferent density regimes, symmetric response to the relative velocity, and the\ninsensitivity of the acceleration to the velocity within a certain headway and\nvelocity range. The latter leads to a multitude of steady-states without a\nfundamental diagram, showing strong evidence of the \"synchronised phase\",\nsubstantiated with additional microscopic details. We discuss the richness of\nthe available data for the understanding of the human driving behaviours, and\nits usefulness in construction and calibration of both deterministic and\nstochastic microscopic traffic models.\n", "  In this thesis I examine several different concepts of black hole entropy in\norder to understand whether they describe the same quantity. I look at\nstatistical and entanglement entropies, Wald entropy and Carlip's entropy from\nconformal field theory, and compare their behavior in a few specific aspects:\ndivergence at the BH horizon, dependence on space time curvature and behavior\nunder a geometric variation. I find that statistical and entanglement entropy\nmay be similar but they seem to differ from the entropy of Wald and Carlip.\nChapters 2 and 3 overlap with 1010.4157 and 1310.3938. Chapter 4 does not\nappear elsewhere.\n", "  The law introduced by Karlsson in spectroscopy of low-redshift quasars\ninvolves the Lyman spectrum of hydrogen atoms. Thus, it appears necessary to\nstudy the concepts introduced by a standard spectroscopy of quasars, studied\nhere, with those deducted from $\\Lambda$-CDM.A visible absorption of a sharp\nand saturated spectral line in a gas requires a long path without perturbations\nas collisions or cosmological redshift. Spectra of absorbed, saturated lines of\nquasars obeying Karlsson's law mainly result from interactions of natural,\nthermal light radiated by quasar with relatively cold, low presure atomic\nhydrogen. These lines are produced by three processes: a) A conventional\nabsorption in a relatively cold gas produces a set of lines; b) These lines are\nmultiplied by absorption after fundamental 3K or 4K redshifts, where K is\nKarlsson's constant: Spectra show that redshifts 3K (or 4K) exactly bring\nabsorbed Lyman beta (or gamma) line on Lyman alpha: redshift almost disappears,\nand gas lines are intensely absorbed in the absence of alpha absorption; c)\nRedshifts occur in regions where light at alpha frequency is poorly absorbed\ndue to permanent redshift, except when excitation of hydrogen to 2P level is\nsufficient for a superradiant flash emission at alpha frequency. This causes an\nintense absorption of high radiance rays from quasar, so the absorption of a\nline at current Lyman alpha frequency. Lightning and pumping produce relaxation\noscillations that write many absorption lines. Redshifts by H atoms in 2P\nlevels are due to parametric interactions composed of Impulsive Stimulated\nRaman Scatterings (ISRS): excited hydrogen atoms catalyze energy exchanges\nbetween observed ray and background cold thermal radiation, in agreement with\nthermodynamics. Description of Universe becomes much simpler, but less\nmarvelous.\n", "  Autocatalytic reaction fronts between two reacting species in the absence of\nfluid flow, propagate as solitary waves. The coupling between autocatalytic\nreaction front and forced hydrodynamic flow may lead to stationary front whose\nvelocity and shape depend on the underlying flow field. We focus on the issue\nof the chemo-hydrodynamic coupling between forced advection opposed to\nself-sustained chemical waves which can lead to static stationary fronts, i.e\nFrozen Fronts, $FF$. Towards that purpose, we perform experiments, analytical\ncomputations and numerical simulations with the autocatalytic Iodate Arsenious\nAcid reaction ($IAA$) over a wide range of flow velocities around a solid disk.\nFor the same set of control parameters, we observe two types of frozen fronts:\nan upstream $FF$ which avoid the solid disk and a downstream $FF$ with two\nsymmetric branches emerging from the solid disk surface. We delineate the range\nover which we do observe these Frozen Fronts. We also address the relevance of\nthe so-called eikonal, thin front limit to describe the observed fronts and\nselect the frozen front shapes.\n", "  The exact frame-dragging (or Lense-Thirring (LT) precession) rates for Kerr,\nKerr-Taub-NUT (KTN) and Taub-NUT spacetimes have been derived. Remarkably, in\nthe case of the `zero angular momentum' Taub-NUT spacetime, the frame-dragging\neffect is shown not to vanish, when considered for spinning test gyroscope. In\nthe case of the interior of the pulsars, the exact frame-dragging rate\nmonotonically decreases from the center to the surface along the pole and but\nit shows an `anomaly' along the equator. Moving from the equator to the pole,\nit is observed that this `anomaly' disappears after crossing a critical angle.\nThe `same' anomaly can also be found in the KTN spacetime. The resemblance of\nthe anomalous LT precessions in the KTN spacetimes and the spacetime of the\npulsars could be used to identify a role of Taub-NUT solutions in the\nastrophysical observations or equivalently, a signature of the existence of NUT\ncharge in the pulsars.\n", "  We theoretically study a vibrating pair of parallel electrodes bridged by a\n(deformed) liquid droplet, which is a recently developed microfluidic device to\nharvest vibrational energy. The device can operate with various liquids,\nincluding liquid metals, electrolytes, as well as ionic liquids. We numerically\nsolve the Young-Laplace equation for all droplet shapes during a vibration\nperiod, from which the time-dependent capacitance follows that serves as input\nfor an equivalent circuit model. We first investigate two existing energy\nharvesters (with a constant and a vanishing bias potential), for which we\nexplain an open issue related to their optimal electrode separations, which is\nas small as possible or as large as possible in the two cases, respectively.\nThen we propose a new engine with a time-dependent bias voltage, with which the\nharvested work and the power can be increased by orders of magnitude at low\nvibration frequencies and by factors 2-5 at high frequencies, where frequencies\nare to be compared to the inverse RC-time of the circuit.\n", "  Prior studies have shown that low symmetry particles such as micro-boomerangs\nexhibit behaviour of Brownian motion rather different from that of high\nsymmetry particles because convenient tracking points (TPs) are usually\ninconsistent with the center of hydrodynamic stress (CoH) where the\ntranslational and rotational motions are decoupled. In this paper we study the\neffects of the translation-rotation coupling on the displacement probability\ndistribution functions (PDFs) of the boomerang colloid particles with symmetric\narms. By tracking the motions of different points on the particle symmetry\naxis, we show that as the distance between the TP and the CoH is increased, the\neffects of translation-rotation coupling becomes pronounced, making the\nshort-time 2D PDF for fixed initial orientation to change from elliptical to\ncrescent shape and the angle averaged PDFs from ellipsoidal-particle-like PDF\nto a shape with a Gaussian top and long displacement tails. We also observed\nthat at long times the PDFs revert to Gaussian. This crescent shape of 2D PDF\nprovides a clear physical picture of the non-zero mean displacements observed\nin boomerangs particles.\n", "  A single water molecule has nothing special. However, macroscopic water\ndisplays many anomalous properties at the interface, such as a high surface\ntension, hydrophobicity and hydrophillicity. Although the underlying mechanism\nis still elusive, hydrogen bond is expected to have played an important role.\nAn interesting question is if the few-water molecule clusters will be\nqualitatively different from a single molecule. Using adsorption behavior as an\nexample, by carefully choosing two-dimensional silicene as the substrate\nmaterial, we demonstrate that water monomer, dimer and trimer show contrasting\nproperties. The additional water molecules in dimer and trimer induce a\ntransition from physisorption to chemisorption then to dissociation on\nsilicene. Such a hydrogen bond autocatalytic effect is expected to have a broad\napplication potential in silicene-based water molecule sensor and metal-free\ncatalyst for water dissociation.\n", "  Recent experiments [L. Ju et al., Nature, 2015, 520, 650] confirm the\nexistence of gapless states at domain walls created in gated bilayer graphene,\nwhen the sublattice stacking is changed from AB to BA. These states are\nsignificant because they are topologically protected, valley-polarized and give\nrise to conductance along the domain wall. Current theoretical models predict\nthe appearance of such states only at domain walls, which preserve the\nsublattice order. Here we show that the appearance of the topologically\nprotected states in stacking domain walls can be much more common in bilayer\ngraphene, since they can also emerge in unexpected geometries, e.g., at grain\nboundaries with atomic-scale topological defects. We focus on a bilayer system\nin which one of the layers contains a line of octagon-double pentagon defects,\nthat mix graphene sublattices. We demonstrate that gap states are preserved\neven with pentagonal defects. Remarkably, unlike previous predictions, the\nnumber of gap states changes by inverting the gate polarization, yielding an\nasymmetric conductance along the grain boundary under gate reversal. This\neffect, linked to defect states, should be detectable in transport measurements\nand could be exploited in electrical switches.\n", "  There is ample evidence that polymer brushes reduce friction between\nsurfaces. Several industrial applications take advantage of this fact, such as\nthose in plastic bag production, where the brushes act as slip agents; however,\nthe complex mechanisms that give rise to such reduction of friction are not yet\nfully understood. In this work we report coarse grained, dissipative particle\ndynamics simulations carried out for surfaces functionalized with erukamide\nbrushes, a polymer commonly used in the plastics industry as a slip agent\nbetween surfaces. We calculate their rheological properties, such as the\ncoefficient of friction (COF) and the viscosity, {\\eta}, as functions of the\nnumber of chains grafted on the surfaces under the influence of stationary,\nCouette flow. Moreover, we consider also the case when a fraction of the\nerukamide chains is not adsorbed and moves freely between the surfaces. We show\nthat the COF reaches an equilibrium value of about 0.29 in these two cases, in\nagreement with experimental results. On other hand, the viscosity grows\nmonotonically, as a result of the increasing collisions when the erukamide\ncontent is increased. The force between brushes is found to be in agreement\nwith predictions from scaling theories. We find that the addition to free\nchains helps stabilize the film formed by the brushes and the solvent, as\nothers have found experimentally. The mechanisms that give rise to these\nphenomena are studied in detail.\n", "  J.~Lepowsky and R.~L.~Wilson initiated the approach to combinatorial\nRogers-Ramanujan type identities via vertex operator constructions of standard\n(i.e. integrable highest weight) representations of affine Kac-Moody Lie\nalgebras. A.~Meurman and M.~Primc developed further this approach for\n$\\mathfrak{sl}(2,\\mathbb C)\\widetilde{}\\ $ by using vertex operator algebras\nand Verma modules. In this paper we use the same method to construct\ncombinatorial bases of basic modules for affine Lie algebras of type\n$C_{n}\\sp{(1)}$ and, as a consequence, we obtain a series of Rogers-Ramanujan\ntype identities. A major new insight is a combinatorial parametrization of\nleading terms of defining relations for level one standard modules for affine\nLie algebra of type $C_{n}\\sp{(1)}$.\n", "  Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, with their extreme properties, defy our\ncurrent knowledge of active galactic nuclei and relativistic jet systems. They\nexcite, and might help us answer, many questions concerning the evolution and\nunification of AGN, but still remain a poorly studied class of AGN as such.\n  We did an extensive study of a large sample of NLS1s using various\nstatistical methods, for example, multiwavelength correlations and principal\ncomponent analysis. We wanted to examine how and where in NLS1s different kinds\nof radiation are produced, and how the emission properties are connected to\nother intrinsic AGN properties. In addition we present the early results of our\nongoing research about the large-scale environments of NLS1s. We also introduce\nthe Mets\\\"ahovi Radio Observatory NLS1 survey and its first results, and show\nsome early results for individual sources.\n", "  Titan, with its thick, nitrogen-dominated atmosphere, has been seen from\nsatellite and terrestrial observations to harbour methane clouds. To\ninvestigate whether atmospheric features such as clouds could also be visible\nfrom the surface of Titan, data taken with the Side Looking Imager (SLI)\non-board the Huygens probe after landing have been analysed to identify any\npotential atmospheric features. In total, 82 SLI images were calibrated,\nprocessed and examined for features. The calibrated images show a smooth\nvertical radiance gradient across the images, with no other discernible\nfeatures. After mean-frame subtraction, six images contained an extended,\nhorizontal feature that had a radiance value that lay outside the 95%\nconfidence limit of the predicted radiance when compared to regions higher and\nlower in the images. The change in optical depth of these features were found\nto be between 0.005 and 0.014. It is considered that these features most likely\noriginate from the presence of a fog bank close to the horizon that rises and\nfalls during the period of observation.\n", "  On social media platforms, like Twitter, users are often interested in\ngaining more influence and popularity by growing their set of followers, aka\ntheir audience. Several studies have described the properties of users on\nTwitter based on static snapshots of their follower network. Other studies have\nanalyzed the general process of link formation. Here, rather than investigating\nthe dynamics of this process itself, we study how the characteristics of the\naudience and follower links change as the audience of a user grows in size on\nthe road to user's popularity.\n  To begin with, we find that the early followers tend to be more elite users\nthan the late followers, i.e., they are more likely to have verified and expert\naccounts. Moreover, the early followers are significantly more similar to the\nperson that they follow than the late followers. Namely, they are more likely\nto share time zone, language, and topics of interests with the followed user.\nTo some extent, these phenomena are related with the growth of Twitter itself,\nwherein the early followers tend to be the early adopters of Twitter, while the\nlate followers are late adopters. We isolate, however, the effect of the growth\nof audiences consisting of followers from the growth of Twitter's user base\nitself. Finally, we measure the engagement of such audiences with the content\nof the followed user, by measuring the probability that an early or late\nfollower becomes a retweeter.\n", "  A number of recent studies of information diffusion in social media, both\nempirical and theoretical, have been inspired by viral propagation models\nderived from epidemiology. These studies model the propagation of memes, i.e.,\npieces of information, between users in a social network similarly to the way\ndiseases spread in human society. Importantly, one would expect a meme to\nspread in a social network amongst the people who are interested in the topic\nof that meme. Yet, the importance of topicality for information diffusion has\nbeen less explored in the literature.\n  Here, we study empirical data about two different types of memes (hashtags\nand URLs) spreading through the Twitter's online social network. For every\nmeme, we infer its topics and for every user, we infer her topical interests.\nTo analyze the impact of such topics on the propagation of memes, we introduce\na novel theoretical framework of information diffusion. Our analysis identifies\ntwo distinct mechanisms, namely topical and non-topical, of information\ndiffusion. The non-topical information diffusion resembles disease spreading as\nin simple contagion. In contrast, the topical information diffusion happens\nbetween users who are topically aligned with the information and has\ncharacteristics of complex contagion. Non-topical memes spread broadly among\nall users and end up being relatively popular. Topical memes spread narrowly\namong users who have interests topically aligned with them and are diffused\nmore readily after multiple exposures. Our results show that the topicality of\nmemes and users' interests are essential for understanding and predicting\ninformation diffusion.\n", "  The large electric dipole moments associated with highly excited Rydberg\nstates of atoms and molecules make gas-phase samples in these states very well\nsuited to deceleration and trapping using inhomogeneous electric fields. The\nmethods of Rydberg-Stark deceleration with which this can be achieved are\nreviewed here. Using these techniques, the longitudinal motion of beams of\natoms and molecules moving at speeds as high as 2500~m/s have been manipulated,\nwith changes in kinetic energy of up to $|\\Delta\nE_{\\mathrm{kin}}|=1.3\\times10^{-20}$~J ($|\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{kin}}|/e=80$~meV or\n$|\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{kin}}|/hc=650$~cm$^{-1}$) achieved, while decelerated and\ntrapped samples with number densities of $10^6$--$10^7$~cm$^{-3}$ and\ntranslational temperatures of $\\sim150$~mK have been prepared. Applications of\nthese samples in areas of research at the interface between physics and\nphysical chemistry are discussed.\n", "  Social media sites are information marketplaces, where users produce and\nconsume a wide variety of information and ideas. In these sites, users\ntypically choose their information sources, which in turn determine what\nspecific information they receive, how much information they receive and how\nquickly this information is shown to them. In this context, a natural question\nthat arises is how efficient are social media users at selecting their\ninformation sources.\n  In this work, we propose a computational framework to quantify users'\nefficiency at selecting information sources. Our framework is based on the\nassumption that the goal of users is to acquire a set of unique pieces of\ninformation. To quantify user's efficiency, we ask if the user could have\nacquired the same pieces of information from another set of sources more\nefficiently. We define three different notions of efficiency -- link, in-flow,\nand delay -- corresponding to the number of sources the user follows, the\namount of (redundant) information she acquires and the delay with which she\nreceives the information. Our definitions of efficiency are general and\napplicable to any social media system with an underlying information network,\nin which every user follows others to receive the information they produce.\n  In our experiments, we measure the efficiency of Twitter users at acquiring\ndifferent types of information. We find that Twitter users exhibit sub-optimal\nefficiency across the three notions of efficiency, although they tend to be\nmore efficient at acquiring non-popular than popular pieces of information. We\nthen show that this lack of efficiency is a consequence of the triadic closure\nmechanism by which users typically discover and follow other users in social\nmedia. Finally, we develop a heuristic algorithm that enables users to be\nsignificantly more efficient at acquiring the same unique pieces of\ninformation.\n", "  We present the first systematic work for deriving a posteriori error\nestimates for general non-polynomial basis functions in an interior penalty\ndiscontinuous Galerkin (DG) formulation for solving eigenvalue problems\nassociated with second order linear operators. Eigenvalue problems of such\ntypes play important roles in scientific and engineering applications,\nparticularly in theoretical chemistry, solid state physics and material\nscience. Based on the framework developed in [{\\it L. Lin, B. Stamm,\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/m2an/2015069}] for second order PDEs, we develop\nresidual type upper and lower bound error estimates for measuring the a\nposteriori error for eigenvalue problems. The main merit of our method is that\nthe method is parameter-free, in the sense that all but one solution-dependent\nconstants appearing in the upper and lower bound estimates are explicitly\ncomputable by solving local and independent eigenvalue problems, and the only\nnon-computable constant can be reasonably approximated by a computable one\nwithout affecting the overall effectiveness of the estimates in practice.\nCompared to the PDE case, we find that a posteriori error estimators for\neigenvalue problems must neglect certain terms, which involves explicitly the\nexact eigenvalues or eigenfunctions that are not accessible in numerical\nsimulations. We define such terms carefully, and justify numerically that the\nneglected terms are indeed numerically high order terms compared to the\ncomputable estimators. Numerical results for a variety of problems in 1D and 2D\ndemonstrate that both the upper bound and lower bound are effective for\nmeasuring the error of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.\n", "  One goal of online social recommendation systems is to harness the wisdom of\ncrowds in order to identify high quality content. Yet the sequential voting\nmechanisms that are commonly used by these systems are at odds with existing\ntheoretical and empirical literature on optimal aggregation. This literature\nsuggests that sequential voting will promote herding---the tendency for\nindividuals to copy the decisions of others around them---and hence lead to\nsuboptimal content recommendation. Is there a problem with our practice, or a\nproblem with our theory? Previous attempts at answering this question have been\nlimited by a lack of objective measurements of content quality. Quality is\ntypically defined endogenously as the popularity of content in absence of\nsocial influence. The flaw of this metric is its presupposition that the\npreferences of the crowd are aligned with underlying quality. Domains in which\ncontent quality can be defined exogenously and measured objectively are thus\nneeded in order to better assess the design choices of social recommendation\nsystems. In this work, we look to the domain of education, where content\nquality can be measured via how well students are able to learn from the\nmaterial presented to them. Through a behavioral experiment involving a\nsimulated massive open online course (MOOC) run on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we\nshow that sequential voting systems can surface better content than systems\nthat elicit independent votes.\n", "  The quadrupole collectivity of low-lying states and the anomalous behavior of\nthe $0^+_2$ and $2^+_3$ levels in $^{72}$Ge are investigated via projectile\nmulti-step Coulomb excitation with GRETINA and CHICO-2. A total of forty six\n$E2$ and $M1$ matrix elements connecting fourteen low-lying levels were\ndetermined using the least-squares search code, gosia. Evidence for triaxiality\nand shape coexistence, based on the model-independent shape invariants deduced\nfrom the Kumar-Cline sum rule, is presented. These are interpreted using a\nsimple two-state mixing model as well as multistate mixing calculations carried\nout within the framework of the triaxial rotor model. The results represent a\nsignificant milestone towards the understanding of the unusual structure of\nthis nucleus.\n", "  Recent work by Webb {\\it et al.} has provided indications of spatial\nvariations of the fine-structure constant, $\\alpha$, at a level of a few parts\nper million. Using a dataset of 293 archival measurements, they further show\nthat a dipole provides a statistically good fit to the data, a result\nsubsequently confirmed by other authors. Here we show that a more recent\ndataset of dedicated measurements further constrains these variations: although\nthere are only 10 such measurements, their uncertainties are considerably\nsmaller. We find that a dipolar variation is still a good fit to the combined\ndataset, but the amplitude of such a dipole must be somewhat smaller:\n$8.1\\pm1.7$ ppm for the full dataset, versus $9.4\\pm2.2$ ppm for the Webb {\\it\net al.} data alone, both at the $68.3\\%$ confidence level. Constraints on the\ndirection on the sky of such a dipole are also significantly improved. On the\nother hand the data can't yet discriminate between a pure spatial dipole and\none with an additional redshift dependence.\n", "  In this paper we study segmented strings in AdS$_3$ coupled to a background\ntwo-form whose field strength is proportional to the volume form. By changing\nthe coupling, the theory interpolates between the Nambu-Goto string and the\n$SL(2)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model. In terms of the kink momentum vectors, the\naction is independent of the coupling and the classical theory reduces to a\nsingle discrete-time Toda-type theory. The WZW model is a singular point in\ncoupling space where the map into Toda variables degenerates.\n", "  The search for Earth-like planets using the transit technique has encouraged\nthe development of strategies to obtain light curves with increasingly\nprecision. In this context we developed the FOTOMCAp program. This is an IRAF\nquasi-automatic code which employs the aperture correction method and allows to\nobtain high-precision light curves. In this contribution we describe how this\ncode works and show the results obtained for planetary transits light curves.\n", "  The mutual control of the electric and magnetic properties of a multiferroic\nsolid is of fundamental and great technological importance. We report here on\nthe colossal magnetoelectric coupling effect of polycrystalline\nLa0.2Pb0.7Fe12O19. A large classic ferroelectric hysteresis loop with full\nsaturation and a strong magnetic hysteresis loop were observed simultaneously\nin polycrystalline La0.2Pb0.7Fe12O19 due to the coexistence of an off-centered\nFeO6 octahedron in its unit cell and electron spins in the partially filled 3d\norbits of the Fe3+ ions. The coupling voltage and capacity demonstrate giant\noscillations, along with magnetic field; the maximum magnetocapacitance ratio\nexceeds 1.9E5 at 80 Hz. The substitution of La ions with Pb ions progressively\nstabilized the conical spin structure, which gave rise to the spin-current\ninduced capacity oscillations upon magnetic field.\n", "  Neutrinos are neutral, spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particles which undergo only weak\ninteractions. The experimentally observed phenomenon of neutrino oscillation\nestablishes the fact that neutrinos are massive and there is mixing between\ndifferent neutrino flavours. This constitutes the first unambiguous hint\ntowards the physics Beyond Standard Model (BSM). In the BSM theories, the\nneutrino mass terms in the Lagrangian lead to the non-diagonal neutrino mass\nmatrix in the flavour basis which depends on neutrino mass and mixing\nparameters. Thus knowledge of the neutrino oscillation parameters and\nunderstanding the underlying symmetries of the neutrino mass matrix are very\nimportant as they can give an insight to the new physics beyond Standard Model.\nTherefore the measurement of different oscillation parameters and studying the\nstructure of the neutrino mass matrix are some of the main goals in neutrino\nphysics at present. In this thesis we have studied the potential of\npresent/future neutrino oscillation experiments and synergy between them to\ndetermine the unknown parameters in the neutrino sector in the light of current\nexperimental results. We have also studied the phenomenological consequences of\ntexture zeros in the neutrino mass matrices in the presence of a sterile\nneutrino.\n", "  International Large Detector (ILD) adopts Particle Flow Algorithm (PFA) for\nprecise measurement of multiple jets. The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) of\nILD has two candidates sensor technologies for PFA, which are pixelized silicon\nsensors and scintillator-strips with silicon photomultipliers. Pixelized\nsilicon sensors have higher granularity for PFA, however they have an issue of\ncost reduction. In contrast, scintillator-strips have an advantage of\nrelatively low cost and a disadvantage of degradation of position resolution by\nghost hits, which are generated by orthogonal arrangement. Hybrid ECAL using\nboth candidates is proposed to supplement these disadvantages. In this paper,\nwe report an optimization study of the hybrid ECAL using detector simulation.\n", "  To construct renormalizable gauge model in Bosonic-Fermionic noncommutative\n(BFNC) superspace, we replace the ordinary products of super Yang-Mills model\nby BFNC star products. To study the renormalization property of the deformed\naction, we obtain the one-loop 1PI effective action by using background field\nmethod at the first order of BFNC parameters. We also verify the BFNC\nsupergauge invariance of the effective action. Because there are new terms in\neffective action, the deformed action is not renormalizable. This imply that\nadditional terms should be added to the deformed action.\n", "  Earth and Moon are shown here to be composed of oxygen isotope reservoirs\nthat are indistinguishable, with a difference in {\\Delta}\"17O of -1 +/- 5ppm\n(2se). Based on these data and our new planet formation simulations that\ninclude a realistic model for oxygen isotopic reservoirs, our results favor\nvigorous mixing during the giant impact and therefore a high-energy high-\nangular-momentum impact. The results indicate that the late veneer impactors\nhad an average {\\Delta}\"17O within approximately 1 per mil of the terrestrial\nvalue, suggesting that these impactors were water rich.\n", "  A generalization of the Einstein equation is considered for complex line\nelements. Several second order semilinear partial differential equations are\nderived from it as semilinear field equations in uniform and isotropic spaces.\nThe nonrelativistic limits of the field equations are also considered. The\nroles of spatial variance are studied based on energy estimates,and several\ndissipative or antidissipative properties are remarked.\n", "  We investigate the noise in single layer graphene devices from equilibrium to\nfar from equilibrium and found that the 1/f noise shows an anomalous dependence\non the source-drain bias voltage (VSD). While the Hooge relation is not the\ncase around the charge neutrality point, we found that it is recovered at very\nlow VSD region. We propose that the depinning of the electron-hole puddles is\ninduced at finite VSD, which may explain this anomalous noise behavior.\n", "  Stimulated emission by black holes is discussed in light of the analogue\ngravity program. We first consider initial quantum states containing a definite\nnumber of particles, and then we take into account the case where the initial\nstate is a coherent state. The latter case is particularly significant in the\ncase where Hawking radiation is studied in dielectric black holes, and the\nemission is stimulated by a laser probe. We are particularly interested in the\ncase of the electromagnetic field, for which stimulated radiation is calculated\ntoo.\n", "  According to the planetary origin conceptual model proposed in this paper,\nthe protosun centre of the pre-solar nebula exploded, resulting in a shock wave\nthat passed through it and then returned to the centre, generating a new\nexplosion and shock wave. Recurrent explosions in the nebula resulted in a\nspherical standing sound wave, whose antinodes concentrated dust into rotating\nrings that transformed into planets. The extremely small angular momentum of\nthe Sun and the tilt of its equatorial plane were caused by the asymmetry of\nthe first, most powerful explosion. Differences between inner and outer planets\nare explained by the migration of solid matter, while the Oort cloud is\nexplained by the division of the pre-solar nebula into a spherical internal\nnebula and an expanding spherical shell of gas. The proposed conceptual model\ncan also explain the origin and evolution of exoplanetary systems and may be of\nuse in searching for new planets.\n", "  I present a simple variant of the Schr\\\"odinger cat meets Wigner's friend\nthought experiment. If you are shocked by it, you have not understood quantum\nphysics (no words are missing from this sentence).\n", "  The form factors of the semileptonic $\\chi_{b2}(1P)\\rightarrow\nB_{c}\\bar{l}\\nu$ decay are calculated using the QCD sum rule approach. The\nresults obtained are then used to estimate the decay widths of this transition\nin all lepton channels. The orders of decay rates indicate that this transition\nis accessible at LHC for all lepton channels.\n", "  We recently proved threshold saturation for spatially coupled sparse\nsuperposition codes on the additive white Gaussian noise channel. Here we\ngeneralize our analysis to a much broader setting. We show for any memoryless\nchannel that spatial coupling allows generalized approximate message-passing\n(GAMP) decoding to reach the potential (or Bayes optimal) threshold of the code\nensemble. Moreover in the large input alphabet size limit: i) the GAMP\nalgorithmic threshold of the underlying (or uncoupled) code ensemble is simply\nexpressed as a Fisher information; ii) the potential threshold tends to\nShannon's capacity. Although we focus on coding for sake of coherence with our\nprevious results, the framework and methods are very general and hold for a\nwide class of generalized estimation problems with random linear mixing.\n", "  Graphenic carbon (GC) x-ray transmission windows for EDX and XRF applications\nwith a high transparency for x-rays below 2.5 keV have been fabricated on 6\ninch wafers with a CMOS-compatible CVD process. GC windows with an open\ndiameter of 7.4 mm and a thickness of 770 nm withstand up to 6.5 bars of\ndifferential pressure. A high transmissivity of 40 % for fluorine K{\\alpha}\n(0.677 keV) radiation is demonstrated for a GC thickness of 650 nm. The GC\nmembranes outperform beryllium (Be) windows, in terms of higher x-ray\ntransmission and better mechanical stability while avoiding the toxicity of Be.\nOptical profilometry has been employed to visualize a large deformation of the\nGC layer during the window fabrication. This seems to limit the thickness of\nthe GC windows that can currently be fabricated. A two-step growth process can\novercome these limitations and windows with a thickness of up to 6 {\\mu}m have\nbeen realized.\n", "  Within the scope of Bianchi type-III spacetime we study the role of spinor\nfield on the evolution of the Universe as well as the influence of gravity on\nthe spinor field. In doing so we have considered a polynomial type of\nnonlinearity. In this case the spacetime remains locally rotationally symmetric\nand anisotropic all the time. It is found that depending on the sign of\nnonlinearity the models allows both accelerated and oscillatory modes of\nexpansion. The non-diagonal components of energy-momentum tensor though impose\nsome restrictions on metric functions and components of spinor field, unlike\nBianchi type I, V and $VI_0$ cases, they do not lead to vanishing mass and\nnonlinear terms of the spinor field.\n", "  We present a hybrid continuum-atomistic scheme which combines molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations with on-the-fly machine learning techniques for the\naccurate and efficient prediction of multiscale fluidic systems. By using a\nGaussian process as a surrogate model for the computationally expensive MD\nsimulations, we use Bayesian inference to predict the system behaviour at the\natomistic scale, purely by consideration of the macroscopic inputs and outputs.\nWhenever the uncertainty of this prediction is greater than a predetermined\nacceptable threshold, a new MD simulation is performed to continually augment\nthe database, which is never required to be complete. This provides a\nsubstantial enhancement to the current generation of hybrid methods, which\noften require many similar atomistic simulations to be performed, discarding\ninformation after it is used once.\n  We apply our hybrid scheme to nano-confined unsteady flow through a\nhigh-aspect-ratio converging-diverging channel, and make comparisons between\nthe new scheme and full MD simulations for a range of uncertainty thresholds\nand initial databases. For low thresholds, our hybrid solution is highly\naccurate\\,---\\,within the thermal noise of a full MD simulation. As the\nuncertainty threshold is raised, the accuracy of our scheme decreases and the\ncomputational speed-up increases (relative to a full MD simulation), enabling\nthe compromise between precision and efficiency to be tuned. The speed-up of\nour hybrid solution ranges from an order of magnitude, with no initial\ndatabase, to cases where an extensive initial database ensures no new MD\nsimulations are required.\n", "  We consider an open quantum system described by a Lindblad-type master\nequation with two times-scales. The fast time-scale is strongly dissipative and\ndrives the system towards a low-dimensional decoherence-free space. To perform\nthe adiabatic elimination of this fast relaxation, we propose a geometric\nasymptotic expansion based on the small positive parameter describing the\ntime-scale separation. This expansion exploits geometric singular perturbation\ntheory and center-manifold techniques. We conjecture that, at any order, it\nprovides an effective slow Lindblad master equation and a completely positive\nparameterization of the slow invariant sub-manifold associated to the\nlow-dimensional decoherence-free space. By preserving complete positivity and\ntrace, two important structural properties attached to open quantum dynamics,\nwe obtain a reduced-order model that directly conveys a physical interpretation\nsince it relies on effective Lindbladian descriptions of the slow evolution. At\nthe first order, we derive simple formulae for the effective Lindblad master\nequation. For a specific type of fast dissipation, we show how any Hamiltonian\nperturbation yields Lindbladian second-order corrections to the first-order\nslow evolution governed by the Zeno-Hamiltonian. These results are illustrated\non a composite system made of a strongly dissipative harmonic oscillator, the\nancilla, weakly coupled to another quantum system.\n", "  Bootstrap percolation is a well-known activation process in a graph, in which\na node becomes active when it has at least $r$ active neighbors. Such process,\noriginally studied on regular structures, has been recently investigated also\nin the context of random graphs, where it can serve as a simple model for a\nwide variety of cascades, such as the spreading of ideas, trends, viral\ncontents, etc. over large social networks. In particular, it has been shown\nthat in $G(n,p)$ the final active set can exhibit a phase transition for a\nsub-linear number of seeds. In this paper, we propose a unique framework to\nstudy similar sub-linear phase transitions for a much broader class of graph\nmodels and epidemic processes. Specifically, we consider i) a generalized\nversion of bootstrap percolation in $G(n,p)$ with random activation thresholds\nand random node-to-node influences; ii) different random graph models,\nincluding graphs with given degree sequence and graphs with community structure\n(block model). The common thread of our work is to show the surprising\nsensitivity of the critical seed set size to extreme values of distributions,\nwhich makes some systems dramatically vulnerable to large-scale outbreaks. We\nvalidate our results running simulation on both synthetic and real graphs.\n", "  We have studied the multifractality of pion emission process in 16O-AgBr\ninteractions at 2.1AGeV & 60AGeV, 12CAgBr &24Mg-AgBr interactions at 4.5AGeV\nand 32S-AgBr interactions at 200AGeV using Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation\nAnalysis (MFDFA) method which is capable of extracting the actual multifractal\nproperty filtering out the average trend of fluctuation. The analysis revels\nthat the pseudo rapidity distribution of the shower particles is multifractal\nin nature for all the interactions i.e. pion production mechanism has in built\nmulti-scale self-similarity property. We have employed MFDFA method for\nrandomly generated events for 32S-AgBr interactions at 200 AGeV. Comparison of\nexpt. results with those obtained from randomly generated data set reveals that\nthe source of multifractality in our data is the presence of long range\ncorrelation. Comparing the results obtained from different interactions, it may\nbe concluded that strength of multifractality decreases with projectile mass\nfor same projectile energy and for a particular projectile it increases with\nenergy. The values of ordinary Hurst exponent suggest that there is long range\ncorrelation present in our data for all the interactions.\n", "  We identify the chiral and angular momentum content of the leading\nquark-antiquark Fock component for the $\\rho(770)$ and $\\rho(1450)$ mesons\nusing a two-flavor lattice simulation with dynamical Overlap Dirac fermions. We\nextract this information from the overlap factors of two interpolating fields\nwith different chiral structure and from the unitary transformation between\nchiral and angular momentum basis. For the chiral content of the mesons we find\nthat the $\\rho(770)$ slightly favors the $(1,0)\\oplus(0,1)$ chiral\nrepresentation and the $\\rho(1450)$ slightly favors the $(1/2,1/2)_b$ chiral\nrepresentation. In the angular momentum basis the $\\rho(770)$ is then a $^3S_1$\nstate, in accordance with the quark model. The $\\rho(1450)$ is a $^3D_1$ state,\nshowing that the quark model wrongly assumes the $\\rho(1450)$ to be a radial\nexcitation of the $\\rho(770)$.\n", "  Silicon spintronics requires injection of spin-polarized carriers into Si. An\nemerging approach is direct electrical injection from a ferromagnetic\nsemiconductor - EuO being the prime choice. Functionality of the EuO/Si spin\ncontact is determined by the interface band alignment. In particular, the band\noffset should fall within the 0.5-2 eV range. We employ soft-X-ray ARPES to\nprobe the electronic structure of the buried EuO/Si interface with momentum\nresolution and chemical specificity. The band structure reveals a conduction\nband offset of 1.0 eV attesting the technological potential of the EuO/Si\nsystem.\n", "  The dropwise condensation underneath a horizontal super-hydrophobic surface\nhaving unidirectional wettability gradient is modeled with implication to\nenhance the rate of condensation. The mathematical model includes nucleation,\ngrowth by vapor condensation and coalescence, and drop instability arising from\nforce imbalances at the three-phase contact line. The wettability graded\nsurfaces, formed by a variable surface energy coating, allow the micro-drop of\ncondensate to slide from the hydrophobic to the hydrophilic region without the\naid of gravity. The resulting decrease in the drop sliding size shifts the drop\nsize distribution to smaller radii. Furthermore, this decrease in sliding size\nenhances the heat transfer rate during dropwise condensation. Simulation data\nhas been compared with condensation patterns for a horizontal surface and\ninclined surface, both with zero wettability gradients. Results obtained show\nthat a wettability graded surface can effectively control the condensation\nprocess by decreasing the cycle time of nucleation, growth and removal.\n", "  The classical system of shallow-water (Saint--Venant) equations describes\nlong surface waves in an inviscid incompressible fluid of a variable depth.\nAlthough shock waves are expected in this quasilinear hyperbolic system for a\nwide class of initial data, we find a sufficient condition on the initial data\nthat guarantees existence of a global classical solution continued from a local\nsolution. The sufficient conditions can be easily satisfied for the fluid flow\npropagating in one direction with two characteristic velocities of the same\nsign and two monotonically increasing Riemann invariants. We prove that these\nproperties persist in the time evolution of the classical solutions to the\nshallow-water equations and provide no shock wave singularities formed in a\nfinite time over a half-line or an infinite line. On a technical side, we\ndevelop a novel method of an additional argument, which allows to obtain local\nand global solutions to the quasilinear hyperbolic systems in physical rather\nthan characteristic variables.\n", "  Sequential activation of neurons is a common feature of network activity\nduring a variety of behaviors, including working memory and decision making.\nPrevious network models for sequences and memory emphasized specialized\narchitectures in which a principled mechanism is pre-wired into their\nconnectivity. Here we demonstrate that, starting from random connectivity and\nmodifying a small fraction of connections, a largely disordered recur- rent\nnetwork can produce sequences and implement working memory efficiently. We use\nthis process, called Partial In-Network Training (PINning), to model and match\ncellular resolution imaging data from the posterior parietal cortex during a\nvirtual memory- guided two-alternative forced-choice task. Analysis of the\nconnectivity reveals that sequences propagate by the cooperation between\nrecurrent synaptic interactions and external inputs, rather than through\nfeedforward or asymmetric connections. Together our results suggest that neural\nsequences may emerge through learning from largely unstructured network\narchitectures.\n", "  A discrete gradient model for interfaces is studied. The interaction\npotential is a non-convex perturbation of the quadratic gradient potential.\nBased on a representation for the finite volume Gibbs measure obtained via a\nrenormalization group analysis by Adams, Koteck\\'{y} and M\\\"uller in [AKM] it\nis proven that the scaling limit is a continuum massless Gaussian free field.\nFrom probabilistic point of view, this is a Central Limit Theorem for strongly\ndependent random fields. Additionally, the convergence of covariances, smoothed\non a scale smaller than the system size, is proven.\n", "  Low temperature ultrasound velocity measurements are presented on the\nfrustrated spin system SrDy2O4 that allow us to define high resolution phase\ndiagrams with the magnetic field applied along all three principal axes. For\nH||b, a region of field-induced long range order is delimited by a dome of\nfirst-order phase transitions. An unusual magnetization process is observed\nwith significant irreversibility at very low temperatures when passing between\nthe low-field spin liquid phase and the long range ordered phase which we\nattribute to large energy barriers. For H||c, the system appears to remain\neffectively one-dimensional, exhibiting two transitions as a function of\nmagnetic field, but no finite-temperature long range order.\n", "  Magnetic confinement fusion reactors suffer severely from heat and particle\nlosses through turbulent transport, which has inspired the construction of ever\nlarger and more expensive reactors. Numerical simulations are vital to their\ndesign and operation, but particle collisions are too infrequent for fluid\ndescriptions to be valid. Instead, strongly magnetised fusion plasmas are\ndescribed by the gyrokinetic equations, a nonlinear integro-differential system\nfor evolving the particle distribution functions in a five-dimensional position\nand velocity space, and the consequent electromagnetic field. Due to the high\ndimensionality, simulations of small reactor sections require hundreds of\nthousands of CPU hours on High Performance Computing platforms.\n  We develop a Hankel-Hermite spectral representation for velocity space that\nexploits structural features of the gyrokinetic system. The representation\nexactly conserves discrete free energy in the absence of explicit dissipation,\nwhile our Hermite hypercollision operator captures Landau damping with few\nvariables. Calculation of the electromagnetic fields becomes purely local,\neliminating inter-processor communication in, and vastly accelerating, searches\nfor linear instabilities. We implement these ideas in SpectroGK, an efficient\nparallel code.\n  Turbulent fusion plasmas may dissipate free energy through linear phase\nmixing to fine scales in velocity space, as in Landau damping, or through a\nnonlinear cascade to fine scales in physical space, as in hydrodynamic\nturbulence. Using SpectroGK to study saturated electrostatic drift-kinetic\nturbulence, we find that the nonlinear cascade suppresses linear phase mixing\nat energetically-dominant scales, so the turbulence is fluid-like. We use this\nobservation to derive Fourier-Hermite spectra for the electrostatic potential\nand distribution function, and confirm these spectra with simulations.\n", "  We review recent advances and results in enhancing and developing\nhelioseismic analysis methods and in solar data assimilation. In the first part\nof this paper we will focus on selected developments in time-distance and\nglobal helioseismology. In the second part, we review the application of data\nassimilation methods on solar data. Relating solar surface observations as well\nas helioseismic proxies with solar dynamo models by means of the techniques\nfrom data assimilation is a promising new approach to explore and to predict\nthe magnetic activity cycle of the Sun.\n", "  In the present work the second Stokes problem about behaviour of the rarefied\ngas filling half-space is formulated. A plane limiting half-space makes\nharmonious fluctuations with variable amplitude in the plane. The amplitude\nchanges on the exponential law. The kinetic equation with model integral of\ncollisions in the form $\\tau$-model is used. The case of diffusion reflexions\nof gas molecules from a wall is considered. Eigen solutions (continuous modes)\nof the initial kinetic equation corresponding to the continuous spectrum are\nsearched. Properties of dispersion function are studied. It is investigated the\ndiscrete spectrum of the problem consisting of zero of the dispersion functions\nin the complex plane. It is shown, that number of zero of dispersion function\nto equally doubled index of problem coefficient. The problem coefficient is\nunderstood as the relation of boundary values of dispersion function from above\nand from below on the real axis. Further are eigen solutions (discrete modes)\nof the initial kinetic equation corresponding to the discrete spectrum are\nsearched. In the end of work the general solution of the kinetic equation in\nthe form expansion under eigen solutions with unknown coefficients\ncorresponding to discrete and continuous spectra is constructed.\n", "  This is an invited short update of the topic covered by the review article,\nwhich aims to briefly survey progress made in theoretical and experimental\nstudies of multidimensional solitons since the publication of the review. The\nCommentary was invited as an addition to the original review article that will\nbe reprinted in an e-book celebrating the 50th anniversary of Journal of\nPhysics B (incorporating Journal of Optics B: Quantum and Semiclassical\nOptics).\n", "  This work describes morphological and crystalline properties of the InAs\nislands grown on templates created by focused ion beam (FIB) on indium\nphosphide (InP) substrates. Regular arrangements of shallow holes are created\non the InP (001) surfaces, acting as preferential nucleation sites for InAs\nislands grown by Metal-Organic Vapor Phase Epitaxy. Ion doses ranging from\n$10^{15}$ to $10^{16}$ $Ga^{+}$/$cm^{2}$ were used and islands were grown for\ntwo sub-monolayer coverages. We observe the formation of clusters in the inner\nsurfaces of the FIB produced cavities and show that for low doses templates the\nnanostructures are mainly coherent while templates created with large ion doses\nlead to the growth of incoherent islands with larger island density. The\nmodified island growth is described by a simple model based on the surface\npotential and the net adatom flow to the cavities. We observe that obtained\nmorphologies result from a competition between coarsening and coalescence\nmechanisms.\n", "  The R Coronae Australis dark cloud is one of the closest star-forming regions\nto the Sun. The cloud is known to be very active in star formation, harboring\nmany Herbig-Haro objects (HHs) and Molecular Hydrogen emission-line Objects\n(MHOs). In this work we present results from molecular observations (a\n$5.5^{'}\\times5.5^{'}$ map of $^{12}$CO J$=3-2$ and HCO$^{+}$ J$=4-3$, and a\nsingle spectrum of N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ J$=4-3$) obtained with the Atacama\nSubmillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE) towards the R CrA dark cloud with an\nangular and spectral resolution of 22$^{\"}$ and 0.11 km s$^{-1}$, respectively.\nFrom the $^{12}$CO J$=3-2$ line we found kinematical spectral features strongly\nsuggesting the presence of outflows towards a region populated by several HHs\nand MHOs. Moreover, most of these objects lie within an HCO$^{+}$ maximum,\nsuggesting that its emission arises from an increasement of its abundance due\nto the chemistry triggered by the outflow activity. Additionally, we are\npresenting the first reported detection of N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ in the J$=4-3$ line\ntowards the R CrA dark cloud.\n", "  Microelectromechanical systems, which can be moved or rotated with nanometre\nprecision, already find applications in such fields like radio-frequency\nelectronics, micro-attenuators, sensors and many others. Especially interesting\nare those which allow fine control over the motion on atomic scale due to\nself-alignment mechanisms and forces acting on the atomic level. Such machines\ncan produce well-controlled movements as a reaction to small changes of the\nexternal parameters. Here we demonstrate that, for the system of graphene on\nhexagonal boron nitride, the interplay between the van der Waals and elastic\nenergies results in graphene mechanically self-rotating towards the hexagonal\nboron nitride crystallographic directions. Such rotation is macroscopic (for\ngraphene flakes of tens of micrometres the tangential movement can be on\nhundreds of nanometres) and can be used for reproducible manufacturing of\naligned van der Waals heterostructures.\n", "  Quantum state discrimination between two wave functions on a ring is\nconsidered. The optimal minimum-error probability is known to be given by the\nHelstrom bound. A new strategy is introduced by inserting instantaneously two\nimpenetrable barriers dividing the ring into two chambers. In the process, the\ncandidate wave functions, as the insertion points become nodes, get entangled\nwith the barriers and can, if judiciously chosen, be distinguished with smaller\nerror probability. As a consequence, the Helstrom bound under idealised\nconditions can be violated.\n", "  We demonstrate fiber Fabry-Perot (FFP) cavities with concave mirrors that can\nbe operated at cavity lengths as large as 1.5mm without significant\ndeterioration of the finesse. This is achieved by using a laser dot machining\ntechnique to shape spherical mirrors with ultralow roughness and employing\nsingle-mode fibers with large mode area for good mode matching to the cavity.\nAdditionally, in contrast to previous FFPs, these cavities can be used over an\noctave-spanning frequency range with adequate coatings. We also show directly\nthat shape deviations caused by the fiber's index profile lead to a finesse\ndecrease as observed in earlier attempts to build long FFP cavities, and show a\nway to overcome this problem.\n", "  In this work, we present the f(R)-Einstein-Palatini formalism in arbitrary\ndimensions and the study of consistency applied to brane models, the so-called\nbraneworld sum rules. We show that it is possible a scenario of thick branes in\nfive dimensions with compact extra dimension in the framework of the\nf(R)-Einstein-Palatini theory by the accomplishment of an assertive criteria.\n", "  Properties of the yrast states of a system of $N$ bosons confined to a\none-dimensional ring and interacting via contact forces is examined both\nvariationally and by numerical diagonalizations. The latter allow for obtaining\nnumerical correlated many-body wave functions explicitly. The study of\ncorrelation functions involving different yrast states indicates that a quantum\nphase transition previously detected in the properties of the ground state in\nthe case of attractive two-body interactions is an yrast phenomenon involving\nthe onset of `deformation', in the sense given to this term by Bohr and\nMottelson in connection with the description of nuclear spectra, including\nenhanced transition operators and emergence of a shared intrinsic correlation\nstructure. In this case the moment of inertia of the deformed state is\nessentially the rigid moment of inertia, `intrinsic' states being essentially\ndegenerate.\n", "  Rapid advances in modern communication technology are enabling the\naccumulation of large-scale, high-resolution observational data of\nspatiotemporal movements of humans. Classification and prediction of human\nmobility based on the analysis of such data carry great potential in\napplications such as urban planning as well as being of theoretical interest. A\nrobust theoretical framework is therefore required to study and properly\nunderstand human motion. Here we perform the eigenmode analysis of human motion\ndata gathered from mobile communication records, which allows us to explore the\nscaling properties and characteristics of human motion.\n", "  Online social media such as Twitter are widely used for mining public\nopinions and sentiments on various issues and topics. The sheer volume of the\ndata generated and the eager adoption by the online-savvy public are helping to\nraise the profile of online media as a convenient source of news and public\nopinions on social and political issues as well. Due to the uncontrollable\nbiases in the population who heavily use the media, however, it is often\ndifficult to measure how accurately the online sphere reflects the offline\nworld at large, undermining the usefulness of online media. One way of\nidentifying and overcoming the online-offline discrepancies is to apply a\ncommon analytical and modeling framework to comparable data sets from online\nand offline sources and cross-analyzing the patterns found therein. In this\npaper we study the political spectra constructed from Twitter and from\nlegislators' voting records as an example to demonstrate the potential limits\nof online media as the source for accurate public opinion mining.\n", "  Recently, Keane et al. reported the discovery of a fading radio transient\nfollowing FRB 150418, and interpreted it as the afterglow of the FRB. Williams\n\\& Berger, on the other hand, suggested that the radio transient is analogous\nto a group of variable radio sources, so that it could be a coincident AGN\nflare in the observational beam of the FRB. A new observation with VLA showed a\nre-brightening, which is consistent with the AGN picture. Here, using the radio\nsurvey data of Ofek et al., we statistically examine the chance coincidence\nprobability to produce an event like the FRB 150418 transient. We find that the\nprobabilities to produce a variable radio transient with at least the same\nvariability amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio as the FRB 150415 transient,\nwithout and with the VLA point, are $P_1 \\sim 6 \\times 10^{-4}$ and $P_1 \\sim 2\n\\times 10^{-3}$, respectively. In addition, the chance probability to have a\nfading transient detected following a random time (FRB time) is less than $P_2\n\\sim 10^{-2.9\\pm 1.3}$. Putting these together and assuming that the number of\nradio sources within one Parkes beam is 16, the final chance coincidence of\nhaving an FRB 150418-like radio transient to be unrelated to the FRB is $<\n10^{-4.9\\pm1.3}$ and $< 10^{-4.4\\pm1.3}$, respectively, without and with the\nVLA point. We conclude that the radio transient following FRB 150418 has a low\nprobability being an unrelated AGN flare, and the possibility of being the\nafterglow of FRB 150418 is not ruled out.\n", "  Future soft X-ray (10 - 50 Angstrom) spectroscopy missions require higher\neffective areas and resolutions to perform critical science that cannot be done\nby instruments on current missions. An X-ray grating spectrometer employing\noff-plane reflection gratings would be capable of meeting these performance\ncriteria. Off-plane gratings with blazed groove facets operated in the Littrow\nmounting can be used to achieve excellent throughput into orders achieving high\nresolutions. We have fabricated two off-plane gratings with blazed groove\nprofiles via a technique which uses commonly available microfabrication\nprocesses, is easily scaled for mass production, and yields gratings customized\nfor a given mission architecture. Both fabricated gratings were tested in the\nLittrow mounting at the Max-Planck-Institute for extraterrestrial Physics\nPANTER X-ray test facility to assess their performance. The line spread\nfunctions of diffracted orders were measured, and a maximum resolution of 800\n$\\pm$ 20 is reported. In addition, we also observe evidence of a `blaze' effect\nfrom measurements of relative efficiencies of the diffracted orders.\n", "  We study repulsive Hubbard and t-J type systems on a square lattice (long\nbelieved to capture certain quintessential aspects of the high temperature\nsuperconductors). These models (alongside the parent compounds of the high\ntemperature superconductors) are antiferromagnetic in the absence of hole\ndoping. As we illustrate, a unifying underlying principle for the dynamics of\nholes introduced by doping rationalizes the emergence of nonuniform electronic\nstructures- \"stripes\" and possible pairing tendencies therein. Specifically,\nour analysis invokes the following (numerically verified) sublattice parity\nprinciple: a strong antiferromagnetic background forces injected holes to hop\nin steps of two such that they always remain on the same sub lattice. When\napplied to a domain wall in an antiferromagnet, this simple principle naturally\ngives rise to (bond centered) stripes. We demonstrate that the holes are\nself-consistently localized on stripes. Extending this picture, we then show\nthat the holes on a stripe favor the formation of pairs on neighboring rungs or\nsites. Throughout this work much emphasis is placed on the problem of a two leg\nladder immersed in a staggered magnetic field. Although we will focus on the\nsquare lattice, our considerations may be extended to similar electronic\nstructures appearing in other models on bipartite lattices when these exhibit\nantiferromagnetic correlations with an underlying sublattice structure.\n", "  Equilibrium statistical mechanics is intended to link the microscopic\ndynamics of particles to the thermodynamic laws for macroscopic quantities.\nHowever, the modern statistical theory is faced with significant difficulties,\nas applied to description of the macroscopic properties of real condensed media\nwithin wide thermodynamic ranges, including the vicinities of the phase\ntransition points. A particular problem is the absence of metastable states in\nthe Gibbs statistical mechanics of the systems composed of finite number of\nparticles. Nevertheless, accordance between equilibrium statistical mechanics\nand thermodynamics of condensed media is achievable if to take account of the\nmutual correlation (the feedback) between the microscopic properties of\nmolecules and the macrostate of the corresponding medium. This can be done via\nusage of the \"enhanced\" Hamilton operator of the considered many-particle\nsystem, which contains some temperature-dependent term(s), and the following\nintroduction of the generalized equilibrium distribution over microstates. For\nillustration of the reasonableness of the proposed approach (and of its\navailability in practical applications), a cell model of\nmelting/crystallization and metastable supercooled liquid for a water-like\nmedium is presented.\n", "  The 1/r Coulomb potential is calculated for a two dimensional system with\nperiodic boundary conditions. Using polynomial splines in real space and a\nsummation in reciprocal space we obtain numerically optimized potentials which\nallow us efficient calculations of any periodic (long-ranged) potential up to\nhigh precision. We discuss the parameter space of the optimized potential for\nthe periodic Coulomb potential. Compared to the analytic Ewald potential, the\noptimized potentials can reach higher precisions by up to several orders of\nmagnitude. We explicitly give simple expressions for fast calculations of the\nperiodic Coulomb potential where the summation in reciprocal space is reduced\nto a few terms.\n", "  It is seen that issues of unitarity raised by the evolution of the wave\nfunction in curved spacetime can be resolved by describing the evolution of\nquantum states in Minkowski tangent space. The treatment adheres closely to the\northodox interpretation that the wave function is not physical but is part of a\nmathematical method for the calculation of probabilities of measurement\nresults. Minkowski tangent space refers to a non-physical configuration space\nused to describe quantum mechanics. The teleconnection is defined between\nHilbert spaces at different points in spacetime motivated by arguments from the\nprobability interpretation. The teleconnection is analogous to a connection\nbetween vector spaces and reduces to the Levi-Civita connection in the limit of\nnear initial and final measurements. Predictions for quantum theory in curved\nspacetime agree with those of classical general relativity.\n", "  This book is an attempt to build a consistent relativistic quantum theory of\ninteracting particles. In the first part of the book \"Quantum electrodynamics\"\nwe follow rather traditional approach to particle physics. Our discussion\nproceeds systematically from the principle of relativity and postulates of\nquantum measurements to the renormalization in quantum electrodynamics. In the\nsecond part of the book \"Quantum theory of particles\" this traditional approach\nis reexamined. We find that formulas of special relativity should be modified\nto take into account particle interactions. We also suggest reinterpreting\nquantum field theory in the language of physical \"dressed\" particles. This\nformulation eliminates the need for renormalization and opens up a new way for\nstudying dynamical and bound state properties of quantum interacting systems.\nThe developed theory is applied to realistic physical objects and processes\nincluding the energy spectrum of the hydrogen atom, the decay law of moving\nunstable particles, and the electric field of relativistic electron beams.\nThese results force us to take a fresh look at some core issues of modern\nparticle theories, in particular, the Minkowski space-time unification, the\nrole of quantum fields and renormalization as well as the alleged impossibility\nof action-at-a-distance. A new perspective on these issues is suggested. It can\nhelp to solve the old problem of theoretical physics -- a consistent\nunification of relativity and quantum mechanics.\n", "  Ranking a set of objects from the most dominant one to the least, based on\nthe results of paired comparisons, proves to be useful in many contexts. Using\nthe rankings of teams or individuals players in sports to seed tournaments is\nan example. The quality of a ranking is often evaluated by the number of\nviolations, cases in which an object is ranked lower than another that it has\ndominated in a comparison, that it contains. A minimum violations ranking (MVR)\nmethod, as its name suggests, searches specifically for rankings that have the\nminimum possible number of violations which may or may not be zero. In this\npaper, we present a method based on statistical physics that overcomes\nconceptual and practical difficulties faced by earlier studies of the problem.\n", "  The reversion of the time evolution of a quantum state can be achieved by\nchanging the sign of the Hamiltonian as in the polarization echo experiment in\nNMR. In this work we describe an alternative mechanism inspired by the acoustic\ntime reversal mirror. By solving the inverse time problem in a discrete space\nwe develop a new procedure, the perfect inverse filter. It achieves the exact\ntime reversion in a given region by reinjecting a prescribed wave function at\nits periphery.\n"]}
