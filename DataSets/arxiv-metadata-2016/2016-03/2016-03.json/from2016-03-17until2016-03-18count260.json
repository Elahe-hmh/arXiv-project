"None"], "abstract": ["  Stars that are collapsing toward forming a black hole but are frozen near the\nSchwarzschild horizon are termed \"black stars\". Collisions of black stars, in\ncontrast to black hole collisions, may be sources of gamma ray bursts, whose\nbasic parameters are estimated quite simply and are found to be consistent with\nobserved gamma ray bursts. Black star gamma ray bursts should be preceded by\ngravitational wave emission similar to that from the coalescence of black\nholes.\n", "  We consider the Hamiltonian system consisting of a Klein-Gordon vector field\nand a particle in $\\R^3$. The initial date of the system is a random function\nwith a finite mean density of energy which also satisfies a Rosenblatt- or\nIbragimov-type mixing condition. Moreover, initial correlation functions are\ntranslation-invariant. We study the distribution $\\mu_t$ of the solution at\ntime $t\\in\\R$. The main result is the convergence of $\\mu_t$ to a Gaussian\nmeasure as $t\\to\\infty$, where $\\mu_\\infty$ is translation-invariant.\n", "  The survival problem for a diffusing particle moving among random traps is\nconsidered. We introduce a simple argument to derive the quenched asymptotics\nof the survival probability from the Lifshitz tail effect for the associated\noperator. In particular, the upper bound is proved in fairly general settings\nand is shown to be sharp in the case of the Brownian motion in the Poissonian\nobstacles. As an application, we derive the quenched asymptotics for the\nBrownian motion in traps distributed according to a random perturbation of the\nlattice.\n", "  Assuming an effective gravitational action with scale dependent coupling\nconstants, a consistency condition for the local form of the cut-off scale is\nderived. The approach is applied to homogeneous cosmology and running couplings\nwith an ultraviolet fixed point. Within the given approach this allows to\nderive bounds on the value of the fixed point.\n", "  We study the quasiparticle energy relaxation processes in superconducting Nb\nfilms of different thicknesses corresponding to different electron mean free\npaths in a state far from equilibrium, that is the highly dissipative flux-flow\nstate driven up to the instability point. From the measured current-voltage\ncurves we derive the vortex critical velocity $v^{*}$ for several temperatures.\nFrom the $v^{*}(T)$ values, the quasiparticle energy relaxation time\n$\\tau_{\\epsilon}$ is evaluated within the Larkin-Ovchinnikov model and\nnumerical calculations of the quasiparticle energy relaxation rates are carried\nout to support the experimental findings. Besides the expected constant\nbehavior of $\\tau_{\\epsilon}(T)$ for the dirty samples, we observe a strong\ntemperature dependence of the quasiparticle energy relaxation time in the clean\nsamples. This feature is associated with the increasing contribution from the\nelectron-phonon scattering process as the dirty limit is approached from the\nclean regime.\n", "  These lectures discuss an S-matrix approach to quantum gravity, and its\nrelation to more local spacetime approaches. Prominent among the problems of\nquantum gravity are those of unitarity and observables. In a unitary theory\nwith solutions approximating Minkowski space, the S-matrix (or, in four\ndimensions, related inclusive probabilities) should be sharply formulated and\nphysical. Features of its perturbative description are reviewed. A successful\nquantum gravity theory should in particular address the questions posed by the\nultrahigh-energy regime. Some control can be gained in this regime by varying\nthe impact parameter as well as the collision energy. However, with decreasing\nimpact parameter gravity becomes strong, first eikonalizing, and then entering\nthe regime where in the classical approximation black holes form. Here one\nconfronts what may be the most profound problem of quantum gravity, that of\nproviding unitary amplitudes, as seen through the information problem of black\nhole evaporation. Existing approaches to quantum gravity leave a number of\nunanswered questions in this regime; there are strong indications that new\nprinciples and mechanisms are needed, and in particular there is a good case\nthat usual notions of locality are inaccurate. One approach to these questions\nis investigation of the approximate local dynamics of spacetime, its\nobservables, and its limitations; another is to directly explore properties of\nthe gravitational S-matrix, such as analyticity, crossing, and others implied\nby gravitational physics.\n", "  We investigate the bismuth (111) surface by means of time and angle resolved\nphotoelectron spectroscopy. The parallel detection of the surface states below\nand above the Fermi level reveals a giant anisotropy of the Spin-Orbit (SO)\nspitting. These strong deviations from the Rashba-like coupling cannot be\ntreated in $\\textbf{k}\\cdot \\textbf{p}$ perturbation theory. Instead, first\nprinciple calculations could accurately reproduce the experimental dispersion\nof the electronic states. Our analysis shows that the giant anisotropy of the\nSO splitting is due to a large out-of plane buckling of the spin and orbital\ntexture.\n", "  In this work it is studied a generalization of Randall Sundrum model. It is\nobtained new behaviors of {\\it warp factor}, constraints in that the strong\nbrane has tension of positive sign and, new relations between the coupling\nconstants $\\kappa_4$, $\\kappa_5$ and between the Higgs and Planck masses.\n", "  We show that the Lagrangian of classical mechanics on a Riemannian manifold\nof bounded geometry carries a periodic solution of motion with rescribed\nenergy, provided the potential satisfies an asymptotic growth condition,\nchanges sign, and the negative set of the potential is non-trivial in the\nrelative homology.\n", "  We elucidate the role of magnon interaction and spontaneous decays in the\nspin dynamics of the triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet by\ncalculating its dynamical structure factor within the spin-wave theory.\nExplicit theoretical results for neutron-scattering intensity are provided for\nspins S=1/2 and S=3/2. The dynamical structure factor exhibits unconventional\nfeatures such as quasiparticle peaks broadened by decays, non-Lorentzian\nlineshapes, and significant spectral weight redistribution to the two-magnon\ncontinuum. This rich excitation spectrum illustrates the complexity of the\ntriangular-lattice antiferromagnet and provides distinctive qualitative and\nquantitative fingerprints for experimental observation of decay-induced magnon\ndynamics.\n", "  We explicitly construct random hash functions for privacy amplification\n(extractors) that require smaller random seed lengths than the previous\nliterature, and still allow efficient implementations with complexity $O(n\\log\nn)$ for input length $n$. The key idea is the concept of dual universal$_2$\nhash function introduced recently. We also use a new method for constructing\nextractors by concatenating $\\delta$-almost dual universal$_2$ hash functions\nwith other extractors. Besides minimizing seed lengths, we also introduce\nmethods that allow one to use non-uniform random seeds for extractors. These\nmethods can be applied to a wide class of extractors, including dual\nuniversal$_2$ hash function, as well as to conventional universal$_2$ hash\nfunctions.\n", "  We synthesized large superconducting single crystal Ca0.77La0.18Fe0.90As2\n('112' type) of 2 millimeter size. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)\nmeasurements revealed that bright and dark stripes alternately spread on the\nsurface of crystals, indicating possible existence of intrinsic phase\nseparation. Temperature (T) -dependent resistivity, Hall effect and\nmagneto-resistance (MR) were measured with magnetic field (H) applied to\ndifferent directions of crystal. The upper critical field (Hc2) anisotropy was\nestimated with a moderate value around 2.8. Positive Hall coefficient (RH) and\nanisotropic MR were found and showed strong T-dependent feature. Below T about\n100 K, abnormal behaviors appear simultaneously in resistivity derivative, Hall\ncoefficient and MR, which indicates that other scattering mechanisms more than\nconventional multiband effect may exist.\n", "  Our single-crystal polarized neutron scattering at 65 mK and powder\nunpolarized neutron diffraction at 0.5 K show no evidence for a long-range\nmagnetic order and even detect no sign of diffuse magnetic neutron scattering\nin single-crystal SrTm2O4. The data refinements reveal that the two TmO6\noctahedral distortion modes are the same as those of the TbO6 octahedra in\nSrTb2O4, i.e., one distortion is stronger than the other one especially at low\ntemperatures, which is attributed probably to different crystal electric fields\nfor the two inequivalent octahedra. Consequently, we conclude that SrTm2O4 has\nno magnetic order, neither long-ranged nor short-ranged, even down to 65 mK.\nTherefore, SrTm2O4 is a different compound from its brethren in the new family\nof frustrated SrRE2O4 (RE = Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, and Yb) magnets. We propose\nthat crystal field anisotropy may dominate over weak dipolar spin interactions\nin SrTm2O4, leading to a virtually nonmagnetic ordering state.\n", "  We propose a formalism to derive the maximal bound of generalized Bell type\ninequalities and shows that the formalism can be applied to various form of\nBell functions. The generic Bell function is defined to generate the\ncombinations of all the possible correlations whose local realistic bound can\nbe obtained from the series of the constraint equations. The application of the\nconstraints converts the optimization problem into the counting problems whose\ncomplexity is dramatically reduced. It is also shown that generic Bell function\ncan be used to generate many other known Bell type functions such as Mermin,\nArdehali, Svetlichny functions for multipartite two-dimensional class.\n", "  A toy-model with $SU(2)_{\\rm TC}$ dynamics confined at high scales\n$\\Lambda_{\\rm TC}\\gg 100$ GeV enables to construct Dirac UV completion from the\noriginal chiral multiplets predicting a vector-like nature of their weak\ninteractions consistent with electroweak precision tests. In this work, we\ninvestigate a potential of the lightest scalar baryon-like (T-baryon) state\n$B^0=UD$ with mass $m_B\\gtrsim 1$ TeV predicted by the simplest two-flavor\nvector-like confinement model as a Dark Matter (DM) candidate. We show that two\ndifferent scenarios with the T-baryon relic abundance formation before and\nafter the electroweak (EW) phase transition epoch lead to symmetric (or mixed)\nand asymmetric DM, respectively. Such a DM candidate evades existing direct DM\ndetection constraints since its vector coupling to $Z$ boson absents at tree\nlevel, while one-loop gauge boson mediated contribution is shown to be\nvanishingly small close to the threshold. The dominating spin-independent (SI)\nT-baryon--nucleon scattering goes via tree-level Higgs boson exchange in the\n$t$-channel. The corresponding bound on the effective T-baryon--Higgs coupling\nhas been extracted from the recent LUX data and turns out to be consistent with\nnaive expectations from the light technipion case $m_{\\tilde \\pi}\\ll\n\\Lambda_{\\rm TC}$. The latter provides the most stringent phenomenological\nconstraint on strongly-coupled $SU(2)_{\\rm TC}$ dynamics so far. Future\nprospects for direct and indirect scalar T-baryon DM searches in astrophysics\nas well as in collider measurements have been discussed.\n", "  We apply the interacting parametrized post-Friedmann (IPPF) method to a\ncoupled dark energy model where the interaction is proportional to dark matter\ndensity at background level. In doing so, we perform a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo\nanalysis which combines several cosmological probes including the cosmic\nmicrowave background (WMAP9+Planck) data, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)\nmeasurements, JLA sample of supernovae, Hubble constant (HST), and\nredshift-space distortion (RSD) measurements through the ${\\rm f}\\sigma_{8}{\\rm\n(z)}$ data points. The joint observational analysis of ${\\rm\nPlanck+WP+JLA+BAO+HST+RSD}$ data leads to a coupling parameter,\n$\\xi_{c}=0.00140_{-0.00080}^{+0.00079}$ at $1\\sigma$ level for vanishing\nmomentum transfer potential; this value is reduced a when the momentum transfer\npotential is switched on, giving $\\xi_{c}=0.00136_{-0.00073}^{+0.00080}$ at\n$1\\sigma$ level. The CMB power spectrum shows up a correlation between the\ncoupling parameter $\\xi_{c}$ and the position of acoustic peaks or their\namplitudes. The first peak's height increases when $\\xi_{c}$ takes larger\nvalues and its position is shifted. We also obtain the matter power spectrum\nmay be affected by the strength of interaction coupling over scales bigger that\n$10^{-2} {\\rm h~ Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing its amplitude in relation to the vanilla\nmodel.\n", "  By applying dynamical mean-field theory in combination with exact\ndiagonalization at zero temperature to a half-filled Hubbard model with two\norbitals having distinct noninteracting densities of states, we show that an\norbital selective Mott transition (OSMT) will take place even without crystal\nfield splitting, differences in bandwidth and orbital degeneracy. We find that\nformation of local spin triplet states followed by a two-stage breakdown of the\nKondo effect, rather than decoupling of charge degrees of freedom among\ndifferent orbitals, is the underlying physics for the OSMT. The relevance of\nour findings to Ca$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$RuO$_4$ and the iron-based superconductors is\ndiscussed, and a decent candidate to detect such an origin for the OSMT is\nproposed.\n", "  In his 2007 monograph, D. Christodoulou proved a remarkable result giving a\ndetailed description of shock formation, for small $H^s$-initial conditions\n($s$ sufficiently large), in solutions to the relativistic Euler equations in\nthree space dimensions. His work provided a significant advancement over a\nlarge body of prior work concerning the long-time behavior of solutions to\nhigher-dimensional quasilinear wave equations, initiated by F. John in the mid\n1970's and continued by S. Klainerman, T. Sideris, L. H\\\"ormander, H. Lindblad,\nS. Alinhac, and others. Our goal in this paper is to give an overview of his\nresult, outline its main new ideas, and place it in the context of the above\nmentioned earlier work. We also introduce the recent work of J. Speck, which\nextends Christodoulou's result to show that for two important classes of\nquasilinear wave equations in three space dimensions, small-data shock\nformation occurs precisely when the quadratic nonlinear terms fail the classic\nnull condition.\n", "  The basic reproduction number R0 -- the number of individuals directly\ninfected by an infectious person in an otherwise susceptible population -- is\narguably the most widely used estimator of how severe an epidemic outbreak can\nbe. This severity can be more directly measured as the fraction people infected\nonce the outbreak is over, {\\Omega}. In traditional mathematical epidemiology\nand common formulations of static network epidemiology, there is a\ndeterministic relationship between R0 and {\\Omega}. However, if one considers\ndisease spreading on a temporal contact network -- where one knows when\ncontacts happen, not only between whom -- then larger R0 does not necessarily\nimply larger {\\Omega}. In this paper, we numerically investigate the\nrelationship between R0 and {\\Omega} for a set of empirical temporal networks\nof human contacts. Among 31 explanatory descriptors of temporal network\nstructure, we identify those that make R0 an imperfect predictor of {\\Omega}.\nWe find that descriptors related to both temporal and topological aspects\naffect the relationship between R0 and {\\Omega}, but in different ways.\n", "  Despite extensive work on high-temperature superconductors, the critical\nbehavior of an incipient condensate has so far been studied exclusively under\nequilibrium conditions. Here, we excite Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d with a femtosecond\nlaser pulse and monitor the subsequent nonequilibrium dynamics of the\nmid-infrared conductivity. Our data allow us to discriminate temperature\nregimes where superconductivity is either coherent, fluctuating or vanishingly\nsmall. Above the transition temperature Tc, we make the striking observation\nthat the relaxation to equilibrium exhibits power-law dynamics and scaling\nbehavior, both for optimally and underdoped superconductors. Our findings can\nin part be modeled using time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory and provide\nstrong indication of universality in systems far from equilibrium.\n", "  We address the question of the locality versus nonlocality in the\nAharonov-Bohm and the Aharonov-Casher effects. For this purpose, we investigate\nall possible configurations of ideal shielding of the overlap between the\nelectromagnetic fields generated by a charge and by a magnetic flux, and\nanalyze their consequences on the Aharonov-Bohm-Casher interference. In a\nclassical treatment of shielding, the Aharonov-Bohm-Casher effect vanishes\nregardless of the geometry of shielding, when the local overlap of\nelectromagnetic fields is completely eliminated. On the other hand, the result\ndepends on the configuration of shielding if the charge quantization in the\nsuperconducting shield is taken into account. It is shown that our results are\nfully understood in terms of the fluctuating local-field interaction. Our\nanalysis strongly supports the alternative view on the Aharonov-Bohm-Casher\ninterference that the effects originate from the local action of\nelectromagnetic fields.\n", "  It is known that the stationary distribution of the random walk process is\ndependent on the structure of the network. This could provide us a solution of\nthe network reconstruction. However, the stationary distribution of the random\nwalk process can only reflect the relative size of node degrees directly, how\nto infer the real connection is still a problem. In this paper, we will propose\na method to reconstruct network by the random walk process, which can\nreconstruct the total number of links, degree sequence and links sequentially.\nIn our method, only the stationary distribution is used, and no data of the\nevolution process is needed, such as the first passage time. We perform our\nmethod on some network models and real-world network, the results indicate our\nmethod can reconstruct networks accurately, even when we can not get the exact\nstationary distribution.\n", "  We measure the proper motion of the pulsar PSR J1745-2900 relative to the\nGalactic Center massive black hole, Sgr A*, using the Very Long Baseline Array\n(VLBA). The pulsar has a transverse velocity of 236 +/- 11 km s^-1 at position\nangle 22 +/- 2 deg East of North at a projected separation of 0.097 pc from Sgr\nA*. Given the unknown radial velocity, this transverse velocity measurement\ndoes not conclusively prove that the pulsar is bound to Sgr A*; however, the\nprobability of chance alignment is very small. We do show that the velocity and\nposition is consistent with a bound orbit originating in the clockwise disk of\nmassive stars orbiting Sgr A* and a natal velocity kick of <~ 500 km s^-1. An\norigin among the isotropic stellar cluster is possible but less probable. If\nthe pulsar remains radio-bright, multi-year astrometry of PSR J1745-2900 can\ndetect its acceleration and determine the full three-dimensional orbit. We also\ndemonstrate that PSR J1745-2900 exhibits the same angular broadening as Sgr A*\nover a wavelength range of 3.6 cm to 0.7 cm, further confirming that the two\nsources share the same interstellar scattering properties. Finally, we place\nthe first limits on the presence of a wavelength-dependent shift in the\nposition of Sgr A*, i.e., the core shift, one of the expected properties of\noptically-thick jet emission. Our results for PSR J1745-2900 support the\nhypothesis that Galactic Center pulsars will originate from the stellar disk\nand deepens the mystery regarding the small number of detected Galactic Center\npulsars.\n", "  The electromagnetic properties of neutrinos, which are either trivial or\nnegligible in the context of the Standard Model, can probe new physics and have\nsignificant implications in astrophysics and cosmology. The current best direct\nlimits on the neutrino millicharges and magnetic moments are both derived from\ndata taken with germanium detectors with low thresholds at keV levels. In this\npaper, we discuss in detail a robust, ab initio method: the multiconfiguration\nrelativistic random phase approximation, that enables us to reliably understand\nthe germanium detector response at the sub-keV level, where atomic many-body\nphysics matters. Using existing data with sub-keV thresholds, limits on reactor\nantineutrino's millicharge, magnetic moment, and charge radius squared are\nderived. The projected sensitivities for next generation experiments are also\ngiven and discussed.\n", "  Using first-principles density functional theory calculations, we investigate\nthe geometries, electronic structures, and thermodynamic stabilities of\nsubstitutionally doped phosphorene sheets with group III, IV, V, and VI\nelements. We find that the electronic properties of phosphorene are drastically\nmodified by the number of valence electrons in dopant atoms. The dopants with\neven number of valence electrons enable the doped phosphorenes to have a\nmetallic feature, while the dopants with odd number of valence electrons keep\nthe semiconducting feature with a larger band gap than the undoped phosphorene.\nThis even-odd behavior is attributed to the peculiar bonding characteristics of\nphosphorene and the strong hybridization of sp orbitals between dopants and\nphosphorene. The calculated formation energies of various substitutional\ndopants in phosphorene show that such doped systems can be thermodynamically\nstable.\n", "  We derive the joint distribution of the moments $\\mathrm{Tr}\\, Q^{\\kappa}$\n($\\kappa\\geq0$) of the Wigner-Smith matrix for a chaotic cavity supporting a\nlarge number of scattering channels $n$. This distribution turns out to be\nasymptotically Gaussian, and we compute explicitly averages and covariances.\nThe results are in a compact form and have been verified numerically. The\ngeneral methodology of proof and computations has a wide range of applications.\n", "  Quantum key distribution (QKD) gaurantees unconditional communication\nsecurity based on the laws of quantum physics. However, practical QKD suffers\nfrom a number of quantum hackings due to the device imperfections. From the\nsecurity standpoint, measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution\n(MDI-QKD) is in the limelight since it eliminates all the possible loopholes in\ndetection. Due to active control units for mode matching between the photons\nfrom remote parties, however, the implementation of MDI-QKD is highly\nimpractical. In this article, we propose a novel method in which the\nindistinguishability issue is resolved without any active control unit. By\nintroducing Plug-and-Play (P&P) concept into MDI-QKD, the indistinguishability\nbetween photons can naturally be guaranteed. We show the feasibility of P&P\nMDI-QKD with a proof-of-principle experiment.\n", "  Considering the propagation of fields in the spacetime continuum and the\nwell-defined features of fields with finite degrees of freedom, the wave\nfunction is expanded in terms of a finite set of basis functions localized in\nspacetime. This paper presents the analytic eigenenergies derived for a\nconfined fundamental fermion-antifermion pair under a linear potential obtained\nfrom the Wilson loop for the non-Abelian Yang-Mills field. The Hamiltonian\nmatrix of the Dirac equation is analytically diagonalized using basis functions\nlocalized in spacetime. The squared lowest eigenenergy (as a function of the\nrelativistic quantum number when the rotational energy is large compared to the\ncomposite particle masses) is proportional to the string tension and the\nabsolute value of the Dirac's relativistic quantum number related to the total\nangular momentum, consistent with the expectation.\n", "  The second-order temporal interference between two independent single-mode\ncontinuous-wave lasers is discussed by employing two-photon interference in\nFeynman's path integral theory. It is concluded that whether the second-order\ntemporal interference pattern can be retrieved via two-photon coincidence\ncounting measurement is dependent on the relationship between the resolution\ntime of the detection system and the frequency difference between these two\nlasers. Two identical and tunable single-mode diode lasers are employed to\nverify the predictions experimentally. The experimental results are consistent\nwith the theoretical predictions. These studies are helpful to understand the\nphysics of two-photon interference with photons of different spectrums and\napplication of two-photon interference in quantum information processing.\n", "  In this paper, we generalize a previous relativistic $1+1$-dimensional model\nfor two mass-less Dirac particles with relativistic contact interactions to the\n$N$-particle case. Our model is based on the notion of a multi-time wave\nfunction which, according to Dirac, is the central object in a relativistic\nmulti-particle quantum theory in the Schr\\\"odinger picture. Consequently, we\nachieve a manifestly Lorentz invariant formulation on configuration space-time.\nOur model is constructed to be compatible with antisymmetry and probability\nconservation in a relativistic sense. On the mathematical side, we further\ndevelop the method of multi-time characteristics and show that uniqueness of\nsolutions follows from probability conservation. We prove that the model is\ninteracting and outline how one can understand the interaction as effectively\ngiven by a $\\delta$-potential at equal times. Finally, we answer the question\nwhether Lorentz invariant and probability-conserving dynamics can also be\nobtained when the particles are confined in a region with a non-zero minimal\nspace-like distance, a question relevant for an extension to higher dimensions.\n", "  Recently, Li and Nie (Int. J. Theo. Phys. 52:1630, 2013) had introduced a\nbidirectional controlled quantum teleportation (BCQT) protocol by using\nGHZ-Bell state as a quantum channel. Also, Shukla et al. (Int. J. Theo. Phys.\n52:3790, 2013) had shown the Li and Nie (LN) protocol is not a BCQT scheme. In\nthis paper, two kinds of bidirectional teleportation schemes in order to\ncorrect and improve LN protocol are presented. In the first scheme, Alice and\nBob as two legitimate users can simultaneously teleport an unknown single-qubit\nstate to each other with the help of controller Charlie. In the second scheme,\nAlice can transmit two-qubit entangled state to Bob and at the same time Bob\ncan teleport single-qubit state to Alice. In both of proposed schemes the\nquantum channel linking users is a GHZ-Bell state.\n", "  We study the quantum entropy of systems that are described by general\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonians, including those which can model the effects of\nsinks or sources. We generalize the von Neumann entropy to the non- Hermitian\ncase and find that one needs both the normalized and non-normalized density\noperators in order to properly describe irreversible processes. It turns out\nthat such a generalization monitors the onset of disorder in quantum\ndissipative systems. We give arguments for why one can consider the generalized\nentropy as the informational entropy describing the flow of information between\nthe system and the bath. We illustrate the theory by explicitly studying few\nsimple models, including tunneling systems with two energy levels and\nnon-Hermitian detuning.\n", "  Charged jet production cross sections in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm\nNN}} = 5.02$ TeV measured with the ALICE detector at the LHC are presented.\nUsing the anti-$k_{\\rm T}$ algorithm, jets have been reconstructed in the\ncentral rapidity region from charged particles with resolution parameters $R =\n0.2$ and $R = 0.4$. The reconstructed jets have been corrected for detector\neffects and the underlying event background. To calculate the nuclear\nmodification factor, $R_{\\rm pPb}$, of charged jets in p-Pb collisions, a pp\nreference was constructed by scaling previously measured charged jet spectra at\n$\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV. In the transverse momentum range $20 \\le p_{\\rm T,ch\\ jet}\n\\le 120$ GeV/$c$, $R_{\\rm pPb}$ is found to be consistent with unity,\nindicating the absence of strong nuclear matter effects on jet production.\nMajor modifications to the radial jet structure are probed via the ratio of jet\nproduction cross sections reconstructed with the two different resolution\nparameters. This ratio is found to be similar to the measurement in pp\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV and to the expectations from PYTHIA pp\nsimulations and NLO pQCD calculations at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV.\n", "  The analysis of the electronic properties of strained or lattice deformed\ngraphene combines ideas from classical condensed matter physics, soft matter,\nand geometrical aspects of quantum field theory (QFT) in curved spaces. Recent\ntheoretical and experimental work shows the influence of strains in many\nproperties of graphene not considered before, such as electronic transport,\nspin-orbit coupling, the formation of Moir\\'e patterns, optics, ... There is\nalso significant evidence of anharmonic effects, which can modify the\nstructural properties of graphene. These phenomena are not restricted to\ngraphene, and they are being intensively studied in other two dimensional\nmaterials, such as the metallic dichalcogenides. We review here recent\ndevelopments related to the role of strains in the structural and electronic\nproperties of graphene and other two dimensional compounds.\n", "  We study synchronization phenomenon in a self-correcting population of noisy\nphase oscillators with randomly distributed natural frequencies. In our model\neach oscillator stochastically switches its phase to the ensemble-averaged\nvalue $\\psi$ at a typical rate which is proportional to the degree of phase\ncoherence $r$. The system exhibits a continuous phase transition to collective\nsynchronization similar to classical Kuramoto model. Based on the\nself-consistent arguments and on the linear stability analysis of an incoherent\nstate we derive analytically the threshold value $k_c$ of coupling constant\ncorresponding to the onset of a partially synchronized state. Just above the\ntransition point the linear scaling law $r\\propto k-k_c$ is found. We also show\nthat nonlinear relation between rate of phase correction and order parameter\nleads to non-trivial transition between incoherence and synchrony. To\nillustrate our analytical results, numerical simulations have been performed\nfor a large population of phase oscillators with proposed type of coupling. The\nresults of this work could become useful in designing distributed networked\nsystems capable of self-synchronization.\n", "  We analyse the structure of Yukawa couplings in local SU(5) F-theory models\nwith $E_8$ enhancement. In this setting the $E_8$ symmetry is broken down to\nSU(5) by a 7-brane configuration described by T-branes, all the Yukawa\ncouplings are generated in the vicinity of a point and only one family of\nquarks and leptons is massive at tree-level. The other two families obtain\ntheir masses when non-perturbative effects are taken into account, being\nhierarchically lighter than the third family. However, and contrary to previous\nresults, we find that this hierarchy of fermion masses is not always\nappropriate to reproduce measured data. We find instead that different T-brane\nconfigurations breaking $E_8$ to SU(5) give rise to distinct hierarchical\npatterns for the holomorphic Yukawa couplings. Only some of these patterns\nallow to fit the observed fermion masses with reasonable local model parameter\nvalues, adding further constraints to the construction of F-theory GUTs. We\nconsider an $E_8$ model where such appropriate hierarchy is realised and\ncompute its physical Yukawas, showing that realistic charged fermions masses\ncan indeed be obtained in this case.\n", "  It was recently suggested that the sign of particle drift in inhomogeneous\ntemperature or turbulence depends on the particle inertia: weakly inertial\nparticles localize near minima of temperature or turbulence intensity (effects\nknown as thermophoresis and turbophoresis), while strongly inertial particles\nfly away from minima in an unbounded space. The problem of a particle near\nminima of turbulence intensity is related to that of two particles in a random\nflow, so that the localization-delocalization transition in the former\ncorresponds to the path-coalescence transition in the latter. The transition is\nsignaled by the sign change of the Lyapunov exponent that characterizes the\nmean rate of particle approach to the minimum (which could be wall or another\nparticle). Here we solve analytically this problem for inelastic collisions and\nderive the phase diagram for the transition in the inertia-inelasticity plane.\nAn important feature of the phase diagram is the region of inelastic collapse:\nif the restitution coefficient of particle velocity is smaller than some\ncritical value, then the particle is localized for any inertia. We present\ndirect numerical simulations which support the theory and in addition reveal\nthe dependence of the transition of the flow correlation time, characterized by\nthe Stokes number.\n", "  We have studied the transverse-momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) dependence of the\ninclusive J/$\\psi$ production in p-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}} = 5.02$\nTeV, in three center-of-mass rapidity ($y_{\\rm cms}$) regions, down to zero\n$p_{\\rm T}$. Results in the forward and backward rapidity ranges ($2.03 <\ny_{\\rm cms} < 3.53$ and $-4.46 <y_{\\rm cms}< -2.96$) are obtained by studying\nthe J/$\\psi$ decay to $\\mu^+\\mu^-$, while the mid-rapidity region ($-1.37 <\ny_{\\rm cms} < 0.43$) is investigated by measuring the ${\\rm e}^+{\\rm e}^-$\ndecay channel. The $p_{\\rm T}$ dependence of the J/$\\psi$ production cross\nsection and nuclear modification factor are presented for each of the rapidity\nintervals, as well as the J/$\\psi$ mean $p_{\\rm T}$ values. Forward and\nmid-rapidity results show a suppression of the J/$\\psi$ yield, with respect to\npp collisions, which decreases with increasing $p_{\\rm T}$. At backward\nrapidity no significant J/$\\psi$ suppression is observed. Theoretical models\nincluding a combination of cold nuclear matter effects such as shadowing and\npartonic energy loss, are in fair agreement with the data, except at forward\nrapidity and low transverse momentum. The implications of the p-Pb results for\nthe evaluation of cold nuclear matter effects on J/$\\psi$ production in Pb-Pb\ncollisions are also discussed.\n", "  In this work we find the general static vacuum solution of three dimensional\ngravity with negative cosmological constant. Even though all solutions are\nlocally diffeomorphic to pure $AdS_{3}$, solutions that differ globally from\nthe latter space exist. New solutions with black holes on the $AdS_3$ boundary\nare found in both global and Poincare coordinates. In the Poincare coordinates\nsuch solutions are known as black funnels and black droplets. The black funnel\nprovided by our general static metric is dual to the Hartle-Hawking state in\nthe $1+1$ boundary theory.\n", "  We report the first measurement at the LHC of coherent photoproduction of\n$\\rho^0$ mesons in ultra-peripheral Pb-Pb collisions. The invariant mass and\ntransverse momentum distributions for $\\rho^0$ production are studied in the\n$\\pi^+ \\pi^-$ decay channel at mid-rapidity. The production cross section in\nthe rapidity range $|y|<0.5$ is found to be $\\mathrm{d}\\sigma/\\mathrm{d}y = 425\n\\pm 10 \\, (\\mathrm{stat.})$ $^{+42}_{-50} \\, (\\mathrm{sys.})$ mb. Coherent\n$\\rho^0$ production is studied with and without requirement of nuclear breakup,\nand the fractional yields for various breakup scenarios are presented. The\nresults are compared with those from lower energies and with model predictions.\n", "  We show that the interaction of a pulsed laser light with a mechanical\noscillator through the radiation pressure results in an opto-mechanical\nentangled state in which the photon number is correlated with the oscillator\nposition. Interestingly, the mechanical oscillator can be delocalized over a\nlarge range of positions when driven by an intense laser light. This provides a\nsimple yet sensitive method to probe hypothetic post-quantum theories including\nan explicit wave function collapse model, like the Diosi and Penrose model. We\npropose an entanglement witness to reveal the quantum nature of this\nopto-mechanical state as well as an optical technique to record the decoherence\nof the mechanical oscillator. We also report on a detailed feasibility study\ngiving the experimental challenges that need to be overcome to confirm or rule\nout predictions from explicit wave function collapse models.\n", "  We present first-principles density-functional calculations for the\nstructural, electronic, and magnetic properties of substitutional 3d transition\nmetal (TM) impurities in two-dimensional black and blue phosphorenes. We find\nthat the magnetic properties of such substitutional impurities can be\nunderstood in terms of a simple model based on the Hund's rule. The TM-doped\nblack phosphorenes with Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe and Ni impurities show dilute\nmagnetic semiconductor (DMS) properties while those with Sc and Co impurities\nshow nonmagnetic properties. On the other hand, the TM-doped blue phosphorenes\nwith V, Cr, Mn and Fe impurities show DMS properties, those with Ti and Ni\nimpurities show half-metal properties, whereas Sc and Co doped systems show\nnonmagnetic properties. We identify two different regimes depending on the\noccupation of the hybridized electronic states of TM and phosphorous atoms: (i)\nbonding states are completely empty or filled for Sc- and Co-doped black and\nblue phosphorenes, leading to non-magnetic; (ii) non-bonding d states are\npartially occupied for Ti-, V-, Cr-, Mn-, Fe- and Ni-doped black and blue\nphosphorenes, giving rise to large and localized spin moments. These results\nprovide a new route for the potential applications of dilute magnetic\nsemiconductor and half-metal in spintronic devices by employing black and blue\nphosphorenes.\n", "  I discuss an upper bound on the boost and the energy of elementary particles.\nThe limit is derived utilizing the core principle of relativistic quantum\nmechanics stating that there is a lower bound for localization of an elementary\nquantum system and the assumption that when the localization scale reaches the\nPlanck length, elementary particles are removed from the S-matrix observables.\nThe limits for the boost and energy, M_{Planck}/m and\nM_{Planck}c^{2}\\approx\\,8.6 * 10^{27} eV, are defined in terms of fundamental\nconstants and the mass of elementary particle and does not involve any dynamic\nscale. These bounds imply that the cosmic ray flux of any flavor may stretch up\nto energies of order 10^{18} GeV and will cut off around this value.\n", "  We study asymptotics of the free energy for the directed polymer in random\nenvironment. The polymer is allowed to make unbounded jumps and the environment\nis given by Bernoulli variables. We first establish the existence and\ncontinuity of the free energy including the negative infinity value of the\ncoupling constant $\\beta$. Our proof of existence at $\\beta=-\\infty$ differs\nfrom existing ones in that it avoids the direct use of subadditivity. Secondly,\nwe identify the asymptotics of the free energy at $\\beta=-\\infty$ in the limit\nof the success probability of the Bernoulli variables tending to one. It is\ndescribed by using the so-called time constant of a certain directed first\npassage percolation. Our proof relies on a certain continuity property of the\ntime constant, which is of independent interest.\n", "  We study the symplectic reduction of the phase space describing $k$ particles\nin $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with total angular momentum zero. This corresponds to the\nsingular symplectic quotient associated to the diagonal action of\n$\\operatorname{O}_n$ on $k$ copies of $\\mathbb{C}^n$ at the zero value of the\nhomogeneous quadratic moment map. We give a description of the ideal of\nrelations of the ring of regular functions of the symplectic quotient. Using\nthis description, we demonstrate $\\mathbb{Z}^+$-graded regular\nsymplectomorphisms among the $\\operatorname{O}_n$- and\n$\\operatorname{SO}_n$-symplectic quotients and determine which of these\nquotients are graded regularly symplectomorphic to linear symplectic orbifolds.\nWe demonstrate that when $n \\leq k$, the zero fibre of the moment map has\nrational singularities and hence is normal and Cohen-Macaulay. We also\ndemonstrate that for small values of $k$, the ring of regular functions on the\nsymplectic quotient is graded Gorenstein.\n", "  Integrating epitaxial and ferromagnetic Europium Oxide (EuO) directly on\nsilicon is a perfect route to enrich silicon nanotechnology with spin filter\nfunctionality.\n  To date, the inherent chemical reactivity between EuO and Si has prevented a\nheteroepitaxial integration without significant contaminations of the interface\nwith Eu silicides and Si oxides.\n  We present a solution to this long-standing problem by applying two\ncomplementary passivation techniques for the reactive EuO/Si interface:\n  ($i$) an $in\\:situ$ hydrogen-Si $(001)$ passivation and ($ii$) the\napplication of oxygen-protective Eu monolayers --- without using any additional\nbuffer layers.\n  By careful chemical depth profiling of the oxide-semiconductor interface via\nhard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, we show how to systematically minimize\nboth Eu silicide and Si oxide formation to the sub-monolayer regime --- and how\nto ultimately interface-engineer chemically clean, heteroepitaxial and\nferromagnetic EuO/Si $(001)$ in order to create a strong spin filter contact to\nsilicon.\n", "  We introduce a topological quantum number -- coined dynamical topological\norder parameter (DTOP) -- that is dynamically defined in the real-time\nevolution of a quantum many-body system and represented by a momentum space\nwinding number of the Pancharatnam geometric phase. Our construction goes\nconceptually beyond the standard notion of topological invariants\ncharacterizing the wave-function of a system, which are constants of motion\nunder coherent time evolution. In particular, we show that the DTOP can change\nits integer value at discrete times where so called dynamical quantum phase\ntransitions occur, thus serving as a dynamical analog of an order parameter.\nInterestingly, studying quantum quenches in one-dimensional two-banded\nBogoliubov de Gennes models, we find that the DTOP is capable of resolving if\nthe topology of the system Hamiltonian has changed over the quench.\nFurthermore, we investigate the relation of the DTOP to the dynamics of the\nstring order parameter that characterizes the topology of such systems in\nthermal equilibrium.\n", "  We give an explicit entropy production formula for a class of quantum Markov\nsemigroups, arising in the weak coupling limit of a system coupled with\nreservoirs, whose generators $\\mathcal{L}$ are sums of other generators\n$\\mathcal{L}_\\omega$ associated with positive Bohr frequencies $\\omega$ of the\nsystem. As a consequence, we show that any such semigroup satisfies the quantum\ndetailed balance condition with respect to an invariant state if and only if\nall semigroups generated by each $\\mathcal{L}_\\omega$ so do with respect to the\nsame invariant state.\n", "  The Schr\\\"odinger-Langevin (SL) equation is considered as an effective open\nquantum system formalism suitable for phenomenological applications involving a\nquantum subsystem interacting with a thermal bath. We focus on two open issues\nrelative to its solutions: the stationarity of the excited states of the\nnon-interacting subsystem when one considers the dissipation only and the\nthermal relaxation toward asymptotic distributions with the additional\nstochastic term. We first show that a proper application of the Madelung/polar\ntransformation of the wave function leads to a non zero damping of the excited\nstates of the quantum subsystem. We then study analytically and numerically the\nSL equation ability to bring a quantum subsystem to the thermal equilibrium of\nstatistical mechanics. To do so, concepts about statistical mixed states and\nquantum noises are discussed and a detailed analysis is carried with two kinds\nof noise and potential. We show that within our assumptions the use of the SL\nequation as an effective open quantum system formalism is possible and discuss\nsome of its limitations.\n", "  As a new type of topological materials, ZrTe5 shows many exotic properties\nunder extreme conditions. Utilizing resistance and ac magnetic susceptibility\nmeasurements under high pressure, while the resistance anomaly near 128 K is\ncompletely suppressed at 6.2 GPa, a fully superconducting transition emerges\nsurprisingly. The superconducting transition temperature Tc increases with\napplied pressure, and reaches a maximum of 4.0 K at 14.6 GPa, followed by a\nslight drop but remaining almost constant value up to 68.5 GPa. At pressures\nabove 21.2 GPa, a second superconducting phase with the maximum Tc of about 6.0\nK appears and coexists with the original one to the maximum pressure studied in\nthis work. In situ high-pressure synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Raman\nspectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations indicate the observed\ntwo-stage superconducting behavior is correlated to the structural phase\ntransition from ambient Cmcm phase to high-pressure C2/m phase around 6 GPa,\nand to a mixture of two high-pressure phases of C2/m and P-1 above 20 GPa. The\ncombination of structure, transport measurement and theoretical calculations\nenable a complete understanding of the emerging exotic properties in\nthree-dimensional topological materials happened under extreme environments.\n", "  The development of advanced quantum technologies and the quest for a deeper\nunderstanding of many-particle quantum mechanics requires control over the\nquantum state of interacting particles to a high degree of fidelity. However,\nthe quickly increasing density of the spectrum, together with the appearance of\ncrossings in time-dependent processes, makes any effort to control the system\nhard and resource intensive. Here we show that in trapped systems regimes can\nexist, in which isolated energy bands appear that allow to easily generalize\nknown single-particle techniques. We demonstrate this for the well-known\nspatial adiabatic passage effect, which can control the center-of-mass state of\natoms with high fidelity.\n", "  We determine conditions on the filling of electrons in a crystalline lattice\nto obtain the equivalent of a band insulator -- a gapped insulator with neither\nsymmetry breaking nor fractionalized excitations. We allow for strong\ninteractions, which precludes a free particle description. Previous approaches\nthat extend the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis argument invoked spin conservation in an\nessential way, and cannot be applied to the physically interesting case of\nspin-orbit coupled systems. Here we introduce two approaches, the first an\nentanglement based scheme, while the second studies the system on an\nappropriate flat `Bieberbach' manifold to obtain the filling conditions for all\n230 space groups. These approaches only assume time reversal rather than spin\nrotation invariance. The results depend crucially on whether the crystal\nsymmetry is symmorphic. Our results clarify when one may infer the existence of\nan exotic ground state based on the absence of order, and we point out\napplications to experimentally realized materials. Extensions to new situations\ninvolving purely spin models are also mentioned.\n", "  In the case of graph partitioning, the emergence of localized eigenvectors\ncan cause the standard spectral method to fail. To overcome this problem, the\nspectral method using a non-backtracking matrix was proposed. Based on\nnumerical experiments on several examples of real networks, it is clear that\nthe non-backtracking matrix does not exhibit localization of eigenvectors.\nHowever, we show that localized eigenvectors of the non-backtracking matrix can\nexist outside the spectral band, which may lead to deterioration in the\nperformance of graph partitioning.\n", "  We perform time resolved photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of optimally\ndoped $\\tn{Bi}_2\\tn{Sr}_2\\tn{CaCu}_2\\tn{O}_{8+\\delta}$ (Bi-2212) and\n$\\tn{Bi}_2\\tn{Sr}_{2-x}\\tn{La}_{x}\\tn{Cu}\\tn{O}_{6+\\delta}$ (Bi-2201). The\nelectrons dynamics show that inelastic scattering by nodal quasiparticles\ndecreases when the temperature is lowered below the critical value of the\nsuperconducting phase transition. This drop of electronic dissipation is\nastonishingly robust and survives to photoexcitation densities much larger than\nthe value sustained by long-range superconductivity. The unconventional\nbehaviour of quasiparticle scattering is ascribed to superconducting\ncorrelations extending on a length scale comparable to the inelastic path. Our\nmeasurements indicate that strongly driven superconductors enter in a regime\nwithout phase coherence but finite pairing amplitude. The latter vanishes near\nto the critical temperature and has no evident link with the pseudogap observed\nby Angle Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy (ARPES).\n", "  The mass, energy and momentum of the neutrino of a true flavor have an\naxial-vector nature. As a consequence, the left-handed truly neutral neutrino\nin an axial-vector field of emission can be converted into a right-handed one\nand vice versa. This predicts the unidenticality of masses, energies and\nmomenta of neutrinos of the different components. Recognizing such a difference\nin masses, energies, momenta and accepting that the left-handed axial-vector\nneutrino and the right-handed antineutrino of true neutrality refer to\nlong-lived C-odd leptons, and the right-handed truly neutral neutrino and the\nleft-handed axial-vector antineutrino are of short-lived fermions of C-oddity,\nwe would write a new CP-even Dirac equation taking into account the flavor\nsymmetrical axial-vector mass, energy and momentum matrices. Their presence\nexplains the spontaneous mirror symmetry violation, confirming that an\naxial-vector current conservation law has never violated. They reflect the\navailability of a mirror Minkowski space in which a neutrino is characterized\nby left as well as by right space-time coordinates. Therefore, it is not\nsurprising that whatever the main purposes experiments about a quasielastic\naxial-vector mass say in favor of an axial-vector mirror Minkowski space-time.\n", "  Hadrons have finite interaction size with dense material, a basic feature\ncommon to known forms of hadronic calorimeters (HCAL). We argue that\nsubstructure variables cannot use HCAL information to access the microscopic\nnature of jets much narrower than the hadronic shower size, which we call\nsuperboosted massive jets. It implies that roughly 15% of their transverse\nenergy profile remains inaccessible due to the presence of long-lived neutral\nhadrons. This part of the jet substructure is also subject to order-one\nfluctuations. We demonstrate that the effects of the fluctuations are not\nreduced when a global correction to jet variables is applied. The above leads\nto fundamental limitations in the ability to extract intrinsic information from\njets in the superboosted regime. The neutral fraction of a jet is correlated\nwith its flavor. This leads to an interesting and possibly useful difference\nbetween superboosted W/Z/h/t jets and their corresponding backgrounds. The QCD\njets that form the background to the signal superboosted jets might also be\nqualitatively different in their substructure as their mass might lie at or\nbelow the Sudakov mass peak. Finally, we introduce a set of zero-cone\nlongitudinal jet substructure variables and show that while they carry\ninformation that might be useful in certain situations, they are not in general\nsensitive to the jet substructure.\n", "  We have generalised the concept of graph states to what we have called mixed\ngraph states, which we define in terms of mixed graphs, that is graphs with\nboth directed and undirected edges, as the density matrix stabilized by the\nassociated stabilizer matrix defined by the mixed graph. We can interpret this\nmatrix as a quantum object by making it part of a larger fully commuting\nmatrix, i.e. where we choose the environment appropriately, and this will imply\nthat our quantum object is a mixed state.\n  We prove that, in the same way as (pure) graph states, the density matrix of\na parent of mixed graph state can be written as sum of a few Pauli matrices,\nwell defined from the mixed graph. We have proven that the set of matrices that\nappear in this sum is fully pair-wise commuting, and form a multiplicative\ngroup up to global constants, which is always of maximum size. Furthermore, the\ncardinality of the set depends solely of the miminum possible number of\nextension columns/rows, and the number of nodes of the mixed graph. We prove a\nformula for this cardinality. Finally, in the case of purely undirected graphs,\nthis corresponds to the usual pure graph state.\n  Also, we have developed a way of finding maximal commutative group of such\nPauli matrices as a linear subspace problem, for any given mixed graph. We also\nhave proven how the structure of maximal commutative groups is independent of\nthe direction of the arrows of the mixed graph, and also of the undirected\nedges; this allows the simplification of the problem of finding these groups in\ngeneral to finding them for a much smaller set of graphs.\n", "  One of the key challenges in spectroscopy is inhomogeneous broadening that\nmasks the homogeneous spectral lineshape and the underlying coherent dynamics.\nA variety of techniques including four-wave mixing and spectral hole-burning\nare used in optical spectroscopy while in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)\nspin-echo is the most common way to counteract inhomogeneity. However, the\nhigh-power pulses used in spin-echo and other sequences often create spurious\ndynamics obscuring the subtle spin correlations that play a crucial role in\nquantum information applications. Here we develop NMR techniques that allow the\ncorrelation times of the fluctuations in a nuclear spin bath of individual\nquantum dots to be probed. This is achieved with the use of frequency comb\nexcitation which allows the homogeneous NMR lineshapes to be measured avoiding\nhigh-power pulses. We find nuclear spin correlation times exceeding 1 s in\nself-assembled InGaAs quantum dots - four orders of magnitude longer than in\nstrain-free III-V semiconductors. The observed freezing of the nuclear spin\nfluctuations opens the way for the design of quantum dot spin qubits with a\nwell-understood, highly stable nuclear spin bath.\n", "  Antiferromagnets (AFMs) exhibit intrinsic magnetization when the order\nparameter spatially varies. This intrinsic spin is present even at equilibrium\nand can be interpreted as a twisting of the homogeneous AFM into a state with a\nfinite spin. Because magnetic moments couple directly to external magnetic\nfields, the intrinsic magnetization can alter the dynamics of antiferromagnetic\ntextures under such influence. Starting from the discrete Heisenberg model, we\nderive the continuum limit of the free energy of AFMs in the exchange\napproximation and explicitly rederive that the spatial variation of the\nantiferromagnetic order parameter is associated with an intrinsic magnetization\ndensity. We calculate the magnetization profile of a domain wall and discuss\nhow the intrinsic magnetization reacts to external forces. We show\nconclusively, both analytically and numerically, that a spatially inhomogeneous\nmagnetic field can move and control the position of domain walls in AFMs. By\ncomparing our model to a commonly used alternative parametrization procedure\nfor the continuum fields, we show that the physical interpretations of these\nfields depend critically on the choice of parametrization procedure for the\ndiscrete-to-continuous transition. This can explain why a significant amount of\nrecent studies of the dynamics of AFMs, including effective models that\ndescribe the motion of antiferromagnetic domain walls, have neglected the\nintrinsic spin of the textured order parameter.\n", "  The size of the particle emission region in high-energy collisions can be\ndeduced using the femtoscopic correlations of particle pairs at low relative\nmomentum. Such correlations arise due to quantum statistics and Coulomb and\nstrong final state interactions. In this paper, results are presented from\nfemtoscopic analyses of $\\pi^{\\pm}\\pi^{\\pm}$, ${\\rm K}^{\\pm}{\\rm K}^{\\pm}$,\n${\\rm K}^{0}_S{\\rm K}^{0}_S$, ${\\rm pp}$, and ${\\rm \\overline{p}}{\\rm\n\\overline{p}}$ correlations from Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm\n{NN}}}=2.76$ TeV by the ALICE experiment at the LHC. One-dimensional radii of\nthe system are extracted from correlation functions in terms of the invariant\nmomentum difference of the pair. The comparison of the measured radii with the\npredictions from a hydrokinetic model is discussed. The pion and kaon source\nradii display a monotonic decrease with increasing average pair transverse mass\n$m_{\\rm T}$ which is consistent with hydrodynamic model predictions for central\ncollisions. The kaon and proton source sizes can be reasonably described by\napproximate $m_{\\rm T}$-scaling.\n", "  Muons produced in atmospheric cosmic ray showers account for the by far\ndominant part of the event yield in large-volume underground particle\ndetectors. The IceCube detector, with an instrumented volume of about a cubic\nkilometer, has the potential to conduct unique investigations on atmospheric\nmuons by exploiting the large collection area and the possibility to track\nparticles over a long distance. Through detailed reconstruction of energy\ndeposition along the tracks, the characteristics of muon bundles can be\nquantified, and individual particles of exceptionally high energy identified.\nThe data can then be used to constrain the cosmic ray primary flux and the\ncontribution to atmospheric lepton fluxes from prompt decays of short-lived\nhadrons.\n  In this paper, techniques for the extraction of physical measurements from\natmospheric muon events are described and first results are presented. The\nmultiplicity spectrum of TeV muons in cosmic ray air showers for primaries in\nthe energy range from the knee to the ankle is derived and found to be\nconsistent with recent results from surface detectors. The single muon energy\nspectrum is determined up to PeV energies and shows a clear indication for the\nemergence of a distinct spectral component from prompt decays of short-lived\nhadrons. The magnitude of the prompt flux, which should include a substantial\ncontribution from light vector meson di-muon decays, is consistent with current\ntheoretical predictions.\n", "  Geometric quantization of topologically massive and pure Yang- Mills theories\nis studied in 2+1 dimensions. Analogous to the topologically massive AdS\ngravity model, both topologically massive Yang-Mills and pure Yang-Mills\ntheories are shown to exhibit a Chern-Simons splitting behavior at large\ndistances. It is also shown that, this large distance topological behavior can\nbe further used to incorporate link invariants.\n", "  The production of the hypertriton nuclei $^{3}_{\\Lambda}\\mathrm H$ and\n$^{3}_{\\bar{\\Lambda}} \\overline{\\mathrm H}$ has been measured for the first\ntime in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV with the ALICE\nexperiment at LHC energies. The total yield, d$N$/d$y$ $\\times\n\\mathrm{B.R.}_{\\left( ^{3}_{\\Lambda}\\mathrm H \\rightarrow\n^{3}\\mathrm{He},\\pi^{-} \\right)} = \\left( 3.86 \\pm 0.77 (\\mathrm{stat.}) \\pm\n0.68 (\\mathrm{syst.})\\right) \\times 10^{-5}$ in the 0-10% most central\ncollisions, is consistent with the predictions from a statistical thermal model\nusing the same temperature as for the light hadrons. The coalescence parameter\n$B_3$ shows a dependence on the transverse momentum, similar to the $B_2$ of\ndeuterons and the $B_3$ of $^{3}\\mathrm{He}$ nuclei. The ratio of yields $S_3$\n= $^{3}_{\\Lambda}\\mathrm H$/($^{3}\\mathrm{He}$ $\\times \\Lambda/\\mathrm{p}$) was\nmeasured to be $S_3$ = 0.60 $\\pm$ 0.13 (stat.) $\\pm$ 0.21 (syst.) in 0-10%\ncentrality events; this value is compared to different theoretical models. The\nmeasured $S_3$ is fully compatible with thermal model predictions. The measured\n$^{3}_{\\Lambda}\\mathrm H$ lifetime, $ \\tau = 181^{+54}_{-39} (\\mathrm{stat.})\n\\pm 33 (\\mathrm{syst.})\\ \\mathrm{ps}$ is compatible within 1$\\sigma$ with the\nworld average value.\n", "  We present a measurement of inclusive J/$\\psi$ production in p-Pb collisions\nat $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV as a function of the centrality of the\ncollision, as estimated from the energy deposited in the Zero Degree\nCalorimeters. The measurement is performed with the ALICE detector down to zero\ntransverse momentum, $p_{\\rm T}$, in the backward ($-4.46 < y_{\\rm cms} <\n-2.96$) and forward ($2.03 < y_{\\rm cms} < 3.53$) rapidity intervals in the\ndimuon decay channel and in the mid-rapidity region ($-1.37 < y_{\\rm cms} <\n0.43$) in the dielectron decay channel. The backward and forward rapidity\nintervals correspond to the Pb-going and p-going direction, respectively. The\n$p_{\\rm T}$-differential J/$\\psi$ production cross section at backward and\nforward rapidity is measured for several centrality classes, together with the\ncorresponding average $p_{\\rm T}$ and $p^2_{\\rm T}$ values. The nuclear\nmodification factor, $Q_{\\rm pPb}$, is presented as a function of centrality\nfor the three rapidity intervals, and, additionally, at backward and forward\nrapidity, as a function of $p_{\\rm T}$ for several centrality classes. At mid-\nand forward rapidity, the J/$\\psi$ yield is suppressed up to 40% compared to\nthat in pp interactions scaled by the number of binary collisions. The degree\nof suppression increases towards central p-Pb collisions at forward rapidity,\nand with decreasing $p_{\\rm T}$ of the J/$\\psi$. At backward rapidity, the\n$Q_{\\rm pPb}$ is compatible with unity within the total uncertainties, with an\nincreasing trend from peripheral to central p-Pb collisions.\n", "  We study the anomalous $WW\\gamma$ couplings at the Compact Linear Collider\nthrough the processes $e^{+}e^{-}\\to W^+W^-$, $e^{-}e^{+} \\to e^{-} \\gamma^{*}\ne^{+} \\to e^{+} \\nu_{e} W^-$ and $e^{-}e^{+}\\to e^{-} \\gamma^{*} \\gamma^{*}\ne^{+} \\to e^{-} W^+ W^- e^{+} $ $ (\\gamma^{*}$ is the Weizsacker-Williams\nphoton). We give the 95\\% confidence level limits for unpolarized and polarized\nelectron (positron) beam on the anomalous couplings for various values of the\nintegrated luminosities and center-of-mass energies. We show that the obtained\nlimits on the anomalous couplings through these processes can highly improve\nthe current experimental limits. In addition, our limits with beam polarization\nare approximately two times better than the unpolarized case.\n", "  A Weyl semimetal possesses spin-polarized band-crossings, called Weyl nodes,\nconnected by topological surface arcs. The low-energy excitations near the\ncrossing points behave the same as massless Weyl fermions, leading to exotic\nproperties like chiral anomaly. To have the transport properties dominated by\nWeyl fermions, Weyl nodes need to locate nearly at the chemical potential and\nenclosed by pairs of individual Fermi surfaces with nonzero Fermi Chern\nnumbers. Combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and\nfirst-principles calculation, here we show that TaP is a Weyl semimetal with\nonly single type of Weyl fermions, topologically distinguished from TaAs where\ntwo types of Weyl fermions contribute to the low-energy physical properties.\nThe simple Weyl fermions in TaP are not only of fundamental interests but also\nof great potential for future applications. Fermi arcs on the Ta-terminated\nsurface are observed, which appear in a different pattern from that on the\nAs-termination in TaAs and NbAs.\n", "  We show that superconductors with broken time-reversal symmetry have very\nspecific magnetic and electric responses to inhomogeneous heating. A local\nheating of such superconductors induces a magnetic field with a profile that is\nsensitive to the presence of domain walls and crystalline anisotropy of\nsuperconducting states. A nonstationary heating process produces an electric\nfield and a charge imbalance in different bands. These effects can be measured\nand used to distinguish $s+is$ and $s+id$ superconducting states in the\ncandidate materials such as Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$.\n", "  A systematic first principles evaluation of the insertion behavior of\nmulti-valent cations in orthorhombic V$_2$O$_5$ is performed. Layer spacing,\nvoltage, phase stability, and ion mobility are computed for Li$^+$, Mg$^{2+}$,\nZn$^{2+}$, Ca$^{2+}$, and Al$^{3+}$ intercalation in the $\\alpha$ and $\\delta$\npolymorphs.\n", "  Recently, the effects of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in correlated materials\nhave become one of the most actively studied subjects in condensed matter\nphysics, as correlations and SOC together can lead to the discovery of new\nphases. Among candidate materials, iridium oxides (iridates) have been an\nexcellent playground to uncover such novel phenomena. In this review, we\ndiscuss recent progress in iridates and related materials, focusing on the\nbasic concepts, relevant microscopic Hamiltonians, and unusual properties of\niridates in perovskite- and honeycomb-based structures. Perspectives on SOC and\ncorrelation physics beyond iridates are also discussed.\n", "  Turbulence is thought to be a primary driving force behind the early stages\nof star formation. In this framework large, self gravitating, turbulent clouds\nfragment into smaller clouds which in turn fragment into even smaller ones. At\nthe end of this cascade we find the clouds which collapse into protostars.\nFollowing this process is extremely challenging numerically due to the large\ndynamical range so in this paper we propose a semi analytic framework which is\nable to follow star formation from the largest, giant molecular cloud (GMC)\nscale, to the final protostellar size scale. Due to the simplicity of the\nframework it is ideal for theoretical experimentation to explore the principal\nprocesses behind different aspects of star formation, at the cost of strong\nassumptions. The basic version of the model discussed in this paper only\ncontains turbulence, gravity and crude assumptions about feedback, nevertheless\nit can reproduce the observed core mass function (CMF) and provide the\nprotostellar system mass function (PSMF), which shows a striking resemblance to\nthe observed IMF. Furthermore we find that to produce a universal IMF\nprotostellar feedback must be taken into account otherwise the PSMF peak shows\na strong dependence on the background temperature.\n", "  Colloidal assembly represents a powerful method for the fabrication of\nfunctional materials. In this article, we describe how acoustic radiation\nforces can guide the assembly of colloidal particles into structures that serve\nas microscopic elements in novel acoustic metadevices or act as phononic\ncrystals. Using a simple three-dimensional orthogonal system, we show that a\ndiversity of colloidal structures with orthorhombic symmetry can be assembled\nwith megahertz-frequency (MHz) standing pressure waves. These structures allow\nrapid tuning of acoustic properties and provide a new platform for dynamic\nmetamaterial applications.\n", "  We report on the measurement of freeze-out radii for pairs of\nidentical-charge pions measured in Pb--Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm\nNN}}=2.76$ TeV as a function of collision centrality and the average transverse\nmomentum of the pair $k_{\\rm T}$. Three-dimensional sizes of the system\n(femtoscopic radii), as well as direction-averaged one-dimensional radii are\nextracted. The radii decrease with $k_{\\rm T}$, following a power-law behavior.\nThis is qualitatively consistent with expectations from a collectively\nexpanding system, produced in hydrodynamic calculations. The radii also scale\nlinearly with $\\left< \\mathrm{d}N_{\\rm ch}/\\mathrm{d}\\eta \\right>^{1/3}$. This\nbehaviour is compared to world data on femtoscopic radii in heavy-ion\ncollisions. While the dependence is qualitatively similar to results at smaller\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$, a decrease in the $R_{\\rm out}/R_{\\rm side}$ ratio is\nseen, which is in qualitative agreement with specific predictions from\nhydrodynamic models. The results provide further evidence for the production of\na collective, strongly coupled system in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC.\n", "  Dispersal between different habitats influences the dynamics and stability of\npopulations considerably. Furthermore, these effects depend on the local\ninteractions of a population with other species. Here, we perform a general and\ncomprehensive study of the simplest possible system that includes dispersal and\nlocal interactions, namely a 2-patch 2-species system. We evaluate the impact\nof dispersal on stability and on the occurrence of bifurcations, including\npattern forming bifurcations that lead to spatial heterogeneity, in 19\ndifferent classes of models with the help of the generalized modelling\napproach. We find that dispersal often destabilizes equilibria, but it can\nstabilize them if it increases population losses. If dispersal is nonrandom,\ni.e. if emigration or immigration rates depend on population densities, the\ncorrelation of stability with migration rates is positive in part of the\nmodels. We also find that many systems show all four types of bifurcations and\nthat antisynchronous oscillations occur mostly with nonrandom dispersal.\n", "  For the solution $q(t)=(q_n(t))_{n\\in\\mathbb Z}$ to one-dimensional discrete\nSchr\\\"odinger equation $${\\rm i}\\dot{q}_n=-(q_{n+1}+q_{n-1})+ V(\\theta+n\\omega)\nq_n, \\quad n\\in\\mathbb Z,$$ with $\\omega\\in\\mathbb R^d$ Diophantine, and $V$ a\nsmall real-analytic function on $\\mathbb T^d$, we consider the growth rate of\nthe diffusion norm $\\|q(t)\\|_{D}:=\\left(\\sum_{n}n^2|q_n(t)|^2\\right)^{\\frac12}$\nfor any non-zero $q(0)$ with $\\|q(0)\\|_{D}<\\infty$. We prove that\n$\\|q(t)\\|_{D}$ grows {\\it linearly} with the time $t$ for any $\\theta\\in\\mathbb\nT^d$ if $V$ is sufficiently small.\n", "  We analyze two abelian Higgs systems with nonstandard kinetic terms. We\nconsider a model involving the Maxwell term. For a particular choice of the\nnonstandard kinetics, we are able to obtain generalized Jackiw-Pi vortices. We,\nalso, analyze a generalization of the Jackiw-Pi model. In that case we show\nthat the system support the Nielsen-Olesen vortices as solutions.\n", "  We have has performed the first measurement of the coherent $\\psi$(2S)\nphoto-production cross section in ultra-peripheral Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC.\nThis charmonium excited state is reconstructed via the $\\psi$(2S) $\\rightarrow\nl^{+}l^{-}$ and $\\psi$(2S) $\\rightarrow$ J/$\\psi \\pi^{+}\\pi^{-}$ decays, where\nthe J/$\\psi$ decays into two leptons. The analysis is based on an event sample\ncorresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 22 $\\mu\\rm{b}^{-1}$. The\ncross section for coherent $\\psi$(2S) production in the rapidity interval\n$-0.9<y<0.9$ is $\\mathrm{d}\\sigma_{\\psi{\\rm(2S)}}^{\\rm coh}/\\mathrm{d}y\n=0.83\\pm 0.19\\big(\\mathrm{\\rm{stat}+{\\rm syst}}\\big)$ mb. The $\\psi$(2S) to\nJ/$\\psi$ coherent cross section ratio is $0.34^{+0.08}_{-0.07}(\\rm{stat}+{\\rm\nsyst})$. The obtained results are compared to predictions from theoretical\nmodels.\n", "  Instabilities and long term shifts in seasons, whether induced by natural\ndrivers or human activities, pose great disruptive threats to ecological,\nagricultural, and social systems. Here, we propose, measure, and explore two\nfundamental markers of location-sensitive seasonal variations: the Summer and\nWinter Teletherms---the on-average annual dates of the hottest and coldest days\nof the year. We analyse daily temperature extremes recorded at 1218 stations\nacross the contiguous United States from 1853--2012, and observe large regional\nvariation with the Summer Teletherm falling up to 90 days after the Summer\nSolstice, and 50 days for the Winter Teletherm after the Winter Solstice. We\nshow that Teletherm temporal dynamics are substantive with clear and in some\ncases dramatic shifts reflective of system bifurcations. We also compare\nrecorded daily temperature extremes with output from two regional climate\nmodels finding considerable though relatively unbiased error. Our work\ndemonstrates that Teletherms are an intuitive, powerful, and statistically\nsound measure of local climate change, and that they pose detailed, stringent\nchallenges for future theoretical and computational models.\n", "  We investigate how nontrivial topology affects the entanglement dynamics\nbetween a detector and a quantum field and between two detectors mediated by a\nquantum field. Nontrivial topology refers to both that of the base space and\nthat of the bundle. Using a derivative-coupling Unruh-DeWitt-like detector\nmodel interacting with a quantum scalar field in an Einstein cylinder S1\n(space) x R1 (time), we see the beating behaviors in the dynamics of the\ndetector-field entanglement and the detector-detector entanglement, which\ndistinguish from the results in the non-compact (1+1) dimensional Minkowski\nspace. The beat patterns of entanglement dynamics in a normal and a twisted\nfield with the same parameter values are different because of the difference in\nthe spectrum of the field modes. In terms of the kinetic momentum of the\ndetectors, we find that the contribution by the zero mode in a normal field to\nentanglement dynamics has no qualitative difference from those by the nonzero\nmodes.\n", "  A quantum heat engine of a specific type is studied. This engine contains a\nsingle particle confined in the infinite square well potential with variable\nwidth and consists of three processes: the isoenergetic process (which has no\nclassical analogs) as well as the isothermal and adiabatic processes. It is\nfound that the engine possesses exotic properties in its performance. The\nefficiency takes the maximum value when the expansion ratio of the engine is\nappropriately set, and, in addition, the lower the temperature is, the higher\nthe maximum efficiency becomes, highlighting aspects of the influence of\nquantum effects on thermodynamics. A comment is also made on the relevance of\nthis engine to that of Carnot.\n", "  We propose a method to determine the quantum numbers, which we call the\nrigged configurations, for the solutions to the Bethe ansatz equations for the\nspin-1/2 isotropic Heisenberg model under the periodic boundary condition. Our\nmethod is based on the observation that the sums of Bethe's quantum numbers\nwithin each string behave particularly nicely. We confirm our procedure for all\nsolutions for length 12 chain (totally 923 solutions).\n", "  On the twentieth anniversary of the observation of the top quark, we trace\nour understanding of this heaviest of all known particles from the prediction\nof its existence, through the searches and discovery, to the current knowledge\nof its production mechanisms and properties. We also discuss the central role\nof the top quark in the Standard Model and the windows that it opens for\nseeking new physics beyond the Standard Model.\n", "  From inherent non-linearity two gravitational waves, unless they are\nunidirectional, fail to satisfy a superposition law. They collide to develop a\nnew spacetime carrying the imprints of the incoming waves. Same behaviour is\nvalid also for any massless lightlike field. As a result of the violent\ncollision process either a naked singularity or a Cauchy horizon (CH) develops.\nIt was shown by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (CX) that a particular class of\ncolliding gravitational waves (CGW) spacetime is locally isometric to the Kerr\nmetric for rotating black holes. This relation came to be known as the CX\nduality. Such a duality can be exploited as an alternative derivation for the\nKerr metric as we do herein. Not each case gives rise to a CH but those which\ndo are transient to a black hole state provided stability requirements are met.\nThese classical considerations can be borrowed to shed light on black hole\nformation in high energy collisions. Their questionable stability and many\nother sophisticated agenda, we admit that await for a full - fledged quantum\ngravity. Yet, to add an element of novelty, a quantum probe is sent in the\nplane $\\theta =\\pi /2$ to the naked ring singularity of Kerr which develops for\nthe overspinning case $(a>M)$ to test it from a quantum picture. We show that\nthe spatial operator of the reduced Klein-Gordon equation has a unique\nself-adjoint extension. As a result, the classical Kerr`s ring singularity is\nhealed and becomes quantum regular. Our poetic message of the paper is\nsummarized as\n  Let there be light\n  that collide with might\n  to disperse the night\n  and create holes that are white\n", "  The ATLAS experiment has performed extensive searches for the electroweak\nproduction of charginos, neutralinos and staus. This article summarizes and\nextends the search for electroweak supersymmetry with new analyses targeting\nscenarios not covered by previously published searches. New searches use\nvector-boson fusion production, initial-state radiation jets, and low-momentum\nlepton final states, as well as multivariate analysis techniques to improve the\nsensitivity to scenarios with small mass splittings and low-production\ncross-sections. Results are based on 20 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision\ndata at $\\sqrt{s}$=8 TeV recorded with the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron\nCollider. No significant excess beyond Standard Model expectations is observed.\nThe new and existing searches are combined and interpreted in terms of 95%\nconfidence-level exclusion limits in simplified models, where a single\nproduction process and decay mode is assumed, as well as within\nphenomenological supersymmetric models.\n", "  The centrality dependence of the charged-particle pseudorapidity density\nmeasured with ALICE in Pb-Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ over a broad\npseudorapidity range is presented. This Letter extends the previous results\nreported by ALICE to more peripheral collisions. No strong change of the\ncharged-particle pseudorapidity density distributions with centrality is\nobserved, and when normalised to the number of participating nucleons in the\ncollisions, the evolution over pseudorapidity with centrality is likewise\nsmall. The broad pseudorapidity range allows precise estimates of the total\nnumber of produced charged particles which we find to range from $162\\pm22$\n(syst.) to $17170\\pm770$ (syst.) in 80-90% and 0-5 central collisions,\nrespectively. The total charged-particle multiplicity is seen to approximately\nscale with the number of participating nucleons in the collision. This suggests\nthat hard contributions to the charged-particle multiplicity are limited. The\nresults are compared to models which describe\n$\\mbox{d}N_{\\mbox{ch}}/\\mbox{d}\\eta$ at mid-rapidity in the most central Pb-Pb\ncollisions and it is found that these models do not capture all features of the\ndistributions.\n", "  Direct photon production at mid-rapidity in Pb-Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{_{\\mathrm{NN}}}} = 2.76$ TeV was studied in the transverse momentum\nrange $0.9 < p_\\mathrm{T} < 14$ GeV$/c$. Photons were detected with the highly\nsegmented electromagnetic calorimeter PHOS and via conversions in the ALICE\ndetector material with the $e^+e^-$ pair reconstructed in the central tracking\nsystem. The results of the two methods were combined and direct photon spectra\nwere measured for the 0-20%, 20-40%, and 40-80% centrality classes. For all\nthree classes, agreement was found with perturbative QCD calculations for\n$p_\\mathrm{T} \\gtrsim 5$ GeV$/c$. Direct photon spectra down to $p_\\mathrm{T}\n\\approx 1$ GeV$/c$ could be extracted for the 20-40% and 0-20% centrality\nclasses. The significance of the direct photon signal for $0.9 < p_\\mathrm{T} <\n2.1$ GeV$/c$ is $2.6\\sigma$ for the 0-20% class. The spectrum in this\n$p_\\mathrm{T}$ range and centrality class can be described by an exponential\nwith an inverse slope parameter of $(297 \\pm 12^\\mathrm{stat}\\pm\n41^\\mathrm{syst})$ MeV. State-of-the-art models for photon production in\nheavy-ion collisions agree with the data within uncertainties.\n", "  We present measurements of the azimuthal dependence of charged jet production\nin central and semi-central $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb\ncollisions with respect to the second harmonic event plane, quantified as\n$v_{2}^{\\mathrm{ch~jet}}$. Jet finding is performed employing the\nanti-$k_{\\mathrm{T}}$ algorithm with a resolution parameter $R$ = 0.2 using\ncharged tracks from the ALICE tracking system. The contribution of the\nazimuthal anisotropy of the underlying event is taken into account\nevent-by-event. The remaining (statistical) region-to-region fluctuations are\nremoved on an ensemble basis by unfolding the jet spectra for different event\nplane orientations independently. Significant non-zero\n$v_{2}^{\\mathrm{ch~jet}}$ is observed in semi-central collisions (30-50\\%\ncentrality) for 20 $<$ $p_{\\mathrm{T}}^{\\rm ch~jet}$ $<$ 90\n${\\mathrm{GeV}\\kern-0.05em/\\kern-0.02em c}$. The azimuthal dependence of the\ncharged jet production is similar to the dependence observed for jets\ncomprising both charged and neutral fragments, and compatible with measurements\nof the $v_2$ of single charged particles at high $p_{\\mathrm{T}}$. Good\nagreement between the data and predictions from JEWEL, an event generator\nsimulating parton shower evolution in the presence of a dense QCD medium, is\nfound in semi-central collisions.\n", "  We present an extension to next-to-leading order in the strong coupling\nconstant $g$ of the AMY effective kinetic approach to the energy loss of high\nmomentum particles in the quark-gluon plasma. At leading order, the transport\nof jet-like particles is determined by elastic scattering with the thermal\nconstituents, and by inelastic collinear splittings induced by the medium. We\nreorganize this description into collinear splittings, high-momentum-transfer\nscatterings, drag and diffusion, and particle conversions (momentum-preserving\nidentity-changing processes). We show that this reorganized description remains\nvalid to NLO in $g$, and compute the appropriate modifications of the drag,\ndiffusion, particle conversion, and inelastic splitting coefficients. In\naddition, a new kinematic regime opens at NLO for wider-angle collinear\nbremsstrahlung. These semi-collinear emissions smoothly interpolate between the\nleading order high-momentum-transfer scatterings and collinear splittings. To\norganize the calculation, we introduce a set of Wilson line operators on the\nlight-cone which determine the diffusion and identity changing coefficients,\nand we show how to evaluate these operators at NLO.\n", "  A weighted difference of the $g$-factors of the H- and Li-like ions of the\nsame element is theoretically studied and optimized in order to maximize the\ncancelation of nuclear effects between the two charge states. We show that this\nweighted difference and its combination for two different elements can be used\nto extract a value for the fine-structure constant from near-future\nbound-electron $g$-factor experiments with an accuracy competitive with or\nbetter than the present literature value.\n", "  We identify a scalar-tensor model embedded in the Horndeski action whose\ncosmological background and linear scalar fluctuations are degenerate with the\nconcordance cosmology. The model admits a self-accelerated background expansion\nat late times that is stable against perturbations with a sound speed\nattributed to the new field that is equal to the speed of light. While\ndegenerate in scalar fluctuations, self-acceleration of the model implies a\npresent cosmological tensor mode propagation at < 95% of the speed of light\nwith a damping of the wave amplitude that is > 5% less efficient than in\ngeneral relativity. We show that these discrepancies are endemic to\nself-accelerated Horndeski theories with degenerate large-scale structure and\nare tested with measurements of gravitational waves emitted by events at\ncosmological distances. Hence, gravitational-wave cosmology breaks the dark\ndegeneracy in observations of the large-scale structure between two\nfundamentally different explanations of cosmic acceleration - a cosmological\nconstant and a scalar-tensor modification of gravity. The gravitational wave\nevent GW150914 recently detected with the aLIGO instruments and its potential\nassociation with a weak short gamma-ray burst observed with the Fermi GBM\nexperiment may have provided this crucial measurement.\n", "  We study the behavior of classical dimer coverings of the square lattice - a\nparadigmatic model for systems subject to constraints - evolving under local\nstochastic dynamics, by means of Monte Carlo simulations and theoretical\narguments. We observe clear signatures of correlated dynamics in both global\nand local observables and over a broad range of time scales, indicating a\nbreakdown of the simple continuum description that approximates well the\nstatics. We show that this collective dynamics can be understood in terms of\none-dimensional \"strings\" of high mobility, which govern both local and\nlong-wavelength dynamical properties. We introduce a coarse-grained description\nof the strings, based on the Edwards-Wilkinson model, which leads to exact\nresults in the limit of low string density and provides a detailed qualitative\nunderstanding of the dynamics in all flux sectors. We discuss the implications\nof our results for the dynamics of constrained systems more generally.\n", "  The pseudorapidity ($\\eta$) and transverse-momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$)\ndistributions of charged particles produced in proton-proton collisions are\nmeasured at the centre-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. The pseudorapidity\ndistribution in $|\\eta|<$ 1.8 is reported for inelastic events and for events\nwith at least one charged particle in $|\\eta|<$ 1. The pseudorapidity density\nof charged particles produced in the pseudorapidity region $|\\eta|<$ 0.5 is\n5.31 $\\pm$ 0.18 and 6.46 $\\pm$ 0.19 for the two event classes, respectively.\nThe transverse-momentum distribution of charged particles is measured in the\nrange 0.15 $<$ $p_{\\rm T}$ $<$ 20 GeV/c and $|\\eta|<$ 0.8 for events with at\nleast one charged particle in $|\\eta|<$ 1. The correlation between transverse\nmomentum and particle multiplicity is also investigated by studying the\nevolution of the spectra with event multiplicity. The results are compared with\ncalculations from PYTHIA and EPOS Monte Carlo generators.\n", "  The quartet of galaxies NGC 7769, 7770, 7771 and 7771A is a system of\ninteracting galaxies. Close interaction between galaxies caused characteristic\nmorphological features: tidal arms and bars, as well as an induced star\nformation. In this study, we performed the Fabry-Perot scanning interferometry\nof the system in Ha line and studied the velocity fields of the galaxies. We\nfound that the rotation curve of NGC 7769 is weakly distorted. The rotation\ncurve of NGC 7771 is strongly distorted with the tidal arms caused by direct\nflyby of NGC 7769 and flyby of a smaller neighbor NGC 7770. The rotation curve\nof NGC 7770 is significantly skewed because of the interaction with the much\nmassive NGC 7771. The rotation curves and morphological disturbances suggest\nthat the NGC 7769 and NGC 7771 have passed the first pericenter stage, however,\nprobably the second encounter has not happened yet. Profiles of surface\nbrightness of NGC 7769 have a characteristic break, and profiles of color\nindices have a minimum at a radius of intensive star formation induced by the\ninteraction with NGC 7771.\n", "  We study theoretically the superconductivity in doped Weyl semimetals with an\ninversion symmetry based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. In principle,\nthe two superconducting states, i.e., the zero momentum BCS-like pairing and\nthe finite momentum Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing are\ncompeting in this kind of systems. Our self-consistent calculation indicates\nthat the BCS-type state may be the ground state. The competition between these\ntwo pairing states is studied in detail through normal state Fermi surface and\nthe finite energy spectral functions. Generally, the Fermi surface topology\nsupports the FFLO pairing while the finite energy band structure favors the\nBCS-type pairing. We also study the physical properties and address the\nMajorana Fermions excitation in these two superconducting state respectively.\n", "  We calculate the dispersion relations of plasmonic waves propagating along a\nchain of semiconducting or metallic nanoparticles in the presence of both a\nstatic magnetic field ${\\bf B}$ and a liquid crystalline host. The dispersion\nrelations are obtained using the quasistatic approximation and a dipole-dipole\napproximation to treat the interaction between surface plasmons on different\nnanoparticles. For a plasmons propagating along a particle chain in a nematic\nliquid crystalline host with both ${\\bf B}$ and the director parallel to the\nchain, we find a small, but finite, Faraday rotation angle. For ${\\bf B}$\nperpendicular to the chain, but director still parallel to the chain, the field\ncouples the longitudinal and one of the two transverse plasmonic branches. This\ncoupling is shown to split the two branches at the zero field crossing by an\namount proportional to $|{\\bf B}|$. In a cholesteric liquid crystal host and an\napplied magnetic field parallel to the chain, the dispersion relations for\nleft- and right-moving waves are found to be different. For some frequencies,\nthe plasmonic wave propagates only in one of the two directions.\n", "  These are intended to be review notes on emergent symmetries, i.e.,\nsymmetries which manifest themselves in specific sectors of energy in many\nsystems. The emphasis is on the physical aspects rather than computation\nmethods. We include some background material and go through more recent\nproblems in field theory, statistical mechanics and condensed matter. These\nproblems illustrate how some important symmetries, such as Lorentz invariance\nand supersymmetry, usually believed to be fundamental, can arise naturally in\nlow-energy regimes of systems involving a large number of degrees of freedom.\nThe aim is to discuss how these examples could help us to face other complex\nand fundamental problems.\n", "  The Korea Invisible Mass Search (KIMS) collaboration has developed\nlow-background NaI(Tl) crystals that are suitable for the direct detection of\nWIMP dark matter. With experience built on the KIMS-CsI programs, the KIMS-NaI\nexperiment will consist of a 200~kg NaI(Tl) crystal array surrounded by layers\nof shielding structures and will be operated at the Yangyang underground\nlaboratory. The goal is to provide an unambiguous test of the DAMA/LIBRA's\nannual modulation signature. Measurements of six prototype crystals show\nprogress in the reduction of internal contaminations of radioisotopes. Based on\nour understanding of these measurements, we expect to achieve a background\nlevel in the final detector configuration that is less than 1~count/day/keV/kg\nfor recoil energies around 2~keV. The annual modulation sensitivity for the\nKIMS-NaI experiment shows that an unambiguous 7$\\sigma$ test of the DAMA/LIBRA\nsignature would be possible with a 600~kg$\\cdot$year exposure with this system.\n", "  We investigate Second Harmonic Generation from individual silicon nanowires\nand study the influence of resonant optical modes on the far-field nonlinear\nemission. We find that the polarization of the Second Harmonic has a\nsize-dependent behavior and explain this phenomenon by a combination of\ndifferent surface and bulk nonlinear susceptibility contributions. We show that\nthe Second Harmonic Generation has an entirely different origin, depending on\nwhether the incident illumination is polarized parallel or perpendicularly to\nthe nanowire axis. The results open perspectives for further geometry-based\nstudies on the origin of Second Harmonic Generation in nanostructures of\nhigh-index centrosymmetric semiconductors.\n", "  We study the coherence properties of a laser beam after propagation along a\none-dimensional lossless nonlinear optical waveguide. Within the paraxial,\nslowly-varying-envelope, and single-transverse-mode approximations, the quantum\npropagation of the light field in the nonlinear medium is mapped onto a quantum\nGross-Pitaevskii-type evolution of a closed one-dimensional system of many\ninteracting photons. Upon crossing the entrance and the back faces of the\nwaveguide, the photon-photon interaction parameter undergoes two sudden jumps,\nresulting in a pair of quantum quenches of the system's Hamiltonian. In the\nweak-interaction regime, we use the modulus-phase Bogoliubov theory of dilute\nBose gases to describe the quantum fluctuations of the fluid of light and\npredict that correlations typical of a prethermalized state emerge locally in\ntheir final form and propagate in a light-cone way at the Bogoliubov speed of\nsound in the photon fluid. This peculiar relaxation dynamics, visible in the\nlight exiting the waveguide, results in a loss of long-lived coherence in the\nbeam of light.\n", "  Synthetic ladders realized with one-dimensional alkaline-earth(-like)\nfermionic gases and subject to a gauge field represent a promising environment\nfor the investigation of quantum Hall physics with ultracold atoms. Using\ndensity-matrix renormalization group calculations, we study how the quantum\nHall-like chiral edge currents are affected by repulsive atom-atom\ninteractions. We relate the properties of such currents to the asymmetry of the\nspin resolved momentum distribution function, a quantity which is easily\naddressable in state-of-art experiments. We show that repulsive interactions\nsignificantly stabilize the quantum Hall-like helical region and enhance the\nchiral currents. Our numerical simulations are performed for atoms with two and\nthree internal spin states.\n", "  We show how the elusive toroidal dipole moment appears as a radiative\nexcitation eigenmode in a metamolecule resonator that is formed by pairs of\nplasmonic nanorods. We analyze one such nanorod configuration - a toroidal\nmetamolecule. We find that the radiative interactions in the toroidal\nmetamolecule can be qualitatively represented by a theoretical model based on\nan electric point dipole arrangement. Both a finite-size rod model and the\npoint dipole approximation demonstrate how the toroidal dipole moment is\nsubradiant and difficult to excite by incident light. By means of breaking the\ngeometric symmetry of the metamolecule, the toroidal mode can be excited by\nlinearly polarized light and appears as a Fano resonance dip in the forward\nscattered light. We provide simple optimization protocols for maximizing the\ntoroidal dipole mode excitation. This opens up possibilities for simplified\ncontrol and driving of metamaterial arrays consisting of toroidal dipole\nunit-cell resonators.\n", "  We describe how monomial chaotic inflation becomes compatible with the latest\nCMB data thanks to radiative corrections producing a plateau. The interactions\nof the inflation with other fields, required for reheating, can flatten the\npotential and moderate the production of primordial gravitational waves,\nkeeping these below the current upper bound. We show that the appearance of a\nplateau requires that the inflaton couples to fermions and to another scalar or\na gauge group. We give concrete examples of minimal particle physics models\nleading to plateaus for quadratic and quartic chaotic inflation. We also\nprovide a three-parameter model-independent description of radiatively\ncorrected inflation that is amenable to CMB analyses.\n", "  From the steam engine to current nano-devices, the design of efficient\nthermal machines has been instrumental in modern societies. In its essence a\nthermal engine can be thought as a working substance, in contact with two or\nmore baths, undergoing a cyclic transformation. What happens if the working\nsubstance is on the verge of a phase transition? Already in 1902 the latent\nheat was identified as a key to improve the efficiency of steam engines Despite\nthis early observation, the impact of phase transitions on the performance of\nthermal machines has not been addressed. By combining the tools of\nnon-equilibrium and quantum thermodynamics with finite-size-scaling and\ninformation theory, we unveil an unnoticed mechanism, triggered by the vicinity\nto a phase transition, to boost the performance of an engine. This result sheds\nnew light on the so called power-efficiency dilemma and could be used to\nrealise powerful and, at the same time, efficient engines. Specific\nimplementations with trapped ions and superconducting nano-circuits will be\ndiscussed.\n", "  We derive an explicit expression for the kernel of the evolution group\n$\\exp(-\\mathrm{i} t H_0)$ of the discrete Laguerre operator $H_0$ (i.e. the\nJacobi operator associated with the Laguerre polynomials) in terms of Jacobi\npolynomials. Based on this expression we show that the norm of the evolution\ngroup acting from $\\ell^1$ to $\\ell^\\infty$ is given by $(1+t^2)^{-1/2}$.\n", "  In daily life, subjects often face a social dilemma in two stages. In Stage\n1, they recognize the social dilemma structure of the decision problem at hand\n(a tension between personal interest and collective interest); in Stage 2, they\nhave to choose between gathering additional information to learn the exact\npayoffs corresponding to each of the two options or making a choice without\nlooking at the payoffs. While previous theoretical research suggests that the\nmere act of considering one's strategic options in a social dilemma will be met\nwith distrust, no experimental study has tested this hypothesis. What does\n\"looking at payoffs\" signal in observers? Do observers' beliefs actually match\ndecision makers' intentions? Experiment 1 shows that the actual action of\nlooking at payoffs signals selfish behavior, but it does not actually mean so.\nExperiments 2 and 3 show that, when the action of looking at payoffs is\nreplaced by a self-report question asking the extent to which participants look\nat payoffs in their everyday lives, subjects in high looking mode are indeed\nmore selfish than those in low looking mode, and this is correctly predicted by\nobservers. These results support Rand and colleagues' Social Heuristics\nHypothesis and the novel \"cooperate without looking\" model by Yoeli, Hoffman,\nand Nowak. However, Experiment 1 shows that actual looking may lead to\ndifferent results, possibly caused by the emergence of a moral cleansing\neffect.\n", "  We investigate the role of symmetries in determining the random matrix class\ndescribing quantum thermalization in a periodically driven many body quantum\nsystem. Using a combination of analytical arguments and numerical exact\ndiagonalization, we establish that a periodically driven `Floquet' system can\nbe in a different random matrix class to the instantaneous Hamiltonian. A\nperiodically driven system can thermalize even when the instantaneous\nHamiltonian is integrable. A Floquet system that thermalizes in general can\ndisplay integrable behavior at commensurate driving frequencies. When the\ninstantaneous Hamiltonian and Floquet operator both thermalize, the Floquet\nproblem can be in the unitary class while the instantaneous Hamiltonian is\nalways in the orthogonal class, and vice versa. We extract general principles\nregarding when a Floquet problem can thermalize to a different symmetry class\nto the instantaneous Hamiltonian. A (finite-sized) Floquet system can even\ndisplay crossovers between different random matrix classes as a function of\ndriving frequency.\n", "  We investigate the interplay between mutual unbiasedness and product bases\nfor multiple qudits of possibly different dimensions. A product state of such a\nsystem is shown to be mutually unbiased to a product basis only if each of its\nfactors is mutually unbiased to all the states which occur in the corresponding\nfactors of the product basis. This result implies both a tight limit on the\nnumber of mutually unbiased product bases which the system can support and a\ncomplete classification of mutually unbiased product bases for multiple qubits\nor qutrits. In addition, only maximally entangled states can be mutually\nunbiased to a maximal set of mutually unbiased product bases.\n", "  We construct quasilocal conserved charges in the gapless ($|\\Delta| \\le 1$)\nregime of the Heisenberg $XXZ$ spin-$1/2$ chain, using semicyclic irreducible\nrepresentations of $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. These representations are\ncharacterized by a periodic action of ladder operators, which act as generators\nof the aforementioned algebra. Unlike previously constructed conserved charges,\nthe new ones do not preserve magnetization, i.e. they do not possess the $U(1)$\nsymmetry of the Hamiltonian. The possibility of application in relaxation\ndynamics resulting from $U(1)$-breaking quantum quenches is discussed.\n", "  We observe interaction-induced broadening of the two-photon 5s-18s transition\nin 87Rb atoms trapped in a 3D optical lattice. The measured linewidth increases\nby nearly two orders of magnitude with increasing atomic density and excitation\nstrength, with corresponding suppression of resonant scattering and enhancement\nof off-resonant scattering. We attribute the increased linewidth to resonant\ndipole-dipole interactions of 18s atoms with spontaneously created populations\nof nearby np states. Over a range of initial atomic densities and excitation\nstrengths, the transition width is described by a single function of the\nsteady-state density of Rydberg atoms, and the observed resonant excitation\nrate corresponds to that of a two-level system with the measured, rather than\nnatural, linewidth. The broadening mechanism observed here is likely to have\nnegative implications for many proposals with coherently interacting Rydberg\natoms.\n", "  In the sixties, DeWitt discovered that the advanced and retarded Green\nfunctions of the wave operator on metric perturbations in the de Donder gauge\nmake it possible to define classical Poisson brackets on the space of\nfunctionals that are invariant under the action of the full diffeomorphism\ngroup of spacetime. He therefore tried to exploit this property to define\ninvariant commutators for the quantized gravitational field, but the operator\ncounterpart of such classical Poisson brackets turned out to be a hard task. On\nthe other hand, the mathematical literature studies often an approximate\ninverse, the parametrix, which is, strictly, a distribution. We here suggest\nthat such a construction might be exploited in canonical quantum gravity. We\nbegin with the simplest case, i.e. fundamental solution and parametrix for the\nlinear, scalar wave operator; the next step are tensor wave equations, again\nfor linear theory, e.g. Maxwell theory in curved spacetime. Last, the nonlinear\nEinstein equations are studied, relying upon the well-established\nChoquet-Bruhat construction, according to which the fifth derivatives of\nsolutions of a nonlinear hyperbolic system solve a linear hyperbolic system.\nThe latter is solved by means of Kirchhoff-type formulas, while the former\nfifth-order equations can be solved by means of well-established parametrix\ntechniques for elliptic operators. But then the metric components that solve\nthe vacuum Einstein equations can be obtained by convolution of such a\nparametrix with Kirchhoff-type formulas. Some basic functional equations for\nthe parametrix are also obtained, that help in studying classical and quantum\nversion of the Jacobi identity.\n", "  Social dynamics on a network may be accelerated or decelerated depending on\nwhich pairs of individuals in the network communicate early and which pairs do\nlater. The order with which the links in a given network are sequentially used,\nwhich we call the link order, may be a strong determinant of dynamical\nbehaviour on networks, potentially adding a new dimension to effects of\ntemporal networks relative to static networks. Here we study the effect of the\nlink order on linear coordination (i.e., synchronisation) dynamics. We show\nthat the coordination speed considerably depends on specific orders of links.\nIn addition, applying each single link for a long time to ensure strong\npairwise coordination before moving to a next pair of individuals does not\noften enhance coordination of the entire network. We also implement a simple\ngreedy algorithm to optimise the link order in favour of fast coordination.\n", "  We study analytically the dynamics and the micro-structural changes of a host\nmedium caused by a driven tracer particle moving in a confined, quiescent\nmolecular crowding environment. Imitating typical settings of active\nmicro-rheology experiments, we consider here a minimal model comprising a\ngeometrically confined lattice system -- a two-dimensional strip-like or a\nthree-dimensional capillary-like -- populated by two types of hard-core\nparticles with stochastic dynamics -- a tracer particle driven by a constant\nexternal force and bath particles moving completely at random. Resorting to a\ndecoupling scheme, which permits us to go beyond the linear-response\napproximation (Stokes regime) for arbitrary densities of the lattice gas\nparticles, we determine the force-velocity relation for the tracer particle and\nthe stationary density profiles of the host medium particles around it. These\nresults are validated a posteriori by extensive numerical simulations for a\nwide range of parameters. Our theoretical analysis reveals two striking\nfeatures: a) We show that, under certain conditions, the terminal velocity of\nthe driven tracer particle is a nonmonotonic function of the force, so that in\nsome parameter range the differential mobility becomes negative, and b) the\nbiased particle drives the whole system into a nonequilibrium steady-state with\na stationary particle density profile past the tracer, which decays\nexponentially, in sharp contrast with the behavior observed for unbounded\nlattices, where an algebraic decay is known to take place.\n", "  We present the first complete next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD\npredictions for differential distributions in the top-quark pair production\nprocess at the LHC. Our results are derived from a fully differential partonic\nMonte Carlo calculation with stable top quarks which involves no approximations\nbeyond the fixed-order truncation of the perturbation series. The NNLO\ncorrections improve the agreement between existing LHC measurements [V.\nKhachatryan et al. (CMS Collaboration), Eur. Phys. J. C 75, 542 (2015)] and\nstandard model predictions for the top-quark transverse momentum distribution,\nthus helping alleviate one long-standing discrepancy. The shape of the\ntop-quark pair invariant mass distribution turns out to be stable with respect\nto radiative corrections beyond NLO which increases the value of this\nobservable as a place to search for physics beyond the standard model. The\nresults presented here provide essential input for parton distribution function\nfits, implementation of higher-order effects in Monte Carlo generators as well\nas top-quark mass and strong coupling determination.\n", "  We study the $TT\\mu$ bispectrum, generated by correlations between Cosmic\nMicrowave Background temperature (T) anisotropies and chemical potential\n($\\mu$) distortions, and we analyze its dependence on primordial local\ntrispectrum parameters $g_{\\rm NL}$ and $\\tau_{\\rm NL}$. We cross-check our\nresults by comparing the full bispectrum calculation with the expectations from\na general physical argument, based on predicting the shape of $\\mu$-T\ncorrelations from the couplings between short and long perturbation modes\ninduced by primordial non-Gaussianity. We show that $both$ $g_{\\rm NL}$ and\n$\\tau_{\\rm NL}$-parts of the primordial trispectrum source a non-vanishing\n$TT\\mu$ signal, contrary to the $\\mu\\mu$ auto-correlation function, which is\nsensitive only to the $\\tau_{\\rm NL}$-component. A simple Fisher matrix-based\nforecast shows that a futuristic, cosmic-variance dominated experiment could in\nprinciple detect $g_{\\rm NL} \\sim 0.4$ and $\\tau_{\\rm NL} \\sim 40$ using\n$TT\\mu$.\n", "  In this article, we construct a class of constant curvature and spherically\nsymmetric thin-shell Lorentzian wormholes in F(R) theories of gravity and we\nanalyze their stability under perturbations preserving the symmetry. We find\nthat the junction conditions determine the equation of state of the matter at\nthe throat. As a particular case, we consider configurations with mass and\ncharge. We obtain that stable static solutions are possible for suitable values\nof the parameters of the model.\n", "  Recently, we have demonstrated that there exists a possible relationship\nbetween q-deformed algebras in two different contexts of Statistical Mechanics,\nnamely, the Tsallis' framework and the Kaniadakis' scenario, with a local form\nof fractional-derivative operators for fractal media, the so-called Hausdorff\nderivatives, mapped into a continuous medium with a fractal measure. Here, in\nthis paper, we present an extension of the traditional calculus of variations\nfor systems containing deformed-derivatives embedded into the Lagrangian and\nthe Lagrangian densities for classical and field systems. The results extend\nthe classical Euler-Lagrange equations and the Hamiltonian formalism. The\nresulting dynamical equations seem to be compatible with those found in the\nliterature, specially with mass-dependent and with nonlinear equations for\nsystems in classical and quantum mechanics. Examples are presented to\nillustrate applications of the formulation. Also, the conserved Nether current,\nare worked out.\n", "  Combining galaxy cluster and void abundances breaks the degeneracy between\nmean matter density $\\Omega_{\\rm m}$ and power spectrum normalization\n$\\sigma_8$. In a first for voids, we constrain $\\Omega_{\\rm m} = 0.21 \\pm 0.10$\nand $\\sigma_8 = 0.95 \\pm 0.21$ for a flat $\\Lambda$CDM universe, using\nextreme-value statistics on the claimed largest cluster and void. The\nPlanck-consistent results detect dark energy with two objects, independently of\nother dark energy probes. Cluster-void studies also offer complementarity in\nscale, density, and non-linearity - of particular interest for testing\nmodified-gravity models.\n", "  The Dirac Hamiltonian including nuclear recoil and vacuum-polarization\noperators is considered in a supercritical regime Z > 137. It is found that the\nnuclear recoil operator derived within the Breit approximation regularizes the\nHamiltonian for the point-nucleus model and allows the ground state level to go\ncontinuously down and reach the negative energy continuum at a critical value\nZcr = 145. If the Hamiltonian contains both the recoil operator and the Uehling\npotential, the 1s level reaches the negative energy continuum at Zcr = 144. The\ncorresponding calculations for the excited states have been also performed.\nThis study shows that, in contrast to previous investigations, a point-like\nnucleus can have effectively the charge Z > 137.\n", "  In this work we study the majority-vote model with the presence of two\ndistinc noises. The first one is the usual noise $q$, that represents the\nprobability that a given agent follows the minority opinion of his/her social\ncontacts. On the other hand, we consider the independent behavior, such that an\nagent can choose his/her own opinion $+1$ or $-1$ with equal probability,\nindependent of the group's norm. We study the impact of the presence of such\ntwo kinds of stochastic driving in the phase transitions of the model,\nconsidering the mean field and the square lattice cases. Our results suggest\nthat the model undergoes a nonequilibrium order-disorder phase transition even\nin the absence of the noise $q$, due to the independent behavior, but this\ntransition may be suppressed. In addition, for both topologies analyzed, we\nverified that the transition is in the same universality class of the\nequilibrium Ising model, i.e., the critical exponents are not affected by the\npresence of the second noise, associated with independence.\n", "  We develop from first principles a model to describe the average response of\nSiPM devices which takes into account the recovery of pixels during the\nincoming light pulse. Such effects can significantly affect SiPM response when\nexposed to a large number of photons.\n", "  We study the characteristic length scale of galactic halos in the\nBose-Einstein condensate (or scalar field) dark matter model. Considering the\nevolution of the density perturbation we show that the average background\nmatter density determines the quantum Jeans mass and hence the spatial size of\ngalaxies at a given epoch. In this model the minimum size of galaxies increases\nwhile the minimum mass of the galaxies decreases as the universe expands. The\nobserved values of the mass and the size of the dwarf galaxies are successfully\nreproduced with the dark matter particle mass $m\\simeq 5\\times 10^{-22}eV$. The\nminimum size is about $6\\times 10^{-3}\\sqrt{m/H}\\lambda_c$ and the typical\nrotation velocity of the dwarf galaxies is $O(\\sqrt{H/m}$) c, where $H$ is the\nHubble parameter and $\\lambda_c$ is the Compton wave length of the particle. We\nalso suggest that ultra compact dwarf galaxies are the remnants of the dwarf\ngalaxies formed in the early universe.\n", "  Several recent studies have performed galaxy decompositions to investigate\ncorrelations between the black hole mass and various properties of the host\nspheroid, but they have not converged on the same conclusions. This is because\ntheir models for the same galaxy were often significantly different and not\nconsistent with each other in terms of fitted components. Using $3.6 \\rm ~\\mu\nm$ $Spitzer$ imagery, which is a superb tracer of the stellar mass (superior to\nthe $K$-band), we have performed state-of-the-art multicomponent decompositions\nfor 66 galaxies with directly measured black hole masses. Our sample is the\nlargest to date and, unlike previous studies, contains a large number (17) of\nspiral galaxies with low black hole masses. We paid careful attention to the\nimage mosaicking, sky subtraction and masking of contaminating sources. After a\nscrupulous inspection of the galaxy photometry (through isophotal analysis and\nunsharp masking) and - for the first time - 2D kinematics, we were able to\naccount for spheroids, large-scale, intermediate-scale and nuclear disks, bars,\nrings, spiral arms, halos, extended or unresolved nuclear sources and partially\ndepleted cores. For each individual galaxy, we compared our best-fit model with\nprevious studies, explained the discrepancies and identified the optimal\ndecomposition. Moreover, we have independently performed 1D and 2D\ndecompositions, and concluded that, at least when modelling large, nearby\ngalaxies, 1D techniques have more advantages than 2D techniques. Finally, we\ndeveloped a prescription to estimate the uncertainties on the 1D best-fit\nparameters for the 66 spheroids that takes into account systematic errors,\nunlike popular 2D codes that only consider statistical errors.\n", "  We investigate the possible impact of diffusion on the abundance of helium\nand other primordial elements during formation of the first structures in the\nearly Universe. We consider the primary collapse of a perturbation and\nsubsequent accretion of matter onto the virialized halo, restricting our\nconsideration to halos with masses considerably above the Jeans limit. We find\nthat diffusion in the cold and nearly neutral primordial gas at the end of the\nDark Ages could raise the abundance of primordial elements relative to hydrogen\nin the first virialized halos: helium enrichment could reach $\\delta Y_p/Y_p\n\\sim 10^{-4}$ in the first star-forming minihalos of $ \\sim 10^5-10^6\nM_{\\odot}$. A moderate (to ~ 100 K) preheating of the primordial gas at the\nbeginning of cosmic reionization could increase this effect to $\\delta Y_p/Y_p\n\\sim 3\\times 10^{-4}$ for $\\sim 10^6 M_{\\odot}$ halos. Even stronger abundance\nenhancements, $\\delta Y_p/Y_p$ ~ a few $10^{-3}$, may arise at much later,\npost-reionization epochs, z ~ 2, in protogroups of galaxies ($\\sim 10^{13}\nM_{\\odot}$) as a result of accretion of warm-hot intergalactic medium with T ~\n10^6 K. The diffusion-induced abundance changes discussed here are small but\ncomparable to the already achieved ~ 0.1 % precision of cosmological\npredictions of the primordial He abundance. If direct helium abundance\nmeasurements (in particular, in low-metallicity HII regions in dwarf galaxies)\nachieve the same level of precision in the future, their comparison with the\nBBN predictions may require consideration of the effects discussed here.\n", "  Surface spin waves in thin Permalloy films are studied by means of\npropagative spin wave spectroscopy. We observe a systematic difference of up to\nseveral tens of MHz when comparing the frequencies of counter-propagating\nwaves. This frequency non-reciprocity effect is modeled using an analytical\ndipole-exchange theory that considers the mutual influence of non-reciprocal\nspin wave modal profiles and differences in magnetic anisotropies at the two\nfilm surfaces. At moderate film thickness (20 nm and below), the frequency\nnon-reciprocity scales linearly with the wave vector and quadratically with the\nthickness, whereas a more complex non-monotonic behavior is observed at larger\nthickness. Our work suggests that surface wave frequency non-reciprocity can be\nused as an accurate spectroscopic probe of magnetic asymmetries in thin\nferromagnetic films.\n", "  We analyze the compatibility of the recent LHC signals and the TeV-scale\nleft-right model(s) in the minimal nonsupersymmetric $SO(10)$ framework. We\nshow that the models in which the Higgs content is selected based on the\nextended survival hypothesis do not allow the $W_R$ boson to be at the\nTeV-scale. By relaxing this conjecture, we investigate various scenarios where\na number of colored-scalars, originated from various Pati-Salam multiplets, are\nlight and whence they survive down to the low energies. Performing a detailed\nrenormalization group analysis with various low-energy Higgs configurations and\nsymmetry breaking chains, while keeping the high energy Higgs content\nunmodified; we find that, among a number of possibilities, the models which\nhave a light color-triplet scalar, and its combination with a light\ncolor-sextet, particularly stand out. Although these models do allow a\nTeV-scale $W_R$ boson, generating the required value of the gauge coupling\n$g_R$ at this scale is non-trivial.\n", "  SnSe monolayer with orthorhombic Pnma GeS structure is an important\ntwo-dimensional (2D) indirect band gap material at room temperature. Based on\nfirst-principles density functional theory calculations, we present systematic\nstudies on the electronic and magnetic properties of X (X = Ga, In, As, Sb)\natoms doped SnSe monolayer. The calculated electronic structures show that\nGa-doped system maintains semiconducting property while In-doped SnSe monolayer\nis half-metal. The As- and Sb- doped SnSe systems present the characteristics\nof n-type semiconductor. Moreover, all considered substitutional doping cases\ninduce magnetic ground states with the magnetic moment of 1{\\mu}B. In addition,\nthe calculated formation energies also show that four types of doped systems\nare thermodynamic stable. These results provide a new route for the potential\napplications of doped SnSe monolayer in 2D photoelectronic and magnetic\nsemiconductor devices.\n", "  We revisit the problem of quantum localization of many-body states in a\nquantum dot and the associated problem of relaxation of an excited state in a\nfinite correlated electron system. We determine the localization threshold for\nthe eigenstates in Fock space. We argue that the localization-delocalization\ntransition (which manifests itself, e.g., in the statistics of many-body energy\nlevels) becomes sharp in the limit of a large dimensionless conductance (or,\nequivalently, in the limit of weak interaction). We also analyze the temporal\nrelaxation of quantum states of various types (a \"hot-electron state\", a\n\"typical\" many-body state, and a single-electron excitation added to a \"thermal\nstate\") with energies below, at, and above the transition.\n", "  In the present work we constrain three different profiles of a\nLema\\^itre-Tolman-Bondi model using supernovae type Ia and baryon acoustic\noscillation data. We improve common practice in the literature by carefully\ncalibrating the supernovae in the appropriate inhomogeneous background\ndynamics. In addition, we address subtle issues in order to propagate the\nprimordial BAO scale to present epoch. The combined analysis of BAO+SNIa offers\na stringent test for these models. We use two distinct parameter estimation\napproaches, namely, the $\\chi^2$ and the complete likelihood functional. It has\nbeen argued that these two approaches are not equivalent and indeed our\nanalysis shows a specific example of their departure.\n", "  We compute the exact partition function on the branched two-sphere by the\nlocalization technique. It is found that it does not depend on a branching\nparameter q, which means that supersymmetric R\\'enyi entropy defined by\nutilizing it is equivalent to the usual entanglement entropy. We also provide\nthe interpretation of the conical singularities on the branched sphere as\ndefects sit on the poles of the nonsingular two-sphere.\n", "  We study the correlation between an impurity and a small ensemble of bosonic\nparticles in one dimension. Our study analyzes the one-body density matrix and\ncalculates the corresponding von Neumann entanglement entropy as a function of\nthe interaction strength between the impurity and the bosons when all particles\nhave the same mass. We show that the entropy grows very fast for small and\nmoderate interaction strength and then increases slowly toward the strongly\ninteracting regime. Then we study the effect over the quantum correlations of a\nmass imbalance between the impurity and the bosons. In the strongly interacting\ncase, we discover that when the impurity is much heavier than the bosons, then\nwe have the least possible correlation. However, the entropy tops its maximum\nwhen the mass ratio is between 3 and 4 in the case where there are four bosonic\nparticles and then falls off to its minimum for higher mass imbalance.\n", "  We investigate quantum radiation reaction in laser-electron interactions\nacross different energy and intensity regimes. Using a fully quantum approach\nwhich also accounts exactly for the effect of the strong laser pulse on the\nelectron motion, we identify in particular a regime in which radiation reaction\nis dominated by quantum interference. We find signatures of quantum radiation\nreaction in the electron spectra which have no classical analogue and which\ncannot be captured by the incoherent approximations typically used in the\nhigh-intensity regime. These signatures are measurable with presently available\nlaser and accelerator technology.\n", "  We study the validity of the Newtonian description of cosmological\nperturbations using the Lemaitre model, an exact spherically symmetric solution\nof Einstein's equation. This problem has been investigated in the past for the\ncase of a dust fluid. Here, we extend the previous analysis to the more general\ncase of a fluid with non-negligible pressure, and, for the numerical examples,\nwe consider the case of radiation (P=\\rho/3). We find that, even when the\ndensity contrast has a nonlinear amplitude, the Newtonian description of the\ncosmological perturbations using the gravitational potential \\psi and the\ncurvature potential \\phi is valid as long as we consider sub-horizon\ninhomogeneities. However, the relation \\psi+\\phi={\\cal O}(\\phi^2), which holds\nfor the case of a dust fluid, is not valid for a relativistic fluid and\neffective anisotropic stress is generated. This demonstrates the usefulness of\nthe Lemaitre model which allows us to study in an exact nonlinear fashion the\nonset of anisotropic stress in fluids with non-negligible pressure. We show\nthat this happens when the characteristic scale of the inhomogeneity is smaller\nthan the sound horizon and that the deviation is caused by the nonlinear effect\nof the fluid's fast motion. We also find that \\psi+\\phi= \\max[{\\cal\nO}(\\phi^2),{\\cal O}(c_s^2\\phi \\, \\delta)] for an inhomogeneity with density\ncontrast \\delta whose characteristic scale is smaller than the sound horizon,\nunless w is close to -1, where w and c_s are the equation of state parameter\nand the sound speed of the fluid, respectively. On the other hand, we expect\n\\psi+\\phi={\\cal O}(\\phi^2) to hold for an inhomogeneity whose characteristic\nscale is larger than the sound horizon, unless the amplitude of the\ninhomogeneity is large and w is close to -1.\n", "  By performing numerical simulations, we discuss the collisional dynamics of\nstable solitary waves in the Schrodinger-Poisson equation. In the framework of\na model in which part or all of dark matter is a Bose-Einstein condensate of\nultralight axions, we show that these dynamics can naturally account for the\nrelative displacement between dark and ordinary matter in the galactic cluster\nAbell 3827, whose recent observation is the first empirical evidence of dark\nmatter interactions beyond gravity. The essential assumption is the existence\nof solitonic galactic cores in the kiloparsec scale. For this reason, we\npresent simulations with a benchmark value of the axion mass $m_a = 2 \\times\n10^{-24}$ eV, which is somewhat lower than the one preferred for cosmological\nstructure formation if the field is all of dark matter ($m_a \\approx\n10^{-22}$eV). We argue that future observations might bear out or falsify this\ncoherent wave interpretation of dark matter offsets.\n", "  Alkali-doped fullerides (A3C60 with A=K, Rb, Cs) show a surprising phase\ndiagram, in which a high transition-temperature (Tc) s-wave superconducting\nstate emerges next to a Mott insulating phase as a function of the lattice\nspacing. This is in contrast with the common belief that Mott physics and\nphonon-driven s-wave superconductivity are incompatible, raising a fundamental\nquestion on the mechanism of the high-Tc superconductivity. This article\nreviews recent ab initio calculations, which have succeeded in reproducing\ncomprehensively the experimental phase diagram with high accuracy and\nelucidated an unusual cooperation between the electron-phonon coupling and the\nelectron-electron interactions leading to Mott localization to realize an\nunconventional s-wave superconductivity in the alkali-doped fullerides. A\ndriving force behind the exotic physics is unusual intramolecular interactions,\ncharacterized by the coexistence of a strongly repulsive Coulomb interaction\nand a small effectively negative exchange interaction. This is realized by a\nsubtle energy balance between the coupling with the Jahn-Teller phonons and\nHund's coupling within the C60 molecule. The unusual form of the interaction\nleads to a formation of pairs of up- and down-spin electrons on the molecules,\nwhich enables the s-wave pairing. The emergent superconductivity crucially\nrelies on the presence of the Jahn-Teller phonons, but surprisingly benefits\nfrom the strong correlations because the correlations suppress the kinetic\nenergy of the electrons and help the formation of the electron pairs, in\nagreement with previous model calculations. This confirms that the alkali-doped\nfullerides are a new type of unconventional superconductors, where the unusual\nsynergy between the phonons and Coulomb interactions drives the high-Tc\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  A search is performed for the production of high-mass resonances decaying\ninto a photon and a jet in 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ of proton--proton collisions at a\ncentre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at\nthe Large Hadron Collider. Selected events have an isolated photon and a jet,\neach with transverse momentum above 150 GeV. No significant deviation of the\n$\\gamma+$jet invariant mass distribution from the background-only hypothesis is\nfound. Limits are set at 95% confidence level on the cross sections of generic\nGaussian-shaped signals and of a few benchmark phenomena beyond the Standard\nModel: excited quarks with vector-like couplings to the Standard Model\nparticles, and non-thermal quantum black holes in two models of extra spatial\ndimensions. The minimum excluded visible cross sections for Gaussian-shaped\nresonances with width-to-mass ratios of 2% decrease from about 6 fb for a mass\nof 1.5 TeV to about 0.8 fb for a mass of 5 TeV. The minimum excluded visible\ncross sections for Gaussian-shaped resonances with width-to-mass ratios of 15%\ndecrease from about 50 fb for a mass of 1.5 TeV to about 1.0 fb for a mass of 5\nTeV. Excited quarks are excluded below masses of 4.4 TeV, and non-thermal\nquantum black holes are excluded below masses of 3.8 (6.2) TeV for\nRandall--Sundrum (Arkani-Hamed--Dimopoulous--Dvali) models with one (six) extra\ndimensions.\n", "  We present a study on the dependence of electric breakdown discharge\nproperties on electrode geometry and the breakdown field in liquid argon near\nits boiling point. The measurements were performed with a spherical cathode and\na planar anode at distances ranging from 0.1 mm to 10.0 mm. A detailed study of\nthe time evolution of the breakdown volt-ampere characteristics was performed\nfor the first time. It revealed a slow streamer development phase in the\ndischarge. The results of a spectroscopic study of the visible light emission\nof the breakdowns complement the measurements. The light emission from the\ninitial phase of the discharge is attributed to electro-luminescence of liquid\nargon following a current of drifting electrons. These results contribute to\nset benchmarks for breakdown-safe design of ionization detectors, such as\nLiquid Argon Time Projection Chambers (LAr TPC).\n", "  In two dimensions the Fourier transform of the interaction between two point\ndipoles has a term which grows linearly in the modulus $| \\mathbf{\\textit{q}}\n|$ of the momentum . As a consequence, in second order perturbation theory the\nself-energy of two-dimensional dipolar fermions is ultraviolet divergent. We\nshow that for electric dipoles this divergence can be avoided if one takes into\naccount that physical dipoles consist of two opposite charges which are\nseparated by a finite distance. Using this regularization, we calculate the\nself-energy, the renormalized chemical potential, and the renormalized Fermi\nsurface of dipolar fermions in two dimensions in second order perturbation\ntheory. We find that in the Fermi liquid phase the second order corrections\nweaken first order effects.\n", "  Black phosphorus (BP) has emerged as a direct-bandgap semiconducting material\nwith great application potentials in electronics, photonics, and energy\nconversion. Experimental characterization of the anisotropic thermal properties\nof BP, however, is extremely challenging due to the lack of reliable and\naccurate measurement techniques to characterize anisotropic samples that are\nmicrometers in size. Here, we report measurement results of the anisotropic\nthermal conductivity of bulk BP along three primary crystalline orientations,\nusing the novel time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect (TR-MOKE) with\nenhanced measurement sensitivities. Two-dimensional beam-offset TR-MOKE signals\nfrom BP flakes yield the thermal conductivity along the zigzag crystalline\ndirection to be 84 ~ 101 W/(m*K), nearly three times as large as that along the\narmchair direction (26 ~ 36 W/(m*K)). The through-plane thermal conductivity of\nBP ranges from 4.3 to 5.5 W/(m*K). The first-principles calculation was\nperformed for the first time to predict the phonon transport in BP both along\nthe in-plane zigzag and armchair directions and along the through-plane\ndirection. This work successfully unveiled the fundamental mechanisms of\nanisotropic thermal transport along the three crystalline directions in bulk\nBP, as demonstrated by the excellent agreement between our\nfirst-principles-based theoretical predictions and experimental\ncharacterizations on the anisotropic thermal conductivities of bulk BP.\n", "  We study angular observables in the $e^+e^-\\to Z H\\to \\ell^+\n\\ell^-\\,b\\bar{b}$ channel at future circular $e^+ e^-$ colliders such as CEPC\nand FCC-ee. Taking into account the impact of realistic cut acceptance and\ndetector effects, we forecast the precision of six angular asymmetries at CEPC\n(FCC-ee) with center-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s} =$ 240 GeV and 5 (30) ${\\rm\nab}^{-1}$ integrated luminosity. We then determine the projected sensitivity to\na range of operators relevant for the Higgs-strahlung process in the\ndimension-6 Higgs EFT. Our results show that angular observables provide\ncomplementary sensitivity to rate measurements when constraining various tensor\nstructures arising from new physics. We further find that angular asymmetries\nprovide a novel means of both probing BSM corrections to the $H Z \\gamma$\ncoupling and constraining the \"blind spot\" in indirect limits on supersymmetric\nscalar top partners.\n", "  Electrostatic repulsions can drive crystallization in many-particle systems.\nFor charged colloidal systems, the phase boundaries as well as crystal\nstructure are highly tunable by experimental parameters such as salt\nconcentration and pH. By using projections of the colloid-ion mixture to a\nsystem of (soft) repulsive spheres and the one-component plasma (OCP), we study\nthe hitherto unexplained experimentally observed reentrant melting of\nelectrostatically repelling colloids upon increasing the colloid density. Our\nstudy shows that the surface chemistry should involve a competition between\nadsorption of cations and anions to explain the observed density-induced\nreentrant melting.\n", "  In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the\nthermodynamics, structure and dynamics of the Li$_2$CO$_3$-K$_2$CO$_3$ (62:38\nmol%) eutectic mixture. We present a new classical non-polarizable force field\nfor this molten salt mixture, optimized using experimental and first principles\nmolecular dynamics simulations as reference data. This simple force field\nallows efficient molecular simulations of phenomena at long timescales. We use\nthis optimized force field to describe the behavior of the eutectic mixture in\nthe 900-1100 K temperature range, at pressures between 0 and 5 GPa. After\nstudying the equation of state in these thermodynamic conditions, we present\nmolecular insight into the structure and dynamics of the melt. In particular,\nwe present an analysis of the temperature and pressure dependence of the\neutectic mixture's self diffusion coefficients, viscosity and ionic\nconductivity.\n", "  We study the mean-field BCS-BEC evolution of a uniform Fermi gas on a\nsingle-band triangular lattice, and construct its ground-state phase diagrams,\nshowing a wealth of topological quantum phase transitions between gapped and\ngapless superfluids that are induced by the interplay of an out-of-plane Zeeman\nfield and a generic non-Abelian gauge field.\n", "  Observable states are gauge-invariant. In a non-Abelian gauge theory, these\nare necessarily composite operators. We investigate the spectrum of these\noperators in the two-Higgs-doublet model. For this purpose, we are working\nalong the lines of the Fr\\\"ohlich-Morchio-Strocchi mechanism to relate the\nphysical spectrum to the spectrum of the elementary particles. We also\ninvestigate the consequences of spontaneous breaking of the global (custodial)\nsymmetry group. Finally, we briefly comment on how to test the results using\nlattice methods.\n", "  We propose to interpret the possible resonance seen in di-photons at the LHC\nat 750 Gev as a bound state of a new pair of heavy gluons associated with an\nenhanced color gauge invariance. These have a conservation law which enforces\ntheir production and decay in pairs and hence requires that the leading\ncoupling to quarks is quadratically through a dimension 5 operator. One way to\nrealize these hypotheses is if the SU(3) color gauge invariance is enhanced to\nSL(3, C), while at the same time promoting the internal metric, which picks out\nwhat is a unitary transformation, to a dynamical degree of freedom. This theory\nwas first proposed by Cahill[3], Dell[4], Kim and Zee[5], and Julia and\nLuciani[6]. The dynamical internal metric spontaneously breaks SL(3,C) to SU(3)\ngiving a mass to the vector bosons associated with the generators in\nSL(3,C)/SU(3). The coupling to the internal metric also ensures that the energy\nis bounded from below. The new state is produced by gluon fusion and decays to\na pair of photons via a direct coupling to a new set of vector quarks allowed\nby the symmetries.\n", "  In the last decade, the study of the overall shape of the universe, called\nCosmic Topology, has become testable by astronomical observations, especially\nthe data from the Cosmic Microwave Background (hereafter CMB) obtained by WMAP\nand Planck telescopes. Cosmic Topology involves both global topological\nfeatures and more local geometrical properties such as curvature. It deals with\nquestions such as whether space is finite or infinite, simply-connected or\nmulti-connected, and smaller or greater than its observable counterpart. A\nstriking feature of some relativistic, multi-connected small universe models is\nto create multiples images of faraway cosmic sources. While the last CMB\n(Planck) data fit well the simplest model of a zero-curvature, infinite space\nmodel, they remain consistent with more complex shapes such as the spherical\nPoincare Dodecahedral Space, the flat hypertorus or the hyperbolic Picard horn.\nWe review the theoretical and observational status of the field.\n", "  New analysis methods for the vibrational dynamics from molecular dynamics are\nproposed and applied to liquid H$_{2}$O. The internal modes of H$_{2}$O are\namplitude-modulated by Langevin dynamics with the frequency of the H$_{2}$O\nlibration (~600 cm$^{-1}$) and its first overtone (~1200 cm$^{-1}$). The\ncarrier signal is frequency-modulated by the variation of the hydrogen bond\nstrength due to thermal motion and by dephasing collisions. The standard power\nspectra of the bond parameters yield broadened normal modes due to a\nsuperposition of several perturbations. Here, the oscillating bond lengths and\nangles are demodulated by the spline interpolation of the minima or maxima.\nAdditionally, a zero-crossing method is described, which yields the spectrum of\nthe frequency modulated carrier without Fourier transform by directly\nconverting the oscillation periods.\n", "  Fluorescent latex beads have been widely used as tracers in microfluidics\nover for the last decades. They have the advantages to be density matched with\nwater and to be easily localizable using fluorescence microscopy. We have\nrecently synthesized silver-coated oil droplets that are both luminescent and\nabsorptive, by first coating the oil interface with a polydopamine layer and\nthen depositing a silver layer by a redox process. They have a mean diameter of\n6 \\mu m and a their density has been matched to the density of water by\nadjusting the thickness of the metallic layer. In this work we used these\nparticles as tracers to measure the velocity profile of a water flow in a PDMS\nmicrochannel with a rectangular cross-section, which allowed us to confirm the\npredictions of the Stokes equation with results comparable to those of common\nsubmicronic polystyrene particles.\n", "  Metric anomalies arising from a distribution of point defects (intrinsic\ninterstitials, vacancies, point stacking faults), thermal deformation,\nbiological growth, etc. are well known sources of material inhomogeneity and\ninternal stress. By emphasizing the geometric nature of such anomalies we seek\ntheir representations for materially uniform crystalline elastic solids. In\nparticular, we introduce a quasi-plastic deformation framework where the\nmultiplicative decomposition of the total deformation gradient into an elastic\nand a plastic deformation is established such that the plastic deformation is\nfurther decomposed multiplicatively in terms of a deformation due to\ndislocations and another due to metric anomalies. We discuss our work in the\ncontext of quasi-plastic strain formulation and Weyl geometry. We also derive a\ngeneral form of metric anomalies which yield a zero stress field in the absence\nof other inhomogeneities and any external sources of stress.\n", "  In this paper we employ numerical methods to study the Einstein equation \\[\nRic(g)=\\lambda\\, g, \\] where $Ric$ is the Ricci tensor and $\\lambda$ is the\nEinstein constant, restricted to a class of full flag manifolds. These metrics\ndescribe the gravitational field of a vacuum with cosmological constant (vacuum\nis the case $\\lambda=0$). In particular, we give estimates to the number of\nsuch metrics on the full flag manifolds $SU(n+1)/T^n$ for $n=4,5$, improving\nsome classical estimatives. We also examine the isometric problem for these\nEinstein metrics. Our method can be applied for any fixed $n$.\n", "  We report a unique experimental approach to create topological\nsuperconductors by inducing superconductivity into epitaxial metallic thin film\nwith strong spin-orbit coupling. Utilizing molecular beam epitaxy technique\nunder ultra-high vacuum condition, we are able to achieve (111) oriented single\nphase of gold (Au) thin film grown on a well-oriented vanadium (V) s-wave\nsuperconductor film with clean interface. We obtained atomically smooth Au thin\nfilms with thicknesses even down to below a nanometer showing near-ideal\nsurface quality. The as-grown V/Au bilayer heterostructure exhibits\nsuperconducting transition at around 4 K. Clear Josephson tunneling and Andreev\nreflection are observed in S-I-S tunnel junctions fabricated from the epitaxial\nbi-layers. The barrier thickness dependent tunneling and the associated\nsubharmonic gap structures (SGS) confirmed the induced superconductivity in Au\n(111), paving the way for engineering thin film heterostructure based p-wave\nsuperconductors and nano devices for Majorana fermion.\n", "  The coherent cross section of $J/\\psi$, $\\rho$, $\\phi$ are computed in dipole\nmodel in the ultraperipheral PbPb collisions, the IP-Sat and IIM model are\napplied in the calculation of the differential cross section of the dipole\nscattering off the nucleon, three kinds of forward vector meson wave functions\nare used in the overlap. The prediction of $J/\\psi$ and $\\rho$ is compared with\nthe experimental data of the ALICE Collaboration, and the prediction of $\\phi$\nis also given in this paper.\n", "  We investigate optical reprocessing of X-rays in the LMXB pulsar 4U 1626-67\nin its current spin-up phase using observations with Southern African Large\nTelescope (SALT), near-simultaneous observations with Swift-XRT and\nnon-simultaneous RXTE-PCA observations and present the results of timing\nanalysis. Using SALT observations carried out on 5th and 6th March, 2014, we\ndetect some interesting reprocessing signatures. We detect a weak optical Quasi\nPeriodic Oscillation (QPO) in the power density spectrum on March 5th at 48 mHz\nwith a fractional rms of 3.3% in spite of the fact that source shows no\ncorresponding X-ray QPO in the spin-up phase. In the light curve obtained on\nMarch 5th, we detect a coherent pulsation at the spin period of ~7.677 s. A\npreviously known, slightly down-shifted side-band is also detected at 129.92\nmHz. The frequency spacing between main pulse and this side-band is different\nfrom earlier observations, though the statistical significance of the\ndifference is limited. The light curve of 6th March displays short time-scale\nvariability in the form of flares on timescales of a few minutes. Folded pulse\nprofiles resulting from data of this night show an interesting trend of pulse\npeak drifting. This drift could be due to i) rapid changes in the reprocessing\nagent, like orbital motion of an accretion disk warp around the neutron star or\nii) intrinsic pulse phase changes in X-rays. We also examine some X-ray light\ncurves obtained with RXTE-PCA during 2008-2010 for pulse shape changes in short\ntime scales during X-ray flares.\n", "  Within the Bethe-Salpeter formalism for instantaneous interactions, we\ndescribe, along a totally analytic route, the lightest pseudoscalar mesons by\nquark-antiquark bound states which show at least three indispensable general\nfeatures, namely, the (almost) masslessness required for pions and kaons to be\ninterpretable as (pseudo) Goldstone bosons, the suitable asymptotic behaviour\nin the limit of large spacelike relative momenta as determined by the\nrelationship between quark mass function and Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes, and a\npointwise behaviour for finite spacelike relative momenta suited for\nguaranteeing colour confinement.\n", "  Observationally, weak lensing has been served so far by optical surveys due\nto the much larger number densities of background galaxies achieved, which is\ntypically by two to three orders of magnitude compared to radio. However, the\nhigh sensitivity of the new generation of radio telescopes such as the Square\nKilometre Array (SKA) will provide a density of detected galaxies that is\ncomparable to that found at optical wavelengths, and with significant source\nshape measurements to make large area radio surveys competitive for weak\nlensing studies. This will lead weak lensing to become one of the primary\nscience drivers in radio surveys too, with the advantage that they will access\nthe largest scales in the Universe going beyond optical surveys, like LSST and\nEuclid, in terms of redshifts that are probed. RadioLensfit is an adaptation to\nradio data of \"lensfit\", a model-fitting approach for galaxy shear measurement,\noriginally developed for optical weak lensing surveys. Its key advantage is\nworking directly in the visibility domain, which is the natural approach to\nadopt with radio data, avoiding systematics due to the imaging process. We\npresent results on galaxy shear measurements, including investigation of\nsensitivity to instrumental parameters such as the visibilities gridding size,\nbased on simulations of individual galaxy visibilities performed by using\nSKA1-MID baseline configuration. We get an amplitude of the shear bias in the\nmethod comparable with SKA1 requirements for a population of galaxies with\nrealistic flux and scalelength distributions estimated from the VLA SWIRE\ncatalog.\n", "  Here, we experimentally generated photonic graphene by resonance of\ninhomogeneously strained one dimensional lattices of triangular solitons. Where\nmildly twisted solitons are considered as north and south monopoles, while\nstrongly twisted solitons are considered as defect north monopoles. Weak\nbounding is observed between the opposite monopoles. Strong bounding occurred\nbetween the monopoles with same polarity. Where a defect north monopole is\ntransformed into a flux-like tube. Which generated an optical analogue of the\ntorus sublattice. Bogomolny's vortice-like symmetry is remained intact in all\nthese observations. Dirac's north monopole along with the string is also\nobserved. The results presented in this paper were also described in terms of\nsupersymmetry and quantum phase transitions, and reported in ref[20].\n", "  A natural presymplectic structure for non-Lagrangian equations of motion\ngoverning the dynamics of free higher-spin fields in four-dimensional anti-de\nSitter space is proposed. This presymplectic structure is then used to the\nderivation of the conserved currents associated with the relativistic\ninvariance and to the construction of local functionals of fields that are\ngauge invariant on shell.\n", "  Below an accretion rate of approximately a few per cent of the Eddington\naccretion rate, X-ray binary systems are not usually found in the soft spectral\nstate. However, at accretion rates a factor of a few lower still, in the hard\nstate, there is another spectral transition which is well observed but not well\nunderstood. Below ~0.5-1 per cent of the Eddington accretion rate (m_crit), the\nspectral index hardens with increasing accretion rate, but above m_crit,\nalthough still in the hard state, the spectral index softens with increasing\naccretion rate. Here we use a combination of X-ray spectral fitting and a study\nof short time-scale spectral variability to examine the behaviour of three\nwell-known X-ray binaries: Cygnus X-1, GX 339-4 and XTE J1118+480.\n  In Cygnus X-1 we find separate hard and soft continuum components, and show\nusing root-mean-square (rms) spectra that the soft component dominates the\nvariability. The spectral transition at m_crit is clearly present in the\nhard-state hardness-intensity diagrams of Cygnus X-1. Above m_crit, GX 339-4\nshows similar softer-when-brighter behaviour at both long and short\ntime-scales. Similarly, XTE J1118+480, which remains well below m_crit, is\nharder-when-brighter behaviour on all time-scales.\n  We interpret these results in terms of two continuum components: a hard\npower-law which dominates the spectra when the accretion rate is low, probably\narising from Comptonisation of cyclo-synchrotron photons from the corona, and a\nsoft power-law which dominates at higher accretion rates, arising from\nComptonisation of seed photons from the accretion disc.\n", "  We determine the linear optical susceptibility of a radiation pulse\npropagating through a mixture of a gas of atoms or molecules and a plasma. For\na specific range of radiation and plasma frequencies, resonant generation of\nvolume plasmons significantly amplifies the radiation intensity. The conditions\nfor resonant amplification are derived from the dispersion relations in the\nmixture, and the amplification is demonstrated in a numerical simulation of\npulse propagation.\n", "  I give a critical review of the holographic hypothesis, which posits that a\nuniverse with gravity can be described by a quantum field theory in fewer\ndimensions. I first recall how the idea originated from considerations on black\nhole thermodynamics and the so-called information paradox that arises when\nHawking radiation is taken into account. String Quantum Gravity tried to solve\nthe puzzle using the AdS/CFT correspondence, according to which a black hole in\na 5-D anti-de Sitter space is like a flat 4-D field of particles and radiation.\nAlthough such an interesting holographic property, also called gauge/gravity\nduality, has never been proved rigorously, it has impulsed a number of research\nprograms in fields as diverse as nuclear physics, condensed matter physics,\ngeneral relativity and cosmology. I finally discuss the pros and cons of the\nholographic conjecture, and emphasizes the key role played by black holes for\nunderstanding quantum gravity and possible dualities between distant fields of\ntheoretical physics.\n", "  The azimuthal and magnetic quantum numbers of spherical harmonics\n$Y_{l}^{m}(\\theta,\\phi)$ describe quantization corresponding to the magnitude\nand $z$-component of angular momentum operator in the framework of realization\nof $su(2)$ Lie algebra symmetry. The azimuthal quantum number $l$ allocates to\nitself an additional ladder symmetry by the operators which are written in\nterms of $l$. Here, it is shown that simultaneous realization of the both\nsymmetries inherits the positive and negative $(l-m)$- and $(l+m)$-integer\ndiscrete irreducible representations for $su(1,1)$ Lie algebra via the\nspherical harmonics on the sphere as a compact manifold. So, in addition to\nrealizing the unitary irreducible representation of $su(2)$ compact Lie algebra\nvia the $Y_{l}^{m}(\\theta,\\phi)$'s for a given $l$, we can also represent\n$su(1,1)$ noncompact Lie algebra by spherical harmonics for given values of\n$l-m$ and $l+m$.\n", "  We investigate the effect of the filling factor on transport anisotropies,\nknown as stripes, in high Landau levels of a two-dimensional electron gas. We\nfind that at certain in-plane magnetic fields, the stripes orientation is\nsensitive to the filling factor within a given Landau level. This sensitivity\ngives rise to the emergence of stripes away from half-filling while an\northogonally-oriented, native stripes reside at half-filling. This switching of\nthe anisotropy axes within a single Landau level can be attributed to a strong\ndependence of the native symmetry breaking potential on the filling factor.\n", "  The temperature dependence of microwave-induced resistance oscillations\n(MIRO), according to the theory, originates from electron-electron scattering.\nThis scattering affects both the quantum lifetime, or the density of states,\nand the inelastic lifetime, which governs the relaxation of the nonequilibrium\ndistribution function. Here, we report on MIRO in an ultrahigh mobility ($\\mu >\n3 \\times 10^7$ cm$^2$/Vs) 2D electron gas at $T$ between $0.3$ K and $1.8$ K.\nIn contrast to theoretical predictions, the quantum lifetime is found to be\n$T$-independent in the whole temperature range studied. At the same time, the\n$T$-dependence of the inelastic lifetime is much \\emph{stronger} than can be\nexpected from electron-electron interactions.\n", "  We report on a strain-induced martensitic transformation, accompanied by a\nsuppression of magnetic order in epitaxial films of chemically disordered FeRh.\nX-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and electronic structure\ncalculations reveal that the lowering of symmetry (from cubic to tetragonal)\nimposed by the epitaxial relation leads to a further, unexpected,\ntetragonal-to-orthorhombic transition, triggered by a band-Jahn-Teller-type\nlattice instability. The collapse of magnetic order is a direct consequence of\nthis structural change, which upsets the subtle balance between ferromagnetic\nnearest-neighbor interactions arising from Fe-Rh hybridization and frustrated\nantiferromagnetic coupling among localized Fe moments at larger distances.\n", "  MnP, a superconductor under pressure, exhibits a ferromagnetic order below\nTC~290 K followed by a helical order with the spins lying in the ab plane and\nthe helical rotation propagating along the c axis below Ts~50 K at ambient\npressure. We performed single crystal neutron diffraction experiments to\ndetermine the magnetic ground states under pressure. Both TC and Ts are\ngradually suppressed with increasing pressure and the helical order disappears\nat ~1.2 GPa. At intermediate pressures of 1.8 and 2.0 GPa, the ferromagnetic\norder first develops and changes to a conical or two-phase (ferromagnetic and\nhelical) structure with the propagation along the b axis below a characteristic\ntemperature. At 3.8 GPa, a helical magnetic order appears below 208 K, which\nhosts the spins in the ac plane and the propagation along the b axis. The\nperiod of this b axis modulation is shorter than that at 1.8 GPa. Our results\nindicate that the magnetic phase in the vicinity of the superconducting phase\nmay have a helical magnetic correlation along the b axis.\n", "  We present Hubble WFC3/IR slitless grism spectra of a remarkably bright\n$z\\gtrsim10$ galaxy candidate, GN-z11, identified initially from\nCANDELS/GOODS-N imaging data. A significant spectroscopic continuum break is\ndetected at $\\lambda=1.47\\pm0.01~\\mu$m. The new grism data, combined with the\nphotometric data, rule out all plausible lower redshift solutions for this\nsource. The only viable solution is that this continuum break is the Ly$\\alpha$\nbreak redshifted to ${z_\\mathrm{grism}=11.09^{+0.08}_{-0.12}}$, just $\\sim$400\nMyr after the Big Bang. This observation extends the current spectroscopic\nfrontier by 150 Myr to well before the Planck (instantaneous) cosmic\nreionization peak at z~8.8, demonstrating that galaxy build-up was well\nunderway early in the reionization epoch at z>10. GN-z11 is remarkably and\nunexpectedly luminous for a galaxy at such an early time: its UV luminosity is\n3x larger than L* measured at z~6-8. The Spitzer IRAC detections up to 4.5\n$\\mu$m of this galaxy are consistent with a stellar mass of\n${\\sim10^{9}~M_\\odot}$. This spectroscopic redshift measurement suggests that\nthe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be able to similarly and easily\nconfirm such sources at z>10 and characterize their physical properties through\ndetailed spectroscopy. Furthermore, WFIRST, with its wide-field near-IR\nimaging, would find large numbers of similar galaxies and contribute greatly to\nJWST's spectroscopy, if it is launched early enough to overlap with JWST.\n", "  Astronomy is undergoing through a methodological revolution triggered by an\nunprecedented wealth of complex and accurate data. DAMEWARE (DAta Mining &\nExploration Web Application and REsource) is a general purpose, Web-based,\nVirtual Observatory compliant, distributed data mining framework specialized in\nmassive data sets exploration with machine learning methods. We present the\nDAMEWARE (DAta Mining & Exploration Web Application REsource) which allows the\nscientific community to perform data mining and exploratory experiments on\nmassive data sets, by using a simple web browser. DAMEWARE offers several tools\nwhich can be seen as working environments where to choose data analysis\nfunctionalities such as clustering, classification, regression, feature\nextraction etc., together with models and algorithms.\n", "  It is widely accepted that a quasi-steady-state flux of minor bodies moving\nin and out of the co-orbital state with the Earth may exist. Some of these\nobjects are very good candidates for future in situ study due to their\nfavourable dynamical properties. In this paper, we show that the recently\ndiscovered near-Earth asteroids 2015 XX169, 2015 YA and 2015 YQ1 are small\ntransient Earth co-orbitals. These new findings increase the tally of known\nEarth co-orbitals to 17. The three of them currently exhibit asymmetric\nhorseshoe behaviour subjected to a Kozai resonance and their short-term orbital\nevolution is rather unstable. Both 2015 YA and 2015 YQ1 may leave Earth's\nco-orbital zone in the near future as they experience close encounters with\nVenus, the Earth-Moon system and Mars. Asteroid 2015 XX169 may have remained in\nthe vicinity of, or trapped inside, the 1:1 mean motion resonance with our\nplanet for many thousands of years and may continue in that region for a\nsignificant amount of time into the future.\n", "  A didactic and systematic derivation of Noether point symmetries and\nconserved currents is put forward in special relativistic field theories,\nwithout a priori assumptions about the transformation laws. Given the\nLagrangian density, the invariance condition develops as a set of partial\ndifferential equations determining the symmetry transformation. The solution is\nprovided in the case of real scalar, complex scalar, free electromagnetic, and\ncharged electromagnetic fields. Besides the usual conservation laws, a less\npopular symmetry is analyzed: the symmetry associated with the linear\nsuperposition of solutions, whenever applicable. The role of gauge invariance\nis emphasized. The case of the charged scalar particle under external\nelectromagnetic fields is considered, and the accompanying Noether point\nsymmetries determined.\n", "  This paper presents formulae for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) entanglement\ngenerated from $N$ nondegenerate optical parametric amplifiers (NOPAs)\ninterconnected in a linear coherent feedback (CFB) chain in the idealized\nlossless scenario and infinite bandwidth limit. The lossless scenario sets the\nultimate EPR entanglement (two-mode squeezing) that can be achieved by this\nlinear chain of NOPAs while the infinite bandwidth limit simplifies the\nanalysis but gives an accurate approximation to the EPR entanglement at low\nfrequencies of interest. Two adjustable phase shifts are placed at the outputs\nof the system to achieve the best EPR entanglement by selecting appropriate\nquadratures of the output fields.\n", "  Majorana zero modes are quasiparticle excitations in condensed matter systems\nthat have been proposed as building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computers\n[1]. They are expected to exhibit non-Abelian particle statistics, in contrast\nto the usual statistics of fermions and bosons, enabling quantum operations to\nbe performed by braiding isolated modes around one another. Quantum braiding\noperations are topologically protected insofar as these modes are pinned near\nzero energy, and the pinning is predicted to be exponential as the modes become\nspatially separated. Following theoretical proposals, several experiments have\nidentified signatures of Majorana modes in proximitized nanowires and atomic\nchains, with small mode-splitting potentially explained by hybridization of\nMajoranas. Here, we use Coulomb-blockade spectroscopy in an InAs nanowire\nsegment with epitaxial aluminum, which forms a proximity-induced\nsuperconducting Coulomb island (a Majorana island) that is isolated from\nnormal-metal leads by tunnel barriers, to measure the splitting of\nnear-zero-energy Majorana modes. We observe exponential suppression of energy\nsplitting with increasing wire length. For short devices of a few hundred\nnanometers, sub-gap state energies oscillate as the magnetic field is varied,\nas is expected for hybridized Majorana modes. Splitting decreases by a factor\nof about ten for each half micrometer of increased wire length. For devices\nlonger than about one micrometer, transport in strong magnetic fields occurs\nthrough a zero-energy state that is energetically isolated from a continuum,\nyielding uniformly spaced Coulomb-blockade conductance peaks, consistent with\nteleportation via Majorana modes. Our results help explain the\ntrivial-to-topological transition in finite systems and to quantify the scaling\nof topological protection with end-mode separation.\n", "  The detection of galactic supernova (SN) neutrinos represents one of the\nfuture frontiers of low-energy neutrino physics and astrophysics. The neutron\ncoherence of neutral currents (NC) allows quite large cross sections in the\ncase of neutron rich targets, which can be exploited in detecting earth and sky\nneutrinos by measuring nuclear recoils. They are relatively cheap and easy to\nmaintain. The relevant NC cross sections are not dependent on flavor\nconversions and, thus, their measurement will provide useful information about\nthe neutrino source. In particular they will yield information about the\nprimary neutrino fluxes and perhaps about the spectrum after flavor conversions\nin neutrino sphere.They might also provide some clues about the neutrino mass\nhierarchy. The advantages of large gaseous low threshold and high resolution\ndetectors with time projection counters (TPC) are discussed.\n", "  Optically generated electron-hole plasma in high-index dielectric\nnanostructures was demonstrated as a means of tuning of their optical\nproperties. However, until now an ultrafast operation regime of such plasma\ndriven nanostructures has not been attained. Here, we perform pump-probe\nexperiments with resonant silicon nanoparticles and report on dense optical\nplasma generation near the magnetic dipole resonance with ultrafast (about 2.5\nps) relaxation rate. Basing on experimental results, we develop an analytical\nmodel describing transient response of a nanocrystalline silicon nanoparticle\nto an intense laser pulse and show theoretically that plasma induced optical\nnonlinearity leads to ultrafast reconfiguration of the scattering power\npattern. We demonstrate 100 fs switching to unidirectional scattering regime\nupon irradiation of the nanoparticle by an intense femtosecond pulse. Our work\nlays the foundation for developing ultracompact and ultrafast all-optical\nsignal processing devices.\n", "  We study the instability of the superconducting state in a mesoscopic\ngeometry for the low pinning material Mo$_3$Ge characterized by a large\nGinzburg-Landau parameter. We observe that in the current driven switching to\nthe normal state from a nonlinear region of the Abrikosov flux flow, the mean\ncritical vortex velocity reaches a limiting maximum velocity as a function of\nthe applied magnetic field. Based on time dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations\nwe argue that the observed behavior is due to the high velocity vortex dynamics\nconfined on a mesoscopic scale. We build up a general phase diagram which\nincludes all possible dynamic configurations of Abrikosov lattice in a\nmesoscopic superconductor.\n", "  We comprehensively investigate the nontrivial states of interacting Bose\nsystem in one-dimensional optical superlattices under the open boundary\ncondition. Our results show that there exists a kind of stable localized\nstates: edge gap solitons. We argue that the states originate from the\neigenstates of independent edge parabolas. In particular, the edge gap solitons\nexhibit a nonzero topological invariant. The topological nature is due to the\nconnection of the present model to the quantized adiabatic particle transport\nproblem. In addition, the composition relations between the gap solitons and\nthe extend states under the open boundary condition are discussed.\n", "  The coupling of the Higgs to second generation particles can be studied by\nmeasuring the decay of the Higgs boson to two muons. In this analysis we\nconsidered the process at a centre of mass energy of 1 TeV, where the WW-fusion\nprocess is dominant and the Higgsstrahlung can be neglected. We assumed an\nintegrated luminosity of 500 fb-1 and a beam polarization of (Pe- Pe+) =\n(-0.8,+0.2). We estimated the sensitivity of the Higgs coupling to muons using\nfull simulation of the ILD detector described in the DBD. We developed a new\nselection for the two muons based on the latest available particle ID tools.\nThis improved the sensitivity by more than 10%. A further 10% gains was\nachieved by exploiting multi variate techniques. Combining the two improvements\nwe reached a sensitivity of 2.7, a significant improvement with respect to the\nprevious estimate.\n", "  We introduce a new board game based on the ancient Chinese game of Go (Weiqi,\nIgo, Baduk). The key difference from the original game is that players no\nlonger alternatively play single stones on the board but instead they take\nturns placing pairs of entangled go stones. A phenomenon of quantum-like\ncollapse occurs when one of the stones in an entangled pair is directly in\ncontact with at least one other stone. The player to whom the entangled pair\nbelongs must then remove one of the stones in the pair from the board. The aim\nof the game is still to surround more territory than the opponent and as the\nnumber of stones increases, all the entangled pairs of stones eventually reduce\nto single stones. Quantum Go provides an interesting and tangible illustration\nof quantum concepts such as superposition, entanglement and collapse.\n", "  Room-temperature (RT) conductivity of most candidates for solid electrolytes\nof miniaturized lithium-ion batteries is still 1-2 orders of magnitude below\ncommercial requirements, therefore several approaches are being pursued aiming\nthe enhancement of such values. In this letter, we report for the first time\ndirect theoretical evidence that epitaxial strain can be an efficient tool to\nreach this goal.\n", "  The idea that decoherence in a unitary-only quantum theory suffices to\nexplain emergence of classical phenomena has been shown in the peer-reviewed\nliterature to be seriously flawed due to circularity. However, claims continue\nto be made that this approach, also known as \"Quantum Darwinism,\" is the\ncorrect way to understand classical emergence. This Letter reviews the basic\nproblem and points out an additional logical flaw in the argument. It is\nconcluded that the \"Quantum Darwinism\" program fails.\n", "  We present a new redshift survey, the 2dF Quasar Dark Energy Survey pilot\n(2QDESp), which consists of ${\\approx}10000$ quasars from ${\\approx}150$\ndeg$^2$ of the southern sky, based on VST-ATLAS imaging and 2dF/AAOmega\nspectroscopy. Combining our optical photometry with the WISE (W1,W2) bands we\ncan select essentially contamination free quasar samples with $0.8{<}z{<}2.5$\nand $g{<}20.5$. At fainter magnitudes, optical UVX selection is still required\nto reach our $g{\\approx}22.5$ limit. Using both these techniques we observed\nquasar redshifts at sky densities up to $90$ deg$^{-2}$. By comparing 2QDESp\nwith other surveys (SDSS, 2QZ and 2SLAQ) we find that quasar clustering is\napproximately luminosity independent, with results for all four surveys\nconsistent with a correlation scale of $r_{0}{=}6.1{\\pm}0.1 \\: h^{-1}$Mpc,\ndespite their decade range in luminosity. We find a significant redshift\ndependence of clustering, particularly when BOSS data with $r_{0}{=}7.3{\\pm}0.1\n\\: h^{-1}$Mpc are included at $z{\\approx}2.4$. All quasars remain consistent\nwith having a single host halo mass of ${\\approx}2{\\pm}1{\\times}10^{12} \\:\nh^{-1}M_\\odot$. This result implies that either quasars do not radiate at a\nfixed fraction of the Eddington luminosity or AGN black hole and dark matter\nhalo masses are weakly correlated. No significant evidence is found to support\nfainter, X-ray selected quasars at low redshift having larger halo masses as\npredicted by the `hot halo' mode AGN model of Fanidakis et al. 2013. Finally,\nalthough the combined quasar sample reaches an effective volume as large as\nthat of the original SDSS LRG sample, we do not detect the BAO feature in these\ndata.\n", "  Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) is a type of gaseous detector having excellent\ntime and position resolutions. VECC is involved in the R\\&D of indigenously\ndeveloped bakelite RPCs. The largest size of bakelite RPC developed in India is\n100 cm $\\times$ 100 cm. We present here the test results of a bakelite sample\nalong with the cosmic ray test results of a bakelite RPC (30 cm $\\times$ 30 cm\n$\\times$ 0.2cm) fabricated at VECC. The steps taken towards the development of\na large size (240 cm $\\times$ 120 cm $\\times$ 0.2 cm) bakelite RPC have also\nbeen discussed.\n", "  With the global view and high-cadence observations from SDO/AIA and STEREO,\nmany spatially separated solar eruptive events appear to be coupled. However,\nthe mechanisms for \"sympathetic\" events are still largely unknown. In this\nstudy, we investigate the impact of an erupting flux rope on surrounding solar\nstructures through large-scale magnetic coupling. We build a realistic\nenvironment of the solar corona on 2011 February 15 using a global\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model and initiate coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in\nactive region (AR) 11158 by inserting Gibson-Low analytical flux ropes. We show\nthat a CME's impact on the surrounding structures depends not only on the\nmagnetic strength of these structures and their distance to the source region,\nbut also on the interaction between the CME with the large-scale magnetic\nfield. Within the CME expansion domain where the flux rope field directly\ninteracts with the solar structures, expansion-induced reconnection often\nmodifies the overlying field, thereby increasing the decay index. This effect\nmay provide a primary coupling mechanism underlying the sympathetic eruptions.\nThe magnitude of the impact is found to depend on the orientation of the\nerupting flux rope, with the largest impacts occurring when the flux rope is\nfavorably oriented for reconnecting with the surrounding regions. Outside the\nCME expansion domain, the influence of the CME is mainly through field line\ncompression or post-eruption relaxation. Based on our numerical experiments, we\ndiscuss a way to quantify the eruption impact, which could be useful for\nforecasting purposes.\n", "  Recent X-ray observations of star-forming galaxies such as M82 have shown the\nLy beta/Ly alpha line ratio of Ne X to be in excess of predictions for thermal\nelectron impact excitation. Here we demonstrate that the observed line ratio\nmay be due to charge exchange and can be used to constrain the ion kinetic\nenergy to be <500 eV/u. This is accomplished by computing spectra and line\nratios via a range of theoretical methods and comparing these to experiments\nwith He over astrophysically relevant collision energies. The charge exchange\nemission spectra calculations were performed for Ne[10+] +H and Ne[10+] +He\nusing widely applied approaches including the atomic orbital close coupling,\nclassical trajectory Monte Carlo, and multichannel Landau- Zener (MCLZ)\nmethods. A comparison of the results from these methods indicates that for the\nconsidered energy range and neutrals (H, He) the so-called \"low-energy\nl-distribution\" MCLZ method provides the most likely reliable predictions.\n", "  A geyser can be reproduced by a toy experiment composed of a water pool\nlocated above a water reservoir, the two being connected by a long and narrow\ntube. When the bottom reservoir is heated, the system experiences periodic\neruptions of hot water and steam at the top similarly to the geyser effect\noccurring in nature. The eruption frequency of a toy geyser is inspected\nexperimentally as a function of the heating power and the height of the set-up.\nWe propose a thermodynamic model of this system which predicts the time between\neruptions. Besides, the geometric and thermodynamic conditions required to\nobserve a geyser effect are discussed. The study of the toy geyser is then\nextended to the case of two reservoirs connected to the same tube. In such a\nconfiguration, an eruption in a reservoir may entrain the eruption of the\nother. Such a coupled system adopts a complex time-evolution which reflects the\ndynamics of natural geysers. We analyze the behavior of a toy geyser with two\nreservoirs by the way of statistical tools and develop a theoretical model in\norder to rationalize our observations.\n", "  In conventional light harvesting devices, the absorption of a single photon\nonly excites one electron, which sets the standard limit of power-conversion\nefficiency, such as the Shockley-Queisser limit. In principle, generating and\nharnessing multiple carriers per absorbed photon can improve the efficiency and\npossibly overcome this limit. Here, we report the observation of multiple hot\ncarrier collection in graphene-boron-nitride Moire superlattice structures. A\nrecord-high zero-bias photoresponsivity of 0.3 ampere per watt, equivalently,\nan external quantum efficiency exceeding 50 percent, is achieved utilizing\ngraphene photo-Nernst effect, which demonstrates a collection of at least 5\ncarriers per absorbed photon. We reveal that this effect arises from the\nenhanced Nernst coefficient through Lifshtiz transition at low energy Van Hove\nsingularities, which is an emergent phenomenon due to the formation of Moire\nminibands. Our observation points to a new means for extremely efficient and\nflexible optoelectronics based on van der Waals heterostructures.\n", "  We describe an IFEL interaction driven by a guided broadband THz source to\ncompress a relativistic electron bunch and synchronize it with an external\nlaser pulse. A high field near single-cycle THz pulse, generated via optical\nrectification from the external laser source, is group velocity-matched to the\nelectron bunch inside a waveguide, allowing for a sustained interaction in a\nmagnetic undulator. We present measurements of the THz waveform before and\nafter a curved parallel plate waveguide with varying aperture size and estimate\nthe reduced group velocity. For a proof-of-concept experiment at the UCLA\nPEGASUS laboratory, a 6 MeV, 100 fs electron bunch with an initial 0.03 %\nenergy spread can be readily produced. Given these parameters and a projected\nTHz peak field of 10 MV/m, our simulation model predicts a phase space rotation\nof the bunch distribution that compresses the electron bunch by nearly an order\nof magnitude and reduces any initial timing jitter within the phase acceptance\nwindow. We also discuss the application of this guided-THz IFEL experimental\nset-up towards a THz streaking diagnostic with the potential for femtosecond\nscale temporal resolution.\n", "  We investigate the proof of concept and the implications of \\textit{refracted\ngravity}, a novel modified gravity aimed to solve the discrepancy between the\nluminous and the dynamical mass of cosmic structures without resorting to dark\nmatter. Inspired by the behavior of electric fields in matter, refracted\ngravity introduces a gravitational permittivity that depends on the local mass\ndensity and modifies the standard Poisson equation. The resulting gravitational\nfield can become more intense than the Newtonian field and can mimic the\npresence of dark matter. We show that the refracted gravitational field\ncorrectly describes (1) the rotation curves and the Tully-Fisher relation of\ndisk galaxies; and (2) the observed temperature profile of the X-ray gas of\ngalaxy clusters. According to these promising results, we conclude that\nrefracted gravity deserves further investigation.\n", "  The nuclear mean-field potential arising from the $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C\ninteraction at the low energies relevant for the astrophysical carbon burning\nprocess has been constructed within the double-folding model, using the\nrealistic nuclear ground-state density of the $^{12}$C nucleus and the\neffective M3Y nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction constructed from the G-matrix of\nthe Paris (free) NN potential. To explore the nuclear medium effect, both the\noriginal density independent M3Y-Paris interaction and its density dependent\nCDM3Y6 version have been used in the folding model calculation of the\n$^{12}$C+$^{12}$C potential. The folded potentials at the different energies\nwere used in the optical model description of the elastic $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C\nscattering at the energies around and below the Coulomb barrier, as well as in\nthe barrier penetration model to estimate the fusion cross section and\nastrophysical $S$ factor of the $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C reactions at the low\nenergies. The obtained results are in good agreement with experimental data\nover a wide range of energies.\n", "  This paper extends previous results on constructing a direct coupling quantum\nobserver for a quantum harmonic oscillator system. In this case, we consider a\ncomplex linear quantum system plant consisting of a network of quantum harmonic\noscillators. Conditions are given for which there exists a direct coupling\nobserver which estimates a collection of variables in the quantum plant. It is\nshown that the order of the observer can be the same as the number of variables\nto be estimated when this number is even and thus this is a reduced order\nobserver.\n", "  This paper surveys some recent results on the theory of quantum linear\nsystems and presents them within a unified framework. Quantum linear systems\nare a class of systems whose dynamics, which are described by the laws of\nquantum mechanics, take the specific form of a set of linear quantum stochastic\ndifferential equations (QSDEs). Such systems commonly arise in the area of\nquantum optics and related disciplines. Systems whose dynamics can be described\nor approximated by linear QSDEs include interconnections of optical cavities,\nbeam-spitters, phase-shifters, optical parametric amplifiers, optical\nsqueezers, and cavity quantum electrodynamic systems. With advances in quantum\ntechnology, the feedback control of such quantum systems is generating new\nchallenges in the field of control theory. Potential applications of such\nquantum feedback control systems include quantum computing, quantum error\ncorrection, quantum communications, gravity wave detection, metrology, atom\nlasers, and superconducting quantum circuits.\n  A recently emerging approach to the feedback control of quantum linear\nsystems involves the use of a controller which itself is a quantum linear\nsystem. This approach to quantum feedback control, referred to as coherent\nquantum feedback control, has the advantage that it does not destroy quantum\ninformation, is fast, and has the potential for efficient implementation. This\npaper discusses recent results concerning the synthesis of H-infinity optimal\ncontrollers for linear quantum systems in the coherent control case. An\nimportant issue which arises both in the modelling of linear quantum systems\nand in the synthesis of linear coherent quantum controllers is the issue of\nphysical realizability. This issue relates to the property of whether a given\nset of QSDEs corresponds to a physical quantum system satisfying the laws of\nquantum mechanics.\n", "  By applying density functional theory calculations to iron chalcogenides, we\nfind that magnetic order in Fe$_{1+y}$Te and magnetic instability at\n$(\\pi,\\pi)$ in K$_y$Fe$_2$Se$_2$ are controlled by interstitial and interlayer\ncations, respectively. While in Fe$_{1+y}$Te, magnetic phase transitions occur\namong collinear, exotic bicollinear and plaquette-ordered antiferronmagnetic\nstates when the height of interstitial irons measured from iron plane or the\nconcentration of interstitial irons is varied, the magnetic instability at\n$(\\pi,\\pi)$ which is believed to be responsible for the Cooper pairing in iron\npnictides is significantly enhanced when $y$ is much smaller than $1$ in\nK$_y$Fe$_2$Se$_2$. Our results indicate that, similar to iron pnictides,\nitinerant electrons play important roles in iron chalcogenides, even though the\nfluctuating local moments become larger.\n", "  Slowing/stopping the light travelling in free space with electromagnetically\ninduced transparency to im- plement the optical quantum information processings\nand store information has been paid much attention in recent years. For the\nwaveguide photons, here, we propose an approach to stop them with a\ncontrollable atomic cavity generated by a pair of atomic mirrors; one of them\nreflects the photon completely and an- other one with the adjustable\nreflected/transmitted probability of the photons. Based on the full quantum\nmechanical theory in real space, we show that the reflected/transmitted\nprobability of the waveguide photon with a fixed frequency can be controlled by\nadjusting the energy-splitting of the driven two-level atomic scatters (i.e.,\natomic mirrors). As a consequence, the photon can be controllably\ntransmitted/reflected along the waveguide by the aside atomic mirrors with the\nadjustable atomic energy levels. Ideally, the photons could be stopped in the\natomic cavity. This provides a novel mechanism to stop/retravel the waveguide\nphoton in a controllable ways. The feasibility of the proposal with the current\nintegrated optical devices is also discussed.\n", "  Properties of QCD at finite imaginary chemical potential are revisited to\nutilize for the model building of QCD in low energy regimes. For example, the\nelectric holonomy which is closely related to the Polyakov-loop drastically\naffects thermodynamic quantities beside the Roberge-Weiss transition line. To\nincorporate several properties at finite imaginary chemical potential, it is\nimportant to introduce the holonomy effects to the coupling constant of\neffective models. This extension is possible by considering the entanglement\nvertex. We show justifications of the entanglement vertex based on the\nderivation of the effective four-fermi interaction in the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio\nmodel and present its general form with the local approximation. To discuss how\nto remove model ambiguities in the entanglement vertex, we calculate the chiral\ncondensate with different $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ sectors and the dual quark condensate.\n", "  The polycrystalline samples of LaGa1-xFexO3 have been prepared by standard\nsolid state reaction route. The phase purity of the prepared samples is\nconfirmed by powder xray diffraction experiments followed by Rietveld analysis.\nIt has been observed that the variation of lattice parameters is governed by\nVegards law. The optical band gap of these samples is estimated using diffuse\nreflectance analysis and it is observed that the optical gap systematically\ndecreases with Fe doping from 3.62 eV and attains the saturation value of\napproximately 1.9 eV at x equal to 0.4. The value of the bowing parameter b for\nthe prepared solid solution LaGa1-xFexO3 is estimated to be 3.8eV.The xray\nabsorption near edge spectroscopy XANES suggests that the Fe is in mixed\nvalence state in all prepared samples and these mixed states of Fe due to\noffstoichiometry acts like electron doping in LaGa1-xFexO3 and thereby results\nin the reduction in the effective band gap. Our results may be useful to design\nthe LaGaO3based light emitting diodes and new generation of semiconductor\nphoto-detectors.\n", "  We investigate the effect of on-site Coulomb repulsion $U$ on the band gap of\nthe electrically gated bilayer graphene by employing coherent potential\napproximation in the paramagnetic state, based on an ionic two-layer Hubbard\nmodel. We find that, while either the on-site Coulomb repulsion $U$ or the\nexternal perpendicular electric field $E$ alone will favor a gapped state in\nthe bilayer graphene, competition between them will surprisingly lead to a\nsuppression of the gap amplitude. Our results can be applied to understand the\ndiscrepancies of gap size reported from optical and transport measurements, as\nwell as the puzzling features observed in angular resolved photoemission\nspectroscopic study.\n", "  This is an editorial to the special issue on Cosmic Dust VII.\n", "  The evolution equation for inhomogeneous and anisotropic temperature\nfluctuations inside a medium is derived within the ambit of Boltzmann Transport\nEquation. Also, taking some existing realistic inputs we have analyzed the\nFourier space variation of temperature fluctuation for the medium created after\nheavy-ion collisions. The effect of viscosity on the variation of fluctuations\nis investigated. Further, possible implications in hadronic and heavy-ion\ncollisions are explored.\n", "  We perform a Taylor series expansion of Tsallis distribution by assuming the\nTsallis parameter $q$ close to 1. The $q$ value shows the deviation of a system\nfrom a thermalised Boltzmann distribution. By taking up to first order in\n$(q-1)$, we derive an analytical result for Tsallis distribution including\nradial flow. Further, in the present work, we also study the speed of sound\n($c_s$) as a function of temperature using the non-extensive Tsallis statistics\nfor different $q$ values and for different mass cut-offs.\n", "  The transverse momentum spectra at RHIC and LHC for A+A and p+p collisions\nare studied with Tsallis distributions in different approaches i.e. with and\nwithout radial flow. The information on the freeze-out surface in terms of\nfreeze-out volume, temperature, chemical potential and radial flow velocities\nfor different particle species are obtained. These parameters are found to show\na systematic behavior with mass dependence. It is observed that the heavier\nparticles freeze-out early as compared to lighter particles and freeze-out\nsurfaces are different for different particles, which is a direct signature of\nmass dependent differential freeze-out. Further, we observe that the radial\nflow velocity decreases with increasing mass. This confirms the mass ordering\nbehavior in collectivity observed in heavy-ion collisions. It is also observed\nthat the systems created in peripheral heavy-ion collisions and in\nproton-proton collisions are of similar thermodynamic nature.\n", "  The resonant-cavity-enhanced (RCE) technique is an important approach to\nincreasing the detection efficiency (DE) of typical free-space coupling\nphotons. Here, we show that such a technique can also be utilized to increase\nthe detection probability (DP) of a single waveguide-coupled photon. Based on a\nfully quantum mechanical theory in real space, we exactly calculated the\nabsorption probability of a single photon for a two-level detector next to the\nwaveguide. We find that the DP of the waveguide photon for the detector in a\nwaveguide-coupled ring cavity is significantly higher than that for the bare\ndetector directly coupled to the photon. Physically, the DP of the photon for\nthe bare detector next to the waveguide is always limited by the finite\ntransmission and reflection probabilities of the photon. The cavity technique\nis used to store the photon and thus increase its DP. The feasibility of the\nproposal with current integrated optical devices is then discussed.\n", "  An experimental study of flows of the green non-motile Chlorella micro-alga\nin a plane microchannel is presented. Depending on the value of the cell volume\nfraction, three distinct flow regimes are observed. For low values of the cell\nvolume fraction a Newtonian flow regime characterised by a Poiseuille like flow\nfield, absence of wall slip and hydrodynamic reversibility of the flow states\nis observed. For intermediate values of the cell volume fraction, the flow\nprofiles are consistent with a Poiseuille flow of a shear thinning fluid in the\npresence of slip at the channel's wall. For even larger cell volume fractions,\na yield stress like behaviour manifested through the presence of a central\nsolid plug is observed. Except for the Newtonian flow regime, a strong\nhydrodynamic irreversibility of the flow and wall slip are found. The\ncalculation of the wall shear rate and wall stress based on the measured flow\nfields allows one to identify the mechanisms of wall slip observed in the shear\nthinning and yield stress regimes.\n", "  In a common paradigm, the electronic structure of condensed matter is divided\ninto weakly and strongly correlated compounds. While conventional band theory\nusually works well for the former class, many-body effects are essential for\nthe latter. Materials like the familiar SrTiO$_3$ compound that bridge or even\nabandon this characterization scheme are highly interesting. Here it is shown\nby means of combining density functional theory with dynamical-mean field\ntheory that oxygen vacancies on the STO (001) surface give rise to a dichotomy\nof weakly-correlated $t_{2g}$ low-energy quasiparticles and localized 'in-gap'\nstates of dominant $e_g$ character with subtle correlation signature. We\nfurthermore touch base with recent experimental work and study the surface\ninstability towards magnetic order.\n", "  We introduce a HST/STIS stellar census of R136a, the central ionizing star\ncluster of 30 Doradus. We present low resolution far-ultraviolet STIS/MAMA\nspectroscopy of R136 using 17 contiguous 52x0.2 arcsec slits which together\nprovide complete coverage of the central 0.85 parsec (3.4 arcsec). We provide\nspectral types of 90% of the 57 sources brighter than m_F555W = 16.0 mag within\na radius of 0.5 parsec of R136a1, plus 8 additional nearby sources including\nR136b (O4\\,If/WN8). We measure wind velocities for 52 early-type stars from CIV\n1548-51, including 16 O2-3 stars. For the first time we spectroscopically\nclassify all Weigelt & Baier members of R136a, which comprise three WN5 stars\n(a1-a3), two O supergiants (a5-a6) and three early O dwarfs (a4, a7, a8). A\ncomplete Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the most massive O stars in R136 is\nprovided, from which we obtain a cluster age of 1.5+0.3_-0.7 Myr. In addition,\nwe discuss the integrated ultraviolet spectrum of R136, and highlight the\ncentral role played by the most luminous stars in producing the prominent HeII\n1640 emission line. This emission is totally dominated by very massive stars\nwith initial masses above ~100 Msun. The presence of strong HeII 1640 emission\nin the integrated light of very young star clusters (e.g A1 in NGC 3125)\nfavours an initial mass function extending well beyond a conventional upper\nlimit of 100 Msun. We include montages of ultraviolet spectroscopy for LMC O\nstars in the Appendix. Future studies in this series will focus on optical\nSTIS/CCD medium resolution observations.\n", "  We present a novel method for sorting events. So far, single variables like\nflow vector magnitude were used for sorting events. Our approach takes into\naccount the whole azimuthal angle distribution rather than a single variable.\nThis method allows us to determine the good measure of the event shape,\nproviding a multiplicity-independent insight. We discuss the advantages and\ndisadvantages of this approach, the possible usage in femtoscopy, and other\nmore exclusive experimental studies.\n", "  We analyze the asymptotic scaling of persistence of unvisited sites for\nquantum walks on a line. In contrast to the classical random walk there is no\nconnection between the behaviour of persistence and the scaling of variance. In\nparticular, we find that for a two-state quantum walks persistence follows an\ninverse power-law where the exponent is determined solely by the coin\nparameter. Moreover, for a one-parameter family of three-state quantum walks\ncontaining the Grover walk the scaling of persistence is given by two\ncontributions. The first is the inverse power-law. The second contribution to\nthe asymptotic behaviour of persistence is an exponential decay coming from the\ntrapping nature of the studied family of quantum walks. In contrast to the\ntwo-state walks both the exponent of the inverse power-law and the decay\nconstant of the exponential decay depend also on the initial coin state and its\ncoherence. Hence, one can achieve various regimes of persistence by altering\nthe initial condition, ranging from purely exponential decay to purely inverse\npower-law behaviour.\n", "  Fractionalised excitations that emerge from a many body system have revealed\nrich physics and concepts, from composite fermions in two-dimensional electron\nsystems, revealed through the fractional quantum Hall effect, to spinons in\nantiferromagnetic chains and, more recently, fractionalisation of Dirac\nelectrons in graphene and magnetic monopoles in spin ice. Even more surprising\nis the fragmentation of the degrees of freedom themselves, leading to\ncoexisting and a priori independent ground states. This puzzling phenomenon was\nrecently put forward in the context of spin ice, in which the magnetic moment\nfield can fragment, resulting in a dual ground state consisting of a\nfluctuating spin liquid, a so-called Coulomb phase, on top of a magnetic\nmonopole crystal. Here we show, by means of neutron scattering measurements,\nthat such fragmentation occurs in the spin ice candidate Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. We\nobserve the spectacular coexistence of an antiferromagnetic order induced by\nthe monopole crystallisation and a fluctuating state with ferromagnetic\ncorrelations. Experimentally, this fragmentation manifests itself via the\nsuperposition of magnetic Bragg peaks, characteristic of the ordered phase, and\na pinch point pattern, characteristic of the Coulomb phase. These results\nhighlight the relevance of the fragmentation concept to describe the physics of\nsystems that are simultaneously ordered and fluctuating.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to revisit the Bianchi identities existing for\nthe Riemann and Weyl tensors in the combined framework of the formal theory of\nsystems of partial differential equations (Spencer cohomology, differential\nsystems, formal integrability) and Algebraic Analysis (homological algebra,\ndifferential modules, duality). In particular, we prove that the n 2 (n 2 --\n1)(n -- 2)/24 generating Bianchi identities for the Riemann tensor are first\norder and can be easily described by means of the Spencer cohomology of the\nfirst order Killing symbol in arbitrary dimension n $\\ge$ 2. Similarly, the n(n\n2 -- 1)(n + 2)(n -- 4)/24 generating Bianchi identities for the Weyl tensor are\nfirst order and can be easily described by means of the Spencer cohomology of\nthe first order conformal Killing symbol in arbitrary dimension n $\\ge$ 5. As A\nMOST SURPRISING RESULT, the 9 generating Bianchi identities for the Weyl tensor\nare of second order in dimension n = 4 while the analogue of the Weyl tensor\nhas 5 components of third order in the metric with 3 first order generating\nBianchi identities in dimension n = 3. The above results, which could not be\nobtained otherwise, are valid for any non-degenerate metric of constant\nriemannian curvature and do not depend on any conformal factor. They are\nchecked in an Appendix produced by Alban Quadrat (INRIA, Lille) by means of\ncomputer algebra. We finally explain why the work of Lanczos and followers is\nnot coherent with these results and must therefore be also revisited.\n", "  The mechanical response of glasses remains challenging to understand. Recent\nresults indicate that the oscillatory rheology of soft glasses is accompanied\nby a sharp non-equilibrium transition in the microscopic dynamics. Here, we use\nsimultaneous x-ray scattering and rheology to investigate the reversibility and\nhysteresis of the sharp sharp symmetry change from anisotropic solid to\nisotropic liquid dynamics observed in the oscillatory shear of colloidal\nglasses [D. V. Denisov, M. T. Dang, B. Struth, A. Zaccone, and P. Schall, Sci.\nRep. 5, 14359 (2015)]. We use strain sweeps with increasing and decreasing\nstrain amplitude to show that, in analogy to equilibrium transitions, this\nsharp symmetry change is reversible and exhibits systematic frequency-dependent\nhysteresis. Using the non-affine response formalism of amorphous solids, we\nshow that these hysteresis effects arise from frequency-dependent non-affine\nstructural cage rearrangements at large strain. These results consolidate the\nfirst-order like nature of the oscillatory shear transition and quantify\nrelated hysteresis effects both via measurements and theoretical modelling.\n", "  The dielectric behavior of the single crystals of the spin-chain system\nCa3Co2O6, undergoing geometrically frustrated antiferromagnetic ordering below\n25 K, has been investigated as a function of temperature and magnetic field (H)\nand compared with magnetization (M) behavior. The results provide evidence for\nanisotropic magnetodielectric (MDE) coupling in this compound. Ac\nsusceptibility exhibits a strong frequency dependence for H parallel c with\nchanges of this feature with the application of external dc magnetic field. No\nfeature in ac susceptibility could be observed for H perpendicular c, thereby\nproviding evidence for strong anisotropic spin-glass behavior. Interestingly,\nthe strong frequency dependence in dielectric is present for both the\ncrystallographic directions (E parallel c and E perpendicular c where E is the\nelectric field) with a negligible influence of H, despite the existence of MDE\ncoupling. This result appears to suggest different dynamics of electric dipole\nand spin-glass, although they are coupled with each other. In addition,\ninterestingly, there is also a step at one-third of high-(magnetic) field value\nof MDE at some temperatures tracking a similar step in M(H). This work also\nconfirms following unusual features reported on polycrystals, when measured\nalong c-axis. The dielectric constant exhibits a broad peak around 50-130 K\nwhen the electric field is applied along the spin-chain (crystallographic c\ndirection); however this feature is essentially absent for the perpendicular\norientation. This finding supports the role of incipient spin-chain ordering to\ninduce magnetodielectric coupling. There is a signature of magnetoelectric\nphase coexistence when the magnetic field is applied along the spin-chain\nirrespective of the direction of applied electric field.\n", "  Adiabatic evolution is a powerful technique in quantum information and\ncomputation. However, its performance is limited by the adiabatic theorem of\nquantum mechanics. In this scenario, shortcuts to adiabaticity, such as\nprovided by the superadiabatic theory, constitute a valuable tool to speed up\nthe adiabatic quantum behavior. In this dissertation we introduce two different\nmodels to perform universal superadiabatic quantum computing, which are based\non the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity by counter-diabatic Hamiltonians. The\nfirst model is based on the use of superadiabatic quantum teleportation,\nintroduced in this dissertation, as a primitive to quantum computing. Thus, we\nprovide the counter-diabatic driving for arbitrary $n$-qubit gates. In\naddition, our approach maps the counter-diabatic Hamiltonian for an arbitrary\n$n$-qubit {\\it gate} teleportation into the implementation of a rotated\ncounter-diabatic Hamiltonian for an $n$-qubit {\\it state} teleportation. In the\nsecond model we use the concept of controlled superadiabatic evolutions to show\nhow we can implement arbitrary $n$-controlled quantum gates. Remarkably, this\ntask can be performed by simple time-independent counter-diabatic Hamiltonians.\nThese two models can be used to design different sets of universal quantum\ngates. We show that the use of the quantum speed limit suggests that the\nsuperadiabatic time evolution is compatible with arbitrarily small time\nintervals, where this arbitrariness is constrained to the energetic cost\nnecessary to perform the superadiabatic evolution.\n", "  We report on an optimal single-electron charge qubit for a solid-state double\nquantum dot (DQD) system and analyse its dynamics under a time-dependent linear\ndetuning, using GPU accelerated numerical solutions to the time-dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. The optimal qubit is found to have basis states defined\nas the symmetric and antisymmetric linear combinations of the lowest energy\nbonding and anti-bonding states of the DQD at zero bias. In contrast to charge\nqubits defined by the two localised ground states of the uncoupled DQD, this\nchoice of the basis causes the resulting dynamics to have a maximal overlap\nwith an idealised two-state model. Our optimal qubit basis states are not\nlocalised to a single quantum dot and, as such, initialising the qubit requires\na particular sequence of gate pulses to take the system from an initial\nfiducial state of the DQD to the logical $0$ or $1$. We determine this sequence\nusing pulses that incorporate the expected experimental finite rise times. We\nalso show how to perform arbitrary single qubit operations on the Bloch sphere\nusing spin-echo type pulsing, allowing us to obtain any qubit state with at\nmost two single pulses. Measurement of the optimal qubits is achieved by\ndetermining the probability of finding the electron in one of the dots.\n", "  The gravitational interaction between two objects on similar orbits can\neffect noticeable changes in the orbital evolution even if the ratio of their\nmasses to that of the central body is vanishingly small. Christou (2005)\nobserved an occasional resonant lock in the differential node $\\Delta \\Omega$\nbetween two members in the Himalia irregular satellite group of Jupiter in the\n$N$-body simulations (corresponding mass ratio $\\sim 10^{-9}$). Using a\nsemianalytical approach, we have reproduced this phenomenon. We also\ndemonstrate the existence of two additional types of resonance, involving angle\ndifferences $\\Delta\\omega$ and $\\Delta (\\Omega+\\varpi)$ between two group\nmembers. These resonances cause secular oscillations in eccentricity and/or\ninclination on timescales $\\sim$ 1 Myr. We locate these resonances in $(a,e,i)$\nspace and analyse their topological structure. In subsequent $N$-body\nsimulations, we confirm these three resonances and find a fourth one involving\n$\\Delta \\varpi$. In addition, we study the occurrence rates and the stability\nof the four resonances from a statistical perspective by integrating 1000 test\nparticles for 100 Myr. We find $\\sim 10-30$ librators for each of the\nresonances. Particularly, the nodal resonance found by Christou is the most\nstable: 2 particles are observed to stay in libration for the entire\nintegration.\n", "  We theoretically studied the implementation of a quantum memory and an\noptical transistor in a system composed by a single atom trapped inside a high\nfinesse cavity. In order to store and map the quantum state of an input pulse\nonto internal states of the single atom (quantum memory) we employ the\nelectromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) phenomenon (which can work out\nas an optical transistor) where the information can be transferred to the dark\nstate of the atom modelled by a three-level system in a {\\Lambda}-type\nconfiguration. In our model we consider a suitable temporal shape for the\ncontrol field that ensures the adiabaticity of the storage process and\nretrieval of the probe pulse. The dynamic of the field inside the cavity was\nobtained by master equation approach, while the outside field was calculated by\ninput-output formalism. We have analysed two different setups: i) two-sided and\nii) single-sided cavities. While the first setup is the most appropriate and\ncommonly used to observe cavity-EIT in the transmission spectrum, thus the best\nconfiguration for the optical transistor, the maximum quantum memory efficiency\ncan not reach reasonable values, being limited to 50% for symmetric cavities.\nOn the other hand, with single-sided cavity the quantum memory efficiency\nincreases considerably and can reach values close to 100% in the strong\natom-field coupling regime. However this specific setup is not favourable to\nobserve the cavity-EIT effect in the transmission spectrum and then it is not\nappropriate to control the transmission of light pulses.\n", "  We propose a new model of the liquidity driven banking system focusing on\novernight interbank loans. This significant branch of the interbank market is\ncommonly neglected in the banking system modeling and systemic risk analysis.\nWe construct a model where banks are allowed to use both the interbank and the\nsecurities markets to manage their liquidity demand and supply as driven by\nprudential requirements in a volatile environment. The network of interbank\nloans is dynamic and simulated every day. We show how only the intrasystem cash\nfluctuations, without any external shocks, may lead to systemic defaults, what\nmay be a symptom of the self-organized criticality of the system. We also\nanalyze the impact of different prudential regulations and market conditions on\nthe interbank market resilience. We confirm that central bank's asset purchase\nprograms, limiting the declines in government bond prices, can successfully\nstabilize bank's liquidity demand. The model can be used to analyze the\ninterbank market impact of macroprudential tools.\n", "  Data for voltage-activation of a potassium channel (Matulef et al. Proc Natl\nAcad Sci USA 110: 17886-17891. 2013) were, as conventionally done, fitted by\nthe authors by a Boltzmann function, i.e. by a curvilinear profile. Reanalysis\nof the data reveals however that this interpretation must be rejected in favor\nof a multiphasic profile, a series of straight lines separated by discontinuous\ntransitions, quite often in the form of noncontiguities (jumps). In contrast to\nthe generally very poor fits to the Boltzmann profiles, the fits to multiphasic\nprofiles are very good. (For the four replicates, the average deviations from\nthe Boltzmann curves were 10- to 100-fold larger than the deviations from the\nmultiphasic profiles.) The difference in the median values was statistically\nhighly significant, P<0.001 in most cases. For the mean values the deviations\nfrom the Boltzmann curve were 20-fold larger than the deviations from the\nmultiphasic profile, and the difference in the median values was also highly\nsignificant. The curvilinear interpretation must be rejected also because of\nthe uneven distribution of the points around the Boltzmann curves. The combined\nprobability for the four replicates that this uneven distribution is due to\nchance is less than 0.002.\n  In addition to activation of ion channels, a wide variety of biological as\nwell as non-biological processes and phenomena involving binding, pH,\nfolding/unfolding and effect of chain length can be well represented by\nmultiphasic profiles (Nissen 2015a,b. Posted on arXiv.org with Paper ID arXiv:\n1511.06601 and 1512.02561).\n", "  Multiple-degrees-of-freedom free-space communication combining polarization\nand high-order spatial modes promises high-capacity communication channel.\nWhile high-order spatial modes have been widely exploited for dense coding and\nhigh-dimensional quantum information processing, the properties of polarization\npreservation of high-order spatial beams propagating in turbulent atmosphere\nhave not been comprehensively investigated yet. Here we focus on the properties\nof polarization preservation of partially coherent Hermite-Gaussian beams\npropagating along different atmospheric turbulence paths. The analytical\nexpressions for the polarization of partially coherent Hermite-Gaussian beams\npropagating through atmospheric turbulence along different paths have been\nderived. It is shown that the larger the coherence length is, and the larger\nthe beam order m, n are, the less the polarization is changed. We find that the\nevolution properties of the polarization in slant-down paths through turbulent\natmosphere are similar to the case in free space if the condition zenith angle\n{\\xi}<{\\pi}/4 is satisfied. While at a long propagation distance, evolution\nproperties of polarization in horizontal paths of turbulent atmosphere differs\nmuch from that in free space and in slant paths. The results may allow one to\nchoose the optimal propagation path in terms of specific applications, which is\nhelpful for future experimental implementation of multiple-degrees-of-freedom\nfree-space communication.\n", "  The coefficients of new analytical forms for the deuteron wave function in\ncoordinate space for NijmI, NijmII, Nijm93, Reid93 and Argonne v18 potentials\nhave been numerically calculated. The obtained wave functions do not contain\nany superfluous knots. The designed parameters of the deuteron are in good\nagreement with the experimental and theoretical data. The new parameterization\nof the deuteron wave function in momentum space is obtained. The tensor\npolarization t20 calculated based on the wave functions is proportionate to the\nearlier published results.\n", "  Exact free energy minimization is a convex optimization problem that is\nusually approximated with stochastic sampling methods. Deterministic\napproximations have been less successful because many desirable properties have\nbeen difficult to attain. Such properties include the preservation of\nconvexity, lower bounds on free energy, and applicability to systems without\nsubsystem structure. We satisfy all of these properties by embedding free\nenergy minimization into a linear program over energy-resolved expectation\nvalues. Numerical results on small systems are encouraging, but a lack of size\nconsistency necessitates further development for large systems.\n", "  Triangle-hinge models [arXiv:1503.08812] are introduced to describe\nworldvolume dynamics of membranes. The Feynman diagrams consist of triangles\nglued together along hinges and can be restricted to tetrahedral decompositions\nin a large N limit. In this paper, after clarifying that all the tetrahedra\nresulting in the original models are orientable, we define a version of\ntriangle-hinge models that can describe the dynamics of unoriented membranes.\nBy regarding each triangle as representing a propagation of an open membrane of\ndisk topology, we introduce a local worldvolume parity transformation which\ninverts the orientation of triangle, and define unoriented triangle-hinge\nmodels by gauging the transformation. Unlike two-dimensional cases, this local\ntransformation generally relates a manifold to a nonmanifold, but still is a\nwell-defined manipulation among tetrahedral decompositions. We further show\nthat matter fields can be introduced in the same way as in the original\noriented models. In particular, the models will describe unoriented membranes\nin a target spacetime by taking matter fields to be the target space\ncoordinates.\n", "  The study of the high-multiplicity pp events has become important because we\nneed to understand the origin of the fluid-like features which have been found\nin such small systems. In this work we concentrate on the radial flow\nsignatures. To this end, the role of jets in high-multiplicity pp collisions is\ninvestigated using PYTHIA 8.\n", "  We consider a diffuse interface approximation for the lipid phases of\nrotationally symmetric two-phase bilayer membranes and rigorously derive its\n$\\Gamma$-limit. In particular, we prove that limit vesicles are $C^1$ across\ninterfaces, which justifies a regularity assumption that is widely made in\nformal asymptotic and numerical studies. Moreover, a limit membrane may consist\nof several topological spheres, which are connected at the axis of revolution\nand resemble complete buds of the vesicle.\n", "  We investigated the effects of first-forbidden transitions in $\\beta$ decays\non the production of the r-process $A \\sim 195$ peak. The theoretical\ncalculated $\\beta$-decay rates with $\\beta$-delayed neutron emission were\nexamined using several astrophysical conditions. As the first-borbidden decay\nis dominant in $N \\sim 126$ neutron-rich nuclei, their inclusion shortens\n$\\beta$-decay lifetimes and shifts the abundance peak towards higher masses.\nAdditionally, the inclusion of the $\\beta$-delayed neutron emission results in\na wider abundance peak, and smoothens the mass distribution by removing the\nodd-even mass staggering. The effects are commonly seen in the results of all\nadopted astrophysical models. Nevertheless there are quantitative differences,\nindicating that remaining uncertainty in the determination of half-lives for\n$N=126$ nuclei is still significant in order to determine the production of the\nr-process peak.\n", "  Earth's atmosphere is in a state far from thermodynamic equilibrium. For\nexample, the large scale equator-to-pole temperature gradient is maintained by\ntropical heating, polar cooling, and a midlatitude meridional eddy heat flux\npredominantly driven by baroclinically unstable weather systems. Based on basic\nthermodynamic principles, it can be shown that the meridional heat flux, in\ncombination with the meridional temperature gradient, acts to maximize entropy\nproduction of the atmosphere. In fact, maximum entropy production (MEP) has\nbeen successfully used to explain the observed mean state of the atmosphere and\nother components of the climate system. However, one important feature of the\nlarge scale atmospheric circulation is its often non-Gaussian variability about\nthe mean. This paper presents theoretical and observational evidence that some\nprocesses in the midlatitude atmosphere are significantly non-Gaussian to\nmaximize entropy production. First, after introducing the basic theory, it is\nshown that the skewness of sea surface winds, damped by nonlinear surface drag,\nare consistent with the MEP principle. Then it is pointed out that the observed\nwavenumber spectrum of long planetary waves in the midlatitudes can be roughly\nexplained by maximizing the meridional eddy heat flux (and related entropy\nproduction) of unstable baroclinic Eady waves. Finally observational evidence\nis presented that the meridional eddy heat flux is increased by non-Gaussian\nvariability in meridional wind and temperatures anomalies.\n", "  Nonlinear periodically poled ridge LiNbO3 waveguides have been fabricated on\nsilicon substrates. Components are carved with only use of a precision dicing\nmachine without need for grinding or polishing steps. They show efficient\nsecond harmonic generation at telecommunication wavelengths with normalized\nconversion reaching 204%/W in a 15 mm long device. Influence of geometrical non\nuniformities of waveguides due to fabrication process is asserted. Components\ncharacteristics are studied notably their robustness and tunability versus\ntemperature.\n", "  We discuss different definitions of pressure for a system of active spherical\nparticles driven by a non-thermal coloured noise. We show that mechanical,\nkinetic and free-energy based approaches lead to the same result up to first\norder in the non-equilibrium expansion parameter. The first prescription is\nbased on a generalisation of the kinetic mesoscopic virial equation and\nexpresses the pressure exerted on the walls in terms of the average of the\nvirial of the inter-particle forces. In the second approach, the pressure and\nthe surface tension are identified with the volume and area derivatives,\nrespectively, of the partition function associated with the known stationary\nnon-equilibrium distribution of the model. The third method is a mechanical\napproach and is related to the work necessary to deform the system. The\npressure is obtained by comparing the expression of the work in terms of local\nstress and strain with the corresponding expression in terms of microscopic\ndistribution. This is determined from the force balance encoded in the\nBorn-Green-Yvon equation. Such a method has the advantage of giving a formula\nfor the local pressure tensor and the surface tension even in inhomogeneous\nsituations. By direct inspection, we show that the three procedures lead to the\nsame values of the pressure, and give support to the idea that the partition\nfunction, obtained via the unified coloured noise approximation, is more than a\nformal property of the system, but determines the stationary non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics of the model.\n", "  If a quantum channel is commutable with a certain set of operators, a Choi\nstate of the channel becomes a sufficient resource for any entanglement\ngeneration achieved by a single use of the channel with the help of local\noperation and classical communications (LOCC). This property, called the\nteleportation stretchable, could be useful to determine an upper bound of a\nfundamental rate-loss trade-off for optical quantum key distribution.\nUnfortunately, the known formulation of the teleportation-stretching expansion\nfor lossy Gaussian channels is based on an additional assumption of the Choi\nstate with infinite energy. In this paper, we present an entanglement-assisted\nLOCC protocol with a bounded energy entangled state, and identify a resource\nstate being sufficient for a general entanglement generation protocol through a\nsingle use of lossy Gaussian channels. We also extend this protocol for the\ncases of general single-mode Gaussian channels. Our results provide a regular\npath to determine an ultimate limit of quantum communication.\n", "  The stochastic solution with Gaussian stationary increments is establihsed\nfor the symmetric space-time fractional diffusion equation when $0 < \\beta <\n\\alpha \\le 2$, where $0 < \\beta \\le 1$ and $0 < \\alpha \\le 2$ are the\nfractional derivation orders in time and space, respectively. This solution is\nprovided by imposing the identity between two probability density functions\nresulting (i) from a new integral representation formula of the fundamental\nsolution of the symmetric space-time fractional diffusion equation and (ii)\nfrom the product of two independent random variables. This is an alternative\nmethod with respect to previous approaches such as the scaling limit of the\ncontinuos time random walk, the parametric subordination and the subordinated\nLangevin equation. A new integral representation formula for the fundamental\nsolution of the space-time fractional diffusion equation is firstly derived. It\nis then shown that, in the symmetric case, a stochastic solution can be\nobtained by a Gaussian process with stationary increments and with a random\nwideness scale variable distributed according to an arrangement of two extremal\nL\\'evy stable densities. This stochastic solution is self-similar with\nstationary increments and uniquely defined in a statistical sense by the mean\nand the covariance structure. Numerical simulations are carried out by choosing\nas Gaussian process the fractional Brownian motion. Sample paths and\nprobability densities functions are shown to be in agreement with the\nfundamental solution of the symmetric space-time fractional diffusion equation.\n", "  Traditional lens design is a numerical and forward process based on ray\ntracing and aberration theory. This method has limitations because the initial\nconfiguration of the lens has to be specified and the aberrations of the lenses\nhave to considered. This paper is an initial attempt to investigate an analytic\nand inverse lens design method, called Lagrange, to overcome these barriers.\nLagrange method tries to build differential equations in terms of the system\nparameters and the system input and output (object and image). The generalized\nSnell's law in three dimensional space and the normal of a surface in\nfundamental differential geometry are applied. Based on the Lagrange method\nequations for a single surface system are derived which can perfectly image a\npoint object.\n", "  Starting from the definition of Cheeger-Simons K-character, we show how to\ndescribe D-brane world-volumes, the Wess-Zumino action and topological D-brane\ncharges within the K-theoretical framework in type II superstring theory. We\nstress in particular how each feature of the old cohomological classification\ncan be reproduced using the K-theoretical language.\n", "  The past decade has seen great advances in developing color centers in\ndiamond for sensing, quantum information processing, and tests of quantum\nfoundations. Increasingly, the success of these applications as well as\nfundamental investigations of light-matter interaction depend on improved\ncontrol of optical interactions with color centers -- from better fluorescence\ncollection to efficient and precise coupling with confined single optical\nmodes. Wide ranging research efforts have been undertaken to address these\ndemands through advanced nanofabrication of diamond. This review will cover\nrecent advances in diamond nano- and microphotonic structures for efficient\nlight collection, color center to nanocavity coupling, hybrid integration of\ndiamond devices with other material systems, and the wide range of fabrication\nmethods that have enabled these complex photonic diamond systems.\n", "  Co-intercalation is a potential approach to influence the voltage and\nmobility with which cations insert in electrodes for energy storage devices.\nCombining a robust thermodynamic model with first-principles calculations, we\npresent a detailed investigation revealing the important role of H$_2$O during\nion intercalation in nano-materials. We examine the scenario of Mg$^{2+}$ and\nH$_2$O co-intercalation in nano-crystalline Xerogel-V$_2$O$_5$, a potential\ncathode material to achieve energy density greater than Li-ion batteries. Water\nco-intercalation in cathode materials could broadly impact an electrochemical\nsystem by influencing its voltages or causing passivation at the anode. The\nanalysis of the stable phases of Mg-Xerogel V$_2$O$_5$ and voltages at\ndifferent electrolytic conditions reveals a range of concentrations for Mg in\nthe Xerogel and H$_2$O in the electrolyte where there is no thermodynamic\ndriving force for H$_2$O to shuttle with Mg during electrochemical cycling.\nAlso, we demonstrate that H$_2$O shuttling with the Mg$^{2+}$ ions in wet\nelectrolytes yields higher voltages than in dry electrolytes. The thermodynamic\nframework used to study water and Mg$^{2+}$ co-intercalation in this work opens\nthe door for studying the general phenomenon of solvent co-intercalation\nobserved in other complex solvent-electrode pairs used in the Li- and Na-ion\nchemical spaces.\n", "  In a recent work, Moshkovitz [FOCS '14] presented a transformation on\ntwo-player games called \"fortification\", and gave an elementary proof of an\n(exponential decay) parallel repetition theorem for fortified two-player\nprojection games. In this paper, we give an analytic reformulation of\nMoshkovitz's fortification framework, which was originally cast in\ncombinatorial terms. This reformulation allows us to expand the scope of the\nfortification method to new settings.\n  First, we show any game (not just projection games) can be fortified, and\ngive a simple proof of parallel repetition for general fortified games. Then,\nwe prove parallel repetition and fortification theorems for games with players\nsharing quantum entanglement, as well as games with more than two players. This\ngives a new gap amplification method for general games in the quantum and\nmultiplayer settings, which has recently received much interest.\n  An important component of our work is a variant of the fortification\ntransformation, called \"ordered fortification\", that preserves the entangled\nvalue of a game. The original fortification of Moshkovitz does not in general\npreserve the entangled value of a game, and this was a barrier to extending the\nfortification framework to the quantum setting.\n", "  We resolve the old riddle related to the critical behavior of the heat\ncapacity near the smectic A -- hexatic second order phase transition.\nExperiment suggests a \"large\" positive specific heat critical exponent\ninconsistent with the universality class for this phase transition implying the\nvery small negative exponent. We show that essential features of the heat\ncapacity for the smectic A -- hexatic phase transition can be rationalized in\nthe framework of a theoretical model treating jointly fluctuations of the\nhexatic orientational order and of the positional (translational) order\nparameters. Assuming that the positional (translational) correlation length is\nlarger than the hexatic correlation length, we calculate a temperature\ndependence of the specific heat in the critical region near the smectic A --\nhexatic phase transition. Our results are in a quantitative agreement with the\ncalorimetric experimental data.\n", "  One of classical boundary problems of the kinetic theory (a problem about\nthermal sliding) of the rarefied gas along a flat firm surface is considered.\nKinetic Boltzmann equation with model integral of collisions BGK (Bhatnagar,\nGross, Krook) is used. As boundary conditions the boundary Maxwell conditions\n(mirror-diffuse) are used. The generalized method of a source is applied to the\nproblem decision. Comparison with earlier received results is spent.\n", "  A known phase-functions method has been considered for calculation of a\nsingle-channel nucleon-nucleon scattering. The phase shifts of np- scattering\nturn out for modern realistic phenomenological nucleon-nucleon potentials\nReid93 but Argonne v18. Influence of choice of numeral method is explored on\nthe decision of phase equation. For the decision of phase equation as\ndifferential equation of 1th order numeral methods are used: Euler method and\nRunge-Kutta methods 2-, 3-, 4- and 5th orders of exactness. Numerically\ncalculated phase shifts of np- scattering for potentials Reid93 and Argonne v18\nare in good agreement with the results obtained with the other methods of\noriginal works. Based on the known phases of scattering one can obtain the full\namplitude, the full cross-section and the partial scattering amplitude\naccordingly. The used Runge-Kutta methods can be applied for finding of phases\nshifts of the mixed channels of nucleon-nucleon scattering.\n", "  RR Lyrae stars are classical pulsating stars. They pulsate mostly in the\nradial fundamental mode (RRab stars), in the radial first overtone mode (RRc\nstars), or in both modes simultaneously (RRd stars). Collection of variable\nstars from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) contains more\nthan 38 000 RR Lyrae stars from the Galactic bulge. We analysed these data for\nRRc and RRd stars. We have found new members of radial-non-radial double-mode\nRR Lyrae stars, with characteristic period ratio of the two modes around 0.61.\nWe increased the number of known RR Lyrae stars of this type by a factor of 8.\nWe have also discovered another group of double-mode RR Lyrae stars. They\npulsate in the first overtone and in another, unidentified mode, which has\nperiod longer than period of the undetected fundamental mode. The period ratios\ntightly cluster around 0.686. These proceedings are focused on this puzzling\ngroup. In particular, we report eight new members of the group.\n", "  A fully relativistic ab-initio study on free Rh clusters of 13-135 atoms is\nperformed to identify general trends concerning their magnetism and to check\nwhether concepts which proved to be useful in interpreting magnetism of 3d\nmetals are applicable to magnetism of 4d systems. We found that there is no\nsystematic relation between local magnetic moments and coordination numbers. On\nthe other hand, the Stoner model appears well-suited both as a criterion for\nthe onset of magnetism and as a guide for the dependence of local magnetic\nmoments on the site-resolved density of states at the Fermi level. Large\norbital magnetic moments antiparallel to spin magnetic moments were found for\nsome sites. The intra-atomic magnetic dipole Tz term can be quite large at\ncertain sites but as a whole it is unlikely to affect the interpretation of\nx-ray magnetic circular dichroism experiments based on the sum rules.\n", "  The exploitation of the processes used by microorganisms to digest nutrients\nfor their growth can be a viable method for the formation of a wide range of so\ncalled biogenic materials that have unique mechanical and physical properties\nthat are not produced by abiotic processes. Based on grape must and bread\nfermentation, a bionic composite made of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and\nsingle-cell fungi, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast extract, was prepared by\nfermentation of such microorganisms at room temperature.\n", "  The increasing number and complexity of planetary exploration space missions\nrequire new tools to access, visualize and analyse data to improve their\nscientific return.\n  ASI Science Data Center (ASDC) addresses this request with the web-tool\nMATISSE (Multi-purpose Advanced Tool for the Instruments of the Solar System\nExploration), allowing the visualization of single observation or real-time\ncomputed high-order products, directly projected on the three-dimensional model\nof the selected target body.\n  Using MATISSE it will be no longer needed to download huge quantity of data\nor to write down a specific code for every instrument analysed, greatly\nencouraging studies based on joint analysis of different datasets.\n  In addition the extremely high-resolution output, to be used offline with a\nPython-based free software, together with the files to be read with specific\nGIS software, makes it a valuable tool to further process the data at the best\nspatial accuracy available.\n  MATISSE modular structure permits addition of new missions or tasks and,\nthanks to dedicated future developments, it would be possible to make it\ncompliant to the Planetary Virtual Observatory standards currently under\ndefinition. In this context the recent development of an interface to the NASA\nODE REST API by which it is possible to access to public repositories is set.\n", "  A thin flat rectangular plate supported on its edges and subjected to\nin-plane loading exhibits stable post-buckling behaviour. However, the\nintroduction of a nonlinear (softening) elastic foundation may cause the\nresponse to become unstable. Here the post-buckling of such a structure is\ninvestigated and several important phenomena are identified, including the\ntransition of patterns from stripes to spots and back again. The interaction\nbetween these forms is of importance for understanding the possible\npost-buckling behaviours of this structural system. In addition, both periodic\nand some localized responses are found to exist as the dimensions of the plate\nare increased and this becomes relevant when the characteristic wavelengths of\nthe buckle pattern are small compared to the size of the plate. Potential\napplication of the model range from macroscopic industrial manufacturing of\nstructural elements to the understanding of micro- and nano-scale deformations\nin materials.\n", "  We derive relativistic corrections for one-way and two-way time and frequency\ntransfer over optical fibres neglecting no terms that exceed 1 ps in time and\n$10^{-18}$ in fractional frequency, and estimate their magnitude in typical\nfibre links. We also provide estimates of the uncertainties in the evaluation\nof the relativistic corrections due to imperfect knowledge of parameters like\nthe coordinates of the fibre and stations, Earth rotation, or thermal effects\nof the fibre index and length. The links between Teddington(UK) and Paris(F) as\nwell as Braunschweig(D) and Paris(F), that are currently under construction,\nare studied as specific examples.\n", "  A study of proper teleparallel conformal vector field in spherically\nsymmetric static space-times is given using the direct integration technique\nand diagonal tetrads. In this study we show that the above space-times do not\nadmit proper teleparallel conformal vector fields.\n", "  The (2+1)-dimensional higher-order Broer-Kaup (HBK) system is studied by\nnonlocal symmetry method and consistent tanh expansion (CTE) method in this\npaper. Some exact interaction solutions among different nonlinear excitations\nsuch as solitons, rational waves, periodic waves and corresponding images are\nexplicitly given.\n", "  We study theoretically and by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations\nthe generation of mechanical force by grafted polyelectrolytes in an external\nelectric field, which favors its adsorption on the grafting plane. The force\narises in deformable bodies linked to the free end of the chain. Varying the\nfield, one controls the length of the non-adsorbed part of the chain and hence\nthe deformation of the target body, i.e., the arising force too. We consider\ntarget bodies with a linear force-deformation relation and with a Hertzian one.\nWhile the first relation models a coiled Gaussian chain, the second one\ndescribes the force response of a squeezed colloidal particle. The theoretical\ndependencies of generated force and compression of the target body on applied\nfield agree very well with the results of MD simulations. The analyzed\nphenomenon may play an important role in a future nano-machinery, e.g. it may\nbe used to design nano-vices to fix nano-sized objects.\n", "  We provide a discussion of some main ideas in our project about the physical\nfoundation of the time concept in cosmology. It is standard to point to the\nPlanck scale (located at $\\sim 10^{-43}$ seconds after a fictitious \"Big Bang\"\npoint) as a limit for how far back we may extrapolate the standard cosmological\nmodel. In our work we have suggested that there are several other (physically\nmotivated) interesting limits -- located at least thirty orders of magnitude\nbefore the Planck time -- where the physical basis of the cosmological model\nand its time concept is progressively weakened. Some of these limits are\nconnected to phase transitions in the early universe which gradually undermine\nthe notion of 'standard clocks' widely employed in cosmology. Such\nconsiderations lead to a 'scale problem' for time which becomes particularly\nacute above the electroweak phase transition (before $\\sim 10^{-11}$ seconds).\nOther limits are due to problems of building up a cosmological reference frame,\nor even contemplating a sensible notion of proper time, if the early universe\nconstituents become too quantum. This 'quantum problem' for time arises e.g. if\na pure quantum phase is contemplated at the beginning of inflation at, say,\n$\\sim 10^{-34}$ seconds.\n", "  In proton-proton collisions there is a smooth transition between the regime\nof double parton scattering, initiated by two pairs of partons at a large\nrelative distance, and the regime where a single parton splits into a parton\npair in one or both protons. We present a scheme for computing both\ncontributions in a consistent and practicable way.\n", "  We are flooded with large-scale dynamic networked data. Analyses requiring\nexact comparisons between networks are computationally intractable, so new\nmethodologies are sought. We extend the graphlet-based statistics to directed\nnetworks and demonstrate that they are superior to other measures. We predict a\ncountry's gross domestic product (GDP) solely from its wiring patterns in the\nworld trade network (WTN) that could inform policy makers on benefits of trade\nagreements. Surprisingly, we find that it is not enough for a country to be in\na densely connected core in the WTN to have a high GDP, as was previously\nbelieved. In addition to being in the core, a country must also trade with\nperipheral countries, while only being in the core and not trading with\nperipheral economies makes a country prone to debt. Furthermore, by tracking\nthe dynamics of a country's positioning in the WTN over years, we predict\nsuccess or failure of an emerging economy. We validate our methodology on\nmetabolic networks, yielding insights into preservation of enzyme function from\nthe network wiring patterns rather than sequence data. Overall, our methodology\nenables advanced analyses of directed networked data from any area of science,\nallowing domain-specific interpretation of a directed network's topology.\n", "  An optical chopper periodically interrupts a classical light beam. We propose\na realizable quantum version of the optical chopper, where the time-periodic\ndriving of the light-matter coupling is achieved through a nonlinear three wave\nmixing element. We theoretically investigate how our scheme can be used for the\ncontrollable shaping of few photon light. Using Floquet dynamics, we find\nstrong periodic modulations of the transmission and reflection envelopes in the\nscattered few-photon pulses, including photon compression and blockade, as well\nas dramatic changes in the quantum light statistics. Our theoretical analysis\nallows us to explain these non-trivial phenomena as arising from non-adiabatic\nmemory effects.\n", "  The blazar 3C 279 exhibited a giant $\\gamma$-ray outburst in 2013 December\nand 2014 April. Apart from the very fast $\\gamma$-ray flux variability, the\nspectral nature of the flares were also found to vary significantly between\nthese two flaring events. A prominent curvature in the $\\gamma$-ray spectrum\nwas noticed in 2014 April flare, on the other hand, the 2013 December displayed\nan extreme hardening of the spectrum. These observations, thus, put strong\nconstraints on our understanding of the underlying particle acceleration\nmechanisms.\n", "  Beams of helium atoms in Rydberg-Stark states with principal quantum number\n$n=48$ and electric dipole moments of 4600~D have been decelerated from a mean\ninitial longitudinal speed of 2000~m/s to zero velocity in the laboratory-fixed\nframe-of-reference in the continuously moving electric traps of a\ntransmission-line decelerator. In this process accelerations up to\n$-1.3\\times10^{7}$~m/s$^2$ were applied, and changes in kinetic energy of\n$\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{kin}}=1.3\\times10^{-20}$~J ($\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{kin}}/e =\n83$~meV) per atom were achieved. Guided and decelerated atoms, and those\nconfined in stationary electrostatic traps, were detected in situ by pulsed\nelectric field ionisation. The results of numerical calculations of particle\ntrajectories within the decelerator have been used to characterise the observed\ndeceleration efficiencies, and aid in the interpretation of the experimental\ndata.\n", "  The extension of the Dirac Delta distribution (DD) to the complex field is\nneeded for dealing with the complex-energy solutions of the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation, typically when calculating their inner products. In quantum\nscattering theory the DD usually arises as an integral representation involving\nplane waves of real momenta. We deal with the complex extension of these\nrepresentations by using a Gaussian regularization. Their interpretation as\ndistributions requires prescribing the integration path and a corresponding\nspace of test functions. An extension of the Sokhotski-Plemelj formula is\nobtained. This definition of distributions is alternative to the historic one\nreferred to surface integrations on the complex plane.\n", "  In this paper we demonstrate that the alternative form, derived by us in an\nearlier paper, of the $n$-level densities for eigenvalues of matrices from the\nclassical compact group $USp(2N)$ is far better suited for comparison with\nderivations of the $n$-level densities of zeros in the family of Dirichlet\n$L$-functions associated with real quadratic characters than the traditional\ndeterminantal random matrix formula. Previous authors have found ingenious\nproofs that the leading order term of the $n$-level density of the zeros agrees\nwith the determinantal random matrix result under certain conditions, but here\nwe show that comparison is more straightforward if the more suitable form of\nthe random matrix result is used. For the support of the test function in\n$[1,-1]$ and in $[-2,2]$ we compare with existing number theoretical results.\nFor support in $[-3,3]$ no rigorous number theoretical result is known for the\n$n$-level densities, but we derive the densities here using random matrix\ntheory in the hope that this may make the path to a rigorous number theoretical\nresult clearer.\n", "  The Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) and X-ray Absorption\nSpectroscopy (XAS) database has been completely rewritten, with an improved\ndesign, user interface and a number of new tools. The database is accessible at\nhttps://eelsdb.eu/ and can now be used without registration. The submission\nprocess has been streamlined to encourage spectrum submissions and the new\ndesign gives greater emphasis on contributors original work by highlighting\ntheir papers. With numerous new filters and a powerful search function, it is\nnow simple to explore the database of several hundred of EELS and XAS spectra.\nInteractive plots allow spectra to be overlaid, facilitating online comparison.\nAn application-programming interface has been created, allowing external tools\nand software to easily access the information held within the database. In\naddition to the database itself, users can post and manage job adverts and read\nthe latest news and events regarding the EELS and XAS communities. In\naccordance with the ongoing drive towards open access data increasingly\ndemanded by funding bodies, the database will facilitate open access data\nsharing of EELS and XAS spectra.\n", "  Following Simpson we consider the integrable system structure on the moduli\nspaces of Higgs bundles on a compact K\\\"ahler manifold $X$. We propose a\ndescription of the corresponding spectral cover of $X$ as the fiberwise\nprojective dual to a hypersurface in the projectivization\n$\\mathbb{P}(\\mathcal{T}_{X} \\oplus \\mathcal{O}_X)$ of the tangent bundle\n$\\mathcal{T}_X$ to $X$. The defining equation of the hypersurface dual to the\nSimpson spectral cover is explicitly constructed in terms of the Higgs fields.\n", "  A spin-two resonance would have couplings to the SM, suppressed via\nhigher-dimensional operators. Therefore, a sizeable cross-section would\nindicate that the scale of additional new phenomena cannot be too far above the\n750 GeV mark. Below I present some theoretical arguments to place the resonance\nin a wider framework: a manifestation of new extra-dimensions, or a glueball of\na new strong sector. In each case, I identify some conditions the UV theory\nmust satisfy to accommodate other experimental bounds. Based on those, I draw\ncorrelations with associated phenomena we expect to find in future searches.\n", "  With the goal of pushing Spintronic devices towards faster and faster\ntimescales, we demonstrate, using ab-intio time-dependent density functional\ntheory simulations of bulk Heusler compounds subject to ultrashort intense\nlaser pulses, that the local magnetic moment can increase or decrease in a few\nfemtoseconds. This speed is due to the all optical nature of the process, which\ntransfers spin moment from one sublattice to another. This transfer depends on\neasily tunable laser parameters. By comparing the spin dynamics of a variety of\nHeusler (or half-Heusler) compounds, we demonstrate that the density of states\nexplains the observed moment transfer; most the physics of inter sublattice\nmoment transfer is due to the flow of spin current which is governed by\navailability of states above the Fermi level.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to answer the question whether it is possible to\nrealize simultaneously the relations $N_{\\alpha,\\beta}=-N_{-\\alpha,-\\beta}$,\n$N_{\\alpha,\\beta}=N_{\\beta,-\\alpha-\\beta}=N_{-\\alpha-\\beta,\\alpha}$ and\n$N_{\\alpha,\\beta}N_{-\\alpha,-\\beta}=-\\frac{1}{2}q(p+1)\\langle\\alpha,H_{\\alpha}\\rangle$\nby the structure constants of the Lie algebra ${\\mathfrak g}_2$. We show that\nif the structure constants obey the first relation, the three last ones are\nviolated, and vice versa. Contrary to the second case, the first one uses the\nCartan matrix elements to derive the structure constants in the form of\n$\\langle\\beta,H_{\\alpha}\\rangle$. The commutation relations corresponding to\nthe first case are exactly documented in the prior literature. However, as\nexpected, a Lie algebra isomorphism is established between the Cartan-Weyl\nbases obtained in both approaches.\n", "  We show that degenerate four-wave mixing (FWM) in nonlinear optics can be\ndescribed by an effective Hamiltonian that is pseudo-Hermitian, which enables a\ntransition between a pseudo-Hermitian phase with real eigenvalues and a broken\npseudo-Hermitian phase with complex conjugate eigenvalues. While bearing\ncertain similarity to that in Parity-Time symmetric systems, this transition is\nin stark contrast because of the absence of gain and loss in the effective\nHamiltonian. The latter is real after factoring out the system decay, and the\nonset of non-Hermiticity in degenerate FWM is due to the total phase change of\nthe signal wave and the idler wave. This property underlines the intrinsic\ncoherence in FWM, which opens the door to probe quantum implications of\nexceptional points.\n", "  Flood front is the jump interface where fluids distribute discontinuously,\nwhose interface condition is the theoretical basis of a mathematical model of\nthe multiphase flow in porous medium. The conventional interface condition at\nthe jump interface is expressed as the continuous Darcy velocity and fluid\npressure (named CPVCM). This paper has inspected it via the studying the\nwater-oil displacement in one dimensional reservoir with considering capillary\npressure but ignoring the compressibility and gravity. It is proved\ntheoretically that the total Darcy velocity and total pressure (defined by\nAntoncev etc.), instead of the Darcy velocities and pressures of water and oil,\nare continuous at the flood front without considering the compressibility of\nfluid and porous media. After that, new interface conditions for the pressures\nand Darcy velocity of each fluid are established, which are collectively named\nas Jump Pressures and Velocities Conditions Model (JPVCM) because the model has\nshown the jump pressures and jump Darcy velocities at the flood front. Finally,\nthree application-examples are proposed and the results show JPVCM is more\nreasonable than CPVCM.

We include\nirreversible effects of the vortices-defects interaction into an effective law\nof motion. The obtained current-voltage characteristic at finite temperature is\nin agreement with experimental data.\n", "  Giving up Einstein's assumption, implicit in his 1916 field equations, that\ninertial mass, even in its appearance as energy, is equivalent to active\ngravitational mass and therefore is a source of gravity allows revising the\nfield equations to a form in which a positive cosmological constant is seen to\n(mis)represent a uniform negative net mass density of gravitationally\nattractive and gravitationally repulsive matter. Field equations with both\npositive and negative active gravitational mass densities of both primordial\nand continuously created matter incorporated, along with two scalar fields to\n`relax the constraints' on the space-time geometry, yield cosmological\nsolutions that exhibit inflation, deceleration, coasting, acceleration, and a\n`big bounce' instead of a `big bang', and provide good fits to a Hubble diagram\nof type Ia supernovae data. The repulsive matter is identified as the back\nsides of the `drainholes' introduced by the author in 1973 as solutions of\nthose same field equations. Drainholes (prototypical examples of `traversable\nwormholes') are topological tunnels in space which gravitationally attract on\ntheir front, entrance sides and repel more strongly on their back, exit sides.\nThe front sides serve both as the gravitating cores of the visible, baryonic\nparticles of primordial matter and as the continuously created, invisible\nparticles of the `dark matter' needed to hold together the large scale\nstructures seen in the universe; the back sides serve as the misnamed `dark\nenergy' driving the current acceleration of the expansion of the universe.\nFormation of cosmic voids, walls, filaments, and nodes is attributed to\nexpulsion of drainhole entrances from regions populated by drainhole exits, and\naccumulation of the entrances on boundaries separating those regions.\n", "  Quantum cryptography can, in principle, provide unconditional security\nguaranteed by the law of physics only.
