close to the\ncenter of the Sun are likely to be geoeffective. Assuming that the shape of\nHCMEs is a cone and they propagate with constant angular widths and velocities,\nat least in their early phase, we have developed a technique (Michalek et al.\n2003) which allowed us to obtain the space speed, width and source location. We\napply this technique to obtain the parameters of all full HCMEs observed by the\nSolar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission's Large Angle and\nSpectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) experiment until the end of 2002. Using this\ndata we examine which parameters determine the geoeffectiveness of HCMEs. We\nshow that in the considered period of time only fast halo CMEs (with the space\nvelocities higher than $\\sim 1000{km\\over s}$ and originating from the western\nhemisphere close to the solar center could cause the severe geomagnetic storms.\nWe illustrate how the HCME parameters can be used for space weather forecast.\nIt is also demonstrated that the strength of a geomagnetic storm does not\ndepend on the determined width of HCMEs. This means that HCMEs do not have to\nbe very large to cause major geomagnetic storms.\n", "  Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations are observed in Bi2Se3 flakes with high\ncarrier concentration and low bulk mobility. These oscillations probe the\nprotected surface states and enable us to extract their carrier concentration,\neffective mass and Dingle temperature. The Fermi momentum obtained is in\nagreement with angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements\nperformed on crystals from the same batch. We study the behavior of the Berry\nphase as a function of magnetic field. The standard theoretical considerations\nfail to explain the observed behavior.\n", "  We obtain analytically the exact non-retarded dispersive interaction energy\nbetween an atom and a perfectly conducting disc. We consider the atom in the\nsymmetry axis of the disc and assume the atom is predominantly polarizable in\nthe direction of this axis. For this situation we discuss the finite size\neffects on the corresponding interaction energy. We follow the recent procedure\nintroduced by Eberlein and Zietal together with the old and powerful\nSommerfeld's image method for non-trivial geometries. For the sake of clarity\nwe present a detailed discussion of Sommerfeld's image method. Comparing our\nresults form the atom-disc system with those recently obtained for an atom near\na conducting plane with a circular aperture, we discus the non-additivity of\nthe van der Waals interactions involving an atom and two complementary\nsurfaces. We show that there is a given ratio z/a between the distance z from\nthe atom to the center of the disc (aperture) and the radius of the disc a\n(aperture) for which non-additivity effects vanish. Qualitative arguments\nsuggest that this quite unexpected result will occur not only for a circular\nhole, but for anyother symmetric hole.\n", "  We introduce the new algebraic property of Weyl compatibility for symmetric\ntensors and vectors. It is strictly related to Riemann compatibility, which\ngeneralizes the Codazzi condition while preserving much of its geometric\nimplications. In particular it is shown that the existence of a Weyl compatible\nvector implies the Weyl tensor to be algebraically special, and it is a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the magnetic part to vanish. Some\ntheorems (Derdzinski and Shen, Hall) are extended to the broader hypothesis of\nWeyl or Riemann compatibility. Weyl compatibility includes conditions that were\ninvestigated in the literature of general relativity (as McIntosh et al.).\nHypersurfaces of pseudo Euclidean spaces provide a simple example of Weyl\ncompatible Ricci tensor.\n", "  We consider a magnetic impurity deposited on the surface of a strong\ntopological insulator and interacting with the surface modes by a Kondo\nexchange interaction. Taking into account the warping of the Fermi line of the\nsurface modes, we derive a mapping to an effective one dimensional model and\nshow that the impurity is fully screened by the surface electrons except when\nthe Fermi level lies exactly at the Dirac point. Using an Abrikosov fermion\nmean-field theory, we calculate the shape of the electronic density Friedel\noscillation resulting from the presence of the Kondo screening cloud. We\nanalyze quantitatively the observability of a six-fold symmetry in the Friedel\noscillations for two prototype compounds: Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Bi$_2$Te$_3$.\n", "  The existence of a decoherence-free subspace/subsystem (DFS) requires that\nthe noise possesses a symmetry. In this work we consider noise models in which\nperturbations break this symmetry, so that the DFS for the unperturbed model\nexperiences noise. We ask whether in this case there exist subspaces/subsystems\nthat have less noise than the original DFS. We develop a numerical method to\nsearch for such minimal noise subsystems and apply it to a number of examples.\nFor the examples we examine, we find that if the perturbation is local noise\nthen there is no better subspace/subsystem than the original DFS. We also show\nthat if the noise model remains collective, but is perturbed in a way that\nbreaks the symmetry, then the minimal noise subsystem is distinct from the\noriginal DFS, and improves upon it.\n", "  We present a framework for computing averages of various observables of\nMacdonald processes. This leads to new contour--integral formulas for averages\nof a large class of multilevel observables, as well as Fredholm determinants\nfor averages of two different single level observables.\n", "  The paper considers a model for Bose gases in the so-called 'high-temperature\nrange' below the temperature Tc, where Bose-Einstein condensation sets in.The\nmodel is of non-linear two-component type, consisting of a kinetic equation\nwith periodic boundary conditions for the distribution function of a gas of\nexcitations interacting with a Bose condensate, which is described by a\nGross-Pitaevskii equation. Results on well-posedness and long time behaviour\nare proved in a H1-setting close to equilibrium.\n", "  Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to study the formation\nprocess of nanopores in a suspended graphene sheet irradiated by using\nenergetic ions though a mask. By controlling the ion parameters including mass,\nenergy and incident angle, different kinds of topography were observed in the\ngraphene sheet. Net-like defective strucutures with carbon atom chains can be\nformed at low ion fluence, which provides the possibility to functionalize the\nirradiated sample with subsequent chemical methods; finally a perfect nanopore\nwith smooth edge appears as the ion fluence is high enough. We found that the\ndependence of ion damage efficiency on ion fluence, energy and incident angle\nare different from that predicted by the semi-empirical model based on the\nbinary-collision approximation, which results from the special structure of\ngraphene. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to fabricate controlled\nnanopores/nanostructures in graphene via heavy ion irradiation.\n", "  PolarBase is an evolving data base that contains all stellar data collected\nwith the ESPaDOnS and NARVAL high-resolution spectropolarimeters, in their\nreduced form, as soon as they become public. As of early 2014, observations of\n2,000 stellar objects throughout the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram are available.\nIntensity spectra are available for all targets, and the majority of the\nobservations also include simultaneous spectra in circular or linear\npolarization, with the majority of the polarimetric measurements being\nperformed only in circularly polarized light (Stokes V). Observations are\nassociated with a cross-correlation pseudo-line profile in all available Stokes\nparameters, greatly increasing the detectability of weak polarized signatures.\nStokes V signatures are detected for more than 300 stars of all masses and\nevolutionary stages, and linear polarization is detected in 35 targets. The\ndetection rate in Stokes V is found to be anti-correlated with the stellar\neffective temperature. This unique set of Zeeman detections offers the first\nopportunity to run homogeneous magnetometry studies throughout the H-R diagram.\nThe web interface of PolarBase is available at http://polarbase.irap.omp.eu.\n", "  We consider an elliptic self-adjoint first order differential operator L\nacting on pairs (2-columns) of complex-valued half-densities over a connected\ncompact 3-dimensional manifold without boundary. The principal symbol of the\noperator L is assumed to be trace-free and the subprincipal symbol is assumed\nto be zero. Given a positive scalar weight function, we study the weighted\neigenvalue problem for the operator L. The corresponding counting function\n(number of eigenvalues between zero and a positive lambda) is known to admit,\nunder appropriate assumptions on periodic trajectories, a two-term asymptotic\nexpansion as lambda tends to plus infinity and we have recently derived an\nexplicit formula for the second asymptotic coefficient. The purpose of this\npaper is to establish the geometric meaning of the second asymptotic\ncoefficient. To this end, we identify the geometric objects encoded within our\neigenvalue problem - metric, nonvanishing spinor field and topological charge -\nand express our asymptotic coefficients in terms of these geometric objects. We\nprove that the second asymptotic coefficient of the counting function has the\ngeometric meaning of the massless Dirac action.\n", "  We introduce multilevel versions of Dyson Brownian motions of arbitrary\nparameter $\\beta>0$, generalizing the interlacing reflected Brownian motions of\nWarren for $\\beta=2$. Such processes unify $\\beta$ corners processes and Dyson\nBrownian motions in a single object. Our approach is based on the approximation\nby certain multilevel discrete Markov chains of independent interest, which are\ndefined by means of Jack symmetric polynomials. In particular, this approach\nallows to show that the levels in a multilevel Dyson Brownian motion are\nintertwined (at least for $\\beta\\ge 1$) and to give the corresponding link\nexplicitly.\n", "  Antiferromagnetic correlations have been argued to be the cause of the d-wave\nsuperconductivity and the pseudogap phenomena exhibited by the cuprates.\nAlthough the antiferromagnetic response in the pseudogap state has been\nreported for a number of compounds, there exists no information for\nstructurally simple HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\\delta}$. Here we report neutron scattering\nresults for HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\\delta}$ (superconducting transition temperature\nT$_c$ $\\sim$ 71 K, pseudogap temperature T* $\\sim$ 305 K) that demonstrate the\nabsence of the two most prominent features of the magnetic excitation spectrum\nof the cuprates: the X-shaped 'hourglass' response and the resonance mode in\nthe superconducting state. Instead, the response is Y-shaped, gapped, and\nsignificantly enhanced below T*, and hence a prominent signature of the\npseudogap state.\n", "  Within the quantum phase representation we derive Heisenberg limits, in\nclosed form, for N00N states and two other classes of states that can perform\nbetter in terms of local performance metrics relevant for multiply-peaked\ndistributions. One of these can also enhance the super-resolution factor beyond\nthat of a N00N state of the same power, at the expense of diminished fringe\nvisibility. An accurate phase estimation algorithm, which can be applied to the\nminimally resourced apparatus of a standard interferometer, is shown to be\nresilient to the presence of additive white-Gaussian noise (AWGN). In the limit\nof no AWGN the algorithm achieves over nine digits of accuracy for the case of\na four-photon N00N state - orders of magnitude below its Heisenberg limit.\n", "  Results obtained several years ago using the high-resolution 93.3 keV\nM\\\"ossbauer resonance in $^{67}$ZnO and $\\beta'$-brass have been reanalyzed\nwith the notion that the clock hypothesis of Special Relativity Theory is not\nsufficient, but that a maximal acceleration $a_m$ exists and that an\nacceleration $a$ contributes to the temperature dependence of the center shift\nby a term $\\pm(1/2)(a/a_m)^2$. The significance of the sign of this term is\ndiscussed in detail. For both substances a lower limit of\n$a_m>1.5\\cdot10^{21}m/s^2$ is inferred which is more than two orders of\nmagnitude larger than the value $a_m=1\\cdot10^{19}m/s^2$ suggested by $^{57}$Fe\nrotor experiments.\n", "  We present the results of the atmospheric optical turbulence (OT)\nmeasurements performed atop Mt. Shatdzhatmaz at the installation site of new\n2.5-m telescope of Sternberg Astronomical Institute. Nearly 300 000 vertical OT\nprofiles from the ground up to an altitude of 23 km were obtained in the period\nNovember 2007 - June 2013 with the combined multi-aperture scintillation sensor\n(MASS) and differential image motion monitor (DIMM) instrument.\n  The medians of the main OT characteristics computed over the whole dataset\nare as follows: the integral seeing $\\beta_0 = 0.96$ arcsec, the\nfree-atmosphere seeing $\\beta_{free} = 0.43$ arcsec, and the isoplanatic angle\n$\\theta_0 = 2.07$ arcsec. The median atmospheric time constant is $\\tau_0 =\n6.57 \\mbox{ ms}$. The revealed long-term variability of these parameters on\nscales of months and years implies the need to take it into account in\nastroclimatic campaign planning. For example, the annual variation in the\nmonthly $\\theta_0$ estimate amounts up to 30% while the time constant $\\tau_0$\nchanges by a factor of 2.5.\n  Evaluation of the potential of Mt. Shatdzhatmaz in terms of high angular\nresolution observations indicates that in October--November, this site is as\ngood as the best of studied summits in the world.\n", "  We discuss the ongoing development of single-mode fiber Fabry-Perot (FFP)\nInterferometers as precise astro-photonic calibration sources for high\nprecision radial velocity (RV) spectrographs. FFPs are simple, inexpensive,\nmonolithic units that can yield a stable and repeatable output spectrum. An FFP\nis a unique alternative to a traditional etalon, as the interferometric cavity\nis made of single-mode fiber rather than an air-gap spacer. This design allows\nfor excellent collimation, high spectral finesse, rigid mechanical stability,\ninsensitivity to vibrations, and no need for vacuum operation. The device we\nhave tested is a commercially available product from Micron Optics. Our\ndevelopment path is targeted towards a calibration source for the\nHabitable-Zone Planet Finder (HPF), a near-infrared spectrograph designed to\ndetect terrestrial-mass planets around low-mass stars, but this reference could\nalso be used in many existing and planned fiber-fed spectrographs as we\nillustrate using the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment\n(APOGEE) instrument. With precise temperature control of the fiber etalon, we\nachieve a thermal stability of 100 $\\mu$K and associated velocity uncertainty\nof 22 cm s$^{-1}$. We achieve a precision of $\\approx$2 m s$^{-1}$ in a single\nAPOGEE fiber over 12 hours using this new photonic reference after removal of\nsystematic correlations. This high precision (close to the expected\nphoton-limited floor) is a testament to both the excellent intrinsic wavelength\nstability of the fiber interferometer and the stability of the APOGEE\ninstrument design. Overall instrument velocity precision is 80 cm s$^{-1}$ over\n12 hours when averaged over all 300 APOGEE fibers and after removal of known\ntrends and pressure correlations, implying the fiber etalon is intrinsically\nstable to significantly higher precision.\n", "  The radio pulse from a pulsar can be temporally broadened by multipath\nscattering in the interstellar medium and by instrumental effects within the\nradio telescope. The observed pulse shape is a convolution of the intrinsic one\nwith the impulse responses of the scattering medium and instrumentation. Until\nrecently, common methods used to model the observed shape make assumptions\nregarding the intrinsic pulse shape and impulse responses, compute the\nconvolution numerically, and solve for the pulse width and scattering timescale\niteratively. An analytical solution is shown to exist for the specific case of\nthe temporal broadening of a Gaussian-shaped pulse by a thin scattering screen.\nThe solution is applied to multi-frequency observations of PSR B1834-10 to\ncharacterize the frequency dependence of its intrinsic pulse width and\nscattering timescale.\n", "  We revisit the exquisite archival radio data for the Type Ic supernova SN\n1994I and present a revised model for the SN radio emission and a pilot study\nthat aims to constrain the rate of C-band radio transients within the face-on\nhost galaxy, M51 (NGC 5194). We find that the temporal and spectral evolution\nof the SN\\,1994I radio emission are well fit by a synchrotron self-absorption\nmodel and use this to estimate physical parameters. We compute a pre-explosion\nmass loss rate of $\\dot{M}=3.0 \\times 10^{-5} M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for the\nprogenitor, consistent with those observed from galactic Wolf-Rayet stars. Our\nmodel makes different assumptions for the dynamical model for the shockwave\ninteraction than the model previously published by \\cite{weil11}, but our\n$\\dot{M}$ is consistent with theirs to within errors and assumptions. Drawing\nfrom a subset of the archival radio observations from the Very Large Array\ncollected for the monitoring of SN\\,1994I, we conduct a pilot study to search\nfor previously-unidentified transients. Data were primarily taken at a\nfrequency of 4.9 GHz and are logarithmic in cadence, enabling sensitivity to\ntransients with variability timescales ranging from days to months. We find no\nnew transient detections in 31 epochs of data, allowing us to place a $2\\sigma$\nupper limit of 17 deg$^{-2}$ for the source density of radio transients above\n0.5 mJy ($L\\gtrsim4\\times10^{25}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ at the distance of\nM51). This study highlights the feasibility of utilizing archival high-cadence\nradio studies of supernova host galaxies to place constraints on the radio\ntransient rate as a function of luminosity in the local Universe.\n", "  This paper reports result of calculation and experimental realization of an\nelectromechanical system that consists of a high-Q mechanical oscillator\nparametrically coupled in the manner of a capacitive transducer with a RF\ncircuit, which is in turn inductively coupled with another RF circuit. The\nsystem operates in the resolved sideband regime when the mechanical\noscillator's frequency is larger than the electrical circuits' bandwidths.\nUsing two coupled RF circuits allowed one to enhance the interaction between\nthem and the mechanical oscillator which is one of flexural vibrational modes\nof a free-edge circular silicon wafer. Such a coupled electromechanical system\ncan be used as a high-sensitive capacitive vibration sensor.\n", "  We used Bayesian methods to compare the predictions of probabilistic risk\nassessment -- the theoretical tool used by the nuclear industry to predict the\nfrequency of nuclear accidents -- with empirical data. The existing record of\naccidents with some simplifying assumptions regarding their probability\ndistribution is sufficient to rule out the validity of the industry's analyses\nat a very high confidence level. We show that this conclusion is robust against\nany reasonable assumed variation of safety standards over time, and across\nregions. The debate on nuclear liability indicates that the industry has\nindependently arrived at this conclusion. We pay special attention to the\nIndian situation, where we show that the existing operating experience provides\ninsufficient data to make any reliable claims about the safety of future\nreactors. We briefly discuss some policy implications.\n", "  Fourier-domain Difference Map (FDM) for phase retrieval with two oversampled\ncoded diffraction patterns are proposed. FDM is a 3-parameter family of fixed\npoint algorithms including Fourier-domain Hybrid-Projection-Reflection (FHPR)\nand Douglas-Rachford (FDR) algorithm. For generic complex objects without any\nobject constraint, FDM yields a unique fixed point, after proper projection\nback to the object domain, which is the true solution to the phase retrieval\nproblem up to a global phase factor.\n", "  The causal dynamical triangulations approach aims to construct a quantum\ntheory of gravity as the continuum limit of a lattice-regularized model of\ndynamical geometry. A renormalization group scheme--in concert with finite size\nscaling analysis--is essential to this aim. Formulating and implementing such a\nscheme in the present context raises novel and notable conceptual and technical\nproblems. I explored these problems, and, building on standard techniques,\nsuggested potential solutions in the first paper of this two-part series. As an\napplication of these solutions, I now propose a renormalization group scheme\nfor causal dynamical triangulations. This scheme differs significantly from\nthat studied recently by Ambjorn, Gorlich, Jurkiewicz, Kreienbuehl, and Loll.\n", "  We construct a tangent bundle exponential map and locally autoparallel\ncoordinates for geometries based on a general connection on the tangent bundle\nof a manifold. As concrete application we use these new coordinates for\nFinslerian geometries and obtain Finslerian geodesic coordinates. They\ngeneralise normal coordinates known from metric geometry to Finsler geometric\nmanifolds and it turns out that they are identical to the Douglas-Thomas normal\ncoordinates introduced earlier. We expand the fundamental geometry function of\na Finsler spacetime in these new coordinates and find that it is constant to\nquadratic order. The quadratic order term comes with the non-linear curvature\nof the manifold. From physics these coordinates may be interpretation as the\nrealisation of an Einstein elevator in Finslerian spacetime geometries.\n", "  Quantification of symmetries in complex networks is typically done globally\nin terms of automorphisms. Extending previous methods to locally assess the\nsymmetry of nodes is not straightforward. Here we present a new framework to\nquantify the symmetries around nodes, which we call connectivity patterns. We\ndevelop two topological transformations that allow a concise characterization\nof the different types of symmetry appearing on networks and apply these\nconcepts to six network models, namely the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi,\nBarab\\'asi-Albert, random geometric graph, Waxman, Voronoi and rewired Voronoi.\nReal-world networks, namely the scientific areas of Wikipedia, the world-wide\nairport network and the street networks of Oldenburg and San Joaquin, are also\nanalyzed in terms of the proposed symmetry measurements. Several interesting\nresults emerge from this analysis, including the high symmetry exhibited by the\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi model. Additionally, we found that the proposed measurements\npresent low correlation with other traditional metrics, such as node degree and\nbetweenness centrality. Principal component analysis is used to combine all the\nresults, revealing that the concepts presented here have substantial potential\nto also characterize networks at a global scale.\n", "  We find evidence that low-OSNR operation causes substantial penalty on system\nmaximum reach due to non-linearity generated by ASE noise and due to\nsignal-power conversion into non-linear noise. Neglecting these effects may\nlead to a quite substantial performance prediction error.\n", "  Micron-sized particles moving through solution in response to self-generated\nchemical gradients serve as model systems for studying active matter. Their\nfar-reaching potential applications will require the particles to sense and\nrespond to their local environment in a robust manner. The self-generated\nhydrodynamic and chemical fields, which induce particle motion, probe and are\nmodified by that very environment, including confining boundaries. Focusing on\na catalytically active Janus particle as a paradigmatic example, we predict\nthat near a hard planar wall such a particle exhibits several scenarios of\nmotion: reflection from the wall, motion at a steady-state orientation and\nheight above the wall, or motionless, steady \"hovering.\" Concerning the steady\nstates, the height and the orientation are determined both by the proportion of\ncatalyst coverage and the interactions of the solutes with the different\n\"faces\" of the particle. Accordingly, we propose that a desired behavior can be\nselected by tuning these parameters via a judicious design of the particle\nsurface chemistry.\n", "  We present a theoretical analysis of the intensity autocorrelation for the\nspontaneous emission from a planar ensemble of self-assembled quantum dots.\nUsing the quantum jump approach, we numerically simulate the evolution of the\nsystem and construct photon-photon delay time statistics that approximates the\nsecond order correlation function of the field. The form of this correlation\nfunction in the case of collective emission from a highly homogeneous ensemble\nqualitatively differs form that characterizing an ensemble of independent\nemitters (inhomogeneous ensemble of uncoupled dots). The signatures of\ncollective emission in the intensity correlations are observed also in the case\nof an inhomogeneous but sufficiently strongly coupled ensemble. Thus, we show\nthat the second order correlation function of the emitted field provides a\nsensitive test of cooperative effects.\n", "  Inspired by the work done by Belavkin [Belavkin V. P., Stochastics, 1, 315\n(1975)], and independently by Mochon, [Phys. Rev. A 73, 032328, (2006)], we\nformulate the problem of minimum error discrimination of any ensemble of $n$\nlinearly independent pure states by stripping the problem of its rotational\ncovariance and retaining only the rotationally invariant aspect of the problem.\nThis is done by embedding the optimal conditions in a matrix equality as well\nas matrix inequality. Employing the implicit function theorem in these\nconditions we get a set of first-order coupled ordinary non-linear differential\nequations which can be used to drag the solution from an initial point (where\nsolution is known) to another point (whose solution is sought). This way of\nobtaining the solution can be done through a simple Taylor series expansion and\nanalytic continuation when required. Thus, we \\emph{complete} the work done by\nBelavkin and Mochon by ultimately leading their theory to a solution for the\nminimum error discrimination problem of linearly independent pure state\nensembles. We also compare the computational complexity of our technique with a\nbarrier-type interior point method of SDP and show that our technique is\ncomputationally as efficient as (actually, a bit more than) the SDP algorithm,\nwith the added advantage of being much simpler to implement.\n", "  We propose a new type of experimentally feasible quantum quench protocol in\nwhich a quantum system is prepared in a coherent, localized excited state of a\nHamiltonian. During the evolution of this solitonic excitation, the microscopic\ninteraction is suddenly changed. We study the dynamics of solitons after this\ninteraction quench for a wide class of systems using a hydrodynamic approach.\nWe find that the post-quench dynamics is universal at short times, i.e. it does\nnot depend on the microscopic details of the physical system. Numerical support\nfor these results is presented using generalized non-linear Schroedinger\nequation, relevant for the implementation of the proposed protocol with\nultracold bosons, as well as for the integrable Calogero model in harmonic\npotential. Finally, it is shown that the effects of integrability breaking by a\nparabolic potential and by a power-law non-linearity do not change the\nuniversality of the short-time dynamics.\n", "  Linear polarization measurements provide access to two quantities, the degree\n(DOP) and the angle of polarization (AOP). The aim of this work is to give a\ncomplete and concise overview of how to analyze polarimetric measurements. We\nreview interval estimations for the DOP with a frequentist and a Bayesian\napproach. Point estimations for the DOP and interval estimations for the AOP\nare further investigated with a Bayesian approach to match observational needs.\nPoint and interval estimations are calculated numerically for frequentist and\nBayesian statistics. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to clarify the\nmeaning of the calculations.\n  Under observational conditions, the true DOP and AOP are unknown, so that\nclassical statistical considerations - based on true values - are not directly\nusable. In contrast, Bayesian statistics handles unknown true values very well\nand produces point and interval estimations for DOP and AOP, directly. Using a\nBayesian approach, we show how to choose DOP point estimations based on the\nmeasured signal-to-noise ratio. Interval estimations for the DOP show great\ndifferences in the limit of low signal-to-noise ratios between the classical\nand Bayesian approach. AOP interval estimations that are based on observational\ndata are presented for the first time. All results are directly usable via\nplots and parametric fits.\n", "  We study the complete gravitational collapse of a class of spherically\nsymmetric inhomogeneous perfect fluid models obtained by introducing small\nradial perturbations in an otherwise homogeneous matter cloud. Our aim here is\nto study the genericity and stability of the formation of black holes and\nlocally naked singularities in collapse. While the occurrence of naked\nsingularities is known for many models of collapse, the key issue now in focus\nis genericity and stability of these outcomes. Towards this purpose, we study\nhow the introduction of a somewhat general class of small inhomogeneities in\nhomogeneous collapse leading to a black hole can change the final outcome to a\nnaked singularity. The key feature that we assume for the perturbation profile\nis that of a mass profile that is separable in radial and temporal coordinates.\nThe known models of dust and homogeneous perfect fluid collapse can be obtained\nfrom this choice of the mass profile as special cases. This choice is very\ngeneral and physically well motivated and we show that this class of collapse\nmodels leads to the formation of a naked singularity as the final state.\n", "  In this work we present a quantum key distribution protocol using\ncontinuous-variable non-Gaussian states, homodyne detection and post-selection.\nThe employed signal states are the Photon Added then Subtracted Coherent States\n(PASCS) in which one photon is added and subsequently one photon is subtracted.\nWe analyze the performance of our protocol, compared to a coherent state based\nprotocol, for two different attacks that could be carried out by the\neavesdropper (Eve). We calculate the secret key rate transmission in a lossy\nline for a superior channel (beam-splitter) attack, and we show that we may\nincrease the secret key generation rate by using the non-Gaussian PASCS rather\nthan coherent states. We also consider the simultaneous quadrature measurement\n(intercept-resend) attack and we show that the efficiency of Eve's attack is\nsubstantially reduced if PASCS are used as signal states.\n", "  The anisotropy of the electronic transition is an important physical property\nnot only determining the materials' optical property, but also revealing the\nunderlying character of the electronic states involved. Here we used\nmomentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy to study the evolution of\nthe anisotropy of the electronic transition involving the low energy valence\nelectrons in the free-standing MoS2 systems as the layer thickness was reduced\nto monolayer. We used the orientation and the spectral-density analysis to show\nthat indirect to direct band-gap transition is accompanied by a three- to\ntwo-dimensional anisotropy cross-over. The result provides a logical\nexplanation for the large sensitivity of indirect transition to the change of\nthickness compared with that for direct transition. By tracking the energy of\nindirect transition, we also revealed the asymmetric response of the valence\nband and conduction band to the quantum confinement effect. Our results have\nimplication for future optoelectronic applications of atomic thin MoS2.\n", "  Magnetically confined winds of early-type stars are expected to be sources of\nbright and hard X-rays. To clarify the systematics of the observed X-ray\nproperties, we have analyzed a large series of Chandra and XMM observations,\ncorresponding to all available exposures of known massive magnetic stars (over\n100 exposures covering ~60% of stars compiled in the catalog of Petit et al.\n2013). We show that the X-ray luminosity is strongly correlated with the\nstellar wind mass-loss-rate, with a power-law form that is slightly steeper\nthan linear for the majority of the less luminous, lower-Mdot B stars and\nflattens for the more luminous, higher-Mdot O stars. As the winds are\nradiatively driven, these scalings can be equivalently written as relations\nwith the bolometric luminosity. The observed X-ray luminosities, and their\ntrend with mass-loss rates, are well reproduced by new MHD models, although a\nfew overluminous stars (mostly rapidly rotating objects) exist. No relation is\nfound between other X-ray properties (plasma temperature, absorption) and\nstellar or magnetic parameters, contrary to expectations (e.g. higher\ntemperature for stronger mass-loss rate). This suggests that the main driver\nfor the plasma properties is different from the main determinant of the X-ray\nluminosity. Finally, variations of the X-ray hardnesses and luminosities, in\nphase with the stellar rotation period, are detected for some objects and they\nsuggest some temperature stratification to exist in massive stars'\nmagnetospheres.\n", "  The aim of the causal dynamical triangulations approach is to define\nnonperturbatively a quantum theory of gravity as the continuum limit of a\nlattice-regularized model of dynamical geometry. My aim in this paper is to\ngive a concise yet comprehensive, impartial yet personal presentation of the\ncausal dynamical triangulations approach.\n", "  There are two proposals that compute holographic entanglement entropy in\nAdS$_3$ higher spin theories based on $SL(N,\\mathbb{R})$ Chern-Simons theory.\nWe show explicitly that these two proposals are equivalent. We also designed\ntwo methods that solve systematically the equations for arbitrary $N$. For\nfinite charge backgrounds in AdS$_3$, we find exact agreement between our\nexpressions and the short interval correction of the entanglement entropy for\nan excited state in a CFT$_2$.\n", "  This paper examines detection prospects and constraints on the chromomagnetic\ndipole operator for the bottom quark. This operator has a flavor, chirality and\nLorentz structure that is distinct from other dimension six operators\nconsidered in Higgs coupling studies. Its non-standard Lorentz structure\nbolsters boosted $b \\bar{b} h$ events, providing a rate independent signal of\nnew physics. To date, we find this operator is unconstrained by $p p\n\\rightarrow h + {\\rm jets}$ and $pp \\rightarrow \\bar b b $ searches: for\norder-one couplings the permitted cutoff $\\Lambda$ for this operator can be as\nlow as $\\Lambda \\sim 1~{\\rm TeV}$. We show how to improve this bound with\ncollider cuts that allow a $b$-tagged Higgs plus dijet search in the Higgs to\ndiphoton decay channel to exclude cutoffs as high as $\\sim 6~{\\rm TeV}$ at $2\n\\sigma$ with 3 $\\text{ab}^{-1}$ of luminosity at the 14 TeV LHC. Cuts on the\n$p_T$ of the Higgs are key to this search, because the chromomagnetic dipole\nyields a non-standard fraction of boosted Higgses.\n", "  The conventional picture of the light amplification by stimulated emission of\nradiation (laser) is broken under the ultrastrong interaction between the\nelectromagnetic fields and matter, and distinct dynamics of the electric field\nand of the magnetic one make the \"laser\" qualitatively different from the\nconventional laser, which has been described simply without the distinction.\nThe \"laser\" in the ultrastrong regime can show a rich variety of behaviors with\nspontaneous appearance of coherence. We found that the \"laser\" generally\naccompanies odd-order harmonics of the electromagnetic fields both inside and\noutside the cavity and a synchronization with an oscillation of atomic\npopulation. A bistability is also demonstrated in a simple model under\ntwo-level and single-mode approximations.\n", "  It is shown theoretically that a one-dimensional crystal with time reversal\nsymmetry is characterized by a Z_{2} topological invariant that predicts the\nexistence or otherwise of edge states. This is confirmed experimentally through\nthe construction and simulation of a photonic crystal analogue in the microwave\nregime.\n", "  Time evolution of electromagnetic field created in heavy-ion collisions\nstrongly depends on the electromagnetic response of the quark-gluon plasma,\nwhich can be described by the Ohmic and chiral conductivities. The later is\nintimately related to the Chiral Magnetic Effect. I argue that a solution to\nthe classical Maxwell equations at finite chiral conductivity is unstable due\nto the soft modes $k<\\sigma_\\chi$ that grow exponentially with time. In the\nkinematical region relevant for the relativistic heavy-ion collisions, I derive\nanalytical expressions for the magnetic field of a point charge. I show that\nfinite chiral conductivity causes oscillations of magnetic field at early\ntimes.\n", "  We have used the Wide Field Spectrograph on the Australian National\nUniversity 2.3-m telescope to perform the integral field spectroscopy for a\nsample of the Galactic planetary nebulae. The spatially resolved velocity\ndistributions of the H$\\alpha$ emission line were used to determine the\nkinematic features and nebular orientations. Our findings show that some bulge\nplanetary nebulae toward the Galactic center have a particular orientation.\n", "  For the Warm Dark Matter (WDM) candidates the momentum distribution of\nparticles becomes important, since it can be probed with observations of\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest structures and confronted with coarse grained phase space\ndensity in galaxy clusters. We recall the calculation bt Kaplinghat (2005) of\nthe spectrum in case of dark matter non-thermal production in decays of heavy\nparticles emphasizing on the inherent applicability conditions, which are\nrather restrictive and sometimes ignored in literature. Cold part of the\nspectrum requires special care when WDM is considered.\n", "  Analog forecasting is a nonparametric technique introduced by Lorenz in 1969\nwhich predicts the evolution of states of a dynamical system (or observables\ndefined on the states) by following the evolution of the sample in a historical\nrecord of observations which most closely resembles the current initial data.\nHere, we introduce a suite of forecasting methods which improve traditional\nanalog forecasting by combining ideas from kernel methods developed in harmonic\nanalysis and machine learning and state-space reconstruction for dynamical\nsystems. A key ingredient of our approach is to replace single-analog\nforecasting with weighted ensembles of analogs constructed using local\nsimilarity kernels. The kernels used here employ a number of dynamics-dependent\nfeatures designed to improve forecast skill, including Takens' delay-coordinate\nmaps (to recover information in the initial data lost through partial\nobservations) and a directional dependence on the dynamical vector field\ngenerating the data. Mathematically, our approach is closely related to kernel\nmethods for out-of-sample extension of functions, and we discuss alternative\nstrategies based on the Nystr\\\"om method and the multiscale Laplacian pyramids\ntechnique. We illustrate these techniques in applications to forecasting in a\nlow-order deterministic model for atmospheric dynamics with chaotic\nmetastability, and interannual-scale forecasting in the North Pacific sector of\na comprehensive climate model. We find that forecasts based on kernel-weighted\nensembles have significantly higher skill than the conventional approach\nfollowing a single analog.\n", "  A vortex in Bose-Einstein condensates is a localized object which looks much\nlike a tiny tornado storm. It is well described by mean-field theory. In the\npresent work we go beyond the current paradigm and introduce many-body\nvortices. These are made of {\\it spatially-partitioned} clouds, carry definite\ntotal angular momentum, and are fragmented rather than condensed objects which\ncan only be described beyond mean-field theory. A phase diagram based on a\nmean-field model assists in predicting the parameters where many-body vortices\noccur. Implications are briefly discussed.\n", "  Processes producing a charged final state at the LHC have a positive integral\ncharge asymmetry. We propose a novel method for an indirect measurement of the\nmass of these final states based upon the process integral charge asymmetry.\nFirst, the theoretical prediction of the integral charge asymmetry and its\nrelated uncertainties are studied through parton level cross sections\ncalculations. Then, the experimental extraction of the integral charge\nasymmetry of a given signal, in the presence of some background, is performed\nusing particle level simulations. Process dependent templates enable to convert\nthe measured integral charge asymmetry into an estimated mass of the charged\nfinal state. Finally, a combination of the experimental and the theoretical\nuncertainties determines the full uncertainty of the indirect mass measurement.\nThis new method applies to all charged current processes at the LHC. In this\narticle, we demonstrate its effectiveness at extracting the mass of the W\nboson, as a first step, and the sum of the masses of a chargino and a\nneutralino in case these supersymmetric particles are produced by pair, as a\nsecond step.\n", "  We analytically study momentum-space entanglement in quantum spin-half\nladders consisting of two coupled critical XXZ spin-half chains using field\ntheoretical methods. When the system is gapped, the momentum-space entanglement\nHamiltonian is described by a conformal field theory with a central charge of\ntwo. This is in contrast to entanglement Hamiltonians of various real-space\npartitions of gapped-spin ladders that have a central charge of one. When the\nsystem is gapless, we interestingly find that the entanglement Hamiltonian\nconsist of one gapless mode linear in subsystem momentum and one mode with a\nflat dispersion relation. We also find that the momentum-space entanglement\nentropy obeys a volume law.\n", "  The discovery of many planets using the Kepler telescope includes ten planets\norbiting eight binary stars. Three binaries, Kepler-16, Kepler-47, and\nKepler-453, have at least one planet in the circumbinary habitable-zone (BHZ).\nWe constrain the level of high-energy radiation and the plasma environment in\nthe BHZ of these systems. With this aim, BHZ limits in these Kepler binaries\nare calculated as a function of time, and the habitability lifetimes are\nestimated for hypothetical terrestrial planets and/or moons within the BHZ.\nWith the time-dependent BHZ limits established, a self-consistent model is\ndeveloped describing the evolution of stellar activity and radiation properties\nas proxies for stellar aggression toward planetary atmospheres. Modeling binary\nstellar rotation evolution, including the effect of tidal interaction between\nstars in binaries is key to establishing the environment around these systems.\nWe find that Kepler-16 and its binary analogs provide a plasma environment\nfavorable for the survival of atmospheres of putative Mars-sized planets and\nexomoons. Tides have modified the rotation of the stars in Kepler-47 making its\nradiation environment less harsh in comparison to the solar system. This is a\ngood example of the mechanism first proposed by Mason et al. Kepler-453 has an\nenvironment similar to that of the solar system with slightly better than Earth\nradiation conditions at the inner edge of the BHZ. These results can be\nreproduced and even reparametrized as stellar evolution and binary tidal models\nprogress, using our online tool http://bhmcalc.net.\n", "  We have designed a fiber scrambler as a prototype for the Keck HIRES\nspectrograph, using double scrambling to stabilize illumination of the\nspectrometer and a pupil slicer to increase spectral resolution to R = 70,000\nwith minimal slit losses. We find that the spectral line spread function (SLSF)\nfor the double scrambler observations is 18 times more stable than the SLSF for\ncomparable slit observations and 9 times more stable than the SLSF for a single\nfiber scrambler that we tested in 2010. For the double scrambler test data, we\nfurther reduced the radial velocity scatter from an average of 2.1 m/s to 1.5\nm/s after adopting a median description of the stabilized SLSF in our Doppler\nmodel. This demonstrates that inaccuracies in modeling the SLSF contribute to\nthe velocity RMS. Imperfect knowledge of the SLSF, rather than stellar jitter,\nsets the precision floor for chromospherically quiet stars analyzed with the\niodine technique using Keck HIRES and other slit-fed spectrometers. It is\nincreasingly common practice for astronomers to scale stellar noise in\nquadrature with formal errors such that their Keplerian model yields a\nchi-squared fit of 1.0. When this is done, errors from inaccurate modeling of\nthe SLSF (and perhaps from other sources) are attributed to the star and the\nfloor of the stellar noise is overestimated.\n", "  We report experimental signals of Bose-Einstein condensation in the decay of\nhot Ca projectile-like sources produced in mid-peripheral collisions at\nsub-Fermi energies. The experimental setup, constituted by the coupling of the\nINDRA 4$\\pi$ detector array to the forward angle VAMOS magnetic spectrometer,\nallowed us to reconstruct the mass, charge and excitation energy of the\ndecaying hot projectile-like sources. Furthermore, by means of quantum\nfluctuation analysis techniques, temperatures and mean volumes per particle \"as\nseen by\" bosons and fermions separately are correlated to the excitation energy\nof the reconstructed system. The obtained results are consistent with the\nproduction of dilute mixed (bosons/fermions) systems, where bosons experience a\nsmaller volume as compared to the surrounding fermionic gas. Our findings\nrecall similar phenomena observed in the study of boson condensates in atomic\ntraps.\n", "  Disks moving in a narrow channel have many features in common with the glassy\nbehavior of hard spheres in three dimensions. In this paper we study the caging\nbehavior of the disks which sets in at characteristic packing fraction\n$\\phi_d$. Four-point overlap functions similar to those studied when\ninvestigating dynamical heterogeneities have been determined from event driven\nmolecular dynamics simulations and the time dependent dynamical length scale\nhas been extracted from them. The dynamical length scale increases with time\nand, on the equilibration time scale, it is proportional to the static length\nscale associated with the zigzag ordering in the system, which grows rapidly\nabove $\\phi_d$. The structural features responsible for the onset of caging and\nthe glassy behavior are easy to identify as they show up in the structure\nfactor, which we have determined exactly from the transfer matrix approach.\n", "  The algebraic formulation of Wick's theorem that allows one to present the\nvacuum or thermal averages of the chronological product of an arbitrary number\nof field operators as a determinant (permanent) of the matrix is proposed. Each\nelement of the matrix is the average of the chronological product of only two\noperators. This formulation is extremely convenient for practical calculations\nin quantum field theory and statistical physics by the methods of symbolic\nmathematics using computers.\n", "  We give an example of a wide class of problems for which quantum information\nprotocols based on multi-system entanglement can be mapped into much simpler\nones involving one system. Secret sharing is a cryptographic primitive which\nplays a central role in various secure multiparty computation tasks and\nmanagement of keys in cryptography. In secret sharing protocols, a classical\nmessage is divided into shares given to recipient parties in such a way that\nsome number of parties need to collaborate in order to reconstruct the message.\nQuantum protocols for the task commonly rely on multi-partite GHZ entanglement.\nWe present a multiparty secret sharing protocol which requires only sequential\ncommunication of a single quantum d-level system (for any prime d). It has huge\nadvantages in scalabilility and can be realized with the state of the art\ntechnology. n be realized with the state of the art technology.\n", "  In this work, we introduce two models of the hybrid metric-Palatini theory of\ngravitation. We explore their background evolution, showing explicitly that one\nrecovers standard General Relativity with an effective Cosmological Constant at\nlate times. This happens because the Palatini Ricci scalar evolves towards and\nasymptotically settles at the minimum of its effective potential during\ncosmological evolution. We then use a combination of cosmic microwave\nbackground, supernovae and baryonic accoustic oscillations background data to\nconstrain the models' free parameters. For both models, we are able to\nconstrain the maximum deviation from the gravitational constant $G$ one can\nhave at early times to be around $1\\%$.\n", "  We present a new multi-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics code for massive\nstellar core-collapse in full general relativity (GR). Employing an M1\nanalytical closure scheme, we solve spectral neutrino transport of the\nradiation energy and momentum based on a truncated moment formalism. Regarding\nneutrino opacities, we take into account a baseline set in state-of-the-art\nsimulations, in which inelastic neutrinoelectron scattering, thermal neutrino\nproduction via pair annihilation and nucleonnucleon bremsstrahlung are\nincluded. While the Einstein field equations and the spatial advection terms in\nthe radiation-hydrodynamics equations are evolved explicitly, the source terms\ndue to neutrino-matter interactions and energy shift in the radiation moment\nequations are integrated implicitly by an iteration method. To verify our code,\nwe first perform a series of standard radiation tests with analytical solutions\nthat include the check of gravitational redshift and Doppler shift. A good\nagreement in these tests supports the reliability of the GR multi-energy\nneutrino transport scheme. We then conduct several test simulations of\ncore-collapse, bounce, and shock-stall of a 15Msun star in the Cartesian\ncoordinates and make a detailed comparison with published results. Our code\nperforms quite well to reproduce the results of full-Boltzmann neutrino\ntransport especially before bounce. In the postbounce phase, our code basically\nperforms well, however, there are several differences that are most likely to\ncome from the insufficient spatial resolution in our current 3D-GR models. For\nclarifying the resolution dependence and extending the code comparison in the\nlate postbounce phase, we discuss that next-generation Exaflops-class\nsupercomputers are at least needed.\n", "  We propose and demonstrate a scheme to realize a high-efficiency truly\nquantum random number generator (RNG) at room temperature (RT). Using an\neffective extractor with simple time bin encoding method, the avalanche pulses\nof avalanche photodiode (APD) are converted into high-quality random numbers\n(RNs) that are robust to slow varying noise such as fluctuations of pulse\nintensity and temperature. A light source is compatible but not necessary in\nthis scheme. Therefor the robustness of the system is effective enhanced. The\nrandom bits generation rate of this proof-of-principle system is 0.69 Mbps with\ndouble APDs and 0.34 Mbps with single APD. The results indicate that a\nhigh-speed RNG chip based on the scheme is potentially available with an\nintegrable APD array.\n", "  We show that any quantum information theory based on anticommuting operators\nmust be supplemented by a superselection rule deeply rooted in relativity to\nestablish a reasonable notion of entanglement. While quantum information may be\nencoded in the fermionic Fock space, the unrestricted theory has a peculiar\nfeature: The marginals of bipartite pure states need not have identical\nentropies, which leads to an ambiguous definition of entanglement. We solve\nthis problem, by proving that it is removed by relativity, i.e., by the parity\nsuperselection rule that arises from Lorentz invariance via the spin-statistics\nconnection. Our results hence unveil a fundamental conceptual inseparability of\nquantum information and the causal structure of relativistic field theory.\n", "  For active particles the interplay between the self-generated hydrodynamic\nflow and an external shear flow, especially near bounding surfaces, can result\nin a rich behavior of the particles not easily foreseen from the consideration\nof the active and external driving mechanisms in isolation. For instance, under\ncertain conditions, the particles exhibit \"rheotaxis,\" i.e., they align their\ndirection of motion with the plane of shear spanned by the direction of the\nflow and the normal of the bounding surface and move with or against the flow.\nTo date, studies of rheotaxis have focused on elongated particles (e.g.,\nspermatozoa), for which rheotaxis can be understood intuitively in terms of a\n\"weather vane\" mechanism. Here we investigate the possibility that spherical\nactive particles, for which the \"weather vane\" mechanism is excluded due to the\nsymmetry of the shape, may nevertheless exhibit rheotaxis. Combining analytical\nand numerical calculations, we show that, for a broad class of spherical active\nparticles, rheotactic behavior may emerge via a mechanism which involves\n\"self-trapping\" near a hard wall owing to the active propulsion of the\nparticles, combined with their rotation, alignment, and \"locking\" of the\ndirection of motion into the shear plane. In this state, the particles move\nsolely up- or downstream at a steady height and orientation.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate the problem of localization and the Hodge\nduality for a $q-$form field on a $p-$brane with codimension one. By a general\nKaluza-Klein (KK) decomposition without gauge fixing, we obtain two\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger-like equations for two types of KK modes of the bulk $q-$form\nfield, which determine the localization and mass spectra of these KK modes. It\nis found that there are two types of zero modes (the $0-$level modes): a\n$q-$form zero mode and a $(q-1)-$form one, which cannot be localized on the\nbrane at the same time. For the $n-$level KK modes, there are two interacting\nKK modes, a massive $q-$form KK mode and a massless $(q-1)-$form one. By\nanalyzing gauge invariance of the effective action and choosing a gauge\ncondition, the $n-$level massive $q-$form KK mode decouples from the $n-$level\nmassless $(q-1)-$form one. It is also found that the Hodge duality in the bulk\nnaturally becomes two dualities on the brane. The first one is the Hodge\nduality between a $q-$form zero mode and a $(p-q-1)-$form one, or between a\n$(q-1)-$form zero mode and a $(p-q)-$form one. The second duality is between\ntwo group KK modes: one is an $n-$level massive $q-$form KK mode with mass\n$m_n$ and an $n-$level massless $(q-1)-$form mode; another is an $n-$level\n$(p-q)-$form one with the same mass $m_n$ and an $n-$level massless\n$(p-q-1)-$form mode. Because of the dualities, the effective field theories on\nthe brane for the KK modes of the two dual bulk form fields are physically\nequivalent.\n", "  The recent observation of high-temperature superconductivity in one unit cell\nthick FeSe on SrTiO3 (1UC FeSe/STO)1 initiated a new pathway to realizing even\nhigher transition temperature (Tc) superconductors and established a promising\ndifferent paradigm to understand the mechanism of high temperature\nsuperconductivity2-10. However, independent confirmation on the high Tc value,\nthe role of capping layer in reducing Tc, and the underlying mechanism of the\nnovel superconductivity remain open questions11. Here we report a time-resolved\nstudy of the excited state ultrafast dynamics of 1UC FeSe/STO protected by 2UC\nFeTe capping layer, and identify the superconducting Tc to be 68 (-5/+2) K. We\nfound a coherent acoustic phonon mode in the capping layer, which provides an\nadditional decay channel to the gluing bosons and explains the reduced Tc\nvalue. Our investigation supports the phonon pairing scenario.\n", "  Here we review the recent progress made in the detection, examination,\ncharacterisation and interpretation of oscillations manifesting in small-scale\nmagnetic elements in the solar photosphere. This region of the Sun's atmosphere\nis especially dynamic, and importantly, permeated with an abundance of magnetic\nfield concentrations. Such magnetic features can span diameters of hundreds to\nmany tens of thousands of km, and are thus commonly referred to as the\n`building blocks' of the magnetic solar atmosphere. However, it is the smallest\nmagnetic elements that have risen to the forefront of solar physics research in\nrecent years. Structures, which include magnetic bright points, are often at\nthe diffraction limit of even the largest of solar telescopes. Importantly, it\nis the improvements in facilities, instrumentation, imaging techniques and\nprocessing algorithms during recent years that have allowed researchers to\nexamine the motions, dynamics and evolution of such features on the smallest\nspatial and temporal scales to date. It is clear that while these structures\nmay demonstrate significant magnetic field strengths, their small sizes make\nthem prone to the buffeting supplied by the ubiquitous surrounding convective\nplasma motions. Here, it is believed that magnetohydrodynamic waves can be\ninduced, which propagate along the field lines, carrying energy upwards to the\noutermost extremities of the solar corona. Such wave phenomena can exist in a\nvariety of guises, including fast and slow magneto-acoustic modes, in addition\nto Alfven waves. Coupled with rapid advancements in magnetohydrodynamic wave\ntheory, we are now in an ideal position to thoroughly investigate how wave\nmotion is generated in the solar photosphere, which oscillatory modes are most\nprevalent, and the role that these waves play in supplying energy to various\nlayers of the solar atmosphere.\n", "  We show that supersymmetric M-theory compactifications to three-dimensional\nMinkowski space-time preserving $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry allow for a class\nof internal manifolds more general than the Calabi-Yau one, namely the class of\nlocally conformally K\\\"ahler manifolds which locally carry a preferred\nCalabi-Yau structure.\n", "  We adopt an isotropic representation of the Fourier-transformed two-point\ncorrelation tensor of the magnetic field to estimate the magnetic energy and\nhelicity spectra as well as current helicity spectra of two individual active\nregions (NOAA 11158 and NOAA 11515) and the change of the spectral indices\nduring their development as well as during the solar cycle. The departure of\nthe spectral indices of magnetic energy and current helicity from 5/3 are\nanalyzed, and it is found that it is lower than the spectral index of the\nmagnetic energy spectrum. Furthermore, the fractional magnetic helicity tends\nto increase when the scale of the energy-carrying magnetic structures\nincreases. The magnetic helicity of NOAA 11515 violates the expected\nhemispheric sign rule, which is interpreted as an effect of enhanced field\nstrengths at scales larger than 30-60Mm with opposite signs of helicity. This\nis consistent with the general cycle dependence, which shows that around the\nsolar maximum the magnetic energy and helicity spectra are steeper, emphasizing\nthe large-scale field.\n", "  Recent works in the information science literature have presented cases of\nusing patent databases and patent classification information to construct\nnetwork maps of technology fields, which aim to aid in competitive intelligence\nanalysis and innovation decision making. Constructing such a patent network\nrequires a proper measure of the distance between different classes of patents\nin the patent classification systems. Despite the existence of various distance\nmeasures in the literature, it is unclear how to consistently assess and\ncompare them, and which ones to select for constructing patent technology\nnetwork maps. This ambiguity has limited the development and applications of\nsuch technology maps. Herein, we propose to compare alternative distance\nmeasures and identify the superior ones by analyzing the differences and\nsimilarities in the structural properties of resulting patent network maps.\nUsing United States patent data from 1976 to 2006 and International Patent\nClassification system, we compare 12 representative distance measures, which\nquantify inter-field knowledge base proximity, field-crossing diversification\nlikelihood or frequency of innovation agents, and co-occurrences of patent\nclasses in the same patents. Our comparative analyses suggest the patent\ntechnology network maps based on normalized co-reference and inventor\ndiversification likelihood measures are the best representatives.\n", "  A minimax estimator has the minimum possible error (\"risk\") in the worst\ncase. We construct the first minimax estimators for quantum state tomography\nwith relative entropy risk. The minimax risk of non-adaptive tomography scales\nas $O(1/\\sqrt{N})$, in contrast to that of classical probability estimation\nwhich is $O(1/N)$. We trace this deficiency to sampling mismatch: future\nobservations that determine risk may come from a different sample space than\nthe past data that determine the estimate. This makes minimax estimators very\nbiased, and we propose a computationally tractable alternative with similar\nbehavior in the worst case, but superior accuracy on most states.\n", "  We propose an experimental protocol to directly observe the Kondo effect by\nscattering ultracold atoms with spin-dependent interactions. We propose using\nan optical Feshbach resonance to engineer Kondo-type spin-dependent\ninteractions in a system with ultracold $^6$Li and $^{87}$Rb gases. We\ncalculate the momentum transferred from the $^{87}$Rb gas to the $^6$Li gas in\na scattering experiment and show that it has a logarithmically enhanced\ntemperature dependence, characteristic of the Kondo effect and analogous to the\nresistivity of alloys with magnetic impurities. Experimentally detecting this\nenhancement will give a different perspective on the Kondo effect, and allow us\nto explore a rich variety of problems such as the Kondo lattice problem and\nheavy-fermion systems.\n", "  Mott insulators with strong spin-orbit coupling have been proposed to host\nunconventional magnetic states, including the Kitaev quantum spin liquid. The\n4$d$ system $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has recently come into view as a candidate Kitaev\nsystem, with evidence for unusual spin excitations in magnetic scattering\nexperiments. We apply a combination of optical spectroscopy and Raman\nscattering to study the electronic structure of this material. Our measurements\nreveal a series of orbital excitations involving localized total angular\nmomentum states of the Ru ion, implying that strong spin-orbit coupling and\nelectron-electron interactions coexist in this material. Analysis of these\nfeatures allows us to estimate the spin-orbit coupling strength, as well as\nother parameters describing the local electronic structure, revealing a\nwell-defined hierarchy of energy scales within the Ru $d$ states. By comparing\nour experimental results with density functional theory calculations, we also\nclarify the overall features of the optical response. Our results demonstrate\nthat $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is an ideal material system to study spin-orbit coupled\nmagnetism on the honeycomb lattice.\n", "  We formulate the basic framework of thermodynamical entropic force cosmology\nwhich allows variation of the gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light\n$c$. Three different approaches to the formulation of the field equations are\npresented. Some cosmological solutions for each framework are given and one of\nthem is tested against combined observational data (supernovae, BAO, and CMB).\nFrom the fit of the data it is found that the Hawking temperature numerical\ncoefficient $\\gamma$ is two to four orders of magnitude less than usually\nassumed on the geometrical ground theoretical value of $O(1)$ and that it is\nalso compatible with zero. Besides, in the entropic scenario we observationally\ntest that the fit of the data is allowed for the speed of light $c$ growing and\nthe gravitational constant $G$ diminishing during the evolution of the\nuniverse. We also obtain a bound on the variation of $c$ to be $\\Delta c/c\n\\propto 10^{-5} >0$ which is at least one order of magnitude weaker than the\nquasar spectra observational bound.\n", "  L\\'evy flights are random walks where the dynamics is dominated by rare\nevents. Even though they have been studied in vastly different physical\nsystems, their observation in a single quantum system has remained elusive.\nHere we analyze a periodically driven open central spin system and demonstrate\ntheoretically that the dynamics of the spin environment exhibits L\\'evy\nflights. For the particular realization in a single-electron charged quantum\ndot driven by periodic resonant laser pulses, we use Monte Carlo simulations to\nconfirm that the long waiting times between successive nuclear spin flip events\nare governed by a power-law distribution; the corresponding exponent $\\eta\n=-3/2$ can be directly measured in real-time by observing the waiting time\ndistribution of successive photon emission events. Remarkably, the dominant\nintrinsic limitation of the scheme arising from nuclear quadrupole coupling can\nbe minimized by adjusting the magnetic field or by implementing spin echo.\n", "  The VuQ model involves the addition of a vector isosinglet up-type quark to\nthe standard model. In this model the full CKM quark mixing matrix is 4 X 3.\nUsing present flavor-physics data, we perform a fit to this full CKM matrix,\nlooking for signals of new physics (NP). We find that the VuQ model is very\nstrongly constrained. There are no hints of NP in the CKM matrix, and any VuQ\ncontributions to loop-level flavor-changing b -> s, b -> d and s -> d\ntransitions are very small. There can be significant enhancements of the\nbranching ratios of the flavor-changing decays t -> u Z and t -> c Z, but these\nare still below present detection levels.\n", "  Many theories beyond the standard model (BSM) contain new CP-odd and CP-even\nneutral scalars $\\phi = \\{A,H\\}$, and new vector-like fermions ($\\psi_{VL}$).\nThe couplings of the CP-odd scalar $A$ to two standard model (SM) gauge bosons\ncannot occur from renormalizable operators in a CP-conserving sector, but can\nbe induced at the quantum loop level. We compute these effective couplings at\nthe 1-loop level induced by the SM fermions and vector-like fermions, present\nanalytical expressions for them, and plot them numerically. Using the 8~TeV\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC) $\\gamma\\gamma$, $\\tau^{+} \\tau^{-}$ and $t \\bar t$\nchannel data, we derive constraints on the effective couplings of the $\\phi$ to\nstandard model gauge bosons and fermions. We present the gluon-fusion channel\ncross-sections of the $\\phi$ at the 8~and~14~TeV LHC, and its branching-ratios\ninto SM fermion and gauge-boson pairs. We present our results first\nmodel-independently, and then also for some simple models containing $\\phi$ and\n$\\psi_{VL}$ in the singlet and doublet representations of $SU(2)$. In the\ndoublet case, we focus on the two-Higgs-doublet (2HDM) Type-II and Type-X\nmodels in the alignment limit.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the spectroscopy and decay rates of charmonia\nwithin the framework of non-relativistic Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation by employing\nan approximate inter quark-antiquark potential. The spin hyperfine, spin-orbit\nand tensor components of the one gluon exchange interaction are employed to\ncompute the spectroscopy of the excited S states and few low-lying P and D\nwaves. The resultant wave functions at zero inter quark separation as well as\nsome finite separation are employed to predict the di-gamma, di-leptonic and\ndi-gluon decay rates of charmonia states by using the conventional Van\nRoyen-Weisskopf formula. The di-gamma and di-leptonic decay widths are also\ncomputed by incorporating the relativistic corrections of order $v^4$ within\nthe NRQCD formalism. We have observed that the NRQCD predictions with their\nmatrix elements computed at finite radial separation yielded results which are\nfound to be in better agreement with experimental value for both di-gamma and\ndi-leptonic decays. The same scenario is seen in the case when di-gamma and\ndi-leptonic decay widths are computed with Van Royen-Weisskopf formula. It is\nalso observed that the di-gluon decay width with the inclusion of binding\nenergy effects are in better agreement with the experimental data available for\n1S-2S and 1P. The di-gluon decay width of 3S and 2P waves waves are also\npredicted. Thus, the present study of decay rates clearly indicates the\nimportance of binding energy effects.\n", "  In the random-interaction ensembles, three proportional correlations between\nquadrupole moments of the first two $I^{\\pi}=2^+$ states robustly emerge,\nincluding $Q(2^+_1)=\\pm Q(2^+_2)$ correlations consistently with realistic\nnuclear survey, and the $Q(2^+_2)=-\\frac{3}{7}Q(2^+_1)$ correlation, which is\nonly observed in the $sd$-boson space. These correlations can be\nmicroscopically characterized by the rotational SU(3) symmetry and quadrupole\nvibrational U(5) limit, respectively, according to the Elliott model and the\n$sd$-boson mean-field theory. The anharmonic vibration may be another\nphenomenological interpretation for the $Q(2^+_1)=- Q(2^+_2)$ correlation,\nwhose spectral evidence, however, is insufficient.\n", "  IIn the pseudogap regime of the cuprates, charge order breaks a\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ symmetry. Therefore, the interaction of charge order and\nquenched disorder due to potential scattering, can, in principle, be treated as\na random field Ising model. A numerical analysis of the ground state of such a\nrandom field Ising model reveals local, glassy dynamics in both $2D$ and $3D$.\nThe glassy dynamics are treated as a heat bath which couple to the itinerant\nelectrons, leading to an unusual electronic non-Fermi liquid. If the dynamics\nare strong enough, the electron spectral function has no quasiparticle peak and\nthe effective mass diverges at the Fermi surface, precluding quantum\noscillations. In contrast to charge density, $d$-density wave order (reflecting\nstaggered circulating currents) does not directly couple to potential disorder,\nallowing it to support quantum oscillations. At fourth order in Landau theory,\nthere is a term consisting of the square of the $d$-density wave order\nparameter, and the square of the charge order. This coupling could induce\nparasitic charge order, which may be weak enough for the Fermi liquid behavior\nto remain uncorrupted. Here, we argue that this distinction must be made clear,\nas one interprets quantum oscillations in cuprates.\n", "  We present a new and computationally efficient method for characterizing very\nlow mass companions using low resolution ($R\\sim$30) near-infrared ($YJH$)\nspectra from high contrast imaging campaigns with integral field spectrograph\n(IFS) units. We conduct a detailed quantitative comparison of the efficacy of\nthis method through tests on simulated data comparable in spectral coverage and\nresolution to the currently operating direct imaging systems around the world.\nIn particular, we simulate Project 1640 data as an example of the use,\naccuracy, and precision of this technique. We present results from comparing\nsimulated spectra of M, L, and T dwarfs with a large and finely-sampled grid of\nsynthetic spectra using Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. We determine the\nprecision and accuracy of effective temperature and surface gravity inferred\nfrom fits to PHOENIX dusty and cond, which we find reproduce the low-resolution\nspectra of all objects within the adopted flux uncertainties. Uncertainties in\neffective temperature decrease from $\\pm$100-500 K for M dwarfs to as small as\n$\\pm$30 K for some L and T spectral types. Surface gravity is constrained to\nwithin 0.2-0.4 dex for mid-L through T dwarfs, but uncertainties are as large\nas 1.0 dex or more for M dwarfs. Results for effective temperature from\nlow-resolution $YJH$ spectra generally match predictions from published\nspectral type-temperature relationships except for L-T transition objects and\nyoung objects. Single-band spectra (i.e., narrower wavelength coverage) result\nin larger uncertainties and often discrepant results, suggesting that high\ncontrast IFS observing campaigns can compensate for low spectral resolution by\nexpanding the wavelength coverage for reliable characterization of detected\ncompanions. [Abstract truncated]\n", "  Matter with chiral fermions is microscopically described by theory with\nquantum anomaly and macroscopically described (at low energy) by anomalous\nhydrodynamics. For such systems in the presence of external magnetic field and\nchirality imbalance, a charge current is generated along the magnetic field\ndirection --- a phenomenon known as the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME). The\nquark-gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy ion collisions provides an\n(approximate) example, for which the CME predicts a charge separation\nperpendicular to the collisional reaction plane. Charge correlation\nmeasurements designed for the search of such signal have been done at RHIC and\nthe LHC for which the interpretations, however, remain unclear due to\ncontamination by background effects that are collective flow driven,\ntheoretically poorly constrained, and experimentally hard to separate. Using\nanomalous (and viscous) hydrodynamic simulations, we make a first attempt at\nquantifying contributions to observed charge correlations from both CME and\nbackground effects in one and same framework. The implications for the search\nof CME are discussed.\n", "  Lens modeling of resolved image data has advanced rapidly over the past two\ndecades. More recently pixel-based approaches, wherein the source is\nreconstructed on an irregular or adaptive grid, have become popular. Generally,\nthe source reconstruction takes place in a Bayesian framework and is guided by\na set of sensible priors. We discuss the integration of a shapelets-based\nmethod into a Bayesian framework and quantify the required regularization. In\nsuch approaches, the source is reconstructed analytically, using a subset of a\ncomplete and orthonormal set of basis functions, known as shapelets. To\ncalculate the flux in an image plane pixel, the pixel is split into two or more\ntriangles (depending on the local magnification), and each shapelet basis\nfunction is integrated over the source plane. Source regularization\n(enforcement of priors on the source) can also be performed analytically. This\napproach greatly reduces the number of source parameters from the thousands to\nhundreds and results in a posterior probability distribution that is much less\nnoisy than pixel-based approaches.\n", "  We use gauge-string duality to model the $N$-quark potential in pure\nYang-Mills theories. For $SU(3)$, the result agrees remarkably well with\nlattice simulations. The model smoothly interpolates between almost the\n$\\Delta$-law at small distances and the Y-law at large distances.\n", "  Within the last decade, due to significant improvements in the spatial and\ntemporal resolution of chromospheric data, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave\nstudies in this fascinating region of the Sun's atmosphere have risen to the\nforefront of solar physics research. In this review we begin by reviewing the\nchallenges and debates that have manifested in relation to MHD wave mode\nidentification in fine-scale chromospheric magnetic structures, including\nspicules, fibrils and mottles. Next we go on to discuss how the process of\naccurately identifying MHD wave modes also has a crucial role to play in\nestimating their wave energy flux. This is of cardinal importance for\nestimating what the possible contribution of MHD waves is to solar atmospheric\nheating. Finally, we detail how such advances in chromospheric MHD wave studies\nhave also allowed us, for the first time, to implement cutting-edge\nmagnetoseismological techniques that provide new insight into the\nsub-resolution plasma structuring of the lower solar atmosphere.\n", "  We report a first-principle theoretical study of the adiabatic decoherence\nundergone by a nuclear spin system in a solid, coupled to the phonon field\nthrough the dipolar interaction. The calculations are performed for a chain of\nweakly interacting 1/2-spin pairs, considered as an open quantum system in\ncontact with a bosonic heat bath. By incorporating to the whole system\nHamiltonian the fluctuations of the local dipolar energy produced by low\nfrequency phonons, and assuming that this low energy fluctuations are\nadiabatic, we find that the spin dynamics can be described in closed form\nthrough a spin-boson model. The obtained results show that the coupling with\nthe phonons destroy the spin coherence, and the efficiency of the process\nsignificantly depends on the complexity of the involved spin states. By using\nrealistic values for the various parameters of the model, we conclude that this\nmechanism can be particularly efficient to degrade multi-spin coherences, when\nthe number of `active' spins involved in a given coherence is high. In this\nway, we show that the spin coherence in the adiabatic regime can be noticeably\naffected by this mechanism.\n", "  We propose a method for analyzing two-dimensional symmetry protected\ntopological (SPT) wavefunctions using a correspondence with conformal field\ntheories (CFTs) and integrable lattice models. This method generalizes the CFT\napproach for the fractional quantum Hall effect wherein the wavefunction\namplitude is written as a many-operator correlator in the CFT. Adopting a\nbottom-up approach, we start from various known microscopic wavefunctions of\nSPTs with discrete symmetries and show how the CFT description emerges at large\nscale, thereby revealing a deep connection between group cocyles and critical,\nsometimes integrable, models. We show that the CFT describing the bulk\nwavefunction is often also the one describing the entanglement spectrum, but\nnot always. Using a plasma analogy, we also prove the existence of hidden\nquasi-long-range order for a large class of SPTs. Finally, we show how response\nto symmetry fluxes is easily described in terms of the CFT.\n", "  A remarkably long-lived spin plasmon may exist in two-dimensional electron\nliquids with imbalanced spin up and spin down population. Predictions for this\ninteresting mode by Agarwal et al. [Phys. Rev. B 90, 155409 (2014)] are based\non the random phase approximation. We here show how to account for spin\ndependent correlations from known ground state pair correlation functions and\nstudy the consequences on the various spin dependent longitudinal response\nfunctions. The spin plasmon dispersion relation and its critical wave vector\nfor Landau damping by minority spins turn out to be significantly lowered. We\nfurther demonstrate that spin dependent effective interactions imply a rich\nstructure in the excitation spectrum of the partially spin-polarized system.\nMost notably, we find a \"magnetic antiresonance\", where the imaginary part of\nboth, the spin-spin as well as the density-spin response function vanish. The\nresulting minimum in the double-differential cross section is awaiting\nexperimental confirmation.\n", "  We address the problem of Dirac fermions interacting with longitudinal\nphonons. A gap in the spectrum of fermions leads to the emergence of the\nChern--Simons excitations in the spectrum of phonons. We study the effect of\nthose excitations on observable quantities: the phonon dispersion, the phonon\nspectral density, and the Hall conductivity.\n", "  Coronal holes are the dark patches in the solar corona associated with\nrelatively cool, less dense plasma and unipolar fields. The fast component of\nthe solar wind emanates from these regions. Several observations reveal the\npresence of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in coronal holes which are believed\nto play a key role in the acceleration of fast solar wind. The recent advent of\nhigh-resolution instruments had brought us many new insights on the properties\nof MHD waves in coronal holes which are reviewed in this article. The advances\nmade in the identification of compressive slow MHD waves in both polar and\nequatorial coronal holes, their possible connection with the recently\ndiscovered high- speed quasi-periodic upflows, their dissipation, and the\ndetection of damping in Alfven waves from the spectral line width variation are\ndiscussed in particular.\n", "  In this paper we consider the single patch pseudo-spectral scheme for\ntensorial and spinorial evolution problems on the 2-sphere presented in [3,4]\nwhich is based on the spin-weighted spherical harmonics transform. We apply and\nextend this method to Einstein's equations and certain classes of spherical\ncosmological spacetimes. More specifically, we use the hyperbolic reductions of\nEinstein's equations obtained in the generalized wave map gauge formalism\ncombined with Geroch's symmetry reduction, and focus on cosmological spacetimes\nwith spatial S3-topologies and symmetry groups U(1) or U(1) x U(1). We discuss\nanalytical and numerical issues related to our implementation. We test our code\nby reproducing the exact inhomogeneous cosmological solutions of the vacuum\nEinstein field equations obtained in [7].\n", "  The 2014 Ebola outbreak in west Africa raised many questions about the\ncontrol of infectious disease in an increasingly connected global society.\nLimited availability of contact information made contact tracing difficult or\nimpractical in combating the outbreak. We consider the development of\nmulti-scale public health strategies and simulate policies for community-level\nresponse aimed at early screening of communities rather than individuals, as\nwell as travel restrictions to prevent community cross-contamination. Our\nanalysis shows the policies to be effective even at a relatively low level of\ncompliance. In our simulations, 40% of individuals conforming to these policies\nis enough to stop the outbreak. Simulations with a 50% compliance rate are\nconsistent with the case counts in Liberia during the period of rapid decline\nafter mid September, 2014. We also find the travel restriction to be effective\nat reducing the risks associated with compliance substantially below the 40%\nlevel, shortening the outbreak and enabling efforts to be focused on affected\nareas. Our results suggest that the multi-scale approach can be used to further\nevolve public health strategy for defeating emerging epidemics.\n", "  We have constructed an asymmetric matter-wave beam splitter and a ring\npotential on an atom chip with Bose-Einstein condensates using radio-frequency\ndressing. By applying rf-field parallel to the quantization axis in the\nvicinity of the static trap minima added to perpendicular rf-fields, versatile\ncontrollability on the potentials is realized. Asymmetry of the rf-induced\ndouble well is manipulated without discernible displacement of the each well\nalong horizontal and vertical direction. Formation of an isotropic ring\npotential on an atom chip is achieved by compensating the gradient due to\ngravity and inhomogeneous coupling strength. In addition, position and rotation\nvelocity of a BEC along the ring geometry are controlled by the relative phase\nand the frequency difference between the rf-fields, respectively.\n", "  We present the first simulations of tidal stirring of dwarf galaxies in the\nLocal Group carried out in a cosmological context. We use the ErisDARK\nsimulation of a MW-sized galaxy to identify some of the most massive subhalos\n($M_{vir} > 10^8 M_{\\odot}$) that fall into the main host before $z=2$.\nSubhalos are replaced before infall with high-resolution models of dwarf\ngalaxies comprising a faint stellar disk embedded in a dark matter halo. The\nset of models contains cuspy halos as well as halos with \"cored\" profiles (with\nasymptotic inner slope $\\gamma = 0.6$). The simulations are then run to $z=0$\nwith as many as 54 million particles and resolution as small as $\\sim 4$ pc\nusing the N-Body code ChaNGa. The stellar components of all satellites are\nsignificantly affected by tidal stirring, losing stellar mass and undergoing a\nmorphological transformation towards a pressure supported spheroidal system.\nHowever, while some remnants with cuspy halos maintain significant rotational\nflattening and disk-like features, all the shallow halo models achieve\n$v/\\sigma < 0.5$ and round shapes typical of dSph satellites of the MW and M31.\nMass loss is also enhanced in the latter, and remnants can reach luminosities\nand velocity dispersions as low as those of Ultra Faint Dwarfs (UFDs). We argue\nthat cuspy progenitors must be the exception rather than the rule among\nsatellites of the MW since all the MW and M31 satellites in the luminosity\nrange of our remnants are dSphs, a result matched only in the simulation with\n\"cored\" models.\n", "  Investigating the CKM matrix in different parametrization schemes, it is\nnoticed that those schemes can be divided into a few groups where the sine\nvalues of the CP phase for each group are approximately equal. Using those\nrelations, several approximate equalities among the elements of CKM matrix are\nestablished. Assuming them to be exact, there are infinite numbers of solutions\nand by choosing special values for the free parameters in those solutions,\nseveral textures presented in literature are obtained. The case can also be\ngeneralized to the PMNS matrix for the lepton sector. In parallel, several\nmixing textures are also derived by using presumed symmetries, amazingly, some\nof their forms are the same as what we obtained, but not all. It hints\nexistence of a hidden symmetry which is broken in the practical world. The\nnature makes its own selection on the underlying symmetry and the way to break\nit, while we just guess what it is.\n", "  Coherent gigahertz-frequency surface acoustic waves (SAWs) traveling on the\nsurface of a piezoelectric crystal can, via the magnetoelastic interaction,\nresonantly excite traveling spin waves in an adjacent thin-film ferromagnet.\nThese excited spin waves, traveling with a definite in-plane wave-vector q\nenforced by the SAW, can be detected by measuring changes in the\nelectro-acoustical transmission of a SAW delay line. Here, we provide a first\ndemonstration that such measurements constitute a precise and quantitative\ntechnique for spin-wave spectroscopy, providing a means to determine both\nisotropic and anisotropic contributions to the spin-wave dispersion and\ndamping. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this spectroscopic technique by\nmeasuring the spin-wave properties of a Ni thin film for a large range of wave\nvectors,q = 2.5 x 10^4 - 8 x 10^4 cm^(-1), over which anisotropic dipolar\ninteractions vary from being negligible to quite significant.\n", "  By using a combination of heteroepitaxial growth, structure refinement based\non synchrotron x-ray diffraction and first-principles calculations, we show\nthat the symmetry-protected Dirac line nodes in the topological semimetallic\nperovskite SrIrO3 can be lifted simply by applying epitaxial constraints. In\nparticular, the Dirac gap opens without breaking the Pbnm mirror symmetry. In\nvirtue of a symmetry-breaking analysis, we demonstrate that the original\nsymmetry protection is related to the n-glide operation, which can be\nselectively broken by different heteroepitaxial structures. This symmetry\nprotection renders the nodal line a nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetallic state. The\nresults highlight the vital role of crystal symmetry in spin-orbit-coupled\ncorrelated oxides and provide a foundation for experimental realization of\ntopological insulators in iridate-based heterostructures.\n", "  Bell inequality violations can be used to certify private randomness for use\nin cryptographic applications. In photonic Bell experiments, a large amount of\nthe data that is generated comes from no-detection events and presumably\ncontains little randomness. This raises the question as to whether randomness\ncan be extracted only from the smaller post-selected subset corresponding to\nproper detection events, instead of from the entire set of data. This could in\nprinciple be feasible without opening an analogue of the detection loophole as\nlong as the min-entropy of the post-selected data is evaluated by taking all\nthe information into account, including no-detection events. The possibility of\nextracting randomness from a short string has a practical advantage, because it\nreduces the computational time of the extraction.\n  Here, we investigate the above idea in a simple scenario, where the devices\nand the adversary behave according to i.i.d. strategies. We show that indeed\nalmost all the randomness is present in the pair of outcomes for which at least\none detection happened. We further show that in some cases applying a\npre-processing on the data can capture features that an analysis based on\nglobal frequencies only misses, thus resulting in the certification of more\nrandomness. We then briefly consider non-i.i.d strategies and provide an\nexplicit example of such a strategy that is more powerful than any i.i.d. one\neven in the asymptotic limit of infinitely many measurement rounds, something\nthat was not reported before in the context of Bell inequalities.\n", "  The phase diagram of a half-filled hard core boson two-leg ladder in a flux\nis investigated by means of numerical simulations based on the Density Matrix\nRenormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm and bosonization. We calculate\nexperimentally accessible observables such as the momentum distribution, as\nwell as rung current, density wave and bond-order wave correlation functions,\nallowing us to identify the Mott Meissner and Mott Vortex states. We follow the\ntransition from commensurate Meissner to incommensurate Vortex state at\nincreasing interchain hopping till the critical value [Piraud et al. Phys. Rev.\nB v. 91, p. 140406 (2015)] above which the Meissner state is stable at any\nflux. For flux close to $\\pi$, and below the critical hopping, we observe the\nformation of a second incommensuration in the Mott Vortex state that could be\ndetectable in current experiments.\n", "  Strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects of heavy $d$-orbital elements have\nlong been neglected in describing the ground states of their compounds thereby\noverlooking a variety of fascinating and yet unexplored magnetic and electronic\nstates, until recently. The spin-orbit entangled electrons in such compounds\ncan get stabilized into unusual spin-orbit multiplet $J$-states which warrants\nsevere investigations. Here we show using detailed magnetic and thermodynamic\nstudies and theoretical calculations the ground state of Ba$_3$ZnIr$_2$O$_9$, a\n6$H$ hexagonal perovskite is a close realisation of the elusive $J$~=~0 state.\nHowever, we find that local Ir moments are spontaneously generated due to the\ncomparable energy scales of the singlet-triplet splitting driven by SOC and the\nsuperexchange interaction mediated by strong intra-dimer hopping. While the Ir\nions within the structural Ir$_2$O$_9$ dimer prefers to form a spin-orbit\nsinglet state (SOS) with no resultant moment, substantial interdimer exchange\ninteractions from a frustrated lattice ensure quantum fluctuations till the\nlowest measured temperatures and stabilize a spin-orbital liquid phase.\n", "  We present a survey of the dual Gromov-Hausdorff propinquity, a\nnoncommutative analogue of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance which we introduced to\nprovide a framework for the study of the noncommutative metric properties of\nC*-algebras. We first review the notions of quantum locally compact metric\nspaces, and present various examples of such structures. We then explain the\nconstruction of the dual Gromov-Hausdorff propinquity, first in the context of\nquasi-Leibniz quantum compact metric spaces, and then in the context of pointed\nquantum proper metric spaces. We include a few new result concerning\nperturbations of the metrics on Leibniz quantum compact metric spaces in\nrelation with the dual Gromov-Hausdorff propinquity.\n", "  We present a theoretical study on the recombination of a free electron into\nthe ground state of a hydrogen-like ion in the presence of an external laser\nfield. Emphasis is placed on the effects caused by the laser dressing of the\nresidual ionic bound state. To investigate how this dressing affects the total\nand angle-differential cross section of laser assisted radiative recombination\n(LARR) we apply first-order perturbation theory and the separable\nCoulomb-Volkov-continuum ansatz. Using this approach detailed calculations were\nperformed for low-$Z$ hydrogen like ions and laser intensities in the range\nfrom $I_L=10^{11}\\text{W/cm}^2$ to $I_L=10^{13}\\text{W/cm}^2$. It is seen that\nthe total cross section as a function of the laser intensity is remarkably\naffected by the bound state dressing. Moreover the laser dressing becomes\nmanifest as asymmetries in the angular distribution and the (energy) spectrum\nof the emitted recombination photons.\n", "  Using gamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope, various groups have\nidentified a clear excess emission in the Inner Galaxy, at energies around a\nfew GeV. This excess resembles remarkably well a signal from dark-matter\nannihilation. One of the most compelling astrophysical interpretations is that\nthe excess is caused by the combined effect of a previously undetected\npopulation of dim gamma-ray sources. Because of their spectral similarity, the\nbest candidates are millisecond pulsars. Here, we search for this hypothetical\nsource population, using a novel approach based on wavelet decomposition of the\ngamma-ray sky and the statistics of Gaussian random fields. Using almost seven\nyears of Fermi-LAT data, we detect a clustering of photons as predicted for the\nhypothetical population of millisecond pulsar, with a statistical significance\nof 10.0 sigma. For plausible values of the luminosity function, this population\nexplains 100% of the observed excess emission. We argue that other\nextragalactic or Galactic sources, a mismodeling of Galactic diffuse emission,\nor the thick-disk population of pulsars are unlikely to account for this\nobservation.\n", "  We point out that the prediction of the minimal chaotic inflation model is\naltered if a scalar field takes a large field value close to the Planck scale\nduring inflation due to a negative Hubble induced mass. In particular, we show\nthat the inflaton potential is effectively suppressed at a large inflaton field\nvalue in the presence of such a scalar field. The scalar field may be\nidentified with the standard model Higgs field or flat directions in\nsupersymmetric theory. With such spontaneous suppression, we find that the\nminimal chaotic inflation model, especially the model with a quadratic\npotential, is consistent with recent observations of the cosmic microwave\nbackground fluctuation without modifying the inflation model itself.\n", "  We present new parton distribution functions (PDFs) up to\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) from the CTEQ-TEA global analysis of\nquantum chromodynamics. These differ from previous CT PDFs in several respects,\nincluding the use of data from LHC experiments and the new D0 charged lepton\nrapidity asymmetry data, as well as the use of more flexible parametrization of\nPDFs that, in particular, allows a better fit to different combinations of\nquark flavors. Predictions for important LHC processes, especially Higgs boson\nproduction at 13 TeV, are presented. These CT14 PDFs include a central set and\nerror sets in the Hessian representation. For completeness, we also present the\nCT14 PDFs determined at the leading order (LO) and the next-to-leading order\n(NLO) in QCD. Besides these general-purpose PDF sets, we provide a series of\n(N)NLO sets with various $\\alpha_s$ values and additional sets in general-mass\nvariable flavor number (GM-VFN) schemes, to deal with heavy partons, with up to\n3, 4, and 6 active flavors.\n", "  We investigate the orbital effects of strong external magnetic field on the\nground state properties of a two dimensional holstein polaron, employing\nvariational approaches based on the exact diagonalization (VAED). From the\nground state energy and the wave function we calculate electron-phonon\ncorrelation function, the average phonon number and the Drude weight and\ninvestigate the evolution of a 2D holstein polaron as a function of the\nmagnetic flux. Although the external magnetic field affects the polaron\nthroughout the parameter regime, we show that the magnetic field has a stronger\neffect on a loosely bound (spatially extended) polaron. We also find that the\nmagnetic field can be used as a tuning parameter, particularly for weakly\ncoupled polaron, to reduce the spatial extent of a large polaron.\n", "  Two classes of GRBs have been confidently identified thus far and are\nprescribed to different physical scenarios -- NS-NS or NS-BH mergers, and\ncollapse of massive stars, for short and long GRBs, respectively. A third,\nintermediate in duration class, was suggested to be present in previous\ncatalogs, such as BATSE and $Swift$, based on statistical tests regarding a\nmixture of two or three log-normal distributions of $T_{90}$. However, this\nmight possibly not be an adequate model. This paper investigates whether the\ndistributions of $\\log T_{90}$ from BATSE, $Swift$, and $Fermi$ are described\nbetter by a mixture of skewed distributions rather than standard Gaussians.\nMixtures of standard normal, skew-normal, sinh-arcsinh and alpha-skew-normal\ndistributions are fitted using a maximum likelihood method. The preferred model\nis chosen based on the Akaike information criterion. It is found that mixtures\nof two skew-normal or two sinh-arcsinh distributions are more likely to\ndescribe the observed duration distribution of $Fermi$ than a mixture of three\nstandard Gaussians, and that mixtures of two sinh-arcsinh or two skew-normal\ndistributions are models competing with the conventional three-Gaussian in the\ncase of BATSE and $Swift$. Based on statistical reasoning, existence of a third\n(intermediate) class of GRBs in $Fermi$ data is rejected, and it is shown that\nother phenomenological models may describe the observed $Fermi$, BATSE, and\n$Swift$ duration distributions at least as well as a mixture of standard normal\ndistributions.\n", "  The three-dimensional momenta of quarks inside a hadron are encoded in\ntransverse momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs). This work\npresents an exploratory lattice QCD study of a TMD observable in the pion\ndescribing the Boer-Mulders effect, which is related to polarized quark\ntransverse momentum in an unpolarized hadron. Particular emphasis is placed on\nthe behavior as a function of a Collins-Soper evolution parameter quantifying\nthe relative rapidity of the struck quark and the initial hadron, e.g., in a\nsemi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) process. The lattice\ncalculation, performed at the pion mass m_pi = 518 MeV, utilizes a definition\nof TMDs via hadronic matrix elements of a quark bilocal operator with a\nstaple-shaped gauge connection; in this context, the evolution parameter is\nrelated to the staple direction. By parametrizing the aforementioned matrix\nelements in terms of invariant amplitudes, the problem can be cast in a Lorentz\nframe suited for the lattice calculation. In contrast to an earlier nucleon\nstudy, due to the lower mass of the pion, the calculated data enable\nquantitative statements about the physically interesting limit of large\nrelative rapidity. In passing, the similarity between the Boer-Mulders effects\nextracted in the pion and the nucleon is noted.\n", "  We show that, when boosted to the infinite momentum frame, the quark and\ngluon orbital angular momentum operators defined in the nucleon spin sum rule\nof X. S. Chen et al. are the same as those derived from generalized transverse\nmomentum distributions. This completes the connection between the infinite\nmomentum limit of each term in that sum rule and experimentally measurable\nobservables. We also show that these orbital angular momentum operators can be\ndefined locally, and discuss the strategies of calculating them in lattice QCD.\n", "  Macroscopic quantum phase coherence has one of its pivotal expressions in the\nJosephson effect [1], which manifests itself both in charge [2] and energy\ntransport [3-5]. The ability to master the amount of heat transferred through\ntwo tunnel-coupled superconductors by tuning their phase difference is the core\nof coherent caloritronics [4-6], and is expected to be a key tool in a number\nof nanoscience fields, including solid state cooling [7], thermal isolation [8,\n9], radiation detection [7], quantum information [10, 11] and thermal logic\n[12]. Here we show the realization of the first balanced Josephson heat\nmodulator [13] designed to offer full control at the nanoscale over the\nphase-coherent component of thermal currents. Our device provides\nmagnetic-flux-dependent temperature modulations up to 40 mK in amplitude with a\nmaximum of the flux-to-temperature transfer coefficient reaching 200 mK per\nflux quantum at a bath temperature of 25 mK. Foremost, it demonstrates the\nexact correspondence in the phase-engineering of charge and heat currents,\nbreaking ground for advanced caloritronic nanodevices such as thermal splitters\n[14], heat pumps [15] and time-dependent electronic engines [16-19].\n", "  Modeling a temporal process as if it is Markovian assumes the present encodes\nall of the process's history. When this occurs, the present captures all of the\ndependency between past and future. We recently showed that if one randomly\nsamples in the space of structured processes, this is almost never the case.\nSo, how does the Markov failure come about? That is, how do individual\nmeasurements fail to encode the past? And, how many are needed to capture\ndependencies between the past and future? Here, we investigate how much\ninformation can be shared between the past and future, but not be reflected in\nthe present. We quantify this elusive information, give explicit calculational\nmethods, and draw out the consequences. The most important of which is that\nwhen the present hides past-future dependency we must move beyond\nsequence-based statistics and build state-based models.\n", "  Astrometric surveys such as Gaia and LSST will measure parallaxes for\nhundreds of millions of stars. Yet they will not measure a single distance.\nRather, a distance must be estimated from a parallax. In this didactic article,\nI show that doing this is not trivial once the fractional parallax error is\nlarger than about 20%, which will be the case for about 80% of stars in the\nGaia catalogue. Estimating distances is an inference problem in which the use\nof prior assumptions is unavoidable. I investigate the properties and\nperformance of various priors and examine their implications. A supposed\nuninformative uniform prior in distance is shown to give very poor distance\nestimates (large bias and variance). Any prior with a sharp cut-off at some\ndistance has similar problems. The choice of prior depends on the information\none has available - and is willing to use - concerning, for example, the survey\nand the Galaxy. I demonstrate that a simple prior which decreases\nasymptotically to zero at infinite distance has good performance, accommodates\nnon-positive parallaxes, and does not require a bias correction.\n", "  We consider the braiding of Kramers pairs of Majorana bound states. We derive\nthe most general transformation on the many-body ground state that is applied\nas the result of such a braiding process. The result is derived in the context\nof a simple toy model, but we will show that it has the most general form that\nis compatible with local and global conservation of electron parity. In\naccordance with earlier work the resulting transformation turns out to be path\ndependent, which shows that Kramers pairs of Majorana bound states cannot be\nused for topological quantum computation. We also discuss under which\nconditions the result is path independent and corresponds to two independent\nexchanges of pairs of Majorana bound states.\n", "  Iron orbitals in orthorhombic iron selenide (FeSe) can produce charge-like\nmultipoles that are polar (parity-odd). Orbitals in question include Fe(3d),\nFe(4p) and p-type ligands that participate in transport properties and bonding.\nThe polar multipoles may contribute weak, space-group forbidden Bragg spots to\ndiffraction patterns collected with x-rays tuned in energy to a Fe atomic\nresonance (Templeton & Templeton scattering). Ordering of conventional, axial\nmagnetic dipoles does not accompany the tetragonal-orthorhombic structural\nphase transition in FeSe, unlike other known iron-based superconductors. We\ninitiate a new line of inquiry for this puzzling property of orthorhombic FeSe,\nusing a hidden magnetic-order that belongs to the m'm'm' magnetic\ncrystal-class. It is epitomized by the absence of ferromagnetism and axial\nmagnetic dipoles, and the appearance of magnetic monopoles and magneto-electric\nquadrupoles. A similar magnetic order occurs in cuprate superconductors, YBCO &\nHg1201, where it was unveiled with the Kerr effect and in Bragg diffraction\npatterns revealed by polarized neutrons. PACS number 75.25.-j\n", "  Double-Fourier interferometry is the most viable path to sub-arcsecond\nspatial resolution for future astronomical instruments that will observe the\nuniverse at far-infrared wavelengths. The double transform spatio-spectral\ninterferometry couples pupil plane beam combination with detector arrays to\nenable imaging spectroscopy of wide fields, that will be key to accomplishing\ntop-level science goals. The wide field of view and the necessity for these\ninstruments to fly above the opaque atmosphere create unique characteristics\nand requirements compared to instruments on ground-based telescopes. In this\npaper, we discuss some characteristics of single-baseline spatio-spectral\ninterferometers. We investigate the impact of intensity and optical path\ndifference noise on the interferogram and the spectral signal-to-noise ratio.\nWe apply our findings to the special case of the Balloon Experimental Twin\nTelescope for Infrared Interferometry (BETTII), a balloon payload that will be\na first application of this technique at far-infrared wavelengths on a flying\nplatform.\n", "  Detailed characterization of an extrasolar planet's atmosphere provides the\nbest hope for distinguishing the makeup of its outer layers, and the only hope\nfor understanding the interplay between initial composition, chemistry,\ndynamics & circulation, and disequilibrium processes. In recent years, some\nareas have seen rapid progress while developments in others have come more\nslowly and/or have been hotly contested. This article gives an observer's\nperspective on the current understanding of extrasolar planet atmospheres prior\nto the considerable advances expected from the next generation of observing\nfacilities. Atmospheric processes of both transiting and directly-imaged\nplanets are discussed, including molecular and atomic abundances, cloud\nproperties, thermal structure, and planetary energy budgets. In the future we\ncan expect a continuing and accelerating stream of new discoveries, which will\nfuel the ongoing exoplanet revolution for many years to come.\n", "  In this Note, we propose a line bundle approach to odd-dimensional analogues\nof generalized complex structures. This new approach has three main advantages:\n(1) it encompasses all existing ones; (2) it elucidates the geometric meaning\nof the integrability condition for generalized contact structures; (3) in light\nof new results on multiplicative forms and Spencer operators, it allows a\nsimple interpretation of the defining equations of a generalized contact\nstructure in terms of Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids.\n", "  We study the structure of vorticity and hydrodynamic helicity fields in\nperipheral heavy-ion collisions using the kinetic Quark-Gluon String Model. The\nangular momentum conservation within this model holds with a good accuracy. We\nobserve the formation of specific toroidal structures of vorticity field\n(vortex sheets). Their existence is mirrored in the polarization of hyperons of\nthe percent order.\n", "  This review addresses the state of research that employs astronomical (remote\nsensing) observations of solids (\"dust\") in young circumstellar disks to learn\nabout planet formation. The intention is for it to serve as an accessible,\nintroductory, pedagogical resource for junior scientists interested in the\nsubject. After some historical background and a basic observational primer, the\nfocus is shifted to the three fundamental topics that broadly define the field:\n(1) demographics -- the relationships between disk properties and the\ncharacteristics of their environments and hosts; (2) structure -- the spatial\ndistribution of disk material and its associated physical conditions and\ncomposition; and (3) evolution -- the signposts of key changes in disk\nproperties, including the growth and migration of solids and the impact of\ndynamical interactions with young planetary systems. Based on the state of the\nart results in these areas, suggestions are made for potentially fruitful lines\nof work in the near future.\n", "  Planets are known to orbit giant stars, yet there is a shortage of planets\norbiting within ~0.5 AU (P<100 days). First-ascent giants have not expanded\nenough to engulf such planets, but tidal forces can bring planets to the\nsurface of the star far beyond the stellar radius. So the question remains: are\ntidal forces strong enough in these stars to engulf all the missing planets? We\ndescribe a high-cadence observational program to obtain precise radial\nvelocities of bright giants from Weihai Observatory of Shandong University. We\npresent data on the planet host Beta Gem (HD 62509), confirming our ability to\nderive accurate and precise velocities; our data achieve an rms of 7.3 m/s\nabout the Keplerian orbit fit. This planet-search programme currently receives\n~100 nights per year, allowing us to aggressively pursue short-period planets\nto determine whether they are truly absent.\n", "  Recent results from neutrino experiments show evidence for light sterile\nneutrinos which do not have any Standard Model interactions. In this work we\nstudy the hidden interaction of sterile neutrinos with an \"MeV scale\" gauge\nboson (the $\\nu_s$HI model) with mass $M_X$ and leptonic coupling $g^\\prime_l$.\nBy performing an analysis on the $\\nu_s$HI model using the data of the MINOS\nneutrino experiment we find that the values above $G_X/G_F=92.4$ are excluded\nby more than $2\\sigma$ C.L., where $G_F$ is the Fermi constant and $G_X$ is the\nfield strength of the $\\nu_s$HI model. Using this model we can also probe other\nnew physics scenarios. We find that the region allowed by the $(g-2)_\\mu$\ndiscrepancy is entirely ruled out for $M_X\\lesssim 100$ MeV. Finally, the\nsecret interaction of sterile neutrinos has been to solve a conflict between\nthe sterile neutrinos and cosmology. It is shown here that such an interaction\nis excluded by MINOS for $g^\\prime_s> 1.6\\times10^{-2}$. This exclusion,\nhowever, does depend on the value of $g_l^{\\prime}$.\n", "  We calculate leading-order medium photon yields from a quark-gluon plasma\nusing (3+1)-dimensional anisotropic hydrodynamics. Non-equilibrium corrections\nto the photon rate are taken into account using a self-consistent modification\nof the particle distribution functions and the corresponding anisotropic\nhard-loop fermionic self-energies. We present predictions for the high-energy\nphoton spectrum and photon elliptic flow as a function of transverse momentum,\nshear viscosity, and initial momentum-space anisotropy. Our findings indicate\nthat high-energy photon production is sensitive to the assumed level of initial\nmomentum-space anisotropy of the quark-gluon plasma. As a result, it may be\npossible to experimentally constrain the early-time momentum-space anisotropy\nof the quark-gluon plasma generated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions using\nhigh-energy photon yields.\n", "  We analyze circumgalactic medium (CGM) in a suite of high-resolution\ncosmological re-simulations of a Milky-Way size galaxy and show that CGM\nproperties are quite sensitive to details of star formation--feedback loop\nmodelling. The simulation that produces a realistic late-type galaxy, fails to\nreproduce existing observations of the CGM. In contrast, simulation that does\nnot produce a realistic galaxy has the predicted CGM in better agreement with\nobservations. This illustrates that properties of galaxies and properties of\ntheir CGM provide strong ${\\it complementary}$ constraints on the processes\ngoverning galaxy formation. Our simulations predict that column density\nprofiles of ions are well described by an exponential function of projected\ndistance $d$: $N \\propto e^{-d/h_s}$. Simulations thus indicate that the sharp\ndrop in absorber detections at larger distances in observations does not\ncorrespond to a \"boundary\" of an ion, but reflects the underlying steep\nexponential column density profile. Furthermore, we find that ionization energy\nof ions is tightly correlated with the scale height $h_s$: $h_s \\propto E_{\\rm\nion}^{0.74}$. At $z \\approx 0$, warm gas traced by low-ionization species\n(e.g., Mg II and C IV) has $ h_s \\approx 0.03-0.07 R_{\\rm vir}$, while higher\nionization species (O VI and Ne VIII) have $h_s \\approx 0.32-0.45R_{\\rm vir}$.\nFinally, the scale heights of ions in our simulations evolve slower than the\nvirial radius for $z\\leq 2$, but similarly to the halo scale radius, $r_s$.\nThus, we suggest that the column density profiles of galaxies at different\nredshifts should be scaled by $r_s$ rather than the halo virial radius.\n", "  We investigate Schwinger pair production in spatially inhomogeneous electric\nbackgrounds. A critical point for the onset of pair production can be\napproached by fields that marginally provide sufficient electrostatic energy\nfor an off-shell long-range electron-positron fluctuation to become a real\npair. Close to this critical point, we observe features of universality which\nare analogous to continuous phase transitions in critical phenomena with the\npair-production rate serving as an order parameter: electric backgrounds can be\nsubdivided into universality classes and the onset of pair production exhibits\ncharacteristic scaling laws. An appropriate design of the electric background\nfield can interpolate between power-law scaling, essential BKT-type scaling and\na power-law scaling with log corrections. The corresponding critical exponents\nonly depend on the large-scale features of the electric background, whereas the\nmicroscopic details of the background play the role of irrelevant perturbations\nnot affecting criticality.\n", "  We revisit the problem of full counting statistics of particles on a segment\nof a one-dimensional gas of free fermions. Using a combination of analytical\nand numerical methods, we study the crossover between the counting of discrete\nparticles and of the continuous particle density as a function of smoothing in\nthe counting procedure. In the discrete-particle limit, the result is given by\nthe Fisher--Hartwig expansion for Toeplitz determinants, while in the\ncontinuous limit we recover the bosonization results. This example of full\ncounting statistics with smoothing is also related to orthogonality\ncatastrophe, Fermi-edge singularity and non-equilibrium bosonization.\n", "  Characterizing the 125 GeV Higgs is a critical component of the physics\nprogram at the LHC Run II. In this Letter, we consider $t\\bar{t}H$ associated\nproduction in the dileptonic mode. We demonstrate that the difference in\nazimuthal angle between the leptons from top decays can directly reveal the\nCP-structure of the top-Higgs coupling with the sensitivity of the measurement\nsubstantiality enhanced in the boosted Higgs regime. We first show how to\naccess this channel via $H \\to b\\bar{b}$ jet-substructure tagging, then\ndemonstrate the ability of the new variable to measure CP. Our analysis\nincludes all signal and background samples simulated via the MC@NLO algorithm\nincluding hadronization and underlying-event effects. Using boosted Higgs\nsubstructure with dileptonic tops, we find that the top-Higgs coupling strength\nand the CP structure can be directly probed with achievable luminosity at the\n13 TeV LHC.\n", "  Time-of-flight neutron spectroscopy has been used to determine the\ncrystalline electric field (CEF) Hamiltonian, eigenvalues and eigenvectors\nappropriate to the $J$ = 7/2 Yb$^{3+}$ ion in the candidate quantum spin ice\npyrochlore magnet $\\rm Yb_2Ti_2O_7$. The precise ground state (GS) of this\nexotic, geometrically-frustrated magnet is known to be sensitive to weak\ndisorder associated with the growth of single crystals from the melt. Such\nmaterials display weak \"stuffing\" wherein a small proportion, $\\approx$ 2\\%, of\nthe non-magnetic Ti$^{4+}$ sites are occupied by excess Yb$^{3+}$. We have\ncarried out neutron spectroscopic measurements on a stoichiometric powder\nsample of Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, as well as a crushed single crystal with weak\nstuffing and an approximate composition of Yb$_{2+x}$Ti$_{2-x}$O$_{7+y}$ with\n$x$ = 0.046. All samples display three CEF transitions out of the GS, and the\nGS doublet itself is identified as primarily composed of m$_J$ = $\\pm$1/2, as\nexpected. However,\"stuffing\" at low temperatures in\nYb$_{2+x}$Ti$_{2-x}$O$_{7+y}$ induces a similar finite CEF lifetime as is\ninduced in stoichiometric Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ by elevated temperature. We\nconclude that an extended strain field exists about each local \"stuffed\" site,\nwhich produces a distribution of random CEF environments in the lightly stuffed\nYb$_{2+x}$Ti$_{2-x}$O$_{7+y}$, in addition to producing a small fraction of\nYb-ions in defective environments with grossly different CEF eigenvalues and\neigenvectors.\n", "  We present results from {\\gamma}-ray observations of the Coma cluster\nincorporating 6 years of Fermi-LAT data and the newly released {\\emph{Pass 8}}\nevent-level analysis. Our analysis of the region reveals low-significance\nresidual structures within the virial radius of the cluster that are too faint\nfor a detailed investigation with the current data. Using a likelihood approach\nthat is free of assumptions on the spectral shape we derive upper limits on the\n{\\gamma}-ray flux that is expected from energetic particle interactions in the\ncluster. We also consider a benchmark spatial and spectral template motivated\nby models in which the observed radio halo is mostly emission by secondary\nelectrons. In this case, the median expected and observed upper limits for the\nflux above 100 MeV are $1.7\\times10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{ph\\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$ and\n$5.2\\times10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{ph\\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$ respectively (the latter\ncorresponds to residual emission at the level of 1.8{\\sigma}). These bounds are\ncomparable to or higher than predicted levels of hadronic gamma-ray emission in\ncosmic-ray models with or without reacceleration of secondary electrons,\nalthough direct comparisons are sensitive to assumptions regarding the origin\nand propagation mode of cosmic rays and magnetic field properties. The minimal\nexpected {\\gamma}-ray flux from radio and star-forming galaxies within the Coma\ncluster is roughly an order of magnitude below the median sensitivity of our\nanalysis.\n", "  Many attempts have already been made for detecting exomoons around transiting\nexoplanets but the first confirmed discovery is still pending. The experience\nthat have been gathered so far allow us to better optimize future space\ntelescopes for this challenge, already during the development phase. In this\npaper we focus on the forthcoming CHaraterising ExOPlanet Satellite\n(CHEOPS),describing an optimized decision algorithm with step-by-step\nevaluation, and calculating the number of required transits for an exomoon\ndetection for various planet-moon configurations that can be observable by\nCHEOPS. We explore the most efficient way for such an observation which\nminimizes the cost in observing time. Our study is based on PTV observations\n(photocentric transit timing variation, Szab\\'o et al. 2006) in simulated\nCHEOPS data, but the recipe does not depend on the actual detection method, and\nit can be substituted with e.g. the photodynamical method for later\napplications. Using the current state-of-the-art level simulation of CHEOPS\ndata we analyzed transit observation sets for different star-planet-moon\nconfigurations and performed a bootstrap analysis to determine their detection\nstatistics. We have found that the detection limit is around an Earth-sized\nmoon. In the case of favorable spatial configurations, systems with at least\nsuch a large moon and with at least Neptune-sized planet, 80\\% detection chance\nrequires at least 5-6 transit observations on average. There is also non-zero\nchance in the case of smaller moons, but the detection statistics deteriorates\nrapidly, while the necessary transit measurements increase fast. (abridged)\n", "  Recently interest in GUT baryogenesis has been resurrected due to the\nobservation that B-violating dimension seven operators that arise in grand\nunified theories that also violate B-L produce baryon asymmetry that cannot be\nwiped out by sphaleron processes. While a general analysis of such higher\ndimensional operators from a bottom up approach exists in the literature, a\nfull analysis of them derived from grand unification does not exist. In this\nwork we present a complete analysis of B-L=-2 operators within a realistic\nSO(10) grand unification where the doublet-triplet splitting is automatic via a\nmissing partner mechanism. Specifically we compute all allowed dimension five,\ndimension seven and dimension nine operators arising from matter-Higgs\ninteractions. The relative strength of all the allowed B-L=-2 operators is\ngiven. Such interactions are useful in the study of neutrino masses,\nbaryogenesis, proton decay and $n-\\bar n$ oscillations within a common\nrealistic grand unification framework.\n", "  We investigate the claim that the ratio {\\beta} of radiation pressure force\nto gravitational force on a dust grain in our solar system can substantially\nexceed unity for some grain sizes, provided that grain porosity is high enough.\nFor model grains consisting of random aggregates of silicate spherules, we find\nthat the maximum value of {\\beta} is almost independent of grain porosity, but\nfor small (<0.3 {\\mu}m) grains, {\\beta} actually decreases with increasing\nporosity. We also investigate the effect of metallic iron and amorphous carbon\ninclusions in the dust grains and find that while these inclusions do increase\nthe radiation pressure cross-section, {\\beta} remains below unity for grains\nwith 3 pg of silicate material. These results affect the interpretation of the\ngrain trajectories estimated from the {\\it Stardust} mission, which were\nmodeled assuming {\\beta} values exceeding one. We find that radiation pressure\neffects are not large enough for particles Orion and Hylabrook captured by {\\it\nStardust} to be of interstellar origin given their reported impact velocities.\nWe also consider the effects of solar radiation on transverse velocities and\ngrain spin, and show that radiation pressure introduces both transverse\nvelocities and equatorial spin velocities of several hundred meters per second\nfor incoming interstellar grains at 2 AU. These transverse velocities are not\nimportant for modeling trajectories, but such spin rates may result in\ncentrifugal disruption of aggregates.\n", "  We investigate the response of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a polymer\nquantized massless scalar field in flat spacetime, using the propagator\nobtained by Hossain, Husain and Seahra. As this propagator violates Lorentz\ninvariance, frames moving at different constant velocities are no longer\nequivalent. This means that it is possible in principle for even an observer\nmoving at constant velocity to detect radiation. We show that such an observer\nindeed detects radiation. Remarkably, we show that the rate of this radiation\ndoes not decrease with the decrease in the characteristic length scale of\npolymer quantization. Thus the radiation cannot be suppressed by making the\npolymer length scale arbitrarily small. Our results should bring this theory\nwithin the ambit of low-energy experiments and place a lower limit on the\ncharacteristic polymer length scale.\n", "  We propose that the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry can be naturally\nproduced as a byproduct of axion-driven slow-roll inflation by coupling the\naxion to standard-model neutrinos. We assume that GUT scale right-handed\nneutrinos are responsible for the masses of the standard model neutrinos and\nthat the Higgs field is light during inflation and develops a Hubble scale\nvacuum expectation value (VEV). In this set up, the rolling axion generates a\nhelicity asymmetry in standard-model neutrinos. Following inflation, this\nhelicity asymmetry becomes equal to a net lepton number as the Higgs VEV decays\nand is partially re-processed by the $SU(2)_{L}$ sphaleron into a net baryon\nnumber.\n", "  Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have emerged as valuable tools for\nsensing and polarizing spins. Motivated by potential applications in chemistry,\nbiology, and medicine, we show that NV-based sensors are capable of detecting\nsingle spin targets even if they undergo diffusive motion in an ambient thermal\nenvironment. Focusing on experimentally relevant diffusion regimes, we derive\nan effective model for the NV-target interaction, where parameters entering the\nmodel are obtained from numerical simulations of the target motion. The\npracticality of our approach is demonstrated by analyzing two realistic\nexperimental scenarios: (i) time-resolved sensing of a fluorine nuclear spin\nbound to an N-heterocyclic carbene-ruthenium (NHC-Ru) catalyst that is\nimmobilized on the diamond surface and (ii) detection of an electron spin label\nby an NV center in a nanodiamond, both attached to a vibrating chemokine\nreceptor in thermal motion. We find in particular that the detachment of a\nfluorine target from the NHC-Ru carrier molecule can be monitored with a time\nresolution of a few seconds.\n", "  It is now established that the major source of electroweak symmetry breaking\n(EWSB) is due to the observed Higgs particle. However, whether the Higgs\nmechanism is responsible for the generation of all the fermion masses, in\nparticular, the fermions of the first two generations, is an open question. In\nthis letter we present a construction where the light fermion masses are\ngenerated through a secondary, subdominant and sequestered source of EWSB. This\nfits well with the approximate U(2) global symmetry of the observed structure\nof the flavor sector. We first realize the above idea using a calculable two\nHiggs doublet model. We then show that the first two generation masses could\ncome from technicolor dynamics, while the third generation fermions, as well as\nthe electroweak gauge bosons get their masses dominantly from the Higgs\nmechanism. We also discuss how the small CKM mixing between the first two\ngenerations and the third generation, and soft mixing between the sequestered\nEWSB components arise in this setup. A typical prediction of this scenario is a\nsignificant reduction of the couplings of the observed Higgs boson to the first\ntwo generation of fermions.\n", "  Quantum repeater networks have attracted attention for the implementation of\nlong-distance and large-scale sharing of quantum states. Recently, researchers\nextended classical network coding, which is a technique for throughput\nenhancement, into quantum information. The utility of quantum network coding\n(QNC) has been shown under ideal conditions, but it has not been studied\npreviously under conditions of noise and shortage of quantum resources. We\nanalyzed QNC on a butterfly network, which can create end-to-end Bell pairs at\ntwice the rate of the standard quantum network repeater approach. The joint\nfidelity of creating two Bell pairs has a small penalty for QNC relative to\nentanglement swapping. It will thus be useful when we care more about\nthroughput than fidelity. We found that the output fidelity drops below 0.5\nwhen the initial Bell pairs have fidelity F < 0.90, even with perfect local\ngates. Local gate errors have a larger impact on quantum network coding than on\nentanglement swapping.\n", "  Strongly-magnetized, rapidly-rotating neutron stars are contenders for the\ncentral engines of both long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) and\nhydrogen-poor super-luminous supernovae (SLSNe-I). Models for typical (~minute\nlong) LGRBs invoke magnetars with high dipole magnetic fields (Bd > 1e15 G) and\nshort spin-down times, while models for SLSNe-I invoke neutron stars with\nweaker fields and longer spin-down times of weeks. Here we identify a\ntransition region in the space of Bd and birth period for which a magnetar can\npower both a long GRB and a luminous SN. In particular, we show that a 2 ms\nperiod magnetar with a spin-down time of ~1e4 s can explain the observations of\nboth the ultra-long GRB 111209 and its associated luminous SN2011kl. For\nmagnetars with longer spin down times, we predict even longer duration (~1e6 s)\nGRBs and brighter supernovae, a correlation that extends to Swift J2058+05\n(commonly interpreted as a tidal disruption event). We further show that\nprevious estimates of the maximum rotational energy of a proto-magnetar were\ntoo conservative and energies up to Emax ~1-2e53 erg are possible. The magnetar\nmodel can therefore comfortably accommodate the extreme energy requirements\nrecently posed by the most luminous supernova ASASSN-15lh. The high ionization\nflux from a pulsar wind nebula powering ASASSN-15lh may lead to an \"ionization\nbreak-out\" X-ray burst over the coming months, which would be accompanied by an\nabrupt change in the optical spectrum. We conclude by briefly contrasting\nmillisecond magnetar and black hole models for SLSNe and ultra-long GRBs.\n", "  We consider macroscopic correlations in a bipartite system consisting of 2N\nparticles described by a generalised probabilistic theory. In particular, we\ndiscuss a case of N PR-boxes shared between two parties. We characterise\nmacroscopic measurements as collective measurements of the same property on all\nthe boxes in the same region. Such measurements are assumed to reveal only the\naverage value of the measured collective property. We show that for two\nmeasurements per observer and N greater or equal 2 there always exist a joint\nprobability distribution explaining all observable data and therefore the\nsystem admits local hidden variables. Next, we generalise this result to\ninclude measurement of fluctuations and additional measurement settings.\nFinally, we discuss our result in the context of previous works in which\ncontradictory results were presented.\n", "  We measure the top quark mass in dilepton final states of top-antitop events\nin proton-antiproton collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV, using data corresponding\nto an integrated luminosity of 9.7 fb^-1 at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider. The\nanalysis features a comprehensive optimization of the neutrino weighting method\nto minimize the statistical uncertainties. We also improve the calibration of\njet energies using the calibration determined in top-antitop to lepton+jets\nevents, which reduces the otherwise limiting systematic uncertainty from the\njet energy scale. The measured top quark mass is mt = 173.32 +/- 1.36(stat) +/-\n0.85(syst) GeV.\n", "  We analyse the probability densities of daily rainfall amounts at a variety\nof locations on the Earth. The observed distributions of the amount of rainfall\nfit well to a q-exponential distribution with exponent q close to q=1.3. We\ndiscuss possible reasons for the emergence of this power law. On the contrary,\nthe waiting time distribution between rainy days is observed to follow a\nnear-exponential distribution. A careful investigation shows that a\nq-exponential with q=1.05 yields actually the best fit of the data. A Poisson\nprocess where the rate fluctuates slightly in a superstatistical way is\ndiscussed as a possible model for this. We discuss the extreme value statistics\nfor extreme daily rainfall, which can potentially lead to flooding. This is\ndescribed by Frechet distributions as the corresponding distributions of the\namount of daily rainfall decay with a power law. On the other hand, looking at\nextreme event statistics of waiting times between rainy days (leading to\ndroughts for very long dry periods) we obtain from the observed\nnear-exponential decay of waiting times an extreme event statistics close to\nGumbel distributions. We discuss superstatistical dynamical systems as simple\nmodels in this context.\n", "  Here we propose to exploit the low energy bandwidth, small wavelength and\npenetration power of ultrashort pulses from XFELs for resonant Small Angle\nScattering (SAXS) on plasma structures in laser excited plasmas. Small angle\nscattering allows to detect nanoscale density fluctuations in forward\nscattering direction. Typically, the SAXS signal from laser excited plasmas is\nexpected to be dominated by the free electron distribution. We propose that the\nionic scattering signal becomes visible when the X-ray energy is in resonance\nwith an electron transition between two bound states (Resonant coherent X-ray\ndiffraction, RCXD). In this case the scattering cross-section dramatically\nincreases so that the signal of X-ray scattering from ions silhouettes against\nthe free electron scattering background which allows to measure the opacity and\nderived quantities with high spatial and temporal resolution, being\nfundamentally limited only by the X-ray wavelength and timing. Deriving\nquantities such as ion spatial distribution, charge state distribution and\nplasma temperature with such high spatial and temporal resolution will make a\nvast number of processes in shortpulse laser-solid interaction accessible for\ndirect experimental observation e.g. hole-boring and shock propagation,\nfilamentation and instability dynamics, electron transport, heating and\nultrafast ionization dynamics.\n", "  Many phenomena of strongly correlated materials are encapsulated in the\nFermi-Hubbard model whose thermodynamical properties can be computed from its\ngrand canonical potential according to standard procedures. In general, there\nis no closed form solution for lattices of more than one spatial dimension, but\nsolutions can be approximated with cluster perturbation theory. To model\nlong-range effects such as order parameters, a powerful method to compute the\ncluster's Green's function consists in finding its self-energy through a\nvariational principle of the grand canonical potential. This opens the\npossibility of studying various phase transitions at finite temperature in the\nFermi-Hubbard model. However, a classical cluster solver quickly hits an\nexponential wall in the memory (or computation time) required to store the\ncomputation variables. Here it is shown theoretically that that the cluster\nsolver can be mapped to a subroutine on a quantum computer whose quantum memory\nscales as the number of orbitals in the simulated cluster. A quantum computer\nwith a few tens of qubits could therefore simulate the thermodynamical\nproperties of complex fermionic lattices inaccessible to classical\nsupercomputers.\n", "  The complex interdigitated phases have greatly frustrated attempts to\ndocument the basic features of the superconductivity in the alkali metal\nintercalated iron chalcogenides. Here, using elastic neutron scattering,\nenergy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and resistivity measurements, we\nelucidate the relations of these phases in\nRb$_{1-\\delta}$Fe$_y$Se$_{2-z}$S$_z$. We find: i) the iron content is crucial\nin stabilizing the stripe antiferromagnetic (AF) phase with rhombic iron\nvacancy order ($y\\approx1.5$), the block AF phase with $\\sqrt{5}\\times\n\\sqrt{5}$ iron vacancy order ($y\\approx1.6$), and the iron vacancy-free phase\n($y\\approx2$); ii) the superconducting phase ($z=0$) evolves into a metallic\nphase ($z>1.5$) with sulfur substitution due to the progressive decrease of the\nelectronic correlation strength. Both the stripe AF phase and the block AF\nphase are Mott insulators. Our data suggest that there are miscibility gaps\nbetween these three phases. The existence of the miscibility gaps in the iron\ncontent is the key to understanding the relationship between these complicated\nphases.\n", "  A systematic search for multicomponent crystal structures is carried out for\nfive different ternary systems of nuclei in a polarizable background of\nelectrons, representative of accreted neutron star crusts and some white\ndwarfs. Candidate structures are \"bred\" by a genetic algorithm, and optimized\nat constant pressure under the assumption of linear response (Thomas-Fermi)\ncharge screening. Subsequent phase equilibria calculations reveal eight\ndistinct crystal structures in the $T=0$ bulk phase diagrams, five of which are\ncomplicated multinary structures not before predicted in the context of compact\nobject astrophysics. Frequent instances of geometrically similar but\ncompositionally distinct phases give insight into structural preferences of\nsystems with pairwise Yukawa interactions, including and extending to the\nregime of low density colloidal suspensions made in a laboratory. As an\napplication of these main results, we self-consistently couple the phase\nstability problem to the equations for a self-gravitating, hydrostatically\nstable white dwarf, with fixed overall composition. To our knowledge, this is\nthe first attempt to incorporate complex multinary phases into the equilibrium\nphase layering diagram and mass-radius-composition dependence, both of which\nare reported for He-C-O and C-O-Ne white dwarfs. Finite thickness interfacial\nphases (\"interphases\") show up at the boundaries between single-component bcc\ncrystalline regions, some of which have lower lattice symmetry than cubic. A\nsecond application -- quasi-static settling of heavy nuclei in white dwarfs --\nbuilds on our equilibrium phase layering method. Tests of this nonequilibrium\nmethod reveal extra phases which play the role of transient host phases for the\nsettling species.\n", "  It is well known that area pulses make Rabi oscillation and chirped pulses in\nthe adiabatic interaction regime induce complete population inversion of a\ntwo-state system. Here we show that chirped zero-area pulses could engineer an\ninterplay between the adiabatic evolution and Rabi-like oscillations. In a\nproof-of-principle experiment utilizing spectral chirping of femtosecond laser\npulses with a resonant spectral hole, we demonstrate that the chirped zero-area\npulses could induce, for example, complete population inversion and return of\nthe cold rubidium atom two-state system. Experimental result agrees well with\nthe theoretically considered overall dynamics, which could be approximately\nmodeled to a Ramsey-like three-pulse interaction, where the $x$- and $z$-\nrotations are respectively driven by the hole and the main pulse.\n", "  We use a recently obtained resummed quark propagator at finite temperature\nwhich takes into account both the chromoelectric scale gT and the\nchromomagnetic scale g^2T through the Gribov action. The electric scale\ngenerates two massive modes whereas the magnetic scale produces a new massless\nspacelike mode in the medium. Moreover, the non-perturbative quark propagator\nis found to contain no discontinuity in contrast to the standard perturbative\nhard thermal loop approach. Using this non-perturbative quark propagator and\nself-consistent vertices, we compute the non-perturbative dilepton rate at\nvanishing three-momentum at one-loop order. The resulting rate has a rich\nstructure at low energies due to the inclusion of the non-perturbative magnetic\nscale. We also calculate the quark number susceptibility, which is related to\nthe conserved quark number density fluctuation in the deconfined state. Both\nthe dilepton rate and quark number susceptibility are compared with results\nfrom lattice quantum chromodynamics and the standard hard thermal loop\napproach. Finally, we discuss how the absence of a discontinuity in the\nimaginary part of the non-perturbative quark propagator makes the results for\nboth dilepton production and quark number susceptibility dramatically different\nfrom those in perturbative approaches and seemingly in conflict with known\nlattice data.\n", "  The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm was originally\ndesigned to efficiently compute the zero temperature or ground-state properties\nof one dimensional strongly correlated quantum systems. The development of the\nalgorithm at finite temperature has been a topic of much interest, because of\nthe usefulness of thermodynamics quantities in understanding the physics of\ncondensed matter systems, and because of the increased complexity associated\nwith efficiently computing temperature-dependent properties. The ancilla method\nis a DMRG technique that enables the computation of these thermodynamic\nquantities. In this paper, we review the ancilla method, and improve its\nperformance by working on reduced Hilbert spaces and using canonical\napproaches. We furthermore explore its applicability beyond spins systems to\nt-J and Hubbard models.\n", "  We present static meson-meson and baryon--anti-baryon potentials in Z(2) and\nZ(3) random center vortex models for the infrared sector of Yang-Mills theory,\ni.e., hypercubic lattice models of random vortex world-surfaces. In particular,\nwe calculate Polyakov loop correlators of two static mesons resp.\n(anti-)baryons in a center vortex background and observe that their expectation\nvalues follow the minimal area law and show bond rearrangement behavior. The\nstatic meson-meson and baryon--anti-baryon potentials are compared with\ntheoretical predictions and lattice QCD simulations.\n", "  The robust estimation of the tiny distortions (shears) of galaxy shapes\ncaused by weak gravitational lensing in the presence of much larger shape\ndistortions due to the point-spread function (PSF) has been widely\ninvestigated. One major problem is that most galaxy shape measurement methods\nare subject to bias due to pixel noise in the images (\"noise bias\"). Noise bias\nis usually characterized using uncorrelated noise fields; however, real images\ntypically have low-level noise correlations due to galaxies below the detection\nthreshold, and some types of image processing can induce further noise\ncorrelations. We investigate the effective detection significance and its\nimpact on noise bias in the presence of correlated noise for one method of\ngalaxy shape estimation. For a fixed noise variance, the biases in galaxy shape\nestimates can differ substantially for uncorrelated versus correlated noise.\nHowever, use of an estimate of detection significance that accounts for the\nnoise correlations can almost entirely remove these differences, leading to\nconsistent values of noise bias as a function of detection significance for\ncorrelated and uncorrelated noise. We confirm the robustness of this finding to\nproperties of the galaxy, the PSF, and the noise field, and quantify the impact\nof anisotropy in the noise correlations. Our results highlight the importance\nof understanding the pixel noise model and its impact on detection\nsignificances when correcting for noise bias on weak lensing.\n", "  We demonstrate and contrast two approaches to the stabilization of qubit\nentanglement by feedback. Our demonstration is built on a feedback platform\nconsisting of two superconducting qubits coupled to a cavity which are measured\nby a nearly-quantum-limited measurement chain and controlled by high-speed\nclassical logic circuits. This platform is used to stabilize entanglement by\ntwo nominally distinct schemes: a \"passive\" reservoir engineering method and an\n\"active\" correction based on conditional parity measurements. In view of the\ninstrumental roles that these two feedback paradigms play in quantum\nerror-correction and quantum control, we directly compare them on the same\nexperimental setup. Further, we show that a second layer of feedback can be\nadded to each of these schemes, which heralds the presence of a high-fidelity\nentangled state in realtime. This \"nested\" feedback brings about a marked\nentanglement fidelity improvement without sacrificing success probability.\n", "  Machine learning techniques are applied to make prediction models of the G0W0\nband-gaps for 156 AX binary compounds using Kohn-Sham band-gaps and other\nfundamental information of constituent elements and crystal structure as\npredictors. Ordinary least square regression (OLSR), least absolute shrinkage\nand selection operator (LASSO) and non-linear support vector regression (SVR)\nmethods are applied with several levels of predictor sets. When the Kohn-Sham\nband-gap by GGA (PBE) or modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ) is used as a single\npredictor, OLSR model predicts the G0W0 band-gap of a randomly selected test\ndata with the root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.54 eV. When Kohn-Sham band gap\nby PBE and mBJ methods are used together with a set of various forms of\npredictors representing constituent elements and crystal structures, RMSE\ndecreases significantly. The best model by SVR yields the RMSE of 0.18 eV. A\nlarge set of band-gaps estimated in this way should be useful as predictors for\nmaterials exploration.\n", "  Column density (N) PDFs serve as a powerful tool to characterize the physical\nprocesses that influence the structure of molecular clouds. Star-forming clouds\ncan best be characterized by lognormal PDFs for the lower N range and a\npower-law tail for higher N, commonly attributed to turbulence and self-gravity\nand/or pressure, respectively. We report here on PDFs obtained from\nobservations of 12CO, 13CO, C18O, CS, and N2H+ in the Cygnus X North region and\ncompare to a PDF derived from dust observations with the Herschel satellite.\nThe PDF of 12CO is lognormal for Av~1-30, but is cut for higher Av due to\noptical depth effects. The PDFs of C18O and 13CO are mostly lognormal up for\nAv~1-15, followed by excess up to Av~40. Above that value, all CO PDFs drop,\nmost likely due to depletion. The high density tracers CS and N2H+ exhibit only\na power law distribution between Av~15 and 400, respectively. The PDF from dust\nis lognormal for Av~3-15 and has a power-law tail up to Av~500. Absolute values\nfor the molecular line column densities are, however, rather uncertain due to\nabundance and excitation temperature variations. Taken the dust PDF face value,\nwe 'calibrate' the molecular line PDF of CS to the one of the dust and\ndetermined an abundance [CS]/[H2] of 10^-9. The slopes of the power-law tails\nof the CS, N2H+, and dust PDFs are consistent with free-fall collapse of\nfilaments and clumps. A quasi static configuration of filaments and clumps can\npossibly also account for the observed N-PDFs, as long as they have a\nsufficiently condensed density structure and external ram pressure by gas\naccretion is provided. The somehow flatter slopes of N2H+ and CS can reflect an\nabundance change and/or subthermal excitation at low column densities.\n", "  In the framework of Born-Infeld inspired gravity theories, which deviates\nfrom General Relativity (GR) in the high curvature regime, we discuss the\nviability of Cosmic Inflation without scalar fields. For energy densities\nhigher than the new mass scale of the theory, a gravitating dust component is\nshown to generically induce an accelerated expansion of the Universe. Within\nsuch a simple scenario, inflation gracefully exits when the GR regime is\nrecovered, but the Universe would remain matter dominated. In order to\nimplement a reheating era after inflation, we then consider inflation to be\ndriven by a mixture of unstable dust species decaying into radiation. Because\nthe speed of sound gravitates within the Born-Infeld model under consideration,\nour scenario ends up being predictive on various open questions of the\ninflationary paradigm. The total number of e-folds of acceleration is given by\nthe lifetime of the unstable dust components and is related to the duration of\nreheating. As a result, inflation does not last much longer than the number of\ne-folds of deceleration allowing a small spatial curvature and large scale\ndeviations to isotropy to be observable today. Energy densities are\nself-regulated as inflation can only start for a total energy density less than\na threshold value, again related to the species' lifetime. Above this\nthreshold, the Universe may bounce thereby avoiding a singularity. Another\ndistinctive feature is that the accelerated expansion is of the\nsuperinflationary kind, namely the first Hubble flow function is negative. We\nshow however that the tensor modes are never excited and the tensor-to-scalar\nratio is always vanishing, independently of the energy scale of inflation.\n", "  We report on NuSTAR and Swift observations of a soft state of the neutron\nstar low-mass X-ray binary GS 1826-24, commonly known as the \"clocked\" burster.\nThe transition to the soft state was recorded in 2014 June through an increase\nof the 2-20 keV source intensity measured by MAXI, simultaneous with a decrease\nof the 15-50 keV intensity measured by Swift/BAT. The episode lasted\napproximately two months, after which the source returned to its usual hard\nstate. We analyze the broad-band spectrum measured by Swift/XRT and NuSTAR, and\nestimate the accretion rate during the soft episode to be about 13% of\nEddington, within the range of previous observations. However, the best fit\nspectral model, adopting the double Comptonization used previously, exhibits\nsignificantly softer components. We detect seven type-I X-ray bursts, all\nsignificantly weaker (and with shorter rise and decay times) than observed\npreviously. The burst profiles and recurrence times vary significantly, ruling\nout the regular bursts that are typical for this source. One burst exhibited\nphotospheric radius expansion, and we estimate the source distance at about\n(5.7 / xi_b^1/2) kpc, where xi_b parameterizes the possible anisotropy of the\nburst emission. Interpreting the soft state as a transition from an optically\nthin inner flow to an optically thick flow passing through a boundary layer, as\nis commonly observed in similar systems, is contradicted by the lower optical\ndepth measured for the double Comptonization model we find for this soft state.\nThe effect of a change in disk geometry on the burst behavior remains unclear.\n", "  We develop here a procedure to obtain regular static configurations as\nresulting from dynamical gravitational collapse of a massive matter cloud in\ngeneral relativity. Under certain general physical assumptions for the\ncollapsing cloud, we find the class of dynamical models that lead to an\nequilib- rium configuration. To illustrate this, we provide a class of perfect\nfluid collapse models that lead to a static constant density object as limit.\nWe suggest that similar models might possibly constitute the basis for the\ndescription of formation of compact objects in nature.\n", "  For future space infrared astronomical coronagraphy, we perform experimental\nstudies on the application of aluminum mirrors to a coronagraph. Cooled\nreflective optics is required for broad-band mid-infrared observations in\nspace, while high-precision optics is required for coronagraphy. For the\ncoronagraph instrument originally proposed for the next-generation infrared\nastronomical satellite project SPICA (SCI: SPICA Coronagraph Instrument), we\nfabricated and evaluated the optics consisting of high-precision aluminum\noff-axis mirrors with diamond-turned surfaces, and conducted a coronagraphic\ndemonstration experiment using the optics with a coronagraph mask. We first\nmeasured the wave front errors (WFEs) of the aluminum mirrors with a He-Ne\nFizeau interferometer to confirm that the power spectral densities of the WFEs\nsatisfy the SCI requirements. Then we integrated the mirrors into an optical\nsystem and evaluated the overall performance of the system. As a result, we\nestimate the total WFE of the optics to be 33 nm (rms), each mirror\ncontributing 10-20 nm (rms) for the central 14 mm area of the optics, and\nobtain a contrast of 10^(-5.4) as a coronagraph in the visible light. At a\nwavelength of 5 um, the coronagraphic system is expected to achieve a contrast\nof ~10^(-7) based on our model calculation with the measured optical\nperformance. Thus our experiment demonstrates that aluminum mirror optics is\napplicable to a highly WFE-sensitive instrument such as a coronagraph in space.\n", "  Everyday experience supports the existence of physical properties independent\nof observation in strong contrast to the predictions of quantum theory. In\nparticular, existence of physical properties that are independent of the\nmeasurement context is prohibited for certain quantum systems. This property is\nknown as contextuality. This paper studies whether the process of decay in\nspace-time generally destroys the ability of revealing contextuality. We find\nthat in the most general situation the decay property does not diminish this\nability. However, applying certain constraints due to the space-time structure\neither on the time evolution of the decaying system or on the measurement\nprocedure, the criteria revealing contextuality become inherently dependent on\nthe decay property or an impossibility. In particular, we derive how the\ncontext-revealing setup known as Bell's nonlocality tests changes for decaying\nquantum systems. Our findings illustrate the interdependence between hidden and\nlocal hidden parameter theories and the role of time.\n", "  Delay-coordinate reconstruction is a proven modeling strategy for building\neffective forecasts of nonlinear time series. The first step in this process is\nthe estimation of good values for two parameters, the time delay and the\nembedding dimension. Many heuristics and strategies have been proposed in the\nliterature for estimating these values. Few, if any, of these methods were\ndeveloped with forecasting in mind, however, and their results are not optimal\nfor that purpose. Even so, these heuristics---intended for other\napplications---are routinely used when building delay coordinate\nreconstruction-based forecast models. In this paper, we propose a new strategy\nfor choosing optimal parameter values for forecast methods that are based on\ndelay-coordinate reconstructions. The basic calculation involves maximizing the\nshared information between each delay vector and the future state of the\nsystem. We illustrate the effectiveness of this method on several synthetic and\nexperimental systems, showing that this metric can be calculated quickly and\nreliably from a relatively short time series, and that it provides a direct\nindication of how well a near-neighbor based forecasting method will work on a\ngiven delay reconstruction of that time series. This allows a practitioner to\nchoose reconstruction parameters that avoid any pathologies, regardless of the\nunderlying mechanism, and maximize the predictive information contained in the\nreconstruction.\n", "  The Extremely Large Telescopes currently under construction have a collecting\narea that is an order of magnitude larger than the present largest optical\ntelescopes. For seeing-limited observations the performance will scale as the\ncollecting area but, with the successful use of adaptive optics, for many\napplications it will scale as $D^4$ (where $D$ is the diameter of the primary\nmirror). Central to the success of the ELTs, therefore, is the successful use\nof multi-conjugate adaptive optics (MCAO) that applies a high degree correction\nover a field of view larger than the few arcseconds that limits classical\nadaptive optics systems. In this letter, we report on the analysis of crowded\nfield images taken on the central region of the Galactic globular cluster NGC\n1851 in $K_s$ band using GeMS at the Gemini South telescope, the only\nscience-grade MCAO system in operation. We use this cluster as a benchmark to\nverify the ability to achieve precise near-infrared photometry by presenting\nthe deepest $K_s$ photometry in crowded fields ever obtained from the ground.\nWe construct a colour-magnitude diagram in combination with the F606W band from\nHST/ACS. As well as detecting the \"knee\" in the lower main sequence at\n$K_s\\simeq20.5$, we also detect the double subgiant branch of NGC 1851, that\ndemonstrates the high photometric accuracy of GeMS in crowded fields.\n", "  Phase transitions can modify quantum behaviour on mesoscopic scales and give\naccess to new and unusual quantum dynamics. Here we investigate the superfluid\nproperties of a rotating two-component Bose--Einstein condensate as a function\nof changes in the interaction energy and in particular through the phase\ntransition from miscibility to immiscibility. We show that the breaking of one\nof the hallmarks of superfluid flow, namely the quantisation condition on\ncirculation, is continuous throughout an azimuthal phase separation process and\ndisplays intriguing density dynamics. We find that the resulting currents are\nstable for long times and possess a phase boundary that exhibits classical\nsolid body rotation, despite the quantum nature of superfluid flow. To support\nthis co-existence of classical and quantum behaviour the system develops a\nunique velocity flow profile, which includes unusual radial flow in regions\nnear the phase boundary.\n", "  Common density-matrix functionals, the M\\\"uller and the power functional,\nhave been benchmarked for the half-filled Hubbard dimer, which allows to model\nthe bond dissociation problem and the transition from the weakly to the\nstrongly correlated limit. Unbiased numerical calculations are combined with\nanalytical results. Despite the well known successes of the M\\\"uller\nfunctional, the ground state is degenerate with a one-dimensional manifold of\nferromagnetic solutions. The resulting infinite magnetic susceptibility\nindicates another qualitative flaw of M\\\"uller's functional. The derivative\ndiscontinuity with respect to particle number is not present indicating an\nincorrect metal-like behavior. The power functional actually favors the\nferromagnetic state for weak interaction. Analogous to the Hartree-Fock\napproximation, the power functional undergoes a transition beyond a critical\ninteraction strength, in this case however, to a non-collinear\nantiferromagnetic state.\n", "  A conformal field theory (CFT) in dimension $d\\geq 3$ coupled to a planar,\ntwo-dimensional, conformal defect is characterized in part by a \"central\ncharge\" $b$ that multiplies the Euler density in the defect's Weyl anomaly. For\ndefect renormalization group flows, under which the bulk remains critical, we\nuse reflection positivity to show that $b$ must decrease or remain constant\nfrom ultraviolet to infrared. Our result applies also to a CFT in $d=3$ flat\nspace with a planar boundary.\n", "  We review the physics of purely leptonic decays of $\\pi^\\pm$, $K^\\pm$,\n$D^{\\pm}$, $D_s^\\pm$, and $B^\\pm$ pseudoscalar mesons. The measured decay rates\nare related to the product of the relevant weak-interaction-based CKM matrix\nelement of the constituent quarks and a strong interaction parameter related to\nthe overlap of the quark and antiquark wave-functions in the meson, called the\ndecay constant $f_P$. The leptonic decay constants for $\\pi^\\pm$, $K^\\pm$,\n$D^{\\pm}$, $D_s^\\pm$, and $B^\\pm$ mesons can be obtained with controlled\ntheoretical uncertainties and high precision from {\\it ab initio} lattice-QCD\nsimulations. The combination of experimental leptonic decay-rate measurements\nand theoretical decay-constant calculations enables the determination of\nseveral elements of the CKM matrix within the standard model. These\ndeterminations are competitive with those obtained from semileptonic decays,\nand also complementary because they are sensitive to different quark\nflavor-changing currents. They can also be used to test the unitarity of the\nfirst and second rows of the CKM matrix. Conversely, taking the CKM elements\npredicted by unitarity, one can infer \"experimental\" values for $f_P$ that can\nbe compared with theory. These provide tests of lattice-QCD methods, provided\nnew-physics contributions to leptonic decays are negligible at the current\nlevel of precision. This review is the basis of the article in the Particle\nData Group's 2016 edition, updating the versions in Refs. [1-3].\n", "  We consider a thought experiment where the preparation of a macroscopically\nmassive or charged particle in a quantum superposition and the associated\ndynamics of a distant test particle apparently allow for superluminal\ncommunication. We give a solution to the paradox which is based on the\nfollowing fundamental principle: any local experiment, discriminating a\ncoherent superposition from an incoherent statistical mixture, necessarily\nrequires a minimum time proportional to the mass (or charge) of the system. For\na charged particle, we consider two examples of such experiments, and show that\nthey are both consistent with the previous limitation. In the first, the\nmeasurement requires to accelerate the charge, that can entangle with the\nemitted photons. In the second, the limitation can be ascribed to the quantum\nvacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. On the other hand, when\napplied to massive particles our result provides an indirect evidence for the\nexistence of gravitational vacuum fluctuations and for the possibility of\nentangling a particle with quantum gravitational radiation.\n", "  The CDMS low ionization threshold experiment (CDMSlite) uses cryogenic\ngermanium detectors operated at a relatively high bias voltage to amplify the\nphonon signal in the search for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs).\nResults are presented from the second CDMSlite run with an exposure of 70 kg\ndays, which reached an energy threshold for electron recoils as low as 56 eV. A\nfiducialization cut reduces backgrounds below those previously reported by\nCDMSlite. New parameter space for the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross\nsection is excluded for WIMP masses between 1.6 and 5.5 GeV/$c^2$.\n", "  We explore to what extent path-integral quantum Monte Carlo methods can\nefficiently simulate the tunneling behavior of quantum adiabatic optimization\nalgorithms. Specifically we look at symmetric cost functions defined over n\nbits with a single potential barrier that a successful optimization algorithm\nwill have to tunnel through. The height and width of this barrier depend on n,\nand by tuning these dependencies, we can make the optimization algorithm\nsucceed or fail in polynomial time. In this article we compare the strength of\nquantum adiabatic tunneling with that of path-integral quantum Monte Carlo\nmethods. We find numerical evidence that quantum Monte Carlo algorithms will\nsucceed in the same regimes where quantum adiabatic optimization succeeds.\n", "  We argue that topological Kondo insulators can also have 'intrinsic'\ntopological order associated with fractionalized excitations on their surfaces.\nThe hydridization between the local moments and conduction electrons can weaken\nnear the surface, and this enables the local moments to form spin liquids. This\nco-exists with the conduction electron surface states, realizing a surface\nfractionalized Fermi liquid. We present mean-field solutions of a\nKondo-Heisenberg model which display such surfaces.\n", "  We introduce a fully-coherent method for searching for gravitational wave\nsignals generated by the merger of black hole and/or neutron star binaries.\nThis extends the coherent analysis previously developed and used for targeted\ngravitational wave searches to an all-sky, all-time search. We apply the search\nto one month of data taken during the fifth science run of the LIGO detectors.\nWe demonstrate an increase in sensitivity of 25% over the coincidence search,\nwhich is commensurate with expectations. Finally, we discuss prospects for\nimplementing and running a coherent search for gravitational wave signals from\nbinary coalescence in the advanced gravitational wave detector data.\n", "  Until the late 1980s, phases of matter were understood in terms of Landau's\nsymmetry breaking theory. Following the discovery of the quantum Hall effect\nthe introduction of a second class of phases, those with topological order, was\nnecessary. Phase transitions within the first class of phases involve a change\nin symmetry, whereas those between topological phases require a change in\ntopological order. However, in rare cases transitions may occur between the two\nclasses in which the vanishing of the topological order is accompanied by the\nemergence of a broken symmetry. Here, we report the existence of such a\ntransition in a two-dimensional electron gas hosted by a GaAs/AlGaAs crystal.\nWhen tuned by hydrostatic pressure, the $\\nu=5/2$ fractional quantum Hall\nstate, believed to be a prototype non-Abelian topological phase, gives way to a\nquantum Hall nematic phase. Remarkably, this nematic phase develops\nspontaneously, in the absence of any externally applied symmetry breaking\nfields.\n", "  Homogeneous and isotropic, nonsingular, bouncing world models are designed to\nevade the initial singularity at the beginning of the cosmic expansion. Here,\nwe study the thermodynamics of the subset of these models governed by general\nrelativity. Considering the entropy of matter, radiation and that the entropy\nof the apparent horizon is proportional to its area, we argue that these models\ndo not respect the generalised second law of thermodynamics, also away from the\nbounce.\n", "  We report on a study of topological properties of Fibonacci quasicrystals.\nChern numbers which label the dense set of spectral gaps, are shown to be\nrelated to the underlying palindromic symmetry. Topological and spectral\nfeatures are related to the two independent phases of the scattering matrix:\nthe total phase shift describing the frequency spectrum and the chiral phase\nsensitive to topological features. Conveniently designed gap modes with\nspectral properties directly related to the Chern numbers allow to scan these\nphases. An effective topological Fabry-Perot cavity is presented.\n", "  Introducing nanoparticles into superconducting materials has emerged as an\nefficient route to enhance their current-carrying capability. We address the\nproblem of optimizing vortex pinning landscape for randomly distributed\nmetallic spherical inclusions using large-scale numerical simulations of\ntime-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations. We found the size and density of\nparticles for which the highest critical current is realized in a fixed\nmagnetic field. For each particle size and magnetic field, the critical current\nreaches a maximum value at a certain particle density, which typically\ncorresponds to 15-23% of the total volume being replaced by nonsuperconducting\nmaterial. For fixed diameter, this optimal particle density increases with the\nmagnetic field. Moreover, we found that the optimal particle diameter slowly\ndecreases with the magnetic field from 4.5 to 2.5 coherence lengths at a given\ntemperature. This result shows that pinning landscapes have to be designed for\nspecific applications taking into account relevant magnetic field scales.\n", "  We introduce three tunable parameters to optimize the fidelity of quantum\nteleportation with continuous-variable in nonideal scheme. Using the\ncharacteristic function formalism, we present the condition that the\nteleportation fidelity is independent of the amplitude of input coherent states\nfor any entangled resource. Then we investigate the effects of tunable\nparameters on the fidelity with or without the presence of environment and\nimperfect measurements, by analytically deriving the expression of fidelity for\nthree different input coherent state distributions. It is shown that, for the\nlinear distribution, the optimization with three tunable parameters is the best\none with respect to single- and two-parameter optimization. Our results reveal\nthe usefulness of tunable parameters for improving the fidelity of\nteleportation and the ability against the decoherence.\n", "  The aim of this note is to provide a pedagogical survey of the recent works\nby the authors ( arXiv:1409.7548 and arXiv:1507.06013) concerning the local\nbehavior of the eigenvalues of large complex correlated Wishart matrices at the\nedges and cusp points of the spectrum: Under quite general conditions, the\neigenvalues fluctuations at a soft edge of the limiting spectrum, at the hard\nedge when it is present, or at a cusp point, are respectively described by mean\nof the Airy kernel, the Bessel kernel, or the Pearcey kernel. Moreover, the\neigenvalues fluctuations at several soft edges are asymptotically independent.\nIn particular, the asymptotic fluctuations of the matrix condition number can\nbe described. Finally, the next order term of the hard edge asymptotics is\nprovided.\n", "  We consider the constrained Schelling model of social segregation in which\nthe utility factor of agents strictly increases and non-local jumps of the\nagents are allowed. In the present study, the utility factor u is defined in a\nway such that it can take continuous values and depends on the tolerance\nthreshold as well as the fraction of unlike neighbours. Two models are\nproposed: in model A the jump probability is determined by the sign of u only\nwhich makes it equivalent to the discrete model. In model B the actual values\nof u are considered. Model A and model B are shown to differ drastically as far\nas segregation behaviour and phase transitions are concerned. In model A,\nalthough segregation can be achieved, the cluster sizes are rather small. Also,\na frozen state is obtained in which steady states comprise of many unsatisfied\nagents. In model B, segregated states with much larger cluster sizes are\nobtained. The correlation function is calculated to show quantitatively that\nlarger clusters occur in model B. Moreover for model B, no frozen states exist\neven for very low dilution and small tolerance parameter. This is in contrast\nto the unconstrained discrete model considered earlier where agents can move\neven when utility remains same. In addition, we also consider a few other\ndynamical aspects which have not been studied in segregation models earlier.\n", "  We extend the null background construction of\n[arXiv:1505.05677,arXiv:1509.04718] to include torsion and a conserved spin\ncurrent, and use it to study gauge and gravitational anomalies in Galilean\ntheories coupled to torsional Newton-Cartan backgrounds. We establish that the\nrelativistic anomaly inflow mechanism with an appropriately modified anomaly\npolynomial, can be used to generate these anomalies. Similar to relativistic\ncase, we find that Galilean anomalies also survive only in even dimensions.\nFurther, these anomalies only effect the gauge and rotational symmetries of a\nGalilean theory; in particular the Milne boost symmetry remains non-anomalous.\nWe also extend the transgression machinery used in relativistic fluids to\nfluids on null backgrounds, and use it to determine how these anomalies affect\nthe constitutive relations of a Galilean fluid.\n  Unrelated to Galilean fluids, we propose an analogue of the off-shell second\nlaw of thermodynamics for relativistic fluids introduced by [arXiv:1106.0277],\nto include torsion and a conserved spin current in Vielbein formalism.\nInterestingly, we find that even in absense of spin and torsion the entropy\ncurrents in two formalisms are different; while the usual entropy current gets\na contribution from gravitational anomaly, the entropy current in Vielbein\nformalism does not have any anomaly induced part.\n", "  Using an attractive surface delta interaction we obtain wave functions for 2\nneutrons (or neutron holes) in the model space of 2 orbits (l=4, j=7/2) and\n(l=2, j=5/2). If we take the single particle energies to be degenerate we find\nthat the g factors for I=2, 4 and 6 are all the same -namely the orbital g\nfactor of the single nucleon. For a free neutron this quantity zero all\n2particle or 2 hole g factors are equal to zero as well.. Only the orbital part\nof the g -factors contribute - the spin part cancels out. We then consider the\neffects of introducing a single energy splititng between the 2 orbits. We\nspeculate that g factors for all n can be obtained by a linear approximation.\n", "  Hastings established exponential decay of correlations for ground states of\ngapped quantum many-body systems. A ground state of a (geometrically) local\nHamiltonian with spectral gap $\\epsilon$ has correlation length $\\xi$ upper\nbounded as $\\xi=O(1/\\epsilon)$. In general this bound cannot be improved. Here\nwe study the scaling of the correlation length as a function of the spectral\ngap in frustration-free local Hamiltonians, and we prove a tight bound\n$\\xi=O(1/\\sqrt\\epsilon)$ in this setting. This highlights a fundamental\ndifference between frustration-free and frustrated systems near criticality.\nThe result is obtained using an improved version of the combinatorial proof of\ncorrelation decay due to Aharonov, Arad, Vazirani, and Landau.\n", "  SN 2011ja was a bright (I = -18.3) Type II supernova occurring in the nearby\nedge on spiral galaxy NGC 4945. Flat-topped and multi-peaked H-alpha and H-beta\nspectral emission lines appear between 64 - 84 days post-explosion, indicating\ninteraction with a disc-like circumstellar medium inclined 30-45 degrees from\nedge-on. After day 84 an increase in the H- and K-band flux along with heavy\nattenuation of the red wing of the emission lines are strong indications of\nearly dust formation, likely located in the cool dense shell created between\nthe forward shock of the SN ejecta and the reverse shock created as the ejecta\nplows into the existing CSM. Radiative transfer modeling reveals both ~1.5 x\n10^-4 Msun of pre-existing dust located ~ 10^16.7 cm away and ~ 5 x 10^-5 Msun\nof newly formed dust. Spectral observations after 1.5 years reveal the\npossibility that the fading SN is located within a young (3-6 Myr) massive\nstellar cluster, which when combined with tentative 56Ni mass estimates of 0.2\nMsun may indicate a massive (> 25 Msun) progenitor for SN 2011ja.\n", "  The review addresses the spatial frequency morphology of sources of sunspot\noscillations and waves, including their localization, size, oscillation\nperiods, height localization with the mechanism of cut-off frequency that forms\nthe observed emission variability. Dynamic of sunspot wave processes, provides\nthe information about the structure of wave fronts and their time variations,\ninvestigates the oscillation frequency transformation depending on the wave\nenergy is shown. The initializing solar flares caused by trigger agents like\nmagnetoacoustic waves, accelerated particle beams, and shocks are discussed.\nSpecial attention is paid to the relation between the flare reconnection\nperiodic initialization and the dynamics of sunspot slow magnetoacoustic waves.\nA short review of theoretical models of sunspot oscillations is provided.\n", "  The effective Hamiltonian formalism is extended to vectorial electromagnetic\nwaves in order to describe statistical properties of the field in reverberation\nchambers. The latter are commonly used in electromagnetic compatibility tests.\nAs a first step, the distribution of wave intensities in chaotic systems with\nvarying opening in the weak coupling limit for scalar quantum waves is derived\nby means of random matrix theory. In this limit the only parameters are the\nmodal overlap and the number of open channels. Using the extended effective\nHamiltonian, we describe the intensity statistics of the vectorial\nelectromagnetic eigenmodes of lossy reverberation chambers. Finally, the\ntypical quantity of interest in such chambers, namely, the distribution of the\nelectromagnetic response, is discussed. By determining the distribution of the\nphase rigidity, describing the coupling to the environment, using random matrix\nnumerical data, we find good agreement between the theoretical prediction and\nnumerical calculations of the response.\n", "  The quantum marginal problem asks whether a set of given density matrices are\nconsistent, i.e., whether they can be the reduced density matrices of a global\nquantum state. Not many non-trivial analytic necessary (or sufficient)\nconditions are known for the problem in general. We propose a method to detect\nconsistency of overlapping quantum marginals by considering the separability of\nsome derived states. Our method works well for the $k$-symmetric extension\nproblem in general, and for the general overlapping marginal problems in some\ncases. Our work is, in some sense, the converse to the well-known $k$-symmetric\nextension criterion for separability.\n", "  We use galaxy-galaxy lensing to study the dark matter halos surrounding a\nsample of Locally Brightest Galaxies (LBGs) selected from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey. We measure mean halo mass as a function of the stellar mass and colour\nof the central galaxy. Mock catalogues constructed from semi-analytic galaxy\nformation simulations demonstrate that most LBGs are the central objects of\ntheir halos, greatly reducing interpretation uncertainties due to satellite\ncontributions to the lensing signal. Over the full stellar mass range, $10.3 <\n\\log [M_*/M_\\odot] < 11.6$, we find that passive central galaxies have halos\nthat are at least twice as massive as those of star-forming objects of the same\nstellar mass. The significance of this effect exceeds $3\\sigma$ for $\\log\n[M_*/M_\\odot] > 10.7$. Tests using the mock catalogues and on the data\nthemselves clarify the effects of LBG selection and show that it cannot\nartificially induce a systematic dependence of halo mass on LBG colour. The\nbimodality in halo mass at fixed stellar mass is reproduced by the\nastrophysical model underlying our mock catalogue, but the sign of the effect\nis inconsistent with recent, nearly parameter-free age-matching models. The\nsign and magnitude of the effect can, however, be reproduced by halo occupation\ndistribution models with a simple (few-parameter) prescription for\ntype-dependence.\n", "  We show that initially localized and uncorrelated two-particles quantum\nwavepackets evolving in a one-dimensional discrete lattice become strongly\nentangled while drifting under the action of an harmonic AC field resonant with\ndoubled Bloch oscillations promoted by a static DC field. Although partial\nentanglement is achieved when the AC field is resonant with the single-particle\nBloch oscillations, it is strongly limited by the survival of anti-correlated\nunbounded states. We further show that the phase dependence of the wavepacket\ncentroid velocity is similar to the semiclassical behavior depicted by a\nsingle-particle. However, the drift velocity exhibits a non-trivial\nnon-monotonic dependence on the interaction strength, vanishing in the limit of\nuncorrelated particles, that unveils its competing influence on unbounded and\nbounded states.\n", "  We show that the string backgrounds AdS2 x S2 x T6 and AdSd x Sd x Sd x T{10\n- 3d} (d = 2, 3) are self-dual under a series of bosonic and fermionic\nT-dualities. We do this using the fermionic Buscher rules derived by Berkovits\nand Maldacena, thus working at the level of the supergravity fields. This\nallows us to explicitly track the behaviour of the RR fields, from which we see\nthat we need T-duality along some torus directions. For the AdS x S x S cases,\nwhich contain cosets of D(2,1;alpha), it is necessary to perform bosonic\nT-duality along some complexified Killing spinors in one of the spheres.\n", "  The observation of long-range collective correlations for particles emitted\nin high-multiplicity pp and pPb collisions has opened up new opportunities of\ninvestigating novel high-density QCD phenomena in small colliding systems. We\nreview experimental results related to the studies of collective phenomena in\nsmall systems from RHIC and the LHC over the past several years. Latest\ndevelopment in theoretical interpretations motivated by different frameworks\nare also reviewed, and confronted with the experimental data. Perspectives on\npossible future directions are discussed, with the aim of further exploring the\nrich emergent QCD phenomena.\n", "  Quantum cryptography holds the promise to establish an\ninformation-theoretically secure global network. All field tests of\nmetropolitan-scale quantum networks to date are based on trusted relays. The\nsecurity critically relies on the accountability of the trusted relays, which\nwill break down if the relay is dishonest or compromised. Here, we construct a\nmeasurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDIQKD) network in a\nstar topology over a 200 square kilometers metropolitan area, which is secure\nagainst untrustful relays and against all detection attacks. In the field test,\nour system continuously runs through one week with a secure key rate ten times\nlarger than previous result. Our results demonstrate that the MDIQKD network,\ncombining the best of both worlds --- security and practicality, constitutes an\nappealing solution to secure metropolitan communications.\n", "  In the topic of perfect local distinguishability of orthogonal multipartite\nquantum states, most results obtained so far pertain to bipartite systems whose\nsubsystems are of specific dimensions. In contrast very few results for\nbipartite systems whose subsystems are of arbitrary dimensions, are known. This\nis because a rich variety of (algebraic or geometric) structure is exhibited by\ndifferent sets of orthogonal states owing to which it is difficult to associate\nsome common property underlying them all, i.e., a common property that would\nplay a crucial role in the local distinguishability of these states. In this\npaper, I propose a framework for the distinguishability by one-way LOCC\n($1$-LOCC) of sets of orthogonal bipartite states in a $d_A \\otimes d_B$\nbipartite system, where $d_A, d_B$ are the dimensions of both subsytems,\nlabelled as $A$ and $B$. I show that if the $i$-th party (where $i=A,B$) can\ninitiate a $1$-LOCC protocol to perfectly distinguish among a set of orthogonal\nbipartite states, then the information of the existence of such a $1$-LOCC\nprotocol lies in a subspace of $d_i \\times d_i$ hermitian matrices, denoted by\n$\\Tb^{(i)}$, and that the method to extract this information (of the existence\nof this $1$-LOCC protocol) from $\\Tb^{(i)}$ depends on the value of $dim\n\\Tb^{(i)}$. In this way one can give sweeping results for the $1$-LOCC\n(in)distinguishability of all sets of orthogonal bipartite states corresponding\nto certain values of $dim \\Tb^{(i)}$. Thus I propose that the value of $dim\n\\Tb^{(i)}$ gives the common underlying property based on which sweeping results\nfor the $1$-LOCC (in)distinguishability of orthogonal bipartite quantum states\ncan be made.\n", "  We demonstrate how quantum optimal control can be used to enhance quantum\nresources for bipartite one-way protocols, specifically EPR-steering with qubit\nmeasurements. Steering is relevant for one-sided device-independent key\ndistribution, the realistic implementations of which necessitate the study of\nnoisy scenarios. So far mainly the case of imperfect detection efficiency has\nbeen considered; here we look at the effect of dynamical noise responsible for\ndecoherence and dissipation. In order to set up the optimisation, we map the\nsteering problem into the equivalent joint measurability problem, and employ\nquantum resource-theoretic robustness monotones from that context. The\nadvantage is that incompatibility (hence steerability) with arbitrary pairs of\nnoisy qubit measurements has been completely characterised through an\nanalytical expression, which can be turned into a computable cost function with\nexact gradient. Furthermore, dynamical loss of incompatibility has recently\nbeen illustrated using these monotones. We demonstrate resource control\nnumerically using a special gradient-based software, showing, in particular,\nthe advantage over naive control with cost function chosen as a fidelity in\nrelation to a specific target. We subsequently illustrate the complexity of the\ncontrol landscapes with a simplified two-variable scheme. The results\ncontribute to the theoretical understanding of the limitations in realistic\nimplementations of quantum information protocols, also paving way to practical\nuse of the rather abstract quantum resource theories.\n", "  The inner regions of the most massive compact stellar objects might be\noccupied by a phase of quarks. Since the observations of the massive pulsars\nPSR J1614-2230 and of PSR J0348+0432 with about two solar masses, the equations\nof state constructing relativistic stellar models have to be constrained\nrespecting these new limits. We discuss stable hybrid stars, i.e. compact\nobjects with an outer layer composed of nuclear matter and with a core\nconsisting of quark matter (QM). For the outer nuclear layer we utilize a\ndensity dependent nuclear equation of state and we use a chiral SU(3)\nQuark-Meson model with a vacuum energy pressure to describe the objects core.\nThe appearance of a disconnected mass-radius branch emerging from the hybrid\nstar branch implies the existence of a third family of compact stars, so called\ntwin stars. Twin stars did not emerge as the transition pressure has to be\nrelatively small with a large jump in energy density, which could not be\nsatisfied within our approach. This is, among other reasons, due to the fact\nthat the speed of sound in QM has to be relatively high, which can be\naccomplished by an increase of the repulsive coupling. This increase on the\nother hand yields too high transition pressures for twins stars to appear.\n", "  We study the symmetry of the class of nonlocal models which includes the\nnonlocal extension of the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator. As a consequence, we\nobtain an infinite dimensional symmetry algebra, containing the Virasoro\nalgebra, which can be considered as a generalization of the non-relativistic\nconformal symmetries to the infinite order. Moreover, this nonlocal extension\nresembles to some extent the string model and on the quantum level it leads to\nthe centrally extended Virasoro algebra.\n", "  The process $e^+e^- \\to K^+K^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ has been studied in the\ncenter-of-mass energy range from 1500 to 2000\\,MeV using a data sample of 23\npb$^{-1}$ collected with the CMD-3 detector at the VEPP-2000 $e^+e^-$ collider.\nUsing about 24000 selected events, the $e^+e^- \\to K^+K^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ cross\nsection has been measured with a systematic uncertainty decreasing from 11.7\\%\nat 1500-1600\\,MeV to 6.1\\% above 1800\\,MeV. A preliminary study of\n$K^+K^-\\pi^+\\pi^-$ production dynamics has been performed.\n", "  Large Kuiper Belt Objects are conventionally thought to have formed out of a\nmassive planetesimal belt that is a few thousand times its current mass. Such a\npicture, however, is incompatible with multiple lines of evidence. Here, we\npresent a new model for the conglomeration of Cold Classical Kuiper belt\nobjects, out of a solid belt only a few times its current mass, or a few\npercent of the solid density in a Minimum Mass Solar Nebula. This is made\npossible by depositing most of the primordial mass in grains of size centimetre\nor smaller. These grains collide frequently and maintain a dynamically cold\nbelt out of which large bodies grow efficiently: an order-unity fraction of the\nsolid mass can be converted into large bodies, in contrast to the ~0.1%\nefficiency in conventional models. Such a light belt may represent the true\nouter edge of the Solar system, and it may have effectively halted the outward\nmigration of Neptune. In addition to the high efficiency, our model can also\nproduce a mass spectrum that peaks at an intermediate size, similar to the\nobserved Cold Classicals, if one includes the effect of cratering collisions.\nIn particular, the observed power-law break observed at ~30 km for Cold\nClassicals, one that has been interpreted as a result of collisional erosion,\nmay be primordial in origin.\n", "  We consider an isolated vortex in the two-dimensional proximity-induced\nsuperconducting state formed at the interface of a three-dimensional strong\ntopological insulator (TI) and an s-wave superconductor (sSC). Prior\ncalculations of the bound states of this system famously revealed a zero-energy\nstate that is its own conjugate, a Majorana fermion bound to the vortex core.\nWe calculate, not the bound states, but the scattering states of this system,\nand ask how the spin-momentum-locked massless Dirac form of the single-particle\nHamiltonian, inherited from the TI surface, affects the cross section for\nscattering Bogoliubov quasiparticles from the vortex. As in the case of an\nordinary superconductor, this is a two-channel problem with the vortex mixing\nparticle-like and hole-like excitations. And as in the ordinary case, the\nsame-channel differential cross section diverges in the forward direction due\nto the Aharonov-Bohm effect, resulting in an infinite total cross section but\nfinite transport and skew cross sections. We calculate the transport and skew\ncross sections numerically, via a partial wave analysis, as a function of both\nquasiparticle excitation energy and chemical potential. Novel effects emerge as\nparticle-like or hole-like excitations are tuned through the Dirac point.\n", "  We search for a light Higgs boson $A^0$ in the fully reconstructed decay\nchain of $J/\\psi \\rightarrow \\gamma A^0$, $A^0 \\rightarrow \\mu^+\\mu^-$ using\n$(225.0\\pm2.8)\\times10^6$ $J/\\psi$ events collected by the BESIII experiment.\nThe $A^0$ is a hypothetical CP-odd light Higgs boson predicted by many\nextensions of the Standard Model including two spin-0 doublets plus an extra\nsinglet. We find no evidence for $A^0$ production and set $90\\%$\nconfidence-level upper limits on the product branching fraction\n$\\mathcal{B}(J/\\psi \\rightarrow \\gamma A^0) \\times \\mathcal{B}(A^0 \\rightarrow\n\\mu^+\\mu^-)$ in the range of $(2.8-495.3)\\times 10^{-8}$ for $0.212 \\le m_{A^0}\n\\le 3.0$ GeV/c$^2$. The new limits are $5$ times below our previous results,\nand the nature of the $A^0$ is constrained to be mostly singlet.\n", "  We report a strong thickness dependence of the complex frequency-dependent\noptical dielectric function in epitaxial CaMnO3(001) thin films on SrTiO3(001),\nLaAlO3(001), and SrLaAlO4(001) substrates. A doubling of the peak value of the\nimaginary part of the dielectric function and spectral shifts of 0.5 eV for a\ngiven magnitude of absorption are observed. On the basis of the experimental\ndata and first-principles density functional theory calculations of the\ndielectric function, its evolution with thickness from 4 to 63 nm has several\nregimes. In the thinnest, strain-coherent films, the response is characterized\nby a significant contribution from the free surface that dominates strain\neffects. However, at intermediate and larger thicknesses approaching the\nbulk-like film, strain coherence and partial strain relaxation persist and in\ninfluence the dielectric function.\n", "  We present a detection of the enhancement in the number densities of\nbackground galaxies induced from lensing magnification and use it to test the\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) inferred masses in a sample of 19 galaxy\nclusters with median redshift $z\\simeq0.42$ selected from the South Pole\nTelescope SPT-SZ survey. Two background galaxy populations are selected for\nthis study through their photometric colours; they have median redshifts\n${z}_{\\mathrm{median}}\\simeq0.9$ (low-$z$ background) and\n${z}_{\\mathrm{median}}\\simeq1.8$ (high-$z$ background). Stacking these\npopulations, we detect the magnification bias effect at $3.3\\sigma$ and\n$1.3\\sigma$ for the low- and high-$z$ backgrounds, respectively. We fit NFW\nmodels simultaneously to all observed magnification bias profiles to estimate\nthe multiplicative factor $\\eta$ that describes the ratio of the weak lensing\nmass to the mass inferred from the SZE observable-mass relation. We further\nquantify systematic uncertainties in $\\eta$ resulting from the photometric\nnoise and bias, the cluster galaxy contamination and the estimations of the\nbackground properties. The resulting $\\eta$ for the combined background\npopulations with $1\\sigma$ uncertainties is\n$0.83\\pm0.24\\mathrm{(stat)}\\pm0.074\\mathrm{(sys)}$, indicating good consistency\nbetween the lensing and the SZE-inferred masses. We use our best-fit $\\eta$ to\npredict the weak lensing shear profiles and compare these predictions with\nobservations, showing agreement between the magnification and shear mass\nconstraints. This work demonstrates the promise of using the magnification as a\ncomplementary method to estimate cluster masses in large surveys.\n", "  We present a quantum algorithm for computing the Ramsey numbers whose\ncomputational complexity grows super-exponentially with the number of vertices\nof a graph on a classical computer. The problem is mapped to a decision problem\non a quantum computer, a probe qubit is coupled to a register that represents\nthe problem and detects the energy levels of the problem Hamiltonian. The\ndecision problem is solved by determining whether the probe qubit exhibits\nresonance dynamics. The algorithm shows a quadratic speedup over its classical\ncounterparts, and the degenerate ground state problem in the adiabatic quantum\nevolution algorithm for this problem is avoided.\n", "  A review work is done for electronic and optical properties of graphene\nnanoribbons in magnetic, electric, composite, and modulated fields. Effects due\nto the lateral confinement, curvature, stacking, non-uniform subsystems and\nhybrid structures are taken into account. The special electronic properties,\ninduced by complex competitions between external fields and geometric\nstructures, include many one-dimensional parabolic subbands, standing waves,\npeculiar edge-localized states, width- and field-dependent energy gaps,\nmagnetic-quantized quasi-Landau levels, curvature-induced oscillating Landau\nsubbands, crossings and anti-crossings of quasi-Landau levels, coexistence and\ncombination of energy spectra in layered structures, and various peak\nstructures in the density of states. There exist diverse absorption spectra and\ndifferent selection rules, covering edge-dependent selection rules,\nmagneto-optical selection rule, splitting of the Landau absorption peaks,\nintragroup and intergroup Landau transitions, as well as coexistence of\nmonolayer-like and bilayer-like Landau absorption spectra. Detailed comparisons\nare made between the theoretical calculations and experimental measurements.\nThe predicted results, the parabolic subbands, edge-localized states, gap\nopening and modulation, and spatial distribution of Landau subbands, have been\nverified by various experimental measurements.\n", "  Cosmic strings formed during inflation are expected to be either diluted over\nsuper-Hubble distances, i.e., invisible today, or to have crossed our past\nlight cone very recently. We discuss the latter situation in which a few\nstrings imprint their signature in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\nAnisotropies after recombination. Being almost frozen in the Hubble flow, these\nstrings are quasi static and evade almost all of the previously derived\nconstraints on their tension while being able to source large scale\nanisotropies in the CMB sky. Using a local variance estimator on thousand of\nnumerically simulated Nambu-Goto all sky maps, we compute the expected signal\nand show that it can mimic a dipole modulation at large angular scales while\nbeing negligible at small angles. Interestingly, such a scenario generically\nproduces one cold spot from the thawing of a cosmic string loop. Mixed with\nanisotropies of inflationary origin, we find that a few strings of tension GU =\nO(1) x 10^(-6) match the amplitude of the dipole modulation reported in the\nPlanck satellite measurements and could be at the origin of other large scale\nanomalies.\n", "  I state and prove, in the context of a space having only the metrical and\naffine structure imposed by the geometrized version of Newtonian gravitational\ntheory, a theorem analagous to that of Weyl's for a Lorentz manifold. The\ntheorem says that a projective structure and a suitably defined compatible\nconformal structure jointly suffice for fixing the metric structure of a\nNewtonian spacetime model up to constant factors, and for fixing its affine\nstructure as well. The theorem allows one to give a natural, physically\ncompelling interpretation of the spatiotemporal geometry of a geometrized\nNewtonian gravity spacetime manifold, in close analogy with the way Weyl's\nTheorem allows one to do in general relativity.\n", "  Using an exact numerical solution and semiclassical analysis, we investigate\nquantum oscillations (QOs) in a model of a bilayer system with an anisotropic\n(elliptical) electron pocket in each plane. Key features of QO experiments in\nthe high temperature superconducting cuprate YBCO can be reproduced by such a\nmodel, in particular the pattern of oscillation frequencies (which reflect\n\"magnetic breakdown\" between the two pockets) and the polar and azimuthal\nangular dependence of the oscillation amplitudes. However, the requisite\nmagnetic breakdown is possible only under the assumption that the horizontal\nmirror plane symmetry is spontaneously broken and that the bilayer tunneling,\n$t_\\perp$, is substantially renormalized from its `bare' value. Under the\nassumption that $t_\\perp= \\tilde{Z}t_\\perp^{(0)}$, where $\\tilde{Z}$ is a\nmeasure of the quasiparticle weight, this suggests that $\\tilde{Z} \\lesssim\n1/20$. Detailed comparisons with new YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.58}$ QO data, taken\nover a very broad range of magnetic field, confirm specific predictions made by\nthe breakdown scenario.\n", "  We consider right-handed neutrino dark matter $N_1$ in local\n$U(1)_{L_\\mu-L_\\tau}$-extended Ma model. With the light $U(1)_{\\mu-\\tau}$ gauge\nboson ($m_{Z'} \\sim {\\cal O}(100)$ MeV) and small $U(1)_{\\mu-\\tau}$ gauge\ncoupling ($g_{Z'}\\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$) which can accommodate the muon $(g-2)$\nanomaly and is still allowed by other experimental constraints, we show that we\ncan get correct relic density of dark matter for wide range of dark matter mass\n($M_1 \\sim 10-100$ GeV), although the gauge coupling constant $g_{Z'}$ is\nsmall. This is due to the fact that the annihilation cross section of dark\nmatter pair is enhanced by $M_1^4/m_{Z'}^4$ in the processes $N_1 N_1 \\to Z'\nZ'$ or $N_1 N_1 \\to Z' H_2$. We also consider the constraints from direct\ndetection, collider searches.\n", "  Hole-doped high-temperature cuprate superconductors below optimum doping have\nsmall electron-like Fermi surfaces occupying a small fraction of the Brillouin\nzone. There is strong evidence that this is linked to charge density wave (CDW)\norder, which reconstructs the large hole-like Fermi surfaces predicted by band\nstructure calculations . Recent experiments have revealed the structure of the\ntwo CDW components in the benchmark bilayer material YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$ in\nhigh field where quantum oscillation (QO) measurements are performed. We have\ncombined these results with a tight-binding description of the bands in an\nisolated bilayer to give a minimal model revealing the essential physics of the\nsituation. Here we show that this approach, combined with the effects of\nspin-orbit interactions and the pseudogap, gives a good qualitative description\nof the multiple frequencies seen in the QO observations in this material.\nMagnetic breakdown through weak CDW splitting of the bands will lead to a\nfield-dependence of the QO spectrum and to the observed fourfold symmetry of\nthe results in tilted fields.\n", "  We formulate a spin-polarized van Leeuwen and Baerends (vLB) correction to\nthe local density approximation (LDA) exchange potential [Phys. Rev. A 49, 2421\n(1994)] that enforces the ionization potential (IP) theorem following Stein et\nal. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 266802 (2010)]. For electronic-structure problems,\nthe vLB-correction replicates the behavior of exact-exchange potentials, with\nimproved scaling and well-behaved asymptotics, but with the computational cost\nof semi-local functionals. The vLB+IP corrections produces large improvement in\nthe eigenvalues over that from LDA due to correct asympotic behavior and atomic\nshell structures, as shown on rare-gas, alkaline-earth, zinc-based oxides,\nalkali-halides, sulphides, and nitrides. In half-Heusler alloys, this\nasymptotically-corrected LDA reproduces the spin-polarized properties\ncorrectly, including magnetism and half-metallicity. We also considered\nfinite-sized systems [e.g., ringed boron-nitirde (B$_{12}$N$_{12}$) and\ngraphene (C$_{24}$)] to emphasize the wide applicability of the method.\n", "  We consider a coupled-cavity array, where each cavity interacts with an atom\nunder the rotating-wave approximation. For a staggered pattern of inter-cavity\ncouplings, a pair of field normal modes each bi-localized at the two array ends\narise. A rich structure of dynamical regimes can hence be addressed depending\non which resonance condition between the atom and field modes is set. We show\nthat this can be harnessed to carry out high-fidelity quantum-state transfer\n(QST) of photonic, atomic or polaritonic states. Moreover, by partitioning the\narray into coupled modules of smaller length, the QST time can be substantially\nshortened without significantly affecting the fidelity.\n", "  We study harmonically trapped, unpolarized fermion systems with attractive\ninteractions in two spatial dimensions with spin degeneracies Nf = 2 and 4 and\nN/Nf = 1, 3, 5, and 7 particles per flavor. We carry out our calculations using\nour recently proposed quantum Monte Carlo method on a nonuniform lattice. We\nreport on the ground-state energy and contact for a range of couplings, as\ndetermined by the binding energy of the two-body system, and show explicitly\nhow the physics of the Nf-body sector dominates as the coupling is increased.\n", "  Wide parameter space searches for long lived continuous gravitational wave\nsignals are computationally limited. It is therefore critically important that\navailable computational resources are used rationally. In this paper we\nconsider directed searches, i.e. targets for which the sky position is known\naccurately but the frequency and spindown parameters are completely unknown.\nGiven a list of such potential astrophysical targets, we therefore need to\nprioritize. On which target(s) should we spend scarce computing resources? What\nparameter space region in frequency and spindown should we search? Finally,\nwhat is the optimal search set-up that we should use? In this paper we present\na general framework that allows to solve all three of these problems. This\nframework is based on maximizing the probability of making a detection subject\nto a constraint on the maximum available computational cost. We illustrate the\nmethod for a simplified problem.\n", "  We build a framework using tools from Bayesian data analysis to evaluate\nmodels explaining the periodic variations in spin-down and beam-width of PSR\nB1828-11. The available data consists of the time averaged spin-down rate,\nwhich displays a distinctive double-peaked modulation, and measurements of the\nbeam-width. Two concepts exist in the literature that are capable of explaining\nthese variations; we formulate predictive models from these and quantitatively\ncompare them. The first concept is phenomenological and stipulates that the\nmagnetosphere undergoes periodic switching between two meta-stable states as\nfirst suggested by Lyne et al. The second concept, precession, was first\nconsidered as a candidate for the modulation of B1828-11 by Stairs et al.. We\nquantitatively compare models built from these concepts using a Bayesian\nodds-ratio. Because the phenomenological switching model itself was informed by\nthis data in the first place, it is difficult to specify appropriate\nparameter-space priors that can be trusted for an unbiased model comparison.\nTherefore we first perform a parameter estimation using the spin-down data, and\nthen use the resulting posterior distributions as priors for model comparison\non the beam-width data. We find that a precession model with a simple circular\nGaussian beam geometry fails to appropriately describe the data, while allowing\nfor a more general beam geometry provides a good fit to the data. The resulting\nodds between the precession model (with a general beam geometry) and the\nswitching model are estimated as $10^{2.7 \\pm 0.5}$ in favour of the precession\nmodel.\n", "  The information content of continuous quantum variables systems is usually\nstudied using a number of well known approximation methods. The approximations\nare made to obtain the spectrum, eigenfunctions or the reduced density matrices\nthat are essential to calculate the entropy-like quantities that quantify the\ninformation. Even in the sparse cases where the spectrum and eigenfunctions are\nexactly known the entanglement spectrum, {\\em i.e.} the spectrum of the reduced\ndensity matrices that characterize the problem, must be obtained in an\napproximate fashion. In this work, we obtain analytically a finite\nrepresentation of the reduced density matrices of the fundamental state of the\nN-particle Calogero model for a discrete set of values of the interaction\nparameter. As a consequence, the exact entanglement spectrum and von Neumann\nentropy is worked out.\n", "  The differential cross-section for pair production of top quarks with high\ntransverse momentum is measured in 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions\nat a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The measurement is performed for\n$t\\bar{t}$ events in the lepton+jets channel. The cross-section is reported as\na function of the hadronically decaying top quark transverse momentum for\nvalues above 300 GeV. The hadronically decaying top quark is reconstructed as\nan anti-$k_t$ jet with radius parameter $R=1.0$ and identified with jet\nsubstructure techniques. The observed yield is corrected for detector effects\nto obtain a cross-section at particle level in a fiducial region close to the\nevent selection. A parton-level cross-section extrapolated to the full phase\nspace is also reported for top quarks with transverse momentum above 300 GeV.\nThe predictions of a majority of next-to-leading-order and leading-order\nmatrix-element Monte Carlo generators are found to agree with the measured\ncross-sections.\n", "  We study laser generation in 1D distributed feedback lasers with amplifying\nand lossy layers. We show that when the lasing frequency differs from the\ntransition frequencies of the amplifying medium, loss induced lasing may occur\ndue to the broadening of the resonator mode with increasing loss in the\nabsorbing layers. This broadening leads to a shift in the lasing frequency\ntowards the transition frequency. As a result, the cavity mode interaction with\nthe amplifying medium is enhanced, and the lasing threshold is lowered.\n", "  In general, it is difficult to evaluate measurement errors when the initial\nand final conditions of the measurement make it impossible to identify the\ncorrect value of the target observable. Ozawa proposed a solution based on the\noperator algebra of observables which has recently been used in experiments\ninvestigating the error-disturbance trade-off of quantum measurements.\nImportantly, this solution makes surprisingly detailed statements about the\nrelations between measurement outcomes and the unknown target observable. In\nthe present paper, we investigate this relation by performing a sequence of two\nmeasurements on the polarization of a photon, so that the first measurement\ncommutes with the target observable and the second measurement is sensitive to\na complementary observable. While the initial measurement can be evaluated\nusing classical statistics, the second measurement introduces the effects of\nquantum correlations between the non-commuting physical properties. By varying\nthe resolution of the initial measurement, we can change the relative\ncontribution of the non-classical correlations and identify their role in the\nevaluation of the quantum measurement. It is shown that the most striking\ndeviation from classical expectations is obtained at the transition between\nweak and strong measurements, where the competition between different\nstatistical effects results in measurement values well outside the range of\npossible eigenvalues.\n", "  We propose a series of simple $2d$ lattice interacting fermion models that we\ndemonstrate at low energy describe bosonic symmetry protected topological (SPT)\nstates and quantum phase transitions between them. This is because due to\ninteraction the fermions are gapped both at the boundary of the SPT states and\nat the bulk quantum phase transition, thus these models at low energy can be\ndescribed completely by bosonic degrees of freedom. We show that the bulk of\nthese models is described by a Sp($N$) principal chiral model with a\ntopological $\\Theta$-term, whose boundary is described by a Sp($N$) principal\nchiral model with a Wess-Zumino-Witten term at level-1. The quantum phase\ntransition between SPT states in the bulk is tuned by a particular interaction\nterm, which corresponds to tuning $\\Theta$ in the field theory, and the phase\ntransition occurs at $\\Theta = \\pi$. The simplest version of these models with\n$N=1$ is equivalent to the familiar O(4) nonlinear sigma model (NLSM) with a\ntopological term, whose boundary is a $(1+1)d$ conformal field theory with\ncentral charge $c = 1$. After breaking the O(4) symmetry to its subgroups, this\nmodel can be viewed as bosonic SPT states with U(1), or $Z_2$ symmetries, etc.\nAll these fermion models including the bulk quantum phase transitions can be\nsimulated with determinant Quantum Monte Carlo method without the sign problem.\nRecent numerical results strongly suggests that the quantum disordered phase of\nthe O(4) NLSM with precisely $\\Theta = \\pi$ is a stable $(2+1)d$ conformal\nfield theory (CFT) with gapless bosonic modes.\n", "  We obtain the lowest energy solutions for the skymion field equations and\ntheir corresponding vortex structures. Two nondegenerate solutions emerge with\ntheir vortex swirls in opposite directions. The solutions are associated with\nan extremum property, which favors an array of almost hexagonal shape. We\npredict that a regular hexagonal lattice must have a mix of skyrmions of both\nswirls. Although our solutions could not keep the norm of the magnetization\nconstant at unity, their greatest deviation from unity occurred in regions\nwhere the spins are far from planar; we show how to improve this situation.\n", "  Broadband quantum memories hold great promise as multiplexing elements in\nfuture photonic quantum information protocols. Alkali vapour Raman memories\ncombine high-bandwidth storage, on-demand read-out, and operation at room\ntemperature without collisional fluorescence noise. However, previous\nimplementations have required large control pulse energies and suffered from\nfour-wave mixing noise. Here we present a Raman memory where the storage\ninteraction is enhanced by a low-finesse birefringent cavity tuned into\nsimultaneous resonance with the signal and control fields, dramatically\nreducing the energy required to drive the memory. By engineering anti-resonance\nfor the anti-Stokes field, we also suppress the four-wave mixing noise and\nreport the lowest unconditional noise floor yet achieved in a Raman-type warm\nvapour memory, $(15\\pm2)\\times10^{-3}$ photons per pulse, with a total\nefficiency of $(9.5\\pm0.5)$%.\n", "  We consider the transient behavior of globally coupled systems of identical\npulse coupled oscillators. Synchrony develops through an aggregation\nphenomenon, with clusters of synchronized oscillators forming and growing\nlarger in time. Previous work derived expressions for these time dependent\nclusters, when each oscillator obeyed a linear charging curve. We generalize\nthese results to cases where the charging curves have nonlinearities\n", "  I review a new rapidly growing area of high-energy plasma astrophysics ---\nradiative magnetic reconnection, i.e., a reconnection regime where radiation\nreaction influences reconnection dynamics, energetics, and nonthermal particle\nacceleration. This influence be may be manifested via a number of\nastrophysically important radiative effects, such as radiation-reaction limits\non particle acceleration, radiative cooling, radiative resistivity, braking of\nreconnection outflows by radiation drag, radiation pressure, viscosity, and\neven pair creation at highest energy densities. Self-consistent inclusion of\nthese effects in magnetic reconnection theory and modeling calls for serious\nmodifications to our overall theoretical approach to the problem. In addition,\nprompt reconnection-powered radiation often represents our only observational\ndiagnostic tool for studying remote astrophysical systems; this underscores the\nimportance of developing predictive modeling capabilities to connect the\nunderlying physical conditions in a reconnecting system to observable radiative\nsignatures. This Chapter gives an overview of recent theoretical progress in\ndeveloping basic physical understanding of radiative reconnection, with a\nspecial emphasis on astrophysically important radiation mechanisms like\nsynchrotron, curvature, and inverse-Compton. It also offers a broad review of\nkey high-energy astrophysical applications of radiative reconnection, such as:\npulsar wind nebulae and magnetospheres, accreting black-hole coronae and jets\nin XRBs and AGN, magnetospheres of magnetars, and Gamma-Ray Bursts. Finally,\nthis Chapter discusses the most critical open questions and outlines the\ndirections for future research in this exciting new frontier of plasma\nastrophysics.\n", "  Low mass dwarf spheroidal galaxies are key objects for our understanding of\nthe chemical evolution of the pristine Universe and the Local Group of\ngalaxies. Abundance ratios in stars of these objects can be used to better\nunderstand their star formation and chemical evolution. We report on the\nanalysis of a sample of 11 stars belonging to 5 different ultra faint dwarf\nspheroidal galaxies (UfDSph) based on X-Shooter spectra obtained at the VLT.\nMedium resolution spectra have been used to determine the detailed chemical\ncomposition of their atmosphere. We performed a standard 1D LTE analysis to\ncompute the abundances.\n  Considering all the stars as representative of the same population of low\nmass galaxies, we found that the [alpha/Fe] ratios vs [Fe/H] decreases as the\nmetallicity of the star increases in a way similar to what is found for the\npopulation of stars belonging to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The main difference\nis that the solar [alpha/Fe] is reached at a much lower metallicity for the\nUfDSph than the dwarf spheroidal galaxies.\n  We report for the first time the abundance of strontium in CVnI. The star we\nanalyzed in this galaxy has a very high [Sr/Fe] and a very low upper limit of\nbarium which makes it a star with an exceptionally high [Sr/Ba] ratio.\n  Our results seem to indicate that the galaxies which have produced the bulk\nof their stars before the reionization (fossil galaxies) have lower [X/Fe]\nratios at a given metallicity than the galaxies that have experienced a\ndiscontinuity in their star formation rate (quenching).\n", "  First-principles calculations are employed to investigate the phonon\ntransport of BiCuOSe. Our calculations reproduce the lattice thermal\nconductivity of BiCuOSe. The calculated gruneisen parameter is 2.4~2.6 at room\ntemperature, a fairly large value indicating a strong anharmonicity in BiCuOSe,\nwhich leads to its ultralow lattice thermal conductivity. The contribution to\ntotal thermal conductivity from high-frequency optical phonons, which are\nmostly contributed by the vibrations of O atoms, is larger than 1/3, remarkably\ndifferent from the usual picture with very little contribution from\nhigh-frequency optical phonons. Our calculations show that both the high group\nvelocities and low scattering processes involved make the high-frequency\noptical modes contribute considerably to the total lattice thermal\nconductivity. In addition, we show that the sound velocity and bulk modulus\nalong $a$ and $c$ axes exhibit strong anisotropy, which results in the\nanisotropic thermal conductivity in BiCuOSe.\n", "  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has the potential to enhance our\nunderstanding of near-Earth objects (NEOs). We present results of\ninvestigations into the observability of NEOs given the nominal observing\nrequirements of JWST on elongation (85-135 degrees) and non-sidereal rates\n($<$30mas/s). We find that approximately 75% of NEOs can be observed in a given\nyear. However, observers will need to wait for appropriate observing windows.\nWe find that JWST can easily execute photometric observations of meter-sized\nNEOs which will enhance our understanding of the small NEO population.\n", "  Collapse models predict a tiny violation of energy conservation, as a\nconsequence of the spontaneous collapse of the wave function. This property\nallows to set experimental bounds on their parameters. We consider an ultrasoft\nmagnetically tipped nanocantilever cooled to millikelvin temperature. The\nthermal noise of the cantilever fundamental mode has been accurately estimated\nin the range $0.03-1$ K, and any other excess noise is found to be negligible\nwithin the experimental uncertainty. From the measured data and the cantilever\ngeometry, we estimate the upper bound on the Continuous Spontaneous\nLocalization (CSL) collapse rate in a wide range of the correlation length\n$r_C$. Our upper bound improves significantly previous constraints for\n$r_C>10^{-6}$ m, and partially excludes the enhanced collapse rate suggested by\nAdler. We discuss future improvements.\n", "  Transient fully reconfigurable photonic circuits can be introduced at the\noptical fiber surface with subangstrom precision. A building block of these\ncircuits, a 0.7 angstrom-precise nano-bottle resonator, is experimentally\ncreated by local heating, translated, and annihilated.\n", "  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), as the largest space-based\nastronomical observatory with near- and mid-infrared instrumentation, will\nelucidate many mysterious aspects of comets. We summarize four cometary science\nthemes especially suited for this telescope and its instrumentation: the\ndrivers of cometary activity, comet nucleus heterogeneity, water ice in comae\nand on surfaces, and activity in faint comets and main-belt asteroids. With\nJWST, we can expect the most distant detections of gas, especially CO2, in what\nwe now consider to be only moderately bright comets. For nearby comets, coma\ndust properties can be studied with their driving gases, measured\nsimultaneously with the same instrument or contemporaneously with another.\nStudies of water ice and gas in the distant Solar System will help us test our\nunderstanding of cometary interiors and coma evolution. The question of\ncometary activity in main-belt comets will be further explored with the\npossibility of a direct detection of coma gas. We explore the technical\napproaches to these science cases and provide simple tools for estimating comet\ndust and gas brightness. Finally, we consider the effects of the observatory's\nnon-sidereal tracking limits, and provide a list of potential comet targets\nduring the first 5 years of the mission.\n", "  In the framework of weakly-coupled pNRQCD, we derive, first, an analytical\nexpression for the chromo-polarizability of $1S$-bottomonium states in\nagreement with previous determinations. Then we use the QCD trace anomaly to\nobtain the two-pion production amplitude for the chromo-polarizability operator\nand match the result to a chiral effective field theory with $1S$-bottomonium\nstates and pions as degrees-of-freedom. In this chiral effective field theory\nwe compute some long-range properties of the $1S$ bottomonium generated by the\npion coupling such as the leading chiral logarithm to the $1S$-bottomonium mass\nand the van der Waals potential between two $1S$-bottomonium states. Both\nresults improve on previously known expressions.\n", "  We study the spectrum of the hydrogen atom in Snyder space in a semiclassical\napproximation based on a generalization of the Born-Sommerfeld quantization\nrule. While the corrections to the standard quantum mechanical spectrum arise\nat first order in the Snyder parameter for the $l=0$ states, they are of second\norder for $l\\neq 0$. This can be understood as due to the different topology of\nthe regions of integration in phase space.\n", "  This white paper examines the benefit of the upcoming James Webb Space\nTelescope for studies of the Solar System's four giant planets: Jupiter,\nSaturn, Uranus, and Neptune. JWST's superior sensitivity, combined with high\nspatial and spectral resolution, will enable near- and mid-infrared imaging and\nspectroscopy of these objects with unprecedented quality. In this paper we\ndiscuss some of the myriad scientific investigations possible with JWST\nregarding the giant planets. This discussion is preceded by the specifics of\nJWST instrumentation most relevant to giant planet observations. We conclude\nwith identification of desired pre-launch testing and operational aspects of\nJWST that would greatly benefit future studies of the giant planets.\n", "  A possibility is explored to account for the light curve and the low\nexpansion velocity of the supernova SN~2011ht, a member of group of three\nobjects showing signatures of both IIn and IIP supernovae. It is argued that\nthe radiated energy and the expansion velocity are consistent with the low\nenergy explosion ($\\approx6\\times10^{49}$ erg) and $\\leq 2 M_{\\odot}$ ejecta\ninteracting with the circumstellar envelope of $6-8 M_{\\odot}$ and the radius\nof $~2\\times10^{14}$ cm. The test of this scenario is proposed.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the opportunities provided by the James Webb\nSpace Telescope (JWST) for significant scientific advances in the study of\nsolar system bodies and rings using stellar occultations. The strengths and\nweaknesses of the stellar occultation technique are evaluated in light of\nJWST's unique capabilities. We identify several possible JWST occultation\nevents by minor bodies and rings, and evaluate their potential scientific\nvalue. These predictions depend critically on accurate a priori knowledge of\nthe orbit of JWST near the Sun-Earth Lagrange-point 2 (L2). We also explore the\npossibility of serendipitous stellar occultations by very small minor bodies as\na by-product of other JWST observing programs. Finally, to optimize the\npotential scientific return of stellar occultation observations, we identify\nseveral characteristics of JWST's orbit and instrumentation that should be\ntaken into account during JWST's development.\n", "  The MEarth Project is a photometric survey systematically searching the\nsmallest stars nearest to the Sun for transiting rocky planets. Since 2008,\nMEarth has taken approximately two million images of 1844 stars suspected to be\nmid-to-late M dwarfs. We have augmented this survey by taking nightly exposures\nof photometric standard stars and have utilized this data to photometrically\ncalibrate the $MEarth$ system, identify photometric nights, and obtain an\noptical magnitude with $1.5\\%$ precision for each M dwarf system. Each optical\nmagnitude is an average over many years of data, and therefore should be\nlargely immune to stellar variability and flaring. We combine this with\ntrigonometric distance measurements, spectroscopic metallicity measurements,\nand 2MASS infrared magnitude measurements in order to derive a\ncolor-magnitude-metallicity relation across the mid-to-late M dwarf spectral\nsequence that can reproduce spectroscopic metallicity determinations to a\nprecision of 0.1 dex. We release optical magnitudes and metallicity estimates\nfor 1567 M dwarfs, many of which did not have an accurate determination of\neither prior to this work. For an additional 277 stars without a trigonometric\nparallax, we provide an estimate of the distance assuming solar neighborhood\nmetallicity. We find that the median metallicity for a volume limited sample of\nstars within 20 parsecs of the Sun is [Fe/H] = $-0.03 \\pm 0.008$, and that 29 /\n565 of these stars have a metallicity of [Fe/H] = $-0.5$ or lower, similar to\nthe low-metallicity distribution of nearby G-dwarfs. When combined with the\nresults of ongoing and future planet surveys targeting these objects, the\nmetallicity estimates presented here will be important in assessing the\nsignificance of any putative planet-metallicity correlation.\n", "  We develop a long-term 1-D evolution model for icy satellites that couples\nmultiple processes: water migration and differentiation, geochemical reactions\nand silicate phase transitions, compaction by self-gravity, and ablation. The\nmodel further considers the following energy sources and sinks: tidal heating,\nradiogenic heating, geochemical energy released by serpentinization or absorbed\nby mineral dehydration, gravitational energy and insolation, and heat transport\nby conduction, convection, and advection. We apply the model to Enceladus, by\nguessing the initial conditions that would render a structure compatible with\npresent-day observations, assuming the initial structure to have been\nhomogeneous. Assuming the satellite has been losing water continually along its\nevolution, we postulate that it was formed as a more massive, more icy and more\nporous satellite, and gradually transformed into its present day state due to\nsustained long-term tidal heating. We consider several initial compositions and\nevolution scenarios and follow the evolution for the age of the Solar System,\ntesting the present day model results against the available observational\nconstraints. Our model shows the present configuration to be differentiated\ninto a pure icy mantle, several tens of km thick, overlying a rocky core,\ncomposed of dehydrated rock at the center and hydrated rock in the outer part.\nFor Enceladus, it predicts a higher rock/ice mass ratio than previously assumed\nand a thinner ice mantle, compatible with recent estimates based on gravity\nfield measurements. Although, obviously, the model cannot be used to explain\nlocal phenomena, it sheds light on the internal structure invoked in\nexplanations of localized features and activities.\n", "  We show universality of isothermal fluid spheres in pure Lovelock gravity\nwhere the equation of motion has only one $N$th order term coming from the\ncorresponding Lovelock polynomial action of degree $N$. Isothermality is\ncharacterized by the equation of state, $p = \\alpha \\rho$ and the property,\n$\\rho \\sim 1/r^{2N}$. Then the solution describing isothermal spheres, which\nexist only for the pure Lovelock equation, is of the same form for the general\nLovelock degree $N$ in all dimenions $d \\geq 2N+2$. We further prove that the\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the isothermal sphere is that its metric\nis conformal to the massless global monopole or the solid angle deficit metric,\nand this feature is also universal.\n", "  We have shown that it is possible to model accurately optical phenomena in\nintense laser fields by taking into account the intensity distribution over the\nlaser beam. We developed a theoretical model that divided an intense laser beam\ninto concentric regions, each with a Rabi frequency that corresponds to the\nintensity in that region, and solved a set of coupled optical Bloch equations\nfor the density matrix in each region. Experimentally obtained magneto-optical\nresonance curves for the $F_g=2\\longrightarrow F_e=1$ transition of the $D_1$\nline of $^{87}$Rb agreed very well with the theoretical model up to a laser\nintensity of around 200 mW/cm$^2$ for a transition whose saturation intensity\nis around 4.5 mW/cm$^2$. We have studied the spatial dependence of the\nfluorescence intensity in an intense laser beam experimentally and\ntheoretically. An experiment was conducted whereby a broad, intense pump laser\nexcited the $F_g=4\\longrightarrow F_e=3$ transition of the $D_2$ line of cesium\nwhile a weak, narrow probe beam scanned the atoms within the pump beam and\nexcited the $D_1$ line of cesium, whose fluorescence was recorded as a function\nof probe beam position. Experimentally obtained spatial profiles of the\nfluorescence intensity agreed qualitatively with the predictions of the model.\n", "  The axial form factor plays a crucial role in quasielastic neutrino-nucleus\nscattering, but the error of the theoretical cross section due to uncertainties\nof $G_A$ remains to be established. Reversely, the extraction of $G_A$ from the\nneutrino nucleus cross section suffers from large systematic errors due to\nnuclear model dependencies, while the use of single parameter dipole fits\nunderestimates the errors and prevents an identification of the relevant\nkinematics for this determination. We propose to use a generalized\naxial-vector-meson-dominance (AVMD) in conjunction with large-$N_c$ and high\nenergy QCD constrains to model the nucleon axial form factor, as well as the\nhalf width rule as an a priori uncertainty estimate. The minimal hadronic\nansatz comprises the sum of two monopoles corresponding to the lightest\naxial-vector mesons being coupled to the axial current. The parameters of the\nresulting axial form factor are the masses and widths of the two axial mesons\nas obtained from the averaged PDG values. By applying the half width rule in a\nMonte Carlo simulation, a distribution of theoretical predictions can then be\ngenerated for the neutrino-nucleus quasielastic cross section. We test the\nmodel by applying it to the $(\\nu_\\mu,\\mu)$ quasielastic cross section from\n$^{12}$C for the kinematics of the MiniBooNE experiment. The resulting\npredictions have no free parameters. We find that the relativistic Fermi gas\nmodel globally reproduces the experimental data, giving $\\chi^2/ \\# bins =\n0.81$. A $Q^2$-dependent error analysis of the neutrino data shows that the\nuncertainties in the axial form factor $G_A(Q^2)$ are comparable to the ones\ninduced by the a priori half width rule. We identify the most sensitive region\nto be in the range $0.2 \\lesssim Q^2 \\lesssim 0.6 \\,{\\rm GeV}^2$.\n", "  In the last few years, several criteria to identify Eistein-Podolski-Rosen\nsteering have been proposed and experimentally implemented. On the operational\nside, however, the evaluation of the steerability degree of a given state has\nshown to be a difficult task and only a few results are known. In this work, we\npropose a measure of steering that is based on the maximal violation of well\nestablished steering inequalities. Applying this approach to two-qubit states,\nwe managed to derive simple closed formulas for steering in the two- and\nthree-measurement scenarios. Among the options investigated, a measure has been\nfound that correctly satisfies the entanglement-steering-nonlocality hierarchy\nand reproduces results reported so far.\n", "  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), scheduled for launch in 2018, is the\nsuccessor to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) but with a significantly larger\naperture (6.5 m) and advanced instrumentation focusing on infrared science\n(0.6-28.0 $\\mu$m ). In this paper we examine the potential for scientific\ninvestigation of Titan using JWST, primarily with three of the four\ninstruments: NIRSpec, NIRCam and MIRI, noting that science with NIRISS will be\ncomplementary. Five core scientific themes are identified: (i) surface (ii)\ntropospheric clouds (iii) tropospheric gases (iv) stratospheric composition and\n(v) stratospheric hazes. We discuss each theme in depth, including the\nscientific purpose, capabilities and limitations of the instrument suite, and\nsuggested observing schemes. We pay particular attention to saturation, which\nis a problem for all three instruments, but may be alleviated for NIRCam\nthrough use of selecting small sub-arrays of the detectors - sufficient to\nencompass Titan, but with significantly faster read-out times. We find that\nJWST has very significant potential for advancing Titan science, with a\nspectral resolution exceeding the Cassini instrument suite at near-infrared\nwavelengths, and a spatial resolution exceeding HST at the same wavelengths. In\nparticular, JWST will be valuable for time-domain monitoring of Titan, given a\nfive to ten year expected lifetime for the observatory, for example monitoring\nthe seasonal appearance of clouds. JWST observations in the post-Cassini period\nwill complement those of other large facilities such as HST, ALMA, SOFIA and\nnext-generation ground-based telescopes (TMT, GMT, EELT).\n", "  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provides the opportunity for\nground-breaking observations of asteroids. It covers wavelength regions that\nare unavailable from the ground, and does so with unprecedented sensitivity.\nThe main-belt and Trojan asteroids are all observable at some point in the JWST\nlifetime. We present an overview of the capabilities for JWST and how they\napply to the asteroids as well as some short science cases that take advantage\nof these capabilities.\n", "  A Weyl semimetal is a new state of matter that host Weyl fermions as\nquasiparticle excitations. The Weyl fermions at zero energy correspond to\npoints of bulk band degeneracy, Weyl nodes, which are separated in momentum\nspace and are connected only through the crystal's boundary by an exotic Fermi\narc surface state. We experimentally measure the spin polarization of the Fermi\narcs in the first experimentally discovered Weyl semimetal TaAs. Our spin data,\nfor the first time, reveal that the Fermi arcs' spin polarization magnitude is\nas large as 80% and possesses a spin texture that is completely in-plane.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that the chirality of the Weyl nodes in TaAs cannot be\ninferred by the spin texture of the Fermi arcs. The observed non-degenerate\nproperty of the Fermi arcs is important for the establishment of its exact\ntopological nature, which reveal that spins on the arc form a novel type of 2D\nmatter. Additionally, the nearly full spin polarization we observed (~80%) may\nbe useful in spintronic applications.\n", "  The study of supernova remnants (SNRs) is fundamental to understanding the\nchemical enrichment and magnetism in galaxies, including our own Milky Way. In\nan effort to understand the connection between the morphology of SNRs and the\nGalactic magnetic field (GMF), we have examined the radio images of all known\nSNRs in our Galaxy and compiled a large sample that have an \"axisymmetric\"\nmorphology, which we define to mean SNRs with a \"bilateral\" or \"barrel\"-shaped\nmorphology, in addition to one-sided shells. We selected the cleanest examples\nand model each of these at their appropriate Galactic position using two GMF\nmodels, those of Jansson & Farrar (2012a), which includes a vertical halo\ncomponent, and Sun et al. (2008) that is oriented entirely parallel to the\nplane. Since the magnitude and relative orientation of the magnetic field\nchanges with distance from the sun, we analyse a range of distances, from 0.5\nto 10 kpc in each case. Using a physically motivated model of a SNR expanding\ninto the ambient GMF, we find the models using Jansson & Farrar (2012a) are\nable to reproduce observed morphologies of many SNRs in our sample. These\nresults strongly support the presence of an off-plane, vertical component to\nthe GMF, and the importance of the Galactic field on SNR morphology. Our\napproach also provides a potential new method for determining distances to\nSNRs, or conversely, distances to features in the large-scale GMF if SNR\ndistances are known.\n", "  We perform a systematic study of the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on\nthe Husimi lattice using numerical tensor-network methods based on Projected\nEntangled Simplex States (PESS). The nature of the ground state varies strongly\nwith the spin quantum number, $S$. For $S = 1/2$, it is an algebraic (gapless)\nquantum spin liquid. For $S = 1$, it is a gapped, non-magnetic state with\nspontaneous breaking of triangle symmetry (a trimerized simplex-solid state).\nFor $S = 2$, it is a simplex-solid state with a spin gap and no\nsymmetry-breaking; both integer-spin simplex-solid states are characterized by\nspecific degeneracies in the entanglement spectrum. For $S = 3/2$, and indeed\nfor all spin values $S \\ge 5/2$, the ground states have $120$-degree\nantiferromagnetic order. In a finite magnetic field, we find that, irrespective\nof the value of $S$, there is always a plateau in the magnetization at $m =\n1/3$.\n", "  This work focuses on the newly discovered bifurcation phase transition of CDT\nquantum gravity. We define various order parameters and investigate which is\nmost suitable to study this transition in numerical simulations. By analyzing\nthe behaviour of the order parameters we present evidence that the transition\nseparating the bifurcation phase and the physical phase of CDT is likely a\nsecond or higher-order transition, a result that may have important\nimplications for the continuum limit of CDT.\n", "  Two particularly simple ideal clocks exhibiting intrinsic circular motion\nwith the speed of light and opposite spin alignment are described. The clocks\nare singled out by singularities of an inverse Legendre transformation for\nrelativistic rotators of which mass and spin are fixed parameters. Such clocks\nwork always the same way, no matter how they move. When subject to high\naccelerations or falling in strong gravitational fields of black holes, the\nclocks could be used to test the clock hypothesis.\n", "  Boulders are ubiquitously found on the surfaces of small rocky bodies in the\ninner solar system and their spatial and size distributions give insight into\nthe geological evolution and collisional history of the parent bodies. Using\nimages acquired by the Chang'e-2 spacecraft, more than 200 boulders have been\nidentified over the imaged area of the near-Earth asteroid Toutatis. The\ncumulative boulder size frequency distribution (SFD) shows a steep slope of\n-4.4 $\\pm$ 0.1, which is indicative of a high degree of fragmentation. Similar\nto Itokawa, Toutatis probably has a rubble-pile structure, as most boulders on\nits surface cannot solely be explained by impact cratering. The significantly\nsteeper slope for Toutatis' boulder SFD compared to Itokawa may imply a\ndifferent preservation state or diverse formation scenarios. In addition, the\ncumulative crater SFD has been used to estimate a surface crater retention age\nof approximately 1.6 $\\pm$ 0.3 Gyr.\n", "  We present near-infrared (NIR) $H+K$-band longslit spectra of eleven galaxies\nwhich are obtained with SOFI at the NTT (ESO). The galaxies are chosen from the\nlow-luminosity type-1 quasi-stellar object (LLQSO) sample which comprises the\n99 closest ($z\\leq 0.06$) QSOs from the Hamburg/ESO survey for bright UV-excess\nQSOs. These objects are ideal targets to study the gap between local Seyfert\ngalaxies and high-redshift quasars, since they show much stronger AGN activity\ncompared to local objects but are still close enough for a detailed structural\nanalysis.\n  We fit hydrogen recombination, molecular hydrogen, and [FeII] lines after\ncarefully subtracting the continuum emission. From the broad Pa$\\alpha$\ncomponents, we estimate black hole masses and enlarge the sample of LLQSOs that\nshow a deviation from the $M_\\mathrm{BH}-L_\\mathrm{bulge}$ relations of\ninactive galaxies from 12 to 16 objects.\n  All objects show emission from hot dust ($T\\sim 1200\\,\\mathrm{K}$) as well as\nstellar contribution. However, the particular fractions vary a lot between the\nobjects. More than half of the objects show H$_2$ emission lines that are\nindicating a large reservoir of molecular gas which is needed to feed the AGN\nand star formation.\n  In the NIR diagnostic diagram all objects lie in the location of AGN\ndominated objects. However, most of the objects show indications of star\nformation activity, suggesting that their offset location with respect to\n$M_\\mathrm{BH}-L_\\mathrm{bulge}$ relations of inactive galaxies may be a\nconsequence of overluminous bulges.\n", "  Topological phases in two dimensions support anyonic quasiparticle\nexcitations that obey neither bosonic nor fermionic statistics. These anyon\nstructures often carry global symmetries that relate distinct anyons with\nsimilar fusion and statistical properties. Anyonic symmetries associate\ntopological defects or fluxes in topological phases. As the symmetries are\nglobal and static, these extrinsic defects are semiclassical objects that\nbehave disparately from conventional quantum anyons. Remarkably, even when the\ntopological states supporting them are Abelian, they are generically\nnon-Abelian and powerful enough for topological quantum computation. In this\narticle, I review the most recent theoretical developments on symmetries and\ndefects in topological phases.\n", "  The universal bimodal distribution of transmission eigenvalues in lossless\ndiffusive systems un- derpins such celebrated phenomena as universal\nconductance fluctuations, quantum shot noise in condensed matter physics and\nenhanced transmission in optics and acoustics. Here, we show that in the\npresence of absorption, density of the transmission eigenvalues depends on the\nconfinement geometry of scattering media. Furthermore, in an asymmetric\nwaveguide, densities of the reflection and absorption eigenvalues also depend\nof the side from which the waves are incident. With increas- ing absorpotion,\nthe density of absorption eigenvalues transforms from single-peak to\ndouble-peak function. Our findings open a new avenue for coherent control of\nwave transmission, reflection and absorption in random media.\n", "  We calculate the energy spectrum of quasiparticles trapped by a domain wall\nseparating different time reversal symmetry-breaking ground states in a\nhexagonal superconductor, such as UPt$_3$. The bound state energy is found to\nbe strongly dependent on the gap symmetry, the domain wall orientation, the\nquasiparticle's direction of semiclassical propagation, and the phase\ndifference between the domains. We calculate the corresponding density of\nstates and show how one can use its prominent features, in particular, the\nzero-energy singularity, to distinguish between different pairing symmetries.\n", "  Recently an alternative way to quantify Bell nonlocality has been proposed\n[Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 92}, 030101(R) (2015)]. In this work we further develop this\nconcept, the volume of violation, and analytically calculate its value for the\nspin-singlet state with respect to the settings of the first Bell's inequality.\nThese settings correspond to three directions in space, or three arbitrary\npoints on the unit sphere. It is shown that the triples of directions that lead\nto violations in local causality correspond to $1/3$ of all possible\nconfigurations. From the perspective of quantum communications, this means that\ntwo distant parties that were capable of align their measurements in one\ndirection only (the remaining direction in each site being random), have a\nprobability of about 33.3$\\%$ to be able to certify their entanglement.\n", "  We study the migration of three-planet systems in an irradiated 1+1D\n$\\alpha$-disc with photoevaporation. We performed $2700$ simulations with\nvarious planets' masses and initial orbits. We found that most of the systems\nwhich ended up as compact configurations form chains of mean motion resonances\n(MMRs) of the first and higher orders. Most of the systems involved in chains\nof MMRs are periodic configurations. The period ratios of such system, though,\nare not necessarily close to exact commensurability. If a given system resides\nin a divergent migration zone in the disc, the period ratios increase and\nevolve along resonant divergent migration paths at ($P_2/P_1,\nP_3/P_2)$-diagram, where $P_1, P_2, P_3$ are the orbital periods of the first,\nsecond and third planet, respectively. The observed systems, though, do not lie\non those paths. We show that an agreement between the synthetic and the\nobserved systems distributions could be achieved if the orbital circularization\nwas slower than it results from models of the planet-disc interactions.\nTherefore, we conclude that most of those systems unlikely formed as a result\nof divergent migration out of nominal chains of MMRs.\n", "  We present a reverberation mapping (RM) experiment that combines broad- and\nintermediate-band photometry; it is the first such attempt targeting a sample\nof 13 quasars at $0.2<z<0.9$. The quasars were selected to have strong\nH$\\alpha$ or H$\\beta$ emission lines that are located in one of three\nintermediate bands (with FWHM around 200 \\AA) centered at 8045, 8505, and 9171\n\\AA. The imaging observations were carried out in the intermediate bands and\nthe broad $i$ and $z$ bands using the prime-focus imager 90Prime on the 2.3m\nBok telescope. Because of the large ($\\sim$1 deg$^2$) field-of-view (FoV) of\n90Prime, we were able to include the 13 quasars within only five telescope\npointings or fields. The five fields were repeatedly observed over 20--30\nepochs that were unevenly distributed over a duration of 5--6 months. The\ncombination of the broad- and intermediate-band photometry allows us to derive\naccurate light curves for both optical continuum (from the accretion disk) and\nline (from the broad-line region, or BLR) emission. We detect H$\\alpha$ time\nlags between the continuum and line emission in 6 quasars. These quasars are at\na relatively low redshift range $0.2<z<0.4$. The measured lags are consistent\nwith the current BLR size-luminosity relation for H$\\beta$ at $z<0.3$. While\nthis experiment appears successful in detecting lags of the bright H$\\alpha$\nline, further investigation is required to see if it can also be applied to the\nfainter H$\\beta$ line for quasars at higher redshifts. Finally we demonstrate\nthat by using a small telescope with a large FoV, intermediate-band photometric\nRM can be efficiently executed for a large sample of quasars at $z>0.2$.\n", "  We consider turbulent synchrotron emitting media that also exhibits Faraday\nrotation and provide a statistical description of synchrotron polarization\nfluctuations. In particular, we consider these fluctuations as a function of\nthe spatial separation of the direction of measurements and as a function of\nwavelength for the same line-of-sight. On the basis of our general analytical\napproach, we introduce several measures that can be used to obtain the spectral\nslopes and correlation scales of both the underlying magnetic turbulence\nresponsible for emission and the spectrum of the Faraday rotation fluctuations.\nWe show the synergetic nature of these measures and discuss how the study can\nbe performed using sparsely sampled interferometric data. We also discuss how\nadditional characteristics of turbulence can be obtained, including the\nturbulence anisotropy, the three dimensional direction of the mean magnetic\nfield. We consider both cases when the synchrotron emission and Faraday\nrotation regions coincide and when they are spatially separated. Appealing to\nour earlier study in Lazarian and Pogosyan (2012) we explain that our new\nresults are applicable to a wide range of spectral indexes of relativistic\nelectrons responsible for synchrotron emission. We expect wide application of\nour techniques both with existing synchrotron data sets as well as with big\nforthcoming data sets from LOFAR and SKA.\n", "  Based on the standard Skyrme energy density functionals together with the\nextended Thomas-Fermi approach, the properties of symmetric and asymmetric\nnuclear matter represented in two macroscopic-microscopic mass formulas:\nLublin-Strasbourg nuclear drop energy (LSD) formula and Weizs\\\"acker-Skyrme\n(WS*) formula, are extracted through matching the energy per particle of finite\nnuclei. For LSD and WS*, the obtained incompressibility coefficients of\nsymmetric nuclear matter are $K_\\infty=230 \\pm 11$ MeV and $235\\pm 11$ MeV,\nrespectively. The slope parameter of symmetry energy at saturation density is\n$L=41.6\\pm 7.6$ MeV for LSD and $51.5\\pm 9.6$ MeV for WS*, respectively, which\nis compatible with the liquid-drop analysis of Lattimer and Lim [ApJ.\n\\textbf{771}, 51 (2013)]. The density dependence of the mean-field isoscalar\nand isovector effective mass, and the neutron-proton effective masses splitting\nfor neutron matter are simultaneously investigated. The results are generally\nconsistent with those from the Skyrme Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations and\nnucleon optical potentials, and the standard deviations are large and increase\nrapidly with density. A better constraint for the effective mass is helpful to\nreduce uncertainties of the depth of the mean-field potential.\n", "  Motivated by the famous Waddington's epigenetic landscape metaphor in\ndevelopmental biology, biophysicists and applied mathematicians made different\nproposals to realize this metaphor in a rationalized way. We adopt\ncomprehensive perspectives to systematically investigate three different but\nclosely related realizations in recent literature: namely the potential\nlandscape theory from the steady state distribution of stochastic differential\nequations (SDEs), the quasi-potential from the large deviation theory, and the\nconstruction through SDE decomposition and A-type integral.The connections\namong these theories are established in this paper. We demonstrate that the\nquasi-potential is the zero noise limit of the potential landscape. We also\nshow that the potential function in the third proposal coincides with the\nquasi-potential. The most probable transition path by minimizing the\nOnsager-Machlup or Freidlin-Wentzell action functional is discussed as well.\nFurthermore, we compare the difference between local and global quasi-potential\nthrough the exchange of limit order for time and noise amplitude. As a\nconsequence of such explorations, we arrive at the existence result for the SDE\ndecomposition while deny its uniqueness in general cases. It is also clarified\nthat the A-type integral is more appropriate to be applied to the decomposed\nSDEs rather than the original one. Our results contribute to a better\nunderstanding of existing landscape theories for biological systems.\n", "  On 13 December 2012, Chang'e-2 completed a successful flyby of the near-Earth\nasteroid 4179 Toutatis at a closest distance of 770 meters from the asteroid's\nsurface. The observations show that Toutatis has an irregular surface and its\nshape resembles a ginger-root of a smaller lobe (head) and a larger lobe\n(body). Such bilobate shape is indicative of a contact binary origin for\nToutatis. In addition, the high-resolution images better than 3 meters provide\na number of new discoveries about this asteroid, such as an 800-meter\ndepression at the end of the large lobe, a sharply perpendicular silhouette\nnear the neck region, boulders, indicating that Toutatis is probably a\nrubble-pile asteroid. Chang'e-2 observations have significantly revealed new\ninsights into the geological features and the formation and evolution of this\nasteroid. In final, we brief the future Chinese asteroid mission concept.\n", "  Recently suggested transformation optics-based magnifying Maxwell fisheye\nlenses, which are made of two half-lenses of different radii, has been\nfabricated and characterized. The lens action is based on control of\npolarization-dependent effective refractive index in a lithographically formed\ntapered waveguide. We have studied wavelength and polarization dependent\nperformance of the lenses.\n", "  We study dynamical structure of Pure Lovelock gravity in spacetime dimensions\nhigher than four using the Hamiltonian formalism. The action consists of\ncosmological constant and a single higher-order polynomial in the Riemann\ntensor. Similarly to Einstein-Hilbert action, it possesses a unique constant\ncurvature vacuum and charged black hole solutions. We analyze physical degrees\nof freedom and local symmetries in this theory. In contrast to the\nEinstein-Hilbert case, a number of degrees of freedom depends on the background\nand can vary from zero to the maximal value carried by the Lovelock theory.\n", "  $\\mathbb{Z}_d$ Parafermions are exotic non-Abelian quasiparticles\ngeneralizing Majorana fermions, which correspond to the case $d=2$. In contrast\nto Majorana fermions, braiding of parafermions with $d>2$ allows to perform an\nentangling gate. This has spurred interest in parafermions and a variety of\ncondensed matter systems have been proposed as potential hosts for them. In\nthis work, we study the computational power of braiding parafermions more\nsystematically. We make no assumptions on the underlying physical model but\nderive all our results from the algebraical relations that define parafermions.\nWe find a familiy of $2d$ representations of the braid group that are\ncompatible with these relations. The braiding operators derived this way\nreproduce those derived previously from physical grounds as special cases. We\nshow that if a $d$-level qudit is encoded in the fusion space of four\nparafermions, braiding of these four parafermions allows to generate the entire\nsingle-qudit Clifford group (up to phases), for any $d$. If $d$ is odd, then we\nshow that in fact the entire many-qudit Clifford group can be generated.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the thermophysical properties, including thermal\ninertia, roughness fraction and surface grain size of OSIRIS-REx target\nasteroid (101955) Bennu by using a thermophysical model with the recently\nupdated 3D radar-derived shape model (\\cite[Nolan et al., 2013]{Nolan2013}) and\nmid-infrared observations (\\cite[M$\\ddot{u}$ller et al, 2012]{Muller2012},\n\\cite[Emery et al., 2014]{Emery2014}). We find that the asteroid bears an\neffective diameter of $510^{+6}_{-40}$ m, a geometric albedo of\n$0.047^{+0.0083}_{-0.0011}$, a roughness fraction of $0.04^{+0.26}_{-0.04}$,\nand thermal inertia of $240^{+440}_{-60}\\rm~Jm^{-2}s^{-0.5}K^{-1}$ for our\nbest-fit solution. The best-estimate thermal inertia suggests that fine-grained\nregolith may cover a large portion of Bennu's surface, where a grain size may\nvary from $1.3$ to $31$~mm. Our outcome suggests that Bennu is suitable for the\nOSIRIS-REx mission to return samples to Earth.\n", "  A generalized version of the coupled coherent states method for coherent\nstates of arbitrary Lie groups is developed. In contrast to the original\nformulation, which is restricted to frozen-Gaussian basis sets, the extended\nmethod is suitable for propagating quantum states of systems featuring\ndiversified physical properties, such as spin degrees of freedom or particle\nindistinguishability. The approach is illustrated with simple models for\ninteracting bosons trapped in double- and triple-well potentials, most\nadequately described in terms of SU(2) and SU(3) bosonic coherent states,\nrespectively.\n", "  In inflationary cosmology, cosmic reheating after inflation sets the initial\nconditions for the hot big bang. We investigate how CMB data can be used to\nstudy the effective potential and couplings of the inflaton during reheating\nand constrain the underlying microphysics. If there is a phase of preheating\nthat is driven by a parametric resonance or other instability, then the thermal\nhistory and expansion history during the reheating era depend on a large number\nof microphysical parameters in a complicated way. In this case the connection\nbetween CMB observables and microphysical parameters can only established with\nintense numerical studies. Such studies can help to improve CMB constraints on\nthe effective inflaton potential in specific models, but parameter degeneracies\nusually make it impossible to extract meaningful best-fit values for individual\nmicrophysical parameters. If, on the other hand, reheating is driven by\nperturbative processes, then it can be possible to constrain the inflaton\ncouplings and the reheating temperature from CMB data. This provides an\nindirect probe of fundamental microphysical parameters that most likely can\nnever be measured directly in the laboratory, but have an immense impact on the\nevolution of the cosmos by setting the stage for the hot big bang.\n", "  Intrinsic fluctuations of the proton saturation momentum generate asymmetric\nrapidity distributions on an event-by-event basis. We argue that the asymmetric\ncomponent, $\\left<a_1^2\\right>$, of the orthogonal polynomial decomposition of\nthe two-particle rapidity correlation function is a sensitive probe to this\ndistribution of fluctuations. We present a simple model connecting the\nexperimentally measured $\\left<a_1^2\\right>$ to the variance, $\\sigma$, of the\ndistribution of the logarithm of the proton saturation scale. We find that\n$\\sigma\\approx 0. 5-1$ describes the asymmetric component of the rapidity\ncorrelations recently measured by the ATLAS collaboration.\n", "  In the alignment limit of a multi-doublet Higgs sector, one of the Higgs mass\neigenstates aligns in field space with the direction of the scalar field vacuum\nexpectation values, and its couplings approach those of the Standard Model (SM)\nHiggs boson. We consider CP-conserving Two-Higgs-Doublet Models (2HDMs) of Type\nI and Type II near the alignment limit in which the heavier of the two CP-even\nHiggs bosons, $H$, is the SM-like state observed with a mass of 125 GeV, and\nthe couplings of $H$ to gauge bosons approach those of the SM. We review the\ntheoretical structure and analyze the phenomenological implications of this\nparticular realization of the alignment limit, where decoupling of the extra\nstates cannot occur given that the lighter CP-even state $h$ must, by\ndefinition, have a mass below 125 GeV. For the numerical analysis, we perform\nscans of the 2HDM parameter space employing the software packages 2HDMC and\nLilith, taking into account all relevant pre-LHC constraints, constraints from\nthe measurements of the 125 GeV Higgs signal at the LHC, as well as the most\nrecent limits coming from searches for heavy Higgs-like states. Implications\nfor Run 2 at the LHC, including expectations for observing the other scalar\nstates, are also discussed.\n", "  The next fundamental steps forward in understanding our place in the universe\ncould be a result of advances in extreme contrast ratio (ECR) imaging and point\nspread function (PSF) suppression. For example, blinded by quasar light we have\nyet to fully understand the processes of galaxy formation and evolution, and\nthere is an ongoing race to obtain a direct image of an exoearth lost in the\nglare of its host star. To fully explore the features of these systems we must\nperform observations in which contrast ratios of at least one billion can be\nregularly achieved with sub 0.1\" inner working angles. Here we present the\ndetails of a latest generation 32-bit charge injection device (CID) that could\nconceivably achieve contrast ratios on the order of one billion. We also\ndemonstrate some of its ECR imaging abilities for astronomical imaging. At a\nseparation of two arc minutes, we report a direct contrast ratio of\nDelta(m_v)=18.3, log(CR)=7.3, or 1 part in 20 million, from observations of the\nSirius field. The atmospheric conditions present during the collection of this\ndata prevented less modest results, and we expect to be able to achieve higher\ncontrast ratios, with improved inner working angles, simply by operating a CID\nat a world-class observing site. However, CIDs do not directly provide any PSF\nsuppression. Therefore, combining CID imaging with a simple PSF suppression\ntechnique like angular differential imaging, could provide a cheap and easy\nalternative to the complex ECR techniques currently being employed.\n", "  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will allow observations with a unique\ncombination of spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution for the study of\nouter planet satellites within our Solar System. We highlight the infrared\nspectroscopy of icy moons and temporal changes on geologically active\nsatellites as two particularly valuable avenues of scientific inquiry. While\nsome care must be taken to avoid saturation issues, JWST has observation modes\nthat should provide excellent infrared data for such studies.\n", "  We study the stability of persistent currents in a coherently coupled\nquasi-2D Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a ring trap at T=0. By\nnumerically solving Gross-Pitaevskii equations and by analyzing the excitation\nspectrum obtained from diagonalization of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes matrix, we\ndescribe the mechanisms responsible for the decay of the persistent currents\ndepending on the values of the interaction coupling constants and the Rabi\nfrequency. When the unpolarized system decays due to an energetic instability\nin the density channel, the spectrum may develop a roton-like minimum, which\ngives rise to the finite wavelength excitation necessary for vortex nucleation\nat the inner surface. When decay in the unpolarized system is driven by\nspin-density excitations, the finite wavelength naturally arises from the\nexistence of a gap in the excitation spectrum. In the polarized phase of the\ncoherently coupled condensate, there is an hybridization of the excitation\nmodes that leads to complex decay dynamics. In particular, close to the phase\ntransition, a state of broken rotational symmetry is found to be stationary and\nstable.\n", "  Direct evidence of the $\\alpha$-cluster manifestation in bound states has not\nbeen obtained yet, although a number of experimental studies were carried out\nto extract the information of the clustering. In particular in conventional\nanalyses of $\\alpha$-transfer reactions, there exist a few significant problems\non reaction models, which are insufficient to qualitatively discuss the cluster\nstructure. We aim to verify the development of the $\\alpha$-cluster structure\nfrom observables. As the first application, we plan to extract the spatial\ninformation of the cluster structure of the $^{20}$Ne nucleus in its ground\nstate through the cross section of the $\\alpha$-transfer reaction\n$^{16}$O($^6$Li,~$d$)$^{20}$Ne. For the analysis of the transfer reaction, we\nwork with the coupled-channel Born approximation (CCBA) approach, in which the\nbreakup effect of $^6$Li is explicitly taken into account by means of the\ncontinuum-discretized coupled-channel method based on the three-body $\\alpha +\nd + {}^{16}$O model. The two methods are adopted to calculate the overlap\nfunction between $^{20}$Ne and $\\alpha + {}^{16}$O; one is the microscopic\ncluster model (MCM) with the generator coordinate method, and the other is the\nphenomenological two-body potential model (PM). We show that the CCBA\ncalculation with the MCM wave function gives a significant improvement of the\ntheoretical result on the angular distribution of the transfer cross section,\nwhich is consistent with the experimental data. Employing the PM, it is\ndiscussed which region of the cluster wave function is probed on the transfer\ncross section. It is found that the surface region of the cluster wave function\nis sensitive to the cross section. The present work is situated as the first\nstep in obtaining important information to systematically investigate the\ncluster structure.\n", "  Simple growth mechanisms have been proposed to explain the emergence of\nseemingly universal network structures. The widely-studied model of\npreferential attachment assumes that new nodes are more likely to connect to\nhighly connected nodes. Preferential attachment explains the emergence of\nscale-free degree distributions within complex networks. Yet, it is\nincompatible with many network systems, particularly bipartite systems in which\ntwo distinct types of agents interact. For example, the addition of new links\nin a host-parasite system corresponds to the infection of hosts by parasites.\nIncreasing connectivity is beneficial to a parasite and detrimental to a host.\nTherefore, the overall network connectivity is subject to conflicting\npressures. Here, we propose a stochastic network growth model of conflicting\nattachment, inspired by a particular kind of parasite-host interactions: that\nof viruses interacting with microbial hosts. The mechanism of network growth\nincludes conflicting preferences to network density as well as costs involved\nin modifying the network connectivity according to these preferences. We find\nthat the resulting networks exhibit realistic patterns commonly observed in\nempirical data, including the emergence of nestedness, modularity, and\nnested-modular structures that exhibit both properties. We study the role of\nconflicting interests in shaping network structure and assess opportunities to\nincorporate greater realism in linking growth process to pattern in systems\ngoverned by antagonistic and mutualistic interactions.\n", "  The one-dimensional totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP), a\nMarkov process describing classical hard-core particles hopping in the same\ndirection, is considered on a periodic lattice of $L$ sites. The relaxation to\nthe non-equilibrium steady state, which occurs on the time scale $t\\sim\nL^{3/2}$ for large $L$, is studied for the half-filled system with $N=L/2$\nparticles. Using large $L$ asymptotics of Bethe ansatz formulas for the\neigenstates, exact expressions depending explicitly on the rescaled time\n$t/L^{3/2}$ are obtained for the average and two-point function of the local\ndensity, and for the current fluctuations for simple (stationary, flat and\nstep) initial conditions, relating previous results for the infinite system to\nstationary large deviations. The final formulas have a nice interpretation in\nterms of a functional integral with the action of a scalar field in a linear\npotential.\n", "  This paper presents analysis of the rotational parameters of Toutatis based\non the observational results from Chang'e-2's close flyby. The 3-D shape model\nderived from ground-based radar observation is used to calculate the 3-1-3\nEuler angles at the flyby epoch, which are evaluated to be\n$-20.1^\\circ\\pm1^\\circ$, $27.6^\\circ\\pm1^\\circ$ and $42.2^\\circ\\pm1^\\circ$. The\nlarge amplitude of Toutatis' tumbling attitude is demonstrated to be the result\nof the large deviation of the angular momentum axis and the rotational axis.\nTwo rotational periods are evaluated to be $5.38\\pm0.03$ days for rotation\nabout the long axis and $7.40\\pm0.03$ days for precession of the long axis\nabout the angular momentum vector based on Fourier analysis. These results\nprovide a further understanding of rotational state of Toutatis.\n", "  We re-process the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA)\nlong-baseline science verification data taken toward HL Tauri. As shown by the\nprevious work, we confirm that the high spatial resolution (~ 0.\"019,\ncorresponding to ~ 2.7 AU) dust continuum images at \\lambda = 0.87, 1.3, and\n2.9 mm exhibit a multiple ring-like gap structure in the circumstellar disk.\nAssuming that the observed gaps are opened up by currently forming, unseen\nbodies, we estimate the mass of such hypothetical bodies based on following two\napproaches; the Hill radius analysis and a more elaborated approach developed\nfrom the angular momentum transfer analysis in gas disks. For the former, the\nmeasured gap widths are used for calibrating the mass of the bodies, while for\nthe latter, the measured gap depths are utilized. We show that their masses are\nlikely comparable to or less than the mass of Jovian planets, and then discuss\nan origin of the observed gap structure. By evaluating Toomre's gravitational\ninstability (GI) condition and cooling effect, we find that the GI might be a\npossible mechanism to form the bodies in the outer region of the disk. As the\ndisk might be gravitationally unstable only in the outer region of the disk,\ninward planetary migration would be needed to construct the current\narchitecture of the hypothetical bodies. We estimate the gap-opening mass and\nshow that type II migration might be able to play such a role. Combining GIs\nwith inward migration, we conjecture that all of the observed gaps may be a\nconsequence of bodies that might have originally formed at the outer part of\nthe disk, and have subsequently migrated to the current locations. While ALMA's\nunprecedented high spatial resolution observations can revolutionize our\npicture of planet formation, more dedicated observational and theoretical\nstudies are needed in order to fully understand the HL Tau images.\n", "  We observe the condensation of magnon excitations within an $F=1$ $^{87}$Rb\nspinor Bose-Einstein condensed gas. Magnons are pumped into a longitudinally\nspin-polarized gas, allowed to equilibrate to a non-degenerate distribution,\nand then cooled evaporatively at near-constant net longitudinal magnetization\nwhereupon they condense. We find magnon condensation to be described\nquantitatively as the condensation of free particles in an effective potential\nthat is uniform within the ferromagnetic condensate volume, evidenced by the\nnumber and distribution of magnons at the condensation transition. Transverse\nmagnetization images reveal directly the spontaneous, inhomogeneous symmetry\nbreaking by the magnon quasi-condensate, including signatures of Mermin-Ho spin\ntextures that appear as phase singularities in the magnon condensate\nwavefunction.\n", "  Decade-long timing observations of arrays of millisecond pulsars have placed\nhighly constraining upper limits on the amplitude of the nanohertz\ngravitational-wave stochastic signal from the mergers of supermassive\nblack-hole binaries ($\\sim 10^{-15}$ strain at $f = 1/\\mathrm{yr}$). These\nlimits suggest that binary merger rates have been overestimated, or that\nenvironmental influences from nuclear gas or stars accelerate orbital decay,\nreducing the gravitational-wave signal at the lowest, most sensitive\nfrequencies. This prompts the question whether nanohertz gravitational waves\nare likely to be detected in the near future. In this letter, we answer this\nquestion quantitatively using simple statistical estimates, deriving the range\nof true signal amplitudes that are compatible with current upper limits, and\ncomputing expected detection probabilities as a function of observation time.\nWe conclude that small arrays consisting of the pulsars with the least timing\nnoise, which yield the tightest upper limits, have discouraging prospects of\nmaking a detection in the next two decades. By contrast, we find large arrays\nare crucial to detection because the quadrupolar spatial correlations induced\nby gravitational waves can be well sampled by many pulsar pairs. Indeed, timing\nprograms which monitor a large and expanding set of pulsars have an $\\sim 80\\%$\nprobability of detecting gravitational waves within the next ten years, under\nassumptions on merger rates and environmental influences ranging from\noptimistic to conservative. Even in the extreme case where $90\\%$ of binaries\nstall before merger and environmental coupling effects diminish low-frequency\ngravitational-wave power, detection is delayed by at most a few years.\n", "  All (un)polarized transverse momentum dependent functions (TMDs), both\ndistribution and fragmentation functions, are defined with the same universal\nsoft function, which cancels spurious rapidity divergences within an individual\nTMD and renders them well-defined hadronic quantities. Moreover, it is\nindependent of the kinematics, whether it is Drell-Yan, deep inelastic\nscattering or $e^+e^-\\rightarrow 2$ hadrons. In this paper we provide this soft\nfunction at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO), necessary for the calculation\nof all TMDs at the same order, and to perform the resummation of large\nlogarithms at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy. From the\nresults we obtain the $D$ function at NNLO, which governs the evolution of all\nTMDs. This work represents the first independent and direct calculation of this\nquantity. Given the all order relation through a Casimir scaling between the\nsoft function relevant for gluon TMDs and the one for quark TMDs, we also\nobtain the first at NNLO. The used regularization method to deal with the\nrapidity divergences is discussed as well.\n", "  We report the discovery of a new transiting planet from the WASP survey.\nWASP-135b is a hot Jupiter with a radius of 1.30 pm 0.09 Rjup, a mass of 1.90\npm 0.08 Mjup and an orbital period of 1.401 days. Its host is a Sun-like star,\nwith a G5 spectral type and a mass and radius of 0.98 pm 0.06 Msun and 0.96 pm\n0.05 Rsun respectively. The proximity of the planet to its host means that\nWASP-135b receives high levels of insolation, which may be the cause of its\ninflated radius. Additionally, we find weak evidence of a transfer of angular\nmomentum from the planet to its star.\n", "  We have made a simple and natural modification of a recent quantum\nrefrigerator model presented by Cleuren et al. in Phys. Rev, Lett.108, 120603\n(2012). The original model consist of two metal leads acting as heat baths, and\na set of quantum dots that allow for electron transport between the baths. It\nwas shown to violate the dynamic third law of thermodynamics (the\nunattainability principle, which states that cooling to absolute zero in finite\ntime is impossible), but by taking into consideration the finite energy level\nspacing in metals we restore the third law, while keeping all of the original\nmodel's thermodynamic properties intact.\n", "  Global evolution and dispersal of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) is governed by\ndisk angular momentum transport and mass-loss processes. Recent numerical\nstudies suggest that angular momentum transport in the inner region of PPDs is\nlargely driven by magnetized disk wind, yet the wind mass-loss rate remains\nunconstrained. On the other hand, disk mass loss has conventionally been\nattributed to photoevaporation, where external heating on the disk surface\ndrives a thermal wind. We unify the two scenarios by developing a 1D model of\nmagnetized disk winds with a simple treatment of thermodynamics as a proxy for\nexternal heating. The wind properties largely depend on 1) the magnetic field\nstrength at the wind base, characterized by the poloidal Alfv\\'en speed\n$v_{Ap}$, 2) the sound speed $c_s$ near the wind base, and 3) how rapidly\npoloidal field lines diverge (achieve $R^{-2}$ scaling). When $v_{Ap}\\gg c_s$,\ncorotation is enforced near the wind base, resulting in centrifugal\nacceleration. Otherwise, the wind is accelerated mainly by the pressure of the\ntoroidal magnetic field. In both cases, the dominant role played by magnetic\nforces likely yields wind outflow rates that well exceed purely hydrodynamical\nmechanisms. For typical PPD accretion-rate and wind-launching conditions, we\nexpect $v_{Ap}$ to be comparable to $c_s$ at the wind base. The resulting wind\nis heavily loaded, with total wind mass loss rate likely reaching a\nconsiderable fraction of wind-driven accretion rate. Implications for modeling\nglobal disk evolution and planet formation are also discussed.\n", "  We investigate F-theory on an elliptic Calabi-Yau 4-fold without a section to\nthe fibration. To construct an elliptic Calabi-Yau 4-fold without a section, we\nintroduce families of elliptic K3 surfaces which do not admit a section. A\nproduct K3 $\\times$ K3, with one of the K3's chosen from these families of\nelliptic K3 surfaces without a section, realises an elliptic Calabi-Yau 4-fold\nwithout a section. We then compactify F-theory on such K3 $\\times$ K3's. We\ndetermine the gauge groups and matter fields which arise on 7-branes for these\nmodels of F-theory compactifications without a section. Since each K3 $\\times$\nK3 constructed does not have a section, gauge groups arising on 7-branes for\nF-theory models on constructed K3 $\\times$ K3's do not have $U(1)$-part.\nInterestingly, exceptional gauge group $E_6$ appears for some cases.\n", "  We discuss a way to exploit the conformal mapping to study the response of a\nfinite metallic element of arbitrary shape to an external electromagnetic field\nat finite frequencies. This provides a simple way to study different physics\nissues and provides new insights that include the issue of vorticity and eddy\ncurrent, and the nature of the divergent electric field at the boundaries and\nat corners. The nature of the resonance can be directly addressed and\nclarified. We study an example of an equilateral triangle and found good\nagreement with results obtained with traditional numerical techniques.\n", "  The Mercedes diagram has four trivalent vertices which are connected by six\nlinks such that they form the edges of a tetrahedron. This three loop Feynman\ndiagram contributes to the D^{12} R^4 amplitude at genus one in type II string\ntheory, where the vertices are the points of insertion of the graviton vertex\noperators, and the links are the scalar propagators on the toroidal worldsheet.\nWe obtain a modular invariant Poisson equation satisfied by the Mercedes\ndiagram, where the source terms involve one and two loop Feynman diagrams. We\ncalculate its contribution to the D^{12} R^4 amplitude.\n", "  Optical lattices with a complex-valued tunnelling term have become a standard\nway of studying gauge-field physics with cold atoms. If the complex phase of\nthe tunnelling is made density-dependent, such system features even a\nself-interacting or dynamical magnetic field. In this paper we study the\nscenario of a few bosons in either a static or a dynamical gauge field by means\nof exact diagonalization. The topological structures are identified computing\ntheir Chern number. Upon decreasing the atom-atom contact interaction, the\neffect of the dynamical gauge field is enhanced, giving rise to a phase\ntransition between two topologically non-trivial phases.\n", "  We study transitions of hadronic matter (HM) to 3-flavor quark matter (3QM)\nlocally, regarding the conversion processes as combustion and describing them\nhydrodynamically. Not only the jump condition on both sides of the conversion\nfront but the structures inside the front are also considered by taking into\naccount what happens during the conversion processes on the time scale of weak\ninteractions as well as equations of state (EOS's) in the mixed phase. Under\nthe assumption that HM is metastable with their free energies being larger than\nthose of 3QM but smaller than those of 2-flavor quark matter (2QM), we consider\nthe transition via 2QM triggered by a rapid density rise in a shock wave. Based\non the results, we discuss which combustion modes (strong/weak detonation) may\nbe realized. HM is described by an EOS based on the relativistic mean field\ntheory and 2, 3QM's are approximated by the MIT bag model. We demonstrate for a\nwide range of bag constant and strong coupling constant in this combination of\nEOS's that the combustion may occur in the so-called endothermic regime, in\nwhich the Hugoniot curve for combustion runs below the one for the shock wave\nin P-V plane, and which has no terrestrial counter part. We find that strong\ndetonation always occurs. Depending on the EOS of quark matter (QM) as well as\nthe density of HM and the Mach number of the detonation front, deconfinement\nfrom HM to 2QM is either completed or not completed in the shock wave. In the\nlatter case, which is more likely if the EOS of QM ensures that deconfinement\noccurs above the nuclear saturation density and that the maximum mass of cold\nquark stars is larger than two solar mass, the conversion continues further via\nthe mixing state of HM and 3QM on the time scale of weak interactions.\n", "  We study transitions of hadronic matter (HM) to 3-flavor quark matter (3QM),\nregarding the conversion processes as combustion and describing them\nhydrodynamically. Under the assumption that HM is metastable with their free\nenergies being larger than those of 3QM but smaller than those of 2-flavor\nquark matter (2QM), we consider in this paper the conversion induced by\ndiffusions of seed 3QM. This is a sequel to our previous paper, in which the\nshock-induced conversion was studied in the same frame work. We not only pay\nattention to the jump condition on both sides of the conversion front but the\nstructures inside the front are also considered by taking into account what\nhappens during the conversion processes on the time scale of weak interactions.\nWe employ for HM the Shen's EOS, which is based on the relativistic mean field\ntheory, and the bag model-based EOS for QM just as in the previous paper. We\ndemonstrated in that paper that in this combination of EOS's the combustion\nwill occur for a wide range of the bag constant and strong coupling constant in\nthe so-called endothermic regime, in which the Hugoniot curve for combustion\nruns below the initial state. We find that weak deflagration nearly always\noccurs and that weak detonation is possible only when the diffusion constant is\n(unrealistically) large and the critical strange fraction is small. The\nvelocities of the conversion front are ~ $10^3-10^7$ cm/s depending on the\ninitial temperature and density as well as the parameters in the QM EOS and\nbecome particularly small when the final state is in the mixed phase. Finally\nwe study linear stability of the laminar weak-deflagration front and find that\nit is unstable in the exothermic regime (Darrius-Landau instability) but stable\nin the endothermic regime, which is quite contrary to the ordinary combustions.\n", "  We study the two-body bound and scattering states of two particles in a one\ndimensional optical lattice in the presence of a coherent coupling between two\ninternal atomic levels. Due to the interplay between periodic potential,\ninteractions and coherent coupling, the internal structure of the bound states\ndepends on their center of mass momentum. This phenomenon corresponds to an\neffective momentum-dependent magnetic field for the dimer pseudo-spin, which\ncould be observed in a chirping of the precession frequency during Bloch\noscillations. The essence of this effect can be easily interpreted in terms of\nan effective bound state Hamiltonian. Moreover for indistinguishable bosons,\nthe two-body eigenstates can present simultaneously attractive and repulsive\nbound-state nature or even bound and scattering properties.\n", "  We show that the asymptotic symmetries close to nonextremal black hole\nhorizons are generated by an extension of supertranslations. This group is\ngenerated by a semidirect sum of Virasoro and Abelian currents. The charges\nassociated with the asymptotic Killing symmetries satisfy the same algebra.\nWhen considering the special case of a stationary black hole, the zero mode\ncharges correspond to the angular momentum and the entropy at the horizon.\n", "  We present generic bounds on magnetic fields produced from cosmic inflation.\nBy investigating field bounds on the vector potential, we constrain both the\nquantum mechanical production of magnetic fields and their classical growth in\na model independent way. For classical growth, we show that only if the\nreheating temperature is as low as T_{reh} <~ 10^2 MeV can magnetic fields of\n10^{-15} G be produced on Mpc scales in the present universe. For purely\nquantum mechanical scenarios, even stronger constraints are derived. Our bounds\non classical and quantum mechanical scenarios apply to generic theories of\ninflationary magnetogenesis with a two-derivative time kinetic term for the\nvector potential. In both cases, the magnetic field strength is limited by the\ngravitational back-reaction of the electric fields that are produced\nsimultaneously. As an example of quantum mechanical scenarios, we construct\nvector field theories whose time diffeomorphisms are spontaneously broken, and\nexplore magnetic field generation in theories with a variable speed of light.\nTransitions of quantum vector field fluctuations into classical fluctuations\nare also analyzed in the examples.\n", "  Context. Quasi-periodic variability has been observed in a number of X-ray\nbinaries harboring black hole candidates. In general relativity, black holes\nare uniquely described by the Kerr metric and, according to the cosmic\ncensorship conjecture, curvature singularities always have to be clothed by an\nevent horizon. Aims. In this paper, we study the effect of an external magnetic\nfield on the observed light curves of orbiting hot spots in thin accretion\ndiscs around Kerr black holes and naked singularities. Methods. We employ a\nray-tracing algorithm to calculate the light curves and power spectra of such\nhot spots as seen by a distant observer for uniform and dipolar magnetic field\nconfigurations assuming a weak coupling between the magnetic field and the disc\nmatter. Results. We show that the presence of an external dipolar magnetic\nfield leads to potentially observable modifications of these signals for both\nKerr black holes and naked singularities, while an external uniform magnetic\nfield has practically no effect. In particular, we demonstrate that the\nemission from a hot spot orbiting near the innermost stable circular orbit of a\nnaked singularity in a dipolar magnetic field can be significantly harder than\nthe emission of the same hot spot in the absence of such a magnetic field.\nConclusions. The comparison of our model with observational data may allow us\nstudy the geometry of magnetic fields around compact objects and to test the\ncosmic censorship conjecture in conjunction with other observables such as\nthermal continuum spectra and iron line profiles.\n", "  We study Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg (LZS) interferometry in multilevel systems\ncoupled to an Ohmic quantum bath. We consider the case of superconducting flux\nqubits driven by a dc+ac magnetic fields, but our results can apply to other\nsimilar systems. We find a dynamic transition manifested by a symmetry change\nin the structure of the LZS interference pattern, plotted as a function of ac\namplitude and dc detuning. The dynamic transition is from a LZS pattern with\nnearly symmetric multiphoton resonances to antisymmetric multiphoton resonances\nat long times (above the relaxation time). We also show that the presence of a\nresonant mode in the quantum bath can impede the dynamic transition when the\nresonant frequency is of the order of the qubit gap. Our results are obtained\nby a numerical calculation of the finite time and the asymptotic stationary\npopulation of the qubit states, using the Floquet-Markov approach to solve a\nrealistic model of the flux qubit considering up to 10 energy levels.\n", "  We explore the environmental dependence of star formation timescales in low\nmass galaxies using the [$\\alpha$/Fe] abundance ratio as an evolutionary clock.\nWe present integrated [$\\alpha$/Fe] measurements for 11 low mass ($M_\\star \\sim\n10^9~M_\\odot$) early-type galaxies (ETGs) with a large range of cluster-centric\ndistance in the Virgo Cluster. We find a gradient in [$\\alpha$/Fe], where the\ngalaxies closest to the cluster center (the cD galaxy, M87) have the highest\nvalues. This trend is driven by galaxies within a projected radius of 0.4~Mpc\n(0.26 times the virial radius of Virgo~A), all of which have super-solar\n[$\\alpha$/Fe]. Galaxies in this mass range exhibit a large scatter in the\n[$\\alpha$/Fe]--$\\sigma$ diagram, and do not obviously lie on an extension of\nthe relation defined by massive ETGs. In addition, we find a correlation\nbetween [$\\alpha$/Fe] and globular cluster specific frequency ($S_N$),\nsuggesting that low-mass ETGs that formed their stars over a short period of\ntime, were also efficient at forming massive star clusters. The innermost\nlow-mass ETGs in our sample have [$\\alpha$/Fe] values comparable to that of\nM87, implying that environment is the controlling factor for star formation\ntimescales in dense regions. These low-mass galaxies could be the surviving\ncounterparts of the objects that have already been accreted into the halo of\nM87, and may be the link between present-day low-mass galaxies and the old,\nmetal-poor, high-[$\\alpha$/Fe], high-$S_N$ stellar populations seen in the\nouter halos of massive ETGs.\n", "  Metastasis is a process of cell migration that can be collective and guided\nby chemical cues. Viewing metastasis in this way, as a physical phenomenon,\nallows one to draw upon insights from other studies of collective sensing and\nmigration in cell biology. Here we review recent progress in the study of cell\nsensing and migration as collective phenomena, including in the context of\nmetastatic cells. We describe simple physical models that yield the limits to\nthe precision of cell sensing, and we review experimental evidence that cells\noperate near these limits. Models of collective migration are surveyed in order\nunderstand how collective metastatic invasion can occur. We conclude by\ncontrasting cells' sensory abilities with their sensitivity to drugs, and\nsuggesting potential alternatives to cell-death-based cancer therapies.\n", "  We discuss a model of random segmented wire, with linear segments of 2D wires\njoined by circular bends. The joining vertices act as scatterers on the\npropagating electron waves. The model leads to resonant Anderson localization\nwhen all segments are of similar length. The resonant behavior is present with\none and also with several propagating modes. The probability distributions\nevolve from diffusive to localized regimes when increasing the number of\nsegments in a similar way for long and short localization lengths. As a\nfunction of the energy a finite segmented wire typically evolves from localized\nto diffusive to ballistic behavior in each conductance plateau.\n", "  We study current-current correlation in an electronic analog of a beam\nsplitter realized with edge channels of a fractional quantum Hall liquid at\nLaughlin filling fractions. In analogy with the known result for chiral\nelectrons, if the currents are measured at points located after the beam\nsplitter, we find that the zero frequency equilibrium correlation vanishes due\nto the chiral propagation along the edge channels. Furthermore, we show that\nthe current-current correlation, normalized to the tunneling current, exhibits\nclear signatures of the Laughlin quasi-particles' fractional statistics.\n", "  We have determined the dispersion relation of a neutrino test particle\npropagating in the cosmic neutrino background. Describing the relic neutrinos\nand antineutrinos from the hot big bang as a dense medium, a matter potential\nor refractive index is obtained. The vacuum neutrino mixing angles are\nunchanged, but the energy of each mass state is modified. Using a matrix in the\nspace of neutrino species, the induced potential is decomposed into a part\nwhich produces signatures in beta-decay experiments and another part which\nmodifies neutrino oscillations. The low temperature of the relic neutrinos\nmakes a direct detection extremely challenging. From a different point of view,\nthe identified refractive effects of the cosmic neutrino background constitute\nan ultralow background for future experimental studies of nonvanishing Lorentz\nviolation in the neutrino sector.\n", "  The Fermi gamma-ray space telescope has revolutionized our understanding of\nthe cosmic gamma-ray background radiation in the GeV band. However,\ninvestigation on the cosmic TeV gamma-ray background radiation still remains\nsparse. Here, we report the lower bound on the cosmic TeV gamma-ray background\nspectrum placed by the cumulative flux of individual detected extragalactic TeV\nsources including blazars, radio galaxies, and starburst galaxies. The current\nlimit on the cosmic TeV gamma-ray background above 0.1 TeV is obtained as\n$2.8\\times10^{-8} (E/100~{\\rm GeV})^{-0.55} \\exp(-E/2100~{\\rm GeV})~{\\rm\n[GeV/cm^2/s/sr]} < E^2dN/dE < 1.1\\times10^{-7} (E/100~{\\rm GeV})^{-0.49}~{\\rm\n[GeV/cm^2/s/sr]}$, where the upper bound is set by requirement that the cascade\nflux from the cosmic TeV gamma-ray background radiation can not exceed the\nmeasured cosmic GeV gamma-ray background spectrum (Inoue & Ioka, 2012). Two\nnearby blazars, Mrk 421 and Mrk 501, explain ~70% of the cumulative background\nflux at 0.8-4 TeV, while extreme blazars start to dominate at higher energies.\nWe also provide the cumulative background flux from each population, i.e.\nblazars, radio galaxies, and starburst galaxies which will be the minimum\nrequirement for their contribution to the cosmic TeV gamma-ray background\nradiation.\n", "  While numerical simulations suggest that the strength of the Lyman alpha\n(Lya) line of star-forming disk galaxies strongly depends on the inclination at\nwhich they are observed (i.e. from edge-on to face-on, we expect to see a\nchange from an attenuated Lya line to a strong Lya emission line), recent\nobservations with the Hubble space telescope (HST) have highlighted few\nlow-redshift highly inclined (edge-on) disk galaxies that breaks this trend. We\naim to understand how a strong Lya emission line is able to escape from one of\nthose inclined disk galaxies, named Mrk1486 (z=0.0338). For that purpose we\nused a large set of HST imaging and spectroscopic data to investigate both the\nISM structure and the dominant source of Lya radiation inside Mrk1486.\nMoreover, we used a 3D Monte Carlo Lya radiation transfer code to study the\nradiative transfer of Lya and UV continuum photons inside a 3D geometry of\nneutral hydrogen (HI) and dust that models the ISM structure at the galaxy\ncenter. The analysis of IFU Halpha spectroscopic data of Mrk1486 indicates the\npresence of two bipolar galactic winds of HI gas above and bellow the disk\nplane of Mrk1486. Furthermore, comparing different diagnostic diagrams (such as\n[OIII]5007/Hbeta versus [OI]6300/Halpha) to photo- and shock-ionization models,\nwe find that the Lya production of Mrk1486 is dominated by photoionization\ninside the galaxy disk. From this perspective, our numerical simulations\nsucceed in reproducing the strength and spectral shape of the observed Lya line\nof Mrk1486 by assuming a scenario in which the Lya photons are produced inside\nthe disk, travel along the galactic winds and scatter on cool HI materials\ntoward the observer. As bipolar galactic winds are ubiquitous in star-forming\ndisk galaxies, this mechanism may explain the origin of strong Lya emission\nlines recently observed from highly inclined galaxies at high-redshift.\n", "  The mass scaling relation between supermassive black holes and their host\nspheroids has previously been described by a quadratic or steeper relation at\nlow masses (10^5 < M_bh/M_sun < 10^7). How this extends into the realm of\nintermediate mass black holes (10^2 < M_bh/M_sun < 10^5) is not yet clear,\nalthough for the barred Sm galaxy LEDA 87300, Baldassare et al. have recently\nreported a nominal virial mass M_bh=5x10^4 M_sun residing in a `spheroid' of\nstellar mass equal to 6.3x10^8 M_sun. We point out, for the first time, that\nLEDA 87300 therefore appears to reside on the near-quadratic M_bh-M_{sph,*}\nrelation. However, Baldassare et al. modelled the bulge _and_ bar as the single\nspheroidal component of this galaxy. Here we perform a 3-component\nbulge+bar+disk decomposition and find a bulge luminosity which is 7.7 times\nfainter than the published `bulge' luminosity. After correcting for dust we\nfind that M_bulge=0.9x10^8 M_sun, and M_bulge/M_disk=0.04 - which is now in\naccord with ratios typically found in Scd-Sm galaxies. We go on to discuss\nslight revisions to the stellar velocity dispersion (40+/-11 km/s) and black\nhole mass (M_bh=2.9x10^4 M_sun) and show that LEDA 87300 remains consistent\nwith both the M_bh-sigma relation and the near-quadratic M_bh-M_{sph,*}\nrelation when using the reduced bulge mass. LEDA 87300 therefore offers the\nfirst support for the rapid but regulated (near-quadratic) growth of black\nholes, relative to their host bulge/spheroid, extending into the domain of\nintermediate mass black holes.\n", "  We analyze archival Chandra HRC observations of the ultra luminous accreting\npulsar M82-X2 (NuSTAR J095551+6940.8), and determine an upper limit of $<\n1.7\\times 10^{38}$~erg/s to its luminosity at an epoch at which it was\nundetected. Combined with other recent measurements, this confirms that the\nsource X-ray emission has been highly variable during the last 15 years,\nranging from a maximum of $10^{40}$ erg/s through intermediate values $\\sim$ a\nfew $\\times 10^{39}$ erg/s, and down to a minimum that must be below the\ncurrent detection threshold $\\sim (2-3) \\times 10^{38}$ erg/s . We interpret\nthese results by means of a magnetically-threaded disk model: when at peak\nluminosity, the neutron star (NS) is close to spin equilibrium, its inner disk\nedge r_m ~ 10^8 cm is approximately half the corotation radius r_{co}, and\nradiation pressure dominates the disk out to r_{tr} ~ 10^9 cm. In the radiation\npressure-dominated regime, r_m grows very slowly as the mass inflow rate drops:\nas a result, r_m < r_{co} remains valid until the mass accretion rate becomes ~\nthe Eddington accretion rate, allowing a wide range of accretion luminosities\nto the NS. Once the mass accretion rate is below Eddington, accretion onto the\nNS is inhibited because r_m > r_{co}, and the source luminosity is expected to\ndrop by a large factor. We conclude that a magnetically threaded, radiation\npressure-dominated disk, around a highly magnetized NS (B~10^{13} G) offers the\nbest intepretation for all the currently observed properties of NuSTAR\nJ095551+6940.8. This source offers an unprecedented opportunity to study the\ndisk-magnetosphere interaction in a new regime of supercritical accretion, and\nacross the transition between-radiation pressure and gas-pressure dominance\ninside the disk.\n", "  The report studies transformation of a Ge granular film deposited at room\ntemperature on the Si(001) surface to the Ge/Si(001) heterostructure as a\nresult of rapid heating and annealing at 600C. As a result of the short-term\nannealing at 600C in conditions of a closed system, the Ge granular film\ntransforms to the usual wetting layer and Ge clusters with multimodal size\ndistribution and the Ge oval drops having the highest number density. After the\nlong-term thermal treatment of the Ge film at the same temperature, Ge drops\ndisappear; the large clusters increase their sizes at the expense of the\nsmaller ones. The total density of Ge clusters on the surface drastically\ndecreases. The wetting layer mixed c(4 x 2) + p(2 x 2) reconstruction\ntransforms to the single c(4 x 2) one which is likely thermodynamically\nfavoured. Pyramids or domes are not observed on the surface after any\nannealing.\n", "  We analyse all available observations of GX 339--4 by XMM-Newton in the hard\nspectral state. We jointly fit the spectral data by Comptonization and the\ncurrently best reflection code, relxill. We consider in detail a contribution\nfrom a standard blackbody accretion disc, testing whether its inner radius can\nbe set equal to that of the reflector. However, this leads to an unphysical\nbehaviour of the disc truncation radius, implying the soft X-ray component is\nnot a standard blackbody disc. This appears to be due to irradiation by the\nhard X-rays, which strongly dominate the total emission. We consider a large\narray of models, testing, e.g., the effects of the chosen energy range, of\nadding unblurred reflection, and assuming a lamppost geometry. We find the\neffects of relativistic broadening to be relatively weak in all cases. In the\ncoronal models, we find the inner radius to be large. In the lamppost model,\nthe inner radius is unconstrained, but when fixed to the innermost stable\norbit, the height of the source is large, which also implies a weak\nrelativistic broadening. In the former models, the inner radius correlates with\nthe X-ray hardness ratio, which is consistent with the presence of a truncated\ndisc turning into a complete disc in the soft state. We also find the degree of\nthe disc ionization to anti-correlate with the hardness, leading to strong\nspectral broadening due to scattering of reflected photons in the reflector in\nthe softest studied states.\n", "  We present new optical observations of the supernova SN 1978K, obtained in\n2007 and 2014 with the Very Large Telescope. We discover that the supernova has\nnot faded significantly, even more than three decades after its explosion. The\nspectrum exhibits numerous narrow (FWHM $\\lesssim600$ km s$^{-1}$) emission\nlines, indicating that the supernova blastwave is persistently interacting with\ndense circumstellar material (CSM). Evolution of emission lines indicates that\nthe supernova ejecta is slowly progressing through the reverse shock, and has\nnot expanded past the outer edge of the circumstellar envelope. We demonstrate\nthat the CSM is not likely to be spherically distributed, with mass of\n$\\lesssim$ 1 M$_\\odot$. The progenitor mass loss rate is estimated as $\\gtrsim\n0.01$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The slowly fading late-time light curve and spectra\nshow striking similarity with SN 1987A, indicating that a rate at which the CSM\nis being swept-up by the blastwave is gradually decaying and SN 1978K is\nundergoing similar evolution to become a remnant. Due to its proximity (4 Mpc),\nSN 1978K serves as the next best example of late-time supernova evolution after\nSN 1987A.\n", "  The inherently high computational cost of iterative self-consistent-field\n(SCF) methods proves to be a critical issue delaying visual and haptic feedback\nin real-time quantum chemistry. In this work, we introduce two schemes for SCF\nacceleration. They provide a guess for the initial density matrix of the SCF\nprocedure generated by extrapolation techniques. SCF optimizations then\nconverge in fewer iterations, which decreases the execution time of the SCF\noptimization procedure. To benchmark the proposed propagation schemes, we\ndeveloped a test bed for performing quantum chemical calculations on sequences\nof molecular structures mimicking real-time quantum chemical explorations.\nExplorations of a set of six model reactions employing the semi-empirical\nmethods PM6 and DFTB3 in this testing environment showed that the proposed\npropagation schemes achieved speedups of up to thirty percent as a consequence\nof a reduced number of SCF iterations.\n", "  We demonstrate the creation of entangled, spin-squeezed states using a\ncollective, or joint, measurement and real-time feedback. The pseudospin state\nof an ensemble of $N= 5\\times 10^4$ laser-cooled $^{87}$Rb atoms is\ndeterministically driven to a specified population state with angular\nresolution that is a factor of 5.5(8) [7.4(6)~dB] in variance below the\nstandard quantum limit for unentangled atoms --- comparable to the best\nenhancements using only unitary evolution. Without feedback, conditioning on\nthe outcome of the joint premeasurement, we directly observe up to 59(8) times\n[17.7(6)~dB] improvement in quantum phase variance relative to the standard\nquantum limit for $N=4\\times 10^5$ atoms. This is one of the largest reported\nentanglement enhancements to date in any system.\n", "  Many models on the market allow for particles carrying both lepton number and\ncolor, e.g., leptoquarks and leptogluons. Some of the models with this feature\ncan also accommodate color-singlet leptohadrons. We have found that the\nlong-standing discrepancy between the experimental result and the Standard\nModel prediction for the muon anomalous magnetic moment can be explained by the\neffect of leptomesons within the wide allowed range of their masses and\ncouplings. These new particles are testable at the current run of the LHC.\n", "  Spectral line survey observations of 7 molecular clouds in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC) have been conducted in the 3 mm band with the Mopra 22 m\ntelescope to reveal chemical compositions in low metallicity conditions.\nSpectral lines of fundamental species such as CS, SO, CCH, HCN, HCO+, and HNC\nare detected in addition to those of CO and 13CO, while CH3OH is not detected\nin any source and N2H+ is marginally detected in two sources. The\nmolecular-cloud scale (10 pc scale) chemical composition is found to be similar\namong the 7 sources regardless of different star formation activities, and\nhence, it represents the chemical composition characteristic to the LMC without\ninfluences of star formation activities. In comparison with chemical\ncompositions of Galactic sources, the characteristic features are (1) deficient\nN-bearing molecules, (2) abundant CCH, and (3) deficient CH3OH. The feature (1)\nis due to a lower elemental abundance of nitrogen in the LMC, whereas the\nfeatures (2) and (3) seem to originate from extended photodissociation regions\nand warmer temperature in cloud peripheries due to a lower abundance of dust\ngrains in the low metallicity condition. In spite of general resemblance of\nchemical abundances among the seven sources, the CS/HCO+ and SO/HCO+ ratios are\nfound to be slightly higher in a quiescent molecular cloud. An origin of this\ntrend is discussed in relation to possible depletion of sulfur along molecular\ncloud formation.\n", "  This study demonstrates the significant effect of the recoil pressure and\nMarangoni convection in laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) of 316L stainless\nsteel. A three-dimensional high fidelity powder-scale model reveals how the\nstrong dynamical melt flow generates pore defects, material spattering\n(sparking), and denudation zones. The melt track is divided into three\nsections: a topological depression, a transition and a tail region, each being\nthe location of specific physical effects. The inclusion of laser ray-tracing\nenergy deposition in the powder-scale model improves over traditional\nvolumetric energy deposition. It enables partial particle melting, which\nimpacts pore defects in the denudation zone. Different pore formation\nmechanisms are observed at the edge of a scan track, at the melt pool bottom\n(during collapse of the pool depression), and at the end of the melt track\n(during laser power ramp down). Remedies to these undesirable pores are\ndiscussed. The results are validated against the experiments and the\nsensitivity to laser absorptivity is discussed.\n", "  Rotational modulations of brown dwarfs have recently provided powerful\nconstraints on the properties of ultra-cool atmospheres, including longitudinal\nand vertical cloud structures and cloud evolution. Furthermore, periodic light\ncurves directly probe the rotational periods of ultra-cool objects. We present\nhere, for the first time, time-resolved high-precision photometric measurements\nof a planetary-mass companion, 2M1207b. We observed the binary system with\nHST/WFC3 in two bands and with two spacecraft roll angles. Using point spread\nfunction-based photometry, we reach a nearly photon-noise limited accuracy for\nboth the primary and the secondary. While the primary is consistent with a flat\nlight curve, the secondary shows modulations that are clearly detected in the\ncombined light curve as well as in different subsets of the data. The\namplitudes are 1.36% in the F125W and 0.78% in the F160W filters, respectively.\nBy fitting sine waves to the light curves, we find a consistent period of\n$10.7^{+1.2}_{-0.6}$ hours and similar phases in both bands. The J- and H-band\namplitude ratio of 2M1207b is very similar to a field brown dwarf that has\nidentical spectral type but different J-H color. Importantly, our study also\nmeasures, for the first time, the rotation period for a directly imaged\nextra-solar planetary-mass companion.\n", "  In this paper, we will discuss a specific case that the dark matter particles\nannihilate into right-handed neutrinos. We calculate the predicted gamma-ray\nexcess from the galactic center and compare our results with the data from the\nFermi-LAT. An approximately 10-60 GeV right-handed neutrino with heavier dark\nmatter particle can perfectly explain the observed spectrum. The annihilation\ncross section $\\langle \\sigma v \\rangle$ falls within the range $0.5$-$4 \\times\n10^{-26} \\text{ cm}^3/\\text{s}$, which is roughly compatible with the WIMP\nannihilation cross section.\n", "  Realistic astrophysical environments are turbulent due to the extremely high\nReynolds numbers. Therefore, the theories of reconnection intended for\ndescribing astrophysical reconnection should not ignore the effects of\nturbulence on magnetic reconnection. Turbulence is known to change the nature\nof many physical processes dramatically and in this review we claim that\nmagnetic reconnection is not an exception. We stress that not only\nastrophysical turbulence is ubiquitous, but also magnetic reconnection itself\ninduces turbulence. Thus turbulence must be accounted for in any realistic\nastrophysical reconnection setup. We argue that due to the similarities of MHD\nturbulence in relativistic and non-relativistic cases the theory of magnetic\nreconnection developed for the non-relativistic case can be extended to the\nrelativistic case and we provide numerical simulations that support this\nconjecture. We also provide quantitative comparisons of the theoretical\npredictions and results of numerical experiments, including the situations when\nturbulent reconnection is self-driven, i.e. the turbulence in the system is\ngenerated by the reconnection process itself. We show how turbulent\nreconnection entails the violation of magnetic flux freezing, the conclusion\nthat has really far reaching consequences for many realistically turbulent\nastrophysical environments. In addition, we consider observational testing of\nturbulent reconnection as well as numerous implications of the theory. The\nformer includes the Sun and solar wind reconnection, while the latter include\nthe process of reconnection diffusion induced by turbulent reconnection, the\nacceleration of energetic particles, bursts of turbulent reconnection related\nto black hole sources as well as gamma ray bursts. Finally, we explain why\nturbulent reconnection cannot be explained by turbulent resistivity or derived\nthrough the mean field approach.\n", "  In a previous publication by some of the authors (N.E.M., M.S. and M.F.Y.),\nwe have argued that the \"D-material universe\", that is a model of a brane world\npropagating in a higher-dimensional bulk populated by collections of D-particle\nstringy defects, provides a model for the growth of large-scale structure in\nthe universe via the vector field in its spectrum. The latter corresponds to\nD-particle recoil velocity excitations as a result of the interactions of the\ndefects with stringy matter and radiation on the brane world. In this article,\nwe first elaborate further on the results of the previous study on the galactic\ngrowth era and analyse the circumstances under which the D-particle recoil\nvelocity fluid may \"mimic\" dark matter in galaxies. A lensing phenomenology is\nalso presented for some samples of galaxies, which previously were known to\nprovide tension for modified gravity (TeVeS) models. The current model is found\nin agreement with these lensing data. Then we discuss a cosmic evolution for\nthe D-material universe by analysing the conditions under which the late eras\nof this universe associated with large-scale structure are connected to early\nepochs, where inflation takes place. It is shown that inflation is induced by\ndense populations of D-particles in the early universe, with the role of the\ninflaton field played by the condensate of the D-particle recoil-velocity\nfields under their interaction with relativistic stringy matter, only for\nsufficiently large brane tensions and low string mass scales compared to the\nHubble scale. On the other hand, for large string scales, where the\nrecoil-velocity condensate fields are weak, inflation cannot be driven by the\nD-particle defects alone. In such cases inflation may be driven by dilaton (or\nother moduli) fields in the underlying string theory.\n", "  We present a detailed study of dark matter phenomenology in low-scale\nleft-right symmetric models. Stability of new fermion or scalar multiplets is\nensured by an accidental matter parity that survives the spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking of the gauge group by scalar triplets. The relic abundance of these\nparticles is set by gauge interactions and gives rise to dark matter candidates\nwith masses above the electroweak scale. Dark matter annihilations are thus\nmodified by the Sommerfeld effect, not only in the early Universe, but also\ntoday, for instance, in the Center of the Galaxy. Majorana candidates -\ntriplet, quintuplet, bi-doublet, and bi-triplet - bring only one new parameter\nto the model, their mass, and are hence highly testable at colliders and\nthrough astrophysical observations. Scalar candidates - doublet and 7-plet, the\nlatter being only stable at the renormalizable level - have additional\nscalar-scalar interactions that give rise to rich phenomenology. The particles\nunder discussion share many features with the well-known candidates wino,\nHiggsino, inert doublet scalar, sneutrino, and Minimal Dark Matter. In\nparticular, they all predict a large gamma-ray flux from dark matter\nannihilations, which can be searched for with Cherenkov telescopes. We\nfurthermore discuss models with unequal left-right gauge couplings, $g_R \\neq\ng_L$, taking the recent experimental hints for a charged gauge boson with 2 TeV\nmass as a benchmark point. In this case, the dark matter mass is determined by\nthe observed relic density.\n", "  Context: Studies of extremely metal-poor stars indicate that chemical\nabundance ratios [X/Fe] have an rms scatter as low as 0.05 dex (12 \\%). It\nremains unclear whether this reflects observational uncertainties or intrinsic\nastrophysical scatter arising from physical conditions in the ISM at early\ntimes. Aims: Measure differential chemical abundance ratios in extremely\nmetal-poor stars to investigate the limits of precision and to understand\nwhether cosmic scatter or observational errors are dominant. Methods: We used\nhigh resolution (R $\\sim 95,000$) and high S/N (S/N $= 700$ at 5000$\\AA$)\nHIRES/Keck spectra, to determine high precision differential abundances between\ntwo extremely metal-poor stars through a line-by-line differential approach. We\ndetermined stellar parameters for the star G64-37 with respect to the standard\nstar G64-12. We performed EW measurements for the two stars for the lines\nrecognized in both stars and performed spectral synthesis to study the carbon\nabundances. Results: The differential approach allowed us to obtain errors of\n$\\sigma$(T$_{eff}$ ) $=$ 27 K, $\\sigma$(log $g$) $=$ 0.06 dex, $\\sigma$([Fe/H])\n$=$ 0.02 dex and $\\sigma$(v$_{t}$ ) $=$ 0.06 kms$^{-1}$. We estimated relative\nchemical abundances with a precision as low as $\\sigma$([X/Fe]) $\\approx$ 0.01\ndex. The small uncertainties demonstrate that there are genuine abundance\ndifferences larger than the measurement errors. The observed Li difference can\nnot be explained by the difference in mass, because the less massive star has\nmore Li. Conclusions: It is possible to achieve an abundance precision around\n$\\approx$ 0.01-0.05 dex for extremely metal-poor stars, opening new windows on\nthe study of the early chemical evolution of the Galaxy.\n", "  We examine radiation-regulated accretion onto intermediate-mass and massive\nblack holes (BHs) embedded in a bulge component. Using spherically symmetric\none-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, we track the growth of BHs\naccreting from a cold, neutral gas reservoir with temperature T=10^4 K. We find\nthat the accretion rate of BHs embedded in bulges is proportional to\nr_{B,eff}/r_B, where r_{B,eff} is the increased effective Bondi radius that\nincludes the gravitational potential of the bulge, and r_B is the Bondi radius\nof the BH. The radiative feedback from the BH suppresses the cold accretion\nrate to ~1 percent of the Bondi rate when a bulge is not considered. However,\nwe find that the BH fueling rate increases rapidly when the bulge mass M_bulge\nis greater than the critical value of 10^6 M_sun and is proportional to\nM_bulge. Since the critical bulge mass is independent of the central BH mass\nM_{BH}, the growth rate of BHs with masses of 10^2, 10^4, and 10^6 M_sun\nexhibits distinct dependencies on the bulge-to-BH mass ratio. Our results imply\nthat light seed BHs (<= 10^2 M_sun) which might be the remnants of the Pop III\nstars, cannot grow through accretion coevally with the early assembly of the\nbulge of the host galaxies until the bulge reaches the critical mass. However,\nmassive BH seeds (>= 10^5 M_sun) that may form via direct collapse, are more\nlikely to be embedded in a supercritical bulge and thus can grow efficiently\ncoupling to the host galaxies and driving the early evolution of the\nM_{BH}-$\\sigma$ relationship.\n", "  We examine a large random sample of orbits in self-consistent simulations of\nN-body bars. Orbits in the bars are classified both visually and with a new\nautomated orbit classification method based on frequency analysis. The well\nknown prograde x1 orbit family originates from the same parent orbit as the box\norbits in stationary and rotating triaxial ellipsoids. However only a small\nfraction of bar orbits ~4% have predominately prograde motion like their\nperiodic parent orbit. Most bar orbits arising from the x1 orbit have little\nnet angular momentum in the bar frame making them equivalent to box orbits in\nrotating triaxial potentials. A small fraction of bar orbits (~7%) are long\naxis tubes that behave exactly like those in triaxial ellipsoids:they are\ntipped about the intermediate-axis due to the Coriolis force, with the sense of\ntipping determined by the sign of their angular momentum about the long axis.\nNo orbits parented by prograde periodic x2 orbits are found in the pure bar\nmodel, but a tiny population (~2%) of short axis tube orbits parented by\nretrograde x4 orbits are found. When a central point mass representing a\nsupermassive black hole (SMBH) is grown adiabatically at the center of the bar,\nthose orbits that lie in the immediate vicinity of the SMBH are transformed\ninto precessing Keplerian orbits (PKOs) which belong the same major families\n(short axis tubes, long axis tubes and boxes) occupying the bar at larger\nradii. During the growth of a SMBH the inflow of mass and outward transport of\nangular momentum transforms some x1 and long axis tube orbits into prograde\nshort axis tubes. This study has important implications for future attempts to\nconstrain the masses of SMBHs in barred galaxies using orbit based methods like\nthe Schwarzschild orbit superposition scheme and for understanding the observed\nfeatures in barred galaxies.\n", "  Imaging companions to main-sequence stars often allows to detect a projected\norbital motion. MCMC has become very popular in for fitting their orbits. Some\nof these companions appear to move on very eccentric, possibly unbound orbits.\nThis is the case for the exoplanet Fomalhaut b and the brown dwarf companion PZ\nTel B. For such orbits, standard MCMC codes assuming only bound orbits may be\ninappropriate. We develop a new MCMC implementation able to handle bound and\nunbound orbits as well in a continuous manner, and we apply it to the cases of\nFomalhaut b and PZ Tel B.\n  This code is based on universal Keplerian variables and Stumpff functions\nformalism. We present two versions of this code, the second one using a\ndifferent set of angular variables designed to avoid degeneracies arising when\nthe projected orbital motion is quasi-radial, as it is the case for PZ Tel B.\nWe also present additional observations of PZ Tel B.\n  The code is applied to Fomalhaut b and PZ Tel B. Concerning Fomalhaut b, we\nconfirm previous results, but we show that open orbital solutions are also\npossible. The eccentricity distribution nevertheless peaks around ~0.9 in the\nbound regime. We present a first successful orbital fit of PZ Tel B, showing in\nparticular that the eccentricity distribution presents a sharp peak very close\nto e=1, meaning a quasi-parabolic orbit.\n  It was recently suggested that unseen inner companions may lead orbital\nfitting algorithms to artificially give high eccentricities. We show that this\ncaveat is unlikely to apply to Fomalhaut b. Concerning PZ Tel B, an inner ~12\nMJup companion would mimic a e=1 orbit despite a real eccentricity around 0.7,\nbut a dynamical analysis reveals that such a system would not be stable. We\nconclude that our orbital fit is robust.\n", "  We present millimetre (SMA) and sub-millimetre (SCUBA-2) continuum\nobservations of the peculiar star KIC 8462852 which displayed several deep and\naperiodic dips in brightness during the Kepler mission. Our observations are\napproximately confusion-limited at 850 $\\mu$m and are the deepest millimetre\nand sub-millimetre photometry of the star that has yet been carried out. No\nsignificant emission is detected towards KIC 8462852. We determine upper limits\nfor dust between a few 10$^{-6}$ M$_{\\oplus}$ and 10$^{-3}$ M$_{\\oplus}$ for\nregions identified as the most likely to host occluding dust clumps and a total\noverall dust budget of $<$7.7 M$_{\\oplus}$ within a radius of 200 AU. Such low\nlimits for the inner system make the catastrophic planetary disruption\nhypothesis unlikely. Integrating over the Kepler lightcurve we determine that\nat least 10$^{-9}$ M$_{\\oplus}$ of dust is required to cause the observed Q16\ndip. This is consistent with the currently most favoured cometary breakup\nhypothesis, but nevertheless implies the complete breakup of $\\sim$ 30 Comet\n1/P Halley type objects. Finally, in the wide SCUBA-2 field-of-view we identify\nanother candidate debris disc system that is potentially the largest yet\ndiscovered.\n", "  We study the radiative corrections induced by the triple Higgs boson coupling\n$hhh$ in the three body decay $h\\to ZZ^*\\to Zl\\bar l$. We show that these\ncorrections are potentially sensitive to the specific value of this coupling in\nthe Standard Model and the Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM). These effects may\ninduce corrections to the integrated decay width of the three-body decay of\norder few percent in the 2HDM and thus open a new window to test the Higgs\nboson self interaction in physics beyond the standard model.\n", "  This paper gives a theoretical formulation of the electromagnetic response of\nthe quasi-two-dimensional (Q2D) crystals suitable for investigation of optical\nactivity and polariton modes. The response to external electromagnetic field is\ndescribed by current-current response tensor $\\Pi_{\\mu\\nu}$ calculated by\nsolving the Dyson equation in the random phase approximation (RPA), where\ncurrent-current interaction is mediated by the photon propagator $D_{\\mu\\nu}$.\nThe irreducible current-current response tensor $\\Pi^0_{\\mu\\nu}$ is calculated\nfrom the {\\em ab initio} Kohn-Sham (KS) orbitals. The accuracy of\n$\\Pi^0_{\\mu\\nu}$ is tested in the long wavelength limit where it gives correct\nDrude dielectric function and conductivity. The theory is applied to the\ncalculation of optical absorption and conductivity in pristine and doped single\nlayer graphene and successfully compared with previous calculations and\nmeasurements.\n", "  Deviations from the standard model prediction have been observed in several\nleptonic and semileptonic $B$ meson decays to $\\tau\\nu$ final states mediated\nvia $b \\to u$ and $b \\to c$ charged current interactions. The measured value of\nratio of branching ratios $R_{\\pi}^l$ of $B^- \\to \\tau^-\\,\\nu_{\\tau}$ to $B^0\n\\to \\pi^+\\,\\l^-\\,\\nu$ decays, where $l = (e,\\,\\mu)$, is larger than the\nstandard model prediction by more than a factor of two. Similarly, a combined\nexcess of $3.9\\sigma$ from the standard model expectation has been reported by\nHFAG for the values of $R_D$ and $R_{D^{\\ast}}$, where $R_{D,\\,D^{\\ast}}$\nrepresents the ratio of branching ratios of $B \\to (D,\\,D^{\\ast})\\,\\tau\\nu$ to\ncorresponding $B \\to (D,\\,D^{\\ast})\\,l\\nu$ decays, respectively. Very recently,\nhint of lepton flavor violation has been observed in the ratio of branching\nfractions of $B \\to K\\,e^+\\,e^-$ to $B \\to K\\,\\mu^+\\,\\mu^-$ decays as well. In\nthis context, we employ an effective Lagrangian approach to study the decay\nbranching fractions and the ratio of branching fractions of $\\Lambda_b \\to\n\\Lambda_c\\,l\\,\\nu$ and $\\Lambda_b \\to p\\,l\\,\\nu$ decays within the standard\nmodel and beyond. We constrain the new physics parameter space using the\nexisting experimental data on $R_D$, $R_{D^{\\ast}}$, and $R_{\\pi}^l$. We give\npredictions for various observables in the context of various new physics\nscenarios.\n", "  We report on a theoretical study of the electronic structures of the\n[111]-oriented, free-standing, zincblende InAs and InP nanowires with hexagonal\ncross sections by means of an atomistic $sp^{3}s^{*} $, spin-orbit interaction\nincluded, nearest-neighbor, tight-binding method. The band structures and the\nband state wave functions of these nanowires are calculated and the symmetry\nproperties of the bands and band states are analyzed based on the $C_{3v}$\ndouble point group. It is shown that all bands of these nanowires are doubly\ndegenerate at the $\\Gamma$-point and some of these bands will split into\nnon-degenerate bands when the wave vector $k$ moves away from the\n$\\Gamma$-point as a manifestation of spin-splitting due to spin-orbit\ninteraction. It is also shown that the lower conduction bands of these\nnanowires all show simple parabolic dispersion relations, while the top valence\nbands show complex dispersion relations and band crossings. The band state wave\nfunctions are presented by the spatial probability distributions and it is\nfound that all the band states show $2\\pi/3$-rotation symmetric probability\ndistributions. The effects of quantum confinement on the band structures of the\n[111]-oriented InAs and InP nanowires are also examined and an empirical\nformula for the description of quantization energies of the lowest conduction\nband and the highest valence band is presented. The formula can simply be used\nto estimate the enhancement of the band gaps of the nanowires at different\nsizes as a result of quantum confinement.\n", "  We report the homonuclear photoassociation (PA) of ultracold\n${}^{52}\\mathrm{Cr}$ atoms in an optical dipole trap. This constitutes the\nfirst measurement of PA in an element with total electron spin $\\tilde{S}>1$.\nAlthough Cr, with its ${}^{7}\\mathrm{S}_{3}$ ground and\n${}^{7}\\mathrm{P}_{4,3,2}$ excited states, is expected to have a complicated PA\nspectrum we show that a spin polarized cloud exhibits a remarkably simple PA\nspectrum when circularly polarized light is applied. Over a scan range of 20\nGHz below the ${}^{7}\\mathrm{P}_{3}$ asymptote we observe two distinct\nvibrational series each following a LeRoy-Bernstein law for a $C_3 / R^{3}$\npotential with excellent agreement. We determine the $C_3$ coefficients of the\nHund's case c) relativistic adiabatic potentials to be -1.83$\\pm$0.02 a.u. and\n-1.46$\\pm$0.01a.u.. Theoretical non-rotating Movre-Pichler calculations enable\na first assignment of the series to $\\Omega=6_u$ and $5_g$ potential energy\ncurves. In a different set of experiments we disturb the selection rules by a\ntransverse magnetic field which leads to additional PA series.\n", "  We discuss the dissipative preparation of p-wave superconductors in\nnumber-conserving one-dimensional fermionic systems. We focus on two setups:\nthe first one entails a single wire coupled to a bath, whereas in the second\none the environment is connected to a two-leg ladder. Both settings lead to\nstationary states which feature the bulk properties of a p-wave superconductor,\nidentified in this number-conserving setting through the long-distance behavior\nof the proper p-wave correlations. The two schemes differ in the fact that the\nsteady state of the single wire is not characterized by topological order,\nwhereas the two-leg ladder hosts Majorana zero modes, which are decoupled from\ndamping and exponentially localized at the edges. Our analytical results are\ncomplemented by an extensive numerical study of the steady-state properties, of\nthe asymptotic decay rate and of the robustness of the protocols.\n", "  An angular analysis of the $B^{0}\\rightarrow K^{*0}(\\rightarrow\nK^{+}\\pi^{-})\\mu^{+}\\mu^{-}$ decay is presented. The dataset corresponds to an\nintegrated luminosity of $3.0\\,{\\mbox{fb}^{-1}}$ of $pp$ collision data\ncollected at the LHCb experiment. The complete angular information from the\ndecay is used to determine $C\\!P$-averaged observables and $C\\!P$ asymmetries,\ntaking account of possible contamination from decays with the $K^{+}\\pi^{-}$\nsystem in an S-wave configuration. The angular observables and their\ncorrelations are reported in bins of $q^2$, the invariant mass squared of the\ndimuon system. The observables are determined both from an unbinned maximum\nlikelihood fit and by using the principal moments of the angular distribution.\nIn addition, by fitting for $q^2$-dependent decay amplitudes in the region\n$1.1<q^{2}<6.0\\mathrm{\\,Ge\\kern -0.1em V}^{2}/c^{4}$, the zero-crossing points\nof several angular observables are computed. A global fit is performed to the\ncomplete set of $C\\!P$-averaged observables obtained from the maximum\nlikelihood fit. This fit indicates differences with predictions based on the\nStandard Model at the level of 3.4 standard deviations. These differences could\nbe explained by contributions from physics beyond the Standard Model, or by an\nunexpectedly large hadronic effect that is not accounted for in the Standard\nModel predictions.\n", "  Exciton edge states and the microwave edge exciton absorption of a 2D\ntopological insulator subject to the in-plane magnetic field are studied. The\nmagnetic field forms a narrow gap in electron edge states that allows the\nexistence of edge exciton. The exciton binding energy is found to be much\nsmaller than the energy of a 1D Coulomb state. Phototransitions exist on the\nexciton states with even numbers, while odd exciton states are dark.\n", "  Spin-driven nematic order that has been proposed for iron-based\nsuperconductors is generated by pronounced fluctuations of a striped density\nwave state. On the other hand it is a well known fact that nematic order\nparameter couples bilinearly to the strain, which supresses the fluctuations of\nthe nematic order parameter itself and lowers the upper critical dimension,\nyielding mean-field behaviour of the nematic degrees of freedom for $d>2$. This\nis consistent with the measured Currie-Weiss behaviour of the nematic\nsusceptibility. Here we reconcile this apparent contradiction between\npronounced magnetic fluctuations and mean-field behaviour of the nematic\ndegrees of freedom. We show, by developing a $\\varphi^4$ theory for the nematic\ndegrees of freedom, that the coupling to elastic strain does not suppress the\nfluctuations that cause the nematic order in the first place (magnetic\nfluctuations), yet it does transform the Ising-nematic transition into a\nmean-field transition. In addition, we demonstrate that the mean field behavior\noccurs in the entire temperature regime where a softening of the shear modulus\nis observed.\n", "  Basic atmospheric properties such as albedo and heat redistribution between\nday and nightside have been inferred for a number of planets using observations\nof secondary eclipses and thermal phase curves. Optical phase curves have not\nyet been used to constrain these atmospheric properties consistently. We\nre-model previously published phase curves of CoRoT-1b, TrES-2b and HAT-P-7b\nand infer albedos and recirculation efficiencies. These are then compared to\nprevious estimates based on secondary eclipse data. We use a physically\nconsistent model to construct optical phase curves. This model takes Lambertian\nreflection, thermal emission, ellipsoidal variations and Doppler boosting into\naccount. CoRoT-1b shows a non-negligible scattering albedo (0.11<AS<0.3 at 95%\nconfidence) as well as small day-night temperature contrasts, indicative of\nmoderate to high re-distribution of energy between dayside and nightside. These\nvalues are contrary to previous secondary eclipse and phase curve analyses. In\nthe case of HAT-P-7b, model results suggest relatively high scattering albedo\n(AS=0.3). This confirms previous phase curve analysis, however, it is in slight\ncontradiction to values inferred from secondary eclipse data. For TrES-2b, both\napproaches yield very similar estimates of albedo and heat recirculation.\nDiscrepancies between recirculation and albedo values as inferred from\nsecondary eclipse and optical phase curve analyses might be interpreted as a\nhint that optical and IR observations probe different atmospheric layers, and\nhence temperatures.\n", "  An evidence for a diphoton resonance at a mass of 750 GeV has been observed\nin the data collected at the LHC run at a center of mass energy of 13 TeV. We\nexplore several interpretations of this signal in terms of Higgs-like\nresonances in a two-Higgs doublet model and its supersymmetric incarnation, in\nwhich the heavier CP-even and CP-odd states present in the model are produced\nin gluon fusion and decay into two photons through top quark loops. We show\nthat one cannot accommodate the observed signal in the minimal versions of\nthese models and that an additional particle content is necessary. We then\nconsider the possibility that vector-like quarks or leptons strongly enhance\nthe heavy Higgs couplings to photons and eventually gluons, without altering\nthose of the already observed 125 GeV state.\n", "  In this paper we compute the decay rates of massless scalar waves excited by\na star circularly orbiting around the non-extremal (general) and extremal BTZ\nblack holes. These decay rates are compared with the corresponding quantities\ncomputed in the corresponding dual conformal field theories respectively. We\nfind that matches are achieved in both cases.\n", "  Observations of short gamma-ray bursts indicate ongoing energy injection\nfollowing the prompt emission, with the most likely candidate being the birth\nof a rapidly rotating, highly magnetised neutron star. We utilise X-ray\nobservations of the burst remnant to constrain properties of the nascent\nneutron star, including its magnetic field-induced ellipticity and the\nsaturation amplitude of various oscillation modes. Moreover, we derive strict\nupper limits on the gravitational wave emission from these objects by looking\nonly at the X-ray light curve, showing the burst remnants are unlikely to be\ndetected in the near future using ground-based gravitational wave\ninterferometers such as Advanced LIGO.\n", "  Observations have suggested that some low-mass stars have larger radii than\npredicted by 1-D structure models. Some theoretical models have invoked very\nstrong interior magnetic fields (of order 1 MG or more) as a possible cause of\nsuch large radii. Whether fields of that strength could in principle by\ngenerated by dynamo action in these objects is unclear, and we do not address\nthe matter directly. Instead, we examine whether such fields could remain in\nthe interior of a low mass object for a significant time, and whether they\nwould have any other obvious signatures. First, we estimate timescales for the\nloss of strong fields by magnetic buoyancy instabilities. We consider a range\nof field strengths and simple morphologies, including both idealized flux tubes\nand smooth layers of field. We confirm some of our analytical estimates using\nthin flux tube magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the rise of buoyant\nfields in a fully-convective M-dwarf. Separately, we consider the Ohmic\ndissipation of such fields. We find that dissipation provides a complementary\nconstraint to buoyancy: while small-scale, fibril fields might be regenerated\nfaster than they rise, the dissipative heating associated with such fields\nwould in some cases greatly exceed the luminosity of the star. We show how\nthese constraints combine to yield limits on the internal field strength and\nmorphology in low-mass stars. In particular, we find that for stars of 0.3\nsolar masses, no fields in flux tubes stronger than about 800 kG are\nsimultaneously consistent with both constraints.\n", "  Benefiting from the index spinorial formalism, the Killing spinor equation is\nintegrated in six-dimensional spacetimes. The integrability conditions for the\nexistence of a Killing spinor are worked out and the Killing spinors are\nclassified in two algebraic types, in the first type the scalar curvature of\nthe spacetime must be negative, while in the second type the spacetime must be\nan Einstein manifold. In addition, the equations that define Killing-Yano (KY)\nand closed conformal Killing-Yano (CCKY) tensors are expressed in the index\nnotation and, as consequence, all non-vanishing KY and CCKY tensors that can be\ngenerated from a Killing spinor are made explicit.\n", "  We propose two simple quirk models to explain the recently reported 750 GeV\ndiphoton excesses at ATLAS and CMS. It is already well-known that a real\nsinglet scalar $\\phi$ with Yukawa couplings $\\phi \\bar X X$ to vector-like\nfermions $X$ with mass $m_X > m_\\phi/2$ can easily explain the observed signal,\nprovided $X$ carries both SM color and electric charge. We instead consider\nfirst the possibility that the pair production of a fermion, charged under both\nSM gauge groups and a confining $SU(3)_v$ gauge group, is responsible. If pair\nproduced it forms a quirky bound state, which promptly annihilates into gluons,\nphotons, v-gluons and possibly SM fermions. This is an extremely minimal model\nto explain the excess, but is already in some tension with existing displaced\nsearches, as well as dilepton and dijet resonance bounds. We therefore propose\na hybrid Quirk-Scalar model, in which the fermion of the simple $\\phi \\bar X X$\ntoy model is charged under the additional $SU(3)_v$ confining gauge group.\nConstraints on the new heavy fermion $X$ are then significantly relaxed. The\nmain additional signals of this model are possible dilepton, dijet and diphoton\nresonances at $\\sim$ 2 TeV or more from quirk annihilation, and the production\nof v-glueballs through quirk annihilation and $\\phi$ decay. The glueballs can\ngive rise to spectacular signatures, including displaced vertices and events\nwith leptons, photons and $Z$-bosons. If the Quirk-Scalar model is responsible\nfor the 750 GeV excess it should be discovered in one of these channels with 20\nor $300 \\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of LHC run 2 data.\n", "  The shell corrections and shell gaps in nuclei are systematically studied\nwith the latest Weizs\\\"acker-Skyrme (WS4) mass model. We find that most of\nasymmetric nuclei with (sub)-shell closures locate along the shell stability\nline (SSL), $N=1.37Z+13.5$, which might be due to a strong correlation between\nneutrons and protons near Fermi surface. The double magicity of nuclei\n$^{46}$Si and $^{78}$Ni is predicted according to the corresponding shell gaps,\nshell corrections and nuclear deformations. The unmeasured super-heavy nuclei\n$^{296}$118 and $^{298}$120, with relatively large shell gaps and shell\ncorrections, also locate along the SSL, whereas the traditional magic nucleus\n$^{298}$Fl evidently deviates from the line. The $\\alpha$-decay energies of\nsuper-heavy nuclei with $Z=113-126$ are simultaneously investigated by using\nthe WS4 model together with the radial basis function corrections. For\nsuper-heavy nuclei with large shell corrections, the smallest $\\alpha$-decay\nenergy for elements $Z=116$, 117 and 118 in their isotope chains locates at\n$N=178$ rather than $184$.\n", "  The evidence for a new singlet scalar particle from the 750 GeV diphoton\nexcess, and the absence of any other signal of new physics at the LHC so far,\nsuggest the existence of new coloured scalars. To study this possibility, we\npropose a supersymmetry inspired simplified model, extending the Standard Model\nwith a singlet scalar and with heavy scalar fields carrying both colour and\nelectric charges -- the `squarks'. To allow the latter to decay, and to\ngenerate the dark matter of the Universe, we also add a neutral fermion to the\nparticle content. We show that this model provides a two-parameter fit to the\nobserved diphoton excess consistently with cosmology, while the allowed\nparameter space is bounded by the consistency of the model. In the context of\nour simplified model this implies the existence of other supersymmetric\nparticles accessible at the LHC, rendering this scenario falsifiable. If this\nexcess persists, it will imply a paradigm shift in assessing supersymmetry\nbreaking and the role of scalars in low scale physics.\n", "  We study the spectral function of the 2D Hubbard model using cluster\nperturbation theory, and the density matrix renormalization group as a cluster\nsolver. We reconstruct the two-dimensional dispersion at, and away from\nhalf-filling using 2xL ladders, with L up to 80 sites, yielding results with\nunprecedented resolution in excellent agreement with quantum Monte Carlo. The\nmain features of the spectrum can be described with a mean-field dispersion,\nwhile kinks and pseudogap traced back to scattering between spin and charge\ndegrees of freedom.\n", "  A star wandering too close to a supermassive black hole (SMBH) will be\ntidally disrupted. Previous studies of such \"tidal disruption event\" (TDE)\nmostly focus on the stellar debris that are bound to the system, because they\ngive rise to luminous flares. On the other hand, half of the stellar debris in\nprinciple are unbound and can stream to a great distance, but so far there is\nno clear evidence that this \"unbound debris stream\" (UDS) exists. Motivated by\nthe fact that the circum-nuclear region around SMBHs is usually filled with\ndense molecular clouds (MCs), here we investigate the observational signatures\nresulting from the collision between an UDS and a MC, which is likely to happen\nhundreds of years after a TDE. We focus on $\\gamma$-ray emission ($0.1-10^5$\nGeV), which comes from the encounter of shock-accelerated cosmic rays with\nbackground protons and, more importantly, is not subject to extinction. We show\nthat because of the high proton density inside a MC, the peak $\\gamma$-ray\nluminosity, about $10^{39}~{\\rm erg~s^{-1}}$, is at least $100$ times greater\nthan that in the case without a MC (only with a smooth interstellar medium).\nThe luminosity decays on a time-scale of decades, depending on the distance of\nthe MC, and about a dozen of these \"TDE afterglows\" could be detected within a\ndistance of about $16$ Mpc by the future Cherenkov Telescope Array. Without\ncareful discrimination, these sources potentially could contaminate the\nsearches for starburt galaxies, galactic nuclei containing millisecond pulsars\nor dark-matter annihilation signals.\n", "  We use the Wilsonian functional Renormalisation Group (RG) to study quantum\ncorrections for the Higgs inflationary action including the effect of\ngravitons, and analyse the leading-order quantum gravitational corrections to\nthe Higgs' quartic coupling, as well as its non-minimal coupling to gravity and\nNewton's constant, at the inflationary regime and beyond. We explain how within\nthis framework the effect of Higgs and graviton loops can be sufficiently\nsuppressed during inflation, and we also place a bound on the corresponding\nvalue of the infrared RG cut-off scale during inflation. Finally, we briefly\ndiscuss the potential embedding of the model within the scenario of Asymptotic\nSafety, while all main equations are explicitly presented.\n", "  We suggest that the recently observed diphoton excess at 750 GeV comes from a\nquasi-degenerate bunch of gauge singlet scalars produced and decaying through\none or more vector-like fermions. This explains the broad nature of the\nresonance, even though the decay is loop-mediated. At the same time, the model\nkeeps the new Yukawa couplings in the perturbative region, which is necessary\nfor the stability of the potential.\n", "  ${\\cal N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills theory is a highly constrained theory, and\ntherefore a valuable tool to test the understanding of less constrained\nYang-Mills theories. Our aim is to use it to test our understanding of both the\nLandau gauge beyond perturbation theory as well as truncations of\nDyson-Schwinger equations in ordinary Yang-Mills theories. We derive the\ncorresponding equations within the usual one-loop truncation for the\npropagators after imposing the Landau gauge. We find a conformal solution in\nthis approximation, which surprisingly resembles many aspects of ordinary\nYang-Mills theories. We furthermore identify which role the Gribov-Singer\nambiguity in this context could play, should it exist in this theory.\n", "  The evidence of a new scalar particle $X$ from the 750 GeV diphoton excess,\nand the absence of any other signal of new physics at the LHC so far suggest\nthe existence of new colored scalars, which may be moderately light and thus\ncan induce sizable $X g g$ and $X \\gamma \\gamma$ couplings without resorting to\nvery strong interactions. Motivated by this speculation, we extend the\nManohar-Wise model by adding one gauge singlet scalar field. The resulting\ntheory then predicts one singlet dominated scalar $\\phi$ as well as three kinds\nof color-octet scalars, which can mediate through loops the $\\phi gg$ and $\\phi\n\\gamma \\gamma$ interactions. After fitting the model to the diphoton data at\nthe LHC, we find that in reasonable parameter regions the excess can be\nexplained at $1\\sigma$ level by the process $ g g \\to \\phi \\to \\gamma \\gamma$,\nand the best points predict the central value of the excess rate with\n$\\chi_{min}^2=2.32$, which corresponds to a $p$-value of $0.68$. We also\nconsider the constraints from various LHC Run I signals, and we conclude that,\nalthough these constraints are powerful in excluding the parameter space of the\nmodel, the best points are still experimentally allowed.\n", "  The variational approach to QCD in Coulomb gauge developed previously by the\nT\\\"ubingen group is improved by enlarging the space of quark trial vacuum wave\nfunctionals through a new Dirac structure in the quark-gluon coupling. Our\nansatz for the quark vacuum wave functional ensures that all linear divergences\ncancel in the quark gap equation resulting from the minimization of the energy\ncalculated to two-loop order. The logarithmic divergences are absorbed in a\nrenormalized coupling which is adjusted to reproduce the phenomenological value\nof the quark condensate. We also unquench the gluon propagator and show that\nthe unquenching effects are generally small and amount to a small reduction in\nthe mid-momentum regime.\n", "  Being interested in the compatibility of Asymptotic Safety with Hilbert space\npositivity (unitarity), we consider a local truncation of the functional RG\nflow which describes quantum gravity in $d>2$ dimensions and construct its\nlimit of exactly two dimensions. We find that in this limit the flow displays a\nnontrivial fixed point whose effective average action is a non-local functional\nof the metric. Its pure gravity sector is shown to correspond to a unitary\nconformal field theory with positive central charge $c=25$. Representing the\nfixed point CFT by a Liouville theory in the conformal gauge, we investigate\nits general properties and their implications for the Asymptotic Safety\nprogram. In particular, we discuss its field parametrization dependence and\nargue that there might exist more than one universality class of metric gravity\ntheories in two dimensions. Furthermore, studying the gravitational dressing in\n2D asymptotically safe gravity coupled to conformal matter we uncover a\nmechanism which leads to a complete quenching of the a priori expected\nKnizhnik-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov (KPZ) scaling. A possible connection of this\nprediction to Monte Carlo results obtained in the discrete approach to 2D\nquantum gravity based upon causal dynamical triangulations is mentioned.\nSimilarities of the fixed point theory to, and differences from, non-critical\nstring theory are also described. On the technical side, we provide a detailed\nanalysis of an intriguing connection between the Einstein-Hilbert action in\n$d>2$ dimensions and Polyakov's induced gravity action in two dimensions.\n", "  We present a novel semi-analytic solution describing the propagation of a\nspherical blast wave driven by a central energy source. The initial density\nprofile has a power-law function of the distance from the center and the energy\nis injected only into the central region at a rate given by a power-law\nfunction of time. This solution is composed of three regions separated by the\ncontact surface and the shock front. The innermost region is assumed to be\nuniform and the outside of the contact surface includes the shocked matter\ndescribed by self-similar solutions. We analytically derive the applicable\nrange of parameters of this solution from requirements to satisfy boundary\nconditions. We perform numerical simulations for flows with various values of\nparameters, some of which reside out of the thus derived applicable range, and\ncompare with the semi-analytic solutions.\n", "  The equivalent widths of MgII absorption in the circumgalactic medium (CGM)\ntrace the global star formation rate up to $z<6$, are larger for star-forming\ngalaxies than passively-evolving galaxies, and decrease with increasing\ndistance from the galaxy. We delve further into the physics involved by\ninvestigating gas kinematics and cloud column density distributions as a\nfunction of galaxy color, redshift, and projected distance from the galaxy\n(normalized by galaxy virial radius, $D/R_{\\rm vir}$). For 39 isolated galaxies\nat $0.3<z_{\\rm gal}<1.0$, we have detected MgII absorption in high-resolution\n($\\Delta v\\simeq 6.6$ km/s) spectra of background quasars within a projected\ndistance of $7<D<190$ kpc. We characterize the absorption velocity spread using\npixel-velocity two-point correlation functions. Velocity dispersions and cloud\ncolumn densities for blue galaxies do not differ with redshift nor with\n$D/R_{\\rm vir}$. This suggests that outflows continually replenish the CGM of\nblue galaxies with high velocity dispersion, large column density gas out to\nlarge distances. Conversely, absorption hosted by red galaxies evolves with\nredshift where the velocity dispersions (column densities) are smaller (larger)\nat $z_{\\rm gal}<0.656$. After taking into account larger possible velocities in\nmore massive galaxies, we find that there is no difference in the velocity\ndispersions or column densities for absorption hosted by red galaxies with\n$D/R_{\\rm vir}$. Thus, a lack of outflows in red galaxies causes the CGM to\nbecome more quiescent over time, with lower velocity dispersions and larger\ncolumn densities towards lower $z_{\\rm gal}$. The quenching of star formation\nappears to affect the CGM out to $D/R_{\\rm vir}=0.75$.\n", "  Background. One important ingredient for many applications of nuclear physics\nto astrophysics, nuclear energy, and stockpile stewardship are cross sections\nfor reactions of neutrons with rare isotopes. Since direct measurements are\noften not feasible, indirect methods, e.g. (d,p) reactions, should be used.\nThose (d,p) reactions may be viewed as three-body reactions and described with\nFaddeev techniques. Purpose. Faddeev equations in momentum space have a long\ntradition of utilizing separable interactions in order to arrive at sets of\ncoupled integral equations in one variable. Optical potentials representing the\neffective interactions in the neutron (proton) nucleus subsystem are usually\nnon-Hermitian as well as energy-dependent. Potential matrix elements as well as\ntransition matrix elements calculated with them must fulfill the reciprocity\ntheorem. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a separable,\nenergy-dependent representation of complex, energy-dependent optical potentials\nthat fulfill reciprocity exactly. Results. Starting from a separable,\nenergy-independent representation of global optical potentials based on a\ngeneralization of the Ernst-Shakin-Thaler (EST) scheme, a further\ngeneralization is needed to take into account the energy dependence.\nApplications to n$+^{48}$Ca, n$+^{208}$Pb, and p$+^{208}$Pb are investigated\nfor energies from 0 to 50~MeV with special emphasis on fulfilling reciprocity.\nConclusions. We find that the energy-dependent separable representation of\ncomplex, energy-dependent phenomenological optical potentials fulfills\nreciprocity exactly. In addition, taking into account the explicit energy\ndependence slightly improves the description of the $S$ matrix elements.\n", "  The direct detection of a stellar system that explodes as a Type Ia supernova\n(SN Ia) has not yet been successful. Various indirect methods have been used to\ninvestigate SN Ia progenitor systems but none have produced conclusive results.\nA prediction of single-degenerate models is that H- (or He-) rich material from\nthe envelope of the companion star should be swept up by the SN ejecta in the\nexplosion. Seven SNe Ia have been analysed to date looking for signs of H-rich\nmaterial in their late-time spectra and none were detected. We present results\nfrom new late-time spectra of 11 SNe Ia obtained at the Very Large Telescope\nusing XShooter and FORS2. We present the tentative detection of H-alpha\nemission for SN 2013ct, corresponding to ~0.007 Msun of stripped/ablated\ncompanion star material (under the assumptions of the spectral modelling). This\nmass is significantly lower than expected for single-degenerate scenarios,\nsuggesting that >0.1 Msun of H-rich is present but not observed. We do not\ndetect H-alpha emission in the other 10 SNe Ia. This brings the total sample of\nnormal SNe Ia with non-detections (<0.001-0.058 Msun) of H-rich material to 17\nevents. The simplest explanation for these non-detections is that these objects\ndid not result from the explosion of a CO white dwarf accreting matter from a\nH-rich companion star via Roche-lobe overflow or symbiotic channels. However,\nfurther spectral modelling is needed to confirm this. We also find no evidence\nof He-emission features, but models with He-rich companion stars are not\navailable to place mass limits.\n", "  We discuss the production of a heavy neutral Higgs boson of a CP-conserving\nTwo-Higgs-Doublet Model in gluon fusion and its decay into a four-fermion final\nstate, $gg (\\rightarrow VV) \\rightarrow e^+e^-\\mu^+\\mu^-/e^+e^-\\nu_l\\bar\\nu_l$.\nWe investigate the interference contributions to invariant mass distributions\nof the four-fermion final state and other relevant kinematical observables. The\nrelative importance of the different contributions is quantified for the\nprocess in the on-shell approximation, $gg\\rightarrow ZZ$. We show that\ninterferences of the heavy Higgs with the light Higgs boson and background\ncontributions are essential for a correct description of the differential cross\nsection. Even though they contribute below $\\mathcal{O}(10\\%)$ to those heavy\nHiggs signal cross sections, to which the experiments at the Large Hadron\nCollider were sensitive in its first run, we find that they are sizeable in\ncertain regions of the parameter space that are relevant for future heavy Higgs\nboson searches. In fact, the interference contributions can significantly\nenhance the experimental sensitivity to the heavy Higgs boson.\n", "  We study $\\mathfrak{g}$-valued Yang-Mills fields on cylinders\n$Z(G/H)=\\mathbb{R} \\times G/H$, where G/H is a compact seven-dimensional coset\nspace with $G_2$-structure, $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the Lie algebra of G, and Z(G/H)\ninherits a Spin(7)-structure. After imposing a general G-invariance condition,\nYang-Mills theory with torsion on Z(G/H) reduces to Newtonian mechanics of a\npoint particle moving in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ under the influence of some quartic\npotential and possibly additional constraints. The kinematics and dynamics\ndepends on the chosen coset space. We consider in detail three coset spaces\nwith nearly parallel $G_2$-structure and four coset spaces with\nSU(3)-structure. For each case, we analyze the critical points of the potential\nand present a range of finite-energy solutions. We also study a\nhigher-dimensional analog of the instanton equation. Its solutions yield\nG-invariant Spin(7)-instanton configurations on Z(G/H), which are special cases\nof Yang-Mills configurations with torsion.\n", "  The study of reionization history plays an important role in understanding\nthe evolution of our universe. It is commonly believed that the intergalactic\nmedium (IGM) in our universe are fully ionized today, however the reionizing\nprocess remains to be mysterious. A simple instantaneous reionization process\nis usually adopted in modern cosmology without direct observational evidence.\nHowever, the history of ionization fraction, $x_e(z)$ will influence cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) observables and constraints on optical depth $\\tau$.\nWith the mocked future data sets based on featured reionization model, we find\nthe bias on $\\tau$ introduced by instantaneous model can not be neglected. In\nthis paper, we study the cosmic reionization history in a model independent\nway, the so called principle component analysis (PCA) method, and reconstruct\n$x_e (z)$ at different redshift $z$ with the data sets of Planck, WMAP 9 years\ntemperature and polarization power spectra, combining with the baryon acoustic\noscillation (BAO) from galaxy survey and type Ia supernovae (SN) Union 2.1\nsample respectively. The results show that reconstructed $x_e(z)$ is consistent\nwith instantaneous behavior, however, there exists slight deviation from this\nbehavior at some epoch. With PCA method, after abandoning the noisy modes, we\nget stronger constraints, and the hints for featured $x_e(z)$ evolution could\nbecome a little more obvious.\n", "  Fluctuation theorems have become an important tool in single molecule\nbiophysics to measure free energy differences from non-equilibrium experiments.\nWhen significant coarse-graining or noise affect the measurements, the\ndetermination of the free energies becomes challenging. In order to address\nthis thermodynamic inference problem, we propose improved estimators of free\nenergy differences based on fluctuation theorems, which we test on a number of\nexamples. The effect of the noise can be described by an effective temperature,\nwhich only depends on the signal to noise ratio, when the work is Gaussian\ndistributed and uncorrelated with the error made on the work. The notion of\neffective temperature appears less useful for non-Gaussian work distributions\nor when the error is correlated with the work, but nevertheless, as we show,\nimproved estimators can still be constructed for such cases. As an example of\nnon-trivial correlations between the error and the work, we also consider\nmeasurements with delay, as described by linear Langevin equations.\n", "  Construction of a supersymmetric extension of the Skyrme term was a\nlong-standing problem because of the auxiliary field problem; that is, the\nauxiliary field may propagate and cannot be eliminated, and the problem of\nhaving fourth-order time derivative terms. In this paper, we construct for the\nfirst time a supersymmetric extension of the Skyrme term in four spacetime\ndimensions, in the manifestly supersymmetric superfield formalism that does not\nsuffer from the auxiliary field problem. Chiral symmetry breaking in\nsupersymmetric theories results not only in Nambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons (pions)\nbut also in the same number of quasi-NG bosons so that the low-energy theory is\ndescribed by an SL(N,C)-valued matrix field instead of SU(N) for NG bosons. The\nsolution of auxiliary fields is trivial on the canonical branch of the\nauxiliary field equation, in which case our model results in a fourth-order\nderivative term that is not the Skyrme term. For the case of SL(2,C), we find\nexplicitly a nontrivial solution to the algebraic auxiliary field equations\nthat we call a non-canonical branch, which when substituted back into the\nLagrangian gives a Skyrme-like model. If we restrict to a submanifold, where\nquasi-NG bosons are turned off, which is tantamount to restricting the Skyrme\nfield to SU(2), then the fourth-order derivative term reduces exactly to the\nstandard Skyrme term. Our model is the first example of a nontrivial auxiliary\nfield solution in a multi-component model.\n", "  The tentative hints for a diphoton resonance at a mass of $\\sim 750$ GeV from\nthe ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC may be interpreted as first contact\nwith a \"dark\" sector with a spontaneously broken conformal symmetry. The\nimplied TeV scale of the dark sector may be motivated by the interaction\nstrength required to accommodate a viable thermal relic dark matter (DM)\ncandidate. We model the conformal dynamics using a Randall-Sundrum type 5D\ngeometry whose IR boundary is identified with the dynamics of the composite\ndark sector, while the Standard Model (SM) matter content resides on the UV\nboundary, corresponding to \"elementary\" fields. We allow the gauge fields to\nreside in the 5D bulk, which can be minimally chosen to be $SU(3)_c\\times\nU(1)_Y$. The \"dark\" radion is identified as the putative 750 GeV resonance.\nHeavy vector-like fermions, often invoked to explain the diphoton excess, are\nnot explicitly present in our model and are not predicted to appear in the\nspectrum of TeV scale states. Our minimal setup favors scalar DM of\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\text{TeV})$ mass. A generic expectation in this scenario,\nsuggested by DM considerations, is the appearance of vector bosons at $\\sim$\nfew TeV, corresponding to the gluon and hypercharge Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes\nthat couple to UV boundary states with strengths that are suppressed uniformly\ncompared to their SM values. Our analysis suggests that these KK modes could be\nwithin the reach of the LHC in the coming years.\n", "  We discuss dynamical response theory of driven-dissipative quantum systems\ndescribed by Markovian Master Equations generating semi-groups of maps. In this\nsetting thermal equilibrium states are replaced by non-equilibrium steady\nstates and dissipative perturbations are considered besides the Hamiltonian\nones. We derive explicit expressions for the linear dynamical response\nfunctions for generalized dephasing channels and for Davies thermalizing\ngenerators. We introduce the notion of maximal harmonic response and compute it\nexactly for a single qubit channel. Finally, we analyze linear response near\ndynamical phase transitions in quasi-free open quantum systems. It is found\nthat the effect of the dynamical phase transition shows up in a peak at the\nedge of the spectrum in the imaginary part of the dynamical response function.\n", "  The low temperature physics of parahydrogen (ph2) confined in cylindrical\nchannels of diameter of the order of 1 nm is studied theoretically by Quantum\nMonte Carlo simulations. On varying the attractive strength of the wall of the\ncylindrical pore, as well as its diameter, the equilibrium phase evolves from a\nsingle quasi-1D channel along the axis, to a concentric cylindrical shell. It\nis found that the quasi-1D system retains a strong propensity to\ncrystallization, even though on weakly attractive substrates quantum\nfluctuations reduce somewhat such a tendency compared to the purely 1D system.\nNo evidence of a topologically protected superfluid phase (in the Luttinger\nsense) is observed. Implications on the possible existence of a bulk superfluid\nphase of parahydrogen are discussed\n", "  We update the constraint on the dark matter annihilation cross section by\nusing the recent measurements of the CMB anisotropy by the Planck satellite. We\nfully calculate the cascade of dark matter annihilation products and their\neffects on ionization, heating and excitation of the hydrogen, hence do not\nrely on any assumption on the energy fractions that cause these effects.\n", "  [Abridged] We analyze the evolution of superhorizon-scale magnetic fields\nfrom the end of inflation till today. Whatever is the mechanism responsible for\ntheir generation during inflation, we find that a given magnetic mode with\nwavenumber $k$ evolves, after inflation, according to the values of $k\\eta_e$,\n$n_{\\mathbf{k}}$, and $\\Omega_k$, where $\\eta_e$ is the conformal time at the\nend of inflation, $n_{\\mathbf{k}}$ is the number density spectrum of\ninflation-produced photons, and $\\Omega_k$ is the phase difference between the\ntwo Bogolubov coefficients which characterize the state of that mode at the end\nof inflation. For any realistic inflationary magnetogenesis scenario, we find\nthat $n_{\\mathbf{k}}^{-1} \\ll |k\\eta_e| \\ll 1$, and three evolutionary\nscenarios are possible: ($i$) $|\\Omega_k \\mp \\pi| = \\mathcal{O}(1)$, in which\ncase the evolution of the magnetic spectrum $B_k(\\eta)$ is adiabatic,\n$a^2B_k(\\eta) = \\mbox{const}$, with $a$ being the expansion parameter; ($ii$)\n$|\\Omega_k \\mp \\pi| \\ll |k\\eta_e|$, in which case the evolution is\nsuperadiabatic, $a^2B_k(\\eta) \\propto \\eta$; ($iii$) $|k\\eta_e| \\ll |\\Omega_k\n\\mp \\pi| \\ll 1$ or $|k\\eta_e| \\sim |\\Omega_k \\mp \\pi| \\ll 1$, in which case an\nearly phase of adiabatic evolution is followed, after a time $\\eta_\\star \\sim\n|\\Omega_k \\mp \\pi|/k$, by a superadiabatic evolution. Once a given mode\nreenters the horizon, it remains frozen into the plasma and then evolves\nadiabatically till today. As a corollary of our results, we find that\ninflation-generated magnetic fields evolve adiabatically on all scales and for\nall times in conformal-invariant free Maxwell theory, while they evolve\nsuperadiabatically after inflation on superhorizon scales in the\nnon-conformal-invariant Ratra model. The latter result supports our recent\nclaim that the Ratra model can account for the presence of cosmic magnetic\nfields.\n", "  We present the results of our analysis on V1481 Ori (JW 239), a young SB2 in\nthe Orion Nebula Cluster with a circumbinary disc accreting on the lower-mass\ncomponent. The analysis is based on high-resolution spectroscopic data and\nhigh-quality photometric time series about 20-yr long. Thanks to the\nspectroscopy, we confirm the binary nature of this system consisting of M3 + M4\ncomponents and derive the mass ratio M_B/M_A = 0.54, a variable luminosity\nratio L_B/L_A = 0.68--0.94, and an orbital period P_orb = 4.433d. The\nphotometric data allowed us to measure the rotation periods of the two\ncomponents P_phot = 4.4351d and they are found to be synchronized with the\norbital period. The simultaneous modeling of V-, I-band, and radial velocity\ncurves in the 2005 season suggests that the variability is dominated by one hot\nspot on the secondary component covering at least about 3.5% of the stellar\nsurface and about 420K hotter than the unperturbed photosphere. Such a spot may\noriginate from the material of the circumbinary disc accreting onto the\nsecondary component. We also detect an apparent 6-yr periodic variation in the\nposition of this hot spot, which is inferred from the phase migration of the\nlight curve maximum, which we interpret as due to either the presence of\nsurface differential rotation as large as 0.065%, a value compatible with the\nfully convective components, or to a periodic exchange of angular momentum\nbetween the disc and the star, which implies a minimum magnetic field strength\nof 650G at the stellar surface.\n", "  We address the problem of long-time asymptotics for the solutions of the\nKorteweg-de Vries equation under low regularity assumptions. We consider\nrapidly decreasing initial data admitting only a finite number of moments. For\nthe so-called \"soliton region\", an improved asymptotic estimate is provided, in\ncomparison with the one already present in the literature. Our analysis is\nbased on the dbar steepest descent method proposed by P. Miller and K. T. D.\n-R. McLaughlin.\n", "  In supersymmetric theories, topological defects can have nontrivial behaviors\ndetermined purely by whether or not supersymmetry is restored in the defect\ncore. A well-known example of this is that some supersymmetric cosmic strings\nare automatically superconducting, leading to important cosmological effects\nand constraints. We investigate the impact of nontrivial kinetic interactions,\npresent in a number of particle physics models of interest in cosmology, on the\nrelationship between supersymmetry and supercurrents on strings. We find that\nin some cases it is possible for superconductivity to be disrupted by the extra\ninteractions.\n", "  We address the relation between star formation and AGN activity in a sample\nof 231 nearby ($0.0002<z<0.0358$) early type galaxies by carrying out a\nmulti-wavelength study using archival observations in the UV, IR and radio. Our\nresults indicate that early type galaxies in the current epoch are rarely\npowerful AGNs, with $P<10^{22}\\,WHz^{-1}$ for a majority of the galaxies. Only\nmassive galaxies are capable of hosting powerful radio sources while less\nmassive galaxies are hosts to lower radio power sources. Evidence of ongoing\nstar formation is seen in approximately 7% of the sample. The SFR of these\ngalaxies is less than 0.1 $M_{\\odot}yr^{-1}$. They also tend to be radio faint\n($P<10^{22}\\,WHz^{-1}$). There is a nearly equal fraction of star forming\ngalaxies in radio faint ($P<10^{22}\\,WHz^{-1}$) and radio bright galaxies\n($P\\geq10^{22}\\,WHz^{-1}$) suggesting that both star formation and radio mode\nfeedback are constrained to be very low in our sample. We notice that our\ngalaxy sample and the Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) follow similar trends\nin radio power versus SFR. This may be produced if both radio power and SFR are\nrelated to stellar mass.\n", "  We report on the discovery of a new member of the magnetar class, SGR\nJ1935+2154, and on its timing and spectral properties measured by an extensive\nobservational campaign carried out between July 2014 and March 2015 with\nChandra and XMM-Newton (11 pointings). We discovered the spin period of SGR\nJ1935+2154 through the detection of coherent pulsations at a period of about\n3.24s. The magnetar is slowing-down at a rate of 1.43(1)x10^{-11} s/s and with\na decreasing trend due to a negative second period derivative of\n-3.5(7)x10^{-19} s/s^2. This implies a surface dipolar magnetic field strength\nof about 2.2x10^{14} G, a characteristic age of about 3.6kyr and, a spin-down\nluminosity L_{sd} of about 1.7x10^{34} erg/s. The source spectrum is well\nmodelled by a blackbody with temperature of about 500eV plus a power-law\ncomponent with photon index of about 2. The source showed a moderate long-term\nvariability, with a flux decay of about 25\\% during the first four months since\nits discovery, and a re-brightening of the same amount during the second four\nmonths. The X-ray data were also used to study the source environment. In\nparticular, we discovered a diffuse emission extending on spatial scales from\nabout 1\" up to at least 1' around SGR J1935+2154 both in Chandra and XMM-Newton\ndata. This component is constant in flux (at least within uncertainties) and\nits spectrum is well modelled by a power-law spectrum steeper than that of the\npulsar. Though a scattering halo origin seems to be more probable we cannot\nexclude that part, or all, of the diffuse emission is due to a pulsar wind\nnebula.\n", "  Nova LMC 2009a is confirmed as a Recurrent Nova (RN) from positional\ncoincidence with nova LMC 1971b. The observational data set is one of the most\ncomprehensive for any Galactic or extragalactic RN: optical and near-IR\nphotometry from outburst until over 6 years later; optical spectra for the\nfirst 6 months, and Swift satellite Ultraviolet and X-ray observations from 9\ndays to almost 1 year post-outburst. We find $M_V =\n-8.4\\pm0.8_{\\mathrm{r}}\\pm0.7_{\\mathrm{s}}$ and expansion velocities between\n1000 and 4000 km s$^{-1}$. Coronal line emission before day 9 indicates shocks\nin the ejecta. Strengthening of He II $\\lambda$4686 preceded the emergence of\nthe Super-Soft Source (SSS) in X-rays at $\\sim63-70$ days, which was initially\nvery variable. Periodic modulations, $P=1.2$ days, most probably orbital in\nnature, were evident in the UV and optical from day 43. Subsequently, the SSS\nshows an oscillation with the same period but with a delay of 0.28P. The\nprogenitor system has been identified; the secondary is most likely a sub-giant\nfeeding a luminous accretion disk. Properties of the SSS infer a white dwarf\n(WD) mass $1.1 \\mathrm{M}_\\odot \\lesssim M_{\\rm WD} \\lesssim 1.3\n\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$. If the accretion occurs at constant rate, $\\dot{\\it{M}}_{\\rm\nacc} \\simeq 3.6^{+4.7}_{-2.5} \\times 10^{-7} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is\nneeded, consistent with nova models for an inter-eruption interval of 38 years,\nlow outburst amplitude, progenitor position in the color-magnitude diagram, and\nspectral energy distribution at quiescence. We note striking similarities\nbetween LMC 2009a and the Galactic nova KT Eri, suggesting that KT Eri is a\ncandidate RN.\n", "  Some circumstellar disks, called transitional or hybrid disks, present\ncharacteristics of both protoplanetary disks (significant amount of gas) and\ndebris disks (evolved structures around young main-sequence stars, composed of\nsecond generation dust, from collisions between planetesimals). Therefore, they\nare an ideal astrophysical laboratory to witness the last stages of planet\nformation. The circumstellar disk around HD~141569A was intensively observed\nand resolved in the past from space but also from the ground but the recent\nimplementation of high contrast imaging systems opens new opportunities to\nre-analyze this object. We analyzed Gemini archival data from the Near-Infrared\nCoronagraphic Imager (NICI) obtained in 2011 in the H band, using several\nangular differential imaging techniques (classical ADI, LOCI, KLIP). These\nimages reveal the complex structures of this disk with an unprecedented\nresolution. We also include archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images as an\nindependent dataset to confirm these findings. Using an analysis of the inner\nedge of the disk, we show that the inner disk is almost axisymmetrical. The\nmeasurement of an offset towards the East observed by previous authors is\nlikely due to the fact that the Eastern part of this disk is wider and more\ncomplex in substructure. Our precise re-analysis of the eastern side shows\nseveral structures including a splitting of the disk and a small finger\ndetached from the inner edge on the southeast. Finally, we find that the arc at\n250 AU is unlikely to be a spiral, at least not at the inclination derived from\nthe first ring, but instead could be interpreted as a third belt at a different\ninclination. If the very symmetrical inner disk edge is carved by a companion,\nthe data presented here put additional constraints on its position.\n", "  Lattice regularizations of the bosonic string allow no tachyons. This has\noften been viewed as the reason why these theories have never managed to make\nany contact to standard continuum string theories when the dimension of\nspacetime is larger than two. We study the continuum string theory in large\nspacetime dimensions where simple mean field theory is reliable. By keeping\ncarefully the cutoff we show that precisely the existence of a tachyon makes it\npossible to take a scaling limit which reproduces the lattice-string results.\nWe compare this scaling limit with another scaling limit which reproduces\nstandard continuum-string results. If the people working with lattice\nregularizations of string theories are akin to Gulliver they will view the\nstandard string-world as a Lilliputian world no larger than a few lattice\nspacings.\n", "  We have studied high mass X-ray binary (HMXB) populations within two\nlow-metallicity, starburst galaxies, Haro 11 and VV 114. These galaxies serve\nas analogs to high-redshift (z>2) Lyman break galaxies, and within the larger\nsample of Lyman break analogs (LBAs) are sufficiently nearby (<87 Mpc) to be\nspatially-resolved by Chandra. Previous studies of the X-ray emission in LBAs\nhave found that the 2-10 keV luminosity per star formation rate (SFR) in these\ngalaxies is elevated, potentially because of their low metallicities\n(12+log[O/H]= 8.3-8.4). Theoretically, the progenitors of XRBs forming in lower\nmetallicity environments lose less mass from stellar winds over their\nlifetimes, producing more massive compact objects (i.e., neutron stars and\nblack holes), and thus resulting in more numerous and luminous HMXBs per SFR.\nWe have performed an in-depth study of the only two LBAs that have\nspatially-resolved 2-10 keV emission with Chandra to present the bright end of\nthe X-ray luminosity distribution of HMXBs (L$_X>10^{39}$ erg/s; ultraluminous\nX-ray sources, ULXs) in these low-metallicity galaxies, based on 8 detected\nULXs. Comparing with the star-forming galaxy X-ray luminosity function (XLF)\npresented by Mineo et al. (2012), Haro 11 and VV 114 host ~4 times more\nL$_X>10^{40}$ erg/s sources than expected given their SFRs. We simulate the\neffects of source blending from crowded lower luminosity HMXBs using the\nstar-forming galaxy XLF and then vary the XLF shapes until we reproduce the\nobserved point source luminosity distributions. We find that these LBAs have a\nshallower bright end slope than the standard XLF. If we conservatively assume\nthat the brightest X-ray source from each galaxy is powered by an AGN rather\nthan a HMXB and eliminate these sources from consideration, the luminosity\ndistribution becomes poorly constrained but does appear to be consistent with a\nstandard XLF. [Abridged]\n", "  Active regions (AR) appearing on the surface of the Sun are classified into\n$\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, and $\\delta$ by the rules of the Mount Wilson\nObservatory, California on the basis of their topological complexity. Amongst\nthese, the $\\delta$-sunspots are known to be super-active and produce the most\nX-ray flares. Here, we present results from a simulation of the Sun by\nmimicking the upper layers and the corona, but starting at a more primitive\nstage than any earlier treatment. We find that this initial state consisting of\nonly a thin sub-photospheric magnetic sheet breaks into multiple flux-tubes\nwhich evolve into a colliding-merging system of spots of opposite polarity upon\nsurface emergence, similar to those often seen on the Sun. The simulation goes\non to produce many exotic $\\delta$-sunspot associated phenomena: repeated\nflaring in the range of typical solar flare energy release and ejective helical\nflux ropes with embedded cool-dense plasma filaments resembling solar coronal\nmass ejections.\n", "  We analyze a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic structure and its stability in\nlarge solar active region(AR) 12192, using the 3D coronal magnetic field\nconstructed under a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) approximation. In\nparticular, we focus on the magnetic structure that produced an X3.1-class\nflare which is one of the X-class flares observed in AR 12192. According to our\nanalysis, the AR contains multiple-flux-tube system, {\\it e.g.}, a large flux\ntube, both of whose footpoints are anchored to the large bipole field, under\nwhich other tubes exist close to a polarity inversion line (PIL). These various\nflux tubes of different sizes and shapes coexist there. In particular, the\nlater are embedded along the PIL, which produces a favorable shape for the\ntether-cutting reconnection and is related to the X-class solar flare. We\nfurther found that most of magnetic twists are not released even after the\nflare, which is consistent with the fact that no observational evidence for\nmajor eruptions was found. On the other hand, the upper part of the flux tube\nis beyond a critical decay index, essential for the excitation of torus\ninstability before the flare, even though no coronal mass ejections (CMEs) were\nobserved. We discuss the stability of the complicated flux tube system and\nsuggest the reason for the existence of the stable flux tube. In addition, we\nfurther point out a possibility for tracing the shape of flare ribbons, on the\nbasis of a detailed structural analysis of the NLFFF before a flare.\n", "  The surface energy constraint puts a limit on the smallest fragment\n$s_{surf}$ that can be produced after a collision. Based on analytical\nconsiderations, this mechanism has been recently identified as been potentially\nable to prevent the production of small dust grains in debris discs and cut off\ntheir size distribution at sizes larger than the blow-out size. We numerically\ninvestigate the importance of this effect to find under which conditions it can\nleave a signature in the small-size end of a disc's particle size distribution\n(PSD). An important part of this work is to map out, in a disc at steady-state,\nwhat is the most likely collisional origin for micron-sized grains, in terms of\nthe sizes of their collisional progenitors. We implement, for the first time,\nthe surface energy constraint into a collisional evolution code. We consider a\ndebris disc extending from 50 to 100AU and 2 different stellar types. We also\nconsider two levels of stirring in the disc: dynamically \"hot\" (e=0.075) and\n\"cold\" (e=0.01). For all cases, we derive $s_{surf}$ maps as a function of\ntarget and projectile sizes, $s_t$ and $s_p$, and compare them to equivalent\nmaps for the dust-production rate. We then compute disc-integrated PSDs and\nestimate the imprint of the surface energy constraint. We find that the\n($s_p$,$s_t$) regions of high $s_{surf}$ values do not coincide with those of\nhigh dust production rate. As a consequence, the surface energy constraint has\ngenerally a weak effect on the system's PSD. The maximum $s_{surf}$-induced\ndepletion of $\\mu$m-sized grains is $\\sim 30$% and is obtained for a sun-like\nstar and a dynamically hot case. For the e=0.01 cases, the surface energy\neffect is negligible compared to the massive small grain depletion induced by\nanother mechanism: the natural imbalance between dust production and\ndestruction rates in low-stirring discs identified by Thebault&Wu(2008).\n", "  Emission from carbon monoxide (CO) is ubiquitously used as a tracer of dense\nstar forming molecular clouds. There is, however, growing evidence that a\nsignificant fraction of CO emission originates from diffuse molecular gas.\nQuantifying the contribution of diffuse CO-emitting gas is vital for\nunderstanding the relation between molecular gas and star formation. We examine\nthe Galactic distribution of two CO-emitting gas components, a high column\ndensity component detected in 13CO and 12CO, and a low column density component\ndetected in 12CO, but not in 13CO. The \"diffuse\" and \"dense\" components are\nidentified using a combination of smoothing, masking, and erosion/dilation\nprocedures, making use of three large-scale 12CO and 13CO surveys of the Inner\nand Outer Milky Way. The diffuse component, which globally represents 25\n(1.5x1e8 Mo) of the total molecular gas mass (6.5x1e8 Mo), is more extended\nperpendicular to the Galactic plane. The fraction of diffuse gas increases from\n15% at a galactocentric radius of 3 kpc to 50% at 15 kpc, and increases with\ndecreasing surface density. In the Inner Galaxy, a yet denser component traced\nby CS emission represents 14% of the total molecular gas mass traced by 12CO\nemission. Only 14% of the molecular gas mass traced by 12CO emission is\nidentified as part of molecular clouds in 12CO surveys by cloud identification\nalgorithms. This study indicates that CO emission not only traces star forming\nclouds, but also a significant diffuse molecular ISM component.\n", "  Strong spectral softening has been revealed in the late X-ray afterglows of\nsome gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The scenario of X-ray scattering around\ncircum-burst dusty medium has been supported by previous works due to its\noverall successful prediction of both the temporal and spectral evolution of\nsome X-ray afterglows. To further investigate the observed feature of spectral\nsoftening, we now systematically search the X-ray afterglows detected by X-Ray\nTelescope (XRT) of Swift and collect twelve GRBs with significant late-time\nspectral softening. We find that dust scattering could be the dominant\nradiative mechanism for these X-ray afterglows regarding their temporal and\nspectral features. For some well observed bursts with high-quality data, their\ntime-resolved spectra could be well produced within the scattering scenario by\ntaking into account the X-ray absorption from circum-burst medium. We also find\nthat during spectral softening the power-law index in the high energy end of\nthe spectra does not vary much. The spectral softening is mainly manifested by\nthe spectral peak energy continually moving to the soft end.\n", "  We examine the effect of network heterogeneity on the performance of quantum\nsearch algorithms. To this end, we study quantum search on a tree for the\noracle Hamiltonian formulation employed by continuous-time quantum walks. We\nuse analytical and numerical arguments to show that the exponent of the\nasymptotic running time $\\sim N^{\\beta}$ changes uniformly from $\\beta=0.5$ to\n$\\beta=1$ as the searched-for site is moved from the root of the tree towards\nthe leaves. These results imply that the time complexity of the quantum search\nalgorithm on a balanced tree is closely correlated with certain path-based\ncentrality measures of the searched-for site.\n", "  One of the most powerful gamma-ray bursts, GRB 130427A was swiftly detected\nfrom GeV $\\gamma$-rays to optical wavelengths. In the GeV band, the Large Area\nTelescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope observed the\nhighest-energy photon ever recorded of 95 GeV, and a bright peak in the early\nphase followed by emission temporally extended for more than 20 hours. In the\noptical band, a bright flash with a magnitude of $7.03\\pm 0.03$ in the time\ninterval from 9.31 s to 19.31 s after the trigger was reported by RAPTOR in\nr-band. We study the origin of the GeV $\\gamma$-ray emission, using the\nmultiwavelength observation detected in X-ray and optical bands. The origin of\nthe temporally extended LAT, X-ray and optical flux is naturally interpreted as\nsynchrotron radiation and the 95-GeV photon and the integral flux upper limits\nplaced by the HAWC observatory are consistent with synchrotron self-Compton\nfrom an adiabatic forward shock propagating into the stellar wind of its\nprogenitor. The extreme LAT peak and the bright optical flash are explained\nthrough synchrotron self-Compton and synchrotron emission from the reverse\nshock, respectively, when the ejecta evolves in thick-shell regime and carries\na significant magnetic field.\n", "  Although red giants deplete lithium on their surfaces, some giants are\nLi-rich. Intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars can generate Li\nthrough the Cameron-Fowler conveyor, but the existence of Li-rich, low-mass red\ngiant branch (RGB) stars is puzzling. Globular clusters are the best sites to\nexamine this phenomenon because it is straightforward to determine membership\nin the cluster and to identify the evolutionary state of each star. In 72 hours\nof Keck/DEIMOS exposures in 25 clusters, we found four Li-rich RGB and two\nLi-rich AGB stars. There were 1696 RGB and 125 AGB stars with measurements or\nupper limits consistent with normal abundances of Li. Hence, the frequency of\nLi-richness in globular clusters is (0.2 +/- 0.1)% for the RGB, (1.6 +/- 1.1)%\nfor the AGB, and (0.3 +/- 0.1)% for all giants. Because the Li-rich RGB stars\nare on the lower RGB, Li self-generation mechanisms proposed to occur at the\nluminosity function bump or He core flash cannot explain these four lower RGB\nstars. We propose the following origin for Li enrichment: (1) All luminous\ngiants experience a brief phase of Li enrichment at the He core flash. (2) All\npost-RGB stars with binary companions on the lower RGB will engage in mass\ntransfer. This scenario predicts that 0.1% of lower RGB stars will appear\nLi-rich due to mass transfer from a recently Li-enhanced companion. This\nfrequency is at the lower end of our confidence interval.\n", "  Orion A hosts the nearest massive star factory, thus offering a unique\nopportunity to resolve the processes connected with the formation of both low-\nand high-mass stars. Here we present the most detailed and sensitive\nnear-infrared (NIR) observations of the entire molecular cloud to date. With\nthe unique combination of high image quality, survey coverage, and sensitivity,\nour NIR survey of Orion A aims at establishing a solid empirical foundation for\nfurther studies of this important cloud. In this first paper we present the\nobservations, data reduction, and source catalog generation. To demonstrate the\ndata quality, we present a first application of our catalog to estimate the\nnumber of stars currently forming inside Orion A and to verify the existence of\na more evolved young foreground population. We used the European Southern\nObservatory's (ESO) Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA)\nto survey the entire Orion A molecular cloud in the NIR $J, H$, and $K_S$\nbands, covering a total of $\\sim$18.3 deg$^2$. We implemented all data\nreduction recipes independently of the ESO pipeline. Estimates of the young\npopulations toward Orion A are derived via the $K_S$-band luminosity function.\nOur catalog (799995 sources) increases the source counts compared to the Two\nMicron All Sky Survey by about an order of magnitude. The 90% completeness\nlimits are 20.4, 19.9, and 19.0 mag in $J, H$, and $K_S$, respectively. The\nreduced images have 20% better resolution on average compared to pipeline\nproducts. We find between 2300 and 3000 embedded objects in Orion A and confirm\nthat there is an extended foreground population above the Galactic field, in\nagreement with previous work. The Orion A VISTA catalog represents the most\ndetailed NIR view of the nearest massive star-forming region and provides a\nfundamental basis for future studies of star formation processes toward Orion.\n", "  The classical 'ballistic' overshoot models show some contradictions and are\nnot consistence with numerical simulations and asteroseismic studies.\nAsteroseismic studies imply that overshoot is a weak mixing process. Diffusion\nmodel is suitable to deal with it. The form of diffusion coefficient in a\ndiffusion model is crucial. Because the overshoot mixing is related to the\nconvective heat transport (i.e., entropy mixing), there should be a similarity\nbetween them. A recent overshoot mixing model shows consistence between\ncomposition mixing and entropy mixing in overshoot region. A prerequisite to\napply the model is to know the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy.\nThe dissipation rate can be worked out by solving turbulent convection models\n(TCMs). But it is difficult to apply TCMs because of some numerical problems\nand the enormous time cost. In order to find a convenient way, we have used the\nasymptotical solution and simplified the TCM to be a single linear equation for\nturbulent kinetic energy. This linear model is easy to be implemented in the\ncalculations of stellar evolution with ignorable extra time cost. We have\ntested the linear model in stellar evolution, and have found that the linear\nmodel can well reproduce the turbulent kinetic energy profile of full TCM, as\nwell as the diffusion coefficient, abundance profile and the stellar\nevolutionary tracks. We have also studied the effects of different values of\nthe model parameters and have found that the effect due to the modification of\ntemperature gradient in the overshoot region is slight.\n", "  Metallic antiferromagnets with noncollinear orientation of magnetic moments\nprovide a playground for investigating spin-dependent transport properties by\nanalysis of the anomalous Hall effect. The intermetallic compound Mn5Si3 is an\nintinerant antiferromagnet with collinear and noncollinear magnetic structures\ndue to Mn atoms on two inequivalent lattice sites. Here, magnetotransport\nmeasurements on polycrystalline thin films and a single crystal are reported.\nIn all samples, an additional contribution to the anomalous Hall effect\nattributed to the noncollinear arrangment of magnetic moments is observed.\nFurthermore, an additional magnetic phase between the noncollinear and\ncollinear regimes above a metamagnetic transition is resolved in the single\ncrystal by the anomalous Hall effect.\n", "  Detection of the cosmological neutral hydrogen signal from the Epoch of\nReionization, and estimation of its basic physical parameters, is the principal\nscientific aim of many current low-frequency radio telescopes. Here we describe\nthe Cosmological HI Power Spectrum Estimator (CHIPS), an algorithm developed\nand implemented with data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), to compute\nthe two-dimensional and spherically-averaged power spectrum of brightness\ntemperature fluctuations. The principal motivations for CHIPS are the\napplication of realistic instrumental and foreground models to form the optimal\nestimator, thereby maximising the likelihood of unbiased signal estimation, and\nallowing a full covariant understanding of the outputs. CHIPS employs an\ninverse-covariance weighting of the data through the maximum likelihood\nestimator, thereby allowing use of the full parameter space for signal\nestimation (\"foreground suppression\"). We describe the motivation for the\nalgorithm, implementation, application to real and simulated data, and early\noutputs. Upon application to a set of 3 hours of data, we set a 2$\\sigma$ upper\nlimit on the EoR dimensionless power at $k=0.05$~h.Mpc$^{-1}$ of\n$\\Delta_k^2<7.6\\times{10^4}$~mK$^2$ in the redshift range $z=[6.2-6.6]$,\nconsistent with previous estimates.\n", "  Motion of ferroelectric domain walls greatly contributes to the macroscopic\ndielectric and piezoelectric response of ferroelectric materials. The domain\nwall motion through the ferroelectric material is however hindered by pinning\non crystal defects which substantially reduces these contributions. Here, using\nthermodynamic models based on the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory, we find a\nrelation between microscopic reversible motion of non-ferroelastic 180-degree\ndomain walls interacting with a periodic array of pinning centers and the\nnonlinear macroscopic permittivity. We show, that the reversible motion of\ndomain walls can be split into two basic modes. First, the bending of a domain\nwall between pinning centers, and, second, the uniform movement of domain wall\nplane. We show that their respective contributions may change when the\ndistribution of pinning centers is rearranged during the material aging. We\ndemonstrate that it is possible to indicate which mechanism of the domain wall\nmotion is affected during material aging. This allows to judge whether the\ndefects only homogeneously accumulate at domain walls or prefer to align in\ncertain directions inside the domain wall plane. We suggest that this\ninformation can be obtained using simple macroscopic dielectric measurements\nand a proper analysis of the nonlinear response. Our results may therefore\nserve as a simple and useful tool to obtain details on domain wall pinning in\nan aging process.\n", "  Abell 14 is a poorly studied object despite being considered a born again\nplanetary nebula. We performed a detailed study of its 3D morphology and\nionization structure using the SHAPE and MOCASSIN codes. We found that Abell 14\nis a highly evolved, bipolar nebula with a kinematical age of $\\sim$19,400 yr\nfor a distance of 4 kpc. The high He abundance, and N/O ratio indicate a\nprogenitor of 5 $M_{\\odot}$ that has experienced the third dredge-up and hot\nbottom burning phases. The stellar parameters of the central source reveal a\nstar at a highly evolved stage near to the white dwarf cooling track, being\ninconsistent with the born again scenario. The nebula shows unexpectedly strong\n[N I] $\\lambda 5200$ and [O I] $\\lambda 6300$ emission lines indicating\npossible shock interactions. Abell 14 appears to be a member of a small group\nof highly evolved, extreme Type-I PNe. The members of this group lie at the\nlower-left corner of the PNe regime on the [N II]/H$\\alpha$ vs. [S\nII]/H$\\alpha$ diagnostic diagram, where shock--excited regions/objects are also\nplaced. The low luminosity of their central stars, in conjunction with the\nlarge physical size of the nebulae, result in a very low photo-ionization rate,\nwhich can make any contribution of shock interaction easily perceptible, even\nfor small velocities.\n", "  In this work we study spherical shell dark soliton states in\nthree-dimensional atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. Their symmetry is exploited\nin order to analyze their existence, as well as that of topologically charged\nvariants of the structures, and, importantly, to identify their linear\nstability Bogolyubov-de Gennes spectrum. We compare our effective 1D spherical\nand 2D cylindrical computations with the full 3D numerics. An important\nconclusion is that such spherical shell solitons can be stable sufficiently\nclose to the linear limit of the isotropic condensates considered herein. We\nhave also identified their instabilities leading to the emergence of vortex\nline and vortex ring cages. In addition, we generalize effective particle\npictures of lower dimensional dark solitons and ring dark solitons to the\nspherical shell solitons concerning their equilibrium radius and effective\ndynamics around it. In this case too, we favorably compare the resulting\npredictions such as the shell equilibrium radius, qualitatively and\nquantitatively, with full numerical solutions in 3D.\n", "  Forty transits of the exoplanets HAT-P-12b, HAT-P-13b, HAT-P-16b, HAT-P-23b\nand WASP-10b were recorded with the 0.36m telescope at the Universidad de\nMonterrey Observatory. The images were captured with a standard Johnson-Cousins\nRc and Ic and Sloan z' filters and processed to obtain individual light curves\nof the events. These light curves were successfully combined for each system to\nobtain a resulting one of higher quality, but with a slightly larger time\nsampling rate. A reduction by a factor of about four in per-point scatter was\ntypically achieved, resulting in combined light curves with a scatter of ~1\nmmag. The noise characteristics of the combined light curves were verified by\ncomparing Allan variance plots of the residuals. The combined light curves for\neach system, along with radial velocity measurements from the literature when\navailable, were modeled using a Monte Carlo method to obtain the essential\nparameters that characterize the systems. Our results for all these systems\nconfirm the derived transit parameters (the planet-to-star radius ratio, Rp/R*;\nthe scaled semi-major axis, a/R*; the orbital inclination, i; in some cases the\neccentricity, e; and argument of periastron of the orbit, {\\omega}), validating\nthe methodology. This technique can be used by small college observatories\nequipped with modest-sized telescopes to help characterize known extrasolar\nplanet systems. In some instances, the uncertainties of the essential transit\nparameters are also reduced. For HAT-P-23b, in particular, we derive a planet\nsize 4.5 +- 1.0% smaller. We also derive improved linear periods for each\nsystem, useful for scheduling observations.\n", "  We study how well functions over the boolean hypercube of the form\n$f_k(x)=(|x|-k)(|x|-k-1)$ can be approximated by sums of squares of low-degree\npolynomials, obtaining good bounds for the case of approximation in\n$\\ell_{\\infty}$-norm as well as in $\\ell_1$-norm. We describe three\ncomplexity-theoretic applications: (1) a proof that the recent breakthrough\nlower bound of Lee, Raghavendra, and Steurer on the positive semidefinite\nextension complexity of the correlation and TSP polytopes cannot be improved\nfurther by showing better sum-of-squares degree lower bounds on\n$\\ell_1$-approximation of $f_k$; (2) a proof that Grigoriev's lower bound on\nthe degree of Positivstellensatz refutations for the knapsack problem is\noptimal, answering an open question from his work; (3) bounds on the query\ncomplexity of quantum algorithms whose expected output approximates such\nfunctions.\n", "  In this paper we present an analysis of Kepler K2 mission Campaign 3\nobservations of the irregular Neptune satellite, Nereid. We determined a\nrotation period of P=11.594(+/-)0.017 h and amplitude of dm=0.0328(+/-)00018,\nconfirming previous short rotation periods obtained in ground based\nobservations. The similarities of light curve amplitudes between 2001 and 2015\nshow that Nereid is in a low-amplitude rotation state nowadays and it could\nhave been in a high-amplitude rotation state in the mid 1960's. Another\nhigh-amplitude period is expected in about 30 years. Based on the light curve\namplitudes observed in the last 15 years we could constrain the shape of Nereid\nand obtained a maximum a:c axis ratio of 1.3:1. This excludes the previously\nsuggested very elongated shape of a:c=1.9:1 and clearly shows that Nereid's\nspin axis cannot be in forced precession due to tidal forces. Thermal emission\ndata from the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Herschel Space Observatory\nindicate that Nereid's shape is actually close to the a:c axis ratio limit of\n1.3:1 we obtained, and it has a very rough, highly cratered surface\n", "  A system presenting fractal structure in its thermodynamical functions is\nintroduced, and it is shown that Tsallis statistics is the correct framework\nfor describing the thermodynamical aspects of such fractal. Its Haussdorf\ndimension and its Lipshitz-H\\\"older exponent are determined in terms of the\nentropic index $q$. The connections with the intermittency in experimental data\nis discussed. The thermodynamical aspects of the thermofractal is related to\nthe microscopic interaction of its components through the S-matrix.\n", "  Spitzer observations of SN 1987A have now spanned more than a decade. Since\nday ~4,000, mid-infrared (mid-IR) emission has been dominated by that from\nshock-heated dust in the equatorial ring (ER). From 6,000 to 8,000 days after\nthe explosion, Spitzer observations included broadband photometry at 3.6 - 24\nmicron, and low and moderate resolution spectroscopy at 5 - 35 micron. Here we\npresent later Spitzer observations, through day 10,377, which include only the\nbroadband measurements at 3.6 and 4.5 micron. These data show that the 3.6 and\n4.5 micron brightness has clearly begun to fade after day ~8,500, and no longer\ntracks the X-ray emission as well as it did at earlier epochs. This can be\nexplained by the destruction of the dust in the ER on time scales shorter than\nthe cooling time for the shocked gas. We find that the evolution of the late\ntime IR emission is also similar to the now fading optical emission. We provide\nthe complete record of the IR emission lines, as seen by Spitzer prior to day\n8,000. The past evolution of the gas as seen by the IR emission lines seems\nlargely consistent with the optical emission, although the IR [Fe II] and [Si\nII] lines show different, peculiar velocity structures.\n", "  We present a spectral analysis of Rydberg atoms in strong microwave fields\nusing electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) as an all-optical readout.\nThe measured spectroscopic response enables optical, atom-based electric field\nmeasurements of high-power microwaves. In our experiments, microwaves are\nirradiated into a room-temperature rubidium vapor cell. The microwaves are\ntuned near the two-photon 65D-66D Rydberg transition and reach an electric\nfield strength of 230V/m, about 20% of the microwave ionization threshold of\nthese atoms. A Floquet treatment is used to model the Rydberg level energies\nand their excitation rates. We arrive at an empirical model for the\nfield-strength distribution inside the spectroscopic cell that yields excellent\noverall agreement between the measured and calculated Rydberg EIT-Floquet\nspectra. Using spectral features in the Floquet maps we achieve an absolute\nstrong-field measurement precision of 6%.\n", "  We follow the dynamical evolution of young star-forming regions with a wide\nrange of initial conditions and examine how the radial velocity dispersion,\n$\\sigma$, evolves over time. We compare this velocity dispersion to the\ntheoretically expected value for the velocity dispersion if a region were in\nvirial equilibrium, $\\sigma_{\\rm vir}$ and thus assess the virial state\n($\\sigma / \\sigma_{\\rm vir}$) of these systems. We find that in regions that\nare initially subvirial, or in global virial equilibrium but subvirial on local\nscales, the system relaxes to virial equilibrium within several million years,\nor roughly 25 - 50 crossing times, according to the measured virial ratio.\nHowever, the measured velocity dispersion, $\\sigma$, appears to be a bad\ndiagnostic of the current virial state of these systems as it suggests that\nthey become supervirial when compared to the velocity dispersion estimated from\nthe virial mass, $\\sigma_{\\rm vir}$. We suggest that this discrepancy is caused\nby the fact that the regions are never fully relaxed, and that the early\nnon-equilibrium evolution is imprinted in the one-dimensional velocity\ndispersion at these early epochs. If measured early enough ($<$2 Myr in our\nsimulations, or $\\sim$20 crossing times), the velocity dispersion can be used\nto determine whether a region was highly supervirial at birth without the risk\nof degeneracy. We show that combining $\\sigma$, or the ratio of $\\sigma$ to the\ninterquartile range (IQR) dispersion, with measures of spatial structure,\nplaces stronger constraints on the dynamical history of a region than using the\nvelocity dispersion in isolation.\n", "  We introduce a new class of solutions for Apodized Pupil Lyot Coronagraphs\n(APLC) with segmented aperture telescopes to remove broadband diffracted light\nfrom a star with a contrast level of $10^{10}$. These new coronagraphs provide\na key advance to enabling direct imaging and spectroscopy of Earth twins with\nfuture large space missions. Building on shaped pupil (SP) apodization\noptimizations, our approach enables two-dimensional optimizations of the system\nto address any aperture features such as central obstruction, support\nstructures or segment gaps. We illustrate the technique with a design that\ncould reach $10^{10}$ contrast level at 34\\,mas for a 12\\,m segmented telescope\nover a 10\\% bandpass centered at a wavelength $\\lambda_0=$500\\,nm. These\ndesigns can be optimized specifically for the presence of a resolved star, and\nin our example, for stellar angular size up to 1.1\\,mas. This would allow\nprobing the vicinity of Sun-like stars located beyond 4.4\\,pc, therefore fully\nretiring this concern. If the fraction of stars with Earth-like planets is\n$\\eta_{\\Earth}=0.1$, with 18\\% throughput, assuming a perfect, stable wavefront\nand considering photon noise only, 12.5 exo-Earth candidates could be detected\naround nearby stars with this design and a 12\\,m space telescope during a\nfive-year mission with two years dedicated to exo-Earth detection (one total\nyear of exposure time and another year of overheads). Our new hybrid APLC/SP\nsolutions represent the first numerical solution of a coronagraph based on\nexisting mask technologies and compatible with segmented apertures, and that\ncan provide contrast compatible with detecting and studying Earth-like planets\naround nearby stars. They represent an important step forward towards enabling\nthese science goals with future large space missions.\n", "  Interacting galaxies are known to have higher global rates of star formation\non average than normal galaxies, relative to their stellar masses. Using UV and\nIR photometry combined with new and published H-alpha images, we have compared\nthe star formation rates of ~700 star forming complexes in 46 nearby\ninteracting galaxy pairs with those of regions in 39 normal spiral galaxies.\nThe interacting galaxies have proportionally more regions with high star\nformation rates than the spirals. The most extreme regions in the interacting\nsystems lie at the intersections of spiral/tidal structures, where gas is\nexpected to pile up and trigger star formation. Published Hubble Telescope\nimages show unusually large and luminous star clusters in the highest\nluminosity regions. The star formation rates of the clumps correlate with\nmeasures of the dust attenuation, consistent with the idea that regions with\nmore interstellar gas have more star formation. For the clumps with the highest\nstar formation rates, the apparent dust attenuation is consistent with the\nCalzetti starburst dust attenuation law. This suggests that the high luminosity\nregions are dominated by a central group of young stars surrounded by a shell\nof clumpy interstellar gas. In contrast, the lower luminosity clumps are bright\nin the UV relative to H-alpha, suggesting either a high differential\nattenuation between the ionized gas and the stars, or a post-starburst\npopulation bright in the UV but faded in H-alpha. The fraction of the global\nlight of the galaxies in the clumps is higher on average for the interacting\ngalaxies than for the spirals. Thus the star forming regions in interacting\ngalaxies are more luminous, dustier, or younger on average.\n", "  We report our detailed analysis of a table-top system for the measurement of\nthe weak-force-induced electric dipole moment of a ground state hyperfine\ntransition carried out in an atomic beam geometry. We describe an experimental\nconfiguration of conductors for application of orthogonal r.f. and static\nelectric fields, with cavity enhancement of the r.f. field amplitude, that\nallows confinement of the r.f. field to a region in which the static fields are\nuniform and well-characterized. We carry out detailed numerical simulations of\nthe field modes, and analyze the expected magnitude of statistical and\nsystematic limits to the measurement of this transition amplitude in atomic\ncesium. The combination of an atomic beam with this configuration leads to\nstrong suppression of magnetic dipole contributions to the atomic signal. The\napplication of this technique to the measurement of extremely weak transition\namplitudes in other atomic systems, especially alkali metals, seems very\nfeasible.\n", "  Optical phase curves have become one of the common probes of exoplanetary\natmospheres, but the information they encode has not been fully elucidated.\nBuilding on a diverse body of work, we upgrade the Flexible Modeling System\n(FMS) to include scattering in the two-stream, dual-band approximation and\ngenerate plausible, three-dimensional structures of irradiated atmospheres to\nstudy the radiative effects of aerosols or condensates. In the optical, we\ntreat the scattering of starlight using a generalisation of Beer's law that\nallows for a finite Bond albedo to be prescribed. In the infrared, we implement\nthe two-stream solutions and include scattering via an infrared scattering\nparameter. We present a suite of four-parameter general circulation models for\nKepler-7b and demonstrate that its climatology is expected to be robust to\nvariations in optical and infrared scattering. The westward and eastward shifts\nof the optical and infrared phase curves, respectively, are shown to be robust\noutcomes of the simulations. Assuming micron-sized particles and a simplified\ntreatment of local brightness, we further show that the peak offset of the\noptical phase curve is sensitive to the composition of the aerosols or\ncondensates. However, to within the measurement uncertainties, we cannot\ndistinguish between aerosols made of silicates (enstatite or forsterite), iron,\ncorundum or titanium oxide, based on a comparison to the measured peak offset\n($41^\\circ \\pm 12^\\circ$) of the optical phase curve of Kepler-7b. Measuring\nhigh-precision optical phase curves will provide important constraints on the\natmospheres of cloudy exoplanets and reduce degeneracies in interpreting their\ninfrared spectra.\n", "  We report the discovery of a quasar pair at z=5 separated by 21 arcsec. Both\nobjects were identified as quasar candidates using simple color selection\ntechniques applied to photometric catalogs from the CFHT Legacy Survey\n(CFHTLS). Spectra obtained with the MMT present no discernible offset in\nredshift between the two objects; on the other hand, there are clear\ndifferences in the emission line profiles and in the multiwavelength spectral\nenergy distributions that strongly disfavor the hypothesis that they are\ngravitationally lensed images of a single quasar. Both quasars are surprisingly\nbright given their proximity (a projected separation of ~135 kpc), with i=19.4\nand i=21.4. Previous measurements of the luminosity function demonstrate that\nluminous quasars are extremely rare at z=5; the existence of this pair suggests\nthat quasars have strong small-scale clustering at high redshift. Assuming a\nreal-space correlation function of the form $\\xi(r) \\propto (r/r_0)^{-2}$, this\ndiscovery implies a correlation length $r_0 > 20 h^{-1}$ Mpc, consistent with a\nrapid strengthening of quasar clustering at high redshift as seen in previous\nobservations and predicted by theoretical models where feedback effects are\ninefficient at shutting down black hole growth at high redshift.\n", "  Aims. We present a spectroscopic study of the properties of 64 Balmer break\ngalaxies that show signs of star formation. The studied sample of star-forming\ngalaxies spans a redshift range from 0.094 to 1.475 with stellar masses in the\nrange 10$^{8}-$10$^{12}$ $M_{\\odot}$. The sample also includes eight broad\nemission line galaxies with redshifts between 1.5 $<z<$ 3.0.\n  Methods. We derived star formation rates (SFRs) from emission line\nluminosities and investigated the dependence of the SFR and specific SFR (SSFR)\non the stellar mass and color. Furthermore, we investigated the evolution of\nthese relations with the redshift.\n  Results. We found that the SFR correlates with the stellar mass, our data is\nconsistent with previous results from other authors in that there is a break in\nthe correlation, which reveals the presence of massive galaxies with lower SFR\nvalues (i.e., decreasing star formation). We also note an anticorrelation for\nthe SSFR with the stellar mass. Again in this case, our data is also consistent\nwith a break in the correlation, revealing the presence of massive star-forming\ngalaxies with lower SSFR values, thereby increasing the anticorrelation. These\nresults might suggest a characteristic mass ($M_{0}$) at which the red sequence\ncould mostly be assembled. In addition, at a given stellar mass, high-redshift\ngalaxies have on average higher SFR and SSFR values than local galaxies.\nFinally, we explored whether a similar trend could be observed with redshift in\nthe SSFR$-(u-B)$ color diagram, and we hypothesize that a possible $(u-B)_{0}$\nbreak color may define a characteristic color for the formation of the red\nsequence.\n", "  We present a Hubble Space Telescope STIS spectrum of ASASSN-14li, the first\nrest-frame UV spectrum of a tidal disruption flare (TDF). The underlying\ncontinuum is well fit by a blackbody with $T_{\\mathrm{UV}} = 3.5 \\times 10^{4}$\nK, an order of magnitude smaller than the temperature inferred from X-ray\nspectra (and significantly more precise than previous efforts based on optical\nand near-UV photometry). Super-imposed on this blue continuum, we detect three\nclasses of features: narrow absorption from the Milky Way (probably a\nhigh-velocity cloud), and narrow absorption and broad (FWHM $\\approx 2000$-8000\nkm s$^{-1}$) emission lines at/near the systemic host velocity. The absorption\nlines are blueshifted with respect to the emission lines by $\\Delta v =\n-(250$-400) km s$^{-1}$. Due both to this velocity offset and the lack of\ncommon low-ionization features (Mg II, Fe II), we argue these arise from the\nsame absorbing material responsible for the low-velocity outflow discovered at\nX-ray wavelengths. The broad nuclear emission lines display a remarkable\nabundance pattern: N III], N IV], He II are quite prominent, while the common\nquasar emission lines of C III] and Mg II are weak or entirely absent. Detailed\nmodeling of this spectrum will help elucidate fundamental questions regarding\nthe nature of the emission process(es) at work in TDFs, while future UV\nspectroscopy of ASASSN-14li would help to confirm (or refute) the previously\nproposed connection between TDFs and \"N-rich\" quasars.\n", "  Using artificial neural network (ANN) predictions of total infra-red\nluminosities (LIR), we compare the host galaxy star formation rates (SFRs) of\n~21,000 optically selected active galactic nuclei (AGN), 466 low excitation\nradio galaxies (LERGs) and 721 mid-IR selected AGN. SFR offsets (Delta SFR)\nrelative to a sample of star-forming `main sequence' galaxies (matched in M*, z\nand local environment) are computed for the AGN hosts. Optically selected AGN\nexhibit a wide range of Delta SFR, with a distribution skewed to low SFRs and a\nmedian Delta SFR = -0.06 dex. The LERGs have SFRs that are shifted to even\nlower values with a median Delta SFR = -0.5 dex. In contrast, mid-IR selected\nAGN have, on average, SFRs enhanced by a factor ~1.5. We interpret the\ndifferent distributions of Delta SFR amongst the different AGN classes in the\ncontext of the relative contribution of triggering by galaxy mergers. Whereas\nthe LERGs are predominantly fuelled through low accretion rate secular\nprocesses which are not accompanied by enhancements in SFR, mergers, which can\nsimultaneously boost SFRs, most frequently lead to powerful, obscured AGN.\n", "  The massive Wolf-Rayet type star WR 102c is located near the Quintuplet\nCluster - one of the three massive star clusters in the Galactic Center region.\nPrevious studies indicated that WR 102c may have a dusty circumstellar nebula\nand is among the main ionizing sources of the Sickle Nebula associated with the\nQuintuplet cluster. We obtained observations with the ESO's VLT integral field\nspectrograph SINFONI in the K-band, extracted the stellar spectra, and analyzed\nthem by means of stellar atmosphere models. Our new analysis supersedes the\nresults reported for WR 102c previously. We significantly revise down its\nbolometric luminosity and hydrogen content. We detect four early OB type stars\nclose to WR 102c. These stars have radial velocities similar to that of WR\n102c. We suggest that together with WR 102c these stars belong to a distinct\nstar cluster with a total mass of about 1000 M_sun. We identify a new WR nebula\naround WR 102c in the SINFONI map of the diffuse Br$\\gamma$ emission and in the\nHST's Pa$\\alpha$ images. The Br$\\gamma$ line at different locations is not\nsignificantly broadened and similar to the width of nebular emission elsewhere\nin the H II region around WR 102c. The massive star WR 102c located in the\nGalactic Center region resides in a star cluster containing further early type\nstars. The stellar parameters of WR 102c are typical for hydrogen-free WN6\nstars. We newly identify a nebula surrounding WR 102c that has a morphology\nsimilar to other nebulae around hydrogen-free WR stars, and propose that the\nformation of this nebula is linked to interaction of the fast stellar wind with\nthe matter ejected at previous evolutionary stage of WR 102c.\n", "  Provided the quantum fluctuations are amplified in the presence of a\nclassical gauge field configuration the resulting curvature perturbations\nexhibit a mild statistical anisotropy which should be sufficiently weak not to\nconflict with current observational data. The curvature power spectra induced\nby weakly anisotropic initial states are computed here for the first time when\nthe electric and the magnetic gauge couplings evolve at different rates as it\nhappens, for instance, in the relativistic theory of van der Waals\ninteractions. After recovering the results valid for coincident gauge\ncouplings, the constraints imposed by the isotropy and the homogeneity of the\ninitial states are discussed. The obtained bounds turn out to be more stringent\nthan naively expected and cannot be ignored when discussing the underlying\nmagnetogenesis scenarios.\n", "  We study the clustering of galaxies as a function of spectral type and\nredshift in the range $0.35 < z < 1.1$ using data from the Advanced Large\nHomogeneous Area Medium Band Redshift Astronomical (ALHAMBRA) survey. The data\ncover 2.381 deg$^2$ in 7 fields, after applying a detailed angular selection\nmask, with accurate photometric redshifts [$\\sigma_z < 0.014(1+z)$] down to\n$I_{AB} < 24$. From this catalog we draw five fixed number density,\nredshift-limited bins. We estimate the clustering evolution for two different\nspectral populations selected using the ALHAMBRA-based photometric templates:\nquiescent and star-forming galaxies. For each sample, we measure the real-space\nclustering using the projected correlation function. Our calculations are\nperformed over the range $[0.03,10.0] h^{-1}$ Mpc, allowing us to find a\nsteeper trend for $r_p \\lesssim 0.2 h^{-1}$ Mpc, which is especially clear for\nstar-forming galaxies. Our analysis also shows a clear early differentiation in\nthe clustering properties of both populations: star-forming galaxies show\nweaker clustering with evolution in the correlation length over the analysed\nredshift range, while quiescent galaxies show stronger clustering already at\nhigh redshifts, and no appreciable evolution. We also perform the bias\ncalculation where similar segregation is found, but now it is among the\nquiescent galaxies where a growing evolution with redshift is clearer. These\nfindings clearly corroborate the well known colour-density relation, confirming\nthat quiescent galaxies are mainly located in dark matter halos that are more\nmassive than those typically populated by star-forming galaxies.\n", "  The radio galaxy 3C 273 hosts one of the nearest and best-studied powerful\nquasar jets. Having been imaged repeatedly by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nover the past twenty years, it was chosen for an HST program to measure proper\nmotions in the kiloparsec-scale resolved jets of nearby radio-loud active\ngalaxies. The jet in 3C 273 is highly relativistic on sub-parsec scales, with\napparent proper motions up to 15$c$ observed by VLBI (Lister et al., 2013). In\ncontrast, we find that the kpc-scale knots are compatible with being\nstationary, with a mean speed of $-$0.2$\\pm$0.5$c$ over the whole jet. Assuming\nthe knots are packets of moving plasma, an upper limit of 1c implies a bulk\nLorentz factor $\\Gamma<$2.9. This suggests that the jet has either decelerated\nsignificantly by the time it reaches the kpc scale, or that the knots in the\njet are standing shock features. The second scenario is incompatible with the\ninverse Compton off the Cosmic Microwave Background (IC/CMB) model for the\nX-ray emission of these knots, which requires the knots to be in motion, but\nIC/CMB is also disfavored in the first scenario due to energetic\nconsiderations, in agreement with the recent finding of Meyer & Georganopoulos\n(2014) which ruled out the IC/CMB model for the X-ray emission of 3C 273 via\ngamma-ray upper limits.\n", "  We aimed to detect a supernova (SN) shock breakout (SBO) with observations in\ntime domain. The SBO marks the first escape of radiation from the blast wave\nthat breaks through the photosphere of the star and launches the SN ejecta, and\npeaks in the ultraviolet and soft X-ray bands. The detection of a SBO allows\ndetermining the onset of the explosion with an accuracy from a few hours to a\nfew seconds. Using the XRT and UVOT instruments onboard the Swift satellite we\ncarried out a weekly cadenced, six months lasting monitoring of seven nearby\n(distance <50 Mpc) galaxies, namely NGC1084, NGC2207/IC2163, NGC2770,\nNGC4303/M61, NGC3147, NGC3690, NGC6754. We searched for variable/transient\nsources in the collected data. We found no evidence for a SN SBO event, but we\ndiscovered five objects located within the light of the sample galaxies that\nare variable in the X-ray and/or in the UV. Our sample galaxies are within the\nUniverse volume that will be reached by the forthcoming advanced gravitational\nwaves (GW) detectors (a-LIGO/a-Virgo), thus this work provides an example on\nhow to carry out Swift surveys useful to detect the GW signal from SNe, and to\ndetect counterparts to GW triggers.\n", "  We present a Bayesian approach to combine $Planck$ data and the X-ray\nphysical properties of the intracluster medium in the virialization region of a\nsample of 320 galaxy clusters ($0.056<z<1.24$, $kT>3$ keV) observed with\n$Chandra$. We exploited the high-level of similarity of the emission measure in\nthe cluster outskirts as cosmology proxy. The cosmological parameters are thus\nconstrained assuming that the emission measure profiles at different redshift\nare weakly self-similar, that is their shape is universal, explicitly allowing\nfor temperature and redshift dependence of the gas fraction. This cosmological\ntest, in combination with $Planck$+SNIa data, allows us to put a tight\nconstraint on the dark energy models. For a constant-$w$ model, we have\n$w=-1.010\\pm0.030$ and $\\Omega_m=0.311\\pm0.014$, while for a time-evolving\nequation of state of dark energy $w(z)$ we have $\\Omega_m=0.308\\pm 0.017$,\n$w_0=-0.993\\pm0.046$ and $w_a=-0.123\\pm0.400$. Constraints on the cosmology are\nfurther improved by adding priors on the gas fraction evolution from\nhydrodynamic simulations. Current data favour the cosmological constant with\n$w\\equiv-1$, with no evidence for dynamic dark energy. We checked that our\nmethod is robust towards different sources of systematics, including background\nmodelling, outlier measurements, selection effects, inhomogeneities of the gas\ndistribution and cosmic filaments. We also provided for the first time\nconstraints on which definition of cluster boundary radius is more tenable,\nnamely based on a fixed overdensity with respect to the critical density of the\nUniverse. This novel cosmological test has the capacity to provide a\ngenerational leap forward in our understanding of the equation of state of dark\nenergy.\n", "  We introduce an heterogeneous nonlinear $q$-voter model with zealots and two\ntypes of susceptible voters, and study its non-equilibrium properties when the\npopulation is finite and well mixed. In this two-opinion model, each individual\nsupports one of two parties and is either a zealot or a susceptible voter of\ntype $q_1$ or $q_2$. While here zealots never change their opinion, a\n$q_i$-susceptible voter ($i=1,2$) consults a group of $q_i$ neighbors at each\ntime step, and adopts their opinion if all group members agree. We show that\nthis model violates the detailed balance whenever $q_1 \\neq q_2$ and has\nsurprisingly rich properties. Here, we focus on the characterization of the\nmodel's non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) in terms of its probability\ndistribution and currents in the distinct regimes of low and high density of\nzealotry. We unveil the NESS properties in each of these phases by computing\nthe opinion distribution and the circulation of probability currents, as well\nas the two-point correlation functions at unequal times (formally related to a\n\"probability angular momentum\"). Our analytical calculations obtained in the\nrealm of a linear Gaussian approximation are compared with numerical results.\n", "  We present new ALMA observations of CO $J$=2$-$1 line emission from the DQ\nTau circumbinary disk. These data are used to tomographically reconstruct the\nKeplerian disk velocity field in a forward-modeling inference framework, and\nthereby provide a dynamical constraint on the mass of the DQ Tau binary of\n$M_\\ast = 1.27_{-0.27}^{+0.46} \\,M_\\odot$. Those results are compared with an\nupdated and improved orbital solution for this double-lined system based on\nlong-term monitoring of its stellar radial velocities. Both of these\nindependent dynamical constraints on the binary mass are in excellent\nagreement: taken together, they demonstrate that the DQ Tau system mass is\n$1.21\\pm0.26\\,M_\\odot$ and that the disk and binary orbital planes are aligned\nwithin $3^\\circ$ (at 3$\\sigma$ confidence). The predictions of various\ntheoretical models for pre-main sequence stellar evolution are also consistent\nwith these masses, although more detailed comparisons are difficult due to\nlingering uncertainties in the photospheric properties of the individual\ncomponents. DQ Tau is the third nearly equal-mass double-lined spectroscopic\nbinary with a circumbinary disk that has been dynamically \"weighed\" with these\ntwo independent techniques: all show consistent results, validating the overall\naccuracy of the disk-based approach and demonstrating that it can be robustly\napplied to large samples of young, single stars as ALMA ramps up to operations\nat full capacity.\n", "  We propose a way to distinguish compact stellar object, whose size is very\nclose to its Schwarzschild radius, from the collapsing stars. Namely, we show\nthat {\\it massive} fields in the vicinity of a very compact stellar object have\ndiscrete energy levels. (These levels are different from the standard\nnon-relativistic ones present in Coulomb type of potentials and from the\nquasinormal modes.) At the same time we show that there are no such discrete\nlevels for massive fields in the vicinity of a collapsing star.\n", "  As part of our study of the old (~2.5 Gyr) open cluster NGC 6819 in the\nKepler field, we present photometric (Kepler and ground-based BVRcIc) and\nspectroscopic observations of the detached eclipsing binary WOCS 24009 (Auner\n665; KIC 5023948) with a short orbital period of 3.6 days. WOCS 24009 is a\ntriple-lined system, and we verify that the brightest star is physically\norbiting the eclipsing binary using radial velocities and eclipse timing\nvariations. The eclipsing binary components have masses M_B =1.090+/-0.010 Msun\nand M_C =1.075+/-0.013 Msun, and radii R_B =1.095+/-0.007 Rsun and R_C\n=1.057+/-0.008 Rsun. The bright non-eclipsing star resides at the cluster\nturnoff, and ultimately its mass will directly constrain the turnoff mass: our\npreliminary determination is M_A =1.251+/-0.057 Msun. A careful examination of\nthe light curves indicates that the fainter star in the eclipsing binary\nundergoes a very brief period of total eclipse, which enables us to precisely\ndecompose the light of the three stars and place them in the color-magnitude\ndiagram.\n  We also present improved analysis of two previously discussed detached\neclipsing stars in NGC 6819 (WOCS 40007 and WOCS 23009) en route to a combined\ndetermination of the cluster's distance modulus (m-M)_V=12.38+/-0.04. Because\nthis paper significantly increases the number of measured stars in the cluster,\nwe can better constrain the age of the color-magnitude diagram to be\n2.21+/-0.10+/-0.20 Gyr. Additionally, using all measured eclipsing binary star\nmasses and radii, we constrain the age to 2.38+/-0.05+/-0.22 Gyr. The quoted\nuncertainties are estimates of measurement and systematic uncertainties (due to\nmodel physics differences and metal content), respectively.\n", "  Heterodyne receivers register the sky signal on either a circular\npolarization basis (where it is split into left-hand and right-hand circular\npolarization) or a linear polarization basis (where it is split into horizontal\nand vertical linear polarization). We study the problem of interferometric\nobservations performed with telescopes that observe on different polarization\nbases, hence producing visibilities that we call \"mixed basis\" (i.e., linear in\none telescope and circular in the other). We present novel algorithms for the\nproper calibration and treatment of such interferometric observations and test\nour algorithms with both simulations and real data. The use of our algorithms\nwill be important for the optimum calibration of forthcoming observations with\nthe Atacama Large mm/submm Array (ALMA) in very-long-baseline interferometry\n(VLBI) mode. Our algorithms will also allow us to optimally calibrate future\nVLBI observations at very high data rates (i.e., wide bandwidths), where\nlinear-polarization feeds will be preferable at some stations, to overcome the\npolarimetric limitations due to the use of quarter-wave plates.\n", "  The newly discovered Ising-type ferromagnet CeRu$_2$Al$_2$B exhibits an\nadditional phase transition at $T_\\textrm{N}$ = 14.2 K before entering the\nferromagnetic ground state at $T_\\textrm{C}$ = 12.8 K. We clarify the nature of\nthis transition through high resolution neutron diffraction measurements. The\ndata reveal the presence of a longitudinal incommensurate spin-density wave\n(SDW) in the temperature range of $T_\\textrm{C}<T<T_\\textrm{N}$. The\npropagation vector ${\\bf q} \\sim (0,0,0.148)$ is nearly temperature independent\nin this region and discontinuously locks into ${\\bf q} = 0$ at $T_\\textrm{C}$.\nMean-field calculations of an effective Ising model indicate that the modulated\nSDW phase is stabilized by a strong competition between ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic exchange interactions. This makes CeRu$_2$Al$_2$B a\nparticularly attractive model system to study the global phase diagram of\nferromagnetic heavy-fermion metals under influence of magnetic frustration.\n", "  We report on an effort to extract and monitor interstellar scintillation\nparameters in regular timing observations collected for the NANOGrav pulsar\ntiming array. Scattering delays are measured by creating dynamic spectra for\neach pulsar and observing epoch of wide-band observations centered near 1500\nMHz and carried out at the Green Bank Telescope and the Arecibo Observatory.\nThe ~800-MHz wide frequency bands imply dramatic changes in scintillation\nbandwidth across the bandpass, and a stretching routine has been included to\naccount for this scaling. For most of the 10 pulsars for which the scaling has\nbeen measured, the bandwidths scale with frequency less steeply than expected\nfor a Kolmogorov medium. We find estimated scattering delay values that vary\nwith time by up to an order of magnitude. The mean measured scattering delays\nare similar to previously published values and slightly higher than predicted\nby interstellar medium models. We investigate the possibility of increasing the\ntiming precision by mitigating timing errors introduced by the scattering\ndelays. For most of the pulsars, the uncertainty in the time of arrival of a\nsingle timing point is much larger than the maximum variation of the scattering\ndelay, suggesting that diffractive scintillation remains only a negligible part\nof their noise budget.\n", "  We present Herschel/HIFI observations (WISH KP) of 14 water lines in a small\nsample of galactic massive protostellar objects: NGC6334I(N), DR21(OH),\nIRAS16272-4837, and IRAS05358+3543. We analyze the gas dynamics from the line\nprofiles. Through modeling of the observations using RATRAN, we estimate\noutflow, infall, turbulent velocities, molecular abundances, and investigate\nany correlation with the evolutionary status of each source. The molecular line\nprofiles exhibit a broad component coming from the shocks along the cavity\nwalls associated with the protostars, and an infalling (or expansion for\nIRAS05358+3543) and passively heated envelope component, with highly supersonic\nturbulence likely increasing with the distance from the center. Accretion rates\nbetween 6.3 10^{-5} and 5.6 10^{-4} \\msun yr^{-1} are derived from the infall\nobserved in three of our sources. The outer water abundance is estimated to be\nat the typical value of a few 10^{-8} while the inner abundance varies from 1.7\n10^{-6} to 1.4 10^{-4} with respect to H2 depending on the source. We confirm\nthat regions of massive star formation are highly turbulent and that the\nturbulence likely increases in the envelope with the distance to the star. The\ninner abundances are lower than the expected 10^{-4} perhaps because our\nobserved lines do not probe deep enough into the inner envelope, or because\nphotodissociation through protostellar UV photons is more efficient than\nexpected. We show that the higher the infall/expansion velocity in the\nprotostellar envelope, the higher is the inner abundance, maybe indicating that\nlarger infall/expansion velocities generate shocks that will sputter water from\nthe ice mantles of dust grains in the inner region. High-velocity water must be\nformed in the gas-phase from shocked material.\n", "  We simulate the tidal disruption of a collisionless N-body globular star\ncluster in a total of 300 different orbits selected to have galactocentric\nradii between 10 and 30 kpc in four dark matter halos: (a) a spherical halo\nwith no subhalos, (b) a spherical halo with subhalos, (c) a realistic halo with\nno subhalos, and (d) a realistic halo with subhalos. This allows us to isolate\nand study how the halo's (lack of) dynamical symmetry and substructures affect\nthe dispersal of tidal debris. The realistic halos are constructed from the\nsnapshot of the Via Lactea II simulation at redshift zero. We find that the\noverall halo's lack of dynamical symmetry disperses tidal debris to make the\nstreams fluffier, consistent with previous studies of tidal debris of dwarf\ngalaxies in larger orbits than ours in this study. On the other hand, subhalos\nin realistic potentials can locally enhance the densities along streams, making\nstreams denser than their counterparts in smooth potentials. We show that many\nlong and thin streams can survive in a realistic and lumpy halo for a Hubble\ntime. This suggests that upcoming stellar surveys will likely uncover more thin\nstreams which may contain density gaps that have been shown to be promising\nprobes for dark matter substructures.\n", "  This paper describes a new publicly available codebase for modelling galaxy\nformation in a cosmological context, the \"Semi-Analytic Galaxy Evolution\"\nmodel, or SAGE for short. SAGE is a significant update to that used in Croton\net al. (2006) and has been rebuilt to be modular and customisable. The model\nwill run on any N-body simulation whose trees are organised in a supported\nformat and contain a minimum set of basic halo properties. In this work we\npresent the baryonic prescriptions implemented in SAGE to describe the\nformation and evolution of galaxies, and their calibration for three N-body\nsimulations: Millennium, Bolshoi, and GiggleZ. Updated physics include: gas\naccretion, ejection due to feedback, and reincorporation via the galactic\nfountain; a new gas cooling--radio mode active galactic nucleus (AGN) heating\ncycle; AGN feedback in the quasar mode; a new treatment of gas in satellite\ngalaxies; and galaxy mergers, disruption, and the build-up of intra-cluster\nstars. Throughout, we show the results of a common default parameterization on\neach simulation, with a focus on the local galaxy population.\n", "  We obtained using MegaCam at the CFHT a deep narrow band Halpha+[NII] wide\nfield image of NGC 4569, the brightest late-type galaxy in the Virgo cluster.\nThe image reveals the presence of long tails of diffuse ionised gas without any\nassociated stellar component extending from the disc of the galaxy up to ~ 80\nkpc (projected distance) with a typical surface brightness of a few 10^-18 erg\ns-1 cm-2 arcsec-2. These features provide direct evidence that NGC 4569 is\nundergoing a ram presure stripping event. The image also shows a prominent 8\nkpc spur of ionised gas associated to the nucleus that spectroscopic data\nidentify as an outflow. With some assumptions on the 3D distribution of the\ngas, we use the Halpha surface brightness of these extended low surface\nbrightness features to derive the density and the mass of the gas stripped\nduring the interaction of the galaxy with the ICM. The comparison with ad-hoc\nchemo-spectrophotometric models of galaxy evolution indicates that the mass of\nthe Halpha emitting gas in the tail is comparable to that of the cold phase\nstripped from the disc, suggesting that the gas is ionised within the tail\nduring the stripping process. The lack of star forming regions suggests that\nmechanisms other than photoionisation are responsible for the excitation of the\ngas (shocks, heat conduction, magneto hydrodynamic waves). This analysis\nindicates that ram pressure stripping is efficient in massive (M_star ~ 10^10.5\nMo) galaxies located in intermediate mass (~ 10^14 Mo) clusters under\nformation. It also shows that the mass of gas expelled by the nuclear outflow\nis ~ 1 % than that removed during the ram pressure stripping event. All\ntogether these results indicate that ram pressure stripping, rather than\nstarvation through nuclear feedback, can be the dominant mechanism responsible\nfor the quenching of the star formation activity of galaxies in high density\nenvironments.\n", "  We image with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity disk features\nthat could be potential signs of planet-disk interaction. Two companion\ncandidates have been claimed in the disk around the young Herbig Ae/Be star\nHD100546. Thus, this object serves as an excellent target for our investigation\nof the natal environment of giant planets. We exploit the power of extreme\nadaptive optics operating in conjunction with the new high-contrast imager\nSPHERE to image HD100546 in scattered light. We obtain the first polarized\nlight observations of this source in the visible (with resolution as fine as 2\nAU) and new H and K band total intensity images that we analyze with the\nPynpoint package. The disk shows a complex azimuthal morphology, where multiple\nscattering of photons most likely plays an important role. High brightness\ncontrasts and arm-like structures are ubiquitous in the disk. A double-wing\nstructure (partly due to ADI processing) resembles a morphology newly observed\nin inclined disks. Given the cavity size in the visible (11 AU), the CO\nemission associated to the planet candidate 'c' might arise from within the\ncircumstellar disk. We find an extended emission in the K band at the expected\nlocation of 'b'. The surrounding large-scale region is the brightest in\nscattered light. There is no sign of any disk gap associated to 'b'.\n", "  We study the ionization structure of galactic outflows in 37 nearby, star\nforming galaxies with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space\nTelescope. We use the O I, Si II, Si III, and Si IV ultraviolet absorption\nlines to characterize the different ionization states of outflowing gas. We\nmeasure the equivalent widths, line widths, and outflow velocities of the four\ntransitions, and find shallow scaling relations between them and galactic\nstellar mass and star formation rate. Regardless of the ionization potential,\nlines of similar strength have similar velocities and line widths, indicating\nthat the four transitions can be modeled as a co-moving phase. The Si\nequivalent width ratios (e.g. Si IV/Si II) have low dispersion, and little\nvariation with stellar mass; while ratios with O I and Si vary by a factor of 2\nfor a given stellar mass. Photo-ionization models reproduce these equivalent\nwidth ratios, while shock models under predict the relative amount of high\nionization gas. The photo-ionization models constrain the ionization parameter\n(U) between -2.25 < log(U) < -1.5, and require that the outflow metallicities\nare greater than 0.5 Z$_\\odot$. We derive ionization fractions for the\ntransitions, and show that the range of ionization parameters and stellar\nmetallicities leads to a factor of 1.15-10 variation in the ionization\nfractions. Historically, mass outflow rates are calculated by converting a\ncolumn density measurement from a single metal ion into a total Hydrogen column\ndensity using an ionization fraction, thus mass outflow rates are sensitive to\nthe assumed ionization structure of the outflow.\n", "  The ground state of the quantum spin ice candidate magnet Yb2Ti2O7 is known\nto be sensitive to weak disorder at the 1 percent level which occurs in single\ncrystals grown from the melt. Powders produced by solid state synthesis tend to\nbe stoichiometric and display large and sharp heat capacity anomalies at\nrelatively high temperatures, with Tc about 0.26 K. We have carried out neutron\nelastic and inelastic measurements on well characterized and equilibrated\nstoichiometric powder samples of Yb2Ti2O7 which show resolution-limited Bragg\npeaks to appear at low temperatures, but whose onset correlates with\ntemperatures much higher than Tc. The corresponding magnetic structure is best\ndescribed as an ice-like splayed ferromagnet. The spin dynamics in Yb2Ti2O7 are\nshown to be gapless on an energy scale smaller than 0.09 meV at all\ntemperatures, and organized into a continuum of scattering with vestiges of\nhighly overdamped ferromagnetic spin waves present. These excitations differ\ngreatly from conventional spin waves predicted for Yb2Ti2O7 s mean field\nordered state, but appear robust to weak disorder as they are largely\nconsistent with those displayed by non stoichiometric crushed single crystals\nand single crystals, as well as by powder samples of Yb2Ti2O7 s sister quantum\nmagnet Yb2Sn2O7.\n", "  We report spectroscopic observations of the resonance lines of singly ionized\n$^{7}$Be in the blue-shifted absorption line systems found in the post-outburst\nspectra of two classical novae -- V5668 Sgr (Nova Sagittarii 2015 No.2) and\nV2944 Oph (Nova Ophiuchi 2015). The unstable isotope, $^{7}$Be, should has been\ncreated during the thermonuclear runaway (TNR) of these novae and decays to\nform $^{7}$Li within a short period (a half-life of 53.22 days). Confirmations\nof $^{7}$Be are the second and the third ones following the first case found in\nV339 Del by Tajitsu et al. (2015). The blue-shifted absorption line systems in\nboth novae are clearly divided into two velocity components, both of which\ncontain $^{7}$Be. This means that the absorbing gases in both velocity\ncomponents consist of products of TNR. We estimate amounts of $^{7}$Be produced\nduring outbursts of both novae and conclude that significant $^{7}$Li should\nhave been created. These findings strongly suggest that the explosive\nproduction of $^{7}$Li via the reaction $^{3}$He($\\alpha$,$\\gamma$)$^{7}$Be and\nsubsequent decay to $^{7}$Li occurs frequently among classical novae and\ncontributes to the process of the Galactic Li enrichment.\n", "  A theoretical framework is developed to estimate the optimal binning of X-ray\nspectra. We derived expressions for the optimal bin size for model spectra as\nwell as for observed data using different levels of sophistication. It is shown\nthat by taking into account both the number of photons in a given spectral\nmodel bin and their average energy over the bin size, the number of model\nenergy bins and the size of the response matrix can be reduced by a factor of\n$10-100$. The response matrix should then contain the response at the bin\ncentre as well as its derivative with respect to the incoming photon energy. We\nprovide practical guidelines for how to construct optimal energy grids as well\nas how to structure the response matrix. A few examples are presented to\nillustrate the present methods.\n", "  We have investigated structure formation in the $\\gamma$ gravity $f(R)$ model\nwith {\\it N}-body simulations. The $\\gamma$ gravity model is a proposal which,\nunlike other viable $f(R)$ models, not only changes the gravitational dynamics,\nbut can in principle also have signatures at the background level that are\ndifferent from those obtained in $\\Lambda$CDM (Cosmological constant, Cold Dark\nMatter). The aim of this paper is to study the nonlinear regime of the model in\nthe case where, at late times, the background differs from $\\Lambda$CDM. We\nquantify the signatures produced on the power spectrum, the halo mass function,\nand the density and velocity profiles. To appreciate the features of the model,\nwe have compared it to $\\Lambda$CDM and the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ models. For the\nconsidered set of parameters we find that the screening mechanism is\nineffective, which gives rise to deviations in the halo mass function that\ndisagree with observations. This does not rule out the model per se, but\nrequires choices of parameters such that $|f_{R0}|$ is much smaller, which\nwould imply that its cosmic expansion history cannot be distinguished from\n$\\Lambda$CDM at the background level.\n", "  Protoplanetary disks, interstellar clouds, and active galactic nuclei,\ncontain X-ray dominated regions. X-rays interact with the dust and gas present\nin such environments. While a few laboratory X-ray irradiation experiments have\nbeen performed on ices, X-ray irradiation experiments on bare cosmic dust\nanalogs have been scarce up to now. Our goal is to study the effects of hard\nX-rays on cosmic dust analogs via in-situ X-ray diffraction. By using a hard\nX-ray synchrotron nanobeam, we seek to simulate cumulative X-ray exposure on\ndust grains during their lifetime in these astrophysical environments, and\nprovide an upper limit on the effect of hard X-rays on dust grain structure.\n  We prepared enstatite nanograins, analogs to cosmic silicates, via the\nmelting-quenching technique. These amorphous grains were then annealed to\nobtain polycrystalline grains. These were characterized via scanning electron\nmicroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy before\nirradiation. Powder samples were prepared in X-ray transparent substrates and\nwere irradiated with hard X-rays nanobeams (29.4 keV) provided by beamline\nID16B of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. X-ray diffraction images\nwere recorded in transmission mode. We detected the amorphization of\npolycrystalline silicates embedded in an organic matrix after an accumulated\nX-ray exposure of 6.4 x 10$^{27}$ eV cm$^{-2}$. Pure crystalline silicate\ngrains (without resin) did not exhibit amorphization. None of the amorphous\nsilicate samples (pure and embedded in resin) underwent crystallization. We\nanalyzed the evolution of the polycrystalline sample embedded in an organic\nmatrix as a function of X-ray exposure. Loss of diffraction peak intensity,\npeak broadening, and the disappearance of discrete spots and arcs, revealed the\namorphization of the resin embedded (originally polycrystalline) silicate\nsample.\n", "  Interferometric observations of microlensing events have the potential to\nprovide unique constraints on the physical properties of the lensing systems.\nIn this work, we first present a formalism that closely combines\ninterferometric and microlensing observable quantities, which lead us to define\nan original microlensing (u,v) plane. We run simulations of long-baseline\ninterferometric observations and photometric light curves to decide which\nobservational strategy is required to obtain a precise measurement on vector\nEinstein radius. We finally perform a detailed analysis of the expected number\nof targets in the light of new microlensing surveys (2011+) which currently\ndeliver 2000 alerts/year. We find that a few events are already at reach of\nlong baseline interferometers (CHARA, VLTI), and a rate of about 6 events/year\nis expected with a limiting magnitude of K~10. This number would increase by an\norder of magnitude by raising it to K~11. We thus expect that a new route for\ncharacterizing microlensing events will be opened by the upcoming generations\nof interferometers.\n", "  Globular clusters associated with the Galactic bulge are important tracers of\nstellar populations in the inner Galaxy. High resolution analysis of stars in\nthese clusters allows us to characterize them in terms of kinematics,\nmetallicity, and individual abundances, and to compare these fingerprints with\nthose characterizing field populations. We present iron and element ratios for\nseven red giant stars in the globular cluster NGC~6723, based on high\nresolution spectroscopy. High resolution spectra ($R\\sim48~000$) of seven K\ngiants belonging to NGC 6723 were obtained with the FEROS spectrograph at the\nMPG/ESO 2.2m telescope. Photospheric parameters were derived from $\\sim130$ FeI\nand FeII transitions. Abundance ratios were obtained from line-to-line spectrum\nsynthesis calculations on clean selected features. An intermediate metallicity\nof [Fe/H]$=-0.98\\pm0.08$ dex and a heliocentric radial velocity of\n$v_{hel}=-96.6\\pm1.3~km s^{-1}$ were found for NGC 6723. Alpha-element\nabundances present enhancements of $[O/Fe]=0.29\\pm0.18$ dex,\n$[Mg/Fe]=0.23\\pm0.10$ dex, $[Si/Fe]=0.36\\pm0.05$ dex, and $[Ca/Fe]=0.30\\pm0.07$\ndex. Similar overabundance is found for the iron-peak Ti with\n$[Ti/Fe]=0.24\\pm0.09$ dex. Odd-Z elements Na and Al present abundances of\n$[Na/Fe]=0.00\\pm0.21$ dex and $[Al/Fe]=0.31\\pm0.21$ dex, respectively. Finally,\nthe s-element Ba is also enhanced by $[Ba/Fe]=0.22\\pm0.21$ dex. The enhancement\nlevels of NGC 6723 are comparable to those of other metal-intermediate bulge\nglobular clusters. In turn, these enhancement levels are compatible with the\nabundance profiles displayed by bulge field stars at that metallicity. This\nhints at a possible similar chemical evolution with globular clusters and the\nmetal-poor of the bulge going through an early prompt chemical enrichment.\n", "  Recently Pasetto et al. have proposed a new method to derive a convection\ntheory appropriate for the implementation in stellar evolution codes. Their\napproach is based on the simple physical picture of spherical bubbles moving\nwithin a potential flow in dynamically unstable regions, and a detailed\ncomputation of the bubble dynamics. Based on this approach the authors derive a\nnew theory of convection which is claimed to be parameter free, non-local and\ntime-dependent. This is a very strong claim, as such a theory is the holy grail\nof stellar physics.\n  Unfortunately we have identified several distinct problems in the derivation\nwhich ultimately render their theory inapplicable to any physical regime. In\naddition we show that the framework of spherical bubbles in potential flows is\nunable to capture the essence of stellar convection, even when equations are\nderived correctly.\n", "  We consider two parallel layers of dipolar ultracold Fermi gases at different\ntemperatures and calculate the heat transfer between them. The effective\ninteractions describing screening and correlation effects between the dipoles\nin a single layer are modeled within the Euler-Lagrange Fermi-hypernetted chain\napproximation. The random-phase approximation is used for the interactions\nacross the layers. We investigate the amount of transferred power between the\nlayers as a function of the temperature difference. Energy transfer arises due\nto the long-range dipole-dipole interactions. A simple thermal model is\nestablished to investigate the feasibility of using the contactless sympathetic\ncooling of the ultracold polar atoms/molecules. Our calculations indicate that\ndipolar heat transfer is effective for typical polar molecule experiments and\nmay be utilized as a cooling process.\n", "  The active galactic nuclei X-ray luminosity function traces actively\naccreting supermassive black holes and is essential for the study of the\nproperties of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) population, black hole\nevolution, and galaxy-black hole coevolution. Up to now, the AGN luminosity\nfunction has been estimated several times in soft (0.5-2 keV) and hard X-rays\n(2-10 keV). AGN selection in these energy ranges often suffers from\nidentification and redshift incompleteness and, at the same time, photoelectric\nabsorption can obscure a significant amount of the X-ray radiation. We estimate\nthe evolution of the luminosity function in the 5-10 keV band, where we\neffectively avoid the absorbed part of the spectrum, rendering absorption\ncorrections unnecessary up to NH=10^23 cm^-2. Our dataset is a compilation of\nsix wide, and deep fields: MAXI, HBSS, XMM-COSMOS, Lockman Hole, XMM-CDFS,\nAEGIS-XD, Chandra-COSMOS, and Chandra-CDFS. This extensive sample of ~1110 AGN\n(0.01<z<4.0, 41<log L_x<46) is 98% redshift complete with 68% spectroscopic\nredshifts. We use Bayesian analysis to select the best parametric model from\nsimple pure luminosity and pure density evolution to more complicated\nluminosity and density evolution and luminosity-dependent density evolution. We\nestimate the model parameters that describe best our dataset separately for\neach survey and for the combined sample. We show that, according to Bayesian\nmodel selection, the preferred model for our dataset is the\nluminosity-dependent density evolution (LDDE). Our estimation of the AGN\nluminosity function does not require any assumption on the AGN absorption and\nis in good agreement with previous works in the 2-10 keV energy band based on\nX-ray hardness ratios to model the absorption in AGN up to redshift three. Our\nsample does not show evidence of a rapid decline of the AGN luminosity function\nup to redshift four. [abridged]\n", "  Thanks to deep UV observations with GALEX and Swift, diffuse UV haloes have\nrecently been discovered around galaxies. Based on UV-optical colours, it has\nbeen advocated that the UV haloes around spiral galaxies are due to UV\nradiation emitted from the disc and scattered off dust grains at high\nlatitudes. Detailed UV radiative transfer models that take into account\nscattering and absorption can explain the morphology of the UV haloes, and they\nrequire the presence of an additional thick dust disc next the to traditional\nthin disc for half of the galaxies in their sample. We test whether such an\nadditional thick dust disc agrees with the observed infrared emission in NGC\n3628, an edge-on galaxy with a clear signature of a thick dust disc. We extend\nthe far-ultraviolet radiative transfer models to full-scale panchromatic\nmodels. Our model, which contains no fine-tuning, can almost perfectly\nreproduce the observed spectral energy distribution from UV to mm wavelengths.\nThese results corroborate the interpretation of the extended UV emission in NGC\n3628 as scattering off dust grains, and hence of the presence of a substantial\namount of diffuse extra-planar dust. A significant caveat, however, is the\ngeometrical simplicity and non-uniqueness of our model: other models with a\ndifferent geometrical setting could lead to a similar spectral energy\ndistribution. More detailed radiative transfer simulations that compare the\nmodel results to images from UV to submm wavelengths are a way to break this\ndegeneracy, as are UV polarisation measurements.\n", "  We present the identification of two previously known young objects in the\nsolar neighbourhood as a likely very wide binary. TYC 9486-927-1, an active,\nrapidly rotating early-M dwarf, and 2MASS J21265040-8140293, a low-gravity L3\ndwarf previously identified as candidate members of the $\\sim$45 Myr old Tucana\nHorologium association (TucHor). An updated proper motion measurement of the L3\nsecondary, and a detailed analysis of the pair's kinematics in the context of\nknown nearby, young stars, reveals that they share common proper motion and are\nlikely bound. New observations and analyses reveal the primary exhibits Li\n6708~\\AA~absorption consistent with M dwarfs younger than TucHor but older than\nthe $\\sim$10 Myr TW Hydra association yielding an age range of 10-45 Myr. A\nrevised kinematic analysis suggests the space motions and positions of the pair\nare closer to, but not entirely in agreement with, the $\\sim$24 Myr old $\\beta$\nPictoris moving group. This revised 10-45 Myr age range yields a mass range of\n11.6--15 M$_J$ for the secondary. It is thus likely 2MASS\nJ21265040-8140293short is the widest orbit planetary mass object known\n($>$4500AU) and its estimated mass, age, spectral type, and $T_{eff}$ are\nsimilar to the well-studied planet $\\beta$ Pictoris b. Because of their extreme\nseparation and youth, this low-mass pair provide an interesting case study for\nvery wide binary formation and evolution.\n", "  We present the analysis of multiband time-series data for a sample of 24\nCepheids in the field of the Large Magellanic Cloud cluster NGC1866. Very\naccurate BVI VLT photometry is combined with archival UBVI data, covering a\nlarge temporal window, to obtain precise mean magnitudes and periods with\ntypical errors of 1-2% and of 1 ppm, respectively. These results represent the\nfirst accurate and homogeneous dataset for a substantial sample of Cepheid\nvariables belonging to a cluster and hence sharing common distance, age and\noriginal chemical composition. Comparisons of the resulting multiband\nPeriod-Luminosity and Wesenheit relations to both empirical and theoretical\nresults for the Large Magellanic Cloud are presented and discussed to derive\nthe distance of the cluster and to constrain the mass-luminosity relation of\nthe Cepheids. The adopted theoretical scenario is also tested by comparison\nwith independent calibrations of the Cepheid Wesenheit zero point based on\ntrigonometric parallaxes and Baade-Wesselink techniques. Our analysis suggests\nthat a mild overshooting and/or a moderate mass loss can affect\nintermediate-mass stellar evolution in this cluster and gives a distance\nmodulus of 18.50 +- 0.01 mag. The obtained V,I color-magnitude diagram is also\nanalysed and compared with both synthetic models and theoretical isochrones for\na range of ages and metallicities and for different efficiencies of core\novershooting. As a result, we find that the age of NGC1866 is about 140 Myr,\nassuming Z = 0.008 and the mild efficiency of overshooting suggested by the\ncomparison with the pulsation models.\n", "  We present a follow-up study to the imaging polarimetry performed by Hayes\net. al. 2011 on LAB1 in the SSA22 protocluster region. Arguably the most\nwell-known Lyman-$\\alpha$ \"blob\", this radio-quiet emission-line nebula likely\nhosts a galaxy which is either undergoing significant star formation or hosts\nan AGN, or both. We obtain deep, spatially resolved spectro-polarimetry of the\nLy$\\alpha$ emission and detect integrated linear polarization of\n$9$-$13\\%\\pm2$-$3\\%$ at a distance of approximately 15 kpc north and south of\nthe peak of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ surface brightness with polarization vectors\nlying tangential to the galactic central source. In these same regions, we also\ndetect a wavelength dependence in the polarization which is low at the center\nof the Ly$\\alpha$ line profile and rises substantially in the wings of the\nprofile. These polarization signatures are easily explained by a weak\nout-flowing shell model. The spectral dependence of the polarization presented\nhere provide a framework for future observations and interpretations of the\nsouthern portion of LAB1 in that any model for this system must be able to\nreproduce this particular spectral dependence. However, questions still remain\nfor the northern-most spur of LAB1. In this region we detect total linear\npolarization of between $3$ and $20\\%$ at the $5\\%$ significance level.\nSimulations predict that polarization should increase with radius for a\nsymmetric geometry. That the northern spur does not suggests either that this\nregion is not symmetric (which is likely) and exhibits variations in columns\ndensity, or that it is kinematically distinct from the rest of LAB1 and powered\nby another mechanism altogether.\n", "  Models of planet formation and disc evolution predict a variety of\nobservables in the dust structure of protoplanetary discs. Here we present\nAtacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band-6 and Band-7\nobservations of the transition disc Sz\\,91 showing that the continuum emission\nat 870$\\mu$m, which is dominated by emission from large dust grains, is\nlocalized in an optically thin narrow ring. We find that most of the emission\n($\\sim95\\%$) is concentrated in a ring located at 110 au from the central star\nthat is only about 44 au wide. In contrast, the $^{12}\\mathrm{CO}$ (2-1)\nemission peaks closer to the star and is detected up to $\\sim488$ au from the\nstar. The concentration of large grains in a ring-like structure while the gas\ndisc extends much further in and further out is in qualitative agreement with\npredictions of hydrodynamical models of planet-disc interactions including\nradial drift and gas drag.\n", "  Changing physical conditions in the vicinity of protostars allow for a rich\nand interesting chemistry to occur. Heating and cooling of the gas allows\nmolecules to be released from and frozen out on dust grains. These changes in\nphysics, traced by chemistry, as well as the kinematical information allows us\nto distinguish between different scenarios describing the infall of matter and\nthe launching of molecular outflows and jets. We aim at determining the spatial\ndistribution of different species, of different chemical origin. This is to\nexamine the physical processes in play in the observed region. From the\nkinematical information of the emission lines we aim at determining the nature\nof the infalling and outflowing gas in the system. We also aim at determining\nthe physical properties of the outflow. Maps from the Sub-Millimeter Array\nreveal the spatial distribution of the gaseous emission toward IRAS15398-3359.\nThe line radiative transfer code LIME is used to construct a full 3D model of\nthe system taking all relevant components and scales into account. CO, HCO+ and\nN2H+ are detected and are shown to trace the motions of the outflow. For CO,\nalso the circumstellar envelope and the surrounding cloud have a profound\nimpact on the observed line profiles. N2H+ is detected in the outflow, but is\nsuppressed towards the central region, perhaps due to the competing reaction\nbetween CO and H3+ in the densest regions as well as destruction of N2H+ by CO.\nN2D+ is detected in a ridge south-west from the protostellar condensation. The\nmorphology and kinematics of the CO emission suggests that the source is\nyounger than 1000 years. The mass, momentum, momentum rate, mechanical\nluminosity, kinetic energy and mass-loss rate are also all estimated to be low.\nA full 3D radiative transfer model of the system can explain all the\nkinematical and morphological features in the system.\n", "  We employ optical and UV observations to present SEDs for two\nreverberation-mapped samples of super-Eddington and sub-Eddington AGN with\nsimilar luminosity distributions. The samples are fitted with accretion disc\nmodels in order to look for SED differences that depend on the Eddington ratio.\nThe fitting takes into account measured BH mass and accretion rates, BH spin\nand intrinsic reddening of the sources. All objects in both groups can be\nfitted by thin AD models over the range 0.2-1$\\,\\mu$m with reddening as a free\nparameter. The intrinsic reddening required to fit the data are relatively\nsmall, $E(B-V)\\leq0.2$~mag, except for one source. Super-Eddington AGN seem to\nrequire more reddening. The distribution of $E(B-V)$ is similar to what is\nobserved in larger AGN samples. The best fit disc models recover very well the\nBH mass and accretion for the two groups. However, the SEDs are very different,\nwith super-Eddington sources requiring much more luminous far-UV continuum. The\nexact amount depends on the possible saturation of the UV radiation in slim\ndiscs. In particular, we derive for the super-Eddington sources a typical\nbolometric correction at 5100\\AA{} of 60-150 compared with a median of $\\sim$20\nfor the sub-Eddington AGN. The measured torus luminosity relative to $\\lambda\nL_{\\lambda}(5100\\AA{}$) are similar in both groups. The $\\alpha_{OX}$\ndistribution is similar too. However, we find extremely small torus covering\nfactors for super-Eddington sources, an order of magnitude smaller than those\nof sub-Eddington AGN. The small differences between the groups regarding the\nspectral range 0.2-22$\\,\\mu$m, and the significant differences related to the\npart of the SED that we cannot observed may be consistent with some slim disc\nmodels. An alternative explanation is that present day slim-disc models\nover-estimate the far UV luminosity of such objects by a large amount.\n", "  Supernova (SN) 1987A was a peculiar H-rich event with a long-rising (LR)\nlight curve (LC), stemming from a compact blue supergiant star (BSG). Only a\nfew similar events have been presented in the literature. We present new data\nfor a sample of 6 LR Type II SNe (SNe II), 3 of which were discovered and\nobserved by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and 3 observed by the Caltech\nCore-Collapse Project (CCCP). Our aim is to enlarge the family of LR SNe II,\ncharacterizing their properties. Spectra, LCs, and host-galaxies (HG) of these\nSNe are presented. Comparisons with known SN 1987A-like events are shown, with\nemphasis on the absolute magnitudes, colors, expansion velocities, and HG\nmetallicities. Bolometric properties are derived from the multiband LC. By\nmodeling the early-time LCs with scaling relations derived from the SuperNova\nExplosion Code (SNEC) models of MESA progenitor stars, we estimate the\nprogenitor radii of these SNe and other progenitor parameters. We present\nPTF12kso, a LR SN II with the largest amount of 56Ni mass for this class.\nPTF09gpn and PTF12kso are found at the lowest HG metallicities for this SN\ngroup. The variety of early LC luminosities depends on the wide range of\nprogenitor radii, from a few tens of solar radii (SN 2005ci) up to thousands\n(SN 2004ek) with intermediate cases between 100 (PTF09gpn) and 300 solar radii\n(SN 2004em). We confirm that LR SNe II with LC shapes closely resembling that\nof SN 1987A generally arise from BSGs. However, some of them likely have\nprogenitors with larger radii (~300 solar radii, typical of yellow supergiants)\nand can thus be regarded as intermediate cases between normal SNe IIP and SN\n1987A-like SNe. Some extended red supergiant (RSG) stars such as the progenitor\nof SN 2004ek can also produce LR SNe II if they synthesized a large amount of\n56Ni. Low HG metallicity is confirmed as a characteristic of BSG SNe.\n", "  We study the effect of a mass term in the spontaneous scalarization of\nneutron stars, for a wide range of scalar field parameters and neutron star\nequations of state. Even though massless scalars have been the focus of\ninterest in spontaneous scalarization so far, recent observations of binary\nsystems rule out most of their interesting parameter space. We point out that\nadding a mass term to the scalar field potential is a natural extension to the\nmodel that avoids these observational bounds if the Compton wavelength of the\nscalar is small compared to the binary separation. Our model is formally\nsimilar to the asymmetron scenario recently introduced in application to\ncosmology, though here we are interested in consequences for neutron stars and\nthus consider a mass term that does not modify the geometry on cosmological\nscales. We review the allowed values for the mass and scalarization parameters\nin the theory given current binary system observations and black hole spin\nmeasurements. We show that within the allowed ranges, spontaneous scalarization\ncan have nonperturbative, strong effects that may lead to observable signatures\nin binary neutron star or black hole-neutron star mergers, or even in isolated\nneutron stars.\n", "  A gas of ultracold molecules interacting via the long-range dipolar potential\noffers a highly controlled environment in which to study strongly correlated\nphases. However, at particle coalescence the divergent $1/r^3$ dipolar\npotential and associated pathological wavefunction hinder computational\nanalysis. For a dipolar gas constrained to two dimensions we overcome these\nnumerical difficulties by proposing a pseudopotential that is explicitly smooth\nat particle coalescence, resulting in a 2000-times speedup in diffusion Monte\nCarlo calculations. The pseudopotential delivers the scattering phase shifts of\nthe dipolar interaction with an accuracy of $10^{-5}$ and predicts the energy\nof a dipolar gas to an accuracy of $10^{-4}E_\\mathrm{F}$ in a diffusion Monte\nCarlo calculation.\n", "  Previous studies have revealed Jupiter-family comet 252P/LINEAR as a comet\nthat was recently transported into the near-Earth object (NEO) region in\n$\\sim1800$~AD yet only being weakly active. In this Letter, we examine the\n\"formed (almost) dead\" hypothesis for 252P/LINEAR using both dynamical and\nobservational approaches. By statistically examining the dynamical evolution of\n252P/LINEAR over a period of $10^7$~years, we find the median elapsed residency\nin the NEO region to be $4\\times10^2$~years which highlights the likelihood of\n252P/LINEAR as an (almost) first-time NEO. With available cometary and meteor\nobservations, we find the dust production rate of 252P/LINEAR to be at the\norder of $10^6$~kg per orbit since its entry to the NEO region. These two lines\nof evidence support the hypothesis that the comet was likely to have formed in\na volatile-poor environment. Cometary and meteor observations during the\ncomet's unprecedented close approach to the Earth around 2016 Mar. 21 would be\nuseful for the understanding of the surface and evolutionary properties of this\nunique comet.\n", "  We report a Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) search for HI 21cm\nemission from a large sample of star-forming galaxies at $z \\approx 1.18 -\n1.34$, lying in sub-fields of the DEEP2 Redshift Survey. The search was carried\nout by co-adding (\"stacking\") the HI 21cm emission spectra of 857 galaxies,\nafter shifting each galaxy's HI 21cm spectrum to its rest frame. We obtain the\n$3\\sigma$ upper limit S$_{\\rm{HI}} < 2.5 \\mu$Jy on the average HI 21cm flux\ndensity of the 857 galaxies, at a velocity resolution of $\\approx 315$ km\ns$^{-1}$. This yields the $3\\sigma$ constraint M$_{\\rm{HI}} < 2.1 \\times\n10^{10} \\times \\left[\\Delta {\\rm V}/315 \\rm{km/s} \\right]^{1/2}\n\\textrm{M}_\\odot$ on the average HI mass of the 857 stacked galaxies, the first\ndirect constraint on the atomic gas mass of galaxies at $z > 1$. The implied\nlimit on the average atomic gas mass fraction (relative to stars) is ${\\rm\nM}_{\\rm GAS}/{\\rm M}_* < 0.5$, comparable to the cold molecular gas mass\nfraction in similar star-forming galaxies at these redshifts. We find that the\ncosmological mass density of neutral atomic gas in massive star-forming\ngalaxies at $z \\approx 1.3$ is $\\Omega_{\\rm GAS} < 3.7 \\times 10^{-4}$,\nsignificantly lower than $\\Omega_{\\rm GAS}$ estimates in both galaxies in the\nlocal Universe and damped Lyman-$\\alpha$ absorbers at $z \\geq 2.2$. Massive\nblue star-forming galaxies thus do not appear to dominate the neutral atomic\ngas content of the Universe at $z \\approx 1.3$.\n", "  The measurement of vacuum polarisation effects, in particular vacuum\nbirefringence, using combined optical and x-ray laser pulses is now actively\npursued. Here we briefly examine the feasibility of two alternative setups. The\nfirst utilises an alternative target, namely a converging dipole pulse, and the\nsecond uses an alternative probe, namely the synchrotron-like emission from\nhighly energetic particles, themselves interacting with a laser pulse. The\nlatter setup has been proposed for experiments at ELI-NP.\n", "  Pyrochlore oxides possessing \"all-in-all-out\" spin ordering have attracted\nburgeoning interest as a rich ground of emergent states. This ordering has two\ndistinct types of magnetic domains (all-in-all-out or all-out-all-in) with\nbroken time-reversal symmetry, and a non-trivial metallic surface state has\nbeen theoretically demonstrated to appear at their domain wall. Here, we report\non observation of this metallic conduction at the single\nall-in-all-out/all-out-all-in magnetic domain wall formed at the\nheterointerface of two pyrochlore iridates. By utilizing different\nmagnetoresponses of them with different lanthanide ions, the domain wall is\ncontrollably inserted at the heterointerface, the surface state being detected\nas anomalous conduction enhancement with a ferroic hysteresis. Our\nestablishment paves the way for further investigation and manipulation of this\nnew type of surface transport.\n", "  We study a variation to the SUSY Left-Right symmetric model based on the\ngauge group $SU(3)_c\\times SU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R\\times U(1)_{BL}$. Beyond the\nquark and lepton superfields we only introduce a second Higgs bidoublet to\nproduce realistic fermion mass matrices. This model does not include any\n$SU(2)_R$ triplets. We calculate renormalization group evolutions of soft SUSY\nparameters at the one-loop level down to low energy. We find that an $SU(2)_R$\nslepton doublet acquires a negative mass squared at low energies, so that the\nbreaking of $SU(2)_R\\times U(1)_{BL}\\rightarrow U(1)_Y$ is realized by a\nnon-zero vacuum expectation value of a right-handed sneutrino. Small neutrino\nmasses are produced through neutrino mixings with gauginos. Mass limits on the\n$SU(2)_R\\times U(1)_{BL}$ sector are obtained by direct search results at the\nLHC as well as lepton-gaugino mixing bounds from the LEP precision data.\n", "  We construct an X-ray spectral model of reprocessing by a torus in an active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN) with a Monte Carlo simulation framework MONACO. Two\ntorus geometries of smooth and clumpy cases are considered and compared. In\norder to reproduce a Compton shoulder accurately, MONACO includes not only free\nelectron scattering but also bound electron scattering. Raman and Reyleigh\nscattering are also treated, and scattering cross sections dependent on\nchemical states of hydrogen and helium are included. Doppler broadening by\nturbulence velocity can be implemented. Our model gives consistent results with\nother available models, such as MYTorus, except for differences due to\ndifferent physical parameters and assumptions. We studied the dependence on\ntorus parameters for Compton shoulder, and found that a intensity ratio of\nCompton shoulder to line core mainly depends on the column density, inclination\nangle, and metal abundance. For instance, an increase of metal abundance makes\nthe Compton shoulder relatively weak. Also, shape of Compton shoulder depends\non the column density. Furthermore, these dependences become different between\nsmooth and clumpy cases. Then, we discuss the possibility of ASTRO-H SXS\nspectroscopy of Compton shoulder in AGN reflection spectra.\n", "  Niobium-92 is an extinct proton-rich nuclide, which decays to 92Zr with a\nhalf-life of 37 Ma. This radionuclide potentially offers a unique opportunity\nto determine the timescales of early Solar System processes and the site(s) of\nnucleosynthesis for p-nuclei, once its initial abundance and distribution in\nthe Solar System are well established. Here we present internal Nb-Zr isochrons\nfor three basaltic achondrites with known U-Pb ages: the angrite NWA 4590, the\neucrite Agoult, and the ungrouped achondrite Ibitira. Our results show that the\nrelative Nb-Zr isochron ages of the three meteorites are consistent with the\ntime intervals obtained from the Pb-Pb chronometer for pyroxene and\nplagioclase, indicating that 92Nb was homogeneously distributed among their\nsource regions. The Nb-Zr and Pb-Pb data for NWA 4590 yield the most reliable\nand precise reference point for anchoring the Nb-Zr chronometer to the absolute\ntimescale: an initial 92Nb/93Nb ratio of $(1.4 \\pm 0.5) \\times 10^{-5}$ at\n$4557.93 \\pm 0.36$ Ma, which corresponds to a 92Nb/93Nb ratio of $(1.7 \\pm 0.6)\n\\times 10^{-5}$ at the time of the Solar System formation. On the basis of this\nnew initial ratio, we demonstrate the capability of the Nb-Zr chronometer to\ndate early Solar System objects including troilite and rutile, such as iron and\nstony-iron meteorites. Furthermore, we estimate a nucleosynthetic production\nratio of 92Nb to the p-nucleus 92Mo between 0.0015 and 0.035. This production\nratio, together with the solar abundances of other p-nuclei with similar\nmasses, can be best explained if these light p-nuclei were primarily\nsynthesized by photodisintegration reactions in Type Ia supernovae.\n", "  The F-type star KIC 8462852 has recently been identified as an exceptional\ntarget for SETI (search for extraterrestrial intelligence) observations. We\ndescribe an analysis methodology for optical SETI, which we have used to\nanalyse nine hours of serendipitous archival observations of KIC 8462852 made\nwith the VERITAS gamma-ray observatory between 2009 and 2015. No evidence of\npulsed optical beacons, above a pulse intensity at the Earth of approximately 1\nphoton per m^2, is found. We also discuss the potential use of imaging\natmospheric Cherenkov telescope arrays in searching for extremely short\nduration optical transients in general.\n", "  We investigate competition between two phase transitions of the second kind\ninduced by the self-attractive nonlinearity, viz., self-trapping of the leaky\nmodes, and spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of both fully trapped and leaky\nstates. We use a one-dimensional mean-field model, which combines the cubic\nnonlinearity and a double-well-potential (DWP) structure with an elevated\nfloor, which supports leaky modes (quasi-bound states) in the linear limit. The\nsetting can be implemented in nonlinear optics and BEC. The order in which the\nSSB and self-trapping transitions take place with the growth of the\nnonlinearity strength depends on the height of the central barrier of the DWP:\nthe SSB happens first if the barrier is relatively high, while self-trapping\ncomes first if the barrier is lower. The SSB of the leaky modes is\ncharacterized by specific asymmetry of their radiation tails, which, in\naddition, feature a resonant dependence on the relation between the total size\nof the system and radiation wavelength. As a result of the SSB, the instability\nof symmetric modes initiates spontaneous Josephson oscillations. Collisions of\nfreely moving solitons with the DWP structure admit trapping of an incident\nsoliton into a state of persistent shuttle motion, due to emission of\nradiation. The study is carried out numerically, and basic results are\nexplained by means of analytical considerations.\n", "  We use direct method oxygen abundances in combination with strong optical\nemission lines, stellar masses ($M_{\\star}$), and star formation rates (SFRs)\nto recalibrate the N2, O3N2, and N2O2 oxygen abundance diagnostics. We stack\nspectra of $\\sim$200,000 star-forming galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey in bins of $M_{\\star}$ and SFR offset from the star forming main\nsequence to measure the weak emission lines needed to apply the direct method.\nAll three new calibrations are reliable to within $\\pm 0.10$ dex from\n$\\log(M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot}) \\sim 7.5 - 10.5$ and up to at least $200~M_{\\odot}$\nyr$^{-1}$ in SFR. The N2O2 diagnostic is the least subject to systematic\nbiases. We apply the diagnostics to galaxies in the local universe and\ninvestigate the $M_{\\star}$-$Z$-${\\rm SFR}$ relation. The N2 and O3N2\ndiagnostics suggest the SFR dependence of the $M_{\\star}$-$Z$-${\\rm SFR}$\nrelation varies with both $M_{\\star}$ and $\\Delta \\log(SSFR)$, whereas the N2O2\ndiagnostic suggests a nearly constant dependence on SFR. We apply our\ncalibrations to a sample of high redshift galaxies from the literature, and\nfind them to be metal poor relative to local galaxies with similar $M_{\\star}$\nand SFR. The calibrations do reproduce direct method abundances of the local\nanalogs. We conclude that the $M_{\\star}$-$Z$-${\\rm SFR}$ relation evolves with\nredshift.\n", "  A strong correlation exists between the total mass of a globular cluster (GC)\nsystem and the virial halo mass of the host galaxy. However, the total halo\nmass in this correlation is a statistical measure conducted on spatial scales\nthat are some ten times that of a typical GC system. Here we investigate the\nconnection between GC systems and galaxy's dark matter on comparable spatial\nscales, using dynamical masses measured on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis. Our sample\nconsists of 17 well-studied massive (stellar mass $\\sim$10$^{11}$ M$_{\\odot}$)\nearly-type galaxies from the SLUGGS survey. We find the strongest correlation\nto be that of the blue (metal-poor) GC subpopulation and the dark matter\ncontent. This correlation implies that the dark matter mass of a galaxy can be\nestimated to within a factor of two from careful imaging of its GC system. The\nratio of the GC system mass to that of the enclosed dark matter is nearly\nconstant. We also find a strong correlation between the fraction of blue GCs\nand the fraction of enclosed dark matter, so that a typical galaxy with a blue\nGC fraction of 60 per cent has a dark matter fraction of 86 per cent over\nsimilar spatial scales. Both halo growth and removal (via tidal stripping) may\nplay some role in shaping this trend. In the context of the two-phase model for\ngalaxy formation, we find galaxies with the highest fractions of accreted stars\nto have higher dark matter fractions for a given fraction of blue GCs.\n", "  We report on an extensive study of the evolution of domain wall networks in\nFriedmann-Lema\\^{\\i}tre-Robertson-Walker universes by means of the largest\ncurrently available field-theory simulations. These simulations were done in\n$4096^3$ boxes and for a range of different fixed expansion rates, as well as\nfor the transition between the radiation and matter eras. A detailed comparison\nwith the velocity-dependent one-scale (VOS) model shows that this cannot\naccurately reproduce the results of the entire range of simulated regimes if\none assumes that the phenomenological energy loss and momentum parameters are\nconstants. We therefore discuss how a more accurate modeling of these\nparameters can be done, specifically by introducing an additional mechanism of\nenergy loss (scalar radiation, which is particularly relevant for regimes with\nrelatively little damping) and a modified momentum parameter which is a\nfunction of velocity (in analogy to what was previously done for cosmic\nstrings). We finally show that this extended model, appropriately calibrated,\nprovides an accurate fit to our simulations.\n", "  We discuss integral field spectra of the compact star-forming complex that is\nthe brightest near-infrared (NIR) source in the central regions of the\nstarburst galaxy NGC 253. The spectra cover the H and K passbands and were\nrecorded with the Gemini NIR Spectrograph during sub-arcsec seeing conditions.\nAbsorption features in the spectrum of the star-forming complex are weaker than\nin the surroundings. An absorption feature is found near 1.78um that coincides\nwith the location of a C2 bandhead. Emission lines of Brgamma, [FeII], and\nHeI2.06um do not track the NIR continuum light. Pockets of star-forming\nactivity that do not have associated concentrations of red supergiants, and so\nlikely have ages < 8 Myr, are found along the western edge of the complex, and\nthere is evidence that one such pocket contains a rich population of Wolf-Rayet\nstars. Unless the star-forming complex is significantly more metal-poor than\nthe surroundings, then a significant fraction of its total mass is in stars\nwith ages < 8 Myr. If the present-day star formation rate is maintained then\nthe time scale to double its stellar mass ranges from a few Myr to a few tens\nof Myr, depending on the contribution made by stars older than ~ 8 Myr. If --\nas suggested by some studies -- the star-forming complex is centered on the\ngalaxy nucleus, then the nucleus of NGC 253 is currently experiencing a phase\nof rapid growth in its stellar mass.\n", "  In a recent paper, Hagelstein and Pascalutsa examine the error associated\nwith an expansion of proton structure corrections to the Lamb shift in terms of\nmoments of the charge distribution. They propose a small modification to a\nconventional parameterization of the proton's charge form factor and show that\nthis can resolve the proton radius puzzle. However, while the size of the\n\"bump\" they add to the form factor is small, it is large compared to the total\nproton structure effects in the initial parameterization, yielding a final form\nfactor that is unphysical. Reducing their modification to the point where the\nresulting form factor is physical does not allow for a resolution of the radius\npuzzle.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral lineshapes\nin an optically-thick helium gas under near-infrared (IR) perturbation. In our\nexperimental and theoretical work, we systematically vary the IR intensity,\ntime-delay, gas density and IR polarization parameters to study lineshape\nmodifications induced by collective interactions, in a regime beyond the single\natom response of a thin, dilute gas. In both experiment and theory, we find\nthat specific features in the frequency-domain absorption profile, and their\nevolution with propagation distance, can be attributed to the interplay between\nresonant attosecond pulse propagation and IR induced phase shifts. Our\ncalculations show that this interplay also manifests itself in the time domain,\nwith the IR pulse influencing the reshaping of the XUV pulse propagating in the\nresonant medium.\n", "  To comply with the critique of the Comment [J. Arrington, arXiv:1602.01461],\nwe consider another modification of the proton electric form factor, which\nresolves the \"proton-radius puzzle\". The proposed modification satisfies all\nthe consistency criteria put forward in the Comment, and yet has a similar\nimpact on the puzzle as that of the original paper. Contrary to the concluding\nstatement of the Comment, it is not difficult to find an ad hoc modification of\nthe form factor at low $Q$ that resolves the discrepancy and is consistent with\nanalyticity constraints. We emphasize once again that we do not consider such\nan ad hoc modification of the proton form factor to be a solution of the puzzle\nuntil a physical mechanism for it is found.\n", "  We analyzed high-cadence sit-and-stare observations acquired with the\nHinode/EIS spectrometer and HXR measurements acquired with RHESSI during an\nM-class flare. During the flare impulsive phase, we observe no significant\nflows in the cooler Fe XIII line but strong upflows, up to 80-150 km/s, in the\nhotter Fe XVI line. The largest Doppler shifts observed in the Fe XVI line were\nco-temporal with the sharp intensity peak. The electron density obtained from a\nFe XIII line pair ratio exhibited fast increase (within two minutes) from the\npre-flare level of 5.01x10^(9) cm^(-3) to 3.16x10^(10) cm^(-3) during the flare\npeak. The nonthermal energy flux density deposited from the coronal\nacceleration site to the lower atmospheric layers during the flare peak was\nfound to be 1.34x10^(10) erg/s/cm^(2) for a low-energy cut-off that was\nestimated to be 16 keV. During the decline flare phase, we found a secondary\nintensity and density peak of lower amplitude that was preceded by upflows of\n15 km/s that were detected in both lines. The flare was also accompanied by a\nfilament eruption that was partly captured by the EIS observations. We derived\nDoppler velocities of 250-300 km/s for the upflowing filament material.The\nspectroscopic results for the flare peak are consistent with the scenario of\nexplosive chromospheric evaporation, although a comparatively low value of the\nnonthermal energy flux density was determined for this phase of the flare. This\noutcome is discussed in the context of recent hydrodynamic simulations. It\nprovides observational evidence that the response of the atmospheric plasma\nstrongly depends on the properties of the electron beams responsible for the\nheating, in particular the steepness of the energy distribution.\n", "  Exact formulas of diagonal conductivity $\\sigma_{xx}$ and Hall conductivity\n$\\sigma_{xy}$ are derived from the Kubo formula in hybridized two-orbital\nsystems with arbitrary band dispersions. On the basis of the theoretical\nframework for the Fermi liquid based on these formulas, the ground-state\nproperties of the periodic Anderson model with electron correlation and weak\nimpurity scattering are studied on the square lattice. It is shown that\nimbalance of the mass-renormalization factors in $\\sigma_{xx}$ and\n$\\sigma_{xy}$ causes remarkable increase in the valence-fluctuation regime as\nthe f level increases while the cancellation of the renormalization factors\ncauses slight increase in $\\sigma_{xx}$ and $\\sigma_{xy}$ in the Kondo regime.\nThe Hall coefficient $R_{\\rm H}$ shows almost constant behavior in both the\nregimes. Near half filling, $R_{\\rm H}$ is expressed by the total hole density\nas $R_{\\rm H}=1/(\\bar{n}_{\\rm hole}e)$ while $R_{\\rm H}$ approaches zero near\nquarter filling, which reflects the curvature of the Fermi surface. These\nresults hold as far as the damping rate for f electrons is less than about\n$10~\\%$ of the renormalized hybridization gap. From these results we discuss\npressure dependence of residual resistivity and normal Hall effect in Ce- and\nYb-based heavy electron systems.\n", "  Hexagonal LuFeO$_3$ has drawn a lot of research attention due to its\ncontentious room-temperature multiferroicity. Due to the unstability of\nhexagonal phase in the bulk form, most experimental studies focused on\nLuFeO$_3$ thin films which can be stabilized by strain using proper substrates.\nHere we report on the hexagonal phase stabilization, magnetism, and\nmagnetoelectric coupling of bulk LuFeO$_3$ by partial Sc-substitution of Lu.\nFirst, our first-principles calculations show that the hexagonal structure can\nbe stabilized by partial Sc substitution, while the multiferroic properties\nincluding the noncollinear magnetic order and geometric ferroelectricity remain\nrobustly unaffected. Therefore, Lu$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$FeO$_3$ can act as a platform\nto check the multiferroicity of LuFeO$_3$ and related materials in the bulk\nform. Second, the magnetic characterizations on bulk Lu$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$FeO$_3$\ndemonstrate a magnetic anomaly (probable antiferromagnetic ordering) above room\ntemperature, $\\sim425-445$ K, followed by magnetic transitions in low\ntemperatures ($\\sim167-172$ K). In addition, a magnetoelectric response is\nobserved in the low temperature region. Our study provides useful information\non the multiferroic physics of hexagonal $R$FeO$_3$ and related systems.\n", "  Spectra of ultracold neutrons that appeared in experiments on neutron\ndiffraction by a moving grating were measured using the time-of-flight Fourier\nspectrometer. Diffraction lines of five orders were observed simultaneously.\nThe obtained data are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions based\non the multiwave dynamical theory of neutron diffraction by a moving grating.\n", "  We present a systematic study of the relationship between Type Ia Supernova\n(SN Ia) properties, and the characteristics of their host galaxies, using a\nsample of 581 SNe Ia from the full Sloan Digital Sky Survey II (SDSS-II) SN\nSurvey. We also investigate the effects of this on the cosmological constraints\nderived from SNe~Ia. Compared to previous studies, our sample is larger by a\nfactor of $>4$, and covers a substantially larger redshift range (up to z~0.5),\nwhich is directly applicable to the volume of cosmological interest. We measure\na significant correlation (>5\\sigma) between the host-galaxy stellar-mass and\nthe SN~Ia Hubble Residuals (HR). We find a weak correlation (1.4\\sigma) between\nthe host-galaxy metallicity as measured from emission lines in the spectra, and\nthe SN~Ia HR. We also find evidence that the slope of the correlation between\nhost-galaxy mass and HR is -0.11\n$\\mathrm{mag}/\\mathrm{log}(\\mathrm{M}_{\\mathrm{host}}/\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot})$\nsteeper in lower metallicity galaxies. We test the effects on a cosmological\nanalysis using both the derived best-fitting correlations between host\nparameters and HR, and by allowing an additional free parameter in the fit to\naccount for host properties which we then marginalize over when determining\ncosmological parameters. We see a shift towards more negative values of the\nequation of state parameter $w$, along with a shift to lower values of\n$\\Omega_\\mathrm{m}$ after applying mass or metallicity corrections. The shift\nin cosmological parameters with host-galaxy stellar-mass correction is\nconsistent with previous studies. We find a best-fitting cosmology of\n$\\Omega_{\\mathrm{m}} =0.266_{-0.016}^{+0.016}$,\n$\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=0.740_{-0.018}^{+0.018}$ and $w=-1.151_{-0.121}^{+0.123}$\n(statistical errors only).\n", "  Several studies indicate that radio-loud (RL) Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)\nare produced only by the most massive black holes (BH), $M_{\\rm BH} \\sim\n10^8$-$10^{10} M_\\odot$. This idea has been challenged by the discovery of RL\nNarrow Line Seyfert 1 (RL NLSy1), having estimated masses of $M_{\\rm\nBH}$$\\sim$$10^6$-$10^7$ M$_\\odot$. However, these low $M_{\\rm BH}$ estimates\nmight be due to projection effects. Spectropolarimetry allows us to test this\npossibility by looking at RL NLSy1s under a different perspective, i.e., from\nthe viewing angle of the scattering material. We here report the results of a\npilot study of VLT spectropolarimetric observations of the RL NLSy1 PKS\n2004-447. Its polarization properties are remarkably well reproduced by models\nin which the scattering occurs in an equatorial structure surrounding its broad\nline region, seen close to face-on. In particular, we detect a polarized\nH$\\alpha$ line with a width of $\\sim$ 9,000 km s$^{-1}$, $\\sim 6$ times broader\nthan the width seen in direct light. This corresponds to a revised estimate of\n$M_{\\rm BH}$$\\sim$$6\\times10^8$ M$_\\odot$, well within the typical range of RL\nAGN. The double-peaked polarized broad H$\\alpha$ profile of the target suggests\nthat the rare combination of the orientation effects and a broad line region\ndominated by the rotation might account for this class of objects, casting\ndoubts on the virial estimates of BH mass for type-I AGN.\n", "  Recent studies have found that radio-AGN selected by radio-loudness show\nlittle difference in terms of their host galaxy properties when compared to\nnon-AGN galaxies of similar stellar mass and redshift. Using new 1.4~GHz VLBI\nobservations of the COSMOS field we find that approximately 49$\\pm8$\\% of\nhigh-mass (M $>$ 10$^{10.5}$ M$_{\\odot}$), high luminosity (L$_{1.4}$ $>$\n10$^{24}$ W~Hz$^{-1}$) radio-AGN possess a VLBI detected counterpart. These\nobjects show no discernible bias towards specific stellar masses, redshifts or\nhost properties other than what is shown by the radio-AGN population in\ngeneral. Radio-AGN that are detected in VLBI observations are not special, but\nform a representative sample of the radio-loud AGN population.\n", "  Empirically, the X-ray luminosity LX from M dwarfs has been found to have an\nupper limit of about 0.2% of the bolometric flux Lbol. In the limit where\nmagnetic fields in M dwarfs are generated in equipartition with convective\nmotions, we use stellar models to calculate the energy flux of Alfven waves FA\nas a function of depth in the sub-surface convection zone. Since Alfven waves\nhave the optimal opportunity for wave modes to reach the corona, we suggest\nthat FA sets an upper limit on the mechanical flux Fmech which causes coronal\nheating. This suggestion accounts quantitatively for the saturated values of\nLX/Lbol which have been reported empirically for M dwarfs.\n", "  Results are reported for single crystal specimens of Hf$_2$Te$_2$P and\ncompared to its structural analogue Zr$_2$Te$_2$P, which was recently proposed\nto be a potential reservoir for Dirac physics.[1] Both materials are produced\nusing the iodine vapor transport method and the resulting crystals are\nexfoliable. The bulk electrical transport and thermodynamic properties indicate\nFermi liquid behavior at low temperature for both compounds. Quantum\noscillations are observed in magnetization measurements for fields applied\nparallel but not perpendicular to the $c$-axis, suggesting that the Fermi\nsurfaces are quasi-two dimensional. Frequencies are determined from quantum\noscillations for several parts of the Fermi surfaces. Lifshitz-Kosevich fits to\nthe temperature dependent amplitudes of the oscillations reveal small effective\nmasses, with a particularly small value $m^*$ $=$ 0.046$m_0$ for the {\\alpha}\nbranch of Zr$_2$Te$_2$P. Electronic structure calculations are in good\nagreement with quantum oscillation results and illustrate the effect of a\nstronger spin-orbit interaction going from Zr to Hf. These results suggest that\nby using appropriate tuning parameters this class of materials may deepen the\npool of novel Dirac phenomena.\n", "  The uniqueness of static asymptotically flat photon sphere for static black\nhole solution in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory with arbitrary coupling\nconstant was proposed. Using the conformal positive energy theorem we show that\nthe dilaton sphere subject to the non-extremality condition authorizes a\ncylinder over a topological sphere.\n", "  The magnetic structure of the double perovskite compound Sr$_2$CuTeO$_6$ was\ndetermined from neutron powder diffraction data. This material is magnetically\ndescribed as an $S\\,{=}\\,1/2$ quasi-two-dimensional square-lattice Heisenberg\nmodel with antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor\ninteractions. Sr$_2$CuTeO$_6$ undergoes a magnetic phase transition at $T_{\\rm\nN}\\,{\\simeq}\\,29\\,$ K. The spin structure below $T_{\\rm N}$ is N\\'{e}el\nantiferromagnetic on the square lattice, which means that the nearest-neighbor\ninteraction ($J_1$) is stronger than the next-nearest-neighbor interaction\n($J_2$), in contrast to other isostructural compounds such as Ba$_2$CuWO$_6$\nand Sr$_2$CuWO$_6$, for which $|J_1|\\,{<}\\,|J_2|$ is realized.\n", "  We present GTC-10.4m spectroscopy and multi-band photometry of the faint (r\n~26) optical counterpart of the anomalous X-ray pulsar 4U 0142+61. The 5000 -\n9000 Angs spectrum -- the first obtained for a magnetar -- is featureless,\nallowing us to set an equivalent width upper limit EW < 25 Angs to the presence\nof emission lines in the Halfa region. Multi-band photometry in the g, r, i, z\nSDSS bands obtained at different epochs over 12 years shows no significant\nvariability from minutes-to-years time scales. The photometry has been\ncalibrated, for the first time, against the SDSS itself, resulting in solid\nupper limits to variability ranging from ~0.2 mag in i (over 12 years) to 0.05\nmag in z (over 1.5 years). The shape of the optical + near-infrared (literature\nvalues) spectral energy distribution is not well constrained due to the high\nextinction along the line of sight. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis\nwe find that it can be described by a power-law with a spectral index\nbeta=-0.7+-0.5 and E_(B-V)=1.5+-0.4. We also discuss on the implications of\nadding hard X-ray flux values from literature to the spectral fitting.\n", "  Crustal torsional oscillations depend on not only crust properties but also\nthe stellar mass and radius. Thus, one could extract stellar information by\nidentifying the observed frequencies of stellar oscillations with the crustal\ntorsional oscillations. Owing to the confinement of torsional oscillations\ninside the crust region of neutron stars, we successfully derive an empirical\nformula for the fundamental crustal torsional oscillations as a function of the\nstellar mass, radius, the so-called slope parameter of the nuclear symmetry\nenergy, and the angular index of oscillations, with which one can estimate the\nfrequencies with high accuracy. This empirical formula could be valuable in\nboth the astrophysics and nuclear physics communities.\n", "  Deuterium is created during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, and, in contrast to the\nother light stable nuclei, can only be destroyed thereafter by fusion in\nstellar interiors. In this paper we study the cosmic evolution of the deuterium\nabundance in the interstellar medium and its dispersion using realistic galaxy\nevolution models. We find that models that reproduce the observed metal\nabundance are compatible with observations of the deuterium abundance in the\nlocal ISM and z ~ 3 absorption line systems. In particular, we reproduce the\nlow astration factor which we attribute to a low global star formation\nefficiency. We calculate the dispersion in deuterium abundance arising from\ndifferent structure formation histories in different parts of the Universe. Our\nmodel also predicts an extremely tight correlation between deuterium and metal\nabundances which could be used to measure the primordial deuterium abundance.\n", "  Using linear non-adabatic pulsation analysis, we explore the radial-mode\n(p-mode) stability of stars across a wide range of mass (0.2 <= M <= 50 Msun),\ncomposition (0 <= X <= 0.7, Z=0.001, 0.02), effective temperature (3 000 <=\nT_eff <= 40 000 K), and luminosity (0.01 <= L/M <= 100,000 solar units).We\nidentify the instability boundaries associated with low- to high-order radial\noscillations (0 <= n <=16). The instability boundaries are a strong function of\nboth composition and radial order (n). With decreasing hydrogen abundance we\nfind that i) the classical blue edge of the Cepheid instability strip shifts to\nhigher effective temperature and luminosity, and ii) high-order modes are more\neasily excited and small islands of high radial-order instability develop, some\nof which correspond with real stars. Driving in all cases is by the classical\nkappa-mechanism and/or strange modes. We identify regions of parameter space\nwhere new classes of pulsating variable may, in future, be discovered. The\nmajority of these are associated with reduced hydrogen abundance in the\nenvelope; one has not been identified previously.\n", "  We present an analysis of intermediate-dispersion spectra and photometric\ndata of the newly identified cool, polluted white dwarf NLTT19868. The spectra\nobtained with X-shooter on the Very Large Telescope (VLT)-Melipal show strong\nlines of calcium, and several lines of magnesium, aluminium and iron. We use\nthese spectra and the optical-to-near infrared spectral energy distribution to\nconstrain the atmospheric parameters of NLTT19868. Our analysis shows that\nNLTT19868 is iron poor with respect to aluminium and calcium. A comparison with\nother cool, polluted white dwarfs shows that the Fe to Ca abundance ratio\n(Fe/Ca) varies by up to approximately two orders of magnitudes over a narrow\ntemperature range with NLTT19868 at one extremum in the Fe/Ca ratio and, in\ncontrast, NLTT888 at the other extremum. The sample shows evidence of extreme\ndiversity in the composition of the accreted material: In the case of NLTT888,\nthe inferred composition of the accreted matter is akin to iron-rich planetary\ncore composition, while in the case of NLTT19868 it is close to mantle or\nbulk-Earth composition depleted by subsequent chemical separation at the bottom\nof the convection zone.\n", "  The properties of the Galactic Ridge X-ray Emission (GRXE) observed in the\n2-10 keV band place fundamental constraints on various types of X-ray sources\nin the Milky Way. Although the primarily discrete origin of the emission is now\nwell established, the responsible populations of these sources remain\nuncertain, especially at relatively low fluxes. To provide insights into this\nissue, we systematically characterize the Fe emission line properties of the\ncandidate types of the sources in the solar neighborhood and compare them with\nthose measured for the GRXE. Our source sample includes 6 symbiotic stars\n(SSs), 16 intermediate polars (IPs), 3 polars, 16 quiescent dwarf novae (DNe)\nand 4 active binaries (ABs). We find that the mean equivalent width\n($EW_{6.7}$) of the 6.7-keV line and the mean 7.0/6.7-keV line ratio are\n$107\\pm16.0$ eV and $0.71\\pm 0.04$ for intermediate polars and $221\\pm 135$ eV\nand $0.44\\pm 0.14$ for polars, respectively, which are all substantially\ndifferent from those ($490\\pm15 $~eV and $0.2\\pm 0.08$) for the GRXE. Instead,\nthe GRXE values are better agreed by the $EW_{6.7}$ ($438\\pm 84.6$~eV) and the\nratio ($0.27\\pm 0.06$) observed for the DNe.\n  We further find that the $EW_{6.7}$ is strongly correlated with the 2-10-keV\nluminosity of the DNe, which can be characterized by the relation\n$EW_{6.7}=(438\\pm95 {\\rm~eV}) (L/10^{31}~{\\rm~ergs~s^{-1} })^{(-0.31\\pm0.15)}$.\nAccounting for this correlation, the agreement can be improved further,\nespecially when the contributions from other classes sources to the GRXE are\nconsidered, which all have low $EW_{6.7}$ values. We conclude that the GRXE\nmostly consists of typically faint, but numerous DNe, plus ABs, while magnetic\nCVs are probably mainly the high-flux representatives of the responsible\npopulations and dominate the GRXE only in harder energy bands.\n", "  The abundance of O in planetary nebulae (PNe) has been historically used as a\nmetallicity indicator of the interstellar medium (ISM) where they originated;\ne.g., it has been widely used to study metallicity gradients in our Galaxy and\nbeyond. However, clear observational evidence for O self enrichment in\nlow-metallicity Galactic PNe with C-rich dust has been recently reported. Here\nwe report asymptotic giant branch (AGB) nucleosynthesis predictions for the\nabundances of the CNO elements and helium in the metallicity range Zsun/4 < Z <\n2Zsun. Our AGB models, with diffusive overshooting from all the convective\nborders, predict that O is overproduced in low-Z low-mass (~1-3 Msun) AGB stars\nand nicely reproduce the recent O overabundances observed in C-rich dust PNe.\nThis confirms that O is not always a good proxy of the original ISM metallicity\nand another chemical elements such as Cl or Ar should be used instead. The\nproduction of oxygen by low-mass stars should be thus considered in\ngalactic-evolution models.\n", "  We explain the multiple populations recently found in the 'prototype'\nGlobular Cluster (GC) NGC 2808 in the framework of the asymptotic giant branch\n(AGB) scenario. The chemistry of the five -or more- populations is\napproximately consistent with a sequence of star formation events, starting\nafter the supernovae type II epoch, lasting approximately until the time when\nthe third dredge up affects the AGB evolution (age ~90-120Myr), and ending when\nthe type Ia supernovae begin exploding in the cluster, eventually clearing it\nfrom the gas. The formation of the different populations requires episodes of\nstar formation in AGB gas diluted with different amounts of pristine gas. In\nthe nitrogen-rich, helium-normal population identified in NGC 2808 by the UV\nLegacy Survey of GCs, the nitrogen increase is due to the third dredge up in\nthe smallest mass AGB ejecta involved in the star formation of this population.\nThe possibly-iron-rich small population in NGC 2808 may be a result of\ncontamination by a single type Ia supernova. The NGC 2808 case is used to build\na general framework to understand the variety of 'second generation' stars\nobserved in GCs. Cluster-to-cluster variations are ascribed to differences in\nthe effects of the many processes and gas sources which may be involved in the\nformation of the second generation. We discuss an evolutionary scheme, based on\npollution by delayed type II supernovae, which accounts for the properties of\ns-Fe-anomalous clusters.\n", "  Understanding supersymmetric flux vacua is essential in order to connect\nstring theory to observable physics. In this thesis, flux vacua are studied by\nmaking use of two mathematical frameworks: SU(n)-structures and generalised\ncomplex geometry. Manifolds with SU(n)-structure are generalisations of\nCalabi-Yau manifolds. Generalised complex geometry is a geometrical framework\nthat simultaneously generalises complex and symplectic geometry. Classes of\nflux vacua of type II supergravity and M-theory are given on manifolds with\nSU(4)-structure. The N= (1,1) type IIA vacua uplift to N=1 M-theory vacua, with\nfour-flux that need not be (2,2) and primitive. Explicit vacua are given on\nStenzel space, a non-compact Calabi-Yau. These are then generalised by\nconstructing families of non-CY SU(4)-structures to find vacua on\nnon-symplectic SU(4)-deformed Stenzel spaces. It is shown that the\nsupersymmetry conditions for N = (2,0) type IIB can be rephrased in the\nlanguage of generalised complex geometry, partially in terms of integrability\nconditions of generalised almost complex structures. This rephrasing for d=2\ngoes beyond the calibration equations, in contrast to d=4,6 where the\ncalibration equations are equivalent to supersymmetry. Finally, Euclidean type\nII theory is examined on SU(5)-structure manifolds, where generalised equations\nare found which are necessary but not sufficient to satisfy the supersymmetry\nequations. Explicit classes of solutions are provided here as well. Contact\nwith Lorentzian physics can be made by uplifting such solutions to d=1, N=1\nM-theory.\n", "  We analyse the stochastic properties of the 49 pulsars that comprise the\nfirst International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) data release. We use Bayesian\nmethodology, performing model selection to determine the optimal description of\nthe stochastic signals present in each pulsar. In addition to spin-noise and\ndispersion-measure (DM) variations, these models can include timing noise\nunique to a single observing system, or frequency band. We show the improved\nradio-frequency coverage and presence of overlapping data from different\nobserving systems in the IPTA data set enables us to separate both system and\nband-dependent effects with much greater efficacy than in the individual PTA\ndata sets. For example, we show that PSR J1643$-$1224 has, in addition to DM\nvariations, significant band-dependent noise that is coherent between PTAs\nwhich we interpret as coming from time-variable scattering or refraction in the\nionised interstellar medium. Failing to model these different contributions\nappropriately can dramatically alter the astrophysical interpretation of the\nstochastic signals observed in the residuals. In some cases, the spectral\nexponent of the spin noise signal can vary from 1.6 to 4 depending upon the\nmodel, which has direct implications for the long-term sensitivity of the\npulsar to a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background. By using a more\nappropriate model, however, we can greatly improve a pulsar's sensitivity to\nGWs. For example, including system and band-dependent signals in the PSR\nJ0437$-$4715 data set improves the upper limit on a fiducial GW background by\n$\\sim 60\\%$ compared to a model that includes DM variations and spin-noise\nonly.\n", "  We present the results of a high-resolution, 5 GHz, Karl G. Jansky Very Large\nArray study of the nuclear radio emission in a representative subset of the\nAtlas3D survey of early-type galaxies (ETGs). We find that 51 +/- 4% of the\nETGs in our sample contain nuclear radio emission with luminosities as low as\n10^18 W/Hz. Most of the nuclear radio sources have compact (< 25-110 pc)\nmorphologies, although < 10% display multi-component core+jet or extended\njet/lobe structures. Based on the radio continuum properties, as well as\noptical emission line diagnostics and the nuclear X-ray properties, we conclude\nthat the majority of the central 5 GHz sources detected in the Atlas3D galaxies\nare associated with the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). However,\neven at sub-arcsecond spatial resolution, the nuclear radio emission in some\ncases appears to arise from low-level nuclear star formation rather than an\nAGN, particularly when molecular gas and a young central stellar population is\npresent. This is in contrast to popular assumptions in the literature that the\npresence of a compact, unresolved, nuclear radio continuum source universally\nsignifies the presence of an AGN. Additionally, we examine the relationships\nbetween the 5 GHz luminosity and various galaxy properties including the\nmolecular gas mass and - for the first time - the global kinematic state. We\ndiscuss implications for the growth, triggering, and fueling of radio AGNs, as\nwell as AGN-driven feedback in the continued evolution of nearby ETGs.\n", "  We explored the AllWISE catalogue of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer\nmission and identified Young Stellar Object candidates. Reliable 2MASS and WISE\nphotometric data combined with Planck dust opacity values were used to build\nour dataset and to find the best classification scheme. A sophisticated\nstatistical method, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to analyse the\nmulti-dimensional data space and to remove source types identified as\ncontaminants (extragalactic sources, main sequence stars, evolved stars and\nsources related to the interstellar medium). Objects listed in the SIMBAD\ndatabase are used to identify the already known sources and to train our\nmethod. A new all-sky selection of 133,980 Class I/II YSO candidates is\npresented. The estimated contamination was found to be well below 1% based on\ncomparison with our SIMBAD training set. We also compare our results to that of\nexisting methods and catalogues. The SVM selection process successfully\nidentified >90% of the Class I/II YSOs based on comparison with photometric and\nspectroscopic YSO catalogues. Our conclusion is that by using the SVM, our\nclassification is able to identify more known YSOs of the training sample than\nother methods based on colour-colour and magnitude-colour selection. The\ndistribution of the YSO candidates well correlates with that of the Planck\nGalactic Cold Clumps in the Taurus--Auriga--Perseus--California region.\n", "  We use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics to explore the circumstances under\nwhich an isolated very-low-mass prestellar core can be formed by colliding\nturbulent flows and collapse to form a brown-dwarf. Our simulations suggest\nthat the flows need not be very fast, but do need to be very strongly\nconvergent, i.e. the gas must flow in at comparable speeds from all sides,\nwhich seems rather unlikely. We therefore revisit the object Oph-B11, which\nAndre, Ward-Thompson and Greaves (2012) have identified as a prestellar core\nwith mass between $\\sim 0.020\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ and $\\sim\n0.030\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$. We reanalyse the observations using a Markov-chain\nMonte Carlo method that allows us (i) to include the uncertainties on the\ndistance, temperature and dust mass opacity, and (ii) to consider different\nBayesian prior distributions of the mass. We estimate that the posterior\nprobability that Oph-B11 has a mass below the hydrogen burning limit at $\\sim\n0.075\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$, is between 0.66 and 0.86. We conclude that, if\nOph-B11 is destined to collapse, it probably will form a brown dwarf. However,\nthe flows required to trigger this appear to be so contrived that it is\ndifficult to envisage this being the only way, or even a major way, of forming\nisolated brown dwarfs. Moreover, Oph-B11 could easily be a transient, bouncing,\nprolate core, seen end-on; there could, indeed should, be many such objects\nmasquerading as very low-mass prestellar cores.\n", "  We present results from the spectral fitting of the candidate black hole\nX-ray binary Swift J1753.5-0127 in an accretion state previously unseen in this\nsource. We fit the 0.7-78 keV spectrum with a number of models, however the\npreferred model is one of a multi-temperature disk with an inner disk\ntemperature $\\mathrm{k}T_\\mathrm{in}=0.252\\pm0.003$ keV scattered into a steep\npower-law with photon index $\\Gamma=6.39^{+0.08}_{-0.02}$ and an additional\nhard power law tail ($\\Gamma=1.79\\pm0.02$). We report on the emergence of a\nstrong disk-dominated component in the X-ray spectrum and we conclude that the\nsource has entered the soft state for the first time in its ~10 year prolonged\noutburst. Using reasonable estimates for the distance to the source ($3$ kpc)\nand black hole mass ($5M_{\\odot}$), we find the unabsorbed luminosity (0.1-100\nkeV) to be $\\approx0.60$% of the Eddington luminosity, making this one of the\nlowest luminosity soft states recorded in X-ray binaries. We also find that the\naccretion disk extended towards the compact object during its transition from\nhard to soft, with the inner radius estimated to be\n$R_{\\mathrm{in}}=28.0^{+0.7}_{-0.4} R_g$ or ~$12R_g$, dependent on the boundary\ncondition chosen, assuming the above distance and mass, a spectral hardening\nfactor $f=1.7$ and a binary inclination $i=55^{\\circ}$.\n", "  Some interacting supernovae (SNe) of type IIn show a sizeable continuum\npolarisation suggestive of a large scale asymmetry in the circumstellar medium\n(CSM) and/or the SN ejecta. Here, we extend the recent work of Dessart et al.\non super-luminous SNe IIn and perform axially-symmetric (i.e., 2D) multi-group\nradiation hydrodynamics simulations to explore the impact of an imposed large\nscale density asymmetry. When the CSM is asymmetric, the latitudinal variation\nof the radial optical depth $\\tau$ introduces a strong flux redistribution from\nthe higher-density CSM regions, where the shock luminosity is larger, towards\nthe lower-density CSM regions where photons escape more freely --- this\nredistribution ceases when $\\tau<$1. Along directions where the CSM density is\nlarger, the shock deceleration is stronger and its progression slower,\nproducing a non-spherical cold-dense shell (CDS). For an oblate CSM density\ndistribution, the photosphere (CDS) has an oblate (prolate) morphology when\n$\\tau>$1. When the CSM is symmetric and the ejecta asymmetric, the flux\nredistribution within the CSM now tends to damp the latitudinal variation of\nthe luminosity at the shock. It then requires a larger ejecta asymmetry to\nproduce a sizeable latitudinal variation in the emergent flux. When the\ninteraction is between a SN ejecta and a relic disk, the luminosity boost at\nearly times scales with the disk opening angle -- forming a super-luminous SN\nIIn this way requires an unrealistically thick disk. In contrast, interaction\nwith a disk of modest thickness/mass can yield a power that rivals radioactive\ndecay of a standard SN II at nebular times.\n", "  Luminous Blue Variables have been suggested to be the direct progenitors of\nsupernova types IIb and IIn, with enhanced mass loss prior to explosion.\nHowever, the mechanism of this mass loss is not yet known. Here, we investigate\nthe qualitative behaviour of theoretical stellar wind mass-loss as a function\nof Teff across two bi-stability jumps in blue supergiant regime and also in\nproximity to the Eddington limit, relevant for LBVs. To investigate the\nphysical ingredients that play a role in the radiative acceleration we\ncalculate blue supergiant wind models with the CMFGEN non-LTE model atmosphere\ncode over an effective temperature range between 30000 and 8800 K. Although our\naim is not to provide new mass-loss rates for BA supergiants, we study and\nconfirm the existence of two bi-stability jumps in mass-loss rates predicted by\nVink, de Koter, & Lamers (1999). However, they are found to occur at somewhat\nlower Teff (20000 and 9000 K, respectively) than found previously, which would\nimply that stars may evolve towards lower Teff before strong mass-loss is\ninduced by the bi-stability jumps. When the combined effects of the second\nbi-stability jump and the proximity to Eddington limit are accounted for, we\nfind a dramatic increase in the mass-loss rate by up to a factor of 30. Further\ninvestigation of both bi-stability jumps is expected to lead to a better\nunderstanding of discrepancies between empirical modelling and theoretical\nmass-loss rates reported in the literature, and to provide key inputs for the\nevolution of both normal AB supergiants and LBVs, as well as their subsequent\nsupernova type II explosions.\n", "  In this work we present a method to extract the signal induced by the\nintegrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect in the cosmic microwave background (CMB).\nIt makes use of the Linear Covariance-Based filter introduced by Barreiro et\nal., and combines CMB data with any number of large-scale structure (LSS)\nsurveys and lensing information. It also exploits CMB polarization to reduce\ncosmic variance. The performance of the method has been thoroughly tested with\nsimulations taking into account the impact of non-ideal conditions such as\nincomplete sky coverage or the presence of noise. In particular, three galaxy\nsurveys are simulated, whose redshift distributions peak at low ($z \\simeq\n0.3$), intermediate ($z \\simeq 0.6$) and high redshift ($z \\simeq 0.9$). The\ncontribution of each of the considered data sets as well as the effect of a\nmask and noise in the reconstructed ISW map is studied in detail. When\ncombining all the considered data sets (CMB temperature and polarization, the\nthree galaxy surveys and the lensing map), the proposed filter successfully\nreconstructs a map of the weak ISW signal, finding a perfect correlation with\nthe input signal for the ideal case and around 80 per cent, on average, in the\npresence of noise and incomplete sky coverage. We find that including CMB\npolarization improves the correlation between input and reconstruction although\nonly at a small level. Nonetheless, given the weakness of the ISW signal, even\nmodest improvements can be of importance. In particular, in realistic\nsituations, in which less information is available from the LSS tracers, the\neffect of including polarisation is larger. For instance, for the case in which\nthe ISW signal is recovered from CMB plus only one survey, and taking into\naccount the presence of noise and incomplete sky coverage, the improvement in\nthe correlation coefficient can be as large as 10 per cent.\n", "  We present optical integral field spectroscopy of the inner $2.5 \\times 3.4$\nkpc$^2$ of the broad-line radio galaxy Pictor A, at a spatial resolution of\n$\\approx 400$ pc. Line emission is observed over the whole field-of-view, being\nstrongest at the nucleus and in an elongated linear feature (ELF) crossing the\nnucleus from the south-west to the north-east along PA $\\sim 70^\\circ$.\nAlthough the broad double-peaked H$\\alpha$ line and the [OI]6300/H$\\alpha$ and\n[SII]6717+31/H$\\alpha$ ratios are typical of AGNs, the [NII]6584/H$\\alpha$\nratio (0.15 - 0.25) is unusually low. We suggest that this is due to the\nunusually low metallicity of the gas. Centroid velocity maps show mostly\nblueshifts to the south and redshifts to the north of the nucleus, but the\nvelocity field is not well fitted by a rotation model. Velocity dispersions are\nlow (< 100 km s$^{-1}$) along the ELF, ruling out a jet-cloud interaction as\nthe origin of this structure. The ELF shows both blueshifts and redshifts in\nchannel maps, suggesting that it is close to the plane of the sky. The ELF is\nevidently photoionized by the AGN, but its kinematics and inferred low\nmetallicity suggest that this structure may have originated in a past merger\nevent with another galaxy. We suggest that the gas acquired in this interaction\nmay be feeding the ELF.\n", "  We report the discovery of a radio halo in the massive merging cluster\nMACSJ2243.3-0935, as well as a new radio relic candidate, using the Giant\nMeterwave Radio Telescope and the KAT-7 telescope. The radio halo is coincident\nwith the cluster X-ray emission and has a largest linear scale of approximately\n0.9 Mpc. We measure a flux density of $10.0\\pm 2.0$ mJy at 610 MHz for the\nradio halo. We discuss equipartition estimates of the cluster magnetic field\nand constrain the value to be of the order of 1 $\\mu$G. The relic candidate is\ndetected at the cluster virial radius where a filament meets the cluster. The\nrelic candidate has a flux density of $5.2\\pm 0.8$ mJy at 610 MHz. We discuss\npossible origins of the relic candidate emission and conclude that the\ncandidate is consistent with an infall relic.\n", "  We present ALMA observations of the CO(1-0) and CO(3-2) line emission tracing\nfilaments of cold molecular gas in the central galaxy of the cluster\nPKS0745-191. The total molecular gas mass of 4.6 +/- 0.3 x 10^9 solar masses,\nassuming a Galactic X_{CO} factor, is divided roughly equally between three\nfilaments each extending radially 3-5 kpc from the galaxy centre. The emission\npeak is located in the SE filament roughly 1 arcsec (2 kpc) from the nucleus.\nThe velocities of the molecular clouds in the filaments are low, lying within\n+/-100 km/s of the galaxy's systemic velocity. Their FWHMs are less than 150\nkm/s, which is significantly below the stellar velocity dispersion. Although\nthe molecular mass of each filament is comparable to a rich spiral galaxy, such\nlow velocities show that the filaments are transient and the clouds would\ndisperse on <10^7 yr timescales unless supported, likely by the indirect effect\nof magnetic fields. The velocity structure is inconsistent with a merger origin\nor gravitational free-fall of cooling gas in this massive central galaxy. If\nthe molecular clouds originated in gas cooling even a few kpc from their\ncurrent locations their velocities would exceed those observed. Instead, the\nprojection of the N and SE filaments underneath X-ray cavities suggests they\nformed in the updraft behind bubbles buoyantly rising through the cluster\natmosphere. Direct uplift of the dense gas by the radio bubbles appears to\nrequire an implausibly high coupling efficiency. The filaments are coincident\nwith low temperature X-ray gas, bright optical line emission and dust lanes\nindicating that the molecular gas could have formed from lifted warmer gas that\ncooled in situ.\n", "  Three groups of DAV star models are evolved with time-dependent element\ndiffusion by \\texttt{WDEC}. The core compositions of these models are directly\nfrom white dwarf models evolved by \\texttt{MESA}, which are results of\nthermonuclear burning. Based on these DAV star models, we try to study the\ndispersion of period spacing. The thickness of hydrogen atmosphere can\nseriously affect the deviation degree of minimal period spacings. The minimal\nperiod spacings dominate the dispersion of period spacing. The thinner the\nhydrogen atmosphere, basically, the more dispersive the period spacing.\nStandard deviations are used to analyze the dispersion of period spacing.\nStudying the dispersion of period spacing on a DAV star KUV03442+0719\npreliminarily, we suggest that log($M_{\\rm H}/M_{*}$) is from -8.5 to -5.5. In\naddition, modes partly trapped in C/O core are found based on those DAV star\nmodels. The identified modes and average period spacings indicate that\nKUV03442+0719 may be the first star to 'observe' modes partly trapped in C/O\ncore.\n", "  We present 1.3mm Submillimeter Array (SMA) observations at\n$\\sim$3$^{\\prime\\prime}$ resolution towards the brightest section of the\nintermediate/massive star forming cluster NGC 2264-C. The millimetre continuum\nemission reveals ten 1.3mm continuum peaks, of which four are new detections.\nThe observed frequency range includes the known molecular jet/outflow tracer\nSiO (5-4), thus providing the first high resolution observations of SiO towards\nNGC 2264-C. We also detect molecular lines of twelve additional species towards\nthis region, including CH$_3$CN, CH$_3$OH, SO, H$_2$CO, DCN, HC$_3$N, and\n$^{12}$CO. The SiO (5-4) emission reveals the presence of two collimated, high\nvelocity (up to 30kms$^{-1}$ with respect to the systemic velocity) bi-polar\noutflows in NGC 2264-C. In addition, the outflows are traced by emission from\n$^{12}$CO, SO, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH. We find an evolutionary spread between\ncores residing in the same parent cloud. The two unambiguous outflows are\ndriven by the brightest mm continuum cores, which are IR-dark, molecular line\nweak, and likely the youngest cores in the region. Furthermore, towards the RMS\nsource AFGL 989-IRS1, the IR-bright and most evolved source in NGC 2264-C, we\nobserve no molecular outflow emission. A molecular line rich ridge feature,\nwith no obvious directly associated continuum source, lies on the edge of a low\ndensity cavity and may be formed from a wind driven by AFGL 989-IRS1. In\naddition, 229GHz class I maser emission is detected towards this feature.\n", "  We present 1-D non-Local-Thermodynamic-Equilibrium time-dependent\nradiative-transfer simulations for a large grid of supernovae (SNe) IIb/Ib/Ic\nthat result from the terminal explosion of the mass donor in a close-binary\nsystem. Our sample covers ejecta masses $M_{\\rm e}$ of 1.7$-$5.2M$_\\odot$,\nkinetic energies $E_{\\rm kin}$ of 0.6$-$5.0$\\times$10$^{51}$erg, and $^{56}$Ni\nmasses of 0.05$-$0.30M$_\\odot$. We find a strong correlation between the\n$^{56}$Ni mass and the photometric properties at maximum, and between the rise\ntime to bolometric maximum and the post-maximum decline rate. We confirm the\nsmall scatter in ($V-R$) at 10d past $R$-band maximum. The quantity $V_{\\rm m}\n\\equiv \\sqrt{2E_{\\rm kin}/M_{\\rm e}}$ is comparable to the Doppler velocity\nmeasured from HeI 5875\\AA\\ at maximum in SNe IIb/Ib, although some scatter\narises from the uncertain level of chemical mixing. The OI7772\\AA\\ line may be\nused for SNe Ic, but the correspondence deteriorates with higher ejecta\nmass/energy. We identify a temporal reversal of the Doppler velocity at maximum\nabsorption in the $\\sim$1.05$\\mu$m feature in all models. The reversal is due\nto HeI alone and could serve as a test for the presence of helium in SNe Ic.\nBecause of variations in composition and ionisation, the ejecta opacity shows\nsubstantial variations with both velocity and time. This is in part the origin\nof the offset between our model light curves and the predictions from the\nArnett model.\n", "  HectoMAP is a dense redshift survey of red galaxies covering a 53 $deg^{2}$\nstrip of the northern sky. HectoMAP is 97\\% complete for galaxies with\n$r<20.5$, $(g-r)>1.0$, and $(r-i)>0.5$. The survey enables tests of the\nphysical properties of large-scale structure at intermediate redshift against\ncosmological models. We use the Horizon Run 4, one of the densest and largest\ncosmological simulations based on the standard $\\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter\n($\\Lambda$CDM) model, to compare the physical properties of observed\nlarge-scale structures with simulated ones in a volume-limited sample covering\n8$\\times10^6$ $h^{-3}$ Mpc$^3$ in the redshift range $0.22<z<0.44$. We apply\nthe same criteria to the observations and simulations to identify over- and\nunder-dense large-scale features of the galaxy distribution. The richness and\nsize distributions of observed over-dense structures agree well with the\nsimulated ones. Observations and simulations also agree for the volume and size\ndistributions of under-dense structures, voids. The properties of the largest\nover-dense structure and the largest void in HectoMAP are well within the\ndistributions for the largest structures drawn from 300 Horizon Run 4 mock\nsurveys. Overall the size, richness and volume distributions of observed\nlarge-scale structures in the redshift range $0.22<z<0.44$ are remarkably\nconsistent with predictions of the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n", "  [GKH94] 41 and IRAS 04191+1523B were previously identified to be proto-brown\ndwarf candidates in Taurus. [GKH94] 41 was classified to be a class I object.\nThe dereddened spectral energy distribution of the source was later found to be\nsuggestive of a class II object. IRAS 04191+1523B is a class I object that is\nthe secondary component of a binary. We determine the evolutionary stage of\n[GKH94] 41 and estimate the final masses of the two proto-brown dwarf\ncandidates. We used archive millimeter observations to produce continuum maps\nand collected data from the literature to construct the spectral energy\ndistribution of the targets. Our continuum maps revealed that both [GKH94] 41\nand IRAS 04191+1523B are surrounded by envelopes. This provides direct evidence\nthat [GKH94] 41 is a class I object, not class II, as previously classified.\nFor IRAS 04191+1523B, our continuum map spatially resolved the binary. Our\nestimated final masses are below 49$^{+56}_{-27}$ $M_{\\rm J}$ and\n75$^{+40}_{-26}$ $M_{\\rm J}$ for [GKH94] 41 and IRAS 04191+1523B, respectively.\nThis indicates that both sources will likely become brown dwarfs or very\nlow-mass stars. Therefore, [GKH94] 41 and IRAS 04191+1523B are two new\nconfirmed class I very low-mass objects. Their existence also supports the\nscenario that brown dwarfs have the same formation stages as low-mass stars.\n", "  Gamow-Teller transitions in isotopes of chromium play a consequential role in\nthe presupernova evolution of massive stars. $\\beta$-decay and electron capture\nrates on chromium isotopes significantly affect the time rate of change of\nlepton fraction ($\\dot{Y_{e}}$). Fine-tuning of this parameter is one of the\nkey for simulating a successful supernova explosion. The (anti)neutrinos\nproduced as a result of electron capture and $\\beta$-decay are transparent to\nstellar matter during presupernova phases. They carry away energy and this\nresult in cooling the stellar core. In this paper we present the calculations\nof Gamow-Teller strength distributions and (anti)neutrino energy loss rates due\nto weak interactions on chromium isotopes of astrophysical importance. We\ncompare our results with measured data and previous calculations wherever\navailable.\n", "  Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) are generally considered to originate\nfrom the massive collapsars. It is believed that the central engine of\ngamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is a neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) around a\nrotating stellar-mass black hole (BH). The neutrino annihilation above the NDAF\nis a feasible mechanism to power GRB. In this work, we analyse the\ndistributions of the isotropic gamma-ray radiated energy and jet kinetic energy\nof 48 LGRBs. According to the NDAF and fireball models, we estimate the mean\naccreted masses of LGRBs in our sample to investigate whether the NDAFs can\npower LGRBs with the reasonable BH parameters and conversion efficiency of\nneutrino annihilation. The results indicate that most of the values of the\naccreted masses are less than $5~M_\\odot$ for the extreme Kerr BHs and high\nconversion efficiency. It suggests that the NDAFs may be suitable for most of\nLGRBs except for some extremely high energy sources.\n", "  A readout electronic with high time and energy resolution performance is\ndesigned for the SDD (Silicon Drift Detector) signals readout, which is aimed\nfor X-ray pulsar based navigation (XNAV). For time measurement, the input\nsignal is fed into a fast shaping and Constant Fraction Discrimination (CFD)\ncircuit, and then be digitalized by a Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC)\nimplemented in an Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), which is designed with\na bin size of 2.5 ns. For energy measurement, a slow shaping and analog peak\ndetection circuit is employed to acquire the energy information of input\nsignals, which is then digitalized by a 14-bit Analog-to-Digital Converter\n(ADC). Both the time and energy measurement results are buffered and packaged\nin FPGA and then transmitted to Data Processing (DP) system. Test results\nindicate that the time resolution is about 3 ns, while the FWHM (Full Width at\nHalf Maximum) of energy spectrum is better than 160 eV @ 5.9 keV, with the\nenergy dynamic range from 1 keV to 10 keV. Meanwhile, the linearity test shows\nthat the residual is less than 1.5% with different coming photons.\n", "  Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) are cold, dense regions that are usually found\nwithin Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs). Ongoing star formation within IRDCs is\ntypically still deeply embedded within the surrounding molecular gas.\nCharacterising the properties of relatively quiescent IRDCs may therefore help\nus to understand the earliest phases of the star formation process. Studies of\nlocal molecular clouds have revealed that deuterated species are enhanced in\nthe earliest phases of star formation. In this paper we test this towards IRDC\nG035.39-00.33. We present an 80 arcsec by 140 arcsec map of the J=2-1\ntransition of N2D+, obtained with the IRAM-30m telescope. We find that N2D+ is\nwidespread throughout G035.39-00.33. Complementary observations of N2H+(1-0)\nare used to estimate the deuterium fraction, N(N2D+)/N(N2H+). We report a mean\ndeuterium fraction of 0.04+-0.01, with a maximum of 0.09+-0.02. The mean\ndeuterium fraction is ~3 orders of magnitude greater than the interstellar\n[D]/[H] ratio. High angular resolution observations are required to exclude\nbeam dilution effects of compact deuterated cores. Using chemical modelling, we\nfind that the average observed values of the deuterium fraction are in\nagreement with an equilibrium deuterium fraction, given the general properties\nof the cloud. This implies that the IRDC is at least ~3Myr old, which is ~8\ntimes longer than the mean free-fall time of the observed deuterated region.\n", "  The acceleration and energy dissipation terms due to the shear viscosity have\nbeen implemented and tested in GodunovSPH. The double summation method has been\nemployed to avoid the well known numerical noise of the second derivative in\nparticle based codes. The plane Couette flow with various initial and boundary\nconditions have been used as tests, and the numerical and analytical results\nshow a good agreement. Not only the viscosity--only calculation, but the full\nhydrodynamics simulations have been performed, and they show expected results\nas well. The very low kinematic viscosity simulations show a turbulent pattern\nwhen the Reynolds number exceeds $\\sim$$10^2$. The critical value of the\nReynolds number at the transition point of the laminar and turbulent flows\ncoincides with the previous works approximately. A smoothed dynamic viscosity\nhas been suggested to describe the individual kinematic viscosity of particles.\nThe infinitely extended Couette flow which has two layers of different\nviscosities has been simulated to check the smoothed dynamic viscosity, and the\nresult agrees well with the analytic solution. In order to compare the standard\nSPH and GodunovSPH, the two layers test has been performed again with a density\ncontrast. GodunovSPH shows less dispersion than the standard SPH, but there is\nno significant difference in the results. The results of the viscous ring\nevolution has also been presented as well, and the numerical results agrees\nwith the analytic solution.\n", "  Early detection and modeling of a contagious epidemic can provide important\nguidance about quelling the contagion, controlling its spread, or the effective\ndesign of countermeasures. A topic of recent interest has been to design social\nnetwork sensors, i.e., identifying a small set of people who can be monitored\nto provide insight into the emergence of an epidemic in a larger population. We\nformally pose the problem of designing social network sensors for flu epidemics\nand identify two different objectives that could be targeted in such sensor\ndesign problems. Using the graph theoretic notion of dominators we develop an\nefficient and effective heuristic for forecasting epidemics at lead time. Using\nsix city-scale datasets generated by extensive microscopic epidemiological\nsimulations involving millions of individuals, we illustrate the practical\napplicability of our methods and show significant benefits (up to twenty-two\ndays more lead time) compared to other competitors. Most importantly, we\ndemonstrate the use of surrogates or proxies for policy makers for designing\nsocial network sensors that require from nonintrusive knowledge of people to\nmore information on the relationship among people. The results show that the\nmore intrusive information we obtain, the longer lead time to predict the flu\noutbreak up to nine days.\n", "  Dust grains play a key role in the physics of star-forming regions, even\nthough they constitute only $\\sim$1 % of the mass of the interstellar medium.\nThe derivation of accurate dust parameters such as temperature ($T_{dust}$),\nemissivity spectral index ($\\beta$) and column density requires broadband\ncontinuum observations at far-infrared wavelengths. We present Herschel-SPIRE\nFourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) measurements of three starless cores:\nL1521E, L1521F and L1689B, covering wavelengths between 194 and 671 $\\mu$m.\nThis paper is the first to use our recently updated SPIRE-FTS intensity\ncalibration, yielding a direct match with SPIRE photometer measurements of\nextended sources. In addition, we carefully assess the validity of calibration\nschemes depending on source extent and on the strength of background emission.\nThe broadband far-infrared spectra for all three sources peak near 250 $\\mu$m.\nOur observations therefore provide much tighter constraints on the spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) shape than measurements that do not probe the SED\npeak. The spectra are fitted using modified blackbody functions, allowing both\n$T_{dust}$ and $\\beta$ to vary as free parameters. This yields $T_{dust}$ of\n9.8$\\pm$0.2 K, 15.6$\\pm$0.5 K and 10.9$\\pm$0.2 K and corresponding $\\beta$ of\n2.6$\\mp$0.9, 0.8$\\mp$0.1 and 2.4$\\mp$0.8 for L1521E, L1521F and L1689B\nrespectively. The derived core masses are 1.0$\\pm$0.1, 0.10$\\pm$0.01 and\n0.49$\\pm$0.05 $M_{\\odot}$, respectively. The core mass/Jeans mass ratios for\nL1521E and L1689B exceed unity indicating that they are unstable to\ngravitational collapse, and thus pre-stellar cores. By comparison, the elevated\ntemperature and gravitational stability of L1521F support previous arguments\nthat this source is more evolved and likely a protostar.\n", "  We present a new deep spectroscopic catalogue for Abell 85, within 3.0\n$\\times$ 2.6 Mpc$^2$ and down to $M_{r} \\sim M_{r}^* +6$. Using the Visible\nMulti-Object Spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope (VIMOS@VLT) and the\nAutoFiber 2 at the William Herschel Telescope (AF2@WHT), we obtained almost\n1,430 new redshifts for galaxies with $m_r \\leq 21$ mag and $\\langle \\mu_{e,r}\n\\rangle \\leq 24$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. These redshifts, together with SDSS-DR6 and\nNED spectroscopic information, result in 460 confirmed cluster members. This\ndataset allows the study of the luminosity function (LF) of the cluster\ngalaxies covering three orders of magnitudes in luminosities. The total and\nradial LFs are best modelled by a double Schechter function. The normalized LFs\nshow that their bright ($M_{r} \\leq -21.5$) and faint ($M_{r}\\geq -18.0$) ends\nare independent of clustercentric distance and similar to the field LFs unlike\nthe intermediate luminosity range ($-21.5 \\leq M_{r} \\leq -18.0$). Similar\nresults are found for the LFs of the dominant types of galaxies: red, passive,\nvirialized and early-infall members. On the contrary, the LFs of blue, star\nforming, non-virialized and recent-infall galaxies are well described by a\nsingle Schechter function. These populations contribute to a small fraction of\nthe galaxy density in the innermost cluster region. However, in the outskirts\nof the cluster, they have similar densities to red, passive, virialized and\nearly-infall members at the LF faint end. These results confirm a clear\ndependence of the colour and star formation of Abell 85 members in the cluster\ncentric distance.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the phase transitions and critical behaviors of\nthe frustrated J1-J2-J3 Ising model on the square lattice using Monte Carlo\nsimulations, and particular attention goes to the effect of the second next\nnearest neighbor interaction J3 on the phase transition from a disordered state\nto the single stripe antiferromagnetic state. A continuous Ashkin-Teller-like\ntransition behavior in a certain range of J3 is identified, while the 4-state\nPotts-critical end point [J3/J1]C is estimated based on the analytic method\nreported in earlier work [Jin et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 045702 (2012)]. It\nis suggested that the interaction J3 can tune the transition temperature and in\nturn modulate the critical behaviors of the frustrated model. Furthermore, it\nis revealed that an antiferromagnetic J3 can stabilize the staggered dimer\nstate via a phase transition of strong first-order character.\n", "  We use smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the growth\nof perturbations in infinitely long, initially sub-critical but accreting\nfilaments. The growth of these perturbations leads to filament fragmentation\nand the formation of cores. Most previous work on this subject has been\nconfined to the growth and fragmentation of equilibrium filaments and has found\nthat there exists a preferential fragmentation length scale which is roughly 4\ntimes the filament's diameter. Our results show a more complicated dispersion\nrelation with a series of peaks linking perturbation wavelength and growth\nrate. These are due to gravo-acoustic oscillations along the longitudinal axis\nduring the sub-critical phase of growth. The positions of the peaks in growth\nrate have a strong dependence on both the mass accretion rate onto the filament\nand the temperature of the gas. When seeded with a multi-wavelength density\npower spectrum there exists a clear preferred core separation equal to the\nlargest peak in the dispersion relation. Our results allow one to estimate a\nminimum age for a filament which is breaking up into regularly spaced\nfragments, as well as a maximum accretion rate. We apply the model to\nobservations of filaments in Taurus by Tafalla & Hacar (2015) and find\naccretion rates consistent with those estimated by Palmeirim et al. (2013).\n", "  We revisit the velocity-dependent one-scale model for topological defect\nevolution, and present a new alternative formulation in terms of a physical\n(rather than invariant) characteristic length scale. While the two approaches\nare equivalent (as we explicitly demonstrate), the new one is particularly\nrelevant when studying the evolution of ultra-relativistic defects. Moreover, a\ncomparison of the two provides further insight on the interpretation of the\nmodel's two phenomenological parameters, $c$ related to energy losses and $k$\nrelated to the curvature of the defects. As an illustration of the relevance of\nthe new formulation, we use it to study the evolution of cosmic string and\ndomain wall networks in contracting universes. We show that these networks are\nultra-relativistic and conformally contracted, with the physical length scale\nbehaving as $L_{ph}\\propto a$ and the density as $\\rho\\propto a^{-4}$ (as in a\nradiation fluid) in both cases. On the other hand the velocity and invariant\nlength respectively behave as $(\\gamma v)\\propto a^{-n}$ and $L_{inv}\\propto\na^{\\frac{4}{4-n}}$, where $n$ is the number of dimensions of the defect's\nworldsheet. Finally we also study an alternative friction-dominated scenario\nand show that the stretching and Kibble regimes identified in the case of\nexpanding universes can also occur for contracting ones.\n", "  2-Dimensional (2D) CrPS4 single crystals have been grown by the chemical\nvapor transport method. The crystallographic, magnetic, electronic and thermal\ntransport properties of the single crystals were investigated by the\nroom-temperature X-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity \\r{ho}(T), specific\nheat CP(T) and the electronic spin response (ESR) measurements. CrPS4 crystals\ncrystallize into a monoclinic structure. The electrical resistivity \\r{ho}(T)\nshows a semiconducting behavior with an energy gap Ea=0.166 eV. The\nantiferromagntic (AFM) transition temperature is about TN=36 K. The spin\nflipping induced by the applied magnetic field is observed along the c axis.\nThe magnetic phase diagram of CrPS4 single crystal has been discussed. The\nextracted magnetic entropy at TN is about 10.8 J/mol K, which is consistent\nwith the theoretical value R ln(2S + 1) for S = 3/2 of the Cr3+ ion. Based on\nthe mean-field theory, the magnetic exchange constants J1 and Jc corresponding\nto the interactions of the intralayer and between layers are about 0.143 meV\nand -0.955 meV are obtained based on the fitting of the susceptibility above\nTN, which agree with the results obtained from the ESR measurements. With the\nhelp of the strain for tuning the magnetic properties, monolayer CrPS4 may be a\npromising candidate to explore 2D magnetic semiconductors.\n", "  Using archival data from the 2008 Lick AGN Monitoring Project, Zhang & Feng\n(2016) claimed to find evidence for flux variations in the narrow [O III]\nemission of the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 142 over a two-month time span. If\ncorrect, this would imply a surprisingly compact size for the narrow-line\nregion. We show that the claimed [O III] variations are merely the result of\nrandom errors in the overall flux calibration of the spectra. The data do not\nprovide any support for the hypothesis that the [O III] flux was variable\nduring the 2008 monitoring period.\n", "  We aim at deriving accurate atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances of\n19 barium (Ba) stars, including both strong and mild Ba stars, based on the\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio and high resolution Echelle spectra obtained from\nthe 2.16 m telescope at Xinglong station of National Astronomical\nObservatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The chemical abundances of the\nsample stars were obtained from an LTE, plane-parallel and line-blanketed\natmospheric model by inputting the atmospheric parameters (effective\ntemperatures, surface gravities, metallicity and microturbulent velocity) and\nequivalent widths of stellar absorption lines. These samples of Ba stars are\ngiants indicated by atmospheric parameters, metallicities and kinematic\nanalysis about UVW velocity. Chemical abundances of 17 elements were obtained\nfor these Ba stars. Their light elements (O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr,\nMn and Ni) are similar to the solar abundances. Our samples of Ba stars show\nobvious overabundances of neutron-capture (n-capture) process elements relative\nto the Sun. Their median abundances of [Ba/Fe], [La/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] are 0.54,\n0.65 and 0.40, respectively. The YI and ZrI abundances are lower than Ba, La\nand Eu, but higher than the light elements for the strong Ba stars and similar\nto the iron-peak elements for the mild stars. There exists a positive\ncorrelation between Ba intensity and [Ba/Fe]. For the n-capture elements (Y,\nZr, Ba, La), there is an anti-correlation between their [X/Fe] and [Fe/H]. We\nidentify nine of our sample stars as strong Ba stars with [Ba/Fe]>0.6 where\nseven of them have Ba intensity Ba=2-5, one has Ba=1.5 and another one has\nBa=1.0. The remaining ten stars are classified as mild Ba stars with\n0.17<[Ba/Fe]<0.54.\n", "  The electron temperature dependent electron density of states, Fermi-Dirac\ndistribution, and electron-phonon spectral function are computed as\nprerequisites before achieving effective electron-phonon coupling factor. The\nobtained coupling factor is implemented into a molecular dynamics (MD) and\ntwo-temperature model (TTM) coupled simulation of femtosecond laser heating. By\nmonitoring temperature evolutions of electron and lattice subsystems, the\nresult utilizing coupling factor from ab initio calculation, shows a faster\ndecrease of electron temperature and increase of lattice temperature than those\nusing coupling factor from phenomenological treatment. The approach of\ncalculating coupling factor and its implementation into MD-TTM simulation is\napplicable to other metals.\n", "  The Fine Pixel CCD (FPCCD) is one of the candidate sensor technologies for\nthe ILC vertex detector. It will be located near interaction point and require\nhigh radiation tolerance. It will thus be operated at -40 degree C to improve\nradiation tolerance. In this paper, we report on the status of neutron\nradiation tests, on a cooling system using two-phase CO2 with a gas compressor\nfor circulation, and on the mechanical structure of the FPCCD ladders.\n", "  We present the data processing pipeline to generate calibrated data products\nfrom the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) imaging Fourier\nTransform Spectrometer on the Herschel Space Observatory. The pipeline\nprocesses telemetry from SPIRE observations and produces calibrated spectra for\nall resolution modes. The spectrometer pipeline shares some elements with the\nSPIRE photometer pipeline, including the conversion of telemetry packets into\ndata timelines and calculation of bolometer voltages. We present the following\nfundamental processing steps unique to the spectrometer: temporal and spatial\ninterpolation of the scan mechanism and detector data to create interferograms;\nFourier transformation; apodization; and creation of a data cube. We also\ndescribe the corrections for various instrumental effects including first- and\nsecond-level glitch identification and removal, correction of the effects due\nto emission from the Herschel telescope and from within the spectrometer\ninstrument, interferogram baseline correction, temporal and spatial phase\ncorrection, non-linear response of the bolometers, and variation of instrument\nperformance across the focal plane arrays. Astronomical calibration is based on\ncombinations of observations of standard astronomical sources and regions of\nspace known to contain minimal emission.\n", "  Based on the basic definition of Fermi energy of degenerate and relativistic\nelectrons, we obtain a special solution to electron Fermi energy, $E_{\\rm\nF}(e)$, and express $E_{\\rm F}(e)$ as a function of electron fraction, $Y_{e}$,\nand matter density, $\\rho$. Several useful analytical formulae for $Y_{e}$ and\n$\\rho$ within classical models and the work of Dutra et al. 2014 (Type-2) in\nrelativistic mean field theory are obtained using numerically fitting. When\ndescribing the mean-field Lagrangian, density, we adopt the TMA parameter set,\nwhich is remarkably consistent with with the updated astrophysical observations\nof neutron stars. Due to the importance of the density dependence of the\nsymmetry energy, $S$, in nuclear astrophysics, a brief discussion on the\nsymmetry parameters $S_v$ and $L$ (the slope of $S$) is presented. Combining\nthese fit formulae with boundary conditions for different density regions, we\ncan evaluate the value of $E_{\\rm F}(e)$ in any given matter density, and\nobtain a schematic diagram of $E_{\\rm F}(e)$ as a continuous function of\n$\\rho$. Compared with previous study on the electron Fermi energy in other\nmodels, our methods of calculating $E_{\\rm F}(e)$ are more simple and\nconvenient, and can be universally suitable for the relativistic electron\nregions in the circumstances of common neutron stars. We have deduced a general\nexpression of $E_{\\rm F}(e)$ and $n_{e}$, which could be used to indirectly\ntest whether one EoS of a NS is correct in our future studies on neutron star\nmatter properties. Since URCA reactions are expected in the center of a massive\nstar due to high-value electron Fermi energy and electron fraction, this study\ncould be useful in the future studies on the NS thermal evolution.\n", "  The solar modulation of galactic cosmic rays (GCR) can be studied in detail\nby examining long-term variations of the GCR energy spectrum (e.g. on the\nscales of a solar cycle). With almost 20 years of data, the Electron Proton\nHelium INstrument (EPHIN) onboard the SOlar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)\nis well suited for this kind of investigation. Although the design of the\ninstrument is optimized to measure proton and helium isotope spectra up to 50\nMeV nucleon$^{-1}$ , the capability exists to determine proton energy spectra\nfrom 250 MeV up to above 1.6 GeV. Therefore we developed a sophisticated\ninversion method to calculate such proton spectra. The method relies on a\nGEANT4 Monte Carlo simulation of the instrument and a simplified spacecraft\nmodel that calculates the energy-response function of EPHIN for electrons,\nprotons and heavier ions. For validation purposes, proton spectra based on this\nmethod are compared to various balloon missions and space instrumentation. As a\nresult we present annual galactic cosmic ray spectra from 1995 to 2014.\n", "  The grand-design face-on spiral galaxy NGC6946 is remarkable because of its\nhigh star formation activity, the massive northern spiral arm, and the magnetic\narms, which are observed in polarized radio synchrotron emission and are\nlocated between the optical arms and possibly are magnetic reconnection\nregions. X-ray observations of NGC6946 performed with XMM-Newton were used to\nstudy the emission from X-ray point sources and diffuse hot gas, including the\nmagnetic arms and the halo. Spectral fitting of the diffuse X-ray emission\nallowed us to derive temperatures of the hot gas. With assumptions about the\nemission volume, this allowed us to estimate gas densities, masses, and cooling\ntimes. To explain the X-ray emission from the spiral arms of NGC6946\ntwo-temperature plasma models are needed to account for the disk and halo\nemission. The interarm regions show only one thermal component. We observe that\nthe temperature of the hot gas in and above the magnetic arm regions increases\nslightly when compared to the average temperatures in the areas in and above\nthe spiral arms. For the southwestern part of the disk, which is depolarized in\nthe radio range by Faraday rotation, we find more efficient mixing of disk and\nhalo gas. We propose magnetic reconnection in the magnetic arm regions of\nNGC6946 as the possible cause of the additional heating of the gas and ordering\nof the magnetic fields. In the southwestern part of the galactic disk we\nobserved indications of a possible faster outflow of the hot gas. A very hot\ngas within the MF16 nebula possibly suggests shock heating by a supernova\nexplosion.\n", "  We discuss the coupling of the electromagnetic field with a curved and\ntorsioned Lyra manifold using the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau theory. We will show how\nto obtain the equations of motion and energy-momentum and spin density tensors\nby means of the Schwinger Variational Principle.\n", "  The quantum PCP (QPCP) conjecture states that all problems in QMA, the\nquantum analogue of NP, admit quantum verifiers that only act on a constant\nnumber of qubits of a polynomial size quantum proof and have a constant gap\nbetween completeness and soundness. Despite an impressive body of work trying\nto prove or disprove the quantum PCP conjecture, it still remains widely open.\nThe above-mentioned proof verification statement has also been shown equivalent\nto the QMA-completeness of the Local Hamiltonian problem with constant relative\ngap. Nevertheless, unlike in the classical case, no equivalent formulation in\nthe language of multi-prover games is known.\n  In this work, we propose a new type of quantum proof systems, the Pointer\nQPCP, where a verifier first accesses a classical proof that he can use as a\npointer to which qubits from the quantum part of the proof to access. We define\nthe Pointer QPCP conjecture, that states that all problems in QMA admit quantum\nverifiers that first access a logarithmic number of bits from the classical\npart of a polynomial size proof, then act on a constant number of qubits from\nthe quantum part of the proof, and have a constant gap between completeness and\nsoundness. We define a new QMA-complete problem, the Set Local Hamiltonian\nproblem, and a new restricted class of quantum multi-prover games, called CRESP\ngames. We use them to provide two other equivalent statements to the Pointer\nQPCP conjecture: the Set Local Hamiltonian problem with constant relative gap\nis QMA-complete; and the approximation of the maximum acceptance probability of\nCRESP games up to a constant additive factor is as hard as QMA. This is the\nfirst equivalence between a quantum PCP statement and the inapproximability of\nquantum multi-prover games.\n", "  Nonlinear ion-acoustic cnoidal wave structures are studied in an unmagnetized\nquantum plasma. Using the reductive perturbation method, a Korteweg-de Vries\nequation is derived for appropriate boundary conditions and nonlinear periodic\nwave solutions are obtained. The corresponding analytical solution and\nnumerical plots of the ion-acoustic cnoidal waves and solitons in the phase\nplane are presented using the Sagdeev pseudo-potential approach. The variations\nin the nonlinear potential of the ion-acoustic cnoidal waves are studied at\ndifferent values of quantum parameter $H_{e}$ which is the ratio of electron\nplasmon energy to electron Fermi energy defined for degenerate electrons. It is\nfound that both compressive and rarefactive ion-acoustic cnoidal wave\nstructures are formed depending on the value of the quantum parameter. The\ndependence of the wavelength and frequency on nonlinear wave amplitude is also\npresented.\n", "  Linear and nonlinear ion-acoustic waves are studied in a fluid model for\nnon-relativistic, unmagnetized quantum plasma with electrons with an arbitrary\ndegeneracy degree. The equation of state for electrons follows from a local\nFermi-Dirac distribution function and apply equally well both to fully\ndegenerate or classical, non-degenerate limits. Ions are assumed to be cold.\nQuantum diffraction effects through the Bohm potential are also taken into\naccount. A general coupling parameter valid for dilute and dense plasmas is\nproposed. The linear dispersion relation of the ion-acoustic waves is obtained\nand the ion-acoustic speed is discussed for the limiting cases of extremely\ndense or dilute systems. In the long wavelength limit the results agree with\nquantum kinetic theory. Using the reductive perturbation method, the\nappropriate Korteweg-de Vries equation for weakly nonlinear solutions is\nobtained and the corresponding soliton propagation is analyzed. It is found\nthat soliton hump and dip structures are formed depending on the value of the\nquantum parameter for the degenerate electrons, which affect the phase\nvelocities in the dispersive medium.\n", "  Simulations show for the first time how the magnetic fields that produce\nsolar flares can extend out of the Sun by acquiring a twist.\n", "  Energy exchange between light and sound was first suggested by Brillouin in\n1922. After Townes established the phonon maser theory, coherent generation of\nintense hypersonic waves was observed together with stimulated Brillouin\nScattering. Here we repeat these experiments, but with capillary-waves that are\nunique to the liquid phase of matter and relates to attraction between intimate\nfluid particles. We fabricate resonators that co-host capillary and\nopticalmodes, control it to operates at its non resolved sideband, and observe\nstimulated capillary scattering and coherent excitation of capillary resonances\nat kHz rates (that one can hear in audio files recorded by us). By exchanging\nenergy between electromagnetic and capillary waves, we bridge interfacial\ntension phenomena at the liquid phase boundary to optics, and might impact\noptofluidics by allowing optical control, interrogation and cooling of water\nwaves.\n", "  It is shown that, when there is a magnetic field present, in the framework of\nclassical or quantum mechanics, the active translations differ from the passive\nones and that the canonical momentum is not the generator of them. It is also\nshown that an infinitesimal generator of passive translations or rotations\nexists only if the magnetic field is invariant under these transformations.\n", "  Here we deal in a pedagogical way with an approach to construct an algebraic\nstructure for the Quantum Mechanical measurement processes from the concept of\n\\emph{Measurement Symbol}. Such concept was conceived by Julian S. Schwinger\nand constitutes a fundamental piece in his variational formalism and its\nseveral applications.\n", "  Field reddenings are summarized for 68 Cepheids from published studies and\nupdated results presented here. The compilation forms the basis for a\ncomparison with other published reddening scales of Cepheids, including those\nestablished from reddening-independent indices, photometry on the Lick\nsix-color system, Str\\\"{o}mgren system, Walraven system, Washington system,\nCape $BVI$ system, DDO system, and Geneva system, IRSB studies, and Cepheid\nspectroscopy, both old and new. Reddenings tied to period-color relations are\nthe least reliable, as expected, while photometric color excesses vary in\nprecision, their accuracy depending on the methodology and calibration sample.\nThe tests provide insights into the accuracy and precision of published Cepheid\nreddening scales, and lead to a new system of standardized reddenings\ncomprising a sample of 198 variables with an average uncertainty of $\\pm0.028$\nin E$_{B-V}$, the precision being less than $\\pm0.01$ for many. The collected\ncolor excesses are used to map the dispersion in intrinsic colors as a function\nof pulsation period, the results contradicting current perceptions about the\nperiod dependence of dispersion in Cepheid effective temperatures.\n", "  Since the 1970s it has been known that noble gases scintillate in the near\ninfrared (NIR) region of the spectrum (0.7 $\\mu$m < $\\lambda$; < 1.5$\\mu$m).\nMore controversial has been the question of the NIR light yield for condensed\nnoble gases. We first present the motivation for using the NIR scintillation in\nliquid argon detectors, then briefly review early as well as more recent\nefforts and finally show encouraging preliminary results of a test performed at\nFermilab.\n", "  Three reasonable hypotheses lead to the thesis that physical phenomena can be\ndescribed and simulated with cellular automata. In this work, we attempt to\ndescribe the motion of a particle upon which a constant force is applied, with\na cellular automaton, in Newtonian physics, in Special Relativity, and in\nGeneral Relativity. The results are very different for these three theories.\n", "  Bulk hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a highly nonlinear natural hyperbolic\nmaterial that attracts major attention in modern nanophotonics applications.\nHowever, studies of its optical properties in the visible part of the spectrum\nand quantum emitters hosted by bulk hBN have not been reported to date. In this\nwork we study the emission properties of hBN crystals in the red spectral range\nusing sub-bandgap optical excitation. Quantum emission from defects is observed\nat room temperature and characterized in detail. Our results advance the use of\nhBN in quantum nanophotonics technologies and enhance our fundamental\nunderstanding of its optical properties.\n", "  This study explores student attitudes to the use of substantive on-line\nassessments that require mathematical answers. Our goal is to learn what are\nthe important aspects in a design of more effective e-assessments that support\nlearning of mathematical subjects in a higher education setting. To that end we\nanalyse the effects of a variety of attitudinal factors towards such\nassessments amongst a cross-section of 1st year students in an English\nUniversity. These students were all previously exposed to on-line assessments\ncontaining substantial mathematical work, including testing of and feedback on\nthe algebraic structure of their answers. They were provided with detailed\nonline feedback, and we therefore specifically examine the effect of formative\nfeedback on the usage of educational technology. Our results suggest that\nstudents find on-line feedback more enjoyable and useful than traditional\nfeedback. 'Attitude' and 'Enjoyment' are the two most important factors\ninfluencing their usage intention. Our results also show that, even for this\ndigital generation, confidence in using computers and the availability of\nsupport for using information technology are important factors in making\neffective use of on-line assessments.\n", "  This work is devoted to analyze the relation between the thermodynamic\nproperties of a confined fluid and the shape of its confining vessel. Recently,\nnew insights in this topic were found through the study of cluster integrals\nfor inhomogeneous fluids, that revealed the dependence on the vessel shape of\nthe low density behavior of the system. Here, the statistical mechanics and\nthermodynamics of fluids confined in wedges or by edges is revisited, focusing\non their cluster integrals. In particular, the well known hard sphere fluid,\nwhich was not studied in this framework so far, is analyzed under confinement\nand its thermodynamic properties are analytically studied up to order two in\nthe density. Furthermore, the analysis is extended to the confinement produced\nby a corrugated wall. These results rely on the obtained analytic expression\nfor the second cluster integral of the confined hard sphere system as a\nfunction of the opening dihedral angle $0<\\beta<2\\pi$. It enables a unified\napproach to both wedges and edges.\n", "  Ultrasonic standing waves in a cylindrical enclosure can achieve very high\nlocal pressures at the acoustic nodes (~1 MPa). When the acoustic wave passes\nthrough a phononic crystal comprised of steel and glycerin, there are regions\nof constructive interference resulting in even higher local pressures (~100\nMPa). At these highly localized pressure points inside the crystal, the\nequations describing the acoustics break down and the mathematics of\ngravitational fields are more appropriate. These pressures are so high as to\ncreate optical space singularities, analogous to cosmological phenomena. We\nmeasure a redshift for light passing through this system and describe how the\noptical space thus created can be described by elementary equations of a\nnon-rotating black hole.\n", "  Particle-hole instabilities are studied within a two dimensional model of\nfermions interacting with antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations (spin-fermion\nmodel). In contrast to previous works, we assume that neighboring hot spots\noverlap due to a shallow dispersion of the electron spectrum in the antinodal\nregion and include in the consideration effects of a remnant low energy and\nmomentum Coulomb interaction. It turns out that this modification of the model\ndrastically changes the behavior of the system. The leading particle-hole\ninstability at not very weak fermion-fermion interaction is no longer a charge\ndensity wave with a modulation along the diagonals of the Brillouin zone\npredicted previously but a Pomeranchuk-type deformation of the Fermi surface\nbreaking the C$_{4}$ symmetry of the system. This order does not prevent from\nfurther phase transitions at lower temperatures. We show that, depending on\nparameters of the interaction, either d-wave superconductivity or charge\ndensity wave with modulations along the bonds of the $CuO$ lattice is possible.\nThe low momentum remnant Coulomb interaction enhances the d-form factor of the\ncharge density wave. Comparison with experimental data allows us to conclude\nthat in many cuprate compounds the conditions for the proposed scenario are\nindeed fulfilled. Our results may explain important features of the charge\nmodulations observed recently.\n", "  The shear viscosity tensor of the superfluid Fermi gas in p-wave state with\nweak interaction is calculated at low temperatures, by using the Boltzmann\nequation approach. We consider the transition probabilities for the binary,\ndecay and coalescence processes. We show that only the binary processes are\ndominated at low temperatures and the components of shear viscosity {\\eta}_xy,\n{\\eta}_xx, {\\eta}_yy are proportional to (1/T)^2, and {\\eta}_xz, {\\eta}_yz and\n{\\eta}_zz are proportional to (1/T)^4 and (1/T)^6, respectively.\n", "  We compare the temperature dependence of optical and electrical\ncharacteristics of commercially available GaN light-emitting diodes (LEDs)\ngrown on silicon and sapphire substrates. Contrary to conventional\nexpectations, LEDs grown on silicon substrates, commonly referred to as\nGaN-on-Si LEDs, show less efficiency droop at higher temperatures even with\nmore threading dislocations. Analysis of the junction temperature reveals that\nGaN-on-Si LEDs have a cooler junction despite sharing identical epitaxial\nstructures and packaging compared to LEDs grown on sapphire substrates. We also\nobserve a decrease in ideality factor with increase in ambient temperature for\nGaN-on-Si LEDs, indicating an increase in ideal diode current with temperature.\nAnalysis of the strain and temperature coefficient measurements suggests that\nthere is an increase in hole transport efficiency within the active region for\nGaN-on-Si LEDs compared to the LEDs grown on sapphire, which accounts for the\nless temperature-dependent efficiency droop.\n", "  A deep-space exploration mission with low-thrust propulsion to rendezvous\nwith multiple asteroids is investigated. Indirect methods, based on the optimal\ncontrol theory, are implemented to optimize the fuel consumption. The\napplication of indirect methods for optimizing low-thrust trajectories between\ntwo asteroids is briefly given. An effective method is proposed to provide\ninitial guesses for transfers between close near-circular near-coplanar orbits.\nThe conditions for optimality of a multi-asteroid rendezvous mission are\ndetermined. The intuitive method of splitting the trajectories into several\nlegs that are solved sequentially is applied first. Then the results are\npatched together by a scaling method to provide a tentative guess for\noptimizing the whole trajectory. Numerical examples of optimizing three probe\nexploration sequences that contain a dozen asteroids each demonstrate the\nvalidity and efficiency of these methods.\n", "  We report a study of the superconducting and normal-state properties of the\nfilled-skutterudite system PrPt$_{4}$Ge$_{12-x}$Sb$_x$. Polycrystalline samples\nwith Sb concentrations up to $x =$ 5 were synthesized and investigated by means\nof x-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and\nspecific heat measurements. We observed a suppression of superconductivity with\nincreasing Sb substitution up to $x =$ 4, above which, no signature of\nsuperconductivity was observed down to 140 mK. The Sommerfeld coefficient,\n$\\gamma$, of superconducting specimens decreases with increasing $x$ up to $x\n=$ 3, suggesting that superconductivity may depend on the density of electronic\nstates in this system. The specific heat for $x =$ 0.5 exhibits an exponential\ntemperature dependence in the superconducting state, reminiscent of a nodeless\nsuperconducting energy gap. We observed evidence for a weak \"rattling\" mode\nassociated with the Pr ions, characterized by an Einstein temperature\n$\\Theta_{\\mathrm{E}} \\sim$ 60 K for 0 $\\leq x \\leq$ 5; however, the rattling\nmode may not play any role in suppressing superconductivity.\n", "  Single-photon avalanche photodiode(SPAD) has been widely used in researching\nof quantum optics. Afterpulsing effect, which is an intrinsic character of\nSPAD, affects the system performance in most of the experiments and needs to be\ncarefully handled. For a long time, afterpulsing has been presumed to be\ndetermined by the pre-ignition avalanche. We studied the afterpulsing effect of\na commercial InGaAs/InP SPAD (APD: Princeton Lightwave PGA-300) and\ndemonstrated that its afterpulsing is non-Markov, which has memory effect of\nthe avalanching history. Theoretical analysis and the experimental results\nclearly indicate that the embodiment of this memory effect is the afterpulsing\nprobability, which increases as the number of ignition-avalanche pulses\nincrease. The conclusion makes the principle of afterpulsing effect clearer and\nis instructive to the manufacturing processes and afterpulsing evaluation of\nhigh-count-rate SPADs. It can also be regarded as an fundamental premise to\nhandle the afterpulsing signals in many applications, such as quantum\ncommunication and quantum random number generator.\n", "  The cosmic distance can be precisely determined using a `standard ruler'\nimprinted by primordial baryon acoustic oscillation (hereafter BAO) in the\nearly Universe. The BAO at the targeted epoch is observed by analysing galaxy\nclustering in redshift space (hereafter RSD) for which a theoretical\nformulation is not yet fully understood, and thus makes this methodology\nunsatisfactory. The BAO analysis following a full RSD modelling is contaminated\nby systematic uncertainties due to a non-linear smearing effects such as\nnon-linear corrections and by random viral velocity of galaxies. However, the\nBAO can be probed independently of RSD contamination using the BAO peak\npositions located in the 2D anisotropic correlation function. A new methodology\nis presented to measure peak positions, to test whether it is also contaminated\nby the same systematics in RSD, and to provide the radial and transverse cosmic\ndistances determined by the 2D BAO peak positions. We find that in our model\nindependent anisotropic clustering analysis we can obtain about $2\\%$ and $5\\%$\nconstraints on $D_A$ and $H^{-1}$ respectively with current BOSS data, which is\ncompetitive with other analysis.\n", "  We prove a fixed frequency inverse scattering result for the magnetic\nSchr\\\"odinger operator (or connection Laplacian) on surfaces with Euclidean\nends. We show that, under suitable decaying conditions, the scattering matrix\nfor the operator determines both the gauge class of the connection and the\nzeroth order potential.\n", "  Finding communities or clusters in social networks is a fa- mous topic in\nsocial network analysis. Most algorithms are limited to static snapshots, so\nthey cannot handle dynamics within the underlying graph. In this paper we\npresent a modification of the Louvain community detec- tion method to handle\nchanges in the graph without rerunning the full algorithm. Also, we adapted the\nLouvain greedy approach to optimize the Infomap measure. The main idea is, to\nrecalculate only a small area around the changes. Depending on the graph size\nand the amount of changes, this yields a massive runtime decrease. As\nvalidation data, we provide a graph generator, which produces spe- cific\ncommunity structures, at given times and also intermediate steps to transform\nthe graph from one to another specific graph. Experiments show that runtime\ndecrease is possible without much loss of quality. These values depend on the\nreprocessed area inside the graph.\n", "  The modern definition of optical coherence highlights a frequency dependent\nfunction based on a matrix of spectra and cross-spectra. Due to general\nproperties of matrices, such a function is invariant in changes of basis. In\nthis article, we attempt to measure the proximity of two stationary fields by a\nreal and positive number between 0 and 1. The extremal values will correspond\nto uncorrelation and linear dependence, similar to a correlation coefficient\nwhich measures linear links between random variables. We show that these\n\"indices of coherence\" are generally not symmetric, and not unique. We study\nand we illustrate this problem together for one-dimensional and two-dimensional\nfields in the framework of stationary processes.\n", "  The physicochemical behavior of elements and compounds is heavily altered by\nhigh pressure. The occurrence of pressure-induced reactions and phase\ntransitions can be revealed by crystal structure prediction approaches. In this\nwork, we explore the C-H-O phase diagram up to 400 GPa exploiting an\nevolutionary algorithm for crystal structure predictions along with ab initio\ncalculations. Besides uncovering new stable polymorphs of high-pressure\nelements and known molecules, we predicted the formation of new compounds. A\n2CH4:3H2 inclusion compound forms at low pressure and remains stable up to 215\nGPa. Carbonic acid (H2CO3), highly unstable at ambient conditions, was\npredicted to form exothermically at mild pressure (about 1 GPa). As pressure\nrises, it polymerizes and, above 300 GPa, reacts with water to form\northocarbonic acid (H4CO4). This unexpected high-pressure chemistry is\nrationalized by analyzing charge density and electron localization function\ndistributions, and implications for general chemistry and planetary science are\nalso discussed.\n", "  Nonnegative Boltzmann machines (NNBMs) are recurrent probabilistic neural\nnetwork models that can describe multi-modal nonnegative data. NNBMs form\nrectified Gaussian distributions that appear in biological neural network\nmodels, positive matrix factorization, nonnegative matrix factorization, and so\non. In this paper, an effective inference method for NNBMs is proposed that\nuses the mean-field method, referred to as the Thouless--Anderson--Palmer\nequation, and the diagonal consistency method, which was recently proposed.\n", "  Adsorption of fibrinogen on positively charged microspheres was theoretically\nand experimentally studied. The structure of monolayers and the maximum\ncoverage were determined by applying the experimental measurements at pH=3.5\nand 9.7 for NaCl concentration in the range of $10^{-3}- 0.15$ M. The maximum\ncoverage of fibrinogen on latex particles was precisely determined by the AFM\nmethod. Unexpectedly, at pH=3.5, where both fibrinogen molecule and the latex\nparticles were positively charged, the maximum coverage varied between 0.9 mg\nm$^{-2}$ and 1.1 mg m$^{-2}$ for $10^{-2}$ and 0.15 M NaCl, respectively. On\nthe other hand, at pH=9.7, the maximum coverage of fibrinogen was larger,\nvarying between 1.8 mg m$^{-2}$ and 3.4 mg m$^{-2}$ for $10^{-2}$ and 0.15 M\nNaCl, respectively. The experimental results were quantitatively interpreted by\nthe numerical simulations.\n", "  We study a rectifying mutant of the OmpF porin ion channel using both\nall-atom and reduced models. The mutant was created by Miedema et al. [Nano\nLett., 2007, 7, 2886] on the basis of the N-P semiconductor diode, in which an\nN-P junction is formed. The mutant contains a pore region with positive amino\nacids on the left-hand side and negative amino acids on the right-hand side.\nExperiments show that this mutant rectifies. Although we do not know the\nstructure of this mutant, we can build an all-atom model for it on the basis of\nthe structure of the wild type channel. Interestingly, molecular dynamics\nsimulations for this all-atom model do not produce rectification. A reduced\nmodel that contains only the important degrees of freedom (the positive and\nnegative amino acids and free ions in an implicit solvent), on the other hand,\nexhibits rectification. Our calculations for the reduced model (using the\nNernst-Planck equation coupled to Local Equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations)\nreveal a rectification mechanism that is different from that seen for\nsemiconductor diodes. The basic reason is that the ions are different in nature\nfrom electrons and holes (they do not recombine). We provide explanations for\nthe failure of the all-atom model including the effect of all the other atoms\nin the system as a noise that inhibits the response of ions (that would be\nnecessary for rectification) to the polarizing external field.\n", "  The concept of the surface of a protein in solution, as well of the interface\nbetween protein and 'bulk solution', is introduced. The experimental technique\nof small angle X-ray and neutron scattering is introduced and described\nbriefly. Molecular dynamics simulation, as an appropriate computational tool\nfor studying the hydration shell of proteins, is also discussed. The concept of\nprotein surfaces with fractal dimensions is elaborated. We finish by exposing\nan experimental (using small angle X-ray scattering) and a computer simulation\ncase study, which are meant as demonstrations of the possibilities we have at\nhand for investigating the delicate interfaces that connect (and divide)\nprotein molecules and the neighboring electrolyte solution.\n", "  In this thesis, we study the Hamiltonian and covariant phase space\ndescription of gravitational theories. The phase space represents the allowed\nfield configurations and is accompanied by a closed nondegenerate 2 form- the\nsymplectic form. We will show that local/gauge symmetries of the action fall\ninto two different categories in the phase space formulation. Those\ncorresponding to constraints in the phase space, and those associated with\nnontrivial conserved charges. We argue that while the former is related to\nredundant gauge degrees of freedom, the latter leads to physically distinct\nstates of the system, known as surface degrees of freedom and can induce a\nlower dimensional dynamics on the system. These ideas are then implemented to\nbuild the phase space of specific gravitational systems: 1) asymptotically AdS3\nspacetimes, and 2) near horizon geometries of extremal black holes (NHEG) in\narbitrary dimension. In the AdS3 phase space, we show that Brown-Henneaux\nasymptotic symmetries can be extended inside the bulk of spacetime and hence\nbecome symplectic symmetries of the phase space. We will show that in the NHEG\nphase space, surface gravitons form a Virasoro algebra in four dimensions, and\na novel generalization of Virasoro in higher dimensions. The central charge of\nthe algebra is proportional to the entropy of the corresponding extremal black\nhole. We study the holographic description of NHEG phase space and show that\nthe charges can be computed through a Liouville type stress tensor defined over\na lower dimensional torus. We will discuss whether surface gravitons can serve\nas the microscopic origin of black hole entropy.\n", "  Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation results are reported for an electric\ndouble layer modelled by a planar charged hard wall, anisotropic shape cations,\nand spherical anions at different electrolyte concentrations and asymmetric\nvalencies. The cations consist of two tangentially tethered hard spheres of the\nsame diameter, $d$. One sphere is charged while the other is neutral. Spherical\nanions are charged hard spheres of diameter $d$. The ion valency asymmetry 1:2\nand 2:1 is considered, with the ions being immersed in a solvent mimicked by a\ncontinuum dielectric medium at standard temperature. The simulations are\ncarried out for the following electrolyte concentrations: 0.1, 1.0 and 2.0 M.\nProfiles of the electrode-ion, electrode-neutral sphere singlet distributions,\nthe average orientation of dimers, and the mean electrostatic potential are\ncalculated for a given electrode surface charge, $\\sigma$, while the contact\nelectrode potential and the differential capacitance are presented for varying\nelectrode charge. With an increasing electrolyte concentration, the shape of\ndifferential capacitance curve changes from that with a minimum surrounded by\nmaxima into that of a distorted single maximum. For a 2:1 electrolyte, the\nmaximum is located at a small negative $\\sigma$ value while for 1:2, at a small\npositive value.\n", "  We present recent developments in the application of exact amplitude-based\nresummation methods in the confrontation between precision theory and recent\nexperimental results. As a consequence, we argue that these methods open the\nway to 1\\% total theoretical precision in LHC and FCC physics when realized via\nMC event generators.\n", "  Massive stars unable to sustain gravitational collapse, at the end of nuclear\nburning stage, turns out into core-collapse supernovae, leaving behind compact\nobjects like neutron stars or black holes. The progenitor properties like mass\nand metallicity primarily governs the explosion parameters and type of compact\nremnant. In this contribution we summarize observational study of three Core\nCollapse type IIP SNe 2012aw, 2013ab and 2013ej, which are rigorously observed\nfrom ARIES and other Indian observatories and discuss their progenitor and\nexplosion properties.\n", "  We provide a detailed quantitative study of the possible role of a small\nadmixture of harmonics on resonant two-photon ionization. The motivation comes\nfrom the occasional presence of 2nd and 3rd harmonics in FEL radiation. We\nobtain the dependence of ionic yields on the intensity of the fundamental, the\npercentage of 2nd harmonic and the detuning of the fundamental from resonance.\nHaving examined the cases of one and two intermediate resonances, we arrive at\nresults of general validity and global behavior, showing that even a small\namount of harmonic may seem deceptively innocuous.\n", "  We consider a general class of three--state models where individuals hold one\nof two opposite opinions, or are neutral, and exchange opinions in generic\npairwise interactions. We show that when opinions spread in a population where\na fraction of individuals (zealots) maintain unshakably their opinion, one of\nfour qualitatively distinct kinds of collective dynamics arise, depending on\nthe specific rules governing the social interactions. Unsurprisingly, when\ntheir density is high, zealots drive the whole population to consensus on their\nopinion. For low densities a rich phase diagram emerges: a finite population of\ndissenters can survive and be the only stationary state or may need a critical\nmass or dissenters to be sustained; the critical mass may vanish or not as the\ndensity is reduced; the transition to the high density regime can be smooth or\nabrupt, and shows interesting hysteretic effects. For each choice of the\ninteraction rules we calculate the critical density of zealots above which\ndiverse opinions cannot survive.\n", "  The goal of nuclear structure theory is to build a comprehensive microscopic\nframework in which properties of nuclei and extended nuclear matter, and\nnuclear reactions and decays can all be consistently described. Due to novel\ntheoretical concepts, breakthroughs in the experimentation with rare isotopes,\nincreased exchange of ideas across different research areas, and the progress\nin computer technologies and numerical algorithms, nuclear theorists have been\nquite successful in solving various bits and pieces of the nuclear many-body\npuzzle and the prospects are exciting. This article contains a brief, personal\nperspective on the status of the field.\n", "  Optical (BVRI) photometry of the first three weeks of the 2016 outburst of\nthe recurrent Nova LMC 1968 is presented and discussed. The 2016 I-band\nlight-curve is an exact replica, even in the most minute details, of that for\nthe 2010 eruption. The maximum is inferred to have occurred on 2016 Jan 21.2 at\nI=11.5 mag, corresponding to an absolute magnitude M(I)=-7.15. A ~1 day plateau\nis present in all bands about six days past optical maximum, simultaneous with\nthe emergence of super-soft X-ray emission in Swift observations, signalling\nthe widespread ionization of the ejecta. The nova entered a much longer plateau\nabout 9 days past maximum, governed by the brightness of the white dwarf, now\ndirectly visible and still nuclearly burning on its surface. An outburst\nrecurrence mean period of ~955 days (2.6 yrs) would fit both the OGLE\ninter-season gaps and the observed intervals between previous outburts.\n", "  We have developed a new type of particle identification device, called an\nAerogel Ring Imaging Cherenkov (ARICH) counter, for the Belle II experiment. It\nuses silica aerogel tiles as Cherenkov radiators. For detection of Cherenkov\nphotons, Hybrid Avalanche Photo-Detectors (HAPDs) are used. The designed HAPD\nhas a high sensitivity to single photons under a strong magnetic field. We have\nconfirmed that the HAPD provides high efficiency for single-photon detection\neven after exposure to neutron and gamma-ray radiation that exceeds the levels\nexpected in the 10-year Belle II operation. In order to confirm the basic\nperformance of the ARICH counter system, we carried out a beam test at the DESY\nusing a prototype of the ARICH counter with six HAPD modules. The results are\nin agreement with our expectations and confirm the suitability of the ARICH\ncounter for the Belle II experiment. Based on the in-beam performance of the\ndevice, we expect that the identification efficiency at 3.5 GeV/c is 97.4% and\n4.9% for pions and kaons, respectively. This paper summarizes the development\nof the HAPD for the ARICH and the evaluation of the performance of the\nprototype ARICH counter built with the final design components.\n", "  It is interesting to ask what fraction of the total available RR Lyrae (RRL)\nsample that falls in the $Kepler$ and $K2$ Fields of View (FoV) is known or\ndiscovered. In order assess the completeness of our sample we compared the\nknown RRL sample in the $Kepler$ and $K2$ fields with synthetic Galactic\nmodels. The Catalina Sky Survey RRL sample was used to calibrate our method. We\nfound that a large number of faint RRL stars is missing from $Kepler$ and $K2$\nfields.\n", "  We investigate the initial state geometric quantities of heavy ion collisions\nbased on the quark participant assumption in the Glauber multiple scattering\napproach. A systematic comparison to the nucleon participant assumption has\nbeen presented and confronted with the charged multiplicity measurements in\nvarious collision systems. It is found that the quark participant based\nassumption can be important to understand the data in multiplicity production\nand the initial spatial eccentricity in small systems.\n", "  We study the impact of the ferroelectric domain wall on the ballistic\nconductance of the single-layer graphene channel in the heterostructure\ngraphene / physical gap / ferroelectric film using Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin\napproximation. Both self-consistent numerical modeling of the electric field\nand space charge dynamics in the heterostructure and approximate analytical\ntheory show that the domain wall contact with the surface creates p-n junction\nin graphene channel. We calculated that the carriers' concentration induced in\ngraphene by uncompensated ferroelectric dipoles originated from the spontaneous\npolarization abrupt near the surface can reach the values of 1019 m-2 order,\nwhich is in two orders higher than it can be obtained for the gate doped\ngraphene on non-ferroelectric substrates. Therefore we predict that graphene\nchannel with the p-n junction caused by ferroelectric domain wall would be\ncharacterized by rather high ballistic conductivity.\n", "  The threshold current density of narrow (1.5 {\\mu}m) ridge-waveguide InGaN\nmulti-quantum-well laser diodes, as well as the shape of their lateral\nfar-field patterns, strongly depend on the etch depth of the ridge waveguide.\nBoth effects can be attributed to strong index-antiguiding. A value of the\nantiguiding factor R = 10 is experimentally determined near threshold by\nmeasurements of the current-dependent gain and refractive index spectra. The\ndevice performances are simulated self-consistently solving the\nSchr\\\"odinger-Poisson equations and the equations for charge transport and\nwaveguiding. Assuming a carrier-induced index change which matches the\nexperimentally determined antiguiding factor, both the measured high threshold\ncurrent and the shape of the far-field pattern of lasers with shallow ridges\ncan be reproduced theoretically.\n", "  The equation of motion method (EOM) for Green functions is one of the tools\nused in the analysis of quantum dot system coupled with metallic and\nsuperconducting leads. We investigate modified EOM, based on differentiation of\ndouble-time temperature dependent Green functions both after primary time t and\nsecondary time t'. Our EOM approach allows us to obtain the Abrikosov-Suhl\nresonance both in the particle-hole symmetric case but also in the asymmetric\ncases. We will apply the irreducible Green functions technique to analyses the\nEOM for dot system. This method give a workable decoupling scheme breaking the\ninfinite set of Green function equations. We apply this technique for\ncalculating the density of the states and the differential conductance of\nsingle-level quantum dot with Coulomb repulsion attached to one metallic and\none superconducting leads (N-QD-SC). Our results are compared with the\nexperimental data and previous calculations.\n", "  Positron Two Dimensional Angular Correlation of Annihilation Radiation\n(2D-ACAR) measurements reveal modifications of the electronic structure and\ncomposition at the surfaces of PbSe quantum dots (QDs), deposited as thin\nfilms, produced by various ligands containing either oxygen or nitrogen atoms.\nIn particular, the 2D-ACAR measurements on thin films of colloidal PbSe QDs\ncapped with oleic acid ligands yield an increased intensity in the electron\nmomentum density (EMD) at high momenta compared to PbSe quantum dots capped\nwith oleylamine. Moreover, the EMD of PbSe QDs is strongly affected by the\nsmall ethylediamine ligands, since these molecules lead to small distances\nbetween QDs and favor neck formation between near neighbor QDs, inducing\nelectronic coupling between neighboring QDs. The high sensitivity to the\npresence of oxygen atoms at the surface can be also exploited to monitor the\nsurface oxidation of PbSe QDs upon exposure to air. Our study clearly\ndemonstrates that positron annihilation spectroscopy applied to thin films can\nprobe surface transformations of colloidal semiconductor QDs embedded in\nfunctional layers.\n", "  Controlling anisotropy in nanostructures is a challenging but rewarding task\nsince confinement in one or more dimensions influences the physical and\nchemical properties of the items decisively. In particular, semiconducting\nnanostructures can be tailored to gain optimized properties to work as\ntransistors or absorber material in solar cells. We demonstrate that the shape\nof colloidal lead sulfide nanostructures can be tuned from spheres to stripes\nto sheets by means of the precursor concentrations, the concentration of a\nchloroalkane co-ligand and the synthesis temperature. All final structures\nstill possess at least one dimension in confinement. Electrical transport\nmeasurements complement the findings.\n", "  We present a new simple relativistic model for planetary motion describing\naccurately the anomalous precession of the perihelion of Mercury and its\norigin. The model is based on transforming Newton's classical equation for\nplanetary motion from absolute to real spacetime influenced by the\ngravitational potential and introducing the concept of influenced direction.\n", "  A multiscale numerical model based on nonequilibrium thermal effect for\nmelting of metal powder bed subjected to constant heat flux is developed. The\nvolume shrinkage due to density change is taken into account. The\nnonequilibrium model is discretized by an implicit finite difference method and\nsolved numerically using an iterative tri-diagonal matrix algorithm. The\nevolutions of powder bed surface temperature and various interfacial locations\nas well as the melting temperature range during the melting process are\ninvestigated. The results show that liquid region, upper and lower parts of\nmushy zone are formed on the top of unsintered zone as the melting progresses.\nThe duration of the preheating stage shortens and the melting rate accelerates\nas the initial porosity or initial temperature increases while particle size\nhas much less effect on the melting process. The parametric study shows the\nmelting temperature range of the powder bed widens with increasing initial\nporosity, decreasing initial temperature or increasing particle size.\n", "  After the very long consideration of the ideal energy source by fusion of the\nprotons of light hydrogen with the boron isotope 11 (boron fusion HB11) the\nvery first two independent measurements of very high reaction gains by lasers\nbasically opens a fundamental breakthrough. The non-thermal plasma block\nignition with extremely high power laser pulses above petawatt of picosecond\nduration in combination with up to ten kilotesla magnetic fields for trapping\nhas to be combined to use the measured high gains as proof of an avalanche\nreaction for an environmentally clean, low cost and lasting energy source as\npotential option against global warming. The unique HB11 avalanche reaction is\nare now based on elastic collisions of helium nuclei (alpha particles) limited\nonly to a reactor for controlled fusion energy during a very short time within\na very small volume.\n", "  The understanding of hydrogen attachment to carbonaceous surfaces is\nessential to a wide variety of research fields and technologies such as\nhydrogen storage for transportation, precise localization of hydrogen in\nelectronic devices and the formation of cosmic H2. For coronene cations as\nprototypical Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules, the existence of\nmagic numbers upon hydrogenation was uncovered experimentally. Quantum\nchemistry calculations show that hydrogenation follows a site-specific sequence\nleading to the appearance of cations having 5, 11, or 17 hydrogen atoms\nattached, exactly the magic numbers found in the experiments. For these\nclosed-shell cations, further hydrogenation requires appreciable structural\nchanges associated with a high transition barrier. Controlling specific\nhydrogenation pathways would provide the possibility to tune the location of\nhydrogen attachment and the stability of the system. The sequence to\nhydrogenate PAHs, leading to PAHs with magic numbers of H atoms attached,\nprovides clues to understand that carbon in space is mostly aromatic and\npartially aliphatic in PAHs. PAH hydrogenation is fundamental to assess the\ncontribution of PAHs to the formation of cosmic H2.\n", "  A qualitative study of the electron-phonon interaction (EPI) spectra in\n$2H-NbS{{e}_{2}}$ is carried out by the method of point-contact spectroscopy in\nthe superconducting state. Anisotropy of the EPI spectra for contacts oriented\nin the principal crystallographic directions (along the $c$ axis and parallel\nto the basal surface) was observed. Approximate values of the positions of the\nmain features in the phonon density of states were established for both\ndirections. The additional low-frequency peaks observed in the spectra for\nseparate crystallographic orientations are associated with the collective\noscillations of the amplitude and phase of charge density waves.\n", "  We present new time-series photometry of the accreting pulsating white dwarf\nsystem GW Librae obtained in 2012 and 2013 at the University of Canterbury Mt\nJohn Observatory in New Zealand. Our 2012 data show the return of a $\\sim$19\nminute periodicity that was previously detected in 2008. This pulsation mode\nwas a dominant feature of our quality May 2012 data set, which consisted of six\ncontiguous nights; a detailed analysis indicated a degree of frequency\nvariability. We show by comparison with the previously identified pulsation\nmodes that this periodicity is best explained as a new mode, and that the\nquasi-stability of the periods appears to be a general feature of the\npulsations in these systems. We also find a previously unreported 3-hour\nmodulation period, which we believe to be related to the known two and four\nhour periods of so far unknown origin.\n", "  Nucleation and growth is the dominant relaxation mechanism driving first\norder phase transitions. In two-dimensional at systems nucleation has been\napplied to a wide range of problems in physics, chemistry and biology. Here we\nstudy nucleation and growth of two-dimensional phases lying on curved surfaces\nand show that curvature modify both, critical sizes of nuclei and paths towards\nthe equilibrium phase. In curved space nucleation and growth becomes inherently\ninhomogeneous and critical nuclei form faster on regions of positive Gaussian\ncurvature. Substrates of varying shape display complex energy landscapes with\nseveral geometry-induced local minima, where initially propagating nuclei\nbecome stabilized and trapped by the underlying curvature.\n", "  The thermonuclear $^{30}$P($p,\\gamma$)$^{31}$S reaction rate is critical for\nmodeling the final elemental and isotopic abundances of ONe nova\nnucleosynthesis, which affect the calibration of proposed nova thermometers and\nthe identification of presolar nova grains, respectively. Unfortunately, the\nrate of this reaction is essentially unconstrained experimentally, because the\nstrengths of key $^{31}$S proton capture resonance states are not known,\nlargely due to uncertainties in their spins and parities. Using the $\\beta$\ndecay of $^{31}$Cl, we have observed the $\\beta$-delayed $\\gamma$ decay of a\n$^{31}$S state at $E_x = 6390.2(7)$ keV, with a $^{30}$P($p,\\gamma$)$^{31}$S\nresonance energy of $E_r = 259.3(8)$ keV, in the middle of the\n$^{30}$P($p,\\gamma$)$^{31}$S Gamow window for peak nova temperatures. This\nstate exhibits isospin mixing with the nearby isobaric analog state (IAS) at\n$E_x = 6279.0(6)$ keV, giving it an unambiguous spin and parity of $3/2^+$ and\nmaking it an important $l = 0$ resonance for proton capture on $^{30}$P.\n", "  We present early results from Radio Galaxy Zoo, a web-based citizen science\nproject for visual inspection and classification of images from all-sky radio\nsurveys. The goals of the project are to classify individual radio sources\n(particularly galaxies with multiple lobes and/or complex morphologies) as well\nas matching the continuum radio emission to the host galaxy. Radio images come\nfrom the FIRST and ATLAS surveys, while matches to potential hosts are\nperformed with infrared imaging from WISE and SWIRE. The first twelve months of\nclassification yielded more than 1 million classifications of more than 60,000\nsources. For images with at least 75% consensus by the volunteer classifiers,\nthe accuracy is comparable to visual inspection by the expert science team.\nBased on mid-infrared colors, the hosts associated with radio emission are\nprimarily a mixture of elliptical galaxies, QSOs, and LIRGs, which are in good\nagreement with previous studies. The full catalog of radio lobes and their host\ngalaxies will measure the relative populations of host types as a function of\nradio morphology and power. Radio Galaxy Zoo has also been an effective method\nfor detecting extremely rare objects, such as HyMORs and giant radio galaxies.\nResults from the project are being used to train automatic algorithms for host\nmatching for use in future large continuum surveys such as EMU, as well as\nestablishing roles for citizen science in projects such as the SKA.\n", "  The continuum mechanics of line defects representing singularities due to\nterminating discontinuities of the elastic displacement and its gradient field\nis developed. The development is intended for application to coupled phase\ntransformation, grain boundary, and plasticity-related phenomena at the level\nof individual line defects and domain walls. The continuously distributed\ndefect approach is developed as a generalization of the discrete, isolated\ndefect case. Constitutive guidance for equilibrium response and dissipative\ndriving forces respecting frame-indifference and non-negative mechanical\ndissipation is derived. A differential geometric interpretation of the defect\nkinematics is developed, and the relative simplicity of the actual adopted\nkinematics is pointed out. The kinematic structure of the theory strongly\npoints to the incompatibility of dissipation with strict deformation\ncompatibility.\n", "  Superconductor-ferromagnet (S-F) hybrids based on half-metallic ferromagnets,\nsuch as CrO2, are excellent candidates for superconducting spintronic\napplications. This is primarily due to their fully spin polarized nature, which\nproduces significantly enhanced long-range triplet proximity effects.. However,\nreliable production of CrO2-based Josephson junctions (JJs) is challenging,\nmainly because of the difficulty to control the transparency of the S/F\ninterface. We have grown CrO2 nanowires by chemical vapor deposition on TiO2\nsubstrates combined with selective area growth in trenches defined with\namorphous SiOx. This allows us to create lateral JJs, with the nanowire as the\nweak link. We show that the nature of the growth is highly anisotropic, and\nthat the morphology of the CrO2 nanostructructures changes systematically\nduring the growth process, depending on the width of the trench. The detailed\ngrowth study enables us to synthesise multifaceted and highly homogeneous CrO2\nwires. These are utilized to fabricate JJs with high S/F interface\ntransparency, leading to large supercurrents. The well-defined geometry of the\ndevice allows us to reliably estimate an exceptionally high critical current\ndensity Jc = 10^9~Am^{-2} over a distance of 600~nm.\n", "  In this paper, we consider spin-3 Chern-Simons-like theories of gravity as\nextended theories of spin-3 gravity in (2+1)- dimension. In order to determine\nthe number of local degrees of freedom we present the Hamiltonian formulation\nof these theories. We extract the Hamiltonian density, then we find primary and\nsecondary constraints of these theories. Then we obtain the Poisson brackets of\nthe primary and the secondary constraints. After that we count the number of\nlocal degrees of freedom of spin-3 Chern-Simons-like theories of gravity. We\napply this method on spin-3 Einstein-Cartan gravity and spin-3 topologically\nmassive gravity. According to the our results the spin-3 Einstein-Cartan\ngravity and the spin-3 topologically massive gravity have respectively zero and\none bulk local degree of freedom.\n", "  We present an extensive review of gas phase reactions producing\nmethylacetylene and propene showing that these relatively abundant unsaturated\nhydrocarbons cannot be synthesized through gas-phase reactions. We explain the\nformation of propene and methylacetylene through surface hydrogenation of C3\ndepleted onto interstellar ices, C3 being a very abundant species in the gas\nphase.\n", "  Pleba\\'nski's class of nonlinear vacuum electrodynamics is considered which\nis for several reasons of interest at the present time. In particular the\nquestion is answered under which circumstances Maxwell's original field\nequations are recovered approximately and which post-Maxwellian effects could\narrise. To this end a weak field approximation method is developed allowing to\ncalculate post-Maxwellian corrections up to Nth order. In some respect this is\nanalogue of determining \"post-newtonian\" corrections from relativistic\nmechanics by a low velocity approximation. As a result we got a series of\nlinear field equations which can be solved order by order. In this context the\nsolutions of the lower orders occur as source terms inside the higher order\nfield equations and represent a \"post-Maxwellian\" self-interaction of the\nelectromagnetic field which increases order by order. One has to decide between\nproblems with and without external source-terms, because without also high\nfrequency solutions can be approximately described by Maxwell's original\nequations. The higher order approximations which describe \"post-Maxwellian\"\neffects can give rise for experimental tests of Pleba\\'nksi's class. Finally\ntwo boundary value problems are discussed to have examples at hand.\n", "  Common models for two-phase lipid bilayer membranes are based on an energy\nthat consists of an elastic term for each lipid phase and a line energy at\ninterfaces. Although such an energy controls only the length of interfaces, the\nmembrane surface is usually assumed to be at least $C^1$ across phase\nboundaries. We consider the spontaneous curvature model for closed rotationally\nsymmetric two-phase membranes without excluding tangent discontinuities at\ninterfaces a priorily. We introduce a family of energies for smooth surfaces\nand phase fields for the lipid phases and derive a sharp interface limit that\ncoincides with the $\\Gamma$-limit on all reasonable membranes and extends the\nclassical model by assigning a bending energy also to tangent discontinuities.\nThe theoretical result is illustrated by numerical examples.\n", "  We address the fundamental interplay between indistinguishability and\ninteractions when discreteness effects are neglected in systems with strictly\nfixed number of particles. For this end we supplement cluster expansions\n(many-body canonical techniques where quantum statistics is treated exactly)\nwith short-time/large volume dynamical information where interparticle forces\nare described non-perturbatively. This approach, specially suitable for the\nfew-body case where it overcomes the inappropriate use of virial expansions,\ncan be consistently combined with scaling considerations, minimal ground-state\ninformation and strong coupling expansions in such a way that a single\ninteraction event provides most of the thermodynamic and spectral properties of\n1D systems with short range interactions. Our analytical results, in excellent\nagreement with numerical simulations, show a form of universal integrability of\ninteraction effects for arbitrary confinements.\n", "  A marked lattice is a $d$-dimensional Euclidean lattice, where each lattice\npoint is assigned a mark via a given random field on ${\\mathbb Z}^d$. We prove\nthat, if the field is strongly mixing with a faster-than-logarithmic rate, then\nfor every given lattice and almost every marking, large spheres become\nequidistributed in the space of marked lattices. A key aspect of our study is\nthat the space of marked lattices is not a homogeneous space, but rather a\nnon-trivial fiber bundle over such a space. As an application, we prove that\nthe free path length in a crystal with random defects has a limiting\ndistribution in the Boltzmann-Grad limit.\n", "  We numerically investigate the dynamic heterogeneity and its length scale\nfound in the coarse-grained ionic liquid model systems. In our ionic liquid\nmodel systems, cations are modeled as dimers with positive charge, while anions\nare modeled as monomers with negative charge, respectively. To study the effect\nof the charge distributions on the cations, two ionic liquid models with\ndifferent charge distributions are used and the model with neutral charge is\nalso considered as a counterpart. To reveal the heterogeneous dynamics in the\nmodel systems, we examine spatial distributions of displacement and time\ndistributions of exchange and persistence times. All the models show\nsignificant increase of the dynamic heterogeneity as the temperature is\nlowered. The dynamic heterogeneity is quantified via the well-known four-point\nsusceptibility which measures the fluctuation of a time correlation function.\nThe dynamic correlation length is calculated by fitting the dynamic structure\nfactor, S4(k,t), with Ornstein-Zernike form at the time scale at which the\ndynamic heterogeneity reaches the maximum value. Obtained time and length\nscales exhibit a power law relation at the low temperatures, similar to various\nsupercooled liquid models. Especially, the charged model systems show unusual\ncrossover behaviors which are not observed in the uncharged model system. We\nascribe the crossover behavior to the enhanced cage effect caused by charges on\nthe particles.\n", "  Two-dimensional black phosphorus has been configured as field-effect\ntransistors, showing an intrinsic symmetric ambipolar transport characteristic.\nHere, we demonstrate the strongly modulated ambipolar characteristics of\nfew-layer black phosphorus in oxygen. Pure oxygen exposure can dramatically\ndecrease the electron mobility of black phosphorus without degrading the hole\ntransport. The transport characteristics can be nearly recovered upon annealing\nin Argon. This reveals that oxygen molecules are physisorbed on black\nphosphorus. In contrast, oxygen exposure upon light illumination exhibits a\nsignificant attenuation for both electron and hole transport, originating from\nthe photoactivated oxidation of black phosphorus, which is corroborated by in\nsitu X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization. Our findings clarify\nthe predominant role of oxygen in modulating ambipolar characteristics of black\nphosphorus, thereby providing deeper insight to the design of black phosphorus\nbased complementary electronics.\n", "  Cosmological hysteresis is a purely thermodynamical phenomenon caused by the\ngradient in pressure, hence the characteristic equation of state during the\nexpansion and contraction phases of the universe are different, provided that\nthe universe bounces and recollapses. During hysteresis pressure asymmetry is\ncreated due to the presence of a single scalar field in the dynamical process.\nAlso such an interesting scenario has vivid implications in cosmology when\napplied to variants of modified gravity models described within the framework\nof membrane paradigm. Cyclic universe along with scalar field leads to the\nincrease in the amplitude of the cosmological scale factor at each consecutive\ncycles of the universe. Detailed analysis shows that the conditions which\ncreates a universe with an ever increasing expansion, depend on the signature\nof the hysteresis loop integral $\\oint pdV$ and on membrane model parameters.\n", "  Doped band insulators, HfNCl, WO$_3$, diamond, Bi$_2$Se$_3$, \\bis2 families,\nSTO/LAO interface, gate doped SrTiO$_3$ and MoS$_2$ etc. are unusual\nsuperconductors. With an aim to build a general theory for superconductivity in\ndoped band insulators we focuss on \\bis2 family, discovered by Mizuguchi et al.\nin 2012. While maximum Tc is only $\\sim$ 11 K in \\laofx, a number of\nexperimental results are puzzling and anomalous; they resemble high Tc and\nunconventional superconductors. Using a two orbital model of Usui, Suzuki and\nKuroki we show that the uniform low density free fermi sea in \\laofh is\n\\textit{unstable towards formation of next nearest neighbor Bi-S-Bi diagonal\nvalence bond} (charge -2e Cooper pair) and their \\textit{Wigner\ncrystallization}. Instability to this novel state of matter is caused by\nunscreened nearest neighbor coulomb repulsions (V $\\sim$ 1 eV) and a hopping\npattern with sulfur mediated diagonal next nearest neighbor Bi-S-Bi hopping t'\n$\\sim$ 0.88 eV, larger than nearest neighbor Bi-Bi hopping, t $\\sim$ 0.16 eV.\nWigner crystal of Cooper pairs quantum melt for doping around x = 0.5 and\nstabilize certain resonating valence bond states and superconductivity. We\nstudy few variational RVB states and suggest that \\bis2 family members are\nlatent high Tc superconductors, but challenged by competing orders and fragile\nnature of manybody states sustained by unscreened Coulomb forces. One of our\nsuperconducting state has d$_{xy}$ symmetry and a gap. We also predict 2d\n\\textit{Bose metal or vortex liquid} normal state, as charge -2e valence bonds\nsurvive in the normal state.\n", "  Tunable spin correlations are found to arise between two neighboring trapped\nexciton-polariton condensates which spin-polarize spontaneously. We observe a\ncrossover from an antiferromagnetic- to a ferromagnetic pair state by reducing\nthe coupling barrier in real-time using control of the imprinted pattern of\npump light. Fast optical switching of both condensates is then achieved by\nresonantly but weakly triggering only a single condensate. These effects can be\nexplained as the competition between spin bifurcations and spin-preserving\nJosephson coupling between the two condensates, and open the way to polariton\nBose-Hubbard ladders.\n", "  We study the production of hadrons in nucleus-nucleus collisions within the\nParton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach that is extended to\nincorporate essentials aspects of chiral symmetry restoration (CSR) in the\nhadronic sector (via the Schwinger mechanism) on top of the deconfinement phase\ntransition as implemented in PHSD. The essential impact of CSR is found in the\nSchwinger mechanism (for string decay) which fixes the ratio of strange to\nlight quark production in the hadronic medium. Our studies provide a\nmicroscopic explanation for the maximum in the $K^+/\\pi^+$ ratio at about 30 A\nGeV which only shows up if in addition to CSR a deconfinement transition to\npartonic degrees-of-freedom is incorporated in the reaction dynamics.\n", "  We consider the question here whether the proposed electromagnetic\ncounterpart of the gravitational wave signals in binary black hole coalescence\nmay be due to the appearance of a `short lived' naked singularity during the\nmerger. We point out that the change in topology that the spacetime undergoes\nduring the merger can cause the appearance of a naked singularity. In case some\nmatter, in the form of a small accretion disk, is present in the surroundings\nof the black hole system then the emitted luminosity during the merger would\nallow to distinguish the scenario where the naked singularity forms from the\nscenario where the horizon exists at all times. In fact the emitted luminosity\nspectrum would be much higher in the case where a naked singularity forms as\nopposed to the `pure' black hole case. We suggest that the presence of such a\ntransient naked singularity will explain the high luminosity of an\nelectromagnetic counterpart during the merger much more easily.\n", "  The ABC flow was originally introduced by Arnol'd to investigate Lagrangian\nchaos. It soon became the prototype example to illustrate magnetic-field\namplification via fast dynamo action, i.e. dynamo action exhibiting\nmagnetic-field amplification on a typical timescale independent of the\nelectrical resistivity of the medium. Even though this flow is the most\nclassical example for this important class of dynamos (with application to\nlarge-scale astrophysical objects), it was recently pointed out (Bouya Isma\\\"el\nand Dormy Emmanuel, Phys. Fluids, 25 (2013) 037103) that the fast dynamo nature\nof this flow was unclear, as the growth rate still depended on the magnetic\nReynolds number at the largest values available so far $(\\text{Rm} = 25000)$ .\nUsing state-of-the-art high-performance computing, we present high-resolution\nsimulations (up to 40963) and extend the value of $\\text{Rm}$ up to $\n5\\cdot10^5$ . Interestingly, even at these huge values, the growth rate of the\nleading eigenmode still depends on the controlling parameter and an asymptotic\nregime is not reached yet. We show that the maximum growth rate is a decreasing\nfunction of $\\text{Rm}$ for the largest values of $\\text{Rm}$ we could achieve\n(as anticipated in the above-mentioned paper). Slowly damped oscillations might\nindicate either a new mode crossing or that the system is approaching the limit\nof an essential spectrum.\n", "  Understanding the relation between planned and realized flight trajectories\nand the determinants of flight deviations is of great importance in air traffic\nmanagement. In this paper we perform an in depth investigation of the\nstatistical properties of planned and realized air traffic on the German\nairspace during a 28 day periods, corresponding to an AIRAC cycle. We find that\nrealized trajectories are on average shorter than planned ones and this effect\nis stronger during night-time than daytime. Flights are more frequently\ndeviated close to the departure airport and at a relatively large angle to\ndestination. Moreover, the probability of a deviation is higher in low traffic\nphases. All these evidences indicate that deviations are mostly used by\ncontrollers to give directs to flights when traffic conditions allow it.\nFinally we introduce a new metric, termed difork, which is able to characterize\nnavigation points according to the likelihood that a deviation occurs there.\nDifork allows to identify in a statistically rigorous way navigation point\npairs where deviations are more (less) frequent than expected under a null\nhypothesis of randomness that takes into account the heterogeneity of the\nnavigation points. Such pairs can therefore be seen as sources of flexibility\n(stability) of controllers traffic management while conjugating safety and\nefficiency.\n", "  In anticipation of the Gaia astrometric mission, a large sample of\nspectroscopic binaries has been observed since 2010 with the SOPHIE\nspectrograph at the Haute--Provence Observatory. Our aim is to derive the\norbital elements of double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2s) with an accuracy\nsufficient to finally obtain the masses of the components with relative errors\nas small as 1 % when the astrometric measurements of Gaia are taken into\naccount. In this paper we present the results from five years of observations\nof 10 SB2 systems with periods ranging from 37 to 881 days. Using the TODMOR\nalgorithm we computed radial velocities from the spectra, and then derived the\norbital elements of these binary systems. The minimum masses of the components\nare then obtained with an accuracy better than 1.2 % for the ten binaries.\nCombining the radial velocities with existing interferometric measurements, we\nderived the masses of the primary and secondary components of HIP 87895 with an\naccuracy of 0.98 % and 1.2 % respectively.\n", "  The phase diagram of dense QCD at nonvanishing temperatures and large quark\nchemical potentials is studied with Dyson-Schwinger equations for 2+1 quark\nflavors, focusing on color-superconducting phases with 2SC and CFL-like\npairing. The truncation scheme of our previous investigations is extended to\ninclude the dressing of gluons with selfconsistently determined quarks, i.e.,\ntaking into account the dynamical masses and superconducting gaps of the quarks\nin the gluon polarization. As a consequence the gluon screening is reduced,\nleading to an enhancement of the critical temperatures of the\ncolor-superconducting phases by about a factor of 2 as compared to the case\nwhere the gluons are dressed with bare quarks. We also calculate the Debye and\nMeissner masses of the gluons and show that they are consistent with\nweak-coupling results.\n", "  Radio telescope front ends must have simultaneously low noise and\nsufficiently-high linearity to accommodate interfering signals. Typically these\nare opposing design goals. For modern radio telescopes operating in the HF\n(3-30 MHz) and VHF-low (30-88 MHz) bands, the problem is more nuanced in that\nfront end noise temperature may be a relatively small component of the system\ntemperature, and increased linearity may be required due to the particular\ninterference problems associated with this spectrum. In this paper we present\nan analysis of the sensitivity-linearity trade off at these frequencies,\napplicable to existing commercially-available monolithic microwave integrated\ncircuit (MMIC) amplifiers in single-ended, differential, and parallelized\nconfigurations. This analysis and associated findings should be useful in the\ndesign and upgrade of front ends for low frequency radio telescopes. The\nanalysis is demonstrated explicitly for one of the better-performing amplifiers\nencountered in this study, the Mini-Circuits PGA-103, and is confirmed by\nhardware measurements. We also present a design based on the Mini-Circuits\nHELA-10 amplifier, which is better-suited for applications where linearity is a\nprimary concern.\n", "  Magnetic doping is expected to open a band gap at the Dirac point of\ntopological insulators by breaking time-reversal symmetry and to enable novel\ntopological phases. Epitaxial (Bi$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$)$_{2}$Se$_{3}$ is a\nprototypical magnetic topological insulator with a pronounced surface band gap\nof $\\sim100$ meV. We show that this gap is neither due to ferromagnetic order\nin the bulk or at the surface nor to the local magnetic moment of the Mn,\nmaking the system unsuitable for realizing the novel phases. We further show\nthat Mn doping does not affect the inverted bulk band gap and the system\nremains topologically nontrivial. We suggest that strong resonant scattering\nprocesses cause the gap at the Dirac point and support this by the observation\nof in-gap states using resonant photoemission. Our findings establish a novel\nmechanism for gap opening in topological surface states which challenges the\ncurrently known conditions for topological protection.\n", "  The friction and diffusion coefficients of rigid spherical colloidal\nparticles dissolved in a fluid are determined from velocity and force\nautocorrelation functions by mesoscale hydrodynamic simulations. Colloids with\nboth slip and no-slip boundary conditions are considered, which are embedded in\nfluids modelled by multiparticle collision dynamics (MPC) with and without\nangular momentum conservation. For no-slip boundary conditions, hydrodynamics\nyields the well-known Stokes law, while for slip boundary conditions the lack\nof angular momentum conservation leads to a reduction of the hydrodynamic\nfriction coefficient compared to the classical result. The colloid diffusion\ncoefficient is determined by integration of the velocity autocorrelation\nfunction, where the numerical result at shorter times is combined with the\ntheoretical hydrodynamic expression for longer times. The suitability of this\napproach is confirmed by simulations of sedimenting colloids. In general, we\nfind only minor deviations from the Stokes-Einstein relation, which even\ndisappear for larger colloids. Importantly, for colloids with slip boundary\nconditions, our simulation results contradict the frequently assumed additivity\nof local and hydrodynamic diffusion coefficients.\n", "  Superconductivity is observed with critical temperatures near 9K in the\ntetragonal compound Mo5PB2. This material adopts the Cr5B3 structure type\ncommon to supercondcuting Nb5Si3-xBx, Mo5SiB2, and W5SiB2, which have critical\ntemperatures of 5.8-7.8 K. We have synthesized polycrystalline samples of the\ncompound, made measurements of electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility,\nand heat capacity, and performed first principles electronic structure\ncalculations. The highest Tc value (9.2 K) occurs in slightly phosphorus rich\nsamples, with composition near Mo5P1.1B1.9, and the upper critical field Hc2 at\nT = 0 is estimated to be about 17 kOe. Together, the measurements and band\nstructure calculations indicate intermediate coupling (lambda = 1.0), phonon\nmediated superconductivity. The temperature dependence of the heat capacity and\nupper critical field Hc2 below Tc suggest multiple superconducting gaps may be\npresent.\n", "  Physisorbed atoms on the surface of interstellar dust grains play a central\nrole in solid state astrochemistry. Their surface reactivity is one source of\nthe observed molecular complexity in space. In experimental astrophysics, the\nhigh reactivity of atoms also constitutes an obstacle to measuring two of the\nfundamental properties in surface physics, namely desorption and diffusion\nenergies, and so far direct measurements are non-existent for O and N atoms. We\ninvestigated the diffusion and desorption processes of O and N atoms on cold\nsurfaces in order to give boundary conditions to astrochemical models. Here we\npropose a new technique for directly measuring the N- and O-atom mass signals.\nIncluding the experimental results in a simple model allows us to almost\ndirectly derive the desorption and diffusion barriers of N atoms on amorphous\nsolid water ice (ASW) and O atoms on ASW and oxidized graphite. We find a\nstrong constraint on the values of desorption and thermal diffusion energy\nbarriers. The measured barriers for O atoms are consistent with recent\nindependent estimations and prove to be much higher than previously believed\n(E$_{des}=1410_{-160}^{+290}$; E$_{dif}=990_{-360}^{+530}$ K on ASW). As for\noxygen atoms, we propose that the combination E$_{des}$-E$_{dif}$=1320-750 K is\na sensible choice among the possible pairs of solutions. Also, we managed to\nmeasure the desorption and diffusion energy of N atoms for the first time\n(E$_{des}=720_{-80}^{+160}$; E$_{dif}=525_{-200}^{+260}$ K on ASW) in the\nthermal hopping regime and propose that the combination\nE$_{des}$-E$_{dif}$=720-400 K can be reasonably adopted in models. The value of\nE$_{dif}$ for N atoms is slightly lower than previously suggested, which\nimplies that the N chemistry on dust grains might be richer.\n", "  We make use of the well-known properties of spontaneous decays of stationary\nstates of bound systems of elementary particles to support the view that the\nforces which form these systems propagate instantaneously at the moment of\ntheir decay.\n", "  Twisted Laguerre-Gaussian lasers, with orbital angular momentum and\ncharacterised by doughnut shaped intensity profiles, provide a transformative\nset of tools and research directions in a growing range of fields and\napplications, from super-resolution microcopy and ultra-fast optical\ncommunications to quantum computing and astrophysics. The impact of twisted\nlight is widening as recent numerical calculations provided solutions to\nlong-standing challenges in plasma-based acceleration by allowing for high\ngradient positron acceleration. The production of ultrahigh intensity twisted\nlaser pulses could then also have a broad influence on relativistic\nlaser-matter interactions. Here we show theoretically and with ab-initio\nthree-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, that stimulated Raman\nbackscattering can generate and amplify twisted lasers to Petawatt intensities\nin plasmas. This work may open new research directions in non-linear optics and\nhigh energy density science, compact plasma based accelerators and light\nsources.\n", "  A new type of the graphene-based three-port circulator is suggested and\nanalysed. The cross-section of the component presents a three-layer structure\nconsisting of a layer of silicon, of silica and of graphene. In-plane figure\nresembles a common microwave nanostrip circulator with a circular graphene\nresonator and three waveguides symmetrically connected to it. The graphene is\nmagnetized normally to its plane by a DC magnetic field. The numerical\nsimulation demonstrates the isolation of -15 dB and insertion losses of -2 dB\nin 6.98 \\% frequency band with the central frequency 8.23THz.\n", "  Using in-situ Raman scattering from phosphorene channel in an\nelectrochemically top-gated field effect transistor, we show that its phonons\nwith A$_g$ symmetry depend much more strongly on concentration of electrons\nthan that of holes, while the phonons with B$_g$ symmetry are insensitive to\ndoping. With first-principles theoretical analysis, we show that the observed\nelecton-hole asymmetry arises from the radically different constitution of its\nconduction and valence bands involving $\\pi$ and $\\sigma$ bonding states\nrespectively, whose symmetry permits coupling with only the phonons that\npreserve the lattice symmetry. Thus, Raman spectroscopy is a non-invasive tool\nfor measuring electron concentration in phosphorene-based nanoelectronic\ndevices.\n", "  We describe a study in which introductory physics students engage in\nreflection with peers about problem solving. The recitations for an\nintroductory physics course with 200 students were broken into the \"Peer\nReflection\" (PR) group and the traditional group. Each week in recitation,\nstudents in the PR group reflected in small teams on selected problems from the\nhomework. The graduate and undergraduate teaching assistants (TAs) in the PR\ngroup recitations provided guidance and coaching to help students learn\neffective problem solving heuristics. In the recitations for the traditional\ngroup, students had the opportunity to ask the graduate TA questions about the\nhomework before they took a weekly quiz. On the final exam with only\nmultiple-choice questions, the PR group drew diagrams on more problems than the\ntraditional group, even when there was no external reward for doing so. Since\nthere was no partial credit for drawing the diagrams on the scratch books,\nstudents did not draw diagrams simply to get credit for the effort shown and\nmust value the use of diagrams for solving problems if they drew them. We also\nfind that, regardless of whether the students belonged to the traditional or PR\ngroups, those who drew more diagrams for the multiple-choice questions\noutperformed those who did not draw them.\n", "  We discuss the effect of administering conceptual and quantitative isomorphic\nproblem pairs (CQIPP) back to back vs. asking students to solve only one of the\nproblems in the CQIPP in introductory physics courses. Students who answered\nboth questions in a CQIPP often performed better on the conceptual questions\nthan those who answered the corresponding conceptual questions only. Although\nstudents often took advantage of the quantitative counterpart to answer a\nconceptual question of a CQIPP correctly, when only given the conceptual\nquestion, students seldom tried to convert it into a quantitative question,\nsolve it and then reason about the solution conceptually. Even in individual\ninterviews, when students who were only given conceptual questions had\ndifficulty and the interviewer explicitly encouraged them to convert the\nconceptual question into the corresponding quantitative problem by choosing\nappropriate variables, a majority of students were reluctant and preferred to\nguess the answer to the conceptual question based upon their gut feeling.\n", "  The ability to categorize problems is a measure of expertise in a domain. In\norder to help students learn effectively, instructors and teaching assistants\n(TAs) should have pedagogical content knowledge. They must be aware of the\nprior knowledge of students they are teaching, consider the difficulty of the\nproblems from students' perspective and design instruction that builds on what\nstudents already know. Here, we discuss the response of graduate students\nenrolled in a TA training course to categorization tasks in which they were\nasked to group problems based upon similarity of solution first from their own\nperspective, and later from the perspective of introductory physics students.\nMany graduate students performed an expert-like categorization of introductory\nphysics problems. However, when asked to categorize the same problems from the\nperspective of introductory students, many graduate students expressed dismay,\nclaiming that the task was impossible, pointless and had no relevance to their\nTA duties. We will discuss how categorization can be a useful tool for\nscaffolding and improving pedagogical content knowledge of teaching assistants\nand instructors.\n", "  We discuss the categorization of 20 quantum mechanics problems by physics\nprofessors and undergraduate students from two honors-level quantum mechanics\ncourses. Professors and students were asked to categorize the problems based\nupon similarity of solution. We also had individual discussions with professors\nwho categorized the problems. Faculty members' categorizations were overall\nrated higher than those of students by three faculty members who evaluated all\nof the categorizations. The categories created by faculty members were more\ndiverse compared to the categories they created for a set of introductory\nmechanics problems. Some faculty members noted that the categorization of\nintroductory physics problems often involves identifying fundamental principles\nrelevant for the problem, whereas in upper-level undergraduate quantum\nmechanics problems, it mainly involves identifying concepts and procedures\nrequired to solve the problem. Moreover, physics faculty members who evaluated\nothers' categorizations expressed that the task was very challenging and they\nsometimes found another person's categorization to be better than their own.\nThey also rated some concrete categories such as \"hydrogen atom\" or \"simple\nharmonic oscillator\" higher than other concrete categories such as \"infinite\nsquare well\" or \"free particle\".\n", "  We discuss the categorization of 20 quantum mechanics problems by 6 physics\nprofessors and 22 undergraduate students from two honors-level quantum\nmechanics courses. Professors and students were asked to categorize the\nproblems based upon similarity of solution. We also had individual discussions\nwith professors who categorized the problems. Faculty members' categorizations\nwere overall rated better than those of students by three faculty members who\nevaluated all of the categorizations. But the categories created by faculty\nmembers were more diverse compared to the uniformity of the categories they\ncreated when asked to categorize introductory mechanics problems.\n", "  We discuss the development, implementation, and assessment of a course for\nscience undergraduates designed to help them develop an awareness and a deeper\nappreciation of the intellectual demands of physics teaching. The course\nfocused on increasing student enthusiasm and confidence in teaching by\nproviding well supported teaching opportunities and exposure to physics\neducation research. The course assessment methods include 1) pre/post-tests\nmeasures of attitude and expectations about science teaching, 2) self and peer\nevaluation of student teaching, 3) content-based pre/post-tests given to\nstudents who received instruction from the student teachers, and 4) audio-taped\nfocus group discussions in the absence of the instructor and TA to evaluate\nstudent perspective on different aspects of the course and its impact.\n", "  Recruiting and retaining highly qualified physics and physical science\nteachers is critical for maintaining America's global competitiveness.\nUnfortunately, only one third of the high school teachers in physics have a\ndegree in physics and an even smaller number of physical science teachers in\nmiddle school have a good grasp of the scientific content they teach. Moreover,\nteachers often lack adequate pedagogical content knowledge to teach science\neffectively. Here, we discuss the development, implementation, and assessment\nof a course for science and engineering undergraduates designed to increase\nawareness and help them develop an interest and a deeper appreciation of the\nintellectual demands of physics teaching. The course focused on increasing\nstudent enthusiasm and confidence in teaching by providing well supported\nteaching opportunities and exposure to physics education research.

We showed that the ground state\nof the material exhibits the ordered patterns of the electronic localization\nwhich are mainly associated with iron $3d_{x^2 - y^2}$ orbitals and can be\ncharacterized in terms of nematic-like ordering. The ordering is the result of\nthe close interplay of the lattice and the electron degrees of freedom. In a\nstructural aspect, it pursues an energy quest to select the orthorhombic\ncrystal lattice attributed to the Pnnm space group. In a charge aspect, the\nordering is connected with the valence charge density redistribution that not\nonly provides a high electronic polarizability but also gives rise to an\nextra-large magnitude of the negative component of the dynamical p-d charge\ntransfer.\n", "  Periodic travelling waves are considered in the class of reduced Ostrovsky\nequations that describe low-frequency internal waves in the presence of\nrotation. The reduced Ostrovsky equations with either quadratic or cubic\nnonlinearities can be transformed to integrable equations of the Klein--Gordon\ntype by means of a change of coordinates. By using the conserved momentum and\nenergy as well as an additional conserved quantity due to integrability, we\nprove that small-amplitude periodic waves are orbitally stable with respect to\nsubharmonic perturbations, with period equal to an integer multiple of the\nperiod of the wave. The proof is based on construction of a Lyapunov\nfunctional, which is convex at the periodic wave and is conserved in the time\nevolution. We also show numerically that convexity of the Lyapunov functional\nholds for periodic waves of arbitrary amplitudes.\n", "  The next generation BLAST experiment (BLAST-TNG) is a suborbital balloon\npayload that seeks to map polarized dust emission in the 250 $\\mu$m, 350 $\\mu$m\nand 500 $\\mu$m wavebands. The instrument utilizes a stepped half-wave plate to\nreduce systematics. The general requirement of the detectors is that they are\nphoton-noise-limited and dual-polarization sensitive. To achieve this goal, we\nare developing three monolithic arrays of cryogenic sensors, one for each\nwaveband. Each array is feedhorn-coupled and each spatial pixel consists of two\northogonally spaced polarization-sensitive microwave kinetic inductance\ndetectors (MKIDs) fabricated from a Ti/TiN multilayer film. In previous work,\nwe demonstrated photon-noise-limited sensitivity in 250 $\\mu$m waveband single\npolarization devices. In this work, we present the first results of\ndual-polarization sensitive MKIDs at 250 $\\mu$m.\n", "  This article considers the quasi-local conserved quantities with respect to a\nreference spacetime with a cosmological constant. We follow the approach\ndeveloped by the authors in [25,26,7] and define the quasi-local energy as\ndifferences of surface Hamiltonians. The ground state for the gravitational\nenergy is taken to be a reference configuration in the de Sitter (dS) or\nAnti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. This defines the quasi-local energy with\nrespect to the reference spacetime and generalizes our previous definition with\nrespect to the Minkowski spacetime. Through an optimal isometric embedding into\nthe reference spacetime, the Killing fields of the reference spacetime are\ntransplanted back to the surface in the physical spacetime to complete the\ndefinitions of quasi-local conserved quantities. We also compute how the\ncorresponding total conserved quantities evolve under the Einstein equation\nwith a cosmological constant.\n", "  Laser plasma interaction with micro-engineered targets at relativistic\nintensities has been greatly promoted by recent progress in the high contrast\nlasers and the manufacture of advanced micro- and nano-structures. This opens\nnew possibilities for the physics of laser-matter interaction. Here we propose\na novel approach that leverages the advantages of high-pressure CO$_{2}$ laser,\nlaser-waveguide interaction, as well as micro-engineered plasma structure to\naccelerate electrons to peak energy greater than 1 GeV with narrow slice energy\nspread ($\\sim1\\%$) and high overall efficiency. The acceleration gradient is 26\nGV/m for a 1.3 TW CO$_{2}$ laser system. The micro-bunching of a long electron\nbeam leads to the generation of a chain of ultrashort electron bunches with the\nduration roughly equal to half-laser-cycle. These results open a way for\ndeveloping a compact and economic electron source for diverse applications.\n", "  Every physical theory has (at least) two different forms of mathematical\nequations to represent its target systems: the dynamical (equations of motion)\nand the kinematical (kinematical constraints). Kinematical constraints are\ndifferentiated from equations of motion by the fact that their particular form\nis fixed once and for all, irrespective of the interactions the system enters\ninto. By contrast, the particular form of a system's equations of motion\ndepends essentially on the particular interaction the system enters into. All\ncontemporary accounts of the structure and semantics of physical theory treat\ndynamics, i.e., the equations of motion, as the most important feature of a\ntheory for the purposes of its philosophical analysis. I argue to the contrary\nthat it is the kinematical constraints that determine the structure and\nempirical content of a physical theory in the most important ways: they\nfunction as necessary preconditions for the appropriate application of the\ntheory; they differentiate types of physical systems; they are necessary for\nthe equations of motion to be well posed or even just cogent; and they guide\nthe experimentalist in the design of tools for measurement and observation. It\nis thus satisfaction of the kinematical constraints that renders meaning to\nthose terms representing a system's physical quantities in the first place,\neven before one can ask whether or not the system satisfies the theory's\nequations of motion.\n", "  We present the first near-IR milli-arcsecond-scale image of a post-AGB binary\nthat is surrounded by hot circumbinary dust. A very rich interferometric data\nset in six spectral channels was acquired of IRAS08544-4431 with the new RAPID\ncamera on the PIONIER beam combiner at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer\n(VLTI). A broadband image in the \\textit{H} band was reconstructed by combining\nthe data of all spectral channels using the SPARCO method. We spatially\nseparate all the building blocks of the IRAS08544-4431 system in our\nmilliarcsecond-resolution image. Our dissection reveals a dust sublimation\nfront that is strikingly similar to that expected in early-stage protoplanetary\ndisks, as well as an unexpected flux signal of $\\sim$4\\% from the secondary\nstar. The energy output from this companion indicates the presence of a compact\ncircum-companion accretion disk, which is likely the origin of the fast outflow\ndetected in H$\\alpha$. Our image provides the most detailed view into the heart\nof a dusty circumstellar disk to date. Our results demonstrate that binary\nevolution processes and circumstellar disk evolution can be studied in detail\nin space and over time.\n", "  A Bayesian approach to solar flare prediction has been developed, which uses\nonly the event statistics of flares already observed. The method is simple,\nobjective, and makes few ad hoc assumptions. It is argued that this approach\nshould be used to provide a baseline prediction for certain space weather\npurposes, upon which other methods, incorporating additional information, can\nimprove. A practical implementation of the method for whole-Sun prediction of\nGeostationary Observational Environment Satellite (GOES) events is described in\ndetail, and is demonstrated for 4 November 2003, the day of the largest\nrecorded GOES flare. A test of the method is described based on the historical\nrecord of GOES events (1975-2003), and a detailed comparison is made with US\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predictions for\n1987-2003. Although the NOAA forecasts incorporate a variety of other\ninformation, the present method out-performs the NOAA method in predicting mean\nnumbers of event days, for both M-X and X events. Skill scores and other\nmeasures show that the present method is slightly less accurate at predicting\nM-X events than the NOAA method, but substantially more accurate at predicting\nX events, which are important contributors to space weather.\n", "  The corrections of the gluon fusion to the BFKL equation in a unified\npartonic framework are studied. This modified BFKL equation predicts a stronger\nshadowing, which suppresses the gluon density and even leads to the gluon\ndisappearance below the saturation region. We suggest that this unexpected\neffect is caused by a possible chaotic solution of the new equation.\n", "  By solving the two variable differential equations which arise from finding\nthe eigenfunctions for the Casimir operator for $O(d,2)$ succinct expressions\nare found for the functions, conformal partial waves, representing the\ncontribution of an operator of arbitrary scale dimension $\\Delta$ and spin\n$\\ell$ together with its descendants to conformal four point functions for\n$d=4$, recovering old results, and also for $d=6$. The results are expressed in\nterms of ordinary hypergeometric functions of variables $x,z$ which are simply\nrelated to the usual conformal invariants. An expression for the conformal\npartial wave amplitude valid for any dimension is also found in terms of a sum\nover two variable symmetric Jack polynomials which is used to derive relations\nfor the conformal partial waves.\n", "  The purpose of this dissertation is to introduce a version of Stein's method\nof exchangeable pairs to solve problems in measure concentration. We\nspecifically target systems of dependent random variables, since that is where\nthe power of Stein's method is fully realized. Because the theory is quite\nabstract, we have tried to put in as many examples as possible. Some of the\nhighlighted applications are as follows: (a) We shall find an easily verifiable\ncondition under which a popular heuristic technique originating from physics,\nknown as the \"mean field equations\" method, is valid. No such condition is\ncurrently known. (b) We shall present a way of using couplings to derive\nconcentration inequalities. Although couplings are routinely used for proving\ndecay of correlations, no method for using couplings to derive concentration\nbounds is available in the literature. This will be used to obtain (c)\nconcentration inequalities with explicit constants under Dobrushin's condition\nof weak dependence. (d) We shall give a method for obtaining concentration of\nHaar measures using convergence rates of related random walks on groups. Using\nthis technique and one of the numerous available results about rates of\nconvergence of random walks, we will then prove (e) a quantitative version of\nVoiculescu's celebrated connection between random matrix theory and free\nprobability.\n"]}
