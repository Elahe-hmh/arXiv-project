This yields an alternative to inflation\nfor explaining the formation of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the\nlarge scale structure (LSS) of the universe. We make use of the $\\delta{\\cal\nN}$ formalism to identify signatures of primordial nonlinear fluctuations, and\nthis allows the VSL model to be distinguished from inflationary models. In\nparticular, we find that the parameter $f_{\\rm NL}=5$ in the variable speed of\nlight cosmology. The value of the parameter $g_{\\rm NL}$ evolves during the\nprimordial era and shows a running behavior.\n"]}
