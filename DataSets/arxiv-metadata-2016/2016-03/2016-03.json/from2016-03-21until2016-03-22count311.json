and Poincar\\'e groups of changes of\nspace-time coordinates. The method is simple but rigorous. The meaning of each\nstep is clear because it corresponds to an operation in the group of changes of\nspace-time coordinates. Only products and inverses are used; differences are\nnot used. It is made explicitly clear why constants occur in some bracket\nrelations but not in others, and how some constants can be removed, so that in\nthe end there is a constant in the bracket relations for the Galilei group but\nnot for the Poincar\\'e group. Each change of coordinates needs to be only to\nfirst order, so matrices are not needed for rotations or Lorentz\ntransformations; simple three-vector descriptions are enough.\n  Conversion to quantum mechanics is immediate. One result is a simpler\nderivation of the commutation relations for angular momentum directly from\nrotations. Problems are included.\n", "  The discovery of superconductivity in LaFeAsO introduced the ferropnictides\nas a major new class of superconducting compounds with critical temperatures\nsecond only to cuprates. The presence of magnetic iron makes ferropnictides\nradically different from cuprates. Antiferromagnetism of the parent compounds\nstrongly suggests that superconductivity and magnetism are closely related.\nHowever, the character of magnetic interactions and spin fluctuations in\nferropnictides, in spite of vigorous efforts, has until now resisted\nunderstanding within any conventional model of magnetism. Here we show that the\nmost puzzling features can be naturally reconciled within a rather simple\neffective spin model with biquadratic interactions, which is consistent with\nelectronic structure calculations. By going beyond the Heisenberg model, this\ndescription explains numerous experimentally observed properties, including the\npeculiarities of the spin wave spectrum, thin domain walls, crossover from\nfirst to second order phase transition under doping in some compounds, and\noffers new insight in the occurrence of the nematic phase above the\nantiferromagnetic phase transition.\n", "  We study optimal double helices with straight axes (or the fattest tubes\naround them) computationally using three kinds of functionals; ideal ones using\nropelength, best volume packing ones, and energy minimizers using two\none-parameter families of interaction energies between two strands of types\n$r^{-\\alpha}$ and $\\frac1r\\exp(-kr)$. We compare the numerical results with\nexperimental data of DNA.\n", "  This work uses Lorentz-signature in-in perturbation theory to analyze the\nlate-time behavior of correlators in time-dependent interacting massive scalar\nfield theory in de Sitter space. We study a scenario recently considered by\nKrotov and Polyakov in which the coupling $g$ turns on smoothly at finite time,\nstarting from $g=0$ in the far past where the state is taken to be the (free)\nBunch-Davies vacuum. Our main result is that the resulting correlators (which\nwe compute at the one-loop level) approach those of the interacting\nHartle-Hawking state at late times. We argue that similar results should hold\nfor other physically-motivated choices of initial conditions. This behavior is\nto be expected from recent quantum \"no hair\" theorems for interacting massive\nscalar field theory in de Sitter space which established similar results to all\norders in perturbation theory for a dense set of states in the Hilbert space.\nOur current work i) indicates that physically motivated initial conditions lie\nin this dense set, ii) provides a Lorentz-signature counter-part to the\nEuclidean techniques used to prove such theorems, and iii) provides an explicit\nexample of the relevant renormalization techniques.\n", "  We present a scenario for building the equatorial ridge and de-spinning\nIapetus through an impact-generated disk and satellite. This impact puts debris\ninto orbit, forming a ring inside the Roche limit and a satellite outside. This\nsatellite rapidly pushes the ring material down to the surface of Iapetus, and\nthen itself tidally evolves outward, thereby helping to de-spin Iapetus. This\nscenario can de-spin Iapetus an order of magnitude faster than when tides due\nto Saturn act alone, almost independently of its interior geophysical\nevolution. Eventually, the satellite is stripped from its orbit by Saturn. The\nrange of satellite and impactor masses required is compatible with the\nestimated impact history of Iapetus.\n", "  We study the configuration space of equilateral and equiangular spatial\nhexagons for any bond angle by giving explicit expressions of all the possible\nshapes. We show that the chair configuration is isolated, whereas the boat\nconfiguration allows one-dimensional deformations which form a circle in the\nconfiguration space.\n", "  Economical extensions of the Standard Model (SM), in which the famous\nDavidson-Ibarra bound on the CP asymmetry relevant for leptogenesis may be\nsignificantly relaxed by the loop effects, comparing to predictions of the SM\nextended only by right-handed neutrinos with hierarchical masses, are\ndiscussed. This leads to decreasing of the lower bound on the heavy neutrino\nmasses and increasing of the upper bound on the light neutrino masses. In\naddition, the considered theory may help to solve the dark matter problem.\n", "  The two-point function of linearized gravitons on de Sitter space is infrared\ndivergent in the standard transverse traceless synchronous gauge defined by\n$k=0$ cosmological coordinates (also called conformal or Poincare coordinates).\nWe show that this divergence can be removed by adding a linearized\ndiffeomorphism to each mode function; i.e., by an explicit change of gauge. It\nfollows that the graviton vacuum state is well-defined and de Sitter invariant\nin agreement with various earlier arguments.\n", "  The geometry of the generalized Bloch sphere $\\Omega_3$, the state space of a\nqutrit, is studied. Closed form expressions for $\\Omega_3$, its boundary\n$\\partial \\Omega_3$, and the set of extremals $\\Omega_3^{\\rm ext}$ are obtained\nby use of an elementary observation. These expressions and analytic methods are\nused to classify the 28 two-sections and the 56 three-sections of $\\Omega_3$\ninto unitary equivalence classes, completing the works of earlier authors. It\nis shown, in particular, that there are families of two-sections and of\nthree-sections which are equivalent geometrically but not unitarily, a feature\nthat does not appear to have been appreciated earlier. A family of\nthree-sections of obese-tetrahedral shape whose symmetry corresponds to the\n24-element tetrahedral point group $T_d$ is examined in detail. This symmetry\nis traced to the natural reduction of the adjoint representation of $SU(3)$,\nthe symmetry underlying $\\Omega_3$, into direct sum of the two-dimensional and\nthe two (inequivalent) three-dimensional irreducible representations of $T_d$.\n", "  It is a commonplace that any theory can be written in any coordinates via\ntensor calculus. But it is claimed that spinors as such cannot be represented\nin coordinates in a curved space-time. What general covariance means for\ntheories with fermions is thus unclear. In fact both commonplaces are wrong.\nThough it is not widely known, Ogievetsky and Polubarinov (OP) constructed\nspinors in coordinates in 1965, helping to spawn nonlinear group\nrepresentations. Locally, these spinors resemble the orthonormal basis or\n\"tetrad\" formalism in the symmetric gauge, but they are conceptually\nself-sufficient. The tetrad formalism is de-Ockhamized, with 6 extra fields and\n6 compensating gauge symmetries. OP spinors, as developed nonperturbatively by\nBilyalov, admit any coordinates at a point, but \"time\" must be listed first:\nthe product of the metric components and the matrix diag(-1,1,1,1) must have no\nnegative eigenvalues to yield a real symmetric square root function of the\nmetric. Thus the admissible coordinates depend on the types and values of the\nfields. Apart from coordinate order and spinorial two-valuedness, OP spinors\nform, with the metric, a nonlinear geometric object, with Lie and covariant\nderivatives. Such spinors avoid a spurious absolute object in the\nAnderson-Friedman analysis of substantive general covariance. They also permit\nthe gauge-invariant localization of the infinite-component gravitational energy\nin GR. Density-weighted spinors exploit the conformal invariance of the\nmassless Dirac equation to show that the volume element is absent. Thus instead\nof a matrix with 16 components, one can use weighted OP spinors coupled to the\n9-component symmetric unimodular square root of the conformal metric density.\nThe surprising mildness of the restrictions on coordinates for the\nSchwarzschild solution is exhibited. (edited)\n", "  In the paper, we discuss the studies of mathematical models of diffusion\nscattering of waves in the phase space, and relation of these models with\nquantum mechanics. In the previous works it is shown that in these models of\nclassical scattering process of waves, the quantum mechanical description\narises as the asymptotics after a small time. In this respect, the proposed\nmodels can be considered as examples in which the quantum descriptions arise as\napproximate ones for certain hypothetical reality. The deviation between the\nproposed models and the quantum ones can arise, for example, for processes with\nrapidly changing potential function. Under its action the diffusion scattering\nprocess of waves will go out from the states described by quantum mechanics.\n  In the paper it is shown that the proposed models of diffusion scattering of\nwaves possess the property of gauge invariance. This implies that they are\ndescribed similarly in all inertial coordinate systems, i.e., they are\ninvariant under the Galileo transformations.\n  We propose a program of further research.\n", "  We report a non-detection, to a limiting magnitude of V = 18.4 (9), of the\nelusive entity commonly described as the Tooth Fairy. We review various\nphysical models and conclude that follow-up observations must precede an\ninterpretation of our result.\n", "  In this paper, we show that the Jacobiator $J$ of a pre-Courant algebroid is\nclosed naturally. The corresponding equivalence class $[J^\\flat]$ is defined as\nthe Pontryagin class, which is the obstruction of a pre-Courant algebroid to be\ndeformed into a Courant algebroid. We construct a Leibniz 2-algebra and a Lie\n2-algebra associated to a pre-Courant algebroid and prove that these algebraic\nstructures are isomorphic under deformations. Finally, we introduce the twisted\naction of a Lie algebra on a manifold to give more examples of pre-Courant\nalgebroids, which include the Cartan geometry.\n", "  We investigate the influence of stellar bulges on the star formation and\nmorphology of disc galaxies that suffer from ram pressure. Several tree-SPH\n(smoothed particle hydrodynamics) simulations have been carried out to study\nthe dependence of the star formation rate on the mass and size of a stellar\nbulge. In addition, different strengths of ram pressure and different\nalignments of the disc with respect to the intra-cluster medium (ICM) are\napplied. As claimed in previous works, when ram pressure is acting on a galaxy,\nthe star formation rate (SFR) is enhanced and rises up to four times with\nincreasing ICM density compared to galaxies that evolve in isolation. However,\na bulge suppresses the SFR when the same ram pressure is applied. Consequently,\nfewer new stars are formed because the SFR can be lowered by up to 2 M_sun/yr.\nFurthermore, the denser the surrounding gas, the more inter-stellar medium\n(ISM) is stripped. While at an ICM density of 10^-28 g/cm^3 about 30% of the\nISM is stripped, the galaxy is almost completely (more than 90%) stripped when\nan ICM density of 10^-27 g/cm^3 is applied. But again, a bulge prevents the\nstripping of the ISM and reduces the amount being stripped by up to 10%.\nThereby, fewer stars are formed in the wake if the galaxy contains a bulge. The\ndependence of the SFR on the disc tilt angle is not very pronounced. Hereby a\nslight trend of decreasing star formation with increasing inclination angle can\nbe determined. Furthermore, with increasing disc tilt angles, less gas is\nstripped and therefore fewer stars are formed in the wake. Reducing the disc\ngas mass fraction results in a lower SFR when the galaxies evolve in vacuum. On\nthe other hand, the enhancement of the SFR in case of acting ram pressure is\nless pronounced with increasing gas mass fraction. Moreover, the fractional\namount of stripped gas does not depend on the gas mass fraction.\n", "  The triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet (HAF) is known to carry\ntopological Z_2 vortex excitations which form a gas at finite temperatures.\nHere we show that the spin-orbit interaction, introduced via a Kitaev term in\nthe exchange Hamiltonian, condenses these vortices into a triangular $Z_2$\nvortex crystal at zero temperature. The cores of the Z_2 vortices show abrupt,\nsoliton-like magnetization modulations and arise by a special intertwining of\nthree honeycomb superstructures of ferromagnetic domains, one for each of the\nthree sublattices of the 120-degree state of the pure HAF. This is a new\nexample of a nucleation transition, analogous to the spontaneous formation of\nmagnetic domains, Abrikosov vortices in type-II syperconductors, blue phases in\ncholesteric liquid crystals, and skyrmions in chiral helimagnets. As the\nmechanism relies on the interplay of geometric frustration and spin-orbital\nanisotropies, such vortex mesophases can materialize as a ground-state property\nin spin-orbit coupled correlated systems with nearly hexagonal topology, as in\ntriangular or strongly frustrated honeycomb iridates.\n", "  Orbifolds of two-dimensional quantum field theories have a natural\nformulation in terms of defects or domain walls. This perspective allows for a\nrich generalisation of the orbifolding procedure, which we study in detail for\nthe case of topological field theories. Namely, a TFT with defects gives rise\nto a pivotal bicategory of \"worldsheet phases\" and defects between them. We\ndevelop a general framework which takes such a bicategory B as input and\nreturns its \"orbifold completion\" B_orb. The completion satisfies the natural\nproperties B \\subset B_orb and (B_orb)_orb = B_orb, and it gives rise to\nvarious new equivalences and nondegeneracy results. When applied to TFTs, the\nobjects in B_orb correspond to generalised orbifolds of the theories in B. In\nthe example of Landau-Ginzburg models we recover and unify conventional\nequivariant matrix factorisations, prove when and how (generalised) orbifolds\nagain produce open/closed TFTs, and give nontrivial examples of new orbifold\nequivalences.\n", "  We use mutual information as a measure of the entanglement between 'physical'\nand thermo-field double degrees of freedom in field theories at finite\ntemperature. We compute this \"thermo-mutual information\" in simple toy models:\na quantum mechanics two-site spin chain, a two dimensional massless fermion,\nand a two dimensional holographic system. In holographic systems, the\nthermo-mutual information is related to minimal surfaces connecting the two\ndisconnected boundaries of an eternal black hole. We derive a number of salient\nfeatures of this thermo-mutual information, including that it is UV finite,\npositive definite and bounded from above by the standard mutual information for\nthe thermal ensemble. We relate the construction of the reduced density\nmatrices used to define the thermo-mutual information to the Schwinger-Keldysh\nformalism, ensuring that all our objects are well defined in Euclidean and\nLorentzian signature.\n", "  Several planets have recently been discovered around old metal-poor stars,\nimplying that these planets are also old, formed in the early Universe. The\ncanonical theory suggests that the conditions for their formation could not\nhave existed at such early epochs. In this paper we argue that the required\nconditions, such as sufficiently high dust-to-gas ratio, could in fact have\nexisted in the early Universe immediately following the first episode of metal\nproduction in Pop. III stars, both in metal-enhanced and metal-deficient\nenvironments. Metal-rich regions may have existed in multiple isolated pockets\nof enriched and weakly-mixed gas close to the massive Pop. III stars.\nObservations of quasars at redshifts $z\\sim 5$, and gamma-ray bursts at $z\\sim\n6$, show a very wide spread of metals in absorption from $\\rm [X/H]\\simeq -3$\nto $\\simeq -0.5$. This suggests that physical conditions in the metal-abundant\nclumps could have been similar to where protoplanets form today. However,\nplanets could have formed even in low-metallicity environments, where formation\nof stars is expected to proceed due to lower opacity at higher densities. In\nsuch cases, the circumstellar accretion disks are expected to rotate faster\nthan their high-metallicity analogues. This can result in the enhancement of\ndust particles at the disk periphery, where they can coagulate and start\nforming planetesimals. In conditions with the low initial specific angular\nmomentum, radiation from the central protostar can act as a trigger to drive\ninstabilities with masses in the Earth to Jupiter mass range. Discoveries of\nplanets around old metal-poor stars (e.g. HIP 11952, $\\rm [Fe/H]\\sim -1.95$)\nshow that planets did indeed form in the early Universe and this may require\nmodification of our understanding of the physical processes that produce them.\nThis work is an attempt to provide a heuristic scenario for their existence.\n", "  In the initial conditions of the $3 + 1$ formalism for numerical relativity,\nthe transverse and trace-free (TT) part of the extrinsic curvature plays a key\nrole. We know that TT tensors possess two degrees of freedom per space point.\nHowever, finding an expression for a TT tensor depending on only two scalar\nfunctions is a non-trivial task. Assuming either axial or translational\nsymmetry, expressions depending on two scalar potentials alone are derived here\nfor \\emph{all} TT tensors in flat $3$-space. In a more general spatial slice,\nonly one of these potentials is found, the same potential given in\n\\cite{BakerPuzio} and \\cite{Dain}, with the remaining equations reduced to a\npartial differential equation, depending on boundary conditions for a solution.\nAs an exercise, we also derive the potentials which give the Bowen-York\ncurvature tensor in flat space.\n", "  In this paper a comparison between first order microscopic and macroscopic\ndifferential models of crowd dynamics is established for an increasing number\n$N$ of pedestrians. The novelty is the fact of considering massive agents,\nnamely particles whose individual mass does not become infinitesimal when $N$\ngrows. This implies that the total mass of the system is not constant but grows\nwith $N$. The main result is that the two types of models approach one another\nin the limit $N\\to\\infty$, provided the strength and/or the domain of\npedestrian interactions are properly modulated by $N$ at either scale. This is\nconsistent with the idea that pedestrians may adapt their interpersonal\nattitudes according to the overall level of congestion.\n", "  We investigate long-range effects of the dipolar interaction in Bose-Einstein\ncondensates by solving the time-dependent 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We\nstudy the propagation of excitations between non-overlapping condensates when a\ncollective mode is excited in one of the condensates. We obtain the frequency\nshifts due to the long-range character of the dipolar coupling for the bilayer\nand also the trilayer system when the dipolar mode is excited in one\ncondensate. The propagation of the monopolar and quadrupolar modes are also\ninvestigated. The coupled-pendulum model is proposed to qualitatively explain\nthe long range effects of the dipolar coupling.\n", "  Mesoscopic samples of polarized dipolar atoms confined in three spatially\nseparated traps conform an extended Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian in which different\nquantum phases appear depending on the competition between tunneling, on-site\nand long range inter-site dipole-dipole interactions. Here, by choosing an\nappropriate configuration of triple-wells, we analyze the role played by the\nanisotropic character inherent to the dipolar interaction in the phase diagram\nof the system. We further characterize the different phases as well as their\nboundaries by means of their entanglement properties.\n", "  The Lindemann criterion is reformulated in terms of the average shear modulus\n$G_c$ of the melting crystal, indicating a critical melting shear strain which\nis necessary to form the many different inherent states of the liquid. In glass\nformers with covalent bonds, one has to distinguish between soft and hard\ndegrees of freedom to reach agreement. The temperature dependence of the\npicosecond mean square displacements of liquid and crystal shows that there are\ntwo separate contributions to the divergence of the viscosity with decreasing\ntemperature: the anharmonic increase of the shear modulus and a diverging\ncorrelation length .\n", "  This paper is devoted to the study of the separability problem in the field\nof Quantum information theory. We deal mainly with the bipartite finite\ndimensional case and with two types of matrices, one of them being the PPT\nmatrices. We proved that many results holds for both types. If these matrices\nhave specific Hermitian Schmidt decompositions then the matrices are separable\nin a very strong sense. We proved that both types have what we call split\ndecompositions.\n  We defined the notion of weak irreducible matrix, based on the concept of\nirreducible state defined recently. These split decomposition theorems together\nwith the notion of weak irreducible matrix, imply that these matrices are weak\nirreducible or a sum of weak irreducible matrices of the same type. The\nseparability problem for these types of matrices can be reduced to the set of\nweak irreducible matrices of the same type. We also provided a complete\ndescription of weak irreducible matrices of both types.\n  Using the fact that every positive semidefinite Hermitian matrix with tensor\nrank 2 is separable, we found sharp inequalites providing separability for both\ntypes.\n", "  We give an example of a mathematical model describing quantum mechanical\nprocesses interacting with medium. As a model, we consider the process of heat\nscattering of a wave function defined on the phase space. We consider the case\nwhen the heat diffusion takes place only with respect to momenta. We state and\nstudy the corresponding modified Kramers equation for this process. We consider\nthe consequent approximations to this equation in powers of the quantity\ninverse to the medium resistance per unit of mass of the particle in the\nprocess. The approximations are constructed similarly to statistical physics,\nwhere from the usual Kramers equation for the evolution of probability density\nof the Brownian motion of a particle in the phase space, one deduces an\napproximate description of this process by the Fokker--Planck equation for the\ndensity of probability distribution in the configuration space. We prove that\nthe zero (invertible) approximation to our model with respect to the large\nparameter of the medium resistance, yields the usual quantum mechanical\ndescription by the Schr\\\"odinger equation with the standard Hamilton operator.\nWe deduce the next approximation to the model with respect to the negative\npower of the medium resistance coefficient. As a result we obtain the modified\nSchr\\\"odinger equation taking into account dissipation of the process in the\ninitial model.\n", "  By analyzing the first-order interference of two independent thermal light\nbeams with both classical and quantum theories, we conclude that it is\nimpossible to observe the transient first-order interference pattern by\nsuperposing two independent thermal light beams even if the degeneracy\nparameter of thermal light is much greater than one. The result suggests that\nthe classical model of thermal light field within the coherence time may not be\nthe same as the one of laser light field within the coherence time.\n", "  Some simple structure of maximally four-qubit state is presented. Using\nstochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) invariants, it\nis can be shown those simple structure of maximally four-qubit state is SLOCC\nequivalent to four-qubit \\c{hi} state.\n", "  Cooperative behavior lies at the very basis of human societies, yet its\nevolutionary origin remains a key unsolved puzzle. Whereas reciprocity or\nconditional cooperation is one of the most prominent mechanisms proposed to\nexplain the emergence of cooperation in social dilemmas, recent experimental\nfindings on networked Prisoner's Dilemma games suggest that conditional\ncooperation also depends on the previous action of the player---namely on the\n`mood' in which the player currently is. Roughly, a majority of people behaves\nas conditional cooperators if they cooperated in the past, while they ignore\nthe context and free-ride with high probability if they did not. However, the\nultimate origin of this behavior represents a conundrum itself. Here we aim\nspecifically at providing an evolutionary explanation of moody conditional\ncooperation. To this end, we perform an extensive analysis of different\nevolutionary dynamics for players' behavioral traits---ranging from standard\nprocesses used in game theory based on payoff comparison to others that include\nnon-economic or social factors. Our results show that only a dynamic built upon\nreinforcement learning is able to give rise to evolutionarily stable moody\nconditional cooperation, and at the end to reproduce the human behaviors\nobserved in the experiments.\n", "  Making use of the classical second moment sum rule, it is possible to convert\na series of constant-Q x-ray Brillouin scattering scans (Q momentum transfer)\ninto a series of constant frequency scans over the measured $Q$ range. The\nmethod is applied to literature results for the phonon dispersion in liquid\nvitreous silica and in glassy polybutadiene. It turns out that the constant\nfrequency scans are again well fitted by the damped harmonic oscillator\nfunction, but now in terms of a Q-independent phonon damping depending\nexclusively on the frequency. At low frequency, the sound velocity and the\ndamping of both evaluations agree, but at higher frequencies one gets\nsignificant differences. The results in silica suggest a new interpretation of\nx-ray Brillouin data in terms of a strong mixing of longitudinal and transverse\nphonons toward higher frequencies. The results in polybutadiene enlighten the\ncrossover from Brillouin to Umklapp scattering.\n", "  Nonlinear optical cavities are crucial both in classical and quantum optics;\nin particular, nowadays optical parametric oscillators are one of the most\nversatile and tunable sources of coherent light, as well as the sources of the\nhighest quality quantum-correlated light in the continuous variable regime.\nBeing nonlinear systems, they can be driven through critical points in which a\nsolution ceases to exist in favour of a new one, and it is close to these\npoints where quantum correlations are the strongest. The simplest description\nof such systems consists in writing the quantum fields as the classical part\nplus some quantum fluctuations, linearizing then the dynamical equations with\nrespect to the latter; however, such an approach breaks down close to critical\npoints, where it provides unphysical predictions such as infinite photon\nnumbers. On the other hand, techniques going beyond the simple linear\ndescription become too complicated especially regarding the evaluation of\ntwo-time correlators, which are of major importance to compute observables\noutside the cavity. In this article we provide a regularized linear description\nof nonlinear cavities, that is, a linearization procedure yielding physical\nresults, taking the degenerate optical parametric oscillator as the guiding\nexample. The method, which we call self-consistent linearization, is shown to\nbe equivalent to a general Gaussian ansatz for the state of the system, and we\ncompare its predictions with those obtained with available exact (or\nquasi-exact) methods.\n", "  In order to better understand how AdS holography works for sub-regions, we\nformulate a holographic version of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem for the simple\ncase of an AdS Klein-Gordon field. This theorem asserts that the set of states\nconstructed by acting on a suitable vacuum state with boundary observables\ncontained within any subset of the boundary is dense in the Hilbert space of\nthe bulk theory. To prove this theorem we need two ingredients which are\nthemselves of interest. First, we prove a purely bulk version of Reeh-Schlieder\ntheorem for an AdS Klein-Gordon field. This theorem relies on the analyticity\nproperties of certain vacuum states. Our second ingredient is a\nboundary-to-bulk map for local observables on an AdS causal wedge. This mapping\nis achieved by simple integral kernels which construct bulk observables from\nconvolutions with boundary operators. Our analysis improves on previous\nconstructions of AdS boundary-to-bulk maps in that it is formulated entirely in\nLorentz signature without the need for large analytic continuation of spatial\ncoordinates. Both our Reeh-Schlieder theorem and boundary-to-bulk maps may be\napplied to globally well-defined states constructed from the usual AdS vacuum\nas well more singular states such as the local vacuum of an AdS causal wedge\nwhich is singular on the horizon.\n", "  We derive a strengthened monotonicity inequality for quantum relative entropy\nby employing properties of $\\alpha$-R\\'{e}nyi relative entropy. We develop a\nunifying treatment towards the improvement of some quantum entropy\ninequalities. In particular, an emphasis is put on a lower bound of quantum\nconditional mutual information (QCMI) as it gives a Pinsker-like lower bound\nfor the QCMI. We also give some improved entropy inequalities based on\nR\\'{e}nyi relative entropy. The inequalities obtained, thus, extends some\nwell-known ones. We also obtain a condition under which a tripartite operator\nbecomes a Markov state. As a by-product we provide some trace inequalities of\noperators, which are of independent interest.\n", "  The Pluto-Charon system, likely formed from an impact, has reached the\nendpoint of its tidal evolution. During its evolution into the dual-synchronous\nstate, the equilibrium tidal figures of Pluto and Charon would have also\nevolved as angular momentum was transferred from Pluto's spin to Charon's\norbit. The rate of tidal evolution is controlled by Pluto's interior physical\nand thermal state. We examine three interior models for Pluto: an\nundifferentiated rock/ice mixture, differentiated with ice above rock, and\ndifferentiated with an ocean. For the undifferentiated case without an ocean,\nthe Pluto-Charon binary does not evolve to its current state unless its\ninternal temperature $T_i>200$ K, which would likely lead to strong tidal\nheating, melting, and differentiation. Without an ocean, Pluto's interior\ntemperature must be higher than 240 K for Charon to evolve on a time scale less\nthan the age of the solar system. Further tidal heating would likely create an\nocean. If New Horizons finds evidence of ancient tidally-driven tectonic\nactivity on either body, the most likely explanation is that Pluto had an\ninternal ocean during Charon's orbital evolution.\n", "  Saturn's moon Iapetus has an equatorial ridge system, which may be as high as\n20 km, that may have formed by endogenic forces, such as tectonic and\nconvective forces, or exogenic processes such as debris infall. We use\nhigh-resolution topographic data to conduct a topographic analysis of the\nridge, which suggests a predominantly triangular morphology, with some ridge\nface slopes reaching 40 degrees, allowing for an exogenic formation mechanism.\n", "  A variable speed of light (VSL) cosmology is described in which the causal\nmechanism of generating primordial perturbations is achieved by varying the\nspeed of light in a primordial epoch. This yields an alternative to inflation\nfor explaining the formation of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the\nlarge scale structure (LSS) of the universe. The initial value horizon and\nflatness problems in cosmology are solved. The model predicts primordial scalar\nand tensor fluctuation spectral indices $n_s=0.96$ and $n_t=- 0.04$,\nrespectively. We make use of the $\\delta{\\cal N}$ formalism to identify\nsignatures of primordial nonlinear fluctuations, and this allows the VSL model\nto be distinguished from inflationary models. In particular, we find that the\nparameter $f_{\\rm NL}=5$ in the variable speed of light cosmology. The value of\nthe parameter $g_{\\rm NL}$ evolves during the primordial era and shows a\nrunning behavior.\n", "  Classical lumped components delay lines are built with inductances and\ncapacitors arranged as to match the standard telegraphist line model to obtain\nslow group velocity lines. In this paper we demonstrate that a practical way to\nobtain significant group velocity reduction consist in taking advantage of the\nforbidden bands that present a 1D meta-material. The feasibility of this kind\nof line, as well as its ability to transmit data are discussed and practically\nverified.\n", "  It is believed by the majority today that the efficient market hypothesis is\nimperfect because of market irrationality. Using the physical concepts and\nmathematical structures of quantum mechanics, we construct an econophysics\nframework for the stock market, based on which we analogously map massive\nnumbers of single stocks into a reservoir consisting of many quantum harmonic\noscillators and their stock index into a typical quantum open system--a quantum\nBrownian particle. In particular, the irrationality of stock transactions is\nquantitatively considered as the Planck constant within Heisenberg's\nuncertainty relationship of quantum mechanics in an analogous manner. We\nanalyze real stock data of Shanghai Stock Exchange of China and investigate\nfat-tail phenomena and non-Markovian behaviors of the stock index with the\nassistance of the quantum Brownian motion model, thereby interpreting and\nstudying the limitations of the classical Brownian motion model for the\nefficient market hypothesis from a new perspective of quantum open system\ndynamics.\n", "  Recently, in [1], the author proved that many results that are true for PPT\nmatrices also hold for another class of matrices with a certain symmetry in\ntheir Hermitian Schmidt decompositions. These matrices were called SPC in [1]\n(definition 1.1). Before that, in [9], T\\'oth and G\\\"uhne proved that if a\nstate is symmetric then it is PPT if and only if it is SPC. A natural question\nappeared: What is the connection between SPC matrices and PPT matrices? Is\nevery SPC matrix PPT?\n  Here we show that every SPC matrix is PPT in $M_2\\otimes M_2$ (theorem 4.3).\nThis theorem is a consequence of the fact that every density matrix in\n$M_2\\otimes M_m$, with tensor rank smaller or equal to 3, is separable (theorem\n3.2). This theorem is a generalization of the same result found in [1] for\ntensor rank 2 matrices in $M_k\\otimes M_m$. Although, in $M_3\\otimes M_3$,\nthere exists a SPC matrix with tensor rank 3 that is not PPT (proposition 5.2).\nWe shall also provide a non trivial example of a family of matrices in\n$M_k\\otimes M_k$, in which both, the SPC and PPT properties, are equivalent\n(proposition 6.2). Within this family, there exists a non trivial subfamily in\nwhich the SPC property is equivalent to separability (proposition 6.4).\n", "  We study some claims in Krauss' recent book, \\emph{A Universe from Nothing:\nWhy there is something rather than nothing}, that are employed to show that a\nuniverse can come from \"nothing\". In this brief paper, we show that many of the\nclaims are not supported in full by modern general relativity theory or quantum\nfield theory in curved spacetime.\n", "  Ridge-and-trough terrain is a common landform on outer Solar System icy\nsatellites. Examples include Ganymede's grooved terrain, Europa's gray bands,\nMiranda's coronae, and several terrains on Enceladus. The conditions associated\nwith the formation of each of these terrains are similar: heat flows of order\ntens to a hundred milliwatts per meter squared, and deformation rates of order\n$10^{-16}$ to $10^{-12}$ s$^{-1}$. Our prior work shows that the conditions\nassociated with the formation of these terrains on Ganymede and the south pole\nof Enceladus are consistent with vigorous solid-state ice convection in a shell\nwith a weak surface. We show that sluggish lid convection, an intermediate\nregime between the isoviscous and stagnant lid regimes, can create the heat\nflow and deformation rates appropriate for ridge and trough formation on a\nnumber of satellites, regardless of the ice shell thickness. For convection to\ndeform their surfaces, the ice shells must have yield stresses similar in\nmagnitude to the daily tidal stresses. Tidal and convective stresses deform the\nsurface, and the spatial pattern of tidal cracking controls the locations of\nridge-and-trough terrain.\n", "  In this manuscript we propose a mathematical framework to couple\ntranscription and translation in which mRNA production is described by a set of\nmaster equations while the dynamics of protein density is governed by a random\ndifferential equation. The coupling between the two processes is given by a\nstochastic perturbation whose statistics satisfies the master equations. In\nthis approach, from the knowledge of the analytical time dependent distribution\nof mRNA number, we are able to calculate the dynamics of the probability\ndensity of the protein population.\n", "  We describe some of the important physical characteristics of the `pathways',\ni.e. dynamical processes, by which molecular, nanoscale and micron-scale\nself-assembly occurs. We highlight the fact that there exist features of\nself-assembly pathways that are common to a wide range of physical systems,\neven though those systems may be different in respect of their microscopic\ndetails. We summarize some existing theoretical descriptions of self-assembly\npathways, and highlight areas -- notably, the description of self-assembly\npathways that occur `far' from equilibrium -- that are likely to become\nincreasingly important.\n", "  The superposition principle is at the heart of quantum mechanics and at the\nroot of many paradoxes arising when trying to extend its predictions to our\neveryday world. Schroedinger's cat is the prototype of such paradoxes and here,\nin contrast to many others, we choose to investigate it from the operational\npoint of view. We experimentally demonstrate a universal strategy for producing\nan unambiguously distinguishable type of superposition, that of an arbitrary\npure state and its orthogonal. It relies on only a limited amount of\ninformation about the input state to first generate its orthogonal one. Then, a\nsimple change in the experimental parameters is used to produce arbitrary\nsuperpositions of the mutually orthogonal states. Constituting a sort of\nSchroedinger's black box, able to turn a whole zoo of input states into\ncoherent superpositions, our scheme can produce arbitrary continuous-variable\noptical qubits, which may prove practical for implementing quantum technologies\nand measurement tasks.\n", "  A pure-loss bosonic channel is a simple model for communication over\nfree-space or fiber-optic links. More generally, phase-insensitive bosonic\nchannels model other kinds of noise, such as thermalizing or amplifying\nprocesses. Recent work has established the classical capacity of all of these\nchannels, and furthermore, it is now known that a strong converse theorem holds\nfor the classical capacity of these channels under a particular photon number\nconstraint. The goal of the present paper is to initiate the study of\nsecond-order coding rates for these channels, by beginning with the simplest\none, the pure-loss bosonic channel. In a second-order analysis of\ncommunication, one fixes the tolerable error probability and seeks to\nunderstand the back-off from capacity for a sufficiently large yet finite\nnumber of channel uses. We find a lower bound on the maximum achievable code\nsize for the pure-loss bosonic channel, in terms of the known expression for\nits capacity and a quantity called channel dispersion. We accomplish this by\nproving a general \"one-shot\" coding theorem for channels with classical inputs\nand pure-state quantum outputs which reside in a separable Hilbert space. The\ntheorem leads to an optimal second-order characterization when the channel\noutput is finite-dimensional, and it remains an open question to determine\nwhether the characterization is optimal for the pure-loss bosonic channel.\n", "  It has been recently shown that one can understand the Prigogine-Defay ratio\nat the glass transition in terms of freezing into one of the many inherent\nstates of the undercooled liquid. In the present paper, the treatment is\nextended to the dynamics at the glass transition to show the connection to\nisomorphism and density scaling. In addition, the energy limits for stable\ninherent states are discussed.\n", "  Ultrasound-modulated optical tomography is an emerging biomedical imaging\nmodality which uses the spatially localised acoustically-driven modulation of\ncoherent light as a probe of the structure and optical properties of biological\ntissues. In this work we begin by providing an overview of forward modelling\nmethods, before deriving a linearised diffusion-style model which calculates\nthe first-harmonic modulated flux measured on the boundary of a given domain.\nWe derive and examine the correlation measurement density functions of the\nmodel which describe the sensitivity of the modality to perturbations in the\noptical parameters of interest. Finally, we employ said functions in the\ndevelopment of an adjoint-assisted gradient based image reconstruction method,\nwhich ameliorates the computational burden and memory requirements of a\ntraditional Newton-based optimisation approach. We validate our work by\nperforming reconstructions of optical absorption and scattering in two- and\nthree-dimensions using simulated measurements with 1% proportional Gaussian\nnoise, and demonstrate the successful recovery of the parameters to within\n+/-5% of their true values when the resolution of the ultrasound raster probing\nthe domain is sufficient to delineate perturbing inclusions.\n", "  The drag and diffusion coefficients of a hot hadronic medium have been\nevaluated by using hidden charm mesons as probes. The matrix elements for the\nevaluation of these coefficients are calculated using an effective theory as\nwell as from scattering lengths. Although the transport coefficients show a\nsignificant rise with temperature its effects on the suppression of $J/\\psi$ in\nhadronic matter is not significant.\n", "  In this paper, a multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann (LB) model\nis developed for simulating incompressible axisymmetric thermal flows in porous\nmedia at the representative elementary volume (REV) scale. In the model, a D2Q9\nMRT-LB equation is proposed to solve the flow field in addition to the D2Q5 LB\nequation for the temperature field. The source terms of the model are simple\nand contain no velocity and temperature gradient terms. The generalized\naxisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations for axisymmetric flows in porous media are\ncorrectly recovered from the MRT-LB model through the Chapman-Enskog analysis\nin the moment space. The present model is validated by numerical simulations of\nseveral typical axisymmetric thermal problems in porous media. The numerical\nresults agree well with the data reported in the literature, demonstrating the\neffectiveness and accuracy of the present MRT-LB model for simulating\naxisymmetric thermal flows in porous media.\n", "  We provide a new approach to study the noncommutative effects on the neutral\nDirac particle with anomalous magnetic or electric dipole moment on the\nnoncommutative plane. The advantages of this approach are demonstrated by\ninvestigating the noncommutative corrections on the Aharonov-Casher and\nHe-McKellar-Wilkens effects. This approach is based on the effective $U(1)$\ngauge symmetry for the electrodynamics of spin on the two dimensional space.\nThe Seiberg-Witten map for this symmetry is then employed when we study the\nnoncommutative corrections. Because the Seiberg-Witten map preserves the gauge\nsymmetry, the noncommutative corrections can be defined consistently with the\nordinary phases. Based on this approach we find the noncommutative corrections\non the Aharonov-Casher and He-McKellar-Wilkens phases consist of two terms. The\nfirst one depends on the beam particle velocity and consistence with the\nprevious results. However the second term is velocity-independent and then\ncompletely new. Therefore our results indicate it is possible to investigate\nthe noncommutative space by using ultra-cold neutron interferometer in which\nthe velocity-dependent term is negligible. Furthermore, both these two terms\nare proportional to the ratio between the noncommutative parameter $\\theta$ and\nthe cross section $A_{e/m}$ of the electrical/magnetic charged line enclosed by\nthe trajectory of beam particles. Therefore the experimental sensitivity can be\nsignificantly enhanced by reduce the cross section of the charge line\n$A_{e/m}$.\n", "  Using dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) we study a simplified model for\nheterostructures involving superconductors. The system is driven\nout-of-equilibrium by a voltage bias, imposed as an imbalance of chemical\npotential at the interface. We solve the self-consistent DMFT equations using\niterative second-order perturbation theory in the Nambu-Keldysh formalism. We\nshow that the superconducting state is destabilized by voltage biases of the\norder of the energy gap. We demonstrate that the transition to the normal state\noccurs through an intermediate bad superconducting state, which is\ncharacterized by a smaller value of the order parameter and incoherent\nexcitations. We discuss the energetic balance behind the stabilization of such\nexotic superconducting state.\n", "  We theoretically investigate a weakly-interacting degenerate Bose gas coupled\nto an empty Markovian bath. We show that in the universal phononic limit the\nsystem evolves towards an asymptotic state where an emergent temperature is set\nby the quantum noise of the outcoupling process. For situations typically\nencountered in experiments, this mechanism leads to significant cooling. Such\ndissipative cooling supplements conventional evaporative cooling and dominates\nin settings where thermalization is highly suppressed, such as in a\none-dimensional quasicondensate.\n", "  We report on the results of a search for radio transients between 115 and\n190\\,MHz with the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR). Four fields have been monitored\nwith cadences between 15 minutes and several months. A total of 151 images were\nobtained, giving a total survey area of 2275 deg$^2$. We analysed our data\nusing standard LOFAR tools and searched for radio transients using the LOFAR\nTransients Pipeline (TraP). No credible radio transient candidate has been\ndetected; however, we are able to set upper limits on the surface density of\nradio transient sources at low radio frequencies. We also show that\nlow-frequency radio surveys are more sensitive to steep-spectrum coherent\ntransient sources than GHz radio surveys. We used two new statistical methods\nto determine the upper limits on the transient surface density. One is free of\nassumptions on the flux distribution of the sources, while the other assumes a\npower-law distribution in flux and sets more stringent constraints on the\ntransient surface density. Both of these methods provide better constraints\nthan the approach used in previous works. The best value for the upper limit we\ncan set for the transient surface density, using the method assuming a\npower-law flux distribution, is 1.3$\\cdot$10$^{-3}$ deg$^{-2}$ for transients\nbrighter than 0.3 Jy with a time-scale of 15 min, at a frequency of 150 MHz. We\nalso calculated for the first time upper limits for the transient surface\ndensity for transients of different time-scales. We find that the results can\ndiffer by orders of magnitude from previously reported, simplified estimates.\n", "  We derive an asymptotic expansion for the Weyl function of a one-dimensional\nSchr\\\"odinger operator which generalizes the classical formula by Atkinson.\nMoreover, we show that the asymptotic formula can also be interpreted in the\nsense of distributions.\n", "  Single-photon states, which carry quantum information and coherently interact\nwith quantum systems, are vital to the realization of all-optical engineered\nquantum networks. In this paper we derive the analytical form of the output\nfield state for a large class of quantum finite-level systems driven by\nsingle-photon input field states using a transfer function approach.\nSingle-photon pulse shaping via coherent feedback is also studied.\n", "  Over the past few years, there has been a hint of the $\\gamma$-ray excess\nobserved by the Fermi-LAT satellite borne telescope from the regions\nsurrounding the Galactic Centre at an energy range $\\sim 1$-$3$ GeV. The nature\nof this excess $\\gamma$-ray spectrum is found to be consistent with the\n$\\gamma$-ray emission expected from dark matter annihilation at the Galactic\nCentre while disfavouring other known astrophysical sources as the possible\norigin of this phenomena. It is also reported that the spectrum and morphology\nof this excess $\\gamma$-rays can well be explained by the dark matter particles\nhaving mass in the range $30\\sim 40$ GeV annihilating significantly into ${\\rm\nb} \\bar{\\rm b}$ final state with an annihilation cross section $\\sigma {\\rm\nv}\\sim (1.4$ - $2.0)\\times 10^{-26}$ cm$^3/$s at the Galactic Centre. In this\nwork, we propose a two component dark matter model where two different types of\ndark matter particles namely a complex scalar and a Dirac fermion are\nconsidered. The stability of both the dark sector particles are maintained by\nvirtue of an additional local U$(1)_{\\rm X}$ gauge symmetry. We find that our\nproposed scenario can provide a viable explanation for this anomalous excess\n$\\gamma$-rays besides satisfying all the existing relevant theoretical as well\nas experimental and observational bounds from LHC, PLANCK and LUX\ncollaborations. The allowed range of \"effective annihilation cross section\" of\nlighter dark matter particle for the ${\\rm b} \\bar{\\rm b}$ annihilation channel\nthus obtained, is finally compared with the limits reported by the Fermi-LAT\nand DES collaborations using data from various dwarf spheroidal galaxies.\n", "  The self-assembly of molecules at surfaces can be caused by a range of\nphysical mechanisms. Assembly can be driven by intermolecular forces, or\nmolecule-surface forces, or both; it can result in structures that are in\nequilibrium or that are kinetically trapped. Here we review examples of\nself-assembly at surfaces that have been studied within the User program of the\nMolecular Foundry at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, focusing on a\nphysical understanding of what causes patterns seen in experiment. Some\napparently disparate systems can be described in similar physical terms,\nindicating that simple factors -- such as the geometry and energy scale of\nintermolecular binding -- are key to understanding the self-assembly of those\nsystems.\n", "  Recent advances in the development of modern quantum technologies have opened\nthe possibility of studying the interplay between spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion and optomechanics, two of the most fundamental nonlinear\noptical processes. Apart from practical reasons, such scenario is very\ninteresting from a fundamental point of view, because it allows exploring the\noptomechanical interaction in the presence of a strongly quantum-correlated\nfield, the spontaneously down-converted mode. In this work we analyze such\nproblem from two approximate but valuable perspectives: the classical limit and\nthe limit of small quantum fluctuations. We show that, in the presence of\noptomechanical coupling, the well-known classical phase diagram of the optical\nproblem gets modified by the appearance of new dynamical instabilities. As for\nthe quantum-mechanical description, we prove the ability of the squeezed\ndown-converted field to cool down the mechanical motion not only to thermal but\nalso to squeezed thermal mechanical states, and in a way that can be much less\nsensitive to parameters (e.g., detuning of the driving laser) than standard\nsideband cooling.\n", "  We study the Josephson coupling of superconducting (SC) islands through the\nsurface of single-layer (SLG) and bilayer (BLG) graphene, as a function of\ndistance between the grains, temperature, chemical potential and external\n(transverse) gate-voltage. For SLG, we provide a comparison with existing\nliterature. The proximity effect is analyzed through a Matsubara Green function\napproach. This represents the first step in a discussion of the conditions for\nthe onset of a granular superconductivity within the film, made possible by\nJosephson currents flowing between superconductors. To ensure phase coherence\nover the 2D sample, a random spatial distribution can be assumed for the SC\nislands on the SLG sheet (or intercalating the BLG sheets). The tunable\ngate-voltage-induced band gap of BLG affects the asymptotic decay of the\nJosephson coupling-distance characteristic for each pair of SC islands in the\nsample, which results in the end in a qualitatively strong field-dependence of\nthe relation between Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition critical\ntemperature and gate-voltage.\n", "  We give an efficient quantum algorithm for the Moebius function $\\mu(n)$ from\nthe natural numbers to $\\{-1,0,1\\}$. The cost of the algorithm is\nasymptotically quadratic in $\\log n$ and does not require the computation of\nthe prime factorization of $n$ as an intermediate step.\n", "  A hierarchy of mathematical models describing viscosity-stratified flow in a\nHele-Shaw cell is constructed. Numerical modelling of jet flow and development\nof viscous fingers with the influence of inertia and friction is carried out.\nOne-dimensional multi-layer flows are studied. In the framework of three-layer\nflow the interpretation of the Saffman--Taylor instability is given. A\nkinematic-wave model of viscous fingering taking into account friction between\nthe fluid layers is proposed. Comparison with calculations on the basis of\ntwo-dimensional equations shows that this model allows to determine the\nvelocity of propagation and the thickness of the viscous fingers.\n", "  We construct three-qubit entanglement witnesses with the properties that all\nthe partial transposes have the spanning properties. These witnesses determine\nfaces for separable states whose interior lies in the interior of PPT states,\nand so they detect sets of PPT entangled states with nonempty interiors. These\nwitnesses also detect all kinds of bi-separable pure product states. Our\nconstruction depends on the observation that multi-partite entanglement\nwitnesses correspond to multi-linear maps which are positive.\n", "  We explore the possibility of measuring the mass accretion rate (MAR) of\ngalaxy clusters from their mass profiles beyond the virial radius $R_{200}$. We\nderive the accretion rate from the mass of a spherical shell whose inner radius\nis $2R_{200}$, whose thickness changes with redshift, and whose infall velocity\nis assumed to be equal to the mean infall velocity of the spherical shells of\ndark matter halos extracted from $N$-body simulations. This approximation is\nrather crude in hierarchical clustering scenarios where both smooth accretion\nand aggregation of smaller dark matter halos contribute to the mass accretion\nof clusters.Nevertheless, in the redshift range $z=[0,2]$, our prescription\nreturns an average MAR within $20-40 \\%$ of the average rate derived from the\nmerger trees of dark matter halos extracted from $N$-body simulations. The MAR\nof galaxy clusters has been the topic of numerous detailed numerical and\ntheoretical investigations, but so far it has remained inaccessible to\nmeasurements in the real universe. Since the measurement of the mass profile of\nclusters beyond their virial radius can be performed with the caustic technique\napplied to dense redshift surveys of the cluster outer regions, our result\nsuggests that measuring the mean MAR of a sample of galaxy clusters is actually\nfeasible. We thus provide a new potential observational test of the\ncosmological and structure formation models.\n", "  It has been recently claimed that the initial singularity might be avoided in\nthe context of rainbow cosmology, where one attempts to account for\nquantum-gravitational corrections through an effective-theory description based\non an energy-dependent (\"rainbow\") space-time metric. We here scrutinize this\nexciting hypothesis much more in depth than previous analyses. In particular,\nwe take into account all requirements for singularity avoidance, while\npreviously only a subset of these requirements had been considered. Moreover,\nwe show that the implications of a rainbow metric for thermodynamics are more\nsignificant than previously appreciated. Through the analysis of two\nparticularly meaningful examples of rainbow metrics we find that our concerns\nare not merely important conceptually, but actually change in quantitatively\nsignificant manner the outcome of the analysis. Notably we only find examples\nwhere the singularity is not avoided, though one can have that in the regime\nwhere our semi-classical picture is still reliable the approach to the\nsingularity is slowed down when compared to the standard classical scenario. We\nconclude that the study of rainbow metrics provides tantalizing hints of\nsingularity avoidance but is inconclusive, since some key questions remain to\nbe addressed just when the scale factor is very small, a regime which, as here\nargued, cannot be reliably described by an effective rainbow-metric picture.\n", "  We study the interplay between rotating wave approximation and optimal\ncontrol. In particular, we show that for a wide class of optimal control\nproblems one can choose the control field such that the Hamiltonian becomes\ntime-independent under the rotating wave approximation. Thus, we show how to\nrecast the functional minimization defined by the optimal control problem into\na simpler multi-variable function minimization. We provide the analytic\nsolution to the state-to-state transfer of the paradigmatic two-level system\nand to the more general star configuration of an $N$-level system. We\ndemonstrate numerically the usefulness of this approach in the more general\nclass of connected acyclic $N$-level systems with random spectra. Finally, we\nuse it to design a protocol to entangle Rydberg via constant laser pulses atoms\nin an experimentally relevant range of parameters.\n", "  The integrated mean curvature of a simplicial manifold is well understood in\nboth Regge Calculus and Discrete Differential Geometry. However, a well\nmotivated pointwise definition of curvature requires a careful choice of volume\nover which to uniformly distribute the local integrated curvature. We show that\nhybrid cells formed using both the simplicial lattice and its circumcentric\ndual emerge as a remarkably natural structure for the distribution of this\nlocal integrated curvature. These hybrid cells form a complete tessellation of\nthe simplicial manifold, contain a geometric orthonormal basis, and are also\nshown to give a pointwise mean curvature with a natural interpretation as a\nfractional rate of change of the normal vector.\n", "  The transverse and trace-free (TT) part of the extrinsic curvature represents\nhalf of the dynamical degrees of freedom of the gravitational field in the $3 +\n1$ formalism. As such, it is part of the freely specifiable initial data for\nnumerical relativity. Though TT tensors in 3-space possess only two component\ndegrees of freedom, they cannot ordinarily be given solely by two scalar\npotentials. Such expressions have been derived however, in coordinate form, for\nall TT tensors in flat space which are also translationally or axially\nsymmetric (Conboye and \\'O Murchadha 2014 \\emph{Class. Quantum Grav.} {\\bf 31}\n085019). Since TT tensors are conformally covariant, these also give TT tensors\nin conformally-flat space. In this article, the work above has been extended by\ngiving a coordinate-\\emph{independent} expression for these TT tensors. The\ntranslational and axial symmetry conditions have also been generalized to\ninvariance along any hypersurface orthogonal Killing vector.\n", "  In this article we review the astrophysical application of gravitational\nmicrolensing. After introducing the history of gravitational lensing, we\npresent the key equations and concept of microlensing. The most frequent\nmicrolensing events are single-lens events and historically it has been used\nfor searching dark matter in the form of compact astrophysical halo objects in\nthe Galactic halo. We discuss about the degeneracy problem in the parameters of\nlens and perturbation effects that can partially break the degeneracy between\nthe lens parameters. The rest of paper is about the astrophysical applications\nof microlensing. One of the important applications is in the stellar physics by\nprobing the surface of source stars in the high magnification microlensing\nevents. The astrometric and polarimetric observations will be complimentary for\nprobing the atmosphere and stellar spots on the surface of source stars.\nFinally we discuss about the future projects as space based telescopes for\nparallax and astrometry observations of microlensing events. With this project,\nwe would expect to produce a complete stellar and remnant mass function and\nstudy the structure of Galaxy in term of distribution of stars along our line\nof sight towards the centre of galaxy.\n", "  In this work we present a search for (solar) chameleons with the CERN Axion\nSolar Telescope (CAST). This novel experimental technique, in the field of dark\nenergy research, exploits both the chameleon coupling to matter ($\\beta_{\\rm\nm}$) and to photons ($\\beta_{\\gamma}$) via the Primakoff effect. By reducing\nthe X-ray detection energy threshold used for axions from 1$\\,$keV to 400$\\,$eV\nCAST became sensitive to the converted solar chameleon spectrum which peaks\naround 600$\\,$eV. Even though we have not observed any excess above background,\nwe can provide a 95% C.L. limit for the coupling strength of chameleons to\nphotons of $\\beta_{\\gamma}\\!\\lesssim\\!10^{11}$ for $1<\\beta_{\\rm m}<10^6$.\n", "  We generalize the technique of fringe-rate filtering, whereby visibilities\nmeasured by a radio interferometer are re-weighted according to their temporal\nvariation. As the Earth rotates, radio sources traverse through an\ninterferometer's fringe pattern at rates that depend on their position on the\nsky. Capitalizing on this geometric interpretation of fringe rates, we employ\ntime-domain convolution kernels to enact fringe-rate filters that sculpt the\neffective primary beam of antennas in an interferometer. As we show, beam\nsculpting through fringe-rate filtering can be used to optimize measurements\nfor a variety of applications, including mapmaking, minimizing polarization\nleakage, suppressing instrumental systematics, and enhancing the sensitivity of\npower-spectrum measurements. We show that fringe-rate filtering arises\nnaturally in minimum variance treatments of many of these problems, enabling\noptimal visibility-based approaches to analyses of interferometric data that\navoid systematics potentially introduced by traditional approaches such as\nimaging. Our techniques have recently been demonstrated in Ali et al. (2015),\nwhere new upper limits were placed on the 21 cm power spectrum from\nreionization, showcasing the ability of fringe-rate filtering to successfully\nboost sensitivity and reduce the impact of systematics in deep observations.\n", "  We consider bi-linear analogues of $s$-positivity for linear maps. The dual\nobjects of these notions can be described in terms of Schimdt ranks for\ntri-tensor products and Schmidt numbers for tri-partite quantum states. These\ntri-partite versions of Schmidt numbers cover various kinds of bi-separability,\nand so we may interpret witnesses for those in terms of bi-linear maps. We give\nconcrete examples of witnesses for various kinds of three qubit entanglement.\n", "  Today it is widely believed that $s$-channel excitation of an on-shell~$W$\nboson, commonly known as the Glashow resonance, can be initiated in matter only\nby the electron antineutrino in the process $\\bar\\nu_ee^-\\rightarrow W^-$ at\nthe laboratory energy around~6.3~PeV. In this paper we argue that the Glashow\nresonance within the Standard Model also occurs in neutrino--nucleus\ncollisions. The main conclusions are as follows. 1)~The Glashow resonance can\nbe excited by both~neutrinos and~antineutrinos of all the three flavors\nscattering in the Coulomb field of a nucleus. 2)~The Glashow resonance in a\nneutrino--nucleus reaction does not manifest itself as a Breit--Wigner-like\npeak in the cross section but the latter exhibits instead a slow\nlogarithmic-law growth with the neutrino energy. The resonance turns thus out\nto be hidden. 3)~More than~$98\\%$ of~$W$ bosons produced in the sub-PeV region\nin neutrino-initiated reactions in water/ice will be from the Glashow\nresonance. 4)~The vast majority of the Glashow resonance events in a neutrino\ndetector is expected at energies from a few TeV to a few tens of TeV, being\nmostly initiated by the conventional atmospheric neutrinos dominant in this\nenergy range. Calculations of the cross sections for Glashow resonance\nexcitation on the oxygen nucleus as well as on the proton are carried out in\ndetail. The results of this paper can be useful for studies of neutrino\ninteractions at large volume water/ice neutrino detectors. For example, in the\nIceCube detector one can expect~0.3 Glashow resonance events with shower-like\ntopologies and the deposited energies above~$300~\\text{TeV}$ per year. It is\ntherefore likely already to have at least one Glashow resonance event in the\nIceCube data set.\n", "  For many membrane proteins the determination of their topology remains a\nchallenge for methods like X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance\n(NMR) spectroscopy. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy has\nevolved as an alternative technique to study structure and dynamics of membrane\nproteins. The present study demonstrates the feasibility of membrane protein\ntopology determination using limited EPR distance and accessibility\nmeasurements. The BCL::MP-Fold (BioChemical Library membrane protein fold)\nalgorithm assembles secondary structure elements (SSEs) in the membrane using a\nMonte Carlo Metropolis (MCM) approach. Sampled models are evaluated using\nknowledge-based potential functions and agreement with the EPR data and a\nknowledge-based energy function. Twenty-nine membrane proteins of up to 696\nresidues are used to test the algorithm. The RMSD100 value of the most accurate\nmodel is better than 8 {\\AA} for twenty-seven, better than 6 {\\AA} for\ntwenty-two and better than 4 {\\AA} for fifteen out of twenty-nine proteins,\ndemonstrating the algorithms ability to sample the native topology. The average\nenrichment could be improved from 1.3 to 2.5, showing the improved\ndiscrimination power by using EPR data.\n", "  Exact calculations are performed on the two-dimensional strongly interacting,\nunpolarized, uniform Fermi gas with a zero-range attractive interaction. Two\nauxiliary-field approaches are employed which accelerate the sampling of\nimaginary-time paths using BCS trial wave functions and a force bias technique.\nTheir combination enables calculations on large enough lattices to reliably\ncompute ground-state properties in the thermodynamic limit. A new equation of\nstate is obtained, with a parametrization provided, which can serve as a\nbenchmark and allow accurate comparisons with experiments. The pressure,\ncontact parameter, and condensate fraction are determined systematically\nvs.~$k_F a$. The momentum distribution, pairing correlation, and the structure\nof the pair wave function are computed. The use of force bias to accelerate the\nMetropolis sampling of auxiliary-fields in determinantal approaches is\ndiscussed.\n", "  Usage of secondary cosmic muons to image the geological structures density\ndistribution significantly developed during the past ten years. Recent\napplications demonstrate the method interest to monitor magma ascent and\nvolcanic gas movements inside volcanoes. Muon radiography could be used to\nmonitor density variations in aquifers and the critical zone in the near\nsurface. However, the time resolution achievable by muon radiography monitoring\nremains poorly studied. It is biased by fluctuation sources exterior to the\ntarget, and statistically affected by the limited number of particles detected\nduring the experiment. The present study documents these two issues within a\nsimple and well constrained experimental context: a water tower. We use the\ndata to discuss the influence of atmospheric variability that perturbs the\nsignal, and propose correction formulas to extract the muon flux variations\nrelated to the water level changes. Statistical developments establish the\nfeasibility domain of muon radiography monitoring as a function of target\nthickness (i.e. opacity). Objects with a thickness comprised between $\\simeq$\n50 $\\pm$ 30m water equivalent correspond to the best time resolution. Thinner\nobjects have a degraded time resolution that strongly depends on the zenith\nangle, whereas thicker objects (like volcanoes) time resolution does not.\n", "  Multi-photon propagation in connected structures - a quantum walk - offers\nthe potential for simulating complex physical systems and provides a route to\nuniversal quantum computation. Increasing the complexity of quantum photonic\nnetworks where the walk occurs is essential for many applications. Here, we\nimplement a quantum walk of indistinguishable photon pairs in a multimode fiber\nsupporting 380 modes. Using wavefront shaping, we control the propagation of\nthe two-photon state through the fiber in which all modes are coupled.\nExcitation of arbitrary output modes of the system is realized by controlling\nclassical and quantum interferences. This experiment demonstrates a highly\nmultimode platform for multi-photon interference experiments and provides a\npowerful method to program a general high-dimensional multiport optical\ncircuit. This work paves the way for the next generation of photonic devices\nfor quantum simulation, computing and communication.\n", "  We propose a new multiscale method to calculate the amplitude of the gradient\nof the linear polarisation vector using a wavelet-based formalism. We\ndemonstrate this method using a field of the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey\n(CGPS) and show that the filamentary structure typically seen in gradients of\nlinear polarisation maps depends strongly on the instrumental resolution. Our\nanalysis reveals that different networks of filaments are present on different\nangular scales. The wavelet formalism allows us to calculate the power spectrum\nof the fluctuations seen in gradients of linear polarisation maps and to\ndetermine the scaling behaviour of this quantity. The power spectrum is found\nto follow a power law with gamma ~ 2.1. We identify a small drop in power\nbetween scales of 80 < l < 300 arcmin, which corresponds well to the overlap in\nthe u-v plane between the Effelsberg 100-m telescope and the DRAO 26-m\ntelescope data. We suggest that this drop is due to undersampling present in\nthe 26-m telescope data. In addition, the wavelet coefficient distributions\nshow higher skewness on smaller scales than at larger scales. The spatial\ndistribution of the outliers in the tails of these distributions creates a\ncoherent subset of filaments correlated across multiple scales, which trace the\nsharpest changes in the polarisation vector P within the field. We suggest that\nthese structures may be associated with highly compressive shocks in the\nmedium. The power spectrum of the field excluding these outliers shows a\nsteeper power law with gamma ~ 2.5.\n", "  The current 3$\\sigma$ discrepancy between experiment and Standard Model\npredictions for $\\pi^0 \\to e^+e^-$ is reconsidered using the Pad\\'e Theory for\nbivariate functions, the Canterbury approximants. This method provides a\nmodel-independent data-driven approximation to the decay as soon as\nexperimental data for the doubly virtual $\\pi^0$ transition form factor are\navailable. It also implements the correct QCD constraints of the form factor\nboth at low- and high-energies. We reassess the Standard Model result\nincluding, for the first time, a systematic error. Our result, BR$(\\pi^0 \\to\ne^+e^-)=6.23(5)\\times 10^{-8}$, still represents a discrepancy larger than\n$2\\sigma$, unsurmountable with our present knowledge of the Standard Model, and\nwould claim New Physics if the experimental result is confirmed by a new\nmeasurement. Our method also provides the adequate tool to extract the doubly\nvirtual form factor from experimental data in a straightforward manner. This\nmeasurement would further shrink our error and establish once and for all the\nNew Physics nature of the discrepancy. In addition, we remark the challenge\nthis discrepancy poses in the evaluation of the hadronic light-by-light\nscattering contribution to the $(g-2)_{\\mu}$, specially confronted with the\nforeseen accuracy of the forthcoming $(g-2)_{\\mu}$ experiments.\n", "  This paper consists of three parts. In part I, we microscopically derive\nGinzburg--Landau (GL) theory from BCS theory for translation-invariant systems\nin which multiple types of superconductivity may coexist. Our motivation are\nunconventional superconductors. We allow the ground state of the effective gap\noperator $K_{T_c}+V$ to be $n$-fold degenerate and the resulting GL theory then\ncouples $n$ order parameters. In part II, we study examples of multi-component\nGL theories which arise from an isotropic BCS theory. We study the cases of (a)\npure $d$-wave order parameters and (b) mixed $(s+d)$-wave order parameters, in\ntwo and three dimensions. In part III, we present explicit choices of\nspherically symmetric interactions $V$ which produce the examples in part II.\nIn fact, we find interactions $V$ which produce ground state sectors of\n$K_{T_c}+V$ of arbitrary angular momentum, for open sets of of parameter\nvalues. This is in stark contrast with Schr\\\"odinger operators $-\\nabla^2+V$,\nfor which the ground state is always non-degenerate. Along the way, we prove\nthe following fact about Bessel functions: At its first maximum, a half-integer\nBessel function is strictly larger than all other half-integer Bessel\nfunctions.\n", "  How universal is human conceptual structure? The way concepts are organized\nin the human brain may reflect distinct features of cultural, historical, and\nenvironmental background in addition to properties universal to human\ncognition. Semantics, or meaning expressed through language, provides direct\naccess to the underlying conceptual structure, but meaning is notoriously\ndifficult to measure, let alone parameterize. Here we provide an empirical\nmeasure of semantic proximity between concepts using cross-linguistic\ndictionaries. Across languages carefully selected from a phylogenetically and\ngeographically stratified sample of genera, translations of words reveal cases\nwhere a particular language uses a single polysemous word to express concepts\nrepresented by distinct words in another. We use the frequency of polysemies\nlinking two concepts as a measure of their semantic proximity, and represent\nthe pattern of such linkages by a weighted network. This network is highly\nuneven and fragmented: certain concepts are far more prone to polysemy than\nothers, and there emerge naturally interpretable clusters loosely connected to\neach other. Statistical analysis shows such structural properties are\nconsistent across different language groups, largely independent of geography,\nenvironment, and literacy. It is therefore possible to conclude the conceptual\nstructure connecting basic vocabulary studied is primarily due to universal\nfeatures of human cognition and language use.\n", "  A rational approach to identify polyatomic molecules that appear to be\npromising candidates for direct Doppler cooling with lasers is outlined.\nFirst-principle calculations for equilibrium structures and Franck--Condon\nfactors of selected representatives with different point-group symmetries\n(including chiral non-symmetric group C$_1$) have been performed and high\npotential for laser-cooling of these molecules is indicated.\n", "  Self-assembly in the laboratory can now yield `information-rich'\nnanostructures in which each component is of a distinct type and has a defined\nspatial position. Ensuring the thermodynamic stability of such structures\nrequires inter-component interaction energies to increase logarithmically with\nstructure size, in order to counter the entropy gained upon mixing component\ntypes in solution. However, self-assembly in the presence of strong\ninteractions results in general in kinetic trapping, so suggesting a limit to\nthe size of an (equilibrium) structure that can be self-assembled from\ndistinguishable components. Here we study numerically a two-dimensional\nhierarchical assembly scheme already considered in experiment. We show that\nthis scheme is immune to the kinetic traps associated with strong `native'\ninteractions (interactions designed to stabilize the intended structure), and\nso, in principle, offers a way to make large information-rich structures. In\nthis scheme the size of an assembled structure scales exponentially with the\nstage of assembly, and assembly can continue as long as random motion is able\nto bring structures into contact. The resulting superstructure could provide a\ntemplate for building in the third dimension. The chief drawback of this scheme\nis that it is particularly susceptible to kinetic traps that result from\n`non-native' interactions (interactions not required to stabilize the intended\nstructure); the scale on which such a scheme can be realized therefore depends\nupon how effectively this latter kind of interaction can be suppressed.\n", "  Recent development of high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) instruments\nenables chemical cross-linking (XL) to become a high-throughput method for\nobtaining structural information about proteins. Restraints derived from XL-MS\nexperiments have been used successfully for structure refinement and\nprotein-protein docking. However, one formidable question is under which\ncircumstances XL-MS data might be sufficient to determine a protein's tertiary\nstructure de novo? Answering this question will not only include understanding\nthe impact of XL-MS data on sampling and scoring within a de novo protein\nstructure prediction algorithm, it must also determine an optimal cross-linker\ntype and length for protein structure determination. While a longer\ncross-linker will yield more restraints, the value of each restraint for\nprotein structure prediction decreases as the restraint is consistent with a\nlarger conformational space.\n  In this study, the number of cross-links and their discriminative power was\nsystematically analyzed in silico on a set of 2,055 non-redundant protein folds\nconsidering Lys-Lys, Lys-Asp, Lys-Glu, Cys-Cys, and Arg-Arg reactive\ncross-linkers between 1 {\\AA} and 60 {\\AA}. Depending on the protein size a\nheuristic was developed that determines the optimal cross-linker length. Next,\nsimulated restraints of variable length were used to de novo predict the\ntertiary structure of fifteen proteins using the BCL::Fold algorithm. The\nresults demonstrate that a distinct cross-linker length exists for which\ninformation content for de novo protein structure prediction is maximized. The\nsampling accuracy improves on average by 1.0 {\\AA} and up to 2.2 {\\AA} in the\nmost prominent example. XL-MS restraints enable consistently an improved\nselection of native-like models with an average enrichment of 2.1.\n", "  Estimates of the total particulate mass of the plumes of Enceladus are\nimportant to constrain theories of particle formation and transport at the\nsurface and interior of the satellite. We revisit the calculations of Ingersoll\n& Ewald (2011), who estimated the particulate mass of the Enceladus plumes from\nstrongly forward scattered light in Cassini ISS images. We model the plume as a\ncombination of spherical particles and irregular aggregates resulting from the\ncoagulation of spherical monomers, the latter of which allows for plumes of\nlower particulate mass. Though a continuum of solutions are permitted by the\nmodel, the best fits to the ISS data consist either of low mass plumes composed\nentirely of small aggregates or high mass plumes composed of mostly spheres.\nThe high particulate mass plumes have total particulate masses of (166 $\\pm$\n42) $\\times$ 10$^3$ kg, consistent with the results of Ingersoll & Ewald\n(2011). The low particulate mass plumes have masses of (25 $\\pm$ 4) $\\times$\n10$^3$ kg, leading to a solid to vapor mass ratio of 0.07 $\\pm$ 0.01 for the\nplume. If indeed the plumes are made of such aggregates, then a vapor-based\norigin for the plume particles cannot be ruled out. Finally, we show that the\nresidence time of the monomers inside the plume vents is sufficiently long for\nBrownian coagulation to form the aggregates before they are ejected to space.\n", "  This paper introduces \"swiveled Renyi entropies\" as an alternative to the\nRenyi entropic quantities put forward in [Berta et al., Phys. Rev. A 91, 022333\n(2015)]. What distinguishes the swiveled Renyi entropies from the prior\nproposal of Berta et al. is that there is an extra degree of freedom: an\noptimization over unitary rotations with respect to particular fixed bases\n(swivels). A consequence of this extra degree of freedom is that the swiveled\nRenyi entropies are ordered, which is an important property of the Renyi family\nof entropies. The swiveled Renyi entropies are however generally discontinuous\nat $\\alpha=1$ and do not converge to the von Neumann entropy-based measures in\nthe limit as $\\alpha\\rightarrow1$, instead bounding them from above and below.\nParticular variants reduce to known Renyi entropies, such as the Renyi relative\nentropy or the sandwiched Renyi relative entropy, but also lead to ordered\nRenyi conditional mutual informations and ordered Renyi generalizations of a\nrelative entropy difference. Refinements of entropy inequalities such as\nmonotonicity of quantum relative entropy and strong subadditivity follow as a\nconsequence of the aforementioned properties of the swiveled Renyi entropies.\nDue to the lack of convergence at $\\alpha=1$, it is unclear whether the\nswiveled Renyi entropies would be useful in one-shot information theory, so\nthat the present contribution represents partial progress toward this goal.\n", "  We revisit the construction of maximal initial data on compact manifolds in\nvacuum with positive cosmological constant via the conformal method. We\ndiscuss, extend and apply recent results of Hebey et al. [19] and Premoselli\n[31] which yield existence, non-existence, (non-)uniqueness and\n(linearisation-) stability of solutions of the Lichnerowicz equation, depending\non its coefficients. We then focus on so-called $(t,\\varphi)$-symmetric data as\n\"seed manifolds\", and in particular on Bowen-York data on the round hypertorus\n$\\mathbb{S}^2 \\times \\mathbb{S}$ (a slice of Nariai) and on Kerr-deSitter. In\nthe former case, we clarify the bifurcation structure of the axially symmetric\nsolutions of the Lichnerowicz equation in terms of the angular momentum as\nbifurcation parameter, using a combination of analytical and numerical\ntechniques. As to the latter example, we show how dynamical data can be\nconstructed in a natural way via conformal rescalings of Kerr-deSitter data.\n", "  A qualitative analysis is given to the data on the full magnetic and velocity\nvector fields in a growing sunspot group, recorded nearly simultaneously with\nthe Solar Optical Telescope on the Hinode satellite. Observations of a young\nbipolar subregion developing within AR 11313 were carried out on 9-10 October\n2011. Our aim was to form am idea about the consistency of the observed pattern\nwith the well-known rising-tube model of the formation of bipolar acrive\nregions and sunspot groups. We find from our magnetograms that the\ndistributions of the vertical [B_v] and the horizontal [B_h] component of the\nmagnetic field over the area of the magnetic subregion are spatially well\ncorrelated; in contrast, the rise of a flux-tube loop would result in a\nqualitatively different pattern, with the maxima of the two magnetic-field\ncomponents spatially separated: the vertical field would be the strongest where\neither spot emerges, while the maximum horizontal-field strengths would be\nreached in between them. A specific feature, which we call the bordering\neffect, is revealed: some local extrema of B_v are bordered with areas of\nlocally enhanced B_h. This effect suggests a fountainlike spatial structure of\nthe magnetic field near the B_v extrema, which is also hardly compatible with\nthe emergence of a flux-tube loop. The vertical-velocity field in the area of\nthe developing active subregion does not exhibit any upflow on the scale of the\nwhole subregion, which should be related to the rising-tube process. Thus, our\nobservational data can hardly be interpreted in the framework of the\nrising-tube model.\n", "  In many fields of science, generalized likelihood ratio tests are established\ntools for statistical inference. At the same time, it has become increasingly\ncommon that a simulator (or generative model) is used to describe complex\nprocesses that tie parameters $\\theta$ of an underlying theory and measurement\napparatus to high-dimensional observations $\\mathbf{x}\\in \\mathbb{R}^p$.\nHowever, simulator often do not provide a way to evaluate the likelihood\nfunction for a given observation $\\mathbf{x}$, which motivates a new class of\nlikelihood-free inference algorithms. In this paper, we show that likelihood\nratios are invariant under a specific class of dimensionality reduction maps\n$\\mathbb{R}^p \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}$. As a direct consequence, we show that\ndiscriminative classifiers can be used to approximate the generalized\nlikelihood ratio statistic when only a generative model for the data is\navailable. This leads to a new machine learning-based approach to\nlikelihood-free inference that is complementary to Approximate Bayesian\nComputation, and which does not require a prior on the model parameters.\nExperimental results on artificial problems with known exact likelihoods\nillustrate the potential of the proposed method.\n", "  The chiral magnetic and chiral separation effects---quantum-anomaly-induced\nelectric current and chiral current along an external magnetic field in\nparity-odd quark-gluon plasma---have received intense studies in the community\nof heavy-ion collision physics. We show that analogous effects occur in\nrotating trapped Fermi gases with Weyl-Zeeman spin-orbit coupling where the\nrotation plays the role of an external magnetic field. These effects can induce\na mass quadrupole in the atomic cloud along the rotation axis which may be\ntested in future experiments. Our results suggest that the spin-orbit coupled\natomic gases are potential simulators of the chiral magnetic and separation\neffects.\n", "  A rotating thin shell in a (2+1)-dimensional asymptotically AdS spacetime is\nstudied. The spacetime exterior to the shell is the rotating BTZ spacetime and\nthe interior is the empty spacetime with a cosmological constant. Through the\nEinstein equation in (2+1)-dimensions and the corresponding junction conditions\nwe calculate the dynamical relevant quantities, namely, the rest\nenergy-density, the pressure, and the angular momentum flux density. We also\nanalyze the matter in a frame where its energy-momentum tensor has a perfect\nfluid form. In addition, we show that Machian effects, such as the dragging of\ninertial frames, also occur in rotating (2+1)-dimensional spacetimes. The weak\nand the dominant energy condition for these shells are discussed.\n", "  We study a numerical solution to Einstein's equation for a compact object\ncomposed of null particles. The solution avoids quantum scale regimes and hence\nneither relies upon nor ignores the interaction of quantum mechanics and\ngravitation. The solution exhibits a deep gravitational well yet remains\nsingularity free. In fact, the solution is geometrically flat in the vicinity\nof the origin with the flat region being of any desirable scale. The solution\nis also observationally distinct from a black hole because a photon from\ninfinity aimed at an object centered on the origin passes through the origin\nand escapes to infinity with a time delay.\n", "  We find an exact formula for the thermally averaged cross section times the\nrelative velocity $\\langle \\sigma v_{\\text{rel}} \\rangle$ with relativistic\nMaxwell-Boltzmann statistics. The formula is valid in the effective field\ntheory approach when the masses of the annihilation products can be neglected\ncompared with the dark matter mass and cut-off scale. The expansion at\n$x=m/T\\gg 1$ directly gives the nonrelativistic limit of $\\langle \\sigma\nv_{\\text{rel}}\\rangle$ which is usually used to compute the relic abundance for\nheavy particles that decouple when they are nonrelativistic. We compare this\nexpansion with the one obtained by expanding the total cross section\n$\\sigma(s)$ in powers of the nonrelativistic relative velocity $v_r$. We show\nthe correct invariant procedure that gives the nonrelativistic average $\\langle\n\\sigma_{nr} v_r \\rangle_{nr}$ coinciding with the large $x$ expansion of\n$\\langle \\sigma v_{\\text{rel}}\\rangle$ in the comoving frame. We explicitly\nformulate flux, cross section, thermal average, collision integral of the\nBoltzmann equation in an invariant way using the true relativistic relative\n$v_\\text{rel}$, showing the uselessness of the M\\o{}ller velocity and further\nelucidating the conceptual and numerical inconsistencies related with its use.\n", "  We present results of a search for two hypothetical strange dibaryon states,\ni.e. the H-dibaryon and the possible $\\bar{\\Lambda\\mathrm{n}}$ bound state. The\nsearch is performed with the ALICE detector in central (0-10%) Pb-Pb collisions\nat $ \\sqrt{s_{\\rm{NN}}} = 2.76$ TeV, by invariant mass analysis in the decay\nmodes $\\bar{\\Lambda\\mathrm{n}} \\rightarrow \\bar{\\mathrm{d}} \\pi^{+} $ and\nH-dibaryon $\\rightarrow \\Lambda \\mathrm{p} \\pi^{-}$. No evidence for these\nbound states is observed. Upper limits are determined at 99% confidence level\nfor a wide range of lifetimes and for the full range of branching ratios. The\nresults are compared to thermal, coalescence and hybrid UrQMD model\nexpectations, which describe correctly the production of other loosely bound\nstates, like the deuteron and the hypertriton.\n", "  We study the stochastic dynamics of coupled states with transition\nprobabilities depending on local persistence, this is, the time since a state\nhas changed. When the population has a preference to adopt older states the\nsystem orders quickly due to the dominance of the old state. When preference\nfor new states prevails, the system can show coexistence of states or\nsynchronized collective behavior resulting in long ordering times. In this\ncase, the magnetization $m(t)$ of the system oscillates around $m(t)=0$.\nImplications for social systems are discussed.\n", "  Transportation processes, which play a prominent role in the life and social\nsciences, are typically described by discrete models on lattices. For studying\ntheir dynamics a continuous formulation of the problem via partial differential\nequations (PDE) is employed. In this paper we propose a symbolic computation\napproach to derive mean-field PDEs from a lattice-based model. We start with\nthe microscopic equations, which state the probability to find a particle at a\ngiven lattice site. Then the PDEs are formally derived by Taylor expansions of\nthe probability densities and by passing to an appropriate limit as the time\nsteps and the distances between lattice sites tend to zero. We present an\nimplementation in a computer algebra system that performs this transition for a\ngeneral class of models. In order to rewrite the mean-field PDEs in a\nconservative formulation, we adapt and implement symbolic integration methods\nthat can handle unspecified functions in several variables. To illustrate our\napproach, we consider an application in crowd motion analysis where the\ndynamics of bidirectional flows are studied. However, the presented approach\ncan be applied to various transportation processes of multiple species with\nvariable size in any dimension, for example, to confirm several proposed\nmean-field models for cell motility.\n", "  We explore bounds of {\\em time-space tradeoffs} in language recognition on\n{\\em two-way finite automata} for some special languages. We prove: (1) a\ntime-space tradeoff upper bound for recognition of the languages $L_{EQ}(n)$ on\n{\\em two-way probabilistic finite automata} (2PFA): $TS={\\bf O}(n\\log n)$,\nwhereas a time-space tradeoff lower bound on {\\em two-way deterministic finite\nautomata} is ${\\bf \\Omega}(n^2)$, (2) a time-space tradeoff upper bound for\nrecognition of the languages $L_{INT}(n)$ on {\\em two-way finite automata with\nquantum and classical states} (2QCFA): $TS={\\bf O}(n^{3/2}\\log n)$, whereas a\nlower bound on 2PFA is $TS={\\bf \\Omega}(n^2)$, (3) a time-space tradeoff upper\nbound for recognition of the languages $L_{NE}(n)$ on exact 2QCFA: $TS={\\bf\nO}(n^{1.87} \\log n)$, whereas a lower bound on 2PFA is $TS={\\bf \\Omega}(n^2)$.\n  It has been proved (Klauck, STOC'00) that the exact one-way quantum finite\nautomata have no advantage comparing to classical finite automata in\nrecognizing languages. However, the result (3) shows that the exact 2QCFA do\nhave an advantage in comparison with their classical counterparts, which has\nbeen the first example showing that the exact quantum computing have advantage\nin time-space tradeoff comparing to classical computing.\n  Usually, two communicating parties, Alice and Bob, are supposed to have an\naccess to arbitrary computational power in {\\em communication complexity} model\nthat is used. Instead of that we will consider communication complexity in such\na setting that two parties are using only finite automata and we prove in this\nsetting that quantum automata are better than classical automata and also\nprobabilistic automata are better than deterministic automata for some well\nknown tasks.\n", "  Superconductivity and magnetism are usually the conflicting (competing)\nphenomena. We show, however, that in nanoscopic objects the electron pairing\nmay promote the magnetic ordering. Such situation is possible at low\ntemperatures in the quantum dots placed between the conducting and\nsuperconducting reservoirs, where the proximity induced electron pairing\ncooperates with the correlations enhancing the spin-exchange interactions. The\nemerging Kondo resonance, which is observable in the Andreev conductance, can\nbe significantly enhanced by the coupling to superconducting lead. We explain\nthis intriguing tendency within the Anderson impurity model using: the\ngeneralized Schrieffer-Wolff canonical transformation, the second order\nperturbative treatment of the Coulomb repulsion, and the nonperturbative\nnumerical renormalization group calculations. We also provide hints for\nexperimental observability of this phenomenon.\n", "  With the standard deviation for the logarithm of the re-scaled range $\\langle\n|F(t+\\tau)-F(t)|\\rangle$ of simulated fractal Brownian motions $F(t)$ given in\na previous paper \\cite{q14}, the method of least squares is adopted to\ndetermine the slope, $S$, and intercept, $I$, of the log$(\\langle\n|F(t+\\tau)-F(t)|\\rangle)$ vs $\\rm{log}(\\tau)$ plot to investigate the\nlimitation of this procedure. It is found that the reduced $\\chi^2$ of the\nfitting decreases with the increase of the Hurst index, $H$ (the expectation\nvalue of $S$), which may be attributed to the correlation among the re-scaled\nranges. Similarly, it is found that the errors of the fitting parameters $S$\nand $I$ are usually smaller than their corresponding standard deviations. These\nresults show the limitation of using the simple least square method to\ndetermine the dimension of a fractal time series. Nevertheless, they may be\nused to reinterpret the fitting results of the least square method to determine\nthe dimension of fractal Brownian motions more self-consistently. The currency\nexchange rate between Euro and Dollar is used as an example to demonstrate this\nprocedure and a fractal dimension of 1.511 is obtained for spans greater than\n30 transactions.\n", "  We study adaptation of a haploid asexual population on a fitness landscape\ndefined over binary genotype sequences of length $L$. We consider greedy\nadaptive walks in which the population moves to the fittest among all single\nmutant neighbors of the current genotype until a local fitness maximum is\nreached. The landscape is of the rough mount Fuji type, which means that the\nfitness value assigned to a sequence is the sum of a random and a deterministic\ncomponent. The random components are independent and identically distributed\nrandom variables, and the deterministic component varies linearly with the\ndistance to a reference sequence. The deterministic fitness gradient $c$ is a\nparameter that interpolates between the limits of an uncorrelated random\nlandscape ($c = 0$) and an effectively additive landscape ($c \\to \\infty$).\nWhen the random fitness component is chosen from the Gumbel distribution,\nexplicit expressions for the distribution of the number of steps taken by the\ngreedy walk are obtained, and it is shown that the walk length varies\nnon-monotonically with the strength of the fitness gradient when the starting\npoint is sufficiently close to the reference sequence. Asymptotic results for\ngeneral distributions of the random fitness component are obtained using\nextreme value theory, and it is found that the walk length attains a\nnon-trivial limit for $L \\to \\infty$, different from its values for $c=0$ and\n$c = \\infty$, if $c$ is scaled with $L$ in an appropriate combination.\n", "  An angular effective mass formalism previously introduced is used to study\nthe density of states in warped and non-warped energy bands. Band warping may\nor may not increase the density-of-states effective mass. Band \"corrugation,\"\nreferring to energy dispersions that deviate \"more severely\" from being\ntwice-differentiable at isolated critical points, may also vary independently\nof density-of-states effective masses and band warping parameters. We\ndemonstrate these effects and the superiority of an angular effective mass\ntreatment for valence band energy dispersions in cubic materials. We also\nprovide some two-dimensional physical and mathematical examples that may be\nrelevant to studies of band warping in heterostructures and surfaces. These\nexamples may also be useful in clarifying the interplay between possible band\nwarping and band non-parabolicity for non-degenerate conduction band minima in\nthermoelectric materials of corresponding interest.\n", "  We discuss several geometric conditions guaranteeing the finiteness or the\ninfiniteness of the discrete spectrum for Robin Laplacians on conical domains.\n", "  We consider continuously monitored quantum systems and introduce definitions\nof work and heat along individual quantum trajectories that are valid for\ncoherent superpositions of energy eigenstates. We use these quantities to\nextend the first and second laws of stochastic thermodynamics to the quantum\ndomain. We illustrate our results with the case of a weakly measured driven\ntwo-level system and show how to distinguish between quantum work and heat\ncontributions. We finally employ quantum feedback control to suppress detector\nbackaction and determine the work statistics.\n", "  We demonstrate improved operation of exchange-coupled semiconductor quantum\ndots by substantially reducing the sensitivity of exchange operations to charge\nnoise. The method involves biasing a double-dot symmetrically between the\ncharge-state anti-crossings, where the derivative of the exchange energy with\nrespect to gate voltages is minimized. Exchange remains highly tunable by\nadjusting the tunnel coupling. We find that this method reduces the dephasing\neffect of charge noise by more than a factor of five in comparison to operation\nnear a charge-state anti-crossing, increasing the number of observable exchange\noscillations in our qubit by a similar factor. Performance also improves with\nexchange rate, favoring fast quantum operations.\n", "  Modern TOF-PET scanner systems require high-speed computing resources for\nefficient data processing, monitoring and image reconstruction. In this article\nwe present the data flow and software architecture for the novel TOF-PET\nscanner developed by the J-PET collaboration. We discuss the data acquisition\nsystem, reconstruction framework and image reconstruction software. Also, the\nconcept of computing outside hospitals in the remote centers such as \\'Swierk\nComputing Centre in Poland is presented.\n", "  The Jagiellonian-PET (J-PET) collaboration is developing a prototype TOF-PET\ndetector based on long polymer scintillators. This novel approach exploits the\nexcellent time properties of the plastic scintillators, which permit very\nprecise time measurements. The very fast, FPGA-based front-end electronics and\nthe data acquisition system, as well as, low- and high-level reconstruction\nalgorithms were specially developed to be used with the J-PET scanner. The\nTOF-PET data processing and reconstruction are time and resource demanding\noperations, especially in case of a large acceptance detector, which works in\ntriggerless data acquisition mode. In this article, we discuss the parallel\ncomputing methods applied to optimize the data processing for the J-PET\ndetector. We begin with general concepts of parallel computing and then we\ndiscuss several applications of those techniques in the J-PET data processing.\n", "  In recent years, layered transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have\nattracted considerable attention because of their rich physics; for example,\nthese materials exhibit superconductivity, charge density waves, and the valley\nHall effect. As a result, TMDs have promising potential applications in\nelectronics, catalysis, and spintronics. Despite the fact that the majority of\nrelated research focuses on semiconducting TMDs (e.g., MoS2), the\ncharacteristics of WTe2 are provoking strong interest in semimetallic TMDs with\nextremely large magnetoresistance, pressure-driven superconductivity, and the\npredicted Weyl semimetal (WSM) state. In this work, we investigate the sister\ncompound of WTe2, MoTe2, which is also predicted to be a WSM and a quantum spin\nHall insulator in bulk and monolayer form, respectively. We find that MoTe2\nexhibits superconductivity with a resistive transition temperature Tc of 0.1 K.\nThe application of a small pressure (such as 0.4 GPa) is shown to dramatically\nenhance the Tc, with a maximum value of 8.2 K being obtained at 11.7 GPa (a\nmore than 80-fold increase in Tc). This yields a dome-shaped superconducting\nphase diagram. Further explorations into the nature of the superconductivity in\nthis system may provide insights into the interplay between strong correlations\nand topological physics.\n", "  Recently reported optical nuclear orientation in the $n$-doped GaAs\nmicrocavity under pumping in nominal transparency region of the crystal [Appl.\nPhys. Lett. $\\mathbf{106}$, 242405 (2015)] has arisen a number of questions,\nthe main of them concerning mechanisms of angular momentum transfer from the\nlight to the nuclear spin system and the nature of the light-related magnetic\nfields accompanying the optical nuclear polarization. In this paper, we use the\nspin noise spectroscopy for magnetometric purposes, particularly, to study\neffective fields acting upon electron spin system of an $n$-GaAs layer inside a\nhigh-Q microcavity in the presence of elliptically polarized probe beam. In\naddition to the external magnetic field applied to the sample in the Voigt\ngeometry and the Overhauser field created by optically oriented nuclei, the\nspin noise spectrum reveals an additional effective, \"optical,\" magnetic field\nproduced by elliptically polarized probe itself. This field is directed along\nthe light propagation axis, with its sign being determined by the sign of the\nprobe helicity and its magnitude depending on degree of circular polarization\nand intensity of the probe beam. We analyze properties of this optical magnetic\nfield and suggest that it results from the optical Stark effect in the field of\nthe elliptically polarized electromagnetic wave.\n", "  We propose a theory of longitudinal resistivity in the normal phase of\nquasi-one-dimensional organic superconductors near the quantum critical point\nwhere antiferromagnetism borders with superconductivity under pressure. The\nlinearized semi-classical Boltzmann equation is solved numerically, fed in by\nthe half-filling electronic umklapp scattering vertex as derived from one-loop\nrenormalization group calculations for the quasi-one-dimensional electron gas\nmodel. The momentum and temperature dependence of umklapp scattering has an\nimportant impact on the behaviour of longitudinal resistivity in the the normal\nphase. Resistivity is found to be linear in temperature around the quantum\ncritical point at which spin-density-wave order joins superconductivity along\nthe antinesting axis, to gradually evolve towards the Fermi liquid behaviour in\nthe limit of weak superconductivity. A comparison is made between theory and\nexperiments performed on the (TMTSF)$_2$PF$_6$ member of the Bechgaard salt\nseries under pressure.\n", "  We provide a rigorous generalization of the quantum adiabatic theorem for\nopen systems described by a Markovian master equation with time-dependent\nLiouvillian $\\mathcal{L}(t)$. We focus on the finite system case relevant for\nadiabatic quantum computing and quantum annealing. Adiabaticity is defined in\nterms of closeness to the instantaneous steady state. While the general result\nis conceptually similar to the closed system case, there are important\ndifferences. Namely, a system initialized in the zero-eigenvalue eigenspace of\n$\\mathcal{L}(t)$ will remain in this eigenspace with a deviation that is\ninversely proportional to the total evolution time $T$. In the case of a finite\nnumber of level crossings the scaling becomes $T^{-\\eta}$ with an exponent\n$\\eta$ that we relate to the rate of the gap closing. For master equations that\ndescribe relaxation to thermal equilibrium, we show that the evolution time $T$\nshould be long compared to the corresponding minimum inverse gap squared of\n$\\mathcal{L}(t)$. Our results are illustrated with several examples.\n", "  In FeSe-derived superconductors, the lack of a systematic and clean control\non the carrier concentration prevents the comprehensive understanding on the\nphase diagram and the interplay between different phases. Here by K dosing and\nangle resolved photoemission study on thick FeSe films and\nFeSe$_{0.93}$S$_{0.07}$ bulk crystals, the phase diagram of FeSe as a function\nof electron doping is established, which is extraordinarily different from\nother Fe-based superconductors. The correlation strength remarkably increases\nwith increasing doping, while an insulting phase emerges in the heavily\noverdoped regime. Between the nematic phase and the insulating phase, a dome of\nenhanced superconductivity is observed, with the maximum superconducting\ntransition temperature of 44$\\pm$2~K. The enhanced superconductivity is\nindependent of the thickness of FeSe, indicating that it is intrinsic to FeSe.\nOur findings provide an ideal system with variable doping for understanding the\ndifferent phases and rich physics in the FeSe family.\n", "  We report results important for the creation of a best-of-both-worlds quantum\nhybrid system consisting of a solid-state source of single photons and an\natomic ensemble as quantum memory. We generate single photons from a GaAs\nquantum dot (QD) frequency-matched to the Rb D2-transitions and then use the Rb\ntransitions to analyze spectrally the quantum dot photons. We demonstrate\nlifetime-limited QD linewidths (1.48 GHz) with both resonant and non-resonant\nexcitation. The QD resonance fluorescence in the low power regime is dominated\nby Rayleigh scattering, a route to match quantum dot and Rb atom linewidths and\nto shape the temporal wave packet of the QD photons. Noise in the solid-state\nenvironment is relatively benign: there is a blinking of the resonance\nfluorescence at MHz rates but negligible upper state dephasing of the QD\ntransition. We therefore establish a close-to-ideal solid-state source of\nsingle photons at a key wavelength for quantum technologies.\n", "  To resolve the controversial issue of the topological nature of the\nelectronic structure of YbB$_{6}$, we have made a combined study using density\nfunctional theory (DFT) and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).\nAccurate determination of the low energy band topology in DFT requires the use\nof modified Becke-Johnson exchange potential incorporating the spin-orbit\ncoupling and the on-site Coulomb interaction $U$ of Yb $4f$ electrons as large\nas 7 eV. We have double-checked the DFT result with the more precise GW band\ncalculation. ARPES is done with the non-polar (110) surface termination to\navoid band bending and quantum well confinement that have confused ARPES\nspectra taken on the polar (001) surface termination. Thereby we show\ndefinitively that YbB$_{6}$ has a topologically trivial B 2$p$-Yb 5$d$\nsemiconductor band gap, and hence is a non-Kondo non-topological insulator\n(TI). In agreement with theory, ARPES shows pure divalency for Yb and a $p$-$d$\nband gap of 0.3 eV, which clearly rules out both of the previous scenarios of\n$f$-$d$ band inversion Kondo TI and $p$-$d$ band inversion non-Kondo TI. We\nhave also examined the pressure-dependent electronic structure of YbB$_{6}$,\nand found that the high pressure phase is not a Kondo TI but a\n\\emph{p}-\\emph{d} overlap semimetal.\n", "  In order to illuminate the properties of current fluctuations in more than\none dimension, we use a lattice-based Markov process driven into a\nnon-equilibrium steady state. Specifically, we perform a detailed study of the\nparticle current fluctuations in a two-dimensional zero-range process with open\nboundary conditions and probe the influence of the underlying geometry by\ncomparing results from a square and a triangular lattice. Moreover, we examine\nthe structure of local currents corresponding to a given global current\nfluctuation and comment on the role of spatial inhomogeneities for the\ndiscrepancies observed in testing some recent fluctuation symmetries.\n", "  Based on Kitaev-Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM)\ninteractions, we studied nature of possible magnetic phases in frustrated\nhyperkagome iridate, Na$_4$Ir$_{3}$O$_8$ (Na-438). Using Monte-Carlo\nsimulation, we showed that the phase diagram is mostly covered by two competing\nmagnetic ordered phases; Z$_2$ symmetry breaking (SB) phase and Z$_6$ SB phase,\nlatter of which is stabilized by the classical order by disorder. These two\nphases are separated by a first order phase transition line with Z$_8$-like\nsymmetry. The critical nature at the Z$_6$ SB ordering temperature is\ncharacterized by the 3D XY universality class, below which U(1) to Z$_6$\ncrossover phenomena appears; the Z$_6$ spin anisotropy becomes irrelevant in a\nlength scale shorter than a crossover length $\\Lambda_*$ while becomes relevant\notherwise. A possible phenomenology of polycrystalline Na-438 is discussed\nbased on this crossover phenomena.\n", "  Coherent radiation at radio frequencies from high-energy showers fully\ncontained in a dense radio-transparent medium - like ice, salt or regolith -\nhas been extensively investigated as a promising technique to search for\nultra-high energy (UHE) neutrinos. Additional emission in the form of\ntransition radiation may occur when a neutrino-induced shower produced close to\nthe Earth surface emerges from the ground into atmospheric air. We present the\nfirst detailed evaluation of transition radiation from high-energy showers\ncrossing the boundary between two different media. We found that transition\nradiation is sizable over a wide solid angle and coherent up to $\\sim$ 1 GHz.\nThese properties encourage further work to evaluate the potential of a\nlarge-aperture UHE neutrino experiment based on detection of transition\nradiation.\n", "  In this work we proof that boson sampling with $N$ particles in $M$ modes is\nequivalent to short-time evolution with $N$ excitations in an XY model of $2N$\nspins. This mapping is efficient whenever the boson bunching probability is\nsmall, and errors can be efficiently postselected. This mapping opens the door\nto boson sampling with quantum simulators or general purpose quantum computers,\nand highlights the complexity of time-evolution with critical spin models, even\nfor very short times.\n", "  In this paper, we study the inequality indices for some models of wealth\nexchange. We calculated Gini index and newly introduced k-index and compare the\nresults with reported empirical data available for different countries. We have\nfound lower and upper bounds for the indices and discuss the efficiencies of\nthe models. Some exact analytical calculations are given for a few cases. We\nalso exactly compute the quantities for Gamma and double Gamma distributions.\n", "  Klein-Gordon gravity, 1920s-30s particle physics, and 1890s Neumann-Seeliger\nmodified gravity suggest a \"graviton mass term\" *algebraic* in the potential.\nUnlike Nordstr\\\"om's \"massless\" theory, massive scalar gravity is invariant\nunder the Poincar\\'e group but not the 15-parameter conformal group. It thus\nexhibits the whole Minkowski space-time structure, indirectly for volumes.\nMassive scalar gravity is plausible as a field theory, but violates Einstein's\nprinciples of general covariance, general relativity, equivalence, and Mach.\nGeometry is a poor guide: matter sees a conformally flat metric due to\nuniversal coupling, but gravity sees the rest of the flat metric (on long\ndistances) in the mass term. What is the `true' geometry, in line with\nPoincar\\'e's modal conventionality argument? Infinitely many theories exhibit\nthis bimetric `geometry,' all with the total stress-energy's trace as source;\ngeometry does not explain the field equations. The irrelevance of the\nEhlers-Pirani-Schild construction to conventionalism is evident given\nmulti-geometry theories. As Seeliger envisaged, the smooth massless limit\nyields underdetermination between massless and massive scalar gravities---an\nunconceived alternative. One version easily could have been developed before\nGR; it would have motivated thinking of Einstein's equations along the lines of\nhis newly reappreciated \"physical strategy\" and suggested a rivalry from\nmassive spin 2 for GR (massless spin 2, Pauli-Fierz 1939). The\nPutnam-Gr\\\"unbaum debate on conventionality is revisited given a broad modal\nscope. Massive scalar gravity licenses a historically plausible rational\nreconstruction of much of space-time philosophy in light of particle physics.\nAn appendix reconsiders the Malament-Weatherall-Manchak conformal restriction\nof conventionality and constructs the `universal force' in the null cones.\n", "  We consider the inverse problem of determining all extreme black hole\nsolutions to the Einstein equations with a prescribed near-horizon geometry. We\ninvestigate this problem by considering infinitesimal deformations of the\nnear-horizon geometry along transverse null geodesics. We show that, up to a\ngauge transformation, the linearised Einstein equations reduce to an elliptic\nPDE for the extrinsic curvature of a cross-section of the horizon. We deduce\nthat for a given near-horizon geometry there exists a finite dimensional moduli\nspace of infinitesimal transverse deformations. We then establish a uniqueness\ntheorem for transverse deformations of the extreme Kerr horizon. In particular,\nwe prove that the only smooth axisymmetric transverse deformation of the\nnear-horizon geometry of the extreme Kerr black hole, such that cross-sections\nof the horizon are marginally trapped surfaces, corresponds to that of the\nextreme Kerr black hole. Furthermore, we determine all smooth and\nbiaxisymmetric transverse deformations of the near-horizon geometry of the\nfive-dimensional extreme Myers-Perry black hole with equal angular momenta. We\nfind a three parameter family of solutions such that cross-sections of the\nhorizon are marginally trapped, which is more general than the known black hole\nsolutions. We discuss the possibility that they correspond to new five\ndimensional vacuum black holes.\n", "  Graphene hosts a unique electron system in which electron-phonon scattering\nis extremely weak but electron-electron collisions are sufficiently frequent to\nprovide local equilibrium above liquid nitrogen temperature. Under these\nconditions, electrons can behave as a viscous liquid and exhibit hydrodynamic\nphenomena similar to classical liquids. Here we report strong evidence for this\ntransport regime. We find that doped graphene exhibits an anomalous (negative)\nvoltage drop near current injection contacts, which is attributed to the\nformation of submicrometer-size whirlpools in the electron flow. The viscosity\nof graphene's electron liquid is found to be ~0.1 m$^2$ /s, an order of\nmagnitude larger than that of honey, in agreement with many-body theory. Our\nwork shows a possibility to study electron hydrodynamics using high quality\ngraphene.\n", "  Coherent Quantum Phase Slip consists in the coherent transfer of vortices in\nsuperfluids. We investigate this phenomenon in two miscible coherently coupled\ncomponents of a spinor Bose gas confined in a toroidal trap. After imprinting\ndifferent vortex states on each component, we demonstrate that during the whole\ndynamics the system remains in a linear superposition of two current states in\nspite of the non-linearity and can be mapped onto a linear Josephson problem.\nWe propose this system as a good candidate for the realization of a\nMooij-Harmans qubit and remark its feasibility for implementation in current\nexperiments with $^{87}\\mbox{Rb}$, since we have used values for the physical\nparameters currently available in laboratories.\n", "  We propose a novel approach to the recognition of particular classes of\nnon-conventional events in signals from phase-sensitive optical\ntime-domain-reflectometry-based sensors. Our algorithmic solution has two main\nfeatures: filtering aimed at the de-nosing of signals and a Gaussian mixture\nmodel to cluster them. We test the proposed algorithm using experimentally\nmeasured signals. The results show that two classes of events can be\ndistinguished with the best-case recognition probability close to 0.9 at\nsufficient numbers of training samples.\n", "  We study a sample of 21 young and active solar-type stars with spectral types\nranging from late F to mid K and characterize the behaviour of their activity.\nWe apply the continuous period search (CPS) time series analysis method on 16\nto 27 years of photometry to estimate the surface differential rotation and\ndetermine the existence and behaviour of active longitudes and activity cycles\non the stars. We supplement the time series results by calculating new\n$\\log{R'_{\\rm HK}}$ emission indices for the stars from high resolution\nspectroscopy. The photometric rotation period variations reveal a positive\ncorrelation between the relative differential rotation coefficient and the\nrotation period, but do not reveal any dependence of the differential rotation\non the effective temperature of the stars. Secondary period searches reveal\nactivity cycles in 18 of the stars and temporary or persistent active\nlongitudes in 11 of them. The activity cycles fall into specific activity\nbranches. We find a new split into sub-branches, indicating multiple\nsimultaneously present cycle modes. Active longitudes appear to be present only\non the more active stars. There is a sharp break at approximately $\\log{R'_{\\rm\nHK}}=-4.46$ separating the less active stars with long-term axisymmetric spot\ndistributions from the more active ones with non-axisymmetric configurations.\nIn seven out of eleven of our stars with clearly detected long-term\nnon-axisymmetric spot activity the estimated active longitude periods are\nsignificantly shorter than the mean photometric rotation periods. This\nsystematic trend can be interpreted either as a sign of the active longitudes\nbeing sustained from a deeper level in the stellar interior than the individual\nspots or as azimuthal dynamo waves exhibiting prograde propagation.\n", "  Two-nucleon axial charge and current operators are derived in chiral\neffective field theory up to one loop. The derivation is based on time-ordered\nperturbation theory, and accounts for cancellations between the contributions\nof irreducible diagrams and the contributions due to non-static corrections\nfrom energy denominators of reducible diagrams. Ultraviolet divergencies\nassociated with the loop corrections are isolated in dimensional\nregularization. The resulting axial current is finite and conserved in the\nchiral limit, while the axial charge requires renormalization. A complete set\nof contact terms for the axial charge up to the relevant order in the power\ncounting is constructed.\n", "  I give in this lecture an overview of the features of the Mathematica package\nSARAH, and explain how it can be used together with other codes to study all\naspects of a BSM model. The focus will be on the description of the analytical\ncalculations which SARAH can perform and how this information is used to\ngenerate automatically a spectrum generator based on SPheno. I also summarize\nthe main aspects of the other interfaces to public codes like\nHiggsBounds/HiggsSignals, FeynArts/FormCalc, CalcHep, MicrOmegas, WHIZARD,\nVevacious or MadGraph. The appendix contains a short tutorial about the\nimplementation and usage of a new model.\n", "  We use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and quasiparticle interference\n(QPI) imaging to investigate the low-energy orbital texture of single-layer\nFeSe/SrTiO$_3$. We develop a $T$-matrix model of multi-orbital QPI to\ndisentangle scattering intensities from Fe $3d_{xz}$ and $3d_{yz}$ bands,\nenabling the use of STM as a nanoscale detection tool of nematicity. By\nsampling multiple spatial regions of a single-layer FeSe/SrTiO$_3$ film, we\nquantitatively exclude static $xz/yz$ orbital ordering with domain size larger\nthan $\\delta r^2$ = 20 nm $\\times$ 20 nm, $xz/yz$ Fermi wave vector difference\nlarger than $\\delta k$ = 0.014 $\\pi$, and energy splitting larger than $\\delta\nE$ = 3.5 meV. The lack of detectable ordering pinned around defects places\nqualitative constraints on models of fluctuating nematicity.\n", "  We measure the far-infrared emission of the general quasar (QSO) population\nusing Planck observations of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey QSO\nsample. By applying multi-component matched multi-filters to the seven highest\nPlanck frequencies, we extract the amplitudes of dust, synchrotron and thermal\nSunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signals for nearly 300,000 QSOs over the redshift range\n$0.1<z<5$. We bin these individually low signal-to-noise measurements to obtain\nthe mean emission properties of the QSO population as a function of redshift.\nThe emission is dominated by dust at all redshifts, with a peak at $z \\sim 2$,\nthe same location as the peak in the general cosmic star formation rate.\nRestricting analysis to radio-loud QSOs, we find synchrotron emission with a\nmonochromatic luminosity at $100\\,\\rm{GHz}$ (rest-frame) rising from\n$\\overline{L_{\\rm synch}}=0$ to $0.2 \\, {\\rm L_\\odot} {\\rm Hz}^{-1}$ between\n$z=0$ and 3. The radio-quiet subsample does not show any synchrotron emission,\nbut we detect thermal SZ between $z=2.5$ and 4; no significant SZ emission is\nseen at lower redshifts. Depending on the supposed mass for the halos hosting\nthe QSOs, this may or may not leave room for heating of the halo gas by\nfeedback from the QSO.\n", "  We use the extension of the Minimal Geometric Deformation approach, recently\ndeveloped to investigate the exterior of a self-gravitating system in the\nBraneworld, to identified a master solution for the deformation undergone by\nthe radial metric component when time deformations are produced by bulk\ngravitons. A specific form for the temporal deformation is used to generate a\nnew exterior solution with a tidal charge $Q$. The main feature of this\nsolution is the presence of higher-order terms in the tidal charge, thus\ngeneralizing the well known tidally charged solution. The horizon of the black\nhole lies inside the Schwarzschild radius, $h<r_s=2\\,{\\cal M}$, indicating that\nextra-dimensional effects weaken the gravitational field.\n", "  We have developed a function which describes SiPM response in both small\nsignal and highly saturated regimes. The function includes the reactivation of\nSiPM pixels during a single input light pulse, and results in an approximately\nlinear increase of SiPM response in the highly saturated regime, as observed in\nreal SiPMs. This article shows that the function can accurately describe the\nmeasured response of real SiPM devices over a wide range of signal intensities.\n", "  Understanding light-matter interactions using localized surface plasmons\n(LSPs) is of fundamental interest in classical and quantum plasmonics and has a\nwide range of applications. In order to understand the spatial properties of\nLSPs, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) is a common and powerful method\nof spatially resolving the extreme localized fields that can be obtained with\nmetal resonators. However, modelling EELS for general shaped resonators\npresents a major challenge in computational electrodynamics, requiring the full\nphoton Green function as a function of two space points and frequency. Here we\npresent an intuitive and computationally simple method for computing EELS maps\nof plasmonic resonators using a quasinormal mode (QNM) expansion technique. By\nseparating the contribution of the QNM and the bulk material, we give\nclosed-form analytical formulas for the plasmonic QNM contribution to the EELS\nmaps. We exemplify our technique for a split ring resonator, a gold nanorod,\nand a nanorod dimer structure. The method is accurate, intuitive, and gives\norders of magnitude improvements over direct dipole simulations that\nnumerically solve the full 3D Maxwell equations. We also show how the same QNM\nGreen function can be used to obtain the Purcell factor (and projected local\ndensity of optical states) from quantum dipole emitters or two level atoms, and\nwe demonstrate how the spectral features differ in general to the EELS\nspectrum.\n", "  We report on an absolute measurement of the electronic spin polarization of\nthe $\\nu=1$ integer quantum Hall state. The spin polarization is extracted in\nthe vicinity of $\\nu=1$ (including at exactly $\\nu=1$) via resistive NMR\nexperiments performed at different magnetic fields (electron densities), and\nZeeman energy configurations. At the lowest magnetic fields, the polarization\nis found to be complete in a narrow region around $\\nu=1$. Increasing the\nmagnetic field (electron density) induces a significant depolarization of the\nsystem, which we attribute to a transition between the quantum Hall ferromagnet\nand the Skyrmion glass phase theoretically expected as the ratio between\nCoulomb interactions and disorder is increased. These observations account for\nthe fragility of the polarization previously observed in high mobility 2D\nelectron gas, and experimentally demonstrate the existence of an optimal amount\nof disorder to stabilize the ferromagnetic state.\n", "  Self-poisoning is a kinetic trap that can impair or prevent crystal growth in\na wide variety of physical settings. Here we use dynamic mean-field theory and\ncomputer simulation to argue that poisoning is ubiquitous because its emergence\nrequires only the notion that a molecule can bind in two (or more) ways to a\ncrystal; that those ways are not energetically equivalent; and that the\nassociated binding events occur with sufficiently unequal probability. If these\nconditions are met then the steady-state growth rate is in general a\nnon-monotonic function of the thermodynamic driving force for crystal growth,\nwhich is the characteristic of poisoning. Our results also indicate that\nrelatively small changes of system parameters could be used to induce recovery\nfrom poisoning.\n", "  The Einstein Equivalence Principle is a fundamental principle of the theory\nof General Relativity. While this principle has been thoroughly tested with\nstandard matter, the question of its validity in the Dark sector remains open.\nIn this paper, we consider a general tensor-scalar theory that allows to test\nthe equivalence principle in the Dark sector by introducing two different\nconformal couplings to standard matter and to Dark matter. We constrain these\ncouplings by considering galactic observations of strong lensing and of\nvelocity dispersion. Our analysis shows that, in the case of a violation of the\nEinstein Equivalence Principle, data favour violations through coupling\nstrengths that are of opposite signs for ordinary and Dark matter. At the same\ntime, our analysis does not show any significant deviations from General\nRelativity.\n", "  Quantum steering can be detected via the violation of steering inequalities,\nwhich provide sufficient conditions for the steerability of quantum states.\nHere we discuss the converse problem, namely ensuring that a state is\nunsteerable, and hence Bell local. We present a simple criterion, applicable to\nany two-qubit state, which guarantees that the state admits a local hidden\nstate model for arbitrary projective measurements. We find new classes of\nunsteerable entangled states, which can thus not violate any steering or Bell\ninequality. In turn, this leads to sufficient conditions for a state to be only\none-way steerable, and provides the simplest possible example of one-way\nsteering. Finally, by exploiting the connection between steering and\nmeasurement incompatibility, we give a sufficient criterion for a continuous\nset of qubit measurements to be jointly measurable.\n", "  We present a theoretical study for the scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)\nspectra of surface-supported magnetic nanostructures, incorporating strong\ncorrelation effects. As concrete examples, we study Co and Mn adatoms on the\nCu(111) surface, which are expected to represent the opposite limits of the\nKondo physics and local moment behavior, using a combination of density\nfunctional theory and both quantum Monte Carlo and exact diagonalization\nimpurity solvers. We examine in detail the effects of temperature $T$,\ncorrelation strength $U$, and the impurity $d$ electron occupancy $N_d$ on the\nlocal density of states. We also study the effective coherence energy scale,\ni.e., the Kondo temperature $T_K$, which can be extracted from the STM spectra.\nTheoretical STM spectra are computed as a function of the STM tip position\nrelative to each adatom. Because of the multi-orbital nature of the adatoms,\nthe STM spectra are shown to consist of a complicated superposition of orbital\ncontributions, with different orbital symmetries, self-energies and Kondo\ntemperatures. For the Mn adatom, which is close to half-filling, the STM\nspectra are featureless near the Fermi level. On the other hand, the\nquasiparticle peak for Co adatom gives rise to strongly position-dependent Fano\nline-shapes.\n", "  The generalization of the Dyson Brownian Motion approach of random matrices\nto Anderson Localization (AL) models [Chalker, Lerner and Smith PRL 77, 554\n(1996)] and to Many-Body Localization (MBL) Hamiltonians [Serbyn and Moore\narxiv:1508.07293] is revisited to extract the level repulsion exponent $\\beta$,\nwhere $\\beta=1$ in the delocalized phase governed by the Wigner-Dyson\nstatistics, $\\beta=0$ in the localized phase governed by the Poisson\nstatistics, and $0<\\beta_c<1$ at the critical point. The idea is that the\nGaussian disorder variables $h_i$ are promoted to Gaussian stationary processes\n$h_i(t)$ in order to sample the disorder stationary distribution with some time\ncorrelation $\\tau$. The statistics of energy levels can be then studied via\nLangevin and Fokker-Planck equations. For the MBL quantum spin Hamiltonian with\nrandom fields $h_i$, we obtain $\\beta =2q^{EA}_{n,n+1}(N)/q^{EA}_{n,n}(N) $ in\nterms of the Edwards-Anderson matrix $q^{EA}_{nm}(N) \\equiv \\frac{1}{N}\n\\sum_{i=1}^N | < \\phi_n | \\sigma_i^z | \\phi_m> |^2 $ for the same eigenstate\n$m=n$ and for consecutive eigenstates $m=n+1$. For the Anderson Localization\ntight-binding Hamiltonian with random on-site energies $h_i$, we find $\\beta =2\nY_{n,n+1}(N)/(Y_{n,n}(N)-Y_{n,n+1}(N)) $ in terms of the Density Correlation\nmatrix $Y_{nm}(N) \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^N | < \\phi_n | i> |^2 | <i | \\phi_m> |^2 $\nfor consecutive eigenstates $m=n+1$, while the diagonal element $m=n$\ncorresponds to the Inverse Participation Ratio $Y_{nn}(N) \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^N |\n< \\phi_n | i> |^4 $ of the eigenstate $| \\phi_n>$.\n", "  In the last few years, it became possible to observationally resolve galaxies\nwith two distinct nuclei in their centre. For separations smaller than 10kpc,\ndual and offset active galactic nuclei (AGN) are distinguished: in dual AGN,\nboth nuclei are active, whereas in offset AGN only one nucleus is active. To\nstudy the origin of such AGN pairs, we employ a cosmological, hydrodynamic\nsimulation with a large volume of (182Mpc)^3 from the set of Magneticum\nPathfinder Simulations. The simulation self-consistently produces 35 resolved\nblack hole (BH) pairs at redshift z=2, with a comoving distance smaller than\n10kpc. 14 of them are offset AGN and nine are dual AGN, resulting in a fraction\nof (1.2 \\pm 0.3)% AGN pairs with respect to the total number of AGN. In this\npaper, we discuss fundamental differences between the BH and galaxy properties\nof dual AGN, offset AGN and inactive BH pairs and investigate their different\ntriggering mechanisms. We find that in dual AGN the BHs have similar masses and\nthe corresponding BH from the less massive progenitor galaxy always accretes\nwith a higher Eddington ratio. In contrast, in offset AGN the active BH is\ntypically more massive than its non-active counterpart. Furthermore, dual AGN\nin general accrete more gas from the intergalactic medium than offset AGN and\nnon-active BH pairs. This highlights that merger events, particularly minor\nmergers, do not necessarily lead to strong gas inflows and thus, do not always\ndrive strong nuclear activity.\n", "  We show that Jastrow-Slater wave functions, in which a density-density\nJastrow factor is applied onto an uncorrelated fermionic state, may possess\nlong-range order even when all symmetries are preserved in the wave function.\nThis fact is mainly related to the presence of a sufficiently strong Jastrow\nterm (also including the case of full Gutzwiller projection, suitable for\ndescribing spin models). Selected examples are reported, including the spawning\nof N\\'eel order and dimerization in spin systems, and the stabilization of\ncharge and orbital order in itinerant electronic systems.\n", "  Recently, we have shown that the propagation speed $c_T$ of the primordial\ngravitational waves (GWs) might be nontrivially varying during inflation, which\ncould induce local oscillations in the power spectrum of primordial GWs. In\nthis paper, we numerically confirm that, although with a disformal redefinition\nof the metric the nontrivial $c_T$ may be set as unity, the power spectrum in\nthe frame with $c_T=1$ is completely the same as that in the original disformal\nframe, i.e., the oscillating shape in the power spectrum is still reserved,\nsince here the effect of $c_T$ is actually encoded in the nontrivially varying\nHubble parameter. In addition, we also clarify how to obtain a blue-tilted GWs\nspectrum by imposing a rapidly decreasing $c_T$ during inflation.\n", "  To distinguish the contributions to the generalized Hurwitz number of the\nsource Riemann surface with different genus, we define the genus expanded\ncut-and-join operators by observing carefully the symplectic surgery and the\ngluing formulas of the relative GW-invariants. As an application, we get some\ndifferential equations for the generating functions of the generalized Hurwitz\nnumbers for the source Riemann surface with different genus, thus we can\nexpress the generating functions in terms of the genus expanded cut-and-join\noperators.\n", "  The development and production of radio frequency quadrupoles, which are used\nfor accelerating low-energy ions to high energies, continues since 1970s. The\ndevelopment of RFQ design software packages, which can provide ease of use with\na graphical interface, can visualize the behavior of the ion beam inside the\nRFQ, and can run on both Unix and Windows platforms, has become inevitable due\nto increasing interest around the world. In this context, a new RFQ design\nsoftware package, DEMIRCI, has been under development. To meet the user\nexpectations, a number of new features have been recently added to DEMIRCI.\nApart from being usable via both graphical interface and command line, DEMIRCI\nhas been enriched with beam dynamics calculations. This new module gives users\nthe possibility to define and track an input beam and to monitor its behavior\nalong the RFQ. Additionally, the Windows OS has been added to the list of\nsupported platforms. Finally, the addition of more realistic 8 term potential\nresults has been ongoing. This note will summarize the latest developments and\nresults from DEMIRCI RFQ design software.\n", "  Various extensions of the Standard Model motivate the existence of stable\nmagnetic monopoles that could have been created during an early high-energy\nepoch of the Universe. These primordial magnetic monopoles would be gradually\naccelerated by cosmic magnetic fields and could reach high velocities that make\nthem visible in Cherenkov detectors such as IceCube.\n  Equivalently to electrically charged particles, magnetic monopoles produce\ndirect and indirect Cherenkov light while traversing through matter at\nrelativistic velocities.\n  This paper describes searches for relativistic (v>0.76c) and mildly\nrelativistic (v>0.51c) monopoles, each using one year of data taken in 2008/09\nand 2011/12 respectively. No monopole candidate was detected. For a velocity\nabove 0.51c the monopole flux is constrained down to a level of 1.55x10^-18\ncm-2 s-1 sr-1. This is an improvement of almost two orders of magnitude over\nprevious limits.\n", "  There exist several recent studies of the top-quark CEDM in the context of\nsearching for CP violating signals in top-quark pair production at the LHC.\nMost of these studies constrain the CEDM either from deviations in the top-pair\ncross section from its standard model value, or from T-odd asymmetries in the\ndimuon channel. Motivated by ATLAS and CMS interest, we extend the study of\nT-odd asymmetries to the lepton plus jets channel. At the parton level, using\nMadGraph, we identify the most promising signals and their statistical\nsensitivity. We find that the signals with larger sensitivity to the CEDM\nrequire distinguishing between $b$ and $\\bar{b}$ jets and propose a simple way\nto address this.\n", "  We model the inspiral of a compact stellar-mass object into a massive\nnonrotating black hole including all dissipative and conservative\nfirst-order-in-the-mass-ratio effects on the orbital motion. The techniques we\ndevelop allow inspirals with initial eccentricities as high as $e\\sim0.8$ and\ninitial separations as large as $p\\sim 50$ to be evolved through many thousands\nof orbits up to the onset of the plunge into the black hole. The inspiral is\ncomputed using an osculating elements scheme driven by a hybridized self-force\nmodel, which combines Lorenz-gauge self-force results with highly accurate flux\ndata from a Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli code. The high accuracy of our hybrid\nself-force model allows the orbital phase of the inspirals to be tracked to\nwithin $\\sim0.1$ radians or better. The difference between self-force models\nand inspirals computed in the radiative approximation is quantified.\n", "  Community detection of network flows conventionally assumes one-step dynamics\non the links. For sparse networks and interest in large-scale structures,\nlonger timescales may be more appropriate. Oppositely, for large networks and\ninterest in small-scale structures, shorter timescales may be better. However,\ncurrent methods for analyzing networks at different timescales require\nexpensive and often infeasible network reconstructions. To overcome this\nproblem, we introduce a method that takes advantage of the inner-workings of\nthe map equation and evades the reconstruction step. This makes it possible to\nefficiently analyze large networks at different Markov times with no extra\noverhead cost. The method also evades the costly unipartite projection for\nidentifying flow modules in bipartite networks.\n", "  We investigate the maximally coherent states to provide a refinement in\nquantifying coherence and give a measure-independent definition of the\ncoherence-preserving operations. A maximally coherent state can be considered\nas the resource to create arbitrary quantum states of the same dimension by\nmerely incoherent operations. We propose that only the maximally coherent\nstates should achieve the maximal value for a coherence measure and use this\ncondition as an additional criterion for coherence measures to obtain a\nrefinement in quantifying coherence which excludes the invalid and inefficient\ncoherence measures. Under this new criterion, we then give a\nmeasure-independent definition of the coherence-preserving operations, which\nplay a similar role in quantifying coherence as that played by the local\nunitary operations in the scenario of studying entanglement.\n", "  We propose a unifying model for FQHE which on the one hand connects it to\nrecent developments in string theory and on the other hand leads to new\npredictions for the principal series of experimentally observed FQH systems\nwith filling fraction $\\nu ={n\\over 2n\\pm1}$ as well as those with $\\nu\n={m\\over m+2}$. Our model relates these series to minimal unitary models of the\nVirasoro and superVirasoro algebra and is based on $SL(2, {\\bf C})$\nChern-Simons theory in Euclidean space or $SL(2,{\\bf R})\\times SL(2,{\\bf R})$\nChern-Simons theory in Minkowski space. This theory, which has also been\nproposed as a soluble model for 2+1 dimensional quantum gravity, and its N=1\nsupersymmetric cousin, provide effective descriptions of FQHE. The principal\nseries corresponds to quantized levels for the two $SL(2,{\\bf R})$'s such that\nthe diagonal $SL(2,{\\bf R})$ has level $ 1$. The model predicts, contrary to\nstandard lore, that for principal series of FQH systems the quasiholes possess\nnon-abelian statistics. For the multi-layer case we propose that complex ADE\nChern-Simons theories provide effective descriptions, where the rank of the ADE\nis mapped to the number of layers. Six dimensional $(2,0)$ ADE theories on the\nRiemann surface $\\Sigma$ provides a realization of FQH systems in M-theory.\nMoreover we propose that the q-deformed version of Chern-Simons theories are\nrelated to the anisotropic limit of FQH systems which splits the zeroes of the\nLaughlin wave function. Extensions of the model to 3+1 dimensions, which\nrealize topological insulators with non-abelian topologically twisted\nYang-Mills theory is pointed out.\n", "  We investigate the effect of coupling Anderson localized particles in one\ndimension to a system of marginally localized phonons having a symmetry\nprotected delocalized mode at zero frequency. This situation is naturally\nrealized for electrons coupled to phonons in a disordered nano-wire as well as\nfor ultra-cold fermions coupled to phonons of a superfluid in a one dimensional\ndisordered trap. To determine if the coupled system can be many-body localized\nwe analyze the phonon-mediated hopping transport for both the weak and strong\ncoupling regimes. We show that the usual variable-range hopping mechanism\ninvolving a low-order phonon processes is ineffective at low temperature due to\ndiscreteness of the bath at the required energy. Instead, the system\nthermalizes through a many-body process involving exchange of a diverging\nnumber $n\\propto -\\log T$ of phonons in the low temperature limit. This effect\nleads to a highly singular prefactor to Mott's well known formula and strongly\nsuppresses the variable range hopping rate. Finally we comment on possible\nimplications of this physics in higher dimensional electron-phonon coupled\nsystems.\n", "  In this paper we study the phase diagram of a disordered, spin-orbit coupled\nsuperconductor with $s$-wave or $d+id$-wave pairing symmetry in symmetry class\n$D$. We analyze the topological phase transitions by applying three different\nmethods which include a disorder averaged entanglement entropy, a disorder\naveraged real-space Chern number, and an evaluation of the momentum space Chern\nnumber in a disorder averaged effective model. We find evidence for a\ndisorder-induced topological state. While in the clean limit there is a single\nphase transition from a trivial phase with a Chern number $C=4$ to a\ntopological phase with $C=1$, in the disordered system there is an intermediate\nphase with $C=3$. The phase transition from the trivial $C=4$ phase into the\nintermediate phase with $C=3$ is seen in the real-space calculation of the\nChern number. In spite of this, this phase transition is not detectable in the\nentanglement entropy. A second phase transition from the disorder induced $C=3$\ninto the $C=1$ phase is seen in all three quantities.\n", "  The Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli (RWZ) wave-equation describes Schwarzschild-Droste\nblack hole perturbations. The source term contains a Dirac distribution and its\nderivative. We have previously designed a method of integration in time domain.\nIt consists of a finite difference scheme where analytic expressions, dealing\nwith the wave-function discontinuity through the jump conditions, replace the\ndirect integration of the source and the potential. Herein, we successfully\napply the same method to the geodesic generic orbits of EMRI (Extreme Mass\nRatio Inspiral) sources, at second order. An EMRI is a Compact Star (CS)\ncaptured by a Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH). These are considered the best\nprobes for testing gravitation in strong regime. The gravitational wave-forms,\nthe radiated energy and angular momentum at infinity are computed and\nextensively compared with other methods, for different orbits (circular,\nelliptic, parabolic, including zoom-whirl).\n", "  We apply our method of indirect integration, described in Part I, at fourth\norder, to the radial fall affected by the self-force. The Mode-Sum\nregularisation is performed in the Regge-Wheeler gauge using the equivalence\nwith the harmonic gauge for this orbit. We consider also the motion subjected\nto a self-consistent and iterative correction determined by the self-force\nthrough osculating stretches of geodesics. The convergence of the results\nconfirms the validity of the integration method. This work complements and\njustifies the analysis and the results appeared in Int. J. Geom. Meth. Mod.\nPhys., 11, 1450090 (2014).\n", "  Spectroscopy of a $^{10}_{\\Lambda}$Be hypernucleus was carried out at JLab\nHall C using the $(e,e^{\\prime}K^{+})$ reaction. A new magnetic spectrometer\nsystem (SPL+HES+HKS), specifically designed for high resolution hypernuclear\nspectroscopy, was used to obtain an energy spectrum with a resolution of 0.78\nMeV (FWHM). The well-calibrated spectrometer system of the present experiment\nusing the $p(e,e^{\\prime}K^{+})\\Lambda,\\Sigma^{0}$ reactions allowed us to\ndetermine the energy levels, and the binding energy of the ground state peak\n(mixture of 1$^{-}$ and 2$^{-}$ states) was obtained to be\nB$_{\\Lambda}$=8.55$\\pm$0.07(stat.)$\\pm$0.11(sys.) MeV. The result indicates\nthat the ground state energy is shallower than that of an emulsion study by\nabout 0.5 MeV which provides valuable experimental information on charge\nsymmetry breaking effect in the $\\Lambda N$ interaction.\n", "  The complexity of quantum many-body systems originates from the interplay of\nstrong interactions, quantum statistics, and the large number of\nquantum-mechanical degrees of freedom. Probing these systems on a microscopic\nlevel with single-site resolution offers important insights. Here we report\nsite-resolved imaging of two-component fermionic Mott insulators, metals, and\nband insulators using ultracold atoms in a square lattice. For strong repulsive\ninteractions we observe two-dimensional Mott insulators containing over 400\natoms. For intermediate interactions, we observe a coexistence of phases. From\ncomparison to theory we find trap-averaged entropies per particle of\n$1.0\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}$. In the band-insulator we find local entropies as low as\n$0.5\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}$. Access to local observables will aid the understanding\nof fermionic many-body systems in regimes inaccessible by modern theoretical\nmethods.\n", "  We consider the consequences of global higher-spin symmetries in quantum\nfield theories on a fixed de Sitter background of spacetime dimension $D \\ge\n3$. These symmetries enhance the symmetry group associated with the isometries\nof the de Sitter background and thus strongly constrain the dynamics of the\ntheory. In particular, we consider the case when a higher spin charge acts\nlinearly on a scalar operator to leading order in a Fefferman-Graham expansion\nnear the future/past conformal boundaries. We show that this implies that the\nexpectation values of the operator inserted near the boundaries are\nasymptotically Gaussian. Thus, these operators have trivial cosmological\nspectra, and on global de Sitter these operators have only Gaussian\ncorrelations between operators inserted near future/past infinity. The latter\nresult may be interpreted as an analogue of the Coleman-Mandula theorem for\nQFTs on de Sitter spacetime.\n", "  Periodically driven (Floquet) crystals are described by their quasi-energy\nspectrum. Their topological properties are characterized by invariants attached\nto the gaps of this spectrum. In this article, we define such invariants in all\nspace dimensions, both in the case where no symmetry is present and in the case\nwhere the unitary chiral symmetry is present. When no symmetry is present, a\n$\\mathbb{Z}$-valued invariant can be defined in each gap in all even space\ndimensions. This invariant does not capture all the properties of a system\nwhere chiral symmetry is present. In even space dimension, chiral symmetry puts\nconstraints on its values in different gaps. In odd space dimension, chiral\nsymmetry also enables to define a $\\mathbb{Z}$-valued invariant, only in the\nchiral gaps $0$ and $\\pi$. We relate both gap invariants to the standard\ninvariants characterizing the quasi-energy bands of the system. Examples in one\nand three dimensions are discussed.\n", "  The quantization of two-dimensional Ho\\v{r}ava theory of gravity without the\nprojectability condition is considered. Our study of the Hamiltonian structure\nof the theory shows that there are two first-class and two second-class\nconstraints. Then, following Dirac we quantize the theory by first requiring\nthat the two second-class constraints be strongly equal to zero. This is\ncarried out by replacing the Poisson bracket by the Dirac bracket. The two\nfirst-class constraints give rise to the Wheeler-DeWitt equations, which yield\nuniquely a plane-wave solution for the wavefunction. We also study the\nclassical solutions of the theory and find that the characteristics of\nclassical spacetimes are encoded solely in the phase of the plane-wave solution\nin terms of the extrinsic curvature of the foliations $t =$Constant, where $t$\ndenotes the globally-defined time of the theory.\n", "  We consider a modified gravity plus single-scalar-field model, where the\nscalar Lagrangian couples symmetrically both to the standard Riemannian\nvolume-form (spacetime integration measure density) given by the square-root of\nthe determinant of the Riemannian metric, as well as to another non-Riemannian\nvolume-form in terms of an auxiliary maximal-rank antisymmetric tensor gauge\nfield. As shown in a previous paper, the pertinent scalar field dynamics\nprovides an exact unified description of both dark energy via dynamical\ngeneration of a cosmological constant, and dark matter as a \"dust\" fluid with\ngeodesic flow as a result of a hidden Noether symmetry. Here we extend the\ndiscussion by considering a non-trivial modification of the purely\ngravitational action in the form of f(R) = R - \\alpha R^2 generalized gravity.\nUpon deriving the corresponding \"Einstein-frame\" effective action of the latter\nmodified gravity-scalar-field theory we find explicit duality (in the sense of\nweak versus strong coupling) between the original model of unified dynamical\ndark energy and dust fluid dark matter, on one hand, and a specific quadratic\npurely kinetic \"k-essence\" gravity-matter model with special dependence of its\ncoupling constants on only two independent parameters, on the other hand. The\ncanonical Hamiltonian treatment and Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of the dual\npurely kinetic \"k-essence\" gravity-matter model is also briefly discussed.\n", "  An increasing fraction of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars is found as\ntheir iron abundance, [Fe/H], decreases below [Fe/H] = -2.0. The CEMP-s stars\nhave the highest absolute carbon abundances, [C/H], and are thought to owe\ntheir enrichment in carbon and the slow neutron-capture (s-process) elements to\nmass transfer from a former asymptotic giant-branch (AGB) binary companion. The\nmost Fe-poor CEMP stars are normally single, exhibit somewhat lower [C/H] than\nCEMP-s stars, but show no s-process element enhancement (CEMP-no stars). CNO\nabundance determinations offer clues to their formation sites. C, N, Sr, and Ba\nabundances (or limits) and 12C/13C ratios where possible are derived for a\nsample of 27 faint metal-poor stars for which the X-shooter spectra have\nsufficient S/N ratios. These moderate resolution, low S/N (~10-40) spectra\nprove sufficient to perform limited chemical tagging and enable assignment of\nthese stars into the CEMP sub-classes (CEMP-s and CEMP-no). According to the\nderived abundances, 17 of our sample stars are CEMP-s and three are CEMP-no,\nwhile the remaining seven are carbon-normal. For four CEMP stars, the\nsub-classification remains uncertain, and two of them may be pulsating AGB\nstars. The derived stellar abundances trace the formation processes and sites\nof our sample stars. The [C/N] abundance ratio is useful to identify stars with\nchemical compositions unaffected by internal mixing, and the [Sr/Ba] abundance\nratio allows us to distinguish between CEMP-s stars with AGB progenitors and\nthe CEMP-no stars. Suggested formation sites for the latter include faint\nsupernovae with mixing and fallback and/or primordial, rapidly-rotating,\nmassive stars (spinstars). X-shooter spectra have thus proved to be valuable\ntools in the continued search for their origin. Abridged.\n", "  We analyze the dynamics of Josephson vortex states in two-component\nBose-Einstein condensates with Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling by using\nthe Gross-Pitaevskii equation. In 1D, both in homogeneous and harmonically\ntrapped systems, we report on stationary states containing doubly charged,\nstatic Josephson vortices. In multidimensional systems, we find stable\nJosephson vortices in a regime of parameters typical of current experiments\nwith $^{87}$Rb atoms. In addition, we discuss the instability regime of\nJosephson vortices in disk-shaped condensates, where the snake instability\noperates and vortex dipoles emerge. We study the rich dynamics that they\nexhibit in different regimes of the spin-orbit coupled condensate depending on\nthe orientation of the Josephson vortices.\n", "  We show the equivalence between Fujikawa's method for calculating the scale\nanomaly and the diagrammatic approach to calculating the effective potential\nvia the background field method, for an $O(N)$ symmetric scalar field theory.\nFujikawa's method leads to a sum of terms, each one superficially in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with a vacuum diagram of the 1-loop expansion. From the\nviewpoint of the classical action, the anomaly results in a breakdown of the\nWard identities due to a scale-dependence of the couplings, whereas in terms of\nthe effective action, the anomaly is the result of the breakdown of Noether's\ntheorem due to explicit symmetry breaking terms of the effective potential.\n", "  We study the flavor changing neutral current couplings of new heavy quarks\nthrough the Z' models at the LHC. We calculate the cross sections for the\nsignal and the corresponding standard model background processes. Considering\nthe present limits on the mass of new heavy quarks and the Z' boson, we\nperformed an analysis to investigate the parameter space (mixing and mass)\nthrough different Z' models. For an FCNC mixing parameter x=0.1 and the Z' mass\nM_{Z'}=2000 GeV, and new heavy quark mass m_{t'}=700 GeV at the LHC with\n\\sqrt{s}=13 TeV, we find the cross section for single production of new heavy\nquarks associated with top quarks as 5.8 fb, 3.3 fb, 1.5 fb and 1.2 fb within\nthe Z'_{\\eta} , Z'_{\\psi} , Z'_{LP} and Z'_{\\chi} models, respectively. It is\nshown that the sensitivity would benefit from the flavor tagging.\n", "  New sets of parameters (\"tunes\") for the underlying-event (UE) modeling of\nthe PYTHIA8, PYTHIA6 and HERWIG++ Monte Carlo event generators are constructed\nusing different parton distribution functions. Combined fits to CMS UE\nproton-proton (pp) data at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV and to UE proton-antiproton (p\np-bar) data from the CDF experiment at lower sqrt(s), are used to study the UE\nmodels and constrain their parameters, providing thereby improved predictions\nfor proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV. In addition, it is investigated whether\nthe values of the parameters obtained from fits to UE observables are\nconsistent with the values determined from fitting observables sensitive to\ndouble-parton scattering processes. Finally, comparisons of the UE tunes to\n\"minimum bias\" (MB) events, multijet, and Drell-Yan (q q-bar to Z / gamma* to\nlepton-antilepton + jets) observables at 7 and 8 TeV are presented, as well as\npredictions for MB and UE observables at 13 TeV.\n", "  A Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machine (GRBM) is a Boltzmann machine defined\non a bipartite graph and is an extension of usual restricted Boltzmann\nmachines. A GRBM consists of two different layers: a visible layer composed of\ncontinuous visible variables and a hidden layer composed of discrete hidden\nvariables. In this paper, we derive two different inference algorithms for\nGRBMs based on the naive mean-field approximation (NMFA). One is an inference\nalgorithm for whole variables in a GRBM, and the other is an inference\nalgorithm for partial variables in a GBRBM. We compare the two methods\nanalytically and numerically and show that the latter method is better.\n", "  Removing outbursts from multiwavelength light curves of the blazar Mrk~421,\nwe construct outburstless time series for this system. A model-independent\npower spectrum light curve analysis in the optical, hard X-ray and gamma-rays\nfor this outburstless state and also the full light-curves, show clear evidence\nfor a periodicity of ~ 310 days across all wavelengths studied. A subsequent\nfull maximum likelihood analysis fitting an eclipse model confirms a\nperiodicity of 310 \\pm 1 days. The power spectrum of the signal in the\noutburstless state of the source does not follow a flicker noise behaviour and\nso, the system producing it is not self-organised. This and the fact that the\nperiodicity is better defined in the outburstless state, strongly suggests that\nit is not produced by any internal physical processes associated to the central\nengine. The simplest physical mechanism to which this periodicity could be\nascribed is a dynamical effect produced by an orbiting supermassive black hole\ncompanion eclipsing the central engine. Interestingly, the optimal eclipse\nmodel infers a brightness enhancement of (136.4 \\pm 20 )%, suggesting an\neclipse resulting in a gravitational lensing brightening. Consisting with this\ninterpretation, the eclipse occurs for only ( 9.7 \\pm 0.2)% of the orbital\nperiod.\n", "  Congruence theory has many applications in physical, social, biological and\ntechnological systems. Congruence arithmetic has been a fundamental tool for\ndata security and computer algebra. However, much less attention was devoted to\nthe topological features of congruence relations among natural numbers. Here,\nwe explore the congruence relations in the setting of a multiplex network and\nunveil some unique and outstanding properties of the multiplex congruence\nnetwork. Analytical results show that every layer therein is a sparse and\nheterogeneous subnetwork with a scale-free topology. Counterintuitively, every\nlayer has an extremely strong controllability in spite of its scale-free\nstructure that is usually difficult to control. Another amazing feature is that\nthe controllability is robust against targeted attacks to critical nodes but\nvulnerable to random failures, which also differs from normal scale-free\nnetworks. The multi-chain structure with a small number of chain roots arising\nfrom each layer accounts for the strong controllability and the abnormal\nfeature. The multiplex congruence network offers a graphical solution to the\nsimultaneous congruences problem, which may have implication in cryptography\nbased on simultaneous congruences. Our work also gains insight into the design\nof networks integrating advantages of both heterogeneous and homogeneous\nnetworks without inheriting their limitations.\n", "  This paper introduces a computationally inexpensive method of extracting the\nbackbone of one-mode networks projected from bipartite networks. We show that\nthe edge weights in the one-mode projections are distributed according to a\nPoisson binomial distribution and that finding the expected weight distribution\nof a one-mode network projected from a random bipartite network only requires\nknowledge of the bipartite degree distributions. Being able to extract the\nbackbone of a projection is highly beneficial in filtering out redundant\ninformation in large complex networks and narrowing down the information in the\none-mode projection to the most relevant. We demonstrate that the backbone of a\none-mode projection aids in the detection of communities.\n", "  We discuss quantized vortices in neutron $^3P_2$ superfluids, which are\nbelieved to realize in high density neutron matter such as neutron stars. By\nusing the Ginzburg-Landau free energy for $^3P_2$ superfluids, we determine the\nground state in the absence and presence of the external magnetic field, and\nnumerically construct $^3P_2$ quantized vortices in the absence and presence of\nthe external magnetic field along the vortex axis (poloidal) or angular\ndirection (toroidal). We find in certain situations the spontaneous\nmagnetization of the vortex core, whose typical magnitude is about $10^{7-8}$\nGauss, but the net magnetic field in a neutron star is negligible because of\nthe ratio of the vortex core size $\\sim 10$fm and the intervortex distance\n$\\sim 10^{-6}$m in a vortex lattice.\n", "  We infer dynamical masses in eight multi-planet systems using transit times\nmeasured from Kepler's complete dataset, including short-cadence data where\navailable. Of the eighteen dynamical masses that we infer, ten pass multiple\ntests for robustness. These are in systems; Kepler-26 (KOI-250), Kepler-29\n(KOI-738), Kepler-60 (KOI-2086), Kepler-105 (KOI-115), and Kepler-307\n(KOI-1576). Kepler-105 c has a density consistent with an Earth-like\ncomposition.\n  Strong TTV signals were detected from additional planets, but their inferred\nmasses were sensitive to outliers or consistent solutions could not be found\nwith independently-measured transit times, including planets at; Kepler-49\n(KOI-248), Kepler-57 (KOI-1270), Kepler-105 (KOI-115) and Kepler-177 (KOI-523).\nStrong upper limits on the mass of Kepler-177 c imply an extremely low density\n~0.1 g cm$^{-3}$.\n  In most cases, individual orbital eccentricities were poorly constrained due\nto degeneracies in TTV inversion. For five planet pairs in our sample, strong\nsecular interactions imply a moderate-to-high likelihood of apsidal alignment\nover a wide range of possible eccentricities. We also find solutions for the\nthree planets known to orbit Kepler-60 in a Laplace-like resonance chain.\nHowever, non-librating solutions also match the transit-timing data.\n  For six systems, we calculate more precise stellar parameters than previously\nknown, enabling useful constraints on planetary densities where we have robust\nmass measurements. Placing these exoplanets on the mass-radius diagram, we find\na wide range of densities is observed among sub-Neptune mass planets and that\nthe range in observed densities is anti-correlated with incident flux.\n", "  The existence of two motive forces on a Crookes radiometer has complicated\nthe investigation of either force independently. The thermal creep shear force\nin particular has been subject to differing interpretations of the direction in\nwhich it acts and its order of magnitude. In this article we provide a\nhorizontal vane radiometer design which isolates the thermal creep shear force.\nThe horizontal vane radiometer is explored through experiment, kinetic theory,\nand the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. The qualitative agreement\nbetween the three methods of investigation is good expect for a dependence of\nthe force on the width of the vane even when the temperature gradient is\nnarrower than the vane which is present in the DSMC method results but not in\nthe theory. The experimental results qualitatively resemble the theory in this\nregard. The quantitative agreement between the three methods of investigation\nis better than an order of magnitude in the cases examined. The theory is\ncloser to the experimental values for narrow vanes and the simulations are\ncloser to the experimental values for the wide vanes. We find that the thermal\ncreep force acts from the hot side to the cold side of the vane. We also find\nthe peak in the radiometer's angular speed as a function of pressure is\nexplained as much by the behavior of the drag force as by the behavior of the\nthermal creep force.\n", "  We obtain total galaxy X-ray luminosities, $L_X$, originating from\nindividually detected point sources in a sample of 47 galaxies in 15 compact\ngroups of galaxies (CGs). For the great majority of our galaxies, we find that\nthe detected point sources most likely are local to their associated galaxy,\nand are thus extragalactic X-ray binaries (XRBs) or nuclear active galactic\nnuclei (AGNs). For spiral and irregular galaxies, we find that, after\naccounting for AGNs and nuclear sources, most CG galaxies are either within the\n$\\pm1\\sigma$ scatter of the Mineo et al. (2012) $L_X$ - star formation rate\n(SFR) correlation or have higher $L_X$ than predicted by this correlation for\ntheir SFR. We discuss how these \"excesses\" may be due to low metallicities and\nhigh interaction levels. For elliptical and S0 galaxies, after accounting for\nAGNs and nuclear sources, most CG galaxies are consistent with the Boroson et\nal. (2011) $L_X$ - stellar mass correlation for low-mass XRBs, with larger\nscatter, likely due to residual effects such as AGN activity or hot gas.\nAssuming non-nuclear sources are low- or high-mass XRBs, we use appropriate XRB\nluminosity functions to estimate the probability that stochastic effects can\nlead to such extreme $L_X$ values. We find that, although stochastic effects do\nnot in general appear to be important, for some galaxies there is a significant\nprobability that high $L_X$ values can be observed due to strong XRB\nvariability.\n", "  We provide a statistical framework for characterizing stochastic particle\nproduction in the early universe via a precise correspondence to current\nconduction in wires with impurities. Our approach is particularly useful when\nthe microphysics is uncertain and the dynamics are complex, but only\ncoarse-grained information is of interest. We study scenarios with multiple\ninteracting fields and derive the evolution of the particle occupation numbers\nfrom a Fokker-Planck equation. At late times, the typical occupation numbers\ngrow exponentially which is the analog of Anderson localization for disordered\nwires. Some statistical features of the occupation numbers show hints of\nuniversality in the limit of a large number of interactions and/or a large\nnumber of fields. For test cases, excellent agreement is found between our\nanalytic results and numerical simulations.\n", "  To understand the anisotropy of flux pinning and critical current density in\ntechnological superconductors, the scaling law for the anisotropy of\nsingle-vortex collective pinning in uniaxial superconductors is extended to\nflux-bundle collective pinning in biaxial superconductors. The scaling results\nshow that in a system of random uncorrected point defects, the critical current\ndensity is described by a unified function with the magnetic field of the\nscaled isotropic superconductor. The obtained angular dependence of the\ncritical current density depicts the main features of experimental\nobservations, considering possible corrections due to the strong-pinning\ninteraction.\n", "  Low stability of organic-inorganic perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) solar cells in\nhumid air environments is a serious drawback which could limit practical\napplication of this material severely. In this study, from real-time\nspectroscopic ellipsometry characterization, the degradation mechanism of\nultra-smooth CH3NH3PbI3 layers prepared by a laser evaporation technique is\nstudied. We present evidence that the CH3NH3PbI3 degradation in humid air\nproceeds by two competing reactions of (i) the PbI2 formation by the desorption\nof CH3NH3I species and (ii) the generation of a CH3NH3PbI3 hydrate phase by H2O\nincorporation. In particular, rapid phase change occurs in the near-surface\nregion and the CH3NH3PbI3 layer thickness reduces rapidly in the initial 1-h\nair exposure even at a low relative humidity of 40%. After the prolonged air\nexposure, the CH3NH3PbI3 layer is converted completely to hexagonal platelet\nPbI2/hydrate crystals that have a distinct atomic-scale multilayer structure\nwith a period of 0.65 nm. We find that conventional x-ray diffraction and\noptical characterization in the visible region, used commonly in earlier works,\nare quite insensitive to the surface phase change. Based on results obtained in\nthis work, we discuss the degradation mechanism of CH3NH3PbI3 in humid air.\n", "  Following the recent development of a stable event-detection algorithm for\nhard-sphere systems, the implications of more complex interaction models are\nexamined. The relative location of particles leads to ambiguity when it is used\nto determine the interaction state of a particle in stepped potentials, such as\nthe square-well model. To correctly predict the next event in these systems,\nthe concept of an additional state that is tracked separately from the particle\nposition is introduced and integrated into the stable algorithm for event\ndetection.\n", "  The Weyl semimetal NbP was found to exhibit topological Fermi arcs and exotic\nmagneto-transport properties. Here, we report on magnetic quantum-oscillation\nmeasurements on NbP and construct the 3D Fermi surface with the help of\nband-structure calculations. We reveal a pair of spin-orbit-split electron\npockets at the Fermi energy and a similar pair of hole pockets, all of which\nare strongly anisotropic. The Fermi surface well explains the linear\nmagnetoresistance observed in high magnetic fields by the quantum-limit\nscenario. The Weyl points that are located in the $k_z \\approx \\pi/c$ plane are\nfound to exist 5 meV above the Fermi energy. Therefore, we predict that the\nchiral anomaly effect can be realized in NbP by electron doping to drive the\nFermi energy to the Weyl points.\n", "  A recent experiment driving colloids electromagnetically, by B\\'erut et al.\n[2014 Europhys. Lett. 107, 60004], is an ideal paradigm for illustrating a\nlinear response theory for nonequilibrium overdamped systems including\nhydrodynamic interactions and, unusually, a reservoir itself out of\nequilibrium. Indeed, in this setup one finds a nonequilibrium environment in\nwhich the mobility and diffusivity of free particles are not simply\nproportional to each other. We derive both the response to a mechanical forcing\nand to temperature variations in terms of correlations between an observable\nand a path-weight action. The time-antisymmetric component of the latter turns\nout not to be simply proportional to the heat flowing into the environment.\nThese results are visualized with simulations resembling conditions and\nprotocols easily realizable in the experiment, thereby tracing a path for\nexperimental verifications of the theory.\n", "  We calculate the effective macroscopic dielectric constant $\\varepsilon_a$ of\na periodic array of spherical nanocrystals (NCs) with dielectric constant\n$\\varepsilon$ immersed in the medium with dielectric constant $\\varepsilon_m\n\\ll \\varepsilon$. For an array of NCs with the diameter $d$ and the distance\n$D$ between their centers, which are separated by the small distance $s=D-d \\ll\nd$ or touch each other by small facets with radius $\\rho\\ll d$ what is\nequivalent to $s < 0$, $|s| \\ll d$ we derive two analytical asymptotics of the\nfunction $\\varepsilon_a(s)$ in the limit $\\varepsilon/\\varepsilon_m \\gg 1$.\nUsing the scaling hypothesis we interpolate between them near $s=0$ to obtain\nnew approximated function $\\varepsilon_a(s)$ for $\\varepsilon/\\varepsilon_m \\gg\n1$. It agrees with existing numerical calculations for\n$\\varepsilon/\\varepsilon_m =30$, while the standard mean-field Maxwell-Garnett\nand Bruggeman approximations fail to describe percolation-like behavior of\n$\\varepsilon_a(s)$ near $s = 0$. We also show that in this case the charging\nenergy $E_c$ of a single NC in an array of touching NCs has a non-trivial\nrelationship to $\\varepsilon_a $, namely $E_c = \\alpha e^2/\\varepsilon_a d$,\nwhere $\\alpha$ varies from 1.59 to 1.95 depending on the studied\nthree-dimensional lattices. Our approximation for $\\varepsilon_a(s)$ can be\nused instead of mean field Maxwell-Garnett and Bruggeman approximations to\ndescribe percolation like transitions near $s=0$ for other material\ncharacteristics of NC arrays, such as conductivity.\n", "  We consider inventions as novel combinations of existing technological\ncapabilities. Patent data allow us to explicitly identify such combinatorial\nprocesses in invention activities. Unconsidered in the previous research, not\nevery new combination is novel to the same extent. Some combinations are\nnaturally anticipated based on patent activities in the past or mere random\nchoices, and some appear to deviate exceptionally from existing invention\npathways. We calculate a relative likelihood that each pair of classification\ncodes is put together at random, and a deviation from the empirical observation\nso as to assess the overall novelty (or conventionality) that the patent brings\nforth at each year. An invention is considered as unconventional if a pair of\ncodes therein is unlikely to be used together given the statistics in the past.\nTemporal evolution of the distribution indicates that the patenting activities\nbecome more conventional with occasional cross-over combinations. Our analyses\nshow that patents introducing novelty on top of the conventional units would\nreceive higher citations, and hence have higher impact.\n", "  We examine the implication of the 750 GeV diphoton resonance on the\ntwo-Higgs-doublet model imposing various theoretical and experimental\nconstraints. The production rate of two-Higgs-doublet model is smaller than the\ncross section observed at the LHC by two order magnitude. In order to\naccommodate the 750 GeV diphoton resonance, we extend the two-Higgs-doublet\nmodel by introducing additional Higgs fields, and focus on two different\nextensions, an inert complex Higgs triplet and a real scalar septuplet. With\nthe 125 GeV Higgs being agreement with the observed data, the production rate\nfor the 750 GeV diphoton resonance can be enhanced to 0.6 fb for the former and\n4.5 fb for the latter. The results of the latter are well consistent with the\n750 GeV diphoton excess at the LHC.\n", "  The actual definition of the Nekrasov functions participating in the AGT\nrelations implies a peculiar choice of contours in the LMNS and Dotsenko-Fateev\nintegrals. Once made explicit and applied to the original triply-deformed\n(6-dimensional) version of these integrals, this approach reduces the AGT\nrelations to symmetry in q_{1,2,3}, which is just an elementary identity for an\nappropriate choice of the integration contour (which is, however, a little\nnon-traditional). We illustrate this idea with the simplest example of N=(1,1)\nU(1) SYM in six dimensions, however, all other cases can be evidently\nconsidered in a completely similar way.\n", "  We present a method to calibrate wavefront distortion of the spatial light\nmodulator setup by registering far field images of several Gaussian beams\ndiffracted off the modulator. The Fourier transform of resulting interference\nimages reveals phase differences between typically 5 movable points on the\nmodulator. Repeating this measurement yields wavefront surface. Next, the\namplitude efficiency is calibrated be registering near field image. As a\nverification we produced a superposition of 7th and 8th Bessel beams with\ndifferent phase velocities and observed their interference.\n", "  We demonstrate how conservation of longitudinal magnetization can have\npronounced effects on both stability and structure of vortices in the atomic\nspin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate by providing a systematic characterization of\nnonsingular and singular vortex states. Constructing spinor wave functions for\nvortex states that continuously connect ferromagnetic and polar phases we\nsystematically derive analytic models for nonrotating cores of different\nsingular vortices and for composite defect states with distinct small- and\nlarge-distance topology. We explain how the conservation law provides a\nstabilizing mechanism when the coreless vortex imprinted on the condensate\nrelaxes in the polar regime of interatomic interactions. The resulting\nstructure forms a composite defect: the inner ferromagnetic coreless vortex\ndeforms toward an outer singly quantized polar vortex. We also numerically show\nhow other even more complex hierarchies of vortex core topologies may be\nstabilized. Moreover, we analyze the structure of the coreless vortex also in a\nferromagnetic condensate, and show how reducing magnetization leads to a\ndisplacement of the vortex from the trap center and eventually to the\ndeformation and splitting of its core where a singular vortex becomes a\nlower-energy state. For the case of singular vortices, we find that the\nstability and the core structure are notably less influenced by the\nconservation of magnetization.\n", "  In the dilute limit Eshelby's inclusion theory captures the behavior of a\nwide range of systems and properties. However, because Eshelby's approach\nneglects interfacial stress, it breaks down in soft materials as the inclusion\nsize approaches the elastocapillarity length $L$. Here, we use a three-phase\ngeneralized self-consistent method to calculate the elastic moduli of\ncomposites comprised of an isotropic, linear-elastic compliant solid hosting a\nspatially random monodisperse distribution of spherical liquid droplets. As\nopposed to similar approaches, we explicitly capture the liquid-solid\ninterfacial stress when it is treated as an isotropic, strain-independent\nsurface tension. Within this framework, the composite stiffness depends solely\non the ratio of the elastocapillarity length $L$ to the inclusion radius $R$.\nIndependent of inclusion volume fraction, we find that the composite is\nstiffened by the inclusions whenever $R < 3L/2$. Over the same range of\nparameters, we compare our results with alternative approaches (dilute and\nMori-Tanaka theories that include surface tension). Our framework can be easily\nextended to calculate the composite properties of more general soft materials\nwhere surface tension plays a role.\n", "  We revisit the operation of the Stark decelerator and present a new,\noptimized operation scheme, which substantially improves the efficiency of the\ndecelerator at both low and high final velocities, relevant for trapping\nexperiments and collision experiments, respectively. Both experimental and\nsimulation results show that this new mode of operation outperforms the schemes\nwhich have hitherto been in use. This new mode of operation could potentially\nbe extended to other deceleration techniques.\n", "  Weyl fermions with tilted linear dispersions characterized by several\ndifferent velocities appear in some systems including the quasi-two-dimensional\norganic semiconductor $\\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ and three-dimensional\nWTe$_2$. The Coulomb interaction between electrons modifies the velocities in\nan essential way in the low-energy limit, where the logarithmic corrections\ndominate. Taking into account the coupling to both the transverse and\nlongitudinal electromagnetic fields, we derive the renormalization group\nequations for the velocities of the tilted Weyl fermions in two dimensions, and\nfound that they increase as the energy decreases and eventually hit the speed\nof light $c$ to result in the Cherenkov radiation. Especially, the system\nrestores the isotropic Weyl cone even when the bare Weyl cone is strongly\ntilted and the velocity of electrons becomes negative in certain directions.\n", "  We point out that Monte Carlo simulations of theories with severe sign\nproblems can be profitably performed over manifolds in complex space different\nfrom the one with fixed imaginary part of the action. We describe a family of\nsuch manifolds that interpolate between the tangent space at one critical\npoint, where the sign problem is milder compared to the real plane but in some\ncases still severe, and the union of relevant thimbles, where the sign problem\nis mild but a multimodal distribution function complicates the Monte Carlo\nsampling. We exemplify this approach using a simple 0 + 1 dimensional fermion\nmodel previously used on sign problem studies and show that it can solve the\nmodel for some parameter values where a solution using Lefshetz thimbles was\nelusive.\n", "  Results pertaining to numerical solutions of the Hasselmann kinetic equation\n(HE), for wind driven sea spectra, in the fetch limited geometry, are\npresented. Five versions of source functions, including the recently introduced\nZRP model, have been studied, for the exact expression of Snl and\nhigh-frequency implicit dissipation, due to wave-breaking. Four of the five\nexperiments were done in the absence of spectral peak dissipation for various\nSin terms. They demonstrated the dominance of quadruplet wave-wave interaction,\nin the energy balance, and the formation of self-similar regimes, of unlimited\nwave energy growth, along the fetch. Between them was the ZRP model, which\nstrongly agreed with dozens of field observations performed in the seas and\nlakes, since 1947. The fifth, the WAM3 wind input term experiment, used\nadditional spectral peak dissipation and reproduced the results of a previous,\nsimilar, numerical simulation, but only supported the field experiments for\nmoderate fetches, demonstrating a total energy saturation at half of that of\nthe Pierson-Moscowits limit. The alternative framework for HE numerical\nsimulation is proposed, along with a set of tests, allowing one to select\nphysically-justified source terms.\n", "  We show that a chain of nonmagnetic impurities deposited on a fully gapped\ntwo- or three-dimensional superconductor can become a topological\none-dimensional superconductor with protected Majorana bound states at its end.\nA prerequisite is that the pairing potential of the underlying superconductor\nbreaks the spin-rotation symmetry, as it is generically the case in systems\nwith strong spin-orbit coupling. We illustrate this mechanism for a spinless\ntriplet-superconductor p+ip and a time-reversal symmetric Rashba superconductor\nwith a mixture of singlet and triplet pairing. For the latter, we show that the\nimpurity chain can be topologically nontrivial even if the underlying\nsuperconductor is topologically trivial.\n", "  These lecture notes are intended to serve as an introduction to applied\nAdS/CFT with numerics for an audience of graduate students and others with\nlittle background in the subject. The presentation begins with a poor man's\nreview of current status of quantum gravity, where AdS/CFT correspondence is\nbelieved to be the well formulated quantum gravity in the anti-de Sitter space.\nThen we present the basic ingredients in applied AdS/CFT and introduce the\nrelevant numerics for solving differential equations into which the bulk\ndynamics collapses. To demonstrate how to apply AdS/CFT with numerics, we take\nthe zero temperature holographic superfluid as a concrete example for case\nstudy. In passing, we also present some new results, which include the\nnumerical evidence as well as an elegant analytic proof for the equality\nbetween the superfluid density and particle density, namely $\\rho_s=\\rho$, and\nthe saturation to the predicted value $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ by conformal field\ntheory for the sound speed in the large chemical potential limit.\n", "  We study in detail the strong-field QED process of non-linear Compton\nscattering in short intense plane wave laser pulses of circular polarization.\nOur main focus is placed on how the spectrum of the back-scattered laser light\ndepends on the shape and duration of the initial short intense pulse. Although\nthis pulse shape dependence is very complicated and highly non-linear, and has\nnever been addressed explicitly, our analysis reveals that all the dependence\non the laser pulse shape is contained in a class of three-parameter master\nintegrals. Here we present completely analytical expressions for the non-linear\nCompton spectrum in terms of these master integrals. Moreover, we analyse the\nuniversal behaviour of the shape of the spectrum for very high harmonic lines.\n", "  Boson condensation in topological quantum field theories (TQFT) has been\npreviously investigated through the formalism of Frobenius algebras and the use\nof vertex lifting coefficients. While general, this formalism is physically\nopaque and computationally arduous: analyses of TQFT condensation are\npractically performed on a case by case basis and for very simple theories\nonly, mostly not using the Frobenius algebra formalism. In this paper we\nprovide a new way of treating boson condensation that is computationally\nefficient. With a minimal set of physical assumptions, such as commutativity of\nlifting and the definition of confined particles, we can prove a number of\ntheorems linking Boson condensation in TQFT with chiral algebra extensions, and\nwith the factorization of completely positive matrices over the nonnegative\nintegers. We present numerically efficient ways of obtaining a condensed theory\nfusion algebra and S matrices; and we then use our formalism to prove several\ntheorems for the S and T matrices of simple current condensation and of\ntheories which upon condensation result in a low number of confined particles.\nWe also show that our formalism easily reproduces results existent in the\nmathematical literature such as the noncondensability of 5 and 10 layers of the\nFibonacci TQFT.\n", "  The rate of water flow through hydrophobic nanocapillaries is greatly\nenhanced as compared to that expected from macroscopic hydrodynamics. This\nphenomenon is usually described in terms of a relatively large slip length,\nwhich is in turn defined by such microscopic properties as the friction between\nwater and capillary surfaces, and the viscosity of water. We show that the\nviscosity of water and, therefore, its flow rate are profoundly affected by the\nlayered structure of confined water if the capillary size becomes less than 2\nnm. To this end we study the structure and dynamics of water confined between\ntwo parallel graphene layers using equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations.\nWe find that the shear viscosity is not only greatly enhanced for subnanometer\ncapillaries, but also exhibits large oscillations that originate from\ncommensurability between the capillary size and the size of water molecules.\nSuch oscillating behavior of viscosity and, consequently, the slip length\nshould be taken into account in designing and studying graphene-based and\nsimilar membranes for desalination and filtration.\n", "  We study the perturbative generation of higher-derivative operators as\ncorrections to the photon effective action, which are originated from a Lorentz\nviolation background. Such corrections are obtained, at one-loop order, through\nthe proper-time method, using the zeta function regularization. We focus over\nthe lowest order corrections and investigate their influence in the propagation\nof electromagnetic waves through the vacuum, in the presence of a strong,\nconstant magnetic field. This is a setting of experimental relevance, since it\nbases active efforts to measure non linear electromagnetic effects. After\nsurprising cancellations of Lorentz violating corrections to the Maxwell's\nequation, we show that no effects of the kind of Lorentz violation we consider\ncan be detected in such a context.\n", "  I summarize the state of the art of cross-section computations and of\navailable simulation tools for top-quark pair production in hadron collisions.\nParticular emphasis is put on recent theory developments relevant for LHC\nphenomenology.\n", "  It is well known that amorphous solids display a phonon spectrum where the\nDebye $\\sim \\omega^2$ law at low frequency melds into an anomalous excess-mode\npeak (the boson peak) before entering a quasi-localized regime at higher\nfrequencies dominated by scattering. The microscopic origin of the boson peak\nhas remained elusive despite various attempts to put it in a clear connection\nwith structural disorder at the atomic/molecular level. Using numerical\ncalculations on model systems, we show that the microscopic origin of the boson\npeak is directly controlled by the local breaking of center-inversion symmetry.\nIn particular, we find that both the boson peak and the nonaffine softening of\nthe material display a strong positive correlation with a new order parameter\ndescribing the local inversion symmetry of the lattice. The standard\nbond-orientational order parameter, instead, is shown to be a poor correlator\nand cannot explain the boson peak in randomly-cut crystals with perfect\nbond-orientational order. Our results bring a unifying understanding of the\nboson peak anomaly for model glasses and defective crystals in terms of a\nuniversal local symmetry-breaking principle of the lattice.\n", "  The ATLAS and CMS experiments at LHC observe small excesses of diphoton\nevents with invariant mass around 750 GeV. Here we study the possibility of\nnearly parity degenerate and vector-scalar degenerate spectra as well as\ncomposite dynamics in 2 scenarios for explaining the excess: Production of a\npseudo-scalar via gluon or photon fusion or via decay of a parent particle\ntogether with soft additional final states. We discuss possible underlying\nrealizations of the scenarios motivated by dynamical models of electroweak\nsymmetry breaking (without new coloured states) and fermion masses.\n", "  We report on an investigation of a method that applies simultaneously two\ndifferent mathematical models in order to optimize the design of a Zeeman\nSlower towards the implementation of ultra cold atoms in solid state physics.\nWe introduce the implementation of a finite element simulation that allows us\nto predict with great accuracy the magnetic field intensity profile generated\nby the proposed design. Through the prediction of the behavior of the Zeeman\nSlower a greater control is acquired, which allows the optimization of the\ndifferent experimental variables. We applied the method in the design of a\nmultilayer solenoidal \"Spin-Flip\" Zeeman Slower for strontium atoms. The\nmagnetic intensity profile generated by the Zeeman Slower is in agreement with\nthe magnetic field strength profile necessary for the atom cooling and tends to\nzero in both end sides. The latter terms are essential in order to optimize the\namount of trapped and cooled atoms.\n", "  The gravitational acceleration of antimatter, $\\bar{g}$, has never been\ndirectly measured and could bear importantly on our understanding of gravity,\nthe possible existence of a fifth force, and the nature and early history of\nthe universe. Three avenues appear feasible for such a measurement:\nantihydrogen, positronium, and muonium. The muonium measurement requires a\nnovel monoenergetic, low-velocity, horizontal muonium beam directed at an atom\ninterferometer. The precision three-grating interferometer can be produced in\nsilicon nitride or ultrananocrystalline diamond using state-of-the-art\nnanofabrication. The required precision alignment and calibration at the\npicometer level also appear to be feasible. With 100 nm grating pitch, a 10%\nmeasurement of $\\bar{g}$ can be made using some months of surface-muon beam\ntime, and a 1% or better measurement with a correspondingly larger exposure.\nThis could constitute the first gravitational measurement of leptonic matter,\nof 2nd-generation matter and, possibly, the first measurement of the\ngravitational acceleration of antimatter.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate that the spectral sensitivity of a Mach-Zehnder\n(MZ) interferometer can be enhanced through structural slow light. We observe a\n20 times enhancement by placing a dispersion-engineered-slow-light\nphotonic-crystal waveguide in one arm of a fibre-based MZ interferometer. The\nspectral sensitivity of the interferometer increases roughly linearly with the\ngroup index, and we have quantified the resolution in terms of the spectral\ndensity of interference fringes. These results show promise for the use of\nslow-light methods for developing novel tools for optical metrology and,\nspecifically, for compact high-resolution spectrometers.\n", "  We obtain a closed form effective potential at the one-loop level of a Two\nHiggs Doublet Model. Through the loop expansion we reproduce the expression\npresented by Weinberg and Coleman, showing explicitly every step involved in\nthe calculation. The formalism is then extended to include interaction terms\nbetween two scalar doublets and a final expression of the one-loop level\ncontributions is presented.\n", "  Multiferroic properties of orthorhombic HoMnO3 (Pbnm space group) are\nsignificantly modified by epitaxial compressive strain along the a-axis. We are\nable to focus on the effect of strain solely along the a-axis by using an YAlO3\n(010) substrate, which has only a small lattice mismatch with HoMnO3 along the\nother in-plane direction (the c-axis). Multiferroic properties of strained and\nrelaxed HoMnO3 thin films are compared with those reported for bulk, and are\nfound to differ widely. A relaxed film exhibits bulk-like properties such as a\nferroelectric transition temperature of 25 K and an incommensurate\nantiferromagnetic order below 39 K, with an ordering wave vector of (0 qb 0)\nwith qb ~ 0.41 at 10 K. A strained film becomes ferroelectric already at 37.5 K\nand has an incommensurate magnetic order with qb ~ 0.49 at 10 K.\n", "  The occurrence of first significant digits of numbers in large data is often\ngoverned by a logarithmically decreasing distribution called Benford's law\n(BL), reported first by S. Newcomb (SN) and many decades later independently by\nF. Benford (FB). Due to its counter-intuitiveness the law was ignored for\ndecades as a mere curious observation. However, an indication of its remarkable\nresurgence is the huge swell in the number of citations received by the papers\nof SN/FB. The law has come a long way, from obscurity to now being a regular\nsubject of books, peer reviewed papers, patents, blogs and news. Here, we use\nGoogle Scholar (GS) to collect the data on the number of citations received by\nthe articles citing the original paper of SN/FB and then investigate whether\nthe leading digits of this citations data are distributed according to the law\nthey discovered. We find that the citations data of literature on BL is in\nremarkable agreement with the predictions of the law.\n", "  Observer models were developed to process data in list-mode format in order\nto perform binary discrimination tasks for use in an arms-control-treaty\ncontext. Data used in this study was generated using GEANT4 Monte Carlo\nsimulations for photons using custom models of plutonium inspection objects and\na radiation imaging system. Observer model performance was evaluated and\npresented using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The\nideal observer was studied under both signal-known-exactly conditions and in\nthe presence of unknowns such as object orientation and absolute count-rate\nvariability; when these additional sources of randomness were present, their\nincorporation into the observer yielded superior performance.\n", "  The mechanisms of emission and changes in rotation frequency ('glitching') of\nthe Vela pulsar (J0835-4510) are not well understood. Further insight into\nthese mechanisms can be achieved by long-term studies of integrated pulse\nwidth, timing residuals, and bright pulse rates. We have undertaken an\nintensive observing campaign of Vela and collected over 6000 hours of single\npulse data. The data shows that the pulse width changes with time, including\nmarked jumps in width after micro-glitches (frequency changes). The abundance\nof bright pulses also changes after some micro-glitches, but not all. The\nsecular changes in pulse width have three possible cyclic periods, that match\nwith X-ray periodicities of a helical jet that are interpreted as free\nprecession.\n", "  Recent tests of a single module of the Jagiellonian Positron Emission\nTomography system (J-PET) consisting of 30 cm long plastic scintillator strips\nhave proven its applicability for the detection of annihilation quanta (0.511\nMeV) with a coincidence resolving time (CRT) of 0.266 ns. The achieved\nresolution is almost by a factor of two better with respect to the current\nTOF-PET detectors and it can still be improved since, as it is shown in this\narticle, the intrinsic limit of time resolution for the determination of time\nof the interaction of 0.511 MeV gamma quanta in plastic scintillators is much\nlower. As the major point of the article, a method allowing to record\ntimestamps of several photons, at two ends of the scintillator strip, by means\nof matrix of silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) is introduced. As a result of\nsimulations, conducted with the number of SiPM varying from 4 to 42, it is\nshown that the improvement of timing resolution saturates with the growing\nnumber of photomultipliers, and that the 2 x 5 configuration at two ends\nallowing to read twenty timestamps, constitutes an optimal solution. The\nconducted simulations accounted for the emission time distribution, photon\ntransport and absorption inside the scintillator, as well as quantum efficiency\nand transit time spread of photosensors, and were checked based on the\nexperimental results. Application of the 2 x 5 matrix of SiPM allows for\nachieving the coincidence resolving time in positron emission tomography of\n$\\approx$ 0.170 ns for 15 cm axial field-of-view (AFOV) and $\\approx$ 0.365 ns\nfor 100 cm AFOV. The results open perspectives for construction of a\ncost-effective TOF-PET scanner with significantly better TOF resolution and\nlarger AFOV with respect to the current TOF-PET modalities.\n", "  We report on self-induced switchings between multiple distinct space--time\npatterns in the dynamics of a spatially extended excitable system. These\nswitchings between low-amplitude oscillations, nonlinear waves, and extreme\nevents strongly resemble a random process, although the system is\ndeterministic. We show that a chaotic saddle -- which contains all the patterns\nas well as channel-like structures that mediate the transitions between them --\nis the backbone of such a pattern switching dynamics. Our analyses indicate\nthat essential ingredients for the observed phenomena are that the system\nbehaves like an inhomogeneous oscillatory medium that is capable of\nself-generating spatially localized excitations and that is dominated by\nshort-range connections but also features long-range connections. With our\nfindings, we present an alternative to the well-known ways to obtain\nself-induced pattern switching, namely noise-induced attractor hopping,\nheteroclinic orbits, and adaptation to an external signal. This alternative way\ncan be expected to improve our understanding of pattern switchings in spatially\nextended natural dynamical systems like the brain and the heart.\n", "  Analysis of transit times in exoplanetary systems accurately provides an\ninstantaneous orbital period, $P(t)$, of their member planets. A long-term\nmonitoring of those transiting planetary systems puts limits on the variability\nof $P(t)$, which are translated into the constraints on the time variation of\nthe gravitational constant $G$. We apply this analysis to $10$ transiting\nsystems observed by the Kepler spacecraft, and find that $\\Delta G/G\\lesssim\n5\\times10^{-6}$ for 2009-2013, or $\\dot{G}/G \\lesssim\n10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ if $\\dot{G}$ is constant. While the derived limit is\nweaker than those from other analyses, it is complementary to them and can be\nimproved by analyzing numerous transiting systems that are continuously\nmonitored.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) group-III-V honeycomb films have attracted significant\ninterest for their potential application in fields of quantum computing and\nnanoeletronics. Searching for 2D III-V films with high structural stability and\nlarge-gap are crucial for the realizations of dissipationless transport edge\nstates using quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect. Based on first-principles\ncalculations, we predict that the methyl-functionalized InBi monolayer\n(InBiCH3) has no dynamic instability, and host a QSH state with a band gap as\nlarge as 0.29 eV, exhibiting an interesting electronic behavior viable for\nroom-temperature applications. The topological characteristic is confirmed by\ns-pxy bands inversion, topological invariant Z2 number, and the time-reversal\nsymmetry protected helical edge states. Noticeably, the QSH states are tunable\nand robust against the mechanical strain, electric field and different levels\nof methyl coverages. We also find that InBiCH3 supported on h-BN substrate\nmaintains a nontrivial QSH state, which harbors the edge states lying within\nthe band gap of substrate. These findings demonstrate that the\nmethyl-functionalized III-V films may be a good QSH platform for device design\nand fabrication in spintronics.\n", "  We propose a mixture evolution scenario to model the evolution of the radio\nluminosity function (RLF) of steep spectrum AGNs (active galactic nuclei) based\non a Bayesian method. In this scenario, the shape of the RLF is determined by\nboth the density and luminosity evolution. Our models indicate that the density\nevolution is positive until a redshift of $\\thicksim 0.9$, at which point it\nbecomes negative, while the luminosity evolution is positive to a higher\nredshift ($z \\thicksim 5$ for model B and $z \\thicksim 3.5$ for model C), where\nit becomes negative. Our mixture evolution model works well, and the modeled\nRLFs are in good agreement with previous determinations. The mixture evolution\nscenario can naturally explain the luminosity-dependent evolution of the RLFs.\n", "  A strategy is a plan, method, or series of actions for obtaining a specified\ngoal. A military strategy typically employs the threat or use of military force\nin opposition to an adversary, and is called upon where large scale force is\nviewed as the way to achieve such goals. Strategic thinking is traditionally\nfocused on which part or combination of land, air, and naval forces is most\neffective. This may be too narrow an approach to accomplishing the ultimate\nend, which is generally political influence or control--or preventing influence\nor control by others--and almost never consists of physical destruction itself.\nIn order to broaden the discussion of military strategy, we consider here three\ndistinct effects of inflicting stress on an opponent: a) A fragile system is\ndamaged--possibly catastrophically, b) A robust system is largely unaffected,\nretaining much or all of its prior strength, c) Some systems actually gain\nstrength, a property which has recently been termed antifragility. Traditional\nperspectives of military strategy implicitly assume fragility, limiting their\nvalidity and resulting in surprise, and assume a specific end state rather than\nan overall condition of the system as a goal. Robustness and antifragility are\nrelevant both to offense and defense. While robustness and antifragility are\ndesirable in friendly systems, an enemy possessing these characteristics\nundermines the premise that an attack will achieve a desired increase in\ncontrol. Historical and contemporary examples demonstrate the failure of\ntraditional strategies against antifragile enemies--even devastating damage\ninflicted upon nations or other organizations did not weaken and defeat them,\nbut rather strengthened them, resulting in their victory. Underlying such\nsuccessful responses are socio-economic or political strengths. Our discussion\nis a basis for scientific analysis of improved strategic thinking.\n", "  A recent comparison of the evolution programs QCDNUM and APFEL showed a\ndiscrepancy in the time-like evolution of the singlet fragmentation function at\nNLO. It was found that the splitting functions of this evolution were wrongly\nassigned in QCDNUM, and also that the fragmentation functions were not\ncorrectly matched at the flavour thresholds. These errors are corrected in a\nnew release of the program.\n", "  We show that the electromagnetic forces generated by the excitations of a\nmode in graphene-based optomechanical systems are highly tunable by varying the\ngraphene chemical potential, and orders of magnitude stronger than usual\nnon-graphene-based devices, in both attractive and repulsive regimes. We\nanalyze coupled waveguides made of two parallel graphene sheets, either\nsuspended or supported by dielectric slabs, and study the interplay between the\nlight-induced force and the Casimir-Lifshitz interaction. These findings pave\nthe way to advanced possibilities of control and fast modulation for\noptomechanical devices and sensors at the nano- and micro-scales.\n", "  This artcile presents an optimisation of performance and cost of neutron\nscattering instrumentation at the European Spallation Source. This is done by\ntrading detailed cost functions against beam transmission functions in a\nmulti-dimensional, yet simple, parameter space. On the one hand, the neutron\nguide cost increases as a power of the desired beam divergence, and inversely\nwith the minimum wavelength, due to the supermirror coating needed. On the\nother hand, the more neutrons are transported to the instrument the greater are\nthe shielding costs to deal with the gamma rays that result from the eventual\nabsorption of the neutrons. There are additional factors in that many of the\nparameters defining the neutron guide geometry are continuous variables, and\nthe straightness of the guide increases the transmission of high energy\nspallation products, which affect the specifications of particularly heavy\nhardware, such as heavy shutters and additional shielding, beam stops etc. Over\nthe suite of 16 instruments, a maximum potential cost saving is identified in\nthe vicinity of 20 M\\euro \\,, with negligible penalties on instrument\nperformance and bandwidth, by trading minimum neutron wavelength $\\lambda$\nagainst total optical costs and shielding costs. Finally, these cost\ncalculations are shown to be consistent with those at real world, existing\nspallation source facilities.\n", "  Magnetic reconnection is a rapid energy release process that is believed to\nbe responsible for flares on the Sun and stars. Nevertheless, such\nflare-related reconnection is mostly detected to occur in the corona, while\nthere have been few studies concerning the reconnection in the chromosphere or\nphotosphere. Here we present both spectroscopic and imaging observations of\nmagnetic reconnection in the chromosphere leading to a microflare. During the\nflare peak time, chromospheric line profiles show significant\nblueshifted/redshifted components on the two sides of the flaring site,\ncorresponding to upflows and downflows with velocities of $\\pm$(70--80) km\ns$^{-1}$, comparable with the local Alfv\\'{e}n speed as expected by the\nreconnection in the chromosphere. The three-dimensional nonlinear force-free\nfield configuration further discloses twisted field lines (a flux rope) at a\nlow altitude, cospatial with the dark threads in He I 10830 \\r{A} images. The\ninstability of the flux rope may initiate the flare-related reconnection. These\nobservations provide clear evidence of magnetic reconnection in the\nchromosphere and show the similar mechanisms of a microflare to those of major\nflares.\n", "  The temperature dependences of g factors of underdoped YBa2Cu3O7-x (Tc\napproximates 86.5K) indicate that the pseudogap onset temperature T*(\napproximates 190 K) coincides with the phase boundary established by\nresistivity, Nernst effect, neutron diffraction and ultrasound measurements in\nYBCO phase diagram. The obtained empirical relationship between g factors and\npseudogap is appropriate for the entire charactering temperature range of\nOrtho-III YBCO. The EPR signals are ascribed to the localized Cu2+(1) sites\nbased on the quantitative calculations of the g factors by involving the local\nstructures of the paramagnetic copper (1) sites. The present work provides\nanother potential spectroscopic probe for the pseudogap in underdoped high Tc\nsuperconductors and the origin of EPR and related mechanisms in YBCO which are\nstill controversial.\n", "  In this work, we analyze the effects of thermal fluctuations on the\nthermodynamics of a modified Hayward black hole. These thermal fluctuations\nwill produce correction terms for various thermodynamic quantities like\nentropy, pressure, inner energy and specific heats. We also investigate the\neffect of these correction terms on the first law of thermodynamics. Finally,\nwe study the phase transition for the modified Hayward black hole. It is\ndemonstrated that the modified Hayward black hole is stable even after the\nthermal fluctuations are taken into account, as long as the event horizon is\nlarger than a certain critical value.\n", "  In this work, we study a biquadratic Heisenberg model with coupled orbital\ndegree of freedom using Monte Carlo simulation in order to investigate the\nphase transitions in iron-based superconductors. The antiferro-quadrupolar\nstate, which may be related to the magnetism of FeSe [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115,\n116401 (2015)], is stabilized by the anisotropic biquadratic interaction\ninduced by a ferro-orbital-ordered state. It is revealed that the orbital and\nnematic transitions occur at the same temperature for all the cases, supporting\nthe mechanism of the orbital-driven nematicity as revealed in most recent\nexperiments [Nat. Mater. 14, 210 (2015)]. In addition, it is suggested that the\norbital interaction may lead to the separation of the structural and magnetic\nphase transitions as observed in many families of iron pnictides.\n", "  How can effective barotropic matter emerge from the interaction of\ncosmological fluids in an isotropic and homogeneous cosmological model ?\n  The dynamics of homogeneous and isotropic\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker universes is a natural special case of\ngeneralized Lotka-Volterra systems where each of the universe's fluid\ncomponents can be seen as a competitive species in a predator-prey model.\n(Jungle universe : arXiv:1306.1037)\n  In addition to numerical simulations illustrating this behaviour among the\nbarotropic fluids filling the universe, we analytically pinpoint that effective\ntime-dependent barotropic indices can arise from a physical coupling between\nthose fluids whose dynamics could then look like that of another type of cosmic\nfluid, such as a cosmological constant.\n  Since the nature of dark energy is still unknown, this dynamical approach\ncould help understanding some of the properties of dark matter and dark energy\nat large cosmological scales.\n", "  We study the spin chain behavior, a transition to 3D magnetic order and the\nmagnitudes of the exchange interactions for the metal-amino acid complex\nCu(D,L-alanine)2.H2O, a model compound to investigate exchange couplings\nsupported by chemical paths characteristic of biomolecules. Thermal and\nmagnetic data were obtained as a function of temperature (T) and magnetic field\n(B0). The magnetic contribution to the specific heat, measured between 0.48 and\n30 K, displays above 1.8 K a 1D spin-chain behavior that can be fitted with an\nintrachain antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange coupling constant 2J0 = (-2.12\n$\\pm$ 0.08) cm$^{-1}$, between neighbor coppers at 4.49 {\\AA} along chains\nconnected by non-covalent and H-bonds. We also observe a narrow specific heat\npeak at 0.89 K indicating a phase transition to a 3D magnetically ordered\nphase. Magnetization curves at fixed T = 2, 4 and 7 K with B0 between 0 and 9\nT, and at T between 2 and 300 K with several fixed values of B0 were globally\nfitted by an intrachain AFM exchange coupling constant 2J0 = (-2.27 $\\pm$ 0.02)\ncm$^{-1}$ and g = 2.091 $\\pm$ 0.005. Interchain interactions J1 between coppers\nin neighbor chains connected through long chemical paths with total length of\n9.51 {\\AA} are estimated within the range 0.1 < |2J1| < 0.4 cm$^{-1}$, covering\nthe predictions of various approximations. We analyze the magnitudes of 2J0 and\n2J1 in terms of the structure of the corresponding chemical paths. The main\ncontribution in supporting the intrachain interaction is assigned to H-bonds\nwhile the interchain interactions are supported by paths containing H-bonds and\ncarboxylate bridges, with the role of the H-bonds being predominant. We compare\nthe obtained intrachain coupling with studies of compounds showing similar\nbehavior and discuss the validity of the approximations allowing to calculate\nthe interchain interactions.\n", "  A regularization procedure has been recently suggested for regularizing Big\nBang singularities in Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetimes. We\nargue that this procedure is only appliable to one case of Big Bang\nsingularities and does not affect other types of singularities.\n", "  It is shown that memory effects in experiments measuring correlations in\nentangled photon pairs are not able to produce a relevant loophole for the test\nof local hidden variables theories.\n", "  We use the published photometry and spectroscopy of 22 galaxies in the\nHerschel Reference Survey to determine that the value of the dust mass\nabsorption coefficient $\\kappa_{d}$ at a wavelength of 500 $\\mu m$ is\n$\\kappa_{500} = 0.051^{+0.070}_{-0.026}\\,{\\rm m^{2}\\,kg^{-1}}$. We do so by\ntaking advantage of the fact that the dust-to-metals ratio in the interstellar\nmedium of galaxies appears to be constant. We argue that our value for\n$\\kappa_{d}$ supersedes that of James et al. (2002) -- who pioneered this\napproach for determining $\\kappa_{d}$ -- because we take advantage of superior\ndata, and account for a number of significant systematic effects that they did\nnot consider. We comprehensively incorporate all methodological and\nobservational contributions to establish the uncertainty on our value, which\nrepresents a marked improvement on the oft-quoted 'order-of-magnitude'\nuncertainty on $\\kappa_{d}$. We find no evidence that the value of $\\kappa_{d}$\ndiffers significantly between galaxies, or that it correlates with any other\nmeasured or derived galaxy properties. We note, however, that the availability\nof data limits our sample to relatively massive\n($10^{9.7}<{M_{\\star}}<10^{11.0}\\ {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$), high metallicity\n($8.61<[12+{\\rm log}_{10}\\frac{O}{H}]<8.86$) galaxies; future work will allow\nus to investigate a wider range of systems.\n", "  A novel idea to control ion back-flow in time projection chambers is to use a\nmulti-layer extended gating grid to capture back-flowing ions at the expense of\nlive time and electron transparency. In this initial study, I perform\nsimulations of a four-layer grid for the ALICE and STAR time projection\nchambers, using $\\text{Ne}-\\text{CO}_{2}\\;(90-10)$ and\n$\\text{Ar}-\\text{CH}_{4}\\;(90-10)$ gas mixtures, respectively. I report the\nlive time and electron transparency for both 90% and 99% ion back-flow\nsuppression. Additionally, for the ALICE configuration I study several effects:\nusing a mesh vs. wire-plane grid, including a magnetic field, and varying the\nover-voltage distribution in the gating region. For 90% ion back-flow\nsuppression, I achieve 75% live time with 86% electron transparency for ALICE,\nand 95% live time with 83% electron transparency for STAR.\n", "  A chamber for direct detection of WIMPs with masses < 10 GeV/c2 and solar\naxions is developed. The chamber is filled with a gas mixture of H2 +3ppm TMAE\n(1,5,10 bar), or D2 + 3ppm TMAE. These gas fillings make it possible to\nsuppress an electron background. For detection of events, the system\nGEM+pin-anode with a multiplication coefficient of about 10E+05 is constructed.\n", "  The possibility to build a SiPM-readout muon detector (SiRO), using plastic\nscintillators with optical fibers as sensitive volume and readout by SiPM\nphoto-diodes, is investigated. SiRO shall be used for tracking cosmic muons\nbased on amplitude discrimination. The detector concept foresees a stack of 6\nactive layers, grouped in 3 sandwiches for determining the muon trajectories\nthrough 3 planes. After investigating the characteristics of the photodiodes,\ntests have been performed using two detection modules, each being composed from\na plastic scintillator sheet, $100 \\times 25 \\times 1\\,$cm$^{3}$, with 12\nparallel, equidistant ditches; each ditch filled with an optical fiber of\n$1.5\\,$mm thickness and always two fibers connected to form a channel. The\nattenuation of the light response along the optical fiber and across the\nchannels have been tested. The measurements of the incident muons based on the\ninput amplitude discrimination indicate that this procedure is not efficient\nand therefore not sufficient, as only about 30\\% of the measured events could\nbe used in the reconstruction of the muon trajectories. Based on the studies\npresented in this paper, the layout used for building the SiRO detector will be\nchanged as well as the analog acquisition technique will be replaced by a\ndigital one.\n", "  Test beam and irradiation facilities are the key enabling infrastructures for\nresearch in high energy physics (HEP) and astro-particles. In the last 11 years\nthe Beam-Test Facility (BTF) of the DA{\\Phi}NE accelerator complex in the\nFrascati laboratory has gained an important role in the European\ninfrastructures devoted to the development and testing of particle detectors.\nAt the same time the BTF operation has been largely shadowed, in terms of\nresources, by the running of the DA{\\Phi}NE electron-positron collider. The\npresent proposal is aimed at improving the present performance of the facility\nfrom two different points of view: extending the range of application for the\nLINAC beam extracted to the BTF lines, in particular in the (in some sense\nopposite) directions of hosting fundamental physics and providing electron\nirradiation also for industrial users; extending the life of the LINAC beyond\nor independently from its use as injector of the DA{\\Phi}NE collider, as it is\nalso a key element of the electron/positron beam facility. The main lines of\nthese two developments can be identified as: consolidation of the LINAC\ninfrastructure, in order to guarantee a stable operation in the longer term;\nupgrade of the LINAC energy, in order to increase the facility capability\n(especially for the almost unique extracted positron beam); doubling of the BTF\nbeam-lines, in order to cope with the signicant increase of users due to the\nmuch wider range of applications.\n", "  Today's best atomic clocks are limited by frequency noise on the lasers used\nto interrogate the atoms. A proposed solution to this problem is to create a\nsuperradiant laser using an optical clock transition as its gain medium. This\nlaser would act as an active atomic clock, and would be highly immune to the\nfluctuations in reference cavity length that limit today's best lasers. Here,\nwe demonstrate and characterize superradiant emission from the mHz linewidth\nclock transition in an ensemble of laser-cooled $^{87}$Sr atoms trapped within\na high-finesse optical cavity. We measure a collective enhancement of the\nemission rate into the cavity mode by a factor of more than 10,000 compared to\nindependently radiating atoms. We also demonstrate a method for seeding\nsuperradiant emission and observe interference between two independent\ntransitions lasing simultaneously. We use this interference to characterize the\nrelative spectral properties of the two lasing sub-ensembles.\n", "  Understanding how galaxies form in the early universe and their subsequent\nevolution through cosmic time is a major goal of modern astrophysics.\nPanchromatic look-back sky surveys significantly advanced the field in the past\ndecades, and we are now entering an even more fruitful period - a 'golden age'\nof radio astronomy - with upgraded, and new facilities delivering an order of\nmagnitude increase in sensitivity. An overview of recent developments in radio\ncontinuum sky surveys, focusing on the physical properties and cosmic evolution\nof radio AGN since z~5 is presented here.\n", "  OH megamasers (OHMs) are rare, luminous molecular masers that are typically\nobserved in (ultra) luminous infrared galaxies and serve as markers of major\ngalaxy mergers. In blind emission line surveys such as the Arecibo Legacy Fast\nArecibo L-Band Feed Array (ALFALFA) survey for neutral hydrogen (HI), OHMs at\nz~0.2 can mimic z~0.05 HI lines. We present the results of optical spectroscopy\nof ambiguous HI detections in the ALFALFA 40% data release detected by the Wide\nField Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) but with uncertain optical counterparts.\nThe optical redshifts, obtained from observations at the Apache Point\nObservatory, revealed five new OHMs and identified 129 HI optical counterparts.\nSixty candidates remain ambiguous. The new OHMs are the first detected in a\nblind spectral line survey.\n  The number of OHMs in ALFALFA is consistent with predictions from the OH\nluminosity function. Additionally, the mid-infrared magnitudes and colors of\nthe OHM host galaxies found in a blind survey do not seem to differ from those\nfound in previous targeted surveys. This validates the methods used in previous\nIR-selected OHM surveys and indicates there is no previously unknown\nOHM-producing population at z~0.2. We also provide a method for future surveys\nto separate OH megamasers from 99% of HI line emitters without optical\nspectroscopy by using WISE infrared colors and magnitudes. Since the fraction\nof OHMs found in flux-limited HI surveys is expected to increase with the\nsurvey's redshift, this selection method can be applied to future flux-limited\nhigh-redshift hydrogen surveys.\n", "  Gravity plays important roles in the evolution of molecular clouds. We\npresent an acceleration mapping method to estimate the acceleration induced by\ngravitational interactions in molecular clouds based on observational data. We\nfind that the geometry of a region has a significant impact on the behavior of\ngravity. In the Pipe nebula which can be approximated as a gas filament, we\nfind that gravitational acceleration can effectively compress the end of this\nfilament, which may have triggered star formation. We identify this as the\n\"gravitational focusing\" effect proposed by Burkert & Hartman (2004). In the\nsheet-like IC348-B3 region, gravity can lead to collapse at its edge, while in\nthe centrally condensed NGC1333 cluster-forming region gravity can drive\naccretion towards the center. In general, gravitational acceleration tends to\nbe enhanced in the localized regions around the ends of the filaments and the\nedges of sheet-like structures. Neglecting magnetic fields, these\n\"gravitational focusing\" and \"edge collapse\" effects can promote the formation\nof dense gas in a timescale that is much shorter than the global dynamical\ntime. Since the interstellar medium is in general structured, these edge\neffects should be prevalent.\n", "  With the laws of mass conservation, momentum conservation and energy\nconservation, incorporating the processes of neutral gas ionization and ion\ndiffusion, we develop a self-consistent model for the bright ribbon --- the\nmost prominent feature in Io's plasma torus. The model parameters are well\nconstrained by earlier {\\it in situ} observations with the Galileo and Voyager\nspacescrafts. Our model calculation indicates that the total power dissipated\ninside the torus is 3.6 times bigger than the total power transported to Jovian\nionosphere via Birkeland current. The power dissipation inside the torus is\nrelatively uniform. Most of the power transportation associated with the\nBirkeland current, however, is localized near the flux tube of Io. With a\nheight-intergrated conductivity of 0.15$\\,$mho in Jovian ionosphere, consistent\nwith earlier aeronomy models, the model gives a reasonable fit to the recent\nobservations of the FUV Io tail on Jupiter. Extra mass loading near Io is\nrequired in the model. This excess of mass injection into the plasma torus may\nexplain the Io-correlated energy source revealed by earlier EUV observations\nwith the Voyager spacecrafts. Further investigation of the model implications\nis warranted.\n", "  We propose a method to detect genuine quantum correlation for multi-qubit\npure states. We then derive a complementarity relations for pure quantum states\nof N qubits. We prove that in all many-qubit systems there exist strict\nmonogamy laws for quantum correlations. On the other hand, it is known that the\nentanglement monogamy equality proposed by Coffman, Kundu, and Wootters is in\ngeneral not true for multiqubit states. Inducing from the CKW equality, we find\na proper form of entanglement monogamy equality for arbitrary quantum states.\nThe total quantum correlation of qubit k with the remaining qubits Rk can be\ncharacterizes. Furthermore, the quantum correlation of qubit mn with the\nremaining qubits Rmn can also be obtained. Furthermore, some monogamy relations\nhave been obtained.\n", "  We present linear polarization observations of the exoplanet system HD 189733\nmade with the HIgh Precision Polarimetric Instrument (HIPPI) on the\nAnglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). The observations have higher precision than\nany previously reported for this object. They do not show the large amplitude\npolarization variations reported by Berdyugina et al. 2008 and Berdyugina et\nal. 2011. Our results are consistent with polarization data presented by\nWiktorowicz et al. 2015. A formal least squares fit of a Rayleigh-Lambert model\nyields a polarization amplitude of 29.4 +/- 15.6 parts-per-million. We observe\na background constant level of polarization of ~ 55-70 ppm, which is a little\nhigher than expected for interstellar polarization at the distance of HD\n189733.\n", "  Single photon sources are of paramount importance in quantum communication,\nquantum computation, and quantum metrology. In particular, there is great\ninterest to realize scalable solid state platforms that can emit triggered\nphotons on demand to achieve scalable nanophotonic networks. We report on a\nvisible-spectrum single photon emitter in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC). The emitter\nis photostable at room- and low-temperature enabling photon counts per second\n(cps) in excess of 2$\\times$10$^6$ from unpatterned, bulk SiC. It exists in two\northogonally polarized states, which have parallel absorption and emission\ndipole orientations. Low temperature measurements reveal a narrow zero phonon\nline (linewidth $<0.1~$nm) that accounts for $>30~$% of the total\nphotoluminescence spectrum.\n", "  In the paper by means of Fourier transform method and similarity method we\nsolve the Dirichlet problem for a multidimensional equation wich is a\ngeneralization of the Tricomi, Gellerstedt and Keldysh equations in the\nhalf-space, in which equation have elliptic type, with the boundary condition\non the boundary hyperplane where equation degenerates.The solution is presented\nin the form of an integral with a simple kernel which is an approximation to\nthe identity and self-similar solution of Tricomi-Keldysh type equation . In\nparticular, this formula contains a Poisson's formula, which gives the solution\nof the Dirichlet problem for the Laplace equation for the half-space. If the\ngiven boundary value is a generalized function of slow growth, the solution of\nthe Dirichlet problem can be written as a convolution of this function with the\nkernel (if a convolution exists).\n", "  We propose that the contrasting low-temperature behaviors observed\nexperimentally among isostructural and isoelectronic materials, like\nnon-superconducting and nonmagnetic MgFeGe, magnetically ordered NaFeAs, and\nsuperconducting LiFeAs, can be well understood from itinerant weak coupling\nlimit. We find that stronger $(\\pi,\\pi)$ instability appearing in the\nd$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital of NaFeAs is responsible for the occurrence of weak\nmagnetism while weaker but still prominent $(\\pi,\\pi)$ instability in LiFeAs\nleads to a superconducting state. In contrast, multiple competing instabilities\ncoexisting in orbital-resolved momentum-dependent susceptibilities, serving as\nmagnetic frustrations from itinerant electrons, may account for the nonmagnetic\nstate in MgFeGe, while poorer Fermi surface nesting leads to a\nnon-superconducting state. Based on above findings, we predict a possible way\nto make MgFeGe a new Fe-based superconductor.\n", "  We develop a theory for realizing frequency-independent, reflectionless,\nsingle-layer metafilms based on the Brewster effect. A metafilm designed based\non the theory is numerically analyzed using a finite-difference time-domain\nmethod. The numerical analysis demonstrates that the reflectance of the\nmetafilm vanishes independent of the frequency and that the metafilm behaves\nlike an all-pass filter (with finite loss). An analysis based on an electrical\ncircuit model of the reflectionless metafilm reveals that the energy of the\nsuppressed reflection wave is not stored in the metafilm but is radiated to the\ntransmission direction.\n", "  2$H$-TaSe$_2$ has been one of unique transition metal dichalcogenides\nexhibiting several phase transitions due to a delicate balance among competing\nelectronic ground states. An unusual metallic state at high-$T$ is sequentially\nfollowed by an incommensurate charge density wave (ICDW) state at $\\approx$ 122\nK and a commensurate charge density wave (CCDW) state at $\\approx$ 90 K, and\nsuperconductivity at $T_{\\rm{C}}\\sim$0.14 K. Upon systematic intercalation of\nPd ions into TaSe$_2$, we find that CCDW order is destabilized more rapidly\nthan ICDW to indicate a hidden quantum phase transition point at\n$x$$\\sim$0.09-0.10. Moreover, $T_{\\rm{C}}$ shows a dramatic enhancement up to\n3.3 K at $x$ = 0.08, $\\sim$24 times of $T_{\\rm{C}}$ in 2$H$-TaSe$_2$, in\nproportional to the density of states $N(E_F)$. Investigations of upper\ncritical fields $H_{c2}$ in single crystals reveal evidences of multiband\nsuperconductivity as temperature-dependent anisotropy factor $\\gamma_H$ =\n$H_{c2}^{ab}$/$H_{c2}^{c}$, quasi-linear increase of $H_{c2}^{c}(T)$, and an\nupward, positive-curvature in $H_{c2}^{ab}(T)$ near $T_{\\rm{C}}$. Furthermore,\nanalysis of temperature-dependent electronic specific heat corroborates the\npresence of multiple superconducting gaps. Based on above findings and\nelectronic phase diagram vs $x$, we propose that the increase of $N(E_F)$ and\neffective electron-phonon coupling in the vicinity of CDW quantum phase\ntransition should be a key to the large enhancement of $T_{\\rm{C}}$ in\nPd$_x$TaSe$_2$.\n", "  This study investigates unitary equivalent classes of one-dimensional quantum\nwalks. We prove that one-dimensional quantum walks are unitary equivalent to\nquantum walks of Ambainis type and that translation-invariant one-dimensional\nquantum walks are Szegedy walks. We also present a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for a one-dimensional quantum walk to be a Szegedy walk.\n", "  We use density functional theory based first-principles method to investigate\nthe bandstructure and phase stability in the laterally grown hexagonal\nC$_x$(BN)$_{1-x}$, two-dimensional Graphene and $h$-BN hybrid nanomaterials,\nwhich were synthesized by experimental groups recently (Liu $et al$, Nature\nNanotech, 8, 119 (2013)). Our detail electronic structure calculations on such\nmaterials, with both armchair and zigzag interfaces between the Graphene and $\nh$-BN domains, indicate that the band-gap decreases non-monotonically with the\nconcentration of Carbon. The calculated bandstructure shows the onset of Dirac\ncone like features near the band-gap at high Carbon concentration ($x \\sim\n0.8$). From the calculated energy of formation, the phase stability of\nC$_x$(BN)$_{1-x}$ was studied using a regular solution model and the system was\nfound to be in the ordered phase below a few thousand Kelvin. Furthermore,\nusing the Boltzmann transport theory we calculate the electrical resistivity\nfrom the bandstrcture of C$_x$(BN)$_{1-x}$ at different temperature ($T$),\nwhich shows a linear behaviour when plotted in the logarithmic scale against\n$T^{-1}$, as observed experimentally\n", "  Detuning of the fundamental is a way to enhance harmonic generation . By this\nmethod, the wiggler is composed of two segments in such a way that the\nfundamental resonance of the second segment to coincide with the third harmonic\nof the first segment of the wiggler to generate extreme ultraviolet radiation\nand x-ray emission. A set of coupled, nonlinear, and first-order differential\nequations in three dimensions describing the evolution of the electron\ntrajectories and the radiation field with warm beam is solved numerically by\nCYRUS 3D code in the steady-state for two models (1) seeded free electron laser\n(FEL) and (2) shot noise on the electron beam (self-amplified spontaneous\nemission FEL). Thermal effects in the form of longitudinal velocity spread is\nconsidered. Three-dimensional simulation describes self-consistently the\nlongitudinal spatial dependence of radiation waists, curvatures, and amplitudes\ntogether with the evaluation of the electron beam. The evolutions of the\ntransverse modes are investigated for the fundamental resonance and the third\nharmonic. Also, the effective modes of the third harmonic are studied. In this\npaper, we found that detuning of the fundamental with shot noise gives more\noptimistic result than the seeded FEL.\n", "  In this paper, we briefly discuss the dynamic and functional approach to\ncomputer symbolic tensor analysis. The ccgrg package for Wolfram\nLanguage/Mathematica is used to illustrate this approach. Some examples of\napplications are attached.\n", "  The primordial massive gravitational waves are placed in the squeezed vacuum\nstate and corresponding $BB$-mode correlation angular power spectrum of the\ncosmic microwave background is obtained for various slow roll inflation models.\nThe angular power spectrum is compared with the limit of BICEP2/Keck and Planck\njoint analysis data and the hybrid inflation model is found favorable.\n", "  A model of the steady-state operating, self-pumped singly resonant optical\nparametric oscillator (SPSRO) has been developed. The characteristics of quasi\nthree-level laser gain medium pumped longitudinally have been taken into\naccount. The characteristics of standing wave cavity, reabsorption losses,\nfocusing Gaussian beams of the pump laser, fundamental laser and signal wave\nhave been considered in the analyses. Furthermore, The power characteristics of\nthreshold and efficiency have been analyzed, employing a Yb3+-doped\nperiodically poled lithium niobate co-doped with MgO (Yb3+:MgO:PPLN) as the\nmedium of laser gain and second-order nonlinear crystal.\n", "  The framework of leading-order anisotropic hydrodynamics is supplemented with\nrealistic equation of state and self-consistent freeze-out prescription. The\nmodel is applied to central proton-nucleus collisions. The results are compared\nto those obtained within standard Israel-Stewart second-order viscous\nhydrodynamics. It is shown that the resulting hadron spectra are\nhighly-sensitive to the hydrodynamic approach that has been used.\n", "  In the present thesis I studied the phenomenology arising from a class of\nstring models called sequestered compactifications, which were born with the\naim of getting low-energy SUSY from strings. This is not an easy task if\ncombined with cosmological constraints, since the mechanism of moduli\nstabilization fixes both the scale of supersymmetric particles and the scale of\nmoduli, which tend to be of the same order. However, if on the one hand\nsupersymmetric particles with TeV mass are desired in order to address the\nhierarchy problem, on the other hand the cosmological moduli problem requires\nthe moduli to be heavier than 100 TeV. The specific setup of sequestered\ncompactifications makes this hierarchy achievable, at least in principle: as in\nthese models the visible sector is located on a stack of D3-branes at\nsingularities, a physical separation between the visible degrees of freedom and\nthe SUSY-breaking sources takes place. Such decoupling translates into a\nhierarchy between the scale of SUSY-breaking and the spectrum of supersymmetric\nparticles. Moreover, it is interesting to notice that moduli are the\nfour-dimensional manifestation of the existence of extra-dimensions, and then\ntheir presence is a common feature of all string compactifications. Since they\nare gravitationally coupled, they could decay late in the history of the\nuniverse, affecting in a significant way its cosmological evolution. Possible\ndeviations of the cosmological observables from the values predicted by the\nstandard Hot Big Bang Theory constitute an interesting alternative for the\ndiscovery of BSM physics, which is complementary to the particle physics\nsearch. For this reason in addition to SUSY-breaking in sequestered models, I\nalso studied several cosmological scenarios arising from them, such as\nproduction of non-thermal dark matter and dark radiation, reheating from moduli\ndecay and inflation.\n", "  This paper explores the possibility of determining the spin of the\nsupermassive black hole (SMBH) in Sgr A*, by using secondary images of stars\norbiting the SMBH. The photons propagate close to the SMBH and their\ntrajectories probe the space time in a region where the spin of the SMBH is\nimportant. We find the appearance of spikes in the secondary image, which\ndepends on the angular momentum and spin axis of the SMBH and study the\nspecific case of the star S2 in detail. The spikes has a magnitude of $\\sim 29$\nin the K-band and the required angular resolution is of order 15-20 $\\mu$as.\nThe combination of these two requirements poses an extreme observational\nchallenge, but might be possible with interferometric observations in the\nsub-mm regime. The next possible time frame for observing this effect on the\nstar S2 is in the late 2017 and then it repeats with the period of the star.\n", "  The paper is of scientific-methodical character. The classical soap film\nshape (minimal surface) problem is considered, the film being stretched between\ntwo parallel coaxial rings. An analytical approach based on relations to the\nSturm-Liouville problem is proposed. An energy terms interpretation of the\nclassical Goldschmidt condition is discussed. Appearance of the soliton\npotential in course of the second variation analysis is noticed.\n", "  We present angle-dependent measurements of the effective g-factor g* in a\nGe-Si core-shell nanowire quantum dot. g* is found to be maximum when the\nmagnetic field is pointing perpendicular to both the nanowire and the electric\nfield induced by local gates. Alignment of the magnetic field with the electric\nfield reduces g* significantly. g* is almost completely quenched when the\nmagnetic field is aligned with the nanowire axis. These findings confirm recent\ncalculations, where the obtained anisotropy is attributed to a Rashba-type\nspin-orbit interaction induced by heavy-hole light-hole mixing. In principle,\nthis facilitates manipulation of spin-orbit qubits by means of a continuous\nhigh-frequency electric field.\n", "  We study the typical collisional velocities in a polydisperse suspension of\ndroplets in two and three-dimensional turbulent flow and obtain precise\ntheoretical estimates of the dependence of the impact velocity of\nparticles-pairs on their relative sizes. These analytical results are validated\nagainst data from our direct numerical simulations. We show that the impact\nvelocity saturates exponentially with the inverse of the particle-size ratios.\nOur results are important to model coalescence or fragmentation (depending on\nthe impact velocities) and will be crucial, for example, in obtaining precise\ncoalescence kernels to describe the growth of water droplets which trigger rain\nin warm clouds.\n", "  We discuss the production of ultra high energy neutrinos coming from the\npropagation of ultra high energy cosmic rays and in the framework of top-down\nmodels for the production of these extremely energetic particles. We show the\nimportance of the detection of ultra high energy neutrinos that can be a\nfundamental diagnostic tool to solve the discrepancy in the observed chemical\ncomposition of ultra high energy cosmic rays and, at the extreme energies, can\nunveil new physics in connection with the recent cosmological observations of\nthe possible presence of tensor modes in the fluctuation pattern of the cosmic\nmicrowave background.\n", "  We present a method aimed at sampling charge density fluctuations in Coulomb\nsystems. The derivation follows from a functional integral representation of\nthe partition function in terms of charge density fluctuations. Starting from\nthe mean-field solution given by the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, an original\napproach is proposed to numerically sample fluctuations around it, through the\npropagation of a Langevin like stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE).\nThe diffusion tensor of the SPDE can be chosen so as to avoid the numerical\ncomplexity linked to long-range Coulomb interactions, effectively rendering the\ntheory completely local. A finite-volume implementation of the SPDE is\ndescribed, and the approach is illustrated with preliminary results on the\nstudy of a system made of two like-charge ions immersed in a bath of\ncounter-ions.\n", "  It has been known that discrete aurora suddenly intensifies and deforms from\nan arc-like to a variety of wavy/vortex structures, especially during a\nsubstorm period. The instability of Alfv$\\acute{\\rm e}$n waves reflected from\nthe ionosphere has been analyzed in order to comprehend the ignition process of\nauroral intensification. It was presented that the prime key is an enhancement\nof plasma convection, and the convection electric field has a threshold. This\nstudy examined effects of auroral electron precipitation, causing the\nionization of neutral atmosphere, on the linear instability of Alfv$\\acute{\\rm\ne}$n waves. It was found that the threshold of convection electric fields is\nsignificantly reduced by increasing the ionization rate, the realistic range of\nwhich could be estimated from observed electron energy spectra.\n", "  We analyze the elastic scattering of particles interacting with nuclei\nthrough vector and axial currents with overall couplings of the order of the\nStandard Model weak interaction, or smaller; the dominant contribution to the\nelastic cross section is identified as the coherent component and is therefore\nspin-independent. Differential and integrated cross sections are obtained for a\nwide range of incident particle masses and velocities and for nuclear targets\nwith different masses; vector, axial and overall couplings of the incident\nparticle and of the hadronic target to the massive exchanged boson are also\nkept general. This study naturally encompasses several kinds of possible dark\nmatter components, including active and sterile neutrinos or neutralinos, and\naddresses the prospects for their direct detection through elastic scattering\noff nuclei.\n", "  We perform an extension of the relation between the Nambu-Goto action and\nqubit theory. Of course, the Cayley hyperdeterminant is the key mathematical\ntool in such generalization. Using the Wick rotation we find that in four\ndimensions such a relation can be established no only in (2+2)-dimensions but\nalso in any signature. We generalize our result to a curved space-time of\n(2$^{2n}$+2$^{2n}$)-dimensions and (2$^{2n+1}$+2$^{2n+1}$)-dimensions.\n", "  I give in this brief tutorial a short practical introduction to the\nMathematica package SARAH. First, it is shown how an existing model file can be\nchanged to implement a new model in SARAH. In the second part, masses, vertices\nand renormalisation group equations are calculated with SARAH. Finally, the\nmain commands to generate model files and output for other tools are\nsummarised.\n", "  A peculiar radiation arising as a result of radiation interference of\nnonlinear oscillators excited by a monochromatic plane wave field of the\nincident particle is described. The radiation properties are determined by the\nfact that a phase of each oscillator radiation fields is synchronized by a wave\nfield, while the radiation itself occurs due to the particle field influence on\nthe oscillators. The consideration is performed for a thin film with negligible\ndensity effect. It is supposed that the contribution is given only by a\nlong-wave part of the Weizsacker spectrum for which nonlinear polarization\ncoefficients of medium are large.\n", "  The thermal history and internal structure of chondritic planetesimals,\nassembled before the giant impact phase of chaotic growth, potentially yield\nimportant implications for the final composition and evolution of terrestrial\nplanets. These parameters critically depend on the internal balance of heating\nversus cooling, which is mostly determined by the presence of short-lived\nradionuclides (SLRs), such as aluminum-26 and iron-60, as well as the heat\nconductivity of the material. The heating by SLRs depends on their initial\nabundances, the formation time of the planetesimal and its size. It has been\nargued that the cooling history is determined by the porosity of the granular\nmaterial, which undergoes dramatic changes via compaction processes and tends\nto decrease with time. In this study we assess the influence of these\nparameters on the thermo-mechanical evolution of young planetesimals with both\n2D and 3D simulations. Using the code family I2ELVIS/I3ELVIS we have run\nnumerous 2D and 3D numerical finite-difference fluid dynamic models with\nvarying planetesimal radius, formation time and initial porosity. Our results\nindicate that powdery materials lowered the threshold for melting and\nconvection in planetesimals, depending on the amount of SLRs present. A subset\nof planetesimals retained a powdery surface layer which lowered the thermal\nconductivity and hindered cooling. The effect of initial porosity was small,\nhowever, compared to those of planetesimal size and formation time, which\ndominated the thermo-mechanical evolution and were the primary factors for the\nonset of melting and differentiation. We comment on the implications of this\nwork concerning the structure and evolution of these planetesimals, as well as\ntheir behavior as possible building blocks of terrestrial planets.\n", "  The intermolecular interactions in the title compound are investigated using\nself-consistent charge density functional based tight binding molecular\ndynamics. Emphasis is put on the analysis of correlated motions of ion pairs\nusing ideas of network theory. At equilibrium such correlations are not very\npronounced on average. However, there exist sizeable local correlations for\ncases where two cations share the same anion via two NHO-hydrogen bonds. The\neffect of an external perturbation, which artificially introduces a sudden\nlocal heating of an NH-bond, is investigated using nonequilibrium molecular\ndynamics. Here, it is found that the average N-H bond vibrational relaxation\ntime is about 5.3 ~ps. This energy redistribution is rather nonspecific with\nrespect to the ion pairs and does not lead to long-range correlations spreading\nfrom the initially excited ion pair.\n", "  LOFAR is a new and sensitive radio interferometer that can be used for\ndynamic high-resolution imaging spectroscopy at low radio frequencies from 10\nto 90 and 110 to 250 MHz. Here we describe its usage for observations of the\nSun and in particular of solar radio bursts. We also describe the processing,\narchiving and accessing of solar LOFAR data, which is accomplished via the\nLOFAR Solar Imaging Pipeline and the LOFAR Solar Data Center.\n", "  This paper describes three conceptual areas in physics that are particularly\nimportant targets for educational interventions in K-12 science. These\nconceptual areas are force and motion, conservation of energy, and geometrical\noptics, which were prominent in the US national and four US state standards\nthat we examined. The four US state standards that were analyzed to explore the\nextent to which the K-12 science standards differ in different states were\nselected to include states in different geographic regions and of different\nsizes. The three conceptual areas that were common to all the four state\nstandards are conceptual building blocks for other science concepts covered in\nthe K-12 curriculum. Since these three areas have been found to be ripe with\ndeep student misconceptions that are resilient to conventional physics\ninstruction, the nature of difficulties in these areas is described in some\ndepth, along with pointers towards approaches that have met with some success\nin each conceptual area.\n", "  Understanding instructor attitudes and approaches to teaching quantum\nmechanics can be helpful in developing research-based learning tools. Here we\ndiscuss the findings from a survey in which 13 instructors reflected on issues\nrelated to quantum mechanics teaching. Topics included opinions about the goals\nof a quantum mechanics course, general challenges in teaching the subject,\nstudent preparation for the course, comparison between their own learning of\nquantum mechanics vs. how they teach it and the extent to which contemporary\ntopics are incorporated into the syllabus.\n", "  The harmonic lasing free-electron laser amplifier, in which two wigglers is\nemployed in order for the fundamental resonance of the second wiggler to\ncoincide with the third harmonic of the first wiggler to generate ultraviolet\nradiation, is studied. A set of coupled nonlinear first-order differential\nequations describing the nonlinear evolution of the system, for a long electron\nbunch, is solved numerically by CYRUS code. Solutions for the non-averaged and\naveraged equations are compared. Remarkable agreement is found between the\naveraged and non-averaged simulation for the evolution of the third harmonic.\nThermal effects in the form of longitudinal velocity spread are also\ninvestigated. For efficiency enhancement, the second wiggler field is set to\ndecrease linearly and nonlinearly at the point where the radiation of the third\nharmonic saturates. The optimum starting point and the slope of the tapering of\nthe amplitude of the wiggler are found by a successive run of the code. It is\nfound that tapering can increase the saturated power of the third harmonic\nconsiderably. In order to reduce the length of the wiggler, the prebunched\nelectron beam is considered.\n", "  Previously we discussed how well students in an introductory physics course\ndiagnosed their mistakes on a quiz problem with different levels of scaffolding\nsupport. In that case, the problem they self-diagnosed was unusually difficult.\nWe also discussed issues related to transfer, particularly the fact that the\ntransfer problem in the midterm that corresponded to the self-diagnosed problem\nwas a far transfer problem. Here, we discuss a related intervention in which we\nrepeated the study methodology with the same students in the same intervention\ngroups, using a new quiz problem which was more typical for these students and\na near transfer problem. We discuss how these changes affected students'\nability to self-diagnose and transfer from the self-diagnosed quiz problem to a\ntransfer problem on the midterm exam.\n", "  Nanoporous thin-films are an important class of materials, offering a way to\nobserve fundamental surface and bulk processes with particles larger than\nindividual atoms, but small enough to interact significantly with each other\nthrough mechanisms such as stress and surface mobility. In-Situ X-ray\nReflectivity and Grazing Incidence Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (GISAXS) were\nused to monitor thin-films grown from Tungsten Disilicide (WSi$_2$) and Copper\n(Cu) nanoclusters. The nanoclusters ranged in size from 2 nm to 6 nm diameter\nand were made by high-pressure magnetron sputtering via plasma-gas\ncondensation. X-Ray Reflectivity (XRR) measurements of the film at various\nstages of growth reveal that the resulting films exhibit very low density,\napproaching 15% of bulk density. This is consistent with a simple off-lattice\nballistic deposition model where particles stick at the point of first contact\nwithout further restructuring. Furthermore, there is little merging or\nsintering of the clusters in these films.\n", "  Because of the large energy separation between O-K and Mo-L$_{2,3}$ edges,\nextracting precise and reliable chemical information from core-loss EELS\nanalyze of molybdenum oxides has always been a challenge. In this regard\nMo-M$_{2,3}$ edges represents an interesting alternative as they are situated\nclose to the O-K edges. They should allow thus the extraction of a wealth of\nchemical information from the same spectra. However the main difficulty to\novercome in order to work properly with these edges is the delayed maxima of\nthe Mo-M$_{4,5}$ edges which hinders the automated background subtraction with\nthe usual inverse power low function. In this study we propose another\nbackground subtraction method specifically designed to overcome this obstacle\nand we apply it to the study of MoO3 and MoO2. We are able to show that\nquantitative chemical information can be precisely and accurately determined\nfrom the joined analyze of O-K and Mo-M$_{2,3}$ edges. In particular k-factors\nare derived as a function of the integration window width and standard errors\nclose to 2% are reported. The possibility to discriminate the two oxides thanks\nto chemical shifts and energy-loss near-edge structures is also investigated\nand discussed. Furthermore the M$_3$/M$_2$ ratios are derived and are found to\nbe strongly dependent on the local chemical environment. This result is\nconfirmed by multiplet calculations for which the crystal field parameters have\nbeen determined by ab initio calculations. The whole methodology as well as the\nconclusions presented in this paper should be easily transposable to any\ntransitions metal oxides of the 4d family. This work should open a new and\neasier way regarding the quantitative EELS analyses of these compounds.\n", "  We describe the version of the Temporal Variance Spectrum (TVS, Fullerton,\nGies & Bolton 1996) method with pre-smoothed line profile (smoothed Temporal\nVariance Spectrum, smTVS). This method introduced by Kholtygin et al. (2003)\ncan be used to detect the ultra weak variations of the line profile even for\nvery noisy stellar spectra. We also describe how to estimate the mode of the\nnon-radial pulsations (NRP) using the TVS and smTVS with different time spans.\nThe influence of the rotational modulation of the line profile on the TVS is\nconsidered. The analysis of the contribution of NRP and rotational modulation\nin the global TVS is studied.\n", "  The detachment of a semi-ordered monolayer of polystyrene microspheres\nadhered to an aluminum-coated glass substrate is studied using a laser-induced\nspallation technique. The microsphere-substrate adhesion force is estimated\nfrom substrate surface displacement measurements obtained using optical\ninterferometry, and a rigid-body model that accounts for the inertia of the\nmicrospheres. The estimated adhesion force is compared with estimates obtained\nfrom interferometric measurement of the out-of-plane microsphere contact\nresonance. Reasonable agreement is found between the two experiments. Scanning\nelectron microscope images of detached monolayer regions reveal a unique\nmorphology, namely, partially detached monolayer flakes composed of single\nhexagonal close packed crystalline domains. This work contributes to an\nimproved understanding of microsphere adhesion and demonstrates a unique\nmonolayer delamination morphology.\n", "  The minimum-effort coordination game, having potentially important\nimplications in both evolutionary biology and sociology, draws recently more\nattention for the fact that human behavior in this social dilemma is often\ninconsistent with the predictions of classic game theory. In the framework of\nclassic game theory, any common effort level is a strict and trembling hand\nperfect Nash equilibrium, so that no desideratum is provided for selecting\namong them. Behavior experiments, however, show that the effort levels employed\nby subjects are inversely related to the effort costs. Here, we combine\ncoalescence theory and evolutionary game theory to investigate this game in\nfinite populations. Both analytic results and individual-based simulations show\nthat effort costs play a key role in the evolution of contribution levels,\nwhich is in good agreement with those observed experimentally. Besides\nwell-mixed populations, set structured populations, where the population\nstructure itself is a consequence of the evolutionary process, have also been\ntaken into consideration. Therein we find that large number of sets and\nmoderate migration rate greatly promote effort levels, especially for high\neffort costs. Our results may provide theoretical explanations for coordination\nbehaviors observed in real life from an evolutionary perspective.\n", "  The data obtained by the LHC collaborations clearly show that supersymmetric\nmodels are not realized in nature in a vanilla form and that in particular\nstrongly interacting supersymmetric particles are most likely heavier than\nexpected. An exception are the partners of the third generation quarks, which\nalso play a dominant role in the breaking of the electroweak symmetry. We\nconsider here an extended class of so-called `natural supersymmetric models'\nwhere we allow for a sneutrino as the lightest supersymmetric particle as it\nappears for example in left-right symmetric models and/or models where\nsupersymmetry is explained via an inverse seesaw mechanism. We evaluate how\nmuch existing ATLAS data constrain such scenarios and obtain roughly a bound of\n300 GeV on the charginos if the sneutrinos are lighter than about 120 GeV. For\nthe stop we find that only masses up to 300 GeV are excluded independent of the\nmixing angle. For larger values the exclusion depends on the detail of the\nscenario and if the mass exceeds 800 GeV no bound is obtained.\n", "  Sensitivity to the square of the cutoff scale of quantum corrections of the\nHiggs boson mass self-energy has led many authors to conclude that the Higgs\ntheory suffers from a naturalness or fine-tuning problem. However, speculative\nnew physics ideas to solve this problem have not manifested themselves yet at\nhigh-energy colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. For this\nreason, the role of naturalness as a guide to theory model-building is being\nseverely questioned. Most attacks suggest that one should not resort to\narguments involving gravity, which is a much less understood quantum field\ntheory. Another line of attack is against the assumption that there exists a\nmultitude of additional heavy states specifically charged under the Standard\nModel gauge symmetries. Nevertheless, if we give ground on both of these\nassaults on naturalness, what remains is a naturalness concern over the\nprospect of numerous additional spin-zero scalar states in nature. The\nproliferation of heavy scalars generically destabilizes the Higgs boson mass,\nraising it to the highest and most remote scalar mass values in nature, thus\nstraining the legitimacy of the Standard Model. The copious use of extra\nscalars in theory model building, from explaining flavor physics to providing\nan inflationary potential and more, and the generic expectation of extra scalar\nbosons in nature argues for the proliferation instability problem being the\ncentral concern for naturalness of the Standard Model. Some approaches to\nsolving this problem are presented.\n", "  In the framework of linear optics, light fields do not interact with each\nother in a medium. Yet, when their field amplitude becomes comparable to the\nelectron binding energies of matter, the nonlinear motion of these electrons\nemits new dipole radiation whose amplitude, frequency and phase differ from the\nincoming fields. Such high fields are typically achieved with ultra-short,\nfemtosecond (1fs = 10-15 sec.) laser pulses containing very broad frequency\nspectra. Here, the matter not only couples incoming and outgoing fields but\nalso causes different spectral components to interact and mix through a\nconvolution process. In this contribution, we describe how frequency domain\nnonlinear optics overcomes the shortcomings arising from this convolution in\nconventional time domain nonlinear optics1. We generate light fields with\npreviously inaccessible properties because the uncontrolled coupling of\namplitudes and phases is turned off. For example, arbitrary phase functions are\ntransferred linearly to the second harmonic frequency while maintaining the\nexact shape of the input power spectrum squared.\n  This nonlinear control over output amplitudes and phases opens up new avenues\nfor applications based on manipulation of coherent light fields. One could\ninvestigate c.f. the effect of tailored nonlinear perturbations on the\nevolution of discrete eigenmodes in Anderson localization2. Our approach might\nalso open a new chapter for controlling electronic and vibrational couplings in\n2D-spectroscopy3 by the geometrical optical arrangement.\n", "  In the period 2012 June - 2013 October, the Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT)\nwent through the technical commissioning phase. The characterization involved\nthree first-light receivers, ranging in frequency between 300MHz and 26GHz,\nconnected to a Total Power back-end. It also tested and employed the telescope\nactive surface installed in the main reflector of the antenna. The instrument\nstatus and performance proved to be in good agreement with the expectations in\nterms of surface panels alignment (at present 300 um rms to be improved with\nmicrowave holography), gain (~0.6 K/Jy in the given frequency range), pointing\naccuracy (5 arcsec at 22 GHz) and overall single-dish operational capabilities.\nUnresolved issues include the commissioning of the receiver centered at 350\nMHz, which was compromised by several radio frequency interferences, and a\nlower-than-expected aperture efficiency for the 22-GHz receiver when pointing\nat low elevations. Nevertheless, the SRT, at present completing its\nAstronomical Validation phase, is positively approaching its opening to the\nscientific community.\n", "  We have identified iridium in an ~5 m-thick section of pelagic sediment cored\nin the deep sea floor at Site 886C, in addition to a distinct spike in iridium\nat the K-Pg boundary related to the Chicxulub asteroid impact. We distinguish\nthe contribution of the extraterrestrial matter in the sediments from those of\nthe terrestrial matter through a Co-Ir diagram, calling it the\n\"extraterrestrial index\" fEX. This new index reveals a broad iridium anomaly\naround the Chicxulub spike. Any mixtures of materials on the surface of the\nEarth cannot explain the broad iridium component. On the other hand, we find\nthat an encounter of the solar system with a giant molecular cloud can aptly\nexplain the component, especially if the molecular cloud has a size of ~100 pc\nand the central density of over 2000 protons/cm^3. Kataoka et al. (2013, 2014)\npointed that an encounter with a dark cloud would drive an environmental\ncatastrophe leading to mass extinction. Solid particles from the hypothesized\ndark cloud would combine with the global environment of Earth, remaining in the\nstratosphere for at least several months or years. With a sunshield effect\nestimated to be as large as -9.3 W m^-2, the dark cloud would have caused\nglobal climate cooling in the last 8 Myr of the Cretaceous period, consistent\nwith the variations of stable isotope ratios in oxygen (Barrera and Huber,\n1990; Li and Keller, 1998; Barrera and Savin, 1999; Li and Keller, 1999) and\nstrontium (Barrera and Huber, 1990; Ingram, 1995; Sugarman et al., 1995). The\nresulting growth of the continental ice sheet also resulted in a regression of\nthe sea level. The global cooling, which appears to be associated with a\ndecrease in the diversity of fossils, eventually led to the mass extinction at\nthe K-Pg boundary.\n", "  Plane Couette flow presents a regular oblique turbulent-laminar pattern over\na wide range of Reynolds numbers R between the globally stable base flow\nprofile at low R<R_g and a uniformly turbulent regime at sufficiently large\nR>R_t. The numerical simulations that we have performed on a pattern displaying\na wavelength modulation show a relaxation of that modulation in agreement with\nwhat one would expect from a standard approach in terms of dissipative\nstructures in extended geometry though the structuration develops on a\nturbulent background. Some consequences are discussed.\n", "  The exact analytical solutions of the Schr\\\"odinger equation for the\ngeneralized symmetrical Woods-Saxon potential are examined for the scattering,\nbound and quasi-bound states in one dimension. The reflection and transmission\ncoefficients are analytically obtained. Then, the correlations between the\npotential parameters and the reflection-transmission coefficients are\ninvestigated, and a transmission resonance condition is derived. Occurrence of\nthe transmission resonance has been shown when incident energy of the particle\nis equal to one of the resonance energies of the quasi-bound states.\n", "  Scattering of a 2D Dirac electrons on a rectangular matrix potential barrier\nis considered using the formalism of spinor transfer matrices. It is shown, in\nparticular, that in the absence of the mass term, the Klein tunneling is not\nnecessarily suppressed but occurs at oblique incidence. The formalism is\napplied to studying waveguiding modes of the barrier, which are supported by\nthe edge and bulk states. The condition of existence of the uni-directionality\nproperty is found. We show that the band of edge states is always finite with\nmassless excitations, while the spectrum of the bulk states, depending on\nparameters of the barrier, may consist of the infinite or finite band with\nboth, massive and massless, low-energy excitations. The effect of the Zeeman\nterm is considered and the condition of appearance of two distinct energy\ndependent directions corresponding to the Klein tunneling is found.\n", "  The dynamics of spatial coherence and momentum distribution of polaritons in\nthe regime of Bose-Einstein condensation are investigated in a GaAs microcavity\nwith embedded quantum wells under nonresonant excitation with picosecond laser\npulses. It is shown that the onset of the condensate first order sparial\ncoherence is accompanied by narrowing of the polariton momentum distribution.\nAt the same time, at sufficiently high excitation densities, there is\nsignificant qualitative discrepancy between the dynamic behavior of the width\nof the polariton momentum distribution determined from direct measurements and\nthat calculated from the coherence spatial distribution. This discrepancy is\nobserved at the fast initial stage of the polariton system kinetics and,\napparently, results from the strong spatial nonuniformity of the phase of the\ncondensate wave function, which equilibrates on a much longer time scale.\n", "  A review of the current challenges for the understanding of the physics of\nextragalactic radio jets from supermassive black holes is presented. Also, a\nprospect is given about how both very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) and\npolarimetric observations help us to understand their physics and the ones of\ntheir magnetic fields. This paper focuses on the impact that previous\nultra-high resolution polarimetric surveys have had on our current knowledge on\nradio loud AGN. It first concentrates on the expectations about the improvement\nthat the Square Kilometer Array, used as a super-sensitive VLBI station on\nexisting and future very long baseline interferometric arrays, will provide in\nterms of access to new source classes, and in terms of a deeper portion of the\nUniverse than currently accessible. A series of key new radio loud AGN science\nfields, to be opened by the Square Kilometer Array, are outlined together with\na collection of preliminary ideas about possible programs of interest to deep\nin such fields. The complementary aspects of future super-sensitive VLBI\nobservations as compared to deep continuum surveys with the Square Kilometer\nArray and its precursors are also outlined here.\n", "  We consider the parallel refractor problem when the planar radiating source\nlies in a medium having higher refractive index than the medium in which the\ntarget is located. We prove local $C^{1,\\alpha}$ estimates for parallel\nrefractors under suitable geometric assumptions on the source and target, and\nunder local regularity hypotheses on the target set. We also discuss existence\nof refractors under energy conservation assumptions.\n", "  Linear response theory relates the response of a system to the power-spectrum\nof its fluctuations. However, the response to external driving in realistic\nmodels exhibits a pronounced non-linear blurring of the spectral line-shape.\nConsidering a driven Bose-Hubbard trimer model we figure out what is the hidden\ntime scale that controls this smearing effect. Contrary to conventional wisdom,\nthe Fermi-golden-rule picture fails miserably in predicting the non-linear\nwidth of the transitions. Instead, if the system has a classical limit, the\ndetermination of the hidden time scale requires taking into account the\nunderlying classical phase-space dynamics.\n", "  Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are mainstay tools for assessing the\nlong-term interactions between climate and the economy and for deriving optimal\npolicy responses in the form of carbon prices. IAMs have been criticized for\ncontroversial discount rate assumptions, arbitrary climate damage functions,\nand the inadequate handling of potentially catastrophic climate outcomes. We\nreview these external shortcomings for prominent IAMs before turning our focus\non an internal modeling fallacy: the widespread misapplication of the Constant\nElasticity of Substitution (CES) function for the technology transitions\nmodeled by IAMs. Applying CES, an economic modeling approach, on technical\nfactor inputs over long periods where an entire factor (the greenhouse gas\nemitting fossil fuel inputs) must be substituted creates artifacts that fail to\nmatch the S-curve patterns observed historically. A policy critical result, the\nmonotonically increasing cost of carbon, a universal feature of IAMs, is called\ninto question by showing that it is unrealistic as it is an artifact of the\nmodeling approach and not representative of the technical substitutability\npotential nor of the expected cost of the technologies. We demonstrate this\nfirst through a simple but representative example of CES application on the\nenergy system and with a sectoral discussion of the actual fossil substitution\ncosts. We propose a methodological modification using dynamically varying\nelasticity of substitution as a plausible alternative to model the energy\ntransition in line with the historical observations and technical realities\nwithin the existing modeling systems. Nevertheless, a fundamentally different\napproach based on physical energy principles would be more appropriate.\n", "  These proceedings summarize the latest measurements on top production, top\nproperties and searches using the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The measurements\nare performed on $pp$ collision data with a center of mass energy $\\sqrt{s} =\n7, 8$ and $13$ TeV.\n", "  This note describes the solution of the Helmholtz equation inside a nanotorus\nwith uniform Dirichlet boundary conditions. The eigenfunction symmetry is\ndiscussed and the lower-order eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are shown. The\nsimilarity with the case of a long cylinder and with that of the vibrations of\na circular elastic membrane is discussed. This similarity is used to propose a\nclassification scheme of the eigenfunctions based on three indices.\n", "  Recent demonstrations of controlled switching between different ordered\nmacroscopic states by impulsive electromagnetic perturbations in complex\nmaterials have opened some fundamental questions on the mechanisms responsible\nfor such remarkable behavior. Here we experimentally address the question of\nwhether two-dimensional (2D) Mott physics can be responsible for unusual\nswitching between states of different electronic order in the layered\ndichalcogenide 1T-TaS2, or it is a result of subtle inter-layer orbitronic\nre-ordering of its helical stacking structure. We report on the switching\nproperties both in-plane and perpendicular to the layers by current-pulse\ninjection, the anisotropy of electronic transport in the commensurate ground\nstate, and relaxation properties of the switched metastable state. Contrary to\nrecent theoretical calculations, which predict a uni-directional metal\nperpendicular to the layers, we observe a large resistivity in this direction,\nwith a temperature-dependent anisotropy. Remarkably, large resistance ratios\nare observed in the memristive switching both in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane\n(OP). The relaxation dynamics of the metastable state for both IP and OP\nelectron transport are seemingly governed by the same mesoscopic quantum\nre-ordering process. We conclude that 1T-TaS2 shows resistance switching\narising from an interplay of both IP and OP correlations.\n", "  We present a model system for objects, climbers, which have the ability to\nmove as ASEP particles with non-uniform forward and backward jumping rate\ndynamics. These climbers are implemented as Mandal-Quan-Jarzynski [1] machines.\nClimbers on a number of neighboring columns are considered. The low entropy\nresource is provided abundantly to the first column, the unused part of this\nresource is consecutively passed over to objects in neighboring columns. This\nresults in a hierarchy among the lanes. The system displays interesting\nsteady-states. Both open and periodic boundary conditions are considered and\nresults from Monte Carlo simulations of the system will be reported.\n  [1] D. Mandal, H. T. Quan, and C. Jarzynski, Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 030602\n(2013)\n", "  Single photon sources based on spontaneous photon-pair generation have\nenabled pioneering experiments in quantum optics. However, their\nnon-determinism presents a bottleneck to scaling up photonic and hybrid\nquantum-enhanced technologies. Furthermore, photon pairs are typically emitted\ninto many correlated frequency modes, producing an undesirable mixed state on\nheralding. Here we present a complete fibre-integrated heralded single photon\nsource that addresses both these difficulties simultaneously. We use active\nswitching to provide a path to deterministic operation by multiplexing separate\nspontaneous sources, and dispersion engineering to minimise frequency\ncorrelation for high-purity single photon generation. All the essential\nelements -- nonlinear material with dispersion control, wavelength isolation,\noptical delay, and fast switching -- are incorporated in a low-loss\nalignment-free package that heralds photons in telecoms single-mode fibre. Our\nresults demonstrate a scalable approach to delivering pure single photons\ndirectly into guided-wave photonic devices.\n", "  It is generally assumed that on-off detectors with single-photon sensitivity\ncannot distinguish coherent states from phase-mixed coherent states without\nsome form of quadrature-based tomography. Here, we show that it is\ntheoretically possible to distinguish these states without quadrature-based\nmethods by comparing the vacuum probability of one output port of a variable\nbeam splitter (VBS) that has two different phase-mixed coherent states as its\ninputs to the well-known case of dual coherent-state inputs. As an application,\na method is proposed to test whether a laser field is in a coherent state over\na given time by simply measuring the VBS output populations with an on-off\nsingle-photon detector. Unfortunately, timing limitations of present technology\nprohibit such simple tests, but the technique may become practical in the\nfuture.\n", "  A method has been developed to solve three-particle Faddeev equations in the\nconfiguration space making use of a series expansion in hyperspherical\nharmonics. The following parameters of the bound state of triton and helium-3\nnuclei have been calculated: the binding energies, the weights of symmetric and\nmixed-symmetry components of the wave function, the magnetic moments, and the\ncharge radii.\n", "  This dissertation reports our investigation into the existence of anyons,\nwhich interpolate between bosons and fermions, in light of the Symmetrization\nPostulate, which states that only the two extremes exist. The Symmetrization\nPostulate can be understood as asserting that there are only two consistent\nways of combining the behavior of distinguishable particles to obtain the\nbehavior of identical ones. We showed that anyonic behavior then arises because\nof the way in which the probability amplitudes of distinguishable particles in\ntwo dimensions are affected by the topology of the space. These can then be\ncombined in one of the ways arising from the Symmetrization Postulate, to form\nidentical anyons. Therefore, anyons do not invalidate the Symmetrization\nPostulate, but are entirely compatible with it. In order to show that anyons\ncan arise without particle identity, we investigated how distinguishable\nparticles can gain particular properties from the topology of their\nconfiguration space. We managed to do so, and in the process, discovered a\nnovel approach for quantizing multiply-connected spaces, in a way that is more\nsuited to anyons than the standard approach.\n", "  In this paper we present a new discretization strategy for the boundary\nelement formulation of the Electroencephalography (EEG) forward problem.\nBoundary integral formulations, classically solved with the Boundary Element\nMethod (BEM), are widely used in high resolution EEG imaging because of their\nrecognized advantages in several real case scenarios. Unfortunately however, it\nis widely reported that the accuracy of standard BEM schemes is limited,\nespecially when the current source density is dipolar and its location\napproaches one of the brain boundary surfaces. This is a particularly limiting\nproblem given that during an high-resolution EEG imaging procedure, several EEG\nforward problem solutions are required for which the source currents are near\nor on top of a boundary surface.\n  This work will first present an analysis of standardly discretized EEG\nforward problems, reporting on a theoretical issue of some of the formulations\nthat have been used so far in the community. We report on the fact that several\nstandardly used discretizations requires the expansion term to be a square\nintegrable function. Instead, those techniques are not consistent when a more\nappropriate mapping is considered. Such a mapping allows the expansion function\nterm to be a less regular function, thus sensibly reducing the need for mesh\nrefinements and low-precisions handling strategies that are currently required.\nThese mappings, however, require a different and conforming discretization\nwhich must be suitably adapted to them. To do this we adopt a mixed\ndiscretization based on dual boundary elements residing on a suitably defined\ndual mesh. Finally we show how the resulting EEG problems has favorable\nproperties with respect to previously proposed schemes and we show their\napplicability to real case modeling scenarios obtained from MRI data.\n", "  An exact calculation of the local electric field ${\\bf E}({\\bf r})$ is\ndescribed for the case of a time dependent point electric dipole ${\\bf\np}e^{-i\\omega t}$ in the top layer of an $\\epsilon_2$, $\\epsilon_1$,\n$\\epsilon_2$ three parallel slabs composite structure, where the $\\epsilon_1$\nlayer has a finite thickness $2d$ but the $\\epsilon_2$ layers are infinitely\nthick. For this purpose we first calculate all the eigenstates of the full\nMaxwell equations for the case where $\\mu=1$ everywhere in the system. The\neigenvalues appear as special, non-physical values of $\\epsilon_1$ when\n$\\epsilon_2$ is given. These eigenstates are then used to develop an exact\nexpansion for the physical values of ${\\bf E}({\\bf r})$ in the system\ncharacterized by physical values of $\\epsilon_1(\\omega)$ and\n$\\epsilon_2(\\omega)$. Results are compared with those of a previous calculation\nof the local field of a time dependent point charge in the quasi-static regime.\nNumerical results are shown for the local electric field in practically\nimportant configurations where attaining an optical image with sub-wavelength\nresolution has practical significance.\n", "  In our previous paper we construct a renormalizable Wess-Zumino action on\nBFNC superspace at the second order approximation of noncommutative parameters.\nThe action contains about 200 terms which are necessary for renormalization. By\nremoving chiral covariant derivatives and chiral coordinates we found that the\nBFNC Wess-Zumino action can be transformed to a simpler form which have\nmanifest 1/2 supersymmetry. Based on this discovery, we can extend the BFNC\nWess-Zumino action to the all order of noncommutative parameters. At first we\nintroduce global symmetries, then obtain divergent operators in the effective\naction by using dimensional analysis, the next step is to construct all\npossible BFNC parameters, at the end we combine the BFNC parameters with the\ndivergent operators. We present the explicit action up to the fourth order of\nnoncommutative parameters. Because the action contain all possible divergent\noperators, it is renormalizable to all order in perturbative theory.\n", "  High quality WSe2 films have been grown on bilayer graphene (BLG) with\nlayer-by-layer control of thickness using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The\ncombination of angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES), scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), and optical absorption measurements reveal\nthe atomic and electronic structures evolution and optical response of\nWSe2/BLG. We observe that a bilayer of WSe2 is a direct bandgap semiconductor,\nwhen integrated in a BLG-based heterostructure, thus shifting the\ndirect-indirect band gap crossover to trilayer WSe2. In the monolayer limit,\nWSe2 shows a spin-splitting of 475 meV in the valence band at the K point, the\nlargest value observed among all the MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) materials. The\nexciton binding energy of monolayer-WSe2/BLG is found to be 0.21 eV, a value\nthat is orders of magnitude larger than that of conventional 3D semiconductors,\nyet small as compared to other 2D transition metal dichalcogennides (TMDCs)\nsemiconductors. Finally, our finding regarding the overall modification of the\nelectronic structure by an alkali metal surface electron doping opens a route\nto further control the electronic properties of TMDCs.\n", "  The pyrochlore Ho2Ge2O7 is a new highly correlated spin ice material.\nPhysical property measurements including x-ray diffraction, dc susceptibility\nand ac susceptibility, confirm that it shares the distinctive characteristics\nof other known spin ices. Polarized neutron scattering measurements on a powder\nsample, combined with reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) refinements, give unique\ninformation about the spin ice state in Ho2Ge2O7. RMC refinements are used to\nfit the powder magnetic diffuse scattering and predict the single crystal\nmagnetic scattering of Ho2Ge2O7, demonstrating consistency with spin ice\nbehavior.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to study the historical evolution of mathematical\nthinking and its spatial spreading. To do so, we have collected and integrated\ndata from different online academic datasets. In its final stage, the database\nincludes a large number (N~200K) of advisor-student relationships, with\naffiliations and keywords on their research topic, over several centuries, from\nthe 14th century until today. We focus on two different topics, the evolving\nimportance of countries and of the research disciplines over time. Moreover we\nstudy the database at three levels, its global statistics, the mesoscale\nnetworks connecting countries and disciplines, and the genealogical level.\n", "  Recurrence in the phase space of complex systems is a well-studied\nphenomenon, which has provided deep insights into the nonlinear dynamics of\nsuch systems. For dissipative systems, characteristics based on recurrence\nplots have recently attracted much interest for discriminating qualitatively\ndifferent types of dynamics in terms of measures of complexity, dynamical\ninvariants, or even structural characteristics of the underlying attractor's\ngeometry in phase space. Here, we demonstrate that the latter approach also\nprovides a corresponding distinction between different co-existing dynamical\nregimes of the standard map, a paradigmatic example of a low-dimensional\nconservative system. Specifically, we show that the recently developed approach\nof recurrence network analysis provides potentially useful geometric\ncharacteristics distinguishing between regular and chaotic orbits. We find that\nchaotic orbits in an intermittent laminar phase (commonly referred to as sticky\norbits) have a distinct geometric structure possibly differing in a subtle way\nfrom those of regular orbits, which is highlighted by different recurrence\nnetwork properties obtained from relatively short time series. Thus, this\napproach can help discriminating regular orbits from laminar phases of chaotic\nones, which presents a persistent challenge to many existing chaos detection\ntechniques.\n", "  We demonstrate that rectification ratios (RR) of >250 (>1000) at biases of\n0.5 V (1.2 V) are achievable at the two-molecule limit for donor-acceptor\nbilayers of pentacene on fullerene on Cu using scanning tunneling spectroscopy\nand microscopy. Using first-principles calculations, we show that the system\nbehaves as a molecular Schottky diode with a tunneling transport mechanism from\nsemiconducting pentacene to Cu-hybridized metallic fullerene. Low-bias RRs vary\nby two orders-of-magnitude at the edge of these molecular heterojunctions due\nto increased Stark shifts and confinement effects.\n", "  This paper attempts to address the question that whether the present physical\nor mathematical theories are sufficient to understand the complexities of human\nbrain when it interacts with the external environment in the form of an\nauditory stimulus.There have been efforts reporting that the introduction of\nambiguity in visual stimuli causes effects which can't be explained\nclassically.In this paper,it is investigated whether ambiguity in auditory\nstimuli can introduce any non-classical effects in human brain.Simple\nexperiments were performed on normal subjects where they listened to an\nambiguous auditory signal and responded to a question with 'yes' or 'no'.The\noutcome of the test showed that the classical formula of total probability does\nnot hold true in this case.Results were interesting and indicate that there is\na definite non-classicality in mental states in perception of ambiguous audio\nstimuli.\n", "  We present the first calculation of the cross-correlation between\nthree-dimensional cosmic shear and the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (iSW) effect.\nBoth signals are combined in a single formalism, which permits the computation\nof the full covariance matrix. In order to avoid the uncertainties presented by\nthe non-linear evolution of the matter power spectrum and intrinsic alignments\nof galaxies, our analysis is restricted to large scales, i.e. multipoles below\nl=1000. We demonstrate in a Fisher analysis that this reduction compared to\nother studies of three-dimensional weak lensing extending to smaller scales is\ncompensated by the information that is gained if the additional iSW signal and\nin particular its cross-correlation with lensing data are considered. Given the\nobservational standards of upcoming weak lensing surveys like Euclid, marginal\nerrors on cosmological parameters decrease by ten per cent compared to a cosmic\nshear experiment if both types of information are combined without a CMB prior.\nOnce the constraining power of CMB data is added, the improvement becomes\nmarginal.\n", "  The present work reports the study of the optimized processing conditions of\nBi0.9La0.1Fe0.9Mn0.1O3 thin films, grown by RF sputtering on platinum metalized\nsilicon substrates. The combination of deposition at relatively low substrate\ntemperature followed by adequate ex situ annealing leads to thin films with\nsmooth surface morphology and the formation of a high-quality monophasic layer,\nwith the (100)c preferable orientation. The annealed films show ferroelectric\nimprint.\n", "  The light cone gauge is used frequently in string theory as well as gauge\ntheories and gravitation. Loop integrals however have to be infrared regulated\nto remove spurious poles. The most popular and consistent of these infrared\nregulators is the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt(ML) prescription. The calculations with\nML are rather cumbersome, though. In this work we show that the ML can be\nreplaced by a symmetry of the regulator. This symmetry simplify the\ncalculations, reducing them to conventional dimensional regularization\nintegrals.\n", "  The following is a report on an experimental technique allowing to quantify\nand map the velocity field with a very high resolution and a simple equipment\nin large 2D devices. A simple Shlieren technique is proposed to reinforce the\ncontrast in the images and allow you to detect seeded particles that are\npixel-sized or even inferior to it. The velocimetry technique that we have\nreported on is based on auto-correlation functions of the pixel intensity,\nwhich we have shown are directly related to the magnitude of the local average\nvelocity. The characteristic time involved in the decorrelation of the signal\nis proportional to the tracer size and inversely proportional to the average\nvelocity. We have reported on a detailed discussion about the optimization of\nrelevant involved parameters, the spatial resolution and the accuracy of the\nmethod. The technique is then applied to a model porous media made of a random\nchannel network. We show that it is highly efficient to determine the magnitude\nof the flow in each of the channels of the network, opening the road to the\nfundamental study of the flows of complex fluids. The latter is illustrated\nwith yield stress fluid, in which the flow becomes highly heterogeneous at\nsmall flow rates.\n", "  Very Small Angle Neutron Scattering (VSANS) is an upgrade of the traditional\nSmall Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) technique which can cover three orders of\nmagnitude of length scale from one nanometer to one micrometer. It is a\npowerful tool for structure calibration in polymer science, biology, material\nscience and condensed matter physics. Since the first VSANS instrument, D11 in\nGrenoble, was built in 1972, new collimation techniques, focusing optics\n(multi-beam converging apertures, material or magnetic lenses, and focusing\nmirrors) and higher resolution detectors combined with the long flight paths\nand long incident neutron wavelengths have been developed. In this paper, a\ndetailed review is given of the development, principles and application\nconditions of various VSANS techniques. Then, beam current gain factors are\ncalculated to evaluate those techniques. A VSANS design for the China\nSpallation Neutron Source (CSNS) is thereby presented.\n", "  In many large systems, such as those encountered in biology or economics, the\ndynamics are nonlinear and are only known very coarsely. It is often the case,\nhowever, that the signs (excitation or inhibition) of individual interactions\nare known. This paper extends to nonlinear systems the classical criteria of\nlinear sign stability introduced in the 70's, yielding simple sufficient\nconditions to determine stability using only the sign patterns of the\ninteractions.\n", "  (abridged abstract) Theoretical arguments indicate that close-in terrestial\nexoplanets may have weak magnetic fields. As described in the companion article\n(Paper I), a weak magnetic field results in a high flux of galactic cosmic rays\nto the top of the planetary atmosphere. We investigate effects that may result\nfrom a high flux of galactic cosmic rays both throughout the atmosphere and at\nthe planetary surface. Using an air shower approach, we calculate how the\natmospheric chemistry and temperature change under the influence of galactic\ncosmic rays for Earth-like (N_2-O_2 dominated) atmospheres. We evaluate the\nproduction and destruction rate of atmospheric biosignature molecules. We\nderive planetary emission and transmission spectra to study the influence of\ngalactic cosmic rays on biosignature detectability. We then calculate the\nresulting surface UV flux, the surface particle flux, and the associated\nequivalent biological dose rates. We find that up to 20% of stratospheric ozone\nis destroyed by cosmic-ray protons. The reduction of the planetary ozone layer\nleads to an increase in the weighted surface UV flux by two orders of magnitude\nunder stellar UV flare conditions. The resulting biological effective dose rate\nis, however, too low to strongly affect surface life. We also examine the\nsurface particle flux: For a planet with a terrestrial atmosphere, a reduction\nof the magnetic shielding efficiency can increase the biological radiation dose\nrate by a factor of two. For a planet with a weaker atmosphere (with a surface\npressure of 97.8 hPa), the planetary magnetic field has a much stronger\ninfluence on the biological radiation dose, changing it by up to two orders of\nmagnitude.\n", "  The frequency estimation from the Koopman eigenvalues (phase angles) obtained\nvia Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is addressed. Since the calculations of\nthe frequencies from the phase angles are nonunique, the modifications of DMD\nfor uniqueness restoration are considered. The nonlinear oscillating mode of\nsupersonic jet, impinging the flat plate, is used as a toy problem.\n", "  Experimental evidence for the possible universality classes of the\nmetal-insulator transition (MIT) in two dimensions (2D) is discussed.\nSufficiently strong disorder, in particular, changes the nature of the\ntransition. Comprehensive studies of the charge dynamics are also reviewed,\ndescribing evidence that the MIT in a 2D electron system in silicon should be\nviewed as the melting of the Coulomb glass. Comparisons are made to recent\nresults on novel 2D materials and quasi-2D strongly correlated systems, such as\ncuprates.\n", "  Inspired by the LG/CY correspondence, we study the local index theory of the\nSchr\\\"odinger operator associated to a singularity defined on ${\\mathbb C}^n$\nby a quasi-homogeneous polynomial $f$. Under some mild assumption on $f$, we\nshow that the small time heat kernel expansion of the corresponding\nSchr\\\"odinger operator exists and is a series of fractional powers of time $t$.\nThen we prove a local index formula which expresses the Milnor number of $f$ by\na Gaussian type integral. Furthermore, the heat kernel expansion provides\nspectral invariants of $f$. Especially, we define torsion type invariants\nassociated to a singularity. These spectral invariants provide a new direction\nto study the singularity.\n", "  We have been developing monolithic active pixel sensors series, named\n\"XRPIX,\" based on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) pixel technology, for future\nX-ray astronomical satellites. The XRPIX series offers high coincidence time\nresolution ({\\rm \\sim}1 {\\rm \\mu}s), superior readout time ({\\rm \\sim}10 {\\rm\n\\mu}s), and a wide energy range (0.5--40 keV). In the previous study, we\nsuccessfully demonstrated X-ray detection by event-driven readout of XRPIX2b.\nWe here report recent improvements in spectroscopic performance. We\nsuccessfully increased the gain and reduced the readout noise in XRPIX2b by\ndecreasing the parasitic capacitance of the sense-node originated in the buried\np-well (BPW). On the other hand, we found significant tail structures in the\nspectral response due to the loss of the charge collection efficiency when a\nsmall BPW is employed. Thus, we increased the gain in XRPIX3b by introducing\nin-pixel charge sensitive amplifiers instead of having even smaller BPW. We\nfinally achieved the readout noise of 35 e{\\rm ^{-}} (rms) and the energy\nresolution of 320 eV (FWHM) at 6 keV without significant loss of the charge\ncollection efficiency.\n", "  James L. Anderson analyzed the novelty of Einstein's theory of gravity as its\nlack of \"absolute objects.\" Michael Friedman's related work has been criticized\nby Roger Jones and Robert Geroch for implausibly admitting as absolute the\ntimelike 4-velocity field of dust in cosmological models in Einstein's theory.\nUsing the Rosen-Sorkin Lagrange multiplier trick, I complete Anna Maidens's\nargument that the problem is not solved by prohibiting variation of absolute\nobjects in an action principle. Recalling Anderson's proscription of\n\"irrelevant\" variables, I generalize that proscription to locally irrelevant\nvariables that do no work in some places in some models. This move vindicates\nFriedman's intuitions and removes the Jones-Geroch counterexample: some regions\nof some models of gravity with dust are dust-free and so naturally lack a\ntimelike 4-velocity, so diffeomorphic equivalence to (1,0,0,0) is spoiled.\nTorretti's example involving constant curvature spaces is shown to have an\nabsolute object on Anderson's analysis, viz., the conformal spatial metric\ndensity. The previously neglected threat of an absolute object from an\northonormal tetrad used for coupling spinors to gravity appears resolvable by\neliminating irrelevant fields. However, given Anderson's definition, GTR itself\nhas an absolute object (as Robert Geroch has observed recently): a change of\nvariables to a conformal metric density and a scalar density shows that the\nlatter is absolute.\n", "  We use an instrument combining optical (surface plasmon resonance) and\nacoustic (Love mode acoustic wave device) real-time measurements on a same\nsurface for the identification of water content in collagen and fibrinogen\nprotein layers. After calibration of the surface acoustic wave device\nsensitivity by copper electrodeposition, the bound mass and its physical\nproperties -- density and optical index -- are extracted from the complementary\nmeasurement techniques and lead to thickness and water ratio values compatible\nwith the observed signal shifts. Such results are especially usefully for\nprotein layers with a high water content as shown here for collagen on an\nhydrophobic surface. We obtain the following results: collagen layers include\n70+/-20 % water and are 16+/-3 to 19+/-3 nm thick for bulk concentrations\nranging from 30 to 300 ug/ml. Fibrinogen layers include 50+/-10 % water for\nlayer thicknesses in the 6+/-1.5 to 13+/-2 nm range when the bulk concentration\nis in the 46 to 460 ug/ml range.\n"]}
