We discuss when the\nsolutions are global in time or blow-up in finite time. Some results, in\ndependence of the data of the problem, are proved; in particular we give a\nbound, depending on the coupling parameter, for the blow-up threshold.\n", "  It has been pointed out that for some types of measurement the Heisenberg\nuncertainty relation seems to be violated. In order to save the situation a new\nuncertainty relation was proposed by Ozawa. Here we introduce revised\ndefinitions of error and disturbance taking into account the gain associated\nwith generalized measurement interactions. With these new definitions, the\nvalidity of the Heisenberg inequality is recovered for continuous linear\nmeasurement interactions. We also examine the changes in distribution functions\ncaused by the general measurement interaction and clarify the physical meanings\nof infinitely large errors and disturbances.\n", "  Auger results on clustering of > 60 EeV ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR)\nions and the interpretation of the gamma-ray spectra of TeV blazars are\nconnected by effects from the extragalactic background light (EBL). The EBL\nacts as an obscuring medium for gamma rays and a reprocessing medium for UHECR\nions and protons, causing the GZK cutoff. The study of the physics underlying\nthe coincidence between the GZK energy and the clustering energy of UHECR ions\nfavors a composition of > 60 EeV UHECRs in CNO group nucleons. This has\ninteresting implications for the sources of UHECRs. We also comment on the\nAuger analysis.\n", "  We show a family of virial-type identities for the Schr\\\"odinger and wave\nequations with electromagnetic potentials. As a consequence, some weak\ndispersive inequalities in space dimension $n\\geq3$, involving Morawetz and\nsmoothing estimates, are proved; finally, we apply them to prove Strichartz\ninequalities for the wave equation with a non-trapping electromagnetic\npotential with almost Coulomb decay.\n", "  We prove a local in time smoothing estimate for a magnetic Schrodinger\nequation with coefficients growing polynomially at spatial infinity. The\nassumptions on the magnetic field are gauge invariant and involve only the\nfirst two derivatives. The proof is based on the multiplier method and no\npseudofferential techniques are required.\n", "  After the discovery that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are ubiquitous at\nthe center of stellar spheroids and that their mass Mbh, in the range 10^6-10^9\nMsun, is tightly related to global properties of the host stellar system, the\nidea of the co-evolution of elliptical galaxies and of their SMBHs has become a\ncentral topic of modern astrophysics. Here, I summarize some consequences that\ncan be derived from the galaxy Scaling Laws (SLs) and present a coherent\nscenario for the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies and their\ncentral SMBHs, focusing in particular on the establishment and maintenance of\ntheir SLs. In particular, after a first observationally based part, the\ndiscussion focuses on the physical interpretation of the Fundamental Plane.\nThen, two important processes in principle able to destroy the galaxy and SMBH\nSLs, namely galaxy merging and cooling flows, are analyzed. Arguments\nsupporting the necessity to clearly distinguish between the origin and\nmaintenance of the different SLs, and the unavoidable occurrence of SMBH\nfeedback on the galaxy ISM in the late stages of galaxy evolution (when\nelliptical galaxies are sometimes considered as ``dead, red objects''), are\nthen presented. At the end of the paper I will discuss some implications of the\nrecent discovery of super-dense ellipticals in the distant Universe. In\nparticular, I will argue that, if confirmed, these new observations would lead\nto the conclusion that at early epochs a relation between the stellar mass of\nthe galaxy and the mass of the central SMBH should hold, consistent with the\npresent day Magorrian relation, while the proportionality coefficient between\nMbh and the scale of velocity dispersion of the hosting spheroids should be\nsignificantly smaller than that at the present epoch.\n", "  It is generally considered, as a rule of thumb, that carbon monoxide forms\nvery early in envelopes of AGB stars, and that it consumes most of the carbon,\nor most of the oxygen, depending on whether the photosphere is oxygen-rich or\ncarbon-rich, respectively. \\rm This work focuses on the latter case, with the\npurpose of quantifying the remaining fraction of gaseous carbon which is then\navailable for forming carbonaceous grains. Since AGB stars are (probably) the\nmain providers of cosmic carbon grains, this residual fraction is essential in\nestablishing the validity of current grain models. Here, we use a kinetic\ntreatment to follow the chemical evolution of circumstellar shells towards\nsteady state. It is shown that the residual fraction depends essentially on the\natomic ratio of pristine gaseous carbon and oxygen, and on the cross-section\nfor CH formation by collision of C and H atoms. It lies between 55 and 144 C\natoms per million H atoms, depending on the values adopted for unknown reaction\nrates and cosmic C abundance. This is much larger than predicted by the rule of\nthumb recalled above.\n  The present results depend strongly on the rate of the reaction C+H-->CH: far\nfrom thermodynamic equilibrium (which is the case here), CO cannot be formed if\nthis rate is as low as generally assumed. We have, therefore, estimated this\nrate by chemically modelling the reaction and found it indeed much higher, and\nhigh enough to yield CO abundances compatible with observations. An accurate\nexperimental rate determination is highly desirable.\n", "  Effective temperatures of early-type supergiants are important to test\nstellar atmosphere- and internal structure-models of massive and intermediate\nmass objects at different evolutionary phases. However, these Teff values are\nmore or less discrepant depending on the method used to determine them. We aim\nto obtain a new calibration of the Teff parameter for early-type supergiants as\na function of observational quantities that are highly sensitive to the\nionization balance in the photosphere and its gas pressure, independent of the\ninterstellar extinction, and as much as possible model-independent. The\nobservational quantities that best address our aims are the (lambda1, D)\nparameters of the BCD spectrophotometric system. They describe the energy\ndistribution around the Balmer discontinuity, which is highly sensitive to Teff\nand logg. We perform a calibration of the (lambda1, D) parameters into Teff\nusing effective temperatures derived with the bolometric-flux method for 217\nprogram stars, whose individual absolute relative uncertainties are on average\n0.05. The final comparison of calculated with obtained Teff values in the\n(lambda1,D) calibration further show that the latter have total relative\nuncertainties, which on average are of the order of 0.05 for all spectral types\nand luminosity classes. The effective temperatures of OB supergiants derived in\nthis work agree on average within some 2000 K with other determinations found\nin the literature, except those issued from wind-free non-LTE plane-parallel\nmodels of stellar atmospheres, which produce effective temperatures that can be\noverestimated by up to more than 5000 K near Teff = 25000 K.\n", "  We report results from an intensive multiwavelength campaign on the\nintermediate-frequency-peaked BL Lacertae object W Com (z=0.102) during a\nstrong outburst of very high energy gamma-ray emission in June 2008. The very\nhigh energy gamma-ray signal was detected by VERITAS on 2008 June 7-8 with a\nflux F(>200 GeV) = (5.7+-0.6)x10^-11 cm-2s-1, about three times brighter than\nduring the discovery of gamma-ray emission from W Com by VERITAS in 2008 March.\nThe initial detection of this flare by VERITAS at energies above 200 GeV was\nfollowed by observations in high energy gamma-rays (AGILE, E>100 MeV), and\nX-rays (Swift and XMM-Newton), and at UV, and ground-based optical and radio\nmonitoring through the GASP-WEBT consortium and other observatories. Here we\ndescribe the multiwavelength data and derive the spectral energy distribution\n(SED) of the source from contemporaneous data taken throughout the flare.\n", "  An EMCCD camera, designed from the ground up for extreme faint flux imaging,\nis presented. CCCP, the CCD Controller for Counting Photons, has been\nintegrated with a CCD97 EMCCD from e2v technologies into a scientific camera at\nthe Laboratoire d'Astrophysique Exp\\'erimentale (LAE), Universit\\'e de\nMontr\\'eal. This new camera achieves sub-electron read-out noise and very low\nClock Induced Charge (CIC) levels, which are mandatory for extreme faint flux\nimaging. Data gathered with the camera suggests that through enhanced\nmanufacturing processes, which would avoid traps from being created, and with\nthe help of the clock shapes producible with CCCP, the CIC generated during the\nvertical transfer could be virtually suppressed. The camera has been\ncharacterized in laboratory and used on the Observatoire du Mont M\\'egantic\n1.6-m telescope. The performance of the camera is discussed and experimental\ndata with the first scientific data are presented.\n", "  We report the first detection of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission\nabove 140 GeV from PKS 1424+240, a BL Lac object with an unknown redshift. The\nphoton spectrum above 140 GeV measured by VERITAS is well described by a power\nlaw with a photon index of 3.8 +- 0.5_stat +- 0.3_syst and a flux normalization\nat 200 GeV of (5.1 +- 0.9_stat +- 0.5_syst) x 10^{-11} TeV^-1 cm^-2 s^-1, where\nstat and syst denote the statistical and systematical uncertainty,\nrespectively. The VHE flux is steady over the observation period between MJD\n54881 and 55003 (2009 February 19 to June 21). Flux variability is also not\nobserved in contemporaneous high energy observations with the Fermi Large Area\nTelescope (LAT). Contemporaneous X-ray and optical data were also obtained from\nthe Swift XRT and MDM observatory, respectively. The broadband spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) is well described by a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton\n(SSC) model favoring a redshift of less than 0.1. Using the photon index\nmeasured with Fermi in combination with recent extragalactic background light\n(EBL) absorption models it can be concluded from the VERITAS data that the\nredshift of PKS 1424+240 is less than 0.66.\n", "  Oblivious transfer is a fundamental primitive in cryptography. While perfect\ninformation theoretic security is impossible, quantum oblivious transfer\nprotocols can limit the dishonest players' cheating. Finding the optimal\nsecurity parameters in such protocols is an important open question. In this\npaper we show that every 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer protocol allows a\ndishonest party to cheat with probability bounded below by a constant strictly\nlarger than 1/2. Alice's cheating is defined as her probability of guessing\nBob's index, and Bob's cheating is defined as his probability of guessing both\ninput bits of Alice. In our proof, we relate these cheating probabilities to\nthe cheating probabilities of a coin flipping protocol and conclude by using\nKitaev's coin flipping lower bound. Then, we present an oblivious transfer\nprotocol with two messages and cheating probabilities at most 3/4. Last, we\nextend Kitaev's semidefinite programming formulation to more general\nprimitives, where the security is against a dishonest player trying to force\nthe outcome of the other player, and prove optimal lower and upper bounds for\nthem.\n", "  Oblivious transfer is the cryptographic primitive where Alice sends one of\ntwo bits to Bob but is oblivious to the bit received. Using quantum\ncommunication, we can build oblivious transfer protocols with security provably\nbetter than any protocol built using classical communication. However, with\nimperfect apparatus one needs to consider other attacks. In this paper we\npresent an oblivious transfer protocol which is impervious to lost messages.\n", "  The quasi-simultaneous multi-wavelength emission of TeV blazar 3C 66A is\nstudied by using a one-zone multi-component leptonic jet model. It is found\nthat the quasi-simultaneous spectral energy distribution (SED) of 3C 66A can be\nwell reproduced, especially its {\\it Fermi}-LAT first 3 months average spectrum\ncan be well reproduced by the synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) component plus\nexternal Compton (EC) component of the broad line region (BLR). Clues on its\nredshift and gamma-ray emission location are obtained. The results indicate the\nfollowing. (i) On the redshift; The theoretical intrinsic TeV spectra can be\npredicted by extrapolating the reproduced GeV spectra. Through comparing this\nextrapolated TeV spectra with the extragalactic background light (EBL)\ncorrected observed TeV spectra, it is suggested that the redshift of 3C 66A\ncould be between 0.1 and 0.3, the most likely value is $\\sim$ 0.2. (ii) On the\ngamma-ray emission location; To well reproduce the GeV emission of 3C 66A under\ndifferent assumptions on BLR, the gamma-ray emission region is always required\nto be beyond the inner zone of BLR. The BLR absorption effect on gamma-ray\nemission confirms this point.\n", "  The measured spectrum of kinetic Alfven wave fluctuations in the turbulent\nsolar wind plasma is used to calculate the electron and ion distribution\nfunctions resulting from quasi-linear diffusion. The modified ion distribution\nfunction is found to be unstable to long wavelength electromagnetic ion\ncyclotron waves. These waves pitch angle scatter the parallel ion velocity into\nperpendicular velocity which effectively increases the perpendicular ion\ntemperature.\n", "  OSIRIS (Optical System for Imaging and low Resolution Integrated\nSpectroscopy) is the first light instrument of the Gran Telescopio Canarias\n(GTC). It provides a flexible and competitive tunable filter (TF). Since it is\nbased on a Fabry-Perot interferometer working in collimated beam, the TF\ntransmission wavelength depends on the position of the target with respect to\nthe optical axis. This effect is non-negligible and must be accounted for in\nthe data reduction. Our paper establishes a wavelength calibration for OSIRIS\nTF with the accuracy required for spectrophotometric measurements using the\nfull field of view (FOV) of the instrument. The variation of the transmission\nwavelength $\\lambda(R)$ across the FOV is well described by\n$\\lambda(R)=\\lambda(0)/\\sqrt{1+(R/f_2)^2}$, where $\\lambda(0)$ is the central\nwavelength, $R$ represents the physical distance from the optical axis, and\n$f_2=185.70\\pm0.17\\,$mm is the effective focal length of the camera lens. This\nnew empirical calibration yields an accuracy better than 1\\,\\AA\\ across the\nentire OSIRIS FOV ($\\sim$8\\arcmin$\\times$8\\arcmin), provided that the position\nof the optical axis is known within 45 $\\mu$m ($\\equiv$ 1.5 binned pixels). We\nsuggest a calibration protocol to grant such precision over long periods, upon\nre-alignment of OSIRIS optics, and in different wavelength ranges. This\ncalibration differs from the calibration in OSIRIS manual which, nonetheless,\nprovides an accuracy $\\lesssim1$\\AA\\, for $R\\lesssim 2\\arcmin$.\n", "  We use third constraint formulation of Tsallis statistics and derive the\n$q$-statistics generalization of non-equilibrium work relations such as the\nJarzynski equality and the Crooks fluctuation theorem which relate the free\nenergy differences between two equilibrium states and the work distribution of\nthe non-equilibrium processes.\n", "  We calculate the expectation values of the stress-energy bitensor defined at\ntwo different spacetime points $x, x'$ of a massless, minimally coupled scalar\nfield with respect to a quantum state at finite temperature $T$ in a flat\n$N$-dimensional spacetime by means of the generalized zeta-function method.\nThese correlators, also known as the noise kernels, give the fluctuations of\nenergy and momentum density of a quantum field which are essential for the\ninvestigation of the physical effects of negative energy density in certain\nspacetimes or quantum states. They also act as the sources of the\nEinstein-Langevin equations in stochastic gravity which one can solve for the\ndynamics of metric fluctuations as in spacetime foams. In terms of\nconstitutions these correlators are one rung above (in the sense of the\ncorrelation -- BBGKY or Schwinger-Dyson -- hierarchies) the mean (vacuum and\nthermal expectation) values of the stress-energy tensor which drive the\nsemiclassical Einstein equation in semiclassical gravity. The low and the high\ntemperature expansions of these correlators are also given here: At low\ntemperatures, the leading order temperature dependence goes like $T^{N}$ while\nat high temperatures they have a $T^{2}$ dependence with the subleading terms\nexponentially suppressed by $e^{-T}$. We also discuss the singular behaviors of\nthe correlators in the $x'\\rightarrow x$ coincident limit as was done before\nfor massless conformal quantum fields.\n", "  We critically discuss the measure of very short time intervals. By means of a\n\"gedankenexperiment\", we describe an ideal clock based on the occurrence of\ncompletely random events. We show that the minimum time interval Delta t that\nthis clock can measure scales as the inverse of its size Delta r. This implies\nan uncertainty relation between space and time: Delta r Delta t > G \\hbar /\nc^4, where G, \\hbar, and c are the Gravitational constant, the reduced Planck\nconstant, and the speed of light, respectively. We outline and briefly discuss\nthe implications of this uncertainty principle.\n", "  A new slender-body theory for viscous flow, based on the concepts of\ndimensional reduction and hyperviscous regularization, is presented. The\ngeometry of flat, elongated, or point-like rigid bodies immersed in a viscous\nfluid is approximated by lower-dimensional objects, and a hyperviscous term is\nadded to the flow equation. The hyperviscosity is given by the product of the\nordinary viscosity with the square of a length that is shown to play the role\nof effective thickness of any lower-dimensional object. Explicit solutions of\nsimple problems illustrate how the proposed method is able to represent with\ngood approximation both the velocity field and the drag forces generated by\nrigid motions of the immersed bodies, in analogy with classical slender-body\ntheories. This approach has the potential to open up the way to more effective\ncomputational techniques, since the complexity of the geometry can be\nsignificantly reduced. This, however, is achieved at the expense of involving\nhigher-order derivatives of the velocity field. Importantly, both the\ndimensional reduction and the hyperviscous regularization, combined with\nsuitable numerical schemes, can be used also in situations where inertia is not\nnegligible.\n", "  The paper is devoted to the study of the motion of one-dimensional rigid\nbodies during a free fall in a quasi-Newtonian hyperviscous fluid at low\nReynolds number. We show the existence of a steady solution and furnish\nsufficient conditions on the geometry of the body in order to get purely\ntranslational motions. Such conditions are based on a generalized version of\nthe so-called Reciprocal Theorem for fluids.\n", "  We consider the free fall of slender rigid bodies in a viscous incompressible\nfluid. We show that the dimensional reduction (DR), performed by substituting\nthe slender bodies with one-dimensional rigid objects, together with a\nhyperviscous regularization (HR) of the Navier--Stokes equation for the\nthree-dimensional fluid lead to a well-posed fluid-structure interaction\nproblem. In contrast to what can be achieved within a classical framework, the\nhyperviscous term permits a sound definition of the viscous force acting on the\none-dimensional immersed body. Those results show that the DR/HR procedure can\nbe effectively employed for the mathematical modeling of the free fall problem\nin the slender-body limit.\n", "  We investigate the mathematical structure of unit systems and the relations\nbetween them. Looking over the entire set of unit systems, we can find a\nmathematical structure that is called preorder (or quasi-order). For some pair\nof unit systems, there exists a relation of preorder such that one unit system\nis transferable to the other unit system. The transfer (or conversion) is\npossible only when all of the quantities distinguishable in the latter system\nare always distinguishable in the former system. By utilizing this structure,\nwe can systematically compare the representations in different unit systems.\nEspecially, the equivalence class of unit systems (EUS) plays an important role\nbecause the representations of physical quantities and equations are of the\nsame form in unit systems belonging to an EUS. The dimension of quantities is\nuniquely defined in each EUS. The EUS's form a partially ordered set. Using\nthese mathematical structures, unit systems and EUS's are systematically\nclassified and organized as a hierarchical tree.\n", "  Through the action of anti-holomorphic involutions on a compact Riemann\nsurface, we construct families of (A,B,A)-branes in the moduli spaces of\nG_c-Higgs bundles on the Riemann surface. We study the geometry of these\n(A,B,A)-branes in terms of spectral data and show they have the structure of\nreal integrable systems.\n", "  Given a group $G$ and an abelian $C^*$-algebra $\\mathfrak{A}$, the\nantihomomorphisms $\\Theta\\colon G\\rightarrow \\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathfrak{A})$ are in\none-to-one with those left actions $\\Phi\\colon G\\times\n\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathfrak{A})\\rightarrow \\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathfrak{A})$ whose\ntranslation maps $\\Phi_g$ are continuous; whereby continuities of $\\Theta$ and\n$\\Phi$ turn out to be equivalent if $\\mathfrak{A}$ is unital. In particular, a\nleft action $\\phi\\colon G \\times X\\rightarrow X$ can be uniquely extended to\nthe spectrum of a $C^*$-subalgebra $\\mathfrak{A}$ of the bounded functions on\n$X$ if $\\phi_g^*(\\mathfrak{A})\\subseteq \\mathfrak{A}$ holds for each $g\\in G$.\nIn the present paper, we apply this to the framework of loop quantum gravity.\nWe show that, on the level of the configuration spaces, quantization and\nreduction in general do not commute, i.e., that the symmetry-reduced quantum\nconfiguration space is (strictly) larger than the quantized configuration space\nof the reduced classical theory. Here, the quantum-reduced space has the\nadvantage to be completely characterized by a simple algebraic relation,\nwhereby the quantized reduced classical space is usually hard to compute.\n", "  We prove a sharp version of the Hardy uncertainty principle for Schr\\\"odinger\nequations with external bounded electromagnetic potentials, based on\nlogarithmic convexity properties of Schr\\\"odinger evolutions. We provide, in\naddition, an example of a real electromagnetic potential which produces the\nexistence of solutions with critical gaussian decay, at two distinct times.\n", "  Spin transport electronics - spintronics - focuses on utilizing electron spin\nas a state variable for quantum and classical information processing and\nstorage. Some insulating materials, such as diamond, offer defect centers whose\nassociated spins are well-isolated from their environment giving them long\ncoherence times; however, spin interactions are important for transport,\nentanglement, and read-out. Here, we report direct measurement of pure spin\ntransport - free of any charge motion - within a nanoscale quasi 1D 'spin\nwire', and find a spin diffusion length ~ 700 nm. We exploit the statistical\nfluctuations of a small number of spins ($\\sqrt{N}$ < 100 net spins) which are\nin thermal equilibrium and have no imposed polarization gradient. The spin\ntransport proceeds by means of magnetic dipole interactions that induce\nflip-flop transitions, a mechanism that can enable highly efficient, even\nreversible, pure spin currents. To further study the dynamics within the spin\nwire, we implement a magnetic resonance protocol that improves spatial\nresolution and provides nanoscale spectroscopic information which confirms the\nobserved spin transport. This spectroscopic tool opens a potential route for\nspatially encoding spin information in long-lived nuclear spin states. Our\nmeasurements probe intrinsic spin dynamics at the nanometre scale, providing\ndetailed insight needed for practical devices which seek to control spin.\n", "  We deal with Dirac operators with external homogeneous magnetic fields.\nHardy-type inequalities related to these operators are investigated: for a\nsuitable class of transversal magnetic fields, we prove a Hardy inequality with\nthe same best constant as in the free case. This leaves naturally open an\ninteresting question whether there exist magnetic fields for which a Hardy\ninequality with a better constant than the usual one, in connection with the\nwell known diamagnetic phenomenon arising in non-relativistic models.\n", "  The Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope is a\npair-conversion telescope designed to detect photons with energies from 20 MeV\nto > 300 GeV. The pre-launch response functions of the LAT were determined\nthrough extensive Monte Carlo simulations and beam tests. The point-spread\nfunction (PSF) characterizing the angular distribution of reconstructed photons\nas a function of energy and geometry in the detector is determined here from\ntwo years of on-orbit data by examining the distributions of \\gamma rays from\npulsars and active galactic nuclei (AGN). Above 3 GeV, the PSF is found to be\nbroader than the pre-launch PSF. We checked for dependence of the PSF on the\nclass of \\gamma-ray source and observation epoch and found none. We also\ninvestigated several possible spatial models for pair-halo emission around BL\nLac AGN. We found no evidence for a component with spatial extension larger\nthan the PSF and set upper limits on the amplitude of halo emission in stacked\nimages of low and high redshift BL Lac AGN and the TeV blazars 1ES0229+200 and\n1ES0347-121.\n", "  Systems with long-range (LR) forces, for which the interaction potential\ndecays with the interparticle distance with an exponent smaller than the\ndimensionality of the embedding space, remain an outstanding challenge to\nstatistical physics. The internal energy of such systems lacks extensivity and\nadditivity. Although the extensivity can be restored by scaling the interaction\npotential with the number of particles, the non-additivity still remains. Lack\nof additivity leads to inequivalence of statistical ensembles. Before relaxing\nto thermodynamic equilibrium, isolated systems with LR forces become trapped in\nout-of-equilibrium quasi-stationary state (qSS), the lifetime of which diverges\nwith the number of particles. Therefore, in thermodynamic limit LR systems will\nnot relax to equilibrium. The qSSs are attained through the process of\ncollisionless relaxation. Density oscillations lead to particle-wave\ninteractions and excitation of parametric resonances. The resonant particles\nescape from the main cluster to form a tenuous halo. Simultaneously, this cools\ndown the core of the distribution and dampens out the oscillations. When all\nthe oscillations die out the ergodicity is broken and a qSS is born. In this\nreport, we will review a theory which allows us to quantitatively predict the\nparticle distribution in the qSS. The theory is applied to various LR\ninteracting systems, ranging from plasmas to self-gravitating clusters and\nkinetic spin models.\n", "  We study time-like hypersurfaces with vanishing mean curvature in the (3+1)\ndimensional Minkowski space, which are the hyperbolic counterparts to minimal\nembeddings of Riemannian manifolds. The catenoid is a stationary solution of\nthe associated Cauchy problem. This solution is linearly unstable, and we show\nthat this instability is the only obstruction to the global nonlinear stability\nof the catenoid. More precisely, we prove in a certain symmetry class the\nexistence, in the neighborhood of the catenoid initial data, of a co-dimension\n1 Lipschitz manifold transverse to the unstable mode consisting of initial data\nwhose solutions exist globally in time and converge asymptotically to the\ncatenoid.\n", "  Convective envelopes in stars on the main sequence are usually connected only\nwith stars of spectral types F5 or later. However, observations as well as\ntheory indicate that the convective outer layers in earlier stars, despite\nbeing shallow, are still effective and turbulent enough to stochastically\nexcite oscillations. Because of the low amplitudes, exploring stochastically\nexcited pulsations became possible only with space missions such as Kepler and\nCoRoT. Here I review the recent results and discuss among others, pulsators\nsuch as delta Scuti, gamma Doradus, roAp, beta Cephei, Slowly Pulsating B and\nBe stars, all in the context of solar-like oscillations.\n", "  We perform a model independent analysis of the helicity amplitudes at high\nenergy for all the $2\\to2$ scattering processes involving gauge and Higgs\nbosons in the presence of anomalous $WWV$, $WWVV$, $VVH$, $VVHH$ ($V\\equiv\nZ,\\gamma$ and $W^\\pm$), $HHHH$ and $HHH$ interactions. We obtain the\nperturbative unitarity constraints on anomalous couplings by demanding the\nvanishing of terms proportional to $s^2$ and $s^{3/2}$ in the helicity\namplitudes. Using these constraints, we also compute the upper bound on all the\nanomalous couplings from terms linear in $s$.\n  Further, assuming all anomalous couplings to have arisen only from dimension\nsix operators, we show that the perturbative unitarity violation can be evaded\nup to $\\sim$ 9 TeV corresponding to the best fit values of $f_{WW}/\\Lambda^2$\nand $f_{BB}/\\Lambda^2$ from the combined analysis of Tevatron and LHC data.\n", "  BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects at high redshifts ($z\\geq 2$) are rarely\ndetected. Through careful analysis of the SDSS spectrum, BZB J1450+5201 is\nconfirmed to be a high-$z$ BL Lac object with $z\\geq$ 2.471 by identifying the\nLy$\\alpha$ 1216 and CIV 1548/1550 absorption lines. This indicates that BZB\nJ1450+5201 is the most distant BL Lac object discovered to date. Careful\nanalysis of the five-year \\fermi data of 2FGL J1451.0+5159 shows that its\n$\\gamma$-ray emission is robust with confidence level of 6.2$\\sigma$ at 1-3 GeV\nand 6.7$\\sigma$ at 3-10 GeV, and that the confusion of bright neighbor is\nnegligible, which can not be fixed in the analysis of the two-year data.\nMeanwhile, 2FGL J1451.0+5159 is confirmed to be associated with BZB J1450+5201\nusing the five-year data. The analysis of multiwavelength data, from radio to\n$\\gamma$-ray energies, indicates BZB J1450+5201 is an intermediate synchrotron\npeaked (ISP) source and consistent with distributions of other ISP sources at\nlower redshifts in the second LAT AGN catalog. The pure SSC model seems to be\ndisfavoured, while scattering of weak external emission plus SSC process can\nprovide a satisfactory description of the broadband emission.\n", "  We construct the moduli space of contact instantons, an analogue of\nYang-Mills instantons defined for contact metric $5$-manifolds and initiate the\nstudy of their structure. In the $K$-contact case we give sufficient conditions\nfor smoothness of the moduli space away from reducible connections and show the\ndimension is given by the index of an operator elliptic transverse to the Reeb\nfoliation. The moduli spaces are shown to be K\\\"ahler when the $5$-manifold $M$\nis Sasakian and hyperK\\\"ahler when $M$ is transverse Calabi-Yau. We show how\nthe transverse index can be computed in various cases, in particular we compute\nthe index for the toric Sasaki-Einstein spaces $Y^{p,q}$.\n", "  New terms to the dynamical equation of magnetization motion, associated with\nspin transport, have been reported over the past several years. Each newly\nidentified term is thought to possess both a real and an imaginary effective\nfield leading to fieldlike and dampinglike torques on magnetization. Here we\nshow that three metallic ferromagnets possess an imaginary effective-field term\nwhich mirrors the well-known real effective-field term associated with exchange\nin spin waves. Using perpendicular standing spin wave resonance between 2-26\nGHz, we evaluate the magnitude of the finite-wavenumber ($k$) dependent Gilbert\ndamping $\\alpha$ in three typical device ferromagnets, Ni$_{79}$Fe$_{21}$, Co,\nand Co$_{40}$Fe$_{40}$B$_{20}$, and demonstrate for the first time the presence\nof a $k^2$ term as $\\Delta\\alpha=\\Delta\\alpha_0+A_{k}\\cdot k^2$ in all three\nmetals. We interpret the new term as the continuum analog of spin pumping,\npredicted recently, and show that its magnitude, $A_{k}$=0.07-0.1 nm$^2$, is\nconsistent with transverse spin relaxation lengths as measured by conventional\n(interlayer) spin pumping.\n", "  We consider a model where the standard model is extended by the addition of a\nvector-like isosinglet down-type quark b'. We perform a chi square fit to the\nflavor physics data and obtain the preferred central values along with errors\nof all the elements of the measurable 3 X 4 quark mixing matrix. The fit\nindicates that all the new-physics parameters are consistent with zero and the\nmixing of the b' quark with the other three is constrained to be small. The\ncurrent flavor physics data rules out possibility of detectable new physics\nsignals in most of the flavor physics observables. We also investigate possible\ndeviations in the standard model Wtb couplings and bottom quark coupling to\nHiggs boson. We find that these deviations are less than a percent level which\nis too small to be observed at the LHC with current precision.\n", "  We study the magnetic response of a superconducting double strip, i.e., two\nparallel coplanar thin strips of width $2w$, thickness $d \\ll w$ and of\ninfinite length, separated by a gap of width $2s$ and subject to a\nperpendicular magnetic field $H$. The magnetic properties of this system are\ngoverned by the presence of a geometric energy barrier for vortex penetration\nwhich we investigate as a function of applied field $H$ and gap parameter $s$.\nThe new results deal with the case of a narrow gap $s \\ll w$, where the field\npenetration from the inner edges is facilitated by large flux focusing. Upon\nreducing the gap width $2s$, we observe a considerable rearrangement of the\nscreening currents, leading to a strong reduction of the penetration field and\nthe overall magnetization loop, with a suppression factor reaching $\\sim\n(d/w)^{1/2}$ as the gap drops below the sample thickness, $2s < d$. We compare\nour results with similar systems of different shapes (elliptic, rectangular\nplatelet) and include effects of surface barriers as well. Furthermore, we\nverify that corrections arising from the magnetic response of the Shubnikov\nphase in the penetrated state are small and can be omitted. Extending the\nanalysis to multiple strips, we determine the specific sequence of flux\npenetrations into the different strips. Our studies are relevant for the\nunderstanding of platelet shaped samples with cracks or the penetration into\nlayered superconductors at oblique magnetic fields.\n", "  We investigate the modified $F(R)$ gravity theory with the function $F(R) =\n(1-\\sqrt{1-2\\lambda R-\\sigma (\\lambda R)^2})/\\lambda$. The action is converted\ninto Einstein$-$Hilbert action at small values of $\\lambda$ and $\\sigma$. The\nlocal tests give a bound on the parameters, $\\lambda(1+\\sigma)\\leq 2\\times\n10^{-6}$ cm$^2$. The Jordan and Einstein frames are considered, the potential,\nand the mass of the scalar field were obtained. The constant curvature\nsolutions of the model are found. It was demonstrated that the de Sitter space\nis unstable but a solution with zero Ricci scalar is stable. The cosmological\nparameters of the model are evaluated. Critical points of autonomous equations\nare obtained and described.\n", "  The sensitivity of climate models to increasing CO2 concentration and the\nclimate response at decadal time scales are still major factors of uncertainty\nfor the assessment of the long and short term effects of anthropogenic climate\nchange. While the relative slow progress on these issues is partly due to the\ninherent inaccuracies of numerical climate models, this also hints at the need\nfor stronger theoretical foundations to the problem of studying climate\nsensitivity and performing climate change predictions with numerical models.\nHere we demonstrate that it is possible to use Ruelle's response theory to\npredict the impact of an arbitrary CO2 forcing scenario on the global surface\ntemperature of a general circulation model. Response theory puts the concept of\nclimate sensitivity on firm theoretical grounds, and addresses rigorously the\nproblem of predictability at different time scales. Conceptually, our results\nshow that performing climate change experiments with general circulation models\nis a well defined problem from a physical and mathematical point of view.\nPractically, our results show that considering one single CO2 forcing scenario\nis enough to construct operators able to predict the response of climatic\nobservables to any other CO2 forcing scenario, without the need to perform\nadditional numerical simulations. We also introduce a general relationship\nbetween climate sensitivity and climate response at different time scales, thus\nproviding an explicit definition of the inertia of the system at different time\nscales. While what we report here refers to the linear response, the general\ntheory allows for treating nonlinear effects as well. Our results pave the way\nfor redesigning and interpreting climate change experiments from a radically\nnew perspective.\n", "  A habitable zone of a star is defined as a range of orbits within which a\nrocky planet can support liquid water on its surface. The most intriguing\nquestion driving the search for habitable planets is whether they host life.\nBut is the age of the planet important for its habitability? If we define\nhabitability as the ability of a planet to beget life, then probably not. After\nall, life on Earth has developed within only about 800 Myr after its formation.\nIf, however, we define habitability as our ability to detect life on the\nsurface of exoplanets, then age becomes a crucial parameter. Only after life\nhad evolved sufficiently complex to change its environment on a planetary\nscale, can we detect it remotely through its imprint on the atmosphere - the\nbiosignatures, out of which the photosynthetic oxygen is the most prominent\nindicator of developed life as we know it. But the onset of photosynthesis on\nplanets in habitable zones may take much longer time than the planetary age.\nThe knowledge of the age of a planet is necessary for developing a strategy to\nsearch for exoplanets carrying complex (developed) life - many confirmed\npotentially habitable planets are too young (orbiting Population I stars) and\nmay not have had enough time to develop and/or sustain detectable life. In the\nlast decade, many planets orbiting old (9-13 Gyr) metal-poor Population II\nstars have been discovered. Such planets had had enough time to develop\nnecessary chains of chemical reactions and may carry detectable life if located\nin a habitable zone. These old planets should be primary targets in search for\nthe extraterrestrial life.\n", "  A two-body quantum correlation is calculated for a particle reflecting from a\nmoving mirror. Correlated interference results when the incident and reflected\nparticle substates and their associated mirror substates overlap. Using the\nCopenhagen interpretation of measurement, an asynchronous joint probability\ndensity (PDF), which is a function both of the different positions and\ndifferent times at which the particle and mirror are measured, is derived\nassuming that no interaction occurs between each measurement. Measurement of\nthe particle first, in the correlated interference region, results in a\nsplitting of the mirror substate into ones which have and have not reflected\nthe particle. An analog of the interference from the Doppler effect for only\nmeasurements of the particle (a marginal PDF), in this two-body system, is\nshown to be a consequence of the asynchronous measurement. The simplification\nobtained for a microscopic particle reflecting from a mesoscopic or macroscopic\nmirror is used to illustrate asynchronous correlation interferometry. In this\ncase, the small displacement between these mirror states can yield negligible\nenvironmental decoherence times. In addition, interference of these mirror\nstates does not vanish in the limit of large mirror mass due to the small\nmomentum exchange in reflecting a microscopic particle.\n", "  Absorption is usually expected to be detrimental to quantum coherence\neffects. However, the situation for complex absorption spectra has been little\nstudied yet. We consider the resonance fluorescence of excitons in a\nsemiconductor quantum well. The creation of excitons requires absorption of the\nincoming pump-laser light. Thus, the absorption spectrum of the medium acts as\na spectral filter for the emitted light. Surprisingly, absorption can even\nimprove quantum effects, as is demonstrated for the squeezing of the resonance\nfluorescence of the quantum-well system. This effect can be explained by an\nimproved phase matching due to absorption.\n", "  We prove the sharp L^1-L^{\\infty} time-decay estimate for the 2D-Schroedinger\nequation with a general family of scaling critical electromagnetic potentials.\n", "  We investigate the azimuthal anisotropy $v_2$ of particle production in\nnucleus-nucleus collisions in the maximum entropy approach. This necessitates\ntwo new phenomenological input parameters $\\delta$ and $\\lambda_2$ compared\nwith integrated multiplicity distributions. The parameter $\\delta$ describes\nthe deformation of a flux tube and can be theoretically calculated in a bag\nmodel with a bag constant which depends on the density of surrounding flux\ntubes. The parameter $\\lambda_2$ defines the anisotropy of the particle\ndistribution in momentum space and can be connected to $\\delta$ via the\nuncertainty relation. In this framework we compute the anisotropy $v_2$ as a\nfunction of centrality, transverse momentum and rapidity in qualitative\nagreement with LHC data.\n", "  Xu [Jianwei Xu, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 45 405304 (2012)] generalized\ngeometric quantum discord [B.Dakic, V. Vedral, and C . Brukner, Phys. Rev.\nLett. 105 190502 (2010)] to multipartite states and proposed the geometric\nglobal quantum discord. In this paper, we first derive the analytical formulas\nof the geometric global quantum discord and geometric quantum discord for\ntwo-qubit X states, respectively. Second, we give five concrete examples to\ndemonstrate the use of our formulas. Finally, we prove that the geometric\nquantum discord is a tight lower bound of the geometric global quantum discord.\n", "  We report experiments on superconducting flux qubits in a circuit quantum\nelectrodynamics (cQED) setup. Two qubits, independently biased and controlled,\nare coupled to a coplanar waveguide resonator. Dispersive qubit state readout\nreaches a maximum contrast of $72\\,\\%$. We find intrinsic energy relaxation\ntimes at the symmetry point of $7\\,\\mu\\text{s}$ and $20\\,\\mu\\text{s}$ and\nlevels of flux noise of $2.6\\,\\mu \\Phi_0/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ and $2.7\\,\\mu\n\\Phi_0/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ at 1 Hz for the two qubits. We discuss the origin of\ndecoherence in the measured devices. These results demonstrate the potential of\ncQED as a platform for fundamental investigations of decoherence and quantum\ndynamics of flux qubits.\n", "  The central object in the theory of semiclassical stochastic gravity is the\nnoise kernel which is the symmetric two point correlation function of the\nstress-energy tensor. Using the corresponding Wightman functions in Minkowski,\nEinstein and open Einstein spaces, we construct the noise kernels of a\nconformally coupled scalar field in these spacetimes. From them we show that\nthe noise kernels in conformally-flat spacetimes, including the\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker universes, can be obtained in closed analytic forms\nby using a combination of conformal and coordindate transformations.\n", "  The Bochner Classification Theorem (1929) characterizes the polynomial\nsequences $\\p_{n}\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}$, with $\\text{deg}\\,p_{n}=n$ that\nsimultaneously form a complete set of eigenstates for a second-order\ndifferential operator and are orthogonal with respect to a positive Borel\nmeasure having finite moments of all orders. Indeed, up to a complex linear\nchange of variable, only the classical Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi\npolynomials satisfy these conditions. In 2009, G\\'{o}mez-Ullate, Kamran, and\nMilson found that for sequences $\\{p_{n}\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$,\n$\\text{deg}\\,p_{n}=n$ (without the constant polynomial), the only such\nsequences are the exceptional $X_{1}$-Laguerre and $X_{1}$-Jacobi polynomials.\nSubsequently, other exceptional orthogonal polynomials\n$\\{p_{n}\\}_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}_{0}\\diagdown A}$ were discovered and studied (here\n$A$ is a finite subset of the non-negative integers $\\mathbb{N}_{0}$ and\n$\\text{deg}\\,p_{n}=n$ for all $n\\in\\mathbb{N}_{0}\\diagdown A$). We call such a\nsequence an exceptional $X_{\\left\\vert A\\right\\vert}$ sequence. Remarkably, all\nexceptional sequences found, to date, form a complete orthogonal set in their\nnatural Hilbert space setting.\n  Among the exceptional sets already known are the Type I and Type II\n$X_{m}$-Laguerre polynomials, each omitting $m$ polynomials. We briefly discuss\nthese polynomials and construct self-adjoint operators generated by their\ncorresponding second-order differential expressions in appropriate Hilbert\nspaces. In addition, we present a new Type III family of $X_{m}$-Laguerre\npolynomials along with a detailed disquisition of its properties. We include\nseveral representations of these polynomials, orthogonality, norms,\ncompleteness, the location of their local extrema and roots, root asymptotics,\nas well as the spectral study of the second-order Type III exceptional\n$X_{m}$-Laguerre differential expression.\n", "  The energy scale of Dark Energy, $\\sim 2 \\times 10^{-3}$ eV, is a long way\noff compared to all known fundamental scales - except for the neutrino masses.\nIf Dark Energy is dynamical and couples to neutrinos, this is no longer a\ncoincidence. The time at which Dark Energy starts to behave as an effective\ncosmological constant can be linked to the time at which the cosmic neutrinos\nbecome nonrelativistic. This naturally places the onset of the Universe's\naccelerated expansion in recent cosmic history, addressing the why-now problem\nof Dark Energy. We show that these mechanisms indeed work in the Growing\nNeutrino Quintessence model - even if the fully nonlinear structure formation\nand backreaction are taken into account, which were previously suspected of\nspoiling the cosmological evolution. The attractive force between neutrinos\narising from their coupling to Dark Energy grows as large as $10^6$ times the\ngravitational strength. This induces very rapid dynamics of neutrino\nfluctuations which are nonlinear at redshift $z \\approx 2$. Nevertheless, a\nnonlinear stabilization phenomenon ensures only mildly nonlinear oscillating\nneutrino overdensities with a large-scale gravitational potential substantially\nsmaller than that of cold dark matter perturbations. Depending on model\nparameters, the signals of large-scale neutrino lumps may render the cosmic\nneutrino background observable.\n", "  In this article we provide a general mechanism for generating\ninteraction-enabled fermionic topological phases. We illustrate the mechanism\nwith crystalline symmetry-protected topological phases in 1D and 2D. These\nnon-trivial phases require interactions for their existence and, in the cases\nwe consider, the free-fermion classification yields only a trivial phase.\nSimilar to the interpretation of the Kitaev Majorana wire as a mean-field\np-wave superconductor Hamiltonian arising from an interacting model with\nquartic interactions, we show that our systems can be interpreted as\n\"mean-field\" charge-$4e$ superconductors arising, e.g., from an interacting\nmodel with eight-body interactions, or through another physical mechanism. The\nquartet superconducting nature allows for the teleportation of full Cooper\npairs, and in 2D for interesting semiclassical crystalline defects with\nnon-Abelian anyon boundstates.\n", "  A wormhole solution in Newtonian gravitation, enhanced through an equation\nrelating the Ricci scalar to the mass density, is presented. The wormhole\ninhabits a spherically symmetric curved space, with one throat and two\nasymptotically flat regions. Particle dynamics in this geometry is studied, and\nthe three distinct dynamical radii, namely, the geodesic, circumferential, and\ncurvature radii, appear naturally in the study of circular motion. Generic\nmotion is also analysed. A limiting case, although inconclusive, suggests the\npossibility of having a Newtonian black hole in a region of finite (nonzero)\nsize.\n", "  We study narrow-band biphoton generation from spontaneous four-wave mixing\nwith electromagnetically induced transparency in a laser cooled atomic\nensemble. We compare two formalisms in the interaction and Heisenberg pictures,\nand find that they agree in the low gain regime but disagree in the high gain\nregime. We extend both formalisms accounting the non-uniformity in atomic\ndensity and the driving laser fields. We find that for a fixed optical depth\nand a weak and far-detuned pump laser beam, the two-photon waveform is\nindependent of the atomic density distribution. However, the spatial profiles\nof the two driving laser beams have significant effects on the biphoton\ntemporal waveform. We predict that waveform shaping in time domain can be\nachieved by controlling the spatial profiles of the driving laser fields.\n", "  We apply the quantum-walk approach recently proposed in\narXiv:quant-ph-1506.04213 to a radical-pair reaction where realistic estimates\nfor the intermediate transition rates are available. The well-known average\nhitting time from quantum walks can be adopted as a measure of how quickly the\nreaction occurs and we calculate this for varying degrees of dephasing in the\nradical pair. The time for the radical pair to react to a product is found to\nbe independent of the amount of dephasing introduced, even in the limit of no\ndephasing where the transient population dynamics exhibit strong coherent\noscillations. This can be seen to arise from the existence of a rate-limiting\nstep in the reaction and we argue that in such examples, a purely classical\nmodel based on rate equations can be used for estimating the timescale of the\nreaction but not necessarily its population dynamics.\n", "  We study, numerically, the collective dynamics of self-rotating nonaligning\nparticles by considering a monolayer of spheres driven by constant clockwise or\ncounterclockwise torques. We show that hydrodynamic interactions alter the\nemergence of large-scale dynamical patterns compared to those observed in dry\nsystems. In dilute suspensions, the flow stirred by the rotors induces\nclustering of opposite-spin rotors, while at higher densities same-spin rotors\nphase separate. Above a critical rotor density, dynamic hexagonal crystals\nform. Our findings underscore the importance of inclusion of the many-body,\nlong-range hydrodynamic interactions in predicting the phase behavior of active\nparticles.\n", "  In this diagnostic study we analyze changes of rainfall seasonality and dry\nspells by the end of the twenty-first century under the most extreme IPCC5\nemission scenario (RCP8.5) as projected by twenty-four coupled climate models\nparticipating to Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5. We use estimates of\nthe centroid of the monthly rainfall distribution as an index of the rainfall\ntiming and a threshold-independent, information theory-based quantity such as\nrelative entropy (RE) to quantify the concentration of annual rainfall and the\nnumber of dry months and to build a monsoon dimensionless seasonality index\n(DSI). The RE is projected to increase, with high inter-model agreement over\nMediterranean-type regions (southern Europe, northern Africa and southern\nAustralia) and areas of South and Central America, implying an increase in the\nnumber of dry days up to one month by the end of the twenty-first century.\nPositive RE changes are also projected over the monsoon regions of southern\nAfrica and North America, South America. These trends are consistent with a\nshortening of the wet season associated with a more prolonged pre-monsoonal dry\nperiod. The extent of the global monsoon region, characterized by large DSI, is\nprojected to remain substantially unaltered. Centroid analysis shows that most\nof CMIP5 projections suggest that the monsoonal annual rainfall distribution is\nexpected to change from early to late in the course of the hydrological year by\nthe end of the twenty-first century and particularly after year 2050. This\ntrend is particularly evident over Northern Africa, Southern Africa and western\nMexico, where more than 90 % of the models project a delay of the rainfall\ncentroid from a few days up to two weeks. Over the remaining monsoonal regions,\nthere is little inter-model agreement in terms of centroid changes.\n", "  Progress of silicon based technology is nearing its physical limit, as\nminimum feature size of components is reaching a mere 10 nm. The resistive\nswitching behaviour of transition metal oxides and the associated memristor\ndevice is emerging as a competitive technology for next generation electronics.\nSignificant progress has already been made in the past decade and devices are\nbeginning to hit the market; however, it has been mainly the result of\nempirical trial and error. Hence, gaining theoretical insight is of essence. In\nthe present work we report the striking result of a connection between the\nresistive switching and {\\em shock wave} formation, a classic topic of\nnon-linear dynamics. We argue that the profile of oxygen vacancies that migrate\nduring the commutation forms a shock wave that propagates through a highly\nresistive region of the device. We validate the scenario by means of model\nsimulations and experiments in a manganese-oxide based memristor device. The\nshock wave scenario brings unprecedented physical insight and enables to\nrationalize the process of oxygen-vacancy-driven resistive change with direct\nimplications for a key technological aspect -- the commutation speed.\n", "  The recent realization that Sweet-Parker current sheets are violently\nunstable to the secondary tearing (plasmoid) instability implies that such\ncurrent sheets cannot occur in real systems. This suggests that, in order to\nunderstand the onset of magnetic reconnection, one needs to consider the growth\nof the tearing instability in a current layer as it is being formed. Such an\nanalysis is performed here in the context of nonlinear resistive MHD for a\ngeneric time-dependent equilibrium representing a gradually forming current\nsheet. It is shown that two onset regimes, single-island and multi-island, are\npossible, depending on the rate of current sheet formation. A simple model is\nused to compute the criterion for transition between these two regimes, as well\nas the reconnection onset time and the current sheet parameters at that moment.\nFor typical solar corona parameters this model yields results consistent with\nobservations.\n", "  Optical emitters strongly coupled to photons propagating in one-dimensional\nwaveguides are a promising platform for optical quantum information processing.\nHere, we present a theoretical study of the scattering of two indistinguishable\nphotons on a single two-level atom in a Hong-Ou-Mandel set-up. By computing the\ndynamics, we can describe the system at any time of the scattering event. This\nallows us to highlight the one-to-one correspondence between the saturation of\nthe atom and the effective interaction induced between the photons.\nFurthermore, we discuss the integrability of the atomic beamsplitter and\nprovide an intuitive picture for the correlations observed between the outgoing\nphotons.\n", "  A key question of quantum optics is how nonclassical bi-photon correlations\nat low power evolve into classical coherence at high-power. Direct observation\nof the crossover from quantum to classical behavior is desirable, but difficult\ndue to the lack of adequate experimental techniques that cover the ultra-wide\ndynamic range in photon flux from the single photon regime to the classical\nlevel. We investigate bi-photon correlations within the spectrum of light\ngenerated by broadband four-wave mixing (FWM) over a \\emph{large dynamic range\nof $\\sim80dB$ in photon flux} across the classical-to-quantum transition using\na two-photon interference effect that distinguishes between classical and\nquantum behavior. We explore the quantum-classical nature of the light by\nobserving the interference contrast dependence on internal loss and demonstrate\nquantum collapse and revival of the interference when the FWM gain in the fiber\nbecomes imaginary.\n", "  The goal of this research is to provide high resolution local, regional,\nnational and global estimates of annual mangrove forest area from 2000 through\nto 2012. To achieve this we synthesize the Global Forest Change database, the\nTerrestrial Ecosystems of the World database, and the Mangrove Forests of the\nWorld database to extract mangrove forest cover at high spatial and temporal\nresolutions. We then use the new database to monitor mangrove cover at the\nglobal, national and protected area scales. Countries showing relatively high\namounts of mangrove loss include Myanmar, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, and\nGuatemala. Indonesia remains by far the largest mangrove-holding nation,\ncontaining between 26 percent and 29 percent of the global mangrove inventory\nwith a deforestation rate of between 0.26 percent and 0.66 percent annually.\nGlobal mangrove deforestation continues but at a much reduced rate of between\n0.16 percent and 0.39 percent annually. Southeast Asia is a region of concern\nwith mangrove deforestation rates between 3.58 percent and 8.08 percent during\nthe analysis period, this in a region containing half of the entire global\nmangrove forest inventory. The global mangrove deforestation pattern from 2000\nto 2012 is one of decreasing rates of deforestation, with many nations\nessentially stable, with the exception of the largest mangrove-holding region\nof Southeast Asia. We provide a standardized global spatial dataset that\nmonitors mangrove deforestation globally at high spatiotemporal resolutions,\ncovering 99 percent of all mangrove forests. These data can be used to drive\nthe mangrove research agenda particularly as it pertains to improved monitoring\nof mangrove carbon stocks and the establishment of baseline local mangrove\nforest inventories required for payment for ecosystem service initiatives.\n", "  The vacuum entanglement entropy of Maxwell theory, when evaluated by standard\nmethods, contains an unexpected term with no known statistical interpretation.\nWe resolve this two-decades old puzzle by showing that this term is the\nentanglement entropy of edge modes: classical solutions determined by the\nelectric field normal to the entangling surface. We explain how the heat kernel\nregularization applied to this term leads to the negative divergent expression\nfound by Kabat. This calculation also resolves a recent puzzle concerning the\nlogarithmic divergences of gauge fields in 3+1 dimensions.\n", "  We investigate topological properties in the Fe(Te,Se) thin films. We find\nthat the single layer FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ has nontrivial $Z_2$ topological\ninvariance which originates from the parity exchange at $\\Gamma$ point of\nBrillouin zone. The nontrivial topology is mainly controlled by the Te(Se)\nheight. Adjusting the height, which can be realized as function of $x$ in\nFeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$, can drive a topological phase transition. In a bulk\nmaterial, the two dimensional $Z_2$ topology invariance is extended to a strong\nthree-dimensional one. In a thin film, we predict that the topological\ninvariance oscillates with the number of layers. The results can also be\napplied to iron-pnictides. Our research establishes FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ as a\nunique system to integrate high T$_c$ superconductivity and topological\nproperties in a single electronic structure.\n", "  This paper is dedicated to revisit the modifications caused by branes in the\ncollapse of a stellar structure under the Snyder-Oppenheimer scheme. Due to the\nhomogeneity and isotropy of the model, we choose study the case of a closed\ngeometry described by $k=1$, through the tool of dynamical systems. We revisit\nthe different components of the star and its evolution during the stellar\ncollapse, paying particular attention to the non-local effects and the\nquadratic terms of the energy momentum tensor that come from branes\ncorrections. In the same vein we realize a phase portrait together with a\nstability analysis with the aim of obtain information about the attractors or\nsaddle points of the dynamical system under different initial conditions in the\ndensity parameters, remarking the parameters that come from branes\ncontributions.\n", "  The operation of a high sensitive atomic magnetometer using resonant\nelliptically polarized light is demonstrated. The experimental geometry allows\nautonomous frequency stabilization of the laser, thereby offers compact\noperation of the overall device. The magnetometry is based on measurement of\nthe zero magnetic field resonance in degenerate two level system using\npolarimetric detection and has a preliminary sensitivity of <10 pT/Hz1/2 @ 1\nHz.\n", "  The statistics of the heat exchanged between two quantum XX spin chains\nprepared at different temperatures is studied within the assumption of weak\ncoupling. This provides simple formulas for the average heat and its\ncorresponding characteristic function, from which the probability distribu-\ntion may be computed numerically. These formulas are valid for arbitrary sizes\nand therefore allow us to analyze the role of the thermodynamic limit in this\nnon-equilibrium setting. It is found that all thermodynamic quantities are\nextremely sensitive to the quantum phase transition of the XX chain.\n", "  In this overview article we present a formalism suitable for constructing\nmodels of QFT's on curved spacetimes. The leading principle is the emphasis on\nlocal properties. It turns out that this requires a reformulation of the\nstandard QFT framework which also yields a new perspective for the theories on\nMinkowski space. The aim of the present work is to provide an introduction into\nthe framework, which should be accessible for both mathematical physicists and\nmathematicians.\n", "  In this article, we use quantum Langevin equations to provide a theoretical\nunderstanding of the non-classical behavior of Kerr optical frequency combs\nwhen pumped below and above threshold. In the configuration where the system is\nunder threshold, the pump field is the unique oscillating mode inside the\nresonator, and triggers the phenomenon of spontaneous four-wave mixing, where\ntwo photons from the pump are symmetrically up- and down-converted in the\nFourier domain. This phenomenon can only be understood and analyzed from a\nfully quantum perspective as a consequence of the coupling between the field of\nthe central (pumped) mode and the vacuum fluctuations of the various sidemodes.\nWe analytically calculate the power spectra of the spontaneous emission noise,\nand we show that these spectra can be either single- or double peaked depending\non the parameters of the system. We also calculate as well the overall\nspontaneous noise power per sidemode, and propose simplified analytical\nexpressions for some particular cases. In the configuration where the system is\npumped above threshold, we investigate the phenomena of quantum correlations\nand multimode squeezed states of light that can occur in the Kerr frequency\ncombs originating from stimulated four-wave mixing. We show that for all\nstationary spatio-temporal patterns, the side-modes that are symmetrical\nrelatively to the pumped mode in the frequency domain display quantum\ncorrelations that can lead to squeezed states of light. We also explicitly\ndetermine the phase quadratures leading to photon entanglement, and\nanalytically calculate their quantum noise spectra. We finally discuss the\nrelevance of Kerr combs for quantum information systems at optical\ntelecommunication wavelengths, below and above threshold.\n", "  In order to implement fault-tolerant quantum computation, entanglement\ngeneration with low error probability and high success probability is required.\nWe have proposed the use of squeezed coherent light as a probe to generate\nentanglement between two atoms by communication, and shown that the error\nprobability is reduced well below the threshold of fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputation [Phys. Rev. A. {\\bf 88}, 022313 (2013)]. Here, we investigate the\neffect of photon loss mainly due to finite coupling efficiency to the cavity.\nThe error probability with the photon loss is calculated by the beam-splitter\nmodel for homodyne measurement on probe light. Optimum condition on the\namplitude of probe light to minimize the error probability is examined. It is\nshown that the phase-squeezed probe light yields lower error probability than\ncoherent-light probe. A fault-tolerant quantum computation algorithm can be\nimplemented under 0.59 dB loss by concatenating five-qubit error correction\ncode.\n", "  We consider paradigmatic quenched disordered quantum spin models, viz., the\nXY spin glass and random-field XY models, and show that quenched averaged\nquantum correlations can exhibit the order-from-disorder phenomenon for\nfinite-size systems as well as in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, we find\nthat the order-from-disorder can get more pronounced in the presence of\ntemperature by suitable tuning of the system parameters. The effects are found\nfor entanglement measures as well as for information-theoretic quantum\ncorrelation ones, although the former show them more prominently. We also\nobserve that the equivalence between the quenched averages and their\nself-averaged cousins -- for classical and quantum correlations -- is related\nto the quantum critical point in the corresponding ordered system.\n", "  To explore a possible indirect method for $\\rm ^8Be$ induced astrophysical\nreactions, the $\\rm ^9Be=({}^8Be+\\it n)$ cluster structure was studied via the\nTrojan Horse Method. It is the first time to study a super short life nucleus\n$\\rm ^8Be$ via the Trojan Horse Method, and it is the first time to make a\nvalid test for $l=1$ Trojan-horse nucleus. The $\\rm ^9Be$ nucleus is assumed to\nhave a ($\\rm {}^8Be+\\it n$) cluster structure and used as the Trojan-horse\nnucleus. The $\\rm ^8Be$ nucleus acts as a participant, while the neutron is a\nspectator to the virtual $\\rm ^8Be +{\\it d}\\rightarrow \\alpha + {}^6Li$\nreaction via a suitable 3-body reaction $\\rm ^9Be +{\\it d}\\rightarrow \\alpha +\n{}^6Li +\\it n$. The experimental neutron momentum distribution inside $\\rm\n^9Be$ was reconstructed. The agreement between experimental and theoretical\nmomentum distribution indicates that there should be a ($\\rm {}^8Be+\\it n$)\ncluster structure inside $\\rm ^9Be$. Therefor the experimental study of $\\rm\n^8Be$ induced reactions, for example the experimental measurement of the $\\rm\n^8Be +\\alpha \\rightarrow {}^{12}C$ reaction proceeding through the Hoyle state,\nis possible.\n", "  We report the synthesis and the magnetic properties of single crystalline\nCeRhAl$_4$Si$_2$ and CeIrAl$_4$Si$_2$ and their non magnetic La-analogs. The\nsingle crystals of these quaternary compounds were grown using Al-Si binary\neutectic as flux. The anisotropic magnetic properties of the cerium compounds\nwere explored in detail by means of magnetic susceptibility, isothermal\nmagnetization, electrical resistivity, magnetoresistivity and heat capacity\nmeasurements. Both CeRhAl$_4$Si$_2$ and CeIrAl$_4$Si$_2$ undergo two\nantiferromagnetic transitions, first from the paramagnetic to an\nantiferromagnetic state at $T_{\\rm N1}$~=~12.6~K and 15.5~K, followed by a\nsecond transition at lower temperatures $T_{\\rm N2}$~=~9.4~K and 13.8~K,\nrespectively. The paramagnetic susceptibility is highly anisotropic and its\ntemperature dependence in the magnetically ordered state suggests the $c$-axis\nto be the relatively easy axis of magnetization. Concomitantly, isothermal\nmagnetization at 2~K along the $c$-axis shows a sharp spin-flop transition\naccompanied by a sizeable hysteresis, while it varies nearly linearly with\nfield along the [100] direction up to the highest field 14~T, of our\nmeasurement. The electrical resistivity provides evidence of the Kondo\ninteraction in both compounds, inferred from its $-lnT$ behavior in the\nparamagnetic region. The heat capacity data confirm the bulk nature of the two\nmagnetic transitions in each compound, and further confirm the presence of\nKondo interaction by a reduced value of the entropy associated with the\nmagnetic ordering. From the heat capacity data below 1~K, the coefficient of\nthe linear term in the electronic heat capacity, $\\gamma$, is inferred to be\n195.6 and 49.4~mJ/mol K$^2$ in CeRhAl$_4$Si$_2$ and CeIrAl$_4$Si$_2$,\nrespectively classifying these materials as moderate heavy fermion compounds.\n", "  The spatial distribution of people exhibits clustering across a wide range of\nscales, from household ($\\sim 10^{-2}$ km) to continental ($\\sim 10^4$ km)\nscales. Empirical data indicates simple power-law scalings for the size\ndistribution of cities (known as Zipf's law) and the population density\nfluctuations as a function of scale. Using techniques from random field theory\nand statistical physics, we show that these power laws are fundamentally a\nconsequence of the scale-free spatial clustering of human populations and the\nfact that humans inhabit a two-dimensional surface. In this sense, the\nsymmetries of scale invariance in two spatial dimensions are intimately\nconnected to urban sociology. We test our theory by empirically measuring the\npower spectrum of population density fluctuations and show that the logarithmic\nslope $\\alpha = 2.04 \\pm 0.09$, in excellent agreement with our theoretical\nprediction $\\alpha = 2$. The model enables the analytic computation of many new\npredictions by importing the mathematical formalism of random fields.\n", "  Remote state preparation is generation of a desired state by a remote\nobserver. In spite of causality, it is well known, according to the\nReeh-Schlieder theorem, that it is possible for relativistic quantum field\ntheories, and a \"physical\" process achieving this task, involving\nsuperoscillatory functions, has recently been introduced. In this work we deal\nwith non-relativistic fields, and show that remote state preparation is also\npossible for them, hence obtaining a Reeh-Schlieder-like result for general\nfields. Interestingly, in the nonrelativistic case, the process may rely on\ncompletely different resources than the ones used in the relativistic case.\n", "  The observation of the violation of Lam-Tung relation in the $\\pi N$\nDrell-Yan process triggered many theoretical speculations. The TMD Boer-Mulders\nfunctions characterizing the correlation of transverse momentum and transverse\nspin for partons in unpolarized hadrons could nicely account for the violation.\nThe COMPASS experiment at CERN will measure the angular distributions of\ndimuons from the unpolarized Drell-Yan process over a wide kinematic region and\nstudy the beam particle dependence. Significant statistics is expected from a\nsuccessful run in 2015 which will bring further understanding of the origin of\nthe violation of Lam-Tung relation and of the partonic transverse spin\nstructure of the nucleon.\n", "  In this work we model the quintessence potential in a Taylor series\nexpansion, up to second order, around the present-day value of the scalar\nfield. The field is evolved in a thawing regime assuming zero initial velocity.\nWe use the latest data from the Planck satellite, baryonic acoustic\noscillations observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and Supernovae\nluminosity distance information from Union2.1 to constrain our models\nparameters, and also include perturbation growth data from the WiggleZ, BOSS\nand the 6dF surveys. The supernova data provide the strongest individual\nconstraint on the potential parameters. We show that the growth data\nperformance is competitive with the other datasets in constraining the dark\nenergy parameters we introduce. We also conclude that the combined constraints\nwe obtain for our model parameters, when compared to previous works of nearly a\ndecade ago, have shown only modest improvement, even with new growth of\nstructure data added to previously-existent types of data.\n", "  Bumps are omnipresent from human skin to the geological structures on\nplanets, which offer distinct advantages in numerous phenomena including\nstructural color, drag reduction, and extreme wettability. Although the\ntopographical parameters of bumps such as radius of curvature of convex regions\nsignificantly influence various phenomena including anti-reflective structures\nand contact time of impacting droplets, the effect of the detailed bump\ntopography on growth and transport of condensates have not been clearly\nunderstood. Inspired by the millimetric bumps of the Namib Desert beetle, here\nwe report the identified role of radius of curvature and width of bumps with\nhomogeneous surface wettability in growth rate, coalescence and transport of\nwater droplets. Further rational design of asymmetric convex topography and\nsynergetic combination with slippery coating simultaneously enable\nself-transport, leading to unseen five-fold higher growth rate and an order of\nmagnitude faster shedding time of droplets compared to superhydrophobic\nsurfaces. We envision that our fundamental understanding and innovative design\nof bumps can be applied to lead enhanced performance in various phase change\napplications including water harvesting.\n", "  We compute the pion Generalized Parton Distribution (GPD) in a valence\ndressed quarks approach. We model the Mellin moments of the GPD using Ans\\\"atze\nfor Green functions inspired by the numerical solutions of the Dyson-Schwinger\nEquations (DSE) and the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE). Then, the GPD is\nreconstructed from its Mellin moment using the Double Distribution (DD)\nformalism. The agreement with available experimental data is very good.\n", "  The formation energies and electronic structure of europium doped zinc oxide\nhas been determined using DFT and many-body $GW$ methods. In the absence of\nintrisic defects we find that the europium-$f$ states are located in the ZnO\nband gap with europium possessing a formal charge of 2+. On the other hand, the\npresence of intrinsic defects in ZnO allows intraband $f-f$ transitions\notherwise forbidden in atomic europium. This result coorroborates with recently\nobserved photoluminescence in the visible red region [1].\n", "  Analytical models describing the motion of colloidal particles in given\nvelocity fields are presented. In addition to local approaches, leading to well\nknown master equations such as the Langevin and the Fokker-Planck equations, a\nglobal description based on path integration is reviewed. This shows that under\nvery broad conditions, during its evolution a dissipative system tends to\nminimize its energy dissipation in such a way to keep constant the Hamiltonian\ntime rate, equal to the difference between the flux-based and the force-based\nRayleigh dissipation functions. At steady state, the Hamiltonian time rate is\nmaximized, leading to a minimum resistance principle. In the unsteady case, we\nconsider the relaxation to equilibrium of harmonic oscillators and the motion\nof a Brownian particle in shear flow, obtaining results that coincide with the\nsolution of the Fokker-Planck and the Langevin equations.\n", "  A precise fiber-based time and frequency dissemination scheme for multiple\nusers with a tree-like branching topology is proposed. Through this scheme,\nultra-stable signals can be easily accessed online anywhere along the fiber\nwithout affecting other sites. The scheme is tested through an experiment, in\nwhich a modulated frequency signal and a synchronized time signal are\ntransferred to multiple remote sites over a delay-stabilized fiber optic links\nthat are over 50 km long. Results show that the relative stabilities are\n5E-14@1s and 2E-17@10000s. Meanwhile, compared with each site, time\nsynchronization precision is less than 80 ps. These results can pave the way to\npractical applications in joint time and frequency dissemination network\nsystems.\n", "  Plastic events in amorphous solids can be much more than just \"shear\ntransformation zones\" when the positional degrees of freedom are coupled\nnon-trivially to other degrees of freedom. Here we consider magnetic amorphous\nsolids where mechanical and magnetic degrees of freedom interact, leading to\nrather complex plastic events whose nature must be disentangled. In this paper\nwe uncover the anatomy of the various contributions to some typical plastic\nevents. These plastic events are seen as Barkhausen Noise or other \"serrated\nnoises\". Using theoretical considerations we explain the observed statistics of\nthe various contributions to the considered plastic events. The richness of\ncontributions and their different characteristics imply that in general the\nstatistics of these \"serrated noises\" cannot be universal, but rather highly\ndependent on the state of the system and on its microscopic interactions.\n", "  Due to its low atomic mass hydrogen is the most promising element to search\nfor high-temperature phononic superconductors. However, metallic phases of\nhydrogen are only expected at extreme pressures (400 GPa or higher). The\nmeasurement of a record superconducting critical temperature of 190 K in a\nhydrogen-sulfur compound at 200 GPa of pressure[1], shows that metallization of\nhydrogen can be reached at significantly lower pressure by inserting it in the\nmatrix of other elements. In this work we re-investigate the phase diagram and\nthe superconducting properties of the H-S system by means of minima hopping\nmethod for structure prediction and Density Functional theory for\nsuperconductors. We also show that Se-H has a similar phase diagram as its\nsulfur counterpart as well as high superconducting critical temperature. We\npredict SeH3 to exceed 120 K superconductivity at 100 GPa. We show that both\nSeH3 and SH3, due to the critical temperature and peculiar electronic\nstructure, present rather unusual superconducting properties.\n", "  We develop the spectral representation of propagator for $n$ mixing fermion\nfields in the case of $\\mathsf{P}$-parity violation. The approach based on the\neigenvalue problem for inverse matrix propagator makes possible to build the\nsystem of orthogonal projectors and to represent the matrix propagator as a sum\nof poles with positive and negative energies. The procedure of multiplicative\nrenormalization in terms of spectral representation is investigated and the\nrenormalization matrices are obtained in a closed form without the use of\nperturbation theory. Since in theory with $\\mathsf{P}$-parity violation the\nstandard spin projectors do not commute with the dressed propagator, they\nshould be modified. The developed approach allows us to build the modified\n(dressed) spin projectors for a single fermion and for a system of fermions.\n", "  In this paper, we apply a recently developed nonparametric modeling approach,\nthe \"diffusion forecast\", to predict the time-evolution of Fourier modes of\nturbulent dynamical systems. While the diffusion forecasting method assumes the\navailability of a noise-free training data set observing the full state space\nof the dynamics, in real applications we often have only partial observations\nwhich are corrupted by noise. To alleviate these practical issues, following\nthe theory of embedology, the diffusion model is built using the\ndelay-embedding coordinates of the data. We show that this delay embedding\nbiases the geometry of the data in a way which extracts the most stable\ncomponent of the dynamics and reduces the influence of independent additive\nobservation noise. The resulting diffusion forecast model approximates the\nsemigroup solutions of the generator of the underlying dynamics in the limit of\nlarge data and when the observation noise vanishes. As in any standard\nforecasting problem, the forecasting skill depends crucially on the accuracy of\nthe initial conditions. We introduce a novel Bayesian method for filtering the\ndiscrete-time noisy observations which works with the diffusion forecast to\ndetermine the forecast initial densities.\n  Numerically, we compare this nonparametric approach with standard stochastic\nparametric models on a wide-range of well-studied turbulent modes, including\nthe Lorenz-96 model in weakly chaotic to fully turbulent regimes and the\nbarotropic modes of a quasi-geostrophic model with baroclinic instabilities. We\nshow that when the only available data is the low-dimensional set of noisy\nmodes that are being modeled, the diffusion forecast is indeed competitive to\nthe perfect model.\n", "  Systems that comprise many interacting dynamical networks, such as the human\nbody with its biological networks or the global economic network consisting of\nregional clusters, often exhibit complicated collective dynamics. To understand\nthe collective behavior of such systems, we investigate a model of interacting\nnetworks exhibiting the fundamental processes of failure, damage spread, and\nrecovery. We find a very rich phase diagram that becomes exponentially more\ncomplex as the number of networks is increased. In the simplest example of\n$n=2$ interacting networks we find two critical points, 4 triple points, 10\nallowed transitions, and two \"forbidden\" transitions, as well as complex\nhysteresis loops. Remarkably, we find that triple points play the dominant role\nin constructing the optimal repairing strategy in damaged interacting systems.\nTo support our model, we analyze an example of real interacting financial\nnetworks and find evidence of rapid dynamical transitions between well-defined\nstates, in agreement with the predictions of our model.\n", "  Many agent based simulation approaches have been proposed for pedestrian\nflow. As such models are applied e.g.\\ in evacuation studies, the quality and\nreliability of such models is of vital interest. Pedestrian trajectories are\nfunctional data and thus functional principal component analysis is a natural\ntool to asses the quality of pedestrian flow models beyond average properties.\nIn this article we conduct functional PCA for the trajectories of pedestrians\npassing through a bottleneck. We benchmark two agent based models of pedestrian\nflow against the experimental data using PCA average and stochastic features.\nFunctional PCA proves to be an efficient tool to detect deviation between\nsimulation and experiment and to asses quality of pedestrian models.\n", "  Localized surface plasmons are confined collective oscillations of electrons\nin metallic nanoparticles. When driven by light, the optical response is\ndictated by geometrical parameters and the dielectric environment and plasmons\nare therefore extremely important for sensing applications. Plasmons in\ngraphene disks have the additional benefit to be highly tunable via electrical\nstimulation. Mechanical vibrations create structural deformations in ways where\nthe excitation of localized surface plasmons can be strongly modulated. We show\nthat the spectral shift in such a scenario is determined by a complex interplay\nbetween the symmetry and shape of the modal vibrations and the plasmonic mode\npattern. Tuning confined modes of light in graphene via acoustic excitations,\npaves new avenues in shaping the sensitivity of plasmonic detectors, and in the\nenhancement of the interaction with optical emitters, such as molecules, for\nfuture nanophotonic devices.\n", "  We give an informal summary of ongoing work which uses tools distilled from\nthe theory of fibre bundles to classify and connect invariant fields associated\nwith spin motion in storage rings. We mention four major theorems. One ties\ninvariant fields with the notion of normal form, the second allows comparison\nof different invariant fields and the two others tie the existence of invariant\nfields to the existence of certain invariant sets. We explain how the theorems\napply to the spin dynamics of spin-$1/2$ and spin-$1$ particles. Our approach\nelegantly unifies the spin-vector dynamics from the T-BMT equation with the\nspin-tensor dynamics and other dynamics and suggests an avenue for addressing\nthe question of the existence of the invariant spin field.\n", "  Transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (TMDs) appear in many\nscattering processes at high energy, from the semi-inclusive DIS experiments at\na few GeV to the Higgs transverse momentum distribution at the LHC. Predictions\nfor TMD observables crucially depend on TMD factorization, which in turn\ndetermines the TMD evolution of the observables with energy. In this\ncontribution to SPIN2014 TMD factorization is outlined, including a discussion\nof the treatment of the nonperturbative region, followed by a summary of\nresults on TMD evolution, mostly applied to azimuthal asymmetries.\n", "  In this paper we introduce and analyze an algorithm for continuous data\nassimilation for a three-dimensional Brinkman-Forchheimer-extended Darcy (3D\nBFeD) model of porous media. This model is believed to be accurate when the\nflow velocity is too large for Darcy's law to be valid, and additionally the\nporosity is not too small. The algorithm is inspired by ideas developed for\ndesigning finite-parameters feedback control for dissipative systems. It aims\nto obtaining improved estimates of the state of the physical system by\nincorporating deterministic or noisy measurements and observations.\nSpecifically, the algorithm involves a feedback control that nudges the large\nscales of the approximate solution toward those of the reference solution\nassociated with the spatial measurements. In the first part of the paper, we\npresent few results of existence and uniqueness of weak and strong solutions of\nthe 3D BFeD system. The second part is devoted to the setting and convergence\nanalysis of the data assimilation algorithm.\n", "  We report on the studies of Transverse-Momentum-Dependent distributions\n(TMDs) at a future fixed-target experiment --AFTER@LHC-- using the $p^+$ or Pb\nion LHC beams, which would be the most energetic fixed-target experiment ever\nperformed. AFTER@LHC opens new domains of particle and nuclear physics by\ncomplementing collider-mode experiments, in particular those of RHIC and the\nEIC projects. Both with an extracted beam by a bent crystal or with an internal\ngas target, the luminosity achieved by AFTER@LHC surpasses that of RHIC by up\nto 3 orders of magnitude. With an unpolarised target, it allows for\nmeasurements of TMDs such as the Boer-Mulders quark distributions and the\ndistribution of unpolarised and linearly polarised gluons in unpolarised\nprotons. Using polarised targets, one can access the quark and gluon Sivers\nTMDs through single transverse-spin asymmetries in Drell-Yan and quarkonium\nproduction. In terms of kinematics, the fixed-target mode combined with a\ndetector covering $\\eta_{\\rm lab} \\in [1,5]$ allows one to measure these\nasymmetries at large $x^\\uparrow$ in the polarised nucleon.\n", "  With Australia Telescope Compact Array observations, we detect a highly\nelongated Mpc-scale diffuse radio source on the eastern periphery of the Bullet\ncluster 1E0657-55.8, which we argue has the positional, spectral and\npolarimetric characteristics of a radio relic. This powerful relic (2.3+/-0.1 x\n10^25 W Hz^-1) consists of a bright northern bulb and a faint linear tail. The\nbulb emits 94% of the observed radio flux and has the highest surface\nbrightness of any known relic. Exactly coincident with the linear tail we find\na sharp X-ray surface brightness edge in the deep Chandra image of the cluster\n-- a signature of a shock front in the hot intracluster medium (ICM), located\non the opposite side of the cluster to the famous bow shock. This new example\nof an X-ray shock coincident with a relic further supports the hypothesis that\nshocks in the outer regions of clusters can form relics via diffusive shock\n(re-)acceleration. Intriguingly, our new relic suggests that seed electrons for\nreacceleration are coming from a local remnant of a radio galaxy, which we are\nlucky to catch before its complete disruption. If this scenario, in which a\nrelic forms when a shock crosses a well-defined region of the ICM polluted with\naged relativistic plasma -- as opposed to the usual assumption that seeds are\nuniformly mixed in the ICM -- is also the case for other relics, this may\nexplain a number of peculiar properties of peripheral relics.\n", "  Region-of-Interest (ROI) tomography aims at reconstructing a region of\ninterest $C$ inside a body using only x-ray projections intersecting $C$ with\nthe goal to reduce overall radiation exposure when only a small specific region\nof the body needs to be examined. We consider x-ray acquisition from sources\nlocated on a smooth curve $\\Gamma$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ verifying classical Tuy's\ncondition. In this situation, the {\\it non-trucated} cone-beam transform $D f$\nof smooth densities $f$ admits an explicit inverse $Z$; however $Z$ cannot\ndirectly reconstruct $f$ from ROI-truncated projections. To deal with the ROI\ntomography problem, we introduce a novel reconstruction approach. For densities\n$f$ in $L^{\\infty}(B)$ where $B$ is a bounded ball in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, our\nmethod iterates an operator $U$ combining ROI-truncated projections, inversion\nby the operator $Z$ and appropriate regularization operators. Assuming only\nknowledge of projections corresponding to a spherical ROI $C \\subset B$, given\n$\\epsilon >0$, we prove that if $C$ is sufficiently large our iterative\nreconstruction algorithm converges uniformly to an $\\epsilon$-accurate\napproximation of $f$, where the accuracy depends on the regularity of $f$\nquantified in the Sobolev norm $W^5(B)$. This result shows the existence of a\ncritical ROI radius ensuring the convergence of the ROI reconstruction\nalgorithm to $\\epsilon$-accurate approximations of $f$. We numerically verified\nthese theoretical results using simulated acquisition of ROI-truncated\ncone-beam projection data for multiple acquisition geometries. Numerical\nexperiments indicate that the critical ROI radius is fairly small with respect\nto the support region~$B$.\n", "  In the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark a left-right\nasymmetry, the Collins asymmetry, is expected for each hadron produced in the\nprocess $\\mu N \\rightarrow \\mu ' h^{+} h^{-} X$. Similarly, an asymmetry is\nalso expected for the hadron pair, the dihadron asymmetry. Both asymmetries\nhave been measured to be different from zero on transversely polarised proton\ntargets and have allowed for first extractions of the transversity\ndistributions. From the high statistics COMPASS data we have further\ninvestigated these asymmetries getting strong indications that the two\nmechanisms are driven by a common physical process.\n", "  The main goal of the present contribution is a pedagogical introduction to\nthe fascinating world of neutron stars by relying on relativistic density\nfunctional theory. Density functional theory provides a powerful--and perhaps\nunique--framework for the calculation of both the properties of finite nuclei\nand neutron stars. Given the enormous densities that may be reached in the core\nof neutron stars, it is essential that such theoretical framework incorporates\nfrom the outset the basic principles of Lorentz covariance and special\nrelativity. After a brief historical perspective, we present the necessary\ndetails required to compute the equation of state of dense, neutron-rich\nmatter. As the equation of state is all that is needed to compute the structure\nof neutron stars, we discuss how nuclear physics--particularly certain kind of\nlaboratory experiments--can provide significant constrains on the behavior of\nneutron-rich matter.\n", "  Recent experimental results suggest that metallic liquids universally exhibit\na high-temperature dynamical crossover, which is correlated with the glass\ntransition temperature ($T_{g}$). We demonstrate, using molecular dynamics\nresults for Cu64Zr36, that this temperature, $T_{A} \\approx 2 \\times T_{g}$, is\nlinked with cooperative atomic rearrangements that produce domains of connected\nicosahedra. Supercooling to a new characteristic temperature, $T_{D}$, is shown\nto produce higher order cooperative rearrangements amongst connected\nicosahedra, leading to large-scale domain fluctuations and the onset of glassy\ndynamics. These extensive domains then abruptly stabilize above $T_{g}$ and\neventually percolate before the glass is formed. All characteristic\ntemperatures ($T_{A}$, $T_{D}$ and $T_{g}$) are thus connected by successive\nmanifestations of the structural cooperativity that begins at $T_{A}$.\n", "  The study of a quasi back-to-back isolated pair made of a heavy quarkonium,\nsuch as a J/psi or a Upsilon, and a photon produced in proton-proton collisions\nat the LHC, is probably the optimal way to get right away a first experimental\ndetermination of two gluon transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs)\nin an unpolarized proton, f1^g and h1^perp,g the latter giving the distribution\nof linearly polarized gluons. To substantiate this, we calculate the\ntransverse-momentum-dependent effects that arise in the process under study and\ndiscuss the feasibility of their measurements.\n", "  A natural generalization of the binary XOR games to the class of XOR-d games\nwith $d > 2$ outcomes is studied. We propose an algebraic bound to the quantum\nvalue of these games and use it to derive several interesting properties of\nthese games. As an example, we re-derive in a simple manner a recently\ndiscovered bound on the quantum value of the CHSH-d game for prime $d$. It is\nshown that no total function XOR-d game with uniform inputs can be a\npseudo-telepathy game, there exists a quantum strategy to win the game only\nwhen there is a classical strategy also. We then study the principle of lack of\nquantum advantage in the distributed non-local computation of binary functions\nwhich is a well-known information-theoretic principle designed to pick out\nquantum correlations from amongst general no-signaling ones. We prove a\nlarge-alphabet generalization of this principle, showing that quantum theory\nprovides no advantage in the task of non-local distributed computation of a\nrestricted class of functions with $d$ outcomes for prime $d$, while general\nno-signaling boxes do. Finally, we consider the question whether there exist\ntwo-party tight Bell inequalities with no quantum advantage, and show that the\nbinary non-local computation game inequalities for the restricted class of\nfunctions are not facet defining for any number of inputs.\n", "  In the two papers published recently, we apply collinear expansion to both\ninclusive ($e^+ e^- \\to h+X$) and semi-inclusive ($e^+ e^- \\to h + \\bar q + X$)\nhadron production in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation to derive a formalism suitable for\na systematic study of leading as well as higher twist contributions to\nfragmentation functions at the tree level. We carry out the calculations for\nhadrons with spin-0, spin-1/2 as well as spin-1. This proceeding is mainly a\nsummary of these two papers.\n", "  We theoretically and numerically study Bogoliubov-wave turbulence in\nthree-dimensional atomic Bose-Einstein condensates with the Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation, investigating three spectra for the macroscopic wave function, the\ndensity distribution, and the Bogoliubov-wave distribution. In this turbulence,\nBogoliubov waves play an important role in the behavior of these spectra, so\nthat we call it Bogoliubov-wave turbulence. In a previous study [D. Proment\n\\textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. A \\textbf{80}, 051603(R) (2009)], a $-3/2$ power\nlaw in the spectrum for the macroscopic wave function was suggested by using\nweak wave turbulence theory, but we find that another $-7/2$ power law appears\nin both theoretical and numerical calculations. Furthermore, we focus on the\nspectrum for the density distribution, which can be observed in experiments,\ndiscussing the possibility of experimental observation. Through these\nanalytical and numerical calculations, we also demonstrate that the previously\nneglected condensate dynamics induced by the Bogoliubov waves is remarkably\nimportant.\n", "  Random Boolean networks (RBNs) are frequently employed for modelling complex\nsystems driven by information processing, e.g. for gene regulatory networks\n(GRNs). Here we propose a hierarchical adaptive RBN (HARBN) as a system\nconsisting of distinct adaptive RBNs - subnetworks - connected by a set of\npermanent interlinks. Information measures and internal subnetworks topology of\nHARBN coevolve and reach steady-states that are specific for a given network\nstructure. We investigate mean node information, mean edge information as well\nas a mean node degree as functions of model parameters and demonstrate HARBN's\nability to describe complex hierarchical systems.\n", "  This is intend to provide an overview of the theoretical and phenomenological\nparts of the TMD (Transverse Momentum Dependent parton distribution and\nfragmentation functions) studies. By comparing with the theoretical framework\nthat we have for the inclusive deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering and the\none-dimensional imaging of the nucleon, I try to outline what we need to do in\norder to construct a comprehensive theoretical framework for semi-inclusive\nreactions and the three dimensional imaging of the nucleon. After that, I try\nto give an overview of what we have already achieved and make an outlook for\nthe future.\n", "  We study measures of decoherence and thermalization of a quantum system $S$\nin the presence of a quantum environment (bath) $E$. The whole system is\nprepared in a canonical thermal state at a finite temperature. Applying\nperturbation theory with respect to the system-environment coupling strength,\nwe find that under common Hamiltonian symmetries, up to first order in the\ncoupling strength it is sufficient to consider the uncoupled system to predict\ndecoherence and thermalization measures of $S$. This decoupling allows closed\nform expressions for perturbative expansions for the measures of decoherence\nand thermalization in terms of the free energies of $S$ and of $E$. Numerical\nresults for both coupled and decoupled systems with up to 40 quantum spins\nvalidate these findings.\n", "  In Quantum Physics there are circumstances where the direct measurement of\nparticular observables encounters diffculties; in some of these cases, however,\nits value can be evaluated, i.e. it can be inferred by measuring another\nobservable characterized by perfect correlation with the observable of\ninterest. Though an evaluation is often interpreted as a measurement of the\nevaluated observable, we prove that the two concepts cannot be identified in\nQuantum Physics, because the identifcation yields contradictions. Then, we\nestablish the conceptual status of evaluations in Quantum Theory and the role\ncan be ascribed to them.\n", "  We have utilized time-domain magneto-terahertz spectroscopy to investigate\nthe low frequency optical response of topological insulator\nCu$_{0.02}$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Bi$_2$Se$_3$ films. With both field and frequency\ndependence, such experiments give sufficient information to measure the\nmobility and carrier density of multiple conduction channels simultaneously. We\nobserve sharp cyclotron resonances (CRs) in both materials. The small amount of\nCu incorporated into the Cu$_{0.02}$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ induces a true bulk insulator\nwith only a \\textit{single} type of conduction with total sheet carrier density\n$\\sim4.9\\times10^{12}/$cm$^{2}$ and mobility as high as 4000\ncm$^{2}/$V$\\cdot$s. This is consistent with conduction from two virtually\nidentical topological surface states (TSSs) on top and bottom of the film with\na chemical potential $\\sim$145 meV above the Dirac point and in the bulk gap.\nThe CR broadens at high fields, an effect that we attribute to an\nelectron-phonon interaction. This assignment is supported by an extended Drude\nmodel analysis of the zero field Drude conductance. In contrast, in normal\nBi$_2$Se$_3$ films two conduction channels were observed and we developed a\nself-consistent analysis method to distinguish the dominant TSSs and coexisting\ntrivial bulk/2DEG states. Our high-resolution Faraday rotation spectroscopy on\nCu$_{0.02}$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ paves the way for the observation of quantized Faraday\nrotation under experimentally achievable conditions to push chemical potential\nin the lowest Landau Level.\n", "  We investigate the use of the cross-correlation between galaxies and galaxy\ngroups to measure redshift-space distortions (RSD) and thus probe the growth\nrate of cosmological structure. This is compared to the classical approach\nbased on using galaxy auto-correlation. We make use of realistic simulated\ngalaxy catalogues that have been constructed by populating simulated dark\nmatter haloes with galaxies through halo occupation prescriptions. We adapt the\nclassical RSD dispersion model to the case of the group-galaxy\ncross-correlation function and estimate the RSD parameter $\\beta$ by fitting\nboth the full anisotropic correlation function $\\xi(r_p,\\pi)$ and its multipole\nmoments. In addition, we define a modified version of the latter statistics by\ntruncating the multipole moments to exclude strongly non-linear distortions at\nsmall transverse scales. We fit these three observable quantities in our set of\nsimulated galaxy catalogues and estimate statistical and systematic errors on\n$\\beta$ for the case of galaxy-galaxy, group-group, and group-galaxy\ncorrelation functions. When ignoring off-diagonal elements of the covariance\nmatrix in the fitting, the truncated multipole moments of the group-galaxy\ncross-correlation function provide the most accurate estimate, with systematic\nerrors below 3% when fitting transverse scales larger than $10Mpc/h$. Including\nthe full data covariance enlarges statistical errors but keep unchanged the\nlevel of systematic error. Although statistical errors are generally larger for\ngroups, the use of group-galaxy cross-correlation can potentially allow the\nreduction of systematics while using simple linear or dispersion models.\n", "  We investigate the wave optics in the Schwarzschild spacetime. Applying the\nstandard formalism of wave scattering problems, the Green function represented\nby the sum over the partial waves is evaluated using the Poisson sum formula.\nThe effect of orbiting scattering due to the unstable circular orbit for null\nrays is taken into account as the contribution of the Regge poles of the\nscattering matrix and the asymptotic form of the scattering wave is obtained in\nthe eikonal limit. Using this wave function, images of the black hole\nilluminated by a point source are reconstructed. We also discuss the wave\neffect in the frequency domain caused by the interference between the direct\nrays and the winding rays.\n", "  A sampling procedure for the transition matrix Monte Carlo method is\nintroduced that generates the density of states function over a wide parameter\nrange with minimal coding effort.\n", "  For a homogeneous system divisible into identical, weakly interacting\nsubsystems, the muticanonical procedure can be accelerated if it is first\napplied to determine of the density of states for a single subsystem. This\nresult is then employed to approximate the state density of a subsystem with\ntwice the size that forms the starting point of a new multicanonical iteration.\nSince this compound subsystem interacts less on average with its environment,\niterating this sequence of steps rapidly generates the state density of the\nfull system.\n", "  Being able to reliably track perturbations across bounces and turnarounds in\ncyclic and bouncing cosmology lies at the heart of being able to compare the\npredictions of these models with the Cosmic Microwave Background observations.\nThis has been a challenging task due to the unknown nature of the physics\ninvolved during the bounce as well as the technical challenge of matching\nperturbations precisely between the expansion and contraction phases. In this\npaper, we will present general techniques (analytical and numerical) that can\nbe applied to understand the physics of the fluctuations, especially those with\n\"long\" wavelengths, and test its validity in some simple bouncing/cyclic toy\nmodels where the physics is well understood. We will then apply our techniques\nto more interesting cosmological models such as the bounce inflation and cyclic\ninflation.\n", "  Supersymmetry transformations change the Lagrangian $\\mathscr{L}$ into a\ntotal derivative $\\delta \\mathscr{L} = \\partial_\\mu \\mathcal{V}^{\\mu}$. On\nmanifolds with boundaries the total derivative term is an obstruction to\npreserving supersymmetry. Such total derivative terms can be canceled by a\nboundary action without specifying boundary conditions, but only for a\nsubalgebra of supersymmetry. We study compensating boundary actions for\n$\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry in 4d, and show that they are determined\nindependently of the details of the theory and of the boundary conditions. Two\ndistinct classes of boundary actions exist, which correspond to preserving\neither a linear combination of supercharges of opposite chirality (called\nA-type) or supercharges of opposite chirality independently (B-type). The first\noption preserves a subalgebra isomorphic to $\\mathcal{N} = 1$ in 3d, while the\nsecond preserves only a 2d subgroup of the Lorentz symmetry and a subalgebra\nisomorphic to $\\mathcal{N} = (0,2)$ in 2d. These subalgebras are in one to one\ncorrespondence with half-BPS objects: the A-type corresponds to domain walls\nwhile the B-type corresponds to strings. We show that integrating the full\ncurrent algebra and taking into account boundary contributions leads to an\nenergy-momentum tensor which contains the boundary terms. The boundary terms\ncome from the domain wall and string currents in the two respective cases.\n", "  A precise calculation that translates shifts of X-ray K-absorption edges to\nvariations of thermodynamic properties allows quantitative characterization of\ninterior thermodynamic properties of warm dense plasmas by X-ray absorption\ntechniques, which provides essential information for inertial confinement\nfusion and other astrophysical applications. We show that this interpretation\ncan be achieved through an improved first-principles method. Our calculation\nshows that the shift of K-edges exhibits selective sensitivity to thermal\nparameters and thus would be a suitable temperature index to warm dense\nplasmas. We also show with a simple model that the shift of K-edges can be used\nto detect inhomogeneity inside warm dense plasmas when combined with other\nexperimental tools.\n", "  Electromagnetic effects are increasingly being accounted for in lattice\nquantum chromodynamics computations. Because of their long-range nature, they\nlead to large finite-size effects over which it is important to gain analytical\ncontrol. Nonrelativistic effective field theories provide an efficient tool to\ndescribe these effects. Here we argue that some care has to be taken when\napplying these methods to quantum electrodynamics in a finite volume.\n", "  The paper treats the validity problem of the nonrelativistic Vlasov-Poisson\nequation in $d\\geq 2$ dimensions. It is shown that the Vlasov-Poisson dynamics\ncan be derived as a combined mean field and point-particle limit of an\nN-particle Coulomb system of extended charges. This requires a sufficiently\nfast convergence of the initial empirical distributions. If the electron radius\ndecreases slower than $N^{-\\frac{1}{d(d+2)}}$, the corresponding initial\nconfigurations are typical. This result entails propagation of molecular chaos\nfor the respective dynamics\n", "  Free energies of molecules can be calculated by quantum computations or by\nnormal mode classical calculations. However, the first can be computationally\nimpractical for large molecules and the second is based on the assumption of\nharmonic dynamics. We present a novel, accurate and complete calculation of\nmolecular free energies in standard classical potentials. In this method we\ntransform the molecule by relaxing potential terms which depend on the\ncoordinates of a group of atoms in that molecule and calculate the free energy\ndifference associated with the transformation. Then, since the transformed\nmolecule can be treated as non interacting systems, the free energy associated\nwith these atoms is analytically or numerically calculated. This two-step\ncalculation can be applied to calculate free energies of molecules or free\nenergy difference between (possibly large) molecules in a general environment.\nWe suggest the potential application of free energy calculation of chemical\nreactions in classical molecular simulations.\n", "  With the assistance of a complex singlet, and an effective operator involving\nCP violations, the dark matter relic abundance and baryon asymmetry of the\nuniverse have been addressed simul- taneously. We studied the electroweak\nbaryogenesis mechanism systematically. The electroweak phase transition\nanalysis indicates that the strong first order phase transition takes place by\none- step or two-step type due to the dynamics of the energy gap between the\nelectroweak vacuum and the vacuum of the complex singlet. The relation between\nthe magnitude of baryon asymmetry of the universe and the phase transition type\nand strength has been explored in the framework of electroweak baryogenesis.\n", "  We address the question of determining the eigenvalues $\\lambda\\_n$ (listed\nin nondecreasing order, with multiplicities) for which Courant's nodal domain\ntheorem is sharp i.e., for which there exists an associated eigenfunction with\n$n$ nodal domains (Courant-sharp eigenvalues). Following ideas going back to\nPleijel (1956), we prove that the only Courant-sharp eigenvalues of the flat\nequilateral torus are the first and second, and that the only Courant-sharp\nDirichlet eigenvalues of the equilateral triangle are the first, second, and\nfourth eigenvalues. In the last section we sketch similar results for the\nright-angled isosceles triangle and for the hemiequilateral triangle.\n", "  The self-consistent proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation\napproach is employed to calculate $\\beta$-decay half-lives of neutron-rich\neven-even nuclei with $8\\leqslant Z \\leqslant 30$. A newly proposed nonlinear\npoint-coupling effective interaction PC-PK1 is used in the calculations. It is\nfound that the isoscalar proton-neutron pairing interaction can significantly\nreduce $\\beta$-decay half-lives. With an isospin-dependent isoscalar\nproton-neutron pairing strength, our results well reproduce the experimental\n$\\beta$-decay half-lives, although the pairing strength is not adjusted using\nthe half-lives calculated in this study.\n", "  Rotating neutron stars, or pulsars, are plausibly the source of power behind\nmany astrophysical systems, such as gamma-ray bursts, supernovae, pulsar wind\nnebulae and supernova remnants. In the past several years, 3D numerical\nsimulations made it possible to compute pulsar spindown luminosity from first\nprinciples and revealed that oblique pulsar winds are more powerful than\naligned ones. However, what causes this enhanced power output of oblique\npulsars is not understood. In this work, using time-dependent 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and force-free simulations, we show that, contrary to\nthe standard paradigm, the open magnetic flux, which carries the energy away\nfrom the pulsar, is laterally non-uniform. We argue that this non-uniformity is\nthe primary reason for the increased luminosity of oblique pulsars. To\ndemonstrate this, we construct simple analytic descriptions of aligned and\northogonal pulsar winds and combine them to obtain an accurate 3D description\nof the pulsar wind for any obliquity. Our approach describes both the warped\nmagnetospheric current sheet and the smooth variation of pulsar wind properties\noutside of it. We find that generically the magnetospheric current sheet\nseparates plasmas that move at mildly relativistic velocities relative to each\nother. This suggests that the magnetospheric reconnection is a type of driven,\nrather than free, reconnection. The jump in magnetic field components across\nthe current sheet decreases with increasing obliquity, which could be a\nmechanism that reduces dissipation in near-orthogonal pulsars. Our analytical\ndescription of the pulsar wind can be used for constructing models of pulsar\ngamma-ray emission, pulsar wind nebulae, and magnetar-powered core-collapse\ngamma-ray bursts and supernovae.\n", "  We encode the many-body wavefunction of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in\nthe $N$-particle sector of an extended catalytic state. This catalytic state is\na coherent state for the condensate mode and an arbitrary state for the modes\northogonal to the condensate mode. Going to a time-dependent interaction\npicture where the state of the condensate mode is displaced to the vacuum, we\ncan organize the effective Hamiltonian by powers of ${N}^{-1/2}$. Requiring the\nterms of order ${N}^{1/2}$ to vanish gives the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Going\nto the next order, $N^0$, we derive equations for the number-conserving\nBogoliubov approximation, first given by Castin and Dum [Phys. Rev. A\n$\\textbf{57}$, 3008 (1998)]. In contrast to other approaches, ours is well\nsuited to calculating the state evolution in the Schr\\\"{o}dinger picture;\nmoreover, it is straightforward to generalize our method to multi-component\nBECs and to higher-order corrections.\n", "  In this work we study the transition from normal to anomalous diffusion of\nBrownian particles on disordered potentials. The potential model consists of a\nseries of \"potential hills\" (defined on unit cell of constant length) whose\nheights are chosen randomly from a given distribution. We calculate the exact\nexpression for the diffusion coefficient in the case of uncorrelated potentials\nfor arbitrary distributions. We particularly show that when the potential\nheights have a Gaussian distribution (with zero mean and a finite variance) the\ndiffusion of the particles is always normal. In contrast when the distribution\nof the potential heights are exponentially distributed we show that the\ndiffusion coefficient vanishes when system is placed below a critical\ntemperature. We calculate analytically the diffusion exponent for the anomalous\n(subdiffusive) phase by using the so-called \"random trap model\". We test our\npredictions by means of Langevin simulations obtaining good agreement within\nthe accuracy of our numerical calculations.\n", "  We consider 1-D quasi-periodic Frenkel-Kontorova models.\n  We study the existence of equilibria whose frequency (i.e. the inverse of the\ndensity of deposited material) is resonant with the frequencies of the\nsubstratum.\n  We study perturbation theory for small potential. We show that there are\nperturbative expansions to all orders for the quasi-periodic equilibria with\nresonant frequencies. Under very general conditions, we show that there are at\nleast two such perturbative expansions for equilibria for small values of the\nparameter.\n  We also develop a dynamical interpretation of the equilibria in these\nquasi-periodic media. We show that equilibria are orbits of a dynamical system\nwhich has very unusual properties. We obtain results on the Lyapunov exponents\nof the dynamical systems, i.e. the phonon gap of the resonant quasi-periodic\nequilibria. We show that the equilibria can be pinned even if the gap is zero.\n", "  I review the current status of the determination of helicity-dependent, or\npolarized, parton distribution functions from a comprehensive analysis of\nexperimental data in perturbative quantum chromodynamics. I illustrate the\nlatest achievements driven by new measurements in polarized proton-proton\ncollisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, namely the first evidence of\na sizable polarized light sea quark asymmetry and of a positive polarized gluon\ndistribution in the proton. I discuss which are the open issues in the\ndetermination of polarized distributions, and how these may be addressed in the\nfuture by ongoing, planned and proposed experimental programs.\n", "  We prove that there exists a family of quantum systems that can be cooled to\ntheir ground states by a one-shot projective measurement on the ancillas\ncoupled to these systems. Consequently, this proof gives rise to the conditions\nfor achieving the one-shot measurement ground-state cooling (OSMGSC). We also\npropose a general procedure for finding unitary propagators and corresponding\nHamiltonians to realize such cooling by means of inverse engineering technique.\n", "  Recently the ATLAS experiment announced a 3 $\\sigma$ excess at the Z-peak\nconsisting of 29 pairs of leptons together with two or more jets, $E_T^{\\rm\nmiss}> 225$ GeV and $H_T \\geq 600$ GeV, to be compared with $10.6 \\pm 3.2$\nexpected lepton pairs in the Standard Model. No excess outside the Z-peak was\nobserved. By trying to explain this signal with SUSY we find that only\nrelatively light gluinos, $m_{\\tilde g} \\lesssim 1.2$ TeV, together with a\nheavy neutralino NLSP of $m_{\\tilde \\chi} \\gtrsim 400$ GeV decaying\npredominantly to Z-boson plus a light gravitino, such that nearly every gluino\nproduces at least one Z-boson in its decay chain, could reproduce the excess.\nWe construct an explicit general gauge mediation model able to reproduce the\nobserved signal overcoming all the experimental limits. Needless to say, more\nsophisticated models could also reproduce the signal, however, any model would\nhave to exhibit the following features, light gluinos, or heavy particles with\na strong production cross-section, producing at least one Z-boson in its decay\nchain. The implications of our findings for the Run II at LHC with the scaling\non the Z peak, as well as for the direct search of gluinos and other SUSY\nparticles, are pointed out.\n", "  Connections with (skew-symmetric) torsion on non-symmetric Riemannian\nmanifold satisfying the Einstein metricity condition (NGT with torsion) are\nconsidered. It is shown that an almost Hermitian manifold is an NGT with\ntorsion if and only if it is a Nearly K\\\"ahler manifold. In the case of an\nalmost contact metric manifold the NGT with torsion spaces are characterized\nand a possibly new class of almost contact metric manifolds is extracted.\nSimilar considerations lead to a definition of a particular classes of almost\npara-Hermitian and almost paracontact metric manifolds. The conditions are\ngiven in terms of the corresponding Nijenhuis tensors and the exterior\nderivative of the skew-symmetric part of the non-symmetric Riemannian metric.\n", "  Optically trapped nanoparticles have recently emerged as exciting candidates\nfor tests of quantum mechanics at the macroscale and as versatile platforms for\nultrasensitive metrology. Recent experiments have demonstrated parametric\nfeedback cooling, nonequilibrium physics, and temperature detection, all in the\nclassical regime. Here we provide the first quantum model for trapped\nnanoparticle cooling and force sensing. In contrast to existing theories, our\nwork indicates that the nanomechanical ground state may be prepared without\nusing an optical resonator; that the cooling mechanism corresponds to nonlinear\nfriction; and that the energy loss during cooling is nonexponential in time.\nOur results show excellent agreement with experimental data in the classical\nlimit, and constitute an underlying theoretical framework for experiments\naiming at ground state preparation. Our theory also addresses the optimization\nof, and the fundamental quantum limit to, force sensing, thus providing\ntheoretical direction to ongoing searches for ultra-weak forces using levitated\nnanoparticles.\n", "  Accurate measurements of nuclear reactions of astrophysical interest within,\nor close to, the Gamow peak, show evidence of an unexpected effect attributed\nto the presence of atomic electrons in the target. The experiments need to\ninclude an effective \"screening\" potential to explain the enhancement of the\ncross sections at the lowest measurable energies. Despite various theoretical\nstudies conducted over the past 20 years and numerous experimental\nmeasurements, a theory has not yet been found that can explain the cause of the\nexceedingly high values of the screening potential needed to explain the data.\nIn this letter we show that instead of an atomic physics solution of the\n\"electron screening puzzle\", the reason for the large screening potential\nvalues is in fact due to clusterization effects in nuclear reactions, in\nparticular for reaction involving light nuclei.\n", "  We consider a system of three interacting van der Pol oscillators with\nreactive coupling. Phase equations are derived, using proper order of expansion\nover the coupling parameter. The dynamics of the system is studied by means of\nthe bifurcation analysis and with the method of Lyapunov exponent charts.\nEssential and physically meaningful features of the reactive coupling are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Physical potentials are routinely approximated to harmonic potentials so as\nto analytically solve the system dynamics. Often it is important to know when a\nquantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) behaves quantum mechanically and when\nclassically. Recently Su et. al. [Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 85}, 052126 (2012)] have\ntheoretically shown that QHO exhibits quantum contextuality (QC) for a certain\nset of pseudospin observables. In this work, we encode the four eigenstates of\na QHO onto four Zeeman product states of a pair of spin-1/2 nuclei. Using the\ntechniques of NMR quantum information processing, we then demonstrate the\nviolation of a state-dependent inequality arising from the noncontextual hidden\nvariable model, under specific experimental arrangements. We also\nexperimentally demonstrate the violation of a state-independent inequality by\nthermal equilibrium states of nuclear spins, thereby assessing their\nquantumness.\n", "  Exact solutions of the Dirac equation in external electromagnetic background\nfields are very helpful for understanding non-perturbative phenomena in quantum\nelectrodynamics (QED). However, for the limited set of known solutions, the\nfield often depends on one coordinate only, which could be the time $t$, a\nspatial coordinate such as $x$ or $r$, or a light-cone coordinate such as\n$ct-x$. By swapping the roles of known and unknown quantities in the Dirac\nequation, we are able to generate families of solutions of the Dirac equation\nin the presence of genuinely space-time dependent electromagnetic fields in\n$1+1$ and $2+1$ dimensions.\n", "  Inspired by the discovery of quantum hall effect and topological insulator,\ntopological properties of classical waves start to draw worldwide attention.\nTopological non-trivial bands characterized by non-zero Chern numbers are\nrealized with external magnetic field induced time reversal symmetry breaking\nor dynamic modulation. Due to the absence of Faraday-like effect, the breaking\nof time reversal symmetry in an acoustic system is commonly realized with\nmoving background fluids, and hence drastically increases the engineering\ncomplexity. Here we show that we can realize effective inversion symmetry\nbreaking and effective gauge field in a reduced two-dimensional system by\nstructurally engineering interlayer couplings, achieving an acoustic analog of\nthe topological Haldane model. We then find and demonstrate unidirectional\nbackscattering immune edge states. We show that the synthetic gauge field is\nclosely related to the Weyl points in the three-dimensional band structure.\n", "  Energy is in general not conserved for mechanical nonholonomic systems with\naffine constraints. In this article we point out that, nevertheless, in certain\ncases, there is a modification of the energy that is conserved. Such a function\ncoincides with the energy of the system relative to a different reference\nframe, in which the constraint is linear. After giving sufficient conditions\nfor this to happen, we point out the role of symmetry in this mechanism.\nLastly, we apply these ideas to prove that the motions of a heavy homogeneous\nsolid sphere that rolls inside a convex surface of revolution in uniform\nrotation about its vertical figure axis, are (at least for certain parameter\nvalues and in open regions of the phase space) quasi-periodic on tori of\ndimension up to three.\n", "  Anderson localization is known to be inevitable in one dimension for generic\ndisordered models. Since localization leads to Poissonian energy level\nstatistics, we ask if localized systems possess \"additional\" integrals of\nmotion as well, so as to enhance the analogy with quantum integrable systems.\nWe answer this in the affirmative in the present work. We construct a set of\nnontrivial integrals of motion for Anderson localized models, in terms of the\noriginal creation and annihilation operators. These are found as a power series\nin the hopping parameter. The recently found Type-1 Hamiltonians, which are\nknown to be quantum integrable in a precise sense, motivate our construction.\nWe note that these models can be viewed as disordered electron models with\ninfinite-range hopping, where a similar series truncates at the linear order.\nWe show that despite the infinite range hopping, all states but one are\nlocalized. We also study the conservation laws for the disorder free\nAubry-Andre model, where the states are either localized or extended, depending\non the strength of a coupling constant. We formulate a specific procedure for\naveraging over disorder, in order to examine the convergence of the power\nseries. Using this procedure in the Aubry-Andre model, we show that integrals\nof motion given by our construction are well-defined in localized phase, but\nnot so in the extended phase. Finally, we also obtain the integrals of motion\nfor a model with interactions to lowest order in the interaction.\n", "  The one-band Hubbard model on the pyrochlore lattice contains an extended\nquantum spin-liquid phase formed from the manifold of singlet dimer coverings.\nWe demonstrate that the massive and deconfined spinon excitations of this\nsystem have fermionic statistics. Holonic quasiparticles introduced by doping\nare also fermions and we explain the origin of this counterintuitive result.\n", "  We study the 2d N = 4 gauge theory descriptions of little strings on type II\nNS5- branes. The IIB strings on N NS5-branes are described by the N = (4,4)\ngauge theories, whose Higgs branch CFTs on U(N) instanton moduli spaces are\nrelevant. The IIA strings are described by N = (4,4) circular A_{N-1} quiver\ntheories, whose Coulomb branch CFTs are relevant. We study new N = (0,4) quiver\ngauge theories for the IIA strings, which make it easier to study some infrared\nobservables. In particular, we show that the elliptic genera of the IIA / IIB\nstrings precisely map to each other by T-duality.\n", "  Non-local pairing processes at the edge of a two-dimensional topological\ninsulator in proximity to an $s$-wave superconductor are usually suppressed by\nhelicity. However, additional proximity of a ferromagnetic insulator can\nsubstantially influence the helical constraint and therefore open a new\nconduction channel by allowing for crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) processes.\nWe show a one-to-one correspondence between CAR and the emergence of\nodd-frequency triplet superconductivity. Hence, non-local transport experiments\nthat identify CAR in helical liquids yield smoking-gun evidence for\nunconventional superconductivity. Interestingly, we identify a setup --\ncomposed of a superconductor flanked by two ferromagnetic insulators -- that\nallows us to favor CAR over electron cotunneling which is known to be a\ndifficult but essential task to be able to measure CAR.\n", "  We use polarization- and temperature-dependent x-ray absorption spectroscopy,\nin combination with photoelectron microscopy, x-ray diffraction and electronic\ntransport measurements, to study the driving force behind the insulator-metal\ntransition in VO2. We show that both the collapse of the insulating gap and the\nconcomitant change in crystal symmetry in homogeneously strained\nsingle-crystalline VO2 films are preceded by the purely-electronic softening of\nCoulomb correlations within V-V singlet dimers. This process starts 7 K (+/-\n0.3 K) below the transition temperature, as conventionally defined by\nelectronic transport and x-ray diffraction measurements, and sets the energy\nscale for driving the near-room-temperature insulator-metal transition in this\ntechnologically-promising material.\n", "  We study the Large $N$ dynamics of the $O(N)$ field theory in the Thermo\nfield dynamics approach. The question of recovering the high temperature phase\nand the corresponding $O(N)$ gauging is clarified. Through the associated\nbi-local representation we discuss the emergent bulk space-time and\nconstruction of (Higher spin) fields. We note the presence of `evanescent'\nmodes in this construction and also the mixing of spins at finite temperature.\n", "  Rotating small AdS black holes exhibit the superradiant instability to\nlow-frequency scalar perturbations, which is amenable to a complete analytic\ndescription in four dimensions. In this paper, we extend this description to\nall higher dimensions, focusing on slowly rotating charged AdS black holes with\na single angular momentum. We divide the spacetime of these black holes into\nthe near-horizon and far regions and find solutions to the scalar wave equation\nin each of these regions. Next, we perform the matching of these solutions in\nthe overlap between the regions, by employing the idea that the orbital quantum\nnumber $ \\ell $ can be thought of as an approximate integer. Thus, we obtain\nthe complete low-frequency solution that allows us to calculate the complex\nfrequency spectrum of quasinormal modes, whose imaginary part is determined by\na small damping parameter. Finally, we find a remarkably instructive expression\nfor the damping parameter, which appears to be a complex quantity in general.\nWe show that the real part of the damping parameter can be used to give a {\\it\nuniversal} analytic description of the superradiant instability for slowly\nrotating charged AdS black holes in all spacetime dimensions.\n", "  Spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) is studied in metallic bilayers that\nconsist of heavy metal (HM) layer and a ferromagnetic metal (FM) layer. We find\nnearly a ten-fold increase of SMR in W/CoFeB compared to previously studied\nHM/ferromagnetic insulator (FI) systems. The SMR increases with decreasing\ntemperature despite the negligible change in the W layer resistivity with\ntemperature. A model is developed to account for the absorption of the\nlongitudinal spin current to the FM layer, one of the key characteristics of a\nmetallic ferromagnet. We find that the model not only quantitatively describes\nthe HM layer thickness dependence of SMR, allowing accurate estimation of the\nspin Hall angle and the spin diffusion length of the HM layer, but also can\naccount for the temperature dependence of SMR by assuming a temperature\ndependent spin polarization of the FM layer. These results illustrate the\nunique role a metallic ferromagnetic layer plays in defining spin transmission\nacross the HM/FM interface.\n", "  We present an algorithm to express Wilson lines that are defined on piecewise\nlinear paths in function of their individual segments, reducing the number of\ndiagrams needed to be calculated. The important step lies in the observation\nthat different linear path topologies can be related to each other using their\ncolor structure. This framework allows one to easily switch results between\ndifferent Wilson line topologies, which is helpful when testing different\nstructures against each other.\n", "  The density and temperature dependence of the nuclear symmetry free energy is\ninvestigated using microscopic two- and three-body nuclear potentials\nconstructed from chiral effective field theory. The nuclear force models and\nmany-body methods are benchmarked to properties of isospin-symmetric nuclear\nmatter in the vicinity of the saturation density as well as the virial\nexpansion of the neutron matter equation of state at low fugacities. The free\nenergy per particle of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter is calculated assuming\na quadratic dependence of the interaction contributions on the isospin\nasymmetry. The spinodal instability at subnuclear densities is examined in\ndetail.\n", "  In this paper, we discuss a voting model by considering three different kinds\nof networks: a random graph, the Barab\\'{a}si-Albert(BA) model, and a fitness\nmodel. A voting model represents the way in which public perceptions are\nconveyed to voters. Our voting model is constructed by using two types of\nvoters--herders and independents--and two candidates. Independents conduct\nvoting based on their fundamental values; on the other hand, herders base their\nvoting on the number of previous votes. Hence, herders vote for the majority\ncandidates and obtain information relating to previous votes from their\nnetworks. We discuss the difference between the phases on which the networks\ndepend. Two kinds of phase transitions, an information cascade transition and a\nsuper-normal transition, were identified. The first of these is a transition\nbetween a state in which most voters make the correct choices and a state in\nwhich most of them are wrong. The second is a transition of convergence speed.\nThe information cascade transition prevails when herder effects are stronger\nthan the super-normal transition. In the BA and fitness models, the critical\npoint of the information cascade transition is the same as that of the random\nnetwork model. However, the critical point of the super-normal transition\ndisappears when these two models are used. In conclusion, the influence of\nnetworks is shown to only affect the convergence speed and not the information\ncascade transition. We are therefore able to conclude that the influence of\nhubs on voters' perceptions is limited.\n", "  We present a novel quantum algorithm for classification of images. The\nalgorithm is constructed using principal component analysis and von Neuman\nquantum measurements. In order to apply the algorithm we present a new quantum\nrepresentation of grayscale images.\n", "  A theory of fractional kinetics of glial cancer cells is presented. A role of\nthe migration-proliferation dichotomy in the fractional cancer cell dynamics in\nthe outer-invasive zone is discussed an explained in the framework of a\ncontinuous time random walk. The main suggested model is based on a\nconstruction of a 3D comb model, where the migration-proliferation dichotomy\nbecomes naturally apparent and the outer-invasive zone of glioma cancer is\nconsidered as a fractal composite with a fractal dimension $\\frD<3$.\n", "  We introduce the recently developed IR-improved DGLAP-CS theory into the\nshowers in Pythia8, as this Monte Carlo event generator is in wide use at LHC.\nWe show that, just as it was true in the IR-improved shower Monte Carlo\nHerwiri, which realizes the IR-improved DGLAP-CS theory in the Herwig6.5\nenvironment, the soft limit in processes such as single heavy gauge boson\nproduction is now more physical in the IR-improved DGLAP-CS theory version of\nPythia8. This opens the way to one's getting a comparison between the actual\ndetector simulations for some of the LHC experiments between IR-improved and\nunimproved showers as Pythia8 is used in detector simulations at LHC whereas\nHerwig6.5, the environment of the only other IR-improved DGLAP-CS QCD MC in the\nliterature, Herwiri1.031, is not any longer so used. Our achieving the\navailability of the IR-improved DGLAP-CS Pythia8 then is an important step in\nthe further development of the LHC precision theory program under development\nby the author and his collaborators.\n", "  Successful realization of polarized Drell-Yan physics program is one of the\nmain goals of the second stage of the COMPASS experiment. Drell-Yan\nmeasurements with high energy (190 GeV/c) pion beam and transversely polarized\nNH3 target have been initiated by a pilot-run in the October 2014 and will be\nfollowed by 140 days of data taking in 2015. In the past twelve years COMPASS\nexperiment performed series of SIDIS measurements with high energy muon beam\nand transversely polarized deuteron and proton targets. Results obtained for\nSivers effect and other target transverse spin dependent and unpolarized\nazimuthal asymmetries in SIDIS serve as an important input for general\nunderstanding of spin-structure of the nucleon and are being used in numerous\ntheoretical and phenomenological studies being carried out in the field of\ntransvers-spin physics. Measurement of the Sivers and all other azimuthal\neffects in polarized Drell-Yan at COMPASS will reveal another side of the\nspin-puzzle providing a link between SIDIS and Drell-Yan branches. This will be\na unique possibility to test universality and key-features of transverse\nmomentum dependent distribution functions (TMD PDFs) using essentially same\nexperimental setup and exploring same kinematic domain. In this review man\nphysics aspects of future COMPASS polarized Drell-Yan measurement of azimuthal\ntransverse spin asymmetries will be presented, giving a particular emphasis on\nthe link with very recent COMPASS results obtained for SIDIS transverse spin\nasymmetries from four \"Drell-Yan\" $Q^2$-ranges.\n", "  Radiative heat transport between materials supporting surface-phonon\npolaritons is greatly enhanced when the materials are placed at sub-wavelength\nseparation as a result of the contribution of near-field surface modes.\nHowever, the enhancement is limited to small separations due to the evanescent\ndecay of the surface waves. In this work, we propose and numerically\ndemonstrate an active scheme to extract these modes to the far-field. Our\napproach exploits the monochromatic nature of near-field thermal radiation to\ndrive a transition in a laser gain medium, which, when coupled with external\noptical pumping, allows the resonant surface mode to be emitted into the\nfar-field. Our study demonstrates a new approach to manipulate thermal\nradiation that could find applications in thermal management.\n", "  We report low-temperature thermal conductivity $\\kappa$ of pyrochlore\nYb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, which contains frustrated spin-ice correlations with\nsignificant quantum fluctuations. In the disordered spin-liquid regime,\n$\\kappa(H)$ exhibits a nonmonotonic magnetic field dependence, which is well\nexplained by the strong spin-phonon scattering and quantum monopole\nexcitations. We show that the excitation energy of quantum monopoles is\nstrongly suppressed from that of dispersionless classical monopoles. Moreover,\nin stark contrast to the diffusive classical monopoles, the quantum monopoles\nhave a very long mean free path. We infer that the quantum monopole is a novel\nheavy particle, presumably boson, which is highly mobile in a three-dimensional\nspin liquid.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate that it is impossible to simulate quantum\nbipartite correlations with a deterministic universal Turing machine. Our\napproach is based on the Normalized Information Distance (NID) that allows the\ncomparison of two pieces of data without detailed knowledge about their origin.\nUsing NID, we derive an inequality for output of two local deterministic\nuniversal Turing machines with correlated inputs. This inequality is violated\nby correlations generated by a maximally entangled polarization state of two\nphotons. The violation is shown using a freely available lossless compression\nprogram. The presented technique may allow to complement the common statistical\ninterpretation of quantum physics by an algorithmic one.\n", "  In this note, we discuss the implications of the weak gravity conjecture\n(WGC) for general models of large-field inflation with a large number of axions\n$N$. We first show that, from the bottom-up perspective, such models admit a\nvariety of different regimes for the enhancement of the effective axion decay\nconstant, depending on the amount of alignment and the number of instanton\nterms that contribute to the scalar potential. This includes regimes of no\nenhancement, power-law enhancement and exponential enhancement with respect to\n$N$. As special cases, we recover the Pythagorean enhancement of $N$-flation,\nthe $N$ and $N^{3/2}$ enhancements derived by Bachlechner, Long and McAllister\nand the exponential enhancement by Choi, Kim and Yun. We then analyze which\ntop-down constraints are put on such models from the requirement of consistency\nwith quantum gravity. In particular, the WGC appears to imply that the\nenhancement of the effective axion decay constant must not grow parametrically\nwith $N$ for $N \\gg 1$. On the other hand, recent works proposed that axions\nmight be able to violate this bound under certain circumstances. Our general\nexpression for the enhancement allows us to translate this possibility into a\ncondition on the number of instantons that couple to the axions. We argue that,\nat large $N$, models consistent with quantum gravity must either allow\nsuper-Planckian field excursions or have an enormous, possibly even\nexponentially large, number of dominant instanton terms in the scalar\npotential.\n", "  We present practical methods to measure entanglement for quantum simulators\nthat can be realized with trapped ions, cold atoms, and superconducting qubits.\nFocussing on long- and short-range Ising-type Hamiltonians, we introduce\nschemes that are applicable under realistic experimental conditions including\nmixedness due to, e.g., noise or temperature. In particular, we identify a\nsingle observable whose expectation value serves as a lower bound to\nentanglement and which may be obtained by a simple quantum circuit. As such\ncircuits are not (yet) available for every platform, we investigate the\nperformance of routinely measured observables as quantitative entanglement\nwitnesses. Possible applications include experimental studies of entanglement\nscaling in critical systems and the reliable benchmarking of quantum\nsimulators.\n", "  The concept of All-Back-Schottky-Contact (ABSC) thin-film photovoltaic\ndevices is introduced and evaluated using 2D numerical simulation. The built-in\nfield is generated by reach-through Schottky junctions with two metals of\ndifferent work functions in an alternating, side-by-side pattern along the back\nof the device. This approach minimizes the number of interfaces through which\ncharge transport is required while eliminating the need for transparent\nconductive front contacts, pn junctions, and scribing. Performance metrics are\ncalculated for a range of design parameters and it is shown that passivation of\nthe front surface and back contacts is critical to achieve efficiencies near\n20% using only one layer of material deposited on the back contacts. This\ndesign paradigm may afford a wide range of passivation materials since both\nelectrical conduction and optical transparency would not be required of any one\npassivation layer.\n", "  Structural symmetry breaking in magnetic materials is responsible for a\nvariety of outstanding physical phenomena. Examples range from the existence of\nmultiferroics, to current induced spin orbit torques (SOT) and the formation of\ntopological magnetic structures. In this letter we bring into light a novel\neffect of the structural inversion asymmetry (SIA): a chiral damping mechanism.\nThis phenomenon is evidenced by measuring the field driven domain wall (DW)\nmotion in perpendicularly magnetized asymmetric Pt/Co/Pt trilayers. The\ndifficulty in evidencing the chiral damping is that the ensuing DW dynamics\nexhibit identical spatial symmetry to those expected from the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Despite this fundamental resemblance,\nthe two scenarios are differentiated by their time reversal properties: while\nDMI is a conservative effect that can be modeled by an effective field, the\nchiral damping is purely dissipative and has no influence on the equilibrium\nmagnetic texture. When the DW motion is modulated by an in-plane magnetic\nfield, it reveals the structure of the internal fields experienced by the DWs,\nallowing to distinguish the physical mechanism. The observation of the chiral\ndamping, not only enriches the spectrum of physical phenomena engendered by the\nSIA, but since it can coexists with DMI it is essential for conceiving DW and\nskyrmion devices.\n", "  We study the finite density phase transition in the lattice QCD at real\nchemical potential. We adopt canonical approach and the canonical partition\nfunction is constructed for Nf=2 QCD. After derivation of the canonical\npartition function we calculate observables like the pressure, the quark number\ndensity, its second cumulant and the chiral condensate as a function of the\nreal chemical potential. We covered a wide range of temperature region starting\nfrom the confining low to the deconfining high temperature. We observe signals\nfor the deconfinement and the chiral restoration phase transition at real\nchemical potential below Tc starting from the confining phase.\n", "  We review recent progress in the construction of modified gravity models as\nalternatives to dark energy as well as the development of cosmological tests of\ngravity. Einstein's theory of General Relativity (GR) has been tested\naccurately within the local universe i.e. the Solar System, but this leaves the\npossibility open that it is not a good description of gravity at the largest\nscales in the Universe. This being said, the standard model of cosmology\nassumes GR on all scales. In 1998, astronomers made the surprising discovery\nthat the expansion of the Universe is accelerating, not slowing down. This\nlate-time acceleration of the Universe has become the most challenging problem\nin theoretical physics. Within the framework of GR, the acceleration would\noriginate from an unknown dark energy. Alternatively, it could be that there is\nno dark energy and GR itself is in error on cosmological scales. In this\nreview, we first give an overview of recent developments in modified gravity\ntheories including $f(R)$ gravity, braneworld gravity, Horndeski theory and\nmassive/bigravity theory. We then focus on common properties these models\nshare, such as screening mechanisms they use to evade the stringent Solar\nSystem tests. Once armed with a theoretical knowledge of modified gravity\nmodels, we move on to discuss how we can test modifications of gravity on\ncosmological scales. We present tests of gravity using linear cosmological\nperturbations and review the latest constraints on deviations from the standard\n$\\Lambda$CDM model. Since screening mechanisms leave distinct signatures in the\nnon-linear structure formation, we also review novel astrophysical tests of\ngravity using clusters, dwarf galaxies and stars.\n", "  We present a new pseudospectral code, bamps, for numerical relativity written\nwith the evolution of collapsing gravitational waves in mind. We employ the\nfirst order generalized harmonic gauge formulation. The relevant theory is\nreviewed and the numerical method is critically examined and specialized for\nthe task at hand. In particular we investigate formulation parameters, gauge\nand constraint preserving boundary conditions well-suited to non-vanishing\ngauge source functions. Different types of axisymmetric twist-free moment of\ntime symmetry gravitational wave initial data are discussed. A treatment of the\naxisymmetric apparent horizon condition is presented with careful attention to\nregularity on axis. Our apparent horizon finder is then evaluated in a number\nof test cases. Moving on to evolutions, we investigate modifications to the\ngeneralized harmonic gauge constraint damping scheme to improve conservation in\nthe strong field regime. We demonstrate strong-scaling of our pseudospectral\npenalty code. We employ the Cartoon method to efficiently evolve axisymmetric\ndata in our 3+1 dimensional code. We perform test evolutions of Schwarzschild\nperturbed by gravitational waves and by gauge pulses, both to demonstrate the\nuse of our blackhole excision scheme and for comparison with earlier results.\nFinally numerical evolutions of supercritical Brill waves are presented to\ndemonstrate durability of the excision scheme for the dynamical formation of a\nblackhole.\n", "  The geometric phase acquired by the vector states under an adiabatic\nevolution along a noncyclic path can be calculated correctly in any\ninstantaneous basis of a Hamiltonian that varies in time due to a\ntime-dependent classical field.\n", "  Graphene monolayers are known to display domains of anisotropic friction with\ntwofold symmetry and anisotropy exceeding 200 percent. This anisotropy has been\nthought to originate from periodic nanoscale ripples in the graphene sheet,\nwhich enhance puckering around a sliding asperity to a degree determined by the\nsliding direction. Here we demonstrate that these frictional domains derive not\nfrom structural features in the graphene, but from self-assembly of atmospheric\nadsorbates into a highly regular superlattice of stripes with period 4 to 6 nm.\nThe stripes and resulting frictional domains appear on monolayer and multilayer\ngraphene on a variety of substrates, as well as on exfoliated flakes of\nhexagonal boron nitride. We show that the stripe-superlattices can be\nreproducibly and reversibly manipulated with submicron precision using a\nscanning probe microscope, allowing us to create arbitrary arrangements of\nfrictional domains within a single flake. Our results suggest a revised\nunderstanding of the anisotropic friction observed in graphene and bulk\ngraphite in terms of atmospheric adsorbates.\n", "  Spin-physics projects at J-PARC are explained by including future\npossibilities. J-PARC is the most-intense hadron-beam facility in the\nhigh-energy region above multi-GeV, and spin physics will be investigated by\nusing secondary beams of kaons, pions, neutrinos, muons, and antiproton as well\nas the primary-beam proton. In particle physics, spin topics are on muon $g-2$,\nmuon and neutron electric dipole moments, and time-reversal violation\nexperiment in a kaon decay. Here, we focus more on hadron-spin physics as for\nfuture projects. For example, generalized parton distributions (GPDs) could be\ninvestigated by using pion and proton beams, whereas they are studied by the\nvirtual Compton scattering at lepton facilities. The GPDs are key quantities\nfor determining the three-dimensional picture of hadrons and for finding the\norigin of the nucleon spin including partonic orbital-angular-momentum\ncontributions. In addition, polarized parton distributions and various hadron\nspin topics should be possible by using the high-momentum beamline. The\nstrangeness contribution to the nucleon spin could be also investigated in\nprinciple with the neutrino beam with a near detector facility.\n", "  In this study we analyze the phase and group velocity of three-dimensional\nlinear traveling waves in two sheared flows, the plane channel and the wake\nflows. This was carried out by varying the wave number over a large interval of\nvalues at a given Reynolds number inside the ranges 20-100, 1000-8000, for the\nwake and channel flow, respectively. Evidence is given about the possible\npresence of both dispersive and non-dispersive effects which are associated\nwith the long and short ranges of wavelength. We solved the Orr-Sommerfeld and\nSquire eigenvalue problem and observed the least stable mode. It is evident\nthat, at low wave numbers, the least stable eigenmodes in the left branch of\nthe spectrum beave in a dispersive manner. By contrast, if the wavenumber is\nabove a specific threshold, a sharp dispersive to non-dispersive transition can\nbe observed. Beyond this transition, the dominant mode belongs to the right\nbranch of the spectrum. The transient behavior of the phase velocity of small\nthree-dimensional traveling waves was also considered. Having chosen the\ninitial conditions, we then show that the shape of the transient highly depends\non the transition wavelength threshold value. We show that the phase velocty\ncan oscillate with a frequency which is equal to the frequency width of the\neigenvalue spectrum. Furthermore, evidence of intermediate self-similarity is\ngiven for the perturbation field.\n", "  We have observed the effect of the Aharonov-Casher (AC) interference on the\nspectrum of a superconducting system containing a symmetric Cooper pair box\n(CPB) and a large inductance. By varying the charge $n_{g}$ induced on the CPB\nisland, we observed oscillations of the device spectrum with the period $\\Delta\nn_{g}=2e$. These oscillations are attributed to the charge-controlled AC\ninterference between the fluxon tunneling processes in the CPB Josephson\njunctions. Total suppression of the tunneling (complete destructive\ninterference) has been observed for the charge $n_{g}=e(2n+1)$. The CPB in this\nregime represents the $4\\pi$-periodic Josephson element, which can be used for\nthe development of the parity-protected superconducting qubits.\n", "  We study a mass splitting of light vector, axial-vector and pseudoscalar\nmesons in isospin medium in the framework of hard-wall model. We write an\neffective mass definition for the interacting gauge fields and scalar field\nintroduced in gauge field theory in the bulk of AdS space-time. Relying on\nholographic duality we obtain a formula for the effective mass of a boundary\nmeson in terms of derivative operator over the extra bulk coordinate. The\neffective mass found in this way coincides with the one obtained from finding\nof poles of the two-point correlation function. In order to avoid introducing\ndistinguished infrared boundaries in the quantisation formula for the different\nmesons from the same isotriplet we introduce extra action terms at this\nboundary, which reduces distinguished values of this boundary to the same\nvalue. Profile function solutions and effective mass expressions were found for\nthe in-medium $\\rho$, $a_1$ and $\\pi$ mesons.\n", "  The s-wave interaction of $\\bar{D} \\Lambda_c, \\bar{D} \\Sigma_c, \\bar{D}\n\\Lambda_c, \\bar{D}{}^* \\Sigma_c$ and $\\bar{D}\\Sigma^*_c,\n\\bar{D}{}^*\\Sigma^*_c$, is studied within a unitary coupled channels scheme\nwith the extended local hidden gauge approach. In addition to the\nWeinberg-Tomozawa term, several additional diagrams via the pion-exchange are\nalso taken into account as box potentials. Furthermore, in order to implement\nthe full coupled channels calculation, some of the box potentials which mix the\nvector-baryon and pseudoscalar-baryon sectors are extended to construct the\neffective transition potentials. As a result, we have observed six possible\nstates in several angular momenta. Four of them correspond to two pairs of\nadmixture states, two of $\\bar{D}\\Sigma_c$ - $\\bar{D}{}^*\\Sigma_c$ with $J^P =\n1/2^-$, and two of $\\bar{D}\\Sigma^*_c$ - $\\bar{D}{}^*\\Sigma^*_c$ with $J^P =\n3/2^-$. Moreover, we find a $\\bar{D}{}^* \\Sigma_c$ resonance which couples to\nthe $\\bar{D}\\Lambda_c$ channel and one spin degenerated bound state of\n$\\bar{D}{}^*\\Sigma^*_c$ with $J^P = 1/2^-, 5/2^-$.\n", "  We use the compactified twistor correspondence for the (2+1)-dimensional\nintegrable chiral model to prove a conjecture of Ward. In particular, we\nconstruct the correspondence space of a compactified twistor fibration and use\nit to prove that the second Chern numbers of the holomorphic vector bundles,\ncorresponding to the uniton solutions of the integrable chiral model, equal the\nthird homotopy classes of the restricted extended solutions of the unitons.\nTherefore we deduce that the total energy of a time-dependent uniton is\nproportional to the second Chern number.\n", "  The presence of non-Abelian discrete gauge symmetries in four-dimensional\nF-theory compactifications is investigated. Such symmetries are shown to arise\nfrom seven-brane configurations in genuine F-theory settings without a weak\nstring coupling description. Gauge fields on mutually non-local seven-branes\nare argued to gauge both R-R and NS-NS two-form bulk axions. The gauging is\ncompleted into a generalisation of the Heisenberg group with either additional\nseven-brane gauge fields or R-R bulk gauge fields. The former case relies on\nhaving seven-brane fluxes, while the latter case requires torsion cohomology\nand is analysed in detail through the M-theory dual. Remarkably, the M-theory\nreduction yields an Abelian theory that becomes non-Abelian when translated\ninto the correct duality frame to perform the F-theory limit. The reduction\nshows that the gauge coupling function depends on the gauged scalars and\ntransforms non-trivially as required for the groups encountered. This field\ndependence agrees with the expectations for the kinetic mixing of seven-branes\nand is unchanged if the gaugings are absent.\n", "  The status of lattice calculations of the quark spin, the quark orbital\nangular momentum, the glue angular momentum and glue spin in the nucleon is\nsummarized. The quark spin calculation is recently carried out from the\nanomalous Ward identity with chiral fermions and is found to be small mainly\ndue to the large negative anomaly term which is believed to be the source of\nthe `proton spin crisis'. We also present the first calculation of the glue\nspin at finite nucleon momenta.\n", "  The integrated cross section $\\widetilde\\sigma$ for a special type of double\npolarized proton-deuteron scattering constitutes a null test\nforvtime-invariance violating but P-parity conserving effects. Using the\nGlauber theory for the $pd$ elastic scattering and different types of\nphenomenological T-odd P-even NN-interactions we show that the contribution of\nthe lowest mass meson exchange, i.e. the $\\rho$-meson, to the null-test signal\n$\\widetilde\\sigma$ vanishes. Variation of the cross section $\\widetilde\\sigma$\ndue to strong hadronic and Coulomb interaction is studied and its energy\ndependence is calculated in the GeV region.\n", "  Polynomials on stranded graphs are higher dimensional generalization of Tutte\nand Bollob\\'as-Riordan polynomials [Math. Ann. 323 (2002), 81-96]. Here, we\ndeepen the analysis of the polynomial invariant defined on rank 3\nweakly-colored stranded graphs introduced in arXiv:1301.1987. We successfully\nfind in dimension $D\\geq3$ a modified Euler characteristic with $D-2$\nparameters. Using this modified invariant, we extend the rank 3 weakly-colored\ngraph polynomial, and its main properties, on rank 4 and then on arbitrary rank\n$D$ weakly-colored stranded graphs.\n", "  We study the collider signatures of a long-lived massive colored scalar\ntransforming trivially under the weak interaction and decaying within the inner\nsections of a detector such as ATLAS or CMS. In our study, we assume that the\ncolored scalar couples at tree-level to a top quark and a stable fermion,\npossibly arising from a dark sector or from supersymmetric extensions of the\nStandard Model. After implementing the latest experimental searches for\nlong-lived colored scalars, we observe a region of parameter space consistent\nwith a colored electroweak-singlet scalar with mass between $\\sim200-350$ GeV\nand a lifetime between $0.1-1$ $\\text{mm}/c$ together, with a nearly degenerate\ndark fermion that may be probed at the $\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV LHC. We show that a\nsearch strategy using a combination of cuts on missing transverse energy and\nimpact parameters can exclude regions of parameter space not accessed by prompt\nsearches. We show that a region of parameter space within our simplified model\nmay naturally arise from the light-stop window regime of supersymmetric\nextensions of the Standard Model, where a light mostly right-handed stop has a\nmass slightly larger than the lightest neutralino and decays through a\nfour-body process.\n", "  We outline a program for obtaining an action principle for dissipative fluid\ndynamics by considering the holographic Wilsonian renormalization group applied\nto systems with a gravity dual. As a first step, in this paper we restrict to\nsystems with a non-dissipative horizon. By integrating out gapped degrees of\nfreedom in the bulk gravitational system between an asymptotic boundary and a\nhorizon, we are led to a formulation of hydrodynamics where the dynamical\nvariables are not standard velocity and temperature fields, but the relative\nembedding of the boundary and horizon hypersurfaces. At zeroth order, this\naction reduces to that proposed by Dubovsky et al. as an off-shell formulation\nof ideal fluid dynamics.\n", "  The fact that the clustering of dark matter halos depends not only on their\nmass, but also the formation epoch, is a prominent, albeit subtle, feature of\nthe cold dark matter structure formation theory, and is known as assembly bias.\nAt low mass scales ($\\sim 10^{12}\\,h^{-1}M_\\odot$), early-forming halos are\npredicted to be more strongly clustered than the late-forming ones. In this\nstudy we aim to robustly detect the signature of assembly bias observationally,\nmaking use of formation time indicators of central galaxies in low mass halos\nas a proxy for the halo formation history. Weak gravitational lensing is\nemployed to ensure our early- and late-forming halo samples have similar\nmasses, and are free of contamination of satellites from more massive halos.\nFor the two formation time indicators used (resolved star formation history and\ncurrent specific star formation rate), we do not find convincing evidence of\nassembly bias. For a pair of early- and late-forming galaxy samples with mean\nmass $M_{200c} \\approx 9\\times10^{11}\\,h^{-1}M_\\odot$, the relative bias is\n$1.00\\pm 0.12$. We attribute the lack of detection to the possibilities that\neither the current measurements of these indicators are too noisy, or they do\nnot correlate well with the halo formation history. Alternative proxies for the\nhalo formation history that should perform better are suggested for future\nstudies.\n", "  Biological organisms adapt to changes by processing informations from\ndifferent sources, most notably from their ancestors and from their\nenvironment. We review an approach to quantify these informations by analyzing\nmathematical models of evolutionary dynamics, and show how explicit results are\nobtained for a solvable subclass of these models. In several limits, the\nresults coincide with those obtained in studies of information processing for\ncommunication, gambling or thermodynamics. In the most general case, however,\ninformation processing by biological populations shows unique features that\nmotivate the analysis of specific models.\n", "  Graphene-based vertical heterostructures, particularly stacks incorporated\nwith other layered materials, are promising for nanoelectronics. The stacking\nof two model Dirac materials, graphene and topological insulator, can\nconsiderably enlarge the family of van der Waals heterostructures. Despite well\nunderstanding of the two individual materials, the electron transport\nproperties of a combined vertical heterojunction are still unknown. Here we\nshow the experimental realization of a vertical heterojunction between Bi2Se3\nnanoplate and monolayer graphene. At low temperatures, the electron transport\nthrough the vertical heterojunction is dominated by the tunneling process,\nwhich can be effectively tuned by gate voltage to alter the density of states\nnear the Fermi surface. In the presence of a magnetic field, quantum\noscillations are observed due to the quantized Landau levels in both graphene\nand the two-dimensional surface states of Bi2Se3. Furthermore, we observe an\nexotic gate-tunable tunneling resistance under high magnetic field, which\ndisplays resistance maxima when the underlying graphene becomes a quantum Hall\ninsulator.\n", "  We compare three methods to measure the count-in-cell probability density\nfunction of galaxies in a spectroscopic redshift survey. From this comparison\nwe found that when the sampling is low (the average number of object per cell\nis around unity) it is necessary to use a parametric method to model the galaxy\ndistribution. We used a set of mock catalogues of VIPERS, in order to verify if\nwe were able to reconstruct the cell-count probability distribution once the\nobservational strategy is applied. We find that in the simulated catalogues,\nthe probability distribution of galaxies is better represented by a Gamma\nexpansion than a Skewed Log-Normal. Finally, we correct the cell-count\nprobability distribution function from the angular selection effect of the\nVIMOS instrument and study the redshift and absolute magnitude dependency of\nthe underlying galaxy density function in VIPERS from redshift $0.5$ to $1.1$.\nWe found very weak evolution of the probability density distribution function\nand that it is well approximated, independently from the chosen tracers, by a\nGamma distribution.\n", "  We consider a three-dimensional network of aqueous droplets joined by single\nlipid bilayers to form a cohesive, tissue-like material. The droplets in these\nnetworks can be programmed to have distinct osmolarities so that osmotic\ngradients generate internal stresses via local fluid flows to cause the network\nto change shape. We discover, using molecular dynamics simulations, a\nreversible folding-unfolding process by adding an osmotic interaction with the\nsurrounding environment which necessarily evolves dynamically as the shape of\nthe network changes. This discovery is the next important step towards osmotic\nrobotics in this system. We also explore analytically and numerically how the\nnetworks become faceted via buckling and how quasi-one-dimensional networks\nbecome three-dimensional.\n", "  We propose a description for the quasi-equilibrium self-assembly of small,\nsingle-stranded (ss) RNA viruses whose capsid proteins (CPs) have flexible,\npositively charged, disordered tails that associate with the negatively charged\nRNA genome molecules. We describe the assembly of such viruses as the interplay\nbetween two coupled phase-transition like events: the formation of the protein\nshell (the capsid) by CPs and the condensation of a large ss viral RNA\nmolecule. Electrostatic repulsion between the CPs competes with attractive\nhydrophobic interactions and attractive interaction between neutralized RNA\nsegments mediated by the tail-groups. An assembly diagram is derived in terms\nof the strength of attractive interactions between CPs and between CPs and the\nRNA molecules. It is compared with the results of recent studies of viral\nassembly. We demonstrate that the conventional theory of self-assembly, which\ndoes describe the assembly of \\textit{empty} capsids, is in general not\napplicable to the self-assembly of RNA-encapsidating virions.\n", "  A method is described to solve the Poisson problem for a three dimensional\nsource distribution that is periodic into one direction. Perpendicular to the\ndirection of periodicity a free space (or open) boundary is realized. In beam\nphysics, this approach allows to calculate the space charge field of a\ncontinualized charged particle distribution with periodic pattern.\n  The method is based on a particle mesh approach with equidistant grid and\nfast convolution with a Green's function. The periodic approach uses only one\nperiod of the source distribution, but a periodic extension of the Green's\nfunction.\n  The approach is numerically efficient and allows the investigation of\nperiodic- and pseudo-periodic structures with period lengths that are small\ncompared to the source dimensions, for instance of laser modulated beams or of\nthe evolution of micro bunch structures. Applications for laser modulated beams\nare given.\n", "  We introduce and analyze a class of growing geometric random graphs that are\ninvariant under rescaling of space and time. Directed connections between nodes\nare drawn according to influence zones that depend on node position in space\nand time, mimicking the heterogeneity and increased specialization found in\ngrowing networks. Through calculations and numerical simulations we explore the\nconsequences of scale-invariance for geometric random graphs generated this\nway. Our analysis reveals a dichotomy between scale-free and Poisson\ndistributions of in- and out-degree, the existence of a random number of hub\nnodes, high clustering, and unusual percolation behaviour. These properties are\nsimilar to those of empirically observed web graphs.\n", "  Image formation for radio astronomy can be defined as estimating the spatial\npower distribution of celestial sources over the sky, given an array of\nantennas. One of the challenges with image formation is that the problem\nbecomes ill-posed as the number of pixels becomes large. The introduction of\nconstraints that incorporate a-priori knowledge is crucial. In this paper we\nshow that in addition to non-negativity, the magnitude of each pixel in an\nimage is also bounded from above. Indeed, the classical \"dirty image\" is an\nupper bound, but a much tighter upper bound can be formed from the data using\narray processing techniques. This formulates image formation as a least squares\noptimization problem with inequality constraints. We propose to solve this\nconstrained least squares problem using active set techniques, and the steps\nneeded to implement it are described. It is shown that the least squares part\nof the problem can be efficiently implemented with Krylov subspace based\ntechniques, where the structure of the problem allows massive parallelism and\nreduced storage needs. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using\nsimulations.\n", "  We study the Laurent property for autonomous and nonautonomous discrete\nequations. First we show, without relying on the caterpillar lemma, the Laurent\nproperty for the Hirota-Miwa and the discrete BKP equations. Next we introduce\nthe notion of reductions and gauge transformations for discrete bilinear\nequations and we prove that these preserve the Laurent property. Using these\ntwo techniques, we obtain the explicit condition on the coefficients of a\nnonautonomous discrete bilinear equation for it to possess the Laurent\nproperty. Finally we study the denominators of the iterates of an equation with\nthe Laurent property and we show that any reduction to a mapping on a\none-dimensional lattice of a nonautonomous Hirota-Miwa equation or discrete BKP\nequation, with the Laurent property, has zero algebraic entropy.\n", "  We reformulate perturbation theory for neutrino oscillations in matter with\nan expansion parameter related to the ratio of the solar to the atmospheric\n$\\Delta m^2$ scales. Unlike previous works, we use a renormalized basis in\nwhich certain first-order effects are taken into account in the zeroth-order\nHamiltonian. We show that the new framework has an exceptional feature that\nleads to the neutrino oscillation probability in matter with the same structure\nas in vacuum to first order in the expansion parameter. It facilitates\nimmediate physical interpretation of the formulas, and makes the expressions\nfor the neutrino oscillation probabilities extremely simple and compact. We\nfind, for example, that the $\\nu_e$ disappearance probability at this order is\nof a simple two-flavor form with an appropriately identified mixing angle and\n$\\Delta m^2$. More generally, all the oscillation probabilities can be written\nin the universal form with the channel-discrimination coefficient of $0,~\\pm1$\nor simple functions of $\\theta_{23}$. Despite their simple forms they include\nall order effects of $\\theta_{13}$ and all order effects of the matter\npotential, to first order in our expansion parameter.\n", "  Particles passing through a crystal under planar channeling experience\ntransverse oscillations in their motion. As channeled particles approach the\natomic planes of a crystal, they are likely to be dechanneled. This effect was\nused in ion-beam analysis with MeV energy. We studied this effect in a bent\ncrystal for positive and negative particles within a wide range of energies in\nsight of application of such crystals at accelerators. We found the conditions\nfor the appearance or not of channeling oscillations. Indeed a new kind of\noscillations, strictly related to the motion of over-barrier particles, i.e.\nquasichanneling particles, has been predicted. Such oscillations, named planar\nquasichanneling oscillations, possess a different nature than channeling\noscillations. Through computer simulation, we studied this effect and provided\na theoretical interpretation for them. We show that channeling oscillations can\nbe observed only for positive particles while quasichanneling oscillations can\nexist for particles with either sign. The conditions for experimental\nobservation of channeling and quasichanneling oscillations at existing\naccelerators with available crystal has been found and optimized.\n", "  We study the photoionization of argon atoms close to the 3s$^2$3p$^6$\n$\\rightarrow$ 3s$^1$3p$^6$4p $\\leftrightarrow$ 3s$^2$3p$^5$ $\\varepsilon \\ell$,\n$\\ell$=s,d Fano window resonance. An interferometric technique using an\nattosecond pulse train, i.e. a frequency comb in the extreme ultraviolet range,\nand a weak infrared probe field allows us to study both amplitude and phase of\nthe photoionization probability amplitude as a function of photon energy. A\ntheoretical calculation of the ionization process accounting for several\ncontinuum channels and bandwidth effects reproduces well the experimental\nobservations and shows that the phase variation of the resonant two-photon\namplitude depends on the interaction between the channels involved in the\nautoionization process.\n", "  The Kondo system CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$ shows a strong anisotropy in its electric,\noptic and magnetic properties. We employ density functional theory plus\ndynamical mean field theory and show that the predominant Ce-$f$ state has\ntotal angular moment $J=5/2$ and $z$-component $m_J=\\pm 1/2$ in agreement with\nrecent X-ray absorption experiments. Even though CeRu$_4$Sn$_6$ has the direct\ngap of a Kondo insulator through most of the Brillouin zone it remains weakly\nmetallic. This is because of (i) a band crossing in the $z$-direction and (ii)\na negative indirect gap.\n", "  Metal ions play numerous important roles in biological systems being central\nto the function of biomolecules. In this letter we show that the absorption of\nX-rays by these ions leads to a complicated chain of ultrafast relaxation steps\nresulting in the complete degradation of their nearest environment. We\nconducted high quality ab initio studies on microsolvated Mg clusters\ndemonstrating that ionisation of an 1s-electron of Mg leads to a complicated\nelectronic cascade comprising both intra- and intermolecular steps and lasting\nonly a few hundreds femtoseconds. The metal cation reverts to its original\ncharge state at the end of the cascade, while the nearest solvation shell\nbecomes multiply ionised and large concentrations of radical and slow electron\nspecies build up in the metal vicinity. We conclude that such cascades\ninvolving metal ions are essential for understanding the radiation chemistry of\nsolutions and radiation damage to metal containing biomolecules.\n", "  We study the characteristics of the galaxy cluster samples expected from the\nEuropean Space Agency's Euclid satellite and forecast constraints on\ncosmological parameters describing a variety of cosmological models. The method\nused in this paper, based on the Fisher Matrix approach, is the same one used\nto provide the constraints presented in the Euclid Red Book (Laureijs et\nal.2011). We describe the analytical approach to compute the selection function\nof the photometric and spectroscopic cluster surveys. Based on the photometric\nselection function, we forecast the constraints on a number of cosmological\nparameter sets corresponding to different extensions of the standard LambdaCDM\nmodel. The dynamical evolution of dark energy will be constrained to Delta\nw_0=0.03 and Delta w_a=0.2 with free curvature Omega_k, resulting in a\n(w_0,w_a) Figure of Merit (FoM) of 291. Including the Planck CMB covariance\nmatrix improves the constraints to Delta w_0=0.02, Delta w_a=0.07 and a\nFoM=802. The amplitude of primordial non-Gaussianity, parametrised by f_NL,\nwill be constrained to \\Delta f_NL ~ 6.6 for the local shape scenario, from\nEuclid clusters alone. Using only Euclid clusters, the growth factor parameter\n\\gamma, which signals deviations from GR, will be constrained to Delta\n\\gamma=0.02, and the neutrino density parameter to Delta Omega_\\nu=0.0013 (or\nDelta \\sum m_\\nu=0.01). We emphasise that knowledge of the observable--mass\nscaling relation will be crucial to constrain cosmological parameters from a\ncluster catalogue. The Euclid mission will have a clear advantage in this\nrespect, thanks to its imaging and spectroscopic capabilities that will enable\ninternal mass calibration from weak lensing and the dynamics of cluster\ngalaxies. This information will be further complemented by wide-area\nmulti-wavelength external cluster surveys that will already be available when\nEuclid flies. [Abridged]\n", "  Ostrogradsky's method allows one to construct Hamiltonian formulation for a\nhigher derivative system. An application of this approach to the Pais-Uhlenbeck\noscillator yields the Hamiltonian which is unbounded from below. This leads to\nthe ghost problem in quantum theory. In order to avoid this nasty feature, the\ntechnique previously developed in [Acta Phys. Polon. B 36 (2005) 2115] is used\nto construct an alternative Hamiltonian formulation for the multidimensional\nPais-Uhlenbeck oscillator of arbitrary even order with distinct frequencies of\noscillation. This construction is also generalized to the case of an N=2\nsupersymmetric Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator.\n", "  In this paper we use Noether symmetries of the geodesic Lagrangian in Bianchi\nV spacetimes to study various cosmological solutions of Einstein's field\nequations. Our first result is the identification of the subalgebras of Noether\nsymmetries of the equations of motions in such spacetimes with dimension 4, 5,\n6, 7, 9 or 10 of the maximal algebra of Lie point symmetries of dimension 13.\nSecondly we give physical interpretation of new cosmological solutions which\nsatisfy positive energy condition and yield critical bounds on the expansion\ncoefficient $\\alpha$, in which the underlying non-flat spacetimes carry\ninteresting physical properties. Specifically the energy density behaves in one\nof the following ways. (i) It is positive and constant for all time. (ii) It\nvaries with time and attains a global maximum after some time and then\nasymptotically converges to zero. (iii) It increases for all time and attains a\nmaximum value at the asymptotic limit $t\\rightarrow \\infty$. In particular a\nnon-flat spacetime is obtained that mimics the expansion in a flat FRW universe\ndominated by vacuum energy such that the expansion factor has the same form in\nboth. However, the energy density is dynamical in the former.\n", "  We consider the response of etalons created by a combination of a\nconventional mirror and a metasurface, composed of a periodic lattice of metal\nscatterers with a resonant response. This geometry has been used previously for\nperfect absorption, in so-called Salisbury screens, and for hybridization of\nlocalized plasmons with Fabry-Perot resonances. The particular aspect we\naddress is if one can assume an environment-independent reflectivity for the\nmetasurface when calculating the reflectivity of the composite system, as in a\nstandard Fabry-Perot analysis, or whether the fact that the metasurface\ninteracts with its own mirror image renormalizes its response. Using lattice\nsum theory, we take into account all possible retarded dipole-dipole\ninteractions of scatterers in the metasurface amongst each other, and through\nthe mirror. We show that while a layer-by-layer Fabry-Perot formalism captures\nthe main qualitative features of metasurface etalons, in fact the mirror\nmodifies both the polarizability and reflectivity of the metasurface in a\nfashion that is akin to Drexhage's modification of the radiative properties of\na single dipole.\n", "  In this paper, we analyse the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the third quantized\nformalism. We will demonstrate that for certain operator ordering, the early\nstages of the universe are dominated by quantum fluctuations, and the universe\nbecomes classical at later stages during the cosmic expansion. This is\nphysically expected, if the universe is formed from quantum fluctuations in the\nthird quantized formalism. So, we will argue that this physical requirement can\nbe used to constrain the form of the operator ordering chosen. We will\nexplicitly demonstrate this to be the case for two different cosmological\nmodels.\n", "  Biological information processing networks consist of many components, which\nare coupled by an even larger number of complex multivariate interactions.\nHowever, analyses of data sets from fields as diverse as neuroscience,\nmolecular biology, and behavior have reported that observed statistics of\nstates of some biological networks can be approximated well by maximum entropy\nmodels with only pairwise interactions among the components. Based on\nsimulations of random Ising spin networks with $p$-spin ($p>2$) interactions,\nhere we argue that this reduction in complexity can be thought of as a natural\nproperty of densely interacting networks in certain regimes, and not\nnecessarily as a special property of living systems. By connecting our analysis\nto the theory of random constraint satisfaction problems, we suggest a reason\nfor why some biological systems may operate in this regime.\n", "  One-shot decoupling is a powerful primitive in quantum information theory and\nwas hypothesized to play a role in the black hole information paradox. We study\nblack hole dynamics modeled by a trilinear Hamiltonian whose semiclassical\nlimit gives rise to Hawking radiation. An explicit numerical calculation of the\ndiscretized path integral of the S-matrix shows that decoupling is exact in the\ncontinuous limit, implying that quantum information is perfectly transferred\nfrom the black hole to radiation. A striking consequence of decoupling is the\nemergence of an output radiation entropy profile that follows Page's\nprediction. We argue that information transfer and the emergence of Page curves\nis a robust feature of any multi-linear interaction Hamiltonian with a bounded\nspectrum.\n", "  The China Accelerator Driven Sub-critical System (CADS) is a high intensity\nproton facility to dispose of nuclear waste and generate electric power. CADS\nis based on 1.5GeV, 10mA CW superconducting (SC) linac as a driver. The\nhigh-energy section of the linac is compose of two families of SC elliptical\ncavities which are designed for the geometrical beta 0.63 and 0.82. In this\npaper, the 650 MHz \\b{eta}=0.63 SC elliptical cavity was studied including\ncavity optimization, multipacting, high order modes (HOMs) and generator RF\npower calculation. Keywords: high current, medium beta, ADS, superconducting\ncavity, HOMs\n", "  The main purpose of the NA62 experiment is to measure the branching ratio of\nthe (ultra) rare decay $K+ \\rightarrow {\\pi}+{\\nu}\\bar{\\nu}$ with the precision\nof 10% collecting about 100 events with the Standard Model branching fraction\nin 3 years of data taking. The commissioning of the experiment after the 2014\npilot run and the prospects for the 2015 run are presented.\n", "  Inelastic neutron scattering experiments are performed on a nanoporous metal\ncomplex Cu-Trans-1,4-Cyclohexanedicarboxylic Acid (Cu-CHD) adsorbing O2\nmolecules to identify the spin model of the O2-based magnet realized in the\nhost complex. It is found that the magnetic excitations of Cu-CHDs adsorbing\nlow- and high-concentration O2 molecules are explained by different spin\nmodels, the former by spin dimers and the latter by spin trimers. By using the\nobtained parameters and also by assuming that the levels of the higher energy\nstates are reduced because of the non-negligible spin dependence of the\nmolecular potential of oxygen, the magnetization curves are explained in\nquantitative level.\n", "  Semiconductor light emitters compatible with standard Si integration\ntechnology (SIT) are of particular interest for overcoming limitations in the\noperating speed of microelectronic devices 1-3. Light sources based on group-IV\nelements would be SIT compatible but suffer from the poor optoelectronic\nproperties of bulk Si and Ge. Here, we demonstrate that epitaxially grown Ge\nquantum dots (QDs) in a fully coherent Si matrix show extraordinary optical\nproperties if partially amorphised by Ge-ion bombardment (GIB). The GIB-QDs\nexhibit a quasi-direct-band gap and show, in contrast to conventional SiGe\nnanostructures, almost no thermal quenching of the photoluminescence (PL) up to\nroom-temperature (RT). Microdisk resonators with embedded GIB-QDs exhibit\nthreshold-behaviour and super-linear increase of the integrated PL-intensity\n(IPL) with increasing excitation power Pexc which indicates light amplification\nby stimulated emission in a fully SIT-compatible group-IV nano-system.\n", "  We study the non-equilibrium condensation process in a holographic\nsuperconductor with nonlinear corrections to the U(1) gauge field. We start\nwith an asymptotic Anti-de-Sitter(AdS) black hole against a complex scalar\nperturbation at the initial time, and solve the dynamics of the gravitational\nsystems in the bulk. When the black hole temperature T is smaller than a\ncritical value Tc, the scalar perturbation grows exponentially till saturation,\nthe final state of spacetime approaches to a hairy black hole. In the bulk\ntheory, we find the clue of the influence of nonlinear corrections in the gauge\nfield on the process of the scalar field condensation. We show that the bulk\ndynamics in the non-equilibrium process is completely consistent with the\nobservations on the boundary order parameter. Furthermore we examine the time\nevolution of horizons in the bulk non-equilibrium transformation process from\nthe bald AdS black hole to the AdS hairy hole. Both the evolution of apparent\nand event horizons show that the original AdS black hole configuration requires\nmore time to finish the transformation to become a hairy black hole if there is\nnonlinear correction to the electromagnetic field. We generalize our\nnon-equilibrium discussions to the holographic entanglement entropy and find\nthat the holographic entanglement entropy can give us further understanding of\nthe influence of the nonlinearity in the gauge field on the scalar\ncondensation. In our analysis, we also compare the effect of different models\non the corrections to the gauge field on the formation of holographic\nsuperconductor.\n", "  We theoretically study a one-dimensional quasi-periodic Fermi system with\ntopological $p$-wave superfluidity, which can be deduced from a topologically\nnon-trivial tight-binding model on the square lattice in a uniform magnetic\nfield and subject to a non-Abelian gauge field. The system may be regarded a\nnon-Abelian generalization of the well-known Aubry-Andr\\'e-Harper model. We\ninvestigate its phase diagram as functions of the strength of the\nquasi-disorder and the amplitude of the $p$-wave order parameter, through a\nnumber of numerical investigations, including a multifractal analysis. There\nare four distinct phases separated by three critical lines, i.e., two phases\nwith all extended wave-functions (I and IV), a topologically trivial phase (II)\nwith all localized wave-functions and a critical phase (III) with all\nmultifractal wave-functions. The phase I is related to the phase IV by duality.\nIt also seems to be related to the phase II by duality. Our proposed phase\ndiagram may be observable in current cold-atom experiments, in view of\nsimulating non-Abelian gauge fields and topological insulators/superfluids with\nultracold atoms.\n", "  Buchdahl, by imposing a few physical assumptions on the matter, i.e., its\ndensity is a nonincreasing function of the radius and the fluid is a perfect\nfluid, and on the configuration, such as the exterior is the Schwarzschild\nsolution, found that the radius $r_0$ to mass $m$ ratio of a star would obey\nthe Buchdahl bound $r_0/m\\geq9/4$. He noted that the bound was saturated by the\nSchwarzschild interior solution, the solution with $\\rho_{\\rm m}(r)= {\\rm\nconstant}$, where $\\rho_{\\rm m}(r)$ is the energy density of the matter at $r$,\nwhen the central central pressure blows to infinity. Generalizations of this\nbound have been studied. One generalization was given by Andr\\'easson by\nincluding electrically charged matter and imposing that $p+2p_T \\leq\\rho_{\\rm\nm}$, where $p$ is the radial pressure and $p_T$ the tangential pressure. His\nbound is given by $r_0/m\\geq9/\\left(1+\\sqrt{1+3\\,q^2/r_0^2}\\right)^{2}$, the\nBuchdahl-Andr\\'easson bound, with $q$ being the star's total electric charge.\nFollowing Andr\\'easson's proof, the configuration that saturates the Buchdahl\nbound is an uncharged shell, rather than the Schwarzschild interior solution.\nBy extension, the configurations that saturate the Buchdahl-Andr\\'easson bound\nare charged shells. One expects then, in turn, that there should exist an\nelectrically charged equivalent to the interior Schwarzschild limit. We find\nhere that this equivalent is provided by the equation $\\rho_{\\rm m}(r) +\n{Q^2(r)}/ {\\left(8\\pi\\,r^4\\right)}= {\\rm constant}$, where $Q(r)$ is the\nelectric charge at $r$. This equation was put forward by Cooperstock and de la\nCruz, and Florides, and realized in Guilfoyle's stars. When the central\npressure goes to infinity Guilfoyle's stars are configurations that saturate\nthe Buchdahl-Andr\\'easson bound. It remains to find a proof in Buchdahl's\nmanner such that these configurations are the limiting configurations of the\nbound.\n", "  We analyze the quantum melting of two-dimensional Wigner molecules (WM) in\nconfined geometries with distinct symmetries and compare it with corresponding\nthermal melting. Our findings unfold complementary mechanisms that drive the\nquantum and thermal crossovers in a WM and show that the symmetry of the\nconfinement plays no significant role in determining the quantum crossover\nscale $n_X$. This is because the zero-point motion screens the boundary effects\nwithin short distances. The phase diagram as a function of thermal and quantum\nfluctuations determined from independent criteria is unique, and shows\n\"melting\" from the WM to both the classical and quantum \"liquids.\" An\nintriguing signature of weakening liquidity with increasing temperature, $T$,\nis found in the extreme quantum regime. The crossover is associated with\nproduction of defects. However, these defects appear to play distinct roles in\ndriving the quantum and thermal \"melting.\" Our study will help comprehending\nmelting in a variety of experimental traps - from quantum dots to complex\nplasma.\n", "  We exploit a recent advance in the study of topological superconductors to\npropose a solution to the family puzzle of particle physics in the context of\nSO(18) (or more correctly, Spin(18)) grand unification. We argue that Yukawa\ncouplings of intermediate strength may allow the mirror matter and extra\nfamilies to decouple at arbitrarily high energies. As was clear from the\nexisting literature, we have to go beyond the Higgs mechanism in order to solve\nthe family puzzle. A pattern of symmetry breaking which results in the SU(5)\ngrand unified theory with horizontal or family symmetry USp(4) = Spin(5) (or\nmore loosely, SO(5)) leaves exactly three light families of matter and seems\nparticularly appealing. We comment briefly on an alternative scheme involving\ndiscrete non-abelian family symmetries. In a few lengthy appendices we review\nsome of the pertinent condensed matter theory.\n", "  The existence of nanoscale ductility during the fracture of silicate glasses\nremains controversial. Here, based on molecular dynamics simulations coupled\nwith topological constraint theory, we show that nano-ductility arises from the\nspatial heterogeneity of the atomic network's rigidity. Specifically, we report\nthat localized floppy modes of deformation in under-constrained regions of the\nglass enable plastic deformations of the network, resulting in permanent change\nin bond configurations. Ultimately, these heterogeneous plastic events\npercolate, thereby resulting in a non-brittle mode of fracture. This suggests\nthat nano-ductility is intrinsic to multi-component silicate glasses having\nnanoscale heterogeneities.\n", "  The superposition principle is one of the landmarks of quantum mechanics. The\nimportance of quantum superpositions provokes questions about the limitations\nthat quantum mechanics itself imposes on the possibility of their generation.\nIn this work we systematically study the problem of creation of superpositions\nof unknown quantum states. First, we prove a no-go theorem that forbids the\nexistence of a universal probabilistic quantum protocol producing a\nsuperposition of two unknown quantum states. Secondly, we provide an explicit\nprobabilistic protocol generating a superposition of two unknown states, each\nhaving a fixed overlap with the known referential pure state. The protocol is\nproven to be unique and optimal. Moreover, it can be implemented on arbitrary\nHilbert spaces. In the context of quantum optics it can be used to efficiently\ngenerate highly nonclassical or nongaussian states.\n", "  We present a comprehensive study of spectroscopic radius measurements of\ntwelve neutron stars obtained during thermonuclear bursts or in quiescence. We\nincorporate, for the first time, a large number of systematic uncertainties in\nthe measurement of the apparent angular sizes, Eddington fluxes, and distances,\nin the composition of the interstellar medium, and in the flux calibration of\nX-ray detectors. We also take into account the results of recent theoretical\ncalculations of rotational effects on neutron star radii, of atmospheric\neffects on surface spectra, and of relativistic corrections to the Eddington\ncritical flux. We employ Bayesian statistical frameworks to obtain neutron star\nradii from the spectroscopic measurements as well as to infer the equation of\nstate from the radius measurements. Combining these with the results of\nexperiments in the vicinity of nuclear saturation density and the observations\nof ~2 Msun neutron stars, we place strong and quantitative constraints on the\nproperties of the equation of state between approximately 2-8 times the nuclear\nsaturation density. We find that around M=1.5 Msun, the preferred equation of\nstate predicts radii between 10.1 - 11.1 km. When interpreting the pressure\nconstraints in the context of high density equations of state based on\ninteracting nucleons, our results suggest a relatively weak contribution of the\nthree-body interaction potential.\n", "  It is shown that surface conduction can stabilize electrodeposition in\nrandom, charged porous media at high rates, above the diffusion-limited\ncurrent. After linear sweep voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy, copper\nelectrodeposits are visualized by scanning electron microscopy and energy\ndispersive spectroscopy in two different porous separators (cellulose nitrate,\npolyethylene), whose surfaces are modified by layer-by-layer deposition of\npositive or negative charged polyelectrolytes. Above the limiting current,\nsurface conduction inhibits growth in the positive separators and produces\nirregular dendrites, while it enhances growth and suppresses dendrites behind a\ndeionization shock in the negative separators, also leading to improved cycle\nlife. The discovery of stable uniform growth in the random media differs from\nthe non-uniform growth observed in parallel nanopores and cannot be explained\nby classical quasi-steady leaky membrane models, which always predict\ninstability and dendritic growth. Instead, the experimental results suggest\nthat transient electro-diffusion in random porous media imparts the stability\nof a deionization shock to the growing metal interface behind it. Shock\nelectrodeposition could be exploited to enhance the cycle life and recharging\nrate of metal batteries or to accelerate the fabrication of metal matrix\ncomposite coatings.\n", "  Cartan's supersymmetriy fixes couplings of two types of fermions $\\psi, \\phi$\nand two types of vector fields $x_i$ and $x_{i'}$, ($i=1,2,3,4$). The\nelectromagnetic interaction of leptons and quarks is expressed as\n${^t\\psi}{\\mathcal C}x_i\\psi$. In the case of coupling of leptons and quarks\nwith $W$, we extend the coupling ${^t\\phi}{\\mathcal C}X\\psi$ to\n${^t\\phi}{\\mathcal C}X(1-\\gamma_5)\\psi$, where $X=x_i$ or ${x_i}'$, and unify\nthe interactions in the form $ {^t\\phi}{\\mathcal\nC}\\bar{x_i}\\psi+{^t\\phi}{\\mathcal C} \\bar{{x_i}'} {\\mathcal C}\\psi $, where\n$\\bar{x_i}$ implies appropriate $x_i$ or $(-\\gamma_5 x_i)$ is chosen. The\n$\\gamma_5$ term induces in time component of $B^0\\to K^0\\, J/\\Psi$, $K^0$ with\nthe $\\bar s$ quark dominated by the small component, while in space components\nof $\\bar B^0\\to \\bar K^0\\, J/\\Psi$, $\\bar K^0$ with the $s$ quark dominated by\nthe small component. This asymmetry could be the origin of the $CP$ asymmetry\nin the $B^0\\to K^0\\, J/\\Psi$.\n  We apply the model to $B_{s(d)}^0\\to D_{s(d)}^- D_{s(d)}^+$ decays and study\nviolation of $CP$ symmetry via interference of tree and penguin contributions,\nand observe that the asymmetry is weak consistent to the experiment.\n", "  A spherically symmetric wormhole in Newtonian gravitation in curved space,\nenhanced with a connection between the mass density and the Ricci scalar, is\npresented. The wormhole, consisting of two connected asymptotically flat\nregions, inhabits a spherically symmetric curved space. The gravitational\npotential, gravitational field and the pressure that supports the fluid that\npermeates the Newtonian wormhole are computed. Particle dynamics and tidal\neffects in this geometry are studied. The possibility of having Newtonian black\nholes in this theory is sketched.\n", "  The mechanism of high temperature superconductivity in the iron-based\nsuperconductors remains an outstanding issue in condensed matter physics. The\nelectronic structure, in particular the Fermi surface topology, is considered\nto play an essential role in dictating the superconductivity. Recent revelation\nof distinct electronic structure and possible high temperature\nsuperconductivity with a transition temperature Tc above 65 K in the\nsingle-layer FeSe films grown on the SrTiO3 substrate provides key information\non the roles of Fermi surface topology and interface in inducing or enhancing\nsuperconductivity. Here we report high resolution angle-resolved photoemission\nmeasurement on the electronic structure and superconducting gap of a novel\nFeSe-based superconductor, (Li0.84Fe0.16)OHFe0.98Se, with a Tc at 41 K. We find\nthat this single-phase bulk superconductor shows remarkably similar electronic\nbehaviors to that of the superconducting single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 film in terms\nof Fermi surface topology, band structure and nearly isotropic superconducting\ngap without nodes. These observations provide significant insights in\nunderstanding high temperature superconductivity in the single-layer\nFeSe/SrTiO3 film in particular, and the mechanism of superconductivity in the\niron-based superconductors in general.\n", "  We study Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT) and its regularization in the\nEffective Field Theory (EFT) approach. We evaluate the LPT displacement with\nthe same phases as a corresponding $N$-body simulation, which allows us to\ncompare perturbation theory to the non-linear simulation with significantly\nreduced cosmic variance, and provides a more stringent test than simply\ncomparing power spectra. We reliably detect a non-vanishing leading order EFT\ncoefficient and a stochastic displacement term, uncorrelated with the LPT\nterms. This stochastic term is expected in the EFT framework, and, to the best\nof our understanding, is not an artifact of numerical errors or transients in\nour simulations. This term constitutes a limit to the accuracy of perturbative\ndescriptions of the displacement field and its phases, corresponding to a $1\\%$\nerror on the non-linear power spectrum at $k=0.2 h$/Mpc at $z=0$. Predicting\nthe displacement power spectrum to higher accuracy or larger wavenumbers thus\nrequires a model for the stochastic displacement.\n", "  Oceanic Kelvin and Rossby waves play an important role in tropical climate\nand \\en dynamics. Here we develop and apply a climate network approach to\nquantify the characteristics of \\en related oceanic waves, based on sea surface\nheight satellite data. We associate the majority of dominant long distance\n($\\geq 500$ km) links of the network with (i) equatorial Kelvin waves, (ii)\noff-equatorial Rossby waves, and (iii) tropical instability waves. Notably, we\nfind that the location of the hubs of out-going ($\\sim 180^{\\circ}\\rm{E}$) and\nin-coming ($\\sim 140^{\\circ}\\rm{W}$) links of the climate network coincide with\nthe locations of the Kelvin wave initiation and dissipation, respectively. We\nalso find that this dissipation at $\\sim 140^{\\circ}\\rm{W}$ is much weaker\nduring \\en times. Moreover, the hubs of the off-equatorial network coincide\nwith the locations of westerly wind burst activity and high wind vorticity, two\nmechanisms that were associated with Rossby waves activity. The quantitative\nmethodology and measures developed here can improve the understanding of \\en\ndynamics and possibly its prediction.\n", "  We suggest that classicalization can cure non-local quantum field theories\nfrom acausal divergences in scattering amplitudes, restoring unitarity and\ncausality. In particular, in \"trans-non-local\" limit, the formation of\nnon-perturbative classical configurations, called {\\it classicalons}, in\nscatterings like $\\phi\\phi\\rightarrow \\phi\\phi$, can avoid typical acausal\ndivergences.\n", "  We have studied a Fermi system with attractive $U(r)$-symmetric interaction\nat the finite temperatures by the quantum field renormalization group (RG)\nmethod. The RG functions have been calculated in the framework of dimensional\nregularization and minimal subtraction scheme up to five loops. It has been\nfound that for $r\\geq 4$ the RG flux leaves the system's stability region --\nthe system undergoes a first order phase transition. To estimate the\ntemperature of the transition to superconducting or superfluid phase the RG\nanalysis for composite operators has been performed using three-loops\napproximation. As the result this analysis shows that for $3D$ systems\nestimated phase transition temperature is higher then well known theoretical\nestimations based on continuous phase transition formalism.\n", "  The epitaxial growth of {111} oriented Au on MoS$_2$ is well documented\ndespite the large lattice mismatch (~8% biaxial strain), and the fact that a Au\n{001} orientation results in much less elastic strain. An analysis based on\ndensity functional and linear elasticity theories reveals that the {111}\norientation is stabilized by a combination of favorable surface and interfacial\ncontributions to the energy, and the compliance of the first layer of the\nMoS$_2$.\n", "  EBSD has evolved into an effective tool for microstructure investigations in\nthe scanning electron microscope. The purpose of this contribution is to give\nan overview of various simulation approaches for EBSD Kikuchi patterns and to\ndiscuss some of the underlying physical mechanisms.\n", "  A fundamental aspect of biological information processing is the ubiquity of\nsequence-function relationships -- functions that map the sequence of DNA, RNA,\nor protein to a biochemically relevant activity. Most sequence-function\nrelationships in biology are quantitative, but only recently have experimental\ntechniques for effectively measuring these relationships been developed. The\nadvent of such \"massively parallel\" experiments presents an exciting\nopportunity for the concepts and methods of statistical physics to inform the\nstudy of biological systems. After reviewing these recent experimental\nadvances, we focus on the problem of how to infer parametric models of\nsequence-function relationships from the data produced by these experiments.\nSpecifically, we retrace and extend recent theoretical work showing that\ninference based on mutual information, not the standard likelihood-based\napproach, is often necessary for accurately learning the parameters of these\nmodels. Closely connected with this result is the emergence of \"diffeomorphic\nmodes\" -- directions in parameter space that are far less constrained by data\nthan likelihood-based inference would suggest. Analogous to Goldstone modes in\nphysics, diffeomorphic modes arise from an arbitrarily broken symmetry of the\ninference problem. An analytically tractable model of a massively parallel\nexperiment is then described, providing an explicit demonstration of these\nfundamental aspects of statistical inference. This paper concludes with an\noutlook on the theoretical and computational challenges currently facing\nstudies of quantitative sequence-function relationships.\n", "  The nonperturbative parton distributions, obtained from the Lorentz\ncontracted wave functions, are analyzed in the formalism of many-particle Fock\ncomponents and their properties are compared to the standard perturbative\ndistributions. We show that the collinear and IR divergencies specific for\nperturbative evolution treatment are absent in the nonperturbative version,\nhowever for large momenta< $ \\vep^2_i \\gg \\sigma$ (string tension), the\nbremsstrahlung kinematics is restored. A preliminary discussion of possible\nnonperturbative effects in DIS and high energy scattering is given, including\nin particular a possible role of multihybrid states in creating ridge-type\neffects.\n", "  Recently there has been interest in extending ghost-free massive gravity,\nbi-gravity, and multi-gravity by including non-standard kinetic terms and\nmatter couplings. We first review recent proposals for this class of\nextensions, emphasizing how modifications of the kinetic and potential\nstructure of the graviton and modifications of the coupling to matter are\nrelated. We then generalize existing no-go arguments in the metric language to\nthe vielbein language in second-order form. We give an ADM argument to show\nthat the most promising extensions to the kinetic term and matter coupling\ncontain a Boulware-Deser ghost. However, as recently emphasized, we may still\nbe able to view these extensions as effective field theories below some cutoff\nscale. To address this possibility, we show that there is a decoupling limit\nwhere a ghost appears for a wide class of matter couplings and kinetic terms.\nIn particular, we show that there is a decoupling limit where the linear\neffective vielbein matter coupling contains a ghost. Using the insight we gain\nfrom this decoupling limit analysis, we place an upper bound on the cutoff for\nthe linear effective vielbein coupling. This result can be generalized to new\nkinetic interactions in the vielbein language in second-order form. Combined\nwith recent results, this provides a strong uniqueness argument on the form of\nghost-free massive gravity, bi-gravity, and multi-gravity.\n", "  We have reconstructed the sunspot group count, not by comparisons with other\nreconstructions and correcting those where they were deemed to be deficient,\nbut by a re-assessment of original sources. The resulting series is a pure\nsolar index and does not rely on input from other proxies, e.g. radionuclides,\nauroral sightings, or geomagnetic records. 'Backboning' the data sets, our\nchosen method, provides substance and rigidity by using long-time observers as\na stiffness character. Solar activity, as defined by the Group Number, appears\nto reach and sustain for extended intervals of time the same level in each of\nthe last three centuries since 1700 and the past several decades do not seem to\nhave been exceptionally active, contrary to what is often claimed.\n", "  Schwinger's formalism in quantum field theory can be easily implemented in\nthe case of scalar theories in $D$ dimension with exponential interactions,\nsuch as $\\mu^D\\exp(\\alpha\\phi)$. In particular, we use the relation\n  $$\n  \\exp\\big(\\alpha{\\delta\\over \\delta\nJ(x)}\\big)\\exp(-Z_0[J])=\\exp(-Z_0[J+\\alpha_x])\n  $$ with $J$ the external source, and $\\alpha_x(y)=\\alpha\\delta(y-x)$. Such a\nshift is strictly related to the normal ordering of $\\exp(\\alpha\\phi)$ and to a\nscaling relation which follows by renormalizing $\\mu$. Next, we derive a new\nformulation of perturbation theory for the potentials $V(\\phi)={\\lambda\\over\nn!}:\\phi^n:$, using the generating functional associated to\n$:\\exp(\\alpha\\phi):$. The $\\Delta(0)$-terms related to the normal ordering are\nabsorbed at once. The functional derivatives with respect to $J$ to compute the\ngenerating functional are replaced by ordinary derivatives with respect to\nauxiliary parameters. We focus on scalar theories, but the method is general\nand similar investigations extend to other theories.\n", "  We present a detailed phenomenological analysis of the production of a\nStandard Model Higgs boson in association with up to three jets. We consider\nthe gluon fusion channel using an effective theory in the large top-quark mass\nlimit. Higgs boson production in gluon fusion constitutes an irreducible\nbackground to the vector boson fusion (VBF) process; hence the precise\nknowledge of its characteristics is a prerequisite for any measurement in the\nVBF channel. The calculation is carried out at next-to-leading order (NLO) in\nQCD in a fully automated way by combining the two programs GoSam and Sherpa. We\npresent numerical results for a large variety of observables for both standard\ncuts and VBF selection cuts. We find that for all jet multiplicities the NLO\ncorrections are sizeable. This is particularly true in the presence of\nkinematic selections enhancing the VBF topology, which are based on vetoing\nadditional jet activity. In this case, precise predictions for the background\ncan be made using our calculation by taking the difference between the\ninclusive H+2 jets and the inclusive H+3 jets result.\n", "  Motivated by recent experiments observing spin-orbit torque (SOT) acting on\nthe magnetization $\\vec{m}$ of a ferromagnetic (F) overlayer on the surface of\na three-dimensional topological insulator (TI), we investigate the origin of\nthe SOT and the magnetization dynamics in such systems. We predict that lateral\nF/TI bilayers of finite length, sandwiched between two normal metal leads, will\ngenerate a large antidamping-like SOT per very low charge current injected\nparallel to the interface. The large values of antidamping-like SOT are {\\it\nspatially localized} around the transverse edges of the F overlayer. Our\nanalysis is based on adiabatic expansion (to first order in $\\partial\n\\vec{m}/\\partial t$) of time-dependent nonequilibrium Green functions (NEGFs),\ndescribing electrons pushed out of equilibrium both by the applied bias voltage\nand by the slow variation of a classical degree of freedom [such as\n$\\vec{m}(t)$]. From it we extract formulas for spin torque and charge pumping,\nwhich show that they are reciprocal effects to each other, as well as Gilbert\ndamping in the presence of SO coupling. The NEGF-based formula for SOT\nnaturally splits into four components, determined by their behavior (even or\nodd) under the time and bias voltage reversal. Their complex angular dependence\nis delineated and employed within Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations of\nmagnetization dynamics in order to demonstrate capability of the predicted SOT\nto efficiently switch $\\vec{m}$ of a perpendicularly magnetized F overlayer.\n", "  It is proven that the relativistic quantum fields obtained from analytic\ncontinuation of convoluted generalized (L\\'evy type) noise fields have positive\nmetric, if and only if the noise is Gaussian. This follows as an easy\nobservation from a criterion by K. Baumann, based on the\nDell'Antonio-Robinson-Greenberg theorem, for a relativistic quantum field in\npositive metric to be a free field.\n", "  Non-uniform black strings (NUBS) are studied by the large $D$ effective\ntheory approach. By solving the near-horizon geometry in the $1/D$ expansion,\nwe obtain the effective equation for the deformed horizon up to the\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in $1/D$. We also solve the far-zone\ngeometry by the Newtonian approximation. Matching the near and far zones, the\nthermodynamic variables are computed in the $1/D$ expansion. As the result, the\nlarge $D$ analysis gives a critical dimension $D_*\\simeq13.5$ at which the\ntranslation-symmetry-breaking phase transition changes between first and second\norder. This value of $D_*$ agrees perfectly, within the precision of the $1/D$\nexpansion, with the result previously obtained by E. Sorkin through the\nnumerical resolution. We also compare our NNLO results for the thermodynamics\nof NUBS to earlier numerical calculations, and find good agreement within the\nexpected precision.\n", "  We compute the correlation function of three twist-2 operators in N = 4 SYM\nin the leading BFKL approximation at any N_c. In this limit, the result is\napplicable to other gauge theories, including QCD.\n", "  It is well-known that the quantum double $D(N\\subset M)$ of a finite depth\nsubfactor $N\\subset M$, or equivalently the Drinfeld center of the even part\nfusion category, is a unitary modular tensor category. Thus should arise in\nconformal field theory. We show that for every subfactor $N\\subset M$ with\nindex $[M:N]<4$ the quantum double $D(N\\subset M)$ is realized as the\nrepresentation category of a completely rational conformal net. In particular,\nthe quantum double of $E_6$ can be realized as a $\\mathbb Z_2$-simple current\nextension of $\\mathrm{SU}(2)_{10}\\times \\mathrm{Spin}(11)_1$ and thus is not\nexotic in any sense. As a byproduct we obtain a vertex operator algebra for\nevery such subfactor.\n  We obtain the result by showing that if a subfactor $N\\subset M $ arises from\n$\\alpha$-induction of completely rational nets $\\mathcal A\\subset \\mathcal B$\nand there is a net $\\tilde{\\mathcal A}$ with the opposite braiding, then the\nquantum $D(N\\subset M)$ is realized by completely rational net. We construct\ncompletely rational nets with the opposite braiding of $\\mathrm{SU}(2)_k$ and\nuse the well-known fact that all subfactors with index $[M:N]<4$ arise by\n$\\alpha$-induction from $\\mathrm{SU}(2)_k$.\n", "  D-branes have a world-volume U(1) gauge field A whose field strength F = dA\ngives rise to a Born-Infeld term in the D-brane action. Supersymmetry and kappa\nsymmetry transformations of A are traditionally inferred by the requirement\nthat the Born-Infeld term is consistent with both supersymmetry and kappa\nsymmetry of the D-brane action. In this paper, we show that integrability of\nthe assigned supersymmetry transformations leads to a extension of the standard\nsupersymmetry algebra that includes a fermionic central charge. We construct a\nsuperspace one-form on an enlarged superspace related by a coset construction\nto this centrally extended algebra whose supersymmetry and kappa symmetry\ntransformations are derived, rather than inferred. It is shown that under\npullback, these transformations are of the form expected for the D-brane U(1)\ngauge field. We relate these results to manifestly supersymmetric approaches to\nconstruction of D-brane actions.\n", "  Quantum mechanics is derived from the principle that the universe contain as\nmuch variety as possible, in the sense of maximizing the distinctiveness of\neach subsystem.\n  The quantum state of a microscopic system is defined to correspond to an\nensemble of subsystems of the universe with identical constituents and similar\npreparations and environments. A new kind of interaction is posited amongst\nsuch similar subsystems which acts to increase their distinctiveness, by\nextremizing the variety. In the limit of large numbers of similar subsystems\nthis interaction is shown to give rise to Bohm's quantum potential. As a result\nthe probability distribution for the ensemble is governed by the Schroedinger\nequation.\n  The measurement problem is naturally and simply solved. Microscopic systems\nappear statistical because they are members of large ensembles of similar\nsystems which interact non-locally. Macroscopic systems are unique, and are not\nmembers of any ensembles of similar systems. Consequently their collective\ncoordinates may evolve deterministically.\n  This proposal could be tested by constructing quantum devices from entangled\nstates of a modest number of quits which, by its combinatorial complexity, can\nbe expected to have no natural copies.\n", "  Ground-based exoplanet surveys such as SuperWASP, HATNet and KELT have\ndiscovered close to two hundred transiting extrasolar planets in the past\nseveral years. The strategy of these surveys is to look at a large field of\nview and measure the brightnesses of its bright stars to around half a percent\nper point precision, which is adequate for detecting hot Jupiters. Typically,\nthese surveys use CCD detectors to achieve high precision photometry. These\nCCDs, however, are expensive relative to other consumer-grade optical imaging\ndevices, such as digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLRs). We look at the\npossibility of using a digital single-lens reflex camera for precision\nphotometry. Specifically, we used a Canon EOS 60D camera that records light in\n3 colors simultaneously. The DSLR was integrated into the HATNet survey and\ncollected observations for a month, after which photometry was extracted for\n6600 stars in a selected stellar field. We found that the DSLR achieves a\nbest-case median absolute deviation (MAD) of 4.6 mmag per 180 s exposure when\nthe DSLR color channels are combined, and 1000 stars are measured to better\nthan 10 mmag (1%). Also, we achieve 10\\,mmag or better photometry in the\nindividual colors. This is good enough to detect transiting hot Jupiters. We\nperformed a candidate search on all stars and found four candidates, one of\nwhich is KELT-3b, the only known transiting hot Jupiter in our selected field.\nWe conclude that the Canon 60D is a cheap, lightweight device capable of useful\nphotometry in multiple colors.\n", "  This document outlines a set of simplified models for dark matter and its\ninteractions with Standard Model particles. It is intended to summarize the\nmain characteristics that these simplified models have when applied to dark\nmatter searches at the LHC, and to provide a number of useful expressions for\nreference. The list of models includes both s-channel and t-channel scenarios.\nFor s-channel, spin-0 and spin-1 mediation is discussed, and also realizations\nwhere the Higgs particle provides a portal between the dark and visible\nsectors. The guiding principles underpinning the proposed simplified models are\nspelled out, and some suggestions for implementation are presented.\n", "  We experimentally studied the dynamics of optically excited hotspots in\ncurrent carrying WSi superconducting nanowires as a function of bias current,\nbath temperature and excitation wavelength. We discovered that: (1) the hotspot\nrelaxation is a factor of ~ 4 slower in WSi than in NbN; (2) the hotspot\nrelaxation time depends on bias current, and (3) the current dependence of the\nhotspot relaxation time changes with temperature and wavelength. We explained\nall of these effects with a model based on quasi particle recombination.\n", "  Very often, when studying topological or dynamical properties of random\nscale-free networks, it is tacitly assumed that degree-degree correlations are\nnot present. However, simple constraints, such as the absence of multiple edges\nand self-loops, can give rise to intrinsic correlations in these structures. In\nthe same way that Fermionic correlations in thermodynamic systems are relevant\nonly in the limit of low temperature, the intrinsic correlations in scale-free\nnetworks are relevant only when the extreme values for the degrees grow faster\nthan the square-root of the network size. In this situation, these correlations\ncan significantly affect the dependence of the average degree of the nearest\nneighbors of a given vertice on this vertices's degree. Here, we introduce an\nanalytical approach that is capable to predict the functional form of this\nproperty. Moreover, our results indicate that random scale-free networks models\nare not self-averaging, that is, the second moment of their degree distribution\nmay vary orders of magnitude among different realizations. Finally, we argue\nthat the intrinsic correlations investigated here may have profound impact on\nthe critical properties of random scale-free networks.\n", "  We revisit the problem of quark production in high energy heavy ion\ncollisions, at leading order in $\\alpha_s$ in the color glass condensate\nframework. In this first paper, we setup the formalism and express the quark\nspectrum in terms of a set of mode functions of the Dirac equation. We\ndetermine analytically their initial value in the Fock-Schwinger gauge on a\nproper time surface $Q_s\\tau_0\\ll 1$, in a basis which makes manifest the boost\ninvariance properties of this problem. We also describe a statistical algorithm\nto perform the sampling of the mode functions.\n", "  Resonant graphene dopants, such as hydrogen adatoms, experience long-range\neffective interaction mediated by conduction electrons. As a result of this\ninteraction, when several adatoms are present in the sample, hopping of adatoms\nbetween sites belonging to different sublattices involves significant energy\nchanges. Different inelastic mechanisms facilitating such hopping -- coupling\nto phonons and conduction electrons -- are considered. It is estimated that the\ndiffusion of hydrogen adatoms is rather slow, amounting to roughly one hop to a\nnearest neighbor per millisecond.\n", "  We generalise the Jacob-Wick helicity formalism, which applies to sequential\ndecays, to effective field theories of rare decays of the type $B \\to\nK_{J_K}(\\to K \\pi) \\bar{\\ell}_1 \\ell_2$. This is achieved by reinterpreting\nlocal interaction vertices $\\bar b \\Gamma'_{\\mu_1 ..\\mu_n} s \\bar \\ell\n\\Gamma^{\\mu_1 ..\\mu_n} \\ell$ as a coherent sum of $1 \\to 2$ processes mediated\nby particles whose spin ranges between zero and $n$. We illustrate the\nframework by deriving the full angular distributions for $B \\to K\\bar{\\ell}_1\n\\ell_2$ and $B \\to K^*(\\to K \\pi) \\bar{\\ell}_1 \\ell_2$ for the complete\ndimension-six effective Hamiltonian for non-equal lepton masses. Amplitudes and\ndecay rates are expressed in terms of Wigner rotation matrices, leading\nnaturally to the method of moments in various forms. We discuss how higher-spin\noperators and QED corrections alter the standard angular distribution used\nthroughout the literature, potentially leading to differences between the\nmethod of moments and the likelihood fits. We propose to diagnose these effects\nby assessing higher angular moments. These could be relevant in investigating\nthe nature of the current LHCb anomalies in $R_K = {\\cal B}( B \\to K\n\\mu^+\\mu^-) /{\\cal B}( B \\to K e^+e^-)$ as well as angular observables in $B\n\\to K^* \\mu^+\\mu^-$.\n", "  In the study of 1D nonlinear Hamiltonian lattices, the conserved quantities\nplay an important role in determining the actual behavior of heat conduction.\nBesides the total energy, total momentum and total stretch could also be\nconserved quantities. In microcanonical Hamiltonian dynamics, the total energy\nis always conserved. It was recently argued by Das and Dhar that whenever\nstretch (momentum) is not conserved in a 1D model, the momentum (stretch) and\nenergy fields exhibit normal diffusion. In this work, we will systematically\ninvestigate the stretch diffusions for typical 1D nonlinear lattices. No clear\nconnection between the conserved quantities and heat conduction can be\nestablished. The actual situation is more complicated than what Das and Dhar\nclaimed.\n", "  This report reviews the study of open heavy-flavour and quarkonium production\nin high-energy hadronic collisions, as tools to investigate fundamental aspects\nof Quantum Chromodynamics, from the proton and nucleus structure at high energy\nto deconfinement and the properties of the Quark-Gluon Plasma. Emphasis is\ngiven to the lessons learnt from LHC Run 1 results, which are reviewed in a\nglobal picture with the results from SPS and RHIC at lower energies, as well as\nto the questions to be addressed in the future. The report covers heavy flavour\nand quarkonium production in proton-proton, proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions. This includes discussion of the effects of hot and cold strongly\ninteracting matter, quarkonium photo-production in nucleus-nucleus collisions\nand perspectives on the study of heavy flavour and quarkonium with upgrades of\nexisting experiments and new experiments. The report results from the activity\nof the SaporeGravis network of the I3 Hadron Physics programme of the European\nUnion 7th Framework Programme.\n", "  In a previous article, \\cite{Zill3}, we have established linear inviscid\ndamping for a large class of monotone shear flows in a finite periodic channel\nand have further shown that boundary effects asymptotically lead to the\nformation of singularities of derivatives of the solution. As the main results\nof this article, we provide a detailed description of the singularity formation\nand establish stability in all sub-critical fractional Sobolev spaces and\nblow-up in all super-critical spaces. Furthermore, we discuss the implications\nof the blow-up to the problem of nonlinear inviscid damping in a finite\nperiodic channel, where high regularity would be essential to control nonlinear\neffects.\n", "  Geo-Synchronous orbits are appealing for Solar or astrophysical observatories\nbecause they permit continuous data downlink at high rates. The radiation\nenvironment in these orbits presents unique challenges, however. This paper\ndescribes both the characteristics of the radiation environment in\nGeo-Synchronous orbit and the mechanisms by which this radiation generates\nbackgrounds in photon detectors. Shielding considerations are described, and a\npreliminary shielding design for the proposed Wide-Field InfraRed Survey\nTelescope observatory is presented as a reference for future space telescope\nconcept studies that consider a Geo-Synchronous orbit.\n", "  We study linear functionals on a Clifford algebra (algebra of Ma- joranas)\nequipped with a reflection automorphism. For Hamiltonians that are functions of\nMajoranas or of spins, we find necessary and sufficient conditions on the\ncoupling constants for reflection positivity to hold. One can easily check\nthese conditions in concrete models. We illustrate this by discussing a number\nof spin systems with nearest-neighbor and long-range interactions.\n", "  Classical chemical kinetics use rate-equation models to describe how a\nreaction proceeds in time. Such models are sufficient for describing state\ntransitions in a reaction where coherences between different states do not\narise, or in other words, a reaction which contain only incoherent transitions.\nA prominent example reaction containing coherent transitions is the\nradical-pair model. The kinetics of such reactions is defined by the so-called\nreaction operator which determines the radical-pair state as a function of\nintermediate transition rates. We argue that the well-known concept of quantum\nwalks from quantum information theory is a natural and apt framework for\ndescribing multisite chemical reactions. By composing Kraus maps that act only\non two sites at a time, we show how the quantum-walk formalism can be applied\nto derive a reaction operator for the standard avian radical-pair reaction. Our\nreaction operator predicts a recombination dephasing rate consistent with\nrecent experiments [J. Chem. Phys. {\\bf 139}, 234309 (2013)], in contrast to\nprevious work by Jones and Hore [Chem. Phys. Lett. {\\bf 488}, 90 (2010)]. The\nstandard radical-pair reaction has conventionally been described by either a\nnormalised density operator incorporating both the radical pair and reaction\nproducts, or by a trace-decreasing density operator that considers only the\nradical pair. We demonstrate a density operator that is both normalised and\nrefers only to radical-pair states. Generalisations to include additional\ndephasing processes and an arbitrary number of sites are also discussed.\n", "  Thermoelectric transport in strongly spin-orbit coupled two-dimensional\nRashba system is studied using the exact solution of the linearized Boltzmann\nequation. Some unusual transport behaviors are revealed. We show that the\nelectrical conductivity takes a Drude form when the Fermi energy $E_{F}$ is\nabove the band crossing point, but a non-Drude form which is a quadratic\nfunction of $E_{F}$ when $E_{F}$ lies below the band crossing point. The Mott\nrelation breaks down when $E_{F}$ lies in the vicinity of the band crossing\npoint. It is shown that the thermopower and thermoelectric figure of merit are\nstrongly enhanced when $E_{F}$ downs below the band crossing point. This\nenhancement is attributed to not only the one-dimensional-like density of state\nbut also the unconventional intraband elastic scattering below the band\ncrossing point. The differences between these results and those obtained by the\nrelaxation time approximation are discussed in detail.\n", "  The inter-band optical absorption in graphene characterized by its\nfine-structure constant has a universal value of 2.3\\% independent of the\nmaterial parameters. However, for several graphene-based photonic applications,\nenhanced optical absorption in graphene is highly desired. In this work, we\nquantify the tunability of optical absorption in graphene via the Fermi level\nin graphene, angle of incidence of the incident polarized light, and the\ndielectric constant of the surrounding dielectric media in which graphene is\nembedded. The influence of impurities adsorbed on the surface of graphene on\nthe Lorentzian broadening of the spectral function of the density of states is\nanalytically evaluated within the equilibrium Green's function formalism.\nFinally, we compute the differential absorption of right and left\ncircularly-polarized light in graphene that is uniaxially and optically\nstrained. The preferential absorption or circular dichroism is investigated for\narmchair and zigzag strain.\n", "  Inspired by the appearance of split-complex structures in the dimensional\nreduction of string theory, and in the theories emerging as byproducts, we\nstudy the hyper-complex formulation of Abelian gauge field theories, by\nincorporating a new complex unit to the usual complex one. The hypercomplex\nversion of the traditional Mexican hat potential associated with the $U(1)$\ngauge field theory, corresponds to a {\\it hybrid} potential with two real\ncomponents, and with $U(1)\\times SO(1,1)$ as symmetry group. Each component\ncorresponds to a deformation of the hat potential, with the appearance of a new\ndegenerate vacuum. Hypercomplex electrodynamics will show novel properties,\nsuch as the spontaneous symmetry breaking scenarios with running masses for the\nvectorial and scalar Higgs fields, and the Aharonov-Bohm type strings defects\nas exact solutions; these topological defects may be detected only by quantum\ninterference of charged particles through gauge invariant loop integrals. In a\nparticular limit, the {\\it hyperbolic} electrodynamics does not admit\ntopological defects associated with continuous symmetries\n", "  The aim of this work is to find exact solutions of the one-dimensional Dirac\nequation that do not belong to the already known conventional class. We write\nthe spinor wavefunction as a bounded infinite sum in a complete basis set,\nwhich is chosen such that the matrix representation of the Dirac wave operator\nbecomes tridiagonal and symmetric. This makes the wave equation equivalent to a\nsymmetric three-term recursion relation for the expansion coefficients of the\nwavefunction. We solve the recursion relation and obtain the relativistic\nenergy spectrum and corresponding state functions. Restriction to the diagonal\nrepresentation results in the conventional class of solutions. As illustration,\nwe consider the square well with half-sine potential bottom in the vector and\nscalar coupling under spin symmetry. We obtain the relativistic energy spectrum\nand show that the nonrelativistic limit agrees with results found elsewhere.\n", "  The abundance of infrared singularities in gauge theories due to unresolved\nemission of massless particles (soft and collinear) represents the main\ndifficulty in perturbative calculations. They are typically regularized in\ndimensional regularization, and their subtraction is usually achieved\nindependently for virtual and real corrections. In this paper, we introduce a\nnew method based on the loop-tree duality (LTD) theorem to accomplish the\nsummation over degenerate infrared states directly at the integrand level such\nthat the cancellation of the infrared divergences is achieved simultaneously,\nand apply it to reference examples as a proof of concept. Ultraviolet\ndivergences, which are the consequence of the point-like nature of the theory,\nare also reinterpreted physically in this framework. The proposed method opens\nthe intriguing possibility of carrying out purely four-dimensional\nimplementations of higher-order perturbative calculations at next-to-leading\norder (NLO) and beyond free of soft and final-state collinear subtractions.\n", "  We consider a zigzag chain of coupled micropillar cavities, taking into\naccount the polarization of polariton states. We show that the TE-TM splitting\nof photonic cavity modes yields topologically protected polariton edge states.\nDuring the strongly non-adiabatic process of polariton condensation, the\nKibble-Zurek mechanism leads to a random choice of polarization, equivalent to\ndimerization of polymer chains. We show that dark-bright solitons appear as\ndomain walls between polarization domains, analogous to the\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger solitons in polymers. The soliton density scales as a\npower law with respect to the quenching parameter.\n", "  We analyze idealized sequential Stern-Gerlach experiments with higher spin\nparticles. This analysis serves at least two purposes: The widely discussed\nspin-1/2 case leads to some misunderstandings which hopefully is removed by the\nhigher spin discussion. Secondly, Wigner rotation matrices for generic spins\nbecome conceptually more transparent with this physical example. We also give\ncompact formulas for the probabilities in terms of the angle between the\nsequential SG apparatuses for generic spins. We work out the spin-$1/2$,\nspin-$1$ and spin-$2$ cases explicitly. Since there are some confusing issues\nregarding the actual experiment, we also compile a \"facts and fiction\" section\non the SG experiments.\n", "  We describe a new approach to computing the chiral part of correlation\nfunctions of stress-tensor supermultiplets in N=4 SYM that relies on\nsymmetries, analytic properties and the structure of the OPE only. We\ndemonstrate that the correlation functions are given by a linear combination of\nchiral N=4 superconformal invariants accompanied by coefficient functions\ndepending on the space-time coordinates only. We present the explicit\nconstruction of these invariants and show that the six-point correlation\nfunction is fixed in the Born approximation up to four constant coefficients by\nits symmetries. In addition, the known asymptotic structure of the correlation\nfunction in the light-like limit fixes unambiguously these coefficients up to\nan overall normalization. We demonstrate that the same approach can be applied\nto obtain a representation for the six-point NMHV amplitude that is free from\nany auxiliary gauge fixing parameters, does not involve spurious poles and\nmanifests half of the dual superconformal symmetry.\n", "  We assess the potential of two-terminal graphene-hBN-graphene resonant\ntunneling diodes as high-frequency oscillators, using self-consistent quantum\ntransport and electrostatic simulations to determine the time-dependent\nresponse of the diodes in a resonant circuit. We quantify how the frequency and\npower of the current oscillations depend on the diode and circuit parameters\nincluding the doping of the graphene electrodes, device geometry, alignment of\nthe graphene lattices, and the circuit impedances. Our results indicate that\ncurrent oscillations with frequencies of up to several hundred GHz should be\nachievable.\n", "  We present the results of an imaging observation campaign conducted with the\nSubaru Telescope adaptive optics system (IRCS+AO188) on 28 gravitationally\nlensed quasars (23 doubles, 1 quad, and 1 possible triple, and 3 candidates)\nfrom the SDSS Quasar Lens Search. We develop a novel modelling technique that\nfits analytical and hybrid point spread functions (PSFs), while simultaneously\nmeasuring the relative astrometry, photometry, as well as the lens galaxy\nmorphology. We account for systematics by simulating the observed systems using\nseparately observed PSF stars. The measured relative astrometry is comparable\nwith that typically achieved with the Hubble Space Telescope, even after\nmarginalizing over the PSF uncertainty. We model for the first time the quasar\nhost galaxies in 5 systems, without a-priory knowledge of the PSF, and show\nthat their luminosities follow the known correlation with the mass of the\nsupermassive black hole. For each system, we obtain mass models far more\naccurate than those previously published from low-resolution data, and we show\nthat in our sample of lensing galaxies the observed light profile is more\nelliptical than the mass, for ellipticity > 0.25. We also identify eight\ndoubles for which the sources of external and internal shear are more reliably\nseparated, and should therefore be prioritized in monitoring campaigns aimed at\nmeasuring time-delays in order to infer the Hubble constant.\n", "  Recently, diagrammatic extensions of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) have\nbeen proposed for including short- and long-range correlations beyond DMFT on\nan equal footing. We employ one of these, the dynamical vertex approximation\n(D$\\Gamma$A), and study the two-dimensional Hubbard model on a square lattice.\nWe define two transition lines in the phase diagram which correspond,\nrespectively, to the opening of the gap in the nodal direction and throughout\nthe Fermi surface. Our self-energy data show that the evolution between the two\nregimes occurs in a gradual way (crossover) and also that at low enough\ntemperatures the whole Fermi surface is always gapped. Furthermore, we present\na comparison of our D$\\Gamma$A calculations at a parameter set where data\nobtained by other techniques are available.\n", "  We prove localization and probabilistic bounds on the minimum level spacing\nfor a random block Anderson model without monotonicity. Using a sequence of\nnarrowing energy windows and associated Schur complements, we obtain detailed\nprobabilistic information about the microscopic structure of energy levels of\nthe Hamiltonian, as well as the support and decay of eigenfunctions.\n", "  Bosonic cascades formed by lattices of equidistant energy levels sustaining\nradiative transitions between nearest layers are promising for the generation\nof coherent terahertz radiation. We show how, also for the light emitted by the\ncondensates in the visible range, they introduce new regimes of emission.\nNamely, the quantum statistics of bosonic cascades exhibit super-bunching\nplateaus. This demonstrates further potentialities of bosonic cascade lasers\nfor the engineering of quantum properties of light useful for imaging\napplications.\n", "  Multiple terrestrial and space-based telescopes have been proposed for\ndetecting and tracking near-Earth objects (NEOs). Detailed simulations of the\nsearch performance of these systems have used complex computer codes that are\nnot widely available, which hinders accurate cross-comparison of the proposals\nand obscures whether they have consistent assumptions. Moreover, some proposed\ninstruments would survey infrared (IR) bands, whereas others would operate in\nthe visible band, and differences among asteroid thermal and visible light\nmodels used in the simulations further complicate like-to-like comparisons. I\nuse simple physical principles to estimate basic performance metrics for the\nground-based Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and three space-based instruments\n- Sentinel, NEOCam, and a Cubesat constellation. The performance is measured\nagainst two different NEO distributions, the Bottke et al. distribution of\ngeneral NEOs, and the Veres et al. distribution of Earth impacting NEO. The\nresults of the comparison show simplified relative performance metrics,\nincluding the expected number of NEOs visible in the search volumes and the\ninitial detection rates expected for each system. Although these simplified\ncomparisons do not capture all of the details, they give considerable insight\ninto the physical factors limiting performance. Multiple asteroid thermal\nmodels are considered, including FRM, NEATM, and a new generalized form of FRM\n(GFRM). I describe issues with how IR albedo and emissivity have been estimated\nin previous studies, which may render them inaccurate. A thermal model for\ntumbling asteroids is also developed and suggests that tumbling asteroids may\nbe surprisingly difficult for IR telescopes to observe.\n", "  Thermal noise is a limiting factor in many high-precision optical\nexperiments. A search is underway for novel optical materials with reduced\nthermal noise. One such pair of materials, gallium arsenide and\naluminum-alloyed gallium arsenide (collectively referred to as AlGaAs), shows\npromise for its low Brownian noise when compared to conventional materials such\nas silica and tantala. However, AlGaAs has the potential to produce a high\nlevel of thermo-optic noise. We have fabricated a set of AlGaAs crystalline\ncoatings, transferred to fused silica substrates, whose layer structure has\nbeen optimized to reduce thermo-optic noise by inducing coherent cancellation\nof the thermoelastic and thermorefractive effects. By measuring the\nphotothermal transfer function of these mirrors, we find evidence that this\noptimization has been successful.\n", "  The reduced dynamics for dark and bright soliton chains in the\none-dimensional nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation is used to study the behavior\nof collective compression waves. For appropriate conditions, the reduced\ndynamics derived from perturbation and variational techniques allows to\ndescribe a chain of dark or bright solitons as a chain of effective masses\nconnected by nonlinear springs taking the form of a Toda lattice model on the\nsoliton's positions. In turn, the Toda lattice possesses exact solitary\ntravelling compression wave solutions corresponding to travelling compression\nwaves in the original soliton chain. We coin the term hypersoliton to describe\nsuch solitary waves riding on a chain of solitons. We corroborate our\nanalytical results with direct numerical simulations of the nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. It is observed that in the case of dark soliton chains,\nthe formulated reduction dynamics provides an accurate description for the\nrobust evolution of travelling compression waves. In contrast, bright soliton\nchains do not have such stable propagating solutions due to the\ndesynchronization of the mutual phases between consecutive solitons during\nevolution. Finally, as an application to Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in a\nstandard external harmonic trapping potential, we study the case of finite dark\nsoliton chain confined at the center of the trap. We find that when the central\nchain is hit by a dark soliton initiated at the edge of the external trap, the\nenergy is transferred through the chain as a hypersoliton. When the\nhypersoliton reaches the end of the central chain, a dark soliton is ejected\naway from the center of the trap and, as it returns from its excursion up the\ntrap, hits the central chain producing again a hypersoliton. This periodic\nevolution is the equivalent of the classical Newton's cradle.\n", "  We consider the effect of evaporation on the aggregation of a number of\nelastic objects due to a liquid's surface tension. In particular, we consider\nan array of spring--block elements in which the gaps between blocks are filled\nby thin liquid films that evaporate during the course of an experiment. Using\nlubrication theory to account for the fluid flow within the gaps, we study the\ndynamics of aggregation. We find that a non-zero evaporation rate causes the\nelements to aggregate more quickly and, indeed, to contact within finite time.\nHowever, we also show that the number of elements within each cluster decreases\nas the evaporation rate increases. We explain these results quantitatively by\ncomparison with the corresponding two-body problem and discuss their relevance\nfor controlling pattern formation in elastocapillary systems.\n", "  This article proposes a fundamental methodological shift in the modelling of\npolicy interventions for sustainability transitions in order to account for\ncomplexity (e.g. self-reinforcing mechanism arising from multi-agent\ninteractions) and agent heterogeneity (e.g. differences in consumer and\ninvestment behaviour). We first characterise the uncertainty faced by climate\npolicy-makers and its implications for investment decision-makers. We then\nidentify five shortcomings in the equilibrium and optimisation-based approaches\nmost frequently used to inform sustainability policy: (i) their normative,\noptimisation-based nature, (ii) their unrealistic reliance on the\nfull-rationality of agents, (iii) their inability to account for mutual\ninfluences among agents and capture related self-reinforcing (positive\nfeedback) processes, (iv) their inability to represent multiple solutions and\npath-dependency, and (v) their inability to properly account for agent\nheterogeneity. The aim of this article is to introduce an alternative modelling\napproach based on complexity dynamics and agent heterogeneity, and explore its\nuse in four key areas of sustainability policy, namely (1) technology adoption\nand diffusion, (2) macroeconomic impacts of low-carbon policies, (3)\ninteractions between the socio-economic system and the natural environment, and\n(4) the anticipation of policy outcomes. The practical relevance of the\nproposed methodology is discussed by reference to four applications: the\ndiffusion of transport technology, the impact of low-carbon investment on\nincome and employment, the management of cascading uncertainties, and the\ncross-sectoral impact of biofuels policies. The article calls for a fundamental\nmethodological shift aligning the modelling of the socio-economic system with\nthat of the climatic system, for a combined and realistic understanding of the\nimpact of sustainability policies.\n", "  Alday, Gaiotto, and Tachikawa conjectured relations between certain 4d N=2\nsupersymmetric field theories and 2d Liouville conformal field theory. We study\ngeneralizations of these relations to 4d theories with surface operators. For\none type of surface operators the corresponding 2d theory is the WZW model, and\nfor another type - the Liouville theory with insertions of extra degenerate\nfields. We show that these two 4d theories with surface operators exhibit an IR\nduality, which reflects the known relation (the so-called separation of\nvariables) between the conformal blocks of the WZW model and the Liouville\ntheory. Furthermore, we trace this IR duality to a brane creation construction\nrelating systems of M5 and M2 branes in M-theory. Finally, we show that this\nduality may be expressed as an explicit relation between the generating\nfunctions for the changes of variables between natural sets of Darboux\ncoordinates on the Hitchin moduli space.\n", "  Small- and intermediate-scale galaxy clustering can be used to establish the\ngalaxy-halo connection to study galaxy formation and evolution and to tighten\nconstraints on cosmological parameters. With the increasing precision of galaxy\nclustering measurements from ongoing and forthcoming large galaxy surveys,\naccurate models are required to interpret the data and extract relevant\ninformation. We introduce a method based on high-resolution N-body simulations\nto accurately and efficiently model the galaxy two-point correlation functions\n(2PCFs) in projected and redshift spaces. The basic idea is to tabulate all\ninformation of haloes in the simulations necessary for computing the galaxy\n2PCFs within the framework of halo occupation distribution or conditional\nluminosity function. It is equivalent to populating galaxies to dark matter\nhaloes and using the mock 2PCF measurements as the model predictions. Besides\nthe accurate 2PCF calculations, the method is also fast and therefore enables\nan efficient exploration of the parameter space. As an example of the method,\nwe decompose the redshift-space galaxy 2PCF into different components based on\nthe type of galaxy pairs and show the redshift-space distortion effect in each\ncomponent. The generalizations and limitations of the method are discussed.\n", "  Large-scale structure surveys in the coming years will measure the\nredshift-space power spectrum to unprecedented accuracy, allowing for powerful\nnew tests of the LambdaCDM picture as well as measurements of particle physics\nparameters such as the neutrino masses. We extend the Time-RG perturbative\nframework to redshift space, computing the power spectrum P_s(k,mu) in massive\nneutrino cosmologies with time-dependent dark energy equations of state w(z).\nTime-RG is uniquely capable of incorporating scale-dependent growth into the\nP_s(k,mu) computation, which is important for massive neutrinos as well as\nmodified gravity models. Although changes to w(z) and the neutrino mass\nfraction both affect the late-time scale-dependence of the non-linear power\nspectrum, we find that the two effects depend differently on the line-of-sight\nangle mu. Finally, we use the HACC N-body code to quantify errors in the\nperturbative calculations. For a LambdaCDM model at redshift z=1, our procedure\npredicts the monopole~(quadrupole) to 1% accuracy up to a wave number 0.19h/Mpc\n(0.28h/Mpc), compared to 0.08h/Mpc (0.07h/Mpc) for the Kaiser approximation and\n0.19h/Mpc (0.16h/Mpc) for the current state-of-the-art perturbation scheme. Our\ncalculation agrees with the simulated redshift-space power spectrum even for\nneutrino masses above the current bound, and for rapidly-evolving dark energy\nequations of state, |dw/dz| ~ 1. Along with this article, we make our\nredshift-space Time-RG implementation publicly available as the code redTime.\n", "  In our previous paper, we provided general effective Higgs interactions for\nthe lightest Higgs boson $h$ (SM-like) and a heavier neutral Higgs boson $H$\nbased on the effective Lagrangian formulation up to the dim-6 interactions, and\nthen proposed two sensitive processes for probing $H$. We showed in several\nexamples that the resonance peak of $H$ and its dim-6 effective coupling\nconstants (ECC) can be detected at the LHC Run 2 with reasonable integrated\nluminosity. In this paper, we further perform a more thorough study of the most\nsensitive process, $pp\\to VH^\\ast\\to VVV$, on the information about the\nrelations between the $1\\sigma,\\,3\\sigma,\\,5\\sigma$ statistical significance\nand the corresponding ranges of the Higgs ECC for an integrated luminosity of\n100 fb$^{-1}$. These results have two useful applications in the LHC Run 2: (A)\nrealizing the experimental determination of the ECC in the dim-6 interactions\nif $H$ is found and, (B) obtaining the theoretical exclusion bounds if $H$ is\nnot found. Some alternative processes sensitive for certain ranges of the ECC\nare also analyzed.\n", "  We consider the simplest classical integrable model corresponding to a\nnon-hyperelliptic spectral curve. We show that a certain complicated integral\noccurs when computing the average of observables in this model. This integral\ndoes not factorise. Since similar problems should also exist in the quantum\ncase, we think that a serious question arises of how to deal with these\nintegrals.\n", "  Cold gas entering the central $1$ to $10^2$ pc of a galaxy fragments and\ncondenses into clouds. The stability of the clouds determines whether they will\nbe turned into stars or can be delivered to the central supermassive black hole\n(SMBH) to turn on an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The conventional criteria\nto assess the stability of these clouds, such as the Jeans criterion and Roche\n(or tidal) limit, are insufficient here, because they assume the dominance of\nself-gravity in binding a cloud, and neglect external agents, such as pressure\nand tidal forces, which are common in galactic nuclei. We formulate a new\nscheme for judging this stability. We first revisit the conventional Virial\ntheorem, taking into account an external pressure, to identify the correct\nrange of masses that lead to stable clouds. We then extend the theorem to\ninclude an external tidal field, crucial for the stability in the region of\ninterest -- in dense star clusters, around SMBHs. We apply our extended Virial\ntheorem to find the correct solutions to practical problems that until now were\ncontroversial, namely, the stability of the gas clumps in AGN tori, the\ncircum-nuclear disk in the Galactic Center, and the central molecular zone of\nthe Milky Way. The masses we derive for these structures are orders of\nmagnitude smaller than the commonly-used Virial masses (equivalent to the Jeans\nmass). Moreover, we prove that these clumps are stable, contrary to what one\nwould naively deduce from the Roche (tidal) limit.\n", "  We extend the method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics to investigate\ndineutron correlation. We apply this method to $^{10}$Be as an example and\ninvestigate the motion of two neutrons around a largely deformed $^8$Be core by\nanalyzing the two-neutron overlap function around the core. We show that the\ncore structure plays an important role in dineutron formation and expansion\nfrom the core and that the present framework is effective for the studies of\ndineutron correlation.\n", "  We study the graviton scattering in the background of non-susy D$p$ branes of\ntype II string theories consisting of a metric, a dilaton and a $(p+1)$ form\ngauge field. We show numerically that in these backgrounds graviton experiences\na scattering potential which takes the form of an infinite barrier in the low\nenergy (near brane) limit for $p\\leq 5$ and therefore is never able to reach\nthe branes. This shows, contrary to what is known in the literature, that\ngravity indeed decouples from the non-susy D$p$ branes for $p \\leq 5$. For\nnon-susy D6 brane, gravity couples as there is no such barrier for the\npotential. To give further credence to our claim we solve the scattering\nequation in some situation analytically and calculate the graviton absorption\ncross-sections on the non-susy branes and show that they vanish for $p \\leq 4$\nin the low energy limit. This shows, as in the case of BPS branes, that gravity\ndoes decouple for non-susy D$p$ branes for $p\\leq 4$ but it does not decouple\nfor D6 brane as the potential here is always attractive. We argue for the\nnon-susy D5 brane that depending on one of the parameters of the solution\ngravity either always decouples (unlike the BPS D5 brane) or it decouples when\nthe energy of the graviton is below certain critical value, otherwise it\ncouples, very similar to BPS D5 brane.\n", "  We develop a mathematical model for the energy landscape of polyhedral\nsupramolecular cages recently synthesized by self-assembly [Sun et al., Science\n2010]. Our model includes two essential features of the experiment: (i)\ngeometry of the organic ligands and metallic ions; and (ii) combinatorics. The\nmolecular geometry is used to introduce an energy that favors square-planar\nvertices (modeling $\\mathrm{Pd}^{2+}$ ions) and bent edges with one of two\npreferred opening angles (modeling boomerang-shaped ligands of two types). The\ncombinatorics of the model involve $2$-colorings of edges of polyhedra with\n$4$-valent vertices. The set of such $2$-colorings, quotiented by the\noctahedral symmetry group, has a natural graph structure, and is called the\ncombinatorial configuration space. The energy landscape of our model is the\nenergy of each state in the combinatorial configuration space.\n  The challenge in the computation of the energy landscape is a combinatorial\nexplosion in the number of $2$-colorings of edges. We describe sampling methods\nbased on the symmetries of the configurations and connectivity of the\nconfiguration graph. When the two preferred opening angles encompass the\ngeometrically ideal angle, the energy landscape exhibits a very low-energy\nminimum for the most symmetric configuration at equal mixing of the two angles,\neven when the average opening angle does not match the ideal angle.\n", "  The Random Particle Mesh (RPM) method used to simulate turbulence-induced\nbroadband noise in several aeroacoustic applications is extended to realise\nisotropic turbulence spectra. With this method turbulent fluctuations are\nsynthesised by filtering white noise with a Gaussian filter kernel that in turn\ngives a Gaussian spectrum. The Gaussian function is smooth and its derivatives\nand integrals are again Gaussian functions. The Gaussian filter is efficient\nand finds wide-spread applications in stochastic signal processing. However in\nmany applications Gaussian spectra do not correspond to real turbulence\nspectra. Thus in turbo-machines the von K\\'arm\\'an, Liepmann, and modified von\nK\\'arm\\'an spectra are more realistic model spectra. In this note we\nanalytically derive weighting functions to realise arbitrary isotropic\nsolenoidal spectra using a superposition of weighted Gaussian spectra of\ndifferent length scales. The analytic weighting functions for the von\nK\\'arm\\'an, the Liepmann, and the modified von K\\'arm\\'an spectra are derived\nsubsequently. Finally a method is proposed to discretise the problem using a\nlimited number of Gaussian spectra. The effectivity of this approach is\ndemonstrated by realising a von K\\'arm\\'an velocity spectrum using the RPM\nmethod.\n", "  Supermanifolds provide a very natural ground to understand and handle\nsupersymmetry from a geometric point of view; supersymmetry in $d=3,4,6$ and\n$10$ dimensions is also deeply related to the normed division algebras.\n  In this paper we want to show the link between the conformal group and\ncertain types of symplectic transformations over division algebras. Inspired by\nthis observation we then propose a new\\,realization of the real form of the 4\ndimensional conformal and Minkowski superspaces we obtain, respectively, as a\nLagrangian supermanifold over the twistor superspace $\\mathbb{C}^{4|1}$ and a\nbig cell inside it.\n  The beauty of this approach is that it naturally generalizes to the 6\ndimensional case (and possibly also to the 10 dimensional one) thus providing\nan elegant and uniform characterization of the conformal superspaces.\n", "  A search is performed for heavy long-lived charged particles using 3.0\nfb$^{-1}$ of pp collisions collected at $\\sqrt{s}$= 7 and 8 TeV with the LHCb\ndetector. The search is mainly based on the response of the ring imaging\nCherenkovdetectors to distinguish the heavy, slow-moving particles from muons.\nNo evidence is found for the production of such long-lived states. The results\nare expressed as limits on the Drell-Yan production of pairs of long-lived\nparticles, with both particles in the LHCb pseudorapidity acceptance, $1.8 <\n\\eta < 4.9$. The mass-dependent cross-section upper limits are in the range 2-4\nfb (at 95\\% CL) for masses between 124 and 309 GeV/c$^2$.\n", "  We obtain new supersymmetric flux vacua of type II supergravities on\nfour-dimensional Minkowski times six-dimensional solvmanifolds. The orientifold\nO4, O5, O6, O7, or O8-planes and D-branes are localized. All vacua are in\naddition not T-dual to a vacuum on the torus. The corresponding solvmanifolds\nare proven to be Calabi-Yau, with explicit metrics. Other Ricci flat\nsolvmanifolds are shown to be only K\\\"ahler.\n", "  The Generalized Minimal Massive Gravity (GMMG) theory is realized by adding\nthe CS deformation term, the higher derivative deformation term, and an extra\nterm to pure Einstein gravity with a negative cosmological constant. In the\npresent paper we obtain exact solutions to the GMMG field equations in the\nnon-linear regime of the model. GMMG model about $AdS_3$ space is conjectured\nto be dual to a 2-dimensional CFT. We study the theory in critical points\ncorresponding to the central charges $c_-=0$ or $c_+=0$, in the non-linear\nregime. We show that $AdS_3$ wave solutions are present, and have logarithmic\nform in critical points. Then we study the $AdS_3$ non-linear deformation\nsolution. Furthermore we obtain logarithmic deformation of extremal BTZ black\nhole. After that using Abbott-Deser-Tekin method we calculate the energy and\nangular momentum of these types of black hole solutions.\n", "  Quantum entanglement emerges naturally in interacting quantum systems and\nplays a central role in quantum information processing. Remarkably, it is\npossible to generate entanglement even in the absence of direct interactions:\nprovided that which path information is erased, weak spin-state dependent light\nscattering can be used to project two distant spins onto a maximally entangled\nstate upon detection of a single photon. Even though this approach is\nnecessarily probabilistic, successful generation of entanglement is heralded by\nthe photon detection event. Here, we demonstrate heralded quantum entanglement\nof two quantum dot heavy-hole spins separated by 5 meters using single-photon\ninterference. Thanks to the long coherence time of hole spins and the efficient\nspin-photon interface provided by self-assembled quantum dots embedded in leaky\nmicrocavity structures, we generate 2300 entangled spin pairs per second, which\nrepresents an improvement approaching three orders of magnitude as compared to\nprior experiments. Delayed two-photon interference scheme we developed allows\nfor efficient verification of quantum correlations. Our results lay the\ngroundwork for the realization of quantum networks in semiconductor\nnanostructures. Combined with schemes for transferring quantum information to a\nlong-lived memory qubit, fast entanglement generation we demonstrate could also\nimpact quantum repeater architectures.\n", "  We present an algorithm for deriving partonic flavour labels to be applied to\ntruth particle jets in Monte Carlo event simulations. The inputs to this\napproach are final pre-hadronization partons, to remove dependence on\nunphysical details such as the order of matrix element calculation and shower\ngenerator frame recoil treatment. These are clustered using standard jet\nalgorithms, modified to restrict the allowed pseudojet combinations to those in\nwhich tracked flavour labels are consistent with QCD and QED Feynman rules. The\nresulting algorithm is shown to be portable between the major families of\nshower generators, and largely insensitive to many possible systematic\nvariations: it hence offers significant advantages over existing ad hoc\nlabelling schemes. However, it is shown that contamination from multi-parton\nscattering simulations can disrupt the labelling results. Suggestions are made\nfor further extension to incorporate more detailed QCD splitting function\nkinematics, robustness improvements, and potential uses for truth-level physics\nobject definitions and tagging.\n", "  The possibility of spatially resolving the optical properties of atomically\nthin materials is especially appealing as they can be modulated at the micro-\nand nanoscale by reducing their thickness, changing the doping level or\napplying a mechanical deformation. Therefore, optical spectroscopy techniques\nwith high spatial resolution are necessary to get a deeper insight into the\nproperties of two-dimensional materials. Here we study the optical absorption\nof single- and few-layer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) in the spectral range from\n1.24 eV to 3.22 eV (385 nm to 1000 nm) by developing a hyperspectral imaging\ntechnique that allows one to probe the optical properties with diffraction\nlimited spatial resolution. We find hyperspectral imaging very suited to study\nindirect bandgap semiconductors, unlike photoluminescence that only provides\nhigh luminescence yield for direct gap semiconductors. Moreover, this work\nopens the door to study the spatial variation of the optical properties of\nother two-dimensional systems, including non-semiconducting materials where\nscanning photoluminescence cannot be employed.\n", "  We propose a novel theory of dark matter (DM) superfluidity that matches the\nsuccesses of the LambdaCDM model on cosmological scales while simultaneously\nreproducing the MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) phenomenology on galactic\nscales. The DM and MOND components have a common origin, representing different\nphases of a single underlying substance. DM consists of axion-like particles\nwith mass of order eV and strong self-interactions. The condensate has a\npolytropic equation of state P~rho^3 giving rise to a superfluid core within\ngalaxies. Instead of behaving as individual collisionless particles, the DM\nsuperfluid is more aptly described as collective excitations. Superfluid\nphonons, in particular, are assumed to be governed by a MOND-like effective\naction and mediate a MONDian acceleration between baryonic matter particles.\nOur framework naturally distinguishes between galaxies (where MOND is\nsuccessful) and galaxy clusters (where MOND is not): due to the higher velocity\ndispersion in clusters, and correspondingly higher temperature, the DM in\nclusters is either in a mixture of superfluid and normal phase, or fully in the\nnormal phase. The rich and well-studied physics of superfluidity leads to a\nnumber of observational signatures: array of low-density vortices in galaxies,\nmerger dynamics that depend on the infall velocity vs phonon sound speed;\ndistinct mass peaks in bullet-like cluster mergers, corresponding to superfluid\nand normal components; interference patters in super-critical mergers.\nRemarkably, the superfluid phonon effective theory is strikingly similar to\nthat of the unitary Fermi gas, which has attracted much excitement in the cold\natom community in recent years. The critical temperature for DM superfluidity\nis of order mK, comparable to known cold atom Bose-Einstein condensates.\n", "  A multimode optical fiber with a truncated transverse cross section acts as a\npowerful versatile support to investigate the wave features of complex ray\ndynamics. In this paper, we concentrate on the case of a geometry inducing a\nmixed dynamics. We highlight the properties of regular modes associated to\nstable periodic orbits such as an enhanced intensity localization and report\nunexpected attributes such as the statistics of the Inverse Participation Ratio\nthat present features analogous to those of Anderson localized modes. Our study\nis supported by both numerical and experimental results.\n", "  Chimera states---curious symmetry-broken states in systems of identical\ncoupled oscillators---typically occur only for certain initial conditions. Here\nwe analyze their basins of attraction in a simple system comprised of two\npopulations. Using perturbative analysis and numerical simulation we evaluate\nasymptotic states and associated destination maps, and demonstrate that basins\nform a complex twisting structure in phase space. Understanding the basins'\nprecise nature may help in the development of control methods to switch between\nchimera patterns, with possible technological and neural system applications.\n", "  By using the algebraic construction outlined in \\cite{CGRS}, we introduce\nseveral Markov processes related to the ${\\mathcal{U}}_q(\\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$\nquantum Lie algebra. These processes serve as asymmetric transport models and\ntheir algebraic structure easily allows to deduce duality properties of the\nsystems. The results include: (a) the asymmetric version of the Inclusion\nProcess, which is self-dual; (b) the diffusion limit of this process, which is\na natural asymmetric analogue of the Brownian Energy Process and which turns\nout to have the symmetric Inclusion Process as a dual process; (c) the\nasymmetric analogue of the KMP Process, which also turns out to have a\nsymmetric dual process. We give applications of the various duality relations\nby computing exponential moments of the current.\n", "  We introduce a family of Maxwellian Demons for which correlations among\ninformation bearing degrees of freedom can be calculated exactly and in compact\nanalytical form. This allows one to precisely determine Demon functional\nthermodynamic operating regimes, when previous methods either misclassify or\nsimply fail due to approximations they invoke. This reveals that these Demons\nare more functional than previous candidates. They too behave either as\nengines, lifting a mass against gravity by extracting energy from a single heat\nreservoir, or as Landauer erasers, consuming external work to remove\ninformation from a sequence of binary symbols by decreasing their individual\nuncertainty. Going beyond these, our Demon exhibits a new functionality that\nerases bits not by simply decreasing individual-symbol uncertainty, but by\nincreasing inter-bit correlations (that is, by adding temporal order) while\nincreasing single-symbol uncertainty. In all cases, but especially in the new\nerasure regime, exactly accounting for informational correlations leads to\ntight bounds on Demon performance, expressed as a refined Second Law of\nThermodynamics that relies on the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy for dynamical\nprocesses and not on changes purely in system configurational entropy, as\npreviously employed. We rigorously derive the refined Second Law under minimal\nassumptions and so it applies quite broadly---for Demons with and without\nmemory and input sequences that are correlated or not. We note that general\nMaxwellian Demons readily violate previously proposed, alternative such bounds,\nwhile the current bound still holds.\n", "  For some time the York time parameter has been identified as a candidate for\na physically meaningful time in cosmology. An associated Hamiltonian may be\nfound by solving the Hamiltonian constraint for the momentum conjugate to the\nYork time variable, although an explicit solution can only be found in highly\nsymmetric cases. The Poisson structure of the remaining variables is not\ncanonical. Here we quantise this dynamics in an anisotropic minisuperspace\nmodel via a natural extension of canonical quantisation. The resulting quantum\ntheory has no momentum representation. Instead the position basis takes a\nfundamental role. We illustrate how the quantum theory and the modified\nrepresentation of its momentum operators lead to a consistent theory in the\npresence of the constraints that arose during the Hamiltonian reduction. We are\nable to solve for the eigenspectrum of the Hamiltonian. Finally we discuss how\nfar the results of this model extend to the general non-homogeneous case, in\nparticular perturbation theory with York time.\n", "  The hole doped Fe-based superconductors Ba$_{1-x}$A$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ (where\nA=Na or K) show a particular rich phase diagram. It was observed that an\nintermediate re-entrant tetragonal phase forms within the orthorhombic\nantiferromagnetically-ordered stripe-type spin density wave state above the\nsuperconducting transition [S. Avci et al., Nature Comm. 5, 3845 (2014), A. E.\nB\\\"ohmer et al., arXiv:1412.7038v2]. A similar intermediate phase was reported\nto appear if pressure is applied to underdoped Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ [E.\nHassinger et al., Phys. Rev. B 86, 140502(R) (2012)]. Here we report data of\nthe electric resistivity, Hall effect, specific heat, and the thermoelectrical\nNernst and Seebeck coefficients measured on a Ba$_{0.85}$K$_{0.15}$Fe$_2$As$_2$\nsingle crystal under pressure up to 5.5 GPa. The data reveals a coexistence of\nthe intermediate phase with filamentary superconductivity. The Nernst\ncoefficient shows a large signature of nematic order that coincides with the\nstripe-type spin density wave state up to optimal pressure. In the\npressure-induced intermediate phase the nematic order is removed, thus\nconfirming that its nature is a re-entrant tetragonal phase.\n", "  Complete descriptions of the Lie symmetries of a class of nonlinear\nreaction-diffusion equations with gradient-dependent diffusivity in one and two\nspace dimensions are obtained. A surprisingly rich set of Lie symmetry algebras\ndepending on the form of diffusivity and source (sink) in the equations is\nderived. It is established that there exists a subclass in 1-D space admitting\nan infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of invariance so that it is linearisable. A\nspecial power-law diffusivity with a fixed exponent, which leads to wider Lie\ninvariance of the equations in question in 2-D space, is also derived. However,\nit is shown that the diffusion equation without a source term (which often\narises in applications and is sometimes called the Perona-Malik equation)\npossesses no rich variety of Lie symmetries depending on the form of\ngradient-dependent diffusivity. The results of the Lie symmetry classification\nfor the reduction to lower dimensionality, and a search for exact solutions of\nthe nonlinear 2-D equation with power-law diffusivity, also are included.\n", "  We study the effect of scalar leptoquarks on the exclusive rare $B$ meson\ndecays $\\bar{B}_d^0 \\rightarrow \\bar{K}^{* 0}\\left(\\rightarrow K^-\\pi^+\\right)\nl^+ l^-$ in the full kinematically accessible physical region. We work out the\nconstraints on leptoquark parameter space using the measured branching ratio of\n$B_s \\rightarrow \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ process by the CMS and LHCb collaborations. We\ncompute the branching ratio, forward-backward asymmetry and isospin asymmetry\ndistribution using the constrained parameter space. We also look into various\nform factor independent and CP violating observables in the scalar leptoquark\nmodel.\n", "  The a-function is a proposed quantity defined in even dimensions which has a\nmonotonic behaviour along RG flows, related to the beta-functions via a\ngradient flow equation. We study the a-function for a general scalar theory in\nsix dimensions, using the beta-functions up to three-loop order for both the\nMSbar and MOM schemes (the latter presented here for the first time at three\nloops).\n", "  Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) provides a practical means of extracting\ninsightful dynamical information from fluids datasets. Like any data processing\ntechnique, DMD's usefulness is limited by its ability to extract real and\naccurate dynamical features from noise-corrupted data. Here we show\nanalytically that DMD is biased to sensor noise, and quantify how this bias\ndepends on the size and noise level of the data. We present three modifications\nto DMD that can be used to remove this bias: (i) a direct correction of the\nidentified bias using known noise properties, (ii) combining the results of\nperforming DMD forwards and backwards in time, and (iii) a total\nleast-squares-inspired algorithm. We discuss the relative merits of each\nalgorithm, and demonstrate the performance of these modifications on a range of\nsynthetic, numerical, and experimental datasets. We further compare our\nmodified DMD algorithms with other variants proposed in recent literature.\n", "  We show that the full dynamical freedom of the well known Szekeres models\nallows for the description of elaborated 3--dimensional networks of cold dark\nmatter structures (over--densities and/or density voids) undergoing \"pancake\"\ncollapse. By reducing Einstein's field equations to a set of evolution\nequations, which themselves reduce in the linear limit to evolution equations\nfor linear perturbations, we determine the dynamics of such structures, with\nthe spatial comoving location of each structure uniquely specified by standard\nearly Universe initial conditions. By means of a representative example we\nexamine in detail the density contrast, the Hubble flow and peculiar velocities\nof structures that evolved, from linear initial data at the last scattering\nsurface, to fully non--linear 10--20 Mpc. scale configurations today. To\nmotivate further research, we provide a qualitative discussion on the\nconnection of Szekeres models with linear perturbations and the pancake\ncollapse of the Zeldovich approximation. This type of structure modelling\nprovides a coarse grained -- but fully relativistic non--linear and\nnon--perturbative -- description of evolving large scale cosmic structures\nbefore their virialisation, and as such it has an enormous potential for\napplications in cosmological research.\n", "  We study charged, static, topological black holes in pure Gauss-Bonnet\ngravity in asymptotically AdS space. As in general relativity, the theory\npossesses a unique nondegenerate AdS vacuum. It also admits charged black hole\nsolutions which asymptotically behave as the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m AdS black\nhole. We discuss black hole thermodynamics of these black holes. Then we study\nphase transitions in a dual quantum field theory in four dimensions, with the\nSt\\\"{u}ckelberg scalar field as an order parameter. We find in the probe limit\nthat the black hole can develop hair below some critical temperature, which\nsuggests a phase transition. Depending on the scalar coupling constants, the\nphase transition can be first or second order. Analysis of the free energy\nreveals that, comparing the two solutions, the hairy state is energetically\nfavorable, thus a phase transition will occur in a dual field theory.\n", "  The LHC discovery of a light Higgs particle $h^0$ (125GeV) opens up new\nprospect for searching heavier Higgs boson(s) at the LHC Run-2, which will\nunambiguously point to new physics beyond the standard model (SM). We study the\ndetection of a heavier neutral Higgs boson $H^0$ via di-Higgs production\nchannel at the LHC (14TeV), $H^0 \\to h^0h^0 \\to WW^*\\gamma\\gamma$. This\ndirectly probes the $Hhh$ cubic Higgs interaction, which exists in most\nextensions of the SM Higgs sector. For the decay products of final states\n$WW^*$, we include both pure leptonic mode $WW^* \\to\n\\ell\\bar{\\nu}\\bar{\\ell}\\nu$ and semi-leptonic mode $WW^* \\to q\\bar{q}'\\ell\\nu$.\nWe analyze signals and backgrounds by performing fast detector simulation for\nthe full processes $pp \\to H \\to hh \\to WW^*\\gamma\\gamma \\to\n\\ell\\bar{\\nu}\\bar{\\ell}\\nu\\gamma\\gamma$ and $pp \\to H \\to hh \\to\nWW^*\\gamma\\gamma \\to \\ell\\nu q\\bar{q}'\\gamma\\gamma$, over the mass range\n$M_H=250-600$GeV. For generic two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM), we present the\ndiscovery reach of the heavier Higgs boson at the LHC Run-2, and compare it\nwith the current Higgs global fit of the 2HDM parameter space.\n", "  Considerable evidence suggests that anticipating sudden shifts from one state\nto another in bistable dynamical systems is a challenging task, examples\ninclude ecosystems, financial markets, complex diseases, etc. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the effects of additive, multiplicative and cross correlated\nstochastic perturbations on determining regime shifts in a bistable gene\nregulatory sys- tem, which gives rise to two distinct states of low and high\nconcentrations of protein. We obtain the stationary probability density and\nmean first passage time of the system. We show that increasing\nadditive(multiplicative) noise intensity induces regime shift from a low(high)\nto a high(low) pro- tein concentration state. However, an increase in cross\ncorrelation intensity always induces regime shifts from high to low protein\nconcentration state. For both bifurcation (often called tipping point) and\nnoise induced (called stochastic switching) regime shifts, we further explore\nthe robustness of recently developed critical slowing down based early warning\nsignal (EWS) indicators (e.g., rising variance and lag-1 autocorrelation) on\nour simulated time series data. We identify that using EWS indicators,\nprediction of an impending bifurcation induced regime shift is relatively\neasier than that of a noise induced regime shift in the considered system.\nMoreover, the success of EWS indicators also strongly depends upon the nature\nof noise. Our results establish the key fact that finding more robust indicator\nto forewarn regime shifts for a broader class complex natural systems is still\nin its infancy and demands extensive research.\n", "  We introduce a new mechanism for generating magnetic fields in the\nrecombination era. This Harrison-like mechanism utilizes vorticity in baryons\nthat is sourced through the Bose-Einstein condensate of axions via\ngravitational interactions. The magnetic fields generated are on the galactic\nscales $\\sim 10\\,{\\rm kpc}$ and have a magnitude of the order of\n$B\\sim10^{-23}\\,{\\rm G}$ today. The field has a greater magnitude than those\ngenerated from other mechanisms relying on second order perturbation theory,\nand is sufficient to provide a seed for battery mechanisms.\n", "  We consider the isotropic spin$-\\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain with the most\ngeneral integrable boundaries. The scalar product between the on-shell Bethe\nvector and its off-shell dual, obtained by means of the modified algebraic\nBethe ansatz, is given by a modified Slavnov formula. The corresponding\nGaudin-Korepin formula, \\textit{i.e.}, the square of the norm, is also\nobtained.\n", "  Guaranteeing nonrepudiation, unforgeability as well as transferability of a\nsignature is one of the most vital safeguards in today's e-commerce era. Based\non fundamental laws of quantum physics, quantum digital signature (QDS) aims to\nprovide information-theoretic security for this cryptographic task. However, up\nto date, the previously proposed QDS protocols are impractical due to various\nchallenging problems and most importantly, the requirement of authenticated\n(secure) quantum channels between participants. Here, we present the first\nquantum digital signature protocol that removes the assumption of authenticated\nquantum channels while remaining secure against the collective attacks.\nBesides, our QDS protocol can be practically implemented over more than 100 km\nunder current mature technology as used in quantum key distribution.\n", "  We demonstrate a two-color entangled pho ton pair source which can be adapted\neasily to a wide range of wavelengths combinations. A Fresnel rhomb as a\ngeometrical quarter-wave plate and a versatile combination of compensation\ncrystals are key components of the source. Entanglement of two photons at the\nCs D1 line (894.3 nm) and at the telecom O-band (1313.1 nm) with a fidelity of\n$F = 0.753 \\pm 0.021$ is demonstrated and improvements of the setup are\ndiscussed.\n", "  The understanding of how the sub-nanoscale exchange interaction evolves in\nmacroscale correlations and ordered phases of matter, such as magnetism and\nsuperconductivity, requires to bridge the quantum and classical worlds. This\nmonumental challenge has so far only been achieved for systems close to their\nthermodynamical equilibrium. Here we follow in real time the ultrafast dynamics\nof the macroscale magnetic order parameter triggered by the impulsive optical\ngeneration of spin excitations with the shortest possible nanometer-wavelength\nand femtosecond-period. Our experiments also disclose a possibility for the\ncoherent control of these femtosecond nanomagnons, which are defined by the\nexchange energy. These findings open up novel opportunities for fundamental\nresearch on the role of short-wavelength spin excitations in magnetism and\nhigh-temperature superconductivity, since they provide a macroscopic probe of\nthe femtosecond dynamics of sub-nanometer spin-spin correlations and,\nultimately, of the exchange energy. With this approach it becomes possible to\ntrace the dynamics of such short-range magnetic correlations for instance\nduring phase transitions. Moreover, our work suggests that nanospintronics and\nnanomagnonics can employ phase-controllable spin waves with frequencies in the\n20 THz domain.\n", "  We present FaRe, a package for Mathematica that implements the decomposition\nof a generic tensor Feynman integral, with arbitrary loop number, into scalar\nintegrals in higher dimension. In order for FaRe to work, the package FeynCalc\nis needed, so that the tensor structure of the different contributions is\npreserved and the obtained scalar integrals are grouped accordingly. FaRe can\nprove particularly useful when it is preferable to handle Feynman integrals\nwith free Lorentz indices and tensor reduction of high-order integrals is\nneeded. This can then be achieved with several powerful existing tools.\n", "  In this article we study the classical nearest-neighbour spin-ice model\n(nnSI) by means of Monte Carlo simulations, using the Wang-Landau algorithm.\nThe nnSI describes several of the salient features of the spin-ice materials.\nDespite its simplicity it exhibits a remarkably rich behaviour. The model has\nbeen studied using a variety of techniques, thus it serves as an ideal\nbenchmark to test the capabilities of the Wang Landau algorithm in magnetically\nfrustrated systems. We study in detail the residual entropy of the nnSI and, by\nintroducing an applied magnetic field in two different crystallographic\ndirections ([111] and [100],) we explore the physics of the kagome-ice phase,\nthe transition to full polarisation, and the three dimensional Kasteleyn\ntransition. In the latter case, we discuss how additional constraints can be\nadded to the Hamiltonian, by taking into account a selective choice of states\nin the partition function and, then, show how this choice leads to the\nrealization of the ideal Kasteleyn transition in the system.\n", "  We study T-duality transformations in canonical formalism for Nambu-Gotto\naction. Then we investigate the relation between world-sheet double Wick\nrotation and sequence of target space T-dualities and Wick rotation in case of\nfundamental string and D1-brane.\n", "  We analyse the periodicity of persistent currents in quantum spin Hall loops,\npartly covered with an $s$-wave superconductor, in the presence of a flux tube.\nMuch like in normal (non-helical) metals, the periodicity of the\nsingle-particle spectrum goes from $\\Phi_0 = h/e$ to $\\Phi_0/2$ as the length\nof the superconductor is increased past the coherence length of the\nsuperconductor. We further analyze the periodicity of the persistent current,\nwhich is a many-body effect. Interestingly, time reversal symmetry and parity\nconservation can significantly change the period. We find a $2\\Phi_0$-periodic\npersistent current in two distinct regimes, where one corresponds to a\nJosephson junction and the other one to an Aharonov-Bohm setup.\n", "  This paper presents a method to generate valid high order meshes with\noptimized geometrical accuracy. The high order meshing procedure starts with a\nlinear mesh, that is subsequently curved without taking care of the validity of\nthe high order elements. An optimization procedure is then used to both\nuntangle invalid elements and optimize the geometrical accuracy of the mesh.\nStandard measures of the distance between curves are considered to evaluate the\ngeometrical accuracy in planar two-dimensional meshes, but they prove\ncomputationally too costly for optimization purposes. A fast estimate of the\ngeometrical accuracy, based on Taylor expansions of the curves, is introduced.\nAn unconstrained optimization procedure based on this estimate is shown to\nyield significant improvements in the geometrical accuracy of high order\nmeshes, as measured by the standard Haudorff distance between the geometrical\nmodel and the mesh. Several examples illustrate the beneficial impact of this\nmethod on CFD solutions, with a particular role of the enhanced mesh boundary\nsmoothness.\n", "  The ANTARES experiment consists of an array of photomultipliers distributed\nalong 12 lines and located deep underwater in the Mediterranean Sea. It\nsearches for astrophysical neutrinos collecting the Cherenkov light induced by\nthe charged particles, mainly muons, produced in neutrino interactions around\nthe detector. Since at energies of $\\sim$10 TeV the muon and the incident\nneutrino are almost collinear, it is possible to use the ANTARES detector as a\nneutrino telescope and identify a source of neutrinos in the sky starting from\na precise reconstruction of the muon trajectory. To get this result, the\narrival times of the Cherenkov photons must be accurately measured. A to\nperform time calibrations with the precision required to have optimal\nperformances of the instrument is described. The reconstructed tracks of the\natmospheric muons in the ANTARES detector are used to determine the relative\ntime offsets between photomultipliers. Currently, this method is used to obtain\nthe time calibration constants for photomultipliers on different lines at a\nprecision level of 0.5 ns. It has also been validated for calibrating\nphotomultipliers on the same line, using a system of LEDs and laser light\ndevices.\n", "  We analyze the spin dynamics of an out-of-equilibrium large spin dipolar\natomic Bose gas in an optical lattice. We observe a smooth crossover from a\ncomplex oscillatory behavior to an exponential behavior throughout the Mott to\nsuperfluid transition. While both of these regimes are well described by our\ntheoretical models, we provide data in the intermediate regime where dipolar\ninteractions, contact interactions, and super-exchange mechanisms compete. In\nthis strongly correlated regime, spin dynamics and transport are coupled, which\nchallenges theoretical models for quantum magnetism.\n", "  Semiconductor quantum dots in silicon are promising qubits because of long\nspin coherence times and their potential for scalability. However, such qubits\nwith complete electrical control and fidelities above the threshold for quantum\nerror correction have not yet been achieved. We show theoretically that the\nthreshold fidelity can be achieved with ac gate operation of the quantum dot\nhybrid qubit. Formed by three electrons in a double dot, this qubit is\nelectrically controlled, does not require magnetic fields, and runs at GHz gate\nspeeds. We analyze the decoherence caused by 1/f charge noise in this qubit,\nfind the parameter regime for tunnel couplings and detuning that minimize the\ncharge noise dependence in the qubit frequency, and determine the optimal\nworking points for ac gate operations that drive the detuning and tunnel\ncoupling.\n", "  In this paper we study the time evolution of (Renyi) entanglement entropies\nfor locally excited states in four dimensional free massless fermionic field\ntheory. Locally excited states are defined by being acted by various local\noperators on the ground state. Their excesses are defined by subtracting\n(Renyi) entanglement entropy for the ground state from those for locally\nexcited states. They finally approach some constant if the subsystem is given\nby half of the total space. They have spin dependence. They can be interpreted\nin terms of quasi-particles.\n", "  We revisit the construction of the tensionless limit of closed bosonic string\ntheory in the covariant formulation in the light of Galilean conformal symmetry\nthat rises as the residual gauge symmetry on the tensionless worldsheet. We\nrelate the analysis of the fundamentally tensionless theory to the tensionless\nlimit that is viewed as a contraction of worldsheet coordinates. Analysis of\nthe quantum regime uncovers interesting physics. The degrees of freedom that\nappear in the tensionless string are fundamentally different from the usual\nstring states. Through a Bogoliubov transformation on the worldsheet, we link\nthe tensionless vacuum to the usual tensile vacuum. As an application, we show\nthat our analysis can be used to understand physics of strings at very high\ntemperatures and propose that these new degrees of freedom are naturally\nconnected with the long-string picture of the Hagedorn phase of free string\ntheory. We also show that tensionless closed strings behave like open strings.\n", "  In pure gravity mediation (PGM), the most minimal scheme for the mediation of\nsupersymmetry (SUSY) breaking to the visible sector, soft masses for the\nstandard model gauginos are generated at one loop rather than via direct\ncouplings to the SUSY-breaking field. In any concrete implementation of PGM,\nthe SUSY-breaking field is therefore required to carry nonzero charge under\nsome global or local symmetry. As we point out in this note, a prime candidate\nfor such a symmetry might be B-L, the Abelian gauge symmetry associated with\nthe difference between baryon number B and lepton number L. The F-term of the\nSUSY-breaking field then not only breaks SUSY, but also B-L, which relates the\nrespective spontaneous breaking of SUSY and B-L at a fundamental level. As a\nparticularly interesting consequence, we find that the heavy Majorana neutrino\nmass scale ends up being tied to the gravitino mass, Lambda_N ~ m_3/2. Assuming\nnonthermal leptogenesis to be responsible for the generation of the baryon\nasymmetry of the universe, this connection may then explain why SUSY\nnecessarily needs to be broken at a rather high energy scale, so that m_3/2 >~\n1000 TeV in accord with the concept of PGM. We illustrate our idea by means of\na minimal model of dynamical SUSY breaking, in which B-L is identified as a\nweakly gauged flavor symmetry. We also discuss the effect of the B-L gauge\ndynamics on the superparticle mass spectrum as well as the resulting\nconstraints on the parameter space of our model. In particular, we comment on\nthe role of the B-L D-term.\n", "  We present the extension of two general algorithms for the treatment of\ninfrared singularities arising in electroweak corrections to decay processes at\nnext-to-leading order: the dipole subtraction formalism and the one-cutoff\nslicing method. The former is extended to the case of decay kinematics which\nhas not been considered in the literature so far. The latter is generalized to\nproduction and decay processes with more than two charged particles, where new\n\"surface\" terms arise. Arbitrary patterns of massive and massless external\nparticles are considered, including the treatment of infrared singularities in\ndimensional or mass regularization. As an application of the two techniques we\npresent the calculation of the next-to-leading-order QCD and electroweak\ncorrections to the top-quark decay width including all off-shell and decay\neffects of intermediate W bosons. The result, e.g., represents a building block\nof a future calculation of NLO electroweak effects to off-shell top-quark pair\n(WWbb) production. Moreover, this calculation can serve as the first step\ntowards an event generator for top-quark decays at next-to-leading order\naccuracy, which can be used to attach top-quark decays to complicated\nmany-particle top-quark processes, such as for tt+H or tt+jets.\n", "  A fundamental mystery in earthquake physics is ``how can an earthquake be\ntriggered by distant seismic sources?'' Here, we use discrete element method\nsimulations of a granular layer, during stick-slip, that is subject to\ntransient vibrational excitation to gain further insight into the physics of\ndynamic earthquake triggering. Using Coulomb friction law for grains\ninteraction, we observe delayed triggering of slip in the granular gouge. We\nfind that at a critical vibrational amplitude (strain) there is an abrupt\ntransition from negligible time-advanced slip (clock advance) to full clock\nadvance, {\\it i.e.}, transient vibration and triggered slip are simultaneous.\nThe critical strain is order of $10^{-6}$, similar to observations in the\nlaboratory and in Earth. The transition is related to frictional weakening of\nthe granular layer due to a dramatic decrease in coordination number and the\nweakening of the contact force network. Associated with this frictional\nweakening is a pronounced decrease in the elastic modulus of the layer. The\nstudy has important implications for mechanisms of triggered earthquakes and\ninduced seismic events and points out the underlying processes in response of\nthe fault gouge to dynamic transient stresses.\n", "  Although enhanced conductivity at ferroelectric domain boundaries has been\nfound in BiFeO$_3$ films, Pb(Zr,Ti)O$_3$ films, and hexagonal rare-earth\nmanganite single crystals, the mechanism of the domain wall conductivity is\nstill under debate. Using conductive atomic force microscopy, we observe\nenhanced conductance at the electrically-neutral domain walls in semiconducting\nhexagonal ferroelectric TbMnO$_3$ thin films where the structure and\npolarization direction are strongly constrained along the c-axis. This result\nindicates that domain wall conductivity in ferroelectric rare-earth manganites\nis not limited to charged domain walls. We show that the observed conductivity\nin the TbMnO$_3$ films is governed by a single conduction mechanism, namely,\nthe back-to-back Schottky diodes model tuned by the segregation of defects.\n", "  The problem of the determination of the nuclear surface and surface symmetry\nenergy is addressed in the framework of the Extended Thomas Fermi (ETF)\napproximation using Skyrme functionals. We propose an analytical model for the\ndensity profiles with variationally determined diffuseness parameters. For the\ncase of symmetric nuclei, the resulting ETF functional can be exactly\nintegrated, leading to an analytical formula expressing the surface energy as a\nfunction of the couplings of the energy functional. The importance of non-local\nterms is stressed, which cannot be simply deduced from the local part of the\nfunctional. In the case of asymmetric nuclei, we propose an approximate\nexpression for the diffuseness and the surface energy. These quantities are\nanalytically related to the parameters of the energy functional. In particular,\nthe influence of the different equation of state parameters can be explicitly\nquantified. Detailed analyses of the different energy components\n(local/non-local, isoscalar/isovector, surface/curvature and higher order) are\nalso performed. Our analytical solution of the ETF integral improves over\nprevious models and leads to a precision better than 200 keV per nucleon in the\ndetermination of the nuclear binding energy for dripline nuclei.\n", "  We study how the thermodynamic properties of the Triangular Plaquette Model\n(TPM) are influenced by the addition of extra interactions. The thermodynamics\nof the original TPM is trivial, while its dynamics is glassy, as usual in\nKinetically Constrained Models. As soon as we generalize the model to include\nadditional interactions, a thermodynamic phase transition appears in the\nsystem. The additional interactions we consider are either short ranged,\nforming a regular lattice in the plane, or long ranged of the small-world kind.\nIn the case of long-range interactions we call the new model Random-Diluted\nTPM. We provide arguments that the model so modified should undergo a\nthermodynamic phase transition, and that in the long-range case this is a glass\ntransition of the \"Random First-Order\" kind. Finally, we give support to our\nconjectures studying the finite temperature phase diagram of the Random-Diluted\nTPM in the Bethe approximation. This corresponds to the exact calculation on\nthe random regular graph, where free-energy and configurational entropy can be\ncomputed by means of the cavity equations.\n", "  Defects in silicon carbide are of intense and increasing interest for\nquantum-based applications due to this material's properties and technological\nmaturity. We calculate the multi-particle symmetry adapted wave functions of\nthe negatively charged silicon vacancy defect in hexagonal silicon carbide via\nuse of group theory and density functional theory and find the effects of\nspin-orbit and spin-spin interactions on these states. Although we focused on\n$\\textrm{V}_{\\textrm{Si}}^-$ in 4H-SiC, because of its unique fine structure\ndue to odd number of active electrons, our methods can be easily applied to\nother defect centers of different polytpes, especially to the 6H-SiC. Based on\nthese results we identify the mechanism that polarizes the spin under optical\ndrive, obtain the ordering of its dark doublet states, point out a path for\nelectric field or strain sensing, and find the theoretical value of its\nground-state zero field splitting to be 68 MHz, in good agreement with\nexperiment. Moreover, we present two distinct protocols of a spin-photon\ninterface based on this defect. Our results pave the way toward novel quantum\ninformation and quantum metrology applications with silicon carbide.\n", "  Here, we report wafer scale fabrication of densely packed Fe nanostripe-based\nmagnetic thin films on a flexible substrate and their magnetic anisotropy\nproperties. We find that Fe nanostripes exhibit large in-plane uniaxial\nanisotropy and nearly square hysteresis loops with energy products (BH)max\nexceeding 3 MGOe at room temperature. High density Fe nanostripes were\nfabricated on 70 nm flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) gratings, which\nwere made by roll-to-roll (R2R) UV nanoimprintlithography technique. Observed\nlarge in-plane uniaxial anisotropies along the long dimension of nanostripes\nare attributed to the shape. Temperature dependent hysteresis measurements\nconfirm that the magnetization reversal is driven by non-coherent rotation\nreversal processes.\n", "  We report excited state emission from p-states at excitation fluences well\nbelow ground state saturation in CdSe nanoplatelets. Size dependent exciton\nground state-excited state energies and dynamics are determined by three\nindependent methods, time-resolved photoluminescence (PL), time-integrated PL\nand Hartree renormalized k$\\cdot$p calculations -- all in very good agreement.\nThe ground state-excited state energy spacing strongly increases with the\nlateral platelet quantization. Our results suggest that the PL decay of CdSe\nplatelets is governed by an LO-phonon bottleneck, related to the reported low\nexciton phonon coupling in CdSe platelets and only observable due to the very\nlarge oscillator strength and energy spacing of both states.\n", "  We demonstrate the tip induced control of the spin state of copper\nphthalocyanine (CuPc) on an insulator coated substrate. Accounting for\nelectronic correlations, we find that, under the condition of energetic\nproximity of neutral excited states to the anionic groundstate, the system can\nundergo a population inversion towards these excited states. The resulting\nstate of the system is accompanied by a change in the total spin quantum\nnumber. Experimental signatures of the crossover are the appearance of\nadditional nodal planes in the topographical STM images as well as a strong\nsuppression of the current near the center of the molecule. The robustness of\nthe effect against moderate charge conserving relaxation processes has also\nbeen tested.\n", "  The modified gravity is considered to be one of possible explanations of the\naccelerated expansions of the present and the early universe. We study effects\nof the modified gravity on big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). If effects of the\nmodified gravity are significant during the BBN epoch, they should be observed\nas changes of primordial light element abundances. We assume a $f(G)$ term with\nthe Gauss-Bonnet term $G$, during the BBN epoch. A power-law relation of $df/dG\n\\propto t^p$ where $t$ is the cosmic time was assumed for the function $f(G)$\nas an example case. We solve time evolutions of physical variables during BBN\nin the $f(G)$ gravity model numerically, and analyzed calculated results. It is\nfound that a proper solution for the cosmic expansion rate can be lost in some\nparameter region. In addition, we show that calculated results of primordial\nlight element abundances can be significantly different from observational\ndata. Especially, observational limits on primordial D abundance leads to the\nstrongest constraint on the $f(G)$ gravity. We then derive constraints on\nparameters of the $f(G)$ gravity taking into account the existence of the\nsolution of expansion rate and final light element abundances.\n", "  We calculate holographically arbitrary n-point correlators of the boundary\nstress tensor in three-dimensional Einstein gravity with negative or vanishing\ncosmological constant. We provide explicit expressions up to 5-point\n(connected) correlators and show consistency with the Galilean conformal field\ntheory Ward identities and recursion relations of correlators, which we derive.\nThis provides a novel check of flat space holography in three dimensions.\n", "  In the reduction of 4d dualities to 3d there are non-perturbative effects\narising from monopoles acting as instantons. This mechanism has been reproduced\nin string theory by engineering the theories in a IIA brane setup. Nevertheless\nthere are limiting cases of the 4d dualities where the dual theories are\nactually confined phases of the UV gauge theories. In these cases the monopoles\nare absent and the mechanism of reduction of the 4d duality has to be modified.\nIn this paper we investigate such modification in the brane setup. The main\nobservation behind our analysis is that in the 4d case the superpotential of\nthe confined theories can been obtained also as the \"exotic\" contribution of a\nD0 brane, a stringy instanton. When considering these configurations we\nreproduce the field theory results in the brane setup. We study both the\nunitary and the symplectic case. As a further check we study the reduction of\nthe 4d superconformal index to the 3d partition function for these theories.\n", "  The charged vector $\\rho$ mesons in the presence of external magnetic fields\nat finite temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\\mu$ have been investigated\nin the framework of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. We compute the masses of\ncharged $\\rho$ mesons numerically as a function of the magnetic field for\ndifferent values of temperature and chemical potential. The self-energy of the\n$\\rho$ meson contains the quark-loop contribution, i.e. the leading order\ncontribution in $1/N_c$ expansion. The charged $\\rho$ meson mass decreases with\nthe magnetic field and drops to zero at a critical magnetic field $eB_c$, which\nmeans that the charged vector meson condensation, i.e. the electromagnetic\nsuperconductor can be induced above the critical magnetic field. Surprisingly,\nit is found that the charged $\\rho$ condensation can even survive at high\ntemperature and density. At zero temperature, the critical magnetic field just\nincreases slightly with the chemical potential, which indicates that the\ncharged $\\rho$ condensation might occur inside compact stars. At zero density,\nin the temperature range $0.2-0.5~ {\\rm GeV}$, the critical magnetic field for\ncharged $\\rho$ condensation is in the range of $0.2-0.6~ {\\rm GeV}^2$, which\nindicates that the high temperature electromagnetic superconductor could be\ncreated at LHC.\n", "  Nowadays the number of models aimed at explaining the Type Ia supernova\nphenomenon is high and discriminating between them is a must-do. In this work\nwe explore the influence of rotation in the evolution of the nuclear flame\nwhich drives the explosion in the so called gravitational confined detonation\nmodels. Assuming that the flame starts in a point-like region slightly above\nthe center of the white dwarf (WD) and adding a moderate amount of angular\nvelocity to the star we follow the evolution of the deflagration using a\nsmoothed particle hydrodynamics code. We find that the results are very\ndependent on the angle between the rotational axis and the line connecting the\ninitial bubble of burned material with the center of the white dwarf at the\nmoment of the ignition. The impact of rotation is larger for angles close to\n90{\\deg} because the Coriolis force on a floating element of fluid is maximum,\nand its principal effect is to break the symmetry of the deflagration. Such\nsymmetry breaking weakens the convergence of the nuclear flame at the antipodes\nof the initial ignition volume, changing the environmental conditions around\nthe convergence region with respect to non-rotating models. These changes seem\nto disfavor the emergence of a detonation in the compressed volume at the\nantipodes, thus compromising the viability of the so called gravitational\nconfined detonation mechanism.\n", "  The experimental achievements and the results obtained so far with the\nLPCTrap device installed at GANIL are presented. The apparatus is dedicated to\nthe study of the weak interaction at low energy by means of precise\nmeasurements of the BETA-NU angular correlation parameter in nuclear BETA\ndecays. So far, the data collected with three isotopes have enabled to\ndetermine, for the first time, the charge state distributions of the recoiling\nions, induced by shakeoff process. The analysis is presently refined to deduce\nthe correlation parameters, with the potential of improving both the constraint\ndeduced at low energy on exotic tensor currents (6He1+) and the precision on\nthe V u d element of the quark-mixing matrix (35Ar1+ and 19Ne1+) deduced from\nthe mirror transitions dataset.\n", "  Any solution to the Yang-Baxter equation yields a family of representations\nof braid groups. Under certain conditions, identified by Turaev, the\nappropriately normalized trace of these representations yields a link\ninvariant. Any Yang-Baxter solution can be interpreted as a two-qudit quantum\ngate. Here we show that if this gate is non-entangling, then the resulting\ninvariant of knots is trivial. We thus obtain a general connection between\ntopological entanglement and quantum entanglement, as suggested by Kauffman et\nal.\n", "  We investigated the depth dependence of coherence times of nitrogen-vacancy\n(NV) centers through precisely depth controlling by a moderately oxidative at\n580{\\deg}C in air. By successive nanoscale etching, NV centers could be brought\nclose to the diamond surface step by step, which enable us to trace the\nevolution of the number of NV centers remained in the chip and to study the\ndepth dependence of coherence times of NV centers with the diamond etching. Our\nresults showed that the coherence times of NV centers declined rapidly with the\ndepth reduction in their last about 22 nm before they finally disappeared,\nrevealing a critical depth for the influence of rapid fluctuating surface spin\nbath. By monitoring the coherence time variation with depth, we could make a\nshallow NV center with long coherence time for detecting external spins with\nhigh sensitivity.\n", "  We find simple expressions for the kinematic numerators of one-loop MHV\namplitudes in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and supergravity, for\nany multiplicity. The gauge theory numerators satisfy the\nBern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) duality between color and kinematics, so that the\ngravity numerators are simply the square of the gauge theory ones. The duality\nholds because the numerators can be written in terms of structure constants of\na kinematic algebra, which is familiar from the BCJ organization of self-dual\ngauge theory and gravity. The close connection that we find between one-loop\namplitudes in the self-dual case and in the maximally supersymmetric case is\nthe converse to the dimension-shifting formula. The starting point for arriving\nat our expressions is the dimensional reduction of ten-dimensional amplitudes\nobtained in the field-theory limit of open superstrings.\n", "  We prove space-time decay estimates of suitable weak solutions to the\nNavier-Stokes Cauchy problem, corresponding to a given asymptotic behavior of\nthe initial data of the same order of decay. We use two main tools. The first\nis a result obtained by the authors in the paper \"A remark on the partial\nregularity of a suitable weak solution to the Navier-Stokes Cauchy problem\"\n(submitted), on the behavior of the solution in a neighborhood of $t=0$ in the\n$L^\\infty_{loc}$-norm, which enables us to furnish a representation formula for\na suitable weak solution. The second is the asymptotic behavior of the\n$L^2(\\R^3\\setminus B_R)$ norm of $u(t)$ for $R\\to\\infty$. Following a Leray's\npoint of view, roughly speaking our result proves that a possible space-time\nturbulence does not perturb the asymptotic spatial behavior of the initial data\nof a suitable weak solution.\n", "  We sense the motion of a trapped atomic ion using a sequence of\nstate-dependent ultrafast momentum kicks. We use this atom interferometer to\ncharacterize a nearly-pure quantum state with $n=1$ phonon and accurately\nmeasure thermal states ranging from near the zero-point energy to $\\bar{n}\\sim\n10^4$, with the possibility of extending at least 100 times higher in energy.\nThe complete energy range of this method spans from the ground state to far\noutside of the Lamb-Dicke regime, where atomic motion is greater than the\noptical wavelength. Apart from thermometry, these interferometric techniques\nare useful for characterizing ultrafast entangling gates between multiple\ntrapped ions.\n", "  We report pulsed electron-spin resonance (ESR) measurements on an ensemble of\nBismuth donors in Silicon cooled at 10mK in a dilution refrigerator. Using a\nJosephson parametric microwave amplifier combined with high-quality factor\nsuperconducting micro-resonators cooled at millikelvin temperatures, we improve\nthe state-of-the-art sensitivity of inductive ESR detection by nearly 4 orders\nof magnitude. We demonstrate the detection of 1700 bismuth donor spins in\nsilicon within a single Hahn echo with unit signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio,\nreduced to just 150 spins by averaging a single Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill\nsequence. This unprecedented sensitivity reaches the limit set by quantum\nfluctuations of the electromagnetic field instead of thermal or technical\nnoise, which constitutes a novel regime for magnetic resonance.\n", "  We investigate strongly correlated spin-1 ultracold bosons with\nantiferromagnetic interactions in a cubic optical lattice, based on bosonic\ndynamical mean-field theory. Rich phase diagrams of the system are mapped out\nat both zero and finite temperature, and in particular the existence of a\nspin-singlet condensate is established. Interestingly, at finite temperature,\nwe find that the superfluid can be heated into a Mott insulator with even (odd)\nfilling via a first- (second-) order phase transition, analogous to the\nPomeranchuk effect in $^{3}$He. Moreover, for typical experimental setups, we\nestimate the critical temperatures for different ordered phases and our results\nsuggest that direct experimental observation of these phases is promising.\n", "  We report on a potentially deleterious issue regarding the four-wave mixing\nbased processing of dispersion-altered signals. We estimate the\nbaudrate-dependent pump linewidth tolerances by calculating the extra optical\nsignal to noise ratio (OSNR) penalty with respect to the propagation distance.\nWe find that the issue is not important for 10 Gbaud differential quadrature\nphase shift keying (DQPSK) signals, though for 28 Gbaud (and 56 Gbaud) DQPSK\nsignals we find that the pump linewidth requirements to implement FWM based\noptical signal processing needs to be in the sub-MHz range in order to avoid\nexcessive OSNR penalties for the case of dispersion-altered signals. These\nresults are pertinent for systems employing FWM, which could be all-optical\nwavelength converters for packet switching or mid-span spectral inversion\ntechniques.\n", "  There is no generally accepted view of the structure of the light-quark\nnon-strange scalar mesons. A variety of models have been proposed that\nencompass $qq\\bar{q}\\bar{q}$, molecular, $q\\bar{q}$ and glueball states in\nvarious combinations. Previously we considered scalar-meson photoproduction in\na simple Regge-pole model and showed that it was experimentally viable. Recent\ndata on the photoproduction of $a_0(980)$ and $f_0(980)$ confirm this. We\nextend our model to incorporate Regge cuts, based on our knowledge of $\\pi^0$\nphotoproduction. The theoretical predictions are compared to the $a_0(980)$ and\n$f_0(980)$ photoproduction data.\n", "  A two-dimensional dense fluid of frictional grains is shown to exhibit\ntime-chaotic, spatially heterogeneous flow in a range of stress values,\n$\\sigma$, chosen in the unstable region of s-shaped flow curves. Stress\ncontrolled simulations reveal a phase diagram with reentrant stationary flow\nfor small and large stress $\\sigma$. In between no steady flow state can be\nreached, instead the system either jams or displays time dependent\nheterogeneous strain rates $\\dot\\gamma({\\bf r},t)$. The results of simulations\nare in agreement with the stability analysis of a simple hydrodynamic model,\ncoupling stress and microstructure which we tentatively associate with the\nfrictional contact network.\n", "  The effect of an external pressure disturbance, being displaced with a\nconstant speed along the free surface of a viscous thin film, is studied\ntheoretically in the lubrication approximation in one- and two-dimensional\ngeometries. In the comoving frame, the imposed pressure field creates a\nstationary deformation of the interface - a wake - that spatially vanishes in\nthe far region. The shape of the wake and the way it vanishes depend on both\nthe speed and size of the external source and the properties of the film. The\nwave resistance, namely the force that has to be externally furnished in order\nto maintain the wake, is analysed in details. For finite-size pressure\ndisturbances, it increases with the speed, up to a certain transition value\nabove which a monotonic decrease occurs. The role of the horizontal extent of\nthe pressure field is studied as well, revealing that for a smaller disturbance\nthe latter transition occurs at higher speed. Eventually, for a Dirac pressure\nsource, the wave resistance either saturates in a 1D geometry, or diverges in a\n2D geometry.\n", "  Nonclassicality is a key ingredient for quantum enhanced technologies and\nexperiments involving macro- scopic quantum coherence. Considering various\nexactly-solvable quantum-oscillator systems, we address the role played by the\nanharmonicity of their potential in the establishment of nonclassical features.\nSpecifically, we show that a monotonic relation exists between the the entropic\nnonlinearity of the considered potentials and their ground state\nnonclassicality, as quantified by the negativity of the Wigner function. In\naddition, in order to clarify the role of squeezing--which is not captured by\nthe negativity of the Wigner function--we focus on the Glauber-Sudarshan\nP-function and address the nonclassicality/nonlinearity relation using the\nentanglement potential. Finally, we consider the case of a generic sixth-order\npotential confirming the idea that nonlinearity is a resource for the\ngeneration of nonclassicality and may serve as a guideline for the engineering\nof quantum oscillators.\n", "  Diffractive dissociation processes are analysed in the framework of covariant\nreggeization. We have considered the general form of hadronic tensor and its\nasymptotic behaviour for $t\\rightarrow 0$ in the case of conserved tensor\ncurrents before reggeization. Resulting expressions for differential\ncross-section of single dissociation (SD) process ($pp \\rightarrow p M$),\ndouble dissociation (DD) ($pp\\rightarrow M_1 M_2$) and for the proton-Pomeron\ncross-section are given in detail, and corresponding problems of the approach\nare discussed.\n", "  Systems with topologically protected ground-state degeneracies are currently\nof great interest due to their potential applications in quantum computing. In\npractise this degeneracy is never exact, and the magnitude of the ground-state\ndegeneracy splitting imposes constraints on the timescales over which\ninformation is topologically protected. In this Letter we use an instanton\napproach to evaluate the splitting of topological ground-state degeneracy in\nquasi-1D systems with parafermion zero modes, in the specific case where\nparafermions are realized by inducing a superconducting gap in pairs of\nfractional quantum Hall edges. We show that, like 1D topological\nsuperconducting wires, this splitting has an oscillatory dependence on the\nchemical potential, which arises from an intrinsic Berry phase that produces\ninterference between distinct instanton tunneling events. These Berry phases\ncan be mapped to chiral phases in a (dual) quantum clock model using a\nFradkin-Kadanoff transformation. Comparing our low-energy spectrum to that of\nphenomenological parafermion models allows us to evaluate the real and\nimaginary parts of the hopping integral between adjacent parafermionic zero\nmodes as a function of the chemical potential.\n", "  Using the Low Dispersion Survey Spectrograph 3 at the Magellan II Clay\nTelescope, we target {candidate absorption host galaxies} detected in deep\noptical imaging {(reaching limiting apparent magnitudes of 23.0-26.5 in $g, r,\ni,$ and $z$ filters) in the fields of three QSOs, each of which shows the\npresence of high metallicity, high $N_{\\rm HI}$ absorption systems in their\nspectra (Q0826-2230: $z_{abs}$=0.9110, Q1323-0021: $z_{abs}=0.7160$,\nQ1436-0051: $z_{abs}=0.7377, 0.9281$). We confirm three host galaxies {at\nredshifts 0.7387, 0.7401, and 0.9286} for two of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ absorption\nsystems (one with two galaxies interacting). For these systems, we are able to\ndetermine the star formation rates (SFRs); impact parameters (from previous\nimaging detections); the velocity shift between the absorption and emission\nredshifts; and, for one system, also the emission metallicity.} Based on\nprevious photometry, we find these galaxies have L$>$L$^{\\ast}$. The [O II]\nSFRs for these galaxies are in the range $11-25$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$\n{(uncorrected for dust)}, while the impact parameters lie in the range $35-54$\nkpc. {Despite the fact that we have confirmed galaxies at 50 kpc from the QSO,\nno gradient in metallicity is indicated between the absorption metallicity\nalong the QSO line of sight and the emission line metallicity in the galaxies.}\nWe confirm the anti-correlation between impact parameter and $N_{\\rm HI}$ from\nthe literature. We also report the emission redshift of five other galaxies:\nthree at $z_{em}>z_{QSO}$, and two (L$<$L$^{\\ast}$) at $z_{em}<z_{QSO}$ not\ncorresponding to any known absorption systems.\n", "  We present an exact rewriting of the Mie coefficients describing the\nscattering of light by a spherical core-shell particle which enables their\ninterpretation in terms of an hybridization of the two surface modes arising,\nrespectively, at the core-shell and the shell-medium interface. For this\nparticular case we thus obtain from the Mie theory--analytically for all\nmultipole orders and hence for arbitrarily sized particles--the hybridization\nscenario, which so far has been employed primarily for small particles in the\nelectrostatic approximation. To demonstrate the strength of the rewriting\napproach we also extract the hybridization scenario for a stratified sphere\ndirectly from the expansion coefficients for the electromagnetic fields.\n", "  A possible mechanism for the formation of a 90{\\deg} misfit dislocation at\nthe Ge/Si(001) interface through homogeneous nucleation is identified from\natomic scale calculations where a minimum energy path connecting the coherent\nepitaxial state and a final state with a 90{\\deg} misfit dislocation is found\nusing the nudged elastic band method. The initial path is generated using a\nrepulsive bias activation procedure in a model system including 75000 atoms.\nThe energy along the path exhibits two maxima in the energy. The first maximum\noccurs as a 60{\\deg} dislocation nucleates. The intermediate minimum\ncorresponds to an extended 60{\\deg} dislocation. The subsequent energy maximum\noccurs as a second 60{\\deg} dislocation nucleates in a complementary, mirror\nglide plane, simultaneously starting from the surface and from the first\n60{\\deg} dislocation. The activation energy of the nucleation of the second\ndislocation is 30% lower than that of the first one showing that the formation\nof the second 60{\\deg} dislocation is aided by the presence of the first one.\nThe simulations represent a step towards unraveling the formation mechanism of\n90{\\deg} dislocations, an important issue in the design of growth procedures\nfor strain released Ge overlayers on Si(100) surfaces, and more generally\nillustrate an approach that can be used to gain insight into the mechanism of\ncomplex nucleation paths of extended defects in solids.\n", "  Four rigid panels connected by hinges that meet at a point form a 4-vertex,\nthe fundamental building block of origami metamaterials. Here we show how the\ngeometry of 4-vertices, given by the sector angles of each plate, affects their\nfolding behavior. For generic vertices, we distinguish three vertex types and\ntwo subtypes. We establish relationships based on the relative sizes of the\nsector angles to determine which folds can fully close and the possible\nmountain-valley assignments. Next, we consider what occurs when sector angles\nor sums thereof are set equal, which results in 16 special vertex types. One of\nthese, flat-foldable vertices, has been studied extensively, but we show that a\nwide variety of qualitatively different folding motions exist for the other 15\nspecial and 3 generic types. Our work establishes a straightforward set of\nrules for understanding the folding motion of both generic and special\n4-vertices and serves as a roadmap for designing origami metamaterials.\n", "  We present a Vlasov, i.e. a kinetic Eulerian simulation study of nonlinear\ncollisionless ion-acoustic shocks and solitons excited by an intense laser\ninteracting with an overdense plasma. The use of the Vlasov code avoids\nproblems with low particle statistics and allows a validation of\nparticle-in-cell results. A simple original correction to the splitting method\nfor the numerical integration of the Vlasov equation has been implemented in\norder to ensure the charge conservation in the relativistic regime. We show\nthat the ion distribution is affected by the development of a turbulence driven\nby the relativistic \"fast\" electron bunches generated at the laser-plasma\ninteraction surface. This leads to the onset of ion reflection at the shock\nfront in an initially cold plasma where only soliton solutions without ion\nreflection are expected to propagate. We give a simple analytic model to\ndescribe the onset of the turbulence as a nonlinear coupling of the ion density\nwith the fast electron currents, taking the pulsed nature of the relativistic\nelectron bunches into account.\n", "  Two-dimensional (2D) materials are not expected to be metals at low\ntemperature due to electron localization. Consistent with this, pioneering\nstudies on thin films reported only superconducting and insulating ground\nstates, with a direct transition between the two as a function of disorder or\nmagnetic field. However, more recent works have revealed the presence of an\nintermediate metallic state occupying a substantial region of the phase diagram\nwhose nature is intensely debated. Here, we observe such a state in the\ndisorder-free limit of a crystalline 2D superconductor, produced by mechanical\nco-lamination of NbSe$_2$ in inert atmosphere. Under a small perpendicular\nmagnetic field, we induce a transition from superconductor to the intermediate\nmetallic state. We find a new power law scaling with field in this phase, which\nis consistent with the Bose metal model where metallic behavior arises from\nstrong phase fluctuations caused by the magnetic field.\n", "  Recently, a novel mechanism to address the hierarchy problem has been\nproposed \\cite{Graham:2015cka}, where the hierarchy between weak scale physics\nand any putative `cutoff' $M$ is translated into a parametrically large field\nexcursion for the so-called relaxion field, driving the Higgs mass to values\nmuch less than $M$ through cosmological dynamics. In its simplest incarnation,\nthe relaxion mechanism requires nothing beyond the standard model other than an\naxion (the relaxion field) and an inflaton. In this note, we critically\nre-examine the requirements for successfully realizing the relaxion mechanism\nand point out that parametrically larger field excursions can be obtained for a\ngiven number of e-folds by simply requiring that the background break exact de\nSitter invariance. We discuss several corollaries of this observation,\nincluding the interplay between the upper bound on the scale $M$ and the order\nparameter $\\epsilon$ associated with the breaking of dS symmetry, and entertain\nthe possibility that the relaxion could play the role of a curvaton. We find\nthat a successful realization of the mechanism is possible with as few as\n$\\mathcal O (10^3)$ e-foldings, albeit with a reduced cutoff $M \\sim 10^6$ GeV\nfor a dark QCD axion and outline a minimal scenario that can be made consistent\nwith CMB observations.\n", "  We explore two parabolic quantum well (PQW) samples, with and without Bragg\nmirrors, in order to optimise the building blocks of a Bosonic Cascade Laser.\nThe photoluminescence spectra of a PQW microcavity sample is compared against\nthat of a conventional microcavity with embedded quantum wells (QWs) to\ndemonstrate that the weak coupling lasing in a PQW sample can be achieved. The\nrelaxation dynamics in a conventional QW microcavity and in the PQW microcavity\nwas studied by a non-resonant pump-pump excitation method. Strong difference in\nthe relaxation characteristics between the two samples was found. The\nsemi-classical Boltzmann equations were adapted to reproduce the evolution of\nexcitonic populations within the PQW as a function of the pump power and the\noutput intensity evolution as a function of the pump-pump pulse delay. Fitting\nthe PQW data confirms the anticipated cascade relaxation, paving the way for\nsuch a system to produce terahertz radiation.\n", "  Using the fact that any linear representation of a group can be embedded into\npermutations, we propose a constructive description of quantum behavior that\nprovides, in particular, a natural explanation of the appearance of complex\nnumbers and unitarity in the formalism of quantum mechanics. In our approach,\nthe quantum behavior can be explained by the fundamental impossibility to trace\nthe identity of indistinguishable objects in their evolution. Any observation\nonly provides information about the invariant relations between such objects.\nThe trajectory of a quantum system is a sequence of unitary evolutions\ninterspersed with observations -- non-unitary projections. We suggest a scheme\nto construct combinatorial models of quantum evolution. The principle of\nselection of the most likely trajectories in such models via the large numbers\napproximation leads in the continuum limit to the principle of least action\nwith the appropriate Lagrangians and deterministic evolution equations.\n", "  The millimeter-wave polarization of the protoplanetary disk around HL Tau has\nbeen interpreted as the emission from elongated dust grains aligned with the\nmagnetic field in the disk. However, the self-scattering of thermal dust\nemission may also explain the observed millimeter-wave polarization. In this\npaper, we report a modeling of the millimeter-wave polarization of the HL Tau\ndisk with the self-polarization. Dust grains are assumed to be spherical and to\nhave a power-law size distribution. We change the maximum grain size with a\nfixed dust composition in a fixed disk model to find the grain size to\nreproduce the observed signature. We find that the direction of the\npolarization vectors and the polarization degree can be explained with the\nself-scattering. Moreover, the polarization degree can be explained only if the\nmaximum grain size is $\\sim 150 {\\rm~\\mu m}$. The obtained grain size from the\npolarization is different from a size of millimeter or larger that has been\npreviously expected from the spectral index of the dust opacity coefficient if\nthe emission is optically thin. We discuss that porous dust aggregates may\nsolve the inconsistency of the maximum grain size between the two constraints.\n", "  We analyse the OPE contribution of gluon bound states in the double scaling\nlimit of the hexagonal Wilson loop in planar N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. We\nprovide a systematic procedure for perturbatively resumming the contributions\nfrom single-particle bound states of gluons and expressing the result order by\norder in terms of two-variable polylogarithms. We also analyse certain\ncontributions from two-particle gluon bound states and find that, after\nanalytic continuation to the $2\\to 4$ Mandelstam region and passing to\nmulti-Regge kinematics (MRK), only the single-particle gluon bound states\ncontribute. From this double-scaled version of MRK we are able to reconstruct\nthe full hexagon remainder function in MRK up to five loops by invoking\nsingle-valuedness of the results.\n", "  We introduce a scalar-less anomaly free chiral gauge theory that serves as\nnatural ultraviolet completion of models of fundamental composite (Goldstone)\nHiggs dynamics. The new theory is able to generate the top mass and furthermore\nfeatures a built-in protection mechanism that naturally suppresses the bottom\nmass. At low energies the theory predicts new fractionally charged fermions,\nand a number of four-fermion operators that, besides being relevant for the\ngeneration of the top mass, also lead to an intriguing phenomenology for the\nnew states predicted by the theory.\n", "  In this paper, we review classical and quantum field theory of massive\nnon-interacting spin-two fields. We derive the equations of motion and\nFierz-Pauli constraints via three different methods: the eigenvalue equations\nfor the Casimir invariants of the Poincar\\'{e} group, a Lagrangian approach,\nand a covariant Hamilton formalism. We also present the conserved quantities,\nthe solution of the equations of motion in terms of polarization tensors, and\nthe tree-level propagator. We then discuss canonical quantization by\npostulating commutation relations for creation and annihilation operators. We\nexpress the energy, momentum, and spin operators in terms of the former. As an\napplication, quark-antiquark currents for tensor mesons are presented. In\nparticular, the current for tensor mesons with quantum numbers $J^{PC}=2^{-+}$\nis, to our knowledge, given here for the first time.\n", "  We investigate electron spin relaxation in GaAs in the proximity of a Fe/MgO\nlayer using spin-resolved optical pump-probe spectroscopy, revealing a strong\ndependence of the spin relaxation time on the strength of an exchange-driven\nhyperfine field. The temperature dependence of this effect reveals a strong\ncorrelation with carrier freeze out, implying that at low temperatures the free\ncarrier spin lifetime is dominated by inhomogeneity in the local hyperfine\nfield due to carrier localization. This result resolves a long-standing and\ncontentious question of the origin of the spin relaxation in GaAs at low\ntemperature when a magnetic field is present. Further, this improved\nfundamental understanding paves the way for future experiments exploring the\ntime-dependent exchange interaction at the ferromagnet/semiconductor interface\nand its impact on spin dissipation and transport in the regime of\ndynamically-driven spin pumping.\n", "  We study quantum electrodynamics with 2+1 dimensional massless Dirac fermion\naround a Coulomb impurity. Around a large charge with atomic number Z > 137,\nthe QED vacuum is expected to collapse due to the strong Coulombic force. While\nthe relativistic quantum mechanics fails to make reliable predictions for the\nfate of the vacuum, the heavy ion collision experiment also does not give clear\nunderstanding of this system. Recently, the \"atomic collapse\" resonances were\nobserved on graphene where an artificial nuclei can be made. In this paper, we\npresent our nonperturbative study of the vacuum structure of the quasiparticles\nin graphene with a charge impurity which contains multi-body effect using\nbosonization method.\n", "  A numerical study of a pseudoscalar inflation having an axion-photon-like\ncoupling is performed by solving numerically the coupled differential equations\nof motion for inflaton and photon mode functions from the onset of inflation to\nthe end of reheating. The backreaction due to particle production is also\nincluded self-consistently. We find that this particular inflation model\nrealizes the idea of a warm inflation in which a steady thermal bath is\nestablished by the particle production. In most cases this thermal bath exceeds\nthe amount of radiation released in the reheating process. In the strong\ncoupling regime, the transition from the inflationary to the\nradiation-dominated phase does not involve either a preheating or reheating\nprocess. In addition, energy density peaks produced near the end of inflation\nmay lead to the formation of primordial black holes.\n", "  In a recent paper, the authors established the uniqueness of photon spheres\nin static vacuum asymptotically flat spacetimes by adapting Bunting and\nMasood-ul-Alam's proof of static vacuum black hole uniqueness. Here, we\nestablish uniqueness of suitably defined sub-extremal photon spheres in static\nelectro-vacuum asymptotically flat spacetimes by adapting the argument of\nMasood-ul-Alam. As a consequence of our result, we can rule out the existence\nof electrostatic configurations involving multiple \"very compact\" electrically\ncharged bodies and sub-extremal black holes.\n", "  Motivated by experiments in Munich (M. Schreiber et. al. Science\n\\textbf{349}, 842), we study the dynamics of interacting fermions initially\nprepared in charge density wave states in one-dimensional bichromatic optical\nlattices. The experiment sees a marked lack of thermalization, which has been\ntaken as evidence for an interacting generalization of Anderson localization,\ndubbed \"many-body localization\". We model the experiments using an interacting\nAubry-Andre model and develop a computationally efficient low-density cluster\nexpansion to calculate the even-odd density imbalance as a function of\ninteraction strength and potential strength. Our calculations agree with the\nexperimental results and shed light on the phenomena. We also explore a\ntwo-dimensional generalization. The cluster expansion method we develop should\nhave broad applicability to similar problems in non-equilibrium quantum\nphysics.\n", "  The large error of the DFT+U method on full-filled shell metal oxides is due\nto the residue of self-energy from the localized d orbitals of cations and p\norbitals of the anions. U parameters are self-consistently found to achieve the\nanalytical self-energy cancellation. The improved band structures based on\nrelaxed lattices of ${Cu_{2}O}$ are shown based on minimization of self-energy\nerror. The experimentally reported intrinsic p-type trap levels are contributed\nby both Cu-vacancy and the O-interstitial defects in ${{Cu}_{2}O}$. The latter\ndefect has the lowest formation energy but contributes a deep hole trap level\nwhile the Cu-vacancy has higher energy cost but acting as a shallow acceptor.\nBoth present single-particle levels spread over nearby the valence band edge,\nconsistent to the trend of defects transition levels. By this calculation\napproach, we also elucidated the entanglement of strong p-d orbital coupling to\nunravel the screened Coulomb potential of fully filled shells.\n", "  Despite having the simplest atomic structure, bulk FeSe has an observed\nelectronic structure with the largest deviation from the band theory\npredictions among all Fe-based superconductors and exhibits a low temperature\nnematic electronic state without intervening magnetic order. We show that the\nFe-Fe interatomic Coulomb repulsion $V$ offers a natural explanation for the\npuzzling electron correlation effects in FeSe superconductors. It produces a\nstrongly renormalized low-energy band structure where the van Hove singularity\nsits remarkably close to Fermi level in the high-temperature electron liquid\nphase as observed experimentally. This proximity enables the quantum\nfluctuations in $V$ to induce a rotational symmetry breaking electronic bond\norder in the $d$-wave channel. We argue that this emergent low-temperature\n$d$-wave bond nematic state, different from the commonly discussed\nferro-orbital order and spin-nematicity, has been observed recently by several\nangle resolved photoemission experiments detecting the lifting of the band\ndegeneracies at high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. We present a\nsymmetry analysis of the space group and identify the hidden antiunitary\n$T$-symmetry that protects the band degeneracy and the electronic\norder/interaction that can break the symmetry and lift the degeneracy. We show\nthat the $d$-wave nematic bond order, together with the spin-orbit coupling,\nprovide a unique explanation of the temperature dependence, momentum space\nanisotropy, and domain effects observed experimentally. We discuss the\nimplications of our findings on the structural transition, the absence of\nmagnetic order, and the intricate competition between nematicity and\nsuperconductivity in FeSe superconductors.\n", "  Measuring the $ac$ magnetic response of a type II superconductor provides\nvaluable information on the pinning landscape (pinscape) of the material. We\nuse strong pinning theory to derive a microscopic expression for the Campbell\nlength $\\lambda_{\\rm \\scriptscriptstyle C}$, the penetration depth of the $ac$\nsignal. We show that $\\lambda_{\\rm \\scriptscriptstyle C}$ is determined by the\njump in the pinning force, in contrast to the critical current $j_c$ which\ninvolves the jump in pinning energy. We demonstrate that the Campbell lengths\ngenerically differ for zero-field-cooled and field-cooled samples and predict\nthat hysteretic behavior can appear in the latter situation. We compare our\nfindings with new experimental data and show the potential of this technique in\nproviding information on the material's pinscape.\n", "  We report on a single-photon-to-single-atom interface, where a single photon\ngenerated by Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) is absorbed by a\nsingle trapped ion. The photon is heralded by its time-correlated partner\ngenerated in the SPDC process, while the absorption event is heralded by a\nsingle photon emitted in its course. Coincidence detection marks\ndoubly-heralded absorption, enabling photon-to-atom quantum state transfer [1,\n2]. Background in the coincidence measurement is strongly suppressed by a new\nmethod that discriminates real absorption events from dark count-induced\ncoincidences.\n", "  We theoretically model the electronic dynamics of a coupled quantum dot pair\nin a static electric field. We then investigate the possibility of\npolarization-entangled photon emission from the radiative cascade of the\nmolecular biexciton state. Through numerical simulations, we analyze the\ndependence of entanglement fidelity on temperature and electric field, as well\nas tunnel coupling. We establish a regime of direct-indirect exciton detunings\nfor which coupled quantum dots are superior to single dots for entangled photon\ngeneration, yielding near-unit fidelity over a larger range of exchange\nsplittings.\n", "  The problem of finding a marked node in a graph can be solved by the spatial\nsearch algorithm based on continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW). However, this\nalgorithm is known to run in optimal time only for a handful of graphs. In this\nwork, we prove that for Erd\\\"os-Renyi random graphs, i.e.\\ graphs of $n$\nvertices where each edge exists with probability $p$, search by CTQW is\n\\textit{almost surely} optimal as long as $p\\geq \\log^{3/2}(n)/n$.\nConsequently, we show that quantum spatial search is in fact optimal for\n\\emph{almost all} graphs, meaning that the fraction of graphs of $n$ vertices\nfor which this optimality holds tends to one in the asymptotic limit. We obtain\nthis result by proving that search is optimal on graphs where the ratio between\nthe second largest and the largest eigenvalue is bounded by a constant smaller\nthan 1. Finally, we show that we can extend our results on search to establish\nhigh fidelity quantum communication between two arbitrary nodes of a random\nnetwork of interacting qubits, namely to perform quantum state transfer, as\nwell as entanglement generation. Our work shows that quantum information tasks\ntypically designed for structured systems retain performance in very disordered\nstructures.\n", "  The penetration of an $ac$ magnetic signal into a type II superconductor\nresiding in the Shubnikov phase depends on the pinning properties of Abrikosov\nvortices. Within a phenomenological theory, the so-called Campbell penetration\ndepth $\\lambda_{\\rm \\scriptscriptstyle C}$ is determined by the curvature\n$\\alpha$ at the bottom of the effective pinning potential. Preparing the sample\ninto a Bean critical state, this curvature vanishes and the Campbell length\nformally diverges. We make use of the microscopic expression for the pinning\nforce density derived within strong pinning theory and show how flux\npenetration on top of a critical state proceeds in a regular way.\n", "  The implications of the recent classical nonlocal generalization of\nEinstein's theory of gravitation for gravitational physics in the Solar System\nare investigated. In this theory, the nonlocal character of gravity appears to\nsimulate dark matter. Nonlocal gravity in the Newtonian regime involves a\nreciprocal kernel with three spatial parameters, of which two have already been\ndetermined from the rotation curves of spiral galaxies and the internal\ndynamics of clusters of galaxies. However, the short-range parameter a_0\nremains to be determined. In this connection, the nonlocal contribution to the\nperihelion precession of a planetary orbit is estimated and a preliminary lower\nlimit on a_0 is determined.\n", "  The relationship between the foundations of mathematics and physics is a\ntopic of of much interest. This paper continues this exploration by examination\nof the effect of space and time dependent number scaling on theoretical\ndescriptions of some physical and geometric quantities. Fiber bundles provide a\ngood framework to introduce a space and time or space time dependent number\nscaling field. The effect of the scaling field on a few nonlocal physical and\ngeometric quantities is described. The effect on gauge theories is to introduce\na new complex scalar field into the derivatives appearing in Lagrangians. U(1)\ninvariance of Lagrangian terms does not affect the real part of the scaling\nfield. For this field, any mass is possible. The scaling field is also shown to\naffect quantum wave packets and path lengths, and geodesic equations even on\nflat space. Scalar fields described so far in physics, are possible candidates\nfor the scaling field. The lack of direct evidence for the field in physics\nrestricts the scaling field in that the gradient of the field must be close to\nzero in a local region of cosmological space and time. There are no\nrestrictions outside the region. It is also seen that the scaling field does\nnot affect comparisons of computation or measurements outputs with one another.\nHowever it does affect the assignment of numerical values to the outputs of\ncomputations or measurements. These are needed because theory predictions are\nin terms of numerical values.\n", "  We present a holistic Bayesian hierarchical model for reconstructing the\ncontinuous and dynamic evolution of relative sea-level (RSL) change with fully\nquantified uncertainty. The reconstruction is produced from biological\n(foraminifera) and geochemical ({\\delta}13C) sea-level indicators preserved in\ndated cores of salt-marsh sediment. Our model is comprised of three modules:\n(1) A Bayesian transfer function for the calibration of foraminifera into tidal\nelevation, which is flexible enough to formally accommodate additional proxies\n(in this case bulk-sediment {\\delta}13C values); (2) A chronology developed\nfrom an existing Bchron age-depth model, and (3) An existing\nerrors-in-variables integrated Gaussian process (EIV-IGP) model for estimating\nrates of sea-level change. We illustrate our approach using a case study of\nCommon Era sea-level variability from New Jersey, U.S.A. We develop a new\nBayesian transfer function (B-TF), with and without the {\\delta}13C proxy and\ncompare our results to those from a widely-used weighted-averaging transfer\nfunction (WA-TF). The formal incorporation of a second proxy into the B-TF\nmodel results in smaller vertical uncertainties and improved accuracy for\nreconstructed RSL. The vertical uncertainty from the multi-proxy B-TF is ~28%\nsmaller on average compared to the WA-TF. When evaluated against historic\ntide-gauge measurements, the multi-proxy B-TF most accurately reconstructs the\nRSL changes observed in the instrumental record (MSE = 0.003). The holistic\nmodel provides a single, unifying framework for reconstructing and analysing\nsea level through time. This approach is suitable for reconstructing other\npaleoenvironmental variables using biological proxies.\n", "  We present numerical studies of wetting on various topographic substrates,\nincluding random topographies. We find good agreement with recent predictions\nbased on an analytical interface-displacement-type theory\n\\cite{Herminghaus2012, Herminghaus2012a}. The phase diagrams are qualitatively\nas predicted, but differently in this study the critical points are found to\nlie within the physical parameter range (i.e., at positive contact angle) in\nall cases studied. Notably, it is corroborated that Gaussian random surfaces\nbehave qualitatively different from all non-Gaussian topographies investigated,\nexhibiting a qualitatively different phase diagram. This shows that Gaussian\nrandom surfaces must be used with great care in the context of wetting\nphenomena.\n", "  Network is a simple but powerful representation of real-world complex\nsystems. Network community analysis has become an invaluable tool to explore\nand reveal the internal organization of nodes. However, only a few methods were\ndirectly designed for community-detection in directed networks. In this\narticle, we introduce the concept of local community structure in directed\nnetworks and provide a generic criterion to describe a local community with two\nproperties. We further propose a stochastic optimization algorithm to rapidly\ndetect a local community, which allows for uncovering the directional modular\ncharacteristics in directed networks. Numerical results show that the proposed\nmethod can resolve detailed local communities with directional information and\nprovide more structural characteristics of directed networks than previous\nmethods.\n", "  We investigate the role of electronic-vibrational coupling in resonant\nelectron transport through single-molecule junctions, taking into account that\nthe corresponding coupling strengths may depend on the charge and excitation\nstate of the molecular bridge. In the presence of multiple electronic states,\nthis requires to extend the commonly used model and include vibrationally\ndependent electron-electron interaction. We use Born-Markov master equation\nmethods and consider selected models to exemplify the effect of the additional\ninteraction on the transport characteristics of a single-molecule junction. In\nparticular, we show that it has a significant influence on local cooling and\nheating mechanisms, may result in negative differential resistance, and cause\npronounced asymmetries in the conductance map of a single-molecule junction.\n", "  We study four-point correlation functions of four generic half-BPS\nsupermultiplets of N=4 SCFT in four dimensions. We use the two-particle Casimir\nof four-dimensional superconformal algebra to derive superconformal blocks\nwhich contribute to the partial wave expansion of such correlators. The derived\nblocks are defined on analytic superspace and allow us in principle to find any\ncomponent of the four-point correlator. The lowest component of the result\nagrees with the superconformal blocks found by Dolan and Osborn.\n", "  The effects of kinematic cuts on electric charge fluctuations in a gas of\ncharged particles are discussed. We consider a very transparent example of an\nideal pion gas with quantum statistics, which can be viewed as a\nmulti-component gas of Boltzmann particles with different charges and masses.\nCumulants of net-electric charge fluctuations $\\chi_n^Q$ are calculated in a\nstatic and expanding medium with flow parameters adjusted to the experimental\ndata. We show that the transverse momentum cut, $p_{t_\\text{min}}\\leq p_t\\leq\np_{t_\\text{max}}$, weakens the effects of Bose statistics, i.e. contributions\nof effectively multi-charged states to higher order moments. Consequently, cuts\nin $p_t$ modify the experimentally measured cumulants and their ratios. We\ndiscuss the influence of kinematic cuts on the ratio of mean and variance of\nelectric charge fluctuations in a hadron resonance gas, in the light of recent\ndata of the STAR and PHENIX Collaborations. We find that the different momentum\ncuts of $p_{t_\\text{min}}=0.2$~GeV (STAR) and $p_{t_\\text{min}}=0.3$~GeV\n(PHENIX) are responsible for more than 30\\% of the difference between these two\ndata sets. We argue that the $p_t$ cuts imposed on charged particles will\ninfluence the normalized kurtosis {$\\kappa_Q\\sigma_Q^2 = \\chi_4^Q/\\chi_2^Q$} of\nthe electric charge fluctuations. In particular, the reduction of\n$\\kappa_Q\\sigma_Q^2$ with increasing $p_{t_\\text{min}}$ will lead to\ndifferences between PHENIX and STAR data of ${\\cal O}(6\\%)$ which currently are\nburied under large statistical and systematic errors. We furthermore introduce\nthe relation between momentum cut-off and finite volume effects, which is of\nrelevance for the comparison between experimental data and lattice QCD\ncalculations.\n", "  We present a theoretical framework to analyze the dynamics of gene expression\nwith stochastic bursts. Beginning with an individual-based model which fully\naccounts for the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein populations, we propose a\nnovel expansion of the master equation for the joint process. The resulting\ncoarse-grained model reduces the dimensionality of the system, describing only\nthe protein population while fully accounting for the effects of discrete and\nfluctuating mRNA population. Closed form expressions for the stationary\ndistribution of the protein population and mean first-passage times of the\ncoarse-grained model are derived and large-scale Monte Carlo simulations show\nthat the analysis accurately describes the individual-based process accounting\nfor mRNA population, in contrast to the failure of commonly proposed\ndiffusion-type models.\n", "  We use scanning tunneling microscopy to study the lithium purple bronze\n(Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_{6}$O$_{17}$) at room temperature. Our measurements allow us to\nidentify the single-crystal cleave plane and show that it is possible to obtain\nclean cleaved surfaces reflecting the crystal structure without the\ncomplications of nanoscale surface disorder. In addition to the crystal\nlattice, we observe a coexisting discommensurate superlattice with wavevectors\nq = 0.5a* $\\pm$ 0.25b*. We propose that the origin of the superstructure is a\nsurface reconstruction which is driven by cleaving along a crystal plane which\ncontains in-plane MoO$_{4}$ tetrahedra connected to out-of-plane MoO$_{6}$\noctahedra through corner-sharing oxygens. When combined with spectroscopic\nmeasurements, our studies show a promising avenue through which to study the\ncomplex physics within Li$_{0.9}$Mo$_{6}$O$_{17}$.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of high aspect ratio nanowires trapped axially in\na single gradient force optical tweezers. A power spectrum analysis of the\nBrownian dynamics reveals a broad spectral resonance of the order of a kHz with\npeak properties that are strongly dependent on the input trapping power.\nModelling of the dynamical equations of motion of the trapped nanowire that\nincorporate non-conservative effects through asymmetric coupling between\ntranslational and rotational degrees of freedom provides excellent agreement\nwith the experimental observations. An associated observation of persistent\ncyclical motion around the equilibrium trapping position using winding analysis\nprovides further evidence for the influence of non-conservative forces.\n", "  An efficient density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm is\npresented and applied to Y-junctions, systems with three arms of $n$ sites that\nmeet at a central site. The accuracy is comparable to DMRG of chains. As in\nchains, new sites are always bonded to the most recently added sites and the\nsuperblock Hamiltonian contains only new or once renormalized operators.\nJunctions of up to $N = 3n + 1 \\approx 500$ sites are studied with\nantiferromagnetic (AF) Heisenberg exchange $J$ between nearest-neighbor spins\n$S$ or electron transfer $t$ between nearest neighbors in half-filled Hubbard\nmodels. Exchange or electron transfer is exclusively between sites in two\nsublattices with $N_A \\ne N_B$. The ground state (GS) and spin densities $\n\\rho_r = <S^z_r >$ at site $r$ are quite different for junctions with $S$ =\n1/2, 1, 3/2 and 2. The GS has finite total spin $S_G = 2S (S)$ for even (odd)\n$N$ and for $M_G =S_G$ in the $S_G$ spin manifold, $\\rho_r > 0 (< 0)$ at sites\nof the larger (smaller) sublattice. $S$ = 1/2 junctions have delocalized states\nand decreasing spin densities with increasing $N$. $S$ = 1 junctions have four\nlocalized $S_z = 1/2$ states at the end of each arm and centered on the\njunction, consistent with localized states in $S$ = 1 chains with finite\nHaldane gap. The GS of $S$ = 3/2 or 2 junctions of up to 500 spins is a spin\ndensity wave (SDW) with increased amplitude at the ends of arms or near the\njunction. Quantum fluctuations completely suppress AF order in $S$ = 1/2 or 1\njunctions, as well as in half-filled Hubbard junctions, but reduce rather than\nsuppress AF order in $S$ = 3/2 or 2 junctions.\n", "  Can a white dwarf, accreting hydrogen-rich matter from a non-degenerate\ncompanion star, ever exceed the Chandrasekhar mass and explode as a type Ia\nsupernova? We explore the range of accretion rates that allow a white dwarf\n(WD) to secularly grow in mass, and derive limits on the accretion rate and on\nthe initial mass that will allow it to reach $1.4M_\\odot$ --- the Chandrasekhar\nmass. We follow the evolution through a long series of hydrogen flashes, during\nwhich a thick helium shell accumulates. This determines the effective helium\nmass accretion rate for long-term, self-consistent evolutionary runs with\nhelium flashes. We find that net mass accumulation always occurs despite helium\nflashes. Although the amount of mass lost during the first few helium shell\nflashes is a significant fraction of that accumulated prior to the flash, that\nfraction decreases with repeated helium shell flashes. Eventually no mass is\nejected at all during subsequent flashes. This unexpected result occurs because\nof continual heating of the WD interior by the helium shell flashes near its\nsurface. The effect of heating is to lower the electron degeneracy throughout\nthe WD, and especially in the outer layers. This key result yields helium\nburning that is quasi-steady state, instead of explosive. We thus find a\nremarkably large parameter space within which long-term, self-consistent\nsimulations show that a WD can grow in mass and reach the Chandrasekhar limit,\ndespite its helium flashes.\n", "  Collisions of composite particles impose an arbitrary boost in the\nlongitudinal direction on a given event. This implies that the centre-of-mass\nframe at hadron colliders is undetermined for processes with missing energy in\nthe final state. This motivates the modification of the Fox-Wolfram moments\nsuch that the moments for a given event are identical when viewed in the lab or\ncentre-of-mass frame of the beam. The resulting moments are invariant under\nrotations in the plane transverse to the beam and boosts parallel to the beam.\nThese moments are then used to demonstrate improved signal separation in the\nchannel where the Higgs decays to two b-quarks while being produced in\nassociation with a vector boson.\n", "  We propose a new definition for the abelian magnetic charge density of a\nnon-abelian monopole, based on zero-modes of an associated Dirac operator.\nUnlike the standard definition of the charge density, this density is smooth in\nthe core of the monopole. We show that this charge density induces a magnetic\nfield whose expansion in powers of 1/r agrees with that of the conventional\nasymptotic magnetic field to all orders. We also show that the asymptotic field\ncan be easily calculated from the spectral curve. Explicit examples are given\nfor known monopole solutions.\n", "  With A Multi-Phase Transport (AMPT) model we investigate the relation between\nthe magnitude, fluctuations and correlations of the initial state spatial\nanisotropy $\\varepsilon_{n}$ and the final state anisotropic flow coefficients\n$v_{n}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\rm NN}}}=$ 200 GeV. It is found\nthat the relative eccentricity fluctuations in AMPT account for the observed\nelliptic flow fluctuations, in agreement with measurements of the STAR\ncollaboration. In addition, the studies based on 2- and multi-particle\ncorrelations and event-by-event distributions of the anisotropies suggest that\nthe Elliptic-Power function is a promising candidate of the underlying\nprobability density function of the event-by-event distributions of\n$\\varepsilon_{n}$ as well as $v_{n}$. Furthermore, the correlations between\ndifferent order symmetry planes and harmonics in the initial coordinate space\nand final state momentum space are presented. Non-zero values of these\ncorrelations have been observed. The comparison between our calculations and\ndata will, in the future, shed new insight into the nature of the fluctuations\nof the Quark-Gluon Plasma produced in heavy ion collisions.\n", "  We present a range-separated linear-response time-dependent\ndensity-functional theory (TDDFT) which combines a density-functional\napproximation for the short-range response kernel and a frequency-dependent\nsecond-order Bethe-Salpeter approximation for the long-range response kernel.\nThis approach goes beyond the adiabatic approximation usually used in\nlinear-response TDDFT and aims at improving the accuracy of calculations of\nelectronic excitation energies of molecular systems. A detailed derivation of\nthe frequency-dependent second-order Bethe-Salpeter correlation kernel is given\nusing many-body Green-function theory. Preliminary tests of this\nrange-separated TDDFT method are presented for the calculation of excitation\nenergies of the He and Be atoms and small molecules (H2, N2, CO2, H2CO, and\nC2H4). The results suggest that the addition of the long-range second-order\nBethe-Salpeter correlation kernel overall slightly improves the excitation\nenergies.\n", "  Membranes in M-theory are expected to interact via splitting and joining\nprocesses. We study these effects in the pp-wave matrix model, in which they\nare associated with transitions between states in sectors built on vacua with\ndifferent numbers of membranes. Transition amplitudes between such states\nreceive contributions from BPS instanton configurations interpolating between\nthe different vacua. Various properties of the moduli space of BPS instantons\nare known, but there are very few known examples of explicit solutions. We\npresent a new approach to the construction of instanton solutions interpolating\nbetween states containing arbitrary numbers of membranes, based on a continuum\napproximation valid for matrices of large size. The proposed scheme uses\nfunctions on a two-dimensional space to approximate matrices and it relies on\nthe same ideas behind the matrix regularisation of membrane degrees of freedom\nin M-theory. We show that the BPS instanton equations have a continuum\ncounterpart which can be mapped to the three-dimensional Laplace equation\nthrough a sequence of changes of variables. A description of configurations\ncorresponding to membrane splitting/joining processes can be given in terms of\nsolutions to the Laplace equation in a three-dimensional analog of a Riemann\nsurface, consisting of multiple copies of R^3 connected via a generalisation of\nbranch cuts. We discuss various general features of our proposal and we also\npresent explicit analytic solutions.\n", "  We investigate partially disordered antiferromagnetism in\nCoCl$_2$-2SC(NH$_2$)$_2$, in which a-b plane hexagonal layers are staggered\nalong the c-axis, rather than stacked. A robust 1/3 state forms in applied\nmagnetic fields which the spins are locked, varying neither as a function of\ntemperature nor field. By contrast, in zero field, partial antiferromagnetic\norder occurs, in which free spins are available to create a Curie-like magnetic\nsusceptibility. We report measurements of the crystallographic structure, and\nthe specific heat, magnetization, and electric polarization down to $T$ = 50 mK\nand up to $\\mu_{0}H$ = 60 T. The Co$^{2+}$ $S = 3/2$ spins are Ising-like and\nform distorted hexagonal layers. The Ising energy scale is well separated from\nthe magnetic exchange, and both energy scales are accessible to the\nmeasurements allowing us to cleanly parameterize them. In transverse fields, a\nquantum Ising phase transition can be observed at 2 T. Finally we find that\nmagnetic exchange striction induces changes in the electric polarization up to\n3 $\\mu$C/m$^2$ and single-ion magnetic anisotropy effects induce a much a\nlarger electric polarization change of 300 $\\mu$C/m$^2$.\n", "  The recently discovered chimera state involves the coexistence of\nsynchronized and desynchronized states for a group of identical oscillators.\nThis fascinating chimera state has until now been found only in non-local or\nglobally coupled oscillator systems. In this work, we for the first time show\nnumerical evidence of the existence of spiral wave chimeras in\nreaction-diffusion systems where each element is locally coupled by diffusion.\nThis spiral wave chimera rotates inwardly, i.e., coherent waves propagate\ntoward the phase randomized core. A continuous transition from spiral waves\nwith smooth core to spiral wave chimeras is found as we change the local\ndynamics of the system. Our findings on the spiral wave chimera in locally\ncoupled oscillator systems largely improve our understanding of the chimera\nstate and suggest that spiral chimera states may be found in natural systems\nwhich can be modeled by a set of oscillators indirectly coupled by a diffusive\nenvironment.\n", "  We study the application of the rules of Thermo Field Dynamics (TFD) to the\ncovariant formulation of Open String Field Theory (OSFT). We extend the states\nspace and fields according to the duplication rules of TFD and construct the\ncorresponding classical action. The result is interpreted as a theory whose\nfields would encode the statistical information of open strings.\n  The physical spectrum of the free theory is studied through the cohomology of\nthe extended BRST charge, and, as a result, we get new fields in the spectrum\nemerging by virtue of the quantum entanglement and, noticeably, it presents\ndegrees of freedom that could be identified as those of closed strings. We also\nshow, however, that their appearing in the action is directly related to the\nchoice of the inner product in the extended algebra, so that different sectors\nof fields could be eliminated from the theory by choosing that product\nconveniently.\n  Finally, we study the extension of the three-vertex interaction and provide a\nsimple prescription for it whose results at tree-level agree with those of the\nconventional theory.\n", "  Understanding ballistic phonon transport effects in transient\nthermoreflectance experiments and explaining the observed deviations from\nclassical theory remains a challenge. Diffusion equations are simple and\ncomputationally efficient but are widely believed to break down when the\ncharacteristic length scale is similar or less than the phonon mean-free-path.\nBuilding on our prior work, we demonstrate how well-known diffusion equations,\nnamely the hyperbolic heat equation and the Cattaneo equation, can be used to\nmodel ballistic phonon effects in frequency-dependent periodic steady-state\nthermal transport. Our analytical solutions are found to compare excellently to\nrigorous numerical results of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. The\ncorrect physical boundary conditions can be different from those traditionally\nused and are paramount for accurately capturing ballistic effects. To\nillustrate the technique, we consider a simple model problem using two\ndifferent, commonly-used heating conditions. We demonstrate how this framework\ncan easily handle detailed material properties, by considering the case of bulk\nsilicon using a full phonon dispersion and mean-free-path distribution. This\nphysically transparent approach provides clear insights into the nonequilibrium\nphysics of quasi-ballistic phonon transport and its impact on thermal transport\nproperties.\n", "  We develop the framework of boundary derivative expansion (BDE) formalism of\nfluid/gravity correspondence in compactified D4-brane system, which is a\nnonconformal background used in top-down holographic QCD models. Such models\ncontain the D4-D6 model and the Sakai-Sugimoto (SS) model, with the background\nof the compactified black D4 branes under the near horizon limit. By using the\ndimensional reduction technique, we derive a 5D Einstein gravity minimally\ncoupled with 3 scalar fields from the 10D D4-brane background. Following the\nBDE formalism of fluid/gravity correspondence in the conformal background, we\ndirectly derive all the first order transport coefficients for nonconformal\ngluonic matter. The results of the ratio of the bulk to shear viscosity and the\nsound speed agree with those obtained from the Green-Kubo method. This\nagreement guarantees the validity of the BDE formalism of fluid/gravity duality\nin the nonconformal D-brane background, which can be used to calculate the\nsecond order transport coefficients in nonconformal background.\n", "  Vapor deposition on polycrystalline films can lead to staggering levels of\ncompressive stress, exceeding even the yield strength of the films.\nMysteriously, a significant part of this stress has a reversible nature: it\ndisappears when the deposition is stopped and re-emerges upon resumption.\nAlthough numerous mechanisms have been proposed to explain these effects, the\norigin of the phenomenon remains still unclear. The incorporation of atoms in\nthe grain boundaries is, to our opinion, the most likely mechanism, but the\nrequired driving force for it has not yet been addressed. Therefore, instead of\nsearching for a specific (atomic) incorporation process, we analyze, here, the\nentire film system using thermodynamic arguments only. We find that the\ntremendous stress levels observed in the experiments can be surprisingly\nexplained by the flux induced entropic effects in the extremely dilute adatom\ngas on the surface alone. This thermodynamic evaluation delivers not only the\nnecessary basis for the adatom incorporation models, it even shows that the\nmeasured stress values can be reached with low deposition fluxes. Finally,\nfully counterintuitive, we also show that the stress levels decrease, if the\nbarrier(s) for adatoms to reach the grain boundaries are decreased!\n", "  Axion like particles (ALPs) are quite generic in many scenarios for physics\nbeyond the Standard Model, they are pseudoscalar Nambu-Goldstone bosons, and\nappear once any global $U(1)$ symmetry is broken spontaneously. The ALPs can\ngain mass from various non-perturbative quantum effects, such as anomalies or\ninstantons. ALPs can couple to the matter sector incluidng a scalar condensate\nsuch as inflaton or moduli field via derivative interactions, which are\nsuppressed by the axion {\\it decay constant}, $f_\\chi$ . Although weakly\ninteracting, the ALPs can be produced abundantly from the coherent oscillations\nof a homogeneous condensate. In this paper we will study such a scenario where\nthe ALPs can be produced abundantly, and in some cases can even overclose the\nUniverse via odd and even dimensional operators, as long as $f_\\chi/\\Phi_{\\rm\nI} \\ll 1$, where $\\Phi_{\\rm I}$ denotes the initial amplitude of the coherent\noscillations of the scalar condensate, $\\phi$. We will briefly mention how such\ndangerous overproduction would affect dark matter and dark radiation abundances\nin the Universe.\n", "  We introduce and consider the notion of stable degeneracies of translation\ninvariant energy functions for finite Ising models. By this term we mean the\nlack of injectivity that cannot be lifted by changing the interaction.\n  We show that besides the symmetry-induced degeneracies, related to spin flip,\ntranslation and reflection, there exist additional stable degeneracies, due to\nmore subtle symmetries. One such symmetry is the one of the Singer group of a\nfinite projective plane. Others are described by combinatorial relations akin\nto trace identities.\n  Our results resemble traits of the length spectrum for closed geodesics on a\nRiemannian surface of constant negative curvature. There stable degeneracy is\ndefined w.r.t. Teichm\\\"uller space as parameter space.\n", "  We first investigate the gravitational wave in the flat Finsler spacetime. In\nthe Finslerian universe, we derive the perturbed gravitational field equation\nwith tensor perturbations. The Finslerian background spacetime breaks\nrotational symmetry and induces parity violation. Then we obtain the modified\nprimordial power spectrum of tensor perturbations. The parity violation feature\nrequires that the anisotropic effect contributes to $TT,TE,EE,BB$ angular\ncorrelation coefficients with $l'=l+1$ and $TB,EB$ with $l'=l$. The numerical\nresults show that the anisotropic contributions to angular correlation\ncoefficients depend on $m$, and $TE$ and $ET$ angular correlation coefficients\nare different.\n", "  Many hybrid models of heavy ion collisions construct the initial state for\nhydrodynamics from transport models. Hydrodynamics requires that the\nenergy-momentum tensor $T^{\\mu\\nu}$ and four-currents $j^{\\mu}$ do not deviate\nconsiderably from the equilibrium ideal-fluid form, but the ones constructed\nfrom transport do not necessarily possess this property. In this work we\ninvestigate the space-time picture of $T^{\\mu\\nu}$ deviations from equilibrium\nin Au+Au collisions using a coarse-grained transport approach. The collision\nenergy is varied in the range $E_{lab} = 5-160A$ GeV. The sensitivity of\n$T^{\\mu\\nu}$ deviations from equilibrium to collision centrality, and other\nparameters such as the switching criterion, the amount of statistics used to\nconstruct the initial state, and the smearing parameter $\\sigma$ is\ninvestigated. For low statistics deviations of $T^{\\mu\\nu}$ from equilibrium\nare large and dominated by the effect of finite sampling. For large statistics\nthe pressure anisotropy plays the most significant role, while the off-diagonal\ncomponents of $T^{\\mu\\nu}$ are small in a large volume during the whole\nevolution. For all considered energies and centralities the pressure anisotropy\nexhibits a similar feature: there is a narrow interval of time, when it rapidly\ndrops in a considerable volume. This allows us to introduce an \"isotropization\ntime,\" which is found to decrease with energy and slightly increase with\ncentrality. The isotropization times are larger than times typically used for\ninitializing hydrodynamics.\n", "  Solid-state nanopores are single molecule sensors that measure changes in\nionic current as charged polymers such as DNA pass through. Here, we present\ncomprehensive experiments on the length, voltage and salt dependence of the\nfrequency of double-stranded DNA translocations through conical quartz\nnanopores with mean opening diameter 15 nm. We observe an entropic barrier\nlimited, length dependent translocation frequency at 4M LiCl salt concentration\nand a drift-dominated, length independent translocation frequency at 1M KCl\nsalt concentration. These observations are described by a unifying\nconvection-diffusion equation which includes the contribution of an entropic\nbarrier for polymer entry.\n", "  Motivated by its well defined higher dimensional origin, a detailed study of\n$D=4$ $\\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity with a dyonically gauged $\\textrm{ISO}(7) =\n\\textrm{SO}(7) \\ltimes \\mathbb{R}^7$ gauge group is performed. We write down\nthe Lagrangian and describe the tensor and duality hierarchies, focusing on an\ninteresting subsector with closed field equations and supersymmetry\ntransformations. We then truncate the $\\mathcal{N}=8$ theory to some smaller\nsectors with $\\mathcal{N}=2$ and $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry and SU(3),\n$\\textrm{G}_2$ and SO(4) bosonic symmetry. Canonical and superpotential\nformulations for these sectors are given, and their vacuum structure and\nspectra is analysed. Unlike the purely electric ISO(7) gauging, the dyonic\ngauging displays a rich structure of vacua, all of them AdS. We recover all\npreviously known ones and find a new $\\mathcal{N}=1$ vacuum with SU(3) symmetry\nand various non-supersymmetric vacua, all of them stable within the full\n$\\mathcal{N}=8$ theory.\n", "  We present the first study to synthesize results from five different\nexoplanet surveys using three independent detection methods: microlensing,\nradial velocity, and direct imaging. The constraints derived herein represent\nthe most comprehensive picture of the demographics of large-separation (>~ 2\nAU) planets orbiting the most common stars in our Galaxy that has been\nconstructed to date. We assume a simple, joint power-law planet distribution\nfunction of the form d^2N_{pl}/[dlog(m_p)dlog(a)] =\nA(m_p/M_{Sat})^{alpha}(a/2.5 AU)^{beta} with an outer cutoff radius of the\nseparation distribution function of a_{out}. Generating populations of planets\nfrom these models and mapping them into the relevant observables for each\nsurvey, we use actual or estimated detection sensitivities to determine the\nexpected observations for each survey. Comparing with the reported results, we\nderive constraints on the parameters {alpha, beta, A, a_{out}} that describe a\nsingle population of planets that is simultaneously consistent with the results\nof microlensing, RV, and direct imaging surveys. We find median and 68%\nconfindence intervals of alpha = -0.86^{+0.21}_{-0.19} (-0.85^{+0.21}_{-0.19}),\nbeta = 1.1^{+1.9}_{-1.4} (1.1^{+1.9}_{-1.3}), A = 0.21^{+0.20}_{-0.15} dex^{-2}\n(0.21^{+0.20}_{-0.15} dex^{-2}), and a_{out} = 10^{+26}_{-4.7} AU\n(12^{+50}_{-6.2} AU) assuming \"hot-start\" (\"cold-start\") planet evolutionary\nmodels. These values are consistent with all current knowledge of planets on\norbits beyond ~2 AU around M dwarfs.\n", "  We present a catalog of sources detected above 50 GeV by the {\\it\nFermi}-Large Area Telescope (LAT) in 80 months of data. The newly delivered\nPass 8 event-level analysis allows the detection and characterization of\nsources in the 50 GeV--2 TeV energy range. In this energy band, {\\it Fermi}-LAT\nhas detected 360 sources, which constitute the second catalog of hard {\\it\nFermi}-LAT sources (2FHL). The improved angular resolution enables the precise\nlocalization of point sources ($\\sim$1.7$'$ radius at 68 % C.~L.) and the\ndetection and characterization of spatially extended sources. We find that 86 %\nof the sources can be associated with counterparts at other wavelengths, of\nwhich the majority (75 %) are active galactic nuclei and the rest (11 %) are\nGalactic sources. Only 25 % of the 2FHL sources have been previously detected\nby Cherenkov telescopes, implying that the 2FHL provides a reservoir of\ncandidates to be followed up at very high energies. This work closes the energy\ngap between the observations performed at GeV energies by {\\it Fermi}-LAT on\norbit and the observations performed at higher energies by Cherenkov telescopes\nfrom the ground.\n", "  It attracts wide interest to seek universe saturable absorber covering\nwavelengths from near infrared to mid-infrared band. Multilayer black\nphosphorus, with variable direct bandgap (0.3-2 eV) depending on the layer\nnumber, becomes a good alternative as a universe saturable absorber for pulsed\nlasers. In this contribution, we first experimentally demonstrated broadband\nsaturable absorption of multilayer black phosphorus from 1 {\\mu}m to 2.7 {\\mu}m\nwavelength. With the as-fabricated black phosphorus nanoflakes as saturable\nabsorber, stable Q-switching operation of bulk lasers at 1.03 {\\mu}m, 1.93\n{\\mu}m, 2.72 {\\mu}m were realized, respectively. In contrast with large-bandgap\nsemiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides, such as MoS2, MoSe2,\nmultilayer black phosphorus shows particular advantage at the long wavelength\nregime thanks to its narrow direct bandgap. This work will open promising\noptoelectronic applications of black phosphorus in mid-infrared spectral region\nand further demonstrate that BP may fill the gap of between zero-bandgap\ngraphene and large-bandgap TMDs.\n", "  In this article we study the full one-loop SUSY contributions to the lepton\nflavor violating Higgs decay $h \\to \\tau \\bar \\mu $, within the context of the\nsupersymmetric inverse sesaw model. We assume that both the right-handed\nneutrino masses, $M_R$, and their supersymmetric partner masses, $m_{\\tilde\n\\nu_R}$, are not far from the interesting ${\\cal O}({\\rm TeV})$ energy scale,\nand we work with scenarios with large neutrino Yukawa couplings that transmit\nlarge lepton flavor violating effects. By exploring the behavior with the most\nrelevant parameters, mainly $M_R$, $m_{\\tilde \\nu_R}$ and the trilinear\nsneutrino coupling $A_\\nu$, we will look for regions of the parameter space\nwhere the enhancement of $\\mathrm{BR}(h\\rightarrow \\tau \\bar \\mu)$ is large\nenough to reach values at the percent level, which could explain the excess\nrecently reported by CMS and ATLAS at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.\n", "  Ultrathin Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ single crystals laid on Scotch tape are\ninvestigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy at $4$K and in a\nmagnetic field up to $35$T. The magneto-transmittance spectra of the Bi$_{2}$%\nTe$_{3}$/tape composite are analyzed as a two-layer system and the optical\nconductivity of Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ at different magnetic fields are extracted. We\nfind that magnetic field modifies the optical conductivity in the following\nways: (1) Field-induced transfer of the optical weight from the lower frequency\nregime ($<250$cm$^{-1}$) to the higher frequency regime ($% >250$cm$^{-1}$) due\nto the redistribution of charge carriers across the Fermi surface. (2) Evolving\nof a Fano-resonance-like spectral feature from an anti-resonance to a resonance\nwith increasing magnetic field. Such behavior can be attributed to the\nelectron-phonon interactions between the $% E_{u}^{1}$ optical phonon mode and\nthe continuum of electronic transitions. (3) Cyclotron resonance resulting from\nthe inter-valence band Landau level transitions, which can be described by the\nelectrodynamics of massive Dirac holes.\n", "  A non-abelian anyon can only occur in the presence of ground state degeneracy\nin the plane. It is conceivable that for some strange anyon with quantum\ndimension $>1$ that the resulting representations of all $n$-strand braid\ngroups $B_n$ are overall phases, even though the ground state manifolds for $n$\nsuch anyons in the plane are in general Hilbert spaces of dimensions $>1$. We\nobserve that degeneracy is all that is needed: for an anyon with quantum\ndimension $>1$ the non-abelian statistics cannot all be overall phases on the\ndegeneracy ground state manifold. Therefore, degeneracy implies non-abelian\nstatistics, which justifies defining a non-abelian anyon as one with quantum\ndimension $>1$. Since non-abelian statistics presumes degeneracy, degeneracy is\nmore fundamental than non-abelian statistics.\n", "  The spin transfer from vertically polarized beam protons to Lambda or Sigma\nhyperons of the associated strangeness production pp -> pK Lambda (Sigma) is\ndescribed with the depolarization coefficient D_NN. As the polarization of the\nhyperons is determined by their weak decays, detectors, which have a large\nacceptance for the decay particles, are needed. In this paper a formula is\nderived, which describes the depolarization coefficient D_NN by count rates of\na 4 pi detector. It is shown, that formulas, which are given in publications\nfor detectors with restricted acceptance, are specific cases of this formula\nfor a 4 pi detector.\n", "  The Farr-Bertillon law says that for all age-groups the death rate of married\npeople is lower than the death rate of people who are not married (i.e. single,\nwidowed or divorced). Although this law has been known for over 150 years, it\nhas never been established with great accuracy. This even let some authors\nargue that it was a statistical artefact. It is true that the data must be\nselected and analyzed with great care, especially for age groups of small size\nsuch as widowers under 25. The observations reported in this paper were\nselected and designed in the same way as experiments in physics, that is to say\nwith the objective of minimizing the error bars for all age-groups. It will be\nseen that data appropriate for mid-age groups may be unsuitable for young age\ngroups and vice versa. The investigation led to the following results. (1) The\nFB effect is basically the same for men and women, except that on average it is\nabout 20\\% stronger for men. (2) There is a marked difference between single or\ndivorced persons on the one hand, for whom the effect is largest around the age\nof 45, and widowed persons on the other hand, for whom the effect is largest\naround the age of 25. (3) When different causes of death are distinguished, the\neffect is largest for suicide and smallest for cancer. (4) For young widowers\nthe death rates are up to 10 times higher than for married persons of same age.\nThis extreme form of the FB effect will be referred to as the \"young widower\neffect.\" A possible connection between the FB effect and Martin Raff's \"Stay\nalive\" effect for cells in an organism is discussed in the last section.\n", "  We have studied by Molecular Dynamics computer simulations the dynamics of\nwater confined in ionic surfactants phases, ranging from well ordered lamellar\nstructures to micelles at low and high water loading, respectively. We have\nanalysed in depth the main dynamical features in terms of mean squared\ndisplacements and intermediate scattering functions, and found clear evidences\nof sub-diffusive behaviour. We have identified water molecules lying at the\ncharged interface with the hydrophobic confining matrix as the main responsible\nfor this unusual feature, and provided a comprehensive picture for dynamics\nbased on a very precise analysis of life times at the interface. We conclude by\nproviding, for the first time to our knowledge, a unique framework for\nrationalising the existence of important dynamical heterogeneities in fluids\nabsorbed in soft confining environments.\n", "  We examine what happens in a population when it experiences an abrupt change\nin surrounding conditions. Several cases of such \"abrupt transitions\" for both\nphysical and living social systems are analyzed from which it can be seen that\nall share a common pattern. First, a steep rising death rate followed by a much\nslower relaxation process during which the death rate decreases as a power law\n(with an exponent close to 0.7). This leads us to propose a general principle\nwhich can be summarized as follows: \"ANY abrupt change in living conditions\ngenerates a mortality spike which acts as a kind of selection process.\" This we\nterm the Transient Shock conjecture. It provides a qualitative model which\nleads to testable predictions. For example, marriage certainly brings about a\nmajor change in environmental and social conditions and according to our\nconjecture one would expect a mortality spike in the months following marriage.\nAt first sight this may seem an unlikely proposition but we demonstrate (by\nthree different methods) that even here the existence of mortality spikes is\nsupported by solid empirical evidence.\n", "  We experimentally perform open and closed-loop control of a separating\nturbulent boundary layer downstream from a sharp edge ramp. The turbulent\nboundary layer just above the separation point has a Reynolds number\n$Re_{\\theta}\\approx 3\\,500$ based on momentum thickness. The goal of the\ncontrol is to mitigate separation and early re-attachment. The forcing employs\na spanwise array of active vortex generators. The flow state is monitored with\nskin-friction sensors downstream of the actuators. The feedback control law is\nobtained using model-free genetic programming control (GPC) (Gautier et al.\n2015). The resulting flow is assessed using the momentum coefficient, pressure\ndistribution and skin friction over the ramp and stereo PIV. The PIV yields\nvector field statistics, e.g. shear layer growth, the backflow area and vortex\nregion. GPC is benchmarked against the best periodic forcing. While open-loop\ncontrol achieves separation reduction by locking-on the shedding mode, GPC\ngives rise to similar benefits by accelerating the shear layer growth.\nMoreover, GPC uses less actuation energy.\n", "  We study the magnetic and weak magnetic dipole moments of charged leptons in\nthe framework of the Two Higgs Doublet Model type III (THDM-III) with four zero\ntextures. We first analyze the possibility that the discrepancy between the\nexperimental measurements and the theoretical prediction of the muon anomalous\nmagnetic dipole moment ($a_{\\mu}$) in the Standard Model (SM) can be explained\nin the context of the model and then find values for the parameters of the\nTHDM-III: neutral and charged Higgs boson masses ($m_{H}$, $m_{H^{\\pm}}$),\nmixing angles ($\\alpha, {\\beta}$), CP-violating angles $\\theta_1,\\,\\theta_2$\nand an additional parameter arising from the mass matrix ($\\gamma_f$), for\nwhich a correspondence between theory and experiment is possible. We use\n$a_{\\mu}^{THDM-III}$ and current low energy processes $K-\\bar{K}$ mixing,\n$B_s^0\\to\\mu\\bar\\mu$, $\\tau\\to\\mu\\mu\\bar\\mu$, $\\mu\\to e e \\bar e$, $\\tau\\to\n\\mu\\gamma$, $\\tau\\to e\\gamma$, $\\mu\\to e \\gamma$, $b\\to s\\gamma$, $B\\to D (D^*)\n\\tau\\nu$ and the rare higgs decay $h\\to\\tau\\mu$ in order to determine the\nallowed parameter space of THDM-III and from these we give a prediction for the\nmagnetic and weak magnetic dipole moment of charged leptons, in particular of\nthe $\\tau$ lepton. The obtained magnetic dipole moment of the $\\tau$ lepton is\nof the order of $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-8}-10^{-7})$ and the weak magnetic is of the\norder $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-10}-10^{-7})$.\n", "  We construct the quantum BV master action for heterotic and type II string\nfield theories.\n", "  Phosphorene has been rediscovered recently, establishing itself as one of the\nmost promising two dimensional group-V elemental monolayers with direct band\ngap, high carrier mobility, and anisotropic electronic properties. In this\nletter, the buckling and its effect on the electronic properties in phosphorene\nare investigated by using molecular dynamics simulations and complemented by\ndensity functional theory calculations. We find that phosphorene shows superior\nout-of-plane structural flexibility along the armchair direction, which allows\nthe formation of buckling with large curvatures, while the buckling along the\nzigzag direction will break its structure integrity at large curvatures. The\nsemiconducting and direct band gap nature are retained with buckling along the\narmchair direction; the band gap decreases and transforms to an indirect band\ngap with buckling along the zigzag direction. The structural flexibility and\nelectronic robustness along the armchair direction facilitate the fabrication\nof devices with complex shapes, such as folded phosphorene and phosphorene\nnano-scrolls, thereby offering new possibilities for the application of\nphosphorene in flexible electronics and optoelectronics.\n", "  The di-neutron correlation is a spatial correlation with which two valence\nneutrons are located at a similar position inside a nucleus. We discuss\npossible experimental probes for the di-neutron correlation. This includes the\nCoulomb breakup and the pair transfer reactions of neutron-rich nuclei, and the\ndirect two-neutron decays of nuclei beyond the neutron drip-line.\n", "  Electroluminescence, the emission of light in the presence of an electric\ncurrent, provides information on the allowed electronic transitions of a given\nsystem. It is commonly used to investigate the physics of strongly-coupled\nlight-matter systems, whose eigenfrequencies are split by the strong coupling\nwith the photonic field of a cavity. Here we show that, together with the usual\nelectroluminescence, systems in the ultrastrong light-matter coupling regime\nemit a uniquely quantum radiation when a flow of current is driven through\nthem. While standard electroluminescence relies on the population of excited\nstates followed by spontaneous emission, the process we describe herein\nextracts bound photons by the dressed ground state and it has peculiar features\nthat unequivocally distinguish it from usual electroluminescence.\n", "  Two-nucleon systems are shown to exhibit large scattering lengths in strong\nmagnetic fields at unphysical quark masses, and the trends toward the physical\nvalues indicate that such features may exist in nature. Lattice QCD\ncalculations of the energies of one and two nucleons systems are performed at\npion masses of $m_\\pi\\sim 450$ and 806 MeV in uniform, time-independent\nmagnetic fields of strength {\\bf B}| \\sim 10^{19}$-$10^{20}$ Gauss to determine\nthe response of these hadronic systems to large magnetic fields. Fields of this\nstrength may exist inside magnetars and in peripheral relativistic heavy ion\ncollisions, and the unitary behavior at large scattering lengths may have\nimportant consequences for these systems.\n", "  We investigate the constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (cMSSM)\nin the light of constraining experimental and observational data from precision\nmeasurements, astrophysics, direct supersymmetry searches at the LHC and\nmeasurements of the properties of the Higgs boson, by means of a global fit\nusing the program Fittino. As in previous studies, we find rather poor\nagreement of the best fit point with the global data. We also investigate the\nstability of the electro-weak vacuum in the preferred region of parameter space\naround the best fit point. We find that the vacuum is metastable, with a\nlifetime significantly longer than the age of the Universe. For the first time\nin a global fit of supersymmetry, we employ a consistent methodology to\nevaluate the goodness-of-fit of the cMSSM in a frequentist approach by deriving\np-values from large sets of toy experiments. We analyse analytically and\nquantitatively the impact of the choice of the observable set on the p-value,\nand in particular its dilution when confronting the model with a large number\nof barely constraining measurements. Finally, for the preferred sets of\nobservables, we obtain p-values for the cMSSM below 10%, i.e. we exclude the\ncMSSM as a model at the 90% confidence level.\n", "  Spontaneous emission of radiation is one of the fundamental mechanisms by\nwhich an excited quantum system returns to equilibrium. For spins, however,\nspontaneous emission is generally negligible compared to other non-radiative\nrelaxation processes because of the weak coupling between the magnetic dipole\nand the electromagnetic field. In 1946, Purcell realized that the spontaneous\nemission rate can be strongly enhanced by placing the quantum system in a\nresonant cavity -an effect which has since been used extensively to control the\nlifetime of atoms and semiconducting heterostructures coupled to microwave or\noptical cavities, underpinning single-photon sources. Here we report the first\napplication of these ideas to spins in solids. By coupling donor spins in\nsilicon to a superconducting microwave cavity of high quality factor and small\nmode volume, we reach for the first time the regime where spontaneous emission\nconstitutes the dominant spin relaxation mechanism. The relaxation rate is\nincreased by three orders of magnitude when the spins are tuned to the cavity\nresonance, showing that energy relaxation can be engineered and controlled\non-demand. Our results provide a novel and general way to initialise spin\nsystems into their ground state, with applications in magnetic resonance and\nquantum information processing. They also demonstrate that, contrary to popular\nbelief, the coupling between the magnetic dipole of a spin and the\nelectromagnetic field can be enhanced up to the point where quantum\nfluctuations have a dramatic effect on the spin dynamics; as such our work\nrepresents an important step towards the coherent magnetic coupling of\nindividual spins to microwave photons.\n", "  The two-photon ${1s}^{2} 2s 2p~^3\\mbox{P}_0 \\rightarrow {1s}^{2} {2s}^2$\n$^1\\mbox{S}_0$ transition in berylliumlike ions is theoretically investigated\nwithin a full relativistic framework and a second-order perturbation theory. We\nfocus our analysis on how electron correlation, as well as the negative-energy\nspectrum can affect the forbidden $E1M1$ decay rate. For this purpose we\ninclude the electronic correlation by an effective potential and within an\nactive-electron model. Due to its experimental interest, evaluation of decay\nrates are performed for berylliumlike xenon and uranium. We find that the\nnegative-energy contribution can be neglected in the present decay rate. On the\nother hand, if contributions of electronic correlation are not carefully taken\ninto account, it may change the lifetime of the metastable state by 20\\%. By\nperforming a full-relativistic $jj$-coupling calculation, we found\ndiscrepancies for the decay rate of an order of 2 compared to non-relativistic\n$LS$-coupling calculations, for the selected heavy ions.\n", "  We study the thermal leptogenesis in the $E_6\\times U(1)_A$ SUSY GUT model in\nwhich realistic masses and mixings of quarks and leptons can be realized. We\nshow that the sufficient baryon number can be produced by the leptogenesis in\nthe model, in which the mass parameter of the lightest right-handed neutrino is\npredicted to be smaller than $10^8$ GeV. The essential point is that the mass\nof the lightest right-handed neutrino can be enhanced in the model because it\nhas a lot of mass terms whose mass parameters are predicted to be the same\norder of magnitude which is smaller than $10^8$ GeV. We show that O(10)\nenhancement for the lightest right-handed neutrino mass is sufficient for the\nobserved baryon asymmetry. Note that such mass enhancements do not change the\npredictions of neutrino masses and mixings at the low energy scale in the $E_6$\nmodel which has six right-handed neutrinos. In the calculation, we include the\neffects of supersymmetry and flavor in final states of the right-handed\nneutrino decay. We show that the effect of supersymmetry is quite important\neven in the strong washout regime when the effect of flavor is included. This\nis because the washout effects on the asymmetries both of the muon and the\nelectron become weaker than that of the tau asymmetry.\n", "  Based on our previous work for solving the nonlinear Schrodinger equation\nwith multichannel dynamics that is given by a localized standing wave and\nradiation, in this work we deal with the multichannel solution which consists\nof a moving soliton and radiation. We apply the modulation theory to give a\nsystem of ODEs coupled to the radiation term for describing the solution, which\nis valid for all times. The modulation equations are solved accurately by the\nproposed numerical method. The soliton and radiation are captured separately in\nthe computation, and they are solved on the translated domain that is moving\nwith them. Thus for a fixed finite physical domain in the lab frame, the\nmultichannel solution can pass through the boundary naturally, which can not be\ndone by imposing any existing boundary conditions. We comment on the\ndifferences of this method from the collective coordinates.\n", "  We consider Yang-Mills theory with $N{=}1$ super translation group in eleven\nauxiliary dimensions as the structure group. The gauge theory is defined on a\ndirect product manifold $\\Sigma_3\\times S^1$, where $\\Sigma_3$ is a\nthree-dimensional Lorentzian manifold and $S^1$ is a circle. We show that in\nthe infrared limit, when the metric on $S^1$ is scaled down, the Yang-Mills\naction supplemented by a Wess-Zumino-type term reduces to the action of an\nM2-brane.\n", "  The hard sphere repulsion among ions can be considered in the\nPoisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations by combining the fundamental measure\ntheory (FMT). To reduce the nonlocal computational complexity in 3D simulation\nof biological systems, a local approximation of FMT is derived, which forms a\nlocal hard sphere PNP (LHSPNP) model. It is interestingly found that the\nessential part of free energy term of the previous size modified model has a\nvery similar form to one term of the LHS model, but LHSPNP has more additional\nterms accounting for size effects. Equation of state for one component\nhomogeneous fluid is studied for the local hard sphere approximation of FMT and\nis proved to be exact for the first two virial coefficients, while the previous\nsize modified model only presents the first virial coefficient accurately. To\ninvestigate the effects of LHS model and the competitions among different\ncounterion species, numerical experiments are performed for the traditional PNP\nmodel, the LHSPNP model, the previous size modified PNP (SMPNP) model and the\nMonte Carlo simulation. It's observed that in steady state the LHSPNP results\nare quite different from the PNP results, but are close to the SMPNP results\nunder a wide range of boundary conditions. Besides, in both LHSPNP and SMPNP\nmodels the stratification of one counterion species can be observed under\ncertain bulk concentrations.\n", "  We present a detailed Fermi/LAT data analysis for the broad-line radio galaxy\n3C 120. This source has recently entered into a state of increased gamma-ray\nactivity which manifested itself in two major flares detected by Fermi/LAT in\nSeptember 2014 and April 2015 with no significant flux changes reported in\nother wavelengths. We analyse available data focusing our attention on\naforementioned outbursts. We find very fast variability timescale during flares\n(of the order of hours) together with a significant gamma-ray flux increase. We\nshow that the 6.8 years averaged gamma-ray emission of 3C 120 is likely a sum\nof the external radiation Compton and the synchrotron self-Compton radiative\ncomponents. To address the problem of \"orphan\" gamma-ray flares and fast\nvariability we model the jet radiation dividing the jet structure into two\ncomponents: the wide and relatively slow outer layer and the fast, narrow\nspine. We show that with the addition of the fast spine occasionally bent\ntowards the observer we are able to explain observed spectral energy\ndistribution of 3C 120 during flares with the Compton up-scattered broad-line\nregion and dusty torus photons as main gamma-rays emission mechanism.\n", "  In this paper we construct a CHY representation for all tree-level primitive\nQCD amplitudes. The quarks may be massless or massive. We define a generalised\ncyclic factor $\\hat{C}(w,z)$ and a generalised permutation invariant function\n$\\hat{E}(z,p,\\varepsilon)$. The amplitude is then given as a contour integral\nencircling the solutions of the scattering equations with the product $\\hat{C}\n\\hat{E}$ as integrand. Equivalently, it is given as a sum over the inequivalent\nsolutions of the scattering equations, where the summand consists of a Jacobian\ntimes the product $\\hat{C} \\hat{E}$. This representation separates information:\nThe generalised cyclic factor does not depend on the helicities of the external\nparticles, the generalised permutation invariant function does not depend on\nthe ordering of the external particles.\n", "  The Bondi-van der Burg-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group is the asymptotic symmetry\ngroup of asymptotically flat spacetime. It is infinite dimensional and entails\nan infinite number of conservation laws. According to the black hole membrane\nparadigm, null infinity (in asymptotically flat spacetime) and black hole event\nhorizons behave like fluid membranes. The fluid dynamics of the membrane is\ngoverned by an infinite set of symmetries and conservation laws. Our main\nresult is to point out that the infinite set of symmetries and conserved\ncharges of the BMS group and the membrane paradigm are the same. This\nrelationship has several consequences. First, it sheds light on the physical\ninterpretation of BMS conservation laws. Second, it generalizes the BMS\nconservation laws to arbitrary subregions of arbitrary null surfaces. Third, it\nclarifies the identification of the superrotation subgroup of the BMS group. We\nbriefly comment on the black hole information problem.\n", "  We consider the real topological string on certain non-compact toric\nCalabi-Yau three-folds X, in its physical realization describing an orientifold\nof type IIA on X with an O4-plane and a single D4-brane stuck on top. The\norientifold can be regarded as a new kind of surface operator on the gauge\ntheory with 8 supercharges arising from the singular geometry. We use the\nM-theory lift of this system to compute the real Gopakumar-Vafa invariants\n(describing wrapped M2-brane BPS states) for diverse geometries. We show that\nthe real topological string amplitudes pick up certain signs across flop\ntransitions, in a well-defined pattern consistent with continuity of the real\nBPS invariants. We further give some preliminary proposals of an intrinsically\ngauge theoretical description of the effect of the surface operator in the\ngauge theory partition function.\n", "  An inflationary universe scenario in the context of tachyon field is studied.\nThis study is done from an ansantz for the effective potential of cosmological\nperturbations $U(\\eta)$. We describe in great detail the analytical solutions\nof the scalar and tensor perturbations for two different ansantz in the\neffective potential of cosmological perturbations; the Easther's model and an\neffective potential similar to power law inflation. Also we find from the\nbackground equations that the effective tachyonic potential $V(\\varphi)$, in\nboth models satisfy the properties of a tachyonic potential. We consider the\nrecent data from the Planck data to constrain the parameters in our effective\npotential of cosmological perturbations.\n", "  We study the asymptotic behavior of the partition function and the\ncorrelation kernel in random matrix ensembles of the form $\\frac{1}{Z_n}\n\\big|\\det \\big( M^2-tI \\big)\\big|^{\\alpha} e^{-n\\operatorname{Tr} V(M)}dM$,\nwhere $M$ is an $n\\times n$ Hermitian matrix, $\\alpha>-1/2$ and $t\\in\\mathbb\nR$, in double scaling limits where $n\\to\\infty$ and simultaneously $t\\to 0$. If\n$t$ is proportional to $1/n^2$, a transition takes place which can be described\nin terms of a family of solutions to the Painlev\\'e V equation. These\nPainlev\\'e solutions are in general transcendental functions, but for certain\nvalues of $\\alpha$, they are algebraic, which leads to explicit asymptotics of\nthe partition function and the correlation kernel.\n", "  In this paper we investigate the qualitative behaviour of the pressure\nfunction beneath an extreme Stokes wave over infinite depth. The presence of a\nstagnation point at the wave-crest of an extreme Stokes wave introduces a\nnumber of mathematical difficulties resulting in the irregularity of the free\nsurface profile. It will be proven that the pressure decreases in the\nhorizontal direction between a crest-line and subsequent trough-line, except\nalong these lines themselves where the pressure is stationary with respect to\nthe horizontal coordinate. In addition we will prove that the pressure strictly\nincreases with depth throughout the fluid body.\n", "  The $H$-theorem, originally derived at the level of Boltzmann non-linear\nkinetic equation for a dilute gas undergoing elastic collisions, strongly\nconstrains the velocity distribution of the gas to evolve irreversibly towards\nequilibrium. As such, the theorem could not be generalized to account for\ndissipative systems: the conservative nature of collisions is an essential\ningredient in the standard derivation. For a dissipative gas of grains, we\nconstruct here a simple functional $\\mathcal H$ related to the original $H$,\nthat can be qualified as a Lyapunov functional. It is positive, and results\nbacked by three independent simulation approaches (a deterministic spectral\nmethod, the stochastic Direct Simulation Monte Carlo technique, and Molecular\nDynamics) indicate that it is also non-increasing. Both driven and unforced\ncases are investigated.\n", "  We study the collective excitations in a dissipative charged fluid at zero\nchemical potential when an external magnetic field is present. While in the\nabsence of magnetic field, four collective excitations appear in the fluid, we\nfind five hydrodynamic modes in presence of magnetic field. This implies that\nthe magnetic field splits the degeneracy between the transverse shear modes.\nUsing linear response theory, we then compute the retarded response functions.\nIn particular, it turns out that the correlation between charge and the energy\nfluctuations will no longer vanish, even at zero chemical potential. By use of\nthe response functions, we also derive the relevant Kubo formulas for the\ntransport coefficients.\n", "  Limits on gravitational Cherenkov radiation by cosmic rays are obtained and\nused to constrain coefficients for Lorentz violation in the gravity sector\nassociated with operators of even mass dimensions, including\norientation-dependent effects. We use existing data from cosmic-ray telescopes\nto obtain conservative two-sided constraints on 80 distinct Lorentz-violating\noperators of dimensions four, six, and eight, along with conservative one-sided\nconstraints on three others. Existing limits on the nine minimal operators at\ndimension four are improved by factors of up to a billion, while 74 of our\nexplicit limits represent stringent first constraints on nonminimal operators.\nProspects are discussed for future analyses incorporating effects of Lorentz\nviolation in the matter sector, the role of gravitational Cherenkov radiation\nby high-energy photons, data from gravitational-wave observatories, the\ntired-light effect, and electromagnetic Cherenkov radiation by gravitons.\n", "  Recent work has provided the means to rigorously determine properties of\nsuper-hadronic matter from experimental data through the application of broad\nscale modeling of high-energy nuclear collisions within a Bayesian framework.\nThese studies have provided unprecedented statistical inferences about the\nphysics underlying nuclear collisions by virtue of simultaneously considering a\nwide range of model parameters and experimental observables. Notably, this\napproach has been used to constrain both the QCD equation of state and the\nshear viscosity above the quark-hadron transition. Although the inferences\nthemselves have a clear meaning, the complex nature of the relationships\nbetween model parameters and observables have remained relatively obscure. We\npresent here a novel extension of the standard Bayesian Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo approach that allows for the quantitative determination of how inferences\nof model parameters are driven by experimental measurements and their\nuncertainties. This technique is then applied in the context of heavy ion\ncollisions in order to explore previous results in greater depth. The resulting\nrelationships are useful for identifying model weaknesses, prioritizing future\nexperimental measurements, and most importantly: developing an intuition for\nthe role that different observables play in constraining our understanding of\nthe underlying physics.\n", "  To understand the collinear-magnetism-driven ferroelectricity in multiferroic\nCa3CoMnO6 compound, we have established an elastic diatomic Ising spin-chain\nmodel with axial-next-nearest-neighbor interaction to describe its\nmagnetoelectric properties. By employing magneto-phonon decoupling and\ntransfer-matrix method, the possible ground-state configurations and\nthermodynamic behaviors of the system have been exactly determined. From the\nperspective of the ground-state configuration, we analyze the computational\nresults and make a detail comparison with experimental data. The parameter\nrelation for the appearance of electric polarization has been discussed. Our\ndata indicate that the magnetic coupling between nearest-neighbor spin pair is\nantiferromagnetic rather than ferromagnetic. The system under the driven of\nexternal magnetic field undergoes a different series of transitions from the\nup-up-down-down spin configuration to the up-down-up state with peculiar 1/3\nmagnetization plateau, then to the up-up-up-down state, and finally saturated\nat up-up-up-up state.\n", "  We show that a cosmology driven by gravitationally induced particle\nproduction of all non-relativistic species existing in the present Universe\nmimics exactly the observed flat accelerating $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology with just\none dynamical free parameter. This kind of scenario includes the creation cold\ndark matter (CCDM) model [Lima, Jesus & Oliveira, JCAP 011(2010)027] as a\nparticular case and also provides a natural reduction of the dark sector since\nthe vacuum component is not needed to accelerate the Universe. The new cosmic\nscenario is equivalent to $\\Lambda$CDM both at the background and perturbative\nlevels and the associated creation process is also in agreement with the\nuniversality of the gravitational interaction and equivalence principle.\nImplicitly, it also suggests that the present day astronomical observations\ncannot be considered the ultimate proof of cosmic vacuum effects in the evolved\nUniverse because $\\Lambda$CDM may be only an effective cosmology.\n", "  Studying single-particle dynamics over many periods of oscillations is a\nwell-understood problem solved using symplectic integration. Such integration\nschemes derive their update sequence from an approximate Hamiltonian,\nguaranteeing that the geometric structure of the underlying problem is\npreserved. Simulating a self-consistent system over many oscillations can\nintroduce numerical artifacts such as grid heating. This unphysical heating\nstems from using non-symplectic methods on Hamiltonian systems. With this\nguidance, we derive an electrostatic algorithm using a discrete form of\nHamilton's Principle. The resulting algorithm, a gridless spectral\nelectrostatic macroparticle model, does not exhibit the unphysical heating\ntypical of most particle-in-cell methods. We present results of this using a\ntwo-body problem as an example of the algorithm's energy- and\nmomentum-conserving properties.\n", "  The electronic structure of FeSe thin films grown on SrTiO3 substrate is\nstudied by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We reveal the\nexistence of Dirac cone band dispersions in FeSe thin films thicker than 1 Unit\nCell below the nematic transition temperature, whose apex are located -10 meV\nbelow Fermi energy. The evolution of Dirac cone electronic structure for FeSe\nthin films as function of temperature, thickness and cobalt doping is\nsystematically studied. The Dirac cones are found to be coexisted with the\nnematicity in FeSe, disappear when nematicity is suppressed. Our results\nprovide some indication that the spin degrees of freedom may play some kind of\nrole in the nematicity of FeSe.\n", "  By using a recently obtained set of Lambda fracture functions, we present\npredictions for Lambda production in the target fragmentation region of\nSemi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering in CLAS@12 GeV kinematics,\nsupplemented with a conservative error estimates. We discuss a number of\nobservables sensitive to the assumptions of the underlying theory and many of\nthe assumptions of the proposed phenomenological model.\n", "  Quantum memory is an essential building block for quantum communication and\nscalable linear quantum computation. Storing two color entangled photons, with\none photon being at telecom-wavelength while the other photon being compatible\nof quantum memory, has great advantages toward the realization of the fiber\nbased long-distance quantum communication with the aid of quantum repeaters.\nHere, we report an experimental realization of storing a photon entangled with\na telecom photon in polarization as an atomic spin wave in a cold atomic\nensemble, thus establishing the entanglement between the telecom-band photon\nand the atomic ensemble memory in polarization degree of freedom. The\nreconstructed density matrix and the violation of Clauser Horne Shimony Holt\ninequality clearly show the preservation of quantum entanglement during\nstorage. Our result is very promising for establishing a long-distance quantum\nnetwork based on cold atomic ensembles.\n", "  Tin (II) sulfide (SnS) is a layered mineral found in nature. In this paper,\nwe study the two-dimensional form of this material using a combination of\n\\emph{ab initio} calculation and $\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}$ theory. In\nparticular, we address the valley properties and the optical selection rules of\n2D SnS. Our study reveals SnS as an extraordinary material for valleytronics,\nwhere pairs of equivalent valleys are placed along two perpendicular axes, can\nbe selected exclusively with linear polarized light, and can be separated using\nnon-local electrical measurements.\n", "  We consider a body immersed in a perfect gas, moving under the action of a\nconstant force E along the x axis . We assume the gas to be described by the\nmean-field approximation and interacting elastically with the body, we study\nthe friction exerted by the gas on the body fixed at constant velocities. The\ndynamic in this setting was studied in previous papers for object with simple\nshape, showing new features in the dynamic but not in the friction term. The\ncase of more general shape of the body was left out for further difficulties,\nwe believe indeed that there are actually non trivial issues to be faced for\nthese more general cases. To show this and in the in the spirit of getting a\nmore realistic perspective in the study of friction problems, in this paper we\nfocused our attention on the friction term itself, studying its behavior on a\nbody with a more general kind of concavity and fixed at constant velocities. We\nderive the expression of the friction term for constant velocities, we show how\nit is time dependent and we give its exact estimate in time. Finally we use\nthis result to show the absence of a stationary velocity in the actual dynamic\nof such a body.\n", "  We study the Thermo-field realization of the duality between the Rindler-AdS\nhigher spin theory and $O(N)$ vector theory. The CFT represents a decoupled\npair of free $O(N)$ vector field theories. It is shown how this decoupled\ndomain CFT is capable of generating the connected Rindler-AdS background with\nthe full set of Higher Spin fields.\n", "  We consider the recently proposed cosmological relaxation mechanism where the\nhierarchy problem is ameliorated, and the electroweak scale is dynamically\nselected by a slowly rolling axion field. We argue that, in its simplest form,\nthe construction breaks a gauge symmetry that always exists for\npseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons (in particular the axion). The small parameter in\nthe relaxion model is therefore not technically natural as it breaks a gauge\nsymmetry rather than global symmetries only. The consistency of the theory\ngenerically implies that the cutoff must lie around the electroweak scale, but\nnot qualitatively higher. We discuss several ways to evade the above\nconclusion. Some of them may be sufficient to increase the cutoff to the\nfew-TeV range (and therefore may be relevant for the little-hierarchy problem).\nTo demonstrate the ideas in a concrete setting we consider a model with a\nfamilon, the Nambu-Goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken chiral flavor\nsymmetry. The model has some interesting collider-physics aspects and contains\na viable weakly interacting dark matter candidate.\n", "  Since Dicke's seminal paper on coherence in spontaneous radiation by atomic\nensembles, superradiance has been extensively studied. Subradiance, on the\ncontrary, has remained elusive, mainly because subradiant states are weakly\ncoupled to the environment and are very sensitive to nonradiative decoherence\nprocesses.Here we report the experimental observation of subradiance in an\nextended and dilute cold-atom sample containing a large number of particles. We\nuse a far detuned laser to avoid multiple scattering and observe the temporal\ndecay after a sudden switch-off of the laser beam. After the fast decay of most\nof the fluorescence, we detect a very slow decay, with time constants as long\nas 100 times the natural lifetime of the excited state of individual atoms.\nThis subradiant time constant scales linearly with the cooperativity parameter,\ncorresponding to the on-resonance optical depth of the sample, and is\nindependent of the laser detuning, as expected from a coupled-dipole model.\n", "  We study a singlet-triplet Josephson junction between a conventional s-wave\nsuperconductor and an unconventional p$_{\\rm x}$-wave superconductor. The\nAndreev spectrum of the junction yields a spontaneous magnetization in\nequilibrium. This allows manipulating the occupation of the Andreev levels\nusing an ac Zeeman field. The induced Rabi oscillations manifest themselves as\na resonance in the current-phase relation. For a circularly polarized magnetic\nfield, we find a spin selection rule, yielding Rabi oscillations only in a\ncertain interval of the superconducting phase difference.\n", "  We study the Thiele equation for current-induced motion in a skyrmion lattice\nthrough two soluble models of the pinning potential. Comprised by a Magnus\nterm, a dissipative term and a pinning force, Thiele's equation resembles\nNewton's law but in virtue of the topological character of the first two, it\ndiffers significantly from Newtonian mechanics and because the Magnus force is\ndominant, unlike its mechanical counterpart, the Coriolis force, skyrmion\ntrajectories do not necessarily have mechanical counterparts. This is important\nif we are to understand skykrmion dynamics and tap into its potential for\ndata-storage technology. We identify a pinning threshold velocity for the\none-dimensional potential and for a two-dimensional potential we find a pinning\npoint and the skyrmion trajectories toward the point are spirals whose\nfrequency (compare Kepler's second law) and amplitude decay depends only on the\nGilbert constant and potential at the pinning point.\n", "  In the framework of a phase field model of a single cell crawling on a\nsubstrate, we investigate how the properties of the cell membrane affect the\nshape and motility of the cell. Since the membrane influences the cell dynamics\non multiple levels and provides a nontrivial feedback, we consider the\nfollowing fundamental interactions: (i) the reduction of the actin\npolymerization rate by membrane tension; (ii) area conservation of the cell's\ntwo-dimensional cross-section vs. conservation of its circumference (i.e.\nmembrane inextensibility); and (iii) the contribution from the membrane's\nbending energy to the shape and integrity of the cell. As in experiments, we\ninvestigate two pertinent observables -- the cell's velocity and its aspect\nratio. We find that the most important effect is the feedback of membrane\ntension on the actin polymerization. Bending rigidity has only minor effects,\nvisible mostly in dynamic reshaping events, as exemplified by collisions of the\ncell with an obstacle.\n", "  In this work we investigate generalized theories of gravity in the so-called\nconfigurational entropy (CE) context. We show, by means of this\ninformation-theoretical measure, that a stricter bound on the parameter of\n$f(R,T)$ brane models arises from the CE. We find that these bounds are\ncharacterized by a valley region in the CE profile, where the entropy is\nminimal. We argue that the CE measure can open a new role and an important\nadditional approach to select parameters in modified theories of gravitation.\n", "  In this paper, we analyze the holographic principle using loop quantum\ngravity (LQG). This will be done by using polymeric quantization for analysing\nthe Yurtsever's holographic bound on the entropy, which is obtained from local\nquantum field theories. As the polymeric quantization is the characteristic\nfeature of loop quantum gravity, we will argue that this calculation will\nindicate the effect of loop quantum gravity on the holographic principle. Thus,\nwe will be able to explicitly demonstrate the violation of the holographic\nprinciple in the loop quantum gravity.\n", "  Experimental measurements and numerical simulations are made on fluid flow\nthrough cross-slot devices with a range of aspect (depth:width) ratios, 0.4 <\nalpha < 3.87. For low Reynolds numbers Re, the flow is symmetric and a sharp\nboundary exists between fluid streams entering the cross-slot from opposite\ndirections. Above an alpha-dependent critical value Re_c, the flow undergoes a\nsymmetry-breaking bifurcation (though remains steady and laminar) and a spiral\nvortex structure develops about the central axis of the outflow channel. An\norder parameter characterizing the instability grows according to a sixth-order\nLandau potential, and shows a progression from second order to first order\ntransitions as alpha increases. A tricritical point occurs for alpha ~ 0.55.\nThe spiral vortex acts as a mixing region in the flow field and this phenomenon\ncan be used to drive enhanced mixing in microfluidic devices.\n", "  String theory proves to be an imperative tool to explore the critical\nbehavior of the quantum dissipative system. We discuss the quantum particles\nmoving in two dimensions, in the presence of a uniform magnetic field, subject\nto a periodic potential and a dissipative force, which are described by the\ndissipative Wannier-Azbel-Hofstadter (DWAH) model. Using string theory\nformulation of the model, we find that the elementary excitations of the system\nat the generic points of the off-critical regions, in the zero temperature\nlimit are quons, which satisfy q-deformed statistics.\n", "  We study the existence and properties of the non-equilibrium steady state\nwhich arises by putting two copies of systems at different temperatures into a\nthermal contact. We solve the problem for the relativistic systems that are\ndescribed by the energy-momentum of a perfect hydro with general equation of\nstate (EOS). In particular, we examine several simple examples: a hydro with a\nlinear EOS, a holographic CFT perturbed by a relevant operator and a barotropic\nfluid, i.e., P = P(E). Our studies suggest that the formation of steady state\nis a universal result of the hydro regime regardless of the kind of fluid.\n", "  We study the role of the Hall current and electron inertia in collisionless\nmagnetic reconnection within the framework of full two-fluid MHD. At spatial\nscales smaller than the electron inertial length, a topological change of\nmagnetic field lines exclusively due to electron inertia becomes possible.\nAssuming stationary conditions, we derive a theoretical scaling for the\nreconnection rate, which is simply proportional to the Hall parameter. Using a\npseudo-spectral code with no dissipative effects, our numerical results confirm\nthis theoretical scaling. In particular, for a sequence of different Hall\nparameter values, our numerical results show that the width of the current\nsheet is independent of the Hall parameter while its thickness is of the order\nof the electron inertial range, thus confirming that the stationary\nreconnection rate is proportional to the Hall parameter.\n", "  We show how to perform universal Hamiltonian and adiabatic computing using a\ntime-independent Hamiltonian on a 2D grid describing a system of hopping\nparticles which string together and interact to perform the computation. In\nthis construction, the movement of one particle is controlled by the presence\nor absence of other particles, an effective quantum field effect transistor\nthat allows the construction of controlled-NOT and controlled-rotation gates.\nThe construction translates into a model for universal quantum computation with\ntime-independent 2-qubit ZZ and XX+YY interactions on an (almost) planar grid.\nThe effective Hamiltonian is arrived at by a single use of first-order\nperturbation theory avoiding the use of perturbation gadgets. The dynamics and\nspectral properties of the effective Hamiltonian can be fully determined as it\ncorresponds to a particular realization of a mapping between a quantum circuit\nand a Hamiltonian called the space-time circuit-to-Hamiltonian construction.\nBecause of the simple interactions required, and because no higher-order\nperturbation gadgets are employed, our construction is potentially realizable\nusing superconducting or other solid-state qubits.\n", "  We present domain decomposition finite element/finite difference method for\nthe solution of hyperbolic equation. The domain decomposition is performed such\nthat finite elements and finite differences are used in different subdomains of\nthe computational domain: finite difference method is used on the structured\npart of the computational domain and finite elements on the unstructured part\nof the domain. The main goal of this method is to combine flexibility of finite\nelement method and efficiency of a finite difference method.\n  An explicit discretization schemes for both methods are constructed such that\nfinite element and finite difference schemes coincide on the common structured\noverlapping layer between computational subdomains. Then the resulting scheme\ncan be considered as a pure finite element scheme which allows avoid\ninstabilities at the interfaces.\n  We illustrate efficiency of the domain decomposition method on the\nreconstruction of the conductivity function in the hyperbolic equation in three\ndimensions.\n", "  This paper investigates the decays from heavy higgsino-like weak-doublets\ninto Z, h bosons and missing particles. When pair-produced at the LHC, the\nsubsequent Z, h to 2l, 2b decays in the doublet decay cascade can yield 4l, 2l\n2b, and 4b + MET + jets final states. Mutual observation of any two of these\nchannels would provide information on the the associated doublets' decay\nbranching fractions into a Z or h, thereby probing the Goldstone equivalence\nrelation, shedding additional light on the Higgs sector of beyond the Standard\nModel theories, and facilitating the discrimination of various contending\nmodels, in turn. We compare the Z/h decay ratio expected in the Minimal\nSupersymmetric model, the Next-to Minimal Supersymmetric model and a minimal\nsinglet-doublet dark matter model. Additionally, we conduct a full Monte Carlo\nanalysis of the prospects for detecting the targeted final states during 14 TeV\nrunning of the LHC in the context of a representative NMSSM benchmark model.\n", "  In this paper, we study the blowup phenomena for the regular solutions of the\nisentropic relativistic Euler-Poisson equations with a vacuum state in\nspherical symmetry. Using a general family of testing functions, we obtain new\nblowup conditions for the relativistic Euler-Poisson equations. We also show\nthat the proposed blowup conditions are valid regardless of the speed\nrequirement, which was one of the key constraints stated in \"Y. Geng,\nSingularity Formation for Relativistic Euler and Euler-Poisson Equations with\nRepulsive Force, Commun. Pure Appl. Anal., 14 (2015), 549--564.\".\n", "  In order to calculate QED corrections to hadronic physical quantities by\nmeans of lattice simulations, a coherent description of electrically-charged\nstates in finite volume is needed. In the usual periodic setup, Gauss's law and\nlarge gauge transformations forbid the propagation of electrically-charged\nstates. A possible solution to this problem, which does not violate the axioms\nof local quantum field theory, has been proposed by Wiese and Polley, and is\nbased on the use of C* boundary conditions. We present a thorough analysis of\nthe properties and symmetries of QED in isolation and QED coupled to QCD, with\nC* boundary conditions. In particular we learn that a certain class of\nelectrically-charged states can be constructed in this setup in a fully\nconsistent fashion, without relying on gauge fixing. We argue that this class\nof states covers most of the interesting phenomenological applications in the\nframework of numerical simulations. We also calculate finite-volume corrections\nto the mass of stable charged particles and show that these are much smaller\nthan in non-local formulations of QED.\n", "  Street networks are important infrastructural transportation systems that\ncover a great part of the planet. It is now widely accepted that transportation\nproperties of street networks are better understood in the interplay between\nthe street network itself and the so called \\textit{information} or\n\\textit{dual network}, which embeds the topology of the street network\nnavigation system. In this work, we present a novel robustness analysis, based\non the interaction between the primal and the dual transportation layer for two\nlarge metropolis, London and Chicago, thus considering the structural\ndifferences to intentional attacks for \\textit{self-organized} and planned\ncities. We elaborate the results through an accurate closeness centrality\nanalysis in the Euclidean space and in the relationship between primal and dual\nspace. Interestingly enough, we find that even if the considered planar graphs\ndisplay very distinct properties, the information space induce them to converge\ntoward systems which are similar in terms of transportation properties.\n", "  We studied formation of vortex with four-fold symmetry in a minimal model of\nself-propelled particles, confined inside a squared box, using computer\nsimulations and also theoretical analysis. In addition to the vortex pattern,\nwe observed five other phases in the system: homogeneous gaseous phase, band\nstructures, moving clumps, moving clusters and vibrating rings. All six phases\nemerge from controlling strength of noise and contribution of repulsion and\nalignment interactions. We studied shape of the vortex and its symmetry in\ndetail. The pattern shows exponential defect lines where incoming and outgoing\nflows of particles collide. We show that alignment and repulsion interactions\nbetween particles are necessary to form such patterns. Finally, we derived\nhydro-dynamical equations for our model and compared them with the results of\nboth computer simulations and Quincke rotors. A good agreement between the\nthree is observed.\n", "  We present several arguments which favor the scenario of two coexisting\nfamilies of compact stars: hadronic stars and quark stars. Besides the well\nknown hyperon puzzle of the physics of compact stars, a similar puzzle exists\nalso when considering delta resonances. We show that these particles appear at\ndensities close to twice saturation density and must be therefore included in\nthe calculations of the hadronic equation of state. Such an early appearance is\nstrictly related to the value of the L parameter of the symmetry energy that\nhas been found, in recent phenomenological studies, to lie in the range\n$40<L<62$ MeV. We discuss also the threshold for the formation of deltas and\nhyperons for hot and lepton rich hadronic matter. Similarly to the case of\nhyperons, also delta resonances cause a softening of the equation of state\nwhich makes it difficult to obtain massive hadronic stars. Quark stars, on the\nother hand, can reach masses up to $2.75 M_{\\odot}$ as predicted by\nperturbative QCD calculations. We then discuss the observational constraints on\nthe masses and the radii of compact stars. The tension between the precise\nmeasurements of high masses and the indications of the existence of very\ncompact stellar objects (with radii of the order of $10$ km) is relieved when\nassuming that very massive compact stars are quark stars and very compact stars\nare hadronic stars. Finally, we discuss recent interesting measurements of the\neccentricities of the orbits of millisecond pulsars in low mass X-ray binaries.\nThe high values of the eccentricities found in some cases could be explained by\nassuming that the hadronic star, initially present in the binary system,\nconverts to a quark star due to the increase of its central density.\n", "  We will follow the two-families scenario described in the accompanying paper,\nin which compact stars having a very small radius and masses not exceeding\nabout 1.5$M_\\odot$ are made of hadrons, while more massive compact stars are\nquark stars. In the present paper we discuss the dynamics of the transition of\na hadronic star into a quark star. We will show that the transition takes place\nin two phases: a very rapid one, lasting a few milliseconds, during which the\ncentral region of the star converts into quark matter and the process of\nconversion is accelerated by the existence of strong hydrodynamical\ninstabilities, and a second phase, lasting about ten seconds, during which the\nprocess of conversion proceeds till the surface of the star via production and\ndiffusion of strangeness. We will show that these two steps play a crucial role\nin the phenomenological implications of the model. We will discuss the possible\nimplications of this scenario both for long and for short Gamma Ray Bursts,\nusing the proto-magnetar model as the reference frame of our discussion. We\nwill show that the process of quark deconfinement can be connected to specific\nobserved features of the GRBs. In the case of long GRBs we will discuss the\npossibility that quark deconfinement is at the origin of the second peak\npresent in quite a large fraction of bursts. Also we will discuss the\npossibility that long GRBs can take place in binary systems without being\nassociated with a SN explosion. Concerning short GRBs, quark deconfinement can\nplay the crucial role in limiting their duration. Finally we will shortly\nrevisit the possible relevance of quark deconfinement in some specific type of\nSupernova explosions, in particular in the case of very massive progenitors.\n", "  We analysed 385 galactic spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data\nRelease 7 (SDSS-DR7) that belong to the catalog of isolated pairs of galaxies\nby Karachentsev. The spectra corresponds to physical pairs of galaxies as\ndefined by V $\\leq$ 1200 Km/s and a pair separation $\\leq$ 100 kpc. We search\nfor the incidence of nuclear activity, both thermal (star-forming) and\nnon-thermal -Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). After a careful extraction of the\nnuclear spectra, we use diagnostic diagrams and find that the incidence of AGN\nactivity is 48 \\% in the paired galaxies with emission lines and 40\\% for the\ntotal sample (as compared to $\\sim$ 43 \\% and 41\\% respectively in a sample of\nisolated galaxies). These results remain after dissecting the effects of\nmorphological type and galactic stellar mass (with only a small, non\nsignificant, enhancement of the AGN fraction in pairs of objects). These\nresults suggest that weak interactions are not necessary or sufficient to\ntrigger low-luminosity AGN. Since the fraction of AGN is predominant in early\ntype spiral galaxies, we conclude that the role of a bulge, and a large gas\nreservoir are both essential for the triggering of nuclear activity. The most\nstriking result is that type 1 galaxies are almost absent from the AGN sample.\nThis result is in conflict with the Unified Model, and suggests that high\naccretion rates are essential to form the Broad Line Region in active galaxies.\n", "  Motivated by a recent work on asymptotically AdS_4 black holes in M-theory,\nwe investigate the thermodynamics and thermodynamical geometry of AdS black\nholes from M2 and M5-branes. Concretely, we consider AdS black holes in\nAdS_{p+2}\\times S^{11-p-2}, where p=2,5 by interpreting the number of M2 (and\nM5-branes) as a thermodynamical variable. We study the corresponding phase\ntransition to examine their stabilities by calculating and discussing various\nthermodynamical quantities including the chemical potential. Then, we compute\nthe thermodynamical curvatures from the Quevedo metric for M2 and M5-branes\ngeometries to reconsider the stability of such black objects. The Quevedo\nmetric singularities recover similar stability results provided by the phase\ntransition program.\n", "  We present a theory in three parts, of the secular dynamics of a (Keplerian)\nstellar system of mass $M$ orbiting a black hole of mass $M_\\bullet \\gg M$.\nHere we describe the collisionless dynamics; Papers II and III are on the\n(collisional) theory of Resonant Relaxation. The mass ratio, $\\varepsilon =\nM/M_\\bullet \\ll 1$, is a natural small parameter implying a separation of time\nscales between the short Kepler orbital periods and the longer orbital\nprecessional periods. The collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE) for the\nstellar distribution function (DF) is averaged over the fast Kepler orbital\nphase using the method of multiple scales. The orbit-averaged system is\ndescribed by a secular DF, $F$, in a reduced phase space. $F$ obeys a secular\nCBE that includes stellar self-gravity, general relativistic corrections up to\n1.5 post-Newtonian order, and external sources varying over secular times.\nSecular dynamics, even with general time dependence, conserves the semi-major\naxis of every star. This additional integral of motion promotes extra\nregularity of the stellar orbits, and enables the construction of equilibria,\n$F_0$, through a secular Jeans theorem. A linearized secular CBE determines the\nresponse and stability of $F_0$. Spherical, non-rotating equilibria may support\nlong-lived, warp-like distortions. We also prove that an axisymmetric,\nzero-thickness, flat disc is secularly stable to all in-plane perturbations,\nwhen its DF, $F_0$, is a monotonic function of the angular momentum at fixed\nenergy.\n", "  We present a first-principles theory of Resonant Relaxation (RR) of a low\nmass stellar system orbiting a more massive black hole (MBH). We first extend\nthe kinetic theory of Gilbert (1968) to include the Keplerian field of a black\nhole of mass $M_\\bullet$. Specializing to a Keplerian stellar system of mass $M\n\\ll M_\\bullet$, we use the orbit-averaging method of Sridhar & Touma (2015;\nPaper I) to derive a kinetic equation for RR. This describes the collisional\nevolution of a system of $N \\gg 1$ Gaussian Rings in a reduced 5-dim space,\nunder the combined actions of self-gravity, 1 PN and 1.5 PN relativistic\neffects of the MBH and an arbitrary external potential. In general geometries\nRR is driven by both apsidal and nodal resonances, so the distinction between\nscalar-RR and vector-RR disappears. The system passes through a sequence of\nquasi-steady secular collisionless equilibria, driven by irreversible 2-Ring\ncorrelations that accrue through gravitational interactions, both direct and\ncollective. This correlation function is related to a `wake function', which is\nthe linear response of the system to the perturbation of a chosen Ring. The\nwake function is easier to appreciate, and satisfies a simpler equation, than\nthe correlation function. We discuss general implications for the interplay of\nsecular dynamics and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics in the evolution of\nKeplerian stellar systems toward secular thermodynamic equilibria, and set the\nstage for applications to the RR of axisymmetric discs in Paper III.\n", "  Spacetime with general linear vector distortion is introduced. Thus, the\ntorsion and the nonmetricity of the affine connection are assumed to be\nproportional to a vector field (and not its derivatives). The resulting\ntwo-parameter family of non-Riemannian geometries generalises the conformal\nWeyl geometry and some other interesting special cases. Taking into account the\nleading order quadratic curvature correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action\nresults uniquely in the one-parameter extension of the Starobinsky inflation\nknown as the alpha-attractor. The most general quadratic curvature action\nintroduces, in addition to the canonical vector kinetic term, novel ghost-free\nvector-tensor interactions.\n", "  We study the thermal conductivity of the disordered two-dimensional electron\ngas. To this end we analyze the heat density-heat density correlation function\nconcentrating on the scattering processes induced by the Coulomb interaction in\nthe sub-temperature energy range. These scattering processes are at the origin\nof logarithmic corrections violating the Wiedemann-Franz law. Special care is\ndevoted to the definition of the heat density in the presence of the long-range\nCoulomb interaction. To clarify the structure of the correlation function, we\npresent details of a perturbative calculation. While the conservation of energy\nstrongly constrains the general form of the heat density-heat density\ncorrelation function, the balance of various terms turns out to be rather\ndifferent from that for the correlation functions of other conserved quantities\nsuch as the density-density or spin density-spin density correlation function.\n", "  We report the experimental observation of two-mode squeezing in the\noscillation quadratures of a thermal micro-oscillator. This effect is obtained\nby parametric modulation of the optical spring in a cavity opto-mechanical\nsystem. In addition to stationary variance measurements, we describe the\ndynamic behavior in the regime of pulsed parametric excitation, showing\nenhanced squeezing effect surpassing the stationary 3dB limit. While the\npresent experiment is in the classical regime, our technique can be exploited\nto produce entangled, macroscopic quantum opto-mechanical modes.\n", "  We study all possible neutrino mass matrices with one zero element and two\nequal non-zero elements, known as hybrid texture neutrino mass matrices. In the\ndiagonal charged lepton basis, we consider thirty nine such possible cases\nwhich are consistent with the latest neutrino data. Using the two constraints\non neutrino mass matrix elements imposed by hybrid textures, we numerically\nevaluate the neutrino parameters like the lightest neutrino mass\n$m_{\\text{lightest}}$, one Dirac CP phase $\\delta$ and two Majorana CP phases\n$\\alpha, \\beta$ by using the global fit $3\\sigma$ values of three mixing angles\nand two mass squared differences. We then constrain this parameter space by\nusing the cosmological upper bound on the sum of absolute neutrino masses given\nby Planck experiment. We also calculate the effective neutrino mass matrix for\nthis region of parameter space which may have relevance in future neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay experiments. We finally discriminate between these hybrid\ntexture mass matrices from the requirement of producing correct baryon\nasymmetry through type I seesaw leptogenesis. We also constrain the light\nneutrino parameter space as well as the lightest right handed neutrino mass\nfrom the constraint on baryon asymmetry of the Universe from Planck experiment.\n", "  We apply second order finite difference to calculate the lowest eigenvalues\nof the Helmholtz equation, for complicated non-tensor domains in the plane,\nusing different grids which sample exactly the border of the domain. We show\nthat the results obtained applying Richardson and Pad\\'e-Richardson\nextrapolation to a set of finite difference eigenvalues corresponding to\ndifferent grids allows to obtain extremely precise values. When possible we\nhave assessed the precision of our extrapolations comparing them with the\nhighly precise results obtained using the method of particular solutions. Our\nempirical findings suggest an asymptotic nature of the FD series. In all the\ncases studied, we are able to report numerical results which are more precise\nthan those available in the literature.\n", "  A future e+e- collider, such as the ILC or CLIC, would allow the Higgs sector\nto be probed with a precision significantly beyond that achievable at the\nHigh-Luminosity LHC. A central part of the Higgs programme at an e+e- collider\nis the model-independent determination of the absolute Higgs couplings to\nfermions and to gauge bosons. Here the measurement of the e+e-->HZ\nHiggsstrahlung cross section, using the recoil mass technique, sets the\nabsolute scale for all Higgs coupling measurements. Previous studies have\nconsidered e+e- ->ZH with Z->l+l-, where l = electron or muon. In this paper it\nis shown for the first time that a near model-independent recoil mass technique\ncan be extended to the hadronic decays of the Z boson. Because the branching\nratio for Z->qq is approximately ten times greater than for Z->l+l-, this\nmethod is statistically more powerful than using the leptonic decays. For an\nintegrated luminosity of 500 fb-1 at a centre-of-mass energy of 350 GeV at\nCLIC, the e+e-->HZ cross section can be measured to 1.8 % using the hadronic\nrecoil mass technique. A similar precision is found for the ILC operating at\n350 GeV. The centre-of-mass dependence of this measurement technique is\ndiscussed, arguing for the initial operation of a future linear collider at\njust above the top-pair production threshold.\n", "  Electron-positron pair production by the superposition of two laser pulses\nwith different frequencies and amplitudes is analyzed as a particular\nrealization of the assisted dynamic Schwinger effect. It is demonstrated that,\nwithin a non-perturbative kinetic equation framework, an amplification effect\nis conceivable for certain parameters. When both pulses have wavelengths longer\nthan the Compton wavelength, the residual net density of produced pairs is\ndetermined by the resultant field strength. The number of pairs starts to grow\nrapidly if the wavelength of the high-frequency laser component gets close to\nthe Compton wavelength.\n", "  We investigate the reach of the LHC Run 2 and that of a future circular\nhadron collider with up to 100 TeV centre of mass energy for the exploration of\npotential Dark Matter sectors. These dark sectors are conveniently and broadly\ndescribed by simplified models. The simplified models we consider provide\nmicroscopic descriptions of interactions between the Standard Model partons and\nthe dark sector particles mediated by the four basic types of messenger fields:\nscalar, pseudo-scalar, vector or axial-vector. Our analysis extends and updates\nthe previously available results for the LHC at 8 and 14 TeV to 100 TeV for\nmodels with all four messenger types. We revisit and improve the analysis at 14\nTeV, by studying a variety of analysis techniques, concluding that the most\ndiscriminating variables correspond to the missing transverse energy and the\nazimuthal angle between jets in the final state. Going to 100 TeV, the limits\non simplified models of Dark Matter are enhanced significantly, in particular\nfor heavier mediators and dark sector particles, for which the available phase\nspace at the LHC is restricted. The possibility of a 100 TeV collider provides\nan unprecedented coverage of the dark sector basic parameters and a unique\nopportunity to pin down the particle nature of Dark Matter and its interactions\nwith the Standard Model.\n", "  Observations using the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) have found a\nsignificant gamma-ray excess surrounding the center of the Milky Way (GC). One\npossible interpretation of this excess invokes gamma-ray emission from an\nundiscovered population of either young or recycled pulsars densely clustered\nthroughout the inner kiloparsec of the Milky Way. While these systems, by\nconstruction, have individual fluxes that lie below the point source\nsensitivity of the Fermi-LAT, they may already be observed in multiwavelength\nobservations. Notably the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) catalog\nof radio pulsars includes 270 sources observed in the inner 10 degrees around\nthe GC. We calculate the gamma-ray emission observed from these 270 sources and\nobtain three key results: (1) point source searches in the GC region produce a\nplethora of highly significant gamma-ray \"hotspots\", compared to searches far\nfrom the Galactic plane, (2) there is no statistical correlation between the\npositions of these gamma-ray hotspots and the locations of ATNF pulsars, and\n(3) the spectrum of the most statistically significant gamma-ray hotspots is\nsubstantially softer than the spectrum of the GC gamma-ray excess. These\nresults place strong constraints on models where young pulsars produce the\nmajority of the gamma-ray excess, and disfavor some models where millisecond\npulsars produce the gamma-ray excess.\n", "  We relate the unconstrained `double metric' of the `$\\alpha'$-geometry'\nformulation of double field theory to the constrained generalized metric\nencoding the spacetime metric and b-field. This is achieved by integrating out\nauxiliary field components of the double metric in an iterative procedure that\ninduces an infinite number of higher-derivative corrections. As an application\nwe prove that, to first order in $\\alpha'$ and to all orders in fields, the\ndeformed gauge transformations are Green-Schwarz-deformed diffeomorphisms. We\nalso prove that to first order in $\\alpha'$ the spacetime action encodes\nprecisely the Green-Schwarz deformation with Chern-Simons forms based on the\ntorsionless gravitational connection. This seems to be in tension with\nsuggestions in the literature that T-duality requires a torsionful connection,\nbut we explain that these assertions are ambiguous since actions that use\ndifferent connections are related by field redefinitions.\n", "  The fabrication of versatile building blocks that are reliably self-assemble\ninto desired ordered and disordered phases is amongst the hottest topics in\ncontemporary material science. To this end, microscopic units of varying\ncomplexity, aimed at assembling the target phases, have been thought, designed,\ninvestigated and built. Such a path usually requires laborious fabrication\ntechniques, especially when a specific funcionalisation of the building blocks\nis required. Telechelic star polymers, i.e., star polymers made of a number $f$\nof di-block copolymers consisting of solvophobic and solvophilic monomers\ngrafted on a central anchoring point, spontaneously self-assemble into soft\npatchy particles featuring attractive spots (patches) on the surface. Here we\nshow that the tunability of such a system can be widely extended by controlling\nthe physical and chemical parameters of the solution. Indeed, at fixed external\nconditions the self-assembly behaviour depends only on the number of arms\nand/or on the ratio of solvophobic to solvophilic monomers. However, changes in\ntemperature and/or solvent quality makes it possible to reliably change the\nnumber and size of the attractive patches. This allows to steer the mesoscopic\nself-assembly behaviour without modifying the microscopic constituents.\nInterestingly, we also demonstrate that diverse combinations of the parameters\ncan generate stars with the same number of patches but different radial and\nangular stiffness. This mechanism could provide a neat way of further\nfine-tuning the elastic properties of the supramolecular network without\nchanging its topology.\n", "  An experimental study of the electronic structure of copper intercalated\ntitanium dichalcogenides in a wide range of copper concentrations (x = 0.05 -\n0.6) using the x-rays photoemission spectroscopy, resonant photoemission and\nx-rays absorption spectroscopy has been performed. Negative energy shifts of\nthe Ti 2p and Se 3d core levels spectra and a corresponding decrease of the\nphoton energy in Ti 2p absorption spectra with increasing concentration of\ncopper have been found. Such sign-anomalous shifts may be explained by the\nshielding effect of the corresponding atomic shells as a result of the dynamic\ncharge transfer during the formation of a covalent chemical bond between the\ncopper atoms and the TiSe2 matrix.\n", "  A new general route for siRNA delivery is presented combining porous\ncore-shell silica nanocarriers with a modularly designed multifunctional block\ncopolymer. Specifically, the internal storage and release of siRNA from\nmesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) with orthogonal core-shell surface\nchemistry was investigated as a function of pore-size, pore morphology, surface\nproperties and pH. Very high siRNA loading capacities of up to 380 microg/mg\nMSN were obtained with charge-matched amino-functionalized mesoporous cores,\nand release profiles show up to 80% siRNA elution after 24 h. We demonstrate\nthat adsorption and desorption of siRNA is mainly driven by electrostatic\ninteractions, which allow for high loading capacities even in medium-sized\nmesopores with pore diameters down to 4 nm in a stellate pore morphology. The\nnegatively charged MSN shell enabled the association with a block copolymer\ncontaining positively charged artificial amino acids and oleic acid blocks,\nwhich acts simultaneously as capping function and endosomal release agent. The\npotential of this multifunctional delivery platform is demonstrated by highly\neffective cell transfection and siRNA delivery into KB-cells. A luciferase\nreporter gene knock-down of up to 90% was possible using extremely low cell\nexposures with only 2.5 microg MSN containing 32 pM siRNA per 100 microL well.\n", "  We consider the circle and torus compactification of a certain subclass of 6d\n$\\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ SCFTs which are Higgsable to the higher rank E-string\ntheories. Using the T-duality between Type I' and Type IIB, we found that the\n$S^1$ compactification of the theories can be realized by 5-brane webs\ndescribing the 5d uplifting of a specified class S theory, generalizing the\nresult by Benini, Benvenuti and Tachikawa. We checked the above result by\ncalculating conformal and flavor central charges of the 4d torus compactified\ntheory both from the tensor branch structure of the 6d theory and from the\npredicted class S description.\n", "  We examine the possibility of observing the Kaluza-Klein gluons in\ngauge-Higgs unification models at the LHC with the energy sqrt{s}=14 TeV. We\nconsider a benchmark model with the gauge symmetry SU(3)_C x SU(3)_W in\nfive-dimensional space-time, where SU(3)_C is the gauge symmetry of the strong\ninteraction and SU(3)_W is that for the electroweak interaction and a Higgs\ndoublet field. It is natural in general to introduce SU(3)_C gauge symmetry in\nfive-dimensional space-time as well as SU(3)_W gauge symmetry in gauge-Higgs\nunification models. Since the fifth dimension is compactified to S1/Z2\norbifold, there are Kaluza-Klein modes of gluons in low-energy effective theory\nin four-dimensional space-time. We investigate the resonance contribution of\nthe first Kaluza-Klein gluon to dijet invariant mass distribution at the LHC,\nand provide signal-to-noise ratios in various cases of Kaluza-Klein gluon\nmasses and kinematical cuts. Although the results are given in a specific\nbenchmark model, we discuss their application to general gauge-Higgs\nunification models with Kaluza-Klein gluons. Gauge-Higgs unification models can\nbe verified or constrained through the physics of the strong interaction,\nthough they are proposed to solve the naturalness problem in electroweak\nsymmetry breaking.\n", "  Exact analytic solution for the probability distribution function of the\nnon-inertial rotational diffusion equation, i.e., of the Smoluchowski one, in a\nsymmetric Maier-Saupe uniaxial potential of mean torque is obtained via the\nconfluent Heun's function. Both the ordinary Maier-Saupe potential and the\ndouble-well one with variable barrier width are considered. Thus, the present\narticle substantially extends the scope of the potentials amenable to the\ntreatment by reducing Smoluchowski equation to the confluent Heun's one. The\nsolution is uniformly valid for any barrier height. We use it for the\ncalculation of the mean first passage time. Also the higher eigenvalues for the\nrelaxation decay modes in the case of ordinary Maier-Saupe potential are\ncalculated. The results obtained are in full agreement with those of the\napproach developed by Coffey, Kalmykov, D\\'ejardin and their coauthors in the\nwhole range of barrier heights.\n", "  The structural and thermal properties of bulk Td-WTe2 have been studied by\nusing first-principles calculations. We find that the lattice thermal\nconductivity of WTe2 is anisotropic, with the highest value along a-axis and\nlowest one along the c-axis at 300 K. Our calculated size dependent thermal\nconductivity shows that nanostructuring of WTe2 can possibly further decrease\nthe lattice thermal conductivity. Such extremely low thermal conductivity, even\nmuch lower than WSe2, makes WTe2 attractive for use as thermal-insulation\nmaterial for thermoelectric devices.\n", "  A specific Horndeski scalar-gravity mimetic model is investigated within a\nFLWR space-time. The mimetic scalar field is implemented via a Lagrangian\nmultiplier, and it is shown that the model has equations of motion formally\nsimilar to the original simpler mimetic matter model of\nChamseddine-Mukhanov-Vikman. Several exact solutions describing inflation,\nbounces, future time singularities are presented and discussed.\n", "  We study \"field space entanglement\" in certain quantum field theories\nconsisting of N number of free scalar fields interacting with each other via\nkinetic mixing terms. We present exact analytic expressions for entanglement\nend Renyi entropies between arbitrary number of scalar fields by which we could\nexplore certain entanglement inequalities. Other entanglement measures such as\nmutual information and entanglement negativity have also been studied. We also\ngive some comments about possible holographic realizations of such models.\n", "  In order to improve the key rate of the decoy-state method, we need to\njointly study yields of different bases. Given the delicate fact that pulses of\nthe same preparation state can have different counting rates if they are\nmeasured in different bases, for example, those vacuum pulses and those\nsingle-photon pulses, existing results of decoy-state quantum key distribution\nusing biased bases are actually flawed by assuming that they are equal. We fix\nthis flaw through using the idea that yields of pulses prepared in different\nbases are same provided that they are prepared in the same state and also they\nare measured in the same basis, for example, those single-photon pulses\nprepared in different bases but measured in the same basis. Based on this, we\npresent correct formulas for the decoy-state method using biased bases. Taking\nthe effects of statistical fluctuations into account, we then numerically study\nthe key rates of different protocols with all parameters being fully optimized.\nOur result confirms the prior art conclusion that decoy-state method using\nbiased bases can have advantage to the symmetric protocol with unbiased bases.\nWe obtain high key rates of our 4-intensity protocol (two in X bases and two in\nZ bases) without using any vacuum source.\n", "  This work describes a mechanical approach for manipulating the capillary\nlength and spreading of liquid coatings on flexible substrates with high\ngravity. Experimental verification in the literature has focused on cases under\nstandard gravity on earth, and to the authors' knowledge, this work is the\nfirst to explore its relevance to spreading puddles under high gravity. By\nusing centrifugation with a high-density liquid base underneath a coated\nsubstrate, it is possible to apply acceleration normal to a substrate to\ndecrease the capillary length and increase the rate of spreading. Due to the\nnature of centrifugation, this method works primarily on flexible substrates,\nwhich bend with a curvature that conforms to a contour of uniformly distributed\ncentrifugal acceleration. With high gravity of 600 g applied, the capillary\nlength reduces by a factor of 24.5, and the spreading shifts from \"transient\nspreading\" between the surface tension-driven and gravity-driven regimes to the\ngravity-driven regime. Experimental results show that high gravitational\nacceleration will enhance the rate of spreading such that a puddle, which would\nrequire 12 hours under standard gravity on earth to go from an 8-{\\mu}l droplet\nto a 40-{\\mu}m thick puddle, would require less than 1 minute under 600 g.\nOverall, this work suggests that previously derived expressions for\ngravity-driven spreading of puddles under earth's standard gravity extend to\npredicting the behavior of puddles spreading on smooth, wetting substrates\nexposed to more than 100 g's of acceleration.\n", "  We report the discovery of a stellar stream in the Dark Energy Survey (DES)\nYear 1 (Y1A1) data. The discovery was made through simple color-magnitude\nfilters and visual inspection of the Y1A1 data. We refer to this new object as\nthe Phoenix stream, after its resident constellation. After subtraction of the\nbackground stellar population we detect a clear signal of a simple stellar\npopulation. By fitting the ridge line of the stream in color-magnitude space,\nwe find that a stellar population with age $\\tau=11.5\\pm0.5$ Gyr and\n$[Fe/H]<-1.6$ located 17.5$\\pm$0.9 kpc from the Sun gives an adequate\ndescription of the stream stellar population. The stream is detected over an\nextension of 8$^{\\circ}.$1 (2.5 kpc) and has a width of $\\sim$54 pc assuming a\nGaussian profile, indicating that a globular cluster is a probable progenitor.\nThere is no known globular cluster within 5 kpc compatible with being the\nprogenitor of the stream, assuming that the stream traces its orbit. We\nexamined overdensities along the stream, however no obvious counterpart bound\nstellar system is visible in the coadded images. We also find overdensities\nalong the stream that appear to be symmetrically distributed - consistent with\nthe epicyclic overdensity scenario for the formation of cold streams - as well\nas a misalignment between the Northern and Southern part of stream. Despite the\nclose proximity we find no evidence that this stream and the halo cluster NGC\n1261 have a common accretion origin linked to the recently found EriPhe\noverdensity (Li et al. 2016).\n", "  We show that minimal boson stars, i.e. boson stars made out of scalar fields\nwithout self-interaction, are always classically unstable in 5 space-time\ndimensions. This is true for the non-rotating as well as rotating case with two\nequal angular momenta and in both Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet gravity,\nrespectively, and contrasts with the 4-dimensional case, where classically\nstable minimal boson stars exist. We also discuss the appearance of ergoregions\nfor rotating boson stars with two equal angular momenta. While rotating black\nholes typically possess an ergoregion, rotating compact objects without\nhorizons such as boson stars have ergoregions only in a limited range of the\nparameter space. In this paper, we show for which values of the parameters\nthese ergoregions appear and compare this with the case of standard Einstein\ngravity. We also point out that the interplay between Gauss-Bonnet gravity and\nrotation puts constraints on the behaviour of the space-time close to the\nrotation axis.\n", "  A distribution function approach is applied to describe the dynamics of the\nlaser beam in the Earth atmosphere. Using a formal solution of the kinetic\nequation for the distribution function, we have developed an iterative scheme\nfor calculation of the scintillation index ($\\sigma^2$). The problem reduces to\nobtaining the photon trajectories and their correlations. Bringing together\ntheoretical calculations and many-fold computer integrations, the value of\n$\\sigma^2$ is obtained. It is shown that a considerable growth of $\\sigma^2$ in\nthe range of a moderate turbulence is due to the correlations of different\ntrajectories. The criteria of applicability of our approach for both the\ncoherent and partially coherent light are derived.\n", "  We introduce an analytical model to study the evolution towards equilibrium\nin spatial games, with `memory-aware' agents, i.e., agents that accumulate\ntheir payoff over time. In particular, we focus our attention on the spatial\nPrisoner's Dilemma, as it constitutes an emblematic example of a game whose\nNash equilibrium is defection. Previous investigations showed that, under\nopportune conditions, it is possible to reach, in the evolutionary Prisoner's\nDilemma, an equilibrium of cooperation. Notably, it seems that mechanisms like\nmotion may lead a population to become cooperative. In the proposed model, we\nmap agents to particles of a gas so that, on varying the system temperature,\nthey randomly move. In doing so, we are able to identify a relation between the\ntemperature and the final equilibrium of the population, explaining how it is\npossible to break the classical Nash equilibrium in the spatial Prisoner's\nDilemma when considering agents able to increase their payoff over time.\nMoreover, we introduce a formalism to study order-disorder phase transitions in\nthese dynamics. As result, we highlight that the proposed model allows to\nexplain analytically how a population, whose interactions are based on the\nPrisoner's Dilemma, can reach an equilibrium far from the expected one; opening\nalso the way to define a direct link between evolutionary game theory and\nstatistical physics.\n", "  Recent theoretical studies have shown that demographic stochasticity can\ngreatly increase the tendency of asexually reproducing phenotypically diverse\norganisms to spontaneously evolve into localised clusters, suggesting a simple\nmechanism for sympatric speciation. Here we study the role of demographic\nstochasticity in a model of competing organisms subject to assortative mating.\nWe find that in models with sexual reproduction, noise can also lead to the\nformation of phenotypic clusters in parameter ranges where deterministic models\nwould lead to a homogeneous distribution. In some cases, noise can have a\nsizeable effect, rendering the deterministic modelling insufficient to\nunderstand the phenotypic distribution.\n", "  We investigate three tree-dominated $B \\to a_0 a_0$ decays for the first time\nin the perturbative QCD(pQCD) approach at leading order in the standard model,\nwith $a_0$ standing for the light scalar $a_0(980)$ state, which is assumed as\na meson based on the model of conventional two-quark$(q\\bar q)$ structure. All\nthe topologies of the Feynman diagrams such as the non-factorizable spectator\nones and the annihilation ones are calculated in the pQCD approach. It is of\ngreat interest to find that, contrary to the known $B \\to \\pi \\pi$ decays, the\n$B \\to a_0 a_0$ decays are governed by the large non-factorizable\ncontributions, which give rise to the large $B \\to a_0 a_0$ decay rates in the\norder of $10^{-6} \\sim 10^{-5}$, although the $a_0$ meson has an extremely\nsmall vector decay constant $f_{a_0}$. Also observed are large direct\nCP-violating asymmetries around $15\\%$ and $30\\%$ for the $B^0 \\to a_0^0 a_0^0$\nand $a_0^+ a_0^-$ modes. These sizable predictions could be easily examined at\nthe running Large Hadron Collider and the near future Super-B/Belle-II\nexperiments. The future precision measurements combined with these pQCD\npredictions might be helpful to explore the complicated QCD dynamics and the\ninner structure of the light scalar $a_0$, as well as to complementarily\nconstrain the unitary angle $\\alpha$.\n", "  Motivated by the recent experimental observations on clustering of motor\nproteins on microtubule filament, we study an open system of two parallel\ntotally asymmetric simple exclusion processes under asymmetric coupling\nconditions, which incorporates the mutual interaction with the surrounding\nenvironment through Langmuir Kinetics in both the lanes. In the modified\nLangmuir Kinetics, the attachment and detachment rates depends on the\nconfiguration of nearest neighboring sites. We analyse the model within the\nframework of continuum mean-field theory and the phase diagrams along with\ndensity profiles are obtained using boundary layer analysis. The effect of\nmutual interactions on the phase diagram for two different situations of\nattachment and detachment (LK) rates is discussed. Under the symmetric LK\ndynamics, the topological structure of the phase diagram remains similar to the\none in without mutual interaction; while for the antisymmetric case, after a\ncertain critical value of attractive/repulsive mutual attraction, significant\nchanges are found in the qualitative nature of phase diagram. Moreover, it is\nshown that the type of mutual interaction affects the dynamic properties of\nmotor proteins. The theoretical findings are examined by extensive Monte-Carlo\nsimulations.\n", "  We have addressed the microscopic transport mechanism at the switching or\non-off transition in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) field-effect\ntransistors (FET), which has been a controversial topic in TMDC electronics,\nespecially at room temperature. With simultaneous measurement of channel\nconductivity and its slow time-dependent fluctuation (or noise) in ultra-thin\nWSe2 and MoS2 FETs on insulating SiO2 substrates, where noise arises from\nMcWhorter-type carrier number fluctuations, we establish that the switching in\nconventional backgated TMDC FETs is a classical percolation transition in a\nmedium of inhomogeneous carrier density distribution. From the experimentally\nobserved exponents in the scaling of noise magnitude with conductivity, we\nobserve unambiguous signatures of percolation in random resistor network,\nparticularly in WSe2 FETs close to switching, which crosses over to continuum\npercolation at a higher doping level. We demonstrate a powerful experimental\nprobe to the microscopic nature of near-threshold electrical transport in TMDC\nFETs, irrespective of the material detail, device geometry or carrier mobility,\nwhich can be extended to other classes of 2D material-based devices as well.\n", "  We present a Mathematica package designed to automatize the expansion of QFT\ntransition amplitudes calculated in the mass eigenstates basis (i.e. expressed\nin terms of physical masses and mixing matrices) into series of \"mass\ninsertions\", defined as off-diagonal entries of mass matrices in Lagrangian\nbefore diagonalization and identification of the physical states. The algorithm\nimplemented in this package is based on the general \"Flavor Expansion Theorem\"\nproven in Ref.~\\cite{FET}. The supplied routines are able to automatically\nanalyze the structure of the amplitude, identify the parts which could be\nexpanded and expand them to any required order. They are capable of dealing\nwith amplitudes depending on both scalar or vector (Hermitian) and Dirac or\nMajorana fermion (complex) mass matrices. The package can be downloaded from\nthe address www.fuw.edu.pl/masstomi.\n", "  Searching for new non-perturbatively renormalizable quantum gravity theories,\nfunctional renormalization group (RG) flows are studied on a theory space of\naction functionals depending on the metric and the torsion tensor, the latter\nparameterized by three irreducible component fields. A detailed comparison with\nQuantum Einstein-Cartan Gravity (QECG), Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG), and\n\"tetrad-only\" gravity, all based on different theory spaces, is performed. It\nis demonstrated that, over a generic theory space, the construction of a\nfunctional RG equation (FRGE) for the effective average action requires the\nspecification of a metric on the infinite-dimensional field manifold as an\nadditional input. A modified FRGE is obtained if this metric is\nscale-dependent, as it happens in the metric-torsion system considered.\n", "  We review the salient features of two advanced nodes of an 8-Nb-layer fully\nplanarized process developed recently at MIT Lincoln Laboratory for fabricating\nSingle Flux Quantum(SFQ) digital circuits with very large scale integration on\n200-mm wafers: the SFQ4ee and SFQ5ee nodes, where 'ee' denotes the process is\ntuned for energy efficient SFQ circuits. The former has eight superconducting\nlayers with 0.5 {\\mu}m minimum feature size and a 2 {\\Omega}/sq Mo layer for\ncircuit resistors. The latter has nine superconducting layers: eight Nb wiring\nlayers with the minimum feature size of 350 nm and a thin superconducting MoNx\nlayer (Tc ~ 7.5 K) with high kinetic inductance (about 8 pH/sq) for forming\ncompact inductors. A nonsuperconducting (Tc < 2 K) MoNx layer with lower\nnitrogen content is used for 6 {\\Omega}/sq planar resistors for shunting and\nbiasing of Josephson junctions. Another resistive layer is added to form\ninterlayer, sandwich-type resistors of m{\\Omega} range for releasing unwanted\nflux quanta from superconducting loops of logic cells. Both process nodes use\nAu/Pt/Ti contact metallization for chip packaging. The technology utilizes one\nlayer of Nb/AlOx-Al/Nb JJs with critical current density, Jc of 100\n{\\mu}A/{\\mu}m^2 and minimum diameter of 700 nm. Circuit patterns are defined by\n248-nm photolithography and high density plasma etching. All circuit layers are\nfully planarized using chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) of SiO2\ninterlayer dielectric. The following results and topics are presented and\ndiscussed: the effect of surface topography under the JJs on the their\nproperties and repeatability, critical current and Jc targeting, effect of\nhydrogen dissolved in Nb, MoNx properties for the resistor layer and for high\nkinetic inductance layer, technology of m{\\Omega}-range resistors.\n", "  We generalize the control power of a perfect controlled teleportation of an\nentangled three-qubit pure state, suggested by Li and Ghose [Phys. Rev. A {\\bf\n90}, 052305 (2014)], to the control power of a general controlled teleportation\nof a multiqubit pure state. Thus, we define the minimal control power, and\ncalculate the values of the minimal control power for a class of general\nthree-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and the three-qubit W\nclass whose states have zero three-tangles. Moreover, we show that the standard\nthree-qubit GHZ state and the standard three-qubit W state have the maximal\nvalues of the minimal control power for the two classes, respectively. This\nmeans that the minimal control power can be interpreted as not only an\noperational quantity of a three-qubit quantum communication but also a degree\nof three-qubit entanglement. In addition, we calculate the values of the\nminimal control power for general n-qubit GHZ states and the n-qubit W-type\nstates.\n", "  Based on symmetry consideration of migration and shape deformations, we\nformulate phenomenologically the dynamics of cell crawling in two dimensions.\nForces are introduced to change the cell shape. The shape deformations induce\nmigration of the cell on a substrate. For time-independent forces we show that\nnot only a stationary motion but also a limit cycle oscillation of the\nmigration velocity and the shape occurs as a result of nonlinear coupling\nbetween different deformation modes. Time-dependent forces are generated in a\nstochastic manner by utilizing the so-called coherence resonance of an\nexcitable system. The present coarse-grained model has a flexibility that it\ncan be applied, e.g., both to keratocyte cells and to Dictyostelium cells,\nwhich exhibit quite different dynamics from each other. The key factors for the\nmotile behavior inherent in each cell type are identified in our model.\n", "  Antiferromagnetic materials are magnetic inside, however, the direction of\ntheir ordered microscopic moments alternates between individual atomic sites.\nThe resulting zero net magnetic moment makes magnetism in antiferromagnets\ninvisible on the outside. It also implies that if information was stored in\nantiferromagnetic moments it would be insensitive to disturbing external\nmagnetic fields, and the antiferromagnetic element would not affect\nmagnetically its neighbors no matter how densely the elements were arranged in\na device. The intrinsic high frequencies of antiferromagnetic dynamics\nrepresent another property that makes antiferromagnets distinct from\nferromagnets. The outstanding question is how to efficiently manipulate and\ndetect the magnetic state of an antiferromagnet. In this article we give an\noverview of recent works addressing this question. We also review studies\nlooking at merits of antiferromagnetic spintronics from a more general\nperspective of spin-ransport, magnetization dynamics, and materials research,\nand give a brief outlook of future research and applications of\nantiferromagnetic spintronics.\n", "  Non-perturbative approaches to quantum gravity call for a deep understanding\nof the emergence of geometry and locality from the quantum state of the\ngravitational field. Without background geometry, the notion of distance should\nentirely emerge from the correlations between the gravity fluctuations. In the\ncontext of loop quantum gravity, quantum states of geometry are defined as spin\nnetworks. These are graphs decorated with spin and intertwiners, which\nrepresent quantized excitations of areas and volumes of the space geometry.\nHere, we develop the condensed matter point of view on extracting the physical\nand geometrical information out of spin network states: we introduce new Ising\nspin network states, both in 2d on a square lattice and in 3d on a hexagonal\nlattice, whose correlations map onto the usual Ising model in statistical\nphysics. We construct these states from the basic holonomy operators of loop\ngravity and derive a set of local Hamiltonian constraints which entirely\ncharacterize our states. We discuss their phase diagram and show how the\ndistance can be reconstructed from the correlations in the various phases.\nFinally, we propose generalizations of these Ising states, which open the\nperspective to study the coarse graining and dynamics of spin network states\nusing well-known condensed matter techniques and results.\n", "  We study the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model (NMSSM) with the\nTeV scale mirage mediation, which is known as a solution for the little\nhierarchy problem in supersymmetry. Our previous study showed that 125 GeV\nHiggs boson is realized with O(10) % fine-tuning for 1.5 TeV gluino (1 TeV\nstop) mass. The $\\mu$ term could be as large as 500 GeV without sacrificing the\nfine-tuning thanks to a cancellation mechanism. The singlet-doublet mixing is\nsuppressed by $\\tan\\beta$. In this paper, we further extend this analysis. We\nargue that approximate scale symmetries play a role behind the suppression of\nthe singlet-doublet mixing. They reduce the mixing matrix to a simple form that\nis useful to understand the results of the numerical analysis. We perform a\ncomprehensive analysis of the fine-tuning including the singlet sector by\nintroducing a simple formula for the fine-tuning measure. This shows that the\nsinglet mass of the least fine-tuning is favored by the LEP anomaly for\nmoderate $\\tan\\beta$. We also discuss prospects for the precision measurements\nof the Higgs couplings at LHC and ILC and direct/indirect dark matter searches\nin the model.\n", "  We conjecture closed-form expressions for the Macdonald limits of the\nsuperconformal indices of the (A_1, A_{2n-3}) and (A_1, D_{2n}) Argyres-Douglas\n(AD) theories in terms of certain simple deformations of Macdonald polynomials.\nAs checks of our conjectures, we demonstrate compatibility with two\nS-dualities, we show symmetry enhancement for special values of n, and we argue\nthat our expressions encode a non-trivial set of renormalization group flows.\nMoreover, we demonstrate that, for certain values of n, our conjectures imply\nsimple operator relations involving composites built out of the SU(2)_R\ncurrents and flavor symmetry moment maps, and we find a consistent picture in\nwhich these relations give rise to certain null states in the corresponding\nchiral algebras. In addition, we show that the Hall-Littlewood limits of our\nindices are equivalent to the corresponding Higgs branch Hilbert series. We\nexplain this fact by considering the S^1 reductions of our theories and showing\nthat the equivalence follows from an inequality on monopole quantum numbers\nwhose coefficients are fixed by data of the four-dimensional parent theories.\nFinally, we comment on the implications of our work for more general N=2\nsuperconformal field theories.\n", "  The transition helicity amplitudes from the proton ground state to the\n$N(1440)1/2^+$, $N(1520)3/2^-$, and $\\Delta(1620)1/2^-$ resonances\n($\\gamma_vpN^*$ electrocouplings) were determined from the analysis of nine\nindependent one-fold differential $\\pi^+ \\pi^- p$ electroproduction cross\nsections off a proton target, taken with CLAS at photon virtualities 0.5\nGeV$^2$ $< Q^2 <$ 1.5 GeV$^2$. The phenomenological reaction model employed for\nseparation of the resonant and non-resonant contributions to this exclusive\nchannel was further developed. The $N(1440)1/2^+$, $N(1520)3/2^-$, and\n$\\Delta(1620)1/2^-$ electrocouplings were obtained from the resonant amplitudes\nof charged double-pion electroproduction off the proton in the aforementioned\narea of photon virtualities for the first time. Consistent results on\n$\\gamma_vpN^*$ electrocouplings available from independent analyses of several\n$W$-intervals with different non-resonant contributions offer clear evidence\nfor the reliable extraction of these fundamental quantities. These studies also\nimproved the knowledge on hadronic branching ratios for the $N(1440)1/2^+$,\n$N(1520)3/2^-$, and $\\Delta(1620)1/2^-$ decays to the $\\pi \\Delta$ and $\\rho N$\nfinal states. These new results provide a substantial impact on the QCD-based\napproaches that describe the $N^*$ structure and demonstrate the capability to\nexplore fundamental ingredients of the non-perturbative strong interaction that\nare behind the excited nucleon state formation.\n", "  This paper establishes that generic linear quantum stochastic systems have a\npure cascade realization of their transfer function, generalizing an earlier\nresult established only for the special class of completely passive linear\nquantum stochastic systems. In particular, a cascade realization therefore\nexists for generic active linear quantum stochastic systems that require an\nexternal source of quanta to operate. The results facilitate a simplified\nrealization of generic linear quantum stochastic systems for applications such\nas coherent feedback control and optical filtering. The key tools that are\ndeveloped are algorithms for symplectic QR and Schur decompositions. It is\nshown that generic real square matrices of even dimension can be transformed\ninto a lower $2 \\times 2$ block triangular form by a symplectic similarity\ntransformation. The linear algebraic results herein may be of independent\ninterest for applications beyond the problem of transfer function realization\nfor quantum systems. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the main\nresults. In particular, one example describes an equivalent realization of the\ntransfer function of a nondegenerate parametric amplifier as the cascade\ninterconnection of two degenerate parametric amplifiers with an additional\noutcoupling mirror.\n", "  We study the effect of the MeV-scale asymmetric dark matter annihilation on\nthe effective number of neutrinos $N_{\\rm eff}$ at the epoch of the big bang\nnucleosynthesis. If the asymmetric dark matter $\\chi$ couples more strongly to\nthe neutrinos $\\nu$ than to the photons $\\gamma$ and electrons $e^-$,\n$\\Gamma_{\\chi\\gamma, \\chi e} \\ll \\Gamma_{\\chi\\nu}$, or $\\Gamma_{\\chi\\gamma,\n\\chi e} \\gg \\Gamma_{\\chi\\nu}$, the lower mass limit on the asymmetric dark\nmatter is about $18$ MeV for $N_{\\rm eff}\\simeq 3.0$.\n", "  In this paper, we study the experimental signatures of a gluophilic $Z'$ at\nthe LHC, in particular through the analysis of three jets or four tops events.\nThe $Z'$ couples to gluons through dimension six operators and the parameter\nspace is constrained with experimental searches released at 7 and 8\n$\\mathrm{TeV}$ by CMS along these two different channels. Existing constraints\ncoming from the study of dark matter where the $Z'$ represents a possible\nmediator between the latter and the Standard Model are also included for\ncomparison. Prospects at $\\sqrt s=13$ TeV allow us to evaluate for which values\nof the parameter space a gluophilic $Z'$ could be discovered during the next\nrun of the LHC. In particular, we show that the analysis of the three jets\ninvariant mass could provide a clear signal ($>5\\sigma$) for masses of the $Z'$\nabove 300 $\\mathrm{GeV}$. Four tops events bring in addition further discovery\npotential for heavy $Z'$ (above $\\sim 2~\\mathrm{TeV}$). A combination of both\nsignals in four top channels and three jets analyses during the next run of the\nLHC could thus provide a clear signal of the presence of a heavy gluophilic\n$Z'$.\n", "  Precisely measured electron-proton elastic scattering cross sections [Phys.\nRev. Lett. {\\bf 105}, 242002 (2010)] are reanalyzed to evaluate their strength\nfor determining the rms charge radius ($R_{\\rm E}$) of the proton. More than\nhalf of the cross sections at lowest $Q^2$ are fit using two single-parameter\nform-factor models, with the first based on a dipole parametrization, and the\nsecond on a linear fit to a conformal-mapping variable. These low-$Q^2$ fits\nextrapolate the slope of the form factor to $Q^2$=0 and determine $R_{\\rm E}$\nvalues of approximately 0.84 and 0.89~fm, respectively. Fits spanning all\n$Q^2$, in which the single constants are replaced with cubic splines at larger\n$Q^2$, lead to similar results for $R_{\\rm E}$. We conclude that the scattering\ndata is consistent with $R_{\\rm E}$ ranging from at least 0.84 to 0.89~fm, and\ntherefore cannot resolve the discrepancy between determinations of $R_{\\rm E}$\nmade using muonic and electronic hydrogen-atom spectroscopy.\n", "  In this work we present a new generic feature of PT-symmetric Bose-Einstein\ncondensates by studying the many-particle description of a two-mode condensate\nwith balanced gain and loss. This is achieved using a master equation in\nLindblad form whose mean-field limit is a PT-symmetric Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation. It is shown that the purity of the condensate periodically drops to\nsmall values but then is nearly completely restored. This has a direct impact\non the average contrast in interference experiments which cannot be covered by\nthe mean-field approximation, in which a completely pure condensate is assumed.\n", "  We present theoretical predictions for mono-$Z$ production in the search for\ndark matter in Run-II at the LHC, including next-to-leading order QCD\ncorrections and parton-shower effects. We consider generic simplified models\nwith vector and scalar $s$-channel mediators. The calculation is performed by\nimplementing the simplified models in the FeynRules/MadGraph5_aMC@NLO\nframework, which allows us to include higher-order QCD corrections and\nparton-shower effects in an automated way. We find that these corrections are\nsizeable and help to reduce the theoretical uncertainties. We also investigate\nthe discovery potential in several benchmark scenarios in the 13 TeV run at the\nLHC.\n", "  The relativistic properties of the three-nucleon system are investigated\nusing the Faddeev equations within the Bethe-Salpeter approach. The\nnucleon-nucleon interaction is chosen in a separable form. The Gauss quadrature\nmethod is used to calculate the integrals. The system of the integral equations\nare solving by iterations method. The binding energy and the partial-wave\namplitudes (1S 0 and 3S 1) of the triton are found.\n", "  We propose an importance-truncation scheme for the large-scale nuclear shell\nmodel that extends its range of applicability to larger valence spaces and\nmid-shell nuclei. It is based on a perturbative measure for the importance of\nindividual basis states that acts as an additional truncation for the many-body\nmodel space in which the eigenvalue problem of the Hamiltonian is solved\nnumerically. Through a posteriori extrapolations of all observables to\nvanishing importance threshold, the full shell-model results can be recovered.\nIn addition to simple threshold extrapolations, we explore extrapolations based\non the energy variance. We apply the importance-truncated shell model for the\nstudy of 56-Ni in the pf valence space and of 60-Zn and 64-Ge in the pfg9/2\nspace. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the approach, which pave\nthe way for future shell-model calculations in larger valence spaces with\nvalence-space interactions derived in ab initio approaches.\n", "  There is a common need in astroparticle experiments such as direct dark\nmatter detection, 0{\\nu}\\b{eta}\\b{eta} (double beta decay without emission of\nneutrinos) and Coherent Neutrino Nucleus Scattering experiments for light\ndetectors with a very low energy threshold. By employing the Neganov-Luke\nEffect, the thermal signal of particle interactions in a semiconductor absorber\noperated at cryogenic temperatures, can be amplified by drifting the\nphotogenerated electrons and holes in an electric field. This technology is not\nused in current experiments, in particular because of a reduction of the signal\namplitude with time which is due to trapping of the charges within the\nabsorber. We present here the first results of a novel type of Neganov-Luke\nEffect detector with an electric field configuration designed to improve the\ncharge collection within the semiconductor.\n", "  The instantaneous luminosity of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN will be\nincreased up to a factor of five with respect to the present design value by\nundergoing an extensive upgrade program over the coming decade. The most\nimportant upgrade project for the ATLAS Muon System is the replacement of the\npresent first station in the forward regions with the so-called New Small\nWheels (NSWs). The NSWs will be installed during the LHC long shutdown in\n2018/19. Small-Strip Thin Gap Chamber (sTGC) detectors are designed to provide\nfast trigger and high precision muon tracking under the high luminosity LHC\nconditions. To validate the design, a full-size prototype sTGC detector of\napproximately 1.2 $\\times$ $1.0\\, \\mathrm{m}^2$ consisting of four gaps has\nbeen constructed. Each gap provides pad, strip and wire readouts. The sTGC\nintrinsic spatial resolution has been measured in a $32\\, \\mathrm{GeV}$ pion\nbeam test at Fermilab. At perpendicular incidence angle, single gap position\nresolutions of about $50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ have been obtained, uniform along the\nsTGC strip and perpendicular wire directions, well within design requirements.\nPad readout measurements have been performed in a $130\\, \\mathrm{GeV}$ muon\nbeam test at CERN. The transition region between readout pads has been found to\nbe $4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, and the pads have been found to be fully efficient.\n", "  Pb doping effect in the Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10}$ compound (Bi2223) on\nthe structural and electronic properties were investigated, using the Local\nDensity (LDA) and Virtual Crystal (VCA) approximations within the framework of\nthe Density Functional Theory (DFT), taking as reference the procedure\nimplemented by H.Lin {\\it et al.} in the Bi2212 compound [{\\it Phys. Rev.\nLett.} {\\bf 96} (2006) 097001]. Results show that, the incorporation of\nPb-dopant in Bi2223 lead a rigid displacement of the Bi/Pb-O bands toward\nhigher energies, with a null contribution at the Fermi level, around the high\nsymmetry point $\\overline{\\text{M}}$ in the irreducible Brillouin zone, for Pb\ndoping concentration equal to or more than 26\\%, avoiding the presence of the\nso-called Bi-O {\\it pockets} in the Fermi surface, in good agreement with\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and nuclear magnetic\nresonance (NMR) experiments, although a slight metallic character of the Bi-O\nbonds is still observed which would disagree with some experimental reports.\nThe calculations show that the changes on the structural properties are\nassociated to the presence or absence of the Bi-O {\\it pockets} in the Fermi\nsurface\n", "  The two-point clustering of dark matter halos is influenced by halo\nproperties besides mass, a phenomenon referred to as halo assembly bias. Using\nthe depth of the gravitational potential well, $V_{\\rm max}$, as our secondary\nhalo property, in this paper we present the first study of the scale-dependence\nassembly bias. In the large-scale linear regime, $r\\geq10h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc},$ our\nfindings are in keeping with previous results. In particular, at the low-mass\nend ($M_{\\rm vir}<M_{\\rm coll}\\approx10^{12.5}{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$), halos with\nhigh-$V_{\\rm max}$ show stronger large-scale clustering relative to halos with\nlow-$V_{\\rm max}$ of the same mass, this trend weakens and reverses for $M_{\\rm\nvir}\\geq M_{\\rm coll}.$ In the nonlinear regime, assembly bias in low-mass\nhalos exhibits a pronounced scale-dependent \"bump\" at $500h^{-1}{\\rm\nkpc}-5h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc},$ a new result. This feature weakens and eventually\nvanishes for halos of higher mass. We show that this scale-dependent signature\ncan primarily be attributed to a special subpopulation of ejected halos,\ndefined as present-day host halos that were previously members of a higher-mass\nhalo at some point in their past history. A corollary of our results is that\ngalaxy clustering on scales of $r\\sim1-2h^{-1}{\\rm Mpc}$ can be impacted by up\nto $\\sim15\\%$ by the choice of the halo property used in the halo model, even\nfor stellar mass-limited samples.\n", "  Assuming that the $f'_2(1525)$ and $K^*_2(1430)$ resonances are dynamically\ngenerated states from the vector meson-vector meson interactions in $S$-wave\nwith spin $S=2$, we study the $\\gamma p \\to f'_2(1525) p$ and $\\gamma p \\to\nK^*_2(1430) \\Lambda (\\Sigma)$ reactions. These reactions proceed in the\nfollowing way: the incoming photon first mutates into a $\\rho^0$, $\\omega$, or\n$\\phi$ meson via vector meson dominance, which then interacts with the\n$\\rho^0$, $\\omega$ or $K^*$ emitted by the incoming proton to form the tensor\nmesons $f'_2(1525)$ and $K^*_2(1430)$. The picture is simple and has no free\nparameters, as all the parameters of the mechanism have been fixed in previous\nstudies. We predict the differential and total cross sections of these\nreactions. The results can be tested in future experiments and therefore offer\nnew clues on the nature of these tensor states.\n", "  One of the most important predictions in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is that\nin the presence of a uniform magnetic field $\\textbf{b}_{0}$ a transition from\nweak to strong wave turbulence should occur when going from large to small\nperpendicular scales. This transition is believed to be a universal property of\nseveral anisotropic turbulent systems. We present for the first time direct\nevidence of such a transition thanks to a three-dimensional direct numerical\nsimulation of incompressible balanced MHD turbulence with a grid resolution of\n$3072^2 \\times 256$. From large to small-scales, the change of regime is\ncharacterized by i) a change of slope in the energy spectrum going from\napproximately $-2$ to $-3/2$; ii) an increase of the ratio between the wave and\nnonlinear times, with a critical ratio of $\\chi_{c}\\sim0.35$; iii) an absence\nfollowed by a dramatic increase of the communication between Alfv\\'en modes;\nand iv) a modification of the iso-contours of energy revealing a transition\nfrom a purely perpendicular cascade to a cascade compatible with the critical\nbalance type phenomenology. All these changes happen at approximately the same\ntransition scale and therefore can be seen as manifest signatures of the\ntransition from weak to strong wave turbulence.\n", "  The concept of compressive sensing was recently proposed to significantly\nreduce the electron dose in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)\nwhile still maintaining the main features in the image. Here, an experimental\nsetup based on an electromagnetic shutter placed in the condenser plane of a\nSTEM is proposed. The shutter blanks the beam following a random pattern while\nthe scanning coils are moving the beam in the usual scan pattern. Experimental\nimages at both medium scale and high resolution are acquired and then\nreconstructed based on a discrete cosine algorithm. The obtained results\nconfirm the predicted usefulness of compressive sensing in experimental STEM\neven though some remaining artifacts need to be resolved.\n", "  Using exact diagonalization methods we study possible phases in a one\ndimensional model of two differently populated fermionic species in a\nperiodically driven optical lattice. The shaking amplitude and frequency are\nchosen to resonantly drive $s-p$ transition while minimizing the standard\nintraband tunnelings. We numerically verify that in the vicinity of vanishing\nintraband tunnelings the system, for an appropriate filling, shows an emergent\ndensity wave configuration of composites. The majority fermions moving in such\na lattice mimic the celebrated Rice-Mele model. Far away from that region\nstructure changes to clustered phase, with intermediate phase abundantly\npopulated by defects of the density wave. These defects lead to loclaized modes\ncarrying fractional particle charge. The results obtained are compared with\nearlier mean field approximation predictions.\n", "  We investigate the effect of piezoelectric (PZT) material on the flutter\nspeed, vibration mode and frequency, and energy harvesting power and efficiency\nof a flexible flag in various fluids. We develop a fully coupled\nfluid-solid-electric model by combining the inviscid vortex sheet model with a\nlinear electro-mechanical coupling model. A resistance only circuit and a\nresonant resistance-inductance (RL) circuit are considered. For a purely\nresistive circuit, an increased electro-mechanical coupling factor results in\nan increased flutter speed, vibration frequency, averaged electric power and\nefficiency. A consistent optimal resistance is found that maximizes the flutter\nspeed and the energy harvesting power. For a resonant RL circuit, by tuning the\ninductance to match the circuit frequency to the flag's vibration frequency,\nthe flutter speed can be greatly decreased, and a larger averaged power and\nefficiency are obtained. We also consider a model scale set-up with several\ncommonly used commercial materials for operating in air and water. Typical\nranges of dimensionless parameters are obtained for four types of material that\nspan a wide range of solid density and rigidity values. We find that the\nresistance only circuit is more effective when the flag is placed in a lighter\nfluid (e.g. air), while the RL circuit is able to reduce the flutter speed when\nthe flag is placed in a heavier fluid (e.g. water).\n", "  Under increasing compression, an unbuckled shell is in a metastable state\nwhich becomes increasingly precarious as the buckling load is approached. So to\ninduce premature buckling a lateral disturbance will have to overcome a\ndecreasing energy barrier which reaches zero at buckling. Two archetypal\nproblems that exhibit a severe form of this behaviour are the\naxially-compressed cylindrical shell and the externally pressurized spherical\nshell. Focussing on the cylinder, a non-destructive technique was recently\nproposed to estimate the 'shock sensitivity' of a laboratory specimen using a\nlateral probe to measure the nonlinear load-deflection characteristic. If a\nsymmetry-breaking bifurcation is encountered on the path, computer simulations\nshowed how this can be suppressed by a controlled secondary probe. Here, we\nextend our understanding by assessing in general terms how a single control can\ncapture remote saddle solutions: in particular how a symmetric probe could\nlocate an asymmetric solution. Then, more specifically, we analyse the\nspherical shell with point and ring probes, to test the procedure under\nchallenging conditions to assess its range of applicability. Rather than a\nbifurcation, the spherical shell offers the challenge of a de-stabilizing fold\n(limit point) under the rigid control of the probe.\n", "  In the framework of open quantum systems, we study the dynamics of a static\npolarizable two-level atom interacting with a bath of fluctuating vacuum\nelectromagnetic field and explore under which conditions the coherence of the\nopen quantum system is unaffected by the environment totally. For both a\nsingle-qubit and two-qubit systems, we find that the quantum coherence can not\nbe protected from noise when the atom interacts with a non-boundary\nelectromagnetic field. However, with the presence of a boundary, the dynamical\nconditions for the insusceptible of quantum coherence are fulfilled only when\nthe atom is close to the boundary and is transversely polarizable. Otherwise,\nthe quantum coherence can only be protected in some degree in other polarizable\ndirection.\n", "  We investigate the prospects for joint low-latency gravitational wave (GW)\ndetection and prompt electromagnetic (EM) follow-up observations of coalescing\nbinary neutron stars (BNSs). For BNS mergers associated with short duration\ngamma-ray bursts (SGRBs), we for the first time evaluate the feasibility of\nrapid EM follow-ups to capture the prompt emission, early engine activity or\nreveal any potential by-products such as magnetars or fast radio bursts. To\nachieve our goal, we first simulate a population of coalescing BNSs using\nrealistic distributions of source parameters and estimate the detectability and\nlocalisation efficiency at different times before merger. We then use a\nselection of facilities with GW follow-up agreements in place, from\nlow-frequency radio to high energy $\\gamma$-ray to assess the prospects of\nprompt follow-up. We quantify our assessment using observational SGRB flux data\nextrapolated to be within the horizon distances of the advanced GW\ninterferometric detectors LIGO and Virgo and to the prompt phase immediately\nfollowing the binary merger. Our results illustrate that while challenging,\nbreakthrough multi-messenger science is possible with EM follow-up facilities\nwith fast responses and wide fields-of-view. We demonstrate that the\nopportunity to catch the prompt stage ($<$ 5s) of SGRBs, can be enhanced by\nspeeding up the detection pipelines of both GW observatories and EM follow-up\nfacilities. We further show that the addition of an Australian instrument to\nthe optimal detector network could possibly improve the angular resolution by a\nfactor of two and thereby contribute significantly to GW-EM multi-messenger\nastronomy.\n", "  A promising method for real time early warning of gravity driven rupture that\nconsiders both the heterogeneity of natural media and characteristics of\nacoustic emissions attenuation is proposed. The method capitalizes on\nco-detection of elastic waves emanating from micro-cracks by multiple and\nspatially separated sensors. Event co-detection is considered as surrogate for\nlarge event size with more frequent co-detected events marking imminence of\ncatastrophic failure. Using a spatially explicit fiber bundle numerical model\nwith spatially correlated mechanical strength and two load redistribution\nrules, we constructed a range of mechanical failure scenarios and associated\nfailure events (mapped into AE) in space and time. Analysis considering\nhypothetical arrays of sensors and consideration of signal attenuation\ndemonstrate the potential of the co-detection principles even for insensitive\nsensors to provide early warning for imminent global failure.\n", "  In this paper a new idea is presented which is able to predict the scaling\nlaw with the aspect ratio for the toroidal mode number of the so called Single\nHelicity states in Reversed Field Pinch plasmas. The model starts considering\nthe pure electromagnetic interaction of an helical current with a conductive\ntoroidal shell. The stability properties of the plasma become then essential in\ndetermining the emergence of the observed dominant mode.\n", "  This paper explores the dynamics of warm intermediate and logamediate\ninflationary models during weak dissipative regime with a general form of\ndissipative coefficient. We analyze these models within the framework of\nlocally rotationally symmetric Bianchi type I universe. In both cases, we\nevaluate solution of inflaton, effective scalar potential, dissipative\ncoefficient, slow-roll parameters, scalar and tensor power spectra, scalar\nspectral index and tensor to scalar ratio under slow-roll approximation. We\nconstrain the model parameters using recent data and conclude that anisotropic\ninflationary universe model with generalized dissipation coefficient remains\ncompatible with WMAP9, Planck and BICEP2 data.\n", "  We study theories with W-algebra symmetries and their relation to WZNW models\non (super-)groups. Correlation functions of the WZNW models are expressed in\nterms of correlators of CFTs with W-algebra symmetry. The symmetries of the\ntheories involved in these correspondences are related by the Drinfeld-Sokolov\nreduction of Lie algebras to W-algebras. The W-algebras considered in this\npaper are the Bershadsky-Polyakov algebra for sl(3) and the\nquasi-superconformal algebra for generic sl(N|M). The quantum W-algebras\nobtained from affine sl(N) are constructed using embeddings of sl(2) into\nsl(N), and these can in turn be characterized by partitions of N. The above\ncases correspond to \\underline{N+2} = \\underline{2} + N \\underline{1} and its\nsupergroup extension. Finally, sl(2N) and the correspondence corresponding to\n\\underline{2N} = N \\underline{2} is also analyzed.\n", "  In this paper we find the Yangian algebra responsible for the integrability\nof the AdS2 X S2 X T^6 superstring in the planar limit. We demonstrate the\nsymmetry of the corresponding exact S-matrix in the massive sector, including\nthe presence of the secret symmetry. We give two alternative presentations of\nthe Hopf algebra, along with related discussions on the issue of evaluation\nrepresentations. We study the classical r-matrix, and re-discover the need for\na secret symmetry also in this context. Finally, taking the simplifying\nzero-coupling limit of the S-matrix as a generating R-matrix for the Algebraic\nBethe Ansatz, we obtain an effective model of free fermions on a periodic\nspin-chain. This limit should provide hints to the one-loop anomalous dimension\nof the mysterious superconformal quantum mechanics dual to the superstring\ntheory in this geometry.\n", "  Coherent control of individual two-level systems (TLSs) is at the basis of\nany implementation of quantum information. An impressive level of control is\nnow achieved using nuclear, vacancies and charge spins. Manipulation of bright\nexciton transitions in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) is less advanced,\nprincipally due to the sub-nanosecond dephasing. Conversely, owing to their\nrobust coupling to light, one can apply tools of nonlinear spectroscopy to\nachieve all-optical command. Here, we report on the coherent manipulation of an\nexciton via multi-wave mixing. Specifically, we employ three resonant pulses\ndriving a single InAs QD. The first two induce a four-wave mixing (FWM)\ntransient, which is projected onto a six-wave mixing (SWM) depending on the\ndelay and area of the third pulse, in agreement with analytical predictions.\nSuch a switch enables to demonstrate the generation of SWM on a single emitter\nand to engineer the spectro-temporal shape of the coherent response originating\nfrom a TLS. These results pave the way toward multi-pulse manipulations of\nsolid state qubits via implementing the NMR-like control schemes in the optical\ndomain.\n", "  We present a new dynamic off-equilibrium method for the study of continuous\ntransitions, which represents a dynamic generalization of the usual equilibrium\ncumulant method. Its main advantage is that critical parameters are derived\nfrom numerical data obtained much before equilibrium has been attained.\nTherefore, the method is particularly useful for systems with long\nequilibration times, like spin glasses. We apply it to the three-dimensional\nIsing spin-glass model, obtaining accurate estimates of the critical exponents\nand of the critical temperature with a limited computational effort.\n", "  Using a series of carefully constructed numerical experiments based on\nhydrodynamic cosmological SPH simulations, we attempt to build an intuition for\nthe relevant physics behind the large scale density ($b_\\delta$) and velocity\ngradient ($b_\\eta$) biases of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest. Starting with the\nfluctuating Gunn-Peterson approximation applied to the smoothed total density\nfield in real-space, and progressing through redshift-space with no thermal\nbroadening, redshift-space with thermal broadening and hydrodynamicaly\nsimulated baryon fields, we investigate how approximations found in the\nliterature fare. We find that Seljak's 2012 analytical formulae for these bias\nparameters work surprisingly well in the limit of no thermal broadening and\nlinear redshift-space distortions. We also show that his $b_\\eta$ formula is\nexact in the limit of no thermal broadening. Since introduction of thermal\nbroadening significantly affects its value, we speculate that a combination of\nlarge-scale measurements of $b_\\eta$ and the small scale flux PDF might be a\nsensitive probe of the thermal state of the IGM. We find that large-scale\nbiases derived from the smoothed total matter field are within 10-20\\% to those\nbased on hydrodynamical quantities, in line with other measurements in the\nliterature.\n", "  Many current laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) experiments are carried out\nin a regime where the laser pulse length is on the order of or longer than the\nwake wavelength and where ionization injection is employed to inject electrons\ninto the wake. In these experiments, the trapped electrons will co-propagate\nwith the longitudinal wakefield and the transverse laser field. In this\nscenario, the electrons can gain a significant amount of energy from both the\ndirect laser acceleration (DLA) mechanism as well as the usual LWFA mechanism.\nParticle-in-cell (PIC) codes are frequently used to discern the relative\ncontribution of these two mechanisms. However, if the longitudinal resolution\nused in the PIC simulations is inadequate, it can produce numerical heating\nthat can overestimate the transverse motion, which is important in determining\nthe energy gain due to DLA. We have therefore carried out a systematic study of\nthis LWFA regime by varying the longitudinal resolution of PIC simulations from\nthe standard, best-practice resolution of 30 points per laser wavelength to\nfour times that value and then examining the energy gain characteristics of\nboth the highest-energy electrons and the bulk electrons. By calculating the\ncontribution of DLA to the final energies of the electrons produced from the\nLWFA, we find that although the transverse momentum and oscillation radii are\nover-estimated in the lower-resolution simulations, this over-estimation does\nnot lead to artificial energy gain by DLA. Rather, the DLA contribution to the\nhighest-energy electrons is larger in the higher-resolution cases because the\nDLA resonance is better maintained. Thus, even at the highest longitudinal\nresolutions, DLA contributes a significant portion of the energy gained by the\nhighest-energy electrons and also contributes to accelerating the bulk of the\ncharge in the electron beam produced by the LWFA.\n", "  By relating the functional averages of a generic scalar operator in\nsimulations with Open (O) and Periodic (P) boundary conditions (BCs)\nrespectively for $SU(3)$ lattice gauge theory, we show that the scalar glueball\nmass and the glueball to vacuum matrix element can be extracted very\nefficiently from the former. Numerical results are compared with those\nextracted from the two point function of the time slice energy density (both\nPBC and OBC). The scaling properties of the mass and the matrix element are\nstudied with the help of Wilson (gradient) flow.\n", "  The second Tisza-Callen postulate of equilibrium thermodynamics states that\nfor any system exists a function of the system's extensive parameters, called\nentropy, defined for all equilibrium states and having the property that the\nvalues assumed by the extensive parameters in the absence of a constraint are\nthose that maximize the entropy over the manifold of constrained equilibrium\nstates. By analyzing the evolution of systems of positive and negative absolute\ntemperatures, we show that this postulate is satisfied by the Boltzmann formula\nfor the entropy and is violated by the Gibbs formula. Therefore the Gibbs\nformula is not a generally valid expression for the entropy.\n  Viceversa, if we assume, by reductio ad absurdum, that for some thermodynamic\nsystems the equilibrium state is determined by the Gibbs' prescription and not\nby Boltzmann's, this implies that such systems have macroscopic fluctuations\nand therefore do not reach thermodynamic equilibrium.\n", "  Alfv\\'{e}nic turbulent cascade perpendicular and parallel to the background\nmagnetic field is studied accounting for anisotropic dispersive effects and\nturbulent intermittency. The perpendicular dispersion and intermittency make\nthe perpendicular-wavenumber magnetic spectra steeper and speed up production\nof high ion-cyclotron frequencies by the turbulent cascade. On the contrary,\nthe parallel dispersion makes the spectra flatter and decelerate the frequency\ncascade above the ion-cyclotron frequency. Competition of the above factors\nresults in spectral indices distributed in the interval [-2,-3], where -2 is\nthe index of high-frequency space-filling turbulence, and -3 is the index of\nlow-frequency intermittent turbulence formed by tube-like fluctuations. Spectra\nof fully intermittent turbulence fill a narrower range of spectral indices\n[-7/3,-3], which almost coincides with the range of indexes measured in the\nsolar wind. This suggests that the kinetic-scale turbulent spectra are shaped\nmainly by dispersion and intermittency. A small mismatch with measured indexes\nof about 0.1 can be associated with damping effects not studied here.\n", "  Controlling the flow of spin and charge currents in topological insulators\n(TIs) is a crucial requirement for applications in quantum computation and spin\nelectronics. We demonstrate that such control can be established in nanoscopic\ntwo-dimensional TIs by breaking their time reversal symmetry via magnetic\ndefects. This allows for the creation of nearly fully spin-polarized charge\ncurrents, and the design of highly tunable spin diodes. Similar effects can\nalso be realized in mesoscale hybrid structures in which TIs interface with\nferro- or antiferromagnets.\n", "  Most dark matter (DM) models set the DM relic density by some interaction\nwith Standard Model particles. Such models generally assume the existence of\nStandard Model particles early on, with the DM relic density a later\nconsequence of those interactions. Perhaps a more compelling assumption is that\nDM is not part of the Standard Model sector and a population of DM too is\ngenerated at the end of inflation. This democratic assumption does not\nnecessarily provide a natural value for the DM relic density, and superficially\nleads to too much entropy in the dark sector. We address the latter issue by\nthe late decay of heavy particles produced at early times, associating the DM\nrelic density with the lifetime of a long-lived state. We ask what it would\ntake for this scenario to be compatible with observations in what we call\nFlooded Dark Matter (FDM) and discuss several interesting consequences. One is\nthat DM can be very light and furthermore, light DM is in some sense the most\nnatural scenario in FDM as it is compatible with larger couplings of the\ndecaying particle. Moreover, the decay of the field with the smallest coupling\nand hence the longest lifetime dominates the entropy and possibly the matter\ncontent of the Universe, a principle we refer to as 'Maximum Baroqueness'. We\nalso show that the dark sector should be colder than the ordinary sector,\nrelaxing the free-streaming constraints on light DM. We will discuss the\nimplications for the core-cusp problem in a follow-up paper. FDM also has\ninteresting baryogenesis implications. One possibility is that both DM and\nbaryon asymmetries are simultaneously diluted by a late entropy dump.\nAlternatively, FDM is compatible with an elegant non-thermal leptogenesis\nimplementation in which decays of a heavy RH neutrino lead to late time\nreheating of the Standard Model and provide suitable conditions for creation of\na lepton asymmetry.\n", "  The two-point function of exactly marginal operators leads to a universal\ncontribution to the trace anomaly in even dimensions. We study aspects of this\ntrace anomaly, emphasizing its interpretation as a sigma model, whose target\nspace M is the space of conformal field theories (a.k.a. the conformal\nmanifold). When the underlying quantum field theory is supersymmetric, this\nsigma model has to be appropriately supersymmetrized. As examples, we consider\nin some detail N=(2,2) and N=(0,2) supersymmetric theories in d=2 and N=2\nsupersymmetric theories in d=4. This reasoning leads to new information about\nthe conformal manifolds of these theories, for example, we show that the\nmanifold is Kahler-Hodge and we further argue that it has vanishing Kahler\nclass. For N=(2,2) theories in d=2 and N=2 theories in d=4 we also show that\nthe relation between the sphere partition function and the Kahler potential of\nM follows immediately from the appropriate sigma models that we construct.\nAlong the way we find several examples of potential trace anomalies that obey\nthe Wess-Zumino consistency conditions, but can be ruled out by a more detailed\nanalysis.\n", "  The lattice thermal conductivity ($\\kappa_{\\rm L}$) of PbTiO$_3$ (PTO) is\nestimated using a combination of {\\em ab initio} calculations and semiclassical\nBoltzmann transport equation. The computed $\\kappa_{\\rm L}$ is remarkably low,\nnearly comparable with the $\\kappa_{\\rm L}$ of good thermoelectric materials\nsuch as PbTe. In addition, a semiclassical analysis of the electronic transport\nquantities is presented, which suggests excellent thermoelectric properties,\nwith a figure of merit $zT$ well over 1 for a wide range of temperature. For\nthermoelectric applications, the $\\kappa_{\\rm L}$ could be further reduced by\nutilizing different morphologies and compositions.\n", "  We present a study of neutrino/antineutrino induced charged and neutral\ncurrent single pion production off the nucleon. For this, we have considered\n$P_{33}(1232)$ resonance, non-resonant background terms, other higher\nresonances like $P_{11}(1440)$, $S_{11}(1535)$, $D_{13}(1520)$, $S_{11}(1650)$\nand $P_{13}(1720)$. For the non-resonant background terms a microscopic\napproach based on SU(2) non-linear sigma model has been used. The vector form\nfactors for the resonances are obtained by using the relationship between the\nelectromagnetic resonance form factors and helicity amplitudes provided by\nMAID. Axial coupling $C_5^{A}(0)$ in the case of $P_{33}(1232)$ resonance is\nobtained by fitting the ANL and BNL $\\nu$-deuteron reanalyzed scattering data.\nThe results are presented with and without deuteron effect for the total\nscattering cross sections for all possible channels viz.\n$\\nu_l(\\bar\\nu_l)~+~N\\rightarrow l^-(l^+)~+~N^\\prime~+~\\pi^i$;\n$\\nu_l(\\bar\\nu_l)~+~N\\rightarrow \\nu_l(\\bar\\nu_l)~+~N^\\prime~+~\\pi^i$, where\n$N, N^\\prime=p,n$, $\\pi^i=~\\pi^\\pm$ or $\\pi^0$ and $l=e, \\mu$.\n", "  The fact that fast oscillating homogeneous scalar fields behave as perfect\nfluids in average and their intrinsic isotropy have made these models very\nfruitful in cosmology. In this work we will analyse the perturbations dynamics\nin these theories assuming general power law potentials $V(\\phi)=\\lambda\n\\vert\\phi\\vert^{n}/n$. At leading order in the wavenumber expansion, a simple\nexpression for the effective sound speed of perturbations is obtained\n$c_{\\text{eff}}^2 = \\omega=(n-2)/(n+2)$ with $\\omega$ the effective equation of\nstate. We also obtain the first order correction in\n$k^2/\\omega_{\\text{eff}}^2$, when the wavenumber $k$ of the perturbations is\nmuch smaller than the background oscillation frequency, $\\omega_{\\text{eff}}$.\nFor the standard massive case we have also analysed general anharmonic\ncontributions to the effective sound speed. These results are reached through a\nperturbed version of the generalized virial theorem and also studying the exact\nsystem both in the super-Hubble limit, deriving the natural ansatz for\n$\\delta\\phi$; and for sub-Hubble modes, exploiting Floquet's theorem.\n", "  We study the loading of a nonequilibrium, dissipative system of composite\nbosons -- exciton polaritons -- into a one dimensional periodic lattice\npotential. Utilizing momentum resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, we\nobserve a transition between an incoherent Bose gas and a polariton condensate,\nwhich undergoes further transitions between different energy states in the\nband-gap spectrum of the periodic potential with increasing pumping power. We\ndemonstrate controlled loading into distinct energy bands by modifying the size\nand shape of the excitation beam. The observed effects are comprehensively\ndescribed in the framework of a nonequilibrium model of polariton condensation.\nIn particular, we implement a stochastic treatment of quantum and thermal\nfluctuations in the system and confirm that polariton-phonon scattering is a\nkey energy relaxation mechanism enabling transitions from the highly\nnonequilibrium polariton condensate in the gap to the ground band condensation\nfor large pump powers.\n", "  Compact binaries in our galaxy are expected to be one of the main sources of\ngravitational waves for the future eLISA mission. During the mission lifetime,\nmany thousands of galactic binaries should be individually resolved. However,\nthe identification of the sources, and the extraction of the signal parameters\nin a noisy environment are real challenges for data analysis. So far,\nstochastic searches have proven to be the most successful for this problem. In\nthis work we present the first application of a swarm-based algorithm combining\nParticle Swarm Optimization and Differential Evolution. These algorithms have\nbeen shown to converge faster to global solutions on complicated likelihood\nsurfaces than other stochastic methods. We first demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the algorithm for the case of a single binary in a 1 mHz search bandwidth.\nThis interesting problem gave the algorithm plenty of opportunity to fail, as\nit can be easier to find a strong noise peak rather than the signal itself.\nAfter a successful detection of a fictitious low-frequency source, as well as\nthe verification binary RXJ0806.3+1527, we then applied the algorithm to the\ndetection of multiple binaries, over different search bandwidths, in the cases\nof low and mild source confusion. In all cases, we show that we can\nsuccessfully identify the sources, and recover the true parameters within a\n99\\% credible interval.\n", "  We present time-of-fight neutron-scattering measurements on single crystals\nof $La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4}$ (LBCO) with 0 $\\leq$ x $\\leq$ 0.095 and\n$La_{2-x}Sr_{x}CuO_{4}$ (LSCO) with x = 0.08 and 0.11. This range of dopings\nspans much of the phase diagram relevant to high temperature cuprate\nsuperconductivity, ranging from insulating, three dimensional (3D) commensurate\nlong range antiferromagnetic order, for x $\\leq$ 0.02, to two dimensional (2D)\nincommensurate antiferromagnetism co-existing with superconductivity for x\n$\\geq$ 0.05. Previous work on lightly doped LBCO with x = 0.035 showed a clear\nresonant enhancement of the inelastic scattering coincident with the low energy\ncrossings of the highly dispersive spin excitations and quasi-2D optic phonons.\nThe present work extends these measurements across the phase diagram and shows\nthis enhancement to be a common feature to this family of layered quantum\nmagnets. Furthermore we show that the low temperature, low energy magnetic\nspectral weight is substantially larger for samples with non-superconducting\nground states relative to any of the samples with superconducting ground\nstates. Spin gaps, suppression of low energy magnetic spectral weight as a\nfunction of decreasing temperature, are observed in both superconducting LBCO\nand LSCO samples, consistent with previous observations for superconducting\nLSCO.\n", "  The goal of this work is threefold. First, we give an expression of the most\ngeneral five point integral on M_{0,n} in terms of Chebyshev polynomials.\nSecond, we choose a special kinematics that transforms the polynomial form of\nthe scattering equations to a linear system of symmetric polynomials. We then\nexplain how this can be used to explicitly evaluate arbitrary point integrals\non M_{0,n}. Third, we comment on the recently presented method of companion\nmatrices and we show its equivalence to the elimination theory and an algorithm\npreviously developed by one of the authors.\n", "  The proposal of generating high quality electron bunches via ionization\ninjection triggered by an counter propagating laser pulse inside a beam driven\nplasma wake is examined via two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. It is\nshown that electron bunches obtained using this technique can have extremely\nsmall slice energy spread, because each slice is mainly composed of electrons\nionized at the same time. Another remarkable advantage is that the injection\ndistance is changeable. A bunch with normalized emittance of 3.3 nm, slice\nenergy spread of 15 keV and brightness of $7.2\\times 10^{18}$ A m$^{-2}$\nrad$^{-2}$ is obtained with an optimal injection length which is achieved by\nadjusting the launch time of the drive beam or by changing the laser focal\nposition. This makes the scheme a promising approach to generate high quality\nelectron bunches for the fifth generation light source.\n", "  We use a holographic theory to model and study the competition of four\nphases: an antiferromagnetic phase, a superconducting phase, a metallic phase\nand a striped phase, using as control parameters temperature and a doping-like\nparameter. We analyse the various instabilities and determine the possible\nphases. One class of phase diagrams, that we analyse in detail, is similar to\nthat of high-temperature superconductors as well as other strange metal\nmaterials.\n", "  Employing a conformal map to hyperbolic space cross a circle, we compute the\nuniversal contribution to the vacuum entanglement entropy (EE) across a sphere\nin even-dimensional conformal field theory. Previous attempts to derive the EE\nin this way were hindered by a lack of knowledge of the appropriate boundary\nterms in the trace anomaly. In this paper we show that the universal part of\nthe EE can be treated as a purely boundary effect. As a byproduct of our\ncomputation, we derive an explicit form for the A-type anomaly contribution to\nthe Wess-Zumino term for the trace anomaly, now including boundary terms. In\nd=4 and 6, these boundary terms generalize earlier bulk actions derived in the\nliterature.\n", "  We show that pronounced modulations in spin and charge densities can be\ninduced by the insertion of a single hole in an otherwise half-filled 2-leg\nHubbard ladder. Accompanied with these modulations is a loosely bound structure\nof the doped charge with a spin-1/2, in contrast to the tightly bound case\nwhere such modulations are absent. These behaviors are caused by the\ninterference of the Berry phases associated a string of flipped spins (or\n\"phase strings\") left behind as a hole travels through a spin bath with a\nshort-range anti-ferromagnetic order. The key role of the phase strings is also\nreflected in how the system respond to increasing spin polarization, increasing\nthe on-site repulsion, addition of a second hole, and increasing asymmetry\nbetween intra- and inter-chain hopping. Remarkably, all these properties\npersist down to ladders as short as $\\sim 10$ sites. They can therefore be\nstudied in cold atom experiments using the recently developed fermion\nmicroscope.\n", "  Quantum chromodynamics and the electroweak theory at low energies are\nprominent instances of the combination of a short-range and a long-range\ninteraction. For the description of light nuclei, the large nucleon-nucleon\nscattering lengths produced by the strong interaction, and the reduction of the\nweak interaction to the Coulomb potential, play a crucial role. Helium-3 is the\nfirst bound nucleus comprised of more than one proton in which this combination\nof forces can be studied.\n  We demonstrate a proper renormalization of Helium-3 using the pionless\neffective field theory as the formal representation of the nuclear regime as\nstrongly interacting fermions. The theory is found consistent at leading and\nnext-to-leading order without isospin-symmetry-breaking 3-nucleon interactions\nand a non-perturbative treatment of the Coulomb interaction. The conclusion\nhighlights the significance of the regularization method since a comparison to\nprevious work is contradictory if the difference in those methods is not\nconsidered.\n  With a perturbative Coulomb interaction, as suggested by dimensional\nanalysis, we find the Helium-3 system properly renormalized, too.\n  For both treatments, renormalization-scheme independence of the effective\nfield theory is demonstrated by regulating the potential and a variation of the\nassociated cutoff.\n", "  Optical searches assisted by the field of a laser pulse might allow for\nexploring a variety of not yet detected dark matter candidates such as\nhidden-photons and scalar minicharged particles. These hypothetical degrees of\nfreedom may be understood as a natural consequence of extensions of the\nStandard Model incorporating a hidden $\\rm U(1)$-gauge sector. In this paper,\nwe study the effects induced by both candidates on the propagation of a probe\nelectromagnetic waves in the vacuum polarized by a long laser pulse of moderate\nintensity, this way complementing our previous study [JHEP \\textbf{06}, $177$\n($2015$)]. We describe how the absence of a spin in the scalar charged carriers\nmodifies the photon-paraphoton oscillations as compared with a fermionic\nminicharge model. In particular, we find that the regime close to their lowest\nthreshold mass might provide the most stringent upper limit for minicharged\nscalars. The pure-laser based experiment investigated here could allow 23for\nexcluding a sector in the parameter space of the particles which has not been\nexperimentally ruled out by setups driven by dipole magnets. We explain how the\nsign of the ellipticity and rotation of the polarization plane acquired by a\nprobe photon--in combination with their dependencies on the pulse\nparameters--can be exploited to elucidate the quantum statistics of the charge\ncarriers.\n", "  The German-British laser-interferometric gravitational wave detector GEO 600\nis in its 14th year of operation since its first lock in 2001. After GEO 600\nparticipated in science runs with other first-generation detectors, a program\nknown as GEO-HF began in 2009. The goal was to improve the detector sensitivity\nat high frequencies, around 1 kHz and above, with technologically advanced yet\nminimally invasive upgrades. Simultaneously, the detector would record science\nquality data in between commissioning activities. As of early 2014, all of the\nplanned upgrades have been carried out and sensitivity improvements of up to a\nfactor of four at the high-frequency end of the observation band have been\nachieved. Besides science data collection, an experimental program is ongoing\nwith the goal to further improve the sensitivity and evaluate future detector\ntechnologies. We summarize the results of the GEO-HF program to date and\ndiscuss its successes and challenges.\n", "  In this work, we explore an extension of Hilbert series techniques to count\noperators that include derivatives. For sufficiently low-derivative operators,\nwe find an algorithm that gives the number of invariant operators, properly\naccounting for redundancies due to the equations of motion and integration by\nparts. Specifically, the technique can be applied whenever there is only one\nLorentz invariant for a given partitioning of derivatives among the fields. At\nhigher numbers of derivatives, equation of motion redundancies can be removed,\nbut the increased number of Lorentz contractions spoils the subtraction of\nintegration by parts redundancies. While restricted, this technique is\nsufficient to automatically generate the complete set of invariant operators of\nthe Standard Model effective field theory for dimensions 6 and 7 (for arbitrary\nnumbers of flavors). At dimension 8, the algorithm does not automatically\ngenerate the complete operator set; however, it suffices for all but five\nclasses of operators. For these remaining classes, there is a well defined\nprocedure to manually determine the number of invariants. Using these methods,\nwe thereby derive the set of 535 dimension-8 $N_f = 1$ operators.\n", "  We present updated predictions for the cross-sections for pair production of\nsquarks and gluinos at the LHC Run II. First of all, we update the calculations\nbased on NLO+NLL partonic cross-sections by using the NNPDF3.0NLO global\nanalysis. This study includes a full characterization of theoretical\nuncertainties from higher orders, PDFs and the strong coupling. Then, we\nexplore the implications for this calculation of the recent NNPDF3.0 PDFs with\nNLO+NLL threshold resummation. We find that the shift in the results induced by\nthe threshold-improved PDFs is within the total theory uncertainty band of the\ncalculation based on NLO PDFs. However, we also observe that the central values\nof the cross-sections are modified both in a qualitative and a quantitative\nway, illustrating the relevance and impact of using threshold-improved PDFs\ntogether with resummed partonic cross-sections. The updated NLO+NLL\ncross-sections based on NNPDF3.0NLO are publicly available in the NLL-fast\nformat, and should be an important ingredient for the interpretation of the\nsearches for supersymmetric particles at Run II.\n", "  We analyze the partition function of the Ising model on graphs of two\ndifferent types: complete graphs, wherein all nodes are mutually linked and\nannealed scale-free networks for which the degree distribution decays as\n$P(k)\\sim k^{-\\lambda}$. We are interested in zeros of the partition function\nin the cases of complex temperature or complex external field (Fisher and\nLee-Yang zeros respectively). For the model on an annealed scale-free network,\nwe find an integral representation for the partition function which, in the\ncase $\\lambda > 5$, reproduces the zeros for the Ising model on a complete\ngraph. For $3<\\lambda < 5$ we derive the $\\lambda$-dependent angle at which the\nFisher zeros impact onto the real temperature axis. This, in turn, gives access\nto the $\\lambda$-dependent universal values of the critical exponents and\ncritical amplitudes ratios. Our analysis of the Lee-Yang zeros reveals a\ndifference in their behaviour for the Ising model on a complete graph and on an\nannealed scale-free network when $3<\\lambda <5$. Whereas in the former case the\nzeros are purely imaginary, they have a non zero real part in latter case, so\nthat the celebrated Lee-Yang circle theorem is violated.\n", "  We propose a method to sample stationary properties of solutions of\nstochastic differential equations, which is accurate and efficient if there are\nrarely visited regions or rare transitions between distinct regions of the\nstate space. The method is based on a complete, non-overlapping partition of\nthe state space into patches on which the stochastic process is ergodic. On\neach of these patches we run simulations of the process strictly truncated to\nthe corresponding patch, which allows effective simulations also in rarely\nvisited regions. The correct weight for each patch is obtained by counting the\nattempted transitions between all different patches. The results are\npatchworked to cover the whole state space. We extend the concept of truncated\nMarkov chains which is originally formulated for processes which obey detailed\nbalance to processes not fulfilling detailed balance. The method is illustrated\nby three examples, describing the one-dimensional diffusion of an overdamped\nparticle in a double-well potential, a system of many globally coupled\noverdamped particles in double-well potentials subject to additive Gaussian\nwhite noise, and the overdamped motion of a particle on the circle in a\nperiodic potential subject to a deterministic drift and additive noise. In the\nappendix we explain how other well-known Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms\ncan be related to truncated Markov chains.\n", "  We report on the formation of critical states in disordered graphene, at the\norigin of variable and unconventional transport properties in the quantum Hall\nregime, such as a zero-energy Hall conductance plateau in the absence of an\nenergy bandgap and Landau level degeneracy breaking. By using efficient\nreal-space transport methodologies, we compute both the dissipative and Hall\nconductivities of large size graphene sheets with random distribution of model\nsingle and double vacancies. By analyzing the scaling of transport coefficients\nwith defect density, system size and magnetic length, we elucidate the origin\nof anomalous quantum Hall features as magnetic-field dependent impurity states,\nwhich percolate at some critical energies. These findings shed light on\nunidentified states and quantum transport anomalies reported experimentally.\n", "  We demonstrate and evaluate an on-demand source of single itinerant microwave\nphotons. Photons are generated using a highly coherent, fixed-frequency\nqubit-cavity system, and a protocol where the microwave control field is far\ndetuned from the photon emission frequency. By using a Josephson parametric\namplifier (JPA), we perform efficient single-quadrature detection of the state\nemerging from the cavity. We characterize the imperfections of the photon\ngeneration and detection, including detection inefficiency and state infidelity\ncaused by measurement backaction over a range of JPA gains from 17 to 33 dB. We\nobserve that both detection efficiency and undesirable backaction increase with\nJPA gain. We find that the density matrix has its maximum single photon\ncomponent $\\rho_{11} = 0.36 \\pm 0.01$ at 29 dB JPA gain. At this gain,\nbackaction of the JPA creates cavity photon number fluctuations that we model\nas a thermal distribution with an average photon number $\\bar{n} = 0.041 \\pm\n0.003$.\n", "  We study the electroweak vacuum stability in Type I seesaw models for 3\ngenerations of neutrinos in scenarios where the right-handed neutrinos have\nexplicit bare mass terms in the Lagrangian and where these are dynamically\ngenerated through the mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking. To best\nhighlight the difference of the two cases we concentrate on the absolute\nstability of the scalar potential. We observe that for the first scenario, the\nscale at which the scalar potential becomes unstable is lower from that within\nthe Standard Model. In addition the Yukawa couplings $\\mathbf{Y}_\\nu$ are\nconstrained such that $\\Tr{[\\mathbf{Y}^{\\dagger}_\\nu \\mathbf{Y}_{\\nu}}]\n\\lesssim10^{-3}$. In the second scenario the electroweak stability can be\nimproved in a large region of parameter space. However, we found that the\nscalar used to break the lepton number symmetry cannot be too light and have a\nlarge coupling to right-handed neutrinos in order for the seesaw mechanism to\nbe a valid mechanism for neutrino mass generation. In this case we have $\\Tr\n[\\mathbf{Y}^\\dagger_{\\nu} \\mathbf{Y}_\\nu]\\lesssim 0.01$.\n", "  Photocurrent measurements provide a powerful means of studying the spatially\nresolved optoelectronic and electrical properties of a material or device.\nGenerally speaking there are two classes of mechanism for photocurrent\ngeneration: those involving separation of electrons and holes, and\nthermoelectric effects driven by electron temperature gradients. Here we\nintroduce a new member in the latter class: the photo-Nernst effect. In\ngraphene devices in a perpendicular magnetic field we observe photocurrent\ngenerated uniformly along the free edges, with opposite sign at opposite edges.\nThe signal is antisymmetric in field, shows a peak versus gate voltage at the\nneutrality point flanked by wings of opposite sign at low fields, and exhibits\nquantum oscillations at higher fields. These features are all explained by the\nNernst effect associated with laser-induced electron heating. This photo-Nernst\ncurrent provides a simple and clear demonstration of the Shockley-Ramo nature\nof long-range photocurrent generation in a gapless material.\n", "  Wirelessly connected vehicles that exchange information about traffic\nconditions can reduce delays caused by congestion. At a 2-to-1 lane reduction,\nthe improvement in flow past a bottleneck due to traffic with a random mixture\nof 40% connected vehicles is found to be 52%. Control is based on\nconnected-vehicle-reported velocities near the bottleneck. In response to\nindications of congestion the connected vehicles, which are also adaptive\ncruise control vehicles, reduce their speed in slowdown regions. Early lane\nchanges of manually driven vehicles from the terminated lane to the continuous\nlane are induced by the slowing connected vehicles. Self-organized congestion\nat the bottleneck is thus delayed or eliminated, depending upon the incoming\nflow magnitude. For the large majority of vehicles, travel times past the\nbottleneck are substantially reduced. Control is responsible for delaying the\nonset of congestion as the incoming flow increases. Adaptive cruise control\nincreases the flow out of the congested state at the bottleneck. The nature of\nthe congested state, when it occurs, appears to be similar under a variety of\nconditions. Typically 80-100 vehicles are approximately equally distributed\nbetween the lanes in the 500-m region prior to the end of the terminated lane.\nWithout the adaptive cruise control capability, connected vehicles can delay\nthe onset of congestion but do not increase the asymptotic flow past the\nbottleneck. Calculations are done using the Kerner-Klenov stochastic\ndiscrete-time model for manual vehicles. The dynamics of the connected vehicles\nis given by a conventional adaptive cruise control algorithm plus commanded\ndeceleration. Because time in the model for manual vehicles is discrete\n(one-second intervals), it is assumed that the acceleration of any vehicle\nimmediately in front of a connected vehicle is constant during the time\ninterval.\n", "  Plasma boundary layers are susceptible to electrostatic instabilities driven\nby ion flows in presheaths and, when present, these instabilities can influence\ntransport. In plasmas with a single species of positive ion, ion-acoustic\ninstabilities are expected under conditions of low pressure and large\nelectron-to-ion temperature ratio ($T_e/T_i \\gg 1$). In plasmas with two\nspecies of positive ions, ion-ion two-stream instabilities can also be excited.\nThe stability phase-space is characterized using the Penrose criterion and\napproximate linear dispersion relations. Predictions for how these\ninstabilities affect ion and electron transport in presheaths, including rapid\nthermalization due to instability-enhanced collisions and an\ninstability-enhanced ion-ion friction force, are also briefly reviewed. Recent\nexperimental tests of these predictions are discussed along with research needs\nrequired for further validation. The calculated stability boundaries provide a\nguide to determine the experimental conditions at which these effects can be\nexpected.\n", "  We present evidence for nuclear spin-lattice relaxation driven by glassy\nnematic fluctuations in isovalent P-doped BaFe$_2$As$_2$ single crystals. Both\nthe $^{75}$As and $^{31}$P sites exhibit stretched-exponential relaxation\nsimilar to the electron-doped systems. By comparing the hyperfine fields and\nthe relaxation rates at these sites we find that the As relaxation cannot be\nexplained solely in terms of magnetic spin fluctuations. We demonstrate that\nnematic fluctuations couple to the As nuclear quadrupolar moment and can\nexplain the excess relaxation. These results suggest that glassy nematic\ndynamics are a universal phenomenon in the iron-based superconductors.\n", "  The development of a directional, small-divergence, and short-duration\npicosecond x-ray probe beam with an energy greater than 50 keV is desirable for\nhigh energy density science experiments. We therefore explore through\nparticle-in-cell (PIC) computer simulations the possibility of using x-rays\nradiated by betatron-like motion of electrons from a self-modulated laser\nwakefield accelerator as a possible candidate to meet this need. Two OSIRIS 2D\nPIC simulations with mobile ions are presented, one with a normalized vector\npotential a0 = 1.5 and the other with an a0 = 3. We find that in both cases\ndirect laser acceleration (DLA) is an important additional acceleration\nmechanism in addition to the longitudinal electric field of the plasma wave.\nTogether these mechanisms produce electrons with a continuous energy spectrum\nwith a maximum energy of 300 MeV for a0 = 3 case and 180 MeV in the a0 = 1.5\ncase. Forward-directed x-ray radiation with a photon energy up to 100 keV was\ncalculated for the a0 = 3 case and up to 12 keV for the a0 = 1.5 case. The\nx-ray spectrum can be fitted with a sum of two synchrotron spectra with\ncritical photon energy of 13 and 45 keV for the a0 of 3 and critical photon\nenergy of 0.3 and 1.4 keV for a0 of 1.5 in the plane of polarization of the\nlaser. The full width at half maximum divergence angle of the x-rays was 62 x\n1.9 mrad for a0 = 3 and 77 x 3.8 mrad for a0 = 1.5.\n", "  To obtain the initial pressure from the collected data on a planar sensor\narrangement in photoacoustic tomography, there exists an exact analytic\nfrequency domain reconstruction formula. An efficient realization of this\nformula needs to cope with the evaluation of the data's Fourier transform on a\nnon-equispaced mesh. In this paper, we use the non-uniform fast Fourier\ntransform to handle this issue and show its feasibility in 3D experiments with\nreal and synthetic data. This is done in comparison to the standard approach\nthat uses linear, polynomial or nearest neighbor interpolation. Moreover, we\ninvestigate the effect and the utility of flexible sensor location to make\noptimal use of a limited number of sensor points. The computational realization\nis accomplished by the use of a multi-dimensional non-uniform fast Fourier\nalgorithm, where non-uniform data sampling is performed both in frequency and\nspatial domain. Examples with synthetic and real data show that both approaches\nimprove image quality.\n", "  We investigate the quasi-static magnetic behavior of ensembles of\nnon-interacting ferromagnetic nanoparticles consisting of MnP nanoclusters\nembedded in GaP(001) epilayers grown at 600, 650 and 700{\\deg}C. We use a\nphenomenological model, in which surface effects are included, to reproduce the\nexperimental hysteresis curves measured as a function of temperature (120-260\nK) and direction of the applied field. The slope of the hysteresis curve during\nmagnetization reversal is determined by the MnP nanoclusters size distribution,\nwhich is a function of the growth temperature. Our results show that the\ncoercive field is very sensitive to the strength of the surface anisotropy,\nwhich reduces the energy barrier between the two states of opposite\nmagnetization. Notably, this reduction in the energy barrier increases by a\nfactor of 3 as the sample temperature is lowered from 260 to 120 K.\n", "  The DG algorithm is a powerful method for solving pdes, especially for\nevolution equations in conservation form. Since the algorithm involves\nintegration over volume elements, it is not immediately obvious that it will\ngeneralize easily to arbitrary time-dependent curved spacetimes. We show how to\nformulate the algorithm in such spacetimes for applications in relativistic\nastrophysics. We also show how to formulate the algorithm for equations in\nnon-conservative form, such as Einstein's field equations themselves. We find\ntwo computationally distinct formulations in both cases, one of which has\nseldom been used before for flat space in curvilinear coordinates but which may\nbe more efficient. We also give a new derivation of the ALE algorithm\n(Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian) using 4-vector methods that is much simpler\nthan the usual derivation and explains why the method preserves the\nconservation form of the equations. The various formulations are explored with\nsome simple numerical experiments that also explore the effect of the metric\nidentities on the results.\n", "  Within the linear response of polycrystalline magnetic films to electric\ncurrents, a general analysis predicts three new galvanomagnetic effects\noriginated from the two-dimensional nature of the films. These new\ngalvanomagnetic effects, which differ from the conventional extraordinary Hall\neffect and anisotropic magnetoresistance, are follows. 1) The longitudinal\nresistivity depends linearly on the magnetization component perpendicular to a\nfilm. 2) A current parallel to the magnetization can generate an electric field\nin the vertical direction of a film. 3) A current perpendicular to a film can\ngenerate an electric field along the magnetization direction.\n", "  Basso, Komatsu and Vieira recently proposed an all-loop framework for the\ncomputation of three-point functions of single-trace operators of ${\\cal N}=4$\nsuper-Yang-Mills, the \"hexagon program\". This proposal results in several\nremarkable predictions, including the three-point function of two protected\noperators with an unprotected one in the $SU(2)$ and $SL(2)$ sectors. Such\npredictions consist of an \"asymptotic\" part---similar in spirit to the\nasymptotic Bethe Ansatz of Beisert and Staudacher for two-point functions---as\nwell as additional finite-size \"wrapping\" L\\\"uscher-like corrections. The focus\nof this paper is on such wrapping corrections, which we compute at three-loops\nin the $SL(2)$ sector. The resulting structure constants perfectly match the\nones obtained in the literature from four-point correlators of protected\noperators.\n", "  Ionization injection in a plasma wakefield accelerator was investigated\nexperimentally using two lithium plasma sources of different lengths. The\nionization of the helium gas, used to confine the lithium, injects electrons in\nthe wake. After acceleration, these injected electrons were observed as a\ndistinct group from the drive beam on the energy spectrometer. They typically\nhave a charge of tens of pC, an energy spread of a few GeV, and a maximum\nenergy of up to 30 GeV. The emittance of this group of electrons can be many\ntimes smaller than the initial emittance of the drive beam. The energy scaling\nfor the trapped charge from one plasma length to the other is consistent with\nthe blowout theory of the plasma wakefield.\n", "  Using ab-initio non-Born-Oppenheimer simulations, we demonstrate\namplification of XUV radiation in a high-harmonic generation type process using\nthe example of the hydrogen molecular ion. A small fraction of the molecules is\npumped to a dissociative Rydberg state from which IR-assisted XUV amplification\nis observed. We show that starting at sufficiently high IR driving field\nintensities the ground state molecules become quasi-transparent for XUV\nradiation, while due to stabilization gain from Rydberg states is maintained,\nthus leading to lasing from strongly driven Rydberg states. Further increase of\nthe IR intensity even leads to gain by initially unexcited molecules, which are\nquickly excited by the driving IR pulse.\n", "  We address the question of whether massive red and blue galaxies trace the\nsame large-scale structure at z~0.6 using the CMASS sample of galaxies from\nData Release 12 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. After splitting the\ncatalog into subsamples of red and blue galaxies using a simple colour cut, we\nmeasure the clustering of both subsamples and construct the correlation\ncoefficient, r, using two statistics. The correlation coefficient quantifies\nthe stochasticity between the two subsamples, which we examine over\nintermediate scales (20 < R < 100 Mpc/h). We find that on these intermediate\nscales, the correlation coefficient is consistent with 1; in particular, we\nfind r > 0.95 taking into account both statistics and r > 0.974 using the\nfavored statistic.\n", "  The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), the last member of Hall family, was\npredicted to exhibit quantized Hall conductivity e2/h without any external\nmagnetic field. The QAHE shares a similar physical phenomenon with the integer\nquantum Hall effect (QHE), whereas its physical origin relies on the intrinsic\ntopological inverted band structure and ferromagnetism. Since the QAHE does not\nrequire external energy input in the form of magnetic field, it is believed\nthat this effect has unique potential for applications in future electronic\ndevices with low-power consumption. More recently, the QAHE has been\nexperimentally observed in thin films of the time-reversal symmetry breaking\nferromagnetic (FM) topological insulators (TI), Cr- and V- doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3.\nIn this Topical Review, we review the history of TI based QAHE, the route to\nthe experimental observation of the QAHE in the above two systems, the current\nstatus of the research of the QAHE, and finally the prospects for future\nstudies.\n", "  We study the embedding of the monodromy inflation mechanism by E. Silverstein\nand A. Westphal (2008) in a concrete compactification setting. To that end, we\nlook for an appropriate vacuum of type IIA supergravity, corresponding to the\nminimum of the inflaton potential. We prove a no-go theorem on the existence of\nsuch a vacuum, using ten-dimensional equations of motion. Anti-de Sitter and\nMinkowski vacua are ruled out; de Sitter vacua are not excluded, but have a\nlower bound on their cosmological constant which is too high for phenomenology.\n", "  Continuing the work arXiv:1504.05991, we discuss various aspects of three\ndimensional quantum gravity partition function in AdS in the semi-classical\nlimit. The partition function is holomorphic and is the one which we obtained\nby using the localization technique of Chern-Simons theory in arXiv:1504.05991.\nWe obtain a good expression for it in the summation form over Virasoro\ncharacters for the vacuum and primaries. A key ingredient for that is an\ninterpretation of boundary localized fermion. We also check that the\ncoefficients in the summation form over Virasoro characters of the partition\nfunction are positive integers and satisfy the Cardy formula. These give\nphysical interpretation that these coefficients represent the number of primary\nfields in the dual CFT in the large k limit.\n", "  We theoretically propose that the Dirac fermion in two-dimensions shows the\ngiant nonlinear responses to electromagnetic fields in terahertz region. A\nscaling form is obtained for the current and magnetization as functions of the\nnormalized electromagnetic fields $E/E_\\omega$ and $B/B_\\omega$, where the\ncharacteristic electric (magnetic) field $E_\\omega$ ($B_\\omega$) depends on the\nfrequency $\\omega$ as $\\hbar\\omega^2/ev_F$ ($\\hbar\\omega^2/ev_F^2$), and is\ntypically of the order of 80 V/cm ( 8 mT) in the terahertz region. Applications\nof the present theory to graphene and surface state of a topological insulator\nare discussed.\n", "  We study the effective theory of slowly rotating black holes at the infinite\nlimit of the spacetime dimension D. This large D effective theory is obtained\nby integrating the Einstein equation with respect to the radial direction. The\neffective theory gives equations for non-linear dynamical deformations of the\nslowly rotating black hole as effective equations. The effective equations\ncontain the slowly rotating Myers-Perry black hole, slowly boosted black\nstring, non-uniform black string and black ring as stationary solutions. We\nobtain an analytic solution of the black ring by solving the effective\nequations. Furthermore, by perturbation analysis of the effective equations, we\nfind a quasinormal mode condition of the black ring in analytic way. As a\nresult we confirm that thin black ring is unstable against non-axisymmetric\nperturbations. We also include 1/D corrections to the effective equations and\ndiscuss the effects by 1/D corrections.\n", "  We outline a separable matrix ansatz for the potentials in effective field\ntheories of nonrelativistic two-body systems with short-range interactions. We\nuse this ansatz to construct new fixed points of the renormalisation-group\nequation for these potentials. New fixed points indicate a much richer\nstructure than previously recognized in the RG flows of simple short-range\npotentials.\n", "  We analyze the interplay of adiabatic rotation and Rashba spin-orbit coupling\non the BCS-BEC evolution of a harmonically-trapped Fermi gas in two dimensions\nunder the assumption that vortices are not excited. First, by taking the\ntrapping potential into account via both the semi-classical and exact\nquantum-mechanical approaches, we firmly establish the parameter regime where\nthe non-interacting gas forms a ring-shaped annulus. Then, by taking the\ninteractions into account via the BCS mean-field approximation, we study the\npair-breaking mechanism that is induced by rotation, i.e., the Coriolis\neffects. In particular, we show that the interplay allows for the possibility\nof creating either an isolated annulus of rigidly-rotating normal particles\nthat is disconnected from the central core of non-rotating superfluid pairs or\nan intermediate mediator phase where the superfluid pairs and normal particles\ncoexist as a partially-rotating gapless superfluid.\n", "  The limits of the areal storage density as can be achieved with heat assisted\nmagnetic recording (HAMR) are still an open issue. We want to address this\ncentral question and present the design of a possible bit patterned medium with\nan areal storage density above 10 Tb/in$^2$. The model uses hard magnetic\nrecording grains with 5 nm diameter and 10 nm height. It assumes a realistic\ndistribution of the Curie temperature of the underlying material as well as a\nrealistic distribution of the grain size and the grain position. In order to\ncompute the areal density we analyze the detailed switching behavior of a\nrecording bit under different external conditions, which allows to compute the\nbit error rate of a recording process (shingled and conventional) for different\ngrain spacings and write head positions. Hence, we are able to optimize the\nareal density of the presented medium.\n", "  We focus on the question of how relativistic fluid dynamics should be thought\nof as a Wilsonian effective field theory emerging from Schwinger-Keldysh path\nintegrals. Taking the basic principles of Schwinger-Keldysh formalism\nseriously, we are led to a series of remarkable statements and conjectures,\nwhich we phrase in terms of a broad programme relating relativistic fluid\ndynamics and topological sigma models. Apart from the intrinsic interest for\nthese ideas from the non-equilibrium field theory viewpoint, we also emphasize\nits relevance to various fundamental questions in black hole physics.\n", "  We describe basics of a new approach to transverse momentum dependence in\nhard exclusive processes. We develop it in application to the transition\nprocess \\gamma^* \\gamma -> \\pi^0 at the handbag level. Our starting point is\ncoordinate representation for matrix elements of operators (in the simplest\ncase, bilocal O (0,z) ) describing a hadron with momentum p. Treated as\nfunctions of (pz) and z^2, they are parametrized through virtuality\ndistribution amplitudes (VDA) \\Phi (x, \\sigma), with x being Fourier-conjugate\nto (pz) and \\sigma Laplace-conjugate to z^2. For intervals with z^+=0, we\nintroduce the transverse momentum distribution amplitude (TMDA) \\Psi (x,\nk_\\perp), and write it in terms of VDA \\Phi (x, \\sigma). The results of\ncovariant calculations, written in terms of \\Phi (x, \\sigma) are converted into\nexpressions involving \\Psi (x, k_\\perp). Starting with scalar toy models, we\nextend the analysis onto the case of spin-1/2 quarks and QCD. We propose simple\nmodels for soft VDAs/TMDAs, and use them for comparison of handbag results with\nexperimental (BaBar and BELLE) data on the pion transition form factor. We also\ndiscuss how one can generate high-k_\\perp tails from primordial soft\ndistributions.\n", "  In this paper, we provide a procedure to calculate the bremsstrahlung\nspectrum for virtually any relativistic bare ion with charge 6$e$ or beyond,\n$Z\\ge 6$, in ultraperipheral collisions with target nuclei. We apply the\nWeizs\\\"{a}cker-Williams method of virtual quanta to model the effect of the\ndistribution of nuclear constituents on the interaction of the ion with the\nradiation target. This leads to a bremsstrahlung spectrum peaking at $2\\gamma$\ntimes the energy of the giant dipole resonance ($\\gamma$ is the projectile\nenergy in units of its rest energy). A central ingredient in the calculation is\nthe cross section for elastic scattering of photons on the ion. This is only\navailable in the literature for a few selected nuclei and, usually, only in a\nrather restricted parameter range. Hence we develop a procedure applicable for\nall $Z\\geq6$ to estimate the elastic scattering. The elastic cross section is\nobtained at low to moderate photon energies, somewhat beyond the giant dipole\nresonance, by means of the optical theorem, a dispersion relation, and data on\nthe total absorption cross section. The cross section is continued at higher\nenergies by invoking depletion due to loss of coherence in the scattering. Our\nprocedure is intended for any ion where absorption data is available and for\nmoderate to high energies, $\\gamma \\gtrsim 10$.\n", "  We discuss the quantum phase transition from the Mott-insulator state to the\ndensity-wave state for cold Bose atoms in a 2D square lattice as the lattice is\nadiabatically tilted along one of its primary axes. It is shown that a small\nmisalignment of the tilt drastically changes the result of the adiabatic\npassage and, instead of the density-wave state, one obtains a disordered state.\nIntrinsic relation of the problem to Bloch oscillations of hard-core bosons in\na 2D lattice is illuminated.\n", "  It is shown that the Jacobi and Riemann identities of degree four for the\nmultidimensional theta functions as well as the Weierstrass identities emerge\nas algebraic consequences of the fundamental multidimensional binary identities\nconnecting the theta functions with Riemann matrices $\\tau$ and $2\\tau$.\n", "  Sensing in the presence of environmental noise is a problem of increasing\npractical interest. In a master equation description, where the state of the\nenvironment is unobserved, the effect of signal and noise is described by\nsystem operators only. In this context it is well-known that noise that is\northogonal on an external signal can be corrected for without perturbing the\nsignal, while similarly efficient strategies for non-orthogonal signal and\nnoise operators are not known. Here we make use of the fact that\nsystem-environment interaction typically arises via local two-body interactions\ndescribing the exchange of quanta between system and environment, which are\nobservable in principle. That two-body-interactions are usually orthogonal on\nsystem operators, allows us to develop error corrected sensing supported by the\nobservation of the quanta that are emitted into the environment. We describe\nsuch schemes and outline a realistic proof-of-principle experiment in an ion\ntrap set-up.\n", "  A formulation of a multi-input single-output closed-loop subspace method for\nsystem identification is employed for the purpose of obtaining control-relevant\nmodel of the vacuum-plasma response in the Damavand tokamak. Such a model is\nparticularly well suited for robust controller design. The accuracy of the\nestimate of the plant dynamics is estimated by different experiments. The\nmethod has been described in this paper is a worst-case identification\ntechnique, that aims to minimize the error between the identified model and the\ntrue plant. The fitness of the identified model around defined operating point\nis more than 90% and compared with physical-based model it has better root mean\nsquare measure of the goodness of fit.\n", "  Coherence arises from the superposition principle and plays a key role in\nquantum mechanics. Recently, Baumgratz et al. [T. Baumgratz, M. Cramer, and M.\nB. Plenio, Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 140401 (2014)] established a rigorous\nframework for quantifying the coherence of finite dimensional quantum states.\nIn this work we provide a framework for quantifying the coherence of Gaussian\nstates and explicitly give a coherence measure based on the relative entropy.\n", "  I review the chiral dynamics of nuclear physics. In the first part, I discuss\nthe new developments in the construction of the forces between two, three and\nfour nucleons which have been partly carried out to fifth order in the chiral\nexpansion. It is also shown that based on these forces in conjunction with the\nestimation of the corresponding theoretical uncertainties, the need for\nthree-nucleon forces in few nucleon systems can be unambiguously established. I\nalso introduce the lattice formulation of these forces, which allow for truly\nab initio calculations of nuclear structure and reactions. I present some\npertinent results of the nuclear lattice approach. Finally, I discuss how\nfew-nucleon systems and nuclei can be used to explore symmetries and physics\nwithin and beyond the Standard Model.\n", "  Holographic gravity duals of deformations of CFTs formulated on de Sitter\nspacetime contain FRW geometries behind a horizon, with cosmological big crunch\nsingularities. Using a specific analytically tractable solution within a\nparticular single scalar truncation of N=8 supergravity on AdS_4, we first\nprobe such crunching cosmologies with spacelike radial geodesics that compute\nspatially antipodal correlators of large dimension boundary operators. At late\ntimes, the geodesics lie on the FRW slice of maximal expansion behind the\nhorizon. The late time two-point functions factorise, and when transformed to\nthe Einstein static universe, they exhibit a temporal non-analyticity\ndetermined by the maximal value of the scale factor a_{max} . Radial geodesics\nconnecting antipodal points necessarily have de Sitter energy E \\leq a_{max},\nwhile geodesics with E > a_{max} terminate at the crunch, the two categories of\ngeodesics being separated by the maximal expansion slice. The spacelike crunch\nsingularity is curved \"outward\" in the Penrose diagram for the deformed AdS\nbackgrounds, and thus geodesic limits of the antipodal correlators do not\ndirectly probe the crunch. Beyond the geodesic limit, we point out that the\nscalar wave equation, analytically continued into the FRW patch, has a\npotential which is singular at the crunch along with complex WKB turning points\nin the vicinity of the FRW crunch. We then argue that the frequency space\nGreen's function has a branch point determined by a_{max} which corresponds to\nthe lowest quasinormal frequency.\n", "  We give a scenario-based treatment plan optimization formulation that is\nequivalent to planning with geometric margins if the scenario doses are\ncalculated using the static dose cloud approximation. If the scenario doses are\ninstead calculated more accurately, then our formulation provides a novel\nrobust planning method that overcomes many of the difficulties associated with\nprevious scenario-based robust planning methods. In particular, our method\nprotects only against uncertainties that can occur in practice, it gives a\nsharp dose fall-off outside high dose regions, and it avoids underdosage of the\ntarget in ``easy'' scenarios. The method shares the benefits of the previous\nscenario-based robust planning methods over geometric margins for applications\nwhere the static dose cloud approximation is inaccurate, such as irradiation\nwith few fields and irradiation with ion beams. These properties are\ndemonstrated on a suite of phantom cases planned for treatment with scanned\nproton beams subject to systematic setup uncertainty.\n", "  Theoretical spectroscopy is a powerful tool to describe and predict optical\nproperties of materials. While nowadays routinely performed, first-principles\ncalculations only provide bulk dielectric tensors in Cartesian coordinates.\nThese outputs are hardly comparable with experimental data, which are typically\ngiven by macroscopic quantities, crucially depending on the laboratory setup.\nEven more serious discrepancies can arise for anisotropic materials, e.g.,\norganic crystals, where off-diagonal elements of the dielectric tensor can\nsignificantly contribute to the spectral features. Here, we present\nLayerOptics, a versatile and user-friendly implementation, based on the\nsolution of the Maxwell's equations for anisotropic materials, to compute\noptical coefficients in anisotropic layered materials. We apply this tool for\npost-processing full dielectric tensors of molecular materials, including\nexcitonic effects, as computed from many-body perturbation theory using the\nexciting code. For prototypical examples, ranging from optical to X-ray\nfrequencies, we show the importance of combining accurate ab initio methods to\nobtain dielectric tensors, with the solution of the Maxwell's equations to\ncompute optical coefficients accounting for optical anisotropy of layered\nsystems. Good agreement with experimental data supports the potential of our\napproach, in view of achieving microscopic understanding of spectroscopic\nproperties in complex materials.\n", "  Rare-earth ions doped into desired locations of optical crystals might enable\na range of novel integrated photonic devices for quantum applications. With\nthis aim, we have investigated the production yield of cerium and praseodymium\nby means of ion implantation. As a measure, the collected fluorescence\nintensity from both, implanted samples and single centers was used. With a\ntailored annealing procedure for cerium, a yield up to 53% was estimated.\nPraseodymium yield amounts up to 91%.\n", "  We report on a systematic study of the thermodynamic, electronic and charge\ntransport properties of high-quality single crystals of BaNiS$_2$, the metallic\nend-member of the quasi-twodimensional BaCo$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$S$_2$ system\ncharacterized by a metal-insulator transition at $x_{cr}=0.22$. Our analysis of\nmagnetoresistivity and specific heat data consistently suggests a picture of\ncompensated semimetal with two hole- and one electron-bands, where\nelectron-phonon scattering dominates charge transport and the minority holes\nexhibit, below $\\sim$100 K, a very large mobility, $\\mu_h\\sim$ 15000\ncm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, which is explained by a Dirac-like band. Evidence of\nunconventional metallic properties is given by an intriguing crossover of the\nresistivity from a Bloch-Gr\\\"uneisen regime to a linear$-T$ regime occurring at\n2 K and by a strong linear term in the paramagnetic susceptibility above 100 K.\nWe discuss the possibility that these anomalies reflect a departure from\nconventional Fermi-liquid properties in presence of short-range AF fluctuations\nand of a large Hund coupling.\n", "  We study supersymmetric scenarios in which the gluino is the next-to-lightest\nsupersymmetric particle (NLSP), with a mass sufficiently close to that of the\nlightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) that gluino coannihilation becomes\nimportant. One of these scenarios is the MSSM with soft supersymmetry-breaking\nsquark and slepton masses that are universal at an input GUT renormalization\nscale, but with non-universal gaugino masses. The other scenario is an\nextension of the MSSM to include vector-like supermultiplets. In both\nscenarios, we identify the regions of parameter space where gluino\ncoannihilation is important, and discuss their relations to other regions of\nparameter space where other mechanisms bring the dark matter density into the\nrange allowed by cosmology. In the case of the non-universal MSSM scenario, we\nfind that the allowed range of parameter space is constrained by the\nrequirement of electroweak symmetry breaking, the avoidance of a charged LSP\nand the measured mass of the Higgs boson, in particular, as well as the\nappearance of other dark matter (co)annihilation processes. Nevertheless, LSP\nmasses $m_\\chi \\lesssim 8$~TeV with the correct dark matter density are quite\npossible. In the case of pure gravity mediation with additional vector-like\nsupermultiplets, changes to the anomaly-mediated gluino mass and the threshold\neffects associated with these states can make the gluino almost degenerate with\nthe LSP, and we find a similar upper bound.\n", "  We show that the presence of negative eigenvalues in the spectrum of the\nangular component of an electromagnetic Schr\\\"odinger hamiltonian $H$\ngenerically produces a lack of the classical time-decay for the associated\nSchr\\\"odinger flow $e^{-itH}$. This is in contrast with the fact that\ndispersive estimates (Strichartz) still hold, in general, also in this case. We\nalso observe an improvement of the decay for higher positive modes, showing\nthat the time decay of the solution is due to the first nonzero term in the\nexpansion of the initial datum as a series of eigenfunctions of a quantum\nharmonic oscillator with a singular potential. A completely analogous\nphenomenon is shown for the heat semigroup, as expected.\n", "  We present new near-infrared Cepheid Period-Wesenheit relations in the LMC\nusing time-series observations from the Large Magellanic Cloud Near-Infrared\nSynoptic Survey. We also derive optical$+$near-infrared P-W relations using $V$\nand $I$~magnitudes from OGLE-III. We employ our new $JHK_s$ data to determine\nan independent distance to the LMC of $\\mu_{\\rm LMC} = 18.47\\pm0.07\n{\\textit{(statistical)}}$~mag, using an absolute calibration of the Galactic\nrelations based on several distance determination methods and accounting for\nthe intrinsic scatter of each technique. We also derive new near-infrared\nPeriod-Luminosity and Wesenheit relations for Cepheids in M31 using\nobservations from the PHAT survey. We use the absolute calibrations of the\nGalactic and LMC $W_{J,H}$ relations to determine the distance modulus of M31,\n$\\mu_{\\rm M31} = 24.46\\pm0.20$~mag. We apply a simultaneous fit to Cepheids in\nseveral Local Group galaxies covering a range of metallicities\n($7.7<12+\\log[O/H]<8.6$~dex) to determine a global slope of\n-$3.244\\pm0.016$~mag/dex for the $W_{J,K_s}$ relation and obtain robust\ndistance estimates. Our distances are in good agreement with recent TRGB based\ndistance estimates and we do not find any evidence for a metallicity dependence\nin the near-infrared P-W relations.\n", "  The reaction-diffusion master equation (RDME) is a standard modelling\napproach for understanding stochastic and spatial chemical kinetics. An\ninherent assumption is that molecules are point-like. Here we introduce the\ncrowded reaction-diffusion master equation (cRDME) which takes into account\nvolume exclusion effects on stochastic kinetics due to a finite molecular\nradius. We obtain an exact closed form solution of the RDME and of the cRDME\nfor a general chemical system in equilibrium conditions. The difference between\nthe two solutions increases with the ratio of molecular diameter to the\ncompartment length scale. We show that an increase in molecular crowding can\n(i) lead to deviations from the classical inverse square root law for the\nnoise-strength; (ii) flip the skewness of the probability distribution from\nright to left-skewed; (iii) shift the equilibrium of bimolecular reactions so\nthat more product molecules are formed; (iv) strongly modulate the Fano factors\nand coefficients of variation. These crowding-induced effects are found to be\nparticularly pronounced for chemical species not involved in chemical\nconservation laws.Finally we show that statistics obtained using the vRDME are\nin good agreement with those obtained from Brownian dynamics with excluded\nvolume interactions.\n", "  The connection between certain entangled states and graphs has been heavily\nstudied in the context of measurement-based quantum computation as a tool for\nunderstanding entanglement. Here we show that this correspondence can be\nharnessed in the reverse direction to yield a graph data structure which allows\nfor more efficient manipulation and comparison of graphs than any possible\nclassical structure. We introduce efficient algorithms for many transformation\nand comparison operations on graphs represented as graph states, and prove that\nno classical data structure can have similar performance for the full set of\noperations studied.\n", "  Knowledge of the electronic band structure of multiferroic oxides, crucial\nfor the understanding and tuning of photo-induced effects, remains very limited\neven in the model and thoroughly studied BiFeO3. Here, we investigate the\nelectronic band structure of BiFeO3 using Raman scattering with twelve\ndifferent excitation wavelengths ranging from the blue to the near infrared. We\nshow that resonant Raman signatures can be assigned to direct and indirect\nelectronic transitions, as well as in-gap electronic levels, most likely\nassociated to oxygen vacancies. Their temperature evolution establishes that\nthe remarkable and intriguing variation of the optical band-gap can be related\nto the shrinking of an indirect electronic band-gap, while the energies for\ndirect electronic transitions remains nearly temperature independent.\n", "  Tensor networks implementing quantum error correcting codes have recently\nbeen used to construct toy models of holographic duality explicitly realizing\nsome of the more puzzling features of the AdS/CFT correspondence. These models\nreproduce the Ryu-Takayanagi entropy formula for boundary intervals, and allow\nbulk operators to be mapped to the boundary in a redundant fashion. These\nexactly solvable, explicit models have provided valuable insight but\nnonetheless suffer from many deficiencies, some of which we attempt to address\nin this article. We propose a new class of tensor network models that subsume\nthe earlier advances and, in addition, incorporate additional features of\nholographic duality, including: (1) a holographic interpretation of all\nboundary states, not just those in a \"code\" subspace, (2) a set of bulk states\nplaying the role of \"classical geometries\" which reproduce the Ryu-Takayanagi\nformula for boundary intervals, (3) a bulk gauge symmetry analogous to\ndiffeomorphism invariance in gravitational theories, (4) emergent bulk locality\nfor sufficiently sparse excitations, and (5) the ability to describe geometry\nat sub-AdS resolutions or even flat space.\n", "  Spin glass (SG) is a typical magnetic system with frozen random spin\norientation at low temperatures. The system exhibits rich physical properties,\nsuch as infinite number of ground states, memory effect and aging phenomena.\nThere are two main ingredients considered to be pivotal for the existence of SG\nbehavior, namely, frustration and randomness. For the canonical SG system,\nfrustration is led by the presence of competing interaction between\nferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AF) couplings. Previously, Bartolozzi\n{\\it et al.} [ Phys. Rev. B{\\bf 73}, 224419 (2006)], reported the SG properties\nof the AF Ising spins on scale free network (SFN). It is a new type of SG,\ndifferent from the canonical one which requires the presence of both FM and AF\ncouplings. In this new system, frustration is purely caused by the topological\nfactor and its randomness is related to the irregular connectvity. Recently,\nSurungan {\\it et. al.} [Journal of Physics: Conference Series 640, 012001\n(2015)] reported SG bahavior of AF Heisenberg model on SFN. We further\ninvestigate this type of system by studying an AF Heisenberg model on rewired\nsquare lattices. We used Replica Exchange algorithm of Monte Carlo Method and\ncalculated the SG order parameter to search for the existence of SG phase.\n", "  We study the collision of a highly energetic light closed string off a stack\nof Dp-branes at (sub)string-scale impact parameters and in a regime justifying\na perturbative treatment. Unlike at larger impact parameters - where elastic\nscattering and/or tidal excitations dominate - here absorption of the closed\nstring by the brane system, with the associated excitation of open strings\nliving on it, becomes important. As a first step, we study this phenomenon at\nthe disk level, in which the energetic closed string turns into a single heavy\nopen string at rest whose particularly simple properties are described.\n", "  Mott insulating ultracold gases posses a unique whole-atom exchange\ninteraction which enables large quantum fluctuations between the Zeeman\nsublevels of each atom. By strengthening this interaction---either through the\nuse of large-spin atoms, or by tuning the particle-particle interactions via\noptical Feshbach resonance---one may enhance fluctuations and facilitate the\nappearance of the long sought-after quantum spin liquid phase---all in the\nhighly tunable environment of cold atoms. To illustrate the relationship\nbetween the spin magnitude, interaction strength, and resulting magnetic\nphases, we present and solve a mean field theory for bosons optically confined\nto the one particle-per-site Mott state, using both analytic and numerical\nmethods. We find on a square lattice with bosons of hyperfine spin $f>2$, that\nmaking the repulsive s-wave scattering length through the singlet channel\nsmall---relative to the higher-order scattering channels---accesses a\nshort-range resonating valence bond (s-RVB) spin liquid phase.\n", "  We show how the Higgs boson mass is protected from the potentially large\ncorrections due to the introduction of minimal dark matter if the new physics\nsector is made supersymmetric. The fermionic dark matter candidate (a 5-plet of\n$SU(2)_L$) is accompanied by a scalar state. The weak gauge sector is made\nsupersymmetric and the Higgs boson is embedded in a supersymmetric multiplet.\nThe remaining standard model states are non-supersymmetric. Non vanishing\ncorrections to the Higgs boson mass only appear at three-loop level and the\nmodel is natural for dark matter masses up to 15 TeV--a value larger than the\none required by the cosmological relic density. The construction presented\nstands as an example of a general approach to naturalness that solves the\nlittle hierarchy problem which arises when new physics is added beyond the\nstandard model at an energy scale around 10 TeV.\n", "  We propose a simple model to study the Gouy phase effect in the triple-slit\nexperiment in which we consider a non-classical path. The Gouy phase differs\nfor classical or non-classical paths as it depends on the propagation time. In\nthis case the Gouy phase difference changes the Sorkin parameter $\\kappa$ used\nto estimate non-classical path contribution in a nontrivial way shedding some\nlight in the implementation of experiments to detect non-classical path\ncontributions.\n", "  We present multi-sightline absorption spectroscopy of cool gas around three\nlensing galaxies at z=0.4-0.7. These lenses have half-light radii r_e=2.6-8 kpc\nand stellar masses of log M*/Ms=10.9-11.4, and therefore resemble nearby\npassive elliptical galaxies. The lensed QSO sightlines presented here occur at\nprojected distances of d=3-15 kpc (or d~1-2 r_e) from the lensing galaxies,\nproviding for the first time an opportunity to probe both interstellar gas at\nr~r_e and circumgalactic gas at larger radii r>>re of these distant quiescent\ngalaxies. We observe distinct gas absorption properties among different lenses\nand among sightlines of individual lenses. Specifically, while the quadruple\nlens for HE0435-1223 shows no absorption features to very sensitive limits\nalong all four sightlines, strong Mg II, Fe II, Mg I, and Ca II absorption\ntransitions are detected along both sightlines near the double lens for\nHE0047-1756, and in one of the two sightlines near the double lens for\nHE1104-1805. The absorbers are resolved into 8-15 individual components with a\nline-of-sight velocity spread of dv~300-600 km/s. The large ionic column\ndensities, log N>14, observed in two components suggest that these may be Lyman\nlimit or damped Lya absorbers with a significant neutral hydrogen fraction. The\nmajority of the absorbing components exhibit a uniform super solar Fe/Mg ratio\nwith a scatter of <0.1 dex across the full dv range. Given a predominantly old\nstellar population in these lensing galaxies, we argue that the observed large\nvelocity width and Fe-rich abundance pattern can be explained by SNe Ia\nenriched gas at radius r~r_e. We show that additional spatial constraints in\nline-of-sight velocity and relative abundance ratios afforded by a\nmulti-sightline approach provide a powerful tool to resolve the origin of\nchemically-enriched cool gas in massive halos.\n", "  We describe frequency stabilization of a laser at 707.202 nm wavelength using\nFM spectroscopy in a hollow cathode lamp. The laser is stabilized to the\n$^{88}$Sr metastable $^3\\mathrm{P}_2$ to $^3\\mathrm{S}_1$ optical transition.\nThe stabilized laser is utilized for laser-cooling and trapping of strontium\natoms. We also briefly describe the performance of a polarization spectroscopy\nlock of our blue MOT laser at 461 nm derived simultaneously from the same\nhollow cathode lamp.\n", "  We use the exclusive baryonic $B$ decays to determine the\nCabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element $V_{ub}$. From the relation\n$|V_{ub}|^2/|V_{cb}|^2=({\\cal B}_\\pi/{\\cal B}_D){\\cal R}_{ff}$ based on $B^-\\to\np\\bar p \\pi^-$ and $\\bar B^0\\to p\\bar p D^0$ decays, where $|V_{cb}|$ and\n${\\cal B}_\\pi/{\\cal B}_D\\equiv{\\cal B}(B^-\\to p\\bar p \\pi^-)/{\\cal B}(\\bar\nB^0\\to p\\bar p D^0)$ are the data input parameters, while ${\\cal R}_{ff}$ is\nthe one fixed by the $B\\to p\\bar p$ transition matrix elements, we find\n$|V_{ub}|=(3.48^{+0.87}_{-0.63}\\pm 0.40\\pm 0.07)\\times 10^{-3}$ with the errors\ncorresponding to the uncertainties from ${\\cal R}_{ff}$, ${\\cal B}_\\pi/{\\cal\nB}_D$ and $|V_{cb}|$, respectively. Being independent of the previous results,\nour determination of $|V_{ub}|$ has the central value close to those from the\nexclusive $\\bar B\\to \\pi\\ell\\bar \\nu_\\ell$ and $\\Lambda_b\\to p\\mu^-\\bar\n\\nu_\\mu$ decays, but overlaps the one from the inclusive $\\bar B\\to X_u\n\\ell\\bar \\nu_\\ell$ with the current uncertainties. The extraction of $|V_{ub}|$\nin the baryonic $B$ decays is clearly very useful for the complete\ndetermination of the CKM matrix elements as well as the exploration of new\nphysics.\n", "  Model-space effective interactions $V_{eff}$ derived from free-space\nnucleon-nucleon interactions $V_{NN}$ are reviewed. We employ a double\ndecimation approach: first we extract a low-momentum interaction $V_{low-k}$\nfrom $V_{NN}$ using a $T$-matrix equivalence decimation method. Then $V_{eff}$\nis obtained from $V_{low-k}$ by way of a folded-diagram effective interaction\nmethod. For decimation momentum $\\Lambda \\simeq 2 fm^{-1}$, the $V_{low-k}$\ninteractions derived from different realistic $V_{NN}$ models are nearly model\nindependent, and so are the resulting shell-model effective interactions. For\nnucleons in a low-density nuclear medium like valence nucleons near the nuclear\nsurface, such effective interactions derived from free-space $V_{NN}$ are\nsatisfactory in reproducing experimental nuclear properties. But it is not so\nfor nucleons in a nuclear medium with density near or beyond nuclear matter\nsaturation density. In this case it may be necessary to include the effects\nfrom Brown-Rho (BR) scaling of hadrons and/or three-nucleon forces $V_{3N}$,\neffectively changing the free-space $V_{NN}$ into a density-dependent one. The\ndensity-dependent effects from BR scaling and $V_{3N}$ are compared with those\nfrom empirical Skyrme effective interactions.\n", "  Owing to the rapid progress in laser technology, very high-contrast\nfemtosecond laser pulses of relativistic intensities become available. These\npulses allow for interaction with micro-structured solid-density plasma without\ndestroying the structure by parasitic pre-pulses. This opens a new realm of\npossibilities for laser interaction with micro- and nano-scales photonic\nmaterials at the relativistic intensities. Here we demonstrate, for the first\ntime, that when coupling with a readily available 1.8 Joule laser, a\nmicro-plasma-waveguide (MPW) may serve as a novel compact x-ray source.\nElectrons are extracted from the walls and form a dense self-organized helical\nbunch inside the channel. These electrons are efficiently accelerated and\nwiggled by the waveguide modes in the MPW, which results in a bright,\nwell-collimated emission of hard x-rays in the range of 1~100 keV.\n", "  We apply a Boltzmann approach to the kinetic regime of a relativistic\nBose-Einstein condensate of scalar bosons by decomposing the one-particle\ndistribution function in a condensate part and a non-zero momentum part of\nexcited modes, leading to a coupled set of evolution equations which are then\nsolved efficiently with an adaptive higher order Runge-Kutta scheme. We compare\nour results to the partonic cascade Monte-Carlo simulation BAMPS for a critical\nbut far from equilibrium case of massless bosons. Motivated by the color glass\ncondensate initial conditions in QCD with a strongly overpopulated initial\nglasma state, we also discuss the time evolution starting from an overpopulated\ninitial distribution function of massive scalar bosons. In this system a\nself-similar evolution of the particle cascade with a non-relativistic\nturbulent scaling in the infrared sector is observed as well as a relativistic\nexponent for the direct energy cascade, confirming a weak wave turbulence in\nthe ultraviolet region.\n", "  We calculate the branching ratios of chi_{b0} --> tau+ tau- via an s-channel\nHiggs boson and estimate the sensitivity to this process from Upsilon --> gamma\nchi_{b0} --> gamma tau+ tau-. We show that future running at the Upsilon(3S) at\na very high luminosity super B factory can put significant constraints on the\nType-II two-Higgs-doublet model when the discovered 125 GeV Higgs boson is the\nheavier of the two CP-even scalars.\n", "  In this work, we present mass limits on gluinos and stops in a natural\nNext-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) with a singlino as the\nlightest supersymmetric particle. Motivated by naturalness, we consider spectra\nwith light higgsinos, sub-TeV third generation sparticles and gluinos well\nbelow the multi-TeV regime while the electroweak gauginos, the sleptons and the\nfirst and second generation squarks are decoupled. We check that our natural\nsupersymmetry spectra satisfy all electroweak precision observables and flavour\nmeasurements as well as theoretical constraints. By reinterpreting the results\nfrom the 8 TeV ATLAS supersymmetry searches we present the 95% CL exclusion\nlimits on the model. The results show that the presence of a singlino LSP can\nlengthen decay chains and soften the final state particle energies. Whilst this\ndoes reduce the strength of the bounds in some areas of parameter space, the\nLHC still displays good sensitivity to the model.\n", "  A Markov process fluctuating away from its typical behavior can be\nrepresented in the long-time limit by another Markov process, called the\neffective or driven process, having the same stationary states as the original\nprocess conditioned on the fluctuation observed. We construct here this driven\nprocess for diffusions spending an atypical fraction of their evolution in some\nregion of state space, corresponding mathematically to stochastic differential\nequations conditioned on occupation measures. As an illustration, we consider\nthe Langevin equation conditioned on staying for a fraction of time in\ndifferent intervals of the real line, including the positive half-line which\nleads to a generalization of the Brownian meander problem. Other applications\nrelated to quasi-stationary distributions, metastable states, noisy chemical\nreactions, queues, and random walks are discussed.\n", "  We investigate the pre-inflationary dynamics of inflation with the\nStarobinsky potential, favored by recent data from the Planck mission, using\ntechniques developed to study cosmological perturbations on quantum spacetimes\nin the framework of loop quantum cosmology. We find that for a large part of\nthe initial data, inflation compatible with observations occurs. There exists a\nsubset of this initial data that leads to quantum gravity signatures that are\npotentially observable. Interestingly, despite the different inflationary\ndynamics, these quantum gravity corrections to the powerspectra are similar to\nthose obtained for inflation with a quadratic potential, including suppression\nof power at large scales. Furthermore, for super horizon modes the tensor modes\nshow deviations from the standard inflationary paradigm that are unique to the\nStarobinsky potential and could be important for non-Gaussian modulation and\ntensor fossils.\n", "  Employing a recently developed many-body technique that allows for the\nincorporation of thermal effects, the rich phase diagram of a two dimensional\ntwo orbital (degenerate $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$) Hubbard model is presented\nvarying temperature and the repulsion $U$. Our main result is the finding at\nintermediate $U$ of a novel antiferromagnetic orbital selective state where an\neffective dimensional reduction renders one direction insulating and the other\nmetallic. Possible realizations of this state are discussed. In addition we\nalso study nematicity above the N\\'eel temperature. After a careful finite-size\nscaling analysis the nematicity temperature window appears to survive in the\nbulk limit although it is very narrow.\n", "  We analyze basic relativistic wave equations for the classical fields, such\nas Dirac's equation, Weyl's two-component equation for massless neutrinos, and\nthe Proca, Maxwell, and Fierz-Pauli equations, from the viewpoint of the\nPauli-Lubanski vector and the Casimir operators of the Poincare group. In\ngeneral, in this group-theoretical approach, the above wave equations arise in\ncertain overdetermined forms, which can be reduced to the conventional ones by\na Gaussian elimination. A connection between the spin of a particle/field and\nconsistency of the corresponding overdetermined system is emphasized in the\nmassless case.\n", "  We investigate coupled spin and heat transport in easy-plane magnetic\ninsulators. These materials display a continuous phase transition between\nnormal and condensate states that is controlled by an external magnetic field.\nUsing hydrodynamic equations supplemented by Gross-Pitaevski phenomenology and\nmagnetoelectric circuit theory, we derive a two-fluid model to describe the\ndynamics of thermal and condensed magnons, and the appropriate boundary\nconditions in a hybrid normal-metal|magnetic-insulator|normal-metal\nheterostructure. We discuss how the emergent spin superfluidity can be\nexperimentally probed via a spin Seebeck effect measurement.\n", "  In the minimal supersymmetric standard models, neutralino dark matter with\nmass of $m_{\\chi}\\sim m_Z/2\\sim 45$ GeV and $m_{\\chi}\\sim m_h/2\\sim 62$ GeV can\nhave the thermal relic abundance $\\Omega_{\\chi_1}h^2\\simeq 0.120$ via the $Z$-\nand Higgs-resonant annihilations, respectively, while avoiding all the current\nconstraints. Phenomenology of such scenarios is determined only by three\nparameters, Bino mass $M_1$, Higgsino mass $\\mu$, and $\\tan\\beta$, in the limit\nthat all other supersymmetric particles and heavy Higgs bosons are decoupled.\nIn this paper, we comprehensively study the constraints and future prospects of\nthe search for such Higgs- and $Z$-resonant neutralino dark matter. It is shown\nthat almost all the parameter space of the scenario will be probed\ncomplementarily by the LHC search for the chargino and neutralinos, the direct\ndetection experiments, and the Higgs invisible decay search at the ILC.\n", "  In this paper we present the measurement of the response of 50 $\\mu$m thin\ndiamond detectors to 14 MeV neutrons. Such neutrons are produced in fusion\nreactors and are of particular interest for ITER neutron diagnostics. Among\nsemiconductor detectors diamond has properties most appropriate for harsh\nradiation and temperature conditions of a fusion reactor. However, 300-500\n$\\mu$m thick diamond detectors suffer significant radiation damage already at\nneutron fluences of the order of $10^{14}$ n/cm$^2$. It is expected that a 50\n$\\mu$m thick diamond will withstand a fluence of $>10^{16}$ n/cm$^2$. We tested\ntwo 50 $\\mu$m thick single crystal CVD diamonds, stacked to form a \"sandwich\"\ndetector for coincidence measurements. The detector measured the conversion of\n14 MeV neutrons, impinging on one diamond, into $\\alpha$ particles which were\ndetected in the second diamond in coincidence with nuclear recoil. For\n$^{12}C(n,\\alpha)^{9}Be$ reaction the total energy deposited in the detector\ngives access to the initial neutron energy value. The measured 14 MeV neutron\ndetection sensitivity through this reaction by a detector of effective area\n3$\\times$3 mm$^2$ was $5\\times 10^{-7}$ counts cm$^2$/n. This value is in good\nagreement with Geant4 simulations. The intrinsic energy resolution of the\ndetector was found to be 240 keV FWHM which adds only 10 % to ITER's 14 MeV\nneutron energy spread.\n", "  We study ${\\cal N}=2$ compactifications of heterotic string theory on the CHL\norbifold $(K3\\times T^2)/\\mathbb{Z}_N$ with $N= 2, 3, 5, 7$. $\\mathbb{Z}_N$\nacts as an involution on $K3$ together with a shift of $1/N$ along one of the\ncircles of $T^2$. These compactifications generalize the example of the\nheterotic string on $K3\\times T^2$ studied in the context of dualities in\n${\\cal N}=2$ string theories. We evaluate the new supersymmetric index for\nthese theories and show that their expansion can written in terms of the\nMcKay-Thompson series associated with the $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ involution embedded in\nthe Mathieu group $M_{24}$. We then evaluate the difference in one-loop\nthreshold corrections to the non-Abelian gauge couplings with Wilson lines and\nshow that their moduli dependence is captured by Siegel modular forms related\nto dyon partition functions of ${\\cal N}=4$ string theories.\n", "  We present 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the adiabatic interaction of a\nshock with a dense, spherical cloud. We compare how the nature of the\ninteraction changes with the Mach number of the shock, $M$, and the density\ncontrast of the cloud, $\\chi$. We examine the differences with 2D axisymmetric\ncalculations, perform detailed resolution tests, and compare \"inviscid\" results\nto those obtained with the inclusion of a $k$-$\\epsilon$ subgrid turbulence\nmodel. Resolutions of 32-64 cells per cloud radius are the minimum necessary to\ncapture the dominant dynamical processes in 3D simulations, while the 3D\ninviscid and $k$-$\\epsilon$ simulations typically show very good agreement.\nClouds accelerate and mix up to 5 times faster when they are poorly resolved.\nThe interaction proceeds very similarly in 2D and 3D - although non-azimuthal\nmodes lead to different behaviour, there is very little effect on key global\nquantities such as the lifetime of the cloud and its acceleration. In\nparticular, we do not find significant differences in the hollowing or\n\"voiding\" of the cloud between 2D and 3D simulations with $M=10$ and $\\chi=10$,\nwhich contradicts previous work in the literature.\n", "  We analyse the sensitivity of a spin chain modelled by an undirected weighted\nconnected graph exhibiting perfect state transfer to small perturbations in\nreadout time and edge weight in order to obtain physically relevant bounds on\nthe probability of state transfer. At the heart of our analysis is the concept\nof the numerical range of a matrix; our analysis of edge weight errors\nadditionally makes use of the spectral and Frobenius norms.\n", "  We study the connection of star formation to atomic (HI) and molecular\nhydrogen (H$_2$) in isolated, low metallicity dwarf galaxies with\nhigh-resolution ($m_{\\rm gas}$ = 4 M$_\\odot$, $N_{\\rm ngb}$ = 100) SPH\nsimulations. The model includes self-gravity, non-equilibrium cooling,\nshielding from an interstellar radiation field, the chemistry of H$_2$\nformation, H$_2$-independent star formation, supernova feedback and metal\nenrichment. We find that the H$_2$ mass fraction is sensitive to the adopted\ndust-to-gas ratio and the strength of the interstellar radiation field, while\nthe star formation rate is not. Star formation is regulated by stellar\nfeedback, keeping the gas out of thermal equilibrium for densities $n <$ 1\ncm$^{-3}$. Because of the long chemical timescales, the H$_2$ mass remains out\nof chemical equilibrium throughout the simulation. Star formation is\nwell-correlated with cold ( T $\\leqslant$ 100 K ) gas, but this dense and cold\ngas - the reservoir for star formation - is dominated by HI, not H$_2$. In\naddition, a significant fraction of H$_2$ resides in a diffuse, warm phase,\nwhich is not star-forming. The ISM is dominated by warm gas (100 K $<$ T\n$\\leqslant 3\\times 10^4$ K) both in mass and in volume. The scale height of the\ngaseous disc increases with radius while the cold gas is always confined to a\nthin layer in the mid-plane. The cold gas fraction is regulated by feedback at\nsmall radii and by the assumed radiation field at large radii. The decreasing\ncold gas fractions result in a rapid increase in depletion time (up to 100\nGyrs) for total gas surface densities $\\Sigma_{\\rm HI+H_2} \\lesssim$ 10\nM$_\\odot$pc$^{-2}$, in agreement with observations of dwarf galaxies in the\nKennicutt-Schmidt plane.\n", "  Using a radio-quiet subsample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopic\nquasar catalogue, spanning redshifts 0.5-3.5, we derive the mean millimetre and\nfar-infrared quasar spectral energy distributions (SEDs) via a stacking\nanalysis of Atacama Cosmology Telescope and Herschel-Spectral and Photometric\nImaging REceiver data. We constrain the form of the far-infrared emission and\nfind 3$\\sigma$-4$\\sigma$ evidence for the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ)\neffect, characteristic of a hot ionized gas component with thermal energy $(6.2\n\\pm 1.7)\\times 10^{60}$ erg. This amount of thermal energy is greater than\nexpected assuming only hot gas in virial equilibrium with the dark matter\nhaloes of $(1-5)\\times 10^{12}h^{-1}$M$_\\odot$ that these systems are expected\nto occupy, though the highest quasar mass estimates found in the literature\ncould explain a large fraction of this energy. Our measurements are consistent\nwith quasars depositing up to $(14.5 \\pm 3.3)~\\tau_8^{-1}$ per cent of their\nradiative energy into their circumgalactic environment if their typical period\nof quasar activity is $\\tau_8\\times~10^8$ yr. For high quasar host masses,\n$\\sim10^{13}h^{-1}$M$_\\odot$, this percentage will be reduced. Furthermore, the\nuncertainty on this percentage is only statistical and additional systematic\nuncertainties enter at the 40 per cent level. The SEDs are dust dominated in\nall bands and we consider various models for dust emission. While sufficiently\ncomplex dust models can obviate the SZ effect, the SZ interpretation remains\nfavoured at the 3$\\sigma$-4$\\sigma$ level for most models.\n", "  We report the discovery of HATS-17b, the first transiting warm Jupiter of the\nHATSouth network. HATS-17b transits its bright (V=12.4) G-type\n(M$_{\\star}$=1.131 $\\pm$ 0.030 M$_{\\odot}$,\nR$_{\\star}$=1.091$^{+0.070}_{-0.046}$ R$_{\\star}$) metal-rich ([Fe/H]=+0.3 dex)\nhost star in a circular orbit with a period of P=16.2546 days. HATS-17b has a\nvery compact radius of 0.777 $\\pm$ 0.056 R$_J$ given its Jupiter-like mass of\n1.338 $\\pm$ 0.065 M$_J$. Up to 50% of the mass of HATS-17b may be composed of\nheavy elements in order to explain its high density with current models of\nplanetary structure. HATS-17b is the longest period transiting planet\ndiscovered to date by a ground-based photometric survey, and is one of the\nbrightest transiting warm Jupiter systems known. The brightness of HATS-17b\nwill allow detailed follow-up observations to characterize the orbital geometry\nof the system and the atmosphere of the planet.\n", "  An electron irradiated by a linearly polarized relativistic intensity laser\npulse in a cylindrical plasma channel can gain significant energy from the\npulse. The laser electric and magnetic fields drive electron oscillations in a\nplane making it natural to expect the electron trajectory to be flat. We show\nthat strong modulations of the relativistic $\\gamma$-factor associated with the\nenergy enhancement cause the free oscillations perpendicular to the plane of\nthe driven motion to become unstable. As a consequence, out of plane\ndisplacements grow to become comparable to the amplitude of the driven\noscillations and the electron trajectory becomes essentially three-dimensional,\neven if at an early stage of the acceleration it was flat. The development of\nthe instability profoundly affects the x-ray emission, causing considerable\ndivergence of the radiation perpendicular to the plane of the driven\noscillations, while also reducing the overall emitted energy.\n", "  We report on a Kondo correlated quantum dot connected to two-dimensional\nleads where we demonstrate the renormalization of the g-factor in the pure\nZeeman case i.e, for magnetic fields parallel to the plane of the quantum dot.\nFor the same system we study the influence of orbital effects by investigating\nthe quantum Hall regime i.e. a perpendicular magnetic field is applied. In this\ncase an unusual behaviour of the suppression of the Kondo effect and of the\nsplit zero-bias anomaly is observed. The splitting decreases with magnetic\nfield and shows discontinuous changes which are attributed to the intricate\ninterplay between Kondo screening and the quantum Hall edge structure\noriginating from electrostatic screening. This edge structure made up of\ncompressible and incompressible stripes strongly affects the Kondo temperature\nof the quantum dot and thereby influences the renormalized g-factor.\n", "  This paper reports a detailed study of techniques for identifying boosted,\nhadronically decaying $W$ bosons using 20fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision\ndata collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy\n$\\sqrt{s} =$ 8 TeV. A range of techniques for optimising the signal jet mass\nresolution are combined with various jet substructure variables. The results of\nthese studies in Monte Carlo simulations show that a simple pairwise\ncombination of groomed jet mass and one substructure variable can provide a 50%\nefficiency for identifying $W$ bosons with transverse momenta larger than 200\nGeV while maintaining multijet background efficiencies of 2-4% for jets with\nthe same transverse momentum. These signal and background efficiencies are\nconfirmed in data for a selection of tagging techniques.\n", "  Strong electron correlations and interference effects are discussed in\nparallel-coupled single-level and orbitally doubly degenerate quantum dots. The\nfinite-U mean-field slave boson approach is used to study many-body effects.\nThe analysis is carried out in a wide range of parameter space including both\natomic-like and molecular-like Kondo regimes and taking into account various\nperturbations, like interdot tunneling, interdot interaction, mixing of the\nelectrode channels and exchange interaction. We also discuss the influence of\nsingularities of electronic structure and the impact of polarization of\nelectrodes. Special attention is paid to potential spintronic applications of\nthese systems showing how current polarization can be controlled by adjusting\ninterference conditions and correlations by gate voltage. Simple proposals of\ndouble dot spin valve and bipolar electrically tunable spin filter are\npresented.\n", "  We theoretically search for dynamical cross-correlated responses of\nthree-dimensional topological superconductors and superfluids. It has been\nsuggested that a gravitational topological term, which is analogous to the\ntheta term in topological insulators, can be derived in three-dimensional\ntime-reversal invariant topological superconductors and superfluids, and that\nthe dynamical gravitational axion field can be realized by the fluctuation of\nthe relative phase, i.e., by the Leggett mode between topological $p$-wave\npairing and conventional $s$-wave pairing. In the presence of the dynamical\ngravitational axion field, we propose the emergence of the \"chiral\ngravitomagnetic effect\", a thermal current generation by gravitomagnetic\nfields, i.e., by mechanical rotations. This effect can be regarded as a thermal\ncounterpart of the chiral magnetic effect which has been studied mainly in Weyl\nsemimetals. We also show the occurrence of the anomalous thermal Hall effect in\nthe bulk. We discuss a possible application of our study to the thermal\nresponses of Weyl superconductors.\n", "  IceCube collaboration has seen an unexpected population of high energy\nneutrinos compatible with an astrophysical origin. We consider two categories\nof events that can help to diagnose cosmic neutrinos: double pulse, that may\nallow us to clearly discriminate the cosmic component of tau neutrinos;\ncascades with deposited energy above 2 PeV, including events produced by\nelectron antineutrinos at the Glashow resonance, that can be used to\ninvestigate the neutrino production mechanisms. We show that one half of the\ndouble pulse signal is due to the neutrinos spectral region already probed by\nIceCube. By normalizing to HESE data, we find that 10 more years are required\nto obtain 90% probability to observe a double pulse. The cascades above 2 PeV\nprovide us a sensitive probe of the high energy tail of the neutrino spectrum\nand are potentially observable, but even in this case, the dependence on type\nof the source is mild. In fact we find that pp or p{\\gamma} mechanisms give a\ndifference in the number of cascades above 2 PeV of about 25 % that can be\ndiscriminated at 2{\\sigma} in about 50 years of data taking.\n", "  The hypothesis that living systems can benefit from operating at the vicinity\nof critical points has gained momentum in recent years. Criticality may confer\nan optimal balance between exceedingly ordered and too noisy states. We here\npresent a model, based on information theory and statistical mechanics,\nillustrating how and why a community of agents aimed at understanding and\ncommunicating with each other converges to a globally coherent state in which\nall individuals are close to an internal critical state, i.e. at the borderline\nbetween order and disorder. We study --both analytically and computationally--\nthe circumstances under which criticality is the best possible outcome of the\ndynamical process, confirming the convergence to critical points under very\ngeneric conditions. Finally, we analyze the effect of cooperation (agents try\nto enhance not only their fitness, but also that of other individuals) and\ncompetition (agents try to improve their own fitness and to diminish those of\ncompetitors) within our setting. The conclusion is that, while competition\nfosters criticality, cooperation hinders it and can lead to more ordered or\nmore disordered consensual solutions.\n", "  We construct models where initial and boundary conditions can be found from\nthe fundamental rules of physics, without the need to assume them, they will be\nderived from the action principle. Those constraints are established from\nphysical view point, and it is not in the form of Lagrange multipliers. We show\nsome examples from the past and some new examples which can be useful, where\nconstraint can be obtained from the action principle. Those actions represent\nphysical models. We show that it is possible to use our rule to get those\nconstraints directly.\n", "  We study scalar perturbations of four dimensional topological nonlinear\ncharged Lifshitz black holes with spherical and plane transverse sections, and\nwe find numerically the quasinormal modes for scalar fields. Then, we study the\nstability of these black holes under massive and massless scalar field\nperturbations. We focus our study on the dependence of the dynamical exponent,\nthe nonlinear exponent, the angular momentum and the mass of the scalar field\nin the modes. It is found that the modes are overdamped depending strongly on\nthe dynamical exponent and the angular momentum of the scalar field for a\nspherical transverse section. In constrast, for plane transverse sections the\nmodes are always overdamped.\n", "  We present a potentially efficient dynamical formation scenario for Low Mass\nX-ray Binaries (LMXBs) in the field, focusing on black-hole (BH) LMXBs. In this\nformation channel LMXBs are formed from wide binaries $(>1000$ AU) with a BH\ncomponent and a stellar companion. The wide binary is perturbed by fly-by's of\nfield stars and its orbit random-walks and changes over time. This diffusion\nprocess can drive the binary into a sufficiently eccentric orbit such that the\nbinary components tidally interact at peri-center and the binary evolves to\nbecome a short period binary, which eventually evolves into an LMXB. The\nformation rate of LMXBs through this channel mostly depends on the number of\nsuch BH wide binaries progenitors, which in turn depends on the velocity kicks\nimparted to BHs (or NSs) at birth. We consider several models for the formation\nand survival of such wide binaries, and calculate the LMXB formation rates for\neach model. We find that models where BHs form through direct collapse with\nno/little natal kicks can give rise to high formation rates comparable with\nthose inferred from observations. This formation scenario had several\nobservational signatures: (1) the number density of LMXBs generally follows the\nbackground stellar density and (2) the mass function of the BH stellar\ncompanion should be comparable to the mass function of the background stellar\npopulation, likely peaking at $0.4-0.6$ M$_{\\odot}$. The latter aspect, in\nparticular, is unique to this model compared with previously suggested LMXB\nformation models following common envelope binary stellar evolution. We note\nthat NS LMXBs can similarly form from wide binaries, but their formation rate\nthrough this channel is likely significantly smaller due to their much higher\nnatal kicks.\n", "  We review the structure of Roy-Steiner equations for pion-nucleon scattering,\nthe solution for the partial waves of the t-channel process $\\pi\\pi\\to \\bar N\nN$, as well as the high-accuracy extraction of the pion-nucleon S-wave\nscattering lengths from data on pionic hydrogen and deuterium. We then proceed\nto construct solutions for the lowest partial waves of the s-channel process\n$\\pi N\\to \\pi N$ and demonstrate that accurate solutions can be found if the\nscattering lengths are imposed as constraints. Detailed error estimates of all\ninput quantities in the solution procedure are performed and explicit\nparameterizations for the resulting low-energy phase shifts as well as results\nfor subthreshold parameters and higher threshold parameters are presented.\nFurthermore, we discuss the extraction of the pion-nucleon $\\sigma$-term via\nthe Cheng-Dashen low-energy theorem, including the role of isospin-breaking\ncorrections, to obtain a precision determination consistent with all\nconstraints from analyticity, unitarity, crossing symmetry, and pionic-atom\ndata. We perform the matching to chiral perturbation theory in the subthreshold\nregion and detail the consequences for the chiral convergence of the threshold\nparameters and the nucleon mass.\n", "  Superconducting systems such as those modeled by the Kitaev Hamiltonian are\nfound to exhibit the Zitterbewegung (ZB) oscillations. Remarkably, the\ndispersion relation in one-dimensional Kitaev systems allows for wavepackets of\narbitrary size undergoing non-decaying ZB without any distortion, with the\ntypical ZB amplitude being one lattice site. To motivate possible experimental\ninterest in this dynamical aspect of superconducting systems, we further show\nthat certain on-resonance modulation of the Hamiltonian parameter can be\nexploited to convert ZB oscillations to net drifting of particle's wavepacket\nand hole's wavepacket along opposite directions, leading to long-distance\nparticle-hole separation.\n", "  Neutron stars with large masses $\\sim 2M_{\\odot}$ require the hard stiffness\nof equation of state (EoS) of neutron-star matter. On the other hand, hyperon\nmixing brings about remarkable softening of EoS. In order to solve this\nproblem, a multi-pomeron exchange potential (MPP) is introduced as a model for\nthe universal many-body repulsion in baryonic systems on the basis of the\nExtended Soft Core (ESC) baryon-baryon interaction. The strength of MPP is\ndetermined by analyzing the nucleus-nucleus scattering with the G-matrix\nfolding model. The interactions in $\\Lambda\\!N$, $\\Sigma\\!N$ and $\\Xi\\!N$\nchannels are shown to be consistent with experimental indications. The EoS in\nneutron-star matter with hyperon mixing is obtained from ESC in addition of\nMPP, and mass-radius relations of neutron stars are derived. The maximum mass\nis shown to reach $2M_{\\odot}$ even in the case of including hyperon mixing on\nthe basis of model-parameters determined by terrestrial experiments.\n", "  We report on microscopic measurements of the low-energy electronic structures\nboth at zigzag and armchair edges of bilayer graphene using scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy and spectroscopy (STM and STS). We have found that, both in the\nabsence and in the presence of a magnetic field, an almost zero-energy peak in\ndensity of states was localized at zigzag edges, as expected for the surface\nstates at zigzag edges of bilayer graphene. In the quantum Hall regime, we have\nobserved clearly Landau levels bending away from the charge neutrality point\nnear both the zigzag and armchair edges. Such a result is a direct evidence for\nthe evolution of Landau levels into the quantum Hall edge states in graphene\nbilayers. Our experiment indicates that it is possible to explore rich quantum\nHall physics in graphene systems using STM and STS.\n", "  The differential cross section for proton-proton elastic scattering has been\nmeasured at a beam energy of 1.0 GeV and in 200 MeV steps from 1.6 to 2.8 GeV\nfor centre-of-mass angles in the range from 12-16 degrees to 25-30 degrees,\ndepending on the energy. Absolute normalisations of typically 3% were achieved\nby studying the energy losses of the circulating beam of the COSY storage ring\nas it passed repeatedly through the windowless hydrogen target of the ANKE\nmagnetic spectrometer. It is shown that the data have a significant impact upon\na partial wave analysis. After extrapolating the differential cross sections to\nthe forward direction, the results are broadly compatible with the predictions\nof forward dispersion relations.\n", "  It is possible to associate with every atom or molecule in a liquid its own\natomic stress tensor. These atomic stress tensors can be used to describe\nliquids' structures and to investigate the connection between structural and\ndynamic properties. In particular, atomic stresses allow to address atomic\nscale correlations relevant to the Green-Kubo expression for viscosity.\nPreviously correlations between the atomic stresses of different atoms were\nstudied using the Cartesian representation of the stress tensors or the\nrepresentation based on spherical harmonics. In this paper we address\nstructural correlations in a model 3D binary liquid using the eigenvalues and\neigenvectors of the atomic stress tensors. Thus correlations relevant to the\nGreen-Kubo expression for viscosity are interpreted in a simple geometric way.\nOn decrease of temperature the changes in the relevant stress correlation\nfunction between different atoms are significantly more pronounced than the\nchanges in the pair density function. We demonstrate that this behaviour\noriginates from the orientational correlations between the eigenvectors of the\natomic stress tensors. We also found correlations between the eigenvalues of\nthe same atomic stress tensor. For the studied system, with purely repulsive\ninteractions between the particles, the eigenvalues of every atomic stress\ntensor are positive and they can be ordered: $\\lambda_1 \\geq \\lambda_2 \\geq\n\\lambda_3 \\geq 0$. We found that, for the particles of a given type, the\nprobability distributions of the ratios $(\\lambda_2/\\lambda_1)$ and\n$(\\lambda_3/\\lambda_2)$ are essentially identical to each other in the liquids\nstate. We also found that $\\lambda_2$ tends to be equal to the geometric\naverage of $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_3$. In our view, correlations between the\neigenvalues may represent \"the Poisson ratio effect\" at the atomic scale.\n", "  In this work we review the role of hyperons on the properties of neutron and\nproto-neutron stars. In particular, we revise the so-called \"hyperon puzzle\",\ngo over some of the solutions proposed to tackle it, and discuss the\nimplications that the recent measurements of unusually high neutron star masses\nhave on our present knowledge of hypernuclear physics. We reexamine also the\nrole of hyperons on the cooling properties of newly born neutron stars and on\nthe so-called r-mode instability.\n", "  I present approximate next-to-next-to-leading-order (aNNLO)\ntransverse-momentum ($p_T$) distributions in single-top production processes.\nThe aNNLO results are derived from next-to-next-to-leading-logarithm (NNLL)\nresummation of soft-gluon corrections in the differential cross section.\nSingle-top as well as single-antitop $p_T$ distributions are shown in\n$t$-channel, $s$-channel, and $tW$ production for LHC energies.\n", "  When quantizing Conformal Dilaton Gravity there is a conformal anomaly which\nstarts at two loop order. This anomaly stems from evanescent operators on the\ndivergent parts of the effective action. The general form of the finite\ncounterterm which is necessary in order to insure cancellation of the Weyl\nanomaly to every order in perturbation theory has been determined using only\nconformal invariance . Those finite counterterms do not have any inverse power\nof any mass scale in front of them (precisely because of conformal invariance)\nand then they are not negligible in the low energy deep infrared limit. The\ngeneral form of the ensuing modifications to the scalar field equation of\nmotion has been determined and some physical consequences extracted.\n", "  Rotation-powered \"recycled\" millisecond pulsars are a variety of\nrapidly-spinning neutron stars that typically show thermal X-ray radiation due\nto the heated surface of their magnetic polar caps. Detailed numerical modeling\nof the rotation-induced thermal X-ray pulsations observed from recycled\nmillisecond pulsars, including all relevant relativistic and stellar\natmospheric effects, has been identified as a promising approach towards an\nastrophysical determination of the true neutron star mass-radius relation, and\nby extension the state of cold matter at densities exceeding those of atomic\nnuclei. Herein, I review the basic model and methodology commonly used to\nextract information regarding neutron star structure from the pulsed X-ray\nradiation observed from millisecond pulsars. I also summarize the results of\npast X-ray observations of these objects and the prospects for precision\nneutron star mass-radius measurements with the upcoming Neutron Star Interior\nComposition Explorer (NICER) X-ray timing mission.\n", "  We conduct precise strong lensing mass modeling of four ${\\it Hubble}$\nFrontier Fields (HFF) clusters, Abell$~$2744, MACS$~$J0416.1$-$2403,\nMACS$~$J0717.5$+$3745, and MACS$~$J1149.6$+$2223, for which HFF imaging\nobservations are completed. We construct a refined sample of more than 100\nmultiple images for each cluster by taking advantage of the full depth HFF\nimages, and conduct mass modeling using the ${\\small \\rm GLAFIC}$ software,\nwhich assumes simply parametrized mass distributions. Our mass modeling also\nexploits a magnification constraint from the lensed Type Ia supernova HFF14Tom\nfor Abell$~$2744 and positional constraints from the multiple images S1$-$S4 of\nthe lensed supernova SN Refsdal for MACS$~$J1149.6$+$2223. We find that our\nbest-fitting mass models reproduce the observed image positions with RMS errors\nof $\\sim 0.4$ arcsec, which are smaller than RMS errors in previous mass\nmodeling that adopted similar numbers of multiple images. Our model predicts a\nnew image of SN Refsdal with a relative time delay and magnification that are\nfully consistent with a recent detection of reappearance. We then construct\ncatalogs of $z\\sim 6-9$ dropout galaxies behind the four clusters and estimate\nmagnification factors for these dropout galaxies with our best-fitting mass\nmodels. The dropout sample from the four cluster fields contains $\\sim 120$\ngalaxies at $z\\gtrsim 6$, about 20 of which are predicted to be magnified by a\nfactor of more than 10. Some of the high-redshift galaxies detected in the HFF\nhave lensing-corrected magnitudes of $M_{\\rm UV}\\sim -15$ to $-14$. Our\nanalysis demonstrates that the HFF data indeed offer an ideal opportunity to\nstudy faint high-redshift galaxies. All lensing maps produced from our mass\nmodeling will be made available on the STScI website.\n", "  It is shown that the application of the Nikiforov-Uvarov method by Ikhdair\nfor solving the Dirac equation with the radial Rosen-Morse potential plus the\nspin-orbit centrifugal term is inadequate because the required conditions are\nnot satisfied. The energy spectra given are incorrect and the wave functions\nare not physically acceptable. We clarify the problem and prove that the spinor\nwave functions are expressed in terms of the generalized hypergeometric\nfunctions. The energy eigenvalues for the bound states are given by the\nsolution of a transcendental equation involving the hypergeometric function.\n", "  In this paper we investigate how common is the phenomenon of Finite Time\nDisentanglement (FTD) with respect to the set of quantum dynamics of bipartite\nquantum states with finite dimensional Hilbert spaces. Considering a quantum\ndynamics from a general sense, as just a continuous family of Completely\nPositive Trace Preserving maps (parametrized by the time variable) acting on\nthe space of the bipartite systems, we conjecture that FTD happens for all\ndynamics but those when all maps of the family are induced by local unitary\noperations. We prove this conjecture valid for two important cases: i) when all\nmaps are induced by unitaries; ii) for pairs of qubits, when all maps are\nunital. Moreover, we prove some general results about unitaries/CPTP maps\npreserving product/pure states\n", "  Large circular ice blocks up to 80 m of diameter have been observed on frozen\nriver around the world. This rare event has been reported in a publication in\n1993. This fascinating self-fashioned object slowly rotates at about 1$^o$ per\nsecond. In this paper, we report a model experiment consisting in a 85 mm of\ndiameter ice disc at the surface of a thermalised pool. The rotation speed has\nbeen found to increase with the bath temperature. Using particle image\nvelocimetry technique, we evidence the presence of a vortex below the ice\nblock. This vortex results from the descending flow of high density water at\n4$^o$C. The vorticity of the vortex induces the rotation of the ice block. This\nmechanism is generic of any vertical flow that generates a vortex which induces\nthe rotation of a floating object.\n", "  We present simulations of star forming filaments incorporating on of the\nlargest chemical network used to date on-the-fly in a 3D-MHD simulation. The\nnetwork contains 37 chemical species and about 300 selected reaction rates. For\nthis we use the newly developed package KROME (Grassi et al. 2014). We combine\nthe KROME package with an algorithm which allows us to calculate the column\ndensity and attenuation of the interstellar radiation field necessary to\nproperly model heating and ionisation rates. Our results demonstrate the\nfeasibility of using such a complex chemical network in 3D-MHD simulations on\nmodern supercomputers. We perform simulations with different strengths of the\ninterstellar radiation field and the cosmic ray ionisation rate. We find that\ntowards the centre of the filaments there is gradual conversion of hydrogen\nfrom H to H$_2$ as well as of C$^+$ over C to CO. Moreover, we find a decrease\nof the dust temperature towards the centre of the filaments in agreement with\nrecent HERSCHEL observations.\n", "  We discuss charged lepton flavour violating processes occurring in the\npresence of muonic atoms, such as muon-electron conversion in nuclei\n$\\text{CR}(\\mu -e, \\text{ N})$, the (Coulomb enhanced) decay of muonic atoms\ninto a pair of electrons BR($\\mu^- e^- \\to e^- e^-$, N), as well as Muonium\nconversion and decay, $\\text{Mu}-\\bar{\\text{Mu}}$ and $\\text{Mu}\\to e^+ e^-$.\nAny experimental signal of these observables calls for scenarios of physics\nbeyond the Standard Model. In this work, we consider minimal extensions of the\nStandard Model via the addition of sterile fermions, providing the\ncorresponding complete analytical expressions for all the considered\nobservables. We first consider an \"ad hoc\" extension with a single sterile\nfermion state, and investigate its impact on the above observables. Two well\nmotivated mechanisms of neutrino mass generation are then considered: the\nInverse Seesaw embedded into the Standard Model, and the $\\nu$MSM. Our study\nreveals that, depending on their mass range and on the active-sterile mixing\nangles, sterile neutrinos can give significant contributions to the above\nmentioned observables, some of them even lying within present and future\nsensitivity of dedicated cLFV experiments. We complete the analysis by\nconfronting our results to other (direct and indirect) searches for sterile\nfermions.\n", "  Quantum oscillations of metallic systems at low temperatures is one of the\nkey rules to experimentally access their electronic properties, such as energy\nspectrum, scattering mechanisms, geometry of Fermi surface and many other\nfeatures. The importance of these knowledge is enormous, since from these a\nthorough understanding of anomalous Hall effect, thermopower and Nernst\ncoefficients, just to name a few, is possible; and from those knowledge, a\nplenty of applications arise as emerging technologies. In this direction, the\npresent contribution focus on a complete description of quantum capacitance\noscillations of monolayer and bilayer graphenes under crossed electric and\nmagnetic fields. We found a closed theoretical expression for the quantum\ncapacitance and highlight their amplitude, period and phase - important\nparameters to access the electronic properties of graphenes. These results open\ndoors for further experimental studies.\n", "  Recent proposals suggest that lasers based on narrow dipole-forbidden\ntransitions in cold alkaline earth atoms could achieve linewidths that are\norders of magnitude smaller than linewidths of any existing lasers. Here, we\ndemonstrate a laser based on the 7.5 kHz linewidth dipole forbidden $^3 $P$_1$\nto $^1 $S$_0$ transition in laser-cooled and tightly confined $^{88}$Sr. We can\noperate this laser in the bad-cavity regime, where coherence is primarily\nstored in the atoms, or continuously tune to the more conventional good-cavity\nregime, where coherence is primarily stored in the light field. We show that\nthe cold-atom gain medium can be repumped to achieve quasi steady-state lasing,\nand demonstrate up to an order of magnitude suppression in the sensitivity of\nlaser frequency to changes in cavity length, the primary limitation for the\nmost frequency stable lasers today.\n", "  Measurement of the local dark matter density plays an important role in both\nGalactic dynamics and dark matter direct detection experiments. However, the\nestimated values from previous works are far from agreeing with each other. In\nthis work, we provide a well-defined observed sample with 1427 G \\& K type\nmain-sequence stars from the LAMOST spectroscopic survey, taking into account\nselection effects, volume completeness, and the stellar populations. We apply a\nvertical Jeans equation method containing a single exponential stellar disk, a\nrazor thin gas disk, and a constant dark matter density distribution to the\nsample, and obtain a total surface mass density of $\\rm {78.7 ^{+3.9}_{-4.7}\\\nM_{\\odot}\\ pc^{-2}}$ up to 1 kpc and a local dark matter density of\n$0.0159^{+0.0047}_{-0.0057}\\,\\rm M_{\\odot}\\,\\rm pc^{-3}$. We find that the\nsampling density (i.e. number of stars per unit volume) of the spectroscopic\ndata contributes to about two-thirds of the uncertainty in the estimated\nvalues. We discuss the effect of the tilt term in the Jeans equation and find\nit has little impact on our measurement. Other issues, such as a\nnon-equilibrium component due to perturbations and contamination by the thick\ndisk population, are also discussed.\n", "  Model spectra of neutron star atmospheres are nowadays widely used to fit the\nobserved thermal X-ray spectra of neutron stars. This fitting is the key\nelement in the method of the neutronstar radius determination. Here, we present\nthe basic assumptions used for the neutron star atmosphere modeling as well as\nthe main qualitative features of the stellar atmospheres leading to the\ndeviations of the emergent model spectrum from blackbody. We describe the\nproperties of two of our model atmosphere grids: (i) pure carbon atmospheres\nfor relatively cool neutron stars (1--4 MK) and (ii) hot atmospheres with\nCompton scattering taken into account. The results obtained by applying these\ngrids to model the X-ray spectra of the central compact object in supernova\nremnant HESS 1731-347, and two X-ray bursting neutron stars in low-mass X-ray\nbinaries, 4U 1724-307 and 4U 1608-52, are presented. Possible systematic\nuncertainties associated with the obtained neutron star radii are discussed.\n", "  We consider the properties of the gauge-invariant two-point correlation\nfunctions of the gauge-field strengths for QCD in the presence of a magnetic\nbackground field. We discuss the general structure of the correlators in this\ncase and provide the results of an exploratory lattice study for $N_f = 2$ QCD\ndiscretized with unimproved staggered fermions. Our analysis provides evidence\nfor the emergence of anisotropies in the non-perturbative part of the\ncorrelators and for an increase of the gluon condensate as a function of the\nexternal magnetic field.\n", "  Recently, a number of new Ward identities for large gauge transformations and\nlarge diffeomorphisms have been discovered. Some of the identities are\nreinterpretations of previously known statements, while some appear to be\ngenuinely new. We use Noether's second theorem with the path integral as a\npowerful way of generating these kinds of Ward identities. We reintroduce\nNoether's second theorem and discuss how to work with the physical remnant of\ngauge symmetry in gauge fixed systems. We illustrate our mechanism in Maxwell\ntheory, Yang-Mills theory, p-form field theory, and Einstein-Hilbert gravity.\nWe comment on multiple connections between Noether's second theorem and known\nresults in the recent literature. Our approach suggests a novel point of view\nwith important physical consequences.\n", "  Next generation gravitational wave detectors will start taking data in the\nnear future. Here we discuss the chances to detect the continuous emission from\nr-mode oscillations in compact stars and study which properties of compact\nstars we can infer from such novel data. In particular we show that the\ncombination of the gravitational wave data with electromagnetic multi-messenger\nobservations could give us detailed insight into compact star properties,\nranging from precise mass-radius measurements to the determination of the\nequation of state and the phase structure of dense matter.\n", "  The first level of folding of DNA in eukaryotes is provided by the so called\n'10 nm chromatin fibre', where DNA wraps around histone proteins (approx. 10 nm\nin size) to form nucleosomes, which go on to create a zig zagging bead on a\nstring structure. In this work we present a 1 dimensional statistical mechanics\nmodel to study nucleosome positioning within one such 10 nm fibre. We focus on\nthe case of genomic sheep DNA, and we start from effective potentials valid at\ninfinite dilution and determined from high resolution in vitro salt dialysis\nexperiments. We study positioning within a polynucleosome chain, and compare\nthe results for genomic DNA to that obtained in the simplest case of\nhomogeneous DNA, where the problem can be mapped to a Tonks gas. First, we\nconsider the simple, analytically solvable, case where nucleosomes are assumed\nto be point like. Then, we perform numerical simulations to gauge the effect of\ntheir finite size on the nucleosomal distribution probabilities. Finally we\ncompare nucleosome distributions and simulated nuclease digestion patterns for\nthe two cases (homogeneous and sheep DNA), thereby providing testable\npredictions of the effect of sequence on experimentally observable quantities\nin experiments on polynucleosome chromatin fibres reconstituted in vitro.\n", "  A method is presented to transfer a system of two-level atoms from a spin\ncoherent state to a maximally spin squeezed Dicke state, relevant for quantum\nmetrology and quantum information processing. The initial state is the ground\nstate of an initial linear Hamiltonian which is gradually turned into a final\nquadratic Hamiltonian whose ground state is the selected Dicke state. We use\ncompensating operators to suppress diabatic transitions to unwanted states that\nwould occur if the change were not slow. We discuss the possibilities of\nconstructing the compensating operators by sequential application of quadratic\nHamiltonians available in experiments.\n", "  We present an approach for testing for the existence of continuous generators\nof discrete stochastic transition matrices. Typically, the known approaches to\nascertain the existence of continuous Markov processes are based in the\nassumption that only time-homogeneous generators exist. Here, a systematic\nextension to time-inhomogeneity is presented, based in new mathematical\npropositions incorporating necessary and sufficient conditions, which are then\nimplemented computationally and applied to numerical data. A discussion\nconcerning the bridging between rigorous mathematical results on the existence\nof generators to its computational implementation. Our detection algorithm\nshows to be effective in more than $80\\%$ of tested matrices, typically $90\\%$\nto $95\\%$, and for those an estimate of the (non-homogeneous) generator matrix\nfollows. We also solve the embedding problem analytically for the particular\ncase of three-dimensional circulant matrices. Finally, a discussion of possible\napplications of our framework to problems in different fields is briefly\naddressed.\n", "  Vector-like quarks (VLQs) that are partners of the heavy top and bottom\nquarks are predicted in many extensions of the Standard Model (SM). We explore\nthe possibility that these states could explain not only the longstanding\nanomaly in the forward-backward asymmetry in $b$-quark production at LEP,\n$A_{\\rm FB}^b $, but also the more recent $\\sim 2\\sigma$ deviation of the cross\nsection for the associated Higgs production with top quark pairs at the LHC,\n$\\sigma(pp\\to t\\bar t H)$. Introducing three illustrative models for VLQs with\ndifferent representations under the SM gauge group, we show that the two\nanomalies can be resolved while satisfying all other theoretical and\nexperimental constraints. In this case, the three different models predict VLQ\nstates in the $1-2$ TeV mass range that can be soon probed at the LHC. In a\nsecond step, we discuss the sensitivity on the VLQ masses and couplings that\ncould be obtained by means of a percent level accuracy in the measurement of\nratios of partial Higgs decay widths, in particular $\\Gamma(H \\! \\to\\!\n\\gamma\\gamma)/\\Gamma(H \\! \\to\\! ZZ^*)$ and $\\Gamma(H \\! \\to \\! b\\bar\nb)/\\Gamma(H \\! \\to \\! WW^*)$. We show that top and bottom VL partners with\nmasses up to $\\sim 5$ TeV and exotic VLQs with masses in the $10$ TeV range can\nbe probed at the high-luminosity LHC.\n", "  Quasar feedback models often predict an expanding hot gas bubble which drives\na galaxy-scale outflow. In many circumstances this hot gas radiates\ninefficiently and is therefore difficult to observe directly. We present an\nindirect method to detect the presence of a hot bubble using hydrostatic\nphotoionization calculations of the cold (~10^4 K) line-emitting gas. We\ncompare our calculations with observations of the broad line region, the inner\nface of the torus, the narrow line region (NLR), and the extended NLR, and thus\nconstrain the hot gas pressure at distances 0.1 pc -- 10 kpc from the center.\nWe find that emission line ratios observed in the average quasar spectrum are\nconsistent with radiation-pressure-dominated models on all scales. On scales\n<40 pc a dynamically significant hot gas pressure is ruled out, while on larger\nscales the hot gas pressure cannot exceed six times the local radiation\npressure. In individual quasars, ~25% of quasars exhibit NLR ratios that are\ninconsistent with radiation-pressure-dominated models, though in these objects\nthe hot gas pressure is also unlikely to exceed the radiation pressure by an\norder of magnitude or more. The derived upper limits on the hot gas pressure\nimply that the instantaneous gas pressure force acting on galaxy-scale outflows\nfalls short of the time-averaged force needed to explain the large momentum\nfluxes \\dot{p} >> L_AGN/c inferred for galaxy-scale outflows. This apparent\ndiscrepancy can be reconciled if optical quasars previously experienced a\nburied, fully-obscured phase during which the hot gas bubble was more\neffectively confined and during which galactic wind acceleration occurred.\n", "  We address precision of optical interferometers fed by Gaussian states and\ninvolving passive and/or active elements, such as beam splitters,\nphotodetectors and optical parametric amplifiers. We first address the ultimate\nbounds to precision by discussing the behaviour of the quantum Fisher\ninformation. We then consider photodetection at the output and calculate the\nsensitivity of the interferometers taking into account the non unit quantum\nefficiency of the detectors. Our results show that in the ideal case of photon\nnumber detectors with unit quantum efficiency the best configuration is the\nsymmetric one, namely, passive (active) interferometer with passive (active)\ndetection stage: in this case one may achieve Heisenberg scaling of sensitivity\nby suitably optimizing over Gaussian states at the input. On the other hand, in\nthe realistic case of detectors with non unit quantum efficiency, the\nperformances of passive scheme are unavoidably degraded, whereas detectors\ninvolving optical parametric amplifiers allow to fully compensate the presence\nof loss in the detection stage, thus restoring the Heisenberg scaling.\n", "  We use sunspot group observations from the Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO)\nto investigate the effects of intercalibrating data from observers with\ndifferent visual acuities. The tests are made by counting the number of groups\n$R_B$ above a variable cut-off threshold of observed total whole-spot area\n(uncorrected for foreshortening) to simulate what a lower acuity observer would\nhave seen. The synthesised annual means of $R_B$ are then re-scaled to the\nobserved RGO group number $R_A$ using a variety of regression techniques. It is\nfound that a very high correlation between $R_A$ and $R_B$ ($r_{AB}$ > 0.98)\ndoes not prevent large errors in the intercalibration (e.g. sunspot maximum\nvalues can be over 30% too large even for such levels of $r_{AB}$). In\ngenerating the backbone sunspot number, Svalgaard and Schatten [2015] force\nregression fits to pass through the scatter plot origin which generates\nunreliable fits (the residuals do not form a normal distribution) and causes\nsunspot cycle amplitudes to be exaggerated in the intercalibrated data. It is\ndemonstrated that the use of Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plots to test for a normal\ndistribution is a useful indicator of erroneous and misleading regression fits.\nOrdinary least squares linear fits, not forced to pass through the origin, are\nsometimes reliable (although the optimum method used is shown to be different\nwhen matching peak and average sunspot group numbers). However other fits are\nonly reliable if non-linear regression is used. From these results it is\nentirely possible that the inflation of solar cycle amplitudes in the backbone\ngroup sunspot number as one goes back in time, relative to related\nsolar-terrestrial parameters, is entirely caused by the use of inappropriate\nand non-robust regression techniques to calibrate the sunspot data.\n", "  Predicting missing links in incomplete complex networks efficiently and\naccurately is still a challenging problem. The recently proposed CAR\n(Cannistrai-Alanis-Ravai) index shows the power of local link/triangle\ninformation in improving link-prediction accuracy. With the information of\nlevel-2 links, which are links between common-neighbors, most classical\nsimilarity indices can be improved. Nevertheless, calculating the number of\nlevel-2 links makes CAR index not efficient enough. Inspired by the idea of\nemploying local link/triangle information, we propose a new similarity index\nwith more local structure information. In our method, local link/triangle\nstructure information can be conveyed by clustering coefficient of common\nneighbors directly. The reason why clustering coefficient has good\neffectiveness in estimating the contribution of a common-neighbor is because\nthat it employs links existing between neighbors of the common-neighbor and\nthese links have the same structural position with the candidate link to this\ncommon-neighbor. Ten real-world networks drawn from five various fields are\nused to test the performance of our method against to classical similarity\nindices and recently proposed CAR index. Two estimators: precision and AUP, are\nused to evaluate the accuracy of link prediction algorithms. Generally\nspeaking, our new index only performs competitively with CAR, but it is a good\ncomplement to CAR for networks with not very high LCP-corr, which is a measure\nto estimate the correlation between number of common-neighbors and number of\nlinks between common-neighbors. Besides, the proposed index is also more\nefficient than CAR index.\n", "  Enhancing the optical cross section is an enticing goal in light-matter\ninteractions, due to its fundamental role in quantum and non-linear optics.\nHere, we show how dipolar interactions can suppress off-axis scattering in a\ntwo-dimensional atomic array, leading to a subradiant collective mode where the\noptical cross section is enhanced by almost an order of magnitude. As a\nconsequence, it is possible to attain an optical depth which implies high\nfidelity extinction, from a monolayer. Using realistic experimental parameters,\nwe also model how lattice vacancies and the atomic trapping depth affect the\ntransmission, concluding that such high extinction should be possible, using\ncurrent experimental techniques.\n", "  Transition from laminar to turbulent flow drastically changes the mixing,\ntransport, and drag properties of fluids, yet when and how turbulence emerges\nis elusive even for simple flow within pipes and rectangular channels. Unlike\nthe onset of temporal disorder, which is identified as the universal route to\nchaos in confined flows, characterization of the onset of spatio-temporal\ndisorder has been an outstanding challenge because turbulent domains\nirregularly decay or spread as they propagate downstream. Here, through\nextensive experimental investigation of channel flow, we identify a distinctive\ntransition with critical behavior. Turbulent domains continuously injected from\nan inlet ultimately decayed, or in contrast, spread depending on flow rates.\nNear a transition point, critical behavior was observed. We investigate both\nspatial and temporal dynamics of turbulent clusters, measuring four critical\nexponents, a universal scaling function and a scaling relation, all in\nagreement with the (2+1)-dimensional directed percolation universality class.\n", "  Stochastic processes that are randomly reset to an initial condition serve as\na showcase to investigate non-equilibrium steady states. However, all existing\nresults have been restricted to the special case of memoryless resetting\nprotocols. Here, we obtain the general solution for the distribution of\nprocesses in which waiting times between reset events are drawn from an\narbitrary distribution. This allows for the investigation of a broader class of\nmuch more realistic processes. As an example, our results are applied to the\nanalysis of the efficiency of constrained random search processes.\n", "  The astrophysical $S$-factor for the radiative capture $d(p,\\gamma)^3$He in\nthe energy-range of interest for Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) is calculated\nusing an {\\it ab-initio} approach. The nuclear Hamiltonian retains both two-\nand three-nucleon interactions - the Argonne $v_{18}$ and the Urbana IX,\nrespectively. Both one- and many-body contributions to the nuclear current\noperator are included. The former retain for the first time, besides the $1/m$\nleading order contribution ($m$ is the nucleon mass), also the next-to-leading\norder term, proportional to $1/m^3$. The many-body currents are constructed in\norder to satisfy the current conservation relation with the adopted Hamiltonian\nmodel. The hyperspherical harmonics technique is applied to solve the $A=3$\nbound and scattering states. A particular attention is used in this second case\nin order to obtain, in the energy range of BBN, an uncertainty on the\nastrophysical $S$-factor of the order or below $\\sim$1 %. Then, in this energy\nrange, the $S$-factor is found to be $\\sim$10 % larger than the currently\nadopted values.Part of this increase (1-3 %) is due to the $1/m^3$ one-body\noperator, while the remaining is due to the new more accurate scattering wave\nfunctions. We have studied the implication of this new determination for the\n$d(p,\\gamma)^3$He $S$-factor on deuterium primordial abundance. We find that\nthe predicted theoretical value for $^2$H/H is in excellent agreement with its\nexperimental determination, using the most recent determination of baryon\ndensity of Planck experiment, and with a standard number of relativistic\ndegrees of freedom $N_{\\rm eff}=3.046$ during primordial nucleosynthesis.\n", "  In the context of Self-Interacting Dark Matter as a solution for the\nsmall-scale structure problems, we consider the possibility that Dark Matter\ncould have been produced without being in thermal equilibrium with the Standard\nModel bath. We discuss one by one the following various dark matter production\nregimes of this kind: freeze-in, reannihilation and dark freeze-out. We\nexemplify how these mechanisms work in the context of the particularly simple\nHidden Vector Dark Matter model. In contrast to scenarios where there is\nthermal equilibrium with the Standard Model bath, we find two regimes which can\neasily satisfy all the laboratory and cosmological constraints. These are dark\nfreeze-out with 3-to-2 annihilations and freeze-in via a light mediator. In the\nfirst regime, different temperatures in the visible and the Dark Matter sectors\nallow us to avoid the constraints coming from cosmic structure formation as\nwell as the use of non-perturbative couplings to reproduce the observed relic\ndensity. For the second regime, different couplings are responsible for Dark\nMatter relic density and self-interactions, permitting to surpass BBN, X-ray,\nCMB and direct detection constraints.\n", "  We present GM2Calc, a public C++ program for the calculation of MSSM\ncontributions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $(g-2)_\\mu$. The\ncode computes $(g-2)_\\mu$ precisely, by taking into account the latest two-loop\ncorrections and by performing the calculation in a physical on-shell\nrenormalization scheme. In particular the program includes a $\\tan\\beta$\nresummation so that it is valid for arbitrarily high values of $\\tan\\beta$, as\nwell as fermion/sfermion-loop corrections which lead to non-decoupling effects\nfrom heavy squarks. GM2Calc can be run with a standard SLHA input file,\ninternally converting the input into on-shell parameters. Alternatively, input\nparameters may be specified directly in this on-shell scheme. In both cases the\ninput file allows one to switch on/off individual contributions to study their\nrelative impact. This paper also provides typical usage examples not only in\nconjunction with spectrum generators and plotting programs but also as C++\nsubroutines linked to other programs.\n", "  A recent ATLAS search for diboson resonances and a CMS search for $eejj$\nresonances which both show excesses with significance around 3 sigma have\ngenerated interest in $SU(2)_R$ gauge extensions of the Standard Model with a\n$W'$ mass around 2 TeV. We investigate the possibility that an $SU(2)_R$ gauge\nextension of the MSSM compatible with an explanation of the diboson anomaly\nmight give rise to a significant enhancement of the Higgs mass above the MSSM\ntree level bound $m_{h, \\text{tree}} < 90 \\; \\text{GeV}$ due to non-decoupling\nD-terms. This model contains a vector-like charge -1/3 $SU(2)_R$ singlet quark\nfor each generation which mixes significantly with the $SU(2)_R$ doublet\nquarks, affecting the $W_R$ phenomenology. We find that it is possible to\nachieve $m_{h, \\text{tree}} > 110 \\; \\text {GeV}$, and this requires that the\n$Z'$ mass is close to 3 TeV.\n", "  The Shannon information-entropy uncertainty (in brief as \"information\nuncertainty\") is used to analyze the fragments in the measured 140$A$ MeV\n$^{40, 48}$Ca + $^{9}$Be and $^{58, 64}$Ni + $^{9}$Be reactions. A scaling\nphenomenon is found in the information-uncertainty difference of fragments\nbetween the reactions. The scaling phenomenon is explained in a manner of\ncanonical ensemble theory, and is reproduced in the simulated reactions by the\nantisymmetric molecular dynamics (AMD) and AMD + GEMINI models. The probes\nbased on information uncertainty, requiring no equilibrium state of reaction,\ncan be used in the non-equilibrium system, and bridge the results of the static\nthermodynamics models and the evolving dynamical transport models.\n", "  We model the hierarchical evolution of an organized criminal network via\nantagonistic recruitment and pursuit processes. Within the recruitment phase, a\ncriminal kingpin enlists new members into the network, who in turn seek out\nother affiliates. New recruits are linked to established criminals according to\na probability distribution that depends on the current network structure. At\nthe same time, law enforcement agents attempt to dismantle the growing\norganization using pursuit strategies that initiate on the lower level nodes\nand that unfold as self-avoiding random walks. The global details of the\norganization are unknown to law enforcement, who must explore the hierarchy\nnode by node. We halt the pursuit when certain local criteria of the network\nare uncovered, encoding if and when an arrest is made; the criminal network is\nassumed to be eradicated if the kingpin is arrested. We first analyze\nrecruitment and study the large scale properties of the growing network; later\nwe add pursuit and use numerical simulations to study the eradication\nprobability in the case of three pursuit strategies, the time to first\neradication and related costs. Within the context of this model, we find that\neradication becomes increasingly costly as the network increases in size and\nthat the optimal way of arresting the kingpin is to intervene at the early\nstages of network formation. We discuss our results in the context of dark\nnetwork disruption and their implications on possible law enforcement\nstrategies.\n", "  Compression of turbulent plasma can amplify the turbulent kinetic energy, if\nthe compression is fast compared to the viscous dissipation time of the\nturbulent eddies. A sudden viscous dissipation mechanism is demonstrated,\nwhereby this amplified turbulent kinetic energy is rapidly converted into\nthermal energy, suggesting a new paradigm for fast ignition inertial fusion.\n", "  A yoke-based permanent magnet, which has been employed in many watt balances\nat national metrology institutes, is supposed to generate strong and uniform\nmagnetic field in an air gap in the radial direction. However, in reality the\nfringe effect due to the finite height of the air gap will introduce an\nundesired vertical magnetic component to the air gap, which should either be\nmeasured or modeled towards some optimizations of the watt balance. A recent\npublication, i.e., {\\it Metrologia} 52(4) 445 [1], presented a full field\nmapping method, which in theory will supply useful information for profile\ncharacterization and misalignment analysis. This article is an additional\nmaterial of [1], which develops a different analytical algorithm to represent\nthe 3D magnetic field of a watt balance magnet based on only one measurement\nfor the radial magnetic flux density along the vertical direction, $B_r(z)$.\nThe new algorithm is based on the electromagnetic nature of the magnet, which\nhas a much better accuracy.\n", "  We provide numerical support for a long-standing prediction of universal\nscaling of winding angle distributions. Simulations of interacting\nself-avoiding walks show that the winding angle distribution for $N$-step walks\nis compatible with the theoretical prediction of a Gaussian with a variance\ngrowing asymptotically as $C\\log N$, with $C=2$ in the swollen phase\n(previously verified), and $C=24/7$ at the $\\theta$-point. At low temperatures\nweaker evidence demonstrates compatibility with the same scaling and a value of\n$C=4$ in the collapsed phase, also as theoretically predicted.\n", "  High velocity stars are stars moving at velocities so high to require an\nacceleration mechanism involving binary systems or the presence of a massive\ncentral black hole. In the frame of a galaxy hosting a supermassive black hole\nbinary (of total mass $10^8$ M$_\\odot$), we investigated a mechanism for the\nproduction of high velocity stars due to the close interaction between a\nmassive and orbitally decayed globular cluster and the super massive black hole\nbinary. Some stars of the cluster acquire high velocities by conversion of\ngravitational energy into kinetic energy deriving from their interaction with\nthe black hole binary. After the interaction, few stars reach a velocity\nsufficient to overcome the galactic gravitational well, while some of them are\njust stripped from the globular cluster and start orbiting around the galactic\ncentre.\n", "  We find very good agreement between our theoretically evaluated lifetimes of\nthe $5d \\ ^2D_{3/2}$ and $5d \\ ^2D_{5/2}$ states of Cs with the experimental\nvalues reported in [Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 57}, 4204 (1998)], which were earlier\nevinced to be disagreeing with an earlier rigorous theoretical study [Phys.\nRev. A {\\bf 69}, 040501(R) (2004)] and with another precise measurement [Opt.\nLett. {\\bf 21}, 74 (1996)]. In this work, we have carried out calculations of\nthe radiative transition matrix elements using many variants of relativistic\nmany-body methods, mainly in the coupled-cluster theory framework, and analyze\npropagation of the electron correlation effects to elucidate their roles for\naccurate evaluations of the matrix elements. We also demonstrate contributions\nexplicitly from the Dirac-Coulomb interactions, frequency independent Breit\ninteraction and lower order quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects.\nUncertainties to these matrix elements due to different possible sources of\nerrors are estimated. By combining our calculated radiative matrix elements\nwith the experimental values of the transition wavelengths, we obtain the\ntransition probabilities due to both the allowed and lower order forbidden\nchannels. Adding these quantities together, the lifetimes of the above two\nstates are determined precisely and plausible reasons for the reported\ninconsistencies between the earlier theoretical calculations and the\nexperimental results have been pointed out.\n", "  We theoretically study the phenomenon of self-propulsion through Casimir\nforces in thermal non-equilibrium. Using fluctuational electrodynamics, we\nderive a formula for the self-propulsion force for an arbitrary small object in\ntwo scenarios, i) for the object being isolated, and ii) for the object being\nclose to a planar surface. In the latter case, the self-propulsion force (i.e.,\nthe force parallel to the surface) increases with decreasing distance, i.e., it\ncouples to the near-field. We numerically calculate the lateral force acting on\na hot spheroid near a surface and show that it can be as large as the\ngravitational force, thus being potentially measurable in fly-by experiments.\nWe close by linking our results to well-known relations of linear response\ntheory in fluctuational electrodynamics: Looking at the friction of the\nanisotropic object for constant velocity, we identify a correction term that is\nadditional to the typically used approach.\n", "  The metal-insulator transition has been a subject of intense research since\nNevil Mott has first proposed that the metallic behavior of interacting\nelectrons could turn to the insulating one as electron correlations increase.\nHere, we consider electrons with massless Dirac-like dispersion in two spatial\ndimensions, described by the Hubbard models on two geometrically different\nlattices, and perform numerically exact calculations on unprecedentedly large\nsystems that, combined with a careful finite size scaling analysis, allow us to\nexplore the quantum critical behavior in the vicinity of the interaction-driven\nmetal-insulator transition. We find thereby that the transition is continuous\nand determine the quantum criticality for the corresponding universality class,\nwhich is described in the continuous limit by the Gross-Neveu model, a model\nextensively studied in quantum field theory. We furthermore discuss a\nfluctuation-driven scenario for the metal-insulator transition in the\ninteracting Dirac electrons: the metal-insulator transition is triggered only\nby the vanishing of the quasiparticle weight but not the Dirac Fermi velocity,\nwhich instead remains finite near the transition. This important feature cannot\nbe captured by a simple mean-field or Gutzwiller-type approximate picture, but\nis rather consistent with the low energy behavior of the Gross-Neveu model.\n", "  The blast caused by an intense explosion has been extensively studied in\nconservative fluids, where the Taylor-von Neumann-Sedov hydrodynamic solution\nis a prototypical example of self-similarity driven by conservation laws. In\ndissipative media however, energy conservation is violated, yet a distinctive\nself-similar solution appears. It hinges on the decoupling of random and\ncoherent motion permitted by a broad class of dissipative mechanisms. This\nenforces a peculiar layered structure in the shock, for which we derive the\nfull hydrodynamic solution, validated by a microscopic approach based on\nMolecular Dynamics simulations. We predict and evidence a succession of\ntemporal regimes, as well as a long-time corrugation instability, also\nself-similar, which disrupts the blast boundary. These generic results may\napply from astrophysical systems to granular gases, and invite further\ncross-fertilization between microscopic and hydrodynamic approaches of\nshockwaves.\n", "  The diquark-triquark model is used to explain charmonium-pentaquark states,\ni.e., $P_c(4380)$ and $P_c(4450)$, which were observed recently by the LHCb\ncollaboration. For the first time, we investigate the properties of the color\nattractive configuration of a triquark and we define a nonlocal light cone\ndistribution amplitude for pentaquark states, where both diquark and triquark\nare not pointlike, but they have nonzero size. We establish an effective\ndiquark-triquark Hamiltonian based on spin-orbital interaction. According to\nthe Hamiltonian, we show that the minimum mass splitting between\n$\\frac{5}{2}^+$ and $\\frac{3}{2}^-$ is around $100$~MeV, which may naturally\nsolve the challenging problem of small mass splitting between $P_c(4450)$ and\n$P_c(4380)$. This helps to understand the peculiarities of $P_c(4380)$ with a\nbroad decay width whereas $P_c(4450)$ has a narrow decay width. Based on the\ndiquark-triquark model, we predict more pentaquark states, which will hopefully\nbe measured in future experiments.\n", "  The recently discovered dynamical phase transition denotes non-analytic\nbehavior in the real time evolution of quantum systems in the thermodynamic\nlimit and has been shown to occur in different systems at zero temperature\n[Heyl et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 135704 (2013)]. In this paper we extend the\nanalysis to non-zero temperature by studying a generalized form of the\nLoschmidt echo, the work distribution function, of a quantum quench in the\ntransverse field Ising model. Although the quantitative behavior at non-zero\ntemperatures still displays features derived from the zero temperature\nnon-analyticities, it is shown that in this model dynamical phase transitions\ndo not exist if $T>0$. This is a consequence of the system being initialized in\na thermal state. Moreover, we elucidate how the Tasaki-Crooks-Jarzynski\nrelation can be exploited as a symmetry relation for a global quench or to\nobtain the change of the equilibrium free energy density.\n", "  The next-to-leading-order electroweak corrections to $pp\\to\nl^+l^-/\\bar\\nu\\nu+\\gamma+X$ production, including all off-shell effects of\nintermediate Z bosons in the complex-mass scheme, are calculated for LHC\nenergies, revealing the typically expected large corrections of tens of percent\nin the TeV range. Contributions from quark-photon and photon-photon initial\nstates are taken into account as well, but their impact is found to be moderate\nor small. Moreover, the known next-to-leading-order QCD corrections are\nreproduced. In order to separate hard photons from jets, both a quark-to-photon\nfragmentation function \\'a la Glover/Morgan and Frixione's cone isolation are\nemployed. The calculation is available in the form of Monte Carlo programs\nallowing for the evaluation of arbitrary differential cross sections.\nPredictions for integrated cross sections are presented for the LHC at 7 TeV, 8\nTeV, and 14 TeV, and differential distributions are discussed at 14 TeV for\nbare muons and dressed leptons. Finally, we consider the impact of anomalous\n$ZZ\\gamma$ and $Z\\gamma\\gamma$ couplings.\n", "  We introduce two processes where the BMS equation appears in a context quite\ndifferent from the original context of non-global jet observables. We note the\nstrong similarities of the BMS equation to the BK and FKPP equations and argue\nthat these, essentially identical equations, can be viewed either in terms of\nthe probability, or amplitude, of something not happening or in terms of the\nnonlinear terms setting unitarity limits. Mostly analytic solutions are given\nfor (i) the probability that no $c\\bar{c}$ pairs be produced in a jet decay and\n(ii) the probability that no-$c\\bar{c}$ pairs be produced in a high energy\ndipole nucleus scattering. Both these processes obey BMS equations, albeit with\nvery different kernels.\n", "  Magnetic vortex cores exhibit a gyrotropic motion, and may reach a critical\nvelocity, at which point they invert their z-component of the magnetization. We\nperformed micromagnetic simulations to describe this vortex core polarity\nreversal in magnetic nanodisks presenting a perpendicular anisotropy. We found\nthat the critical velocity decreases with increasing perpendicular anisotropy,\ntherefore departing from a universal criterion, that relates this velocity only\nto the exchange stiffness of the material. This leads to a critical velocity\ninversely proportional to the vortex core radius. We have also shown that in a\npair of interacting disks, it is possible to switch the core vortex polarity\nthrough a non-local excitation; exciting one disk by applying a rotating\nmagnetic field, one is able to switch the polarity of a neighbor disk, with a\nlarger perpendicular anisotropy.\n", "  We apply previous results on the O(N) Bethe Ansatz [1 to 3] to construct a\ngeneral form factor formula for the O(N) Gross-Neveu model. We examine this\nformula for several operators, such as the energy momentum, the spin-field and\nthe current. We also compare these results with the 1/N expansion of this model\nand obtain full agreement. We discuss bound state form factors, in particular\nfor the three particle form factor of the field. In addition for the two\nparticle case we prove a recursion relation for the K-functions of the higher\nlevel Bethe Ansatz.\n", "  By means of transformations to nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations, we show that\na generalized short pulse equation is integrable in two (and, most probably,\nonly two) distinct cases of its coefficients. The first case is the original\nshort pulse equation (SPE). The second case, which we call the single-cycle\npulse equation (SCPE), is a previously overlooked scalar reduction of a known\nintegrable system of coupled SPEs. We get the Lax pair and bi-Hamiltonian\nstructure for the SCPE and show that the smooth envelope soliton of the SCPE\ncan be as short as only one cycle of its carrier frequency.\n", "  We construct simple solutions of three-dimensional higher spin gravity\ninteracting with matter in which only the scalar and spin-two fields are\nexcited. They preserve Lorentz symmetry and are similar to the four-dimensional\nsolutions constructed by Sezgin and Sundell, with the difference that the\nadditional twisted sectors of the three-dimensional theory are excited.\nFurthermore, the three-dimensional system contains an extra parameter $\\lambda$\nwhich allows us to vary the mass of the scalar. Among other reasons, the\nresulting solutions are interesting for the holographic study of cosmological\nsingularities: they describe the growth of a Coleman-De Luccia bubble in\nanti-de Sitter space, ending in a big crunch singularity. We initiate the\nholographic study of these solutions, finding evidence for their interpretation\nwithin a multi-trace deformation which renders the dual field theory unstable.\nThe limit $\\lambda \\to 0$ is particularly interesting as it captures effects of\na running coupling in a large-$N$ interacting fermion model. We also propose a\ngeneralization of our solutions, consisting of a dressing with\nLorentz-invariant projectors. This additional sector remains non-trivial when\nthe scalar field is turned off.\n", "  We investigate the impact of modified theories of gravity on the kinetic\nSunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect of the cosmic microwave background. We focus on\na specific class of $f(R)$ models of gravity and compare their predictions for\nthe kSZ power spectrum to that of the $\\Lambda$CDM model. We use a publicly\navailable modified version of Halofit to properly include the nonlinear matter\npower spectrum of $f(R)$ in the modeling of the kSZ signal. We find that the\nwell-known modifications of the growth rate of structure in $f(R)$ can indeed\ninduce sizable changes in the kSZ signal, which are more significant than the\nchanges induced by modifications of the expansion history. We discuss prospects\nof using the kSZ signal as a complementary probe of modified gravity, giving an\noverview of assumptions and possible caveats in the modeling.\n", "  We study the competition of spin- and charge-density waves and their quantum\nmulticritical behavior for the semimetal-insulator transitions of\nlow-dimensional Dirac fermions. Employing the effective Gross-Neveu-Yukawa\ntheory with two order parameters as a model for graphene and a growing number\nof other two-dimensional Dirac materials allows us to describe the physics near\nthe multicritical point at which the semimetallic and the spin- and\ncharge-density-wave phases meet. With the help of a functional renormalization\ngroup approach, we are able to reveal a complex structure of fixed points, the\nstability properties of which decisively depend on the number of Dirac fermions\n$N_f$. We give estimates for the critical exponents and observe crucial\nquantitative corrections as compared to the previous first-order $\\epsilon$\nexpansion. For small $N_f$, the universal behavior near the multicritical point\nis determined by the chiral Heisenberg universality class supplemented by a\ndecoupled, purely bosonic, Ising sector. At large $N_f$, a novel fixed point\nwith nontrivial couplings between all sectors becomes stable. At intermediate\n$N_f$, including the graphene case ($N_f = 2$) no stable and physically\nadmissible fixed point exists. Graphene's phase diagram in the vicinity of the\nintersection between the semimetal, antiferromagnetic and staggered density\nphases should consequently be governed by a triple point exhibiting first-order\ntransitions.\n", "  We investigate the spatial distribution of inertial particles suspended in\nthe bulk of a turbulent inhomogeneous flow. By means of direct numerical\nsimulations of particle trajectories transported by the turbulent Kolmogorov\nflow, we study large and small scale mechanisms inducing inhomogeneities in the\ndistribution of heavy particles. We discuss turbophoresis both for large and\nweak inertia, providing heuristic arguments for the functional form of the\nparticle density profile. In particular, we argue and numerically confirm that\nthe turbophoretic effect is maximal for particles of intermediate inertia. Our\nresults indicate that small-scale fractal clustering and turbophoresis peak in\ndifferent ranges in the particles' Stokes number and the separation of the two\npeaks increases with the flow's Reynolds number.\n", "  The Weyl tensor is the trace-free part of the Riemann tensor. Therefore, it\nis independent of the energy-momentum tensor and is thus not linked to the\ndynamics of gravitational fields. In this paper, we explore its possible\nthermodynamical property (i.e. its relationship with the black hole entropy).\nFor a Schwarzschild black hole, the Weyl scalar invariant,\n$C_{\\mu\\nu\\lambda\\rho}C^{\\mu\\nu\\lambda\\rho}$, is proportional to its\nBekenstein--Hawking entropy. This observation inspires us to interpret\n$C_{\\mu\\nu\\lambda\\rho}C^{\\mu\\nu\\lambda\\rho}$ as the entropy density of the\ngravitational fields of black holes. A dimensional analysis indicates that this\ninterpretation is only valid in 5-dimensional space-time. We calculate the\nvolume integrals of $C_{\\mu\\nu\\lambda\\rho}C^{\\mu\\nu\\lambda\\rho}$ for the\n5-dimensional Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild--anti-de Sitter black holes, and\nfind that these integrals indeed lead to the correct entropy formulae, only up\nto some coefficients.\n", "  Statistical characteristics of the Kraichnan direct cascade for\ntwo-dimensional hydrodynamic turbulence are numerically studied (with spatial\nresolution $8192\\times 8192$) in the presence of pumping and viscous-like\ndamping. It is shown that quasi-shocks of vorticity and their Fourier\npartnerships in the form of jets introduce an essential influence in turbulence\nleading to strong angular dependencies for correlation functions. The energy\ndistribution as a function of modulus $k$ for each angle in the inertial\ninterval has the Kraichnan behavior, $\\sim k^{-4}$, and simultaneously a strong\ndependence on angles. However, angle average provides with a high accuracy the\nKraichnan turbulence spectrum $E_k=C_K\\eta^{2/3} k^{-3}$ where $\\eta$ is\nenstrophy flux and the Kraichnan constant $C_K\\simeq 1.3$, in correspondence\nwith the previous simulations. Familiar situation takes place for third-order\nvelocity structure function $S_3^L$ which, as for the isotropic turbulence,\ngives the same scaling with respect to separation length $R$ and $\\eta$,\n$S_3^L=C_3\\eta R^3$, but the mean over angles and time $\\bar {C_3}$ differs\nfrom its isotropic value.\n", "  Under the action of pump light, the conventional photonic crystal can be\nturned into function photonic crystal. In the paper, we have designed optical\ntriode with one-dimensional function photonic crystal, and analyzed the effect\nof period number, medium thickness and refractive index, incident angle, the\nirradiation way and intensity of pump light on the optical triode\nmagnification. We obtain some valuable results, which shall help to optimal\ndesign optical triode.\n", "  Momentum dissipation is an important ingredient in condensed matter physics\nthat requires a translation breaking sector. In the bottom-up gauge/gravity\nduality, this implies that the gravity dual is massive. We start here a\nsystematic analysis of holographic massive gravity (HMG) theories, which admit\nfield theory dual interpretations and which, therefore, might store interesting\ncondensed matter applications. We show that there are many phases of HMG that\nare fully consistent effective field theories and which have been left\noverlooked in the literature. The most important distinction between the\ndifferent HMG phases is that they can be clearly separated into solids and\nfluids. This can be done both at the level of the unbroken spacetime symmetries\nas well as concerning the elastic properties of the dual materials. We extract\nthe modulus of rigidity of the solid HMG black brane solutions and show how it\nrelates to the graviton mass term. We also consider the implications of the\ndifferent HMGs on the electric response. We show that the types of response\nthat can be consistently described within this framework is much wider than\nwhat is captured by the narrow class of models mostly considered so far.\n", "  Giant impurity excitations with large binding energies are powerful probes\nfor exploring new regimes of far out of equilibrium dynamics in few- and\nmany-body quantum systems, as well as for in-situ observations of correlations.\nMotivated by recent experimental progress in spectroscopic studies of Rydberg\nexcitations in ensembles of ultracold atoms, we develop a new theoretical\napproach for describing multiscale dynamics of Rydberg excitations in quantum\nBose gases. We find that the crossover from few- to many-body dynamics\nmanifests in a dramatic change in spectral profile from resolved molecular\nlines to broad Gaussian distributions representing a superpolaronic state in\nwhich many atoms bind to the Rydberg impurity. We discuss signatures of this\ncrossover in the temperature and density dependence of the spectra.\n", "  The sensitivity of Pulsar Timing Arrays to gravitational waves depends on the\nnoise present in the individual pulsar timing data. Noise may be either\nintrinsic or extrinsic to the pulsar. Intrinsic sources of noise will include\nrotational instabilities, for example. Extrinsic sources of noise include\ncontributions from physical processes which are not sufficiently well modelled,\nfor example, dispersion and scattering effects, analysis errors and\ninstrumental instabilities. We present the results from a noise analysis for 42\nmillisecond pulsars (MSPs) observed with the European Pulsar Timing Array. For\ncharacterising the low-frequency, stochastic and achromatic noise component, or\n\"timing noise\", we employ two methods, based on Bayesian and frequentist\nstatistics. For 25 MSPs, we achieve statistically significant measurements of\ntheir timing noise parameters and find that the two methods give consistent\nresults. For the remaining 17 MSPs, we place upper limits on the timing noise\namplitude at the 95% confidence level. We additionally place an upper limit on\nthe contribution to the pulsar noise budget from errors in the reference\nterrestrial time standards (below 1%), and we find evidence for a noise\ncomponent which is present only in the data of one of the four used telescopes.\nFinally, we estimate that the timing noise of individual pulsars reduces the\nsensitivity of this data set to an isotropic, stochastic GW background by a\nfactor of >9.1 and by a factor of >2.3 for continuous GWs from resolvable,\ninspiralling supermassive black-hole binaries with circular orbits.\n", "  We develop a kinetic equation approach to nonequilibrium pion and sigma meson\nproduction in a time-dependent, chiral symmetry breaking field (inertial\nmechanism). We investigate the question to what extent the low-momentum pion\nenhancement observed in heavy-ion collisions at CERN - LHC can be addressed\nwithin this formalism. In a first step, we consider the inertial mechanism for\nnonequilibrium production of $\\sigma-$mesons and their simultaneous decay into\npion pairs for two cases of $\\sigma$ mass evolution. The resulting pion\ndistribution shows a strong low-momentum enhancement which can be approximated\nby a thermal Bose distribution with a chemical potential that appears as a\ntrace of the nonequilibrium process of its production.\n", "  We study the cut-off phenomenon for a family of stochastic small\nperturbations of a one dimensional dynamical system. We will focus in a\nsemi-flow of a deterministic differential equation which is perturbed by adding\nto the dynamics a white noise of small variance. Under suitable hypothesis on\nthe potential we will prove that the family of perturbed stochastic\ndifferential equations present a profile cut-off phenomenon with respect to the\ntotal variation distance. We also prove a local cut-off phenomenon in a\nneighborhood of the local minima (metastable states) of multi-well potential.\n", "  A continuous deformation of a Hamiltonian possessing at low energy two Dirac\npoints of opposite chiralities can lead to a gap opening by merging of the two\nDirac points. In two dimensions, the critical Hamiltonian possesses a\nsemi-Dirac spectrum: linear in one direction but quadratic in the other. We\nstudy the transport properties across such a transition, from a Dirac\nsemi-metal through a semi-Dirac phase towards a gapped phase. Using both a\nBoltzmann approach and a diagrammatic Kubo approach, we describe the\nconductivity tensor within the diffusive regime. In particular, we show that\nboth the anisotropy of the Fermi surface and the Dirac nature of the\neigenstates combine to give rise to anisotropic transport times, manifesting\nthemselves through an unusual matrix self-energy.\n", "  Searches of the electric dipole moment (EDM) at a pure magnetic ring, like\nCOSY, encounter strong background coming from magnetic dipole moment (MDM). The\nmost troubling issue is the MDM spin rotation in the so-called imperfection,\nradial and longitudinal, B-fields. To study the systematic effects of the\nimperfection fields at COSY we proposed the original method which makes use of\nthe two static solenoids acting as artificial imperfections. Perturbation of\nthe spin tune caused by the spin kicks in the solenoids probes the systematic\neffect of cumulative spin rotation in the imperfection fields all over the\nring. The spin tune is one of the most precise quantities measured presently at\nCOSY at $10^{-10}$ level. The method has been successfully tested in September\n2014 run at COSY, unravelling strength of spin kicks in the ring's imperfection\nfields at the level of $10^{-3} rad$.\n", "  The electronics of the LZ experiment, the 7-tonne dark matter detector to be\ninstalled at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), is designed to\npermit studies of physics where the energies deposited range from 1 keV of\nnuclear-recoil energy up to 3,000 keV of electron-recoil energy. The system is\ndesigned to provide a 70% efficiency for events that produce three\nphotoelectrons in the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). This corresponds\napproximately to the lowest energy threshold achievable in multi-tonne\ntime-projection chambers, and drives the noise specifications for the front\nend. The upper limit of the LZ dynamic range is defined to accommodate the\nelectroluminescence (S2) signals. The low-energy channels of the LZ amplifiers\nprovide the dynamic range required for the tritium and krypton calibrations.\nThe high-energy channels provide the dynamic range required to measure the\nactivated Xe lines.\n", "  In the present work the Mott effect for pions and kaons is described within a\nBeth- Uhlenbeck approach on the basis of the PNJL model. The contribution of\nthese degrees of freedom to the thermodynamics is encoded in the temperature\ndependence of their phase shifts. A comparison with results from $N_f = 2 + 1$\nlattice QCD thermodynamics is performed.\n", "  We study Yang-Baxter deformations of the Nappi-Witten model with a\nprescription invented by Delduc, Magro and Vicedo. The deformations are\nspecified by skew-symmetric classical $r$-matrices satisfying (modified)\nclassical Yang-Baxter equations. We show that the sigma-model metric is\ninvariant under arbitrary deformations (while the coefficient of $B$-field is\nchanged) by utilizing the most general classical $r$-matrix. Furthermore, the\ncoefficient of $B$-field is determined to be the original value from the\nrequirement that the one-loop $\\beta$-function should vanish. After all, the\nNappi-Witten model is the unique conformal theory within the class of the\nYang-Baxter deformations preserving the conformal invariance.\n", "  Identifying the most influential spreaders is an important issue in\ncontrolling the spreading processes in complex networks. Centrality measures\nare used to rank node influence in a spreading dynamics. Here we propose a node\ninfluence measure based on the centrality of a node and its neighbors'\ncentrality, which we call the neighborhood centrality. By simulating the\nspreading processes in six real-world networks, we find that the neighborhood\ncentrality greatly outperforms the basic centrality of a node such as the\ndegree and coreness in ranking node influence and identifying the most\ninfluential spreaders. Interestingly, we discover a saturation effect in\nconsidering the neighborhood of a node, which is not the case of the larger the\nbetter. Specifically speaking, considering the 2-step neighborhood of nodes is\na good choice that balances the cost and performance. If further step of\nneighborhood is taken into consideration, there is no obvious improvement and\neven decrease in the ranking performance. The saturation effect may be\ninformative for studies that make use of the local structure of a node to\ndetermine its importance in the network.\n", "  We investigate all feasible mathematical representations of disformal\ntransformations on a space-time metric according to the action of a linear\noperator upon the manifold's tangent and cotangent bundles. The geometric,\nalgebraic and group structures of this operator and their interfaces are\nanalyzed in detail. Then, we scrutinize a possible physical application,\nproviding a new covariant formalism for a phenomenological approach to quantum\ngravity known as Rainbow Gravity.\n", "  We quantify the contamination from polarized diffuse Galactic synchrotron and\nthermal dust emissions to the B-modes of the CMB anisotropies on the degree\nangular scale, using data from the Planck and WMAP satellites. We compute power\nspectra of foreground polarized emissions in 352 circular sky patches located\nat Galactic latitude |b|>20{\\deg}, each of which covering a fraction of the sky\nof about 1.5%. We make use of the spectral properties derived from Planck and\nWMAP data to extrapolate, in frequency, the amplitude of synchrotron and\nthermal dust B-modes spectra in the multipole bin centered at $\\ell\\simeq80$.\nIn this way we estimate, for each analyzed region, the amplitude and frequency\nof the foreground minimum. We detect both dust and synchrotron signal, at\ndegree angular scale and at 3 confidence level, in 28 regions. Here the minimum\nof the foreground emission is found at frequencies between 60 and 100 GHz with\nan amplitude,expressed in terms of the equivalent tensor-to-scalar ratio, r_FG,\nbetween ~0.06 and ~1. Some of these regions are located at high Galactic\nlatitudes, in areas close to the ones which are being observed by sub-orbital\nexperiments.In all the other sky patches, where synchrotron or dust B-modes are\nnot detectable with the required confidence, we put upper limits on the minimum\nforeground contamination and find values of r_FG between ~0.05 and ~1.5, in the\nfrequency range 60-90 GHz. Our results indicate that, with the current\nsensitivity at low frequency, it is not possible to exclude the presence of\nsynchrotron contamination to CMB cosmological B-modes at the level requested to\nmeasure a gravitational waves signal with r~0.01, at frequency <100 GHz,\nanywhere. Therefore, more accurate data are essential in order to better\ncharacterize the synchrotron polarized component, and eventually, remove its\ncontamination to CMB signal through foreground cleaning.\n", "  In this letter we analyze an optical Fabry-P\\'erot resonator as a\ntime-periodic driving of the (2D) optical field repeatedly traversing the\nresonator, uncovering that resonator twist produces a synthetic magnetic field\napplied to the light within the resonator, while mirror aberrations produce\nrelativistic dynamics, anharmonic trapping, and spacetime curvature. We develop\na Floquet formalism to compute the effective Hamiltonian for the 2D field,\ngeneralizing the idea that the intra-cavity optical field corresponds to an\nensemble of non-interacting, massive, harmonically trapped particles. This work\nilluminates the extraordinary potential of optical resonators for exploring the\nphysics of quantum fluids in gauge fields and exotic space-times.\n", "  Excitation of coherent optical phonons in solids provides a pathway for\nultrafast modulation of light on a sub-ps timescale. Here, we report on\nefficient 3.6 THz modulation of light reflected from hybrid metal/semiconductor\nplasmonic crystals caused by lattice vibrations in a few nm thick layer of\nelemental tellurium. We observe that surface plasmon polaritons contribute\nsignificantly to photoinduced formation of this thin layer at the interface\nbetween a telluride-based II-VI semiconductor, such as (Cd,Mg)Te or (Cd,Mn)Te,\nand a one-dimensional gold grating. The change in interface composition is\nmonitored via the excitation and detection of coherent optical tellurium\nphonons of $A_1$ symmetry by femtosecond laser pulses in a pump-probe\nexperiment. The patterning of a plasmonic grating onto the semiconductor\nenhances the transient signal which originates from the interface region. This\nallows monitoring the layer formation and observing the shift of the phonon\nfrequency caused by confinement of the lattice vibrations in the nm-thick\nsegregated layer. Efficient excitation and detection of coherent optical\nphonons by means of surface plasmon polaritons are evidenced by the dependence\nof the signal strength on polarization of pump and probe pulses and its\nspectral distribution.\n", "  We use supersymmetric localization to study probes of four dimensional\nLagrangian N=2 superconformal field theories. We first derive a unique equation\nfor the eigenvalue density of these theories. We observe that these theories\nhave a Wigner eigenvalue density precisely when they satisfy a necessary\ncondition for having a holographic dual with a sensible higher-derivative\nexpansion. We then compute in the saddle-point approximation the vacuum\nexpectation value of 1/2-BPS circular Wilson loops, and the two-point functions\nof these Wilson loops with the Lagrangian density and with the stress-energy\ntensor. This last computation also provides the corresponding Bremsstrahlung\nfunctions and entanglement entropies. As expected, whenever a finite fraction\nof the matter is in the fundamental representation, the results are drastically\ndifferent from those of N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.\n", "  A model for the slow dynamics of the supercooled liquid is formulated in\nterms of the standard equations of fluctuating nonlinear hydrodynamics (FNH)\nwith the inclusion of an extra diffusive mode for the collective density\nfluctuations. If the compressible nature of the liquid is completely ignored,\nthis diffusive mode sets the longest relaxation times in the supercooled state\nand smooths off a possible sharp ergodicity-nonergodicity (ENE) transition\npredicted in a mode coupling theory. The scenario changes when the complete\ndynamics is considered with the inclusion of $1/\\rho$ nonlinearities in the FNH\nequations, reflecting the compressible nature of the liquid. The latter\nprimarily determines the extent of slowing down in the supercooled liquid. The\npresence of slow diffusive modes in the supercooled liquid do not give rise to\nvery long relaxation times unless the role of couplings between density and\ncurrents in the compressible liquid is negligible.\n", "  We consider the production of a single $Z$ or $W$ boson in association with\njets at the LHC. We compute the corresponding cross sections by matching NLO\nQCD predictions with the Herwig++ and Pythia8 parton showers, and by merging\nall of the underlying matrix elements with up to two light partons at the Born\nlevel. We compare our results with several 7-TeV measurements by the ATLAS and\nCMS collaborations, and overall we find a good agreement between theory and\ndata.\n", "  Due to their high potentiality for photovoltaic applications or coherent\nlight sources, a renewed interest in hybrid organic perovskites has emerged for\nfew years. When they are arranged in two dimensions, these materials can be\nconsidered as hybrids quantum wells. One consequence of the unique structure of\n2D hybrid organic perovskites is a huge exciton binding energy that can be\ntailored through chemical engineering. We present experimental investigations\nof the exciton nonlinearities by means of femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy.\nThe exciton dynamics is fitted with a bi-exponential decay with a free exciton\nlife-time of ~100 ps. Moreover, an ultrafast intraband relaxation (< 150 fs) is\nalso reported. Finally, the transient modification of the excitonic line is\nanalysed through the momenta analysis and described in terms of reduction of\nthe oscillator strength and linewidth broadening. We show that excitonic\nnon-linearities in 2D hybrid organic perovskites share some behaviours of\ninorganic semiconductors despite their huge exciton binding energy.\n", "  We calculate the production and decay rates of the Higgs boson at the LHC in\nthe context of general 5 dimensional (5D) warped scenarios with a spacetime\nbackground modified from the usual $AdS_5$, with SM fields propagating in the\nbulk. We extend previous work by considering the full flavor structure of the\nSM, and thus including all possible flavor effects coming from mixings with\nheavy fermions. We proceed in three different ways, first by only including two\ncomplete Kaluza-Klein (KK) levels ($15\\times15$ fermion mass matrices), then\nincluding three complete KK levels ($21\\times21$ fermion mass matrices) and\nfinally we compare with the effect of including the infinite (full) KK towers.\nWe present numerical results for the Higgs production cross section via gluon\nfusion and Higgs decay branching fractions in both the modified metric scenario\nand in the usual Randall-Sundrum metric scenario.\n", "  An inhomogeneous transport current, which is introduced through multiple\nelectrodes in an open Nb microtube, is shown to lead to a controllable\nbranching of the vortex nucleation period. The detailed mechanism of this\nbranching is analyzed using the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation. The\nrelative change of the vortex nucleation period strongly depends on the\ngeometry of multiple electrodes. The average number of vortices occurring in\nthe tube in a nanosecond can be effectively reduced owing to the inhomogeneous\ntransport current, what is important for noise and energy dissipation reduction\nin superconductor applications, e.g., for an extension of the operation regime\nof superconductor-based sensors to lower frequencies.\n", "  The definition of the classical transition state theory (TST) as a t= 0+\nlimit of the flux-side time correlation function relies on the assumption that\nsimultaneous measurement of population and flux is a well defined physical\nprocess. However, the noncommutativity of the two measurements in quantum\nmechanics makes the extension of such a concept to the quantum regime\nimpossible. For this reason, quantum TST (QTST) has been generally accepted as\nany kind of quantum rate theory reproducing the TST in the classical limit, and\nthere has been a broad consensus that no unique QTST retaining all the\nproperties of TST can be defined. Hele and Althorpe (HA) [J. Chem. Phys. 138,\n084108 (2013)] recently suggested that a true QTST can be defined as the exact\nt=0+ limit of a certain kind of quantum flux-side time correlation function and\nthat it is equivalent to the ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) TST. This\nwork seeks to question and clarify certain assumptions underlying these\nsuggestions and their implications. First, the time correlation function used\nby HA as a starting expression is not related to the kinetic rate constant by\nvirtue of linear response theory, which is the first important step in relating\na t=0+ limit to a physically measurable rate. Second, a theoretical analysis\ncalls into question a key step in HA's proof which appears not to rely on an\nexact quantum mechanical identity. The correction of this makes the true t=0+\nlimit of HA's QTST different from the RPMD-TST rate expression, but rather\nequal to the well-known path integral quantum transition state theory rate\nexpression for the case of centroid dividing surface. An alternative path\nintegral quantum rate expression is then formulated based on the linear\nresponse theory. It is shown that the t=0+ limit of the new rate expression\nvanishes in the exact quantum limit.\n", "  We compute the one-loop S-matrix for the light bosonic excitations of the GKP\nstring at strong coupling. These correspond, on the gauge theory side, to gluon\ninsertions in the GKP vacuum. We perform the calculation by Feynman diagrams in\nthe worldsheet theory and we compare the result to the integrability\nprediction, finding perfect agreement for the scheme independent part. For\nscheme dependent rational terms we test different schemes and find that a\nrecent proposal reproduces exactly the integrability prediction.\n", "  In composite Higgs models (CHMs), electroweak precision data generically push\ncolourless composite vector resonances to a regime where they dominantly decay\ninto pairs of light top partners. This greatly attenuates their traces in\ncanonical collider searches, tailored for narrow resonances promptly decaying\ninto Standard Model final states. By reinterpreting the CMS same-sign dilepton\n(SS2$\\ell$) analysis at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), originally designed to\nsearch for top partners with electric charge $5/3$, we demonstrate its\nsignificant coverage over this kinematical regime. We also show the reach of\nthe 13 TeV run of the LHC, with various integrated luminosity options, for a\npossible upgrade of the SS2$\\ell$ search. The top sector of CHMs is found to be\nmore fine-tuned in the presence of colourless composite resonances in the few\nTeV range.\n", "  A supra-massive neutron star (NS) spinning extremely rapidly could survive\nfrom a merger of NS-NS binary. The spin-down of this remnant NS that is highly\nmagnetized would power the isotropic merger ejecta to produce a bright\nmergernova emission in ultraviolet/optical bands. Before the mergernova, the\nearly interaction between the NS wind and the ejecta can drive a forward shock\npropagating outwards into the ejecta. As a result, a remarkable amount of heat\ncan be accumulated behind the shock front and the final escaping of this heat\ncan produce a shock breakout emission. We describe the dynamics and thermal\nemission of this shock with a semi-analytical model. It is found that sharp and\nluminous breakout emission appears mainly in soft X-rays with a luminosity of\n$\\sim10^{45}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$ at a few hours after the merger, by leading the\nmergernova emission as a precursor. Therefore, detection of such an X-ray\nprecursor would provide a smoking-gun evidence for identifying NS-powered\nmergernovae and distinguishing them from the radioactive-powered ones (i.e.,\nkilonovae or macronovae). The discovery of NS-powered mergernovae would finally\nhelp to confirm the gravitational wave signals due to the mergers and the\nexistence of supra-massive NSs.\n", "  We consider a set of identical mobile point-like charges (counter-ions)\nconfined to a domain with curved hard walls carrying a uniform fixed surface\ncharge density, the system as a whole being electroneutral. Three domain\ngeometries are considered: a pair of parallel plates, the cylinder and the\nsphere. The particle system in thermal equilibrium is assumed to be described\nby the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann theory. While the effectively 1D plates and\nthe 2D cylinder have already been solved, the 3D sphere problem is not\nintegrable. It is shown that the contact density of particles at the charged\nsurface is determined by a first-order Abel differential equation of the second\nkind which is a counterpart of Enig's equation in the critical theory of\ngravitation and combustion/explosion. This equation enables us to construct the\nexact series solutions of the contact density in the regions of small and large\nsurface charge densities. The formalism provides, within the mean-field\nPoisson-Boltzmann framework, the complete thermodynamics of counter-ions inside\na charged sphere (salt-free system).\n", "  We theoretically investigate the coupling of an ultracold three-level atomic\ngas and a nano-mechanical mirror via classical electromagnetic radiation. The\nradiation pressure on the mirror is modulated by absorption of a probe light\nfield, caused by the atoms which are electromagnetically rendered nearly\ntransparent, allowing the gas to affect the mirror. In turn, the mirror can\naffect the gas as its vibrations generate opto-mechanical sidebands in the\ncontrol field. We show that the sidebands cause modulations of the probe\nintensity at the mirror frequency, which can be enhanced near atomic\nresonances. Through the radiation pressure from the probe beam onto the mirror,\nthis results in resonant driving of the mirror. Controllable by the two photon\ndetuning, the phase relation of the driving to the mirror motion decides upon\namplification or damping of mirror vibrations. This permits direct phase\nlocking of laser amplitude modulations to the motion of a nano-mechanical\nelement opening a perspective for cavity-free cooling through coupling to an\natomic gas.\n", "  We use the Heat Kernel method to calculate the Entanglement Entropy for a\ngiven entangling region on a fractal. The leading divergent term of the entropy\nis obtained as a function of the fractal dimension as well as the walk\ndimension. The power of the UV cut-off parameter is (generally) a fractional\nnumber which indeed is a certain combination of these two indices. This\nexponent is known as the spectral dimension. We show that there is a novel\n$\\log$ periodic oscillatory behavior in the expression of entropy which has\nroot in the complex dimension of the fractal. We finally indicate that the\nHolographic calculation in a certain hyper-scaling violating bulk geometry\nyields the same leading term for the entanglement entropy, if one identifies\nthe effective dimension of the hyper-scaling violating theory with the spectral\ndimension of the fractal. We provide more supports with comparing the behavior\nof the thermal entropy in terms of the temperature computed for a fractal\ngeometry and a hyper-scaling violating theory as well.\n", "  We determine the impact of resource renewal on the lifetime of a forager that\ndepletes its environment and starves if it wanders too long without eating. In\nthe framework of the minimal starving random walk model with resource renewal,\nthere are three universal classes of behavior as a function of the renewal\ntime. For sufficiently rapid renewal, foragers are immortal, while foragers\nhave a finite lifetime otherwise. In one dimension, there is a third regime,\nfor sufficiently slow renewal, in which the lifetime of the forager is\nindependent of the renewal time. We outline an enumeration method to determine\nthe mean lifetime of the forager in the mortal regime.\n", "  Einstein equations projected on to a black hole horizon gives rise to\nNavier-Stokes equations. Horizon-fluids typically possess unusual features like\nnegative bulk viscosity and it is not clear whether a statistical mechanical\ndescription exists for such fluids. In this work, we provide an explicit\nderivation of the Bulk viscosity of the horizon-fluid based on the theory of\nfluctuations a la Kubo. The main advantage of our approach is that our analysis\nremains for the most part independent of the details of the underlying\nmicroscopic theory and hence the conclusions reached here are model\nindependent. We show that the coefficient of bulk viscosity for the\nhorizon-fluid matches exactly with the value found from the equations of motion\nfor the horizon-fluid.\n", "  We study the scalar curvature of spacelike hypersurfaces in the family of\ncosmological models known as generalized Robertson-Walker spacetimes, and give\nseveral rigidity results under appropriate mathematical and physical\nassumptions. On the other hand, we show that this family of spacetimes provides\nsuitable models obeying the null convergence condition to explain accelerated\nexpanding universes.\n", "  Linear halo bias is the response of dark matter halo number density to a long\nwavelength fluctuation in the dark matter density. Using abundance matching\nbetween separate universe simulations which absorb the latter into a change in\nthe background, we test the consistency relation between the change in a one\npoint function, the halo mass function, and a two point function, the\nhalo-matter cross correlation in the long wavelength limit. We find excellent\nagreement between the two at the $1-2\\%$ level for average halo biases between\n$1 \\lesssim \\bar b_1 \\lesssim 4$ and no statistically significant deviations at\nthe $4-5\\%$ level out to $\\bar b_1 \\approx 8$. Halo bias inferred assuming\ninstead a universal mass function is significantly different and inaccurate at\nthe 10\\% level or more. The separate universe technique provides a way of\ncalibrating linear halo bias efficiently for even highly biased rare halos in\nthe $\\Lambda$CDM model. Observational violation of the consistency relation\nwould indicate new physics, e.g.~in the dark matter, dark energy or primordial\nnon-Gaussianity sectors.\n", "  Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers can couple to confined phonons in diamond\nmechanical resonators via the effect of lattice strain on their energy levels.\nAccess to the strong spin-phonon coupling regime with this system requires\nresonators with nanoscale dimensions in order to overcome the weak strain\nresponse of the NV ground state spin sublevels. In this work, we study NVs in\ndiamond cantilevers with lateral dimensions of a few hundred nm. Coupling of\nthe NV ground state spin to the mechanical mode is detected in electron spin\nresonance (ESR), and its temporal dynamics are measured via spin echo. Our\nsmall mechanical mode volume leads to a 10-100X enhancement in spin-phonon\ncoupling strength over previous NV-strain coupling demonstrations. This is an\nimportant step towards strong spin-phonon coupling, which can enable\nphonon-mediated quantum information processing and quantum metrology.\n", "  Large-amplitude Alfv\\'en waves are observed in various systems in space and\nlaboratories, demonstrating an interesting property that the wave shapes are\nstable even in the nonlinear regime. The ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model\npredicts that an Alfv\\'en wave keeps an arbitrary shape constant when it\npropagates on a homogeneous ambient magnetic field. However, such arbitrariness\nis an artifact of the idealized model that omits the dispersive effects. Only\nspecial wave forms, consisting of two component sinusoidal functions, can\nmaintain the shape; we derive fully nonlinear Alfv\\'en waves by an extended MHD\nmodel that includes both the Hall and electron inertia effects. Interestingly,\nthese \\small-scale effects\" change the picture completely; the large-scale\ncomponent of the wave cannot be independent of the small scale component, and\nthe coexistence of them forbids the large scale component to have a free wave\nform. This is a manifestation of the nonlinearity-dispersion interplay, which\nis somewhat different from that of solitons.\n", "  We investigate dynamic properties of bouncing and penetration in colliding\nbinary and ternary Bose-Einstein condensates comprised of different Zeeman or\nhyperfine states of 87Rb. Through the application of magnetic field gradient\npulses, two- or three-component condensates in an optical trap are spatially\nseparated and then made to collide. The subsequent evolutions are classified\ninto two categories: repeated bouncing motion and mutual penetration after\ndamped bounces. We experimentally observed mutual penetration for immiscible\ncondensates, bouncing between miscible condensates, and domain formation for\nmiscible condensates. From numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii\nequation, we find that the penetration time can be tuned by slightly changing\nthe atomic interaction strengths.\n", "  In this work we present results from NPT(isobaric-isothermal) Monte Carlo\nSimulation studies of Liquid Crystalline Dendrimer (LCDr) systems confined in a\nslit-pore made of two parallel flat walls. We investigate the substrate induced\nconformational and alignment properties of the system at different\nthermodynamic state points under uniform (unidirectional) anchoring condition.\nTractable coarse grained force fields to model both monomer-monomer and\nmonomer-substrate interaction potentials have been used from our previous work.\nIn this anchoring condition, at lower pressure almost all the monomers are\nanchored to the substrates and mesogens are perfectly aligned with the aligning\ndirection. This alignment is not uniformly transmitted to the bulk region as\nthe pressure grows, instead, it decays with distance from the surface to the\nbulk region. Due to this reason, the global orintational order parameter\ndecreases with increasing pressure (density). In the neighborhood (2-3\nmesogenic diameter) of upper and lower walls, mesogenic units form smectic A\nlike structure whose layers are separated by layers of spherical beads. In this\nregion individual LCDrs possess a rod like shape.\n", "  The Projection on Proper elements (PoPe) is a novel method of code control\ndedicated to 1) checking the correct implementation of models, 2) determining\nthe convergence of numerical methods and 3) characterizing the residual errors\nof any given solution at very low cost. The basic idea is to establish a\nbijection between a simulation and a set of equations that generate it.\nRecovering equations is direct and relies on a statistical measure of the\nweight of the various operators. This method can be used in any dimensions and\nany regime, including chaotic ones. This method also provides a procedure to\ndesign reduced models and quantify the ratio costs to benefits. PoPe is applied\nto a kinetic and a fluid code of plasma turbulence.\n", "  General neutrino-scalar couplings appear in many extensions of Standard\nModel. We can probe these neutrino-scalar couplings by leptonic decay of mesons\nand from heavy neutrino search. Our analysis improves the present limits to\n$|g_e|^2<1.9\\times 10^{-6}$ and $|g_\\mu|^2<1.9\\times 10^{-7}$ at 90\\% C.L. for\nmassless scalars. For massive scalars we found for the first time the\nconstraints for $g^2_{\\alpha}$ couplings to be $10^{-6}-10^{-1}$ respectively\nfor scalar masses between below 1 MeV and for 300 MeV.\n", "  We revisit the rare leptonic decay $B_s \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ in the two-Higgs\ndoublet models with a softly broken $Z_2$ symmetry, namely type-I, type-II,\ntype-X and type-Y 2HDMs. We have derived the relevant full one-loop Wilson\ncoefficients of the four 2HDMs from the recent calculation in the aligned\ntwo-Higgs doublet model by Li, Lu and Pich, which could be mapped to all the\nfour 2HDMs for both large and small $\\tan\\beta$. It is found that, a new term\nassociated with the soft $Z_2$ symmetry breaking parameter $M$ can be enhanced\nby $\\tan^2\\beta$ in the type-II 2HDM, which has not been considered in the\nliterature. Imposing both theoretical and experimental constraints, we have\nrenewed the bounds on the parameter spaces of the four 2HDMs. Different from\nour previous paper, however, we find that all the four 2HDMs give sizable and\nsimilar contributions to $\\overline{\\mathcal B}(B_s \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-)$ within\nthe stringently restricted parameter spaces, but very tiny as regards the\nmass-eigenstate rate asymmetry $\\mathcal A_{\\Delta\\Gamma}$; this makes it\nunfeasible to discriminate the four types of 2HDM with the correlations between\nthe observables in $B_s \\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ decay.\n", "  Non-abelian discrete symmetries are of particular importance in model\nbuilding. They are mainly invoked to explain the various fermion mass\nhierarchies and forbid dangerous superpotential terms. In string models they\nare usually associated to the geometry of the compactification manifold and\nmore particularly to the magnetised branes in toroidal compactifications.\nMotivated by these facts, in this note we propose a unified framework to\nconstruct representations of finite discrete family groups based on the\nautomorphisms of the discrete and finite Heisenberg group. We focus in\nparticular in the $PSL_2(p)$ groups which contain the phenomenologically\ninteresting cases.\n", "  We construct a new model of four-dimensional relativistic strings with\nintegrable dynamics on the worldsheet. In addition to translational modes this\nmodel contains a single massless pseudoscalar worldsheet field - the worldsheet\naxion. The axion couples to a topological density which counts the\nself-intersection number of a string. The corresponding coupling is fixed by\nintegrability to $Q=\\sqrt{7\\over 16\\pi}\\approx 0.37$. We argue that this model\nis a member of a larger family of relativistic non-critical integrable string\nmodels. This family includes and extends conventional non-critical strings\ndescribed by the linear dilaton CFT. Intriguingly, recent lattice data in\n$SU(3)$ and $SU(5)$ gluodynamics reveals the presence of a massive pseudoscalar\naxion on the worldsheet of confining flux tubes. The value of the corresponding\ncoupling, as determined from the lattice data, is equal to\n$Q_L\\approx0.38\\pm0.04$.\n", "  We present simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations spanning 3-78 keV\nof the nearest radio galaxy, Centaurus A (Cen A). The accretion geometry around\nthe central engine in Cen A is still debated, and we investigate possible\nconfigurations using detailed X-ray spectral modeling. NuSTAR imaged the\ncentral region of Cen A with sub-arcminute resolution at X-ray energies above\n10 keV for the first time, but finds no evidence for an extended source or\nother off-nuclear point-sources. The XMM-Newton and NuSTAR spectra agree well\nand can be described with an absorbed power-law with a photon index {\\Gamma} =\n1.815 +/- 0.005 and a fluorescent Fe K{\\alpha} line in good agreement with\nliterature values. The spectrum does not require a high-energy exponential\nrollover, with a constraint of E_fold > 1 MeV. A thermal Comptonization\ncontinuum describes the data well, with parameters that agree with values\nmeasured by INTEGRAL, in particular an electron temperature kTe between\n~100-300 keV, seed photon input temperatures between 5-50 eV. We do not find\nevidence for reflection or a broad iron line and put stringent upper limits of\nR < 0.01 on the reflection fraction and accretion disk illumination. We use\narchival Chandra data to estimate the contribution from diffuse emission,\nextra-nuclear point-sources, and the outer X-ray jet to the observed NuSTAR and\nXMM-Newton X-ray spectra and find the contribution to be negligible. We discuss\ndifferent scenarios for the physical origin of the observed hard X-ray\nspectrum, and conclude that the inner disk is replaced by an\nadvection-dominated accretion flow or that the X-rays are dominated by\nsynchrotron self-Compton emission from the inner regions of the radio jet or a\ncombination thereof.\n", "  Superhydrophobic surfaces with the self-cleaning behavior of lotus leaves are\nsought for drag reduction and phase change heat transfer applications. These\nsuperrepellent surfaces have traditionally been fabricated by random or\ndeterministic texturing of a hydrophobic material. Recently, superrepellent\nsurfaces have also been made from hydrophilic materials, by deterministic\ntexturing using photolithography, without low-surface energy coating. Here, we\nshow that hydrophilic materials can also be made superrepellent to water by\nchemical texturing, a stochastic rather than deterministic process. These\nmetallic surfaces are the first analog of lotus leaves, in terms of\nwettability, texture and repellency. A mechanistic model is also proposed to\ndescribe the influence of multiple tiers of roughness on wettability and\nrepellency. This demonstrated ability to make hydrophilic materials\nsuperrepellent without deterministic structuring or additional coatings opens\nthe way to large scale and robust manufacturing of superrepellent surfaces.\n", "  We have performed fits of the pseudoscalar masses and decay constants, from a\nvariety of RBC-UKQCD domain wall fermion ensembles, to $SU(2)$ partially\nquenched chiral perturbation theory at next-to leading order (NLO) and\nnext-to-next-to leading order (NNLO). We report values for 9 NLO and 8 linearly\nindependent combinations of NNLO partially quenched low energy constants, which\nwe compare to other lattice and phenomenological determinations. We discuss the\nsize of successive terms in the chiral expansion and use our large set of low\nenergy constants to make predictions for mass splittings due to QCD isospin\nbreaking effects and the S-wave $\\pi \\pi$ scattering lengths. We conclude that,\nfor the range of pseudoscalar masses explored in this work, $115~\\mathrm{MeV}\n\\lesssim m_{\\rm PS} \\lesssim 430~\\mathrm{MeV}$, the NNLO $SU(2)$ expansion is\nquite robust and can fit lattice data with percent-scale accuracy.\n", "  In the framework of Husimi and Bethe lattices, we investigate a generalized\npolymer model that incorporates as special cases different models previously\nstudied in the literature, namely, the standard interacting self-avoiding walk,\nthe interacting self-avoiding trail, and the vertex-interacting self-avoiding\nwalk. These models are characterized by different microscopic interactions,\ngiving rise, in the two-dimensional case, to collapse transitions of an\napparently different nature. We expect that our results, even though of a\nmean-field type, could provide some useful information to elucidate the role of\nsuch different theta points in the polymer phase diagram. These issues are at\nthe core of a long-standing unresolved debate.\n", "  Collisionless shocks are efficient particle accelerators. At Earth, ions with\nenergies exceeding 100 keV are seen upstream of the bow shock when the magnetic\ngeometry is quasi-parallel, and large-scale supernova remnant shocks can\naccelerate ions into cosmic rays energies. This energization is attributed to\ndiffusive shock acceleration, however, for this process to become active the\nions must first be sufficiently energized. How and where this initial\nacceleration takes place has been one of the key unresolved issues in shock\nacceleration theory. Using Cluster spacecraft observations, we study the\nsignatures of ion reflection events in the turbulent transition layer upstream\nof the terrestrial bow shock, and with the support of a hybrid simulation of\nthe shock, we show that these reflection signatures are characteristic of the\nfirst step in the ion injection process. These reflection events develop in\nparticular in the region where the trailing edge of large-amplitude upstream\nwaves intercept the local shock ramp and the upstream magnetic field changes\nfrom quasi-perpendicular to quasi-parallel. The dispersed ion velocity\nsignature observed can be attributed to a rapid succession of ion reflections\nat this wave boundary. After the ions' initial interaction with the shock, they\nflow upstream along the quasi-parallel magnetic field. Each subsequent wave\nfront in the upstream region will sweep the ions back toward the shock, where\nthey gain energy with each transition between the upstream and the shock wave\nframes. Within three to five gyroperiods, some ions have gained enough parallel\nvelocity to escape upstream, thus completing the injection process.\n", "  We present a new ternary free energy lattice Boltzmann model. The\ndistinguishing feature of our model is that we are able to analytically derive\nand independently vary all fluid-fluid surface tensions and the solid surface\ncontact angles. We carry out a number of benchmark tests: (i) double emulsions\nand liquid lenses to validate the surface tensions, (ii) ternary fluids in\ncontact with a square well to compare the contact angles against analytical\npredictions, and (iii) ternary phase separation to verify that the\nmulticomponent fluid dynamics is accurately captured. Additionally we also\ndescribe how the model here presented here can be extended to include an\narbitrary number of fluid components.\n", "  In this paper, we present the experimental generation of Airy beams via\ncomputational and photorefractive holography. Experimental generation of Airy\nbeams using conventional optical components presents several difficulties and\nare practically infeasible. Thus, the optical generation of Airy beams has been\nmade from the optical reconstruction of a computer generated hologram\nimplemented in a spatial light modulators. In the photorefractive holography\ntechnique, being used for the first time to our knowledge, the hologram of an\nAiry beam is constructed (recorded) and reconstructed (reading) optically in a\nnonlinear photorefractive medium. The Airy beam experimental realization was\nmade by a setup of computational and photorefractive holography using a\nphotorefractive Bi_{12}TiO_{20} crystal as holographic recording medium. Airy\nbeams and Airy beam arrays were obtained experimentally as in accordance with\nthe predicted theory; and present excellent prospects for applications in\noptical trapping and optical communications systems.\n", "  Notable recent works have focused on the multi-layer properties of coevolving\ndiseases. We point out that very similar systems play an important role in\npopulation ecology. Specifically we study a meta food-web model that was\nrecently proposed by Pillai et al. This model describes a network of species\nconnected by feeding interactions, which spread over a network of spatial\npatches. Focusing on the essential case, where the network of feeding\ninteractions is a chain, we develop an analytical approach for the computation\nof the degree distributions of colonized spatial patches for the different\nspecies in the chain. This framework allows us to address ecologically relevant\nquestions. Considering configuration model ensembles of spatial networks, we\nfind that there is an upper bound for the fraction of patches that a given\nspecies can occupy, which depends only on the networks mean degree. For a given\nmean degree there is then an optimal degree distribution that comes closest to\nthe upper bound. Notably scale-free degree distributions perform worse than\nmore homogeneous degree distributions if the mean degree is sufficiently high.\nBecause species experience the underlying network differently the optimal\ndegree distribution for one particular species is generally not the optimal\ndistribution for the other species in the same food web. These results are of\ninterest for conservation ecology, where, for instance, the task of selecting\nareas of old-growth forest to preserve in an agricultural landscape, amounts to\nthe design of a patch network.\n", "  The domain wall motion along a helix-shaped nanowire is studied for the case\nof spin-current driving via Bazaliy-Zhang-Li mechanism. The analysis is based\non collective variable approach. Two new effects are ascertained: (i) the\ncurvature results in appearance of the Walker limit for a uniaxial wire, (ii)\nthe torsion results in effective shift of the nonadiabatic spin torque\nparameter $\\beta$. The latter effect changes considerably the domain wall\nvelocity and can result in negative domain wall mobility. This effect can be\nalso used for an experimental determination of the nonadiabatic parameter\n$\\beta$ and damping coefficient $\\alpha$.\n", "  We introduce and analyze two different scenarios for violation of the\nWiedemann-Franz law in strongly correlated electron systems of solids, close to\na topological quantum critical point (TQCP) where the density of states $N(0)$\ndiverges. The first, applicable to the Fermi-liquid (FL) side of the TQCP,\ninvolves a transverse zero-sound collective mode that opens a new channel for\nthe thermal conductivity, thereby enhancing the Lorenz number $L(0)$ relative\nto the value $L_0=\\pi^2k^2_B/3e^2$ dictated by conventional FL theory. The\nsecond mechanism for violation of the WF law, relevant to the non-Fermi-liquid\n(NFL) side of the TQCP, involves the formation of a flat band and leads instead\nto a reduction of the Lorenz number.\n", "  The halo model is a theoretically and empirically well-motivated framework\nfor predicting the statistics of the nonlinear matter distribution in the\nUniverse. However, current incarnations of the halo model suffer from two major\ndeficiencies: $(i)$ they do not enforce the stress-energy conservation of\nmatter; $(ii)$ they are not guaranteed to recover exact perturbation theory\nresults on large scales. Here, we provide a formulation of the halo model\n(\"EHM\") that remedies both drawbacks in a consistent way, while attempting to\nmaintain the predictivity of the approach. In the formulation presented here,\nmass and momentum conservation are guaranteed on large scales, and results of\nperturbation theory and the effective field theory can in principle be matched\nto any desired order on large scales. We find that a key ingredient in the halo\nmodel power spectrum is the halo stochasticity covariance, which has been\nstudied to a much lesser extent than other ingredients such as mass function,\nbias, and profiles of halos. As written here, this approach still does not\ndescribe the transition regime between perturbation theory and halo scales\nrealistically, which is left as an open problem. We also show explicitly that,\nwhen implemented consistently, halo model predictions do not depend on any\nproperties of low-mass halos that are smaller than the scales of interest.\n", "  Spectral line widths are often observed to be larger than can be accounted\nfor by thermal and instrumental broadening alone. This excess broadening is a\nkey observational constraint for both nanoflare and wave dissipation models of\ncoronal heating. Here we present a survey of non-thermal velocities measured in\nthe high temperature loops (1--5MK) often found in the cores of solar active\nregions. This survey of $\\textit{Hinode}$ Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging\nSpectrometer (EIS) observations covers 15 non-flaring active regions that span\na wide range of solar conditions. We find relatively small non-thermal\nvelocities, with a mean value of 17km s$^{-1}$, and no significant trend with\ntemperature or active region magnetic flux. These measurements appear to be\ninconsistent with those expected from reconnection jets in the corona,\nchromospheric evaporation induced by coronal nanoflares, and Alfv\\'en wave\nturbulence models. Furthermore, because the observed non-thermal widths are\ngenerally small their measurements are difficult and susceptible to systematic\neffects.\n", "  Quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects are studied in a symmetric nonlinear\noptical coupler, which is composed of two nonlinear ($\\chi^{\\left(2\\right)}$)\nwaveguides that are interacting with each other via the evanescent waves. Both\nthe waveguides operate under second harmonic generation. However, to study\nquantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects one of them is considered as the system and\nthe other one is considered as the probe. Considering all the fields involved\nas weak, a completely quantum mechanical description is provided, and the\nanalytic solutions of Heisenberg's equations of motion for all the field modes\nare obtained using a perturbative technique. Photon number statistics of the\nsecond harmonic mode of the system is shown to depend on the presence of the\nprobe, and this dependence is considered as quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects.\nFurther, it is established that as a special case of the momentum operator for\n$\\chi^{\\left(2\\right)}-\\chi^{\\left(2\\right)}$ symmetric coupler we can obtain\nmomentum operator of $\\chi^{\\left(2\\right)}-\\chi^{\\left(1\\right)}$ asymmetric\ncoupler with linear ($\\chi^{\\left(1\\right)}$) waveguide as the probe, and in\nsuch a particular case, the expressions obtained for Zeno and anti-Zeno effects\nwith nonlinear probe (which we referred to as nonlinear quantum Zeno and\nanti-Zeno effects) may be reduced to the corresponding expressions with linear\nprobe (which we referred to as the linear quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects).\nLinear and nonlinear quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects are rigorously\ninvestigated, and it is established that in the stimulated case, we may switch\nbetween quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno effects just by controlling the phase of the\nsecond harmonic mode of the system or probe.\n", "  In this paper, we have carried out linear and nonlinear analysis of tearing\nand surface preserving modes of two dimensional (2D) Electron\nMagnetohydrodynamics (EMHD). A linear analysis shows that the perturbations\nparallel to equilibrium magnetic field $B_0$ (characteristic tangent hyperbolic\nspatial profile), driven by the current gradients, lead to two different modes.\nThe first mode is the tearing mode having a non-local behavior which requires\nthe null-line in the magnetic field profile. Whereas, the second mode is a\nsurface preserving local mode which does not require the null-line in the\nmagnetic field. The quantity $B_0 - B_0^{''}$ should change sign for these\nmodes to exist. In nonlinear simulations, for tearing case we observe formation\nof magnetic island at the null-line due to the reconnection of magnetic field\nlines. However, for surface preserving mode, a channel like structure is\nobserved instead of the island structure.\n", "  A sample of two proton and no pion events selected in the ArgoNeuT neutrino\nscattering experiment on liquid argon target [Phys. Rev. D90 (2014) 012008] is\nanalyzed with NuWro Monte Carlo event generator. An attempt is made to estimate\nhow likely it is to obtain observed numbers of laboratory frame and\nreconstructed back-to-back nucleon pairs. For laboratory frame back-to-back\nevents a clear data/MC discrepancy is seen. For the reconstructed nucleon pairs\na good agreement is reported. We provide a simple kinematical argument why this\naccordance is expected.\n", "  SO(10) grand unified theories can ensure the stability of new particles in\nterms of the gauge group structure itself, and in this respect are well suited\nto accommodate dark matter (DM) candidates in the form of new stable massive\nparticles. We introduce new fermions in two vector 10 representations. When\nSO(10) is broken to the standard model by a minimal 45 + 126 + 10 scalar sector\nwith $SU(3)_C \\otimes SU(2)_L \\otimes SU(2)_R\\otimes U(1)_{B-L}$ as\nintermediate symmetry group, the resulting lightest new states are two Dirac\nfermions corresponding to combinations of the neutral members of the $SU(2)_L$\ndoublets in the 10's, which get splitted in mass by loop corrections involving\n$W_R$. The resulting lighter mass eigenstate is stable, and has only\nnon-diagonal $Z_{L,R}$ neutral current couplings to the heavier neutral state.\nDirect detection searches are evaded if the mass splitting is sufficiently\nlarge to suppress kinematically inelastic light-to-heavy scatterings. By\nrequiring that this condition is satisfied, we obtain the upper limit $M_{W_R}\n\\lesssim 25$ TeV.\n", "  We investigate a method to assess the validity of gravitational-wave detector\ncalibration through the use of gamma-ray bursts as standard sirens. Such\nsignals, as measured via gravitational-wave observations, provide an estimated\nluminosity distance that is subject to uncertainties in the calibration of the\ndata. If a host galaxy is identified for a given source then its redshift can\nbe combined with current knowledge of the cosmological parameters yielding the\ntrue luminosity distance. This will then allow a direct comparison with the\nestimated value and can validate the accuracy of the original calibration. We\nuse simulations of individual detectable gravitational-wave signals from binary\nneutron star (BNS) or neutron star-black hole systems, which we assume to be\nfound in coincidence with short gamma-ray bursts, to estimate any discrepancy\nin the overall scaling of the calibration for detectors in the Advanced LIGO\nand Advanced Virgo network. We find that the amplitude scaling of the\ncalibration for the LIGO instruments could on average be confirmed to within\n$\\sim 10\\%$ for a BNS source within 100 Mpc. This result is largely independent\nof the current detector calibration method and gives an uncertainty that is\ncompetitive with that expected in the current calibration procedure.\nConfirmation of the calibration accuracy to within $\\sim 20\\%$ can be found\nwith BNS sources out to $\\sim 500$ Mpc.\n", "  The fate of shift-symmetries in effective string models is considered beyond\ntree-level. Such symmetries have been proposed in the past as a way to maintain\na hierarchically small Higgs mass and also play a role in schemes of\ncosmological relaxation. It is argued that on general grounds one expects\nshift-symmetries to be restored in the limit of certain asymmetric\ncompactifications, to all orders in perturbation theory. This behaviour is\nverified by explicit computation of the Kaehler potential to one-loop order.\n", "  Graphene monolayer, with extremely low flexural stiffness, displays\nspontaneous rippling due to thermal fluctuations at a finite temperature. When\na graphene membrane is placed on a solid substrate, the adhesive interactions\nbetween graphene and the substrate could considerably suppress thermal\nrippling. On the other hand, the statistical nature of thermal rippling adds an\nentropic contribution to the graphene-substrate interactions. In this paper we\npresent a statistical mechanics analysis on thermal rippling of monolayer\ngraphene supported on a rigid substrate, assuming a generic form of van der\nWaals interactions between graphene and substrate at T = 0 K. The rippling\namplitude, the equilibrium average separation, and the average interaction\nenergy are predicted simultaneously and compared with molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations. While the amplitude of thermal rippling is reduced by adhesive\ninteractions, the entropic contribution leads to an effective repulsion. As a\nresult, the equilibrium average separation increases and the effective adhesion\nenergy decreases with increasing temperature. Moreover, the effect of a biaxial\npre-strain in graphene is considered, and a buckling instability is predicted\nat a critical compressive strain that depends on both the temperature and the\nadhesive interactions. Limited by the harmonic approximations, the theoretical\npredictions agree with MD simulations only for relatively small rippling\namplitudes but can be extended to account for the anharmonic effects.\n", "  Using high-pressure magnetotransport techniques we have discovered\nsuperconductivity in Bi2Te, a member of the infinitely adaptive (Bi2)m(Bi2Te3)n\nseries, whose end members, Bi and Bi2Te3, can be tuned to display topological\nsurface states or superconductivity. Bi2Te has a maximum Tc= 8.6 K at P= 14.5\nGPa and goes through multiple high pressure phase transitions, ultimately\ncollapsing into a bcc structure that suggests a universal behavior across the\nseries. High-pressure magnetoresistance and Hall measurements suggest a\nsemi-metal to metal transition near 5.4 GPa, which accompanies the hexagonal to\nintermediate phase transition seen via x-ray diffraction measurements. In\naddition, the linearity of Hc2(T) exceeds the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg\nlimit, even in the extreme spin-orbit scattering limit, yet is consistent with\nother strong spin-orbit materials. Considering these results in combination\nwith similar reports on strong spin-orbit scattering materials seen in the\nliterature, we suggest the need for a new theory that can address the\nunconventional nature of their superconducting states.\n", "  The dispersion of the volume relativistic magnetoplasma mode in a gated\nGaAs/AlGaAs quantum well is measured using a coupled resonators detection\ntechnique. The weakly damped relativistic mode exhibits an unusual\nzigzag-shaped magnetodispersion dependence dictated by the diagonal component\nof the resistivity tensor $\\rho_{xx}$. The plasma excitation easily hybridizes\nwith photon modes due to a large spatial delocalization of its electromagnetic\nfield. The effects of electron density and structure geometry on the excitation\nspectrum have been investigated.\n", "  We obtain a four-dimensional supergravity with spontaneously broken\nsupersymmetry allowing for de Sitter vacua by coupling a superspace action of\nminimal N=1, D=4 supergravity to a locally supersymmetric generalization of the\nVolkov-Akulov goldstino action describing the dynamics of a space-filling\nnon-BPS 3-brane in N=1, D=4 superspace. To the quadratic order in the goldstino\nfield the obtained action coincides with earlier constructions of\nsupergravities with nilpotent superfields, while matching the higher-order\ncontributions will require a non-linear redefinition of fields. In the unitary\ngauge, in which the goldstino field is set to zero, the action coincides with\nthat of Volkov and Soroka. We also show how a nilpotency constraint on a chiral\ncurvature superfield emerges in this formulation.\n", "  The finite volume problem of O(2N) sigma models with integrable diagonal\nboundaries on a finite interval is investigated. The double row transfer matrix\nis diagonalized by Algebraic Bethe Ansatz. The boundary Bethe Yang equations\nfor the particle rapidities and the accompanying Bethe Ansatz equations are\nderived.\n", "  We discuss structure and geometrical characteristics of coherent vortices\nappearing as a result of the inverse cascade in the two-dimensional turbulence\nin a finite box. We demonstrate that the universal velocity profile,\nestablished previously, corresponds to the passive regime of flow fluctuations.\nWe find the vortex core radius and the vortex size and argue that an amount of\nthe vortices generated in the box depends on the system parameters.\n", "  We study the behavior of two dimensional supersymmetric connections of $n$\ncopies of $O(N)$ models with an $\\mathcal{N} = (0,1)$ heterotic deformation\ngenerated by a right moving fermion. We develop the model in analogy with the\nconnected $\\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ $CP(N-1)$ models for the case of a single\nconnecting fermionic superfield. We calculate the effective potential in the\nlarge $N$ limit and determine the vacuum field configurations. Similarily to\nother SUSY connected models we find that SUSY is unbroken under certain\nconditions despite the vanishing of the Witten index. Specifically, this\npreservation of SUSY occurs when we have an even number $n$ of $O(N)$ families.\nAs in previous cases we show that this result follows from a $Z_n$ symmetry\nunder a particular exchange of the $O(N)$ families. This leads to a definition\nof a modified Witten index, which gaurantees the preservation of SUSY in this\ncase.\n", "  An investigation on the mechanism of relaxation of axially confined 400 GeV/c\nprotons to planar channeling in a bent crystal was carried out at the extracted\nline H8 from CERN Super Proton Synchrotron. The experimental results were\ncritically compared to computer simulations, showing a good agreement. We\nfirmly individuated a necessary condition for the exploitation of axial\nconfinement or its relaxation for particle beam manipulation in high-energy\naccelerators. We demonstrated that with a short bent crystal, aligned with one\nof its main axis to the beam direction, it is possible to realize either a\ntotal beam steerer or a beam splitter with adjustable intensity. In particular,\nin the latter case, a complete relaxation from axial confinement to planar\nchanneling takes place, resulting in beam splitting into the two strongest skew\nplanar channels.\n", "  We show that the two-point function of a quantum field theory with de Sitter\nmomentum space (herein called DSR) can be expressed as the product of a\nstandard delta function and an energy-dependent factor. This is a highly\nnon-trivial technical result in any theory without a preferred frame. Applied\nto models exhibiting running of the dimensionality of space, this result is\nessential in proving that vacuum fluctuations are generally scale-invariant at\nhigh energies whenever there is running to two dimensions. This is equally true\nfor theories with and without a preferred frame, with differences arising only\nas we consider higher order correlators. Specifically, the three-point function\nof DSR has a unique structure of \"open triangles\", as shown here.\n", "  We will review the main aspects of a mechanism for the contemporary\ngeneration of the baryon and Dark Matter abundances from the out-of-equilibrium\ndecay of a Wimp-like mother particle and briefly discuss a concrete realization\nin a Supersymmetric scenario.\n", "  In this work we present the effective field theory of primordial statistical\nanisotropies generated during anisotropic inflation involving a background\n$U(1)$ gauge field. Besides the usual Goldstone boson associated with the\nbreaking of time diffeomorphism we have two additional Goldstone bosons\nassociated with the breaking of spatial diffeomorphisms. We further identify\nthese two new Goldstone bosons with the expected two transverse degrees of the\n$U(1)$ gauge field fluctuations. Upon defining the appropriate unitary gauge,\nwe present the most general quadratic action which respects the remnant\nsymmetry in the unitary gauge. The interactions between various Goldstone\nbosons leads to statistical anisotropy in curvature perturbation power\nspectrum. Calculating the general results for power spectrum anisotropy, we\nrecover the previously known results in specific models of anisotropic\ninflation. In addition, we present novel results for statistical anisotropy in\nmodels with non-trivial sound speed for inflaton fluctuations. Also we identify\nthe interaction which leads to birefringence-like effects in anisotropic power\nspectrum in which the speed of gauge field fluctuations depends on the\ndirection of the mode propagation and the two polarization of gauge field\nfluctuations contribute differently in statistical anisotropy. As another\ninteresting application, our EFT approach naturally captures interactions\ngenerating parity violating statistical anisotropies.\n", "  Phonon boundary scattering is typically treated using the Fuchs-Sondheimer\ntheory, which assumes that phonons are thermalized to the local temperature at\nthe boundary. However, whether such a thermalization process actually occurs\nand its effect on thermal transport remains unclear. Here we examine thermal\ntransport along thin films with both thermalizing and non-thermalizing walls by\nsolving the spectral Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) for steady state and\ntransient transport. We find that in steady state, the thermal transport is\ngoverned by the Fuchs-Sondheimer theory and is insensitive to whether the\nboundaries are thermalizing or not. In contrast, under transient conditions,\nthe thermal decay rates are significantly different for thermalizing and\nnon-thermalizing walls. We also show that, for transient transport, the\nthermalizing boundary condition is unphysical due to violation of heat flux\nconservation at the boundaries. Our results provide insights into the boundary\nscattering process of thermal phonons over a range of heating length scales\nthat are useful for interpreting thermal measurements on nanostructures.\n", "  We build an effective medium theory for two-dimensional photonic crystals\ncomprising a rectangular lattice of dielectric cylinders with the incident\nelectric field polarized along the axis of the cylinders. In particular, we\ndiscuss the feasibility of constructing an effective medium theory for the case\nwhere the Bloch wave vector is far away from the center of Brillouin zone,\nwhere the optical response of the photonic crystal is necessarily anisotropic\nand hence the effective medium description becomes inevitability angle\ndependent. We employ the scattering theory and treat the two-dimensional system\nas a stack of one-dimensional arrays. We consider only the zero-order\ninterlayer diffraction and all the higher order diffraction terms of interlayer\nscattering are ignored. This approximation works well when the higher order\ndiffraction terms are all evanescent waves and the interlayer distance is far\nenough for them to decay out. Scattering theory enables the calculation of\ntransmission and reflection coefficients of a finite sized slab, and we extract\nthe effective parameters such as the impedance ($Z_e$) and the refractive index\n($n_e$) using a parameter retrieval method. We note that $n_e$ is uniquely\ndefined only in a very limited region of the reciprocal space. ($n_e k_0 a<<1$,\nwhere $k_0$ is the wave vector inside the vacuum and a is thickness of the slab\nfor retrieval), but $Z_e$ is uniquely defined and has a well-defined meaning\ninside a much larger domain in the reciprocal space. For a lossless system, the\neffective impedance $Z_e$ is purely real for the pass band and purely imaginary\nin the band gaps. Using the sign of the imaginary part of $Z_e$, we can\nclassify the band gaps into two groups and this classification explains why\nthere is usually no surface state on the boundary of typical fully gapped\nphotonic crystals comprising of a lattice of dielectric cylinders.\n", "  We demonstrate the controlled preparation of heteroepitaxial diamond nano-\nand microstructures on silicon wafer based iridium films as hosts for single\ncolor centers. Our approach uses electron beam lithography followed by reactive\nion etching to pattern the carbon layer formed by bias enhanced nucleation on\nthe iridium surface. In the subsequent chemical vapor deposition process, the\npatterned areas evolve into regular arrays of (001) oriented diamond\nnano-islands with diameters of <500nm and a height of approx. 60 nm. In the\nislands, we identify single SiV color centers with narrow zero phonon lines\ndown to 1 nm at room temperature.\n", "  We solved the Schr\\\"odinger problem for electrons in graphene subjected to\nboth a stationary magnetic field and a strong high-frequency electromagnetic\nwave (dressing field). The found solutions of the problem are used to describe\nthe magnetoelectronic properties of dressed graphene. It follows from the\npresent analysis that both optical characteristics and electronic transport are\nvery sensitive to the dressing field. Particularly, the field strongly changes\nthe spectra of optical absorption and the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations. As a\nresult, the developed theory opens a way for controlling magnetoelectronic\nproperties of graphene with light.\n", "  A theoretical study on the equation of state and the critical point behavior\nof hard-core double-Yukawa fluids is presented. Thermodynamic perturbation\ntheory, restricted to first order in the inverse temperature and having the\nhard-sphere fluid as the reference system, is used to derive a relatively\nsimple analytical equation of state of hard-core multi-Yukawa fluids. Using\nsuch an equation of state, the compressibility factor and phase behavior of six\nrepresentative hard-core double-Yukawa fluids is examined and compared with\navailable simulation results. The effect of varying the parameters of the\nhard-core double-Yukawa intermolecular potential on the location of the\ncritical point is also analyzed using different perspectives. The relevance of\nthis analysis for fluids whose molecules interact with realistic potentials is\nalso pointed out.\n", "  LUX is a two-phase (liquid/gas) xenon time projection chamber designed to\ndetect nuclear recoils resulting from interactions with dark matter particles.\nSignals from the detector are processed with an FPGA-based digital trigger\nsystem that analyzes the incoming data in real-time, with just a few\nmicrosecond latency. The system enables first pass selection of events of\ninterest based on their pulse shape characteristics and 3D localization of the\ninteractions. It has been shown to be >99% efficient in triggering on S2\nsignals induced by only few extracted liquid electrons. It is continuously and\nreliably operating since its full underground deployment in early 2013. This\ndocument is an overview of the systems capabilities, its inner workings, and\nits performance.\n", "  We investigate polarization squeezing in squeezed coherent states with\nvarying coherent amplitudes. In contrast to the traditional characterization\nbased on the full Stokes parameters, we experimentally determine the Stokes\nvector of each excitation manifold separately. Only for states with a fixed\nphoton number do the methods coincide; when the photon number is indefinite,\nour approach gives a richer and deeper description. By capitalising on the\nproperties of the Husimi Q function, we map this notion onto the Poincare\nspace, providing a full account of the measured squeezing.\n", "  The statistics of velocities in the cellular automaton model of Nagel and\nSchreckenberg for traffic are studied. From numerical simulations, we obtain\nthe probability distribution function (PDF) for vehicle velocities and the\nvelocity-velocity (vv) correlation function. We identify the probability to\nfind a standing vehicle as a potential order parameter that signals nicely the\ntransition between free congested flow for sufficiently large number of\nvelocity states. Our results for the vv correlation function resemble features\nof a second order phase transition. We develop a 3-body approximation that\nallows us to relate the PDFs for velocities and headways. Using this relation,\nan approximation to the velocity PDF is obtained from the headway PDF observed\nin simulations. We find a remarkable agreement between this approximation and\nthe velocity PDF obtained from simulations.\n", "  Using the construct of \"Verdier specialization\", we provide a purely\nmathematical derivation of Chern class identities which upon integration yield\nthe D3-brane tadpole relations coming from the equivalence between F-theory and\nassociated weakly coupled type IIB orientifold limits. In particular, we find\nthat all Chern class identities associated with weak coupling limits appearing\nin the physics literature are manifestations of a relative version of Verdier's\nspecialization formula.\n", "  In this paper, we study the rare radiative processes $B_c\\to D_{sJ}\n^{(*)}\\gamma$ within the Standard Model, where $D_{sJ}^{(*)}$ stands for the\nmeson $D_s^*$,~$D_{s1}(2460,2536)$ or ~$D_{s2}^*(2573)$. During the\ninvestigations, we consider the contributions from the penguin, annihilation,\ncolor-suppressed and color-favored cascade diagrams. Our results show that: 1)\nthe penguin and annihilation contributions are dominant in the branching\nfractions; 2) for the processes $B_c\\to D_s^{*}\\gamma$ and $B_c\\to\nD_{s1}(2460,2536)\\gamma$, the effects from the color-suppressed and\ncolor-favored cascade diagrams are un-negligible.\n", "  We evaluate string one-loop contributions to the Einstein-Hilbert term in\ntoroidal minimally supersymmetric type IIB orientifolds with D-branes. These\nhave potential applications to the determination of quantum corrections to the\nmoduli Kahler metric in these models.\n", "  We discuss a Coulomb gas realization of $n$-point correlation functions in\nthe $SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model that is suitable to\ncompute scattering amplitudes of winding strings in 3-dimensional Anti-de\nSitter space at tree-level and one-loop. This is a refined version of\npreviously proposed free-field realizations that, among other features,\naccomplishes to make the $H_3^+$ WZW-Liouville correspondence manifest.\n", "  We study chaos and scrambling in unitary channels by considering their\nentanglement properties as states. Using out-of-time-order correlation\nfunctions to diagnose chaos, we characterize the ability of a channel to\nprocess quantum information. We show that the generic decay of such correlators\nimplies that any input subsystem must have near vanishing mutual information\nwith almost all partitions of the output. Additionally, we propose the\nnegativity of the tripartite information of the channel as a general diagnostic\nof scrambling. This measures the delocalization of information and is closely\nrelated to the decay of out-of-time-order correlators. We back up our results\nwith numerics in two non-integrable models and analytic results in a perfect\ntensor network model of chaotic time evolution. These results show that the\nbutterfly effect in quantum systems implies the information-theoretic\ndefinition of scrambling.\n", "  The interplay of quantum anomalies with magnetic field and vorticity results\nin a variety of novel non-dissipative transport phenomena in systems with\nchiral fermions, including the quark-gluon plasma. Among them is the Chiral\nMagnetic Effect (CME) -- the generation of electric current along an external\nmagnetic field induced by chirality imbalance. Because the chirality imbalance\nis related to the global topology of gauge fields, the CME current is\ntopologically protected and hence non-dissipative even in the presence of\nstrong interactions. As a result, the CME and related quantum phenomena affect\nthe hydrodynamical and transport behavior of strongly coupled quark-gluon\nplasma, and can be studied in relativistic heavy ion collisions where strong\nmagnetic fields are created by the colliding ions. Evidence for the CME and\nrelated phenomena has been reported by the STAR Collaboration at Relativistic\nHeavy Ion Collider at BNL, and by the ALICE Collaboration at the Large Hadron\nCollider at CERN. The goal of the present review is to provide an elementary\nintroduction into the physics of anomalous chiral effects, to describe the\ncurrent status of experimental studies in heavy ion physics, and to outline the\nfuture work, both in experiment and theory, needed to eliminate the existing\nuncertainties in the interpretation of the data.\n", "  For important classes of many-fermion problems, quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)\nmethods allow exact calculations of ground-state and finite-temperature\nproperties, without the sign problem. The list spans condensed matter, nuclear\nphysics, and high-energy physics, including the half-filled repulsive Hubbard\nmodel, the spin-balanced atomic Fermi gas, lattice QCD calculations at zero\ndensity with Wilson Fermions, and is growing rapidly as a number of problems\nhave been discovered recently to be free of the sign problem. In these\nsituations, QMC calculations are relied upon to provide definitive answers.\nTheir results are instrumental to our ability to understand and compute\nproperties in fundamental models important to multiple sub-areas in quantum\nphysics. It is shown, however, that the most commonly employed algorithms in\nsuch situations turn out to have an infinite variance problem. A diverging\nvariance causes the estimated Monte Carlo statistical error bar to be\nincorrect, which can render the results of the calculation unreliable or\nmeaningless. We discuss how to identify the infinite variance problem. An\napproach is then proposed to solve the problem. The solution does not require\nmajor modifications to standard algorithms, adding a ``bridge link\" to the\nimaginary-time path-integral. The general idea is applicable to a variety of\nsituations where the infinite variance problem may be present. Illustrative\nresults are presented for the ground state of the Hubbard model at\nhalf-filling.\n", "  We study the persistent current in a ring consisting of N >> 1 Josephson\njunctions threaded by the magnetic flux. When the dynamics of the ring is\ndominated by the capacitances of the superconducting islands the system is\nequivalent to the xy spin system in 1+1 dimensions at the effective temperature\nT*=(2JU)^(1/2), with J being the Josephson energy of the junction and U being\nthe charging energy of the superconducting island. The numerical problem is\nchallenging due to the absence of thermodynamic limit and slow dynamics of the\nKosterlitz-Thouless transition. It is investigated on lattices containing up to\none million sites. At T << J the quantum phase slips are frozen. The low-T*\ndependence of the persistent current computed numerically agrees quantitatively\nwith the analytical formula provided by the spin-wave approximation. The high-\nT* behavior depends strongly on the magnetic flux and on the number of\nsuperconducting islands N. Depending on the flux, the persistent current gets\ndestroyed by the phase slips and/or by the superconductor-insulator transition\non increasing T*.\n", "  A 100um thick silicon detector with 1mm2 pad readout optimized for\nsub-nanosecond time resolution has been developed and tested. Coupled to a\npurposely developed amplifier based on SiGe HBT technology, this detector was\ncharacterized at the H8 beam line at the CERN SPS. An excellent time resolution\nof (106+-1)ps for silicon detectors was measured with minimum ionizing\nparticles.\n", "  We propose the study of unpolarized transverse momentum dependent gluon\nparton distributions as well as the effect of linearly polarized gluons on\ntransverse momentum and rapidity distributions of $J/\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon$\nproduction within the framework of transverse momentum dependent factorization\nemploying color evaporation model (CEM) in unpolarized proton-proton collision.\nWe estimate the transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of $J/\\psi$ and\n$\\Upsilon$ at LHCb, RHIC and AFTER energies using TMD evolution formalism.\n", "  Renormalization-group theory stands, since over 40 years, as one of the\npillars of modern physics. As such, there should be no remaining doubt\nregarding its validity. However, finite-size scaling, which derives from it,\nhas long been poorly understood above the upper critical dimension $d_c$ in\nmodels with free boundary conditions. Besides its fundamental significance for\nscaling theories, the issue is important at a practical level because\nfinite-size, statistical-physics systems, with free boundaries above $d_c$, are\nexperimentally accessible with long-range interactions. Here we address the\nroles played by Fourier modes for such systems and show that the current\nphenomenological picture is not supported for all thermodynamic observables\neither with free or periodic boundaries. Instead, the correct picture emerges\nfrom a sector of the renormalization group hitherto considered unphysical.\n", "  We present a route towards the quantum simulation of exotic quantum magnetism\nin ion traps by exploiting dual relations between different spin models. Our\nstrategy allows one to start from Hamiltonians that can be realized with\ncurrent technology, while properties of an exotic dual model are inferred from\nmeasurements of non-local, string-order-like, operators. The latter can be\nachieved from fluorescence, or from certain spectroscopic measurements, both of\nwhich can be combined with finite-size scaling by controlling the number of\nions in the dual quantum simulator. We apply this concept to propose quantum\nsimulators of frustrated quantum magnets, and Ising models with multi-spin\ninteractions. We test the validity of the idea by showing numerically that the\npredictions of an ideal dual quantum simulator are not qualitatively modified\nby relevant perturbations that occur naturally in the trapped-ion scenario.\n", "  We analyze the quantum supersymmetric cosmological FRW model with a scalar\nfield, with a conditional probability density and the scalar field identified\nas time. The Hilbert space has a spinorial structure and there is only one\nconsistent solution, with a conserved probability density. The dynamics of the\nscale factor is obtained from its mean value. The uncertainty relations are\nfulfilled and the corresponding fluctuations are consistent with a\nsemiclassical Universe. We give two examples which turn out to have negative\npotential.\n", "  Context: We introduce the Dwarf Galaxy Survey with Amateur Telescopes (DGSAT)\nproject and report the discovery of eleven low surface brightness (LSB)\ngalaxies in the fields of the nearby galaxies NGC 2683, NGC 3628, NGC 4594\n(M104), NGC 4631, NGC 5457 (M101), and NGC 7814. Aims: The DGSAT project aims\nto use the potential of small-sized telescopes to probe LSB features around\nlarge galaxies and to increase the sample size of the dwarf satellite galaxies\nin the Local Volume. Methods: Using long exposure images, fields of the target\nspiral galaxies are explored for extended low surface brightness objects. After\nidentifying dwarf galaxy candidates, their observed properties are extracted by\nfitting models to their light profiles. Results: We find three, one, three,\none, one, and two new LSB galaxies in the fields of NGC 2683, 3628, 4594, 4631,\n5457, and 7814, respectively. In addition to the newly found galaxies, we\nanalyse the structural properties of nine already known galaxies. All of these\n20 dwarf galaxy candidates have effective surface brightnesses in the range\n$25.3\\lesssim\\mu_{e}\\lesssim28.8$ mag.arcsec$^{-2}$ and are fit with Sersic\nprofiles with indices $n\\lesssim 1$. Assuming that they are in the vicinity of\nthe above mentioned massive galaxies, their $r$-band absolute magnitudes, their\neffective radii, and their luminosities are in the ranges $-15.6 \\lesssim M_r\n\\lesssim -7.8$, 160 pc $\\lesssim R_e \\lesssim$ 4.1 kpc, and $0.1\\times 10^6\n\\lesssim\\left(\\frac{L}{L_{\\odot}}\\right)_r\\lesssim127 \\times 10^6$,\nrespectively. To determine whether these LSB galaxies are indeed satellites of\nthe above mentioned massive galaxies, their distances need to be determined via\nfurther observations. Conclusions: Using small telescopes, we are readily able\nto detect LSB galaxies with similar properties to the known dwarf galaxies of\nthe Local Group.\n", "  An apparatus and a method are described for plasma etching of the inner\nsurface of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities. Accelerator SRF\ncavities are formed into a variable-diameter cylindrical structure made of bulk\nniobium, for resonant generation of the particle accelerating field. The etch\nrate non-uniformity due to depletion of the radicals has been overcome by the\nsimultaneous movement of the gas flow inlet and the inner electrode. An\neffective shape of the inner electrode to reduce the plasma asymmetry for the\ncoaxial cylindrical rf plasma reactor is determined and implemented in the\ncavity processing method. The processing was accomplished by moving axially the\ninner electrode and the gas flow inlet in a step-wise way to establish\nsegmented plasma columns. The test structure was a pillbox cavity made of steel\nof similar dimension to the standard SRF cavity. This was adopted to\nexperimentally verify the plasma surface reaction on cylindrical structures\nwith variable diameter using the segmented plasma generation approach. The pill\nbox cavity is filled with niobium ring- and disk-type samples and the etch rate\nof these samples was measured.\n", "  We study the possibility that self-interacting bosonic dark matter forms\nstar-like objects. We study both the case of attractive and repulsive\nself-interactions, and we focus particularly in the parameter phase space where\nself-interactions can solve well standing problems of the collisionless dark\nmatter paradigm. We find the mass radius relations for these dark matter\nbosonic stars, their density profile as well as the maximum mass they can\nsupport.\n", "  The LUX dark matter search experiment is a 350 kg dual-phase xenon time\nprojection chamber located at the 4850 ft level of the Sanford Underground\nResearch Facility in Lead, SD. The success of two-phase xenon detectors for\ndark matter searches relies on their ability to distinguish electron recoil\n(ER) background events from nuclear recoil (NR) signal events. Typically, the\nNR-ER discrimination is obtained from the ratio of the electroluminescence\nlight (S2) to the prompt scintillation light (S1). Analysis of the S1 pulse\nshape is an additional discrimination technique that can be used to distinguish\nNR from ER. Pulse-shape NR-ER discrimination can be achieved based on the ratio\nof the de-excitation processes from singlet and triplet states that generate\nthe S1. The NR S1 is dominated by the de-excitation process from singlet states\nwith a time constant of about 3 ns while the ER S1 is dominated by the\nde-excitation process from triplet states with a time constant of about 24 ns.\nAs the size of the detectors increases, the variation in the S1 photon flight\npath can become comparable to these decay constants, reducing the utility of\npulse-shape analysis to separate NR from ER. The effect of path length\nvariations in the LUX detector has been studied using the results of\nsimulations and the impact on the S1 pulse shape analysis is discussed.\n", "  We analytically compute, through the six-and-a-half post-Newtonian order, the\nsecond-order-in-eccentricity piece of the Detweiler-Barack-Sago gauge-invariant\nredshift function for a small mass in eccentric orbit around a Schwarzschild\nblack hole. Using the first law of mechanics for eccentric orbits [A. Le Tiec,\nPhys. Rev. D {\\bf 92}, 084021 (2015)] we transcribe our result into a\ncorrespondingly accurate knowledge of the second radial potential of the\neffective-one-body formalism [A. Buonanno and T. Damour, Phys. Rev. D {\\bf 59},\n084006 (1999)]. We compare our newly acquired analytical information to several\ndifferent numerical self-force data and find good agreement, within estimated\nerror bars. We also obtain, for the first time, independent analytical checks\nof the recently derived, comparable-mass fourth-post-Newtonian order dynamics\n[T. Damour, P. Jaranowski and G. Shaefer, Phys. Rev. D {\\bf 89}, 064058\n(2014)].\n", "  Here we introduce the Network Geometry with Flavor $s=-1,0,1$ (NGF)\ndescribing simplicial complexes defined in arbitrary dimension $d$ and evolving\nby a non-equilibrium dynamics. The NGF can generate discrete geometries of\ndifferent nature, ranging from chains and higher dimensional manifolds to\nscale-free networks with small-world properties, scale-free degree distribution\nand non-trivial community structure. The NGF admits as limiting cases both the\nBianconi-Barab\\'asi model for complex networks the stochastic Apollonian\nnetwork, and the recently introduced model for Complex Quantum Network\nManifolds. The thermodynamic properties of NGF reveal that NGF obeys a\ngeneralized area law opening a new scenario for formulating its coarse-grained\nlimit. The structure of NGF is strongly dependent on the dimensionality $d$. We\nalso show that NGF admits a quantum mechanical description in terms of\nassociated quantum network states. Quantum network states are evolving by a\nMarkovian dynamics and a quantum network state at time $t$ encodes all possible\nNGF evolutions up to time $t$. Interestingly the NGF remains fully classical\nbut its statistical properties reveal the relation to its quantum mechanical\ndescription. In fact the $\\delta$-dimensional faces of the NGF have generalized\ndegrees that follow either the Fermi-Dirac, Boltzmann or Bose-Einstein\nstatistics depending on the flavor $s$ and the dimensions $d$ and $\\delta$.\n", "  We investigate the special case of quintic interactions for massless higher\nspin gauge fields using the string-theoretic vertex operator construction for\nhigher spin gauge fields in Vasiliev's frame-like formalism. We compute\nexplicitly the related 5-point interaction vertex in the low energy limit of\nstring theory and find that: the structure of the quintic $s_1-s_2-s_3-s_4-s_5$\nhigher spin interaction gets drastically simplified and localized if a) the\nspin values satisfy the constraint $s_1+s_2+s_3=s_4+s_5+2$ (and, more\ngenerally, if the sum of three spin values roughly equals the sum of the\nremaining two b) One of the spin values, $s_4$ or $s_5$ is sufficiently small.\nIn this paper, the explicit computation is done for the case $s_4=4$\n", "  The paper revisits recent counterintuitive results on divergence of heat\nconduction coefficient in two-dimensional lattices. It was reported that in\ncertain lattices with on-site potential, for which one-dimensional chain has\nconvergent conductivity, for the 2D case it turns out to diverge. We\ndemonstrate that this conclusion is an artifact caused by insufficient size of\nthe simulated system. To overcome computational restrictions, a ribbon of\nrelatively small width is simulated instead of the square specimen. It is\nfurther demonstrated that the heat conduction coefficient in the \"long\"\ndirection of the ribbon ceases to depend on the width, as the latter achieves\nonly 10 to 20 interparticle distances. So, one can consider the dynamics of\nmuch longer systems, than in the traditional setting, and still can gain a\nreliable information regarding the 2D lattice. It turns out that for all\nconsidered models, for which the conductivity is convergent in the 1D case, it\nis indeed convergent in the 2D case. In the same time, however, the length of\nthe system, necessary to reveal the convergence in the 2D case, may be much\nbigger than in its 1D counterpart.\n", "  We present a phenomenological theory describing the finite-size\nevaporation-condensation transition of the $q$-state Potts model in the\nmicrocanonical ensemble. Our arguments rely on the existence of an exponent\n$\\sigma$, relating the surface and the volume of the condensed phase droplet.\nThe evaporation-condensation transition temperature and energy converge to\ntheir infinite-size values with the same power, $a=(1-\\sigma)/(2-\\sigma)$, of\nthe inverse of the system size. For the 2D Potts model we show, by means of\nefficient simulations up to $q=24$ and $1024^2$ sites, that the exponent $a$ is\ncompatible with $1/4$, in disagreement with previous studies. While this value\ncannot be addressed by the evaporation-condensation theory developed for the\nIsing model, it is obtained in the present scheme if $\\sigma=2/3$, in agreement\nwith previous theoretical guesses. The connection with the phenomenon of\nmetastability in the canonical ensemble is also discussed.\n", "  Recent experiments have shown that magnetic skyrmion bubbles can be generated\nand injected at room temperature in thin films [W. Jiang et al, Science vol.\n349, 283 (2015)]. Here, we demonstrate, using micromagnetic modeling, that such\nskyrmions can be generated by an inhomogeneous spin Hall torque in the presence\nof Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMIs). In the experimental\nTa/Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$ thin films, the DMI is rather small;\nnevertheless, the skyrmion bubbles are stable, or at least metastable on\nobservational time scales.\n", "  The plasmonic chirality has drawn a lot of attention because of the tunable\ncircular dichroism (CD) and the enhancement for the signal of chiral molecules.\nDifferent mechanisms have been proposed for explaining the plasmonic CD,\nhowever, a quantitative one like ab initio mechanism in chiral molecules is\nstill unavailable. In this work, a mechanism similar to the chiral molecules is\nanalyzed. The giant extrinsic circular dichroism of plasmonic splitting\nrectangle ring is quantitatively investigated theoretically. The interplay of\nelectric and magnetic modes of the meta-structure is proposed to explain the\ngiant CD. The interplay is analyzed both in an analytical coupled\nelectric-magnetic dipoles model and finite element method model. The surface\ncharge distributions show that the circular current yielded in the splitting\nrectangle ring makes it behave like a magneton at some resonant modes, which\ninteract with electric modes and results in a mixing of the two kinds of modes.\nThe strong interplay of the two kinds of modes is mainly responsible for the\ngiant CD.The analysis of the chiral near field of the structure shows potential\napplications in chiral molecule sensing.\n", "  Partial nesting between two connected or disconnected regions of the Fermi\nsurface leads to fractional powers of the Coulomb scattering lifetime as a\nfunction of temperature and frequency. This result is first demonstrated for a\ntoy band structure where partial nesting occurs within a single band and\nbetween different regions of the Brillouin zone. A comparison is then made to a\nmultiband scenario by studying the scattering rate of an effective two orbital\nmodel that was proposed in the context of multi-orbital superconductors. In the\nprocess, various model independent factors affecting the temperature exponent,\nn, are identified. The logarithmically divergent contributions of the lowest\norder vertex correction to the multi-orbital susceptibility, and the role\nplayed by nesting in suppressing these divergences is analyzed. The relevance\nof these results is discussed keeping the recently observed anomalous\nresistivity in the Co doped Iron superconductor LiFeAs as a backdrop.\n", "  The interfacial free energy is a central quantity in crystallization from the\nmeta-stable melt. In suspensions of charged colloidal spheres, nucleation and\ngrowth kinetics can be accurately measured from optical experiments. In\nprevious work, from this data effective non-equilibrium values for the\ninterfacial free energy between the emerging bcc-nuclei and the adjacent melt\nin dependence on the chemical potential difference between melt phase and\ncrystal phase were derived using classical nucleation theory. A strictly linear\nincrease of the interfacial free energy was observed as a function of increased\nmeta-stability. Here, we further analyze this data for five aqueous suspensions\nof charged spheres and one binary mixture. We utilize a simple extrapolation\nscheme and interpret our findings in view of Turnbull's empirical rule. Our\nfirst estimates for the reduced interfacial free energy, $\\sigma_{0,bcc}$,\nbetween coexisting equilibrium uid and bcc-crystal phases are on the order of a\nfew $k_BT$. Their values are not correlated to any of the electrostatic\ninteraction parameters but rather show a systematic decrease with increasing\nsize polydispersity and a lower value for the mixture as compared to the pure\ncomponents. At the same time, $\\sigma_0$ also shows an approximately linear\ncorrelation to the entropy of freezing. The equilibrium interfacial free energy\nof strictly monodisperse charged spheres may therefore be still greater.\n", "  In many biological processes highly charged biomolecules are adsorbed into\noppositely charged surfaces of macroions and membranes. They form strongly\ncorrelated structures close to the surface which can not be explained by the\nconventional Poisson-Boltzmann theory. Many of the flexible biomolecules can be\ndescribed by Gaussian polymers. In this work strong coupling theory is used to\nstudy the adsorption of highly charged Gaussian polyelectrolytes. Two cases of\nadsorptions are considered, when the Gaussian polyelectrolytes are confined a)\nby one charged wall, and b) between two charged walls. The effects of salt and\nthe geometry of the polymers on their adsorption- depletion transitions in the\nstrong coupling regime are discussed.\n", "  We theoretically propose a scheme for the generation of a non-classical\nsingle-mode motional state of a mechanical resonator (MR) in the three-mode\noptomechanical systems, in which two optical modes of the cavities are linearly\ncoupled to each other and one mechanical mode of the MR is optomechanically\ncoupled to the two optical modes with the same coupling strength\nsimultaneously. One cavity is driven by a coherent laser light. By properly\ntuning the frequency of the weak driving field, we obtain engineered\nLiouvillian superoperator via engineering the selective interaction Hamiltonian\nconfined to the Fock subspaces. In this case, the motional state of the MR can\nbe prepared into a non-Gaussian state, which possesses the sub-Poisson\nstatistics although its Wigner function is positive.\n", "  We discuss the near BPS expansion of the generalized cusp anomalous dimension\nwith L units of R-charge. Integrability provides an exact solution, obtained by\nsolving a general TBA equation in the appropriate limit: we propose here an\nalternative method based on supersymmetric localization. The basic idea is to\nrelate the computation to the vacuum expectation value of certain 1/8 BPS\nWilson loops with local operator insertions along the contour. These\nobservables localize on a two-dimensional gauge theory on S^2, opening the\npossibility of exact calculations. As a test of our proposal, we reproduce the\nleading Luscher correction at weak coupling to the generalized cusp anomalous\ndimension. This result is also checked against a genuine Feynman diagram\napproach in N=4 Super Yang-Mills theory.\n", "  In the case of three quark flavors, (pseudo)scalar diquarks transform as\nantiquarks under chiral transformations. We construct four spin-1/2 baryonic\nmultiplets from left- and right-handed quarks as well as left- and right-handed\ndiquarks. The fact that two of these multiplets transform in a \"mirror\" way\nallows for chirally invariant mass terms. We then embed these baryonic\nmultiplets into the Lagrangian of the so-called extended Linear Sigma Model,\nwhich features (pseudo)scalar and (axial-)vector mesons, as well as glueballs.\nReducing the Lagrangian to the two-flavor case, we obtain four doublets of\nnucleonic states. These mix to produce four experimentally observed states with\ndefinite parity: the positive-parity nucleon $N(939)$ and Roper resonance\n$N(1440)$, as well as the negative-parity resonances $N(1535)$ and $N(1650)$.\nWe determine the parameters of the nucleonic part of the Lagrangian from a fit\nto masses and decay properties of the aforementioned states. Studying the limit\nof vanishing quark condensate, we conclude that $N(939)$ and $N(1535)$, as well\nas $N(1440)$ and $N(1650)$ form pairs of chiral partners.\n", "  We present new, tight, constraints on the cosmological background of\ngravitational waves (GWs) using the latest measurements of CMB temperature and\npolarization anisotropies provided by the Planck, BICEP2 and Keck Array\nexperiments. These constraints are further improved when the GW contribution\n$N^{\\rm GW}_{\\rm eff}$ to the effective number of relativistic degrees of\nfreedom $N_{\\rm eff}$ is also considered. Parametrizing the tensor spectrum as\na power law with tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, tilt $n_\\mathrm{t}$ and pivot\n$0.01\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and assuming a minimum value of $r=0.001$, we find\n$r < 0.089$, $n_\\mathrm{t} = 1.7^{+2.1}_{-2.0}$ ($95\\%\\,\\mathrm{CL}$, no\n$N^{\\rm GW}_{\\rm eff}$) and $r < 0.082$, $n_\\mathrm{t} = -0.05^{+0.58}_{-0.87}$\n($95\\%\\,\\mathrm{CL}$, with $N^{\\rm GW}_{\\rm eff}$). When the recently released\n$95\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$ data from Keck Array are added to the analysis, the\nconstraints on $r$ are improved to $r < 0.067$ ($95\\%\\,\\mathrm{CL}$, no $N^{\\rm\nGW}_{\\rm eff}$), $r < 0.061$ ($95\\%\\,\\mathrm{CL}$, with $N^{\\rm GW}_{\\rm\neff}$). We discuss the limits coming from direct detection experiments such as\nLIGO-Virgo, pulsar timing (European Pulsar Timing Array) and CMB spectral\ndistortions (FIRAS). Finally, we show future constraints achievable from a\nCOrE-like mission: if the tensor-to-scalar ratio is of order $10^{-2}$ and the\ninflationary consistency relation $n_\\mathrm{t} = -r/8$ holds, COrE will be\nable to constrain $n_\\mathrm{t}$ with an error of $0.16$ at\n$95\\%\\,\\mathrm{CL}$. In the case that lensing $B$-modes can be subtracted to\n$10\\%$ of their power, a feasible goal for COrE, these limits will be improved\nto $0.11$ at $95\\%\\,\\mathrm{CL}$.\n", "  Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs) are a population of hyper-luminous\ninfrared galaxies identified by the WISE mission from their very red mid-IR\ncolors, and characterized by hot dust temperatures ($T>60~\\rm K$). Several\nstudies have shown clear evidence that the IR emission in these objects is\npowered by a highly dust-obscured AGN that shows close to Compton-thick\nabsorption at X-ray wavelengths. Thanks to the high AGN obscuration, the host\ngalaxy is easily observable, and has UV/optical colors usually consistent with\nthose of a normal galaxy. Here we discuss a sub-population of 8 Hot DOGs that\nshow enhanced rest-frame UV/optical emission. We discuss three scenarios that\nmight explain the excess UV emission: (i) unobscured light leaked from the AGN\nby reflection over the dust or by partial coverage of the accretion disk; (ii)\na second unobscured AGN in the system; or (iii) a luminous young starburst.\nX-ray observations can help discriminate between these scenarios. We study in\ndetail the blue excess Hot DOG WISE J020446.13-050640.8, which was\nserendipitously observed by Chandra/ACIS-I for 174.5 ks. The X-ray spectrum is\nconsistent with a single, hyper-luminous, highly absorbed AGN, and is strongly\ninconsistent with the presence of a secondary unobscured AGN. Based on this, we\nargue that the excess blue emission in this object is most likely either due to\nreflection or a co-eval starburst. We favor the reflection scenario as the\nunobscured star-formation rate needed to power the UV/optical emission would be\n$\\gtrsim 1000~\\rm M_{\\odot}~\\rm yr^{-1}$. Deep polarimetry observations could\nconfirm the reflection hypothesis.\n", "  We use a density matrix formalism to study the equilibrium phases and\nnon-equilibrium dynamics of a system of dissipative Rydberg atoms in an optical\nlattice within mean-field theory. We provide equations for the fixed points of\nthe density matrix evolution for atoms with infinite on-site repulsion and\nanalyze these equations to obtain their Mott insulator- superfluid (MI-SF)\nphase boundary. A stability analysis around these fixed points provides us with\nthe excitation spectrum of the atoms both in the MI and SF phases. We study the\nnature of the MI-SF critical point in the presence of finite dissipation of\nRydberg excitations, discuss the fate of the superfluidity of the atoms in the\npresence of such dissipation in the weak-coupling limit using a coherent state\nrepresentation of the density matrix, and extend our analysis to Rydberg atoms\nwith finite on-site interaction via numerical solution of the density matrix\nequations. Finally, we vary the boson (atom) hopping parameter $J$ and the\ndissipation parameter $\\Gamma$ according to a linear ramp protocol. We study\nthe evolution of entropy of the system following such a ramp and show that the\ndeviation of the entropy from its steady state value for the latter protocol\nexhibits power-law behavior as a function of the ramp time. We discuss\nexperiments which can test our theory.\n", "  We study the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model with the aligned Yukawa sector (A2HDM)\nin light of the observed excess measured in the muon anomalous magnetic moment.\nWe take into account the existing theoretical and experimental constraints with\nup-to-date values and demonstrate that a phenomenologically interesting region\nof parameter space exists. With a detailed parameter scan, we show a much\nlarger region of viable parameter space in this model beyond the limiting case\nType X 2HDM as obtained before. It features the existence of light scalar\nstates with masses $3$ GeV $\\lesssim m_H^{} \\lesssim 50$ GeV, or $\\ 10$ GeV\n$\\lesssim m_A^{} \\lesssim 130$ GeV, with enhanced couplings to tau leptons. The\ncharged Higgs boson is typically heavier, with $200$ GeV $ \\lesssim m^{}_{H^+}\n\\lesssim 630$ GeV. The surviving parameter space is forced into the\nCP-conserving limit by EDM constraints. Some Standard Model observables may be\nsignificantly modified, including a possible new decay mode of the SM-like\nHiggs boson to four taus. We comment on future measurements and direct searches\nfor those effects at the LHC as tests of the model.\n", "  Topological materials are characterized by an electronic band structure with\nnontrivial topological properties. In this paper, we introduce a basis of\noperators for the linear space of operators spanned by charge-neutral fermion\nbilinears. These band projected density operators are constructed using\ndirectly the eigenfunctions of the electronic energy band structure and there\nis no need to assume a flat Berry curvature. As a result, our set of operators\nhas a wider range of validity and is sensitive to physical phenomena which are\nnot detectable in the flat curvature limit. In particular, we show that the\nBerry monopole configuration of Weyl semimetal give rises to a nonvanishing\nJacobiator for these band projected density operators, implying the emergence\nof nonassociativity at the location of the Weyl nodes. The resulting\nnonassociativity observes the fundamental identity, the defining property of\nthe Nambu bracket and so one may call this a nonassociative Nambu geometry. We\nalso derive the corresponding uncertainty principle.\n", "  We study the probability $p \\equiv p_\\eta(t)$ that two directed polymers in a\ngiven random potential $\\eta$ and with fixed and nearby endpoints, do not cross\nuntil time $t$. This probability is itself a random variable (over samples\n$\\eta$) which, as we show, acquires a very broad probability distribution at\nlarge time. In particular the moments of $p$ are found to be dominated by\natypical samples where $p$ is of order unity. Building on a formula established\nby us in a previous work using nested Bethe Ansatz and Macdonald process\nmethods, we obtain analytically the leading large time behavior of {\\it all\nmoments} $\\overline{p^m}\\simeq \\gamma_m/t$. From this, we extract the exact\ntail $\\sim \\rho(p)/t$ of the probability distribution of the non-crossing\nprobability at large time. The exact formula is compared to numerical\nsimulations, with excellent agreement.\n", "  We consider a static spherically symmetric thin shell wormhole collides with\nanother thin shell consisting of ordinary matter. By employing the geometrical\nconstraint, which leads to the conservation of energy and momentum, we show\nthat the state after the collision can be solved from the initial data. In the\nlow speed approximation, the solutions are rather simple. The shell may either\nbounce back or pass through the wormhole. In either case, the wormhole shrinks\nright after the collision. In the \"bouncing\" case, a surprising result is that\nthe radial speeds before and after the collision satisfy an addition law, which\nis independent of the masses of the wormhole and the shell. Once the shell\npasses through the wormhole, we find that the shell always expands. However,\nthe expansion rate is the same as its collapsing rate right before the\ncollision. Finally, we find out the solution for the shell moving together with\nthe wormhole.\n", "  Unencapsulated aluminum wedge wire bonds are common in particle physics pixel\nand strip detectors. Industry-favored bulk encapsulation is eschewed due to the\nrange of operating temperatures and radiation. Wire bond failures are a\npersistent source of tracking-detector failure. Unencapsulated bonds are\nvulnerable to condensation-induced corrosion, particularly when halides are\npresent. Oscillations from periodic Lorentz forces are documented as another\nsource of wire bond failure. Spray application of polyurethane coatings,\nperformance of polyurethane-coated wire bonds after climate chamber exposure,\nand resonant properties of polyurethane-coated wire bonds and their resistance\nto periodic Lorentz forces are under study for use in a future High Luminosity\nLarge Hadron Collider detector such as the ATLAS Inner Tracker upgrade.\n", "  We consider the semiclassical limit of the vacuum Virasoro block describing\nthe diagonal 4-point correlation functions on the sphere. At large central\ncharge c, after exponentiation, it depends on two fixed ratios h_H/c and h_L/c,\nwhere h_{H, L} are the conformal dimensions of the 4-point function operators.\nThe semiclassical block may be expanded in powers of the light ratio h_L/c and\nthe leading non-trivial (linear) order is known in closed form as a function of\nh_H/c. Recently, this contribution has been matched against AdS_3 gravity\ncalculations where heavy operators build up a classical geometry corresponding\nto a BTZ black hole, while the light operators are described by a geodesic in\nthis background. Here, we compute for the first time the next-to-leading\nquadratic correction O((h_L/c)^{2}), again in closed form for generic heavy\noperator ratio h_H/c. The result is a highly non-trivial extension of the\nleading order and may be relevant for further refined AdS_{3}/CFT_{2} tests.\nApplications to the two-interval R\\'enyi entropy are also presented.\n", "  We study the propagation of information through a Kitaev chain with\nlong-range pairing interactions. Although the Lieb-Robinson bound is violated\nin the strict sense for long-range interacting systems, we illustrate that a\nmajor amount of information in this model still propagates ballistically on a\nlight cone. We find a pronounced effect of the interaction range on the decay\nof the mutual information between spatially disconnected subsystems. A\nsignificant amount of information is shared at time-like separations. This\nregime is accompanied by very slow equilibration of local observables. As the\nKitaev model is quasi-free, we illustrate how the distribution of\nquasi-particle group velocities explains the physics of this system\nqualitatively.\n", "  Microorganisms develop coordinated beating patterns on surfaces lined with\ncilia known as metachronal waves. For a chain of cilia attached to a flat\nciliate, it has been shown that hydrodynamic interactions alone can lead the\nsystem to synchronize. However, several microorganisms possess a curve shaped\nciliate body and so to understand the effect of this geometry on the formation\nof metachronal waves, we evaluate the hydrodynamic interactions of cilia near a\nlarge spherical body. Using a minimal model, we show that for a chain of cilia\naround the sphere, the natural periodicity in the geometry leads the system to\nsynchronize. We also report an emergent wave-like behavior when an asymmetry is\nintroduced to the system.\n", "  We develop tools for the efficient evaluation of Wilson lines in 3D higher\nspin gravity, and use these to compute entanglement entropy in the\nhs$[\\lambda]$ Vasiliev theory that governs the bulk side of the duality\nproposal of Gaberdiel and Gopakumar. Our main technical advance is the\ndetermination of SL(N) Wilson lines for arbitrary $N$, which, in suitable\ncases, enables us to analytically continue to hs$[\\lambda]$ via $N \\rightarrow\n-\\lambda$. We apply this result to compute various quantities of interest,\nincluding entanglement entropy expanded perturbatively in the background higher\nspin charge, chemical potential, and interval size. This includes a computation\nof entanglement entropy in the higher spin black hole of the Vasiliev theory.\nThese results are consistent with conformal field theory calculations. We also\nprovide an alternative derivation of the Wilson line, by showing how it arises\nnaturally from earlier work on scalar correlators in higher spin theory. The\ngeneral picture that emerges is consistent with the statement that the SL(N)\nWilson line computes the semiclassical $W_N$ vacuum block, and our results\nprovide an explicit result for this object.\n", "  We probe the electrostatic cost associated with the approach phase of DNA\ntranslocation events. Within an analytical theory at the Debye-Huckel level, we\ncalculate the electrostatic free energy of a rigid DNA molecule interacting\nwith a dielectric membrane. For carbon or silicon based low permittivity\nneutral membranes, the DNA molecule experiences a repulsive energy barrier\nbetween 10 kBT and 100 kBT. In the case of engineered membranes with high\ndielectric permittivity, the membrane surface attracts the DNA with an energy\nof the same magnitude. Both the repulsive and attractive interactions result\nfrom image-charge effects and their magnitude survive even for the thinnest\ngraphene-based membranes of size d~6 A. For weakly charged membranes, the\nelectrostatic free energy is always attractive at large separation distances\nbut switches to repulsive close to the membrane surface. We also characterise\nthe polymer length dependence of the interaction energy. For specific values of\nthe membrane charge density, low permittivity membranes repel short polymers\nbut attract long polymers. Our results can be used to control the strong\nelectrostatic free energy of DNA-membrane interactions prior to translocation\nevents by chemical engineering of the relevant system parameters.\n", "  We investigate the Q-ball decay into the axino dark matter in the\ngauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking. In our scenario, the Q ball decays\nmainly into nucleons and partially into axinos to account respectively for the\nbaryon asymmetry and the dark matter of the universe. The Q ball decays well\nbefore the big bang nucleosynthesis so that it is not affected by the decay. We\nshow the region of the parameters which realizes this scenario.\n", "  We aim to unveil the observational imprint of physical mechanisms that govern\nplanetary formation in the young, multiple system GG Tau A. We present ALMA\nobservations of $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO 3-2 and 0.9 mm continuum emission with\n0.35\" resolution. The $^{12}$CO 3-2 emission, found within the cavity of the\ncircumternary dust ring (at radius $< 180$ AU) where no $^{13}$CO emission is\ndetected, confirms the presence of CO gas near the circumstellar disk of GG Tau\nAa. The outer disk and the recently detected hot spot lying at the outer edge\nof the dust ring are mapped both in $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO. The gas emission\nin the outer disk can be radially decomposed as a series of slightly\noverlapping Gaussian rings, suggesting the presence of unresolved gaps or dips.\nThe dip closest to the disk center lies at a radius very close to the hot spot\nlocation at $\\sim250-260$~AU. The CO excitation conditions indicate that the\nouter disk remains in the shadow of the ring. The hot spot probably results\nfrom local heating processes. The two latter points reinforce the hypothesis\nthat the hot spot is created by an embedded proto-planet shepherding the outer\ndisk.\n", "  We describe further details of the Stochastic Coupled Cluster method and a\ndiagnostic of such calculations, the shoulder height, akin to the plateau found\nin Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo. We describe an initiator\nmodification to Stochastic Coupled Cluster Theory and show that initiator\ncalculations can be extrapolated to the unbiased limit. We apply this method to\nthe 3D 14-electron uniform electron gas and present complete basis set limit\nvalues of the CCSD and previously unattainable CCSDT correlation energies for\nup to rs = 2, showing a requirement to include triple excitations to accurately\ncalculate energies at high densities.\n", "  The aim of our work is to develop a unified equation of state (EoS) for\nnuclear and quark matter for a wide range in temperature, density and isospin\nso that it becomes applicable for heavy-ion collisions as well as for the\nastrophysics of neutron stars, their mergers and supernova explosions. As a\nfirst step, we use improved EoS for the hadronic and quark matter phases and\njoin them via Maxwell construction. We discuss the limitations of a 2-phase\ndescription and outline steps beyond it, towards the formulation of a unified\nquark-nuclear matter EoS on a more fundamental level by a cluster virial\nexpansion.\n", "  I investigate the finite temperature Casimir effect for a charged and\nmassless scalar field satisfying mixed (Dirichlet-Neumann) boundary conditions\non a pair of plane parallel plates of infinite size. The effect of a uniform\nmagnetic field, perpendicular to the plates, on the Helmholtz free energy and\nCasimir pressure is studied. The zeta-function regularization technique is used\nto obtain finite results. Simple analytic expressions are obtained for the zeta\nfunction and the free energy, in the limits of small plate distance, high\ntemperature and strong magnetic field. The Casimir pressure is obtained in each\nof the three limits and the situation of a magnetic field present between and\noutside the plates, as well as that of a magnetic field present only between\nthe plates is examined. It is discovered that, in the small plate distance and\nhigh temperature limits, the repulsive pressure is less when the magnetic field\nis present between the plates but not outside, than it is when the magnetic\nfield is present between and outside the plates.\n", "  This Letter presents evidence for single top-quark production in the\n$s$-channel using proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8 TeV\nwith the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The analysis is\nperformed on events containing one isolated electron or muon, large missing\ntransverse momentum and exactly two $b$-tagged jets in the final state. The\nanalysed data set corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20.3 fb$^{-1}$.\nThe signal is extracted using a maximum-likelihood fit of a discriminant which\nis based on the matrix element method and optimized in order to separate\nsingle-top-quark $s$-channel events from the main background contributions,\nwhich are top-quark pair production and $W$ boson production in association\nwith heavy-flavour jets. The measurement leads to an observed signal\nsignificance of 3.2 standard deviations and a measured cross-section of\n$\\sigma_s=4.8\\pm0.8$(stat.)$^{+1.6}_{-1.3}$(syst.) pb, which is consistent with\nthe Standard Model expectation. The expected significance for the analysis is\n3.9 standard deviations.\n", "  It is shown that an idea proposed in 1996 that relates in a qualitatively\ncorrect way the inter-family mass hierarchies of the up quarks, down quarks,\ncharged leptons, and neutrinos, can be combined with a predictive scheme\nrecently proposed for relating quark mixing and neutrino mixing. In the\nresulting model, the entire flavor structure of the quarks and leptons is\nexpressible in terms of two \"master matrices\": a diagonal matrix that gives the\ninter-family mass ratios, and an off-diagonal matrix that controls all flavor\nmixing.\n", "  We have developed a passive 350 GHz (850 {\\mu}m) video-camera to demonstrate\nlumped element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKIDs) -- designed originally for\nfar-infrared astronomy -- as an option for general purpose terrestrial\nterahertz imaging applications. The camera currently operates at a quasi-video\nframe rate of 2 Hz with a noise equivalent temperature difference per frame of\n$\\sim$0.1 K, which is close to the background limit. The 152 element\nsuperconducting LEKID array is fabricated from a simple 40 nm aluminum film on\na silicon dielectric substrate and is read out through a single microwave\nfeedline with a cryogenic low noise amplifier and room temperature frequency\ndomain multiplexing electronics.\n", "  The formation of SMSs is a potential pathway to seed SMBHs in the early\nuniverse. A critical issue for forming SMSs is stellar UV feedback, which may\nlimit the stellar mass growth via accretion. In this paper we study the\nevolution of an accreting SMS and its UV emissivity under conditions of\nrealistic variable accretion from a self-gravitating circumstellar disc. First\nwe conduct a 2D hydrodynamical simulation to follow the long-term protostellar\naccretion until the stellar mass exceeds $10^4~M_\\odot$. The disc fragments due\nto gravitational instability, creating a number of small clumps that rapidly\nmigrate inward to fall onto the star. The resulting accretion history is thus\nhighly time-dependent: short episodic accretion bursts are followed by longer,\nrelative quiescent phases. We show that the circumstellar disc for the\nso-called direct collapse model is more unstable and generates greater\nvariability over shorter timescales than normal Pop III cases. We conduct a\npost-process stellar evolution calculation using the obtained accretion\nhistory. Our results show that, regardless of the strong variability of the\naccretion rates, the stellar radius monotonically increases with almost\nconstant effective temperature at $T_{\\rm eff} \\simeq 5000$ K as the stellar\nmass increases. The resulting UV feedback is too weak to hinder mass accretion\ndue to the low flux of stellar UV photons, thus verifying our implicit\nassumption of no stellar feedback during the hydrodynamic simulations. The\ninsensitivity of stellar evolution to variable accretion is attributed to the\nfact that typical timescales of variability, $\\lesssim 10^3$ years, are too\nshort to affect the stellar structure. We argue that this evolution will\ncontinue until the SMS eventually collapses to produce a massive black hole by\nthe general relativistic instability after the stellar mass reaches $\\gtrsim\n10^5~M_\\odot$.\n", "  We propose event by event velocity fluctuations of nuclear fission fragments\nas an additional interesting observable that gives access to the nuclear\ntemperature in an independent way from spectral measurements and relates the\ndiffusion and friction coefficients for the relative fragment coordinate in\nKramer-like models (in which some aspects of fission can be understood as the\ndiffusion of a collective variable through a potential barrier). We point out\nthat neutron emission by the heavy fragments can be treated in effective theory\nif corrections to the velocity distribution are needed.\n", "  Chiral phase transition of two flavor QCD at finite quark masses is known to\nbe crossover except near the chiral limit, but it can turn to a first order\ntransition when adding many extra flavors. This property is used to explore the\nnature of the phase transition of massless two flavor QCD using lattice\nnumerical simulations. The extra heavy flavors being incorporated in the form\nof the hopping parameter expansion through the reweighting, the number of the\nextra flavors and their masses appear only in a single parameter, defined by\n$h$. We determine the critical value of the parameter, at which the first order\nand the crossover regions are separated, and examine its dependence on the two\nflavor mass. The lattice calculations are carried out at $N_t$=4, and show that\nthe critical value does not depend on the two flavor mass in the range we have\nstudied ($0.46 \\le m_\\pi/m_\\rho \\le 0.66$) and appears to remain finite and\npositive in the chiral limit, suggesting that the phase transition of massless\ntwo flavor QCD is of second order.\n", "  The onset of dynamo action is investigated within the context of a newly\ndeveloped low Rossby, low magnetic Prandtl number, convection-driven dynamo\nmodel. This multiscale model represents an asymptotically exact form of an\n$\\alpha^2$ mean field dynamo model in which the small-scale convection is\nrepresented explicitly by finite amplitude, single mode solutions. Both steady\nand oscillatory convection are considered for a variety of horizontal\nplanforms. The kinetic helicity is observed to be a monotonically increasing\nfunction of the Rayleigh number. As a result, very small magnetic Prandtl\nnumber dynamos can be found for sufficiently large Rayleigh numbers. All\ndynamos are found to be oscillatory with an oscillation frequency that\nincreases as the strength of the convection is increased and the magnetic\nPrandtl number is reduced. Kinematic dynamo action is strongly controlled by\nthe profile of the helicity; single mode solutions which exhibit boundary layer\nbehavior in the helicity show a decrease in the efficiency of dynamo action due\nto the enhancement of magnetic diffusion in the boundary layer regions. For a\ngiven value of the Rayleigh number, lower magnetic Prandtl number dynamos are\nexcited for the case of oscillatory convection in comparison to steady\nconvection. With regards to planetary dynamos, these results suggest that the\nlow magnetic Prandtl number dynamos typical of liquid metals are more easily\ndriven by thermal convection than by compositional convection.\n", "  We report the long term performance of the photosensors, 143 one-inch\nR8520-406 and 37 three-inch R11410-MOD photomultipliers from Hamamatsu, in the\nfirst phase of the PandaX dual-phase xenon dark matter experiment. This is the\nfirst time that a significant number of R11410 photomultiplier tubes were\noperated in liquid xenon for an extended period, providing important guidance\nto the future large xenon-based dark matter experiments.\n", "  Bit commitment and coin flipping occupy a unique place in the\ndevice-independent landscape, as the only device-independent protocols thus far\nsuggested for these tasks are reliant on tripartite GHZ correlations. Indeed,\nwe know of no other bipartite tasks, which admit a device-independent\nformulation, but which are not known to be implementable using only bipartite\nnonlocality. Another interesting feature of these protocols is that the\npseudo-telepathic nature of GHZ correlations -- in contrast to the generally\nstatistical character of nonlocal correlations, such as those arising in the\nviolation of the CHSH inequality -- is essential to their formulation and\nanalysis. In this work, we present a device-independent bit commitment protocol\nbased on CHSH testing, which achieves the same security as the optimal\nGHZ-based protocol. The protocol is analyzed in the most general settings,\nwhere the devices are used repeatedly and may have long-term quantum memory. We\nalso recast the protocol in a post-quantum setting where both honest and\ndishonest parties are restricted only by the impossibility of signaling, and\nfind that overall the supra-quantum structure allows for greater security.\n", "  We study the sensitivity of current and future long-baseline neutrino\noscillation experiments to the effects of dimension six operators affecting\nneutrino propagation through Earth, commonly referred to as Non-Standard\nInteractions (NSI). All relevant parameters entering the oscillation\nprobabilities (standard and non-standard) are considered at once, in order to\ntake into account possible cancellations and degeneracies between them. We find\nthat the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment will significantly improve over\ncurrent constraints for most NSI parameters. Most notably, it will be able to\nrule out the so-called LMA-dark solution, still compatible with current\noscillation data, and will be sensitive to off-diagonal NSI parameters at the\nlevel of $\\varepsilon \\sim \\mathcal{O}(0.05 - 0.5)$. We also identify two\ndegeneracies among standard and non-standard parameters, which could be\npartially resolved by combining T2HK and DUNE data.\n", "  The objective of this paper is to explore the possibility to couple two van\nder Pol (vdP) oscillators via a resistance-capacitance (RC) network comprising\na Ag-TiOx-Al memristive device. The coupling was mediated by connecting the\ngate terminals of two programmable unijunction transistors (PUTs) through the\nnetwork. In the high resistance state (HRS) the memresistance was in the order\nof MOhm leading to two independent selfsustained oscillators characterized by\nthe different frequencies f1 and f2 and no phase relation between the\noscillations. After a few cycles and in dependency of the mediated pulse\namplitude the memristive device switched to the low resistance state (LRS) and\na frequency adaptation and phase locking was observed. The experimental results\nare underlined by theoretically considering a system of two coupled vdP\nequations. The presented neuromorphic circuitry conveys two essentials\nprinciple of interacting neuronal ensembles: synchronization and memory. The\nexperiment may path the way to larger neuromorphic networks in which the\ncoupling parameters can vary in time and strength and are realized by\nmemristive devices.\n", "  Cosmography represents an important branch of cosmology which aims to\ndescribe the universe without the need of postulating \\emph{a priori} any\nparticular cosmological model. All quantities of interest are expanded as a\nTaylor series around here and now, providing in principle, a way of directly\nmatching with cosmological data. In this way, cosmography can be regarded a\nmodel-independent technique, able to fix cosmic bounds, although several issues\nlimit its use in various model reconstructions. The main purpose of this review\nis to focus on the key features of cosmography, emphasising both the strategy\nfor obtaining the observable cosmographic series and pointing out any drawbacks\nwhich might plague the standard cosmographic treatment. In doing so, we relate\ncosmography to the most relevant cosmological quantities and to several dark\nenergy models. We also investigate whether cosmography is able to provide\ninformation about the form of the cosmological expansion history, discussing\nhow to reproduce the dark fluid from the cosmographic sound speed. Following\nthis, we discuss limits on cosmographic priors and focus on how to\nexperimentally treat cosmographic expansions. Finally, we present some of the\nlatest developments of the cosmographic method, reviewing the use of rational\napproximations, based on cosmographic Pad\\'e polynomials. Future prospects\nleading to more accurate cosmographic results, able to better reproduce the\nexpansion history of the universe are also discussed in detail.\n", "  The hydrophobic effect stabilizes the native structure of proteins by\nminimizing the unfavourable interactions between hydrophobic residues and water\nthrough the formation of a hydrophobic core. Here we include the entropic and\nenthalpic contributions of the hydrophobic effect explicitly in an implicit\nsolvent model. This allows us to capture two important effects: a length-scale\ndependence and a temperature dependence for the solvation of a hydrophobic\nparticle. This consistent treatment of the hydrophobic effect explains cold\ndenaturation and heat capacity measurements of solvated proteins.\n", "  Currently available separability criteria for continuous-variable states are\ngenerally based on the covariance matrix of quadrature operators. The\nwell-known separability criterion of Duan et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 2722\n(2000)] and Simon [Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 2726 (2000)] , for example, gives a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for a two-mode Gaussian state to be\nseparable, but leaves many entangled non-Gaussian states undetected. Here, we\nintroduce an improvement of this criterion that enables a stronger entanglement\ndetection. The improved condition is based on the knowledge of an additional\nparameter, namely the degree of Gaussianity, and exploits a connection with\nGaussianity-bounded uncertainty relations [Phys. Rev. A 86, 030102 (2012)]. We\nexhibit families of non-Gaussian entangled states whose entanglement remains\nundetected by the Duan-Simon criterion.\n", "  An electron beam has gained a maximum energy of 9 GeV per particle in a 1.3\nm-long electron beam-driven plasma wakefield accelerator. The amount of charge\naccelerated in the spectral peak was 28.3 pC, and the root-mean-square energy\nspread was 5.0%. The mean accelerated charge and energy gain per particle of\nthe 215 shot data set was 115 pC and 5.3 GeV, respectively, corresponding to an\nacceleration gradient of 4.0 GeV/m at the spectral peak. The mean energy spread\nof the data set was 5.1%. These results are consistent with the extrapolation\nof the previously reported energy gain results using a shorter, 36 cm-long\nplasma source to within 10%, evincing a non-evolving wake structure that can\npropagate distances of over a meter in length. Wake-loading effects were\nevident in the data through strong dependencies observed between various\nspectral properties and the amount of accelerated charge.\n", "  We apply the phenomenological Reggeon Field Theory framework to investigate\nthe relative importance of perturbative and nonperturbative multiparton\ncorrelations for the treatment of double parton scattering (DPS) in\nproton-proton collisions. We obtain a significant correction to the so-called\neffective cross section for DPS due to nonperturbative parton splitting. When\ncombined with the corresponding perturbative contribution, this results in a\nrather weak energy and transverse momentum dependence of the effective cross\nsection, in agreement with experimental observations at the Tevatron and the\nLarge Hadron Collider. In addition, we observed that color fluctuations have a\nsizable impact on the calculated rate of double parton scattering and on the\nrelative importance of the perturbative parton splitting mechanism.\n", "  Based on first principles calculations and self-consistent solution of\nlinearized Boltzmann-Peierls equation for phonon transport approach within a\nthree-phonon scattering framework, we characterize lattice thermal\nconductivities k of freestanding silicene, germanene and stanene under\ndifferent isotropic tensile strains and temperatures. We find a strong size\ndependence of k for silicene with tensile strain, i.e., divergent k with\nincreasing system size, in contrast, the intrinsic room temperature k for\nunstrained silicene converges with system size to 19.34 W/m-K by 178 nm. The\nroom temperature k of strained silicene becomes as large as that of bulk\nsilicon by 84 um, indicating the possibility of using strain in silicene to\nmanipulate k for thermal management. The relative contribution to the intrinsic\nk from out-of-plane acoustic modes is largest for unstrained silicene, about\n39% at room temperature. The single mode relaxation time approximation, which\nworks reasonably well for bulk silicon, fails to appropriately describe phonon\nthermal transport in silicene, germanene and stanene within the temperature\nrange considered. For large samples of silicene, k increases with tensile\nstrain, peaks at about 7% strain and then decreases with further strain. In\ngermanene and stanene increasing strain hardens and stabilizes long wavelength\nout-of-plane acoustic phonons, and leads to similar k behaviors to those of\nsilicene. These findings further our understanding of phonon dynamics in\ngroup-IV buckled monolayers and may guide transfer and fabrication techniques\nof these freestanding samples and engineering k by size and strain for\napplications of thermal management and thermoelectricity.\n", "  We study $F$ coupled $q$-state Potts models in a two-dimensional square\nlattice. The interaction between the different layers is attractive, to favour\na simultaneous alignment in all of them, and its strength is fixed. The nature\nof the phase transition for zero field is numerically determined for $F=2,3$.\nUsing the Lee-Kosterlitz method, we find that it is continuous for $F=2$ and\n$q=2$, whereas it is abrupt for higher values of $q$ and/or $F$. When a\ncontinuous or a weakly first-order phase transition takes place, we also\nanalyze the properties of the geometrical clusters. This allows us to determine\nthe fractal dimension $D$ of the incipient infinite cluster and to examine the\nfinite-size scaling of the cluster number density via data collapse. A\nmean-field approximation of the model, from which some general trends can be\ndetermined, is presented too. Finally, since this lattice model has been\nrecently considered as a thermodynamic counterpart of the Axelrod model of\nsocial dynamics, we discuss our results in connection with this one.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate a passively Q-switched erbium-doped fiber laser\n(EDFL) operation by using a saturable absorber based on Fe3O4 nanoparticles\n(FONP) in magnetic fluid (MF). As a kind of transition metal oxide, the FONP\nhas a large nonlinear optical response with a fast response time for saturable\nabsorber. By depositing MF at the end of optical fiber ferrule, we fabricated a\nFONP-based saturable absorber, which enables a strong light-matter interaction\nowing to the confined transmitted optical field within the single mode fiber.\nBecause of large third-order optical nonlinearities of FONP-based saturable\nabsorber, large modulation depth of 8.2% and non saturable absorption of 56.6%\nare demonstrated. As a result, stable passively Q-switched EDFL pulses with\nmaximum output pulse energy of 23.76 nJ, repetition rate of 33.3 kHz, and pulse\nwidth of 3.2 {\\mu}s are achieved when the input pump power is 110 mW at the\nwavelength of 980 nm. The laser features a low threshold pump power of ~15 mW.\n", "  The best possible precision is one of the key figures in metrology, but this\nis established by the exact response of the detection apparatus, which is often\nunknown. There exist techniques for detector characterisation, that have been\nintroduced in the context of quantum technologies, but apply as well for\nordinary classical coherence; these techniques, though, rely on intense data\nprocessing. Here we show that one can make use of the simpler approach of data\nfitting patterns in order to obtain an estimate of the Cram\\'er-Rao bound\nallowed by an unknown detector, and present applications in polarimetry.\nFurther, we show how this formalism provide a useful calculation tool in an\nestimation problem involving a continuous-variable quantum state, i.e. a\nquantum harmonic oscillator.\n", "  Inspired by the preliminary experimental data by the CLAS Collaboration, the\n$K^{\\ast 0}\\Lambda$ photoproduction off a neutron is studied within an\neffective Lagrangian approach. The contributions from the Born terms including\n$s$, $u$, and $t$ channels are considered to calculate the amplitude, with\nwhich the cross sections are calculated and compared with preliminary CLAS\ndata. The theoretical results indicate that the contribution from the\n$K$-exchange $t$ channel plays a dominant role for the $K^{\\ast 0}\\Lambda$\nphotoproduction. The contribution from the $\\kappa$ exchange is found one order\nof magnitude smaller than that from the $K$ exchange. Both the Regge model and\nthe Feynman model are applied to treat the $t$-channel contribution. The\ndiscrepancy between two models is found small in the energy range of CLAS data\nand predicted to become obvious at energies higher than 3 GeV. More precise\nexperimental data especially at backward angles will be helpful to further\nunderstand the interaction mechanism of the $K^{\\ast 0}\\Lambda$\nphotoproduction.\n", "  We study the effects of correlations on cumulants and their ratios of\nnet-proton multiplicity distributions which have been measured for central\n(0\\%-5\\%) Au + Au collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC).\nThis effect has been studied assuming individual proton and anti-proton\ndistributions as a Poisson or Negative Binomial Distribution (NBD). In-spite of\nsignificantly correlated production due to baryon number, electric charge\nconservation and kinematical correlations of protons and anti-protons, the\nmeasured cumulants of the net-proton distribution follow the independent\nproduction model. In the present work we demonstrate how the introduction of\nthe correlations will affect the cumulants and their ratios for the difference\ndistributions. We have also demonstrated this study using the proton and\nanti-proton distributions obtained from the HIJING event generator.\n", "  The dynamics of spontaneous emission of an atomic system is studied in the\nframework of an open quantum system. The resulting quantum master equation for\nthe atomic system is non hermitian. The generator $\\mathcal{L}$ can possess\nnon-hermitian degeneracies, i.e. exceptional points ($EP$), for specific values\nof the external laser driving amplitude and detuning from the atomic lines. We\nsuggest to employ the special properties of these $EP$s for accurate parameter\nestimation. The method is demonstrated for the atomic spectrum of $S\n\\rightarrow P$ transitions of $~^{85}$Rb and $~^{40}$Ca$~^+$.\n", "  We present a numerical analysis of the particle creation for a quantum field\nin the presence of time dependent boundary conditions. Having in mind recent\nexperiments involving superconducting circuits, we consider their description\nin terms of a scalar field in a one dimensional cavity satisfying generalized\nboundary conditions that involve a time-dependent linear combination of the\nfield and its spatial and time derivatives. We evaluate numerically the\nBogoliubov transformation between {\\it in} and {\\it out}-states and find that\nthe rate of particle production strongly depends on whether the spectrum of the\nunperturbed cavity is equidistant or not, and also on the amplitude of the\ntemporal oscillations of the boundary conditions. We provide analytic\njustifications for the different regimes found numerically.\n", "  We present the first calculation of the electromagnetic form factor of the\n$\\pi$ meson at physical light quark masses. We use configurations generated by\nthe MILC collaboration including the effect of $u$, $d$, $s$ and $c$ sea quarks\nwith the Highly Improved Staggered Quark formalism. We work at three values of\nthe lattice spacing on large volumes and with $u$/$d$ quark masses going down\nto the physical value. We study scalar and vector form factors for a range in\nspace-like $q^2$ from 0.0 to -0.1 $\\mathrm{GeV}^2$ and from their shape we\nextract mean square radii. Our vector form factor agrees well with experiment\nand we find $\\langle r^2 \\rangle_V = 0.403(18)(6) \\,\\mathrm{fm}^2$. For the\nscalar form factor we include quark-line disconnected contributions which have\na significant impact on the radius. We give the first results for SU(3)\nflavour-singlet and octet scalar mean square radii, obtaining: $\\langle r^2\n\\rangle_S^{\\mathrm{singlet}} = 0.506(38)(53) \\mathrm{fm}^2$ and $\\langle r^2\n\\rangle_S^{\\mathrm{octet}} = 0.431(38)(46) \\mathrm{fm}^2$. We discuss the\ncomparison with expectations from chiral perturbation theory.\n", "  We obtain constraints on four-lepton interactions in the effective field\ntheory with dimension-6 operators. To this end, we combine the experimental\ninput from Z boson measurements in LEP-1, W boson mass and decays, muon and tau\ndecays, lepton pair production in LEP-2, neutrino scattering on electrons, and\nparity violating electron scattering. The analysis does not rely on any\nassumptions about the flavor structure of the dimension-6 operators. Our main\nresults are the confidence intervals for Wilson coefficients of 16\nlepton-flavor conserving four-lepton operators, together with the full\ncorrelation matrix. Consequences for leptophilic models beyond the Standard\nModel are discussed.\n", "  We present an on-the-fly geometrical approach for shock detection and Mach\nnumber calculation in simulations employing smoothed particle hydrodynamics\n(SPH). We utilize pressure gradients to select shock candidates and define up-\nand downstream positions. We obtain hydrodynamical states in the up- and\ndownstream regimes with a series of normal and inverted kernel weightings\nparallel and perpendicular to the shock normals. Our on-the-fly geometrical\nMach detector incorporates well within the SPH formalism and has low\ncomputational cost.\n  We implement our Mach detector into the simulation code GADGET and alongside\nmany SPH improvements. We test our shock finder in a sequence of shock-tube\ntests with successively increasing Mach numbers exceeding by far the typical\nvalues inside galaxy clusters. For all shocks, we resolve the shocks well and\nthe correct Mach numbers are assigned. An application to a strong magnetized\nshock-tube gives stable results in full magnetohydrodynamic set-ups. We\nsimulate a merger of two idealized galaxy clusters and study the shock front.\nShock structures within the merging clusters as well as the cluster shock are\nwell-captured by our algorithm and assigned correct Mach numbers.\n", "  We propose a framework to realize helical edge states in phononic systems\nusing two identical lattices with interlayer couplings between them. A\nmethodology is presented to systematically transform a quantum mechanical\nlattice which exhibits edge states to a phononic lattice, thereby developing a\nfamily of lattices with edge states. Parameter spaces with topological phase\nboundaries in the vicinity of the transformed system are illustrated to\ndemonstrate the robustness to mechanical imperfections. A potential realization\nin terms of fundamental mechanical building blocks is presented for the\nhexagonal and Lieb lattices. The lattices are composed of passive components\nand the building blocks are a set of disks and linear springs. Furthermore, by\nvarying the spring stiffness, topological phase transitions are observed,\nillustrating the potential for tunability of our lattices.\n", "  We present the results of the study of an optical resonant cell filled by a\nvapor of the Rb atoms and coated with a non-stick polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)\npolymer. We show that it is possible to define correctly the diffusion\ncoefficient of the atoms in the coating, using geometric parameters of the cell\nand the vapor density in the cell volume only. The dependence of the diffusion\ncoefficient on the cell curing time is presented. It is shown that the\nmysterious cell curing process can be explained in terms of the polymerization\nof the polymer coating by alkali atoms. Anomalous long dwell time of the Rb\natoms on the PDMS coating is discussed as well.\n", "  Vortex solutions are topologically stable field configurations that can play\nan important role in condensed matter, field theory, and cosmology. We\ninvestigate vortex configuration in a 2+1 dimensional Abelian Higgs theory\nsupplemented by higher order derivative self-interactions, related with\nGalileons. Our vortex solutions have features that make them qualitatively\ndifferent from well-known Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen configurations, since the\nderivative interactions turn on gauge invariant field profiles that break axial\nsymmetry. By promoting the system to a 3+1 dimensional string configuration, we\nstudy its gravitational backreaction. Our results are all derived within a\nspecific, analytically manageable system, and might offer indications for\nunderstanding Galileonic interactions and screening mechanisms around\nconfigurations that are not spherically symmetric, but only at most\ncylindrically symmetric.\n", "  We report herschel observations of 100 very luminous, optically selected AGNs\nat z=2-3.5 with log(LUV)(erg/sec)> 46.5, where LUV=L1350A. The distribution in\nLUV is similar to the general distribution of SDSS AGNs in this redshift and\nluminosity interval. We measured SF luminosity, LSF, and SFR in 34 detected\nsources by fitting combined SF and WISE-based torus templates. We also obtained\nstatistically significant stacks for the undetected sources in two luminosity\ngroups. The sample properties are compared with those of very luminous AGNs at\nz>4.5. The main findings are: 1) The mean and the median SFRs of the detected\nsources are 1176 and 1010 Msun/yr, respectively. The mean SFR of the undetected\nsources is 148 Msun/yr. The ratio of SFR to BH accretion rate is approximately\n80 for the detected sources and less than 10 for the undetected sources. There\nis no difference in LAGN and only a very small difference in L(torus) between\ndetected and undetected sources. 2) The redshift distribution of LSF and LAGN\nfor the most luminous, redshift 2-7 AGNs are different. The highest LAGN are\nfound at z=~3. However, LSF of such sources peaks at z=~5. Assuming the objects\nin our sample are hosted by the most massive galaxies at those redshifts, we\nfind many of them are below the main-sequence of SF galaxies at z=2-3.5. 3) The\nSEDs of dusty tori at high redshift are similar to those found in low redshift,\nlow luminosity AGNs. Herschel upper limits put strong constraints on the long\nwavelength SED ruling out several earlier suggested torus templates. 4) We find\nno evidence for a luminosity dependence of the torus covering factor in sources\nwith log(LAGN)=44-47.5. This conclusion is based on the highly uncertain and\nnon-uniformally treated LAGN in many earlier studies. The median covering\nfactors over this range are 0.68 for isotropic dust emission and 0.4 for\nanisotropic emission.\n", "  We show how approximate Minimal Flavour Violation (MFV) can emerge from an\nSU(5) Supersymmetric Grand Unified Theory (SUSY GUT) supplemented by an S4 x\nU(1) family symmetry, which provides a good description of all quark and lepton\n(including neutrino) masses, mixings and CP violation. Assuming a SUSY breaking\nmechanism which respects the family symmetry, we calculate in full explicit\ndetail the low energy mass insertion parameters in the super-CKM basis,\nincluding the effects of canonical normalisation and renormalisation group\nrunning. We find that the very simple family symmetry S4 x U(1) is sufficient\nto approximately reproduce the effects of low energy MFV.\n", "  Three-dimensional Dirac semimetals, a three-dimensional analogue of graphene,\nare unusual quantum materials with massless Dirac fermions, which can be\nfurther converted to Weyl fermions by breaking time reversal or inversion\nsymmetry. Topological surface states with Fermi arcs are predicted on the\nsurface and have been observed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\nexperiments. Although the exotic transport properties of the bulk Dirac cones\nhave been demonstrated, it is still a challenge to reveal the surface states\nvia transport measurements due to the highly conductive bulk states. Here, we\nshow Aharonov-Bohm oscillations in individual single-crystal Cd3As2 nanowires\nwith low carrier concentration and large surface-to-volume ratio, providing\ntransport evidence of the surface state in three-dimensional Dirac semimetals.\nMoreover, the quantum transport can be modulated by tuning the Fermi level\nusing a gate voltage, enabling a deeper understanding of rich physics residing\nin Dirac semimetals.\n", "  We derived the conditions on certain combinations of integrals of the\nfragmentation functions of pion using HERMES data of the sum for the charged\npion multiplicities from semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (SIDIS) off\nthe deuteron target. In our derivation the nucleon parton distribution\nfunctions (PDFs) are assumed to be isospin SU(2) symmetric. Similar conditions\nhave also been obtained for the fragmentation functions (FFs) of kaon by the\nsum of charged kaon multiplicities as well. We have chosen several FFs to study\nthe impact of those conditions we have derived. Among those FFs, only that\nproduced in the nonlocal chiral-quark model (NL$\\chi$QM) constantly satisfy the\nconditions. Furthermore, the ratios of the strange PDFs $S(x)$ and the\nnonstrange PDFs $Q(x,Q^2)$ extracted from the charged pion and kaon\nmultiplicities differ from each other significantly. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat the HERMES pion multiplicity data is unlikely to be compatible with the\ntwo widely-used PDFs, namely CTEQ6M and NNPDF3.0.\n", "  An excess of X-ray emission below 1 keV, called soft excess, is detected in a\nlarge fraction of Seyfert 1-1.5s. The origin of this feature remains debated,\nas several models have been suggested to explain it, including warm\nComptonization and blurred ionized reflection. In order to constrain the origin\nof this component, we exploit the different behaviors of these models above 10\nkeV. Ionized reflection covers a broad energy range, from the soft X-rays to\nthe hard X-rays, while Comptonization drops very quickly in the soft X-rays. We\npresent here the results of a study done on 102 Seyfert 1s (Sy 1.0, 1.2, 1.5\nand NLSy1) from the Swift/BAT 70-Month Hard X-ray Survey catalog. The joint\nspectral analysis of Swift/BAT and XMM-Newton data allows a hard X-ray view of\nthe soft excess that is present in about 80% of the objects of our sample. We\ndiscuss how the soft-excess strength is linked to the reflection at high\nenergy, to the photon index of the primary continuum and to the Eddington\nratio. In particular, we find a positive dependence of the soft-excess\nintensity on the Eddington ratio. We compare our results to simulations of\nblurred ionized-reflection models and show that they are in contradiction. By\nstacking both XMM-Newton and Swift/BAT spectra per soft-excess strength, we see\nthat the shape of reflection at hard X-rays stays constant when the soft excess\nvaries, showing an absence of link between reflection and soft excess. We\nconclude that the ionized-reflection model as the origin of the soft excess is\ndisadvantaged in favor of the warm Comptonization model in our sample of\nSeyfert 1s.\n", "  We present the calculation of the NLO QCD corrections to the electroweak\nproduction of top-antitop pairs at the CERN LHC in the presence of a new\nneutral gauge boson. The corrections are implemented in the parton shower Monte\nCarlo program POWHEG. Standard Model (SM) and new physics interference effects\nare properly taken into account. QED singularities, first appearing at this\norder, are consistently subtracted. Numerical results are presented for SM and\n$Z'$ total cross sections and distributions in invariant mass, transverse\nmomentum, azimuthal angle and rapidity of the top-quark pair. The remaining\ntheoretical uncertainty from scale and PDF variations is estimated, and the\npotential of the charge asymmetry to distinguish between new physics models is\ninvestigated for the Sequential SM and a leptophobic topcolor model.\n", "  We calculate transverse momentum dependent quark splitting kernels $P_{gq}$\nand $P_{qq}$ within $k_T$-factorization, completing earlier results which\nconcentrated on gluon splitting functions $P_{gg}$ and $P_{qg}$. The complete\nset of splitting kernels is an essential requirement for the formulation of a\ncomplete set of evolution equations for transverse momentum dependent parton\ndistribution functions and the development of corresponding parton shower\nalgorithms.\n", "  We derive two types of sets of higher-order conditions for bipartite\nentanglement in terms of continuous variables. One corresponds to an extension\nof the well-known Duan inequalities from second to higher moments describing a\nkind of higher-order Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations. Only the\nsecond type, however, expressed by powers of the mode operators leads to tight\nconditions with a hierarchical structure. We start with a minimization problem\nfor the single-partite case and, using the results obtained, establish relevant\ninequalities for higher-order moments satisfied by all bipartite separable\nstates. A certain fourth-order condition cannot be violated by any Gaussian\nstate and we present non-Gaussian states whose entanglement is detected by that\ncondition. Violations of all our conditions are provided, so they can all be\nused as entanglement tests.\n", "  Two recent articles by Norman H. March that contain misleading statements\nconcerning 3D Ising models, partly based on earlier erroneous work of Z.D.\nZhang, are addressed.\n", "  Isovector and isoscalar dipole excitations in $^9$Be and $^{10}$Be are\ninvestigated in the framework of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics, in which\nangular-momentum and parity projections are performed. In the present method,\n1p-1h excitations on the ground state and large amplitude $\\alpha$-cluster mode\nare incorporated. The isovector giant dipole resonance (GDR) in $E>20$ MeV\nshows the two peak structure which is understood by the dipole excitation in\nthe 2$\\alpha$ core part with the prolate deformation. Because of valence\nneutron modes against the $2\\alpha$ core, low-energy E1 resonances appear in\n$E<20$ MeV exhausting about $20\\%$ of the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule and\n$10\\%$ of the calculated energy-weighted sum. The dipole resonance at $E\\sim\n15$ MeV in $^{10}$Be can be interpreted as the parity partner of the ground\nstate having a $^6$He+$\\alpha$ structure and has the remarkable E1 strength\nbecause of coherent contribution of two valence neutrons. The ISD strength for\nsome low-energy resonances are significantly enhanced by the coupling with the\n$\\alpha$-cluster mode. The calculated E1 strength of $^9$Be reasonably\ndescribes the global feature of experimental photonuclear cross sections\nconsisting of the low-energy strength in $E<20$ MeV and the GDR in $E>20$ MeV.\n", "  First-principles alloy theory is used to establish the $\\gamma$-surface of\nFe-Cr-Ni alloys as function of chemical composition and temperature. The\ntheoretical stacking fault energy (SFE) versus chemistry and temperature trends\nagree well with experiments. Combining our results with the recent plasticity\ntheory based on the $\\gamma$-surface, the stacking fault formation is predicted\nto be the leading deformation mechanism for alloys with effective stacking\nfault energy below about 18 mJ m$^{-2}$. Alloys with SFE above this critical\nvalue show both twinning and full slip at room temperature and twinning remains\na possible deformation mode even at elevated temperatures, in line with\nobservations.\n", "  We investigate how different interface geometries of an Al/Al$_2$O$_3$\njunction, a common component of modern tunnel devices, affect electron\ntransport through the tunnel barrier. We study six distinct Al/Al$_2$O$_3$\ninterfaces which differ in stacking sequences of the metal and the oxide\nsurface atoms and the oxide termination. To construct model potential barrier\nprofiles for each examined geometry, we rely on first-principles\ndensity-functional theory (DFT) calculations for the barrier heights and the\nshapes of the interface regions as well as on experimental data for the barrier\nwidths. We show that even tiny variations in the atomic arrangement at the\ninterface cause significant changes in the tunnel barrier parameters and,\nconsequently, in electron transport properties. Especially, we obtain that\nvariations in the crucial barrier heights and widths can be as large as 2 eV\nand 5 \\AA, respectively. Finally, to gain information about the average\nproperties of the measured junction, we fit the conductance calculated within\nthe WKB approximation to the experimental data and interpret the fit parameters\nwith the help of the DFT results.\n", "  We present measurements of Coulomb drag in an ambipolar GaAs/AlGaAs double\nquantum well structure that can be configured as both an electron-hole bilayer\nand a hole-hole bilayer, with an insulating barrier of only 10 nm between the\ntwo quantum wells. The Coulomb drag resistivity is a direct measure of the\nstrength of the interlayer particle-particle interactions. We explore the\nstrongly interacting regime of low carrier densities (2D interaction parameter\n$r_s$ up to 14). Our ambipolar device design allows comparison between the\neffects of the attractive electron-hole and repulsive hole-hole interactions,\nand also shows the effects of the different effective masses of electrons and\nholes in GaAs.\n", "  Transport experiments on the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) confined\ninto a semiconductor quantum well and subjected to a quantizing magnetic field\nhave uncovered a rich variety of uniform and nonuniform phases such as the\nLaughlin liquids, the Wigner, bubble and Skyrme crystals and the quantum Hall\nstripe state. Optically pumped nuclear magnetic resonance (OP-NMR) has also\nbeen extremely useful in studying the magnetization and dynamics of electron\nsolids with exotic spin textures such as the Skyrme crystal. Recently, it has\nbeen demonstrated that a related technique, resistively-detected nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (RD-NMR), could be a good tool to study the topography of\nthe electron solids in the fractional and integer quantum Hall regimes. In this\nwork, we compute theoretically the RD-NMR line shapes of various crystal phases\nof the 2DEG and study the relation between their spin density and texture and\ntheir NMR spectra. This allows us to evaluate the ability of the RD-NMR to\ndiscriminate between the various types of crystal states.\n", "  Recent interest in human dynamics has stimulated the investigation of the\nstochastic processes that explain human behaviour in various contexts, such as\nmobile phone networks and social media. In this paper, we extend the stochastic\nurn-based model proposed in \\cite{FENN15} so that it can generate mixture\nmodels,in particular, a mixture of exponential distributions. The model is\ndesigned to capture the dynamics of survival analysis, traditionally employed\nin clinical trials, reliability analysis in engineering, and more recently in\nthe analysis of large data sets recording human dynamics. The mixture modelling\napproach, which is relatively simple and well understood, is very effective in\ncapturing heterogeneity in data. We provide empirical evidence for the validity\nof the model, using a data set of popular search engine queries collected over\na period of 114 months. We show that the survival function of these queries is\nclosely matched by the exponential mixture solution for our model.\n", "  We have studied a sample of 89 very isolated, elliptical galaxies at z < 0.08\nand compared their properties with elliptical galaxies located in a\nhigh-density environment such as the Coma supercluster. Our aim is to probe the\nrole of environment on the morphological transformation and quenching of\nelliptical galaxies as a function of mass. In addition, we elucidate the nature\nof a particular set of blue and star-forming isolated ellipticals identified\nhere. We study physical properties of ellipticals such as color, specific star\nformation rate, galaxy size, and stellar age, as a function of stellar mass and\nenvironment based on SDSS data. We analyze the blue star-forming isolated\nellipticals in more detail, through photometric characterization using GALFIT,\nand infer their star formation history using STARLIGHT. Among the isolated\nellipticals ~ 20% are blue, 8% are star forming, and ~ 10% are recently\nquenched, while among the Coma ellipticals ~ 8% are blue and just <= 1% are\nstar forming or recently quenched. There are four isolated galaxies (~ 4.5%)\nthat are blue and star forming at the same time. These galaxies, with masses\nbetween 7 x 10^9 and 2 x 10^10 h-2 M_sun, are also the youngest galaxies with\nlight-weighted stellar ages <= 1 Gyr and exhibit bluer colors toward the galaxy\ncenter. Around 30-60% of their present-day luminosity, but only < 5% of their\npresent-day mass, is due to star formation in the last 1 Gyr. The processes of\nmorphological transformation and quenching seem to be in general independent of\nenvironment since most of elliptical galaxies are 'red and dead', although the\ntransition to the red sequence should be faster for isolated ellipticals. In\nsome cases, the isolated environment seems to propitiate the rejuvenation of\nellipticals by recent (< 1 Gyr) cold gas accretion.\n", "  We perform a systematic study on the spin decomposition of an electron in QED\nat one-loop order. It is found that the electron orbital angular momentum\ndefined in Jaffe-Manohar and Ji spin sum rules agrees with each other, and the\nso-called potential angular momentum vanishes at this order. The calculations\nare performed in both dimensional regularization and Pauli-Villars\nregularization for the ultraviolet divergences, and they lead to consistent\nresults. We further investigate the calculations in terms of light-front wave\nfunctions, and find a missing contribution from the instantaneous interaction\nin light-front quantization. This clarifies the confusing issues raised\nrecently in the literature on the spin decomposition of an electron, and will\nhelp to consolidate the spin physics program for nucleons in QCD.\n", "  We investigate the plausibility of a cometary source of the unusual transits\nobserved in the KIC 8462852 light curve. A single comet of similar size to\nthose in our solar system produces a transit depth of the order of $10^{-3}$\nlasting less than a day which is much smaller and shorter than the largest dip\nobserved ($\\sim20\\%$ for $\\sim3$ days), but a large, closely traveling cluster\nof comets can fit the observed depths and durations. We find that a series of\nlarge comet swarms, with all but one on the same orbit, provides a good fit for\nthe KIC 8462852 data during Quarters 16 and 17, but does not explain the large\ndip observed during Quarter 8. However, the transit dips only loosely constrain\nthe orbits and can be fit by swarms with periastrons differing by a factor of\n10. To reach a transit depth of $\\sim0.2$, the comets need to be in a close\ngroup of $\\sim30$, if they are $\\sim100$ km in radius or in a group of\n$\\sim300$ if they are $\\sim10$ km in radius. The total number of comets\nrequired to fit all of the dips is $\\sim70$ $\\sim$100 km or $\\sim700$ $\\sim10$\nkm comets. A single comet family from a tidally disrupted Ceres-sized\nprogenitor or the start of a Late Heavy Bombardment period explains the last\n$\\sim60$ days of the unusual KIC 8462852 light curve.\n", "  The transport properties of neutron star matter play an important role in\nmany astrophysical processes. We report the results of a calculation of the\nshear viscosity and thermal conductivity coefficients of the hard-sphere\nfermion system of degeneracy $\\nu$=2, that can be regarded as a model of pure\nneutron matter. Our approach is based on the effective interaction obtained\nfrom the formalism of correlated basis functions and the cluster expansion\ntechnique. The resulting transport coefficients show a strong sensitivity to\nthe quasiparticle effective mass, reflecting the effect of second order\ncontributions to the self-energy that are not taken into account in nuclear\nmatter studies available in the literature.\n", "  We compute radiative corrections to $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda$ from factors, at\nnext-to-leading logarithmic accuracy, from QCD light-cone sum rules with\n$\\Lambda_b$-baryon distribution amplitudes. Employing the diagrammatic approach\nfactorization of the vacuum-to-$\\Lambda_b$-baryon correlation function is\njustified at leading power in $\\Lambda/m_b$, with the aid of the method of\nregions. Hard functions entering the factorization formulae are identical to\nthe corresponding matching coefficients of heavy-to-light currents from QCD\nonto soft-collinear effective theory. The universal jet function from\nintegrating out the hard-collinear fluctuations exhibits richer structures\ncompared with the one involved in the factorization expressions of the\nvacuum-to-$B$-meson correlation function. Based upon the QCD resummation\nimproved sum rules we observe that the perturbative corrections at ${\\cal\nO}(\\alpha_s)$ shift the $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda$ from factors at large recoil\nsignificantly and the dominant contribution originates from the next-to-leading\norder jet function instead of the hard coefficient functions. Having at hand\nthe sum rule predictions for the $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda$ from factors we\nfurther investigate several decay observables in the electro-weak penguin\n$\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda \\, \\ell^{+} \\ell^{-}$ transitions in the factorization\nlimit (i.e., ignoring the \"non-factorizable\" hadronic effects which cannot be\nexpressed in terms of the $\\Lambda_b \\to \\Lambda$ from factors), including the\ninvariant mass distribution of the lepton pair, the forward-backward asymmetry\nin the dilepton system and the longitudinal polarization fraction of the\nleptonic sector.\n", "  The crossover from back-and-forth jumps between structural minima to the\nno-return jumps of the viscous flow is modeled in terms of an ensemble of\ndouble-well potentials with a finite decay probability. The ensemble is\ncharacterized by the Kohlrausch-exponent $\\beta$ of the time dependence\n$t^\\beta$ of the response at short times. The model is applied to shear and\ndielectric data from the literature.\n", "  One of the important objectives of the COMPASS experiment (CERN, SPS north\narea) is the exploration of transverse spin structure of nucleon via study of\nspin (in)dependent azimuthal asymmetries with semi-inclusive deep inelastic\nscattering (SIDIS) processes and recently also with Drell-Yan (DY) reactions.\nIn the past twelve years series of measurements were made in COMPASS, using 160\nGeV/c longitudinally polarized muon beam and polarized $^6LiD$ and $NH_3$\ntargets. Drell-Yan measurements with high energy (190 GeV/c) pion beam and\ntransversely polarized $NH_3$ target started in 2014 with a pilot-run have been\nfollowed by 140 days of data taking in 2015. The experimental results obtained\nby COMPASS for azimuthal effects in SIDIS play an important role in the general\nunderstanding of the three-dimensional nature of the nucleon and are widely\nused in theoretical analyses and global data fits. In addition, future first\never polarized DY-data from COMPASS compared with SIDIS results will open a new\nchapter probing general principles of QCD TMD-formalism. In this review main\nfocus is given to the very recent results obtained by the COMPASS collaboration\nfrom first ever multi-dimensional extraction of SIDIS transverse spin\nasymmetries.\n", "  Linear spectral transformations of orthogonal polynomials in the real line,\nand in particular Geronimus transformations, are extended to orthogonal\npolynomials depending on several real variables. Multivariate\nChristoffel-Geronimus-Uvarov formulae for the perturbed orthogonal polynomials\nand their quasi-tau matrices are found for each perturbation of the original\nlinear functional. These expressions are given in terms of quasi-determinants\nof bordered truncated block matrices and the 1D Christoffel-Geronimus-Uvarov\nformulae in terms of quotient of determinants of combinations of the original\northogonal polynomials and their Cauchy transforms, are recovered. A new\nmultispectral Toda hierarchy of nonlinear partial differential equations, for\nwhich the multivariate orthogonal polynomials are reductions, is proposed. This\nnew integrable hierachy is associated with non-standard multivariate\nbiorthogonality. Wave and Baker functions, linear equations, Lax and\nZakharov-Shabat equations, KP type equations, appropriate reductions,\nDarboux/linear spectral transformations, and bilinear equations involving\nlinear spectral transformations are presented.\n", "  The structure of few-fermion systems having $1/2$ spin-isospin symmetry is\nstudied using potential models. The strength and range of the two-body\npotentials are fixed to describe low energy observables in the angular momentum\n$L=0$ state and spin $S=0,1$ channels of the two-body system. Successively the\nstrength of the potentials are varied in order to explore energy regions in\nwhich the two-body scattering lengths are close to the unitary limit. This\nstudy is motivated by the fact that in the nuclear system the singlet and\ntriplet scattering lengths are both large with respect to the range of the\ninteraction. Accordingly we expect evidence of universal behavior in the three-\nand four-nucleon systems that can be observed from the study of correlations\nbetween observables. In particular we concentrate in the behavior of the first\nexcited state of the three-nucleon system as the system moves away from the\nunitary limit. We also analyze the dependence on the range of the three-body\nforce of some low-energy observables in the three- and four-nucleon systems.\n", "  Most of compact binary systems are expected to circularize before the\nfrequency of emitted gravitational waves (GWs) enters the sensitivity band of\nthe ground based interferometric detectors. However, several mechanisms have\nbeen proposed for the formation of binary systems, which retain eccentricity\nthroughout their lifetimes. Since no matched-filtering algorithm has been\ndeveloped to extract continuous GW signals from compact binaries on orbits with\nlow to moderate values of eccentricity, and available algorithms to detect\nbinaries on quasi-circular orbits are sub-optimal to recover these events, in\nthis paper we propose a search method for detection of gravitational waves\nproduced from the coalescences of eccentric binary black holes (eBBH). We study\nthe search sensitivity and the false alarm rates on a segment of data from the\nsecond joint science run of LIGO and Virgo detectors, and discuss the\nimplications of the eccentric binary search for the advanced GW detectors.\n", "  Size bidisperse granular materials in a spherical tumbler segregate into two\ndifferent patterns of three bands with either small particles at the equator\nand large particles at the poles or vice versa, depending upon the fill level\nin the tumbler. Here we use discrete element method (DEM) simulations with\nsupporting qualitative experiments to explore the effect of the tumbler wall\nroughness on the segregation pattern, modeling the tumbler walls as either a\nclosely packed monolayer of fixed particles resulting in a rough wall, or as a\ngeometrically smooth wall. Even though the tumbler wall is in contact with the\nflowing layer only at its periphery, the impact of wall roughness is profound.\nSmooth walls tend toward a small-large-small (SLS) band pattern at the\npole-equator-pole at all but the highest fill fractions; rough walls tend\ntoward a large-small-large (LSL) band pattern at all but the lowest fill\nfractions. This comes about because smooth walls induce poleward axial drift of\nsmall particles and an equator-directed drift for large particles, resulting in\nan SLS band pattern. On the other hand, rough walls result in both sizes of\nparticles moving poleward at the surface of the flow, but due to radial\nsegregation, small particles percolate lower in the flowing layer where there\nis a return drift toward the equator while large particles remain at the\nsurface near the pole, resulting in an LSL band pattern. The tendency toward\neither of the two band patterns depends on the fill level in the tumbler and\nthe roughness of the tumbler's bounding wall.\n", "  We study effects of D-brane instantons wrapping rigid cycles on Z2*Z2'\ntoroidal orbifold. We compute Majorana masses induced by rigid D-brane\ninstantons and realize bimaximal mixing matrices in certain models. We can also\nderive more generic mass matrices in other models. The bimaximal mixing\nMajorana mass matrix has a possibility to explain observed mixing angles. We\nalso compute the mu-term matrix among more than one pairs of Higgs fields\ninduced by rigid D-brane instantons.\n", "  In a recent paper we showed that the Minimal R-symmetric Supersymmetric\nStandard Model (MRSSM) can accommodate the observed 125 GeV Higgs boson as the\nlightest scalar of the model in agreement with electroweak precision\nobservables, in particular with the W boson mass and $T$ parameter. Here we\nexplore a scenario with the light singlet (and bino-singlino) state in which\nthe second-lightest scalar takes the role of the SM-like boson with mass close\nto 125 GeV. In such a case the second-lightest Higgs state gets pushed up via\nmixing already at tree-level and thereby reducing the required loop correction.\nUnlike in the NMSSM, the light singlet is necessarily connected with a light\nneutralino which naturally appears as a promising dark matter candidate. We\nshow that dark matter and LHC searches place further bounds on this scenario\nand point out parameter regions, which are viable and of interest for LHC Run\nII and upcoming dark matter experiments.\n", "  Here, we investigate the following key prediction of a thermodynamical model\nthat interrelates the defect parameters with the bulk elastic and expansivity\ndata: for various defect processes in a given matrix material, a\nproportionality exists between defect entropies and enthalpies. The\ninvestigation is focused on BaF2 for which ab-initio calculations within\ndensity functional theory and the generalized-gradient approximation have been\nrecently made as far as the formation and migration of intrinsic defects is\nconcerned, as well as for the elastic constants. Four defect processes have\nbeen studied in BaF$_2$: Anion Frenkel formation, fluorine vacancy migration,\nfluorine interstitial motion and electrical relaxation associated with a single\ntetravalent uranium. For these processes, the entropies and enthalpies vary by\nalmost two orders of magnitude and reveal a proportionality between them. We\nfind that this proportionality is solely governed by the bulk elasticity and\nexpansivity data, which conforms to the aforementioned thermodynamical model.\n", "  We report on the EMMI Rapid Reaction Task Force meeting 'Resonances in QCD',\nwhich took place at GSI October 12-14, 2015. A group of 26 people met to\ndiscuss the physics of resonances in QCD. The aim of the meeting was defined by\nthe following three key questions:\n  What is needed to understand the physics of resonances in QCD?\n  Where does QCD lead us to expect resonances with exotic quantum numbers?\n  What experimental efforts are required to arrive at a coherent picture?\n  For light mesons and baryons only those with ${\\it up}$, ${\\it down}$ and\n${\\it strange}$ quark content were considered. For heavy-light and heavy-heavy\nmeson systems, those with ${\\it charm}$ quarks were the focus. This document\nsummarizes the discussions by the participants, which in turn led to the\ncoherent conclusions we present here.\n", "  We employ the exponential parametrization of the metric and a \"physical\"\ngauge fixing procedure to write a functional flow equation for the\ngravitational effective average action in an $f(R)$ truncation. The background\nmetric is a four-sphere and the coarse-graining procedure contains three free\nparameters. We look for scaling solutions, i.e. non-Gaussian fixed points for\nthe function $f$. For a discrete set of values of the parameters, we find\nsimple global solutions of quadratic polynomial form. For other values, global\nsolutions can be found numerically. Such solutions can be extended in certain\nregions of parameter space and have two relevant directions. We discuss the\nmerits and the shortcomings of this procedure.\n", "  We study chaos in the classical limit of the matrix quantum mechanical system\ndescribing D0-brane dynamics. We determine a precise value of the largest\nLyapunov exponent, and, with less precision, calculate the entire spectrum of\nLyapunov exponents. We verify that these approach a smooth limit as $N\n\\rightarrow \\infty$. We show that a classical analog of scrambling occurs with\nfast scrambling scaling, $t_* \\sim \\log S$. These results confirm the\nk-locality property of matrix mechanics discussed by Sekino and Susskind.\n", "  There is significant evidence for a duality between (non-supersymmetric) U(N)\nChern-Simons theories at level k coupled to fermions, and U(k) Chern-Simons\ntheories at level N coupled to scalars. Most of the evidence comes from the\nlarge N 't Hooft limit, where many details of the duality (such as whether the\ngauge group is U(N) or SU(N), the precise level of the U(1) factor, and order\none shifts in the level) are not important. The main evidence for the validity\nof the duality at finite N comes from adding masses and flowing to pure\nChern-Simons theories related by level-rank duality, and from flowing to the\nnon-supersymmetric duality from supersymmetric dualities, whose finite N\nvalidity is well-established. In this note we clarify the implications of these\nflows for the precise form of the duality; in particular we argue that in its\nsimplest form the duality maps SU(N) theories to U(k) theories, though there is\nalso another version relating U(N) to U(k). This precise form strongly affects\nthe mapping under the duality of baryon and monopole operators, and we show,\nfollowing arguments by Radicevic, that their mapping is consistent with our\nclaims. We also discuss the implications of our results for the additional\nduality between these Chern-Simons matter theories and (the UV completion of)\nhigh-spin gravity theories on AdS_4. The latter theories should contain heavy\nparticles carrying electric and/or magnetic charges under their U(1) gauge\nsymmetry.\n", "  A propagating \"beam\" triggering a local phase transition in a nematic\nelastomer sets it into a crawling motion, which may morph due to buckling. We\nconsider the motion of the various configurations of slender rods and thin\nstripes with both uniform and splayed nematic order in cross-section, and\ndetect the dependence of the gait and speed on flexural rigidity and substrate\nfriction.\n", "  We proceed to study Yang-Baxter deformations of 4D Minkowski spacetime based\non a conformal embedding. We first revisit a Melvin background and argue a Lax\npair by adopting a simple replacement law invented in 1509.00173. This argument\nenables us to deduce a general expression of Lax pair. Then the anticipated Lax\npair is shown to work for arbitrary classical $r$-matrices with Poinca\\'e\ngenerators. As other examples, we present Lax pairs for pp-wave backgrounds,\nthe Hashimoto-Sethi background, the Spradlin-Takayanagi-Volovich background.\n", "  Recently, an interesting inflationary scenario, named Gauss-Bonnet inflation,\nis proposed by Kanti et al.~\\cite{Kanti:2015pda,Kanti:2015dra}. In the model,\nthere is no inflaton potential but the inflaton couples to the Guass-Bonnet\nterm. In the case of quadratic coupling, they find inflation occurs with\ngraceful exit. The scenario is attractive because of the natural set-up.\nHowever, we show there exists the gradient instability in the tensor\nperturbations in this inflationary model. We further prove the no-go theorem\nfor the Gauss-Bonnet inflation without an inflaton potential.\n", "  In models with an extra $\\text{SU}(2)_R$ gauge group and an extended scalar\nsector, the cascade decays of the $W'$ boson can provide various multiboson\nsignals. In particular, diboson decays $W' \\to WZ$ can be suppressed while $W'\n\\to WZX$, with $X$ one of the scalars present in the model, can reach branching\nratios around 4%. We discuss these multiboson signals focusing on possible\ninterpretations of the ATLAS excess in fat jet pair production.\n", "  We introduce and explore new heavy Higgs scenarios in the Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) with explicit CP violation, which have\nimportant phenomenological implications that may be testable at the LHC. For\nsoft supersymmetry-breaking scales M_S above a few TeV and a charged Higgs\nboson mass M_H+ above a few hundred GeV, new physics effects including those\nfrom explicit CP violation decouple from the light Higgs boson sector. However,\nsuch effects can significantly alter the phenomenology of the heavy Higgs\nbosons while still being consistent with constraints from low-energy\nobservables, for instance electric dipole moments. To consider scenarios with a\ncharged Higgs boson much heavier than the Standard Model (SM) particles but\nmuch lighter than the supersymmetric particles, we revisit previous\ncalculations of the MSSM Higgs sector. We compute the Higgs boson masses in the\npresence of CP violating phases, implementing improved matching and\nrenormalization group (RG) effects, as well as two-loop RG effects from the\neffective two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) scale M_H+ to the scale M_S. We\nillustrate the possibility of non-decoupling CP-violating effects in the heavy\nHiggs sector using new benchmark scenarios named CPX4LHC.\n", "  White dwarfs (WDs) are the most promising captors of dark matter (DM)\nparticles in the crests that are expected to build up in the cores of dense\nstellar clusters. The DM particles could reach sufficient densities in WD cores\nto liberate energy through self-annihilation. The extinction associated with\nour Galactic Centre, the most promising region where to look for such effects,\nmakes it impossible to detect the potential associated luminosity of the\nDM-burning WDs. However, in smaller stellar systems which are close enough to\nus and not heavily extincted, such as $\\omega-$Cen, we may be able to detect\nDM-burning WDs. We investigate the prospects of detection of DM-burning WDs in\na stellar cluster harbouring an IMBH, which leads to higher densities of DM at\nthe centre as compared with clusters without one. We calculate the capture rate\nof WIMPs by a WD around an IMBH and estimate the luminosity that a WD would\nemit depending on its distance to the center of the cluster. Direct-summation\n$N-$body simulations of $\\omega-$Cen yield a non-negligible number of WDs in\nthe range of radii of interest. We apply our assumption to published HST/ACS\nobservations of stars in the center of $\\omega-$Cen to search for DM burning\nWDs and, although we are not able to identify any evident candidate because of\ncrowding and incompleteness, we proof that their bunching up at high\nluminosities would be unique. We predict that DM burning will lead to a\ntruncation of the cooling sequence at the faint end. The detection of DM\nburning in future observations of dense stellar clusters, such as globular\nclusters or ultra-compact dwarf galaxies could allow us to probe different\nmodels of DM distributions and characteristics such as the DM particle\nscattering cross section on nucleons. On the other hand, if DM-burning WDs\nreally exist, their number and properties could give hints to the existence of\nIMBHs.\n", "  We construct inflationary models in the context of supergravity with\northogonal nilpotent superfields [1]. When local supersymmetry is gauge-fixed\nin the unitary gauge, these models describe theories with only a single real\nscalar (the inflaton), a graviton and a gravitino. Critically, there is no\ninflatino, no sgoldstino, and no sinflaton in these models. This dramatically\nsimplifies cosmological models which can simultaneously describe inflation,\ndark energy and SUSY breaking.\n", "  We propose inducing Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons in a magnetic\ninsulator by a heat flow oriented toward its boundary. At a critical heat flux,\nthe oversaturated thermal gas of magnons accumulated at the boundary\nprecipitates the condensate, which then grows gradually as the thermal bias is\ndialed up further. The thermal magnons thus pumped by the magnonic bulk (spin)\nSeebeck effect must generally overcome both the local Gilbert damping\nassociated with the coherent magnetic dynamics as well as the radiative\nspin-wave losses toward the magnetic bulk, in order to achieve the threshold of\ncondensation. We quantitatively estimate the requisite bias in the case of the\nferrimagnetic yttrium iron garnet, discuss different physical regimes of\ncondensation, and contrast it with the competing (so-called Doppler-shift) bulk\ninstability.\n", "  We report the results of magnetization and specific heat measurements of\nBa$_2$CoTeO$_6$ composed of two subsystems A and B, which are magnetically\ndescribed as an $S\\,{=}\\,1/2$ triangular-lattice Heisenberg-like\nantiferromagnet and a $J_1-J_2$ honeycomb-lattice Ising-like antiferromagnet,\nrespectively. These two subsystems were found to be approximately decoupled.\nBa$_2$CoTeO$_6$ undergoes magnetic phase transitions at $T_{\\rm N1}\\,{=}\\,12.0$\nK and $T_{\\rm N2}\\,{=}\\,3.0$ K, which can be interpreted as the orderings of\nsubsystems B and A, respectively. Subsystem A exhibits a magnetization plateau\nat one-third of the saturation magnetization for the magnetic field $H$\nperpendicular to the $c$ axis owing to the quantum order-by-disorder, whereas\nfor $H\\,{\\parallel}\\,c$, subsystem B shows three-step metamagnetic transitions\nwith magnetization plateaus at zero, one-third and one-half of the saturation\nmagnetization. The analysis of the magnetization process for subsystem B shows\nthat the classical ground states at these plateaus are infinitely degenerate\nwithin the Ising model.\n", "  During the first few days after explosion, Type II supernovae (SNe) are\ndominated by relatively simple physics. Theoretical predictions regarding\nearly-time SN light curves in the ultraviolet (UV) and optical bands are thus\nquite robust. We present, for the first time, a sample of $57$ $R$-band Type II\nSN light curves that are well monitored during their rise, having $>5$\ndetections during the first 10 days after discovery, and a well-constrained\ntime of explosion to within $1-3$ days. We show that the energy per unit mass\n($E/M$) can be deduced to roughly a factor of five by comparing early-time\noptical data to the model of Rabinak & Waxman (2011), while the progenitor\nradius cannot be determined based on $R$-band data alone. We find that Type II\nSN explosion energies span a range of $E/M=(0.2-20)\\times 10^{51} \\;\n\\rm{erg/(10 M}_\\odot$), and have a mean energy per unit mass of $\\left\\langle\nE/M \\right\\rangle = 0.85\\times 10^{51} \\; \\rm{erg/(10 M}_\\odot$), corrected for\nMalmquist bias. Assuming a small spread in progenitor masses, this indicates a\nlarge intrinsic diversity in explosion energy. Moreover, $E/M$ is positively\ncorrelated with the amount of $^{56}\\rm{Ni}$ produced in the explosion, as\npredicted by some recent models of core-collapse SNe. We further present\nseveral empirical correlations. The peak magnitude is correlated with the\ndecline rate ($\\Delta m_{15}$), the decline rate is weakly correlated with the\nrise time, and the rise time is not significantly correlated with the peak\nmagnitude. Faster declining SNe are more luminous and have longer rise times.\nThis limits the possible power sources for such events.\n", "  We consider the large $N$ interacting vector $O(N)$ model on a sphere in\n$4-\\epsilon$ Euclidean dimensions. The Gaussian theory in the UV is taken to be\neither conformally or non-conformally coupled. The endpoint of the RG flow\ncorresponds to a conformally coupled scalar field at the Wilson-Fisher fixed\npoint. We take a spherical entangling surface in de Sitter space and compute\nthe entanglement entropy everywhere along the RG trajectory. In $4$ dimensions,\na free non-conformal scalar has a universal area term scaling with the\nlogarithm of the UV cutoff. In $4-\\epsilon$ dimensions, such a term scales as\n$1/\\epsilon$. For a non-conformal scalar, a $1/\\epsilon$ term is present both\nat the UV fixed point, and its vicinity. For flow between two conformal fixed\npoints, $1/\\epsilon$ terms are absent everywhere. Finally, we make contact with\nreplica trick calculations. The conical singularity gives rise to boundary\nterms residing on the entangling surface, which are usually discarded.\nConsistency with our results requires they be kept. We argue that, in fact,\nthis conclusion also follows from the work of Metlitski, Fuertes, and Sachdev,\nwhich demonstrated that such boundary terms will be generated through quantum\ncorrections.\n", "  We extend our analysis of the soft behaviour of string amplitudes with\nmassive insertions to closed strings at tree level (sphere). Relying on our\nprevious results for open strings on the disk and on KLT formulae we check\nuniversality of the soft behaviour for gravitons to sub-leading order for\nsuperstring amplitudes and show how this gets modified for bosonic strings. At\nsub-sub-leading order we argue in favour of universality for superstrings on\nthe basis of OPE of the vertex operators and gauge invariance for the soft\ngraviton. The results are illustrated by explicit examples of 4-point\namplitudes with one massive insertion in any dimension, including D=4, where\nuse of the helicity spinor formalism drastically simplifies the expressions. As\na by-product of our analysis we confirm that the `single valued projection'\nholds for massive amplitudes, too. We briefly comment on the soft behaviour of\nthe anti-symmetric tensor and on loop corrections.\n", "  We study the strong coupling behaviour of $1/4$-BPS circular Wilson loops (a\nfamily of \"latitudes\") in ${\\cal N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills theory, computing the\none-loop corrections to the relevant classical string solutions in\nAdS$_5\\times$S$^5$. Supersymmetric localization provides an exact result that,\nin the large 't Hooft coupling limit, should be reproduced by the sigma-model\napproach. To avoid ambiguities due to the absolute normalization of the string\npartition function, we compare the $ratio$ between the generic latitude and the\nmaximal 1/2-BPS circle: Any measure-related ambiguity should simply cancel in\nthis way. We use Gel'fand-Yaglom method to calculate the relevant functional\ndeterminants, that present some complications with respect to the standard\ncircular case. After a careful numerical evaluation of our final expression we\nstill find disagreement with the localization answer: The difference is encoded\ninto a precise \"remainder function\". We comment on the possible origin and\nresolution of this discordance.\n", "  Determinations of the shear viscosity of trapped ultracold gases suffer from\nsystematic, uncontrolled uncertainties related to the treatment of the dilute\npart of the gas cloud. In this work we present an analysis of expansion\nexperiments based on a new method, anisotropic fluid dynamics, that\ninterpolates between Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics at the center of the cloud\nand ballistic behavior in the dilute corona. We validate the method using a\ncomparison between anisotropic fluid dynamics and numerical solutions of the\nBoltzmann equation. We then apply anisotropic fluid dynamics to the expansion\ndata reported by Cao et al. In the high temperature limit we find\n$\\eta=0.282(mT)^{3/2}$, which agrees within about 5\\% with the theoretical\nprediction $\\eta=0.269(mT)^{3/2}$.\n", "  Non-Abelian family symmetries offer a very promising explanation for the\nflavour structure in the Standard Model and its extensions. We explore the\npossibility that dark matter consists in fermions that transform under a family\nsymmetry, such that the visible and dark sector are linked by the familons -\nStandard Model gauge singlet scalars, responsible for spontaneously breaking\nthe family symmetry. We study three representative models with non-Abelian\nfamily symmetries that have been shown capable to explain the masses and mixing\nof the Standard Model fermions. One of our central results is the possibility\nto have dark matter fermions and at least one familon with masses on and even\nbelow the experimentally accessible TeV scale. In particular we discuss the\ncharacteristic signatures in collider experiments from light familon Fields\nwith a non-Abelian family symmetry, and we show that run I of the LHC is\nalready testing this class of models.\n", "  We study charm production in Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=$2.76 TeV\nin the Parton-Hadron-String-Dynamics transport approach and the charm dynamics\nin the partonic and hadronic medium. The charm quarks are produced through\ninitial binary nucleon-nucleon collisions by using the PYTHIA event generator\ntaking into account the (anti-)shadowing incorporated in the EPS09 package. The\nproduced charm quarks interact with off-shell massive partons in the\nquark-gluon plasma and are hadronized into $D$ mesons through coalescence or\nfragmentation close to the critical energy density, and then interact with\nhadrons in the final hadronic stage with scattering cross sections calculated\nin an effective Lagrangian approach with heavy-quark spin symmetry. The PHSD\nresults show a reasonable $R_{\\rm AA}$ and elliptic flow of $D$ mesons in\ncomparison to the experimental data for Pb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =\n2.76 TeV from the ALICE Collaboration. We also study the effect of\ntemperature-dependent off-shell charm quarks in relativistic heavy-ion\ncollisions. We find that the scattering cross sections are only moderately\naffected by off-shell charm degrees of freedom. However, the position of the\npeak of $R_{\\rm AA}$ for $D$ mesons depends on the strength of the scalar\npartonic forces which also have an impact on the $D$ meson elliptic flow. The\ncomparison with experimental data on the $R_{\\rm AA}$ suggests that the\nrepulsive force is weaker for off-shell charm quarks as compared to that for\nlight quarks. Furthermore, the effects from radiative charm energy loss appear\nto be low compared to the collisional energy loss up to transverse momenta of\n$\\sim$ 15 GeV/c.\n", "  Armchair biphenylene nanoribbons are investigated by using density functional\ntheory. The nanoribbon that contains one biphenylene subunit in a unit cell is\na semiconductor with a direct band gap larger than 1 eV, while that containing\nfour biphenylene subunits is a metal. The semiconducting nanoribbon has high\nelectron mobility of 57174 cm2V-1s-1, superior to armchair graphene\nnanoribbons. Negative differential resistance behavior is observed in two\nelectronic devices composed of the semiconducting and metallic nanoribbons. The\non/off ratios are in the order of 10^3. All these indicate that armchair\nbiphenylene nanoribbons are potential candidates for ultra-small logic devices.\n", "  Neurites, the long cellular protrusions that form the routes of the neuronal\nnetwork are capable to actively extend during early morphogenesis or to\nregenerate after trauma. To perform this task, they rely on their cytoskeleton\nfor mechanical support. In this paper, we present a three-component active gel\nmodel that describes neurites in the three robust mechanical states observed\nexperimentally: collapsed, static, and motile. These states arise from an\ninterplay between the physical forces driven by growth of the microtubule-rich\ninner core of the neurite and the acto-myosin contractility of its surrounding\ncortical membrane. In particular, static states appear as a mechanical\ntraction/compression balance of these two parallel structures. The model\npredicts how the response of a neurite to a towing force depends on the force\nmagnitude and recovers the response of neurites to several drug treatments that\nmodulate the cytoskeleton active and passive properties.\n", "  Established populations often exhibit oscillations in their sizes. If a\npopulation is isolated, intrinsic stochasticity of elemental processes can\nultimately bring it to extinction. Here we study extinction of oscillating\npopulations in a stochastic version of the Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey\nmodel. To this end we extend a WKB approximation (after Wentzel, Kramers and\nBrillouin) of solving the master equation to the case of extinction from a\nlimit cycle in the space of population sizes. We evaluate the extinction rates\nand find the most probable paths to extinction by applying Floquet theory to\nthe dynamics of an effective WKB Hamiltonian. We show that the entropic\nbarriers to extinction change in a non-analytic way as the system passes\nthrough the Hopf bifurcation. We also study the subleading pre-exponential\nfactors of the WKB approximation.\n", "  We apply the differential equation technique to the calculation of the\none-loop massless diagram with five onshell legs. Using the reduction to\n$\\epsilon$-form, we manage to obtain a simple one-fold integral representation\nexact in space-time dimensionality. The expansion of the obtained result in\n$\\epsilon$ and the analytical continuation to physical regions are discussed.\n", "  We searched for an X-ray line at energies around 3.5 keV in deep, ~1.6 Msec\nXMM-Newton observations of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Draco. No line was found\nin either the MOS or the PN detectors. The data in this energy range are\ncompletely consistent with a single, unfolded power law modeling the particle\nbackground, which dominates at these energies, plus instrumental lines; the\naddition of a ~3.5 keV line feature gives no improvement to the fit. The\ncorresponding upper limit on the line flux rules out a dark matter decay origin\nfor the 3.5 keV line found in observations of clusters of galaxies and in the\nGalactic Center at greater than 99% C.L..\n", "  More than two decades ago, we studied heavy-flavor-conserving weak decays of\nheavy baryons within the framework that incorporates both heavy-quark and\nchiral symmetries. In view of the first observation of\n$\\Xi_b^-\\to\\Lambda_b^0\\pi^-$ by LHCb recently, we have reexamined these decays\nand presented updated predictions. The predicted rates for\n$\\Xi_b^-\\to\\Lambda_b^0\\pi^-$ in the MIT bag and diquark models are consistent\nwith experiment. The major theoretical uncertainty stems from the evaluation of\nbaryon matrix elements. The branching fraction of $\\Xi_c\\to\\Lambda_c\\pi$ is\npredicted to be of order $10^{-4}$. It is suppressed relative to\n$Br(\\Xi_b\\to\\Lambda_b\\pi)$ owing to the shorter lifetime of $\\Xi_c$ relative to\n$\\Xi_b$ and the destructive nonspectator $W$-exchange contribution. The\nkinematically accessible weak decays of the sextet heavy baryon $\\Omega_Q$ are\n$\\Omega_Q\\to\\Xi_Q\\pi$. Due to the absence of the $B_6-B_{\\bar 3}$ transition in\nthe heavy quark limit and the $B_6-B_6$ transition in the model calculations,\n$\\Omega_Q\\to\\Xi_Q\\pi$ vanish in the heavy quark limit.\n", "  We model and simulate the performance of charge-transfer in nonphotochemical\nquenching (NPQ) in the CP29 light-harvesting antenna-complex associated with\nphotosystem II (PSII). The model consists of five discrete excitonic energy\nstates and two sinks, responsible for the potentially damaging processes and\ncharge-transfer channels, respectively. We demonstrate that by varying (i) the\nparameters of the chlorophyll-based dimer, (ii) the resonant properties of the\nprotein-solvent environment interaction, and (iii) the energy transfer rates to\nthe sinks, one can significantly improve the performance of the NPQ. Our\nanalysis suggests strategies for improving the performance of the NPQ in\nresponse to environmental changes, and may stimulate experimental verification.\n", "  We consider an open string stretched between a Y=0 brane and a Y_theta=0\nbrane. The latter brane is rotated with respect to the former by an angle\ntheta, and is described by a non-diagonal boundary S-matrix. This system\ninterpolates smoothly between the Y-Y (theta =0) and the Y-bar Y (theta = pi/2)\nsystems, which are described by diagonal boundary S-matrices. We use\nintegrability to compute the energies of one-particle states at weak coupling\nup to leading wrapping order (4, 6 loops) as a function of the angle. The\nresults for the diagonal cases exactly match with those obtained previously.\n", "  To examine the thermodynamic properties of\nPr$_{2}$Ba$_{4}$Cu$_{7}$O$_{15-\\delta }$ compounds with metallic CuO double\nchains, we measured the specific heats of superconducting and\nnon-superconducting polycrystalline samples at low temperatures (1.8-40 K)\nunder various magnetic fields (up to 9 T). In the as-sintered\nnon-superconducting sample, a $\\lambda-$like enhancement in the specific heat\nmeasurement appeared near the antiferromagnetic transition temperature\n$T_{N}=17$ K. In contrast, the reduced superconducting sample with\n$T_{c,on}=26.5$ K exhibited no obvious superconducting anomaly in its specific\ndata, but a Schottky-like broad maximum appeared at low temperatures. The\nSchottky-like anomaly was attributed to low-lying quasi-triplet splitting of\nPr$^{3+}$ ions under the crystal field effect.\n", "  $B_c$ production rate in Higgs boson decays is evaluated in NRQCD framework.\nGiven Higgs total decay width is about $4.20~MeV$ and the vector $B^*_c$ meson\ndecays completely to the ground state, we find that the branching fraction of\n$B_c$ meson production in Higgs decays is $8.50\\times10^{-4}$, where both\nleading QED and QCD contributions are included. This process is hence\ndetectable in the high-luminosity/energy LHC. In confronting to the quarkonia\nproduction, we find that the fraction rate of $B_c$ production is more than an\norder of magnitude bigger than those of charmonium and bottomoium production in\nHiggs decays. In the calculation, various differential distributions and\nuncertainties of the concerned processes are analysed.\n", "  By quantum Monte Carlo simulations of bosons in gapped honeycomb lattices, we\nshow the existence of bosonic edge states. For single layer honeycomb lattice,\nbosonic edge states can be controlled to appear, cross the gap and merge into\nbulk states by an on-site potential applied on the outmost sites of the\nboundary. On bilayer honeycomb lattice, bosonic edge state traversing the gap\nat half filling is demonstrated. The topological origin of the bosonic edge\nstates is discussed with pseudo Berry curvature. The results will simulate\nexperimental studies of these exotic bosonic edge states with ultracold bosons\ntrapped in honeycomb optical lattices.\n", "  For a plasma in a stationary homogeneous turbulence, the Fokker-Planck\nequation is derived from the nonlinear Vlasov equation by introducing the\nentropy principle. The ensemble average in evaluating the kinetic diffusion\ntensor, whose symmetry has been proved, can be computed in a straightforward\nway when the fluctuating particle trajectories are provided. As an application,\nit has been shown that a mean electric filed can drive a particle flux through\nthe Stokes-Einstein relation, independent of the details of turbulence.\n", "  For the case of two particles a solution of the string field theory vertex\naxioms can be factorized into a standard form factor and a kinematical piece\nwhich includes the dependence on the size of the third string. In this paper we\nconstruct an exact solution of the kinematical axioms for AdS5xS5 which\nincludes all order wrapping corrections w.r.t. the size of the third string.\nThis solution is expressed in terms of elliptic Gamma functions and ordinary\nelliptic functions. The solution is valid at any coupling and we analyze its\nweak coupling, pp-wave and large L limit.\n", "  We argue that non-perturbative $\\alpha'$ stringy effects render the\nHartle-Hawking state associated with the $SL(2)/U(1)$ eternal black hole\nsingular at the horizon. We discuss implications of this observation on\nfirewalls in string theory.\n", "  Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been often considered as the\nnatural evolution of some core-collapse supernovae (SNe). While GRBs with\nrelativistic jets emit an electromagnetic signal, GRBs with mildly relativistic\njets are opaque to photons and, therefore, could be detectable through\nneutrinos only. We discuss the possibility that successful GRBs and mildly\nrelativistic jets belong to the same class of astrophysical transients with\ndifferent Lorentz factor Gamma_b and study the production of high-energy\nneutrinos as a function of Gamma_b, by including both proton-photon and\nproton-proton interactions. By assuming a SN-GRB connection, we find that the\ndiffuse neutrino emission from optically thick jets with Lorentz factors lower\nthan the ones of successful GRBs can be one of the main components of the\nobserved IceCube high-energy neutrino flux. Moreover, under the assumption that\nall these jets belong to the same class of astrophysical transients, we show\nthat the IceCube high-energy neutrino data provide indirect constraints on the\nrate of non-successful jets, favoring a local rate lower than tens of percent\nof the local SN rate. These limits are currently comparable to the ones\nobtained in dedicated searches on choked sources and are expected to become\ntighter with accumulation of more high-energy neutrino data.\n", "  The collection of a few anomalies in semileptonic $B$-decays invites to\nspeculate about the emergence of some strikingly new phenomena. Here we offer a\npossible interpretation of these anomalies in the context of a weakly broken\n$U(2)^5$ flavour symmetry and lepto-quark mediators.\n", "  In this paper we study geodesic motion around a distorted Schwarzschild black\nhole. We consider both timelike and null geodesics which are confined to the\nblack hole's equatorial plane. Such geodesics generically exist if the\ndistortion field has only even interior multipole moments and so the field is\nsymmetric with respect to the equatorial plane. We specialize to the case of\ndistortions defined by a quadrupole Weyl moment. An analysis of the effective\npotential for equatorial timelike geodesics shows that finite stable orbits\noutside the black hole are possible only for $q\\in(q_{\\text{min}},\nq_{\\text{max}}]$, where $q_{\\text{min}}\\approx-0.0210$ and\n$q_{\\text{max}}\\approx2.7086\\times10^{-4}$, while for null equatorial geodesics\na finite stable orbit outside the black hole is possible only for\n$q\\in[q_{\\text{min}},0)$. Moreover, the innermost stable circular orbits\n(ISCOs) are closer to the distorted black hole horizon than those of an\nundistorted Schwarzschild black hole for $q\\in(q_{\\text{min}},0)$ and a null\nISCO exists for $q=q_{\\text{min}}$. These results shows that an external\ndistortion of a negative and sufficiently small quadrupole moment tends to\nstabilize motion of massive particles and light.\n", "  The asymptotic structure of AdS spacetimes in the context of General\nRelativity coupled to the Maxwell field in three spacetime dimensions is\nanalyzed. Although the fall-off of the fields is relaxed with respect to that\nof Brown and Henneaux, the variation of the canonical generators associated to\nthe asymptotic Killing vectors can be shown to be finite once required to span\nthe Lie derivative of the fields. The corresponding surface integrals then\nacquire explicit contributions from the electromagnetic field, and become\nwell-defined provided they fulfill suitable integrability conditions, implying\nthat the leading terms of the asymptotic form of the electromagnetic field are\nfunctionally related. Consequently, for a generic choice of boundary\nconditions, the asymptotic symmetries are broken down to $\\mathbb{R}\\otimes\nU\\left(1\\right)\\otimes U\\left(1\\right)$. Nonetheless, requiring compatibility\nof the boundary conditions with one of the asymptotic Virasoro symmetries,\nsingles out the set to be characterized by an arbitrary function of a single\nvariable, whose precise form depends on the choice of the chiral copy.\nRemarkably, requiring the asymptotic symmetries to contain the full conformal\ngroup selects a very special set of boundary conditions that is labeled by a\nunique constant parameter, so that the algebra of the canonical generators is\ngiven by the direct sum of two copies of the Virasoro algebra with the standard\ncentral extension and $U\\left(1\\right)$. This special set of boundary\nconditions makes the energy spectrum of electrically charged rotating black\nholes to be well-behaved.\n", "  The GD-1 star stream is currently the best available for identifying density\nfluctuations, \"gaps\", along its length as a test of the LCDM prediction of\nlarge numbers of dark matter sub-halos orbiting in the halo. Density variations\nof some form are present, since the variance of the density along the stream is\nthree times that expected from the empirically estimated variation in the\nfiltered mean star counts. The density variations are characterized with\nfilters that approximate the shape of sub-halo gravitationally induced stream\ngaps. The filters locate gaps and measures their amplitude, leading to a\nmeasurement of the distribution of gap widths. To gain understanding of the\nfactors influencing the gap width distribution, a suite of collisionless n-body\nsimulations for a GD-1 like orbit in a Milky Way-like potential provides a\ndynamically realistic statistical prediction of the gap distribution. The\nsimulations show that every location in the stream has been disturbed to some\ndegree by a sub-halo. The small gaps found via the filtering are largely noise.\nLarger gaps, those longer than 1 kpc, or 10 degrees for GD-1, are the source of\nthe excess variance. The suite of stream simulations shows that sub-halos at\nthe predicted inner halo abundance or possibly somewhat higher can produce the\nrequired large sale density variations.\n", "  By neglecting the self-force, self-energy, and radiative effects, it has been\nshown that an extremal or near-extremal Kerr-Newman black hole can turn into a\nnaked singularity when it captures charged and spinning massive particles. A\nstraightforward question then arises: do charged and rotating black holes in\nstring theory possess the same property? In this paper we apply the Wald's\ngedanken experiment, in his study on the possibility of destroying extremal\nKerr-Newman black holes, to the case of (near-)extremal Kerr-Sen black holes.\nWe find that feeding a test particle into a (near-)extremal Kerr-Sen black hole\ncould lead to a violation of the extremal bound for the black hole.\n", "  A combination of block-Jacobi and deflation preconditioning is used to solve\na high-order discontinuous collocation-based discretization of the Schur\ncomplement of the Poisson-Neumann system as arises in the operator splitting of\nthe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The preconditioners and deflation\nvectors are chosen to mitigate the effects of ill-conditioning due to\nhighly-elongated domains and to achieve GMRES convergence independent of the\nsize of the grid. The ill-posedness of the Poisson-Neumann system manifests as\nan inconsistency of the Schur complement problem, but it is shown that this can\nbe accounted for with appropriate projections out of the null space of the\nSchur matrix without affecting the accuracy of the solution. The combined\ndeflation/block-Jacobi preconditioning is compared with two-level\nnon-overlapping additive Schwarz preconditioning of the Schur problem, and\nwhile both methods achieve convergence independent of the grid size, deflation\nis shown to require half as many GMRES iterations and $25\\%$ less wall-clock\ntime for a variety of grid sizes and domain aspect ratios. The deflation\nmethods shown to be effective for the two-dimensional Poisson-Neumann problem\nare extensible to the three-dimensional problem assuming a Fourier\ndiscretization in the third dimension.\n", "  Highly-ordered and spatially-coherent cobalt slanted columnar thin films were\ndeposited by glancing angle deposition onto silicon substrates, and\nsubsequently oxidized by annealing at 475 $^{\\circ}$C. Scanning electron\nmicroscopy, Raman scattering, generalized ellipsometry, and density functional\ntheory investigations reveal shape-invariant transformation of the slanted\nnanocolumns from metallic to transparent metal-oxide core-shell structures with\nproperties characteristic of spinel cobalt oxide. We find passivation of\nCo-SCTFs yielding CoAl$_2$O$_3$ core-shell structures produced by conformal\ndeposition of a few nanometers of alumina using atomic layer deposition fully\nprevents cobalt oxidation in ambient and from annealing up to 475 $^{\\circ}$C.\n", "  In this work, we have investigated the domain wall (DW) depinning behavior in\nthe notched nanowire by a micromagnetic simulation. A transverse domain wall\n(TW) was initially positioned at the center of notch and 1 ns length current\npulse was applied to depin the DW with respect to the notch size s and the wire\nwidth variation. We have observed the depinning current density Jd which was a\nminimum current to escape DW from the notch. It was found that the depinning\ncurrent density decreased as the wire width and the notch size increased. In\nthe depinning process, we observed the inner structure of DW generally\ntransformed from TW to anti-vortex wall (AVW). Interestingly, for the case of s\nless than 70 nm, AVW formed and depinned closely to the period when current\npulse was active, while for s larger than 70 nm, AVW formed until the current\npulse went to zero and then depinned after flipped TW was formed. It can be\nexplained that the transformation of DW inner structures were affected by the\nspin torque energy and contributed to DW depinning behavior from the notched\nnanowires.\n", "  Electroweak baryogenesis is a simple and attractive candidate mechanism for\ngenerating the observed baryon asymmetry in the Universe. Its viability is\nsometimes investigated in terms of an effective field theory of the Standard\nModel involving higher dimension operators. We investigate the validity of such\nan effective field theory approach to the problem of identifying electroweak\nphase transitions strong enough for electroweak baryogenesis to be successful.\nWe identify and discuss some pitfalls of this approach due to the modest\nhierarchy between mass scales of heavy degrees or freedom and the Higgs, and\nthe possibility of dimensionful couplings violating the decoupling between\nlight and heavy degrees of freedom.\n", "  We study here a very popular 1D jump model introduced by Kac: it consists of\n$N$ velocities encountering random binary collisions at which they randomly\nexchange energy. We show the uniform (in $N$) exponential contractivity of the\ndynamics in a non-standard Monge-Kantorovich-Wasserstein: precisely the MKW\nmetric of order 2 on the energy. The result is optimal in the sense that for\neach $N$, the contractivity constant is equal to the $L^2$ spectral gap of the\ngenerator associated to Kac's dynamic. As a corollary, we get an uniform but\nnon optimal contractivity in the MKW metric of order $4$. We use a simple\ncoupling that works better that the parallel one. The estimates are simple and\nnew (to the best of our knowledge).\n", "  A method for calculating phase-space master integrals for the decay process\n$1 \\to n$ massless partons in QCD using integration-by-parts and differential\nequations techniques is discussed. The method is based on the appropriate\nchoice of the basis for master integrals which leads to significant\nsimplification of differential equations. We describe an algorithm how to\nconstruct the desirable basis, so that the resulting system of differential\nequations can be recursively solved in terms of (G)HPLs as a series in the\ndimensional regulator $\\epsilon$ to any order. We demonstrate its power by\ncalculating master integrals for the NLO time-like splitting functions and\ndiscuss future applications of the proposed method at the NNLO precision.\n", "  Intermolecular correlations in liquid water at ambient conditions have\ngenerally been characterized through short range density fluctuations described\nthrough the atomic pair distribution functions (PDF). Recent numerical and\nexperimental results have suggested that such a description of order or\nstructure in liquid water is incomplete and there exists considerably longer\nranged orientational correlations in water that can be studied through dipolar\ncorrelations. In this study, using large scale classical, atomistic molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations using TIP4P-Ew and TIP3P models of water, we show\nthat salts such as sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride (KCl), caesium\nchloride (CsCl) and magnesium chloride (MgCl$_2$) have a long range effect on\nthe dipolar correlations, which can not be explained by the notion of structure\nmaking and breaking by dissolved ions. The relative effects of cations on\ndipolar correlations are observed to be consistent with the well-known\nHofmeister series. Observed effects are explained through orientational\nstratification of water molecules around ions, and their long range coupling to\nthe global hydrogen bond network by virtue of the sum rule for water. The\nobservations for single hydrophilic solutes are contrasted with the same for a\nsingle methane (CH$_4$) molecule. We observe that even a single small\nhydrophobe can result in enhancement of long range orientational correlations\nin liquid water,- contrary to the case of dissolved ions, which have been\nobserved to have a reducing effect. The observations from this study are\ndiscussed in the context of hydrophobic effect.\n", "  The evolution of network structure and the spreading of epidemic are common\ncoexistent dynamical processes. In most cases, network structure is treated\neither static or time-varying, supposing the whole network is observed in a\nsame time window. In this paper, we consider the epidemic spreading on a\nnetwork consisting of both static and time-varying structures. At meanwhile,\nthe time-varying part and the epidemic spreading are supposed to be of the same\ntime scale. We introduce a static and activity driven coupling (SADC) network\nmodel to characterize the coupling between static (strong) structure and\ndynamic (weak) structure. Epidemic thresholds of SIS and SIR model are studied\non SADC both analytically and numerically with various coupling strategies,\nwhere the strong structure is of homogeneous or heterogeneous degree\ndistribution. Theoretical thresholds obtained from SADC model can both recover\nand generalize the classical results in static and time-varying networks. It is\ndemonstrated that weak structures can make the epidemics break out much more\neasily in homogeneous coupling but harder in heterogeneous coupling when\nkeeping same average degree in SADC networks. Furthermore, we show there exists\na threshold ratio of the weak structure to have substantive effects on the\nbreakout of the epidemics. This promotes our understanding of why epidemics can\nstill break out in some social networks even we restrict the flow of the\npopulation.\n", "  We analyze constrained superfields in supergravity. We investigate the\nconsistency and solve all known constraints, presenting a new class that may\nhave interesting applications in the construction of inflationary models. We\nprovide the superspace Lagrangians for minimal supergravity models based on\nthem and write the corresponding theories in component form using a simplifying\ngauge for the goldstino couplings.\n", "  In this work the exceptional field theory formulation of supergravity with\nSL(5) gauge group is considered. This group appears as a U-duality group of\n$D=7$ maximal supergravity. In the formalism presented the hidden global\nduality group is promoted into a gauge group of a theory in dimensions 7+number\nof extended directions. This work is a continuation of the series of works for\n$E_{8,7,6}, SO(5,5)$ and $SL(3)\\times SL(2)$ duality groups.\n", "  SO(10) grand unification accommodates intermediate gauge symmetries with\nwhich gauge coupling unification can be realized without supersymmetry. In this\npaper, we discuss the possibility that a new massive gauge boson associated\nwith an intermediate gauge symmetry explains the excess observed in the diboson\nresonance search recently reported by the ATLAS experiment. The model we find\nhas two intermediate symmetries, $SU(4)_C \\otimes SU(2)_L \\otimes SU(2)_R$ and\n$SU(3)_C \\otimes SU(2)_L \\otimes SU(2)_R \\otimes U(1)_{B-L}$, where the latter\ngauge group is broken at the TeV scale. This model achieves gauge coupling\nunification with a unification scale sufficiently high to avoid proton decay.\nIn addition, this model provides a good dark matter candidates, whose stability\nis guaranteed by a $Z_2$ symmetry present after the spontaneous breaking of the\nintermediate gauge symmetries. We also discuss prospects for testing these\nmodels in the forthcoming LHC experiments and dark matter detection\nexperiments.\n", "  We provide a compact derivation of the static and dynamic equations for\ninfinite-dimensional particle systems in the liquid and glass phases. The\nstatic derivation is based on the introduction of an \"auxiliary\" disorder and\nthe use of the replica method. The dynamic derivation is based on the general\nanalogy between replicas and the supersymmetric formulation of dynamics. We\nshow that static and dynamic results are consistent, and follow the Random\nFirst Order Transition scenario of mean field disordered glassy systems.\n", "  Perturbative quantization of Yang-Mills theory with a gauge algebra given by\nthe classical double of a semisimple Lie algebra is considered. The classical\ndouble of a real Lie algebra is a nonsemisimple real Lie algebra that admits a\nnonpositive definite invariant metric, the indefiniteness of the metric\nsuggesting an apparent lack of unitarity. It is shown that the theory is UV\ndivergent at one loop and that there are no radiative corrections at higher\nloops. One-loop UV divergences are removed through renormalization of the\ncoupling constant, thus introducing a renormalization scale. The terms in the\nclassical action that would spoil unitarity are proved to be cohomologically\ntrivial with respect to the Slavnov-Taylor operator that controls gauge\ninvariance for the quantum theory. Hence they do not contribute gauge invariant\nradiative corrections to the quantum effective action and the theory is\nunitary.\n", "  We propose a new framework of low-scale gauge-mediated supersymmetry (SUSY)\nbreaking with a gravitino mass of O(100) TeV. The usual 4D gauge mediation\nmodels predict a light gravitino and suffer from cosmological problems. In our\nframework, a heavy gravitino in gauge mediation is realized with a flat\nextra-dimension, whose compactification scale is around the grand unified\ntheory scale. Superparticle masses of the visible sector from gravity/anomaly\nmediation are suppressed, and they are purely generated by usual gauge\nmediation on the visible brane. Importantly, the Higgs Bmu-term vanishes at the\nleading order, which enables us to obtain the suitable mu-Bmu relation for the\nelectroweak symmetry breaking. We discuss such models considering two\npossibilities of the SUSY breaking source: 1) Scherk-Schwarz SUSY breaking\nwhich we call Scherk-Schwarz Gauge Mediation and 2) gravitational SUSY breaking\nlocalized on a hidden brane. In the case 2), the cosmological moduli problem\nmay be relaxed as well.\n", "  The classic method for mass determination in a SUSY-like cascade decay chain\nrelies on measurements of the kinematic endpoints in the invariant mass\ndistributions of suitable collections of visible decay products. However, the\nprocedure is complicated by combinatorial ambiguities: e.g., the visible final\nstate particles may be indistinguishable (as in the case of QCD jets), or one\nmay not know the exact order in which they are emitted along the decay chain.\nIn order to avoid such combinatorial ambiguities, we propose to treat the final\nstate particles fully democratically and consider the sorted set of the\ninvariant masses of all possible partitions of the visible particles in the\ndecay chain. In particular, for a decay to N visible particles, one considers\nthe sorted sets of all possible n-body invariant mass combinations (2 <= n <=\nN) and determines the kinematic endpoint m_(n,r)^max of the distribution of the\nr-th largest n-body invariant mass m_(n,r) for each possible value of n and r.\nFor the classic example of a squark decay in supersymmetry, we provide\nanalytical formulas for the interpretation of these endpoints in terms of the\nunderlying physical masses. We point out that these measurements can be used to\ndetermine the structure of the decay topology, e.g., the number and position of\nintermediate on-shell resonances.\n", "  Searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for neutral, long-lived particles\nhave historically relied on the detection of displaced particles produced by\ntheir decay $\\textit{within}$ the detector volume. In this paper we study the\npotential of the complementary signature comprising of the missing transverse\nenergy ($E_T^{miss}$) signal, traditionally used to look for dark matter, e.g.,\nthe lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), to extend the LHC coverage to\nmodels with long-lived (LL) particles when they decay $\\textit{outside}$ the\ndetector. Using CMS and ATLAS analyses at the 8 TeV LHC, we set an upper limit\nat the 95% confidence level (CL) on the production cross sections for two\nspecific scenarios: (i) a model with a heavy non-standard model Higgs boson\ndecaying to a LL scalar and (ii) an R-parity violating RPV SUSY model with a LL\nneutralino.\n  We show that this method can significantly extend the LHC sensitivity to\nneutral, LL particles with arbitrary large lifetimes and that the limits\nobtained from a $E_T^{miss}$ signal are comparable to those from displaced\nparticle searches for decay distances above a few meters. Results obtained in\nthis study do not not depend on the specific decay channel of the LL particle\nand therefore are model-independent in this sense. We provide limits for the\nwhole two-dimensional plane in terms of the mass of the LL particle and the\nmass of the mediator up to masses of 2 TeV including particular benchmarks\nstudied in the original experimental papers. We have made these limits\navailable in the form of a grid which can be used for the interpretation of\nvarious other new physics models.\n", "  I provide a frequency domain reduced order model (ROM) for the aligned-spin\neffective-one-body (EOB) model \"SEOBNRv2\" for data analysis with second and\nthird generation ground based gravitational wave (GW) detectors. SEOBNRv2\nmodels the dominant mode of the GWs emitted by the coalescence of black hole\n(BH) binaries. The large physical parameter space (dimensionless spins $-1 \\leq\n\\chi_i \\leq 0.99$ and symmetric mass-ratios $0.01 \\leq \\eta \\leq 0.25$)\nrequires sophisticated reduced order modeling techniques, including patching in\nthe parameter space and in frequency. I find that the time window over which\nthe inspiral-plunge and the merger-ringdown waveform in SEOBNRv2 are connected\nis discontinuous when the spin of the deformed Kerr BH $\\chi=0.8$ or the\nsymmetric mass-ratio $\\eta \\sim 0.083$. This discontinuity increases resolution\nrequirements for the ROM. The ROM can be used for compact binary systems with\ntotal masses of $2 M_\\odot$ or higher for the advanced LIGO (aLIGO) design\nsensitivity and a $10$ Hz lower cutoff frequency. The ROM has a worst mismatch\nagainst SEOBNRv2 of $\\sim 1\\%$, but in general mismatches are better than $\\sim\n0.1\\%$. The ROM is crucial for key data analysis applications for compact\nbinaries, such as GW searches and parameter estimation carried out within the\nLIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC).\n", "  The quark-meson coupling model due to Guichon is formulated on the basis of\nthe independent quark model of the nucleon proposed by Bogoliubov and is\napplied to the phenomenological descriptions of symmetric and asymmetric\nnuclear matter. For symmetric matter, the model predicts, at saturation\ndensity, the incompressibility $K=335.17$ MeV, the quark effective mass\n$m_q^*=238.5$ MeV, and the effective nucleon mass $M^*= 0.76 M,$ where $M$ is\nthe nucleon mass in vacuum. Neutron star massesabove two solar masses are\nobtained.\n", "  We describe the optical emission and the carrier dynamics of an ensemble of\nself-assembled GaAs quantum dots embedded in GaP(001). The QD formation is\ndriven by the 3.6 % lattice mismatch between GaAs and GaP in Stranski-Krastanow\nmode after deposition of more than 1.2 monolayers of GaAs. The quantum dots\nhave an areal density between 6 and 7.6x1010 per cm-2 and multimodal size\ndistribution. The luminescence spectra show two peaks in the range of 1.7 and\n2.1 eV. The samples with larger quantum dots have red emission and show less\nthermal quenching compared to the samples with smaller QDs. The large QDs\nluminescence up to room temperature. We attribute the high energy emission to\nindirect carrier recombination in the thin quantum wells or small strained\nquantum dots, whereas the low energy red emission is due to the direct\nelectron-hole recombination in the relaxed quantum dots.\n", "  We develop a dynamical approach to study the Casimir-Polder force between a\ninitially bare molecule and a magnetodielectric body at finite temperature.\nSwitching on the interaction between the molecule and the field at a particular\ntime, we study the resulting temporal evolution of the Casimir-Polder\ninteraction. The dynamical self-dressing of the molecule and its\npopulation-induced dynamics are accounted for and discussed. In particular, we\nfind that the Casimir-Polder force between a chiral molecule and a perfect\nmirror oscillates in time with a frequency related to the molecular transition\nfrequency, and converges to the static result for large times.\n", "  We quantify the notion of a dense soliton gas by establishing an upper bound\nfor the integrated density of states of the quantum-mechanical Schr\\\"odinger\noperator associated with the KdV soliton gas dynamics. As a by-product of our\nderivation we find the speed of sound in the soliton gas with Gaussian spectral\ndistribution function.\n", "  One-point functions of certain non-protected scalar operators in the defect\nCFT dual to the D3-D5 probe brane system with k units of world volume flux can\nbe expressed as overlaps between Bethe eigenstates of the Heisenberg spin chain\nand a matrix product state. We present a closed expression of determinant form\nfor these one-point functions, valid for any value of k. The determinant\nformula factorizes into the k=2 result times a k-dependent prefactor. Making\nuse of the transfer matrix of the Heisenberg spin chain we recursively relate\nthe matrix product state for higher even and odd k to the matrix product state\nfor k=2 and k=3 respectively. We furthermore find evidence that the matrix\nproduct states for k=2 and k=3 are related via a ratio of Baxter's Q-operators.\nThe general k formula has an interesting thermodynamical limit involving a\nnon-trivial scaling of k, which indicates that the match between string and\nfield theory one-point functions found for chiral primaries might be tested for\nnon-protected operators as well. We revisit the string computation for chiral\nprimaries and discuss how it can be extended to non-protected operators.\n", "  $1/f$ noise caused by microscopic Two-Level Systems (TLS) is known to be very\ndetrimental to the performance of superconducting quantum devices but the\nnature of these TLS is still poorly understood. Recent experiments with\nsuperconducting resonators indicates that interaction between TLS in the oxide\nat the film-substrate interface is not negligible. Here we present data on the\nloss and $1/f$ frequency noise from two different Nb resonators with and\nwithout Pt capping and discuss what conclusions can be drawn regarding the\nproperties of TLS in amorphous oxides. We also estimate the concentration and\ndipole moment of the TLS.\n", "  Thermalons can mediate phase transitions between different vacua in higher\ncurvature gravity, potentially changing the asymptotic structure of the\nspacetime. Treating the cosmological constant as a dynamical parameter, we\nstudy these phase transitions in the context of extended thermodynamic phase\nspace. We find that in addition to the AdS to dS phase transitions previously\nstudied, thermal AdS space can undergo a phase transition to an asymptotically\nflat black hole geometry. In the context of AdS to AdS transitions, we comment\non the similarities and differences between thermalon transitions and the\nHawking-Page transition.\n", "  Effective magnetic $SU(N)$ gauge theory with classical $Z_N$ flux tubes of\nintrinsic width $\\frac{1}{M}$ is an effective field theory of the long distance\nquark-antiquark interaction in $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory. Long wavelength\nfluctuations of the $Z_N$ vortices of this theory lead to an effective string\ntheory. In this paper we clarify the connection between effective field theory\nand effective string theory and we propose a new constraint on these vortices.\nWe first examine the impact of string fluctuations on the classical dual\nsuperconductor description of confinement. At inter-quark distances $R\\sim\n\\frac{1}{M}$ the classical action for a straight flux tube determines the heavy\nquark potentials. At distances $R \\gg \\frac{1}{M}$ fluctuations of the flux\ntube axis $\\tilde{x}$ give rise to an effective string theory with an action\n$S_{eff} (\\tilde{x})$, the classical action for a curved flux tube, evaluated\nin the limit $\\frac{1}{M} \\rightarrow 0~$. This action is equal to the\nNambu-Goto action. These conclusions are independent of the details of the\n$Z_N$ flux tube. Further, we assume the QCD flux tube satisfies the additional\nconstraint: $$\\int_0^\\infty r dr \\frac{T_{\\theta \\theta} (r)}{r^2} =0,$$ where\n$\\frac{T_{\\theta \\theta}(r)}{r^2}$ is the value of the $\\theta\\theta$ component\nof the stress tensor at a distance $r$ from the axis of an infinite flux tube.\nUnder this constraint the string tension $\\sigma$ equals the force on a quark\nin the chromoelectric field $\\vec{E}$ of an infinite straight flux tube, and\nthe Nambu-Goto action can be represented in terms of the chromodynamic fields\nof effective magnetic $SU(N)$ gauge theory, yielding a field theory\ninterpretation of effective string theory.\n", "  The dramatic hard-soft spectral transition in Black Hole Binaries is\nimportant as it is associated with the collapse of the jet and with the\nstrongest low frequency QPOs. These transition spectra (intermediate and very\nhigh state: VHS) are complex, with soft but distinctly non-thermal\nComptonisation which merges smoothly into the disc emission. Here we develop a\nphysical model for the accretion flow which can accommodate all these features,\nwith an outer standard disc, which can make a transition to an energetically\ncoupled disc-corona region, and make a further transition to a hot inner flow\nwhich can be radiatively inefficient if required. The code explicitly uses\nfully relativistic emissivity (Novikov-Thorne), and all Comptonisation is\ncalculated with a hybrid (thermal and non-thermal) electron distribution. We\nfit this to a VHS spectrum from GX 339-4. We show that the complex continuum\ncurvature produced by a hybrid electron distribution is enough to remove the\nstrong constraint on black hole spin derived from reflection using simpler\nComptonisation models. More fundamentally, we show that the VHS cannot be fit\nwith the same Novikov-Thorne emissivity which can fit the disc dominated\nspectrum but instead requires that the inner flow is somewhat radiatively\ninefficient. This is consistent with an accretion powered jet, but simultaneous\nradio data show that the jet has already collapsed at the time of our data.\nInstead, it could point to truncation of the inner flow at radii larger than\nthe innermost stable circular orbit, as predicted by the Lense-Thirring QPO\nmodels.\n", "  High time resolution radio surveys over the last few years have discovered a\npopulation of millisecond-duration transient bursts called Fast Radio Bursts\n(FRBs), which remain of unknown origin. FRBs exhibit dispersion consistent with\npropagation through a cold plasma and dispersion measures indicative of an\norigin at cosmological distances. In this paper we perform Monte Carlo\nsimulations of a cosmological population of FRBs, based on assumptions\nconsistent with observations of their energy distribution, their spatial\ndensity as a function of redshift and the properties of the interstellar and\nintergalactic media. We examine whether the dispersion measures, fluences,\ninferred redshifts, signal-to-noises and effective widths of known FRBs are\nconsistent with a cosmological population. Statistical analyses indicate that\nat least 50 events at Parkes are required to distinguish between a constant\nco-moving FRB density, and a FRB density that evolves with redshift like the\ncosmological star formation rate density.\n", "  We consider two coupled populations of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons.\nDepending on the coupling strength, mean fields generated by these populations\ncan have incommensurate frequencies, or become frequency locked. In the\nobserved 2:1 locking state of the mean fields, individual neurons in one\npopulation are asynchronous with the mean fields, while in another populations\nthey have the same frequency as the mean field. These synchronous neurons form\na chimera state, where part of them build a fully synchronized cluster, while\nother remain scattered. We explain this chimera as a marginal one, caused by a\nself-organized neutral dynamics of the effective circle map.\n", "  MoS$_2$, one of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), has caused a lot of\nattentions for its excellent semiconductor characteristics and potential\napplications. Here, based on the density functional theory methods, we predict\na novel 2D quantum spin hall (QSH) insulator in the porous allotrope of\nmonolayer MoS$_2$ (g-MoS$_2$), consisting of MoS$_2$ square and hexagon. The\ng-MoS$_2$ has a nontrivial gap as large as 109 meV, comparable with previous\nreported 1T'-MoS$_2$ (80 meV), so-MoS$_2$ (25 meV). We demonstrate that the\norigin of 2D QSH effect in g-MoS$_2$ originates from the pure d-d band\ninteraction, different from conventional band inversion between s$-$p, p$-$p or\nd$-$p orbitals. Such new polymorph greatly enriches the TMDs family and its\nstabilities are confirmed by phonon spectrum analysis. In particular, porous\nstructure also endows it potential application in efficient gas separation and\nenergy storage.\n", "  We revisit the theory of null shells in general relativity, with a particular\nemphasis on null shells placed at horizons of black holes. We study in detail\nthe considerable freedom that is available in the case that one solders two\nmetrics together across null hypersurfaces (such as Killing horizons) for which\nthe induced metric is invariant under translations along the null generators.\nIn this case the group of soldering transformations turns out to be infinite\ndimensional, and these solderings create non-trivial horizon shells containing\nboth massless matter and impulsive gravitational wave components. We also\nrephrase this result in the language of Carrollian symmetry groups. To\nillustrate this phenomenon we discuss in detail the example of shells on the\nhorizon of the Schwarzschild black hole (with equal interior and exterior\nmass), uncovering a rich classical structure at the horizon and deriving an\nexplicit expression for the general horizon shell energy-momentum tensor. In\nthe special case of BMS-like soldering supertranslations we find a conserved\nshell-energy that is strikingly similar to the standard expression for\nasymptotic BMS supertranslation charges, suggesting a direct relation between\nthe physical properties of these horizon shells and the recently proposed BMS\nsupertranslation hair of a black hole.\n", "  Motivated by the recent findings that the ratio $\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon$ in\nthe Standard Model (SM) appears to be significantly below the data we\ninvestigate whether the necessary enhancement of this ratio can be obtained in\n331 models, in which new physics (NP) contributions to\n$\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon$ and other flavour observables are dominated by\ntree-level exchanges of a $Z^\\prime$. NP contributions to\n$\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon$ in these models are governed by the electroweak\noperator $Q_8$ for which the hadronic matrix element is rather well known so\nthat our analysis of NP contributions is subject to much smaller uncertainties\nthan within the SM. We consider seven 331 models selected in our earlier\nanalysis on the basis of electroweak precision data. Imposing the constraints\nfrom $\\Delta F=2$ transitions we find that only three of these models can\nprovide a significant positive shift in $\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon$ up to\n$6\\times 10^{-4}$ for $M_{Z^\\prime}=3$ TeV. Two of them allow simultaneously a\nsupression of ${\\cal B}(B_{s}\\to \\mu^+\\mu^-)$ by $20\\%$, bringing the theory\ncloser to the data without any significant impact on the Wilson coefficient\n$C_9$. The third one provides also the shift $\\Delta C_9=-0.6$, softening the\nanomalies in $B\\to K^*\\mu^+\\mu^-$, without any significant impact on $B_{s}\\to\n\\mu^+\\mu^-$. NP effects in rare $K$ decays and in $B\\to K(K^*)\\nu\\bar\\nu$ turn\nout to be small. The flavour structure of 331 models implies that even for\n$M_{Z^\\prime}=30$ Tev a shift of $\\varepsilon'/\\varepsilon$ up to $8\\times\n10^{-4}$ and a significant shift in $\\varepsilon_K$ can be obtained, while the\neffects in other flavour observables are small.\n", "  Ground- and excited-state UV photoelectron spectra of thiouracils\n(2-thiouracil, 4-thiouracil and 2,4-dithiouracil) have been simulated using\nmultireference configuration interaction calculations and Dyson norms as\nmeasure for the photoionization intensity. Except for a constant shift, the\ncalculated spectrum of 2-thiouracil agrees very well with experiment, while no\nexperimental spectra are available for the two other compounds. For all three\nmolecules, the photoelectron spectra show distinct bands due to ionization of\nthe sulphur and oxygen lone pairs and the pyrimidine $\\pi$ system. The\nexcited-state photoelectron spectra of 2-thiouracil show bands at much lower\nenergies than in the ground state spectrum, allowing to monitor the\nexcited-state population in time-resolved UV photoelectron spectroscopy (TRPES)\nexperiments. However, the results also reveal that single-photon ionization\nprobe schemes alone will not allow monitoring all photodynamic processes\nexisting in 2-thiouracil. Especially, due to overlapping bands of singlet and\ntriplet states the clear observation of intersystem crossing will be hampered.\n", "  We study RN/CFT correspondence for four dimensional extremal\nReissner-Nordstrom black hole. We uplift the 4d RN black hole to a 5d rotating\nblack hole and make a geometric regularization of the 5d space-time. Both hands\ncentral charges are obtained correctly at the same time by Brown-Henneaux\ntechnique.\n", "  A foremost task in understanding the nature of the $X(3872)$ involves the\ndiscrimination of the two-quark and multiquark configurations. In this work, we\npropose a method to probe the short-distance component of the $X(3872)$ by\nmeasuring the ratio between the $B_c$ semileptonic and nonleptonic decays into\nthe $X(3872)$. We demonstrate that if the $X(3872)$ production mechanism is\nthrough the $\\bar cc$ component, the ratios would be universal and could be\nreliably predicted in theory. Measurements of these ratios at LHC and the\nnext-generation electron-positron colliders are capable of\nvalidating/invalidating this production mechanism and providing deeper insights\ninto the nature of the $X(3872)$.\n", "  Systematic calculations of the Coulomb barrier parameters for collisions of\nspherical nuclei are performed within the framework of the double folding\napproach. The value of the parameter $B_Z=Z_PZ_T/(A^{1/3}_P+(A^{1/3}_P)$ (which\nestimates the Coulomb barrier height) varies in these calculations from 10 MeV\nup to 150 MeV. The nuclear densities came from the Hartree-Fock calculations\nwhich reproduce the experimental charge densities with good accuracy. For the\nnucleon-nucleon effective interaction two analytical approximations known in\nthe literature are used: the M3Y and Migdal forces. The calculations show that\nMigdal interaction always results in the higher Coulomb barrier. Moreover, as\n$B_Z$ increases the difference between the M3Y and Migdal barrier heights\nsystematically increases as well. As the result, the above barrier fusion cross\nsections calculated dynamically with the M3Y forces and surface friction are in\nagreement with the data. The cross sections calculated with the Migdal forces\nare always below the experimental data even without accounting for the\ndissipation.\n", "  To investigate the two-body dissipation effects on the synthesis of\nsuperheavy elements, we calculate low-energy collisions of the $N=50$ isotones\n($^{82}$Ge, $^{84}$Se, $^{86}$Kr and $^{88}$Sr) on $^{208}$Pb using the\ntime-dependent density-matrix theory (TDDM). TDDM is an extension of the\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory and can determine the time evolution\nof one-body and two-body density matrices. Thus TDDM describes both one-body\nand two-body dissipation of collective energies. It is shown that the two-body\ndissipation may increase fusion cross sections and enhance the synthesis of\nsuperheavy elements.\n", "  We consider $f\\left(R\\right) $-gravity in a\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetime with zero spatial curvature. We\napply the Killing tensors of the minisuperspace in order to specify the\nfunctional form of $f\\left(R\\right) $ and the field equations to be invariant\nunder Lie-B\\\"acklund transformations which are linear in the momentum (contact\nsymmetries). Consequently, the field equations to admit quadratic conservation\nlaws given by Noether's Theorem. We find three new integrable $f\\left(R\\right)\n$ models, for which with the application of the conservation laws we reduce the\nfield equations to a system of two first-order ordinary differential equations.\nFor each model we study the evolution of the cosmological fluid. Where we find\nthat for the one integrable model the cosmological fluid has an equation of\nstate parameter, in which in the latter there is a linear behavior in terms of\nthe scale factor which describes the Chevallier, Polarski and Linder (CPL)\nparametric dark energy model.\n", "  A famous result of Lieb establishes that the map $(A,B) \\mapsto\n\\text{tr}\\left[K^* A^{1-t} K B^t\\right]$ is jointly concave in the pair $(A,B)$\nof positive definite matrices, where $K$ is a fixed matrix and $t \\in [0,1]$.\nIn this paper we show that Lieb's function admits an explicit semidefinite\nprogramming formulation for any rational $t \\in [0,1]$. Our construction makes\nuse of a semidefinite formulation of weighted matrix geometric means. We\nprovide an implementation of our constructions in Matlab.\n", "  We present the discovery of a Neptune-mass planet orbiting a 0.8 +- 0.3 M_Sun\nstar in the Galactic bulge. The planet manifested itself during the\nmicrolensing event MOA 2011-BLG-028/OGLE-2011-BLG-0203 as a low-mass companion\nto the lens star. The analysis of the light curve provides the measurement of\nthe mass ratio: (1.2 +- 0.2) x 10^-4, which indicates the mass of the planet to\nbe 12-60 Earth masses. The lensing system is located at 7.3 +- 0.7 kpc away\nfrom the Earth near the direction to Baade's Window. The projected separation\nof the planet, at the time of the microlensing event, was 3.1-5.2 AU. Although\nthe \"microlens parallax\" effect is not detected in the light curve of this\nevent, preventing the actual mass measurement, the uncertainties of mass and\ndistance estimation are narrowed by the measurement of the source star proper\nmotion on the OGLE-III images spanning eight years, and by the low amount of\nblended light seen, proving that the host star cannot be too bright and\nmassive. We also discuss the inclusion of undetected parallax and orbital\nmotion effects into the models, and their influence onto the final physical\nparameters estimates.\n", "  Galaxies' interstellar media (ISM) are observed to be\nsupersonically-turbulent, but the ultimate power source that drives turbulent\nmotion remains uncertain. The two dominant models are that the turbulence is\ndriven by star formation feedback and/or that it is produced by gravitational\ninstability in the gas. Here we show that, while both models predict that the\ngalaxies' ISM velocity dispersions will be positively correlated with their\nstar formation rates, the forms of the correlation predicted by these two\nmodels are subtly but measurably different. A feedback-driven origin for the\nturbulence predicts a velocity dispersion that rises more sharply with star\nformation rate, and that does not depend on the gas fraction (i.e. $\\dot{M}_*\n\\propto \\sigma^2$), while a gravity-driven model yields a shallower rise and a\nstrong dependence on gas fraction (i.e. $\\dot{M}_* \\propto f_g^2 \\sigma$). We\ncompare the models to a collection of data on local and high-redshift galaxies\nculled from the literature, and show that the correlation expected for\ngravity-driven turbulence is a better match to the observations than a\nfeedback-driven model. This suggests that gravity is the ultimate source of ISM\nturbulence, at least in the rapidly-star-forming, high velocity dispersion\ngalaxies for which our test is most effective. We conclude by discussing the\nlimitations of the present data set, and the prospects for future measurements\nto enable a more definitive test of the two models.\n", "  We study high-energy jet production in the multi-Regge limit making use of\nthe Monte Carlo event generator BFKLex which includes collinear improvements in\nthe form of double-log contributions as presented in [1]. Making use of the\nanti-kt jet algorithm in the FastJet implementation, we present results for the\naverage transverse momentum and azimuthal angle of the produced jets when two\ntagged forward/backward jets are present in the final state. We also introduce\na new observable which accounts for the average rapidity separation among\nsubsequent emissions. Results are presented, for comparison, at leading order\nand next-to-leading order, with the resummation of collinear double logs\nproposed in [2].\n", "  The $Z^\\pm_c(3900)/Z^\\pm_c(3885)$ resonant structure has been experimentally\nobserved in the $Y(4260) \\to J/\\psi \\pi\\pi$ and $Y(4260) \\to \\bar{D}^\\ast D\n\\pi$ decays. This structure is intriguing since it is a prominent candidate of\nan exotic hadron. Yet, its nature is unclear so far. In this work, we\nsimultaneously describe the $\\bar{D}^\\ast D$ and $J/\\psi \\pi$ invariant mass\ndistributions in which the $Z_c$ peak is seen using amplitudes with exact\nunitarity. Two different scenarios are statistically acceptable, where the\norigin of the $Z_c$ state is different. They correspond to using energy\ndependent or independent $\\bar D^* D$ $S$-wave interaction. In the first one,\nthe $Z_c$ peak is due to a resonance with a mass around the $D\\bar D^*$\nthreshold. In the second one, the $Z_c$ peak is produced by a virtual state\nwhich must have a hadronic molecular nature. In both cases the two\nobservations, $Z^\\pm_c(3900)$ and $Z^\\pm_c(3885)$, are shown to have the same\ncommon origin, and a $\\bar D^* D$ bound state solution is not allowed. Precise\nmeasurements of the line shapes around the $D\\bar D^*$ threshold are called for\nin order to understand the nature of this state.\n", "  We discuss the formulation of the scattering asymptotic condition as a strong\nlimit in Euclidean quantum theories satisfying the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms.\nWhen used with the invariance principle this provides a constructive method to\ncompute scattering observables directly in the Euclidean formulation of the\ntheory, without an explicit analytic continuation.\n", "  A proposal of electrically controlled spin transistor in helical magnetic\nfield is presented. In the proposed device, the transistor action is driven by\nthe Landau-Zener transitions that lead to a backscattering of spin polarized\nelectrons and switching the transistor into the high-resistance state (off\nstate). The on/off state of the transistor can be controlled by the\nall-electric means using Rashba spin-orbit coupling that can be tuned by the\nvoltages applied to the side electrodes.\n", "  Standing fast sausage modes in flare loops were suggested to account for a\nconsiderable number of quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in the light curves of\nsolar flares. This study continues our investigation into the possibility to\ninvert the measured periods $P$ and damping times $\\tau$ of sausage modes to\ndeduce the transverse Alfv\\'en time $R/v_{\\rm Ai}$, density contrast $\\rho_{\\rm\ni}/\\rho_{\\rm e}$, and the steepness of the density distribution transverse to\nflare loops. A generic dispersion relation (DR) governing linear sausage modes\nis derived for pressureless cylinders where density inhomogeneity of arbitrary\nform takes place within the cylinder. We show that in general the inversion\nproblem is under-determined for QPP events where only a single sausage mode\nexists, be the measurements spatially resolved or unresolved. While $R/v_{\\rm\nAi}$ can be inferred to some extent, the range of possible steepness parameters\nmay be too broad to be useful. However, for spatially resolved measurements\nwhere an additional mode is present, it is possible to deduce self-consistently\n$\\rho_{\\rm i}/\\rho_{\\rm e}$, the profile steepness, and the internal Alfv\\'en\nspeed $v_{\\rm Ai}$. We show that at least for a recent QPP event that involves\na fundamental kink mode in addition to a sausage one, flare loop parameters are\nwell constrained, even if the specific form of the transverse density\ndistribution remains unknown. We conclude that spatially resolved, multi-mode\nQPP measurements need to be pursued for inferring flare loop parameters.\n", "  We consider the interplay between explicit and spontaneous symmetry breaking\nin strongly coupled field theories. Some well-known statements, such as the\nGell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation, descend directly from the Ward identities and\nhave thus a general relevance. Such Ward identities are recovered in\ngauge/gravity dual setups through holographic renormalization. In a simple\nparadigmatic three dimensional toy-model, we find analytic expressions for the\ntwo-point correlators which match all the quantum field theoretical\nexpectations. Moreover, we have access to the full spectrum, which is\nreminiscent of linear confinement.\n", "  This study presents elemental abundances of the early A-type supergiant HD\n80057 and the late A-type supergiant HD80404. High resolution and high\nsignal-to-noise ratio spectra published by the UVES Paranal Observatory Project\n(Bagnulo et al., 2003) were analysed to compute their elemental abundances\nusing ATLAS9 (Kurucz, 1993, 2005; Sbordone et al., 2004). In our analysis we\nassumed local thermodynamic equilibrium. The atmospheric parameters of HD 80057\nused in this study are from Firnstein & Przybilla (2012), and that of HD80404\nare derived from spectral energy distribution, ionization equilibria of Cr I/II\nand Fe I/II, and the fits to the wings of Balmer lines and Paschen lines as\nTeff = 7700 +/- 150 K and log g=1.60 +/- 0.15 (in cgs). The microturbulent\nvelocities of HD 80057 and HD 80404 have been determined as 4.3 +/- 0.1 and 2.2\n+/- 0.7 km s^-1 . The rotational velocities are 15 +/-1 and 7 +/- 2 km s^-1 and\ntheir macroturbulence velocities are 24 +/-2 and 2+/-1 km s^-1 . We have given\nthe abundances of 27 ions of 20 elements for HD 80057 and 39 ions of 25\nelements for HD80404. The abundances are close to solar values, except for some\nelements (Na, Sc, Ti, V, Ba, and Sr). We have found the metallicities [M/H] for\nHD 80057 and HD 80404 as -0.15 +/- 0.24 and -0.02 +/- 0.20 dex, respectively.\nThe evolutionary status of these stars are discussed and their\nnitrogen-to-carbon (N/C) and nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) ratios show that they are\nin their blue supergiant phase before the red supergiant region.\n", "  We review the current state of knowledge of the nucleon polarizabilities and\nof their role in nucleon Compton scattering and in hydrogen spectrum. We\ndiscuss the basic concepts, the recent lattice QCD calculations and advances in\nchiral effective-field theory. On the experimental side, we review the ongoing\nprograms aimed to measure the nucleon (scalar and spin) polarizabilities via\nthe Compton scattering processes, with real and virtual photons. A great part\nof the review is devoted to the general constraints based on unitarity,\ncausality, discrete and continuous symmetries, which result in\nmodel-independent relations involving nucleon polarizabilities. We (re-)derive\na variety of such relations and discuss their empirical value. The proton\npolarizability effects are presently the major sources of uncertainty in the\nassessment of the muonic hydrogen Lamb shift and hyperfine structure. Recent\ncalculations of these effects are reviewed here in the context of the\n\"proton-radius puzzle\". We conclude with summary plots of the recent results\nand prospects for the near-future work.\n", "  We present numerical simulations of properties of a parsec-scale torus\nexposed to illumination by the central black hole in an active galaxy (AGN).\nOur physical model allows to investigate the balance between the formation of\nwinds and accretion simultaneously. Radiation-driven winds are allowed by\ntaking into account radiation pressure due to UV and IR radiation along with\nX-ray heating and dust sublimation. Accretion is allowed through angular\nmomentum transport and the solution of the equations of radiation\nhydrodynamics. Our methods adopt flux-limited diffusion radiation-hydrodynamics\nfor the dusty, infrared pressure driven part of the flow, along with X-ray\nheating and cooling. Angular momentum transport in the accreting part of the\nflow is modeled using effective viscosity. Our results demonstrate that\nradiation pressure on dust can play an important role in shaping AGN\nobscuration. For example, when the luminosity illuminating the torus exceeds\n$L>0.01\\,L_{\\rm Edd}$, where $L_{\\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington luminosity, we find\nno episodes of sustained disk accretion because radiation pressure does not\nallow a disk to form. Despite the absence of the disk accretion, the flow of\ngas to smaller radii still proceeds at a rate $10^{-4}-10^{-1}\\,M_\\odot\\,{\\rm\nyr}^{-1}$ through the capturing of the gas from the hot evaporative flow, thus\nproviding a mechanism to deliver gas from a radiation-pressure dominated torus\nto the inner accretion disk. As $L/L_{\\rm edd}$ increases, larger radiation\ninput leads to larger torus aspect ratios and increased obscuration of the\ncentral black hole. We also find the important role of the X-ray heated gas in\nshaping of the obscuring torus.\n", "  Quantum Monte Carlo simulations at zero temperature of a $^3$He monolayer\nadsorbed on graphite, either clean or preplated with $^4$He, unexpectedly point\nto a gas-liquid phase transition at a very low areal density of the order of\n0.01\\AA$^{-2}$. This result stems from an essentially unbiased calculation of\nthe ground state energy for an infinite, defect-free substrate which interacts\nwith He atoms via a realistic potential, whereas the interaction between two He\natoms includes two- and three-body terms. The sensitivity of the gas-liquid\ncoexistence region on the model Hamiltonian employed is discussed.\n", "  We analyse the low-energy phenomenology of alignment models both\nmodel-independently and within supersymmetric (SUSY) scenarios focusing on\ntheir CP violation tests at LHCII. Assuming that New Physics (NP) contributes\nto K-Kbar and D-Dbar mixings only through non-renormalizable operators\ninvolving SU(2)_L quark-doublets, we derive model-independent correlations\namong CP violating observables of the two systems. Due to universality of CP\nviolation in Delta F=1 processes the bound on CP violation in Kaon mixing\ngenerically leads to an upper bound on the size of CP violation in D mixing.\nInterestingly, this bound is similar in magnitude to the current sensitivity\nreached by the LHCb experiment which is starting now to probe the natural\npredictions of alignment models. Within SUSY, we perform an exact analytical\ncomputation of the full set of contributions for the D-Dbar mixing amplitude.\nWe point out that chargino effects are comparable and often dominant with\nrespect to gluino contributions making their inclusion in phenomenological\nanalyses essential. As a byproduct, we clarify the limit of applicability of\nthe commonly used mass insertion approximation in scenarios with\nquasi-degenerate and split squarks.\n", "  The concept of high refractive index subwavelength dielectric nanoresonators,\nsupporting electric and magnetic optical resonances, is a promising platform\nfor waveguiding, sensing, and nonlinear nanophotonic devices. However, high\nconcentration of defects in the nanoresonators diminishes their resonant\nproperties, which are crucially dependent on their internal losses. Therefore,\nit seems to be inevitable to use initially crystalline materials for\nfabrication of the nanoresonators. Here, we show that the fabrication of\ncrystalline (low-loss) resonant silicon nanoparticles by femtosecond laser\nablation of amorphous (high-loss) silicon thin films is possible. We apply two\nconceptually different approaches: recently proposed laser-induced transfer and\na novel laser writing technique for large-scale fabrication of the crystalline\nnanoparticles. The crystallinity of the fabricated nanoparticles is proven by\nRaman spectroscopy and electron transmission microscopy, whereas optical\nresonant properties of the nanoparticles are studied using dark-field optical\nspectroscopy and full-wave electromagnetic simulations.\n", "  We study the $B^0$ decay to $D^0 \\bar D^0 K^0$ based on the chiral unitary\nmodel that generates the X(3720) resonance, and make predictions for the $D^0\n\\bar D^0$ invariant mass distribution. From the shape of the distribution, the\nexistence of the resonance below threshold could be induced. We also predict\nthe rate of production of the X(3720) resonance to the $D^0 \\bar D^0$ mass\ndistribution with no free parameters.\n", "  In order to study the type of collapse, mentioned in the title, we introduce\na physically meaningful object, called the horizon function. It directly enters\nthe expressions for many of the stellar characteristics. The main junction\nequation, which governs the collapse, transforms into a Riccati equation with\nsimple coefficients for the horizon function. We integrate this equation in the\ngeodesic case. The same is done in the general case when one or another of the\ncoefficients vanish. It is shown how to build classes of star models in this\nformulation of the problem and simple solutions are given.\n", "  Low temperature specific heat has been measured in superconductor $\\beta$-FeS\nwith T$_c$ = 4.55 K. It is found that the low temperature electronic specific\nheat C$_e$/T can be fitted to a linear relation in the low temperature region,\nbut fails to be described by an exponential relation as expected by an s-wave\ngap. We try fittings to the data with different gap structures and find that a\nmodel with one or two nodal gaps can fit the data. Under a magnetic field, the\nfield induced specific heat $\\Delta\\gamma$=[C$_e$(H)-C$_e$(0)]/T shows the\nVolovik relation $\\Delta\\gamma_e(H)\\propto \\sqrt{H}$, suggesting the presence\nof nodal gap(s) in this material.\n", "  We investigate how the gravitational baryogenesis mechanism can potentially\nconstrain the form of a Type IV singularity. Specifically, we study two\ndifferent models with interesting phenomenology, that realize two distinct Type\nIV singularities, one occurring at the end of inflation and one during the\nradiation domination era or during the matter domination era. As we\ndemonstrate, the Type IV singularities occurring at the matter domination era\nor during the radiation domination era, are constrained by the gravitational\nbaryogenesis, in such a way so that these do not render the baryon to entropy\nratio singular. Both the cosmological models we study cannot be realized in the\ncontext of ordinary Einstein-Hilbert gravity, and hence our work can only be\nrealized in the context of $F(R)$ gravity and more generally in the context of\nmodified gravity only.\n", "  Intensity mapping of the neutral hydrogen (HI) is a new observational tool\nthat can be used to efficiently map the large-scale structure of the Universe\nover wide redshift ranges. The power spectrum of the intensity maps contains\ncosmological information on the matter distribution and probes galaxy evolution\nby tracing the HI content of galaxies at different redshifts and the\nscale-dependence of HI clustering. The cross-correlation of intensity maps with\ngalaxy surveys is a robust measure of the power spectrum which diminishes\nsystematics caused by instrumental effects and foreground removal. We examine\nthe cross-correlation signature at redshift z=0.9 using a variant of the\nsemi-analytical galaxy formation model SAGE (Croton et al. 2016) applied to the\nMillennium simulation in order to model the HI gas of galaxies as well as their\noptical magnitudes based on their star-formation history. We determine the\nclustering of the cross-correlation power for different types of galaxies\ndetermined by their colours, acting as a proxy for their star-formation\nactivity. We find that the cross-correlation coefficient for red quiescent\ngalaxies falls off more quickly on smaller scales k>0.2h/Mpc than for blue\nstar-forming galaxies. Additionally, we create a mock catalogue of highly\nstar-forming galaxies using a selection function to mimic the WiggleZ survey,\nand use this to predict existing and future cross-correlation measurements of\nthe GBT and Parkes telescope. We find that the cross-power of highly\nstar-forming galaxies shows a higher clustering on small scales than any other\ngalaxy type and that this significantly alters the power spectrum shape on\nscales k>0.2h/Mpc. We show that the cross-correlation coefficient is not\nnegligible when interpreting the cosmological cross-power spectrum. On the\nother hand, it contains information about the HI content of the optically\nselected galaxies.\n", "  We provide an anthropic reason that the supersymmetry breaking scale is much\nhigher than the electroweak scale as indicated by the null result of collider\nexperiments and observed 125 GeV Higgs boson. We focus on a new inflation model\nas a typical low-scale inflation model that may be expected in the string\nlandscape. In this model, the R-symmetry is broken at the minimum of the\ninflaton potential and its breaking scale is related to the reheating\ntemperature. Once we admit that the anthropic principle requires thermal\nleptogenesis, we obtain a lower bound on gravitino mass, which is related to\nR-symmetry breaking scale. This scenario and resulting gravitino mass predict\nthe consistent amplitude of density perturbations. We also find that string\naxions and saxions are consistently implemented in this scenario.\n", "  We propose a control scheme which can stabilize and fix the position of\nchimera states in small networks. Chimeras consist of coexisting domains of\nspatially coherent and incoherent dynamics in systems of nonlocally coupled\nidentical oscillators. Chimera states are generally difficult to observe in\nsmall networks due to their short lifetime and erratic drifting of the spatial\nposition of the incoherent domain. The control scheme, like a tweezer, might be\nuseful in experiments, where usually only small networks can be realized.\n", "  We study a region in the NMSSM parameter space in which the mass of the\nSM-like Higgs boson is uplifted by ~4-17 GeV, allowing for stop masses and\n|A_t| <= 1 TeV alleviating the little fine tuning problem of the MSSM. An\nuplift of the mass of the SM-like Higgs boson is possible in two distinct\nregions in the NMSSM parameter space: Either for large lambda and small\ntan(beta) or, through singlet-doublet mixing, for small lambda and large\ntan(beta). For a mostly singlet-like Higgs state H_S with a mass below 125 GeV\nwe investigate possible direct or indirect search channels at the run II of the\nLHC as function of the NMSSM-specific uplift of the mass of the SM-like Higgs\nboson: Direct production of H_S in gluon fusion with H_S decaying into\ndiphotons, modified reduced couplings of the SM-like Higgs state, and the\npossible production of H_S in ggF -> A -> Z + H_S. We find that the region\nfeaturing singlet-doublet mixing can be tested if searches at the LHC at 13 TeV\nfor BSM Higgs bosons in the mass range 88 - 102 GeV decaying into diphotons\nbecome sensitive to signal cross sections sigma(gg -> H_S -> diphotons) ~ 20\nfb, or if measurements of the reduced coupling kappa_V(H_{SM}) of the SM Higgs\nboson to electroweak gauge boson exclude (or confirm) the region\nkappa_V(H_{SM}) <~ 0.93.\n", "  The formal basis for fully relativistic Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) or\nmultiple scattering calculations for the electronic Green function in case of a\ngeneral potential is discussed. Simple criteria are given to identify\nsituations that require to distinguish between right and left hand side\nsolutions to the Dirac equation when setting up the electronic Green function.\nIn addition various technical aspects of an implementation of the relativistic\nKKR for general local and non-local potentials will be discussed.\n", "  We study the nonequilibrium dynamics of photoexcited electrons in the\nnarrow-gap Mott insulator VO$_2$. The initial stages of relaxation are treated\nusing a quantum Boltzmann equation methodology, which reveals a rapid ($\\sim$\nfemtosecond time scale) relaxation to a pseudothermal state characterized by a\nfew parameters that vary slowly in time. The long-time limit is then studied by\na Hartree-Fock methodology, which reveals the possibility of nonequilibrium\nexcitation to a new metastable $M_1$ metal phase that is qualitatively\nconsistent with a recent experiment. The general physical picture of\nphotoexcitation driving a correlated electron system to a new state that is not\naccessible in equilibrium may be applicable in similar materials.\n", "  We report high-resolution observations at mid-infrared wavelengths of a minor\nsolar flare, SOL2014-09-24T17T17:50 (C7.0), using Quantum Well Infrared\nPhotodetector (QWIP) cameras at an auxiliary of the McMath-Pierce telescope.\nThe flare emissions, the first simultaneous observations in two mid-infrared\nbands at $5\\ \\mu$m and $8\\ \\mu$m with white-light and hard X-ray coverage,\nrevealed impulsive time variability with increases on time scales of $\\sim 4$~s\nfollowed by exponential decay at $\\sim$10 s in two bright regions separated by\nabout 13$\"$. The brightest source is compact, unresolved spatially at the\ndiffraction limit ($1.3\"$ at $5\\ \\mu$m). We identify the IR sources as flare\nribbons also seen in white-light emission at 6173~\\AA~observed by SDO/HMI, with\ntwin hard X-ray sources observed by RHESSI, and with EUV sources (e.g., 94~\\AA)\nobserved by SDO/AIA. The two infrared points have closely the same flux density\n($f_\\nu$, W/m$^2$Hz) and extrapolate to a level about an order of magnitude\nbelow that observed in the visible band by HMI, but with a flux more than two\norders of magnitude above the free-free continuum from the hot ($\\sim$15 MK)\ncoronal flare loop observed in the X-ray range. The observations suggest that\nthe IR emission is optically thin, this constraint and others suggest major\ncontributions from a density less than about $3 \\times 10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$. We\ntentatively interpret this emission mechanism as predominantly free-free\nemission in a highly ionized but cool and rather dense chromospheric region.\n", "  We examine the efficacy of pion exchange models to simultaneously describe\nleading neutron electroproduction at HERA and the $\\bar{d}-\\bar{u}$ flavor\nasymmetry in the proton. A detailed $\\chi^2$ analysis of the ZEUS and H1 cross\nsections, when combined with constraints on the pion flux from Drell-Yan data,\nallows regions of applicability of one-pion exchange to be delineated. The\nanalysis disfavors several models of the pion flux used in the literature, and\nyields an improved extraction of the pion structure function and its\nuncertainties at parton momentum fractions in the pion of $4 \\times 10^{-4}\n\\lesssim x_\\pi \\lesssim 0.05$ at a scale of $Q^2$=10 GeV$^2$. Based on the fit\nresults, we provide estimates for leading proton structure functions in\nupcoming tagged deep-inelastic scattering experiments at Jefferson Lab on the\ndeuteron with forward protons.\n", "  We measure the cross-correlation between weak lensing of galaxy images and of\nthe cosmic microwave background (CMB). The effects of gravitational lensing on\ndifferent sources will be correlated if the lensing is caused by the same mass\nfluctuations. We use galaxy shape measurements from 139 deg$^{2}$ of the Dark\nEnergy Survey (DES) Science Verification data and overlapping CMB lensing from\nthe South Pole Telescope (SPT) and Planck. The DES source galaxies have a\nmedian redshift of $z_{\\rm med} {\\sim} 0.7$, while the CMB lensing kernel is\nbroad and peaks at $z{\\sim}2$. The resulting cross-correlation is maximally\nsensitive to mass fluctuations at $z{\\sim}0.44$. Assuming the Planck 2015\nbest-fit cosmology, the amplitude of the DES$\\times$SPT cross-power is found to\nbe $A = 0.88 \\pm 0.30$ and that from DES$\\times$Planck to be $A = 0.86 \\pm\n0.39$, where $A=1$ corresponds to the theoretical prediction. These are\nconsistent with the expected signal and correspond to significances of $2.9\n\\sigma$ and $2.2 \\sigma$ respectively. We demonstrate that our results are\nrobust to a number of important systematic effects including the shear\nmeasurement method, estimator choice, photometric redshift uncertainty and CMB\nlensing systematics. Significant intrinsic alignment of galaxy shapes would\nincrease the cross-correlation signal inferred from the data; we calculate a\nvalue of $A = 1.08 \\pm 0.36$ for DES$\\times$SPT when we correct the\nobservations with a simple IA model. With three measurements of this\ncross-correlation now existing in the literature, there is not yet reliable\nevidence for any deviation from the expected LCDM level of cross-correlation,\ngiven the size of the statistical uncertainties and the significant impact of\nsystematic errors, particularly IAs. We provide forecasts for the expected\nsignal-to-noise of the combination of the five-year DES survey and SPT-3G.\n", "  We construct tri-qubit genuinely entangled states which have positive partial\ntransposes with respect to bi-partition of systems. These examples disprove a\nconjecture [L. Novo, T. Moroder and O. G\\\" uhne, Phys.Rev.A {88}, 012305\n(2013)] which claims that PPT mixtures are necessary and sufficient for\nbiseparability of three qubits.\n", "  The polarization charge $\\rho $ of an inhomogeneous superfluid system is\nexpressed as a function of the order parameter $\\Phi\n({{\\mathbf{r}}_{1}},{{\\mathbf{r}}_{2}})$. It is shown that if the order\nparameter changes on macroscopic distances, the polarization charge ${{\\rho\n}_{pol}}$ is proportional to $A{{\\nabla }^{2}}n$, and the polarization\n$\\mathbf{P}$ is proportional to $A\\nabla n$, where $n$ is the density of the\nsystem. For noninteracting atoms the proportionality coefficient $A$ is\nindependent of density, and in the presence of interaction $A$ is proportional\nto $n$. The change of the Bose gas density is found in the presence of a flow\n$\\mathbf{w}={{\\mathbf{v}}_{n}}-{{\\mathbf{v}}_{s}}$ passing the vortex. It is\nfound that a vortex in a superfluid film creates an electric potential above\nthe film. This potential has the form of a potential of a dipole, allowing to\nassign a dipole moment to the vortex. The dipole moment is a sum of two terms,\nthe first one is proportional to the relative flow velocity $\\mathbf{w}$ and\nthe second one is proportional to $\\left[ \\mathbf{\\kappa }\\times \\mathbf{w}\n\\right]$, where $\\mathbf{\\kappa }$ is the vortex circulation.\n", "  Spectral and transport properties of electrons in confined phosphorene\nsystems are investigated in a five hopping parameter tight-binding model, using\nanalytical and numerical techniques. The main emphasis is on the properties of\nthe topological edge states accommodated by the quasi-flat band that\ncharacterizes the phosphorene energy spectrum. We show, in the particular case\nof phosphorene, how the breaking of the bipartite lattice structure gives rise\nto the electron-hole asymmetry of the energy spectrum. The properties of the\ntopological edge states in the zig-zag nanoribbons are analyzed under different\naspects: degeneracy, localization, extension in the Brillouin zone, dispersion\nof the quasi-flat band in magnetic field. The finite-size phosphorene plaquette\nexhibits a Hofstadter-type spectrum made up of two unequal butterflies\nseparated by a gap, where a quasi-flat band composed of zig-zag edge states is\nlocated. The transport properties are investigated by simulating a four-lead\nHall device (importantly, all leads are attached on the same zig-zag side), and\nusing the Landauer-Buttiker formalism. We find out that the chiral edge states\ndue to the magnetic field yield quantum Hall plateaus, but the topological edge\nstates in the gap do not support the quantum Hall effect and prove a\ndissipative behavior. By calculating the complex eigenenergies of the\nnon-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian that describes the open system\n(plaquette+leads), we prove the superradiance effect in the energy range of the\nquasi-flat band, with consequences for the density of states and electron\ntransmission properties.\n", "  We perform hydro- and magnetohydrodynamical general relativistic simulations\nof a tidal disruption of a $0.1\\,M_\\odot$ red dwarf approaching a\n$10^5\\,M_\\odot$ non-rotating massive black hole on a close (impact parameter\n$\\beta=10$) elliptical (eccentricity $e=0.97$) orbit. We track the debris\nself-interaction, circularization, and the accompanying accretion through the\nblack hole horizon. We find that the relativistic precession leads to the\nformation of a self-crossing shock. The dissipated kinetic energy heats up the\nincoming debris and efficiently generates a quasi-spherical outflow. The\nself-interaction is modulated because of the feedback exerted by the flow on\nitself. The debris quickly forms a thick, almost marginally bound disc that\nremains turbulent for many orbital periods. Initially, the accretion through\nthe black hole horizon results from the self-interaction, while in the later\nstages it is dominated by the debris originally ejected in the shocked region,\nas it gradually falls back towards the hole. The effective viscosity in the\ndebris disc stems from the original hydrodynamical turbulence, which dominates\nover the magnetic component. The radiative efficiency is very low because of\nlow energetics of the gas crossing the horizon and large optical depth that\nresults in photon trapping.\n", "  Gravitational waves are a prediction of general relativity, and with\nground-based detectors now running in their advanced configuration, we will\nsoon be able to measure them directly for the first time. Binaries of\nstellar-mass black holes are among the most interesting sources for these\ndetectors. Unfortunately, the many different parameters associated with the\nproblem make it difficult to promptly produce a large set of waveforms for the\nsearch in the data stream. To reduce the number of templates to develop, one\nmust restrict some of the physical parameters to a certain range of values\npredicted by either (electromagnetic) observations or theoretical modeling. In\nthis work we show that \"hyperstellar\" black holes (HSBs) with masses $30\n\\lesssim M_{\\rm BH}/M_{\\odot} \\lesssim 100$, i.e black holes significantly\nlarger than the nominal $10\\,M_{\\odot}$, will have an associated low value for\nthe spin, i.e. $a<0.5$. We prove that this is true regardless of the formation\nchannel, and that when two HSBs build a binary, each of the spin magnitudes is\nalso low, and the binary members have similar masses. We also address the\ndistribution of the eccentricities of HSB binaries in dense stellar systems\nusing a large suite of three-body scattering experiments that include\nbinary-single interactions and long-lived hierarchical systems with a highly\naccurate integrator, including relativistic corrections up to ${\\cal\nO}(1/c^5)$. We find that most sources in the detector band will have nearly\nzero eccentricities. This correlation between large, similar masses, low spin\nand low eccentricity will help to accelerate the searches for\ngravitational-wave signals.\n", "  A Higgs-like resonance with a mass of approximately 750 GeV has recently been\nobserved at the LHC in its diphoton decay. If this state is not simply a\nstatistical fluctuation which will disappear with more data, it will have\nimportant implications not only for particle physics but also for cosmology. In\nthis note, we analyze the implications of such a resonance for the dark matter\n(DM). Assuming a spin 1/2 DM particle, we first verify that indeed the correct\nrelic density can be obtain for a wide range of the particle mass and weak\nscale coupling that are compatible with present data. We then show that the\ncombination of near future direct and indirect detection experiments will allow\nto probe the CP-nature of the mediator resonance, i.e. check whether it is a\nscalar or a pseudoscalar like particle.\n", "  We speculate about the origin of the recent excess at ~750 GeV in diphoton\nresonance searches observed by the ATLAS and CMS experiments using the first 13\nTeV data. Its interpretation as a new scalar resonance produced in gluon fusion\nand decaying to photons is consistent with all relevant exclusion bounds from\nthe 8 TeV LHC run. We provide a simple phenomenological framework to\nparametrize the properties of the new resonance and show in a model-independent\nway that, if the scalar is produced in gluon fusion, additional new colored and\ncharged particles are required. Finally, we discuss some interpretations in\nvarious concrete setups, such as a singlet (pseudo-) scalar, composite Higgs,\nand the MSSM.\n", "  We report detailed measurements of the temperature dependence of the lower\ncritical field Hc1 in the stripe ordered La1.6-xNd0.4SrxCuO4 (x = 0.10 and\n0.15) superconductors. It is found that Hc1(T) of the samples increase with\ndecreasing temperature and show an negative curvature below Tc. The penetration\ndepth {\\lambda}(T) estimated from Hc1(T) data satisfies a linear temperature\ndependence behavior below Tc/2, which is consistent with that in a\nsuperconductor with d-wave symmetry of the energy gap and the upward trend in\nHc1(T) may be due to the cooperation of the hole and election pockets arising\nfrom the reconstruction of the Fermi surface, which contributes to illustrating\nthe Fermi surface reconstruction in La1.6-xNd0.4SrxCuO4.\n", "  It has been recently conjectured that scattering amplitudes in planar N=4\nsuper Yang-Mills are given by the volume of the (dual) amplituhedron. In this\npaper we show some interesting connections between the tree-level amplituhedron\nand a special class of differential equations. In particular we demonstrate how\nthe amplituhedron volume for NMHV amplitudes is determined by these\ndifferential equations. The new formulation allows for a straightforward\ngeometric description, without any reference to triangulations. Finally we\ndiscuss possible implications for volumes related to generic N^kMHV amplitudes.\n", "  We propose a new dynamics of the electroweak symmetry breaking in a\nclassically scale invariant version of the standard model. The scale invariance\nis broken by the condensations of additional fermions under a strong coupling\ndynamics. The electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by negative mass\nsquared of the elementary Higgs doublet, which is dynamically generated through\nthe bosonic seesaw mechanism. We introduce a real pseudo-scalar singlet field\ninteracting with additional fermions and Higgs doublet in order to avoid\nmassless Nambu-Goldstone bosons from the chiral symmetry breaking in a strong\ncoupling sector. We investigate the mass spectra and decay rates of these\npseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons, and show they can decay fast enough without\ncosmological problems. We further evaluate the energy dependences of the\ncouplings between elementary fields perturbatively, and find that our model is\nthe first one which realizes the flatland scenario with the dimensional\ntransmutation by the strong coupling dynamics. Similarly to the conventional\nflatland model with Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, the electroweak vacuum in our\nmodel is meta-stable.\n", "  We study type II string vacua defined by torus compactifications accompanied\nby T-duality twists. We realize the string vacua, specifically, by means of the\nasymmetric orbifolding associated to the chiral reflections combined with a\nshift, which are interpreted as describing the compactification on `T-folds'.\nWe discuss possible consistent actions of the chiral reflection on the\nRamond-sector of the world-sheet fermions, and explicitly construct\nnon-supersymmetric as well as supersymmetric vacua. Above all, we demonstrate a\nsimple realization of non-supersymmetric vacua with vanishing cosmological\nconstant at one loop. Our orbifold group is generated only by a single element,\nwhich results in simpler models than those with such property known previously.\n", "  We prove that in the critical Bernoulli percolation on two dimensional\nlattice slabs the probabilities of open left-right crossings of rectangles with\nany given aspect ratio are uniformly positive.\n", "  Renormalization is a powerful concept in the many-body problem. Inspired by\nthe highly successful density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm,\nand the quantum chemical graphical representation of configuration space, we\nintroduce a new theoretical tool: Hilbert space renormalization, to describe\nmany-electron correlations. While in DMRG, the many-body states in nested Fock\nsubspaces are successively renormalized, in Hilbert space renormalization,\nmany-body states in nested Hilbert subspaces undergo renormalization. This\nprovides a new way to classify and combine configurations. The underlying\nwavefunction ansatz, namely the Hilbert space matrix product state (HS-MPS),\nhas a very rich and flexible mathematical structure. It provides low-rank\ntensor approximations to any configuration interaction (CI) space through\nrestricting either the 'physical indices' or the coupling rules in the HS-MPS.\nAlternatively, simply truncating the 'virtual dimension' of the HS-MPS leads to\na family of size-extensive wave function ansaetze that can be used efficiently\nin variational calculations. We make formal and numerical comparisons between\nthe HS-MPS, the traditional Fock-space MPS used in DMRG, and traditional CI\napproximations. The analysis and results shed light on fundamental aspects of\nthe efficient representation of many-electron wavefunctions through the\nrenormalization of many-body states.\n", "  Based on the knowledge of the QCD radiation pattern, observables to\ndistinguish jets containing one and two $b$-hadrons are discussed. A simple\nmethod is used to combine pairs of the most sensitive observables, girth,\nnumber of charged tracks and the energy or momentum fraction of the leading\n$b$-hadron with respect to the jet, into one discriminator. Their efficiencies,\non particle level, are estimated and found to improve the performance and the\nrobustness of the observables in different momentum slices.\n"]}
