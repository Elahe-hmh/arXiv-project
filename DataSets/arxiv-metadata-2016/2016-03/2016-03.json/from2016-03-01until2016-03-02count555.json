and not a gamma-ray\nburst. Our analysis shows that the BAT burst spectrum is consistent with a\nthermonuclear flash (type-I X-ray burst) from the surface of an accreting\nneutron star in a binary system. The X-ray binary nature is further confirmed\nby the report of a detection of a faint point source at the position of the XRT\ncounterpart of the burst in archival XMM-Newton data approximately 6 years\nbefore the burst and in more recent XMM-Newton data obtained at the end of\nSeptember 2006 (nearly 4 months after the burst). Since the source is very\nlikely not a gamma-ray burst, we rename the source Swift J1749.4-2807, based on\nthe Swift/BAT discovery coordinates. Using the BAT data of the type-I X-ray\nburst we determined that the source is at most at a distance of 6.7+-1.3 kpc.\nFor a transiently accreting X-ray binary its soft X-ray behaviour is atypical:\nits 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity (as measured using the Swift/XRT data) decreased\nby nearly 3 orders of magnitude in about 1 day, much faster than what is\nusually seen for X-ray transients. If the earlier phases of the outburst also\nevolved this rapidly, then many similar systems might remain undiscovered\nbecause the X-rays are difficult to detect and the type-I X-ray bursts might be\nmissed by all sky surveying instruments. This source might be part of a class\nof very-fast transient low-mass X-ray binary systems of which there may be a\nsignificant population in our Galaxy.\n", "  We investigate properties of iron fluorescent line arising as a result of\nillumination of a black hole accretion disc by an X-ray source located above\nthe disc surface. We study in details the light-bending model of variability of\nthe line, extending previous work on the subject.\n  We indicate bending of photon trajectories to the equatorial plane, which is\na distinct property of the Kerr metric, as the most feasible effect underlying\nreduced variability of the line observed in several objects. A model involving\nan X-ray source with a varying radial distance, located within a few central\ngravitational radii around a rapidly rotating black hole, close to the disc\nsurface, may explain both the elongated red wing of the line profile and the\ncomplex variability pattern observed in MCG--6-30-15 by XMM-Newton.\n  We point out also that illumination by radiation which returns to the disc\n(following the previous reflection) contributes significantly to formation of\nthe line profile in some cases. As a result of this effect, the line profile\nalways has a pronounced blue peak (which is not observed in the deep minimum\nstate in MCG--6-30-15), unless the reflecting material is absent within the\ninnermost 2--3 gravitational radii.\n", "  The latest results on the sky distribution of ultra-high energy cosmic ray\nsources have consequences for their nature and time structure. If the sources\naccelerate predominantly nuclei of atomic number A and charge Z and emit\ncontinuously, their luminosity in cosmic rays above ~6x10^{19} eV can be no\nmore than a fraction of ~5x10^{-4} Z^{-2} of their total power output. Such\nsources could produce a diffuse neutrino flux that gives rise to several events\nper year in neutrino telescopes of km^3 size. Continuously emitting sources\nshould be easily visible in photons below ~100 GeV, but not in TeV gamma-rays\nwhich are likely absorbed within the source. For episodic sources that are\nbeamed by a Lorentz factor Gamma, the bursts or flares have to last at least\n~0.1 Gamma^{-4} A^{-4} yr. A considerable fraction of the flare luminosity\ncould go into highest energy cosmic rays, in which case the rate of flares per\nsource has to be less than ~5x10^{-3} Gamma^4 A^4 Z^2 yr^{-1}. Episodic sources\nshould have detectable variability both at GLAST and TeV energies, but neutrino\nfluxes may be hard to detect.\n", "  We report results from a Suzaku observation of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 NGC\n4051. During our observation, large amplitude rapid variability is seen and the\naveraged 2--10 keV flux is 8.1x10^-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2, which is several times\nlower than the historical average. The X-ray spectrum hardens when the source\nflux becomes lower, confirming the trend of spectral variability known for many\nSeyfert 1 galaxies. The broad-band averaged spectrum and spectra in high and\nlow flux intervals are analyzed. The spectra are first fitted with a model\nconsisting of a power-law component, a reflection continuum originating in cold\nmatter, a blackbody component, two zones of ionized absorber, and several\nGaussian emission lines. The amount of reflection is rather large (R ~ 7, where\nR=1 corresponds to reflection by an infinite slab), while the equivalent width\nof the Fe-K line at 6.4 keV is modest (140 eV) for the averaged spectrum. We\nthen model the overall spectra by introducing partial covering for the\npower-law component and reflection continuum independently. The column density\nfor the former is 1x10^23 cm^-2, while it is fixed at 1x10^24 cm-2 for the\nlatter. By comparing the spectra in different flux states, we identify the\ncauses of spectral variability. (abridged)\n", "  In laser-plasma interactions it is widely accepted that a non-uniform\ninteraction surface will invariably seed hydrodynamic instabilities and a\ngrowth in the amplitude of the initial modulation. Recent experimental results\n[Dromey, Nat. Phys. 2009] have demonstrated that there must be target smoothing\nin femtosecond timescale relativistic interactions, contrary to prevailing\nexpectation. In this paper we develop a theoretical description of the physical\nprocess that underlies this novel phenomena. We show that the surface dynamics\nin the few-cycle relativistic regime is dominated by the coherent electron\nmotion resulting in a smoothing of the electron surface. This stabilization of\nplasma surfaces is unique in laser-plasma interactions and demonstrates that\ndynamics in the few-cycle regime differ fundamentally from the longer pulse\nregimes. This has important consequences for applications such as radiation\npressure acceleration of protons and ions and harmonic generation from\nrelativistically oscillating surfaces.\n", "  We present a Suzaku observation of the dwarf Seyfert galaxy NGC4395 with an\nestimated black hole mass of ~10^5 Msun. Rapid and strong X-ray variability\nwith an rms amplitude of ~60 per cent is observed in the 0.4-10 keV band with\nthe XIS cameras. The shape of the light curve appears to depend on energies.\nThe hard X-ray emission is detected up to 35 keV with the HXD-PIN detector at a\nsimilar flux level as observed with the INTEGRAL IBIS. The X-ray spectrum below\n10 keV is strongly absorbed by partially ionized (xi~35) gas with a mean\nequivalent hydrogen column density of ~2e22 cm^-2, when a simple absorption\nmodel is applied. The spectral shape is also strongly variable but not a simple\nfunction of the source brightness. The spectral variability appears to be\naccounted for mainly by continuum slope changes, but variability in the ionized\nabsorber may also play some part. The apparently flat spectral slope with\nphoton index of 1.4 below 10 keV, obtained after correcting for absorption, is\nmarginally inconsistent with the photon index of 2 inferred from the 14-35 keV\nPIN spectrum. If the true spectral slope was as steep as that measured in the\nhard X-ray band, there would be an extra absorption component, which we are\nunable to detect. Combined with the INTEGRAL measurements, the hard X-ray\nemission above 10 keV exceeds the optical emission in terms of luminosity and\ndominates the broadband energy output, unless a large excess of UV disk\nemission is yet to be detected in the unobservable band. A weak Fe K line is\nseen at 6.4 keV with the average equivalent width of 110 eV, which does not\nshow clear flux changes over the 3-day observation.\n", "  We solve an open problem by constructing quantum walks that not only detect\nbut also find marked vertices in a graph. In the case when the marked set $M$\nconsists of a single vertex, the number of steps of the quantum walk is\nquadratically smaller than the classical hitting time $HT(P,M)$ of any\nreversible random walk $P$ on the graph. In the case of multiple marked\nelements, the number of steps is given in terms of a related quantity\n$HT^+(\\mathit{P,M})$ which we call extended hitting time.\n  Our approach is new, simpler and more general than previous ones. We\nintroduce a notion of interpolation between the random walk $P$ and the\nabsorbing walk $P'$, whose marked states are absorbing. Then our quantum walk\nis simply the quantum analogue of this interpolation. Contrary to previous\napproaches, our results remain valid when the random walk $P$ is not\nstate-transitive. We also provide algorithms in the cases when only\napproximations or bounds on parameters $p_M$ (the probability of picking a\nmarked vertex from the stationary distribution) and $HT^+(\\mathit{P,M})$ are\nknown.\n", "  We study the classical color radiation from very high energy collisions that\nproduce colored particles. In the extreme high energy limit, the classical\ncolor fields are confined to a light-shell expanding at $c$ and are associated\nwith a non-linear $\\sigma$-model on the 2D light-shell with specific symmetry\nbreaking terms. We argue that the quantum version of this picture exhibits\nasymptotic freedom and may be a useful starting point for an effective\nlight-shell theory of the structure between the jets at a very high energy\ncollider.\n", "  We present an analysis of the rms variability spectra of a sample of 18\nobservations of 14 Seyfert galaxies observed by XMM-Newton, which exhibit\nsufficient variability and signal-to-noise ratio to examine the variations in\nthe iron K-band. The narrow core of the K alpha line at 6.4 keV, seen\nuniversally in Seyferts, shows minimal evidence for variability and is always\nless variable than the continuum, supporting an origin in distant material such\nas the torus. At least half the observations do show evidence for variations in\nthe wider iron K-band, however, and in at least 5 cases the excess line\nvariations appear to be broad. The simplest prediction -- that the broad\nemission line is as variable as the continuum -- is generally not confirmed as\nonly two observations show this type of behaviour. In four cases, the red wing\nof the line is more variable than the power-law continuum and extends down to\nenergies of ~ 5 keV. Three observations show strong variability blueward of the\nline core that could also be from the disk, but alternatively might be due to\nemission or absorption by other hot or photoionised gas close to the nucleus.\nIn cases where this excess blue variability is present, it is not always seen\nin the time-averaged spectrum. Six observations possess a broad iron line in\nthe time-averaged spectra but with an invariant red wing, and three of these\nsix show no variability across the entire iron line region. This suggests a\ndecoupling of the continuum and reflection component, perhaps due to light\nbending or other anisotropic effects as has been suggested for MCG-6-30-15 and\nother narrow-line Seyfert 1s. A key result is that the rms spectra of objects\nsuch as NGC 3516 do not agree with complex absorption effects mimicking the\nbroad red wing.\n", "  Observations of the Galactic Center (GC) have accumulated a multitude of\n\"forensic\" evidence indicating that several million years ago the center of the\nMilky Way galaxy was teaming with starforming and accretion-powered activity --\nthis paints a rather different picture from the GC as we understand it today.\nWe examine a possibility that this epoch of activity could have been triggered\nby the infall of a satellite galaxy into the Milky Way which began at the\nredshift of 10 and ended few million years ago with a merger of the Galactic\nsupermassive black hole with an intermediate mass black hole brought in by the\ninspiralling satellite.\n", "  Consistently superb observing conditions are crucial for achieving the\nscientific objectives of a telescope. Submillimeter astronomy is possible only\nat a few exceptionally dry sites, notably Mauna Kea, the Antarctic plateau, and\nthe Chajnantor region in the high Andes east of San Pedro de Atacama in\nnorthern Chile. Long term measurements of 225 GHz and 350 \\mu m atmospheric\ntransparency demonstrate all three locations enjoy significant periods of\nexcellent observing conditions. Conditions on the Chajnantor plateau and at the\nSouth Pole are better more often than on Mauna Kea. Conditions are better\nduring winter and at night. Near the summit of Cerro Chajnantor, conditions are\nbetter than on the Chajnantor plateau.\n", "  By using lattice QCD computations we determine the sigma terms and\nstrangeness content of all octet baryons by means of an application of the\nHellmann-Feynman theorem. In addition to polynomial and rational expressions\nfor the quark mass dependence of octet members, we use SU(3) covariant baryon\nchiral perturbation theory to perform the extrapolation to the physical up and\ndown quark masses. Our N_f=2+1 lattice ensembles include pion masses down to\nabout 190 MeV in large volumes (M_\\pi L > 4), and three values of the lattice\nspacing. Our main results are the nucleon sigma term \\sigma_{\\pi N} =\n39(4)(^{+18}_{-7}) and the strangeness content y_{N} = 0.20(7)(^{+13}_{-17}).\nUnder the assumption of validity of covariant baryon \\chi PT in our range of\nmasses one finds y_{N} = 0.276(77)(^{+90}_{-62}).\n", "  The original formulation of BEAMS - Bayesian Estimation Applied to Multiple\nSpecies - showed how to use a dataset contaminated by points of multiple\nunderlying types to perform unbiased parameter estimation. An example is\ncosmological parameter estimation from a photometric supernova sample\ncontaminated by unknown Type Ibc and II supernovae. Where other methods require\ndata cuts to increase purity, BEAMS uses all of the data points in conjunction\nwith their probabilities of being each type. Here we extend the BEAMS formalism\nto allow for correlations between the data and the type probabilities of the\nobjects as can occur in realistic cases. We show with simple simulations that\nthis extension can be crucial, providing a 50% reduction in parameter\nestimation variance when such correlations do exist. We then go on to perform\ntests to quantify the importance of the type probabilities, one of which\nillustrates the effect of biasing the probabilities in various ways. Finally, a\ngeneral presentation of the selection bias problem is given, and discussed in\nthe context of future photometric supernova surveys and BEAMS, which lead to\nspecific recommendations for future supernova surveys.\n", "  Fix constants \\chi >0 and \\theta \\in [0,2\\pi), and let h be an instance of\nthe Gaussian free field on a planar domain. We study flow lines of the vector\nfield e^{i(h/\\chi+\\theta)} starting at a fixed boundary point of the domain.\nConsidering all \\theta \\in [0,2\\pi), one obtains a family of curves that look\nlocally like SLE_\\kappa, with \\kappa \\in (0,4), where \\chi = 2/\\kappa^{1/2} -\n\\kappa^{1/2}/2, which we interpret as the rays of a random geometry with purely\nimaginary curvature.\n  We extend the fundamental existence and uniqueness results about these paths\nto the case that the paths intersect the boundary. We also show that flow lines\nof different angles cross each other at most once but (in contrast to what\nhappens when h is smooth) may bounce off of each other after crossing. Flow\nlines of the same angle started at different points merge into each other upon\nintersecting, forming a tree structure. We construct so-called counterflow\nlines (SLE_{16/\\kappa}) within the same geometry using ordered \"light cones\" of\npoints accessible by angle-restricted trajectories and develop a robust theory\nof flow and counterflow line interaction.\n  The theory leads to new results about SLE. For example, we prove that\nSLE_\\kappa(\\rho) processes are almost surely continuous random curves, even\nwhen they intersect the boundary, and establish Duplantier duality for general\nSLE_{16/\\kappa}(\\rho) processes.\n", "  Given a simply connected planar domain D, distinct points x,y \\in \\partial D,\nand \\kappa >0, the Schramm-Loewner evolution SLE_\\kappa is a random continuous\nnon-self-crossing path in the closure of D from x to y. The\nSLE_\\kappa(\\rho_1;\\rho_2) processes, defined for \\rho_1, \\rho_2 > -2, are in\nsome sense the most natural generalizations of SLE_\\kappa.\n  When \\kappa \\leq 4, we prove that the law of the time-reversal of an\n\\SLE_\\kappa(\\rho_1;\\rho_2) from x to y is, up to parameterization, an\nSLE_\\kappa(\\rho_2;\\rho_1) from y to x. This assumes that the \"force points\"\nused to define SLE_\\kappa(\\rho_1;\\rho_2) are immediately to the left and right\nof the SLE seed. A generalization to arbitrary (and arbitrarily many) force\npoints applies whenever the path does not (or is conditioned not to) hit the\nboundary of D except at the endpoints.\n  The time-reversal symmetry has a particularly natural interpretation when the\npaths are coupled with the Gaussian free field and viewed as rays of a random\ngeometry. It allows us to couple two instances of the Gaussian free field (with\ndifferent boundary conditions) so that their difference is almost surely\nconstant on either side of the path. In a fairly general sense, adding\nappropriate constants to the two sides of a ray reverses its orientation.\n", "  Suppose that D is a planar Jordan domain and x and y are distinct boundary\npoints of D. Fix \\kappa \\in (4,8) and let \\eta\\ be an SLE_\\kappa process from x\nto y in D. We prove that the law of the time-reversal of \\eta is, up to\nreparameterization, an SLE_\\kappa process from y to x in D. More generally, we\nprove that SLE_\\kappa(\\rho_1;\\rho_2) processes are reversible if and only if\nboth \\rho_i are at least \\kappa/2-4, which is the critical threshold at or\nbelow which such curves are boundary filling.\n  Our result supplies the missing ingredient needed to show that for all \\kappa\n\\in (4,8) the so-called conformal loop ensembles CLE_\\kappa\\ are canonically\ndefined, with almost surely continuous loops. It also provides an interesting\nway to couple two Gaussian free fields (with different boundary conditions) so\nthat their difference is piecewise constant and the boundaries between the\nconstant regions are SLE_\\kappa curves.\n", "  While O is often seen in spectra of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as both\nunburned fuel and a product of C burning, C is only occasionally seen at the\nearliest times, and it represents the most direct way of investigating\nprimordial white dwarf material and its relation to SN Ia explosion scenarios\nand mechanisms. In this paper, we search for C absorption features in 188\noptical spectra of 144 low-redshift (z < 0.1) SNe Ia with ages <3.6 d after\nmaximum brightness. These data were obtained as part of the Berkeley SN Ia\nProgram (BSNIP; Silverman et al. 2012) and represent the largest set of SNe Ia\nin which C has ever been searched. We find that ~11 per cent of the SNe studied\nshow definite C absorption features while ~25 per cent show some evidence for C\nII in their spectra. Also, if one obtains a spectrum at t < -5 d, then there is\na better than 30 per cent chance of detecting a distinct absorption feature\nfrom C II. SNe Ia that show C are found to resemble those without C in many\nrespects, but objects with C tend to have bluer optical colours than those\nwithout C. The typical expansion velocity of the C II {\\lambda}6580 feature is\nmeasured to be 12,000-13,000 km/s, and the ratio of the C II {\\lambda}6580 to\nSi II {\\lambda}6355 velocities is remarkably constant with time and among\ndifferent objects with a median value of ~1.05. While the pseudo-equivalent\nwidths (pEWs) of the C II {\\lambda}6580 and C II {\\lambda}7234 features are\nfound mostly to decrease with time, we see evidence of a significant increase\nin pEW between ~12 and 11 d before maximum brightness, which is actually\npredicted by some theoretical models. The range of pEWs measured from the BSNIP\ndata implies a range of C mass in SN Ia ejecta of about (2-30) * 10^-3 M_Sun.\n", "  The Kepler mission discovery of candidate transiting exoplanets (KOIs)\nenables a plethora of ensemble analysis of the architecture and properties of\nexoplanetary systems. We compare the observed transit durations of KOIs to a\nsynthetic distribution generated from the known eccentricities of radial\nvelocity (RV) discovered exoplanets. We find that the Kepler and RV\ndistributions differ at a statistically significant level. We identify three\nrelated systematic trends that are likely due to errors in stellar radii, which\nin turn affect the inferred exoplanet radii and the distribution thereof, and\nprevent a valid analysis of the underlying ensemble eccentricity distribution.\nFirst, 15% of KOIs have transit durations >20% longer than the transit duration\nexpected for an edge-on circular orbit, including 92 KOIs with transit\ndurations >50% longer, when only a handful of such systems are expected.\nSecond, the median transit duration is too long by up to ~25%. Random errors of\n<50% in the stellar radius are not adequate to account for these two trends,\nand they are present for all spectral types in the Kepler sample. We identify\nthat incorrect estimates of stellar metallicity and extinction could account\nfor these anomalies, rather than astrophysical effects such as eccentric\nexoplanets improbably transiting near apastron. Third, we find that the median\ntransit duration is correlated with stellar radius, when no such trend is\nexpected. All three effects are still present, although less pronounced, when\nconsidering only multiple transiting KOI systems which are thought to have a\nlow false positive rate. Improved stellar parameters for KOIs are necessary for\nthe validity of future ensemble tests of exoplanetary systems found by Kepler.\n", "  We use type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) data in combination with recent baryonic\nacoustic oscillations (BAO) and cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations\nto constrain a kink-like parametrization of the deceleration parameter ($q$).\nThis $q$-parametrization can be written in terms of the initial ($q_i$) and\npresent ($q_0$) values of the deceleration parameter, the redshift of the\ncosmic transition from deceleration to acceleration ($z_t$) and the redshift\nwidth of such transition ($\\tau$). By assuming a flat space geometry, $q_i=1/2$\nand adopting a likelihood approach to deal with the SN Ia data we obtain, at\nthe 68% confidence level (C.L.), that: $z_t=0.56^{+0.13}_{-0.10}$,\n$\\tau=0.47^{+0.16}_{-0.20}$ and $q_0=-0.31^{+0.11}_{-0.11}$ when we combine\nBAO/CMB observations with SN Ia data processed with the MLCS2k2 light-curve\nfitter. When in this combination we use the SALT2 fitter we get instead, at the\nsame C.L.: $z_t=0.64^{+0.13}_{-0.07}$, $\\tau=0.36^{+0.11}_{-0.17}$ and\n$q_0=-0.53^{+0.17}_{-0.13}$. Our results indicate, with a quite general and\nmodel independent approach, that MLCS2k2 favors Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati-like\ncosmological models, while SALT2 favors $\\Lambda$CDM-like ones. Progress in\ndetermining the transition redshift and/or the present value of the\ndeceleration parameter depends crucially on solving the issue of the difference\nobtained when using these two light-curve fitters.\n", "  We estimate Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarisation power spectra, and\ntemperature-polarisation cross-spectra, from the 9-year data of the Wilkinson\nMicrowave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). Foreground cleaning is implemented using\nminimum variance linear combinations of the coefficients of needlet\ndecompositions of sky maps for all WMAP channels, to produce maps for CMB\ntemperature anisotropies (T-mode) and polarisation (E-mode and B-mode), for 9\ndifferent years of observation. The final power spectra are computed from\naverages of all possible cross-year power spectra obtained using\nforeground-cleaned maps for the different years. Our analysis technique yields\na measurement of the EE spectrum that is in excellent agreement with\ntheoretical expectations from the current cosmological model. By comparison,\nthe publicly available WMAP EE power spectrum is higher on average (and\nsignificantly higher than the predicted EE spectrum from the current best fit)\nat scales larger than about a degree, an excess that is not confirmed by our\nanalysis.\n", "  The availability of asteroseismic constraints for a large sample of stars\nfrom the missions CoRoT and Kepler paves the way for various statistical\nstudies of the seismic properties of stellar populations. In this paper, we\nevaluate the impact of rotation-induced mixing and thermohaline instability on\nthe global asteroseismic parameters at different stages of the stellar\nevolution from the Zero Age Main Sequence to the Thermally Pulsating Asymptotic\nGiant Branch to distinguish stellar populations. We present a grid of stellar\nevolutionary models for four metallicities (Z = 0.0001, 0.002, 0.004, and\n0.014) in the mass range between 0.85 to 6.0 Msun. The models are computed\neither with standard prescriptions or including both thermohaline convection\nand rotation-induced mixing. For the whole grid we provide the usual stellar\nparameters (luminosity, effective temperature, lifetimes, ...), together with\nthe global seismic parameters, i.e. the large frequency separation and\nasymptotic relations, the frequency corresponding to the maximum oscillation\npower {\\nu}_{max}, the maximal amplitude A_{max}, the asymptotic period spacing\nof g-modes, and different acoustic radii. We discuss the signature of\nrotation-induced mixing on the global asteroseismic quantities, that can be\ndetected observationally. Thermohaline mixing whose effects can be identified\nby spectroscopic studies cannot be caracterized with the global seismic\nparameters studied here. But it is not excluded that individual mode\nfrequencies or other well chosen asteroseismic quantities might help\nconstraining this mixing.\n", "  We have calculated the scattering lengths between the pseudoscalar meson and\ncharmed triplet, sextet, and excited sextet baryon to the third order with the\nheavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. The chiral expansion of the pion\nchannels converges well.\n", "  Using the OSIRIS instrument installed on the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias\n(GTC) we acquired multi-color transit photometry of four small (Rp < 5 R_Earth)\nshort-period (P < 6 days) planet candidates recently identified by the Kepler\nspace mission. These observations are part of a program to constrain the false\npositive rate for small, short-period Kepler planet candidates. Since planetary\ntransits should be largely achromatic when observed at different wavelengths\n(excluding the small color changes due to stellar limb darkening), we use the\nobserved transit color to identify candidates as either false positives (e.g.,\na blend with a stellar eclipsing binary either in the background/foreground or\nbound to the target star) or validated planets. Our results include the\nidentification of KOI 225.01 and KOI 1187.01 as false positives and the\ntentative validation of KOI 420.01 and KOI 526.01 as planets. The probability\nof identifying two false positives out of a sample of four targets is less than\n1%, assuming an overall false positive rate for Kepler planet candidates of 10%\n(as estimated by Morton & Johnson 2011). Therefore, these results suggest a\nhigher false positive rate for the small, short-period Kepler planet candidates\nthan has been theoretically predicted by other studies which consider the\nKepler planet candidate sample as a whole. Furthermore, our results are\nconsistent with a recent Doppler study of short-period giant Kepler planet\ncandidates (Santerne et al. 2012). We also investigate how the false positive\nrate for our sample varies with different planetary and stellar properties. Our\nresults suggest that the false positive rate varies significantly with orbital\nperiod and is largest at the shortest orbital periods (P < 3 days), where there\nis a corresponding rise in the number of detached eclipsing binary stars...\n(truncated)\n", "  Deep HST broad-band images taken with ACS and WFPC2 of the giant ($\\sim 1000$\nAU diameter) dark silhouette proplyd 114-426 in the Orion Nebula show that this\nsystem is tilted, asymmetric, warped and photoevaporated. The exquisite angular\nresolution of ACS allows us to map the distribution of dust grains at the\nnorthern translucent edge of the disk, dominated by the photoevaporative flow.\nUsing the Mie theory for standard circumstellar disk grains, we find evidence\nfor a spatial gradient in grain size. The typical dust radius, $\\simeq 0.2-0.7\n\\mu$m (less than what reported by previous studies) becomes smaller as the\ndistance from the disk center increases, consistent with the expectations for\nthe dynamic of dust entrained in a gaseous photoevaporative wind. Our analysis\nof the disk morphology and location within the nebula indicates that this\nsystem is photoevaporated by the diffuse radiation field of the Orion Nebula,\nwhile being shielded from the radiation coming directly from the central\nTrapezium stars. We estimate the mass-loss rate from the disk surface and the\ntime-scale for total disk dissipation, which turns out to be of the order of\n$10^4$yr. Such a short time, of the order of 1/100 of the cluster age,\nindicates that this system is seen on the verge of destruction. This is\ncompatible with the exceptional nature of the disk, namely its combination of\nhuge size and low mass. Finally, we briefly discuss the viability of possible\nmechanisms that may lead to the peculiar morphology of this system: external UV\nflux, binary star and past close encounter.\n", "  The discrete spectrum of the Laplacian has been extensively studied on\nreductive symmetric spaces and on Riemannian locally symmetric spaces. Here we\nexamine it for the first time in the general setting of non-Riemannian,\nreductive, locally symmetric spaces.\n  For any non-Riemannian, reductive symmetric space X on which the discrete\nspectrum of the Laplacian is nonempty, and for any discrete group of isometries\nGamma whose action on X is sufficiently proper, we construct L^2-eigenfunctions\nof the Laplacian on X_{Gamma}:=Gamma\\X for an infinite set of eigenvalues.\nThese eigenfunctions are obtained as generalized Poincar\\'e series, i.e. as\nprojections to X_{Gamma} of sums, over the Gamma-orbits, of eigenfunctions of\nthe Laplacian on X.\n  We prove that the Poincar\\'e series we construct still converge, and define\nnonzero L^2-functions, after any small deformation of Gamma, for a large class\nof groups Gamma. In other words, the infinite set of eigenvalues we construct\nis stable under small deformations. This contrasts with the classical setting\nwhere the nonzero discrete spectrum varies on the Teichm\\\"uller space of a\ncompact Riemann surface.\n  We actually construct joint L^2-eigenfunctions for the whole commutative\nalgebra of invariant differential operators on X_{Gamma}.\n", "  This paper presents the Suzaku results obtained for the Sagittarius (Sgr) C\nregion using the concept of X-ray reflection nebulae (XRNe) as the echo of past\nflares from the super massive black hole, Sgr A*. The Sgr C complex is composed\nof several molecular clouds proximately located in projected distance. The\nX-ray spectra of Sgr C were analyzed on the basis of a view that XRNe are\nlocated inside the Galactic center plasma X-ray emission with an oval\ndistribution around Sgr A*. We found that the XRNe are largely separated in the\nline-of-sight position, and are associated with molecular clouds in different\nvelocity ranges detected by radio observations. We also applied the same\nanalysis to the Sgr B XRNe and completed a long-term light curve for Sgr A*\noccurring in the past. As a new finding, we determined that Sgr A* was\nexperiencing periods of high luminosity already 500 years ago, which is longer\nthan the previously reported value. Our results are consistent with a scenario\nthat Sgr A* was continuously active with sporadic flux variabilities of Lx =\n1-3 x 10^39 erg s^-1 in the past 50 to 500 years. The average past luminosity\nwas approximately 4-6 orders of magnitude higher than that presently observed.\nIn addition, two short-term flares of 5-10 years are found. Thus, the past\nX-ray flare should not be a single short-term flare, but can be interpreted as\nmultiple flares superposed on a long-term high state.\n", "  This is a review article about neutrino mass and mixing and flavour model\nbuilding strategies based on discrete family symmetry. After a pedagogical\nintroduction and overview of the whole of neutrino physics, we focus on the\nPMNS mixing matrix and the latest global fits following the Daya Bay and RENO\nexperiments which measure the reactor angle. We then describe the simple\nbimaximal, tri-bimaximal and golden ratio patterns of lepton mixing and the\ndeviations required for a non-zero reactor angle, with solar or atmospheric\nmixing sum rules resulting from charged lepton corrections or residual\ntrimaximal mixing. The different types of see-saw mechanism are then reviewed\nas well as the sequential dominance mechanism. We then give a mini-review of\nfinite group theory, which may be used as a discrete family symmetry broken by\nflavons either completely, or with different subgroups preserved in the\nneutrino and charged lepton sectors. These two approaches are then reviewed in\ndetail in separate chapters including mechanisms for flavon vacuum alignment\nand different model building strategies that have been proposed to generate the\nreactor angle. We then briefly review grand unified theories (GUTs) and how\nthey may be combined with discrete family symmetry to describe all quark and\nlepton masses and mixing. Finally we discuss three model examples which combine\nan SU(5) GUT with the discrete family symmetries A4, S4 and Delta(96).\n", "  The projection construction has been used to construct semifields of odd\ncharacteristic using a field and a twisted semifield [Commutative semifields\nfrom projection mappings, Designs, Codes and Cryptography, 61 (2011),\n187--196]. We generalize this idea to a projection construction using two\ntwisted semifields to construct semifields of odd characteristic. Planar\nfunctions and semifields have a strong connection so this also constructs new\nplanar functions.\n", "  We utilize Kepler data to study the precision differential photometric\nvariability of solar-type and cooler stars at different timescales, ranging\nfrom half an hour to 3 months. We define a diagnostic that characterizes the\nmedian differential intensity change between data bins of a given timescale. We\napply the same diagnostics to SOHO data that has been rendered comparable to\nKepler. The Sun exhibits similar photometric variability on all timescales as\ncomparable solar-type stars in the Kepler field (it is not unusually quiet).\nThe previously-defined photometric \"range\" serves as our activity proxy (driven\nby starspot coverage). We revisit the fraction of comparable stars in the\nKepler field that are more active than the Sun. The exact active fraction\ndepends on what is meant by \"more active than the Sun\", and on the magnitude\nlimit of the sample of stars considered. This active fraction is between a\nquarter and a third (depending on the timescale). We argue that a reliable\nresult requires timescales of half a day or longer and stars brighter than\nKepler magnitude of 14, otherwise non-stellar noise distorts it. We also\nanalyze main sequence stars grouped by temperature from 6500-3500K. As one\nmoves to cooler stars, the active fraction of stars becomes steadily larger\n(greater than 90% for early M dwarfs). The Sun is a good photometric model at\nall timescales for those cooler stars that have long-term variability within\nthe span of solar variability.\n", "  The paper describes heterostructures spontaneously formed in PMN-PT single\ncrystals cooled under bias electric field applied along [001]pc and then\nzero-field-heated in the vicinity of the so-called depoling temperature. In\nparticular, formation of lamellar structures composed of tetragonal-like and\nrhombohedral-like layers extending over macroscopic (mm) lengths is\ndemonstrated by optical observations and polarized Raman investigations.\n", "  Radio communication over interstellar distances is studied, accounting for\nnoise, dispersion, scattering and motion. Large transmitted powers suggest\nmaximizing power efficiency (ratio of information rate to average signal power)\nas opposed to restricting bandwidth. The fundamental limit to reliable\ncommunication is determined, and is not affected by carrier frequency,\ndispersion, scattering, or motion. The available efficiency is limited by noise\nalone, and the available information rate is limited by noise and available\naverage power. A set of five design principles (well within our own\ntechnological capability) can asymptotically approach the fundamental limit; no\nother civilization can achieve greater efficiency. Bandwidth can be expanded in\na way that avoids invoking impairment by dispersion or scattering. The\nresulting power-efficient signals have characteristics very different from\ncurrent SETI targets, with wide bandwidth relative to the information rate and\na sparse distribution of energy in both time and frequency. Information-free\nbeacons achieving the lowest average power consistent with a given receiver\nobservation time are studied. They need not have wide bandwidth, but do\ndistribute energy more sparsely in time as average power is reduced. The\ndiscovery of both beacons and information-bearing signals is analyzed, and most\nclosely resembles approaches that have been employed in optical SETI. No\nprocessing is needed to account for impairments other than noise. A direct\nstatistical tradeoff between a larger number of observations and a lower\naverage power (including due to lower information rate) is established. The\n\"false alarms\" in current searches are characteristic signatures of these\nsignals. Joint searches for beacons and information-bearing signals require\nstraightforward modifications to current SETI pattern recognition approaches.\n", "  A general form factor formula for the $O(N)\\sigma$-model is constructed and\napplied to several operators. The large N limits of these form factors are\ncomputed and compared with the 1/N expansion of the $O(N)\\sigma$-model in terms\nof Feynman graphs and full agreement is found. In particular, O(3) and O(4)\nform factors are discussed. For the $O(3)\\sigma$-model several low particle\nform factors are calculated explicitly.\n", "  Microlensing observations indicate that quasar accretion discs have\nhalf-light radii larger than expected from standard theoretical predictions\nbased on quasar fluxes or black hole masses. Blackburne and colleagues have\nalso found a very weak wavelength dependence of these half-light radii. We\nconsider disc temperature profile models that might match these observations.\nNixon and colleagues have suggested that misaligned accretion discs around\nspinning black holes will be disrupted at radii small enough for the\nLense-Thirring torque to overcome the disc's viscous torque. Gas in precessing\nannuli torn off a disc will spread radially and intersect with the remaining\ndisc, heating the disc at potentially large radii. However, if the intersection\noccurs at an angle of more than a degree or so, highly supersonic collisions\nwill shock-heat the gas to a Compton temperature of T~10^7 K, and the spectral\nenergy distributions (SEDs) of discs with such shock-heated regions are poor\nfits to observations of quasar SEDs. Torn discs where heating occurs in\nintermittent weak shocks that occur whenever the intersection angle reaches a\ntenth of a degree pose less of a conflict with observations, but do not have\nsignificantly larger half-light radii than standard discs. We also study two\nphenomenological disc temperature profile models. We find that discs with a\ntemperature spike at relatively large radii and lowered temperatures at radii\ninside the spike yield improved and acceptable fits to microlensing sizes in\nmost cases. Such temperature profiles could in principle occur in sub-Keplerian\ndiscs partially supported by magnetic pressure. However, such discs overpredict\nthe fluxes from quasars studied with microlensing except in the limit of\nnegligible continuum emission from radii inside the temperature spike.\n", "  Several persistent, low luminosity (L_X 10^{34} erg s^{-1}), long spin period\n(P>100 s) High Mass X-ray Binaries have been reported with blackbody components\nwith temperatures >1 keV. These hot thermal excesses have correspondingly small\nemitting regions (<1 km^2) and are attributed to the neutron star polar caps.\nWe present a recent XMM-Newton target of opportunity observation of the newest\nmember of this class, Swift J045106.8-694803. The period was determined to be\n168.5+/-0.2 s as of 17 July 2012 (MJD = 56125.0). At $L_X 10^{36} erg s^{-1},\nSwift J045106.8-694803 is the brightest member of this new class, as well as\nthe one with the shortest period. The spectral analysis reveals for the first\ntime the presence of a blackbody with temperature kT_{BB}=1.8^{+0.2}_{-0.3} keV\nand radius R_{BB}=0.5+/-0.2 km. The pulsed fraction decreases with increasing\nenergy and the ratio between the hard (>2 keV) and soft (<2 keV) light curves\nis anticorrelated with the pulse profile. Simulations of the spectrum suggest\nthat this is caused by the pulsations of the blackbody being pi out of phase\nwith those of the power law component. Using a simple model for emission from\nhot spots on the neutron star surface, we fit the pulse profile of the\nblackbody component to obtain an indication of the geometry of the system.\n", "  The technical merits of weak value amplification techniques are analyzed. We\nconsider models of several different types of technical noise in an optical\ncontext and show that weak value amplification techniques (which only use a\nsmall fraction of the photons) compare favorably with standard techniques\n(which uses all of them). Using the Fisher information metric, we demonstrate\nthat weak value techniques can put all of the Fisher information about the\ndetected parameter into a small portion of the events and show how this fact\nalone gives technical advantages. We go on to consider a time correlated noise\nmodel, and find that a Fisher information analysis indicates that while the\nstandard method can have much larger information about the detected parameter\nthan the postselected technique. However, the estimator needed to gather the\ninformation is technically difficult to implement, showing that the inefficient\n(but practical) signal-to-noise estimation of the parameter is usually\nsuperior. We also describe other technical advantages unique to imaginary weak\nvalue amplification techniques, focusing on beam deflection measurements. In\nthis case, we discuss combined noise types (such as detector transverse jitter,\nangular beam jitter before the interferometer and turbulence) for which the\ninterferometric weak value technique gives higher Fisher information over\nconventional methods. We go on to calculate the Fisher information of the\nrecently proposed photon recycling scheme for beam deflection measurements, and\nshow it further boosts the Fisher information by the inverse postselection\nprobability relative to the standard measurement case.\n", "  This document presents the results from the Distances subgroup of the Cosmic\nFrontier Community Planning Study (Snowmass 2013). We summarize the current\nstate of the field as well as future prospects and challenges. In addition to\nthe established probes using Type IA supernovae and baryon acoustic\noscillations, we also consider prospective methods based on clusters, active\ngalactic nuclei, gravitational wave sirens and strong lensing time delays.\n", "  When traversing a symmetry breaking second order phase transition at a finite\nrate, topological defects form whose number dependence on the quench rate is\ngiven by simple power laws. We propose a general approach for the derivation of\nsuch scaling laws that is based on the analytical transformation of the\nassociated equations of motion to a universal form rather than employing\nplausible physical arguments. We demonstrate the power of this approach by\nderiving the scaling of the number of topological defects in both homogenous\nand non-homogenous settings. The general nature and extensions of this approach\nis discussed.\n", "  We took advantage of the observations carried out by XMM in the COSMOS field\nduring 3.5 years, to study the long term variability of a large sample of AGN\n(638 sources), in a wide range of redshift (0.1<z<3.5) and X-ray luminosity\n($10^{41}<$L(2-10)$<10^{45.5}$). Both a simple statistical method to asses the\nsignificance of variability, and the Normalized Excess Variance\n($\\sigma^{2}_{rms}$) parameter, where used to obtain a quantitative measurement\nof the variability. Variability is found to be prevalent in most AGN, whenever\nwe have good statistic to measure it, and no significant differences between\ntype-1 and type-2 AGN were found. A flat (slope -0.23+/-0.03) anti-correlation\nbetween $\\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and X-ray luminosity is found, when significantly\nvariable sources are considered all together. When divided in three redshift\nbins, the anti-correlation becomes stronger and evolving with z, with higher\nredshift AGN being more variable. We prove however that this effect is due to\nthe pre-selection of variable sources: considering all the sources with\navailable $\\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ measurement, the evolution in redshift disappears.\nFor the first time we were also able to study the long term X-ray variability\nas a function of $M_{\\rm BH}$ and Eddington ratio, for a large sample of AGN\nspanning a wide range of redshift. An anti-correlation between\n$\\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and $M_{\\rm BH}$ is found, with the same slope of the\nanti-correlation between $\\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and X-ray luminosity, suggesting\nthat the latter can be a byproduct of the former one. No clear correlation is\nfound between $\\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and the Eddington ratio in our sample.\nFinally, no correlation is found between the X-ray $\\sigma^{2}_{rms}$ and the\noptical variability.\n", "  We investigate net-proton fluctuations as important observables measured in\nheavy-ion collisions within the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model. Special\nemphasis is given to effects which are a priori not inherent in a thermally and\nchemically equilibrated HRG approach. In particular, we point out the\nimportance of taking into account the successive regeneration and decay of\nresonances below the chemical freeze-out, which lead to a randomization of the\nisospin of nucleons and thus to additional fluctuations in the net-proton\nnumber. We find good agreement between our model results and the recent STAR\nmeasurements of the higher-order moments of the net-proton distribution.\n", "  We search for the lensing signal of massive filaments between 135,000 pairs\nof Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We develop a\nnew estimator that cleanly removes the much larger shear signal of the\nneighboring LRG halos, relying only on the assumption of spherical symmetry. We\nconsider two models: a thick filament model constructed from ray-tracing\nsimulations for $\\Lambda$CDM model, and a thin filament model which models the\nfilament by a string of halos along the line connecting the two LRGs. We show\nthat the filament lensing signal is in nice agreement with the thick simulation\nfilament, while strongly disfavoring the thin model. The magnitude of the\nlensing shear due to the filament is below $10^{-4}$. Employing the likelihood\nratio test, we find a 4.5$\\sigma$ significance for the detection of the\nfilament lensing signal, corresponding to a null hypothesis fluctuation\nprobability of $3 \\times 10^{-6}$. We also carried out several null tests to\nverify that the residual shear signal from neighboring LRGs and other shear\nsystematics are minimized.\n", "  Pseudo-$\\epsilon$ expansions ($\\tau$-series) for critical exponents of 3D XY\nmodel describing $\\lambda$-transition in liquid helium are derived up to\n$\\tau^6$ terms. Numerical estimates extracted from the $\\tau$-series obtained\nusing Pad\\'e-Borel resummation technique, scaling relations and seven-loop\n($\\tau^7$) estimate for the Fisher exponent $\\eta$ are presented including\nthose for exponents $\\alpha$ and $\\nu$ measured in experiments with record\naccuracy. For the exponent $\\alpha$ the procedure argued to be most reliable\ngives $\\alpha= -0.0117$. This number is very close to the most accurate\nexperimental values differing appreciably from the results of numerous lattice\nand field-theoretical calculations. It signals that the pseudo-$\\epsilon$\nexpansion is a powerful tool robust enough to evaluate critical exponents with\nvery small absolute error. The arguments in favour of such a robustness are\npresented.\n", "  A general expression is introduced for the tracer diffusivity in complex\nperiodic energy landscapes with more than one distinct hop rate in two- and\nthree-dimensional diluted systems (low coverage, single-tracer limit). For\ndiffusion in two dimensions, a number of formulas are presented for complex\ncombinations of hop rates in systems with triangular, rectangular and square\nsymmetry. The formulas provide values in excellent agreement with Kinetic Monte\nCarlo simulations, concluding that the diffusion coefficient can be directly\ndetermined from the proposed expressions without performing such simulations.\nBased on the diffusion barriers obtained from first principles calculations and\na physically-meaningful estimate of the attempt frequencies, the proposed\nformulas are used to analyze the diffusion of Cu, Ag and Rb adatoms on the\nsurface and within the van der Waals (vdW) gap of a model topological\ninsulator, Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$. Considering the possibility for adsorbate\nintercalation from the terraces to the vdW gaps at morphological steps, we\ninfer that, at low coverage and room temperature: (i) a majority of the Rb\natoms bounce back at the steps and remain on the terraces, (ii) Cu atoms mostly\nintercalate into the vdW gap, the remaining fraction staying at the steps, and\n(iii) Ag atoms essentially accumulate at the steps and gradually intercalate\ninto the vdW gap. These conclusions are in good qualitative agreement with\nprevious experiments.\n", "  We report the first measurement of the lepton forward-backward asymmetry\n${\\cal A}_{\\rm FB}$ as a function of the squared four-momentum of the dilepton\nsystem, $q^2$, for the electroweak penguin process $B \\rightarrow X_s \\ell^+\n\\ell^-$ with a sum of exclusive final states, where $\\ell$ is an electron or a\nmuon and $X_s$ is a hadronic recoil system with an $s$ quark. The results are\nbased on a data sample containing $772\\times10^6$ $B\\bar{B}$ pairs recorded at\nthe $\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with the Belle detector at the KEKB $e^+ e^-$\ncollider. ${\\cal A}_{\\rm FB}$ for the inclusive $B \\rightarrow X_s \\ell^+\n\\ell^-$ is extrapolated from the sum of 10 exclusive $X_s$ states whose\ninvariant mass is less than 2 GeV/$c^2$. For $q^2 > 10.2$ GeV$^2$/$c^2$, ${\\cal\nA}_{\\rm FB} < 0$ is excluded at the 2.3$\\sigma$ level, where $\\sigma$ is the\nstandard deviation. For $q^2 < 4.3$ GeV$^2$/$c^2$, the result is within\n1.8$\\sigma$ of the Standard Model theoretical expectation.\n", "  Recent work demonstrated that breaking the up-down symmetry of tokamak flux\nsurfaces removes a constraint that limits intrinsic momentum transport, and\nhence toroidal rotation, to be small. We show, through MHD analysis, that\nellipticity is most effective at introducing up-down asymmetry throughout the\nplasma. We detail an extension to GS2, a local $\\delta f$ gyrokinetic code that\nself-consistently calculates momentum transport, to permit up-down asymmetric\nconfigurations. Tokamaks with tilted elliptical poloidal cross-sections were\nsimulated to determine nonlinear momentum transport. The results, which are\nconsistent with experiment in magnitude, suggest that a toroidal velocity\ngradient, $(\\partial u_{\\zeta i} / \\partial \\rho) / v_{th i}$, of 5% of the\ntemperature gradient, $(\\partial T_{i} / \\partial \\rho) / T_{i}$, is\nsustainable. Here $v_{th i}$ is the ion thermal speed, $u_{\\zeta i}$ is the ion\ntoroidal mean flow, $\\rho$ is the minor radial coordinate normalized to the\ntokamak minor radius, and $T_{i}$ is the ion temperature. Since other intrinsic\nmomentum transport mechanisms scale poorly to larger machines, these results\nindicate that up-down asymmetry is the most feasible method to generate the\ncurrent experimentally-measured rotation levels in reactor-sized devices.\n", "  We present results from a homogeneous analysis of the broadband 0.3-10 keV\nCCD resolution as well as of soft X-ray high-resolution grating spectra of a\nhard X-ray flux-limited sample of 26 Seyfert galaxies observed with XMM-Newton.\nOur goal is to characterise the warm absorber (WA) properties along the\nline-of-sight to the active nucleus. We significantly detect WAs in $65\\%$ of\nthe sample sources. Our results are consistent with WAs being present in at\nleast half of the Seyfert galaxies in the nearby Universe, in agreement with\nprevious estimates . We find a gap in the distribution of the ionisation\nparameter in the range $0.5<\\log\\xi<1.5$ which we interpret as a thermally\nunstable region for WA clouds. This may indicate that the warm absorber flow is\nprobably constituted by a clumpy distribution of discrete clouds rather than a\ncontinuous medium. The distribution of the WA column densities for the sources\nwith broad Fe K$\\alpha$ lines are similar to those sources which do not have\nbroadened emission lines. Therefore the detected broad Fe K$\\alpha$ emission\nlines are bonafide and not artifacts of ionised absorption in the soft X-rays.\nThe WA parameters show no correlation among themselves, with the exception of\nthe ionisation parameter versus column density. The shallow slope of the\n$\\log\\xi$ versus $\\log v_{\\rm out}$ linear regression ($0.12\\pm 0.03$) is\ninconsistent with the scaling laws predicted by radiation or\nmagneto-hydrodynamic-driven winds. Our results suggest also that WA and Ultra\nFast Outflows (UFOs) do not represent extreme manifestation of the same\nastrophysical system.\n", "  The positron flux measured near Earth shows a rise with energy beyond 30 GeV.\nWe show that this rise may be compatible with the production of positrons in $p\n\\gamma$ interactions in the jets of microquasars.\n", "  We derive a sharp bound as the quantum speed limit (QSL) for the minimal\nevolution time of quantum open systems in the non-Markovian strong-coupling\nregime with initial mixed states by considering the effects of both\nrenormalized Hamiltonian and dissipator. For a non-Markovian quantum open\nsystem, the possible evolution time between two arbitrary states is not unique,\namong the set of which we find that the minimal one and its QSL can decrease\nmore steeply by adjusting the coupling strength of the dissipator, which thus\nprovides potential improvements of efficiency in many quantum physics and\nquantum information areas.\n", "  Quasars with extremely red infrared-to-optical colours are an interesting\npopulation that can test ideas about quasar evolution as well as orientation,\nobscuration and geometric effects in the so-called AGN unified model. To\nidentify such a population we match the quasar catalogues of the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS), the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) to the\nWide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) to identify quasars with extremely\nhigh infrared-to-optical ratios. We identify 65 objects with r(AB)-W4(Vega)>14\nmag (i.e., F_nu(22um)/F_nu(r) > ~1000). This sample spans a redshift range of\n0.28<z<4.36 and has a bimodal distribution, with peaks at z~0.8 and z~2.5. It\nincludes three z>2.6 objects that are detected in the W4-band but not W1 or W2\n(i.e., W1W2-dropouts). The SDSS/BOSS spectra show that the majority of the\nobjects are reddened Type 1 quasars, Type 2 quasars (both at low and high\nredshift) or objects with deep low-ionization broad absorption lines (BALs)\nthat suppress the observed r-band flux. In addition, we identify a class of\nType 1 permitted broad-emission line objects at z~2-3 which are characterized\nby emission line rest-frame equivalent widths (REWs) of >~150Ang , much larger\nthan those of typical quasars. In particular, 55% (45%) of the non-BAL Type 1s\nwith measurable CIV in our sample have REW(CIV) > 100 (150)Ang, compared to\nonly 5.8% (1.3%) for non-BAL quasars in BOSS. These objects often also have\nunusual line ratios, such as very high NV/Ly-alpha ratios. These large REWs\nmight be caused by suppressed continuum emission analogous to Type 2 quasars;\nhowever, there is no obvious mechanism in standard Unified Models to suppress\nthe continuum without also obscuring the broad emission lines.\n", "  We investigate the behavior of stocks in daily price-limited stock markets by\npurposing a quantum spatial-periodic harmonic model. The stock price is\npresumed to oscillate and damp in a quantum spatial-periodic harmonic\noscillator potential well. Complicated non-linear relations including\ninter-band positive correlation and intra-band negative correlation between the\nvolatility and the trading volume of stocks are derived by considering the\nenergy band structure of the model. The validity of price limitation is then\nexamined and abnormal phenomena of a price-limited stock market (Shanghai Stock\nExchange) of China are studied by applying our quantum model.\n", "  We derive an analytical formula for the covariance $\\mathrm{Cov}(A,B)$ of two\nsmooth linear statistics $A=\\sum_i a(\\lambda_i)$ and $B=\\sum_i b(\\lambda_i)$ to\nleading order for $N\\to\\infty$, where $\\{\\lambda_i\\}$ are the $N$ real\neigenvalues of a general one-cut random-matrix model with Dyson index $\\beta$.\nThe formula, carrying the universal $1/\\beta$ prefactor, depends on the\nrandom-matrix ensemble only through the edge points $[\\lambda_-,\\lambda_+]$ of\nthe limiting spectral density. For $A=B$, we recover in some special cases the\nclassical variance formulas by Beenakker and Dyson-Mehta, clarifying the\nrespective ranges of applicability. Some choices of $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ lead to a\nstriking \\emph{decorrelation} of the corresponding linear statistics. We\nprovide two applications - the joint statistics of conductance and shot noise\nin ideal chaotic cavities, and some new fluctuation relations for traces of\npowers of random matrices.\n", "  Barred galaxies have interesting morphological features whose presence and\nproperties set constraints on galactic evolution. Here we examine barlenses,\ni.e. lens-like components whose extent along the bar major axis is shorter than\nthat of the bar and whose outline is oval or circular. We identify and analyse\nbarlenses in $N$-body plus SPH simulations, compare them extensively with those\nfrom the NIRS0S (Near-IR S0 galaxy survey) and the S$^4$G samples (Spitzer\nSurvey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies) and find very good agreement. We\nobserve barlenses in our simulations from different viewing angles. This\nreveals that barlenses are the vertically thick part of the bar seen face-on,\ni.e. a barlens seen edge-on is a boxy/peanut/X bulge. In morphological studies,\nand in the absence of kinematics or photometry, a barlens, or part of it, may\nbe mistaken for a classical bulge. Thus the true importance of classical\nbulges, both in numbers and mass, is smaller than currently assumed, which has\nimplications for galaxy formation studies. Finally, using the shape of the\nisodensity curves, we propose a rule of thumb for measuring the barlens extent\nalong the bar major axis of moderately inclined galaxies, thus providing an\nestimate of which part of the bar is thicker.\n", "  In a popular class of models, dark matter comprises an asymmetric population\nof composite particles with short range interactions arising from a confined\nnonabelian gauge group. We show that coupling this sector to a well-motivated\nlight mediator particle yields efficient darkleosynthesis, a dark-sector\nversion of big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), in generic regions of parameter\nspace. Dark matter self-interaction bounds typically require the confinement\nscale to be above \\Lambda_{QCD}, which generically yields large\n(>>MeV/dark-nucleon) binding energies. These bounds further suggest the\nmediator is relatively weakly coupled, so repulsive forces between dark-sector\nnuclei are much weaker than coulomb repulsion between standard-model nuclei,\nwhich results in an exponential barrier-tunneling enhancement over standard\nBBN. Thus, dark nuclei are easier to make and harder to break than visible\nspecies with comparable mass numbers. This process can efficiently yield a\ndominant population of states with masses significantly greater than the\nconfinement scale and, in contrast to dark matter that is a fundamental\nparticle, may allow the dominant form of dark matter to have high spin > 3/2.\n", "  We present the observation of doubly-produced $J/\\psi$ mesons with the D0\ndetector at Fermilab in $p\\bar{p}$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s}=1.96$ TeV. The\nproduction cross section for both singly and doubly-produced $J/\\psi$ mesons is\nmeasured using a sample with an integrated luminosity of 8.1fb$^{-1}$. For the\nfirst time, the double $J/\\psi$ production cross section is separated into\ncontributions due to single and double parton scatterings.\n  Using these measurements, we determine the effective cross section\n$\\sigma_{eff}$, a parameter characterizing an effective spatial area of the\nparton-parton interactions and related to the parton spatial density inside the\nnucleon.\n", "  A method to avoid the explicit time integration of small dust grains in the\ntwo fluid gas/dust smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) approach is proposed.\nBy assuming a very simple exponential decay model for the relative velocity\nbetween the gas and dust components, all the effective characteristics of the\ndrag force can be reproduced. A series of tests has been performed to compare\nthe accuracy of the method with analytical and explicit integration results. We\nfind that the method performs well on a wide range of tests, and can provide\nlarge speed ups over explicit integration when the dust stopping time is small.\nWe have also found that the method is much less dissipative than conventional\nexplicit or implicit two-fluid SPH approaches when modelling dusty shocks.\n", "  In cold astrophysical environments, some molecules are observed in the gas\nphase whereas they should have been depleted, frozen on dust grains. In order\nto solve this problem, astrochemists have proposed that a fraction of molecules\nsynthesized on the surface of dust grains could desorb just after their\nformation. Recently the chemical desorption process has been demonstrated\nexperimentally, but the key parameters at play have not yet been fully\nunderstood. In this article we propose a new procedure to analyze the ratio of\ndi-oxygen and ozone synthesized after O atoms adsorption on oxidized graphite.\nWe demonstrate that the chemical desorption efficiency of the two reaction\npaths (O+O and O+O$_2$) is different by one order of magnitude. We show the\nimportance of the surface coverage: for the O+O reaction, the chemical\ndesorption efficiency is close to 80 $\\%$ at zero coverage and tends to zero at\none monolayer coverage. The coverage dependence of O+O chemical desorption is\nproved by varying the amount of pre-adsorbed N$_2$ on the substrate from 0 to\n1.5 ML. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the different physical parameters\nthat could play a role in the chemical desorption process: binding energy,\nenthalpy of formation, and energy transfer from the new molecule to the surface\nor to other adsorbates.\n", "  Biomedical taxonomies, thesauri and ontologies in the form of the\nInternational Classification of Diseases (ICD) as a taxonomy or the National\nCancer Institute Thesaurus as an OWL-based ontology, play a critical role in\nacquiring, representing and processing information about human health. With\nincreasing adoption and relevance, biomedical ontologies have also\nsignificantly increased in size. For example, the 11th revision of the ICD,\nwhich is currently under active development by the WHO contains nearly 50,000\nclasses representing a vast variety of different diseases and causes of death.\nThis evolution in terms of size was accompanied by an evolution in the way\nontologies are engineered. Because no single individual has the expertise to\ndevelop such large-scale ontologies, ontology-engineering projects have evolved\nfrom small-scale efforts involving just a few domain experts to large-scale\nprojects that require effective collaboration between dozens or even hundreds\nof experts, practitioners and other stakeholders. Understanding how these\nstakeholders collaborate will enable us to improve editing environments that\nsupport such collaborations. We uncover how large ontology-engineering\nprojects, such as the ICD in its 11th revision, unfold by analyzing usage logs\nof five different biomedical ontology-engineering projects of varying sizes and\nscopes using Markov chains. We discover intriguing interaction patterns (e.g.,\nwhich properties users subsequently change) that suggest that large\ncollaborative ontology-engineering projects are governed by a few general\nprinciples that determine and drive development. From our analysis, we identify\ncommonalities and differences between different projects that have implications\nfor project managers, ontology editors, developers and contributors working on\ncollaborative ontology-engineering projects and tools in the biomedical domain.\n", "  Exclusive electroproduction of $\\omega$ mesons on unpolarized hydrogen and\ndeuterium targets is studied in the kinematic region of Q$^2$>1.0 GeV$^2$, 3.0\nGeV < W < 6.3 GeV, and -t'< 0.2 GeV$^2$. Results on the angular distribution of\nthe $\\omega$ meson, including its decay products, are presented. The data were\naccumulated with the HERMES forward spectrometer during the 1996-2007 running\nperiod using the 27.6 GeV longitudinally polarized electron or positron beam of\nHERA. The determination of the virtual-photon longitudinal-to-transverse\ncross-section ratio reveals that a considerable part of the cross section\narises from transversely polarized photons. Spin density matrix elements are\npresented in projections of Q$^2$ or -t'. Violation of s-channel helicity\nconservation is observed for some of these elements. A sizable contribution\nfrom unnatural-parity-exchange amplitudes is found and the phase shift between\nthose amplitudes that describe transverse $\\omega$ production by longitudinal\nand transverse virtual photons, $\\gamma^{*}_{L} \\to \\omega_{T}$ and\n$\\gamma^{*}_{T} \\to \\omega_{T}$, is determined for the first time. A hierarchy\nof helicity amplitudes is established, which mainly means that the\nunnatural-parity-exchange amplitude describing the $\\gamma^*_T \\to \\omega_T$\ntransition dominates over the two natural-parity-exchange amplitudes describing\nthe $\\gamma^*_L \\to \\omega_L$ and $\\gamma^*_T \\to \\omega_T$ transitions, with\nthe latter two being of similar magnitude. Good agreement is found between the\nHERMES proton data and results of a pQCD-inspired phenomenological model that\nincludes pion-pole contributions, which are of unnatural parity.\n", "  We present a generalization of the diagrammatic pump-probe approach to\ncoherent backscattering (CBS) of intense laser light for atoms with degenerate\nenergy levels. We employ this approach for a characterization of the double\nscattering signal from optically pumped atoms with the transition\n$J_g\\rightarrow J_e=J_g+1$ in the helicity preserving polarization channel. We\nshow that, in the saturation regime, the internal degeneracy becomes manifest\nfor atoms with $J_g\\geq 1$, leading to a faster decrease of the CBS enhancement\nfactor with increasing saturation parameter than in the non-degenerate case.\n", "  In the AdS/CFT correspondence, CFTs are identified by asymptotic boundary\nsurfaces and the boundary conditions imposed on those surfaces. However, AdS\ncan be foliated in various ways to give different boundaries. We show that the\nCFTs obtained using certain distinct foliations are different. This difference\narises because the asymptotic region of a foliation overlaps with the deep\ninterior region of another. In particular we focus on the CFTs defined on\nsurfaces of large constant radius in global coordinates, Rindler-AdS\ncoordinates, and Poincar\\'e coordinates for AdS$_3$. We refer to these as\nglobal-CFT, Rindler-CFT and Poincar\\'e-CFT respectively. We demonstrate that\nthe correlators for these CFTs are different and argue that the bulk duals to\nthese should agree up to very close to the respective horizons but then start\ndiffering. Since the BTZ black hole is obtained as a quotient of AdS$_3$, we\ndiscuss the implications of our results for bulk duals of\nperiodically-identified Poincar\\'e and Rindler-CFTs. Our results are consistent\nwith some recent proposals suggesting a modification of the semi-classical BTZ\ngeometry close to the horizons.\n", "  Millisecond pulsars have been discussed as a possible source of the gamma-ray\nexcess observed from the region surrounding the Galactic Center. With this in\nmind, we use the observed population of bright low-mass X-ray binaries to\nestimate the number of millisecond pulsars in the Inner Galaxy. This\ncalculation suggests that only ~1-5% of the excess is produced by millisecond\npulsars. We also use the luminosity function derived from local measurements of\nmillisecond pulsars, along with the number of point sources resolved by Fermi,\nto calculate an upper limit for the diffuse emission from such a population.\nWhile this limit is compatible with the millisecond pulsar population implied\nby the number of low-mass X-ray binaries, it strongly excludes the possibility\nthat most of the excess originates from such objects.\n", "  We develop a general quantum theory of the coupled plasmonic modes resulting\nfrom the near-field interaction between localized surface plasmons in a\nheterogeneous metallic nanoparticle dimer. In particular, we provide analytical\nexpressions for the frequencies and decay rates of the bright and dark\nplasmonic modes. We show that, for sufficiently small nanoparticles, the main\ndecay channel for the dark plasmonic mode, which is weakly coupled to light\nand, hence, immune to radiation damping, is of nonradiative origin and\ncorresponds to Landau damping, i.e., decay into electron-hole pairs.\n", "  We report the magnetoresistance of a charge-density wave (CDW) in $o$-TaS$_3$\nwhiskers at 4.2 K under a magnetic field up to 5.2 T. An anisotropic negative\nmagnetoresistance is found in the nonlinear regime of current-voltage\ncharacteristics. The angle dependence of the magnetoresistance, studied by\nrotating the magnetic field upon the $c$-axis, exhibited a two-fold symmetry.\nThe magnetoresistance amplitude exhibits maxima when the field is parallel to\nthe $a$-axis, whereas it vanishes to the $b$-axis. The observed anisotropy may\ncome from difference in interchain coupling of adjacent CDWs along the $a$- and\n$b$-axes. Comparison of the anisotropy to the scanning tunneling microscope\nimage of CDWs allows us to provide a simple picture to explain the\nmagnetoresistance in terms of delocalization of quantum interference of CDWs\nextending over the $b$-$c$ plane.\n", "  The feasibility of trust-free long-haul quantum key distribution (QKD)\nnetworks is addressed. We combine measurement-device-independent QKD (MDI-QKD),\nas an access technology, with a quantum repeater setup, at the core of future\nquantum communication networks. This will provide a quantum link none of whose\nintermediary nodes need to be trusted, or, in our terminology, a trust-free QKD\nlink. As the main figure of merit, we calculate the secret key generation rate\nwhen a particular probabilistic quantum repeater protocol is in use. We assume\nthe users are equipped with imperfect single photon sources, which can possibly\nemit two single photons, or laser sources to implement decoy-state techniques.\nWe consider apparatus imperfection, such as quantum efficiency and dark count\nof photodetectors, path loss of the channel, and writing and reading\nefficiencies of quantum memories. By optimizing different system parameters, we\nestimate the maximum distance over which users can share secret keys when a\nfinite number of memories are employed in the repeater setup.\n", "  Using analytic calculations, the effects of the edge flux surface shape and\nthe toroidal current profile on the penetration of flux surface shaping are\ninvestigated in a tokamak. It is shown that the penetration of shaping is\ndetermined by the poloidal variation of the poloidal magnetic field on the\nsurface. This fact is used to investigate how different flux surface shapes\npenetrate from the edge. Then, a technique to separate the effects of magnetic\npressure and tension in the Grad-Shafranov equation is presented and used to\ncalculate radial profiles of strong elongation for nearly constant current\nprofiles. Lastly, it is shown that more hollow toroidal current profiles are\nsignificantly better at conveying shaping from the edge to the core.\n", "  We give new results concerning the Frobenius integrability and solution of\nevolution equations admitting travelling wave solutions. In particular, we give\na powerful result which explains the extraordinary integrability of some of\nthese equations. We also discuss \"local\" conservations laws for evolution\nequations in general and demonstrate all the results for the Korteweg de Vries\nequation.\n", "  Thermodynamics has recently been extended to small scales with resource\ntheories that model heat exchanges. Real physical systems exchange diverse\nquantities: heat, particles, angular momentum, etc. We generalize thermodynamic\nresource theories to exchanges of observables other than heat, to baths other\nthan heat baths, and to free energies other than the Helmholtz free energy.\nThese generalizations are illustrated with \"grand-potential\" theories that\nmodel movements of heat and particles. Free operations include unitaries that\nconserve energy and particle number. From this conservation law and from\nresource-theory principles, the grand-canonical form of the free states is\nderived. States are shown to form a quasiorder characterized by free\noperations, d-majorization, the hypothesis-testing entropy, and rescaled Lorenz\ncurves. We calculate the work distillable from, and we bound the work cost of\ncreating, a state. These work quantities can differ but converge to the grand\npotential in the thermodynamic limit. Extending thermodynamic resource theories\nbeyond heat baths, we open diverse realistic systems to modeling with one-shot\nstatistical mechanics. Prospective applications such as electrochemical\nbatteries are hoped to bridge one-shot theory to experiments.\n", "  Probability distributions can be read as simple expressions of information.\nEach continuous probability distribution describes how information changes with\nmagnitude. Once one learns to read a probability distribution as a measurement\nscale of information, opportunities arise to understand the processes that\ngenerate the commonly observed patterns. Probability expressions may be parsed\ninto four components: the dissipation of all information, except the\npreservation of average values, taken over the measurement scale that relates\nchanges in observed values to changes in information, and the transformation\nfrom the underlying scale on which information dissipates to alternative scales\non which probability pattern may be expressed. Information invariances set the\ncommonly observed measurement scales and the relations between them. In\nparticular, a measurement scale for information is defined by its invariance to\nspecific transformations of underlying values into measurable outputs.\nEssentially all common distributions can be understood within this simple\nframework of information invariance and measurement scale.\n", "  Asymptotic analytic solutions of the Dirac equation, giving the scattering\nmodes (of the continuous energy spectrum, $E>mc^2$) in Schwarzschild's chart\nand Cartesian gauge, are used for building the partial wave analysis of Dirac\nfermions scattered by black holes. The contribution of the bound states to\nabsorption and possible resonant scattering is neglected because of some\ntechnical difficulties related to the discrete spectrum that is less studied so\nfar. In this framework, the analytic expressions of the differential cross\nsection and induced polarization degree are derived in terms of scattering\nangle, mass of the black hole, energy and mass of the fermion. Moreover, the\nclosed form of the absorption cross section due to the scattering modes is\nderived showing that in the high-energy limit this tends to the event horizon\narea regardless of the fermion mass (including zero). A graphical study\npresents the differential cross section analyzing the forward/backward\nscattering (known also as glory scattering) and the polarization degree as\nfunctions of scattering angle. The graphical analysis shows the presence of\noscillations in scattering intensity around forward/backward directions,\nphenomena known as spiral scattering. The energy dependence of the differential\ncross section is also established by using analytical and graphical methods.\n", "  Motivated by experiments in bosonic mixtures composed of a single element in\ntwo different hyperfine states, we study bosonic binary mixtures in the\npresence of Josephson interactions between species. We focus on a particular\nmodel with $O(2)$ isospin symmetry, lifted by an imbalanced population\nparametrized by a Rabi frequency, $\\Omega _{R}$, and a detuning, $\\nu $, which\ncouples the phases of both species. We have studied the model at mean-field\napproximation plus Gaussian fluctuations. We have found that both species\nsimultaneously condensate below a critical temperature $T_{c}$ and the relative\nphases are locked by the applied laser phase, $\\alpha$. Moreover, the\ncondensate fractions are strongly dependent on the ratio $\\Omega _{R}/|\\nu |$\nthat is not affected by thermal fluctuations.\n", "  An updated measurement of the single top quark production cross section is\npresented using the full data set collected by the Collider Detector at\nFermilab (CDF) and corresponding to 9.5 fb${}^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity\nfrom proton-antiproton collisions at 1.96 TeV center-of-mass energy. The events\nselected contain an imbalance in the total transverse energy, jets identified\nas originating from $b$ quarks, and no identified leptons. The sum of the $s$-\nand $t$-channel single top quark cross sections is measured to be\n$3.53_{-1.16}^{+1.25}$ pb and a lower limit on $V_{tb}$ of 0.63 is obtained at\nthe 95% credibility level. These measurements are combined with previously\nreported CDF results obtained from events with an imbalance in total transverse\nenergy, jets identified as originating from $b$ quarks, and exactly one\nidentified lepton. The combined cross section is measured to be\n$3.02_{-0.48}^{+0.49}$ pb and a lower limit on $V{tb}$ of 0.84 is obtained at\nthe 95% credibility level.\n", "  We translate Penrose's singularity theorem to a Finsler spacetime. To that\nend, causal concepts in Lorentzian geometry are extended, including definitions\nand properties of focal points and trapped surfaces, with careful attention\npaid to the differences that arise in the Finslerian setting.\n", "  Monte Carlo simulations are a powerful tool for elucidating the properties of\ncomplex systems across many disciplines. Not requiring any a priori knowledge,\nthey are particularly well suited for exploring new phenomena. However, when\napplied to fermionic quantum systems, quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithms\nsuffer from the so-called \"negative sign problem\", which causes the\ncomputational effort to grow exponentially with problem size. Here we\ndemonstrate that the fermion sign problem originates in topological properties\nof the configurations. In particular, we show that in the widely used auxiliary\nfield approaches the negative sign of a configuration is a geometric phase that\nis the imaginary time counterpart of the Aharonov-Anandan phase, and reduces to\na Berry phase in the adiabatic limit. This provides an intriguing connection\nbetween QMC simulations and classification of topological states. Our results\nshed clarify the controversially debated origin of the sign problem in\nfermionic lattice models.\n", "  Since their spectacular experimental realisation in the early 80's,\nquasicrystals have been the subject of very active research, whose domains\nextend far beyond the scope of solid state physics. In optics, for instance,\nphotonic quasicrystals have attracted strong interest for their specific\nbehaviour, induced by the particular spectral properties, in light transport,\nplasmonic and laser action. Very recently, one of the most salient spectral\nfeature of quasicrystals, namely the gap labelling, has been observed for a\npolariton gas confined in a one dimensional quasi-periodic cavity. This\nexperimental result confirms a theory which is now very complete in dimension\none. In dimension greater than one, the theory is very far from being complete.\nFurthermore, some intriguing phenomena, like the existence of self-similar\neigenmodes can occur. All this makes two dimensional experimental realisations\nand numerical simulations pertinent and attractive. Here, we report on\nmeasurements and energy-scaling analysis of the gap labelling and the spatial\nintensity distribution of the eigenstates for a microwave Penrose-tiled\nquasicrystal. Far from being restricted to the microwave system under\nconsideration, our results apply to a more general class of systems.\n", "  In a previous work, exact formulae and differential equations were found for\ntraces of powers of the zero mode in the W3 algebra. In this paper we\ninvestigate their modular properties, in particular we find the exact result\nfor the modular transformations of traces of $W_0^n$ for n = 1, 2, 3, solving\nexactly the problem studied approximately by Gaberdiel, Hartman and Jin. We\nalso find modular differential equations satisfied by traces with a single\n$W_0$ inserted, and relate them to differential equations studied by Mathur et\nal. We find that, remarkably, these all seem to be related to weight 0 modular\nforms with expansions with non-negative integer coefficients.\n", "  We study translational, breathing and twisting resonant modes of transverse\nmagnetic domain walls pinned at notches in ferromagnetic nanostrips. We\ndemonstrate that a mode's sensitivity to notches depends strongly on the\ncharacteristics of that particular resonance. For example, the frequencies of\nmodes involving lateral motion of the wall are the ones which are most\nsensitive to changes in the notch intrusion depth (especially at the narrower,\nmore strongly confined end of the domain wall). In contrast, the breathing\nmode, whose dynamics are concentrated away from the notches is relatively\ninsensitive to changes in the notches' sizes. We also demonstrate a sharp drop\nin the translational mode's frequency towards zero when approaching depinning\nwhich is found, using a harmonic oscillator model, to be consistent with a\nreduction in the local slope of the notch-induced confining potential at its\nedge.\n", "  The long-standing issue of the competition between the magnetic field and the\nKondo effect, favoring, respectively, triplet and singlet ground states is\naddressed using a cluster slave-rotor mean field theory for the Hubbard model\nand its spin-correlated, spin-frustrated extensions in 2 dimension. The\nmetamagnetic jump is established and compared with earlier results of dynamical\nmean-field theory. The present approach also reproduces the emergent\nsuper-exchange energy scale in the insulating side. A scaling is found for the\ncritical Zeeman field in terms of the intrinsic coherence scale just below the\nmetal-insulator transition where the critical spin fluctuations are soft. The\nconditions for metamagnetism to appear at a reasonable field are also\nunderlined. The Gutzwiller analysis on the 2D Hubbard model and a quantum Monte\nCarlo calculation on the Heisenberg spin system are performed to check the\nlimiting cases of the cluster slave-rotor results for the Hubbard model.\nLow-field scaling features for magnetization are discussed.\n", "  We study thermodynamic properties as well as the dynamical spin and\nquadrupolar structure factors of the O(3)-symmetric spin-1 Heisenberg model\nwith bilinear-biquadratic exchange interactions on the triangular lattice.\nBased on a sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo approach, we access both the\nferromagnetic and the ferroquadrupolar ordered, spin nematic phase as well as\nthe SU(3)-symmetric point which separates these phases. Signatures of Goldstone\nsoft-modes in the dynamical spin and the quadrupolar structure factors are\nidentified, and the properties of the low-energy excitations are compared to\nthe thermodynamic behavior observed at finite temperatures as well as to\nSchwinger-boson flavor-wave theory.\n", "  For an accurate treatment of the shock wave propagation in high-energy\nastrophysical phenomena, such as supernova shock breakouts, gamma-ray bursts\nand accretion disks, knowledge of radiative transfer plays a crucial role. In\nthis paper we consider one-dimensional (1D) special relativistic radiation\nhydrodynamics by solving the Boltzmann equation for radiative transfer. The\nstructure of a radiative shock is calculated for a number of shock tube\nproblems, including strong shock waves, and relativistic- and\nradiation-dominated cases. Calculations are performed using an iterative\ntechnique that consistently solves the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics\nand relativistic comoving radiative transfer. A comparison of radiative\ntransfer solutions with the Eddington approximation and the M1 closure is made.\nA qualitative analysis of moment equations for radiation is performed and the\nconditions for the existence of jump discontinuity for non-relativistic cases\nare investigated numerically.\n", "  We propose and demonstrate a test of Lorentz symmetry based on new, compact,\nand reliable quartz oscillator technology. Violations of Lorentz invariance in\nthe matter and photon-sector of the standard model extension (SME) generate\nanisotropies in particles' inertial masses and the elastic constants, giving\nrise to measurable anisotopies in the resonance frequencies of acoustic modes\nin solids. A first realization of such a \"phonon-sector\" test of Lorentz\nsymmetry using room-temperature SC-cut crystals provides a limit of $\\tilde\nc_Q^{\\rm n}=(-1.8 \\pm 2.2)\\times 10^{-14}$\\,GeV on the most weakly constrained\nneutron-sector $c-$coefficient of the SME. Future experiments with cryogenic\noscillators promise significant improvements in accuracy, opening up the\npotential for improved limits on Lorentz violation in the neutron, proton,\nelectron and photon sector.\n", "  Language learners must learn the meanings of many thousands of words, despite\nthose words occurring in complex environments in which infinitely many meanings\nmight be inferred by the learner as a word's true meaning. This problem of\ninfinite referential uncertainty is often attributed to Willard Van Orman\nQuine. We provide a mathematical formalisation of an ideal cross-situational\nlearner attempting to learn under infinite referential uncertainty, and\nidentify conditions under which word learning is possible. As Quine's\nintuitions suggest, learning under infinite uncertainty is in fact possible,\nprovided that learners have some means of ranking candidate word meanings in\nterms of their plausibility; furthermore, our analysis shows that this ranking\ncould in fact be exceedingly weak, implying that constraints which allow\nlearners to infer the plausibility of candidate word meanings could themselves\nbe weak. This approach lifts the burden of explanation from `smart' word\nlearning constraints in learners, and suggests a programme of research into\nweak, unreliable, probabilistic constraints on the inference of word meaning in\nreal word learners.\n", "  A weak parallel Zeeman field combined with the spin-orbit coupling can induce\nthe supercurrent in an s-wave two-dimensional superconductor. At the same time,\nthe thermodynamically equilibrium state of such a system is characterized by\nthe helix phase where the order parameter varies in space as\n$\\exp(i\\mathbf{Qr})$. In this state the electric current that is induced by the\nZeeman interaction is exactly counterbalanced by the current produced by the\ngradient of the order-parameter. We studied the interplay of the helix state\nand magnetoelectric current in the case of a varying in space Zeeman field, as\nit might be realized in hybrid heterostructures with magnetic and\nsuperconducting layers. The theoretical analysis was based on Usadel equations\nfor Green functions in a dirty superconductor. It is shown that even a weak\ninhomogeneity produces a strong long-range effect on the magnetoelectric\ncurrent and the order-parameter phase. Consequently, depending on the\nmacroscopic shape of such an inhomogeneity, either the helix state with the\nzero supercurrent, or a locally uniform state with the finite supercurrent are\nrealized. A mixture of these two extreme situations is also possible. It is\nalso shown that the current can be induced at a large distance from a\nferromagnetic island embedded into a superconductor. Quantum effects associated\nwith the magnetoelectric effect are briefly discussed for multiply connected\nsystems. The theory proposes a new point of view on interplay of the\nmagnetoelectric effect and helix phase in spin-orbit coupled superconductors.\nIt also suggests an interesting method allowing to couple superconducting and\nmagnetic circuits.\n", "  We present a new method of tracking and characterizing the environment in\nwhich galaxies and their associated circumgalactic medium evolve. We use a\nstructure finding algorithm we developed to self-consistently parse and follow\nthe evolution of poor clusters, filaments and voids in large scale simulations.\nWe trace the complete evolution of the baryons in the gas phase and the star\nformation history within each structure in our simulated volume. We vary the\nstructure measure threshold to probe the complex inner structure of star\nforming regions in poor clusters, filaments and voids. We find the majority of\nstar formation occurs in cold, condensed gas in filaments at intermediate\nredshifts (z ~ 3). We also show that much of the star formation above a\nredshift z = 3 occurs in low contrast regions of filaments, but as the density\ncontrast increases at lower redshift star formation switches to the high\ncontrast regions, or inner parts, of filaments. Since filaments bridge the void\nand cluster regions, it suggests that the majority of star formation occurs in\ngalaxies in intermediate density regions prior to the accretion onto poor\nclusters. We find that at the present epoch, the gas phase distribution is\n43.1%, 30.0%, 24.7% and 2.2% in the diffuse, WHIM, hot halo and condensed\nphases, respectively. The majority of the WHIM is associated with filaments.\nHowever, their multiphase nature and the fact that the star formation occurs\npredominantly in the condensed gas both point to the importance of not\nconflating the filamentary environment with the WHIM. Moreover, in our\nsimulation volume 8.77%, 79.1%, 2.11% of the gas at z = 0 is located in poor\nclusters, filaments, and voids, respectively. We find that both filaments and\npoor clusters are multiphase environments distinguishing themselves by\ndifferent distribution of gas phases.\n", "  Effective gravitational field equations on a brane have been derived, when\nthe bulk spacetime is endowed with the second rank antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond\nfield. Since both the graviton and the Kalb-Ramond field are closed string\nexcitations, they can propagate in the bulk. After deriving the effective\ngravitational field equations on the brane, we solve them for a static\nspherically symmetric solution. It turns out that the solution so obtained\nrepresents a black hole or naked singularity depending on the parameter space\nof the model. The stability of this model is also discussed. Cosmological\nsolutions to the gravitational field equations have been obtained, where the\nKalb-Ramond field is found to behave as normal pressure free matter. For\ncertain specific choices of the parameters in the cosmological solution, the\nsolution exhibits a transition in the behaviour of the scale factor and hence a\ntransition in the expansion history of the universe. The possibility of\naccelerated expansion of the universe in this scenario is also discussed.\n", "  Allowing for scale dependence of the gravitational couplings leads to a\ngeneralization of the corresponding field equations. In this work, those\nequations are solved for the Einstein-Hilbert and the Einstein-Maxwell case,\nleading to generalizations of the (Anti)-de Sitter and the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om\nblack holes. Those solutions are discussed and compared to their classical\ncounterparts.\n", "  We propose a generalization of Yang-Mills theory for which the symmetry\nalgebra does not have to be factorized as mutually commuting algebras of a\nfinite-dimensional Lie algebra and the algebra of functions on base space. The\nalgebra of diffeomorphism can be constructed as an example, and a class of\ngravity theories can be interpreted as generalized Yang-Mills theories. These\ntheories in general include a graviton, a dilaton and a rank-2 antisymmetric\nfield, although Einstein gravity is also included as a special case. We present\ncalculations suggesting that the connection in scattering amplitudes between\nYang-Mills theory and gravity via BCJ duality can be made more manifest in this\nformulation.\n", "  Combinatorial optimization problems are computationally hard in general, but\nthey are ubiquitous in our modern life. A coherent Ising machine (CIM) based on\na multiple-pulse degenerate optical parametric oscillator (DOPO) is an\nalternative approach to solve these problems by a specialized physical\ncomputing system. To evaluate its potential performance, computational\nexperiments are performed on maximum cut (MAX-CUT) problems against traditional\nalgorithms such as semidefinite programming relaxation of Goemans-Williamson\nand simulated annealing by Kirkpatrick, et al. The numerical results\nempirically suggest that the almost constant computation time is required to\nobtain the reasonably accurate solutions of MAX-CUT problems on a CIM with the\nnumber of vertices up to $2 \\times 10^4$ and the number of edges up to $10^8$.\n", "  In classical kinetic or kinetic-like models a particle free path distribution\nis exponensial, but this is more likely to be an exception than a rule. In this\npaper we derive a linear Boltzmann-like equation for a general free path\ndistribution in the framework of Alt's model J. Math. Biol. 9:147 (1980). In\nthe special case that the free path distribution has at least first and second\nfinite moments we construct an asymptotic solution of the equation for small\nmean free paths. The asymptotic solution becomes a diffusion approximation to\nthe one-speed Boltzmann-like equation.\n", "  In this paper the normal collision of spherical particles is investigated.\nThe particle interaction is modelled in a macroscopic way using the Hertzian\ncontact force with additional linear damping. The goal of the work is to\ndevelop an efficient approximate solution of sufficient accuracy for this\nproblem which can be used in soft-sphere collision models for Discrete Element\nMethods and for particle transport in viscous fluids. First, by the choice of\nappropriate units, the number of governing parameters of the collision process\nis reduced to one, which is a simple combination of known material parameters\nas well as initial conditions. It provides a dimensionless parameter that\ncharacterizes all such collisions up to dynamic similitude. Next, a rigorous\ncalculation of the collision time and restitution coefficient from the\ngoverning equations, in the form of a series expansion in this parameter is\nprovided. Such a calculation based on first principles is particularly\ninteresting from a theoretical perspective. Since the governing equations\npresent some technical difficulties, the methods employed are also of interest\nfrom the point of view of the analytical technique. Using further\napproximations, compact expressions for the restitution coefficient and the\ncollision time are then provided. These are used to implement an approximate\nalgebraic rule for computing the desired stiffness and damping in the framework\nof the adaptive collision model (Kempe & Fr\\\"{o}hlich, J. Fluid Mech., 709:\n445-489, 2012). Numerical tests with binary as well as multiple particle\ncollisions are reported to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed method and\nits superiority in terms of numerical efficiency.\n", "  We consider the problem of implementing mutually unbiased bases (MUB) for a\npolarization qubit with only one wave plate, the minimum number of wave plates.\nWe show that one wave plate is sufficient to realize two MUB as long as its\nphase shift (modulo $360^\\circ$) ranges between $45^\\circ$ and $315^\\circ$. {It\ncan realize} three MUB (a complete set of MUB for a qubit) if the phase shift\nof the wave plate is within $[111.5^\\circ, 141.7^\\circ]$ or its symmetric range\nwith respect to 180$^\\circ$. The systematic error of the realized MUB using a\nthird-wave plate (TWP) with $120^\\circ$ phase is calculated to be a half of\nthat using the combination of a quarter-wave plate (QWP) and a half-wave plate\n(HWP). As experimental applications, TWPs are used in single-qubit and\ntwo-qubit quantum state tomography experiments and the results show a\nsystematic error reduction by $50\\%$. This technique not only saves one wave\nplate but also reduces the systematic error, which can be applied to quantum\nstate tomography and other applications involving MUB. The proposed TWP may\nbecome a useful instrument in optical experiments, replacing multiple elements\nlike QWP and HWP.\n", "  The precision limit in quantum state tomography is of great interest not only\nto practical applications but also to foundational studies. However, little is\nknown about this subject in the multiparameter setting even theoretically due\nto the subtle information tradeoff among incompatible observables. In the case\nof a qubit, the theoretic precision limit was determined by Hayashi as well as\nGill and Massar, but attaining the precision limit in experiments has remained\na challenging task. Here we report the first experiment which achieves this\nprecision limit in adaptive quantum state tomography on optical polarization\nqubits. The two-step adaptive strategy employed in our experiment is very easy\nto implement in practice. Yet it is surprisingly powerful in optimizing most\nfigures of merit of practical interest. Our study may have significant\nimplications for multiparameter quantum estimation problems, such as quantum\nmetrology. Meanwhile, it may promote our understanding about the\ncomplementarity principle and uncertainty relations from the information\ntheoretic perspective.\n", "  Prediction models that capture and use the structure of state-space dynamics\ncan be very effective. In practice, however, one rarely has access to full\ninformation about that structure, and accurate reconstruction of the dynamics\nfrom scalar time-series data---e.g., via delay-coordinate embedding---can be a\nreal challenge. In this paper, we show that forecast models that employ\nincomplete embeddings of the dynamics can produce surprisingly accurate\npredictions of the state of a dynamical system. In particular, we demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of a simple near-neighbor forecast technique that works with\na two-dimensional embedding. Even though correctness of the topology is not\nguaranteed for incomplete reconstructions like this, the dynamical structure\nthat they capture allows for accurate predictions---in many cases, even more\naccurate than predictions generated using a full embedding. This could be very\nuseful in the context of real-time forecasting, where the human effort required\nto produce a correct delay-coordinate embedding is prohibitive.\n", "  Exact and rigorous solutions of the ground-state problem for the classical\nHeisenberg model with nearest-neighbor interactions on two- and\nthree-dimensional lattices composed of zigzag (triangular) ladders are obtained\nin a very simple way, with the use of a cluster method. It is shown how the\ngeometrical frustration due to the presence of triangles as structural units\nleads to the emergence of incommensurate spiral orderings and their collinear\nlimits. Interestingly, these orderings are determined by a single angle (along\nwith the signs of the interactions between neighboring spins); therefore, the\nterm \"single-angle spiral orderings\" is proposed.\n", "  We discuss how complex-oxide heterostructures that include high-Tc\nsuperconducting cuprates can be used to realize an array of sub-millimeter\ncavities that support Josephson plasmon polaritons. These cavities have several\nattractive features for new types of light matter interaction studies and we\nshow that they promote \"ultrastrong\" coupling between THz frequency radiation\nand Josephson plasmons. Cavity electrodynamics of Josephson plasmons allows to\nmanipulate the superconducting order-parameter phase coherence. As an example,\nwe discuss how it could be used to cool superconducting phase fluctuations with\nlight.\n", "  A hallmark feature of topological physics is the presence of one-way\npropagating chiral modes at the system boundary. The chirality of edge modes is\na consequence of the topological character of the bulk. For example, in a\nnon-interacting quantum Hall model, edge modes manifest as mid-gap states\nbetween two topologically distinct bulk bands. The bulk-boundary correspondence\ndictates that the number of chiral edge modes, a topological invariant called\nthe winding number, is completely determined by the bulk topological invariant,\nthe Chern number. Here, for the first time, we measure the winding number in a\n2D photonic system. By inserting a unit flux quantum at the edge, we show that\nthe edge spectrum resonances shift by the winding number. This experiment\nprovides a new approach for unambiguous measurement of topological invariants,\nindependent of the microscopic details, and could possibly be extended to probe\nstrongly correlated topological orders.\n", "  In this work we consider a DBI Galileon (DBIG) inflationary model and\nconstrain its parameter space with the Planck 2015 and BICEP2/Keck array and\nPlanck (BKP) joint analysis data by means of a potential independent analysis.\nWe focus our attention on inflationary solutions characterized by a constant or\nvarying sound speed as well as warp factor. We impose bounds on stringy aspects\nof the model, such as the warp factor $\\left(f\\right)$ and the induced gravity\nparameter $\\left(\\tilde{m}\\right)$. We study the parameter space of the model\nand find that the tensor-to-scalar ratio can be as low as\n$r\\simeq6\\times10^{-4}$ and inflation happens to be at GUT scale. In addition,\nwe obtain the tilt of the tensor power spectrum and test the standard\ninflationary consistency relation $\\left(r=-8n_{t}\\right)$ against the latest\nbounds from the combined results of BKP+Laser Interferometer\nGravitational-Waves Observatory (LIGO), and find that DBIG inflation predicts a\nred spectral index for the tensor power spectrum.\n", "  The low-energy limit of the massless two-loop five-point amplitudes for both\ntype IIA and type IIB superstrings is computed with the pure spinor formalism\nand its overall coefficient determined from first principles. For the type IIB\ntheory, the five-graviton amplitude is found to be proportional to its\ntree-level counterpart at the corresponding order in $\\alpha'$. Their ratio\nties in with expectations based on S-duality since it matches the same modular\nfunction $E_{5/2}$ which relates the two-loop and tree-level four-graviton\namplitudes. For R-symmetry violating states, the ratio between tree-level and\ntwo-loop amplitudes at the same $\\alpha'$-order carries an additional factor of\n$-3/5$. Its S-duality origin can be traced back to a modular form derived from\n$E_{5/2}$.\n", "  We apply two methods, namely the Gaussian processes and the non-parametric\nsmoothing procedure, to reconstruct the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ as a function\nof redshift from 15 measurements of the expansion rate obtained from age\nestimates of passively evolving galaxies. These reconstructions enable us to\nderive the luminosity distance to a certain redshift $z$, calibrate the\nlight-curve fitting parameters accounting for the (unknown) intrinsic magnitude\nof type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) and construct cosmological model-independent\nHubble diagrams of SNe Ia. In order to test the compatibility between the\nreconstructed functions of $H(z)$, we perform a statistical analysis\nconsidering the latest SNe Ia sample, the so-called JLA compilation. We find\nthat, for the Gaussian processes, the reconstructed functions of Hubble\nparameter versus redshift, and thus the following analysis on SNe Ia\ncalibrations and cosmological implications, are sensitive to prior mean\nfunctions. However, for the non-parametric smoothing method, the reconstructed\nfunctions are not dependent on initial guess models, and consistently require\nhigh values of $H_0$, which are in excellent agreement with recent measurements\nof this quantity from Cepheids and other local distance indicators.\n", "  We propose that the observed spin-relaxation in bilayer graphene is due to\nresonant scattering by magnetic impurities. We analyze a resonant scattering\nmodel due to adatoms on both dimer and non-dimer sites, finding that only the\nformer give narrow resonances at the charge neutrality point. Opposite to\nsingle-layer graphene, the measured spin-relaxation rate in graphene bilayer\nincreases with carrier density. Although it has been commonly argued that a\ndifferent mechanism must be at play for the two structures, our model explains\nthis behavior rather naturally in terms of different broadening scales for the\nsame underlying resonant processes. Not only our results---using robust and\nfirst-principles inspired parameters---agree with experiment, they also predict\nan experimentally testable sharp decrease of the spin-relaxation rate at high\ncarrier densities.\n", "  We describe a \"spatio-spectral\" deconvolution algorithm for wide-band imaging\nin radio interferometry. In contrast with the existing multi-frequency\nreconstruction algorithms, the proposed method does not rely on a model of the\nsky-brightness spectral distribution. This non-parametric approach can be of\nparticular interest for the new generation of low frequency radiotelescopes.\nThe proposed solution formalizes the reconstruction problem as a convex\noptimization problem with spatial and spectral regularizations. The efficiency\nof this approach has been already proven for narrow-band image reconstruction\nand the present contribution can be considered as its extension to the\nmulti-frequency case. Because the number of frequency bands multiplies the size\nof the inverse problem, particular attention is devoted to the derivation of an\niterative large scale optimization algorithm. It is shown that the main\ncomputational bottleneck of the approach, which lies in the resolution of a\nlinear system, can be efficiently overcome by a fully parallel implementation\nw.r.t. the frequencies, where each processor reconstructs a narrow-band image.\nAll the other optimization steps are extremely fast. A parallel implementation\nof the algorithm in Julia is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/andferrari. Preliminary simulations illustrate the\nperformances of the method and its ability to reconstruct complex\nspatio-spectral structures.\n", "  We propose and analyze an optically loaded quantum memory exploiting\ncapacitive coupling between self-assembled quantum dot molecules and\nelectrically gated quantum dot molecules. The self-assembled dots are used for\nspin-photon entanglement, which is transferred to the gated dots for long-term\nstorage or processing via a teleportation process heralded by single-photon\ndetection. We illustrate a device architecture enabling this interaction and we\noutline its operation and fabrication. We provide self-consistent\nPoisson-Schroedinger simulations to establish the design viability and refine\nthe design, and to estimate the physical coupling parameters and their\nsensitivities to dot placement. The device we propose generates heralded copies\nof an entangled state between a photonic qubit and a solid-state qubit with a\nrapid reset time upon failure. The resulting fast rate of entanglement\ngeneration is of high utility for heralded quantum networking scenarios\ninvolving lossy optical channels.\n", "  It is well known that in quantum spin liquids and other magnetically\ndisordered systems, the tunneling amplitudes between different nearest-neighbor\nvalence bond (NNVB) configurations drop exponentially in the length L of the\ntunneling loops. Here we show that virtual excursions outside the NNVB basis\ncan alter completely this fundamental quantum-mechanical notion even in extreme\ncases where the minimal NNVB truncation appears very robust. This paradigm\nshift is demonstrated for the quantum spin-1/2 square-kagome, where strong\ngeometric frustration, similar to the two-dimensional kagome, prevents magnetic\nordering down to zero temperature. The shortest tunneling events suffer from\nthe strongest fluctuations, leading to amplitudes that do not drop\nexponentially with L, and to an unexpected loop-six valence bond crystal phase,\nwhich would otherwise be very far in the parameter space in the absence of\nvirtual singlets. The low-energy effective description gives in addition a\nclear example of correlated loop processes that depend not only on the type of\nthe loop but also on its lattice embedding, a direct manifestation of the\nlong-range nature of the virtual singlets.\n", "  We study a universal structure of two and three dimensional self-gravitating\nsystems in the quasi-equilibrium state. It is shown numerically that the two\ndimensional self-gravitating system in the quasi-equilibrium state has the same\nkind of density profile as the three dimensional one. We develop a\nphenomenological model to describe this universal structure by using a special\nLangevin equation with a distinctive random noise to self-gravitating systems.\nWe find that the density profile derived theoretically is consistent well with\nresults of observations and simulations.\n", "  ALMA Cycle 2 observations of the long wavelength dust emission in 180\nstar-forming (SF) galaxies are used to investigate the evolution of ISM masses\nat z = 1 to 6.4. The ISM masses exhibit strong increases from z = 0 to $\\rm\n<z>$ = 1.15 and further to $\\rm <z>$ = 2.2 and 4.8, particularly amongst\ngalaxies above the SF galaxy main sequence (MS). The galaxies with highest SFRs\nat $\\rm <z>$ = 2.2 and 4.8 have gas masses 100 times that of the Milky Way and\ngas mass fractions reaching 50 to 80\\%, i.e. gas masses 1 - 4$\\times$ their\nstellar masses. For the full sample of galaxies, we find a single, very simple\nSF law: $\\rm SFR \\propto M_{\\rm ISM}^{0.9}$, i.e. a `linear' dependence on the\nISM mass -- on and above the MS. Thus, the galaxies above the MS are converting\ntheir larger ISM masses into stars on a timescale similar to those on the MS.\nAt z $> 1$, the entire population of star-forming galaxies has $\\sim$5 -\n10$\\times$ shorter gas depletion times ($\\sim0.2$ Gyr) than galaxies at low\nredshift. These {\\bf shorter depletion times are due to a different, dominant\nmode of SF in the early universe} -- dynamically driven by compressive, high\ndispersion gas motions and/or galaxy interactions. The dispersive gas motions\nare a natural consequence of the extraordinarily high gas accretion rates which\nmust occur to maintain the prodigious SF.\n", "  A new finite volume (FV) discretisation method for the Lattice Boltzmann (LB)\nequation which combines high accuracy with limited computational cost is\npresented. In order to assess the performance of the FV method we carry out a\nsystematic comparison, focused on accuracy and computational performances, with\nthe standard $streaming$ (ST) Lattice Boltzmann equation algorithm. To our\nknowledge such a systematic comparison has never been previously reported. In\nparticular we aim at clarifying whether and in which conditions the proposed\nalgorithm, and more generally any FV algorithm, can be taken as the method of\nchoice in fluid-dynamics LB simulations. For this reason the comparative\nanalysis is further extended to the case of realistic flows, in particular\nthermally driven flows in turbulent conditions. We report the first successful\nsimulation of high-Rayleigh number convective flow performed by a Lattice\nBoltzmann FV based algorithm with wall grid refinement.\n", "  We construct measures for the non-Markovianity of quantum evolution with a\nphysically meaningful interpretation. We first provide a general setting in the\nframework of channel capacities and propose two families of meaningful\nquantitative measures, based on the largest revival of a channel capacity,\navoiding some drawbacks of other non-Markovianity measures. We relate the\nproposed measures to the task of information screening. This shows that the\nnon-Markovianity of a quantum process may be used as a resource. Under these\nconsiderations, we analyze two paradigmatic examples, a qubit in a quantum\nenvironment with classically mixed dynamics and the Jaynes-Cummings model.\n", "  We propose a universal language to assess macroscopic quantumness in terms of\ncoherence, with a set of conditions that should be satisfied by any measure of\nmacroscopic coherence. We link the framework to the resource theory of\nasymmetry. We show that the quantum Fisher information gives a good measure of\nmacroscopic coherence, enabling a rigorous justification of a previously\nproposed measure of macroscopicity. This picture lets us draw connections\nbetween different measures of macroscopicity and evaluate them; we show that\nanother widely studied measure fails one of our criteria.\n", "  We revisit the kink-like parametrization of the deceleration parameter q(z),\nwhich considers a transition, at $z_t$, from cosmic deceleration to\nacceleration. In this parametrization the initial, at $z \\gg z_t$, value of the\nq-parameter is $q_i$, its final, z=-1, value is $q_f$ and the duration of the\ntransition is parametrized by $\\tau$. By assuming a flat space geometry we\nobtain constraints on the free parameters of the model using recent data from\ntype Ia supernovae, BAO, CMB and the Hubble parameter H(z). The use of H(z)\ndata introduces an explicit dependence of the combined likelihood on the\npresent value of the Hubble parameter $H_0$, allowing us to explore the\ninfluence of different priors when marginalizing over this parameter. We also\nstudy the importance of the CMB information in the results by considering data\nfrom WMAP7, WMAP9 and Planck. We show that the contours and best fit do not\ndepend much on the different CMB data used and that the considered new BAO data\nis responsible for most of the improvement in the results. Assuming a flat\nspace geometry, $q_i=1/2$ and expressing the present value of the deceleration\nparameter $q_0$ as a function of the other three free parameters, we obtain\n$z_t=0.67^{+0.10}_{-0.08}$, $\\tau=0.26^{+0.14}_{-0.10}$ and\n$q_0=-0.48^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$, at 68\\% of confidence level, with an uniform prior\nover $H_0$. If in addition we fix $q_f=-1$, as in flat $\\Lambda$CDM, DGP and\nChaplygin quartessence that are special models described by our\nparametrization, we get $z_t=0.66^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$, $\\tau=0.33^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$\nand $q_0=-0.54^{+0.05}_{-0.07}$, in excellent agreement with flat $\\Lambda$CDM\nfor which $\\tau=1/3$. We also obtain for flat wCDM, another dark energy model\ndescribed by our parametrization, the constraint on the equation of state\nparameter -1.22 < w < -0.78 at more than 99% confidence level.\n", "  4U 1630-472 is a recurrent X-ray transient classified as a black-hole\ncandidate from its spectral and timing properties. One of the peculiarities of\nthis source is the presence of regular outbursts with a recurrence period\nbetween 600 and 730 d that has been observed since the discovery of the source\nin 1969. We report on a comparative study on the spectral and timing behaviour\nof three consecutive outbursts occurred in 2006, 2008 and 2010. We analysed all\nthe data collected by the INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory\n(INTEGRAL) and the Rossi X-ray timing Explorer (RXTE) during these three years\nof activity. We show that, in spite of having a similar spectral and timing\nbehaviour in the energy range between 3 and 30 keV, these three outbursts show\npronounced differences above 30 keV. In fact, the 2010 outburst extends at high\nenergies without any detectable cut-off until 150-200 keV, while the two\nprevious outbursts that occurred in 2006 and 2008 are not detected at all above\n30 keV. Thus, in spite of a very similar accretion disk evolution, these three\noutbursts exhibit totally different characteristics of the Compton electron\ncorona, showing a softening in their evolution rarely observed before in a low\nmass X-ray binary hosting a black hole. We argue the possibility that the\nunknown perturbation that causes the outbursts to be equally spaced in time\ncould be at the origin of this particular behaviour. Finally we describe\nseveral possible scenarios that could explain the regularity of the outbursts,\nidentifying the most plausible, such as a third body orbiting around the binary\nsystem.\n", "  Analyzing the noise in the momentum profiles of single realizations of\none-dimensional Bose gases, we present the experimental measurement of the full\nmomentum-space density correlations $\\langle \\delta n_p \\delta n_{p'}\\rangle$,\nwhich are related to the two-body momentum correlation function. Our data span\nthe weakly interacting region of the phase diagram, going from the the ideal\nBose gas regime to the quasicondensate regime. We show experimentally that the\nbunching phenomenon, which manifests itself as super-Poissonian local\nfluctuations in momentum space, is present in all regimes. The quasicondensate\nregime is however characterized by the presence of negative correlations\nbetween different momenta, in contrast to Bogolyubov theory for Bose\ncondensates, predicting positive correlations between opposite momenta. Our\ndata are in good agreement with {\\it ab-initio} calculations.\n", "  We introduce a dust model for cosmological simulations implemented in the\nmoving-mesh code AREPO and present a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical\nzoom-in simulations to study dust formation within galactic haloes. Our model\naccounts for the stellar production of dust, accretion of gas-phase metals onto\nexisting grains, destruction of dust through local supernova activity, and dust\ndriven by winds from star-forming regions. We find that accurate stellar and\nactive galactic nuclei feedback is needed to reproduce the observed\ndust-metallicity relation and that dust growth largely dominates dust\ndestruction. Our simulations predict a dust content of the interstellar medium\nwhich is consistent with observed scaling relations at $z = 0$, including\nscalings between dust-to-gas ratio and metallicity, dust mass and gas mass,\ndust-to-gas ratio and stellar mass, and dust-to-stellar mass ratio and gas\nfraction. We find that roughly two-thirds of dust at $z = 0$ originated from\nType II supernovae, with the contribution from asymptotic giant branch stars\nbelow 20 per cent for $z \\gtrsim 5$. While our suite of Milky Way-sized\ngalaxies forms dust in good agreement with a number of key observables, it\npredicts a high dust-to-metal ratio in the circumgalactic medium, which\nmotivates a more realistic treatment of thermal sputtering of grains and dust\ncooling channels.\n", "  An algorithm is described for evolving the phase-space density of stars or\ncompact objects around a massive black hole at the center of a galaxy. The\ntechnique is based on numerical integration of the Fokker-Planck equation in\nenergy-angular momentum space, f(E,L,t), and includes, for the first time,\ndiffusion coefficients that describe the effects of both random and correlated\nencounters (resonant relaxation), as well as energy loss due to emission of\ngravitational waves. Destruction or loss of stars into the black hole are\ntreated by means of a detailed boundary-layer analysis. Performance of the\nalgorithm is illustrated by calculating two-dimensional, time-dependent and\nsteady-state distribution functions and their corresponding loss rates.\n", "  Quantum theory is known to be nonlocal in the sense that separated parties\ncan perform measurements on a shared quantum state to obtain correlated\nprobability distributions, which cannot be achieved if the parties share only\nclassical randomness. Here we find that the set of distributions compatible\nwith sharing quantum states subject to some sufficiently restricted dimension\nis neither convex nor a superset of the classical distributions. We examine the\nrelationship between quantum distributions associated with a dimensional\nconstraint and classical distributions associated with limited shared\nrandomness. We prove that quantum correlations are convex for certain finite\ndimension in certain Bell scenarios and that they sometimes offer a dimensional\nadvantage in realizing local distributions. We also consider if there exist\nBell scenarios where the set of quantum correlations is never convex with\nfinite dimensionality.\n", "  There is much evidence that planet formation is occurring in the disk around\nthe Herbig Be star HD100546. To learn more about the processes occurring in\nthis disk we conducted high resolution imaging at 43/45 GHz with the Australia\nTelescope Compact Array (ATCA). Multiple array configurations were used,\nproviding a best spatial resolution of $\\sim$ 0.15 arcsec, or 15 AU at\nHD100546's distance of $\\sim$ 100 pc. Significant structure is revealed, but\nits precise form is dependent on the $u-v$ plane sampling used for the image\nreconstruction. At a resolution of $\\leq$ 30 AU we detected an inner gap in the\ndisk with a radius of $\\sim$ 25 AU and a position angle approximately along the\nknown disk major axis. With different weighting, and an achieved resolution of\n$\\sim$ 15 AU, emission appears at the centre and the disk takes on the shape of\nan incomplete ring, much like a horseshoe, again with a gap radius of $\\sim$ 25\nAU. The position angle of the disk major axis and its inclination from face-on\nare determined to be $140^{\\circ}\\pm5^{\\circ}$ and $40^{\\circ}\\pm5^{\\circ}$\nrespectively. The $\\sim$ 25 AU gap radius is confirmed by a null in the real\npart of the binned visibilities at 320$\\pm$10 k$\\lambda$, whilst the\nnon-axisymmetric nature is also confirmed through significant structure in the\nimaginary component. The emission mechanism at the central peak is most likely\nto be free-free emission from a stellar or disk wind. Overall our data support\nthe picture of at least one, but probably several, giant planets orbiting\nHD100546 within 25 AU.\n", "  QFT approaches elaborated for treating quantum effects in time-dependent\nexternal electric fields are not directly applicable to time-independent\nnonuniform electric fields that are given by a step potential and their\ngeneralization for the such potentials was not sufficiently developed. Such\nfields can also create particles from the vacuum, the Klein paradox being\nclosely related to this process. We believe that the present work presents a\nconsistent solution of the latter problem. Quantizing the Dirac and scalar\nfields with time independent backgrounds, we have found in- and out-creation\nand annihilation operators that allow one to have particle interpretation of\nthe physical system under consideration. To justify the proposed\nidentification, we have performed a detailed mathematical and physical analysis\nof solutions of the corresponding relativistic wave equations with a subsequent\nQFT analysis. We elaborated a nonperturbative technique that allows one to\ncalculate all characteristics of zero-order processes such scattering,\nreflection, and electron-positron pair creation, and to calculate Feynman\ndiagrams that describe all characteristics of processes with interaction\nbetween the in-, out-particles and photons. These diagrams have formally the\nusual form, but contain special propagators. Expressions for these propagators\nin terms of in- and out-solutions are presented. We apply the elaborated\napproach to two popular exactly solvable cases: to the Sauter potential and to\nthe Klein step.\n", "  In order to model the thermal structure of polythermal ice sheets accurately,\nenergy-conserving schemes and correct tracking of the cold-temperate transition\nsurface (CTS) are necessary. We compare four different thermodynamics solvers\nin the ice sheet model SICOPOLIS. Two exist already, namely a two-layer\npolythermal scheme (POLY) and a single-phase cold-ice scheme (COLD), while the\nother two are newly-implemented, one-layer enthalpy schemes, namely a\nconventional scheme (ENTC) and a melting-CTS scheme (ENTM). The comparison uses\nscenarios of the EISMINT Phase 2 Simplified Geometry Experiments (Payne and\nothers, 2000, J. Glaciol. 46, 227-238). The POLY scheme is used as a reference\nagainst which the performance of the other schemes is tested. Both the COLD\nscheme and the ENTC scheme fail to produce a continuous temperature gradient\nacross the CTS, which is explicitly enforced by the ENTM scheme. ENTM is more\nprecise than ENTC for determining the position of the CTS, while the\nperformance of both schemes is good for the temperature/water-content profiles\nin the entire ice column. Therefore, the one-layer enthalpy schemes ENTC and\nENTM are viable, easier implementable alternatives to the POLY scheme with its\nneed to handle two different numerical domains for cold and temperate ice.\n", "  Despite being the most prominent emission line in the solar spectrum, there\nhas been a notable lack of studies devoted to variations in Ly$\\alpha$ emission\nduring solar flares in recent years. However, the few examples that do exist\nhave shown Ly$\\alpha$ emission to be a substantial radiator of the total energy\nbudget of solar flares (on the order of 10%). It is also a known driver of\nfluctuations in earth's ionosphere. The EUV Variability Experiment (EVE)\nonboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory now provides broadband, photometric\nLy$\\alpha$ data at 10 s cadence with its Multiple EUV Grating\nSpectrograph-Photometer (MEGS-P) component, and has observed scores of solar\nflares in the 5 years since it was launched. However, the MEGS-P time profiles\nappear to display a rise time of tens of minutes around the time of the flare\nonset. This is in stark contrast to the rapid, impulsive increase observed in\nother intrinsically chromospheric features (H$\\alpha$, Ly$\\beta$, LyC, C III,\netc.). Furthermore, the emission detected by MEGS-P peaks around the time of\nthe peak of thermal soft X-ray emission, rather than during the impulsive phase\nwhen energy deposition in the chromosphere - often assumed to be in the form of\nnonthermal electrons - is greatest. Given that spectrally-resolved Ly$\\alpha$\nobservations during flares from SORCE/SOLSTICE peak during the impulsive phase\nas expected, this suggests that the atypical behaviour of MEGS-P data is a\nmanifestation of the broadband nature of the observations. This could imply\nthat other lines and/or continuum emission that becomes enhanced during flares\ncould be contributing to the passband. Users are hereby urged to exercise\ncaution when interpreting broadband Ly$\\alpha$ observations of solar flares.\nComparisons have also been made with other broadband Ly$\\alpha$ photometers\nsuch as PROBA2/LYRA and GOES/EUVS-E.\n", "  Chiral effective field theory (chiEFT) provides a systematic approach to\ndescribe low-energy nuclear forces. Moreover, chiEFT is able to provide\nwell-founded estimates of statistical and systematic uncertainties -- although\nthis unique advantage has not yet been fully exploited. We fill this gap by\nperforming an optimization and statistical analysis of all the low-energy\nconstants (LECs) up to next-to-next-to-leading order. Our optimization protocol\ncorresponds to a simultaneous fit to scattering and bound-state observables in\nthe pion-nucleon, nucleon-nucleon, and few-nucleon sectors, thereby utilizing\nthe full model capabilities of chiEFT. We study the effect on other observables\nby demonstrating error-propagation methods that can easily be adopted by future\nworks. We employ mathematical optimization and implement automatic\ndifferentiation to attain efficient and machine-precise first- and second-order\nderivatives of the objective function with respect to the LECs. We use\npower-counting arguments to estimate the systematic uncertainty that is\ninherent to chiEFT and we construct chiral interactions at different orders\nwith quantified uncertainties. Statistical error propagation is compared with\nMonte Carlo sampling showing that statistical errors are in general small\ncompared to systematic ones. In conclusion, we find that a simultaneous fit to\ndifferent sets of data is critical to (i) identify the optimal set of LECs,\n(ii) capture all relevant correlations, (iii) reduce the statistical\nuncertainty, and (iv) attain order-by-order convergence in chiEFT. Furthermore,\ncertain systematic uncertainties in the few-nucleon sector are shown to get\nsubstantially magnified in the many-body sector; in particlar when varying the\ncutoff in the chiral potentials. The methodology and results presented in this\nPaper open a new frontier for uncertainty quantification in ab initio nuclear\ntheory.\n", "  We describe a method for initializing an ensemble of qubits in a pure ground\nstate by applying collective cavity cooling techniques in the presence of local\ndephasing noise on each qubit. To solve the dynamics of the ensemble system we\nintroduce a method for dissipative perturbation theory that applies average\nHamiltonian theory in an imaginary-time dissipative interaction frame to find\nan average effective dissipator for the system dynamics. We use SU(4) algebra\ngenerators to analytically solve the first order perturbation for an arbitrary\nnumber of qubits in the ensemble. We find that to first order the effective\ndissipator describes local $T_1$ thermal relaxation to the ground state of each\nqubit in the ensemble at a rate equal to the collective cavity cooling\ndissipation rate. The proposed technique should permit the parallel\ninitialization of high purity states in large ensemble quantum systems based on\nsolid-state spins.\n", "  Direct numerical integrations of the Fokker-Planck equation in energy-angular\nmomentum space are carried out for stars orbiting a supermassive black hole\n(SBH) at the center of a galaxy. The algorithm, which was described in detail\nin an earlier paper, includes diffusion coefficients that describe the effects\nof both random (\"classical\") and correlated (\"resonant\") encounters.\nSteady-state solutions are similar to the Bahcall-Wolf solution but are\nmodified at small radii due to the higher rate of diffusion in angular\nmomentum, which results in a low-density core. The core radius is a few percent\nof the influence radius of the SBH. The corresponding phase-space density\nf(E,L) drops nearly to zero at low energies, implying almost no stars on\ntightly-bound orbits about the SBH. Steady-state rates of stellar disruption\nare presented, and a simple analytic expression is found that reproduces the\nnumerical feeding rates with good accuracy. The distribution of periapsides of\ndisrupted stars is also computed. Time-dependent solutions are also computed,\nstarting from initial conditions similar to those produced by a binary SBH. In\nthese models, feeding rates evolve on two timescales: rapid evolution during\nwhich the region evacuated by the massive binary is refilled by\nangular-momentum diffusion; and slower evolution as diffusion in energy causes\nthe density profile at large radii to attain the Bahcall-Wolf form.\n", "  We present one-shot compression protocols that optimally encode ensembles of\n$N$ identically prepared mixed states into $O(\\log N)$ qubits. In contrast to\nthe case of pure-state ensembles, we find that the number of encoding qubits\ndrops down discontinuously as soon as a nonzero error is tolerated and the\nspectrum of the states is known with sufficient precision. For qubit ensembles,\nthis feature leads to a 25% saving of memory space. Our compression protocols\ncan be implemented efficiently on a quantum computer.\n", "  The quantum emulation of spin-momentum coupling (SMC), a crucial ingredient\nfor the emergence of topological phases, is currently drawing considerable\ninterest. In previous quantum gas experiments, typically two atomic hyperfine\nstates were chosen as pseudospins. Here, we report the observation of a new\nkind of SMC achieved by loading a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) into\nperiodically driven optical lattices. The s- and p-bands of a static lattice,\nwhich act as pseudospins, are coupled through an additional moving lattice\nwhich induces a momentum dependent coupling between the two pseudospins,\nresulting in s-p hybrid Floquet-Bloch bands. We investigate the band structures\nby measuring the quasimomentum of the BEC for different velocities and\nstrengths of the moving lattice and compare our measurements to theoretical\npredictions. The realization of SMC with lattice bands as pseudospins paves the\nway for engineering novel quantum matter using hybrid orbital bands.\n", "  The discrepancy between maximally entangled states and maximally\nnon-classical quantum correlations is well-known but still not well understood.\nWe aim to investigate the relation between quantum correlations and\nentanglement in a family Bell inequalities with $N$-settings and $d$ outcomes.\nUsing analytical as well as numerical techniques, we derive both maximal\nquantum violations and violations obtained from maximally entangled states.\nFurthermore, we study the most non-classical quantum states in terms of their\nentanglement entropy for large values of $d$ and many measurement settings.\nInterestingly, we find that the entanglement entropy behaves very differently\ndepending on whether $N=2$ or $N> 2$: when $N=2$ the entanglement entropy is a\nmonotone function of $d$ and the most non-classical state is far from maximally\nentangled, whereas when $N> 2$ the entanglement entropy is a non-monotone\nfunction of $d$ and converges to that of the maximally entangled state in the\nlimit of large $d$.\n", "  Detecting communities in a network, based only on the adjacency matrix, is a\nproblem of interest to several scientific disciplines. Recently, Zhang and\nMoore have introduced an algorithm in [P. Zhang and C. Moore, Proceedings of\nthe National Academy of Sciences 111, 18144 (2014)], called mod-bp, that avoids\noverfitting the data by optimizing a weighted average of modularity (a popular\ngoodness-of-fit measure in community detection) and entropy (i.e. number of\nconfigurations with a given modularity). The adjustment of the relative weight,\nthe \"temperature\" of the model, is crucial for getting a correct result from\nmod-bp. In this work we study the many phase transitions that mod-bp may\nundergo by changing the two parameters of the algorithm: the temperature $T$\nand the maximum number of groups $q$. We introduce a new set of order\nparameters that allow to determine the actual number of groups $\\hat{q}$, and\nwe observe on both synthetic and real networks the existence of phases with any\n$\\hat{q} \\in \\{1,q\\}$, which were unknown before. We discuss how to interpret\nthe results of mod-bp and how to make the optimal choice for the problem of\ndetecting significant communities.\n", "  Measuring entanglement is a demanding task that usually requires full\ntomography of a quantum system, involving a number of observables that grows\nexponentially with the number of parties. Recently, it was suggested that\nadding a single ancillary qubit would allow for the efficient measurement of\nconcurrence, and indeed any entanglement monotone associated to antilinear\noperations. Here, we report on the experimental implementation of such a\ndevice---an embedding quantum simulator---in photonics, encoding the entangling\ndynamics of a bipartite system into a tripartite one. We show that bipartite\nconcurrence can be efficiently extracted from the measurement of merely two\nobservables, instead of fifteen, without full tomographic information.\n", "  Signatures of the processes in the early Universe are imprinted in the cosmic\nweb. Some of them may define shell-like structures characterised by typical\nscales. We search for shell-like structures in the distribution of nearby rich\nclusters of galaxies drawn from the SDSS DR8. We calculate the distance\ndistributions between rich clusters of galaxies, and groups and clusters of\nvarious richness, look for the maxima in the distance distributions, and select\ncandidates of shell-like structures. We analyse the space distribution of\ngroups and clusters forming shell walls. We find six possible candidates of\nshell-like structures, in which galaxy clusters have maxima in the distance\ndistribution to other galaxy groups and clusters at the distance of about 120\nMpc/h. The rich galaxy cluster A1795, the central cluster of the Bootes\nsupercluster, has the highest maximum in the distance distribution of other\ngroups and clusters around them at the distance of about 120 Mpc/h among our\nrich cluster sample, and another maximum at the distance of about 240 Mpc/h.\nThe structures of galaxy systems causing the maxima at 120 Mpc/h form an almost\ncomplete shell of galaxy groups, clusters and superclusters. The richest\nsystems in the nearby universe, the Sloan Great Wall, the Corona Borealis\nsupercluster and the Ursa Major supercluster are among them. The probability\nthat we obtain maxima like this from random distributions is lower than 0.001.\nOur results confirm that shell-like structures can be found in the distribution\nof nearby galaxies and their systems. The radii of the possible shells are\nlarger than expected for a BAO shell (approximately 109 Mpc/h versus\napproximately 120 Mpc/h), and they are determined by very rich galaxy clusters\nand superclusters with high density contrast while BAO shells are barely seen\nin the galaxy distribution. We discuss possible consequences of these\ndifferences.\n", "  The question whether global entanglement of a multiparticle quantum system\ncan be inferred from local properties is of great relevance for the theory of\nquantum correlations as well as for experimental implementations. We present a\nmethod to systematically find quantum states, for which the two- or three-body\nmarginals do not contain any entanglement, nevertheless, the knowledge of these\nreduced states is sufficient to prove genuine multiparticle entanglement of the\nglobal state. With this, we show that the emergence of global entanglement from\nseparable local quantum states occurs frequently and for an arbitrary number of\nparticles. We discuss various extensions of the phenomenon and present examples\nwhere global entanglement can be proven from marginals, even if entanglement\ncannot be localized in the marginals with measurements on the other parties.\n", "  Experimental studies of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) focus on two, in\npractice distinct, regimes: one in which the baryonic chemical potential\n$\\mu_B$ is essentially zero, the other in which it is of the same order of\nmagnitude as the temperature. The cosmic QGP which dominates the early Universe\nafter reheating is normally assumed to be of the first kind, but recently it\nhas been suggested that it might well be of the second: this is the case in the\ntheory of \"Little Inflation\". If that is so, then it becomes a pressing issue\nto fix the trajectory of the Universe, as it cools, through the quark matter\nphase diagram: in particular, one wishes to know where in that diagram the\nplasma epoch ends, so that the initial conditions of the hadronic epoch can be\ndetermined. Here we combine various tools from strongly coupled QGP theory (the\nlatest lattice results, together with gauge-gravity duality) in order to\nconstrain that trajectory, assuming that Little Inflation did occur.\n", "  We consider several spin-unrestricted random-phase approximation (RPA)\nvariants for calculating correlation energies, with and without range\nseparation, and test them on datasets of atomization energies and reaction\nbarrier heights. We show that range separation greatly improves the accuracy of\nall RPA variants for these properties. Moreover, we show that a RPA variant\nwith exchange, hereafter referred to as RPAx-SO2, first proposed by Sz-abo and\nOstlund [A. Szabo and N. S. Ostlund, J. Chem. Phys. 67, 4351 (1977)] in a\nspin-restricted closed-shell formalism, and extended here to a\nspin-unrestricted formalism , provides on average the most accurate\nrange-separated RPA variant for atomization energies and reaction barrier\nheights. Since this range-separated RPAx-SO2 method had already been shown to\nbe among the most accurate range-separated RPA variants for weak intermolecular\ninteractions [J. Toulouse, W. Zhu, A. Savin, G. Jansen, and J. G.\n{\\'A}ngy{\\'a}n, J. Chem. Phys. 135, 084119 (2011)], this works confirms\nrange-separated RPAx-SO2 as a promising method for general chemical\napplications.\n", "  Experimentally observed ultrafast all-optical magnetization reversal in\nferrimagnetic metals and heterostructures based on antiferromagnetically\ncoupled ferromagnetic $d-$ and $f-$metallic layers relies on intricate energy\nand angular momentum flow between electrons, phonons and spins. Here we treat\nthe problem of angular momentum transfer in the course of ultrafast\nlaser-induced dynamics in a ferrimagnetic metallic system using microscopical\napproach based on the system of rate equations. We show that the magnetization\nreversal is supported by a coupling of $d-$ and $f-$ subsystems to delocalized\n$s-$ or $p-$ electrons. The latter can transfer spin between the two subsystems\nin an incoherent way owing to the $(s;p)-(d;f)$ exchange scattering. Since the\neffect of the external excitation in this process is reduced to the transient\nheating of the mobile electron subsystem, we also discuss possibility to\ntrigger the magnetization reversal by applying a voltage bias pulse to\nantiferromagnetically coupled metallic ferromagnetic layers embedded in point\ncontact or tunneling structures. We argue that such devices allow controlling\nreversal with high accuracy. We also suggest to use the anomalous Hall effect\nto register the reversal, thus playing a role of reading probes.\n", "  We demonstrate that magnetic $3d$ impurities with $S=3/2$ spins and no\norbital degree of freedom induce changes of spin-orbital order in a $4d^4$ Mott\ninsulator with $S=1$ spins. Impurities act either as spin defects which\ndecouple from the surrounding ions, or trigger orbital polarons along $3d$-$4d$\nbonds. The $4d$-$4d$ superexchange in the host $J_{\\rm host}$ competes with\n$3d$-$4d$ superexchange $J_{\\rm imp}$ --- it depends on which orbital is doubly\noccupied. The spin-orbital order within the host is totally modified at doping\n$x=1/4$. Our findings provide new perspective for future theoretical and\nexperimental studies of doped transition-metal oxides.\n", "  We present measurements of $\\Omega$ and $\\phi$ production at mid-rapidity\nfrom Au+Au collisions at nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energies\n$\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7, 11.5, 19.6, 27 and 39 GeV by the STAR experiment at the\nRelativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Motivated by the coalescence formation\nmechanism for these strange hadrons, we study the ratios of\n$N(\\Omega^{-}+\\Omega^{+})/(2N(\\phi))$. These ratios as a function of transverse\nmomentum ($p_T$) fall on a consistent trend at high collision energies, but\nstart to show deviations in peripheral collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 19.6, 27\nand 39 GeV, and in central collisions at 11.5 GeV in the intermediate $p_T$\nregion of 2.4-3.6 GeV/c. We further evaluate empirically the strange quark\n$p_T$ distributions at hadronization by studying the $\\Omega/\\phi$ ratios\nscaled by the number of constituent quarks. The NCQ-scaled $\\Omega/\\phi$ ratios\nshow a suppression of strange quark production in central collisions at 11.5\nGeV compared to $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} >= 19.6$ GeV. The shapes of the presumably\nthermal strange quark distributions in 0-60% most central collisions at 7.7 GeV\nshow significant deviations from those in 0-10% most central collisions at\nhigher energies. These features suggest that there is likely a change of the\nunderlying strange quark dynamics in the transition from quark-matter to\nhadronic matter at collision energies below 19.6 GeV.\n", "  Kirchhoff's kinetic analogy relates the deformation of an incompressible\nelastic rod to the classical dynamics of rigid body rotation. We extend the\nanalogy to compressible filaments and find that the extension is similar to the\nintroduction of relativistic effects into the dynamical system. The extended\nanalogy reveals a surprising symmetry in the deformations of compressible\nelastica. In addition, we use known results for the buckling of compressible\nelastica to derive the explicit solution for the motion of a relativistic\nnonlinear pendulum. We discuss cases where the extended Kirchhoff analogy may\nbe useful for the study of other soft matter systems.\n", "  In this article, the tensor-vector-pseudoscalar type of vertex is analyzed\nwith the QCD sum rules and the local-QCD sum rules. Correspondingly, the\nhadronic coupling constants of D2*(2460), Ds2*(2573), B2*(5747) and Bs2*(5840),\nand their decay widths are calculated. The results indicate that the QCD sum\nrules and the local-QCD sum rules give the consistent descriptions. Finally,\nthe full widths of these 4 tensor mesons are discussed in detail.\n", "  Surface plasmon spectrum of a metallic hyperbola can be found analytically\nwith the separation of variables in elliptic coordinates. The spectrum consists\nof two branches: symmetric, low-frequency branch, $\\omega <\\omega_0/\\sqrt{2}$,\nand antisymmetric high-frequency branch, $\\omega >\\omega_0/\\sqrt{2}$, where\n$\\omega_0$ is the bulk plasmon frequency. The frequency width of the plasmon\nband increases with decreasing the angle between the asymptotes of the\nhyperbola. For the simplest multi-connected geometry of two hyperbolas\nseparated by an air spacer the plasmon spectrum contains two low-frequency\nbranches and two high-frequency branches. Most remarkably, the lower of two\nlow-frequency branches exists at $\\omega \\rightarrow 0$, i.e., unlike a single\nhyperbola, it is \"thresholdless.\" We study how the complex structure of the\nplasmon spectrum affects the energy transfer between two emitters located on\nthe surface of the same hyperbola and on the surfaces of different hyperbolas.\n", "  Temporal relaxation of density fluctuations in supercooled liquids near the\nglass transition occurs in multiple steps. The short-time $\\beta$-relaxation is\ngenerally attributed to spatially local processes involving the rattling motion\nof a particle in the transient cage formed by its neighbors. Using molecular\ndynamics simulations for three model glass-forming liquids, we show that the\n$\\beta$-relaxation is actually cooperative in nature. Using finite-size scaling\nanalysis, we extract a growing length-scale associated with $\\beta$-relaxation\nfrom the observed dependence of the $\\beta$-relaxation time on the system size.\nRemarkably, the temperature dependence of this length scale is found to be the\nsame as that of the length scale that describes the spatial heterogeneity of\nlocal dynamics in the long-time $\\alpha$-relaxation regime. These results show\nthat the conventional interpretation of $\\beta$-relaxation as a local process\nis too simplified and provide a clear connection between short-time dynamics\nand long-time structural relaxation in glass-forming liquids.\n", "  We present SIGAME (SImulator of GAlaxy Millimetre/submillimetre Emission), a\nnew numerical code designed to simulate the 12CO rotational line emission\nspectrum of galaxies. Using sub-grid physics recipes to post-process the\noutputs of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, a molecular gas\nphase is condensed out of the hot and partly ionized SPH gas. The gas is\nsubjected to far-UV radiation fields and cosmic ray ionization rates which are\nset to scale with the local star formation rate volume density. Level\npopulations and radiative transport of the CO lines are solved with the 3-D\nradiative transfer code LIME. We have applied SIGAME to cosmological SPH\nsimulations of three disc galaxies at z=2 with stellar masses in the range\n~(0.5-2)x10^11 Msun and star formation rates ~40-140 Msun/yr. Global CO\nluminosities and line ratios are in agreement with observations of disc\ngalaxies at z~2 up to and including J=3-2 but falling short of the few existing\nJ=5-4 observations. The central 5 kpc regions of our galaxies have CO 3-2/1-0\nand 7-6/1-0 brightness temperature ratios of ~0.55-0.65 and ~0.02-0.08,\nrespectively, while further out in the disc the ratios drop to more quiescent\nvalues of ~0.5 and <0.01. Global CO-to-H2 conversion (alpha_CO) factors are\n~=1.5 Msun*pc^2/(K km s/1), i.e. ~2-3 times below typically adopted values for\ndisc galaxies, and alpha_CO increases with radius, in agreement with\nobservations of nearby galaxies. Adopting a top-heavy Giant Molecular Cloud\n(GMC) mass spectrum does not significantly change the results. Steepening the\nGMC density profile leads to higher global line ratios for J_up>=3 and CO-to-H2\nconversion factors [~=3.6 Msun*pc^2/(K km/s)].\n", "  In highest quality organic single-crystal field-effect transistors, electron\ntransport occurs in the band-like regime, with the carrier mobility increasing\nupon lowering temperature. Neither the microscopic nature of this regime, nor\nwhy it occurs only in a small number of materials is currently understood.\nHere, comparative studies of closely related materials, exhibiting high-quality\nreproducible transport properties are needed. We performed a study of electron\ntransport in single-crystals of different TCNQ (tetracyanoquinodimethane)\nmolecules, combined with band structure calculations. We show that F2-TCNQ\ndevices exhibit very high electron mobility and an unprecedented increase in\nmobility upon cooling, whereas in TCNQ and F4-TCNQ the mobility is\nsubstantially lower and decreases upon cooling. We analyze the crystal and\nelectronic structures of these materials and find that F2-TCNQ crystals are\nindeed ideal to achieve outstanding transport properties. Our analysis also\nshows that to understand the difference between the three materials, studying\ntheir band structure is not sufficient, and that the electron-phonon coupling\nneeds to be investigated as well. Besides the outstanding transport properties\nof F2-TCNQ, a key result of our work is the identification of the Fx-TCNQ\nfamily as a paradigm to investigate the most fundamental aspects of electronic\ntransport in organic crystals.\n", "  We present a chemical abundance distribution study in 14 $\\alpha$, odd-Z,\neven-Z, light, and Fe-peak elements of approximately 3200 intermediate\nmetallicity giant stars from the APOGEE survey. The main aim of our analysis is\nto explore the Galactic disk-halo transition region between -1.20 $<$ [Fe/H]\n$<$ -0.55 as a means to study chemical difference (and similarities) between\nthese components. In this paper, we show that there is an $\\alpha$-poor and\n$\\alpha$-rich sequence within both the metal-poor and intermediate metallicity\nregions. Using the Galactic rest-frame radial velocity and spatial positions,\nwe further separate our sample into the canonical Galactic components. We then\nstudied the abundances ratios, of Mg, Ti, Si, Ca, O, S, Al, C+N, Na, Ni, Mn, V,\nand K for each of the components and found the following: (1) the $\\alpha$-poor\nhalo subgroup is chemically distinct in the $\\alpha$-elements (particularly O,\nMg, and S), Al, C+N, and Ni from the $\\alpha$-rich halo, consistent with the\nliterature confirming the existence of an $\\alpha$-poor accreted halo\npopulation; (2) the canonical thick disk and halo are not chemically distinct\nin all elements indicating a smooth transition between the thick disk and halo;\n(3) a subsample of the $\\alpha$-poor stars at metallicities as low as [Fe/H]\n$\\sim$ -0.85 dex are chemically and dynamically consistent with the thin disk\nindicating that the thin disk may extend to lower metallicities than previously\nthought, and (4) that the location of the most metal-poor thin disk stars are\nconsistent with a negative radial metallicity gradient. Finally, we used our\nanalysis to suggest a new set of chemical abundance planes ([$\\alpha$/Fe],\n[C+N/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [Mg/Mn]) that may be able to chemically label the\nGalactic components in a clean and efficient way independent of kinematics.\n", "  Gravitational waves from coalescing binary black holes encode the evolution\nof their spins prior to merger. In the post-Newtonian regime and on the\nprecession timescale, this evolution has one of three morphologies, with the\nspins either librating around one of two fixed points (\"resonances\") or\ncirculating freely. In this work we perform full parameter estimation on\nresonant binaries with fixed masses and spin magnitudes, changing three\nparameters: a conserved \"projected effective spin\" $\\xi$ and resonant family\n$\\Delta\\Phi=0,\\pi$ (which uniquely label the source), the inclination\n$\\theta_{JN}$ of the binary's total angular momentum with respect to the line\nof sight (which determines the strength of precessional effects in the\nwaveform), and the signal amplitude. We demonstrate that resonances can be\ndistinguished for a wide range of binaries, except for highly symmetric\nconfigurations where precessional effects are suppressed. Motivated by new\ninsight into double-spin evolution, we introduce new variables to characterize\nprecessing black hole binaries which naturally reflects the timescale\nseparation of the system and therefore better encode the dynamical information\ncarried by gravitational waves.\n", "  Weyl semimetals (WSM) are topologically protected three dimensional materials\nwhose low energy excitations are linearly dispersing massless Dirac fermions,\npossessing a non-trivial Berry curvature. Using semi-classical Boltzmann\ndynamics in the relaxation time approximation for a lattice model of time\nreversal (TR) symmetry broken WSM, we compute both magnetic field dependent and\nanomalous contributions to the Nernst coefficient. In addition to the magnetic\nfield dependent Nernst response, which is present in both Dirac and Weyl\nsemimetals, we show that, contrary to previous reports, the TR-broken WSM also\nhas an anomalous Nernst response due to a non-vanishing Berry curvature. We\nalso compute the thermal conductivities of a WSM in the Nernst (${\\nabla T}\n\\perp \\mathbf{B}$) and the longitudinal (${\\nabla T} \\parallel \\mathbf{B}$)\nset-up and confirm from our lattice model that in the parallel set-up, the\nWiedemann-Franz law is violated between the longitudinal thermal and electrical\nconductivities due to chiral anomaly.\n", "  We present single-crystal neutron scattering measurements of the spin-1/2\nequilateral triangular lattice antiferromagnet Ba$_3$CoSb$_2$O$_9$. Besides\nconfirming that the Co$^{2+}$ magnetic moments lie in the ab plane for zero\nmagnetic field, we determine all the exchange parameters of the minimal\nquasi-2D spin Hamiltonian, which confirms that Ba$_3$CoSb$_2$O$_9$ is an almost\nperfect realization of the paradigmatic model of frustrated quantum magnetism.\nA comparison with linear and nonlinear spin-wave theory reveals that quantum\nfluctuations induce a strong downward renormalization of the magnon dispersion.\n", "  We point out that the effective channel for the interfacial thermal\nconductance, the inverse of Kapitza resistance, of\nmetal-insulator/semiconductor interfaces is governed by the electron-phonon\ninteraction mediated by the surface states allowed in a thin region near the\ninterface. Our detailed calculations demonstrate that the interfacial thermal\nconductance across Pb/Pt/Al/Au-diamond interfaces are only slightly different\namong these metals, and reproduce well the experimental results of the\ninterfacial thermal conductance across metal-diamond interfaces observed by\nStoner et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 68, 1563 (1992)] and most recently by Hohensee\net al. [Nature Commun. 6, 6578 (2015)].\n", "  We introduce a prescription to compute the entanglement entropy of Galilean\nconformal field theories by combining gravitational anomalies and an\n\\.{I}n\\\"{o}n\\\"{u}-Wigner contraction. We find that our expression for the\nentanglement entropy in the thermal limit reproduces the Cardy formula for\nGalilean conformal field theories. Using this proposal, we calculate the\nentanglement entropy for a class of Galilean conformal field theories, which\nare believed to be dual to three-dimensional flat-space cosmological solutions.\nThese geometries describe expanding (contracting) universes and can be viewed\nas the flat-space limit of rotating Ba\\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black holes.\nWe show that our finding reduces, in the appropriate limits, to the results\ndiscussed in the literature and provide interpretations for the previously\nunexplored regimes, such as flat-space chiral gravity.\n", "  The BaBar, Belle, and LHCb collaborations have reported evidence for new\nphysics in $B\\to D\\tau\\nu$ and $B\\to D^*\\tau\\nu$ of approximately $3.8\\sigma$.\nThere is also the long lasting discrepancy of about $3\\sigma$ in the anomalous\nmagnetic moment of the muon, and the branching ratio for $\\tau\\to\\mu\\nu\\nu$ is\n$1.8\\sigma$ ($2.4\\sigma$) above the Standard Model expectation using the HFAG\n(PDG) values. Furthermore, CMS found hints for a non-zero decay rate of\n$h\\to\\mu\\tau$. Interestingly, all these observations can be explained by\nintroducing new scalars. In this article we consider these processes within a\nlepton-specific two-Higgs doublet model (i.e. of type X) with additional\nnon-standard Yukawa couplings. It is found that one can accommodate\n$\\tau\\to\\mu\\nu\\nu$ with modified Higgs--$\\tau$ couplings. The anomalous\nmagnetic moment of the muon can be explained if the additional neutral CP-even\nHiggs $H$ is light (below 100 GeV). Also $R(D)$ and $R(D^*)$ can be easily\nexplained by additional $t$--$c$--Higgs couplings. Combining these $t$--$c$\ncouplings with a light $H$ the decay rate for $t\\to H c$ can be in a testable\nrange for the LHC. Effects in $h\\to\\mu\\tau$ are also possible, but in this case\na simultaneous explanation of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon is\ndifficult due to the unavoidable $\\tau\\to\\mu\\gamma$ decay.\n", "  Beginning from the Ashtekar formulation of canonical general relativity, we\nderive a physical Hamiltonian written in terms of (classical) loop gravity\nvariables. This is done by gauge-fixing the gravitational fields within a\ncomplex of three-dimensional cells such that curvature and torsion vanish\nwithin each cell. The resulting theory is holographic, with the bulk dynamics\nbeing captured completely by degrees of freedom living on cell boundaries.\nQuantization is readily obtainable by existing methods.\n", "  A discovery of the flavor violating decay h --> tau mu at the LHC would\nrequire extra sources of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) beyond the Higgs\nin order to reconcile it with the bounds from tau --> mu gamma, barring\nfine-tuned cancellations. In fact, an h --> tau mu decay rate at a level\nindicated by the CMS measurement is easily realized if the muon and electron\nmasses are due to a new source of EWSB, while the tau mass is due to the Higgs.\nWe illustrate this with two examples: a two Higgs doublet model, and a model in\nwhich the Higgs is partially composite, with EWSB triggered by a technicolor\nsector. The 1st and 2nd generation quark masses and CKM mixing can also be\nassigned to the new EWSB source. Large deviations in the flavor diagonal lepton\nand quark Higgs Yukawa couplings are generic. If the muon mass is due to a rank\n1 mass matrix contribution, a novel Yukawa coupling sum rule holds, providing a\nprecision test of our framework. Flavor violating quark and lepton\n(pseudo)scalar couplings combine to yield a sizable B_s --> tau mu decay rate,\nwhich could be O(100) times larger than the SM B_s --> mu mu decay rate.\n", "  Very recently, the Belle and BESIII experiments observed a new\ncharmonium-like state $X(3823)$, which is a good candidate for the $D$-wave\ncharmonium $\\psi(1^3D_2)$. Because the $X(3823)$ is just near the $D\\bar{D}^*$\nthreshold, the decay $X(3823)\\to J/\\psi\\pi^+\\pi^-$ can be a golden channel to\ntest the significance of coupled-channel effects. In this work, this decay is\nconsidered including both the hidden-charm dipion and the usual quantum\nchromodynamics multipole expansion (QCDME) contributions. The partial decay\nwidth, the dipion invariant mass spectrum distribution\n$\\mathrm{d}\\Gamma[X(3823)\\to J/\\psi\\pi^+\\pi^-]/\\mathrm{d}m_{\\pi^+\\pi^-}$, and\nthe corresponding $\\mathrm{d}\\Gamma[X(3823)\\to\nJ/\\psi\\pi^+\\pi^-]/\\mathrm{d}\\cos\\theta$ distribution are computed. Many\nparameters are determined from existing experimental data, so the results\ndepend mainly only on one unknown phase between the QCDME and hidden-charm\ndipion amplitudes.\n", "  Reaction-diffusion models are used to describe systems in fields as diverse\nas physics, chemistry, ecology and biology. The fundamental quantities in such\nmodels are individual entities such as atoms and molecules, bacteria, cells or\nanimals, which move and/or react in a stochastic manner. If the number of\nentities is large, accounting for each individual is inefficient, and often\npartial differential equation (PDE) models are used in which the stochastic\nbehaviour of individuals is replaced by a description of the averaged, or mean\nbehaviour of the system. In some situations the number of individuals is large\nin certain regions and small in others. In such cases, a stochastic model may\nbe inefficient in one region, and a PDE model inaccurate in another. To\novercome this problem, we develop a scheme which couples a stochastic\nreaction-diffusion system in one part of the domain with its mean field\nanalogue, i.e. a discretised PDE model, in the other part of the domain. The\ninterface in between the two domains occupies exactly one lattice site and is\nchosen such that the mean field description is still accurate there. This way\nerrors due to the flux between the domains are small. Our scheme can account\nfor multiple dynamic interfaces separating multiple stochastic and\ndeterministic domains, and the coupling between the domains conserves the total\nnumber of particles. The method preserves stochastic features such as\nextinction not observable in the mean field description, and is significantly\nfaster to simulate on a computer than the pure stochastic model.\n", "  Based on low temperature resistivity, heat capacity and magnetization\ninvestigations we show that the unusually strong suppression of\nsuperconductivity in Lu$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$B$_{12}$ BSC-type superconductors in the\nrange $x$$<$0.08 is caused by the emergence of static spin polarization in the\nvicinity of non-magnetic lutetium impurities. The analysis of received results\npoints to a formation of static magnetic moments with\n$\\mu_{eff}$$\\approx$$3\\mu_B$ per Lu-ion. The size of these spin polarized\nnanodomains was estimated to be about 5 ${\\AA}$.\n", "  We analyze the effects of finite-range corrections in halo effective field\ntheory for S-wave proton halo nuclei. We calculate the charge radius to\nnext-to-leading order and the astrophysical S-factor for low-energy proton\ncapture to fifth order in the low-energy expansion. As an application, we\nconfront our results with experimental data for the S-factor for proton capture\non Oxygen-16 into the excited $1/2^+$ state of Fluorine-17. Our low-energy\ntheory is characterized by a systematic low-energy expansion, which can be used\nto quantify an energy-dependent model error to be utilized in data fitting.\nFinally, we show that the existence of proton halos is suppressed by the need\nfor two fine tunings in the underlying theory.\n", "  In the presence of both direct and indirect unitarity violation in the lepton\nmixing matrix, we derive a complete set of series expansion formulas for\nneutrino oscillation probabilities in matter of constant density. Expansions in\nthe mass hierarchy parameter $\\alpha \\equiv \\Delta m_{21}^{2} / \\Delta\nm_{31}^{2}$ and those unitarity violation parameters $s^{2}_{ij}$ (for i = 1,\n2, 3 and j = 4, 5, 6) up to the first order are studied in this paper. We\nanalyse the accuracy of the analytical series expansion formulas in different\nregions of L / E. A detailed numerical analysis is also performed, of which the\ndifferent effects of the direct and the indirect unitarity violation are\nparticularly emphasized. We also study in this paper the summed\n$\\nu^{}_{\\alpha} \\rightarrow \\nu^{}_{e, \\nu, \\tau}$ probabilities, whose\ndeviation from the unity provides a definite signal of the unitarity violation.\n", "  We perform state-of-the-art calculations for a prototypical dye sensitized\nsolar cell: catechol on rutile TiO$_2$(110). Catechol is often used as an\nanchoring group for larger more complex organic and inorganic dyes on TiO$_2$\nand forms a type II heterojunctions on TiO$_2$(110). In particular, we compare\nquasiparticle (QP) $G_0W_0$ with hybrid exchange correlation functional (HSE)\ndensity functional theory (DFT) calculations for the catechol-rutile\nTiO$_2$(110) interface. In so doing, we provide a theoretical interpretation of\nultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) and inverse photoemission\nspectroscopy (IPES) experiments for this prototypical system. Specifically, we\ndemonstrate that the position, presence, and intensity of peaks associated with\ncatechol's HOMO, intermolecular OH$-$O bonds, and interfacial hydrogen bonds to\nthe surface bridging O atoms (O$_{br}$H$-$C and O$_{br}$H$-$O) may be used to\nfingerprint deprotonation of catechol's OH anchoring groups. Furthermore, our\nresults suggest deprotonation of these groups, while being nearly isoenergetic\nat high coverages, may significantly increase the photovoltaic efficiency of\ncatechol$-$TiO$_2$(110) interfaces.\n", "  Galactic Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are copious sources of gamma-rays that can\npose a threat to complex life. Using recent determinations of their rate and\nthe probability of GRBs causing massive extinction, we explore what type of\nuniverses are most likely to harbour advanced forms of life. For this purpose\nwe use cosmological N-body simulations to determine at what time and for what\nvalue of the cosmological constant ($\\Lambda$) the chances of life being\nunaffected by cosmic explosions are maximised. We find that $\\Lambda-$dominated\nuniverses favour the survival of life against GRBs. Within a $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmology, the parameters that govern the likelihood of life survival to GRBs\nare dictated by the value of $\\Lambda$ and the age of the Universe. We find\nthat we seem to live in a favorable point in this parameter phase space which\nminimises the exposure to cosmic explosions, yet maximises the number of main\nsequence (hydrogen-burning) stars around which advanced life forms can exist.\n", "  Observations at low redshifts thus far fail to account for all of the baryons\nexpected in the Universe according to cosmological constraints. A large\nfraction of the baryons presumably resides in a thin and warm-hot medium\nbetween the galaxies, where they are difficult to observe due to their low\ndensities and high temperatures. Cosmological simulations of structure\nformation can be used to verify this picture and provide quantitative\npredictions for the distribution of mass in different large-scale structure\ncomponents. Here we study the distribution of baryons and dark matter at\ndifferent epochs using data from the Illustris simulation. We identify regions\nof different dark matter density with the primary constituents of large-scale\nstructure, allowing us to measure mass and volume of haloes, filaments and\nvoids. At redshift zero, we find that 49 % of the dark matter and 23 % of the\nbaryons are within haloes more massive than the resolution limit of $2\\times\n10^8$ M$_\\odot$. The filaments of the cosmic web host a further 45 % of the\ndark matter and 46 % of the baryons. The remaining 31 % of the baryons reside\nin voids. The majority of these baryons have been transported there through\nactive galactic nuclei feedback. We note that the feedback model of Illustris\nis too strong for heavy haloes, therefore it is likely that we are\noverestimating this amount. Categorizing the baryons according to their density\nand temperature, we find that 17.8 % of them are in a condensed state, 21.6 %\nare present as cold, diffuse gas, and 53.9 % are found in the state of a\nwarm-hot intergalactic medium.\n", "  The Leggett-Garg (LG) inequalities were proposed in order to assess whether\nsets of pairs of sequential measurements on a single quantum system can be\nconsistent with an underlying notion of macrorealism. Here, the LG inequalities\nare explored using a simple quasi-probability linear in the projection\noperators to describe the properties of the system at two times. We show that\nthis quasi-probability is measurable, has the same correlation function as the\nusual two-time measurement probability (for the bivalent variables considered\nhere) and has the key property that the probabilities for the later time are\nindependent of whether an earlier measurement was made, a generalization of the\nno-signalling in time condition of Kofler and Brukner. We argue that this\nquasi-probability, appropriately measured, provides a non-invasive measure of\nmacrorealism per se at the two time level. This measure, when combined with the\nLG inequalities, provides a characterization of macrorealism more detailed than\nthat provided by the LG inequalities alone. When the quasi-probability is\nnon-negative, the LG system has a natural parallel with the EPRB system and\nFine's theorem. A simple spin model illustrating key features of the approach\nis exhibited.\n", "  We analyse the effect of intrinsic fluctuations on the properties of bistable\nstochastic systems with time scale separation operating under1 quasi-steady\nstate conditions. We first formulate a stochastic generalisation of the\nquasi-steady state approximation based on the semi-classical approximation of\nthe partial differential equation for the generating function associated with\nthe Chemical Master Equation. Such approximation proceeds by optimising an\naction functional whose associated set of Euler-Lagrange (Hamilton) equations\nprovide the most likely fluctuation path. We show that, under appropriate\nconditions granting time scale separation, the Hamiltonian can be re-scaled so\nthat the set of Hamilton equations splits up into slow and fast variables,\nwhereby the quasi-steady state approximation can be applied. We analyse two\nparticular examples of systems whose mean-field limit has been shown to exhibit\nbi-stability: an enzyme-catalysed system of two mutually-inhibitory proteins\nand a gene regulatory circuit with self-activation. Our theory establishes that\nthe number of molecules of the conserved species are order parameters whose\nvariation regulates bistable behaviour in the associated systems beyond the\npredictions of the mean-field theory. This prediction is fully confirmed by\ndirect numerical simulations using the stochastic simulation algorithm. This\nresult allows us to propose strategies whereby, by varying the number of\nmolecules of the three conserved chemical species, cell properties associated\nto bistable behaviour (phenotype, cell-cycle status, etc.) can be controlled.\n", "  We show that a composite spin-1/2 Kondo system can be formed by coupling a\nsuperconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) to the internal hyperfine\nstates of a trapped ultracold atomic Fermi gas. Here, the SQUID, or flux qubit,\nacts as an effective magnetic impurity that induces spin-flip scattering near\nthe Fermi energies of the trapped gas. Although the ultracold gas and SQUID are\nat vastly different temperatures, the formation of a strongly correlated Kondo\nstate between the two systems is found when the gas is cooled below the Kondo\ntemperature; this temperature regime is within current experimental limits.\nFurthermore, the momentum distribution of the trapped fermions is calculated.\nWe find that it clearly contains an experimental signature of this correlated\nstate and the associated Kondo screening length. In addition to probing Kondo\nphysics, the controllability of this system can be used to systematically\nexplore the relaxation and equilibration of a strongly correlated system that\nhas been initially prepared in a selected nonequilibrium state.\n", "  We consider a question motivated by the third law of thermodynamics: can\nthere be a local temperature arbitrarily close to absolute zero in a\nnonequilibrium quantum system? We consider nanoscale quantum conductors with\nthe source reservoir held at finite temperature and the drain held at or near\nabsolute zero, a problem outside the scope of linear response theory. We obtain\nlocal temperatures close to absolute zero when electrons originating from the\nfinite temperature reservoir undergo destructive quantum interference. The\nlocal temperature is computed by numerically solving a nonlinear system of\nequations describing equilibration of a scanning thermoelectric probe with the\nsystem, and we obtain excellent agreement with analytic results derived using\nthe Sommerfeld expansion. A local entropy for a nonequilibrium quantum system\nis introduced, and used as a metric quantifying the departure from local\nequilibrium. It is shown that the local entropy of the system tends to zero\nwhen the probe temperature tends to zero, consistent with the third law of\nthermodynamics.\n", "  We visualize the Kohn-Sham kinetic energy density (KED), and the ingredients\n-- the electron density, its gradient and Laplacian -- used to construct\norbital-free models of it, for the AE6 test set of molecules. These are\ncompared to related quantities used in metaGGA's, to characterize two important\nlimits -- the gradient expansion and the localized-electron limit typified by\nthe covalent bond. We find the second-order gradient expansion of the KED to be\na surprisingly successful predictor of the exact KED, particularly at low\ndensities where this approximation fails for exchange. This contradicts the\nconjointness conjecture that the optimal enhancement factors for orbital-free\nkinetic and exchange energy functionals are identical. In addition we find\nsignificant problems with a recent metaGGA-level orbital-free KED, especially\nfor regions of strong electron localization. We define an orbital-free\ndescription of electron localization and a revised metaGGA that improves upon\natomization energies significantly.\n", "  We discuss massive quark effects in the endpoint region $x \\to 1$ of\ninclusive deep inelastic scattering, where the hadronic final state is\ncollimated and thus represents a jet. In this regime heavy quark pairs are\ngenerated via secondary radiation, i.e. due to a gluon splitting in light quark\ninitiated contributions starting at $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$ in the\nfixed-order expansion. Based on the factorization framework for massless quarks\nin Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET), we construct a variable flavor\nnumber scheme that deals with arbitrary hierarchies between the mass scale and\nthe kinematic scales exhibiting a continuous behavior between the massless\nlimit for very light quarks and the decoupling limit for very heavy quarks. We\nshow that the threshold matching corrections for all gauge invariant components\nat the mass scale are related to each other via consistency conditions. This is\nexplicitly demonstrated by recalculating the known threshold correction for the\nparton distribution function at $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^2 C_F T_F)$ within SCET.\nThe latter contains large rapidity logarithms $\\sim \\ln(1-x)$ that can be\nsummed by exponentiation. Their coefficients are universal which can be used to\nobtain potentially relevant higher order results for generic threshold\ncorrections at colliders from computations in deep inelastic scattering. In\nparticular, we extract the $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha_s^3)$ threshold correction\nmultiplied by a single rapidity logarithm from results obtained earlier.\n", "  We have developed a self-consistent description of the radiation heat\ntransfer and dynamics of large perfectly black spherical bodies with sizes much\ngreater than the characteristic wavelength of radiation moving in a photon gas\nwith relativistic velocity. The results can be important in astrophysics.\n", "  We search for dynamical magnetoelectric phenomena in three-dimensional\ncorrelated systems with spin-orbit coupling. We focus on the antiferromagnetic\ninsulator phases where the dynamical axion field is realized by the fluctuation\nof the antiferromagnetic order parameter. It is shown that the dynamical chiral\nmagnetic effect, an alternating current generation by magnetic fields, emerges\ndue to the time dependences of the order parameter such as antiferromagnetic\nresonance. It is also shown that the anomalous Hall effect arises due to the\nspatial variations of the order parameter such as antiferromagnetic domain\nwalls. Our study indicates that spin excitations in antiferromagnetic\ninsulators with spin-orbit coupling can result in nontrivial charge responses.\nMoreover, observing the chiral magnetic effect and anomalous Hall effect in our\nsystem is equivalent to detecting the dynamical axion field in condensed\nmatter.\n", "  The empirical absence to date of particles obeying parastatistics in high\nenergy collider experiments might be due to their large masses, weak scale\ncouplings, and lack of gauge couplings. Paraparticles of order p=2 must be pair\nproduced, so the lightest such particles are absolutely stable and so are\nexcellent candidates to be associated with dark matter and/or dark energy. If\nthere is a portal to such particles, from a new scalar A1 boson they might be\ncascade emitted as a pair of para-Majorana neutrinos as in A1 ---> A2 para-nu\npara-nu or as a pair of neutral spin-zero paraparticles such as in A1 ---> A2\npara-A para-B, where para-B is the anti-paraparticle to para-A. In this paper,\nfor an assumed supersymmetric-like \"statistics portal\" Lagrangian, the\nassociated connected tree diagrams and their parastatistical factors are\nobtained for the case of order p=2 parastatistics. These factors are compared\nwith the corresponding statistical factors for the analogous emission of a\nnon-degenerate or a 2-fold degenerate pair which obey normal statistics. This\nshows that diagrams, and diagrammatic thinking, can be use in perturbatively\nanalyzing paraparticle processes. The parastatistical factor associated with\neach diagram does require explicit calculation.\n", "  Binary black hole coalescence has its peak of gravitational wave generation\nduring the \"plunge,\" the transition from quasicircular early motion to late\nquasinormal ringing. Although advances in numerical relativity have provided\nplunge waveforms, there is still no intuitive or phenomenological understanding\nof plungecomparable to that of the early and late stages. Here we make progress\nin developing such understanding by focusing on the excitation of quasinormal\nringing (QNR) during the plunge. We rely on insights of the linear mathematics\nof the particle perturbation model for the extreme mass limit. Our analysis,\nbased on the Fourier domain Green function, and a simple initial model, point\nto the crucial role played by the kinematics near the \"light ring\" (the\ncircular photon orbit) in determining the excitation of QNR. That insight is\nthen shown to successfully explain Schwarzschild QNR found with evolution\ncodes. Lastly, a phenomenological explanation is given for the underlying\nimportance of the light ring.\n", "  Quantum random number generators can provide genuine randomness by appealing\nto the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. In general, a physical\ngenerator contains two parts---a randomness source and its readout. The source\nis essential to the quality of the resulting random numbers; hence, it needs to\nbe carefully calibrated and modeled to achieve information-theoretical provable\nrandomness. However, in practice, the source is a complicated physical system,\nsuch as a light source or an atomic ensemble, and any deviations in the\nreal-life implementation from the theoretical model may affect the randomness\nof the output. To close this gap, we propose a source-independent scheme for\nquantum random number generation in which output randomness can be certified,\neven when the source is uncharacterized and untrusted. In our randomness\nanalysis, we make no assumptions about the dimension of the source. For\ninstance, multiphoton emissions are allowed in optical implementations. Our\nanalysis takes into account the finite-key effect with the composable security\ndefinition. In the limit of large data size, the length of the input random\nseed is exponentially small compared to that of the output random bit. In\naddition, by modifying a quantum key distribution system, we experimentally\ndemonstrate our scheme and achieve a randomness generation rate of over\n$5\\times 10^3$ bit/s.\n", "  We investigate physical properties of molecular clouds in disc galaxies with\ndifferent morphology: a galaxy without prominent structure, a spiral barred\ngalaxy and a galaxy with flocculent structure. Our $N$-body/hydrodynamical\nsimulations take into account non-equilibrium H$_2$ and CO chemical kinetics,\nself-gravity, star formation and feedback processes. For the simulated galaxies\nthe scaling relations of giant molecular clouds or so called Larson's relations\nare studied for two types of a cloud definition (or extraction methods): the\nfirst one is based on total column density position-position (PP) datasets and\nthe second one is indicated by the CO~(1-0) line emission used\nposition-position-velocity (PPV) data. We find that the cloud populations\nobtained by using both cloud extraction methods generally have similar physical\nparameters. Except that for the CO data the mass spectrum of clouds has a tail\nwith low-massive objects $M\\sim 10^3-10^4$~\\Msun. Varying column density\nthreshold the power-law indices in the scaling relations are significantly\nchanged. In contrast, the relations are invariant to CO brightness temperature\nthreshold. Finally, we find that the mass spectra of clouds for the PPV data\nare almost insensitive to the galactic morphology, whereas the spectra for the\nPP data demonstrate significant variations.\n", "  Heavy fermion (HF) materials exhibit a rich array of phenomena due to the\nstrong Kondo coupling between their localized moments and itinerant electrons.\nA central question in their study is to understand the interplay between\nmagnetic order and charge transport, and its role in stabilizing new quantum\nphases of matter. Particularly promising in this regard is a family of\ntetragonal intermetallic compounds Ce{$TX$}$_2$ ($T=$ transition metal, $X=$\npnictogen), that includes a variety of HF compounds showing $T$-linear\nelectronic specific heat $\\bf{C_e \\sim \\gamma T}$, with $\\gamma\\sim$ 20-500\nmJ$\\cdot$mol$^{-1}$~K$^{-2}$, reflecting an effective mass enhancement ranging\nfrom small to modest. Here, we study the low-temperature field-tuned phase\ndiagram of high-quality CeAgBi$_2$ using magnetometry and transport\nmeasurements. We find an antiferromagnetic transition at ${T_{N} = 6.4}$~K with\nweak magnetic anisotropy and the easy axis along the $c$-axis, similar to\nprevious reports (${T_{N} = 6.1}$~K). This scenario, along with the presence of\ntwo anisotropic Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions, leads to a\nrich field-tuned magnetic phase diagram, consisting of five metamagnetic\ntransitions of both first and second order. In addition, we unveil an anomalous\nHall contribution for fields $H<54$ kOe which is drastically altered when $H$\nis tuned through a trio of transitions at 57, 78, and 84~kOe, suggesting that\nthe Fermi surface is reconstructed in a subset of the metamagnetic transitions.\n", "  Maxwell's equations cannot describe a homogeneous and isotropic universe with\na uniformly distributed net charge, because the electromagnetic field tensor in\nsuch a universe must be vanishing everywhere. For a closed universe with a\nnonzero net charge, Maxwell's equations always fail regardless of the spacetime\nsymmetry and the charge distribution. The two paradoxes indicate that Maxwell's\nequations need be modified to be applicable to the universe as a whole. We\nconsider two types of modified Maxwell equations, both can address the\nparadoxes. One is the Proca-type equation which contains a photon mass term.\nThis type of electromagnetic field equations can naturally arise from\nspontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism in quantum field theory,\nwhere photons acquire a mass by eating massless Goldstone bosons. However,\nphotons loose their mass when symmetry is restored, and the paradoxes reappear.\nThe other type of modified Maxwell equations, which are more attractive in our\nopinions, contain a term with the electromagnetic potential vector coupled to\nthe spacetime curvature tensor. This type of electromagnetic field equations do\nnot introduce a new dimensional parameter and return to Maxwell's equations in\na flat or Ricci-flat spacetime. We show that the curvature-coupled term can\nnaturally arise from the ambiguity in extending Maxwell's equations from a flat\nspacetime to a curved spacetime through the minimal substitution rule. Some\nconsequences of the modified Maxwell equations are investigated. The results\nshow that for reasonable parameters the modification does not affect existing\nexperiments and observations. However, the field equations with a\ncurvature-coupled term can be testable in astrophysical environments where mass\ndensity is high or the gravity of electromagnetic radiation plays a dominant\nrole in dynamics, e.g., interior of neutron stars and the early universe.\n", "  The phonon properties, electronic structures and optical properties of novel\ncarbon allotropes, such as monolayer penta-graphene (PG), double-layer PG and\nT12-carbon, were explored by means of first-principles calculations. Results of\nphonon calculations demonstrate that these exotic carbon allotropes are\ndynamically stable. In addition, the bulk T12 phase is an indirect-gap\nsemiconductor having a bandgap of ~4.89 eV. Whereas the bulk material\ntransforms to a 2D phase, the monolayer and double-layer PG become quasi-direct\ngap semiconductors with smaller band gaps of ~2.64 eV and ~3.27eV,\nrespectively. Furthermore, the partial charge density analysis indicates that\nthe 2D phases retain part of the electronic characteristics of the T12 phase.\nThe linear photon energy-dependent dielectric functions and related optical\nproperties including refractive index, extinction coefficient, absorption\nspectrum, reflectivity, and energy loss spectrum were also computed and\ndiscussed. The structural estimation obtained as well as other findings are in\nagreement with existing theoretical data. The calculated results are beneficial\nto the practical applications of these exotic carbon allotropes in\noptoelectronics and electronics.\n", "  The natural excitations of an interacting one-dimensional system at low\nenergy are hydrodynamic modes of Luttinger liquid, protected by the Lorentz\ninvariance of the linear dispersion. We show that beyond low energies, where\nquadratic dispersion reduces the symmetry to Galilean, the main character of\nthe many-body excitations changes into a hierarchy: calculations of dynamic\ncorrelation functions for fermions (without spin) show that the spectral\nweights of the excitations are proportional to powers of\n$\\mathcal{R}^{2}/L^{2}$, where $\\mathcal{R}$ is a length-scale related to\ninteractions and $L$ is the system length. Thus only small numbers of\nexcitations carry the principal spectral power in representative regions on the\nenergy-momentum planes. We have analysed the spectral function in detail and\nhave shown that the first-level (strongest) excitations form a mode with\nparabolic dispersion, like that of a renormalised single particle. The\nsecond-level excitations produce a singular power-law line shape to the\nfirst-level mode and multiple power-laws at the spectral edge. We have\nillustrated crossover to Luttinger liquid at low energy by calculating the\nlocal density of state through all energy scales: from linear to non-linear,\nand to above the chemical potential energies. In order to test this model, we\nhave carried out experiments to measure momentum-resolved tunnelling of\nelectrons (fermions with spin) from/to a wire formed within a GaAs\nheterostructure. We observe well-resolved spin-charge separation at low energy\nwith appreciable interaction strength and only a parabolic dispersion of the\nfirst-level mode at higher energies. We find structure resembling the\nsecond-level excitations, which dies away rapidly at high momentum in line with\nthe theoretical predictions here.\n", "  We consider magnetization configurations at chiral magnet (CM)/ferromagnet\n(FM) heterostructures. In the CM, magnetic skyrmions and spin helices emerge\ndue to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which then penetrate into the\nadjacent FM. However, because the non-uniform magnetization structures are\nenergetically unfavorable in the FM, the penetrated magnetization structures\nare deformed, resulting in exotic three-dimensional configurations, such as\nskyrmion cones, sideways skyrmions, and twisted helices and skyrmions. We\ndiscuss the stability of possible magnetization configurations at the CM/FM and\nCM/FM/CM hybrid structures within the framework of the variational method, and\nfind that various magnetization configurations appear in the ground state, some\nof which cause nontrivial emergent magnetic field.\n", "  There are indications of formation of a thermalized medium in high\nmultiplicity pp collisions at LHC energy. It is possible that such a medium may\nreach high enough energy density/temperature so that a transient stage of\nquark-gluon plasma, where chiral symmetry is restored, may be achieved. Due to\nrapid 3-dimensional expansion, the system will quickly cool undergoing\nspontaneous chiral symmetry breaking transition. We study the dynamics of\nchiral field, after the symmetry breaking transition, for such an event using\nreaction-diffusion equation approach which we have recently applied for\nstudying QCD transitions in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We show that the\ninterior of such a rapidly expanding system is likely to lead to the formation\nof a single large domain of disoriented chiral condensate (DCC) which has been\na subject of intensive search in earlier experiments. We argue that large\nmultiplicity pp collisions naturally give rise to required boundary conditions\nfor the existence of slowly propagating front solutions of reaction-diffusion\nequation with resulting dynamics of chiral field leading to the formation of a\nlarge DCC domain.\n", "  Opto-electronic devices utilizing graphene have already demonstrated unique\ncapabilities, which are much more difficult to realize with conventional\ntechnologies. However, the requirements in terms of material quality and\nuniformity are very demanding. A major roadblock towards high-performance\ndevices are the nanoscale variations of graphene properties, which strongly\nimpact the macroscopic device behaviour. Here, we present and apply\nopto-electronic nanoscopy to measure locally both the optical and electronic\nproperties of graphene devices. This is achieved by combining scanning\nnear-field infrared nanoscopy with electrical device read-out, allowing\ninfrared photocurrent mapping at length scales of tens of nanometers. We apply\nthis technique to study the impact of edges and grain boundaries on spatial\ncarrier density profiles and local thermoelectric properties. Moreover, we show\nthat the technique can also be applied to encapsulated graphene/hexagonal boron\nnitride (h-BN) devices, where we observe strong charge build-up near the edges,\nand also address a device solution to this problem. The technique enables\nnanoscale characterization for a broad range of common graphene devices without\nthe need of special device architectures or invasive graphene treatment.\n", "  Most proteins must remain soluble in the cytosol in order to perform their\nbiological functions. To protect against undesired protein aggregation, living\ncells maintain a population of molecular chaperones that ensure the solubility\nof the proteome. Here we report simulations of a lattice model of interacting\nproteins to understand how low concentrations of passive molecular chaperones,\nsuch as small heat-shock proteins, suppress thermodynamic instabilities in\nprotein solutions. Given fixed concentrations of chaperones and client\nproteins, the solubility of the proteome can be increased by tuning the\nchaperone--client binding strength. Surprisingly, we find that the binding\nstrength that optimizes solubility while preventing irreversible chaperone\nbinding also promotes the formation of weakly bound chaperone oligomers,\nalthough the presence of these oligomers does not significantly affect the\nthermodynamic stability of the solution. Such oligomers are commonly observed\nin experiments on small heat-shock proteins, but their connection to the\nbiological function of these chaperones has remained unclear. Our simulations\nsuggest that this clustering may not have any essential biological function,\nbut rather emerges as a natural side-effect of optimizing the thermodynamic\nstability of the proteome.\n", "  Light scalar fields such as axions and string moduli can play an important\nrole in early-universe cosmology. However, many factors can significantly\nimpact their late-time cosmological abundances. For example, in cases where the\npotentials for these fields are generated dynamically --- such as during\ncosmological mass-generating phase transitions --- the duration of the time\ninterval required for these potentials to fully develop can have significant\nrepercussions. Likewise, in scenarios with multiple scalars, mixing amongst the\nfields can also give rise to an effective timescale that modifies the resulting\nlate-time abundances. Previous studies have focused on the effects of either\nthe first or the second timescale in isolation. In this paper, by contrast, we\nexamine the new features that arise from the interplay between these two\ntimescales when both mixing and time-dependent phase transitions are introduced\ntogether. First, we find that the effects of these timescales can conspire to\nalter not only the total late-time abundance of the system --- often by many\norders of magnitude --- but also its distribution across the different fields.\nSecond, we find that these effects can produce large parametric resonances\nwhich render the energy densities of the fields highly sensitive to the degree\nof mixing as well as the duration of the time interval over which the phase\ntransition unfolds. Finally, we find that these effects can even give rise to a\n\"re-overdamping\" phenomenon which causes the total energy density of the system\nto behave in novel ways that differ from those exhibited by pure dark matter or\nvacuum energy. All of these features therefore give rise to new possibilities\nfor early-universe phenomenology and cosmological evolution. They also\nhighlight the importance of taking into account the time dependence associated\nwith phase transitions in cosmological settings.\n", "  This paper is the third in a series presenting the results of direct\nnumerical integrations of the Fokker-Planck equation for stars orbiting a\nsupermassive black hole (SBH) at the center of a galaxy. The algorithm of Paper\nII included diffusion coefficients that described the effects of random\n(\"classical\") and correlated (\"resonant\") relaxation. In this paper, the\ndiffusion coefficients of Paper II have been generalized to account for the\neffects of \"anomalous relaxation,\" the qualitatively different way in which\neccentric orbits evolve in the regime of rapid relativistic precession. Two\nfunctional forms for the anomalous diffusion coefficients are investigated,\nbased on power-law or exponential modifications of the resonant diffusion\ncoefficients. The parameters defining the modified coefficients are first\nconstrained by comparing the results of Fokker-Planck integrations with\npreviously-published N-body integrations. Steady-state solutions are then\nobtained via the Fokker-Planck equation for models with properties similar to\nthose of the Milky Way nucleus. Inclusion of anomalous relaxation leads to the\nformation of less prominent cores than in the case of resonant relaxation\nalone, due to the lengthening of diffusion timescales for eccentric orbits.\nSteady-state capture rates of stars by the SBH are found to always be less, by\nas much as an order of magnitude, than capture rates in the presence of\nresonant relaxation alone.\n", "  Intensity mapping of neutral hydrogen (HI) is a promising observational probe\nof cosmology and large-scale structure. We present wide field simulations of HI\nintensity maps based on N-body simulations of a $2.6\\, {\\rm Gpc / h}$ box with\n$2048^3$ particles (particle mass $1.6 \\times 10^{11}\\, {\\rm M_\\odot / h}$).\nUsing a conditional mass function to populate the simulated dark matter density\nfield with halos below the mass resolution of the simulation ($10^{8}\\, {\\rm\nM_\\odot / h} < M_{\\rm halo} < 10^{13}\\, {\\rm M_\\odot / h}$), we assign HI to\nthose halos according to a phenomenological halo to HI mass relation. The\nsimulations span a redshift range of 0.35 < z < 0.9 in redshift bins of width\n$\\Delta z \\approx 0.05$ and cover a quarter of the sky at an angular resolution\nof about 7'. We use the simulated intensity maps to study the impact of\nnon-linear effects and redshift space distortions on the angular clustering of\nHI. Focusing on the autocorrelations of the maps, we apply and compare several\nestimators for the angular power spectrum and its covariance. We verify that\nthese estimators agree with analytic predictions on large scales and study the\nvalidity of approximations based on Gaussian random fields, particularly in the\ncontext of the covariance. We discuss how our results and the simulated maps\ncan be useful for planning and interpreting future HI intensity mapping\nsurveys.\n", "  Ultra-thin 3D topological insulators provide a stage to study the surface\nphysics of such materials by minimizing the bulk contribution. Further, the\nexperimentally verified snowflake like structure of the Fermi surface leads to\na hexagonal warping term, and this discourse examines it as a perturbation in\nthe presence of a magnetic field. We find that there are corrections to both\nenergy dispersion and eigenstates which in turn alter the density of states in\nthe presence of a magnetic field. Both the quantum capacitance and the Hall\ncoefficient are evaluated analytically and it is shown here that we recover\ntheir established forms along with small corrections which preserve the object\nof treating hexagonal warping perturbatively. In our approach, the established\nHall conductivity expression develops several minute correction terms and thus\nits behavior remains largely unaffected due to warping. The zero-temperature\nquantum capacitance exhibits SdH oscillations with reduced frequencies, with a\nlowered average capacitance with increased warping of the Fermi surface, while\nmaintaining the usual amplitudes.\n", "  Branching random walks on multidimensional lattice with heavy tails and a\nconstant branching rate are considered. It is shown that under these conditions\n(heavy tails and constant rate), the front propagates exponentially fast, but\nthe particles inside of the front are distributed very non-uniformly. The\nparticles exhibit intermittent behavior in a large part of the region behind\nthe front (i.e., the particles are concentrated only in very sparse spots\nthere). The zone of non-intermittency (were particles are distributed\nrelatively uniformly) extends with a power rate. This rate is found.\n", "  Resonant exchange qubits are a promising addition to the family of\nexperimentally implemented encodings of single qubits using semiconductor\nquantum dots. We have shown previously that it ought to be straightforward to\nperform a CPHASE gate between two resonant exchange qubits with a single\nexchange pulse. This approach uses energy gaps to suppress leakage rather than\nconventional pulse sequences. In this paper we present analysis and simulations\nof our proposed two-qubit gate subject to charge and Overhauser field noise at\nlevels observed in current experiments. Our main result is that we expect\nimplementations of our two-qubit gate to achieve high fidelities, with errors\nat the percent level and gate times comparable to single-qubit operations. As\nsuch, exchange-coupled resonant exchange qubits remain an attractive approach\nfor quantum computing.\n", "  By studying young magnetically active late-type stars, i.e. analogues to the\nyoung Sun, one can draw conclusions on the evolution of the solar dynamo. We\ndetermine the topology of the surface magnetic field and study the relation\nbetween the magnetic field and cool photospheric spots in three young late-type\nstars. High-resolution spectropolarimetry of the targets were obtained with the\nHARPSpol instrument mounted at the ESO 3.6 m telescope. The signal-to-noise\nratio of the Stokes IV measurements were boosted by combining the signal from a\nlarge number of spectroscopic absorption lines through the least squares\ndeconvolution technique. Surface brightness and magnetic field maps were\ncalculated using the Zeeman-Doppler imaging technique. All the three targets\nshow clear signs of both magnetic fields and cool spots. Only one of the\ntargets, namely V1358 Ori, shows evidence of the dominance of non-axisymmetric\nmodes. In two of the targets, the poloidal field is significantly stronger than\nthe toroidal one, indicative of an $\\alpha^2$-type of a dynamo, in which\nconvective turbulence effects dominate over the weak differential rotation. In\ntwo of the cases there is a slight anti-correlation between the cool spots and\nthe strength of the radial magnetic field. However, even in these cases the\ncorrelation is much weaker than in the case of sunspots. The weak correlation\nbetween the measured radial magnetic field and cool spots may indicate a more\ncomplex magnetic field structure in the spots or spot groups involving mixed\nmagnetic polarities. Comparison with a previously published magnetic field map\nshows that on one of the stars, HD 29615, the underlying magnetic field has\nchanged its polarity between 2009 and 2013.\n", "  We present a time-dependent calculation of the velocity-dependent forces\nwhich act on an excited atomic dipole in relative motion with respect to ground\nstate atoms of a different kind. Both, its interaction with a single atom and\nwith a dilute atomic plate are evaluated. In either case, the total force\nconsists of a conservative van der Waals component and a non-conservative\nRontgen component. On physical grounds, the former corresponds to the\nvelocity-dependent recoil experienced by the excited atom in the processes of\nabsorption and emission of the photons that it exchanges with the ground state\natoms on a periodic basis. The latter corresponds to the time-variation of the\nRontgen momentum, which is also mediated by the periodic exchange of\nquasi-resonant photons. We find that, at leading order, all these interactions\nare linear in the velocity. In the non-retarded regime the van der Waals force\ndominates, being antiparallel to the velocity. On the contrary, in the retarded\nregime the velocity-dependent forces oscillate in space, van der Waals and\nRontgen forces are of the same order in the atom-atom interaction, and the\nRontgen component dominates in the atom-surface interaction.\n", "  Ferromagnetic contacts are widely used to inject spin polarized currents into\nnon-magnetic materials such as semiconductors or 2-dimensional materials like\ngraphene. In these systems, oxidation of the ferromagnetic materials poses an\nintrinsic limitation on device performance. Here we investigate the role of\nex-situ transferred chemical vapour deposited hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) as\nan oxidation barrier for nanostructured cobalt and permalloy electrodes. The\nchemical state of the ferromagnets was investigated using X-ray photoemission\nelectron microscopy owing to its high sensitivity and lateral resolution. We\nhave compared the oxide thickness formed on ferromagnetic nanostructures\ncovered by hBN to uncovered reference structures. Our results show that hBN\nreduces the oxidation rate of ferromagnetic nanostructures suggesting that it\ncould be used as an ultra-thin protection layer in future spintronic devices.\n", "  A commentary on the article \"Large-scale evidence of dependency length\nminimization in 37 languages\" by Futrell, Mahowald & Gibson (PNAS 2015 112 (33)\n10336-10341).\n", "  The usual treatments of the neutrino flavor-evolution, beyond a surface above\nthe last scattering, assume identical angular distributions at this distance\nfor the different initial (unmixed) flavors, and for particles and\nantiparticles. Taking into account differences in these distributions that must\nbe present, as a result of the species-dependent scattering cross-sections\nlower down in the star, leads to a new set of non-linear equations. These\nequations are unstable, even at the initial surface, with respect to\nperturbations that have both tiny mixing from neutrino oscillations and that\nbreak all-over spherical-symmetry. There could be important consequences for:\n1) the dynamics of the explosion, 2) R-process-nucleosynthesis, and 3) some\nfuture observable neutrino pulse.\n", "  We investigate the energy transport in one-dimensional disordered granular\nsolids by extensive numerical simulations. In particular, we consider the case\nof a polydisperse granular chain composed of spherical beads of the same\nmaterial and with radii taken from a random distribution. We start by examining\nthe linear case, in which it is known that the energy transport strongly\ndepends on the type of initial conditions. Thus, we consider two sets of\ninitial conditions: i) an initial displacement and ii) an initial momentum\nexcitation of a single bead. After establishing the regime of sufficiently\nstrong disorder, we focus our studies on the role of nonlinearity for both sets\nof initial conditions. By increasing the initial excitation amplitudes we are\nable to identify three distinct dynamical regimes with different energy\ntransport properties: a near linear, a weakly nonlinear and a highly nonlinear\nregime. Although energy spreading is found to be increasing for higher\nnonlinearities, in the weakly nonlinear regime no clear asymptotic behavior of\nthe spreading is found. In this regime, we additionally find that energy,\ninitially trapped in a localized region, can be eventually detrapped and this\nhas a direct influence on the fluctuations of the energy spreading. We also\ndemonstrate that in the highly nonlinear regime, the differences in energy\ntransport between the two sets of initial conditions vanish. Actually, in this\nregime the energy is almost ballistically transported through shock-like\nexcitations.\n", "  We study a two Higgs doublet model extended by vectorlike leptons mixing with\none family of standard model leptons. Generated flavor violating couplings\nbetween heavy and light leptons can dramatically alter the decay patterns of\nheavier Higgs bosons. We focus on $pp \\to H \\to \\nu_4 \\nu_\\mu \\to W \\mu\n\\nu_\\mu$, where $\\nu_4$ is a new neutral lepton, and study possible effects of\nthis process on the measurements of $pp \\to WW$ and $H \\to WW$ since it leads\nto the same final states. We discuss predictions for contributions to $pp \\to\nWW$ and $H \\to WW$ and their correlations from the region of the parameter\nspace that satisfies all available constraints including precision electroweak\nobservables and from pair production of vectorlike leptons. Large\ncontributions, close to current limits, favor small $\\tan \\beta $ region of the\nparameter space. We find that, as a result of adopted cuts in experimental\nanalyses, the contribution to $pp \\to WW$ can be an order of magnitude larger\nthan the contribution to $H \\to WW$. Thus, future precise measurements of\n$pp\\to WW$ will further constrain the parameters of the model. In addition, we\nalso consider possible contributions to $pp\\to WW$ from the heavy Higgs decays\ninto a new charged lepton $e_4$ ($H\\to e_4 \\mu \\to W \\mu \\nu_\\mu$), exotic SM\nHiggs decays, and pair production of vectorlike leptons.\n", "  We present equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium studies of the Verwey\ntransition in magnetite. In the equilibrium optical conductivity, we find a\nstep-like change at the phase transition for photon energies below about 2 eV.\nThe possibility of triggering a non-equilibrium transient metallic state in\ninsulating magnetite by photo excitation was recently demonstrated by an x-ray\nstudy. Here we report a full characterization of the optical properties in the\nvisible frequency range across the non-equilibrium phase transition. Our\nanalysis of the spectral features is based on a detailed description of the\nequilibrium properties. The out-of-equilibrium optical data bear the initial\nelectronic response associated to localized photo-excitation, the occurrence of\nphase separation, and the transition to a transient metallic phase for\nexcitation density larger than a critical value. This allows us to identify the\nelectronic nature of the transient state, to unveil the phase transition\ndynamics, and to study the consequences of phase separation on the\nreflectivity, suggesting a spectroscopic feature that may be generally linked\nto out-of-equilibrium phase separation.\n", "  Alkaline-earth and ytterbium cold atomic gases make it possible to simulate\nSU(N)-symmetric fermionic systems in a very controlled fashion. Such a high\nsymmetry is expected to give rise to a variety of novel phenomena ranging from\nmolecular Luttinger liquids to (symmetry- protected) topological phases. We\nreview some of the phases that can be stabilized in a one dimensional lattice.\nThe physics of this multicomponent Fermi gas turns out to be much richer and\nmore exotic than in the standard SU(2) case. For N > 2, the phase diagram is\nquite rich already in the case of the single-band model, including a molecular\nLuttinger liquid (with dominant superfluid instability in the N-particle\nchannel) for incommensurate fillings, as well as various Mott-insulating phases\noccurring at commensurate fillings. Particular attention will be paid to the\ncases with additional orbital degree of freedom (which is accessible\nexperimentally either by taking into account two atomic states or by putting\natoms in the p-band levels). We introduce two microscopic models which are\nrelevant for these cases and discuss their symmetries and strong coupling\nlimits. More intriguing phase diagrams are then presented including, for\ninstance, symmetry protected topological phases characterized by non-trivial\nedge states.\n", "  We report on the first successful proof-of-principle experiment to manipulate\nlaser-matter interactions on the microscale using highly ordered Si microwire\narrays. The interaction of a high contrast short pulse laser with a flat target\nvia periodic Si microwires yields a substantial enhancement in both total and\ncut-off energies of the produced electron beam. The self generated electric and\nmagnetic fields behave as an electromagnetic lens that confines and guides\nelectrons between the microwires as they acquire relativistic energies via\ndirect laser acceleration (DLA).\n", "  We evaluate the third- and fourth-order baryon, charge and strangeness\nsusceptibilities near a chiral critical point using the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio\nmodel. We identify robust qualitative behaviours of the susceptibilities along\nhypothetical freeze-out lines that agree with previous model studies.\nQuantitatively, baryon number fluctuations are the largest in magnitude and\nthus offer the strongest signal when freeze-out occurs farther away from a\ncritical point. Charge and strangeness susceptibilities also diverge at a\ncritical point, but the area where the divergence dominates is smaller, meaning\nfreeze-out must occur closer to a critical point for a signal to be visible in\nthese observables. In case of strangeness, this is attributable to the\nrelatively large strange quark mass. Plotting the third- and fourth-order\nsusceptibilities against each other along the freeze-out line exhibits clearly\ntheir non-montonicity and robust features.\n", "  The latest results from atmospheric and accelerator neutrino experiments\nindicate that the normal neutrino mass ordering $m^{}_1 < m^{}_2 < m^{}_3$, a\nmaximal leptonic CP-violating phase $\\delta = 270^\\circ$ and the second octant\nof neutrino mixing angle $\\theta^{}_{23} > 45^\\circ$ are favored. In light of\nnew experimental results, we update previous phenomenological studies on\ntwo-zero textures of the Majorana neutrino mass matrix $M^{}_\\nu$, in the\nflavor basis where the charged-lepton mass matrix $M^{}_l$ is diagonal. When\nthe $1\\sigma$ ranges of neutrino mixing parameters are taken into account, only\nfour (i.e., ${\\bf A}^{}_{1, 2}$ and ${\\bf B}^{}_{2,4}$) among seven two-zero\npatterns of $M^{}_\\nu$ show the aforementioned features of neutrino mass\nspectrum, mixing angle $\\theta^{}_{23}$ and CP-violating phase $\\delta$, and\nthus are compatible with the latest neutrino oscillation data. The correlative\nrelations among neutrino masses and mixing parameters have been derived\nanalytically for these four patterns, and the allowed regions of neutrino\nmixing angles and the CP-violating phase are also given. Possible realizations\nof four viable two-zero textures via non-Abelian discrete flavor symmetries are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Characterizing structural inhomogeneity is an essential step in understanding\nthe mechanical response of amorphous materials. We introduce a threshold-free\nmeasure based on the field of vectors pointing from the center of each particle\nto the centroid of the Voronoi cell in which the particle resides. These\nvectors tend to point in toward regions of high free volume and away from\nregions of low free volume, reminiscent of sinks and sources in a vector field.\nWe compute the local divergence of these vectors, for which positive values\ncorrespond to overpacked regions and negative values identify underpacked\nregions within the material. Distributions of this divergence are nearly\nGaussian with zero mean, allowing for structural characterization using only\nthe moments of the distribution. We explore how the standard deviation and\nskewness vary with packing fraction for simulations of bidisperse systems and\nfind a kink in these moments that coincides with the jamming transition.\n", "  We present an analytical model capable of describing two-photon ionization of\natoms with attosecond pulses in the presence of intermediate and final isolated\nautoionizing states. The model is based on the finite-pulse formulation of\nsecond-order time-dependent perturbation theory. It approximates the\nintermediate and final states with Fano's theory for resonant continua, and it\ndepends on a small set of atomic parameters that can either be obtained from\nseparate \\emph{ab initio} calculations, or be extracted from few selected\nexperiments. We use the model to compute the two-photon resonant photoelectron\nspectrum of helium below the N=2 threshold for the RABITT (Reconstruction of\nAttosecond Beating by Interference of Two-photon Transitions) pump-probe\nscheme, in which an XUV attosecond pulse train is used in association to a weak\nIR probe, obtaining results in quantitative agreement with those from accurate\n\\emph{ab initio} simulations. In particular, we show that: i) Use of finite\npulses results in a homogeneous red shift of the RABITT beating frequency, as\nwell as a resonant modulation of the beating frequency in proximity of\nintermediate autoionizing states; ii) The phase of resonant two-photon\namplitudes generally experiences a continuous excursion as a function of the\nintermediate detuning, with either zero or $2\\pi$ overall variation.\n", "  Models based on Yang-Mills condensate (YMC) have been advocated in the\nliterature and claimed to be successful candidates to explain dark energy.\nSeveral instantiations of this simple idea have been considered, the most\npromising of which are reviewed here. Nevertheless, results previously attained\nheavily relied on the perturbative approach to the analysis of the effective\nYang-Mills action, which is only adequate in the asymptotically-free limit, and\nwere extended into a regime, the infrared limit, in which confinement is\nexpected. We show that if a minimum of the effective Lagrangian in $\\theta\n\\!=\\! - F_{\\, \\, \\mu \\nu}^a \\, F^{a \\mu \\nu}/2$ exists, a YMC forms that drives\nthe Universe toward an accelerated de Sitter phase. The details of the models\ndepend weakly on the specific form of the effective Yang-Mills Lagrangian.\nUsing non-perturbative techniques mutated from the functional renormalization\ngroup procedure, we finally show that the minimum in $\\theta$ of the effective\nLagrangian exists, thus YMC can actually take place. The non-perturbative model\nhas properties similar to the ones of the perturbative model. In the early\nstage of the universe, the YMC equation of state has an evolution that\nresembles the radiation component, i.e. $w_y \\rightarrow 1/3$. However, in the\nlate stage, $w_y$ naturally runs to the critical state with $w_y =-1$, and the\nuniverse transits from matter-dominated into dark energy dominated stage only\nrecently, at a redshift the value of which depends on the initial conditions\nthat are chosen while solving the dynamical system.\n", "  Employing efficient diagonalization techniques, we perform a detailed\nquantitative study of the regular and chaotic regions in phase space in the\nsimplest non-integrable atom-field system, the Dicke model. A close correlation\nbetween the classical Lyapunov exponents and the quantum Participation Ratio of\ncoherent states on the eigenenergy basis is exhibited for different points in\nthe phase space. It is also shown that the Participation Ratio scales linearly\nwith the number of atoms in chaotic regions, and with its square root in the\nregular ones.\n", "  We search for the process $B^0 \\to \\pi^- \\tau^+ \\nu_\\tau$ using the full\nBelle data set of $711\\,{\\rm fb}^{-1}$, corresponding to $772 \\times 10^6\nB\\bar{B}$ pairs, collected at the $\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with the Belle\ndetector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+ e^-$ collider. We reconstruct one\n$B$ meson in a hadronic decay and search for the $B^0 \\to \\pi^- \\tau^+\n\\nu_\\tau$ process in the remainder of the event. No significant signal is\nobserved and an upper limit of $\\mathcal{B}(B^0 \\to \\pi^- \\tau^+ \\nu_\\tau) <\n2.5 \\times 10^{-4}$ is obtained at the $90\\%$ confidence level.\n", "  In this note we investigate bound states, where scalar and vector bosons are\ntrapped by BPS vortices in the Abelian Higgs model with a critical ratio of the\ncouplings. A class of internal modes of fluctuation around cylindrically\nsymmetric BPS vortices is characterized mathematically, analysing the spectrum\nof the second-order fluctuation operator when the Higgs and vector boson masses\nare equal. A few of these bound states with low values of quantized magnetic\nflux are described fully, and their main properties are discussed.\n", "  The understanding of orbital hybridization and spin-polarization at the\norganic-ferromagnetic interface is essential in the search for efficient hybrid\nspintronic devices. Here, using first-principles calculations, we report a\nsystematic study of spin-split hybrid states of C$_{60}$ deposited on various\nferromagnetic surfaces: bcc-Cr(001), bcc-Fe(001), bcc-Co(001), fcc-Co(001) and\nhcp-Co(0001). We show that the adsorption geometry of the molecule with respect\nto the surface crystallographic orientation of the magnetic substrate as well\nas the strength of the interaction play an intricate role in the\nspin-polarization of the hybrid orbitals. We find that a large\nspin-polarization in vacuum above the buckyball can only be achieved if the\nmolecule is adsorbed upon a bcc-(001) surface by its pentagonal ring. Therefore\nbcc-Cr(001), bcc-Fe(001) and bcc-Co(001) are the optimal candidates.\nSpin-polarized scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements on single C$_{60}$\nadsorbed on Cr(001) and Co/Pt(111) also confirm that both the symmetry of the\nsubstrate and of the molecular conformation have a strong influence on the\ninduced spin polarization. Our finding may give valuable insights for further\nengineering of spin filtering devices through single molecular orbitals.\n", "  In this paper, we investigate models where a scalar field driving inflation\nis minimally coupled with gravity and it is subjected to a scalar potential. We\npresent several examples of coupling between the field and gravity, and we\nfurnish realistic models for inflation in agreement with the last Planck\nresults.\n", "  We investigate magnetic properties of strongly interacting four component\nspin-3/2 ultracold fermionic atoms in the Mott insulator limit with one\nparticle per site in an optical lattice with honeycomb symmetry. In this limit,\natomic tunneling is virtual, and only the atomic spins can exchange. We find a\ncompetition between symmetry breaking and liquid like disordered phases.\nParticularly interesting are valence bond states with bond centered\nmagnetizations, situated between the ferromagnetic and conventional valence\nbond phases. In the framework of a mean-field theory, we calculate the phase\ndiagram and identify an experimentally relevant parameter region where a\nhomogeneous SU(4) symmetric Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki-like valence bond state\nis present.\n", "  Scintillators attract wide research interest for their distinct applications\nin radiation detection. Elpasolite halides are among the most promising\nscintillators due to their high structural symmetry and good scintillation\nperformance. Better understanding of their underlying scintillation mechanism\nopens up new possibilities in scintillator development. In this work, we employ\na variety of experimental techniques to study the two mixed-anion elpasolites\nCs2NaRBr3I3 (R = La, Y). The emission of intrinsic Cs2NaRBr3I3 with a light\nyield ranging from 20,000 to 40,000 ph/MeV is dominant by self-trapped exciton\nemission. Partial substitution of R with Ce introduces a competing emission,\nthe Ce3+ 5d to 4f radiative transition. Ab initio calculations were performed\nto investigate the electronic structures as well as the binding energies of\npolarons in Cs2NaRBr6. The calculated large self-trapped exciton binding\nenergies are consistent with the observed high light yield due to self-trapped\nexciton emission. The unique electronic structure of halide elpasolites as\ncalculated enhances the STE stability and the STE emission. The highly tunable\nscintillation properties of mixed-anion elpasolites underscore the role of\ntheir complex scintillation mechanism. Our study provides guidance for the\ndesign of new elpasolites scintillators with exceptional energy resolution and\nlight yield desirable for applications.\n", "  We compute fragmentation corrections to hadroproduction of the quarkonium\nstates $J/\\psi$, $\\chi_{cJ}$, and $\\psi(2S)$ at leading power in $m_c^2/p_T^2$,\nwhere $m_c$ is the charm-quark mass and $p_T$ is the quarkonium transverse\nmomentum. The computation is carried out in the framework of nonrelativistic\nQCD. We include corrections to the parton-production cross sections through\nnext-to-leading order in the strong coupling $\\alpha_s$ and corrections to the\nfragmentation functions through second order in $\\alpha_s$. We also sum leading\nlogarithms of $p_T^2/m_c^2$ to all orders in perturbation theory. We find that,\nwhen we combine these leading-power fragmentation corrections with fixed-order\ncalculations through next-to-leading order in $\\alpha_s$, we are able to obtain\ngood fits for $p_T\\geq 10$ GeV to hadroproduction cross sections that were\nmeasured at the Tevatron and the LHC. Using values for the nonperturbative\nlong-distance matrix elements that we extract from the cross-section fits, we\nmake predictions for the polarizations of the quarkonium states. We obtain good\nagreement with measurements of the polarizations, with the exception of the CDF\nRun II measurement of the prompt $J/\\psi$ polarization, for which the agreement\nis only fair. In the predictions for the prompt-$J/\\psi$ cross sections and\npolarizations, we take into account feeddown from the $\\chi_{cJ}$ and\n$\\psi(2S)$ states.\n", "  An Anderson model for a magnetic impurity in a two-dimensional electron gas\nwith bulk Rashba spin-orbit interaction is solved using the numerical\nrenormalization group under two different experimental scenarios. For a fixed\nFermi energy, the Kondo temperature T_K varies weakly with Rashba coupling\n\\alpha, as reported previously. If instead the band filling is low and held\nconstant, increasing \\alpha can drive the system into a helical regime with\nexponential enhancement of T_K. Under either scenario, thermodynamic properties\nat low temperatures T exhibit the same dependences on T/T_K as are found for\n\\alpha = 0. Unlike the conventional Kondo effect, however, the impurity\nexhibits static spin correlations with conduction electrons of nonzero orbital\nangular momentum about the impurity site. We also consider a magnetic field\nthat Zeeman splits the conduction band but not the impurity level, an effective\npicture that arises under a proposed route to access the helical regime in a\ndriven system. The impurity contribution to the system's ground-state angular\nmomentum is found to be a universal function of the ratio of the Zeeman energy\nto a temperature scale that is not T_K (as would be the case in a magnetic\nfield that couples directly to the impurity spin), but rather is proportional\nto T_K divided by the impurity hybridization width. This universal scaling is\nexplained via a perturbative treatment of field-induced changes in the\nelectronic density of states.\n", "  We analyze the mathematical structure of equations for temperature Tc of the\nsuperconductivity transition in a gas of interacting Fermi particles or at the\nphonon-mediated pairing in a metal in case of non-adiabatic conditions, i. e.,\nwhen the characteristic phonon frequency is comparable or larger than the Fermi\nenergy . The integral equations for Tc are derived in the logarithmical\napproximation. The equations contain no divergent terms in the anti-adiabatic\nlimit.\n", "  Quantum correlations arising in Bell experiments, involving a physical source\nthat emits a quantum state to a number of observers, have been intensively\nstudied over the last decades. Much less is known about the nature of quantum\ncorrelations arising in network structures beyond the Bell experiments. Such\nnetworks can involve many independent sources emitting states to observers in\naccordance with the network configuration. Here, we will study classical and\nquantum correlations in a family of networks which can be regarded as\ncompositions of several independent multipartite Bell experiments connected\ntogether through a central node. For such networks we present tight Bell-type\ninequalities which are satisfied by all classical correlations. We study\nproperties of the violations of our inequalities by probability distributions\narising in quantum theory.\n", "  At interfaces between insulating oxides LaAlO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$, a two\ndimensional electron gas (2DEG) has been observed and well studied, while the\npredicted hole gas (2DHG) has not been realized due to the strong tendency of\nholes in oxygen $2p$ orbitals to localize. Here we propose, via ab initio\ncalculations, an unexplored class of materials for the realization of parallel\ntwo dimensional (2D), two carrier (electron+hole) gases: nitride-oxide\nheterostructures, with (111)-oriented ScN and MgO as the specific example.\nBeyond a critical thickness of five ScN layers, this interface hosts spatially\nseparated conducting Sc-$3d$ electrons and N-$2p$ holes, each confined to\n$\\sim$two atomic layers -- the transition metal nitride provides both gases. A\nguiding concept is that the N$^{3-}$ anion should promote robust two carrier 2D\nhole conduction compared to that of O$^{2-}$; metal mononitrides are mostly\nmetallic and even superconducting while most metal monoxides are insulating. A\nsecond positive factor is that the density of transition metal ions, hence of a\nresulting 2DG, is about three times larger for a rocksalt (111) interface than\nfor a perovskite(001) interface. Our results, including calculation of Hall\ncoefficient and thermopower for each conducting layer separately, provide\nguidance for new exploration, both experimental and theoretical, on\nnitride-based conducting gases that should promote study of long sought exotic\nstates viz. new excitonic phases and distinct, nanoscale parallel\nsuperconducting nanolayers.\n", "  We explore the stopping effect that results from interactions between dark\nmatter and nuclei as the dark matter particles travel undergound towards the\ndetector. Although this effect is negligible for heavy dark matter particles,\nthere is parameter phase space where the underground interactions of the dark\nmatter particles with the nuclei can create observable differences in the\nspectrum. Dark matter particles that arrive on the detector from below can have\nless energy from the ones arriving from above. These differences can be\npotentially detectable by upcoming directional detectors. This can unveil a\nlarge amount of information regarding the type and strength of interactions\nbetween nuclei and light dark matter candidates.\n", "  In crystals, energy band extrema in momentum space can be identified by their\nvalley index. The internal quantum degree of freedom associated with valley\npseudospin indices can act as a useful information carrier analogous to\nelectronic charge or spin. Interest in valleytronics has been revived in recent\nyears following the discovery of atomically thin materials such as graphene and\ntransition metal dichalcogenides. However, the valley coherence time, a key\nquantity for manipulating the valley pseudospin, has never been measured in any\nmaterial. In this work, we use a sequence of laser pulses to resonantly\ngenerate a coherent superposition of excitons (Coulomb-bound electron-hole\npairs) in opposite valleys of monolayer WSe$_2$. The imposed valley coherence\npersists for approximately one hundred femtoseconds. We propose that the\nelectron-hole exchange interaction provides an important decoherence mechanism\nin addition to exciton population decay. Our work provides critical insight\ninto the requirements and strategies for optical manipulation of the valley\npseudospin for future valleytronics applications.\n", "  The prospects are explored for testing Lorentz and CPT symmetry in the\ntop-quark sector. We present the relevant Lagrange density, discuss physical\nobservables, and describe the signals to be sought in experiments. For\ntop-antitop pair production via quark or gluon fusion with subsequent\nsemileptonic or hadronic decays, we obtain the matrix element in the presence\nof Lorentz violation using the narrow-width approximation. The issue of testing\nCPT symmetry in the top-quark sector is also addressed. We demonstrate that\nsingle-top production and decay is well suited to a search for CPT violation,\nand we present the matrix elements for single-top production in each of the\nfour tree-level channels. Our results are applicable to searches for Lorentz\nviolation and studies of CPT symmetry in collider experiments, including\nnotably high-statistics top-antitop and single-top production at the Large\nHadron Collider.\n", "  We consider D1-brane as a natural probe of the group manifold with mixed\nthree form fluxes. We determine Lax connection for given theory. Then we switch\nto the canonical analysis and calculate the Poisson brackets between spatial\ncomponents of Lax connections and we argue for integrability of given theory.\n", "  This work investigates the impact of the extragalactic background light\nfluctuations on very high energy $\\gamma$-ray spectra from distant Quasars. We\ncalculate the extragalactic background light spectral energy distribution using\na model that extends those proposed by Razzaque et al. (2009ApJ.697.483R) and\nFinke et al. (2010ApJ.712.238F). We introduce a model for fluctuations in the\nextragalactic background light based on fluctuations in the star formation rate\ndensity, since these two fluctuations can reasonably be expected to be\ncorrelated. Fluctuations in the star formation rate are estimated from the\nsemi-analytical galaxy catalogue of Guo et al. (2013MNRAS.428.1351G), we use\nhis model to derive the resulting opacities for $\\gamma$-rays from distant\nsources. We determine the mean, lower and upper limits for the scatter of the\nstar formation rate density, which then allow us to compute corresponding\nlimits on the extragalactic background light spectrum. We then calculate the\nimpact of these fluctuations limits on the $\\gamma$-ray optical depth. The\nmodel predicts variations of up to $10\\%$ between upper and lower limits for\nthe $\\gamma$-ray opacity in the energy range less than $100$ GeV for nearby\nsources. The impact is found to be smaller but still significant ($\\lesssim\n5\\%$) for very high energy $\\gamma$-rays from distant sources.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate a tunable hybrid qubit in a five-electron GaAs\ndouble quantum dot. The qubit is encoded in the (1,4) charge regime of the\ndouble dot and can be manipulated completely electrically. More importantly,\ndot anharmonicity leads to quasiparallel energy levels and a new anticrossing,\nwhich help preserve quantum coherence of the qubit and yield a useful working\npoint. We have performed Larmor precession and Ramsey fringe experiments near\nthe new working point and find that the qubit decoherence time is significantly\nimproved over a charge qubit. This work shows a new way to encode a\nsemiconductor qubit that is controllable and coherent.\n", "  In the Hong--Ou--Mandel interferometric scheme, two identical photons that\nilluminate a balanced beam splitter always leave through the same exit port.\nSimilar effects have been predicted and (partially) experimentally confirmed\nfor multi-photon Fock-number states. In the limit of large photon numbers, the\noutput distribution follows a $(1-x^2)^{-1/2}$ law, where $x$ is the normalized\nimbalance in the output photon numbers at the two output ports. We derive an\nanalytical formula that is also valid for imbalanced input photon numbers with\na large total number of photons, and focus on the extent to which the\nhypothesis of perfect balanced input can be relaxed, discussing the robustness\nand universal features of the output distribution.\n", "  We explore the influence of a block of excitable units on the existence and\nbehavior of chimera states in a nonlocally coupled ring-network of\nFitzHugh-Nagumo elements. The FitzHugh-Nagumo system, a paradigmatic model in\nmany fields from neuroscience to chemical pattern formation and nonlinear\nelectronics, exhibits oscillatory or excitable behavior depending on the values\nof its parameters. Until now, chimera states have been studied in networks of\ncoupled oscillatory FitzHugh-Nagumo elements. In the present work, we find that\nintroducing a block of excitable units into the network may lead to several\ninteresting effects. It allows for controlling the position of a chimera state\nas well as for generating a chimera state directly from the synchronous state.\n", "  We propose an exact formula for the energy radiated by an accelerating quark\nin N=2 superconformal theories in four dimensions. This formula reproduces the\nknown Bremsstrahlung function for N=4 theories and provides a prediction for\nall the perturbative and instanton corrections in N=2 theories. We perform a\nperturbative check of our proposal up to three loops.\n", "  We develop the tools necessary to assess the statistical significance of\nresonant features in the CMB correlation functions, combining power spectrum\nand bispectrum measurements. This significance is typically addressed by\nrunning a large number of simulations to derive the probability density\nfunction (PDF) of the feature-amplitude in the Gaussian case. Although these\nsimulations are tractable for the power spectrum, for the bispectrum they\nrequire significant computational resources. We show that, by assuming that the\nPDF is given by a multi-variate Gaussian where the covariance is determined by\nthe Fisher matrix of the sine and cosine terms, we can efficiently produce\nspectra that are statistically close to those derived from full simulations. By\ndrawing a large number of spectra from this PDF, both for the power spectrum\nand the bispectrum, we can quickly determine the statistical significance of\ncandidate signatures in the CMB, considering both single frequency and\nmulti-frequency estimators. We show that for resonance models, cosmology and\nforeground parameters have little influence on the estimated amplitude, which\nallows to simplify the analysis considerably. A more precise likelihood\ntreatment can then be applied to candidate signatures only. We also discuss a\nmodal expansion approach for the power spectrum, aimed at quickly scanning\nthrough large families of oscillating models.\n", "  We study how the coupling with gravity of theories with non-linearly realized\nspace-time symmetries is modified when one changes the parametrization of the\ncoset. As an example, we focus on the so-called Galileon duality: a\nreparametrization which maps a Galilean invariant action into another one which\nenjoys the same symmetry. Starting with a standard coupling with gravity, with\na parametric separation between the Planck scale and the typical scale of the\ncoset, one ends up with a theory without such a separation. In particular an\ninfinite set of higher-dimension operators are relevant when the\nsuperluminality of the Galileon is measurable in the effective theory. This\naddresses an apparent paradox since superluminality arises in the dual theory\neven when absent in the original one.\n", "  A one-component dark energy fluid model of the late universe is considered\n($w<-1$) when the fluid, initially assumed laminar, makes a transition into a\nturbulent state of motion. Spatial isotropy is assumed so that only the bulk\nviscosities are included ($\\zeta$ in the laminar epoch and $\\zeta_{\\rm turb}$\nin the turbulent epoch). Both viscosities are assumed to be constants. We\nderive a formula, new as far as we know, for the time dependence of the\ntemperature $T(t)$ in the laminar case when viscosity is included. Assuming\nthat the laminar/turbulent transition takes place at some time $t_s$ before the\nbig rip is reached, we then analyze the positive temperature jump experienced\nby the fluid at $t=t_*$ if $\\zeta_{\\rm turb} > \\zeta$. This is just as one\nwould expect physically. The corresponding entropy production is also\nconsidered. A special point emphasized in the paper is the analogy that exists\nbetween the cosmic fluid and a so-called Maxwell fluid in viscoelasticity.\n", "  Deformability is a central feature of many types of microswimmers, e.g. for\nartificially generated self-propelled droplets. Here, we analyze deformable\nbead-spring microswimmers in an externally imposed solvent flow field as simple\ntheoretical model systems. We focus on their behavior in a circular swirl flow\nin two spatial dimensions. Linear (straight) two-bead swimmers are found to\ncircle around the swirl with a slight drift to the outside with increasing\nactivity. In contrast to that, we observe for triangular three-bead or\nsquare-like four-bead swimmers a tendency of being drawn into the swirl and\nfinally getting drowned, although a radial inward component is absent in the\nflow field. During one cycle around the swirl, the self-propulsion direction of\nan active triangular or square-like swimmer remains almost constant, while\ntheir orbits become deformed exhibiting an ``egg-like'' shape. Over time, the\nswirl flow induces slight net rotations of these swimmer types, which leads to\nnet rotations of the egg-shaped orbits. Interestingly, in certain cases, the\norbital rotation changes sense when the swimmer approaches the flow\nsingularity. Our predictions can be verified in real-space experiments on\nartificial microswimmers.\n", "  We show how quantum fields can be used to measure the curvature of spacetime.\nIn particular, we find that knowledge of the imprint that spacetime curvature\nleaves in the correlators of quantum fields suffices, in principle, to\nreconstruct the metric. We then consider the possibility that the quantum\nfields obey a natural ultraviolet cutoff, for example, at the Planck scale. We\ninvestigate how such a cutoff limits the spatial resolution with which\ncurvature can be deduced from the properties of quantum fields. We find that\nthe metric deduced from the quantum correlator exhibits a peculiar scaling\nbehavior as the scale of the natural UV cutoff is approached.\n", "  Existing proximity effects stem from systems with a local order parameter,\nsuch as a local magnetic moment or a local superconducting pairing amplitude.\nHere, we demonstrate that despite lacking a local order parameter, topological\nphases also may give rise to a proximity effect of a distinctively inverted\nnature. We focus on a general construction in which a topological phase is\nextensively coupled to a second system, and we argue that in many cases, the\ninverse topological order will be induced on the second system. To support our\narguments, we rigorously establish this \"bulk topological proximity effect\" for\nall gapped free fermion topological phases and representative integrable models\nof interacting topological phases. We present a terrace construction which\nillustrates the phenomenological consequences of this proximity effect.\nFinally, we discuss generalizations beyond our framework, including how\nintrinsic topological order may also exhibit this effect.\n", "  We apply general relativity to construct the post-Newtonian background\nmanifold that serves as a reference spacetime in relativistic geodesy for\nconducting relativistic calculation of the geoid's undulation and the\ndeflection of the plumb line from the vertical. We chose an axisymmetric\nellipsoidal body made up of perfect homogeneous fluid uniformly rotating around\na fixed axis, as a source generating the reference geometry. We, then,\nreformulate and extend hydrodynamic calculations of rotating fluids done by\nprevious researchers to the realm of relativistic geodesy to set up algebraic\nequations defining the shape of the post-Newtonian reference ellipsoid. To\ncomplete this task, we explicitly perform all integrals characterizing\ngravitational field inside the fluid body and represent them in terms of the\nelementary functions depending on its eccentricity. We fully explore the\ncoordinate freedom of the equations describing the post-Newtonian ellipsoid and\ndemonstrate that the fractional deviation of the post-Newtonian level surface\nfrom the Maclaurin ellipsoid can be made much smaller than the previously\nanticipated estimate based on the coordinate gauge advocated by Bardeen and\nChandrasekhar. We also derive the gauge-invariant relations of the\npost-Newtonian mass and the angular velocity of the rotating fluid with the\nparameters characterizing the shape of the post-Newtonian ellipsoid. We\nformulate the post-Newtonian theorems of Pizzetti and Clairaut that are used in\ngeodesy to connect the geometric parameters of the reference ellipsoid to the\nphysically measurable force of gravity at the pole and equator. Finally, we\nexpand the post-Newtonian geodetic equations to the Taylor series with respect\nto the eccentricity of the ellipsoid and discuss their practical applications.\n", "  An effective scheme of synchronized laser-triggered ion acceleration and the\ncorresponding theoretical model are proposed for a slow light pulse of\nrelativistic intensity, which penetrates into a near-critical-density plasma,\nstrongly slows, and then increases its group velocity during propagation within\na target. The 3D PIC simulations confirm this concept for proton acceleration\nby a femtosecond petawatt-class laser pulse experiencing relativistic\nself-focusing, quantify the characteristics of the generated protons, and\ndemonstrate a significant increase of their energy compared with the proton\nenergy generated from optimized ultrathin solid dense foils.\n", "  Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) of molecules in a solution at room\ntemperature has potential to revolutionize nuclear magnetic resonance\nspectroscopy and imaging. The prevalent methods for achieving DNP in solutions\nare typically most effective in the regime of small interaction correlation\ntimes between the electron and nuclear spins, limiting the size of accessible\nmolecules. To solve this limitation, we design a mechanism for DNP in the\nliquid phase that is applicable for large interaction correlation times.\nImportantly, while this mechanism makes use of a resonance condition similar to\nsolid-state DNP, the polarization transfer is robust to a relatively large\ndetuning from the resonance due to molecular motion. We combine this scheme\nwith optically polarized nitrogen vacancy (NV) center spins in nanodiamonds to\ndesign a setup that employs optical pumping and is therefore not limited by\nroom temperature electron thermal polarisation. We illustrate numerically the\neffectiveness of the model in a flow cell containing nanodiamonds immobilized\nin a hydrogel, polarising flowing water molecules 4700-fold above thermal\npolarisation in a magnetic field of 0.35 T, in volumes detectable by current\nNMR scanners.\n", "  We present a determination of the magnitude of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa\nmatrix element $|V_{cb}|$ using the decay $B\\to D\\ell\\nu_\\ell$ ($\\ell=e,\\mu$)\nbased on 711 fb$^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-\\to \\Upsilon(4S)$ data recorded by the Belle\ndetector and containing $772 \\times 10^6$ $B\\bar{B}$ pairs. One $B$ meson in\nthe event is fully reconstructed in a hadronic decay mode while the other, on\nthe signal side, is partially reconstructed from a charged lepton and either a\n$D^+$ or $D^0$ meson in a total of 23 hadronic decay modes. The\nisospin-averaged branching fraction of the decay $B\\to D\\ell\\nu_\\ell$ is found\nto be $\\mathcal{B}(B^0 \\to D^- \\ell^+ \\nu_{\\ell})=(2.31\\pm\n0.03(\\mathrm{stat})\\pm 0.11(\\mathrm{syst}))\\%$. Analyzing the differential\ndecay rate as a function of the hadronic recoil with the parameterization of\nCaprini, Lelouch and Neubert and using the form-factor prediction\n$\\mathcal{G}(1)=1.0541\\pm 0.0083$ calculated by FNAL/MILC, we obtain\n$\\eta_\\mathrm{EW}|V_{cb}|=(40.12\\pm 1.34)\\times 10^{-3}$, where\n$\\eta_\\mathrm{EW}$ is the electroweak correction factor. Alternatively,\nassuming the model-independent form-factor parameterization of Boyd, Grinstein\nand Lebed and using lattice QCD data from the FNAL/MILC and HPQCD\ncollaborations, we find $\\eta_\\mathrm{EW}|V_{cb}|=(41.10 \\pm 1.14)\\times\n10^{-3}$.\n", "  A new non-ballistic analytical model for the intrinsic channel region of\nMOSFET-like single-walled carbon-nanotube field-effect transistors with ohmic\ncontacts has been developed which overcomes the limitations of existing models\nand extends their applicability toward high bias voltages needed for analog\napplications. The new model comprises an improved description of\nelectron-phonon scattering mechanism taking into account the accumulation of\nelectrons at the bottom of conduction subband due to back scattering by optical\nphonons. The model has been justified by a Boltzmann transport equation solver.\nThe simulation results are found to be in agreement with experimental data for\nhighly doped CNTFETs.\n", "  In this paper, I analyze numerically the behaviour of the solutions\ncorresponding to an Abelian string in the framework of the Starobinsky model.\nThe role played by the quadratic term in the Lagrangian density $f(R) = R +\n\\eta R^2$ of this model is emphasized and the results are compared with the\ncorresponding ones obtained in the framework of Einstein's theory of gravity. I\nhave found that the angular deficit generated by the string is lowered as the\n$\\eta$ parameter increases, allowing a well-behaved spacetime for a large range\nof values of the symmetry-breaking scale.\n", "  We present a deterministic algorithm called contact density dynamics that\ngenerates any prescribed target distribution in the physical phase space. Akin\nto the famous model of Nos\\'e-Hoover, our algorithm is based on a\nnon-Hamiltonian system in an extended phase space. However the equations of\nmotion in our case follow from contact geometry and we show that in general\nthey have a similar form to those of the so-called density dynamics algorithm.\nAs a prototypical example, we apply our algorithm to produce Gibbs canonical\ndistribution for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator.\n", "  We present the joint helicity amplitudes for $J/\\psi \\to \\Lambda\n\\bar{\\Lambda}$, $\\Lambda(\\bar\\Lambda)$ decays to different final states in the\nhelicity frame. Two observables to search for $CP$ violation in\n$J/\\psi\\to\\Lambda\\bar\\Lambda$ can be expressed with the information of helicity\nangles of baryon and antibaryon. Four decay parameters of $\\Lambda$ and\n$\\bar\\Lambda$, namely, $\\alpha_-,\\alpha_+,\\alpha_0$ and $\\bar\\alpha_0$, can be\nobtained with the joint helicity amplitude equations by the likelihood fit\nmethod. With the data sample of $10^{10}$ $J/\\psi$ decays accumulated by\nBESIII, the precision of the measurements is estimated to be about $10^{-3}$.\n", "  Recently, there has been substantial interest in realizations of skyrmions,\nin particular in 2D systems due to increased stability resulting from reduced\ndimensionality. A stable skyrmion, representing the smallest realizable\nmagnetic texture, could be an ideal element for ultra-dense magnetic memories.\nHere, we use the most general form of the 2D free energy with\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions constructed from general symmetry\nconsiderations reflecting the underlying system. We predict that skyrmion phase\nis robust and it is present even when the system lacks the in-plane rotational\nsymmetry. In fact, the lowered symmetry leads to increased stability of\nvortex-antivortex lattices with four-fold symmetry and in-plane spirals, in\nsome instances even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Our results\nrelate different hexagonal and square cell phases to the symmetries of\nmaterials used for realizations of skyrmions. This will give clear directions\nfor experimental realizations of hexagonal and square cell phases, and will\nallow engineering of skyrmions with unusual properties. We also predict\nstriking differences in gyro-dynamics induced by spin currents for isolated\nskyrmions and for crystals where spin currents can be induced by charge\ncarriers or by thermal magnons. We find that under certain conditions, isolated\nskyrmions can move along the current without a side motion which can have\nimplications for realizations of magnetic memories.\n", "  We present an implementation of photonic qubit precertification that performs\nthe delicate task of detecting the presence of a flying photon without\ndestroying its qubit state, allowing loss-sensitive quantum cryptography and\ntests of nonlocality even over long distance. By splitting an incoming single\nphoton in two via parametric down-conversion, we herald the photon's arrival\nfrom an independent photon source while preserving its quantum information with\nup to $92.3\\pm0.6$ % fidelity. With reduced detector dark counts,\nprecertification will be immediately useful in quantum communication.\n", "  The existence of surface elastic waves at a mechanically free surface of\ngranular phononic crystals is studied. The granular phononic crystals are made\nof spherical particles distributed periodically on a simple cubic lattice. It\nis assumed that the particles are interacting by means of normal, shear and\nbending contact rigidities. First, Rayleigh-type surface acoustic waves, where\nthe displacement of the particles takes place in the sagittal plane while the\nparticles possess one rotational and two translational degrees of freedom, are\nanalyzed. Second, shear-horizontal-type waves, where the displacement of the\nparticles is normal to the sagittal plane while the particles possess one\ntranslational and two rotational degrees of freedom are studied. The existence\nof zero-group velocity surface acoustic waves of Rayleigh-type is theoretically\npredicted and interpreted. A comparison with surface waves predicted by the\nCosserat theory is performed, and its limitations are established.\n", "  We investigate the groundstate behaviour of Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard lattices\nin the presence of a synthetic magnetic field, via a Gutzwiller ansatz.\nSpecifically, we study the Mott-Superfluid transition, and the formation of\nvortex lattices in the superfluid regime. We find a suppression of the\nsuperfluid fraction due to the frustration induced by the incommensurate\nmagnetic and spacial lattice lengths. We also predict the formation of regime.\n", "  A near-field thermal Hall effect (i.e.Righi-Leduc effect) in networks of\nmagneto-optical particles placed in a constant magnetic field is predicted.\nThis many-body effect is related to a symmetry breaking in the system induced\nby the magnetic field which gives rise to preferential channels for the\nheat-transport by near-field interaction thanks to the particles anisotropy\ntuning.\n", "  Phase diagrams and hysteresis loops were obtained by Monte Carlo simulations\nand a mean-field method for a simplified model of a spin-crossover material\nwith a two-step transition between the high-spin and low-spin states. This\nmodel is a mapping onto a square-lattice $S=1/2$ Ising model with\nantiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor and ferromagnetic Husimi-Temperley\n(equivalent-neighbor) long-range interactions. Phase diagrams obtained by the\ntwo methods for weak and strong long-range interactions are found to be\nsimilar. However, for intermediate-strength long-range interactions, the Monte\nCarlo simulations show that tricritical points decompose into pairs of critical\nendpoints and mean-field critical points surrounded by horn-shaped regions of\nmetastability. Hysteresis loops along paths traversing the horn regions are\nstrongly reminiscent of thermal two-step transition loops with hysteresis,\nrecently observed experimentally in several spin-crossover materials. We\nbelieve analogous phenomena should be observable in experiments and simulations\nfor many systems that exhibit competition between local antiferromagnetic-like\ninteractions and long-range ferromagnetic-like interactions caused by elastic\ndistortions.\n", "  Search for invisible final states produced at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\nby new physics scenarios are normally carried out resorting to a variety of\nprobes emerging from the initial state, in the form of single-jet, -photon and\n-$Z$ boson signatures. These are particularly effective for models of\nSupersymmetry (SUSY) in presence of $R$-parity conservation, owing to the\npresence in their spectra of a stable neutralino as dark matter candidate. We\nassume here as theoretical framework Supersymmetric ($B-L$) extension of the\nStandard Model (BLSSM), wherein a mediator for invisible decays can be $Z'$\nboson. The peculiarity of the signal is thus that the final state objects carry\na very large (transverse) missing energy, since the $Z'$ is naturally massive\nand constrained by direct searches and electro-weak precision tests to be at\nleast in TeV scale region. Under these circumstances the efficiency in\naccessing the invisible final state and rejecting the standard model background\nis very high. This somehow compensates the rather meagre production rates.\nAnother special feature of this invisible BLSSM signal is its composition,\nwhich is often dominated by sneutrino decays (alongside the more traditional\nneutrino and neutralino modes). Sensitivity of the CERN machine to these two\nfeatures can therefore help disentangling the BLSSM from more popular SUSY\nmodels. We assess in this analysis the scope of the LHC in establishing the\naforementioned invisible signals through a sophisticated signal-to-background\nsimulation carried out in presence of parton shower, hadronisation and detector\neffects. We find that significant sensitivity exists already after 300\nfb$^{-1}$ during Run 2. We find that mono-jet events can be readily accessible\nat the LHC, so as to enable one to claim a prompt discovery, while mono-photon\nand -$Z$ signals can be used as diagnostic tools of the underlying scenario.\n", "  The discontinuity, or imaginary part of a self-energy at finite temperature\nis proportional to the rate at which the corresponding particles are produced\nwhen very few of them are present, and also to the rate at which their phase\nspace density approaches the thermal one. These relations were suggested by\nWeldon [1], who demonstrated them for low orders in perturbation theory. Here\nwe show that they are valid at leading order in a linear coupling of the\nproduced particles, and to all orders in all other interactions of the hot\nplasma, if there is a separation of the time scales for the production and for\nthe thermalization of the bulk of the plasma.\n", "  The center of mass (CM) energy in a collisional Penrose process - a collision\ntaking place within the ergosphere of a Kerr black hole - can diverge under\nsuitable extreme conditions (maximal Kerr, near horizon collision and suitable\nimpact parameters). We present an analytic expression for the CM energy,\nrefining expressions given in the literature. Even though the CM energy\ndiverges, we show that the maximal energy attained by a particle that escapes\nthe black hole's gravitational pull and reaches infinity is modest. We obtain\nan analytic expression for the energy of an escaping particle resulting from a\ncollisional Penrose process, and apply it to derive the maximal energy and the\nmaximal efficiency for several physical scenarios: pair annihilation, Compton\nscattering, and the elastic scattering of two massive particles. In all\nphysically reasonable cases (in which the incident particles initially fall\nfrom infinity towards the black hole) the maximal energy (and the corresponding\nefficiency) are only one order of magnitude larger than the rest mass energy of\nthe incident particles. The maximal efficiency found is ~ 13.92 and it is\nobtained for the scattering of an outgoing massless particle by a massive\nparticle.\n", "  QMA (Quantum Merlin Arthur) is the class of problems which, though\npotentially hard to solve, have a quantum solution which can be verified\nefficiently using a quantum computer. It thus forms a natural quantum version\nof the classical complexity class NP (and its probabilistic variant MA,\nMerlin-Arthur games), where the verifier has only classical computational\nresources. In this paper, we study what happens when we restrict the quantum\nresources of the verifier to the bare minimum: individual measurements on\nsingle qubits received as they come, one-by-one. We find that despite this\ngrave restriction, it is still possible to soundly verify any problem in QMA\nfor the verifier with the minimum quantum resources possible, without using any\nquantum memory or multiqubit operations. We provide two independent proofs of\nthis fact, based on measurement based quantum computation and the local\nHamiltonian problem, respectively. The former construction also applies to\nQMA$_1$, i.e., QMA with one-sided error.\n", "  We investigate the effects of the violation of the Ginsparg-Wilson (GW)\nrelation in the M\\\"obius domain-wall fermion formulation on the lattice with\nfinite fifth dimension. Using a decomposion in terms of the eigenmodes of its\nfour-dimensional effective Dirac operator, we isolate the GW-violating terms\nfor various physical quantities including the residual mass and the meson\nsusceptibilities relevant for the effective restoration of the axial U(1)\nsymmetry at finite temperature. Numerical result shows that the GW-violating\neffect is more significant, or even overwhelming, for the quantities that are\ndominated by the low-lying eigenmodes.\n", "  We present revised basic stellar astrophysical parameters: masses,\nluminosities, ages and radii for 342 stars from PennState-Toru\\'n Centre for\nAstronomy Planet Search. Atmospheric parameters for 327 stars are available\nfrom Zieli\\'nski (2012), for the remaining 15 objects we present also\nspectroscopic atmospheric parameters: effective temperatures, surface gravities\nand iron abundances. Spectroscopic atmospheric parameters were obtained with a\nstandard spectroscopic analysis procedure, using ARES (Sousa, 2007) and MOOG\n(Sneden, 1973) or TGVIT (Takeda, 2005) codes. To refine stellar masses, ages\nand luminosities we applied a Bayesian method based on Jorgensen (2005)\nformalism, modified by da Silva (2006). The revised stellar masses for 342\nstars and their uncertainties are generally lower than those presented in\nZieli\\'nski (2012). Atmospheric parameters for 13 objects are determined here\nfor the first time.\n", "  We present a phenomenological study of triple-Higgs production in which we\nestimate the prospects for measuring the form of the Higgs potential at future\ncircular collider projects. We analyze proton-proton collisions at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 100 TeV and focus on two different signatures in which\nthe final state is made of four b-jets and either a pair of photons or a pair\nof tau leptons. We study the resulting sensitivity on the Higgs cubic and\nquartic self-interactions and investigate how it depends on the b-tagging,\ntau-tagging and photon resolution performances of detectors that could be\ndesigned for these future machines. We then discuss possible luminosity goals\nfor future 100 TeV collider projects that would allow for a measurement of the\nHiggs potential and its possible departures from the Standard Model\nexpectation.\n", "  We study the effect of anisotropy of the Rashba coupling on the extrinsic\nspin Hall effect due to spin-orbit active adatoms on graphene. In addition to\nthe intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, a generalized anisotropic Rashba coupling\narising from the breakdown of both mirror and hexagonal symmetries of pristine\ngraphene is considered. We find that Rashba anisotropy can strongly modify the\ndependence of the spin Hall angle on carrier concentration. Our model provides\na simple and general description of the skew scattering mechanism due to the\nspin-orbit coupling that is induced by proximity to large adatom clusters.\n", "  Experimental and theoretical studies on ratchet effects in graphene with a\nlateral superlattice excited by alternating electric fields of terahertz\nfrequency range are presented. A lateral superlatice deposited on top of\nmonolayer graphene is formed either by periodically repeated metal stripes\nhaving different widths and spacings or by inter-digitated comb-like\ndual-grating-gate (DGG) structures. We show that the ratchet photocurrent\nexcited by terahertz radiation and sensitive to the radiation polarization\nstate can be efficiently controlled by the back gate driving the system through\nthe Dirac point as well as by the lateral asymmetry varied by applying unequal\nvoltages to the DGG subgratings. The ratchet photocurrent includes the Seebeck\nthermoratchet effect as well as the effects of \"linear\" and \"circular\"\nratchets, sensitive to the corresponding polarization of the driving\nelectromagnetic force. The experimental data are analyzed for the electronic\nand plasmonic ratchets taking into account the calculated potential profile and\nthe near field acting on carriers in graphene. We show that the photocurrent\ngeneration is based on a combined action of a spatially periodic in-plane\npotential and the spatially modulated light due to the near field effects of\nthe light diffraction.\n", "  We present a combined experimental and theoretical study of the effects of\nRydberg interactions on Autler-Townes spectra of ultracold gases of atomic\nstrontium. Realizing two-photon Rydberg excitation via a long-lived triplet\nstate allows us to probe the thus far unexplored regime where Rydberg state\ndecay presents the dominant decoherence mechanism. The effects of Rydberg\ninteractions are observed in shifts, asymmetries, and broadening of the\nmeasured atom-loss spectra. The experiment is analyzed within a one-body\ndensity matrix approach, accounting for interaction-induced level shifts and\ndephasing through nonlinear terms that approximately incorporate correlations\ndue to the Rydberg blockade. This description yields good agreement with our\nexperimental observations for short excitation times. For longer excitation\ntimes, the loss spectrum is altered qualitatively, suggesting additional\ndephasing mechanisms beyond the standard blockade mechanism based on pure van\nder Waals interactions.\n", "  Complex morphologies and microstructures that emerge during materials growth\nand solidification are often determined by both equilibrium and kinetic\nproperties of the interface and their crystalline anisotropies. However limited\nknowledge is available for the alloying and particularly the compositionally\ngenerated elastic effects on these interface characteristics. Here we\nsystematically investigate such compositional effects on the interfacial\nproperties of an alloy model system based on the phase-field-crystal analysis,\nincluding the solid-liquid interfacial free energy, kinetic coefficient, and\nlattice pinning strength. Scaling relations for these interfacial quantities\nover various ranges of material parameters are identified and predicted. Our\nresults indicate the important effects of couplings among mesoscopic and\nmicroscopic length scales of alloy structure and concentration, and also the\ninfluence of compressive and tensile interface stresses induced by composition\nvariations. The approach developed here provides an efficient way to\nsystematically identify these key material properties beyond the traditional\natomistic and continuum methods.\n", "  We demonstrate a new technique for the experimental measurement of the\nspectral coherence of microresonator optical frequency combs. Specifically, we\nuse a spectral interference method, typically used in the context of\nsupercontinuum generation, to explore the variation of the complex degree of\nfirst order coherence across the full comb bandwidth. We measure the coherence\nof two different frequency combs, and observe wholly different coherence\ncharacteristics. In particular, we find that the observed dynamical regimes are\nsimilar to the stable and unstable modulation instability regimes reported in\nprevious theoretical studies. Results from numerical simulations are found to\nbe in good agreement with experimental observations. In addition to\ndemonstrating a new technique to assess comb stability, our results provide\nstrong experimental support for previous theoretical analyses.\n", "  We calculate the properties of excited charm and charm-strange mesons. We use\nthe relativized quark model to calculate their masses and wavefunctions that\nare used to calculate radiative transition partial widths and the $^3P_0$\nquark-pair-creation model to calculate their strong decay widths. We use these\nresults to make quark model spectroscopic assignments for recently observed\ncharm and charm-strange mesons. In particular we find that the properties of\nthe $D_J(2550)^0$ and $D_J^*(2600)^0$ are consistent with those of the\n$2^1S_0(c\\bar{u})$ and the $2^3S_1(c\\bar{u})$ states respectively, the\n$D_1^*(2760)^0$, $D_3^*(2760)^-$, and $D_J(2750)^0$ with those of the\n$1^3D_1(c\\bar{u})$, $1^3D_3(d\\bar{c})$, and $1D_2(c\\bar{u})$ states\nrespectively. We tentatively identify the $D^*_J(3000)^0$ as the\n$1^3F_4(c\\bar{u})$ and favour the $D_J(3000)^0$ to be the $3^1S_0(c\\bar{u})$\nalthough we do not rule out the $1F_3$ and $1F_3'$ assignment. For the recently\nobserved charm-strange mesons we identify the $D_{s1}^*(2709)^\\pm$,\n$D_{s1}^*(2860)^-$, and $D_{s3}^*(2860)^-$ as the $2^3S_1(c\\bar{s})$,\n$1^3D_1(s\\bar{c})$, and $1^3D_3(s\\bar{c})$ states respectively and suggest that\nthe $D_{sJ}(3044)^\\pm$ is most likely the $D_{s1}(2P_1')$ or $D_{s1}(2P_1)$\nstates although it might be the $D_{s2}^*(2^3P_2)$ with the $DK$ final state\ntoo small to be observed with current statistics. Based on the predicted\nproperties of excited states, that they not have too large a total width and\nthey have a reasonable branching ratio to simple final states, we suggest\nstates that should be able to be found in the near future. We expect that the\ntables of properties summarizing our results will be useful for interpreting\nfuture observations of charm and charm-strange mesons.\n", "  The electronic structure of the transparent semiconductor In2O3 has been\nstudied by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy upon deposition of\nmetallic indium and also tin on the surface of the semiconductor. By deposition\nof metallic indium on In2O3 (111) single crystals, we detected the formation of\na free-electron like band of effective mass (0.38+-0.05) m0. At low coverages,\nmetallic In shifts the Fermi level of In2O3 to higher energies and a new\nelectronic state forms at the metal/semiconductor interface. This state of\ntwo-dimensional character (2D-electron gas) is completely responsible for the\nelectrical conduction in In2O3 (111) at the surface region and has a band\ndispersion, which does not correspond to the previously found surface\naccumulation layers in this material. Despite the similarity of the electronic\nproperties of In and Sn, a larger downward banding was observed by Sn coverage,\nwhich was not accompanied by the appearance of the surface state.\n", "  We examine the phase diagram of the spin-$1$ $J_1-J_2-J_3$ ferromagnetic\nHeisenberg model with an easy-plane crystal field on the cubic lattice, in\nwhich $J_1$ is the ferromagnetic exchange interaction between nearest\nneighbors, $J_2$ is the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between\nnext-nearest neighbors and $J_3$ is the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction\nbetween next-next-nearest neighbors. Using the bond-operator formalism, we\ninvestigate the phase transitions between the disordered paramagnetic phase and\nthe ordered ones.\n  We show that the nature of the quantum phase transitions change as the\nfrustration parameters ($\\frac{J_2}{J_1}$, $\\frac{J_3}{J_1}$) are varied. The\nzero-temperature phase diagram exhibits second- and first-order transitions,\ndepending on the energy gap behavior. Remarkably, we find a disordered\nnonmagnetic phase, even in the absence of a crystal field, which is suggested\nto be a quantum spin liquid candidate. We also depict the phase diagram at\nfinite temperature for some values of crystal field and frustration parameters.\n", "  We demonstrate numerically a method of focusing two-photon field inside\none-dimensional random media. The approach is based on coherent control of\nbackscattering achieved by adaptive spectral pulse shaping. The spectral phases\nof a femtosecond laser pulse are adjusted for the constructive interference of\nits backward-traveling components, resulting in an enhanced reflection from\nwithin the random system. A delayed forward-propagating second pulse overlaps\nwith the controlled reflection, increasing the inter-pulse multi-photon field\nat a location determined by the delay between the two pulses. The technique is\nshown to be robust against the variations of the disorder, and to work with\nrealistic pulse shaping parameters, hence enabling applications in controlling\nrandom lasing and multi-photon imaging in scattering materials.\n", "  We consider a one-dimensional system with particles having either positive or\nnegative velocity, which annihilate on contact. To the ballistic motion of the\nparticle, a diffusion is superimposed. The annihilation may represent a\nreaction in which the two particles yield an inert species. This model has been\nthe object of previous work, in which it was shown that the particle\nconcentration decays faster than either the purely ballistic or the purely\ndiffusive case. We report on previously unnoticed behaviour for large times,\nwhen only one of the two species remains and also unravel the underlying\nfractal structure present in the system. We also consider in detail the case in\nwhich the initial concentration of right-going particles is $1/2+\\varepsilon$,\nwith $\\varepsilon\\neq0$. It is shown that a remarkably rich behaviour arises,\nin which two crossover times are observed as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$.\n", "  We establish a correspondence between general relativity with diffeomorphism\ninvariance and scalar field theories with Galilean invariance: notions such as\nthe Levi-Civita connection and the Riemann tensor have a Galilean counterpart.\nThis suggests Galilean theories as the unique nontrivial alternative to gauge\ntheories (including general relativity). Moreover, it is shown that the\nrequirement of first-order Palatini formalism uniquely determines the Galileon\nmodels with second-order field equations, similar to the Lovelock gravity\ntheories. Possible extensions are discussed.\n", "  A poloidal tilting symmetry of the local nonlinear $\\delta f$ gyrokinetic\nmodel is demonstrated analytically and verified numerically. This symmetry\nshows that poloidally rotating all the flux surface shaping effects with large\npoloidal mode number by a single tilt angle has an exponentially small effect\non the transport properties of a tokamak. This is shown using a generalization\nof the Miller local equilibrium model to specify an arbitrary flux surface\ngeometry. With this geometry specification we find that, when performing an\nexpansion in large flux surface shaping mode number, the governing equations of\ngyrokinetics are symmetric in the poloidal tilt of the high order shaping\neffects. This allows us to take the fluxes from a single configuration and\ncalculate the fluxes in any configuration that can be produced by tilting the\nlarge mode number shaping effects. This creates a distinction between tokamaks\nwith mirror symmetric flux surfaces and tokamaks without mirror symmetry, which\nis expected to have important consequences for generating toroidal rotation\nusing up-down asymmetry.\n", "  The center-of-mass energy of two particles can become arbitrarily large if\nthey collide near the event horizon of an extremal Kerr black hole, which is\ncalled the Ba$\\rm \\tilde n$ados-Silk-West (BSW) effect. We consider such a\nhigh-energy collision of two particles which started from infinity and follow\ngeodesics in the equatorial plane and investigate the energy extraction from\nsuch a high-energy particle collision and the production of particles in the\nequatorial plane. We analytically show that, on the one hand, if the produced\nparticles are as massive as the colliding particles, the energy-extraction\nefficiency is bounded by $2.19$ approximately. On the other hand, if a very\nmassive particle is to be produced as a result of the high-energy collision,\nwhich has negative energy and necessarily falls into the black hole, the upper\nlimit of the energy-extraction efficiency is increased to $(2+\\sqrt{3})^2\n\\simeq 13.9$. Thus, higher efficiency of the energy extraction, which is\ntypically as large as 10, provides strong evidence for the production of a\nheavy particle.\n", "  We present ab initio GW plus cumulant-expansion calculations for an organic\ncompound (TMTSF)2PF6 and a transition-metal oxide SrVO3. These materials\nexhibit characteristic low-energy band structures around the Fermi level, which\nbring about interesting low-energy properties; the low-energy bands near the\nFermi level are isolated from the other bands and, in the isolated bands,\nunusually low-energy plasmon excitations occur. To study the effect of this\nlow-energy-plasmon fluctuation on the electronic structure, we calculate\nspectral functions and photoemission spectra using the ab initio cumulant\nexpansion of the Green's function based on the GW self-energy. We found that\nthe low-energy plasmon fluctuation leads to an appreciable renormalization of\nthe low-energy bands and a transfer of the spectral weight into the incoherent\npart, thus resulting in an agreement with experimental photoemission data.\n", "  We study corner contributions to holographic mutual information for\nentangling regions composed of a set of disjoint sectors of a single infinite\ncircle in three-dimensional conformal field theories. In spite of the UV\ndivergence of holographic mutual information, it exhibits a first order phase\ntransition. We show that tripartite information is also divergent for disjoint\nsectors, which is in contrast with the well-known feature of tripartite\ninformation being finite even when entangling regions share boundaries. We also\nverify the locality of corner effects by studying mutual information between\nregions separated by a sharp annular region. Possible extensions to higher\ndimensions and hyperscaling violating geometries is also considered for\ndisjoint sectors.\n", "  We consider the application of group invariant transformations in order to\nconstrain a flat isotropic and homogeneous cosmological model, containing of a\nBrans-Dicke scalar field and a perfect fluid with a constant equation of state\nparameter $w$, where the latter is not interacting with the scalar field in the\ngravitational action integral. The requirement that the Wheeler-DeWitt equation\nbe invariant under one-parameter point transformations provides us with two\nfamilies of power-law potentials for the Brans-Dicke field, in which the powers\nare functions of the Brans-Dicke parameter $\\omega_{BD}$ and the parameter $w$.\nThe existence of the Lie symmetry in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation is equivalent\nto the existence of a conserved quantity in field equations and with\noscillatory terms in the wavefunction of the universe. This enables us to solve\nthe field equations. For a specific value of the conserved quantity, we find a\nclosed-form solution for the Hubble factor, which is equivalent to a\ncosmological model in general relativity containing two perfect fluids. This\nprovides us with different models for specific values of the parameters\n$\\omega_{BD},$ and $w$. Finally, the results hold for the specific case where\nthe Brans-Dicke parameter $\\omega_{BD}$ is zero, that is, for the O'Hanlon\nmassive dilaton theory, and consequently for $f\\left( R\\right) $ gravity in the\nmetric formalism.\n", "  The electronic structure of monolayer MoS$_2$ nanoribbons and quantum dots\nhave been investigated by means of an effective $\\mathbf{k}\\cdot \\mathbf{p}$\ntwo-band model. Both systems with borders exhibit states spatially localized on\nthe edges and with energies lying in the band gap. We show that the conduction\nand valence band curvatures determine the presence/absence of these states\nwhose origin has been related to the marginal topological properties of the\nMoS$_2$ single-valley Hamiltonian.\n", "  We test the ability of a general low-dimensional model for turbulence to\npredict geometry-dependent dynamics of large-scale coherent structures, such as\nconvection rolls. The model consists of stochastic ordinary differential\nequations, which are derived as a function of boundary geometry from the\nNavier-Stokes equations (Brown and Ahlers 2008). We test the model using\nRayleigh-B\\'enard convection experiments in a cubic container. The model\npredicts a new mode in which the alignment of a convection roll switches\nbetween diagonals. We observe this mode with a measured switching rate within\n30% of the prediction.\n", "  We study particle-hole instabilities in the framework of the spin-fermion\n(SF) model. In contrast to previous studies, we assume that adjacent hot spots\ncan overlap due to a shallow dispersion of the electron spectrum in the\nantinodal region. In addition, we take into account effects of a remnant low\nenergy and momentum Coulomb interaction. We demonstrate that at sufficiently\nsmall values $|\\varepsilon (\\pi ,0)-E_{F}|\\lesssim \\Gamma $, where $E_{F}$ is\nthe Fermi energy, $\\varepsilon \\left( \\pi ,0\\right) $ is the energy in the\nmiddle of the Brillouin zone edge, and $\\Gamma $ is a characteristic energy of\nthe fermion-fermion interaction due to the antiferromagnetic fluctuations, the\nleading particle-hole instability is a d-form factor Fermi surface deformation\n(Pomeranchuk instability) rather than the charge modulation along the Brillouin\nzone diagonals predicted within the standard SF model previously. At lower\ntemperatures, we find that the deformed Fermi surface is further unstable to\nformation of a d-form factor charge density wave (CDW) with a wave vector along\nthe Cu-O-Cu bonds (axes of the Brillouin zone). We show that the remnant\nCoulomb interaction enhances the d-form factor symmetry of the CDW. These\nfindings can explain the robustness of this order in the cuprates. The\napproximations made in the paper are justified by a small parameter that allows\none an Eliashberg-like treatment. Comparison with experiments suggests that in\nmany cuprate compounds the prerequisites for the proposed scenario are indeed\nfulfilled and the results obtained may explain important features of the charge\nmodulations observed recently.\n", "  We present an overview of the results obtained in pPb and PbPb collisions at\nthe Large Hadron Collider during Run 1. We first discuss the results for global\ncharacteristics: cross sections, hadron multiplicities, azimuthal asymmetries,\ncorrelations at low transverse momentum, hadrochemistry, and femtoscopy. We\nthen review hard and electromagnetic probes: particles with high transverse\nmomentum, jets, heavy quarks, quarkonium, electroweak bosons and high\ntransverse momentum photons, low transverse momentum photons and dileptons, and\nultraperipheral collisions. We mainly focus on the experimental results, and\npresent very briefly the main current theoretical explanations.\n", "  We use gauge-invariant cosmological perturbation theory to calculate the\ndisplacement field that sets the initial conditions for $N$-body simulations.\nUsing first and second-order fully relativistic perturbation theory in the\nsynchronous-comoving gauge, allows us to go beyond the Newtonian predictions\nand to calculate relativistic corrections to it. We use an Einstein--de Sitter\nmodel, including both growing and decaying modes in our solutions. The impact\nof our results should be assessed through the implementation of the featured\ndisplacement in cosmological $N$-body simulations.\n", "  We address the topological nature of electronic states of step edges of\nBi(111) films by first principles band structure calculations. We confirm that\nthe dispersion of step edge states reflects the topological nature of\nunderlying films. This result unambiguously denies recent claims that the step\nedge state on the surface of a bulk Bi(111) crystal or a sufficiently thick\nBi(111) films represents non-trivial edge states of the two dimensional\ntopologcial insulator phase expected for a very thin Bi(111) film. The trivial\nstep edge states have a gigantic spin splitting of one dimensional Rashba bands\nand the substantial intermixing with electronic states of the bulk, which might\nbe exploited further.\n", "  We report evidence for the simultaneous production of $J/\\psi$ and $\\Upsilon$\nmesons in 8.1 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected at $\\sqrt{s}=$1.96 TeV by the D0\nexperiment at the Fermilab $p \\bar p$ Tevatron Collider. Events with these\ncharacteristics are expected to be produced predominantly by gluon-gluon\ninteractions. In this analysis, we extract the effective cross section\ncharacterizing the initial parton spatial distribution, $\\sigma_{eff}=2.2\\pm\n0.7\\mbox{(stat)} \\pm 0.9 \\mbox{(syst)} ~\\mbox{mb}$.\n", "  Utilizing a recently found class of exact, analytic rotating solutions of\nnon-relativistic fireball hydrodynamics, we calculate analytically the\nsingle-particle spectra, the elliptic flows and two-particle Bose-Einstein\ncorrelation functions for rotating and expanding fireballs with spheroidal\nsymmetry. We demonstrate, that rotation generates final state momentum\nanisotropies even for a spatially symmetric, spherical initial geometry of the\nfireball. The mass dependence of the effective temperatures, as well as the HBT\nradius parameters and the elliptic flow are shown to be sensitive not only to\nradial flow effects but also to the magnitude of the initial angular momentum.\n", "  Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is expected to partly determine the topologically\nnontrivial electronic structure of heavy half-Heusler ternary compounds.\nHowever, to date, attempts to experimentally observe either the strength of SOC\nor how it modifies the bulk band structure have been unsuccessful. By using\nbulk-sensitive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy combined with\nfirst-principles calculations, we reveal that 209Bi NMR isotropic shifts scale\nwith relativity in terms of the strength of SOC and average atomic numbers,\nindicating strong relativistic effects on NMR parameters. According to\nfirst-principles calculations, we further claim that nuclear magnetic\nshieldings from relativistic p1/2 states and paramagnetic contributions from\nlow-lying unoccupied p3/2 states are both sensitive to the details of band\nstructures tuned by relativity, which explains why the hidden relativistic\neffects on band structure can be revealed by 209Bi NMR isotropic shifts in\ntopologically nontrivial half-Heusler compounds. Used in complement to\nsurface-sensitive methods, such as angle resolved photon electron spectroscopy\nand scanning tunneling spectroscopy, NMR can provide valuable information on\nbulk electronic states.\n", "  In this paper, we consider a charged massive fermionic quantum field in the\nspace-time of an idealized cosmic string, in the presence of a magnetic field\nconfined in a cylindrical tube of finite radius. Three distinct configurations\nfor the magnetic field is taken into account: (i) a cylindrical shell of radius\n$a$, (ii) a magnetic field proportional to $1/r$ and (iii) a constant magnetic\nfield. In these three cases, the axis of the infinitely long tube of radius $a$\ncoincides with the cosmic string. Our main objective is to analyze the induced\nvacuum fermionic current densities outside the tube. In order to do that, we\nexplicitly construct the wave-functions inside and outside the tube for each\ncase. Having the complete set of normalized wave-functions, we use the\nsummation method to develop our analysis. We show that in the region outside\nthe tube, the induced currents are decomposed into a parts corresponding to a\nzero-thickness magnetic flux in addition to a core-induced contributions. The\nlatter presents specific form depending on the magnetic field configuration\nconsidered. We also see that the only non-vanishing component of fermionic\ncurrent corresponds to the azimuthal one. The zero-thickness contribution\ndepends only on the fractional part of the ration of the magnetic flux inside\nthe tube by the quantum one. As to the core-induced contribution, it depends on\nthe total magnetic flux inside the tube, and consequently, in general, it is\nnot a periodic function of the flux.\n", "  We consider observational effects of a running effective Planck mass in the\nscalar-tensor gravity theory. At the background level, an increasing effective\nPlanck mass allows a larger Hubble constant $H_0$, which is more compatible\nwith the local direct measurements. At the perturbative level, for cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) anisotropies, an increasing effective Planck mass\n($i$) suppresses the unlensed CMB power at $\\ell \\lesssim 30$ via the\nintegrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and ($ii$) enhances CMB lensing power. Both\neffects slightly relax the tension between the current CMB data from the Planck\nsatellite and the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model predictions. However, those\nimpacts on the CMB secondary anisotropies are subdominant, and the overall\nconstraints are driven by the background measurements. Combining CMB data from\nthe Planck satellite and an $H_0$ prior from Riess $et$ $al$, we find a $\\sim\n2\\sigma$ hint of a positive running of effective Planck mass. However, the hint\ngoes away when we add other low-redshift observational data including type Ia\nsupernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations and an Universe age estimation using\nthe oldest stars.\n", "  Using the quantum field theory approach developed in Phys. Rev. D. 93, 045002\n(2016), we consider particle scattering and vacuum instability in the so-called\nL-constant electric field, which is a constant electric field confined between\ntwo capacitor plates separated by a finite distance L. We obtain and analyze\nspecial sets of stationary solutions of the Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations\nwith the L-constant electric field. Then, we represent probabilities of\nparticle scattering and characteristics of the vacuum instability (related to\npair creation) in terms of the introduced solutions. From exact formulas, we\nderive asymptotic expressions for the differential mean numbers, for the total\nmean number of created particles, and for the vacuum-to-vacuum transition\nprobability. Using the equivalence principle, we demonstrate that the\ndistributions of particles created by the L-constant electric field and the\ngravitational field of a black hole have a similar thermal structure.\n", "  We describe creation and annihilation of particles at external sources in one\nspatial dimension in terms of interior-boundary conditions (IBCs). We derive\nexplicit solutions for spectra, (generalised) eigenfunctions, as well as Green\nfunctions, spectral determinants, and integrated spectral densities. Moreover,\nwe introduce a quantum graph version of IBC-Hamiltonians.\n", "  We investigate the interior dynamics of accreting black holes in\nEddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity using the homogeneous approximation and\ntaking charge as a surrogate for angular momentum, showing that accretion can\nhave an enormous impact on their inner structure. We find that, unlike in\ngeneral relativity, there is a minimum accretion rate bellow which the mass\ninflation instability, which drives the centre-of-mass streaming density to\nexponentially high values in an extremely short interval of time, does not\noccur. We further show that, above this threshold, mass inflation takes place\ninside black holes very much in the same way as in general relativity, but is\nbrought to a halt at a maximum energy density which is, in general, much\nsmaller than the fundamental energy density of the theory. We conjecture that\nsome of these results may be a common feature of modified gravity theories in\nwhich significant deviations from general relativity manifest themselves at\nvery high densities.\n", "  Neutrino oscillations are now a well-stablished and deeply studied phenomena.\nTheir mixing parameters, except for the CP phase, are measured with good\naccuracy. The three-neutrino oscillation picture in matter is currently of\ngreat interest due to the different long-baseline neutrino experiments that are\nalready running or under construction. In this work, we reanalyze the exact\nexpression for the neutrino probabilities (in a constant density medium) and\nintroduce an approximate formula. Our results are shown in a formulation that\nis independent of the parametrization and could be useful for unitary tests of\nthe leptonic mixing matrix. We illustrate how the approximation, besides being\nsimple, can reproduce the neutrino probabilities with good accuracy.\n", "  Very often it is an implied paradigm of molecular magnetism that magnetic\nmolecules in a crystal interact so weakly that measurements of dc magnetic\nobservables reflect ensemble properties of single molecules. But the number of\ncases where the assumption of virtually non-interacting molecules does not hold\ngrows steadily. A deviation from the non-interacting case can especially\nclearly be seen in clusters with antiferromagnetic couplings, where steps of\nthe low-temperature magnetization curve are smeared out with increasing\nintermolecular interaction. In this investigation we demonstrate with examples\nin one-, two, and three space dimensions how intermolecular interactions\ninfluence typical magnetic observables such as magnetization, susceptibility\nand specific heat.\n", "  Remarkable symmetry properties appear to arise in lattice calculations of\ncorrelation functions in which the lowest-lying eigenmodes of the Dirac\noperator in quark propagators are removed by hand. The Banks-Casher relation\nties the chiral condensate to the density of low lying modes; thus, it is\nplausible that removal of such modes could lead to a regime where spontaneous\nchiral symmetry breaking does not occur. Surprising, a pattern of identical\ncorrelation functions was observed that is larger than can be explained by a\nrestoration of chiral symmetry. This suggests that a larger symmetry---one that\nis not present in the QCD lagrangian---emerges when these modes are removed.\nPreviously it was argued that this emergent symmetry was SU(4). However, when\nthe low-lying modes are removed, the correlation functions of sources in the\nSU(4) 15-plet of spin-1 mesons appear to coincide with the correlation function\nof the SU(4) singlet. A natural explanation for this is an emergent symmetry\nlarger than SU(4). In this work, it is shown that there exists no continuous\nsymmetry whose generators in the field theory are spatial integrals of local\noperators that can account for the full pattern of identical correlation\nfunctions unless the apparent coincidence of the singlet channel with the\n15-plet is accidental.\n", "  The redshift dependence of the cosmic microwave background temperature is one\nof the key cosmological observables. In the standard cosmological model one has\n$T(z)=T_0(1+z)$, where $T_0$ is the present-day temperature. Deviations from\nthis behavior would imply the presence of new physics. Here we discuss how the\ncombination of all currently available direct and indirect measurements of\n$T(z)$ constrains the common phenomenological parametrization\n$T(z)=T_0(1+z)^{1-\\beta}$, and obtain the first sub-percent constraint on the\n$\\beta$ parameter, specifically $\\beta=(7.6\\pm8.0)\\times10^{-3}$ at the\n$68.3\\%$ confidence level.\n", "  We prove that for a spherically symmetric charged body two times the radius\nis always strictly greater than the charge of the body. We also prove that this\ninequality is sharp. Finally, we discuss the physical implications of this\ngeometrical inequality and present numerical examples that illustrate this\ntheorem.\n", "  High harmonic generation in benzene is studied using a mixed\nquantum-classical approach in which the electrons are described using\ntime-dependent density functional theory while the ions move classically. The\ninteraction with both circularly and linearly polarised infra-red ($\\lambda =\n800$ nm) laser pulses of duration 10 cycles (26.7 fs) is considered. The effect\nof allowing the ions to move is investigated as is the effect of including\nself-interaction corrections to the exchange-correlation functional. Our\nresults for circularly polarised pulses are compared with previous calculations\nin which the ions were kept fixed and self-interaction corrections were not\nincluded while our results for linearly polarised pulses are compared with both\nprevious calculations and experiment. We find that even for the short duration\npulses considered here, the ionic motion greatly influences the harmonic\nspectra. While ionization and ionic displacements are greatest when linearly\npolarised pulses are used, the response to circularly polarised pulses is\nalmost comparable, in agreement with previous experimental results.\n", "  We explore the potential use of the Radio Continuum (RC) survey conducted by\nthe Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to remove (delens) the lensing-induced B-mode\npolarization and thus enhance future cosmic microwave background (CMB) searches\nfor inflationary gravitational waves. Measurements of large-scale B-modes of\nthe CMB are considered to be the best method for probing gravitational waves\nfrom the cosmic inflation. Future CMB experiments will, however, suffer from\ncontamination by non-primordial B-modes, one source of which is the lensing\nB-modes. Delensing, therefore, will be required for further improvement of the\ndetection sensitivity for gravitational waves. Analyzing the use of the\ntwo-dimensional map of galaxy distribution provided by the SKA RC survey as a\nlensing mass tracer, we find that joint delensing using near future CMB\nexperiments and the SKA phase 1 will improve the constraints on the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio by more than a factor of $\\sim 2$ compared to those\nwithout the delensing analysis. Compared to the use of CMB data alone, the\ninclusion of the SKA phase 1 data will increase the significance of the\nconstraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio by a factor $1.2$-$1.6$. For LiteBIRD\ncombined with a ground-based experiment such as Simons Array and Advanced ACT,\nthe constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio when adding SKA phase 2 data is\nimproved by a factor of $2.3$-$2.7$, whereas delensing with CMB data alone\nimproves the constraints by only a factor $1.3$-$1.7$. We conclude that the use\nof SKA data is a promising method for delensing upcoming CMB experiments such\nas LiteBIRD.\n", "  SmN is a ferromagnetic semiconductor with the unusual property of an\norbital-dominant magnetic moment that is largely cancelled by an antiparallel\nspin contribution, resulting in a near-zero net moment. However, there is a\nbasic gap in the understanding of the ferromagnetic ground state, with existing\ndensity functional theory calculations providing values of the $4f$ magnetic\nmoments at odds with experimental data. To clarify the situation, we employ an\neffective $4f$ Hamiltonian incorporating spin-orbit coupling, exchange, the\ncrystal field, and $J$-mixing to calculate the ground state $4f$ moments. Our\nresults are in excellent agreement with experimental data, revealing moderate\nquenching of both spin and orbital moments to magnitudes of $\\sim 2~\\mu_B$ in\nbulk SmN, enhanced to an average of $\\sim 3~\\mu_B$ in SmN layers within a\nSmN/GdN superlattice. These calculations provide insight into recent studies of\nSmN showing that it is an unconventional superconductor at low temperatures and\ndisplays twisted magnetization phases in magnetic heterostructures.\n", "  With the heavy quark symmetry and spin rearrangement scheme, we study the\nstrong decay behavior of the hidden-charm pentaquark states with\n$J^P={\\frac{3}{2}}^{\\pm}, {\\frac{5}{2}}^{\\pm}$ assuming they are molecular\ncandidates composed of ${\\bar D}^{(\\ast)}$ and ${\\Sigma}_c^{(\\ast)}$. We obtain\nseveral typical ratios of the partial decay widths of the hidden-charm\npentaquarks. For the three S-wave $(\\bar{D}\\Sigma_c^*)$, $(\\bar{D}^*\\Sigma_c)$\nand $(\\bar{D}^*\\Sigma_c^*)$ molecular pentaquarks with $J^P={{3}/{2}}^{-}$, we\nhave obtained the ratio of their $J/\\psi N$ decay widths: $\\Gamma\\left[(\\bar\nD{\\Sigma^{\\ast}_c})\\right]:\\Gamma\\left[({\\bar\nD}^{\\ast}{\\Sigma}_c)\\right]:\\Gamma\\left[({\\bar\nD}^{\\ast}{\\Sigma^{\\ast}_c})\\right]=2.7:1.0:5.4$, which may be useful to further\ntest the possible molecular assignment of the $P_c$ states.\n", "  This work analyses the temporal coherence and correlation of twin beams\ngenerated in a quasi-phase matched nonlinear crystal in a counterpropagating\nconfiguration, ranging from the low-gain regime, where counterpropagating\nphoton pairs are generated spontaneously, to the regime of stimulated pair\nproduction, close to the MOPO (Mirrorless Optical Parametric Oscillator)\nthreshold. Here we show a critical divergence of the correlation time and\nslowing down of quantum fluctuations originating from the feedback mechanism\nresponsible of the MOPO threshold.\n", "  We present the detection of 16 optical supernova remnant (SNR) candidates in\nthe nearby spiral galaxy IC342. The candidates were detected by applying\n[SII]/H$\\alpha$ ratio criterion on observations made with the 2 m RCC telescope\nat Rozhen National Astronomical Observatory in Bulgaria. In this paper, we\nreport the coordinates, diameters, H$\\alpha$ and [SII] fluxes for 16 SNRs\ndetected in two fields of view in the IC342 galaxy. Also, we estimate that the\ncontamination of total H$\\alpha$ flux from SNRs in the observed portion of\nIC342 is 1.4%. This would represent the fractional error when the star\nformation rate (SFR) for this galaxy is derived from the total galaxy's\nH$\\alpha$ emission.\n", "  Motivated by the physics of coherently coupled, ultracold atom-molecule\nmixtures, we investigate a classical model possessing the same symmetry --\nnamely a $U(1)\\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, associated with the mass\nconservation in the mixture ($U(1)$ symmetry), times the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\nsymmetry in the phase relationship between atoms and molecules. In two spatial\ndimensions the latter symmetry can lead to a finite-temperature Ising\ntransition, associated with (quasi) phase locking between the atoms and the\nmolecules. On the other hand, the $U(1)$ symmetry has an associated\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition towards quasi-condensation of\natoms or molecules. The existence of the two transitions is found to depend\ncrucially on the population imbalance (or detuning) between atoms and\nmolecules: when the molecules are majority in the system, their BKT\nquasi-condensation transition occurs at a higher temperature than that of the\natoms; the latter has the unconventional nature of an Ising (quasi)\nphase-locking transition, lacking a finite local order parameter below the\ncritical temperature. When the balance is gradually biased towards the atoms,\nthe two transitions merge together to leave out a unique BKT transition, at\nwhich both atoms and molecules acquire quasi-long-range correlations, but only\natoms exhibit conventional BKT criticality, with binding of vortex-antivortex\npairs into short-range dipoles. The molecular vortex-antivortex excitations\nbind as well, but undergo a marked crossover from a high-temperature regime in\nwhich they are weakly bound, to a low-temperature regime of strong binding,\nreminiscent of their transition in the absence of atom-molecule coupling.\n", "  We investigate the production of heavy, neutral Higgs boson resonances and\ntheir decays to top-quark top-antiquark ($t\\bar{t}$) pairs at the Large Hadron\nCollider (LHC) at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the strong coupling of quantum\nchromodynamics (QCD). The NLO corrections to heavy Higgs boson production and\nthe Higgs-QCD interference are calculated in the large $m_t$ limit with an\neffective K-factor rescaling. The nonresonant $t\\bar{t}$ background is taken\ninto account at NLO QCD including weak-interaction corrections. In order to\nconsistently determine the total decay widths of the heavy Higgs bosons, we\nconsider for definiteness the type-II two-Higgs-doublet extension of the\nstandard model and choose three parameter scenarios that entail two heavy\nneutral Higgs bosons with masses above the $t\\bar{t}$ threshold and\nunsuppressed Yukawa couplings to top quarks. For these three scenarios we\ncompute, for the LHC operating at 13 TeV, the $t\\bar{t}$ cross section and the\ndistributions of the $t\\bar{t}$ invariant mass, of the transverse top-quark\nmomentum and rapidity, and of the cosine of the Collins-Soper angle with and\nwithout the two heavy Higgs resonances. For selected $M_{t\\bar{t}}$ bins we\nestimate the significances for detecting a heavy Higgs signal in the $t\\bar{t}$\ndileptonic and lepton plus jets decay channels.\n", "  Topology in condensed matter physics manifests itself in the emergence of\nedge or surface states protected by underlying symmetries. We review\ntwo-dimensional topological insulators whose one-dimensional edge states are\ncharacterized by spin-momentum locking and protected by time-reversal symmetry.\nWe focus in particular on their transport properties in the presence of\nelectron interactions, which can allow the onset of different backscattering\nmechanisms, thus leading to deviations from the quantized conductance observed\nin the ballistic regime. The combined presence of helicity and electron\ninteractions creates a new paradigm of the one-dimensional world called helical\nLuttinger liquid, whose theoretical properties and experimental observations\nare reviewed.\n", "  The quantum-mechanical counterpart of a classical random walk offers a rich\ndynamics that has recently been shown to include topologically protected bound\nstates (zero-modes) at boundaries or domain walls. Here we show that a\ntopological zero-mode may acquire a dynamical role in the presence of\nnonlinearities. We consider a one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walk that\ncombines zero-modes with a particle-conserving nonlinear relaxation mechanism.\nThe presence of both particle-hole and chiral symmetry converts two zero-modes\nof opposite chirality into an attractor-repeller pair of the nonlinear\ndynamics. This makes it possible to steer the walker towards a domain wall and\ntrap it there.\n", "  Collider experiments provide an opportunity to shed light on dark matter (DM)\nself-interactions. In this work, we study the possibility of generating DM\nbound states -- the Darkonium -- at the LHC and discuss how the annihilation\ndecay of the Darkonium produces force carriers. We focus on two popular\nscenarios that contain large DM self-couplings: the Higgsinos in the\n$\\lambda$-SUSY model, and self-interacting DM (SIDM) framework. After forming\nbound states, the DM particles annihilate into force mediators, which decay\ninto the standard model particles either through a prompt or displaced process.\nThis generates interesting signals for the heavy resonance search. We calculate\nthe production rate of bound states and study the projected future constraints\nfrom the existing heavy resonance searches.\n", "  We study Bogoliubov excitations of a spinor Bose Einstein condensate in a\nhoneycomb periodic potential, in the presence of a Zeeman field and of a\nspin-orbit coupling specific for photonic systems, which is due to the energy\nsplitting between TE and TM polarized eigenstates. We also consider\nspin-anisotropic interactions typical for cavity polaritons. We show that the\nnon-trivial topology of the single particle case is also present for the\ninteracting system. At low condensate density, the topology of the\nsingle-particle bands is transferred to the bogolon dispersion. At a critical\nvalue, the self-induced Zeeman field at the Dirac points of the dispersion\nbecomes equal to the real Zeeman field and then exceeds it. The gap is thus\nclosed and then re-opened with inverted Chern numbers. This change of topology\nis accompanied by a change of the propagation directions of the one-way edge\nmodes. This result demonstrates that the chirality of a topological insulator\ncan be reversed by collective effects in a Bose-Einstein condensate.\n", "  Direct numerical integrations of the two-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation\nare carried out for compact objects orbiting a supermassive black hole (SBH) at\nthe center of a galaxy. As in Papers I-III, the diffusion coefficients\nincorporate the effects of the lowest-order post-Newtonian corrections to the\nequations of motion. In addition, terms describing the loss of orbital energy\nand angular momentum due to the 5/2-order post-Newtonian terms are included. In\nthe steady state, captures are found to occur in two regimes that are clearly\ndifferentiated in terms of energy, or semimajor axis; these two regimes are\nnaturally characterized as \"plunges\" (low binding energy) and \"EMRIs,\" or\nextreme-mass-ratio inspirals (high binding energy). The capture rate, and the\ndistribution of orbital elements of the captured objects, are presented for two\nsteady-state models based on the Milky Way: one with a relatively high density\nof remnants and one with a lower density. In both models, but particularly in\nthe second, the steady-state energy distribution and the distribution of\norbital elements of the captured objects are substantially different than if\nthe Bahcall-Wolf energy distribution were assumed. The ability of classical\nrelaxation to soften the blocking effects of the Schwarzschild barrier is\nquantified.These results, together with those of Papers I-III, suggest that a\nFokker-Planck description can adequately represent the dynamics of collisional\nloss cones in the relativistic regime.\n", "  We demonstrate a scanning gate grid measurement technique consisting in\nmeasuring the conductance of a quantum point contact (QPC) as a function of\ngate voltage at each tip position. Unlike conventional scanning gate\nexperiments, it allows investigating QPC conductance plateaus affected by the\ntip at these positions. We compensate the capacitive coupling of the tip to the\nQPC and discover that interference fringes coexist with distorted QPC plateaus.\nWe spatially resolve the mode structure for each plateau.\n", "  I discuss the theoretical interpretation of the top-quark mass, which is\nextracted in standard and alternative measurements at the LHC. In particular, I\npoint out that the top mass extracted in analyses relying on the use of Monte\nCarlo event generators must be close to the pole mass and review recent work\naiming at estimating the theoretical uncertainty.\n", "  We derive a generalized deviation equation -- analogous to the well-known\ngeodesic deviation equation -- for test bodies in General Relativity. Our\nresult encompasses and generalizes previous extensions of the standard geodesic\ndeviation equation. We show how the standard as well as a generalized deviation\nequation can be used to measure the curvature of spacetime by means of a set of\ntest bodies. In particular, we provide exact solutions for the curvature by\nusing the standard deviation equation as well as its next order generalization.\n", "  We present optical depth and temperature maps of the Perseus molecular cloud,\nobtained combining dust emission data from the Herschel and Planck satellites\nand 2MASS/NIR dust extinction maps. The maps have a resolution of 36 arcsec in\nthe Herschel regions, and of 5 arcmin elsewhere. The dynamic range of the\noptical depth map ranges from $1\\times10^{-2}\\, \\mathrm{mag}$ up to $20\n\\,\\mathrm{mag}$ in the equivalent K band extinction. We also evaluate the ratio\nbetween the $2.2 \\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ extinction coefficient and the $850\n\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ opacity. The value we obtain is close to the one found in the\nOrion B molecular cloud. We show that the cumulative and the differential area\nfunction of the data (which is proportional to the probability distribution\nfunction of the cloud column density) follow power laws with index respectively\n$\\simeq -2$, and $\\simeq -3$. We use WISE data to improve current YSO\ncatalogues based mostly on \\emph{Spitzer} data and we build an up-to-date\nselection of Class~I/0 objects. Using this selection, we evaluate the local\nSchmidt law, $\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{YSO}} \\propto \\Sigma_{\\mathrm{gas}}^{\\beta}$,\nshowing that $\\beta=2.4 \\pm 0.6$. Finally, we show that the area-extinction\nrelation is important for determining the star formation rate in the cloud,\nwhich is in agreement with other recent works.\n", "  We show how to compute the optical functions when Rydberg Excitons appear,\nincluding the effect of the coherence between the electron-hole pair and the\nelectromagnetic field. We use the Real Density Matrix Approach (RDMA), which,\ncombined with Green's function method, enables one to derive analytical\nexpressions for the optical functions. Choosing the susceptibility, we\nperformed numerical calculations appropriate to a Cu$_2$0 crystal. The effect\nof the coherence is displayed in the line shape. We also examine in details and\nexplain the dependence of the oscillator strength and the resonance placement\non the state number. We report a good agreement with recently published\nexperimental data.\n", "  The paper presents a theoretical work on the dynamics of Coulomb explosion\nfor spherical nanoplasmas composed by two different ion species. Particular\nattention has been dedicated to study the energy spectra of the ions with the\nlarger charge-to-mass ratio. The connection between the formation of shock\nshells and the energy spread of the ions has been the object of a detailed\nanalysis, showing that under particular conditions the width of the asymptotic\nenergy spectrum tends to become very narrow, which leads to a multi-valued ion\nphase-space. The conditions to generate a quasi mono-energetic ion spectrum\nhave been rigorously demonstrated and verifed by numerical simulations, using a\ntechnique that, exploiting the spherical symmetry of the problem, allows one to\nobtain very accurate and precise results.\n", "  A nanophononic metamaterial is a new type of nanostructured material that\nfeatures an array, or a forest, of intrinsically distributed resonating\nsubstructures. Each substructure exhibits numerous local resonances, each of\nwhich may hybridize with the phonon dispersion of the underlying host material\ncausing significant reductions in the group velocities and consequently a\nreduction in the lattice thermal conductivity. In this paper, molecular\ndynamics simulations are utilized to investigate both the dynamics and the\nthermal transport properties of a nanophononic metamaterial configuration\nconsisting of a freely suspended silicon membrane with an array of silicon\nnanopillars standing on the surface. The simulations yield results consistent\nwith earlier lattice-dynamics based predictions which showed a reduction in the\nthermal conductivity due to the presence of the local resonators. Using a\nspectral energy density approach, in which only simulation data is utilized and\nno a priori information on the nanostructure resonant phonon modes is provided,\nwe show direct evidence of the existence of resonance hybridizations as an\ninherent mechanism contributing to the slowing down of thermal transport in\nthis system.\n", "  Recently, the nodal line semimetals have attracted considerable interests in\ncondensed matter physics. We show that their distinct band structure can be\ndetected by measuring the collective modes. In particular, we find that the\ndependence of the plasmon frequency $\\omega_p$ on the electron density $n$\nfollows a $\\omega_p \\sim n^{1/4}$ law in the long wavelength limit. Our results\nwill be useful in the ongoing search for new candidates of nodal line\nsemimetals.\n", "  We analyze a scheme for storage of entanglement quantified by the quantum\nFisher information in the two-axis countertwisting model. A characteristic\nfeature of the two-axis countertwisting Hamiltonian is the existence of the\nfour stable center and two unstable saddle fixed points in the mean-field phase\nportrait. The entangled state is generated dynamically from an initial spin\ncoherent state located around an unstable saddle fixed point. At an optimal\nmoment of time the state is shifted to a position around stable center fixed\npoints by a single rotation, where its dynamics and properties are\napproximately frozen. We also discuss evolution with noise. In some cases the\neffect of noise turns out to be relatively weak, which is explained by parity\nconservation.\n", "  Materials with a negative dielectric permittivity (e.g. metals) display high\nreflectance and can be shaped into nanoscale optical-resonators exhibiting\nextreme mode confinement, a central theme of nanophotonics. However, the\nability to $actively$ tune these effects remains elusive. By photoexciting free\ncarriers in 4H-SiC, we induce dramatic changes in reflectance near the\n\"Reststrahlen band\" where the permittivity is negative due to charge\noscillations of the polar optical phonons in the mid-infrared. We infer\ncarrier-induced changes in the permittivity required for useful tunability (~\n40 cm$^{-1}$) in nanoscale resonators, providing a direct avenue towards the\nrealization of actively tunable nanophotonic devices in the mid-infrared to\nterahertz spectral range.\n", "  We introduce methods which allow observed galaxy clustering to be used\ntogether with observed luminosity or stellar mass functions to constrain the\nphysics of galaxy formation. We show how the projected two-point correlation\nfunction of galaxies in a large semi-analytic simulation can be estimated to\nbetter than ~10% using only a very small subsample of the subhalo merger trees.\nThis allows measured correlations to be used as constraints in a Monte Carlo\nMarkov Chain exploration of the astrophysical and cosmological parameter space.\nAn important part of our scheme is an analytic profile which captures the\nsimulated satellite distribution extremely well out to several halo virial\nradii. This is essential to reproduce the correlation properties of the full\nsimulation at intermediate separations. As a first application, we use\nlow-redshift clustering and abundance measurements to constrain a recent\nversion of the Munich semi-analytic model. The preferred values of most\nparameters are consistent with those found previously, with significantly\nimproved constraints and somewhat shifted \"best\" values for parameters that\nprimarily affect spatial distributions. Our methods allow multi-epoch data on\ngalaxy clustering and abundance to be used as joint constraints on galaxy\nformation. This may lead to significant constraints on cosmological parameters\neven after marginalising over galaxy formation physics.\n", "  Drawing on experimental data for baryon resonances, Hamiltonian effective\nfield theory (HEFT) is used to predict the positions of the finite-volume\nenergy levels to be observed in lattice QCD simulations of the lowest-lying\n$J^P=1/2^-$ nucleon excitation. In the initial analysis, the phenomenological\nparameters of the Hamiltonian model are constrained by experiment and the\nfinite-volume eigenstate energies are a prediction of the model. The agreement\nbetween HEFT predictions and lattice QCD results obtained on volumes with\nspatial lengths of 2 and 3 fm is excellent. These lattice results also admit a\nmore conventional analysis where the low-energy coefficients are constrained by\nlattice QCD results, enabling a determination of resonance properties from\nlattice QCD itself. Finally, the role and importance of various components of\nthe Hamiltonian model are examined.\n", "  Fe-gluconate was studied by means of the M\\\"ossbauer spectroscopy in the\ntemperature interval of 80-305K. The measured spectra were analyzed in terms of\ntwo subspectra and, alternatively, two distributions of the quadrupole\nsplitting. The major component (ca.85%) was identified as due to high-spin Fe2+\nions while the identification of the minor component (ca.15%) was not unique:\nsome characteristics are in favour of the high-spin Fe3+ state while other ones\nare consistent with the low-spin Fe2+ state. Values of the Debye temperature\nwere determined for both phases from a temperature dependence of the center\nshift as well as from that of the spectral area. The force constant for the\nhigh-spin ferrous atoms was evaluated to be equal to 44 N/m (243 cm-1).\n", "  We calculate the orbital magnetic susceptibility $\\chi_{\\mathrm{orb}}$ for an\n8-band tight-binding model of gapless and gapped graphene using Green's\nfunctions. Analogously, we study $\\chi_{\\mathrm{orb}}$ for a $\\mathrm{MoS_2}$\n12-band model. For both materials, we unravel the character of the processes\ninvolved in the magnetic response by looking at the contribution at each point\nof the Brillouin zone. By this, a clear distinction between intra- and\ninterband excitations is generally possible and we are able to predict\nqualitative features of $\\chi_{\\mathrm{orb}}$ only through the knowledge of the\nband structure. The study is complemented by comparing the magnetic response\nwith that of 2-band lattice Hamiltonians which reduce to the Dirac and\nBernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) models in the continuum limit.\n", "  We present $\\beta$-FeSe magnetotransport data, and describe them\ntheoretically. Using a simplified microscopic model with two correlated\neffective orbitals, we determined the normal state electrical conductivity and\nHall coefficient, using Kubo formalism. With model parameters relevant for\nFe-chalcogenides, we describe the observed effect of the structural transition\non the ab-plane electrical resistivity, as well as on the magnetoresistance.\nTemperature-dependent Hall coefficient data were measured at 16 Tesla, and\ntheir theoretical description improves upon inclusion of moderate electron\ncorrelations. We confirm the effect of the structural transition on the\nelectronic structure, finding deformation-induced band splittings comparable to\nthose reported in angle-resolved photoemission.\n", "  We study numerically a disordered transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian with\nlong-range couplings. This model was recently investigated experimentally in a\ntrapped-ion quantum simulator and was found to exhibit features of many-body\nlocalization at strong disorder. We use exact diagonalization to study the\ncollective state preservation and the eigenstate entanglement structure as a\nfunction of both disorder strength and interaction range. Our numerical\nresults, using the same system sizes as the experiment, verify the observation\nof many-body localization reported in the recent quantum simulation experiment,\nand point to directions for future experiments.\n", "  Layered oxypnictide Sm$_{1-x}$Th$_x$OFeAs (Sm-1111) is an ideal candidate to\nbe probed by intrinsic multiple Andreev reflections effect (IMARE)\nspectroscopy. Using the classical \"break-junction\" technique, we formed\nballistic Andreev arrays of identical S--n--S-contacts, where $S$ is\nsuperconductor, and $n$ is a layer of normal metal. For $T < T_C$, the I(V)\ncurve shows an excess-current and a subharmonic gap structure (SGS): a set of\nsharp dI(V)/dV-dips at positions which depend on the superconducting gap value,\nthe number of junctions in the array, and the natural subharmonic order, thus\nmanifesting the effect of intrinsic multiple Andreev reflections. Here we\npresent the I(V) and dI(V)/dV with up to 4 SGS dips for Andreev arrays formed\nin optimally doped Sm-1111 with critical temperatures $T_C \\approx 49$\\,K, as\nwell as in underdoped samples with $T_C \\approx 37$\\,K. We show that a number\nof Andreev subharmonics facilitates the determination of the superconducting\ngap with a better accuracy.\n", "  The coupled cluster method (CCM) is employed to very high orders of\napproximation to study the ground-state (GS) properties of the spin-$s$\nHeisenberg antiferromagnet (with isotropic interactions, all of equal strength,\nbetween nearest-neighbour pairs only) on the honeycomb lattice. We calculate\nwith high accuracy the complete set of GS parameters that fully describes the\nlow-energy behaviour of the system, in terms of an effective magnon field\ntheory, viz., the energy per spin, the magnetic order parameter (i.e., the\nsublattie magnetization), the spin stiffness and the zero-field (uniform,\ntransverse) magnetic susceptibility, for all values of the spin quantum number\n$s$ in the range $\\frac{1}{2} \\leq s \\leq \\frac{9}{2}$. The CCM data points are\nused to calculate the leading quantum corrections to the classical ($s\n\\rightarrow \\infty$) values of these low-energy parameters, considered as\nlarge-$s$ asymptotic expansions.\n", "  We show both the leading and subleading double soft theorems of the nonlinear\nsigma model follow from a shift symmetry enforcing Adler's zero condition in\nthe presence of an unbroken global symmetry. They do not depend on the\nunderlying coset G/H and are universal infrared behaviors of Nambu-Goldstone\nbosons. Although nonlinear sigma models contain an infinite number of\ninteraction vertices, the double soft limit is determined entirely by a single\nfour-point interaction, together with the existence of Adler's zeros.\n", "  We present a systematic attempt to study magnetic null points and the\nassociated magnetic energy conversion in kinetic Particle-in-Cell simulations\nof various plasma configurations. We address three-dimensional simulations\nperformed with the semi-implicit kinetic electromagnetic code iPic3D in\ndifferent setups: variations of a Harris current sheet, dipolar and quadrupolar\nmagnetospheres interacting with the solar wind; and a relaxing turbulent\nconfiguration with multiple null points. Spiral nulls are more likely created\nin space plasmas: in all our simulations except lunar magnetic anomaly and\nquadrupolar mini-magnetosphere the number of spiral nulls prevails over the\nnumber of radial nulls by a factor of 3-9. We show that often magnetic nulls do\nnot indicate the regions of intensive energy dissipation. Energy dissipation\nevents caused by topological bifurcations at radial nulls are rather rare and\nshort-lived. The so-called X-lines formed by the radial nulls in the Harris\ncurrent sheet and lunar magnetic anomaly simulations are rather stable and do\nnot exhibit any energy dissipation. Energy dissipation is more powerful in the\nvicinity of spiral nulls enclosed by magnetic flux ropes with strong currents\nat their axes (their cross-sections resemble 2D magnetic islands). These null\nlines reminiscent of Z-pinches efficiently dissipate magnetic energy due to\nsecondary instabilities such as the two-stream or kinking instability,\naccompanied by changes in magnetic topology. Current enhancements accompanied\nby spiral nulls may signal magnetic energy conversion sites in the\nobservational data.\n", "  Various approaches of defining and determining work performed on a quantum\nsystem are compared. Any operational definition of work, however, must allow\nfor two facts, first, that work characterizes a process rather than an\ninstantaneous state of a system, and, second, that quantum systems are\nsensitive to the interactions with a measurement apparatus. We compare\ndifferent measurement scenarios on the basis of the resulting post-measurement\nstates and the according probabilities for finding a particular work value. In\nparticular, we analyze a recently proposed work-meter for the case of a\nGaussian pointer state and compare it with the results obtained by two\nprojective and, alternatively, two Gaussian measurements. In the limit of a\nstrong effective measurement strength the work distribution of projective two\nenergy measurements can be recovered. In the opposite limit the average of work\nbecomes independent of any measurement. Yet the fluctuations about this value\ndiverge. The performance of the work-meter is illustrated by the example of a\nspin in a suddenly changing magnetic field.\n", "  Aims. We measure the deuterium fraction, RD, and the CO-depletion factor, fd,\ntoward a number of starless and protostellar cores in the L1688 region of the\nOphiuchus molecular cloud complex and search for variations based upon\nenvironmental differences across L1688. The kinematic properties of the dense\ngas traced by the N2H+ and N2D+ (1-0) lines are also discussed.\n  Methods. RD has been measured via observations of the J=1-0 transition of\nN2H+ and N2D+ toward 33 dense cores in different regions of L1688. fd estimates\nhave been done using C17O(1-0) and 850 micron dust continuum emission from the\nSCUBA survey. All line observations were carried out with the IRAM 30 meter\nantenna.\n  Results. The dense cores show large (2-40%) deuterium fractions, with\nsignificant variations between the sub-regions of L1688. The CO-depletion\nfactor also varies from one region to another (1-7). Two different correlations\nare found between deuterium fraction and CO-depletion factor: cores in regions\nA, B2 and I show increasing RD with increasing fd, similar to previous studies\nof deuterium fraction in pre-stellar cores; cores in regions B1, B1B2, C, E, F\nand H show a steeper RD-fd correlation, with large deuterium fractions\noccurring in fairly quiescent gas with relatively low CO freeze-out factors.\nThese are probably recently formed, centrally concentrated starless cores which\nhave not yet started the contraction phase toward protostellar formation. We\nalso find that the deuterium fraction is affected by the amount of turbulence,\ndust temperature and distance from heating sources in all regions of L1688,\nalthough no clear trend is found.\n", "  Quasi-static strain-controlled measurements of stress vs strain curves in\nmacroscopic amorphous solids result in a nonlinear looking curve that ends up\neither in mechanical collapse or in a steady-state with fluctuations around a\nmean stress that remains constant with increasing strain. It is therefore very\ntempting to fit a nonlinear expansion of the stress in powers of the strain. We\nargue here that at low temperatures the meaning of such an expansion needs to\nbe reconsidered. We point out the enormous difference between quenched and\nannealed averages of the stress vs. strain curves, and propose that a useful\ndescription of the mechanical response is given by a stress (or strain)\ndependent shear modulus for which a theoretical evaluation exists. The elastic\nresponse is piece-wise linear rather than nonlinear.\n", "  We present a comparative far-infrared reflection spectroscopy study of\nphonons, phase transitions, spin-phonon and electron-phonon interactions in\nisostructural multiferroic iron borates of gadolinium and terbium. The behavior\nof phonon modes registered in a wide temperature range is consistent with a\nweak first-order structural phase transition (Ts = 143 for GdFe3(BO3)4 and 200\nK for TbFe3(BO3)4) from high-symmetry high-temperature R32 structure into\nlow-symmetry low-temperature P3121 one. The temperature dependences of\nfrequencies, oscillator strengths, and damping constants of some low-frequency\nmodes reveal an appreciable lattice anharmonicity. Peculiarities in the phonon\nmode behavior in both compounds at the temperature of an antiferromagnetic\nordering (TN = 32 K for GdFe3(BO3)4 and 40 K for TbFe3(BO3)4) evidence the\nspin-phonon interaction. In the energy range of phonons, GdFe3(BO3)4 has no\nelectronic levels but TbFe3(BO3)4 possesses several ones. We observe an onset\nof new bands in the excitation spectrum of TbFe3(BO3)4, due to a resonance\ninteraction between a lattice phonon and 4f electronic crystal-field\nexcitations of Tb3+. This interaction causes delocalization of the CF\nexcitations, their Davydov splitting, and formation of coupled electron-phonon\nmodes.\n", "  A continuous variable measurement device independent multi-party quantum\ncommunication protocol is investigated in this paper. Utilizing distributed\ncontinuous variable Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, this protocol can\nimplement both quantum cryptographic conference and quantum secret sharing. We\nanalyze the security of the protocol against both entangling cloner attack and\ncoherent attack. Entangling cloner attack is a practical individual attack, and\ncoherent attack is the optimal attack Eve can implement. Simulation results\nshow that coherent attack can greatly reduce the secret key rate. Different\nkinds of entangled attacks are compared and we finally discuss the optimal\ncoherent attacks.\n", "  We explore from a statistical point of view the far-infrared (far-IR) and\nsub-millimeter (sub-mm) properties of a large sample of LBGs (22,000) at z~3 in\nthe COSMOS field. The large number of galaxies allows us to split it in several\nbins as a function of UV luminosity, UV slope, and stellar mass to better\nsample their variety. We perform stacking analysis in PACS (100 and 160 um),\nSPIRE (250, 350 and 500 um) and AzTEC (1.1 mm) images. Our stacking procedure\ncorrects the biases induced by galaxy clustering and incompleteness of our\ninput catalogue in dense regions. We obtain the full IR spectral energy\ndistributions (SED) of subsamples of LBGs and derive the mean IR luminosity as\na function of UV luminosity, UV slope, and stellar mass. The average IRX is\nroughly constant over the UV luminosity range, with a mean of 7.9 (1.8 mag).\nHowever, it is correlated with UV slope, and stellar mass. We investigate using\na statistically-controlled stacking analysis as a function of (stellar mass, UV\nslope) the dispersion of the IRX-UVslope and IRX-M* plane. Our results enable\nus to study the average relation between star-formation rate (SFR) and stellar\nmass, and we show that our LBG sample lies on the main sequence of star\nformation at z~3.\n", "  We construct phase diagrams for charged rodlike colloids within the\nsecond-virial approximation as a function of rod concentration, salt\nconcentration, and colloidal charge. Besides the expected isotropic-nematic\ntransition, we also find parameter regimes with a coexistence between a nematic\nand a second, more highly aligned nematic phase including an\nisotropic-nematic-nematic triple point and a nematic-nematic critical point,\nwhich can all be explained in terms of the twisting effect. We compute the\nFrank elastic constants to see if the twist elastic constant can become\nnegative, which would indicate the possibility of a cholesteric phase\nspontaneously forming. Although the twisting effect reduces the twist elastic\nconstant, we find that it always remains positive. In addition, we find that\nfor finite aspect-ratio rods the twist elastic constant is also always\npositive, such that there is no evidence of chiral symmetry breaking due to a\nuniaxial charge distribution.\n", "  We study the normal modes and quasi-normal modes (QNMs) in circular\ndielectric microcavities through non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, which come from the\nmodifications due to system-environment coupling. Differences between the two\ntypes of modes are studied in detail, including the existence of resonances\ntails. Numerical calculations of the eigenvalues reveal the Lamb shift in the\nmicrocavity due to its interaction with the environment. We also investigate\nrelations between the Lamb shift and quantized angular momentum of the\nwhispering gallery mode as well as the refractive index of the microcavity. For\nthe latter, we make use of the similarity between the Helmholtz equation and\nthe Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, in which the refractive index can be treated as a\ncontrol parameter of effective potential. Our result can be generalized to\nother open quantum systems with a potential term.\n", "  Magnetic skyrmions have attracted considerable attention recently for their\nhuge potential in spintronic applications. Generally skyrmions are big compared\nto the atomic lattice constant, which allows for the Ginzburg-Landau type\ndescription in the continuum limit. Such a description successfully captures\nthe main experimental observations on skyrmions in B20 compound without\ninversion symmetry. Skyrmions can also exist in inversion-symmetric magnets\nwith competing interactions. Here we derive a general Ginzburg-Landau theory\nfor skyrmions in these magnets valid in the long wavelength limit. We study the\nunusual static and dynamical properties of skyrmions based on the derived\nGinzburg-Landau theory. We show that an easy axis spin anisotropy is sufficient\nto stabilize a skyrmion lattice. Interestingly, the skyrmion in\ninversion-symmetric magnets has a new internal degree of freedom associated\nwith the rotation of helicity, i.e. the \"spin\" of the skyrmion as a particle,\nin addition to the usual translational motion of skyrmions (orbital motion).\nThe orbital and spin degree of freedoms of an individual skyrmion can couple to\neach other, and give rise to unusual behavior that is absent for the skyrmions\nstabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The derived\nGinzburg-Landau theory provides a convenient and general framework to discuss\nskyrmion physics and will facilitate the search for skyrmions in\ninversion-symmetric magnets.\n", "  The $^{9}$Be($^{14}$C, $\\alpha$$\\gamma$) reaction at E$_{Lab}$=30 and 35 MeV\nwas used to study excited states of $^{19}$O. The Florida State University\n(FSU) $\\gamma$ detector array was used to detect $\\gamma$ radiation in\ncoincidence with charged particles detected and identified with a silicon\n$\\Delta$E-E particle telescope. Gamma decays have been observed for the first\ntime from six states ranging from 368 to 2147 keV above the neutron separation\nenergy (S$_{n}$=3962 keV) in $^{19}$O. The $\\gamma$ decaying states are\ninterspersed among states previously observed to decay by neutron emission. The\nability of electromagnetic decay to compete successfully with neutron decay is\nexplained in terms of neutron angular momentum barriers and small spectroscopic\nfactors implying higher spin and complex structure for these intruder states.\nThese results illustrate the need for complementary experimental approaches to\nbest illuminate the complete nuclear structure.\n", "  We study the effect of adding disorder to the exactly solvable Kitaev model\non the hyper-honeycomb lattice, which hosts both gapped and gapless spin liquid\nphases with an emergent $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. The latter has an unusual\ngapless spectrum of Majorana fermion excitations, with a co-dimension-two Fermi\nring. We thus address the question of the interplay of topological physics and\ndisorder by considering the properties of isolated single and pair of\nvacancies. We show that near the vacancies, the local magnetic response to a\nfield $h_z$ is parametrically enhanced in comparison to the pristine bulk.\nUnlike the previously studied case of the 2D honeycomb Kitaev model, the\nvacancies do not bind a flux of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. In the gapped\nphase, an isolated vacancy gives rise to effectively free spin-half moments\nwith a non-universal coupling to an external field. In the gapless phase, the\nlow-field magnetization is suppressed parametrically, to $(-\\ln h_z)^{-1/2}$\nbecause of interactions with the surrounding spin-liquid. We also show that a\npair of vacancies is subject to a sublattice-dependent interaction on account\nof coupling through the bulk spin liquid, which is spatially anisotropic even\nwhen all Kitaev couplings have equal strength. This coupling is thus\nexponentially suppressed with distance in the gapped phase. In the gapless\nphase, two vacancies on the same (opposite) sublattice exhibit an enhanced\n(suppressed) low-field response, amounting to an effectively\n(anti-)ferromagnetic interaction.\n", "  We consider the Tonks-Girardeau gas subject to a random external potential.\nIf the disorder is such that the underlying one-particle Hamiltonian displays\nlocalization (which is known to be generically the case), we show that there is\nexponential decay of correlations in the many-body eigenstates. Moreover, there\nis no Bose-Einstein condensation and no superfluidity, even at zero\ntemperature.\n", "  We investigate properties of low-energy QCD in a finite spatial volume, but\nwith arbitrary temperature. In the limit of small temperature and small cube\nsize compared to the pion Compton wavelength, Leutwyler has shown that the\neffective theory describing low-energy QCD reduces to that of quantum mechanics\non the coset manifold, which is the so-called delta regime of chiral\nperturbation theory. We solve this quantum mechanics analytically for the case\nof a $U(1)_L \\times U(1)_R$ subgroup of chiral symmetry, and numerically for\nthe case of $SU(2)_L \\times SU(2)_R$. We utilize the quantum mechanical\nspectrum to compute the mass gap and chiral condensate, and investigate\nsymmetry restoration in a finite spatial volume as a function of temperature.\nBecause we obtain the spectrum for non-zero values of the quark mass, we are\nable to interpolate between the rigid rotor limit, which emerges at vanishing\nquark mass, and the harmonic approximation, which is referred to as the\np-regime. We find that the applicability of perturbation theory about the rotor\nlimit largely requires lighter-than-physical quarks. As a stringent check of\nour results, we raise the temperature to that of the inverse cube size. When\nthis condition is met, the quantum mechanics reduces to a matrix model. The\ncondensate we obtain in this limit agrees with that determined analytically in\nthe epsilon regime.\n", "  Contextuality provides a unifying paradigm for nonclassical aspects of\nquantum probabilities and resources of quantum information. Unfortunately, most\nforms of quantum contextuality remain experimentally unexplored due to the\ndifficulty of performing sequences of projective measurements on individual\nquantum systems. Here we show that two-point correlations between binary\ncompatible observables are sufficient to reveal any form of contextuality. This\nallows us to design simple experiments that are more robust against\nimperfections and easier to analyze, thus opening the door for observing\ninteresting forms of contextuality, including those requiring quantum systems\nof high dimensions. In addition, it allows us to connect contextuality to\ncommunication complexity scenarios and reformulate a recent result relating\ncontextuality and quantum computation.\n", "  The Lax-Sato approach to the hierarchies of Manakov-Santini type is\nformalized in order to extend it to a more general class of integrable systems.\nFor this purpose some linear operators are introduced, which must satisfy some\nintegrability conditions, one of them is the Rota-Baxter identity. The theory\nis illustrated by means of the algebra of Laurent series, the related\nhierarchies are classified and examples, also new, of Manakov-Santini type\nsystems are constructed, including those that are related to the dispersionless\nmodified Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation and so called dispersionless r-th\nsystems.\n", "  In this paper we report on lattice simulations of SU(3)-QCD with non-zero\nchiral chemical potential. We focus on the influence of the chiral chemical\npotential on the confinement/deconfinement phase transition and the\nbreaking/restoration of chiral symmetry. The simulation is carried out with\ndynamical Wilson fermions. We find that the critical temperature rises as the\nchiral chemical potential grows.\n", "  Interfaces formed by two different organic semiconductors often exhibit a\nlarge conductivity, originating from transfer of charge between the constituent\nmaterials. The precise mechanisms driving charge transfer and determining its\nmagnitude remain vastly unexplored, and are not understood microscopically. To\nstart addressing this issue, we have performed a systematic study of highly\nreproducible single-crystal interfaces based on rubrene and Fx-TCNQ, a family\nof molecules whose electron affinity can be tuned by increasing the fluorine\ncontent. The combined analysis of transport and scanning Kelvin probe\nmeasurements reveals that the interfacial charge carrier density, resistivity,\nand activation energy correlate with the electron affinity of Fx-TCNQ crystals,\nwith a higher affinity resulting in larger charge transfer. Although the\ntransport properties can be described consistently and quantitatively using a\nmobility-edge model, we find that a quantitative analysis of charge transfer in\nterms of single-particle band diagrams reveals a discrepancy ~ 100 meV in the\ninterfacial energy level alignment. We attribute the discrepancy to phenomena\nknown to affect the energetics of organic semiconductors, which are neglected\nby a single-particle description, such as molecular relaxation and band-gap\nrenormalization due to screening. The systematic behavior of the\nFx-TCNQ/rubrene interfaces opens the possibility to investigate these phenomena\nexperimentally, under controlled conditions.\n", "  Motivated by the recent diphoton excesses reported by both ATLAS and CMS\ncollaborations, we suggest that a new heavy spinless particle is produced in\ngluon fusion at the LHC and decays to a couple of lighter pseudoscalars which\nthen decay to photons. The new resonances could arise from a new strongly\ninteracting sector and couple to Standard Model gauge bosons only via the\ncorresponding Wess-Zumino-Witten anomaly. We present a detailed recast of the\nnewest 13 TeV data from ATLAS and CMS together with the 8 TeV data to scan the\nconsistency of the parameter space for those resonances.\n", "  We derive a markovian master equation for the internal dynamics of an\nensemble of two-level atoms including all effects related to the quantization\nof their motion. Our equation provides a unifying picture of the consequences\nof recoil and indistinguishability of atoms beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime on\nboth their dissipative and conservative dynamics, and applies equally well to\ndistinguishable and indistinguishable atoms. We give general expressions for\nthe decay rates and the dipole-dipole shifts for any motional states, and we\nfind closed-form formulas for a number of relevant states (Gaussian states,\nFock states and thermal states). In particular, we show that dipole-dipole\ninteractions and cooperative photon emission can be modulated through the\nexternal state of motion.\n", "  We present a complete study of the leading-twist quark Wigner distributions\nin the nucleon, discussing both the $\\mathsf T$-even and $\\mathsf T$-odd\nsector, along with all the possible configurations of the quark and nucleon\npolarizations. We identify the basic multipole structures associated with each\ndistribution in the transverse phase space, providing a transparent\ninterpretation of the spin-spin and spin-orbit correlations of quarks and\nnucleon encoded in these functions. Projecting the multipole parametrization of\nthe Wigner functions onto the transverse-position and the transverse-momentum\nspaces, we find a natural link with the corresponding multipole\nparametrizations for the generalized parton distributions and\ntransverse-momentum dependent parton distributions, respectively. Finally, we\nshow results for all the distributions in the transverse phase space,\nintroducing a representation that allows one to visualize simultaneously the\nmultipole structures in both the transverse-position and transverse-momentum\nspaces.\n", "  Motivated by excess diphoton events reported by ATLAS and CMS, we show that\ncomposite pseudoscalars, bound states of heavy fermions under a new confining\ngauge theory, can be pair-produced by Drell-Yan production if the constituent\nparticles are electrically charged. The decays of these pion-like bound states\ninto two photons can explain the observed events near 750 GeV. The model\npredicts that there should be significant numbers of 4-photon events from\ndecays of the pseudoscalar pairs, as well as same-sign dilepton pairs at a\nsomewhat lower invariant mass, or multijet signals, coming from decays of\ncharge-2 pseudoscalars. These states and their decays are necessary for\navoiding stable charged baryon-like relics in the new confining sector. A\nneutral baryon-like dark matter candidate of mass $\\sim N_c\\times 375$ GeV is a\nfurther prediction of the model, for SU($N_c$) confining gauge group.\n", "  We present extensive calculations of the optical and plasmonic properties of\na graphene sheet carrying a dc current. By calculating analytically the\ndensity-density response function of current-carrying states at finite\ntemperature, we demonstrate that an applied dc current modifies the Pauli\nblocking mechanism and that absorption acquires a birefringent character with\nrespect to the angle between the in-plane light polarization and current flow.\nEmploying the random phase approximation at finite temperature, we show that\ngraphene plasmons display a degree of non-reciprocity and collimation that can\nbe tuned with the applied current. We discuss the possibility to measure these\neffects.\n", "  We report a measurement of the $B^0\\rightarrow\\psi(2S)\\pi^0$ branching\nfraction based on the full $\\Upsilon(4S)$ data set of $772\\times10^{6}$\n$B\\bar{B}$ pairs collected by the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy\n$e^+e^-$ collider. We obtain $B(B^0\\rightarrow\\psi(2S)\\pi^0) =\n(1.17\\pm0.17\\text{(stat)}\\pm0.08\\text{(syst)})\\times10^{-5}$. The result has a\nsignificance of 7.2 standard deviations and is the first observation of the\ndecay $B^0\\rightarrow\\psi(2S)\\pi^0$.\n", "  Based on 2.93 fb$^{-1}$ $e^+e^-$ collision data taken at center-of-mass\nenergy of 3.773 GeV by the BESIII detector, we report searches for the singly\nCabibbo-suppressed decays $D^{+}\\to\\omega\\pi^{+}$ and $D^{0}\\to\\omega\\pi^{0}$.\nA double tag technique is used to measure the absolute branching fractions\n$\\mathcal{B}(D^{+}\\to\\omega\\pi^{+})=(2.79\\pm0.57\\pm0.16)\\times 10^{-4}$ and\n$\\mathcal{B}(D^{0}\\to\\omega\\pi^{0})=(1.17\\pm0.34\\pm0.07)\\times 10^{-4}$, with\nstatistical significances of $5.5\\sigma$ and $4.1\\sigma$, respectively. We also\npresent measurements of the absolute branching fractions for the related $\\eta\n\\pi$ decay modes. We find\n$\\mathcal{B}(D^{+}\\to\\eta\\pi^{+})=(3.07\\pm0.22\\pm0.13)\\times10^{-3}$ and\n$\\mathcal{B}(D^{0}\\to\\eta\\pi^{0})=(0.65\\pm0.09\\pm0.04)\\times10^{-3}$, which are\nconsistent with the current world averages. The first and second uncertainties\nare statistical and systematic, respectively.\n", "  It is possible to employ virtual decay paths, including two-particle\ntransfer, to calculate the nuclear matrix element of neutrinoless double-beta\ndecay under the closure approximation, in addition to the true double-beta\npath. In the quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA) approach, it is\nnecessary to introduce the product wave functions of the like-particle and\nproton-neutron QRPA ground states, for achieving consistency between the\ncalculations of the true and virtual paths. Using these different paths, the\nproblem of whether or not these two methods give equivalent nuclear matrix\nelements (NME) is investigated. It is found that the two results are\ninequivalent, resulting from the different many-body correlations included in\nthe two QRPA methods, i.e., the use of the product wave functions alone is not\nsufficient. The author proposes introduction of the proton-neutron pairing\ninteraction with an adequate strength in the double-beta-path method, which\ncarries less many-body correlations without this supplemental interaction, for\nobtaining the NME equivalent to that of the two-particle-transfer-path method.\nThe validity of the proposed modified approach is examined.\n", "  The long time dynamics of large particles trapped in two inhomogeneous\nturbulent shear flows is studied experimentally. Both flows present a common\nfeature, a shear region that separates two colliding circulations, but with\ndifferent spatial symmetries and temporal behaviors. Because large particles\nare less and less sensitive to flow fluctuations as their size increases, we\nobserve the emergence of a slow dynamics corresponding to back-and-forth\nmotions between two attractors, and a super-slow regime synchronized with flow\nreversals when they exist. Such dynamics is substantially reproduced by a one\ndimensional stochastic model of an over-damped particle trapped in a two-well\npotential, forced by a colored noise. An extended model is also proposed that\nreproduces observed dynamics and trapping without potential barrier: the key\ningredient is the ratio between the time scales of the noise correlation and\nthe particle dynamics. A total agreement with experiments requires the\nintroduction of spatially inhomogeneous fluctuations and a suited confinement\nstrength.\n", "  Context. The seismology of early-type stars is limited by our incomplete\nunderstanding of gravito-inertial modes.\n  Aims. We develop a short-wavelength asymptotic analysis for gravito-inertial\nmodes in rotating stars.\n  Methods. The Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation was applied to the\nequations governing adiabatic small perturbations about a model of a uniformly\nrotating barotropic star.\n  Results. A general eikonal equation, including the effect of the centrifugal\ndeformation, is derived. The dynamics of axisymmetric gravito-inertial rays is\nsolved numerically for polytropic stellar models of increasing rotation and\nanalysed by describing the structure of the phase space. Three different types\nof phase-space structures are distinguished. The first type results from the\ncontinuous evolution of structures of the non-rotating integrable phase space.\nIt is predominant in the low-frequency part of the phase space. The second type\nof structures are island chains associated with stable periodic rays. The third\ntype of structures are large chaotic regions that can be related to the\nenvelope minimum of the Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequency.\n  Conclusions. Gravito-inertial modes are expected to follow this\nclassification, in which the frequency spectrum is a superposition of\nsub-spectra associated with these different types of phase-space structures.\nThe detailed confrontation between the predictions of this ray-based asymptotic\ntheory and numerically computed modes will be presented in a companion paper.\n", "  The matter bounce scenario allows for a sizable parameter space where\ncosmological fluctuations originally exited the Hubble radius when the\nbackground energy density was small. In this scenario and its extended\nversions, the low energy degrees of freedom are likely responsible for the\nstatistical properties of the cosmic microwave background power spectrum at\nlarge length scales. An interesting consequence is that these modes might be\nobservable only at relatively late times. Therefore low redshift observations\ncould provide evidence for, or even falsify, various bouncing models. We\nprovide an example where a recently hinted potential deviation from\n$\\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter cosmology results from a dark matter and dark energy\ninteraction. The same interaction allows matter bounce models to generate a red\ntilt for the primordial curvature perturbations in corroboration with cosmic\nmicrowave background experiments.\n", "  Great success has been achieved in improving the photovoltaic energy\nconversion efficiency of the organic-inorganic perovskite-based solar cells,\nbut with very limited knowledge on the thermal transport in hybrid perovskites,\nwhich would affect the device lifetime and stability. Based on the potential\ndeveloped from the density functional theory calculations, we studied the\nlattice thermal conductivity of the hybrid halide perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 using\nequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Temperature-dependent thermal\nconductivity is reported from 160 K to 400 K, which covers the tetragonal phase\n(160-330 K) and the pseudocubic phase (>330K). A very low thermal conductivity\n(0.50 W/mK) is found in the tetragonal phase at room temperature, whereas a\nmuch higher thermal conductivity is found in the pseudocubic phase (1.80 W/mK\nat 330 K). The low group velocity of acoustic phonons and the strong\nanharmonicity are found responsible for the relatively low thermal conductivity\nof the tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3.\n", "  For conventional materials, the thermal conductivity of thin film is usually\nsuppressed when the thickness decreases due to phonon-boundary scattering.\nHowever, this is not necessarily true for the van der Waals solids if the\nthickness is reduced to only a few layers. In this letter, the layer\nthickness-dependent phonon properties and thermal conductivity in the few-layer\nMoS2 are studied using the first-principles-based Peierls-Boltzmann transport\nequation approach. The basal-plane thermal conductivity is found to\nmonotonically reduce from 138 W/mK to 98 W/mK for naturally occurring MoS2, and\nfrom 155 W/mK to 115 W/mK for isotopically pure MoS2, when its thickness\nincreases from one layer to three layers. The thermal conductivity of tri-layer\nMoS2 approaches to that of bulk MoS2. Both the change of phonon dispersion and\nthe thickness-induced anharmonicity are important for explaining such a thermal\nconductivity reduction. The increased anharmonicity in bi-layer MoS2 results in\nstronger phonon scattering for ZAi modes, which is linked to the breakdown of\nthe symmetry in single-layer MoS2.\n", "  A comparison of simulation results with the prediction of the structural\nproperties of square-shoulder fluids is carried out to assess the performance\nof three theories: Tang--Lu's first-order mean spherical approximation, the\nsimplified exponential approximation of the latter and the rational-function\napproximation. These three theoretical developments share the characteristic of\nbeing analytical in Laplace space and of reducing in the proper limit to the\nPercus--Yevick result for the hard-sphere fluid. Overall, the best agreement\nwith the simulation data is obtained with the simplified exponential\napproximation.\n", "  In its three years of operation, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-III)\nApache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-1) observed\n$>$14,000 stars with enough epochs over a sufficient temporal baseline for the\nfitting of Keplerian orbits. We present the custom orbit-fitting pipeline used\nto create this catalog, which includes novel quality metrics that account for\nthe phase and velocity coverage of a fitted Keplerian orbit. With a typical RV\nprecision of $\\sim100-200$ m s$^{-1}$, APOGEE can probe systems with small\nseparation companions down to a few Jupiter masses. Here we present initial\nresults from a catalog of 382 of the most compelling stellar and substellar\ncompanion candidates detected by APOGEE, which orbit a variety of host stars in\ndiverse Galactic environments. Of these, 376 have no previously known small\nseparation companion. The distribution of companion candidates in this catalog\nshows evidence for an extremely truncated brown dwarf (BD) desert with a\npaucity of BD companions only for systems with $a < 0.1-0.2$ AU, with no\nindication of a desert at larger orbital separation. We propose a few potential\nexplanations of this result, some which invoke this catalog's many small\nseparation companion candidates found orbiting evolved stars. Furthermore, 16\nBD and planet candidates have been identified around metal-poor ([Fe/H] $<\n-0.5$) stars in this catalog, which may challenge the core accretion model for\ncompanions $>10 M_{Jup}$. Finally, we find all types of companions are\nubiquitous throughout the Galactic disk with candidate planetary-mass and BD\ncompanions to distances of $\\sim6$ and $\\sim16$ kpc, respectively.\n", "  In the course of the MUCHFUSS project we have recently discovered four radial\nvelocity (RV) variable, hot (Teff $\\approx$ 80,000 - 110,000 K) post-asymptotic\ngiant branch (AGB) stars. Among them, we found the first known RV variable\nO(He) star, the only second known RV variable PG 1159 close binary candidate,\nas well as the first two naked (i.e., without planetary nebula (PN)) H-rich\npost-AGB stars of spectral type O(H) that show significant RV variations. We\npresent a non-LTE spectral analysis of these stars along with one further\nO(H)-type star whose RV variations were found to be not significant. We also\nreport the discovery of an far-infrared excess in the case of the PG 1159 star.\nNone of the stars in our sample displays nebular emission lines, which can be\nexplained well in terms of a very late thermal pulse evolution in the case of\nthe PG 1159 star. The \"missing\" PNe around the O(H)-type stars seem strange,\nsince we find that several central stars of PNe have much longer post-AGB\ntimes. Besides the non-ejection of a PN, the occurrence of a late thermal\npulse, or the re-accretion of the PN in the previous post-AGB evolution offer\npossible explanations for those stars not harbouring a PN (anymore). In case of\nthe O(He) star J0757 we speculate that it might have been previously part of a\ncompact He transferring binary system. In this scenario, the mass transfer must\nhave stopped after a certain time, leaving behind a low mass close companion\nthat could be responsible for the extreme RV shift of 107.0 $\\pm$ 22.0 km/s\nmeasured within only 31 min.\n", "  A wealth of X-ray and radio observations has revealed in the past decade a\ngrowing diversity of neutron stars (NSs) with properties spanning orders of\nmagnitude in magnetic field strength and ages, and with emission processes\nexplained by a range of mechanisms dictating their radiation properties.\nHowever, serious difficulties exist with the magneto-dipole model of isolated\nneutron star fields and their inferred ages, such as a large range of observed\nbraking indices ($n$, with values often $<$3) and a mismatch between the\nneutron star and associated supernova remnant (SNR) ages. This problem arises\nprimarily from the assumptions of a constant magnetic field with $n$=3, and an\ninitial spin period that is much smaller than the observed current period. It\nhas been suggested that a solution to this problem involves magnetic field\nevolution, with some NSs having magnetic fields buried within the crust by\naccretion of fall-back supernova material following their birth. In this work\nwe explore a parametric phenomenological model for magnetic field growth that\ngeneralizes previous suggested field evolution functions, and apply it to a\nvariety of NSs with both secure SNR associations and known ages. We explore the\nflexibility of the model by recovering the results of previous work on buried\nmagnetic fields in young neutron stars. Our model fits suggest that apparently\ndisparate classes of NSs may be related to one another through the\ntime-evolution of the magnetic field.\n", "  We have studied the dynamical polarization and collective excitations in an\nanisotropic two-dimensional system undergoing a quantum phase transition with\nmerging of two Dirac points. Analytical results for the one-loop polarization\nfunction are obtained at the finite momentum, frequency, and chemical\npotential. The evolution of the plasmon dispersion across the phase transition\nis then analyzed within the random phase approximation. We derive analytically\nthe long-wavelength dispersion of the undamped anisotropic collective mode and\nfind that it evolves smoothly at the critical merging point. The effects of the\nvan Hove singularity on the plasmon excitations are explored in detail.\n", "  We present tables for the bound-state energies for atomic hydrogen. The\ntabulated energies include the hyperfine structure, and thus this work extends\nthe work of Rev. Mod. Phys. {\\bf 84}, 1527 (2012), which excludes hyperfine\nstructure. The tabulation includes corrections of the hyperfine structure due\nto the anomalous moment of the electron, due to the finite mass of the proton,\nand due to off-diagonal matrix elements of the hyperfine Hamiltonian. These\ncorrections are treated incorrectly in most other works. Simple formulas valid\nfor all quantum numbers are presented for the hyperfine corrections. The\ntabulated energies have uncertainties of less than 1 kHz for all states. This\naccuracy is possible because of the recent precision measurement [Nature, {\\bf\n466}, 213 (2010); Science, {\\bf 339}, 417] of the proton radius. The effect of\nthis new radius on the energy levels is also tabulated, and the energies are\ncompared to precision measurements of atomic hydrogen energy intervals.\n", "  Two categories of results regarding quantum measurements are derived in this\nwork and applied to the problem of collapse. The first category is concerned\nwith local and transient features of the entanglement between a macroscopic\nmeasuring system and a measured one. These properties result directly from the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. They cannot be formulated in terms of observables, do\nnot affect the wave functions themselves but express their history in an\nirreversible way. They carry a specific new kind of local probabilities, which\nevolve with a finite velocity under nonlinear wave equations. The second\ncategory of results extends these local properties to the case of a macroscopic\nsystem and its environment. Fluctuations in their interaction are predicted\nthen and generate a specific incoherence in the quantum state of the system.\nThese two kinds of effects act together when a macroscopic measuring system\ninteracts with a measured system and with an environment. Their combination\nyields then an explicit and effective mechanism of collapse, with a random\nbehavior resulting from random incoherence. Born's basic probability rule for\nthe results of measurements turns out then simply a consequence of quantum\ndynamics. Some conjectures still enter into the derivation of these effects,\nwhich one may recognize to look hardly credible at first sight. They fit\nhowever so well together that one proposes a more thorough investigation of\ntheir approach as a promising strategy for a self-contained explanation of\ncollapse.\n", "  We report on a study of Seebeck coefficient and resistivity in the\nquasi-one-dimensional conductor (TMTSF)$_{2}$PF$_{6}$ extended deep into the\nSpin-Density-Wave(SDW) state. The metal-insulator transition at $T_{SDW}$ = 12\nK leads to a reduction in carrier concentration by seven orders of magnitude.\nBelow 1 K, charge transport displays the behavior known as Variable Range\nHopping (VRH). Until now, the Seebeck response of electrons in this regime has\nbeen barely explored and even less understood. We find that in this system,\nresidual carriers, hopping from one trap to another, generate a Seebeck\ncoefficient as large as 400 $k_{B}$/$e$. The results provide the first solid\nevidence for a long-standing prediction according to which hopping electrons in\npresence of Coulomb interaction can generate a sizeable Seebeck coefficient in\nthe zero-temperature limit.\n", "  A large dataset of ~2800 spectra extracted from the ELODIE archive was\nanalysed in order to find solar twins. A list of stellar spectra closely\nresembling the spectrum of the Sun was selected by applying a purely\ndifferential method, directly on the fluxes. As solar reference, 18 spectra of\nasteroids, Moon and blue sky were used. Atmospheric parameters and differential\nabundances of 8 chemical elements were determined for the solar twin\ncandidates, after a careful selection of appropriate lines. The Li feature of\nthe targets was investigated and additional information on absolute magnitude\nand age was gathered from the literature. HIP076114 (HD138573) is our best twin\ncandidate, looking exactly like the Sun in all these properties.\n", "  The recent unexpected detection of terrestrial complex organic molecules in\nthe cold (~ 10 K) gas has cast doubts on the commonly accepted formation\nmechanisms of these species. Standard gas-phase mechanisms are inefficient and\ntend to underproduce these molecules, and many of the key reactions involved\nare unconstrained. Grain-surface mechanisms, which were presented as a viable\nalternative, suffer from the fact that they rely on grain surface diffusion of\nheavy radicals, which is not possible thermally at very low temperatures. One\nof the simplest terrestrial complex organic molecules, methanol is believed to\nform on cold grain surfaces following from successive H atom additions on CO.\nUnlike heavier species, H atoms are very mobile on grain surfaces even at 10 K.\nIntermediate species involved in grain surface methanol formation by CO\nhydrogenation are the radicals HCO and CH3O, as well as the stable species\nformaldehyde H2CO. These radicals are thought to be precursors of complex\norganic molecules on grain surfaces. We present new observations of the HCO and\nCH3O radicals in a sample of prestellar cores and carry out an analysis of the\nabundances of the species HCO, H2CO, CH3O, and CH3OH, which represent the\nvarious stages of grain-surface hydrogenation of CO to CH3OH. The abundance\nratios between the various intermediate species in the hydrogenation reaction\nof CO on grains are similar in all sources of our sample, HCO:H2CO:CH3O:CH3OH ~\n10:100:1:100. We argue that these ratios may not be representative of the\nprimordial abundances on the grains but, rather, suggest that the radicals HCO\nand CH3O are gas-phase products of the precursors H2CO and CH3OH, respectively.\nGas-phase pathways are considered and simple estimates of HCO and CH3O\nabundances are compared to the observations. Critical reaction rate constants,\nbranching ratios, and intermediate species are finally identified.\n", "  We study the predicted rotational evolution of solar-type stars from the\npre-main sequence to the solar age with 1D rotating evolutionary models\nincluding physical ingredients. We computed rotating evolution models of\nsolar-type stars including an external stellar wind torque and internal\ntransport of angular momentum following the method of Maeder and Zahn with the\ncode STAREVOL. We explored different formalisms and prescriptions available\nfrom the literature. We tested the predictions of the models against recent\nrotational period data from extensive photometric surveys, lithium abundances\nof solar-mass stars in young clusters, and the helioseismic rotation profile of\nthe Sun. We find a best-matching combination of prescriptions for both internal\ntransport and surface extraction of angular momentum. This combination provides\na very good fit to the observed evolution of rotational periods for solar-type\nstars from early evolution to the age of the Sun. Additionally, we show that\nfast rotators experience a stronger coupling between their radiative region and\nthe convective envelope. Regardless of the set of prescriptions, however, we\ncannot simultaneously reproduce surface angular velocity and the internal\nprofile of the Sun or the evolution of lithium abundance. We confirm the idea\nthat additional transport mechanisms must occur in solar-type stars until they\nreach the age of the Sun. Whether these processes are the same as those needed\nto explain recent asteroseismic data in more advanced evolutionary phases is\nstill an open question.\n", "  We present the results of 2D and 3D hydrodynamic simulations of idealized\nprotoplanetary discs that examine the formation and evolution of vortices by\nthe vertical shear instability (VSI). In agreement with recent work, we find\nthat discs with radially decreasing temperature profiles and short thermal\nrelaxation time-scales, are subject to the axisymmetric VSI. In three\ndimensions, the resulting velocity perturbations give rise to\nquasi-axisymmetric potential vorticity perturbations that break-up into\ndiscrete vortices, in a manner that is reminiscent of the Rossby wave\ninstability. Discs with very short thermal evolution time-scales (i.e.\n{\\tau}<0.1 local orbit periods) develop strong vorticity perturbations that\nroll up into vortices that have small aspect ratios ({\\chi}<2) and short\nlifetimes (~ a few orbits). Longer thermal time-scales give rise to vortices\nwith larger aspect ratios (6<{\\chi}<10), and lifetimes that depend on the\nentropy gradient. A steeply decreasing entropy profile leads to vortex\nlifetimes that exceed the simulation run times of hundreds of orbital periods.\nVortex lifetimes in discs with positive or weakly decreasing entropy profiles\nare much shorter, being 10s of orbits at most, suggesting that the subcritical\nbaroclinic instability plays an important role in sustaining vortices against\ndestruction through the elliptical instability. Applied to the outer regions of\nprotoplanetary discs, where the VSI is most likely to occur, our results\nsuggest that vortices formed by the VSI are likely to be short lived\nstructures.\n", "  We solved the radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium equations in a\ntwo-dimensional cross-section of a cylindrical structure oriented horizontally\nand lying above the solar surface. The cylinder is filled with a mixture of\nhydrogen and helium and is illuminated at a given altitude from the solar disc.\nWe constructed simple models made from a single thread or from an ensemble of\nseveral threads along the line of sight. This first use of two-dimensional,\nmulti-thread fine structure modelling combining hydrogen and helium radiative\ntransfer allowed us to compute synthetic emergent spectra from cylindrical\nstructures and to study the effect of line-of-sight integration of an ensemble\nof threads under a range of physical conditions. We analysed the effects of\nvariations in temperature distribution and in gas pressure. We considered the\neffect of multi-thread structures within a given field of view and the effect\nof peculiar velocities between the structures in a multi-thread model. We\ncompared these new models to the single thread model and tested them with\nvarying parameters. These new computations show, for the first time, the effect\nof integrating the radiation emitted in H and He lines by several cylindrical\nthreads that are static or moving along the line of sight. They can be used to\ninterpret high-spatial and spectral resolutions of cylindrical structures found\nin the solar atmosphere, such as cool coronal loops or prominence threads.\n", "  The need for the development of automatic tools to explore astronomical\ndatabases has been recognized since the inception of CCDs and modern computers.\nAstronomers already have developed solutions to tackle several science\nproblems, such as automatic classification of stellar objects, outlier\ndetection, and globular clusters identification, among others. New science\nproblems emerge and it is critical to be able to re-use the models learned\nbefore, without rebuilding everything from the beginning when the science\nproblem changes. In this paper, we propose a new meta-model that automatically\nintegrates existing classification models of variable stars. The proposed\nmeta-model incorporates existing models that are trained in a different\ncontext, answering different questions and using different representations of\ndata. Conventional mixture of experts algorithms in machine learning literature\ncan not be used since each expert (model) uses different inputs. We also\nconsider computational complexity of the model by using the most expensive\nmodels only when it is necessary. We test our model with EROS-2 and MACHO\ndatasets, and we show that we solve most of the classification challenges only\nby training a meta-model to learn how to integrate the previous experts.\n", "  Methanol masers at 6.7 GHz are well known tracers of high-mass star-forming\nregions. However, their origin is still not clearly understood. We aimed to\ndetermine the morphology and velocity structure for a large sample of the maser\nemission with generally lower peak flux densities than those in previous\nsurveys. Using the European VLBI Network we imaged the remaining sources (17)\nfrom a sample of sources that were selected from the unbiased survey using the\nTorun 32 m dish. Together they form a database of a total of 63 source images\nwith high sensitivity, milliarcsecond angular resolution and very good spectral\nresolution for detailed studies. We studied in detail the properties of the\nmaser clouds and calculated the mean and median values of the projected size\n(17.4 au and 5.5 au, respectively) as well as the FWHM of the line (0.373 km\ns$^{-1}$ and 0.315 km s$^{-1}$ for the mean and median values, respectively),\ntesting whether it was consistent with Gaussian profile. We also found maser\nclouds with velocity gradients (71 per cent) that ranged from 0.005 km s$^{-1}$\nau$^{-1}$ to 0.210 km s$^{-1}$ au$^{-1}$. We tested the kinematic models to\nexplain the observed structures of the 6.7 GHz emission. There were targets\nwhere the morphology supported the scenario of a rotating and expanding disk or\na bipolar outflow. Comparing the interferometric and single-dish spectra we\nfound that, typically, 50-70 per cent of the flux was missing. This phenomena\nis not strongly related to the distance of the source. The EVN imaging reveals\nthat in the complete sample of 63 sources the ring-like morphology appeared in\n17 per cent of sources, arcs were seen in a further 8 per cent, and the\nstructures were complex in 46 per cent cases. The UC HII regions coincide in\nposition in the sky for 13 per cent of the sources. They are related both to\nextremely high and low luminosity masers from the sample.\n", "  In the present paper we argue that the correction to the Higgs mass coming\nfrom the bound state of 6 top and 6 anti-top quarks, predicted early by C.D.\nFroggatt and ourselves, leads to the Standard Model vacuum stability and\nconfirms the accuracy of the multiple point principle (principle of degenerate\nvacua) for all experimentally valued parameters (Higgs mass, top-quark mass,\netc.). Fitting to get the vacuum degeneracy requires a mass of the bound state,\njust in the region of the new two photon state in LHC, 750-760 GeV.\n", "  Recent massive sky surveys in different bandwidths are providing new\nopportunities to modern astronomy. The Virtual Observatory (VO) represents the\nadequate framework to handle the huge amount of information available and\nfilter out data according to specific requirements.\n  In this work, we applied a selection strategy to find new, uncatalogued hot\nsubdwarfs making use of VO tools. We used large area catalogues (GALEX, SDSS,\nSuperCosmos, 2MASS) to retrieve photometric and astrometric information of\nstellar objects. To these objects, we applied colour and proper motion filters,\ntogether with an effective temperature cutoff, aimed at separating hot\nsubdwarfs from other blue objects such as white dwarfs, cataclysmic variables\nor main sequence OB stars. As a result, we obtained 437 new, uncatalogued hot\nsubdwarf candidates. Based on previous results, we expect our procedure to have\nan overall efficiency of at least 80 per cent. Visual inspection of the 68\ncandidates with SDSS spectrum showed that 65 can be classified as hot\nsubdwarfs: 5 sdOs, 25 sdOBs and 35 sdBs. This success rate above 95 per cent\nproves the robustness and efficiency of our methodology.\n  The spectral energy distribution of 45 per cent of the subdwarf candidates\nshowed infrared excesses, a signature of their probable binary nature. The\nstellar companions of the binary systems so detected are expected to be\nlate-type main sequence stars. A detailed determination of temperatures and\nspectral classification of the cool companions will be presented in a\nforthcoming work.\n", "  Context. Luminous blue variables (LBVs) are rare massive stars with very high\nluminosity. They are characterized by strong photo-metric and spectroscopic\nvariability related to transient eruptions. The mechanisms at the origin of\nthese eruptions is not well known. In addition, their formation is still\nproblematic and the presence of a companion could help to explain how they\nform. Aims. This article presents a study of seven LBVs (about 20% of the known\nGalactic population), some Wolf-Rayet stars, and massive binaries. We probe the\nenvironments that surround these massive stars with near-, mid-, and\nfar-infrared images, investigating potential nebula/shells and the companion\nstars. Methods. To investigate large spatial scales, we used seeing-limited and\nnear diffraction-limited adaptive optics images to obtain a differential\ndiagnostic on the presence of circumstellar matter and to determine their\nextent. From those images, we also looked for the presence of binary companions\non a wide orbit. Once a companion was detected, its gravitational binding to\nthe central star was tested. Tests include the chance projection probability,\nthe proper motion estimates with multi-epoch observations, flux ratio, and star\nseparations. Results. We find that two out of seven of LBVs may have a wide\norbit companion. Most of the LBVs display a large circumstellar envelope or\nseveral shells. In particular, HD168625, known for its rings, possesses several\nshells with possibly a large cold shell at the edge of which the rings are\nformed. For the first time, we have directly imaged the companion of LBV stars.\n", "  We examine the validity of the generalized factorization method and calculate\nthe angular correlations in the charmful three-body baryonic decays of $\\bar\nB^0\\to \\Lambda \\bar p D^{(*)+}$. With the timelike baryonic form factors newly\nextracted from the measured baryonic $B$ decays, we obtain ${\\cal B}(\\bar\nB^0\\to \\Lambda \\bar p D^+,\\Lambda \\bar p D^{*+})=(1.85\\pm 0.30,2.75\\pm\n0.24)\\times 10^{-5}$ to agree with the recent data from the BELLE\nCollaboration, which demonstrates that the theoretical approach based on the\nfactorization still works well. For the angular distribution asymmetries, we\nfind ${\\cal A}_{\\theta}(\\bar B^0\\to \\Lambda \\bar p D^+,\\Lambda\\bar p\nD^{*+})=(-0.030\\pm 0.002\\,,+0.150\\pm 0.000)$, which are consistent with the\ncurrent measurements. Moreover, we predict that ${\\cal A}_\\theta(\\bar B^0\\to\np\\bar p D^{0},p\\bar p D^{*0})=+0.04\\pm 0.01$. Future precise explorations of\nthese angular correlations at BELLE and LHCb as well as super-BELLE are\nimportant to justify the present factorization approach in the charmful\nthree-body baryonic decays.\n", "  We consider a mean-field model of coupled phase oscillators with quenched\ndisorder in the coupling strengths and natural frequencies. When these two\nkinds of disorder are uncorrelated (and when the positive and negative\ncouplings are equal in number and strength), it is known that phase coherence\ncannot occur and synchronization is absent. Here we explore the effects of\ncorrelating the disorder. Specifically, we assume that any given oscillator\neither attracts or repels all the others, and that the sign of the interaction\nis deterministically correlated with the given oscillator's natural frequency.\nFor symmetrically correlated disorder with zero mean, we find that the system\nspontaneously synchronizes, once the width of the frequency distribution falls\nbelow a critical value. For asymmetrically correlated disorder, the model\ndisplays coherent traveling waves: the complex order parameter becomes nonzero\nand rotates with constant frequency different from the system's mean natural\nfrequency. Thus, in both cases, correlated disorder can trigger phase\ncoherence.\n", "  The high density of evanescent modes in the vicinity of a metal leads to\nenhancement of the near-field F\\\"{o}rster resonant energy transfer (FRET) rate.\nWe present a classical approach to calculate the FRET rate based on the dyadic\nGreen's function of an arbitrary dielectric environment, and consider non-local\nlimit of material permittivity in case of metallic halfspace and thin film. In\na dimer system, we find that the FRET rate is enhanced due to shared evanescent\nphoton modes bridging a donor and an acceptor. Furthermore, a general\nexpression for the FRET rate for multimer systems is derived. The presence of a\ndielectric environment and the path interference effect enhance the transfer\nrate, depending on the combination of distance and geometry.\n", "  Aims. The main-sequence B-type star $\\zeta$ Cassiopeiae is known as a N-rich\nstar with a magnetic field discovered with the Musicos spectropolarimeter. We\nmodel the magnetic field of the star by means of 82 new spectropolarimetric\nobservations of higher precision to investigate the field strength, topology,\nand effect.\n  Methods. We gathered data with the Narval spectropolarimeter installed at\nT\\'elescope Bernard Lyot (TBL, Pic du Midi, France) and applied the\nleast-squares deconvolution technique to measure the circular polarisation of\nthe light emitted from $\\zeta$ Cas. We used a dipole oblique rotator model to\ndetermine the field configuration by fitting the longitudinal field\nmeasurements and by synthesizing the measured Stokes V profiles. We also made\nuse of the Zeeman-Doppler Imaging technique to map the stellar surface and to\ndeduce the difference in rotation rate between the pole and equator.\n  Results. $\\zeta$ Cas exhibits a polar field strength $B_{\\rm pol}$ of 100-150\nG, which is the weakest polar field observed so far in a massive main-sequence\nstar. Surface differential rotation is ruled out by our observations and the\nfield of $\\zeta$ Cas is strong enough to enforce rigid internal rotation in the\nradiative zone according to theory. Thus, the star rotates as a solid body in\nthe envelope.\n  Conclusions. We therefore exclude rotationally-induced mixing as the cause of\nthe surface N-enrichment. We discuss that the transport of chemicals from the\ncore to the surface by internal gravity waves is the most plausible explanation\nfor the nitrogen overabundance at the surface of $\\zeta$ Cas.\n", "  Online social networks offer a new way to investigate financial markets'\ndynamics by enabling the large-scale analysis of investors' collective\nbehavior. We provide empirical evidence that suggests social media and stock\nmarkets have a nonlinear causal relationship. We take advantage of an extensive\ndata set composed of social media messages related to DJIA index components. By\nusing information-theoretic measures to cope for possible nonlinear causal\ncoupling between social media and stock markets systems, we point out stunning\ndifferences in the results with respect to linear coupling. Two main\nconclusions are drawn: First, social media significant causality on stocks'\nreturns are purely nonlinear in most cases; Second, social media dominates the\ndirectional coupling with stock market, an effect not observable within linear\nmodeling. Results also serve as empirical guidance on model adequacy in the\ninvestigation of sociotechnical and financial systems.\n", "  The distance to pulsating stars is classically estimated using the\nparallax-of-pulsation (PoP) method, which combines spectroscopic radial\nvelocity measurements and angular diameter estimates to derive the distance of\nthe star. An important application of this method is the determination of\nCepheid distances, in view of the calibration of their distance scale. However,\nthe conversion of radial to pulsational velocities in the PoP method relies on\na poorly calibrated parameter, the projection factor (p-factor). We aim to\nmeasure empirically the value of the p-factors of a homogeneous sample of nine\nGalactic Cepheids for which trigonometric parallaxes were measured with the\nHubble Space Telescope Fine Guidance Sensor. We use the SPIPS algorithm, a\nrobust implementation of the PoP method that combines photometry,\ninterferometry, and radial velocity measurements in a global modeling of the\npulsation. We obtained new interferometric angular diameters using the PIONIER\ninstrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer, completed by data from\nthe literature. Using the known distance as an input, we derive the value of\nthe p-factor and study its dependence with the pulsation period. We find the\nfollowing p-factors: 1.20 $\\pm$ 0.12 for RT Aur, 1.48 $\\pm$ 0.18 for T Vul,\n1.14 $\\pm$ 0.10 for FF Aql, 1.31 $\\pm$ 0.19 for Y Sgr, 1.39 $\\pm$ 0.09 for X\nSgr, 1.35 $\\pm$ 0.13 for W Sgr, 1.36 $\\pm$ 0.08 for $\\beta$ Dor, 1.41 $\\pm$\n0.10 for $\\zeta$ Gem, and 1.23 $\\pm$ 0.12 for $\\ell$ Car. These values are\nconsistently close to p = 1.324 $\\pm$ 0.024. We observe some dispersion around\nthis average value, but the observed distribution is statistically consistent\nwith a constant value of the p-factor as a function of the pulsation period.\nThe error budget of our determination of the p-factor values is presently\ndominated by the uncertainty on the parallax, a limitation that will soon be\nwaived by Gaia.\n", "  We study the effect of disorder on spectral properties of tubular chlorosomes\nin green sulfur bacteria Cf. aurantiacus. Employing a Frenkel-exciton\nHamiltonian with diagonal and off-diagonal disorder consistent with spectral\nand structural studies, we analyze excitonic localization and spectral\nstatistics of the chlorosomes. A size-dependent localization-delocalization\ncrossover is found to occur as a function of the excitonic energy. The\ncrossover energy region coincides with the more optically active states with\nmaximized superradiance, and is, consequently, more conducive for energy\ntransfer.\n", "  We investigate a fluid description of inflationary cosmology. It is shown\nthat the three observables of the inflationary universe: the spectral index of\nthe curvature perturbations, the tensor-to-scalar ratio of the density\nperturbations, and the running of the spectral index, can be compatible with\nthe Planck analysis. In addition, we reconstruct the equation of state (EoS)\nfor a fluid from the spectral index of the curvature perturbations consistent\nwith the Planck results. We explicitly demonstrate that the universe can\ngracefully exit from inflation in the reconstructed fluid models. Furthermore,\nwe explore the singular inflation for a fluid model.\n", "  This is a status report on a companion subject to extremal combinatorics,\nobtained by replacing extremality properties with emergent structure, `phases'.\nWe discuss phases, and phase transitions, in large graphs and large\npermutations, motivating and using the asymptotic formalisms of graphons for\ngraphs and permutons for permutations. Phase structure is shown to emerge using\nentropy and large deviation techniques.\n", "  The search for half-metals and spin-gapless semiconductors has attracted\nextensive attention in material design for spintronics. Existing progress in\nsuch a search often requires peculiar atomistic lattice configuration and also\nlacks active control of the resulting electronic properties. Here we reveal\nthat a boron-nitride nanoribbon with a carbon-doped edge can be made a\nhalf-metal or a spin-gapless semiconductor in a programmable fashion. The\nmechanical strain serves as the on/off switches for functions of half-metal and\nspin-gapless semiconductor to occur. Our findings shed light on how the edge\ndoping combined with strain engineering can affect electronic properties of\ntwo-dimensional materials\n", "  We present a detailed NIR/optical/UV study of the transient low mass X-ray\nbinary 1RXS J180408.9-342058 performed during its 2015 outburst, aimed at\ndetermining the nature of its companion star. We obtained three optical spectra\nat the 2.1 m San Pedro Martir Observatory telescope (Mexico). We performed\noptical and NIR photometric observations with both the REM telescope and the\nNew Technology Telescope (NTT) in La Silla. We obtained optical and UV\nobservations from the Swift archive. Finally, we performed optical polarimetry\nof the source by using the EFOSC2 instrument mounted on the NTT. The optical\nspectrum of the source is almost featureless since the hydrogen and He I\nemissions lines, typically observed in LMXBs, are not detected. Similarly,\ncarbon and oxygen lines are neither observed. We marginally detect the He II\n4686 AA emission line, suggesting the presence of helium in the accretion disc.\nNo significant optical polarisation level was observed. The lack of hydrogen\nand He I emission lines in the spectrum implies that the companion is likely\nnot a main sequence star. Driven by the tentative detection of the He II 4686\nAA emission line, we suggest that the system could harbour a helium white\ndwarf. If this is the case, 1RXS J180408.9-342058 would be an ultra-compact\nX-ray binary. By combining an estimate of the mass accretion rate together with\nevolutionary tracks for a He white dwarf, we obtain a tentative orbital period\nof ~ 40 min. On the other hand, we also built the NIR-optical-UV spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) of the source at two different epochs. One SED was\ngathered when the source was in the soft X-ray state, and it is consistent with\nthe presence of a single thermal component. The second SED, obtained when the\nsource was in the hard X-ray state, shows a thermal component together with a\ntail in the NIR, likely indicating the presence of a (transient) jet.\n", "  Using the Southern Proper Motion (SPM) catalog, we show that the candidate\nThorne-\\.Zytkow object HV~2112 has a proper motion implying a space velocity of\nabout 3000\\kms if the object is located at the distance of the Small Magellanic\nCloud. The proper motion is statistically different from that of the SMC at\napproximately $4\\sigma$ in SPM, although the result can drop to about $3\\sigma$\nsignificance by including the UCAC4 data and considering systematic\nuncertainties in addition to the statistical ones. Assuming the measurement is\nrobust, this proper motion is sufficient to exclude its proposed membership of\nthe Small Magellanic Cloud and to argue instead that it is likely to be a\nforeground star in the Milky Way halo. The smaller distance and therefore lower\nbrightness argue against its proposed nature as a Thorne-\\.Zytkow object (the\nhypothesized star-like object formed when a normal star and a neutron star\nmerge) or a super-Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star. Instead we propose a\nbinary scenario where this star is the companion of a former massive AGB star,\nwhich polluted the object with via its stellar wind, i.e. a special case of an\nextrinsic S star. Our new scenario solves two additional problems with the two\nexisting scenarios for its nature as Thorne-\\.Zytkow object or present-day\nsuper-AGB star. The puzzling high ratio of the strength of calcium to iron\nabsorption lines is unexpected for SMC supergiants, but is fully consistent\nwith the expectations for halo abundances. Secondly, its strong variability can\nnow be explained naturally as a manifestation of the Mira phenomenon.\n", "  We study the world-volume effective action of an exotic five-brane, known as\nthe M-theory 5${}^3$-brane (M5${}^3$-brane) in eleven dimensions. The\nsupermultiplet of the world-volume theory is the $\\mathcal{N} = (2, 0)$ tensor\nmultiplet in six dimensions. The world-volume action contains three Killing\nvectors $\\hat{k}_{\\hat{I}} {}^M \\ (\\hat{I} =1,2,3)$ associated with the\n$U(1)^3$ isometry. We find the effective T-duality rule for the\neleven-dimensional backgrounds that transforms the M5-brane effective action to\nthat of the M5${}^3$-brane. We also show that our action provides the source\nterm for the M5${}^3$-brane geometry in eleven-dimensional supergravity\n", "  Stellar radial velocities play a fundamental role in the discovery of\nextrasolar planets and the measurement of their physical parameters as well as\nin the study of stellar physical properties. We investigate the impact of the\nsolar activity on the radial velocity of the Sun using the HARPS spectrograph\nto obtain measurements that can be directly compared with those acquired in the\nextrasolar planet search programs. We use the Moon, the Galilean satellites,\nand several asteroids as reflectors to measure the radial velocity of the Sun\nas a star and correlate it with disc-integrated chromospheric and magnetic\nindexes of solar activity that are similar to stellar activity indexes. We\ndiscuss in detail the systematic effects that affect our measurements and the\nmethods to account for them. We find that the radial velocity of the Sun as a\nstar is positively correlated with the level of its chromospheric activity at\nabout 95 percent significance level. The amplitude of the long-term variation\nmeasured in the 2006-2014 period is 4.98 \\pm 1.44 m/s, in good agreement with\nmodel predictions. The standard deviation of the residuals obtained by\nsubtracting a linear best fit is 2.82 m/s and is due to the rotation of the\nreflecting bodies and the intrinsic variability of the Sun on timescales\nshorter than the activity cycle. A correlation with a lower significance is\ndetected between the radial velocity and the mean absolute value of the\nline-of-sight photospheric magnetic field flux density. Our results confirm\nsimilar correlations found in other late-type main-sequence stars and provide\nsupport to the predictions of radial velocity variations induced by stellar\nactivity based on current models.\n", "  Comets are remnants of the icy planetesimals that formed beyond the ice line\nin the Solar Nebula. Growing from micrometre-sized dust and ice particles to\nkm-sized objects is, however, difficult because of growth barriers and time\nscale constraints. The gravitational collapse of pebble clouds that formed\nthrough the streaming instability may provide a suitable mechanism for comet\nformation.\n  We study the collisional compression of cm-sized porous ice/dust-mixed\npebbles in collapsing pebble clouds. For this, we developed a collision model\nfor pebbles consisting of a mixture of ice and dust, characterised by their\ndust-to-ice mass ratio. Using the final compression of the pebbles, we\nconstrain combinations of initial cloud mass, initial pepple porosity, and\ndust-to-ice ratio that lead to cometesimals which are consistent with observed\nbulk properties of cometary nuclei.\n  We find that observed high porosity and low density of ~0.5 g/cc of comet\nnuclei can only be explained if comets formed in clouds with mass approximately\nM>1e18 g. Lower mass clouds would only work if the pebbles were initially very\ncompact. Furthermore, the dust-to-ice ratio must be in the range of between 3\nand 9 to match the observed bulk properties of comet nuclei. (abridged version)\n", "  Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) represent nearly half of the more than 160\ncurrently known $\\gamma$-ray pulsars detected by the Large Area Telescope on\nthe \\textit{Fermi} satellite, and a third of all known MSPs are seen in\n$\\gamma$ rays. The least energetic $\\gamma$-ray MSPs enable us to probe the\nso-called deathline for high-energy emission, i.e., the spin-down luminosity\nlimit under which pulsars (PSRs) cease to produce detectable high-energy\nradiation. Characterizing the MSP luminosity distribution helps to determine\ntheir contribution to the Galactic diffuse $\\gamma$-ray emission. We made use\nof the high-quality pulsar timing data recorded at the Nan\\c{c}ay Radio\nTelescope over several years to characterize the properties of a selection of\nMSPs. For one of the pulsars, the dataset was complemented with Westerbork\nSynthesis Radio Telescope observations. The rotation ephemerides derived from\nthis analysis were also used to search the LAT data for new $\\gamma$-ray MSPs.\nFor the MSPs considered in this study, we obtained new transverse proper motion\nmeasurements or updated the existing ones, and placed new distance constraints\nfor some of them, with four new timing parallax measurements. We discovered\nsignificant GeV $\\gamma$-ray signals from four MSPs, i.e., PSRs J0740+6620,\nJ0931$-$1902, J1455$-$3330, and J1730$-$2304. The latter is now the least\nenergetic $\\gamma$-ray pulsar found to date. Despite the improved $\\dot E$ and\n$L_\\gamma$ estimates, the relationship between these two quantities remains\nunclear, especially at low $\\dot E$ values.\n", "  The Green function (GF) method is used to analyze the boundary effects\nproduced by a Chern Simons (CS) extension to electrodynamics. We consider the\nelectromagnetic field coupled to a $\\theta$ term that is piecewise constant in\ndifferent regions of space, separated by a common interface $\\Sigma$, the\n$\\theta$ boundary, model which we will refer to as $\\theta$ electrodynamics\n($\\theta$ ED). This model provides a correct low energy effective action for\ndescribing topological insulators (TI). In this work we construct the static GF\nin $\\theta$ ED for different geometrical configurations of the $\\theta$\nboundary, namely: planar, spherical and cylindrical $\\theta$ interfaces. Also\nwe adapt the standard Green theorem to include the effects of the $\\theta$\nboundary. These are the most important results of our work, since they allow to\nobtain the corresponding static electric and magnetic fields for arbitrary\nsources and arbitrary boundary conditions in the given geometries. Also, the\nmethod provides a well defined starting point for either analytical or\nnumerical approximations in the cases where the exact analytical calculations\nare not possible. Explicit solutions for simple cases in each of the\naforementioned geometries for $\\theta$ boundaries are provided. The adapted\nGreen theorem is illustrated by studying the problem of a point like electric\ncharge interacting with a planar TI with prescribed boundary conditions. Our\ngeneralization, when particularized to specific cases, is successfully compared\nwith previously reported results, most of which have been obtained by using the\nmethods of images.\n", "  We present $Spitzer$ IRAC mid-infrared point source catalogs for mosaics\ncovering the fields of the nearby ($\\lesssim$4 Mpc) galaxies NGC 55, NGC 253,\nNGC 2366, NGC 4214, and NGC 5253. We detect a total of 20159 sources in these\nfive fields. Point spread function photometry was performed on sources detected\nin both $Spitzer$ IRAC 3.6 $\\mu$m and 4.5 $\\mu$m bands at greater than\n3$\\sigma$ above background. These data were then supplemented by aperture\nphotometry in the IRAC 5.8 $\\mu$m and 8.0 $\\mu$m bands conducted at the\npositions of the shorter wavelength sources. For sources with no detected\nobject in the longer wavelengths, we estimated magnitude limits based on the\nlocal sky background. The individual galaxy point source breakdown is the\nfollowing: NGC 55, 8746 sources; NGC 253, 9001 sources; NGC 2366, 505 sources;\nNGC 4214, 1185 sources; NGC 5253, 722 sources. The completeness limits of the\nfull catalog vary with bandpass and were found to be $m_{3.6}=18.0$,\n$m_{4.5}=17.5$, $m_{5.8}=17.0$, and $m_{8.0}=16.5$ mag. For all galaxies, this\ncorresponds to detection of point sources brighter than $M_{3.6}=-10$. These\ncatalogs can be used as a reference for stellar population investigations,\nindividual stellar object studies, and in planning future mid-infrared\nobservations with the James Webb Space Telescope.\n", "  Context. The fact that eclipsing binaries belong to a stellar group is\nuseful, because the former can be used to estimate distance and additional\nproperties of the latter, and vice versa. Aims. Our goal is to analyse new\nspectroscopic observations of BD$+36^\\circ3317$ along with the photometric\nobservations from the literature and, for the first time, to derive all basic\nphysical properties of this binary. We aim to find out whether the binary is\nindeed a member of the $\\delta$ Lyr open cluster. Methods. The spectra were\nreduced using the IRAF program and the radial velocities were measured with the\nprogram SPEFO. The line spectra of both components were disentangled with the\nprogram KOREL and compared to a grid of synthetic spectra. The final combined\nradial-velocity and photometric solution was obtained with the program PHOEBE.\nResults. We obtained the following physical elements of BD$+36^\\circ3317$: $M_1\n= 2.24\\pm0.07 M_{\\odot}$, $M_2 = 1.52\\pm0.03 M_{\\odot}$, $R_1 = 1.76\\pm0.01\nR_{\\odot}$, $R_2 = 1.46\\pm0.01 R_{\\odot}$, $log L_1 = 1.52\\pm0.08 L_{\\odot}$,\n$log L_2 = 0.81\\pm0.07 L_{\\odot}$. We derived the effective temperatures\n$T_{eff,1} = 10450 \\pm 420$ K, $T_{eff,2} = 7623 \\pm 328$ K. Both components\nare located close to ZAMS in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram and their\nmasses and radii are consistent with the predictions of stellar evolutionary\nmodels. Our results imply the average distance to the system d = $330\\pm29$ pc.\nWe re-investigated the membership of BD$+36^\\circ3317$ in the $\\delta$ Lyr\ncluster and confirmed it. The distance to BD$+36^\\circ3317$, given above,\ntherefore represents an accurate estimate of the true distance for $\\delta$ Lyr\ncluster. Conclusions. The reality of the $\\delta$ Lyr cluster and the cluster\nmembership of BD$+36^\\circ3317$ have been reinforced.\n", "  We study the interplay of hadronic and Coulomb interactions for $pp$\nscattering at LHC energies on the basis of the previous determination of the\nreal part of the amplitude [{\\it V.V. Anisovich, V.A. Nikonov, J. Nyiri}, Int.\nJ. Mod. Phys. A{\\bf 30}, 1550188 (2015)]. The interference of hadron and\nCoulomb interactions is discussed in terms of the $K$-matrix function\ntechnique. Supposing the black disk mode for the asymptotic interaction of\nhadrons, we calculate interference effects for the energies right up to\n$\\sqrt{s}= 10^6$ TeV. It turns out that the real part of the amplitude is\nconcentrated in the impact parameter space at the border of the black disk that\nresults in a growth of interplay effects with the energy increase.\n", "  In this paper anisotropic and dispersive wave propagation within linear\nstrain-gradient elasticity is investigated. This analysis reveals significant\nfeatures of this extended theory of continuum elasticity. First, and contrarily\nto classical elasticity, wave propagation in hexagonal (chiral or achiral)\nlattices becomes anisotropic as the frequency increases. Second, since\nstrain-gradient elasticity is dispersive, group and energy velocities have to\nbe treated as different quantities. These points are first theoretically\nderived, and then numerically experienced on hexagonal chiral and achiral\nlattices. The use of a continuum model for the description of the high\nfrequency behavior of these microstructured materials can be of great interest\nin engineering applications, allowing problems with complex geometries to be\nmore easily treated.\n", "  Recent developments in high-temperature superconductivity highlight a generic\ntendency of the cuprates to develop competing electronic (charge)\nsupermodulations. While coupled to the lattice and showing different\ncharacteristics in different materials, these supermodulations themselves are\ngenerally conceived to be quasi-two-dimensional, residing mainly in individual\nCuO2 planes, and poorly correlated along the c-axis. Here we observed with\nresonant elastic x-ray scattering a distinct type of electronic supermodulation\nin YBa2Cu3O7-x (YBCO) thin films grown epitaxially on La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 (LCMO).\nThis supermodulation has a periodicity nearly commensurate with four lattice\nconstants in-plane, eight out-of-plane, with long correlation lengths in three\ndimensions. It sets in far above the superconducting transition temperature and\ncompetes with superconductivity below this temperature for electronic states\npredominantly in the CuO2 plane. Our finding sheds new light on the nature of\ncharge ordering in cuprates as well as a reported long-range proximity effect\nbetween superconductivity and ferromagnetism in YBCO/LCMO heterostructures.\n", "  We present constraints on the nature of axions and axionlike particles (ALPs)\nby analyzing gamma--ray data from neutron stars using the Fermi Large Area\nTelescope. In addition to axions solving the strong CP problem of particle\nphysics, axions and ALPs are also possible dark matter candidates. We\ninvestigate axions and ALPs produced by nucleon--nucleon bremsstrahlung within\nneutron stars. We derive a phenomenological model for the gamma--ray spectrum\narising from subsequent axion decays. By analyzing 5 years of gamma-ray data\n(between 60 MeV and 200 MeV) for a sample of 4 nearby neutron stars, we do not\nfind evidence for an axion or ALP signal, thus we obtain a combined 95\\%\nconfidence level upper limit on the axion mass of 7.9$\\times 10^{-2}$ eV, which\ncorresponds to a lower limit for the Peccei-Quinn scale $f_a$ of 7.6$\\times\n10^7$ GeV. Our constraints are more stringent than previous results probing the\nsame physical process, and are competitive with results probing axions and ALPs\nby different mechanisms.\n", "  Considering the constraints on the lepton flavor violating (LFV) couplings of\nthe new gauge boson $Z'$ to ordinary leptons from the experimental upper limit\nfor the LFV process $\\ell\\rightarrow 3\\ell'$, we calculate the contributions of\n$Z'$ to the LFV decays $V\\rightarrow\\ell_{i}\\ell_{j}$ with\n$V\\in\\{\\phi,J/\\Psi,\\Psi(2S),\\Upsilon^{(n)}\\}$ and $\\tau\\to\\mu(e)\\phi$ in the\ncontext of several $Z'$ models. We find that all $Z'$ models considered in this\npaper can produce significant contributions to these decay processes and make\nthe value of the branching ratio $Br(\\tau\\to e\\phi)$ above its experimental\nupper limit. The experimental upper limit of $\\tau\\to e\\phi$ can give more\nsevere constraints on these $Z'$ models than those given by the rare decay\nprocess $\\tau\\to3e$.\n", "  Carbon tetrachloride (CCl$_4$) is one of the simplest compounds having a\ntranslationally stable monoclinic phase while exhibiting a rich rotational\ndynamics below 226 K. Recent nuclear quadrupolar resonance (NQR) experiments\nrevealed that the dynamics of CCl$_4$ is similar to that of the other members\nof the isostructural series CBr$_{n}$Cl$_{4-n}$, suggesting that the universal\nrelaxation features of canonical glasses such as $\\alpha$- and\n$\\beta$-relaxation are also present in non-glass formers. Using molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations we studied the rotational dynamics in the monoclinic\nphase of CCl$_4$. The molecules undergo $C3$ type jump-like rotations around\neach one of the four C-Cl bonds. The rotational dynamics is very well described\nwith a master equation using as the only input the rotational rates measured\nfrom the simulated trajectories. It is found that the heterogeneous dynamics\nemerges from faster and slower modes associated with different rotational axes,\nwhich have fixed orientations relative to the crystal and are distributed among\nthe four non-equivalent molecules of the unit cell.\n", "  The purpose of this work is to propose a non-Markovian and nonlinear model of\nsubdiffusive transport that involves adhesion affects the cells escape rates\nform position x, with chemotaxis. This leads the escape rates to be dependent\non the particles density at the neighbours as well as the chemotactic gradient.\nWe systematically derive subdiffusive fractional master equation, then we\nconsider the diffusive limit of the fractional master equation. We finally\nsolve the resulted fractional subdiffusive master equation stationery and\nanalyse the role of adhesion in the resulted stationary density.\n", "  The transition-metal dichalcogenides have attracted a lot of attention as a\npossible stepping-stone toward atomically thin and flexible field-effect\ntransistors. One key parameter to describe the charge transport is the time\nbetween two successive scattering events - the transport scattering time. In a\nrecent report, we have shown that it is possible to use density functional\ntheory to obtain the band structure of two-dimensional semiconductors in\npresence of field effect doping. Here, we report a simple method to extract the\nscattering time from the experimental conductivity and from the knowledge of\nthe band structure. We apply our approach to monolayers and multilayers of\nMoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, MoTe$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$ in presence of a gate. In\nWS$_2$, for which accurate measurements of mobility have been published, we\nfind that the scattering time is inversely proportional to the density of\nstates at the Fermi level. Finally, we show that it is possible to identify the\ncritical doping at which different valleys start to be occupied from the\ndoping-dependence of the conductivity.\n", "  We present a unified model describing electroweak properties of the pi and\nrho mesons. Using a general method of relativistic parametrization of matrix\nelements of local operators, adjusted for the nondiagonal in total angular\nmomentum case, we calculate the rho-meson lepton-decay constant f_rho using the\nsame parameters of free constituent quarks that have ensured exclusively good\nresults for the pi meson previously. The only free parameter, characterizing\nquark interactions, which include additional spin-spin contribution and hence\ndiffer from the $\\pi$-meson case, is fixed by matching the decay constant to\nits experimental value. The mean square charge radius is calculated,\n<r^2_rho>=(0.56+-0.04) fm^2. This result verifies, for the rho-meson case, the\nconjecture of equality between electromagnetic and strong radii of hadrons\ntested previously for proton, pi and K mesons.\n", "  The comparison of the results of direct detection of Dark Matter, obtained\nwith various target nuclei, requires model-dependent, or even arbitrary,\nassumptions. Indeed, to draw conclusions either the spin-dependent (SD) or the\nspin-independent (SI) interaction has to be neglected. In the light of the null\nresults from supersymmetry searches at the LHC, the squark sector is pushed to\nhigh masses. We show that for a squark sector at the TeV scale, the framework\nused to extract contraints from direct detection searches can be redefined as\nthe number of free parameters is reduced. Moreover, the correlation observed\nbetween SI and SD proton cross sections constitutes a key issue for the\ndevelopment of the next generation of Dark Matter detectors.\n", "  We show how a singly quantized vortex can exhibit energetically stable defect\ncores with different symmetries in an atomic spin-1 polar Bose-Einstein\ncondensate, and how a stable topologically nontrivial Skyrmion texture of lower\ndimensionality can be confined inside the core. The core isotropy and the\nstability of the confined texture are sensitive to Zeeman level shifts. The\nobserved structures have analogies, respectively, in pressure-dependent\nsymmetries of superfluid liquid He-3 vortices and in the models of\nsuperconducting cosmic strings.\n", "  In this paper we will examine the consequence of a canonical theory of\nquantum dust collapse in 2+1 dimensions. The solution of the WDW equation\ndescribing the collapse indicates that collapsing shells outside the apparent\nhorizon are accompanied by outgoing shells within the apparent horizon during\ntheir collapse phase and stop collapsing once they reach the apparent horizon.\nTaking this picture of quantum collapse seriously, we determine a static\nsolution with energy density corresponding to a dust ball whose collapse has\nterminated at the apparent horizon. We show that the boundary radius of the\nball is larger than the BTZ radius confirming that no event horizon is formed.\nThe ball is sustained by radial pressure which we determine and which we\nattribute to the Unruh radiation within it.\n", "  On the basis of ab initio quantum mechanics (QM) calculation, the obtained\nelectron heat capacity is implemented into energy equation of electron\nsubsystem in two temperature model (TTM). Upon laser irradiation on the copper\nfilm, energy transfer from the electron subsystem to the lattice subsystem is\nmodeled by including the electron-phonon coupling factor in molecular dynamics\n(MD) and TTM coupled simulation. The results show temperature and thermal\nmelting difference between the QM-MD-TTM integrated simulation and pure MD-TTM\ncoupled simulation. The successful construction of the QM-MD-TTM integrated\nsimulation provide a general way that is accessible to other metals in laser\nheating.\n", "  We introduce quantum optical dipole radiation fields defined in terms of\nphoton creation and annihilation operators. These fields are identified through\ntheir spatial dependence, as the components of the total fields that survive\ninfinitely far from the dipole source. We use these radiation fields to\nperturbatively evaluate the electromagnetic radiated energy-flux of the excited\ndipole. Our results indicate that the standard interpretation of a bare atom\nsurrounded by a localised virtual photon cloud, is difficult to sustain,\nbecause the radiated energy-flux surviving infinitely far from the source\ncontains virtual contributions. It follows that there is a clear distinction to\nbe made between a radiative photon defined in terms of the radiation fields,\nand a real photon, whose identification depends on whether or not a given\nprocess conserves the free energy. This free energy is represented by the\ndifference between the total dipole-field Hamiltonian and its interaction\ncomponent.\n", "  We explore the observational adequacy of a class of Unified Dark\nEnergy/Matter (UDE/M) models with a fast transition. Our constraints are set\nusing a combination of geometric probes, some low redshift ones, and some high\nredshift ones (CMB related included). The transition is phenomenologically\nmodeled by two different transition functions corresponding to a fast and to an\nultra-fast transition respectively. We find that the key parameters governing\nthe transition can be well constrained, and from the statistical point of view\nit follows that the models cannot be discarded when compared to $\\Lambda$CDM.\nWe find the intriguing result that standard/input parameters such as $\\Omega_m$\nand $\\Omega_b$ are far better constrained than in $\\Lambda$CDM, and this is the\ncase for the derived/output parameter measuring the deceleration value at\npresent, $q_0$.\n", "  We present the development of the miniTimeCube (mTC), a novel compact\nneutrino detector. The mTC is a multipurpose detector, aiming to detect not\nonly neutrinos but also fast/thermal neutrons. Potential applications include\nthe counterproliferation of nuclear materials and the investigation of\nantineutrino short-baseline effects. The mTC is a plastic 0.2% $^{10}$B - doped\nscintillator (13 cm)$^3$ cube surrounded by 24 Micro-Channel Plate (MCP) photon\ndetectors, each with an $8\\times8$ anode totaling 1536 individual\nchannels/pixels viewing the scintillator. It uses custom-made electronics\nmodules which mount on top of the MCPs, making our detector compact and able to\nboth distinguish different types of events and reject noise in real time. The\ndetector is currently deployed and being tested at the National Institute of\nStandards and Technology (NIST) Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) nuclear\nreactor (20 MW$_\\mathrm{th}$) in Gaithersburg, MD. A shield for further tests\nis being constructed, and calibration and upgrades are ongoing. The mTC's\nimproved spatiotemporal resolution will allow for determination of incident\nparticle directions beyond previous capabilities.\n", "  Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP) have recently been proposed as metallicity\n($Z$) probes. The spectral models of Dessart et al. (2014) showed that the\npseudo-equivalent width of Fe II $\\lambda$5018 (pEW$_{5018}$) during the\nplateau phase depends on the primordial $Z$, but there was a paucity of SNe IIP\nexhibiting pEW$_{5018}$ that were compatible with $Z < 0.4$ ${\\rm Z}_{\\odot}$.\nThis lack might be due to some physical property of the SN II population or to\nthe fact that those SNe have been discovered in luminous, metal-rich targeted\ngalaxies. Here we use SN II observations from the untargeted (intermediate)\nPalomar Transient Factory [(i)PTF] survey, aiming to investigate the\npEW$_{5018}$ distribution of this SN population and, in particular, to look for\nthe presence of SNe II at lower $Z$. We perform pEW$_{5018}$ measurements on\nthe spectra of a sample of 39 (i)PTF SNe II, selected to have well-constrained\nexplosion epochs and light-curve properties. Based on the comparison with the\npEW$_{5018}$ spectral models, we subgrouped our SNe into four $Z$ bins from $Z\n\\approx 0.1$ $Z_{\\odot}$ up to $Z \\approx 2$ $Z_{\\odot}$. We also independently\ninvestigated the $Z$ of the hosts by using their absolute magnitudes and colors\nand, in a few cases, using strong-line diagnostics from spectra. We searched\nfor possible correlations between SN observables, such as their peak magnitudes\nand the $Z$ inferred from pEW$_{5018}$. We found 11 events with pEW$_{5018}$\nthat were small enough to indicate $Z \\approx 0.1$ $Z_{\\odot}$. The trend of\npEW$_{5018}$ with $Z$ matches the $Z$ estimates obtained from the host-galaxy\nphotometry, although the significance of the correlation is weak. We also found\nthat SNe with brighter peak magnitudes have smaller pEW$_{5018}$ and occur at\nlower $Z$.\n", "  Recent advance in quantum simulations of interacting photons using\nsuperconducting circuits offers opportunities for investigating the\nBose-Hubbard model in various geometries with hopping coefficients and\nself-interactions tuned to both signs. Here we investigate phenomena related to\nlocalized states associated with a flat-band supported by the saw-tooth\ngeometry. A localization-delocalization transition emerges in the\nnon-interacting regime as the sign of hopping coefficient is changed. In the\npresence of interactions, patterns of localized states approach a uniform\ndensity distribution for repulsive interactions while interesting localized\ndensity patterns can arise in strongly attractive regime. The density patterns\nindicate the underlying inhomogeneity of the simulator. Two-particle\ncorrelations can further distinguish the nature of the localized states in\nattractive and repulsive interaction regimes. We also survey possible\nexperimental implementations of the simulator.\n", "  The emergent behavior of spin liquids that are born out of geometrical\nfrustration makes them an intriguing state of matter. We show that in the\nquantum kagome antiferromagnet ZnCu$_3$(OH)$_6$SO$_4$ several different\ncorrelated, yet fluctuating states exist. By combining complementary\nlocal-probe techniques with neutron scattering, we discover a crossover from a\ncritical regime into a gapless spin-liquid phase with decreasing temperature.\nAn additional unconventional instability of the latter phase leads to a second,\ndistinct spin-liquid state that is stabilized at the lowest temperatures. We\nadvance such complex behavior as a feature common to different frustrated\nquantum magnets.\n", "  A model, which is widely used for inertial rang statistics of supersonic\nturbulence in the context of molecular clouds and star formation, expresses\n(measurable) relative scaling exponents Z_p of two-point velocity statistics as\na function of two parameters, beta and Delta. The model relates them to the\ndimension D of the most dissipative structures, D=3-Delta/(1-beta). While this\ndescription has proved most successful for incompressible turbulence\n(beta=Delta=2/3, and D=1), its applicability in the highly compressible regime\nremains debated. For this regime, theoretical arguments suggest D=2 and\nDelta=2/3, or Delta=1. Best estimates based on 3D periodic box simulations of\nsupersonic isothermal turbulence yield Delta=0.71 and D=1.9, with uncertainty\nranges of Delta in [0.67, 0.78] and D in [2.04,1.60]. With these 5-10\\%\nuncertainty ranges just marginally including the theoretical values of\nDelta=2/3 and D=2, doubts remain whether the model indeed applies and, if it\napplies, for what values of beta and Delta. We use a Monte Carlo approach to\nmimic actual simulation data and examine what factors are most relevant for the\nfit quality. We estimate that 0.1% (0.05%) accurate Z_p, with p=1...5, should\nallow for 2% (1%) accurate estimates of beta and Delta in the highly\ncompressible regime, but not in the mildly compressible regime. We argue that\nsimulation-based Z_p with such accuracy are within reach of today's computer\nresources. If this kind of data does not allow for the expected high quality\nfit of beta and Delta, then this may indicate the inapplicability of the model\nfor the simulation data. In fact, other models than the one we examine here\nhave been suggested.\n", "  Manipulating individual vortices in a deterministic way is challenging,\nideally, manipulation should be effective, local, and tunable in strength and\nlocation. Here, we show that vortices interact with strain fields generated by\nmechanical stress. We utilized this interaction to move individual vortices in\nthin superconducting films via local mechanical contact, without magnetic field\nor current. We used a scanning superconducting quantum interference device\n(SQUID) to image vortices and to apply local vertical stress with the tip of\nour sensor. Vortices were attracted to the contact point, relocated, and were\nstable at their new location. We show that vortices move only after contact and\nthat more effective manipulation is achieved with stronger force and longer\ncontact time. Mechanical manipulation of vortices provides a local view of the\ninteraction between strain and nanomagnetic objects as well as controllable,\neffective, and reproducible manipulation technique.\n", "  Models invoking the chemical master equation are used in many areas of\nscience, and, hence, their simulation is of interest to many researchers. The\ncomplexity of the problems at hand often requires considerable computational\npower, so a large number of algorithms have been developed to speed up\nsimulations. However, a drawback of many of these algorithms is that their\nimplementation is more complicated than, for instance, the Gillespie algorithm,\nwhich is widely used to simulate the chemical master equation, and can be\nimplemented with a few lines of code. Here, we present an algorithm which does\nnot modify the way in which the master equation is solved, but instead modifies\nthe transition rates, and can thus be implemented with a few lines of code. It\nworks for all models in which reversible reactions occur by replacing such\nreversible reactions with effective net reactions. Examples of such systems\ninclude reaction-diffusion systems, in which diffusion is modelled by a random\nwalk. The random movement of particles between neighbouring sites is then\nreplaced with a net random flux. Furthermore, as we modify the transition rates\nof the model, rather than its implementation on a computer, our method can be\ncombined with existing algorithms that were designed to speed up simulations of\nthe stochastic master equation. By focusing on some specific models, we show\nhow our algorithm can significantly speed up model simulations while\nmaintaining essential features of the original model.\n", "  To explore the origin of the unusual non-bulk superconductivity with a Tc up\nto 49 K reported in the rare-earth-doped CaFe2As2 , the chemical composition,\nmagnetization, specific heat, resistivity, and annealing effect are\nsystematically investigated on nominal (Ca1-xRx)Fe2As2 single crystals with\ndifferent x's and R = La, Ce, Pr, and Nd. All display a doping-independent Tc\nonce superconductivity is induced, a doping-dependent low field superconducting\nvolume fraction f, and a large magnetic anisotropy {\\eta} in the\nsuperconducting state, suggesting a rather inhomogeneous superconducting state\nin an otherwise microscale-homogenous superconductor. The wavelength dispersive\nspectroscopy and specific heat show the presence of defects which are closely\nrelated to f, regardless of the R involved. The magnetism further reveals that\nthe defects are mainly superparamagnetic clusters for R = Ce, Pr, and Nd with\nstrong intercluster interactions, implying that defects are locally\nself-organized. Annealing at 500 {\\deg}C, without varying the doping level x,\nsuppresses f profoundly but not the Tc. The above observations provide evidence\nfor the crucial role of defects in the occurrence of the unusually high Tc ~ 49\nK in (Ca1-xRx)Fe2As2 and are consistent with the interface-enhanced\nsuperconductivity recently proposed.\n", "  We demonstrate a nonradiative flat band for spoof surface plasmon polaritons\nbounded on a structured surface with Lieb lattice symmetry in the terahertz\nregime. First, we theoretically derive the dispersion relation of spoof\nplasmons in a metallic Lieb lattice based on the electrical circuit model. We\nobtain three bands, one of which is independent of wave vector. To confirm the\ntheoretical result, we numerically and experimentally observe the flat band in\ntransmission and attenuated total reflection configurations. We reveal that the\nquality factor of the nonradiative flat-band mode decoupled from the\npropagating wave is higher than that of the radiative flat-band mode. This\nindicates that the nonradiative flat-band mode is three-dimensionally confined\nin the lattice.\n", "  We construct simple models for all topological phases of free fermions. These\nexplicit models can realize all the nontrivial topological phases (with any\npossible topological invariant) of the periodic table. Many well known models\nfor topological insulators and superconductors are special cases of our general\nconstructions.\n", "  Transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors have been widely studied\ndue to their distinctive electronic and optical properties. The property of TMD\nflakes is a function of its thickness, or layer number (N). How to determine N\nof ultrathin TMDs materials is of primary importance for fundamental study and\npractical applications. Raman mode intensity from substrates has been used to\nidentify N of intrinsic and defective multilayer graphenes up to N=100.\nHowever, such analysis is not applicable for ultrathin TMD flakes due to the\nlack of a unified complex refractive index ($\\tilde{n}$) from monolayer to bulk\nTMDs. Here, we discuss the N identification of TMD flakes on the SiO$_2$/Si\nsubstrate by the intensity ratio between the Si peak from 100-nm (or 89-nm)\nSiO$_2$/Si substrates underneath TMD flakes and that from bare SiO$_2$/Si\nsubstrates. We assume the real part of $\\tilde{n}$ of TMD flakes as that of\nmonolayer TMD and treat the imaginary part of $\\tilde{n}$ as a fitting\nparameter to fit the experimental intensity ratio. An empirical $\\tilde{n}$,\nnamely, $\\tilde{n}_{eff}$, of ultrathin MoS$_{2}$, WS$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$\nflakes from monolayer to multilayer is obtained for typical laser excitations\n(2.54 eV, 2.34 eV, or 2.09 eV). The fitted $\\tilde{n}_{eff}$ of MoS$_{2}$ has\nbeen used to identify N of MoS$_{2}$ flakes deposited on 302-nm SiO$_2$/Si\nsubstrate, which agrees well with that determined from their shear and\nlayer-breathing modes. This technique by measuring Raman intensity from the\nsubstrate can be extended to identify N of ultrathin 2D flakes with N-dependent\n$\\tilde{n}$ . For the application purpose, the intensity ratio excited by\nspecific laser excitations has been provided for MoS$_{2}$, WS$_{2}$ and\nWSe$_{2}$ flakes and multilayer graphene flakes deposited on Si substrates\ncovered by 80-110 nm or 280-310 nm SiO$_2$ layer.\n", "  We explore the electronic structure and transport properties of a metal on\ntop of a (weakly coupled) two-dimensional topological insulator. Unlike the\nwidely studied junctions between topological non-trivial materials, the systems\nstudied here allow for a unique bandstructure and transport steering. First,\nstates on the topological insulator layer may coexist with the gapless bulk\nand, second, the edge states on one edge can be selectively switched-off,\nthereby leading to nearly perfect directional transport of charge and spin even\nin the zero bias limit. We illustrate these phenomena for Bernal stacked\nbilayer graphene with Haldane or intrinsic spin-orbit terms and a perpendicular\nbias voltage. This opens a path for realizing directed transport in materials\nsuch as van der Waals heterostructures, monolayer and ultrathin topological\ninsulators.\n", "  We present a theory based on first-principles calculations explaining (i) why\nthe tunability of spin polarizations of photoelectrons from Bi$_2$Se$_3$ (111)\ndepends on the band index and Bloch wavevector of the surface state and (ii)\nwhy such tunability is absent in the case of isosymmetric Au (111). The results\nprovide not only an explanation for the recent, puzzling experimental\nobservations but also a guide toward making highly-tunable spin-polarized\nelectron sources from topological insulators.\n", "  First-forbidden (FF) charge-changing transitions become relatively important\nfor nuclei as their proton number increases. This is because the strength of\nallowed Gamow-Teller (GT) transitions decreases with increasing Z. The FF\ntransitions play an important role in reducing the half-lives as against those\ncalculated from taking the GT transitions alone into account. In this paper we\ncalculate allowed GT as well as $0^{+} \\rightarrow 0^{-}$ and $0^{+}\n\\rightarrow 2^{-}$ transitions for neutron-rich Zn and Ge isotopes. Two\ndifferent pn-QRPA models were used with a schematic separable interaction to\ncalculate GT and FF transitions. Half-lives calculated after inclusion of FF\ntransitions were in excellent agreement with the experimental data. Our\ncalculations were also compared to previous QRPA calculations and were found to\nbe in better agreement with measured data. Stellar $\\beta$-decay rates were\ncalculated for these nuclei including allowed GT and unique FF transitions for\nastrophysical applications. $^{86,88}$Ge has a sizeable contribution to the\ntotal stellar rate from unique FF transitions.\n", "  First-forbidden (FF) transitions can play an important role in decreasing the\ncalculated half-lives specially in environments where allowed Gamow-Teller (GT)\ntransitions are unfavored. Of special mention is the case of neutron-rich\nnuclei where, due to phase-space amplification, FF transitions are much\nfavored. We calculate the allowed GT transitions in various pn-QRPA models for\neven-even neutron-rich isotopes of nickel. Here we also study the effect of\ndeformation on the calculated GT strengths. The FF transitions for even-even\nneutron-rich isotopes of nickel are calculated assuming the nuclei to be\nspherical. Later we take into account deformation of nuclei and calculate GT +\nunique FF transitions, stellar $\\beta$-decay rates, energy rate of\n$\\beta$-delayed neutrons and probability of $\\beta$-delayed neutron emissions.\nThe calculated half-lives are in excellent agreement with measured ones and\nmight contribute in speeding-up of the $r$-matter flow.\n", "  Detection and mitigation of radio frequency interference (RFI) is the first\nand also the key step for data processing in radio observations, especially for\nongoing low frequency radio experiments towards the detection of the cosmic\ndawn and epoch of reionization (EoR). In this paper we demonstrate the\ntechnique and efficiency of RFI identification and mitigation for the 21\nCentimeter Array (21CMA), a radio interferometer dedicated to the statistical\nmeasurement of EoR. For terrestrial, man-made RFI, we concentrate mainly on a\nstatistical approach by identifying and then excising non-Gaussian signatures,\nin the sense that the extremely weak cosmic signal is actually buried under\nthermal and therefore Gaussian noise. We also introduce the so-called\nvisibility correlation coefficient instead of conventional visibility, which\nallows a further suppression of rapidly time-varying RFI. Finally, we briefly\ndiscuss removals of the sky RFI, the leakage of sidelobes from off-field strong\nradio sources with time-invariant power and a featureless spectrum. It turns\nout that state of the art technique should allow us to detect and mitigate RFI\nto a satisfactory level in present low frequency interferometer observations\nsuch as those acquired with the 21CMA, and the accuracy and efficiency can be\ngreatly improved with the employment of low-cost, high-speed computing\nfacilities for data acquisition and processing.\n", "  We investigate even-even nuclei in the $A\\sim70$ mass region within the\nframework of the proton-neutron quasi-particle random phase approximation\n(\\mbox{pn-QRPA}) and the interacting boson model-1 (\\mbox{IBM-1}). Our work\nincludes calculation of the energy spectra and the potential energy surfaces\n$V(\\beta,\\gamma)$ of Zn, Ge, Se, Kr and Sr nuclei with the same proton and\nneutron number, $N = Z$. The parametrization of the \\mbox{IBM-1} Hamiltonian\nwas performed for the calculation of the energy levels in the ground state\nbands. Geometric shape of the nuclei was predicted by plotting the potential\nenergy surfaces $V(\\beta,\\gamma)$ obtained from the \\mbox{IBM-1} Hamiltonian in\nthe classical limit. The \\mbox{pn-QRPA} model was later used to compute\nhalf-lives of the neutron-deficient nuclei which were found to be in very good\nagreement with the measured ones. The \\mbox{pn-QRPA} model was also used to\ncalculate the Gamow-Teller strength distributions and was found to be in decent\nagreement with the measured data. We further calculate the electron capture and\npositron decay rates for these $N$ = $Z$ waiting point (WP) nuclei in the\nstellar environment employing the \\mbox{pn-QRPA} model. For the $rp$-process\nconditions, our total weak rates are within a factor two compared with the\nSkyrme HF+BCS+QRPA calculation. All calculated electron capture rates are\ncomparable to the competing positron decay rates under $rp$-process conditions.\nOur study confirms the finding that electron capture rates form an integral\npart of the weak rates under $rp$-process conditions and should not be\nneglected in the nuclear network calculations.\n", "  We present an approach to deriving global properties of accretion disks from\nthe knowledge of local solutions derived from numerical simulations based on\nthe shearing box approximation. The approach consists of a two-step procedure.\nFirst a local solution valid for all values of the disk height is constructed\nby piecing together an interior solution obtained numerically with an\nanalytical exterior radiative solution. The matching is obtained by assuming\nhydrostatic balance and radiative equilibrium. Although in principle the\nprocedure can be carried out in general, it simplifies considerably when the\ninterior solution is fully convective. In these cases, the construction is\nanalogous to the derivation of the Hayashi tracks for protostars. The second\nstep consists of piecing together the local solutions at different radii to\nobtain a global solution. Here we use the symmetry of the solutions with\nrespect to the defining dimensionless numbers--in a way similar to the use of\nhomology relations in stellar structure theory--to obtain the scaling\nproperties of the various disk quantities with radius.\n", "  The current status of the application of covariant density functional theory\nto the description of actinides and superheavy nuclei is reviewed. The\nachievements and open problems are discussed.\n", "  The rigorous treatment of proton localization phenomenon in asymmetric\nnuclear matter is presented. The solution of proton wave function and neutron\nbackground distribution is found by the use of the extended Thomas-Fermi\napproach. The minimum of energy is obtained in the Wigner- Seitz approximation\nof spherically symmetric cell. The analysis of three different nuclear models\nsuggests that the proton localization is likely to take place in the interior\nof neutron star.\n", "  Methods of complex evaluation based on local, forecasting, aggregated, and\ninteractive evaluation of the state, function quality, and interaction of\ncomplex system's objects on the all hierarchical levels is proposed. Examples\nof analysis of the structural elements of railway transport system are used for\nillustration of efficiency of proposed approach.\n", "  This article presents results of further investigation of the problem of\nspurious interface fragmentation in the multiphase SPH. In order to remove\narising instabilities, many authors introduced the artificial interface\ncorrection procedure. In the present paper we show that the interface\ninstabilities are physical and the introduction of the interface correction\nprocedure may leads to non-physical solutions. We also explain the puzzling\nrelation between the parameters $\\varepsilon$ and $h$. The analysis is\nperformed on the basis of the stability analysis and numerical calculations\nusing SPH and Volume Of Fluid (VOF) approach.\n", "  We demonstrate a silicon-chip biphoton source with an unprecedented quantum\ncross correlation up to ${\\rm g_{si}^{(2)}(0) = (2.58 \\pm 0.16) \\times 10^4}$.\nThe emitted biphotons are intrinsically single-mode, with self correlations of\n${\\rm g_{ss}^{(2)}(0) = 1.90 \\pm 0.05}$ and ${\\rm g_{ii}^{(2)}(0) = 1.87 \\pm\n0.06}$ for signal and idler photons, respectively. We observe the waveform\nasymmetry of cross correlation between signal and idler photons and reveal the\nidentical and non-exponential nature of self correlations of individual signal\nand idler photon modes, which is a nature of cavity-enhanced nonlinear optical\nprocesses. The high efficiency and high purity of the biphoton source allow us\nto herald single photons with a conditional self correlation $\\rm\ng_{c}^{(2)}(0)$ as low as $\\rm 0.0059 \\pm 0.0014$ at a pair flux of $\\rm 1.95\n\\times 10^5$ pairs/s, which remains below $\\rm 0.026 \\pm 0.001$ for a biphoton\nflux up to $\\rm 2.93 \\times 10^6$ pairs/s, with a photon preparation efficiency\nin the single-mode fiber up to 51%, among the best values that have ever been\nreported. Our work unambiguously demonstrates that silicon photonic chips are\nsuperior material and device platforms for integrated quantum photonics.\n", "  A kinetic theory model is developed for positron-impact ionization (PII) with\nneutral, rarefied gases. Particular attention is given to the sharing of\navailable energy between the post-ionization constituents. A simple model for\nthe energy-partition function that qualitatively captures the physics of\nhigh-energy and near-threshold ionization is developed for PII, with free\nparameters that can be used to fit the model to experimental data. By applying\nthe model to the measurements of Kover and Laricchia [1] for positrons in H2,\nthe role of energy-partitioning in PII for positron thermalisation is studied.\nAlthough the overall thermalisation time is found to be relatively insensitive\nto the energy-partitioning, the mean energy profiles at certain times can\ndiffer by more than an order of magnitude for the various treatments of\nenergy-partitioning. This can significantly impact the number and energy\ndistribution of secondary electrons.\n", "  We present an exact expression for the $1/f$ contribution to the noise of the\nCMB temperature and polarization maps for a survey in which the scan pattern is\nisotropic. The result for polarization applies likewise to surveys with and\nwithout a rotating half-wave plate. A representative range of survey parameters\nis explored and implications for the design and optimization of future surveys\nare discussed. These results are most directly applicable to space-based\nsurveys, which afford considerable freedom in the choice of the scan pattern on\nthe celestial sphere. We discuss the applicability of the methods developed\nhere to analyzing past experiments and present some conclusions pertinent to\nthe design of future experiments. The techniques developed here do not require\nthat the excess low frequency noise have exactly the $1/f$ shape and readily\ngeneralize to other functional forms for the detector noise power spectrum. In\nthe case of weakly anisotropic scanning patterns the techniques in this paper\ncan be used to find a preconditioner for solving the map making equation\nefficiently using the conjugate gradient method.\n", "  The analysis of RLC circuits is usually made by considering phasor transforms\nof sinusoidal signals (characterized by constant amplitude, period and phase)\nthat allow the calculation of the AC steady state of RLC circuits by solving\nsimple algebraic equations. In this paper I try to show that phasor\nrepresentation of RLC circuits is analogue to consider the frequency response\nfunction (commonly designated by FRF) of the total impedance of the circuit. In\nthis way I derive accurate expressions for the resonance and anti-resonance\nfrequencies and their corresponding values of impedances of the parallel and\nseries RLC circuits respectively, notwithstanding the presence of damping\neffects.\n", "  Gravitational collapse of cylindrical anisotropic fluid has been considered\nin analogy with the work of Misner and Sharp. Using Darmois matching\nconditions, the interior cylindrical dissipative fluid (in the form of shear\nviscosity and heat flux )is matched to an exterior vacuum Einstein--Rosen\nspace-time. It is found that on the bounding 3-surface the radial pressure of\nthe anisotropic perfect fluid is linearly related to the shear viscosity and\nthe heat flux of the dissipative fluid on the boundary. This non-zero radial\npressure on the bounding surface may be considered as the source of\ngravitational waves outside the collapsing matter distribution.\n", "  Comet 103P/Hartley 2 has diurnally controlled, CO2-driven activity on the tip\nof the small lobe of its bilobate nucleus. Such activity is unique among the\ncomet nuclei visited by spacecraft, and suggests that CO2 ice is very near the\nsurface, which is inconsistent with our expectations of an object that\nthermophysically evolved for ~45 million years prior to entering the Jupiter\nFamily of comets. Here we explain this pattern of activity by showing that a\nvery plausible recent episode of rapid rotation (rotation period of ~11 [10-13]\nhours) would have induced avalanches in Hartley 2's currently active regions\nthat excavated down to CO2-rich ices and activated the small lobe of the\nnucleus. At Hartley 2's current rate of spindown about its principal axis, the\nnucleus would have been spinning fast enough to induce avalanches ~3-4 orbits\nprior to the DIXI flyby (~1984-1991). This coincides with Hartley 2's discovery\nin 1986, and implies that the initiation of CO2 activity facilitated the\ncomet's discovery. During the avalanches, the sliding material would either be\nlofted off the surface by gas activity, or possibly gained enough momentum\nmoving downhill (toward the tip of the small lobe) to slide off the nucleus.\nMuch of this material would have failed to reach escape velocity, and would\nreimpact the nucleus, forming debris deposits. The similar size frequency\ndistribution of the mounds observed on the surface of Hartley 2 and chunks of\nmaterial in its inner coma suggest that the 20-40 meter mounds observed by the\nDIXI mission on the surface of Hartley 2 are potentially these fallback debris\ndeposits. As the nucleus spun down from a rotation period of ~11 hours to 18.34\nhours at the time of the DIXI flyby, the location of potential minima, where\nmaterials preferentially settle, migrated about the surface, allowing us to\nplace relative ages on most of the imaged terrains of the nucleus.\n", "  We introduce a new, reduced nonlinear oscillator model governing the\nspontaneous creation of sharp pulses in a damped, driven, cubic nonlinear\nSchroedinger equation. The reduced model embodies the fundamental connection\nbetween mode synchronization and spatiotemporal pulse formation. We identify\nattracting solutions corresponding to stable cavity solitons and Turing\npatterns. Viewed in the optical context, our results explain the recently\nreported $\\pi$ and $\\pi/2$ steps in the phase spectrum of microresonator-based\noptical frequency combs.\n", "  Living systems, particularly multicellular systems, often seem hopelessly\ncomplex. But recent studies have suggested that beneath this complexity, there\nmay be unifying quantitative principles that we are only now starting to\nunravel. All cells interact with their environments and with other cells.\nCommunication among cells is a primary means for cells to interact with each\nother. The complexity of these multicellular systems, due to the large numbers\nof cells and the diversity of intracellular and intercellular interactions,\nmakes understanding multicellular systems a daunting task. To overcome this\nchallenge, we will likely need judicious simplifications and conceptual\nframeworks that can reveal design principles that are shared among diverse\nmulticellular systems. Here we review some recent progress towards developing\nsuch frameworks.\n", "  We present measurements of the diffusion-limited growth of ice crystals from\nwater vapor at a temperature of -5 C, in air at a pressure of $p_{air}=1$ bar.\nStarting with thin, c-axis ice needle crystals, the subsequent growth\nmorphologies ranged from solid prismatic columns to hollow columns to complex\n\"fishbone\" dendritic structures as the supersaturation was increased. We\nmodeled the simpler morphologies using analytical techniques together with a\ncellular-automata method that yields faceted crystalline structures in\ndiffusion-limited growth. We found that the molecular attachment coefficient\n$\\alpha_{prism}$ on faceted prism surfaces in air at -5 C is substantially\nlower than that measured at low background air pressure. Our data show that\nincreasing $p_{air}$ from 0.01 to 1 bar reduces $\\alpha_{prism}$ by nearly two\norders of magnitude at this temperature. In contrast, we find that\n$\\alpha_{basil}$ is essentially unaffected by air pressure over this range.\nThese and other measurements indicate that ice surfaces near the melting point\nundergo a series of complex structural and dynamical changes with temperature\nthat remain largely unexplained at even a qualitative level.\n", "  We consider the problem of finding a $k\\times k$ submatrix of an $n\\times n$\nmatrix with i.i.d. standard Gaussian entries, which has a large average entry.\nIt was shown earlier by Bhamidi et al. that the largest average value of such a\nmatrix is $2\\sqrt{\\log n/k}$ with high probability. In the same paper an\nevidence was provided that a natural greedy algorithm called Largest Average\nSubmatrix ($\\LAS$) should produce a matrix with average entry approximately\n$\\sqrt{2}$ smaller.\n  In this paper we show that the matrix produced by the $\\LAS$ algorithm is\nindeed $\\sqrt{2\\log n/k}$ w.h.p. Then by drawing an analogy with the problem of\nfinding cliques in random graphs, we propose a simple greedy algorithm which\nproduces a $k\\times k$ matrix with asymptotically the same average value. Since\nthe greedy algorithm is the best known algorithm for finding cliques in random\ngraphs, it is tempting to believe that beating the factor $\\sqrt{2}$\nperformance gap suffered by both algorithms might be very challenging.\nSurprisingly, we show the existence of a very simple algorithm which produces a\nmatrix with average value $(4/3)\\sqrt{2\\log n/k}$.\n  To get an insight into the algorithmic hardness of this problem, and\nmotivated by methods originating in the theory of spin glasses, we conduct the\nso-called expected overlap analysis of matrices with average value\nasymptotically $\\alpha\\sqrt{2\\log n/k}$. The overlap corresponds to the number\nof common rows and common columns for pairs of matrices achieving this value.\nWe discover numerically an intriguing phase transition at $\\alpha^*\\approx\n1.3608..$: when $\\alpha<\\alpha^*$ the space of overlaps is a continuous subset\nof $[0,1]^2$, whereas $\\alpha=\\alpha^*$ marks the onset of discontinuity, and\nthe model exhibits the Overlap Gap Property when $\\alpha>\\alpha^*$. We\nconjecture that $\\alpha>\\alpha^*$ marks the onset of the algorithmic hardness.\n", "  A nonlinear coupled Choi-Camassa model describing one-dimensional\nincompressible motion of two non-mixing fluid layers in a horizontal channel\nhas been derived in Ref.1. An equivalence transformation is presented, leading\nto a special dimensionless form of the system, with the number of constant\nphysical parameters reduced from five to one. A first-order dimensionless\nordinary differential equation describing traveling wave solutions is analyzed.\nSeveral multi-parameter families of exact closed-form solutions of the\nChoi-Camassa model are obtained, describing periodic, solitary, and kink-type\nbidirectional traveling waves.\n", "  Hydrodynamics of plasma in the random magnetic field is considered, which is\ncharacterized by the second moment of magnetic induction. Equations of ideal\nmagnetic hydrodynamics in such field are received for an adiabatic process. It\nis shown that in Euler Equation a new variable is second moment of magnetic\ninduction enters, for which is received time Equation on the basis of Maxwell\nEquations in the magnetohydrodynamic approximation. The one dimension plane\nwaves in this system are studied and the values of their phase velocities are\nreceived.\n", "  Detectors proposed for the International Linear Collider (ILC) incorporate a\ntungsten sampling calorimeter (`BeamCal') intended to reconstruct showers of\nelectrons, positrons and photons that emerge from the interaction point of the\ncollider with angles between 5 and 50 milliradians. For the innermost radius of\nthis calorimeter, radiation doses at shower max are expected to reach 100 Mrad\nper year, primarily due to minimum-ionizing electrons and positrons that arise\nin the induced electromagnetic showers of e+e- `beamstrahlung' pairs produced\nin the ILC beam-beam interaction. However, radiation damage to calorimeter\nsensors may be dominated by hadrons induced by nuclear interactions of shower\nphotons, which are much more likely to contribute to the non-ionizing energy\nloss that has been observed to damage sensors exposed to hadronic radiation. We\nreport here on the results of SLAC Experiment T-506, for which several\ndifferent types of silicon diode and gallium-arsenide sensors were exposed to\ndoses of radiation induced by showering electrons of energy 3.5-13.3 GeV. By\nembedding the sensor under irradiation within a tungsten radiator, the exposure\nincorporated hadronic species that would potentially contribute to the\ndegradation of a sensor mounted in a precision sampling calorimeter. Depending\non sensor technology, efficient charge collection was observed for doses as\nlarge as 270 Mrad.\n", "  We report the temperature-dependent complex dielectric function of pristine\nbulk SrTiO$_3$ between 4.2 and 300 K within the energy range of 0.6-6.5 eV\ndetermined by spectroscopic ellipsometry. Fundamental indirect and direct\nband-gap energies have been extracted and are discussed with regard to existing\nstate-of-the-art theoretical calculations. Furthermore, the dielectric function\naround the fundamental direct gap is analyzed by considering excitonic states.\nThe excitonic effects, including the Coulomb enhancement of the continuum, are\ncharacterized using an extension of the Elliott's formula considering both the\nreal and imaginary parts of the dielectric function. The Urbach tail below the\nindirect edge shows an unconventional temperature-dependent behavior correlated\nto the microstructural changes near the structural phase transition around 105\nK from the low-temperature tetragonal phase to the cubic phase. The\ntemperature-dependent characterization reveals that the fundamental indirect\nedge as well as the Urbach tail are affected conspicuously by the structural\nphase transition while the fundamental direct edge is not. Moreover, the\nindirect edge follows Varshni's rule only in the cubic phase and the direct\nedge exhibits an anomalous linear increase with increasing temperature.\n", "  Dynamics of solitons is considered in an extended nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger\nequation, including a pseudo-stimulated-Raman-scattering (pseudo-SRS) term\n(scattering on damping low-frequency waves, third-order dispersion (TOD) and\ninhomogeneity of the spatial second-order dispersion (SOD). It is shown that\nwave-number downshift by the pseudo-SRS may be compensated by upshift provided\nby spatially increasing SOD with taking into account TOD. The equilibrium state\nis stable for positive parameter of TOD and unstable for negative one. The\nanalytical solutions are verified by comparison with numerical results\n", "  We discuss a mathematical model of migration channel based on the truncated\nWaring distribution. The truncated Waring distribution is obtained for a more\ngeneral model of motion of substance through a channel containing finite number\nof boxes. The model is applied then for case of migrants moving through a\nchannel consisting of finite number of countries or cities. The number of\nmigrants in the channel strongly depends on the number of migrants that enter\nthe channel through the country of entrance. It is shown that if the final\ndestination country is very popular then large percentage of migrants may\nconcentrate there.\n", "  B and L violating interactions of ordinary particles with their twin\nparticles from hypothetical mirror world can co-generate baryon asymmetries in\nboth worlds in comparable amounts, $\\Omega'_B/\\Omega_B \\sim 5$ or so. On the\nother hand, the same interactions induce the oscillation phenomena between the\nneutral particles of two sectors which convert e.g. mirror neutrons into our\nantineutrons. These oscillations are environment dependent and can have\nfascinating physical consequences.\n", "  The ground state cooling of a mechanical oscillator in an optomechanical\ncavity containing an ensemble of identical two-level ground-state atoms is\nstudied in the highly unresolved-sideband regime. The system exhibits\nelectromagnetically-induced transparency-like quantum interference effect. The\nmutual interaction with the cavity optical field gives rise to an indirect\ncoupling between the atomic and mechanical modes. In presence of this\ninteraction, the noise spectrum gets modified and leads to asymmetric cooling\nand heating rates. Using the quantum master equation, time evolution of the\naverage phonon number is studied and it is observed that the average phonon\noccupancy in the mechanical resonator exhibits ground-state cooling.\n", "  We numerically analyse extraordinary terahertz transmission properties of an\narray of rectangular shaped apertures perforated periodically on a thin metal\nfilm. The apertures are tapered at different angles to achieve higher field\nconcentration at the tapered end. The periodic sub-wavelength scale apertures\nensure plasmonic behaviour giving rise to the enhanced transmission of a\nspecific frequency mode decided by the periodicity. We compare results of\ntransmission with the rectangular shaped apertures of same parameters and\nobserve a significant increase in the transmission for the tapered case. We\nhave compared results of our numerical simulations with theory and have found\nthem consistent.\n", "  We present an electronic transport experiment in graphene where both\nclassical and quantum mechanical charge detector back-action on a quantum dot\nare investigated. The device consists of two stacked graphene quantum dots\nseparated by a thin layer of boron nitride. This device is fabricated by van\nder Waals stacking and is equipped with separate source and drain contacts to\nboth dots. By applying a finite bias to one quantum dot, a current is induced\nin the other unbiased dot. We present an explanation of the observed\nmeasurement-induced current based on strong capacitive coupling and energy\ndependent tunneling barriers, breaking the spatial symmetry in the unbiased\nsystem. This is a special feature of graphene-based quantum devices. The\nexperimental observation of transport in classically forbidden regimes is\nunderstood by considering higher order quantum mechanical back-action\nmechanisms.\n", "  Some differences between theoretical, numerical and observational\ndeterminations of spectral slopes of solar wind turbulence are interpreted in\nthe thermodynamical sense. Confirmations of turbulent Kolmogorov slopes in\nsolar wind magnetic turbulence and magnetohydrodynamic simulations exhibit tiny\ndifferences. These are used to infer about entropy generation in the turbulent\ncascade and to infer about the anomalous turbulent collision frequency in the\ndissipative range as well as the average energy input in solar wind turbulence.\nAnomalous turbulent collision frequencies are obtained of the order of v < 200\nHz. The corresponding stationary solar wind magnetic energy input into magnetic\nturbulence in the Kolmogorov inertial range is obtained to be of the order of\n50 eV/s. Its thermal fate is discussed.\n", "  We prove the presence of chaos near a homoclinic orbit in the modified\nLi-Yorke sense [10] by implementing chaotic perturbations. A Duffing oscillator\nis considered to show the effectiveness of our technique, and simulations that\nsupport the theoretical results are depicted. Ott-Grebogi-Yorke and Pyragas\ncontrol methods are used to stabilize almost periodic motions.\n", "  A system's apparent simplicity depends on whether it is represented\nclassically or quantally. This is not so surprising, as classical and quantum\nphysics are descriptive frameworks built on different assumptions that capture,\nemphasize, and express different properties and mechanisms. What is surprising\nis that, as we demonstrate, simplicity is ambiguous: the relative simplicity\nbetween two systems can change sign when moving between classical and quantum\ndescriptions. Thus, notions of absolute physical simplicity---minimal structure\nor memory---at best form a partial, not a total, order. This suggests that\nappeals to principles of physical simplicity, via Ockham's Razor or to the\n\"elegance\" of competing theories, may be fundamentally subjective, perhaps even\nbeyond the purview of physics itself. It also raises challenging questions in\nmodel selection between classical and quantum descriptions. Fortunately,\nexperiments are now beginning to probe measures of simplicity, creating the\npotential to directly test for ambiguity.\n", "  Implementation of cognitive apprenticeship in an introductory physics lab\ngroup problem solving exercise may be mitigated by epistemic views toward\nphysics of non-physics science majors. Quantitative pre-post data of the Force\nConcept Inventory (FCI) and Colorado Learning Attitudes About Science Survey\n(CLASS) of 39 students of a first-semester algebra-based introductory physics\ncourse, while describing typical results for a traditional-format course\noverall (g = +0.14), suggest differences in epistemic views between health\nscience majors and life science majors which may correlate with differences in\npre-post conceptual understanding. Audiovisual data of student lab groups\nworking on a context-rich problem and students' written reflections described\neach group's typical dynamics and invoked epistemic games. We examined the\neffects of framework-based orientation (favored by biology majors) and\nperformance-based orientation (favored by computer science, chemistry, and\nhealth science majors) on pre-post attitude survey performance. We also\ninvestigated possible correlations of these orientations with individual\nquantitative survey results, and with qualitative audiovisual data of lab\ngroups' choice of epistemic games.\n", "  We present the pseudo-$\\epsilon$ expansions ($\\tau$-series) for the critical\nexponents of a $\\lambda\\phi^4$ three-dimensional $O(n)$-symmetric model\nobtained on the basis of six-loop renormalization-group expansions. Concrete\nnumerical results are presented for physically interesting cases $n = 1$, $n =\n2$, $n = 3$ and $n = 0$, as well as for $4 \\le n \\le 32$ in order to clarify\nthe general properties of the obtained series. The pseudo-$\\epsilon$-expansions\nfor the exponents $\\gamma$ and $\\alpha$ have small and rapidly decreasing\ncoefficients. So, even the direct summation of the $\\tau$-series leads to fair\nestimates for critical exponents, while addressing Pade approximants enables\none to get high-precision numerical results. In contrast, the coefficients of\nthe pseudo-$\\epsilon$ expansion of the scaling correction exponent $\\omega$ do\nnot exhibit any tendency to decrease at physical values of $n$. But the\ncorresponding series are sign-alternating, and to obtain reliable numerical\nestimates, it also suffices to use simple Pad\\'e approximants in this case. The\npseudo-$\\epsilon$ expansion technique can therefore be regarded as a specific\nresummation method converting divergent renormalization-group series into\nexpansions that are computationally convenient.\n", "  Utilizing continues-wave or pulsed laser to induce nano-structures on various\nmaterial surfaces is one significant method in nano-fabrication technology. In\nthis report, we investigate the formation of high spatial frequency periodic\nstructures on Polyvinyl Pyrrolidone (PVP) film by a linearly polarized\nfemtosecond laser. Ferric (Fe) ions are introduced into the film to improve the\nphotosensitivity. Regular nano-gratings with spatial periods at the range of\n60-100nm, which are about one tenth of the irradiating wavelength, can be\ninduced. The period direction of the nano-gratings is perpendicular to the\npolarization of the femtosecond laser. By tuning the laser energy and scanning\nspeed, we find that the nano-gratings can be formed in a wide range of\nexperimental parameters. As high laser energy can excite not only metals, but\nalso semiconductors and polymers, we believe the formation of the nano-gratings\nis due to the interaction between the incident femtosecond laser and surface\nplasmons. The laser processable PVP-based materials and the induced\nnano-gratings will have potential applications in biophotonics and\nnanophotonics.\n", "  Classical models of biological invasions assess species spread in homogeneous\nlandscapes by assuming constant growth rates and random local movement.\nMounting evidence suggests, however, that demographic stochasticity,\nenvironmental heterogeneity and non-random movement of individuals affect\nconsiderably the spread dynamics. Here, we show that the dynamics of biological\ninvasions are controlled by the spatial heterogeneity of the resource\ndistribution. We show theoretically that increasing the landscape resource\nautocorrelation length causes a reduction in the average speed of species\nspread. Demographic stochasticity plays a key role in the slowdown, which is\nstreghtened when individuals can actively move towards resources. The reduction\nin the front propagation speed is verified in laboratory microcosm experiments\nwith the flagellated protist Euglena gracilis by comparing spread in habitats\ncharacterized by different resource heterogeneity. Our theoretical and\nexperimental findings highlight the need to account for the intrinsic\nstochasticity of population dynamics to describe spread in spatially extended\nlandscapes, which are inevitably characterized by heterogeneous spatial\ndistributions of resources controlling vital rates. Our work identifies the\nresource autocorrelation length as a key modulator and a simple measure of\nlandscape susceptibility to biological invasions, with implications for\npredicting the characters of biological invasions within naturally\nheterogeneous environmental corridors.\n", "  We study combinatorial Dyson Schwinger equations, expressed in the Hopf\nalgebra of words with a quasi shuffle product. We map them into an algebra of\npolynomials in one indeterminate L and show that the leading log expansion one\nobtains with such a mapping are simple power law like expression\n", "  Earlier electron influence on sound absorption in metal on basis of the\nassumption of deformation of Fermi-surfaces under the influence of a sound wave\nwas considered. In the present work other approach to this problem will be\nconsidered. Our approach based on the account of dynamic (kinetic) interaction\nof electronic gas with lattice fluctuations. The analysis of influence of\nelectric field on process of attenuation of sound fluctuations is carried out.\nIt is shown that in the long-wave limit this influence is essential.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to define and study Yetter-Drinfeld modules over\nweak Hom-Hopf algebras. We show that the category ${}_H{\\cal WYD}^H$ of\nYetter-Drinfeld modules with bijective structure maps over weak Hom-Hopf\nalgebras is a rigid category and a braided monoidal category, and obtain a new\nsolution of quantum Hom-Yang-Baxter equation. It turns out that, If $H$ is\nquasitriangular (respectively, coquasitriangular)weak Hom-Hopf algebras, the\ncategory of modules (respectively, comodules) with bijective structure maps\nover $H$ is a braided monoidal subcategory of the category ${}_H{\\cal WYD}^H$\nof Yetter-Drinfeld modules over weak Hom-Hopf algebras.\n", "  We comment on the ubiquity of the so-called warped anti-de Sitter spacetimes\nin three-dimensional (2,0) supergravity theory. By using isometry-invariant\ntensors and simple counting, we prove their existence for arbitrary $(2,0)$\nsupergravity models suitably defined close to a minimal model. We also analyze\ntheir offshell supersymmetry and the supersymmetry of two geometric orbifolds.\n", "  We show that for nanoparticles with giant polarizability $\\alpha$ (a\nprominent example being the recently studied Na$_{14}$F$_{13}$ molecular\nclusters) van der Waals forces are significantly enhanced at interparticle\ndistances shorter than $R_0=(\\alpha/2\\pi\\epsilon_0)^{1/3}$. For an adequate\ndescription of this phenomenon, nonlinear effects must be taken into account.\nWe show that, contrary to some theoretical claims, an accurate treatment of\nnonlinearity does not lead to any repulsive forces.\n", "  Parity-time (PT) symmetry is of great interest. The reciprocal and\nunidirectional features are intriguing besides the PT symmetry phase\ntransition. Recently, the reciprocal transmission, unidirectional\nreflectionless and invisibility are intensively studied. Here, we show the\nreciprocal reflection/transmission in PT -symmetric system is closely related\nto the type of PT symmetry, that is, the axial (reflection) PT symmetry leads\nto reciprocal reflection (transmission). The results are further elucidated by\nstudying the scattering of rhombic ring form coupled resonators with enclosed\nsynthetic magnetic flux. The nonreciprocal phase shift induced by the magnetic\nflux and gain/loss break the parity (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetry but keep\nthe parity-time (PT) symmetry. The reciprocal reflection (transmission) and\nunidirectional transmission (reflection) are found in the axial (reflection)\nPT-symmetric ring center. The explorations of symmetry and asymmetry from PT\nsymmetry may shed light on novel one-way optical devices and application of PT\nmetamaterials.\n", "  Using the Jordan-Schwinger form of the quantum angular momentum eigenstates,\nit is straight-forward to define rotational correlation tables such that the\ncolumns are Molien sequences for finite rotational subgroup $G$. This\nrealization gives a new and better means of calculation. Generalization to\nunitary symmetry $U(n)$ implies many more sequences, which determine degeneracy\nobservables in the context of electronic, vibrational, and rotational motion.\nThis leads us to discuss one physical significance of the Hilbert finite basis\ntheorem.\n", "  With inspiration from the classic study by Chi, Feltovich, and Glaser [1], we\nasked introductory physics students in three introductory physics classes to\ncategorize mechanics problems based upon similarity of solutions. To evaluate\nthe effect of problem context on students' ability to categorize, two sets of\nproblems were developed for categorization. Some problems in one of the problem\nsets that students were asked to categorize included those available from the\nprior study by Chi et al. Our findings, which contrast from those of Chi et\nal., suggest that there is a much wider distribution of expertise among\nintroductory students.\n", "  The ability to categorize problems based upon underlying principles, rather\nthan surface features or contexts, is considered one of several proxy\npredictors of expertise in problem solving. With inspiration from the classic\nstudy by Chi, Feltovich, and Glaser, we assess the distribution of expertise\namong introductory physics students by asking three introductory physics\nclasses, each with more than a hundred students, to categorize mechanics\nproblems based upon similarity of solution. We compare their categorization\nwith those of physics graduate students and faculty members. To evaluate the\neffect of problem context on students' ability to categorize, two sets of\nproblems were developed for categorization. Some problems in one set included\nthose available from the prior study by Chi et al. We find a large overlap\nbetween calculus-based introductory students and graduate students with regard\nto their categorizations that were assessed as \"good.\" Our findings, which\ncontrast with those of Chi et al., suggest that there is a wide distribution of\nexpertise in mechanics among introductory and graduate students. Although the\ncategorization task is conceptual, introductory students in the calculus-based\ncourse performed better than those in the algebra-based course. Qualitative\ntrends in categorization of problems are similar between the non-Chi problems\nand problems available from the Chi study used in our study although the Chi\nproblems used are more difficult on average.\n", "  IV-VI diluted magnetic semiconductor Ge1-xCrxTe layers up to x=0.1 were grown\non SrF2 substrates by molecular beam epitaxy. In site reflection high-energy\nelectron diffraction shows a streaky pattern with sixfold symmetry in the plane\nfor the Ge1-xCrxTe layer, implying an epitaxial growth of Ge1-xCrxTe [111]/SrF2\n[111]. A clear hysteresis loop is observed in the anomalous Hall effect\nmeasurements due to the strong spin-orbit interaction in the host GeTe. The\nCurie temperature increases with increasing Cr composition up to 200 K, but\nthere is no clear dependence of the Curie temperature on the hole\nconcentration, implying that the mechanism of the ferromagnetic interaction\namong Cr ions is different from Mn doped diluted magnetic semiconductors.\n", "  We theoretically and experimentally investigate the optical absorption\nproperties of heterostructures composed of graphene films and truncated\nphotonic crystals (PCs) in the visible range. The experimental results show\nthat the absorption of the heterostructure is enhanced greatly in the whole\nforbidden gap of PCs compared with that of graphene alone. The absorption is\nenhanced over a wide angle of incidence for both transverse electric (TE) and\ntransverse magnetic (TM) polarizations. The enhanced absorption band broadens\nfor TE polarization but narrows for TM polarization as the incident angle\nincreases. In the forbidden gap of the PCs, the maximum absorptance of the\nheterostructures is nearly four times of that of bare graphene films for\narbitrary incident angles and polarizations. The optical experiments are in\nexcellent agreement with the theoretical results.\n", "  A new air-shower core-detector array (YAC : Yangbajing Air-shower\nCore-detector array) has been developed to measure the primary cosmic-ray\ncomposition at the \"knee\" energies in Tibet, China, focusing mainly on the\nlight components. The prototype experiment (YAC-I) consisting of 16 detectors\nhas been constructed and operated at Yangbajing (4300 m a.s.l.) in Tibet since\nMay 2009. YAC-I is installed in the Tibet-III AS array and operates together.\nIn this paper, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation to check the sensitivity\nof YAC-I+Tibet-III array to the cosmic-ray light component of cosmic rays\naround the knee energies, taking account of the observation conditions of\nactual YAC-I+Tibet-III array. The selection of light component from others was\nmade by use of an artificial neural network (ANN). The simulation shows that\nthe light-component spectrum estimated by our methods can well reproduce the\ninput ones within 10\\% error, and there will be about 30\\% systematic errors\nmostly induced by the primary and interaction models used. It is found that the\nfull-scale YAC and the Tibet-III array is powerful to study the cosmic-ray\ncomposition, in particular, to obtain the energy spectra of protons and helium\nnuclei around the knee energies.\n", "  Shortcut to Adiabatic Passage (SHAPE) technique, in the context of coherent\ncontrol of atomic systems has gained considerable attention in last few years.\nIt is primarily because of its ability to manipulate population among the\nquantum states infinitely fast compared to the adiabatic processes. Two methods\nin this regard have been explored rigorously, namely the transitionless quantum\ndriving and the Lewis-Reisenfeld invariant approach. We have applied these two\nmethods to realize SHAPE in adiabatic waveguide coupler. Waveguide couplers are\nintegral components of photonic circuits, primarily used as switching devices.\nOur study shows that with appropriate engineering of the coupling coefficient\nand propagation constants of the coupler it is possible to achieve efficient\nand complete power switching. We also observed that the coupler length could be\nreduced significantly without affecting the coupling efficiency of the system.\n", "  We consider the family of gapped Hamiltonians introduced in [FNW] on the\nquantum spin chains $\\bigotimes_{\\mathbb Z}\\mathop{\\mathrm{M}}\\nolimits_n$,\nwith local symmetry given by a group $G$. The $G$-symmetric gapped Hamiltonians\nare given by triples $(k,u,V)$, where $u$ is a projective unitary\nrepresentation of $G$ on a finite dimensional space ${\\mathbb C}^k$, and $V$ is\nan isometry from ${\\mathbb C}^k$ to ${\\mathbb C}^n\\otimes {\\mathbb C}^k$. We\nshow that Hamiltonians $H_0,H_1$, given by the triples\n  $(k^{(0)}, u^{(0)}, V^{(0)})$ and $(k^{(1)}, u^{(1)}, V^{(1)})$ are\n$C^1$-equivalent if the projective representations $u^{(0)}$ and $u^{(1)}$ are\nunitary equivalent.\n", "  While metamaterials are often desirable for near-field functions, such as\nperfect lensing, or cloaking, they are often quantified by their response to\nplane waves from the far field. Here, we present a theoretical analysis of the\nlocal density of states near lattices of discrete magnetic scatterers, i.e.,\nthe response to near field excitation by a point source. Based on a\npoint-dipole theory using Ewald summation and an array scanning method, we can\nswiftly and semi-analytically evaluate the local density of states (LDOS) for\nmagnetoelectric point sources in front of an infinite two-dimensional (2D)\nlattice composed of arbitrary magnetoelectric dipole scatterers. The method\ntakes into account radiation damping as well as all retarded electrodynamic\ninteractions in a self-consistent manner. We show that a lattice of magnetic\nscatterers evidences characteristic Drexhage oscillations. However, the\noscillations are phase shifted relative to the electrically scattering lattice\nconsistent with the difference expected for reflection off homogeneous magnetic\nrespectively electric mirrors. Furthermore, we identify in which source-surface\nseparation regimes the metasurface may be treated as a homogeneous interface,\nand in which homogenization fails. A strong frequency and in-plane position\ndependence of the LDOS close to the lattice reveals coupling to guided modes\nsupported by the lattice.\n", "  Low-frequency radio arrays are opening a new window for the study of the sky,\nboth to study new phenomena and to better characterize known source classes.\nBeing flat-spectrum sources, blazars are so far poorly studied at low radio\nfrequencies.\n  We characterize the spectral properties of the blazar population at low radio\nfrequency compare the radio and high-energy properties of the gamma-ray blazar\npopulation, and search for radio counterparts of unidentified gamma-ray\nsources.\n  We cross-correlated the 6,100 deg^2 Murchison Widefield Array Commissioning\nSurvey catalogue with the Roma blazar catalogue, the third catalogue of active\ngalactic nuclei detected by Fermi-LAT, and the unidentified members of the\nentire third catalogue of gamma-ray sources detected by \\fermilat. When\navailable, we also added high-frequency radio data from the Australia Telescope\n20 GHz catalogue.\n  We find low-frequency counterparts for 186 out of 517 (36%) blazars, 79 out\nof 174 (45%) gamma-ray blazars, and 8 out of 73 (11%) gamma-ray blazar\ncandidates. The mean low-frequency (120--180 MHz) blazar spectral index is\n$\\langle \\alpha_\\mathrm{low} \\rangle=0.57\\pm0.02$: blazar spectra are flatter\nthan the rest of the population of low-frequency sources, but are steeper than\nat $\\sim$GHz frequencies. Low-frequency radio flux density and gamma-ray energy\nflux display a mildly significant and broadly scattered correlation. Ten\nunidentified gamma-ray sources have a (probably fortuitous) positional match\nwith low radio frequency sources.\n  Low-frequency radio astronomy provides important information about sources\nwith a flat radio spectrum and high energy. However, the relatively low\nsensitivity of the present surveys still misses a significant fraction of these\nobjects. Upcoming deeper surveys, such as the GaLactic and Extragalactic\nAll-Sky MWA (GLEAM) survey, will provide further insight into this population.\n", "  We calculate the ground, first intrinsic excited states and density\ndistribution for neutron-rich thorium and uranium isotopes, within the\nframework of relativistic mean field(RMF) approach using axially deformed\nbasis. The total nucleon densities are calculated, from which the\ncluster-structures inside the parent nuclei are determined. The possible modes\nof decay, like {\\alpha}-decay and \\b{eta} -decay are analyzed. We find the\nneutron-rich isotopes are stable against {\\alpha}-decay, however they are very\nmuch unstable against \\b{eta} -decay. The life time of these nuclei predicted\nto be tens of second against \\b{eta} -decay.\n", "  We report on the development and characterization of a medium resolution\nmonochromator for synchrotron-based hyperfine spectroscopy at the 73 keV\nnuclear resonance of 193-Ir. The device provides high throughput of 6*10^8 ph/s\nin an energy bandwidth of 300(20) meV. We excited the nuclear resonance in\n193-Ir at 73.04 keV and observed nuclear fluorescence of 193-Ir in Iridium\nmetal. The monochromator allows for Nuclear Forward Scattering spectroscopy on\nIr and its compounds.\n", "  We develop an abstract method to identify spectral points of definite type in\nthe spectrum of the operator $T_1\\otimes I_2 + I_1\\otimes T_2$. The method is\napplicable in particular for non-self-adjoint waveguide type operators with\nsymmetries. Using the remarkable properties of the spectral points of definite\ntype, we obtain new results on realness of weakly coupled bound states and of\nlow lying essential spectrum in the $\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{T}$-symmetric\nwaveguide. Moreover, we show that the pseudospectrum has a normal tame behavior\nnear the low lying essential spectrum and exclude the accumulation of non-real\neigenvalues to this part of the essential spectrum. The advantage of our\napproach is particularly visible when the resolvent of the unperturbed operator\ncannot be explicitly expressed and most of the mentioned spectral conclusions\nare extremely hard to prove using direct methods.\n", "  Organic semiconductors offer an unprecedented flexibility to control the\nelectronic state of interfacial electronic systems. Here we present a first\nstep in realizing organic charge transfer interfaces that combine both a large\nelectrical conductivity and the presence of magnetic ions. We have performed a\ndetailed investigation of F16CoPc/rubrene interface by means of temperature\ndependent charge transport measurements, Hall effect, scanning Kelvin probe\nmicroscopy and photoelectron spectroscopy. Our finding is that the charge\ntransfer leads to significantly enhanced electrical conductivity and the\nband-like transport. We have determined the density, mobility and nature of\ncharge carriers in the system (holes in rubrene). We have also found that the\namount of charge transfer in F16CoPc/rubrene is high enough to cause the\nband-like transport in rubrene crystals at the interface. Finally, our XPS and\nUPS measurements have shown that the charge transfer in F16CoPc/rubrene\ninvolves electronic orbitals centered on the magnetic Co ions of the\nphthalocyanine molecules causing a change in their spin. Thus, F16CoPc/rubrene\nis the first organic interface where the charge transfer responsible for the\ninterfacial conductivity fully involves the metal Co core of the phthalocyanine\nmolecules, providing a link between charge transport and magnetic properties.\n", "  We study the effects of isovector-scalar ($\\delta$)-meson on neutron star.\nInfluence of $\\delta$-meson on both static and rotating neutron star is\ndiscussed. Inclusion of $\\delta$-meson in a neutron star system consisting of\nproton, neutron and electron, make the equation of state stiffer in higher\ndensity and consequently increases the maximum mass of the star. But induction\nof $\\delta$-meson in the hyperon star decreases the maximum mass of the hyperon\nstar. This is due to the early evolution of hyperons in presence of\n$\\delta-$meson.\n", "  We demonstrate that four-wave mixing processes in high-quality non-linear\nresonators can lead to Rabi-like oscillations in photon occupation numbers and\nsecond-order correlation functions, being a characteristic feature of the\npresence of entangled photon pairs in the optical signal. In the case of a\nsystem driven by a continuous coherent pump, the oscillations occur in the\ntransient regime. We show that driving the system with pulsed coherent pumping\nwould generate strongly anti-bunched photon states.\n", "  An overview is given of recent advances in experimental and theoretical\nunderstanding of optical properties of ultra-thin crystal structures (graphene,\nphosphorene, silicene, MoS2, MoSe2 , WS2 , WSe2 , h-AlN, h-BN, fluorographene,\ngraphane). Ultra-thin crystals are atomically-thick layered crystals that have\nunique properties which differ from their 3D counterpart. Because of the\ndifficulties in the synthesis of few-atom-thick crystal structures, which are\nthought to be the main building blocks of future nanotechnology, reliable\ntheoretical predictions of their electronic, vibrational and optical properties\nare of great importance. Recent studies revealed the reliable predictive power\nof existing theoretical approaches based on density functional theory (DFT).\n", "  We investigate the inflationary universe in a theory where two scalar fields\nnon-minimally coupling to the scalar curvature and an extra $R^2$ term exist\nand the conformal invariance is broken. In particular, the slow-roll inflation\nis explored for the case that one scalar field is dynamical and that two scalar\nfields are dynamical. As a result, we show that the spectral index of the\ncurvature perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio of the density\nperturbations can be compatible with the Planck results. It is also\ndemonstrated that the graceful exit from inflation can be realized.\n", "  The $SU(3)$ meson exchange approach to interactions within the baryon octet\nand nuclear density functional theory are used to derive an \\emph{ab initio}\ndescription of hypernuclear interactions. The density dependence of\ninteractions is recast into a DFT with density dependent interaction vertices.\nThe field-theoretical structure is retained by expressing the vertices as\nfunctionals of the matter field operators. Applications to infinite hypermatter\nand neutron star matter are discussed. A new approach is presented allowing to\ndetermine in-medium coupling constants out of the $NN$-vertex functionals,\nobtained e.g. by DBHF theory, for the full baryon octet by exploiting $SU(3)$\nrelations.\n", "  Determining sensor parameters is a prerequisite for quantitative force\nmeasurement. Here we report a direct, high-precision calibration method for\nquartz tuning fork(TF) sensors that are popular in the feld of nanomechanical\nmeasurement. In the method, conservative and dissipative forces with controlled\namplitudes are applied to one prong of TF directly to mimic the tip-sample\ninteraction, and the responses of the sensor are measured at the same time to\nextract sensor parameters. The method, for the frst time, allows force gradient\nand damping coeffcient which correspond to the conservative and dissipative\ninteractions to be measured simultaneously. The calibration result shows\nsurprisingly that, unlike cantilevers, the frequency shift for TFs depends on\nboth the conservative and dissipative forces, which may be ascribed to the\ncomplex dynamics. The effectiveness of the method is testifed by force spectrum\nmeasurement with a calibrated TF. The method is generic for all kinds of\nsensors used for non-contact atomic force microscopy(NC-AFM) and is an\nimportant improvement for quantitative nanomechanical measurement.\n", "  We show that the ability to make direct measurements of momentum, in addition\nto the usual direct measurements of position, allows a simple configuration of\ntwo identical mechanical oscillators to be used for broadband back-action-free\nforce metrology. This would eliminate the need for an optical reference\noscillator in the scheme of Tsang and Caves [Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 123601\n(2010)], along with its associated disadvantages. We also show that if one is\nrestricted to position measurements alone then two copies of the same\ntwo-oscillator configuration can be used for narrow-band back-action-free force\nmetrology.\n", "  Substantial progress has been achieved over the last decade in studies of\nstellar magnetism due to the improvement of magnetic field measurement methods.\nWe review recent results on the magnetic field characteristics of early B- and\nO-type stars obtained by various teams using different measurement techniques.\n", "  Fulfillment of the promise of transparent electronics has been hindered until\nnow largely by the lack of semiconductors that can be doped p-type in a stable\nway, and that at the same time present high hole mobility and are highly\ntransparent in the visible spectrum. Here, a high-throughput study based on\nfirst-principles methods reveals four oxides, namely X2SeO2, with X = La, Pr,\nNd, and Gd, which are unique in that they exhibit excellent characteristics for\ntransparent electronic device applications-i.e., a direct band gap larger than\n3.1 eV, an average hole effective mass below the electron rest mass, and good\np-type dopability. Furthermore, for La2SeO2 it is explicitly shown that Na\nimpurities substituting La are shallow acceptors in moderate to strong\nanion-rich growth conditions, with low formation energy, and that they will not\nbe compensated by anion vacancies VO or VSe.\n", "  Graphical languages offer intuitive and rigorous formalisms for quantum\nphysics. They can be used to simplify expressions, derive equalities, and do\ncomputations. Yet in order to replace conventional formalisms, rigour alone is\nnot sufficient: the new formalisms also need to have equivalent deductive\npower. This requirement is captured by the property of completeness, which\nmeans that any equality that can be derived using some standard formalism can\nalso be derived graphically.\n  In this thesis, I consider the ZX-calculus, a graphical language for pure\nstate qubit quantum mechanics. I show that it is complete for pure state\nstabilizer quantum mechanics, so any problem within this fragment of quantum\ntheory can be fully analysed using graphical methods. This includes questions\nof central importance in areas such as error-correcting codes or\nmeasurement-based quantum computation. Furthermore, I show that the ZX-calculus\nis complete for the single-qubit Clifford+T group, which is approximately\nuniversal: any single-qubit unitary can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy\nusing only Clifford gates and the T-gate. [...] Lastly, I extend the use of\nrigorous graphical languages outside quantum theory to Spekkens' toy theory, a\nlocal hidden variable model that nevertheless exhibits some features commonly\nassociated with quantum mechanics. [...] I develop a graphical calculus similar\nto the ZX-calculus that fully describes Spekkens' toy theory, and show that it\nis complete. Hence, stabilizer quantum mechanics and Spekkens' toy theory can\nbe fully analysed and compared using graphical formalisms.\n  Intuitive graphical languages can replace conventional formalisms for the\nanalysis of many questions in quantum computation and foundations without loss\nof mathematical rigour or deductive power.\n", "  Although the socket is critical in a prosthetic system for a person with limb\namputation, the methods of its design are largely artisanal. A roadblock for a\nrepeatable and quantitative socket design process is the lack of predictive and\npatient specific biomechanical models of the residuum. This study presents the\nevaluation of such a model using a combined experimental-numerical approach.\nThe model geometry and tissue boundaries are derived from MRI. The soft tissue\nnon-linear elastic and viscoelastic mechanical behavior was evaluated using\ninverse finite element analysis (FEA) of in-vivo indentation experiments. A\ncustom designed robotic in-vivo indentation system was used to provide a rich\nexperimental data set of force versus time at 18 sites across a limb. During\nFEA, the tissues were represented by two layers, namely the skin-adipose layer\nand an underlying muscle-soft tissue complex. The non-linear elastic behavior\nwas modeled using 2nd order Ogden hyperelastic formulations, and\nviscoelasticity was modeled using the quasi-linear theory of viscoelasticity.\nTo determine the material parameters for each tissue, an inverse FEA based\noptimization routine was used that minimizes the combined mean of the squared\nforce differences between the numerical and experimental force-time curves for\nindentations at 4 distinct anatomical regions on the residuum. The optimization\nprovided the following material parameters for the skin-adipose layer: c=5.22\nkPa, m=4.79, gamma=3.57 MPa, tau=0.32 s and for the muscle-soft tissue complex:\nc=5.20 kPa, m=4.78, gamma=3.47 MPa, tau=0.34 s. These parameters were evaluated\nto predict the force-time curves for the remaining 14 anatomical locations. The\nmean percentage error (mean absolute error/ maximum experimental force) for\nthese predictions was 7 +/- 3%. The mean percentage error at the 4 sites used\nfor the optimization was 4%.\n", "  Searches for Beyond the Standard Model Higgs processes in the context of\nMinimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and Next to MSSM are presented. The\nresults are based on the first LHC run of pp collision data recorded by the\nATLAS and CMS experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider at centre-of-mass\nenergies of 7 and 8 TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of about 5\nand 20 fb$^{-1}$ respectively. Current searches constrain large parts of the\nparameter space. No evidence for BSM Higgs is found.\n", "  Epidemiological geographic profiling is a statistical method for making\ninferences about likely areas of a source from the geographical distribution of\npatients. Epidemiological geographic profiling algorithms are developed to\nlocate a source from the dataset on the number of new cases for a\nmeta-population network model. It is found from the WHO dataset on the SARS\noutbreak that Hong Kong remains the most likely source throughout the period of\nobservation. This reasoning is pertinent under the restricted circumstance that\nthe number of reported probable cases in China was missing, unreliable, and\nincomprehensive. It may also imply that globally connected Hong Kong was more\ninfluential as a spreader than China. Singapore, Taiwan, Canada, and the United\nStates follow Hong Kong in the likeliness ranking list.\n", "  This paper has investigated the growth pattern of traffic oscillations by\nusing vehicle trajectory data in a car following experiment. We measured the\nstandard deviation of acceleration, emission and fuel consumption of each\nvehicle in the car-following platoon. We found that: (1) Similar to the\nstandard deviation of speed, these indices exhibit a common feature of concave\ngrowth pattern along vehicles in the platoon; (2) The emission and fuel\nconsumption of each vehicle decrease remarkably when the average speed of the\nplatoon increases from low value; However, when reaches 30km/h, the change of\nemission and fuel consumption with is not so significant; (3), the correlations\nof emission and fuel consumption with both the standard deviation of\nacceleration and the speed oscillation are strong. Simulations show that with\nthe memory effect of drivers taken into account, the improved two-dimensional\nintelligent driver model is able to reproduce the common feature of traffic\noscillation evolution quite well.\n", "  We address the problem of classifying the links of signed social networks\ngiven their full structural topology. Motivated by a binary user behaviour\nassumption, which is supported by decades of research in psychology, we develop\nan efficient and surprisingly simple approach to solve this classification\nproblem. Our methods operate both within the active and batch settings. We\ndemonstrate that the algorithms we developed are extremely fast in both\ntheoretical and practical terms. Within the active setting, we provide a new\ncomplexity measure and a rigorous analysis of our methods that hold for\narbitrary signed networks. We validate our theoretical claims carrying out a\nset of experiments on three well known real-world datasets, showing that our\nmethods outperform the competitors while being much faster.\n", "  Nowadays, travel surveys provide rich information about urban mobility and\ncommuting patterns. But, at the same time, they have drawbacks: they are static\npictures of a dynamic phenomena, are expensive to make, and take prolonged\nperiods of time to finish. However, the availability of mobile usage data (Call\nDetail Records) makes the study of urban mobility possible at levels not known\nbefore. This has been done in the past with good results--mobile data makes\npossible to find and understand aggregated mobility patterns. In this paper, we\npropose to analyze mobile data at individual level by estimating daily\njourneys, and use those journeys to build Origin-Destiny matrices to understand\nurban flow. We evaluate this approach with large anonymized CDRs from Santiago,\nChile, and find that our method has a high correlation ($\\rho = 0.89$) with the\ncurrent travel survey, and that it captures external anomalies in daily travel\npatterns, making our method suitable for inclusion into urban computing\napplications.\n", "  Measurements of electroweak production in the forward region at the LHC\nprovide unique and complementary information to those performed in the central\nregion. Studies have been performed not just by LHCb, a dedicated forward\ndetector, but also by ATLAS and CMS, which are primarily situated in the\ncentral region but can exploit forward calorimetry coverage to contribute to\nthe understanding of SM processes in the forward region.\n", "  For an arbitrary Nakajima quiver variety $X$, we construct an analog of the\nquantum dynamical Weyl group acting in its equivariant K-theory. The correct\ngeneralization of the Weyl group here is the fundamental groupoid of a certain\nperiodic locally finite hyperplane arrangement in $Pic(X)\\otimes {\\mathbb{C}}$.\nWe identify the lattice part of this groupoid with the operators of quantum\ndifference equation for $X$. The cases of quivers of finite and affine type are\nillustrated by explicit examples.\n", "  Forward top production is observed, in the ${\\mu}+b$ final state, with the 3\nfb$^{-1}$ Run I dataset collected by the LHCb detector. The combined\ncross-section for $t\\bar{t}$ and single top production at $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV and\n$\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV is measured, for muons from the W boson with $p_{\\rm T} > 25$\nGeV in the pseudo-rapidity range 2.0$< \\eta <$4.5 and with a b-tagged jet with\n50$ < p_{\\rm T} < 100$ GeV in the pseudorapidity range 2.2$< \\eta <$4.2. The\nproduction cross-sections are found to be in agreement with NLO predictions.\n", "  Production of Higgs bosons at the LHC is affected by the contribution of\nlight quarks, that mediate the gg \\to Hg transition. Although their impact is\nsuppressed by small Yukawa couplings, it is enhanced by large logarithms of the\nratio of the Higgs boson mass or its transverse momentum to light quark masses.\nWe study the origin of this enhancement, focusing on the abelian corrections to\ngg \\to Hg amplitudes of the form (C_F alphas L^{2})^n, where $L \\in {\nln(s/mb^2), ln(p_\\perp^2/mb^2) }. We show how these non-Sudakov double\nlogarithmic terms can be resummed to all orders in the strong coupling\nconstant. Interestingly, we find that the transverse momentum dependence of\nthese corrections is very weak due to a peculiar cancellation between different\nlogarithmic terms. Although the abelian part of QCD corrections is not expected\nto be dominant, it can be used to estimate missing higher-order corrections to\nlight quark contributions to Higgs boson production at the LHC.\n", "  These are the lectures notes of the course given at the Eleventh Modave\nSummer School in Mathematical Physics, 2015, aimed at PhD candidates and junior\nresearchers in theoretical physics. We review in details the result of\nCoussaert-Henneaux-van Driel showing that the asymptotic dynamics of $(2+1)$-\ndimensional gravity with negative cosmological constant is described at the\nclassical level by Liouville theory. Boundary conditions implement the\nasymptotic reduction in two steps: the first set reduces the $SL(2,\\mathbb\nR)\\times SL(2,\\mathbb R)$ Chern-Simons action, equivalent to the Einstein\naction, to a non-chiral $SL(2,\\mathbb R)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model, while the\nsecond set imposes constraints on the WZW currents that reduce further the\naction to Liouville theory. We discuss the issues of considering the latter as\nan effective description of the dual conformal field theory describing AdS$_3$\ngravity beyond the semi-classical regime.\n", "  Elementary Cycles are intrinsic periodic phenomena, classical in the essence,\nwhose classical relativistic dynamics reproduce the complete coherence (perfect\nrecurrences) typically associated to the pure quantum behaviours of elementary\nparticles. They can be regarded as effective representations of 't Hooft\nCellular Automata. By means of Elementary Cycles physics we obtain a\nconsistent, intuitive, novel derivation of the peculiar quantum dynamics of\nelectrons in Carbon Nanotubes, as well as of Superconductivity fundamental\nphenomenology. In particular we derive, from classical arguments, the essential\nelectronic properties of graphene systems, such as energy bands and density of\nstates. Similarly, in the second part of the paper, we derive the\nSuperconductivity fundamental phenomenology in terms of simple geometrical\nconsiderations, directly from the Elementary Cycles dynamics rather than from\nempirical aspects and effective quantities connected to the microscopical\ncharacteristics of materials as in the standard approaches to\nSuperconductivity. With this approach simple geometrical considerations about\nthe competition between the quantum recurrence and the thermal noise allow for\na novel interpretation of the occurrence of high temperature superconductivity\nand the related gauge symmetry breaking mechanism.\n", "  Zeta potential is a physicochemical parameter of particular importance in\ndescribing the surface electrical properties of charged porous media. However,\nthe zeta potential of calcite is still poorly known because of the difficulty\nto interpret streaming potential experiments. The Helmholtz-Smoluchowski (HS)\nequation is widely used to estimate the apparent zeta potential from these\nexperiments. However, this equation neglects the influence of surface\nconductivity on streaming potential. We present streaming potential and\nelectrical conductivity measurements on a calcite powder in contact with an\naqueous NaCl electrolyte. Our streaming potential model corrects the apparent\nzeta potential of calcite by accounting for the influence of surface\nconductivity and flow regime. We show that the HS equation seriously\nunderestimates the zeta potential of calcite, particularly when the electrolyte\nis diluted (ionic strength < 0.01 M) because of calcite surface conductivity.\nThe basic Stern model successfully predicted the corrected zeta potential by\nassuming that the zeta potential is located at the outer Helmholtz plane, i.e.\nwithout considering a stagnant diffuse layer at the calcite-water interface.\nThe surface conductivity of calcite crystals was inferred from electrical\nconductivity measurements and computed using our basic Stern model. Surface\nconductivity was also successfully predicted by our surface complexation model.\n", "  The reactions of carbon atoms with dihydrogen have been investigated in\nliquid helium droplets at $T$ = 0.37 K. A calorimetric technique was applied to\nmonitor the energy released in the reaction. The barrierless reaction between a\nsingle carbon atom and a single dihydrogen molecule was detected. Reactions\nbetween dihydrogen clusters and carbon atoms have been studied by\nhigh-resolution mass spectrometry. The formation of hydrocarbon cations of the\ntype C$_m$H$_n^+$, with $m$ = 1-4 and $n$ = 1-15 was observed. With enhanced\nconcentration of dihydrogen, the mass spectra demonstrated the main \"magic\"\npeak assigned to the CH$_5^+$ cation. A simple formation pathway and the high\nstability of this cation suggest its high abundance in the interstellar medium.\n", "  In synchrotron radiation there is a paradox whether or not the pitch angle of\na radiating charge varies. The conventional wisdom is that the pitch angle does\nnot change during the radiation process. The argument is based on Larmor's\nradiation formula, where in a synchrotron case the radiation power is along the\ninstantaneous direction of motion of the charge. Then the momentum loss will\nalso be parallel to that direction and therefore the pitch angle of the charge\nwould remain unaffected. The accordingly derived formulas for energy losses of\nsynchrotron electrons in radio galaxies are the standard text-book material for\nthe last 50 years. However, if we use the momentum transformation laws from\nspecial relativity, then we find that the pitch angle of a radiating charge\nvaries. While the velocity component parallel to the magnetic field remains\nunaffected, the perpendicular component does reduce in magnitude due to\nradiative losses, implying a change in the pitch angle. This apparent paradox\nis resolved when effects on the charge motion are calculated not from Larmor's\nformula but from Lorentz's radiation reaction formula. We derive the exact\nformulation by taking into account the change of the pitch angle due to\nradiative losses. From this we first time derive the characteristic decay time\nof synchrotron electrons over which they turn from highly relativistic into\nmildly relativistic ones.\n", "  The use of polarized beams enhance the possibility of the precision\nmeasurements at the International Linear Collider (ILC). In order to preserve\nthe degree of polarization during beam transport spin rotators are included in\nthe current TDR ILC Lattice. In this report some advantages of using a combined\nspin rotator/spin flipper are discussed. A few possible lattice designs of spin\nflipper developed at DESY in 2012 are presented.\n", "  On the basis of a mathematical model, we continue the study of the metabolic\nKrebs cycle (or the tricarboxilic acid cycle). For the first time, we consider\nits consistency and stability, which depend on the dissipation of a\ntransmembrane potential formed by the respiratory chain in the plasmatic\nmembrane of a cell. The phase-parametric characteristic of the dynamics of the\nATP level depending on a given parameter is constructed. The scenario of\nformation of multiple autoperiodic and chaotic modes is presented. Poincar\\'{e}\nsections and mappings are constructed. The stability of modes and the\nfractality of the obtained bifurcations are studied. The full spectra of\nLyapunov indices, divergences, KS-entropies, horizons of predictability, and\nLyapunov dimensionalities of strange attractors are calculated. Some\nconclusions about the structural-functional connections determining the\ndependence of the cell respiration cyclicity on the synchronization of the\nfunctioning of the tricarboxilic acid cycle and the electron transport chain\nare presented.\n", "  We try to find the relation between the three-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model\nand QCD based on the hypothesis that the gluon momenta are sharply condensed\naround the QCD scale, \\mu_g. We find that the effective four- and six-fermion\ninteractions, G_4 and G_6, should be scaled by G_4 proportional to \\mu_g^(-2)\nand G_6 proportional to \\mu_g^(-5) being consistent with the mass dimension\ncounting in the obtained effective Lagrangian. We then study the \\mu_g\ndependence on the phase diagram of the chiral phase transition at finite\ntemperature and chemical potential and the location of the critical point. We\nfind that the location of the critical point are sensitively affected by the\nvalue of the introduced gluon energy scale.\n", "  A general methodology is proposed to engineer a system of interacting\ncomponents (particles) which is able to self-regulate their concentrations in\norder to produce any prescribed output in response to a particular input. The\nmethodology is based on the mathematical equivalence between artificial neurons\nin neural networks and species in autocatalytic reactions, and it specifies the\nrelationship between the artificial neural network's parameters and the rate\ncoefficients of the reactions between particle species. Such systems are\ncharacterised by a high degree of robustness as they are able to reach the\ndesired output despite disturbances and perturbations of the concentrations of\nthe various species.\n", "  The Neumann boundary problem for the perturbed sine-Gordon equation\ndescribing the electrodynamics of Josephson junctions has been considered. The\nbehavior of a viscous term, described by a higher-order derivative with small\ndiffusion coefficient, is investigated. The Green function related to the\nlinear third order operator is determined by means of Fourier series, and\nproperties of rapid convergence are established. Furthermore, some classes of\nsolutions of the hyperbolic equation have been determined, proving that there\nexists at least one solution whose derivatives are bounded. Results prove that\ndiffusion effects are bounded and tend to zero when the small diffusion\ncoefficient tends to zero.\n", "  In this dissertation we analyzed the double-layer force interaction between\ntwo dielectric charged colloidal spheres of different radii immersed in a\nsolution of ions in water and in thermal equilibrium. In the limit of low\nelectrostatic potential the interaction is governed by the Linearized\nPoisson-Boltzmann Equation (LPBE). We obtained an analytical solution from the\nLPBE for the electrostatic interaction via multipole expansion, considering a\nuniform and fixed surface charge density on the spheres. A code in the\nMathematica platform was developed, allowing us to calculate the force between\nthe spheres as a function of their separation. In order to validate the code,\nwe compared our numerical results with the analytical ones in the limits of\nLinear Superposition Approximation (LSA) (valid for sphere separations much\ngreater than the Debye length) and Proximity Force Approximation (PFA) (valid\nfor sphere separations and Debye length much smaller than the radii of the\nspheres).\n", "  In astrophysics, the two main methods traditionally in use for solving the\nEuler equations of ideal fluid dynamics are smoothed particle hydrodynamics and\nfinite volume discretization on a stationary mesh. However, the goal to\nefficiently make use of future exascale machines with their ever higher degree\nof parallel concurrency motivates the search for more efficient and more\naccurate techniques for computing hydrodynamics. Discontinuous Galerkin (DG)\nmethods represent a promising class of methods in this regard, as they can be\nstraightforwardly extended to arbitrarily high order while requiring only small\nstencils. Especially for applications involving comparatively smooth problems,\nhigher-order approaches promise significant gains in computational speed for\nreaching a desired target accuracy. Here, we introduce our new astrophysical DG\ncode TENET designed for applications in cosmology, and discuss our first\nresults for 3D simulations of subsonic turbulence. We show that our new DG\nimplementation provides accurate results for subsonic turbulence, at\nconsiderably reduced computational cost compared with traditional finite volume\nmethods. In particular, we find that DG needs about 1.8 times fewer degrees of\nfreedom to achieve the same accuracy and at the same time is more than 1.5\ntimes faster, confirming its substantial promise for astrophysical\napplications.\n", "  Within the framework of fuel cells, porous materials are used for filtration\npurpose. Determining physical properties like porosity and permeability are of\nutmost importance to predict and to manage filtration efficiency of the\nmaterials. The permeability of materials is often determined experimentally in\nlaboratory with disc samples (outlet of the flow is achieved through the porous\nmaterial) that are not exactly similar to the tubes which are used in realistic\noperating conditions (a main flow is found additionally to the one through the\nmaterial). Thus, the effect of a second outlet on the Darcian's permeability\ncharacterization bench should be studied. In the present paper, we present a\nnew test bench to determine experimentally the Darcy's and Forchheimer's\npermeabilities for a porous media by taking into account two outlets. Operating\nparameters (temperature, pressure and mass flow rate) are measured for three\ndifferent configurations: i) secondary outlet (S.O) is 0% open, ii) S.O is 50%\nopen and iii) S.O is 100% open. Then Darcy's and Forchheimer's permeability for\nall these three cases are compared and discussed in details. It has been found\nthat the secondary outlet opening does not affect the Darcian's permeability\nbut have substantial influence on the Forchheimer's one through the\nmodifications of the range of study (lower mass flow rate penetrates the porous\nmedium).\n", "  In the very early universe, a generalized Schwinger effect can create pairs\nfrom both electrical and gravitational fields. The expectation value of\nfermionic current induced by these newly created pairs has been recently\ncomputed in de Sitter spacetime. I will discuss different limiting cases of\nthis result and some of its possible physical interpretations.\n", "  We report a calculation of time-dependent quasi-geostrophic core flows for\n1940-2010. Inverting recursively for an ensemble of solutions, we evaluate the\nmain source of uncertainties, namely the model errors arising from interactions\nbetween unresolved core surface motions and magnetic fields. Temporal\ncorrelations of these uncertainties are accounted for. The covariance matrix\nfor the flow coefficients is also obtained recursively from the dispersion of\nan ensemble of solutions. Maps of the flow at the core surface show, upon a\nplanetary-scale gyre, time-dependent large-scale eddies at mid-latitudes and\nvigorous azimuthal jets in the equatorial belt. The stationary part of the flow\npredominates on all the spatial scales that we can resolve. We retrieve\ntorsional waves that explain the length-of-day changes at 4 to 9.5 years\nperiods. These waves may be triggered by the nonlinear interaction between the\nmagnetic field and sub-decadal non-zonal motions within the fluid outer core.\nBoth the zonal and the more energetic non-zonal interannual motions were\nparticularly intense close to the equator (below 10 degrees latitude) between\n1995 and 2010. We revise down the amplitude of the decade fluctuations of the\nplanetary scale circulation and find that electromagnetic core-mantle coupling\nis not the main mechanism for angular momentum exchanges on decadal time scales\nif mantle conductance is 3 10 8 S or lower.\n", "  In this article we revisit the significance of the often debated structural\nsimilarity between the equations of electromagnetism and fluid dynamics.\nAlthough the matching of the two sets of equations has successfully been done\nfor non-dissipative forms of the equations, little has been done for cases\nwhere the dissipative terms are non-negligible. We consider the consequence of\nnon-negligible viscosity and diffusivity, and how the fine-tuning of these\nparameters could allow fluid dynamics to be used to indirectly study certain\nproperties of magnetic fields.\n", "  It is well-known that thermal equilibrium states in quantum statistical\nmechanics and quantum field theory can be described in a mathematically\nrigorous manner by means of the so-called Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS)\ncondition, which is based on certain analyticity and periodicity properties of\ncorrelation functions. On the other hand, the characterization of\nnon-equilibrium states which only locally have thermal properties still\nconstitutes a challenge in quantum field theory. We discuss a recent proposal\nfor characterization of such states by a generalized KMS condition. The\nconnection of this proposal to a proposal by D. Buchholz, I. Ojima and H.-J.\nRoos for characterizing local thermal equilibrium states in quantum field\ntheory is discussed.\n", "  We studied iron-based superconductors of various families with critical\ntemperatures covering almost all range $T_C = 9 - 53$ K. In natural arrays of\ncontacts formed in these materials we observed intrinsic multiple Andreev\nreflections effect (IMARE). By using IMARE spectroscopy, we detected the\ntwo-gap superconductivity, determined the value of the large and the small\nsuperconducting gaps, and the corresponding BCS-ratios. The temperature\ndependencies of the large and the small gaps $\\Delta_{L,S}(T)$ are similar for\nvarious families of the Fe-based superconductors and could be well-fitted in\nthe framework of the two-band model by Moskalenko and Suhl. We concluded on the\nextended s-wave symmetry of the $\\Delta_L$ order parameter (20-30 % anisotropy\nin k-space) and on the absence of nodes for $\\Delta_S$. The BCS-ratio\n$2\\Delta_L/k_BT_C \\approx 5.2$ is nearly constant within the whole range of\n$T_C$ (this means that coupling rate is unchanged), reflecting the 20 %\nreduction of the $T_C^{local}$ in relation to the eigen $T_C^L$, and the large\ngap roughly corresponds to the energy of magnetic resonance $2\\Delta_L \\approx\nE_{res}$. This result requires a special theoretical consideration. Our\nestimation of the relative coupling constants and eigen parameters of each\ncondensate (in a hypothetical case of a zero interband interaction)\n$2\\Delta_L/k_BT_C^L = 4.2 - 4.8$ and $2\\Delta_S/k_BT_C^S = 3.5 - 4.5$ leads to\nindirect conclusion that namely a strong electron-phonon interaction in each\ncondensate described in the framework of the Eliashberg theory plays the key\nrole in the superconductivity of iron-based oxypnictides. With it, the two\ncondensates interact weakly with each other. The observed scaling of\n$\\Delta_{L,S}$ with $T_C$, as was discussed above, is caused mainly by changing\nof the density of states $N_{L,S}$ in the bands, whereas Ln-O spacers act as\ncharge reservoirs.\n", "  We discuss our current understanding of the nature of the faint,\nhigh-frequency radio sky. The Tenth Cambridge (10C) survey at 15.7 GHz is the\ndeepest high-frequency radio survey to date, covering 12 square degrees to a\ncompleteness limit of 0.5 mJy, making it the ideal starting point from which to\nstudy this population. In this work we have matched the 10C survey to several\nlower-frequency radio catalogues and a wide range of multi-wavelength data\n(near- and far-infrared, optical and X-ray). We find a significant increase in\nthe proportion of flat-spectrum sources at flux densities below 1 mJy - the\nmedian radio spectral index between 15.7 GHz and 610 MHz changes from 0.75 for\nflux densities greater than 1.5 mJy to 0.08 for flux densities less than 0.8\nmJy. The multi-wavelength analysis shows that the vast majority (> 94 percent)\nof the 10C sources are radio galaxies; it is therefore likely that these faint,\nflat spectrum sources are a result of the cores of radio galaxies becoming\ndominant at high frequencies. We have used new observations to extend this\nstudy to even fainter flux densities, calculating the 15.7-GHz radio source\ncount down to 0.1 mJy, a factor of five deeper than previous studies. There is\nno evidence for a new population of sources, showing that the high-frequency\nsky continues to be dominated by radio galaxies down to at least 0.1 mJy.\n", "  Over the past few decades, the rate of publication retractions has increased\ndramatically in academia. In this study, we investigate retractions from a\nquantitative perspective, aiming to answer two fundamental questions. One, how\ndo retractions influence the scholarly impact of retracted papers, authors, and\ninstitutions? Two, does this influence propagate to the wider academic\ncommunity through scholarly associations? Specifically, we analyzed a set of\nretracted articles indexed in Thomson Reuters Web of Science (WoS), and ran\nmultiple experiments to compare changes in scholarly impact against a control\nset of non-retracted articles, authors, and institutions. We further applied\nthe Granger Causality test to investigate whether different scientific topics\nare dynamically affected by retracted papers occurring within those topics. Our\nresults show two key findings: first, the scholarly impact of retracted papers\nand authors significantly decreases after retraction, and the most severe\nimpact decrease correlates to retractions based on proven purposeful scientific\nmisconduct; second, this retraction penalty does not seem to spread through the\nbroader scholarly social graph, but instead has a limited and localized effect.\nOur findings may provide useful insights for scholars or science committees to\nevaluate the scholarly value of papers, authors, or institutions related to\nretractions.\n", "  An information reconciliation method for continuous-variable quantum key\ndistribution with Gaussian modulation that is based on non-binary low-density\nparity-check (LDPC) codes is presented. Sets of regular and irregular LDPC\ncodes with different code rates over the Galois fields $GF(8)$, $GF(16)$,\n$GF(32)$, and $GF(64)$ have been constructed. We have performed simulations to\nanalyze the efficiency and the frame error rate using the sum-product\nalgorithm. The proposed method achieves an efficiency between $0.94$ and $0.98$\nif the signal-to-noise ratio is between $4$ dB and $24$ dB.\n", "  Aberg has claimed in a recent Letter,\" Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 150402 (2014)\",\nthat the coherence of a reservoir can be used repeatedly to perform coherent\noperations without ever diminishing in power to do so. The claim has particular\nrelevance for quantum thermodynamics because, as shown in \"Phys. Rev. Lett.\n113, 150402 (2014)\", latent energy that is locked by coherence may be\nextractable without incurring any additional cost. We show here, however, that\nrepeated use of the reservoir gives an overall coherent operation of diminished\naccuracy and is necessarily accompanied by an increased thermodynamic cost.\n", "  There are several background sources which may affect the analysis of data\nand detector performans at the CLIC project. One of the important background\nsource is halo muons, which are generated along the beam delivery system (BDS),\nfor the detector performance. In order to reduce muon background, magnetized\nmuon sweepers have been used as a shielding material that is already described\nin a previous study for CLIC [1]. The realistic muon sweeper has been designed\nwith OPERA. The design parameters of muon sweeper have also been used to\nestimate muon background reduction with BDSIM Monte Carlo simulation code [2,\n3].\n", "  We demonstrate a compact fibre-based laser system at 2.05 microns stabilized\nto a CO2 transition using frequency modulation spectroscopy of a gas-filled\nhollow-core fibre. The laser exhibits an absolute frequency accuracy of 5 MHz,\na frequency stability noise floor of better than 7 kHz or 5e-11 and is tunable\nwithin +/-200 MHz from the molecular resonance frequency while retaining\nroughly this stability and accuracy.\n", "  This paper presents the overview of improving photon reconstruction in\nPandoraPFA. We have reduced the fragmentation and improved the photon\nseparation resolution. As a result, the reconstructed photons have a greater\ncompleteness and purity, and the jet energy resolution has improved for high\nenergy jets.\n", "  We present herein gain stabilization studies of SiPMs using a climate chamber\nat CERN. We present results for four detectors not tested before, three from\nHamamatsu and one from KETEK. Two of the Hamamatsu SiPMs are novel sensors with\ntrenches that reduce cross talk. We use an improved readout system with a\ndigital oscilloscope controlled with a dedicated LabView program. We improved\nand automized the analysis to deal with large datasets. We have measured the\ngain-versus-bias-voltage dependence at fixed temperature and\ngain-versus-temperature dependence at fixed bias voltage to determine the bias\nvoltage dependence on temperature $V(T)$ for stable gain. We show that the gain\nremains stable to better than $\\pm 0.5\\%$ in the $20^\\circ \\rm C - 30^\\circ C$\ntemperature range if the bias voltage is properly adjusted with temperature.\n", "  In radial fast spin-echo MRI, a set of overlapping spokes with an\ninconsistent T2 weighting is acquired, which results in an averaged image\ncontrast when employing conventional image reconstruction techniques. This work\ndemonstrates that the problem may be overcome with the use of a dedicated\nreconstruction method that further allows for T2 quantification by extracting\nthe embedded relaxation information. Thus, the proposed reconstruction method\ndirectly yields a spin-density and relaxivity map from only a single radial\ndata set. The method is based on an inverse formulation of the problem and\ninvolves a modeling of the received MRI signal. Because the solution is found\nby numerical optimization, the approach exploits all data acquired. Further, it\nhandles multi-coil data and optionally allows for the incorporation of\nadditional prior knowledge. Simulations and experimental results for a phantom\nand human brain in vivo demonstrate that the method yields spin-density and\nrelaxivity maps that are neither affected by the typical artifacts from TE\nmixing, nor by streaking artifacts from the incomplete k-space coverage at\nindividual echo times.\n", "  The article is devoted to the simulation of viscous incompressible turbulent\nfluid flow based on solving the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)\nequations with different k-omega models. The isogeometrical approach is used\nfor the discretization based on the Galerkin method. Primary goal of using\nisogeometric analysis is to be always geometrically exact, independent of the\ndiscretization, and to avoid a time-consuming generation of meshes of\ncomputational domains. For higher Reynolds numbers, we use stabilization SUPG\ntechnique in equations for k and omega. The solutions are compared with the\nstandard benchmark example of turbulent flow over a backward facing step.\n", "  The propagation of light through bianisotropic materials is studied in the\ngeometrical optics approximation. For that purpose, we use the quartic general\ndispersion equation specified by the Tamm-Rubilar tensor, which is cubic in the\nelectromagnetic response tensor of the medium. A collection of different and\nremarkable Fresnel (wave) surfaces is gathered, and unified via the projective\ngeometry of Kummer surfaces.\n", "  We calculate low-frequency gyrotropic spin excitation modes of the skyrmion\nground state ultrathin cylindrical magnetic dots. The skyrmion is assumed to be\nstabilized at room temperature and zero external magnetic field due to an\ninterplay of the isotropic and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interactions,\nperpendicular magnetic anisotropy and magnetostatic interaction. We consider\nBloch- and Neel-type magnetic skyrmions and assume that the dot magnetization\ndoes not depend on the thickness coordinate. The skyrmion gyrotropic\nfrequencies are calculated in GHz range as a function of the skyrmion\nequilibrium radius, dot radius and the dot magnetic parameters. Recent\nexperiments on magnetic skyrmion gyrotropic dynamics in nanodots are discussed.\n", "  We derive a Bouchard--Eynard type topological recursion for the total\ndescendant potential of $A_N$-singularity. Our argument relies on a certain\ntwisted representation of a Heisenberg Vertex Operator Algebra (VOA)\nconstructed via the periods of $A_N$-singularity. In particular, our approach\nallows us to prove that the topological recursion for the total descendant\npotential is equivalent to a certain generating set of $\\mathcal{W}$-algebra\nconstraints.\n", "  We take up the study of integrable structures behind non-planar contributions\nto scattering amplitudes in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory. Focusing on leading\nsingularities, we derive the action of the Yangian generators on color-ordered\nsubsets of the external states. Each subset corresponds to a single boundary of\nthe non-planar on-shell diagram. While Yangian invariance is broken, we find\nthat higher-level Yangian generators still annihilate the non-planar on-shell\ndiagram. For a given diagram, the number of these generators is governed by the\ndegree of non-planarity. Furthermore, we present additional identities\ninvolving integrable transfer matrices. In particular, for diagrams on a\ncylinder we obtain a conservation rule similar to the Yangian invariance\ncondition of planar on-shell diagrams. To exemplify our results, we consider a\nfive-point MHV on-shell function on a cylinder.\n", "  We have investigated the dynamical properties of coherent phonons generated\nin antimony under high density photo excitation. Precise measurements and\nextended analysis of coherent phonon oscillations provide new insights into the\nprocess of impulsive softening. In the process of recovering from instantaneous\nsoftening, phonon frequency shows an unexpected temporal evolution involving an\nabrupt change and a slight overshoot. Moreover, fluence dependence of the\ninitial phonon frequency is strongly correlated with the phonon frequency shift\nof the high-pressure Raman spectra. These results clearly prove that the\nstructural changes (lattice contraction and expansion) induced by laser\nexcitation governs the softening mechanism of coherent phonons.\n", "  Our consistent effort to unravel the mystery of super-Chandrasekhar white\ndwarfs (WDs), by exploiting the potential of magnetic fields, has brought this\ntopic considerable attention. This is also evident from the recent surge in the\ncorresponding literature. In the present work, by means of full-scale general\nrelativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) numerical analysis, we confirm the\nexistence of stable, highly magnetized, significantly super-Chandrasekhar WDs\nhaving mass exceeding 3 solar mass. We have explored various possible field\nconfigurations, namely, poloidal, toroidal and mixed, by self-consistently\nincorporating the departure from spherical symmetry induced by a strong\nmagnetic field. Such super-Chandrasekhar WDs can be ideal progenitors of\npeculiar, over-luminous type Ia supernovae.\n", "  Observations of several peculiar, under- and over-luminous type Ia supernovae\n(SNeIa) argue for exploding masses widely different from the\nChandrasekhar-limit. We explore the modification to Einstein's gravity in white\ndwarfs for the first time in the literature, which shows that depending on the\n(density dependent) modified gravity parameter $\\alpha$, chosen for the present\npurpose of representation, limiting mass of white dwarfs could be significantly\nsub- as well as super-Chandrasekhar. Hence, this unifies the apparently\ndisjoint classes of SNeIa, establishing the importance of modified Einstein's\ngravity in white dwarfs. Our discovery questions both the global validity of\nEinstein's gravity and the uniqueness of Chandrasekhar's limit.\n", "  We show that the removal of angular momentum is possible in the presence of\nlarge scale magnetic stresses, arisen by fields much stronger than that\nrequired for magnetorotational instability, in geometrically thick, advective,\nsub-Keplerian accretion flows around black holes in steady-state, in the\ncomplete absence of alpha-viscosity. The efficiency of such angular momentum\ntransfer via Maxwell stress, with the field well below its equipartition value,\ncould be equivalent to that of alpha-viscosity, arisen via Reynolds stress,\nwith $\\alpha=0.01-0.08$. We find in our simpler vertically averaged advective\ndisk model that stronger the magnetic field and/or larger the vertical-gradient\nof azimuthal component of magnetic field, stronger the rate of angular momentum\ntransfer is, which in turn may lead to a faster rate of outflowing matter,\nwhich has important implications to describe the hard spectral states of black\nhole sources. When the generic origin of alpha-viscosity is still being\nexplored, mechanism of efficient angular momentum transfer via magnetic\nstresses alone is very interesting.\n", "  We search for low-dimensional chaotic signatures in the optical lightcurve of\nthe $Kepler$ field blazar W2R 1926+42. The frequently used correlation integral\nmethod is employed in our analysis. We find no apparent evidence for the\npresence of low-dimensional chaos in the lightcurve. If further confirmed,\nthese results could be of importance for modeling the blazar emission\nmechanisms.\n", "  We show that the soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars\n(AXPs) can be explained as recently proposed highly magnetized white dwarfs\n(B-WDs). The radius and magnetic field of B-WDs are perfectly adequate to\nexplain energies in SGRs/AXPs as the rotationally powered energy. While the\nhighly magnetized neutron stars require an extra, observationally not well\nestablished yet, source of energy, the magnetized white dwarfs, yet following\nChandrasekhar's theory (C-WDs), exhibit large ultra-violet luminosity which is\nobservationally constrained from a strict upper limit.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of hydromagnetic perturbations in a small\nsection of accretion disks. It is known that molecular viscosity is negligible\nin accretion disks. Hence, it has been argued that Magnetorotational\nInstability (MRI) is responsible for transporting matter in the presence of\nweak magnetic field. However, there are some shortcomings, which question\neffectiveness of MRI. Now the question arises, whether other hydromagnetic\neffects, e.g. transient growth (TG), can play an important role to bring\nnonlinearity in the system, even at weak magnetic fields. Otherwise, whether\nMRI or TG, which is primarily responsible to reveal nonlinearity to make the\nflow turbulent? Our results prove explicitly that the flows with high Reynolds\nnumber (Re), which is the case of realistic astrophysical accretion disks,\nexhibit nonlinearity by best TG of perturbation modes faster than that by best\nmodes producing MRI. For a fixed wavevector, MRI dominates over transient\neffects, only at low Re, lower than its value expected to be in astrophysical\naccretion disks, and low magnetic fields. This seriously questions (overall)\npersuasiveness of MRI in astrophysical accretion disks.\n", "  Electronic quantum entanglement between the central chain and the two\nelectrodes in an infinite one-dimensional two-probe device system is studied.\nThe entanglement entropy is calculated employing the nonequilibrium Green's\nfunction method in the tight-binding model based on the relation between the\ncorrelation matrix and the von Neumann entropy. By extending the entropy to\nnonequilibrium cases, we have studied the scaling behavior when a voltage bias\nis applied between the two electrodes. The entropy usually decreases with the\nbias and may jump up when a quasi-state in the chain aligns in energy with the\nband edges in the electrodes. Odd-even effect is observed due to the symmetry\nof the chain.\n", "  We study the ground state properties of spin-half bosons subjected to the\nRashba spin-orbit coupling in two dimensions. Due to the enhancement of the low\nenergy density of states, it is expected that the effect of interaction becomes\nmore important. After reviewing several possible ideal condensed states, we\ncarry out an exact diagonalization calculation for a cluster of the bosons in\nthe presence of strong spin-orbit coupling on a two-dimensional disk and reveal\nstrong correlations in its ground state. We derive a low-energy effective\nHamiltonian to understand how states with strong correlations become\nenergetically more favorable than the ideal condensed states.\n", "  Chimera states are complex spatio-temporal patterns that consist of\ncoexisting domains of coherent and incoherent dynamics. We analyse chimera\nstates in networks of Van der Pol oscillators with hierarchical coupling\ntopology. We investigate the stepwise transition from a nonlocal to a\nhierarchical topology, and propose the network clustering coefficient as a\nmeasure to establish a link between the existence of chimera states and the\ncompactness of the initial base pattern of a hierarchical topology; we show\nthat a large clustering coefficient promotes the occurrence of chimeras.\nDepending on the level of hierarchy and base pattern, we obtain chimera states\nwith different numbers of incoherent domains. We investigate the chimera\nregimes as a function of coupling strength and nonlinearity parameter of the\nindividual oscillators. The analysis of a network with larger base pattern\nresulting in larger clustering coefficient reveals two different types of\nchimera states and highlights the increasing role of amplitude dynamics.\n", "  We here derive the so-called Nonlinear Analytical Envelope Equation (NAEE)\ninspired by the work of Conforti et al. [M. Conforti, A. Marini, T. X. Tran, D.\nFaccio, and F. Biancalana, \"Interaction between optical fields and their\nconjugates in nonlinear media,\" Opt. Express 21, 31239-31252 (2013)], whose\nnotation we follow. We present a complete model that includes $\\chi^{(2)}$\nterms [M. Conforti, F. Baronio, and C. De Angelis, \"Nonlinear envelope equation\nfor broadband optical pulses in quadratic media,\" Phys. Rev. A 81, 053841\n(2010)], $\\chi^{(3)}$ terms, and then extend the model to delayed Raman effects\nin the $\\chi^{(3)}$ term. We therefore get a complete model for ultrafast pulse\npropagation in quadratic nonlinear crystals similar to the Nonlinear Wave\nEquation in Frequency domain [H. Guo, X. Zeng, B. Zhou, and M. Bache,\n\"Nonlinear wave equation in frequency domain: accurate modeling of ultrafast\ninteraction in anisotropic nonlinear media,\" J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 30, 494-504\n(2013)], but where the envelope is modelled rather than the electrical field\nwhile still keeping a sub-carrier level resolution. The advantage of the\nenvelope formation is that the physical origin of the additional terms that are\nincluded to model the physics at the carrier level becomes more clear, in\ncontrast to the electric field equations that are more \"black box\" expansions\nof the electrical field. We also point out that by comparing our results to a\nvery similar model and widely used model [G. Genty, P. Kinsler, B. Kibler, and\nJ. M. Dudley, \"Nonlinear envelope equation modeling of sub-cycle dynamics and\nharmonic generation in nonlinear waveguides,\" Opt. Express 15, 5382-5387\n(2007)], the Raman terms presented there will most likely lead to an\nartificially lower Raman effect.\n", "  Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) was used to investigate the static and dynamic\nmagnetic properties of carbon-doped Mn5Ge3 (C$_{0.1}$ and C$_{0.2}$) thin films\ngrown on Ge(111). The temperature dependence of magnetic anisotropy shows an\nincreased perpendicular magneto-crystalline contribution at 80K with an\nin-plane easy axis due to the large shape contribution. We find that our\nsamples show a small FMR linewidth (corresponding to an intrinsic magnetic\ndamping parameter $\\alpha$=0.005), which is a measure of the spin relaxation\nand directly related with the magnetic and structural quality of the material.\nIn the perpendicular-to-plane geometry, the FMR linewidth shows a minimum at\naround 200K for all the samples, which seems to be not correlated to the\nC-doping. The magnetic relaxation parameters have been determined and indicate\nthe two-magnon scattering as the main extrinsic contribution. We observe a\nchange in the main contribution from scattering centres in Mn5Ge3C0.2 at low\ntemperatures, which could be related to the minimum in linewidth.\n", "  This is a series of four lectures presented at the 2015 Enrico Fermi summer\nschool in Varenna. The aim of the lectures is to give an introduction to the\nhydrodynamics of active matter concentrating on low Reynolds number examples\nsuch as cells and molecular motors. Lecture 1 introduces the hydrodynamics of\nsingle active particles, covering the Stokes equation and the Scallop Theorem,\nand stressing the link between autonomous activity and the dipolar symmetry of\nthe far flow field. In lecture 2 I discuss applications of this mathematics to\nthe behaviour of microswimmers at surfaces and in external flows, and describe\nour current understanding of how swimmers stir the surrounding fluid. Lecture 3\nconcentrates on the collective behaviour of active particles, modelled as an\nactive nematic. I write down the equations of motion and motivate the form of\nthe active stress. The resulting hydrodynamic instability leads to a state\ntermed active turbulence characterised by strong jets and vortices in the flow\nfield and the continual creation and annihilation of pairs of topological\ndefects. Lecture 4 compares simulations of active turbulence to experiments on\nsuspensions of microtubules and molecular motors. I introduce lyotropic active\nnematics and discuss active anchoring at interfaces.\n", "  The SW has undeniably been one of the most popular network descriptors in the\nneuroscience literature. Two main reasons for its lasting popularity are its\napparent ease of computation and the intuitions it is thought to provide on how\nnetworked systems operate. Over the last few years, some pitfalls of the SW\nconstruct and, more generally, of network summary measures, have widely been\nacknowledged.\n", "  Considering the intrinsic nonlinearity in a nanomechanical resonator coupled\nto a charge qubit, vacuum Rabi splitting effect is studied in a nanomechanical\nQED (qubit-resonator) system. A driven nonlinear Jaynes-Cummings model\ndescribes the dynamics of this qubit-resonator system. Using quantum regression\ntheorem and master equation approach, we have calculated the two-time\ncorrelation spectrum analytically. In the weak driving limit, these analytical\nresults clarify the influence of the driving strength and nonlinearity\nparameter on the correlation spectrum. Also, numerical calculations confirm\nthese analytical results.\n", "  Mercury Fulminate (MF) is one of the well-known primary explosives since 17th\ncentury and it has rendered invaluable service over many years. However, the\ncorrect molecular and crystal structures are determined recently after 300\nyears of its discovery. In the present study, we report pressure dependent\nstructural, elastic, electronic and optical properties of MF. Non-local\ncorrection methods have been employed to capture the weak van der Waals\ninteractions in layered and molecular energetic MF. Among the non-local\ncorrection methods tested, optB88-vdW method works well for the investigated\ncompound. The obtained equilibrium bulk modulus reveals that MF is softer than\nthe well known primary explosives Silver Fulminate (SF), silver azide and lead\nazide. MF exhibits anisotropic compressibility (b>a>c) under pressure,\nconsequently the corresponding elastic moduli decrease in the following order:\nC22>C11>C33. The structural and mechanical properties suggest that MF is more\nsensitive to detonate along c-axis (similar to RDX) due to high compressibility\nof Hg...O non-bonded interactions along that axis. Electronic structure and\noptical properties were calculated including spin-orbit (SO) interactions using\nfull potential linearized augmented plane wave method within recently developed\nTran-Blaha modified Becke-Johnson (TB-mBJ) potential. The calculated TB-mBJ\nelectronic structures of SF and MF show that these compounds are indirect\nbandgap insulators. Also, SO coupling is found to be more pronounced for 4d and\n5d-states of Ag and Hg atoms of SF and MF, respectively. Partial density of\nstates and electron charge density maps were used to describe the nature of\nchemical bonding. Ag-C bond is more directional than Hg-C bond which makes SF\nto be more unstable than MF. The effect of SO coupling on optical properties\nhas also been studied and found to be significant for both of the compounds.\n", "  During its first 2 years of mission the Fermi-LAT instrument discovered more\nthan 1,800 gamma-ray sources in the 100 MeV to 100 GeV range. Despite the\napplication of advanced techniques to identify and associate the Fermi-LAT\nsources with counterparts at other wavelengths, about 40% of the LAT sources\nhave no a clear identification remaining \"unassociated\". The purpose of my\nPh.D. work has been to pursue a statistical approach to identify the nature of\neach Fermi-LAT unassociated source. To this aim, we implemented advanced\nmachine learning techniques, such as logistic regression and artificial neural\nnetworks, to classify these sources on the basis of all the available gamma-ray\ninformation about location, energy spectrum and time variability. These\nanalyses have been used for selecting targets for AGN and pulsar searches and\nplanning multi-wavelength follow-up observations. In particular, we have\nfocused our attention on the search of possible radio-quiet millisecond pulsar\n(MSP) candidates in the sample of the Fermi-LAT unidentified sources. These\nobjects have not yet been detected but their discovery would have a formidable\nimpact for our understanding of the MSP gamma-ray emission mechanism.\n", "  In the present work, we report a detailed density functional theory\ncalculation on polymorphic InVO$_4$ phases by means of projector augmented wave\nmethod. The computed first-order structural phase transformation from\northorhombic \\emph{(Cmcm)} to monoclinic \\emph{(P2/c)} structure is found to\noccur around 5.6 GPa along with a large volume collapse of 16.6$\\%$, which is\nconsistent with previously reported experimental data. This transformation also\nleads to an increase in the coordination number of vanadium atom from 4 to 6.\nThe computed equilibrium and high pressure structural properties of both\nInVO$_4$ phases, including unit cell parameters, equation of state, and bulk\nmoduli, are in good agreement with the available experimental data. In\naddition, compressibility is found to be highly anisotropic and the\n\\emph{b}-axis being more compressible than the other for both the structures.\nElectronic band structures for both the phases were calculated, and the band\ngap for orthorhombic and monoclinic InVO$_4$ are found to be 4.02 and 1.67 eV,\nrespectively, within the Tran-Blaha Modified Becke-Johnson potential as\nimplemented in linearized augmented planewave method. We further examined the\noptical properties such as dielectric function, refractive index, and\nabsorption spectra for both the structures. From the implications of these\nresults, it can be proposed that the high pressure InVO$_4$ phase can be more\nuseful than orthorhombic phase for photo catalytic applications.\n", "  Since the time of the original Greenwood & Williamson paper, it was noticed\nthat abrasion and wear lead to possibly bimodal distribution of asperity height\ndistribution, with the upper tail of asperities following from the\ncharacteristics of the process. Using a limit case solution due to Borucki for\nthe wear of an originally Gaussian distribution, it is shown here that the tail\nis indeed always Gaussian, but with different equivalent parameters. Therefore,\nif the wear process is light, one obtains a bimodal distribution and both may\naffect the resulting contact mechanics behaviour. In this short note, we\nillustrate just the main features of the problem. We conclude that it is an\noversimplification to consider surfaces Gaussian.\n", "  We analyze plane waves in a model of quantum mechanics in a three dimensional\nnoncommutative (NC) space $R^3_{\\lambda}$. Signature features of NC models are\nimpossibility of probing distances smaller than a certain length scale\n{\\lambda} and a presence of natural energetic cut-off at energy scale of order\n$1/{\\lambda}^2$ (in convenient units). We analyze consequences of such\nrestrictions on a 1 dimensional Casimir effect. The result shows resemblance to\nflux tube potential for quark-antiquark pairs and to effective bosonic string\ntheories with L\\\"uscher terms. Such behavior might effect the radius of\npossible compact (fuzzy) dimensions.\n", "  In science, as in life, `surprises' can be adequately appreciated only in the\npresence of a null model, what we expect a priori. In physics, theories\nsometimes express the values of dimensionless physical constants as\ncombinations of mathematical constants like pi or e. The inverse problem also\narises, whereby the measured value of a physical constant admits a\n`surprisingly' simple approximation in terms of well-known mathematical\nconstants. Can we estimate the probability for this to be a mere coincidence,\nrather than an inkling of some theory? We answer the question in the most naive\nform.\n", "  We present a Rvachev function method with the Chebysev collocation for the\nstability analysis of fluid flow. The strategy is to construct an approximate\nsolution that satisfies all boundary conditions exactly. As an example, we\nconsider the stability problem of the two-dimensional flow of an incompressible\nviscous liquid near a circular cylinder. The results coincide well with the\nreference data. The method is simpler than the widely used spectral/hp element\nmethod, in particular because it does not require mesh generation, and the\ncollocation algorithm does not handle the boundary conditions or any geometric\ninformation.\n", "  Recent results of numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations suggest that in\ncollisionless space plasmas turbulence can spontaneously generate thin current\nsheets. These coherent structures can partially explain intermittency and the\nnon-homogenous distribution of localized plasma heating in turbulence. In this\nLetter Cluster multi-point observations are used to investigate the\ndistribution of magnetic field discontinuities and the associated small-scale\ncurrent sheets in the terrestrial magnetosheath downstream of a quasi-parallel\nbow shock. It is shown experimentally, for the first time, that the strongest\nturbulence generated current sheets occupy the long tails of probability\ndistribution functions (PDFs) associated with extremal values of magnetic field\npartial derivatives. During the analyzed one hour long time interval, about a\nhundred strong discontinuities, possibly proton-scale current sheets were\nobserved.\n", "  Basic theoretical and experimental aspects of neutrino magnetic moments are\nreviewed, including the present best upper bounds from reactor experiments and\nastrophysics. An interesting effect of neutrino spin precession and\noscillations induced by the background matter transversal current or\npolarization is also discussed.\n", "  The spectacular successes of quantum physics have made it a commonplace to\nassert that we live in a quantum world. This idea seems to imply a kind of\n\"quantum fundamentalism\" according to which everything in the universe (if not\nthe universe as a whole) is fundamentally of a quantum nature and ultimately\ndescribable in quantum-mechanical terms. Bohr's conception of quantum mechanics\nhas traditionally been seen as opposed to such a view, not least because of his\ninsistence on the necessity of the concepts of classical physics in the account\nof quantum phenomena. Recently, however, a consensus seems to be emerging among\ncareful commentators on Bohr to the effect that he, after all, did subscribe to\nsome version of quantum fundamentalism. Against this consensus, and by\nre-examining the historical record, I will defend a variant of the traditional\nreading of Bohr in which (1) the answer to what an object is (quantum or\nclassical) depends on the experimental context; and (2) in principle, any\nphysical system can be treated quantum-mechanically but not all systems can be\ntreated that way at the same time.\n", "  We predict a repulsive Casimir-Polder-type dispersion interaction between a\nsingle neutron and a metal or dielectric surface. Our model scenario assumes a\nsingle neutron subject to an external magnetic field. Due to its intrinsic\nmagnetic moment, the neutron then forms a magnetisable two-level system which\ncan exchange virtual photons with a nearby surface. The resulting dispersion\ninteraction between a purely magnetic object (neutron) and a purely electric\none (surface) is found to be repulsive. Its magnitude is considerably smaller\nthan than the standard atom-surface Casimir-Polder force due to the magnetic\nnature of the interaction and the smallness of the electron-to-neutron mass\nratio. Nevertheless, we show that it can be comparable to the gravitational\npotential of the same surface.\n", "  It is well known that Niels Bohr insisted on the necessity of classical\nconcepts in the account of quantum phenomena. But there is little consensus\nconcerning his reasons, and what he exactly meant by this. In this paper, I\nre-examine Bohr's interpretation of quantum mechanics, and argue that the\nnecessity of the classical can be seen as part of his response to the\nmeasurement problem. More generally, I attempt to clarify Bohr's view on the\nclassical/quantum divide, arguing that the relation between the two theories is\nthat of mutual dependence. An important element in this clarification consists\nin distinguishing Bohr's idea of the wave function as symbolic from both a\npurely epistemic and an ontological interpretation. Together with new evidence\nconcerning Bohr's conception of the wave function collapse, this sets his\ninterpretation apart from both standard versions of the Copenhagen\ninterpretation, and from some of the reconstructions of his view found in the\nliterature. I conclude with a few remarks on how Bohr's ideas make much sense\nalso when modern developments in quantum gravity and early universe cosmology\nare taken into account.\n", "  We present a review on the developments in the photoemission spectrometer\nwith a vacuum ultraviolet laser at Institute for Solid State Physics at the\nUniversity of Tokyo. The advantages of high energy resolution, high cooling\nability, and bulk sensitivity enable applications with a wide range of\nmaterials. We introduce some examples of fine electronic structures detected by\nlaser photoemission spectroscopy and discuss the prospects of research on\nlow-transition-temperature superconductors exhibiting unconventional\nsuperconductivity.\n", "  In this work, we present a study of the central regions of cool-core clusters\nhosting radio mini-halos, which are di use synchrotron sources extended on\ncluster-scales surrounding the radio-loud brightest galaxy. We aim to\ninvestigate the interplay between the thermal and non-thermal components in the\nintracluster medium in order to get more insights into these radio sources,\nwhose nature is still unclear. It has recently been proposed that turbulence\nplays a role for heating the gas in cool cores. A correlation between the radio\nluminosity of mini-halos, $\\nu P_{\\nu}$, and the cooling flow power, $P_{\\rm\nCF}$, is expected in the case that this turbulence also plays a role for the\nacceleration of the relativistic particles. We carried out a homogeneous\nre-analysis of X-ray Chandra data of the largest sample of cool-core clusters\nhosting radio mini-halos currently available ($\\sim20$ objects), finding a\nquasi-linear correlation, $\\nu P_{\\nu} \\propto P_{\\rm CF}^{0.8}$. We show that\nthe scenario of a common origin of radio mini-halos and gas heating in\ncool-core clusters is energetically viable, provided that mini-halos trace\nregions where the magnetic field strength is $B \\gg 0.5 \\mu G$.\n", "  For imaging of static object by the means of sequential repeated independent\nmeasurements, a theoretical modeling of the behavior of signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR) with varying number of measurement is developed, based on the information\ncapacity of optical imaging systems. Experimental veritification of imaging\nusing pseudo-thermal light source is implemented, for both the direct average\nof multiple measurements, and the image reconstructed by second order\nfluctuation correlation (SFC) which is closely related to ghost imaging.\nSuccessful curve fitting of data measured under different conditions verifies\nthe model.\n", "  The Maximum Energy Dissipation Principle (MEDP) for dynamics fracture, far\nfrom equilibrium, proposed by Slepyan was modified. This modification includes\na decoupling between the injected and dissipated energy by adding of a time\ndelay and a description of the ruggedness produced by dissipation patterns. A\ntime delayed energy conservation equation is deduced and dynamical equations\nthat describe the dynamical system evolution were obtained in analogous way to\nthe Slepyan's calculations. The conditions for the rising of the instability\nprocess were presented by a bifurcation map. These results shown that the\ntheoretical framework proposed can describe the instability process along with\ndissipation patterns formation. This proposal was applied to dynamics fracture\nwhere it was possible to explain the results obtained by Fineberg-Gross for the\nfast crack propagation in PMMA. For unstable or dynamical crack propagation it\nis shown the possibility to predict crack patterns using this MEDP for other\nexperimental configurations.\n", "  In this work, we studied the effect of the diameter of horizontal hydrophobic\ncylinders on droplet growth. We postulate that the concentration gradient\ncreated by natural convection around a horizontal circular cylinder is related\nto the droplet growth on the cylinder by condensation. We derive a simple\nscaling law of droplet growth and compare it with experimental results. The\npredicted negative exponent of drop diameter (d) as a function of cylinder\ndiameter (D) at different time points is similar to the general trend of\nexperimental data. Further, this effect of cylinder diameter on droplet growth\nis observed to be stronger than the supersaturation conditions created by\ndifferent surface temperatures.\n", "  We discover that the 26D open bosonic string scattering amplitudes (SSA) of\nthree tachyons and one arbitrary string state can be expressed in terms of the\nD-type Lauricella functions with associated SL(K+3,C) symmetry. As a result,\nSSA and symmetries or relations among SSA of different string states at various\nlimits calculated previously can be rederived. These include the linear\nrelations conjectured by Gross [1-3] and proved in [4-9] in the hard scattering\nlimit, the recurrence relations in the Regge scattering limit [14-16] and the\nextended recurrence relations in the nonrelativistic scattering limit [19]\ndiscovered recently. Finally, as an application, we calculate a new recurrence\nrelation of SSA which is valid for all energies.\n", "  There has been considerable efforts to understand the underlying complex\ndynamics in physiological time series. Methods originated from statistical\nphysics revealed a non-Gaussian statistics and long range correlations in those\nsignals. This suggests that the regulatory system operates out of equilibrium.\nHerein the complex fluctuations in blood pressure time series were successful\ndescribed by physiological motivated Langevin equation under a sigmoid\nrestoring force with multiplicative noise.\n", "  We present the preliminary results of an ongoing series of spectroscopic\nobservations of the Small Magellanic Cloud star LHA 115-S 18 (S18), which has\ndemonstrated extreme photospheric and spectroscopic variability that, in some\nrespects, is reminiscent of Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs). In contrast to our\npreviously published results, between 2012-2015 S18 remained in an spectral\nstate intermediate between S18's \"hot\" and \"cool\" extremes. In conjunction with\ncontemporaneous OGLE-IV photometric monitoring of S18, these data will be used\nto determine the characteristic timescale of the variability and search for\nperiodicities, in particular binary modulated periodicity. We also present the\nresults of a pilot study of the LMC star LHA 120-S 134.\n", "  Cornell, California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and Jet Propulsion Lab\n(JPL) have joined together to study development of a 25 meter sub-millimeter\ntelescope (CCAT) on a high peak in the Atacama region of northern Chile, where\nthe atmosphere is so dry as to permit observation at wavelengths as short as\n200 micron. The telescope is designed to deliver high efficiency images at that\nwavelength with a total 1/2 wavefront error of about 10 microns. With a 20 arc\nmin field of view, CCAT will be able to accommodate large format bolometer\narrays and will excel at carrying out surveys as well as resolving structures\nto the 2 arc sec. resolution level. The telescope will be an ideal complement\nto ALMA. Initial instrumentation will include both a wide field bolometer\ncamera and a medium resolution spectrograph. Studies of the major telescope\nsubsystems have been performed as part of an initial Feasibility Concept Study.\nNovel aspects of the telescope design include kinematic mounting and active\npositioning of primary mirror segments, high bandwidth secondary mirror segment\nmotion control for chopping, a Calotte style dome of 50 meter diameter, a mount\ncapable of efficient scanning modes of operation, and some new approaches to\npanel manufacture. Analysis of telescope performance and of key subsystems will\nbe presented to illustrate the technical feasibility and pragmatic cost of\nCCAT. Project plans include an Engineering Concept Design phase followed by\ndetailed design and development. First Light is planned for early 2012.\n", "  High resolution observations of 12CO (2.''3), 13CO (3.''9), and HCN (5.''4)\nJ=1--0 in the galaxy merger Arp 299 (IC 694 and NGC 3690) show the line ratios\nvary dramatically across the system. The 12CO/13CO ratio is unusually large, 60\n+- 15, at the IC 694 nucleus, where 12CO emission is very strong, and much\nsmaller, 10 +- 3, in the southern extended disk of that galaxy. Elsewhere, the\n12CO/13CO line ratio is 5-20, typical of spiral galaxies. The line ratio\nvariation in the overlap between the two galaxies is smaller, ranging from 10\n+- 3 in the east to 20 +- 4 in the west.\n  The 12CO/HCN line ratio also varies across Arp 299, although to a lesser\ndegree. HCN emission is bright towards each galaxy nucleus and in the\nextranuclear region of active star formation; it was not detected in the IC 694\ndisk, or the eastern part of the overlap region, leading to lower limits of 25\nand 20 respectively. By contrast, at the nuclei of IC 694 and NGC 3690 the\nratios are 9 +- 1 and 14 +- 3 respectively. In the western part of the overlap\nregion it is 11 +- 3.\n", "  New mechanism of magnetoresistivity in itinerant metamagnets with a\nstructural disorder is introduced basing on analysis of experimental results on\nmagnetoresistivity, susceptibility, and magnetization of structurally\ndisordered alloys (Y$_{1-x}$Gd$_{x}$)Co$_{2}$. In this series, YCo$_{2}$ is an\nenhanced Pauli paramagnet, whereas GdCo$_{2}$ is a ferrimagnet (T$_{\\rm c}$=400\nK) with Gd sublattice coupled antiferromagnetically to the itinerant Co-3d\nelectrons. The alloys are paramagnetic for $x < 0.12$. Large positive\nmagnetoresistivity has been observed in the alloys with magnetic ground state\nat temperatures T$<$T$_{\\rm c}$. We show that this unusual feature is linked to\na combination of structural disorder and metamagnetic instability of itinerant\nCo-3d electrons. This new mechanism of the magnetoresistivity is common for a\nbroad class of materials featuring a static magnetic disorder and itinerant\nmetamagnetism.\n", "  New similarity variables are introduced for the Einstein - Maxwell equations\nwith one Killing vector that reduce the non-linear partial differential\nequations in three independent variables to ordinary differential equations.\nThese similarity variables are the extensions of those previously found for the\nEinstein-Maxwell equations with two Killing vectors. The resulting equations\nare then solved, providing new solutions of the Einstein - Maxwell equations\nwith one Killing Vector.\n", "  The self-consistent separable RPA (random phase approximation) method is\nformulated for Skyrme forces with pairing. The method is based on a general\nself-consistent procedure for factorization of the two-body interaction. It is\nrelevant for various density- and current-dependent functionals. The\ncontributions of the time-even and time-odd Skyrme terms as well as of the\nCoulomb and pairing terms to the residual interaction are taken\nself-consistently into account. Most of the expression have a transparent\nanalytical form, which makes the method convenient for the treatment and\nanalysis. The separable character of the residual interaction allows to avoid\ndiagonalization of high-rank RPA matrices and thus to minimize the calculation\neffort. The previous studies have demonstrated high numerical accuracy and\nefficiency of the method for spherical nuclei. In this contribution, the method\nis specified for axial nuclei. We provide systematic and detailed presentation\nof formalism and discuss different aspects of the model.\n", "  We present a nonperturbative treatment of coherent backscattering of intense\nlaser light from cold atoms, and predict a nonvanishing backscattering signal\neven at very large intensities, due to the constructive (self-)interference of\ninelastically scattered photons.\n"]}
