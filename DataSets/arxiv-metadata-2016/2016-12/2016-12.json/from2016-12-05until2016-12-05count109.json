We also measured the mass\nfunction of the cluster down to a limiting magnitude of V~28 mag using archival\nHST/WFPC2 imaging. We derived the cluster's surface brightness profile based on\nthe WFPC2 data and on broad-band imaging with the Low-Resolution Imaging\nSpectrometer (LRIS) at the Keck II telescope. We find a mean cluster velocity\nof 72.55+/-0.22 km/s and a velocity dispersion of 0.87+/-0.18 km/s. The global\nmass function of the cluster, in the mass range 0.55<=M<=0.85 M_solar, is\nshallower than a Kroupa mass function and the cluster is significantly depleted\nin low-mass stars in its center compared to its outskirts. Since the relaxation\ntime of Pal 4 is of the order of a Hubble time, this points to primordial mass\nsegregation in this cluster. Extrapolating the measured mass function towards\nlower-mass stars and including the contribution of compact remnants, we derive\na total cluster mass of 29800 M_solar. For this mass, the measured velocity\ndispersion is consistent with the expectations of Newtonian dynamics and below\nthe prediction of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). Pal 4 adds to the growing\nbody of evidence that the dynamics of star clusters in the outer Galactic halo\ncan hardly be explained by MOND.\n", "  In this paper, we consider the short time classical solution to a simplified\nhydrodynamic flow modeling incompressible, nematic liquid crystal materials in\ndimension three. We establish a criterion for possible breakdown of such\nsolutions at a finite time. More precisely, if $(u,d)$ is smooth up to time $T$\nprovided that $\\int_0^T|\\nabla\\times u(t,\\cdot)|_{BMO(\\mathbb R^3)}+|\\nabla\nd(t,\\cdot)|^8_{L^4(\\mathbb R^3)}dt<\\infty $\n", "  We present an implementation of an efficient algorithm for the calculation of\nthe spectrum of one-dimensional quantum systems with periodic boundary\nconditions. This algorithm is based on a matrix product representation for\nquantum states (MPS), and a similar representation for Hamiltonians and other\noperators (MPO). It is significantly more efficient for systems of about 100\nsites and more than for small quantum systems. We apply the formalism to\ncalculate the ground state and first excited state of a spin-1 Heisenberg ring\nand deduce the size of the Haldane gap. The results are compared to previous\nhigh-precision DMRG calculations. Furthermore, we study spin-1 systems with a\nbiquadratic nearest-neighbor interaction and show first results of an\napplication to a mesoscopic Hubbard ring of spinless Fermions which carries a\npersistent current.\n", "  The Quantum Hall Effects offer a rich variety of theoretical and experimental\nadvances. They provide interesting insights on such topics as complementarity,\ngauge invariance, strong interactions, emergence of new theoretical concepts.\nThis paper focuses on some related philosophical questions. Hacking's views on\nScientific Realism, Chalmers' on Non Figurative Realism are discussed. It is\nargued that the difficulties with those versions of realism may be resolved\nwithin a dialectical materialist approach. The latter is shown to provide a\nrational approach to the phenomena, the theory and the ontology of the Quantum\nHall Effects.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to study asymptotic geometric properties almost\nsurely or/and in probability of extreme order statistics of an i.i.d. random\nfield (potential) indexed by sites of multidimensional lattice cube, the volume\nof which unboundedly increases. We discuss the following topics: (I) high level\nexceedances, in particular, clustering of exceedances; (II) decay rate of\nspacings in comparison with increasing rate of extreme order statistics; (III)\nminimum of spacings of successive order statistics; (IV) asymptotic behavior of\nvalues neighboring to extremes and so on. The conditions of the results are\nformulated in terms of regular variation (RV) of the cumulative hazard function\nand its inverse. A relationship between RV classes of the present paper as well\nas their links to the well-known RV classes (including domains of attraction of\nmax-stable distributions) are discussed.\n  The asymptotic behavior of functionals (I)--(IV) determines the asymptotic\nstructure of the top eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions of the\nlarge-volume discrete Schr\\\" odinger operators with an i.i.d. potential\n(Anderson Hamiltonian). Thus, another aim of the present paper is to review and\ncomment a recent progress on the extreme value theory for eigenvalues of random\nSchr\\\" odinger operators as well as to provide a clear and rigorous\nunderstanding of the relationship between the top eigenvalues and extreme\nvalues of i.i.d. random potentials. We also discuss their links to the\nlong-time intermittent behavior of the parabolic problems associated with the\nAnderson Hamiltonian via spectral representation of solutions.\n", "  In this work we present a novel approach to the ray optics limit: we rewrite\nthe dynamical Maxwell equations in Schr\\\"odinger form and prove Egorov-type\ntheorems, a robust semiclassical technique. We implement this scheme for\nperiodic light conductors, photonic crystals, thereby making the quantum-light\nanalogy between semiclassics for the Bloch electron and ray optics in photonic\ncrystals rigorous. Our main results, Theorems 3.3 and 4.1, give a ray optics\nlimit for quadratic observables and, among others, apply to local averages of\nenergy density, the Poynting vector and the Maxwell stress tensor. Ours is the\nfirst rigorous derivation of ray optics equations which include all sub-leading\norder terms, some of which are also new to the physics literature. While the\nray optics limit we prove initially (Theorem 3.3) applies to photonic crystals\nof any topological class, we also consider the ray optics limit for real\nelectromagnetic fields propagating in non-gyrotropic photonic crystals. Such an\nextension is non-trivial, because the ray optic limit for real fields is\nnecessarily a multiband problem.\n", "  The method of matched asymptotic expansions is used to study the canonical\nproblem of steady laminar flow through a narrow two-dimensional channel blocked\nby a tight-fitting finite-length highly permeable porous obstacle. We\ninvestigate the behaviour of the local flow close to the interface between the\nsingle-phase and porous regions (governed by the incompressible Navier--Stokes\nand Darcy flow equations, respectively). We solve for the flow in these inner\nregions in the limits of low and high Reynolds number, facilitating an\nunderstanding of the nature of the transition from Poiseuille to plug to\nPoiseuille flow in each of these limits. Significant analytic progress is made\nin the high-Reynolds-number limit, and we explore in detail the rich boundary\nlayer structure that occurs. We consider the three-dimensional generalization\nto unsteady laminar flow through and around a tight-fitting highly permeable\ncylindrical porous obstacle within a Hele-Shaw cell. For the\nhigh-Reynolds-number limit, we give the coupling conditions and interfacial\nstress in terms of the outer flow variables, allowing information from a\nnonlinear three-dimensional problem to be obtained by solving a linear\ntwo-dimensional problem. Finally, we illustrate the utility of our analysis by\nconsidering the specific example of time-dependent forced far-field flow in a\nHele-Shaw cell containing a porous cylinder with a circular cross-section. We\ndetermine the internal stress within the porous obstacle, which is key for\ntissue engineering applications, and the interfacial stress on the boundary of\nthe porous obstacle, which has applications to biofilm erosion. In the\nhigh-Reynolds-number limit, we demonstrate that the fluid inertia can result in\nthe cylinder experiencing a time-independent net force, even when the far-field\nforcing is periodic with zero mean.\n", "  We study the Compton scattering of x-rays off electrons that are driven by a\nrelativistically intense short optical laser pulse. The frequency spectrum of\nthe laser-assisted Compton radiation shows a broad plateau in the vicinity of\nthe laser-free Compton line due to a nonlinear mixing between x-ray and laser\nphotons. Special emphasis is placed on how the shape of the short assisting\nlaser pulse affects the spectrum of the scattered x-rays. In particular, we\nobserve sharp peak structures in the plateau region, whose number and locations\nare highly sensitive to the laser pulse shape. These structures are interpreted\nas spectral caustics by using a semiclassical analysis of the laser-assisted\nQED matrix element.\n", "  The large rate of multiple simultaneous proton--proton interactions, or\npile-up, generated by the Large Hadron Collider in Run 1 required the\ndevelopment of many new techniques to mitigate the adverse effects of these\nconditions. This paper describes the methods employed in the ATLAS experiment\nto correct for the impact of pile-up on jet energy and jet shapes, and for the\npresence of spurious additional jets, with a primary focus on the large 20.3\nfb$^{-1}$ data sample collected at a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s} = 8$\nTeV. The energy correction techniques that incorporate sophisticated estimates\nof the average pile-up energy density and tracking information are presented.\nJet-to-vertex association techniques are discussed and projections of\nperformance for the future are considered. Lastly, the extension of these\ntechniques to mitigate the effect of pile-up on jet shapes using subtraction\nand grooming procedures is presented.\n", "  The early development of conflicting theories about the microscopic mechanism\nof High Temperature Superconductivity is described. The biographical roots of\nthis diversity are stressed, as well as its subjective/objective roots. This\nstudy of a specific case of knowledge about a specific fact of nature allows to\ndiscuss the subjective and objective roots of scientific pluralism. Relativism,\nthe Duhem-Quine thesis on the underdetermination of theory by facts, are\ndiscussed from the stand point of the materialist view on the dialectics of\nknowledge and nature. Developments of dialectic materialism seem to be\nsuggested by this study.\n", "  Instantaneous non-local quantum computation requires multiple parties to\njointly perform a quantum operation, using pre-shared entanglement and a single\nround of simultaneous communication. We study this task for its close\nconnection to position-based quantum cryptography, but it also has natural\napplications in the context of foundations of quantum physics and in\ndistributed computing. The best known general construction for instantaneous\nnon-local quantum computation requires a pre-shared state which is\nexponentially large in the number of qubits involved in the operation, while\nefficient constructions are known for very specific cases only.\n  We partially close this gap by presenting new schemes for efficient\ninstantaneous non-local computation of several classes of quantum circuits,\nusing the Clifford+T gate set. Our main result is a protocol which uses\nentanglement exponential in the T-depth of a quantum circuit, able to perform\nnon-local computation of quantum circuits with a (poly-)logarithmic number of\nlayers of T gates with quasi-polynomial entanglement. Our proofs combine ideas\nfrom blind and delegated quantum computation with the garden-hose model, a\ncombinatorial model of communication complexity which was recently introduced\nas a tool for studying certain schemes for quantum position verification. As an\napplication of our results, we also present an efficient attack on a\nrecently-proposed scheme for position verification by Chakraborty and\nLeverrier.\n", "  A toy model where a massless, real, scalar field $\\Phi$ in a compact\nspace-time ${\\cal M}_4 \\times {\\cal S}_1$ is coupled to a brane (parametrized\nas a $\\delta$-function) through the unique relevant operator $\\delta (y) \\Phi^2\n(x,y)$ is considered. The exact Kaluza-Klein spectrum of the model is computed\nfor any value of the coupling between field and brane using the\nBurniston-Siewert method to solve analytically transcendental equations. The\nexact KK-spectrum of a model with a Brane-Localized Kinetic Term is also\ncomputed. Weak- and strong-coupling limits are derived, matching or extending\nmathematically equivalent existing results. For a negative coupling, the\nwould-be zero-mode $\\psi_{0^-}^e$ is found to localize into the brane, behaving\nas an effective four-dimensional field. The 4-dimensional KK-decomposition of\nthe model once a renormalizable cubic self-interaction $\\Phi^3 (x,y)$ is added\nto the action is derived computing the overlaps between the KK-modes. It is\nfound that the localized would-be zero-mode $\\psi_{0^-}^e$ decouples from the\nmassive KK-spectrum in the limit of large brane-to-bulk coupling.\n", "  In this paper Bianchi type I spacetimes are completely classified by their\nhomothetic vectors in the context of Lyra geometry. The non-linear coupled Lyra\nhomothetic equations are obtained and solved completely for different cases. In\nsome cases, Bianchi type I spacetimes admit proper Lyra homothetic vectors\n(LHVs) for special choices of the metric functions, while there exist other\ncases where the spacetime under consideration admits only Lyra Killing vectors\n(LKVs). In all the possible cases where Bianchi type I spacetimes admit proper\nLHVs or LKVs, we obtained homothetic and Killing vectors for Bianchi type I\nspacetimes in general relativity by taking the displacement vector of Lyra\ngeometry as zero. Matter collineation symmetry is explained by taking the\nmatter field as a perfect fluid. The obtained proper LHVs and LKVs are used in\nmatter collineation equations and a barotropic equation of state having\n$\\rho(t)\\,=\\,\\gamma\\,p(t)$, $0\\,\\leq\\,\\gamma\\,\\leq\\,1$ form is always obtained\nwhen the displacement vector is considered as a function of $t$ or treated as a\nconstant.\n", "  Progress in ultrafast electron microscopy relies on the development of\nefficient laser-driven electron sources delivering femtosecond electron pulses\nto the sample. In particular, recent advances employ photoemission from metal\nnanotips as coherent point-like femtosecond low-energy electron sources. We\nreport the nonlinear emission of ultrashort electron wave packets from a gold\nnanotip generated by nonlocal excitation and nanofocusing of surface plasmon\npolaritons. We verify the nanoscale localization of plasmon-induced electron\nemission by its electrostatic collimation characteristics. With a plasmon\npolariton pulse duration below 8 fs at the apex, we identify multiphoton\nphotoemission as the underlying emission process. The quantum efficiency of the\nplasmon-induced emission exceeds that of photoemission from direct apex\nillumination. We demonstrate the application for plasmon-triggered\npoint-projection imaging of an individual semiconductor nanowire at 3 $\\mu$m\ntip-sample distance. Based on numerical simulations we estimate an electron\npulse duration at the sample below 10 fs for tip-sample distances up to few\nmicrometers. Plasmon-driven nanolocalized electron emission thus enables\nfemtosecond point-projection microscopy with unprecedented temporal and spatial\nresolution, femtosecond low-energy electron in-line holography, and opens a new\nroute towards femtosecond scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy.\n", "  The supporting forces of all the legs have been simultaneously measured\nthrough a natural phenomenon inspired shadow method, by capturing water strider\nleg shadows to calculate the expelled water volume and the equivalent floating\nforces according to Archimedes' principle, with a sensitivity up to\nnN~pN/pixel. The method was verified by comparing to electronic balance to\nweight water striders. The supporting force acted on legs was found to linearly\nproportional to its shadow area, which geometry clearly indicated the\nhydrophobicity of legs. The pressed depth of legs, vertical weight focus\nposition change and body pitch angle during leg refreshing, sculling and\njumping forward of water striders have been achieved with resolutions of\n5um/pixel, 2 um/pixel, and 0.02 degree, respectively, which is difficult for\ngeneral imaging technologies. The shadow method was also developed into a force\nmeasuring device and characterized the adhesion force of a hair/polymer surface\ncontact in a few uN with a 0.3 nN/pixel resolution.\n", "  We have numerically simulated quantum tomography of single-qubit and\ntwo-qubit quantum gates with qubits represented by mesoscopic ensembles\ncontaining random numbers of atoms. Such ensembles of strongly interacting\natoms in the regime of Rydberg blockade are known as Rydberg superatoms. The\nStimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) in the regime of Rydberg blockade\nis used for deterministic Rydberg excitation in the ensemble, required for\nstorage of quantum information in the collective state of the atomic ensemble\nand implementation of two-qubit gates. The optimized shapes of the STIRAP\npulses are used to achieve high fidelity of the population transfer. Our\nsimulations confirm validity and high fidelity of single-qubit and two-qubit\ngates with Rydberg superatoms.\n", "  We present the C++ program library mr that allows us to reliably calculate\nthe values of the running parameters in the Standard Model at high energy\nscales. The initial conditions are obtained by relating the running parameters\nin the $\\overline{\\mathrm{MS}}$ renormalization scheme to observables at lower\nenergies with full two-loop precision. The evolution is then performed in\naccordance with the renormalization group equations with full three-loop\nprecision. Pure QCD corrections to the matching and running are included\nthrough four loops. We also provide a Mathematica interface for this program\nlibrary.\n", "  Spatially-dense pressure measurements are needed on curved surfaces in marine\nenvironments to provide marine vehicles with the detailed, real-time\nmeasurements of the near-field flow necessary to improve performance through\nflow control. To address this challenge, a waterproof and conformal pressure\nsensor array comprising carbon black-doped-silicone closed-cell foam (CBPDMS\nfoam) was developed for use in marine applications. The response of the CBPDMS\nfoam sensor arrays was characterized using periodic hydrodynamic pressure\nstimuli from vertical plunging, from which a piecewise polynomial calibration\nwas developed to describe the sensor response. Inspired by the distributed\npressure and velocity sensing capabilities of the fish lateral line, the CBPDMS\nfoam sensor arrays have significant advantages over existing commercial sensors\nfor distributed flow reconstruction and control. Experimental results have\nshown the sensor arrays to have sensitivity on the order of 5 Pascal, dynamic\nrange of 50-500 Pascal; are contained in a waterproof and completely flexible\npackage, and have material cost less than $10 per sensor.\n", "  To elucidate the magnetic structure and the origin of the nematicity in FeSe,\nwe perform a high-pressure $^{77}$Se NMR study on FeSe single crystals. We find\na suppression of the structural transition temperature with pressure up to\nabout 2 GPa from the anisotropy of the Knight shift. Above 2 GPa, a\nstripe-order antiferromagnetism that breaks the spatial four-fold rotational\nsymmetry is determined by the NMR spectra under different field orientations\nand with temperatures down to 50 mK. The magnetic phase transition is revealed\nto be first-order type, implying the existence of a concomitant structural\ntransition via a spin-lattice coupling. Stripe-type spin fluctuations are\nobserved at high temperatures, and remain strong with pressure. These results\nprovide clear evidences for strong coupling between nematicity and magnetism in\nFeSe, and therefore support a universal scenario of magnetic driven nematicity\nin iron-based superconductors.\n", "  We numerically study the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model with\nGaussian couplings, focusing on the heterogeneities arising in its\nnonequilibrium dynamics. Results are analyzed in terms of the backbone picture,\nwhich links strong dynamical heterogeneities to spatial heterogeneities\nemerging from the correlation of local rigidity of the bond network. Different\ntwo-times quantities as the flipping time distribution and the correlation and\nresponse functions, are evaluated over the full system and over high- and\nlow-rigidity regions. We find that the nonequilibrium dynamics of the model is\nhighly correlated to spatial heterogeneities. Also, we observe a similar\nphysical behavior to that previously found in the Edwards-Anderson model with a\nbimodal (discrete) bond distribution. Namely, the backbone behaves as the main\nstructure that supports the spin-glass phase, within which a sort of\ndomain-growth process develops, while the complement remains in a paramagnetic\nphase, even below the critical temperature.\n", "  To elucidate the non-trivial empirical statistical properties of fluctuations\nof a typical non-steady time series representing the appearance of words in\nblogs, we investigated approximately five billion Japanese blogs over a period\nof six years and analyse some corresponding mathematical models. First, we\nintroduce a solvable non-steady extension of the random diffusion model, which\ncan be deduced by modelling the behaviour of heterogeneous random bloggers.\nNext, we deduce theoretical expressions for both the temporal and ensemble\nfluctuation scalings of this model, and demonstrate that these expressions can\nreproduce all empirical scalings over eight orders of magnitude. Furthermore,\nwe show that the model can reproduce other statistical properties of time\nseries representing the appearance of words in blogs, such as functional forms\nof the probability density and correlations in the total number of blogs. As an\napplication, we quantify the abnormality of special nationwide events by\nmeasuring the fluctuation scalings of 1771 basic adjectives.\n", "  Quantum spin liquids form a novel class of matter where, despite the\nexistence of strong exchange interactions, spins do not order down to the\nlowest measured temperature. Typically, these occur in lattices that act to\nfrustrate the appearance of magnetism. In two dimensions, the classic example\nis the kagome lattice composed of corner sharing triangles. There are a variety\nof minerals whose transition metal ions form such a lattice. Hence, a number of\nthem have been studied, and were then subsequently synthesized in order to\nobtain more pristine samples. Of particular note was the report in 2005 by Dan\nNocera's group of the synthesis of herbertsmithite, composed of a lattice of\ncopper ions sitting on a kagome lattice, which indeed does not order down to\nthe lowest measured temperature despite the existence of a large exchange\ninteraction of 17 meV. Over the past decade, this material has been extensively\nstudied, yielding a number of intriguing surprises that have in turn motivated\na resurgence of interest in the theoretical study of the spin 1/2 Heisenberg\nmodel on a kagome lattice. In this colloquium article, I will review these\ndevelopments, and then discuss potential future directions, both experimental\nand theoretical, as well as the challenge of doping these materials with the\nhope that this could lead to the discovery of novel topological and\nsuperconducting phases.\n", "  The most fundamental properties of quantum entropy are derived by considering\nthe union of two ensembles. We discuss the limits these properties put on an\nentropy measure and obtain that they uniquely determine the form of the entropy\nfunctional up to normalisation. In particular, the result implies that all\nother properties of quantum entropy may be derived from these first principles.\n", "  The scale factor duality is a symmetry of dilaton gravity which is known to\nlead to pre-big-bang cosmologies. A conformal time version of the scale factor\nduality (SFD) was recently implemented as a UV/IR symmetry between decelerated\nand accelerated phases of the post-big-bang evolution within Einstein gravity\ncoupled to a scalar field. The problem investigated in the present paper\nconcerns the employment of the conformal time SFD methods to the construction\nof pre-big-bang and cyclic extensions of these models. We demonstrate that each\nbig-bang model gives rise to two qualitatively different pre-big-bang\nevolutions: a contraction/expansion SFD model and Penrose's Conformal Cyclic\nCosmology (CCC). A few examples of SFD symmetric cyclic universes involving\ncertain gauged K\\\"ahler sigma models minimally coupled to Einstein gravity are\nstudied. We also describe the specific SFD features of the thermodynamics and\nthe conditions for validity of the generalized second law in the case of\nGauss-Bonnet (GB) extension of these selected CCC models.\n", "  Dotsenko-Fateev and Chern-Simons matrix models, which describe Nekrasov\nfunctions for SYM theories in different dimensions, are all incorporated into\nnetwork matrix models with the hidden Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) symmetry. This\nlifting is especially simple for what we call balanced networks. Then, the Ward\nidentities (known under the names of Virasoro/W-constraints or loop equations\nor regularity condition for qq-characters) are also promoted to the DIM level,\nwhere they all become corollaries of a single identity.\n", "  We show that the critical point of the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model can\nbe easily found through studies of either on-site atom number fluctuations or\nthe nearest-neighbor two-point correlation function (the expectation value of\nthe tunnelling operator). Our strategy to locate the critical point is based on\nthe observation that the derivatives of these observables with respect to the\nparameter that drives the superfluid-Mott insulator transition are singular at\nthe critical point in the thermodynamic limit. Performing the quantum Monte\nCarlo simulations of the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, we show that this\ntechnique leads to the accurate determination of the position of its critical\npoint. Our results can be easily extended to the three-dimensional Bose-Hubbard\nmodel and different Hubbard-like models. They provide a simple\nexperimentally-relevant way of locating critical points in various cold atomic\nlattice systems.\n", "  Depletion forces exerted by self-propelled particles on circular and\nelliptical passive objects are studied using numerical simulations. We show\nthat a bath of active particles can induce repulsive and attractive forces\nwhich are sensitive to the shape and orientation of the passive objects (either\nhorizontal or vertical ellipses). The resultant force on the passive objects\ndue to the active particles is studied as a function of the shape and\norientation of the passive objects, magnitude of the angular noise, distance\nbetween the passive objects. By increasing the distance between obstacles the\nmagnitude of the repulsive depletion force increases, as long as such a\ndistance is less than one active particle diameter. For longer distances, the\nmagnitude of the force always decrease with increasing distance. We also found\nthat attractive forces may arise for vertical ellipses at high enough area\nfraction.\n", "  We compare the reconstructed hadronization conditions in relativistic nuclear\ncollisions in the nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy range 4.7-2760 GeV in\nterms of temperature and baryon-chemical potential with lattice QCD\ncalculations, by using hadronic multiplicities. We obtain hadronization\ntemperatures and baryon chemical potentials with a fit to measured\nmultiplicities by correcting for the effect of post-hadronization rescattering.\nThe post-hadronization modification factors are calculated by means of a\ncoupled hydrodynamical-transport model simulation under the same conditions of\napproximate isothermal and isochemical decoupling as assumed in the statistical\nhadronization model fits to the data. The fit quality is considerably better\nthan without rescattering corrections, as already found in previous work. The\ncurvature of the obtained \"true\" hadronization pseudo-critical line kappa is\nfound to be 0.0048 +- 0.0026, in agreement with lattice QCD estimates; the\npseudo-critical temperature at vanishing mu_B is found to be 164.3+-1.8 MeV.\n", "  The unsteady response of a water free surface to a localized pressure source\nmoving at constant speed $U$ in the range $0.95c_\\mathrm{min} \\lesssim U \\leq\n1.02 c_\\mathrm{min}$, where $c_\\mathrm{min}$ is the minimum phase speed of\nlinear gravity-capillary waves in deep water, is investigated through\nexperiments and numerical simulations. This unsteady response state, which\nconsists of a V-shaped pattern behind the source and features periodic shedding\nof pairs of depressions from the tips of the V, was first observed\nqualitatively by Diorio et al. (Phys. Rev. Let., 103, 214502, 2009) and called\nstate III. In the present investigation, cinematic shadowgraph and\nrefraction-based techniques are utilized to measure the temporal evolution of\nthe free surface deformation pattern downstream of the source as it moves along\na towing tank, while numerical simulations of the model equation described by\nCho et al. (J. Fluid Mech., 672, 288-306, 2011) are used to extend the\nexperimental results over longer times than are possible in the experiments.\nFrom the experiments, it is found that the speed-amplitude characteristics and\nthe shape of the depressions are nearly the same as those of the freely\npropagating gravity-capillary lumps of inviscid potential theory. The decay\nrate of the depressions is measured from their height-time characteristics,\nwhich are well fitted by an exponential decay law with an order 1 decay\nconstant. It is found that the shedding period of the depression pairs\ndecreases with increasing source strength and speed. As the source speed\napproaches $c_\\mathrm{min}$, this period tends to about 1~s for all source\nmagnitudes. At the low-speed boundary of state III, a new response with\nunsteady asymmetric shedding of depressions is found. This response is also\npredicted by the model equation.\n", "  Time is a parameter playing a central role in our most fundamental modelling\nof natural laws. Relativity theory shows that the comparison of times measured\nby different clocks depends on their relative motions and on the strength of\nthe gravitational field in which they are embedded. In standard cosmology, the\ntime parameter is the one measured by fundamental clocks, i.e. clocks at rest\nwith respect to the expanding space. This proper time is assumed to flow at a\nconstant rate throughout the whole history of the Universe. We make the\nalternative hypothesis that the rate at which cosmological time flows depends\non the global geometric curvature the Universe. Using a simple one-parameter\nmodel for the relation between proper time and curvature, we build a\ncosmological model that fits the Type Ia Supernovae data (the best cosmological\nstandard candles) without the need for dark energy nor probably exotic dark\nmatter.\n", "  We evaluate the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux at high energies using three\ndifferent frameworks for calculating the heavy quark production cross section\nin QCD: NLO perturbative QCD, $k_T$ factorization including low-$x$\nresummation, and the dipole model including parton saturation. We use QCD\nparameters, the value for the charm quark mass and the range for the\nfactorization and renormalization scales that provide the best description of\nthe total charm cross section measured at fixed target experiments, at RHIC and\nat LHC. Using these parameters we calculate differential cross sections for\ncharm and bottom production and compare with the latest data on forward charm\nmeson production from LHCb at $7$ TeV and at $13$ TeV, finding good agreement\nwith the data. In addition, we investigate the role of nuclear shadowing by\nincluding nuclear parton distribution functions (PDF) for the target air\nnucleus using two different nuclear PDF schemes. Depending on the scheme used,\nwe find the reduction of the flux due to nuclear effects varies from $10\\%$ to\n$50 \\%$ at the highest energies. Finally, we compare our results with the\nIceCube limit on the prompt neutrino flux, which is already providing valuable\ninformation about some of the QCD models.\n", "  The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a future space-based\ninterferometric gravitational-wave detector consisting of three spacecraft in a\ntriangular configuration. The interferometric measurements of path length\nchanges between satellites will be performed on optical benches in the\nsatellites. Angular misalignments of the interfering beams couple into the\nlength measurement and represent a significant noise source. Imaging systems\nwill be used to reduce this tilt-to-length coupling.\n  We designed and constructed an optical test bed to experimentally investigate\ntilt-to-length coupling. It consists of two separate structures, a minimal\noptical bench and a telescope simulator. The minimal optical bench comprises\nthe science interferometer where the local laser is interfered with light from\na remote spacecraft. In our experiment, a simulated version of this received\nbeam is generated on the telescope simulator. The telescope simulator provides\na tilting beam, a reference interferometer and an additional static beam as a\nphase reference. The tilting beam can either be a flat-top beam or a Gaussian\nbeam. We avoid tilt-to-length coupling in the reference interferometer by using\na small photo diode placed at an image of the beam rotation point. We show that\nthe test bed is operational with an initial measurement of tilt-to-length\ncoupling without imaging systems.\n  Furthermore, we show the design of two different imaging systems whose\nperformance will be investigated in future experiments.\n", "  We calculate one-loop contributions to the two and three point spinor-vector\nfunctions in z=2 Horava-Lifshitz QED. This allows us to obtain the anomalous\nmagnetic moment.\n", "  We present an apparatus for terahertz fingerprint discrimination of materials\ndesigned to be fast, simple, compact and economical in order to be suitable for\npreliminary on-field analysis. The system working principles, bioinspired by\nthe human vision of colors, are based on the use of microfabricated\nmetamaterials selective filters and of a very compact optics based on metallic\nellipsoidal mirrors in air. We experimentally demonstrate the operation of the\napparatus in discriminating simple substances such as salt, staple foods and\ngrease in an accurate and reproducible manner. We present the system and the\nobtained results and discuss issues and possible developments.\n", "  The top squarks (stops) may be the most wanted particles after the Higgs\nboson discovery. The searches for the lightest stop have put strong constraints\non its mass. However, there is still a search gap in the low mass region if the\nspectrum of the stop and the lightest neutralino is compressed. In that case,\nit may be easier to look for the second stop since naturalness requires both\nstops to be close to the weak scale. The current experimental searches for the\nsecond stop are based on the simplified model approach with the decay modes\n$\\tilde{t}_2 \\to \\tilde{t}_1 Z$ and $\\tilde{t}_2 \\to \\tilde{t}_1 h$. However,\nin a realistic supersymmetric spectrum there is always a sbottom lighter than\nthe second stop, hence the decay patterns are usually more complicated than the\nsimplified model assumptions. In particular, there are often large branching\nratios of the decays $\\tilde{t}_2 \\to \\tilde{b}_1 W$ and $\\tilde{b}_1 \\to\n\\tilde{t}_1 W$ as long as they are open. The decay chains can be even more\ncomplex if there are intermediate states of additional charginos and\nneutralinos in the decays. By studying several MSSM benchmark models at the 14\nTeV LHC, we point out the importance of the multi-$W$ final states in the\nsecond stop and the sbottom searches, such as the same-sign dilepton and\nmultilepton signals, aside from the traditional search modes. The observed\nsame-sign dilepton excesses at LHC Run 1 and Run 2 may be explained by some of\nour benchmark models. We also suggest that the vector boson tagging and a new\nkinematic variable may help to suppress the backgrounds and increase the signal\nsignificance for some search channels. Due to the complex decay patterns and\nlack of the dominant decay channels, the best reaches likely require a\ncombination of various search channels at the LHC for the second stop and the\nlightest sbottom.\n", "  A measurement is presented of the cross section for the electroweak\nproduction of a W boson in association with two jets in proton-proton\ncollisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV. The data set was collected with\nthe CMS detector and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.3 inverse\nfemtobarns. The measured fiducial cross section for W bosons decaying to\nelectrons or muons and for pT(j1) > 60 GeV, pT(j2) > 50 GeV, |eta(j)| < 4.7,\nand m(jj) > 1000 GeV is 0.42 +/- 0.04 (stat) +/- 0.09 (syst) +/- 0.01 (lumi)\npb. This result is consistent with the standard model leading-order prediction\nof 0.50 +/- 0.02 (scale) +/- 0.02 (PDF) pb obtained with MADGRAPH5_aMC@NLO 2.1\ninterfaced to PYTHIA 6.4. This is the first cross section measurement for this\nprocess.\n", "  Observations of gravitational lenses in strong gravitational fields give us a\nclue to understanding dark compact objects. In this paper, we extend a method\nto obtain a deflection angle in a strong deflection limit provided by Bozza\n[Phys. Rev. D 66, 103001 (2002)] to apply to ultrastatic spacetimes. We also\ndiscuss on the order of an error term in the deflection angle. Using the\nimproved method, we consider gravitational lensing by an Ellis wormhole, which\nis an ultrastatic wormhole of the Morris-Thorne class.\n", "  In the context of Standard Model Extensions (SMEs), we analyse four general\nclasses of Super Symmetry (SuSy) and Lorentz Symmetry (LoSy) breaking, leading\nto {observable} imprints at our energy scales. The photon dispersion relations\nshow a non-Maxwellian behaviour for the CPT (Charge-Parity-Time reversal\nsymmetry) odd and even sectors. The group velocities exhibit also a directional\ndependence with respect to the breaking background vector (odd CPT) or tensor\n(even CPT). In the former sector, the group velocity may decay following an\ninverse squared frequency behaviour. Thus, we extract a massive and gauge\ninvariant Carroll-Field-Jackiw photon term in the Lagrangian and show that the\nmass is proportional to the breaking vector. The latter is estimated by ground\nmeasurements and leads to a photon mass upper limit of $10^{-19}$ eV or $2\n\\times 10^{-55}$ kg and thereby to a potentially measurable delay at low radio\nfrequencies.\n", "  We consider the possible decay of the inflaton into curvaton particles during\nreheating and analyse its effect on curvaton scenarios. Typical decay curvatons\nare initially relativistic then become non-relativistic, changing the\nbackground history of the Universe. We show that this change to the background\nis the only way in which observational predictions of the scenario are\nmodified. Moreover, once the required amplitude of perturbations is fixed by\nobservation there are no signatures of such decays in other cosmological\nobservables. The decay curvatons can prevent the Universe from becoming\ndominated by the curvaton condensate, making it impossible to match\nobservations in parts of parameter space. This constrains the branching ratio\nof the inflaton to curvaton to be less than of order $0.1$ typically. If the\nbranching ratio is below about $10^{-4}$ it has negligible impact on the model\nparameter space and can be ignored.\n", "  We perform microscopic molecular dynamics simulations of particle chains with\nan onsite anharmonicity to study relaxation of spatially homogeneous states to\nequilibrium, and directly compare the simulations with the corresponding\nBoltzmann-Peierls kinetic theory. The Wigner function serves as common\ninterface between the microscopic and kinetic level. We demonstrate\nquantitative agreement after an initial transient time interval. In particular,\nbesides energy conservation, we observe the additional quasi-conservation of\nthe phonon density, defined via an ensemble average of the related microscopic\nfield variables and exactly conserved by the kinetic equations. On\nsuper-kinetic time scales, density quasi-conservation is lost while energy\nremains conserved, and we find evidence for eventual relaxation of the density\nto its canonical ensemble value. However, the precise mechanism remains unknown\nand is not captured by the Boltzmann-Peierls equations.\n", "  Within a plane-wave approach, a number of scattering events in a collision is\ninsensitive to a general phase of a transition amplitude, although this phase\nis extremely important for a number of problems, especially in hadronic\nphysics. In reality the particles are better described as wave packets, and\nhere we show that the observables grow dependent upon this phase if one lays\naside the simplified plane-wave model. We discuss two methods for probing how\nthe Coulomb- and hadronic phases change with a transferred momentum $t$, either\nby colliding two beams at a non-vanishing impact-parameter or by employing such\nnovel states as the vortex particles carrying orbital angular momentum or the\nAiry beams. For electron-electron collision, the phase contribution to a cross\nsection can reach the values higher than $10^{-4} -- 10^{-3}$ for well-focused\nbeams with energies of hundreds of keV.\n", "  Inspired by language competition processes, we present a model of coupled\nevolution of node and link states. In particular, we focus on the interplay\nbetween the use of a language and the preference or attitude of the speakers\ntowards it, which we model, respectively, as a property of the interactions\nbetween speakers (a link state) and as a property of the speakers themselves (a\nnode state). Furthermore, we restrict our attention to the case of two socially\nequivalent languages and to socially inspired network topologies based on a\nmechanism of triadic closure. As opposed to most of the previous literature,\nwhere language extinction is an inevitable outcome of the dynamics, we find a\nbroad range of possible asymptotic configurations, which we classify as: frozen\nextinction states, frozen coexistence states, and dynamically trapped\ncoexistence states. Moreover, metastable coexistence states with very long\nsurvival times and displaying a non-trivial dynamics are found to be abundant.\nInterestingly, a system size scaling analysis shows, on the one hand, that the\nprobability of language extinction vanishes exponentially for increasing system\nsizes and, on the other hand, that the time scale of survival of the\nnon-trivial dynamical metastable states increases linearly with the size of the\nsystem. Thus, non-trivial dynamical coexistence is the only possible outcome\nfor large enough systems. Finally, we show how this coexistence is\ncharacterized by one of the languages becoming clearly predominant while the\nother one becomes increasingly confined to \"ghetto-like\" structures: small\ngroups of bilingual speakers arranged in triangles, with a strong preference\nfor the minority language, and using it for their intra-group interactions\nwhile they switch to the predominant language for communications with the rest\nof the population.\n", "  We study a generalization of the loosely bound Skyrme model which consists of\nthe Skyrme model with a sixth-order derivative term - motivated by its\nfluid-like properties - and the second-order loosely bound potential -\nmotivated by lowering the classical binding energies of higher-charged\nSkyrmions. We use the rational map approximation for the Skyrmion of\ntopological charge B=4, calculate the binding energy of the latter and estimate\nthe systematic error in using this approximation. In the parameter space that\nwe can explore within the rational map approximation, we find classical binding\nenergies as low as 1.8% and once taking into account the contribution from\nspin-isospin quantization we obtain binding energies as low as 5.3%. We also\ncalculate the contribution from the sixth-order derivative term to the electric\ncharge density and axial coupling.\n", "  Chlorine abundances are reported in 15 evolved giants and one M dwarf in the\nsolar neighborhood. The Cl abundance was measured using the vibration-rotation\n1-0 P8 line of H$^{35}$Cl at 3.69851 $\\mu$m. The high resolution L-band spectra\nwere observed using the Phoenix infrared spectrometer on the Kitt Peak Mayall\n4m telescope. The average [$^{35}$Cl/Fe] abundance in stars with\n--0.72$<$[Fe/H]$<$0.20 is [$^{35}$Cl/Fe]=(--0.10$\\pm$0.15) dex. The mean\ndifference between the [$^{35}$Cl/Fe] ratios measured in our stars and chemical\nevolution model values is (0.16$\\pm$0.15) dex. The [$^{35}$Cl/Ca] ratio has an\noffset of $\\sim$0.35 dex above model predictions suggesting chemical evolution\nmodels are under producing Cl at the high metallicity range. Abundances of C,\nN, O, Si, and Ca were also measured in our spectral region and are consistent\nwith F and G dwarfs. The Cl versus O abundances from our sample match Cl\nabundances measured in planetary nebula and \\ion{H}{2} regions. In one star\nwhere both H$^{35}$Cl and H$^{37}$Cl could be measured, a $^{35}$Cl/$^{37}$Cl\nisotope ratio of 2.2$\\pm$0.4 was found, consistent with values found in the\nGalactic ISM and predicted chemical evolution models.\n", "  We determine the frequency of the Yb I $^1S_0 - ^1P_1$ transition at 399 nm\nusing an optical frequency comb. Although this transition was measured\npreviously using an optical transfer cavity [D. Das et al., Phys. Rev. A 72,\n032506 (2005)], recent work has uncovered significant errors in that method. We\ncompare our result of 751 526 533.49 $\\pm$ 0.33 MHz for the Yb-174 isotope with\nthose from the literature and discuss observed differences. We verify the\ncorrectness of our method by measuring the frequencies of well-known\ntransitions in Rb and Cs, and by demonstrating proper control of systematic\nerrors in both laser metrology and atomic spectroscopy. We also demonstrate the\neffect of quantum interference due to hyperfine structure in a divalent atomic\nsystem and present isotope shift measurements for all stable isotopes.\n", "  We investigate lattice effects on wave functions that are lattice analogues\nof bosonic and fermionic Laughlin wave functions with number of particles per\nflux $\\nu=1/q$ in the Landau levels. These wave functions are defined\nanalytically on lattices with $\\mu$ particles per lattice site, where $\\mu$ may\nbe different than $\\nu$. We give numerical evidence that these states have the\nsame topological properties as the corresponding continuum Laughlin states for\ndifferent values of $q$ and for different fillings $\\mu$. These states define,\nin particular, particle-hole symmetric lattice Fractional Quantum Hall states\nwhen the lattice is half-filled. On the square lattice it is observed that for\n$q\\leq 4$ this particle-hole symmetric state displays the topological\nproperties of the continuum Laughlin state at filling fraction $\\nu=1/q$, while\nfor larger $q$ there is a transition towards long-range ordered\nanti-ferromagnets. This effect does not persist if the lattice is deformed from\na square to a triangular lattice, or on the Kagome lattice, in which case the\ntopological properties of the state are recovered. We then show that changing\nthe number of particles while keeping the expression of these wave functions\nidentical gives rise to edge states that have the same correlations in the bulk\nas the reference lattice Laughlin states but a different density at the edge.\nWe derive an exact parent Hamiltonian for which all these edge states are\nground states with different number of particles. In addition this Hamiltonian\nadmits the reference lattice Laughlin state as its unique ground state of\nfilling factor $1/q$. Parent Hamiltonians are also derived for the lattice\nLaughlin states at other fillings of the lattice, when $\\mu\\leq 1/q$ or\n$\\mu\\geq 1-1/q$ and when $q=4$ also at half-filling.\n", "  This is the second in a series of papers associated with cataclysmic\nvariables (CVs) and related objects, formed in a suite of simulations for\nglobular cluster evolution performed with the MOCCA Monte Carlo code. We study\nthe properties of our simulated CV populations throughout the entire cluster\nevolution. We find that dynamics extends the range of binary CV progenitor\nproperties, causing CV formation from binary progenitors that would otherwise\nnot become CVs. The CV formation rate in our simulations can be separated into\ntwo regimes: an initial burst ($\\lesssim$ 1 Gyr) connected with the formation\nof the most massive white dwarfs, followed by a nearly constant formation rate.\nThis result holds for all models regardless of the adopted initial conditions,\neven when most CVs form dynamically. Given the cluster age-dependence of CV\nproperties, we argue that direct comparisons to observed Galactic field CVs\ncould be misleading, since cluster CVs can be up to 4 times older than their\nfield counterparts. Our results also illustrate that, due mainly to unstable\nmass transfer, some CVs that form in our simulations are destroyed before the\npresent-day. Finally, some field CVs might have originated from globular\nclusters, as found in our simulations, although the fraction of such escapers\nshould be small relative to the entire Galactic field CV population.\n", "  New reductions of the 2D Toda equations associated with low-triangular\ndifference operators are proposed. Their explicit Hamiltonian description is\nobtained.\n", "  Using the fact that Miura transformation can be expressed in the form of\ngauge transformation connecting the KdV and mKdV equations, we discuss the\nderivation of the B\\\"acklund transformation and its Miura-gauge transformation\nconnecting both hierarchies.\n", "  Numerous systems ranging from deformation of materials to earthquakes exhibit\nbursty dynamics, which consist of a sequence of events with a broad event size\ndistribution. Very often these events are observed to be temporally correlated\nor clustered, evidenced by power-law distributed waiting times separating two\nconsecutive activity bursts. We show how such inter-event correlations arise\nsimply because of a finite detection threshold, created by the limited\nsensitivity of the measurement apparatus, or used to subtract background\nactivity or noise from the activity signal. Data from crack propagation\nexperiments and numerical simulations of a non-equilibrium crack line model\ndemonstrate how thresholding leads to correlated bursts of activity by\nseparating the avalanche events into sub-avalanches. The resulting temporal\nsub-avalanche correlations are well-described by our general scaling\ndescription of thresholding-induced correlations in crackling noise.\n", "  Magnetic insulators, such as yttrium iron garnet (Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$), are\nideal materials for ultra-low power spintronics applications due to their low\nenergy dissipation and efficient spin current generation and transmission.\nRecently, it has been realized that spin dynamics can be driven very\neffectively in micrometer-sized Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$/Pt heterostructures by\nspin-Hall effects. We demonstrate here the excitation and detection of spin\ndynamics in Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$/Pt nanowires by spin-torque ferromagnetic\nresonance. The nanowires defined via electron-beam lithography are fabricated\nby conventional room temperature sputtering deposition on Gd$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12 }$\nsubstrates and lift-off. We observe field-like and anti-damping-like torques\nacting on the magnetization precession, which are due to simultaneous\nexcitation by Oersted fields and spin-Hall torques. The Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$/Pt\nnanowires are thoroughly examined over a wide frequency and power range. We\nobserve a large change in the resonance field at high microwave powers, which\nis attributed to a decreasing effective magnetization due to microwave\nabsorption. These heating effects are much more pronounced in the investigated\nnanostructures than in comparable micron-sized samples. By comparing different\nnanowire widths, the importance of geometrical confinements for magnetization\ndynamics becomes evident: quantized spin-wave modes across the width of the\nwires are observed in the spectra. Our results are the first stepping stones\ntoward the realization of integrated magnonic logic devices based on\ninsulators, where nanomagnets play an essential role.\n", "  We obtain two-dimensional exact analytic solutions for the structure of the\nhot accretion flows without wind. We assume that the only non-zero component of\nthe stress tensor is $T_{r\\varphi}$. Furthermore we assume that the value of\nviscosity coefficient $\\alpha$ varies with $\\theta$. We find radially\nself-similar solutions and compare them with the numerical and the analytical\nsolutions already studied in the literature. The no-wind solution obtained in\nthis paper may be applied to the nuclei of some cool-core clusters.\n", "  Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (MX2)/metal oxide\nheterostructures have shown unique physical properties, making them promising\nmaterials for various applications ranging from photocatalysis to solar energy\nconversion. Understanding the interfacial interactions is highly desirable for\ndesigning these heterostructures having excellent performance. Here we\nsystematically study the interfacial interaction in monolayer MX2 (M=Mo, W;\nX=S, Se)/CeO2 heterostructures and its effects on electronic and optical\nproperties by density functional theory. It is found that the interfacial\ninteraction in the MX2/CeO2 depends predominantly on the chalcogen (X) element.\nParticularly, the band gap variation and important electronic states at\nconduction band minimum or valence band maximum of the heterostructures are\ndetermined by the strength of interfacial interaction. The MX2/CeO2\nheterostructures with the same chalcogen (X) element have similar absorption\nspectra from ultraviolet to near-infrared regions. These results suggest that\nthe chalcogen (X) element is a key factor in tuning the properties of MX2/metal\noxide heterostructures.\n", "  In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) multiple-relaxation-time (MRT)\nlattice Boltzmann (LB) model is presented for convection heat transfer in\nporous media at the representative elementary volume (REV) scale. The model is\ndeveloped in the framework of the double-distribution-function (DDF) approach:\nan MRT-LB model of the density distribution function with the D3Q19 lattice (or\nD3Q15 lattice) is proposed to simulate the flow field based on the generalized\nnon-Darcy model, while an MRT-LB model of the temperature distribution function\nwith the D3Q7 lattice is proposed to simulate the temperature filed. The\npresent model is employed to simulate mixed convection flow in a porous channel\nand natural convection in a cubical porous cavity. The numerical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the present model in solving 3D\nconvection heat transfer problems in porous media. The numerical results also\ndemonstrate that the present model is approximately second-order accuracy in\nspace. In addition, an enthalpy-based DDF-MRT model for 3D solid-liquid phase\nchange with convection heat transfer in porous media is also presented.\n", "  The importance of Einstein's geometrization philosophy, as an alternative to\nthe least action principle, in constructing general relativity (GR), is\nilluminated. The role of differential identities in this philosophy is\nclarified. The use of Bianchi identity to write the field equations of GR is\nshown. Another similar identity in the absolute parallelism geometry is given.\nA more general differential identity in the parameterized absolute parallelism\ngeometry is derived. Comparison and interrelationships between the above\nmentioned identities and their role in constructing field theories are\ndiscussed.\n", "  In this paper we argue that the mechanism of unwinding inflation is naturally\npresent in warped compactifications of type IIB string theory with local\nthroats. The unwinding of flux is caused by its annihilation against branes.\nThe resulting inflaton potential is linear with periodic modulations. We\ninitiate an analysis of the inflationary dynamics and cosmological observables,\nwhich are highly constrained by moduli stabilization. For the simplified model\nof single-K\\\"ahler Calabi-Yau spaces we find that many, though not all of the\nconsistency constraints can be satisfied. Particularly, in this simple model\ngeometric constraints are in tension with obtaining the observed amplitude of\nthe scalar power spectrum. However, we do find 60 efolds of inflation with a\ntrans-Planckian field excursion which offers the hope that slightly more\ncomplicated models can lead to a fully consistent explicit construction of\nlarge field inflation of this kind.\n", "  Light cone with the speed of light independent of its wavelength in vacuum\nhas been known for long time. In the present work, we unveil that in a\nface-centered-cubic (fcc) lattice of dielectric spheres novel light cones can\nbe created over closed loops in momentum space, dubbed as nodal lines (NL), and\nthat as a consequence of the nontrivial topology of NL interface states with a\ndrumhead-shaped band structure appear where light can be slowed down\nsignificantly. We discuss that photonic pseudogaps found in previous\nexperimental and theoretical studies for fcc photonic crystals are consistent\nwith the present finding of NL. This offers a unique chance to confirm the\nexistence of NL as a novel topological state.\n", "  Within the framework of the Lanzhou quantum molecular dynamics (LQMD)\ntransport model, the nuclear fragmentation induced by low-energy antiprotons\nhas been investigated thoroughly. A coalescence approach is developed for\nconstructing the primary fragments in phase space. The secondary decay process\nof the fragments is described by the well-known statistical code. It is found\nthat the localized energy released in antibaryon-baryon annihilation is\ndeposited in a nucleus mainly via pion-nucleon collisions, which leads to the\nemissions of pre-equilibrium particles, fission, evaporation of nucleons and\nlight fragments etc. The strangeness exchange reactions dominate the hyperon\nproduction. The averaged mass loss increases with the mass number of target\nnucleus. A bump structure in the domain of intermediate mass for heavy targets\nappears owing to the contribution of fission fragments.\n", "  We reported a photon detection at the arrival time of the gravitational wave\non December 26th, 2015. According to the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, the\ngravitational wave was produced by the merging process of the two black holes.\nThe merged time was determined at 03:38:53.6 UT on December 26th. At\n03:38:54.05 GPS time, one of the detectors of SEDA-FIB on board the\nInternational Space Station (ISS) detected a photon, arriving from the\ndirection of Corona Australis near the Galactic Bulge (GB). The energy of the\nphoton was about (35+-7) MeV. A 3.0 sigma level detection of the photon is\ndiscussed.\n", "  Single molecule detection, sequencing and conformational mapping of aptamers\nare important for improving medical and biosensing technologies and for better\nunderstanding of biological processes at the molecular level. We obtain\nvibrational signals of single aptamers immobilized on gold substrates using\ntip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS). We compare topographic and optical\nsignals and investigate the fluctuations of the position-dependent TERS\nspectra. TERS mapping provides information about the chemical composition and\nconformation of aptamers, and paves the way to future single-molecule\nlabel-free sequencing.\n", "  We present a calculation of the form factors, $f_0$ and $f_+$, for the\n$B_{(s)} \\to D_{(s)}$ semileptonic decays. Our work uses the MILC $n_f=2+1$\nAsqTad configurations with NRQCD and HISQ valence quarks at four values of the\nmomentum transfer $q^2$. We provide results for the chiral-continuum\nextrapolations of the scalar and vector form factors.\n", "  This article present the double-periodical lattice made of infinite elastic\nfibers that withstand bending and tension. The model describes the elastic\nproperties of flat periodic structure. With this model the behavior of a\ntwo-dimensional array of infinite fibers is simulated. The material that\ncontains a row of broken fibers is considered. These broken fibers form the\nfailure in the material that shapes like a long straight crack. The lattice is\ntensioned in the direction, which is orthogonal to the direction of straight\ncrack. The conditions of fracture of this lattice are investigated. The closed\nform expression for the stress in the first unbroken fiber and the expression\nfor fracture toughness are given. These values are the functions of mechanical\nparameters of lattice and tensions in both families of fibers. The closed form\nsolution demonstrates a notable behavior of the material. Namely, the fracture\nbehavior of two-dimensional lattice is cardinally depends upon the pre-stress\nin the material in the direction, parallel to crack direction. If the tension\nin fibers that parallel to the crack direction exists, it stabilizes the crack\ngrowth and makes the load distribution in the unbroken fibers more even. The\ntwo-dimensional lattice behaves in the presence of tension in both directions\nsimilarly to the plane elastic media. The finite length crack assumes the shape\nof the elongated elliptic split. Another behavior of lattice occurs if the\nfibers, parallel to crack direction, are unstressed. The character of stress\nconcentration near the crack differs. The load distribution at the crack tip\nvaries considerably. The first unbroken fiber carries higher load. The crack is\nlens-shaped and the crack borders form at the tip the finite angle.\n", "  The unprecedented availability of large-scale human behavioral data is\nprofoundly changing the world we live in. Researchers, companies, governments,\nfinancial institutions, non-governmental organizations and also citizen groups\nare actively experimenting, innovating and adapting algorithmic decision-making\ntools to understand global patterns of human behavior and provide decision\nsupport to tackle problems of societal importance. In this chapter, we focus\nour attention on social good decision-making algorithms, that is algorithms\nstrongly influencing decision-making and resource optimization of public goods,\nsuch as public health, safety, access to finance and fair employment. Through\nan analysis of specific use cases and approaches, we highlight both the\npositive opportunities that are created through data-driven algorithmic\ndecision-making, and the potential negative consequences that practitioners\nshould be aware of and address in order to truly realize the potential of this\nemergent field. We elaborate on the need for these algorithms to provide\ntransparency and accountability, preserve privacy and be tested and evaluated\nin context, by means of living lab approaches involving citizens. Finally, we\nturn to the requirements which would make it possible to leverage the\npredictive power of data-driven human behavior analysis while ensuring\ntransparency, accountability, and civic participation.\n", "  The generation of single top production in the $Wt$ channel at NLO gives rise\nto doubly-resonant diagrams that overlap with $t \\bar t$, and similarly for\nassociated production with a $Z$ or Higgs boson. Several methods exist to\nremove this overlap, thus avoiding double counting and separating the two\nprocesses. In Diagram Removal 1, the amplitudes of doubly-resonant diagrams are\nset to zero, which also removes the interference of $Wt$ with $t \\bar t$. If a\nmeasurement is performed in a region where this interference is not negligible,\nit would be of interest to take it into account. Another method, Diagram\nSubtraction, preserves the interference. However, it relies upon momentum\nreshuffling, which introduces uncertainties to the prediction. An alternative\nmethod, Diagram Removal 2, does not involve reshuffling and preserves the\ninterference by subtracting the amplitude squared of the doubly-resonant\ndiagrams from the total. The predictions of Diagram Removal 2 from MG5_aMC@NLO\nare compared with other predictions for $Wt$ and $tWZ$ production in the\ncontext of analyses at the ATLAS experiment. Implications of using Diagram\nRemoval 2 are discussed, both for measurements of single top processes and when\n$Wt$ or $tWZ$ are treated as a background. Differential distributions are\nshown, investigating in what regions the predictions differ the most.\n", "  In present work we discuss the production of heavy quarkonia and diquarks in\n$pp$-interactions. The aim is to take into account the production of bound\nstates of quarks originating from independent parton scatterings. This\nproduction is regulated by constraints on the invariant mass of constituents.\nSuch an approach leads to larger value of the diquark production cross section\nthan traditional consideration in single parton scattering. This production\nmechanism of doubly heavy baryons can sooner be verified by modern experiments\n(e.g. LHCb). We also discuss related contributions to double and associated\nquarkonium production.\n", "  The Y-chromosome degeneration is still an intriguing mechanism and comprises\nthe very origin of sex. We present a coupled version of the well known logistic\nmap and the logistic equation describing the evolution of XY chromosomes.\nAlthough chaos was found in X, Y chromosomes do not evolve chaotically. A\nmathematical constraint is shown as the responsible for this behaviour. In\naddition, analytical solutions are presented for the differential equations\nherein.\n", "  The consequences of phase transitions in the early universe are becoming\ntestable in a variety of manners, from colliders physics to gravitational wave\nastronomy. In particular one phase transition we know of, the Electroweak Phase\nTransition (EWPT), could potentially be first order in BSM scenarios and\ntestable in the near future. If confirmed this could provide a mechanism for\nBaryogenesis, which is one of the most important outstanding questions in\nphysics. To reliably make predictions it is necessary to have full control of\nthe finite temperature scalar potentials. However, as we show the standard\nmethods used in BSM physics to improve phase transition calculations, resumming\nhard thermal loops, introduces significant errors into the scalar potential. In\naddition, the standard methods make it impossible to match theories to an EFT\ndescription reliably. In this paper we define a thermal resummation procedure\nbased on Partial Dressing (PD) for general BSM calculations of phase\ntransitions beyond the high-temperature approximation. Additionally, we\nintroduce the modified Optimized Partial Dressing (OPD) procedure, which is\nnumerically nearly as efficient as old incorrect methods, while yielding\nidentical results to the full PD calculation. This can be easily applied to\nfuture BSM studies of phase transitions in the early universe. As an example,\nwe show that in unmixed singlet scalar extensions of the SM, the (O)PD\ncalculations make new phenomenological predictions compared to previous\nanalyses. An important future application is the study of EFTs at finite\ntemperature.\n", "  Today it still remains a challenge whether quantum mechanics has an\nunderlying statistical explanation or not. While there are and were a lot of\nmodels trying to explain quantum phenomena with statistical methods these all\nfailed on certain levels. In this paper a method is proposed that is not only\nbased on a classical statistical framework but it has an underlying physical\nmodel behind it and it can explain some of the basic characteristics of quantum\nmechanics. It will be shown that if look at the properties of a charged\nparticle in a random electric field one can obtain the discrete energy values\nof the harmonic oscillator and the infinite potential well, and also gives a\ngood qualitative description of the double-slit experiment and measurement\ntheory. Also the side-effect of the model is the emergence of a constant with\nan action dimension.\n", "  Fractional nonlinear differential equations present an interplay between two\ncommon and important effective descriptions used to simplify high dimensional\nor more complicated theories: nonlinearity and fractional derivatives. These\neffective descriptions thus appear commonly in physical and mathematical\nmodeling. We present a new series method providing systematic controlled\naccuracy for solutions of fractional nonlinear differential equations. The\nmethod relies on spatially iterative use of power series expansions. Our\napproach permits an arbitrarily large radius of convergence and thus solves the\ntypical divergence problem endemic to power series approaches. We apply our\nmethod to the fractional nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation and its imaginary\ntime rotation, the fractional nonlinear diffusion equation. For the fractional\nnonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation we find fractional generalizations of cnoidal\nwaves of Jacobi elliptic functions as well as a fractional bright soliton. For\nthe fractional nonlinear diffusion equation we find the combination of\nfractional and nonlinear effects results in a more strongly localized solution\nwhich nevertheless still exhibits power law tails, albeit at a much lower\ndensity.\n", "  Kolmogorov's first axiom of probability is probability takes values between 0\nand 1; however, in Cox's derivation of probability having a maximum value of\nunity is arbitrary since he derives probability as a tool to rank degrees of\nplausibility. Probability can then be used to make inferences in instances of\nincomplete information, which is the foundation of Baysian probability theory.\nThis article formulates a rule, which if obeyed, allows probability to take\ncomplex values and still be consistent with the interpretation of probability\ntheory as being a tool to rank plausibility. It is then shown that Kirkwood\ndistributions and the conditional complex probability distributions proposed by\nHofmann do not obey this rule and therefore cannot rank plausibility. Not only\ndo these quasiprobability distributions relax Kolmogorov's first axiom of\nprobability, they also are void of the defining property of a probability\ndistribution from a Coxian and Baysian perspective - they lack the ability to\nrank plausibility.\n", "  We discuss a box model of migration in channels of networks with possible\napplication for modelling motion of migrants in migration networks. The channel\nconsists of nodes of the network (nodes may be considered as boxes representing\ncountries) and edges that connect these nodes and represent possible ways for\nmotion of migrants. The nodes of the migration channel have different\n\"leakage\", i.e. the probability of change of the status of a migrant (from\nmigrant to non-migrant) may be different in the different countries along the\nchannel. In addition the nodes far from the entry node of the channel may be\nmore attractive for migrants in comparison to the nodes around the entry node\nof the channel. We discuss below channels containing infinite number of nodes.\nTwo regimes of functioning of these channels are studied: stationary regime and\nnon-stationary regime. In the stationary regime of the functioning of the\nchannel the distribution of migrants in the countries of the channel is\ndescribed by a distribution that contains as particular case the Waring\ndistribution. In the non-stationary regime of functioning of the channel one\nobserves exponential increase or exponential decrease of the number of migrants\nin the countries of the channel. It depends on the situation in the entry\ncountry of the channel for which scenario will be realized. Despite the\nnon-stationary regime of the functioning of the channel the asymptotic\ndistribution of the migrants in the nodes of the channel is stationary. From\nthe point of view of the characteristic features of the migrants we discuss the\ncases of (i) migrants having the same characteristics and (ii) two classes of\nmigrants that have differences in some characteristic (e.g., different\nreligions).\n", "  We introduce a simple two-level heat engine to study the efficiency in the\ncondition of the maximum power output, depending on the energy levels from\nwhich the net work is extracted. In contrast to the quasi-statically operated\nCarnot engine whose efficiency reaches the theoretical maximum, recent research\non more realistic engines operated in finite time has revealed other classes of\nefficiency such as the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency maximizing the power output.\nWe investigate yet another side with our heat engine model, which consists of\npure relaxation and net work extraction processes from the population\ndifference caused by different transition rates. Due to the nature of our\nmodel, the time-dependent part is completely decoupled from the other terms in\nthe generated work. We derive analytically the optimal condition for transition\nrates maximizing the generated power output and discuss its implication on\ngeneral premise of realistic heat engines. In particular, the optimal engine\nefficiency of our model is different from the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency,\nalthough they share the universal linear and quadratic coefficients at the\nnear-equilibrium limit. We further confirm our results by taking an alternative\napproach in terms of the entropy production at hot and cold reservoirs.\n", "  The manipulation of visible light is important in science and technology\nresearch. Metasurfaces can enable flexible and effective regulation of the\nphase, polarization, and propagation modes of an electromagnetic wave.\nMetasurfaces have become a research hotspot in optics and electromagnetics, and\ncross-polarization conversion is an important application for visible-light\nmanipulation using a metasurface. A metasurface composed of nano-antenna arrays\nand bilayer plasma can reportedly convert the direction of linear polarized\nlight efficiently. However, the metasurface of cross-polarization conversion\noperating in short-wavelength visible light is problematic. In addition,\nprevious metasurfaces prepared using the top-down etching method is unsuitable\nfor practical applications because of the necessary harsh experimental\nconditions and the high construction cost of preparation. In the present work,\nwe suggest a dendritic cell-cluster metasurface achieve cross-polarization in\ntransmission mode within 550, 570, 590 and 610 nm wavelength. Preparation is\naccomplished using a bottom-up electrochemical deposition method, which is easy\nand low cost. The dendritic cell-cluster metasurface is an important step in\ncross-polarization conversion research and has broad application prospects and\ndevelopment potential.\n", "  We study a nonlocal AB-KdV system obtained directly from the KdV equation to\ndescribe two-area physical event. The exact solutions of the AB-KdV system,\nincluding $P_s T_d$ invariant and $P_s T_d$ symmetric breaking solutions are\nshown by different methods. These solutions, such as single soliton solutions,\ninfinitely many singular soliton solutions, cnoidal wave solutions, and\nsymmetry reduction solutions etc., show the AB-KdV system possesses rich\nstructures. Also, a special B\\\"{a}cklund transformation related to residual\nsymmetry is presented via the localization of the residual symmetry to find\ninteractive solutions between the solitons and other types of the AB-KdV\nsystem.\n", "  In a previous work we showed that spin can be envisioned as living in a phase\nspace that is dual to the standard phase space of position and momentum. In\nthis work we demonstrate that the second class constraints inherent in this\n\"Dual Phase Space\" picture can be solved by introducing a spinorial\nparameterization of the spinning degrees of freedom. This allows for a purely\nfirst class formulation that generalizes the usual relativistic description of\nspinless particles and provides several insights into the nature of spin and\nits relationship with spacetime and locality. In particular, we find that the\nspin motion acts as a Lorentz contraction on the four-velocity and that, in\naddition to proper time, spinning particles posses a second gauge invariant\nobservable which we call proper angle. Heuristically, this proper angle\nrepresents the amount of Zitterbewegung necessary for a spin transition to\noccur. Additionally, we show that the spin velocity satisfies a causality\nconstraint, and even more stringently, that it is constant along classical\ntrajectories. This leads to the notion of \"half-quantum\" states which violate\nthe classical equations of motion, and yet do not experience an exponential\nsuppression in the path integral. Finally we give a full analysis of the\nPoisson bracket structure of this new parametrization.\n", "  The radical pair (RP) mechanism, which describes the quantum dynamics of a\nspatially separated electron pair, is considered as one of the principal models\nof avian magnetoreception. Different from the conventional phenomenological\napproach where the sensitivity of avian magnetoreception is characterized by\nthe singlet yield $\\Phi_{S}$, we introduce the quantum Fisher information\n(QFI), which represents the maximum information about the magnetic field's\ndirection extracted from the RP state, to give a precise measure of sensitivity\nof avian compass essentially. The consistency between our results and\nexperimental observations suggests that QFI plays a decisive role in avian\nmagnetoreception. Besides, within the framework of quantum metrology, we can\njudge the feasibility of any possible measurement scheme for avian\nmagnetoreception, and shed light on an intrinsic relevance between the singlet\nyield and a concrete measurement scheme of our approach. The present work\nallows us to understand many things about avian magnetoreception from a fully\nnew perspective of quantum metrology, and provide a new route to establish a\ndirect connection between quantum information and many other biological\nfunctions.\n", "  The s manifold energy levels for phosphorus donors in silicon are important\ninput parameters for the design and modelling of electronic devices on the\nnanoscale. In this paper we calculate these energy levels from first principles\nusing density functional theory. The wavefunction of the donor electron's\nground state is found to have a form that is similar to an atomic s orbital,\nwith an effective Bohr radius of 1.8 nm. The corresponding binding energy of\nthis state is found to be 41 meV, which is in good agreement with the currently\naccepted value of 45.59 meV. We also calculate the energies of the excited\n1s(T) and 1s(E) states, finding them to be 32 and 31 meV respectively. These\nresults constitute the first ab initio confirmation of the s manifold energy\nlevels for phosphorus donors in silicon.\n", "  The geometric measure of entanglement $E$ of an $m$ qubit quantum state takes\nmaximal possible value $m$. In previous work of Gross, Flammia, and Eisert, it\nwas shown that $E \\ge m-O(\\log m)$ with high probability as $m\\to\\infty$. They\nshowed, as a consequence, that the vast majority of states are too entangled to\nbe computationally useful. In this paper, we show that for $m$ qubit {\\em\nBoson} quantum states (those that are actually available in current designs for\nquantum computers), the maximal possible geometric measure of entanglement is\n$\\log_2 m$, opening the door to many computationally universal states. We\nfurther show the corresponding concentration result that $E \\ge \\log_2 m -\nO(\\log \\log m)$ with high probability as $m\\to\\infty$. We extend these results\nalso to $m$-mode $n$-bit Boson quantum states.\n", "  We call Krawtchouk-Griffiths systems, KG-systems, systems of multivariate\npolynomials orthogonal with respect to corresponding multinomial distributions.\nThe original Krawtchouk polynomials are orthogonal with respect to a binomial\ndistribution. Here we present a Fock space construction with raising and\nlowering operators. The operators of \"multiplication by X\" are found in terms\nof boson operators and corresponding recurrence relations presented. The\nRiccati partial differential equations for the differentiation operators,\nBerezin transform and associated partial differential equations are found.\nThese features provide the specifications for a Bernoulli system as a\nquantization formulation of multivariate Krawtchouk polynomials.\n", "  We present a careful statistical analysis of pulsating aurora (PA) using\nall-sky green line (557.7 nm) images obtained at 3.3 Hz. Six well-defined\nindividual PA patches are identified and extracted using a contouring\ntechnique. Quantitative parameters such as the patch duration (on-time and\noff-time), peak intensity, and integrated intensity are determined for each\npatch and each pulsation. The resulting characteristics serve as strict\nobservational constraints that any of the many competing theories attempting to\nexplain PA must predict. The purpose of this paper is to determine the\ncharacteristics of PA patches in order to provide better observational\nconstraints on the suggested mechanisms. All aspects of the temporal behavior\nof the individual patches appear to be erratic. Historically, PA has been\ndefined very loosely and we argue that the use of the term \"pulsating\" is\ninappropriate since our findings and other published results are not regularly\nperiodic and thus a more appropriate term may be fluctuating aurora. Further,\nwe find that the observational constraints do not fit well with the flow\ncyclotron maser theory, which in particular is suggested to create PA patches.\nThere is no clear candidate of the suggested mechanisms and drivers to explain\nthe observational constraints set by the PA patches in a satisfactory manner.\n", "  In many interesting systems, the fermion determinant becomes complex and its\nphase plays a crucial role in the determination of the vacuum. For instance, in\nfinite density QCD at low temperature and high density, exotic fermion\ncondensates are conjectured to form due to such effects. When one applies the\ncomplex Langevin method to such a complex action system naively, one cannot\nobtain the correct results because of the singular-drift problem associated\nwith the appearance of small eigenvalues of the Dirac operator. Here we propose\nto avoid this problem by adding a fermion bilinear term to the action and\nextrapolating its coefficient to zero. We test this idea in an SO(4)-invariant\nmatrix model with a Gaussian action and a complex fermion determinant, whose\nphase is expected to induce the spontaneous breaking of the SO(4) symmetry. Our\nresults agree well with the previous results obtained by the Gaussian expansion\nmethod.\n", "  The electromagnetic wave propagation velocity at low radio frequencies is an\nimportant input parameter for lightning location systems that use time of\narrival (TOA) method. This velocity is normally fixed at or near the speed of\nlight. However, this study finds that the radio waves from two submarine\ncommunication transmitters at 20.9 kHz and 23.4 kHz exhibit phase propagation\nvelocities that are $\\sim$0.51% slower and $\\sim$0.64% faster than the speed of\nlight as a result of sky wave contributions and ground effects. Therefore, a\nnovel technique with a variable phase propagation velocity is implemented for\nthe first time in the TOA method and applied to electric field recordings with\na long-baseline lightning location system that consists of four radio receivers\nin western Europe. The lightning locations inferred from variable velocities\nimprove the accuracy of locations inferred from a fixed velocity by\n$\\sim$0.89-1.06 km when compared to the lightning locations reported by the UK\nMetOffice. The normal distributions of the observed phase propagation\nvelocities in small geographic areas are not centered at the speed of light.\nConsequently, representative velocities can be calculated for many small\ngeographic areas to produce a velocity map over central France where numerous\nlightning discharges occurred. This map reflects the impact of sky waves and\nground effects on the calculation of lightning locations as a result of the\nnetwork configuration. It is concluded that the use of variable phase\npropagation velocities mitigates the influence of sky waves and ground effects\nin long-range lightning location networks.\n", "  We report on the development of new 3D pixel sensors for the Phase 2 Upgrades\nat the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). To cope with the requirements of increased\npixel granularity (e.g., 50x50 or 25x100 um2 pixel size) and extreme radiation\nhardness (up to a fluence of 2e16 neq cm-2), thinner 3D sensors (~100 um) with\nelectrodes having narrower size (~ 5 um) and reduced spacing (~ 30 um) are\nconsidered. The paper covers TCAD simulations, as well as technological and\ndesign aspects relevant to the first batch of these 3D sensors, that is\ncurrently being fabricated at FBK on 6-inch wafers.\n", "  We study the O(3) sigma model in $D=2$ on the lattice with a Boltzmann weight\nlinearized in $\\beta$ on each link. While the spin formulation now suffers from\na sign-problem the equivalent loop model remains positive and becomes\nparticularly simple. By studying the transfer matrix and by performing Monte\nCarlo simulations in the loop form we study the mass gap coupling in a step\nscaling analysis. The question addressed is, whether or not such a simplified\naction still has the right universal continuum limit. If the answer is\naffirmative this would be helpful in widening the applicability of worm\nalgorithm methods.\n", "  This paper covers the main technological and design aspects relevant to the\ndevelopment of a new generation of thin 3D pixel sensors with small pixel size\naimed at the High-Luminosity LHC upgrades.\n", "  We report on the 3-year INFN ATLAS-CMS joint research activity in\ncollaboration with FBK, started in 2014, and aimed at the development of new\nthin pixel detectors for the High Luminosity LHC Phase-2 upgrades. The program\nis concerned with both 3D and planar active-edge pixel sensors to be made on\n6-inch p-type wafers. The technology and the design will be optimized and\nqualified for extreme radiation hardness (2e16 neq cm-2). Pixel layouts\ncompatible with present (for testing) and future (RD53 65nm) front-end chips of\nATLAS and CMS are considered. The paper covers the main aspects of the research\nprogram, from the sensor design and fabrication technology, to the results of\ninitial tests performed on the first prototypes.\n", "  We propose a method of producing steady-state coherent light with negative\nWigner functions in nonlinear media combined with feedback control. While the\nnonlinearities are essential to produce the Wigner negativities, this alone is\ninsufficient to stabilize steady-state light with negativities. Using feedback\ncontrol to control the phase in the cavity, we find that this produces\nsignificant total negativities for reasonable experimental parameters. The\nnegative Wigner function is produced continuously and does not appear to be\nrestricted to low-amplitude light. The technique is applicable to systems such\nas exciton-polaritons, where strong natural nonlinearities are present.\n", "  A major hurdle to the deployment of quantum linear systems algorithms and\nrecent quantum simulation algorithms lies in the difficulty to find inexpensive\nreversible circuits for arithmetic using existing hand coded methods. Motivated\nby recent advances in reversible logic synthesis, we synthesize arithmetic\ncircuits using classical design automation flows and tools. The combination of\nclassical and reversible logic synthesis enables the automatic design of large\ncomponents in reversible logic starting from well-known hardware description\nlanguages such as Verilog. As a prototype example for our approach we\nautomatically generate high quality networks for the reciprocal $1/x$, which is\nnecessary for quantum linear systems algorithms.\n", "  We consider the effects in the production via gluon fusion in LHC collisions\nof one or two spin-zero new resonant particles $\\Phi$ that decay into a top\nquark pair. We revisit previous analyses of the interferences between the\nheavy-fermion loop-induced $gg \\rightarrow \\Phi \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$ signal\nand the continuum QCD background $gg \\rightarrow t\\bar{t}$. We show that in the\npresence of standard model fermions only in the $gg \\rightarrow \\Phi$ loops,\nthe interference effect is destructive causing a dip in the $t \\bar t$ mass\ndistribution. Including New Physics such as additional vector-like quarks leads\nto a totally different picture as the line-shape can be distorted by peaks and\ndips. For the time being, the absence of such effects in ATLAS and CMS data\nconstrain models of the production and decays of the $\\Phi$ state(s).\n", "  We study under which conditions systems of coupled oscillators on complex\nnetworks display remote synchronization, a situation where pairs of vertices,\nnot necessarily physically linked, but with the same network symmetry, are\nsynchronized.\n", "  In the present work, we study the structures and molecular geometries of\n$CH_{4}$, $SO_{2}$ and $O_{2}$ adsorbed on $Cr_{2}O_{3}(0001)$. Using\ncomputational calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT), we\nanalyze the most suitable sites to carry out the adsorption of each of the\nmolecules mentioned, and the influence of each species on the adsorption and\ndissociation of the others. The results allow us to understand the activation\nof the $Cr_{2}O_{3}(0001)$ surface, which leads to the presence of $SO_{2}$\nduring the oxidation of $CH_{4}$, as was experimentally verified.\n", "  In this article, we study top quark pair charge, energy and incline asymmetry\nat parton level using Powheg Monte-Carlo generator.\n", "  Even though quantum mechanics has existed for almost 100 years, questions\nconcerning the foundation and interpretation of the theory still remain. These\nissues have gathered more attention in recent years, but does this mean that\nphysicists are more aware of foundational issues concerning quantum mechanics?\nA survey was sent out to 1234 physicists affiliated to 8 different\nuniversities. 149 responded to the questions, which both concerned foundational\nissues related to quantum mechanics, specifically, as well as questions\nconcerning interpretations of physical theories in general. The answers to the\nsurvey revealed that foundational concepts in quantum mechanics are still a\ntopic that only a minority of physicists are familiar with, although a clear\nmajority of physicists find that interpretations of physical theories are\nimportant. The various questions, as well as how the respondents answered, are\npresented. The survey intends to give an overview of what the opinion of the\nphysics community, in general, is concerning issues related to quantum\nmechanics.\n", "  Insertion of layers displaying field-induced metal-to-insulator (M/I)\ntransition in ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) has received attention as a\npotentially useful way to enlarge junction tunnel electroresistance (TER).\nHalf-doped manganites being at the verge of metal-insulator character are thus\ngood candidates to be slave layers in FTJs. However, the phase diagram of these\noxides is extremely sensitive to strain and thus can be radically different\nwhen integrated in epitaxial FTJs. Here we report a systematic study of\nlarge-area (A = 4 to 100 um2) Pt/La0.5Sr0.5MnO3/BaTiO3/La0.7Sr0.3MnO3\n(Pt/HD/BTO/LSMO) FTJs, having different thicknesses of the ferroelectric\n(2-3nm) and HD layers (1-2nm), grown on substrates imposing either tensile\n(SrTiO3) or compressive (LaAlO3) strains. Room-temperature electric\ncharacterization of the FTJs shows polarization-controlled ON/ OFF states.\nClear evidences of field-induced M/I transition (difference between junction\nresistance in OFF and ON state is increased of more than one order of\nmagnitude) are observed in junctions prepared on SrTiO3 but the HD layer is\ngenerally metallic on LaAlO3. Moreover, the M/I transition is only confined in\nan interfacial layer of the slave film thus entailing an overall reduction of\nTER. The orderly results reported here give some hints towards selection of HD\nmaterials and substrates for optimal FTJ responsiveness.\n", "  This paper deals with the critical issue of approximating the pre-exponential\nfactor in semiclassical molecular dynamics. The pre-exponential factor is\nimportant because it accounts for the quantum contribution to the semiclassical\npropagator of the classical Feynman path fluctuations. Pre-exponential factor\napproximations are necessary when chaotic or complex systems are simulated. We\nintroduced pre-exponential factor approximations based either on analytical\nconsiderations or numerical regularization. The approximations are tested for\npower spectrum calculations of more and more chaotic model systems and on\nseveral molecules, for which exact quantum mechanical values are available. The\nresults show that the pre-exponential factor approximations introduced are\naccurate enough to be safely employed for semiclassical simulations of complex\nsystems.\n", "  The conjectured magnetized Kerr/CFT correspondence states that the quantum\ntheory of gravity in the near horizon of extreme Kerr black holes immersed by\nthe magnetic field, Near Horizon Extreme Magnetized Kerr black holes, is\nholographic dual to a two-dimensional chiral conformal field theory. To obtain\nNear Horizon Extreme Magnetized Kerr geometry, the extreme limit of the\nmagnetized Kerr metric is taken so, $ a=M $ and then continued by transforming\nthe coordinates to have a warped and twisted product of $ \\textrm{AdS}_2 \\times\n\\textrm{S}^2 $, and also with the Near Horizon Extreme Kerr metric one.\nConsequently, we can obtain also the new Ernst potentials for those geometries.\nFinally, the transformed central charge from the extremal non-magnetized one to\nthe magnetized one in the Ernst-Papapetrou formalism is obtained.\n", "  While various structural and dynamical precursors to vitrification have been\nidentified, a predictive and quantitative description of how subtle changes at\nthe microscopic scale give rise to the steep growth in macroscopic viscosity is\nmissing. It was proposed that the presence of long-lived bonded structures\nwithin the liquid may provide this connection. Here we directly observe and\nquantify the connectivity dynamics in liquids of charged colloids en-route to\nvitrification. Based on these data, we extend Dyre's elastic model for the\nglass transition to account for particle-level dynamics; this results in a\nparameter-free expression for the slowing down of relaxations in the liquid\nthat is in quantitative agreement with our experiments.\n", "  Mid-infrared bright objects in the direction of the Galactic Bulge were\ninvestigated using time series photometry from the MACHO data archive, which\nled to the discovery of a large number of long-period variables. Among these, a\ntotal of 192 bona-fide Mira variables was identified, which, to the best of our\nknowledge, are reported here for the first time. Together with the results from\nour previous investigations, we thereby bring the number of Mira variables\nfound in the MACHO Galactic Bulge fields to a new total of 1286 stars. Light\ncurves, folded light curves and summary data for all new Mira variables are\npresented and their properties in colour-colour, period-colour and\nperiod-magnitude space are investigated. In agreement with our expectations,\nthe present sample of mid-infrared bright objects is composed mostly of\nluminous, long-period variables.\n", "  As photon mixing is not inherently limited to any specific spectral region,\nparametric processes represent a compelling solution for all-optical signal\nprocessing in spectral windows not easily accessible by other technologies.\nParticularly, the continuous-wave pumping scheme is essential for any\napplication requiring modulated signals or precise spectroscopic\ncharacterization. Highly nonlinear fibers enabled record performances for\nwavelength conversion and amplification in the telecommunication band, however\nno waveguiding platforms have yet solved the trade-off between\nhigh-nonlinearity, low propagation losses and dispersion in the mid-infrared.\nHere, we show mid-infrared continuous-wave parametric amplification in a GeAsSe\nfiber. Leveraging state-of-the-art fabrication techniques, a novel tapered\nphotonic crystal fiber geometry enabling 4.5 dB signal amplification and 2 dB\nidler conversion efficiency is experimentally demonstrated using only 125 mW of\npump in the 2 micron wavelength range. This result is not only the first ever\ncontinuous-wave parametric amplification measured at 2 micron, in any\nwaveguide, but also establishes GeAsSe PCF tapers as the most promising\nall-fibered, high efficiency continuous-wave parametric converter for advanced\napplications in the mid-infrared.\n", "  One of the main goals of the feasibility study MOSE (MOdellig ESO Sites) is\nto evaluate the performances of a method conceived to forecast the optical\nturbulence above the ESO sites of the Very Large Telescope and the\nEuropean-Extremely Large Telescope in Chile. The method implied the use of a\ndedicated code conceived for the optical turbulence (OT) called Astro-Meso-Nh.\nIn this paper we present results we obtained at conclusion of this project\nconcerning the performances of this method in forecasting the most relevant\nparameters related to the optical turbulence (CN2, seeing , isoplanatic angle\ntheta_0 and wavefront coherence time tau_0). Numerical predictions related to a\nvery rich statistical sample of nights uniformly distributed along a solar year\nand belonging to different years have been compared to observations and\ndifferent statistical operators have been analyzed such as classical bias, RMSE\nand and more sophisticated statistical operators derived by the contingency\ntables that are able to quantify the score of success of a predictive method\nsuch as the percentage of correct detection (PC) and the probability to detect\na parameter within a specific range of values (POD). The main conclusions of\nthe study tell us that the Astro-Meso-Nh model provides performances that are\nalready very good to definitely guarantee a not negligible positive impact on\nthe Service Mode of top-class telescopes and ELTs. A demonstrator for an\nautomatic and operational version of the Astro-Meso-Nh model will be soon\nimplemented on the sites of VLT and E-ELT.\n", "  Raman spectroscopy has been widely applied to the chemical analysis of food\nquality and, in particular, of chocolate. We perform Raman analysis of bloom\nformation in white and dark chocolates. We show evidence of sugar and fat bloom\nand investigate spectroscopic signatures of polymorphic changes in different\nphases.\n", "  Comment on ``Wigner phase space description of a Morse oscillator''\n", "  We calculate on-shell scattering amplitudes involving fermions at the tree\nlevel in open superstring field theory. We confirm that four-point and\nfive-point amplitudes in the world-sheet path integral with the standard\nprescription using picture-changing operators are reproduced. For the\nfour-point amplitudes, we find that the quartic interaction required by gauge\ninvariance adjusts the different assignment of picture-changing operators in\nthe $s$-channel and in the $t$-channel of Feynman diagrams with two cubic\nvertices. For the five-point amplitudes, the correct amplitudes are reproduced\nin a more intricate way via the quartic and quintic interactions. Our\ncalculations can be interpreted as those for a complete action with a\nconstraint on the Ramond sector or as those for the covariant formulation\ndeveloped by Sen with spurious free fields.\n", "  High-temperature indium flux growth was applied to prepare single crystals of\nGdRh$_2$Si$_2$ by a modified Bridgman method leading to mm-sized single\ncrystals with a platelet habitus. Specific heat and susceptibility data of\nGdRh$_2$Si$_2$ exhibit a pronounced anomaly at $T_N = 107\\rm \\,K$, where the\nAFM ordering sets in. Magnetic measurements on the single crystals were\nperformed down to $T = 2$\\,K in external fields from B = 0 - 9\\,T applied along\nthe $[100]$-, $[110]$- and $[001]$-direction of the tetragonal lattice. The\neffective magnetic moment determined from a Curie-Weiss fit agrees well with\nvalues from literature, and is larger than the theoretically predicted value.\nElectrical transport data recorded for current flow parallel and perpendicular\nto the $[001]$-direction show a large anisotropy below $T_N$. The residual\nresistivity ratio $\\rm RRR=\\rho_{300K}/\\rho_{0}\\sim 23$ demonstrates that we\nsucceeded in preparing high-quality crystals using high-temperature indium\nflux-growth.\n", "  A new method for generating variance reduction parameters for strongly\nanisotropic, deep-penetration radiation shielding studies is presented. This\nmethod generates an alternate form of the adjoint scalar flux quantity,\n$\\phi^{\\dagger}_{\\Omega}$, which is used by both CADIS and FW-CADIS to generate\nvariance reduction parameters for local and global response functions,\nrespectively. The new method, called CADIS-$\\Omega$, was implemented in the\nDenovo/ADVANTG software suite, and results are presented for a concrete\nlabyrinth test problem. Results indicate that the flux generated by\nCADIS-$\\Omega$ incorporates localized angular anisotropies in the flux\neffectively. CADIS-$\\Omega$ outperformed CADIS in the test problem while\nobtaining accurate results. This initial work indicates that CADIS-$\\Omega$ may\nbe highly useful for shielding problems with strong angular anisotropies. A\nfuture test plan to fully characterize the new method is proposed, which should\nreveal more about the types of realistic problems for which the CADIS-$\\Omega$\nwill be suited.\n", "  We systematically analyze the operator content of unitary superconformal\nmultiplets in $d > 3$ spacetime dimensions. We present a simple, general, and\nefficient algorithm that generates all of these multiplets by correctly\neliminating possible null states. The algorithm is conjectural, but passes a\nvast web of consistency checks. We apply it to tabulate a large variety of\nsuperconformal multiplets. In particular, we classify and construct all\nmultiplets that contain conserved currents or free fields, which play an\nimportant role in superconformal field theories (SCFTs). Some currents that are\nallowed in conformal field theories cannot be embedded in superconformal\nmultiplets, and hence they are absent in SCFTs. We use the structure of\nsuperconformal stress tensor multiplets to show that SCFTs with more than 16\nPoincar\\'e supercharges cannot arise in $d \\geq 4$, even when the corresponding\nsuperconformal algebras exist. We also show that such theories do arise in $d =\n3$, but are necessarily free.\n", "  We give predictions for the branching ratios of several rare radiative\nB-decays which proceed only through weak annihilation mechanism. In addition to\nprevious analysis we estimate the branching ratios of $\\bar{B}^0_s\\to\nD^{*0}\\gamma$ and $B_c^-\\to\\rho^-\\gamma$ decays and obtain $2.87\\cdot 10^{-9}$\nand $2.59\\cdot 10^{-7}$ for them correspondingly. The accuracy of the\npredictions is at the level of 20\\%.\n", "  M40 has always been something of an oddity in the Messier Catalogue, since it\nis just a pair of stars rather than an extended object. Doubts have also been\nexpressed as to whether it is even a physical binary. Here, we note that the\nHipparcos/Gaia parallaxes for these two stars remove all doubt: Messier 40\ncomprises a pair of entirely unrelated stars.\n"]}
