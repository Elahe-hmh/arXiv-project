While neutrino is related to electro-weak field, the fourth\nstable elementary particle delta is related to gravitation-\"strong\" field, and\nsome new meta-stable baryons may appear near the TeV region. Therefore, a\ntwofold standard model diagram is proposed, and involves some experiment\nphenomena: The new meta-stable baryons' decays produce delta particles, which\nare helpful in explaining the Dijet asymmetry phenomena at LHC of CERN, the\ndifferent results for the Fermilab's data peak, etc; However, according to the\n(B-L) invariance, the sterile \"neutrino\" about the event excess in MiniBooNe is\nnot the fourth neutrino but rather the delta particle; We think that the delta\nparticles are related to the phenomenon about neutrinos FTL, and that\nanti-neutrinos are faster than neutrinos. FTL is also related to cosmic\ninflation, singular point disappearance, a finite universe, and abnormal red\nshift of SN Ia. Besides, the dark matter particles with low mass are helpful in\nexplaining missing solar neutrinos, the CMB angular power spectrum measured by\nWMAP etc. Some experiments and observations are suggested, especially about the\nmeasurement for the speed of gravitational wave c'. c' and c, in physics,\nrepresent the limit speeds of moving particles made by different categories of\nmatter with different Lorentz factors. Lorentz transformation is compatible\nwith FTL. This will be helpful to look for new particles.\n", "  We have developed a phenomenological approach which describes very well the\npi0, eta and eta-prime meson production in the two-photon interactions. The\nsimultaneous description of the pi0, eta and eta-prime meson two-photon form\nfactors is consistent with data in the space-like region. The obtained form\nfactors are implemented in the event generator EKHARA and the simulated cross\nsections are presented. Uncertainties in the measured form factors coming from\nthe model dependence in Monte Carlo simulations are studied. The model\npredictions for the form factor slopes at the origin are given and the high-Q2\nlimit is also discussed.\n", "  The first $0^+$ resonant state of the $^{12}$C nucleus ${}^{12}$C$(0_2^+)$,\nso called the Hoyle state, is investigated in a three-$\\alpha$-particle\n(3-$\\alpha$) model. A wave function for the photodisintegration reaction of a\n$^{12}$C bound state to 3-$\\alpha$ final states is defined and calculated by\nthe Faddeev three-body formalism, in which three-body bound- and continuum\nstates are treated consistently. From the wave function at the Hoyle state\nenergy, I calculated distributions of outgoing $\\alpha$-particles and density\ndistributions at interior region of the Hoyle state. Results show that a\nprocess through a two-$\\alpha$ resonant state is dominant in the decay and\ncontributions of the rest process are very small, less than 1 \\%. There appear\nsome peaks in the interior density distribution corresponding to configurations\nof an equilateral- and an isosceles triangles. It turns out that these results\nare obtained independently of the choice of $\\alpha$-particle interaction\nmodels, when they are made to reproduce the Hoyle state energy.\n", "  Tungsten ditelluride (WTe2), a layered transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD),\nhas recently demonstrated an extremely large magnetoresistance effect, which is\nunique among TMDs. This fascinating feature seems to be correlated with its\nspecial electronic structure. Here, we report the observation of 6 Raman peaks\ncorresponding to the A_2^4, A_1^9, A_1^8, A_1^6, A_1^5 and A_1^2 phonons, from\nthe 33 Raman-active modes predicted for WTe2. This provides direct evidence to\ndistinguish the space group of WTe2 from that of other TMDs. Moreover, the\nRaman evolution of WTe2 from bulk to monolayer is clearly revealed. It is\ninteresting to find that the A_2^4 mode, centered at ~109.8 cm-1, is forbidden\nin a monolayer, which may be attributable to the transition of the point group\nfrom C2v (bulk) to C2h (monolayer). Our work characterizes all observed Raman\npeaks in the bulk and few-layer samples and provides a route to study the\nphysical properties of two-dimensional WTe2.\n", "  We study the onset of the reheating epoch at the end of axion-driven\ninflation where the axion is coupled to an Abelian, $U(1)$, gauge field via a\nChern-Simons interaction term. We focus primarily on $m^2\\phi^2$ inflation and\nexplore the possibility that preheating can occur for a range of coupling\nvalues consistent with recent observations and bounds on the overproduction of\nprimordial black holes. We find that for a wide range of parameters preheating\nis efficient. In certain cases the inflaton is seen to transfer all its energy\nto the gauge fields within a few oscillations. In most cases, we find that the\ngauge fields on sub-horizon scales end preheating in an unpolarized state due\nto the existence of strong rescattering between the inflaton and gauge-field\nmodes. We also present a preliminary study of an axion monodromy model coupled\nto $U(1)$ gauge fields, seeing a similarly efficient preheating behavior as\nwell as indications that the coupling strength has an effect on the creation of\noscillons.\n", "  We study derivatively coupled fermions in axion-driven inflation,\nspecifically $m_\\phi^2\\phi^2$ and monodromy inflation, and calculate particle\nproduction during the inflationary epoch and the post-inflationary axion\noscillations. During inflation, the rolling axion acts as an effective chemical\npotential for helicity which biases the gravitational production of one fermion\nhelicity over the other. This mechanism allows for efficient gravitational\nproduction of heavy fermion states that would otherwise be highly suppressed.\nFollowing inflation, the axion oscillates and fermions with both helicities are\nproduced as the effective frequency of the fermion field changes\nnon-adiabatically. For certain values of the fermion mass and axion-fermion\ncoupling strength, the two helicity states are produced asymmetrically,\nresulting in unequal number-densities of left- and right-helicity fermions.\n", "  Path-dependent stochastic processes are often non-ergodic and observables can\nno longer be computed within the ensemble picture. The resulting mathematical\ndifficulties pose severe limits to the analytical understanding of\npath-dependent processes. Their statistics is typically non-multinomial in the\nsense that the multiplicities of the occurrence of states is not a multinomial\nfactor. The maximum entropy principle is tightly related to multinomial\nprocesses, non-interacting systems, and to the ensemble picture; It loses its\nmeaning for path-dependent processes. Here we show that an equivalent to the\nensemble picture exists for path-dependent processes, such that the\nnon-multinomial statistics of the underlying dynamical process, by\nconstruction, is captured correctly in a functional that plays the role of a\nrelative entropy. We demonstrate this for self-reinforcing P\\'olya urn\nprocesses, which explicitly generalise multinomial statistics. We demonstrate\nthe adequacy of this constructive approach towards non-multinomial pendants of\nentropy by computing frequency and rank distributions of P\\'olya urn processes.\nWe show how microscopic update rules of a path-dependent process allow us to\nexplicitly construct a non-multinomial entropy functional, that, when\nmaximized, predicts the time-dependent distribution function.\n", "  The correlated motion of flocks is an instance of global order emerging from\nlocal interactions. An essential difference with analogous ferromagnetic\nsystems is that flocks are active: animals move relative to each other,\ndynamically rearranging their interaction network. The effect of this\noff-equilibrium element is well studied theoretically, but its impact on actual\nbiological groups deserves more experimental attention. Here, we introduce a\nnovel dynamical inference technique, based on the principle of maximum entropy,\nwhich accodomates network rearrangements and overcomes the problem of slow\nexperimental sampling rates. We use this method to infer the strength and range\nof alignment forces from data of starling flocks. We find that local bird\nalignment happens on a much faster timescale than neighbour rearrangement.\nAccordingly, equilibrium inference, which assumes a fixed interaction network,\ngives results consistent with dynamical inference. We conclude that bird\norientations are in a state of local quasi-equilibrium over the interaction\nlength scale, providing firm ground for the applicability of statistical\nphysics in certain active systems.\n", "  Explicit expressions for pion correlators are derived in position-space,\nemploying Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT). Resonance exchange contributions\nare included to test the range of applicability of the leading-order ChPT\nexpressions. The obtained results will be useful for a forthcoming Lattice-QCD\nstudy of double parton distributions in the pion.\n", "  We investigate a possibility for explaining the recently announced 750\\,GeV\ndiphoton excess by the ATLAS and the CMS experiments at the CERN LHC in a model\nwith multiple doubly charged particles, which was originally suggested for\nexplaining tiny neutrino masses through a three-loop effect in a natural way.\nThe enhanced radiatively generated effective coupling of a new singlet scalar\n$S$ with diphoton with multiple charged particles in the loop enlarges the\nproduction rate of $S$ in $pp\\to S+X$ via photon fusion process and also the\ndecay width $\\Gamma(S\\to \\gamma\\gamma)$ even without assuming a tree level\nproduction mechanism. We provide detailed analysis on the cases with or without\nallowing the mixing between $S$ and the standard model Higgs doublet.\n", "  This expanded version corrects some misprints of the first version, details\ncompletely the poof of Borel-Leroy summability and for $k=3$ in the complex\ncase provides a new improved representation which relies on ordinary convergent\nGaussian integrals rather than oscillatory integrals.\n", "  A fundamental open issue in physics is whether and how the fermion sign\nproblem in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations can be solved generically.\nHere, we show that Majorana-time-reversal (MTR) symmetries can provide a\nunifying principle to solve the fermion sign problem in interacting fermionic\nmodels. By systematically classifying Majorana-bilinear operators according to\nthe anti-commuting MTR symmetries they respect, we rigorously proved that there\nare two and only two fundamental symmetry classes which are sign-problem-free\nand which we call the \"Majorana class\" and \"Kramers class\", respectively. Novel\nsign-problem-free models in the Majorana class include interacting topological\nsuperconductors and interacting models of charge-4e superconductors. We believe\nthat our MTR unifying principle could shed new light on sign-problem-free QMC\nsimulation on strongly correlated systems and interacting topological matters.\n", "  A key challenge for neuroscience is noninvasive, label-free sensing of action\npotential (AP) dynamics in whole organisms with single-neuron resolution. Here,\nwe present a new approach to this problem: using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) quantum\ndefects in diamond to measure the time-dependent magnetic fields produced by\nsingle-neuron APs. Our technique has a unique combination of features: (i) it\nis noninvasive, as the light that probes the NV sensors stays within the\nbiocompatible diamond chip and does not enter the organism, enabling activity\nmonitoring over extended periods; (ii) it is label-free and should be widely\napplicable to most organisms; (iii) it provides high spatial and temporal\nresolution, allowing precise measurement of the AP waveforms and conduction\nvelocities of individual neurons; (iv) it directly determines AP propagation\ndirection through the inherent sensitivity of NVs to the associated AP magnetic\nfield vector; (v) it is applicable to neurons located within optically opaque\ntissue or whole organisms, through which magnetic fields pass largely\nunperturbed; and (vi) it is easy-to-use, scalable, and can be integrated with\nexisting techniques such as wide-field and superresolution imaging. We\ndemonstrate our method using excised single neurons from two invertebrate\nspecies, marine worm and squid; and then by single-neuron AP magnetic sensing\nexterior to whole, live, opaque marine worms for extended periods with no\nadverse effect. The results lay the groundwork for real-time, noninvasive 3D\nmagnetic mapping of functional neuronal networks, ultimately with synapse-scale\n(~10 nm) resolution and circuit-scale (~1 cm) field-of-view.\n", "  The production of particle-antiparticle pairs from the quantum field\ntheoretic ground state in the presence of an external electric field is\nstudied. Starting with the quantum kinetic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation in\nfour-dimensional spacetime, we obtain the corresponding equations in lower\ndimensionalities by way of spatial compactification. Our outcomes in\n$2+1$-dimensions are applied to bandgap graphene layers, where the charge\ncarriers have the particular property of behaving like light massive Dirac\nfermions. We calculate the single-particle distribution function for the case\nof an electric field oscillating in time and show that the creation of\nparticle-hole pairs in this condensed matter system closely resembles\nelectron-positron pair production by the Schwinger effect.\n", "  Weyl semimetal is a new quantum state of matter [1-12] hosting the condensed\nmatter physics counterpart of relativisticWeyl fermion [13] originally\nintroduced in high energy physics. The Weyl semimetal realized in the TaAs\nclass features multiple Fermi arcs arising from topological surface states [10,\n11, 14-16] and exhibits novel quantum phenomena, e.g., chiral anomaly induced\nnegative mag-netoresistance [17-19] and possibly emergent supersymmetry [20].\nRecently it was proposed theoretically that a new type (type-II) of Weyl\nfermion [21], which does not have counterpart in high energy physics due to the\nbreaking of Lorentz invariance, can emerge as topologically-protected touching\nbetween electron and hole pockets. Here, we report direct spectroscopic\nevidence of topological Fermi arcs in the predicted type-II Weyl semimetal\nMoTe2 [22-24]. The topological surface states are confirmed by directly\nobserving the surface states using bulk-and surface-sensitive angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and the quasi-particle interference (QPI)\npattern between the two putative Fermi arcs in scanning tunneling microscopy\n(STM). Our work establishes MoTe2 as the first experimental realization of\ntype-II Weyl semimetal, and opens up new opportunities for probing novel\nphenomena such as exotic magneto-transport [21] in type-II Weyl semimetals.\n", "  Very strong magnetoresistance and a resistivity plateau impeding low\ntemperature divergence due to insulating bulk are hallmarks of topological\ninsulators and are also present in topological semimetals where the plateau is\ninduced by magnetic field, when time-reversal symmetry (protecting surface\nstates in topological insulators) is broken. Similar features were observed in\na simple rock-salt-structure LaSb, leading to a suggestion of the possible\nnon-trivial topology of 2D states in this compound. We show that its sister\ncompound YSb is also characterized by giant magnetoresistance exceeding one\nthousand percent and low-temperature plateau of resistivity. We thus performed\nin-depth analysis of YSb Fermi surface by band calculations, magnetoresistance,\nand Shubnikov--de Haas effect measurements, which reveals only\nthree-dimensional Fermi sheets. Kohler scaling applied to magnetoresistance\ndata accounts very well for its low-temperature upturn behavior. The\nfield-angle-dependent magnetoresistance demonstrates a 3D-scaling yielding\neffective mass anisotropy perfectly agreeing with electronic structure and\nquantum oscillations analysis, thus providing further support for 3D-Fermi\nsurface scenario of magnetotransport, without necessity of invoking\ntopologically non-trivial 2D states. We discuss data implying that analogous\nfield-induced properties of LaSb can also be well understood in the framework\nof 3D multiband model.\n", "  Any quantum resource theory is based on free states and free operations,\ni.e., states and operations which can be created and performed at no cost. In\nthe resource theory of coherence free states are diagonal in some fixed basis,\nand free operations are those which cannot create coherence for some particular\nexperimental realization. Recently, some problems of this approach have been\ndiscussed, and new sets of operations have been proposed to resolve these\nproblems. As an example for such a problem, a quantum operation can be\nincoherent in one particular experimental realization, but it still can create\nlarge amount of coherence in another. This problem is resolved by the framework\nof genuine quantum coherence. Here, we investigate this concept further and\nstudy other more general sets of operations which cannot create coherence in\nany experimental realization. We analyze in detail the mathematical structure\nof this class of maps and use this to study possible state transformations\nunder these operations. We show that deterministic manipulation is severely\nlimited, even in the asymptotic settings. In particular, this framework does\nnot have a unique golden unit, i.e., there is no single state from which all\nother states can be created deterministically with the free operations. On the\nother hand, we show that these theories allow for a richer structure in what\ncomes to stochastic manipulation of states. In particular, we determine the\noptimal probability of conversion among pure states with genuinely incoherent\noperations. Still, the aforementioned limitations suggest that any reasonably\npowerful resource theory of coherence must contain free operations which can\npotentially create coherence in some experimental realization.\n", "  We consider discrete transformations ($C, P, T$ and $CP$) of baryon- and\nlepton-nonconserving processes. It has long been thought that values ($\\pm 1,\n\\pm i$) form the correct set of fermionic arbitrary phases for discrete\ntransformations. In this paper we show that this idea is not generally true. In\norder to count the number of fundamental fermions in a process, $F$ number has\nbeen introduced. According to our evaluation for any operator which breaks\n$B-L$ symmetry and violate $F$ number the set of values ($\\pm 1, \\pm i$) is not\nthe correct set of fermionic arbitrary phases, due to the fact that discrete\ntransformations of such operators will change by altering the fermionic phases\nfrom $\\pm 1$ to $\\pm i$.\n", "  We compute the ground state correlation functions of an exactly solvable\nchain of integer spins, recently introduced in [R. Movassagh and P. W. Shor,\narXiv:1408.1657], whose ground-state can be expressed in terms of a uniform\nsuperposition of all colored Motzkin paths. Our analytical results show that\nfor spin s$\\ge$2 there is a violation of the cluster decomposition property.\nThis has to be contrasted with s=1, where the cluster property holds.\nCorrespondingly, for s=1 one gets a light-cone profile in the propagation of\nexcitations after a local quench, while the cone is absent for s=2, as shown by\ntime dependent density-matrix-renormalization-group. Moreover, we introduce an\noriginal solvable model of half-integer spins which we refer to as Fredkin spin\nchain, whose ground-state can be expressed in terms of superposition of all\nDyck paths. For this model we exactly calculate the magnetization and\ncorrelation functions, finding that for s=1/2, a cone-like propagation occurs\nwhile for higher spins, s$\\ge$3/2, the colors prevent any cone formation and\nclustering is violated, together with square root deviation from the area law\nfor the entanglement entropy.\n", "  Swelling is a volumetric-growth process in which a porous material expands by\nspontaneous imbibition of additional pore fluid. Swelling is distinct from\nother growth processes in that it is inherently poromechanical: Local expansion\nof the pore structure requires that additional fluid be drawn from elsewhere in\nthe material, or into the material from across the boundaries. Here, we study\nthe swelling and subsequent drying of a sphere of hydrogel. We develop a\ndynamic model based on large-deformation poromechanics and the theory of ideal\nelastomeric gels, and we compare the predictions of this model with a series of\nexperiments performed with polyacrylamide spheres. We use the model and the\nexperiments to study the complex internal dynamics of swelling and drying, and\nto highlight the fundamentally transient nature of these strikingly different\nprocesses. Although we assume spherical symmetry, the model also provides\ninsight into the transient patterns that form and then vanish during swelling\nas well as the risk of fracture during drying.\n", "  In this work we compute the production of magnetic fields in models of axion\ninflation coupled to the hypercharge sector of the Standard Model through a\nChern-Simons interaction term. We make the simplest choice of a quadratic\ninflationary potential and use lattice simulations to calculate the magnetic\nfield strength, helicity and correlation length at the end of inflation. For\nsmall values of the axion-gauge field coupling strength the results agree with\nno-backreaction calculations and estimates found in the literature. For larger\ncouplings the helicity of the magnetic field differs from the no-backreaction\nestimate and depends strongly on the comoving wavenumber. We estimate the\npost-inflationary evolution of the magnetic field based on known results for\nthe evolution of helical and non-helical magnetic fields. The magnetic fields\nproduced by axion inflation with large couplings to $U(1)_Y$ can reach $B_{\\rm\neff} \\gtrsim 10^{-16}\\, {\\rm G}$, exhibiting a field strength $B_{\\rm phys}\n\\approx 10^{-13}\\, {\\rm G}$ and a correlation length $\\lambda_{\\rm\nphys}\\approx10\\, {\\rm pc}$. This result is insensitive to the exact value of\nthe coupling, as long as the coupling is large enough to allow for\ninstantaneous preheating. Depending on the assumptions for the physical\nprocesses that determine blazar properties, these fields can be found\nconsistent with blazar observations based on the value of $B_{\\rm eff}$.\nFinally, the intensity of the magnetic field for large coupling can be enough\nto satisfy the requirements for a recently proposed baryogenesis mechanism,\nwhich utilizes the chiral anomaly of the Standard Model.\n", "  Neurons within a population are strongly correlated, but how to simply\ncapture these correlations is still a matter of debate. Recent studies have\nshown that the activity of each cell is influenced by the population rate,\ndefined as the summed activity of all neurons in the population. However, an\nexplicit, tractable model for these interactions is still lacking. Here we\nbuild a probabilistic model of population activity that reproduces the firing\nrate of each cell, the distribution of the population rate, and the linear\ncoupling between them. This model is tractable, meaning that its parameters can\nbe learned in a few seconds on a standard computer even for large population\nrecordings. We inferred our model for a population of 160 neurons in the\nsalamander retina. In this population, single-cell firing rates depended in\nunexpected ways on the population rate. In particular, some cells had a\npreferred population rate at which they were most likely to fire. These complex\ndependencies could not be explained by a linear coupling between the cell and\nthe population rate. We designed a more general, still tractable model that\ncould fully account for these non-linear dependencies. We thus provide a simple\nand computationally tractable way to learn models that reproduce the dependence\nof each neuron on the population rate.\n", "  An isotropic component of high energy $\\gamma$-ray spectrum measured by Fermi\nLAT constrains the proton component of UHECR. The strongest restriction comes\nfrom the highest, $(580-820)$ GeV, energy bin. One more constraint on the\nproton component is provided by the IceCube upper bound on ultrahigh energy\ncosmogenic neutrino flux. We study the influence of these restrictions on the\nsource properties, such as evolution and distribution of sources, their energy\nspectrum and admixture of nuclei. We also study the sensitivity of restrictions\nto various Fermi LAT galactic foreground models (model B being less\nrestrictive), to the choice of extragalactic background light model and to\noverall normalization of the energy spectrum. We claim that the\n$\\gamma$-ray-cascade constraints are stronger than the neutrino ones, and that\nhowever many proton models are viable. The basic parameters of such models are\nrelatively large $\\gamma_g$ and not very large $z_{\\max}$. The allowance for\nH$e^4$ admixture also relaxes the restrictions. However we foresee that future\nCTA measurements of $\\gamma$-ray spectrum at $E_\\gamma \\simeq (600 - 800)$ GeV,\nas well as resolving of more individual $\\gamma$-ray sources, may rule out the\nproton-dominated cosmic ray models.\n", "  Motivated by the discovery of spiral and modulated collinear phases in\nseveral magnetic materials, we investigate the magnetic properties of\nHeisenberg spin S=1/2 antiferromagnets in 2 and 3 dimensions, with frustration\narising from 2nd-neighbor couplings in one axial direction (the ANNNH model).\nOur results clearly demonstrate the presence of an incommensurate spiral phase\nat T=0 in 2 dimensions, extending to finite temperatures in 3 dimensions. The\ncrossover between N\\'eel and spiral order occurs at a value of the frustration\nparameter considerably above the classical value 0.25, a sign of substantial\nquantum fluctuations. We also investigate a possible modulated collinear phase\nwith a wavelength of 4 lattice spacings, and find that it has substantially\nhigher energy and hence is not realized in the model.\n", "  We propose a method to determine the trilinear Higgs self coupling that is\nalternative to the direct measurement of Higgs pair production total cross\nsections and differential distributions. The method relies on the effects that\nelectroweak loops featuring an anomalous trilinear coupling would imprint on\nsingle Higgs production at the LHC. We first calculate these contributions to\nall the phenomenologically relevant Higgs production ($gg{\\rm F}$, VBF, $WH$,\n$ZH$, $t\\bar tH$) and decay ($\\gamma \\gamma$, $WW^{*}/ZZ^{*}\\to 4f$, $b\\bar b$,\n$\\tau \\tau$) modes at the LHC and then estimate the sensitivity to the\ntrilinear coupling via a one-parameter fit to the single Higgs measurements at\nthe LHC 8 TeV. We find that the bounds on the self coupling are already\ncompetitive with those from Higgs pair production and will be further improved\nin the current and next LHC runs.\n", "  We propose a multilayer device comprising of a thin-film-based ferromagnetic\nhetero-structure (FMH) deposited on a diamond layer doped with nitrogen vacancy\ncenters (NVC's). We find that when the NVC's are in close proximity (1-2 nm)\nwith the FMH, the exchange energy is comparable to, and may even surpass the\nmagnetostatic interaction energy. This calls for the need to consider and\nutilize both effects in magnetometry based on NVC's in diamond. As the distance\nbetween the FMH and NVC is decreased to the sub-nanometer scale, the\nexponential increase in the exchange energy suggests spintronic applications of\nNVC beyond magnetometry, such as detection of spin-Hall effect or spin\ncurrents.\n", "  We study cold and hot nuclear matter effects on charmonium production in p+Pb\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_\\text{NN}}=5.02$ TeV in a transport approach. At the\nforward rapidity, the cold medium effect on all the $c\\bar c$ states and the\nhot medium effect on the excited $c\\bar c$ states only can explain well the\n$J/\\psi$ and $\\psi'$ yield and transverse momentum distribution measured by the\nALICE collaboration, and we predict a significantly larger $\\psi'$ $p_\\text{T}$\nbroadening in comparison with $J/\\psi$. However, we can not reproduce the\n$J/\\psi$ and $\\psi'$ data at the backward rapidity with reasonable cold and hot\nmedium effects.\n", "  A quantum phase transition (QPT), including both topological and symmetry\nbreaking types, is usually induced by the change of global parameters, such as\nexternal fields or global coupling constants. In this work, we demonstrate the\nexistence of QPT induced by the real-space topology of the system. We\ninvestigate the groundstate properties of the tight-binding model on a\nhoneycomb lattice with the torus geometry based on exact results. It is shown\nthat the ground state experiences a second- order QPT, exhibiting the scaling\nbehavior, when the torus switches to a tube, which reveals the connection\nbetween quantum phase and the real-space topology of the system.\n", "  In a broad class of complex materials a quench leads to a multi-scaled\nrelaxation process known as aging. To explain its commonality and the\nastounding insensitivity to most microscopic details, record dynamics (RD)\nposits that a small set of increasingly rare and irreversible events, so called\nquakes, controls the dynamics. While key predictions of RD are known to concur\nwith a number of experimental and simulational results, its basic assumption on\nthe nature of quake statistics has proven extremely difficult to verify\nexperimentally. The careful distinction of rare (\"record\") cage-breaking events\nfrom in-cage rattle accomplished in previous experiments on jammed colloids,\nenables us to extract the first direct experimental evidence for the\nfundamental hypothesis of RD that the rate of quakes decelerates with the\ninverse of the system age. The resulting description shows the predicted growth\nof the particle mean square displacement and of a mesoscopic lengthscale with\nthe logarithm of time.\n", "  We study domain walls which can be created in the Standard Model under the\nassumption that it is valid up to very high energy scales. We focus on domain\nwalls interpolating between the physical electroweak vacuum and the global\nminimum appearing at very high field strengths. The creation of the network\nwhich ends up in the electroweak vacuum percolating through the Universe is not\nas difficult to obtain as one may expect, although it requires certain tuning\nof initial conditions. Our numerical simulations confirm that such domain walls\nwould swiftly decay and thus cannot dominate the Universe. We discuss the\npossibility of detection of gravitational waves produced in this scenario. We\nhave found that for the standard cosmology the energy density of these\ngravitational waves is too small to be observed in present and planned\ndetectors.\n", "  We consider a spin~-~3/2 fermionic dark matter candidate (DM) interacting\nwith Standard Model fermions through a vector mediator in the $s$-channel. We\nfind that for pure vector couplings almost the entire parameter space of the DM\nand mediator mass consistent with the observed relic density is ruled out by\nthe direct detection observations through DM-nucleon elastic scattering\ncross-sections. In contrast, for pure axial-vector coupling, the most stringent\nconstraints are obtained from mono-jet searches at the Large Hadron Collider.\n", "  Local spectral functions and Nuclear Magnetic Relaxation (NMR) rates, 1/T1,\nfor the spin-half Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Kagome Lattice are\ncalculated using Moriyas Gaussian approximation, as well as through an\nextrapolation of multiple frequency moments. The temperature dependence of the\ncalculated rates is compared with the oxygen 1/T1 NMR data in Herbertsmithite.\nWe find that the Gaussian approximation for 1/T1 shows behavior qualitatively\nsimilar to experiments with a sharp drop in rates at low temperatures,\nconsistent with a spin-gapped behavior. However, this approximation\nsignificantly underestimates the magnitude of 1/T1 even at room temperature.\nRates obtained from extrapolation of multiple frequency moments give very good\nagreement with the room temperature NMR data with J = 195 +/- 20 K and\nhyperfine couplings determined independently from other measurements. The use\nof multiple frequency moments also leads to additional low frequency weight in\nthe local structure factors. The convergence of our calculations with higher\nfrequency moments breaks down at low temperatures suggesting the existence of\nlonger range dynamic correlations in the system despite the very short-range\nstatic correlations.\n", "  We give some estimates for the light-quark mass dependence of the pole\nposition of the sigma ($f_{0}(500)$) resonance in the complex energy plane,\nwith the help of a chiral Lagrangian for the resonance field and some input\nfrom hadronic models constrained by Chiral Perturbation Theory and elastic\nunitarity. We also speculate on the fate of the sigma resonance when the quark\nmasses become unphysically large.\n", "  We study the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction between magnetic\nimpurities embedded in $p$-doped transition metal dichalcogenide triangular\nflakes. The role of underlying symmetries is exposed by analyzing the\ninteraction as a function of impurity separation along zigzag and armchair\ntrajectories, in specific parts of the sample. The large spin-orbit coupling in\nthese materials produces strongly anisotropic interactions, including a\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya component that can be sizable and tunable. We consider\nimpurities hybridized to different orbitals of the host transition-metal and\nidentify specific characteristics for onsite and hollow site adsorption. In the\nonsite case, the different components of the interaction have similar\nmagnitude, while for the hollow site, the Ising component dominates. We also\nstudy the dependence of the interaction with the level of hole doping, which\nsupplies a further degree of tunability. Our results could provide ways of\ncontrolling helical long range spin order in magnetic impurity arrays embedded\nin these materials.\n", "  We analyze ${\\rm AdS}_3$ superparticle dynamics on the coset ${\\rm OSP}(1|2)\n\\times {\\rm OSP}(1|2)/{\\rm SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})$. The system is quantized in\ncanonical coordinates obtained by gauge invariant Hamiltonian reduction. The\nleft and right Noether charges of a massive particle are parametrized by\ncoadjoint orbits of a timelike element of $\\frak{osp}(1|2)$. Each chiral sector\nis described by two bosonic and two fermionic canonical coordinates\ncorresponding to a superparticle with superpotential $W=q-m/q$, where $m$ is\nthe particle mass. Canonical quantization then provides a quantum realization\nof $\\frak{osp}(1|2)\\oplus\\frak{osp}(1|2)$. For the massless particle the chiral\ncharges lie on the coadjoint orbit of a nilpotent element of $\\frak{osp}(1|2)$\nand each of them depends only on one real fermion, which demonstrates the\nunderlying $\\kappa$-symmetry. These remaining left and right fermionic\nvariables form a canonical pair and the system is described by four bosonic and\ntwo fermionic canonical coordinates. Due to conformal invariance of the\nmassless particle, the $\\frak{osp}(1|2)\\oplus\\frak{osp} (1|2)$ extends to the\ncorresponding superconformal algebra $\\frak{osp}(2|4)$. Its 19 charges are\ngiven by all real quadratic combinations of the canonical coordinates, which\ntrivializes their quantization.\n", "  We find new ferromagnetic semiconductors, Cr-doped BaZn2As2, by employing a\ncombined method of the density functional theory and the quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulation. Due to a narrow band gap of 0.2 eV in host BaZn2As2 and the\ndifferent hybridization of 3d orbitals of Cr impurity, the impurity bound\nstates have been induced both below the top of valence band and above the\nbottom of conduction band. The long-range ferromagnetic coupling between Cr\nimpurities is obtained with both p- and n-type carriers.\n", "  We aim to search for a connection between an invariant minimum speed that\nbreaks down the Lorentz symmetry and the Gravitational Bose Einstein Condensate\n(GBEC), which is the central core of a star of gravitating vacuum\n(Gravastar/Dark Energy Star) by introducing a cosmological constant into\ncompact objects. This model was designed to circumvent the embarrassment\ngenerated by the paradoxes of a singularity as the final stage of a\ngravitational collapse, by introducing in place of the singularity of event\nhorizon a spatial-temporal phase transition, a concept with which the causal\nstructure of Symmetrical Special Relativity (SSR) helps us to elucidate by\nproviding a quantum interpretation for GBEC and explaining the origin of\nanisotropy, which has been introduced in ad-hoc way before in the literature.\n", "  The validity of the superposition principle and of Born's rule are\nwell-accepted tenants of quantum mechanics. Surprisingly, it has recently been\npredicted that the intensity pattern formed in a three-slit experiment is\nseemingly in contradiction with the predictions of the most conventional form\nof the superposition principle when exotic looped trajectories are taken into\naccount. However, the probability of observing such paths is typically very\nsmall and thus rendering them extremely difficult to measure. In this work, we\nconfirm the validity of Born's rule and present the first experimental\nobservation of these exotic trajectories as additional paths for the light by\ndirectly measuring their contribution to the formation of optical interference\nfringes. We accomplish this by enhancing the electromagnetic near-fields in the\nvicinity of the slits through the excitation of surface plasmons. This process\neffectively increases the probability of occurrence of these exotic\ntrajectories, demonstrating that they are related to the near-field component\nof the photon's wavefunction.\n", "  We study the seasonal changes in the thickness distribution of Arctic sea\nice, $g(h)$, under climate forcing. Our analytical and numerical approach is\nbased on a Fokker-Planck equation for $g(h)$ (Toppaladoddi \\& Wettlaufer\n\\emph{Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\\bf 115}, 148501, 2015), in which the thermodynamic\ngrowth rates are determined using observed climatology. In particular, the\nFokker-Planck equation is coupled to the observationally consistent\nthermodynamic model of Eisenman \\& Wettlaufer (\\emph{Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.\nUSA} {\\bf 106}, pp. 28-32, 2009). We find that due to the combined effects of\nthermodynamics and mechanics, $g(h)$ spreads during winter and contracts during\nsummer. This behavior is in agreement with recent satellite observations from\nCryoSat-2 (Kwok \\& Cunningham, \\emph{Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A} {\\bf 373},\n20140157, 2015). Because $g(h)$ is a probability density function, we quantify\nall of the key moments (e.g., mean thickness, fraction of thin/thick ice, mean\nalbedo, relaxation time scales) as greenhouse-gas radiative forcing, $\\Delta\nF_0$, increases. The mean ice thickness decays exponentially with $\\Delta F_0$,\nbut {\\em much slower} than do solely thermodynamic models. This exhibits the\ncrucial role that ice mechanics plays in maintaining the ice cover, by\nredistributing thin ice to thick ice--far more rapidly than can thermal growth\nalone.\n", "  Although major advances have been achieved over the past decades for the\nreduction and identification of linear systems, deriving nonlinear low-order\nmodels still is a chal- lenging task. In this work, we develop a new\ndata-driven framework to identify nonlinear reduced-order models of a fluid by\ncombining dimensionality reductions techniques (e.g. proper orthogonal\ndecomposition) and sparse regression techniques from machine learn- ing. In\nparticular, we extend the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy)\nalgorithm to enforce physical constraints in the regression, namely\nenergy-preserving quadratic nonlinearities. The resulting models, hereafter\nreferred to as Galerkin regression models, incorporate many beneficial aspects\nof Galerkin projection, but without the need for a full-order or high-fidelity\nsolver to project the Navier-Stokes equations. Instead, the most parsimonious\nnonlinear model is determined that is consistent with observed mea- surement\ndata and satisfies necessary constraints. Galerkin regression models also\nreadily generalize to include higher-order nonlinear terms that model the\neffect of truncated modes. The effectiveness of Galerkin regression is\ndemonstrated on two different flow configurations: the two-dimensional flow\npast a circular cylinder and the shear-driven cavity flow. For both cases, the\naccuracy of the identified models compare favorably against reduced-order\nmodels obtained from a standard Galerkin projection procedure. Present results\nhighlight the importance of cubic nonlinearities in the construction of\naccurate nonlinear low-dimensional approximations of the flow systems,\nsomething which cannot be readily obtained using a standard Galerkin projection\nof the Navier-Stokes equations. Finally, the entire code base for our\nconstrained sparse Galerkin regression algorithm is freely available online.\n", "  We present new observations of the nebula around the Magellanic candidate\nLuminous Blue Variable S61. These comprise high-resolution data acquired with\nthe Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), the Atacama Large\nMillimetre/Submillimetre Array (ALMA), and VISIR at the Very Large Telescope\n(VLT). The nebula was detected only in the radio, up to 17 GHz. The 17 GHz ATCA\nmap, with 0.8 arcsec resolution, allowed a morphological comparison with the\nH$\\alpha$ Hubble Space Telescope image. The radio nebula resembles a spherical\nshell, as in the optical. The spectral index map indicates that the radio\nemission is due to free-free transitions in the ionised, optically thin gas,\nbut there are hints of inhomogeneities. We present our new public code RHOCUBE\nto model 3D density distributions, and determine via Bayesian inference the\nnebula's geometric parameters. We applied the code to model the electron\ndensity distribution in the S61 nebula. We found that different distributions\nfit the data, but all of them converge to the same ionised mass, ~0.1 $\\rm\nM\\odot$, which is an order of magnitude smaller than previous estimates. We\nshow how the nebula models can be used to derive the mass-loss history with\nhigh-temporal resolution. The nebula was probably formed through stellar winds,\nrather than eruptions. From the ALMA and VISIR non-detections, plus the derived\nextinction map, we deduce that the infrared emission observed by space\ntelescopes must arise from extended, diffuse dust within the ionised region.\n", "  A sealed high gas pressure detector working in pure argon is assembled. It\nconsists of a 5 cm $\\times$ 5 cm PCB THGEM (THick Gaseous Electron\nMultipliers). The detector structure and experimental setup are described. The\nperformances under high pressure of 2 atm mainly consist in selecting optimal\nvoltages for ionization region and induction region. The dependence of the\nshape of Alpha particle spectra measured with relative gas gain on gas pressure\n(1.3 $\\sim$ 2.0 atm) has been studied. The 8 groups of relative gas gain versus\nworking voltage of THGEM expressed by weighting filed $E/P$ are normalized,\nbeing consistent with theory. The results show that the air tightness of the\nchamber is good measured by a sensitive barometer and checked with gas gain.\nThe experimental results are compared with Monte Carlo simulation on energy\ndeposition without gas gain involved.\n", "  Kerr frequency combs with depressed harmonic at the optical pump frequency\nare theoretically explained and experimentally demonstrated. This result is\nachieved in a MgF$_2$ photonic belt resonator having reduced density of modes\nin its spectrum and configured with the add-drop optical couplers. \\copyright\n2016 California Institute of Technology. Government sponsorship\n", "  The deliberate insertion of magnetic Mn dopants in the Fe sites of the\noptimally-doped SmFeAsO0.88-F0.12 iron-based superconductor can modify in a\ncontrolled way its electronic properties. The resulting phase diagram was\ninvestigated across a wide range of manganese contents (x) by means of\nmuon-spin spectroscopy (muSR), both in zero- and in transverse fields,\nrespectively, to probe the magnetic and the superconducting order. The pure\nsuperconducting phase (at x < 0.03) is replaced by a crossover region at\nintermediate Mn values (0.03 =< x < 0.08), where superconductivity coexists\nwith static magnetic order. After completely suppressing superconductivity for\nx = 0.08, a further increase in Mn content reinforces the natural tendency\ntowards antiferromagnetic correlations among the magnetic Mn ions. The sharp\ndrop of Tc and the induced magnetic order in the presence of magnetic\ndisorder/dopants, such as Mn, are both consistent with a recent theoretical\nmodel of unconventional superconductors [M. Gastiasoro et al., ArXiv\n1606.09495], which includes correlation-enhanced RKKY-couplings between the\nimpurity moments.\n", "  Volume I of two.

Here we report the $^{185/187}$Re nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR)\nmeasurements on Re$_6$Zr ($T_c$ = 6.72 K) and the isostructural compounds\nRe$_{27}$Zr$_{5}$ ($T_c$ = 6.53 K) and Re$_{24}$Zr$_{5}$ ($T_c$ = 5.00 K). The\nnuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ shows a coherence peak below $T_c$\nand decreases exponentially at low temperatures in all three samples. The\nsuperconducting gap $\\Delta$ derived from the $1/T_1$ data is $2\\Delta =3.58 $\n$k_BT_c$, 3.55 $k_BT_c$, and 3.51 $k_BT_c$ for Re$_6$Zr ,Re$_{27}$Zr$_{5}$, and\nRe$_{24}$Zr$_{5}$, respectively, which is close to the value of 3.53 $k_BT_c$\nexpected for weak-coupling superconductivity. These data suggest conventional\n$s$-wave superconductivity with a fully-opened gap in this series of compounds.\n", "  Toroidal Alfven eigenmodes (TAEs) excited in purely ohmically heated plasmas\nwithout any auxiliary heating have been identified for the first time in the\nSUNIST spherical tokamak. The TAE modes are observed during minor disruptions\nand have a frequency range of 150-500 kHz. The mode structure analysis\nindicates the existence of both m/n=-3/-1 and -4/-1 harmonics, propagating in\nthe electron diamagnetic direction in the laboratory frame of reference. These\nTAEs appear simultaneously with the generation of runaway electrons in the\ncurrent quench phase, accompanying with the density sweeping during the minor\ndisruption. Possible driving mechanisms and potential applications of these\nTAEs are discussed.\n", "  We investigate the radial-overlap part of the isospin-symmetry breaking\ncorrection to superallowed $0^+\\to 0^+$-decay using the shell-model approach\nsimilar to that of Refs. [1, 2]. The 8 sd-shell emitters with masses between\n$A=22$ and $A=38$ have been re-examined. The Fermi matrix element is evaluated\nwith realistic spherical single-particle wave functions, obtained from\nspherical Woods-Saxon (WS) or Hartree-Fock (HF) potentials, fine-tuned to\nreproduce the experimental data on charge radii and separation energies for\nnuclei of interest. The elaborated adjustment procedure removes any sensitivity\nof the correction to a specific parametrisation of the WS potential or to\nvarious versions of the Skyrme interaction. The present results are generally\nin good agreement with those reported in Refs. [3, 4]. At the same time, we\nfind that the calculations with HF wave functions result in systematically\nlower values of the correction.\n", "  Infinite-range interactions are known to facilitate the production of highly\nentangled states with applications in quantum information and metrology.\nHowever, many experimental systems have interactions that decay with distance,\nand the achievable benefits in this context are much less clear. Combining\nrecent exact solutions with a controlled expansion in the system size, we\nanalyze quench dynamics in Ising models with power-law ($1/r^{\\alpha}$)\ninteractions in $D$ dimensions, thereby expanding the understanding of spin\nsqueezing into a broad and experimentally relevant context. In spatially\nhomogeneous systems, we show that for small $\\alpha$ the scaling of squeezing\nwith system size is identical to the infinite-range ($\\alpha=0$) case. This\nindifference to the interaction range persists up to a critical value\n$\\alpha=2D/3$, above which squeezing degrades continuously. Boundary-induced\ninhomogeneities present in most experimental systems modify this picture, but\nit nevertheless remains qualitatively correct for finite-sized systems.\n", "  The latest results from the search for a Standard Model Higgs boson produced\nin association with a top quark pair ($\\mathrm{t\\bar{t}H}$) at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$\nTeV decaying to final states with multiple leptons is presented using the 2016\ndataset from the CMS experiment. The Higgs decays into either WW*, ZZ*, or\n$\\tau\\tau$, and the top quark pair decays considered are either fully leptonic,\nor semi-leptonic. The leptons defining the final states are muons and/or\nelectrons. The overall analysis strategy, as well as new techniques with\nrespect to the 2015 results are outlined.\n", "  Marsh et al. (2016) have recently reported the discovery of a radio-pulsing\nwhite dwarf in the cataclysmic variable AR Sco. The period of pulsations which\nare also seen in the optical and UV is about 117 seconds. High intensity of\npulsing radiation and non-thermal character of its spectrum leave little room\nfor doubt that the white dwarf in AR Sco operates as a spin-powered pulsar and,\ntherefore, is in the ejector state. We show that this system is very much\nresembling a well-known object AE Aqr. In both systems the compact components\nare spin-powered and have relatively strong surface magnetic field of order of\n100-500 MG. They originated due to accretion spin-up in the previous epoch\nduring which the magnetic field of the white dwarf had substantially evolved\nbeing initially buried by the accreted matter and recovered to its initial\nvalue after the spin-up phase had ended.\n", "  We develop a framework to uncover and analyze dynamical anomalies from\nmassive, nonlinear and non-stationary time series data. The framework consists\nof three steps: preprocessing of massive data sets to eliminate erroneous data\nsegments, application of the empirical mode decomposition and Hilbert transform\nparadigm to obtain the fundamental components embedded in the time series at\ndistinct time scales, and statistical/scaling analysis of the components. As a\ncase study, we apply our framework to detecting and characterizing high\nfrequency oscillations (HFOs) from a big database of rat EEG recordings. We\nfind a striking phenomenon: HFOs exhibit on-off intermittency that can be\nquantified by algebraic scaling laws. Our framework can be generalized to big\ndata-related problems in other fields such as large-scale sensor data and\nseismic data analysis.\n", "  We present novel approaches for solving Milne's equation, which was\nintroduced in 1930 as an efficient numerical scheme for the Schr\\\"odinger\nequation. Milne's equation appears in a wide class of physical problems,\nranging from astrophysics and cosmology, to quantum mechanics and quantum\noptics. We show how a third order linear differential equation is equivalent to\nMilne's non-linear equation, and can be used to accurately calculate Milne's\namplitude and phase functions. We also introduce optimization schemes to\nachieve a convenient, fast, and accurate computation of wave functions using an\neconomical parametrization. These new optimization procedures answer the long\nstanding question of finding non-oscillatory solutions of Milne's equation. We\napply them to long-range potentials and find numerically exact asymptotic\nsolutions.\n", "  Strong resonant dipole-dipole interactions in flexible Rydberg aggregates\nenable the formation of exciton pulses, the interplay of atomic motion and\nelectronic excitation transfer which feature high fidelity entanglement\ntransport.\n  Here, we demonstrate the coherent splitting of such pulses into two modes,\nwhich induce strongly different atomic motion, leading to clear signatures of\nnonadiabatic effects in atomic density profiles. The mechanism exploits local\nnonadiabatic effects at a conical intersection, turning them from a decoherence\nsource into an asset. The conical intersection is a consequence of the exciton\npulses moving along a linear Rydberg chain and approaching an additional\nlinear, perpendicularly aligned Rydberg chain. The intersection provides a\nsensitive knob controlling the propagation direction and coherence properties\nof exciton pulses.\n  We demonstrate that this scenario can be exploited as an exciton switch,\ncontrolling direction and coherence properties of the joint pulse on the second\nof the chains. Initially, we demonstrate the pulse splitting on planar\naggregates with atomic motion one-dimensionally constrained and employing\nisotropic interactions. Subsequently, we confirm the splitting mechanism for a\nfully realistic scenario in which all spatial restrictions are removed and the\nfull anisotropy of the dipole-dipole interactions is taken into account. Our\nresults enable the experimental observation of non-adiabatic electronic\ndynamics and entanglement transport with Rydberg atoms. The conical\nintersection crossings are clearly evident, both in atomic mean position\ninformation and excited state spectra of the Rydberg system. This suggests\nflexible Rydberg aggregates as a test-bench for quantum chemical effects in\nexperiments on much-inflated length scales. The fundamental ideas discussed\nhere have general implications for excitons on a dynamic network.\n", "  The volume of a black hole under noncommutative spacetime background is found\nto be infinite, in contradiction with the surface area of a black hole, or its\nBekenstein-Hawking (BH) entropy, which is well-known to be finite. Our result\nrules out the possibility of interpreting the entropy of a black hole by\ncounting the number of modes wrapped inside its surface if the final\nevaporation stage can be properly treated. It implies the statistical\ninterpretation for the BH entropy can be independent of the volume, provided\nspacetime is noncommutative. The effect of radiation back reaction is found to\nbe small and doesn't influence the above conclusion.\n", "  The past decade has witnessed a dramatic acceleration of lattice quantum\nchromodynamics calculations in nuclear and particle physics. This has been due\nto both significant progress in accelerating the iterative linear solvers using\nmulti-grid algorithms, and due to the throughput improvements brought by GPUs.\nDeploying hierarchical algorithms optimally on GPUs is non-trivial owing to the\nlack of parallelism on the coarse grids, and as such, these advances have not\nproved multiplicative. Using the QUDA library, we demonstrate that by exposing\nall sources of parallelism that the underlying stencil problem possesses, and\nthrough appropriate mapping of this parallelism to the GPU architecture, we can\nachieve high efficiency even for the coarsest of grids. Results are presented\nfor the Wilson-Clover discretization, where we demonstrate up to 10x speedup\nover present state-of-the-art GPU-accelerated methods on Titan. Finally, we\nlook to the future, and consider the software implications of our findings.\n", "  The mis-aligned active galactic nuclei (AGN), 3C\\,84, has been observed\napproximately monthly at four frequencies simultaneously (22\\,GHz -- 129\\,GHz)\non the Korean VLBI Network (KVN) since 2013 as part of the interferometric\nmonitoring of $\\gamma$-ray bright AGN (iMOGABA) program. 3C\\,84 is known to\nhave to sites of bright radio emission, with the first thought to be near the\ncentral super-massive black hole and the second in a slowly moving emission\nfeature, several milliarcseconds south of the core. Analysis of this data\nsuggests that the highly variable Gamma-ray emission originates near the SMBH\nand the slowly rising $\\gamma$-ray emission originates in the slow moving\nfeature.\n", "  We put forward a fundamental relationship between the normalized spectral\ndensity of excess current noise and the imaginary part of complex conductivity.\n", "  In this paper, we present results obtained from the measurements of radio\nemission at frequency of 32 MHz with energy more than 10$^{19}$ eV. Generalized\nformula that describe lateral distribution and depends on main characteristic\nof the air showers: energy E$_0$ and depth of maximum X$_{max}$ was derived.\nThe formula has a good agreement with data at average and large distances from\nshower axis. Employing the ratio of radio emission amplitude at distances 175 m\nand 725 m we determined the depth of maximum X$_{max}$ for air shower with\nenergy 3.7$\\cdot$10$^{19}$ eV, which in our case is equal to X$_{max}$ =\n769$\\pm$34g$\\cdot$cm$^{-2}$.\n", "  We report the existence of self-propelled Janus droplets driven by phase\nseparation, which are able to deliver cargo in a programmable manner. The\nself-propelling droplets are initially formed by a water/ethanol mixture in a\nsqualane/monoolein solution, and evolve in up to three stages depending on\nethanol concentration. In the first stage, the droplet propulsion is generated\nby Marangoni flow originating from the solubilization of ethanol in the oily\nphase. During this process the droplets absorb surfactant molecules; in\ncombination with the continuous loss of ethanol this leads to a phase\nseparation of the water/ethanol/monoolein mixture and the formation of Janus\ndroplets, i.e. a water-rich droplet connected to an ethanol-rich droplet that\nis able to deliver cargo. We characterize the different evolution stages of\nself-propulsion by the flow field around the droplet that evolves from a weak\npusher, over a neutral swimmer, to a dimer of neutral swimmers. Finally, we\nutilize this active system to deliver DNA as a cargo. Tuning the delay time\nbefore phase separation, by varying the chemical composition of the droplets,\nseveral different cargo delivery processes can be programmed.\n", "  Kinetic or Boltzmann schemes are interesting alternatives to the macroscopic\nnumerical methods for solving the hyperbolic conservation laws of gas dynamics.\nThey utilize the particle-based description instead of the wave propagation\nmodels. While the continuous particle velocity based upwind schemes were\ndeveloped in the earlier decades, the discrete velocity Boltzmann schemes\nintroduced in the last decade are found to be simpler and are easier to handle.\nIn this work, we introduce a novel way of introducing discrete velocities which\ncorrespond to the physical wave speeds and formulate a discrete velocity\nBoltzmann scheme for solving Euler equations.\n", "  The objective of this paper is to present the main characteristics of a\nwide-field MFAA precursor that we envisage to be built at the SKA site in South\nAfrica. Known as MANTIS (the Mid-Frequency Aperture Array Transient and\nIntensity-Mapping System), this ambitious instrument will represent the next\nlogical step towards the MFAA based SKA telescope. The goal is to use\ninnovative aperture array technology at cm wavelengths, in order to demonstrate\nthe feasibility of deploying huge collecting areas at modest construction and\noperational cost. Such a transformative step is required in order to continue\nthe exponential progress in radio telescope performance, and to make the\nambitious scale of the SKA Phase 2 a realistic near-time proposition.\n", "  The well-known (1+1D) nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NSE) governs the\npropagation of narrow-band pulses in optical fibers and others one-dimensional\nstructures. For exploration the evolution of broad-band optical pulses\n(femtosecond and attosecond) it is necessary to use the more general nonlinear\namplitude equation (GNAE) which differs from NSE with two additional\nnon-paraxial terms. That is way, it is important to make clear the difference\nbetween the solutions of these two equations. We found a new analytical soliton\nsolution of GNAE and compare it with the well-known NSE one. It is shown that\nfor the fundamental soliton the main difference between the two solutions is in\ntheir phases. It appears that, this changes significantly the evolution of\noptical pulses in multisoliton regime of propagation and admits a behavior\ndifferent from that of the higher-order NSE solitons.\n", "  Heavy Majorana neutrinos enter in many scenarios of physics beyond the\nStandard Model and play a special role in the leptogenesis framework as origin\nof the baryon asymmetry in the universe. In this thesis, we develop an\neffective field theory for non-relativistic Majorana particles. We apply the\neffective field theory so obtained to address calculations in a hot medium\nwhich models the early stages of the universe evolution. In particular, we\napply it to the case of a heavy Majorana neutrino decaying in a hot plasma of\nStandard Model particles, whose temperature is much smaller than the mass of\nthe Majorana neutrino but still much larger than the electroweak scale, and the\nderivation of the neutrino thermal width is revisited in an EFT fashion.\nAssuming the same hierarchy between heavy neutrino masses and the temperature,\nwe compute systematically thermal corrections to the direct and indirect CP\nasymmetries in the Majorana neutrino decays. These are key ingredients entering\nthe equations that describe the thermodynamic evolution of the induced\nlepton-number asymmetry eventually leading to the baryon asymmetry in the\nuniverse. We consider the case of two Majorana neutrinos with nearly degenerate\nmasses, that allows for a resonant enhancement of the CP asymmetry, and a\nhierarchical spectrum with one heavy neutrino much lighter than the other\nneutrino species. Flavour effects are also taken into account in the derivation\nof the CP asymmetries at finite temperature.\n", "  This work is devoted to study the global behavior of viscous flows contained\nin a symmetric domain with complete slip boundary. In such scenario the\nboundary no longer provides friction and therefore the perturbation of angular\nvelocity lacks decaying structure. In fact, we show the existence of uniformly\nrotating solutions as steady states for the compressible Navier-Stokes\nequations. By manipulating the conservation law of angular momentum, we\nestablish a suitable Korn's type inequality to control the perturbation and\nshow the asymptotic stability of the uniformly rotating solutions with small\nangular velocity. In particular, the initial perturbation which preserves the\nangular momentum would decay exponentially in time and the solution to the\nNavier-Stokes equations converges to the steady state as time grows up.\n", "  Two of the three gases that display isenthalpic Joule-Thomson (J-T) warming\nunder laboratory conditions are hydrogen and helium, the main constituents of\nthe solar plasma, but the temperatures that are attained by this route are at\nmost a few hundred K. Increases in ion temperature by several orders of\nmagnitude are claimed for hydrogen plasmas subject to expansion into a vacuum;\nmodest increases are reported for the shortlived tests of this effect that have\nbeen carried out in space in the wakes of artificial satellites and of the\nMoon. Attempts to calculate the J-T coefficient at very high temperatures using\nequations of state and thermodynamics remain very preliminary. The potential\ncontribution of plasma expansion to heating of the solar corona must therefore\nbe assessed empirically, but this is consistent with how the J-T effect was\nfirst identified. The sunspot record, EUV measurements by the EVE instrument on\nthe SDO satellite, and solar wind fluctuations documented by the ACE satellite\nindicate broadly coherent periodicity from the photosphere to the outer corona\nconsistent with a non-pulsatory heating process. It comprises three successive\nstages characterised by induction, the J-T mechanism, and plasma expansion.\nAstronomical data may therefore be used to derive rather than to test an\nextension of the J-T effect which could help to explain heating in other solar\nsystem bodies and other stellar coronae.\n", "  We derive the Bayes estimator for the parameters of a multinomial\ndistribution under two loss functions ($1-B$ and $1-B^2$) that are based on the\nBhattacharyya coefficient $B(\\vec{p},\\vec{q}) = \\sum{\\sqrt{p_kq_k}}$. We\nformulate a non-commutative generalization relevant to quantum probability\ntheory as an open problem. As an example application, we use our solution to\nfind minimax estimators for a binomial parameter under Bhattacharyya loss\n($1-B^2$).\n", "  The optical properties of molecules close to plasmonic nanostructures greatly\ndiffer from their isolated molecule counterparts. To theoretically investigate\nsuch systems in a Quantum Chemistry perspective, one has to take into account\nthat the plasmonic nanostructure (e.g., a metal nanoparticle - NP) is often too\nlarge to be treated atomistically. Therefore, a multiscale description, where\nthe molecule is treated by an ab initio approach and the metal NP by a lower\nlevel description, is needed. Here we present an extension of one such\nmultiscale model [Corni, S.; Tomasi, J. {\\it J. Chem. Phys.} {\\bf 2001}, {\\it\n114}, 3739] originally inspired by the Polarizable Continuum Model, to a\nreal-time description of the electronic dynamics of the molecule and of the NP.\nIn particular, we adopt a Time-Dependent Configuration Interaction (TD CI)\napproach for the molecule, the metal NP is described as a continuous dielectric\nof complex shape characterized by a Drude-Lorentz dielectric function and the\nmolecule- NP electromagnetic coupling is treated by an equation-of-motion (EOM)\nextension of the quasi-static Boundary Element Method (BEM). The model includes\nthe effects of both the mutual molecule- NP time-dependent polarization and the\nmodification of the probing electromagnetic field due to the plasmonic\nresonances of the NP. Finally, such an approach is applied to the investigation\nof the light absorption of a model chromophore, LiCN, in the presence of a\nmetal NP of complex shape.\n", "  We consider the TeV scale left-right symmetric theory which can accommodate\nlow scale seesaw mechanisms consistent with neutrino oscillation data and find\nnew physics contributions to neutrinoless double beta decay. The model\nfacilitates natural type-II seesaw dominance and the presence of extra\nparticles make the Dirac neutrino mass matrix $M_D$ large that leads to large\nlight heavy neutrino mixing. The spontaneous symmetry breaking through\ndoublets, triplets and bidoublet scalars at TeV scale offers rich phenomenology\naccessible to LHC. From the numerical studies of the new physics contributions\nto neutrinoless double beta decay we derive a lower limit on absolute scale of\nlightest neutrino mass and find that normal hierarchy (NH) pattern is favorable\ntaking into account the cosmology and oscillation data.\n", "  The quantities $\\epsilon_K^\\prime$ and $\\epsilon_K$ measure the amount of\ndirect and indirect CP violation in $K\\to \\pi\\pi$ decays, respectively. Using\nthe recent lattice results from the RBC and UKQCD Collaborations and a new\ncompact implementation of the $\\Delta S=1$ renormalization group evolution we\npredict $ \\mbox{Re}\\, \\frac{\\epsilon_{K}'}{\\epsilon_{K}} = \\left(1.06 \\pm 5.07\n\\right) \\times 10^{-4}$ in the Standard Model. This value is $2.8\\,\\sigma$\nbelow the experimental value of $ \\mbox{Re}\\,\n\\frac{\\epsilon_{K}'}{\\epsilon_{K}} = \\left(16.6 \\pm 2.3 \\right) \\times\n10^{-4}.$ In generic models of new physics the well-understood $\\epsilon_K$\nprecludes large contributions to $\\epsilon_K^\\prime$, if the new contributions\nenter at loop level. However, one can resolve the tension in\n$\\epsilon_{K}'/\\epsilon_{K}$ within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.\nTo this end two features of supersymmetry are crucial: First, one can have\nlarge isospin-breaking contributions (involving the strong instead of the weak\ninteraction) which enhance $\\epsilon_K^\\prime$. Second, the Majorana nature of\ngluinos permits a suppression of the MSSM contribution to $\\epsilon_K$, because\ntwo box diagrams interfere destructively.\n", "  We study fluctuations of linear statistics in Polyanalytic Ginibre ensembles,\na family of point processes describing planar free fermions in a uniform\nmagnetic field at higher Landau levels. Our main result is asymptotic normality\nof fluctuations, extending a result of Rider and Vir\\'ag. As in the analytic\ncase, the variance is composed of independent terms from the bulk and the\nboundary. Our methods rely on a structural formula for polyanalytic polynomial\nBergman kernels which separates out the different pure $q$-analytic kernels\ncorresponding to different Landau levels. The fluctuations with respect to\nthese pure $q$-analytic Ginibre ensembles are also studied, and a central limit\ntheorem is proved. The results suggest a stabilizing effect on the variance\nwhen the different Landau levels are combined together.\n", "  Wilson flow is an effective tool for constructing renormalized composite\noperators. We explore use of the Wilson flow to construct renormalized order\nparameters for the deconfinement transition in SU(3) gauge theory. We discuss\nrenormalization of the Polyakov loop, and of gluon condensates.\n", "  Hard processes in high-energy proton-nucleus collisions are a powerful tool\nin order to investigate several importants aspects of QCD in a nuclear medium,\nsuch as nuclear shadowing, parton multiple scattering or medium-induced gluon\nradiation. I review in these proceedings recent progress in that field.\n", "  An alternative, scalar theory of gravitation has been proposed, based on a\nmechanism/interpretation of gravity as being a pressure force: Archimedes'\nthrust. In it, the gravitational field affects the physical standards of space\nand time, but motion is governed by an extension of the relativistic form of\nNewton's second law. This implies Einstein's geodesic motion for free particles\nonly in a constant gravitational field. In this work, equations governing the\ndynamics of a continuous medium subjected to gravitational and\nnon-gravitational forces are derived. Then, the case where the\nnon-gravitational force is the Lorentz force is investigated. The gravitational\nmodification of Maxwell's equations is obtained under the requirement that a\ncharged continuous medium, subjected to the Lorentz force, obeys the equation\nderived for continuum dynamics under external forces. These Maxwell equations\nare shown to be consistent with the dynamics of a \"free\" photon, and thus with\nthe geometrical optics of this theory. However, these equations do not imply\nlocal charge conservation, except for a constant gravitational field.\n  Keywords: Alternative theories of gravitation; preferred reference frame;\ncurved spacetime; Maxwell equations; charge conservation\n", "  We describe the center of the ring $\\Diff(n)$ of $\\h$-deformed differential\noperators of type A. We establish an isomorphism between certain localizations\nof $\\Diff(n)$ and the Weyl algebra $\\text{W}_n$ extended by $n$ indeterminates.\n", "  Important observational results have been recently reported on the angular\ndistributions of cosmic rays (CRs) at all energies, calling into question the\nperception of CRs a decade ago. These results together with their in-progress\ninterpretations are summarized in this short overview paper, following the\ncontribution presented at the XXV European Cosmic Ray Symposium.\n", "  We study the defect dynamics in a colloidal spin ice system realized by\nfilling a square lattice of topographic double well islands with repulsively\ninteracting magnetic colloids. We focus on the contraction of defects in the\nground state, and contraction/expansion in a metastable biased state. Combining\nreal-time experiments with simulations, we prove that these defects behave like\nemergent topological monopoles obeying a Coulomb law with an additional line\ntension. We further show how to realize a completely resettable \"NOR\" gate,\nwhich provides guidelines for fabrication of nanoscale logic devices based on\nthe motion of topological magnetic monopoles.\n", "  We present a calculation of the spectral properties of a single charge doped\nat a Cu($3d$) site of the Cu-F plane in KCuF$_{3}$. The problem is treated by\ngenerating the equations of motion for the Green's function by means of\nsubsequent Dyson expansions and solving the resulting set of equations. This\nmethod, dubbed the variational approximation, is both very dependable and\nflexible, since it is a systematic expansion with precise control over\nelementary physical processes. It allows for deep insight into the underlying\nphysics of polaron formation as well as for inclusion of many physical\nconstraints, such as excluding crossing diagrams and double occupation\nconstraint, which are not included in the Self-Consistent Born Approximation.\nHere we examine the role and importance of such constraints by analyzing\nvarious spectral functions obtained in second order VA.\n", "  We develop an $e_g$ orbital, $t$-$J$-like model of a single charge doped into\na two-dimensional plane with ferromagnetic spin order and alternating orbital\norder, and present its solution by Green's functions in the variational\napproximation framework. The model is designed to represent the orbital physics\nwithin ferromagnetic $(a,b)$ planes of KCuF$_3$ and K$_2$CuF$_4$. The\nvariational approximation (VA) relies on the systematic generation of equations\nof motion for the Green's function, taking into account the real-space\nconstraints coming from the exclusion of doubly occupied sites. This method is\ncompared to the firmly established self-consistent Born approximation, and to\nthe variational cluster approximation (VCA) which relies on the itinerant\nregime of the model. We find that the present variational approximation\ncaptures the essential aspects of the spectral weight distribution of the\ncoherent quasiparticle state and gives a result similar to the VCA, while also\nreproducing well the momentum dependence of the spectral moments. In contrast,\nthe spectral function obtained within the self-consistent Born approximation is\nmore incoherent and its quasiparticle is heavier, at strong effective\ncouplings, than observed with VCA and VA.\n", "  A general adsorption model is developed to describe the interactions between\nnear-wall fluid molecules and solid surface. This model serves as a framework\nfor the theoretical modelling of the boundary slip phenomena. Based on this\nadsorption model, a new general model for the slip velocity of fluids on solid\nsurfaces is introduced. The slip boundary condition at a fluid-solid interface\nhas hitherto been considered separately for gases and liquids. In this paper,\nwe show that the slip velocity in both gases and liquids may originate from\ndynamical adsorption processes at the interface. A unified analytical model\nthat is valid for both gas-solid and liquid-solid slip boundary conditions is\nproposed based on surface science theory. The corroboration with experimental\ndata extracted from the literature shows that the proposed model provides an\nimproved prediction compared to existing analytical models for gases at higher\nshear rates and close agreement for liquid-solid interfaces in general.\n", "  The problem presented involves the development of a new analytical model for\nthe general fluid-solid temperature jump. To the best of our knowledge, there\nare no analytical models that provide the accurate predictions of the\ntemperature jump for both gas and liquid systems. In this paper, a unified\nmodel for the fluid-solid temperature jump has been developed based on our\nadsorption model of the interfacial interactions. Results obtained from this\nmodel are validated with available results from the literature.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of spin and orbital order in undoped LaMnO$_3$\nunder increasing temperature with a model including both superexchange and\nJahn-Teller interactions. We used several cluster mean field calculation\nschemes and find coexisting $A$-type antiferromagnetic ($A$-AF) and $C$-type\nalternating orbital order at low temperature. The value of the Jahn-Teller\ncoupling between strongly correlated $e_g$ orbitals is estimated from the\norbital transition temperature at $T_{\\rm OO}\\simeq 780$ K. By a careful\nanalysis of on-site and on-bond correlations we demonstrate that spin-orbital\nentanglement is rather weak. We have verified that the magnetic transition\ntemperature is influenced by entangled spin-orbital operators as well as by\nentangled orbital operators on the bonds but the errors introduced by\ndecoupling such operators partly compensate each other. Altogether, these\nresults justify why the commonly used disentangled spin-orbital model is so\nsuccessful in describing the magnetic properties and the temperature dependence\nof the optical spectral weights for LaMnO$_3$.\n", "  This paper will design non-linear frequency modulation (NLFM) signal for\nChebyshev, Kaiser, Taylor, and raised-cosine power spectral densities (PSDs).\nThen, the variation of peak sidelobe level with regard to mainlobe width for\nthese four different window functions are analyzed. It has been demonstrated\nthat reduction of sidelobe level in NLFM signal can lead to increase in\nmainlobe width of autocorrelation function. Furthermore, the results of power\nspectral density obtained from the simulation and the desired PSD are compared.\nFinally, error percentage between simulated PSD and desired PSD for different\npeak sidelobe level are illustrated. The stationary phase concept is the\npossible source for this error.\n", "  Grazing incidence interferometry has been applied to rough planar and\ncylindrical surfaces. As suitable beam splitters diffractive optical phase\nelements are quite common because these allow for the same test sensitivity for\nall surface points. But a rotational-symmetric convex aspheric has two\ncurvatures which reduces the measurable region to a meridian through the vortex\nof the aspheric, which is in contrast to cylindrical surfaces having a\none-dimensional curvature which allows the test of the whole surface in gracing\nincidence. The meridional limitation for rotational-symmetric aspherics\nnevertheless offers the possibility to measure single meridians in a one-step\nmeasurement. An extension to the complete surface can be obtained by rotating\nthe aspheric around its vortex within the frame of the test interferometer.\n", "  The loss of particles due to highly inelastic reactions has previously been\ntaken into account in effective field theories for low-energy particles by\nadding local anti-Hermitian terms to the effective Hamiltonian. An additional\nmodification is required in the time evolution equation for the density matrix\nof a multi-particle system. An effective density matrix can be defined by\ntracing over states containing high-momentum particles produced by the highly\ninelastic reactions and by a time average that eliminates short-time\ncorrelations. The effective density matrix satisfies the Lindblad equation,\nwith local Lindblad operators that are determined by the anti-Hermitian terms\nin the effective Hamiltonian.\n", "  We aim to study the optical and near-infrared linear polarimetric properties\nof a sample of young M7-L7 dwarfs ($\\approx$1-500 Myr) with spectroscopic\nsignatures of low- and intermediate-gravity atmospheres. We collected optical\n($RIZ$) and near-infrared ($YJHK_{\\rm s}$) linear polarimetry images on various\ntime scales from $\\sim$0.2 h to months. Linear polarization degrees in the\ninterval 0-1.5\\% ($I$- and $J$-bands) were measured with accuracies ranging\nfrom $\\pm$0.1 $\\%$ to $\\pm$0.9 $\\%$ depending on the observing filter and the\ntarget brightness. We found that the young field dwarfs in our sample show\nsimilar polarimetric degrees at both $I$- and $J$-bands, and that there is no\nobvious trend with the spectral type. The two Taurus sources in our sample show\nintense levels of $J$-band linear polarization probably due to surrounding\ndisks. By compiling data from the literature for high-gravity M7-L7 dwarfs with\nlikely ages $\\ge$500 Myr, we did not observe any apparent difference in the\nlinear polarimetry intensity between the young and old samples that could be\nascribed to differing atmospheric gravities. Polarimetric variability with peak\nto peak amplitudes up to 1.5 $\\%$ is detected on scales of about a rotation in\ntwo out of four targets that were monitored over several hours. Long-term\npolarimetric variability is also detected in nearly all dwarfs of the sample\nwith data spanning months to years.\n", "  Achieving and controlling strong light-matter interactions in many-body\nsystems is of paramount importance both for fundamental understanding and\npotential applications. In this paper we demonstrate both experimentally and\ntheoretically how to manipulate strong coupling between the Bragg-plasmon mode\nsupported by a organo-metallic array and molecular excitons in the form of\nJ-aggregates dispersed on the hybrid structure. We observe experimentally the\ntransition from a conventional strong coupling regime exhibiting the usual\nupper and lower polaritonic branches to a more complex regime, where a third\nnondispersive mode is seen, as the concentration of J-aggregates is increased.\nThe numerical simulations confirm the presence of the third resonance. We\nattribute its physical nature to collective molecule-molecule interactions\nleading to the collective electromagnetic response. A simple analytical model\nis proposed to explain the physics of the third mode. The nonlinear dependence\non molecular parameters followed from the model are confirmed in a set of\nrigorous numerical studies. It is shown that at the energy of the collective\nmode molecules oscillate completely out of phase with the incident radiation\nacting as an effective thin metal layer.\n", "  Distribution networks -- from vasculature to urban transportation systems --\nare prevalent in both the natural and consumer worlds. These systems are\nintrinsically physical in composition and are embedded into real space,\nproperties that lead to constraints on their topological organization. In this\nstudy, we compare and contrast two types of biological distribution networks:\nmycelial fungi and the vasculature system on the surface of rodent brains. Both\nsystems are alike in that they must route resources efficiently, but they are\nalso inherently distinct in terms of their growth mechanisms, and in that fungi\nare not attached to a larger organism and must often function in unregulated\nand varied environments. We begin by uncovering a common organizational\nprinciple -- Rentian scaling -- that manifests as hierarchical network layout\nin both physical and topological space. Simulated models of distribution\nnetworks optimized for transport in the presence of fluctuations are also shown\nto exhibit this feature in their embedding, with similar scaling exponents.\nHowever, we also find clear differences in how the fungi and vasculature\nbalance tradeoffs in material cost, efficiency, and robustness. While the\nvasculature appear well optimized for low cost, but relatively high efficiency,\nthe fungi tend to form more expensive but in turn more robust networks. These\ndifferences may be driven by the distinct functions that each system must\nperform, and the different habitats in which they reside. As a whole, this work\ndemonstrates that distribution networks contain a set of common, emergent\ndesign features, as well as tailored optimizations.\n", "  Neuroengineering is faced with unique challenges in repairing or replacing\ncomplex neural systems that are composed of many interacting parts. These\ninteractions form intricate patterns over large spatiotemporal scales, and\nproduce emergent behaviors that are difficult to predict from individual\nelements. Network science provides a particularly appropriate framework in\nwhich to study and intervene in such systems, by treating neural elements\n(cells, volumes) as nodes in a graph and neural interactions (synapses, white\nmatter tracts) as edges in that graph. Here, we review the emerging discipline\nof network neuroscience, which uses and develops tools from graph theory to\nbetter understand and manipulate neural systems, from micro- to macroscales. We\npresent examples of how human brain imaging data is being modeled with network\nanalysis and underscore potential pitfalls. We then highlight current\ncomputational and theoretical frontiers, and emphasize their utility in\ninforming diagnosis and monitoring, brain-machine interfaces, and brain\nstimulation. A flexible and rapidly evolving enterprise, network neuroscience\nprovides a set of powerful approaches and fundamental insights critical to the\nneuroengineer's toolkit.\n", "  The $S$-duality group $\\mathbb{S}(\\mathcal{F})$ of a 4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$\nsupersymmetric theory $\\mathcal{F}$ is identified with the group of triangle\nauto-equivalences of its cluster category $\\mathscr{C}(\\mathcal{F})$ modulo the\nsubgroup acting trivially on the physical quantities. $\\mathbb{S}(\\mathcal{F})$\nis a discrete group commensurable to a subgroup of the Siegel modular group\n$Sp(2g,\\mathbb{Z})$ ($g$ being the dimension of the Coulomb branch). This\nidentification reduces the determination of the $S$-duality group of a given\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ theory to a problem in homological algebra. In this paper we\ndescribe the techniques which make the computation straightforward for a large\nclass of $\\mathcal{N}=2$ QFTs. The group $\\mathbb{S}(\\mathcal{F})$ is naturally\npresented as a generalized braid group.\n  The $S$-duality groups are often larger than expected. In some models the\nenhancement of $S$-duality is quite spectacular. For instance, a QFT with a\nhuge $S$-duality group is the Lagrangian SCFT with gauge group $SO(8)\\times\nSO(5)^3\\times SO(3)^6$ and half-hypermultiplets in the bi- and tri-spinor\nrepresentations.\n  We focus on four families of examples: the $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs of the form\n$(G,G^\\prime)$, $D_p(G)$, and $E_r^{(1,1)}(G)$, as well as the\nasymptotically-free theories $(G,\\widehat{H})$ (which contain $\\mathcal{N}=2$\nSQCD as a special case). For the $E_r^{(1,1)}(G)$ models we confirm the\npresence of the $PSL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ $S$-duality group predicted by Del Zotto,\nVafa and Xie, but for most models in this class $S$-duality gets enhanced to a\nmuch larger group.\n", "  We present recent results obtained by the KLOE-2 Collaboration at the DAPHNE\ne+e- collider. The first class of results concerns search for dark forces at\nthe scale of 1 GeV in associated production of gamma and the U boson, in search\nfor the Higgsstrahlung and in possible decays of phi into eta and U. The second\nis in neutral kaon physics, on testing the CPT and Lorentz invariance, and on\nsearch for quantum decoherence effects in entangled pairs of kaons. The third\nclass of results concerns precision measurements in hadronic physics at low\nenergy where transition form factors of phi to pseudoscalar mesons pi0 and eta\nare determined.\n", "  Understanding material behavior under high velocity impact is the key to\naddressing a variety of fundamental questions in areas ranging from asteroid\nstrikes and geological cratering to impact-induced phase transformations,\nspallation, wear, and ballistic penetration. Recently, adhesion has emerged in\nthis spectrum since it has been found that micrometer-sized metallic particles\ncan bond to metallic substrates under supersonic-impact conditions. However,\nthe mechanistic aspects of impact-induced adhesion are still unresolved. Here\nwe study supersonic impact of individual metallic microparticles on substrates\nwith micro-scale and nanosecond-level resolution. This permits the first direct\nobservation of a material-dependent threshold velocity, above which the\nparticle undergoes impact-induced material ejection and adheres to the\nsubstrate. Our finite element simulations reveal that prevailing theories of\nimpact-induced shear localization and melting cannot account for the material\nejection. Rather, it originates from the propagation of a pressure wave induced\nupon impact. The experiments and simulations together establish that the\ncritical adhesion velocity for supersonic microparticles is proportional to the\nbulk speed of sound.\n", "  Gene expression levels carry information about signals that have functional\nsignificance for the organism. Using the gap gene network in the fruit fly\nembryo as an example, we show how this information can be decoded, building a\ndictionary that translates expression levels into a map of implied positions.\nThe optimal decoder makes use of graded variations in absolute expression\nlevel, resulting in positional estimates that are precise to ~1% of the\nembryo's length. We test this optimal decoder by analyzing gap gene expression\nin embryos lacking some of the primary maternal inputs to the network. The\nresulting maps are distorted, and these distortions predict, with no free\nparameters, the positions of expression stripes for the pair-rule genes in the\nmutant embryos.\n"]}
