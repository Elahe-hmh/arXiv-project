"10.1007/3-540-40988-2_14"], "abstract": ["  (abriged) MRI turbulence is a leading mechanism for the generation of an\nefficient turbulent transport of angular momentum in an accretion disk through\na turbulent viscosity effect. It is believed that the same process could also\ntransport large-scale magnetic fields in disks, reshaping the magnetic\nstructures in these objects. This process, known as turbulent resistivity, has\nbeen suggested and used in several accretion-ejection models and simulations to\nproduce jets. Still, the efficiency of MRI-driven turbulence to transport\nlarge-scale magnetic fields is largely unknown.\n  We investigate this problem both analytically and numerically. We introduce a\nlinear calculation of the MRI in the presence of a spatially inhomogeneous mean\nmagnetic field. We show that, in this configuration, MRI modes lead to an\nefficient magnetic field transport, on the order of the angular momentum\ntransport. We next use fully non linear simulations of MRI turbulence to\ncompute the turbulent resistivity in several magnetic configurations.\n  We find that the turbulent resistivity is on the order of the turbulent\nviscosity in all our simulations, although somewhat lower. The turbulent\nresistivity tensor is found to be highly anisotropic with a diffusion\ncoefficient 3 times greater in the radial direction than in the vertical\ndirection.\n  These results support the possibility of driving jets from turbulent disks;\nthe resulting jets may not be steady.\n", "  Deviations from axial symmetry are necessary to maintain self-sustained\nMRI-turbulence. We define the parameters region where nonaxisymmetric MRI is\nexcited and study dependence of the unstable modes structure and growth rates\non the relevant parameters. We solve numerically the linear eigenvalue problem\nfor global axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric modes of standard-MRI in Keplerian\ndisks with finite diffusion. For small magnetic Prandtl number the microscopic\nviscosity completely drops out from the analysis so that the stability maps and\nthe growth rates expressed in terms of the magnetic Reynolds number Rm and the\nLundquist number S do not depend on the magnetic Prandtl number Pm. The minimum\nmagnetic field for onset of nonaxisymmetric MRI grows with Rm. For given S all\nnonaxisymmetric modes disappear for sufficiently high Rm. This behavior is a\nconsequence of the radial fine-structure of the nonaxisymmetric modes resulting\nfrom the winding effect of differential rotation. It is this fine-structure\nwhich presents severe resolution problems for the numerical simulation of MRI\nat large Rm. For weak supercritical magnetic fields only axisymmetric modes are\nunstable. Nonaxisymmetric modes need stronger fields and not too fast rotation.\nIf Pm is small its real value does not play any role in MRI.\n", "  A classification of leptonic currents with respect to C-operation requires\nthe separation of elementary particles into the two classes of vector C-even\nand axial-vector C-odd character. Their nature has been created so that to each\ntype of lepton corresponds a kind of neutrino. Such pairs are united in\nfamilies of a different C-parity. Unlike the neutrino of a vector type, any\nC-noninvariant Dirac neutrino must have his Majorana neutrino. They constitute\nthe purely neutrino families. We discuss the nature of a corresponding\nmechanism responsible for the availability in all types of axial-vector\nparticles of a kind of flavour which distinguishes each of them from others by\na true charge characterized by a quantum number conserved at the interactions\nbetween the C-odd fermion and the field of emission of the corresponding types\nof gauge bosons. This regularity expresses the unidenticality of truly neutral\nneutrino and antineutrino, confirming that an internal symmetry of a\nC-noninvariant particle is described by an axial-vector space. Thereby, a true\nflavour together with the earlier known lepton flavour predicts the existence\nof leptonic strings and their birth in single and double beta decays as a unity\nof flavour and gauge symmetry laws. Such a unified principle explains the\navailability of a flavour symmetrical mode of neutrino oscillations.\n", "  This letter investigates the transport properties of MHD turbulence induced\nby the magnetorotational instability at large Reynolds numbers Re when the\nmagnetic Prandtl number Pm is larger than unity. Three MHD simulations of the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI) in the unstratified shearing box with zero\nnet flux are presented. These simulations are performed with the code Zeus and\nconsider the evolution of the rate of angular momentum transport as Re is\ngradually increased from 3125 to 12500 while simultaneously keeping Pm=4. To\nensure that the small scale features of the flow are well resolved, the\nresolution varies from 128 cells per disk scaleheight to 512 cells per\nscaleheight. The latter constitutes the highest resolution of an MRI turbulence\nsimulation to date. The rate of angular momentum transport, measured using the\nalpha parameter, depends only very weakly on the Reynolds number: alpha is\nfound to be about 0.007 with variations around this mean value bounded by 15%\nin all simulations. There is no systematic evolution with Re. For the best\nresolved model, the kinetic energy power spectrum tentatively displays a\npower-law range with an exponent -3/2, while the magnetic energy is found to\nshift to smaller and smaller scales as the magnetic Reynolds number increases.\nA couple of different diagnostics both suggest a well-defined injection length\nof a fraction of a scaleheight. The results presented in this letter are\nconsistent with the MRI being able to transport angular momentum efficiently at\nlarge Reynolds numbers when Pm=4 in unstratified zero net flux shearing boxes.\n", "  The generalized second law can be used to prove a singularity theorem, by\ngeneralizing the notion of a trapped surface to quantum situations. Like\nPenrose's original singularity theorem, it implies that spacetime is null\ngeodesically incomplete inside black holes, and to the past of spatially\ninfinite Friedmann--Robertson--Walker cosmologies. If space is finite instead,\nthe generalized second law requires that there only be a finite amount of\nentropy producing processes in the past, unless there is a reversal of the\narrow of time. In asymptotically flat spacetime, the generalized second law\nalso rules out traversable wormholes, negative masses, and other forms of\nfaster-than-light travel between asymptotic regions, as well as closed timelike\ncurves. Furthermore it is impossible to form baby universes which eventually\nbecome independent of the mother universe, or to restart inflation. Since the\nsemiclassical approximation is used only in regions with low curvature, it is\nargued that the results may hold in full quantum gravity. An introductory\nsection describes the second law and its time-reverse, in ordinary and\ngeneralized thermodynamics, using either the fine-grained or the coarse-grained\nentropy. (The fine-grained version is used in all results except those relating\nto the arrow of time.) A proof of the coarse-grained ordinary second law is\ngiven.\n", "  During detailed searches for new Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) in the\nAnglo Australian Observatory/United Kingdom Schmidt Telescope (AAO/UKST) HAlpha\nsurvey of the southern Galactic plane, we also uncovered, for the first time,\npossible associated HAlpha emission in the vicinity of about 24 known Galactic\nSNRs previously known solely from radio or X-ray observations.The possible\noptical counterparts to these known SNR were detected due to the 1 arcsecond\nresolution and 5 Rayleigh sensitivity of this HAlpha survey.\n  The newly discovered emission frequently exhibits the typical filamentary\nform of other optically detected SNRs although sometimes the HAlpha emission\nclouds or fragmented filaments largely inside an SNR extend over the radio\nborder. It is true that superposition of general diffuse and extended Galactic\nemission in the region of these remnants is a complicating factor, but for many\noptical candidates the HAlpha emission provides an excellent morphological and\npositional match to the observed radio emission so that an association seems\nclear.\n  We have already published HAlpha images and confirmatory spectral\nobservations for several of the best optical counterparts to known SNRs but for\ncompleteness and convenience we include them in our complete catalogue of\npreviously known radio detected SNRs for which we have now uncovered HAlpha\noptical emission. For better visualisation of the optical emissions from these\nfaint supernova remnants and to enhance some low surface-brightness features we\nalso present quotient images of the HAlpha data divided by the accompanying\nbroad-band short red (SR) data. Out of 274 Galactic SNRs currently catalogued\nand detected in the radio only ~20 had previous optical counterparts. We may\nhave now increased this by a further third by adding a further 24 candidate\noptical counterparts.\n", "  The colored HOMFLY polynomials, which describe Wilson loop averages in\nChern-Simons theory, possess an especially simple representation for torus\nknots, which begins from quantum R-matrix and ends up with a trivially-looking\nsplit W representation familiar from character calculus applications to matrix\nmodels and Hurwitz theory. Substitution of MacDonald polynomials for characters\nin these formulas provides a very simple description of \"superpolynomials\",\nmuch simpler than the recently studied alternative which deforms relation to\nthe WZNW theory and explicitly involves the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.\nA lot of explicit expressions are presented for different representations\n(Young diagrams), many of them new. In particular, we provide the\nsuperpolynomial P_[1]^[m,km\\pm 1] for arbitrary m and k. The procedure is not\nrestricted to the fundamental (all antisymmetric) representations and the torus\nknots, still in these cases some subtleties persist.\n", "  We use the classical correlation between a quantum system being measured and\nits measurement apparatus to analyze the amount of information being retrieved\nin a quantum measurement process. Accounting for decoherence of the apparatus,\nwe show that these correlations may have a sudden transition from a decay\nregime to a constant level. This transition characterizes a non-asymptotic\nemergence of the pointer basis, while the system-apparatus can still be quantum\ncorrelated. We provide a formalization of the concept of emergence of a pointer\nbasis in an apparatus subject to decoherence. This contrast of the pointer\nbasis emergence to the quantum to classical transition is demonstrated in an\nexperiment with polarization entangled photon pairs.\n", "  Deterministic chaotic dynamics presumes that the state space can be\npartitioned arbitrarily finely. In a physical system, the inevitable presence\nof some noise sets a finite limit to the finest possible resolution that can be\nattained. Much previous research deals with what this attainable resolution\nmight be, all of it based on global averages over a stochastic flow. We show\nhow to compute the locally optimal partition, for a given dynamical system and\ngiven noise, in terms of local eigenfunctions of the Fokker-Planck operator and\nits adjoint. We first analyze the interplay of the deterministic dynamics with\nthe noise in the neighborhood of a periodic orbit of a map, by using a\ndiscretized version of Fokker-Planck formalism. Then we propose a method to\ndetermine the 'optimal resolution' of the state space, based on solving\nFokker-Planck's equation locally, on sets of unstable periodic orbits of the\ndeterministic system. We test our hypothesis on unimodal maps.\n", "  This perspective chapter briefly surveys: (1) past growth in the use of\nBayesian methods in astrophysics; (2) current misconceptions about both\nfrequentist and Bayesian statistical inference that hinder wider adoption of\nBayesian methods by astronomers; and (3) multilevel (hierarchical) Bayesian\nmodeling as a major future direction for research in Bayesian astrostatistics,\nexemplified in part by presentations at the first ISI invited session on\nastrostatistics, commemorated in this volume. It closes with an intentionally\nprovocative recommendation for astronomical survey data reporting, motivated by\nthe multilevel Bayesian perspective on modeling cosmic populations: that\nastronomers cease producing catalogs of estimated fluxes and other source\nproperties from surveys. Instead, summaries of likelihood functions (or\nmarginal likelihood functions) for source properties should be reported (not\nposterior probability density functions), including nontrivial summaries (not\nsimply upper limits) for candidate objects that do not pass traditional\ndetection thresholds.\n", "  We introduce Bayesian Estimation Applied to Multiple Species (BEAMS), an\nalgorithm designed to deal with parameter estimation when using contaminated\ndata. We present the algorithm and demonstrate how it works with the help of a\nGaussian simulation. We then apply it to supernova data from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS), showing how the resulting confidence contours of the\ncosmological parameters shrink significantly.\n", "  The covariant holographic entropy conjecture of AdS/CFT relates the entropy\nof a boundary region R to the area of an extremal surface in the bulk\nspacetime. This extremal surface can be obtained by a maximin construction,\nallowing many new results to be proven. On manifolds obeying the null curvature\ncondition, these extremal surfaces: i) always lie outside the causal wedge of\nR, ii) have less area than the bifurcation surface of the causal wedge, iii)\nmove away from the boundary as R grows, and iv) obey strong subadditivity and\nmonogamy of mutual information. These results suggest that the information in R\nallows the bulk to be reconstructed all the way up to the extremal area\nsurface. The maximin surfaces are shown to exist on spacetimes without\nhorizons, and on black hole spacetimes with Kasner-like singularities.\n", "  Weak noise smooths out fractals in a chaotic state space and introduces a\nmaximum attainable resolution to its structure. The balance of noise and\ndeterministic stretching/contraction in each neighborhood introduces local\ninvariants of the dynamics that can be used to partition the state space. We\nstudy the local discrete-time evolution of a density in a two-dimensional\nhyperbolic state space, and use the asymptotic eigenfunctions for the noisy\ndynamics to formulate a new state space partition algorithm.\n", "  We show from a bond valence sum correlation that very high superconducting $\nT_{c} $ values should be found in optimally hole-doped infinite-layer ACuO$\n_{2} $ cuprates - up to 160~K for A = Ba. The projected increase in $ T_{c} $\nacross the series arises from \"internal pressure\" effects as A runs from Mg to\nBa. We then use density functional theory to investigate these pressure effects\non the band structure in an attempt to understand this progressive increase in\n$ T_{c} $. Where these materials have been synthesised we find good agreement\nbetween our calculated structural parameters and the experimental ones. We find\nthat internal pressure associated with increasing ion size does indeed enhance\nthe superconducting energy gap, as observed, via modifications to the\nelectronic dispersion. Furthermore, in our calculations, pressure alters the\ndispersion independently of how it is applied (internal or external) so that\nthe superconducting energy gap correlates with the unit-cell volume and a\nFermi-surface shape-parameter describing ratio of next-nearest-neighbor to\nnearest-neighbor hopping integrals. We infer an energy scale for the pairing\ninteraction of the order of 1~eV, well above the magnetic energy scale.\n", "  The effect of a Kerr nonlinearity on dynamical tunneling is studied, using\ncoupled whispering gallery modes in an optical microcavity. The model system\nthat we have chosen is the 'add-drop filter', which comprises an optical\nmicrocavity and two waveguide coupled to the cavity. Due to the evanescent\nfield's scattering on the waveguide, the whispering gallery modes in the\nmicrocavity form doublets, which manifest themselves as splittings in the\nspectrum. As these doublets can be regarded as a spectral feature of dynamical\ntunneling between two different dynamical states with a spatial overlap, the\neffect of a Kerr nonlinearity on the doublets is numerically investigated in\nthe more general context of the relationship between cubic nonlinearity and\ndynamical tunneling. Within the numerical realization of the model system, it\nis observed that the doublets shows a bistable transition in its transmission\ncurve as the Kerr-nonlinearity in the cavity is increased. At the same time,\none rotational mode gets dominant over the other one in the transmission, since\nthe two states in the doublet have uneven linewidths. By using coupled mode\ntheory, the underlying mode dynamics of the phenomena is theoretically modelled\nand clarified.\n", "  In recent years, it has become possible to detect individual dark matter\nsubhalos near images of strongly lensed extended background galaxies.\nTypically, only the most massive subhalos in the strong lensing region may be\ndetected this way. In this work, we show that strong lenses may also be used to\nconstrain the much more numerous population of lower mass subhalos that are too\nsmall to be detected individually. In particular, we show that the power\nspectrum of projected density fluctuations in galaxy halos can be measured\nusing strong gravitational lensing. We develop the mathematical framework of\npower spectrum estimation, and test our method on mock observations. We use our\nresults to determine the types of observations required to measure the\nsubstructure power spectrum with high significance. We predict that deep\nobservations ($\\sim10$ hours on a single target) with current facilities can\nmeasure this power spectrum at the $3\\sigma$ level, with no apparent degeneracy\nwith unknown clumpiness in the background source structure or fluctuations from\ndetector noise. Upcoming ALMA measurements of strong lenses are capable of\nplacing strong constraints on the abundance of dark matter subhalos and the\nunderlying particle nature of dark matter.\n", "  Current social and activist movements find the opportunity in social media to\neffectively impact on the agenda of governing bodies and create `global'\nperceptions -- it is often claimed.

The aim of this explorative study is\nto assess whether the temporal evolution of the Normalised Web Distance (NWD)\n--as defined by Cilibrasi & Vit\\'anyi (2007)-- between identifying terms\nconcerning this activism could be used to measure the progress or decline of\nsocial empowerment through the Internet. The NWD relies on the page count\nnumber of single and joint queries, which in our study have been registered\nusing a freely available web browser (e.g. Google Search) providing a time\nsearch window for temporal query results. To explore this meta-data technique,\nwe introduce the case of a perceived Wirikuta online movement, which originated\nin Mexico with the aim to protect the Huichols' sacred land and water resources\nfrom open mining projects for silver ore. We conducted a small scale Internet\nstudy relating the key terms `Wirikuta', `Huichol', and `Wixarika' and their\nco-occurrence with seven positive qualifiers (e.g. `sacred land'), five\nnegative qualifiers (e.g. `violence') and one neutral qualifier (`table') over\ntime, annually from 1994 till 2013. We confirm close semantic clustering over\ntime of traditional indigeneous identity terms of the Huichol, and observe a\nslight convergence of key terms to `mines' and less pronounced to `sacred land'\nand a divergence with respect to `ancestors' indicating a complex image of a\ntendency of empowerment.\n", "  We study fusion kernel for non-degenerate conformal blocks in Liouville\ntheory as a solution to the difference equations originating from the pentagon\nidentity. We suggest an approach to these equations based on 'non-perturbative'\nseries expansion which allows to calculate the fusion kernel iteratively. We\nalso find the exact solutions for the cases when the central charge is\n$c=1+6(b-b^{-1})^2$ and $b~\\in \\mathbb{N}$. For $c = 1$ our result reproduces\nthe formula, obtained earlier from analytical continuation via Painlev\\'e\nequation. However, in our case it appears in a significantly simplified form.\n", "  In this article, we show that the block size distribution function in the\nweighted planar stochastic lattice (WPSL), which is a multifractal and whose\ndual is a scale-free network, exhibits dynamic scaling. We verify it\nnumerically using the idea of data-collapse. As the WPSL is a space-filling\ncellular structure, we thought it was worth checking if the Lewis and the\nAboav-Weaire laws are obeyed in the WPSL. To this end, we find that the mean\narea $<A>_k$ of blocks with $k$ neighbours grow linearly up to $k=8$, and hence\nthe Lewis law is obeyed. However, beyond $k>8$ we find that $<A>_k$ grows\nexponentially to a constant value violating the Lewis law. On the other hand,\nwe show that the Aboav-Weaire law is violated for the entire range of $k$.\nInstead, we find that the mean number of neighbours of a block adjacent to a\nblock with\n  $k$ neighbours is approximately equal to six, independent of $k$.\n", "  We have developed a new method to approach the missing baryons problem. We\nassume that the missing baryons reside in a form of Warm Hot Intergalactic\nMedium, i.e. the WHIM. Our method consists of (a) detecting the coherent large\nscale structure in the spatial distribution of galaxies that traces the Cosmic\nWeb and that in hydrodynamical simulations is associated to the WHIM, (b) map\nits luminosity into a galaxy luminosity density field, (c) use numerical\nsimulations to relate the luminosity density to the density of the WHIM, (d)\napply this relation to real data to trace the WHIM using the observed galaxy\nluminosities in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 2dF redshift surveys. In our\napplication we find evidence for the WHIM along the line of sight to the\nSculptor Wall, at redshifts consistent with the recently reported X-ray\nabsorption line detections. Our indirect WHIM detection technique complements\nthe standard method based on the detection of characteristic X-ray absorption\nlines, showing that the galaxy luminosity density is a reliable signpost for\nthe WHIM. For this reason, our method could be applied to current galaxy\nsurveys to optimise the observational strategies for detecting and studying the\nWHIM and its properties. Our estimates of the WHIM hydrogen column density in\nSculptor agree with those obtained via the X-ray analysis. Due to the\nadditional column density estimate, our method has potential for improving the\nconstrains of the physical parameters of the WHIM as derived with X-ray\nabsorption, and thus for improving the understanding of the missing baryons\nproblem.\n", "  We comment upon a numerical computation in a recent paper by Balasubramanian,\nBuchel, Green, Lehner, and Liebling.\n", "  Unruh effect is a landmark prediction of standard quantum field theory in\nwhich Fock vacuum state appears as a thermal state with respect to an uniformly\naccelerating observer. Given its dependence on trans-Planckian modes, Unruh\neffect is often considered as an arena for exploring a candidate theory of\nquantum gravity. Here we show that Unruh effect disappears if, instead of using\nFock quantization, one uses polymer quantization or loop quantization, the\nquantization method used in loop quantum gravity. Secondly, the polymer vacuum\nstate remains a vacuum state even for the accelerating observer in the sense\nthat expectation value of number density operator in it remains zero. Finally,\nif experimental measurement of Unruh effect is ever possible then it may be\nused either to verify or rule out a theory of quantum gravity.\n", "  We calculate the transport properties of three-dimensional Weyl fermions in a\ndisordered environment. The resulting conductivity depends only on the Fermi\nenergy and the scattering rate. First we study the conductivity at the spectral\nnode for a fixed scattering rate and obtain a continuous transition from an\ninsulator at weak disorder to a metal at stronger disorder. In the\nself-consistent Born approximation the scattering rate depends on the Fermi\nenergy. Then it is crucial that the limits of the conductivity for a vanishing\nFermi energy and a vanishing scattering rate do not commute. As a result, there\nis also metallic behavior in the phase with vanishing scattering rate and only\na quantum critical point remains as an insulating state.\n", "  We study, both theoretically and experimentally, the dynamical polarizability\n$\\alpha(\\omega)$ of $\\textrm{Rb}_2$ molecules in the rovibrational ground state\nof $\\mathrm{a}^3\\Sigma_u^+$. Taking all relevant excited molecular bound states\ninto account, we compute the complex-valued polarizability $\\alpha(\\omega)$ for\nwave numbers up to $20000\\:\\textrm{cm}^{-1}$. Our calculations are compared to\nexperimental results at $1064.5\\:\\textrm{nm}$ ($\\sim9400\\:\\textrm{cm}^{-1}$) as\nwell as at $830.4\\:\\textrm{nm}$ ($\\sim12000\\:\\textrm{cm}^{-1}$). Here, we\ndiscuss the measurements at $1064.5\\:\\textrm{nm}$. The ultracold\n$\\textrm{Rb}_2$ molecules are trapped in the lowest Bloch band of a 3D optical\nlattice. Their polarizability is determined by lattice modulation spectroscopy\nwhich measures the potential depth for a given light intensity. Moreover, we\ninvestigate the decay of molecules in the optical lattice, where lifetimes of\nmore than $2\\:\\textrm{s}$ are observed. In addition, the dynamical\npolarizability for the $\\mathrm{X}^1\\Sigma_g^+$ state is calculated. We provide\nsimple analytical expressions that reproduce the numerical results for\n$\\alpha(\\omega)$ for all vibrational levels of $\\mathrm{a}^3\\Sigma_u^+$ as well\nas $\\mathrm{X}^1\\Sigma_g^+$. Precise knowledge of the molecular polarizability\nis essential for designing experiments with ultracold molecules as lifetimes\nand lattice depths are key parameters. Specifically the wavelength at\n$\\sim1064\\:\\textrm{nm}$ is of interest, since here, ultrastable high power\nlasers are available.\n", "  We analyse the concentration of solid particles in vortices created and\nsustained by radial buoyancy in protoplanetary disks, i.e. baroclinic vortex\ngrowth. Besides the gas drag acting on particles we also allow for\nback-reaction from dust onto the gas. This becomes important when the local\ndust-to-gas ratio approaches unity. In our 2D, local, shearing sheet\nsimulations we see high concentrations of grains inside the vortices for a\nbroad range of Stokes numbers, ${\\rm St}$. An initial dust-to-gas ratio of\n1:100 can easily be reversed to 100:1 for ${\\rm St}=1$. The increased\ndust-to-gas ratio triggers the streaming instability, thus counter-intuitively\nlimiting the maximal achievable overdensities. We find that particle trapping\ninside vortices opens the possibility for gravity-assisted planetesimal\nformation even for small particles ($\\rm{St}=0.01$) and low initial dust-to-gas\nratios (1:$10^4$)\n", "  We report evidence for the existence of a supercurrent of magnons in a magnon\nBose-Einstein condensate prepared in a room temperature yttrium-iron-garnet\nmagnetic film and subject to a thermal gradient. The magnon condensate is\nformed in a parametrically populated magnon gas, and its temporal evolution is\nstudied by time-, frequency- and wavector-resolved Brillouin light scattering\nspectroscopy. It has been found that local heating in the focal point of a\nprobing laser beam enhances the temporal decrease in the density of the freely\nevolving magnon condensate after the termination of the pumping pulse, but it\ndoes not alter the relaxation dynamics of the gaseous magnon phase. This\nphenomenon is understood as the appearance of a magnon supercurrent within the\ncondensate due to a temperature- and, consequently, magnetisation-gradient\ninduced phase gradient in the condensate wave function.\n", "  Models beyond the Standard Model with extra scalars have been highly\nmotivated by the recent discovery of a Higgs boson. The Two Higgs Doublet Model\nType III considers the most general case for the scalar potential, allowing\nmixing between neutral CP-even and CP-odd scalar fields. This work presents the\nresults of the study on the $t\\rightarrow c\\gamma$ decay at one loop level if\nneutral flavor changing is generated by top-charm-Higgs coupling given by the\nYukawa matrix. For instance, a value for the branching ratio $Br(t\\rightarrow\nc\\gamma)\\sim 10^{-6}$ for $\\tan\\beta=2.5$ and general neutral Higgs mixing\nparameters, $1.16\\leq\\alpha_1\\leq1.5$, $-0.48\\leq\\alpha_2\\leq-0.1$. The number\nof events for the $t\\rightarrow c \\gamma$ decay with an integrated luminosity\nof 300 $fb^{-1}$ is estimated as $10\\lesssim N_{Eff}\\lesssim 100$ for the\nparameters of the model constrained by experimental data.\n", "  Recently, a physically realistic protocol amplifying the randomness of\nSantha-Vazirani sources producing cryptographically secure random bits was\nproposed; however for reasons of practical relevance, the crucial question\nremained open whether this can be accomplished under the minimal conditions\nnecessary for the task. Namely, is it possible to achieve randomness\namplification using only two no-signaling components and in a situation where\nthe violation of a Bell inequality only guarantees that some outcomes of the\ndevice for specific inputs exhibit randomness? Here, we solve this question and\npresent a device-independent protocol for randomness amplification of\nSantha-Vazirani sources using a device consisting of two non-signaling\ncomponents. We show that the protocol can amplify any such source that is not\nfully deterministic into a fully random source while tolerating a constant\nnoise rate and prove the composable security of the protocol against general\nno-signaling adversaries. Our main innovation is the proof that even the\npartial randomness certified by the two-party Bell test (a single input-output\npair ($\\textbf{u}^*, \\textbf{x}^*$) for which the conditional probability\n$P(\\textbf{x}^* | \\textbf{u}^*)$ is bounded away from $1$ for all no-signaling\nstrategies that optimally violate the Bell inequality) can be used for\namplification. We introduce the methodology of a partial tomographic procedure\non the empirical statistics obtained in the Bell test that ensures that the\noutputs constitute a linear min-entropy source of randomness. As a technical\nnovelty that may be of independent interest, we prove that the Santha-Vazirani\nsource satisfies an exponential concentration property given by a recently\ndiscovered generalized Chernoff bound.\n", "  We present results of a search for giant radio galaxies (GRGs) with a\nprojected largest linear size in excess of 1 Mpc. We designed a computational\nalgorithm to identify contiguous emission regions, large and elongated enough\nto serve as GRG candidates, and applied it to the entire 1.4-GHz NRAO VLA Sky\nsurvey (NVSS). In a subsequent visual inspection of 1000 such regions we\ndiscovered 15 new GRGs, as well as many other candidate GRGs, some of them\npreviously reported, for which no redshift was known. Our follow-up\nspectroscopy of 25 of the brighter hosts using two 2.1-m telescopes in Mexico,\nand four fainter hosts with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), yielded\nanother 24 GRGs. We also obtained higher-resolution radio images with the Karl\nG. Jansky Very Large Array for GRG candidates with inconclusive radio\nstructures in NVSS.\n", "  We study the combination of hyperfine and Zeeman structure in the spin-orbit\ncoupled $A^1\\Sigma_u^+-b^3\\Pi_u$ complex of $^{87}\\textrm{Rb}_2$. For this\npurpose, absorption spectroscopy at a magnetic field around\n$B=1000\\:\\textrm{G}$ is carried out. We drive optical dipole transitions from\nthe lowest rotational state of an ultracold Feshbach molecule to various\nvibrational levels with $0^+$ symmetry of the $A-b$ complex. In contrast to\nprevious measurements with rotationally excited alkali-dimers, we do not\nobserve equal spacings of the hyperfine levels. In addition, the spectra vary\nsubstantially for different vibrational quantum numbers, and exhibit large\nsplittings of up to $160\\:\\textrm{MHz}$, unexpected for $0^+$ states. The level\nstructure is explained to be a result of the repulsion between the states $0^+$\nand $0^-$ of $b^3\\Pi_u$, coupled via hyperfine and Zeeman interactions. In\ngeneral, $0^-$ and $0^+$ have a spin-orbit induced energy spacing $\\Delta$,\nthat is different for the individual vibrational states. From each measured\nspectrum we are able to extract $\\Delta$, which otherwise is not easily\naccessible in conventional spectroscopy schemes. We obtain values of $\\Delta$\nin the range of $\\pm 100\\:\\textrm{GHz}$ which can be described by coupled\nchannel calculations if a spin-orbit coupling is introduced that is different\nfor $0^-$ and $0^+$ of $b^3\\Pi_u$.\n", "  We propose a model for addressing the superfluidity of two different Fermi\nspecies confined in a bilayer geometry of square optical lattices. The fermions\nare assumed to be molecules with interlayer s-wave interactions, whose dipole\nmoments are oriented perpendicularly to the layers. Using functional integral\ntechniques we investigate the BCS-like state induced in the bilayer at finite\ntemperatures. In particular, we determine the critical temperature as a\nfunction of the coupling strength between molecules in different layers and of\nthe interlayer spacing. By means of Ginzburg-Landau theory we calculate the\nsuperfluid density. We also study the dimerized BEC phase through the\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, where the effective mass leads to\nidentify the crossover from BCS to BEC regimes. The possibility of tuning the\neffective mass as a direct consequence of the lattice confinement, allows us to\nsuggest a range of values of the interlayer spacing, which would enable\nobserving this superfluidity within current experimental conditions.\n", "  We characterize the expected statistical errors with which the parameters of\nblack-hole binaries can be measured from gravitational-wave (GW) observations\nof their inspiral, merger and ringdown by a network of second-generation\nground-based GW observatories. We simulate a population of black-hole binaries\nwith uniform distribution of component masses in the interval $(3,80)~M_\\odot$,\ndistributed uniformly in comoving volume, with isotropic orientations. From\nsignals producing signal-to-noise ratio $\\geq 5$ in at least two detectors, we\nestimate the posterior distributions of the binary parameters using the\nBayesian parameter estimation code LALInference. The GW signals will be\nredshifted due to the cosmological expansion and we measure only the\n\"redshifted\" masses. By assuming a cosmology, it is possible to estimate the\ngravitational masses by inferring the redshift from the measured posterior of\nthe luminosity distance. We find that the measurement of the gravitational\nmasses will be in general dominated by the error in measuring the luminosity\ndistance. In spite of this, the component masses of more than $50\\%$ of the\npopulation can be measured with accuracy better than $\\sim 25\\%$ using the\nAdvanced LIGO-Virgo network. Additionally, the mass of the final black hole can\nbe measured with median accuracy $\\sim 18\\%$. Spin of the final black hole can\nbe measured with median accuracy $\\sim 5\\% ~(17\\%)$ for binaries with\nnon-spinning (aligned-spin) black holes. Additional detectors in Japan and\nIndia significantly improve the accuracy of sky localization, and moderately\nimprove the estimation of luminosity distance, and hence, that of all mass\nparameters. We discuss the implication of these results on the observational\nevidence of intermediate-mass black holes and the estimation of cosmological\nparameters using GW observations.\n", "  Motivated by the striking promise of quantum computation, Majorana bound\nstates (MBSs) in solid-state systems have attracted wide attention in recent\nyears. In particular, the wavefunction localization of MBSs is a key feature\nand crucial for their future implementation as qubits. Here, we investigate the\nspatial and electronic characteristics of topological superconducting chains of\niron atoms on the surface of Pb(110) by combining scanning tunneling microscopy\n(STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We demonstrate that the Fe chains are\nmono-atomic, structured in a linear fashion, and exhibit zero-bias conductance\npeaks at their ends which we interprete as signature for a Majorana bound\nstate. Spatially resolved conductance maps of the atomic chains reveal that the\nMBSs are well localized at the chain ends (below 25 nm), with two localization\nlengths as predicted by theory. Our observation lends strong support to use\nMBSs in Fe chains as qubits for quantum computing devices.\n", "  It is shown that the nature of quantum states that emerge from decoherence is\nsuch that one can {\\em measure} the expectation value of any observable of the\nsystem in a single measurement. This can be done even when such pointer states\nare a priori unknown. The possibility of measuring the expectation value of any\nobservable, without any prior knowledge of the state, points to the objective\nexistence of such states.\n", "  In this paper we propose a straightforward method for understanding the\nthermodynamics of black holes in de Sitter space, one that will allow us to\nstudy these black holes in a way that is analogous to the anti-de Sitter case.\nAs per usual, we formulate separate thermodynamic first laws for each horizon\npresent in the spacetime, and study their thermodynamics as if they were\nindependent systems characterized by their own temperature. That these systems\nare not entirely independent and various thermodynamic quantities in them are\nin fact \"correlated\" is reflected by the fact that their thermodynamics can be\ncaptured by a single Gibbs free energy-like thermodynamic potential. This\nquantity contains information about possible phase transitions in the system\nand allows us to uncover a rich phase structure for de Sitter black holes. In\nparticular, we discover reentrant phase transitions for Kerr-dS black holes in\nsix dimensions, a phenomenon recently observed for their six dimensional AdS\ncousins.\n", "  This study presents a numerical simulation of a 3D viscous flow in the\nVKI-Genoa cascade that takes into account the laminar-turbulent transition. The\nnumerical simulation is performed using the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes\nequations and the two-equation k-omega SST turbulence model. The algebraic\nProduction Term Modification model is used for modeling the laminar-turbulent\ntransition. Computations of both fully turbulent and transitional flows are\ncarried out. The contours of the Mach number, the turbulence kinetic energy,\nthe entropy function, as well as limiting streamlines are presented. The\nanalysis of the numerical results demonstrates the influence of the\nlaminar-turbulent transition on the secondary flow pattern. The comparison\nbetween the present computational results and the existing experimental and\nnumerical data shows that the proposed approach reflects sufficiently the\nphysics of the laminar-turbulent transition in turbine cascades.\n", "  The aim of this paper is to correct a mistake in earlier work on the\nconformal invariance of Rarita-Schwinger operators and use the method of\ncorrection to develop properties of some conformally invariant operators in the\nRarita-Schwinger setting. We also study properties of some other\nRarita-Schwinger type operators, for instance, twistor operators and dual\ntwistor operators. This work is also intended as an attempt to motivate the\nstudy of Rarita-Schwinger operators via some representation theory. This calls\nfor a review of earlier work by Stein and Weiss.\n", "  In this paper, we theoretically investigate how laser fields change the\nnature of topological Kondo insulators(TKIs). By employing a prototypical model\nof TKIs, we treat the effect of the laser fields with Floquet theory, which\ngives effective description under high frequency laser fields. We derive the\neffective model of TKIs under the laser irradiation and discuss its topological\nproperties. We demonstrate a possible realization of Floquet Chern insulators\nspecified by various values of Chern number and reveal how the topological\nphase changes with increasing the laser light intensity. Furthermore, it is\nshown that Floquet Weyl semimetals, which have some pairs of Weyl nodes\nprotected topologically, can emerge in the three-dimensional case. We explain\nhow the Weyl nodes are created with varying the strength of the laser field.\n", "  A discrete analogue of the Dirac equation in the Hestenes form is constructed\nby introduction the Clifford product on the space of discrete forms. We discuss\nthe relation between the discrete Dirac-K\\\"{a}hler equation and a discrete\nHestenes equation.\n", "  We present the first systematic investigation of spectral properties of 17\nType Ic Supernovae (SNe Ic), 10 broad-lined SNe Ic (SNe Ic-bl) without observed\nGamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and 11 SNe Ic-bl with GRBs (SN-GRBs) as a function of\ntime in order to probe their explosion conditions and progenitors. We analyze a\ntotal of 407 spectra, which were drawn from published spectra of individual SNe\nas well as from the densely time-sampled spectra data of Modjaz et al. (2014).\nIn order to quantify the diversity of the SN spectra as a function of SN\nsubtype, we construct average spectra of SNe Ic, SNe Ic-bl without GRBs and SNe\nIc-bl with GRBs. We find that SN 1994I is not a typical SN Ic, in contrast to\ncommon belief, while the spectra of SN 1998bw/GRB 980425 are representative of\nmean spectra of SNe Ic-bl. We measure the ejecta absorption and width\nvelocities using a new method described here and find that SNe Ic-bl with GRBs,\non average, have quantifiably higher absorption velocities, as well as broader\nline widths than SNe without observed GRBs. In addition, we search for\ncorrelations between SN-GRB spectral properties and the energies of their\naccompanying GRBs. Finally, we show that the absence of clear He lines in\noptical spectra of SNe Ic-bl, and in particular of SN-GRBs, is not due to them\nbeing too smeared out due to the high velocities present in the ejecta. This\nimplies that the progenitor stars of SN-GRBs are probably He-free, in addition\nto being H-free, which puts strong constraints on the stellar evolutionary\npaths needed to produce such SN-GRB progenitors at the observed low\nmetallicities.\n", "  We study stationary axially symmetric solutions of the Einstein vacuum field\nequations that can be used to describe the gravitational field of astrophysical\ncompact objects in the limiting case of slow rotation and slight deformation.\nWe derive explicitly the exterior Sedrakyan-Chubaryan approximate solution, and\nexpress it in analytical form, which makes it practical in the context of\nastrophysical applications. In the limiting case of vanishing angular momentum,\nthe solution reduces to the well-known Schwarzschild solution in vacuum. We\ndemonstrate that the new solution is equivalent to the exterior Hartle-Thorne\nsolution. We establish the mathematical equivalence between the\nSedrakyan-Chubaryan, Fock-Abdildin and Hartle-Thorne formalisms.\n", "  By using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, the dynamics of\ntwo-dimensional (2D) supercooled liquids turns out to be dependent on the\nsystem size, while the size dependence is not pronounced in three dimensional\n(3D) systems. It is demonstrated that the strong system-size effect in 2D\namorphous systems originates from the enhanced fluctuations at long\nwavelengths, which are similar to those of 2D crystal phonons. This observation\nis further supported by the frequency dependence of the vibrational density of\nstates, consisting of the Debye approximation in the low-wavenumber-limit.\nHowever, the system-size effect in the intermediate scattering function becomes\nnegligible when the length scale is larger than the vibrational amplitude. This\nsuggests that the finite-size effect in a 2D system is transient and also that\nthe structural relaxation itself is not fundamentally different from that in a\n3D system. In fact, the dynamic correlation lengths estimated from the\nbond-breakage function, which do not suffer from those enhanced fluctuations,\nare not size dependent in either 2D or 3D systems.\n", "  In this work we present a Finslerian version of the well-known pp-waves,\nwhich generalizes the very special relativity (VSR) line element. Our Finsler\npp-waves are an exact solution of Finslerian Einstein's equations in vacuum.\n", "  Are the FRI and FRII radio galaxies representative of the radio-loud (RL) AGN\npopulation in the local Universe? Recent studies on the local low-luminosity\nradio sources cast lights on an emerging population of compact radio galaxies\nwhich lack extended radio emission. In a pilot JVLA project, we study the\nhigh-resolution images of a small but representative sample of this population.\nThe radio maps reveal compact unresolved or slightly resolved radio structures\non a scale of 1-3 kpc. We find that these RL AGN live in red massive early-type\ngalaxies, with large black hole masses ($\\gtrsim$10$^{8}$ M$_{\\odot}$), and\nspectroscopically classified as Low Excitation Galaxies, all characteristics\ntypical of FRI radio galaxies which they also share the same nuclear luminosity\nwith. However, they are more core dominated (by a factor of $\\sim$30) than FRIs\nand show a clear deficit of extended radio emission. We call these sources\n'FR0' to emphasize their lack of prominent extended radio emission. A\nposteriori, other compact radio sources found in the literature fulfill the\nrequirements for a FR0 classification. Hence, the emerging FR0 population\nappears to be the dominant radio class of the local Universe. Considering their\nproperties we speculate on their possible origins and the possible cosmological\nscenarios they imply.\n", "  The long coherence times and strong Coulomb interactions afforded by trapped\nion qubits have enabled realizations of the necessary primitives for quantum\ninformation processing (QIP), and indeed the highest-fidelity quantum\noperations in any qubit to date. But while light delivery to each individual\nion in a system is essential for general quantum manipulations and readout,\nexperiments so far have employed optical systems cumbersome to scale to even a\nfew tens of qubits. Here we demonstrate lithographically defined nanophotonic\nwaveguide devices for light routing and ion addressing fully integrated within\na surface-electrode ion trap chip. Ion qubits are addressed at multiple\nlocations via focusing grating couplers emitting through openings in the trap\nelectrodes to ions trapped 50 $\\mu$m above the chip; using this light we\nperform quantum coherent operations on the optical qubit transition in\nindividual $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ions. The grating focuses the beam to a\ndiffraction-limited spot near the ion position with a 2 $\\mu$m 1/$e^2$-radius\nalong the trap axis, and we measure crosstalk errors between $10^{-2}$ and\n$4\\times10^{-4}$ at distances 7.5-15 $\\mu$m from the beam center. Owing to the\nscalability of the planar fabrication employed, together with the tight\nfocusing and stable alignment afforded by optics integration within the trap\nchip, this approach presents a path to creating the optical systems required\nfor large-scale trapped-ion QIP.\n", "  In a recently proposed theory, the cosmological constant (CC) does not curve\nspacetime in our universe, but instead gets absorbed into another universe\nendowed with its own dynamical metric, nonlocally coupled to ours. Thus, one\nachieves a long standing goal of removing entirely any cosmological constant\nfrom our universe. Dark energy then cannot be due to a cosmological constant,\nbut must be obtained via other mechanisms. Here we focus on the scenario in\nwhich dark energy is due to massive gravity and its extensions. We show how the\nmetric of the other universe, that absorbs our CC, also gives rise to the\nfiducial metric known to be necessary for the diffeomorphism invariant\nformulation of massive gravity. This is achieved in a framework where the other\nuniverse is described by 5D AdS gravity, while our universe lives on its\nboundary and is endowed with dynamical massive gravity. A non-dynamical\npullback of the bulk AdS metric acts as the fiducial metric for massive gravity\non the boundary. This framework also removes a difficulty caused by the quantum\nstrongly coupled behavior of massive gravity at the Lambda3 scale: in the\npresent approach, the massive gravity action does not receive any loop-induced\ncounterterms, despite being strongly coupled.\n", "  The increasing number of Very High Energy (VHE) sources discovered by the\ncurrent generation of Cherenkov telescopes made particularly relevant the\ncreation of a dedicated source catalogs as well as the cross-correlation of VHE\nand lower energy bands data in a multi-wavelength framework. The \"TeGeV\nCatalog\" hosted at the ASI Science Data Center (ASDC) is a catalog of VHE\nsources detected by ground-based Cherenkov detectors. The TeGeVcat collects all\nthe relevant information publicly available about the observed GeV/TeV sources.\nThe catalog contains also information about public light curves while the\navailable spectral data are included in the ASDC SED Builder tool directly\naccessible from the TeGeV catalog web page. In this contribution we will report\na comprehensive description of the catalog and the related tools.\n", "  We numerically construct the BPS and non-BPS wavefunctions of an\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ quiver quantum mechanics with two Abelian nodes and a single\narrow. This model captures the dynamics of a pair of wrapped D-branes\ninteracting via a single light string mode. A dimensionless parameter $\\nu$,\nwhich is inversely proportional to the Fayet-Iliopoulos parameter, controls\nwhether the bulk of the wavefunctions are supported on the Higgs branch or the\nCoulomb branch. We demonstrate how the BPS and excited states morph as $\\nu$ is\ntuned. We also numerically compute the energy gap between the ground state and\nthe first excited states as a function of $\\nu$. An expression for the gap,\ncomputed on the Coulomb branch, matches nicely with our numerics at large $\\nu$\nbut deviates at small $\\nu$ where the Higgs branch becomes the relevant\ndescription of the physics. In the appendix, we provide the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequations fully reduced via symmetries which, in principle, allow for the\nnumerical determination of the entire spectrum at any point in moduli space.\nFor the ground states, this numerical determination of the spectrum can be\nthought of as the first \\emph{in silico} check of various Witten index\ncalculations.\n", "  We present neutral hydrogen (HI) and warm molecular hydrogen (H2)\nobservations of the young (10^2 years) radio galaxy PKS B1718-649. We study the\nmorphology and the kinematics of both gas components, focusing, in particular,\non their properties in relation to the triggering of the radio activity. The\nregular kinematics of the large scale HI disk, seen in emission, suggests that\nan interaction event occurred too long ago to be responsible for the recent\ntriggering of the radio activity. In absorption, we detect two absorption lines\nalong the narrow line of sight of the compact (r<2 pc) radio source. The lines\ntrace two clouds with opposite radial motions. These may represent a population\nof clouds in the very inner regions of the galaxy, which may be involved in\ntriggering the radio activity. The warm molecular hydrogen (H2 1-0 S(1)\nro-vibrational line) in the innermost kilo-parsec of the galaxy appears to be\ndistributed in a circum-nuclear disk following the regular kinematics of the HI\nand of the stellar component. An exception to this behaviour arises only in the\nvery centre, where a highly dispersed component is detected. These particular\nHI and H2 features suggest that a strong interplay between the radio source and\nthe surrounding ISM is on-going. The physical properties of the cold gas in the\nproximity of the radio source may regulate the accretion recently triggered in\nthis AGN.\n", "  Compact Steep Spectrum, Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum and High Frequency Peak\n(CSS, GPS, HFP) sources are considered to be young radio sources but the\ndetails of their duty cycle are not well understood. In some cases they are\nthought to develop in large radio galaxies, while in other cases their jets may\nexperience intermittent activity or die prematurely and remain confined within\nthe host galaxy. By studying in a systematic way the presence and the\nproperties of any extended emission surrounding these compact sources we can\nprovide firmer constraints on their evolutionary history and on the timescales\nof activity of the radio source. Remnant emission from previous outbursts is\nsupposed to have very low surface brightness and to be brighter at low\nfrequency. Taking advantage of the unprecedented sensitivity and resolution\nprovided by the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) we have started a systematic search\nof new CSS, GPS and HFP sources with extended emission, as well as a more\ndetailed study of some well-known of these sources. Here we present the key\npoints of our search in the LOFAR fields and a more in-depth analysis on the\nsource B2 0258+35, a CSS source surrounded by a pair of large, diffuse radio\nlobes.\n", "  At present neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) gas in galaxies at redshifts above $z\n\\sim 0.3$ (the extent of 21-cm emission surveys in individual galaxies) and\nbelow $z \\sim 1.7$ (where the Lyman-$\\alpha$ line is not observable with\nground-based telescopes) has remained largely unexplored. The advent of\nprecursor telescopes to the Square Kilometre Array will allow us to conduct the\nfirst systematic radio-selected 21-cm absorption surveys for HI over these\nredshifts. While HI absorption is a tracer of the reservoir of cold neutral gas\nin galaxies available for star formation, it can also be used to reveal the\nextreme kinematics associated with jet-driven neutral outflows in radio-loud\nactive galactic nuclei. Using the six-antenna Boolardy Engineering Test Array\nof the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, we have demonstrated that\nin a single frequency tuning we can detect HI absorption over a broad range of\nredshifts between $z = 0.4$ and $1.0$. As part of our early science and\ncommissioning program, we are now carrying out a search for absorption towards\na sample of the brightest GPS and CSS sources in the southern sky. These\nintrinsically compact sources present us with an opportunity to study the\ncircumunuclear region of recently re-started radio galaxies, in some cases\nshowing direct evidence of mechanical feedback through jet-driven outflows.\nWith the sensitivity of the full ASKAP array we will be able to study the\nkinematics of atomic gas in a few thousand radio galaxies, testing models of\nradio jet feedback well beyond the nearby Universe\n", "  We have observed the faintest sample of Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum (GPS) and\nCompact Steep Spectrum (CSS) sources to date, using the Australia Telescope\nCompact Array. We test the hypothesis that GPS and CSS sources are the youngest\nradio galaxies, place them into an evolutionary sequence along with a number of\nother young Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) candidates, and search for evidence of\nthe evolving accretion mode and its relationship to star formation. GPS/CSS\nsources have very small radio jets that have been recently launched from the\ncentral Supermassive Black Hole and grow in linear size as they evolve, which\nmeans that the linear size of the jets is an excellent indicator of the\nevolutionary stage of the AGN. We use high-resolution radio observations to\ndetermine the linear size of GPS/CSS sources, resolve their jets and observe\ntheir small-scale morphologies. We combine this with other multi-wavelength age\nindicators, including the spectral age, colours, optical spectra and Spectral\nEnergy Distribution of the host galaxy, in an attempt to assemble all age\nindicators into a self-consistent model. We observe the most compact sources\nwith Very Large Baseline Interferometry, which reveals their parsec-scale\nstructures, giving us a range of source sizes and allowing us to test what\nfraction of GPS/CSS sources are young and evolving.\n", "  The role of historical contingency in the origin of life is one of the great\nunknowns in modern science. Only one example of life exists--one that proceeded\nfrom a single self-replicating organism (or a set of replicating hyper-cycles)\nto the vast complexity we see today in Earth's biosphere. We know that emergent\nlife has the potential to evolve great increases in complexity, but it is\nunknown if evolvability is automatic given any self-replicating organism. At\nthe same time, it is difficult to test such questions in biochemical systems.\nLaboratory studies with RNA replicators have had some success with exploring\nthe capacities of simple self-replicators, but these experiments are still\nlimited in both capabilities and scope. Here, we use the digital evolution\nsystem Avida to explore the interaction between emergent replicators (rare\nrandomly-assembled self-replicators) and evolvability. We find that we can\nclassify fixed-length emergent replicators in Avida into two classes based on\nfunctional analysis. One class is more evolvable in the sense of optimizing\ntheir replication abilities. However, the other class is more evolvable in the\nsense of acquiring evolutionary innovations. We tie this trade-off in\nevolvability to the structure of the respective classes' replication machinery,\nand speculate on the relevance of these results to biochemical replicators.\n", "  The recent experimental realization of synthetic spin-orbit coupling (SOC)\nopens a new avenue for exploring novel quantum states with ultracold atoms.\nHowever, in experiments for generating two-dimensional SOC (e.g., Rashba type),\na perpendicular Zeeman field, which opens a band gap at the Dirac point and\ninduces many topological phenomena, is still lacking. Here we theoretically\npropose and experimentally realize a simple scheme for generating two-dimension\nSOC and a perpendicular Zeeman field simultaneously in ultracold Fermi gases by\ntuning the polarization of three Raman lasers that couple three hyperfine\nground states of atoms. The resulting band gap opening at the Dirac point is\nprobed using spin injection radio-frequency spectroscopy. Our observation may\npave the way for exploring topological transport and topological superfluids\nwith exotic Majorana and Weyl fermion excitations in ultracold atoms.\n", "  We demonstrate that Ramsey spectroscopy can be used to observe\nRydberg-dressed interactions. In contrast to many prior proposals, our scheme\noperates comfortably within experimentally measured lifetimes, and accesses a\nregime where quantum superpositions are crucial. The key idea is to build a\nspin-1/2 from one level that is Rydberg-dressed and another that is not. These\nlevels may be hyperfine or long-lived electronic states. An Ising spin model\ngoverns the Ramsey dynamics, for which we derive an exact solution. Due to the\nstructure of Rydberg interactions, the dynamics differs significantly from that\nin other spin systems. As one example, spin echo can increase the rate at which\ncoherence decays. The results also apply to bare (undressed) Rydberg states as\na special case, for which we quantitatively reproduce recent ultrafast\nexperiments without fitting.\n", "  The purpose of this paper is to propose a continuum micromechanics model for\nthe simulation of uniaxial compressive and tensile tests on lime-based mortars,\nin order to predict their stiffness, compressive and tensile strengths, and\ntensile fracture energy. In tension, we adopt an incremental strain-controlled\nform of the Mori-Tanaka scheme with a damageable matrix phase, while a simple\n$J_2$ yield criterion is employed in compression. To reproduce the behavior of\nlime-based mortars correctly, the scheme must take into account shrinkage\ncracking among aggregates. This phenomenon is introduced into the model via\npenny-shaped cracks, whose density is estimated on the basis of a particle size\ndistribution combined with the results of finite element analyses of a single\ncrack formation between two spherical inclusions. Our predictions show a good\nagreement with experimental data and explain the advantages of compliant\ncrushed brick fragments, often encountered in ancient mortars, over stiff sand\nparticles. The validated model provides a reliable tool for optimizing the\ncomposition of modern lime-based mortars with applications in conservation and\nrestoration of architectural heritage.\n", "  Phosphorene, a new elemental two dimensional (2D) material recently isolated\nby mechanical exfoliation, holds the feature of a direct band gap of around 2.0\neV, overcoming graphene's weaknesses (zero band gap) to realize the potential\napplication in optoelectronic devices. Constructing van der Waals\nheterostructures is an efficient approach to modulate the band structure, to\nadvance the charge separation efficiency, and thus to optimize the\noptoelectronic properties. Here, we theoretically investigated three type-II\nheterostructures based on perfect phosphorene and its doped monolayers\ninterfaced with TiO$_2$(110) surface. Doping in phosphorene has a tunability on\nbuilt-in potential, charge transfer, light absorbance, as well as electron\ndynamics, which helps to optimize the light absorption efficiency. Three\nexcitonic solar cells (XSCs) based on the phosphorene$-$TiO$_2$ heterojunctions\nhave been proposed, which exhibit high power conversion efficiencies dozens of\ntimes higher than conventional solar cells, comparable to MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ XSC.\nThe nonadiabatic molecular dynamics within the time-dependent density\nfunctional theory framework shows ultrafast electron transfer time of\n6.1$-$10.8 fs, and slow electron$-$hole recombination of 0.58$-$1.08 ps,\nyielding $>98\\%$ quantum efficiency for charge separation, further guaranteeing\nthe practical power conversion efficiencies in XSC.\n", "  The Neutron-star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) is an X-ray\nastrophysics payload that will be placed on the International Space Station.\nIts primary science goal is to measure with high accuracy the pulse profiles\nthat arise from the non-uniform thermal surface emission of rotation-powered\npulsars. Modeling general relativistic effects on the profiles will lead to\nmeasuring the radii of these neutron stars and to constraining their equation\nof state. Achieving this goal will depend, among other things, on accurate\nknowledge of the source, sky, and instrument backgrounds. We use here simple\nanalytic estimates to quantify the level at which these backgrounds need to be\nknown in order for the upcoming measurements to provide significant constraints\non the properties of neutron stars. We show that, even in the\nminimal-information scenario, knowledge of the background at a few percent\nlevel for a background-to-source countrate ratio of 0.2 allows for a\nmeasurement of the neutron star compactness to better than 10% uncertainty for\nmost of the parameter space. These constraints improve further when more\nrealistic assumptions are made about the neutron star emission and spin, and\nwhen additional information about the source itself, such as its mass or\ndistance, are incorporated.\n", "  We present a particularly simple model of axion monodromy: Our axion is the\nlowest-lying KK-mode of the RR-2-form-potential $C_2$ in the standard\nKlebanov-Strassler throat. One can think of this inflaton candidate as being\ndefined by the integral of $C_2$ over the $S^2$ cycle of the throat. It obtains\nan exponentially small mass from the IR-region in which the $S^2$ shrinks to\nzero size both with respect to the Planck scale and the mass scale of local\nmodes of the throat. Crucially, the $S^2$ cycle has to be shared between two\nthroats, such that the second locus where the $S^2$ shrinks is also in a warped\nregion. Well-known problems like the potentially dangerous back-reaction of\nbrane/antibrane pairs and explicit supersymmetry breaking are not present in\nour scenario. However, the inflaton back-reaction starts to deform the geometry\nstrongly once the field excursion approaches the Planck scale. We derive the\nsystem of differential equations required to treat this effect quantitatively.\nNumerical work is required to decide whether back-reaction makes the model\nsuitable for realistic inflation. While we have to leave this crucial issue to\nfuture studies, we find it interesting that such a simple and explicit stringy\nmonodromy model allows an originally sub-Planckian axion to go through many\nperiods with full quantitative control before back-reaction becomes strong.\nAlso, the mere existence of our ultra-light throat mode (with double\nexponentially suppressed mass) is noteworthy.\n", "  We propose an experimental setup using ultracold atoms to implement a bilayer\nhoneycomb lattice with Bernal stacking. In presence of a potential bias between\nthe layers and at low densities, Fermions placed in this lattice form an\nannular Fermi sea. The presence of two Fermi surfaces leads to interesting\npatterns in Friedel oscillations and RKKY interactions in presence of\nimpurities. Furthermore, a repulsive fermion-fermion interaction leads to a\nStoner instability towards an incommensurate spin-density-wave order with a\nwave vector equal to the thickness of the Fermi sea. The instability occurs at\na critical interaction strength which goes down with the density of the\nfermions. We find that the instability survives interaction renormalization due\nto vertex corrections and discuss how this can be seen in experiments. We also\ntrack the renormalization group flows of the different couplings between the\nfermionic degrees of freedom, and find that there are no perturbative\ninstabilities, and that Stoner instability is the strongest instability which\noccurs at a critical threshold value of the interaction. The critical\ninteraction goes to zero as the chemical potential is tuned towards the band\nbottom.\n", "  We present an approach to the four laws of black hole thermodynamics by\nutilizing the thermodynamics of quantum coherence. Firstly, Hawking effect is\nattributed to the decoherence of the two-mode squeezed state in a black hole\nspacetime. Then use is made of the relative entropy between undecohered and\ndecohered squeezed states whose monotonicity gives the zeroth and the second\nlaw, while the first law can be obtained either by the vanishing of the first\nderivative of relative entropy or by studying the effective thermal model\ngenerated by the modular Hamiltonian. Futhermore, information-theoretic\narguments give a Planck's form of the third law of black hole thermodynamics.\nWith this approach we can understand the laboratory analogues of black holes\nsolely by quantum theory, and find a way to detect the thermodynamics of black\nholes produced in colliders.\n", "  The propagation of a weak optical pulse through an atomic system in closed\n$\\Lambda$ configuration is investigated in which the hyper fine levels are\ncoupled by a microwave pulse. Under three photon resonance condition, it is\nobserved that the probe pulse shape gets cloned by the shape of the microwave\npulse along propagation through the medium. The temporal position of the probe\npulse is dragged to that of the microwave pulse. A simple expression for the\nlinear susceptibility of the medium for the corresponding transition is derived\nin the Fourier domain. From the numerical analysis of dynamics using this\nexpression, it is concluded that the novel effect arises from the ground state\ncoherence of the hyper fine transitions induced by the microwave pulse.\n", "  Electrical transport measurements are used to study the Rh-doped NaFeAs\nsuperconductor series with a focus on the tetragonal phase. The resistivity\ncurvature has an anomalous temperature dependence evidencing in the phase\ndiagram two crossover regions of changes in the scattering rate, the effective\nmass as well as of the charge carrier density. The first crossover region is\ndirectly connected to the structural transition and resembles the onset of\nresistivity anisotropy. The second crossover region can as well be deduced from\nthe temperature dependent Hall coefficient. A comparison to literature NMR data\nsuggests this region to be connected with nematic fluctuations far above the\ntetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition.\n", "  We present a formula for the spectroscopically accessible level shifts and\ndecay rates of an atom moving at an arbitrary angle relative to a surface. Our\nMarkov formulation leads to an intuitive analytic description whereby the\nshifts and rates are obtained from the coefficients of the Heisenberg equation\nof motion for the atomic flip operators but with complex Doppler-shifted\n(velocity-dependent) transition frequencies. Our results conclusively\ndemonstrate that for the limiting case of parallel motion the shifts and rates\nare quadratic or higher in the atomic velocity. We show that a stronger, linear\nvelocity dependence is exhibited by the rates and shifts for perpendicular\nmotion, thus opening the prospect of experimentally probing the Markovian\napproach to the phenomenon of quantum friction.\n", "  From a mathematical model that describes a complex chemical kinetic system of\n$N$ species and $M$ elementrary reactions in a rapidly stirred vessel of size\n$V$ as a Markov process, we show that a macroscopic chemical thermodynamics\nemerges as $V\\rightarrow\\infty$. The theory is applicable to linear and\nnonlinear reactions, closed systems reaching chemical equilibrium, or open,\ndriven systems approaching to nonequilibrium steady states. A generalized\nmesoscopic free energy gives rise to a macroscopic chemical energy function\n$\\varphi^{ss}(\\vx)$ where $\\vx=(x_1,\\cdots,x_N)$ are the concentrations of the\n$N$ chemical species. The macroscopic chemical dynamics $\\vx(t)$ satisfies two\nemergent laws: (1) $(\\rd/\\rd t)\\varphi^{ss}[\\vx(t)]\\le 0$, and (2)$(\\rd/\\rd\nt)\\varphi^{ss}[\\vx(t)]=\\text{cmf}(\\vx)-\\sigma(\\vx)$ where entropy production\nrate $\\sigma\\ge 0$ represents the sink for the chemical energy, and chemical\nmotive force $\\text{cmf}\\ge 0$ is non-zero if the system is driven under a\nsustained nonequilibrium chemostat. For systems with detailed balance\n$\\text{cmf}=0$, and if one assumes the law of mass action,$\\varphi^{ss}(\\vx)$\nis precisely the Gibbs' function $\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i\\big[\\mu_i^o+\\ln x_i\\big]$\nfor ideal solutions. For a class of kinetic systems called complex balanced,\nwhich include many nonlinear systems as well as many simple open, driven\nchemical systems, the $\\varphi^{ss}(\\vx)$, with global minimum at $\\vx^*$, has\nthe generic form $\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i\\big[\\ln(x_i/x_i^*)-x_i+x_i^*\\big]$,which has\nbeen known in chemical kinetic literature.Macroscopic emergent \"laws\" are\nindependent of the details of the underlying kinetics. This theory provides a\nconcrete example from chemistry showing how a dynamic macroscopic law can\nemerge from the kinetics at a level below.\n", "  The magnetic field of a sunspot guides magnetohydrodynamic waves toward\nhigher atmospheric layers. In the upper photosphere and lower chromosphere,\nwave modes with periods longer than the acoustic cut-off period become\nevanescent. The cut-off period essentially changes due to the atmospheric\nproperties, e.g., increases for larger zenith inclinations of the magnetic\nfield. In this work, we aim at introducing a novel technique of reconstructing\nthe magnetic field inclination on the basis of the dominating wave periods in\nthe sunspot chromosphere and upper photosphere. On 2013 August 21st, we\nobserved an isolated, circular sunspot (NOAA11823) for 58 min in a purely\nspectroscopic multi-wavelength mode with the Interferometric Bidimensional\nSpectro-polarimeter (IBIS) at the Dunn Solar Telescope. By means of a wavelet\npower analysis, we retrieved the dominating wave periods and reconstructed the\nzenith inclinations in the chromosphere and upper photosphere. The results are\nin good agreement with the lower photospheric HMI magnetograms. The sunspot's\nmagnetic field in the chromosphere inclines from almost vertical (0$^{\\circ}$)\nin the umbra to around 60$^{\\circ}$ in the outer penumbra. With increasing\naltitude in the sunspot atmosphere, the magnetic field of the penumbra becomes\nless inclined. We conclude that the reconstruction of the magnetic field\ntopology on the basis of sunspot oscillations yields consistent and conclusive\nresults. The technique opens up a new possibility to infer the magnetic field\ninclination in the solar chromosphere.\n", "  Recent measurements of vertical extents and positions of the chromospheric\nhard X-ray (HXR) flare sources based on Ramaty High-Energy Spectroscopic Imager\n(RHESSI) observations show a significant inconsistency with the theoretical\npredictions based on the standard collisional thick target model (CTTM). Using\na hybrid flare code Flarix, we model simultaneously and self-consistently the\npropagation, scattering and energy losses of electron beams with power-law\nenergy spectra and various initial pitch-angle distributions in a purely\ncollisional approximation and concurrently the dynamic response of the heated\nchromosphere on timescales typical for RHESSI image reconstruction. The results\nof the simulations are used to model the time evolution of the vertical\ndistribution of chromospheric HXR source within a singular (compact) loop.\nAdopting the typical RHESSI imaging times scales, energy dependent vertical\nsizes and positions as could be observed by RHESSI are presented.\n", "  We consider the detailed dynamics of an array of quantised superfluid\nvortices in the framework of general relativity, as required for quantitative\nmodelling of realistic neutron star cores. Our model builds on the variational\napproach to relativistic (multi-) fluid dynamics, where the vorticity plays a\ncentral role. The description provides a natural extension of, and as it\nhappens a better insight into, existing Newtonian models. In particular, we\naccount for the mutual friction associated with scattering of a second \"normal\"\ncomponent in the mixture off of the superfluid vortices.\n", "  We challenge the interpretation of the di-photon excess recently observed by\nboth ATLAS and CMS in a two Higgs doublet framework. Due to the large\nenhancement necessary to obtain the observed di-photon signal, a large number\nof colored and charged vector-like fermions are called for. We find that even\nbefore the hypercharge gauge coupling becomes non perturbative, the one loop\neffects of these fermions abruptly drive the scalar potential to instability.\n", "  A new additive and semidefinite programming (SDP) computable entanglement\nmeasure is introduced to upper bound the amount of distillable entanglement in\nbipartite quantum states by operations completely preserving the positivity of\npartial transpose (PPT). This quantity is always smaller than or equal to the\nlogarithmic negativity, the previously best known SDP bound on distillable\nentanglement, and the inequality is strict in general. Furthermore, a succinct\nSDP characterization of the one-copy PPT deterministic distillable entanglement\nfor any given state is also obtained, which provides a simple but useful lower\nbound on the PPT distillable entanglement. Remarkably, there is a genuinely\nmixed state of which both bounds coincide with the distillable entanglement\nwhile being strictly less than the logarithmic negativity.\n", "  The decay rates of quasistable states in quantum field theories are usually\ncalculated using instanton methods. Standard derivations of these methods rely\nin a crucial way upon deformations and analytic continuations of the physical\npotential, and on the saddle point approximation. While the resulting procedure\ncan be checked against other semi-classical approaches in some one-dimensional\ncases, it is challenging to trace the role of the relevant physical scales, and\nany intuitive handle on the precision of the approximations involved are at\nbest obscure. In this paper, we use a physical definition of the tunneling\nprobability to derive a formula for the decay rate in both quantum mechanics\nand quantum field theory directly from the Minkowski path integral, without\nreference to unphysical deformations of the potential. There are numerous\nbenefits to this approach, from non-perturbative applications to precision\ncalculations and aesthetic simplicity.\n", "  We implemented the derivative of the free energy functional with respect to\nthe atom displacements, so called force, within the combination of Density\nFunctional Theory and the Embedded Dynamical Mean Field Theory. We show that in\ncombination with the numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo (MC) impurity\nsolver, the MC noise cancels to a great extend, so that the method can be used\nvery efficiently for structural optimization of correlated electron materials.\nAs an application of the method, we show how strengthening of the fluctuating\nmoment in FeSe superconductor leads to a substantial increase of the anion\nheight, and consequently to a very large effective mass, and also strong\norbital differentiation.\n", "  Spaces equipped with two complementary (distinct) congruences of self-dual\nnull strings and at least one congruence of anti-self-dual null strings are\nconsidered. It is shown that if such spaces are Einsteinian then the vacuum\nEinstein field equations can be reduced to a single nonlinear partial\ndifferential equation of the second order. Different forms of these equations\nare analyzed. Finally, several new explicit metrics of the para-Hermite and\npara-K\\\"{a}hler Einstein spaces with $\\Lambda \\ne 0$ are presented. Some\nrelation of that metrics to a modern approach to mechanical issues is\ndiscussed.\n", "  Using a one-dimensional minisuperspace model with a dimensionless ratio\n$\\frac{E}{E_{Pl}}$, we study the initial singularity problem at the quantum\nlevel for the closed rainbow cosmology with a homogeneous, isotropic classical\nspace-time background. We derive the classical Hamiltonian within the framework\nof Schutz's formalism for an ideal fluid with a cosmological constant. We\ncharacterize the behavior of the system at the early stages of the universe\nevolution through analyzing the relevant shapes for the potential sector of the\nclassical Hamiltonian for various matter sources, each separately modified by\ntwo rainbow functions. We show that for both rainbow universe models presented\nhere, there is the possibility of eliminating the initial singularity by\nforming a potential barrier and static universe for a non-zero value of the\nscale factor. We investigate their quantum stability and show that for an\nenergy-dependent space-time geometry with energies comparable with the Planck\nenergy, the non-zero value of the scale factor may be stable. It is shown that\nunder certain constraints the rainbow universe model filled with an exotic\nmatter as a domain wall fluid plus a cosmological constant can result in a\nnon-singular harmonic universe. In addition, we demonstrate that the\nharmonically oscillating universe with respect to the scale factor is sensitive\nto $\\frac{E}{E_{Pl}}$ and that at high energies it may become stable quantum\nmechanically. Through a Schr\\\"{o}dinger-Wheeler-De Witt (SWD) equation obtained\nfrom the quantization of the classical Hamiltonian, we also extract the wave\npacket of the universe with a focus on the early stages of the evolution.\n", "  Quasar emission lines are often shifted from the systemic velocity due to\nvarious dynamical and radiative processes in the line-emitting region. The\nlevel of these velocity shifts depends both on the line species and on quasar\nproperties. We study velocity shifts for the line peaks of various narrow and\nbroad quasar emission lines relative to systemic using a sample of 849 quasars\nfrom the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping (SDSS-RM) project. The\ncoadded (from 32 epochs) spectra of individual quasars have sufficient\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to measure stellar absorption lines to provide\nreliable systemic velocity estimates, as well as weak narrow emission lines.\nThe sample also covers a large dynamic range in quasar luminosity (~2 dex),\nallowing us to explore potential luminosity dependence of the velocity shifts.\nWe derive average line peak velocity shifts as a function of quasar luminosity\nfor different lines, and quantify their intrinsic scatter. We further quantify\nhow well the peak velocity can be measured for various lines as a function of\ncontinuum SNR, and demonstrate there is no systematic bias in the line peak\nmeasurements when the spectral quality is degraded to as low as SNR~3 per SDSS\npixel. Based on the observed line shifts, we provide empirical guidelines on\nredshift estimation from [OII]3728, [OIII]5008, [NeV]3426, MgII, CIII],\nHeII1640, broad Hbeta, CIV, and SiIV, which are calibrated to provide unbiased\nsystemic redshifts in the mean, but with increasing intrinsic uncertainties of\n46, 56, 119, 205, 233, 242, 400, 415, and 477 km/s, in addition to the\nmeasurement uncertainties. These more realistic redshift uncertainties are\ngenerally much larger than the formal uncertainties reported by the redshift\npipelines for spectroscopic quasar surveys, and demonstrate the infeasibility\nof measuring quasar redshifts to better than ~200 km/s with only broad lines.\n", "  We present a proof-of-principle experiment demonstrating measurement of the\ncollectibility, a nonlinear entanglement witness proposed by Rudnicki et al.\n[Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 150502 (2011)]. This entanglement witness works for both\nmixed and pure two-qubit states. In the later case it can be used to measure\nentanglement in terms of the negativity. We measured the collectibility for\nthree distinct classes of photonic polarization-encoded two-qubit states, i.e.,\nmaximally entangled, separable and maximally mixed states. We demonstrate that\nthe measurement procedure is feasible and robust against typical experimental\nshortcomings such as imperfect two-photon indistinguishability.\n", "  Magnetism and nematic order are the two non-superconducting orders observed\nin iron-based superconductors. To elucidate the interplay between them and\nultimately unveil the pairing mechanism, several models have been investigated.\nIn models with quenched orbital degrees of freedom, magnetic fluctuations\npromote stripe magnetism which induces orbital order. In models with quenched\nspin degrees of freedom, charge fluctuations promote spontaneous orbital order\nwhich induces stripe magnetism. Here we develop an unbiased approach, in which\nwe treat magnetic and orbital fluctuations on equal footing. Key to our\napproach is the inclusion of the orbital character of the low-energy electronic\nstates into renormalization group analysis. Our results show that in systems\nwith large Fermi energies, such as BaFe2As2, LaFeAsO, and NaFeAs, orbital order\nis induced by stripe magnetism. However, in systems with small Fermi energies,\nsuch as FeSe, the system develops a spontaneous orbital order, while magnetic\norder does not develop. Our results provide a unifying description of different\niron-based materials.\n", "  We study an interesting relevant deformation of the simplest interacting N=2\nSCFT---the original Argyres-Douglas (AD) theory. We argue that, although this\ndeformation is not strictly speaking Banks-Zaks like (certain operator\ndimensions change macroscopically), there are senses in which it constitutes a\nmild deformation of the parent AD theory: the exact change in the \"a\" anomaly\nis small and is essentially saturated at one loop. Moreover, contributions from\nIR operators that have a simple description in the UV theory reproduce a\nparticular limit of the IR index to a remarkably high order. These results lead\nus to conclude that the IR theory is an interacting N=1 SCFT with particularly\nsmall \"a\" and \"c\" central charges and that this theory sheds some interesting\nlight on the spectrum of its AD parent.\n", "  The interface between the two complex oxides LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 has remarkable\nproperties that can be locally reconfigured between conducting and insulating\nstates using a conductive atomic force microscope. Prior investigations of\nsketched quantum dot devices revealed a phase in which electrons form pairs,\nimplying a strongly attractive electron-electron interaction. Here, we show\nthat these devices with strong electron-electron interactions can exhibit a\ngate-tunable transition from a pair-tunneling regime to a single-electron\n(Andreev bound state) tunneling regime where the interactions become repulsive.\nThe electron-electron interaction sign change is associated with a Lifshitz\ntransition where the dxz and dyz bands start to become occupied. This\nelectronically tunable electron-electron interaction, combined with the\nnanoscale reconfigurability of this system, provides an interesting starting\npoint towards solid-state quantum simulation.\n", "  The Bazanski approach for deriving paths is applied to Finsler geometry. The\napproach is generalized and applied to a new developed geometry called\n\"Absolute parallelism with a Finslerian Flavor\" (FAP). A sets of path equations\nis derived for the FAP. This is the horizontal (h) set. A striking feature\nappears in this set, that is: the coefficient of torsion term, in the set,\njumps by a step of one-half from one equation to the other. This is tempting to\nbelieve that the h-set admits some quantum features. Comparisons with the\ncorresponding sets in other geometries are given. Conditions to reduce the set\nof path equations obtained, to well known path equations in some geometries are\nsummarized in a schematic diagram.\n", "  We investigate the continuum spectrum of the SU(2) gauge theory with $N_f=2$\nflavours of fermions in the fundamental representation. This model provides a\nminimal template which is ideal for a wide class of Standard Model extensions\nfeaturing novel strong dynamics that range from composite (Goldstone) Higgs\ntheories to several intriguing types of dark matter candidates, such as the\nSIMPs. We improve our previous lattice analysis [1] by adding more data at\nlight quark masses, at two additional lattice spacings, by determining the\nlattice cutoff via a Wilson flow measure of the $w_0$ parameter, and by\nmeasuring the relevant renormalisation constants non-perturbatively in the\nRI'-MOM scheme. Our results for the lightest isovector states in the vector and\naxial channels, in units of the pseudoscalar decay constant, are\n$m_V/F_{\\rm{PS}}\\sim 13.1(2.2)$ and $m_A/F_{\\rm{PS}}\\sim 14.5(3.6)$ (combining\nstatistical and systematic errors).\n  In the context of the composite (Goldstone) Higgs models, our result for the\nspin-one resonances are $m_V > 3.2(5)$ TeV and $m_A > 3.6(9)$ TeV, which are\nabove the current LHC constraints. In the context of dark matter models, for\nthe SIMP case our results indicate the occurrence of a compressed spectrum at\nthe required large dark pion mass, which implies the need to include the\neffects of spin-one resonances in phenomenological estimates.\n", "  We compute the $s-\\bar s$ asymmetry in the proton in chiral effective theory,\nusing phenomenological constraints based upon existing data. Unlike previous\nmeson cloud model calculations, which accounted for kaon loop contributions\nwith on-shell intermediate states alone, this work includes off-shell terms and\ncontact interactions, which impact the shape of the $s-\\bar s$ difference. We\nidentify a valence-like component of $s(x)$ which is balanced by a\n$\\delta$-function contribution to $\\bar s(x)$ at $x=0$, so that the integrals\nof $s$ and $\\bar s$ over the experimentally accessible region $x > 0$ are not\nequal. Using a regularization procedure that preserves chiral symmetry and\nLorentz invariance, we find that existing data limit the integrated value of\nthe second moment of the asymmetry to the range $-0.07 \\times 10^{-3} \\leq\n\\langle x(s-\\bar s) \\rangle \\leq 1.12 \\times 10^{-3}$ at a scale of $Q^2=1\n$GeV$^2$. This is too small to account for the NuTeV anomaly and of the wrong\nsign to enhance it.\n", "  Dark Matter (DM) models providing possible alternative solutions to the\nsmall- scale crisis of standard cosmology are nowadays of growing interest. We\nconsider DM interacting with light hidden fermions via well motivated\nfundamental operators showing the resultant matter power spectrum is suppressed\non subgalactic scales within a plausible parameter region. Our basic\ndescription of the evolution of cosmological perturbations relies on a fully\nconsistent first principles derivation of a perturbed Fokker-Planck type\nequation, generalizing existing literature. The cosmological perturbation of\nthe Fokker-Planck equation is presented for the first time in two different\ngauges, where the results transform into each other according to the rules of\ngauge transformation. Furthermore, our focus lies on a derivation of a broadly\napplicable and easily computable collision term showing important\nphenomenological differences to other existing approximations. As one of the\nmain results and concerning the small-scale crisis, we show the equal\nimportance of vector and scalar boson mediated interactions between DM and\nlight fermions.\n", "  Quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators possess edge states that are topologically\nprotected from backscattering. However, known QSH materials (e.g. HgTe/CdTe and\nInAs/GaSb quantum wells) exhibit very small energy gap and only work at low\ntemperature, hindering their applications for room temperature devices. Based\non the first-principles calculations, we predict a novel family of QSH\ninsulators in monolayer tantalum carbide halide TaCX (X = Cl, Br, and I) with\nunique rectangular lattice and large direct energy gaps larger than 0.2 eV,\naccurately, 0.23$-$0.36 eV. The mechanism for 2D QSH effect in this system\noriginates from a intrinsic d$-$d band inversion, different from conventional\nQSH systems with band inversion between s$-$p or p$-$p orbitals. Further, stain\nand intrinsic electric field can be used to tune the electronic structure and\nenhance the energy gap. TaCX nanoribbon, which has single-Dirac-cone edge\nstates crossing the bulk band gap, exhibits a linear dispersion with a high\nFermi velocity comparable to that of graphene. These 2D materials with\nconsiderable nontrivial gaps promise great application potential in the new\ngeneration of dissipationless electronics and spintronics.\n", "  Using low-redshift (z<0.09) samples of AGNs, normal galaxies and groups of\ngalaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we study the\nenvironments of type 1 and type 2 AGNs both on small and large scales.\nComparisons are made for galaxy samples matched in redshift, $r$-band\nluminosity, [OIII] luminosity, and also the position in groups (central or\nsatellite). We find that type 2 AGNs and normal galaxies reside in similar\nenvironments. Type 1 and type 2 AGNs have similar clustering properties on\nlarge scales ($\\gtrsim1$Mpc), but at scales smaller than 100 kpc, type 2s have\nsignificant more neighbors than type 1s ($3.09\\pm0.69$ times more for central\nAGNs at $\\lesssim30$kpc). These results suggest that type 1 and type 2 AGNs are\nhosted by halos of similar masses, as is also seen directly from the mass\ndistributions of their host groups ($\\sim10^{12}h^{-1} M_{\\odot}$ for centrals\nand $\\sim10^{13}h^{-1} M_{\\odot}$ for satellites). Type~2s have significantly\nmore satellites around them, and the distribution of their satellites is also\nmore centrally concentrated. The host galaxies of both types of AGNs have\nsimilar optical properties, but their infrared colors are significantly\ndifferent. Our results suggest that the simple unified model based solely on\ntorus orientation is not sufficient, but that galaxy interactions in dark\nmatter halos must have played an important role in the formation of the dust\nstructure that obscures AGNs.\n", "  The new generation of solar instruments provides better spectral, spatial,\nand temporal resolution for a better understanding of the physical processes\nthat take place on the Sun. Multiple-component profiles are more commonly\nobserved with these instruments. Particularly, the He I 10830 \\r{A} triplet\npresents such peculiar spectral profiles, which give information on the\nvelocity and magnetic fine structure of the upper chromosphere. The purpose of\nthis investigation is to describe a technique to efficiently fit the two\nblended components of the He I 10830 \\r{A} triplet, which are commonly observed\nwhen two atmospheric components are located within the same resolution element.\nThe observations used in this study were taken on 2015 April 17 with the very\nfast spectroscopic mode of the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS) attached to\nthe 1.5-meter GREGOR solar telescope, located at the Observatorio del Teide,\nTenerife, Spain. We apply a double-Lorentzian fitting technique using\nLevenberg-Marquardt least-squares minimization. This technique is very simple\nand much faster than inversion codes. Line-of-sight Doppler velocities can be\ninferred for a whole map of pixels within just a few minutes. Our results show\nsub- and supersonic downflow velocities of up to 32 km/s for the fast component\nin the vicinity of footpoints of filamentary structures. The slow component\npresents velocities close to rest.\n", "  Flies that walk in a covered planar arena on straight paths avoid colliding\nwith each other, but which of the two flies stops is not random.\nHigh-throughput video observations, coupled with dedicated experiments with\ncontrolled robot flies have revealed that flies utilize the type of optic flow\non their retina as a determinant of who should stop, a strategy also used by\nship captains to determine which of two ships on a collision course should\nthrow engines in reverse. We use digital evolution to test whether this\nstrategy evolves when collision avoidance is the sole penalty. We find that the\nstrategy does indeed evolve in a narrow range of cost/benefit ratios, for\nexperiments in which the \"regressive motion\" cue is error free. We speculate\nthat these stringent conditions may not be sufficient to evolve the strategy in\nreal flies, pointing perhaps to auxiliary costs and benefits not modeled in our\nstudy\n", "  Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the most dynamic phenomena in our solar\nsystem. They abruptly disrupt the continuous outflow of solar wind by expelling\nhuge clouds of magnetized plasma into interplanetary space with velocities\nenabling to cross the Sun-Earth distance within a few days. Earth-directed CMEs\nmay cause severe geomagnetic storms when their embedded magnetic fields and the\nshocks ahead compress and reconnect with the Earth's magnetic field. The\ntransit times and impacts in detail depend on the initial CME velocity, size,\nand mass, as well as on the conditions and coupling processes with the ambient\nsolar wind flow in interplanetary space. The observed CME parameters may be\nseverly affected by projection effects and the constant changing environmental\nconditions are hard to derive. This makes it difficult to fully understand the\nphysics behind CME evolution, preventing to do a reliable forecast of\nEarth-directed events. This short review focusing on observational data, shows\nrecent methods which were developed to derive the CME kinematical profile for\nthe entire Sun-Earth distance range as well as studies which were performed to\nshed light on the physical processes that CMEs encounter when propagating from\nSun to Earth.\n", "  Out-of-equilibrium systems can host phenomena that transcend the usual\nrestrictions of equilibrium systems. Here we unveil how out-of-equilibrium\nstates, prepared via a quantum quench, can exhibit a non-zero Hall-type\nresponse that persists at long times, and even when the instantaneous\nHamiltonian is time reversal symmetric; both these features starkly contrast\nwith equilibrium Hall currents. Interestingly, the persistent Hall effect\narises from processes beyond those captured by linear response, and is a\nsignature of the novel dynamics in out-of-equilibrium systems. We propose\nquenches in two-band Dirac systems as natural venues to realize persistent Hall\ncurrents, which exist when either mirror or time-reversal symmetry are broken\n(before or after the quench). Its long time persistence, as well as sensitivity\nto symmetry breaking, allow it to be used as a sensitive diagnostic of the\ncomplex out-equilibrium dynamics readily controlled and probed in cold-atomic\noptical lattice experiments.\n", "  The formation and evolution of galaxies with low neutral atomic hydrogen (HI)\nmasses, M$_{\\rm HI}$$<$10$^{8}h^{-2}$M$_{\\odot}$, are affected by host dark\nmatter halo mass and photoionisation feedback from the UV background after the\nend of reionization. We study how the physical processes governing the\nformation of galaxies with low HI mass are imprinted on the distribution of\nneutral hydrogen in the Universe using the hierarchical galaxy formation model,\nGALFORM. We calculate the effect on the correlation function of changing the HI\nmass detection threshold at redshifts $0 \\le z \\le 0.5$. We parameterize the\nclustering as $\\xi(r)=(r/r_{0})^{-\\gamma}$ and we find that including galaxies\nwith M$_{\\rm HI}$$<$10$^{8}h^{-2}$M$_{\\odot}$ increases the clustering\namplitude $r_{0}$ and slope $\\gamma$ compared to samples of higher HI masses.\nThis is due to these galaxies with low HI masses typically being hosted by\nhaloes with masses greater than 10$^{12}{h}^{-1}$M$_{\\odot}$, and is in\ncontrast to optically selected surveys for which the inclusion of faint, blue\ngalaxies lowers the clustering amplitude. We show the HI mass function for\ndifferent host dark matter halo masses and galaxy types (central or satellite)\nto interpret the values of $r_{0}$ and $\\gamma$ of the clustering of\nHI-selected galaxies. We also predict the contribution of low HI mass galaxies\nto the 21cm intensity mapping signal. We calculate that a dark matter halo mass\nresolution better than $\\sim$10$^{10}{h}^{-1}$M$_{\\odot}$ at redshifts higher\nthan 0.5 is required in order to predict converged 21cm brightness temperature\nfluctuations.\n", "  We focus on the evidence of a past minor merger discovered in the halo of the\nAndromeda galaxy (M31). Previous N-body studies have enjoyed moderate success\nin producing the observed giant stellar stream (GSS) and stellar shells in\nM31's halo. The observed distribution of stars in the halo of M31 shows an\nasymmetric surface brightness profile across the GSS; however, the effect of\nthe morphology of the progenitor galaxy on the internal structure of the GSS\nrequires further investigation in theoretical studies. To investigate the\nphysical connection between the characteristic surface brightness in the GSS\nand the morphology of the progenitor dwarf galaxy, we systematically vary the\nthickness, rotation velocity and initial inclination of the disc dwarf galaxy\nin N-body simulations. The formation of the observed structures appears to be\ndominated by the progenitor's rotation. Besides reproducing the observed GSS\nand two shells in detail, we predict additional structures for further\nobservations. We predict the detectability of the progenitor's stellar core in\nthe phase-space density distribution, azimuthal metallicity gradient of the\nwestern shell-like structure and an additional extended shell in the\nnorth-western direction that may constrain the properties of the progenitor\ngalaxy.\n", "  Solar jets are fast-moving, elongated brightenings related to ejections seen\nin both images and spectra on all scales from barely visible chromospheric jets\nto coronal jets extending up to a few solar radii. The largest, most powerful\njets are the source of type III radio bursts, energetic electrons and ions with\ngreatly enhanced $^3$He and heavy element abundances. The frequent coronal jets\nfrom polar and equatorial coronal holes may contribute to the solar wind. The\nprimary acceleration mechanism for all jets is believed to be release of\nmagnetic stress via reconnection; however the energy buildup depends on the\njets' source environment. In this review, we discuss how certain features of\nX-ray and EUV jets, such as their repetition rate and association with radio\nemission, depends on their underlying photospheric field configurations (active\nregions, polar and equatorial coronal holes, and quiet Sun).\n", "  Topological insulators have been proposed to be best characterized as bulk\nmagnetoelectric materials that show response functions quantized in terms of\nfundamental physical constants. Here we lower the chemical potential of\nthree-dimensional (3D) Bi$_2$Se$_3$ films to $\\sim$ 30 meV above the Dirac\npoint, and probe their low-energy electrodynamic response in the presence of\nmagnetic fields with high-precision time-domain terahertz polarimetry. For\nfields higher than 5 T, we observed quantized Faraday and Kerr rotations,\nwhereas the DC transport is still semi-classical. A non-trivial Berry phase\noffset to these values gives evidence for axion electrodynamics and the\ntopological magnetoelectric effect. The time structure used in these\nmeasurements allows a direct measure of the fine structure constant based on a\ntopological invariant of a solid-state system.\n", "  We consider a spherically symmetric (magnetic) $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills field\npropagating on the exterior of the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole.\nTaking advantage of the conformal symmetry, we reduce the problem to the study\nof the Yang-Mills equation in a geodesically complete spacetime with two\nasymptotically flat ends. We prove the existence of infinitely many static\nsolutions (two of which are found in closed form) and determine the spectrum of\ntheir linear perturbations and quasinormal modes. Finally, using the\nhyperboloidal approach to the initial value problem, we describe the process of\nrelaxation to the static endstates of evolution for various initial data.\n", "  We use Local Group galaxy counts together with the ELVIS N-body simulations\nto explore the relationship between the scatter and slope in the stellar mass\nvs. halo mass relation at low masses, $M_\\star \\simeq 10^5 - 10^8 M_\\odot$.\nAssuming models with log-normal scatter about a median relation of the form\n$M_\\star \\propto M_\\mathrm{halo}^\\alpha$, the preferred log-slope steepens from\n$\\alpha \\simeq 1.8$ in the limit of zero scatter to $\\alpha \\simeq 2.6$ in the\ncase of $2$ dex of scatter in $M_\\star$ at fixed halo mass. We provide fitting\nfunctions for the best-fit relations as a function of scatter, including cases\nwhere the relation becomes increasingly stochastic with decreasing mass. We\nshow that if the scatter at fixed halo mass is large enough ($\\gtrsim 1$ dex)\nand if the median relation is steep enough ($\\alpha \\gtrsim 2$), then the\n\"too-big-to-fail\" problem seen in the Local Group can be self-consistently\neliminated in about $\\sim 5-10\\%$ of realizations. This scenario requires that\nthe most massive subhalos host unobservable ultra-faint dwarfs fairly often; we\ndiscuss potentially observable signatures of these systems. Finally, we compare\nour derived constraints to recent high-resolution simulations of dwarf galaxy\nformation in the literature. Though simulation-to-simulation scatter in\n$M_\\star$ at fixed $M_\\mathrm{halo}$ is large among separate authors ($\\sim 2$\ndex), individual codes produce relations with much less scatter and usually\ngive relations that would over-produce local galaxy counts.\n", "  TARA (Telescope Array Radar) is a cosmic ray radar detection experiment\ncolocated with Telescope Array, the conventional surface scintillation detector\n(SD) and fluorescence telescope detector (FD) near Delta, Utah, U.S.A. The TARA\ndetector combines a 40 kW, 54.1 MHz VHF transmitter and high-gain transmitting\nantenna which broadcasts the radar carrier over the SD array and within the FD\nfield of view, towards a 250 MS/s DAQ receiver. TARA has been collecting data\nsince 2013 with the primary goal of observing the radar signatures of extensive\nair showers (EAS). Simulations indicate that echoes are expected to be short in\nduration (~10 microseconds) and exhibit rapidly changing frequency, with rates\non the order of 1 MHz/microsecond. The EAS radar cross-section (RCS) is\ncurrently unknown although it is the subject of over 70 years of speculation. A\nnovel signal search technique is described in which the expected radar echo of\na particular air shower is used as a matched filter template and compared to\nwaveforms obtained by triggering the radar DAQ using the Telescope Array\nfluorescence detector. No evidence for the scattering of radio frequency\nradiation by EAS is obtained to date. We report the first quantitative RCS\nupper limits using EAS that triggered the Telescope Array Fluorescence\nDetector.\n", "  Efimov physics is renowned for the self-similar spectrum featuring the\nuniversal ratio of one eigenenergy to its neighbor. Even more esoteric is the\nnumerically unveiled fact that every Efimov trimer is accompanied by a pair of\ntetramers. Here we demonstrate that this hierarchy of universal few-body\nclusters has a topological origin by identifying the numbers of universal 3-\nand 4-body bound states with the winding numbers of the renormalization-group\nlimit cycle in theory space. The finding suggests a topological phase\ntransition in mass-imbalanced few-body systems which should be tested\nexperimentally.\n", "  Two dimensional tensor networks such as projected entangled pairs states\n(PEPS) are generally hard to contract. This is arguably the main reason why\nvariational tensor network methods in 2D are still not as successful as in 1D.\nHowever, this is not necessarily the case if the tensor network represents a\ngapped ground state of a local Hamiltonian; such states are subject to many\nconstraints and contain much more structure. In this paper we introduce a new\napproach for approximating the expectation value of a local observable in\nground states of local Hamiltonians that are represented as PEPS\ntensor-networks. Instead of contracting the full tensor-network, we try to\nestimate the expectation value using only a local patch of the tensor-network\naround the observable. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that this is often easier\nto do when the system is frustrated. In such case, the spanning vectors of the\nlocal patch are subject to non-trivial constraints that can be utilized via a\nsemi-definite program to calculate rigorous lower- and upper-bounds on the\nexpectation value. We test our approach in 1D systems, where we show how the\nexpectation value can be calculated up to at least 3 or 4 digits of precision,\neven when the patch radius is smaller than the correlation length.\n", "  We study the masses of open charm and bottom tetraquark states within the\ndiquark-antidiquark scenario in the relativized quark model proposed by Godfrey\nand Isgur. The diquark and antidiquark masses are firstly solved by relativized\nquark potential, and then treated as the usual antiquark and quark,\nrespectively. The masses of tetraquark states are obtained by solving the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger-type equation between the new diquark and antidiquark. We find\nthe masses of $sq\\bar b\\bar q$ tetraquark configuration are much higher than\nthat of $X(5568)$. This conclusion disfavors the possibility of $X(5568)$ as a\ntetraquark state within the diquark-antidiquark scenario. Further experimental\nsearches are needed to clarify the nature of the signal observed by D0\ncollaboration.\n", "  This article is based on an invited talk given by V. P. Kulkarni at the 8th\nCosmic Dust meeting. Dust has a profound effect on the physics and chemistry of\nthe interstellar gas in galaxies and on the appearance of galaxies.\nUnderstanding the cosmic evolution of dust with time is therefore crucial for\nunderstanding the evolution of galaxies. Despite the importance of interstellar\ndust, very little is known about its nature and composition in distant\ngalaxies. We summarize the results of our ongoing programs using observations\nof distant quasars to obtain better constraints on dust grains in foreground\ngalaxies that happen to lie along the quasar sightlines. These observations\nconsist of a combination of mid-infrared data obtained with the Spitzer Space\nTelescope and optical/UV data obtained with ground-based telescopes and/or the\nHubble Space Telescope. The mid-IR data target the 10 $\\mu$m and 18 $\\mu$m\nsilicate absorption features, while the optical/UV data allow determinations of\nelement depletions, extinction curves, 2175 {\\AA} bumps, etc. Measurements of\nsuch properties in absorption-selected galaxies with redshifts ranging from\n$z\\sim0$ to $z>2$ provide constraints on the evolution of interstellar dust\nover the past $> 10$ Gyr. The optical depth of the 10 $\\mu$m silicate\nabsorption feature ($\\tau_{10}$) in these galaxies is correlated with the\namount of reddening along the sightline. But there are indications [e.g., based\non the $\\tau_{10}$ /$E(B-V)$ ratio and possible grain crystallinity] that the\ndust in these distant galaxies differs in structure and composition from the\ndust in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds. We briefly discuss the\nimplications of these results for the evolution of galaxies and their star\nformation history.\n", "  (abridged) We present cosmological constraints obtained from galaxy clusters\nidentified by their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect signature in the 2500 square\ndegree South Pole Telescope Sunyaev Zel'dovich survey. We consider the 377\ncluster candidates identified at z>0.25 with a detection significance greater\nthan five, corresponding to the 95% purity threshold for the survey. We compute\nconstraints on cosmological models using the measured cluster abundance as a\nfunction of mass and redshift. We include additional constraints from\nmulti-wavelength observations, including Chandra X-ray data for 82 clusters and\na weak lensing-based prior on the normalization of the mass-observable scaling\nrelations. Assuming a LCDM cosmology, where the species-summed neutrino mass\nhas the minimum allowed value (mnu = 0.06 eV) from neutrino oscillation\nexperiments, we combine the cluster data with a prior on H0 and find sigma_8 =\n0.797+-0.031 and Omega_m = 0.289+-0.042, with the parameter combination\nsigma_8(Omega_m/0.27)^0.3 = 0.784+-0.039. These results are in good agreement\nwith constraints from the CMB from SPT, WMAP, and Planck, as well as with\nconstraints from other cluster datasets. Adding mnu as a free parameter, we\nfind mnu = 0.14+-0.08 eV when combining the SPT cluster data with Planck CMB\ndata and BAO data, consistent with the minimum allowed value. Finally, we\nconsider a cosmology where mnu and N_eff are fixed to the LCDM values, but the\ndark energy equation of state parameter w is free. Using the SPT cluster data\nin combination with an H0 prior, we measure w = -1.28+-0.31, a constraint\nconsistent with the LCDM cosmological model and derived from the combination of\ngrowth of structure and geometry. When combined with primarily geometrical\nconstraints from Planck CMB, H0, BAO and SNe, adding the SPT cluster data\nimproves the w constraint from the geometrical data alone by 14%, to w =\n-1.023+-0.042.\n", "  Real photon-photon scattering is a long-predicted phenomenon that is being\nsearched for in experiment in the form of a birefringent vacuum at optical and\nX-ray frequencies. We present results of calculations and numerical simulations\nfor a scenario to measure this effect using multi-MeV photons generated in the\ncollision of electrons with a laser pulse. We find that the birefringence of\nthe vacuum should be measurable using experimental parameters attainable in the\nnear future.\n", "  Decades ago, the losses of glasses in the near infrared (near-IR) were\ninvestigated in views of developments for optical telecommunications. Today,\nproperties in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) are of interest for molecular\nspectroscopy applications. In particular, high-sensitivity spectroscopic\ntechniques based on high-finesse mid-IR cavities hold high promise for medical\napplications. Due to exceptional purity and low losses, whispering gallery mode\nmicroresonators based on polished alkaline earth metal fluoride crystals (i.e\nthe $\\mathrm{XF_2}$ family, where X $=$ Ca, Mg, Ba, Sr,...) have attained\nultra-high quality (Q) factor resonances (Q$>$10$^{8}$) in the near-IR and\nvisible spectral ranges. Here we report for the first time ultra-high Q factors\nin the mid-IR using crystalline microresonators. Using an uncoated chalcogenide\n(ChG) tapered fiber, light from a continuous wave quantum cascade laser (QCL)\nis efficiently coupled to several crystalline microresonators at 4.4 $\\mu$m\nwavelength. We measure the optical Q factor of fluoride crystals in the mid-IR\nusing cavity ringdown technique. We observe that $\\mathrm{MgF_2}$\nmicroresonators feature quality factors that are very close to the fundamental\nabsorption limit, as caused by the crystal's multiphonon absorption\n(Q$\\sim$10$^{7}$), in contrast to near-IR measurements far away from these\nfundamental limits. Due to lower multiphonon absorption in $\\mathrm{BaF_2}$ and\n$\\mathrm{SrF_2}$, we show that ultra-high quality factors of Q $\\geqslant$ 1.4\n$\\times 10^{8}$ can be reached at 4.4 $\\mu$m. This corresponds to an optical\nfinesse of $\\mathcal{F}>$4$\\cdot$ 10$^{4}$, the highest value achieved for any\ntype of mid-IR resonator to date, and a more than 10-fold improvement over the\nstate-of-the-art. Such compact ultra-high Q crystalline microresonators provide\na route for narrow linewidth frequency-stabilized QCL or mid-IR Kerr comb\ngeneration.\n", "  This paper completes the construction of arbitrary order conformally\ninvariant differential operators in higher spin spaces. Jan Slov\\'{a}k has\nclassified all conformally invariant differential operators on locally\nconformally flat manifolds. We complete his results in higher spin theory by\ngiving explicit expressions for arbitrary order conformally invariant\ndifferential operators, where by conformally invariant we mean equivariant with\nrespect to the conformal group of $\\mathbb{S}^m$ acting in Euclidean space\n$\\mathbb{R}^m$. We name these the fermionic operators when the order is odd and\nbosonic operators when the order is even. Our approach explicitly uses\nconvolution type operators to construct conformally invariant differential\noperators. These convolution type operators are examples of Knapp-Stein\noperators and they can be considered as the inverses of the corresponding\ndifferential operators. Intertwining operators of these convolution type\noperators are provided and intertwining operators of differential operators\nfollow immediately. This reveals that our convolution type operators and\ndifferential operators are all conformally invariant. This also gives us a\nclass of conformally invariant convolution type operators in higher spin\nspaces. Their inverses, when they exist, are conformally invariant\npseudo-differential operators. Further we use Stein Weiss gradient operators\nand representation theory for the Spin group to naturally motivate the\nRarita-Schwinger operators.\n", "  Multilayer networks have been the subject of intense research during the last\nfew years, as they represent better the interdependent nature of many real\nworld systems. Here, we address the question of describing the three different\nstructural phases in which a multiplex network might exist. We show that each\nphase can be characterized by the presence of gaps in the spectrum of the\nsupra-Laplacian of the multiplex network. We therefore unveil the existence of\ndifferent topological scales in the system, whose relation characterizes each\nphase. Moreover, by capitalizing on the coarse-grained representation that is\ngiven in terms of quotient graphs, we explain the mechanisms that produce those\ngaps as well as their dynamical consequences.\n", "  It has been proposed that mixing induced by convective overshoot can disrupt\nthe inward propagation of carbon deflagrations in super-asymptotic giant branch\nstars. To test this theory, we study an idealized model of convectively bounded\ncarbon flames with 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the Boussinesq equations\nusing the pseudospectral code Dedalus. Because the flame propagation timescale\nis much longer than the convection timescale, we approximate the flame as fixed\nin space, and only consider its effects on the buoyancy of the fluid. By\nevolving a passive scalar field, we derive a {\\it turbulent} chemical\ndiffusivity produced by the convection as a function of height, $D_{\\rm t}(z)$.\nConvection can stall a flame if the chemical mixing timescale, set by the\nturbulent chemical diffusivity, $D_{\\rm t}$, is shorter than the flame\npropagation timescale, set by the thermal diffusivity, $\\kappa$, i.e., when\n$D_{\\rm t}>\\kappa$. However, we find $D_{\\rm t}<\\kappa$ for most of the flame\nbecause convective plumes are not dense enough to penetrate into the flame.\nExtrapolating to realistic stellar conditions, this implies that convective\nmixing cannot stall a carbon flame and that \"hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon\" white\ndwarfs are not a typical product of stellar evolution.\n", "  Gravitational collapse of a massive primordial gas cloud is thought to be a\npromising path for the formation of supermassive blackholes in the early\nuniverse. We study conditions for the so-called direct collapse (DC) blackhole\nformation in a fully cosmological context. We combine a semianalytic model of\nearly galaxy formation with halo merger trees constructed from dark matter\n$N$-body simulations. We locate a total of 68 possible DC sites in a volume of\n$20\\;h^{-1}\\;\\mathrm{Mpc}$ on a side. We then perform hydrodynamics simulations\nfor 42 selected halos to study in detail the evolution of the massive clouds\nwithin them. We find only two successful cases where the gas clouds rapidly\ncollapse to form stars. In the other cases, gravitational collapse is prevented\nby the tidal force exerted by a nearby massive halo, which otherwise should\nserve as a radiation source necessary for DC. Ram pressure stripping disturbs\nthe cloud approaching the source. In many cases, a DC halo and its nearby light\nsource halo merge before the onset of cloud collapse. Only when the DC halo is\nassembled through major mergers, the gas density increases rapidly to trigger\ngravitational instability. Based on our cosmological simulations, we conclude\nthat the event rate of DC is an order of magnitude smaller than reported in\nprevious studies, although the absolute rate is still poorly constrained. It is\nnecessary to follow the dynamical evolution of a DC cloud and its nearby\nhalo(s) in order to determine the critical radiation flux for DC.\n", "  The transverse stability of the target is crucial for obtaining high quality\nion beams using the laser radiation pressure acceleration (RPA) mechanism. In\nthis letter, a theoretical model and supporting two-dimensional (2D)\nParticle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations are presented to clarify the physical\nmechanism of the transverse instability observed in the RPA process. It is\nshown that the density ripples of the target foil are mainly induced by the\ncoupling between the transverse oscillating electrons and the quasi-static\nions, a mechanism similar to the transverse two stream instability in the\ninertial confinement fusion (ICF) research. The predictions of the mode\nstructure and the growth rates from the theory agree well with the results\nobtained from the PIC simulations in various regimes, indicating the model\ncontains the essence of the underlying physics of the transverse break-up of\nthe target.\n", "  We present a method for determining the purely imaginary quasinormal modes of\nthe Kerr geometry. Such modes have previously been explored, but we show that\nprior results are incorrect. The method we present, based on the theory of Heun\npolynomials, is very general and can be applied to a broad class of problems,\nmaking it potentially useful to all branches of physics. Furthermore, our\napplication provides an example where the method of matched asymptotic\nexpansions seems to have failed. A deeper understanding of why it fails in this\ncase may provide useful insights for other situations.\n", "  We present an attempt to extract information about the comet 9P/Tempel 1\nnucleus from the characteristics of the ejecta cloud produced by the impactor\nof the Deep Impact mission. For this purpose we use two techniques. We first\nstudy the shadow cast on the nucleus surface by the ejecta cloud and\ninvestigate how areas of different brightness are related to the varying\noptical thickness or albedo of the ejecta cloud. The shadow was seen during the\nfirst 2.0 seconds after the impact (afterward it became obscured by the ejecta\ncloud). We have found that all brightness variations in the shadow are the\nresult of the surface inhomogeneities, indicating that during first 2.0 seconds\nthe ejecta cloud was homogeneous within the MRI spatial resolution. Our second\ntechnique is to study the obscuration of the nucleus limb by the ejecta. This\nstudy covers the period 0.76- 68.8 seconds after impact and is based on\ncomparison of the ejecta cloud brightness on the limb and just beyond the limb.\nAt this stage we do see inhomogeneities in the ejecta cloud that relate to the\nalbedo and optical thickness variations in the ejected dust. Specifically, we\nhave found two distinct bands of low optical thickness and one band of a high\noptical thickness. Based on crater formation ideas we estimate the depth of\nexcavation of the ejected material for the found inhomogeneities and, thus,\ndefine a potential layering structure for the comet nucleus, Our estimates\nsuggest that the low-optical thickness material was excavated from a depth of\n15-18 and 30-32 meters in the case the porous nucleus material and 37-46 and\n87-93 meters in the case of a non-porous nucleus material, and a layer of high\noptical thickness originated from the depth 9-11 m for porous material or 20-23\nm for non-porous material. Based on the crater diameter estimates, we expect\nthat the real depth of the layers is between these two cases.\n", "  We consider two protocols for the measurement of the temporal correlation\nfunctions of a dichotomic variable Q appearing in Leggett-Garg type\ninequalities. The protocols measure solely whether Q has the same or different\nsign at the ends of a given time interval. They are inspired, in part, by a\ndecoherent histories analysis of the two-time histories of Q although the\nprotocols are ultimately expressed in macrorealistic form independent of\nquantum theory. The first type involves an ancilla coupled to the system with\ntwo sequential CNOT gates, and the two-time histories of the system are\ndetermined in a single final time measurement of the ancilla. It is\nnon-invasive for special choices of initial system states and partially\ninvasive for more general choices. Modified Leggett-Garg type inequalities\nwhich accommodate the partial invasiveness are discussed. The quantum picture\nof the protocol shows that for certain choices of primary system initial state\nthe protocol is undetectable with respect to final system state measurements,\nalthough it is still invasive at intermediate times. This invasiveness can be\nreduced with different choices of ancilla states and the protocol is then\nsimilar in flavour to a weak measurement. The second type of protocol is based\non the fact that the behaviour of Q over a time interval can be determined from\nknowledge of the dynamics together with a measurement of certain initial (or\nfinal) data. Its quantum version corresponds to the known fact that when sets\nof histories are decoherent, their probabilities may be expressed in terms of a\nrecord projector, hence the two-time histories in which Q has the same or\ndifferent sign can be determined by a single projective measurement. The\nresulting protocol resembles the decay-type protocol proposed by Huelga and\ncollaborators (which is non-invasive but requires a stationarity assumption).\n", "  Gas giants orbiting their host star within the ice line are thought to have\nmigrated to their current locations from farther out. Here we consider the\norigin and dynamical evolution of observed Jupiters, focusing on hot and warm\nJupiters with outer friends. We show that the majority of the observed Jupiter\npairs (twenty out of twenty-four) will be dynamically unstable if the inner\nplanet was placed at >~1AU distance from the stellar host. This finding is at\nodds with formation theories that invoke the migration of such planets from\nsemi-major axes >~1AU due to secular dynamical processes (e.g., secular chaos,\nLidov-Kozai oscillations) coupled with tidal dissipation. In fact, the results\nof N-body integrations show that the evolution of dynamically unstable systems\ndoes not lead to tidal migration but rather to planet ejections and collisions\nwith the host star. This and other arguments lead us to suggest that most of\nthe observed planets with a companion could not have been transported from\nfurther out through secular migration processes. More generally, by using a\ncombination of numerical and analytic techniques we show that the high-e\nLidov-Kozai migration scenario can only account for less than 10% of all gas\ngiants observed between 0.1-1 AU. Simulations of multi-planet systems support\nthis result. Our study indicates that rather than starting on highly eccentric\norbits with orbital periods above one year, these \"warm\" Jupiters are more\nlikely to have reached the region where they are observed today without having\nexperienced significant tidal dissipation.\n", "  An analysis of negative radiative feedback from resident stars in minihalos\nis performed. It is found that the most effective mechanism to suppress star\nformation is provided by infrared photons from resident stars via\nphoto-detachment of ${\\rm H^-}$. It is shown that a stringent upper bound on\n(total stellar mass, metallicity) of ($\\sim 1000{\\rm M_\\odot}$, $-3.3\\pm 0.2$)\nin any newly minted atomic cooling halo can be placed, with the actual values\npossibly significantly lower. This has both important physical ramifications on\nformation of stars and supermassive black seeds in atomic cooling halos at high\nredshift, pertaining to processes of low temperature metal cooling, dust\nformation and fragmentation, and direct consequences on the faint end galaxy\nluminosity function at high redshift and cosmological reionization. The\nluminosity function of galaxies at the epoch of reionization may be\nsubstantially affected due to the combined effect of a diminished role of\nminihalos and an enhanced contribution from Pop III stars in atomic cooling\nhalos. Upcoming results on reionization optical depth from Planck\nHigh-Frequency Instrument data may provide a significant constraint on and a\nunique probe of this star formation physical process in minihalos. As a\nnumerical example, in the absence of significant contributions from minihalos\nwith virial masses below $1.5\\times 10^{8}{\\rm M_\\odot}$ the reionization\noptical depth is expected to be no greater than $0.065$, whereas allowing for\nminihalos of masses as low as ($10^7{\\rm M_\\odot}$, $10^{6.5}{\\rm M_\\odot}$) to\nform stars unconstrained by this self-regulation physical process, the\nreionization optical depth is expected to exceed $(0.075,0.085)$, respectively.\n", "  A reanalysis of unpolarized electron-proton elastic scattering data is done\nin terms of the electric to magnetic form factor squared ratio. This observable\nis in principle more robust against experimental correlations and global\nnormalizations. The present analysis shows indeed that it is a useful quantity\nthat contains reliable and coherent information. The comparison with the ratio\nextracted from the measurement of the longitudinal to transverse polarization\nof the recoil proton in polarized electron-proton scattering shows that the\nresults are compatible within the experimental errors. Limits are set on the\nkinematics where the physical information on the form factors can be safely\nextracted. The results presented in this work bring a decisive piece of\ninformation to the controversy on the deviation of the proton form factors from\nthe dipole dependence.\n", "  We obtain the covariant propagator at finite temperature for interacting\nbaryons immersed in a strong magnetic field. The effect of the intrinsic\nmagnetic moments on the Green function are fully taken into account. We make an\nexpansion in terms of eigenfunctions of a Dirac field, which leads us to a\ncompact form of its propagator. We present some simple applications of these\npropagators, where the statistical averages of nuclear currents and energy\ndensity are evaluated.\n", "  We investigate invariant canonical transformations of a spatially covariant\nscalar-tensor theory of gravity, called the XG theory, by which the action or\nthe Hamiltonian and the primary constraints keep their forms invariant. We\nderive the Hamiltonian in a non perturbative manner and complete the\nHamiltonian analysis for all regions of the theory. We confirm that the theory\nhas at most 3 degrees of freedom in all regions of the theory as long as the\ntheory has the symmetry under the spatial diffeormorphism. Then, we derive the\ninvariant canonical transformation by using the infinitesimal transformation.\nThe invariant metric transformation of the XG theory contains a vector product\nas well as the disformal transformation. The vector product and the disformal\nfactor can depend on the higher order derivative terms of the scalar field and\nthe metric. In addition, we discover the invariant canonical transformation\nwhich transforms the momentum of the metric. Using the invariant\ntransformation, we study the relation between the Horndeski theory and the GLPV\ntheory, and find that we can not obtain the arbitrary GLPV theory from the\nHorndeski theory through the invariant canonical transformation we have found.\n", "  We explore the relic abundance of asymmetric Dark Matter in shear--dominated\nuniverse in which it is assumed the universe is expanded anisotropically. The\nmodified expansion rate leaves its imprint on the relic density of asymmetric\nDark Matter particles if the asymmetric Dark Matter particles are decoupled in\nshear dominated era. We found the relic abundances for particle and\nanti--particle are increased. The particle and anti--particle abundances are\nalmost in the same amount for the larger value of the shear factor $x_e$ which\nmakes the indirect detection possible for asymmetric Dark Matter. We use the\npresent day Dark Matter density from the observation to find the constraints on\nthe parameter space in this model.\n", "  The Fundamental Plane (FP) describes the relation between the stellar mass,\nsize, and velocity dispersion of elliptical galaxies; the Faber-Jackson\nrelation (FJR) is its projection onto {mass, velocity} space. In this work we\nredeploy and expand the framework of Desmond & Wechsler (2015) to ask whether\nabundance matching-based LCDM models that have shown success in matching the\nspatial distribution of galaxies are also capable of explaining key properties\nof the FJR and FP, including their scatter. Within our framework, agreement\nwith the normalisation of the FJR requires haloes to expand in response to disc\nformation. We find that the tilt of the FP may be explained by a combination of\nthe observed non-homology in galaxy structure and the variation in\nmass-to-light ratio produced by abundance matching with a universal initial\nmass function (IMF), provided that the anisotropy of stellar motions is taken\ninto account. However, the predicted scatter around the FP is considerably\nincreased by situating galaxies in cosmologically-motivated haloes due to\nvariations in halo properties at fixed stellar mass, and appears to exceed that\nof the data. This implies that additional correlations between galaxy and halo\nvariables may be required to fully reconcile these models with elliptical\ngalaxy scaling relations.\n", "  Recent ALMA observation has revealed multiple ring structures formed in a\nprotoplanetary disk around HL Tau. Prior to the ALMA observation of HL Tau,\ntheoretical analysis of secular gravitational instability (GI) described a\npossible formation of multiple ring structures with separations of 13 AU around\na radius of 100 AU in protoplanetary disks under certain conditions. In this\narticle, we reanalyze the viability of secular GI by adopting the physical\nvalues inferred from the observations. We derive the radial distributions of\nthe most unstable wavelength and the growth timescale of secular GI and verify\nthat secular GI can form the ring structures observed in HL Tau. When a\nturbulent viscosity coefficient $\\alpha$ remains small in inner region of the\ndisk, secular GI grows in the whole disk. Thus, the formation of planetary mass\nobjects should occur first in the inner region as a result of gravitational\nfragmentation after the non-linear growth of secular GI. In this case,\nresulting objects are expected to create the gaps at $r$ ~ 10 AU and ~ 30 AU.\nAs a result, all ring structures in HL Tau can be created by secular GI. If\nthis scenario is realized in HL Tau, the outer region corresponds to the\nearlier growth phase of the most unstable mode of secular GI, and the inner\nregion corresponds to the outcome of the non-linear growth of secular GI.\nTherefore, this interpretation suggests that we are possibly witnessing both\nthe beginning and end of planet formation in HL Tau.\n", "  We propose and study a holographic dual of the type IIB superstring theory of\nAdS_5 x S^5 in terms of the N=4 superconformal Yang-Mills theory on dS_4. We\nuse the bulk to boundary formalism to evaluate the boundary correlation\nfunctions and verify that it agrees with the expected result in dS conformal\nfield theory. The gauge theory is expected to be UV finite and enjoy exact\nSL(2,Z) strong-weak duality. As the string theory Green-Schwarz sigma model\ncarries an infinite number of classically conserved charges, it also suggest\nthat the superconformal Yang-Mills theory is integrable and deserves further\nstudies.\n", "  Brassard et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96, 250401 (2006)] showed that shared\nnonlocal boxes with the CHSH probability greater than $\\frac{3+\\sqrt{6}}6$\nyields trivial communication complexity. There still exists the gap with the\nmaximum CHSH probability $\\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}}4$ achievable by quantum mechanics.\nIt is an interesting open question to determine the exact threshold for the\ntrivial communication complexity. Brassard et al.'s idea is based on the\nrecursive bias amplification by the 3-input majority function. It was not\nobvious if other choice of function exhibits stronger bias amplification. We\nshow that the 3-input majority function is the unique optimal, so that one\ncannot improve the threshold $\\frac{3+\\sqrt{6}}6$ by Brassard et al.'s bias\namplification. In this work, protocols for computing the function used for the\nbias amplification are restricted to be non-adaptive protocols or particular\nadaptive protocol inspired by Paw{\\l}owski et al.'s protocol for information\ncausality [Nature 461, 1101 (2009)]. We first show a new adaptive protocol\ninspired by Paw{\\l}owski et al.'s protocol, and then show that the new adaptive\nprotocol is better than any non-adaptive protocol. Finally, we show that the\n3-input majority function is the unique optimal for the bias amplification if\nwe apply the new adaptive protocol to each step of the bias amplification.\n", "  We present pump-probe measurements of an all-optical photonic crystal switch\nbased on a nanocavity, resolving fast coherent temporal dynamics. The\nmeasurements demonstrate the importance of coherent effects typically neglected\nwhen considering nanocavity dynamics. In particular, we report the observation\nof an idler pulse. The measurements are in good agreement with a theoretical\nmodel that allows us to ascribe the observation to oscillations of the free\ncarrier population in the nanocavity. The effect opens perspectives for the\nrealization of new all-optical photonic crystal switches with unprecedented\nswitching contrast.\n", "  We examine the properties of atomic hydrogen (HI) associated with galaxies in\nthe EAGLE simulations of galaxy formation. EAGLE's feedback parameters were\ncalibrated to reproduce the stellar mass function and galaxy sizes at $z=0.1$,\nand we assess whether this calibration also yields realistic HI properties. We\nestimate the self-shielding density with a fitting function calibrated using\nradiation transport simulations, and correct for molecular hydrogen with\nempirical or theoretical relations. The `standard-resolution' simulations\nsystematically underestimate HI column densities, leading to an HI deficiency\nin low-mass ($M_\\star < 10^{10}M_\\odot$) galaxies and poor reproduction of the\nobserved HI mass function. These shortcomings are largely absent from EAGLE\nsimulations featuring a factor of 8 (2) better mass (spatial) resolution,\nwithin which the HI mass of galaxies evolves more mildly from $z=1$ to $0$ than\nin the standard-resolution simulations. The largest-volume simulation\nreproduces the observed clustering of HI systems, and its dependence on\nHI-richness. At fixed $M_\\star$, galaxies acquire more HI in simulations with\nstronger feedback, as they become associated with more massive haloes and\nhigher infall rates. They acquire less HI in simulations with a greater star\nformation efficiency, since the star formation and feedback necessary to\nbalance the infall rate is produced by smaller gas reservoirs. The simulations\nindicate that the HI of present-day galaxies was acquired primarily by the\nsmooth accretion of ionized, intergalactic gas at $z\\simeq1$, which later\nself-shields, and that only a small fraction is contributed by the\nreincorporation of gas previously heated strongly by feedback. HI reservoirs\nare highly dynamic: over $40$ percent of HI associated with $z=0.1$ galaxies is\nconverted to stars or ejected by $z=0$.\n", "  We investigate the critical current, $I_C$, of ballistic Josephson junctions\nmade of encapsulated graphene/boron-nitride heterostructures. We observe a\ncrossover from the short to the long junction regimes as the length of the\ndevice increases. In long ballistic junctions, $I_S$ is found to scale as\n$\\propto \\exp(-k_bT/\\delta E)$. The extracted energies $\\delta E$ are\nindependent of the carrier density and proportional to the level spacing of the\nballistic cavity, as determined from Fabry-Perot oscillations of the junction\nnormal resistance. As $T\\rightarrow 0$ the critical current of a long (or\nshort) junction saturates at a level determined by the product of $\\delta E$\n(or $\\Delta$) and the number of the junction's transversal modes.\n", "  We use the Copernicus Complexio (COCO) high resolution $N$-body simulations\nto investigate differences in the properties of small-scale structures in the\nstandard cold dark matter (CDM) model and in a model with a cutoff in the\ninitial power spectrum of density fluctuations consistent with both a thermally\nproduced warm dark matter (WDM) particle or a sterile neutrino with mass 7 keV\nand leptogenesis parameter $L_6=8.7$. The latter corresponds to the \"coldest\"\nmodel with this sterile neutrino mass compatible with the identification of the\nrecently detected 3.5 keV X-ray line as resulting from particle decay. CDM and\nWDM predict very different number densities of subhaloes with mass $\\leq\n10^9\\,h^{-1}\\,M_\\odot$ although they predict similar, nearly universal,\nnormalised subhalo radial density distributions. Haloes and subhaloes in both\nmodels have cuspy NFW profiles, but WDM subhaloes below the cutoff scale in the\npower spectrum (corresponding to maximum circular velocities\n$V_{\\mathrm{max}}^{z=0} \\leq50~\\mathrm{kms}^{-1}$) are less concentrated than\ntheir CDM counterparts. We make predictions for observable properties using the\nGALFORM semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. Both models predict Milky Way\nsatellite luminosity functions consistent with observations, although the WDM\nmodel predicts fewer very faint satellites. This model, however, predicts\nslightly more UV bright galaxies at redshift $z>7$ than CDM, but both are\nconsistent with observations. Gravitational lensing offers the best prospect of\ndistinguishing between the models.\n", "  A sleeping beauty in diffusion indicates that the information, can be ideas\nor innovations, will experience a hibernation before a sudden spike of\npopularity and it is widely found in citation history of scientific\npublications. However, in this study, we demonstrate that the sleeping beauty\nis an interesting and unexceptional phenomenon in information diffusion and\neven more inspiring, there exist two consecutive sleeping beauties in the\nentire lifetime of propagation, suggesting that the information, including\nscientific topics, search queries or Wikipedia entries, which we call memes,\nwill go unnoticed for a period and suddenly attracts some attention, and then\nit falls asleep again and later wakes up with another unexpected popularity\npeak. Further explorations on this phenomenon show that intervals between two\nwake ups follow an exponential distribution and the second wake up generally\nreaches its peak at a higher velocity. In addition, higher volume of the first\nwake up will lead to even much higher popularity of the second wake up with\ngreat odds. Taking these findings into consideration, an upgraded Bass model is\npresented to well describe the diffusion dynamics of memes on different media.\nOur results can help understand the common mechanism behind propagation of\ndifferent memes and are instructive to locate the tipping point in marketing or\nfind innovative publications in science.\n", "  We present a simple model for gas and dust flow from\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko that can be used to understand the grain impact\nobserved by the DIM instrument on Philae (Krueger et al. 2015) We show how\nmodel results when applied to the GIADA measurements (Rotundi et al. 2015;\nDella Corte et al. 2015) can be used, in conjunction with the results found by\nthe MIRO (Schloerb et al. 2015) and VIRTIS (De Sanctis et al. 2015) instruments\nto infer surface properties such as surface temperature and surface ice\nfraction.\n", "  We investigate how the stellar populations of the inner regions of the first\nand the second brightest group galaxies (respectively BGGs and SBGGs) vary as a\nfunction of magnitude gap, using an SDSS-based sample of 550 groups with\nelliptical BGGs. The sample is complete in redshift, luminosity and for $\\Delta\n\\mathcal{M}_{12}$ up to 2.5 mag, and contains 59 large-gap groups (LGGs, with\n$\\Delta \\mathcal{M}_{12} > 2.0$ mag). We determine ages, metallicities, and\nSFHs of BGGs and SBGGs using the STARLIGHT code with two different single\nstellar population models (which lead to important disagreements in SFHs), and\nalso compute $[\\alpha/{\\rm Fe}]$ from spectral indices. After removing the\ndependence with galaxy velocity dispersion or with stellar mass, there is no\ncorrelation with magnitude gap of BGG ages, metallicities, $[\\alpha/{\\rm Fe}]$,\nand SFHs. The lack of trends of BGG SFHs with magnitude gap suggests that BGGs\nin LGGs have undergone more mergers than those in small-gap groups, but these\nmergers are either dry or occurred at very high redshift, which in either case\nwould leave no detectable imprint in their spectra. We show that SBGGs in LGGs\nlie significantly closer to the BGGs (in projection) than galaxies with similar\nstellar masses in normal groups, which appears to be a sign of the earlier\nentry of the former into their groups. Nevertheless, the stellar population\nproperties of the SBGGs in LGGs are compatible with those of the general\npopulation of galaxies with similar stellar masses residing in normal groups.\n", "  In a hybrid pumping alkali vapor cell that both K and Rb are filled, K atom\nspins are optically pumped by laser and Rb atom spins are polarized by the K\nspins through spin exchange. We find that the AC Stark shift of the Rb atoms is\ncomposed of not only the AC Stark shift of the Rb atoms caused by the far off\nresonant pumping laser which is tuned to the K absorption lines, but also the\nAC Stark shift of the K atom spins. The mixing of the light shifts through fast\nspin exchange between K and Rb atoms are studied in this paper and we\ndemonstrate a K-Rb-21Ne co-magnetometer in which the AC Stark shift of the Rb\natoms are reduced by the collision mixing.\n", "  Previous studies have shown that the radiation emitted by a rapidly rotating\nmagnetar embedded in a young supernova can greatly amplify its luminosity.\nThese one-dimensional studies have also revealed the existence of an\ninstability arising from the piling up of radiatively accelerated matter in a\nthin dense shell deep inside the supernova. Here we examine the problem in two\ndimensions and find that, while instabilities cause mixing and fracture this\nshell into filamentary structures that reduce the density contrast, the\nconcentration of matter in a hollow shell persists. The extent of the mixing\ndepends upon the relative energy input by the magnetar and the kinetic energy\nof the inner ejecta. The light curve and spectrum of the resulting supernova\nwill be appreciably altered, as will the appearance of the supernova remnant,\nwhich will be shellular and filamentary. A similar pile up and mixing might\ncharacterize other events where energy is input over an extended period by a\ncentrally concentrated source, e.g. a pulsar, radioactive decay, a\nneutrino-powered wind, or colliding shells. The relevance of our models to the\nrecent luminous transient ASASSN-15lh is briefly discussed.\n", "  Several experiments reported hints for the violation of lepton flavor or\nlepton flavor universality in processes involving muons. Most prominently,\nthere is the hint for a non-zero rate of the flavor violating Higgs decay $h\n\\to \\tau\\mu$ at the LHC, as well as the hint for lepton flavor universality\nviolation in rare $B$ meson decays at LHCb. In addition, also the long standing\ndiscrepancy in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon motivates new physics\nconnected to muons. A symmetry which violates lepton flavor universality, is\n$L_\\mu-L_\\tau$: the difference of muon-number and tau-number. We show that\nadding vector-like fermions to a $L_\\mu-L_\\tau$ theory generates naturally an\neffect in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and $h\\to\\tau\\mu$, while\neffects in other $\\tau \\to \\mu$ transitions are systematically suppressed by\nsymmetry arguments. We find that if $L_\\mu-L_\\tau$ is gauged it is possible to\nalso accommodate the discrepant $b\\to s\\mu\\mu$ data while predicting a\n$\\tau\\to3\\mu$ and a modified $h\\to\\mu\\mu$ rate within reach of upcoming\nexperiments.\n", "  The dark photon ($A'$) production through the mixing with the bremsstrahlung\nphoton from the electron scattering off nuclei can be accompanied by the\ndominant invisible $A'$ decay into dark-sector particles. In this work we\ndiscuss the missing energy signature of this process in the experiment NA64\naiming at the search for $A'\\to invisible$ decays with a high-energy electron\nbeam at the CERN SPS. We show the distinctive distributions of variables that\ncan be used to distinguish the $A'\\to invisible$ signal from background. The\nresults of the detailed simulation of the detector response for the events with\nand without $A'$ emission are presented. The efficiency of the signal event\nselection is estimated. It is used to evaluate the sensitivity of the\nexperiment and show that it allows to probe the still unexplored area of the\nmixing strength $10^{-6}\\lesssim \\epsilon \\lesssim 10^{-2}$ and masses up to\n$M_{A'} \\lesssim 1$ GeV. The results obtained are compared with the results\nfrom other calculations. In the case of the signal observation, a possibility\nof extraction of the parameters $M_{A'}$ and $\\epsilon$ by using the missing\nenergy spectrum shape is discussed. We consider as an example the $A'$ with the\nmass 16.7 MeV and mixing $\\epsilon \\lesssim 10^{-3}$, which can explain an\nexcess of events recently observed in nuclear transitions of an excited state\nof $^8$Be. We show that if such $A'$ exists its invisible decay can be observed\nin NA64 within a month of running, while data accumulated during a few months\nwould allow also to determine the $\\epsilon$ and $M_{A'}$ parameters.\n", "  We consider the flavor-changing decays of the Higgs boson in a grand unified\ntheory framework which is based on the SU(5) gauge group and implements the\nprinciple of minimal flavor violation. This allows us to explore the\npossibility of connecting the tentative hint of the Higgs decay $h\\to\\mu\\tau$\nrecently reported in the CMS experiment to potential new physics in the quark\nsector. We look at different simple scenarios with minimal flavor violation in\nthis context and how they are subject to various empirical restrictions. In one\nspecific case, the relative strengths of the flavor-changing leptonic Higgs\ncouplings are determined mainly by the known quark mixing parameters and\nmasses, and a branching fraction ${\\cal B}(h\\to\\mu\\tau)\\sim1\\%$ is achievable\nwithout the couplings being incompatible with the relevant constraints.\nUpcoming data on the Higgs leptonic decays and searches for the $\\mu\\to\ne\\gamma$ decay with improved precision can offer further tests on this\nscenario.\n", "  We introduce a variational implementation of cluster perturbation theory\n(CPT) to address the dynamics of spin systems driven out of equilibrium. We\nbenchmark the method with the quantum Ising model subject to a sudden quench of\nthe transverse magnetic field across the transition or within a phase. We treat\nboth the one-dimensional case, for which an exact solution is available, as\nwell the two-dimensional one, for which has to resort to numerical results.\nComparison with exact results shows that the approach provides a quite accurate\ndescription of the real-time dynamics up to a characteristic time scale $\\tau$\nthat increses with the size of the cluster used for CPT. In addition, and not\nsurprisingly $\\tau$ is small for quenches across the equilibrium phase\ntransition, but can be quite larger for quenches within the ordered or\ndisordered phases.\n", "  Ultracool dwarfs (UCD; $T_{\\rm eff}<\\sim3000~$K) cool to settle on the main\nsequence after $\\sim$1 Gyr. For brown dwarfs, this cooling never stops. Their\nhabitable zone (HZ) thus sweeps inward at least during the first Gyr of their\nlives. Assuming they possess water, planets found in the HZ of UCDs have\nexperienced a runaway greenhouse phase too hot for liquid water prior to\nentering the HZ. It has been proposed that such planets are desiccated by this\nhot early phase and enter the HZ as dry worlds. Here we model the water loss\nduring this pre-HZ hot phase taking into account recent upper limits on the XUV\nemission of UCDs and using 1D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. We address\nthe whole range of UCDs but also focus on the planets recently found around the\n$0.08~M_\\odot$ dwarf TRAPPIST-1.\n  Despite assumptions maximizing the FUV-photolysis of water and the XUV-driven\nescape of hydrogen, we find that planets can retain significant amounts of\nwater in the HZ of UCDs, with a sweet spot in the $0.04$-$0.06~M_\\odot$ range.\nWe also studied the TRAPPIST-1 system using observed constraints on the\nXUV-flux. We find that TRAPPIST-1b and c may have lost as much as 15 Earth\nOceans and planet d -- which might be inside the HZ -- may have lost less than\n1 Earth Ocean. Depending on their initial water contents, they could have\nenough water to remain habitable. TRAPPIST-1 planets are key targets for\natmospheric characterization and could provide strong constraints on the water\nerosion around UCDs.\n", "  The quantum vacuum fundamentally alters the properties of embedded particles.\nIn contrast to classical empty space, it allows for creation and annihilation\nof excitations. For trapped particles this leads to a change in the energy\nspectrum, known as Lamb shift. Here, we engineer a synthetic vacuum building on\nthe unique properties of ultracold atomic gas mixtures. This system makes it\npossible to combine high-precision spectroscopy with the ability of switching\nbetween empty space and quantum vacuum. We observe the phononic Lamb shift, an\nintruiguing many-body effect orginally conjectured in the context of solid\nstate physics. Our study therefore opens up new avenues for high-precision\nbenchmarking of non-trivial theoretical predictions in the realm of the quantum\nvacuum.\n", "  The \"parity\" anomaly -- more accurately described as an anomaly in\ntime-reversal or reflection symmetry -- arises in certain theories of fermions\ncoupled to gauge fields and/or gravity in a spacetime of odd dimension. This\nanomaly has traditionally been studied on orientable manifolds only, but recent\ndevelopments involving topological superconductors have made it clear that one\ncan get more information by asking what happens on an unorientable manifold. In\nthis paper, we give a full description of the \"parity\" anomaly for fermions\ncoupled to gauge fields and gravity in $2+1$ dimensions on a possibly\nunorientable spacetime. We consider an application to topological\nsuperconductors and another application to M-theory. The application to\ntopological superconductors involves using knowledge of the \"parity\" anomaly as\nan ingredient in constructing gapped boundary states of these systems and in\nparticular in gapping the boundary of a $\\nu=16$ system in a topologically\ntrivial fashion. The application to M-theory involves showing the consistency\nof the path integral of an M-theory membrane on a possibly unorientable\nworldvolume. In the past, this has been done only in the orientable case.\n", "  We present a scalable architecture for the exploration of interacting\ntopological phases of photons in arrays of microwave cavities, using\nestablished techniques from cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics. A\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking (non-reciprocal) flux is induced by coupling\nthe microwave cavities to ferrites, allowing for the production of a variety of\ntopological band structures including the $\\alpha=1/4$ Hofstadter model.\nEffective photon-photon interactions are included by coupling the cavities to\nsuperconducting qubits, and are sufficient to produce a $\\nu=1/2$ bosonic\nLaughlin puddle. We demonstrate by exact diagonalization that this architecture\nis robust to experimentally achievable levels of disorder. These advances\nprovide an exciting opportunity to employ the quantum circuit toolkit for the\nexploration of strongly interacting topological materials.\n", "  We introduce a new set of large scale, high resolution hydrodynamical\nsimulations of the intergalactic medium: the Sherwood simulation suite. These\nare performed in volumes 10^3-160^3 h^-3 comoving Mpc^{3}, span almost four\norders of magnitude in mass resolution with up to 17.2 billion particles, and\nemploy a variety of physics variations including warm dark matter and galactic\noutflows. We undertake a detailed comparison of the simulations to high\nresolution, high signal-to-noise observations of the Lyman-alpha forest over\nthe redshift range 2 < z < 5. The simulations are in very good agreement with\nthe observational data, lending further support to the paradigm that the\nLyman-alpha forest is a natural consequence of the web-like distribution of\nmatter arising in LCDM cosmological models. Only a small number of minor\ndiscrepancies remain with respect to the observational data. Saturated\nLyman-alpha absorption lines with column densities N_HI > 10^14.5 cm^-2 at 2 <\nz < 2.5 are underpredicted in the models. An uncertain correction for continuum\nplacement bias is required to match the distribution and power spectrum of the\ntransmitted flux, particularly at z > 4. Finally, the temperature of\nintergalactic gas in the simulations may be slightly too low at z=2.7 and a\nflatter temperature-density relation is required at z=2.4, consistent with the\nexpected effects of non-equilibrium ionisation during He-II reionisation.\n", "  We study the applicability of the derivative nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger (DNLS)\nequation, for the evolution of high frequency nonlinear waves, observed at the\nforeshock region of the terrestrial quasi-parallel bow shock. The use of a\npseudo-potential is elucidated and, in particular, the importance of canonical\nrepresentation in the correct interpretation of solutions in this formulation\nis discussed. Numerical solutions of the DNLS equation are then compared\ndirectly with the wave forms observed by Cluster spacecraft. Non harmonic slow\nvariations are filtered out by applying the empirical mode decomposition. We\nfind large amplitude nonlinear wave trains at frequencies above the proton\ncyclotron frequency, followed in time by nearly harmonic low amplitude\nfluctuations. The approximate phase speed of these nonlinear waves, indicated\nby the parameters of numerical solutions, is of the order of the local\nAlfv\\'{e}n speed.\n", "  Nonstandard interactions (NSI) of neutrinos with matter can significantly\nalter neutrino flavor evolution in supernovae with the potential to impact\nexplosion dynamics, nucleosynthesis, and the neutrinos signal. In this paper,\nwe explore, both numerically and analytically, the landscape of neutrino flavor\ntransformation effects in supernovae due to NSI and find a new, heretofore\nunseen transformation processes can occur. These new transformations can take\nplace with NSI strengths well below current experimental limits. Within a broad\nswath of NSI parameter space, we observe symmetric and standard matter-neutrino\nresonances for supernovae neutrinos, a transformation effect previously only\nseen in compact object merger scenarios; in another region of the parameter\nspace we find the NSI can induce neutrino collective effects in scenarios where\nnone would appear with only the standard case of neutrino oscillation physics;\nand in a third region the NSI can lead to the disappearance of the high density\nMikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein resonance. Using a variety of analytical tools, we\nare able to describe quantitatively the numerical results allowing us to\npartition the NSI parameter according to the transformation processes observed.\nOur results indicate nonstandard interactions of supernova neutrinos provide a\nsensitive probe of beyond the Standard Model physics complementary to present\nand future terrestrial experiments.\n", "  Large-scale structure has been shown as a promising cosmic probe for\ndistinguishing and constraining dark energy models. Using the growth index\nparametrization, we obtain an analytic formula for the growth rate of\nstructures in a coupled dark energy model in which the exchange of\nenergy-momentum is proportional to the dark energy density. We find that the\nevolution of $f \\sigma_8$ can be determined analytically once we know the\ncoupling, the dark energy equation of state, the present value of the dark\nenergy density parameter and the current mean amplitude of dark matter\nfluctuations. After correcting the growth function for the correspondence with\nthe velocity field through the continuity equation in the interacting model, we\nuse our analytic result to compare the model's predictions with large-scale\nstructure observations.\n", "  The power mechanism and accretion geometry for low-power FR1 radio galaxies\nis poorly understood in comparison to Seyfert galaxies and QSOs. In this paper\nwe use the diagnostic power of the Lya recombination line observed using the\nCosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to\ninvestigate the accretion flows in three well-known, nearby FR1s: M87, NGC4696,\nand HydraA. The Ly$\\alpha$ emission line's luminosity, velocity structure and\nthe limited knowledge of its spatial extent provided by COS are used to assess\nconditions within a few parsecs of the super-massive black hole (SMBH) in these\nradio-mode AGN. We observe strong Ly$\\alpha$ emission in all three objects with\nsimilar total luminosity to that seen in BL Lacertae objects. M87 shows a\ncomplicated emission line profile in Lya which varies spatially across the COS\naperture and possibly temporally over several epochs of observation. In both\nNGC 4696 and M87, the Ly$\\alpha$ luminosities $\\sim 10^{40}$ ergs/s are closely\nconsistent with the observed strength of the ionizing continuum in Case B\nrecombination theory and with the assumption of near unity covering factor. It\nis possible that the Ly$\\alpha$ emitting clouds are ionized largely by beamed\nradiation associated with the jets. Long-slit UV spectroscopy can be used to\ntest this hypothesis. Hydra A and the several BL Lac objects studied in this\nand previous papers have Lya luminosities larger than M87 but their\nextrapolated, non-thermal continua are so luminous that they over-predict the\nobserved strength of Ly$\\alpha$, a clear indicator of relativistic beaming in\nour direction. Given their substantial space density ($\\sim 4\\times10^{-3}\nMpc^{-3}$) the unbeamed Lyman continuum radiation of FR1s may make a\nsubstantial minority contribution (~10%) to the local UV background if all FR1s\nare similar to M87 in ionizing flux level.\n", "  LiFePO4-based cathodes suffer from various degradation mechanisms which\ninfluences the battery performance. In this paper morphological and structural\ndegradation phenomena in laboratory cathodes made of LiFePO4 (LFP) mixed with\ncarbon black (CB) in an 1 mol L-1 LiPF6 in EC:DMC (1:1 by weight) electrolyte\nare investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at various\npreparation, assembling, storage and cycling stages. High-resolution TEM\n(HRTEM) imaging shows that continuous SEI layers are formed on the LFP\nparticles and that both storage and cycling affects the formation. Additionally\nloss of CB crystallinity, CB aggregation and agglomeration is observed.\nCharge-discharge curves and impedance spectra measured during cycling confirm\nthat these degradation mechanisms reduce the cathode conductivity and capacity.\n", "  Feasible setup for pulsed quantum non-demolition interaction between two\ndistant mechanical oscillators through optical or microwave mediator is\nproposed. The proposal uses homodyne measurement of the mediator and\nfeedforward control of the mechanical oscillators to reach the interaction. To\nverify quantum nature of the interaction, we investigate the Gaussian\nentanglement generated in the mechanical modes. We evaluate it under influence\nof mechanical bath and propagation loss for the mediator and propose ways to\noptimize the interaction. Finally, both currently available optomechanical and\nelectromechanical platforms are numerically analyzed. The analysis shows that\nimplementation is already feasible with current technology.\n", "  We study far from equilibrium transport of a periodically driven inertial\nBrownian particle moving in a periodic potential. As detected recently for a\nSQUID ratchet dynamics (Spiechowicz J. & Luczka J. Phys. Rev. E 91, 062104\n(2015)), the mean square deviation of the particle position from its average\nmay involve three distinct intermediate, although extended diffusive regimes:\ninitially as superdiffusion, followed by subdiffusion and finally, normal\ndiffusion in the asymptotic long time limit. Even though these anomalies are\ntransient effects, their lifetime can be many, many orders of magnitude longer\nthan the characteristic time scale of the setup and turns out to be\nextraordinarily sensitive to the system parameters like temperature or the\npotential asymmetry. In the paper we reveal mechanisms of diffusion anomalies\nrelated to ergodicity of the system, symmetry breaking of the periodic\npotential and ultraslow relaxation of the particle velocity towards its steady\nstate. Similar sequences of the diffusive behaviours could be detected in\nvarious systems including, among others, colloidal particles in random\npotentials, glass forming liquids and granular gases.\n", "  Since their formation, stars slow down their rotation rates by the removal of\nangular momentum from their surfaces, e.g. via stellar winds. Despite the\ncomplexity of the processes involved, a traditional model, where the removal of\nangular momentum loss by magnetic fields is prescribed, has provided a useful\nframework to understand observational relations between stellar rotation and\nage and magnetic field strength. Here, a spindown model is proposed where loss\nof angular momentum by magnetic fields is evolved dynamically, instead of being\nkinematically prescribed. To this end, we evolve the stellar rotation and\nmagnetic field simultaneously over stellar evolution time by extending our\nprevious work on a dynamo model which incorporates the nonlinear feedback\nmechanisms on rotation and magnetic fields. Our extended model reproduces key\nobservations and explains the presence of the two branches of (fast and slow\nrotating) stars which have different relations between rotation rate $\\Omega$\nvs. time (age), magnetic field strength $|B|$ vs. rotation rate, and frequency\nof magnetic field $\\omega_{cyc}$ vs. rotation rate. For fast rotating stars we\nfind: (i) an exponential spindown $\\Omega \\propto e^{-1.35t}$, with $t$\nmeasured in Gyrs, (ii) $|B|$ saturates for higher rotation rate, (iii)\n$\\omega_{cyc} \\propto \\Omega^{0.85}$. For slow rotating stars we obtain: (i) a\npower law spindown $\\Omega \\propto t^{-0.52}$, (ii) $|B|$ scales almost\nlinearly with rotation rate, (iii) $\\omega_{cyc} \\propto \\Omega^{1.16}$. The\nresults obtained are in good agreement with observations. The Vaughan-Preston\ngap is consistently explained in our model by the shortest spindown timescale\nin this transition from fast to slow rotators. Our results highlight the\nimportance of self-regulation of magnetic fields and rotation by direct and\nindirect interactions involving nonlinear feedback in stellar evolution.\n", "  By how much must the communication complexity of a function increase if we\ndemand that the parties not only correctly compute the function but also return\nall registers (other than the one containing the answer) to their initial\nstates at the end of the communication protocol? Protocols that achieve this\nare referred to as clean and the associated cost as the clean communication\ncomplexity. Here we present clean protocols for calculating the Inner Product\nof two $n$-bit strings, showing that (in the absence of pre-shared\nentanglement) at most $n+3$ qubits or $n+O(\\sqrt{n})$ bits of communication are\nrequired. The quantum protocol provides inspiration for obtaining the optimal\nmethod to implement distributed CNOT gates in parallel whilst minimizing the\namount of quantum communication. For more general functions, we show that\nnearly all Boolean functions require close to $2n$ bits of classical\ncommunication to compute and close to $n$ qubits if the parties have access to\npre-shared entanglement. Both of these values are maximal for their respective\nparadigms.\n", "  We study quantum gravity signatures emerging from phenomenologically\nmotivated multiscale models, spectral actions, and Causal Set Theory within the\ndetector approach to the Unruh effect. We show that while the Unruh temperature\nis unaffected, Lorentz-invariant corrections to the two-point function leave a\ncharacteristic fingerprint in the induced emission rate of the accelerated\ndetector. Generically, quantum gravity models exhibiting dynamical dimensional\nreduction exhibit a suppression of the Unruh rate at high energy while the rate\nis enhanced in Kaluza-Klein theories with compact extra dimensions. We quantify\nthis behavior by introducing the \"Unruh dimension\" as the effective spacetime\ndimension seen by the Unruh effect and show that it is related, though not\nidentical, to the spectral dimension used to characterize spacetime in quantum\ngravity. We comment on the physical origins of these effects and their\nrelevance for black hole evaporation.\n", "  Assigning a chaos index for dynamics of generic quantum field theories is a\nchallenging problem, because the notion of Lyapunov exponent, which is useful\nfor singling out chaotic behaviors, works only in classical systems. We address\nthe issue by using the AdS/CFT correspondence, as the large $N_c$ limit\nprovides a classicalization (other than the standard $\\hbar \\to 0$) while\nkeeping nontrivial quantum condensation. We demonstrate the chaos in the\ndynamics of quantum gauge theories: Time evolution of homogeneous quark\ncondensates $\\langle \\bar{q}q\\rangle$ and $\\langle \\bar{q} \\gamma_5 q\\rangle$\nin an ${\\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric QCD with the $SU(N_c)$ gauge group at large\n$N_c$ and at large 't Hooft coupling $\\lambda \\equiv N_c g_{\\rm YM}^2$ exhibits\na positive Lyapunov exponent. The chaos dominates the phase space for energy\ndensity $E \\gtrsim (6\\times 10^2)\\times m_q^4(N_c/\\lambda^2) $ where $m_q$ is\nthe quark mass. We evaluate the largest Lyapunov exponent as a function of\n$(N_c,\\lambda,E)$ and find that the ${\\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric QCD is more\nchaotic for smaller $N_c$.\n", "  Strontium titanate is a low-temperature, non-Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer\nsuperconductor that superconducts to carrier concentrations lower than in any\nother system and exhibits avoided ferroelectricity at low temperatures. Neither\nthe mechanism of superconductivity in strontium titanate nor the importance of\nthe structure and dielectric properties for the superconductivity are well\nunderstood. We studied the effects of twin structure on superconductivity in a\n5.5-nm-thick layer of niobium-doped SrTiO$_{3}$ embedded in undoped\nSrTiO$_{3}$. We used a scanning superconducting quantum interference device\nsusceptometer to image the local diamagnetic response of the sample as a\nfunction of temperature. We observed regions that exhibited a superconducting\ntransition temperature $T_{c}$ $\\gtrsim$ 10% higher than the temperature at\nwhich the sample was fully superconducting. The pattern of these regions varied\nspatially in a manner characteristic of structural twin domains. Our results\nemphasize that the anisotropic dielectric properties of SrTiO$_{3}$ are\nimportant for its superconductivity, and need to be considered in any theory of\nthe mechanism of the superconductivity.\n", "  We reformulate the relativistic perfect fluid system on curved space-time.\nUsing standard variables, the velocity field $u$,energy density $\\rho$ and\npressure $p$, the covariant Euler-Lagrange equation is obtained from\nvariational principle. This leads to the Euler equation and the equation of\ncontinuity in reparametrization invariant form.\n", "  Gaia is a major European Space Agency (ESA) astrophysics mission designed to\nmap and analyse 10$^9$ stars, ultimately generating more than 1 PetaByte of\ndata products. As Gaia data becomes publicly available and reaches a wider\naudience, there is an increasing need to facilitate the further use of Gaia\nproducts without needing to download large datasets. The Gaia Added Value\nInterface Platform (GAVIP) is designed to address this challenge by providing\nan innovative platform within which scientists can submit and deploy code,\npackaged as \"Added Value Interfaces\" (AVIs), which will be executed close to\nthe data. Deployed AVIs and associated outputs may also be made available to\nother GAVIP platform users, thus providing a mechanism for scientific\nexperiment reproducibility. This paper describes the capabilities and features\nof GAVIP.\n", "  We study the universal conditions for quantum non-perturbative stability\nagainst bubble nucleation for pertubatively stable AdS vacua based on positive\nenergy theorems. We also compare our analysis with the pre-existing ones in the\nliterature carried out within the thin-wall approximation. The aforementioned\ncriterion is then tested in two explicit examples describing massive type IIA\nstring theory compactified on $S^3$ and $S^3\\,\\times\\,S^3$, respectively. The\nAdS landscape of both classes of compactifications is known to consist of a set\nof isolated points. The main result is that all critical points respecting the\nBreitenlohner-Freedaman (BF) bound also turn out be stable at a\nnon-perturbative level. Finally, we speculate on the possible universal\nfeatures that may be extracted from the above specific examples.\n", "  Within four nearby (d < 160 pc) molecular clouds, we statistically evaluate\nthe structure of the interstellar magnetic field, projected on the plane of the\nsky and integrated along the line of sight, as inferred from the polarized\nthermal emission of Galactic dust observed by Planck at 353 GHz and from the\noptical and NIR polarization of background starlight. We compare the dispersion\nof the field orientation directly in vicinities with an area equivalent to that\nsubtended by the Planck effective beam at 353 GHz (10') and using the\nsecond-order structure functions of the field orientation angles. We find that\nthe average dispersion of the starlight-inferred field orientations within\n10'-diameter vicinities is less than 20 deg, and that at these scales the mean\nfield orientation is on average within 5 deg of that inferred from the\nsubmillimetre polarization observations in the considered regions. We also find\nthat the dispersion of starlight polarization orientations and the polarization\nfractions within these vicinities are well reproduced by a Gaussian model of\nthe turbulent structure of the magnetic field, in agreement with the findings\nreported by the Planck collaboration at scales greater than 10' and for\ncomparable column densities. At scales greater than 10', we find differences of\nup to 14.7 deg between the second-order structure functions obtained from\nstarlight and submillimetre polarization observations in the same positions in\nthe plane of the sky, but comparison with a Gaussian model of the turbulent\nstructure of the magnetic field indicates that these differences are small and\nare consistent with the difference in angular resolution between both\ntechniques.\n", "  Enhancing of sensitivity of the opto-acoustical gravitational wave (GW)\nantenna OGRAN installed in the underground facilities of Baksan Neutrino\nObservatory is analyzed. Calculations are presented showing a sensitivity\nimproving on two orders of value after a cooling the solid body acoustical part\nof the antenna to the nitrogen temperature. A possibility of keeping of the\nsame optical scheme of the antenna at low temperature is discussed. Design of\nmodernized construction for cryogenic version of the antenna OGRAN is\ndescribed. Test experiments with cooled pilot model carrying cryogenic mirrors\nilluminated by the optical pump up to 0.5 W are presented.\n", "  Sr$_2$CuTeO$_6$ presents an opportunity for exploring low-dimensional\nmagnetism on a square lattice of $S=1/2$ Cu$^{2+}$ ions. We employ ab initio\nmulti-reference configuration interaction calculations to unravel the Cu$^{2+}$\nelectronic structure and to evaluate exchange interactions in Sr$_2$CuTeO$_6$.\nThe latter results are validated by inelastic neutron scattering using linear\nspin-wave theory and series-expansion corrections for quantum effects to\nextract true coupling parameters. Using this methodology, which is quite\ngeneral, we demonstrate that Sr$_2$CuTeO$_6$ is an almost realization of a\nnearest-neighbor Heisenberg antiferromagnet but with relatively weak coupling\nof 7.18(5) meV.\n", "  Motivated by a recent experiment of J.~Steinhauer, we reconsider the spectrum\nand the correlations of the phonons spontaneously emitted in stationary\ntransonic flows. The latter are described by \"waterfall\" configurations which\nform a one-parameter family of stable flows. For parameters close to their\nexperimental values, in spite of high gradients near the sonic horizon, the\nspectrum is accurately planckian in the relevant frequency domain, where the\ntemperature differs from the relativistic prediction by less than $10 \\%$. We\nthen study the density correlations across the horizon and the non-separable\ncharacter of the final state. We show that the relativistic expressions provide\naccurate approximations when the initial temperature is not too high. We also\nshow that the phases of the scattering coefficients introduce a finite shift of\nthe location of the correlations which was so far overlooked. This shift is due\nto the asymmetry of the flow across the horizon, and persists in the\ndispersion-less regime. Finally we show how the formation of the sonic horizon\nmodifies both local and non-local density correlations.\n", "  Solitons are peculiar excitations that appear in a wide range of nonlinear\nsystems such as in fluids or optics. We show here that the collective transport\nof charges observed in charge density wave (CDW) systems can be explained by\nusing a similar theory based on a traveling soliton lattice. Coherent x-ray\ndiffraction experiment performed in the sliding state of a CDW material reveals\npeculiar diffraction patterns in good agreement with this assumption.\nTherefore, the collective transport of charges in CDW systems may be due to a\nnonlinear interaction leading to a self-localized excitation, carrying charges\nwithout deformation through the sample, on top of the CDW ground state. This\nsingle theory explains why charges remain spatially correlated over very long\ndistances and reconciles the main features of sliding CDW systems, either\nobserved by transport measurements or diffraction.\n", "  Ever since BCS theory was first formulated it was recognized that a large\nelectronic density of states at the Fermi level was beneficial to enhancing\n$T_c$. The A15 compounds and the high temperature cuprate materials both have\nhad an enormous amount of effort devoted to studying the possibility that such\npeaks play an important role in the high critical temperatures existing in\nthese compounds. Here we provide a systematic study of the effect of these\npeaks on the superconducting transition temperature for a variety of\ntight-binding models of simple structures, both in two and three dimensions. In\nthree dimensions large enhancements in $T_c$ can occur, due to van Hove\nsingularities that result in divergences in the density of states. Furthermore,\neven in more realistic structures, where the van Hove singularity disappears,\nlarge enhancements in $T_c$ continue due to the presence of `robust' peaks in\nthe densities of states. Such a peak, recently identified in the bcc structure\nof H$_3$S, is likely the result of such a van Hove singularity. In certain\nregimes, anomalies in the isotope coefficient are also expected.\n", "  For the past forty years, optical fibres have found widespread use in\nground-based and space-based instruments. In most applications, these fibres\nare used in conjunction with conventional optics to transport light. But\nphotonics offers a huge range of optical manipulations beyond light transport\nthat were rarely exploited before 2001. The fundamental obstacle to the broader\nuse of photonics is the difficulty of achieving photonic action in a multimode\nfibre. The first step towards a general solution was the invention of the\nphotonic lantern (Leon-Saval, Birks & Bland-Hawthorn 2005) and the delivery of\nhigh-efficiency devices (< 1 dB loss) five years on (Noordegraaf et al 2009).\nMulticore fibres (MCF), used in conjunction with lanterns, are now enabling an\neven bigger leap towards multimode photonics. Until recently, the single-moded\ncores in MCFs were not sufficiently uniform to achieve telecom (SMF-28)\nperformance. Now that high-quality MCFs have been realized, we turn our\nattention to printing complex functions (e.g. Bragg gratings for OH\nsuppression) into their N cores. Our first work in this direction used a\nMach-Zehnder interferometer (near-field phase mask) but this approach was only\nadequate for N=7 MCFs as measured by the grating uniformity (Lindley et al\n2014). We have now built a Sagnac interferometer that gives a three-fold\nincrease in the depth of field sufficient to print across N > 127 cores. We\nachieved first light this year with our 500mW Sabre FRED laser. These are\nsophisticated and complex interferometers. We report on our progress to date\nand summarize our first-year goals which include multimode OH suppression\nfibres for the Anglo-Australian Telescope/PRAXIS instrument and the Discovery\nChannel Telescope/MOHSIS instrument under development at the University of\nMaryland.\n", "  This paper investigates continuous-time quantum walks on directed bipartite\ngraphs based on a graph's adjacency matrix. We prove that on bipartite graphs,\nprobability transport between the two node partitions can be completely\nsuppressed by tuning a model parameter $\\alpha$. We provide analytic solutions\nto the quantum walks for the star and circulant graph classes that are valid\nfor an arbitrary value of the number of nodes $N$, time $t$ and the model\nparameter $\\alpha$. We discuss quantitative and qualitative aspects of quantum\nwalks based on directed graphs and their undirected counterparts. Numerical\nsimulations of quantum walks on circulant graphs show complex interference\nphenomena and how complete suppression of transport is achieved near\n$\\alpha=\\pi/2$. By proving two mirror symmetries around $\\alpha=0$ and $\\pi/2$\nwe show that these quantum walks have a period of $\\pi$ in $\\alpha$. We show\nthat undirected edges lose their effect on the quantum walk at $\\alpha=\\pi/2$\nand present non-bipartite graphs that exhibit suppression of transport.\nFinally, we analytically compute the Hamiltonians of quantum walks on the\ndirected ring graph.\n", "  In this work, we investigate the implications of the Integrated Galaxy-wide\nstellar Initial Mass Function (IGIMF) approach in the framework of the\nsemi-analytic model GAEA (GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly), which features a\ndetailed treatment of chemical enrichment and stellar feedback. The IGIMF\nprovides an analytic description of the dependence of the stellar IMF shape on\nthe rate of star formation in galaxies. We find that our model with a universal\nIMF predicts a rather flat [$\\alpha$/Fe]-stellar mass relation. The model\nassuming the IGIMF, instead, is able to reproduce the observed increase of\n$\\alpha$-enhancement with stellar mass, in agreement with previous studies.\nThis is mainly due to the fact that massive galaxies are characterized by\nlarger star formation rates at high-redshift, leading to stronger\n$\\alpha$-enhancement with respect to low-mass galaxies. At the same time, the\nIGIMF hypothesis does not affect significantly the trend for shorter star\nformation timescales for more massive galaxies. We argue that in the IGIMF\nscenario the [$\\alpha$/Fe] ratios are good tracers of the highest star\nformation events. The final stellar masses and mass-to-light-ratio of our model\nmassive galaxies are larger than those estimated from the synthetic photometry\nassuming a universal IMF, providing a self-consistent interpretation of similar\nrecent results, based on dynamical analysis of local early type galaxies.\n", "  The presence of a zero texture in the neutrino mass matrix can indicate the\npresence of an underlying symmetry which can generate neutrino mass and mixing.\nIn this paper, for the first time we study the four-zero textures of the low\nenergy neutrino mass matrix in the presence of an extra light-sterile neutrino\ni.e., the 3+1 neutrino scheme. In our analysis we find that out of the 210\npossible four-zero textures only 15 textures are allowed. We divide the allowed\nfour-zero textures into two classes -- class $A$ in which the value of mass\nmatrix element $M_{ee}$ is zero and class $B$ in which $M_{ee}$ is non-zero. In\nthis way we obtain ten possible four-zero textures in class $A$ and five\npossible four-zero textures in class $B$. In our analysis we find that, for\nnormal hierarchy the allowed number of textures in class $A$ ($B$) is nine\n(three). For the case of inverted hierarchy we find that, two textures in class\n$A$ are disallowed and these textures are different from the disallowed\ntextures for normal hierarchy in class $A$. However, we find that all the five\ntextures in class $B$ are allowed for the inverted hierarchy. Based on analytic\nexpressions for the elements $M_{\\alpha\\beta}$, we discuss the reasons for\ncertain textures being disallowed. We also discuss the correlations between the\ndifferent parameters of the allowed textures. Finally, we present the\nimplications of our study on experimental searches for neutrinoless double beta\ndecay.\n", "  We report on a large 44 GHz ($7_0-6_1$ A$^+$) methanol (CH$_3$OH) maser\nsurvey of the Galactic Center (GC). The Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array was\nused to search for CH$_3$OH maser emission covering a large fraction of the\nregion around Sgr A. In 25 pointings, over 300 CH$_3$OH maser sources\n($>10\\sigma$) were detected. The majority of the maser sources have a single\npeak emission spectrum with line of sight velocities that range from about\n$-$13 km\\,s$^{-1}$ to 72 km\\,s$^{-1}$. Most maser sources were found to have\nvelocities around 35$-$55 km\\,s$^{-1}$, closely following velocities of\nneighboring interacting molecular clouds. The full width half maximum of each\nindividual spectral feature is very narrow ($\\sim$0.85 km\\,s$^{-1}$ on\naverage). In the north, where Sgr A East is known to be interacting with the 50\nkm\\,s$^{-1}$ molecular cloud, more than 100 44 GHz CH$_3$OH masers were\ndetected. In addition, three other distinct concentrations of masers were\nfound, which appear to be located closer to the interior of the interacting\nmolecular clouds. Possibly a subset of masers are associated with star\nformation, although conclusive evidence is lacking.\n", "  Giant planets can clear deep gaps when embedded in 2D (razor-thin) viscous\ncircumstellar disks. We show by direct simulation that giant planets are just\nas capable of carving out gaps in 3D. Surface density maps are similar between\n2D and 3D, even in detail. In particular, the scaling $\\Sigma_{\\rm gap} \\propto\nq^{-2}$ of gap surface density with planet mass, derived from a global\n\"zero-dimensional\" balance of Lindblad and viscous torques, applies equally\nwell to results obtained at higher dimensions. Our 3D simulations reveal\nextensive, near-sonic, meridional flows both inside and outside the gaps; these\nlarge-scale circulations might bear on disk compositional gradients, in dust or\nother chemical species. At high planet mass, gap edges are mildly Rayleigh\nunstable and intermittently shed streams of material into the gap - less so in\n3D than in 2D.\n", "  The orbital angular momentum and the polarisation of light are physical\nquantities widely investigated for classical and quantum information\nprocessing. In this work we propose to take advantage of strong light-matter\ncoupling, circular-symmetric confinement, and transverse-electric\ntransverse-magnetic splitting to exploit states where these two degrees of\nfreedom are combined. To this end we develop a model based on a spin-orbit\nPoincar\\'{e} hypersphere. Then we consider the example of semiconductor\npolariton systems and demonstrate full ultrafast Stark control of spin-orbit\nstates. Moreover, by controlling states on three different spin-orbit spheres\nand switching from one sphere to another we demonstrate the control of\ndifferent logic bits within one single physical system.\n", "  In this paper we consider conformal symmetry in the context of manifolds with\ngeneral affine connection. We extend the conformal transformation law of the\nmetric to a general metric compatible affine connection, and find that it is a\nsymmetry of both the geodesic equation and the Riemann tensor. We derive the\ngeneralised Jacobi equation and Raychaudhuri equation and show that they are\nboth conformally invariant. Using the geodesic deviation~(Jacobi) equation we\nanalyse the behaviour of geodesics in different conformal frames.\n  Since we find that our version of conformal symmetry is exact in classical\npure Einstein's gravity, we ask whether one can extend it to the standard\nmodel. We find that it is possible to write conformal invariant lagrangians in\nany dimensions for vector, fermion and scalar fields, but that such lagrangians\nare only gauge invariant in four dimensions. Provided one introduces a dilaton\nfield, gravity can be conformally coupled to matter.\n", "  Astrophotonics is the next-generation approach that provides the means to\nminiaturize near-infrared (NIR) spectrometers for upcoming large telescopes and\nmake them more robust and inexpensive. The target requirements for our\nspectrograph are: a resolving power of about 3000, wide spectral range (J and H\nbands), free spectral range of about 30 nm, high on-chip throughput of about\n80% (-1dB) and low crosstalk (high contrast ratio) between adjacent on-chip\nwavelength channels of less than 1% (-20dB). A promising photonic technology to\nachieve these requirements is Arrayed Waveguide Gratings (AWGs). We have\ndeveloped our first generation of AWG devices using a silica-on-silicon\nsubstrate with a very thin layer of silicon-nitride in the core of our\nwaveguides. The waveguide bending losses are minimized by optimizing the\ngeometry of the waveguides. Our first generation of AWG devices are designed\nfor H band and have a resolving power of around 1500 and free spectral range of\nabout 10 nm around a central wavelength of 1600 nm. The devices have a\nfootprint of only 12 mm x 6 mm. They are broadband (1450-1650 nm), have a peak\non-chip throughput of about 80% (-1 dB) and contrast ratio of about 1.5% (-18\ndB). These results confirm the robustness of our design, fabrication and\nsimulation methods. Currently, the devices are designed for Transverse Electric\n(TE) polarization and all the results are for TE mode. We are developing\nseparate J- and H-band AWGs with higher resolving power, higher throughput and\nlower crosstalk over a wider free spectral range to make them better suited for\nastronomical applications.\n", "  The Horndeski action is the most general scalar-tensor theory with at most\nsecond-order derivatives in the equations of motion, thus evading Ostrogradsky\ninstabilities and making it of interest when modifying gravity at large scales.\nTo pass local tests of gravity, these modifications predominantly rely on\nnonlinear screening mechanisms that recover Einstein's Theory of General\nRelativity in regions of high density. We derive a set of conditions on the\nfour free functions of the Horndeski action that examine whether a specific\nmodel embedded in the action possesses an Einstein gravity limit or not. For\nthis purpose, we develop a new and surprisingly simple scaling method that\nidentifies dominant terms in the equations of motion by considering formal\nlimits of the couplings that enter through the new terms in the modified\naction. This enables us to find regimes where nonlinear terms dominate and\nEinstein's field equations are recovered to leading order. Together with an\nefficient approximation of the scalar field profile, one can then further\nevaluate whether these limits can be attributed to a genuine screening effect.\nFor illustration, we apply the analysis to both a cubic galileon and a\nchameleon model as well as to Brans-Dicke theory. Finally, we emphasise that\nthe scaling method also provides a natural approach for performing\npost-Newtonian expansions in screened regimes.\n", "  We analyze the highly non-perturbative regime surrounding the Mott-Hubbard\nmetal-to-insulator transition (MIT) by means of dynamical mean field theory\ncalculations at the two-particle level. By extending the results of Sch\\\"afer,\net al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 246405 (2013)] we show the existence of\ninfinitely many lines in the phase diagram of the Hubbard model where the local\nBethe-Salpeter equations, and the related irreducible vertex functions, become\nsingular in the charge as well as the particle-particle channel. These\ndivergence lines accumulate around the critical Mott endpoint in accordance\nwith the interpretation as precursors of the MIT. By comparing our numerical\ndata with analytical calculations of increasing complexity, such as for the\ndisordered Binary Mixture and Falicov-Kimball (FK) models, as well as for the\natomic limit (AL) case, (i) we identify two different kinds of divergences\nlines; (ii) we classify them in terms of the frequency-structure of the\nassociated singular eigenvectors; (iii) we investigate their relation to the\nmultiple branches in the Luttinger-Ward formalism. Moreover, we could\ndistinguish the situations where the multiple divergences simply reflect the\nemergence of an underlying, unique energy scale $\\nu^*$ below which\nperturbation theory does no longer apply, from those where the breakdown of\nperturbation theory affects, not trivially, different energy regimes. Finally,\nwe discuss the implications of our results on the theoretical understanding of\nthe non-perturbative physics around the MIT and for future developments of\nmany-body algorithms applicable in this regime.\n", "  We present Herschel SPIRE Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) observations\nof N159W, an active star-forming region in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). In\nour observations, a number of far-infrared cooling lines including CO(4-3) to\nCO(12-11), [CI] 609 and 370 micron, and [NII] 205 micron are clearly detected.\nWith an aim of investigating the physical conditions and excitation processes\nof molecular gas, we first construct CO spectral line energy distributions\n(SLEDs) on 10 pc scales by combining the FTS CO transitions with ground-based\nlow-J CO data and analyze the observed CO SLEDs using non-LTE radiative\ntransfer models. We find that the CO-traced molecular gas in N159W is warm\n(kinetic temperature of 153-754 K) and moderately dense (H2 number density of\n(1.1-4.5)e3 cm-3). To assess the impact of the energetic processes in the\ninterstellar medium on the physical conditions of the CO-emitting gas, we then\ncompare the observed CO line intensities with the models of photodissociation\nregions (PDRs) and shocks. We first constrain the properties of PDRs by\nmodelling Herschel observations of [OI] 145, [CII] 158, and [CI] 370 micron\nfine-structure lines and find that the constrained PDR components emit very\nweak CO emission. X-rays and cosmic-rays are also found to provide a negligible\ncontribution to the CO emission, essentially ruling out ionizing sources\n(ultraviolet photons, X-rays, and cosmic-rays) as the dominant heating source\nfor CO in N159W. On the other hand, mechanical heating by low-velocity C-type\nshocks with ~10 km/s appears sufficient enough to reproduce the observed warm\nCO.\n", "  Much focus was on the possible slowing down of cosmic acceleration under the\ndark energy parametrization. In the present paper, we investigate this subject\nusing the Gaussian processes (GP), without resorting to a particular template\nof dark energy. The reconstruction is carried out by abundant data including\nluminosity distance from Union2, Union2.1 compilation and gamma-ray burst, and\ndynamical Hubble parameter. It suggests that slowing down of cosmic\nacceleration cannot be presented within 95\\% C.L., in considering the influence\nof spatial curvature and Hubble constant. In order to reveal the reason of\ntension between our reconstruction and previous parametrization constraint for\nUnion2 data, we compare them and find that slowing down of acceleration in some\nparametrization is only a \"mirage\". Although these parameterizations fits well\nwith the observational data, their tension can be revealed by high order\nderivative of distance $D$. Instead, GP method is able to faithfully model the\ncosmic expansion history.\n", "  We theoretically study the motion of a magnetic domain wall induced by\ntransverse elastic waves in a one-dimensional magnetic wire, which respects\nboth rotational and translational symmetries. By invoking the conservation of\nthe associated total angular and linear momenta, we are able to derive the\ntorque and the force on the domain wall exerted by the waves. We then show how\nferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic domain walls can be driven by circularly-\nand linear-polarized waves, respectively. We envision that elastic waves may\nprovide effective means to drive the dynamics of magnetic solitons in\ninsulators.\n", "  We investigated the electronic and optoelectronic properties of vertical van\nder Waals heterostructure photodetectors using layered p type GaSe and n type\nInSe, with graphene as the transparent electrodes. Not only the photocurrent\npeaks from the layered GaSe and InSe themselves were observed, also the\ninterlayer optical transition peak was observed, which is consistent with the\nfirst-principles calculation. The built-in electric field between p-n\nheterojunction and the advantage of the graphene electrodes can effectively\nseparate the photo-induced electron-hole pairs, and thus lead to the response\ntime down to 160 {\\mu}s. Making use of the interlayer as well as intralayer\noptical transitions of the vertical layered p-n heterostructure and graphene\nelectrodes, we could achieve high performance multi-color photodetectors based\non two-dimensional layered materials, which will be important for future\noptoelectronics.\n", "  In this letter, we compare optical light curves of two SN2002es-like Type Ia\nsupernovae, iPTF14atg and iPTF14dpk, from the intermediate Palomar Transient\nFactory. Although the two light curves resemble each other around and after\nmaximum, they show distinct early-phase rise behavior in the $\\textit{r}$-band.\nOn the one hand, iPTF14atg revealed a slow and steady rise which lasted for 22\ndays with a mean rise rate of $0.2\\sim0.3\\,\\textrm{mag}\\,\\textrm{day}^{-1}$,\nbefore it reached the $R$-band peak ($-18.05\\,$mag). On the other hand,\niPTF14dpk rose rapidly to $-17\\,$mag within a day of discovery with a rise rate\n$>1.8\\,\\textrm{mag}\\,\\textrm{day}^{-1}$, and then rose slowly to its peak\n($-18.19\\,$mag) with a rise rate similar to iPTF14atg. The apparent total rise\ntime of iPTF14dpk is therefore only 16 days. We show that emission from\niPTF14atg before $-17\\,$days with respect to its maximum can be entirely\nattributed to radiation produced by collision between the SN and its companion\nstar. Such emission is absent in iPTF14dpk probably because of an unfavored\nviewing angle, provided that SN2002es-like events arise from the same\nprogenitor channel. We further show that a SN2002es-like SN may experience a\ndark phase after the explosion but before its radioactively powered light curve\nbecomes visible. This dark phase may be hidden by radiation from\nsupernova-companion interaction.\n", "  Low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) are believed to be powered by\nan accretion-jet model, consisting of an inner advection-dominated accretion\nflow (ADAF), an outer truncated standard thin disk, and a jet. But model\ndegeneracy still exists in this framework. For example, the X-ray emission can\noriginate from either the ADAF or jet. The aim of the present work is to check\nthese models with the Faraday rotation measure (RM) observations recently\ndetected for two LLAGNs, M87 and 3C 84, in the sub-mm band. For M87, we find\nthat the RM predicted by the model in which the X-ray emission originates from\nthe ADAF is larger than the observed upper limit of RM by over two orders of\nmagnitude, while the model in which the X-ray emission originates from the jet\npredicts a RM lower than the observed upper limit. For 3C 84, the sub-mm\nemission is found to be dominated by the jet component, while the Faraday\nscreen is attributed to the ADAFs. This scenario can naturally explain the\nobserved {\\it external} origin of the RM and why RM is found to be stable\nduring a two-year interval although the sub-mm emission increases at the same\nperiod.\n", "  We report extensive numerical simulations of growth models belonging to the\nnonlinear molecular beam epitaxy (nMBE) class, on flat (fixed-size) and\nexpanding substrates (ES). In both $d=1+1$ and $2+1$, we find that growth\nregime height distributions (HDs), and spatial and temporal covariances are\nuniversal, but are dependent on the initial conditions, while the critical\nexponents are the same for flat and ES systems. Thus, the nMBE class does split\ninto subclasses, as does the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) class. Applying the \"KPZ\nansatz\" to nMBE models, we estimate the cumulants of the $1+1$ HDs. Spatial\ncovariance for the flat subclass is hallmarked by a minimum, which is not\npresent in the ES one. Temporal correlations are shown to decay following\nwell-known conjectures.\n", "  The detection of the events GW150914 and GW151226, both consistent with the\nmerger of a binary black hole system (BBH), opened the era of gravitational\nwave (GW) astronomy. Besides BBHs, the most promising GW sources are the\ncoalescences of binary systems formed by two neutron stars or a neutron star\nand a black hole. These mergers are thought to be connected with short Gamma\nRay Bursts (GRBs), therefore combined observations of GW and electromagnetic\n(EM) signals could definitively probe this association. We present a detailed\nstudy on the expectations for joint GW and high-energy EM observations of\ncoalescences of binary systems of neutron stars with Advanced Virgo and LIGO\nand with the \\emph{Fermi} gamma-ray telescope. To this scope, we designed a\ndedicated Montecarlo simulation pipeline for the multimessenger emission and\ndetection by GW and gamma-ray instruments, considering the evolution of the GW\ndetector sensitivities. We show that the expected rate of joint detection is\nlow during the Advanced Virgo and Advanced LIGO 2016-2017 run; however, as the\ninterferometers approach their final design sensitivities, the rate will\nincrease by $\\sim$ a factor of ten. Future joint observations will help to\nconstrain the association between short GRBs and binary systems and to solve\nthe puzzle of the progenitors of GWs. Comparison of the joint detection rate\nwith the ones predicted in this paper will help to constrain the geometry of\nthe GRB jet.\n", "  We present fully local versions of the minimally non-local nucleon-nucleon\npotentials constructed in a previous paper [M.\\ Piarulli {\\it et al.}, Phys.\\\nRev.\\ C {\\bf 91}, 024003 (2015)], and use them in hypersperical-harmonics and\nquantum Monte Carlo calculations of ground and excited states of $^3$H, $^3$He,\n$^4$He, $^6$He, and $^6$Li nuclei. The long-range part of these local\npotentials includes one- and two-pion exchange contributions without and with\n$\\Delta$-isobars in the intermediate states up to order $Q^3$ ($Q$ denotes\ngenerically the low momentum scale) in the chiral expansion, while the\nshort-range part consists of contact interactions up to order $Q^4$. The\nlow-energy constants multiplying these contact interactions are fitted to the\n2013 Granada database in two different ranges of laboratory energies, either\n0--125 MeV or 0--200 MeV, and to the deuteron binding energy and $nn$ singlet\nscattering length. Fits to these data are performed for three models\ncharacterized by long- and short-range cutoffs, $R_{\\rm L}$ and $R_{\\rm S}$\nrespectively, ranging from $(R_{\\rm L},R_{\\rm S})=(1.2,0.8)$ fm down to\n$(0.8,0.6)$ fm. The long-range (short-range) cutoff regularizes the one- and\ntwo-pion exchange (contact) part of the potential.\n", "  We study the decay mode of the $a_1(1260)$ into a $\\pi^+$ in p-wave and the\n$f_0(980)$ that decays into $\\pi^+ \\pi^-$ in s-wave. The mechanisms proceeds\nvia a triangular mechanism where the $a_1(1260)$ decays into $K^* \\bar K$, the\n$K^*$ decays to an external $\\pi^+$ and an internal $K$ that fuses with the\n$\\bar K$ to produce the $f_0(980)$ resonance. The mechanism develops a\nsingularity at a mass of the $a_1(1260)$ around 1420 MeV, producing a peak in\nthe cross section of the $\\pi p$ reaction, used to generate the mesonic final\nstate, which provides a natural explanation of all the features observed in the\nCOMPASS experiment, where a peak observed at this energy is tentatively\nassociated to a new resonance called $a_1(1420)$. On the other hand, the\ntriangular singularity studied here gives rise to a remarkable feature, where a\npeak is seen for a certain decay channel of a resonance at an energy about 200\nMeV higher than its nominal mass.\n", "  We report on the design and construction of a microlens-array (MLA)-based\npupil slicer and double scrambler for MAROON-X, a new fiber-fed, red-optical,\nhigh-precision radial-velocity spectrograph for one of the twin 6.5m Magellan\nTelescopes in Chile. We have constructed a 3X slicer based on a single\ncylindrical MLA and show that geometric efficiencies of >85% can be achieved,\nlimited by the fill factor and optical surface quality of the MLA. We present\nhere the final design of the 3x pupil slicer and double scrambler for MAROON-X,\nbased on a dual MLA design with (a)spherical lenslets. We also discuss the\ntechniques used to create a pseudo-slit of rectangular core fibers with low FRD\nlevels.\n", "  The Australian Astronomical Observatory's 'tilting spine' fibre positioning\ntechnology has been redeveloped to provide superior performance in a smaller\npackage. The new design offers demonstrated closed-loop positioning errors of\n2.8 {\\mu}m RMS in only five moves (~10 s excluding metrology overheads) and an\nimproved capacity for open-loop tracking during observations. Tilt-induced\nthroughput losses have been halved by lengthening spines while maintaining\nexcellent accuracy. New low-voltage multilayer piezo actuator technology has\nreduced a spine's peak drive amplitude from ~150 V to <10 V, simplifying the\ncontrol electronics design, reducing the system's overall size, and improving\nmodularity. Every spine is now a truly independent unit with a dedicated drive\ncircuit and no restrictions on the timing or direction of fibre motion.\n", "  We present a new approach to measuring cosmic expansion history and growth\nrate of large scale structure using the anisotropic two dimensional galaxy\ncorrelation function (2DCF) measured from data; it makes use of the empirical\nmodeling of small-scale galaxy clustering derived from numerical simulations by\nZheng et al. (2013). We validate this method using mock catalogues, before\napplying it to the analysis of the CMASS sample from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey Data Release 10 (DR10) of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey\n(BOSS). We find that this method enables accurate and precise measurements of\ncosmic expansion history and growth rate of large scale structure. Modeling the\n2DCF fully including nonlinear effects and redshift space distortions (RSD) in\nthe scale range of 16 to 144 Mpc/h, we find H(0.57)r_s(z_d)/c=0.0459 +/-\n0.0006, D_A(0.57)/r_s(z_d)=9.011 +/- 0.073, and f_g(0.57)\\sigma_8(0.57)=0.476\n+/- 0.050, which correspond to precisions of 1.3%, 0.8%, and 10.5%\nrespectively. We have defined r_s(z_d) to be the sound horizon at the drag\nepoch computed using a simple integral, f_g(z) as the growth rate at redshift\nz, and \\sigma_8(z) as the matter power spectrum normalization on 8Mpc/h scale\nat z. We find that neglecting the small-scale information significantly weakens\nthe constraints on H(z) and D_A(z), and leads to a biased estimate of f_g(z).\nOur results indicate that we can significantly tighten constraints on dark\nenergy and modified gravity by reliably modeling small-scale galaxy clustering.\n", "  Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) chips are widely used to measure association\nand dissociation rates for the binding kinetics between two species of\nchemicals, e.g., cell receptors and ligands. It is commonly assumed that\nligands are spatially well mixed in the SPR region, and hence a mean-field rate\nequation description is appropriate. This approximation however ignores the\nspatial fluctuations as well as temporal correlations induced by multiple local\nrebinding events, which become prominent for slow diffusion rates and high\nbinding affinities. We report detailed Monte Carlo simulations of ligand\nbinding kinetics in an SPR cell subject to laminar flow. We extract the binding\nand dissociation rates by means of the techniques frequently employed in\nexperimental analysis that are motivated by the mean-field approximation. We\nfind major discrepancies in a wide parameter regime between the thus extracted\nrates and the known input simulation values. These results underscore the\ncrucial quantitative importance of spatio-temporal correlations in binary\nreaction kinetics in SPR cell geometries, and demonstrate the failure of a\nmean-field analysis of SPR cells in the regime of high Damk\\\"ohler number Da >\n0.1, where the spatio-temporal correlations due to diffusive transport and\nligand-receptor rebinding events dominate the dynamics of SPR systems.\n", "  The global coupling of few-level quantum systems (\"spins\") to a discrete set\nof bosonic modes is a key ingredient for many applications in quantum science,\nincluding large-scale entanglement generation, quantum simulation of the\ndynamics of long-range interacting spin models, and hybrid platforms for force\nand spin sensing. We present a general numerical framework for treating the\nout-of-equilibrium dynamics of such models based on matrix product states. Our\napproach applies for generic spin-boson systems: it treats any spatial and\noperator dependence of the two-body spin-boson coupling and places no\nrestrictions on relative energy scales. We show that the full counting\nstatistics of collective spin measurements and infidelity of quantum simulation\ndue to spin-boson entanglement, both of which are difficult to obtain by other\ntechniques, are readily calculable in our approach. We benchmark our method\nusing a recently developed exact solution for a particular spin-boson coupling\nrelevant to trapped ion quantum simulators. Finally, we show how decoherence\ncan be incorporated within our framework using the method of quantum\ntrajectories, and study the dynamics of an open-system spin-boson model with\nspatially non-uniform spin-boson coupling relevant for trapped atomic ion\ncrystals in the presence of molecular ion impurities.\n", "  In Moln\\'ar et al. [Phys. Rev. D 93, 114025 (2016)] the equations of\nanisotropic dissipative fluid dynamics were obtained from the moments of the\nBoltzmann equation based on an expansion around an arbitrary anisotropic\nsingle-particle distribution function. In this paper we make a particular\nchoice for this distribution function and consider the boost-invariant\nexpansion of a fluid in one dimension. In order to close the conservation\nequations, we need to choose an additional moment of the Boltzmann equation. We\ndiscuss the influence of the choice of this moment on the time evolution of\nfluid-dynamical variables and identify the moment that provides the best match\nof anisotropic fluid dynamics to the solution of the Boltzmann equation in the\nrelaxation-time approximation.\n", "  We study the zero temperature BCS gaps for the triplet channel in pure\nneutron matter using Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG) evolved\ninteractions. We use the dependence of the results on the SRG resolution scale,\nas a tool to analyze medium and many-body corrections. In particular, we study\nthe effects of including the three-body interactions at leading order, which\nappear at N2LO in the Chiral EFT, as well as that of the first-order\nself-energy corrections on the zero temperature gap. In addition we also\nextract the transition temperature as a function of densities and verify the\nBCS scaling of the zero temperature gaps to the transition temperature. We\nobserve that the self-energy effects are very crucial in order to reduce the\nSRG resolution scale dependence of the results, while the three-body effects at\nthe leading order do not change the two-body resolution scale dependence. On\nthe other hand, the results depend strongly on the three-body cut-off,\nemphasizing the importance of the missing higher-order three-body effects. We\nalso observe that self-energy effects reduce the overall gap as well as shift\nthe gap closure to lower densities.\n", "  We study the effects of dilute La and Rh doping on the electronic structure\nof the relativistic Mott insulator Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ using fully relativistic and\nmagnetically non-collinear density functional theory with the inclusion of an\non-site Hubbard $U$. To model doping effects, we have adopted the supercell\napproach that allows for a realistic treatment of structural relaxations and\nelectronic effects beyond a purely rigid band approach. By means of the band\nunfolding technique we have computed the spectral function and constructed the\neffective band structure and Fermi surface (FS), which are readily comparable\nwith available experimental data. Our calculations clearly indicate that La and\nRh doping can be interpreted as effective electron and (fractional) hole\ndoping, respectively. In Sr$_{2-x}$La$_x$IrO$_4$ the IMT is accompanied by a\nmoderate renormalization of the electronic correlation substantiated by a\nreduction of the effective on-site Coulomb repulsion $U-J$ from 1.6 eV ($x=0$)\nto 1.4 eV (metallic regime $x=12.5\\%$). The progressive closing of the\nrelativistic Mott gap leads to the emergence of connected elliptical electron\npockets at ($\\pi$/2,$\\pi$/2) and less intense features at $X$ in the FS. The\nsubstitution of Ir with the nominally isovalent Rh is accompanied by a\nsubstantial hole transfer from the Rh site to the nearest neighbor Ir sites.\nThis shifts down the chemical potential, creates almost circular disconnected\nhole pockets in the FS and establishes the emergence of a two-dimensional\nmetallic state formed by conducting Rh-planes intercalated by insulating\nIr-planes. Finally, our data indicate that hole doping causes a flipping of the\nin-plane net ferromagnetic moment in the Rh plane and induces a magnetic\ntransition from the AF-I to the AF-II ordering.\n", "  In this work, we investigated the spin dynamics in a slab of chiral magnets\ninduced by an alternating (ac) spin current. Periodic trajectories of the\nskyrmion in real space are discovered under the ac current as a result of the\nMagnus and viscous forces, which originate from the Gilbert damping, the spin\ntransfer torque, and the $ \\beta $-nonadiabatic torque effects. The results are\nobtained by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation and can be\nexplained by the Thiele equation characterizing the skyrmion core motion.\n", "  We perform a comparative analysis of constraints on sterile neutrinos from\nthe Planck experiment and from current and future neutrino oscillation\nexperiments (MINOS, IceCube, SBN). For the first time, we express the Planck\nconstraints on $N_{\\rm eff}$ and $m_{\\rm eff}^{\\rm sterile}$ from the Cosmic\nMicrowave Background in the parameter space used by oscillation experiments\nusing both mass-squared differences and mixing angles. In a model with a single\nsterile neutrino species and using standard assumptions, we find that the\nPlanck data and the oscillation experiments measuring muon-neutrino\ndisappearance have similar sensitivity.\n", "  In quantum mechanics, wave functions and density matrices represent our\nknowledge about a quantum system and give probabilities for the outcomes of\nmeasurements. If the combined dynamics and measurements on a system lead to a\ndensity matrix $\\rho(t)$ with only diagonal elements in a given basis\n$\\{|n\\rangle\\}$, it may be treated as a classical mixture, i.e., a system which\nrandomly occupies the basis states $|n\\rangle$ with probabilities\n$\\rho_{nn}(t)$. Fully equivalent to so-called smoothing in classical\nprobability theory, subsequent probing of the occupation of the states\n$|n\\rangle$ improves our ability to retrodict what was the outcome of a\nprojective state measurement at time $t$. Here, we show with experiments on a\nsuperconducting qubit that the smoothed probabilities do not, in the same way\nas the diagonal elements of $\\rho$, permit a classical mixture interpretation\nof the state of the system at the past time $t$.\n", "  In this article, we focus on a new scalar $\\phi$ mediated scalar/vectorial\nWIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles) with $\\phi$'s mass slightly below\nthe WIMP mass. To explain the Galactic center 1 - 3 GeV gamma-ray excess, here\nwe consider the case that a WIMP pair predominantly annihilates into an\non-shell $\\phi \\phi$ pair with $\\phi$ mainly decaying to $\\tau \\bar{\\tau}$. The\nmasses of WIMPs are in a range about 14 - 22 GeV, and the annihilations of\nWIMPs are phase space suppressed today. In this annihilation scheme, the\ncouplings of the $\\phi$ - standard model (SM) particles are almost arbitrary\nsmall, and the WIMP-nucleus spin-independent scattering can be tolerant by the\npresent dark matter (DM) direct detections. A scalar mediator-Higgs field\nmixing is introduced, which is small and available. The lower limit on the\ncouplings of the $\\phi$-SM particles set by the thermal equilibrium in the\nearly universe is derived, and this constraint is above the neutrino background\nfor scalar DM in direct detections. The WIMPs may be detectable at the upgraded\nDM direct detection experiment in the next few years, and the exotic decay $h\n\\rightarrow \\phi \\phi$, the production of $\\phi$ may be observable at future\nhigh-luminosity $e^+ e^-$ collider.\n", "  Context: Research on supernovae (SNe) over the past decade has confirmed that\nthere is a distinct class of events which are much more luminous (by $\\sim2$\nmag) than canonical core-collapse SNe (CCSNe). These events with visual peak\nmagnitudes $\\lesssim-21$ are called superluminous SNe (SLSNe). Aims: There are\na few intermediate events which have luminosities between these two classes.\nHere we study one such object, SN 2012aa. Methods: The optical photometric and\nspectroscopic follow-up observations of the event were conducted over a time\nspan of about 120 days. Results: With V_abs at peak ~-20 mag, the SN is an\nintermediate-luminosity transient between regular SNe Ibc and SLSNe. It also\nexhibits an unusual secondary bump after the maximum in its light curve. We\ninterpret this as a manifestation of SN-shock interaction with the CSM. If we\nwould assume a $^{56}$Ni-powered ejecta, the bolometric light curve requires\nroughly 1.3 M_sun of $^{56}$Ni and an ejected mass of ~14 M_sun. This would\nalso imply a high kinetic energy of the explosion, ~5.4$\\times10^{51}$ ergs. On\nthe other hand, the unusually broad light curve along with the secondary peak\nindicate the possibility of interaction with CSM. The third alternative is the\npresence of a central engine releasing spin energy that eventually powers the\nlight curve over a long time. The host of the SN is a star-forming Sa/Sb/Sbc\ngalaxy. Conclusions: Although the spectral properties and velocity evolution of\nSN 2012aa are comparable to those of normal SNe Ibc, its broad light curve\nalong with a large peak luminosity distinguish it from canonical CCSNe,\nsuggesting the event to be an intermediate-luminosity transient between CCSNe\nand SLSNe at least in terms of peak luminosity. We argue that SN 2012aa belongs\nto a subclass where CSM interaction plays a significant role in powering the\nSN, at least during the initial stages of evolution.\n", "  It is shown that the Truncated Euler Equations, i.e. a finite set of ordinary\ndifferential equations for the amplitude of the large-scale modes, can\ncorrectly describe the complex transitional dynamics that occur within the\nturbulent regime of a confined 2D Navier-Stokes flow with bottom friction and a\nspatially periodic forcing. In particular, the random reversals of the large\nscale circulation on the turbulent background involve bifurcations of the\nprobability distribution function of the large-scale circulation velocity that\nare described by the related microcanonical distribution which displays\ntransitions from gaussian to bimodal and broken ergodicity. A minimal 13-mode\nmodel reproduces these results.\n", "  We investigated, using spectral-timing analysis, the characterization of\nhighly ionized outflows in Seyfert galaxies, the so-called warm absorbers.\nHere, we present our results on the extensive ~ 600 ks of XMM-Newton archival\nobservations of the bright and highly variable Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051, whose\nspectrum has revealed a complex multicomponent wind. Making use of both RGS and\nEPIC-pn data, we performed a detailed analysis through a time-dependent\nphotoionization code in combination with spectral and Fourier spectral-timing\ntechniques. The source light curves and the warm absorber parameters obtained\nfrom the data were used to simulate the response of the gas due to variations\nin the ionizing flux of the central source. The resulting time variable spectra\nwere employed to predict the effects of the warm absorber on the time lags and\ncoherence of the energy dependent light curves. We have found that, in the\nabsence of any other lag mechanisms, a warm absorber with the characteristics\nof the one observed in NGC 4051, is able to produce soft lags, up to 100 s, on\ntimescales of ~ hours. The time delay is associated with the response of the\ngas to changes in the ionizing source, either by photoionization or radiative\nrecombination, which is dependent on its density. The range of radial distances\nthat, under our assumptions, yield longer time delays are comparable to the\nexisting estimates of the location of the warm absorber in NGC 4051. For this\nreason, we suggest that it is likely that the observed X-ray time lags may\ncarry a signature of the warm absorber response time, to changes in the\nionizing continuum. These results highlight the importance of understanding the\ncontribution of the warm absorber to the AGN X-ray time lags, since it is also\nvital information for interpreting the lags associated with propagation and\nreverberation effects in the inner emitting regions.\n", "  We investigate various types of Fubini instantons in Dilatonic\nEinstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory of gravitation, which describe the decay of the\nvacuum state at a hilltop potential through the tunneling without a barrier. It\nis shown that the vacuum states are modified by the non-minimally coupled\nhigher-curvature term. Accordingly, we present the new type of solutions\ndescribing the tunneling from new vacuum states in anti-de Sitter and de Sitter\nbackgrounds. The decay probabilities of vacuum states are also influenced.\nConsequently, we show that the semiclassical exponents can be decreased for\nspecific parameter ranges, which make the tunneling probabilities enhanced.\n", "  General features of spontaneous baryogenesis are studied. The relation\nbetween the time derivative of the (pseudo)goldstone field and the baryonic\nchemical potential is revisited. It is shown that this relation essentially\ndepends upon the representation chosen for the fermionic fields with non-zero\nbaryonic number (quarks). The calculations of the cosmological baryon asymmetry\nare based on the kinetic equation generalized to the case of non-stationary\nbackground. The effects of the finite interval of the integration over time are\nalso included into consideration. All these effects combined lead to a\nnoticeable deviation of the magnitude of the baryon asymmetry from the\ncanonical results.\n", "  After having demonstrated that an IFU, attached to a microscope rather than\nto a telescope, is capable of differentiating complex organic tissue with\nspatially resolved Raman spectroscopy, we have launched a clinical validation\nprogram that utilizes a novel optimized fiber-coupled multi-channel\nspectrograph whose layout is based on the modular MUSE spectrograph concept.\nThe new design features a telecentric input and has an extended blue\nperformance, but otherwise maintains the properties of high throughput and\nexcellent image quality over an octave of wavelength coverage with modest\nspectral resolution. We present the opto-mechanical layout and details of its\noptical performance.\n", "  Astrophysical environments that reach temperatures greater than $\\sim$ 100\nkeV can have significant neutrino energy loss via both plasma processes and\nnuclear weak interactions. We find that nuclear processes likely produce the\nhighest-energy neutrinos. Among the important weak nuclear interactions are\nboth charged current channels (electron capture/emission and positron\ncapture/emission) and neutral current channels (de-excitation of nuclei via\nneutrino pair emission). We show that in order to make a realistic prediction\nof the nuclear neutrino spectrum, one must take nuclear structure into account;\nin some cases, the most important transitions may involve excited states,\npossibly in both parent and daughter nuclei. We find that the standard\ntechnique of producing a neutrino energy spectrum by using a single transition\nwith a Q-value and matrix element chosen to fit published neutrino production\nrates and energy losses will not accurately capture important spectral\nfeatures.\n", "  Coronagraphy is a very efficient technique for identifying and characterizing\nextra-solar planets orbiting in the habitable zone of their parent star,\nespecially when used in a space environment. An important family of\ncoronagraphs is based on phase plates located at an intermediate image plane of\nthe optical system, that spread the starlight outside the \"Lyot\" exit pupil\nplane of the instrument. In this communication we present a set of candidate\nphase functions generating a central null at the Lyot plane, and study how it\npropagates to the image plane of the coronagraph. These functions include\nlinear azimuthal phase ramps (the well-known optical vortex), azimuthally\ncosine-modulated phase profiles, and circular phase gratings. Numerical\nsimulations of the expected null depth, inner working angle, sensitivity to\npointing errors, effect of central obscuration located at the pupil or image\nplanes, and effective throughput including image mask and Lyot stop\ntransmissions are presented and discussed. The preliminary conclusion is that\nazimuthal cosine functions appear as an interesting alternative to the\nclassical optical vortex of integer topological charge.\n", "  We investigate two recent parameterizations of the galactic magnetic field\nwith respect to their impact on cosmic nuclei traversing the field. We present\na comprehensive study of the size of angular deflections, dispersion in the\narrival probability distributions, multiplicity in the images of arrival on\nEarth, variance in field transparency, and influence of the turbulent field\ncomponents. To remain restricted to ballistic deflections, a cosmic nucleus\nwith energy E and charge Z should have a rigidity above E/Z=6 EV. In view of\nthe differences resulting from the two field parameterizations as a measure of\ncurrent knowledge in the galactic field, this rigidity threshold may have to be\nincreased. For a point source search with E/Z>60 EV, field uncertainties\nincrease the required signal events for discovery moderately for sources in the\nnorthern and southern regions, but substantially for sources near the galactic\ndisk.\n", "  We apply the Noether procedure for gauging space-time symmetries to theories\nwith Galilean symmetries, analyzing both massless and massive (Bargmann)\nrealizations. It is shown that at the linearized level the Noether procedure\ngives rise to (linearized) torsional Newton-Cartan geometry. In the case of\nBargmann theories the Newton-Cartan form $M_\\mu$ couples to the conserved mass\ncurrent. We show that even in the case of theories with massless Galilean\nsymmetries it is necessary to introduce the form $M_\\mu$ and that it couples to\na topological current. Further, we show that the Noether procedure naturally\ngives rise to a distinguished affine (Christoffel type) connection that is\nlinear in $M_\\mu$ and torsionful. As an application of these techniques we\nstudy the coupling of Galilean electrodynamics to TNC geometry at the\nlinearized level.\n", "  The energy dependence is investigated for a wide set of space-time\ncharacteristics derived from Bose - Einstein correlations of secondary pion\npairs produced in proton-proton and nucleus-nucleus interactions. Analytic\nfunctions suggested for smooth approximations of the energy dependence of\nemission region parameters demonstrate reasonable agreement with all available\nexperimental results for proton-proton collisions while the approximations\ncorrespond to most of experimental data for nucleus-nucleus collisions at\nenergies above 5 GeV. Estimations for a wide set of space-time quantities are\nobtained for energies for the Future Circular Collider (FCC) project based on\nthe smooth approximations. The space particle densities at freeze-out are\nderived also from estimations for the volume of the emission region and for\ntotal multiplicity at FCC energies. Estimations for charged particle density\nand its critical value allow the possibility of lasing behavior for secondary\npions in nucleus-nucleus collisions at FCC energy. The mathematical formalism\nis presented for study of the peak shape of correlation function for general\ncase of central-symmetrical Levy - Feldheim distribution.\n", "  The Square Kilometre Array Telescope Manager (SKA TM) will be responsible for\nassisting the SKA Operations and Observation Management, carrying out System\ndiagnosis and collecting Monitoring & Control data from the SKA sub-systems and\ncomponents. To provide adequate compute resources, scalability, operation\ncontinuity and high availability, as well as strict Quality of Service, the TM\ncyber-infrastructure (embodied in the Local Infrastructure - LINFRA) consists\nof COTS hardware and infrastructural software (for example: server monitoring\nsoftware, host operating system, virtualization software, device firmware),\nproviding a specially tailored Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform\nas a Service (PaaS) solution. The TM infrastructure provides services in the\nform of computational power, software defined networking, power, storage\nabstractions, and high level, state of the art IaaS and PaaS management\ninterfaces. This cyber platform will be tailored to each of the two SKA Phase 1\ntelescopes (SKA_MID in South Africa and SKA_LOW in Australia) instances, each\npresenting different computational and storage infrastructures and conditioned\nby location. This cyber platform will provide a compute model enabling TM to\nmanage the deployment and execution of its multiple components (observation\nscheduler, proposal submission tools, M&C components, Forensic tools and\nseveral Databases, etc). In this sense, the TM LINFRA is primarily focused\ntowards the provision of isolated instances, mostly resorting to virtualization\ntechnologies, while defaulting to bare hardware if specifically required due to\nperformance, security, availability, or other requirement.\n", "  We discuss the thermodynamics of the O(3) nonlinear sigma model in 1+1\ndimensions at nonzero chemical potential (equivalent to a magnetic field). In\nits conventional field theory representation the model suffers from a sign\nproblem. By dualizing the lattice model we present, for the first time, nonzero\ndensity data of an asymptotically free theory with dynamical mass-gap. We find\na quantum phase transition at zero temperature where as a function of the\nchemical potential the density assumes a nonzero value. We present evidence for\na corresponding dynamical critical exponent z close to 2. The low energy O(3)\nmodel is conjectured to be described by a massive boson triplet with repulsive\ninteractions. We confirm the universal square root behavior expected for such a\nsystem at low density (and temperature) and compare our data to the results of\nBethe ansatz solutions of the relativistic and non-relativistic one-dimensional\nBose gas. We also comment on a potential Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless\ntransition at nonzero density.\n", "  We report on the scrambling performance and focal-ratio-degradation (FRD) of\nvarious octagonal and rectangular fibers considered for MAROON-X. Our\nmeasurements demonstrate the detrimental effect of thin claddings on the FRD of\noctagonal and rectangular fibers and that stress induced at the connectors can\nfurther increase the FRD. We find that fibers with a thick, round cladding show\nlow FRD. We further demonstrate that the scrambling behavior of non-circular\nfibers is often complex and introduce a new metric to fully capture non-linear\nscrambling performance, leading to much lower scrambling gain values than are\ntypically reported in the literature (<1000 compared to 10,000 or more). We\nfind that scrambling gain measurements for small-core, non-circular fibers are\noften speckle dominated if the fiber is not agitated.\n", "  Optical fibers are a key component for high-resolution spectrographs to\nattain high precision in radial velocity measurements. We present a custom\nfiber with a novel core geometry - a 'D'-shape. From a theoretical standpoint,\nsuch a fiber should provide superior scrambling and modal noise mitigation,\nsince unlike the commonly used circular and polygonal fiber cross sections, it\nshows chaotic scrambling. We report on the fabrication process of a test fiber\nand compare the optical properties, scrambling performance, and modal noise\nbehavior of the D-fiber with those of common polygonal fibers.\n", "  This theoretical paper discusses microscopic models giving rise to special\ntypes of order in which conduction electrons are bound together with localized\nspins to create composite order parameters. It is shown that composite order is\nrelated to the formation of a spin liquid with gapped excitations carrying\nquantum numbers which are a fraction of those of electron. These spin liquids\nare special in the sense that their formation necessarily involves spin degrees\nof freedom of both the conduction and the localized electrons. A detailed\ndescription of such spin liquid states is presented with a special emphasize on\na demonstration of their robustness against local perturbations preserving the\nLie group symmetry and the translational invariance.\n", "  We present theoretical investigations of pressure and temperature driven\nphase transitions in HgTe quantum wells grown on CdTe buffer. Using the 8-band\n\\textbf{k$\\cdot$p} Hamiltonian we calculate evolution of energy band structure\nat different quantum well width with hydrostatic pressure up to 20 kBar and\ntemperature ranging up 300 K. In particular, we show that in addition to\ntemperature, tuning of hydrostatic pressure allows to drive transitions between\nsemimetal, band insulator and topological insulator phases. Our realistic band\nstructure calculations reveal that the band inversion under hydrostatic\npressure and temperature may be accompanied by non-local overlapping between\nconduction and valence bands. The pressure and temperature phase diagrams are\npresented.\n", "  The Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) links the stellar mass of a disk galaxy,\n$M_{\\rm str}$, to its rotation speed: it is well approximated by a power law,\nshows little scatter, and evolves weakly with redshift. The relation has been\ninterpreted as reflecting the mass-velocity scaling ($M\\propto V^3$) of dark\nmatter halos, but this interpretation has been called into question by\nabundance-matching (AM) models, which predict the galaxy-halo mass relation to\nbe non-monotonic and rapidy evolving. We study the TFR of luminous spirals and\nits relation to AM using the EAGLE set of $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological\nsimulations. Matching both relations requires disk sizes to satisfy constraints\ngiven by the concentration of halos and their response to galaxy assembly.\nEAGLE galaxies approximately match these constraints and show a tight\nmass-velocity scaling that compares favourably with the observed TFR. The TFR\nis degenerate to changes in galaxy formation efficiency and the mass-size\nrelation; simulations that fail to match the galaxy stellar mass function may\nfit the observed TFR if galaxies follow a different mass-size relation. The\nsmall scatter in the simulated TFR results because, at fixed halo mass, galaxy\nmass and rotation speed correlate strongly, scattering galaxies along the main\nrelation. EAGLE galaxies evolve with lookback time following approximately the\nprescriptions of AM models and the observed mass-size relation of bright\nspirals, leading to a weak TFR evolution consistent with observation out to\n$z=1$. $\\Lambda$CDM models that match both the abundance and size of galaxies\nas a function of stellar mass have no difficulty reproducing the observed TFR\nand its evolution.\n", "  This paper reports on the modal noise characterisation of a hybrid\nreformatter. The device consists of a multicore-fibre photonic lantern and an\nultrafast laser-inscribed slit reformatter. It operates around 1550 nm and\nsupports 92 modes. Photonic lanterns transform a multimode signal into an array\nof single-mode signals, and thus combine the high coupling efficiency of\nmultimode fibres with the diffraction-limited performance of single-mode\nfibres. This paper presents experimental measurements of the device point\nspread function properties under different coupling conditions, and its\nthroughput behaviour at high spectral resolution. The device demonstrates\nexcellent scrambling but its point spread function is not completely stable.\nMode field diameter and mode barycentre position at the device output vary as\nthe multicore-fibre is agitated due to the fabrication imperfections.\n", "  Observations of stellar surfaces - except for the Sun - are hampered by their\ntiny angular extent, while observed spectral lines are smeared by averaging\nover the stellar surface, and by stellar rotation. Exoplanet transits can be\nused to analyze stellar atmospheric structure, yielding high-resolution spectra\nacross spatially highly resolved stellar surfaces, free from effects of spatial\nsmearing and the rotational wavelength broadening present in full-disk spectra.\nDuring a transit, stellar surface portions successively become hidden, and\ndifferential spectroscopy between various transit phases provides spectra of\nthose surface segments then hidden behind the planet. The small area subtended\nby even a large planet (about 1% of a main-sequence star) offers high spatial\nresolution but demands very precise observations. We demonstrate the\nreconstruction of photospheric FeI line profiles at a spectral resolution\nR=80,000 across the surface of the solar-type star HD209458. Any detailed\nunderstanding of stellar atmospheres requires modeling with 3-dimensional\nhydrodynamics. The properties predicted by such models are mapped onto the\nprecise spectral-line shapes, asymmetries and wavelength shifts, and their\nvariation from the center to the limb across any stellar disk. This method\nprovides a tool for testing and verifying such models. The method will soon\nbecome applicable to more diverse types of stars, thanks to new spectrometers\non very large telescopes, and since ongoing photometric searches are expected\nto discover additional bright host stars of transiting exoplanets.\n", "  The UV LED mission demonstrates the precise control of the potential of\nelectrically isolated test masses that is essential for the operation of space\naccelerometers and drag free sensors. Accelerometers and drag free sensors were\nand remain at the core of geodesy, aeronomy, and precision navigation missions\nas well as gravitational science experiments and gravitational wave\nobservatories. Charge management using photoelectrons generated by the 254 nm\nUV line of Hg was first demonstrated on Gravity Probe B and is presently part\nof the LISA Pathfinder technology demonstration. The UV LED mission and prior\nground testing demonstrates that AlGaN UV LEDs operating at 255 nm are superior\nto Mercury vapor lamps because of their smaller size, lower draw, higher\ndynamic range, and higher control authority. We show flight data from a small\nsatellite mission on a Saudi Satellite that demonstrates AC charge control (UV\nLEDs and bias are AC modulated with adjustable relative phase) between a\nspherical test mass and its housing. The result of the mission is to bring the\nUV LED device Technology Readiness Level (TRL) to TRL 9 and the charge\nmanagement system to TRL 7. We demonstrate the ability to control the test mass\npotential on an 89 mm diameter spherical test mass over a 20 mm gap in a drag\nfree system configuration. The test mass potential was measured with an ultra\nhigh impedance contact probe. Finally, the key electrical and optical\ncharacteristics of the UV LEDs showed less than 7.5 percent change in\nperformance after 12 months in orbit.\n", "  Using the classical field method, we study numerically the characteristics\nand decay of the turbulent tangle of superfluid vortices which is created in\nthe evolution of a Bose gas from highly nonequilibrium initial conditions. By\nanalysing the vortex line density, the energy spectrum and the velocity\ncorrelation function, we determine that the turbulence resulting from this\neffective thermal quench lacks the coherent structures and the Kolmogorov\nscaling; these properties are typical of both ordinary classical fluids and of\nsuperfluid helium when driven by grids or propellers. Instead, thermal quench\nturbulence has properties akin to a random flow, more similar to another\nturbulent regime called ultra-quantum turbulence which has been observed in\nsuperfluid helium.\n", "  We construct a cosmological scalar-tensor-theory model in which the\nBrans-Dicke type scalar $\\Phi$ enters the effective (Jordan-frame) Hubble rate\nas a simple modification of the Hubble rate of the $\\Lambda$CDM model. This\nallows us to quantify differences between the background dynamics of\nscalar-tensor theories and general relativity (GR) in a transparent and\nobservationally testable manner in terms of one single parameter. Problems of\nthe mapping of the scalar-field degrees of freedom on an effective fluid\ndescription in a GR context are discused. Data from supernovae, the\ndifferential age of old galaxies and baryon acoustic oscillations are shown to\nstrongly limit potential deviations from the standard model.\n", "  We investigate the photo-induced spin dynamics of single nitrogen-vacancy\n(NV) centres in diamond near the electronic ground state level anti-crossing\n(GSLAC), which occurs at an axial magnetic field around 1024 G. Using optically\ndetected magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we first find that the electron spin\ntransition frequency can be tuned down to 100 kHz for the \\NV{14} centre, while\nfor the \\NV{15} centre the transition strength vanishes for frequencies below\nabout 2 MHz owing to the GSLAC level structure. Using optical pulses to prepare\nand readout the spin state, we observe coherent spin oscillations at 1024 G for\nthe \\NV{14}, which originate from spin mixing induced by residual transverse\nmagnetic fields. This effect is responsible for limiting the smallest\nobservable transition frequency, which can span two orders of magnitude from\n100 kHz to tens of MHz depending on the local magnetic noise. A similar feature\nis observed for the \\NV{15} centre at 1024 G. As an application of these\nfindings, we demonstrate all-optical detection and spectroscopy of\nexternally-generated fluctuating magnetic fields at frequencies from 8 MHz down\nto 500 kHz, using a \\NV{14} centre. Since the Larmor frequency of most nuclear\nspin species lies within this frequency range near the GSLAC, these results\npave the way towards all-optical, nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance\nspectroscopy, using longitudinal spin cross-relaxation.\n", "  We study radial vibrations of spherically symmetric skyrmions in the BPS\nSkyrme model. Concretely, we numerically solve the linearised field equations\nfor small fluctuations in a skyrmion background, both for linearly stable\noscillations and for (unstable) resonances. This is complemented by numerical\nsolutions of the full nonlinear system, which confirm all the results of the\nlinear analysis. In all cases, the resulting fundamental excitation provides a\nrather accurate value for the Roper resonance, supporting the hypothesis that\nthe BPS Skyrme model already gives a reasonable approximate description of this\nresonance. Further, for many potentials additional higher resonances appear,\nagain in agreement with known experimental results.\n", "  We study the critical behavior of the entropy production of the Ising model\nsubject to a magnetic field that oscillates in time. The mean-field model\ndisplays a phase transition that can be either first or second-order, depending\non the amplitude of the field and on the frequency of oscillation. Within this\napproximation the entropy production rate is shown to have a discontinuity when\nthe transition is first-order and to be continuous, with a jump in its first\nderivative, if the transition is second-order. In two dimensions, we find with\nnumerical simulations that the critical behavior of the entropy production rate\nis the same, independent of the frequency and amplitude of the field. Its first\nderivative has a logarithmic divergence at the critical point. This result is\nin agreement with the lack of a first-order phase transition in two dimensions.\nWe analyze a model with a field that changes at stochastic time-intervals\nbetween two values. This model allows for an informational theoretic\ninterpretation, with the system as a sensor that follows the external field. We\ncalculate numerically a lower bound on the learning rate, which quantifies how\nmuch information the system obtains about the field. Its first derivative with\nrespect to temperature is found to have a jump at the critical point.\n", "  We have studied zero temperature metastable states in classical $m$-vector\ncomponent spin glasses in the presence of $m$-component random fields (of\nstrength $h_{r}$) for a variety of models, including the Sherrington\nKirkpatrick (SK) model, the Viana Bray (VB) model and the randomly diluted\none-dimensional models with long-range power law interactions. For the SK model\nwe have calculated analytically its complexity (the log of the number of\nminima) for both the annealed case and the quenched case, both for fields above\nand below the de Almeida Thouless (AT) field ($h_{AT} > 0$ for $m>2$). We have\ndone quenches starting from a random initial state by putting spins parallel to\ntheir local fields until convergence and found that in zero field it always\nproduces minima which have zero overlap with each other. For the $m=2$ and\n$m=3$ cases in the SK model the final energy reached in the quench is very\nclose to the energy $E_c$ at which the overlap of the states would acquire\nreplica symmetry breaking features. These minima have marginal stability and\nwill have long-range correlations between them. In the SK limit we have\nanalytically studied the density of states $\\rho(\\lambda)$ of the Hessian\nmatrix in the annealed approximation. Despite the absence of continuous\nsymmetries, the spectrum extends down to zero with the usual $\\sqrt{\\lambda}$\nform for the density of states for $h_{r}<h_{AT}$. However, when\n$h_{r}>h_{AT}$, there is a gap in the spectrum which closes up as $h_{AT}$ is\napproached. For the VB model and the other models our numerical work shows that\nthere always exist some low-lying eigenvalues and there never seems to be a\ngap. There is no sign of the AT transition in the quenched states reached from\ninfinite temperature for any model but the SK model, which is the only model\nwhich has zero complexity above $h_{AT}$.\n", "  Employing the so-called hybrid formalism, we calculate the cross section of\ninclusive hadron production in proton-proton collisions at forward rapidity in\nsmall-$x$ formalism at one-loop order. For the case of hadron production at\nforward rapidity, we can uses collinear parton distributions for projectile\nproton and $k_\\perp$ dependent gluon distribution for target proton. We show\nthat collinear divergences associated with initial and final state parton\nradiations are renormalized into parton distributions and fragmentation\nfunctions in terms of the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi evolution\nequation, respectively. Furthermore, rapidity divergence can be absorbed into\nthe wave function of target proton which gives rise to the well-known\nBalitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov equation. These divergences are completely\nseparated from the short distance partonic hard parts, which is now finite at\nthe next-to-leading order accuracy. The result presented in this paper can be\nreckoned as a baseline calculation without any non-linear QCD effects in\nsmall-$x$ formalism. As a consistency check, we compare our results with the\nprevious calculation for non-linear proton-nucleus collisions in the small-$x$\nformalism and find complete agreement in the dilute and large $N_c$ limit. In\nphenomenology, the direct comparison of the above two separate calculations can\nreveal the role and strength of the non-linear dynamics in high energy QCD, and\nthus help us reliably study the onset of gluon saturation when genuine\nnon-linear interactions become important.\n", "  More than $3\\sigma$ deviations from the standard model are observed in the\nangular observable $P'_5$ of $B\\to K^* \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ and muon $g-2$. To resolve\nthese anomalies, we extend the standard model by adding two leptoquarks. It is\nfound that the signal strength of the diphoton Higgs decay can exhibit a\nsignificant deviation from unity and is within the data errors. Although\n$\\ell_i \\to \\ell_j \\gamma$ puts severe bounds on some couplings, it is found\nthat the excesses of $P'_5$ and muon $g-2$ can still be explained and can be\naccommodated to the measurement of $B_s\\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ in this model. In\naddition, the leptoquark effects can also explain the LHCb measurement of $R_K\n= BR(B^+ \\to K^+ \\mu^+\\mu^-)/BR(B^+ \\to K^+ e^+e^-)=0.745^{+0.090}_{-0.074} \\pm\n0.036$, which shows a $2.6\\sigma$ deviation from the standard model prediction.\n", "  The existence of charge density wave (CDW) correlations in cuprate\nsuperconductors has now been established. However, the nature of the ground\nstate order has remained uncertain because disorder and the presence of\nsuperconductivity typically limit the CDW correlation lengths to a dozen unit\ncells or less. Here we explore the CDW correlations in YBa2Cu3Ox (YBCO)\northo-II and ortho-VIII crystals, which belong to the cleanest available\ncuprate family, at magnetic fields in excess of the resistive upper critical\nfield (Hc2) where the superconductivity is heavily suppressed. We find an\nincommensurate, unidirectional CDW with a well-defined onset at a critical\nfield strength that is proportional to Hc2. It is related to but distinct from\nthe short-range bidirectional CDW that exists at zero magnetic field. The\nunidirectional CDW possesses a long inplane correlation length as well as\nsignificant correlations between neighboring CuO2 planes, yielding a\ncorrelation volume that is at least 2 - 3 orders of magnitude larger than that\nof the zero-field CDW. This is by far the largest CDW correlation volume\nobserved in any cuprate crystal and so is presumably representative of the\nhigh-field ground-state of an \"ideal\" disorder-free cuprate.\n", "  We investigate a simple model using the numerical simulation in the complex\nLangevin equation (CLE) and the analytical approximation with the Gaussian\nAnsatz. We find that the Gaussian Ansatz captures the essential and even\nquantitative features of the CLE results quite well including unwanted behavior\nin the unstable region where the CLE converges to a wrong answer. The Gaussian\nAnsatz is therefore useful for looking into this convergence problem and we\nfind that the exact answer in the unstable region is nicely reproduced by\nanother solution that is naively excluded from the stability condition. We\nconsider the Gaussian probability distributions corresponding to multiple\nsolutions along the Lefschetz thimble to discuss the stability and the\nlocality. Our results suggest a prescription to improve the convergence of the\nCLE simulation to the exact answer.\n", "  In general relativity, relativistic gravity gradiometry involves the\nmeasurement of the relativistic tidal matrix, which is theoretically obtained\nfrom the projection of the Riemann curvature tensor onto the orthonormal tetrad\nframe of an observer. The observer's 4-velocity vector defines its local\ntemporal axis and its local spatial frame is defined by a set of three\northonormal nonrotating gyro directions. The general tidal matrix for the\ntimelike geodesics of Kerr spacetime has been calculated by Marck\\cite{Marck}.\nWe are interested in the measured components of the curvature tensor along the\ninclined \"circular\" geodesic orbit of a test mass about a slowly rotating\nastronomical object of mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$. Therefore, we\nspecialize Marck's results to such a \"circular\" orbit that is tilted with\nrespect to the equatorial plane of the Kerr source. To linear order in $J$, we\nrecover the Mashhoon--Theiss effect, which is due to a small denominator\n(\"resonance\") phenomenon involving the frequency of geodetic precession. The\nMashhoon--Theiss effect shows up as a special long-period gravitomagnetic part\nof the relativistic tidal matrix. The physical interpretation of this effect is\nbriefly discussed.\n", "  Based on mesoscale lattice Boltzmann simulations with the \"Shan-Chen\" model,\nwe explore the influence of thermocapillarity on the break-up properties of\nfluid threads in a microfluidic T-junction, where a dispersed phase is injected\nperpendicularly into a main channel containing a continuous phase, and the\nlatter induces periodic break-up of droplets due to the cross-flowing.\nTemperature effects are investigated by switching on/off both positive/negative\ntemperature gradients along the main channel direction, thus promoting a\ndifferent thread dynamics with anticipated/delayed break-up. Numerical\nsimulations are performed at changing the flow-rates of both the continuous and\ndispersed phases, as well as the relative importance of viscous forces, surface\ntension forces and thermocapillary stresses. The range of parameters is broad\nenough to characterize the effects of thermocapillarity on different mechanisms\nof break-up in the confined T-junction, including the so-called \"squeezing\" and\n\"dripping\" regimes, previously identified in the literature. Some simple\nscaling arguments are proposed to rationalize the observed behaviour, and to\nprovide quantitative guidelines on how to predict the droplet size after\nbreak-up.\n", "  We study ground states and excitations of light octet and decuplet baryons\nwithin the framework of Dyson-Schwinger and Faddeev equations. We improve upon\nsimilar approaches by explicitly taking into account the momentum-dependent\ndynamics of the quark-gluon interaction that leads to dynamical chiral symmetry\nbreaking. We perform calculations in both the three-body Faddeev framework and\nthe quark-diquark approximation in order to assess the impact of the latter on\nthe spectrum. Our results indicate that both approaches agree well with each\nother. The resulting spectra furthermore agree one-to-one with experiment,\nprovided well-known deficiencies of the rainbow-ladder approximation are\ncompensated for. We also discuss the mass evolution of the Roper and the\nexcited Delta with varying pion mass and analyse the internal structure in\nterms of their partial wave decompositions.\n", "  A study of $B_c^+\\to K^+K^-\\pi^+$ decays is performed for the first time\nusing data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.0 $\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$\ncollected by the LHCb experiment in $pp$ collisions at centre-of-mass energies\nof $7$ and $8$ TeV. Evidence for the decay $B_c^+\\to\\chi_{c0}(\\to K^+K^-)\\pi^+$\nis reported with a significance of 4.0 standard deviations, resulting in the\nmeasurement of\n$\\frac{\\sigma(B_c^+)}{\\sigma(B^+)}\\times\\mathcal{B}(B_c^+\\to\\chi_{c0}\\pi^+)$ to\nbe $(9.8^{+3.4}_{-3.0}(\\mathrm{stat})\\pm 0.8(\\mathrm{syst}))\\times 10^{-6}$.\nHere $\\mathcal{B}$ denotes a branching fraction while $\\sigma(B_c^+)$ and\n$\\sigma(B^+)$ are the production cross-sections for $B_c^+$ and $B^+$ mesons.\nAn indication of $\\bar b c$ weak annihilation is found for the region\n$m(K^-\\pi^+)<1.834\\mathrm{\\,Ge\\kern -0.1em V\\!/}c^2$, with a significance of\n2.4 standard deviations.\n", "  Heterogeneity can be accounted for by a random potential in the wave\nequation. For acoustic waves in a fluid with fluctuations of both density and\ncompressibility (as well as for electromagnetic waves in a medium with\nfluctuation of both permittivity and permeability) the random potential entails\na scalar and an operator contribution. For simplicity, the latter is usually\noverlooked in multiple scattering theory: whatever the type of waves, this\nsimplification amounts to considering the Helmholtz equation with a sound speed\n$c$ depending on position $\\mathbf{r}$. In this work, a radiative transfer\nequation is derived from the wave equation, in order to study energy transport\nthrough a multiple scattering medium. In particular, the influence of the\noperator term on various transport parameters is studied, based on the\ndiagrammatic approach of multiple scattering. Analytical results are obtained\nfor fundamental quantities of transport theory such as the transport mean-free\npath $\\ell^*$, scattering phase function $f$ and anisotropy factor $g$.\nDiscarding the operator term in the wave equation is shown to have a\nsignificant impact on $f$ and $g$, yet limited to the low-frequency regime\ni.e., when the correlation length of the disorder $\\ell_c$ is smaller than or\ncomparable to the wavelength $\\lambda$. More surprisingly, discarding the\noperator part has a significant impact on the transport mean-free path $\\ell^*$\nwhatever the frequency regime. When the scalar and operator terms have\nidentical amplitudes, the discrepancy on the transport mean-free path is around\n$300\\,\\%$ in the low-frequency regime, and still above $30\\,\\%$ for\n$\\ell_c/\\lambda=10^3$ no matter how weak fluctuations of the disorder are.\nAnalytical results are supported by numerical simulations of the wave equation\nand Monte Carlo simulations.\n", "  The problem of a linear damped noisy oscillator is treated in the presence of\ntwo multiplicative sources of noise which imply a random mass and random\ndamping. The additive noise and the noise in the damping are responsible for an\ninflux of energy to the oscillator and its dissipation to the surrounding\nenvironment. A random mass implies that the surrounding molecules not only\ncollide with the oscillator but may also adhere to it, thereby changing its\nmass. We present general formulas for the first two moments and address the\nquestion of mean and energetic stabilities. The phenomenon of stochastic\nresonance, i.e. the expansion due to the noise of a system response to an\nexternal periodic signal, is considered for separate and joint action of two\nsources of noise and their characteristics.\n", "  We present a method to microscopically derive a small-size k$\\cdot$p\nHamiltonian in a Hilbert space spanned by physically chosen ab initio spinor\nwave functions. Without imposing any complementary symmetry constraints, our\nformalism equally treats three- and two-dimensional systems and simultaneously\nyields the Hamiltonian parameters and the true $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological\ninvariant. We consider bulk crystals and thin films of Bi$_{2}$Se$_{3}$,\nBi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$, and Sb$_{2}$Te$_{3}$. It turns out that the effective\ncontinuous k$\\cdot$p models with open boundary conditions often incorrectly\npredict the topological character of thin films.\n", "  Debris disks often take the form of eccentric rings with azimuthal\nasymmetries in surface brightness. Such disks are often described as showing\n\"pericenter glow\", an enhancement of the disk brightness in regions nearest the\ncentral star. At long wavelengths, however, the disk apocenters should appear\nbrighter than their pericenters: in the long wavelength limit, we find the\napocenter/pericenter flux ratio scales as 1+e for disk eccentricity e. We\nproduce new models of this \"apocenter glow\" to explore its causes and\nwavelength dependence and study its potential as a probe of dust grain\nproperties. Based on our models, we argue that several far-infrared and\n(sub)millimeter images of the Fomalhaut and epsilon Eridani debris rings\nobtained with Herschel, JCMT, SHARC II, ALMA, and ATCA should be reinterpreted\nas suggestions or examples of apocenter glow. This reinterpretation yields new\nconstraints on the disks' dust grain properties and size distributions.\n", "  Modeling the stochastic gravitational wave background from various\nastrophysical sources is a key objective in view of upcoming observations with\nground- and space-based gravitational wave observatories such as Advanced LIGO,\nVIRGO, eLISA and PTA. We develop a synthetic model framework that follows the\nevolution of single and binary compact objects in an astrophysical context. We\ndescribe the formation and merger rates of binaries, the evolution of their\norbital parameters with time and the spectrum of emitted gravitational waves at\ndifferent stages of binary evolution. Our approach is modular and allows us to\ntest and constrain different ingredients of the model, including stellar\nevolution, black hole formation scenarios and the properties of binary systems.\nWe use this framework in the context of a particularly well-motivated\nastrophysical setup to calculate the gravitational wave background from several\ntypes of sources, including inspiraling stellar-mass binary black holes that\nhave not merged during a Hubble time. We find that this signal, albeit weak,\nhas a characteristic shape that can help constrain the properties of binary\nblack holes in a way complementary to observations of the background from\nmerger events. We discuss possible applications of our framework in the context\nof other gravitational wave sources, such as supermassive black holes.\n", "  We demonstrate a 12 quantum dot device fabricated on an undoped Si/SiGe\nheterostructure as a proof-of-concept for a scalable, linear gate architecture\nfor semiconductor quantum dots. The device consists of 9 quantum dots in a\nlinear array and 3 single quantum dot charge sensors. We show reproducible\nsingle quantum dot charging and orbital energies, with standard deviations less\nthan 20% relative to the mean across the 9 dot array. The single quantum dot\ncharge sensors have a charge sensitivity of 8.2 x 10^{-4} e/root(Hz) and allow\nthe investigation of real-time charge dynamics. As a demonstration of the\nversatility of this device, we use single-shot readout to measure a spin\nrelaxation time T1 = 170 ms at a magnetic field B = 1 T. By reconfiguring the\ndevice, we form two capacitively coupled double quantum dots and extract a\nmutual charging energy of 200 microeV, which indicates that 50 GHz two-qubit\ngate operation speeds are feasible.\n", "  The various mechanisms of magneto-convective energy transport determines the\nstructure of sunspots and active regions. We characterise the appearance of\nlight bridges and other fine-structure details and elaborate on their\nmagneto-convective nature. We present speckle-reconstructed images taken with\nthe broad-band imager at the 1.5 m GREGOR telescope in the 486nm and 589nm\nbands. We estimate the spatial resolution from the noise characteristics of the\nimage bursts and obtain 0.08\" at 589nm. We describe structure details in\nindividual best images as well as the temporal evolution of selected features.\nWe find branched dark lanes extending along thin (~1\") light bridges in\nsunspots at various heliocentric angles. In thick (~2\") light bridges the\nbranches are disconnected from the central lane and have a Y shape with a\nbright grain toward the umbra. The images reveal that light bridges exist on\nvarying intensity levels and that their small-scale features evolve on\ntimescales of minutes. Faint light bridges show dark lanes outlined by the\nsurrounding bright features. Dark lanes are very common and are also found in\nthe boundary of pores. They have a characteristic width of 0.1\" or smaller.\nIntergranular dark lanes of that width are seen in active region granulation.\nWhile central dark lanes in thin light bridges are elevated and associated with\nan density increase above upflows, the dark lane branches correspond to\nlocations of downflows and are depressed relative to the adjacent bright\nplasma. Thick light bridges with central dark lanes show no projection effect.\nThey have a flat elevated plateau that falls off steeply at the umbral\nboundary. There, Y-shaped filaments form as they do in the inner penumbra. This\nindicates the presence of inclined magnetic fields, meaning that the umbral\nmagnetic field is wrapped around the convective light bridge.\n", "  The dynamical impact of Lyman-alpha (Ly{\\alpha}) radiation pressure on galaxy\nformation depends on the rate and duration of momentum transfer between\nLy{\\alpha} photons and neutral hydrogen gas. Although photon trapping has the\npotential to multiply the effective force, ionizing radiation from stellar\nsources may relieve the Ly{\\alpha} pressure before appreciably affecting the\nkinematics of the host galaxy or efficiently coupling Ly{\\alpha} photons to the\noutflow. We present self-consistent Ly{\\alpha} radiation-hydrodynamics\nsimulations of high-$z$ galaxy environments by coupling the Cosmic Ly{\\alpha}\nTransfer code (COLT) with spherically symmetric Lagrangian frame hydrodynamics.\nThe accurate but computationally expensive Monte-Carlo radiative transfer\ncalculations are feasible under the one-dimensional approximation. The initial\nstarburst drives an expanding shell of gas from the centre and in certain cases\nLy{\\alpha} feedback significantly enhances the shell velocity. Radiative\nfeedback alone is capable of ejecting baryons into the intergalactic medium\n(IGM) for protogalaxies with a virial mass of $M_{\\rm vir} \\lesssim 10^8~{\\rm\nM}_\\odot$. We compare the Ly{\\alpha} signatures of Population III stars with\n$10^5$ K blackbody emission to that of direct collapse black holes with a\nnonthermal Compton-thick spectrum and find substantial differences if the\nLy{\\alpha} spectra are shaped by gas pushed by Ly{\\alpha} radiation-driven\nwinds. For both sources, the flux emerging from the galaxy is reprocessed by\nthe IGM such that the observed Ly{\\alpha} luminosity is reduced significantly\nand the time-averaged velocity offset of the Ly{\\alpha} peak is shifted\nredward.\n", "  Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) is a technique that gives simultaneously\nthe spectrum of each spatial sampling element in a given object field. It is a\npowerful tool which rearranges the data cube (x, y, lambda) represented by two\nspatial dimensions defining the field and the spectral decomposition in a\ndetector plane. In IFS, the spatial unit reorganizes the field and the spectral\nunit is being composed of a classical spectrograph.The development of a\nCollimating Slicer aims at proposing a new type of integral field spectrograph\nwhich should be more compact. The main idea is to combine the image slicer with\nthe collimator of the spectrograph, thus mixing the spatial and spectral units.\nThe traditional combination of slicer, pupil and slit elements and the\nspectrograph collimator is replaced by a new one composed of a slicer and\ncollimator only. In this paper, the state of the art of integral field\nspectroscopy using image slicers is described. The new system based onto the\ndevelopment of a Collimating Slicer for optical integral field spectroscopy is\ndepicted. First system analysis results and future improvements are discussed.\nIt finally turns out that this new system looks very promising for low\nresolution spectroscopy.\n", "  We use 3.6 $\\mu$m photometry from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in\nGalaxies (S$^{4}$G) to trace the stellar distribution in nearby disk galaxies\n($z\\approx0$) with total stellar masses $10^{8.5}\\lesssim\nM_{\\ast}/M_{\\odot}\\lesssim10^{11}$ and mid-IR Hubble types $-3 \\le T \\le 10$,\nand to provide observational constraints for galaxy formation models to be\nchecked against. For 1154 galaxies with disk inclinations lower than\n$65^{\\circ}$, we Fourier decompose and rescale their images to a common frame\ndetermined (i) by the size in physical units, (ii) by their disk scalelength,\nand for 748 barred galaxies (iii) by both the length and orientation of their\nbars. We stack the resized density profiles and images to obtain statistically\nrepresentative average stellar disks and bars in bins of $M_{\\ast}$ and $T$. We\nalso calculate the mean stellar contribution to the circular velocity. We infer\nthe gravitational potentials from the synthetic bars to obtain the\ntangential-to-radial force ratio ($Q_{\\rm T}$) and $A_2$ profiles in the\ndifferent bins. We provide observational evidence for bar-induced secular\nevolution of disk galaxies. For $M_{\\ast} \\ge 10^{9}M_{\\odot}$, we find a\nsignificant difference in the stellar density profiles of barred and non-barred\nsystems: (i) disks in barred galaxies show larger scalelengths ($h_{\\rm R}$)\nand fainter extrapolated central surface brightnesses ($\\Sigma_{0}$), (ii) the\nmean surface brightness profiles ($\\Sigma_{\\ast}$) of barred and non-barred\ngalaxies intersect each other slightly beyond the mean bar length, most likely\nat the bar corotation, and (iii) the central mass concentration of barred\ngalaxies is larger (by almost a factor 2 when $T\\le5$) than in their non-barred\ncounterparts. We also show that bars hosted by early-type galaxies are more\ncentrally concentrated and have larger density amplitudes than their late-type\ncounterparts (Abridged).\n", "  We present the results of the search for decaying dark matter with particle\nmass in the 6-40 keV range with NuSTAR deep observations of COSMOS and ECDFS\nempty sky fields. We show that main contribution to the decaying dark matter\nsignal from the Milky Way galaxy comes through the aperture of the NuSTAR\ndetector, rather than through the focusing optics. High sensitivity of the\nNuSTAR detector, combined with the large aperture and large exposure times of\nthe two observation fields allow us to improve previously existing constraints\non the dark matter decay time by up to an order of magnitude in the mass range\n10-30 keV. In the particular case of the nuMSM sterile neutrino dark matter,\nour constraints impose an upper bound m<20 keV on the dark matter particle\nmass. We report detection of four unidentified spectral lines in our data set.\nThese line detections are either due to the systematic effects (uncertainties\nof calibrations of the NuSTAR detectors) or have an astrophysical origin. We\ndiscuss different possibilities for testing the nature of the detected lines.\n", "  We discuss generation of subwavelength optical barriers on the scale of tens\nof nanometers, as conservative optical potentials for cold atoms. These arise\nfrom non-adiabatic corrections to Born-Oppenheimer potentials from dressed\n`dark states' in atomic $\\Lambda$-configurations. We illustrate the concepts\nwith a double layer potential for atoms obtained from inserting an optical\nsubwavelength barrier into a well generated by an off-resonant optical lattice,\nand discuss bound states of pairs of atoms interacting via magnetic dipolar\ninteractions. The subwavelength optical barriers represent an optical\n`Kronig-Penney' potential. We present a detailed study of the bandstructure in\noptical `Kronig-Penney' potentials, including decoherence from spontaneous\nemission and atom loss to open `bright' channels.\n", "  Galaxies fall into two clearly distinct types: `blue-sequence' galaxies that\nare rapidly forming young stars, and `red-sequence' galaxies in which star\nformation has almost completely ceased. Most galaxies more massive than\n$3\\times10^{10} M_\\odot$ follow the red-sequence while less massive central\ngalaxies lie on the blue sequence. We show that these sequences are created by\na competition between star formation-driven outflows and gas accretion on to\nthe supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center. We develop a simple\nanalytic model for this interaction. In galaxies less massive than\n$3\\times10^{10} M_\\odot$, young stars and supernovae drive a high entropy\noutflow that is more buoyant that any diffuse corona. The outflow balances the\nrate of gas inflow, preventing high gas densities building up in the central\nregions. More massive galaxies, however, are surrounded by a hot corona. We\nargue that above a halo mass of $\\sim 10^{12} M_\\odot$, the supernova-driven\noutflow is no longer buoyant and star formation is unable to prevent the build\nup of gas in the central regions. This triggers a strongly non-linear response\nfrom the black hole. Its accretion rate rises rapidly, heating the galaxy's\ncorona, disrupting the incoming supply of cool gas and starving the galaxy of\nthe fuel for star formation. The host galaxy makes a transition to the red\nsequence, and further growth predominantly occurs through galaxy mergers. We\nshow that the analytic model provides a good description of galaxy evolution in\nthe EAGLE hydrodynamic simulations, and demonstrate that, so long as star\nformation-driven outflows are present, the transition mass scale is almost\nindependent of subgrid parameter choice. The transition mass disappears\nentirely, however, if star formation driven outflows are absent.\n", "  Gravitational-wave tails are due to the backscattering of linear waves onto\nthe space-time curvature generated by the total mass of the matter source. The\ndominant tails correspond to quadratic non-linear interactions and arise at the\none-and-a-half post-Newtonian (1.5PN) order in the gravitational waveform. The\n\"tails-of-tails\", which are cubic non-linear effects appearing at the 3PN order\nin the waveform, are also known. We derive here higher non-linear tail effects,\nnamely those associated with quartic non-linear interactions or\n\"tails-of-tails-of-tails\", which are shown to arise at the 4.5PN order. As an\napplication, we obtain at that order the complete coefficient in the total\ngravitational-wave energy flux of compact binary systems moving on circular\norbits. Our result perfectly agrees with black-hole perturbation calculations\nin the limit of extreme mass ratio of the two compact objects.\n", "  In a graphene {\\em pn} junction at high magnetic field, unidirectional \"snake\nstates\" are formed at the {\\em pn} interface. In a clean {\\em pn} junction,\neach snake state exists in one of the valleys of the graphene band structure,\nand the conductance of the junction as a whole is determined by microscopic\ndetails of the coupling between the snake states at the {\\em pn} interface and\nquantum Hall edge states at the sample boundaries [Tworzydlo {\\em et al.},\nPhys. Rev. B {\\bf 76}, 035411 (2007)]. Disorder mixes and couples the snake\nstates. We here report a calculation of the full conductance distribution in\nthe crossover between the clean limit and the strong disorder limit, in which\nthe conductance distribution is given by random matrix theory [Abanin and\nLevitov, Science {\\bf 317}, 641 (2007)]. Our calculation involves an exact\nsolution of the relevant scaling equation for the scattering matrix, and the\nresults are formulated in terms of parameters describing the microscopic\ndisorder potential in bulk graphene.\n", "  We obtain a family of regular static, spherically symmetric solutions in\nEinstein--Cartan theory with an electromagnetic field and a nonminimally\ncoupled scalar field with the correct sign of kinetic energy density. At\ndifferent values of its parameters, the solution, being asemptotically flat at\nlarge values of the radial coordinate, describes (i) twice asemptotically flat\nsymmetric wormholes, (ii) asymmetric wormholes with an AdS asymptotic at the\n\"far end\", (iii) regular black holes with an extremal horizon or two simple\nhorizons, and (iv) black universes with a de Sitter asymptotic at the \"far\nend\". As in other black universe models, it is a black hole as seen by a\ndistant observer, but beyond its horizon there is a nonsingular expanding\nuniverse. In all these cases, both the metric and the torsion are regular in\nthe whole space.\n", "  It is well known that a state with complex energy cannot be the eigenstate of\na self-adjoint operator, like the Hamiltonian. Resonances, i.e. states with\nexponentially decaying observables, are not vectors belonging to the\nconventional Hilbert space. One can describe these resonances in an unusual\nmathematical formalism, based on the so-called Rigged Hilbert Space (RHS). In\nthe RHS, the states with complex energy are denoted as Gamow Vectors (GV), and\nthey model decay processes. We study GV of the Reversed Harmonic Oscillator\n(RHO), and we analytically and numerically investigate the unstable evolution\nof wave packets. We introduce the background function to study initial data not\ncomposed only by a summation of GV and we analyse different wave packets\nbelonging to specific function spaces. Our work furnishes support to the idea\nthat irreversible wave propagations can be investigated by means of Rigged\nHilbert Space Quantum Mechanics and provides insights for the experimental\ninvestigation of irreversible dynamics.\n", "  In this paper, we study in detail the role of general relativity on the\nglobal dynamics of giant pulsar glitches as exemplified by Vela. For this\npurpose, we carry out numerical simulations of the spin up triggered by the\nsudden unpinning of superfluid vortices. In particular, we compute the exchange\nof angular momentum between the core neutron superfluid and the rest of the\nstar within a two-fluid model including both (non-dissipative) entrainment\neffects and (dissipative) mutual friction forces. Our simulations are based on\na quasi-stationary approach using realistic equations of state (EoSs). We show\nthat the evolution of the angular velocities of both fluids can be accurately\ndescribed by an exponential law. The associated characteristic rise time\n$\\tau_{\\text{r}}$, which can be precisely computed from stationary\nconfigurations only, has a form similar to that obtained in the Newtonian\nlimit. However, general relativity changes the structure of the star and leads\nto additional couplings between the fluids due to frame-dragging effects. As a\nconsequence, general relativity can have a large impact on the actual value of\n$\\tau_{\\text{r}}$: the errors incurred by using Newtonian gravity are thus\nfound to be as large as $\\sim 40 \\%$ for the models considered. Values of the\nrise time are calculated for Vela and compared with current observational\nlimits. Finally, we study the amount of gravitational waves emitted during a\nglitch. Simple expressions are obtained for the corresponding characteristic\namplitudes and frequencies. The detectability of glitches through gravitational\nwave observatories is briefly discussed.\n", "  We present a comprehensive theory of heat engines (HE) based on a\nquantum-mechanical \"working fluid\" (WF) with periodically-modulated energy\nlevels. The theory is valid for any periodicity of driving Hamiltonians that\ncommute with themselves at all times and do not induce coherence in the WF.\nContinuous and stroke cycles arise in opposite limits of this theory, which\nencompasses hitherto unfamiliar cycle forms, dubbed here hybrid cycles. The\ntheory allows us to discover the speed, power and efficiency limits attainable\nby incoherently-operating multilevel HE depending on the cycle form and the\ndynamical regimes.\n", "  Weyl fermions play a major role in quantum field theory but have been quite\nelusive as fundamental particles. Materials based on quasi two-dimensional\nbismuth layers were recently designed and provide an arena for the study of the\ninterplay between anisotropic Dirac fermions, magnetism and structural changes,\nallowing the formation of Weyl fermions in condensed matter. Here, we perform\nan optical investigation of YbMnBi$_2$, a representative type II Weyl\nsemimetal, and contrast its excitation spectrum with the optical response of\nthe more conventional semimetal EuMnBi$_2$. Our comparative study allows us\ndisentangling the optical fingerprints of type II Weyl fermions, but also\nchallenge the present theoretical understanding of their electrodynamic\nresponse.\n", "  We investigate how baryogenesis can occur by the presence of an\n$f(T)$-related gravitational term. We study various cases of $f(T)$ gravity and\nwe discuss in detail the effect of the novel terms on the baryon-to-entropy\nratio. Additionally, we study the constraints imposed by the observational\nvalues of the baryon-to-entropy ratio and we discuss how more generalized\ncosmologies can contribute successfully, in a viable and consistent way, in the\ngravitational baryogenesis mechanism.\n", "  Gapless many-body quantum systems in one spatial dimension are universally\ndescribed by the Luttinger liquid effective theory at low energies.\nEssentially, only two parameters enter the effective low-energy description,\nnamely the speed of sound and the Luttinger parameter. These are highly system\ndependent and their calculation requires accurate non-perturbative solutions of\nthe many-body problem. Here, we present a simple method that only uses\ncollisional information to extract the low-energy properties of these systems.\nOur results are in remarkable agreement with available results for integrable\nmodels and from large scale Monte Carlo simulations of one-dimensional helium\nand hydrogen isotopes. Moreover, we estimate theoretically the critical point\nfor spinodal decomposition in one-dimensional helium-4, and show that the\nexponent governing the divergence of the Luttinger parameter near the critical\npoint is exactly 1/2, in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.\n", "  The MaNGA Survey (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory) is one\nof three core programs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV. It is obtaining\nintegral field spectroscopy (IFS) for 10K nearby galaxies at a spectral\nresolution of R~2000 from 3,622-10,354A. The design of the survey is driven by\na set of science requirements on the precision of estimates of the following\nproperties: star formation rate surface density, gas metallicity, stellar\npopulation age, metallicity, and abundance ratio, and their gradients; stellar\nand gas kinematics; and enclosed gravitational mass as a function of radius. We\ndescribe how these science requirements set the depth of the observations and\ndictate sample selection. The majority of targeted galaxies are selected to\nensure uniform spatial coverage in units of effective radius (Re) while\nmaximizing spatial resolution. About 2/3 of the sample is covered out to 1.5Re\n(Primary sample), and 1/3 of the sample is covered to 2.5Re (Secondary sample).\nWe describe the survey execution with details that would be useful in the\ndesign of similar future surveys. We also present statistics on the achieved\ndata quality, specifically, the point spread function, sampling uniformity,\nspectral resolution, sky subtraction, and flux calibration. For our Primary\nsample, the median r-band signal-to-noise ratio is ~73 per 1.4A pixel for\nspectra stacked between 1-1.5 Re. Measurements of various galaxy properties\nfrom the first year data show that we are meeting or exceeding the defined\nrequirements for the majority of our science goals.\n", "  Classification of jets as originating from light-flavor or heavy-flavor\nquarks is an important task for inferring the nature of particles produced in\nhigh-energy collisions. The large and variable dimensionality of the data\nprovided by the tracking detectors makes this task difficult. The current\nstate-of-the-art tools require expert data-reduction to convert the data into a\nfixed low-dimensional form that can be effectively managed by shallow\nclassifiers. We study the application of deep networks to this task, attempting\nclassification at several levels of data, starting from a raw list of tracks.\nWe find that the highest-level lowest-dimensionality expert information\nsacrifices information needed for classification, that the performance of\ncurrent state-of-the-art taggers can be matched or slightly exceeded by\ndeep-network-based taggers using only track and vertex information, that\nclassification using only lowest-level highest-dimensionality tracking\ninformation remains a difficult task for deep networks, and that adding\nlower-level track and vertex information to the classifiers provides a\nsignificant boost in performance compared to the state-of-the-art.\n", "  Recently, differences in Doppler shifts across the base of four close\nclassical T Tauri star jets have been detected with the HST in optical and\nnear-ultraviolet (NUV) emission lines, and these Doppler shifts were\ninterpreted as rotation signatures under the assumption of steady state flow.\nTo support this interpretation, it is necessary that the underlying disks\nrotate in the same sense. Agreement between disk rotation and jet rotation\ndetermined from optical lines has been verified in two cases and rejected in\none case. Meanwhile, the NUV lines, which may trace faster and more collimated\ninner spines of the jet than optical lines, either agree or show no clear\nindication. We propose to perform this test on the fourth system, Th 28. We\npresent ALMA high angular resolution Band 7 continuum, 12CO(3-2) and 13CO(2-1)\nobservations of the circumstellar disk around the T Tauri star Th 28. We were\nable to detect, in CO and continuum, clear signatures of a disk in Keplerian\nrotation around Th28. The 12CO emission is resolved, allowing us to derive\nestimates of disk position angle and inclination. The large velocity separation\nof the peaks in 12CO, combined with the resolved extent of the emission,\nindicate a central stellar mass in the range 1-2 Msun. The rotation sense of\nthe disk is well detected in both 13CO and 12CO emission lines, and this\ndirection is opposite to that implied by the transverse Doppler shifts measured\nin the optical lines of the jet. The Th 28 system is the second system where\ncounter-rotation between the disk and the optical jet is detected. These\nfindings imply either that optical transverse velocity gradients detected with\nHST do not trace jet rotation or that modeling the flow with the steady\nassumption is not valid. In both cases jet rotation studies that rely solely on\noptical lines are not suitable to derive the launching radius of the jet.\n", "  Weak localization was observed and determined in a black phosphorus (bP)\nfield-effect transistor 65 nm thick. The weak localization behaviour was found\nto be in excellent agreement with the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka model for fields up\nto 1~T, from which characteristic scattering lengths could be inferred. The\ndephasing length $L_\\phi$ was found to increase linearly with increasing hole\ndensity attaining a maximum value of 55 nm at a hole density of approximately\n$10^{13} cm^{-2}$ inferred from the Hall effect. The temperature dependence of\n$L_\\phi$ was also investigated and above 1~K, it was found to decrease weaker\nthan the $L_\\phi \\propto T^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ dependence characteristic of\nelectron-electron scattering in the presence of elastic scattering in two\ndimensions. Rather, the observed power law was found to be close to that\nobserved previously in other quasi-one-dimensional systems such as metallic\nnanowires and carbon nanotubes. We attribute our result to the crystal\nstructure of bP which host a `puckered' honeycomb lattice forming a strongly\nanisotropic medium\n", "  CARMENES (Calar Alto high-Resolution search for M dwarfs with Exoearths with\nNear-infrared and optical Echelle Spectrographs) started a new planet survey on\nM-dwarfs in January this year. The new high-resolution spectrographs are\noperating in the visible and near-infrared at Calar Alto Observatory. They will\nperform high-accuracy radial-velocity measurements (goal 1 m s-1) of about 300\nM-dwarfs with the aim to detect low-mass planets within habitable zones. We\ncharacterised the candidate sample for CARMENES and provide fundamental\nparameters for these stars in order to constrain planetary properties and\nunderstand star-planet systems. Using state-of-the-art model atmospheres\n(PHOENIX-ACES) and chi2-minimization with a downhill-simplex method we\ndetermine effective temperature, surface gravity and metallicity [Fe/H] for\nhigh-resolution spectra of around 480 stars of spectral types M0.0-6.5V taken\nwith FEROS, CAFE and HRS. We find good agreement between the models and our\nobserved high-resolution spectra. We show the performance of the algorithm, as\nwell as results, parameter and spectral type distributions for the CARMENES\ncandidate sample, which is used to define the CARMENES target sample. We also\npresent first preliminary results obtained from CARMENES spectra.\n", "  A tendency to form benzene-like molecular orbitals has been recently shown to\nbe a common feature of the $4d$ and $5d$ transition metal oxides with a\nhoneycomb lattice. This tendency competes with other interactions such as the\nspin-orbit coupling and Hubbard correlations, and can be partially or\ncompletely suppressed. In the calculations, SrRu$_{2}$O$_{6}$ presents the\ncleanest, so far, case of well-formed molecular orbitals, however, direct\nexperimental evidence for or against this proposition has been missing. In this\npaper, we show that combined photoemission and optical studies can be used to\nidentify molecular orbitals in SrRu$_{2}$O$_{6}$. Symmetry-driven election\nselection rules suppress optical transitions between certain molecular\norbitals, while photoemission and inverse photoemission measurements are\ninsensitive to them. Comparing the photoemission and optical conductivity\nspectra one should be able to observe clear signatures of molecular orbitals.\n", "  NGC6231 is a massive young star cluster, near the center of the Sco OB1\nassociation. While its OB members are well studied, its low-mass population has\nreceived little attention. We present high-spatial resolution Chandra ACIS-I\nX-ray data, where we detect 1613 point X-ray sources. Our main aim is to\nclarify global properties of NGC6231 down to low masses through a detailed\nmembership assessment, and to study the cluster stars' spatial distribution,\nthe origin of their X-ray emission, the cluster age and formation history, and\ninitial mass function. We use X-ray data, complemented by optical/IR data, to\nestablish cluster membership. The spatial distribution of different stellar\nsubgroups also provides highly significant constraints on cluster membership,\nas does the distribution of X-ray hardness. We perform spectral modeling of\ngroup-stacked X-ray source spectra. We find a large cluster population down to\n~0.3 Msun (complete to ~1 Msun), with minimal non-member contamination, with a\ndefinite age spread (1-8 Myrs) for the low-mass PMS stars. We argue that\nlow-mass cluster stars also constitute the majority of the few hundreds\nunidentified X-ray sources. We find mass segregation for the most massive\nstars. The fraction of circumstellar-disk bearing members is found to be ~5%.\nPhotoevaporation of disks under the action of massive stars is suggested by the\nspatial distribution of the IR-excess stars. We also find strong Halpha\nemission in 9% of cluster PMS stars. The dependence of X-ray properties on\nmass, stellar structure, and age agrees with extrapolations based on other\nyoung clusters. The cluster initial mass function, computed over ~2 dex in\nmass, has a slope Gamma~-1.14. The total mass of cluster members above 1 Msun\nis 2280 Msun, and the inferred total mass is 4380 Msun. We also study the\npeculiar, hard X-ray spectrum of the Wolf-Rayet star WR79.\n", "  Certain scalar-tensor theories of gravity that generalize\nJordan-Fierz-Brans-Dicke theory are known to predict non-trivial phenomenology\nfor neutron stars. In these theories, first proposed by Damour and\nEsposito-Far\\`ese, the scalar field has a standard kinetic term, and couples\nconformally to the matter fields. The weak equivalence principle is therefore\nsatisfied, but scalar effects may arise in strong-field regimes, e.g. allowing\nfor violations of the strong equivalence principle in neutron stars\n(\"spontaneous scalarization\") or in sufficiently tight binary neutron-star\nsystems (\"dynamical/induced scalarization\"). The original scalar-tensor theory\nproposed by Damour and Esposito-Far\\`ese is in tension with solar-system\nconstraints (for couplings that lead to scalarization), if one accounts for\ncosmological evolution of the scalar field and no mass term is included in the\naction. We here extend the conformal coupling of that theory, in order to\nascertain if, in this way, solar-system tests can be passed, while retaining a\nnon-trivial phenomenology for neutron stars. We find that even with this\ngeneralized conformal coupling, it is impossible to construct a theory that\npasses both Big-Bang nucleosynthesis and solar-system constraints, while\nsimultaneously allowing for scalarization in isolated/binary neutron stars.\n", "  We present mass models of the Milky Way created to fit observational\nconstraints and to be consistent with expectations from theoretical modelling.\nThe method used to create these models is that demonstrated in McMillan (2011),\nand we improve on those models by adding gas discs to the potential,\nconsidering the effects of allowing the inner slope of the halo density profile\nto vary, and including new observations of maser sources in the Milky Way\namongst the new constraints. We provide a best fitting model, as well as\nestimates of the properties of the Milky Way. Under the assumptions in our main\nmodel, we find that the Sun is $R_0 = (8.20\\pm0.09)\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$ from the\nGalactic Centre, with the circular speed at the Sun being $v_0 =\n(232.8\\pm3.0)\\,\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$; that the Galaxy has a total\nstellar mass of $(54.3\\pm5.7)\\times10^9\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$, a total virial mass of\n$(1.30 \\pm 0.30)\\times10^{12}\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$ and a local dark-matter density\nof $0.38\\pm0.04\\,\\mathrm{GeV\\,cm}^{-3}$, where the quoted uncertainties are\nstatistical. These values are sensitive to our choice of priors and\nconstraints. We investigate systematic uncertainties, which in some cases may\nbe larger. For example, if we weaken our prior on $R_0$, we find it to be\n$(7.97\\pm0.15)\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$ and that\n$v_0=(226.8\\pm4.2)\\,\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We find that most of these\nproperties, including the local dark-matter density, are remarkably insensitive\nto the assumed power-law density slope at the centre of the dark-matter halo.\nWe find that it is unlikely that the local standard of rest differs\nsignificantly from that found under assumptions of axisymmetry. We have made\ncode to compute the force from our potential, and to integrate orbits within\nit, publicly available.\n", "  The Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) is a wide-field, multi-object spectrograph\naccommodating 2394 fibers to observe the sky at the prime focus of the Subaru\ntelescope. The software system to operate a spectroscopic survey is structured\nby the four packages: Instrument control software, exposure targeting software,\ndata reduction pipeline, and survey planning and tracking software. In\naddition, we operate a database system where various information such as\nproperties of target objects, instrument configurations, and observation\nconditions is stored and is organized via a standardized data model for future\nreferences to update survey plans and to scientific researches. In this\narticle, we present an overview of the software system and describe the\nworkflows that need to be performed in the PFS operation, with some highlights\non the database that organizes various information from sub-processes in the\nsurvey operation, and on the process of fiber configuration from the software\nperspectives.\n", "  We report the discovery of K2-98 b (EPIC 211391664 b), a transiting\nNeptune-sized planet monitored by the K2 mission during its campaign 5. We\ncombine the K2 time-series data with ground-based photometric and spectroscopic\nfollow-up observations to confirm the planetary nature of the object and derive\nits mass, radius, and orbital parameters. K2-98 b is a warm Neptune-like planet\nin a 10-day orbit around a V=12.2~mag F-type star with $M_\\star$=$\n1.074\\pm0.042$, $R_\\star$=$ 1.311 ^{+ 0.083} _{ - 0.048} $, and age of\n$5.2_{-1.0}^{+1.2}$~Gyr. We derive a planetary mass and radius of\n$M_\\mathrm{p}$=$ 32.2 \\pm 8.1 $ and $R_\\mathrm{p}$=$4.3^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$. K2-98 b\njoins the relatively small group of Neptune-sized planets whose both mass and\nradius have been derived with a precision better than 25 %. We estimate that\nthe planet will be engulfed by its host star in $\\sim$3~Gyr, due to the\nevolution of the latter towards the red giant branch.\n", "  We consider a class of models involving interactions between ultra-light\nscalar dark matter and Standard Model neutrinos. Such couplings modify the\nneutrino mass splittings and mixing angles to include additional components\nthat vary in time periodically with a frequency and amplitude set by the mass\nand energy density of the dark matter. Null results from recent searches for\nanomalous periodicities in the solar neutrino flux strongly constrain the dark\nmatter-neutrino coupling to be orders of magnitude below current and projected\nlimits derived from observations of the cosmic microwave background.\n", "  Precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectrum\nare in excellent agreement with the predictions of the standard $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmological model. However, there is some tension between the value of the\nHubble parameter $H_0$ inferred from the CMB and that inferred from\nobservations of the Universe at lower redshifts, and the unusually small value\nof the dark-energy density is a puzzling ingredient of the model. In this\npaper, we explore a scenario with a new exotic energy density that behaves like\na cosmological constant at early times and then decays quickly at some critical\nredshift $z_c$. An exotic energy density like this is motivated by some\nstring-axiverse-inspired scenarios for dark energy. By increasing the expansion\nrate at early times, the very precisely determined angular scale of the sound\nhorizon at decoupling can be preserved with a larger Hubble constant. We find,\nhowever, that the Planck temperature power spectrum tightly constrains the\nmagnitude of the early dark-energy density and thus any shift in the Hubble\nconstant obtained from the CMB. If the reionization optical depth is required\nto be smaller than the Planck 2016 $2\\sigma$ upper bound $\\tau\\lesssim 0.0774$,\nthen early dark energy allows a Hubble-parameter shift of at most 1.6\nkm~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$ (at $z_c\\simeq 1585$), too small to fully alleviate the\nHubble-parameter tension. Only if $\\tau$ is increased by more than $5\\sigma$\ncan the CMB Hubble parameter be brought into agreement with that from local\nmeasurements. In the process, we derive strong constraints to the contribution\nof early dark energy at the time of recombination---it can never exceed\n$\\sim2\\%$ of the radiation/matter density for $10 \\lesssim z_c \\lesssim 10^5$.\n", "  The most precise top quark mass measurements use kinematic reconstruction\nmethods, determining the top mass parameter of a Monte Carlo event generator,\n$m_t^{\\rm MC}$. Due to hadronization and parton shower dynamics, relating\n$m_t^{\\rm MC}$ to a field theory mass is difficult. We present a calibration\nprocedure to determine this relation using hadron level QCD predictions for\nobservables with kinematic mass sensitivity. Fitting $e^+e^-$ 2-Jettiness\ncalculations at NLL/NNLL order to Pythia 8.205, $m_t^{\\rm MC}$ differs from the\npole mass by $900$/$600$ MeV, and agrees with the MSR mass within\nuncertainties, $m_t^{\\rm MC}\\simeq m_{t,1\\,{\\rm GeV}}^{\\rm MSR}$.\n", "  Gamma Cassiopeiae is an enigmatic Be star with unusually strong hard X-ray\nemission. The Suzaku observatory detected six rapid X-ray spectral hardening\nevents called \"softness dips\" in a ~100 ksec duration observation in 2011. All\nthe softness dip events show symmetric softness ratio variations, and some of\nthem have flat bottoms apparently due to saturation. The softness dip spectra\nare best described by either ~40% or ~70% partial covering absorption to kT ~12\nkeV plasma emission by matter with a neutral hydrogen column density of ~2-8e21\ncm-2, while the spectrum outside of these dips is almost free of absorption.\nThis result suggests the presence of two distinct X-ray emitting spots in the\ngamma Cas system, perhaps on a white dwarf companion with dipole mass\naccretion. The partial covering absorbers may be blobs in the Be stellar wind,\nthe Be disk, or rotating around the white dwarf companion. Weak correlations of\nthe softness ratios to the hard X-ray flux suggest the presence of stable\nplasmas at kT ~0.9 and 5 keV, which may originate from the Be or white dwarf\nwinds. The formation of a Be star and white dwarf binary system requires mass\ntransfer between two stars; gamma Cas may have experienced such activity in the\npast.\n", "  We calculate the renormalized parameters for the quasiparticles and their\ninteractions for the Hubbard model in the paramagnetic phase as deduced from\nthe low energy Fermi liquid fixed point using the results of a numerical\nrenormalization group calculation (NRG) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT).\nEven in the low density limit there is significant renormalization of the local\nquasiparticle interaction $\\tilde U$, in agreement with estimates based on the\ntwo-particle scattering theory of Kanamori (1963). On the approach to the Mott\ntransition we find a finite ratio for $\\tilde U/\\tilde D$, where $2\\tilde D$ is\nthe renormalized bandwidth, which is independent of whether the transition is\napproached by increasing the on-site interaction $U$ or on increasing the\ndensity to half-filling.The leading $\\omega^2$ term in the self-energy and the\nlocal dynamical spin and charge susceptibilities are calculated within the\nrenormalized perturbation theory (RPT) and compared with the results calculated\ndirectly from the NRG-DMFT. The dynamic ${\\bf q},\\omega$ spin susceptibility\n$\\chi({\\bf q},\\omega)$ is also estimated from repeated quasiparticle scattering\nwith a local renormalized scattering vertex.\n", "  We study analytically the superfluid flow of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a\nring geometry in presence of a rotating barrier. We show that a phase\ntransition breaking a parity symmetry among two topological phases occurs at a\ncritical value of the height of the barrier. Furthermore, a discontinuous\n(accompanied by hysteresis) phase transition is observed in the ordered phase\nwhen changing the angular velocity of the barrier. At the critical point where\nthe hysteresis area vanishes, chemical potential of the ground state develops a\ncusp (a discontinuity in the first derivative). Along this path, the jump\nbetween the two corresponding states having a different winding number shows\nstrict analogies with a topological phase transition. We finally study the\ncurrent-phase relation of the system and compare some of our calculations with\npublished experimental results.\n", "  In these lectures we review two procedures for constructing finite difference\nnumerical schemes that preserve symmetries of differential equations. The first\napproach is based on Lie's infinitesimal symmetry generators, while the second\nmethod uses the novel theory of equivariant moving frames. The advantages of\nboth techniques are discussed and illustrated with the Schwarzian differential\nequation, the Korteweg-de Vries equation and Burgers' equation. Numerical\nsimulations are presented and innovative techniques for obtaining better\ninvariant numerical schemes are introduced. New research directions and open\nproblems are indicated at the end of these notes.\n", "  This paper describes how the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) is extending open\nsource software components to develop new services. In August 2015, KOA\ndeployed a program interface to discover public data from all instruments\nequipped with an imaging mode. The interface complies with version 2 of the\nSimple Imaging Access Protocol (SIAP), under development by the International\nVirtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA), which defines a standard mechanism for\ndiscovering images through spatial queries. The heart of the KOA service is an\nR-tree-based, database-indexing mechanism prototyped by the Virtual\nAstronomical Observatory (VAO) and further developed by the Montage Image\nMosaic project, designed to provide fast access to large imaging data sets as a\nfirst step in creating wide-area image mosaics. The KOA service uses the\nresults of the spatial R-tree search to create an SQLite data database for\nfurther relational filtering. The service uses a JSON configuration file to\ndescribe the association between instrument parameters and the service query\nparameters, and to make it applicable beyond the Keck instruments.\n  The R-tree program was itself extended to support temporal (in addition to\nspatial) indexing, in response to requests from the planetary science community\nfor a search engine to discover observations of Solar System objects. With this\n3D-indexing scheme, the service performs very fast time and spatial matches\nbetween the target ephemerides, obtained from the JPL SPICE service. Our\nexperiments indicate these matches can be more than 100 times faster than when\nseparating temporal and spatial searches. Images of the tracks of the moving\ntargets, overlaid with the image footprints, are computed with a new\ncommand-line visualization tool, mViewer, released with the Montage\ndistribution. The service is currently in test and will be released in Fall\n2016.\n", "  The Australian Astronomical Observatory's TAIPAN instrument deploys 150\nStarbug robots to position optical fibres to accuracies of 0.3 arcsec, on a 32\ncm glass field plate on the focal plane of the 1.2 m UK-Schmidt telescope. This\npaper describes the software system developed to control and monitor the\nStarbugs, with particular emphasis on the automated path-finding algorithms,\nand the metrology software which keeps track of the position and motion of\nindividual Starbugs as they independently move in a crowded field. The software\nemploys a tiered approach to find a collision-free path for every Starbug, from\nits current position to its target location. This consists of three\npath-finding stages of increasing complexity and computational cost. For each\nStarbug a path is attempted using a simple method. If unsuccessful,\nsubsequently more complex (and expensive) methods are tried until a valid path\nis found or the target is flagged as unreachable.\n", "  We study the impurity problem in a gas of $^{173}$Yb atoms near the recently\ndiscovered orbital Feshbach resonance. In an orbital Feshbach resonance, atoms\nin the electronic ground state $^1S_0$ interact with those in the long-lived\nexcited $^3P_0$ state with magnetically tunable interactions. We consider an\nimpurity atom with a given hyperfine spin in the $^3P_0$ state interacting with\na single-component Fermi sea of atoms in the ground $^1S_0$ manifold. Close to\nthe orbital Feshbach resonance, the impurity can induce collective\nparticle-hole excitations out of the Fermi sea, which can be regarded as the\npolaron state. While as tuning toward the BEC regime of the resonance, a\nmolecular state becomes the ground state of the system. We show that a polaron\nto molecule transition exists in $^{173}$Yb atoms close to the orbital Feshbach\nresonance. Furthermore, due to the spin-exchange nature of the orbital Feshbach\nresonance, the formation of both the polaron and the molecule involve\nspin-flipping processes with interesting density distributions among the\nrelevant hyperfine spin states. We show that the polaron to molecule transition\ncan be detected using Raman spectroscopy.\n", "  The redistribution of angular momentum is a long standing problem in our\nunderstanding of protoplanetary disk (PPD) evolution. The magnetorotational\ninstability (MRI) is considered a likely mechanism. We present the results of a\nstudy involving multifluid global simulations including Ohmic dissipation,\nambipolar diffusion and the Hall effect in a dynamic, self-consistent way. We\nfocus on the turbulence resulting from the non-linear development of the MRI in\nradially stratified PPDs and compare with ideal MHD simulations.\n  In the multifluid simulations the disk is initially set up to transition from\na weak Hall dominated regime, where the Hall effect is the dominant non-ideal\neffect but approximately the same as or weaker than the inductive term, to a\nstrong Hall dominated regime, where the Hall effect dominates the inductive\nterm. As the simulations progress a substantial portion of the disk develops\ninto a weak Hall dominated disk. We find a transition from turbulent to laminar\nflow in the inner regions of the disk, but without any corresponding overall\ndensity feature.\n  We introduce a dimensionless parameter, $\\alpha_\\mathrm{RM}$, to characterise\naccretion with $\\alpha_\\mathrm{RM} \\gtrsim 0.1$ corresponding to turbulent\ntransport. We calculate the eddy turnover time, $t_\\mathrm{eddy}$, and compared\nthis with an effective recombination timescale, $t_\\mathrm{rcb}$, to determine\nwhether the presence of turbulence necessitates non-equilibrium ionisation\ncalculations. We find that $t_\\mathrm{rcb}$ is typically around three orders of\nmagnitude smaller than $t_\\mathrm{eddy}$. Also, the ionisation fraction does\nnot vary appreciably. These two results suggest that these multifluid\nsimulations should be comparable to single fluid non-ideal simulations.\n", "  A number of experiments on the hyperkagome iridate, Na$_4$Ir$_3$O$_8$,\nsuggest existence of a gapless quantum spin liquid state at low temperature.\nCircumventing the slave particle approach commonly used in theoretical analyses\nof frustrated magnets, we provide a more intuitive, albeit more\nphenomenological, construction of a quantum spin liquid state for the\nhyperkagome Heisenberg model. An effective monomer-dimer model on the\nhyperkagome lattice is proposed a la Hao and Tchernyshyov's approach cultivated\nfrom the Husimi cactus model. Employing an arrow representation for the\nmonomer-dimer model, we obtain a compact $U(1)$ gauge theory with a finite\ndensity of Fermionic spinons on the hyperoctagon lattice. The resulting theory\nand its mean field treatments lead to remarkable agreement with previous\nslave-particle construction of a quantum spin liquid state on the hyperkagome\nlattice. Our results offer novel insights on theoretical understanding of the\nemergence of spinon Fermi surfaces and useful predictions for future\nexperiments.\n", "  When a planet passes in front of a starspot during a transit of its host\nstar, it causes a small upward blip in the light curve. Modelling the transit\nwith the starspot allows the size, brightness and position of the spot to be\nmeasured. If the same spot can be observed in two different transits, it is\npossible to track the motion of the spot due to the rotation of the star. The\nrotation period and velocity of the star (Prot and Vsini) and the sky-projected\norbital obliquity of the system (lambda) can then be determined. If one has\nthree or more observations of the same spot, the true orbital obliquity (psi)\ncan be measured. We are performing this analysis for a number of cool stars\norbited by transiting planets. We present our results so far and compile a\ncatalogue of lambda and psi measurements from spot crossing events. The method\nis particularly useful for cool stars, and is therefore complementary to\nstudies of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, which perform better on hotter and\nfaster-rotating stars.\n", "  We derived a dispersion relation of a surface wave at a rough metal-air\ninterface. In contrast to previous publications, we assumed that an intrinsic\nsurface impedance due to a finite electric conductivity of the metal can be of\nthe same order as the roughness-induced impedance. We then applied our results\nto the analysis of a long-standing problem of the discrepancy between the\nexperimental data on the propagation of surface waves in the terahertz range of\nfrequencies and the classical Drude theory.\n", "  We consider the 2+1 dimensional massive Thirring model with one flavor at\nfinite density. Two numerical methods, fermion bag approach and complex\nLangevin dynamics, are used to calculate the chiral condensate and fermion\ndensity of this model. The numerical results obtained by fermion bag approach\nare compared with those obtained by complex Langevin dynamics. They are also\ncompared with those obtained under phase quenched approximation. We show that\nin some range of fermion coupling strength and chemical potential the sign\nproblem in fermion bag approach is mild, while it becomes severe for the\ncomplex Langevin dynamics.\n", "  The complex electronic properties of $\\mathrm{ZrTe_5}$ have recently\nstimulated in-depth investigations that assigned this material to either a\ntopological insulator or a 3D Dirac semimetal phase. Here we report a\ncomprehensive experimental and theoretical study of both electronic and\nstructural properties of $\\mathrm{ZrTe_5}$, revealing that the bulk material is\na strong topological insulator (STI). By means of angle-resolved photoelectron\nspectroscopy, we identify at the top of the valence band both a surface and a\nbulk state. The dispersion of these bands is well captured by ab initio\ncalculations for the STI case, for the specific interlayer distance measured in\nour x-ray diffraction study. Furthermore, these findings are supported by\nscanning tunneling spectroscopy revealing the metallic character of the sample\nsurface, thus confirming the strong topological nature of $\\mathrm{ZrTe_5}$.\n", "  In polar semiconductors and oxides, the long-range nature of the\nelectron-phonon (\\textit{e}-ph) interaction is a bottleneck to compute charge\ntransport from first principles. Here, we develop an efficient ab initio scheme\nto compute and converge the \\textit{e}-ph relaxation times (RTs) and electron\nmobility in polar materials. We apply our approach to GaAs, where using the\nBoltzmann equation with state-dependent RTs, we compute mobilities in excellent\nagreement with experiment at 250$-$500~K. The $e$-ph RTs and the phonon\ncontributions to intravalley and intervalley $e$-ph scattering are also\nanalyzed. Our work enables efficient ab initio computations of transport and\ncarrier dynamics in polar materials.\n", "  Near Earth Objects (NEOs) are small Solar System bodies whose orbits bring\nthem close to the Earth's orbit. We are carrying out a Warm Spitzer Cycle 11\nExploration Science program entitled NEOSurvey --- a fast and efficient\nflux-limited survey of 597 known NEOs in which we derive diameter and albedo\nfor each target. The vast majority of our targets are too faint to be observed\nby NEOWISE, though a small sample has been or will be observed by both\nobservatories, which allows for a cross-check of our mutual results. Our\nprimary goal is to create a large and uniform catalog of NEO properties. We\npresent here the first results from this new program: fluxes and derived\ndiameters and albedos for 80 NEOs, together with a description of the overall\nprogram and approach, including several updates to our thermal model. The\nlargest source of error in our diameter and albedo solutions, which derive from\nour single band thermal emission measurements, is uncertainty in eta, the\nbeaming parameter used in our thermal modeling; for albedos, improvements in\nSolar System absolute magnitudes would also help significantly. All data and\nderived diameters and albedos from this entire program are being posted on a\npublicly accessible webpage at nearearthobjects.nau.edu .\n", "  Broad emission lines of active galactic nuclei stem from a spatially extended\nregion (broad-line region, BLR) that is composed of discrete clouds and\nphotoionized by the central ionizing continuum. The temporal behaviors of these\nemission lines are blurred echoes of the continuum variations (i.e.,\nreverberation mapping, RM) and directly reflect the structures and kinematic\ninformation of BLRs through the so-called transfer function (also known as the\nvelocity-delay map). Based on the previous works of Rybicki & Press (1992) and\nZu et al. (2011), we develop an extended, non-parametric approach to determine\nthe transfer function for RM data, in which the transfer function is expressed\nas a sum of a family of relatively displaced Gaussian response functions.\nTherefore, arbitrary shapes of transfer functions associated with complicated\nBLR geometry can be seamlessly included, enabling us to relax the presumption\nof a specified transfer function frequently adopted in previous studies and to\nlet it be determined by observation data. We formulate our approach in a\npreviously well-established framework that incorporates the statistical\nmodeling of the continuum variations as a damped random walk process and takes\ninto account the long-term secular variations which are irrelevant to RM\nsignals. The Application to RM data shows the fidelity of our approach.\n", "  Stimulated by the recent observation of the $D_2^\\ast(3000)$, we study the\ndecay behaviors of the $3P$ and $2F$ charmed mesons in the present work. By\ncomparing the masses and decay properties of the $3^3P_2$ and $2^3F_2$ charmed\nmesons with the observation of the $D_2^\\ast(3000)$, we conclude that the most\npossible assignment of the $D_2^\\ast(3000)$ is the $3^3P_2$ charmed meson,\nwhile the assignment of the $2^3F_2$ charmed meson could not be fully exclude.\nThe results of the unobserved $3P$ and $2F$ charmed mesons in this work could\nprovide some fundamental information of searching for these charmed mesons in\nthe further experiments by LHCb and forthcoming Belle II.\n", "  The failure to find evidence for elementary particles that could serve as the\nconstituents of dark matter brings to mind suggestions that dark matter might\nconsist of massive compact objects (MACHOs). In particular, it has recently\nbeen argued that MACHOs with masses > 15 solar masses may have been\nprolifically produced at the onset of the big bang. Although a variety of\nastrophysical signatures for primordial MACHOs with masses in this range have\nbeen discussed in the literature, we favor a strategy that uses the potential\nfor gravitational microlensing of stars outside our galaxy to directly detect\nthe presence of MACHOs in the halo of our galaxy. We point out that the effect\nof the motion of the Earth on the shape of the microlensing brightening curves\nprovides a promising approach to confirming over the course of next several\nyears that dark matter consists of MACHOs.\n", "  Tidal tails are created in major mergers involving disk galaxies. How the\ntidal tails trace the assembly history of massive galaxies remains to be\nexplored. We identify a sample of 461 merging galaxies with long tidal tails\nfrom 35076 galaxies mass-complete at $M_\\star\\ge 10^{9.5}\\,M_{\\odot}$ and\n$0.2\\leq z\\leq1$ based on HST/ACS F814W imaging data and public catalogs of the\nCOSMOS field. The long tails refer to these with length equal to or longer than\nthe diameter of their host galaxies. The mergers with tidal tails are selected\nusing our novel $A_{\\rm O}-D_{\\rm O}$ technique for strong asymmetric features\ntogether with visual examination. Our results show that the fraction of\ntidal-tailed mergers evolves mildly with redshift, as $\\sim (1+z)^{2.0\\pm0.4}$,\nand becomes relatively higher in less massive galaxies out to $z=1$. With a\ntimescale of 0.5 Gyr for the tidal-tailed mergers, we obtain that the\noccurrence rate of such mergers follows $0.01\\pm 0.007\\,(1+z)^{2.3\\pm 1.4}$\nGyr$^{-1}$ and corresponds to $\\sim0.3$ events since $z=1$ and roughly\none-third of the total budget of major mergers from the literature. For\ndisk-involved major mergers, nearly half of them have undergone a phase with\nlong tidal tails\n", "  A density-matrix formalism within the length gauge is developed for the\npurpose of calculating the nonlinear response of intrinsic bilayer graphene at\nterahertz frequencies. Employing a tight-binding model, we find that interplay\nbetween the interband and intraband dynamics leads to strong harmonic\ngeneration at moderate field amplitudes. Specifically, we find that at low\ntemperature (10 K), the reflected field of undoped suspended bilayer graphene\nexhibits a third harmonic amplitude that is 30% of the fundamental in the\nreflected field for an incident 1 THz single-cycle pulse with a field amplitude\nof 1.5 kV/cm. More interestingly, we find that as the central frequency of the\nincident radiation is increased, the third harmonic amplitude also increases;\nreaching a maximum of 53% for an incident frequency of 2 THz and amplitude of\n2.5 kV/cm.\n", "  The paramagnetic metallic phase of the Anderson-Hubbard model (AHM) is\ninvestigated using a non-perturbative local moment approach within the\nframework of dynamical mean field theory with a typical medium. Our focus is on\nthe breakdown of the metallic phase near the metal-insulators transition as\nseen in the single-particle spectra, scattering rates and the associated\ndistribution of Kondo scales. We demonstrate the emergence of a universal,\nunderlying low energy scale, $T_K^{peak}$. This lies close to the peak of the\ndistribution of Kondo scales obtained within the metallic phase of the\nparamagnetic AHM. Spectral dynamics for energies, $\\omega\\lesssim T_K^{peak}$\ndisplay Fermi liquid universality crossing over to an incoherent universal\ndynamics for $\\omega\\gg T_K^{peak}$ in the scaling regime. Such universal\ndynamics indicate that within a local theory the low to moderately low energy\nphysics is governed by an effective, {\\it disorder renormalised} Kondo\nscreening.\n", "  We report on the single-atom-resolved measurement of the distribution of\nmomenta $\\hbar k$ in a weakly interacting Bose gas after a 330 ms\ntime-of-flight. We investigate it for various temperatures and clearly separate\ntwo contributions to the depletion of the condensate by their $k$-dependence.\nThe first one is the thermal depletion. The second contribution falls of as\n$k^{-4}$, and its magnitude increases with the in-trap condensate density as\npredicted by the Bogoliubov theory at zero temperature. These observations\nsuggest associating it with the quantum depletion. How this contribution can\nsurvive the expansion of the released interacting condensate is an intriguing\nopen question.\n", "  The central region of the Virgo cluster of galaxies contains thousands of\nglobular clusters (GCs), an order of magnitude more than the numbers found in\nthe Local Group. Relics of early star formation epochs in the universe, these\nGCs also provide ideal targets to test our understanding of the Spectral Energy\nDistributions (SEDs) of old stellar populations. Based on photometric data from\nthe Next Generation Virgo cluster Survey (NGVS) and its near-infrared\ncounterpart NGVS-IR, we select a robust sample of 1846 GCs with excellent\nphotometry and spanning the full range of colors present in the Virgo core. The\nselection exploits the well defined locus of GCs in the uiK diagram and the\nfact that the globular clusters are marginally resolved in the images. We show\nthat the GCs define a narrow sequence in 5-dimensional color space, with\nlimited but real dispersion around the mean sequence. The comparison of these\nSEDs with the predictions of eleven widely used population synthesis models\nhighlights differences between models, and also shows that no single model\nadequately matches the data in all colors. We discuss possible causes for some\nof these discrepancies. Forthcoming papers of this series will examine how best\nto estimate photometric metallicities in this context, and compare the Virgo\nglobular cluster colors with those in other environments.\n", "  The external controllability of topological superconductors and Majorana\nfermions would be important both for fundamental and practical interests. Here\nwe predict the electric-field control of Majorana fermions in two-dimensional\ntopological superconductors utilizing a topological insulator thin film\nproximity coupled to a conventional $s$-wave superconductor. With ferromagnetic\nordering, the tunable structure inversion asymmetry by vertical electric field\ncould induce topological quantum phase transition and realize a chiral\ntopological superconductor state. A zero-energy Majorana bound state appears at\nthe boundary of an applied electric field spot, which can be observed by\nscanning tunneling microscopy. Furthermore, the structure inversion asymmetry\ncould also enlarge the helical topological superconductor state in the phase\ndiagram, making the realization of such an exotic state more feasible. The\nelectrical control of topological phases could further apply to van der Waals\nmaterials such as two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides.\n", "  We present the first detection of a jet in the far-IR [O I] lines from an\nintermediate mass protostar. We have carried out a Herschel/PACS spectral\nmapping study in the [O I] lines of OMC-2 FIR 3 and FIR 4, two of the most\nluminous protostars in Orion outside of the Orion Nebula. The spatial\nmorphology of the fine structure line emission reveals the presence of an\nextended photodissociation region (PDR) and a narrow, but intense jet\nconnecting the two protostars. The jet seen in [O I] emission is spatially\naligned with the Spitzer/IRAC 4.5 micron jet and the CO (6-5) molecular outflow\ncentered on FIR 3. The mass loss rate derived from the total [O I] 63 micron\nline luminosity of the jet is 7.7 x 10^-6 M_sun/yr, more than an order of\nmagnitude higher than that measured for typical low mass class 0 protostars.\nThe implied accretion luminosity is significantly higher than the observed\nbolometric luminosity of FIR 4, indicating that the [O I] jet is unlikely to be\nassociated with FIR 4. We argue that the peak line emission seen toward FIR 4\noriginates in the terminal shock produced by the jet driven by FIR 3. The\nhigher mass-loss rate that we find for FIR 3 is consistent with the idea that\nintermediate mass protostars drive more powerful jets than their low-mass\ncounterparts. Our results also call into question the nature of FIR 4.\n", "  In 6D general relativity with a scalar field as a source of gravity, a new\ntype of static wormhole solutions is presented: such wormholes connect our\nuniverse with a small 2D extra subspace with a universe where this extra\nsubspace is large, and the whole space-time is effectively 6-dimensional. We\nconsider manifolds with the structure M0 x M1 x M2 , where M0 is 2D Lorentzian\nspace-time while each of M1 an M2 can be a 2-sphere or a 2-torus. After\nselecting possible asymptotic behaviors of the metric functions compatible with\nthe field equations, we give two explicit examples of wormhole solutions with\nspherical symmetry in our space-time and toroidal extra dimensions. In one\nexample, with a massless scalar field (it is a special case of a well-known\nmore general solution), the extra dimensions have a large constant size at the\n\"far end\"; the other example contains a nonzero potential $V(\\phi)$ which\nprovides a 6D anti-de Sitter asymptotic, where all spatial dimensions are\ninfinite.\n", "  The 16Cyg binary system hosts the solar-like Kepler targets with the most\nstringent observational constraints. Moreover, this system is particularly\ninteresting since both stars are very similar in mass but the A component is\norbited by a red dwarf, whereas the B component is orbited by a Jovian planet\nand thus could have formed a more complex planetary system. In our previous\nstudy, we showed that seismic inversions of integrated quantities could be used\nto constrain microscopic diffusion in the A component. In this study, we\nanalyse the B component in the light of a more regularised inversion. We wish\nto analyse independently the B component of the 16Cyg binary system using the\ninversion of an indicator dedicated to analyse core conditions, denoted tu.\nUsing this independent determination, we wish to analyse any differences\nbetween both stars due to the potential influence of planetary formation on\nstellar structure and/or their respective evolution. First, we recall the\nobservational constraints for 16CygB and the method we used to generate\nreference stellar models. The inversion results were then used to analyse the\ndifferences between the A and B components. The tu indicator for 16CygB shows a\ndisagreement with models including microscopic diffusion and sharing the\nchemical composition previously derived for 16CygA. Small changes in chemical\ncomposition are insufficient to solve the problem but that extra mixing can\naccount for the differences seen between both stars. We use a parametric\napproach to analyse the impact of extra mixing in the form of turbulent\ndiffusion on the behaviour of the tu values. We conclude on the necessity of\nfurther investigations using models with a physically motivated implementation\nof extra mixing including additional constraints to further improve the\naccuracy with which the fundamental parameters of this system are determined.\n", "  We combine the fields of heuristic optimization and optimal stopping. We\npropose a strategy for benchmarking randomized optimization algorithms that\nminimizes the expected total cost for obtaining a good solution with an optimal\nnumber of calls to the solver. To do so, rather than letting the objective\nfunction alone define a cost to be minimized, we introduce a further\ncost-per-call of the algorithm. We show that this problem can be formulated\nusing optimal stopping theory. The expected cost is a flexible figure of merit\nfor benchmarking probabilistic solvers that can be computed when the optimal\nsolution is not known, and that avoids the biases and arbitrariness that affect\nother measures. The optimal stopping formulation of benchmarking directly leads\nto a real-time, optimal-utilization strategy for probabilistic optimizers with\npractical impact. We apply our formulation to benchmark simulated annealing on\na class of MAX2SAT problems. We also compare the performance of a D-Wave 2X\nquantum annealer to the HFS solver, a specialized classical heuristic algorithm\ndesigned for low tree-width graphs. On a set of frustrated-loop instances with\nplanted solutions defined on up to N = 1098 variables, the D-Wave device is two\norders of magnitude faster than the HFS solver, and, modulo known caveats\nrelated to suboptimal annealing times, exhibits identical scaling with problem\nsize.\n", "  Several experimental and theoretical arguments have been made in favor of a\n$d-$wave symmetry for the superconducting state in some Fe-based materials. It\nis a common belief that a $d-$wave gap in the Fe-based superconductors must\nhave nodes on the Fermi surfaces centered at the $\\Gamma$ point of the\nBrillouin zone. Here we show that, while this is the case for a single Fermi\nsurface made out of a single orbital, the situation is more complex if there is\nan even number of Fermi surfaces made out of different orbitals. In particular,\nwe show that for the two $\\Gamma$-centered hole Fermi surfaces made out of\n$d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals, the nodal points still exist near $T_{c}$ along\nthe symmetry-imposed directions, but are are displaced to momenta between the\ntwo Fermi surfaces. If the two hole pockets are close enough, pairs of nodal\npoints can merge and annihilate at some $T<T_{c}$, making the $d-$wave state\ncompletely nodeless. These results imply that photoemission evidence for a\nnodeless gap on the $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ Fermi surfaces of KFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ does\nnot rule out $d-$wave gap symmetry in this material, while a nodeless gap\nobserved on the $d_{xy}$ pocket in K$_{x}$Fe$_{2-y}$Se$_{2}$ is truly\ninconsistent with the $d-$wave gap symmetry.\n", "  We show explicitly how the T model, E model, and Hilltop inflations are\nobtained from the general scalar-tensor theory of gravity with arbitrary\nconformal factors in the strong coupling limit. We argue that $\\xi$ attractors\ncan give any observables $n_s$ and $r$ by this method. The existence of\nattractors imposes a challenge to distinguish different models.\n", "  We calculate the quark self-energy in a quark-gluon plasma that possesses an\nellipsoidal momentum-space anisotropy in the local rest frame. By introducing\nadditional transverse momentum anisotropy parameters into the parton\ndistribution functions, we generalize previous results which were obtained for\nthe case of a spheroidal anisotropy. Our results demonstrate that the presence\nof anisotropies in the transverse directions affects the real and imaginary\nparts of quark self-energy and, consequently, the self-energy depends on both\nthe polar and azimuthal angles in the local rest frame of the matter. Our\nresults for the quark self-energy set the stage for the calculation of the\neffects of ellipsoidal momentum-space anisotropy on quark-gluon plasma photon\nspectra and collective flow.\n", "  We present a new precision radial velocity (RV) dataset that reveals multiple\nplanets orbiting the stars in the $\\sim$360 AU, G2$+$G2 \"twin\" binary HD\n133131AB. Our 6 years of high-resolution echelle observations from MIKE and 5\nyears from PFS on the Magellan telescopes indicate the presence of two\neccentric planets around HD 133131A with minimum masses of 1.43$\\pm$0.03 and\n0.63$\\pm$0.15 $\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm J}$ at 1.44$\\pm$0.005 and 4.79$\\pm$0.92 AU,\nrespectively. Additional PFS observations of HD 133131B spanning 5 years\nindicate the presence of one eccentric planet of minimum mass 2.50$\\pm$0.05\n$\\mathcal{M}_{\\rm J}$ at 6.40$\\pm$0.59 AU, making it one of the longest period\nplanets detected with RV to date. These planets are the first to be reported\nprimarily based on data taken with PFS on Magellan, demonstrating the\ninstrument's precision and the advantage of long-baseline RV observations. We\nperform a differential analysis between the Sun and each star, and between the\nstars themselves, to derive stellar parameters and measure a suite of 21\nabundances across a wide range of condensation temperatures. The host stars are\nold (likely $\\sim$9.5 Gyr) and metal-poor ([Fe/H]$\\sim$-0.30), and we detect a\n$\\sim$0.03 dex depletion in refractory elements in HD 133131A versus B (with\nstandard errors $\\sim$0.017). This detection and analysis adds to a small but\ngrowing sample of binary \"twin\" exoplanet host stars with precise abundances\nmeasured, and represents the most metal-poor and likely oldest in that sample.\nOverall, the planets around HD 133131A and B fall in an unexpected regime in\nplanet mass-host star metallicity space and will serve as an important\nbenchmark for the study of long period giant planets.\n", "  We demonstrate a method to generate spatially homogeneous entangled,\nspin-squeezed states of atoms appropriate for maintaining a large amount of\nsqueezing even after release into the arm of a matter-wave interferometer or\nother free space quantum sensor. Using an effective intracavity dipole trap, we\nallow atoms to move along the cavity axis and time average their coupling to\nthe standing wave used to generate entanglement via collective measurements,\ndemonstrating 11(1) dB of directly observed spin squeezing. Our results show\nthat time averaging in collective measurements can greatly reduce the impact of\nspatially inhomogeneous coupling to the measurement apparatus.\n", "  A new generation of dedicated Doppler spectrographs will attempt to detect\nlow-mass exoplanets around mid-late M stars at near infrared (NIR) wavelengths,\nwhere those stars are brightest and have the most Doppler information content.\nA central requirement for the success of these instruments is to properly\nmeasure the component of radial velocity (RV) variability contributed by\nstellar magnetic activity and to account for it in exoplanet models of RV data.\nThe wavelength coverage for many of these new instruments will not include the\nCa II H&K or H-alpha lines, the most frequently used absorption-line tracers of\nmagnetic activity. Thus, it is necessary to define and characterize NIR\nactivity indicators for mid-late M stars in order to provide simultaneous\nactivity metrics for NIR RV data. We have used the high-cadence UVES\nobservations of the M5.5 dwarf Proxima Centauri from Fuhrmeister et al. (2011)\nto compare the activity sensitivity of 8 NIR atomic lines to that of H-alpha.\nWe find that equivalent width-type measurements of the NIR K I doublet and the\nCa II NIR triplet are excellent proxies for the canonical optical tracers. The\nCa II triplet will be acquired by most of the new and upcoming NIR Doppler\nspectrographs, offering a common, reliable indicator of activity.\n", "  We explore the physics of a Chern insulator subjected to a two step Floquet\ndrive. We analytically obtain the phase diagram and show that the system can\nexhibit different topological phases characterized by presence and chirality of\nedge-modes in the two bulk gaps of the Floquet quasienergy spectrum, around $0$\nand $\\pi$. We find that the phase of the system depends on the mean but not on\nthe amplitude of the drive. The bulk topological invariants characterizing the\nphases can be extracted by mapping the unitary evolution within a time period\nto an energetically trivial but topologically non-trivial time evolution. An\nextensive numerical study of the bulk topological invariants in the presence of\nquenched disorder reveals new transitions induced by strong disorder (i) from\nthe different topological to trivial insulator phases and (ii) from a trivial\nto a topological Anderson insulator phase at intermediate disorder strengths.\nCareful analysis of level statistics of the quasienergy spectrum indicates a\n`levitation-annihilation' mechanism near these transitions.\n", "  We demonstrate that photonic crystals can be used to generate powerful and\nhighly coherent laser radiation when injecting a beam of free electrons. Using\ntheoretical investigations we present the startup dynamics and coherence\nproperties of such laser, in which gain is provided by matching the optical\nphase velocity in the photonic crystal to the velocity of the electron beam.\n", "  It is well known that the extinction properties along lines of sight to Type\nIa supernovae are described by steep extinction curves with unusually low\ntotal-to-selective extinction ratios of Rv = 1.0-2.0. In order to reveal the\nproperties of interstellar dust that causes such peculiar extinction laws, we\nperform the fitting calculations to the measured extinction curves by applying\na two-component dust model composed of graphite and silicate. As for the size\ndistribution of grains, we consider two function forms of the power-law and\nlognormal distributions. We find that the steep extinction curves derived from\nthe one-parameter formula by Cardelli et al. (1989) with Rv = 2.0, 1.5, and 1.0\ncan be reasonably explained even by the simple power-law dust model that has a\nfixed power index of -3.5 with the maximum cut-off radii of a_{max} = 0.13 um,\n0.094 um, and 0.057 um, respectively. These maximum cut-off radii are smaller\nthan a_{max} ~ 0.24 um considered to be valid in the Milky Way, clearly\ndemonstrating that the interstellar dust responsible for steep extinction\ncurves is highly biased to smaller sizes. We show that the lognomal size\ndistribution can also lead to good fits to the extinction curves with Rv =\n1.0-3.1 by taking the appropriate combinations of the relevant parameters. We\ndiscuss that the extinction data at ultraviolet wavelengths are essential for\nconstraining the composition and size distribution of interstellar dust.\n", "  Knowledge of the surface thermal inertia of an asteroid can provide insight\ninto surface structure: porous material has a lower thermal inertia than rock.\nWe develop a means to estimate thermal inertia values of asteroids and use it\nto show that thermal inertia appears to increase with spin period in the case\nof main-belt asteroids (MBAs). Similar behavior is found on the basis of\nthermophysical modeling for near-Earth objects (NEOs). We interpret our results\nin terms of rapidly increasing material density and thermal conductivity with\ndepth, and provide evidence that thermal inertia increases by factors of 10\n(MBAs) to 20 (NEOs) within a depth of just 10 cm. Our results are consistent\nwith a very general picture of rapidly changing material properties in the\ntopmost regolith layers of asteroids and have important implications for\ncalculations of the Yarkovsky effect, including its perturbation of the orbits\nof potentially hazardous objects and those of asteroid family members after the\nbreak-up event. Evidence of a rapid increase of thermal inertia with depth is\nalso an important result for studies of the ejecta-enhanced momentum transfer\nof impacting vehicles (\"kinetic impactors\") in planetary defense.\n", "  We present a microscopic theory of the equilibrium polariton condensate state\nof a semiconductor quantum well in a planar optical cavity. The theory accounts\nfor the adjustment of matter excitations to the presence of a coherent photon\nfield, predicts effective polariton-polariton interaction strengths that are\nweaker and condensate exciton fractions that are smaller than in the commonly\nemployed exciton-photon model, and yields effective Rabi coupling strengths\nthat depend on the detuning of the cavity photon energy relative to the bare\nexciton energy. The dressed quasiparticle bands that appear naturally in the\ntheory provide a mechanism for electrical manipulation of polariton\ncondensates.\n", "  We present theoretical constraints for the formation of the newly discovered\ndark star clusters (DSCs) with high mass-to-light (M/L) ratios, from Taylor et\nal (2015). These compact stellar systems photometrically resemble globular\nclusters (GCs) but have dynamical M/L ratios of ~ 10 - 100, closer to the\nexpectations for dwarf galaxies. The baryonic properties of the dark star\nclusters (DSCs) suggest their host dark matter halos likely virialized at high\nredshift with M > 10^8 M_sun. We use a new set of high-resolution N-body\nsimulations of Centaurus A to determine if there is a set of z=0 subhalos whose\nproperties are in line with these observations. While we find such a set of\nsubhalos, when we extrapolate the dark matter density profiles into the inner\n20 pc, no dark matter halo associated with Centaurus A in our simulations, at\nany redshift, can replicate the extremely high central mass densities of the\nDSCs. Among the most likely options for explaining 10^5 - 10^7 M_sun within 10\npc diameter subhalos is the presence of a central massive black hole. We,\ntherefore, propose that the DSCs are remnant cusps of stellar systems\nsurrounding the central black holes of dwarf galaxies which have been almost\ncompletely destroyed by interactions with Centaurus A.\n", "  The first wind nebula around a magnetar was recently discovered in X-rays\naround Swift~J1834.9$-$0846. We study this magnetar's global energetics and the\nproperties of its particle wind or outflows. At a distance of $\\sim4\\;$kpc,\nSwift~J1834.9$-$0846 is located at the center of the supernova remnant (SNR)\nW41 whose radius is $\\sim 19\\;$pc, an order of magnitude larger than that of\nthe X-ray nebula ($\\sim2\\;$pc). The association with SNR W41 suggests a common\nage of $\\sim5-100\\;$kyr, while its spin-down age is $4.9$~kyr. A small natal\nkick velocity may partly explain why a wind nebula was detected around this\nmagnetar but not around other magnetars, most of which appear to have larger\nkick velocities and may have exited their birth SNR. We find that the GeV and\nTeV source detected by Fermi/LAT and H.E.S.S., respectively, of radius\n$\\sim11\\;$pc is most likely of hadronic origin. The dynamics and internal\nstructure of the nebula are examined analytically to explain the nebula's\ncurrent properties. Its size may naturally correspond to the\ndiffusion-dominated cooling length of the X-ray emitting $e^+e^-$ pairs. This\nmay also account for the spectral softening of the X-ray emission from the\nnebula's inner to outer parts. Analysis of the X-ray synchrotron nebula implies\nthat (i) the nebular magnetic field is $\\gtrsim 11\\;\\mu$G (and likely\n$\\lesssim30\\;\\mu$G), and (ii) the nebula is not powered predominantly by the\nmagnetar's quiescent spin-down-powered MHD wind, but by other outflows that\ncontribute most of its energy. The latter are most likely associated with the\nmagnetar's bursting activity, and possibly dominated by outflows associated\nwith its past giant flares. The energy source for the required outflows cannot\nbe the decay of the magnetar's dipole field alone, and is most likely the decay\nof its much stronger internal magnetic field.\n", "  In this paper the phase diagram of Dirac semimetals is studied within lattice\nMonte-Carlo simulation. In particular, we concentrate on the dynamical chiral\nsymmetry breaking which results in semimetal/insulator transition. Using\nnumerical simulation we determined the values of the critical coupling constant\nof the semimetal/insulator transition for different values of the anisotropy of\nthe Fermi velocity. This measurement allowed us to draw tentative phase diagram\nfor Dirac semimetals. It turns out that within the Dirac model with Coulomb\ninteraction both Na$_3$Bi and Cd$_3$As$_2$ known experimentally to be Dirac\nsemimetals would lie deeply in the insulating region of the phase diagram. It\nprobably shows a decisive role of screening of the interelectron interaction in\nreal materials, similar to the situation in graphene.\n", "  We propose a model solely based on actin treadmilling and polymerisation\nwhich describes many characteristic states of actin wave formation: spots,\nspirals and travelling waves. In our model, as in experiments on cell\nrecovering motility following actin depolymerisation, we choose an isotropic\nlow density initial condition; polymerisation of actin filaments then raises\nthe density towards the Onsager threshold where they align. We show that this\nalignment, in turn, destabilizes the isotropic phase and generically induces\ntransient actin spots or spirals as part of the dynamical pathway towards a\npolarized phase which can either be uniform or consist of a series of\nactin-wave trains (flocks). Our results uncover a universal route to actin wave\nformation in the absence of any system specific nonlinear biochemistry, and it\nmay help understand the mechanism underlying the observation of actin spots and\nwaves in vivo. They also suggest a minimal setup to design similar patterns in\nvitro.\n", "  We present a brief survey of fluctuations and large deviations of particle\nsystems with subextensive growth of the variance. These are called hyperuniform\n(or superhomogeneous) systems. We then discuss the relation between\nhyperuniformity and rigidity. In particular we give sufficient conditions for\nrigidity of such systems in d=1,2.\n", "  We continue the study of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model in the Large $N$ limit.\nFollowing our formulation in terms of bi-local collective fields with dynamical\nreparametrization symmetry, we perform perturbative calculations around the\nconformal IR point.\n", "  The outer heliosphere is a dynamic region shaped largely by the interaction\nbetween the solar wind and the interstellar medium. While interplanetary\nmagnetic field and plasma observations by the Voyager spacecraft have\nsignificantly improved our understanding of this vast region, modeling the\nouter heliosphere still remains a challenge. We simulate the three-dimensional,\ntime-dependent solar wind flow from 1 to 80 astronomical units (AU), where the\nsolar wind is assumed to be supersonic, using a two-fluid model in which\nprotons and interstellar neutral hydrogen atoms are treated as separate fluids.\nWe use 1-day averages of the solar wind parameters from the OMNI data set as\ninner boundary conditions to reproduce time-dependent effects in a simplified\nmanner which involves interpolation in both space and time. Our model generally\nagrees with Ulysses data in the inner heliosphere and Voyager data in the outer\nheliosphere. Ultimately, we present the model solar wind parameters extracted\nalong the trajectory of New Horizons spacecraft. We compare our results with in\nsitu plasma data taken between 11 and 33 AU and at the closest approach to\nPluto on July 14, 2015.\n", "  Einstein's weak equivalence principle (EEP) can be tested through the arrival\ntime delay between photons with different frequencies. Assuming that the\narrival time delay is solely caused by the gravitational potential of the Milky\nWay, we show that a \"nano-shot\" giant pulse with a time delay between energies\ncorrected for all known effects, e.g. $\\Delta t<0.4~\\rm{ns}$, from the Crab\npulsar poses a new upper limit on the deviation from EEP, i.e. $\\Delta\\gamma <\n(0.6-1.8)\\times 10^{-15}$. This result provides the hitherto most stringent\nconstraint on the EEP, improving by at least 2 to 3 orders of magnitude from\nthe previous results based on fast radio bursts.\n", "  We study the effects of charge degrees of freedom on the spin excitation\ndynamics in quasi-one dimensional magnetic materials. Using the density matrix\nrenormalization group method, we calculate the dynamical spin structure factor\nof the Hubbard model at half electronic filling on a chain and on a ladder\ngeometry, and compare the results with those obtained using the Heisenberg\nmodel, where charge degrees of freedom are considered frozen. For both chains\nand two-leg ladders, we find that the Hubbard model spectrum qualitatively\nresembles the Heisenberg spectrum -- with low-energy peaks resembling spinonic\nexcitations -- already at intermediate on-site repulsion as small as $U/t \\sim\n2-3$, although ratios of peak intensities at different momenta continue\nevolving with increasing $U/t$ converging only slowly to the Heisenberg limit.\nWe discuss the implications of these results for neutron scattering experiments\nand we propose criteria to establish the values of $U/t$ of quasi-one\ndimensional systems described by one-orbital Hubbard models from experimental\ninformation.\n", "  Measuring the local temperature of nanoscale systems out of equilibrium has\nemerged as a new tool to study local heating effects and other local thermal\nproperties of systems driven by external fields. Although various experimental\nprotocols and theoretical definitions have been proposed to determine the local\ntemperature, the thermodynamic meaning of the measured or defined quantities\nremains unclear. By performing analytical and numerical analysis of bias-driven\nquantum dot systems both in the noninteracting and strongly-correlated regimes,\nwe elucidate the underlying physical meaning of local temperature as determined\nby two definitions: the zero-current condition that is widely used but not\nmeasurable, and the minimal-perturbation condition that is experimentally\nrealizable. We show that, unlike the zero-current one, the local temperature\ndetermined by the minimalperturbation protocol establishes a quantitative\ncorrespondence between the nonequilibrium system of interest and a reference\nequilibrium system, provided the probed system observable and the related\nelectronic excitations are fully local. The quantitative correspondence thus\nallows the well-established thermodynamic concept to be extended to\nnonequilibrium situations.\n", "  The Chinese Small Telescope ARray (CSTAR) is the first Chinese astronomical\ninstrument placed in Antarctica. It is a group of four identical, fully\nautomatic $14.5\\,\\rm{cm}$ telescopes, with an field of view (FOV) of\n$20\\,\\rm{deg^2}$ centered on the South Celestial Pole. Placed at Antarctic Dome\nA, CSTAR is designed to provide high-cadence photometry for site monitoring and\nvariable sources detection. During the 2008 observing season, CSTAR has taken\nhigh-precision photometric data for 18,145 stars around the South Celestial\nPole. At $i\\,=\\,7.5$ and $12$, the photometric precision reaches $\\sim 8$ mmag\nand $\\sim 30$ mmag with a cadence of 20s or 30s, respectively. Using robust\ndetection method, we have found 15 stellar flares on 13 sources, including two\nclassified variables. We have also found a linear relation between the decay\ntimes and the total durations of the stellar flares. The details of all\ndetected flares along with their stellar properties are presented in this work.\n", "  We present results from the first 3D kinetic numerical simulation of\nmagnetorotational turbulence and dynamo, using the local shearing-box model of\na collisionless accretion disc. The kinetic magnetorotational instability grows\nfrom a subthermal magnetic field having zero net flux over the computational\ndomain to generate self-sustained turbulence and outward angular-momentum\ntransport. Significant Maxwell and Reynolds stresses are accompanied by\ncomparable viscous stresses produced by field-aligned ion pressure anisotropy,\nwhich is regulated primarily by the mirror and ion-cyclotron instabilities\nthrough particle trapping and pitch-angle scattering. The latter endow the\nplasma with an effective viscosity that is biased with respect to the\nmagnetic-field direction and spatio-temporally variable. Energy spectra suggest\nan Alfv\\'en-wave cascade at large scales and a kinetic-Alfv\\'en-wave cascade at\nsmall scales, with strong small-scale density fluctuations and weak\nnon-axisymmetric density waves. Ions undergo non-thermal particle acceleration,\ntheir distribution accurately described by a kappa distribution. These results\nhave implications for the properties of low-collisionality accretion flows,\nsuch as that near the black hole at the Galactic center.\n", "  We use gauge/string duality to estimate the Debye screening mass at non-zero\ntemperature and baryon chemical potential. We interpret this mass as the\nsmallest one in the open string channel. Comparisons are made with the results\nfrom holography and lattice QCD.\n", "  We investigate the optical polarization properties of high-energy BL Lac\nobjects using data from the RoboPol blazar monitoring program and the Nordic\nOptical Telescope. We wish to understand if there are differences in the BL Lac\nobjects that are detected with the current-generation TeV instruments compared\nto those that have not yet been detected. The mean polarization fraction of the\nTeV-detected BL Lacs is 5% while the non-TeV sources show a higher mean\npolarization fraction of 7%. This difference in polarization fraction\ndisappears when the dilution by the unpolarized light of the host galaxy is\naccounted for. The TeV sources show somewhat lower fractional polarization\nvariability amplitudes than the non-TeV sources. Also the fraction of sources\nwith a smaller spread in the Q/I - U/I -plane and a clumped distribution of\npoints away from the origin, possibly indicating a preferred polarization\nangle, is larger in the TeV than in the non-TeV sources. These differences\nbetween TeV and non-TeV samples seems to arise from differences between\nintermediate and high spectral peaking sources instead of the TeV detection.\nWhen the EVPA variations are studied, the rate of EVPA change is similar in\nboth samples. We detect significant EVPA rotations in both TeV and non-TeV\nsources, showing that rotations can occur in high spectral peaking BL Lac\nobjects when the monitoring cadence is dense enough. Our simulations show that\nwe cannot exclude a random walk origin for these rotations. These results\nindicate that there are no intrinsic differences in the polarization properties\nof the TeV-detected and non-TeV-detected high-energy BL Lac objects. This\nsuggests that the polarization properties are not directly related to the\nTeV-detection, but instead the TeV loudness is connected to the general flaring\nactivity, redshift, and the synchrotron peak location. (Abridged)\n", "  In this short paper we look at the action of T-duality and string duality\ngroups on fermions, in maximally-supersymmetric theories and related theories.\nBriefly, we argue that typical duality groups such as SL(2,Z) have sign\nambiguities in their actions on fermions, and propose that pertinent duality\ngroups be extended by Z_2, to groups such as the metaplectic group.\nSpecifically, we look at duality groups arising from mapping class groups of\ntori in M theory compactifications, T-duality, ten-dimensional type IIB\nS-duality, and (briefly) four-dimensional N=4 super Yang-Mills, and in each\ncase, propose that the full duality group is a nontrivial Z_2 extension of the\nduality group acting on bosonic degrees of freedom, to more accurately describe\npossible actions on fermions. We also walk through U-duality groups for\ntoroidal compactifications to nine, eight, and seven dimensions, which enables\nus to perform cross-consistency tests of these proposals.\n", "  We report the experimental observation of the bifurcation at the origin of\nlocalization of the deformation in a granular material submitted to uniaxial\ncompression. We present a quantitative characterization of the heterogeneity in\nthe strain field repartition allowing to evidence objectively the existence of\na bifurcation initiating the shear bands formation process. We show that this\nbifurcation is supercritical and has no clear signature on the stress-strain\ncurve. At the bifurcation, a symmetry breaking occurs characterized by the\nemergence of a well-defined orientation corresponding to the Mohr-Coulomb\nangle. Yet, plasticity is still diffuse and the shear band extension is of the\norder of the sample width. While loading proceeds, the shear band narrows until\nit reaches, after the peak of the stress-strain curve, a stationary width.\n", "  We report on INTEGRAL, Swift and XMM-Newton observations of IGR J17511-3057\nperformed during the outburst that occurred between March 23 and April 25,\n2015. The source reached a peak flux of 0.7(2)E-9 erg/cm$^2$/s and decayed to\nquiescence in approximately a month. The X-ray spectrum was dominated by a\npower-law with photon index between 1.6 and 1.8, which we interpreted as\nthermal Comptonization in an electron cloud with temperature > 20 keV . A broad\n({\\sigma} ~ 1 keV) emission line was detected at an energy (E =\n6.9$^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$ keV) compatible with the K{\\alpha} transition of ionized\nFe, suggesting an origin in the inner regions of the accretion disk. The\noutburst flux and spectral properties shown during this outburst were\nremarkably similar to those observed during the previous accretion event\ndetected from the source in 2009. Coherent pulsations at the pulsar spin period\nwere detected in the XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL data, at a frequency compatible\nwith the value observed in 2009. Assuming that the source spun up during the\n2015 outburst at the same rate observed during the previous outburst, we derive\na conservative upper limit on the spin down rate during quiescence of 3.5E-15\nHz/s. Interpreting this value in terms of electromagnetic spin down yields an\nupper limit of 3.6E26 G/cm$^3$ to the pulsar magnetic dipole (assuming a\nmagnetic inclination angle of 30{\\deg}). We also report on the detection of\nfive type-I X-ray bursts (three in the XMM-Newton data, two in the INTEGRAL\ndata), none of which indicated photospheric radius expansion.\n", "  We present theoretical studies of condensation of indirect excitons in a\ntrap. Our model quantifies the effect of screening of the trap potential by\nindirect excitons on exciton condensation. The theoretical studies are applied\nto a system of indirect excitons in a GaAs/AlGaAs coupled quantum well\nstructure in a diamond-shaped electrostatic trap where exciton condensation was\nstudied in earlier experiments. The estimated condensation temperature of the\nindirect excitons in the trap reaches hundreds of milliKelvin.\n", "  Extended inverse Compton halos are generally anticipated around extragalactic\nsources of gamma rays with energies above 100 GeV. These result from inverse\nCompton scattered cosmic microwave background photons by a population of\nhigh-energy electron/positron pairs produced by the annihilation of the\nhigh-energy gamma rays on the infrared background. Despite the observed\nattenuation of the high-energy gamma rays, the halo emission has yet to be\ndirectly detected. Here, we demonstrate that in most cases these halos are\nexpected to be highly anisotropic, distributing the up-scattered gamma rays\nalong axes defined either by the radio jets of the sources or oriented\nperpendicular to a global magnetic field. We present a pedagogical derivation\nof the angular structure in the inverse Compton halo and provide an analytic\nformalism that facilitates the generation of mock images. We discuss exploiting\nthis fact for the purpose of detecting gamma-ray halos in a set of companion\npapers.\n", "  Aims: We investigate the evolution of protoplanetary discs (PPDs hereafter)\nwith magnetically driven disc winds and viscous heating. Methods: We consider\nan initially massive disc with ~0.1 Msun to track the evolution from the early\nstage of PPDs. We solve the time evolution of surface density and temperature\nby taking into account viscous heating and the loss of the mass and the angular\nmomentum by the disc winds within the framework of a standard alpha model for\naccretion discs. Our model parameters, turbulent viscosity, disc wind mass\nloss, and disc wind torque, which are adopted from local magnetohydrodynamical\nsimulations and constrained by the global energetics of the gravitational\naccretion, largely depends on the physical condition of PPDs, particularly on\nthe evolution of the vertical magnetic flux in weakly ionized PPDs. Results:\nAlthough there are still uncertainties concerning the evolution of the vertical\nmagnetic flux remaining, surface densities show a large variety, depending on\nthe combination of these three parameters, some of which are very different\nfrom the surface density expected from the standard accretion. When a PPD is in\na \"wind-driven accretion\" state with the preserved vertical magnetic field, the\nradial dependence of the surface density can be positive in the inner region\n<1-10 au. The mass accretion rates are consistent with observations, even in\nthe very low level of magnetohydrodynamical turbulence. Such a positive radial\nslope of the surface density gives a great impact on planet formation because\n(i)it inhibits the inward drift or even results in the outward drift of\npebble/boulder-sized solid bodies, and (ii) it also makes the inward type-I\nmigration of proto-planets slower or even reversed. Conclusions: The variety of\nour calculated PPDs should yield a wide variety of exoplanet systems.\n", "  A model for strongly writhing confined solar eruptions suggests an origin in\nthe helical kink instability of a coronal flux rope which remains stable\nagainst the torus instability. This model is tested against the well observed\nfilament eruption on 2002 May 27 in a parametric MHD simulation study which\ncomprises all phases of the event. Good agreement with the essential observed\nproperties is obtained. These include the confinement, terminal height,\nwrithing, distortion, and dissolution of the filament, and the flare loops. The\nagreement is robust against variations in a representative range of parameter\nspace. Careful comparisons with the observation data constrain the ratio of the\nexternal toroidal and poloidal field components to\n$B_\\mathrm{et}/B_\\mathrm{ep}\\approx1$ and the initial flux rope twist to\n$\\Phi\\approx4\\pi$. Different from ejective eruptions, two distinct phases of\nstrong magnetic reconnection can occur. First, the erupting flux is cut by\nreconnection with overlying flux in the helical current sheet formed by the\ninstability. If the resulting flux bundles are linked as a consequence of the\nerupting rope's strong writhing, they subsequently reconnect in the vertical\ncurrent sheet between them. This reforms the overlying flux and a far less\ntwisted flux rope, offering a pathway to homologous eruptions.\n", "  Multiple outbursts of a Jupiter-family comet, 15P/Finlay, occurred from late\n2014 to early 2015. We conducted an observation of the comet after the first\noutburst and subsequently witnessed another outburst on 2015 January 15.6-15.7.\nThe gas, consisting mostly of C2 and CN, and dust particles expanded at speeds\nof 1,110 +/- 180 m/s and 570 +/- 40 m/s at a heliocentric distance of 1.0 AU.\nWe estimated the maximum ratio of solar radiation pressure with respect to the\nsolar gravity beta_max = 1.6 +/- 0.2, which is consistent with porous dust\nparticles composed of silicates and organics. We found that 10^8-10^9 kg of\ndust particles (assumed to be 0.3 micron - 1 mm) were ejected through each\noutburst. Although the total mass is three orders of magnitude smaller than\nthat of the 17P/Holmes event observed in 2007, the kinetic energy per unit mass\n(104 J/kg) is equivalent to the estimated values of 17P/Holmes and 332P/2010 V1\n(Ikeya-Murakami), suggesting that the outbursts were caused by a similar\nphysical mechanism. From a survey of cometary outbursts on the basis of\nvoluntary reports, we conjecture that 15P/Finlay-class outbursts occur >1.5\ntimes annually and inject dust particles from Jupiter-family comets and\nEncke-type comets into interplanetary space at a rate of ~10 kg/s or more.\n", "  We perform the first iterative Monte Carlo (IMC) analysis of fragmentation\nfunctions constrained by all available data from single-inclusive $e^+ e^-$\nannihilation into pions and kaons. The IMC method eliminates potential bias in\ntraditional analyses based on single fits introduced by fixing parameters not\nwell contrained by the data and provides a statistically rigorous determination\nof uncertainties. Our analysis reveals specific features of fragmentation\nfunctions using the new IMC methodology and those obtained from previous\nanalyses, especially for light quarks and for strange quark fragmentation to\nkaons.\n", "  We compute, for the first time, self-consistent models of planet growth\nincluding the effect of envelope enrichment. The change of envelope metallicity\nis assumed to be the result of planetesimal disruption or icy pebble\nsublimation. We solve internal structure equations taking into account global\nenergy conservation for the envelope to compute in-situ planetary growth. We\nconsider different opacities and equations of state suited for a wide range of\nmetallicities. We find that envelope enrichment speeds up the formation of gas\ngiants. It also explains naturally the formation of low and intermediate mass\nobjects with large fractions of H-He (~ 20 - 30 % in mass). High opacity models\nexplain well the metallicity of the giant planets of the solar system, whereas\nlow opacity models are suited for forming small mass objects with thick H-He\nenvelopes and gas giants with sub-solar envelope metallicities. We find good\nagreement between our models and the estimated water abundance for WASP-43b.\nFor HD 189733b, HD 209458b and WASP-12b we predict fractions of water larger\nthan what is estimated from observations, by at least a factor ~ 2. Envelope\nenrichment by icy planetesimals is the natural scenario to explain the\nformation of a large variety of objects, ranging from mini-Neptunes, to gas\ngiants. We predict that the total and envelope metallicity decrease with\nplanetary mass.\n", "  Nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations endowed with curl drift forces are\ninvestigated. The conditions under which these evolution equations admit\nstationary solutions, which are $q$-exponentials of an appropriate potential\nfunction, are determined. It is proved that when these stationary solutions\nexist, the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations satisfy an $H$-theorem in terms of\na free-energy like quantity involving the $S_q$ entropy. A particular two\ndimensional model admitting analytical, time-dependent, $q$-Gaussian solutions\nis discussed in detail. This model describes a system of particles with\nshort-range interactions, performing overdamped motion under drag effects, due\nto a rotating resisting medium. It is related to models that have been recently\napplied to the study of type-II superconductors. The relevance of the present\ndevelopments to the study of complex systems in physics, astronomy, and\nbiology, is discussed.\n", "  We investigate the topological properties of unquenched $QCD$ on the basis of\nnumerical results of simulations at fixed topological charge, recently reported\nby Borsanyi et al.. We demonstrate that their results for the mean value of the\nchiral condensate at fixed topological charge are inconsistent with the\nanalytical prediction of the large volume expansion around the saddle point,\nand argue that the most plausible explanation for the failure of the saddle\npoint expansion is a vacuum energy density $\\theta$-independent at high\ntemperatures, but surprisingly not too high $(T\\sim 2T_c)$, a result which\nwould imply a vanishing topological susceptibility, and the absence of all\nphysical effects of the $U(1)$ axial anomaly at these temperatures. We also\nshow that under a general assumption concerning the high temperature phase of\n$QCD$, where the $SU(N_f)_A$ symmetry is restored, the analytical prediction\nfor the chiral condensate at fixed topological charge is in very good agreement\nwith the numerical results of Borsanyi et al., all effects of the axial anomaly\nshould disappear, the topological susceptibility and all the\n$\\theta$-derivatives of the vacuum energy density vanish and the theory becomes\n$\\theta$-independent at any $T>T_c$ in the infinite volume limit.\n", "  Finite group theorists have established many formulas that express\ninteresting properties of a finite group in terms of sums of characters of the\ngroup. An obstacle to applying these formulas is lack of control over the\ndimensions of representations of the group. In particular, the representations\nof small dimensions tend to contribute the largest terms to these sums, so a\nsystematic knowledge of these small representations could lead to proofs of\nimportant conjectures which are currently out of reach. Despite the\nclassification by Lusztig of the irreducible representations of finite groups\nof Lie type, it seems that this aspect remains obscure. In this note we develop\na language which seems to be adequate for the description of the \"small\"\nrepresentations of finite classical groups and puts in the forefront the notion\nof rank of a representation. We describe a method, the \"eta correspondence\", to\nconstruct small representations, and we conjecture that our construction is\nexhaustive. We also give a strong estimate on the dimension of small\nrepresentations in terms of their rank. For the sake of clarity, in this note\nwe describe in detail only the case of the finite symplectic groups.\n", "  We investigate the early Universe production of sterile neutrino Dark Matter\nby the decays of singlet scalars. All previous studies applied simplifying\nassumptions and/or studied the process only on the level of number densities,\nwhich makes it impossible to give statements about cosmic structure formation.\nWe overcome these issues by dropping all simplifying assumptions (except for\none we showed earlier to work perfectly) and by computing the full course of\nDark Matter production on the level of non-thermal momentum distribution\nfunctions. We are thus in the position to study all aspects of the resulting\nsettings and apply all relevant bounds in a reliable manner. We have a\nparticular focus on how to incorporate bounds from structure formation on the\nlevel of the linear power spectrum, since the simplistic estimate using the\nfree-streaming horizon clearly fails for highly non-thermal distributions. Our\nwork comprises the most detailed and comprehensive study of sterile neutrino\nDark Matter production by scalar decays presented so far.\n", "  It is understood that in free bosonic theories, the classical field theory\naccurately describes the full quantum theory when the occupancy numbers of\nsystems are very large. However, the situation is less understood in\ninteracting theories, especially on time scales longer than the dynamical\nrelaxation time. Recently there have been claims that the quantum theory\ndeviates spectacularly from the classical theory on this time scale, even if\nthe occupancy numbers are extremely large. Furthermore, it is claimed that the\nquantum theory quickly thermalizes while the classical theory does not. The\nevidence for these claims comes from noticing a spectacular difference in the\ntime evolution of expectation values of quantum operators compared to the\nclassical micro-state evolution. If true, this would have dramatic consequences\nfor many important phenomena, including laboratory studies of interacting BECs,\ndark matter axions, preheating after inflation, etc. In this work we critically\nexamine these claims. We show that in fact the classical theory can describe\nthe quantum behavior in the high occupancy regime, even when interactions are\nlarge. The connection is that the expectation values of quantum operators in a\nsingle quantum micro-state are approximated by a corresponding classical\nensemble average over many classical micro-states. Furthermore, by the ergodic\ntheorem, a classical ensemble average of local fields with statistical\ntranslation invariance is the spatial average of a single micro-state. So the\ncorrelation functions of the quantum and classical field theories of a single\nmicro-state approximately agree at high occupancy, even in interacting systems.\nFurthermore, both quantum and classical field theories can thermalize, when\nappropriate coarse graining is introduced, with the classical case requiring a\ncutoff on low occupancy UV modes. We discuss applications of our results.\n", "  Pairs fluctuation supercurrents and inverse lifetimes were measured on\nepitaxial c-axis junctions of the cuprates in the pseudogap regime, with a\n$PrBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\\delta}$ barrier sandwiched in between two\n$YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\\delta}$ or doped $YBa_2Cu_3O_y$ electrodes, with or without\nmagnetic fields parallel to the a-b planes. All junctions had a $\\rm\nT_c(high)\\approx 85-90$ K and a $\\rm T_c(low)\\approx 50-55$ K electrodes,\nallowing us to study pairs fluctuation supercurrents and inverse life times in\nbetween these two temperatures. In junctions with a pseudogap electrode under\nzero field, an excesss current due to pair fluctuations was observed which\npersisted at temperatures above $\\rm T_c(low)$, in the pseudogap regime, and up\nto about $\\rm T_c(high)$. No such excess current was observed in junctions\nwithout a pseudo-gap in the electrode. The measured conductance spectra at\ntemperatures above $\\rm T_c(low)$ were fitted using a modified fluctuations\nmodel by Scalapino [Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{24}, 1052(1970)] of a junction\nwith a serial resistance. We found that in the pseudo-gap regime, the\nconductance vs voltage consists of a narrow peak sitting on top of a very broad\npeak. This yielded two distinct pairs fluctuation lifetimes in the pseudogap\nelectrode which differ by an order of magnitude up to about $\\rm T_c(high)$.\nUnder in-plane fields, these two lifetime values remain separated in two\ndistinct groups, which varied with increasing field moderately. We also found\nthat detection of Amperian pairing [Phys. Rev. X \\textbf{4}, 031017 (2014)] in\nour cuprate junctions is not feasible, due to Josephson vortices penetration\ninto the superconducting electrodes which drove the necessary field above the\ndepairing field.\n", "  A two-loop induced radiative neutrino model is proposed as an extension of\nour previous work in which the first and second generation standard model\nfermion masses are generated at one-loop level in both quark and lepton\nsectors. Then we discuss current neutrino oscillation data, lepton flavor\nviolations, muon anomalous magnetic moment, and a bosonic dark matter\ncandidate, for both the normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. Our\nnumerical analysis shows that less hierarchical Yukawa coupling constants can\nfit the experimental data with TeV scale dark matter.\n", "  Arch filament systems occur in active sunspot groups, where a fibril\nstructure connects areas of opposite magnetic polarity, in contrast to active\nregion filaments that follow the polarity inversion line. We used the GREGOR\nInfrared Spectrograph (GRIS) to obtain the full Stokes vector in the spectral\nlines Si I 1082.7 nm, He I 1083.0 nm, and Ca I 1083.9 nm. We focus on the\nnear-infrared calcium line to investigate the photospheric magnetic field and\nvelocities, and use the line core intensities and velocities of the helium line\nto study the chromospheric plasma. The individual fibrils of the arch filament\nsystem connect the sunspot with patches of magnetic polarity opposite to that\nof the spot. These patches do not necessarily coincide with pores, where the\nmagnetic field is strongest. Instead, areas are preferred not far from the\npolarity inversion line. These areas exhibit photospheric downflows of moderate\nvelocity, but significantly higher downflows of up to 30 km/s in the\nchromospheric helium line. Our findings can be explained with new emerging flux\nwhere the matter flows downward along the fieldlines of rising flux tubes, in\nagreement with earlier results.\n", "  By absorbing fluctuations into a local background, separate universe\nsimulations provide a powerful technique to characterize the response of\nsmall-scale observables to the long-wavelength density fluctuations, for\nexample those of the power spectrum and halo mass function which lead to the\nsqueezed-limit $n$-point function and halo bias, respectively. Using\nquintessence dark energy as the paradigmatic example, we extend these\nsimulation techniques to cases where non-gravitational forces in other sectors\nestablish a Jeans scale across which the growth of density fluctuations becomes\nscale dependent. By characterizing the separate universes with matching\nbackground expansion histories, we show that the power spectrum and mass\nfunction responses depend on whether the long-wavelength mode is above or below\nthe Jeans scale. Correspondingly, the squeezed bispectrum and halo bias also\nbecome scale dependent. Models of bias that are effectively local in the\ndensity field at a single epoch, initial or observed, cannot describe this\neffect which highlights the importance of temporal nonlocality in structure\nformation. Validated by these quintessence tests, our techniques are applicable\nto a wide range of models where the complex dynamics of additional fields\naffect the clustering of matter in the linear regime and it would otherwise be\ndifficult to simulate their impact in the nonlinear regime.\n", "  We use the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamic simulation suite to study the\nspecific angular momentum of galaxies, $j$, with the aims of (i) investigating\nthe physical causes behind the wide range of $j$ at fixed mass and (ii)\nexamining whether simple, theoretical models can explain the seemingly complex\nand non-linear nature of the evolution of $j$. We find that $j$ of the stars,\n$j_{\\rm stars}$, and baryons, $j_{\\rm bar}$, are strongly correlated with\nstellar and baryon mass, respectively, with the scatter being highly correlated\nwith morphological proxies such as gas fraction, stellar concentration, (u-r)\nintrinsic colour, stellar age and the ratio of circular velocity to velocity\ndispersion. We compare with available observations at $z=0$ and find excellent\nagreement. We find that $j_{\\rm bar}$ follows the theoretical expectation of an\nisothermal collapsing halo under conservation of specific angular momentum to\nwithin $\\approx 50$%, while the subsample of rotation-supported galaxies are\nequally well described by a simple model in which the disk angular momentum is\njust enough to maintain marginally stable disks. We extracted evolutionary\ntracks of the stellar spin parameter of EAGLE galaxies and found that the fate\nof their $j_{\\rm stars}$ at $z=0$ depends sensitively on their star formation\nand merger histories. From these tracks, we identified two distinct physical\nchannels behind low $j_{\\rm stars}$ galaxies at $z=0$: (i) galaxy mergers, and\n(ii) early star formation quenching. The latter can produce galaxies with low\n$j_{\\rm stars}$ and early-type morphologies even in the absence of mergers.\n", "  We describe a new method of reduced Google matrix which allows to establish\ndirect and hidden links between a subset of nodes of a large directed network.\nThis approach uses parallels with quantum scattering theory, developed for\nprocesses in nuclear and mesoscopic physics and quantum chaos. The method is\napplied to the Wikipedia networks in different language editions analyzing\nseveral groups of political leaders of USA, UK, Germany, France, Russia and\nG20. We demonstrate that this approach allows to recover reliably direct and\nhidden links among political leaders. We argue that the reduced Google matrix\nmethod can form the mathematical basis for studies in social and political\nsciences analyzing Leader-Members eXchange (LMX).\n", "  Astrophysical images issued from different instruments and/or spectral bands\noften require to be processed together, either for fitting or comparison\npurposes. However each image is affected by an instrumental response, also\nknown as PSF, that depends on the characteristics of the instrument as well as\nthe wavelength and the observing strategy. Given the knowledge of the PSF in\neach band, a straightforward way of processing images is to homogenise them all\nto a target PSF using convolution kernels, so that they appear as if they had\nbeen acquired by the same instrument. We propose an algorithm that generates\nsuch PSF-matching kernels, based on Wiener filtering with a tunable\nregularisation parameter. This method ensures all anisotropic features in the\nPSFs to be taken into account. We compare our method to existing procedures\nusing measured Herschel/PACS and SPIRE PSFs and simulated JWST/MIRI PSFs.\nSignificant gains up to two orders of magnitude are obtained with respect to\nthe use of kernels computed assuming Gaussian or circularised PSFs.\n", "  Although massless Dirac fermions in graphene constitute a centrosymmetric\nmedium for in-plane excitations, their second-order nonlinear optical response\nis nonzero if the effects of spatial dispersion are taken into account. Here we\npresent a rigorous quantum-mechanical theory of the second-order nonlinear\nresponse of graphene beyond the electric dipole approximation, which includes\nboth intraband and interband transitions. The resulting nonlinear\nsusceptibility tensor satisfies all symmetry and permutation properties, and\ncan be applied to all three-wave mixing processes. We obtain useful analytic\nexpressions in the limit of a degenerate electron distribution, which reveal\nquite strong second-order nonlinearity at long wavelengths, Fermi-edge\nresonances, and unusual polarization properties.\n", "  A current issue in the study of planetary nebulae with close binary central\nstars is the extent to which the binaries affect the shaping of the nebulae.\nRecent studies have begun to show a high coincidence rate between nebulae with\nlarge-scale axial or point symmetries and close binary stars. In addition,\ncombined binary-star and spatio-kinematic modeling of the nebulae have\ndemonstrated that all of the systems studied to date appear to have their\ncentral binary axis aligned with the primary axis of the nebula. Here we add\ntwo more systems to the list, the central stars and nebulae of NGC 6337 and Sp\n1. We show both systems to be low inclination, with their binary axis nearly\naligned with our line-of-sight. Their inclinations match published values for\nthe inclinations of their surrounding nebulae. Including these two systems with\nthe existing sample statistically demonstrates a direct link between the\ncentral binary and the nebular morphology. In addition to the systems'\ninclinations we give ranges for other orbital parameters from binary modeling,\nincluding updated orbital periods for the binary central stars of NGC 6337 and\nSp 1.\n", "  Based on the largest catalogs currently available, comprising 6090 contact\nbinaries (CBs) and 2167 open clusters, we determine the near-infrared $JHK_{\\rm\ns}$ CB period--luminosity (PL) relations, for the first time achieving the low\nlevels of intrinsic scatter that make these relations viable as competitive\ndistance calibrators. To firmly establish our distance calibration on the basis\nof open cluster CBs, we require that (i) the CB of interest must be located\ninside the core radius of its host cluster; (ii) the CB's proper motion must be\nlocated within the $2\\sigma$ distribution of that of its host open cluster; and\n(iii) the CB's age, $t$, must be comparable to that of its host cluster, i.e.,\n$\\Delta \\log (t\\mbox{ yr}^{-1}) <0.3$. We thus select a calibration sample of\n66 CBs with either open cluster distances or accurate space-based parallaxes.\nThe resulting near-infrared PL relations, for both late-type (i.e., W Ursae\nMajoris-type) and---for the first time---early-type CBs, are as accurate as the\nwell-established $JHK_{\\rm s}$ Cepheid PL relations, (characterized by\nsingle-band statistical uncertainties of $\\sigma < 0.10$ mag). We show that CBs\ncan be used as viable distance tracers, yielding distances with uncertainties\nof better than 5\\% for 90\\% of the 6090 CBs in our full sample. By combining\nthe full $JHK_{\\rm s}$ photometric data set, CBs can trace distances with an\naccuracy, $\\sigma=0.05 \\mbox{ (statistical)} \\pm0.03 \\mbox{ (systematic)}$ mag.\nThe 102 CBs in the Large Magellanic Cloud are used to determine a distance\nmodulus to the galaxy of $(m-M_V)_0^{\\rm LMC}=18.41\\pm0.20$ mag.\n", "  Infrared-Faint Radio Sources (IFRS) represent an unexpected class of objects\nrelatively bright at radio wavelength, but unusually faint at infrared (IR) and\noptical wavelengths. A recent and extensive campaign on the radio-brightest\nIFRSs (S_{1.4GHz} >= 10 mJy) has provided evidence that most of them (if not\nall) contain an AGN. Still uncertain is the nature of the radio-faintest ones\n(S_{1.4GHz} <= 1 mJy). The scope of this paper is to assess the nature of the\nradio-faintest IFRSs, testing their classification and improving the knowledge\nof their IR properties making use of the most sensitive IR survey available so\nfar: the Spitzer Extragalactic Representative Volume Survey (SERVS). We also\nexplore how the criteria of IFRSs can be fine-tuned to pinpoint radio-loud AGNs\nat very high redshift (z > 4). We analysed a number of IFRS samples identified\nin SERVS fields, including a new sample (21 sources) extracted from the Lockman\nHole. 3.6 and 4.5 mum IR counterparts of the 64 sources located in the SERVS\nfields were searched for, and, when detected, their IR properties were studied.\nWe compared the radio/IR properties of the IR-detected IFRSs with those\nexpected for a number of known classes of objects. We found that they are\nmostly consistent with a mixture of high-redshift (z >= 3) radio-loud AGNs. The\nfaintest ones (S_{1.4GHz} ~ 100 muJy), however, could be also associated with\nnearer (z ~ 2) dust-enshrouded star-burst galaxies. We also argue that, while\nIFRSs with radio-to-IR ratios > 500 can very efficiently pinpoint radio-loud\nAGNs at redshift 2 < z < 4, lower radio-to-IR ratios (~ 100--200) are expected\nfor higher redshift radio-loud AGNs.\n", "  We propose a general numerical method to study the Casimir effect in lattice\ngauge theories. We illustrate the method by calculating the energy density of\nzero-point fluctuations around two parallel wires of finite static permittivity\nin Abelian gauge theory in two spatial dimensions. We discuss various subtle\nissues related to the lattice formulation of the problem and show how they can\nsuccessfully be resolved. Finally, we calculate the Casimir potential between\nthe wires of a fixed permittivity, extrapolate our results to the limit of\nideally conducting wires and demonstrate excellent agreement with a known\ntheoretical result.\n", "  Extensive photometric and spectroscopic observations are presented for SN\n2014cx, a type IIP supernova (SN) exploding in the nearby galaxy NGC 337. The\nobservations are performed in optical and ultraviolet bands, covering from -20\nto +400 days from the peak light. The stringent detection limit from\nprediscovery images suggests that this supernova was actually detected within\nabout 1 day after explosion. Evolution of the very early-time light curve of SN\n2014cx is similar to that predicted from a shock breakout and post-shock\ncooling decline before reaching the optical peak. Our photometric observations\nshow that SN 2014cx has a plateau duration of ~ 100 days, an absolute V-band\nmagnitude of ~ -16.5 mag at t~50 days, and a nickel mass of 0.056+-0.008 Msun.\nThe spectral evolution of SN 2014cx resembles that of normal SNe IIP like SN\n1999em and SN 2004et, except that it has a slightly higher expansion velocity\n(~ 4200 km/s at 50 days). From the cooling curve of photospheric temperature,\nwe derive that the progenitor has a pre-explosion radius of ~ 640 Rsun,\nconsistent with those obtained from SNEC modeling (~ 620 Rsun) and\nhydrodynamical modeling of the observables (~ 570 Rsun). Moreover, the\nhydrodynamical simulations yield a total explosion energy of ~ 0.4*10e51 erg,\nand an ejected mass of ~ 8 Msun. These results indicate that the immediate\nprogenitor of SN 2014cx is likely a red supergiant star with a mass of ~ 10\nMsun.\n", "  Extragalactic radio sources have been classified into two classes,\nFanaroff-Riley I and II, which differ in morphology and radio power. Strongly\nemitting sources belong to the edge-brightened FR II class, and weakly emitting\nsources to the edge-darkened FR I class. The origin of this dichotomy is not\nyet fully understood. Numerical simulations are successful in generating FR II\nmorphologies, but they fail to reproduce the diffuse structure of FR Is.\n  By means of hydro-dynamical 3D simulations of supersonic jets, we investigate\nhow the displayed morphologies depend on the jet parameters. Bow shocks and\nMach disks at the jet head, which are probably responsible for the hot spots in\nthe FR II sources, disappear for a jet kinetic power L_kin < 10^43 erg/s. This\nthreshold compares favorably with the luminosity at which the FR I/FR II\ntransition is observed.\n  The problem is addressed by numerical means carrying out 3D HD simulations of\nsupersonic jets that propagate in a non-homogeneous medium with the ambient\ntemperature that increases with distance from the jet origin, which maintains\nconstant pressure.\n  The jet energy in the lower power sources, instead of being deposited at the\nterminal shock, is gradually dissipated by the turbulence. The jets spread out\nwhile propagating, and they smoothly decelerate while mixing with the ambient\nmedium and produce the plumes characteristic of FR I objects.\n  Three-dimensionality is an essential ingredient to explore the FR I evolution\nbecause the properties of turbulence in two and three dimensions are very\ndifferent, since there is no energy cascade to small scales in two dimensions,\nand two-dimensional simulations with the same parameters lead to FRII-like\nbehavior.\n", "  We investigate the validity of the Dirac quantization condition (DQC) for\nmagnetic monopoles in noncommutative space-time. We use an approach based on an\nextension of the method introduced by Wu and Yang; the effects of\nnoncommutativity are analyzed using the Seiberg-Witten map and the\ncorresponding deformed Maxwell's equations are discussed. By means of a\nperturbation expansion in the noncommutativity parameter $\\theta$, we show\nfirst that the DQC remains unmodified up to the first and second order. This\nresult is then generalized to all orders in the expansion parameter for a class\nof noncommutative electric currents induced by the Seiberg-Witten map; these\ncurrents reduce to the Dirac delta function in the commutative limit.\n", "  We present fits to the broadband photometric spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) of 158 eclipsing binaries (EBs) in the Tycho-2 catalog. These EBs were\nselected because they have highly precise stellar radii, effective\ntemperatures, and in many cases metallicities previously determined in the\nliterature, and thus have bolometric luminosities that are typically good to\n$\\lesssim$ 10%. In most cases the available broadband photometry spans a\nwavelength range 0.4-10 $\\mu$m, and in many cases spans 0.15-22 $\\mu$m. The\nresulting SED fits, which have only extinction as a free parameter, provide a\nvirtually model-independent measure of the bolometric flux at Earth. The SED\nfits are satisfactory for 156 of the EBs, for which we achieve typical\nprecisions in the bolometric flux of $\\approx$ 3%. Combined with the accurately\nknown bolometric luminosity, the result for each EB is a predicted parallax\nthat is typically precise to $\\lesssim$ 5%. These predicted parallaxes---with\ntypical uncertainties of 200 $\\mu$as---are 4-5 times more precise than those\ndetermined by Hipparcos for 99 of the EBs in our sample, with which we find\nexcellent agreement. There is no evidence among this sample for significant\nsystematics in the Hipparcos parallaxes of the sort that notoriously afflicted\nthe Pleiades measurement. The EBs are distributed over the entire sky, span\nmore than 10 mag in brightness, reach distances of more than 5 kpc, and in many\ncases our predicted parallaxes should also be more precise than those expected\nfrom the Gaia first data release. The EBs studied here can thus serve as\nempirical, independent benchmarks for these upcoming fundamental parallax\nmeasurements.\n", "  We present the discovery of the transiting exoplanets HAT-P-65b and\nHAT-P-66b, with orbital periods of 2.6055 d and 2.9721 d, masses of $0.527 \\pm\n0.083$ M$_{J}$ and $0.783 \\pm 0.057$ M$_{J}$ and inflated radii of $1.89 \\pm\n0.13$ R$_{J}$ and $1.59^{+0.16}_{-0.10}$ R$_{J}$, respectively. They orbit\nmoderately bright ($V=13.145 \\pm 0.029$, and $V=12.993 \\pm 0.052$) stars of\nmass $1.212 \\pm 0.050$ M$_{\\odot}$ and $1.255^{+0.107}_{-0.054}$ M$_{\\odot}$.\nThe stars are at the main sequence turnoff. While it is well known that the\nradii of close-in giant planets are correlated with their equilibrium\ntemperatures, whether or not the radii of planets increase in time as their\nhosts evolve and become more luminous is an open question. Looking at the\nbroader sample of well-characterized close-in transiting giant planets, we find\nthat there is a statistically significant correlation between planetary radii\nand the fractional ages of their host stars, with a false alarm probability of\nonly 0.0041%. We find that the correlation between the radii of planets and the\nfractional ages of their hosts is fully explained by the known correlation\nbetween planetary radii and their present day equilibrium temperatures, however\nif the zero-age main sequence equilibrium temperature is used in place of the\npresent day equilibrium temperature then a correlation with age must also be\nincluded to explain the planetary radii. This suggests that, after contracting\nduring the pre-main-sequence, close-in giant planets are re-inflated over time\ndue to the increasing level of irradiation received from their host stars.\nPrior theoretical work indicates that such a dynamic response to irradiation\nrequires a significant fraction of the incident energy to be deposited deep\nwithin the planetary interiors.\n", "  The two-color above-threshold ionization (ATI) of atoms and ions is\ninvestigated for a vortex Bessel beam in the presence of a strong near-infrared\n(NIR) light field. While the photoionization is caused by the photons from the\nweak but extreme ultra-violet (XUV) vortex Bessel beam, the energy and angular\ndistribution of the photoelectrons and their sideband structure are affected by\nthe plane-wave NIR field. We here explore the energy spectra and angular\nemission of the photoelectrons in such two-color fields as a function of the\nsize and location of the target (atoms) with regard to the beam axis. In\naddition, analogue to the circular dichroism in typical two-color ATI\nexperiments with circularly polarized light, we define and discuss seven\ndifferent dichroism signals for such vortex Bessel beams that arise from the\nvarious combinations of the orbital and spin angular momenta of the two light\nfields. For localized targets, it is found that these dichroism signals\nstrongly depend on the size and position of the atoms relative to the beam. For\nmacroscopically extended targets, in contrast, three of these dichroism signals\ntend to zero, while the other four just coincide with the (standard) circular\ndichroism, similar as for Bessel beams with small opening angle. Detailed\ncomputations of the dichroism are performed and discussed for the $4s$\nvalence-shell photoionization of Ca$^+$ ions.\n", "  Air-Cherenkov telescopes have mapped the Galactic plane at TeV energies. Here\nwe evaluate the prospects for detecting the neutrino emission from sources in\nthe Galactic plane assuming that the highest energy photons originate from the\ndecay of pions, which yields a straightforward prediction for the neutrino flux\nfrom the decay of the associated production of charged pions. Four promising\nsources are identified based on having a large flux and a flat spectrum. We\nsubsequently evaluate the probability of their identification above the\natmospheric neutrino background in IceCube data as a function of time. We show\nthat observing them over the twenty-year lifetime of the instrumentation is\nlikely, and that some should be observable at the $3\\,\\sigma$ level with six\nyears of data. In the absence of positive results, we derive constraints on the\nspectral index and cut-off energy of the sources, assuming a hadronic\nacceleration mechanism.\n", "  We present a parity-doublet theorem for the representation of the intrinsic\nparity of Majorana fermions, which is expected to be useful also in condensed\nmatter physics, and it is illustrated to provide a criterion of\nneutron-antineutron oscillation in a BCS-like effective theory with $\\Delta\nB=2$ baryon number violating terms. The CP violation in the present effective\ntheory causes no direct CP violating effects in the oscillation itself, which\nis demonstrated by the exact solution, although it influences the neutron\nelectric dipole moment in the leading order of small $\\Delta B=2$ parameters.\nAn analogue of Bogoliubov transformation, which preserves P and CP, is crucial\nin the analysis.\n", "  In this contribution I will discuss fundamental stellar parameters as\ndetermined from young star clusters; specifically those with ages less than or\napproximately equal to that of the Pleiades. I will focus primarily on the use\nof stellar evolutionary models to determine the ages and masses of stars, as\nwell as discuss the limitations of such models using a combination of both\nyoung clusters and eclipsing binary systems. In addition, I will also highlight\na few interesting recent results from large on-going spectroscopic surveys\n(specifically Gaia-ESO and APOGEE/IN-SYNC) which are continuing to challenge\nour understanding of the formation and early evolutionary stages of young\nclusters.\n", "  We investigate the chemical composition of the solar system's giant planets\natmospheres using a physical formation model with chemistry. The model\nincorporate disk evolution, pebbles and gas accretion, type I and II migration,\nsimplified disk photoevaporation and solar system chemical measurements. We\ntrack the chemical compositions of the formed giant planets and compare them to\nthe observed values. Two categories of models are studied: with and without\ndisk chemical enrichment via photoevaporation. Predictions for the Oxygen and\nNitrogen abundances, core masses, and total amount of heavy elements for the\nplanets are made for each case. We find that in the case without disk PE, both\nJupiter and Saturn will have a small residual core and comparable total amounts\nof heavy elements in the envelopes. We predict oxygen abundances enrichments in\nthe same order as carbon, phosphorus and sulfur for both planets. Cometary\nNitrogen abundances does not allow to easily reproduce Jupiter's nitrogen\nobservations. In the case with disk PE, less core erosion is needed to\nreproduce the chemical composition of the atmospheres, so both planets will end\nup with possibly more massive residual cores, and higher total mass of heavy\nelements. It is also significantly easier to reproduce Jupiter's Nitrogen\nabundance. No single was disk was found to form both Jupiter and Saturn with\nall their constraints in the case without photoevaporation. No model was able\nto fit the constraints on Uranus & Neptune, hinting toward a more complicated\nformation mechanism for these planets. The predictions of these models should\nbe compared to the upcoming Juno measurements to better understand the origins\nof the solar system giant planets.\n", "  We present a detailed investigation of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) disk\nusing classical Cepheids. Our analysis is based on optical (I,V; OGLE-IV),\nnear-infrared (NIR: J,H,Ks) and mid-infrared (MIR: w1; WISE) mean magnitudes.\nBy adopting new templates to estimate the NIR mean magnitudes from single-epoch\nmeasurements, we build the currently most accurate, largest and homogeneous\nmulti-band dataset of LMC Cepheids. We determine Cepheid individual distances\nusing optical and NIR Period-Wesenheit relations (PWRs), to measure the\ngeometry of the LMC disk and its viewing angles. Cepheid distances based on\noptical PWRs are precise at 3%, but accurate to 7, while the ones based on NIR\nPWRs are more accurate (to 3%), but less precise (2%-15%), given the higher\nphotometric error on the observed magnitudes. We found an inclination i=25.05\n$\\pm$ 0.02 (stat.) $\\pm$ 0.55 (syst.) deg, and a position angle of the lines of\nnodes P.A.=150.76 $\\pm$ 0.02(stat.) $\\pm$ 0.07(syst.) deg. These values agree\nwell with estimates based either on young (Red Supergiants) or on\nintermediate-age (Asymptotic Giant Branch, Red Clump) stellar tracers, but they\nsignificantly differ from evaluations based on old (RR Lyrae) stellar tracers.\nThis indicates that young/intermediate and old stellar populations have\ndifferent spatial distributions. Finally, by using the reddening-law fitting\napproach, we provide a reddening map of the LMC disk which is ten times more\naccurate and two times larger than similar maps in the literature. We also\nfound an LMC true distance modulus of $\\mu_{0,LMC}=18.48 \\pm 0.10$ (stat. and\nsyst.) mag, in excellent agreement with the currently most accurate measurement\n(Pietrzynski et al. 2013).\n", "  We derive the complete set of geodesic equations for massive and massless\ntest particles of a five-dimensional, charged, rotating black hole solution of\nthe Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons field equations in five-dimensional minimal\ngauged supergravity and present their analytical solutions in terms of\nWeierstra{\\ss}' elliptic functions. We study the polar and radial motion,\ndepending on the black hole and test particle parameters, and characterize the\ntest particle motion qualitatively by the means of effective potentials. We use\nthe analytical solutions in order to visualize the test particle motion by two-\nand three-dimensional plots.\n", "  Although there has been much progress in understanding how galaxies evolve,\nwe still do not understand how and when they stop forming stars and become\nquiescent. We address this by applying our galaxy spectral energy distribution\nmodels, which incorporate physically motivated star formation histories (SFHs)\nfrom cosmological simulations, to a sample of quiescent galaxies at\n$0.2<z<2.1$. A total of 845 quiescent galaxies with multi-band photometry\nspanning rest-frame ultraviolet through near-infrared wavelengths are selected\nfrom the CANDELS dataset. We compute median SFHs of these galaxies in bins of\nstellar mass and redshift. At all redshifts and stellar masses, the median SFHs\nrise, reach a peak, and then decline to reach quiescence. At high redshift, we\nfind that the rise and decline are fast, as expected because the Universe is\nyoung. At low redshift, the duration of these phases depends strongly on\nstellar mass. Low-mass galaxies ($\\log(M_{\\ast}/M_{\\odot})\\sim9.5$) grow on\naverage slowly, take a long time to reach their peak of star formation\n($\\gtrsim 4$ Gyr), and the declining phase is fast ($\\lesssim 2$ Gyr).\nConversely, high-mass galaxies ($\\log(M_{\\ast}/M_{\\odot})\\sim11$) grow on\naverage fast ($\\lesssim 2$ Gyr), and, after reaching their peak, decrease the\nstar formation slowly ($\\gtrsim 3$ Gyr). These findings are consistent with\ngalaxy stellar mass being a driving factor in determining how evolved galaxies\nare, with high-mass galaxies being the most evolved at any time (i.e.,\ndownsizing). The different durations we observe in the declining phases also\nsuggest that low- and high-mass galaxies experience different quenching\nmechanisms that operate on different timescales.\n", "  Aims. Although the temporal evolution of active regions (ARs) is relatively\nwell understood, the processes involved continue to be the subject of\ninvestigation. We study how the magnetic field of a series of ARs evolves with\ntime to better characterise how ARs emerge and disperse. Methods. We examine\nthe temporal variation in the magnetic field distribution of 37 emerging ARs. A\nkernel density estimation plot of the field distribution was created on a\nlog-log scale for each AR at each time step. We found that the central portion\nof the distribution is typically linear and its slope was used to characterise\nthe evolution of the magnetic field. Results. The slopes were seen to evolve\nwith time, becoming less steep as the fragmented emerging flux coalesces. The\nslopes reached a maximum value of ~ -1.5 just before the time of maximum flux\nbefore becoming steeper during the decay phase towards the quiet Sun value of ~\n-3. This behaviour differs significantly from a classical diffusion model,\nwhich produces a slope of -1. These results suggest that simple classical\ndiffusion is not responsible for the observed changes in field distribution,\nbut that other processes play a significant role in flux dispersion.\nConclusions. We propose that the steep negative slope seen during the late\ndecay phase is due to magnetic flux reprocessing by (super)granular convective\ncells.\n", "  We provide analytical results for the $O(\\alpha_s)$ corrections to the\ndouble-spin density matrix elements in the reaction $e^+e^-\\to t\\bar t$. These\nconcern the elements $ll$, $lt$, $ln$, $tt$, $tn$, and $nn$ of the double-spin\ndensity matrix elements where $l,t,n$ stand for longitudinal, transverse and\nnormal orientations with respect to the beam frame spanned by the electron and\nthe top quark momentum.\n", "  We study scalar and chiral fermionic models in next-to-leading order with the\nhelp of the functional renormalisation group. Their critical behaviour is of\nspecial interest in condensed matter systems, in particular graphene. To derive\nthe beta functions, we make extensive use of computer algebra. The resulting\nflow equations were solved with pseudo-spectral methods to guarantee high\naccuracy. New estimates on critical quantities for both the Ising and the\nGross-Neveu model are provided. For the Ising model, the estimates agree with\nearlier renormalisation group studies of the same level of approximation. By\ncontrast, the approximation for the Gross-Neveu model retains many more\noperators than all earlier studies. For two Dirac fermions, the results agree\nwith both lattice and large-$N_f$ calculations, but for a single flavour,\ndifferent methods disagree quantitatively, and further studies are necessary.\n", "  The brightest southern quasar above redshift $z=1$, HE 0515$-$4414, with its\nstrong intervening metal absorption-line system at $z_{abs}=1.1508$, provides a\nunique opportunity to precisely measure or limit relative variations in the\nfine-structure constant ($\\Delta\\alpha/\\alpha$). A variation of just $\\sim$3\nparts per million (ppm) would produce detectable velocity shifts between its\nmany strong metal transitions. Using new and archival observations from the\nUltraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) we obtain an extremely high\nsignal-to-noise ratio spectrum (peaking at S/N $\\approx250$ pix$^{-1}$). This\nprovides the most precise measurement of $\\Delta\\alpha/\\alpha$ from a single\nabsorption system to date, $\\Delta\\alpha/\\alpha=-1.42\\pm0.55_{\\rm\nstat}\\pm0.65_{\\rm sys}$ ppm, comparable with the precision from previous, large\nsamples of $\\sim$150 absorbers. The largest systematic error in all (but one)\nprevious similar measurements, including the large samples, was long-range\ndistortions in the wavelength calibration. These would add a $\\sim$2 ppm\nsystematic error to our measurement and up to $\\sim$10 ppm to other\nmeasurements using Mg and Fe transitions. However, we corrected the UVES\nspectra using well-calibrated spectra of the same quasar from the High Accuracy\nRadial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS), leaving a residual 0.59 ppm systematic\nuncertainty, the largest contribution to our total systematic error. A similar\napproach, using short observations on future, well-calibrated spectrographs to\ncorrect existing, high S/N spectra, would efficiently enable a large sample of\nreliable $\\Delta\\alpha/\\alpha$ measurements. The high S/N UVES spectrum also\nprovides insights into analysis difficulties, detector artifacts and systematic\nerrors likely to arise from 25-40-m telescopes.\n", "  We present FORS2 (attached to ESO's Very Large Telescope) observations of the\nexoplanet WASP-17b during its primary transit, for the purpose of differential\nspectrophotometry analysis. We use the instrument in its Mask eXchange Unit\n(MXU) mode to simultaneously obtain low resolution spectra of the planet\nhosting star, as well as several reference stars in the field of view. The\nintegration of these spectra within broadband and smaller 100$\\AA$ bins\nprovides us with 'white' and spectrophotometric light curves, from 5700 to\n8000$\\AA$. Through modelling the white light curve, we obtain refined bulk and\ntransit parameters of the planet, as well as wavelength-dependent variations of\nthe planetary radius from smaller spectral bins through which the transmission\nspectrum is obtained. The inference of transit parameters, as well as the noise\nstatistics, is performed using a Gaussian Process model. We achieve a typical\nprecision in the transit depth of a few hundred parts per million from various\ntransit light curves. From the transmission spectra we rule out a flat spectrum\nat >3$\\sigma$ and detect marginal presence of the pressure-broadened sodium\nwings. Furthermore, we detect the wing of the potassium absorption line in the\nupper atmosphere of the planet with 3$\\sigma$ confidence, both facts pointing\nto a relatively shallow temperature gradient of the atmosphere. These\nconclusions are mostly consistent with previous studies of this exo-atmosphere,\nalthough previous potassium measurements have been inconclusive.\n", "  The purported spiral host galaxy of GRB 020819B at z=0.41 has been seminal in\nestablishing our view of the diversity of long-duration gamma-ray burst\nenvironments: optical spectroscopy of this host provided evidence that GRBs can\nform even at high metallicities, while millimetric observations suggested that\nGRBs may preferentially form in regions with minimal molecular gas. We report\nnew observations from VLT (MUSE and X-shooter) which demonstrate that the\npurported host is an unrelated foreground galaxy. The probable radio afterglow\nis coincident with a compact, highly star-forming, dusty galaxy at z=1.9621.\nThe revised redshift naturally explains the apparent nondetection of CO(3-2)\nline emission at the afterglow site from ALMA. There is no evidence that\nmolecular gas properties in GRB host galaxies are unusual, and limited evidence\nthat GRBs can form readily at super-Solar metallicity.\n", "  We present the first robust detection of HI 21 cm emission in the blue\ncompact galaxy Haro 11 using the 100m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope\n(GBT). Haro 11 is a luminous blue compact galaxy with emission in both Lyman\nAlpha and the Lyman continuum. We detect (5.1 $\\pm$ 0.7 $\\times$10$^8$)\nM$_{\\odot}$ of HI gas at an assumed distance of 88 Mpc, making this galaxy HI\ndeficient compared to other local galaxies with similar optical properties.\nGiven this small HI mass, Haro 11 has an elevated M$_{H2}$/M$_{HI}$ ratio and a\nvery low gas fraction compared to most local galaxies, and contains twice as\nmuch mass in ionized hydrogen as in neutral hydrogen. The HI emission has a\nlinewidth of 71 kms$^{-1}$ and is offset 60 kms$^{-1}$ redward of the optical\nline center. It is undergoing a starburst after a recent merger which has\nelevated the star formation rate, and will deplete the gas supply in $<$ 0.2\nGyr. Although this starburst has elevated the SFR compared to galaxies with\nsimilar HI masses and linewidths, Haro 11 matches a trend of lower gas\nfractions toward higher star formation rates and is below the general trend of\nincreasing HI mass with increasing luminosity. Taken together, our results\npaint Haro 11 as a standard low-mass galaxy that is undergoing an unusually\nefficient star formation episode.\n", "  We study Kondo screening obtained by coupling Majorana bound states, located\non a topological superconducting island, to interacting electronic reservoirs.\nAt the charge degeneracy points of the island, we formulate an exact mapping\nonto the spin-$1/2$ multi-channel Kondo effect. The coupling to Majorana\nfermions transforms the tunneling terms into effective fermionic bilinear\ncontributions with a Luttinger parameter $K$ in the leads that is effectively\ndoubled. For strong interaction, $K=1/2$, the intermediate fixed point of the\nstandard multi-channel Kondo model is exactly recovered. It evolves with $K$\nand connects to strong coupling in non-interacting case $K=1$, with maximum\nconductance between the leads and robustness against channel asymmetries\nsimilarly to the topological Kondo effect. For a number of leads above four,\nthere exists a window of Luttinger parameters in which a quantum phase\ntransition can occur between the strong coupling topological Kondo state and\nthe partially conducting multi-channel Kondo state.\n", "  We use the Gaia data release 1 (DR1) to study the proper motion (PM) fields\nof the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC). This uses the Tycho-Gaia\nAstrometric Solution (TGAS) PMs for 29 Hipparcos stars in the LMC and 8 in the\nSMC. The LMC PM in the West and North directions is inferred to be\n$(\\mu_W,\\mu_N) = (-1.872 \\pm 0.045, 0.224 \\pm 0.054)$ mas/yr, and the SMC PM\n$(\\mu_W,\\mu_N) = (-0.874 \\pm 0.066, -1.229 \\pm 0.047)$ mas/yr. These results\nhave similar accuracy and agree to within the uncertainties with existing\nHubble Space Telescope (HST) PM measurements. Since TGAS uses different methods\nwith different systematics, this provides an external validation of both data\nsets and their underlying approaches. Residual DR1 systematics may affect the\nTGAS results, but the HST agreement implies this must be below the random\nerrors. Also in agreement with prior HST studies, the TGAS LMC PM field clearly\nshows the clockwise rotation of the disk, even though it takes the LMC disk in\nexcess of $10^8$ years to complete one revolution. The implied rotation curve\namplitude for young LMC stars is consistent with that inferred from\nline-of-sight (LOS) velocity measurements. Comparison of the PM and LOS\nrotation curves implies a kinematic LMC distance modulus $m-M = 18.54 \\pm\n0.39$, consistent but not yet competitive with photometric methods. These first\nresults from Gaia on the topic of Local Group dynamics provide an indication of\nhow its future data releases will revolutionize this field.\n", "  We present photometry and time-series spectroscopy of the nearby type Ia\nsupernova (SN Ia) SN 2015F over $-16$ days to $+80$ days relative to maximum\nlight, obtained as part of the Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient\nObjects (PESSTO). SN 2015F is a slightly sub-luminous SN Ia with a decline rate\nof $\\Delta m15(B)=1.35 \\pm 0.03$ mag, placing it in the region between normal\nand SN 1991bg-like events. Our densely-sampled photometric data place tight\nconstraints on the epoch of first light and form of the early-time light curve.\nThe spectra exhibit photospheric C II $\\lambda 6580$ absorption until $-4$\ndays, and high-velocity Ca II is particularly strong at $<-10$ days at\nexpansion velocities of $\\simeq$23000\\kms. At early times, our spectral\nmodelling with syn++ shows strong evidence for iron-peak elements (Fe II, Cr\nII, Ti II, and V II) expanding at velocities $>14000$ km s$^{-1}$, suggesting\nmixing in the outermost layers of the SN ejecta. Although unusual in SN Ia\nspectra, including V II in the modelling significantly improves the spectral\nfits. Intriguingly, we detect an absorption feature at $\\sim$6800 \\AA\\ that\npersists until maximum light. Our favoured explanation for this line is\nphotospheric Al II, which has never been claimed before in SNe Ia, although\ndetached high-velocity C II material could also be responsible. In both cases\nthe absorbing material seems to be confined to a relatively narrow region in\nvelocity space. The nucleosynthesis of detectable amounts of Al II would argue\nagainst a low-metallicity white dwarf progenitor. We also show that this 6800\n\\AA\\ feature is weakly present in other normal SN Ia events, and common in the\nSN 1991bg-like sub-class.\n", "  We study the influence of inelastic electron-electron scattering on the\ntemperature variation of the Seebeck coefficient in the normal phase of\nquasi-one-dimensional organic superconductors. The theory is based on the\nnumerical solution of the semi-classical Boltzmann equation for which the\ncollision integral equation is solved with the aid of the electronic umklapp\nscattering vertex calculated by the renormalization group method. We show that\nthe one-loop renormalization group flow of momentum and temperature dependent\numklapp scattering, in the presence of nesting alterations of the Fermi\nsurface, introduce electron-hole asymmetry in the energy dependence of the\nanisotropic scattering time. This is responsible for the enhancement of the\nSeebeck coefficient with respect to the band $T$-linear prediction and even its\nsign reversal around the quantum critical point of the phase diagram, namely\nwhere the interplay between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity along with\nthe strength of spin fluctuations are the strongest. Comparison of the results\nwith available data on low dimensional organic superconductors is presented and\ncritically discussed.\n", "  Stellar activity influences radial velocity (RV) measurements and can also\nmimic the presence of orbiting planets. As part of the search for planets\naround the components of wide binaries performed with the SARG High Resolution\nSpectrograph at the TNG, it was discovered that HD 200466A shows strong\nvariation in RV that is well correlated with the activity index based on\nH$_\\alpha$. We used SARG to study the H$_\\alpha$ line variations in each\ncomponent of the binaries and a few bright stars to test the capability of the\nH$_\\alpha$ index of revealing the rotation period or activity cycle. We also\nanalysed the relations between the average activity level and other physical\nproperties of the stars. We finally tried to reveal signals in the RVs that are\ndue to the activity. At least in some cases the variation in the observed RVs\nis due to the stellar activity. We confirm that H$_\\alpha$ can be used as an\nactivity indicator for solar-type stars and as an age indicator for stars\nyounger than 1.5 Gyr.\n", "  For the general Two-Higgs-Doublet model, we present conditions for having\nspontaneous CP violation, in terms of physical masses and couplings. These\nrelations involve the charged-Higgs mass, its cubic couplings with neutral\nscalars and quartic coupling, and become particularly simple in the alignment\nlimit. In the simplified model with softly broken $Z_2$ symmetry, some\ndeviation from alignment is required for spontaneous CP violation to be\npresent.\n", "  Among young binary stars whose magnetospheres are expected to collide, only\ntwo systems have been observed near periastron in the X-ray band: the low-mass\nDQ Tau and the older and more massive HD 152404. Both exhibit elevated levels\nof X-ray emission at periastron. Our goal is to determine whether colliding\nmagnetospheres in young high-eccentricity binaries commonly produce elevated\naverage levels of X-ray activity. This work is based on Chandra snapshots of\nmultiple periastron and non-periastron passages in four nearby young eccentric\nbinaries (Parenago 523, RX J1622.7-2325 Nw, UZ Tau E, and HD 152404). We find\nthat for the merged sample of all 4 binaries the current X-ray data show an\nincreasing average X-ray flux near periastron (at about 2.5-sigma level).\nFurther comparison of these data with the X-ray properties of hundreds of young\nstars in the Orion Nebula Cluster, produced by the Chandra Orion Ultradeep\nProject (COUP), indicates that the X-ray emission from the merged sample of our\nbinaries can not be explained within the framework of the COUP-like X-ray\nactivity. However, due to the inhomogeneities of the merged binary sample and\nthe relatively low statistical significance of the detected flux increase,\nthese findings are regarded as tentative only. More data are needed to prove\nthat the flux increase is real and is related to the processes of colliding\nmagnetospheres.\n", "  We explore whether close-in super-Earths were formed as rocky bodies that\nfailed to grow fast enough to become the cores of gas giants before the natal\nprotostellar disk dispersed. We model the failed cores' inward orbital\nmigration in the low-mass or type I regime, to stopping points at distances\nwhere the tidal interaction with the protostellar disk applies zero net torque.\nThe three kinds of migration traps considered are those due to the dead zone's\nouter edge, the ice line, and the transition from accretion to starlight as the\ndisk's main heat source. As the disk disperses, the traps move toward final\npositions near or just outside 1~au. Planets at this location exceeding about\n3~M$_\\oplus$ open a gap, decouple from their host trap, and migrate inward in\nthe high-mass or type II regime to reach the vicinity of the star. We\nsynthesize the population of planets formed in this scenario, finding that some\nfraction of the observed super-Earths can be failed cores. Most super-Earths\nformed this way have more than 4~M$_\\oplus$, so their orbits when the disk\ndisperses are governed by type II migration. These planets have solid cores\nsurrounded by gaseous envelopes. Their subsequent photoevaporative mass loss is\nmost effective for masses originally below about 6 M$_\\oplus$. The failed core\nscenario suggests a division of the observed super-Earth mass-radius diagram\ninto five zones according to the inferred formation history.\n", "  The Milky Way (MW) and M31 both harbor massive satellite galaxies, the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC) and M33, which may comprise up to 10 per cent of their\nhost's total mass. Massive satellites can change the orbital barycentre of the\nhost-satellite system by tens of kiloparsecs and are cosmologically expected to\nharbor dwarf satellite galaxies of their own. Assessing the impact of these\neffects depends crucially on the orbital histories of the LMC and M33. Here, we\nrevisit the dynamics of the MW-LMC system and present the first detailed\nanalysis of the M31-M33 system utilizing high precision proper motions and\nstatistics from the dark matter-only Illustris cosmological simulation. With\nthe latest Hubble Space Telescope proper motion measurements of M31, we\nreliably constrain M33's interaction history with its host. In particular, like\nthe LMC, M33 is either on its first passage (t_{inf} < 2 Gyr ago) or if M31 is\nmassive (>=2x10^12 Msun), it is on a long period orbit of about 6 Gyr.\nCosmological analogs of the LMC and M33 identified in Illustris support this\npicture and provide further insight about their host masses. We conclude that,\ncosmologically, massive satellites like the LMC and M33 are likely completing\ntheir first orbits about their hosts. We also find that the orbital energies of\nsuch analogs prefer a MW halo mass ~1.5x10^12 Msun and an M31 halo mass\n>=1.5x10^12 Msun. Despite conventional wisdom, we conclude it is highly\nimprobable that M33 made a close (< 100 kpc) approach to M31 recently (\nt_{peri} < 3 Gyr ago). Such orbits are rare (< 1 per cent) within the 4$\\sigma$\nerror space allowed by observations. This conclusion cannot be explained by\nperturbative effects through four body encounters between the MW, M31, M33, and\nthe LMC. This surprising result implies that we must search for a new\nexplanation for M33's strongly warped gas and stellar discs.\n", "  We use the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey (SDSS) to confirm a connection between dust-obscured active galactic\nnuclei (AGNs) and galaxy merging. Using a new, volume-limited (z <= 0.08)\ncatalog of visually-selected major mergers and galaxy-galaxy interactions from\nthe SDSS, with stellar masses above 2x10^10 Msun, we find that major mergers\n(interactions) are 5-17 (3-5) times more likely to have red [3.4]-[4.6] colors\nassociated with dust-obscured or `dusty' AGNs, compared to non-merging galaxies\nwith similar masses. Using published fiber spectral diagnostics, we map the\n[3.4]-[4.6] versus [4.6]-[12] colors of different emission-line galaxies and\nfind one-quarter of Seyferts have colors indicative of a dusty AGN. We find\nthat AGNs are five times more likely to be obscured when hosted by a merging\ngalaxy, half of AGNs hosted by a merger are dusty, and we find no enhanced\nfrequency of optical AGNs in merging over non-merging galaxies. We conclude\nthat undetected AGNs missed at shorter wavelengths are at the heart of the\nongoing AGN-merger connection debate. The vast majority of mergers hosting\ndusty AGNs are star-forming and located at the centers of Mhalo<10^13 Msun\ngroups. Assuming plausibly short duration dusty-AGN phases, we speculate that a\nlarge fraction of gas-rich mergers experience a brief obscured AGN phase, in\nagreement with the strong connection between central star formation and black\nhole growth seen in merger simulations.\n", "  New accurate and homogeneous optical UBVRI photometry has been obtained for\nvariable stars in the Galactic globular $\\omega$ Cen (NGC 5139). We secured\n8202 CCD images covering a time interval of 24 years and a sky area of 84x48\narcmin. The current data were complemented with data available in the\nliterature and provided new, homogeneous pulsation parameters (mean magnitudes,\nluminosity amplitudes,periods) for 187 candidate $\\omega$ Cen RR Lyrae (RRLs).\nAmong them we have 101 RRc (first overtone), 85 RRab (fundamental) and a single\ncandidate RRd (double-mode) variables. Candidate Blazhko RRLs show periods and\ncolors that are intermediate between RRc and RRab variables, suggesting that\nthey are transitional objects.\n  The comparison of the period distribution and of the Bailey diagram indicates\nthat RRLs in $\\omega$ Cen show a long-period tail not present in typical\nOosterhoff II (OoII) globulars. The RRLs in dwarf spheroidals and in ultra\nfaint dwarfs have properties between Oosterhoff intermediate and OoII clusters.\nMetallicity plays a key role in shaping the above evidence. These findings do\nnot support the hypothesis that $\\omega$ Cen is the core remnant of a spoiled\ndwarf galaxy.\n  Using optical Period-Wesenheit relations that are reddening-free and\nminimally dependent on metallicity we find a mean distance to $\\omega$ Cen of\n13.71$\\pm$0.08$\\pm$0.01 mag (semi-empirical and theoretical calibrations).\nFinally, we invert the I-band Period-Luminosity-Metallicity relation to\nestimate individual RRLs metal abundances. The metallicity distribution agrees\nquite well with spectroscopic and photometric metallicity estimates available\nin the literature.\n", "  The hyperfine spectra of $^{51,53-64}$Mn were measured in two experimental\nruns using collinear laser spectroscopy at ISOLDE, CERN. Laser spectroscopy was\nperformed on the atomic $3d^5\\ 4s^2\\ ^{6}\\text{S}_{5/2}\\rightarrow 3d^5\\ 4s4p\\\n^{6}\\text{P}_{3/2}$ and ionic $3d^5\\ 4s\\ ^{5}\\text{S}_2 \\rightarrow 3d^5\\ 4p\\\n^{5}\\text{P}_3$ transitions, yielding two sets of isotope shifts. The mass and\nfield shift factors for both transitions have been calculated in the\nmulticonfiguration Dirac-Fock framework and were combined with a King plot\nanalysis in order to obtain a consistent set of mean-square charge radii which,\ntogether with earlier work on neutron-deficient Mn, allow the study of nuclear\nstructure changes from $N=25$ across $N=28$ up to $N=39$. A clear development\nof deformation is observed towards $N=40$, confirming the conclusions of the\nnuclear moments studies. From a Monte Carlo Shell Model study of the shape in\nthe Mn isotopic chain, it is suggested that the observed development of\ndeformation is not only due to an increase in static prolate deformation but\nalso due to shape fluctuations and triaxiality. The changes in mean-square\ncharge radii are well reproduced using the Duflo-Zuker formula except in the\ncase of large deformation.\n", "  The ex-nova RR Pic presents a periodic hump in its light curve which is\nconsidered to refer to its orbital period. Analyzing all available epochs of\nthese hump maxima in the literature, and combining them with those from new\nlight curves obtained in 2013 and 2014, we establish an unique cycle count\nscheme valid during the past 50 years, and derive an ephemeris with the orbital\nperiod 0.145025959(15) days. The O - C diagram of this linear ephemeris reveals\nsystematic deviations which could have different causes. One of them could be a\nlight-travel-time effect caused by the presence of a hypothetical third body\nnear the star/brown dwarf mass limit, with an orbital period of the order of 70\nyears. We also examine the difficulty of the problematic of detecting\nsub-stellar or planetary companions of close red-dwarf white-dwarf binaries\n(including cataclysmic variables), and discuss other possible mechanisms\nresponsible for the observed deviations in O - C. For RR Pic, we propose\nstrategies in order to solve this question by new observations.\n", "  To elucidate the pseudogap phase diagram including the overdoped state of\nhigh transition temperature (high-$T_c$) cuprates, we must understand the\norigin of the positive out-of-plane magnetoconductivity (MC) observed in these\ncompounds. For this purpose, the out-of-plane resistivity $\\rho_c(T,H)$ of an\noverdoped Bi$_{1.6}$Pb$_{0.4}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{1.96}$Fe$_{0.04}$O$_{8+\\delta}$\n(Bi-2212) single crystal is measured under pulsed magnetic fields up to 60 T.\nWe show that the superconductive density-of-states (DOS) depletion effect, in\naddition to the pseudogap effect, clearly appears below the superconductive\nfluctuation regime, and the contribution becomes dominant in the\nsuperconducting state.\n", "  We analyze the relationships between atomic, neutral hydrogen (HI) and star\nformation (SF) in the 12 low-mass SHIELD galaxies. We compare high spectral\n(~0.82 km/s/channel) and spatial resolution (physical resolutions of 170 pc -\n700 pc) HI imaging from the VLA with H\\alpha and far-ultraviolet imaging. We\nquantify the degree of co-spatiality between star forming regions and regions\nof high HI column densities. We calculate the global star formation\nefficiencies (SFE, $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$ / $\\Sigma_{\\rm HI}$), and examine the\nrelationships among the SFE and HI mass, HI column density, and star formation\nrate (SFR). The systems are consuming their cold neutral gas on timescales of\norder a few Gyr. While we derive an index for the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation of\nN ~ 0.68 $\\pm$ 0.04 for the SHIELD sample as a whole, the values of N vary\nconsiderably from system to system. By supplementing SHIELD results with those\nfrom other surveys, we find that HI mass and UV-based SFR are strongly\ncorrelated over five orders of magnitude. Identification of patterns within the\nSHIELD sample allows us to bin the galaxies into three general categories: 1)\nmainly co-spatial HI and SF regions, found in systems with highest peak HI\ncolumn densities and highest total HI masses, 2) moderately correlated HI and\nSF regions, found in systems with moderate HI column densities, and 3) obvious\noffsets between HI and SF peaks, found in systems with the lowest total HI\nmasses. SF in these galaxies is dominated by stochasticity and random\nfluctuations in their ISM.\n", "  We present kinematic analyses of the 12 galaxies in the \"Survey of HI in\nExtremely Low-mass Dwarfs\" (SHIELD). We use multi-configuration interferometric\nobservations of the HI 21cm emission line from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large\nArray (VLA) to produce image cubes at a variety of spatial and spectral\nresolutions. Both two- and three-dimensional fitting techniques are employed in\nan attempt to derive inclination-corrected rotation curves for each galaxy. In\nmost cases, the comparable magnitudes of velocity dispersion and projected\nrotation result in degeneracies that prohibit unambiguous circular velocity\nsolutions. We thus make spatially resolved position-velocity cuts, corrected\nfor inclination using the stellar components, to estimate the circular rotation\nvelocities. We find circular velocities <30 km/s for the entire survey\npopulation. Baryonic masses are calculated using single-dish HI fluxes from\nArecibo and stellar masses derived from HST and Spitzer imaging. Comparison is\nmade with total dynamical masses estimated from the position-velocity analysis.\nThe SHIELD galaxies are then placed on the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation.\nThere exists an empirical threshold rotational velocity <15 km/s, below which\ncurrent observations cannot differentiate coherent rotation from pressure\nsupport. The SHIELD galaxies are representative of an important population of\ngalaxies whose properties cannot be described by current models of\nrotationally-dominated galaxy dynamics.\n", "  We apply the methodology developed in \\cite{Li2014,Li2015} to BOSS DR12\ngalaxies and derive cosmological constraints from the redshift dependence of\nthe Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect. The apparent anisotropy in the distribution\nof observed galaxies arise from two main sources, the redshift-space distortion\n(RSD) effect due to the galaxy peculiar velocities, and the geometric\ndistortion when incorrect cosmological models are assumed for transforming\nredshift to comoving distance, known as the AP effect. Anisotropies produced by\nthe RSD effect are, although large, maintaining a nearly uniform magnitude over\na large range of redshift, while the degree of anisotropies from the AP effect\nvaries with redshift by much larger magnitude. We split the DR12 galaxies into\nsix redshift bins, measure the 2-point correlation function in each bin, and\nassess the redshift evolution of anisotropies. We obtain constraints of\n$\\Omega_m=0.290 \\pm 0.053,\\ \\ w = -1.07 \\pm 0.15$, which are comparable with\nthe current constraints from other cosmological probes such as type Ia\nsupernovae, cosmic microwave background, and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO).\nCombining these cosmological probes with our method yield tight constraints of\n$ \\Omega_m = 0.301 \\pm 0.006,\\ w=-1.054 \\pm 0.025$. Our method is complementary\nto the other large scale structure probes like BAO and topology. We expect this\ntechnique will play an important role in deriving cosmological constraints from\nlarge scale structure surveys.\n", "  We study the phase space distributions of gluons inside a nucleon/nucleus in\nthe small-$x$ regime including the gluon saturation effect. This can be done by\nusing the relation between the gluon Wigner distribution and the dipole\nS-matrix at small-$x$, the latter satisfies the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK)\nequation. By efficiently solving the BK equation with impact parameter\ndependence, we compute the Wigner, Husimi and generalized TMD (GTMD)\ndistributions in the saturation regime. We also investigate the elliptic\nangular dependence of these distributions which has been recently shown to be\nmeasurable in DIS experiments.\n", "  We analyzed here the connection of superflares and the lithium abundance in G\nand K stars based on Li abundance determinations conducted with the echelle\nspectra of a full set of 280 stars obtained with the ELODIE spectrograph. For\nhigh-active stars we show a definite correlation between $\\log A(Li)$ and the\nchromosphere activity. We show that sets of stars with high Li abundance and\nhaving superflares possess common properties. It relates, firstly, to stars\nwith activity saturation. We consider the X-ray data for G, K, and M stars\nseparately, and show that transition from a saturation mode to solar-type\nactivity takes place at values of rotation periods 1.1, 3.3, and 7.2 days for\nG2, K4 and M3 spectral types, respectively. We discuss bimodal distribution of\na number of G and K main-sequence stars versus an axial rotation and location\nof superflare stars with respect to other Kepler stars. We conclude that\nsuperflare G and K stars are mainly fast rotating young objects, but some of\nthem belong to stars with solar-type activity. At the same time, we found a\ngroup of G stars with high Li content $(\\log A(Li) = 1.5 - 3)$, but being\nslower rotators with rotation periods > 10 days, which are characterized by low\nchromospheric activity. This agrees with a large spread in Li abundances in\nsuperflare stars. A mechanism leading to this effect is discussed.\n", "  We present new deep UBVRI images and high-resolution multi-object optical\nspectroscopy of the young (~ 6 - 10 Myr old), relatively nearby (800 pc) open\ncluster IC 2395. We identify nearly 300 cluster members and use the photometry\nto estimate their spectral types, which extend from early B to middle M. We\nalso present an infrared imaging survey of the central region using the IRAC\nand MIPS instruments on board the Spitzer Space Telescope, covering the\nwavelength range from 3.6 to 24 microns. Our infrared observations allow us to\ndetect dust in circumstellar disks originating over a typical range of radii ~\n0.1 to ~ 10AU from the central star. We identify 18 Class II, 8 transitional\ndisk, and 23 debris disk candidates, respectively 6.5%, 2.9%, and 8.3% of the\ncluster members with appropriate data. We apply the same criteria for\ntransitional disk identification to 19 other stellar clusters and associations\nspanning ages from ~ 1 to ~ 18 Myr. We find that the number of disks in the\ntransitional phase as a fraction of the total with strong 24 micron excesses\n([8] - [24] > 1.5) increases from 8.4 +\\- 1.3% at ~ 3 Myr to 46 +\\- 5% at ~ 10\nMyr. Alternative definitions of transitional disks will yield different\npercentages but should show the same trend.\n", "  The host star metallicity provide a measure of the conditions in\nprotoplanetary disks at the time of planet formation. Using a sample of over\n20,000 Kepler stars with spectroscopic metallicities from the LAMOST survey, we\nexplore how the exoplanet population depends on host star metallicity as a\nfunction of orbital period and planet size. We find that exoplanets with\norbital periods less than 10 days are preferentially found around metal-rich\nstars ([Fe/H]~ 0.15 +- 0.05 dex). The occurrence rates of these hot exoplanets\nincreases to ~30% for super-solar metallicity stars from ~10% for stars with a\nsub-solar metallicity. Cooler exoplanets, that resides at longer orbital\nperiods and constitute the bulk of the exoplanet population with an occurrence\nrate of >~ 90%, have host-star metallicities consistent with solar. At short\norbital periods, P<10 days, the difference in host star metallicity is largest\nfor hot rocky planets (<1.7 R_Earth), where the metallicity difference is\n[Fe/H] =~ 0.25 +- 0.07 dex. The excess of hot rocky planets around metal-rich\nstars implies they either share a formation mechanism with hot Jupiters, or\ntrace a planet trap at the protoplanetary disk inner edge which is\nmetallicity-dependent. We do not find statistically significant evidence for a\npreviously identified trend that small planets toward the habitable zone are\npreferentially found around low-metallicity stars. Refuting or confirming this\ntrend requires a larger sample of spectroscopic metallicities.\n", "  In an effort to further our interest in understanding basic chemistry of\ninterstellar molecules, we carry out here an extensive investigation of the\nstabilities of interstellar carbon chains; Cn, H2Cn, HCnN and CnX (X=N, O, Si,\nS, H, P, H-, N-). These sets of molecules accounts for about 20% of all the\nknown interstellar and circumstellar molecules, their high abundances therefore\ndemand a serious attention. High level ab initio quantum chemical calculations\nare employed to accurately estimate enthalpy of formation, chemical reactivity\nindices; global hardness and softness; and other chemical parameters of these\nmolecules. Chemical modeling of the abundances of these molecular species has\nalso been performed. Of the 89 molecules considered from these groups, 47 have\nbeen astronomically observed, these observed molecules are found to be more\nstable with respect to other members of the group. Of the 47 observed\nmolecules, 60% are odd number carbon chains. Interstellar chemistry is not\nactually driven by the thermodynamics, it is primarily dependent on various\nkinetic parameters. However, we found that the detectability of the odd\nnumbered carbon chains could be correlated due to the fact that they are more\nstable than the corresponding even numbered carbon chains. Based on this\naspect, the next possible carbon chain molecule for astronomical observation in\neach group is proposed. The effect of kinetics in the formation of some of\nthese carbon chain molecules is also discussed.\n", "  Ideal MHD provides an accurate description of low-frequency Alfv\\'en waves in\nfully ionized plasmas. However, higher frequency waves in many plasmas of the\nsolar atmosphere cannot be correctly described by ideal MHD and a more accurate\nmodel is required. Here, we study the properties of small-amplitude\nincompressible perturbations in both the low and the high frequency ranges in\nplasmas composed of several ionized species. We use a multi-fluid approach and\ntake into account the effects of collisions between ions and the inclusion of\nHall's term in the induction equation. Through the analysis of the\ncorresponding dispersion relations and numerical simulations we check that at\nhigh frequencies ions of different species are not as strongly coupled as in\nthe low frequency limit. Hence, they cannot be treated as a single fluid. In\naddition, elastic collisions between the distinct ionized species are not\nnegligible for high frequency waves since an appreciable damping is obtained.\nFurthermore, Coulomb collisions between ions remove the cyclotron resonances\nand the strict cut-off regions that are present when collisions are not taken\ninto account. The implications of these results for the modelling of\nhigh-frequency waves in solar plasmas are discussed.\n", "  Context. A lot of effort has been put into the detection and determination of\nstellar magnetic fields using the spectral signal obtained from the combination\nof hundreds or thousands of individual lines, an approach known as multi-line\ntechniques. However, so far most of multi-line techniques developed that\nretrieve stellar mean longitudinal magnetic fields recourse to sometimes heavy\nsimplifications concerning line shapes and Zeeman splittings.\n  Aims. To determine stellar longitudinal magnetic fields by means of the\nPrincipal Components Analysis and Zeeman Doppler Imaging (PCA-ZDI) multi-line\ntechnique, based on accurate polarised spectral line synthesis.\n  Methods. In this paper we present the methodology to perform inversions of\nprofiles obtained with PCA-ZDI.\n  Results. Inversions with various magnetic geometries, field strengths and\nrotational velocities show that we can correctly determine the effective\nlongitudinal magnetic field in stars using the PCA-ZDI method.\n", "  We classify the sign of the critical Casimir force between two finite objects\nseparated by a large distance in the two dimensional systems that can be\ndescribed by conformal field theory (CFT). In particular, we show that as far\nas the smallest scaling dimension present in the spectrum of the system is\nsmaller than one, the sign of the force is independent of the shape of the\nobjects and can be determined by the elements of the modular $S$-matrix of the\nCFT. The provided formula for the sign of the force indicates that the force is\nalways attractive for equal boundary conditions independent of the shape of the\nobjects. However, different boundary conditions can lead to attractive or\nrepulsive forces. Using the derived formula, we prove the known results\nregarding the Ising model and the free bosons. As new examples, we give\ndetailed results regarding the Q=3-states Potts model and the compactified\nbosons. In particular, for the latter model we show that Dirichlet boundary\ncondition does not always lead to an attractive force.\n", "  We present ALMA observations of the inner 1' (1.2 kpc) of the Circinus\ngalaxy, the nearest Seyfert. We target CO (1-0) in the region associated with a\nwell-known multiphase outflow driven by the central active galactic nucleus\n(AGN). While the geometry of Circinus and its outflow make disentangling the\nlatter difficult, we see indications of outflowing molecular gas at velocities\nconsistent with the ionized outflow. We constrain the mass of the outflowing\nmolecular gas to be 1.5e5 -5.1e6 solar masses, yielding a molecular outflow\nrate of 0.35-12.3 solar masses per year. The values within this range are\ncomparable to the star formation rate in Circinus, indicating that the outflow\nindeed regulates star formation to some degree. The molecular outflow in\nCircinus is considerably lower in mass and energetics than previously-studied\nAGN-driven outflows, especially given its high ratio of AGN luminosity to\nbolometric luminosity. The molecular outflow in Circinus is, however,\nconsistent with some trends put forth in Cicone et al. (2014), including a\nlinear relation between kinetic power and AGN luminosity, as well as its\nmomentum rate vs. bolometric luminosity (although the latter places Circinus\namong the starburst galaxies in that sample). We detect additional molecular\nspecies including CN and C17O.\n", "  Recent studies suggest that coalescing neutron stars are subject to a fluid\ninstability involving the nonlinear coupling of the tide to $p$-modes and\n$g$-modes. Its influence on the inspiral dynamics and thus the gravitational\nwave signal is, however, uncertain because we do not know precisely how the\ninstability saturates. Here we construct a simple, physically motivated model\nof the saturation that allows us to explore the instability's impact as a\nfunction of the model parameters. We find that for plausible assumptions about\nthe saturation, current gravitational wave detectors might miss $> 70\\%$ of\nevents if only point particle waveforms are used. Parameters such as the chirp\nmass, component masses, and luminosity distance might also be significantly\nbiased. On the other hand, we find that relatively simple modifications to the\npoint particle waveform can alleviate these problems and enhance the science\nthat emerges from the detection of binary neutron stars.\n", "  Pulsar timing observations have revealed planets around only a few pulsars.\nWe suggest that the rarity of these planets is due mainly to two effects.\nFirst, we show that the most likely formation mechanism requires the\ndestruction of a companion star. Only pulsars with a suitable companion (with\nan extreme mass ratio) are able to form planets. Second, while a dead zone (a\nregion of low turbulence) in the disk is generally thought to be essential for\nplanet formation, it is most probably rare in disks around pulsars because of\nthe irradiation from the pulsar. The irradiation strongly heats the inner parts\nof the disk pushing the inner boundary of the dead zone out. We suggest that\nthe rarity of pulsar planets can be explained by the low probability for these\ntwo requirements - a very low-mass companion and a dead zone - to be satisfied.\n", "  Most metal-rich AGB/RGB stars present strong Li underabundances, since this\nelement is easily destroyed in the high temperatures of the stellar interiors.\nIn spite of this fact, several of these stars are Li-rich, having Li abundances\ngiven by log (Li/H) + 12 > 1.5. In the present work, we extend our previous\ninvestigation on AGB/RGB stars to the expected mass loss rates of these stars.\nSpecifically, we look for correlations between the Li abundances and the mass\nloss rates or related parameters in Li-rich AGB/RGB stars. We have estimated\nthe mass loss rates using a modified form of the Reimers formula and applied it\nto a large sample of 104 Li-rich giant stars for which reliable stellar data\nare available. Our proposed method assumes a linear relation between the\nstellar luminosity and the Li abundance, so that the luminosity can be\nestimated from the Li abundance. The stellar mass is then obtained from the\neffective temperature and luminosity using recent evolutionary tracks. The\nstellar radius can be determined from the stellar gravity, so that the mass\nloss rate can be calculated using an adequate calibration involving both\nLi-rich and Li-poor stars in the AGB/RGB branches. The results show that most\nLi-rich stars have lower mass loss rates compared with C-rich or O-rich giants\nthat do not present Li enhancements.\n", "  The atmospheric circulation in Venus is well known to exhibit strong\nsuper-rotation. However, the atmospheric mechanisms responsible for the\nformation of this super-rotation are still not fully understood. In this work,\nwe developed a new Venus general circulation model to study the most likely\nmechanisms driving the atmosphere to the current observed circulation. Our\nmodel includes a new radiative transfer, convection and suitably adapted\nboundary layer schemes and a dynamical core that takes into account the\ndependence of the heat capacity at constant pressure with temperature.\n  The new Venus model is able to simulate a super-rotation phenomenon in the\ncloud region quantitatively similar to the one observed. The mechanisms\nmaintaining the strong winds in the cloud region were found in the model\nresults to be a combination of zonal mean circulation, thermal tides and\ntransient waves. In this process, the semi-diurnal tide excited in the upper\nclouds has a key contribution in transporting axial angular momentum mainly\nfrom the upper atmosphere towards the cloud region. The magnitude of the\nsuper-rotation in the cloud region is sensitive to various radiative parameters\nsuch as the amount of solar radiative energy absorbed by the surface, which\ncontrols the static stability near the surface. In this work, we also discuss\nthe main difficulties in representing the flow below the cloud base in Venus\natmospheric models.\n  Our new radiative scheme is more suitable for 3D Venus climate models than\nthose used in previous work due to its easy adaptability to different\natmospheric conditions. This flexibility of the model was crucial to explore\nthe uncertainties in the lower atmospheric conditions and may also be used in\nthe future to explore, for example, dynamical-radiative-microphysical\nfeedbacks.\n", "  Given the potential of ensemble asteroseismology for understanding\nfundamental properties of large numbers of stars, it is critical to determine\nthe accuracy of the scaling relations on which these measurements are based.\nFrom several powerful validation techniques, all indications so far show that\nstellar radius estimates from the asteroseismic scaling relations are accurate\nto within a few percent. Eclipsing binary systems hosting at least one star\nwith detectable solar-like oscillations constitute the ideal test objects for\nvalidating asteroseismic radius and mass inferences. By combining\nradial-velocity measurements and photometric time series of eclipses, it is\npossible to determine the masses and radii of each component of a double-lined\nspectroscopic binary. We report the results of a four-year radial-velocity\nsurvey performed with the \\'echelle spectrometer of the Astrophysical Research\nConsortium's 3.5-m telescope and the APOGEE spectrometer at Apache Point\nObservatory. We compare the masses and radii of 10 red giants obtained by\ncombining radial velocities and eclipse photometry with the estimates from the\nasteroseismic scaling relations. We find that the asteroseismic scaling\nrelations overestimate red-giant radii by about 5% on average and masses by\nabout 15% for stars at various stages of red-giant evolution. Systematic\noverestimation of mass leads to underestimation of stellar age, which can have\nimportant implications for ensemble asteroseismology used for Galactic studies.\nAs part of a second objective, where asteroseismology is used for understanding\nbinary systems, we confirm that oscillations of red giants in close binaries\ncan be suppressed enough to be undetectable, an hypothesis that was proposed in\na previous work.\n", "  We study the quantum mechanics of self-gravitating thin shell collapse by\nsolving the polymerized Wheeler-DeWitt equation. We obtain the energy spectrum\nand solve the time dependent equation using numerics. In contradistinction to\nthe continuum theory, we are able to consistently quantize the theory for\nsuper-Planckian black holes, and find two choices of boundary conditions which\nconserve energy and probability, as opposed to one in the continuum theory.\nAnother feature unique to the polymer theory is the existence of negative\nenergy stationary states that disappear from the spectrum as the polymer scale\ngoes to zero. In both theories the probability density is positive\nsemi-definite only for the space of positive energy stationary states.\nDynamically, we find that an initial Gaussian probability density develops\nregions of negative probability as the wavepacket approaches $R=0$ and bounces.\nThis implies that the bouncing state is a sum of both positive and negative\neigenstates.\n", "  Searching for active galactic nuclei (AGN) in dwarf galaxies is important for\nour understanding of the seed black holes that formed in the early Universe.\nHere, we test infrared selection methods for AGN activity at low galaxy masses.\nOur parent sample consists of ~18,000 nearby dwarf galaxies (M*< 3 x 10^9 Msun,\n$z<0.055$) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with significant detections in the\nfirst three bands of the AllWISE data release from the Wide-field Infrared\nSurvey Explorer (WISE). First, we demonstrate that the majority of\noptically-selected AGNs in dwarf galaxies are not selected as AGNs using WISE\ninfrared color diagnostics and that the infrared emission is dominated by the\nhost galaxies. We then investigate the infrared properties of\noptically-selected star-forming dwarf galaxies, finding that the galaxies with\nthe reddest infrared colors are the most compact, with blue optical colors,\nyoung stellar ages and large specific star formation rates. These results\nindicate that great care must be taken when selecting AGNs in dwarf galaxies\nusing infrared colors, as star-forming dwarf galaxies are capable of heating\ndust in such a way that mimics the infrared colors of more luminous AGNs. In\nparticular, a simple $\\mathrm{W1}-\\mathrm{W2}$ color cut alone should not be\nused to select AGNs in dwarf galaxies. With these complications in mind, we\npresent a sample of 41 dwarf galaxies worthy of follow-up observations that\nfall in WISE infrared color space typically occupied by more luminous AGNs.\n", "  Recent observations show that the white dwarfs (WDs) in cataclysmic Variables\n(CVs) have an average mass significantly higher than isolated WDs and WDs in\npost-common envelope binaries (PCEBs), which are thought to the progenitors of\nCVs. This suggests that either the WDs have grown in mass during the PCEB/CV\nevolution or the binaries with low-mass WDs are unable to evolve to be CVs. In\nthis paper, we calculate the evolution of accreting WD binaries with updated\nhydrogen accumulation efficiency and angular momentum loss prescriptions. We\nshow that thermal timescale mass transfer is not effective in changing the\naverage WD mass distribution. The WD mass discrepancy is most likely related to\nunstable mass transfer in WD binaries in which an efficient mechanism of\nangular momentum loss is required.\n", "  The solar observatory Einstein Tower (Einsteinturm) at the Telegrafenberg in\nPotsdam is both a landmark of modern architecture and an important place for\nsolar physics. Originally built for high-resolution spectroscopy and measuring\nthe gravitational redshift, research shifted over the years to understanding\nthe active Sun and its magnetic field. Nowadays, telescope and spectrographs\nare used for research and development, i.e., testing instruments and in\nparticular polarization optics for advanced instrumentation deployed at major\nEuropean and international astronomical and solar telescopes. In addition, the\nEinstein Tower is used for educating and training of the next generation\nastrophysicists as well as for education and public outreach activities\ndirected at the general public. This article comments on the observatory's\nunique architecture and the challenges of maintaining and conserving the\nbuilding. It describes in detail the characteristics of telescope,\nspectrographs, and imagers; it portrays some of the research and development\nactivities.\n", "  We derive formulas for Whispering Gallery Mode resonances and bending losses\nin infinite cylindrical dielectric shells and sets of concentric cylindrical\nshells. The formulas also apply to spherical shells and to sections of bent\nwaveguides. The derivation is based on a WKB treatment of Helmholtz equation\nand can in principle be extended to any number of concentric shells. A\ndistinctive limit analytically arises in the analysis when two shells are\nbrought at very close distance to one another. In that limit, the two shells\nact as a slot waveguide. If the two shells are sufficiently apart, we identify\na structural resonance between the individual shells, which can either lead to\na substantial enhancement or suppression of radiation losses.\n", "  I model the effect of rapid stellar rotation on a planet's insolation.\nFast-rotating stars have induced pole-to-equator temperature gradients (known\nas gravity-darkening) of up to several thousand Kelvin that affect the star's\nluminosity and peak emission wavelength as a function of latitude. When\norbiting such a star, a planet's annual insolation can strongly vary depending\non its orbit inclination. Specifically, inclined orbits result in temporary\nexposure to the star's hotter poles. I find that gravity-darkening can drive\nchanges in a planet's equilibrium temperature of up to $\\sim15\\%$ due to\nincreased irradiance near the stellar poles. This effect can also vary a\nplanet's exposure to UV radiation by up to $\\sim80\\%$ throughout its orbit as\nit is exposed to an irradiance spectrum corresponding to different stellar\neffective temperatures over time.\n", "  In recent work done by Sun et. al., the color variation of quasars, namely\nthe bluer-when-brighter trend, was found to be timescale-dependent using SDSS\n$g/r$ band light curves in the Stripe 82. Such timescale dependence, i.e.,\nbluer variation at shorter timescales, supports the thermal fluctuation origin\nof the UV/optical variation in quasars, and can be well modeled with the\ninhomogeneous accretion disk model. In this paper, we extend the study to much\nshorter wavelengths in the rest frame (down to extreme UV), using GALaxy\nEvolution eXplorer (GALEX) photometric data of quasars collected in two\nultraviolet bands (near-UV and far-UV). We develop Monte-Carlo simulations to\ncorrect possible biases due to the considerably larger photometric\nuncertainties in GALEX light curves (particularly in far-UV, comparing with\nSDSS $g/r$ bands), which otherwise could produce artificial results. We\nsecurely confirm the previously discovered timescale dependence of the color\nvariability with independent datasets and at shorter wavelengths. We further\nfind the slope of the correlation between the amplitude of color variation and\ntimescale however appears even steeper than that predicted by the inhomogeneous\ndisk model, which assumes that disk fluctuations follow damped random walk\nprocess. In line with the much flatter structure function observed in far-UV\ncomparing with that at longer wavelengths, this implies deviation from DRW\nprocess in the inner disk where rest frame extreme UV radiation is produced.\n", "  We have conducted a search for L subdwarf candidates within the photometric\ncatalogues of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey and Sloan Digital Sky Survey.\nSix of our candidates are confirmed as L subdwarfs spectroscopically at optical\nand/or near infrared wavelengths. We also present new optical spectra of three\npreviously known L subdwarfs (WISEA J001450.17-083823.4, 2MASS\nJ00412179+3547133, ULAS J124425.75+102439.3). We examined the spectral types\nand metallicity subclasses classification of known L subdwarfs. We summarised\nthe spectroscopic properties of L subdwarfs with different spectral types and\nsubclasses. We classify these new L subdwarfs by comparing their spectra to\nknown L subdwarfs and L dwarf standards. We estimate temperatures and\nmetallicities of 22 late type M and L subdwarfs by comparing their spectra to\nBT-Settl models. We find that L subdwarfs have temperatures between 1500 K and\n2700 K, which are higher than similarly-typed L dwarfs by around 100-400 K\ndepending on different subclasses and subtypes. We constrained the metallicity\nranges of subclasses of M, L and T subdwarfs. We also discussed the spectral\ntype and absolute magnitude relationships for L and T subdwarfs.\n", "  Red quasars are candidate young objects in an early transition stage of\nmassive galaxy evolution. Our team recently discovered a population of\nextremely red quasars (ERQs) in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey\n(BOSS) that has a suite of peculiar emission-line properties including large\nrest equivalent widths (REWs), unusual \"wingless\" line profiles, large NV/Lya,\nNV/CIV, SiIV/CIV and other flux ratios, and very broad and blueshifted [OIII]\n5007. Here we present a new catalog of CIV and NV emission-line data for\n216,188 BOSS quasars to characterize the ERQ line properties further. We show\nthat they depend sharply on UV-to-mid-IR color, secondarily on REW(CIV), and\nnot at all on luminosity or the Baldwin Effect. We identify a \"core\" sample of\n97 ERQs with nearly uniform peculiar properties selected via i-W3 > 4.6 (AB)\nand REW(CIV) > 100 A at redshifts 2.0-3.4. A broader search finds 235 more red\nquasars with similar unusual characteristics. The core ERQs have median\nluminosity log L (ergs/s) ~ 47.1, sky density 0.010 deg^-2, surprisingly\nflat/blue UV spectra given their red UV-to-mid-IR colors, and common outflow\nsignatures including BALs or BAL-like features and large CIV emission-line\nblueshifts. Their SEDs and line properties are inconsistent with normal quasars\nbehind a dust reddening screen. We argue that the core ERQs are a unique\nobscured quasar population with extreme physical conditions related to powerful\noutflows across the line-forming regions. Patchy obscuration by small dusty\nclouds could produce the observed UV extinctions without substantial UV\nreddening.\n", "  We here review asymptotically flat rotating black holes in the presence of\nnon-Abelian gauge fields. Like their static counterparts these black holes are\nno longer uniquely determined by their global charges. In the case of pure\nSU(2) Yang-Mills fields, the rotation generically induces an electric charge,\nwhile the black holes do not carry a magnetic charge. When a Higgs field is\ncoupled, rotating black holes with monopole hair arise in the case of a Higgs\ntriplet, while in the presence of a complex Higgs doublet the black holes carry\nsphaleron hair. The inclusion of a dilaton allows for Smarr type mass formulae.\n", "  We spectroscopically re-observed the gravitational lens system SDSS\nJ1339+1310 using OSIRIS on the GTC. We also monitored the $r$-band variability\nof the two quasar images (A and B) with the LT over 143 epochs in the period\n2009$-$2016. These new data in both the wavelength and time domains have\nconfirmed that the system is an unusual microlensing factory. The\nC$\\scriptsize{\\rm{IV}}$ emission line is remarkably microlensed, since the\nmicrolensing magnification of B relative to that for A, $\\mu_{\\rm{BA}}$,\nreaches a value of 1.4 ($\\sim$ 0.4 mag) for its core. Moreover, the B image\nshows a red wing enhancement of C$\\scriptsize{\\rm{IV}}$ flux (relative to A),\nand $\\mu_{\\rm{BA}}$ = 2 (0.75 mag) for the C$\\scriptsize{\\rm{IV}}$ broad-line\nemission. Regarding the nuclear continuum, we find a chromatic behaviour of\n$\\mu_{\\rm{BA}}$, which roughly varies from $\\sim$ 5 (1.75 mag) at 7000 \\AA\\ to\n$\\sim$ 6 (1.95 mag) at 4000 \\AA. We also detect significant microlensing\nvariability in the $r$ band, and this includes a number of microlensing events\non timescales of 50$-$100 d. Fortunately, the presence of an intrinsic 0.7 mag\ndip in the light curves of A and B, permitted us to measure the time delay\nbetween both quasar images. This delay is $\\Delta t_{\\rm{AB}}$ = 47$^{+5}_{-6}$\nd (1$\\sigma$ confidence interval; A is leading), in good agreement with\npredictions of lens models.\n", "  The observed scale heights of extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (eDIG) layers\nexceed their thermal scale heights by a factor of a few in the Milky Way and\nother nearby edge-on disk galaxies. Here, we test a dynamical equilibrium model\nof the extraplanar diffuse ionized gas layer in NGC 891, where we ask whether\nthe thermal, turbulent, magnetic field, and cosmic ray pressure gradients are\nsufficient to support the layer. In optical emission line spectroscopy from the\nSparsePak integral field unit on the WIYN 3.5-meter telescope, the H-alpha\nemission in position-velocity space suggests that the eDIG is found in a ring\nbetween galactocentric radii of R_min <= R <= 8 kpc, where R_min >= 2 kpc. We\nfind that the thermal (sigma_th = 11 km/s) and turbulent (sigma_turb = 25 km/s)\nvelocity dispersions are insufficient to satisfy the hydrostatic equilibrium\nequation given an exponential electron scale height of h_z = 1.0 kpc. Using a\nliterature analysis of radio continuum observations from the CHANG-ES survey,\nwe demonstrate that the magnetic field and cosmic ray pressure gradients are\nsufficient to stably support the gas at R >= 8 kpc if the cosmic rays are\nsufficiently coupled to the system (gamma_cr = 1.45). Thus, a stable dynamical\nequilibrium model is viable only if the extraplanar diffuse ionized gas is\nfound in a thin ring around R = 8 kpc, and non-equilibrium models such as a\ngalactic fountain flow are of interest for further study.\n", "  Much of the inner Milky Way's (MW) global rotation and velocity dispersion\npatterns can be reproduced by models of secularly-evolved, bar-dominated\nbulges. More sophisticated constraints, including the higher moments of the\nline-of-sight velocity distributions (LOSVDs) and limits on the chemodynamical\nsubstructure, are critical for interpreting observations of the unresolved\ninner regions of extragalactic systems and for placing the MW in context with\nother galaxies. Here, we use SDSS-APOGEE data to develop these constraints, by\npresenting the first maps of the LOSVD skewness and kurtosis of metal-rich and\nmetal-poor inner MW stars (divided at [Fe/H] = -0.4), and comparing the\nobserved patterns to those that are seen both in N-body models and in\nextragalactic bars. Despite closely matching the mean velocity and dispersion,\nthe models do not reproduce the observed LOSVD skewness patterns in different\nways, which demonstrates that our understanding of the detailed orbital\nstructure of the inner MW remains an important regime for improvement. We find\nevidence in the MW of the skewness-velocity correlation that is used as a\ndiagnostic of extragalactic bar/bulges. This correlation appears in metal-rich\nstars only, providing further evidence for different evolutionary histories of\nchemically differentiated populations. We connect these skewness measurements\nto previous work on high-velocity \"peaks\" in the inner Galaxy, confirming the\npresence of that phenomenon, and we quantify the cylindrical rotation of the\ninner Galaxy, finding that the latitude-independent rotation vanishes outside\nof lon ~ 7 deg. Finally, we evaluate the MW data in light of select\nextragalactic bar diagnostics and discuss progress and challenges of using the\nMW as a resolved analog of unresolved stellar populations.\n", "  We present a detailed spectral analysis of XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations\nof the accreting transient black hole GRS 1739-278 during a very faint low hard\nstate at ~0.02% of the Eddington luminosity (for a distance of 8.5 kpc and a\nmass of 10 M_sun ). The broad-band X-ray spectrum between 0.5-60 keV can be\nwell-described by a power law continuum with an exponential cutoff. The\ncontinuum is unusually hard for such a low luminosity, with a photon index of\nGamma = 1.39 +/- 0.04. We find evidence for an additional reflection component\nfrom an optically thick accretion disk at the 98% likelihood level. The\nreflection fraction is low with R_refl = 0.043(+0.033,-0.023). In combination\nwith measurements of the spin and inclination parameters made with NuSTAR\nduring a brighter hard state by Miller and co-workers, we seek to constrain the\naccretion disk geometry. Depending on the assumed emissivity profile of the\naccretion disk, we find a truncation radius of 15-35 Rg (5-12 R_ISCO ) at the\n90% confidence limit. These values depend strongly on the assumptions and we\ndiscuss possible systematic uncertainties.\n", "  Graphene and other two-dimensional materials display remarkable optical\nproperties, including a simple light transparency of $T \\approx 1 - \\pi \\alpha$\nfor light in the visible region. Most theoretical rationalizations of this\n\"universal\" opacity employ a model coupling light to the electron's crystal\nmomentum and put emphasis on the linear dispersion of the graphene bands.\nHowever, such a formulation of interband absorption is not allowable within\nband structure theory, because it conflates the crystal momentum label with the\ncanonical momentum operator. We show that the physical origin of the optical\nbehavior of graphene can be explained within a straightforward picture with the\ncorrect use of canonical momentum coupling. Its essence lies in the\ntwo-dimensional character of the density of states rather than in the precise\ndispersion relation, and therefore the discussion is applicable to other\nsystems such as semiconductor membranes. At higher energies the calculation\npredicts a peak corresponding to a van Hove singularity as well as a specific\nasymmetry in the absorption spectrum of graphene, in agreement with previous\nresults.\n", "  $Context:$ Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBHs) are thought to be the seeds\nof early Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs). While $\\gtrsim$100 IMBH and small\nSMBH candidates have been identified in recent years, few have been robustly\nconfirmed to date, leaving their number density in considerable doubt. Placing\nfirmer constraints both on the methods used to identify and confirm\nIMBHs/SMBHs, as well as characterizing the range of host environments that\nIMBHs/SMBHs likely inhabit is therefore of considerable interest and\nimportance. Additionally, finding significant numbers of IMBHs in metal-poor\nsystems would be particularly intriguing, since such systems may represent\nlocal analogs of primordial galaxies, and therefore could provide clues of\nearly accretion processes.\n  $Aims:$ Here we study in detail several candidate Active Galactic Nuclei\n(AGN) found in metal-poor hosts.\n  $Methods:$ We utilize new X-ray and optical observations to characterize\nthese metal-poor AGN candidates and compare them against known AGN luminosity\nrelations and well-characterized IMBH/SMBH samples.\n  $Results:$ Despite having clear broad optical emission lines that are\nlong-lived ($\\gtrsim$10--13\\,yr), these candidate AGN appear to lack associated\nstrong X-ray and hard UV emission, lying at least 1--2 dex off the known AGN\ncorrelations. If they are IMBHs/SMBHs, our constraints imply that they either\nare not actively accreting, their accretion disks are fully obscured along our\nline-of-sight, or their accretion disks are not producing characteristic high\nenergy emission. Alternatively, if they are not AGN, then their luminous broad\nemission lines imply production by extreme stellar processes. The latter would\nhave profound implications on the applicability of broad lines for mass\nestimates of massive black holes.\n", "  This paper presents a summary of four invited and twelve contributed\npresentations on asymptotic giant branch stars and red supergiants, given over\nthe course of two afternoon splinter sessions at the 19th Cool Stars Workshop.\nIt highlights both recent observations and recent theory, with some emphasis on\nhigh spatial resolution, over a wide range of wavelengths. Topics covered\ninclude 3D models, convection, binary interactions, mass loss, dust formation\nand magnetic fields.\n", "  The determination of atmospheric parameters depends on the use of radiative\ntransfer codes (among other elements such as model atmospheres) to compute\nsynthetic spectra and/or derive abundances from equivalent widths. However, it\nis common to mix results from different surveys/studies where different setups\nwere used to derive the parameters. These inhomogeneities can lead us to\ninaccurate conclusions. In this work, we studied one aspect of the problem:\nWhen deriving atmospheric parameters from high-resolution stellar spectra, what\ndifferences originate from the use of different radiative transfer codes?\n", "  We study the temporal evolution of the Na I D1 line profiles in the M3.9\nflare SOL2014-06-11T21:03 UT, using high spectral resolution observations\nobtained with the IBIS instrument on the Dunn Solar Telescope combined with\nradiative hydrodynamic simulations. Our results show a significant increase in\nline core and wing intensities during the flare. The analysis of the line\nprofiles from the flare ribbons reveal that the Na I D1 line has a central\nreversal with excess emission in the blue wing (blue asymmetry). We combine\nRADYN and RH simulations to synthesise Na I D1 line profiles of the flaring\natmosphere and find good agreement with the observations. Heating with a beam\nof electrons modifies the radiation field in the flaring atmosphere and excites\nelectrons from the ground state $\\mathrm{3s~^2S}$ to the first excited state\n$\\mathrm{3p~^2P}$, which in turn modifies relative population of the two\nstates. The change in temperature and the population density of the energy\nstates make the sodium line profile revert from absorption into emission.\nAnalysis of the simulated spectra also reveals that the Na I D1 flare profile\nasymmetries are produced by the velocity gradients generated %and opacity\neffects in the lower solar atmosphere.\n", "  Most globular clusters (GCs) are now known to host multiple stellar\npopulations with different light element abundances. Here we use narrow-band\nphotometry and low-resolution spectroscopy for NGC 362 and NGC 6723 to\ninvestigate their chemical properties and radial distributions of\nsubpopulations. We confirm that NGC 362 and NGC 6723 are among the GCs with\nmultiple populations showing bimodal CN distribution and CN-CH anti-correlation\nwithout a significant spread in calcium abundance. These two GCs show more\ncentrally concentrated CN-weak earlier generation stars compared to the later\ngeneration CN-strong stars. These trends are reversed with respect to those\nfound in previous studies for many other GCs. Our findings, therefore, seem\ncontradictory to the current scenario for the formation of multiple stellar\npopulations, but mass segregation acting on the two subpopulations might be a\npossible solution to explain this reversed radial trend.\n", "  We present elemental abundances for all seven stars in Moving Group W11450\n(Latham 1) to determine if they may be chemically related. These stars appear\nto be both spatially and kinematically related, but no spectroscopic abundance\nanalysis exists in literature. Abundances for eight elements were derived via\nequivalent width analyses of high resolution (R $\\sim$60,000), high\nsignal-to-noise ratio ($\\langle$SNR$\\rangle\\sim$100) spectra obtained with the\nOtto Struve 2.1m telescope and Sandiford Echelle Spectrograph at McDonald\nObservatory. The large star-to-star scatter in metallicity, -0.55 $\\leq$ [Fe/H]\n$\\leq$ 0.06 dex ($\\sigma$= 0.25), implies these stars were not produced from\nthe same chemically homogeneous molecular cloud, and are therefore not part of\na remnant or open cluster as previously proposed. Prior to this analysis, it\nwas suggested that two stars in the group, W11449 & W11450, are possible wide\nbinaries. The candidate wide binary pair show similar chemical abundance\npatterns with not only iron, but with other elements analyzed in this study,\nsuggesting the proposed connection between these two stars may be real.\n", "  Decades of work on beam deformation on reflection, and especially on lateral\nshifts, have spread the idea that a reflected beam is larger than the incident\nbeam. However, when the right conditions are met, a beam reflected by a\nmultilayered resonant structure can be 10\\% narrower than the incoming beam.\nSuch an easily measurable change occurs on a very narrow angular range close to\na resonance, which can be leveraged to improve the resolution of sensors based\non the detection of surface plasmon resonances by a factor three. We provide\ntheoretical tools to deal with this effect, and a thorough physical discussion\nthat leads to expect similar phenomenon to occur for temporal wavepackets and\nin other domains of physics.\n", "  NGC 288 is a diffuse Galactic globular cluster, it is remarkable in that its\nlow density results in internal accelerations being below the critical MOND\n$a_{0}$ acceleration throughout. This makes it an ideal testing ground for\nMONDian gravity, as the details of the largely unknown transition function\nbetween the Newtonian and modified regimes become unimportant. Further, exact\nanalytical solutions exist for isothermal spherical equilibrium structures in\nMOND, allowing for arbitrary values of the anisotropy parameter, $\\beta$. In\nthis paper we use observations of the velocity dispersion profile of NGC 288,\nwhich is in fact isothermal, as dynamical constraints on MONDian models for\nthis cluster, where the remaining free parameters are adjusted to fit the\nobserved surface brightness profile. We find the optimal fit requires $\\beta\n=0$, an isotropic solution with a total mass of $3.5 \\pm 1.1 \\times 10^{4}\nM_{\\odot}$.\n", "  We have used (a) HST ACS imaging and STIS spectroscopy, (b) ground-based\nPIONIER/VLT long-baseline interferometry, and (c) ground-based spectroscopy\nfrom different instruments to study the orbit of the extreme multiple system HD\n93 129 Aa,Ab, which is composed of (at least) two very massive stars in a\nlong-period orbit with e>0.92 that will pass through periastron in 2017/2018.\nIn several ways, the system is an eta Car precursor. Around the time of\nperiastron passage the two very strong winds will collide and generate an\noutburst of non-thermal hard X-ray emission without precedent in an O+O binary\nsince astronomers have been able to observe above Earth's atmosphere. A\ncoordinated multiwavelength monitoring in the next two years will enable a\nbreakthrough understanding of the wind interactions in such extreme close\nencounters. Furthermore, we have found evidence that HD 93 129 Aa may be a\nbinary system itself. In that case, we could witness a three-body interaction\nthat may yield a runaway star or a stellar collision close to or shortly after\nthe periastron passage. Either of those outcomes would be unprecedented, as\nthey are predicted to be low-frequency events in the Milky Way.\n", "  We present Chandra ACIS-S and ATCA radio continuum observations of the\nstrongly lensed dusty, star-forming galaxy SPT-S J034640-5204.9 (hereafter\nSPT0346-52) at $z$ = 5.656. This galaxy has also been observed with ALMA, HST,\nSpitzer, Herschel, APEX, and the VLT. Previous observations indicate that if\nthe infrared (IR) emission is driven by star formation, then the inferred\nlensing-corrected star formation rate ($\\sim$ 4500 $M_{\\sun}$ yr$^{-1}$) and\nstar formation rate surface density $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$ ($\\sim$ 2000 $M_{\\sun}\n{yr^{-1}} {kpc^{-2}}$) are both exceptionally high. It remained unclear from\nthe previous data, however, whether a central active galactic nucleus (AGN)\ncontributes appreciably to the IR luminosity. The {\\it Chandra} upper limit\nshows that SPT0346-52 is consistent with being star-formation dominated in the\nX-ray, and any AGN contribution to the IR emission is negligible. The ATCA\nradio continuum upper limits are also consistent with the FIR-to-radio\ncorrelation for star-forming galaxies with no indication of an additional AGN\ncontribution. The observed prodigious intrinsic IR luminosity of (3.6 $\\pm$\n0.3) $\\times$ 10$^{13}$ $L_{\\sun}$ originates almost solely from vigorous star\nformation activity. With an intrinsic source size of 0.61 $\\pm$ 0.03 kpc,\nSPT0346-52 is confirmed to have one of the highest $\\Sigma_{SFR}$ of any known\ngalaxy. This high $\\Sigma_{SFR}$, which approaches the Eddington limit for a\nradiation pressure supported starburst, may be explained by a combination of\nvery high star formation efficiency and gas fraction.\n", "  Future large scale structure surveys will provide increasingly tight\nconstraints on our cosmological model. These surveys will report results on the\ndistance scale and growth rate of perturbations through measurements of Baryon\nAcoustic Oscillations and Redshift-Space Distortions. It is interesting to ask:\nwhat further analyses should become routine, so as to test as-yet-unknown\nmodels of cosmic acceleration? Models which aim to explain the accelerated\nexpansion rate of the Universe by modifications to General Relativity often\ninvoke screening mechanisms which can imprint a non-standard density dependence\non their predictions. This suggests density-dependent clustering as a `generic'\nconstraint. This paper argues that a density-marked correlation function\nprovides a density-dependent statistic which is easy to compute and report and\nrequires minimal additional infrastructure beyond what is routinely available\nto such survey analyses. We give one realization of this idea and study it\nusing low order perturbation theory. We encourage groups developing modified\ngravity theories to see whether such statistics provide discriminatory power\nfor their models.\n", "  The luminosity of young giant planets can inform about their formation and\naccretion history. The directly imaged planets detected so far are consistent\nwith the \"hot-start\" scenario of high entropy and luminosity. If nebular gas\npasses through a shock front before being accreted into a protoplanet, the\nentropy can be substantially altered. To investigate this, we present high\nresolution, 3D radiative hydrodynamic simulations of accreting giant planets.\nThe accreted gas is found to fall with supersonic speed in the gap from the\ncircumstellar disk's upper layers onto the surface of the circumplanetary disk\nand polar region of the protoplanet. There it shocks, creating an extended hot\nsupercritical shock surface. This shock front is optically thick, therefore, it\ncan conceal the planet's intrinsic luminosity beneath. The gas in the vertical\ninflux has high entropy which when passing through the shock front decreases\nsignificantly while the gas becomes part of the disk and protoplanet. This\nshows that circumplanetary disks play a key role in regulating a planet's\nthermodynamic state. Our simulations furthermore indicate that around the shock\nsurface extended regions of atomic - sometimes ionized - hydrogen develop.\nTherefore circumplanetary disk shock surfaces could influence significantly the\nobservational appearance of forming gas-giants.\n", "  We present a microscopic theory of nonlinear damping and dephasing of\nlow-frequency eigenmodes in nano- and micro-mechanical systems. The mechanism\nof the both effects is scattering of thermally excited vibrational modes off\nthe considered eigenmode. The scattering is accompanied by energy transfer of\n$2\\hbar\\omega_0$ for nonlinear damping and is quasieleastic for dephasing. We\ndevelop a formalism that allows studying both spatially uniform systems and\nsystems with a strong nonuniformity, which is smooth on the typical wavelength\nof thermal modes but not their mean free path. The formalism accounts for the\ndecay of thermal modes, which plays a major role in the nonlinear damping and\ndephasing. We identify the nonlinear analogs of the Landau-Rumer,\nthermoelastic, and Akhiezer mechanisms and find the dependence of the\nrelaxation parameters on the temperature and the geometry of a system.\n", "  Template-based extrapolations from only one photometric band can be a\ncost-effective method to estimate the total infrared (IR) luminosities\n($L_{\\mathrm{IR}}$) of galaxies. By utilizing multi-wavelength data that covers\nacross 0.35--500\\,$\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ in GOODS-North and GOODS-South fields, we\ninvestigate the accuracy of this monochromatic extrapolated $L_{\\mathrm{IR}}$\nbased on three IR spectral energy distribution (SED) templates\n(\\citealt[CE01]{Chary2001}; \\citealt[DH02]{Dale2002};\n\\citealt[W08]{Wuyts2008a}) out to $z\\sim 3.5$. We find that the CE01 template\nprovides the best estimate of $L_{\\mathrm{IR}}$ in {\\it Herschel}/PACS bands,\nwhile the DH02 template performs best in {\\it Herschel}/SPIRE bands. To\nestimate $L_{\\mathrm{IR}}$, we suggest that extrapolations from the available\nlongest wavelength PACS band based on the CE01 template can be a good\nestimator. Moreover, if PACS measurement is unavailable, extrapolations from\nSPIRE observations but based on the \\cite{Dale2002} template can also provide a\nstatistically unbiased estimate for galaxies at $z\\lesssim 2$. The emission of\nrest-frame 10--100\\,$\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ range of IR SED can be well described by\nall the three templates, but only the DH02 template shows nearly unbiased\nestimate of the emission of the rest-frame submillimeter part.\n", "  Hydrogen and helium demix when sufficiently cool, and this bears on the\nevolution of all giant planets at large separations at or below roughly a\nJupiter mass. We model the thermal evolution of Jupiter, including its evolving\nhelium distribution following results of ab initio simulations for helium\nimmiscibility in metallic hydrogen. After 4 Gyr of homogeneous evolution,\ndifferentiation establishes a thin helium gradient below 1 Mbar that\ndynamically stabilizes the fluid to convection. The region undergoes overstable\ndouble-diffusive convection (ODDC), whose weak heat transport maintains a\nsuperadiabatic temperature gradient. With a generic parameterization for the\nODDC efficiency, the models can reconcile Jupiter's intrinsic flux, atmospheric\nhelium content, and radius at the age of the solar system if the Lorenzen et\nal. H-He phase diagram is translated to lower temperatures. We cast the\nevolutionary models in an MCMC framework to explore tens of thousands of\nevolutionary sequences, retrieving probability distributions for the total\nheavy element mass, the superadiabaticity of the temperature gradient due to\nODDC, and the phase diagram perturbation. The adopted SCvH-I equation of state\nfavors inefficient ODDC such that a thermal boundary layer is formed, allowing\nthe molecular envelope to cool rapidly while the deeper interior actually heats\nup over time. If the overall cooling time is modulated with an additional free\nparameter to imitate the effect of a colder or warmer EOS, the models favor\nthose that are colder than SCvH-I. In this case the superadiabaticity is modest\nand a warming or cooling deep interior are equally likely.\n", "  We target the thermal emission spectrum of the non-transiting gas giant HD\n88133 b with high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy, by treating the planet\nand its host star as a spectroscopic binary. For sufficiently deep summed flux\nobservations of the star and planet across multiple epochs, it is possible to\nresolve the signal of the hot gas giant's atmosphere compared to the brighter\nstellar spectrum, at a level consistent with the aggregate shot noise of the\nfull data set. To do this, we first perform a principal component analysis to\nremove the contribution of the Earth's atmosphere to the observed spectra.\nThen, we use a cross-correlation analysis to tease out the spectra of the host\nstar and HD 88133 b to determine its orbit and identify key sources of\natmospheric opacity. In total, six epochs of Keck NIRSPEC L band observations\nand three epochs of Keck NIRSPEC K band observations of the HD 88133 system\nwere obtained. Based on an analysis of the maximum likelihood curves calculated\nfrom the multi-epoch cross correlation of the full data set with two\natmospheric models, we report the direct detection of the emission spectrum of\nthe non-transiting exoplanet HD 88133 b and measure a radial projection of the\nKeplerian orbital velocity of 40 $\\pm$ 15 km/s, a true mass of\n1.02$^{+0.61}_{-0.28}M_J$, a nearly face-on orbital inclination of\n15${^{+6}_{-5}}^{\\circ}$, and an atmosphere opacity structure at high\ndispersion dominated by water vapor. This, combined with eleven years of radial\nvelocity measurements of the system, provides the most up-to-date ephemeris for\nHD 88133.\n", "  We present new spatially resolved astrometry and photometry from the Gemini\nPlanet Imager of the inner binary of the young multiple star system V343\nNormae, which is a member of the beta Pictoris moving group. V343 Normae\ncomprises a K0 and mid-M star in a ~4.5 year orbit (AaAb) and a wide 10\" M5\ncompanion (B). By combining these data with archival astrometry and radial\nvelocities we fit the orbit and measure individual masses for both components\nof M_Aa = 1.10 +/- 0.10 M_sun and M_Ab = 0.290 +/- 0.018 M_sun. Comparing to\ntheoretical isochrones, we find good agreement for the measured masses and JHK\nband magnitudes of the two components consistent with the age of the beta Pic\nmoving group. We derive a model-dependent age for the beta Pic moving group of\n26 +/- 3 Myr by combining our results for V343 Normae with literature\nmeasurements for GJ 3305, which is another group member with resolved binary\ncomponents and dynamical masses.\n", "  William P. Bidelman--Editor of Publications of the Astronomical Society of\nthe Pacific from 1956 to 1961--passed away on 2011 May 3, at the age of 92. He\nwas one of the last of the masters of visual stellar spectral classification\nand the identification of peculiar stars. I review his contributions to these\nsubjects, including the discoveries of barium stars, hydrogen-deficient stars,\nhigh-galactic-latitude supergiants, stars with anomalous carbon content, and\nexotic chemical abundances in peculiar A and B stars. Bidelman was legendary\nfor his encyclopedic knowledge of the stellar literature. He had a profound and\ninspirational influence on many colleagues and students. Some of the bizarre\nstellar phenomena he discovered remain unexplained to the present day.\n", "  Atomic interferometry can be used to probe dark energy models coupled to\nmatter. We consider the constraints coming from recent experimental results on\nmodels generalising the inverse power law chameleons such as $f(R)$ gravity in\nthe large curvature regime, the environmentally dependent dilaton and\nsymmetrons. Using the tomographic description of these models, we find that\nonly symmetrons with masses smaller than the dark energy scale can be\nefficiently tested. In this regime, the resulting constraints complement the\nbounds from the E\\\"otwash experiment and exclude small values of the symmetron\nself-coupling.\n", "  While the velocity fluctuations of supergranulation dominate the spectrum of\nsolar convection at the solar surface, very little is known about the\nfluctuations in other physical quantities like temperature or density at\nsupergranulation scale. Using SDO/HMI observations, we characterize the\nintensity contrast of solar supergranulation at the solar surface. We identify\nthe positions of ${\\sim}10^4$ outflow and inflow regions at supergranulation\nscales, from which we construct average flow maps and co-aligned intensity and\nmagnetic field maps. In the average outflow center, the maximum intensity\ncontrast is $(7.8\\pm0.6)\\times10^{-4}$ (there is no corresponding feature in\nthe line-of-sight magnetic field). This corresponds to a temperature\nperturbation of about $1.1\\pm0.1$ K, in agreement with previous studies. We\ndiscover an east-west anisotropy, with a slightly deeper intensity minimum east\nof the outflow center. The evolution is asymmetric in time: the intensity\nexcess is larger 8 hours before the reference time (the time of maximum\noutflow), while it has almost disappeared 8 hours after the reference time. In\nthe average inflow region, the intensity contrast mostly follows the magnetic\nfield distribution, except for an east-west anisotropic component that\ndominates 8 hours before the reference time. We suggest that the east-west\nanisotropy in the intensity is related to the wave-like properties of\nsupergranulation.\n", "  High-contrast scattered light observations have revealed the surface\nmorphology of several dozens of protoplanetary disks at optical and\nnear-infrared wavelengths. Inclined disks offer the opportunity to measure part\nof the phase function of the dust grains that reside in the disk surface which\nis essential for our understanding of protoplanetary dust properties and the\nearly stages of planet formation. We aim to construct a method which takes into\naccount how the flaring shape of the scattering surface of an (optically thick)\nprotoplanetary disk projects onto the image plane of the observer. This allows\nus to map physical quantities (scattering radius and scattering angle) onto\nscattered light images and retrieve stellar irradiation corrected (r^2-scaled)\nimages and dust phase functions. We apply the method on archival polarized\nintensity images of the protoplanetary disk around HD 100546 that were obtained\nwith VLT/SPHERE in R'-band and VLT/NACO in H- and Ks-band. The brightest side\nof the r^2-scaled R'-band polarized intensity image of HD 100546 changes from\nthe far to the near side of the disk when a flaring instead of a geometrically\nflat disk surface is used for the r^2-scaling. The decrease in polarized\nsurface brightness in the scattering angle range of ~40-70 deg is likely a\nresult of the dust phase function and degree of polarization which peak in\ndifferent scattering angle regimes. The derived phase functions show part of a\nforward scattering peak which indicates that large, aggregate dust grains\ndominate the scattering opacity in the disk surface. Projection effects of a\nprotoplanetary disk surface need to be taken into account to correctly\ninterpret scattered light images. Applying the correct scaling for the\ncorrection of stellar irradiation is crucial for the interpretation of the\nimages and the derivation of the dust properties in the disk surface layer.\n", "  We compute the non-thermal emissions produced by relativistic particles\naccelerated by the AGN-driven shocks in NGC 1068, and we compare the model\npredictions with the observed gamma-ray and radio spectra . The former is\ncontributed by pion decay, inverse Compton scattering, and bremsstrahlung,\nwhile the latter is produced by synchrotron radiation. We derive the gamma-ray\nand radio emissions by assuming the standard acceleration theory, and we\ndiscuss how our results compare with those corresponding to other commonly\nassumed sources of gamma-ray and radio emissions, like Supernova remnants (SNR)\nor AGN jets. We find that the AGN-driven shocks observed in the circumnuclear\nmolecular disk of such a galaxy provide a contribution to the gamma-ray\nemission comparable to that provided by the starburst activity when standard\nparticle acceleration efficiencies are assumed, while they can yield the whole\ngamma-ray emission only when the parameters describing the acceleration\nefficiency and the proton coupling with the molecular gas are tuned to values\nlarger than those assumed in standard, SNR-driven shocks. We discuss the range\nof acceleration efficiencies (for protons and electrons) and of proton\ncalorimetric fractions required to account for the observed gamma-ray emission\nin the AGN outflow model. We further compare the neutrino flux expected in our\nmodel with constraints from current experiments, and we provide predictions for\nthe detections by the upcoming KM3NeT neutrino telescope. This analysis\nstrongly motivates observations of NGC 1068 at >TeV energies with current and\nfuture Cherenkov telescopes in order to gain insight into the nature of the\ngamma-rays source.\n", "  It is well known that two types of gravitational wave memory exist in general\nrelativity (GR): the linear memory and the non-linear, or Christodoulou memory.\nThese effects, especially the latter, depend on the specific form of Einstein\nequation. It can then be speculated that in modified theories of gravity, the\nmemory can differ from the GR prediction, and provides novel phenomena to study\nthese theories. We support this speculation by considering scalar-tensor\ntheories, for which we find two new types of memory: the T memory and the S\nmemory, which contribute to the tensor and scalar components of gravitational\nwave, respectively. In particular, the former is caused by the burst of energy\ncarried away by scalar radiation, while the latter is intimately related to the\nno scalar hair property of black holes in scalar-tensor gravity. We estimate\nthe size of these two types of memory in gravitational collapses, and formulate\na detection strategy for the S memory, which can be singled out from tensor\ngravitational waves. We show that (i) the S memory exists even in spherical\nsymmetry, and is observable under current model constraints, and (ii) while the\nT memory is usually much weaker than the S memory, it can become comparable in\nthe case of spontaneous scalarization.\n", "  We calculate the reflection and transmission probabilities in a\none-dimensional Fermi gas with an equal mixing of the Rashba and Dresselhaus\nspin-orbit coupling (RD-SOC) produced by an external Raman laser field. These\nprobabilities are computed over multiple relevant energy ranges within the\npseudo-potential approximation. Strong scattering resonances are found whenever\nthe incident energy approaches either a scattering threshold or a quasi-bound\nstate attached to one of the energetically closed higher dispersion branches. A\nstriking difference is demonstrated between two very different regimes set by\nthe Raman laser intensity, namely between scattering for the single- minimum\ndispersion versus the double-minimum dispersion at the lowest threshold. The\npresence of RD-SOC together with the Raman field fundamentally changes the\nscattering behavior and enables the realization of very different\none-dimensional theoretical models in a single experimental setup when combined\nwith a confinement-induced resonance.\n", "  We analyze a 37 pb$^{-1}$ data sample collected with the SND detector at the\nVEPP-2000 $e^+e^-$ collider in the center-of-mass energy range 1.05--2.00 GeV\nand present an updated measurement of the $e^+e^- \\to \\omega \\pi^0 \\to\n\\pi^0\\pi^0\\gamma$ cross section. In particular, we correct the mistake in\nradiative correction calculation made in our previous measurement based on a\npart of the data. The measured cross section is fitted with the vector meson\ndominance model with three $\\rho$-like states and used to test the conserved\nvector current hypothesis in the $\\tau^-\\to\\omega\\pi^-\\nu_{\\tau}$ decay.\n", "  By considering Hadamard vacuum states, we first construct the two-point\nfunctions associated with Stueckelberg massive electromagnetism in de Sitter\nand anti-de Sitter spacetimes. Then, from the general formalism developed in\n[A. Belokogne and A. Folacci, Phys. Rev. D \\textbf{93}, 044063 (2016)], we\nobtain an exact analytical expression for the vacuum expectation value of the\nrenormalized stress-energy tensor of the massive vector field propagating in\nthese maximally symmetric spacetimes.\n", "  Motivated by recent measurements of the radiative decay rates of the\n\\emph{P}-wave spin singlet charmonium $h_c$ to the light meson $\\eta$ or\n$\\eta^\\prime$ by the BESIII Collaboration, we investigate the decay rates of\nthese channels at order $\\alpha \\alpha_s^4$. The photon is radiated mainly from\ncharm quark pairs in the lowest order Feynman diagrams, since the diagrams\nwhere a photon radiated from light quarks are suppressed by $\\alpha_s$ or the\nrelative charm quark velocity $v$, due to Charge parity conservation. The form\nfactors of two gluons to $\\eta$ or $\\eta^\\prime$ are employed, which are the\nmajor mechanism for $\\eta$ and $\\eta^\\prime$ productions. $\\eta(\\eta^\\prime)$\nis treated as a light cone object when we consider that the parent charmonium\nmass is much heavier than that of the final light meson. We obtain the\nbranching ratio ${\\cal B}(h_c\\to \\gamma\\eta^\\prime) =\n(1.94^{+0.70}_{-0.51})\\times 10^{-3}$ in the nonrelativistic QCD approach,\nwhich is in agreement with the BESIII measurement. The prediction of the\nbranching ratio of $h_c\\to \\gamma\\eta$ is also within the range of experimental\nerror after including the larger uncertainty of the total decay width\n$\\Gamma_{h_c}$. The applications of these formulae to the radiative decays to\n$\\eta(\\eta^\\prime)$ of the \\emph{P}-wave spin singlet bottomonium $h_b(nP)$ are\npresented. These studies will shed some light on the $\\eta - \\eta^\\prime$\nmixing effects, the flavor SU(3) symmetry breaking, as well as the\nnonperturbative dynamics of charmonium and bottomonium.\n", "  We present a case study of how topology can affect synchronization.\nSpecifically, we consider arrays of phase oscillators coupled in a ring or a\nchain topology. Each ring is perfectly matched to a chain with the same initial\nconditions and the same random natural frequencies. The only difference is\ntheir boundary conditions: periodic for a ring, and open for a chain. For both\ntopologies, stable phase-locked states exist if and only if the spread or\n\"width\" of the natural frequencies is smaller than a critical value called the\nlocking threshold (which depends on the boundary conditions and the particular\nrealization of the frequencies). The central question is whether a ring\nsynchronizes more readily than a chain. We show that it usually does, but not\nalways. Rigorous bounds are derived for the ratio between the locking\nthresholds of a ring and its matched chain, for a variant of the Kuramoto model\nthat also includes a wider family of models.\n", "  We study constraints on one-loop neutral naturalness at the LHC by\nconsidering gluon partners which are required to ameliorate the tuning in the\nHiggs mass-squared arising at two loops. This is done with a simple orbifold\nmodel of folded supersymmetry which not only contains color-neutral stops but\nalso bifundamental gluinos that are charged under the Standard Model color\ngroup $SU(3)_C$ and a separate $SU(3)_C'$ group. The bifundamental gluinos\nreduce the Higgs mass tuning at two loops and maintain naturalness provided the\ngluinos are lighter than approximately 1.9 TeV for a 5 TeV cutoff scale. Limits\nfrom the LHC already forbid bifundamental gluinos below 1.4 TeV, and other\nnon-colored states such as electroweakinos, $Z'$ bosons and dark sector bound\nstates may be probed at future colliders. The search for bifundamental gluinos\ntherefore provides a direct probe of one-loop neutral naturalness that can be\nfully explored at the LHC.\n", "  We consider an asymptotically free vectorial gauge theory, with gauge group\n$G$ and $N_f$ fermions in a representation $R$ of $G$, having an infrared (IR)\nzero in the beta function at $\\alpha_{IR}$. We present general formulas for\nscheme-independent series expansions of quantities, evaluated at $\\alpha_{IR}$,\nas powers of an $N_f$-dependent expansion parameter, $\\Delta_f$. First, we\napply these to calculate the derivative $d\\beta/d\\alpha$ evaluated at\n$\\alpha_{IR}$, denoted $\\beta'_{IR}$, which is equivalent to the anomalous\ndimension of the ${\\rm Tr}(F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu})$ operator, to order\n$\\Delta_f^4$ for general $G$ and $R$, and to order $\\Delta_f^5$ for $G={\\rm\nSU}(3)$ and fermions in the fundamental representation. Second, we calculate\nthe scheme-independent expansions of the anomalous dimension of the\nflavor-nonsinglet and flavor-singlet bilinear fermion antisymmetric Dirac\ntensor operators up to order $\\Delta_f^3$. The results are compared with\nrigorous upper bounds on anomalous dimensions of operators in conformally\ninvariant theories. Our other results include an analysis of the limit $N_c \\to\n\\infty$, $N_f \\to \\infty$ with $N_f/N_c$ fixed, calculation and analysis of\nPad\\'e approximants, and comparison with conventional higher-loop calculations\nof $\\beta'_{IR}$ and anomalous dimensions as power series in $\\alpha$.\n", "  The super-luminous object ASASSN-15lh (SN2015L) is an extreme event with a\ntotal energy $E_{rad}\\simeq 1.1\\times 10^{52}$ erg in black body radiation on\npar with its kinetic energy $E_k$ in ejecta and a late time plateau in the UV,\nthat defies a nuclear origin. It likely presents a new explosion mechanism for\nhydrogen-deprived supernovae. With no radio emission and no H-rich environment\nwe propose to identify $E_{rad}$ with dissipation of a baryon-poor outflow in\nthe optically thick remnant stellar envelope produced by a central engine. By\nnegligible time scales of light crossing and radiative cooling of the envelope,\nSN2015L's light curve closely tracks the evolution of this engine. We here\nmodel its light curve by the evolution of black hole spin, during angular\nmomentum loss in Alv\\'en waves to matter at the Inner Most Stable Circular\nOrbit (ISCO). The duration is determined by $\\sigma=M_T/M$ of the torus mass\n$M_T$ around the black hole of mass $M$: $\\sigma\\sim 10^{-7}$ and $\\sigma\\sim\n10^{-2}$ for SN2015L and, respectively, a long GRB. The observed\nelectromagnetic radiation herein represents a minor output of the rotational\nenergy $E_{rot}$ of the black hole, while most is radiated unseen in\ngravitational radiation. This model explains the high-mass slow-spin binary\nprogenitor of GWB150914, as the remnant of two CC-SNe in an intra-day binary of\ntwo massive stars. This model rigorously predicts a change in magnitude $\\Delta\nm\\simeq 1.15$ in the light curve post-peak, in agreement with the light curve\nof SN2015L with no fine-tuning.\n", "  The spatial distribution of gas and solids in protoplanetary disks determines\nthe composition and formation efficiency of planetary systems. A number of\ndisks show starkly different distributions for the gas and small grains\ncompared to millimeter-centimeter sized dust. We present new Atacama Large\nMillimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the dust continuum, CO,\n$^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O in the IM Lup protoplanetary disk, one of the first\nsystems where this dust-gas dichotomy was clearly seen. The $^{12}$CO is\ndetected out to a radius of 970 AU, while the millimeter continuum emission is\ntruncated at just 313 AU. Based upon this data, we have built a comprehensive\nphysical and chemical model for the disk structure, which takes into account\nthe complex, coupled nature of the gas and dust and the interplay between the\nlocal and external environment. We constrain the distributions of gas and dust,\nthe gas temperatures, the CO abundances, the CO optical depths, and the\nincident external radiation field. We find that the reduction/removal of dust\nfrom the outer disk exposes this region to higher stellar and external\nradiation and decreases the rate of freeze-out, allowing CO to remain in the\ngas out to large radial distances. We estimate a gas-phase CO abundance of\n$5\\%$ of the ISM value and a low external radiation field ($G_0\\lesssim4$). The\nlatter is consistent with that expected from the local stellar population. We\nadditionally find tentative evidence for ring-like continuum substructure,\nsuggestions of isotope-selective photodissociation, and a diffuse gas halo.\n", "  Accreting stellar mass black holes (BHs) routinely exhibit Type-C\nquasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). These are often interpreted as\nLense-Thirring precession of the inner accretion flow, a relativistic effect\nwhereby the spin of the BH distorts the surrounding space-time, inducing nodal\nprecession. The best evidence for the precession model is the recent discovery,\nusing a long joint XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observation of H 1743-322, that the\ncentroid energy of the iron fluorescence line changes systematically with QPO\nphase. This was interpreted as the inner flow illuminating different azimuths\nof the accretion disc as it precesses, giving rise to a blue/red shifted iron\nline when the approaching/receding disc material is illuminated. Here, we\ndevelop a physical model for this interpretation, including a self-consistent\nreflection continuum, and fit this to the same H 1743-322 data. We use an\nanalytic function to parameterise the asymmetric illumination pattern on the\ndisc surface that would result from inner flow precession, and find that the\ndata are well described if two bright patches rotate about the disc surface.\nThis model is preferred to alternatives considering an oscillating disc\nionisation parameter, disc inner radius and radial emissivity profile. We find\nthat the reflection fraction varies with QPO phase (3.5 sigma), adding to the\nnow formidable body of evidence that Type-C QPOs are a geometric effect. This\nis the first example of tomographic QPO modelling, initiating a powerful new\ntechnique that utilizes QPOs in order to map the dynamics of accreting material\nclose to the BH.\n", "  Finding solar-analog stars with fundamental properties as close as possible\nto the Sun and studying the characteristics of their surface magnetic activity\nis a very promising way to understand the solar variability and its associated\ndynamo process. However, the identification of solar-analog stars depends on\nthe accuracy of the estimated stellar parameters. Thanks to the photometric\nCoROT and Kepler space missions, the addition of asteroseismic data was proven\nto provide the most accurate fundamental properties that can be derived from\nstellar modeling today. Here, we present our latest results on the\nsolar-stellar connection by studying 18 solar analogs that we identified among\nthe Kepler seismic sample (Salabert et al., 2016a). We measured their magnetic\nactivity properties using the observations collected by the Kepler satellite\nand the ground-based, high-resolution HERMES spectrograph. The photospheric\n(Sph) and chromospheric (S) magnetic activity proxies of these seismic solar\nanalogs are compared in relation to the solar activity. We show that the\nactivity of the Sun is comparable to the activity of the seismic solar analogs,\nwithin the maximum-to-minimum temporal variations of the 11-year solar activity\ncycle. Furthermore, we report on the discovery of temporal variability in the\nacoustic frequencies of the young (1 Gyr-old) solar analog KIC10644253 with a\nmodulation of about 1.5 years, which agrees with the derived photospheric\nactivity Sph (Salabert et al, 2016b). It could be the signature of the\nshort-period modulation, or quasi-biennal oscillation, of its magnetic activity\nas observed in the Sun and in the 1-Gyr-old solar analog HD30495. In addition,\nthe lithium abundance and the chromospheric activity estimated from HERMES\nconfirms that KIC10644253 is a young and more active star than the Sun.\n", "  We present the results of a survey of interstellar O~{\\small VI} absorption\nin the Milky Way (MW) towards {69} stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)\nobtained with the \\textit{Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE)}. The\nintegrated MW O~{\\small VI} column densities log N(O~{\\small VI}) are in the\nrange from 13.68 to 14.73 with a mean of {14.26$_{-0.09}^{+0.07}$} atoms\ncm$^{-2}$. The O~{\\small VI} exponential scale height is found to be\n{2.28$\\pm$1.06} kpc. The O~{\\small VI} column density correlates with the\nDoppler parameter $\\it b$. The O~{\\small VI} velocity dispersion ranges from\n{14.0 to 91.6 with an average value of 62.7 km s$^{-1}$}. These high values of\nvelocity dispersion reveal the effect of turbulence, multiple velocity\ncomponents and collision on broad O~{\\small VI} profiles. There is a\nsignificant variation of O~{\\small VI} column density on all scales studied\n{(0.0025$\\degr$ - 6.35$\\degr$)}. The smallest scale for which O~{\\small VI}\ncolumn density variations has been found is {$\\bigtriangleup \\theta$\n$\\sim$~9$\\arcsec$}. Comparison of the O~{\\small VI} velocity profiles with\nFe~{\\small II} indicates the presence of intermediate velocity cloud (IVC)\nand/or high velocity cloud (HVC) components in the O~{\\small VI} absorption.\n", "  Nuclear Star Clusters (NSCs) are commonly observed in the centres of most\ngalactic nuclei, including our own Milky Way. While their study can reveal\nimportant information about the build-up of the innermost regions of galaxies,\nthe physical processes that regulate their formation are still poorly\nunderstood. NSCs might have been formed through gas infall and subsequent in\nsitu star formation, and/or through the infall and merging of multiple star\nclusters into the centre of the galaxy. Here, we investigate the viability of\nthe latter, by studying direct N-body simulations of inspiralling clusters to\nthe centre of a Milky-Way-like nuclear bulge that hosts a massive black hole.\nWe find that the NSC that forms through this process can show both\nmorphological and kinematical properties that make it comparable with\nobservations of the Milky Way NSC, including significant rotation- a fact that\nhas been so far attributed mainly to gas infall. We explore its kinematic\nevolution, to see if and how the merger history can imprint fossil records on\nits dynamical structure. Moreover, we study the effect of stellar foreground\ncontamination in the line-of-sight kinematics of the NSC. Our study shows that\nno fine tuning of the orientation of the infalling globular clusters is\nnecessary to result in a rotating NSC. We suggest that cluster-inspiral is a\nviable mechanism for the formation of rotating NSCs.\n", "  By making use of a simple model that captures the key features of the\nanomalous Maxwell equations, we study the role of inhomogeneities on the\nevolution of magnetic fields in a chiral plasma. We find that inhomogeneities\nof the chiral asymmetry by themselves do not prevent the anomaly-driven inverse\ncascade and, as in the homogeneous case, the magnetic helicity is transferred\nfrom shorter to longer wavelength helical modes of the magnetic field. However,\nwe also find that the evolution appears to be sensitive to the effects of\ndiffusion. In the case when diffusion is negligible, the inverse cascade slows\ndown considerably compared to the homogeneous scenario. In the case of the\nprimordial plasma, though, we find that the diffusion is substantial and\nefficiently suppresses chiral asymmetry inhomogeneities. As a result, the\ninverse cascade proceeds practically in the same way as in the chirally\nhomogeneous model.\n", "  Origin of enigmatic line profiles of extremely luminous type IIn supernova\nSN~2006gy on day 96 is explored. Among conceivable possibilities the most\npreferred is the model that suggests holes in the optically thick cool dense\nshell (CDS). The line radiation emitted at the inner side of the opaque CDS\nescapes through the holes thus producing unusual line profile with the emission\nshifted redward. The holes could emerge as a result of a vigorous\nRayleigh-Taylor instability leading to the CDS fragmentation. The model light\ncurve with the CDS fragmentation is shown to be consistent with the SN~2006gy\nbolometric light curve.\n", "  We discuss the G\\\"{o}del-type solutions within the dynamical Chern-Simons\nmodified gravity in four dimensions. Within our study, we show that in the\nvacuum case the causal solutions are possible which cannot take place within\nthe non-dynamical framework. Another our result consists in the possibility for\ncompletely causal solutions for all types of matters we study in the paper,\nthat is, relativistic fluid, cosmological constant, scalar and electromagnetic\nfields.\n", "  Circumplanetary disks can be found around forming giant planets, regardless\nof whether core accretion or gravitational instability built the planet. We\ncarried out state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations of the circumplanetary\ndisks for both formation scenarios, using as similar initial conditions as\npossible to unveil possible intrinsic differences in the circumplanetary disk\nmass and temperature between the two formation mechanisms. We found that the\ncircumplanetary disks mass linearly scales with the circumstellar disk mass.\nTherefore, in an equally massive protoplanetary disk, the circumplanetary disks\nformed in the disk instability model can be only a factor of eight more massive\nthan their core-accretion counterparts. On the other hand, the bulk\ncircumplanetary disk temperature differs by more than an order of magnitude\nbetween the two cases. The subdisks around planets formed by gravitational\ninstability have a characteristic temperature below 100 K, while the core\naccretion circumplanetary disks are hot, with temperatures even greater than\n1000 K when embedded in massive, optically thick protoplanetary disks. We\nexplain how this difference can be understood as the natural result of the\ndifferent formation mechanisms. We argue that the different temperatures should\npersist up to the point when a full-fledged gas giant forms via disk\ninstability, hence our result provides a convenient criteria for observations\nto distinguish between the two main formation scenarios by measuring the bulk\ntemperature in the planet vicinity.\n", "  We have analyzed four epochs of H$\\alpha$ and [S~II] HST images of the HH~1/2\noutflow (covering a time interval from 1994 to 2014) to determine proper\nmotions and emission line fluxes of the knots of HH~2. We find that our new\nproper motions agree surprisingly well with the motions measured by Herbig \\&\nJones (1981), although there is partial evidence for a slight deceleration of\nthe motion of the HH~2 knots from 1945 to 2014. We also measure the\ntime-variability of the H$\\alpha$ intensities and the [S~II]/H$\\alpha$ line\nratios, and find that knots H and A have the largest intensity variabilities\n(in $1994\\to 2014$). Knot H (which now dominates the HH~2 emission) has\nstrengthened substantially, while keeping an approximately constant\n[S~II]/H$\\alpha$ ratio. Knot A has dramatically faded, and at the same time has\nhad a substantial increase in its [S~II]/H$\\alpha$ ratio. Possible\ninterpretations of these results are discussed.\n", "  Angular power spectra of optical and infrared background anisotropies at\nwavelengths between 0.5 to 5 $\\mu$m are a useful probe of faint sources present\nduring reionization, in addition to faint galaxies and diffuse signals at low\nredshift. The cross-correlation of these fluctuations with backgrounds at other\nwavelengths can be used to separate some of these signals. A previous study on\nthe cross-correlation between X-ray and $Spitzer$ fluctuations at 3.6 $\\mu$m\nand 4.5 $\\mu$m has been interpreted as evidence for direct collapse blackholes\n(DCBHs) present at $z > 12$. Here we return to this cross-correlation and study\nits wavelength dependence from 0.5 to 4.5 $\\mu$m using $Hubble$ and $Spitzer$\ndata in combination with a subset of the 4 Ms $Chandra$ observations in\nGOODS-S/ECDFS. Our study involves five $Hubble$ bands at 0.6, 0.7, 0.85, 1.25\nand 1.6 $\\mu$m, and two $Spitzer$-IRAC bands at 3.6 $\\mu$m and 4.5 $\\mu$m. We\nconfirm the previously seen cross-correlation between 3.6 $\\mu$m (4.5 $\\mu$m)\nand X-rays with 3.7$\\sigma$ (4.2$\\sigma$) and 2.7$\\sigma$ (3.7$\\sigma$)\ndetections in the soft [0.5-2] keV and hard [2-8] keV X-ray bands,\nrespectively, at angular scales above 20 arcseconds. The cross-correlation of\nX-rays with $Hubble$ is largely anticorrelated, ranging between the levels of\n1.4$-$3.5$\\sigma$ for all the $Hubble$ and X-ray bands. This lack of\ncorrelation in the shorter optical/NIR bands implies the sources responsible\nfor the cosmic infrared background at 3.6 and 4.5~$\\mu$m are at least partly\ndissimilar to those at 1.6 $\\mu$m and shorter.\n", "  The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offers unprecedented sensitivity,\nstability, and wavelength coverage for transiting exoplanet studies, opening up\nnew avenues for measuring atmospheric abundances, structure, and temperature\nprofiles. Taking full advantage of JWST spectroscopy of planets from 0.6um to\n28um, however, will require many observations with a combination of the NIRISS,\nNIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI instruments. In this white paper, we discuss a new\nNIRCam mode (not yet approved or implemented) that can reduce the number of\nnecessary observations to cover the 1.0um to 5.0um wavelength range. Even\nthough NIRCam was designed primarily as an imager, it also includes several\ngrisms for phasing and aligning JWST's 18 hexagonal mirror segments. NIRCam's\nlong-wavelength channel includes grisms that cover 2.4um to 5.0um with a\nresolving power of R = 1200 - 1550 using two separate configurations. The\nlong-wavelength grisms have already been approved for science operations,\nincluding wide field and single object (time series) slitless spectroscopy. We\npropose a new mode that will simultaneously measure spectra for science targets\nin the 1.0um to 2.0um range using NIRCam's short-wavelength channel. This mode,\nif approved, would take advantage of NIRCam's Dispersed Hartmann Sensor (DHS),\nwhich produces 10 spatially separated spectra per source at R ~ 300. We discuss\nthe added benefit of the DHS in constraining abundances in exoplanet\natmospheres as well as its ability to observe the brightest systems. The DHS\nessentially comes for free (at no time cost) with any NIRCam long-wavelength\ngrism observation, but the detector integration parameters have to be selected\nto ensure that the long-wavelength grism observations do not saturate and that\nJWST data volume downlink constraints are not violated.\n", "  We report on the detection in the combined $Gaia$-DR1/RAVE data of a lack of\ndisk stars in the solar neighbourhood with velocities close to zero angular\nmomentum. We propose that this may be caused by the scattering of stars with\nvery low angular momentum onto chaotic, halo-type orbits when they pass through\nthe Galactic nucleus. We model the effect in a Milky-Way like potential and fit\nthe resulting model directly to the data, finding a likelihood\n($\\sim2.7\\sigma$) of a dip in the distribution. Using this effect, we can make\na dynamical measurement of the Solar rotation velocity around the Galactic\ncenter: $v_{\\odot}=239\\pm9$ km s$^{-1}$. Combined with the measured proper\nmotion of Sgr A$^*$, this measurement gives a measurement of the distance to\nthe Galactic centre: $R_0=7.9\\pm0.3$ kpc.\n", "  Galaxy starlight at 3.6$\\mu$m is an excellent tracer of stellar mass. Here we\nuse the latest 3.6$\\mu$m imaging from the Spitzer Space Telescope to measure\nthe total stellar mass and effective radii in a homogeneous way for a sample of\ngalaxies from the SLUGGS survey. These galaxies are representative of nearby\nearly-type galaxies in the stellar mass range of 10 $<$ log\nM$_{\\ast}$/M$_{\\odot}$ $<$ 11.7, and our methodology can be applied to other\nsamples of early-type galaxies. We model each galaxy in 2D and estimate its\ntotal asymptotic magnitude from a 1D curve-of-growth. Magnitudes are converted\ninto stellar masses using a 3.6$\\mu$m mass-to-light ratio from the latest\nstellar population models of R\\\"ock et al., assuming a Kroupa IMF. We apply a\nratio based on each galaxy's mean mass-weighted stellar age within one\neffective radius (the mass-to-light ratio is insensitive to galaxy metallicity\nfor the generally old stellar ages and high metallicities found in massive\nearly-type galaxies). Our 3.6$\\mu$m stellar masses agree well with masses\nderived from 2.2$\\mu$m data. From the 1D surface brightness profile we fit a\nsingle Sersic law, excluding the very central regions. We measure the effective\nradius, Sersic n parameter and effective surface brightness for each galaxy. We\nfind that galaxy sizes derived from shallow optical imaging and the 2MASS\nsurvey tend to underestimate the true size of the largest, most massive\ngalaxies in our sample. We adopt the 3.6$\\mu$m stellar masses and effective\nradii for the SLUGGS survey galaxies.\n", "  [Abridged] Regions of low ionisation where the activity of the\nmagneto-rotational instability is suppressed, the so-called dead zones, have\nbeen suggested to explain gaps and asymmetries of transition disks. We\ninvestigate the gas and dust evolution simultaneously assuming simplified\nprescriptions for a dead zone and a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind acting on\nthe disk. We explore whether the resulting gas and dust distribution can create\nsignatures similar to those observed in transition disks. For the dust\nevolution, we included the transport, growth, and fragmentation of dust\nparticles. To compare with observations, we produced synthetic images in\nscattered optical light and in thermal emission at mm wavelengths. In all\nmodels with a dead zone, a bump in the gas surface density is produced that is\nable to efficiently trap large particles ($\\gtrsim 1$ mm) at the outer edge of\nthe dead zone. The gas bump reaches an amplitude of a factor of $\\sim5$, which\ncan be enhanced by the presence of an MHD wind that removes mass from the inner\ndisk. While our 1D simulations suggest that such a structure can be present\nonly for $\\sim$1 Myr, the structure may be maintained for a longer time when\nmore realistic 2D/3D simulations are performed. In the synthetic images,\ngap-like low-emission regions are seen at scattered light and in thermal\nemission at mm wavelengths, as previously predicted in the case of planet-disk\ninteraction. As a conclusion, main signatures of transition disks can be\nreproduced by assuming a dead zone in the disk, such as gap-like structure in\nscattered light and millimetre continuum emission, and a lower gas surface\ndensity within the dead zone. Previous studies showed that the Rossby wave\ninstability can also develop at the edge of such dead zones, forming vortices\nand also creating asymmetries.\n", "  We present a chiral solution of the Ginsparg-Wilson equation. This work is\nmotivated by our recent proposal for nonperturbatively regulating chiral gauge\ntheories, where five-dimensional domain wall fermions couple to a\nfour-dimensional gauge field that is extended into the extra dimension as the\nsolution to a gradient flow equation. Mirror fermions at the far surface\ndecouple from the gauge field as if they have form factors that become\ninfinitely soft as the distance between the two surfaces is increased. In the\nlimit of an infinite extra dimension we derive an effective four-dimensional\nchiral overlap operator which is shown to obey the Ginsparg-Wilson equation,\nand which correctly reproduces a number of properties expected of chiral gauge\ntheories in the continuum.\n", "  We present the results of the analysis of deep photometric data for a sample\nof three Galactic globular clusters (NGC5466, NGC6218 and NGC6981) with the aim\nof estimating their degree of mass segregation and testing the predictions of\nanalytic dynamical models. The adopted dataset, composed by both Hubble Space\nTelescope and ground based data, reaches the low-mass end of the mass functions\nof these clusters from the center up to their tidal radii allowing to derive\ntheir radial distribution of stars with different masses. All the analysed\nclusters show evidence of mass segregation with the most massive stars more\nconcentrated than low-mass ones. The structures of NGC5466 and NGC6981 are well\nreproduced by multimass dynamical models adopting a lowered-Maxwellian\ndistribution function and the prescription for mass segregation given by Gunn &\nGriffin (1979). Instead, NGC6218 appears to be more mass segregated than model\npredictions. By applying the same technique to mock observations derived from\nsnapshots selected from suitable N-body simulations we show that the deviation\nfrom the behaviour predicted by these models depends on the particular stage of\ndynamical evolution regardless of initial conditions.\n", "  One of the most accurate models currently used to represent the gravity field\nof irregular bodies is the polyhedral approach. In this model, the mass of the\nbody is assumed to be homogeneous, which may not be true for a real object. The\nmain goal of the present paper is to study the dynamical effects induced by\nthree different internal structures (uniform, three- and four-layers) of\nasteroid (21) Lutetia, an object that recent results from space probe suggest\nbeing at least partially differentiated. The Mascon gravity approach used in\nthe present work, consists of dividing each tetrahedron into eight parts to\ncalculate the gravitational field around the asteroid. The zero-velocity curves\nshow that the greatest displacement of the equilibrium points occurs in the\nposition of the E4 point for the four-layers structure and the smallest one\noccurs in the position of the E3 point for the three-layers structure.\nMoreover, stability against impact shows that the planar limit gets slightly\ncloser to the body with the four-layered structure.\n  We then investigated the stability of orbital motion in the equatorial plane\nof (21) Lutetia and propose numerical stability criteria to map the region of\nstable motions. Layered structures could stabilize orbits that were unstable in\nthe homogeneous model.\n", "  The application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the estimation of HI\ngas mass fraction (\\fgas) is investigated, based on a sample of 13,674 galaxies\nin the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with HI detections or upper limits from\nthe Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFALFA). We show that, for\nan example set of fixed input parameters ($g-r$ colour and $i$-band surface\nbrightness), a multidimensional quadratic model yields \\fgas\\ scaling relations\nwith a smaller scatter (0.22 dex) than traditional linear fits (0.32 dex),\ndemonstrating that non-linear methods can lead to an improved performance over\ntraditional approaches. A more extensive ANN analysis is performed using 15\ngalaxy parameters that capture variation in stellar mass, internal structure,\nenvironment and star formation. Of the 15 parameters investigated, we find that\n$g-r$ colour, followed by stellar mass surface density, bulge fraction and\nspecific star formation rate have the best connection with \\fgas. By combining\ntwo control parameters, that indicate how well a given galaxy in SDSS is\nrepresented by the ALFALFA training set (\\pr) and the scatter in the training\nprocedure (\\sigf), we develop a strategy for quantifying which SDSS galaxies\nour ANN can be adequately applied to, and the associated errors in the \\fgas\\\nestimation. In contrast to previous works, our \\fgas\\ estimation has no\nsystematic trend with galactic parameters such as M$_{\\star}$, $g-r$ and SFR.\nWe present a catalog of \\fgas\\ estimates for more than half a million galaxies\nin the SDSS, of which $\\sim$ 150,000 galaxies have a secure selection parameter\nwith average scatter in the \\fgas\\ estimation of 0.22 dex.\n", "  We study the generation and propagation of local perturbations in a quantum\nmany-body spin system. In particular, we study the Ising model in transverse\nfield in the presence of a local field defect at one edge. This system\npossesses a rich phase diagram with different regions characterized by the\npresence of one or two Majorana zero modes. We show that their localized\ncharacter {\\it i}) enables a characterization of the Ising phase transition\nthrough a local-only measurement performed on the edge spin, and {\\it ii})\nstrongly affects the propagation of quasiparticles emitted after the sudden\nremoval of the defect, so that the dynamics of the local magnetization show\nclear deviations from a ballistic behavior in presence of the Majorana\nfermions.\n", "  In this paper we report on a long multi-wavelength observational campaign of\nthe supergiant fast X-ray transient prototype IGR J17544-2619. A 150 ks-long\nobservation was carried out simultaneously with XMM-Newton and NuSTAR, catching\nthe source in an initial faint X-ray state and then undergoing a bright X-ray\noutburst lasting about 7 ks. We studied the spectral variability during\noutburst and quiescence by using a thermal and bulk Comptonization model that\nis typically adopted to describe the X-ray spectral energy distribution of\nyoung pulsars in high mass X-ray binaries. Although the statistics of the\ncollected X-ray data were relatively high we could neither confirm the presence\nof a cyclotron line in the broad-band spectrum of the source (0.5-40 keV), nor\ndetect any of the previously reported tentative detection of the source spin\nperiod. The monitoring carried out with Swift/XRT during the same orbit of the\nsystem observed by XMM-Newton and NuSTAR revealed that the source remained in a\nlow emission state for most of the time, in agreement with the known property\nof all supergiant fast X-ray transients being significantly sub-luminous\ncompared to other supergiant X-ray binaries. Optical and infrared observations\nwere carried out for a total of a few thousands of seconds during the\nquiescence state of the source detected by XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. The measured\noptical and infrared magnitudes were slightly lower than previous values\nreported in the literature, but compatible with the known micro-variability of\nsupergiant stars. UV observations obtained with the UVOT telescope on-board\nSwift did not reveal significant changes in the magnitude of the source in this\nenergy domain compared to previously reported values.\n", "  In Jupiter's stratosphere, gaseous carbon monosulfide (CS) was first\ndiscovered in 1994 by millimeter and ultraviolet observations as a product\ninduced by the collision of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 (SL9). {To constrain sulfur\nchemistry, in 2013, 19 years after the SL9 event, we observed Jupiter's\nstratospheric CS $J$=7 -- 6 rotational transition at 0.8 mm wavelength by using\nthe Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE) 10-m single dish\ntelescope. The CS molecular line was successfully detected with 120 mK\nintensity in the antenna temperature scale. The obtained CS total mass shows\n$\\sim$90$\\%$ decrease relative to that observed in 1998. From the line shape\nanalysis, CS is suggested to be present above the 0.2$^{+0.4}_{-0.15}$ mbar\npressure level, which is comparable to that of determined in 1998 which was\nprovided by SL9 along with CS, was observed up to the 2.0 mbar pressure region.\nThe discrepancy of CS vertical distribution with \\ce{H2O} and the decrease in\nits total mass may be attributed to the chemical loss of CS in Jupiter's\nstratosphere lower than the 0.2 mbar altitude region.\n", "  To search for a signature of an intracluster magnetic field, we compare\nmeasurements of Faraday rotation of polarised extragalactic radio sources in\nthe line of sight of galaxy clusters with those outside. We correlated a\ncatalogue of 1383 rotation measures (RM) of extragalactic polarised radio\nsources with X-ray luminous galaxy clusters from the CLASSIX survey (combining\nREFLEX II and NORAS II). We compared the RM in the line of sight of clusters\nwithin their projected radii of r_500 with those outside and found a\nsignificant excess of the dispersion of the RM in the cluster regions. Since\nthe observed RM is the result of Faraday rotation in several presumably\nuncorrelated magnetised cells of the intracluster medium, the observations\ncorrespond to quantities averaged over several magnetic field directions and\nstrengths. Therefore the interesting quantity is the standard deviation of the\nRM for an ensemble of clusters. We found a standard deviation of the RM inside\nr_500 of about 120 +- 21 rad m^-2. This compares to about 56 +- 8 rad m^-2\noutside. We show that the most X-ray luminous and thus most massive clusters\ncontribute most to the observed excess RM. Modelling the electron density\ndistribution in the intracluster medium with a self-similar model, we found\nthat the dispersion of the RM increases with the column density, and we deduce\na magnetic field value of about 2 - 6 (l/10kpc)^-1/2 microG assuming a constant\nmagnetic field strength, where l is the size of the coherently magnetised\nintracluster medium cells. This magnetic field energy density amounts to a few\npercent of the average thermal energy density in clusters. When we assumed the\nmagnetic energy density to be a constant fraction of the thermal energy\ndensity, we deduced a slightly lower value for this fraction of 3 - 10\n(l/10kpc)^-1/2 per mille.\n", "  We investigate the numerical values of the low-energy constants in the chiral\neffective Lagrangian for the interactions between the charmed mesons and the\nlightest pseudoscalar mesons, the Goldstone bosons of the spontaneous breaking\nof chiral symmetry for QCD. This problem is tackled from two sides: estimates\nusing the resonance exchange model, and positivity constraints from the general\nproperties of the $S$-matrix including analyticity, crossing symmetry and\nunitarity. These estimates and constraints are compared with the values\ndetermined from fits to lattice data of the scattering lengths. Tensions are\nfound, and possible reasons are discussed. We conclude that more data from\nlattice calculations and experiments are necessary to fix these constants\nbetter. As a by-product, we also estimate the coupling constant $g_{DDa_2}$,\nwith $a_2$ the light tensor meson, via the QCD sum rule approach.\n", "  With the aim of improving our knowledge about the nature of the progenitors\nof low-luminosity Type II plateau supernovae (LL SNe IIP), we made\nradiation-hydrodynamical models of the well-sampled LL SNe IIP 2003Z, 2008bk\nand 2009md. For these three SNe we infer explosion energies of $0.16$-$0.18$\nfoe, radii at explosion of $1.8$-$3.5 \\times 10^{13}$ cm, and ejected masses of\n$10$-$11.3$\\Msun. The estimated progenitor mass on the main sequence is in the\nrange $\\sim 13.2$-$15.1$\\Msun\\, for SN 2003Z and $\\sim 11.4$-$12.9$\\Msun\\, for\nSNe 2008bk and 2009md, in agreement with estimates from observations of the\nprogenitors. These results together with those for other LL SNe IIP modelled in\nthe same way, enable us also to conduct a comparative study on this SN\nsub-group. The results suggest that: a) the progenitors of faint SNe IIP are\nslightly less massive and have less energetic explosions than those of\nintermediate-luminosity SNe IIP, b) both faint and intermediate-luminosity SNe\nIIP originate from low-energy explosions of red (or yellow) supergiant stars of\nlow-to-intermediate mass, c) some faint objects may also be explained as\nelectron-capture SNe from massive super-asymptotic giant branch stars, and d)\nLL SNe IIP form the underluminous tail of the SNe IIP family, where the main\nparameter \"guiding\" the distribution seems to be the ratio of the total\nexplosion energy to the ejected mass. Further hydrodynamical studies should be\nperformed and compared to a more extended sample of LL SNe IIP before drawing\nany conclusion on the relevance of fall-back to this class of events.\n", "  Observations of stellar clusters have had a tremendous impact in forming our\nunderstanding of stellar evolution. The open cluster M67 has a particularly\nimportant role as a calibration benchmark for stellar evolution theory due to\nits near solar composition and age. As a result, it has been observed\nextensively, including attempts to detect solar-like oscillations in its main\nsequence and red giant stars. However, any asteroseismic inference has so far\nremained elusive due to the difficulty in measuring these extremely low\namplitude oscillations. Here we report the first unambiguous detection of\nsolar-like oscillations in the red giants of M67. We use data from the Kepler\necliptic mission, K2, to measure the global asteroseismic properties. We find a\nmodel-independent seismic-informed distance of 816+/-11pc, or\n(m-M)o=9.57+/-0.03mag, an average red-giant mass of 1.36+/-0.01Msun, in\nagreement with the dynamical mass from an eclipsing binary near the cluster\nturn-off, and ages of individual stars compatible with isochrone fitting. We\nsee no evidence of strong mass loss on the red giant branch. We also determine\nseismic log g of all the cluster giants with a typical precision of ~0.01dex.\nOur results generally show good agreement with independent methods and support\nthe use of seismic scaling relations to determine global properties of red\ngiant stars with near solar metallicity. We further illustrate that the data\nare of such high quality, that future work on individual mode frequencies\nshould be possible, which would extend the scope of seismic analysis of this\ncluster.\n", "  We present the data release paper for the Galaxy Zoo: Hubble (GZH) project.\nThis is the third phase in a large effort to measure reliable, detailed\nmorphologies of galaxies by using crowdsourced visual classifications of colour\ncomposite images. Images in GZH were selected from various publicly-released\nHubble Space Telescope Legacy programs conducted with the Advanced Camera for\nSurveys, with filters that probe the rest-frame optical emission from galaxies\nout to $z \\sim 1$. The bulk of the sample is selected to have $m_{I814W} <\n23.5$,but goes as faint as $m_{I814W} < 26.8$ for deep images combined over 5\nepochs. The median redshift of the combined samples is $z = 0.9 \\pm 0.6$, with\na tail extending out to $z \\sim 4$. The GZH morphological data include\nmeasurements of both bulge- and disk-dominated galaxies, details on spiral disk\nstructure that relate to the Hubble type, bar identification, and numerous\nmeasurements of clump identification and geometry. This paper also describes a\nnew method for calibrating morphologies for galaxies of different luminosities\nand at different redshifts by using artificially-redshifted galaxy images as a\nbaseline. The GZH catalogue contains both raw and calibrated morphological vote\nfractions for 119,849 galaxies, providing the largest dataset to date suitable\nfor large-scale studies of galaxy evolution out to $z \\sim 1$.\n", "  We present quantified visual morphologies of approximately 48,000 galaxies\nobserved in three Hubble Space Telescope legacy fields by the Cosmic And\nNear-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) and classified by\nparticipants in the Galaxy Zoo project. 90% of galaxies have z < 3 and are\nobserved in rest-frame optical wavelengths by CANDELS. Each galaxy received an\naverage of 40 independent classifications, which we combine into detailed\nmorphological information on galaxy features such as clumpiness, bar\ninstabilities, spiral structure, and merger and tidal signatures. We apply a\nconsensus-based classifier weighting method that preserves classifier\nindependence while effectively down-weighting significantly outlying\nclassifications. After analysing the effect of varying image depth on reported\nclassifications, we also provide depth-corrected classifications which both\npreserve the information in the deepest observations and also enable the use of\nclassifications at comparable depths across the full survey. Comparing the\nGalaxy Zoo classifications to previous classifications of the same galaxies\nshows very good agreement; for some applications the high number of independent\nclassifications provided by Galaxy Zoo provides an advantage in selecting\ngalaxies with a particular morphological profile, while in others the\ncombination of Galaxy Zoo with other classifications is a more promising\napproach than using any one method alone. We combine the Galaxy Zoo\nclassifications of \"smooth\" galaxies with parametric morphologies to select a\nsample of featureless disks at 1 < z < 3, which may represent a dynamically\nwarmer progenitor population to the settled disk galaxies seen at later epochs.\n", "  Atomic data and plasma models play a crucial role in the diagnosis and\ninterpretation of astrophysical spectra, thus influencing our understanding of\nthe universe. In this investigation we present a systematic comparison of the\nleading photoionisation codes to determine how much their intrinsic differences\nimpact X-ray spectroscopic studies of hot plasmas in photoionisation\nequilibrium. We carry out our computations using the Cloudy, SPEX, and XSTAR\nphotoionisation codes, and compare their derived thermal and ionisation states\nfor various ionising spectral energy distributions. We examine the resulting\nabsorption-line spectra from these codes for the case of ionised outflows in\nactive galactic nuclei. By comparing the ionic abundances as a function of\nionisation parameter $\\xi$, we find that on average there is about 30%\ndeviation between the codes in $\\xi$ where ionic abundances peak. For H-like to\nB-like sequence ions alone, this deviation in $\\xi$ is smaller at about 10% on\naverage. The comparison of the absorption-line spectra in the X-ray band shows\nthat there is on average about 30% deviation between the codes in the optical\ndepth of the lines produced at log $\\xi$ ~ 1 to 2, reducing to about 20%\ndeviation at log $\\xi$ ~ 3. We also simulate spectra of the ionised outflows\nwith the current and upcoming high-resolution X-ray spectrometers, on board\nXMM-Newton, Chandra, Hitomi, and Athena. From these simulations we obtain the\ndeviation on the best-fit model parameters, arising from the use of different\nphotoionisation codes, which is about 10 to 40%. We compare the modelling\nuncertainties with the observational uncertainties from the simulations. The\nresults highlight the importance of continuous development and enhancement of\nphotoionisation codes for the upcoming era of X-ray astronomy with Athena.\n", "  Electron tunneling spectroscopy measurements on van der Waals\nheterostructures consisting of metal and graphene (or graphite) electrodes\nseparated by atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride tunnel barriers are\nreported. The tunneling conductance dI/dV at low voltages is relatively weak,\nwith a strong enhancement reproducibly observed to occur at around |V| ~ 50 mV.\nWhile the weak tunneling at low energies is attributed to the absence of\nsubstantial overlap, in momentum space, of the metal and graphene Fermi\nsurfaces, the enhancement at higher energies signals the onset of inelastic\nprocesses in which phonons in the heterostructure provide the momentum\nnecessary to link the Fermi surfaces. Pronounced peaks in the second derivative\nof the tunnel current, are observed at voltages where known phonon modes in the\ntunnel junction have a high density of states. In addition, features in the\ntunneling conductance attributed to single electron charging of nanometer-scale\ndefects in the boron nitride are also observed in these devices. The small\nelectronic density of states of graphene allows the charging spectra of these\ndefect states to be electrostatically tuned, leading to Coulomb diamonds in the\ntunneling conductance.\n", "  Based on an extended multiphase transport model, which includes mean-field\npotentials in both the partonic and hadronic phases, uses the mix-event\ncoalescence, and respects charge conservation during the hadronic evolution, we\nhave studied the collision energy dependence of the elliptic flow splitting\nbetween particles and their antiparticles. This extended transport model\nreproduces reasonably well the experimental data at lower collision energies\nbut only describes qualitatively the elliptic flow splitting at higher beam\nenergies. The present study thus indicates the existence of other mechanisms\nfor the elliptic flow splitting besides the mean-field potentials and the need\nof further improvements of the multiphase transport model.\n", "  We combine simultaneous constraints on stellar evolutionary status from\nasteroseismology, and on nitrogen abundances derived from large spectroscopic\nsurveys, to follow nitrogen surface abundances all along the evolution of a\nlow-mass star, comparing model expectations with data. After testing and\ncalibrating the observed yields from the APOGEE survey, we first show that\nnitrogen surface abundances follow the expected trend after the first dredge-up\noccurred, i.e. that the more massive is the star the more nitrogen is enhanced.\nMoreover, the behaviour of nitrogen data along the evolution confirms the\nexistence of non-canonical extra-mixing on the RGB for all low-mass stars in\nthe field. But more surprisingly, the data indicate that nitrogen has been\ndepleted between the RGB tip and the red clump. This may suggest that some\nnitrogen has been burnt near or at the He flash episode.\n", "  We investigate the evolution of the galaxy Star Formation Rate Function\n(SFRF) and Cosmic Star Formation Rate Density (CSFRD) of $z\\sim 1-4 $ galaxies,\nusing cosmological Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations and a\ncompilation of UV, IR and H$\\alpha$ observations. These tracers represent\ndifferent populations of galaxies with the IR light being a probe of objects\nwith high star formation rates and dust contents, while UV and H$\\alpha$\nobservations provide a census of low star formation galaxies where mild\nobscuration occurs. We compare the above SFRFs with the results of SPH\nsimulations run with the code {\\small{P-GADGET3(XXL)}}. We focus on the role of\nfeedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and supernovae in form of galactic\nwinds. The AGN feedback prescription that we use decreases the simulated CSFRD\nat $z < 3$ but is not sufficient to reproduce the observed evolution at higher\nredshifts. We explore different wind models and find that the key factor for\nreproducing the evolution of the observed SFRF and CSFRD at $z \\sim1-4$ is the\npresence of a feedback prescription that is prominent at high redshifts ($z \\ge\n4$) and becomes less efficient with time. We show that variable galactic winds\nwhich are efficient at decreasing the SFRs of low mass objects are quite\nsuccessful in reproducing the observables.\n", "  Recent measurements of the dark matter halo masses of infrared-selected\nobscured quasars are in tension --- some indicate that obscured quasars have\nhigher halo mass compared to their unobscured counterparts, while others find\nno difference. The former result is inconsistent with the simplest models of\nquasar unification that rely solely on viewing angle, while the latter may\nsupport such models. Here, using empirical relationships between dark matter\nhalo and supermassive black hole masses, we provide a simple evolutionary\npicture that naturally explains these findings and is motivated by more\nsophisticated merger-driven quasar fueling models. The model tracks the growth\nrate of haloes, with the black hole growing in spurts of quasar activity in\norder to \"catch-up\" with the $M_{\\textrm{BH}}$ - $M_{\\textrm{star}}$ -\n$M_{\\textrm{halo}}$ relationship. The first part of the quasar phase is\nobscured and is followed by an unobscured phase. Depending on the luminosity\nlimit of the sample, driven by observational selection effects, a difference in\nhalo masses may or may not be significant. For high luminosity samples, the\ndifference can be large (a few to 10 times higher masses in obscured quasars),\nwhile for lower luminosity samples the halo mass difference is very small, much\nsmaller than current observational constraints. Such a simple model provides a\nqualitative explanation for the higher mass haloes of obscured quasars, as well\nas rough quantitative agreement with seemingly disparate results.\n", "  The active galaxy MCG--6-30-15 has a 400 pc diameter stellar kinematically\ndistinct core, counter-rotating with respect to the main body of the galaxy.\nOur previous high spatial resolution (0\".1) H-band observations of this galaxy\nmapped the stellar kinematics and [Fe II] 1.64 {\\mu}m gas dynamics though\nmainly restricted to the spatial region of the counter-rotating core. In this\nwork we probe the stellar kinematics on a larger field-of-view and determine\nthe ionised and molecular gas dynamics to study the formation of the\ncounter-rotating core and the implications for AGN fuelling. We present\nintegral field spectroscopy observations with SINFONI in the H and K-bands in\nthe central 1.2 kpc and with VIMOS HR-blue in the central 4 kpc of the galaxy.\nIonised gas outflows of v ~ 100 km/s are traced by the [Ca VIII] 2.32 {\\mu}m\ncoronal line and extend out to at least a radius of r ~ 140 pc. The molecular\ngas, traced by the H2 2.12 {\\mu}m emission is also counter rotating with\nrespect to the main body of the galaxy, indicating that the formation of the\ndistinct core was associated with inflow of external gas into the centre of\nMCG--6-30-15. The molecular gas traces the available gas reservoir for AGN\nfuelling and is detected as close as r ~ 50 - 100 pc. External gas accretion is\nable to significantly replenish the fuelling reservoir suggesting that the\nevent that formed the counter-rotating core was also the main mechanism\nproviding gas for AGN fuelling.\n", "  We present observations of the Cepheus Flare obtained as part of the James\nClerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) Gould Belt Legacy Survey (GBLS) with the SCUBA-2\ninstrument. We produce a catalogue of sources found by SCUBA-2, and separate\nthese into starless cores and protostars. We determine masses and densities for\neach of our sources, using source temperatures determined by the Herschel Gould\nBelt Survey. We compare the properties of starless cores in four different\nmolecular clouds: L1147/58, L1172/74, L1251 and L1228. We find that the core\nmass functions for each region typically show shallower-than-Salpeter\nbehaviour. We find that L1147/58 and L1228 have a high ratio of starless cores\nto Class II protostars, while L1251 and L1174 have a low ratio, consistent with\nthe latter regions being more active sites of current star formation, while the\nformer are forming stars less actively. We determine that, if modelled as\nthermally-supported Bonnor-Ebert spheres, most of our cores have stable\nconfigurations accessible to them. We estimate the external pressures on our\ncores using archival $^{13}$CO velocity dispersion measurements and find that\nour cores are typically pressure-confined, rather than gravitationally bound.\nWe perform a virial analysis on our cores, and find that they typically cannot\nbe supported against collapse by internal thermal energy alone, due primarily\nto the measured external pressures. This suggests that the dominant mode of\ninternal support in starless cores in the Cepheus Flare is either non-thermal\nmotions or internal magnetic fields.\n", "  We report systematic Angle Resolved Photoemission (ARPES) experiments using\ndifferent photon polarizations and experimental geometries and find that the\ndoping evolution of the normal state of Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 deviates significantly\nfrom the predictions of a rigid band model. The data reveal a non-monotonic\ndependence upon doping of key quantities such as band filling, bandwidth of the\nelectron pocket, and quasiparticle coherence. Our analysis suggests that the\nobserved phenomenology and the inapplicability of the rigid band model in\nCo-doped Ba122 are due to electronic correlations, and not to either the size\nof the impurity potential, or self-energy effects due to impurity scattering.\nOur findings indicate that the effects of doping in pnictides are much more\ncomplicated than currently believed. More generally, they indicate that a deep\nunderstanding of the evolution of the electronic properties of the normal\nstate, which requires an understanding of the doping process, remains elusive\neven for the 122 iron-pnictides, which are viewed as the least correlated of\nthe high-TC unconventional superconductors.\n", "  To detect stellar activity cycles and study the possible star-planet\ninteractions (SPI's), we have developed both HK$\\alpha$ and SPI-HK$\\alpha$\nprojects since 1999 and 2012 respectively.\n  In this work, we present preliminary results of possible SPI's studying the\nchromospheric activity and look for possible correlations between stellar\nactivity and stellar/planetary parameters. We find that for stars with similar\nT$_{eff}$, stellar activity increases with the mass of the planet, similar to\nprevious works. However, stellar ages can also play a role and a larger stellar\nsample is needed to verify these trends. We also note that some of these stars\npresent a remarkably high level of chromospheric activity, even comparable with\nRSCvn or BY Dra active stars. In addition, we do not observe any correlation\nbetween stellar activity and semi-major axis.\n  We present the first long-term activity study of the star $\\iota$ Horologii,\na young solar-type star which hosts a non-transiting Jovian planet and presents\na high activity level. We analyze our own spectra, obtained between 2002 and\n2015, combined with public HARPS observations. We calculate the Ca II indexes\nderived from the 987 CASLEO and HARPS spectra and convert them to the\nMount-Wilson scale. We found a long-term activity cycle of $\\sim$ 5 years which\nfits the active sequence of Bohm-Vitense. The amplitude of this longer cycle is\nirregular, as was also observed for the shorter one. This fact could be\nattributed to an antisymmetric distribution of active regions on the stellar\nsurface.\n", "  We present a joint analysis of the four most prominent sodium-sensitive\nfeatures (NaD, NaI8190, NaI1.14, and NaI2.21), in the optical and Near-Infrared\nspectral range, of two nearby, massive (sigma~300km/s), early-type galaxies\n(named XSG1 and XSG2). Our analysis relies on deep VLT/X-Shooter long-slit\nspectra, along with newly developed stellar population models, allowing for\n[Na/Fe] variations, up to 1.2dex, over a wide range of age, total metallicity,\nand IMF slope. The new models show that the response of the Na-dependent\nspectral indices to [Na/Fe] is stronger when the IMF is bottom heavier. For the\nfirst time, we are able to match all four Na features in the central regions of\nmassive early-type galaxies, finding an overabundance of [Na/Fe], in the range\n0.5-0.7dex, and a bottom-heavy IMF. Therefore, individual abundance variations\ncannot be fully responsible for the trends of gravity-sensitive indices,\nstrengthening the case towards a non-universal IMF. Given current limitations\nof theoretical atmosphere models, our [Na/Fe] estimates should be taken as\nupper limits. For XSG1, where line strengths are measured out to 0.8Re, the\nradial trend of [Na/Fe] is similar to [Mg/Fe] and [C/Fe], being constant out to\n0.5Re, and decreasing by 0.2-0.3dex at 0.8Re, without any clear correlation\nwith local metallicity. Such a result seems to be in contrast with the\npredicted increase of Na nucleosynthetic yields from AGB stars and TypeII SNe.\nFor XSG1, the Na-inferred IMF radial profile is consistent, within the errors,\nwith that derived from TiO features and the Wing-Ford band, presented in a\nrecent paper.\n", "  Combined studies of variable stars and stellar clusters open great horizons,\nand they allow us to improve our understanding of stellar cluster formation and\nstellar evolution. In that prospect, the Gaia mission will provide astrometric,\nphotometric, and spectroscopic data for about one billion stars of the Milky\nWay. This will represent a major census of stellar clusters, and it will\ndrastically increase the number of known variable stars. In particular, the\npeculiar Gaia scanning law offers the opportunity to investigate the rather\nunexplored domain of short timescale variability (from tens of seconds to a\ndozen of hours), bringing invaluable clues to the fields of stellar physics and\nstellar aggregates. We assess the Gaia capabilities in terms of short timescale\nvariability detection, using extensive light-curve simulations for various\nvariable object types. We show that Gaia can detect periodic variability\nphenomena with amplitude variations larger than a few millimagnitudes.\nAdditionally, we plan to perform subsequent follow-up of variables stars\ndetected in clusters by Gaia to better characterize them. Hence, we develop a\npipeline for the analysis of high cadence photometry from ground-based\ntelescopes such as the 1.2m Euler telescope (La Silla, Chile) and the 1.2m\nMercator telescope (La Palma, Canary Islands).\n", "  We report the results of a six-month Swift monitoring campaign of Ark120, a\nprototypical bare Seyfert1 galaxy. The lack of intrinsic absorption combined\nwith the nearly contemporaneous coverage of the UV and X-ray bands makes it\npossible to investigate the link between the accretion disk and the\nComptonization corona. Our observations confirm the presence of substantial\ntemporal variability, with the X-rays characterized by large-amplitude flux\nchanges on timescales of few days, while the variations in the UV bands are\nsmoother on timescales of several weeks. The source also shows spectral\nvariability with the X-ray spectrum steepening when the source is brighter. We\ndo not detect any correlation between the UV flux and the X-ray spectral slope.\nA cross correlation analysis suggests positive delays between X-rays and the UV\nemission, favoring a scenario of disk reprocessing. Although the strength of\nthe correlation is moderate with a delay not well constrained (7.5+-7 days), it\nis nevertheless indicative of a large disk reprocessing region, with a\nseparation between the X-ray and the UV emitting regions of the order of 1000\nrG. The Ark120 correlation results are in agreement with those obtained in\nsimilar monitoring studies. When combined together, the observations can be\nwell described by a linear relation between the X-ray/UV delay and the black\nhole mass. Within the context of the simplest scenario where these delays\ncorrespond to light-travel times, the implied distance between the X-ray source\nand the UV disk reprocessing region is of the order of many hundreds of\ngravitational radii.\n", "  The solar-cyle variation of acoustic mode frequencies has a frequency\ndependence related to the inverse mode inertia. The discrepancy between model\npredictions and measured oscillation frequencies for solar and solar-type\nstellar acoustic modes includes a significant frequency-dependent term known as\nthe surface term that is also related to the inverse mode inertia. We\nparametrize both the surface term and the frequency variations for low-degree\nsolar data from Birmingham Solar-Oscillations Network (BiSON) and medium-degree\ndata from the Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) using the mode inertia\ntogether with cubic and inverse frequency terms. We find that for the central\nfrequency of rotationally split multiplets the cubic term dominates both the\naverage surface term and the temporal variation, but for the medium-degree case\nthe inverse term improves the fit to the temporal variation. We also examine\nthe variation of the even-order splitting coefficients for the medium-degree\ndata and find that, as for the central frequency, the latitude-dependent\nfrequency variation, which reflects the changing latitudinal distribution of\nmagnetic activity over the solar cycle, can be described by the combination of\na cubic and an inverse function of frequency scaled by inverse mode inertia.\nThe results suggest that this simple parametrization could be used to assess\nthe activity-related frequency variation in solar-like asteroseismic targets.\n", "  We study the stability of spatially flat FRW solutions which are geodesically\ncomplete, i.e. for which one can follow null (graviton) geodesics both in the\npast and in the future without ever encountering singularities. This is the\ncase of NEC-violating cosmologies such as smooth bounces or solutions which\napproach Minkowski in the past. We study the EFT of linear perturbations around\na solution of this kind, including the possibility of multiple fields and\nfluids. One generally faces a gradient instability which can be avoided only if\nthe operator $~^{(3)}{R} \\delta N~$ is present and its coefficient changes sign\nalong the evolution. This operator (typical of beyond-Horndeski theories) does\nnot lead to extra degrees of freedom, but cannot arise starting from any theory\nwith second-order equations of motion. The change of sign of this operator\nprevents to set it to zero with a generalised disformal transformation.\n", "  We numerically investigate the interior of a four-dimensional, asymptotically\nflat, spherically symmetric charged black hole perturbed by a scalar field\n$\\Phi$. Previous study by Marolf and Ori indicated that late infalling\nobservers will encounter an effective shock wave as they approach the left\nportion of the inner horizon. This shock manifests itself as a sudden change in\nthe values of various fields, within a tremendously short interval of proper\ntime $\\tau$ of the infalling observers. We confirm this prediction numerically\nfor both test and self-gravitating scalar field perturbations. In both cases we\ndemonstrate the effective shock in the scalar field by exploring $\\Phi(\\tau)$\nalong a family of infalling timelike geodesics. In the self-gravitating case we\nalso demonstrate the shock in the area coordinate $r$ by exploring $r(\\tau)$.\nWe confirm the theoretical prediction concerning the shock sharpening rate,\nwhich is exponential in the time of infall into the black hole. In addition we\nnumerically probe the early stages of shock formation. We also employ a family\nof null (rather than timelike) ingoing geodesics to probe the shock in $r$. We\nuse a finite-difference numerical code with double-null coordinates combined\nwith a recently developed adaptive gauge method in order to solve the (Einstein\n+ scalar) field equations and to evolve the spacetime (and scalar field) $ - $\nfrom the region outside the black hole down to the vicinity of the Cauchy\nhorizon and the spacelike $r=0$ singularity.\n", "  A large observation programme was carried out to measure the radial\nvelocities of the components of a selection of common proper motion (CPM)\nstars, in order to select the physical binaries. Eighty wide binaries (WBs)\nwere detected, and 39 optical pairs were identified. Adding CPM stars with\nseparations close enough to be almost certain they are physical, a\n\"bias-controlled\" sample of 116 wide binaries was obtained, and used to derive\nthe distribution of separations from 100 to 30,000 au. The distribution\nobtained doesn't match the log-constant distribution, but is in agreement with\nthe log-normal distribution. The spectroscopic binaries detected among the WB\ncomponents were used to derive statistical informations about the multiple\nsystems. The close binaries in WBs seem to be similar to those detected in\nother field stars. As for the WBs, they seem to obey the log-normal\ndistribution of periods. The number of quadruple systems is in agreement with\nthe \"no correlation\" hypothesis; this indicates that an environment conducive\nto the formation of WBs doesn't favor the formation of subsystems with periods\nshorter than 10 years.\n", "  Recognizing whether a planet can support life is a primary goal of future\nexoplanet spectral characterization missions, but past research on habitability\nassessment has largely ignored the vastly different conditions that have\nexisted in our planet's long habitable history. This study presents simulations\nof a habitable yet dramatically different phase of Earth's history, when the\natmosphere contained a Titan-like organic-rich haze. Prior work has claimed a\nhaze-rich Archean Earth (3.8-2.5 billion years ago) would be frozen due to the\nhaze's cooling effects. However, no previous studies have self-consistently\ntaken into account climate, photochemistry, and fractal hazes. Here, we\ndemonstrate using coupled climate-photochemical-microphysical simulations that\nhazes can cool the planet's surface by about 20 K, but habitable conditions\nwith liquid surface water could be maintained with a relatively thick haze\nlayer (tau ~ 5 at 200 nm) even with the fainter young sun. We find that\noptically thicker hazes are self-limiting due to their self-shielding\nproperties, preventing catastrophic cooling of the planet. Hazes may even\nenhance planetary habitability through UV shielding, reducing surface UV flux\nby about 97% compared to a haze-free planet, and potentially allowing survival\nof land-based organisms 2.6.2.7 billion years ago. The broad UV absorption\nsignature produced by this haze may be visible across interstellar distances,\nallowing characterization of similar hazy exoplanets. The haze in Archean\nEarth's atmosphere was strongly dependent on biologically-produced methane, and\nwe propose hydrocarbon haze may be a novel type of spectral biosignature on\nplanets with substantial levels of CO2. Hazy Archean Earth is the most alien\nworld for which we have geochemical constraints on environmental conditions,\nproviding a useful analog for similar habitable, anoxic exoplanets.\n", "  The kinematics and stellar populations of the low-mass nearby S0 galaxy NGC\n5102 are studied from integral field spectra taken with the Multi-Unit\nSpectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). The kinematic maps reveal for the first time\nthat NGC 5102 has the characteristic 2 sigma peaks indicative of galaxies with\ncounter-rotating discs. This interpretation is quantitatively confirmed by\nfitting two kinematic components to the observed spectra. Through stellar\npopulation analysis we confirm the known young stellar population in the centre\nand find steep age and metallicity gradients. We construct axisymmetric Jeans\nanisotropic models of the stellar dynamics to investigate the initial mass\nfunction (IMF) and the dark matter halo of the galaxy. The models show that\nthis galaxy is quite different from all galaxies previously studied with a\nsimilar approach: even within the half-light radius, it cannot be approximated\nwith the self-consistent mass-follows-light assumption. Including an NFW dark\nmatter halo, we need a heavy IMF and a dark matter fraction of 0.37+-0.04\nwithin a sphere of one effective radius to describe the stellar kinematics. The\nmore general model with a free slope of the dark matter halo shows that slope\nand IMF are degenerate, but indicates that a light weight IMF (Chabrier-like)\nand a higher dark matter fraction, with a steeper (contracted) halo, fit the\ndata better. Regardless of the assumptions about the halo profile, we measure\nthe slope of the total mass density to be -1.75+-0.04. This is shallower than\nthe slope of -2 of an isothermal halo and shallower than published slopes for\nmore massive early type galaxies.\n", "  We study the mass accretion histories (MAHs) and density profiles of dark\nmatter halos using N-body simulations of self-similar gravitational clustering\nfrom scale-free power spectra, $P(k)\\propto k^n$. We pay particular attention\nto the density profile curvature, which we characterize using the shape\nparameter, $\\alpha$, of an Einasto profile. In agreement with previous findings\nour results suggest that, despite vast differences in their MAHs, the density\nprofiles of virialized halos are remarkably alike. Nonetheless, clear\ndepartures from self-similarity are evident: for a given spectral index,\n$\\alpha$ increases slightly but systematically with \"peak height\",\n$\\nu\\equiv\\delta_{sc}/\\sigma(M,z)$, regardless of mass or redshift. More\nimportantly, however, the \"$\\alpha-\\nu$\" relation depends on $n$: the steeper\nthe initial power spectrum, the more gradual the curvature of both the mean\nMAHs and mean density profiles. These results are consistent with previous\nfindings connecting the shapes of halo mass profiles and MAHs and imply that\ndark matter halos are not structurally self-similar but, through the merger\nhistory, retain a memory of the linear density field from which they form.\n", "  Precision uvbyCa Hbeta photometry of the metal-deficient, old open cluster,\nNGC 2506, is presented. The survey covers an area 20 by 20 arcminutes, and\nextends to V~18 for b-y and Hbeta and to V~17.0 for c_1 and hk. For V < 16.0,\nphotometric scatter among the indices leads to the recovery of 6 known\nvariables within the cluster core and 5 new variables in the outer 5 arcmin of\nthe survey field. Proper motions, radial velocities, and precise multicolor\nindices are used to isolate a highly probable sample of cluster members from\nthe very rich color-magnitude diagram (CMD). From 257 highly probable members\nat the cluster turnoff, we derive a reddening estimate of E(b-y) = 0.042 +/-\n0.001 (E(B-V) = 0.058 +/- 0.001), where the errors refer to the internal\nstandard errors of the mean. [Fe/H] is derived from the A/F dwarf members using\nboth m_1 and hk, leading to [Fe/H] = -0.296 +/- 0.011 (sem) and -0.317 +/-\n0.004 (sem), respectively. The weighted average, heavily dominated by hk, is\n[Fe/H] = -0.316 +/- 0.033. Based upon red giant members, we place an upper\nlimit of +/- 0.010 on the variation in the reddening across the face of the\ncluster. We also identify two dozen potential red giant cluster members outside\nthe cluster core. Victoria-Regina isochrones on the Stromgren system produce an\nexcellent match to the cluster for an apparent modulus of (m-M) = 12.75 +/- 0.1\nand an age of 1.85 +/- 0.05 Gyr.\n", "  We present the results of UBVRI polarimetry of the TeV gamma-ray binary HESS\nJ0632+057 obtained on 2015 March 24 (JD 2457106) and 2015 December 12 (JD\n2457369). The detected polarisation values of HESS J0632+057, just after\nperiastron passage (March 24), are higher than all previously published values\n(p(V) ~ 4.2%) and the position angle (theta ~ 171-172 degrees) is also\ndifferent by ~6-10 degrees from previously published values. The data obtained\njust before the subsequent periastron passage (December 12) show statistically\nlower polarisation in all photometric bands (p(V) ~ 3.9%) and a different\nposition angle theta ~ 167-168 degrees. From observations of a nearby field\nstar, the interstellar component of the measured polarisation was estimated as\np_is(V) ~ 0.65% and theta_is ~ 153 degrees. This estimate was used with the\nprevious \"V\"-band estimation by \"field-stars method\" (p(V) ~ 2% and theta_is ~\n165 degrees) of Yudin (2014) to identify the wavelength dependence of the\nintrinsic polarisation in HESS J0632+057. It was found that after subtraction\nof the interstellar component (for both p_is estimates), the wavelength\ndependence of the intrinsic polarisation in HESS J0632+057 is essentially flat.\nWe propose that the formation of an additional source of polarisation or some\nperturbation of circumstellar material at this orbital phase can explain the\nchanges in the level of polarisation in HESS J0632+057 close to periastron\npassage.\n", "  We propose a novel technique to efficiently excite a surface plasmon\npolariton (SPP) mode at a gold-glass interface by exploiting the near field\nexcitation of an engineered high index (silicon) gabled tip at the telecom\nwavelengths. The proposed structure can theoretically convert 49% of the input\noptical power to a SPP mode. The device is compact, it will facilitate the\non-chip excitation of the SPP, its fabrication is compatible with the standard\nSi fabrication processes, and as such, it is expected to be useful in the\ndesign of future integrated sensors.\n", "  The evolution of magnetic field in isolated neutron stars is one of the most\nimportant ingredients in the attempt to build a unified description of these\nobjects. A prediction of field evolution models is the existence of an\nequilibrium configuration, in which the Hall cascade vanishes. Recent\ncalculations have explored the field structure in this stage, called the Hall\nattractor. We use X-ray data of near-by, cooling neutron stars to probe this\nprediction, as these sources are surmised to be close to or at Hall attractor\nphase. We show that the source RX J1856.5-3754 might be closer to the attractor\nthan other sources of its class. Our modelling indicates that the properties of\nsurface thermal emission, assuming that the star is in the Hall attractor, are\nin contradiction with the spectral data of RX J1856.5-3754.\n", "  Flaring activity following gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), observed in both long and\nshort GRBs, signals a long-term activity of the central engine. However, its\nproduction mechanism has remained elusive. Here we develop a quantitative model\nof the idea proposed by Perna et al. of a disc whose outer regions fragment due\nto the onset of gravitational instability. The self-gravitating clumps migrate\nthrough the disc and begin to evolve viscously when tidal and shearing torques\nbreak them apart. Our model consists of two ingredients: theoretical bolometric\nflare lightcurves whose shape (width, skewness) is largely insensitive to the\nmodel parameters, and a spectral correction to match the bandpass of the\navailable observations, that is calibrated using the observed spectra of the\nflares. This simple model reproduces, with excellent agreement, the empirical\nstatistical properties of the flares as measured by their width-to-arrival time\nratio and skewness (ratio between decay and rise time). We present model fits\nto the observed lightcurves of two well-monitored flares, of GRB 060418 and of\nGRB 060904B. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative model\nable to reproduce the flare lightcurves and explain their global statistical\nproperties.\n", "  The presence and abundance of short lived radioisotopes (SLRs) $^{26}$Al and\n$^{60}$Fe in chondritic meteorites implies that the Sun formed in the vicinity\nof one or more massive stars that exploded as supernovae (SNe). Massive stars\nare more likely to form in massive star clusters ($>$1000 M$_{\\odot}$) than\nlower mass clusters. However, photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs from\nmassive stars and dynamical interactions with passing stars can inhibit planet\nformation in clusters with radii of $\\sim$1 pc. We investigate whether low-mass\n(50 - 200 M$_{\\odot}$) star clusters containing one or two massive stars are a\nmore likely avenue for early Solar system enrichment as they are more\ndynamically quiescent.\n  We analyse $N$-body simulations of the evolution of these low-mass clusters\nand find that a similar fraction of stars experience supernova enrichment than\nin high mass clusters, despite their lower densities. This is due to two-body\nrelaxation, which causes a significant expansion before the first supernova\neven in clusters with relatively low (100 stars pc$^{-3}$) initial densities.\nHowever, because of the high number of low mass clusters containing one or two\nmassive stars, the absolute number of enriched stars is the same, if not higher\nthan for more populous clusters. Our results show that direct enrichment of\nprotoplanetary discs from supernovae occurs as frequently in low mass clusters\ncontaining one or two massive stars (>20 M$_{\\odot}$) as in more populous star\nclusters (1000 M$_\\odot$). This relaxes the constraints on the direct\nenrichment scenario and therefore the birth environment of the Solar System.\n", "  Weak shocks in the intracluster medium may accelerate cosmic-ray protons and\ncosmic-ray electrons differently depending on the angle between the upstream\nmagnetic field and the shock normal. In this work, we investigate how shock\nobliquity affects the production of cosmic rays in high-resolution simulations\nof galaxy clusters. For this purpose, we performed a magneto-hydrodynamical\nsimulation of a galaxy cluster using the mesh refinement code \\enzo. We use\nLagrangian tracers to follow the properties of the thermal gas, the cosmic rays\nand the magnetic fields over time. We tested a number of different acceleration\nscenarios by varying the obliquity-dependent acceleration efficiencies of\nprotons and electrons, and by examining the resulting hadronic $\\gamma$-ray and\nradio emission. We find that the radio emission does not change significantly\nif only quasi-perpendicular shocks are able to accelerate cosmic-ray electrons.\nOur analysis suggests that radio emitting electrons found in relics have been\ntypically shocked many times before $z=0$. On the other hand, the hadronic\n$\\gamma$-ray emission from clusters is found to decrease significantly if only\nquasi-parallel shocks are allowed to accelerate cosmic-ray protons. This might\nreduce the tension with the low upper limits on $\\gamma$-ray emission from\nclusters set by the \\textit{Fermi}-satellite.\n", "  Cosmological measurements of both the expansion history and growth history\nhave matured, and the two together provide an important test of general\nrelativity. We consider their joint evolutionary track, showing that this has\nadvantages in distinguishing cosmologies relative to considering them\nindividually or at isolated redshifts. In particular, the joint comparison\nrelaxes the shape degeneracy that makes $f\\sigma_8(z)$ curves difficult to\nseparate from the overall growth amplitude. The conjoined method further helps\nvisualization of which combinations of redshift ranges provide the clearest\ndiscrimination. We examine standard dark energy cosmologies, modified gravity,\nand \"stuttering\" growth, each showing distinct signatures.\n", "  If dark matter interacts, even weakly, via non-gravitational forces,\nsimulations predict that it will be preferentially scattered towards the\ntrailing edge of the halo during collisions between galaxy clusters. This will\ntemporarily create a non-symmetric mass profile, with a trailing over-density\nalong the direction of motion. To test this hypothesis, we fit (and subtract)\nsymmetric halos to the weak gravitational data of 72 merging galaxy clusters\nobserved with the Hubble Space Telescope. We convert the shear directly into\nexcess {\\kappa} and project in to a one dimensional profile. We generate\nnumerical simulations and find that the one dimensional profile is well\ndescribed with simple Gaussian approximations. We detect the weak lensing\nsignal of trailing gas at a 4{\\sigma} confidence, finding a mean gas fraction\nof Mgas/Mdm = 0.13 +/- 0.035. We find no evidence for scattered dark matter\nparticles with a estimated scattering fraction of f = 0.03 +/- 0.05. Finally we\nfind that if we can reduce the statistical error on the positional estimate of\na single dark matter halo to <2.5\", then we will be able to detect a scattering\nfraction of 10% at the 3{\\sigma} level with current surveys. This poten- tially\ninteresting new method can provide an important independent test for other\ncomplimentary studies of the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter.\n", "  The requirement that planetary systems be dynamically stable is often used to\nvet new discoveries or set limits on unconstrained masses or orbital elements.\nThis is typically carried out via computationally expensive N-body simulations.\nWe show that characterizing the complicated and multi-dimensional stability\nboundary of tightly packed systems is amenable to machine learning methods. We\nfind that training an XGBoost machine learning algorithm on physically\nmotivated features yields an accurate classifier of stability in packed\nsystems. On the stability timescale investigated ($10^7$ orbits), it is 3\norders of magnitude faster than direct N-body simulations. Optimized machine\nlearning classifiers for dynamical stability may thus prove useful across the\ndiscipline, e.g., to characterize the exoplanet sample discovered by the\nupcoming Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). This proof of concept\nmotivates investing computational resources to train algorithms capable of\npredicting stability over longer timescales and over broader regions of phase\nspace.\n", "  The symbiotic nova V745 Sco was observed in outburst on 2014 February 6. Its\nobservations by the Chandra X-ray Observatory at days 16 and 17 have revealed a\nspectrum characterized by asymmetric and blue-shifted emission lines. Here we\ninvestigate the origin of these asymmetries through three-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulations describing the outburst during the first 20 days of\nevolution. The model takes into account thermal conduction and radiative\ncooling and assumes a blast wave propagates through an equatorial density\nenhancement. From the simulations, we synthesize the X-ray emission and derive\nthe spectra as they would be observed with Chandra. We find that both the blast\nwave and the ejecta distribution are efficiently collimated in polar directions\ndue to the presence of the equatorial density enhancement. The majority of the\nX-ray emission originates from the interaction of the blast with the equatorial\ndensity enhancement and is concentrated on the equatorial plane as a ring-like\nstructure. Our \"best-fit\" model requires a mass of ejecta in the outburst\n$M_{ej} \\approx 3\\times 10^{-7}\\,M_{\\odot}$ and an explosion energy $E_b\n\\approx 3 \\times 10^{43}$ erg and reproduces the distribution of emission\nmeasure vs temperature and the evolution of shock velocity and temperature\ninferred from the observations. The model predicts asymmetric and blue-shifted\nline profiles similar to those observed and explains their origin as due to\nsubstantial X-ray absorption of red-shifted emission by ejecta material. The\ncomparison of predicted and observed Ne and O spectral line ratios reveals no\nsigns of strong Ne enhancement and suggests the progenitor is a CO white dwarf.\n", "  We present a quantitative measurement of the amount of clustering present in\nthe inner $\\sim30$ kpc of the stellar halo of the Andromeda galaxy (M31). For\nthis we analyse the angular positions and radial velocities of the carefully\nselected Planetary Nebulae (PNe) in the M31 stellar halo. We study the\ncumulative distribution of pair-wise distances in angular position and line of\nsight velocity space, and find that the M31 stellar halo contains substantially\nmore stars in the form of close pairs as compared to that of a featureless\nsmooth halo. In comparison to a smoothed/scrambled distribution we estimate\nthat the clustering excess in the M31 inner halo is roughly $40\\%$ at maximum\nand on average $\\sim 20\\%$. Importantly, comparing against the 11 stellar halo\nmodels of \\cite{2005ApJ...635..931B}, which were simulated within the context\nof the $\\Lambda{\\rm CDM}$ cosmological paradigm, we find that the amount of\nsubstructures in the M31 stellar halo closely resembles that of a typical\n$\\Lambda{\\rm CDM}$ halo.\n", "  We compute the structure of a self-gravitating torus with polytropic\nequation-of-state (EOS) rotating in an imposed centrifugal potential. The\nPoisson-solver is based on isotropic multigrid with optimal covering factor\n(fluid section-to-grid area ratio). We work at $2$nd-order in the grid\nresolution for both finite difference and quadrature schemes. For soft EOS\n(i.e. polytropic index $n \\ge 1$), the underlying $2$nd-order is naturally\nrecovered for Boundary Values (BVs) and any other integrated quantity sensitive\nto the mass density (mass, angular momentum, volume, Virial Parameter, etc.),\ni.e. errors vary with the number $N$ of nodes per direction as $\\sim 1/N^2$.\nThis is, however, not observed for purely geometrical quantities (surface area,\nmeridional section area, volume), unless a subgrid approach is considered (i.e.\nboundary detection). Equilibrium sequences are also much better described,\nespecially close to critical rotation. Yet another technical effort is required\nfor hard EOS ($n < 1$), due to infinite mass density gradients at the fluid\nsurface. We fix the problem by using kernel splitting. Finally, we propose an\naccelerated version of the SCF-algorithm based on a node-by-node\npre-conditionning of the mass density at each step. The computing time is\nreduced by a factor $2$ typically, regardless of the polytropic index. There is\na priori no obstacle to applying these results and techniques to ellipsoidal\nconfigurations and even to $3$D-configurations.\n", "  The gravitational lens SDSS J1148+1930, also known as the Cosmic Horseshoe,\nis one of the biggest and of the most detailed Einstein rings ever observed. We\nuse the forward reconstruction method implemented in the lens fitting code\nLensed to investigate with great detail the properties of the lens and of the\nbackground source. We model the lens with different mass distributions,\nfocusing in particular on the determination of the slope of the dark matter\ncomponent. The inherent degeneracy between the lens slope and the source size\ncan be broken when we can isolate separate components of each lensed image, as\nin this case. For an elliptical power law model, $\\kappa(r) \\sim r^{-t}$, the\nresults favour a flatter-than-isothermal slope with a maximum-likelihood value\nt = 0.08. Instead, when we consider the contribution of the baryonic matter\nseparately, the maximum-likelihood value of the slope of the dark matter\ncomponent is t = 0.31 or t = 0.44, depending on the assumed Initial Mass\nFunction. We discuss the origin of this result by analysing in detail how the\nimages and the sources change when the slope t changes. We also demonstrate\nthat these slope values at the Einstein radius are not inconsistent with recent\nforecast from the theory of structure formation in the LambdaCDM model.\n", "  Self-gravitating accretion discs in a gravitoturbulent state, including\nradiation and gas pressures, are studied using a set of new analytical\nsolutions. While the Toomre parameter of the disc remains close to its critical\nvalue for the onset of gravitational instability, the dimensionless stress\nparameter is uniquely determined from the thermal energy reservoir of the disc\nand its cooling rate. Our solutions are applicable to the accretion discs with\ndynamically important radiation pressure like in the quasars discs. We show\nthat physical quantities of a gravitoturbulent disc in the presence of\nradiation are significantly modified compared to solutions with only gas\npressure. We show that the dimensionless stress parameter is an increasing\nfunction of the radial distance so that its steepness strongly depends on the\naccretion rate. In a disc without radiation its slope is 4.5, however, we show\nthat in the presence of radiation, it varies between 2 and 4.5 depending on the\naccretion rate and the central mass. As for the surface density, we find a\nshallower profile with an exponent -2 in a disc with sub-Eddington accretion\nrate compared to a similar disc, but without radiation, where its surface\ndensity slope is -3 independent of the accretion rate. We then investigate\ngravitational stability of the disc when the stress parameter reaches to its\ncritical value. In order to self-consistently determine the fragmentation\nboundary, however, it is shown that the critical value of the stress parameter\nis a power-law function of the ratio of gas pressure and the total pressure and\nits exponent is around 1.7. We also estimate the maximum mass of the central\nblack hole using our analytical solutions.\n", "  The precession of a test gyroscope along unbound equatorial plane geodesic\norbits around a Kerr black hole is analyzed with respect to a static reference\nframe whose axes point towards the \"fixed stars.\" The accumulated precession\nangle after a complete scattering process is evaluated and compared with the\ncorresponding change in the orbital angle. Limiting results for the\nnon-rotating Schwarzschild black hole case are also discussed.\n", "  Future solar missions and ground-based telescopes aim to understand the\nmagnetism of the solar chromosphere. We performed a supporting study in\nQuintero Noda et al. (2016) focused on the infrared Ca II 8542 A line and we\nconcluded that is one of the best candidates because it is sensitive to a large\nrange of atmospheric heights, from the photosphere to the middle chromosphere.\nHowever, we believe that it is worth to try improving the results produced by\nthis line observing additional spectral lines. In that regard, we examined the\nneighbour solar spectrum looking for spectral lines that could increase the\nsensitivity to the atmospheric parameters. Interestingly, we discovered several\nphotospheric lines that greatly improve the photospheric sensitivity to the\nmagnetic field vector. Moreover, they are located close to a second\nchromospheric line that also belongs to the Ca II infrared triplet, i.e. the Ca\nII 8498 A line, and enhances the sensitivity to the atmospheric parameters at\nchromospheric layers. We conclude that the lines in the vicinity of the Ca II\n8542 A line not only increase its sensitivity to the atmospheric parameters at\nall layers, but also they constitute an excellent spectral window for\nchromospheric polarimetry.\n", "  A powerful outburst of X-ray radiation from the supermassive black hole Sgr\nA* at the center of the Milky Way is believed to be responsible for the\nillumination of molecular clouds in the central ~100 pc of the Galaxy (Sunyaev\net al., 1993, Koyama et al., 1996). The reflected/reprocessed radiation comes\nto us with a delay corresponding to the light propagation time that depends on\nthe 3D position of molecular clouds with respect to Sgr A*. We suggest a novel\nway of determining the age of the outburst and positions of the clouds by\nstudying characteristic imprints left by the outburst in the spatial and time\nvariations of the reflected emission. We estimated the age of the outburst that\nilluminates the Sgr A molecular complex to be ~110 yr. This estimate implies\nthat we see the gas located ~10 pc further away from us than Sgr A*. If the Sgr\nB2 complex is also illuminated by the same outburst, then it is located ~130 pc\ncloser than our Galactic Center. The outburst was short (less than a few years)\nand the total amount of emitted energy in X-rays is $\\displaystyle \\sim\n10^{48}\\rho_3^{-1}$ erg, where $\\rho_3$ is the mean hydrogen density of the\ncloud complex in units of $10^3 {\\rm cm^{-3}}$. Energetically, such fluence can\nbe provided by a partial tidal disruption event or even by a capture of a\nplanet. Further progress in more accurate positioning and timing of the\noutburst should be possible with future X-ray polarimetric observations and\nlong-term systematic observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton. A few\nhundred-years long X-ray observations would provide a detailed 3D map of the\ngas density distribution in the central $\\sim 100$ pc region.\n", "  Multiple populations revealed in globular clusters (GCs) are important\nwindows to the formation and evolution of these stellar systems. The metal-rich\nGCs in the Galactic bulge are an indispensable part of this picture, but the\nhigh optical extinction in this region has prevented extensive research. In\nthis work, we use the high resolution near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic data\nfrom APOGEE to study the chemical abundances of NGC 6553, which is one of the\nmost metal-rich bulge GCs. We identify ten red giants as cluster members using\ntheir positions, radial velocities, iron abundances, and NIR photometry. Our\nsample stars show a mean radial velocity of $-0.14\\pm5.47$ km s$^{-1}$, and a\nmean [Fe/H] of $-0.15\\pm 0.05$. We clearly separate two populations of stars in\nC and N in this GC for the first time. NGC 6553 is the most metal-rich GC where\nthe multiple stellar population phenomenon is found until now. Substantial\nchemical variations are also found in Na, O, and Al. However, the two\npopulations show similar Si, Ca, and iron-peak element abundances. Therefore,\nwe infer that the CNO, NeNa, and MgAl cycles have been activated, but the MgAl\ncycle is too weak to show its effect on Mg. Type Ia and Type II supernovae do\nnot seem to have significantly polluted the second generation stars. Comparing\nwith other GC studies, NGC 6553 shows similar chemical variations as other\nrelatively metal-rich GCs. We also confront current GC formation theories with\nour results, and suggest possible avenues for improvement in the models.\n", "  Recent timing analysis reveals that the orbital period of the first\ndiscovered accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 is increasing at a\nrate $\\dot{P}_{\\rm orb}=(3.89\\pm0.15)\\times 10^{-12}~\\rm s\\,s^{-1}$, which is\nat least one order of magnitude higher than the value arising from the\nconservative mass transfer. An ejection of mass loss rate of $10^{-9}~\\rm\nM_{\\odot}{\\rm yr}^{-1}$ from the donor star at the inner Lagrangian point\nduring the quiescence state could interpret the observed orbital period\nderivative. However, it is unknown whether this source can offer such a high\nmass loss rate. In this work, we attempt to investigate an evolutionary channel\ntowards SAX J1808.4-3658. Once the accretion disk becomes thermally and\nviscously unstable, the spin-down luminosity of the millisecond pulsar and the\nX-ray luminosity during outbursts are assumed to evaporate the donor star, and\nthe resulting winds carry away the specific orbital angular momentum at the\ninner Lagrangian point. Our scenario could yield the observed orbital period,\nthe orbital period derivative, the peak X-ray luminosity during outbursts.\nLow-mass X-ray binaries with a $1.0~\\rm M_{\\odot}$ donor star, and an orbital\nperiod in the range of 0.8 - 1.5 d, may be the progenitor of SAX J1808.4-3658.\nOur numerical calculations propose that the current donor star mass is $0.044\n~\\rm M_{\\odot}$, which is in approximately agreement with the minimum mass of\nthe donor star. In addition, our scenario can also account for the formation of\nblack widows or the diamond planet like PSR J1719-1438.\n", "  The large epitaxial stress induced by the misfit between a triple atomic\nlayer Fe film and an Ir(111) substrate is relieved by the formation of a dense\ndislocation line network. Spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM)\ninvestigations show that the strain is locally varying within the Fe film and\nthat this variation affects the magnetic state of the system. Two types of\ndislocation line regions can be distinguished and both exhibit spin spirals\nwith strain-dependent periods (ranging from 3 nm to 10 nm). Using a simple\nmicromagnetic model, we attribute the changes of the period of the spin spirals\nto variations of the effective exchange coupling in the magnetic film. This\nassumption is supported by the observed dependence of the saturation magnetic\nfield on the spin spiral period. Moreover, magnetic skyrmions appear in an\nexternal magnetic field only in one type of dislocation line area, which we\nimpute to the different pinning properties of the dislocation lines.\n", "  The frequencies of the solar acoustic oscillations vary over the activity\ncycle. The variations in other activity proxies are found to be well correlated\nwith the variations in the acoustic frequencies. However, each proxy has a\nslightly different time behaviour. Our goal is to characterize the differences\nbetween the time behaviour of the frequency shifts and of two other activity\nproxies, namely, the area covered by sunspots and the 10.7cm flux. We define a\nnew observable that is particularly sensitive to the short-term frequency\nvariations. We then compare the observable when computed from model frequency\nshifts and from observed frequency shifts obtained with the Global Oscillation\nNetwork Group (GONG) for cycle 23. Our analysis shows that on the shortest\ntime-scales the variations in the frequency shifts seen in the GONG\nobservations are strongly correlated with the variations in the area covered by\nsunspots. However, a significant loss of correlation is still found. We verify\nthat the times when the frequency shifts and the sunspot area do not vary in a\nsimilar way tend to coincide with the times of the maxima of the quasi-biennial\nvariations seen in the solar seismic data. A similar analysis of the relation\nbetween the 10.7cm flux and the frequency shifts reveals that the short-time\nvariations in the frequency shifts follow even more closely those of the 10.7cm\nflux than those of the sunspot area. However, a loss of correlation between\nfrequency shifts and 10.7cm flux variations is still found around the same\ntimes.\n", "  We present the HI mass inventory for the RESOLVE survey, a volume-limited,\nmulti-wavelength census of >1500 z=0 galaxies spanning diverse environments and\ncomplete in baryonic mass down to dwarfs of 10^9 Msun. This first 21cm data\nrelease provides robust detections or strong upper limits (1.4M_HI < 5 to 10%\nof stellar mass M_stars) for 94% of RESOLVE. We examine global atomic\ngas-to-stellar mass ratios (G/S) in relation to galaxy environment using\nseveral metrics: group dark matter halo mass M_h , central/satellite\ndesignation, relative mass density of the cosmic web, and distance to nearest\nmassive group. We find that at fixed M_stars, satellites have decreasing G/S\nwith increasing M_h starting clearly at M_h = 10^12 Msun, suggesting the\npresence of starvation and/or stripping mechanisms associated with halo gas\nheating in intermediate-mass groups. The analogous relationship for centrals is\nuncertain because halo abundance matching builds in relationships between\ncentral G/S, stellar mass, and halo mass, which depend on the integrated group\nproperty used as a proxy for halo mass (stellar or baryonic mass). On larger\nscales G/S trends are less sensitive to the abundance matching method. At fixed\nM_h < 10^12 Msun, the fraction of gas-poor centrals increases with large-scale\nstructure density. In overdense regions, we identify a rare population of\ngas-poor centrals in low-mass (M_h < 10^11.4 Msun) halos primarily located\nwithin 1.5 times the virial radius of more massive (M_h > 10^12 Msun) halos,\nsuggesting that gas stripping and/or starvation may be induced by interactions\nwith larger halos or the surrounding cosmic web. We find that the detailed\nrelationship between G/S and environment varies when we examine different\nsubvolumes of RESOLVE independently, which we suggest may be a signature of\nassembly bias.\n", "  We carry out numerical simulations of circumbinary discs, solving the viscous\nhydrodynamics equations on a polar grid covering an extended disc outside the\nbinary co-orbital region. We use carefully controlled outer boundary conditions\nand long-term integrations to ensure that the disc reaches a quasi-steady\nstate, in which the time-averaged mass accretion rate onto the binary,\n$\\langle\\dot{M}\\rangle$, matches the mass supply rate at the outer disc. We\nfocus on binaries with comparable masses and a wide range of eccentricities\n($e_\\mathrm{B}$). For $e_\\mathrm{B} \\lesssim 0.05$, the mass accretion rate of\nthe binary is modulated at about $5$ times the binary period; otherwise it is\nmodulated at the binary period. The inner part of the circumbinary disc ($r\n\\lesssim 6 a_\\mathrm{B}$) generally becomes coherently eccentric. For low and\nhigh $e_\\mathrm{B}$, the disc line of apsides precesses around the binary, but\nfor intermediate $e_\\mathrm{B}$ ($0.2 - 0.4$), it instead becomes locked with\nthat of the binary. By considering the balance of angular momentum transport\nthrough the disc by advection, viscous stress, and gravitational torque, we\ndetermine the time-averaged net angular momentum transfer rate to the binary,\n$\\langle\\dot{J}\\rangle$. The specific angular momentum, $l_0 =\n\\langle\\dot{J}\\rangle/\\langle\\dot{M}\\rangle$, depends non-monotonically on\n$e_\\mathrm{B}$. Contrary to previous claims, we find that $l_0$ is positive for\nmost $e_\\mathrm{B}$, implying that the binary receives net angular momentum,\nwhich may cause its separation to grow with time. The minimum $l_0$ occurs at\nintermediate $e_\\mathrm{B}$ ($0.2 - 0.4$), corresponding to the regime where\nthe inner eccentric disc is apsidally aligned with the binary.\n", "  We test the hypothesis that the initial mass function (IMF) is determined by\nthe density probability distribution function (PDF) produced by supersonic\nturbulence. We compare 14 simulations of star cluster formation in 50 solar\nmass molecular cloud cores where the initial turbulence contains either purely\nsolenoidal or purely compressive modes, in each case resolving fragmentation to\nthe opacity limit to determine the resultant IMF. We find statistically\nindistinguishable IMFs between the two sets of calculations, despite a factor\nof two difference in the star formation rate and in the standard deviation of\n$\\log(\\rho)$. This suggests that the density PDF, while determining the star\nformation rate, is not the primary driver of the IMF.\n", "  We analyse the evolution of environmental quenching efficiency, the fraction\nof quenched cluster galaxies that would be star-forming if they were in the\nfield, as a function of redshift in 14 spectroscopically confirmed galaxy\nclusters with 0.87 < z < 1.63 from the Spitzer Adaptation of the Red-Sequence\nCluster Survey (SpARCS). The clusters are the richest in the survey at each\nredshift. Passive fractions rise from $42_{-13}^{+10}$\\% at z ~ 1.6 to\n$80_{-9}^{+12}$\\% at z ~ 1.3 and $88_{-3}^{+4}$\\% at z < 1.1, outpacing the\nchange in passive fraction in the field. Environmental quenching efficiency\nrises dramatically from $16_{-19}^{+15}$ at z ~ 1.6 to $62_{-15}^{+21}\\% at z ~\n1.3 and $73_{-7}^{+8}$\\% at z $\\lesssim$ 1.1. This work is the first to show\ndirect observational evidence for a rapid increase in the strength of\nenvironmental quenching in galaxy clusters at z ~ 1.5, where simulations show\ncluster-mass halos undergo non-linear collapse and virialisation.\n", "  We present detailed science cases that a large fraction of the Indian AGN\ncommunity is interested in pursuing with the upcoming Square Kilometre Array\n(SKA). These interests range from understanding low luminosity active galactic\nnuclei in the nearby Universe to powerful radio galaxies at high redshifts.\nImportant unresolved science questions in AGN physics are discussed. Ongoing\nlow-frequency surveys with the SKA pathfinder telescope GMRT, are highlighted.\n", "  Compact radio cores associated with relativistic jets are often observed in\nboth active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries. Their radiative properties\nfollow some general scaling laws which primarily depend on their masses and\naccretion rates. However, it has been suggested that the black hole spin can\nalso strongly influence the power and radio flux of these. Here, we attempt to\nestimate the dependency of the radio luminosity of steady jets launched by\naccretion disks on black hole mass, accretion rate and spin using numerical\nsimulations. We make use of 3D GRMHD simulations of accretion disks around\nlow-luminosity black holes in which the jet radio emission is produced by the\njet sheath. We find that the radio flux increases roughly by a factor of 6 as\nthe back hole spin increases from a~0 to a=0.98. This is comparable to the\nincrease in accretion power with spin, meaning that the ratio between radio jet\nand accretion power is hardly changing. Although our jet spine power scales as\nexpected for the Blandford-Znajek process, the dependency of jet radio\nluminosity on the black hole spin is somewhat weaker. Also weakly rotating\nblack holes can produce visible radio jets. The overall scaling of the radio\nemission with black hole mass and accretion rate is consistent with the\nscale-invariant analytical models used to explain the fundamental plane of\nblack hole activity. Spin does not introduce a significant scatter in this\nmodel. The jet-sheath model can describe well resolved accreting systems, such\nas SgrA* and M87, as well as the general scaling behavior of low-luminosity\nblack holes. Hence the model should be applicable to a wide range of radio jets\nin sub-Eddington black holes. The black hole spin has an effect on the\nproduction of visible radio jet, but it may not be the main driver to produce\nvisible radio jets. An extension of our findings to powerful quasars remains\nspeculative.\n", "  The survival of dust grains in galaxies depends on various processes. Dust\ncan be produced in stars, it can grow in the interstellar medium and be\ndestroyed by astration and interstellar shocks. In this paper, we assemble a\nfew data samples of local and distant star-forming galaxies to analyse various\ndust-related quantities in low and high redshift galaxies, to study how the\nrelations linking the dust mass to the stellar mass and star formation rate\nevolve with redshift. We interpret the available data by means of chemical\nevolution models for discs and proto-spheroid (PSPH) starburst galaxies. In\nparticular, we focus on the dust-to-stellar mass (DTS) ratio, as this quantity\nrepresents a true measure of how much dust per unit stellar mass survives the\nvarious destruction processes in galaxies and is observable. The theoretical\nmodels outline the strong dependence of this quantity on the underlying star\nformation history. Spiral galaxies are characterised by a nearly constant DTS\nas a function of the stellar mass and cosmic time, whereas PSPHs present an\nearly steep increase of the DTS, which stops at a maximal value and decreases\nin the latest stages. In their late starburst phase, these models show a\ndecrease of the DTS with their mass, which allows us to explain the observed\nanti-correlation between the DTS and the stellar mass. The observed redshift\nevolution of the DTS ratio shows an increase from z~0 to z~1, followed by a\nroughly constant behaviour at 1<z<2.5. Our models indicate a steep decrease of\nthe global DTS at early times, which implies an expected decrease of the DTS at\nlarger redshift.\n", "  We present a photometric and light curve analysis of an eccentric eclipsing\nbinary in the K2 Campaign 0 field that resides in Sh 2-252E, a young star\ncluster embedded in an H II region. We describe a spectroscopic investigation\nof the three brightest stars in the crowded aperture to identify which is the\nbinary system. We find that none of these stars are components of the eclipsing\nbinary system, which must be one of the fainter nearby stars. These bright\ncluster members all have remarkable spectra: Sh 2-252a (EPIC 202062176) is a\nB0.5 V star with razor sharp absorption lines, Sh 2-252b is a Herbig A0 star\nwith disk-like emission lines, and Sh 2-252c is a pre-main sequence star with\nvery red color.\n", "  The decuplet baryons, $\\Delta$, $\\Sigma^{*}$, $\\Xi^{*}$ and $\\Omega^{-}$, are\nstudied in nuclear matter by using the in-medium QCD sum rules. By fixing the\nthree momentum of the particles under consideration at the rest frame of the\nmedium, the negative energy contributions are removed. It is obtained that the\nparameters of the $\\Delta$ baryon are more affected by the medium against the\n$\\Omega^{-}$ state, containing three strange quarks, whose mass and residue do\nnot affected by the medium, considerably. We also find the vector and scalar\nself energies of these baryons in nuclear matter. By the recent progresses at\n$\\bar{P}$ANDA experiment at FAIR and NICA facility it may be possible to study\nthe in-medium properties of such states even the multi-strange $\\Xi^{*}$ and\n$\\Omega^{-}$ systems in near future.\n", "  We discuss images of the star clusters GLIMPSE C01 (GC01) and GLIMPSE C02\n(GC02) that were recorded with the Subaru IRCS. Distortions in the wavefront\nwere corrected with the RAVEN adaptive optics (AO) science demonstrator,\nallowing individual stars in the central regions of both clusters -- where the\nfractional contamination from non-cluster objects is lowest -- to be imaged. In\naddition to J, H, and K' images, both clusters were observed through a\nnarrow-band filter centered near 3.05um; GC01 was also observed through two\nother narrow-band filters that sample longer wavelengths. Stars in the\nnarrow-band images have a FWHM that is close to the telescope diffraction\nlimit, demonstrating that open loop AO systems like RAVEN can deliver\nexceptional image quality. The near-infrared color magnitude diagram of GC01 is\nsmeared by non-uniform extinction with a dispersion +/- 0.13 magnitudes in A_K.\nThe Red Clump is identified in the K luminosity function (LF) of GC01, and a\ndistance modulus of 13.6 is found. The K LF of GC01 is consistent with a system\nthat is dominated by stars with an age > 1 Gyr. As for GC02, the K LF is flat\nfor K > 16, and the absence of a sub-giant branch argues against an old age if\nthe cluster is at a distance of ~ 7 kpc. Archival SPITZER [3.6] and [4.5]\nimages of the clusters are also examined, and the red giant branch-tip is\nidentified.\n", "  Content: For up to a few millions of years, pebbles must provide a\nquasi-steady inflow of solids from the outer parts of protoplanetary disks to\ntheir inner regions. Aims: We wish to understand how a significant fraction of\nthe pebbles grows into planetesimals instead of being lost to the host star.\nMethods:We examined analytically how the inward flow of pebbles is affected by\nthe snow line and under which conditions dust-rich (rocky) planetesimals form.\nWhen calculating the inward drift of solids that is due to gas drag, we\nincluded the back-reaction of the gas to the motion of the solids. Results: We\nshow that in low-viscosity protoplanetary disks (with a monotonous surface\ndensity similar to that of the minimum-mass solar nebula), the flow of pebbles\ndoes not usually reach the required surface density to form planetesimals by\nstreaming instability. We show, however, that if the pebble-to-gas-mass flux\nexceeds a critical value, no steady solution can be found for the solid-to-gas\nratio. This is particularly important for low-viscosity disks (alpha < 10^(-3))\nwhere we show that inside of the snow line, silicate-dust grains ejected from\nsublimating pebbles can accumulate, eventually leading to the formation of\ndust-rich planetesimals directly by gravitational instability. Conclusions:\nThis formation of dust-rich planetesimals may occur for extended periods of\ntime, while the snow line sweeps from several au to inside of 1 au. The\nrock-to-ice ratio may thus be globally significantly higher in planetesimals\nand planets than in the central star.\n", "  We discuss the generalization of the NUT spacetime in General Relativity (GR)\nwithin the framework of the (dynamical) Einstein--Chern-Simons (ECS) theory\nwith a massless scalar field. These configurations approach asymptotically the\nNUT spacetime and are characterized by the `electric' and `magnetic' mass\nparameters and a scalar `charge'. The solutions are found both analytically and\nnumerically. The analytical approach is perturbative around the Einstein\ngravity background. Our results indicate that the ECS configurations share all\nbasic properties of the NUT spacetime in GR. However, when considering the\nsolutions inside the event horizon, we find that in contrast to the GR case,\nthe spacetime curvature grows (apparently) without bound.\n", "  Since the early 1970s, inversion techniques have become the most useful tool\nfor inferring the magnetic, dynamic, and thermodynamic properties of the solar\natmosphere. The intrinsic model dependence makes it necessary to formulate\nspecific means that include the physics in a properly quantitative way. The\ncore of this physics lies in the radiative transfer equation (RTE), where the\nproperties of the atmosphere are assumed to be known while the unknowns are the\nfour Stokes profiles. The solution of the (differential) RTE is known as the\ndirect or forward problem. From an observational point of view, the problem is\nrather the opposite: the data are made up of the observed Stokes profiles and\nthe unknowns are the solar physical quantities. Inverting the RTE is therefore\nmandatory. Indeed, the formal solution of this equation can be considered an\nintegral equation. The solution of such an integral equation is called the\ninverse problem. Inversion techniques are automated codes aimed at solving the\ninverse problem.\n  The foundations of inversion techniques are critically revisited with an\nemphasis on making explicit the many assumptions underlying each of them. An\nincremental complexity procedure is advised for the implementation in practice.\nCoarse details of the profiles or coarsely sam- pled profiles should be\nreproduced first with simple model atmospheres (with, for example, a few\nphysical quantities that are constant with optical depth). If the Stokes\nprofiles are well sampled and differences between synthetic and observed ones\nare greater than the noise, then the inversion should proceed by using more\ncomplex models (that is, models where physical quantities vary with depth or,\neventually, with more than one component). Significant im- provements are\nexpected as well from the use of new inversion techniques that take the spatial\ndegradation by the instruments into account.\n", "  Aims: We want to study the physical properties of the ionized jet emission in\nthe vicinity of an O-type young stellar object (YSO), and estimate how\nefficient is the transfer of energy and momentum from small- to large-scale\noutflows. Methods: We conducted Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA)\nobservations, at both 22 and 45 GHz, of the compact and faint radio continuum\nemission in the high-mass star-forming region G023.01-00.41, with an angular\nresolution between 0.3\" and 0.1\", and a thermal rms of the order of 10\nuJy/beam. Results: We discovered a collimated thermal (bremsstrahlung) jet\nemission, with a radio luminosity (L_rad) of 24 mJy kpc^2 at 45 GHz, in the\ninner 1000 AU from an O-type YSO. The radio thermal jet has an opening angle of\n44 degrees and brings a momentum rate of 8 10^-3 M_sun yr^-1 km/s. By combining\nthe new data with previous observations of the molecular outflow and water\nmaser shocks, we can trace the outflow emission from its driving source through\nthe molecular clump, across more than two order of magnitude in length (500\nAU-0.2 pc). We find that the momentum-transfer efficiency, between the inner\njet emission and the extended outflow of entrained ambient gas, is near unity.\nThis result suggests that the large-scale flow is swept-up by the mechanical\nforce of the radio jet emission, which originates in the inner 1000 AU from the\nhigh-mass YSO.\n", "  Until recently, only a handful of dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) were\nknown at $z>4$, most of them significantly amplified by gravitational lensing.\nHere, we have increased the number of such DSFGs substantially, selecting\ngalaxies from the uniquely wide 250-, 350- and 500-$\\mu$m Herschel-ATLAS\nimaging survey on the basis of their extremely red far-infrared colors and\nfaint 350- and 500-$\\mu$m flux densities - ergo they are expected to be largely\nunlensed, luminous, rare and very distant. The addition of ground-based\ncontinuum photometry at longer wavelengths from the JCMT and APEX allows us to\nidentify the dust peak in their SEDs, better constraining their redshifts. We\nselect the SED templates best able to determine photometric redshifts using a\nsample of 69 high-redshift, lensed DSFGs, then perform checks to assess the\nimpact of the CMB on our technique, and to quantify the systematic uncertainty\nassociated with our photometric redshifts, $\\sigma=0.14\\,(1+z)$, using a sample\nof 25 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, each consistent with our color\nselection. For Herschel-selected ultrared galaxies with typical colors of\n$S_{500}/S_{250}\\sim 2.2$ and $S_{500}/S_{350}\\sim 1.3$ and flux densities,\n$S_{500}\\sim 50\\,$mJy, we determine a median redshift, $\\hat{z}_{\\rm\nphot}=3.66$, an interquartile redshift range, 3.30$-$4.27, with a median\nrest-frame 8$-$1000-$\\mu$m luminosity, $\\hat{L}_{\\rm IR}$, of $1.3\\times\n10^{13}\\,$L$_\\odot$. A third lie at $z>4$, suggesting a space density,\n$\\rho_{z>4}$, of $\\approx 6 \\times 10^{-7}\\,$Mpc$^{-3}$. Our sample contains\nthe most luminous known star-forming galaxies, and the most over-dense cluster\nof starbursting proto-ellipticals yet found.\n", "  The Carina star-forming region is one of the largest in the Galaxy, and its\nmassive star population is still being unveiled. The large number of stars\ncombined with high, and highly variable, interstellar extinction makes it\ninherently difficult to find OB stars in this type of young region. We present\nthe results of a spectroscopic campaign to study the massive star population of\nthe Carina Nebula, with the primary goal to confirm or reject previously\nidentified Carina OB star candidates. A total of 141 known O- and B-type stars\nand 94 candidates were observed, of which 73 candidates had a high enough\nsignal-to-noise ratio to classify. We find 23 new OB stars within the Carina\nNebula, a 32% confirmation rate. One of the new OB stars has blended spectra\nand is suspected to be a double-lined spectroscopic binary (SB2). We also\nreclassify the spectral types of the known OB stars and discover nine new SB2s\namong this population. Finally, we discuss the spatial distribution of these\nnew OB stars relative to known structures in the Carina NSebula.\n", "  As it happened in all domains of human activities, economic issues and the\nincrease of people working in scientific research have altered the way\nscientific production is evaluated so as the objectives of performing the\nevaluation. Introduced in 2005 by J. E. Hirsch as an indicator able to measure\nindividual scientific output not only in terms of quantity, but also in terms\nof quality, h index has spread throughout the world. In 2007, Hirsch proposed\nits adoption also as the best to predict future scientific achievement and,\nconsequently, a useful guide for investments in research and for institutions\nwhen hiring members for their scientific staff. Since then, several authors\nhave also been using the Thomson ISI Web of Science database to develop their\nproposals for evaluating research output. Here, using a software we have\ndeveloped, we analyse more than 100 thousand articles and show that a subtle\nflaw in Web of Science can inflate the results of info collected, therefore\ncompromising the exactness and, consequently, the effectiveness of Hirsch's\nproposal and its variations.\n", "  We summarize basic observational properties of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs),\nincluding prompt emission properties, afterglow properties, and classification\nschemes. We also briefly comment on the current physical understanding of these\nproperties.\n", "  We calculate the pion transition form factor ${\\cal\nF}_{\\pi^0\\gamma^*\\gamma^*}(q_1^2,q_2^2)$, which describe the interaction of an\non-shell pion with two off-shell photons, using lattice QCD simulations with\ntwo degenerate flavors of dynamical quarks. This form factor is the main\ningredient in the calculation of the pion-pole contribution to hadronic\nlight-by-light scattering in the muon $g-2$, $a_\\mu^{\\mathrm{HLbL}; \\pi^0}$. We\nfocus our study on the spacelike region with photon virtualities up to\n$1.5~\\mathrm{GeV}^2$, not yet measured experimentally. Several lattice spacings\nand pion masses are used to extrapolate the results to the physical point and a\ncomparison with different phenomenological models is performed. Finally, we use\nour extrapolated form factor to provide a lattice determinaiton of\n$a_\\mu^{\\mathrm{HLbL}; \\pi^0}$.\n", "  We propose a simple and generic holographic $c$-function that is defined\npurely from geometry by using the non-affine expansion for null congruences. We\nexamined the proposal for BPS black solutions in $\\mathcal{N}=2$ gauged\nsupergravity that interpolate between two different dimensional AdS spacetimes\nand also for domain wall solutions. Moreover, we commented on the relation of\nthis geometric proposal with the one from the holographic entanglement entropy.\n", "  Magnetic fluctuations through the molecular cloud cores can produce ambipolar\ndiffusion (AD) heating, which consequently can produce temperature gradients\nthrough the core. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effects of these\nproduced temperature gradients on the radius and mass of the non-isothermal\nmodified Bonnor-Ebert spheres (MBES). Here, we use the parameter $\\kappa$ to\nrepresent the magnetic fluctuations through the molecular cloud cores. This\nparameter introduces the change of magnetic filed strength in the length-scale.\nThe results show that increasing of $\\kappa$ leads to an increase of the radius\nand mass of MBES. The most important result is existence of the gravitationally\nstable high-mass prestellar cores at the low-density molecular medium with\ngreat magnetic fluctuations.\n", "  We review our current understanding of the progenitors of both long and short\nduration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Constraints can be derived from multiple\ndirections, and we use three distinct strands; i) direct observations of GRBs\nand their host galaxies, ii) parameters derived from modeling, both via\npopulation synthesis and direct numerical simulation and iii) our understanding\nof plausible analog progenitor systems observed in the local Universe. From\nthese joint constraints, we describe the likely routes that can drive massive\nstars to the creation of long GRBs, and our best estimates of the scenarios\nthat can create compact object binaries which will ultimately form short GRBs,\nas well as the associated rates of both long and short GRBs. We further discuss\nhow different the progenitors may be in the case of black hole engine or\nmillisecond-magnetar models for the production of GRBs, and how central engines\nmay provide a unifying theme between many classes of extremely luminous\ntransient, from luminous and super-luminous supernovae to long and short GRBs.\n", "  We investigate triggering, activation, and ejection of a solar eruptive\nprominence that occurred in a multi-polar flux system of active region NOAA\n11548 on 2012 August 18 by analyzing data from AIA on board SDO, RHESSI, and\nEUVI/SECCHI on board STEREO. Prior to the prominence activation, we observed\nstriking coronal activities in the form of a blowout jet which is associated\nwith rapid eruption of a cool flux rope. Further, the jet-associated flux rope\neruption underwent splitting and rotation during its outward expansion. These\ncoronal activities are followed by the prominence activation during which it\nslowly rises with a speed of ~12 km/s while the region below the prominence\nemits gradually varying EUV and thermal X-ray emissions. From these\nobservations, we propose that the prominence eruption is a complex, multi-step\nphenomenon in which a combination of internal (tether-cutting reconnection) and\nexternal (i.e., pre-eruption coronal activities) processes are involved. The\nprominence underwent catastrophic loss of equilibrium with the onset of the\nimpulsive phase of an M1.8 flare suggesting large-scale energy release by\ncoronal magnetic reconnection. We obtained signatures of particle acceleration\nin the form of power law spectra with hard electron spectral index (delta ~ 3)\nand strong HXR footpoint sources. During the impulsive phase, a hot EUV\nplasmoid was observed below the apex of the erupting prominence that ejected in\nthe direction of the prominence with a speed of ~177 km/s. The temporal,\nspatial and kinematic correlations between the erupting prominence and the\nplasmoid imply that the magnetic reconnection supported the fast ejection of\nprominence in the lower corona.\n", "  Different proposals for regular rotating black hole spacetimes have appeared\nrecently in the literature. However, a rigorous analysis and proof of the\nregularity of this kind of spacetimes is still lacking. In this note we analyze\nrotating Kerr-like black hole spacetimes and find the necessary and sufficient\nconditions for the regularity of all their second order scalar invariants\npolynomial in the Riemann tensor. We also show that the regularity is linked to\na violation of the weak energy conditions around the core of the rotating black\nhole.\n", "  Several pieces of evidence suggest that silicate grains in primitive\nmeteorites are not interstellar grains but condensates formed in the early\nsolar system. Moreover, the size distribution of matrix grains in chondrites\nimplies that these condensates might be formed as nanometer-sized grains.\nTherefore, we propose a novel scenario for rocky planetesimal formation in\nwhich nanometer-sized silicate grains are produced by evaporation and\nrecondensation events in early solar nebula, and rocky planetesimals are formed\nvia aggregation of these nanograins. We reveal that silicate nanograins can\ngrow into rocky planetesimals via direct aggregation without catastrophic\nfragmentation and serious radial drift, and our results provide a suitable\ncondition for protoplanet formation in our solar system.\n", "  We report on the co-existence of longitudinal and transverse oscillations in\nan active filament. On March 15$^{th}$ 2013, a M1.1 class flare was observed in\nthe active region AR 11692. A CME was found to be associated with the flare.\n{The CME generated a shock wave that triggered the oscillations in a nearby\nfilament}, situated at the south-west of the active region as observed from\nNational Solar Observatory (NSO)\\textit{Global Oscillation Network Group}(GONG)\nH$\\alpha$ images. In this work we report the longitudinal oscillations in the\ntwo ends of the filament, co-existing with the transverse oscillations. We\npropose a scenario in which {an} incoming shock wave hits the filament\nobliquely and triggers both longitudinal and transverse oscillations. Using the\nobserved parameters, we estimate the lower limit of the magnetic field\nstrength. We use simple pendulum model with gravity as the restoring force to\nestimate the radius of curvature. We also calculate the mass accretion rate\nwhich causes the filament motions to damp quite fast.\n", "  We detect and analyse transverse oscillations in a coronal loop, lying at the\nsouth east limb of the Sun as seen from the \\textit{{Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly}} (AIA) onboard \\textit{{Solar Dynamics Observatory}} (SDO). The jet\nis believed to trigger transverse oscillations in the coronal loop. The jet\noriginates from a region close to the coronal loop on 19$^{\\rm th}$ September\n2014 at 02:01:35 UT. The length of the loop is estimated to be between\n377-539~Mm. Only one complete oscillation is detected with an average period of\nabout $32\\pm5$~min. Using MHD seismologic inversion techniques, we estimate the\nmagnetic field inside the coronal loop to be between $2.68 -4.5$~G. The\nvelocity of the hot and cool components of the jet is estimated to be\n168~km~s$^{-1}$ and 43~km~s$^{-1}$, respectively. The energy density of the jet\nis found to be greater than the energy density of the oscillating coronal loop.\nTherefore, we conclude that the jet {triggered} transverse oscillations in the\ncoronal loop. To our knowledge, this is the first coronal loop seismology study\nusing the properties of a jet propagation {to trigger} oscillations.\n", "  This is a Reply to comments published in Physics of Life Reviews, on our\narticle \"Evolutionary game theory using agent-based methods\" (Physics of Life\nReviews, 2016, arXiv:1404.0994).\n", "  The Eisenhart lift provides an elegant geometric description of a dynamical\nsystem of second order in terms of null geodesics of the Brinkmann-type metric.\nIn this work, we attempt to generalize the Eisenhart method so as to encompass\nhigher derivative models. The analysis relies upon Ostrogradsky's Hamiltonian.\nA consistent geometric description seems feasible only for a particular class\nof potentials. The scheme is exemplified by the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator.\n", "  Stars similar to the Sun, known as solar analogues, provide an excellent\nopportunity to study the preceding and following evolutionary phases of our\nhost star. The unprecedented quality of photometric data collected by the\n\\Kepler NASA mission allows us to characterise solar-like stars through\nasteroseismology and study diagnostics of stellar evolution, such as variation\nof magnetic activity, rotation and the surface lithium abundance. In this\nproject, presented in a series of papers by Salabert et al. (2016a,b) and Beck\net al (2016a,b), we investigate the link between stellar activity, rotation,\nlithium abundance and oscillations in a group of 18 solar-analogue stars\nthrough space photometry, obtained with the NASA Kepler space telescope and\nfrom currently 50+ hours of ground-based, high-resolution spectroscopy with the\nHermes instrument. In these proceedings, we first discuss the selection of the\nstars in the sample, observations and calibrations and then summarise the main\nresults of the project. By investigating the chromospheric and photospheric\nactivity of the solar analogues in this sample, it was shown that for a large\nfraction of these stars the measured activity levels are compatible to levels\nof the 11-year solar activity cycle 23. A clear correlation between the lithium\nabundance and surface rotation was found for rotation periods shorter than the\nsolar value. Comparing the lithium abundance measured in the solar analogues to\nevolutionary models with the Toulouse-Geneva Evolutionary Code (TGEC), we found\nthat the solar models calibrated to the Sun also correctly describe the set of\nsolar/stellar analogs showing that they share the same internal mixing physics.\nFinally, the star KIC 3241581 and KIC 10644353 are discussed in more detail.\n", "  A short period eclipsing binary star CV Boo is tested for the possible\nexistence of additional bodies in the system with a help of the light equation\nmethod. We use data on the moments of minima from the literature as well as\nfrom our observations during 2014 May--July. A variation of the CV Boo's\norbital period is found with a period of $\\approx 75$ d. This variation can be\nexplained by the influence of a third star with a mass of $\\approx\n0.4M_{\\odot}$ in an eccentric orbit with $e\\approx 0.9$. A possibility that the\norbital period changes on long time scales is discussed. The suggested tertiary\ncompanion is near the chaotic zone around the central binary, so CV Boo\nrepresents an interesting example to test its dynamical evolution. A list of 14\nminima moments of the binary obtained from our observations is presented.\n", "  We have performed transverse-field muon spin relaxation (TF-$\\mu$SR)\nmeasurements on ambient-pressure-grown polycrystalline\n$\\mathrm{LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}}$. From these measurements, no signature of\nmagnetic order is found down to 25 mK. The value of the magnetic penetration\ndepth extrapolated to 0 K is 0.89 (5) $\\mu$m. The temperature dependence of\nsuperconducting penetration depth is best described by either a multigap s +\ns-wave model with $\\Delta_{1}$ = 0.947 (7) meV and $\\Delta_{2}$ = 0.22 (4) meV\nor the ansiotropic s-wave model with $\\Delta(0)$ = 0.776 meV and anisotropic\ngap amplitude ratio $\\Delta_{min}/\\Delta_{max}$ = 0.34. Comparisons with other\npotentially multigap $\\mathrm{BiS_{2}}$-based superconductors are discussed. We\nfind that these $\\mathrm{BiS_{2}}$-based superconductors, including\n$\\mathrm{Bi_{4}O_{4}S_3}$ and the high-pressure synthesized\n$\\mathrm{LaO_{0.5}F_{0.5}BiS_{2}}$, generally conform to the Uemura relation.\n", "  We consider a spherically symmetric stellar configuration with a density\nprofile $\\rho(r)=\\frac{c^2}{8\\pi G r^2} $. This configuration satisfies the\nSchwarzchild black hole condition $\\frac {2GM}{c^2 R}=~1$ for every $ r =R $.\nWe refer it as \"Planckonion\". The interesting thing about the Plankonion is\nthat it has an onion like structure. The central sphere with radius of the\nPlank-lenght $ L_p=\\sqrt{(\\frac {2\\hbar G}{c^3})}$ has one unit of the\nPlanck-mass $M_p=\\sqrt {(\\frac {c\\hbar}{2G})}$. Subsequent spherical shells of\nradial width $L_p$ contain exactly one unit of $M_p$. We study this stellar\nconfiguration using Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and show that the\nequation is satisfied if pressure $P(r)=-\\rho(r)$. On the geometrical side, the\nspace component of the metric blows up at every point. The time component of\nthe metric is zero inside the star but only in the sense of a distribution\n(generalized function). The Planckonions mimic some features of black holes but\navoid appearance of central singularity because of the violation of null energy\nconditions.\n", "  Periodic driving has emerged as a powerful experimental tool to engineer\nphysical properties of isolated, synthetic quantum systems. However, due to the\nlack of energy conservation and heating effects, non-trivial (e.g.,\ntopological) many-body states in periodically driven (Floquet) systems are\ngenerally metastable. Therefore it is necessary to find strategies for\npreparing long-lived many-body states in Floquet systems. We develop a\ntheoretical framework for describing the dynamical preparation of states in\nFloquet systems by a slow turn-on of the drive. We find that the dynamics of\nthe system is well approximated by the initial state evolving under a slowly\nvarying effective Hamiltonian $H_{\\rm eff}^{(s)}(t)$, provided the ramp speed\n$s \\gg t_*^{-1} \\sim e^{-{\\mathcal{C} \\frac{\\omega}{J}}}$, the inverse of the\ncharacteristic heating time-scale in the Floquet system. At such ramp speeds,\nthe heating effects due to the drive are exponentially suppressed. We compute\nthe slowly varying effective Hamiltonian $H_{\\rm eff}^{(s)}(t)$, and show that\nat the end of the ramp it is identical to the effective Hamiltonian of the\nunramped Floquet system, up to small corrections of the order $O(s)$.\nTherefore, the system effectively undergoes a slow quench from $H_0$ to $H_{\\rm\neff}$. As an application, we consider the passage of the slow quench through a\nquantum critical point (QCP), and estimate the energy absorbed due to the\nnon-adiabatic passage through the QCP via a Kibble-Zurek mechanism. By\nminimizing the energy absorbed due to both the drive and the ramp, we find an\noptimal ramp speed $s_* \\sim t_*^{-z/({d+2z})}$ for which both heating effects\nare exponentially suppressed. Our results bridge the gap between the numerous\nproposals to obtain interesting systems via Floquet engineering, and the actual\npreparation of such systems in their effective ground states.\n", "  We introduce a novel class of localized atomic environment representations,\nbased upon the Coulomb matrix. By combining these functions with the Gaussian\napproximation potential approach, we present LC-GAP, a new system for\ngenerating atomic potentials through machine learning (ML). Tests on the QM7,\nQM7b and GDB9 biomolecular datasets demonstrate that potentials created with\nLC-GAP can successfully predict atomization energies for molecules larger than\nthose used for training to chemical accuracy, and can (in the case of QM7b)\nalso be used to predict a range of other atomic properties with accuracy in\nline with the recent literature. As the best-performing representation has only\nlinear dimensionality in the number of atoms in a local atomic environment,\nthis represents an improvement both in prediction accuracy and computational\ncost when considered against similar Coulomb matrix-based methods.\n", "  Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) resonators serve as frequency selective\ncomponents in applications ranging from biology to communications. In this\npaper, the dynamic behavior of an RF MEMS disk resonator is formulated using an\nanalytical method.\n", "  Clay minerals are ubiquitous in nature, and the manner in which they interact\nwith their surroundings has important industrial and environmental\nimplications. Consequently, a molecular-level understanding of the adsorption\nof molecules on clay surfaces is crucial. In this regard computer simulations\nplay an important role, yet the accuracy of widely used empirical force fields\n(FF) and density functional theory (DFT) exchange-correlation functionals is\noften unclear in adsorption systems dominated by weak interactions. Herein we\npresent results from quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) for water and methanol\nadsorption on the prototypical clay kaolinite. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first time QMC has been used to investigate adsorption at a\ncomplex, natural surface such as a clay. As well as being valuable in their own\nright, the QMC benchmarks obtained provide reference data against which the\nperformance of cheaper DFT methods can be tested. Indeed using various DFT\nexchange-correlation functionals yields a very broad range of adsorption\nenergies, and it is unclear a priori which evaluation is better. QMC reveals\nthat in the systems considered here it is essential to account for van der\nWaals (vdW) dispersion forces since this alters both the absolute and relative\nadsorption energies of water and methanol. We show, via FF simulations, that\nincorrect relative energies can lead to significant changes in the interfacial\ndensities of water and methanol solutions at the kaolinite interface. Despite\nthe clear improvements offered by the vdW-corrected and the vdW-inclusive\nfunctionals, absolute adsorption energies are often overestimated, suggesting\nthat the treatment of vdW forces in DFT is not yet a solved problem.\n", "  We present the first resolved image of the debris disk around the 16+/-8 Myr\nold star, HD 114082. The observation was made in the H-band using the SPHERE\ninstrument. The star is at a distance of 92+/-6 pc in the Lower Centaurus Crux\nassociation. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, we determined that the\ndebris is likely in the form of a dust ring with an inner edge of 27.7+2.8/-3.5\nau, position angle -74+0.5/-1.5 deg, and an inclination with respect to the\nline of sight of 6.7+3.8/-0.4 deg. The disk imaged in scattered light has a\nsurface density declining with radius like ~r^(-4), steeper than expected for\ngrain blowout by radiation pressure. We find only marginal evidence (2 sigma)\nof eccentricity, and rule out planets more massive than 1.0 Mjup orbiting\nwithin 1 au of the ring's inner edge, since such a planet would have disrupted\nthe disk. The disk has roughly the same fractional disk luminosity\n(Ldisk/L*=3.3x10^(-3)) as HR4796A and Beta Pictoris, however it was not\ndetected by previous instrument facilities most likely because of its small\nangular size (radius~0.4\"), low albedo (~0.2) and low scattering efficiency far\nfrom the star due to high scattering anisotropy. With the arrival of extreme\nadaptive optics systems like SPHERE and GPI, the morphology of smaller, fainter\nand more distant debris disks are being revealed, providing clues to\nplanet-disk interactions in young protoplanetary systems.\n", "  By comparing two expressions for the polarization function given in terms of\ntwo different local-field factors, G_+(q,iw) and G_s(q,iw), we have derived the\nkinetic-energy-fluctuation (or sixth-power) sum rule for the momentum\ndistribution function n(p) in the three-dimensional electron gas. With use of\nthis sum rule, together with the total-number (or second-power) and the\nkinetic-energy (or fourth-power) sum rules, we have obtained n(p) in the\nlow-density electron gas at negative compressibility (namely, r_s>5.25 with r_s\nbeing the conventional density parameter) up to r_s ~ 22 by improving on the\ninterpolation scheme due to Gori-Giorge and Ziesche proposed in 2002. The\nobtained results for n(p) combined with the improved form for G_s(q,w+i0^+) are\nemployed to calculate the dynamical structure factor S(q,w) to reveal that a\ngiant peak, even bigger than the plasmon peak, originating from an excitonic\ncollective mode made of electron-hole pair excitations, emerges in the low-w\nregion at q near 2p_F (p_F: the Fermi wave number). Connected with this mode,\nwe have discovered a singular point in the retarded dielectric function at w=0\nand q ~ 2p_F.\n", "  Recent experiments on ice formed by water under nanoconfinement provide\nevidence for a two-dimensional (2D) `square ice' phase. However, the\ninterpretation of the experiments has been questioned and the stability of\nsquare ice has become a matter of debate. Partially this is because the\nsimulation approaches employed so far (force fields and density functional\ntheory) struggle to accurately describe the very small energy differences\nbetween the relevant phases. Here we report a study of 2D ice using an accurate\nwave-function based electronic structure approach, namely Diffusion Monte Carlo\n(DMC). We find that at relatively high pressure square ice is indeed the lowest\nenthalpy phase examined, supporting the initial experimental claim. Moreover,\nat lower pressures a `pentagonal ice' phase (not yet observed experimentally)\nhas the lowest enthalpy, and at ambient pressure the `pentagonal ice' phase is\ndegenerate with a `hexagonal ice' phase. Our DMC results also allow us to\nevaluate the accuracy of various density functional theory exchange correlation\nfunctionals and force field models, and in doing so we extend the understanding\nof how such methodologies perform to challenging 2D structures presenting\ndangling hydrogen bonds.\n", "  In the paper a self-consistent theoretical description of the lattice and\nmagnetic properties of a model system with magnetoelastic interaction is\npresented. The dependence of magnetic exchange integrals on the distance\nbetween interacting spins is assumed, which couples the magnetic and the\nlattice subsystem. The framework is based on summation of the Gibbs free\nenergies for the lattice subsystem and magnetic subsystem. On the basis of\nminimization principle for the Gibbs energy, a set of equations of state for\nthe system is derived. These equations of state combine the parameters\ndescribing the elastic properties (relative volume deformation) and the\nmagnetic properties (magnetization changes).\n  The formalism is extensively illustrated with the numerical calculations\nperformed for a system of ferromagnetically coupled spins $S$=1/2 localized at\nthe sites of simple cubic lattice. In particular, the significant influence of\nthe magnetic subsystem on the elastic properties is demonstrated. It manifests\nitself in significant modification of such quantities as the relative volume\ndeformation, thermal expansion coefficient or isothermal compressibility, in\nparticular, in the vicinity of the magnetic phase transition. On the other\nhand, the influence of lattice subsystem on the magnetic one is also evident.\nIt takes, for example, the form of dependence of the critical (Curie)\ntemperature and magnetization itself on the external pressure, which is\nthoroughly investigated.\n", "  We investigate the properties of a static, cylindrically symmetric\nMajumdar-Papapetrou-type solution of Einstein-Maxwell equations. We locate its\nsingularities, establish its algebraic type, find its asymptotic properties and\nweak-field limit, study the structure of electrogeodesics, and determine the\nmass and charge of its sources. We provide an interpretation of the spacetime\nand discuss the parameter appearing in the metric.\n", "  We describe the design of a low- and medium-resolution spectrograph (\nR=300-1300) developed at the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian\nAcademy of Sciences (SAO RAS) for the 1.6-m AZT-33IK telescope of Sayan\nObservatory of the Institute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics of the Siberian\nBranch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. We report the results of laboratory\nmeasurements of the parameters of the instrument and tests performed on the SAO\nRAS 1-m Zeiss-1000 telescope. We measured the total quantum efficiency of the\n\"spectrograph + telescope + detector\" system on AZT-33IK telescope, which at\nits maximum reaches 56%. Such a hight transparency of the spectrograph allows\nit to be used with the 1.6-m telescope to determine the types and redshifts of\nobjects with magnitudes m_AB~20-21, that was confirmed by actual observations.\n", "  We propose and investigate a new type of metamaterial structure composing of\nseveral interpenetrating wire meshes. Calculated band structures show that they\nexhibit index ellipsoids locating at nonzero k-point in long wavelength limit.\nWe can comprehend these quasistatic modes by Poison's equation and find these\nmodes do not rely on the detailed geometry of the wires but the connectivities\nof the wires. We can engineer the locations of index ellipsoid by designing the\nconnectivities of the wire meshes.\n", "  Ordinary chondrites (OCs) are by far the most abundant meteorites (80% of all\nfalls). Their origin has long been the matter of a heated debate. About thirty\nyears ago (e.g., Pellas 1988), it was proposed that OCs should originate from\nS-type bodies (the most abundant asteroid spectral types in the inner part of\nthe asteroid belt), but the apparent discrepancy between S-type asteroid and OC\nreflectance spectra generated what was known as the S-type--OC conundrum. This\nparadox has gradually been resolved over the years. It is now understood that\nspace weathering processes are responsible for the spectral mismatch between\nS-type bodies and OCs. Furthermore, both telescopic observations and the first\nasteroid sample return mission (Hayabusa) indicate that most S-type bodies have\nmineralogies similar to those of OCs. Importantly, the S-type/OC link, which\nhas remained sterile for more than 30 years, has been delivering fundamental\nconstraints on the formation and evolution of planetesimals over the recent\nyears.\n", "  The novel generalized perturbation (n, M)-fold Darboux transformations (DTs)\nare reported for the (2+1)-dimensional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation and\nits extension by using the Taylor expansion of the Darboux matrix. The\ngeneralized perturbation (1, N-1)-fold DTs are used to find their higher-order\nrational solitons and rogue wave solutions in terms of determinants. The\ndynamics behaviors of these rogue waves are discussed in detail for different\nparameters and time, which display the interesting RW and soliton structures\nincluding the triangle, pentagon, heptagon profiles, etc. Moreover, we find\nthat a new phenomenon that the parameter (a) can control the wave structures of\nthe KP equation from the higher-order rogue waves (a>0 or a<0) into\nhigher-order rational solitons (a = 0) in (x, t)-space with y=const. These\nresults may predict the corresponding dynamical phenomena in the models of\nfluid mechanics and other physically relevant systems.\n", "  This paper presents a review of the characteristics of the multiple stellar\npopulations observed in globular clusters, and of their possible origin. The\ncurrent theoretical issues and the many open questions are discussed.\n", "  Field-effect phototransistors were fabricated based on individual carbon\nnanotubes (CNTs) sensitized by CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ nanowires (MAPbI$_3$NW).\nThese devices represent light responsivities of R=7.7x10$^5$ A/W at\nlow-lighting conditions in the nWmm$^{-2}$ range, unprecedented among CNT-based\nphoto detectors. At high incident power (~1 mWmm$^{-2}$), light soaking results\nin a negative photocurrent, the device turns insulating. We interpret the\nphenomenon as a result of efficient electron-hole separation and charge\ntransfer of holes from the perovskite to the carbon nanotube, which improves\nconductance by increasing the number of carriers, but leaves electrons behind.\nAt high illumination intensity the random electrostatic potential of these\nquench the mobility in the nanotube. The single CNT device geometry allows the\nlocal study of the MAPbI$_3$NW/CNT interface for metallic and semiconducting\nCNTs separately. Infrared and Raman spectroscopy studies of\nCNT-CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ composites revealed that photo-doping takes place at\nthe interface.\n", "  We analyze the peculiar case where the free carrier absorption arising from\nLO phonon absorption-assisted transitions becomes negative and therefore turns\ninto a gain source for quantum cascade lasers. Such an additional source of\ngain exists when the ratio between the electronic and the lattice temperatures\nis larger than one, a condition that is usually fulfilled in quantum cascade\nlasers. We find a gain of few cm$^{-1}$'s at 200K. We report the development of\na terahertz quantum cascade laser operating in the negative free carrier\nabsorption regime.\n", "  For 25 years condensed matter physicists have searched for a material that\nrealizes a macroscopic quantum state of matter, the quantum spin liquid. Recent\nexperiments show that the necessary interaction may be found in a family of\nhexagonal ruthenium based materials.\n", "  We present an experimental methodology to observe spatio-temporal\nsecond-order quantum coherence of surface plasmon polaritons which are emitted\nby nitrogen vacancy color centers attached at the apex of an optical tip. The\napproach relies on leakage radiation microscopy in the Fourier space and we use\nthis approach to test wave-particle duality for surface plasmon polaritons.\n", "  We study theoretically and experimentally coherent imaging of surface plasmon\npolaritons using either leakage radiation microscopy through a thin metal film\nor interference microscopy through a thick metal film. Using a rigorous modal\nformalism based on scalar Whittaker potentials we develop a systematic\nanalytical and vectorial method adapted to the analysis of coherent imaging\ninvolving surface plasmon polaritons. The study includes geometrical\naberrations due index mismatch which played an important role in the\ninterpretation of recent experiments using leakage radiation microscopy. We\ncompare our theory with experiments using classical or quantum near-field\nscanning optical microscopy probes and show that the approach leads to a full\ninterpretation of the recorded optical images.\n", "  We report a highly efficient generation of singular surface plasmon (SP)\nfield by an achiral plasmonic structure consisting of $\\Lambda$-shaped\napertures. Our quantitative analysis based on leakage radiation microscopy\n(LRM) demonstrates that the induced spin-orbit coupling can be tuned by\nadjusting the apex angle of the $\\Lambda$-shaped aperture. Specifically, the\narray of $\\Lambda$-shaped apertures with the apex angle $60^\\circ$ is shown to\ngive rise to the directional coupling efficiency. The ring of $\\Lambda$-shaped\napertures with the apex angle $60^\\circ$ realized to generate the maximum\nextinction ratio (ER=11) for the SP singularities between two different\npolarization states. This result provides a more efficient way for developing\nSP focusing and SP vortex in the field of nanophotonics such as optical\ntweezers.\n", "  This work shows that it is possible to calculate numerical values of the\nChandrasekhar $H$-function for isotropic scattering at least with 15-digit\naccuracy by making use of the double exponential formula (DE-formula) of\nTakahashi and Mori (Publ. RIMS, Kyoto Univ. Vol. 9, 721, 1974) instead of the\nGauss-Legendre quadrature employed in the numerical scheme of Kawabata and\nLimaye (Astrophys. Space Sci. Vol. 332, 365, 2011) and simultaneously taking a\nprecautionary measure to minimize the effects due to loss of significant digits\nparticularly in the cases of near-conservative scattering and/or errors\ninvolved in returned values of library functions supplied by compilers in use.\nThe results of our calculations are presented for 18 selected values of single\nscattering albedo $\\varpi_0$ and 22 values of an angular variable $\\mu$, the\ncosine of zenith angle $\\theta$ specifying the direction of radiation incident\non or emergent from semi-infinite media.\n", "  de la Pe\\~na 1980 and Puthoff 1987 show that circular orbits in the hydrogen\nproblem of Stochastic Electrodynamics are stable. Though the Cole-Zou 2003\nsimulations support the stability, our recent numerics always lead to\nself-ionisation. Here the de la Pe\\~na-Puthoff argument is extended to elliptic\norbits. For very eccentric orbits with energy close to zero and angular\nmomentum below some not-small value, there is on the average a net gain in\nenergy for each revolution, which explains the self-ionisation. Next, an\n$1/r^2$ potential is added, which could stem from a dipolar deformation of the\nnuclear charge by the electron at its moving position. This shape retains the\nanalytical solvability. When it is enough repulsive, the ground state of this\nmodified hydrogen problem is predicted to be stable. The same conclusions hold\nfor positronium.\n", "  In this work we propose the application of an enhanced radiation damage model\nbased on the introduction of deep level traps / recombination centers suitable\nfor device level numerical simulation of silicon detectors at very high\nfluences (e.g. 2.0x10E16 1 MeV equivalent neutrons/cm2). We present the\ncomparison between simulation results and experimental data for p-type\nsubstrate structures in different operating conditions (temperature and biasing\nvoltages) for fluences up to 2.2x10E16 neutrons/cm2. The good agreement between\nsimulation findings and experimental measurements fosters the application of\nthis modeling scheme to the optimization of the next silicon detectors to be\nused at HL-LHC.\n", "  We explore via spectroscopic modeling whether the highly correlated diffuse\ninterstellar bands at 6613.6 and 6196.0 {\\AA} might originate from a single\nmolecule. Efforts were made to simulate the band contours of the DIBs along the\nthree lines-of-sight, which have been observed by others at high resolution:\nHD179406, HD174165, and Her 36. Reasonable simultaneous fits were obtained\nusing a prolate symmetric top molecule that exhibits transitions of two\ndifferent band types, type-a parallel and type-b perpendicular bands. Two\ndifferent excited states of a long- or heavy-chain, forked molecule are\nproposed. A minimum number of adjustable parameters were used including ground\nand excited state A and B rotational constants, an excited state centrifugal\ndistortion constant, and three different rotational excitation temperatures.\nPoints in favor and against the hypothesis are discussed.\n", "  Small near-Earth asteroids (>20 meters) are interesting because they are\nprogenitors for meteorites in our terrestrial collection. Crucial to our\nunderstanding of the effectiveness of our atmosphere in filtering low-strength\nimpactors is the physical characteristics of these small near-Earth asteroids\n(NEAs). In the past, characterization of small NEAs has been a challenge\nbecause of the difficulty in detecting them prior to close Earth flyby. In this\nstudy we physically characterized the 2-meter diameter near-Earth asteroid 2015\nTC25 using ground-based optical, near-infrared and radar assets during a close\nflyby of the Earth (distance 69,000 miles) in Oct. 2015. Our observations\nsuggest that its surface composition is similar to aubrites, a rare class of\nhigh albedo differentiated meteorites. Aubrites make up only 0.14 % of all know\nmeteorites in our terrestrial meteorite collection. 2015 TC25 is also a very\nfast rotator with a rotation period of 133 seconds. We compared spectral and\ndynamical properties of 2015 TC25 and found the best candidate source body in\nthe inner main belt to be the 70-km diameter E-type asteroid (44) Nysa. We\nattribute difference in spectral slope between the two objects to the lack of\nregolith on the surface of 2015 TC25. Using the albedo of E-type asteroids\n(50-60%) we refine the diameter of 2015 TC25 to 2-meters making it one of the\nsmallest NEA ever to be characterized.\n", "  A model of key processes influencing the evolution of a hydrocarbon grain of\nan arbitrary size under astrophysical conditions corresponding to ionized\nhydrogen regions (HII regions) and supernova remnants is presented. The\nconsidered processes include aromatization and photodestruction, sputtering by\nelectrons and ions, and shattering due to collisions between grains. The model\ncan be used to simulate the grain size distribution and the aromatization\ndegree during the evolution of HII regions and supernova remnants for a\nspecified radiation field, relative velocity of gas and dust, etc. The\ncontribution of various processes to the evolution of hydrocarbon dust grains\nfor parameters typical for the interstellar medium of our Galaxy is presented.\nSmall grains (less than 50 carbon atoms) should be fully aromatized in the\ngeneral interstellar medium. If larger grains initially have an aliphatic\nstructure, it is preserved to a substantial extent. Variations in the size\ndistribution of the grains due to their mutual collisions depend appreciably on\nthe adopted initial size distribution. For the MRN initial distribution a\nsignificant redistribution of grain sizes is obtained, which increases the mass\nfraction of smaller grains. Characteristic for an initial distribution from the\nwork of Jones et al. (2013), with high initial fraction of small grains, is a\ngeneral decrease in the number of grains of all sizes.\n", "  We present evolutionary calculations for the size and aromatization degree\ndistributions of interstellar dust grains, driven by their destruction by\nradiation, collisions with gas particles, and shattering due to grain-grain\ncollisions. Based on these calculations we model dust emission spectra. The\ninitial grain size distribution play the important role in the evolution of an\nensemble of dust particles. Radiation in the considered intensity range mostly\naromatizes grains. The smallest grains are mainly destructed via sputtering by\ncollisions with gas particles. There are no grains smaller than 20~\\AA\\ in the\nmedium at relative gas-dust velocities more than 50~km/s, which is typical for\nshocks in supernova remnants. The IR emission spectrum changes significantly\ndue to the dust evolution depending on the adopted grain properties, in\nparticular, on the energy of the C--C bonds ($E_0$). Aromatic bands in the\nnear-IR (2--15~$\\mu$m) are absent, if $E_0$ is low, even when the medium\nproperties correspond to the average interstellar medium in our Galaxy. As in\nreality these bands are observed, high $E_0$ values are more preferable. We\nconsider dependence of the emission intensity ratios for various photometric\nbands on the medium properties. The aromatization degree of small grains shows\nup most strongly in the $I_{3.4}/I_{11.3}$ intensity ratio while the fraction\nof aromatic grains in the total dust mass influences the $I_{3.3}/I_{70+160}$\nratio.\n", "  Recent investigations indicate that solar coronal jets result from eruptions\nof small-scale chromospheric filaments, called minifilaments; that is, the jets\nare produced by scaled-down versions of typical-sized filament eruptions. We\nconsider whether solar spicules might in turn be scaled-down versions of\ncoronal jets, being driven by eruptions of \"microfilaments.\" Assuming a\nmicrofilament's size is about a spicule's width ($\\sim$300~km), the estimated\noccurrence number plotted against the estimated size of erupting filaments,\nminifilaments, and microfilaments approximately follows a power-law\ndistribution (based on counts of CMEs, coronal jets, and spicules), suggesting\nthat many or most spicules could result from microfilament eruptions. Observed\nspicule-base Ca II brightenings plausibly result from such microfilament\neruptions. By analogy with coronal jets, microfilament eruptions might produce\nspicules with many of their observed characteristics, including smooth rise\nprofiles, twisting motions, and EUV counterparts. The postulated microfilament\neruptions are presumably eruptions of twisted-core micro magnetic bipoles that\nare $\\sim$1$\".0$ wide. These explosive bipoles might be built and destabilized\nby merging and cancelation of magnetic-flux elements of $\\sim$few$\\times 100$~G\nand of size <~$0\".5$---$1\".0$. If however spicules are relatively more numerous\nthan indicated by our extrapolated distribution, then only a fraction of\nspicules might result from this proposed mechanism.\n", "  In this paper, I qualitatively discuss the matter formed in the fragmentation\nregion of nuclear collisions at the highest energies. I argue that although the\ninitial temperature and baryon number density can become very large, the ratio\nof initial baryon chemical potential to initial temperature is approximately\nindependent of energy, when measured at a fixed rapidity measured from the end\nof the fragmentation region. This quantity is argued to be roughly invariant\nunder expansion, and therefore the value measured at decoupling should be\napproximately the same as the initial value and largely independent of energy.\nThe values of the initial temperature and initial baryon number are energy\ndependent and become large as the center of mass collision energy increases.\n", "  In this paper we analyze the fundamental solution of the \\textit{quantum\ndifference equation} (qde) for the moduli space of instantons on\ntwo-dimensional projective space. The qde is a $K$-theoretic generalization of\nthe quantum differential equation in quantum cohomology. As in the quantum\ncohomology case, the fundamental solution of qde provides the capping operator\nin $K$-theory (the rubber part of the capped vertex). We study the dependence\nof the capping operator on the equivariant parameters $a_i$ of the torus acting\non the instanton moduli space by changing the framing. We prove that the\ncapping operator factorizes at $a_i\\to 0$. The rationality of the $K$-theoretic\n1-leg capped descendent vertex follows from factorization of the capping\noperator as a simple corollary.\n", "  This paper presents $\\textit{Herschel}$/SPIRE spectroscopic observations of\nseveral fundamental rotational ortho- and para-water transitions seen in three\nJupiter-family comets and one Oort-cloud comet. Radiative transfer models that\ninclude excitation by collisions with neutrals and electrons, and by solar\ninfrared radiation were used to produce synthetic emission line profiles\noriginating in the cometary coma. Ortho-to-para ratios (OPRs) were determined\nand used to derived water production rates for all comets. Comparisons are made\nwith the water production rates derived using an OPR of 3.\n  The OPR of three of the comets in this study are much lower than the\nstatistical equilibrium value of 3, however they agree with observations of\ncomets 1P/Halley and C/2001 A2 (LINEAR), and the protoplanetary disc TW Hydrae.\nThese results provide evidence suggesting that OPR variation is caused by\npost-sublimation gas-phase nuclear-spin conversion processes. The water\nproduction rates of all comets agree with previous work and, in general,\ndecrease with increasing nucleocentric offset. This could be due to a\ntemperature profile, additional water source, or OPR variation in the comae, or\nmodel inaccuracies.\n", "  We present a study on the stellar age and metallicity distributions for 1105\ngalaxies using the STARLIGHT software on MaNGA integral field spectra. We\nderive age and metallicity gradients by fitting straight lines to the radial\nprofiles, and explore their correlations with total stellar mass M*, NUV-r\ncolour and environments, as identified by both the large scale structure (LSS)\ntype and the local density. We find that the mean age and metallicity gradients\nare close to zero but slightly negative, which is consistent with the\ninside-out formation scenario. Within our sample, we find that both the age and\nmetallicity gradients show weak or no correlation with either the LSS type or\nlocal density environment. In addition, we also study the environmental\ndependence of age and metallicity values at the effective radii. The age and\nmetallicity values are highly correlated with M* and NUV-r and are also\ndependent on LSS type as well as local density. Low-mass galaxies tend to be\nyounger and have lower metallicity in low-density environments while high-mass\ngalaxies are less affected by environment.\n", "  Courant algebroids are a natural generalization of quadratic Lie algebras,\nappearing in various contexts in mathematical physics. A connection on a\nCourant algebroid gives an analogue of a covariant derivative compatible with a\ngiven fiber-wise metric. Imposing further conditions resembling standard\nLevi-Civita connections, one obtains a class of connections whose curvature\ntensor in certain cases gives a new geometrical description of equations of\nmotion of low energy effective action of string theory. Two examples are given.\nOne is the so called symplectic gravity, the second one is an application to\nthe the so called heterotic reduction. All necessary definitions, propositions\nand theorems are given in a detailed and self-contained way.\n", "  Missing bound-state solutions for fermions in the background of a Killingbeck\nradial potential including an external magnetic and Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux\nfields are examined. The correct quadratic form of the Dirac equation with\nvector and scalar couplings under the spin and pseudo-spin symmetries is showed\nand also we point out a misleading treatment in the literature regarding to\nbound-state solutions for this problem.\n", "  Cross-protection, which refers to a process whereby artificially inoculating\na plant with a mild strain provides protection against a more aggressive\nisolate of the virus, is known to be an effective tool of disease control in\nplants. In this paper we derive and analyse a new mathematical model of the\ninteractions between two competing viruses with particular account for RNA\ninterference. Our results show that co-infection of the host can either\nincrease or decrease the potency of individual infections depending on the\nlevels of cross-protection or cross-enhancement between different viruses.\nAnalytical and numerical bifurcation analyses are employed to investigate the\nstability of all steady states of the model in order to identify parameter\nregions where the system exhibits synergistic or antagonistic behaviour between\nviral strains, as well as different types of host recovery. We show that not\nonly viral attributes but also the propagating component of RNA-interference in\nplants can play an important role in determining the dynamics.\n", "  We demonstrate that, if a truncated expansion of a wave function is Large,\nthen the standard excited states computational method, of optimizing one root\nof a secular equation, according to the theorem of Hylleraas, Undheim and\nMcDonald (HUM), tends to the correct excited wave function, comparable to that\nobtained via our proposed minimization principle for excited states [J. Comput.\nMeth. Sci. Eng. 8, 277 (2008)] (independent of orthogonality to lower lying\napproximants). However, if a truncated expansion of a wave function is Small -\nthat would be desirable for large systems - then the HUM-based methods may lead\nto an incorrect wave function - despite the correct energy (: according to the\nHUM theorem) whereas our method leads to correct, reliable, albeit Small\ntruncated wave functions. The demonstration is done in He excited states, using\ntruncated series Small expansions both in Hylleraas coordinates, and via\nstandard configuration-interaction truncated Small expansions, in comparison\nwith corresponding Large expansions. Beyond that, we give some examples of\nlinear combinations of Hamiltonian eigenfunctions that have the energy of the\n1st excited state, albeit they are orthogonal to it, demonstrating that the\ncorrect energy is not a criterion of correctness of the wave function.\n", "  Despite the numerous successful applications of lattice QCD in nuclear and\nparticle theory, fundamental algorithmic challenges remain. Among those,\nrelevant for numerical studies of QCD on a space-time torus, is topological\nfreezing--a form of critical slowing down, which becomes particularly acute for\nlattice spacings less than 0.05 fm. In these proceedings, I highlight several\nrecently proposed simulation strategies for ameliorating the problem of\ntopological freezing, and discuss both their advantages and disadvantages.\nThen, I turn focus toward potential strategies for addressing critical slowing\ndown in a more general context.\n", "  Recently, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and Virgo Collaboration published\nthe second observation on gravitational wave GW151226 [Phys. Rev. Lett. 116,\n241103 (2016)] from the binary black hole coalescence with initial masses about\n14 M$_\\odot$ and 8 M$_\\odot$. They claimed that the peak gravitational strain\nwas reached at about 450 Hz, the inverse of which has been longer than the\naverage time a photon staying in the Fabry-Perot cavities in two arms. In this\ncase, the phase-difference of a photon in the two arms due to the propagation\nof gravitational wave does not always increase as the photon stays in the\ncavities. It might even be cancelled to zero in extreme cases. When the\npropagation effect is taken into account, we find that the claimed signal\nGW151226 would almost disappear.\n", "  Proposals for studying topological superconductivity and Majorana bound\nstates in nanowires proximity coupled to superconductors require that transport\nin the nanowire is ballistic. Previous work on hybrid nanowire-superconductor\nsystems has shown evidence for Majorana bound states, but these experiments\nwere also marked by disorder, which disrupts ballistic transport. In this\nletter, we demonstrate ballistic transport in InSb nanowires interfaced\ndirectly with superconducting Al by observing quantized conductance at\nzero-magnetic field. Additionally, we demonstrate that the nanowire is\nproximity coupled to the superconducting contacts by observing Andreev\nreflection. These results are important steps for robustly establishing\ntopological superconductivity in InSb nanowires.\n", "  Recently, we showed experimentally that light carrying orbital angular\nmomentum experiences a slight subluminality under free-space propagation [1].\nWe thank Saari [2] for pointing out an apparent discrepancy between our\ntheoretical results and the well-known results for the simple case of\nLaguerre-Gauss modes. In this reply, we note that the resolution of this\napparent discrepancy is the distinction between Laguerre-Gauss modes and\nHypergeometric-Gauss modes, which were used in our experiment and in our\ntheoretical analysis, which gives rise to different subluminal effects.\n", "  Atomic dynamics takes a fundamental part in numbers of physical properties of\nsolids like high-Tc superconductivity, semiconducting transports, and\nthermoelectricity. Perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 exhibits outstanding photovoltaic\nperformances, but the exact physical scenario has not been established yet, due\nto the inadequate understanding of the atomic dynamics and exceptional\ntransport properties. We present a complete atomic dynamic picture consisting\nof phonons, rotational modes of protons and molecular vibrational modes, which\nis constructed by carrying out high-resolution time-of-flight inelastic neutron\nscattering measurements in a wide energy window ranging from 0.0036 to 54 meV\non a large single crystal sample. A three-fold rotational mode of protons\nactivated around 80 K reduces the lifetimes of acoustic and optical phonons\ndown to about 4.5 ps and below 1 ps at 150 K, respectively. The orthorhombic to\ntetragonal phase transition takes place with a slower four-fold rotational mode\nof the C-N axis concomitantly setting in at ~ 165 K, above which the optical\nphonons are too broadened to be distinguished whereas the acoustic ones are\nstill robust. The significantly reduced lifetimes of optical phonons are linked\nto the smaller mobility of charge carriers while the ultralow lattice thermal\nconductivity is attributed to nanoscale mean free paths of acoustic phonons.\nThese microscopic insights provide a solid standing point, on which perovskite\nsolar cells can be understood more accurately and their performances are\nperhaps further optimized. The revealed rotor-phonon coupling opens up an\nemergent opportunity to create unprecedented functionalities of materials.\n", "  An organic-inorganic halide perovskite of CH3NH3SnI3 with significantly\nimproved structural stability is obtained via pressure-induced amorphization\nand recrystallization. In situ high-pressure resistance measurements reveal an\nincreased electrical conductivity by 300% in the pressure-treated perovskite.\nPhotocurrent measurements also reveal a substantial enhancement in\nvisible-light responsiveness. The mechanism underlying the enhanced properties\nis demonstrated to be associated with the improved structural stability.\n", "  Correlation functions are often employed to quantify the relationships among\ninterdependent variables or sets of data. Recently, a new class of correlation\nfunctions, called Forrelation, has been introduced by Aaronson and Ambainis for\nstudying the query complexity of quantum devices. It was found that there\nexists a quantum query algorithm solving 2-fold Forrelation problems with an\nexponential quantum speedup over all possible classical means, which represents\nessentially the largest possible separation between quantum and classical query\ncomplexities. Here we report an experimental study probing the 2-fold and\n3-fold Forrelations encoded in nuclear spins. The major experimental challenge\nis to control the spin fluctuation to within a threshold value, which is\nachieved by developing a set of optimized GRAPE pulse sequences. Overall, our\nsmall-scale implementation indicates that the quantum query algorithm is\ncapable of determine the values of Forrelations within an acceptable accuracy\nrequired for demonstrating quantum supremacy, given the current technology and\nin the presence of experimental noise.\n", "  Quantum enhanced sensing provides a powerful tool for the precise measurement\nof physical parameters that is applicable in many areas of science and\ntechnology. The achievable gain in sensitivity is largely limited by the\ninfluence of noise and decoherence. Here, we propose a paradigm of adiabatic\nquantum parameter amplification to overcome this limitation. We demonstrate\nthat it allows to achieve generic robust quantum sensing, namely it is robust\nagainst noise that may even acting on the same degree of freedom as the field.\nFurthermore, the proposal achieves entanglement-free Heisenberg limit\nsensitivity that surpasses the limit of classical statistics.\n", "  The Higgs boson discovered at the LHC in 2012 has been observed coupling\ndirectly to $W$ and $Z$ bosons and to $\\tau$ leptons, and indirectly to top\nquarks. In order to probe whether it is indeed the particle predicted by the\nStandard Model, direct couplings of the Higgs boson to quarks must also be\nmeasured. The Higgs boson decays most often to a pair of bottom quarks (with a\nbranching ratio of 58%). When the Higgs boson is produced alone in gluon-gluon\nfusion, the signal in this decay mode is overwhelmed by the regular multi-jet\nbackground. By requiring the Higgs boson to be produced in association with a\nvector boson $V$ ($W$ or $Z$), which is further required to decay leptonically,\ndata events can be selected using charged-lepton or missing transverse energy\ntriggers. The Tevatron experiments presented combined results showing evidence\nfor the $VH(b\\bar{b})$ process at a significance level of about 3 standard\ndeviations, while the combined LHC results from Run-1 data show a 2.6 standard\ndeviation evidence for the $H\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ decay mode. In this poster,\nthe ATLAS $VH(b\\bar{b})$ search using Run-2 data is summarised.\n", "  We investigate Abelian and monopole contributions to spatial string tension\nin the deconfined phase of finite temperature SU(2) gauge theory without\nimposing any gauge fixing conditions. Lattice calculations of non-Abelian and\nAbelian spatial string tensions from the Wilson action at gauge coupling\n$\\beta=2.74$ and lattice volume $24^3\\times{N_t}$ $(N_{t}=\\left\\{\n24,8,6,4,2)\\right\\}$ show that these string tensions agree with each other\nwithin error bars at any adopted value of $N_t$, which implies Abelian\ndominance. From measurements of non-Abelian, Abelian, and monopole forces that\narise from the corresponding spatial string tension, furthermore, we find the\ntendency that the monopole contribution to the spatial string tension can be\nalmost as large as the non-Abelian and Abelian ones. The temperature dependence\nof the calculated non-Abelian and Abelian spatial string tensions allows us to\nconclude that the concept of dimensional reduction holds both for non-Abelian\nand Abelian sectors at temperatures higher than twice the critical temperature.\n", "  In chiral sum frequency generation (C-SFG), the chiral nature of\n${\\chi}^{(2)}$ requires the three involved electric fields to be pairwise\nnon-parallel, leading to the traditional non-collinear configuration which is a\nhindrance for achieving diffraction limited resolution while utilizing it as a\nlabel-free imaging contrast mechanism . Here we propose a collinear C-SFG\n(CC-SFG) microscopy modality by using longitudinal z-polarized vectorial field.\nLabel-free chiral imaging with enhanced spatial resolution (~1.4 times\nimprovement in one lateral and the longitudinal directions over the traditional\nnon-collinear scheme) is demonstrated, providing a new path for SFG microscopy\nwith diffraction-limited resolution for mapping chirality.\n", "  We report extensive resistivity, Hall, and magnetoresistance measurements on\nthin films of the electron-doped cuprate \\PCCO~(PCCO), as a function of doping,\ntemperature and magnetic field. The doping dependence of the resistivity and\nHall number at low temperatures are characteristic of a system near a quantum\nphase transition or a Fermi Surface Reconstruction (FSR) point. The spin\nmagnetoresistance drops to zero near the critical point. The data presented in\nthis paper were compiled during the 2004-2007 period but were never published\nin this comprehensive form. Because of the recent interest in very similar\nresults now being found in the normal state of hole-doped cuprates, we believe\nthe results of our older, mostly unpublished, work will be of interest to the\npresent community of cuprate researchers. In particular, Fig.11 shows the large\nchange in Hall number at the FSR point in \\PCCO, similar to that found recently\nin YBCO and LSCO (See ref[1] and [2]). Also, Fig.6 illustrates how the\nresistivity upturn is affected by the FSR. The cause of the resistivity upturn\nhas been attributed to the loss of carriers at doping below the FSR in the\nhole-doped cuprates (see Ref. 3), however, this scenario does not explain the\ndata for PCCO. The upturn in n-doped cuprates is more-likely due to a\ncombination of carrier decrease and a change in the scattering rate below the\nFSR (see also Ref. 4). The change in spin scattering below the FSR is\nillustrated by Fig.18 in this paper. Chen et al. [5] have developed a model\nbased on spin scattering that is able to explain qualitatively the resistivity\nupturn in all the cuprates.\n", "  We study pairing states in an largely imbalanced two-component Fermi gas\nloaded in an anisotropic two-dimensional optical lattice, where the spin up and\nspin down fermions filled to the $s$- and $p_x$-orbital bands, respectively. We\nshow that due to the relative inversion of band structures of the $s$ and $p_x$\norbitals, the system favors pairing between two fermions on the same side of\nthe Brillouin zone, leading to a large stable regime for states with finite\ncenter-of-mass momentum, i.e., the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO)\nstate. In particular, when the two Fermi surfaces are close in momentum space,\na nesting effect stabilizes a special kind of $\\pi$-FFLO phase with spatial\nmodulation of $\\pi$ along the easily tunneled $x$-direction. We map out the\nzero temperature phase diagrams within mean-field approach for various aspect\nratio within the two-dimensional plane, and calculate the\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition temperatures $T_{\\rm BKT}$ for\ndifferent phases.\n", "  Linear response theory is a tool with which one can study systems that are\ndriven out of equilibrium by external perturbations. This monograph presents a\nthoroughly modern framework to make linear response theory rigorous for a wide\narray of systems, that is suitable for novel applications such as periodic and\nrandom light conductors not yet covered in the literature. Our\nanalytic-algebraic approach, based on von Neumann algebras and associated\nnon-commutative $L^p$-spaces, can deal with discrete and continuous models\nalike, and include effects of disorder. First, we explain the mathematical\nsetting, give a complete list of our hypotheses and state the main results,\nwhich include Kubo and Kubo-Streda formulas. To make our book accessible to a\nwide audience, we spend Chapters 3 and 4 explaining the mathematical\nunderpinnings such as non-commutative $L^p$- and Sobolev spaces, and\ngeneralized commutators. Furthermore, we show how to construct a von Neumann\nalgebras from a topological dynamical system and a 2-cocycle, a procedure which\napplies to discrete and continuous quantum systems. We dedicate Chapters 5 and\n6 to the proofs of our main results. We close the book by sketching a novel\napplication, linear response theory for periodic and random light conductors.\nThis monograph is aimed at advanced students in mathematical physics and\nresearchers.\n", "  Biological signaling is imagined as a combination of activation and\ntransport. The former is triggered by local molecular interactions and the\nlatter is the result of molecular diffusion. However, other fundamental\nphysical principles of communication have yet to be addressed. We have recently\nshown, that lipid interfaces allow for the excitation and propagation of sound\npulses. Here we demonstrate, that these reversible perturbations can control\nthe activity of membrane embedded enzymes without the necessity of molecular\ntransport. They therefore allow for the rapid communication between distant\nbiological entities (e.g. receptor and enzyme) at the speed of sound, which is\nhere in the order of 1 m/s within the membrane. The mechanism reported provides\na new physical framework for biological signaling.\n", "  The response of the nonlinear shallow water equations (SWE) on a sphere to\ntropical vorticity forcing is examined with an emphasis on momentum fluxes and\nthe emergence of a superrotating (SR) state. Fixing the radiative damping and\nmomentum drag timescales to be of the order of a few days, a state of SR is\nshown to emerge under steady large-scale and random small-scale vorticity\nforcing. In the first example, the stationary response to a pair of equal and\noppositely signed vortices placed on the equator is considered. Here, the\nequatorial flux budget is dominated by the eddy fluxes and these drive the\nsystem into a state of SR. Eventually, the flux associated with the momentum\ndrag increases to balance the eddy fluxes, resulting in a steady state with a\nSR jet at the equator. The initial value problem with these twin vortices also\nexhibits SR driven by eddy fluxes. Curiously, this transient solution\nspontaneously propagates westward and continually circumnavigates the globe. It\nis worth emphasizing that this SR state does not rely on any particular form of\ndissipation at large scales, and is in fact observed even in the absence of any\nlarge-scale damping mechanism. In the second example, a random small-scale\nvorticity forcing is applied across the tropics. The statistically steady state\nobtained is fairly turbulent in nature, but here too, the eddy fluxes dominate,\nand the system exhibits SR. It is important to note that in both these cases,\nthe direct forcing of the zonal mean zonal flow is zero by construction, and\nthe eddy fluxes at the equator are responsible for its eastward acceleration.\nFurther, in both these examples, the rotational part of the flow dominates the\nmomentum fluxes as well as the stationary zonal mean zonal flow itself.\nArguments based on the nature of potential vorticity and enstrophy are put\nforth to shed some light on these results.\n", "  In the conceptual framework of phase ordering after temperature quenches\nbelow transition, we consider the underdamped Bales-Gooding-type 'momentum\nconserving' dynamics of a 2D martensitic structural transition from a\nsquare-to-rectangle unit cell. The one-component or $N_{\\rm OP} =1$ order\nparameter is one of the physical strains, and the Landau free energy has a\ntriple well, describing a first-order transition. We numerically study the\nevolution of the strain-strain correlation, and find that it exhibits dynamical\nscaling, with a coarsening length $L(t) \\sim t^{\\alpha}$. We find at\nintermediate and long times that the coarsening exponent sequentially takes on\nrespective values close to $\\alpha=2/3$ and $\\alpha=1/2$. For deep quenches,\nthe coarsening can be arrested at long times, with $\\alpha \\simeq 0$. These\nexponents are also found in 3D. To understand such behaviour, we insert a\ndynamical-scaling ansatz into the correlation function dynamics to give, at a\ndominant scaled separation, a nonlinear kinetics of the curvature $g (t) \\equiv\n1/ L(t)$. The curvature solutions have time windows of power-law decays $g \\sim\n1/t^\\alpha$, with exponent values $\\alpha$ matching simulations, and manifestly\nindependent of spatial dimension. Applying this curvature-kinetics method to\nmass-conserving Cahn-Hilliard dynamics for a double-well Landau potential in a\nscalar $N_{\\rm OP}=1$ order parameter yields exponents $\\alpha = 1/4$ and $1/3$\nfor intermediate and long times. For vector order parameters with $N_{\\rm OP}\n\\geq 2$, the exponents are $\\alpha = 1/4$ only, consistent with previous work.\nThe curvature kinetics method could be useful in extracting coarsening\nexponents for other phase-ordering dynamics.\n", "  The force on electric and magnetic dipoles moving in vacuo is discussed in\nthe general case of time-variable non-uniform fields and time-variable dipole\nmoments, to first order in v/c and neglecting radiation reaction. Emphasis is\ngiven to the symmetry between electric and magnetic dipoles, justifying in\ngeneral Amp\\`ere's equivalence principle, and showing that the difference\nbetween gilbertian and amperian dipoles (in vacuo) is only a question of\ninterpretation. The expression for the force can be expressed in a variety of\ndifferent forms, and each term of each form is susceptible of specific physical\ninterpretations. Terms not described in the literature are pointed out. A\npossible experiment for verifying the (dual-Lorentz) force of an electric field\non a magnetic current (and then \"hidden momentum\") is proposed.\n", "  We prove asymptotic formulas of Szeg\\H{o} type for the periodic Schr\\\"odinger\noperator $H=-\\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+V$ in dimension one. Admitting fairly general\nfunctions $h$ with $h(0)=0$, we study the trace of the operator\n$h(\\chi_{(-\\alpha,\\alpha)}\\chi_{(-\\infty,\\mu)}(H)\\chi_{(-\\alpha,\\alpha)})$ and\nlink its subleading behaviour as $\\alpha\\to\\infty$ to the position of the\nspectral parameter $\\mu$ relative to the spectrum of $H$.\n", "  The complex structure of the Salvinia molesta is investigated via rare event\nmolecular dynamics simulations. Results show that a hydrophilic/hydrophobic\npatterning together with a re-entrant geometry control the free energy barriers\nfor bubble nucleation and for the Cassie-Wenzel transition. This natural\nparadigm is translated into simple macroscopic design criteria for engineering\nrobust superhydrophobicity in submerged applications.\n", "  In this contribution we study wetting and nucleation of vapor bubbles on\nnanodecorated surfaces via free energy molecular dynamics simulations. The\nresults shed light on the stability of superhydrophobicity in submerged\nsurfaces with nanoscale corrugations. The re-entrant geometry of the cavities\nunder investigation is capable of sustaining a confined vapor phase within the\nsurface roughness (Cassie state) both for hydrophobic and hydrophilic\ncombinations of liquid and solid. The atomistic system is of nanometric size;\non this scale thermally activated events can play an important role ultimately\ndetermining the lifetime of the Cassie state. Such superhydrophobic state can\nbreak down by full wetting of the texture at large pressures (Cassie-Wenzel\ntransition) or by nucleating a vapor bubble at negative pressures (cavitation).\nSpecialized rare event techniques show that several pathways for wetting and\ncavitation are possible, due to the complex surface geometry. The related free\nenergy barriers are of the order of 100 k_B T and vary with pressure. The\natomistic results are found to be in semi-quantitative accord with macroscopic\ncapillarity theory. However, the latter is not capable of capturing the density\nfluctuations, which determine the destabilization of the confined liquid phase\nat negative pressures (liquid spinodal).\n", "  We summarize a comparison of the two strategies which are currently available\nin the literature for determining the value of $\\alpha_s(m_\\tau)$. We will\nrefer to these as the truncated Operator Product Expansion model and the\nDuality Violation model. After describing the main features of both approaches,\nwe explain why the former fails to pass crucial tests. The latter, on the other\nhand, passes all the tests known up to date and, therefore, should be currently\nconsidered the only reliable method.\n", "  We investigated a peculiar metric type II solar radio burst with a broken\nlane structure, which was observed on November 13, 2012. In addition to the\nradio data, we also studied the data in the other wavelengths. The bursts were\nassociated with two CMEs and two flares that originated from active region AR\n11613. A long current sheet was developed in the first CME, and the second CME\ncollided with the current sheet first and then merged with the first one.\nCombing information revealed by the multi-wavelength data indicated that a\ncoronal shock accounting for the type II radio burst, and that the collision of\nthis shock with the current sheet resulted in the broken lane of the type II\nradio burst. The type II burst lane resumed after the shock passed through the\ncurrent sheet. We further estimated the thickness of the current sheet\naccording to the gap on the lane of the type II burst, and found that the\nresult is consistent with previous ones obtained for various events observed in\ndifferent wavelengths by different instruments. In addition, the regular type\nII burst associated with the first CME/flare was also studied, and the magnetic\nfield in each source region of the two type II bursts was further deduced in\ndifferent way.\n", "  Measurements of normalized differential cross-sections of top quark pair\n($t\\bar t$) production are presented as a function of the mass, the transverse\nmomentum and the rapidity of the $t\\bar t$ system in proton-proton collisions\nat center-of-mass energies of $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV and 8 TeV. The dataset\ncorresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb$^{-1}$ at 7 TeV and 20.2\nfb$^{-1}$ at 8 TeV, recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron\nCollider. Events with top quark pair signatures are selected in the dilepton\nfinal state, requiring exactly two charged leptons and at least two jets with\nat least one of the jets identified as likely to contain a $b$-hadron. The\nmeasured distributions are corrected for detector effects and selection\nefficiency to cross-sections at the parton level. The differential\ncross-sections are compared with different Monte Carlo generators and\ntheoretical calculations of $t\\bar t$ production. The results are consistent\nwith the majority of predictions in a wide kinematic range.\n", "  In this paper we propose and study direct single top quark production channel\nfor probing the tq$\\gamma$ flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) interactions\nat the LHC. We reinterpret the experimental results of a search for direct\nsingle top quark production performed by ATLAS collaboration at 8 TeV to set\nupper bounds on the FCNC top quark decay branching fractions through the\nproposed channel, resulting in ${\\cal B}$(t$\\rightarrow$ u$\\gamma$) $<$ 0.05\\%\nand ${\\cal B}$(t$\\rightarrow$ c$\\gamma$) $<$ 0.14\\%. Finally, the expected\nsensitivity at 13 TeV for various integrated luminosity scenarios is estimated.\n", "  Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) represents one of the\nmost fascinating challenges in quantum communication, exploiting concepts of\nfundamental physics, namely Bell tests of nonlocality, to ensure the security\nof a communication link. This requires the loophole-free violation of a Bell\ninequality, which is intrinsically difficult due to losses in fibre optic\ntransmission channels. Heralded photon amplification is a teleportation-based\nprotocol that has been proposed as a means to overcome transmission loss for\nDI-QKD. Here we demonstrate heralded photon amplification for path entangled\nstates and characterise the entanglement before and after loss by exploiting a\nrecently developed displacement-based detection scheme. We demonstrate that by\nexploiting heralded photon amplification we are able to reliably maintain high\nfidelity entangled states over loss-equivalent distances of more than 50~km.\n", "  In any quantum theory of gravity, it is of the utmost importance to recover\nthe limit of quantum theory in an external spacetime. In quantum\ngeometrodynamics (quantization of general relativity in the Schr\\\"odinger\npicture), this leads in particular to the recovery of a semiclassical (WKB)\ntime which governs the dynamics of non-gravitational fields in spacetime. Here,\nwe first review this procedure with special emphasis on conceptual issues. We\nthen turn to an alternative theory - Weyl (conformal) gravity, which is defined\nby a Lagrangian that is proportional to the square of the Weyl tensor. We\npresent the canonical quantization of this theory and develop its semiclassical\napproximation. We discuss in particular the extent to which a semiclassical\ntime can be recovered and contrast it with the situation in quantum\ngeometrodynamics.\n", "  Spontaneous mirror symmetry violation is carried out in nature as the\ntransition between the usual left (right)-handed and the mirror right\n(left)-handed spaces, where the same particle has the different lifetimes. As a\nconsequence, all the equations of motion for the unified field theory of\nelementary particles include the mass, energy and momentum as the matrices\nexpressing the ideas of the left- and right-handed neutrinos are of long- and\nshort-lived objects, respectively. These ideas require in principle to go away\nfrom the chiral definitions of the structure of matter fields taking into\naccount that the Dirac matrices come forward in the Weyl presentation as the\nmatrices having an exact mathematical formulation but not allowing to follow\nthe logic of a true nature of mirror symmetry including the dynamical\norigination of its spontaneous violation. Therefore, from the point of view of\nthe mass, energy and momentum matrices, each of the structural contradictions\nbetween the spontaneous mirror symmetry violation and the chiral presentation\nof the Weyl must be interpreted as an indication to the absence in nature of a\nplace for chirality.\n", "  In this paper free quantum theories are derived solely from their underlying\nsymmetry group without reference to a Lagrangean or classical physics and then\ninteractions are introduced by making use of automorphism of the symmetry\nalgebra. It is shown how the solution of a theory interacting with background\nfields is obtained exactly and purely algebraically from the free theory by the\naction of a linear operator. The method is first applied to the harmonic\noscillator interacting with a conserved current and in a second example to\nstring theory in the presence of constant dilaton, Kalb-Ramond or gravitational\nfields. The derived interaction for the Kalb-Ramond background is periodic and\nthe interactions with a dilaton respectively a gravitational field exhibit a\nstrong-weak-coupling duality. Furthermore, it is proposed in this paper to\ninterpret T-duality as a position-momentum duality on compact space.\n", "  A simulation of the hydrodynamics on the two dimensional non-commutative\nspace is performed, in which the space coordinates $(x, y)$ are\nnon-commutative, satisfying the commutation relation $[x, y]=i \\theta$. The\nNavier-Stokes equation has an extra force term which reflects the\nnon-commutativity of the space, being proportional to $\\theta^2$. This\nparameter $\\theta$ is related to the minimum size of fluid particles which is\nimplied by the uncertainty principle, $\\Delta x \\Delta y \\ge \\theta/2$. To see\nthe effect of this parameter on the flow, following situation is considered. An\nobstacle placed in the middle of the stream, separates the flow into small slit\nand large slit, but the flow is joined afterwards in the down stream. For the\nReynolds number 700, the behavior of the flows with and without $\\theta$ is\nobserved to differ, and the difference is seen to be correlated to the\ndifference of the activity of vortices in the down stream. The oscillation of\nthe flow rate at the small slit diminishes after the certain time in the usual\nflow when the \"two attached eddies\" appear. In the non-commutative flow this\ntwo attached eddies appear from the beginning and the behavior of the flows\ndoes not fluctuate largely. The irregularity in the flow existing in the\nbeginning disappears after the certain time.\n", "  We report on a transient optical reflectivity study of the charge density\nwave (CDW) in CuxTiSe2 single crystals. Our measurements reveal that the system\nundergoes a quantum phase transition at x=0.04 from a strong commensurate CDW\n(x<0.04) to a soft incommensurate CDW (x>0.04). We find that the cooperative\ndriving mechanisms for the commensurate CDW, the excitonic insulator mechanism\nand the soft L$_1$$^-$ phonon mode, decouple at x=0.04 with the observed\nfluctuations in the folded Se-4p band dominating the transition. We also\ndemonstrate a loss of coherence in the A$_{1g}$ phonon with increased copper\nintercalation of the parent lattice, indicating a loss of long-range lattice\norder. These findings provide compelling evidence that TiSe2 undergoes a\nquantum phase transition upon copper intercalation from a state of commensurate\ncharge order to a state with a different symmetry in which the new charge order\ncoexists with the superconducting phase.\n", "  The equations for the amplitudes of transition probabilities are found. The\nresonance frequency of the system is calculated. It is shown the dependence of\nthe resonance frequency on the initial transverse coordinate of an electron.\nThis dependence is analized.\n", "  The stability of CH3NH3PbI3 was investigated by observing the damage on a\nco-evaporated film irradiated by a blue laser in ultrahigh vacuum. X-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were\nemployed to investigate the irradiation effects on the surface. The core levels\nof perovskite were observed to shift toward higher binding energy (BE) during\nthe irradiation, suggesting that surface became more n-type. Metallic Pb\nappeared after 120 minutes of irradiation, indicating that the film has started\nto decompose. The decomposition saturated after about 480 minutes of\nirradiation when the ratio of metallic Pb to total Pb was about 33%.\nFurthermore, the film was no longer continuous after irradiation because of the\nstress change after irradiation, as the substrate Au and oxygen were detected\nby XPS. SEM images also show a roughened surface after irradiation. The results\nstrongly indicate that the perovskite is sensitive to the laser irradiation,\nand the decomposition is a self-limiting process.\n", "  Spatial positioning of nanocrystal building blocks on a solid surface is a\nprerequisite for assembling individual nanoparticles into functional devices.\nHere, we report on the graphoepitaxial liquid-solid growth of nanowires of the\nphotovoltaic compound CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ in open nanofluidic channels. The\nguided growth, visualized in real-time with a simple optical microscope,\nundergoes through a metastable solvatomorph formation in polar aprotic\nsolvents. The presently discovered crystallization leads to the fabrication of\nmm2-sized surfaces composed of perovskite nanowires having controlled sizes,\ncross-sectional shapes, aspect ratios and orientation which have not been\nachieved thus far by other deposition methods. The automation of this general\nstrategy paves the way towards fabrication of wafer-scale perovskite nanowire\nthin films well-suited for various optoelectronic devices, e.g. solar cells,\nlasers, light-emitting diodes and photodetectors.\n", "  In this work we compare Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of electron transport\nproperties with reflection electron energy loss measurements in diamond and\ngraphite films. We assess the impact of different approximations of the\ndielectric response on the observables of interest for the characterization of\ncarbon-based materials. We calculate the frequency-dependent dielectric\nresponse and energy loss function of these materials in two ways: a full ab\ninitio approach, in which we carry out time-dependent density functional\nsimulations in linear response for different momentum transfers, and a\nsemi-classical model, based on the Drude--Lorentz extension to finite momenta\nof the optical dielectric function. Ab initio calculated dielectric functions\nlead to a better agreement with electron energy loss measured spectra with\nrespect the widely used Drude-Lorentz model. This discrepancy is particularly\nevident for insulators and semiconductors beyond the optical limit ($\\mathbf{q}\n\\neq 0$), where single particle excitations become relevant. Furthermore, we\nshow that the behaviour of the energy loss function at different accuracy\nlevels has a dramatic effect on other physical observables, such as the\ninelastic mean free path and the stopping power in the low energy regime ($<\n100$ eV) and thus on the accuracy of MC simulations.\n", "  The influence of deep convection on water vapor in the Tropical Tropopause\nLayer (TTL), the region just below the high ($\\sim$18 km), cold tropical\ntropopause, remains an outstanding question in atmospheric science. Moisture\ntransport to this region is important for climate projections because it drives\nthe formation of local cirrus (ice) clouds, which have a disproportionate\nimpact on the Earth's radiative balance. Deep cumulus towers carrying large\nvolumes of ice are known to reach the TTL, but their importance to the water\nbudget has been debated for several decades. We show here that profiles of the\nisotopic composition of water vapor can provide a quantitative estimate of the\nconvective contribution to TTL moistening. Isotopic measurements from the ACE\nsatellite instrument, in conjunction with ice loads inferred from CALIOP\nsatellite measurements and simple mass-balance modeling, suggest that\nconvection is the dominant source of water vapor in the TTL up to\nnear-tropopause altitudes. The relatively large ice loads inferred from CALIOP\nsatellite measurements can be produced only with significant water sources, and\nisotopic profiles imply that these sources are predominantly convective ice.\nSublimating ice from deep convection appears to increase TTL cirrus by a factor\nof several over that expected if cirrus production were driven only by\nlarge-scale uplift; sensitivity analysis implies that these conclusions are\nrobust for most physically reasonable assumptions. Changes in tropical deep\nconvection in future warmer conditions may thus provide an important climate\nfeedback.\n", "  In this paper, we will consider generalised eigenfunctions of the Laplacian\non some surfaces of infinite area. We will be interested in lower bounds on the\nnumber of nodal domains of such eigenfunctions which are included in a given\nbounded set.\n  We will first of all consider finite sums of plane waves, and give a\ncriterion on the amplitudes and directions of propagation of these plane waves\nwhich guarantees an optimal lower bound, of the same order as Courant's upper\nbound.\n  As an application, we will obtain optimal lower bounds for the number of\nnodal domains of distorted plane waves on some families of surfaces of\nnon-positive curvature.\n", "  We study the distribution of the smallest eigenvalue for certain classes of\npositive-definite Hermitian random matrices, in the limit where the size of the\nmatrices becomes large. Their limit distributions can be expressed as Fredholm\ndeterminants of integral operators associated to kernels built out of Meijer\n$G$-functions or Wright's generalized Bessel functions. They generalize in a\nnatural way the hard edge Bessel kernel Fredholm determinant. We express the\nlogarithmic derivatives of the Fredholm determinants identically in terms of a\n$2\\times 2$ Riemann-Hilbert problem, and use this representation to obtain the\nso-called large gap asymptotics.\n", "  The pentazolates, the last all-nitrogen members of the azole series, have\nbeen notoriously elusive for the last hundred years despite enormous efforts to\nmake these compounds in either gas or condensed phases. Here we report a\nsuccessful synthesis of a solid state compound consisting of isolated\npentazolate anions N5-, which is achieved by compressing and laser heating\ncesium azide (CsN3) mixed with N2 cryogenic liquid in a diamond anvil cell. The\nexperiment was guided by theory, which predicted the transformation of the\nmixture at high pressures to a new compound, cesium pentazolate salt (CsN5).\nElectron transfer from Cs atoms to N5 rings enables both aromaticity in the\npentazolates as well as ionic bonding in the CsN5 crystal. This work provides a\ncritical insight into the role of extreme conditions in exploring unusual\nbonding routes that ultimately lead to the formation of novel high nitrogen\ncontent species.\n", "  We present a de Haas-van Alphen study of the Fermi surface of the low\ntemperature antiferromagnet CeZn11 and its non-magnetic analogue LaZn11,\nmeasured by torque magnetometry up to fields of 33T and at temperatures down to\n320 mK. Both systems possess similar de Haas-van Alphen frequencies, with three\nclear sets of features - ranging from 50T to 4kT - corresponding to three bands\nof a complex Fermi surface, with an expected fourth band also seen weakly in\nCeZn11. The effective masses of the charge carriers are very light (<1 me) in\nLaZn11 but a factor of 2 - 4 larger in CeZn11, indicative of stronger\nelectronic correlations. We perform detailed density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations for CeZn11 and find that only DFT+U calculations with U=1.5 eV,\nwhich localize the 4f states, provide a good match to the measured de Haas-van\nAlphen frequencies, once the presence of magnetic breakdown orbits is also\nconsidered. Our study suggests that the Fermi surface of CeZn11 is very close\nto that of LaZn11 being dominated by Zn 3d, as the Ce 4f states are localised\nand have little influence on its electronic structure, however, they are\nresponsible for its magnetic order and contribute to enhance electronic\ncorrelations.\n", "  Einstein wrote memorably that `The eternally incomprehensible thing about the\nworld is its comprehensibility.' This paper argues that the universe must be\ncomprehensible at some level for information gathering and utilizing subsystems\nsuch as human observers to evolve and function.\n", "  We perform a numerical simulation of the two-dimensional ${\\cal N}=(2,2)$\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory on the discretized curved space. The\n$U(1)_{A}$ anomaly of the continuum theory is maintained also in the\ndiscretized theory as an unbalance of the number of the fermions. In the\nprocess, we propose a new phase-quenched approximation, which we call the\n\"anomaly-phase-quenched (APQ) method\", to make the partition function and\nobservables well-defined by $U(1)_{A}$ phase cancellation. By adopting APQ\nmethod, we estimate the Ward-Takahashi identity for exact SUSY on lattice and\nclarify contribution of the pseudo zero-modes to the pfaffian phase.\n", "  Synthesis and extensive structural, pyroelectric, magnetic, dielectric and\nmagneto-electric characterizations are reported for polycrystalline Co4Nb2O9\ntowards unraveling the multiferroic state especially in reference to the\nmagnetic spin flop transition. Magnetic measurements confirm the Co4Nb2O9\nbecomes antiferromagnetic (AFM) at around 28 K but no clear evidence for\nspin-flop effect was found. Associated with the magnetic phase transition, a\nsharp peak in pyroelectric current indicates the appearance of the strong\nmagneto-electric coupling below Neel temperature (TN) with a large coupling\nconstant upto 17.8 uC/m^2T. Using temperature oscillation technique, we\nestablish Co4Nb2O9 to be a genuine multiferroic with spontaneous electric\npolarization in the anti-ferromagnetic state.\n", "  In proliferating epithelia of mammalian skin, cells of irregular\npolygonal-like shapes pack into complex nearly flat two-dimensional structures\nthat are pliable to deformations. In this work, we employ various sensitive\ncorrelation functions to quantitatively characterize structural features of\nevolving packings of epithelial cells across length scales in mouse skin. We\nfind that the pair statistics in direct and Fourier spaces of the cell\ncentroids in the early stages of embryonic development show structural\ndirectional dependence, while in the late stages the patterns tend towards\nstatistically isotropic states. We construct a minimalist four-component\nstatistical-mechanical model involving effective isotropic pair interactions\nconsisting of hard-core repulsion and extra short-ranged soft-core repulsion\nbeyond the hard core, whose length scale is roughly the same as the hard core.\nThe model parameters are optimized to match the sample pair statistics in both\ndirect and Fourier spaces. By doing this, the parameters are biologically\nconstrained. Our model predicts essentially the same polygonal shape\ndistribution and size disparity of cells found in experiments as measured by\nVoronoi statistics. Moreover, our simulated equilibrium liquid-like\nconfigurations are able to match other nontrivial unconstrained statistics,\nwhich is a testament to the power and novelty of the model. We discuss ways in\nwhich our model might be extended so as to better understand morphogenesis (in\nparticular the emergence of planar cell polarity), wound-healing, and disease\nprogression processes in skin, and how it could be applied to the design of\nsynthetic tissues.\n", "  After the first LHC long shutdown with upgrades to the machine and the\ndetectors, since 2015 the ATLAS experiment recorded more than 30 fb-1 of\nintegrated luminosity of pp collision data at 13 TeV centre- of-mass energy.\nThe data collected to date, the detector and physics performance, and\nmeasurements of Standard Model processes are reviewed briefly before\nsummarising the latest ATLAS results in the Brout- Englert-Higgs sector, where\nsubstantial progress has been made since the discovery. Searches for physics\nphenomena beyond the Standard Model are also summarized. These proceedings\nreflect only a brief summary of the material presented at the conference.\n", "  Neutrino oscillations in a core-collapse supernova may be responsible for the\nobserved rapid motions of pulsars. Three-dimensional numerical calculations\nshow that, in the absence of neutrino oscillations, the recoil velocities of\nneutron stars should not exceed 200 km/s, while there exists a substantial\npopulation of pulsars that move faster than 1000 km/s. A small asymmetry in the\nneutrino emission may be the solution of this long-standing puzzle. Such an\nasymmetry could arise from neutrino oscillations, but, given the present bounds\non the neutrino masses, the pulsar kicks require a sterile neutrino with a 1-20\nkeV mass and a small mixing with active neutrinos. The same particle can be the\ncosmological dark matter. Its existence can be confirmed by X-ray telescopes if\nthey detect X-ray photons from the decays of the relic sterile neutrinos. One\ncan also verify the neutrino kick mechanism by observing gravity waves from a\nnearby supernova.\n", "  A direction sensitive dark matter detector using organic crystals is being\ndeveloped. It exploits the anisotropic scintillation efficiency of organic\ncrystals with respect to the direction of nuclear recoils relative to\ncrystallographic axes. A variation of about 7% was observed in the\nscintillation efficiency of carbon recoils in a stilbene crystal for recoil\nenergies of 30 keV to 1 MeV. We have performed a pilot experiment at Kamioka to\nprove the feasibility of this method.\n", "  Solar neutrino flares astronomy is at the edge of its discover. High energy\nflare particles (protons, alpha) whose self scattering within the solar corona\nis source of a rich prompt charged pions are also source of sharp solar\nneutrino \"burst\" (at tens-hundred MeV) produced by their pion-muon primary\ndecay in flight. This brief (minute) solar neutrino \"burst\" at largest peak\novercome by four-five order of magnitude the steady atmospheric neutrino noise\nat the Earth. Later on, solar flare particles hitting the terrestrial\natmosphere may marginally increase the atmospheric neutrino flux without\nrelevant consequences. Largest prompt \"burst\" solar neutrino flare may be\ndetected in present or better in future largest neutrino underground neutrino\ndetectors. Our estimate for the recent and exceptional October - November 2003\nsolar flares gives a number of events above or just near unity for\nSuper-Kamiokande. The neutrino spectra may reflect in a subtle way the neutrino\nflavour mixing in flight. A surprising tau appearance may even occur for a hard\n({E}_{nu}_{mu}--> {E}_{nu}_{tau} > 4 GeV) flare spectra. A comparison of the\nsolar neutrino flare (at their birth place on Sun and after oscillation on the\narrival on the Earth) with other neutrino foreground is here described and it\noffer an independent road map to disentangle the neutrino flavour puzzles and\nits secret flavour mixing angles .\n", "  A hypercritical value for the magnetic field is determined, which provides\nthe full compensation of the positronium rest mass by the binding energy in the\nmaximum symmetry state and disappearance of the energy gap separating the\nelectron-positron system from the vacuum. The compensation becomes possible\nowing to the falling to the center phenomenon. The structure of the vacuum is\ndescribed in terms of strongly localized states of tightly mutually bound (or\nconfined) pairs. Their delocalization for still higher magnetic field, capable\nof screening its further growth, is discussed.\n", "  Stable neutrino and U quark of 4th generation are excluded neither by\nexperimental data, nor by astrophysical constraints. Moreover, excess of stable\n$\\bar U$ quarks in the Universe can lead to an exciting composite\nnuclear-interacting form of dark matter, which can even dominate in large scale\nstructure formation.\n", "  Many different mechanisms can contribute to antiprotons and positrons\nproduction, ranging from conventional reactions up to exotic processes like\nneutralino annihilation. The open problems are so fundamental (i.e.: is the\nuniverse symmetric in matter and antimatter ?) that experiments in this field\nwill probably be of the greatest interest in the next years. Here we will\nsummarize the present situation, showing the different hypothesis and models\nand the experimental measurements needed to lead to a more established\nscenario.\n", "  The coupling of the electromagnetic field to gravity is an age-old problem.\nPresently, there is a resurgence of interest in it, mainly for two reasons: (i)\nExperimental investigations are under way with ever increasing precision, be it\nin the laboratory or by observing outer space. (ii) One desires to test out\nalternatives to Einstein's gravitational theory, in particular those of a\ngauge-theoretical nature, like Einstein-Cartan theory or metric-affine gravity.\nA clean discussion requires a reflection on the foundations of electrodynamics.\nIf one bases electrodynamics on the conservation laws of electric charge and\nmagnetic flux, one finds Maxwell's equations expressed in terms of the\nexcitation H=(D,H) and the field strength F=(E,B) without any intervention of\nthe metric or the linear connection of spacetime. In other words, there is\nstill no coupling to gravity. Only the constitutive law H= functional(F)\nmediates such a coupling. We discuss the different ways of how metric,\nnonmetricity, torsion, and curvature can come into play here. Along the way, we\ntouch on non-local laws (Mashhoon), non-linear ones (Born-Infeld,\nHeisenberg-Euler, Plebanski), linear ones, including the Abelian axion (Ni),\nand find a method for deriving the metric from linear electrodynamics (Toupin,\nSchoenberg). Finally, we discuss possible non-minimal coupling schemes.\n", "  The range of expected amplitudes and spectral slopes of relic (squeezed)\ngravitational waves, predicted by theory and partially supported by\nobservations, is within the reach of sensitive gravity-wave detectors. In the\nmost favorable case, the detection of relic gravitational waves can be achieved\nby the cross-correlation of outputs of the initial laser interferometers in\nLIGO, VIRGO, GEO600. In the more realistic case, the sensitivity of advanced\nground-based and space-based laser interferometers will be needed. The specific\nstatistical signature of relic gravitational waves, associated with the\nphenomenon of squeezing, is a potential reserve for further improvement of the\nsignal to noise ratio.\n", "  The main general relativistic effects in the motion of the Moon are briefly\nreviewed. The possibility of detection of the solar gravitomagnetic\ncontributions to the mean motions of the lunar node and perigee is discussed.\n", "  We present a second-quantized field theory of massive spin one-half particles\nor antiparticles in the presence of a weak gravitational field treated as a\nspin two external field in a flat Minkowski background. We solve the\ndifficulties which arise from the derivative coupling and we are able to\nintroduce an interaction picture. We derive expressions for the scattering\namplitude and for the outgoing spinor to first-order. In several appendices,\nthe link with the canonical approach in General Relativity is established and a\ngeneralized stationary phase method is used to calculate the outgoing spinor.\nWe show how our expressions can be used to calculate and discuss phase shifts\nin the context of matter-wave interferometry (especially atom or antiatom\ninterferometry). In this way, many effects are introduced in a unified\nrelativistic framework, including spin-gravitation terms: gravitational red\nshift, Thomas precession, Sagnac effect, spin-rotation effect, orbital and spin\nLense-Thirring effects, de Sitter geodetic precession and finally the effect of\ngravitational waves. A new analogy with the electromagnetic interaction is\npointed out.\n", "  The paper gives an introduction to the gravitational radiation theory of\nisolated sources and to the propagation properties of light rays in radiative\ngravitational fields. It presents a theoretical study of the generation,\npropagation, back-reaction, and detection of gravitational waves from\nastrophysical sources. After reviewing the various quadrupole-moment laws for\ngravitational radiation in the Newtonian approximation, we show how to\nincorporate post-Newtonian corrections into the source multipole moments, the\nradiative multipole moments at infinity, and the back-reaction potentials. We\nfurther treat the light propagation in the linearized gravitational field\noutside a gravitational wave emitting source. The effects of time delay,\nbending of light, and moving source frequency shift are presented in terms of\nthe gravitational lens potential. Time delay results are applied in the\ndescription of the procedure of the detection of gravitational waves.\n", "  The dynamical equations which are basic for the description of the dynamics\nof quantum felds in arbitrary space--time geometries, can be derived from the\nrequirements of a unique deterministic evolution of the quantum fields, the\nsuperposition principle, a finite propagation speed, and probability\nconservation. We suggest and describe observations and experiments which are\nable to test the unique deterministic evolution and analyze given experimental\ndata from which restrictions of anomalous terms violating this basic principle\ncan be concluded. One important point is, that such anomalous terms are\npredicted from loop gravity as well as from string theories. Most accurate data\ncan be obtained from future astrophysical observations. Also, laboratory tests\nlike spectroscopy give constraints on the anomalous terms.\n", "  Rapporteur's Introduction to the GT8 session of the Ninth Marcel Grossmann\nMeeting (Rome, 2000); to appear in the Proceedings.\n", "  Modern formulations of equivalence principles provide the foundation for an\nefficient approach to understanding and organizing the structural features of\ngravitation field theories. Since theories' predictions reflect differences in\ntheir structures, principles of equivalence also support an efficient\nexperimental strategy for testing gravitation theories and for exploring the\nrange of conceivable gravitation physics. These principles focus attention\nsquarely on empirical consequences of the fundamental structural differences\nthat distinguish one gravitation theory from another. Interestingly, the\nvariety of such consequences makes it possible to design and perform\nexperiments that test equivalence principles stringently but do so in markedly\ndifferent ways than the most familiar experimental tests.\n", "  The main theoretical aspects of gravitomagnetism are reviewed. It is shown\nthat the gravitomagnetic precession of a gyroscope is intimately connected with\nthe special temporal structure around a rotating mass that is revealed by the\ngravitomagnetic clock effect. This remarkable effect, which involves the\ndifference in the proper periods of a standard clock in prograde and retrograde\ncircular geodesic orbits around a rotating mass, is discussed in detail. The\nimplications of this effect for the notion of ``inertial dragging'' in the\ngeneral theory of relativity are presented. The theory of the clock effect is\ndeveloped within the PPN framework and the possibility of measuring it via\nspaceborne clocks is examined.\n", "  The disappearance of nu_mu was studied using the K2K-I dataset, which was\ntaken before July, 2001. We observed indications of neutrino oscillation. The\nresultant oscillation-parameter region was consistent with the atmospheric\nneutrino result. The appearance of nu_e was searced for in the same dataset. No\nexcess was found over the expected background.\n", "  Searches for lepton flavor violating tau -> l gamma, tau -> lll and tau ->\nlhh decays at the BaBar experiment are presented. Upper limits on the branching\nratios are obtained at the level of 10^{-7} at 90% confidence level.\n", "  We present a review of BaBar results on e+e- annihilations into exclusive\nhadronic final states using the initial state radiation technique. Cross\nsections over the sqrt{s} range from threshold to 4.5 GeV, with very small\npoint-to-point systematic errors, are presented for the 3pi, 2(pi+ pi-), 3(pi+\npi-), 2(pi+ pi-)2pi0, K+ K- pi+ pi-, 2(K+ K-) and p anti-p final states. The\nproton form factor and the ratio of its electric and magnetic components are\nalso presented.\n", "  The OPERA experiment will search for neutrino oscillations using a muon\nneutrino beam and a hybrid emulsion-scintillator detector. Basic principles,\ncurrent status and expected performance of the experiment are discussed.\n", "  It is emphasized that resolution of the $\\theta_{23}$ ambiguity is important\nfor determination of $\\theta_{13}$ if $\\sin^22\\theta_{23}<1$, and resolution of\nthe sgn($\\Delta m^2_{31}$) ambiguity is important for determination of the CP\nphase $\\delta$. I discuss the prospects of resolution of the $\\theta_{23}$\nambiguity etc. in the future long baseline experiment after the JPARC\nexperiment measures the oscillation probabilities $P(\\nu_\\mu\\to\\nu_e)$ and\n$P(\\bar{\\nu}_\\mu\\to\\bar{\\nu}_e)$ at $|\\Delta m^2_{31}|L/4E=\\pi/2$.\n", "  We discuss two extensions of the Standard Model based on the seesaw mechanism\nand on non-abelian family symmetry groups O(2) and $D_4$, respectively. Both\nmodels have a twofold-degenerate neutrino Dirac mass matrix $M_D$, a Majorana\nmass matrix invariant under a $\\mu$--$\\tau$ interchange symmetry and the\npredictions of maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing and vanishing mixing angle\n$\\theta_{13}$. Leptogenesis can naturally be incorporated if $10^{-3} \\lesssim\nm_1 \\lesssim 10^{-2}$ eV where $m_1$ the mass of the lightest neutrino and if\nthe relevant heavy neutrinos are in the range $10^{11}$ to $10^{12}$ GeV. The\n$D_4$ model is more constrained and leptogenesis requires $m_1$ to be in the\nvicinity of $4 \\times 10^{-3}$ eV.\n", "  We stress that specific texture zeros of lepton mass matrices, which might\ndynamically arise from a new kind of flavor symmetry, can help us to establish\nsimple and testable relations between the lepton flavor mixing parameters and\nlepton mass ratios. We present a brief review of one-zero, two-zero and\nthree-zero textures of the neutrino mass matrix. Their phenomenological\nconsequences on neutrino mixing and CP violation are also discussed.\n", "  In this talk we discuss some details of the analysis of neutrino data and our\npresent understanding of neutrino masses and mixing. This talk is based on\nhep-ph/0306001, hep-ph/0306226 and hep-ph/0404085.\n", "  We give predictions for the up-down asymmetry in the Nadir angle dependence\nof the ratio Nmu/Ne of the rates of the mu-like and e-like multi-GeV events\nmeasured in water-Cerenkov detectors (Super-Kamiokande, etc.) in the case of\n3-neutrino oscillations of the atmospheric nu_e (antinu_e) and nu_mu\n(antinu_mu), driven by one neutrino mass squared difference, |Delta m^2_{atm}|\n= |Delta m^2_{31}| ~ (2.0 - 3.0) 10^{-3} eV^2 >> Delta m^2_{21} = Delta\nm^2_{sol}. This ratio is particularly sensitive to the Earth matter effects in\nthe atmospheric neutrino oscillations, and thus to the values of sin^2(theta13)\nand sin^2(theta23), theta13 and theta23 being the neutrino mixing angle limited\nby the CHOOZ and Palo Verde experiments and that responsible for the dominant\natmospheric nu_mu -> nu_tau (antinu_mu -> antinu_tau) oscillations,\nrespectively. It is also sensitive to the type of neutrino mass spectrum which\ncan be with normal (Delta m^2_{atm} > 0) or with inverted (Delta m^2_{atm} < 0)\nhierarchy.\n", "  We present a short discussion on the expected magnitude of $|U_{e3}|$ in the\ncontext of various scenarios proposed to describe neutrino masses and mixing.\nGeneric expectation is relatively large ($>0.05$) values for $\\ue3$ which occur\nin many well-motivated theoretical scenarios and models.\n", "  Exact solutions of Schroedinger and Pauli equations for charged particles in\nan external stationary electromagnetic field of an arbitrary configuration are\nconstructed. Green functions of scalar and spinor particles are calculated in\nthis field. The corresponding equations for complex energy of particles bounded\nby short range potential are deduced. Boundary condition typical for delta -\npotential is not used in the treatment. Explicit analytical expressions are\ngiven for the shift and width of a quasistationary level for different\nconfigurations of the external field. The critical value of electric field in\nwhich the idea of quasistationary level becomes meaningless is calculated. It\nis shown that the common view on the stabilizing role of magnetic field\nconcerns only scalar particles.\n", "  In the present talk we present an investigation of nonabelian SU(N) gauge\ntheories, describing a system of fields with non--dual g and dual \\tilde g\ncharges and revealing the generalized dual symmetry. The Zwanziger type action\nis suggested. The renormalization group equations for pure nonabelian theories,\nin particular for pure SU(3)\\times\\widetilde{SU(3)} gauge theory (as an\nexample) are analysed. We consider not only monopoles, but also dyons. The\nbehaviour of the QCD total beta--function is investigated. It was shown that\nthis beta--function is antisymmetric under the interchange\n\\alpha\\leftrightarrow\\frac 1\\alpha (here \\alpha\\equiv\\alpha_s), and has zero\n(\"fixed point\") at \\alpha = 1. Monopoles, or dyons, are responsible for the\nphase transition. Considering critical points at \\alpha_1\\approx 0.4 and\n\\alpha_2\\approx 2.5, we give an explanation of the freezing of \\alpha_s.\n", "  The time dependence that appears to be hinted by the data from the first 13\nyears of the solar neutrino Gallium experiments is viewed as resulting from a\npartial conversion of active neutrinos to light sterile ones through the\nresonant interaction between the magnetic moment of the neutrino and a varying\nsolar field. A summary of the model and its predictions are presented for the\nforthcoming experiments Borexino and LENS.\n", "  The method of the top quark mass measurement from $M_{b l}$ distribution in\n$t \\to b l \\nu$ decays can be considerably improved if applying the technique\nof moments and proceeding to moments of high degree. At the LHC this allows one\nto reduce the systematic and statistical errors of the top mass by more than a\nfactor of two.\n", "  Meson mass spectra, evaluated in the framework of the relativistic model of\nquasi-independent quarks, are presented. Mass values are obtained with the help\nof numerical calculations based on the Dirac equation and by phenomenological\nmass formulae. The Dirac equation involves the potential, which is sum of the\nvector quasi-Coulombic potential and the scalar linear rising confinement\npotential. The phenomenological mass formulae are applied to excited meson\nstates consisting of u-, d-quarks and antiquarks with isotopical spin I=1. A\ncomparison of the evaluated mass spectra with existing data is performed.\nProblems of identification of some meson states in vector and scalar channels\nare discussed.\n", "  We discuss the spectrum of Higgs bosons in the framework of the exceptional\nsupersymmetric standard model. The presence of a $Z'$ and exotic particles\npredicted by the exceptional SUSY model allows the lightest Higgs particle to\nbe significantly heavier than in the MSSM and NMSSM. When the mass of the\nlightest Higgs boson is larger than $135-140 {GeV}$ the heaviest scalar,\npseudoscalar and charged Higgs states lie beyond the ${TeV}$ range.\n", "  Various facets of the concept of mass are discussed. The masses of elementary\nparticles and the search for higgs. The masses of hadrons. The pedagogical\nvirus of relativistic mass.\n", "  The comparison of definite numerical values of analytically evaluated\nasymptotic expressions for order $\\alpha^4$ and $\\alpha^5$ QED contributions to\nthe muon anomalous magnetic moment with the results of numerical calculations\nare presented. It is stressed that observed agreement can be considered as the\nadditional argument in favour of correctness of the recent direct numerical\ncalculations.\n", "  Explicit expressions for the non-singlet and singlet structure functions g_1\nin the small-x region are obtained. They include the total resummation of the\ndouble- and single- logarithms of x and account for the running QCD coupling\neffects. Both the non-singlet and singlet structure functions are Regge\nbehavied asymptotically, with the intercepts predicted in agreement with\nexperiments. A detailed comparison with the DGLAP evolution equations for\ndifferent values of x and Q^2 is performed. Finally, the role played by\nsingular terms in DGLAP fits is discussed and explicitly shown to mimic the\nresummation of leading logarithms at small x.\n", "  We discuss rare meson decays $K^ + \\to \\pi ^ - \\ell ^ + \\ell '^ + $ and $D^ +\n\\to K^ - \\ell ^ + \\ell '^ +$ ($\\ell, \\ell'=e, \\mu$) in a supersymmetric\nextension of the Standard Model with R-parity violation. Estimates of the\nbranching ratios for these decays are presented.\n", "  We further generalize the powerful method, which we have recently developed\nfor description of the background matter influence on neutrinos, for the case\nof an electron moving in matter. On the basis of the modified Dirac equation\nfor the electron, accounting for the standard model interaction with particles\nof the background, we predict and investigate in some detail a new mechanism of\nthe electromagnetic radiation that is emitted by moving in matter electron due\nto its magnetic moment. We have termed this radiation the ``spin light of\nelectron\" in matter and predicted that this radiation can have consequences\naccessible for experimental observations in astrophysical and cosmological\nsettings.\n", "  The general formalism for the description of neutrino oscillations in\narbitrary rapidly varying external fields is elaborated. We obtain the new\neffective Hamiltonian which determines the evolution of the averaged neutrino\nwave function. The general technique is applied to the neutrino oscillations in\nrapidly varying magnetic fields. We evaluate the transition probabilities of\nthe neutrino spin-flavor oscillations in magnetic fields of the Sun and compare\nthem with the numerical solutions of the Schroedinger equation with the exact\nHamiltonian.\n", "  The appearance of new fundamental forces and extra-dimensional modifications\nto gravity in extensions of the Standard Model has motivated considerable\ninterest in testing Newtonian gravity at short distances (<10^-3 m). Presently\na number of new gravity experiments are searching for non-Newtonian effects in\nthe ranges 10^-4 m -- 10^-3 m. However, as challenging as these experiments\nare, formidable new obstacles await the next generation of experiments which\nwill probe gravity at distances <10^-4 m where Casimir/van der Waals forces\nbecome dominant. Here we will review the motivation for conducting such very\nshort distance gravity experiments, and discuss some of the new problems that\nmay arise in future experiments. Finally, we suggest schematic designs for null\nexperiments which would address some of these problems using the\n``iso-electronic'' and ``finite-size'' effects.\n"]}
