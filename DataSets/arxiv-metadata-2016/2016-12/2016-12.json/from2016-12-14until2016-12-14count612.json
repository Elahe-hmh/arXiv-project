The Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT)\nall-sky survey, for the first time gives us an unbiased sample of AGN for all\nbut the most heavily absorbed sources (log NH > 25). Still, the BAT spectra (14\n- 195 keV) are time-averaged over months of observations and therefore hard to\ncompare with softer spectra from the Swift XRT or other missions. This makes it\ndifficult to distinguish between Compton-thin and Compton-thick models. With\nSuzaku, we have obtained simultaneous hard (> 15 keV) and soft (0.3 - 10 keV)\nX-ray spectra for 5 Compton-thick candidate sources. We report on the spectra\nand a comparison with the BAT and earlier XMM observations. Based on both flux\nvariability and spectral shape, we conclude that these hidden sources are not\nCompton-thick. We also report on a possible correlation between excess variance\nand Swift BAT luminosity from the 16 d binned light curves, which holds true\nfor a sample of both absorbed (4 sources), unabsorbed (8 sources), and Compton\nthick (Circinus) AGN, but is weak in the 64 day binned BAT light curves.\n", "  When a colloidal sessile droplet dries on a substrate, the particles\nsuspended in it usually deposit in a ring-like pattern. This phenomenon is\ncommonly referred to as the \"coffee-ring\" effect. One paradigm for why this\noccurs is as a consequence of the solutes being transported towards the pinned\ncontact line by the flow inside the drop, which is induced by surface\nevaporation. From this perspective, the role of the liquid-gas interface in\nshaping the deposition pattern is somewhat minimized. Here, we propose an\nalternative mechanism for the coffee-ring deposition. It is based on the bulk\nflow within the drop transporting particles to the interface where they are\ncaptured by the receding free surface and subsequently transported along the\ninterface until they are deposited near the contact line. That the interface\ncaptures the solutes as the evaporation proceeds is supported by a Lagrangian\ntracing of particles advected by the flow field within the droplet. We model\nthe interfacial adsorption and transport of particles as a one-dimensional\nadvection-generation process in toroidal coordinates and show that the theory\nreproduces ring-shaped depositions. Using this model, deposition patterns on\nboth hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces are examined in which the evaporation\nis modeled as being either diffusive or uniform over the surface.\n", "  We present a thermodynamic theory of the Kovacs effect based on the idea that\nthe configurational degrees of freedom of a glass-forming material are driven\nout of equilibrium with the heat bath by irreversible thermal contraction and\nexpansion. We assume that the slowly varying configurational subsystem, i.e.\nthe part of the system that is described by inherent structures, is\ncharacterized by an effective temperature, and contains a volume-related\ninternal variable. We examine mechanisms by which irreversible dynamics of the\nfast, kinetic-vibrational degrees of freedom can cause the entropy and the\neffective temperature of the configurational subsystem to increase during\nsufficiently rapid changes in the bath temperature. We then use this theory to\ninterpret the numerical simulations by Mossa and Sciortino (MS), who observe\nthe Kovacs effect in more detail than is feasible in laboratory experiments.\nOur analysis highlights two mechanisms for the equilibration of internal\nvariables. In one of these, an internal variable first relaxes toward a state\nof quasi-equilibrium determined by the effective temperature, and then\napproaches true thermodynamic equilibrium as the effective temperature slowly\nrelaxes toward the bath temperature. In the other mechanism, an internal\nvariable directly equilibrates with the bath temperature on intermediate\ntimescales, without equilibrating with the effective temperature at any stage.\nBoth mechanisms appear to be essential for understanding the MS results.\n", "  A theoretical framework for dislocation dynamics in quasicrystals is provided\naccording to the continuum theory of dislocations. Firstly, we present the\nfundamental theory for moving dislocations in quasicrystals giving the\ndislocation density tensors and introducing the dislocation current tensors for\nthe phonon and phason fields, including the Bianchi identities. Next, we give\nthe equations of motion for the incompatible elastodynamics as well as for the\nincompatible elasto-hydrodynamics of quasicrystals. We continue with the\nderivation of the balance law of pseudomomentum thereby obtaining the\ngeneralized forms of the Eshelby stress tensor, the pseudomomentum vector, the\ndynamical Peach-Koehler force density and the Cherepanov force density for\nquasicrystals. The form of the dynamical Peach-Koehler force for a straight\ndislocation is obtained as well. Moreover, we deduce the balance law of energy\nthat gives rise to the generalized forms of the field intensity vector and the\nelastic power density of quasicrystals. The above balance laws are produced for\nboth models. The differences between the two models and their consequences are\nrevealed. The influences of the phason fields as well as of the dynamical terms\nare also discussed.\n", "  The presence of the light CP-odd scalar boson predicted in the\nnext-to-minimal supersymmetric model (NMSSM) and the simplest little Higgs\nmodel (SLHM) dramatically changes the phenomenology of the Higgs sector. We\nsuggest a practical strategy to discriminate the underlying model of the CP-odd\nscalar boson produced in the decay of the standard model-like Higgs boson. We\ndefine the decay rate of \"the non $b$-tagged jet pair\" with which we compute\nthe ratio of decay rates into lepton and jets. They show much different\nbehaviors between the NMSSM and the SLHM.\n", "  Physical models of intermittency in fully developed turbulence employ many\nphenomenological concepts such as active volume, region, eddy, energy\naccumulation set, etc, used to describe non-uniformity of the energy cascade.\nIn this paper we give those notions a precise mathematical meaning in the\nlanguage of the Littlewood-Paley analysis. We further use our definitions to\nrecover scaling laws for the energy spectrum and second order structure\nfunction with proper intermittency correction.\n", "  We study the properties of the probability density function (PDF) of a\nbistable system driven by heavy tailed white symmetric L\\'evy noise. The shape\nof the stationary PDF is found analytically for the particular case of the\nL\\'evy index \\alpha = 1 (Cauchy noise). For an arbitrary L\\'evy index we employ\nnumerical methods based on the solution of the stochastic Langevin equation and\nspace fractional kinetic equation. In contrast with the bistable system driven\nby Gaussian noise, in the L\\'evy case the positions of maxima of the stationary\nPDF do not coincide with the positions of minima of the bistable potential. We\nprovide a detailed study of the distance between the maxima and the minima as a\nfunction of the potential's depth and L\\'evy noise parameters.\n", "  We investigate the dynamics of a small long-range interacting system, in\ncontact with a large long-range thermal bath. Our analysis reveals the\nexistence of striking anomalies in the energy flux between the bath and the\nsystem. In particular, we find that the evolution of the system is not\ninfluenced by the kinetic temperature of the bath, as opposed to what happens\nfor short-range collisional systems. As a consequence, the system may get\nhotter also when its initial temperature is larger than the bath temperature.\nThis observation is explained quantitatively in the framework of the\ncollisionless Vlasov description of toy models with long-range interactions and\nshown to be valid whenever the Vlasov picture applies, from cosmology to plasma\nphysics.\n", "  Weak value (WV) is a quantum mechanical measurement protocol, proposed by\nAharonov, Albert, and Vaidman. It consists of a weak measurement, which is\nweighed in, conditional on the outcome of a later, strong measurement. Here we\ndefine another two-step measurement protocol, null weak value (NVW), and point\nout its advantages as compared to WV. We present two alternative derivations of\nNWVs and compare them to the corresponding derivations of WVs.\n", "  Radiation pressure on dust grains may be an important physical mechanism\ndriving galaxy-wide superwinds in rapidly star-forming galaxies. We calculate\nthe combined dust and gas Eddington ratio (Gamma) for the archetypal superwind\nof M82. By combining archival GALEX data, a standard dust model, Monte Carlo\ndust scattering calculations, and the Herschel map of the dust surface density\ndistribution, the observed FUV/NUV surface brightness in the outflow constrains\nboth the total UV luminosity escaping from the starburst along its minor axis\n(L_*, UV) and the flux-mean opacity, thus allowing a calculation of Gamma. We\nfind that L_(*, UV) ~ 1-6*10^42 ergs s^-1, ~2-12 times greater than the UV\nluminosity observed from our line of sight. On a scale of 1-3 kpc above the\nplane of M82, we find that Gamma ~ 0.01 - 0.06. On smaller scales (~0.25-0.5\nkpc), where the enclosed mass decreases, our calculation of L_(*, UV) implies\nthat Gamma ~ 0.1 with factor of few uncertainties. Within the starburst itself,\nwe estimate the single-scattering Eddington ratio to be of order unity. Thus,\nalthough radiation pressure is weak compared to gravity on kpc scales above the\nplane of M82, it may yet be important in launching the observed outflow. We\ndiscuss the primary uncertainties in our calculation, the sensitivity of Gamma\nto the dust grain size distribution, and the time evolution of the wind\nfollowing M82's recent starburst episodes.\n", "  The SuperCDMS experiment in the Soudan Underground Laboratory searches for\ndark matter with a 9-kg array of cryogenic germanium detectors. Symmetric\nsensors on opposite sides measure both charge and phonons from each particle\ninteraction, providing excellent discrimination between electron and nuclear\nrecoils, and between surface and interior events. Surface event rejection\ncapabilities were tested with two $^{210}$Pb sources producing $\\sim$130 beta\ndecays/hr. In $\\sim$800 live hours, no events leaked into the 8--115 keV signal\nregion, giving upper limit leakage fraction $1.7 \\times 10^{-5}$ at 90% C.L.,\ncorresponding to $< 0.6$ surface event background in the future 200-kg\nSuperCDMS SNOLAB experiment.\n", "  We show that a distinguishable mobile impurity inside a one-dimensional\nmany-body state at zero temperature generally does not behave like a\nquasiparticle (QP). Instead, both the impurities dynamics as well as the ground\nstate of the bath are fundamentally transformed by a diverging number of\nzero-energy excitations being generated, leading to what we call\ninfrared-dominated (ID) dynamics. Combining analytics and DMRG numerics we\nprovide a general formula for the power law governing ID dynamics at zero\nmomentum, discuss a threshold beyond which quasiparticle dynamics may occur\nagain, and study the competition between the ID and quasiparticle universality\nclasses at larger impurity momenta.\n", "  We study the interplay between repulsive interaction and an almost staggered\non-site potential in one-dimension. Specifically, we address the Harper model\nfor spinless fermions with nearest-neighbor repulsion, close to half-filling.\nUsing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), we find that, in contrast to\nstandard behavior, the system becomes more compressible as the repulsive\ninteraction is increased. By generating a low-energy effective model, we unveil\nthe effect of interactions using mean-field analysis: the density of a narrow\nband around half-filling is anti-correlated with the on-site potential, whereas\nthe density of lower occupied bands follows the potential and strengthens it.\nAs a result, the states around half-filling are squeezed by the background\ndensity, their band becomes flatter, and the compressibility increases.\n", "  In this work we propose the elastodynamic model of wave-telegraph type for\nthe description of dynamics of quasicrystals. Phonons are represented by waves,\nand phasons by waves damped in time and propagating with finite velocity.\nTherefore, the equations of motion for the phonon fields are of wave type and\nfor the phason fields are of telegraph type. The proposed model constitutes a\nunified theory in the sense that already established models in the literature\ncan be recovered as asymptotic cases of it. The equations of motion for the\ndisplacement fields in the theory of incompatible and compatible elastodynamics\nof wave-telegraph type of quasicrystals are derived.\n", "  In this work we investigate the theory of dynamics of dislocations in\nquasicrystals. We consider three models: the elastodynamic model of wave type,\nthe elasto-hydrodynamic model, and the elastodynamic model of wave-telegraph\ntype. Similarities and differences between the three models are pointed out and\ndiscussed. Using the framework of linear incompatible elastodynamic theory, the\nequations of motion of dislocations are deduced for these three models.\nEspecially, the equations of motion for the phonon and phason elastic\ndistortion tensors and elastic velocity vectors are derived, where the source\nfields are given in terms of the phonon and phason dislocation density and\ndislocation current tensors in analogy to the classical theory of\nelastodynamics of dislocations. The equations of motion for the displacement\nfields are also obtained.\n", "  Using _in situ_ transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we have observed\nnanometre scale dislocation loops formed when an ultra-high-purity tungsten\nfoil is irradiated with a very low fluence of self-ions. Analysis of the TEM\nimages has revealed the largest loops to be predominantly of prismatic 1/2<111>\ntype and of vacancy character. The formation of such dislocation loops is\nsurprising since isolated loops are expected to be highly mobile, and should\nescape from the foil. In this work we show that the observed size and number\ndensity of loops can be explained by the fact that the loops are _not_ isolated\n- the loops formed in close proximity in the cascades interact with each other\nand with vacancy clusters, also formed in cascades, through long-range elastic\nfields, which prevent the escape of loops from the foil. We find that\nexperimental observations are well reproduced by object Kinetic Monte Carlo\nsimulations of evolution of cascades _only_ if elastic interaction between the\nloops is taken into account. Our analysis highlights the profound effect of\nelastic interaction between defects on the microstructural evolution of\nirradiated materials.\n", "  We discuss a few simple modifications to time-dependent density matrix\nrenormalization group (DMRG) algorithms which allow to access larger time\nscales. We specifically aim at beginners and present practical aspects of how\nto implement these modifications almost effortlessly within any standard matrix\nproduct state (MPS) based formulation of the method. Most importantly, we show\nhow to 'combine' the Schroedinger and Heisenberg time evolutions of arbitrary\npure states |psi> and operators A in the evaluation of\n<A>_psi(t)=<psi|A(t)|psi>. This includes quantum quenches. The generalization\n(non-)thermal mixed state dynamics <A>_rho(t)=Tr[rho A(t)] induced by an\ninitial density matrix rho is straightforward. In the context of equilibrium\n(ground state or finite temperature T>0) correlation functions, one can extend\nthe simulation time by a factor of two by 'exploiting time translation\ninvariance', which is efficiently implementable within MPS DMRG. We present a\nsimple analytic argument for why a recently-introduced disentangler succeeds in\nreducing the effort of time-dependent simulations at T>0. Finally, we advocate\nthe python programming language as an elegant option for beginners to set up a\nDMRG code.\n", "  The recent synthesis and characterization of bilayers of vitreous silica has\nproduced valuable new information on ring sizes and distributions. In this\npaper, we compare the ring statistics of experimental samples with computer\ngenerated samples. The average ring size is fixed at six by topology, but the\nwidth, skewness and other moments of the distribution of ring edges are\ncharacteristics of particular samples. We examine the Aboav-Weaire law that\nquantifies the propensity of smaller rings to be adjacent to larger rings, and\nfind similar results for available experimental samples which however differ\nsomewhat from computer-generated bilayers currently. We introduce a new law for\nthe areas of rings of various sizes.\n", "  We study the phenomenology of heavy gauge bosons at the LHC in a nonuniversal\ngauge interaction model with the separate electroweak SU(2) gauge group for the\nthird generation. Considered are the Drell-Yan processes into the final states\nof dilepton, dijet, $\\tau^- \\tau^+$, and $t \\bar{t}$ for $Z'$ boson and those\nof lepton-neutrino for $W'$ boson. We find that the present LHC data provides\nlower bounds on the masses of the heavy gauge bosons, $m_{Z'},~m_{W'} > 2$ TeV,\nmore stringent than indirect bounds, when $\\sin^2 \\phi > 0.15$ for the mixing\nangle of two SU(2) gauge groups.We also note that the study of heavy resonances\ninto the third generation fermions may provide some valuable information in the\nfuture.\n", "  In conventional general relativity without torsion, high-frequency\ngravitational waves couple to the chiral number density of spin one-half\nquanta: the polarization of the waves is rotated by $2\\pi N_5 {\\ell_{\\rm\nPl}^2}$, where $N_5$ is the chiral column density and $\\ell_{\\rm Pl}$ is the\nPlanck length. This means that if a primordial distribution of gravitational\nwaves with E-E or B-B correlations passed through a chiral density of fermions\nin the very early Universe, an E-B correlation will be generated. This in turn\nwill give rise to E-B and T-B correlations in the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB). Less obviously but more primitively, the condition Albrecht called\n\"cosmic coherence\" would be violated, changing the restrictions on the class of\nadmissible cosmological gravitational waves. This altered class of waves would,\ngenerally speaking, probe earlier physics than do the conventional waves; their\neffects on the CMB would be most pronounced for low ($\\lesssim 100$)\nmultipoles. Rough estimates indicate that if the tensor-to-scalar ratio is less\nthan about $10^{-2}$, it will be hard to constrain a spatially homogeneous\nprimordial $N_5$ by present data.\n", "  We compute nucleon and Delta elastic and transition form factors, and compare\npredictions made using a framework built upon a Faddeev equation kernel and\ninteraction vertices that possess QCD-like momentum dependence with results\nobtained using a vector-vector contact-interaction. The comparison emphasises\nthat experiment is sensitive to the momentum dependence of the running\ncouplings and masses in the strong interaction sector of the Standard Model and\nhighlights that the key to describing hadron properties is a veracious\nexpression of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the bound-state problem.\nAmongst the results we describe, the following are of particular interest:\n$G_E^p(Q^2)/G_M^p(Q^2)$ possesses a zero at $Q^2=9.5GeV^2$; any change in the\ninteraction which shifts a zero in the proton ratio to larger $Q^2$ relocates a\nzero in $G_E^n(Q^2)/G_M^n(Q^2)$ to smaller $Q^2$; and there is likely a value\nof momentum transfer above which $G_E^n>G_E^p$. Regarding the\n$\\Delta(1232)$-baryon, we find that, inter alia: the electric monopole form\nfactor exhibits a zero; the electric quadrupole form factor is negative, large\nin magnitude, and sensitive to the nature and strength of correlations in the\n$\\Delta(1232)$ Faddeev amplitude; and the magnetic octupole form factor is\nnegative so long as rest-frame P- and D-wave correlations are included. In\nconnection with the N-to-Delta transition, the momentum-dependence of the\nmagnetic transition form factor, $G_M^\\ast$, matches that of $G_M^n$ once the\nmomentum transfer is high enough to pierce the meson-cloud; and the electric\nquadrupole ratio is a keen measure of diquark and orbital angular momentum\ncorrelations.\n", "  We consider a test of the Copernican Principle through observations of the\nlarge-scale structures, and for this purpose we study the self-gravitating\nsystem in a relativistic huge void universe model which does not invoke the\nCopernican Principle. If we focus on the the weakly self-gravitating and slowly\nevolving system whose spatial extent is much smaller than the scale of the\ncosmological horizon in the homogeneous and isotropic background universe\nmodel, the cosmological Newtonian approximation is available. Also in the huge\nvoid universe model, the same kind of approximation as the cosmological\nNewtonian approximation is available for the analysis of the perturbations\ncontained in a region whose spatial size is much smaller than the scale of the\nhuge void: the effects of the huge void are taken into account in a\nperturbative manner by using the Fermi-normal coordinates. By using this\napproximation, we derive the equations of motion for the weakly\nself-gravitating perturbations whose elements have relative velocities much\nsmaller than the speed of light, and show the derived equations can be\nsignificantly different from those in the homogeneous and isotropic universe\nmodel, due to the anisotropic volume expansion in the huge void. We linearize\nthe derived equations of motion and solve them. The solutions show that the\nbehaviors of linear density perturbations are very different from those in the\nhomogeneous and isotropic universe model.\n", "  The present work provides fundamental quantities in generalized elasticity\nand dislocation theory of quasicrystals. In a clear and straightforward manner,\nthe three-dimensional Green tensor of generalized elasticity theory and the\nextended displacement vector for an arbitrary extended force are derived. Next,\nin the framework of dislocation theory of quasicrystals, the solutions of the\nfield equations for the extended displacement vector and the extended elastic\ndistortion tensor are given; that is the generalized Burgers equation for\narbitrary sources and the generalized Mura-Willis formula, respectively.\nMoreover, important quantities of the theory of dislocations as the Eshelby\nstress tensor, Peach-Koehler force, stress function tensor and the interaction\nenergy are derived for general dislocations. The application to dislocation\nloops gives rise to the generalized Burgers equation, where the displacement\nvector can be written as a sum of a line integral plus a purely geometric part.\nFinally, using the Green tensor, all other dislocation key-formulas for loops,\nknown from the theory of anisotropic elasticity, like the Peach-Koehler stress\nformula, Mura-Willis equation, Volterra equation, stress function tensor and\nthe interaction energy are derived for quasicrystals.\n", "  It is typically assumed that disorder is essential to realize Anderson\nlocalization. Recently, a number of proposals have suggested that an\ninteracting, translation invariant system can also exhibit localization. We\nexamine these claims in the context of a one-dimensional spin ladder. At\nintermediate time scales, we find slow growth of entanglement entropy\nconsistent with the phenomenology of many-body localization. However, at longer\ntimes, all finite wavelength spin polarizations decay in a finite time,\nindependent of system size. We identify a single length scale which\nparametrically controls both the eventual spin transport times and the\ndivergence of the susceptibility to spin glass ordering. We dub this long\npre-thermal dynamical behavior, intermediate between full localization and\ndiffusion, quasi-many body localization.\n", "  We derive a microscopic model for dissipative dynamics in a system of\nmutually interacting qubits coupled to a thermal bath that generalises the\ndissipative model of Landau-Lifschitz-Gilbert to the case of anisotropic bath\ncouplings. We show that the dissipation acts to bias the quantum trajectories\ntowards a reduced phase space. This model applies to a system of\nsuperconducting flux qubits whose coupling to the environment is necessarily\nanisotropic. We study the model in the context of the D-Wave computing device\nand show that the form of environmental coupling in this case produces dynamics\nthat are closely related to several models proposed on phenomenological\ngrounds.\n", "  Quantum engineering requires controllable artificial systems with quantum\ncoherence exceeding the device size and operation time. This can be achieved\nwith geometrically confined low-dimensional electronic structures embedded\nwithin ultraclean materials, with prominent examples being artificial atoms\n(quantum dots) and quantum corrals (electronic cavities). Combining the two\nstructures, we implement a mesoscopic coupled dot-cavity system in a\nhigh-mobility two-dimensional electron gas, and obtain an extended spin-singlet\nstate in the regime of strong dot-cavity coupling. Engineering such extended\nquantum states presents a viable route for nonlocal spin coupling that is\napplicable for quantum information processing.\n", "  We formulate a new error-disturbance relation, which is free from explicit\ndependence upon variances in observables. This error-disturbance relation shows\nimprovement over the one provided by the Branciard inequality and the Ozawa\ninequality for some initial states and for particular class of joint\nmeasurements under consideration. We also prove a modified form of Ozawa's\nerror-disturbance relation. The later relation provides a tighter bound\ncompared to the Ozawa and the Branciard inequalities for a small number of\nstates.\n", "  Classical radiation reaction is the effect of the electromagnetic field\nemitted by an accelerated electric charge on the motion of the charge itself.\nThe self-consistent underlying classical equation of motion including\nradiation-reaction effects, the Landau-Lifshitz equation, has never been tested\nexperimentally, in spite of the first theoretical treatments of radiation\nreaction having been developed more than a century ago. Here we show that\nclassical radiation reaction effects, in particular those due to the near\nelectromagnetic field, as predicted by the Landau-Lifshitz equation, can be\nmeasured in principle using presently available facilities, in the energy\nemission spectrum of $30\\text{-}\\text{GeV}$ electrons crossing a\n$0.55$-$\\text{mm}$ thick diamond crystal in the axial channeling regime. Our\ntheoretical results indicate the feasibility of the suggested setup, e.g., at\nthe CERN Secondary Beam Areas (SBA) beamlines.\n", "  Time delays of electrons emitted from an isotropic initial state and leaving\nbehind an isotropic ion are assumed to be angle-independent. Using an\ninterferometric method involving XUV attosecond pulse trains and an IR probe\nfield in combination with a detection scheme, which allows for full 3D momentum\nresolution, we show that measured time delays between electrons liberated from\nthe $1s^2$ spherically symmetric ground state of helium depend on the emission\ndirection of the electrons relative to the linear polarization axis of the\nionizing XUV light. Such time-delay anisotropy, for which we measure values as\nlarge as 60 attoseconds, is caused by the interplay between final quantum\nstates with different symmetry and arises naturally whenever the\nphotoionization process involves the exchange of more than one photon in the\nfield of the parent-ion. With the support of accurate theoretical models, the\nangular dependence of the time delay is attributed to small phase differences\nthat are induced in the laser-driven continuum transitions to the final states.\nSince most measurement techniques tracing attosecond electron dynamics involve\nthe exchange of at least two photons, this is a general, significant, and\ninitially unexpected effect that must be taken into account in all such\nphotoionization measurements.\n", "  In order to cope with the fact that there exists no single maximally\nentangled state (up to local unitaries) in the multipartite setting, we\nintroduced in [J. I. de Vicente, C. Spee and B. Kraus, Phys. Rev. Lett. 111,\n110502 (2013)] the maximally entangled set of n-partite quantum states. This\nset consists of the states that are most useful under conversion of pure states\nvia Local Operations assisted by Classical Communication (LOCC). We will review\nour results here on the maximally entangled set of three- and generic\nfour-qubit states. Moreover, we will discuss the preparation of arbitrary (pure\nor mixed) states via deterministic LOCC transformations. In particular, we will\nconsider the deterministic preparation of arbitrary three-qubit (four-qubit)\nstates via LOCC using as a resource a six-qubit (23-qubit) state respectively.\n", "  The formation of the Earth's core is a consequence of planetary accretion and\nprocesses in the Earth's interior. The mechanical process of planetary\ndifferentiation is likely to occur in large, if not global, magma oceans\ncreated by the collisions of planetary embryos. Metal-silicate segregation in\nmagma oceans occurs rapidly and efficiently unlike grain scale percolation\naccording to laboratory experiments and calculations. Geochemical models of the\ncore formation process as planetary accretion proceeds are becoming\nincreasingly realistic. Single stage and continuous core formation models have\nevolved into multi-stage models that are couple to the output of dynamical\nmodels of the giant impact phase of planet formation. The models that are most\nsuccessful in matching the chemical composition of the Earth's mantle, based on\nexperimentally-derived element partition coefficients, show that the\ntemperature and pressure of metal-silicate equilibration must increase as a\nfunction of time and mass accreted and so must the oxygen fugacity of the\nequilibrating material. The latter can occur if silicon partitions into the\ncore and through the late delivery of oxidized material. Coupled dynamical\naccretion and multi-stage core formation models predict the evolving mantle and\ncore compositions of all the terrestrial planets simultaneously and also place\nstrong constraints on the bulk compositions and oxidation states of primitive\nbodies in the protoplanetary disk.\n", "  The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation provides a remarkable window\nonto the early universe, revealing its composition and structure. In these\nlectures we review and discuss the physics underlying the main features of the\nCMB.\n", "  We introduce the concepts of cohering and de-cohering power of quantum\nchannels. Using the axiomatic definition of coherence measure, we show that the\noptimizations required for calculations of these measures can be restricted to\npure input states and hence greatly simplified. We then use two examples of\nthis measure, one based on the skew information and the other based on $l-1$\nnorm, we find the cohering and de-cohering measures of a number of one, two and\nn-qubit channels. Contrary to a view at first sight, it is seen that quantum\nchannels can have cohering power. It is also shown that a specific property of\na qubit unitary map, is that it has equal cohering and de-cohering power in any\nbasis. Finally we derive simple relations between cohering and de-cohering\npowers of unitary qubit gates and their tensor products, results which have\nphysically interesting implications.\n", "  We theoretically investigate phosphorene zigzag nanorribons as a platform for\nconstriction engineering. In the presence of a constriction at the upper edge,\nquantum confinement of edge protected states reveals resonant tunnelling\nBreit-Wigner transmission peaks, if the upper edge is uncoupled to the lower\nedge. Coupling between edges in thin constrictions gives rise to Fano-like and\nanti-resonances in the transmission spectrum of the system.\n", "  Effects of velocity dispersion of dark matter particles on the CMB TT power\nspectrum and on the matter linear power spectrum are investigated using a\nmodified CAMB code. Cold dark matter originated from thermal equilibrium\nprocesses does not produce appreciable effects but this is not the case if\nparticles have a non-thermal origin. A cut-off in the matter power spectrum at\nsmall scales, similar to that produced by warm dark matter or that produced in\nthe late forming dark matter scenario, appears as a consequence of velocity\ndispersion effects, which act as a pressure perturbation.\n", "  More than 30 years ago, Thouless introduced the concept of a topological\ncharge pump that would enable the robust transport of charge through an\nadiabatic cyclic evolution of the underlying Hamiltonian. In contrast to\nclassical transport, the transported charge was shown to be quantized and\npurely determined by the topology of the pump cycle, making it robust to\nperturbations. On a fundamental level, the quantized charge transport can be\nconnected to a topological invariant, the Chern number, first introduced in the\ncontext of the integer quantum Hall effect. A Thouless quantum pump may\ntherefore be regarded as a 'dynamical' version of the integer quantum Hall\neffect. Here, we report on the realization of such a topological charge pump\nusing ultracold bosonic atoms that form a Mott insulator in a dynamically\ncontrolled optical superlattice potential. By taking in-situ images of the atom\ncloud, we observe a quantized deflection per pump cycle. We reveal the genuine\nquantum nature of the pump by showing that, in contrast to ground state\nparticles, a counterintuitive reversed deflection occurs when particles are\nprepared in the first excited band. Furthermore, we were able to directly\ndemonstrate that the system undergoes a controlled topological phase transition\nin higher bands when tuning the superlattice parameters.\n", "  We present a modelling approach for diffusion in a complex medium\ncharacterized by a random length scale. The resulting stochastic process shows\nsubdiffusion with a behavior in qualitative agreement with single particle\ntracking experiments in living cells, such as ergodicity breaking, p-variation\nand aging. In particular, this approach recapitulates characteristic features\npreviously described in part by the fractional Brownian motion and in part by\nthe continuous-time random walk. Moreover, for a proper distribution of the\nlength scale, a single parameter controls the ergodic-to-nonergodic transition\nand, remarkably, also drives the transition of the diffusion equation of the\nprocess from non-fractional to fractional, thus demonstrating that fractional\nkinetics emerges from ergodicity breaking.\n", "  We develop a new hadronic model for GEANT4 that is specialized for the\ndisintegration of the deuteron by photons, $d\\gamma \\to n p$. For the\ndescription of two-nucleon interactions, we employ a pionless effective field\ntheory with dibaryon fields (dEFT). We apply the new model of GEANT4 (G4dEFT)\nto the calculations of the total and the differential cross sections in\n$d\\gamma \\to n p$ and compare the results with empirical data. As an\napplication of the new model, we calculate the neutron yield from the $\\gamma +\n{\\rm CD}_2$ process. G4dEFT predicts peaks for the neutron yield, but the\nexisting model of GEANT4 does not show such behavior.\n", "  The Planck mission, thanks to its large frequency range and all-sky coverage,\nhas a unique potential for systematically detecting the brightest, and rarest,\nsubmillimetre sources on the sky, including distant objects in the\nhigh-redshift Universe traced by their dust emission. A novel method, based on\na component-separation procedure using a combination of Planck and IRAS data,\nhas been applied to select the most luminous cold submm sources with spectral\nenergy distributions peaking between 353 and 857GHz at 5' resolution. A total\nof 2151 Planck high-z source candidates (the PHZ) have been detected in the\ncleanest 26% of the sky, with flux density at 545GHz above 500mJy. Embedded in\nthe cosmic infrared background close to the confusion limit, these high-z\ncandidates exhibit colder colours than their surroundings, consistent with\nredshifts z>2, assuming a dust temperature of 35K and a spectral index of 1.5.\nFirst follow-up observations obtained from optical to submm have confirmed that\nthis list consists of two distinct populations. A small fraction (around 3%) of\nthe sources have been identified as strongly gravitationally lensed\nstar-forming galaxies, which are amongst the brightest submm lensed objects\n(with flux density at 545GHz ranging from 350mJy up to 1Jy) at redshift 2 to 4.\nHowever, the vast majority of the PHZ sources appear as overdensities of dusty\nstar-forming galaxies, having colours consistent with z>2, and may be\nconsidered as proto-cluster candidates. The PHZ provides an original sample,\ncomplementary to the Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich Catalogue; by extending the\npopulation of the virialized massive galaxy clusters to a population of sources\nat z>1.5, the PHZ may contain the progenitors of today's clusters. Hence the\nPHZ opens a new window on the study of the early ages of structure formation,\nand the understanding of the intensively star-forming phase at high-z.\n", "  The High Efficiency and Resolution Multi Element Spectrograph, HERMES, is a\nfacility-class optical spectrograph for the Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT).\nIt is designed primarily for Galactic Archaeology, the first major attempt to\ncreate a detailed understanding of galaxy formation and evolution by studying\nthe history of our own galaxy, the Milky Way. The goal of the GALAH survey is\nto reconstruct the mass assembly history of the Milky Way through a detailed\nchemical abundance study of one million stars. The spectrograph is based at the\nAAT and is fed by the existing 2dF robotic fiber positioning system. The\nspectrograph uses volume phase holographic gratings to achieve a spectral\nresolving power of 28,000 in standard mode and also provides a high-resolution\nmode ranging between 40,000 and 50,000 using a slit mask. The GALAH survey\nrequires an SNR greater than 100 for a star brightness of V ?= 14 in an\nexposure time of one hour. The total spectral coverage of the four channels is\nabout 100 nm between 370 and 1000 nm for up to 392 simultaneous targets within\nthe 2-degree field of view. HERMES has been commissioned over three runs,\nduring bright time in October, November, and December 2013, in parallel with\nthe beginning of the GALAH pilot survey, which started in November 2013. We\npresent the first-light results from the commissioning run and the beginning of\nthe GALAH survey, including performance results such as throughput and\nresolution, as well as instrument reliability.\n", "  Well before the atomistic nature of matter was experimentally established,\nLudwig Boltzmann's audacious effort to explain the macroscopic world of human\nexperience in terms of the workings of an unseen microscopic world met with\nvigorous opposition. A contentious point was the problem of irreversibility:\nthe microscopic equations of motion are reversible, yet friction and viscosity\ncause things always to slow down and warm up, never to speed up and cool down.\nWhat was worse, Boltzmann himself discovered that his transport equation\npredicts special cases in which gases never come to thermal equilibrium, a\nparticular example being that the monopole \"breathe\" mode of gas will never\ndamp if it is confined in 3D to a perfectly isotropic harmonic potential. Such\nabsences of damping were not observed in nature. Nondamping of a monopole mode\nin lower dimensional systems has only very recently been observed, using cold\natoms. Kinoshita et al. and Chevy et al. have experimentally observed\nsuppressed relaxation in highly elongated geometries. The difficulty in\ngenerating sufficiently spherical harmonic confinement for ultracold atoms,\nhowever, has meant that Boltzmann's fully 3D, isotropic case has never been\nobserved. With the development of a new magnetic trap capable of producing\nnear-spherical harmonic confinement for ultracold atoms, we have been able to\nmake the first observation of this historically significant oddity. We observe\na monopole mode for which the collisional contribution to damping vanishes, a\nlong-delayed vindication for Boltzmann's microscopic theory.\n", "  A new theory-independent noncontextuality inequality is presented [Phys. Rev.\nLett. 115, 110403 (2015)] based on Kochen-Specker (KS) set without imposing the\nassumption of determinism. By proposing novel noncontextuality inequalities, we\nshow that such result can be generalized from KS set to the noncontextuality\ninequalities not only for state-independent but also for state-dependent\nscenario. The YO-13 ray and $n$ cycle ray are considered as examples.\n", "  Motivated by natural inflation, we propose a relaxation mechanism consistent\nwith inflationary cosmology that explains the hierarchy between the electroweak\nscale and Planck scale. This scenario is based on a selection mechanism that\nidentifies the low scale dynamics as the one that is screened from UV physics.\nThe scenario also predicts the near-criticality and metastability of the\nstandard model vacuum state, explaining the Higgs boson mass observed at the\nLHC. Once Majorana right-handed neutrinos are introduced to provide a viable\nreheating channel, our framework yields a corresponding mass scale that allows\nfor the seesaw mechanism as well as for standard thermal leptogenesis. We argue\nthat considering singlet scalar dark matter extensions of the proposed scenario\ncould solve the vacuum stability problem and discuss how the cosmological\nconstant problem is possibly addressed.\n", "  Isometric fluctuation relations are deduced for the fluctuations of the order\nparameter in equilibrium systems of condensed-matter physics with broken\ndiscrete or continuous symmetries. These relations are similar to their\nanalogues obtained for non-equilibrium systems where the broken symmetry is\ntime reversal. At equilibrium, these relations show that the ratio of the\nprobabilities of opposite fluctuations goes exponentially with the\nsymmetry-breaking external field and the magnitude of the fluctuations. These\nrelations are applied to the Curie-Weiss, Heisenberg, and $XY$~models of\nmagnetism where the continuous rotational symmetry is broken, as well as to the\n$q$-state Potts model and the $p$-state clock model where discrete symmetries\nare broken. Broken symmetries are also considered in the anisotropic\nCurie-Weiss model. For infinite systems, the results are calculated using\nlarge-deviation theory. The relations are also applied to mean-field models of\nnematic liquid crystals where the order parameter is tensorial. Moreover, their\nextension to quantum systems is also deduced.\n", "  We review the latest findings on extra-solar planets and their potential to\nsupport Earth-like life. Focusing on planets orbiting Red Dwarf (RD) stars, the\nmost abundant stellar type, we show that including RDs as potential host stars\ncould increase the probability of finding biotic planets by a factor of up to a\nthousand, and reduce the estimate of the distance to our nearest biotic\nneighbor by up to 10. We argue that binary and multiple star systems need to be\ntaken into account when discussing exoplanet habitability. Early considerations\nindicated that conditions on RD planets would be inimical to life, as their\nHabitable Zones (where liquid water could exist) would be so close as to make\nplanets tidally locked to their star. This was thought to cause an erratic\nclimate and expose life forms to flares of ionizing radiation. Recent\ncalculations show that these negative factors are less severe than originally\nthought. It has been argued that the lesser photon energy of the radiation of\nthe relatively cool RDs would not suffice for Oxygenic Photosynthesis (OP) and\nother related energy expending reactions. Numerous authors suggest that OP on\nRD planets may evolve to utilize photons in the infrared. We however argue, by\nanalogy to the evolution of OP and the environmental physiology and\ndistribution of land-based vegetation on Earth, that the evolutionary pressure\nto utilize infrared radiation would be small. This is because vegetation on RD\nplanets could enjoy continuous illumination of moderate intensity, containing a\nsignificant component of photosynthetic 400-700 nm radiation. We conclude that\nconditions for OP could exist on RD planets and consequently the evolution of\ncomplex life might be possible. Furthermore, the huge number and the long\nlifetime of RDs make it more likely to find planets with photosynthesis and\nlife around RDs than around solar type stars.\n", "  The continuum limit of a 4-dimensional, discrete d'Alembertian operator for\nscalar fields on causal sets is studied. The continuum limit of the mean of\nthis operator in the Poisson point process in 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime\nis shown to be the usual continuum scalar d'Alembertian $\\Box$. It is shown\nthat the mean is close to the limit when there exists a frame in which the\nscalar field is slowly varying on a scale set by the density of the Poisson\nprocess. The continuum limit of the mean of the causal set d'Alembertian in\n4-dimensional curved spacetime is shown to equal $\\Box - \\frac{1}{2}R$, where\n$R$ is the Ricci scalar, under certain conditions on the spacetime and the\nscalar field.\n", "  We investigate plane symmetric space-time filled with perfect fluid in the\n$C$-field cosmology of Hoyle and Narlikar. A new class of exact solutions have\nbeen obtained by considering the creation field $C$ as a function of time only.\nTo get the deterministic solution, it has been assumed that the rate of\ncreation of matter-energy density is proportional to the strength of the\nexisting $C$-field energy density. Several physical aspects and geometrical\nproperties of the models are discussed in detail, especially it is shown that\nsome of our solutions of $C$-field cosmology are free from singularity in\ncontrast to the Big Bang cosmology. A comparative study has been carried out\nbetween two models, one singular and the other nonsingular, by contrasting the\nbehaviour of the physical parameters and noted that the model in a unique way\nrepresents both the features of the accelerating as well as decelerating\nUniverse depending on the parameters and thus seems provides glimpses of the\noscillating or cyclic model of the Universe without invoking any other agent or\ntheory in allowing cyclicity.\n", "  Inspired by the scenario by Bennett et al., a teleportation protocol of\nqubits formed in a two-dimensional electron gas formed at the interface of a\nGaAs heterostructure is presented. The teleportation is carried out using three\nGaAs quantum dots (say $\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{P}'$, $\\mathcal{Q}\\mathcal{Q}'$,\n$\\mathcal{R}\\mathcal{R}'$) and three electrons. The electron spin on GaAs\nquantum dots $\\mathcal{P}\\mathcal{P}'$ is used to encode the unknown qubit. The\nGaAs quantum dot $\\mathcal{Q}\\mathcal{Q}'$ and $\\mathcal{R}\\mathcal{R}'$\ncombine to form {an} entangled state. Alice (the sender) performs a Bell\nmeasurement on pairs ($\\mathcal{P},\\mathcal{Q}$) and\n($\\mathcal{P}',\\mathcal{Q}'$). Depending on the outcome of {the} measurement, a\nsuitable Hamiltonian for the quantum gate can be used by Bob (receiver) to\ntransform the information based on {a} spin to charge-based information. This\nwork offers relevant corrections to misconception in {\\it Chem. Phys. Lett.\n{\\bf421} (2006) 338.\n", "  Characterization of the morphology of strongly lensed galaxies is challenging\nbecause images of such galaxies are typically highly distorted. Lens modeling\nand source plane reconstruction is one approach that can provide reasonably\nundistorted images from which morphological measurements can be made, although\nat the expense of a highly spatially variable telescope PSF when mapped back to\nthe source plane. Unfortunately, modeling the lensing mass is a time and\nresource intensive process, and in many cases there are too few constraints to\nprecisely model the lensing mass. If, however, useful morphological\nmeasurements could be made in the image plane rather than the source plane, it\nwould bypass this issue and obviate the need for a source reconstruction\nprocess for some applications. We examine the use of the Gini coefficient as\none such measurement. Because it depends on the cumulative distribution of the\nlight of a galaxy, but not the relative spatial positions, the fact that\nsurface brightness is conserved by lensing means that the Gini coefficient may\nbe well-preserved by strong gravitational lensing. Through simulations, we test\nthe extent to which the Gini coefficient is conserved, including by effects due\nto PSF convolution and pixelization, to determine whether it is invariant\nenough under lensing to be used as a measurement of galaxy morphology that can\nbe made in the image plane.\n", "  We study a class of periodically driven $d-$dimensional integrable models and\nshow that after $n$ drive cycles with frequency $\\omega$, pure states with\nnon-area-law entanglement entropy $S_n(l) \\sim l^{\\alpha(n,\\omega)}$ are\ngenerated, where $l$ is the linear dimension of the subsystem, and $d-1 \\le\n\\alpha(n,\\omega) \\le d$. We identify and analyze the crossover phenomenon from\nan area ($S \\sim l^{ d-1}$ for $d\\geq1$) to a volume ($S \\sim l^{d}$) law and\nprovide a criterion for their occurrence which constitutes a generalization of\nHastings' theorem to driven integrable systems in one dimension. We also find\nthat $S_n$ generically decays to $S_{\\infty}$ as $(\\omega/n)^{(d+2)/2}$ for\nfast and $(\\omega/n)^{d/2}$ for slow periodic drives; these two dynamical\nphases are separated by a topological transition in the eigensprectrum of the\nFloquet Hamiltonian. This dynamical transition manifests itself in the temporal\nbehavior of all local correlation functions and does not require a critical\npoint crossing during the drive. We find that these dynamical phases show a\nrich re-entrant behavior as a function of $\\omega$ for $d=1$ models, and also\ndiscuss the dynamical transition for $d>1$ models. Finally, we study\nentanglement properties of the steady state and show that singular features\n(cusps and kinks in $d=1$) appear in $S_{\\infty}$ as a function of $\\omega$\nwhenever there is a crossing of the Floquet bands. We discuss experiments which\ncan test our theory.\n", "  The Virgo cluster is the largest Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) source in the sky,\nboth in terms of angular size and total integrated flux. Planck's wide angular\nscale and frequency coverage, together with its high sensitivity, allow a\ndetailed study of this large object through the SZ effect. Virgo is well\nresolved by Planck, showing an elongated structure, which correlates well with\nthe morphology observed from X-rays, but extends beyond the observed X-ray\nsignal. We find a good agreement between the SZ signal (or Compton paranmeter,\ny_c) observed by Planck and the expected signal inferred from X-ray\nobservations and simple analytical models. Due to its proximity to us, the gas\nbeyond the virial radius can be studied with unprecedented sensitivity by\nintegrating the SZ signal over tens of square degrees. We study the signal in\nthe outskirts of Virgo and compare it with analytical models and a constrained\nsimulation of the environment of Virgo. Planck data suggest that significant\namounts of low-density plasma surround Virgo out to twice the virial radius. We\nfind the SZ signal in the outskirts of Virgo to be consistent with a simple\nmodel that extrapolates the inferred pressure at lower radii while assuming\nthat the temperature stays in the keV range beyond the virial radius. The\nobserved signal is also consistent with simulations and points to a shallow\npressure profile in the outskirts of the cluster. This reservoir of gas at\nlarge radii can be linked with the hottest phase of the elusive warm/hot\nintergalactic medium. Taking the lack of symmetry of Virgo into account, we\nfind that a prolate model is favoured by the combination of SZ and X-ray data,\nin agreement with predictions.\n", "  Cosmic acceleration is usually related with the unknown dark energy, which\nequation of state, w(z), is constrained and numerically confronted with\nindependent astrophysical data. In order to make a diagnostic of w(z), the\nintroduction of a null test of dark energy can be done using a diagnostic\nfunction of redshift, Om. In this work we present a nonparametric\nreconstruction of this diagnostic using the so-called Loess-Simex factory to\ntest the concordance model with the advantage that this approach offers an\nalternative way to relax the use of priors and find a possible 'w' that\nreliably describe the data with no previous knowledge of a cosmological model.\nOur results demonstrate that the method applied to the dynamical Om diagnostic\nfinds a preference for a dark energy model with equation of state w =-2/3,\nwhich correspond to a static domain wall network.\n", "  After a brief recall of the main impacts of stellar rotation on the structure\nand the evolution of stars, four topics are addressed: 1) the links between\nmagnetic fields and rotation; 2) the impact of rotation on the age\ndetermination of clusters; 3) the exchanges of angular momentum between the\norbit of a planet and the star due to tides; 4) the impact of rotation on the\nearly chemical evolution of the Milky Way and the origin of the\nCarbon-Enhanced-Metal-Poor stars.\n", "  We consider an implementation of the Elitzur-Vaidman bomb experiment in a\nDC-biased electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a leakage port on one of\nits arms playing the role of a \"lousy bom\". Many-body correlations tend to\nscreen out manifestations of interaction-free measurement. Analyzing the\ncorrelations between the current at the interformeter's drains and at the\nleakage port, we identify the limit where the originally proposed\nsingle-particle effect is recovered. Specifically, we find that in the regime\nof sufficiently diluted injected electron beam and short measurement times,\neffects of quantum mechanical wave-particle duality emerge in the cross-current\ncorrelations.\n", "  The secondary cosmic microwave background (CMB) $B$-modes stem from the\npost-decoupling distortion of the polarization $E$-modes due to the\ngravitational lensing effect of large-scale structures. These lensing-induced\n$B$-modes constitute both a valuable probe of the dark matter distribution and\nan important contaminant for the extraction of the primary CMB $B$-modes from\ninflation. Planck provides accurate nearly all-sky measurements of both the\npolarization $E$-modes and the integrated mass distribution via the\nreconstruction of the CMB lensing potential. By combining these two data\nproducts, we have produced an all-sky template map of the lensing-induced\n$B$-modes using a real-space algorithm that minimizes the impact of sky masks.\nThe cross-correlation of this template with an observed (primordial and\nsecondary) $B$-mode map can be used to measure the lensing $B$-mode power\nspectrum at multipoles up to $2000$. In particular, when cross-correlating with\nthe $B$-mode contribution directly derived from the Planck polarization maps,\nwe obtain lensing-induced $B$-mode power spectrum measurement at a significance\nlevel of $12\\,\\sigma$, which agrees with the theoretical expectation derived\nfrom the Planck best-fit $\\Lambda$CDM model. This unique nearly all-sky\nsecondary $B$-mode template, which includes the lensing-induced information\nfrom intermediate to small ($10\\lesssim \\ell\\lesssim 1000$) angular scales, is\ndelivered as part of the Planck 2015 public data release. It will be\nparticularly useful for experiments searching for primordial $B$-modes, such as\nBICEP2/Keck Array or LiteBIRD, since it will enable an estimate to be made of\nthe lensing-induced contribution to the measured total CMB $B$-modes.\n", "  The aim of this note is to remove an implausible assumption in Moser's\ntheorem \\cite{JM} to establish our new theorem 1 which gives a lower estimate\nfor the sum $p+c^2\\rho$ on Riemann hypothesis. Corollary 1 gives a rather\nplausible construction of infinitely many models of universe with positive\ndensity($\\rho$) and pressure($p$) since it makes use of the state equation in\nthe form of an inequality.\n", "  We present temperature dependences of the large and the small superconducting\ngaps measured directly by SnS-Andreev spectroscopy in various Fe-based\nsuperconductors and MgB$_2$. The experimental $\\Delta_{L,S}(T)$ are well-fitted\nwith a two-gap model based on Moskalenko and Suhl system of equations\n(supplemented with a BCS-integral renormalization). From the the fitting\nprocedure, we estimate the key attribute of superconducting state \\textemdash\nrelative electron-boson coupling constants and eigen BCS-ratios for both\ncondensates. Our results evidence for a driving role of a strong intraband\ncoupling in the bands with the large gap, whereas interband coupling is rather\nweak for all the superconductors under study.\n", "  Recent models for the large-scale Galactic magnetic fields in the literature\nhave been largely constrained by synchrotron emission and Faraday rotation\nmeasures. We use three different but representative models to compare their\npredicted polarized synchrotron and dust emission with that measured by the\nPlanck satellite. We first update these models to match the Planck synchrotron\nproducts using a common model for the cosmic-ray leptons. We discuss the impact\non this analysis of the ongoing problems of component separation in the Planck\nmicrowave bands and of the uncertain cosmic-ray spectrum. In particular, the\ninferred degree of ordering in the magnetic fields is sensitive to these\nsystematic uncertainties, and we further show the importance of considering the\nexpected variations in the observables in addition to their mean morphology. We\nthen compare the resulting simulated emission to the observed dust polarization\nand find that the dust predictions do not match the morphology in the Planck\ndata but underpredict the dust polarization away from the plane. We modify one\nof the models to roughly match both observables at high latitudes by increasing\nthe field ordering in the thin disc near the observer. Though this specific\nanalysis is dependent on the component separation issues, we present the\nimproved model as a proof of concept for how these studies can be advanced in\nfuture using complementary information from ongoing and planned observational\nprojects.\n", "  We construct a bosonic analog of a two-dimensional topological Dirac\nSemi-Metal (DSM). The low-energy description of the most basic 2D DSM model\nconsists of two Dirac cones at positions $\\pm\\mathbf{k}_0$ in momentum space.\nThe local stability of the Dirac cones is guaranteed by a composite symmetry\n$Z_2^{\\mathcal{TI}}$, where $\\mathcal{T}$ is time-reversal and $\\mathcal{I}$ is\ninversion. This model also exhibits interesting time-reversal and inversion\nsymmetry breaking electromagnetic responses. In this work we construct a\nbosonic version by replacing each Dirac cone with a copy of the $O(4)$\nNonlinear Sigma Model (NLSM) with topological theta term and theta angle\n$\\theta=\\pm \\pi$. One copy of this NLSM also describes the gapless surface\ntermination of the 3D Bosonic Topological Insulator (BTI). We compute the\ntime-reversal and inversion symmetry breaking electromagnetic responses for our\nmodel and show that they are twice the value one gets in the DSM case matching\nwhat one might expect from, for example, a bosonic Chern insulator. We also\ninvestigate the stability of the BSM model and find that the composite\n$Z_2^{\\mathcal{TI}}$ symmetry again plays an important role. Along the way we\nclarify many aspects of the surface theory of the BTI including the\nelectromagnetic response, the charges and statistics of vortex excitations, and\nthe stability to symmetry-allowed perturbations. We briefly comment on the\nrelation between the various descriptions of the $O(4)$ NLSM with $\\theta=\\pi$\nused in this paper (a dual vortex description and a description in terms of\nfour massless fermions) and the recently proposed dual description of the BTI\nsurface in terms of $2+1$ dimensional Quantum Electrodynamics with two flavors\nof fermion ($N=2$ QED$_3$). In a set of four Appendixes we review some of the\ntools used in the paper, and also derive some of the more technical results.\n", "  We introduce a new perspective and a generalization of spectral networks for\n4d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ theories of class $\\mathcal{S}$ associated to Lie algebras\n$\\mathfrak{g} = \\textrm{A}_n$, $\\textrm{D}_n$, $\\textrm{E}_{6}$, and\n$\\textrm{E}_{7}$. Spectral networks directly compute the BPS spectra of 2d\ntheories on surface defects coupled to the 4d theories. A Lie algebraic\ninterpretation of these spectra emerges naturally from our construction,\nleading to a new description of 2d-4d wall-crossing phenomena. Our construction\nalso provides an efficient framework for the study of BPS spectra of the 4d\ntheories. In addition, we consider novel types of surface defects associated\nwith minuscule representations of $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n", "  Understanding the formation of the extremely metal poor star\nSDSS-J102915+172927 is of fundamental importance to improve our knowledge on\nthe transition between the first and second generation of stars in the\nUniverse. In this paper, we perform three-dimensional cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations of dust-enriched halos during the early stages of\nthe collapse process including a detailed treatment of the dust physics. We\nemploy the astrochemistry package \\krome coupled with the hydrodynamical code\n\\textsc{enzo} assuming grain size distributions produced by the explosion of\ncore-collapse supernovae of 20 and 35 M$_\\odot$ primordial stars which are\nsuitable to reproduce the chemical pattern of the SDSS-J102915+172927 star. We\nfind that the dust mass yield produced from Population III supernovae\nexplosions is the most important factor which drives the thermal evolution and\nthe dynamical properties of the halos. Hence, for the specific distributions\nrelevant in this context, the composition, the dust optical properties, and the\nsize-range have only minor effects on the results due to similar cooling\nfunctions. We also show that the critical dust mass to enable fragmentation\nprovided by semi-analytical models should be revised, as we obtain values one\norder of magnitude larger. This determines the transition from disk\nfragmentation to a more filamentary fragmentation mode, and suggests that\nlikely more than one single supernova event or efficient dust growth should be\ninvoked to get such a high dust content.\n", "  We show how the choice of an inflationary state that entangles scalar and\ntensor fluctuations affects the angular two-point correlation functions of the\n$T$, $E$, and $B$ modes of the cosmic microwave background. The propagators for\na state starting with some general quadratic entanglement are solved exactly,\nleading to predictions for the primordial scalar-scalar, tensor-tensor, and\nscalar-tensor power spectra. These power spectra are expressed in terms of\ngeneral functions that describe the entangling structure of the initial state\nrelative to the standard Bunch-Davies vacuum. We illustrate how such a state\nwould modify the angular correlations in the CMB with a simple example where\nthe initial state is a small perturbation away from the Bunch-Davies state.\nBecause the state breaks some of the rotational symmetries, the angular power\nspectra no longer need be strictly diagonal.\n", "  A magnetic vortex has attracted significant attention since it is a\ntopologically stable magnetic structure in a soft magnetic nanodisk. Many\nstudies have been devoted to understanding the nature of magnetic vortex in\nisolated systems. Here we show a new aspect of a magnetic vortex the dynamics\nof which strongly affects the magnetic structures of environment. We exploit a\nnanodot of an exchange-coupled bilayer with a soft magnetic Ni81Fe19\n(permalloy; Py) having a magnetic vortex and a perpendicularly magnetized\nL10-FePt exhibiting a large switching field (Hsw). The vortex dynamics with\nazimuthal spin waves makes the excess energy accumulate in the Py, which\ntriggers the reversed-domain nucleation in the L10-FePt at a low magnetic\nfield. Our results shed light on the non-local mechanism of a reversed-domain\nnucleation, and provide with a route for efficient Hsw reduction that is needed\nfor ultralow-power spintronic devices.\n", "  We consider the problem of estimating multiple phases using a multi-mode\ninterferometer. In this setting we show that while global strategies with\nmulti-mode entanglement can lead to high precision gains, the same precision\nenhancements can be obtained with mode-separable states and local measurements.\nThe crucial resource for quantum enhancement is shown to be a large number\nvariance in the probe state, which can be obtained without any entanglement\nbetween the modes. This has important practical implications because local\nstrategies using separable states have many advantages over global schemes\nusing multi-mode-entangled states. Such advantages include a robustness to\nlocal estimation failure, more flexibility in the distribution of resources,\nand comparatively easier state preparation. We obtain our results by analyzing\ntwo different schemes: the first uses a set of interferometers, which can be\nused as a model for a network of quantum sensors, and the second looks at\nmeasuring a number of phases relative to a reference, which is concerned\nprimarily with quantum imaging.\n", "  The recovery of an exoplanet's atmospheric parameters from its spectrum\nrequires accurate knowledge of the spectral errors and covariances.\nUnfortunately, the complex image processing used in high-contrast\nintegral-field spectrograph (IFS) observations generally produces spectral\ncovariances that are poorly understood and often ignored. In this work, we show\nhow to measure the spectral errors and covariances and include them\nself-consistently in parameter retrievals. By combining model exoplanet spectra\nwith a realistic noise model generated from GPI early science data, we show\nthat ignoring spectral covariance in high-contrast IFS data can both bias\ninferred parameters and lead to unreliable confidence regions on those\nparameters. This problem is made worse by the common practice of scaling the\n$\\chi^2$ per degree of freedom to unity; the input parameters then fall outside\nthe $95\\%$ confidence regions in as many as ${\\sim}80\\%$ of noise realizations.\nThe biases we observe can approach the typical levels of precision achieved in\nhigh-contrast spectroscopy. Accounting for realistic priors in fully Bayesian\nretrievals can also have a significant impact on the inferred parameters.\nPlausible priors on effective temperature and surface gravity can vary by an\norder of magnitude across the confidence regions appropriate for objects with\nweak age constraints; priors for objects with good age constraints are\ndominated by modeling uncertainties. Our methods are directly applicable to\nexisting high-contrast IFSs including GPI and SPHERE, as well as upcoming\ninstruments like CHARIS and, ultimately, WFIRST-AFTA.\n", "  The transition from classical to quantum mechanics has intrigued scientists\nin the past and remains one of the most fundamental conceptual challenges in\nstate-of-the-art physics. Beyond the quantum mechanical correspondence\nprinciple, quantum-classical analogies have attracted considerable interest. In\nthis work, we present classical two-mode interference for a nanomechanical\ntwo-mode system, realizing classical St\\\"uckelberg interferometry. In the past,\nSt\\\"uckelberg interferometry has been investigated exclusively in quantum\nmechanical two-level systems. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a classical\nanalog of St\\\"uckelberg interferometry taking advantage of coherent energy\nexchange between two-strongly coupled, high quality factor nanomechanical\nresonator modes. Furthermore, we provide an exact theoretical solution for the\ndouble passage St\\\"uckelberg problem which reveals the analogy of the return\nprobabilities in the quantum mechanical and the classical version of the\nproblem. This result qualifies classical two-mode systems at large as a testbed\nfor quantum mechanical interferometry.\n", "  We present ground-based and Swift photometric and spectroscopic observations\nof the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-15oi, discovered at the center of\n2MASX J20390918-3045201 ($d\\simeq216$ Mpc) by the All-Sky Automated Survey for\nSuperNovae (ASAS-SN). The source peaked at a bolometric luminosity of\n$L\\simeq1.3\\times10^{44}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ and radiated a total energy of\n$E\\simeq6.6\\times10^{50}$ ergs over the first $\\sim3.5$ months of observations.\nThe early optical/UV emission of the source can be fit by a blackbody with\ntemperature increasing from $T\\sim2\\times10^4$ K to $T\\sim4\\times10^4$ K while\nthe luminosity declines from $L\\simeq1.3\\times10^{44}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ to\n$L\\simeq2.3\\times10^{43}$ ergs s$^{-1}$, requiring the photosphere to be\nshrinking rapidly. The optical/UV luminosity decline during this period is most\nconsistent with an exponential decline, $L\\propto e^{-(t-t_0)/\\tau}$, with\n$\\tau \\simeq46.5$ days for $t_0\\simeq57241.6$ (MJD), while a power-law decline\nof $L\\propto (t-t_0)^{-\\alpha}$ with $t_0\\simeq57212.3$ and $\\alpha=1.62$\nprovides a moderately worse fit. ASASSN-15oi also exhibits roughly constant\nsoft X-ray emission that is significantly weaker than the optical/UV emission.\nSpectra of the source show broad helium emission lines and strong blue\ncontinuum emission in early epochs, although these features fade rapidly and\nare not present $\\sim3$ months after discovery. The early spectroscopic\nfeatures and color evolution of ASASSN-15oi are consistent with a TDE, but the\nrapid spectral evolution is unique among optically-selected TDEs.\n", "  We demonstrate the first wavelength-tunable electrically-pumped source of\nnon-classical light that can emit photons with wavelength in resonance with the\nD2 transitions of 87Rb atoms. The device is fabricated by integrating a novel\nGaAs single-quantum-dot light-emitting-diode (LED) onto a piezoelectric\nactuator. By feeding the emitted photons into a 75-mm-long cell containing warm\n87Rb atom vapor, we observe slow-light with a temporal delay of up to 3.4 ns.\nIn view of the possibility of using 87Rb atomic vapors as quantum memories,\nthis work makes an important step towards the realization of hybrid-quantum\nsystems for future quantum networks.\n", "  The topic of photonic topological insulators and scattering-protected edge\nstates bridges concepts from condensed matter physics and electromagnetics, and\nnecessitates understanding the Berry potential and related concepts. These\nnotes are an attempt at a moderately self-contained introduction to the topic,\nincluding two detailed photonic examples drawn from the literature. We made\nthese notes in the process of trying to understand this topic ourselves, and we\nare posting this material in the spirit of helping other researchers start to\nunderstand this material. We claim no novelty in the material or its\npresentation.\n", "  We present a catalog of 624 radio sources detected around the North Celestial\nPole (NCP) with the 21 Centimeter Array (21CMA), a radio interferometer\ndedicated to the statistical measurement of the epoch of reionization (EoR).\nThe data are taken from a 12 h observation made on 2013 April 13, with a\nfrequency coverage from 75 to 175 MHz and an angular resolution of ~ 4 arcmin.\nThe catalog includes flux densities at eight sub-bands across the 21CMA\nbandwidth and provides the in-band spectral indices for the detected sources.\nTo reduce the complexity of interferometric imaging from the so-called \"w\" term\nand ionospheric effects, the present analysis are restricted to the east-west\nbaselines within 1500 m only. The 624 radio sources are found within 5 degrees\naround the NCP down to ~ 0.1 Jy. Our source counts are compared, and also\nexhibit a good agreement, with deep low-frequency observations made recently\nwith the GMRT and MWA. In particular, for fainter radio sources below ~ 1 Jy,\nwe find a flattening trend of source counts towards lower frequencies. While\nthe thermal noise (~0.4 mJy) is well controlled to below the confusion limit,\nthe dynamical range (~10^4) and sensitivity of current 21CMA imaging is largely\nlimited by calibration and deconvolution errors, especially the grating lobes\nof very bright sources, such as 3C061.1, in the NCP field which result from the\nregular spacings of the 21CMA. We note that particular attention should be paid\nto the extended sources, and their modeling and removals may constitute a large\ntechnical challenge for current EoR experiments. Our analysis may serve as a\nuseful guide to design of next generation low-frequency interferometers like\nthe Square Kilometre Array.\n", "  We propose a scalable architecture for a quantum network based on a simple\non-chip photonic circuit that performs loss-tolerant two-qubit measurements.\nThe circuit consists of two quantum emitters positioned in the arms of an\non-chip Mach-Zehnder interferometer composed of waveguides with chiral\nlight--matter interfaces. The efficient chiral light--matter interaction allows\nthe emitters to perform high-fidelity intranode two-qubit parity measurements\nwithin a single chip, and to emit photons to generate internode entanglement,\nwithout any need for reconfiguration. We show that by connecting multiple\ncircuits of this kind into a quantum network, it is possible to perform\nuniversal quantum computation with heralded two-qubit gate fidelities ${\\cal F}\n\\sim 0.998$ achievable in state-of-the-art quantum dot systems.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate a nonlinear detection scheme exploiting\ntime-reversal dynamics that disentangles continuous variable entangled states\nfor feasible readout. Spin-exchange dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates is\nused as the nonlinear mechanism which not only generates entangled states but\ncan also be time reversed by controlled phase imprinting. For demonstration of\na quantum-enhanced measurement we construct an active atom SU(1,1)\ninterferometer, where entangled state preparation and nonlinear readout both\nconsist of parametric amplification. This scheme is capable of exhausting the\nquantum resource by detecting solely mean atom numbers. Controlled nonlinear\ntransformations widen the spectrum of useful entangled states for applied\nquantum technologies.\n", "  We report evidence of a narrow structure, $X(5568)$, in the decay sequence\n$X(5568) \\rightarrow B_s^0 \\pi^{\\pm}$, $B_s^0 \\rightarrow J/\\psi \\phi$,\n$J/\\psi\\rightarrow \\mu^+ \\mu^-$, $\\phi \\rightarrow K^+K^-$. This is evidence\nfor the first instance of a hadronic state with valence quarks of four\ndifferent flavors. The mass and natural width of this state are measured to be\n$m = 5567.8 \\pm 2.9 {\\rm \\thinspace (stat)} ^{+0.9}_{-1.9} {\\rm \\thinspace\n(syst)}$ MeV/$c^2$ and $\\Gamma = 21.9 \\pm 6.4 {\\rm \\thinspace (stat)}\n^{+5.0}_{-2.5} {\\rm \\thinspace (syst)} $ MeV/$c^2$. If the decay is $X(5568)\n\\rightarrow B_s^* \\pi^{\\pm} \\rightarrow B_s^0 \\gamma \\pi^{\\pm}$ with an unseen\n$\\gamma$, $m(X(5568))$ will be shifted up by $m(B_s^*) - m(B_s^0) \\sim 49$\nMeV/$c^2$. This measurement is based on $10.4~\\rm{fb^{-1}}$ of $p \\bar p $\ncollision data at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 1.96 TeV collected by the D0 experiment at the\nFermilab Tevatron collider.\n", "  The BOSS quasar sample is used to study cosmic homogeneity with a 3D survey\nin the redshift range $2.2<z<2.8$. We measure the count-in-sphere, $N(<\\! r)$,\ni.e. the average number of objects around a given object, and its logarithmic\nderivative, the fractal correlation dimension, $D_2(r)$. For a homogeneous\ndistribution $N(<\\! r) \\propto r^3$ and $D_2(r)=3$. Due to the uncertainty on\ntracer density evolution, 3D surveys can only probe homogeneity up to a\nredshift dependence, i.e. they probe so-called \"spatial isotropy\". Our data\ndemonstrate spatial isotropy of the quasar distribution in the redshift range\n$2.2<z<2.8$ in a model-independent way, independent of any FLRW fiducial\ncosmology, resulting in $3-\\langle D_2 \\rangle < 1.7 \\times 10^{-3}$ (2\n$\\sigma$) over the range $250<r<1200 \\, h^{-1}$Mpc for the quasar distribution.\nIf we assume that quasars do not have a bias much less than unity, this implies\nspatial isotropy of the matter distribution on large scales. Then, combining\nwith the Copernican principle, we finally get homogeneity of the matter\ndistribution on large scales. Alternatively, using a flat $\\Lambda$CDM fiducial\ncosmology with CMB-derived parameters, and measuring the quasar bias relative\nto this $\\Lambda$CDM model, our data provide a consistency check of the model,\nin terms of how homogeneous the Universe is on different scales. $D_2(r)$ is\nfound to be compatible with our $\\Lambda$CDM model on the whole $10<r<1200 \\,\nh^{-1}$Mpc range. For the matter distribution we obtain $3-\\langle D_2 \\rangle\n< 5 \\times 10^{-5}$ (2 $\\sigma$) over the range $250<r<1200 \\, h^{-1}$Mpc,\nconsistent with homogeneity on large scales.\n", "  We present a new technique for wide and shallow observations using the\nnear-infrared channel of Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST). Wide-field near-IR surveys with HST are generally inefficient,\nas guide star acquisitions make it impractical to observe more than one\npointing per orbit. This limitation can be circumvented by guiding with gyros\nalone, which is possible as long as the telescope has three functional gyros.\nThe method presented here allows us to observe mosaics of eight independent\nWFC3-IR pointings in a single orbit by utilizing the fact that HST drifts by\nonly a very small amount in the 25 seconds between non-destructive reads of\nunguided exposures. By shifting the reads and treating them as independent\nexposures the full resolution of WFC3 can be restored. We use this \"drift and\nshift\" (DASH) method in the Cycle 23 COSMOS-DASH program, which will obtain 456\nWFC3 $H_{160}$ pointings in 57 orbits, covering an area of 0.6 degree$^2$ in\nthe COSMOS field down to $H_{160} = 25$. When completed, the program will more\nthan triple the area of extra-galactic survey fields covered by near-IR imaging\nat HST resolution. We demonstrate the viability of the method with the first\nfour orbits (32 pointings) of this program. We show that the resolution of the\nWFC3 camera is preserved, and that structural parameters of galaxies are\nconsistent with those measured in guided observations.\n", "  We analyze 24 binary radio pulsars in the North American Nanohertz\nObservatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) nine-year data set. We make\nfourteen significant measurements of Shapiro delay, including new detections in\nfour pulsar-binary systems (PSRs J0613$-$0200, J2017+0603, J2302+4442, and\nJ2317+1439), and derive estimates of the binary-component masses and orbital\ninclination for these MSP-binary systems. We find a wide range of binary pulsar\nmasses, with values as low as $m_{\\rm p} =\n1.18^{+0.10}_{-0.09}\\text{M}_{\\odot}$ for PSR J1918$-$0642 and as high as\n$m_{\\rm p} = 1.928^{+0.017}_{-0.017}\\text{M}_{\\odot}$ for PSR J1614$-$2230\n(both 68.3\\% credibility). We make an improved measurement of the Shapiro\ntiming delay in the PSR J1918$-$0642 and J2043+1711 systems, measuring the\npulsar mass in the latter system to be $m_{\\rm p} =\n1.41^{+0.21}_{-0.18}\\text{M}_{\\odot}$ (68.3\\% credibility) for the first time.\nWe measure secular variations of one or more orbital elements in many systems,\nand use these measurements to further constrain our estimates of the pulsar and\ncompanion masses whenever possible. In particular, we used the observed Shapiro\ndelay and periastron advance due to relativistic gravity in the PSR J1903+0327\nsystem to derive a pulsar mass of $m_{\\rm p} =\n1.65^{+0.02}_{-0.02}\\text{M}_{\\odot}$ (68.3\\% credibility). We discuss the\nimplications that our mass measurements have on the overall neutron-star mass\ndistribution, and on the \"mass/orbital-period\" correlation due to extended mass\ntransfer.\n", "  In the past several decades, the standard cosmological model has been\nestablished and its parameters have been measured to a high precision, while\nthere are still many of the fundamental questions in cosmology; such as the\nphysics in the very early Universe, the origin of the cosmic acceleration and\nthe nature of the dark matter. The future world's largest radio telescope,\nSquare Kilometre Array (SKA), will be able to open the new frontier of\ncosmology and will be one of the most powerful tools for cosmology in the next\ndecade. The cosmological surveys conducted by the SKA would have the potential\nnot only to answer these fundamental questions but also deliver the precision\ncosmology. In this article we briefly review the role of the SKA from the view\npoint of the modern cosmology. The cosmology science led by the SKA-Japan\nConsortium (SKA-JP) Cosmology Science Working Group is also discussed.\n", "  We investigate how confining a transverse spatial dimension influences the\nfew- and many-body properties of non-relativistic bosons with pointlike\ninteractions. Our main focus is on the dimensional crossover from three to two\ndimensions, which is of relevance for ultracold atom experiments. Using\nFunctional Renormalization Group equations and T-matrix calculations we study\nhow the phase transition temperature changes as a function of the spatial\nextent of the transverse dimension and relate the 3D and 2D s-wave scattering\nlengths. The analysis reveals how the properties of the lower-dimensional\nsystem are inherited from the higher-dimensional one during the renormalization\ngroup evolution. We limit the discussion to confinements in a potential well\nwith periodic boundary conditions and argue why this qualitatively captures the\nphysics of other compactifications such as transverse harmonic confinement as\nin cold atom experiments.\n", "  The morphology of massive star-forming galaxies at high redshift is often\ndominated by giant clumps of mass ~10^8-10^9 Msun and size ~100-1000 pc.\nPrevious studies have proposed that giant clumps might have an important role\nin the evolution of their host galaxy, particularly in building the central\nbulge. However, this depends on whether clumps live long enough to migrate from\ntheir original location in the disc or whether they get disrupted by their own\nstellar feedback before reaching the centre of the galaxy. We use cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulations from the FIRE (Feedback in Realistic Environments)\nproject that implement explicit treatments of stellar feedback and ISM physics\nto study the properties of these clumps. We follow the evolution of giant\nclumps in a massive (stellar mass ~10^10.8 Msun at z=1), discy, gas-rich galaxy\nfrom redshift z>2 to z=1. Even though the clumpy phase of this galaxy lasts\nover a gigayear, individual gas clumps are short-lived, with mean lifetime of\nmassive clumps of ~20 Myr. During that time, they turn between 0.1% and 20% of\ntheir gas into stars before being disrupted, similar to local GMCs. Clumps with\nM>10^7 Msun account for ~20% of the total star formation in the galaxy during\nthe clumpy phase, producing ~10^10 Msun of stars. We do not find evidence for\nnet inward migration of clumps within the galaxy. The number of giant clumps\nand their mass decrease at lower redshifts, following the decrease in the\noverall gas fraction and star-formation rate.\n", "  Although infrared (IR) overall dust emission from clusters of galaxies has\nbeen statistically detected using data from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite\n(IRAS), it has not been possible to sample the spectral energy distribution\n(SED) of this emission over its peak, and thus to break the degeneracy between\ndust temperature and mass. By complementing the IRAS spectral coverage with\nPlanck satellite data from 100 to 857 GHz, we provide new constraints on the IR\nspectrum of thermal dust emission in clusters of galaxies. We achieve this by\nusing a stacking approach for a sample of several hundred objects from the\nPlanck cluster sample; this procedure averages out fluctuations from the IR\nsky, allowing us to reach a significant detection of the faint cluster\ncontribution. We also use the large frequency range probed by Planck, together\nwith component-separation techniques, to remove the contamination from both\ncosmic microwave background anisotropies and the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich\neffect (tSZ) signal, which dominate below 353 GHz. By excluding dominant\nspurious signals or systematic effects, averaged detections are reported at\nfrequencies between 353 and 5000 GHz. We confirm the presence of dust in\nclusters of galaxies at low and intermediate redshifts, yielding an SED with a\nshape similar to that of the Milky Way. Planck's beam does not allow us to\ninvestigate the detailed spatial distribution of this emission (e.g., whether\nit comes from intergalactic dust or simply the dust content of the cluster\ngalaxies), but the radial distribution of the emission appears to follow that\nof the stacked SZ signal, and thus the extent of the clusters. The recovered\nSED allows us to constrain the dust mass responsible for the signal, as well as\nits temperature. We additionally explore the evolution of the IR emission as a\nfunction of cluster mass and redshift.\n", "  We study the effect of strong magnetic fields, of the order of\n$10^{15}-10^{17}$ G, on the extension of the crust of magnetized neutron stars.\nThe dynamical instability region of neutron-proton-electron ($npe$) matter at\nsubsaturation densities and the mode with the largest growth rate are\ndetermined within a relativistic mean field model. It is shown that a strong\nmagnetic field has a large effect on the instability region, defining the\ncrust-core transition as a wide density range.\n", "  Rare earth ions have exceptionally long coherence times, making them an\nexcellent candidate for quantum information processing. A key part of this\nprocessing is quantum state transfer. We show that perfect state transfer can\nbe achieved by time reversing the intermediate quantum channel, and suggest\nusing a gradient echo memory (GEM) to perform this time reversal. We propose an\nexperiment with rare earth ions to verify these predictions, where an emitter\nand receiver crystal are connected with an optical channel passed through a\nGEM. We investigate the affect experimental imperfections and collective\ndynamics have on the state transfer process. We demonstrate superrandiant\neffects can enhance coupling into the optical channel and improve the transfer\nfidelity. We lastly discuss how our results apply to state transfer of\nentangled states.\n", "  We construct a practical method for finding optimal Gaussian probe states for\nthe estimation of parameters encoded by Gaussian unitary channels. This method\ncan be used for finding all optimal probe states, rather than focusing on the\nperformance of specific states as shown in previous studies. As an example, we\napply this method to find optimal probes for the channel that combines the\nphase-change and squeezing channels, and for generalized two-mode squeezing and\nmode-mixing channels. The method enables a comprehensive study of temperature\neffects in Gaussian parameter estimation. It has been shown that the precision\nin parameter estimation using single mode states can be enhanced by increasing\nthe temperature of the probe. We show that not only higher temperature, but\nalso larger temperature differences between modes of a Gaussian probe state can\nenhance the estimation precision.\n", "  Two vortex rings can form a localized configuration whereby they continually\npass through one another in an alternating fashion. This phenomenon is called\nleapfrogging. Using parameters suitable for superfluid helium-4, we describe a\nrecurrence phenomenon that is similar to leapfrogging, which occurs for two\ncoaxial straight vortex filaments with the same Kelvin wave mode. For\nsmall-amplitude Kelvin waves we demonstrate that our full Biot-Savart\nsimulations closely follow predictions obtained from a simpified model that\nprovides an analytical approximation developed for nearly parallel vortices.\nOur results are also relevant to thin-cored helical vortices in classical\nfluids.\n", "  We consider last passage percolation (LPP) models with exponentially\ndistributed random variables, which are linked to the totally asymmetric simple\nexclusion process (TASEP). The competition interface for LPP was introduced and\nstudied by Ferrari and Pimentel in [Ann. Probab. 33 (2005), 1235-1254] for\ncases where the corresponding exclusion process had a rarefaction fan. Here we\nconsider situations with a shock and determine the law of the fluctuations of\nthe competition interface around its deterministic law of large number\nposition. We also study the multipoint distribution of the LPP around the\nshock, extending our one-point result of [Probab. Theory Relat. Fields 61\n(2015), 61-109].\n", "  We investigate the behavior of the return amplitude ${\\cal F}(t)=\n|\\langle\\Psi(0)|\\Psi(t)\\rangle|$ following a quantum quench in a conformal\nfield theory (CFT) on a compact spatial manifold of dimension $d-1$ and linear\nsize $O(L)$, from a state $|\\Psi(0)\\rangle$ of extensive energy with\nshort-range correlations. After an initial gaussian decay ${\\cal F}(t)$ reaches\na plateau value related to the density of available states at the initial\nenergy. However for $d=3,4$ this value is attained from below after a single\noscillation. For a holographic CFT the plateau persists up to times at least\n$O(\\sigma^{1/(d-1)} L)$, where $\\sigma\\gg1$ is the dimensionless\nStefan-Boltzmann constant. On the other hand for a free field theory on\nmanifolds with high symmetry there are typically revivals at times\n$t\\sim\\mbox{integer}\\times L$. In particular, on a sphere $S_{d-1}$ of\ncircumference $2\\pi L$, there is an action of the modular group on ${\\cal\nF}(t)$ implying structure near all rational values of $t/L$, similarly to what\nhappens for rational CFTs in $d=2$.\n", "  In this work an application of the $\\kappa$--deformed algebra in condensed\nmatter physics is presented. Starting by the $\\kappa$--deformed Dirac equation\nwe study the relativistic generalization of the $\\kappa$--deformed Landau\nlevels as well as the consequences of the deformation on the Hall conductivity.\nBy comparing the $\\kappa$--deformed Landau levels in the nonrelativistic regime\nwith the energy levels of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in the presence\nof a normal magnetic field, upper bounds for the deformation parameter in\ndifferent materials are established. An expression for the $\\kappa$--deformed\nHall conductivity of a 2DEG is obtained as well. The expression recovers the\nwell-known result for the usual Hall conductivity in the limit\n$\\varepsilon=\\kappa^{-1}\\to 0$. The deformation parameter breaks the Landau\nlevels degeneracy and due to this, it is observed that deformation gives rise\nto new plateaus of conductivity in a such way that the plateaus widths of the\n$\\kappa$--deformed Hall conductivity are less than the usual one. By studying\nthe temperature dependence of the $\\kappa$--deformed Hall conductivity, we show\nthat an increase of the temperature causes the smearing of the plateaus and a\ndiminution of the effect of the deformation, whilst an increase in the magnetic\nfield enhances the effect of the deformation.\n", "  We investigate both theoretically and experimentally the dynamics of\nentanglement and non-locality for two qubits immersed in a global pure\ndephasing environment. We demonstrate the existence of a class of states for\nwhich entanglement is forever frozen during the dynamics, even if the state of\nthe system does evolve. At the same time non-local correlations, quantified by\nthe violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, either\nundergo sudden death or are trapped during the dynamics.\n", "  Direct numerical simulations (DNSs) are performed to analyze the global\ntransport properties of turbulent Taylor-Couette flow with inner rough wall up\nto Taylor number $Ta=10^{10}$. The dimensionless torque $Nu_\\omega$ shows an\neffective scaling of $Nu_\\omega \\propto Ta^{0.42\\pm0.01}$, which is steeper\nthan the ultimate regime effective scaling $Nu_\\omega \\propto Ta^{0.38}$ seen\nfor smooth inner and outer walls. It is found that at the inner rough wall, the\ndominant contribution to the torque comes from the pressure forces on the\nradial faces of the rough elements; while viscous shear stresses on the rough\nsurfaces contribute little to $Nu_\\omega$. Thus, the log layer close to the\nrough wall depends on the roughness length scale, rather than on the viscous\nlength scale. We then separate the torque contributed from the smooth inner\nwall and the rough outer wall. It is found that the smooth wall torque scaling\nfollows $Nu_s \\propto Ta_s^{0.38\\pm0.01}$, in excellent agreement with the case\nwhere both walls are smooth. In contrast, the rough wall torque scaling follows\n$Nu_r \\propto Ta_r^{0.47\\pm0.03}$, very close to the pure ultimate regime\nscaling $Nu_\\omega \\propto Ta^{1/2}$. The energy dissipation rate at the wall\nof inner rough cylinder decreases significantly as a consequence of the wall\nshear stress reduction caused by the flow separation at the rough elements. On\nthe other hand, the latter shed vortices in the bulk that are transported\ntowards the outer cylinder and dissipated. Compared to the purely smooth case,\nthe inner wall roughness renders the system more bulk dominated and thus\nincreases the effective scaling exponent.\n", "  Subaru/SuprimeCam narrowband photometry of the SSA22 field reveals the\npresence of four Lyman continuum (LyC) candidates among a sample of 14 AGN. Two\nshow offsets and likely have stellar LyC in nature or are foreground\ncontaminants. The remaining two LyC candidates are Type I AGN. We argue that\nthe average LyC escape fraction of high redshift low luminosity AGN is not\nlikely to be unity, as often assumed in the literature. From direct measurement\nwe obtain the average LyC-to-UV flux density ratio and ionizing emissivity for\na number of AGN classes and find it at least a factor of two lower than values\nobtained assuming f_esc = 1. Comparing to recent Ly{\\alpha} forest\nmeasurements, AGNs at redshift z~3 make up at most ~12% and as little as ~5% of\nthe total ionizing budget. Our results suggest that AGNs are unlikely to\ndominate the ionization budget of the Universe at high redshifts.\n", "  We introduce a novel apparatus designed for stress-controlled rheometers to\nperform simultaneous rheological and electrical measurements on strongly\nconductive complex fluids under shear. By means of a non-toxic liquid metal at\nroom temperature, the electrical connection to the rotating shaft is completed\nwith minimal additional mechanical friction, allowing for simultaneous stress\nmeasurements as low as 1 Pa. We use the capabilities of this design to perform\nan extensive set of rheo-electric experiments on gels formulated from\nattractive carbon black particles, at concentrations ranging from 4 to 15% wt.\nFirst, experiments on gels at rest prepared with different shear history show a\nrobust power-law scaling between the elastic modulus $G'_0$ and the\nconductivity $\\sigma_0$ of the gels, i.e. $G'_0 \\sim \\sigma_0^\\alpha$, with\n$\\alpha =1.65 \\pm 0.04$ independently of the gel concentration. Second,\nconductivity measurements performed simultaneously with creep experiments\nreveal for the first time that plastic events take place in the bulk while the\nshear rate decreases as a weak power law of time in the early stage of the\nexperiment. The subsequent evolution of the conductivity and shear rate allows\nus to propose a local yielding scenario that is in agreement with previous\nvelocimetry measurements. Finally, we determine the constitutive rheological\nand electrical behavior of carbon black gels. Corrections first introduced for\nmechanical measurements are carefully extended to electrical measurements to\naccurately distinguish between bulk and surface contributions to the\nconductivity. As an illustrative example, we examine the constitutive\nrheo-electric properties of five carbon black gels of different grades, and\ndemonstrate the relevance of the novel rheo-electric apparatus as a versatile\ncharacterization tool for strongly conductive complex fluids and their\napplications.\n", "  We present basic statistics for all supernovae discovered by the All-Sky\nAutomated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) during its first year-and-a-half of\noperations, spanning 2013 and 2014. We also present the same information for\nall other bright ($m_V\\leq17$), spectroscopically confirmed supernovae\ndiscovered from 2014 May 1 through the end of 2014, providing a comparison to\nthe ASAS-SN sample starting from the point where ASAS-SN became operational in\nboth hemispheres. In addition, we present collected redshifts and near-UV\nthrough IR magnitudes, where available, for all host galaxies of the bright\nsupernovae in both samples. This work represents a comprehensive catalog of\nbright supernovae and their hosts from multiple professional and amateur\nsources, allowing for population studies that were not previously possible\nbecause the all-sky emphasis of ASAS-SN redresses many previously existing\nbiases. In particular, ASAS-SN systematically finds bright supernovae closer to\nthe centers of host galaxies than either other professional surveys or\namateurs, a remarkable result given ASAS-SN's poorer angular resolution. This\nis the first of a series of yearly papers on bright supernovae and their hosts\nthat will be released by the ASAS-SN team.\n", "  We study the statistical properties of interstellar dust polarization at high\nGalactic latitude, using the Stokes parameter Planck maps at 353 GHz. Our aim\nis to advance the understanding of the magnetized interstellar medium (ISM),\nand to provide a model of the polarized dust foreground for cosmic microwave\nbackground component-separation procedures. Focusing on the southern Galactic\ncap, we examine the statistical distributions of the polarization fraction\n($p$) and angle ($\\psi$) to characterize the ordered and turbulent components\nof the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) in the solar neighbourhood. We relate\npatterns at large angular scales in polarization to the orientation of the mean\n(ordered) GMF towards Galactic coordinates $(l_0,b_0)=(70^\\circ \\pm\n5^\\circ,24^\\circ \\pm 5^\\circ)$. The histogram of $p$ shows a wide dispersion up\nto 25 %. The histogram of $\\psi$ has a standard deviation of $12^\\circ$ about\nthe regular pattern expected from the ordered GMF. We use these histograms to\nbuild a phenomenological model of the turbulent component of the GMF, assuming\na uniform effective polarization fraction ($p_0$) of dust emission. To model\nthe Stokes parameters, we approximate the integration along the line of sight\n(LOS) as a sum over a set of $N$ independent polarization layers, in each of\nwhich the turbulent component of the GMF is obtained from Gaussian realizations\nof a power-law power spectrum. We are able to reproduce the observed $p$ and\n$\\psi$ distributions using: a $p_0$ value of (26 $\\pm$ 3)%; a ratio of 0.9\n$\\pm$ 0.1 between the strengths of the turbulent and mean components of the\nGMF; and a small value of $N$. We relate the polarization layers to the density\nstructure and to the correlation length of the GMF along the LOS.\n", "  We present an overview of the Carnegie-Chicago Hubble Program, an ongoing\nprogram to obtain a 3 per cent measurement of the Hubble constant using\nalternative methods to the traditional Cepheid distance scale. We aim to\nestablish a completely independent route to the Hubble constant using RR Lyrae\nvariables, the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB), and Type Ia supernovae (SNe\nIa). This alternative distance ladder can be applied to galaxies of any Hubble\nType, of any inclination, and, utilizing old stars in low density environments,\nis robust to the degenerate effects of metallicity and interstellar extinction.\nGiven the relatively small number of SNe Ia host galaxies with independently\nmeasured distances, these properties provide a great systematic advantage in\nthe measurement of the Hubble constant via the distance ladder. Initially, the\naccuracy of our value of the Hubble constant will be set by the five Galactic\nRR Lyrae calibrators with Hubble Space Telescope Fine-Guidance Sensor\nparallaxes. With Gaia, both the RR Lyrae zero point and TRGB method will be\nindependently calibrated, the former with at least an order of magnitude more\ncalibrators and the latter directly through parallax measurement of tip red\ngiants. As the first end-to-end \"distance ladder\" completely independent of\nboth Cepheid variables and the Large Magellanic Cloud, this path to the Hubble\nconstant will allow for the high precision comparison at each rung of the\ntraditional distance ladder that is necessary to understand tensions between\nthis and other routes to the Hubble constant.\n", "  In the framework of teleparallel equivalent of general relativity, we study a\ngravity theory where a scalar field beyond its minimal coupling, is also\ncoupled with the vector torsion through a non-minimal derivative coupling.\nAfter a suitable choice of auxiliary variables that allows us to perform the\nphase-space analysis of the model we obtain the critical points and their\nstability. While there is no scaling attractor in non-interacting scenario, by\nconsidering an interaction between dark energy and dark matter, we find scaling\nattractors in which the fractional densities of dark energy and matter are\nnon-vanishing constants over there. The universe can evolve to these scaling\nattractors regardless of initial conditions and the cosmological coincidence\nproblem could be alleviated without fine-tunings.\n", "  The perturbative approach to structure formation has recently received a lot\nof attention in the literature. In such setups the final predictions for\nobservables like the power spectrum is often derived under additional\napproximations such as a simplified time dependence. Here we provide all-order\nperturbative integral solutions for density and velocity fields in generalized\ncosmologies, with a direct application to clustering quintessence. We go beyond\nthe standard results based on extending the EdS-like approximations. As an\nillustrative example, we apply our findings to the calculation of the one-loop\npower spectrum of density and momentum fields. We find corrections close to\n$1\\%$ in the mildly non-linear regime of $\\Lambda$CDM cosmologies for the\ndensity power spectrum, while in the case of the density-momentum power\nspectrum effects can reach up to $1.5\\%$ for $k\\sim 0.2h/$Mpc.\n", "  We study three dimensional Bose and Fermi gases in the upper branch, a phase\ndefined by the absence of bound states in the repulsive interaction regime,\nwithin an approximation that considers only two-body interactions. Employing a\nformalism based on the S-matrix, we derive useful analytic expressions that\nhold on the upper branch in the weak coupling limit. We determine upper branch\nphase diagrams for both bosons and fermions with techniques valid for arbitrary\npositive scattering length.\n", "  We investigate the burstiness of star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies\nat $0.4<z<1$ by using the ratio of star formation rates (SFRs) measured from\nH$\\beta$ and FUV (1500 \\AA) (H$\\beta$--to--FUV ratio). Our sample contains 164\ngalaxies down to stellar mass (M*) of $10^{8.5} M_\\odot$ in the CANDELS GOODS-N\nregion, where Team Keck Redshift Survey DEIMOS spectroscopy and HST/WFC3 F275W\nimages from CANDELS and Hubble Deep UV Legacy Survey are available. When the\n{\\it ratio} of H$\\beta$- and FUV-derived SFRs is measured, dust extinction\ncorrection is negligible (except for very dusty galaxies) with the Calzetti\nattenuation curve. The H$\\beta$--to--FUV ratio of our sample increases with M*\nand SFR. The median ratio is $\\sim$0.7 at M*$\\sim10^{8.5} M_\\odot$ (or SFR$\\sim\n0.5 M_\\odot/yr$) and increases to $\\sim$1 at M*$\\sim10^{10} M_\\odot$ (or SFR\n$\\sim 10 M_\\odot/yr$). At M*$<10^{9.5} M_\\odot$, our median H$\\beta$--to--FUV\nratio is lower than that of local galaxies at the same M*, implying a redshift\nevolution. Bursty SFH on a timescale of a few tens of megayears on galactic\nscales provides a plausible explanation of our results, and the importance of\nthe burstiness increases as M* decreases. Due to sample selection effects, our\nH$\\beta$--to--FUV ratio may be an upper limit of the true value of a complete\nsample, which strengthens our conclusions. Other models, e.g., non-universal\ninitial mass function or stochastic star formation on star cluster scales, are\nunable to plausibly explain our results.\n", "  Upcoming space-based coronagraphic instruments in the next decade will\nperform reflected light spectroscopy and photometry of cool, directly imaged\nextrasolar giant planets. We are developing a new atmospheric retrieval\nmethodology to help assess the science return and inform the instrument design\nfor such future missions, and ultimately interpret the resulting observations.\nOur retrieval technique employs a geometric albedo model coupled with both a\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo Ensemble Sampler (emcee) and a multimodal nested\nsampling algorithm (MultiNest) to map the posterior distribution. This\ncombination makes the global evidence calculation more robust for any given\nmodel, and highlights possible discrepancies in the likelihood maps. As a\nproof-of-concept, our current atmospheric model contains 1 or 2 cloud layers,\nmethane as a major absorber, and a H$_2$-He background gas. This 6-to-9\nparameter model is appropriate for Jupiter-like planets and can be easily\nexpanded in the future. In addition to deriving the marginal likelihood\ndistribution and confidence intervals for the model parameters, we perform\nmodel selection to determine the significance of methane and cloud detection as\na function of expected signal-to-noise in the presence of spectral noise\ncorrelations. After internal validation, the method is applied to realistic\nspectra of Jupiter, Saturn, and HD 99492 c, a model observing target. We find\nthat the presence or absence of clouds and methane can be determined with high\nconfidence, while parameter uncertainties are model-dependent and correlated.\nSuch general methods will also be applicable to the interpretation of direct\nimaging spectra of cloudy terrestrial planets.\n", "  A concordance model for angular momentum evolution has been developed by\nmultiple investigators. This approach postulates that star forming regions and\nclusters are an evolutionary sequence which can be modeled with assumptions\nabout the coupling between protostars and accretion disks, angular momentum\nloss from magnetized winds that saturates in a mass-dependent fashion at high\nrotation rates, and core-envelope decoupling for solar analogs. We test this\napproach by combining established data with the large h Per dataset from the\nMONITOR project and new low-mass Pleiades data. We confirm prior results that\nyoung low-mass stars can be used to test star-disk coupling and angular\nmomentum loss independent of the treatment of internal angular momentum\ntransport. For slow rotators, we confirm the need for star-disk interactions to\nevolve the ONC to older systems, using h Per (age 13~Myr) as our natural\npost-disk case. Further interactions are not required to evolve slow rotators\nfrom h Per to older systems, implying no justification for extremely long-lived\ndisks as an alternative to core-envelope decoupling. However, our wind models\ncannot evolve rapid rotators from h Per to older systems consistently; this\nappears to be a general problem for any wind model that becomes ineffective in\nlow-mass young stars. We outline two possible solutions: either there is cosmic\nvariance in the distribution of stellar rotation rates in different clusters or\nthere are substantially enhanced torques in low-mass rapid rotators. We favor\nthe former explanation and discuss observational tests that could be used to\ndistinguish them. If the distribution of initial conditions depends on\nenvironment, models which test parameters by assuming a universal underlying\ndistribution of initial conditions will need to be re-evaluated.\n", "  Mobile impurities in cold atomic gases constitute a new platform for\ninvestigating polaron physics. Here we show that when impurity atoms interact\nwith a two-dimensional Fermi gas with quadratic band touching the polaron\npicture may either hold or break down depending on the particle-hole asymmetry\nof the band structure. If the hole band has a smaller effective mass than the\nparticle band, the quasiparticle is stable and its diffusion coefficient varies\nwith temperature as $D(T) \\propto \\ln^2 T$. If the hole band has larger mass,\nthe quasiparticle weight vanishes at low energies due to an emergent\northogonality catastrophe. In this case we map the problem onto a set of\none-dimensional channels and use conformal field theory techniques to obtain\n$D(T)\\propto T^{\\nu}$ with an interaction-dependent exponent $\\nu$. The\ndifferent regimes can be detected in the nonequilibrium expansion dynamics of\nan initially confined impurity.\n", "  There are very strong observed correlations between the specific\nstar-formation rates (sSFR) of galaxies and their mean surface mass densities,\n{\\Sigma}, as well as other aspects of their internal structure. These strong\ncorrelations have often been taken to indicate that the internal structure of a\ngalaxy must play a major physical role, directly or indirectly, in the control\nof star-formation. In this paper we show by means of a very simple toy model\nthat these correlations can arise naturally without any such physical role once\nthe observed evolution of the size-mass relation for star-forming galaxies is\ntaken into account. In particular, the model reproduces the sharp threshold in\n{\\Sigma} between galaxies that are star-forming and those that are quenched,\nand the evolution of this threshold with redshift. Similarly, it produces\niso-quenched-fraction contours in the ${f_Q(m,R_e)}$ plane that are almost\nexactly parallel to lines of constant {\\Sigma} for centrals and shallower for\nsatellites. It does so without any dependence on quenching on size or {\\Sigma},\nand without invoking any differences between centrals and satellites, beyond\nthe different mass-dependences of their quenching laws. The toy-model also\nreproduces several other observations, including the sSFR gradients within\ngalaxies and the appearance of inside-out build-up of passive galaxies.\nFinally, it is shown that curvature in the Main Sequence sSFR-mass relation can\nproduce curvature in the apparent B/T ratios with mass. Our analysis therefore\nsuggests that many of the strong correlations that are observed between galaxy\nstructure and sSFR may well be a consequence of things unrelated to quenching\nand should not be taken as evidence of the physical processes that drive\nquenching.\n", "  We study composite fermi liquid (CFL) states in the lowest Landau level (LLL)\nlimit at a generic filling $\\nu = \\frac{1}{n}$. We begin with the old\nobservation that, in compressible states, the composite fermion in the lowest\nLandau level should be viewed as a charge-neutral particle carrying vorticity.\nThis leads to the absence of a Chern-Simons term in the effective theory of the\nCFL. We argue here that instead a Berry curvature should be enclosed by the\nfermi surface of composite fermions, with the total Berry phase fixed by the\nfilling fraction $\\phi_B=-2\\pi\\nu$. We illustrate this point with the CFL of\nfermions at filling fractions $\\nu=1/2q$ and (single and two-component) bosons\nat $\\nu=1/(2q+1)$. The Berry phase leads to sharp consequences in the transport\nproperties including thermal and spin Hall conductances, which in the RPA\napproximation are distinct from the standard Halperin-Lee-Read predictions. We\nemphasize that these results only rely on the LLL limit, and do not require\nparticle-hole symmetry, which is present microscopically only for fermions at\n$\\nu=1/2$. Nevertheless, we show that the existing LLL theory of the composite\nfermi liquid for bosons at $\\nu=1$ does have an emergent particle-hole\nsymmetry. We interpret this particle-hole symmetry as a transformation between\nthe empty state at $\\nu=0$ and the boson integer quantum hall state at $\\nu=2$.\nThis understanding enables us to define particle-hole conjugates of various\nbosonic quantum Hall states which we illustrate with the bosonic Jain and\nPfaffian states. The bosonic particle-hole symmetry can be realized exactly on\nthe surface of a three-dimensional boson topological insulator. We also show\nthat with the particle-hole and spin $SU(2)$ rotation symmetries, there is no\ngapped topological phase for bosons at $\\nu=1$.\n", "  We investigate experimentally the dynamical relaxation of a non-integrable\nquantum many-body system to its equilibrium state. A Bose-Einstein condensate\nis loaded into the first excited band of an optical lattice and let to evolve\nup to a few hundreds of milliseconds. Signs of quantum equilibration are\nobserved. There is a period of time, roughly 40 ms long, during which both the\naspect ratio of the cloud and its momentum distribution remain constant. In\nparticular, the momentum distribution has a flat top and is not a Gaussian\nthermal distribution. After this period, the cloud becomes classical as its\nmomentum distribution becomes Gaussian.\n", "  Violation of the action-reaction principle is shown to occur in the van der\nWaals interaction between two atoms, one of which is excited. It is accompanied\nby the transfer of linear momentum to the electromagnetic vacuum. The vacuum\nmomentum results from the asymmetric interference of the virtual photons\nscattered off each atom along the interatomic direction, which is in itself a\nmanifestation of the optical theorem. This momentum, of equal strength and\nopposite direction to the momentum gained by the two-atom system, is ultimately\nreleased through directional spontaneous emission. A quantitative prediction of\nthis phenomenon is made in a two-alkali atom system. It is conjectured that\naction-reaction violation takes place in any asymmetrically excited system.\n", "  This paper presents a full simulation study of the measurement of the\nproduction cross section ($\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ZH}}$) of the Higgsstrahlung process\n$\\mathrm{e^{+}e^{-}\\rightarrow ZH}$ and the Higgs boson mass ($M_{\\mathrm{H}}$)\nat the International Linear Collider (ILC), using events in which a Higgs boson\nrecoils against a Z boson decaying into a pair of muons or electrons. The\nanalysis is carried out for three center-of-mass energies $\\sqrt{s}$ = 250,\n350, and 500 GeV, and two beam polarizations $\\mathrm{e_{L}^{-}e_{R}^{+}}$ and\n$\\mathrm{e_{R}^{-}e_{L}^{+}}$, for which the polarizations of $\\mathrm{e^{-}}$\nand $\\mathrm{e^{+}}$ are $\\left(P\\mathrm{e^{-}},P\\mathrm{e^{+}}\\right)$\n=($-$80\\%, +30\\%) and (+80\\%, $-$30\\%), respectively. Assuming an integrated\nluminosity of 250 $\\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$ for each beam polarization at $\\sqrt{s}$ =\n250 GeV, where the best lepton momentum resolution is obtainable,\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ZH}}$ and $M_{\\mathrm{H}}$ can be determined with a precision\nof 2.5\\% and 37 MeV for $\\mathrm{e_{L}^{-}e_{R}^{+}}$ and 2.9\\% and 41 MeV for\n$\\mathrm{e_{R}^{-}e_{L}^{+}}$, respectively. Regarding a 20 year ILC physics\nprogram, the expected precisions for the $\\mathrm{HZZ}$ coupling and\n$M_{\\mathrm{H}}$ are estimated to be 0.4\\% and 14 MeV, respectively. The event\nselection is designed to optimize the precisions of $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ZH}}$ and\n$M_{\\mathrm{H}}$ while minimizing the bias on the measured\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ZH}}$ due to discrepancy in signal efficiencies among Higgs\ndecay modes. For the first time, model independence has been demonstrated to a\nsub-percent level for the $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{ZH}}$ measurement at each of the\nthree center-of-mass energies. The results presented show the impact of\ncenter-of-mass energy and beam polarization on the evaluated precisons and\nserve as a benchmark for the planning of the ILC run scenario.\n", "  Spectral line intensity mapping has been proposed as a promising tool to\nefficiently probe the cosmic reionization and the large-scale structure.\nWithout detecting individual sources, line intensity mapping makes use of all\navailable photons and measures the integrated light in the source confusion\nlimit, to efficiently map the three-dimensional matter distribution on large\nscales as traced by a given emission line. One particular challenge is the\nseparation of desired signals from astrophysical continuum foregrounds and line\ninterlopers. Here we present a technique to extract large-scale structure\ninformation traced by emission lines from different redshifts, embedded in a\nthree-dimensional intensity mapping data cube. The line redshifts are\ndistinguished by the anisotropic shape of the power spectra when projected onto\na common coordinate frame. We consider the case where high-redshift [CII] lines\nare confused with multiple low-redshift CO rotational lines. We present a\nsemi-analytic model for [CII] and CO line estimates based on the cosmic\ninfrared background measurements, and show that with a modest instrumental\nnoise level and survey geometry, the large-scale [CII] and CO power spectrum\namplitudes can be successfully extracted from a confusion-limited data set,\nwithout external information. We discuss the implications and limits of this\ntechnique for possible line intensity mapping experiments.\n", "  Cosmic reionization is thought to be primarily fueled by the first\ngenerations of galaxies. We examine their stellar and gaseous properties,\nfocusing on the star formation rates and the escape of ionizing photons, as a\nfunction of halo mass, redshift, and environment using the full suite of the\n{\\it Renaissance Simulations} with an eye to provide better inputs to global\nreionization simulations. This suite, carried out with the adaptive mesh\nrefinement code Enzo, is unprecedented in terms of their size and physical\ningredients. The simulations probe overdense, average, and underdense regions\nof the universe of several hundred comoving Mpc$^3$, each yielding a sample of\nover 3,000 halos in the mass range $10^7 - 10^{9.5}~\\Ms$ at their final\nredshifts of 15, 12.5, and 8, respectively. In the process, we simulate the\neffects of radiative and supernova feedback from 5,000 to 10,000 metal-free\n(Population III) stars in each simulation. We find that halos as small as\n$10^7~\\Ms$ are able to form stars due to metal-line cooling from earlier\nenrichment by massive Population III stars. However, we find such halos do not\nform stars continuously. Using our large sample, we find that the galaxy-halo\noccupation fraction drops from unity at virial masses above $10^{8.5}~\\Ms$ to\n$\\sim$50\\% at $10^8 ~\\Ms$ and $\\sim$10\\% at $10^7~\\Ms$, quite independent of\nredshift and region. Their average ionizing escape fraction is $\\sim$5\\% in the\nmass range $10^8 - 10^9~\\Ms$ and increases with decreasing halo mass below this\nrange, reaching 40--60\\% at $10^7~\\Ms$. Interestingly, we find that the escape\nfraction varies between 10--20\\% in halos with virial masses $\\sim 3 \\times\n10^9~\\Ms$. Taken together, our results confirm the importance of the smallest\ngalaxies as sources of ionizing radiation contributing to the reionization of\nthe universe.\n", "  Atom interferometers are a useful tool for precision measurements of\nfundamental physical phenomena, ranging from local gravitational field strength\nto the atomic fine structure constant. In such experiments, it is desirable to\nimplement a high momentum transfer \"beam-splitter,\" which may be achieved by\ninducing quantum resonance in a finite-temperature laser-driven atomic gas. We\nuse Monte Carlo simulations to investigate these quantum resonances in the\nregime where the gas receives laser pulses of finite duration, and demonstrate\nthat an $\\epsilon$-classical model for the dynamics of the gas atoms is capable\nof reproducing quantum resonant behavior for both zero-temperature and\nfinite-temperature non-interacting gases. We show that this model agrees well\nwith the fully quantum treatment of the system over a time-scale set by the\nchoice of experimental parameters. We also show that this model is capable of\ncorrectly treating the time-reversal mechanism necessary for implementing an\ninterferometer with this physical configuration.\n", "  We report the observation of a distinct correlation between the kinetic\nfragility index $m$ and the reduced Arrhenius crossover temperature $\\theta_A =\nT_A/T_g$ in various glass-forming liquids, identifying three distinguishable\ngroups. In particular, for 11 glass-forming metallic liquids, we universally\nobserve a crossover in the mean diffusion coefficient from high-temperature\nArrhenius to low-temperature super-Arrhenius behavior at approximately\n$\\theta_A \\approx 2$ which is in the stable liquid phases. In contrast, for\nfragile molecular liquids, this crossover occurs at much lower $\\theta_A\n\\approx 1.4$ and usually in their supercooled states. The $\\theta_A$ values for\nstrong network liquids spans a wide range higher than 2. Intriguingly, the\nhigh-temperature activation barrier $E_\\infty$ is universally found to be $\\sim\n11\\ k_B T_g$ and uncorrelated with the fragility or the reduced crossover\ntemperature $\\theta_A$ for metallic and molecular liquids. These observations\nprovide a way to estimate the low-temperature glassy characteristics ($T_g$ and\n$m$) from the high-temperature liquid quantities ($E_\\infty$ and $\\theta_A$).\n", "  We investigate the ultraharmonics response of a protoplanetary disk to an\norbiting planet. We find that the multi-armed spiral structure can be excited\nby the higher-order forcing due to nonlinear mode-coupling. In particular, the\npreferential excitation of gas response with small azimuthal wavenumber $(m\\sim\n2)$ is a direct consequence of mode-coupling among linear waves. The presence\nof multiple Fourier components in a planet's potential is a distinct feature\ncompared to the previous studies in the context of spiral galaxies, which turns\nout to be crucial for the generation of ultraharmonics waves. This analysis may\nshed light on understanding some results regarding the spiral structures\nexcited by a massive planet.\n", "  The stress tensor is a basic local operator in any field theory; in the\ncontext of AdS/CFT, it is the operator which is dual to the bulk geometry\nitself. Here we exploit this feature by using the bulk geometry to place\nconstraints on the local energy density in static states of holographic\n$(2+1)$-dimensional CFTs living on a closed (but otherwise generally curved)\nspatial geometry. We allow for the presence of a marginal scalar deformation,\ndual to a massless scalar field in the bulk. For certain vacuum states in which\nthe bulk geometry is well-behaved at zero temperature, we find that the bulk\nequations of motion imply that the local energy density integrated over\nspecific boundary domains is negative. In the absence of scalar deformations,\nwe use the inverse mean curvature flow to show that if the CFT spatial geometry\nhas spherical topology but non-constant curvature, the local energy density\nmust be positive somewhere. This result extends to other topologies, but only\nfor certain types of vacuum; in particular, for a generic toroidal boundary,\nthe vacuum's bulk dual must be the zero-temperature limit of a toroidal black\nhole.\n", "  The existence of potentials for relativistic Schrodinger operators allowing\neigenvalues embedded in the essential spectrum is a long-standing open problem.\nWe construct Neumann-Wigner type potentials for the massive relativistic\nSchrodinger operator in one and three dimensions for which an embedded\neigenvalue exists. We show that in the non-relativistic limit these potentials\nconverge to the classical Neumann-Wigner and Moses-Tuan potentials,\nrespectively. For the massless operator in one dimension we construct two\nfamilies of potentials, different by the parities of the (generalized)\neigenfunctions, for which an eigenvalue equal to zero or a zero-resonance\nexists, dependent on the rate of decay of the corresponding eigenfunctions. We\nobtain explicit formulae and observe unusual decay behaviours due to the\nnon-locality of the operator.\n", "  We study the fate of algebraic decay of correlations in a harmonically\ntrapped two-dimensional degenerate Bose gas. The analysis is inspired by recent\nexperiments on ultracold atoms where power-law correlations have been observed\ndespite the presence of the external potential. We generalize the spin wave\ndescription of phase fluctuations to the trapped case and obtain an analytical\nexpression for the one-body density matrix within this approximation. We show\nthat algebraic decay of the central correlation function persists to lengths of\nabout 20% of the Thomas--Fermi radius. We establish that the trap-averaged\ncorrelation function decays algebraically with a strictly larger exponent\nweakly changing with trap size and find indications that the recently observed\nenhanced scaling exponents receive significant contributions from the normal\ncomponent of the gas. We discuss radial and angular correlations and propose a\nlocal correlation approximation which captures the correlations very well. Our\nanalysis goes beyond the usual local density approximation and the developed\nsummation techniques constitute a powerful tool to investigate correlations in\ninhomogeneous systems.\n", "  We present maps of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds from combined South\nPole Telescope (SPT) and Planck data. The Planck satellite observes in nine\nbands, while the SPT data used in this work were taken with the three-band\nSPT-SZ camera, The SPT-SZ bands correspond closely to three of the nine Planck\nbands, namely those centered at 1.4, 2.1, and 3.0 mm. The angular resolution of\nthe Planck data ranges from 5 to 10 arcmin, while the SPT resolution ranges\nfrom 1.0 to 1.7 arcmin. The combined maps take advantage of the high resolution\nof the SPT data and the long-timescale stability of the space-based Planck\nobservations to deliver robust brightness measurements on scales from the size\nof the maps down to ~1 arcmin. In each band, we first calibrate and\ncolor-correct the SPT data to match the Planck data, then we use noise\nestimates from each instrument and knowledge of each instrument's beam to make\nthe inverse-variance-weighted combination of the two instruments' data as a\nfunction of angular scale. We create maps assuming a range of underlying\nemission spectra and at a range of final resolutions. We perform several\nconsistency tests on the combined maps and estimate the expected noise in\nmeasurements of features in the maps. We compare maps from this work to maps\nfrom the Herschel HERITAGE survey, finding general consistency between the\ndatasets. All data products described in this paper are available for download\nfrom the NASA Legacy Archive for Microwave Background Data Analysis server.\n", "  The scaling relations and the star formation laws for molecular cloud\ncomplexes in the Milky Way is investigated. We compare their masses $M_{\\rm\ngas}$, mass surface densities $\\Sigma_{M_{\\rm gas}}$, radii $R$, velocity\ndispersions $\\sigma$, star formation rates $SFR$, and SFR densities\n$\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$ with those of structures ranging from cores, clumps, Giant\nMolecular Clouds (GMCs), to Molecular Cloud Complexes (MCCs), and to Galaxies,\nspanning 8 orders of magnitudes in size and 13 orders of magnitudes in mass.\nMCC are mostly large ($R>50$ pc), massive ($\\sim 10^{6}$\\,\\msun)\ngravitationally unbound cloud structures. This results in the following\nuniversal relations:\n  $\\sigma\\sim R^{0.5}$, $M_{\\rm gas}\\sim R^{2}$, $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}\\sim\n\\Sigma_{M_{\\rm gas}}^{1.5}$, ${SFR}\\sim {M_{\\rm gas}}^{0.9}$, and ${SFR}\\sim\n{\\sigma}^{2.7}$.\n  Variations in the slopes and the coefficients of these relations are found at\nindividual scales signifying different physics acting at different scales.\nAdditionally, there are breaks at the MCC scale in the $\\sigma-R$ relation and\nbetween the starburst and the normal star-forming objects in the $SFR-M_{\\rm\ngas}$ and $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$-$\\Sigma_{\\rm M_{\\rm gas}}$ relations. We propose\nto use the Schmidt-Kennicutt diagram to distinguish the starburst from the\nnormal star-forming structures by applying a $\\Sigma_{M_{\\rm gas}}$ threshold\nof $\\sim100$\\,\\msun pc$^{-2}$ and a $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$ threshold of 1\\,\\msun\nyr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$. Mini-starburst complexes have enhanced $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$\n($>$1\\,\\msun yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$), probably caused by dynamic events such as\nradiation pressure, colliding flows, or spiral arm gravitational instability.\nBecause of the dynamical evolution, gravitational boundedness does not play a\nsignificant role in characterizing the star formation activity of MCCs,\nespecially the mini-starburst complexes.\n", "  We have performed micromagnetic simulations of the vortex gyrotropic mode\nresonance in a range of disk geometries subject to spatially uniform\nout-of-plane magnetic fields. For disks of small lateral dimensions, we observe\na drop-off in the mode's frequency for field amplitudes approaching the disk\nsaturation field. This non-linear frequency response is shown to be associated\nwith an increased vortex core deformation, which results from the demagnetizing\nfield created when the core is shifted laterally. Such deformation results in\nan increase in the average out-of-plane magnetization of the displaced vortex\nstate, which through an exchange contribution, leads to a sharp decrease in the\nvortex stiffness coefficient. It is this decrease in the vortex stiffness\ncoefficient which leads to the non-linear field dependence of the gyrotropic\nmode frequency.\n", "  We present a simplified model for dynamical diffraction of particles through\na periodic thick perfect crystal based on repeated application of a coherent\nbeam splitting unitary at coarse-grained lattice sites. By demanding\ntranslational invariance and a computationally tractable number of sites in the\ncoarse-graining we show how this approach reproduces many results typical of\ndynamical diffraction theory and experiments. This approach has the benefit of\nbeing applicable in the thick, thin, and intermediate crystal regimes. The\nmethod is applied to a three-blade neutron interferometer to predict the output\nbeam profiles, interference patterns, and contrast variation.\n", "  This paper describes the identification, modelling, and removal of previously\nunexplained systematic effects in the polarization data of the Planck High\nFrequency Instrument (HFI) on large angular scales, including new mapmaking and\ncalibration procedures, new and more complete end-to-end simulations, and a set\nof robust internal consistency checks on the resulting maps. These maps, at\n100, 143, 217, and 353 GHz, are early versions of those that will be released\nin final form later in 2016.\n  The improvements allow us to determine the cosmic reionization optical depth\n$\\tau$ using, for the first time, the low-multipole $EE$ data from HFI,\nreducing significantly the central value and uncertainty, and hence the upper\nlimit. Two different likelihood procedures are used to constrain $\\tau$ from\ntwo estimators of the CMB $E$- and $B$-mode angular power spectra at 100 and\n143 GHz, after debiasing the spectra from a small remaining systematic\ncontamination. These all give fully consistent results.\n  A further consistency test is performed using cross-correlations derived from\nthe Low Frequency Instrument maps of the Planck 2015 data release and the new\nHFI data. For this purpose, end-to-end analyses of systematic effects from the\ntwo instruments are used to demonstrate the near independence of their dominant\nsystematic error residuals.\n  The tightest result comes from the HFI-based $\\tau$ posterior distribution\nusing the maximum likelihood power spectrum estimator from $EE$ data only,\ngiving a value $0.055\\pm 0.009$. In a companion paper these results are\ndiscussed in the context of the best-fit Planck $\\Lambda$CDM cosmological model\nand recent models of reionization.\n", "  The physical properties of galactic winds are one of the keys to understand\ngalaxy formation and evolution. These properties can be constrained thanks to\nbackground quasar lines of sight (LOS) passing near star-forming galaxies\n(SFGs). We present the first results of the MusE GAs FLOw and Wind (MEGAFLOW)\nsurvey obtained of 2 quasar fields which have 8 MgII absorbers of which 3 have\nrest-equivalent width greater than 0.8 \\AA. With the new Multi Unit\nSpectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope (VLT),\nwe detect 6 (75$\\%$) MgII host galaxy candidates withing a radius of 30 arcsec\nfrom the quasar LOS. Out of these 6 galaxy--quasar pairs, from geometrical\narguments, one is likely probing galactic outflows, two are classified as\n\"ambiguous\", two are likely probing extended gaseous disks and one pair seems\nto be a merger. We focus on the wind$-$pair and constrain the outflow using a\nhigh resolution quasar spectra from Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph\n(UVES). Assuming the metal absorption to be due to gas flowing out of the\ndetected galaxy through a cone along the minor axis, we find outflow velocities\nof the order of $\\approx$ 150 km/s (i.e. smaller than the escape velocity) with\na loading factor, $\\eta =\\dot M_{\\rm out}/$SFR, of $\\approx$ 0.7. We see\nevidence for an open conical flow, with a low-density inner core. In the\nfuture, MUSE will provide us with about 80 multiple galaxy$-$quasar pairs in\ntwo dozen fields.\n", "  We consider the competition of two mechanisms for adoption processes: a\nso-called complex threshold dynamics and a simple\nSusceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model. Separately, these mechanisms\nlead, respectively, to first order and continuous transitions between\nnon-adoption and adoption phases. We consider two interconnected layers. While\nall nodes on the first layer follow the complex adoption process, all nodes on\nthe second layer follow the simple adoption process. Coupling between the two\nadoption processes occurs as a result of the inclusion of some additional\ninterconnections between layers. We find that the transition points and also\nthe nature of the transitions are modified in the coupled dynamics. In the\ncomplex adoption layer, the critical threshold required for extension of\nadoption increases with interlayer connectivity whereas in the case of an\nisolated single network it would decrease with average connectivity. In\naddition, the transition can become continuous depending on the detailed inter\nand intralayer connectivities. In the SIS layer, any interlayer connectivity\nleads to the extension of the adopter phase. Besides, a new transition appears\nas as sudden drop of the fraction of adopters in the SIS layer. The main\nnumerical findings are described by a mean-field type analytical approach\nappropriately developed for the threshold-SIS coupled system.\n", "  We investigate constraints on cosmic reionization extracted from the Planck\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) data. We combine the Planck CMB anisotropy\ndata in temperature with the low-multipole polarization data to fit LCDM models\nwith various parameterizations of the reionization history. We obtain a Thomson\noptical depth tau=0.058 +/- 0.012 for the commonly adopted instantaneous\nreionization model. This confirms, with only data from CMB anisotropies, the\nlow value suggested by combining Planck 2015 results with other data sets and\nalso reduces the uncertainties. We reconstruct the history of the ionization\nfraction using either a symmetric or an asymmetric model for the transition\nbetween the neutral and ionized phases. To determine better constraints on the\nduration of the reionization process, we also make use of measurements of the\namplitude of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect using additional\ninformation from the high resolution Atacama Cosmology Telescope and South Pole\nTelescope experiments. The average redshift at which reionization occurs is\nfound to lie between z=7.8 and 8.8, depending on the model of reionization\nadopted. Using kSZ constraints and a redshift-symmetric reionization model, we\nfind an upper limit to the width of the reionization period of Dz < 2.8. In all\ncases, we find that the Universe is ionized at less than the 10% level at\nredshifts above z~10. This suggests that an early onset of reionization is\nstrongly disfavoured by the Planck data. We show that this result also reduces\nthe tension between CMB-based analyses and constraints from other astrophysical\nsources.\n", "  We use numerical simulations to examine the effects of radial migration on\nthe vertical structure of galaxy disks. The simulations follow three\nexponential disks of different mass but similar circular velocity, radial\nscalelength, and (constant) scale height. The disks develop different\nnon-axisymmetric patterns, ranging from feeble, long-lived multiple arms to\nstrong, rapidly-evolving few-armed spirals. These fluctuations induce radial\nmigration through secular changes in the angular momentum of disk particles,\nmixing the disk radially and blurring pre-existing gradients. Migration affects\nprimarily stars with small vertical excursions, regardless of spiral pattern.\nThis \"provenance bias\" largely determines the vertical structure of migrating\nstars: inward migrators thin down as they move in, whereas outward migrators do\nnot thicken up but rather preserve the disk scale height at destination.\nMigrators of equal birth radius thus develop a strong scale-height gradient,\nnot by flaring out as commonly assumed, but by thinning down as they spread\ninward. Similar gradients have been observed for low-[$\\alpha$/Fe]\nmono-abundance populations (MAPs) in the Galaxy but our results argue against\ninterpreting them as a consequence of radial migration. This is because outward\nmigration does not lead to thickening, implying that the maximum scale height\nof any population should reflect its value at birth. In contrast, Galactic MAPs\nhave scale heights that increase monotonically outwards, reaching values that\ngreatly exceed those at their presumed birth radii. Given the strong vertical\nbias affecting migration, a proper assessment of the importance of radial\nmigration in the Galaxy should take carefully into account the strong radial\ndependence of the scale heights of the various stellar populations.\n", "  The increasing number and precision of measurements of neutron star masses,\nradii, and, in the near future, moments of inertia offer the possibility of\nprecisely determining the neutron star equation of state. One way to facilitate\nthe mapping of observables to the equation of state is through a\nparametrization of the latter. We present here a generic method for optimizing\nthe parametrization of any physically allowed EoS. We use mock equations of\nstate that incorporate physically diverse and extreme behavior to test how well\nour parametrization reproduces the global properties of the stars, by\nminimizing the errors in the observables mass, radius, and the moment of\ninertia. We find that using piecewise polytropes and sampling the EoS with five\nfiducial densities between ~1-8 times the nuclear saturation density results in\noptimal errors for the smallest number of parameters. Specifically, it\nrecreates the radii of the assumed EoS to within less than 0.5 km for the\nextreme mock equations of state and to within less than 0.12 km for 95% of a\nsample of 42 proposed, physically-motivated equations of state. Such a\nparametrization is also able to reproduce the maximum mass to within 0.04 M_sun\nand the moment of inertia of a 1.338 M_sun neutron star to within less than 10%\nfor 95% of the proposed sample of equations of state.\n", "  A search for squarks and gluinos in final states containing hadronic jets,\nmissing transverse momentum but no electrons or muons is presented. The data\nwere recorded in 2015 by the ATLAS experiment in $\\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV\nproton--proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. No excess above the\nStandard Model background expectation was observed in 3.2 fb$^{-1}$ of analyzed\ndata. Results are interpreted within simplified models that assume R-parity is\nconserved and the neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle. An\nexclusion limit at the 95% confidence level on the mass of the gluino is set at\n1.51 TeV for a simplified model incorporating only a gluino octet and the\nlightest neutralino, assuming the lightest neutralino is massless. For a\nsimplified model involving the strong production of mass-degenerate first- and\nsecond-generation squarks, squark masses below 1.03 TeV are excluded for a\nmassless lightest neutralino. These limits substantially extend the region of\nsupersymmetric parameter space excluded by previous measurements with the ATLAS\ndetector.\n", "  The dependence of gas giant planet occurrence rate on stellar metallicity has\nbeen firmly established. We extend this so-called planet-metallicity\ncorrelation to broader ranges of metallicities and planet masses/radii. In\nparticular, we assume that the planet-metallicity correlation is a power law\nbelow some critical saturation threshold, and that the probability of hosting\nat least one planet is unity for stars with metallicity above the threshold. We\nthen are able to explain the discrepancy between the tentative detection and\nnull detection in previous studies regarding the planet-metallicity correlation\nfor small planets. In particular, we find that the null detection of this\ncorrelation can be attributed to the combination of high planet occurrence rate\nand low detection efficiency. Therefore, a planet-metallicity correlation for\nsmall planets cannot be ruled out. We propose that stars with metallicities\nlower than the Solar value are better targets for testing the\nplanet-metallicity correlation for small planets.\n", "  We investigate the critical endline of the finite temperature phase\ntransition of QCD around the SU(3)-flavor symmetric point at zero chemical\npotential. We employ the renormalization-group improved Iwasaki gauge action\nand non-perturbatively $O(a)$-improved Wilson-clover fermion action. The\ncritical endline is determined by using the intersection point of kurtosis,\nemploying the multi-parameter, multi-ensemble reweighting method to calculate\nobservables off the SU(3)-symmetric point, at the temporal size $N_{\\rm T}$=6\nand lattice spacing as low as $a \\approx 0.19$ fm. We confirm that the slope of\nthe critical endline takes the value of $-2$, and find that the second\nderivative is positive, at the SU(3)-flavor symmetric point on the Columbia\nplot parametrized with the strange quark mass $m_s$ and degenerated up-down\nquark mass $m_{\\rm l}$.\n", "  Persisting tensions between the cosmological constraints derived from\nlow-redshift probes and the ones obtained from temperature and polarisation\nanisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background -- although not yet providing\ncompelling evidence against the $\\Lambda $CDM model -- seem to consistently\nindicate a slower growth of density perturbations as compared to the\npredictions of the standard cosmological scenario. Such behavior is not easily\naccommodated by the simplest extensions of General Relativity, such as f(R)\nmodels, which generically predict an enhanced growth rate. In the present work\nwe present the outcomes of a suite of large N-body simulations carried out in\nthe context of a cosmological model featuring a non-vanishing scattering cross\nsection between the dark matter and the dark energy fields, for two different\nparameterisations of the dark energy equation of state. Our results indicate\nthat these Dark Scattering models have very mild effects on many observables\nrelated to large-scale structures formation and evolution, while providing a\nsignificant suppression of the amplitude of linear density perturbations and\nthe abundance of massive clusters. Our simulations therefore confirm that these\nmodels offer a promising route to alleviate existing tensions between\nlow-redshift measurements and those of the CMB.\n", "  We describe a new open source package for calculating properties of galaxy\nclusters, including NFW halo profiles with and without the effects of cluster\nmiscentering. This pure-Python package, cluster-lensing, provides\nwell-documented and easy-to-use classes and functions for calculating cluster\nscaling relations, including mass-richness and mass-concentration relations\nfrom the literature, as well as the surface mass density $\\Sigma(R)$ and\ndifferential surface mass density $\\Delta\\Sigma(R)$ profiles, probed by weak\nlensing magnification and shear. Galaxy cluster miscentering is especially a\nconcern for stacked weak lensing shear studies of galaxy clusters, where\noffsets between the assumed and the true underlying matter distribution can\nlead to a significant bias in the mass estimates if not accounted for. This\nsoftware has been developed and released in a public GitHub repository, and is\nlicensed under the permissive MIT license. The cluster-lensing package is\narchived on Zenodo (Ford 2016). Full documentation, source code, and\ninstallation instructions are available at\nhttp://jesford.github.io/cluster-lensing/.\n", "  The determination of galaxy redshifts in James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)'s\nblank-field surveys will mostly rely on photometric estimates, based on the\ndata provided by JWST's Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) at 0.6-5.0 {\\mu}m and Mid\nInfrared Instrument (MIRI) at {\\lambda}>5.0 {\\mu}m. In this work we analyse the\nimpact of choosing different combinations of NIRCam and MIRI broad-band filters\n(F070W to F770W), as well as having ancillary data at {\\lambda}<0.6 {\\mu}m, on\nthe derived photometric redshifts (zphot) of a total of 5921 real and simulated\ngalaxies, with known input redshifts z=0-10. We found that observations at\n{\\lambda}<0.6 {\\mu}m are necessary to control the contamination of high-z\nsamples by low-z interlopers. Adding MIRI (F560W and F770W) photometry to the\nNIRCam data mitigates the absence of ancillary observations at {\\lambda}<0.6\n{\\mu}m and improves the redshift estimation. At z=7-10, accurate zphot can be\nobtained with the NIRCam broad bands alone when S/N>=10, but the zphot quality\nsignificantly degrades at S/N<=5. Adding MIRI photometry with one magnitude\nbrighter depth than the NIRCam depth allows for a redshift recovery of 83-99%,\ndepending on SED type, and its effect is particularly noteworthy for galaxies\nwith nebular emission. The vast majority of NIRCam galaxies with [F150W]=29 AB\nmag at z=7-10 will be detected with MIRI at [F560W, F770W]<28 mag if these\nsources are at least mildly evolved or have spectra with emission lines\nboosting the mid-infrared fluxes.\n", "  Conventional supersymmetry searches rely on large missing momentum and, on\nthat account, are unsuitable for discovering superpartners nearly degenerate\nwith the LSP. Such \"compressed regions\" are best probed by dedicated strategies\nthat exploit their unique kinematic features. We consider a case study of a\ncompressed gluino-bino simplified spectrum, motivated by its ability to set the\ndark matter relic abundance via co-annihilation. A kinematic variable suited to\nthis spectrum is introduced, by which, for a gluino-bino mass splitting of 100\nGeV, the discovery reach is extendable to m(gluino) = 850 GeV (1370 GeV) at LHC\ncenter-of-mass energy 8 TeV (13 TeV) with luminosity 20 inverse fb (3000\ninverse fb). The non-trivial role played by soft triggers is also discussed.\n", "  We study the preferred environments of $z \\sim 0$ massive relic galaxies\n($M_\\star \\gtrsim 10^{10}~\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ galaxies with little or no growth\nfrom star formation or mergers since $z \\sim 2$). Significantly, we carry out\nour analysis on both a large cosmological simulation and an observed galaxy\ncatalogue.\n  Working on the Millennium I-WMAP7 simulation we show that the fraction of\ntoday massive objects which have grown less than 10 per cent in mass since $z\n\\sim 2$ is ~0.04 per cent for the whole massive galaxy population with $M_\\star\n> 10^{10}~\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$. This fraction rises to ~0.18 per cent in galaxy\nclusters, confirming that clusters help massive galaxies remain unaltered.\nSimulations also show that massive relic galaxies tend to be closer to cluster\ncentres than other massive galaxies.\n  Using the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalogue, and defining\nrelics as $M_\\star \\gtrsim 10^{10}~\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ early-type galaxies with\ncolours compatible with single-stellar population ages older than 10 Gyr, and\nwhich occupy the bottom 5-percentile in the stellar mass-size distribution, we\nfind $1.11 \\pm 0.05$ per cent of relics among massive galaxies. This fraction\nrises to $2.4 \\pm 0.4$ per cent in high-density environments.\n  Our findings point in the same direction as the works by Poggianti et al. and\nStringer et al. Our results may reflect the fact that the cores of the clusters\nare created very early on, hence the centres host the first cluster members.\nNear the centres, high-velocity dispersions and harassment help cluster core\nmembers avoid the growth of an accreted stellar envelope via mergers, while a\nhot intracluster medium prevents cold gas from reaching the galaxies,\ninhibiting star formation.\n", "  The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) is designed to make high angular\nresolution measurements of anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) at millimeter wavelengths. We describe ACTPol, an upgraded receiver for\nACT, which uses feedhorn-coupled, polarization-sensitive detector arrays, a 3\ndegree field of view, 100 mK cryogenics with continuous cooling, and meta\nmaterial anti-reflection coatings. ACTPol comprises three arrays with separate\ncryogenic optics: two arrays at a central frequency of 148 GHz and one array\noperating simultaneously at both 97 GHz and 148 GHz. The combined instrument\nsensitivity, angular resolution, and sky coverage are optimized for measuring\nangular power spectra, clusters via the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and kinetic\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich signals, and CMB lensing due to large scale structure. The\nreceiver was commissioned with its first 148 GHz array in 2013, observed with\nboth 148 GHz arrays in 2014, and has recently completed its first full season\nof operations with the full suite of three arrays. This paper provides an\noverview of the design and initial performance of the receiver and related\nsystems.\n", "  Using the power of gravitational lensing magnification by massive galaxy\nclusters, the Hubble Frontier Fields provide deep views of six patches of the\nhigh redshift Universe. The combination of deep Hubble imaging and exceptional\nlensing strength has revealed the greatest numbers of multiply-imaged galaxies\navailable to constrain models of cluster mass distributions. However, even with\n$\\mathcal{O}(100)$ images per cluster, the uncertainties associated with the\nreconstructions are not negligible. The goal of this paper is to show the\ndiversity of model magnification predictions. We examine 7 and 9 mass models of\nAbell 2744 and MACS J0416, respectively, submitted to the Mikulski Archive for\nSpace Telescopes for public distribution in September 2015. The dispersion\nbetween model predictions increases from 30% at common low magnifications\n($\\mu\\sim2$) to 70% at rare high magnifications ($\\mu\\sim40$). MACS J0416\nexhibits smaller dispersions than Abell 2744 for $2<\\mu<10$. We show that\nmagnification maps based on different lens inversion techniques typically\ndiffer from each other by more than their quoted statistical errors. This\nsuggests that some models underestimate the true uncertainties, which are\nprimarily due to various lensing degeneracies. Though the exact mass sheet\ndegeneracy is broken, its generalized counterpart is not broken at least in\nAbell 2744. Other, local degeneracies are also present in both clusters. Our\ncomparison of models is complementary to the comparison of reconstructions of\nknown synthetic mass distributions. By focusing on observed clusters, we can\nidentify those that are best constrained, and therefore provide the clearest\nview of the distant Universe.\n", "  The $\\mathcal{O}(\\partial^2)$ background independent flow equations for\nconformally reduced gravity are shown to be equivalent to flow equations\nnaturally adapted to scalar field theory with a wrong sign kinetic term. This\nsign change is shown to have a profound effect on the renormalization group\nproperties, broadly resulting in a continuum of fixed points supporting both a\ndiscrete and a continuous eigenoperator spectrum, the latter always including\nrelevant directions. The properties at the Gaussian fixed point are understood\nin particular depth, but also detailed studies of the local potential\napproximation, and the full $\\mathcal{O}(\\partial^2)$ approximation are given.\nThese results are related to evidence for asymptotic safety found by other\nauthors.\n", "  In this Letter, both the manipulation of valley-polarized currents and the\noptical-like behaviors of Dirac fermions are theoretically explored in\npolycrystalline graphene. When strain is applied, the misorientation between\ntwo graphene domains separated by a grain boundary can result in a mismatch of\ntheir electronic structures. Such a discrepancy manifests itself in a strong\nbreaking of the inversion symmetry, leading to perfect valley polarization in a\nwide range of transmission directions. In addition, these graphene domains act\nas different media for electron waves, offering the possibility to modulate and\nobtain negative refraction indexes.\n", "  We study the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model with an additional\ninversion-symmetry-breaking term. Using the topological Hamiltonian approach,\nwe calculate the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant of the system as function of\nspin-orbit coupling, Hubbard interaction $U$, and inversion-symmetry-breaking\non-site potential. The phase diagram calculated in that way shows that, on the\none hand, a large term of the latter kind destroys the topological non-trivial\nstate. On the other hand, however, this inversion-symmetry-breaking field can\nenhance the topological state, since for moderate values the transition from\nthe non-trivial topological to the trivial Mott insulator is pushed to larger\nvalues of interaction $U$. This feature of an enhanced topological state is\nalso found on honeycomb ribbons. With inversion symmetry, the edge of the\nzigzag ribbon is magnetic for any value of $U$. This magnetic moment destroys\nthe gapless edge mode. Lifting inversion symmetry allows for a finite region in\ninteraction strength $U$ below which gapless edge modes exist.\n", "  We use the coadded spectra of 32 epochs of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\nReverberation Mapping Project observations of 482 quasars with z>1.46 to\nhighlight systematic biases in the SDSS- and BOSS-pipeline redshifts due to the\nnatural diversity of quasar properties. We investigate the characteristics of\nthis bias by comparing the BOSS-pipeline redshifts to an estimate from the\ncentroid of HeII 1640. HeII has a low equivalent width but is often\nwell-defined in high-S/N spectra, does not suffer from self-absorption, and has\na narrow component that, when present (the case for about half of our sources),\nproduces a redshift estimate that, on average, is consistent with that\ndetermined from [OII] to within 1-sigma of the quadrature sum of the HeII and\n[OII] centroid measurement uncertainties. The large redshift differences of\n~1000 km/s, on average, between the BOSS-pipeline and HeII-centroid redshifts\nsuggest there are significant biases in a portion of BOSS quasar redshift\nmeasurements. Adopting the HeII-based redshifts shows that CIV does not exhibit\na ubiquitous blueshift for all quasars, given the precision probed by our\nmeasurements. Instead, we find a distribution of CIV centroid blueshifts across\nour sample, with a dynamic range that (i) is wider than that previously\nreported for this line, and (ii) spans CIV centroids from those consistent with\nthe systemic redshift to those with significant blueshifts of thousands of\nkilometers per second. These results have significant implications for\nmeasurement and use of high-redshift quasar properties and redshifts and\nstudies based thereon.\n", "  Zircon crystals offer a unique combination of suitability for high-precision\nradiometric dating and high resistance to alteration. Paleomagnetic experiments\non ancient zircons may potentially constrain the earliest geodynamo, which\nholds broad implications for the early Earth interior and atmosphere. However,\nthe ability of zircons to record accurately the geomagnetic field has not been\nfully demonstrated. Here we conduct thermal and room temperature alternating\nfield (AF) paleointensity experiments on 767.1 thousand year old (ka) zircons\nfrom the Bishop Tuff, California. The rapid emplacement of these zircons in a\nwell-characterized magnetic field provides a high-fidelity test of the zircons\nintrinsic paleomagnetic recording accuracy. Successful dual heating experiments\non nine zircons measured using a superconducting quantum interference device\n(SQUID) microscope yield a mean paleointensity of 46.2 +/- 18.8 microtesla\n(1sigma), which agrees closely with high-precision results from Bishop Tuff\nwhole rock (43.0 +/- 3.2 microtesla). High-resolution quantum diamond magnetic\nmapping, electron microscopy, and X-ray tomography indicate that the bulk of\nthe remanent magnetization in Bishop Tuff zircons is carried by Fe oxides\nassociated with apatite inclusions, which would be susceptible to destruction\nvia metamorphism and aqueous alteration in older zircons. As such, while\nzircons can reliably record the geomagnetic field, robust zircon-derived\npaleomagnetic results require careful characterization of the ferromagnetic\ncarrier and demonstration of their occurrence in primary inclusions. We further\nconclude that a combination of quantum diamond magnetometry and high-resolution\nimaging can provide detailed, direct characterization of the ferromagnetic\nmineralogy of geological samples.\n", "  We evaluate radiative corrections to the Higgs boson couplings in the inert\ndoublet model, in which the lightest component of the $Z_2^{}$ odd scalar\ndoublet field can be a dark matter candidate. The one-loop contributions to the\n$hVV$, $hff$ and $hhh$ couplings are calculated in the on-shell scheme, where\n$h$ is the Higgs boson with the mass 125 GeV, $V$ represents a weak gauge boson\nand $f$ is a fermion. We investigate how the one-loop corrected Higgs boson\ncouplings can be deviated from the predictions in the standard model under the\nconstraints from perturbative unitarity and vacuum stability in the scenario\nwhere the model can explain current dark matter data. When the mass of the dark\nmatter is slightly above a half of the Higgs boson mass, it would be difficult\nto test the model by the direct search experiments for dark matter. We find\nthat in such a case the model can be tested at future collider experiments by\neither the direct search of heavier inert particles or precision measurements\nof the Higgs boson couplings.\n", "  Parity violating extensions of the standard electromagnetic theory cause in\nvacuo rotation of the plane of polarization of propagating photons. This\neffect, also known as cosmic birefringence, impacts the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) anisotropy angular power spectra, producing non-vanishing\n$T$--$B$ and $E$--$B$ correlations that are otherwise null when parity is a\nsymmetry. Here we present new constraints on an isotropic rotation,\nparametrized by the angle $\\alpha$, derived from Planck 2015 CMB polarization\ndata. To increase the robustness of our analyses, we employ two complementary\napproaches, in harmonic space and in map space, the latter based on a peak\nstacking technique. The two approaches provide estimates for $\\alpha$ that are\nin agreement within statistical uncertainties and very stable against several\nconsistency tests. Considering the $T$--$B$ and $E$--$B$ information jointly,\nwe find $\\alpha = 0.31^{\\circ} \\pm 0.05^{\\circ} \\, ({\\rm stat.})\\, \\pm\n0.28^{\\circ} \\, ({\\rm syst.})$ from the harmonic analysis and $\\alpha =\n0.35^{\\circ} \\pm 0.05^{\\circ} \\, ({\\rm stat.})\\, \\pm 0.28^{\\circ} \\, ({\\rm\nsyst.})$ from the stacking approach. These constraints are compatible with no\nparity violation and are dominated by the systematic uncertainty in the\norientation of Planck's polarization-sensitive bolometers.\n", "  The nature of the vertical thermal structure of hot Jupiter atmospheres is\none of the key questions raised by the characterization of transiting\nexoplanets over the last decade. There have been claims that many hot Jupiter's\nexhibit vertical profiles with increasing temperature with decreasing pressure\nin the infrared photosphere that leads to the reversal of molecular absorption\nbands into emission features (an inversion). However, these claims have been\nbased on broadband photometry rather than the unambiguous identification of\nemission features with spectroscopy, and the chemical species that could cause\nthe thermal inversions by absorbing stellar irradiation at high altitudes have\nnot been identified despite extensive theoretical and observational effort.\nHere we present high precision HST WFC3 observations of the dayside emission\nspectrum of the hot Jupiter HD209458b; the first exoplanet suggested to have a\nthermal inversion. Our observations resolve a water band in absorption at 6.2\nsigma confidence. When combined with Spitzer photometry the data are indicative\nof a monotonically decreasing temperature with pressure over the range 1-0.001\nbar at 7.7 sigma confidence. We test the robustness of our results by exploring\na variety of model assumptions including the temperature profile\nparameterization, presence of a cloud, and choice of Spitzer data reduction. We\nalso introduce a new analysis method, \"chemical retrieval-on-retrieval\", to\ndetermine the elemental abundances from the spectrally retrieved mixing ratios\nwith thermochemical self-consistency and find plausible abundances consistent\nwith solar metallicity (0.06 - 10 x solar) and carbon-to-oxygen ratios less\nthan unity. This work suggests that high-precision spectrophotometric results\nare required to robustly infer thermal structures and compositions of\nextra-solar planet atmospheres.\n", "  Using the Planck 2015 data release (PR2) temperature maps, we separate\nGalactic thermal dust emission from cosmic infrared background (CIB)\nanisotropies. For this purpose, we implement a specifically tailored\ncomponent-separation method, the so-called generalized needlet internal linear\ncombination (GNILC) method, which uses spatial information (the angular power\nspectra) to disentangle the Galactic dust emission and CIB anisotropies. We\nproduce significantly improved all-sky maps of Planck thermal dust emission,\nwith reduced CIB contamination, at 353, 545, and 857 GHz. By reducing the CIB\ncontamination of the thermal dust maps, we provide more accurate estimates of\nthe local dust temperature and dust spectral index over the sky with reduced\ndispersion, especially at high Galactic latitudes above $b = \\pm 20{\\deg}$. We\nfind that the dust temperature is $T = (19.4 \\pm 1.3)$ K and the dust spectral\nindex is $\\beta = 1.6 \\pm 0.1$ averaged over the whole sky, while $T = (19.4\n\\pm 1.5)$ K and $\\beta = 1.6 \\pm 0.2$ on 21 % of the sky at high latitudes.\nMoreover, subtracting the new CIB-removed thermal dust maps from the\nCMB-removed Planck maps gives access to the CIB anisotropies over 60 % of the\nsky at Galactic latitudes $|b| > 20{\\deg}$. Because they are a significant\nimprovement over previous Planck products, the GNILC maps are recommended for\nthermal dust science. The new CIB maps can be regarded as indirect tracers of\nthe dark matter and they are recommended for exploring cross-correlations with\nlensing and large-scale structure optical surveys. The reconstructed GNILC\nthermal dust and CIB maps are delivered as Planck products.\n", "  FRIDA is a diffraction-limited imager and integral-field spectrometer that is\nbeing built for the adaptive-optics focus of the Gran Telescopio Canarias. In\nimaging mode FRIDA will provide scales of 0.010, 0.020 and 0.040 arcsec/pixel\nand in IFS mode spectral resolutions of 1500, 4000 and 30,000. FRIDA is\nstarting systems integration and is scheduled to complete fully integrated\nsystem tests at the laboratory by the end of 2017 and to be delivered to GTC\nshortly thereafter. In this contribution we present a summary of its design,\nfabrication, current status and potential scientific applications.\n", "  Quantum computers are the ideal platform for quantum simulations. Given\nenough coherent operations and qubits, such machines can be leveraged to\nsimulate strongly correlated materials, where intricate quantum effects give\nrise to counter-intuitive macroscopic phenomena such as high-temperature\nsuperconductivity. In this paper, we provide a gate decomposition and an\narchitecture for a quantum simulator used to simulate the Fermi-Hubbard model\nin a hybrid variational quantum-classical algorithm. We propose a simple planar\nimplementation-independent layout of qubits that can also be used to simulate\nmore general fermionic systems. By working through a concrete application, we\nshow the gate decomposition used to simulate the Hamiltonian of a cluster of\nthe Fermi-Hubbard model. We briefly analyze the Trotter-Suzuki errors and\nestimate the scaling properties of the algorithm for more complex applications.\n", "  The non-linear Compton scattering rate in a rotating electric field is\nexplicitly calculated for the first time. For this purpose, a novel solution to\nthe Klein-Gordon equation in the presence of a rotating electric field is\napplied. An analytical expression for the emission rate is obtained, as well as\na simplified approximation adequate for emplementation in kinetic codes. The\nspectrum is numerically calculated for nowadays optical and X-ray laser\nparameters. The results are compared to the standard Volkov-Ritus rate for a\nparticle in a plane wave, which is commonly assumed to be valid for a rotating\nelectric field under certain conditions. Subsequent deviations between the two\nmodels, both in the radiated power and the spectral shape, are demonstrated.\nFirst, the typical number of photons participating in the scattering process is\nmuch smaller compared to the Volkov-Ritus rate, resulting in up to an order of\nmagnitude lower emitted power. Furthermore, our model predicts a discrete\nharmonics spectrum for electrons with low asymptotic momentum compared to the\nfield amplitude. This discrete structure is a clear imprint of the electric\nfield frequency, as opposed to the Volkov-Ritus rate which reduces to the\nconstant crossed field rate for the physical conditions under consideration.\nOur model predictions can be tested with present-days laser facilities.\n", "  Rapidly rotating neutron stars are promising sources of continuous\ngravitational wave radiation for the LIGO and Virgo interferometers. The\nmajority of neutron stars in our galaxy have not been identified with\nelectromagnetic observations. All-sky searches for isolated neutron stars offer\nthe potential to detect gravitational waves from these unidentified sources.\nThe parameter space of these blind all-sky searches, which also cover a large\nrange of frequencies and frequency derivatives, presents a significant\ncomputational challenge. Different methods have been designed to perform these\nsearches within acceptable computational limits. Here we describe the first\nbenchmark in a project to compare the search methods currently available for\nthe detection of unknown isolated neutron stars. We employ a mock data\nchallenge to compare the ability of each search method to recover signals\nsimulated assuming a standard signal model. We find similar performance among\nthe short duration search methods, while the long duration search method\nachieves up to a factor of two higher sensitivity. We find the absence of\nsecond derivative frequency in the search parameter space does not degrade\nsearch sensivity for signals with physically plausible second derivative\nfrequencies. We also report on the parameter estimation accuracy of each search\nmethod, and the stability of the sensitivity in frequency, frequency derivative\nand in the presence of detector noise.\n", "  COATLI will provide 0.3 arcsec FWHM images from 550 to 900 nm over a large\nfraction of the sky. It consists of a robotic 50-cm telescope with a\ndiffraction-limited fast-guiding imager. Since the telescope is small, fast\nguiding will provide diffraction-limited image quality over a field of at least\n1 arcmin and with coverage of a large fraction of the sky, even in relatively\npoor seeing. The COATLI telescope will be installed at the at the Observatorio\nAstron\\'omico Nacional in Sierra San Pedro M\\'artir, M\\'exico, during 2016 and\nthe diffraction-limited imager will follow in 2017.\n", "  Flowing black holes are asymptotically locally AdS spacetimes that are\nstationary but have non-Killing horizons. Holographically, they are dual to a\nsteady-state heat flow in the boundary field theory. We investigate the\nstability of these black holes in the limit in which they are well-described by\nthe relativistic conformal Navier-Stokes equations. More precisely, we study\nthe quasi-normal modes of the linearized ideal fluid equations. Though we find\nno unstable modes, there are an infinite number at finite transverse momentum\nwhich are arbitrarily long-lived. This suggests the possibility that either\nnon-modal effects or nonlinear interactions between these modes can give rise\nto new types of gravitational instabilities.\n", "  The algorithms used by the ATLAS Collaboration to reconstruct and identify\nprompt photons are described. Measurements of the photon identification\nefficiencies are reported, using 4.9 fb$^{-1}$ of pp collision data collected\nat the LHC at $\\sqrt{s}$=7 TeV and 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ at $\\sqrt{s}$=8 TeV. The\nefficiencies are measured separately for converted and unconverted photons, in\nfour different pseudorapidity regions, for transverse momenta between 10 GeV\nand 1.5 TeV. The results from the combination of three data-driven techniques\nare compared to the predictions from a simulation of the detector response,\nafter correcting the electromagnetic shower momenta in the simulation for the\naverage differences observed with respect to data. Data-to-simulation\nefficiency ratios used as correction factors in physics measurements are\ndetermined to account for the small residual efficiency differences. These\nfactors are measured with uncertainties between 0.5% and 10% in 7 TeV data and\nbetween 0.5% and 5.6% in 8 TeV data, depending on the photon transverse\nmomentum and pseudorapidity.\n", "  $\\mathcal{N}=1$ $SU(N)$ super-Yang-Mills theory on $\\mathbb{R}^3\\times S^1$\nis believed to have a smooth dependence on the circle size $L$. Making $L$\nsmall leads to calculable non-perturbative color confinement, mass gap, and\nstring tensions. For finite $N$, the small-$L$ low-energy dynamics is described\nby a three-dimensional effective theory. The large-$N$ limit, however, reveals\nsurprises: the infrared dual description is in terms of a theory with an\nemergent fourth dimension, curiously reminiscent of T-duality in string theory.\nHere, however, the emergent dimension is a lattice, with momenta related to the\n$S^1$-winding of the gauge field holonomy, which takes values in\n$\\mathbb{Z}_N$. Furthermore, the low-energy description is given by a\nnon-trivial gapless theory, with a space-like $z=2$ Lifshitz scale invariance\nand operators that pick up anomalous dimensions as $L$ is increased.\nSupersymmetry-breaking deformations leave the long-distance theory\nscale-invariant, but change the Lifshitz scaling exponent to $z=1$, and lead to\nan emergent Lorentz symmetry at small $L$. Adding a small number of fundamental\nfermion fields leads to matter localized on three-dimensional branes in the\nemergent four-dimensional theory.\n", "  Using full 3D finite element simulation and underlining Hamiltonian models,\nwe demonstrate reconfigurable photonic analogues of topological insulators on a\nregular lattice of tunable posts in a re-entrant 3D lumped element type system.\nThe tunability allows dynamical {\\it in-situ} change of media chirality and\nother properties via alteration of the same parameter for all posts, and as a\nresult, great flexibility in choice of bulk/edge configurations. Additionally,\none way photon transport without an external magnetic field is demonstrated.\nThe ideas are illustrated by using both full finite element simulation as well\nas simplified harmonic oscillator models. Dynamical reconfigurability of the\nproposed systems paves the way to a new class of systems that can be employed\nfor random access, topological signal processing and sensing.\n", "  An estimator for the dynamical temperature in an arbitrary ensemble is\nderived in the framework of Bayesian statistical mechanics and the maximum\nentropy principle. We test this estimator numerically by a simulation of the\ntwo-dimensional XY-model in the canonical ensemble. As this model is critical\nin the whole region of temperatures below the Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless\ncritical temperature $T_{BKT}$, we use a generalization of Wolff's uni-cluster\nalgorithm. The numerical results allow us to confirm the robustness of the\nanalytical expression for the microscopic estimator of the temperature. This\nmicroscopic estimator has also the advantage that it gives a direct measure of\nthe thermalization process and can be used to compute absolute errors\nassociated to statistical fluctuations. In consequence, this estimator allows\nfor a direct, absolute and astringent test of the ergodicity of the underlying\nMarkov process, which encodes the algorithm used in a numerical simulation.\n", "  The DANSS project is aimed at creating a relatively compact neutrino\nspectrometer which does not contain any flammable or other dangerous liquids\nand may therefore be located very close to the core of an industrial power\nreactor. As a result, it is expected that high neutrino flux would provide\nabout 15,000 IBD interactions per day in the detector with a sensitive volume\nof 1 m$^3$. High segmentation of the plastic scintillator will allow to\nsuppress a background down to a 1% level. Numerous tests performed with a\nsimplified pilot prototype DANSSino under a 3 GW$_{th}$ reactor of the Kalinin\nNPP have demonstrated operability of the chosen design. The DANSS detector\nsurrounded with a composite shield is movable by means of a special lifting\ngear, varying the distance to the reactor core in a range from 10 m to 12 m.\nDue to this feature, it could be used not only for the reactor monitoring, but\nalso for fundamental research including short-range neutrino oscillations to\nthe sterile state. Supposing one-year measurement, the sensitivity to the\noscillation parameters is expected to reach a level of $sin^2(2\\theta)$ ~ 0.005\nwith $\\Delta m^2 \\subset (0.02-5.0)$ eV$^2$.\n", "  We present the discovery and first three months of follow-up observations of\na currently on-going unusual transient detected by the OGLE-IV survey, located\nin the centre of a galaxy at redshift z=0.1655. The long rise to absolute\nmagnitude of -20.5 mag, slow decline, very broad He and H spectral features\nmake OGLE16aaa similar to other optical/UV Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs). Weak\nnarrow emission lines in the spectrum and archival photometric observations\nsuggest the host galaxy is a weak-line Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), which has\nbeen accreting at higher rate in the past. OGLE16aaa, along with SDSS J0748,\nseems to form a sub-class of TDEs by weakly or recently active super-massive\nblack holes (SMBHs). This class might bridge the TDEs by quiescent SMBHs and\nflares observed as \"changing-look QSOs\", if we interpret the latter as TDEs. If\nthis picture is true, the previously applied requirement for identifying a\nflare as a TDE that it had to come from an inactive nucleus, could be leading\nto observational bias in TDE selection, thus affecting TDE-rate estimations.\n", "  Symmetries play an essential role in identifying and characterizing\ntopological states of matter. Here, we classify topologically two-dimensional\n(2D) insulators and semimetals with vanishing spin-orbit coupling using\ntime-reversal ($\\mathcal{T}$) and inversion ($\\mathcal{I}$) symmetry. This\nallows us to link the presence of edge states in $\\mathcal{I}$ and\n$\\mathcal{T}$ symmetric 2D insulators, which are topologically trivial\naccording to the Altland-Zirnbauer table, to a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological\ninvariant. This invariant is directly related to the quantization of the Zak\nphase. It also predicts the generic presence of edge states in Dirac\nsemimetals, in the absence of chiral symmetry. We then apply our findings to\nbilayer black phosphorus and show the occurrence of a gate-induced topological\nphase transition, where the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant changes.\n", "  Probing correlations among short and long-wavelength cosmological\nfluctuations is known to be decisive for deepening the current understanding of\ninflation at the microphysical level. Spectral distortions of the CMB can be\ncaused by dissipation of cosmological perturbations when they re-enter Hubble\nafter inflation. Correlating spectral distortions with temperature anisotropies\nwill thus provide the opportunity to greatly enlarge the range of scales over\nwhich squeezed limits can be tested, opening up a new window on inflation\ncomplementing the ones currently probed with CMB and LSS. In this paper we\ndiscuss a variety of inflationary mechanisms that can be efficiently\nconstrained with distortion-temperature correlations. For some of these\nrealizations (representative of large classes of models) we derive quantitative\npredictions for the squeezed limit bispectra, finding that their amplitudes are\nabove the sensitivity limits of an experiment such as the proposed PIXIE.\n", "  The EXtreme PREcision Spectrograph (EXPRES) is an optical fiber fed echelle\ninstrument being designed and built at the Yale Exoplanet Laboratory to be\ninstalled on the 4.3-meter Discovery Channel Telescope operated by Lowell\nObservatory. The primary science driver for EXPRES is to detect Earth-like\nworlds around Sun-like stars. With this in mind, we are designing the\nspectrograph to have an instrumental precision of 15 cm/s so that the on-sky\nmeasurement precision (that includes modeling for RV noise from the star) can\nreach to better than 30 cm/s. This goal places challenging requirements on\nevery aspect of the instrument development, including optomechanical design,\nenvironmental control, image stabilization, wavelength calibration, and data\nanalysis. In this paper we describe our error budget, and instrument\noptomechanical design.\n", "  Single-dish sub-millimeter observations have recently revealed the existence\nof a substantial, chemically peculiar, molecular gas component located in the\ninnermost circumstellar environment of the very massive luminous blue variable\nstar $\\eta$ Carinae. Here, we present 5$\"$-resolution interferometric\nobservations of the 1$\\rightarrow$0 rotational transition of hydrogen cyanide\n(HCN) obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) toward this\nstar. The emission is concentrated in the central few arcseconds around $\\eta$\nCarinae and shows a clear 150 km s$^{-1}$ velocity gradient running from\nwest-north-west (blue) to east-south-east (red). Given the extent, location,\nand kinematics of this molecular material, we associate it with the complex of\ndusty arcs and knots seen in mid-infrared emission near the center of the\nHomunculus nebula. Indeed, the shielding provided by this dust could help\nexplain how molecules survive in the presence of the intense UV radiation field\nproduced by $\\eta$ Carinae. The dust located in the central few arcseconds\naround $\\eta$ Carinae and the molecular component described here have most\nlikely formed in situ, out of material expelled by the massive interacting\nbinary system. Thus, $\\eta$ Carinae offers us a rare glimpse on the processes\nleading to the formation of dust and molecules around massive stars that are so\nrelevant to the interpretation of dust and molecule detections at high\nredshifts.\n", "  Magnetic Skyrmions and multiferroics are the most interesting objects in\nnanostructure science that have great potential in future spin-electronic\ntechnology. The study of multiferroic Skyrmions has attracted much interest in\nrecent years. This article reports magnetic Bloch Skyrmions induced by an\nelectric driving field in a composite bilayer (chiral-magnetic/ferroelectric\nbilayer) lattice. By using the spin dynamics method, we use a classical\nmagnetic spin model and an electric pseudospin model, which are coupled by a\nstrong magnetoelectric coupling in the dynamical simulations. Interestingly, we\nobserve some skyrmion-like objects in the electric component either during the\nswitching process or by applying a magnetic field, which is due to the\nconnection between the electric and the magnetic structures.\n", "  A majority of studied models for scale-free networks have degree\ndistributions with exponents greater than $2$. Real networks, however, can\ndemonstrate essentially more heavy-tailed degree distributions. We explore two\nmodels of scale-free equilibrium networks that have the degree distribution\nexponent $\\gamma = 1$, $P(q) \\sim q^{-\\gamma}$. Such degree distributions can\nbe identified in empirical data only if the mean degree of a network is\nsufficiently high. Our models exploit a rewiring mechanism. They are local in\nthe sense that no knowledge of the network structure, apart from the immediate\nneighbourhood of the vertices, is required. These models generate uncorrelated\nnetworks in the infinite size limit, where they are solved explicitly. We\ninvestigate finite size effects by the use of simulations. We find that both\nmodels exhibit disassortative degree-degree correlations for finite network\nsizes. In addition, we observe a markedly degree-dependent clustering in the\nfinite networks. We indicate a real-world network with a similar degree\ndistribution.\n", "  We make use of deep 1.2mm-continuum observations (12.7microJy/beam RMS) of a\n1 arcmin^2 region in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field to probe dust-enshrouded star\nformation from 330 Lyman-break galaxies spanning the redshift range z=2-10 (to\n~2-3 Msol/yr at 1sigma over the entire range). Given the depth and area of\nASPECS, we would expect to tentatively detect 35 galaxies extrapolating the\nMeurer z~0 IRX-beta relation to z>~2 (assuming T_d~35 K). However, only 6\ntentative detections are found at z>~2 in ASPECS, with just three at >3sigma.\nSubdividing z=2-10 galaxies according to stellar mass, UV luminosity, and\nUV-continuum slope and stacking the results, we only find a significant\ndetection in the most massive (>10^9.75 Msol) subsample, with an infrared\nexcess (IRX=L_{IR}/L_{UV}) consistent with previous z~2 results. However, the\ninfrared excess we measure from our large selection of sub-L* (<10^9.75 Msol)\ngalaxies is 0.11(-0.42)(+0.32) and 0.14(-0.14)(+0.15) at z=2-3 and z=4-10,\nrespectively, lying below even an SMC IRX-beta relation (95% confidence). These\nresults demonstrate the relevance of stellar mass for predicting the IR\nluminosity of z>~2 galaxies. We furthermore find that the evolution of the\nIRX-stellar mass relationship depends on the evolution of the dust temperature.\nIf the dust temperature increases monotonically with redshift (as (1+z)^0.32)\nsuch that T_d~44-50 K at z>=4, current results are suggestive of little\nevolution in this relationship to z~6. We use these results to revisit recent\nestimates of the z>~3 SFR density. One less obvious implication is in\ninterpreting the high Halpha EWs seen in z~5 galaxies: our results imply that\nstar-forming galaxies produce Lyman-continuum photons at twice the efficiency\n(per unit UV luminosity) as implied in conventional models. Star-forming\ngalaxies can then reionize the Universe, even if the escape fraction is <10%.\n", "  We describe the phenomenon of localization in the epidemic SIS model on\nhighly heterogeneous networks in which strongly connected nodes (hubs) play the\nrole of centers of localization. We find that in this model the localized\nstates below the epidemic threshold are metastable. The longevity and scale of\nthe metastable outbreaks do not show a sharp localization transition, instead\nthere is a smooth crossover from localized to delocalized states as we approach\nthe epidemic threshold from below. Analyzing these long-lasting local outbreaks\nfor a random regular graph with a hub, we show how this localization can be\ndetected from the shape of the distribution of the number of infective nodes.\n", "  We present AGNfitter, a publicly available open-source algorithm implementing\na fully Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to fit the spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the sub-mm to the UV,\nallowing one to robustly disentangle the physical processes responsible for\ntheir emission. AGNfitter makes use of a large library of theoretical,\nempirical, and semi-empirical models to characterize both the nuclear and host\ngalaxy emission simultaneously. The model consists of four physical emission\ncomponents: an accretion disk, a torus of AGN heated dust, stellar populations,\nand cold dust in star forming regions. AGNfitter determines the posterior\ndistributions of numerous parameters that govern the physics of AGN with a\nfully Bayesian treatment of errors and parameter degeneracies, allowing one to\ninfer integrated luminosities, dust attenuation parameters, stellar masses, and\nstar formation rates. We tested AGNfitter's performace on real data by fitting\nthe SEDs of a sample of 714 X-ray selected AGN from the XMM-COSMOS survey,\nspectroscopically classified as Type1 (unobscured) and Type2 (obscured) AGN by\ntheir optical-UV emission lines. We find that two independent model parameters,\nnamely the reddening of the accretion disk and the column density of the dusty\ntorus, are good proxies for AGN obscuration, allowing us to develop a strategy\nfor classifying AGN as Type1 or Type2, based solely on an SED-fitting analysis.\nOur classification scheme is in excellent agreement with the spectroscopic\nclassification, giving a completeness fraction of $\\sim 86\\%$ and $\\sim 70\\%$,\nand an efficiency of $\\sim 80\\%$ and $\\sim 77\\%$, for Type1 and Type2 AGNs,\nrespectively.\n", "  We present a systematic investigation of the special twist method introduced\nby Rajagopal $\\textit{et al.}$ [ Phys. Rev. B 51, 10591 (1995) ] for reducing\nfinite-size effects in correlated calculations of periodic extended systems\nwith Coulomb interactions and Fermi statistics. We propose a procedure for\nfinding special twist values which, at variance with previous applications of\nthis method, reproduce the energy of the mean-field infinite-size limit\nsolution within an adjustable (arbitrarily small) numerical error. This choice\nof the special twist is shown to be the most accurate single-twist solution for\ncuring one-body finite-size effects in correlated calculations. For these\nreasons we dubbed our procedure \"exact special twist\" (EST). EST only needs a\nfully converged independent-particles or mean-field calculation within the\nprimitive cell and a simple fit to find the special twist along a specific\ndirection in the Brillouin zone. We first assess the performances of EST in a\nsimple correlated model such as the 3D electron gas. Afterwards, we test its\nefficiency within $\\textit{ab initio}$ quantum Monte Carlo simulations of\nmetallic elements of increasing complexity. We show that EST displays an\noverall good performance in reducing finite-size errors comparable to the\nwidely used twist average technique but at a much lower computational cost,\nsince it involves the evaluation of just one wavefunction. We also demonstrate\nthat the EST method shows similar performances in the calculation of\ncorrelation functions, such as the ionic forces for structural relaxation and\nthe pair radial distribution function in liquid hydrogen. Our conclusions point\nto the usefulness of EST for correlated supercell calculations, our method will\nbe particularly relevant when the physical problem under consideration requires\nlarge periodic cells.\n", "  In this article we derive the geodesic equations in the $\\text{U(1)}^2$\ndyonic rotating black hole spacetime. We present their solutions in terms of\nthe Kleinian $\\sigma$-function and in special cases in terms of the\nWeierstra{\\ss} $\\wp$-, $\\sigma$- and $\\zeta$-functions. To give a list of all\npossible orbits, we analyse the geodesic motion of test particles and light\nusing parametric diagrams and effective potentials.\n", "  We utilize nonlinear absorption to design all-optical protocols that improve\nboth charge state initialization and spin readout for the nitrogen-vacancy (NV)\ncenter in diamond. Non-monotonic variations in the equilibrium charge state as\na function of visible and near-infrared (NIR) optical power are attributed to\ncompeting multiphoton absorption processes. In certain regimes, multicolor\nillumination enhances the steady-state population of the NV's negative charge\nstate above 90%. At higher NIR intensities, selective ionization of the singlet\nmanifold facilitates a protocol for spin-to-charge conversion that dramatically\nenhances the spin readout fidelity. We demonstrate a 6-fold increase in the\nsignal-to-noise ratio for single-shot spin measurements and predict an\norders-of-magnitude experimental speedup over traditional methods for emerging\napplications in magnetometry and quantum information science using NV spins.\n", "  Experiments in the field of optomechanics do not yet fully exploit the photon\npolarization degree of freedom. Here experimental results for an optomechanical\ninteraction in a polarization nondegenerate system are presented and schemes\nare proposed for how to use this interaction to perform accurate side-band\nthermometry and to create novel forms of photon-phonon entanglement. The\nexperimental system utilizes the compressive force in the mirror attached to a\nmechanical resonator to create a micro-mirror with two radii of curvature which\nleads, when combined with a second mirror, to a significant polarization\nsplitting of the cavity modes.\n", "  The intermediate mass-ratio inspiral of a stellar compact remnant into an\nintermediate mass black hole (IMBH) can produce a gravitational wave (GW)\nsignal that is potentially detectable by current ground-based GW detectors\n(e.g., Advanced LIGO) as well as by planned space-based interferometers (e.g.,\neLISA). Here, we present results from a direct integration of the\npost-Newtonian $N$-body equations of motion describing stellar clusters\ncontaining an IMBH and a population of stellar-mass black holes (BHs) and solar\nmass stars. We take particular care to simulate the dynamics closest to the\nIMBH, including post-Newtonian effects up to order $2.5$. Our simulations show\nthat the IMBH readily forms a binary with a BH companion. This binary is\ngradually hardened by transient 3-body or 4-body encounters, leading to\nfrequent substitutions of the BH companion, while the binary's eccentricity\nexperiences large amplitude oscillations due to the Lidov-Kozai resonance. We\nalso demonstrate suppression of these resonances by the relativistic precession\nof the binary orbit. We find an intermediate mass-ratio inspiral in one of the\n12 cluster models we evolved for $\\sim 100$ Myr. This cluster hosts a $100\nM_\\odot$ IMBH embedded in a population of 32 $10M_\\odot$ BH and 32,000\n$1M_\\odot$ stars. At the end of the simulation, after $\\sim 100$ Myr of\nevolution, the IMBH merges with a BH companion. The IMBH--BH binary inspiral\nstarts in the eLISA frequency window ($\\gtrsim 1\\rm mHz$) when the binary\nreaches an eccentricity $1-e\\simeq 10^{-3}$. After $\\simeq 10^5$ years the\nbinary moves into the LIGO frequency band with a negligible eccentricity. We\ncomment on the implications for GW searches, with a possible detection within\nthe next decade.\n", "  A picture of confinement in QCD based on a condensate of thick vortices with\nfluxes in the center of the gauge group (center vortices) is studied. Previous\nconcrete model realizations of this picture utilized a hypercubic space-time\nscaffolding, which, together with many advantages, also has some disadvantages,\ne.g., in the treatment of vortex topological charge. In the present work, we\nexplore a center vortex model which does not rely on such a scaffolding.\nVortices are represented by closed random lines in continuous 2+1-dimensional\nspace-time. These random lines are modeled as being piece-wise linear, and an\nensemble is generated by Monte Carlo methods. The physical space in which the\nvortex lines are defined is a torus with periodic boundary conditions. Besides\nmoving, growing and shrinking of the vortex configurations, also reconnections\nare allowed. Our ensemble therefore contains not a fixed, but a variable number\nof closed vortex lines. This is expected to be important for realizing the\ndeconfining phase transition. We study both vortex percolation and the\npotential V (R) between quark and anti-quark as a function of distance R at\ndifferent vortex densities, vortex segment lengths, reconnection conditions and\nat different temperatures. We find three deconfinement phase transitions, as a\nfunction of density, as a function of vortex segment length, and as a function\nof temperature.\n", "  We report on the development and construction of a new fiber-fed,\nred-optical, high-precision radial-velocity spectrograph for one of the twin\n6.5m Magellan Telescopes in Chile. MAROON-X will be optimized to find and\ncharacterize rocky planets around nearby M dwarfs with an intrinsic per\nmeasurement noise floor below 1 m/s. The instrument is based on a commercial\nechelle spectrograph customized for high stability and throughput. A microlens\narray based pupil slicer and double scrambler, as well as a rubidium-referenced\netalon comb calibrator will turn this spectrograph into a high-precision\nradial-velocity machine. MAROON-X will undergo extensive lab tests in the\nsecond half of 2016.\n", "  We investigate black hole thermodynamics involving a scalar hair which is\ndual to a momentum relaxation of the dual field theory. This black hole\ngeometry is able to be classified by two parameters. One is a momentum\nrelaxation and the other is a mass density of another matter localized at the\ncenter. Even though all parameters are continuous, there exists a specific\npoint where its thermodynamic interpretation is not continuously connected to\nthe one defined in the other parameter regime. The similar feature also appears\nin a topological AdS black hole. In this work, we show why such an unusual\nthermodynamic feature happens and provide a unified way to understand such an\nexotic black hole thermodynamically in the entire parameter range.\n", "  Quadratic gravity in two dimensions can be formulated as a Background Field\n(BF) theory plus an interaction term which is polynomial in both, the gauge and\nBackground fields. This formulation is similar to the one given by Freidel and\nStarodubtsev to obtain MacDowell-Mansouri gravity in four dimensions.\n  In this article we use the Dirac's Hamiltonian formalism to analyze the\nconstraint structure of the two-dimensional Polynomial BF action. After we\nobtain the constraints of the theory, we proceed with the\nBatalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky procedure to obtain the transition amplitude. We\nalso compare our results with the ones obtained from generalized dilaton\ngravity.\n", "  We consider the details of the near-surface electronic band structure of a\nprototypical ferromagnet, Fe(001). Using high resolution angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy we demonstrate openings of the spin-orbit induced\nelectronic band gaps near the Fermi level. The band gaps and thus the Fermi\nsurface can be manipulated by changing the remanent magnetization direction.\nThe effect is of the order of $\\Delta$E = 100 meV and $\\Delta \\text {k} =\n0.1\\,\\text{\\AA}^{-1}$. We show that the observed dispersions are dominated by\nthe bulk band structure. First-principles calculations and one-step\nphotoemission calculations suggest that the effect is related to changes in the\nelectronic ground state, rather than caused by the photoemission process\nitself. The symmetry of the effect indicates that the observed electronic bulk\nstates are influenced by the presence of the surface, which might be understood\nas related to a Rashba-type effect. By pinpointing the regions in the\nelectronic band structure where the switchable band gaps occur, we demonstrate\nthe significance of spin-orbit interaction even for elements as light as 3d\nferromagnets.\n", "  We consider anisotropic long-range interacting spin systems in $d$\ndimensions. The interaction between the spins decays with the distance as a\npower law with different exponents in different directions: we consider an\nexponent $d_{1}+\\sigma_1$ in $d_1$ directions and another exponent\n$d_{2}+\\sigma_2$ in the remaining $d_2\\equiv d-d_1$ ones. We introduce a low\nenergy effective action with non analytic power of the momenta. As a function\nof the two exponents $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$ we show the system to have three\ndifferent regimes, two where it is actually anisotropic and one where the\nisotropy is finally restored. We determine the phase diagram and provide\nestimates of the critical exponents as a function of the parameters of the\nsystem, in particular considering the case of one of the two $\\sigma$'s fixed\nand the other varying. A discussion of the physical relevance of our results is\nalso presented.\n", "  Neutron-skins in coordinate space and proton-skins in momentum space are\npredicted to coexist in heavy nuclei and their correlation is governed by\nLiouville's theorem and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. An analysis of\ntheir correlation within a further extended Thomas-Fermi (ETF$^+$)\napproximation incorporating effects of nucleon short-range correlations reveals\ngenerally that protons move faster than neutrons in neutron-skins of heavy\nnuclei.\n", "  We propose schemes of controlled-Z and controlled-NOT gates with ultracold\nneutral atoms based on deterministic phase accumulation during double adiabatic\npassage of the Stark-tuned F\\\"{o}rster resonance of Rydberg states. The effect\nof deterministic phase accumulation during double adiabatic passage in a\ntwo-level quantum system has been analyzed in detail. Adiabatic rapid passage\nusing nonlinearly chirped pulses with rectangle intensity profile has been\ndiscussed. Nonlinear time dependence of the energy detuning from the\nF\\\"{o}rster resonance is used to achieve a high fidelity of population transfer\nbetween Rydberg states. Fidelity of two-qubit gates has been studied with an\nexample of the $90S+96S\\to 90P+95P$ Stark-tuned F\\\"{o}rster resonance in Cs\nRydberg atoms.\n", "  We present the second multi-frequency radio detection of a reverse shock in a\n$\\gamma$-ray burst. By combining our extensive radio observations of the\nFermi-LAT GRB 160509A at $z = 1.17$ up to $20$ days after the burst with Swift\nX-ray observations and ground-based optical and near-infrared data, we show\nthat the afterglow emission comprises distinct reverse shock and forward shock\ncontributions: the reverse shock emission dominates in the radio band at\n$\\lesssim10~$days, while the forward shock emission dominates in the X-ray,\noptical, and near-infrared bands. Through multi-wavelength modeling, we\ndetermine a circumburst density of $n_0\\approx10^{-3}~$cm$^{-3}$, supporting\nour previous suggestion that a low-density circumburst environment is conducive\nto the production of long-lasting reverse shock radiation in the radio band. We\ninfer the presence of a large excess X-ray absorption column, $N_{\\rm H}\n\\approx 1.5\\times10^{22}~$cm$^{-2}$, and a high rest-frame optical extinction,\n$A_{\\rm V}\\approx3.4~$mag. We identify a jet break in the X-ray light curve at\n$t_{\\rm jet}\\approx6~$d, and thus derive a jet opening angle of $\\theta_{\\rm\njet}\\approx4~$deg, yielding a beaming-corrected kinetic energy and radiated\n$\\gamma$-ray energy of $E_{\\rm K}\\approx4\\times10^{50}~$erg and\n$E_{\\gamma}\\approx1.3\\times10^{51}~$erg ($1$-$10^4~$keV, rest frame),\nrespectively. Consistency arguments connecting the forward and reverse shocks\nsuggest a deceleration time of $t_{\\rm dec} \\approx 460~$s$~\\approx T_{90}$, a\nLorentz factor of $\\Gamma(t_{\\rm dec})\\approx330$, and a reverse shock to\nforward shock fractional magnetic energy density ratio of $R_{\\rm\nB}\\equiv\\epsilon_{\\rm B,RS}/\\epsilon_{\\rm B,FS}\\approx8$.\n", "  We study Weyl semimetals in the presence of generic disorder, consisting of a\nrandom vector potential as well as a random scalar potential. We derive\nrenormalization group flow equations to second order in the disorder strength.\nThese flow equations predict a disorder-induced phase transition between a\npseudo-ballistic weak-disorder phase and a diffusive strong-disorder phase for\nsufficiently strong random scalar potential or for a pure three-component\nrandom vector potential. We verify these predictions using a numerical study of\nthe density of states near the Weyl point and of quantum transport properties\nat the Weyl point. In contrast, for a pure single-component random vector\npotential the diffusive strong-disorder phase is absent.\n", "  HiPERCAM is a high-speed camera for the study of rapid variability in the\nUniverse. The project is funded by a 3.5MEuro European Research Council\nAdvanced Grant. HiPERCAM builds on the success of our previous instrument,\nULTRACAM, with very significant improvements in performance thanks to the use\nof the latest technologies. HiPERCAM will use 4 dichroic beamsplitters to image\nsimultaneously in 5 optical channels covering the u'g'r'i'z' bands. Frame rates\nof over 1000 per second will be achievable using an ESO CCD controller (NGC),\nwith every frame GPS timestamped. The detectors are custom-made, frame-transfer\nCCDs from e2v, with 4 low-noise (2.5e-) outputs, mounted in small\nthermoelectrically-cooled heads operated at 180 K, resulting in virtually no\ndark current. The two reddest CCDs will be deep-depletion devices with\nanti-etaloning, providing high quantum efficiencies across the red part of the\nspectrum with no fringing. The instrument will also incorporate scintillation\nnoise correction via the conjugate-plane photometry technique. The\nopto-mechanical chassis will make use of additive manufacturing techniques in\nmetal to make a light-weight, rigid and temperature-invariant structure. First\nlight is expected on the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope on La Palma in 2017\n(on which the field of view will be 10' with a 0.3\"/pixel scale), with\nsubsequent use planned on the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias on La Palma (on\nwhich the field of view will be 4' with a 0.11\"/pixel scale) and the 3.5m New\nTechnology Telescope in Chile.\n", "  Various theories that aim at unifying gravity with quantum mechanics suggest\nmodifications of the Heisenberg algebra for position and momentum. From the\nperspective of quantum mechanics, such modifications lead to new uncertainty\nrelations which are thought (but not proven) to imply the existence of a\nminimal observable length. Here we prove this statement in a framework of\nsufficient physical and structural assumptions. Moreover, we present a general\nmethod that allows to formulate optimal and state-independent variance-based\nuncertainty relations. In addition, instead of variances, we make use of\nentropies as a measure of uncertainty and provide uncertainty relations in\nterms of min- and Shannon entropies. We compute the corresponding entropic\nminimal lengths and find that the minimal length in terms of min-entropy is\nexactly one bit.\n", "  Information-theoretic definitions for the noise associated with a quantum\nmeasurement and the corresponding disturbance to the state of the system have\nrecently been introduced [F. Buscemi et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 050401\n(2014)]. These definitions are invariant under relabelling of measurement\noutcomes, and lend themselves readily to the formulation of state-independent\nuncertainty relations both for the joint estimate of observables (noise-noise\nrelations) and the noise-disturbance tradeoff. Here we derive such relations\nfor incompatible qubit observables, which we prove to be tight in the case of\njoint estimates, and present progress towards fully characterising the\nnoise-disturbance tradeoff. In doing so, we show that the set of obtainable\nnoise-noise values for such observables is convex, whereas the conjectured form\nfor the set of obtainable noise-disturbance values is not. Furthermore,\nprojective measurements are not optimal with respect to the joint-measurement\nnoise or noise-disturbance tradeoffs. Interestingly, it seems that four-outcome\nmeasurements are needed in the former case, whereas three-outcome measurements\nare optimal in the latter.\n", "  Lorentz symmetry violations can be parametrized by an effective field theory\nframework that contains both general relativity and the standard model of\nparticle physics called the standard-model extension (SME). We present new\nconstraints on pure gravity SME coefficients obtained by analyzing lunar laser\nranging (LLR) observations. We use a new numerical lunar ephemeris computed in\nthe SME framework and we perform a LLR data analysis using a set of 20721\nnormal points covering the period of August, 1969 to December, 2013. We\nemphasize that linear combination of SME coefficients to which LLR data are\nsensitive and not the same as those fitted in previous postfit residuals\nanalysis using LLR observations and based on theoretical grounds. We found no\nevidence for Lorentz violation at the level of $10^{-8}$ for $\\bar{s}^{TX}$,\n$10^{-12}$ for $\\bar{s}^{XY}$ and $\\bar{s}^{XZ}$, $10^{-11}$ for\n$\\bar{s}^{XX}-\\bar{s}^{YY}$ and\n$\\bar{s}^{XX}+\\bar{s}^{YY}-2\\bar{s}^{ZZ}-4.5\\bar{s}^{YZ}$ and $10^{-9}$ for\n$\\bar{s}^{TY}+0.43\\bar{s}^{TZ}$. We improve previous constraints on SME\ncoefficient by a factor up to 5 and 800 compared to postfit residuals analysis\nof respectively binary pulsars and LLR observations.\n", "  Much of transiting exoplanet science relies on high-precision photometry. The\ncurrent generation of instruments can exhibit sensitivity variations greater\nthan the astrophysical signals. For the InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) on the\nSpitzer Space Telescope, a popular way to handle this is\nBiLinearly-Interpolated Subpixel Sensitivity (BLISS) mapping. As part of a\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), BLISS mapping estimates the sensitivity at\nmany locations (knots) on the pixel, then interpolates to the target star's\ncentroids. We show that such embedded optimization schemes can misfit or bias\nparameters. Thus, we construct a model of $\\textit{Spitzer}$ eclipse light\ncurves to test the accuracy and precision of BLISS mapping. We compare standard\nBLISS mapping to a variant where the knots are fit during the MCMC, as well as\nto a polynomial model. Both types of BLISS mapping give similar eclipse depths,\nand we find that standard knots behave like real parameters. Standard BLISS\nmapping is therefore a reasonable shortcut to fitting for knots in an MCMC.\nBLISS maps become inaccurate when the photon noise is low, but typically\napproximate the real sensitivity well. We also find there is no perfect method\nfor choosing the ideal number of BLISS knots to use on given data. BLISS\nmapping gives fits that are usually more accurate than precise (i.e. they are\noverly conservative), and the routine is more precise than polynomial models\nfor significant eclipses or pixels with more varied sensitivities. BLISS\nmapping has better predictive power for most of these particular synthetic\ndata, depending on how one treats time-correlated residuals. Overall, we\nconclude that BLISS mapping can be a reasonable sensitivity model for IRAC\nphotometry.\n", "  In this communication we present the first experimental results obtained on\nthe Crossed-cubes nuller (CCN), that is a new type of Achromatic phase shifter\n(APS) based on a pair of crossed beamsplitter cubes. We review the general\nprinciple of the CCN, now restricted to two interferometric outputs for\nachieving better performance, and describe the experimental apparatus developed\nin our laboratory. It is cheap, compact, and easy to align. The results\ndemonstrate a high extinction rate in monochromatic light and confirm that the\ndevice is insensitive to its polarization state. Finally, the first lessons\nfrom the experiment are summarized and discussed in view of future space\nmissions searching for extra-solar planets located in the habitable zone,\neither based on a coronagraphic telescope or a sparse-aperture nulling\ninterferometer\n", "  MICADO will equip the E-ELT with a first light capability for diffraction\nlimited imaging at near-infrared wavelengths. The instrument's observing modes\nfocus on various flavours of imaging, including astrometric, high contrast, and\ntime resolved. There is also a single object spectroscopic mode optimised for\nwavelength coverage at moderately high resolution. This contribution provides\nan overview of the key functionality of the instrument, outlining the\nscientific rationale for its observing modes. The interface between MICADO and\nthe adaptive optics system MAORY that feeds it is summarised. The design of the\ninstrument is discussed, focussing on the optics and mechanisms inside the\ncryostat, together with a brief overview of the other key sub-systems.\n", "  Complex networks have been widely used in science and technology because of\ntheir ability to represent several systems. One of these systems is found in\nBiochemistry, in which the synthesis of new nanoparticles is a hot topic.\nHowever, the interpretation of experimental results in the search of new\nnanoparticles poses several challenges. This is due to the characteristics of\nnanoparticles images and due to their multiple intricate properties; one\nproperty of recurrent interest is the agglomeration of particles. Addressing\nthis issue, this paper introduces an approach that uses complex networks to\ndetect and describe nanoparticle agglomerates so to foster easier and more\ninsightful analyses. In this approach, each detected particle in an image\ncorresponds to a vertice and the distances between the particles define a\ncriterion for creating edges. Edges are created if the distance is smaller than\na radius of interest. Once this network is set, we calculate several discrete\nmeasures able to reveal the most outstanding agglomerates in a nanoparticle\nimage. Experimental results using images of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM)\nof gold nanoparticles demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach\nover several samples, as reflected by the separability between particles in\nthree usual settings. The results also demonstrated efficacy for both convex\nand non-convex agglomerates.\n", "  Multi-object or integral field spectrographs are recognized techniques for\nachieving simultaneous spectroscopic observations of different or extended sky\nobjects with a high multiplex factor. In this communication is described a\ncomplementary approach for realizing similar measurements under different\nspectral resolutions at the same time. We describe the basic principle of this\nnew type of spectrometer, that is based on the utilization of an optical pupil\nslicer. An optical design inspired from an already studied instrument is then\npresented and commented for the sake of illustration. Technical issues about\nthe pupil slicer and diffractive components are also discussed. We finally\nconclude on the potential advantages and drawbacks of the proposed system.\n", "  MATISSE represents a great opportunity to image the environment around\nmassive and evolved stars. This will allow one to put constraints on the\ncircumstellar structure, on the mass ejection of dust and its reorganization ,\nand on the dust-nature and formation processes. MATISSE measurements will often\nbe pivotal for the understanding of large multiwavelength datasets on the same\ntargets collected through many high-angular resolution facilities at ESO like\nsub-millimeter interferometry (ALMA), near-infrared adaptive optics (NACO,\nSPHERE), interferometry (PIONIER, GRAVITY), spectroscopy (CRIRES), and\nmid-infrared imaging (VISIR). Among main sequence and evolved stars, several\ncases of interest have been identified that we describe in this paper.\n", "  We describe the redmonster automated redshift measurement and spectral\nclassification software designed for the extended Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV). We\ndescribe the algorithms, the template standard and requirements, and the newly\ndeveloped galaxy templates to be used on eBOSS spectra. We present results from\ntesting on early data from eBOSS, where we have found a 90.5% automated\nredshift and spectral classification success rate for the luminous red galaxy\nsample (redshifts 0.6$\\lesssim z \\lesssim$1.0). The redmonster performance\nmeets the eBOSS cosmology requirements for redshift classification and\ncatastrophic failures, and represents a significant improvement over the\nprevious pipeline. We describe the empirical processes used to determine the\noptimum number of additive polynomial terms in our models and an acceptable\n$\\Delta\\chi_r^2$ threshold for declaring statistical confidence. Statistical\nerrors on redshift measurement due to photon shot noise are assessed, and we\nfind typical values of a few tens of km s$^{-1}$. An investigation of redshift\ndifferences in repeat observations scaled by error estimates yields a\ndistribution with a Gaussian mean and standard deviation of $\\mu\\sim$0.01 and\n$\\sigma\\sim$0.65, respectively, suggesting the reported statistical redshift\nuncertainties are over-estimated by $\\sim$54%. We assess the effects of object\nmagnitude, signal-to-noise ratio, fiber number, and fiber head location on the\npipeline's redshift success rate. Finally, we describe directions of ongoing\ndevelopment.\n", "  We have studied the role of spin-dependent processes on conductivity in\npolyfluorene (PFO) thin films by conducting continuous wave (c.w.) electrically\ndetected magnetic resonance (EDMR) spectroscopy at temperatures between 10 K\nand 293 K using microwave frequencies between about 100 MHz and 20 GHz as well\nas pulsed EDMR at X-band. Variable frequency EDMR allows us to establish the\nrole of spin-orbit coupling in spin-dependent processes, pulsed EDMR probes\ncoherent spin motion effects. We used PFO for this study in order to allow for\nthe investigation of the effects of microscopic morphological ordering since\nthis material can adopt two distinct intrachain morphologies: an amorphous\n(glassy) phase, and an ordered (beta) phase. In thin films of organic\nlight-emitting diodes (OLEDs) the appearance of a particular phase can be\ncontrolled by deposition parameters, and is verified by electroluminescence\nspectroscopy. We conducted multi-frequency c.w. EDMR, electrically detected\nRabi spinbeat experiments, Hahn-echo and inversion-recovery measurements.\nCoherent echo spectroscopy reveals electrically detected electron spin-echo\nenvelope modulation (ESEEM) due to the precession of the carrier spins around\nthe protons. Our results demonstrate that while conformational disorder can\ninfluence the observed EDMR signals, including the sign of the current changes\non resonance as well as the magnitudes of local hyperfine fields and charge\ncarrier spin-orbit interactions, it does not qualitatively affect the nature of\nspin-dependent transitions in this material. At 293 K and 10 K, polaron-pair\nrecombination through weakly spin-spin coupled intermediate charge carrier pair\nstates is dominant, while at low temperatures, additional signatures of\nspin-dependent charge transport through the interaction of polarons with\ntriplet excitons are seen in the half-field resonance of a triplet spin-1\nspecies.\n", "  We show how the interplay between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and merger\nhistory determines whether a galaxy quenches star formation at high redshift.\nWe first simulate, in a full cosmological context, a galaxy of total dynamical\nmass $10^{12}\\,M_{\\odot}$ at $z=2$. Then we systematically alter the accretion\nhistory of the galaxy by minimally changing the linear overdensity in the\ninitial conditions. This \"genetic modification\" approach allows the generation\nof three sets of $\\Lambda$CDM initial conditions leading to maximum merger\nratios of 1:10, 1:5 and 2:3 respectively. The changes leave the final halo\nmass, large scale structure and local environment unchanged, providing a\ncontrolled numerical experiment. Interaction between the AGN physics and\nmergers in the three cases lead respectively to a star-forming,\ntemporarily-quenched and permanently-quenched galaxy. However the differences\ndo not primarily lie in the black hole accretion rates, but in the kinetic\neffects of the merger: the galaxy is resilient against AGN feedback unless its\ngaseous disk is first disrupted. Typical accretion rates are comparable in the\nthree cases, falling below $0.1\\,M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, equivalent to around\n$2\\%$ of the Eddington rate or $10^{-3}$ times the pre-quenching star formation\nrate, in agreement with observations. This low level of black hole accretion\ncan be sustained even when there is insufficient dense cold gas for star\nformation. Conversely, supernova feedback is too distributed to generate\noutflows in high-mass systems, and cannot maintain quenching over periods\nlonger than the halo gas cooling time.\n", "  We report interferometric measurements of [NII] 205 um fine-structure line\nemission from a representative sample of three galaxies at z=5-6 using the\nAtacama Large (sub)Millimeter Array (ALMA). These galaxies were previously\ndetected in [CII] and far-infrared continuum emission and span almost two\norders of magnitude in star formation rate (SFR). Our results show at least two\ndifferent regimes of ionized inter-stellar medium properties for galaxies in\nthe first billion years of cosmic time, separated by their L_[CII]/L_[NII]\nratio. We find extremely low [NII] emission compared to [CII] (L_\n[CII]/L_[NII]=68 [+200/-28]) from a \"typical\" L*_UV star-forming galaxy, likely\ndirectly or indirectly (by its effect on the radiation field) related to low\ndust abundance and low metallicity. The infrared-luminous modestly star-forming\nLyman Break Galaxy (LBG) in our sample is characterized by an ionized-gas\nfraction (L_[CII]/L_[NII]<=20) typical of local star-forming galaxies and shows\nevidence for spatial variations in its ionized-gas fraction across an extended\ngas reservoir. The extreme SFR, warm and compact dusty starburst AzTEC-3 shows\nan ionized fraction higher than expected given its star-formation rate surface\ndensity (L_[CII]/L_[NII]=22+/-8) suggesting that [NII] dominantly traces a\ndiffuse ionized medium rather than star-forming HII regions in this type of\ngalaxy. This highest redshift sample of [NII] detections provides some of the\nfirst constraints on ionized and neutral gas modeling attempts and on the\nstructure of the inter-stellar medium at z=5-6 in \"normal\" galaxies and\nstarbursts.\n", "  BlackGEM (BG) is an array of telescopes, currently under development at the\nRadboud University Nijmegen and at NOVA. It targets the detection of the\noptical counterparts of gravitational waves. The first 3 BG telescopes are\nplanned to be installed in 2018 at the La Silla observatory. A single prototype\ntelescope, named MeerLICHT, will already be commissioned early 2017 in\nSutherland to provide an optical complement for the MeerKAT radio array. The BG\narray consists of, initially, a set of 3 robotic 65-cm wide-field telescopes.\nEach telescope is equipped with a single STA1600 CCD detector with 10.5k x\n10.5k 9-mum pixels that covers a 2.7 square degrees field of view. The\ncryostats for housing these detectors are developed and built at the KU Leuven\nUniversity. The operational model of BG requires long periods of reliable\nands-off operation. Therefore, we designed the cryostats for long vacuum hold\ntime and we make use of a closed-cycle cooling system, based on Polycold PCC\nJoule-Thomson coolers. A single programmable logic controller (PLC) controls\nthe cryogenic systems of several BG telescopes simultaneously, resulting in a\nhighly reliable, cost-efficient and maintenance-friendly system. PLC-based\ncryostat control offers some distinct advantages, especially for a robotic\nfacility. Apart of temperature monitoring and control, the PLC also monitors\nthe vacuum quality, the power supply and the status of the PCC coolers\n(compressor power consumption and temperature, pressure in the gas lines,\netc.). Furthermore, it provides an alarming system and safe and reproducible\nprocedures for automatic cool down and warm up. The communication between PLC\nand higher-level software takes place via the OPC-UA protocol, offering a\nsimple to implement, yet very powerful interface. Finally, a touch-panel\ndisplay on the PLC provides the operator with a user-friendly and robust\ntechnical interface.\n", "  There is growing evidence that the superconducting semimetal FeSe ($T_c\\sim8$\nK) is in the crossover regime between weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer\n(BCS) and strong-coupling Bose-Einstein-condensate (BEC) limits. We report on\nlongitudinal and transverse thermal conductivities, $\\kappa_{xx}$ and\n$\\kappa_{xy}$, respectively, in magnetic fields up to 20 T. The field\ndependences of $\\kappa_{xx}$ and $\\kappa_{xy}$ imply that a highly anisotropic\nsmall superconducting gap forms at the electron Fermi-surface pocket whereas a\nmore isotropic and larger gap forms at the hole pocket. Below $\\sim1.0$ K, both\n$\\kappa_{xx}$ and $\\kappa_{xy}$ exhibit distinct anomalies (kinks) at the upper\ncritical field $H_{c2}$ and at a field $H^*$ slightly below $H_{c2}$. The\nanalysis of the thermal Hall angle ($\\kappa_{xy}/\\kappa_{xx}$) indicates a\nchange of the quasiparticle scattering rate at $H^*$. These results provide\nstrong support to the previous suggestion that above $H^*$ a distinct\nfield-induced superconducting phase emerges with an unprecedented large spin\nimbalance.\n", "  Optical imaging with microarcsecond resolution will reveal details across and\noutside stellar surfaces but requires kilometer-scale interferometers,\nchallenging to realize either on the ground or in space. Intensity\ninterferometry, electronically connecting independent telescopes, has a noise\nbudget that relates to the electronic time resolution, circumventing issues of\natmospheric turbulence. Extents up to a few km are becoming realistic with\narrays of optical air Cherenkov telescopes (primarily erected for gamma-ray\nstudies), enabling an optical equivalent of radio interferometer arrays.\nPioneered by Hanbury Brown and Twiss, digital versions of the technique have\nnow been demonstrated, reconstructing diffraction-limited images from\nlaboratory measurements over hundreds of optical baselines. This review\noutlines the method from its beginnings, describes current experiments, and\nsketches prospects for future observations.\n", "  Ionization-recombination balance in dense interstellar and circumstellar\nenvironments is a key factor for a variety of important physical processes,\nsuch as chemical reactions, dust charging and coagulation, coupling of the gas\nwith magnetic field and development of instabilities in protoplanetary disks.\nWe determine a critical gas density above which the recombination of electrons\nand ions on the grain surface dominates over the gas-phase recombination. For\nthis regime, we present a self-consistent analytical model which allows us to\nexactly calculate abundances of charged species in dusty gas, without making\nassumptions on the grain charge distribution. To demonstrate the importance of\nthe proposed approach, we check whether the conventional approximation of low\ngrain charges is valid for typical protoplanetary disks, and discuss the\nimplications for dust coagulation and development of the \"dead zone\" in the\ndisk. The presented model is applicable for arbitrary grain-size distributions\nand, for given dust properties and conditions of the disk, has only one free\nparameter - the effective mass of the ions, shown to have a low effect on\nresults. The model can be easily included in numerical simulations following\nthe dust evolution in dense molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks.\n", "  SOXS (Son Of X-Shooter) will be a unique spectroscopic facility for the\nESO-NTT 3.5-m telescope in La Silla (Chile), able to cover the optical/NIR band\n(350-1750 nm). The design foresees a high-efficiency spectrograph with a\nresolution-slit product of ~4,500, capable of simultaneously observing the\ncomplete spectral range 350 - 1750 nm with a good sensitivity, with light\nimaging capabilities in the visible band. This paper outlines the status of the\nproject.\n", "  We show that the angular momentum exchange mechanism governing the evolution\nof mass transferring binary stars does not apply to Roche-lobe filling planets,\nbecause most of the angular momentum of the mass transferring stream is\nabsorbed by the host star. Apart from a correction for the difference in\nspecific angular momentum of the stream and the centre of mass of the planet,\nthe orbit does not expand much on Roche-lobe overflow. We explore the\nconditions for dynamically unstable Roche-lobe overflow as a function of planet\nmass and mass and radius (age) of host star and equation of state of planet.\nFor a Sun-like host, gas giant planets in a range of mass and entropy can\nundergo dynamical mass transfer. Examples of the evolution of the mass transfer\nprocess are given. Dynamic mass transfer of rocky planets depend somewhat\nsensitively on equation of state used. Silicate planets in the range $1\nM_{\\oplus} <M_{\\mathrm{p}} < 10 M_{\\oplus} $ typically go through a phase of\ndynamical mass transfer before settling to slow overflow when their mass drops\nto less than $1 M_{\\oplus}$.\n", "  The heavy fermion material CeB6 shows hidden magnetic ordered phases. Besides\nwell-known Ferromagnetic(FM) and Antiferromagnetic(AFM) phases, CeB6 is\nspeculated to form a unique antiferroquadrupolar (AFQ) phase that is orbital in\nnature. Hidden from many characterization methods that cannot assess orbital\nordering, debate continue on the origins. From electronic-structure\ncalculations, we find that these three phases are energetically almost\ndegenerate, suggesting that magnetic domain walls form, possibly with defect\nboundaries. Only calculations with spin-orbit coupling reproduce most band\nstructures and Fermi surfaces, as found in experiment, indicating the\nimportance of crystal-field splitting. Simulated ionization peaks, i.e., Ce f0\nand f1 states, also agree with photoemission data. Small pressures stabilizes\nthe AFM over the FM phase, which is the observed phase at low temperature. We\npropose to realize such small physical pressure under various situations e.g.\neffect of intrinsic defects such as vacancies, antisites, surface effects etc.\n", "  We apply a soft-wall AdS/QCD approach to the description of deuteron\nstructure functions and tensor polarized properties. Present work is a\ncompletion of our previous study on electromagnetic form factors. By the\nappropriate choice of two couplings in the effective action we are able to\nreproduce both the form factors and structure functions in full consistency\nwith model-independent constraints set by perturbative QCD. Our framework is\nbased on a five-dimensional action in AdS space formulated in terms of vector\nfields dual to the deuteron and the electromagnetic fields. The AdS fields\ndepend on four Minkowski and one holographic coordinate $z$. The scale\ndependence of the form factors and structure functions is consistent with quark\ncounting rules implying the $1/Q^{10}$ behavior of the charge form factor\n$G_C(Q^2)$, structure functions $A(Q^2)$ and $B(Q^2)$, and the $1/Q^{12}$\nbehavior of the magnetic $G_M(Q^2)$ and quadrupole $G_Q(Q^2)$ form factors.\n", "  We examine the relation between stellar mass and central stellar velocity\ndispersion-the M-sigma relation-for massive quiescent galaxies at z<0.7. We\nmeasure the local relation from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the\nintermediate redshift relation from the Smithsonian Hectospec Lensing Survey.\nBoth samples are highly complete (>85%) and we consistently measure the stellar\nmass and velocity dispersion for the two samples. The M-sigma relation and its\nscatter are independent of redshift with sigma ~ M^0.3 for M>10^10.3 M_solar.\nThe measured slope of the M-sigma relation is the same as the scaling between\nthe total halo mass and the dark matter halo velocity dispersion obtained by\nN-body simulations. This consistency suggests that massive quiescent galaxies\nare virialized systems where the central dark matter concentration is either a\nconstant or negligible fraction of the stellar mass. The relation between the\ntotal galaxy mass (stellar + dark matter) and the central stellar velocity\ndispersion is consistent with the observed relation between the total mass of a\ngalaxy cluster and the velocity dispersion of the cluster members. This result\nsuggests that the central stellar velocity dispersion is directly proportional\nto the velocity dispersion of the dark matter halo. Thus the central stellar\nvelocity dispersion is a fundamental, directly observable property of galaxies\nthat may robustly connect galaxies to dark matter halos in N-body simulations.\nTo interpret the results further in the context of Lambda-CDM, it would be\nuseful to analyze the relationship between the velocity dispersion of stellar\nparticles and the velocity dispersion characterizing their dark matter halos in\nhigh-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations.\n", "  The \"torus\" is the central element of the most popular theory unifying\nvarious classes of AGNs, but it is usually described as \"putative\" because it\nhas not been imaged yet. Since it is too small to be resolved with single-dish\ntelescopes, one can only make indirect assumptions about its structure using\nmodels. Using infrared interferometry, however, we were able to resolve the\ncircum-nuclear dust distributions for several nearby AGNs and achieved\nconstraints on some further two dozen sources. We discovered circum-nuclear\ndust on parsec scales in all sources and, in two nearby sources, were able to\ndissect this dust into two distinct components. The compact component, a very\nthin disk, appears to be connected to the maser disk and the extended one,\nwhich is responsible for most of the mid-IR flux, is oriented perpendicularly\nto the circum-nuclear gas disks. What may come as a surprise when having in\nmind the standard unification cartoon actually connects well to observations on\nlarger scales. Optically thin dust in the polar region, perhaps driven by a\ndisk wind, could solve both the scale height problem of the torus and explain\nthe missing anisotropy in the mid-IR - X-ray relation.\n", "  We present the MAssive ClusterS and Intercluster Structures (MACSIS) project,\na suite of 390 clusters simulated with baryonic physics that yields realistic\nmassive galaxy clusters capable of matching a wide range of observed\nproperties. MACSIS extends the recent BAHAMAS simulation to higher masses,\nenabling robust predictions for the redshift evolution of cluster properties\nand an assessment of the effect of selecting only the hottest systems. We study\nthe observable-mass scaling relations and the X-ray luminosity-temperature\nrelation over the complete observed cluster mass range. As expected, we find\nthe slope of these scaling relations and the evolution of their normalization\nwith redshift departs significantly from the self-similar predictions. However,\nfor a sample of hot clusters with core-excised temperatures\n$k_{\\rm{B}}T\\geq5\\,\\rm{keV}$ the normalization and slope of the observable-mass\nrelations and their evolution are significantly closer to self-similar. The\nexception is the temperature-mass relation, for which the increased importance\nof non-thermal pressure support and biased X-ray temperatures leads to a\ngreater departure from self-similarity in the hottest systems. As a\nconsequence, these also affect the slope and evolution of the normalization in\nthe luminosity-temperature relation. The median hot gas profiles show good\nagreement with observational data at $z=0$ and $z=1$, with their evolution\nagain departing significantly from the self-similar prediction. However,\nselecting a hot sample of clusters yields profiles that evolve significantly\ncloser to the self-similar prediction. In conclusion, our results show that\nunderstanding the selection function is vital for robust calibration of cluster\nproperties with mass and redshift.\n", "  Dust trapping accelerates the coagulation of dust particles, and thus it\nrepresents an initial step toward the formation of planetesimals. We report\n$H$-band (1.6 um) linear polarimetric observations and 0.87 mm interferometric\ncontinuum observations toward a transitional disk around LkHa 330. As results,\na pair of spiral arms were detected in the $H$-band emission and an asymmetric\n(potentially arm-like) structure was detected in the 0.87 mm continuum\nemission. We discuss the origin of the spiral arm and the asymmetric structure,\nand suggest that a massive unseen planet is the most plausible explanation. The\npossibility of dust trapping and grain growth causing the asymmetric structure\nwas also investigated through the opacity index (beta) by plotting the observed\nSED slope between 0.87 mm from our SMA observation and 1.3 mm from literature.\nThe results imply that grains are indistinguishable from ISM-like dust in the\neast side ($beta = 2.0 pm 0.5$), but much smaller in the west side $beta =\n0.7^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$, indicating differential dust size distribution between the\ntwo sides of the disk. Combining the results of near-infrared and submillimeter\nobservations, we conjecture that the spiral arms exist at the upper surface and\nan asymmetric structure resides in the disk interior. Future observations at\ncentimeter wavelengths and differential polarization imaging in other bands (Y\nto K) with extreme AO imagers are required to understand how large dust grains\nform and to further explore the dust distribution in the disk.\n", "  For several years, we have been developing vortex phase masks based on\nsub-wavelength gratings, known as Annular Groove Phase Masks. Etched onto\ndiamond substrates, these AGPMs are currently designed to be used in the\nthermal infrared (ranging from 3 to 13 {\\mu}m). Our AGPMs were first installed\non VLT/NACO and VLT/VISIR in 2012, followed by LBT/LMIRCam in 2013 and\nKeck/NIRC2 in 2015. In this paper, we review the development, commissioning,\non-sky performance, and early scientific results of these new coronagraphic\nmodes and report on the lessons learned. We conclude with perspectives for\nfuture developments and applications.\n", "  In this paper we describe a new integration method for the groups $U(N)$ and\n$SU(N)$, for which we verified numerically that it is polynomially exact for\n$N\\le 3$. The method is applied to the example of 1-dimensional QCD with a\nchemical potential. We explore, in particular, regions of the parameter space\nin which the sign problem appears due the presence of the chemical potential.\nWhile Markov Chain Monte Carlo fails in this region, our new integration method\nstill provides results for the chiral condensate on arbitrary precision,\ndemonstrating clearly that it overcomes the sign problem. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that our new method leads to orders of magnitude reduced errors\nalso in other regions of parameter space.\n", "  Correlations between intrinsic galaxy shapes on large-scales arise due to the\neffect of the tidal field of the large-scale structure. Anisotropic primordial\nnon-Gaussianity induces a distinct scale-dependent imprint in these tidal\nalignments on large scales. Motivated by the observational finding that the\nalignment strength of luminous red galaxies depends on how galaxy shapes are\nmeasured, we study the use of two different shape estimators as a multi-tracer\nprobe of intrinsic alignments. We show, by means of a Fisher analysis, that\nthis technique promises a significant improvement on anisotropic\nnon-Gaussianity constraints over a single-tracer method. For future weak\nlensing surveys, the uncertainty in the anisotropic non-Gaussianity parameter,\n$A_2$, is forecast to be $\\sigma(A_2)\\approx 50$, $\\sim 40\\%$ smaller than\ncurrently available constraints from the bispectrum of the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground. This corresponds to an improvement of a factor of $4-5$ over the\nuncertainty from a single-tracer analysis.\n", "  The dissipative dynamics of an expanding massless gas with constant cross\nsection in a spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW)\nuniverse is studied. The mathematical problem of solving the full nonlinear\nrelativistic Boltzmann equation is recast into an infinite set of nonlinear\nordinary differential equations for the moments of the one-particle\ndistribution function. Momentum-space resolution is determined by the number of\nnon-hydrodynamic modes included in the moment hierarchy, i.e., by the\ntruncation order. We show that in the FLRW spacetime the non-hydrodynamic modes\ndecouple completely from the hydrodynamic degrees of freedom. This results in\nthe system flowing as an ideal fluid while at the same time producing entropy.\nThe solutions to the nonlinear Boltzmann equation exhibit transient tails of\nthe distribution function with nontrivial momentum dependence. The evolution of\nthis tail is not correctly captured by the relaxation time approximation nor by\nthe linearized Boltzmann equation. However, the latter probes additional\nhigh-momentum details unresolved by the relaxation time approximation. While\nthe expansion of the FLRW spacetime is slow enough for the system to move\ntowards (and not away from) local thermal equilibrium, it is not sufficiently\nslow for the system to actually ever reach complete local equilibrium.\nEquilibration is fastest in the relaxation time approximation, followed, in\nturn, by kinetic evolution with a linearized and a fully nonlinear Boltzmann\ncollision term.\n", "  We describe a detailed radial velocity error budget for the NASA-NSF Extreme\nPrecision Doppler Spectrometer instrument concept NEID (NN-explore Exoplanet\nInvestigations with Doppler spectroscopy). Such an instrument performance\nbudget is a necessity for both identifying the variety of noise sources\ncurrently limiting Doppler measurements, and estimating the achievable\nperformance of next generation exoplanet hunting Doppler spectrometers. For\nthese instruments, no single source of instrumental error is expected to set\nthe overall measurement floor. Rather, the overall instrumental measurement\nprecision is set by the contribution of many individual error sources. We use a\ncombination of numerical simulations, educated estimates based on published\nmaterials, extrapolations of physical models, results from laboratory\nmeasurements of spectroscopic subsystems, and informed upper limits for a\nvariety of error sources to identify likely sources of systematic error and\nconstruct our global instrument performance error budget. While natively\nfocused on the performance of the NEID instrument, this modular performance\nbudget is immediately adaptable to a number of current and future instruments.\nSuch an approach is an important step in charting a path towards improving\nDoppler measurement precisions to the levels necessary for discovering\nEarth-like planets.\n", "  In recent years spiral structures have been seen in scattered light\nobservations and signs of vortices in millimeter images of protoplanetary\ndisks, both probably linked with the presence of planets. We present ALMA Band\n7 (335 GHz or 0.89 mm) continuum observations of the transition disk HD135344B\nat unprecedented spatial resolution of 0.16\", using superuniform weighting. The\ndata show that the asymmetric millimeter dust ring seen in previous work\nactually consists of an inner ring and an outer asymmetric structure. The outer\nfeature is cospatial with the end of one of the spiral arms seen in scattered\nlight, but the feature itself is not consistent with a spiral arm due to its\ncoradiance. We propose a new possible scenario to explain the observed\nstructures at both wavelengths. Hydrodynamical simulations show that a massive\nplanet can generate a primary vortex (which dissipates at longer timescales,\nbecoming an axisymmetric ring) and trigger the formation of a second generation\nvortex further out. Within this scenario the two spiral arms observed at\nscattered light originate from a planet at ~30 AU and from the secondary vortex\nat ~75 AU rather than a planet further out as previously reported.\n", "  Remote investigations of the ancient solar system matter has been\ntraditionally carried out through the observations of long-period (LP) comets\nthat are less affected by solar irradiation than the short-period counterparts\norbiting much closer to the Sun. Here we summarize the results of our\ndecade-long survey of the distant activity of LP comets. We found that the most\nimportant separation in the dataset is based on the dynamical nature of the\nobjects. Dynamically new comets are characterized by a higher level of activity\non average: the most active new comets in our sample can be characterized by\nafrho values >3--4 higher than that of our most active returning comets. New\ncomets develop more symmetric comae, suggesting a generally isotropic outflow.\nContrary to this, the coma of recurrent comets can be less symmetrical,\nocassionally exhibiting negative slope parameters, suggesting sudden variations\nin matter production. The morphological appearance of the observed comets is\nrather diverse. A surprisingly large fraction of the comets have long, teniouos\ntails, but the presence of impressive tails does not show a clear correlation\nwith the brightness of the comets.\n", "  We study the correlation of galaxy structural properties with their location\nrelative to the SFR-M* correlation, also known as the star formation \"main\nsequence\" (SFMS), in the CANDELS and GAMA surveys and in a semi-analytic model\n(SAM) of galaxy formation. We first study the distribution of median Sersic\nindex, effective radius, star formation rate (SFR) density and stellar mass\ndensity in the SFR-M* plane. We then define a redshift dependent main sequence\nand examine the medians of these quantities as a function of distance from this\nmain sequence, both above (higher SFRs) and below (lower SFRs). Finally, we\nexamine the distributions of distance from the main sequence in bins of these\nquantities. We find strong correlations between all of these galaxy structural\nproperties and the distance from the SFMS, such that as we move from galaxies\nabove the SFMS to those below it, we see a nearly monotonic trend towards\nhigher median Sersic index, smaller radius, lower SFR density, and higher\nstellar density. In the semi-analytic model, bulge growth is driven by mergers\nand disk instabilities, and is accompanied by the growth of a supermassive\nblack hole which can regulate or quench star formation via Active Galactic\nNucleus (AGN) feedback. We find that our model qualitatively reproduces the\ntrends described above, supporting a picture in which black holes and bulges\nco-evolve, and AGN feedback plays a critical role in moving galaxies off of the\nSFMS.\n", "  We consider dark matter physics in a model for the dark sector with extra\ndark U(1)$_X$ gauge symmetry. The dark sector is composed of exotic fermions\nthat are charged under both dark U(1)$_X$ and the standard model SU(3)$_C\n\\times$U(1)$_Y$ gauge groups, as well as standard model singlet complex scalars\n$\\Phi$ and $X$ with nonzero U(1)$_X$ charge. In this model, there are two dark\nmatter candidates$-$a scalar and a fermion$-$both of which are stabilized by\naccidental $Z_2$ symmetry. Their thermal relic density, and direct and indirect\ndetection constraints are discussed in detail and we search for the parameter\nspace of the model accommodating dark matter observations. We also discuss\nconstraints from diphoton resonance searches associated with the scalar field\nwhich breaks the dark U(1)$_X$, in a way consistent with dark matter physics.\nIn addition, implications for collider physics are discussed, focusing on the\nproduction cross section of the scalar boson.\n", "  We investigate anew the distribution of absolute carbon abundance, $A$(C) $=\n\\log\\,\\epsilon $(C), for carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars in the halo of\nthe Milky Way, based on high-resolution spectroscopic data for a total sample\nof 305 CEMP stars. The sample includes 147 CEMP-$s$ (and CEMP-r/s) stars, 127\nCEMP-no stars, and 31 CEMP stars that are unclassified, based on the currently\nemployed [Ba/Fe] criterion. We confirm previous claims that the distribution of\n$A$(C) for CEMP stars is (at least) bimodal, with newly determined peaks\ncentered on $A$(C)$=7.96$ (the high-C region) and $A$(C)$ =6.28$ (the low-C\nregion). A very high fraction of CEMP-$s$ (and CEMP-r/s) stars belong to the\nhigh-C region, while the great majority of CEMP-no stars reside in the low-C\nregion. However, there exists complexity in the morphology of the $A$(C)-[Fe/H]\nspace for the CEMP-no stars, a first indication that more than one class of\nfirst-generation stellar progenitors may be required to account for their\nobserved abundances. The two groups of CEMP-no stars we identify exhibit\nclearly different locations in the $A$(Na)-$A$(C) and $A$(Mg)-$A$(C) spaces,\nalso suggesting multiple progenitors. The clear distinction in $A$(C) between\nthe CEMP-$s$ (and CEMP-$r/s$) stars and the CEMP-no stars appears to be $as\\\nsuccessful$, and $likely\\ more\\ astrophysically\\ fundamental$, for the\nseparation of these sub-classes as the previously recommended criterion based\non [Ba/Fe] (and [Ba/Eu]) abundance ratios. This result opens the window for its\napplication to present and future large-scale low- and medium-resolution\nspectroscopic surveys.\n", "  We simulate a one dimensional fermionic optical lattice to analyse heating\ndue to non-adiabatic lattice loading. Our simulations reveal that, similar to\nthe bosonic case, density redistribution effects are the major cause of heating\nin harmonic traps. We suggest protocols to modulate the local density\ndistribution during the process of lattice loading, in order to reduce the\nexcess energy. Our numerical results confirm that linear interpolation of the\ntrapping potential and/or the interaction strength is an efficient method of\ndoing so, bearing practical applications relevant to experiments.\n", "  We show that any {\\em quasi-particle} or GW approximation to the self-energy\ndoes not capture excitonic features in time-resolved (TR) photoemission\nspectroscopy. In this work we put forward a first-principles approach and\npropose a feasible diagrammatic approximation to solve this problem. We also\nderive an alternative formula for the TR photocurrent which involves a single\ntime-integral of the lesser Green's function. The diagrammatic approximation\napplies to the {\\em relaxed} regime characterized by the presence of\nquasi-stationary excitons and vanishing polarization. The main distinctive\nfeature of the theory is that the diagrams must be evaluated using {\\em\nexcited} Green's functions. As this is not standard the analytic derivation is\npresented in detail. The final result is an expression for the lesser Green's\nfunction in terms of quantities that can all be calculated {\\em ab initio}. The\nvalidity of the proposed theory is illustrated in a one-dimensional model\nsystem with a direct gap. We discuss possible scenarios and highlight some\nuniversal features of the exciton peaks. Our results indicate that the exciton\ndispersion can be observed in TR {\\em and} angle-resolved photoemission.\n", "  Quasar-driven outflows naturally account for the missing component of the\nextragalactic $\\gamma$-ray background through neutral pion production in\ninteractions between protons accelerated by the forward outflow shock and\ninterstellar protons. We study the simultaneous neutrino emission by the same\nprotons. We adopt outflow parameters that best fit the extragalactic\n$\\gamma$-ray background data and derive a cumulative neutrino background of\n$\\sim10^{-7}\\,\\rm GeV\\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}\\,sr^{-1}$ at neutrino energies\n$E_{\\nu}\\gtrsim 10$ TeV, which naturally explains the most recent IceCube data\nwithout tuning any free parameters. The link between the $\\gamma$-ray and\nneutrino emission from quasar outflows can be used to constrain the high-energy\nphysics of strong shocks at cosmological distances.\n", "  We perform three dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)\nsimulations of gas accretion onto the seeds of binary stars to investigate\ntheir short-term evolution. Our simulation setup is more realistic compared to\nthe previous works by taking into account of dynamically evolving envelope with\nnon-uniform distribution of gas density and angular momentum of accreting flow.\nOur initial condition includes a seed binary and a surrounding gas envelope,\nmodelling the phase of core collapse of gas cloud when the fragmentation has\nalready occurred. We assume that the seed binary has no eccentricity and no\ngrowth by gas accretion. The envelope is assumed to be an isothermal gas with\nno self-gravity. We run multiple simulations with different values of initial\nmass ratio $q_0$ (the ratio of secondary over primary mass) and gas\ntemperature, and find a critical value of $q_{\\rm c} = 0.25$ which\ndistinguishes the later evolution of mass ratio $q$ as a function of time. If\n$q_0$ >~ $q_{\\rm c}$, the secondary seed grows faster and $q$ increases\nmonotonically towards unity. If $q_0$ <~ $q_{\\rm c}$, on the other hand, the\nprimary seed grows faster and $q$ is lower than $q_0$ at the end of the\nsimulation. Based on our numerical results, we analytically calculate the\nlong-term evolution of the seed binary including the growth of binary by gas\naccretion. We find that the seed binary with $q_0$ >~ $q_{\\rm c}$ evolves\ntowards an equal-mass binary star, and that with $q_0$ <~ $q_{\\rm c}$ evolves\nto a binary with an extreme value of $q$. Binary separation is a monotonically\nincreasing function of time for any $q_0$, suggesting that the binary growth by\naccretion does not lead to the formation of close binaries.\n", "  Combining information from weak sources, such as known pulsars, for\ngravitational wave detection, is an attractive approach to improve detection\nefficiency. We propose an optimal statistic for a general ensemble of signals\nand apply it to an ensemble of known pulsars. Our method combines $\\mathcal\nF$-statistic values from individual pulsars using weights proportional to each\npulsar's expected optimal signal-to-noise ratio to improve the detection\nefficiency. We also point out that to detect at least one pulsar within an\nensemble, different thresholds should be designed for each source based on the\nexpected signal strength. The performance of our proposed detection statistic\nis demonstrated using simulated sources, with the assumption that all pulsars'\nellipticities belong to a common (yet unknown) distribution. Comparing with an\nequal-weight strategy and with individual source approaches, we show that the\nweighted-combination of all known pulsars, where weights are assigned based on\nthe pulsars' known information, such as sky location, frequency and distance,\nas well as the detector sensitivity, always provides a more sensitive detection\nstatistic.\n", "  The Visible Tunable Filter (VTF) is a narrowband tunable filter system for\nimaging spectroscopy and spectropolarimetry based. The instrument will be one\nof the first-light instruments of the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope that is\ncurrently under construction on Maui (Hawaii). The VTF is being developed by\nthe Kiepenheuer Institut fuer Sonnenphysik in Freiburg as a German contribution\nto the DKIST.\n  We perform end-to-end simulations of spectropolarimetric observations with\nthe VTF to verify the science requirements of the instrument. The instrument is\nsimulated with two Etalons, and with a single Etalon.\n  The clear aperture of the Etalons is 250 mm, corresponding to a field of view\nwith a diameter of 60 arcsec in the sky (42,000 km on the Sun). To model the\nlarge-scale figure errors we employ low-order Zernike polynomials (power and\nspherical aberration) with amplitudes of 2.5 nm RMS. We use an ideal\npolarization modulator with equal modulation coefficients of 3-1/2 for the\npolarization modulation\n  We synthesize Stokes profiles of two iron lines (630.15 nm and 630.25 nm) and\nfor the 854.2 nm line of calcium, for a range of magnetic field values and for\nseveral inclination angles. We estimated the photon noise on the basis of the\nDKIST and VTF transmission values, the atmospheric transmission and the\nspectral flux from the Sun.\n  For the Fe 630.25 nm line, we obtain a sensitivity of 20 G for the\nlongitudinal component and for 150 G for the transverse component, in agreement\nwith the science requirements for the VTF.\n", "  We present the rationale for and the observational description of ASPECS: The\nALMA SPECtroscopic Survey in the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (UDF), the\ncosmological deep field that has the deepest multi-wavelength data available.\nOur overarching goal is to obtain an unbiased census of molecular gas and dust\ncontinuum emission in high-redshift (z$>$0.5) galaxies. The $\\sim$1$'$ region\ncovered within the UDF was chosen to overlap with the deepest available imaging\nfrom HST. Our ALMA observations consist of full frequency scans in band 3\n(84-115 GHz) and band 6 (212-272 GHz) at approximately uniform line sensitivity\n($L'_{\\rm CO}\\sim$2$\\times$10$^{9}$ K km/s pc$^2$), and continuum noise levels\nof 3.8 $\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ and 12.7 $\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, respectively. The\nmolecular surveys cover the different rotational transitions of the CO\nmolecule, leading to essentially full redshift coverage. The [CII] emission\nline is also covered at redshifts $6.0<z<8.0$. We present a customized\nalgorithm to identify line candidates in the molecular line scans, and quantify\nour ability to recover artificial sources from our data. Based on whether\nmultiple CO lines are detected, and whether optical spectroscopic redshifts as\nwell as optical counterparts exist, we constrain the most likely line\nidentification. We report 10 (11) CO line candidates in the 3mm (1mm) band, and\nour statistical analysis shows that $<$4 of these (in each band) are likely\nspurious. Less than 1/3 of the total CO flux in the low-J CO line candidates\nare from sources that are not associated with an optical/NIR counterpart. We\nalso present continuum maps of both the band 3 and band 6 observations. The\ndata presented here form the basis of a number of dedicated studies that are\npresented in subsequent papers.\n", "  We present an analysis of a deep (1$\\sigma$=13 $\\mu$Jy) cosmological 1.2-mm\ncontinuum map based on ASPECS, the ALMA Spectroscopic Survey in the Hubble\nUltra Deep Field. In the 1 arcmin$^2$ covered by ASPECS we detect nine sources\nat $>3.5\\sigma$ significance at 1.2-mm. Our ALMA--selected sample has a median\nredshift of $z=1.6\\pm0.4$, with only one galaxy detected at z$>$2 within the\nsurvey area. This value is significantly lower than that found in millimeter\nsamples selected at a higher flux density cut-off and similar frequencies. Most\ngalaxies have specific star formation rates similar to that of main sequence\ngalaxies at the same epoch, and we find median values of stellar mass and star\nformation rates of $4.0\\times10^{10}\\ M_\\odot$ and $\\sim40~M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$,\nrespectively. Using the dust emission as a tracer for the ISM mass, we derive\ndepletion times that are typically longer than 300 Myr, and we find molecular\ngas fractions ranging from $\\sim$0.1 to 1.0. As noted by previous studies,\nthese values are lower than using CO--based ISM estimates by a factor $\\sim$2.\nThe 1\\,mm number counts (corrected for fidelity and completeness) are in\nagreement with previous studies that were typically restricted to brighter\nsources. With our individual detections only, we recover $55\\pm4\\%$ of the\nextragalactic background light (EBL) at 1.2 mm measured by the Planck\nsatellite, and we recover $80\\pm7\\%$ of this EBL if we include the bright end\nof the number counts and additional detections from stacking. The stacked\ncontribution is dominated by galaxies at $z\\sim1-2$, with stellar masses of\n(1-3)$\\times$10$^{10}$ M$_\\odot$. For the first time, we are able to\ncharacterize the population of galaxies that dominate the EBL at 1.2 mm.\n", "  In this paper we use ASPECS, the ALMA Spectroscopic Survey in the {\\em\nHubble} Ultra Deep Field (UDF) in band 3 and band 6, to place blind constraints\non the CO luminosity function and the evolution of the cosmic molecular gas\ndensity as a function of redshift up to $z\\sim 4.5$. This study is based on\ngalaxies that have been solely selected through their CO emission and not\nthrough any other property. In all of the redshift bins the ASPECS measurements\nreach the predicted `knee' of the CO luminosity function (around\n$5\\times10^{9}$ K km/s pc$^2$). We find clear evidence of an evolution in the\nCO luminosity function with respect to $z\\sim 0$, with more CO luminous\ngalaxies present at $z\\sim 2$. The observed galaxies at $z\\sim 2$ also appear\nmore gas-rich than predicted by recent semi-analytical models. The comoving\ncosmic molecular gas density within galaxies as a function of redshift shows a\nfactor 3-10 drop from $z \\sim 2$ to $z \\sim 0$ (with significant error bars),\nand possibly a decline at $z>3$. This trend is similar to the observed\nevolution of the cosmic star formation rate density. The latter therefore\nappears to be at least partly driven by the increased availability of molecular\ngas reservoirs at the peak of cosmic star formation ($z\\sim2$).\n", "  We study the molecular gas properties of high-$z$ galaxies observed in the\nALMA Spectroscopic Survey (ASPECS) that targets a $\\sim1$ arcmin$^2$ region in\nthe Hubble Ultra Deep Field (UDF), a blind survey of CO emission (tracing\nmolecular gas) in the 3mm and 1mm bands. Of a total of 1302 galaxies in the\nfield, 56 have spectroscopic redshifts and correspondingly well-defined\nphysical properties. Among these, 11 have infrared luminosities\n$L_{\\rm{}IR}>10^{11}$ L$_\\odot$, i.e. a detection in CO emission was expected.\nOut these, 7 are detected at various significance in CO, and 4 are undetected\nin CO emission. In the CO-detected sources, we find CO excitation conditions\nthat are lower than typically found in starburst/SMG/QSO environments. We use\nthe CO luminosities (including limits for non-detections) to derive molecular\ngas masses. We discuss our findings in context of previous molecular gas\nobservations at high redshift (star-formation law, gas depletion times, gas\nfractions): The CO-detected galaxies in the UDF tend to reside on the\nlow-$L_{\\rm{}IR}$ envelope of the scatter in the $L_{\\rm{}IR}-L'_{\\rm{}CO}$\nrelation, but exceptions exist. For the CO-detected sources, we find an average\ndepletion time of $\\sim$ 1 Gyr, with significant scatter. The average\nmolecular-to-stellar mass ratio ($M_{\\rm{}H2}$/$M_*$) is consistent with\nearlier measurements of main sequence galaxies at these redshifts, and again\nshows large variations among sources. In some cases, we also measure dust\ncontinuum emission. On average, the dust-based estimates of the molecular gas\nare a factor $\\sim$2-5$\\times$ smaller than those based on CO. Accounting for\ndetections as well as non-detections, we find large diversity in the molecular\ngas properties of the high-redshift galaxies covered by ASPECS.\n", "  We present a search for [CII] line and dust continuum emission from optical\ndropout galaxies at $z>6$ using ASPECS, our ALMA Spectroscopic Survey in the\nHubble Ultra-Deep Field (UDF). Our observations, which cover the frequency\nrange $212-272$ GHz, encompass approximately the range $6<z<8$ for [CII] line\nemission and reach a limiting luminosity of L$_{\\rm\n[CII]}\\sim$(1.6-2.5)$\\times$10$^{8}$ L$_{\\odot}$. We identify fourteen [CII]\nline emitting candidates in this redshift range with significances $>$4.5\n$\\sigma$, two of which correspond to blind detections with no optical\ncounterparts. At this significance level, our statistical analysis shows that\nabout 60\\% of our candidates are expected to be spurious. For one of our\nblindly selected [CII] line candidates, we tentatively detect the CO(6-5) line\nin our parallel 3-mm line scan. None of the line candidates are individually\ndetected in the 1.2 mm continuum. A stack of all [CII] candidates results in a\ntentative detection with $S_{1.2mm}=14\\pm5\\mu$Jy. This implies a dust-obscured\nstar formation rate (SFR) of $(3\\pm1)$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. We find that the\ntwo highest--SFR objects have candidate [CII] lines with luminosities that are\nconsistent with the low-redshift $L_{\\rm [CII]}$ vs. SFR relation. The other\ncandidates have significantly higher [CII] luminosities than expected from\ntheir UV--based SFR. At the current sensitivity it is unclear whether the\nmajority of these sources are intrinsically bright [CII] emitters, or spurious\nsources. If only one of our line candidates was real (a scenario greatly\nfavored by our statistical analysis), we find a source density for [CII]\nemitters at $6<z<8$ that is significantly higher than predicted by current\nmodels and some extrapolations from galaxies in the local universe.\n", "  We present direct estimates of the mean sky brightness temperature in\nobserving bands around 99GHz and 242GHz due to line emission from distant\ngalaxies. These values are calculated from the summed line emission observed in\na blind, deep survey for specrtal line emission from high redshift galaxies\nusing ALMA (the 'ASPECS' survey). In the 99 GHz band, the mean brightness will\nbe dominated by rotational transitions of CO from intermediate and high\nredshift galaxies. In the 242GHz band, the emission could be a combination of\nhigher order CO lines, and possibly [CII] 158$\\mu$m line emission from very\nhigh redshift galaxies ($z \\sim 6$ to 7). The mean line surface brightness is a\nquantity that is relevant to measurements of spectral distortions of the cosmic\nmicrowave background, and as a potential tool for studying large-scale\nstructures in the early Universe using intensity mapping. While the cosmic\nvolume and the number of detections are admittedly small, this pilot survey\nprovides a direct measure of the mean line surface brightness, independent of\nconversion factors, excitation, or other galaxy formation model assumptions.\nThe mean surface brightness in the 99GHZ band is: $T_B = 0.94\\pm 0.09$ $\\mu$K.\nIn the 242GHz band, the mean brightness is: $T_B = 0.55\\pm 0.033$ $\\mu$K. These\nshould be interpreted as lower limits on the average sky signal, since we only\ninclude lines detected individually in the blind survey, while in a low\nresolution intensity mapping experiment, there will also be the summed\ncontribution from lower luminosity galaxies that cannot be detected\nindividually in the current blind survey.\n", "  We report the discovery and orbit of a new dwarf planet candidate, 2015\nRR$_{245}$, by the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS). 2015 RR$_{245}$'s\norbit is eccentric ($e=0.586$), with a semi-major axis near 82 au, yielding a\nperihelion distance of 34 au. 2015 RR$_{245}$ has $g-r = 0.59 \\pm 0.11$ and\nabsolute magnitude $H_{r} = 3.6 \\pm 0.1$; for an assumed albedo of $p_V = 12$%\nthe object has a diameter of $\\sim670$ km. Based on astrometric measurements\nfrom OSSOS and Pan-STARRS1, we find that 2015 RR$_{245}$ is securely trapped on\nten-Myr timescales in the 9:2 mean-motion resonance with Neptune. It is the\nfirst TNO identified in this resonance. On hundred-Myr timescales, particles in\n2015 RR$_{245}$-like orbits depart and sometimes return to the resonance,\nindicating that 2015 RR$_{245}$ likely forms part of the long-lived metastable\npopulation of distant TNOs that drift between resonance sticking and actively\nscattering via gravitational encounters with Neptune. The discovery of a 9:2\nTNO stresses the role of resonances in the long-term evolution of objects in\nthe scattering disk, and reinforces the view that distant resonances are\nheavily populated in the current Solar System. This object further motivates\ndetailed modelling of the transient sticking population.\n", "  Spectator field models such as the curvaton scenario and the modulated\nreheating are attractive scenarios for the generation of the cosmic curvature\nperturbation, as the constraints on inflation models are relaxed. In this\npaper, we discuss the effect of Hubble induced masses on the dynamics of\nspectator fields after inflation. We pay particular attention to the Hubble\ninduced mass by the kinetic energy of an oscillating inflaton, which is\ngenerically unsuppressed but often overlooked. In the curvaton scenario, the\nHubble induced mass relaxes the constraint on the property of the inflaton and\nthe curvaton, such as the reheating temperature and the inflation scale. We\ncomment on the implication of our discussion for baryogenesis in the curvaton\nscenario. In the modulated reheating, the predictions of models e.g. the\nnon-gaussianity can be considerably altered. Furthermore, we propose a new\nmodel of the modulated reheating utilizing the Hubble induced mass which\nrealizes a wide range of the local non-gaussianity parameter.\n", "  The study of binary stars is critical to apprehend many of the most\ninteresting classes of stars. Moreover, quite often, the study of stars in\nbinary systems is our only mean to constrain stellar properties, such as masses\nand radii. Unfortunately, a great fraction of the most interesting binaries are\nso compact that they can only be apprehended by high-resolution techniques,\nmostly by interferometry. I present some results highlighting the use of\ninterferometry in the study of binary stars, from finding companions and\nderiving orbits, determining the mass and radius of stars, to studying mass\ntransfer in symbiotic stars, and tackling luminous blue variables. In\nparticular, I show how interferometric studies using the PIONIER instrument\nhave allowed us to confirm a dichotomy within symbiotic stars, obtain masses of\nstars with a precision better than 1%, and help us find a new Eta Carinae-like\nsystem. I will also illustrate the benefits for the study of binary stars one\nwould get from upgrading the VLT Interferometer so as to be able to observe in\nthe visible range.\n", "  Transmission spectroscopy facilitates the detection of molecules and/or\nclouds in the atmospheres of exoplanets. Such studies rely heavily on\nspace-based or large ground-based observatories, as one needs to perform time-\nresolved, high signal-to-noise spectroscopy. The FORS2 instrument at ESO's Very\nLarge Telescope is the obvious choice for performing such studies, and was\nindeed pioneering the field in 2010. After that, however, it was shown to\nsuffer from systematic errors caused by the Longitudinal Atmospheric Dispersion\nCorrector (LADC). This was successfully addressed, leading to a renewed\ninterest for this instrument as shown by the number of proposals submitted to\nperform transmission spectroscopy of exoplanets. We present here the context,\nthe problem and how we solved it, as well as the recent results obtained. We\nfinish by providing tips for an optimum strategy to do transmission\nspectroscopy with FORS2, in the hope that FORS2 may become the instrument of\nchoice for ground-based transmission spectroscopy of exoplanets.\n", "  We report here the non-detection of gravitational waves from the merger of\nbinary neutron star systems and neutron-star--black-hole systems during the\nfirst observing run of Advanced LIGO. In particular we searched for\ngravitational wave signals from binary neutron star systems with component\nmasses $\\in [1,3] M_{\\odot}$ and component dimensionless spins $< 0.05$. We\nalso searched for neutron-star--black-hole systems with the same neutron star\nparameters, black hole mass $\\in [2,99] M_{\\odot}$ and no restriction on the\nblack hole spin magnitude. We assess the sensitivity of the two LIGO detectors\nto these systems, and find that they could have detected the merger of binary\nneutron star systems with component mass distributions of $1.35\\pm0.13\nM_{\\odot}$ at a volume-weighted average distance of $\\sim$ 70Mpc, and for\nneutron-star--black-hole systems with neutron star masses of $1.4M_\\odot$ and\nblack hole masses of at least $5M_\\odot$, a volume-weighted average distance of\nat least $\\sim$ 110Mpc. From this we constrain with 90% confidence the merger\nrate to be less than 12,600 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ for binary-neutron star systems\nand less than 3,600 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ for neutron-star--black-hole systems.\nWe find that if no detection of neutron-star binary mergers is made in the next\ntwo Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo observing runs we would place significant\nconstraints on the merger rates. Finally, assuming a rate of\n$10^{+20}_{-7}$Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ short gamma ray bursts beamed towards the\nEarth and assuming that all short gamma-ray bursts have binary-neutron-star\n(neutron-star--black-hole) progenitors we can use our 90% confidence rate upper\nlimits to constrain the beaming angle of the gamma-ray burst to be greater than\n${2.3^{+1.7}_{-1.1}}^{\\circ}$ (${4.3^{+3.1}_{-1.9}}^{\\circ}$).\n", "  We analyze plasma heating in weakly collisional kinetic Alfv\\'en wave (KAW)\nturbulence using high resolution gyrokinetic simulations spanning the range of\nscales between the ion and the electron gyroradii. Real space structures that\nhave a higher than average heating rate are shown not to be confined to current\nsheets. This novel result is at odds with previous studies, which use the\nelectromagnetic work in the local electron fluid frame, i.e. $\\mathbf{J}\n\\!\\cdot\\! (\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v}_e\\times\\mathbf{B})$, as a proxy for\nturbulent dissipation to argue that heating follows the intermittent spatial\nstructure of the electric current. Furthermore, we show that electrons are\ndominated by parallel heating while the ions prefer the perpendicular heating\nroute. We comment on the implications of the results presented here.\n", "  An unidentified infrared emission (UIE) feature at 6.0 $\\mu$m is detected in\na number of astronomical sources showing the UIE bands. In contrast to the\nprevious suggestion that this band is due to C=O vibrational modes, we suggest\nthat the 6.0 $\\mu$m feature arises from olefinic double-bond functional groups.\nThese groups are likely to be attached to aromatic rings which are responsible\nfor the major UIE bands. The possibility that the formation of these functional\ngroups is related to the hydrogenation process is discussed.\n", "  We present $\\simeq$0$.\\!\\!^{\\prime\\prime}4$-resolution extinction-independent\ndistributions of star formation and dust in 11 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at\n$z = 1.3-3.0$. These galaxies are selected from sensitive, blank-field surveys\nof the $2' \\times 2'$ Hubble Ultra-Deep Field at $\\lambda = 5$ cm and 1.3 mm\nusing the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). They have star-formation rates (SFRs),\nstellar masses, and dust properties representative of massive main-sequence\nSFGs at $z \\sim 2$. Morphological classification performed on\nspatially-resolved stellar mass maps indicates a mixture of disk and\nmorphologically disturbed systems; half of the sample harbor X-ray active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN), thereby representing a diversity of $z \\sim 2$ SFGs\nundergoing vigorous mass assembly. We find that their intense star formation\nmost frequently occurs at the location of stellar-mass concentration and\nextends over an area comparable to their stellar-mass distribution, with a\nmedian diameter of $4.2 \\pm 1.8$ kpc. This provides direct evidence for\ngalaxy-wide star formation in distant, blank-field-selected main-sequence SFGs.\nThe typical galactic-average SFR surface density is 2.5\nM$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$, sufficiently high to drive outflows. In\nX-ray-selected AGN where radio emission is enhanced over the level associated\nwith star formation, the radio excess pinpoints the AGN, which are found to be\nco-spatial with star formation. The median extinction-independent size of\nmain-sequence SFGs is two times larger than those of bright submillimeter\ngalaxies whose SFRs are $3-8$ times larger, providing a constraint on the\ncharacteristic SFR ($\\sim300$ M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) above which a significant\npopulation of more compact star-forming galaxies appears to emerge.\n", "  Very fast (f/1.2 and f/1.35) transmissive spectrograph designs are presented\nfor Hector and MSE. The designs have 61mm x 61mm detectors, 4 or 5 camera\nlenses of aperture less than 228mm, with just 6 air/glass surfaces, and rely on\nextreme aspheres for their imaging performance. The throughput is excellent,\nbecause of the i-line glasses used, the small number of air/glass surfaces.\n", "  I show that the Reduced Speed of Light (RSL) approximation, when used\nproperly (i.e. as originally designed - only for the local sources but not for\nthe cosmic background), remains a highly accurate numerical method for modeling\ncosmic reionization. Simulated ionization and star formation histories from the\n\"Cosmic Reionization On Computers\" (CROC) project are insensitive to the\nadopted value of the reduced speed of light for as long as that value does not\nfall below about 10% of the true speed of light. A recent claim of the failure\nof the RSL approximation in the Illustris reionization model appears to be due\nto the effective speed of light being reduced in the equation for the cosmic\nbackground too, and, hence, illustrates the importance of maintaining the\ncorrect speed of light in modeling the cosmic background.\n", "  We report a measurement of the ratio ${\\cal R}(D^*) = {\\cal B}(\\bar{B}^0\n\\rightarrow D^{*+} \\tau^- \\bar{\\nu}_{\\tau})/{\\cal B}(\\bar{B}^0 \\rightarrow\nD^{*+} \\ell^- \\bar{\\nu}_{\\ell})$, where $\\ell$ denotes an electron or a muon.\nThe results are based on a data sample containing $772\\times10^6$ $B\\bar{B}$\npairs recorded at the $\\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance with the Belle detector at the\nKEKB $e^+ e^-$ collider. We select a sample of $B^0 \\bar{B}^0$ pairs by\nreconstructing both $B$ mesons in semileptonic decays to $D^{*\\mp} \\ell^{\\pm}$.\nWe measure ${\\cal R}(D^*)= 0.302 \\pm 0.030({\\rm stat)} \\pm 0.011({\\rm syst)}$,\nwhich is within $1.6 \\sigma$ of the Standard Model theoretical expectation,\nwhere the standard deviation $\\sigma$ includes systematic uncertainties. We use\nthis measurement to constrain several scenarios of new physics in a\nmodel-independent approach.\n", "  The global structure of solar corona observed in optical window is governed\nby the global magnetic field with different characteristics over solar activity\ncycle. Ludendorff flattening index becomes a popular measure of the global\nstructure of solar corona as observed during eclipse. In this study, 15 digital\nimages of solar corona from 1991 to 2016 were analyzed in order to construct\nthe coronal flattening profiles as a function of radius. In most of the cases,\nthe profile can be modeled with 2nd order polynomial function so that the\nradius with maximum flattening index ($R_{\\text{max}}$) can be determined.\nAlong with this value, Ludendorff index ($a+b$) was also calculated. Both\nLudendorff index and $R_{\\text{max}}$ show anti-correlation with monthly\nsunspot number, though the $R_{\\text{max}}$ values are more scattered. The\nvariation of $R_{\\text{max}}$ can be regarded as the impact of changing coronal\nbrightness profile over equator.\n", "  We report on magneto-transport properties of the Kondo semiconducting\ncompound CeRu$_2$Al$_{10}$, focusing on its exotic phase below $T_0$ = 27 K. In\nthis phase, an excess thermal conductivity $\\kappa$ emerges and is gradually\nsuppressed by magnetic field, strikingly resembling those observed in the\nhidden-order phase of URu$_2$Si$_2$. Our analysis indicates that low-energy\nmagnetic excitation is the most likely origin, as was also proposed for\nURu$_2$Si$_2$ recently, despite the largely reduced magnetic moments. Likewise,\nother transport properties such as resistivity, thermopower and Nernst effect\nexhibit distinct features characterizing the very different charge dynamics\nabove and below $T_0$, sharing similarities to URu$_2$Si$_2$, too. Given the\nexotic nature of the ordered phases in both compounds, whether a unified\ninterpretation to all these observations exists appears to be extremely\ninteresting.\n", "  X-ray observations of protostellar jets show evidence of strong shocks\nheating the plasma up to temperatures of a few million degrees. In some cases,\nthe shocked features appear to be stationary. They are interpreted as shock\ndiamonds. We aim at investigating the physics that guides the formation of\nX-ray emitting stationary shocks in protostellar jets, the role of the magnetic\nfield in determining the location, stability, and detectability in X-rays of\nthese shocks, and the physical properties of the shocked plasma. We performed a\nset of 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations modelling\nsupersonic jets ramming into a magnetized medium and explored different\nconfigurations of the magnetic field. The model takes into account the most\nrelevant physical effects, namely thermal conduction and radiative losses. We\ncompared the model results with observations, via the emission measure and the\nX-ray luminosity synthesized from the simulations. Our model explains the\nformation of X-ray emitting stationary shocks in a natural way. The magnetic\nfield collimates the plasma at the base of the jet and forms there a magnetic\nnozzle. After an initial transient, the nozzle leads to the formation of a\nshock diamond at its exit which is stationary over the time covered by the\nsimulations (~ 40 - 60 yr; comparable with time scales of the observations).\nThe shock generates a point-like X-ray source located close to the base of the\njet with luminosity comparable with that inferred from X-ray observations of\nprotostellar jets. For the range of parameters explored, the evolution of the\npost-shock plasma is dominated by the radiative cooling, whereas the thermal\nconduction slightly affects the structure of the shock.\n", "  We investigate the interplay between moduli dynamics and inflation, focusing\non the KKLT-scenario and cosmological $\\alpha$-attractors. General couplings\nbetween these sectors can induce a significant backreaction and potentially\ndestroy the inflationary regime; however, we demonstrate that this generically\ndoes not happen for $\\alpha$-attractors. Depending on the details of the\nsuperpotential, the volume modulus can either be stable during the entire\ninflationary trajectory, or become tachyonic at some point and act as a\nwaterfall field, resulting in a sudden end of inflation. In the latter case\nthere is a universal supersymmetric minimum where the scalars end up,\npreventing the decompactification scenario. The gravitino mass is independent\nfrom the inflationary scale with no fine-tuning of the parameters. The\nobservational predictions conform to the universal value of attractors, fully\ncompatible with the Planck data, with possibly a capped number of e-folds due\nto the interplay with moduli.\n", "  The Kepler Mission has discovered thousands of exoplanets and revolutionized\nour understanding of their population. This large, homogeneous catalog of\ndiscoveries has enabled rigorous studies of the occurrence rate of exoplanets\nand planetary systems as a function of their physical properties. However,\ntransit surveys like Kepler are most sensitive to planets with orbital periods\nmuch shorter than the orbital periods of Jupiter and Saturn, the most massive\nplanets in our Solar System. To address this deficiency, we perform a fully\nautomated search for long-period exoplanets with only one or two transits in\nthe archival Kepler light curves. When applied to the $\\sim 40,000$ brightest\nSun-like target stars, this search produces 16 long-period exoplanet\ncandidates. Of these candidates, 6 are novel discoveries and 5 are in systems\nwith inner short-period transiting planets. Since our method involves no human\nintervention, we empirically characterize the detection efficiency of our\nsearch. Based on these results, we measure the average occurrence rate of\nexoplanets smaller than Jupiter with orbital periods in the range 2-25 years to\nbe $2.0\\pm0.7$ planets per Sun-like star.\n", "  Most large-scale planetary magnetic fields are thought to be driven by low\nRossby number convection of a low magnetic Prandtl number fluid. Here kinematic\ndynamo action is investigated with an asymptotic, rapidly rotating dynamo model\nfor the plane layer geometry that is intrinsically low magnetic Prandtl number.\nThe thermal Prandtl number and Rayleigh number are varied to illustrate\nfundamental changes in flow regime, ranging from laminar cellular convection to\ngeostrophic turbulence in which an inverse energy cascade is present. A\ndecrease in the efficiency of the convection to generate a dynamo, as\ndetermined by an increase in the critical magnetic Reynolds number, is observed\nas the buoyancy forcing is increased. This decreased efficiency may result from\nboth the loss of correlations associated with the increasingly disordered\nstates of flow that are generated, and boundary layer behavior that enhances\nmagnetic diffusion locally. We find that the spatial characteristics of\n$\\alpha$, and thus the large-scale magnetic field, is dependent only weakly on\nchanges in flow behavior. However, our results are limited to the linear,\nkinematic dynamo regime, and future simulations including the Lorentz force are\ntherefore necessary to assess the robustness of this result. In contrast to the\nlarge-scale magnetic field, the behavior of the small-scale magnetic field is\ndirectly dependent on, and therefore shows significant variations with, the\nsmall-scale convective flow field.\n", "  The Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer uses a near-infrared camera to\nmeasure the optical path length variations between the two AO-corrected\napertures and provide high-angular resolution observations for all its science\nchannels (1.5-13 $\\mu$m). There is however a wavelength dependent component to\nthe atmospheric turbulence, which can introduce optical path length errors when\nobserving at a wavelength different from that of the fringe sensing camera.\nWater vapor in particular is highly dispersive and its effect must be taken\ninto account for high-precision infrared interferometric observations as\ndescribed previously for VLTI/MIDI or the Keck Interferometer Nuller. In this\npaper, we describe the new sensing approach that has been developed at the LBT\nto measure and monitor the optical path length fluctuations due to dry air and\nwater vapor separately. After reviewing the current performance of the system\nfor dry air seeing compensation, we present simultaneous H-, K-, and N-band\nobservations that illustrate the feasibility of our feedforward approach to\nstabilize the path length fluctuations seen by the LBTI nuller.\n", "  We have conducted the Meterwavelength Single-pulse Polarimetric Emission\nSurvey to study the radio emission properties of normal pulsars. A total of 123\npulsars with periods between 0.1 seconds and 8.5 seconds were observed in the\nsurvey at two different frequencies, 105 profiles at 333 MHz, 118 profiles at\n618 MHz and 100 pulsars at both. In this work we concentrate primarily on the\ntime-averaged properties of the pulsar emission. The measured widths of the\npulsar profiles in our sample usually exhibit the radius to frequency mapping.\nWe validate the existence of lower bounds for the distribution of profile\nwidths with pulsar period ($P$), which is seen for multiple definitions of the\nwidth, viz. a lower boundary line (LBL) at $2.7^{\\circ} P^{-0.5}$ with width\nmeasured at 50% level of profile peak, a LBL at $5.7^{\\circ} P^{-0.5}$ for 10%\nlevel of peak and LBL at $6.3^{\\circ} P^{-0.5}$ for width defined as 5$\\sigma$\nabove the baseline level. In addition we have measured the degree of linear\npolarization in the average profile of pulsars and confirmed their dependence\non pulsar spindown energy loss ($\\dot{E}$). The single pulse polarization data\nshow interesting trends with the polarization position angle (PPA) distribution\nexhibiting the simple rotating vector model for high $\\dot{E}$ pulsars while\nthe PPA becomes more complex for medium and low $\\dot{E}$ pulsars. The single\npulse total intensity data is useful for studying a number of emission\nproperties from pulsars like subpulse drifting, nulling and mode changing which\nis being explored in separate works.\n", "  A large sample of pulsars was observed as part of the Meterwavelength\nSingle-pulse Polarimetric Emission Survey. We carried out a detailed\nfluctuation spectral analysis which revealed periodic features in 46% pulsars\nincluding 22 pulsars where drifting characteristics were reported for the first\ntime. The pulsar population can be categorized into three distinct groups,\npulsars which show systematic drift motion within the pulse window, the pulsars\nshowing no systematic drift but periodic amplitude fluctuation and pulsars with\nno periodic variations. We discovered the dependence of the drifting phenomenon\non the spin down energy loss ($\\dot{E}$), with the three categories occupying\ndistinctly different regions along the $\\dot{E}$ axis. The estimation of the\ndrift periodicity ($P_3$) from the peak frequency in the fluctuation spectra is\nambiguous due to the aliasing effect. However, using basic physical arguments\nwe were able to determine $P_3$ in pulsars showing systematic drift motion. The\nestimated $P_3$ values in these pulsars were anti-correlated with $\\dot{E}$\nwhich favoured the Partially Screened Gap model of Inner Acceleration Region in\npulsars.\n", "  We determine the topological phase diagram of\nBiTl(S$_{1-\\delta}$Se$_{\\delta}$)$_2$ as a function of doping and temperature\nfrom first-principles calculations. Due to electron\\textendash phonon\ninteraction, the bands are renormalized at finite temperature, allowing for a\ntransition between the trivial ($Z_2=0$) and non-trivial ($Z_2=1$) topological\nphase. We find two distinct regions of the phase diagram with non-trivial\ntopology. In BiTlS$_2$, the phonons promote the crystal to the topological\nphase at high temperature, while in BiTlSe$_2$, the topological phase exists\nonly at low temperature. This behaviour is explained by the symmetry of the\nphonon coupling potential, whereby the even phonon modes (whose potential is\neven under inversion) promote the topological phase and the odd phonon modes\npromote the trivial phase.\n", "  The Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) is a new optical/near-infrared multi-fiber\nspectrograph design for the prime focus of the 8.2m Subaru telescope. PFS will\ncover 1.3 degree diameter field with 2394 fibers to complement the imaging\ncapability of Hyper SuprimeCam (HSC). The prime focus unit of PFS called Prime\nFocus Instrument (PFI) provides the interface with the top structure of Subaru\ntelescope and also accommodates the optical bench in which Cobra fiber\npositioners are located. In addition, the acquisition and guiding cameras\n(AGCs), the optical fiber positioner system, the cable wrapper, the fiducial\nfibers, illuminator, and viewer, the field element, and the telemetry system\nare located inside the PFI. The mechanical structure of the PFI was designed\nwith special care such that its deflections sufficiently match those of the\nHSC's Wide Field Corrector (WFC) so the fibers will stay on targets over the\ncourse of the observations within the required accuracy. In this report, the\nlatest status of PFI development will be given including the performance of PFI\ncomponents, the setup and performance of the integration and testing equipment.\n", "  We present a novel, self-consistent and robust theoretical model to\ninvestigate elastic interactions between topological defects in liquid crystal\nshells. Accounting for the non-concentric nature of the shell in a simple\nmanner, we are able to successfully and accurately explain and predict the\npositions of the defects, most relevant in the context of colloidal\nself-assembly. We calibrate and test our model on existing experimental data,\nand extend it to all newly observed defects configurations in chiral nematic\nshells. We perform new experiments to check further and confirm the validity of\nthe present model. Moreover, we are able to obtain quantitative estimates of\nthe energies of $+1$ or $+3/2$ disclination lines in cholesterics, whose\nintricate nature was only reported recently.\n", "  We review a recent letter published in Phys. Rev. Lett. $\\textbf{116}$,\n161804 (2016) of which the main argument is that the mode dependent magnetic\nform factors at axion haloscopes depend on the position of the cavity inside\nthe solenoid while the corresponding electric form factors do not. We, however,\nfind no such dependence, which is also equivalent to the statement that the\nelectric and corresponding magnetic energy stored in the cavity modes are the\nsame regardless of the position of the cavity inside the solenoid. Furthermore,\nwe extend the statement to the cases satisfying $\\vec{\\nabla}\\times\\vec{B}_{\\rm\nexternal}=0$, where $\\vec{B}_{\\rm external}$ is a static magnetic field\nprovided by a magnet at an axion haloscope. Two typical magnets, solenoidal and\ntoroidal, satisfy $\\vec{\\nabla}\\times\\vec{B}_{\\rm external}=0$, thus the\nelectric and corresponding magnetic energy stored in the cavity modes are\nalways the same in both cases. The energy, however, is independent of the\nposition of the cavity in axion haloscopes with a solenoid, but depends on\nthose with a toroidal magnet.\n", "  We briefly discuss a method to construct a global, analytic, approximate\nspacetime for precessing, spinning binary black holes. The spacetime\nconstruction is broken into three parts: the inner zones are the spacetimes\nclose to each black hole, and are approximated by perturbed Kerr solutions; the\nnear zone is far from the two black holes, and described by the post-Newtonian\nmetric; and finally the wave (far) zone, where retardation effects need to be\ntaken into account, is well modeled by the post-Minkowskian metric. These\nindividual spacetimes are then stitched together using asymptotic matching\ntechniques to obtain a global solution that approximately satisfies the\nEinstein field equations. Precession effects are introduced by rotating the\nblack hole spin direction according to the precessing equations of motion, in a\nway that is consistent with the global spacetime construction.\n", "  PFS (Prime Focus Spectrograph), a next generation facility instrument on the\n8.2-meter Subaru Telescope, is a very wide-field, massively multiplexed,\noptical and near-infrared spectrograph. Exploiting the Subaru prime focus, 2394\nreconfigurable fibers will be distributed over the 1.3 deg field of view. The\nspectrograph has been designed with 3 arms of blue, red, and near-infrared\ncameras to simultaneously observe spectra from 380nm to 1260nm in one exposure\nat a resolution of ~1.6-2.7A. An international collaboration is developing this\ninstrument under the initiative of Kavli IPMU. The project is now going into\nthe construction phase aiming at undertaking system integration in 2017-2018\nand subsequently carrying out engineering operations in 2018-2019. This article\ngives an overview of the instrument, current project status and future paths\nforward.\n", "  We describe the design and performance of the SuMIRe Prime Focus Spectrograph\n(PFS) visible camera cryostats. SuMIRe PFS is a massively multi-plexed\nground-based spectrograph consisting of four identical spectrograph modules,\neach receiving roughly 600 fibers from a 2394 fiber robotic positioner at the\nprime focus. Each spectrograph module has three channels covering wavelength\nranges 380~nm -- 640~nm, 640~nm -- 955~nm, and 955~nm -- 1.26~um, with the\ndispersed light being imaged in each channel by a f/1.07 vacuum Schmidt camera.\nThe cameras are very large, having a clear aperture of 300~mm at the entrance\nwindow, and a mass of $\\sim$280~kg. In this paper we describe the design of the\nvisible camera cryostats and discuss various aspects of cryostat performance.\n", "  The Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) of the Subaru Measurement of Images and\nRedshifts (SuMIRe) project for Subaru telescope consists in four identical\nspectrographs fed by 600 fibers each. Each spectrograph is composed by an\noptical entrance unit that creates a collimated beam and distributes the light\nto three channels, two visibles and one near infrared. This paper presents the\non-going effort for the tests & integration process for the first spectrograph\nchannel: we have developed a detailed Assembly Integration and Test (AIT) plan,\nas well as the methods, detailed processes and I&T tools. We describe the tools\nwe designed to assemble the parts and to test the performance of the\nspectrograph. We also report on the thermal acceptance tests we performed on\nthe first visible camera unit. We also report on and discuss the technical\ndifficulties that did appear during this integration phase. Finally, we detail\nthe important logistic process that is require to transport the components from\nother country to Marseille.\n", "  We address the origin of Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs), which have stellar\nmasses typical of dwarf galaxies but effective radii of Milky Way-sized\nobjects. Their formation mechanism, and whether they are failed $\\rm L_{\\star}$\ngalaxies or diffuse dwarfs, are challenging issues. Using zoom-in cosmological\nsimulations from the NIHAO project, we show that UDG analogues form naturally\nin medium-mass haloes due to episodes of gas outflows associated with star\nformation. The simulated UDGs live in isolated haloes of masses $10^{10-11}\\rm\nM_{\\odot}$, have stellar masses of $10^{7-8.5}\\rm M_{\\odot}$, effective radii\nlarger than 1 kpc and dark matter cores. They show a broad range of colors, an\naverage S\\'ersic index of 0.83, a typical distribution of halo spin and\nconcentration, and a non-negligible HI gas mass of $10^{7-9}\\rm M_{\\odot}$,\nwhich correlates with the extent of the galaxy. Gas availability is crucial to\nthe internal processes that form UDGs: feedback driven gas outflows, and\nsubsequent dark matter and stellar expansion, are the key to reproduce faint,\nyet unusually extended, galaxies. This scenario implies that UDGs represent a\ndwarf population of low surface brightness galaxies and should exist in the\nfield. The largest isolated UDGs should contain more HI gas than less extended\ndwarfs of similar $\\rm M_{\\star}$.\n", "  Bailey et al.~(2016) and Gomes et al.~(2016) recently suggested that the 6\ndegree misalignment between the Sun's rotational equator and the orbital plane\nof the major planets may be produced by the forcing from the hypothetical\nPlanet Nine on an inclined orbit. Here we present a simple but accurate\ncalculation of the effect, which provides a clear description of how the Sun's\nspin orientation depends on the property of Planet Nine in this scenario.\n", "  We studied nearly optimally Ni-substituted BaFe$_{2-x}$Ni$_x$As$_2$ (BFNA)\nsingle crystals with $T_C \\approx 18.5$\\,K. In irreversible magnetization\nmeasurements, we determined the field dependence of the critical-current\ndensity and discuss the nature of observed strong bulk pinning. Using intrinsic\nmultiple Andreev reflections effect (IMARE) spectroscopy, we directly determine\ntwo distinct superconducting gaps and resolve their moderate anisotropy in the\nmomentum space. The BCS-ratio for the large gap $2\\Delta_L/k_BT_C > 4.1$\nevidences for a strong coupling in the $\\Delta_L$-bands.\n", "  We present the current optical design for the IRIS Atmospheric Dispersion\nCorrector (ADC). The ADC is designed for residual dispersions less than ~1 mas\nacross a given passband at elevations of 25 degrees. Since the last report, the\narea of the IRIS Imager has increased by a factor of four, and the pupil size\nhas increased from 75 to 90mm, both of which contribute to challenges with the\ndesign. Several considerations have led to the current design: residual\ndispersion, amount of introduced distortion, glass transmission, glass\navailability, and pupil displacement. In particular it was found that there are\nsignificant distortions that appear (two different components) that can lead to\nimage blur over long exposures. Also, pupil displacement increases the\nwavefront error at the imager focus. We discuss these considerations, discuss\nthe compromises, and present the final design choice and expected performance.\n", "  TMT has defined the accuracy to be achieved for both absolute and\ndifferential astrometry in its top-level requirements documents. Because of the\ncomplexities of different types of astrometric observations, these requirements\ncannot be used to specify system design parameters directly. The TMT astrometry\nworking group therefore developed detailed astrometry error budgets for a\nvariety of science cases. These error budgets detail how astrometric errors\npropagate through the calibration, observing and data reduction processes. The\nbudgets need to be condensed into sets of specific requirements that can be\nused by each subsystem team for design purposes. We show how this flowdown from\nerror budgets to design requirements is achieved for the case of TMT's\nfirst-light Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (IRIS) instrument.\n", "  IRIS is a near-infrared (0.84 to 2.4 microns) integral field spectrograph and\nwide-field imager being developed for first light with the Thirty Meter (TMT).\nIt mounts to the advanced optics (AO) system NFIRAOS and has integrated\non-instrument wavefront sensors (OIWFS) to achieve diffraction-limited spatial\nresolution at wavelengths longer than 1 micron. With moderate spectral\nresolution (R ~4,000 - 8,000) and large bandpass over a continuous field of\nview, IRIS will open new opportunities in virtually every area of astrophysical\nscience. It will be able to resolve surface features tens of kilometers across\nTitan, while also mapping the distant galaxies at the scale of an individual\nstar forming region. This paper summarizes the entire design and capabilities,\nand includes the results from the nearly completed preliminary design phase.\n", "  We describe the near real-time transient-source discovery engine for the\nintermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF), currently in operations at the\nInfrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC), Caltech. We coin this system\nthe IPAC/iPTF Discovery Engine (or IDE). We review the algorithms used for\nPSF-matching, image subtraction, detection, photometry, and machine-learned\n(ML) vetting of extracted transient candidates. We also review the performance\nof our ML classifier. For a limiting signal-to-noise ratio of 4 in relatively\nunconfused regions, \"bogus\" candidates from processing artifacts and imperfect\nimage subtractions outnumber real transients by ~ 10:1. This can be\nconsiderably higher for image data with inaccurate astrometric and/or\nPSF-matching solutions. Despite this occasionally high contamination rate, the\nML classifier is able to identify real transients with an efficiency (or\ncompleteness) of ~ 97% for a maximum tolerable false-positive rate of 1% when\nclassifying raw candidates. All subtraction-image metrics, source features, ML\nprobability-based real-bogus scores, contextual metadata from other surveys,\nand possible associations with known Solar System objects are stored in a\nrelational database for retrieval by the various science working groups. We\nreview our efforts in mitigating false-positives and our experience in\noptimizing the overall system in response to the multitude of science projects\nunderway with iPTF.\n", "  The Boolean algebra is the natural theoretical framework for a classical\ninformation treatment. The basic logical operations are usually performed using\nlogic gates. In this Letter we demonstrate that NOT, OR and AND gates can be\nrealized exploiting the near-field radiative interaction in N-body systems with\nphase change materials. With the recent development of a photon thermal\ntransistor and thermal memory, this result paves the way for a full information\ntreatment and smart solutions for active thermal management at nanoscale with\nphotons.\n", "  A new optical state is described both analytically and numerically at the\nboundary of a chiral medium with continuous helical symmetry of the dielectric\ntensor. The tangential wave number is assumed to be zero. The state appears to\nbe localized near the boundary. It does not transfer energy along this boundary\nand falls off exponentially with the distance from the boundary. The field\npenetration into chiral medium is blocked at wavelengths close to the helical\npitch and corresponding to the photonic band gap. The polarization of light\nnear the boundary has the same sign of chirality as the helical medium. It is\nshown that the homogeneous environment, or the substrate must exhibit the\nanisotropic metallic reflection. Spectral manifestation of the state is\ndetermined by the angle between the optical axes at the interface. A realistic\nexample is considered at the boundary of a cholesteric liquid crystal and a\nmetal-dielectric anisotropic nanocomposite.\n", "  Several problems in computer algebra can be efficiently solved by reducing\nthem to calculations over finite fields. In this paper, we describe an\nalgorithm for the reconstruction of multivariate polynomials and rational\nfunctions from their evaluation over finite fields. Calculations over finite\nfields can in turn be efficiently performed using machine-size integers in\nstatically-typed languages. We then discuss the application of the algorithm to\nseveral techniques related to the computation of scattering amplitudes, such as\nthe four- and six-dimensional spinor-helicity formalism, tree-level recursion\nrelations, and multi-loop integrand reduction via generalized unitarity. The\nmethod has good efficiency and scales well with the number of variables and the\ncomplexity of the problem. As an example combining these techniques, we present\nthe calculation of full analytic expressions for the two-loop five-point\non-shell integrands of the maximal cuts of the planar penta-box and the\nnon-planar double-pentagon topologies in Yang-Mills theory, for a complete set\nof independent helicity configurations.\n", "  Lepton mass effects play a decisive role in description of elastic\nlepton-proton scattering when the beam's energy is comparable to the mass of\nthe lepton. The future MUSE experiment, which is devised to solve the \"Proton\nRadius Puzzle\", is going to cover the corresponding kinematic region for a\nscattering of muons by a proton target. We anticipate that helicity-flip meson\nexchanges will make a difference in comparison of elastic electron-proton\nversus muon-proton scattering in MUSE. In this article, we estimate the\n$\\sigma$ meson exchange contribution in the $t$-channel. This contribution,\nmediated by two-photon coupling of $\\sigma$, is calculated to be at most $\\sim\n0.1 \\%$ for muons in the kinematics of MUSE and it is about 3 orders in\nmagnitude larger than for electrons because of the lepton-mass difference.\n", "  The scotogenic mechanism for radiative neutrino mass is generalized to\ninclude neutron-antineutron oscillation as well as proton decay. Dark matter is\nstabilized by extending the notion of lepton parity to matter parity.\nLeptogenesis is also a possible byproduct. This framework unifies the\ndescription of all these important, but seemingly unrelated, topics in physics\nbeyond the standard model of particle interactions.\n", "  The ratio of the Higgs couplings to $WW$ and $ZZ$ pairs, $\\lambda_{WZ}$, is a\nfundamental parameter in electroweak symmetry breaking as well as a measure of\nthe (approximate) custodial symmetry possessed by the gauge boson mass matrix.\nWe show that Higgs decays to four leptons are sensitive, via tree level/1-loop\ninterference effects, to both the magnitude and, in particular, overall sign of\n$\\lambda_{WZ}$. Determining this sign requires interference effects, as it is\nnearly impossible to measure with rate information. Furthermore, simply\ndetermining the sign effectively establishes the custodial representation of\nthe Higgs boson. We find that $h\\to4\\ell$ ($4\\ell \\equiv 2e2\\mu, 4e, 4\\mu$)\ndecays have excellent prospects of directly establishing the overall sign at a\nhigh luminosity 13 TeV LHC. We also examine the ultimate LHC sensitivity in\n$h\\to4\\ell$ to the magnitude of $\\lambda_{WZ}$. Our results are independent of\nother measurements of the Higgs boson couplings and, in particular, largely\nfree of assumptions about the top quark Yukawa couplings which also enter at\n1-loop. This makes $h\\to4\\ell$ a unique and independent probe of the\nelectroweak symmetry breaking mechanism and custodial symmetry.\n", "  We perform quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the itinerant-localized\nperiodic Kondo-Heisenberg model for the underdoped cuprates to calculate the\nassociated spin correlation functions. The strong electron correlations are\nshown to play a key role in the abrupt destruction of the quasi long-range\nantiferromagnetic order in the lightly doped regime.\n", "  MATISSE is the second-generation mid-infrared spectrograph and imager for the\nVery Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) at Paranal. This new interferometric\ninstrument will allow significant advances by opening new avenues in various\nfundamental research fields: studying the planet-forming region of disks around\nyoung stellar objects, understanding the surface structures and mass loss\nphenomena affecting evolved stars, and probing the environments of black holes\nin active galactic nuclei. As a first breakthrough, MATISSE will enlarge the\nspectral domain of current optical interferometers by offering the L and M\nbands in addition to the N band. This will open a wide wavelength domain,\nranging from 2.8 to 13 um, exploring angular scales as small as 3 mas (L band)\n/ 10 mas (N band). As a second breakthrough, MATISSE will allow mid-infrared\nimaging - closure-phase aperture-synthesis imaging - with up to four Unit\nTelescopes (UT) or Auxiliary Telescopes (AT) of the VLTI. Moreover, MATISSE\nwill offer a spectral resolution range from R ~ 30 to R ~ 5000. Here, we\npresent one of the main science objectives, the study of protoplanetary disks,\nthat has driven the instrument design and motivated several VLTI upgrades\n(GRA4MAT and NAOMI). We introduce the physical concept of MATISSE including a\ndescription of the signal on the detectors and an evaluation of the expected\nperformances. We also discuss the current status of the MATISSE instrument,\nwhich is entering its testing phase, and the foreseen schedule for the next two\nyears that will lead to the first light at Paranal.\n", "  MATISSE (Multi AperTure mid-Infrared SpectroScopic Experiment) is the next\ngeneration spectro-interferometer at the European Southern Observatory VLTI\noperating in the spectral bands L, M and N, and combining four beams from the\nunit and auxiliary telescopes. MATISSE is now fully integrated at the\nObservatoire de la C\\^ote d'Azur in Nice (France), and has entered very\nrecently its testing phase in laboratory. This paper summarizes the equations\ndescribing the MATISSE signal and the associated sources of noise. The\nspecifications and the expected performances of the instrument are then\nevaluated taking into account the current characteristics of the instrument and\nthe VLTI infrastructure, including transmission and contrast degradation\nbudgets. In addition, we present the different MATISSE simulation tools that\nwill be made available to the future users.\n", "  It is not yet well known whether narrow line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies follow\nthe $M_{BH} - \\sigma_{\\star}$ relation found for normal galaxies. Emission\nlines, such as [SII] or [OIII]$\\lambda$5007, have been used as a surrogate of\nthe stellar velocity dispersion and various results have been obtained. On the\nother hand, some active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have shown Balmer emission with\nan additional intermediate component (IC) besides the well-known narrow and\nbroad lines. In order to re-examine the location of NLS1 in the $M_{BH} -\n\\sigma_{\\star}$ relation, we test some emission lines, such as the narrow\ncomponent (NC) of H$\\alpha$ and the forbidden [NII]$\\lambda \\lambda$6548,6584\nand [SII]$\\lambda \\lambda$6716,6731 lines, as replacements for\n$\\sigma_{\\star}$. On the other hand, we study the properties of the IC of\nH$\\alpha$ found in 14 galaxies of the sample to find a link between this\ncomponent, the central engine, and the remaining lines. We also compare the\nemission among the broad component (BC) of H$\\alpha$ and those emitted at the\nnarrow line region (NLR). We have obtained and studied medium-resolution\nspectra (170 km s$^{-1}$ FWHM at H$\\alpha$) of 36 NLS1 galaxies in the optical\nrange $\\sim$5800 - 6800\\AA. We found that, in general, most of the galaxies lie\nbelow the $M_{BH} - \\sigma_{\\star}$ relation when the NC of H$\\alpha$, [SII],\nand [NII] lines are used as a surrogate of $\\sigma_{\\star}$. Besides this, we\nfound that 13 galaxies show an IC, most of which are in the velocity range\n$\\sim$ 700 $-$ 1500 km s$^{- 1}$. This is same range as in AGN types and is\nwell correlated with the FWHM of BC and, therefore, with the BH mass. On the\nother hand, we found that there is a correlation between the luminosity of the\nBC of H$\\alpha$ and NC, IC, [NII]$\\lambda$6584, and [SII] lines.\n", "  IRIS (InfraRed Imaging Spectrograph) is one of the first-generation\ninstruments for the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT). IRIS is composed of a\ncombination of near-infrared (0.84--2.4 $\\mu$m) diffraction limited imager and\nintegral field spectrograph. To achieve near-diffraction limited resolutions in\nthe near-infrared wavelength region, IRIS uses the advanced adaptive optics\nsystem NFIRAOS (Narrow Field Infrared Adaptive Optics System) and integrated\non-instrument wavefront sensors (OIWFS). However, IRIS itself has challenging\nspecifications. First, the overall system wavefront error should be less than\n40 nm in Y, z, J, and H-band and 42 nm in K-band over a 34.0 $\\times$ 34.0\narcsecond field of view. Second, the throughput of the imager components should\nbe more than 42 percent. To achieve the extremely low wavefront error and high\nthroughput, all reflective design has been newly proposed. We have adopted a\nnew design policy called \"Co-Axis double-TMA\", which cancels the asymmetric\naberrations generated by \"collimator/TMA\" and \"camera/TMA\" efficiently. The\nlatest imager design meets all specifications, and, in particular, the\nwavefront error is less than 17.3 nm and throughput is more than 50.8 percent.\nHowever, to meet the specification of wavefront error and throughput as built\nperformance, the IRIS imager requires both mirrors with low surface\nirregularity after high-reflection coating in cryogenic and high-level Assembly\nIntegration and Verification (AIV). To deal with these technical challenges, we\nhave done the tolerance analysis and found that total pass rate is almost 99\npercent in the case of gauss distribution and more than 90 percent in the case\nof parabolic distribution using four compensators. We also have made an AIV\nplan and feasibility check of the optical elements. In this paper, we will\npresent the details of this optical system.\n", "  Recent observations of neutral Galactic interstellar medium showed that\nfilamentary structures of HI clouds are aligned with the interstellar magnetic\nfield. Many interesting applications are proposed based on the alignment such\nas measurement of magnetic field strength through the Chandrasekhar-Fermi\nmethod and removal of polarized foreground dust emissions for the detection of\ninflationary polarized emission in the cosmic microwave background radiation.\nHowever, the physical origin of the alignment remains to be explained. To\nunderstand the alignment mechanism, we examine formation of HI clouds triggered\nby shock compression of diffuse warm neutral medium using three-dimensional\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations with the effects of optically thin cooling and\nheating. We show that the shock-compressed diffuse interstellar medium of\ndensity n~1 cm^-3 evolves into HI clouds with typical density n~50 cm^-3 via\nthermal instability driven by cooling, which is consistent with previous\nstudies. We apply a machine vision transformation developed by Clark et\nal.(2014) to the resulting column density structures obtained by the\nsimulations in order to measure angle correlation between filamentary\nstructures of HI clouds and magnetic field. We find that the orientation of HI\nfilaments depends on the environmental turbulent velocity field, particularly\non the strength of shear strain in the direction of the magnetic field, which\nis controlled by the angle between the shock propagation direction and upstream\nmagnetic field. When the strain along the magnetic field is weak, filamentary\ncomponents of HI clouds basically lie perpendicular to the magnetic field.\nHowever, the filaments have come to align with the magnetic field, if we\nenhance the turbulent strain along the magnetic field or if we set turbulence\nin the preshock medium.\n", "  We review the potential of Astrophotonics, a relatively young field at the\ninterface between photonics and astronomical instrumentation, for\nspectro-interferometry. We review some fundamental aspects of photonic science\nthat drove the emer- gence of astrophotonics, and highlight the achievements in\nobservational astrophysics. We analyze the prospects for further technological\ndevelopment also considering the potential synergies with other fields of\nphysics (e.g. non-linear optics in condensed matter physics). We also stress\nthe central role of fiber optics in routing and transporting light, delivering\ncomplex filters, or interfacing instruments and telescopes, more specifically\nin the context of a growing usage of adaptive optics.\n", "  Stellar clusters are open windows to understand stellar evolution.\nSpecifically, the change with time and the dependence on mass of different\nstellar properties. As such, they are our laboratories where different theories\ncan be tested. We try to understand the origin of the connection between\nlithium depletion in F, G and K stars, rotation and activity, in particular in\nthe Pleiades open cluster. We have collected all the relevant data in the\nliterature, including information regarding rotation period, binarity and\nactivity, and cross-matched with proper motions, multi-wavelength photometry\nand membership probability from the DANCe database. In order to avoid biases,\nonly Pleiades single members with probabilities larger than p=0.75 have been\nincluded in the discussion. Results. The analysis confirms that there is a\nstrong link between activity, rotation and the lithium equivalent width excess,\nspecially for the range Lum(bol) = 0.5-0.2 Lsun (about K2-K7 spectral types or\n0.75-0.95 Msun). It is not possible to disentangle these effects but we cannot\nexclude that the observed lithium overabundance is partially an observational\neffect due to enhanced activity, due to a large coverage by stellar spots\ninduced by high rotation rates. Since a bona fide lithium enhancement is\npresent in young, fast rotators, both activity and rotation should play a role\nin the lithium problem.\n", "  We present Auger-electron-detected magnetic resonance (AEDMR) experiments on\nphosphorus donors in silicon, where the selective optical generation of\ndonor-bound excitons is used for the electrical detection of the electron spin\nstate. Because of the long dephasing times of the electron spins in\nisotopically purified $^{28}$Si, weak microwave fields are sufficient, which\nallow to realize broadband AEDMR in a commercial ESR resonator. Implementing\nAuger-electron-detected ENDOR, we further demonstrate the optically-assisted\ncontrol of the nuclear spin under conditions where the hyperfine splitting is\nnot resolved in the optical spectrum. Compared to previous studies, this\nsignificantly relaxes the requirements on the sample and the experimental\nsetup, e.g. with respect to strain, isotopic purity and temperature. We show\nAEDMR of phosphorus donors in silicon with natural isotope composition, and\ndiscuss the feasibility of ENDOR measurements also in this system.\n", "  The ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) represents one of the most complete and\nsensitive soft X-ray all-sky surveys to date. However, the deficient positional\naccuracy of the RASS Bright Source Catalog (BSC) and subsequent lack of firm\noptical identifications affect the multi-wavelength studies of X-ray sources.\nThe widely used positional errors $\\sigma_{pos}$ based on the Tycho Stars\nCatalog (Tycho-1) have previously been applied for identifying objects in the\noptical band. The considerably sharper Chandra view covers a fraction of RASS\nsources, whose $\\sigma_{pos}$ could be improved by utilizing the sub-arcsec\npositional accuracy of Chandra observations. We cross-match X-ray objects\nbetween the BSC and \\emph{Chandra} sources extracted from the Advanced CCD\nImaging Spectrometer (ACIS) archival observations. A combined counterparts list\n(BSCxACIS) with \\emph{Chandra} spatial positions weighted by the X-ray flux of\nmulti-counterparts is employed to evaluate and improve the former\nidentifications of BSC with the other surveys. Based on these identification\nevaluations, we suggest that the point-likeness of BSC sources and INS\n(isolated neutron stars) candidates should be carefully reconsidered.\n", "  Superoscillating functions, i.e., functions that locally oscillate at a rate\nfaster than their highest Fourier component, are of interest for applications\nfrom fundamental physics to engineering. Here, we develop a new method which\nallows one to construct superoscillations of arbitrarily high frequency and\narbitrarily long duration in a computationally efficient way. We also present a\nmethod for constructing non-singular Schr\\\"odinger potentials whose ground\nstate is a superoscillating wave function.\n", "  The weakly bound exotic ${}^{11}$Be nucleus, famous for its ground-state\nparity inversion and distinct n+ ${}^{10}$Be halo structure, is investigated\nfrom first principles using chiral two- and three-nucleon forces. An explicit\ntreatment of continuum effects is found to be indispensable. We study the\nsensitivity of the ${}^{11}$Be spectrum to the details of the three-nucleon\nforce and demonstrate that only certain chiral interactions are capable of\nreproducing the parity inversion. With such interactions, the extremely large\nE1 transition between the bound states is reproduced. We compare our\nphotodisintegration calculations to conflicting experimental data and predict a\ndistinct dip around the $3/2^-_1$ resonance energy. Finally, we predict\nlow-lying $3/2^+$ and $9/2^+$ resonances that are not or not sufficiently\nmeasured in experiments.\n", "  We investigate the effect of epitaxial strain on the Mott metal-insulator\ntransition (MIT) in perovskite systems with d^1 and d^2 electron configuration\nof the transition metal (TM) cation. We first discuss the general trends\nexpected from the changes in the crystal-field splitting and in the hopping\nparameters that are induced by epitaxial strain. We argue that the\nstrain-induced crystal-field splitting generally favors the Mott-insulating\nstate, whereas the strain-induced changes in the hopping parameters favor the\nmetallic state under compressive strain and the insulating state under tensile\nstrain. Thus, the two effects can effectively cancel each other under\ncompressive strain, while they usually cooperate under tensile strain, in this\ncase favoring the insulating state. We then validate these general\nconsiderations by performing electronic structure calculations for several d^1\nand d^2 perovskites, using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and\ndynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). We isolate the individual effects of\nstrain-induced changes in either hopping or crystal-field by performing DMFT\ncalculations where we fix one type of parameter to the corresponding unstrained\nDFT values. These calculations confirm our general considerations for SrVO_3\n(d^1) and LaVO_3 (d^2), whereas the case of LaTiO_3 (d^1) is distinctly\ndifferent, due to the strong effect of the octahedral tilt distortion in the\nunderlying perovskite crystal structure. Our results demonstrate the\npossibility to tune the electronic properties of correlated TM oxides by using\nepitaxial strain, which allows to control the strength of electronic\ncorrelations and the vicinity to the Mott MIT.\n", "  Photoelectron spectra obtained from the ab initio solution of the\ntime-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation can be in striking disagreement with\npredictions by the strong-field approximation (SFA) not only at low energy but\nalso around twice the ponderomotive energy where the transition from the direct\nto the rescattered electrons is expected. In fact, the relative enhancement of\nthe ionization probability compared to the SFA in this regime can be several\norders of magnitude. We show for which laser and target parameters such an\nenhancement occurs and for which the SFA prediction is qualitatively good. The\nenhancement is analyzed in terms of the Coulomb-corrected action along analytic\nquantum orbits in the complex-time plane, taking soft recollisions under the\nCoulomb barrier into account. These recollisions in complex time and space\nprevent a separation into sub-barrier motion up to the \"tunnel exit\" and\nsubsequent classical dynamics. Instead, the entire quantum path up to the\ndetector determines the ionization probability.\n", "  The circular rotation speed of the Milky Way at the solar radius, Theta_o,\nhas been estimated to be 220 km/s by fitting the maximum velocity of HI\nemission as a function of Galactic longitude. This result is in tension with a\nrecent estimate of Theta_o=240 km/s, based on VLBI parallaxes and proper\nmotions from the BeSSeL and VERA surveys for large numbers of high-mass star\nforming regions across the Milky Way. We find that the rotation curve best\nfitted to the VLBI data is slightly curved, and that this curvature results in\na biased estimate of Theta_o from the HI data when a flat rotation curve is\nassumed. This relieves the tension between the methods and favors Theta_o=240\nkm/s.\n", "  Fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been identified as extragalactic sources which\ncan make a probe of turbulence in the intergalactic medium (IGM) and their host\ngalaxies. To account for the observed millisecond pulses caused by scatter\nbroadening, we examine a variety of possible models of electron density\nfluctuations in both the IGM and the host galaxy medium. We find that a\nshort-wave-dominated power-law spectrum of density, which may arise in highly\nsupersonic turbulence with pronounced local dense structures of\nshock-compressed gas in the host interstellar medium (ISM), can produce the\nrequired density enhancements at sufficiently small scales to interpret the\nscattering timescale of FRBs. It implies that an FRB residing in a galaxy with\nefficient star formation in action tends to have a broadened pulse. The scaling\nof the scattering time with dispersion measure (DM) in the host galaxy varies\nin different turbulence and scattering regimes. The host galaxy can be the\nmajor origin of scatter broadening, but contribute to a small fraction of the\ntotal DM. We also find that the sheet-like structure of density in the host ISM\nassociated with folded magnetic fields in a viscosity-dominated regime of\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence cannot give rise to strong scattering.\nFurthermore, valuable insights into the IGM turbulence concerning the detailed\nspatial structure of density and magnetic field can be gained from the observed\nscattering timescale of FRBs. Our results are in favor of the suppression of\nmicro-plasma instabilities and the validity of collisional-MHD description of\nturbulence properties in the collisionless IGM.\n", "  In this work the Casimir{Polder interaction energy between a rubidium atom\nand a disordered graphene sheet is investigated beyond the Dirac cone\napproximation by means of accurate real-space calculations. As a model of\ndefected graphene, we consider a tight-binding model of \\Pi-electrons on a\nhoneycomb lattice with a small concentration of point defects. The optical\nresponse of the graphene sheet is evaluated with full spectral resolution by\nmeans of exact Chebyshev polynomial expansions of the Kubo formula in large\nlattices with in excess of ten million atoms. At low temperatures, the optical\nresponse of defected graphene is found to display two qualitatively distinct\nbehavior with a clear transition around non-zero Fermi energy, \\mu~\\mu*. In the\nvicinity of the Dirac point, the imaginary part of optical conductivity is\nnegative for low frequencies while the real part is strongly suppressed. On the\nother hand, for high doping, it has the same features found in the Drude model\nwithin the Dirac cone approximation, namely, a Drude peak at small frequencies\nand a change of sign in the imaginary part above the interband threshold \\omega\n> 2\\mu. These characteristics translate into a non-monotonic behavior of the\nCasimir{Polder interaction energy with very small variation with doping in the\nvicinity of the neutrality point while having the same form of the interaction\ncalculated with Drude's model at high electronic density.\n", "  The reported observations of an unidentified X-ray line feature at $\\sim$3.5\nkeV have driven a lively discussion about its possible dark matter origin.\nMotivated by this, we have measured the \\emph{K}-shell X-ray spectra of highly\nionized bare sulfur ions following charge exchange with gaseous molecules in an\nelectron beam ion trap, as a source of or a contributor to this X-ray line. We\nproduce $\\mathrm{S}^{16+}$ and $\\mathrm{S}^{15+}$ ions and let them capture\nelectrons in collision with those molecules with the electron beam turned off\nwhile recording X-ray spectra. We observed a charge-exchanged-induced X-ray\nfeature at the Lyman series limit (3.47 $\\pm$ 0.06 keV). The inferred X-ray\nenergy is in full agreement with the reported astrophysical observations and\nsupports the novel scenario proposed by Gu and Kaastra (A \\& A \\textbf{584},\n{L11} (2015)).\n", "  Open clusters have been the focus of several exoplanet surveys but only a few\nplanets have so far been discovered. The \\emph{Kepler} spacecraft revealed an\nabundance of small planets around small, cool stars, therefore, such cluster\nmembers are prime targets for exoplanet transit searches. Kepler's new mission,\nK2, is targeting several open clusters and star-forming regions around the\necliptic to search for transiting planets around their low-mass constituents.\nHere, we report the discovery of the first transiting planet in the\nintermediate-age (800 Myr) Beehive cluster (Praesepe). K2-95 is a faint\n($\\mathrm{Kp = 15.5\\,mag}$) $\\mathrm{M3.0\\pm0.5}$ dwarf from K2's Campaign 5\nwith an effective temperature of $\\mathrm{3471 \\pm 124\\,K}$, approximately\nsolar metallicity and a radius of $\\mathrm{0.402 \\pm 0.050 \\,R_\\odot}$. We\ndetected a transiting planet with a radius of $\\mathrm{3.47^{+0.78}_{-0.53} \\,\nR_\\oplus}$ and an orbital period of 10.134 days. We combined photometry,\nmedium/high-resolution spectroscopy, adaptive optics/speckle imaging and\narchival survey images to rule out any false positive detection scenarios,\nvalidate the planet, and further characterize the system. The planet's radius\nis very unusual as M-dwarf field stars rarely have Neptune-sized transiting\nplanets. The comparatively large radius of K2-95b is consistent with the other\nrecently discovered cluster planets K2-25b (Hyades) and K2-33b (Upper\nScorpius), indicating systematic differences in their evolutionary states or\nformation. These discoveries from K2 provide a snapshot of planet formation and\nevolution in cluster environments and thus make excellent laboratories to test\ndifferences between field-star and cluster planet populations.\n", "  We demonstrate the possibility of designing efficient, non reciprocal\nfew-photon devices by exploiting the chiral coupling between two waveguide\nmodes and a single quantum emitter. We show how this system can induce\nnon-reciprocal photon transport at the single-photon level and act as an\noptical diode. Afterwards, we also show how the same system shows a\ntransistor-like behaviour for a two-photon input. The efficiency in both cases\nis shown to be large for feasible experimental implementations. Our results\nillustrate the potential of chiral waveguide-emitter couplings for applications\nin quantum circuitry.\n", "  Pegasus III (Peg III) is one of the few known ultra-faint stellar systems in\nthe outer halo of the Milky Way. We present the results from a follow-up\ncampaign with Magellan/IMACS and Keck/DEIMOS. Deep stellar photometry down to\n$r_0\\approx 25$ mag at 50% completeness level has allowed accurate measurements\nof its photometric and structural properties. The color-magnitude diagram of\nPeg III confirms that the stellar system is well described by an old\n($\\gtrsim12$ Gyr) and metal-poor ([Fe/H]$\\lesssim-2.0$ dex) stellar population\nat a heliocentric distance of $215\\pm12$ kpc. The revised half-light radius\n$r_{h}=53\\pm14$ pc, ellipticity $\\epsilon=0.38^{+0.22}_{-0.38}$, and total\nluminosity $M_{V}=-3.4\\pm0.4$ are in good agreement with the values quoted in\nour previous paper. We further report on the spectroscopic identification of\nseven, possibly eight member stars of Peg III. The Ca II triplet lines of the\nbrightest member stars indicate that Peg III contains stars with metallicity as\nlow as [Fe/H]=$-2.55\\pm0.15$ dex. Peg III has a systemic velocity of $-222.9\n\\pm 2.6$ km s$^{-1}$ and a velocity dispersion of $5.4^{+3.0}_{-2.5}$ km\ns$^{-1}$. The inferred dynamical mass within the half-light radius is\n$1.4^{+3.0}_{-1.1} \\times 10^6\\rm{M_{\\odot}}$ and the mass-to-light ratio\n$\\rm{M/L}$$_{V} = 1470^{+5660}_{-1240}$ $\\rm{M_{\\odot}/L_{\\odot}}$, providing\nfurther evidence that Peg III is a dwarf galaxy satellite. We find that Peg III\nand another distant dwarf satellite Pisces II lie relatively close to each\nother ($\\Delta d_{spatial}=43\\pm19$ kpc) and share similar radial velocities in\nthe Galactic standard-of-rest frame ($\\Delta v_{GSR}=12.3\\pm3.7$ km s$^{-1}$).\nThis suggests that they may share a common origin.\n", "  We study Ising antiferromagnets that have nearest-neighbour interactions on\nmultilayer triangular lattices with frustrated ($abc$ and $abab$) stacking, and\nmake comparisons with the unfrustrated ($aaa$) stacking. If interlayer\ncouplings are much weaker than in-plane ones, the paramagnetic phase of models\nwith frustrated stackings has a classical spin-liquid regime at low\ntemperature, in which correlations are strong both within and between planes,\nbut there is no long-range order. We investigate this regime using Monte Carlo\nsimulations and by mapping the spin models to coupled height models, which are\ntreated using renormalisation group methods and an analysis of the effects of\nvortex excitations. The classical spin-liquid regime is parametrically wide at\nsmall interlayer coupling in models with frustrated stackings. By contrast, for\nthe unfrustrated stacking there is no extended regime in which interlayer\ncorrelations are strong without three-dimensional order.\n", "  In the era of large astronomical surveys, photometric classification of\nsupernovae (SNe) has become an important research field due to limited\nspectroscopic resources for candidate follow-up and classification. In this\nwork, we present a method to photometrically classify type Ia supernovae based\non machine learning with redshifts that are derived from the SN light-curves.\nThis method is implemented on real data from the SNLS deferred pipeline, a\npurely photometric pipeline that identifies SNe Ia at high-redshifts\n($0.2<z<1.1$).\n  Our method consists of two stages: feature extraction (obtaining the SN\nredshift from photometry and estimating light-curve shape parameters) and\nmachine learning classification. We study the performance of different\nalgorithms such as Random Forest and Boosted Decision Trees. We evaluate the\nperformance using SN simulations and real data from the first 3 years of the\nSupernova Legacy Survey (SNLS), which contains large spectroscopically and\nphotometrically classified type Ia samples. Using the Area Under the Curve\n(AUC) metric, where perfect classification is given by 1, we find that our\nbest-performing classifier (Extreme Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) has an AUC\nof $0.98$.\n  We show that it is possible to obtain a large photometrically selected type\nIa SN sample with an estimated contamination of less than $5\\%$. When applied\nto data from the first three years of SNLS, we obtain 529 events. We\ninvestigate the differences between classifying simulated SNe, and real SN\nsurvey data. In particular, we find that applying a thorough set of selection\ncuts to the SN sample is essential for good classification. This work\ndemonstrates for the first time the feasibility of machine learning\nclassification in a high-$z$ SN survey with application to real SN data.\n", "  We present a brief introduction to QCD, the QCD phase diagram, and\nnon-equilibrium phenomena in QCD. We emphasize aspects of the theory that can\nbe addressed using computational methods, in particular euclidean path integral\nMonte Carlo, fluid dynamics, kinetic theory, classical field theory and\nholographic duality.\n", "  Broad-lined type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic-BL) are of great importance because\ntheir association with long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) holds the key to\ndeciphering the central engine of LGRBs, which refrains from being unveiled\ndespite decades of investigation. Among the two popularly hypothesized types of\ncentral engine, i.e., black holes and strongly magnetized neutron stars\n(magnetars), there is mounting evidence that the central engine of\nGRB-associated SNe (GRB-SNe) is rapidly rotating magnetars. Theoretical\nanalysis also suggests that magnetars could be the central engine of SNe Ic-BL.\nWhat puzzled the researchers is the fact that light curve modeling indicates\nthat as much as 0.2-0.5 solar mass of 56Ni was synthesized during the explosion\nof the SNe Ic-BL, which is unfortunately in direct conflict with current\nstate-of-the-art understanding of magnetar-powered 56Ni synthesis. Here we\npropose a dynamic model of magnetar-powered SNe to take into account the\nacceleration of the ejecta by the magnetar, as well as the thermalization of\nthe injected energy. Assuming that the SN kinetic energy comes exclusively from\nthe magnetar acceleration, we find that although a major fraction of the\nrotational energy of the magnetar is to accelerate the SNe ejecta, a tiny\nfraction of this energy deposited as thermal energy of the ejecta is enough to\nreduce the needed 56Ni to 0.06 solar mass for both SN 1997ef and SN 2007ru. We\ntherefore suggest that magnetars could power SNe Ic-BL both in aspects of\nenergetics and of 56Ni synthesis.\n", "  The model of minimal dilatonic gravity (MDG), called also the massive\nBranse-Dicke model with $\\omega =0$, is an alternative model of gravitation,\nwhich uses one Branse-Dicke gravitation-dilaton field $\\Phi$ and offers a\nsimultaneous explanation of the effects of dark energy (DE) and dark matter\n(DM). Here we present an extensive research of non-rotating neutron star models\nin MDG with four different realistic equations of state (EOS), which are in\nagreement with the latest observational data. The equations describing static\nspherically symmetric stars in MDG are solved numerically. The effects\ncorresponding to DE and DM are clearly seen and discussed.\n", "  The Waltz Spectrograph is a fiber-fed high-resolution \\'echelle spectrograph\nfor the 72 cm Waltz Telescope at the Landessternwarte, Heidelberg. It uses a\n31.6 lines/mm 63.5$^{\\circ}$ blaze angle \\'echelle grating in white-pupil\nconfiguration, providing a spectral resolving power of $R\\sim$65,000 covering\nthe spectral range between 450$-$800\\,nm in one CCD exposure. A prism is used\nfor cross-dispersion of \\'echelle orders. The spectrum is focused by a\ncommercial apochromat onto a 2k$\\times$2k CCD detector with 13.5$\\mu$m per\npixel. An exposure meter will be used to obtain precise photon-weighted\nmidpoints of observations, which will be used in the computation of the\nbarycentric corrections of measured radial velocities. A stabilized, newly\ndesigned iodine cell is employed for measuring radial velocities with high\nprecision. Our goal is to reach a radial velocity precision of better than 5\nm/s, providing an instrument with sufficient precision and sensitivity for the\ndiscovery of giant exoplanets. Here we describe the design of the Waltz\nspectrograph and early on-sky results.\n", "  We describe the remote facilities operated by the Southeastern Association\nfor Research in Astronomy (SARA), a consortium of colleges and universities in\nthe US partnered with Lowell Observatory, the Chilean National Telescope\nAllocation Committee, and the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias. SARA\nobservatories comprise a 0.96m telescope at Kitt Peak, Arizona; a 0.6m\ninstrument on Cerro Tololo, Chile; and the 1m Jacobus Kapteyn Telescope at the\nRoque de los Muchachos, La Palma, Spain. All are operated using standard VNC or\nRadmin protocols communicating with on-site PCs. Remote operation offers\nconsiderable flexibility in scheduling, allowing long-term observational\ncadences difficult to achieve with classical observing at remote facilities, as\nwell as obvious travel savings. Multiple observers at different locations can\nshare a telescope for training, educational use, or collaborative research\nprograms. Each telescope has a CCD system for optical imaging, using\nthermoelectric cooling to avoid the need for frequent local service, and a\nsecond CCD for offset guiding. The Arizona and Chile instruments also have\nfiber-fed echelle spectrographs. Switching between imaging and spectroscopy is\nvery rapid, so a night can easily accommodate mixed observing modes. We present\nsome sample observational programs. For the benefit of other groups organizing\nsimilar consortia, we describe the operating structure and principles of SARA,\nas well as some lessons learned from almost 20 years of remote operations.\n", "  Recent photoemission experiments \\cite{dessau} reveal that the excitations\nalong the nodal region in the strange metal of the cuprates, rather than\ncorresponding to poles in the single-particle Green function, exhibit power-law\nscaling as a function of frequency and temperature. Because such power-law\nscaling is indicative of a scale-invariant sector, as a first step, we\nperturbatively evaluate the electron self-energy due to interactions with\nscale-invariant unparticles. We focus on a $G_0W$ type diagram with an\ninteraction $W$ mediated by a bosonic scalar unparticle. We find that, in the\nhigh-temperature limit, the imaginary part of the self-energy\n$\\mathrm{Im}\\Sigma$ is linear in temperature. In the low-temperature limit,\n$\\mathrm{Im}\\Sigma$ exhibits the same power law in both temperature and\nfrequency, with an exponent that depends on the scaling dimension of an\nunparticle operator. Such behavior is qualitatively consistent with the\nexperimental observations. We then expand the unparticle propagator into\ncoherent and incoherent contributions, and study how the incoherent part\nviolates the density of states (DOS) and density-density correlation function\nsum rules (f-sum rule). Such violations can, in principle, be observed\nexperimentally. Our work indicates that the physical mechanism for the origin\nof the power-law scaling is the incoherent background, which is generated from\nthe Mott-scale physics.\n", "  We have observed short-range photoassociation of LiRb to the two lowest\nvibrational states of the $d\\,^3\\Pi$ potential. These $d\\,^3\\Pi$ molecules then\nspontaneously decay to vibrational levels of the $a^3\\,\\Sigma^+$ state with\ngeneration rates of $\\sim10^3$ molecules per second. This is the first\nobservation of many of these $a\\,^3\\Sigma^+$ levels. We observe an alternation\nof the peak heights in the rotational photoassociation spectrum that suggests a\n$p$-wave shape resonance in the scattering state. Franck-Condon overlap\ncalculations predict that photoassociation to higher vibrational levels of the\n$d\\,^3\\Pi$, in particular the sixth vibrational level, should populate the\nlowest vibrational level of the $a\\,^3\\Sigma^+$ state with a rate as high as\n$10^4$ molecules per second. These results encourage further work to explain\nour observed LiRb collisional physics using PECs. This work also motivates an\nexperimental search for short-range photoassociation to other bound molecules,\nsuch as the $c\\,^3\\Sigma^+$ or $b\\,^3\\Pi$, as prospects for preparing\nground-state molecules.\n", "  This is a cursory review of diffractive studies ( mostly elastic\nscattering)at the LHC with physical interpretation of the experimental data and\ncomments to related problems of theory.\n", "  Proxima b is a planet with a minimum mass of 1.3 MEarth orbiting within the\nhabitable zone (HZ) of Proxima Centauri, a very low-mass, active star and the\nSun's closest neighbor. Here we investigate a number of factors related to the\npotential habitability of Proxima b and its ability to maintain liquid water on\nits surface. We set the stage by estimating the current high-energy irradiance\nof the planet and show that the planet currently receives 30 times more EUV\nradiation than Earth and 250 times more X-rays. We compute the time evolution\nof the star's spectrum, which is essential for modeling the flux received over\nProxima b's lifetime. We also show that Proxima b's obliquity is likely null\nand its spin is either synchronous or in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, depending\non the planet's eccentricity and level of triaxiality. Next we consider the\nevolution of Proxima b's water inventory. We use our spectral energy\ndistribution to compute the hydrogen loss from the planet with an improved\nenergy-limited escape formalism. Despite the high level of stellar activity we\nfind that Proxima b is likely to have lost less than an Earth ocean's worth of\nhydrogen before it reached the HZ 100-200 Myr after its formation. The largest\nuncertainty in our work is the initial water budget, which is not constrained\nby planet formation models. We conclude that Proxima b is a viable candidate\nhabitable planet.\n", "  Radial velocity monitoring has found the signature of a $M \\sin i =\n1.3$~M$_\\oplus$ planet located within the Habitable Zone (HZ) of Proxima\nCentauri \\citep{Anglada16}. Despite a hotter past and an active host star the\nplanet Proxima~b could have retained enough volatiles to sustain surface\nhabitability \\citep{Ribas2016}. Here we use a 3D Global Climate Model (GCM) to\nsimulate Proxima b's atmosphere and water cycle for its two likely rotation\nmodes (1:1 and 3:2 spin-orbit resonances) while varying the unconstrained\nsurface water inventory and atmospheric greenhouse effect. We find that a broad\nrange of atmospheric compositions allow surface liquid water. On a\ntidally-locked planet with sufficient surface water inventory, liquid water is\nalways present, at least in the substellar region. With a non-synchronous\nrotation, this requires a minimum greenhouse warming ($\\sim$10~mbar of CO$_2$\nand 1~bar of N$_2$). If the planet is dryer, $\\sim$0.5~bar/1.5~bars of CO$_2$\n(respectively for asynchronous/synchronous rotation) suffice to prevent the\ntrapping of any arbitrary small water inventory into polar/nightside ice caps.\nWe produce reflection/emission spectra and phase curves for the simulated\nclimates. We find that atmospheric characterization will be possible by direct\nimaging with forthcoming large telescopes. The angular separation of $7\n\\lambda/D$ at 1~$\\mu$m (with the E-ELT) and a contrast of $\\sim$10$^{-7}$ will\nenable high-resolution spectroscopy and the search for molecular signatures,\nincluding H$_2$O, O$_2$, and CO$_2$. The observation of thermal phase curves\ncan be attempted with JWST, thanks to a contrast of $2\\times10^{-5}$ at\n10~$\\mu$m. Proxima~b will also be an exceptional target for future IR\ninterferometers. Within a decade it will be possible to image Proxima~b and\npossibly determine whether this exoplanet's surface is habitable.\n", "  We propose a method for the flux calibration of reverberation mapping spectra\nbased on accurate measurement of [O III] $\\lambda 5007$ emission by spectral\nfitting. The method can achieve better accuracy than the traditional method of\nvan Groningen & Wanders (1992), allowing reverberation mapping measurements for\nobject with variability amplitudes as low as $\\sim$ 5%. As a demonstration, we\nreanalyze the data of the Seyfert 1 galaxy MCG--6-30-15 taken from the 2008\ncampaign of the Lick AGN Monitoring Project, which previously failed to obtain\na time lag for this weakly variable object owing to a relatively large flux\ncalibration uncertainty. We detect a statistically significant rest-frame time\nlag of $6.38_{-2.69}^{+3.07}$ days between the H$\\beta$ and $V$-band light\ncurves. Combining this lag with FWHM(H$\\beta$) = $1933\\pm81$ $\\rm km~s^{-1}$\nand a virial coefficient of $f$ = 0.7, we derive a virial black hole mass of\n$3.26_{-1.40}^{+1.59}\\times10^6$ $M_{\\odot}$, which agrees well with previous\nestimates by other methods.\n", "  We present the first quick look analysis of data from nine {\\it AstroSat}'s\nLAXPC observations of GRS 1915+105 during March 2016 when the source had the\ncharacteristics of being in Radio-quiet $\\chi$ class. We find that a simple\nempirical model of a disk blackbody emission, with Comptonization and a broad\nGaussian Iron line can fit the time averaged 3--80 keV spectrum with a\nsystematic uncertainty of 1.5\\% and a background flux uncertainty of 4\\%. A\nsimple deadtime-corrected Poisson noise level spectrum matches well with the\nobserved high frequency power spectra till 50 kHz and as expected the data show\nno significant high frequency ($> 20$ Hz) features. Energy dependent power\nspectra reveal a strong low frequency (2 - 8 Hz) Quasi-periodic oscillation\n(LFQPO) and its harmonic along with broad band noise. The QPO frequency changes\nrapidly with flux (nearly 4 Hz in ~ 5 hours). With increasing QPO frequency, an\nexcess noise component appears significantly in the high energy regime (> 8\nkeV). At the QPO frequencies, the time-lag as a function of energy has a\nnon-monotonic behavior such that the lags decrease with energy till about 15\n-20 keV and then increase for higher energies. These first look results\nbenchmark the performance of LAXPC at high energies and confirms that its data\ncan be used for more sophisticated analysis such as flux or frequency-resolved\nspectro-timing studies.\n", "  We report the evaluation of the second order Zeeman shift in the continuous\natomic fountain clock FoCS-2. Because of the continuous operation and of its\ngeometrical constraints, the methods used in pulsed fountains are not\napplicable. We use here time-resolved Zeeman spectroscopy to probe the magnetic\nfield profile in the clock. The pulses of ac magnetic excitation allow us to\nspatially resolve the Zeeman frequency and to evaluate the Zeeman shift with a\nrelative uncertainty smaller than 10E-16.\n", "  We provide a comprehensive theoretical framework for describing the dynamics\nof a single trapped ion interacting with a neutral buffer gas, thus extending\nour previous studies on buffer-gas cooling of ions beyond the critical mass\nratio [B. H\\\"oltkemeier et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 233003 (2016)]. By\ntransforming the collisional processes into a frame, where the ion's\nmicromotion is assigned to the buffer gas atoms, our model allows one to\ninvestigate the influence of non-homogeneous buffer gas configurations as well\nas higher multipole orders of the radio-frequency trap in great detail.\nDepending on the neutral-to-ion mass ratio, three regimes of sympathetic\ncooling are identified which are characterized by the form of the ion's energy\ndistribution in equilibrium. We provide analytic expressions and numerical\nsimulations of the ion's energy distribution, spatial profile and cooling rates\nfor these different regimes. Based on these findings, a method for actively\ndecreasing the ion's energy by reducing the spatial expansion of the buffer gas\narises (Forced Sympathetic Cooling).\n", "  We present rest-frame optical spectra of 60 faint ($R_{AB}\\sim 27$; $L\\sim0.1\nL_*$) Ly$\\alpha$-selected galaxies (LAEs) at $z\\approx2.56$. The average LAE is\nconsistent with the extreme low-metallicity end of the continuum-selected\ngalaxy distribution at $z\\approx2-3$. In particular, the LAEs have extremely\nhigh [OIII] $\\lambda$5008/H$\\beta$ ratios (log([OIII]/H$\\beta$) $\\sim$ 0.8) and\nlow [NII] $\\lambda$6585/H$\\alpha$ ratios (log([NII]/H$\\alpha$) $<-1.15$). Using\nthe [OIII] $\\lambda$4364 auroral line, we find that the star-forming regions in\nfaint LAEs are characterized by high electron temperatures\n($T_e\\approx1.8\\times10^4$K), low oxygen abundances (12 + log(O/H) $\\approx$\n8.04, $Z_{neb}\\approx0.22Z_\\odot$), and high excitations with respect to more\nluminous galaxies. Our faintest LAEs have line ratios consistent with even\nlower metallicities, including six with 12 + log(O/H) $\\approx$ 6.9$-$7.4\n($Z_{neb}\\approx0.02-0.05Z_\\odot$). We interpret these observations in light of\nnew models of stellar evolution (including binary interactions). We find that\nstrong, hard ionizing continua are required to reproduce our observed line\nratios, suggesting that faint galaxies are efficient producers of ionizing\nphotons and important analogs of reionization-era galaxies. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate physical trends accompanying Ly$\\alpha$ emission across the largest\ncurrent sample of combined Ly$\\alpha$ and rest-optical galaxy spectroscopy,\nincluding 60 faint LAEs and 368 more luminous galaxies at similar redshifts. We\nfind that Ly$\\alpha$ emission is strongly correlated with nebular excitation\nand ionization and weakly correlated with dust attenuation, suggesting that\nmetallicity plays a strong role in determining the observed properties of these\ngalaxies by modulating their stellar spectra, nebular excitation, and dust\ncontent.\n", "  Nighttime zenith sky spectral brightness in the 3.3 to 20 micron wavelength\nregion is reported for an observatory site nearby Eureka, on Ellesmere Island\nin the Canadian High Arctic. Measurements derive from an automated\nFourier-transform spectrograph which operated continuously there over three\nconsecutive winters. During that time the median through the most transparent\nportion of the Q window was 460 Jy/square-arcsec, falling below 32\nJy/square-arcsec in N band, and to sub-Jansky levels by M and shortwards;\nreaching only 36 mJy/square-arcsec within L. Nearly six decades of twice-daily\nballoonsonde launches from Eureka, together with contemporaneous meteorological\ndata plus a simple model allows characterization of background stability and\nextrapolation into K band. This suggests the study location has dark skies\nacross the whole thermal infrared spectrum, typically sub-200\nmicro-Jy/square-arcsec at 2.4 microns. That background is comparable to South\nPole, and more than an order of magnitude less than estimates for the best\ntemperate astronomical sites, all at much higher elevation. Considerations\nrelevant to future facilities, including for polar transient surveys, are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Stellar population synthesis models can now reproduce the photometry of old\nstellar systems (age $>$ 2 Gyr) in the near-infrared (NIR) bands at 3.4 and\n4.6$\\mu$m (WISE W1 $\\&$ W2 or IRAC 1 $\\&$ 2). In this paper we derive stellar\nmass-to-light ratios for these and optical bands, and confirm that the NIR M/L\nshows dramatically reduced sensitivity to both age and metallicity compared to\noptical bands, and further, that this behavior leads to significantly more\nrobust stellar masses for quiescent galaxies with [Fe/H] > -0.5 regardless of\nstar formation history (SFH). We then use realistic early-type galaxy SFHs and\nmetallicity distributions from the EAGLE simulations of galaxy formation to\ninvestigate two methods to determine the appropriate M/L for a galaxy: 1) We\nshow that the uncertainties introduced by an unknown SFH can be largely removed\nusing a spectroscopically inferred luminosity-weighted age and metallicity for\nthe population to select the appropriate single stellar population (SSP)\nequivalent M/L. Using this method, the maximum systematic error due to SFH on\nthe M/L of an early-type galaxy is $<$ 4$\\%$ at 3.4 $\\mu$m and typical\nuncertainties due to errors in the age and metallicity create scatter of\n$\\lesssim$13$\\%$. The equivalent values for optical bands are more than 2-3\ntimes greater, even before considering uncertainties associated with internal\ndust extinction. 2) We demonstrate that if the EAGLE SFHs and metallicities\naccurately reproduce the true properties of early-type galaxies, the use of an\niterative approach to select a mass dependent M/L can provide even more\naccurate stellar masses for early-type galaxies, with typical uncertainties $<$\n9$\\%$.\n", "  The hot gas in galaxy halos may account for a significant fraction of missing\nbaryons in galaxies, and some of these gases can be traced by high ionization\nabsorption systems in QSO UV spectra. Using high S/N ratio $ HST$/COS spectra,\nwe discovered a high ionization state system at $z=1.1912$ in the sightline\ntoward \\object{LBQS 1435-0134}, and two-components absorption lines are matched\nfor Mg X, Ne VIII, Ne VI, O VI, Ne V, O V, Ne IV, O IV, N IV, O III, and H I.\nMg X, detected for the first time ($5.8 \\sigma$), is a particularly direct\ntracer of hot galactic halos, as its peak ion fraction occurs near\n$10^{6.1}\\rm~ K$, about the temperature of a virialized hot galaxy halo of mass\n$\\sim 0.5 M^*$. With Mg X and NeVIII, a photoionization model cannot reproduce\nthe observed column densities with path lengths of galaxy halos. For\ncollisional ionization models, one or two temperature models do not produce\nacceptable fits, but a three temperature model or a power law model can produce\nthe observed results. In the power law model, ${\\rm d}N/{\\rm d}T = 10^{4.4\\pm\n2.2-[Z/X]} T^{1.55\\pm 0.41}$ with temperatures in the range $10^{4.39\\pm0.13}\n{\\rm~K} < T < 10^{6.04\\pm0.05}~ {\\rm K}$, the total hydrogen column density is\n$8.2 \\times 10^{19} (0.3Z_{\\odot}/Z) \\rm~ cm^{-2}$ and the positive power law\nindex indicates most of the mass is at the high temperature end. We suggest\nthat this absorption system is a hot volume-filled galaxy halo rather than\ninteraction layers between the hot halo and cool clouds. The temperature\ndependence of the column density is likely due to the local mixture of multiple\nphase gases.\n", "  We present the results of the simultaneous observation of the giant radio\npulses (GRPs) from the Crab pulsar at 0.3, 1.6, 2.2, 6.7, and 8.4 GHz with four\ntelescopes in Japan. We obtain 3194 and 272 GRPs occurring at the main pulse\nand the interpulse phases, respectively. A few GRPs detected at both 0.3 and\n8.4 GHz are the most wide-band samples ever reported. In the frequency range\nfrom 0.3 to 2.2 GHz, we find that about 70\\% or more of the GRP spectra are\nconsistent with single power laws and the spectral indices of them are\ndistributed from $-4$ to $-1$. We also find that a significant number of GRPs\nhave such a hard spectral index (approximately $-1$) that the fluence at 0.3\nGHz is below the detection limit (\"dim-hard\" GRPs). Stacking light curves of\nsuch dim-hard GRPs at 0.3 GHz, we detect consistent enhancement compared to the\noff-GRP light curve. Our samples show apparent correlations between the\nfluences and the spectral hardness, which indicates that more energetic GRPs\ntend to show softer spectra. Our comprehensive studies on the GRP spectra are\nuseful materials to verify the GRP model of fast radio bursts in future\nobservations.\n", "  The model of the current paper is an extension of a previous publication,\nwherein we used the leaky integrate-and-fire model on a regular lattice with\nperiodic boundary conditions, and introduced the temporal complexity as a\ngenuine signature of criticality. In that work, the power-law distribution of\nneural avalanches was manifestation of supercriticality rather than\ncriticality. Here, however, we show that continuous solution of the model and\nreplacing the stochastic noise with a Gaussian zero-mean noise leads to the\ncoincidence of power-law display of temporal complexity and spatiotemporal\npatterns of neural avalanches at the critical point. We conclude that the\nsource of inconsistency may in fact be a numerical artifact originated by the\ndiscrete description of the model, which may imply slow numerical convergence\nof avalanche distribution compared to temporal complexity.\n", "  We study the influence of external electric, $E$, and magnetic, $B$, fields\nparallel to each other, and of a chiral chemical potential, $\\mu_5$, on the\nchiral phase transition of Quantum Chromodynamics. Our theoretical framework is\na Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with a contact interaction. Within this model we\ncompute the critical temperature of chiral symmetry restoration, $T_c$, as a\nfunction of the chiral chemical potential and field strengths. We find that the\nfields inhibit and $\\mu_5$ enhances chiral symmetry breaking, in agreement with\nprevious studies.\n", "  [PASJ Review Paper]\n  Rotation curves are the basic tool for deriving the distribution of mass in\nspiral galaxies. In this review, we describe various methods to measure\nrotation curves in the Milky Way and spiral galaxies. We then describe two\nmajor methods to calculate the mass distribution using the rotation curve. By\nthe direct method, the mass is calculated from rotation velocities without\nemploying mass models. By the decomposition method, the rotation curve is\ndeconvolved into multiple mass components by model fitting assuming a black\nhole, bulge, exponential disk and dark halo. The decomposition is useful for\nstatistical correlation analyses among the dynamical parameters of the mass\ncomponents. We also review recent observations and derived results.\n  ( Full resolution copy is available at URL:\nhttp://www.ioa.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~sofue/htdocs/PASJreview2016/ )\n", "  We study metal depletion due to dust in the interstellar medium (ISM) to\ninfer the properties of dust grains and characterize the metal and dust content\nof galaxies, down to low metallicity and intermediate redshift z. We provide\nmetal column densities and abundances of a sample of 70 damped Lyman-{\\alpha}\nabsorbers (DLAs) towards quasars, observed at high spectral resolution with the\nVery Large Telescope (VLT) Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES).\nThis is the largest sample of phosphorus abundances measured in DLAs so far. We\nuse literature measurements for Galactic clouds to cover the high-metallicity\nend. We discover tight (scatter <= 0.2 dex) correlations between [Zn/Fe] and\nthe observed relative abundances from dust depletion. This implies that grain\ngrowth in the ISM is an important process of dust production. These sequences\nare continuous in [Zn/Fe] from dust-free to dusty DLAs, and to Galactic clouds,\nsuggesting that the availability of refractory metals in the ISM is crucial for\ndust production, regardless of the star formation history. We observe [S/Zn] up\nto ~ 0.25 dex in DLAs, which is broadly consistent with Galactic stellar\nabundances. Furthermore, we find a good agreement between the nucleosynthetic\npattern of Galactic halo stars and our observations of the least dusty DLAs.\nThis supports recent star formation in low-metallicity DLAs. The derived\ndepletions of Zn, O, P, S, Si, Mg, Mn, Cr, and Fe correlate with [Zn/Fe], with\nsteeper slopes for more refractory elements. P is mostly not affected by dust\ndepletion. We present canonical depletion patterns, to be used as reference in\nfuture studies of relative abundances and depletion. We derive the total\n(dust-corrected) metallicity, typically -2 <= [M/H]tot <= 0 for DLAs, and\nscattered around solar metallicity for the Galactic ISM. The dust-to-metal\nratio increases with metallicity... [abridged]\n", "  Inflation occurring at energy densities less than (10$^{14}$ GeV)$^4$\nproduces tensor perturbations too small to be measured by cosmological surveys.\nHowever, we show that it is possible to probe low scale inflation by measuring\nthe mass of the inflaton at low energy experiments. Detection prospects and\ncosmological constraints are determined for low scale quartic hilltop models of\ninflation paired with a curvaton field, which imprints the spectrum of scalar\nperturbations observed in large scale structure and on the cosmic microwave\nbackground. With cosmological constraints applied, low scale quartic inflation\nat energies GeV--PeV, can be mapped to an MeV--TeV mass inflaton resonance,\ndiscoverable through a Higgs portal coupling at upcoming collider and meson\ndecay experiments. It is demonstrated that low scale inflatons can have\ndetectably large couplings to Standard Model particles through a Higgs portal,\npermitting prompt reheating after inflation, without spoiling, through\nradiative corrections to the inflaton's self-coupling, the necessary flatness\nof a low scale inflationary potential. A characteristic particle spectrum for a\nquartic inflaton-curvaton pair is identified: to within an order of magnitude,\nthe mass of the curvaton can be predicted from the mass of the inflaton, and\nvice-versa. Low scale inflation Higgs portal sensitivity targets are found for\nexperiments like the LHC, SHiP, BEPC, and KEKB.\n", "  In order to study the potential in high precision CCD astrometry of irregular\nsatellites, we have made experimental observations for Himalia, the sixth and\nirregular satellite of Jupiter. A total of 185 CCD observations were obtained\nby using the 2.4 m telescope and 1 m telescope at Yunnan Observatories over ten\nnights. Preliminary analysis for the observations were made, including the\ngeometric distortion, the atmospheric refraction, and also the phase effect.\nAll positions of Himalia are measured relative to the reference stars from the\ncatalogue UCAC4 in each CCD field of view. The theoretical positions of Himalia\nwere retrieved from the IMCCE, while the positions of Jupiter were obtained\nbased on the planetary theory INPOP13C. The results show that the mean (O-C)\n(observed minus computed) residuals are -0.004 and -0.002 arcsec in right\nascension and declination, respectively. The standard deviation of (O-C)\nresiduals are estimated at about 0.04 arcsec in each direction.\n", "  The $e^+e^-\\to K^+K^-$ cross section is measured in the center-of-mass energy\nrange $1.05-2.00$ GeV at the SND detector. The measurement is based on data\nwith an integrated luminosity of 35 pb$^{-1}$ collected at the VEPP-2000\n$e^+e^-$-collider. The obtained results are consistent with the previous most\naccurate data obtained in the BABAR experiment and have a comparable accuracy.\n", "  We are conducting a survey for extreme solar system objects to understand\nSedna and 2012 VP113 and determine if an unknown massive planet exists in the\nouter solar system. Two new objects, 2014 SR349 and 2013 FT28, are extreme\ndetached trans-Neptunian objects, with a>150 AU and perihelia well beyond\nNeptune (q>40 AU). Both new objects have orbits with arguments of perihelia\nwithin the range of clustering of this angle for other extreme objects. One of\nthese objects, 2014 SR349, has a longitude of perihelion similar to the other\nextreme objects, but 2013 FT28 is about 180 degrees away or anti-aligned in its\nlongitude of perihelion. We also discovered the first outer Oort cloud object\nwith a perihelion beyond Neptune, 2014 FE72. We discuss these and other\ninteresting objects discovered in our ongoing survey. All the high semi-major\naxis (a>150 AU) and high perihelion (q>35 AU) bodies follow the previously\nidentified argument of perihelion clustering as first reported and explained as\nbeing from an unknown massive planet by Trujillo and Sheppard (2014), which\nsome have called Planet X or Planet 9. Finally, with the discovery of 2013\nFT28, we find that the longitude of perihelion is significantly correlated with\nthe argument of perihelion and orbit pole angle for all extreme objects. This\nprevious unnoticed correlation is further evidence of an unknown massive planet\non an eccentric inclined orbit, as extreme eccentric objects with perihelia on\nopposite sides of the sky (180 degree longitude of perihelion differences)\nwould approach the inclined eccentric planet at opposite points in their\norbits, thus making the extreme objects prefer to stay away from opposite\necliptic latitudes to avoid the planet (i.e. opposite argument of perihelia or\npole angles).\n", "  Herschel FIR imaging and spectroscopy were taken at several epochs to probe\nthe central point source and the extended environment of V838 Mon. PACS and\nSPIRE maps were used to obtain photometry of the near and far dust around V838\nMon. Fitting reveals 0.5-0.6 solar masses of ~19K dust in the environs (~2.7pc)\nsurrounding the star. The surface-integrated infrared flux (signifying the\nthermal light echo) and derived dust properties do not vary significantly\nbetween the epochs. We also fit the SED of the point source. As the peak of the\nSED lies outside the Herschel spectral range, it is only by incorporating data\nfrom other observatories and epochs that we can perform useful fitting; with\nthis we explicitly assume no evolution of the point source between the epochs.\nWe find warm dust with a temperature of ~300K distributed over a radius of\n150-200AU. PACS and SPIRE spectra were also used to detect emission lines from\nthe extended environment around the star. We fit the far-infrared lines of CO\narising from the point source, from an extended environment around V838 Mon.\nAssuming a model of a spherical shell for this gas, we find that the CO appears\nto arise from two temperature zones: a cold zone (Tkin ~18K) that could be\nassociated with the ISM or possibly with a cold layer in the outermost part of\nthe shell, and a warm (Tkin ~400K) zone that is associated with the extended\nenvironment of V838 Mon within a region of radius of ~210AU. The SiO lines\narise from a warm/hot zone. We did not fit the lines of H2O as they are far\nmore dependent on the model assumed.\n", "  We have carried out new, high-frequency, high-time-resolution observations of\nthe Crab pulsar. Combining these with our previous data, we characterize bright\nsingle pulses associated with the Main Pulse, both the Low-Frequency and\nHigh-Frequency Interpulses, and the two High-Frequency Components. Our data\ninclude observations at frequencies ranging from 1 to 43 GHz with time\nresolution down to a fraction of a nanosecond. We find at least two types of\nemission physics are operating in this pulsar. Both Main Pulses and\nLow-Frequency Interpulses, up to about 10 GHz, are characterized by nanoshot\nemission - overlapping clumps of narrow-band nanoshots, each with its own\npolarization signature. High-Frequency Interpulses, between 5 and 30 GHz, are\ncharacterized by spectral band emission - linearly polarized emission\ncontaining about 30 proportionately spaced spectral bands. We cannot say\nwhether the longer-duration High-Frequency Component pulses are due to a\nscattering process, or if they come from yet another type of emission physics.\n", "  We report our observations of very bright prompt optical and reverse shock\n(RS) optical emission of GRB 140512A and analyze its multi-wavelength data\nobserved with the {\\em Swift} and {\\em Fermi} missions. It is found that the\njoint optical-X-ray-gamma-ray spectrum with our first optical detection\n(R=13.09 mag) at $T_0+136$ seconds during the second episode of the prompt\ngamma-rays can be fit by a single power-law with index $-1.32\\pm 0.01$. Our\nempirical fit to the afterglow lightcurves indicates that the observed bright\noptical afterglow with R=13.00 mag at the peak time is consistent with\npredictions of the RS and forward shock (FS) emission of external shock models.\nJoint optical-X-ray afterglow spectrum is well fit with an absorbed single\npower-law, with an index evolving with time from $-1.86\\pm 0.01$ at the peak\ntime to $-1.57\\pm 0.01$ at late epoch, which could be due to the evolution of\nthe ratio of the RS to FS emission fluxes. We fit the lightcurves with standard\nexternal models, and derive the physical properties of the outflow. It is found\nthat the ratio $R_B\\equiv\\epsilon_{\\rm B, r}/\\epsilon_{\\rm B, f}$ is 8187,\nindicating a high magnetization degree in the RS region. Measuring the relative\nradiation efficiency with $R_e\\equiv\\epsilon_{\\rm e, r}/\\epsilon_{\\rm e, f}$,\nwe have $R_e= 0.02$, implying the radiation efficiency of the RS is much lower\nthan that in FS. We also show that the $R_B$ of GRBs 990123, 090102, and\n130427A are similar to that of GRB 140512A and their apparent difference may be\nmainly attributed to the difference of the jet kinetic energy, initial Lorentz\nfactor, and medium density among them.\n", "  We report on a source of heralded narrowband (3MHz) single photons compatible\nwith solid-state spin-wave quantum memories based on praseodymium doped\ncrystals. Widely non-degenerate narrow-band photon pairs are generated using\ncavity enhanced down conversion. One photon from the pair is at telecom\nwavelengths and serves as heralding signal, while the heralded single photon is\nat 606nm, resonant with an optical transition in Pr:YSO. The source offers a\nheralding efficiency of 28% and a generation rate exceeding 2000 pairs/mW in a\nsingle-mode. The single photon nature of the heralded field is confirmed by a\ndirect antibunching measurement, with a measured antibunching parameter down to\n0.010(4). Moreover, we investigate in detail photon cross- and autocorrelation\nfunctions proving non-classical correlations between the two photons. The\nresults presented in this paper represent significant improvement over the\nstate of the art and offer prospects for the demonstration of single photon\nspin-wave storage in an on-demand solid state quantum memory, heralded by a\ntelecom photon.\n", "  We present a targeted search for blazar flux-correlated high-energy\n($\\varepsilon_\\nu > 1$ TeV) neutrinos from six bright northern blazars, using\nthe public database of northern-hemisphere neutrinos detected during \"IC40\"\n40-string operations of the IceCube neutrino observatory (April 2008 to May\n2009). Our six targeted blazars are subjects of long-term monitoring campaigns\nby the VERITAS TeV gamma-ray observatory. We use the publicly-available VERITAS\nlightcurves to identify periods of excess and flaring emission. These\npredefined intervals serve as our \"active temporal windows\" in a search for an\nexcess of neutrinos, relative to Poisson fluctuations of the near-isotropic\natmospheric neutrino background which dominates at these energies. After\ndefining the parameters of an optimized search, we confirm the expected Poisson\nbehavior with Monte Carlo simulations prior to testing for excess neutrinos in\nthe actual data. We make two searches: One for excess neutrinos associated with\nthe bright flares of Mrk 421 that occurred during the IC40 run, and one for\nexcess neutrinos associated with the brightest emission periods of five other\nblazars (Mrk 501, 1ES 0805+524, 1ES 1218+304, 3C66A, and W Comae), all\nsignificantly fainter than the Mrk 421 flares. We find no significant excess of\nneutrinos from the preselected blazar directions during the selected temporal\nwindows. We derive 90%-confidence upper limits on the number of expected\nflux-associated neutrinos from each search. These limits are consistent with\nprevious point-source searches and Fermi GeV flux-correlated searches. Our\nupper limits are sufficiently close to the physically-interesting regime that\nwe anticipate future analyses using already-collected data will either\nconstrain models or yield discovery of the first blazar-associated high-energy\nneutrinos.\n", "  The total contribution of diffuse halo gas to the galaxy baryon budget\nstrongly depends on its dominant ionization state. In this paper, we address\nthe physical conditions in the highly ionized circumgalactic medium (CGM)\ntraced by OVI absorption lines observed in COS-Halos spectra. We analyze the\nobserved ionic column densities, absorption-line widths and relative\nvelocities, along with the ratios of NV/OVI for 39 fitted Voigt profile\ncomponents of OVI. We compare these quantities with the predictions given by a\nwide range of ionization models. Photoionization models that include only\nextragalactic UV background radiation are ruled out; conservatively, the upper\nlimits to NV/OVI and measurements of N$_{\\rm OVI}$ imply unphysically large\npath lengths > 100 kpc. Furthermore, very broad OVI absorption (b > 40 km\ns$^{-1}$) is a defining characteristic of the CGM of star-forming L* galaxies.\nWe highlight two possible origins for the bulk of the observed OVI: (1) highly\nstructured gas clouds photoionized primarily by local high energy sources or\n(2) gas radiatively cooling on large scales behind a supersonic wind.\nApproximately 20% of circumgalactic OVI does not align with any low-ionization\nstate gas within $\\pm$50 km s$^{-1}$ and is found only in halos with M$_{\\rm\nhalo}$ < 10$^{12}$ M$_{\\odot}$. We suggest that this type of unmatched OVI\nabsorption traces the hot corona itself at a characteristic temperature of\n10$^{5.5}$ K. We discuss the implications of these very distinct physical\norigins for the dynamical state, gas cooling rates, and total baryonic content\nof L* gaseous halos.\n", "  We study the interplay between the Kondo effect and (color) superconductivity\nin doped Dirac metals with magnetic impurities and in quark matter with\ncolorful impurities. We first point out that the overscreened Kondo effect\narises in the normal state of these systems. Next the (color) superconducting\ngap is incorporated as a mean field and the phase diagram for a varying gap and\ntemperature is constructed nonperturbatively. A rich phase structure emerges\nfrom a competition of effects unique to a multichannel system. The\nKondo-screened phase is shown to disappear for a sufficiently large gap.\nPeculiarity of quark matter due to the confining property of non-Abelian gauge\nfields is noted. We also investigate the spectrum of sub-gap excited states,\ncalled Shiba states. Based on a model calculation and physical reasoning we\npredict that, as the coupling of the impurity to the bulk is increased, there\nwill be more than one quantum phase transition due to level crossing among\noverscreened states.\n", "  We analyze the effect of the cosmological expansion on the deflection of\nlight caused by a point mass, adopting the McVittie metric as the geometrical\ndescription of a pointlike lens embedded in an expanding universe. In the case\nof a generic, non-constant Hubble parameter $H$ we derive and approximately\nsolve the null geodesic equations, finding an expression for the bending angle\n$\\delta$, which we expand in powers of the mass-to-closest approach distance\nratio and of the impact parameter-to-lens distance ratio. It turns out that the\nleading order of the aforementioned expansion is the same as the one calculated\nfor the Schawarzschild metric and that cosmological corrections contribute to\n$\\delta$ only at sub-dominant orders. We explicitly calculate these\ncosmological corrections for the case of $H$ constant and find that they\nprovide a correction of order $10^{-11}$ on the lens mass estimate.\n", "  We study the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology in the\nWeyl-transverse (WTDiff) gravity in a general space-time dimension. The WTDiff\ngravity is invariant under both the local Weyl (conformal) transformation and\nthe volume preserving diffeormorphisms (transverse diffeomorphisms) and is\nbelieved to be equivalent to general relativity at least at the classical level\n(perhaps, even in the quantum regime). It is explicitly shown by solving the\nequations of motion that the FLRW metric is a classical solution in the WTDiff\ngravity only when the spatial metric is flat, that is, the Euclidean space, and\nthe lapse function is a nontrivial function of the scale factor.\n", "  The first generation of E-ELT instruments will include an optical-infrared\nHigh Resolution Spectrograph, conventionally indicated as EELT-HIRES, which\nwill be capable of providing unique breakthroughs in the fields of exoplanets,\nstar and planet formation, physics and evolution of stars and galaxies,\ncosmology and fundamental physics. A 2-year long phase A study for EELT-HIRES\nhas just started and will be performed by a consortium composed of institutes\nand organisations from Brazil, Chile, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland,\nPortugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom. In this paper we\ndescribe the science goals and the preliminary technical concept for EELT-HIRES\nwhich will be developed during the phase A, as well as its planned development\nand consortium organisation during the study.\n", "  The analytic structure of scattering amplitudes is restricted by Steinmann\nrelations, which enforce the vanishing of certain discontinuities of\ndiscontinuities. We show that these relations dramatically simplify the\nfunction space for the hexagon function bootstrap in planar maximally\nsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Armed with this simplification, along with\nthe constraints of dual conformal symmetry and Regge exponentiation, we obtain\nthe complete five-loop six-particle amplitude.\n", "  We continue our investigations of the development and importance of the\none-arm spiral instability in long-lived hypermassive neutron stars (HMNSs)\nformed in dynamical capture binary neutron star mergers. Employing hydrodynamic\nsimulations in full general relativity, we find that the one-arm instability is\ngeneric in that it can develop in HMNSs within a few tens of milliseconds after\nmerger for all equations of state in our survey. We find that mergers with\nstiffer equations of state tend to produce HMNSs with stronger $m=2$ azimuthal\nmode density deformations, and weaker $m=1$ components, relative to softer\nequations of state. We also find that for equations of state that can give rise\nto double-core HMNSs, large $m=1$ density modes can already be present due to\nasymmetries in the two cores. This results in the generation of $l=2$, $m=1$\ngravitational wave modes even before the dominance of a one-arm mode that\nultimately arises following merger of the two cores. Our results further\nsuggest that stiffer equations of state give rise to HMNSs generating lower\n$m=1$ gravitational wave frequencies. Thus, if gravitational waves from the\none-arm instability are detected, they could in principle constrain the neutron\nstar equation of state. We estimate that, depending on the equation of state,\nthe one-arm mode could potentially be detectable by second generation\ngravitational wave detectors at $\\sim 10$ Mpc and by third generation ones at\n$\\sim 100$ Mpc. Finally, we provide estimates of the properties of dynamical\nejecta, as well as the accompanying kilonovae signatures.\n", "  Stellar populations contain the most important information about star clus-\nter formation and evolution. Until several decades ago, star clusters were\nbelieved to be ideal laboratories for studies of simple stellar populations\n(SSPs). However, discoveries of multiple stellar populations in Galactic\nglobular clusters have expanded our view on stellar populations in star\nclusters. They have simultaneously generated a number of controversies,\nparticularly as to whether young star clusters may have the same origin as old\nglobular clusters. In addition, extensive studies have revealed that the SSP\nscenario does not seem to hold for some intermediate-age and young star\nclusters either, thus making the origin of multiple stellar populations in star\nclusters even more complicated. Stellar population anomalies in numerous star\nclusters are well-documented, implying that the notion of star clusters as true\nSSPs faces serious challenges. In this review, we focus on stellar populations\nin massive clusters with different ages. We present the history and progress of\nresearch in this active field, as well as some of the most recent improvements,\nincluding observational results and scenar- ios that have been proposed to\nexplain the observations. Although our current ability to determine the origin\nof multiple stellar populations in star clusters is unsatisfactory, we propose\na number of promising projects that may contribute to a significantly improved\nunderstanding of this subject.\n", "  We analyse the testability of the type II radiative seesaw in which neutrino\nmass and dark matter (DM) are related at one-loop level. Under the constraints\nfrom DM relic density, direct and indirect detection, and invisible Higgs\ndecays, we find three possible regions of DM mass $M_{s_1}$ that can survive\nthe present and even the future experiments: (1) the Higgs resonance region\nwith $M_{s_1}\\sim M_h/2$, (2) the Higgs region with $M_{s_1}\\sim M_h$, and (3)\nthe coannihilation region with $M_{s_2}\\sim M_{s_1}$. Here $s_{1,2}$ are two\nscalar singlets with the lighter $s_1$ being the DM candidate. Based on DM\nproperties and direct collider constraints, we choose three benchmark points to\nillustrate the testability of this model at LHC. We perform a detailed\nsimulation of the four-lepton and tri-lepton signatures at 13 (14) TeV LHC.\nWhile both signatures are found to be promising at all benchmark points, the\ntri-lepton one is even better: it is possible to reach the $5\\sigma$\nsignificance with an integrated luminosity of 100/fb.\n", "  In 2016 May, the intermediate polar FO~Aqr was detected in a low state for\nthe first time in its observational history. We report time-resolved photometry\nof the system during its initial recovery from this faint state. Our data,\nwhich includes high-speed photometry with cadences of just 2 sec, shows the\nexistence of very strong periodicities at 22.5 min and 11.26 min, equivalent to\nthe spin-orbit beat frequency and twice its value, respectively. A pulse at the\nspin frequency is also present but at a much lower amplitude than is normally\nobserved in the bright state. By comparing our power spectra with theoretical\nmodels, we infer that a substantial amount of accretion was stream-fed during\nour observations, in contrast to the disk-fed accretion that dominates the\nbright state. In addition, we find that FO~Aqr's rate of recovery has been\nunusually slow in comparison to rates of recovery seen in other magnetic\ncataclysmic variables, with an $e$-folding time of 115$\\pm7$ days. The recovery\nalso shows irregular variations in the median brightness of as much as 0.2~mag\nover a 10-day span. Finally, we show that the arrival times of the spin pulses\nare dependent upon the system's overall brightness.\n", "  We study supersonic Evershed downflows in a sunspot penumbra by means of high\nspatial resolution spectropolarimetric data acquired in the Fe I 617.3 nm line\nwith the CRISP instrument at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. Physical\nobservables, such as Dopplergrams calculated from line bisectors and Stokes V\nzero-crossing wavelengths, and Stokes V maps in the far red wing, are used to\nfind regions where supersonic Evershed downflows may exist. We retrieve the LOS\nvelocity and the magnetic field vector in these regions using two-component\ninversions of the observed Stokes profiles with the help of the SIR code. We\nfollow these regions during their lifetime to study their temporal behavior.\nFinally, we carry out a statistical analysis of the detected supersonic\ndownflows to characterize their physical properties. Supersonic downflows are\ncontained in compact patches moving outward, which are located in the mid and\nouter penumbra. They are observed as bright, roundish structures at the outer\nend of penumbral filaments that resemble penumbral grains. The patches may\nundergo fragmentations and mergings during their lifetime, even some of them\nare recurrents. Supersonic downflows are associated with strong and rather\nvertical magnetic fields with a reversed polarity compared to that of the\nsunspot. Our results suggest that downflows returning back to the solar surface\nwith supersonic velocities are abruptly stopped in dense deep layers and\nproduce a shock. Consequently, this shock enhances the temperature and is\ndetected as a bright grain in the continuum filtergrams, which could explain\nthe existence of outward moving grains in the mid and outer penumbra.\n", "  We study the properties of dipolar wave propagation in linear chains of\nisotropic particles with independent electric and magnetic response, embedded\nin vacuum. It is shown that the chain can support simultaneously right-handed\nmodes (RHM) and left-handed modes (LHM) of transverse-polarization. The LHM are\nsupported by the structure even if the chain's particles possess positive\npolarizabilities and no Bi-isotropy; the needed structural Bi-isotropy is\nprovided by the propagator instead of by the particle's local properties. In\ncontrast to the transverse modes in chains that consist of purely electric\nparticles that are inherently RHM, the LHM dispersion lacks the light-line\nbranch since their dipolar features are not aligned with the electric and\nmagnetic fields of a right-handed plane-wave solution in free space.\nFurthermore, it is shown that the spatial width of the LHM is significantly\nsmaller than that of the RHM. Excitation theory is developed, and it is shown\nthat the chain possesses modal and excitation asymmetries that can be used to\neliminate reflections from chain's termination.\n", "  We present the results of our ALMA observations of three AGN-dominated nuclei\nin optical Seyfert 1 galaxies (NGC 7469, I Zw 1, and IC 4329 A) and eleven\nluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) with various levels of infrared estimated\nenergetic contributions by AGNs at the HCN and HCO+ J=3-2 emission lines. The\nHCN and HCO+ J=3-2 emission lines are clearly detected at the main nuclei of\nall sources, except for IC 4329 A. The vibrationally excited (v2=1f) HCN J=3-2\nand HCO+ J=3-2 emission lines are simultaneously covered, and HCN v2=1f J=3-2\nemission line signatures are seen in the main nuclei of two LIRGs, IRAS\n12112+0305 and IRAS 22491-1808, neither of which show clear buried AGN\nsignatures in the infrared. If the vibrational excitation is dominated by\ninfrared radiative pumping, through the absorption of infrared 14 um photons,\nprimarily originating from AGN-heated hot dust emission, then these two LIRGs\nmay contain infrared-elusive, but (sub)millimeter-detectable, extremely deeply\nburied AGNs. These vibrationally excited emission lines are not detected in the\nthree AGN-dominated optical Seyfert 1 nuclei. However, the observed HCN v2=1f\nto v=0 flux ratios in these optical Seyferts are still consistent with the\nintrinsic flux ratios in LIRGs with detectable HCN v2=1f emission lines. The\nobserved HCN-to-HCO+ J=3-2 flux ratios tend to be higher in galactic nuclei\nwith luminous AGN signatures compared with starburst-dominated regions, as\npreviously seen at J=1-0 and J=4-3.\n", "  The Adler-Weisberger sum rule for the nucleon axial-vector charge, $g_A$,\noffers a unique signature of chiral symmetry and its breaking in QCD. Its\nderivation relies on both algebraic aspects of chiral symmetry, which guarantee\nthe convergence of the sum rule, and dynamical aspects of chiral symmetry\nbreaking---as exploited using chiral perturbation theory---which allow the\nrigorous inclusion of explicit chiral symmetry breaking effects due to\nlight-quark masses. The original derivations obtained the sum rule in the\nchiral limit and, without the benefit of chiral perturbation theory, made\nvarious attempts at extrapolating to non-vanishing pion masses. In this paper,\nthe leading, universal, chiral corrections to the chiral-limit sum rule are\nobtained. Using PDG data, a recent parametrization of the pion-nucleon total\ncross-sections in the resonance region given by the SAID group, as well as\nrecent Roy-Steiner equation determinations of subthreshold amplitudes,\nthreshold parameters, and correlated low-energy constants, the Adler-Weisberger\nsum rule is confronted with experimental data. With uncertainty estimates\nassociated with the cross-section parameterization, the Goldberger-Treimann\ndiscrepancy, and the truncation of the sum rule at $\\mathcal{O}(M_\\pi^4)$ in\nthe chiral expansion, this work finds $g_A = 1.248 \\pm 0.010 \\pm \\ 0.007 \\pm\n0.013$.\n", "  Electron acceleration in the solar corona is often associated with flares and\nthe eruption of twisted magnetic structures known as flux ropes. However, the\nlocations and mechanisms of such particle acceleration during the flare and\neruption are still subject to much investigation. Observing the exact sites of\nparticle acceleration can help confirm how the flare and eruption are initiated\nand how they evolve. Here we use the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly to analyse a\nflare and erupting flux rope on 2014-April-18, while observations from the\nNancay Radio Astronomy Facility allows us to diagnose the sites of electron\nacceleration during the eruption. Our analysis shows evidence for a pre-formed\nflux rope which slowly rises and becomes destabilised at the time of a C-class\nflare, plasma jet and the escape of >75 keV electrons from rope center into the\ncorona. As the eruption proceeds, continued acceleration of electrons with\nenergies of ~5 keV occurs above the flux rope for a period over 5 minutes. At\nflare peak, one site of electron acceleration is located close to the flare\nsite while another is driven by the erupting flux rope into the corona at\nspeeds of up to 400 km/s. Energetic electrons then fill the erupting volume,\neventually allowing the flux rope legs to be clearly imaged from radio sources\nat 150-445MHz. Following the analysis of Joshi et al. (2015), we conclude that\nthe sites of energetic electrons are consistent with flux rope eruption via a\ntether-cutting or flux cancellation scenario inside a magnetic fan-spine\nstructure. In total, our radio observations allow us to better understand the\nevolution of a flux rope eruption and its associated electron acceleration\nsites, from eruption initiation to propagation into the corona.\n", "  We enhance the Syer & Tremaine made-to-measure (M2M) particle method of\nstellar dynamical modelling to model simultaneously both kinematic data and\nabsorption line strength data thus creating a `chemo-M2M' modelling scheme. We\napply the enhanced method to four galaxies (NGC 1248, NGC 3838, NGC 4452, NGC\n4551) observed using the SAURON integral-field spectrograph as part of the\nATLAS3D programme. We are able to reproduce successfully the 2D line strength\ndata achieving mean chi^2 per bin values of ~1 with >95\\% of particles having\nconverged weights. Because M2M uses a 3D particle system, we are also able to\nexamine the underlying 3D line strength distributions. The extent to which\nthese distributions are plausible representations of real galaxies requires\nfurther consideration. Overall we consider the modelling exercise to be a\npromising first step in developing a `chemo-M2M' modelling system and in\nunderstanding some of the issues to be addressed. Whilst the made-to-measure\ntechniques developed have been applied to absorption line strength data, they\nare in fact general and may be of value in modelling other aspects of galaxies.\n", "  We report on the first high-resolution spectroscopic analysis of HE0020-1741,\na bright (V=12.9), ultra metal-poor ([Fe/H] = -4.1), carbon-enhanced ([C/Fe] =\n+1.7) star selected from the Hamburg/ESO Survey. This star exhibits low\nabundances of neutron-capture elements ([Ba/Fe] = -1.1), and an absolute carbon\nabundance A(C) = 6.1; based on either criterion, HE0020-1741 is sub-classified\nas a CEMP-no star. We show that the light-element abundance pattern of\nHE0020-1741 is consistent with predicted yields from a massive (M = 21.5 Mo),\nprimordial composition, supernova (SN) progenitor. We also compare the\nabundance patterns of other ultra metal-poor stars from the literature with\navailable measures of C, N, Na, Mg, and Fe abundances with an extensive grid of\nSN models (covering the mass range 10 Mo - 100 Mo), in order to probe the\nnature of their likely stellar progenitors. Our results suggest that at least\ntwo classes of progenitors are required at [Fe/H] < -4.0, as the abundance\npatterns for more than half of the sample studied in this work (7 out of 12\nstars) cannot be easily reproduced by the predicted yields.\n", "  We revisit calculations of nebular hydrogen Lya and HeII 1640A line strengths\nfor population III galaxies, undergoing continuous and bursts of star\nformation. We focus on initial mass functions (IMFs) motivated by recent\ntheoretical studies, which generally span a lower range of stellar masses than\nearlier works. We also account for case-B departures and the stochastic\nsampling of the IMF. In agreement with previous works, we find that departures\nfrom case-B can enhance the Lya flux by a factor of a few, but we argue that\nthis enhancement is driven mainly by collisional excitation and ionization, and\nnot due to photoionization from the n = 2 state of atomic hydrogen. The\nincreased sensitivity of the Lya flux to the high-energy end of the galaxy\nspectrum makes it more subject to stochastic sampling of the IMF. The latter\nintroduces a dispersion in the predicted nebular line fluxes around the\ndeterministic value by as much as a factor of ~4. In contrast, the stochastic\nsampling of the IMF has less impact on the emerging Lyman Werner (LW) photon\nflux. When case-B departures and stochasticity effects are combined, nebular\nline emission from population III galaxies can be up to one order of magnitude\nbrighter than predicted by 'standard' calculations that do not include these\neffects. This enhances the prospects for detection with future facilities such\nas JWST and large, groundbased telescopes.\n", "  The nature of warm, ionized gas outside of galaxies may illuminate several\nkey galaxy evolutionary processes. A serendipitous observation by the MaNGA\nsurvey has revealed a large, asymmetric H$\\alpha$ complex with no optical\ncounterpart that extends $\\approx8\"$ ($\\approx6.3$ kpc) beyond the effective\nradius of a dusty, starbursting galaxy. This H$\\alpha$ extension is\napproximately three times the effective radius of the host galaxy and displays\na tail-like morphology. We analyze its gas-phase metallicities, gaseous\nkinematics, and emission-line ratios, and discuss whether this H$\\alpha$\nextension could be diffuse ionized gas, a gas accretion event, or something\nelse. We find that this warm, ionized gas structure is most consistent with gas\naccretion through recycled wind material, which could be an important process\nthat regulates the low-mass end of the galaxy stellar mass function.\n", "  We identify 709 arc-shaped mid-infrared nebula in 24 micron Spitzer Space\nTelescope or 22 micron Wide Field Infrared Explorer surveys of the Galactic\nPlane as probable dusty interstellar bowshocks powered by early-type stars.\nAbout 20% are visible at 8 microns or shorter mid-infrared wavelengths as well.\nThe vast majority (660) have no previous identification in the literature.\nThese extended infrared sources are strongly concentrated near Galactic\nmid-Plane with an angular scale height of ~0.6 degrees. All host a\nsymmetrically placed star implicated as the source of a stellar wind sweeping\nup interstellar material. These are candidate \"runaway\" stars potentially\nhaving high velocities in the reference frame of the local medium. Among the\n286 objects with measured proper motions, we find an unambiguous excess having\nvelocity vectors aligned with the infrared morphology --- kinematic evidence\nthat many of these are \"runaway\" stars with large peculiar motions responsible\nfor the bowshock signature. We discuss a population of \"in-situ\" bowshocks (103\nobjects) that face giant HII regions where the relative motions between the\nstar and ISM may be caused by bulk outflows from an overpressured bubble. We\nalso identify 58 objects that face 8 micron bright-rimmed clouds and apparently\nconstitute a sub-class of in-situ bowshocks where the stellar wind interacts\nwith a photo-evaporative flow from an eroding molecular cloud interface (i.e.,\n\"PEF bowshocks\"). Orientations of the arcuate nebulae exhibit a correlation\nover small angular scales, indicating that external influences such as HII\nregions are responsible for producing some bowshock nebulae. However, the vast\nmajority of this sample appear to be isolated (499 objects) from obvious\nexternal influences.\n", "  We report follow-up studies of 35 recently-discovered cataclysmic variables\n(CVs), 32 of which were found in large, automated synoptic sky surveys. The\nobjects were selected for observational tractability. For 34 of the objects we\npresent mean spectra and spectroscopic orbital periods, and for one more we\ngive an eclipse-based period. Thirty-two of the period determinations are new,\nand three of these refine published estimates based on superhump periods. The\nremaining three of our determinations confirm previously published periods.\nTwenty of the stars are confirmed or suspected dwarf novae with periods shorter\nthan 3 hours, but we also find three apparent polars (AM Her stars), and six\nsystems with P > 5 h, five of which have secondary stars visible in their\nspectra, from which we estimate distances when possible. The orbital period\ndistribution of this sample is very similar to that of previously discovered\nCVs.\n", "  Ground Level Enhancements (GLEs) of cosmic-ray intensity occur, on average,\nonce a year. Due to their rareness, studying the solar sources of GLEs is\nespecially important to approach understanding their origin. The SOL2001-12-26\neruptive-flare event responsible for GLE63 seems to be challenging in some\naspects. Deficient observations limited its understanding. Analysis of extra\nobservations found for this event provided new results shading light on the\nflare. This article addresses the observations of this flare with the Siberian\nSolar Radio Telescope (SSRT). Taking advantage of its instrumental\ncharacteristics, we analyze the detailed SSRT observations of a major\nlong-duration flare at 5.7 GHz without cleaning the images. The analysis\nconfirms that the source of GLE63 was associated with an event in active region\n9742 that comprised two flares. The first flare (04:30-05:03 UT) reached a GOES\nimportance of about M1.6. Two microwave sources were observed, whose brightness\ntemperatures at 5.7 GHz exceeded 10 MK. The main flare, up to the M7.1\nimportance, started at 05:04 UT, and occurred in strong magnetic fields. The\nobserved microwave sources reached about 250 MK. They were not static. Having\nappeared on the weaker-field periphery of the active region, the microwave\nsources moved toward each other nearly along the magnetic neutral line,\napproaching a stronger-field core of the active region, and then moved away\nfrom the neutral line like expanding ribbons. These motions rule out an\nassociation of the non-thermal microwave sources with a single flaring loop.\n", "  We plan to measure the angular diameters of a sample of Penn State-Torun\nPlanet Search (PTPS) giant exoplanet host star candidates using the Navy\nPrecision Optical Interferometer. The radii of evolved giant stars obtained\nusing spectroscopy are usually ill-defined because of the method's indirect\nnature and evolutionary model dependency. The star's radius is a critical\nparameter used to calculate luminosity and mass, which are often not well known\nfor giant stars. Therefore, this problem also affects the orbital period, mass,\nand surface temperature of the planet. Our interferometric observations will\nsignificantly decrease the errors for these parameters. We present preliminary\nresults from NPOI observations of six stars in the PTPS sample.\n", "  Supermassive black holes launching plasma jets at close to speed of light,\nproducing gamma-rays, have ubiquitously been found to be hosted by massive\nelliptical galaxies. Since elliptical galaxies are generally believed to be\nbuilt through galaxy mergers, active galactic nuclei (AGN) launching\nrelativistic jets are associated to the latest stages of galaxy evolution. We\nhave discovered a pseudo-bulge morphology in the host galaxy of the gamma-ray\nAGN PKS 2004-447. This is the first gamma-ray emitter radio loud AGN found to\nbe launched from a system where both black hole and host galaxy have been\nactively growing via secular processes. This is evidence for an alternative\nblack hole-galaxy co-evolutionary path to develop powerful relativistic jets\nthat is not merger-driven.\n", "  We study the origin of the cold molecular clumps in quasar outflows, recently\ndetected in CO and HCN emission. We first describe the physical properties of\nsuch radiation-driven outflows and show that a transition from a momentum- to\nan energy-driven flow must occur at a radial distance of R ~ 0.25 kpc. During\nthis transition, the shell of swept up material fragments due to\nRayleigh-Taylor instabilities, but these clumps contain little mass and are\nlikely to be rapidly ablated by the hot gas in which they are immersed. We then\nexplore an alternative scenario in which clumps form from thermal instabilities\nat R >~ 1 kpc, possibly containing enough dust to catalyze molecule formation.\nWe investigate this processes with 3D two-fluid (gas+dust) numerical\nsimulations of a kpc^3 patch of the outflow, including atomic and dust cooling,\nthermal conduction, dust sputtering, and photoionization from the QSO radiation\nfield. In all cases, dust grains are rapidly destroyed in ~10,000 years; and\nwhile some cold clumps form at later times, they are present only as transient\nfeatures, which disappear as cooling becomes more widespread. In fact, we only\nfind a stable two-phase medium with dense clumps if we artificially enhance the\nQSO radiation field by a factor 100. This result, together with the complete\ndestruction of dust grains, renders the interpretation of molecular outflows a\nvery challenging problem.\n", "  We present a theoretical investigation of terahertz (THz) generation in\nlaser-induced gas plasmas. The work is strongly motivated by recent\nexperimental results on micro-plasmas, but our general findings are not limited\nto such a configuration. The electrons and ions are created by\ntunnel-ionization of neutral atoms, and the resulting plasma is heated by\ncollisions. Electrons are driven by electromagnetic, convective and diffusive\nsources and produce a macroscopic current which is responsible for THz\nemission. The model naturally includes both, ionization current and\ntransition-Cherenkov mechanisms for THz emission, which are usually\ninvestigated separately in the literature. The latter mechanism is shown to\ndominate for single-color multi-cycle lasers pulses, where the observed THz\nradiation originates from longitudinal electron currents. However, we find that\nthe often discussed oscillations at the plasma frequency do not contribute to\nthe THz emission spectrum. In order to predict the scaling of the conversion\nefficiency with pulse energy and focusing conditions, we propose a simplified\ndescription that is in excellent agreement with rigorous particle-in-cell\nsimulations.\n", "  We study superconducting instability from orbital nematic fluctuations in a\nminimal model consisting of the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals, and choose\nmodel parameters which capture the typical Fermi surface geometry observed in\niron-based superconductors. We solve the Eliashberg equations down to low\ntemperatures with keeping the renormalization function and a full momentum\ndependence of the pairing gap. When superconductivity occurs in the tetragonal\nphase, we find that the pairing gap exhibits a weak momentum dependence over\nthe Fermi surfaces. The superconducting instability occurs also inside the\nnematic phase. When the $d_{xz}$ orbital is occupied more than the $d_{yz}$\norbital in the nematic phase, a larger (smaller) gap is realized on the\nFermi-surface parts, where the $d_{xz}$ ($d_{yz}$) orbital component is\ndominant, leading to a substantial momentum dependence of the pairing gap on\nthe hole Fermi surfaces. On the other hand, the momentum dependence of the gap\nis weak on the electron Fermi surfaces. We also find that while the leading\ninstability is the so-called $s_{++}$-wave symmetry, the second leading one is\n$d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry. In particular, these two states are nearly\ndegenerate in the tetragonal phase whereas such quasi-degeneracy is lifted in\nthe nematic phase and the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry changes to highly\nanisotropic $s$-wave symmetry.\n", "  We update the ingredients of the Gaussian streaming model (GSM) for the\nredshift-space clustering of biased tracers using the techniques of Lagrangian\nperturbation theory, effective field theory (EFT) and a generalized Lagrangian\nbias expansion. After relating the GSM to the cumulant expansion, we present\nnew results for the real-space correlation function, mean pairwise velocity and\npairwise velocity dispersion including counter terms from EFT and bias terms\nthrough third order in the linear density, its leading derivatives and its\nshear up to second order. We discuss the connection to the Gaussian peaks\nformalism. We compare the ingredients of the GSM to a suite of large N-body\nsimulations, and show the performance of the theory on the low order multipoles\nof the redshift-space correlation function and power spectrum. We highlight the\nimportance of a general biasing scheme, which we find to be as important as\nhigher-order corrections due to non-linear evolution for the halos we consider\non the scales of interest to us.\n", "  We present a high sensitivity radio continuum survey at 6 and 1.3$\\,$cm using\nthe Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array towards a sample of 58 high-mass star\nforming regions. Our sample was chosen from dust clumps within infrared dark\nclouds with and without IR sources (CMC-IRs, CMCs, respectively), and hot\nmolecular cores (HMCs), with no previous, or relatively weak radio continuum\ndetection at the $1\\,$mJy level. Due to the improvement in the continuum\nsensitivity of the VLA, this survey achieved map rms levels of $\\sim$ 3-10\n$\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ at sub-arcsecond angular resolution. We extracted 70\ncentimeter continuum sources associated with 1.2$\\,$mm dust clumps. Most\nsources are weak, compact, and are prime candidates for high-mass protostars.\nDetection rates of radio sources associated with the mm dust clumps for CMCs,\nCMC-IRs and HMCs are 6$\\%$, 53$\\%$ and 100$\\%$, respectively. This result is\nconsistent with increasing high-mass star formation activity from CMCs to HMCs.\nThe radio sources located within HMCs and CMC-IRs occur close to the dust clump\ncenters with a median offset from it of 12,000$\\,$AU and 4,000$\\,$AU,\nrespectively. We calculated 5 - 25$\\,$GHz spectral indices using power law fits\nand obtain a median value of 0.5 (i.e., flux increasing with frequency),\nsuggestive of thermal emission from ionized jets. In this paper we describe the\nsample, observations, and detections. The analysis and discussion will be\npresented in Paper II.\n", "  We conducted VLA C-configuration observations to measure positions and\nluminosities of Galactic Class II 6.7 GHz methanol masers and their associated\nultra-compact H II regions. The spectral resolution was 3.90625 kHz and the\ncontinuum sensitivity reached 45 \\uJypb. We mapped 372 methanol masers with\npeak flux densities of more than 2 Jy selected from the literature, 367 of them\nwere detected. Absolute positions have nominal uncertainties of 0.3 arcsec. In\nthis first paper on the data analysis, we present three catalogs, the first\ngives information on the strongest feature of 367 methanol maser sources, and\nthe second on all detected maser spots. The third catalog present derived data\nof the 279 radio continuum sources found in the vicinity of maser sources.\nAmong them, 140 show evidence of physical association with maser sources. Our\ncatalogs list properties including distance, flux density, radial velocity and\nthe distribution of masers on the Galactic plane is then provided as well. We\nfound no significant relationship between luminosities of masers and their\nassociated radio continuum counterparts.\n", "  Measurements are presented of the cross section for the production of at\nleast four jets, of which at least two originate from b quarks, in\nproton-proton collisions. Data collected with the CMS detector at the LHC at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 7 TeV are used, corresponding to an integrated\nluminosity of 3 inverse picobarns. The cross section is measured as a function\nof the jet transverse momentum for pt > 20 GeV, and of the jet pseudorapidity\nfor abs(eta) < 2.4 (b jets), 4.7 (untagged jets). The correlations in azimuthal\nangle and pt between the jets are also studied. The inclusive cross section is\nmeasured to be sigma(pp to 2 b + 2 j + X) = 69 +/- 3 (stat) +/- 24 (syst) nb.\nThe eta and pt distributions of the four jets and the correlations between them\nare well reproduced by event generators that combine perturbative QCD\ncalculations at next-to-leading-order accuracy with contributions from parton\nshowers and multiparton interactions.\n", "  We present the first results of the High cadence Transient Survey (HiTS), a\nsurvey whose objective is to detect and follow up optical transients with\ncharacteristic timescales from hours to days, especially the earliest hours of\nsupernova (SN) explosions. HiTS uses the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) and a\ncustom made pipeline for image subtraction, candidate filtering and candidate\nvisualization, which runs in real-time to be able to react rapidly to the new\ntransients. We discuss the survey design, the technical challenges associated\nwith the real-time analysis of these large volumes of data and our first\nresults. In our 2013, 2014 and 2015 campaigns we have detected more than 120\nyoung SN candidates, but we did not find a clear signature from the short-lived\nSN shock breakouts (SBOs) originating after the core collapse of red supergiant\nstars, which was the initial science aim of this survey. Using the empirical\ndistribution of limiting-magnitudes from our observational campaigns we\nmeasured the expected recovery fraction of randomly injected SN light curves\nwhich included SBO optical peaks produced with models from Tominaga et al.\n(2011) and Nakar & Sari (2010). From this analysis we cannot rule out the\nmodels from Tominaga et al. (2011) under any reasonable distributions of\nprogenitor masses, but we can marginally rule out the brighter and longer-lived\nSBO models from Nakar & Sari (2010) under our best-guess distribution of\nprogenitor masses. Finally, we highlight the implications of this work for\nfuture massive datasets produced by astronomical observatories such as LSST.\n", "  One of the primary gravitational wave (GW) sources for pulsar timing arrays\n(PTAs) is the stochastic background formed by supermassive black holes binaries\n(SMBHBs). In this paper, we investigate how the environments of SMBHBs will\neffect the sensitivity of PTAs by deriving scaling laws for the signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) of the optimal cross-correlation statistic. The presence of gas and\nstars around SMBHBs will accelerate the merger at large distances, depleting\nthe GW stochastic background at low frequencies. We show that environmental\ninteractions may delay detection by a few years or more, depending on the PTA\nconfiguration and the frequency at which the dynamical evolution transitions\nfrom being dominated by environmental effects to GW-dominated.\n", "  We performed millimeter observations in CO lines toward the supernova remnant\n(SNR) HB 3. Substantial molecular gas around -45 km s^-1 is detected in the\nconjunction region between the SNR HB 3 and the nearby W3 complex. This\nmolecular gas is distributed along the radio continuum shell of the remnant.\nFurthermore, the shocked molecular gas indicated by line wing broadening\nfeatures is also distributed along the radio shell and inside it. By both\nmorphological correspondence and dynamical evidence, we confirm that the SNR HB\n3 is interacting with the -45 km s^-1 molecular cloud (MC), in essence, with\nthe nearby H II region/MC complex W3. The red-shifted line wing broadening\nfeatures indicate that the remnant is located at the nearside of the MC. With\nthis association, we could place the remnant at the same distance as the W3/W4\ncomplex, which is 1.95 +- 0.04 kpc. The spatial distribution of aggregated\nyoung stellar object candidates (YSOc) shows a correlation to the shocked\nmolecular strip associated with the remnant. We also find a binary clump of CO\nat (l = 132.94 deg, b = 1.12 deg) around -51.5 km s^-1 inside the projected\nextent of the remnant, and it is associated with significant mid-infrared\n(mid-IR) emission. The binary system also has a tail structure resembling the\ntidal tails of interacting galaxies. According to the analysis of CO emission\nlines, the larger clump in this binary system is about stable, and the smaller\nclump is significantly disturbed.\n", "  We apply a novel spectral graph technique, that of locally-biased\nsemi-supervised eigenvectors, to study the diversity of galaxies. This\ntechnique permits us to characterize empirically the natural variations in\nobserved spectra data, and we illustrate how this approach can be used in an\nexploratory manner to highlight both large-scale global as well as small-scale\nlocal structure in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data. We use this method in\na way that simultaneously takes into account the measurements of spectral lines\nas well as the continuum shape. Unlike Principal Component Analysis, this\nmethod does not assume that the Euclidean distance between galaxy spectra is a\ngood global measure of similarity between all spectra, but instead it only\nassumes that local difference information between similar spectra is reliable.\nMoreover, unlike other nonlinear dimensionality methods, this method can be\nused to characterize very finely both small-scale local as well as large-scale\nglobal properties of realistic noisy data. The power of the method is\ndemonstrated on the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample by illustrating that the derived\nembeddings of spectra carry an unprecedented amount of information. By using a\nstraightforward global or unsupervised variant, we observe that the main\nfeatures correlate strongly with star formation rate and that they clearly\nseparate active galactic nuclei. Computed parameters of the method can be used\nto describe line strengths and their interdependencies. By using a\nlocally-biased or semi-supervised variant, we are able to focus on typical\nvariations around specific objects of astronomical interest. We present several\nexamples illustrating that this approach can enable new discoveries in the data\nas well as a detailed understanding of very fine local structure that would\notherwise be overwhelmed by large-scale noise and global trends in the data.\n", "  We have resolved the scatter-broadened image of PSR B0329+54 and detected\nsubstructure within it. These results are not influenced by any extended\nstructure of a source but instead are directly attributed to the interstellar\nmedium. We obtained these results at 324 MHz with the ground-space\ninterferometer RadioAstron which included the space radio telescope (SRT),\nground-based Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope and 64-m Kalyazin Radio\nTelescope on baseline projections up to 330,000 km in 2013 November 22 and 2014\nJanuary 1 to 2. At short 15,000 to 35,000 km ground-space baseline projections\nthe visibility amplitude decreases with baseline length providing a direct\nmeasurement of the size of the scattering disk of 4.8$\\pm$0.8 mas. At longer\nbaselines no visibility detections from the scattering disk would be expected.\nHowever, significant detections were obtained with visibility amplitudes of 3\nto 5% of the maximum scattered around a mean and approximately constant up to\n330,000 km. These visibilities reflect substructure from scattering in the\ninterstellar medium and offer a new probe of ionized interstellar material. The\nsize of the diffraction spot near Earth is 17,000$\\pm$3,000 km. With the\nassumption of turbulent irregularities in the plasma of the interstellar\nmedium, we estimate that the effective scattering screen is located 0.6$\\pm$0.1\nof the distance from Earth toward the pulsar.\n", "  We present new Jansky Very Large Array observations of five pre-Swift\ngamma-ray bursts for which an ultraluminous (SFR > 100 M_sun/yr) dusty host\ngalaxy had previously been inferred from radio or submillimetre observations\ntaken within a few years after the burst. In four of the five cases we no\nlonger detect any source at the host location to limits much fainter than the\noriginal observations, ruling out the existence of an ultraluminous galaxy\nhosting any of these GRBs. We continue to detect a source at the position of\nGRB 980703, but it is much fainter than it was a decade ago and the inferred\nradio star-formation rate (~80 M_sun) is relatively modest. The radio\nflattening at 200-1000 days observed in the light curve of this GRB may have\nbeen caused by a decelerating counterjet oriented 180 degrees away from the\nviewer, although an unjetted wind model can also explain the data. Our results\neliminate all well-established pre-Swift ULIRG hosts, and all cases for which\nan unobscured GRB was found in a galaxy dominated by heavily-obscured\nstar-formation. When GRBs do occur in ULIRGs the afterglow is almost always\nobserved to be heavily obscured, consistent with the large dust opacities and\nhigh dust covering fractions characteristic of these systems.\n", "  We study the effect of humidity on the charge accumulation of polymer\ngranulates shaken vertically in a stainless steel container. The setup allows\nto control the humidity level from 5 % to 100 %RH while performing automated\ncharge measurements in a Faraday cup directly connected to the shaking\ncontainer. We find that samples of approximately 2000 polymer spheres become\nhighly charged at low humidity levels (<30 %RH), but acquire almost no charge\nfor humidity levels above 80 %RH. The transition between these two regimes does\ndepend on the material, as does the sign of the charge. For the latter we find\na correlation with the contact angle of the polymer with only very hydrophilic\nparticles attaining positive charges. We show that this humidity dependence of\ntribo-charging can be used to control segregation in shaken binary mixtures.\n", "  On April 23, 2014, the Swift satellite responded to a hard X-ray transient\ndetected by its Burst Alert Telescope, which turned out to be a stellar flare\nfrom a nearby, young M dwarf binary DG~CVn. We utilize observations at X-ray,\nUV, optical, and radio wavelengths to infer the properties of two large flares.\nThe X-ray spectrum of the primary outburst can be described over the 0.3-100\nkeV bandpass by either a single very high temperature plasma or a nonthermal\nthick-target bremsstrahlung model, and we rule out the nonthermal model based\non energetic grounds. The temperatures were the highest seen spectroscopically\nin a stellar flare, at T$_{X}$ of 290 MK. The first event was followed by a\ncomparably energetic event almost a day later. We constrain the photospheric\narea involved in each of the two flares to be $>$10$^{20}$ cm$^{2}$, and find\nevidence from flux ratios in the second event of contributions to the white\nlight flare emission in addition to the usual hot, T$\\sim$10$^{4}$K blackbody\nemission seen in the impulsive phase of flares. The radiated energy in X-rays\nand white light reveal these events to be the two most energetic X-ray flares\nobserved from an M dwarf, with X-ray radiated energies in the 0.3-10 keV\nbandpass of 4$\\times$10$^{35}$ and 9$\\times$10$^{35}$ erg, and optical flare\nenergies at E$_{V}$ of 2.8$\\times$10$^{34}$ and 5.2$\\times$10$^{34}$ erg,\nrespectively. The results presented here should be integrated into updated\nmodelling of the astrophysical impact of large stellar flares on close-in\nexoplanetary atmospheres.\n", "  We use a nonequilibrium implementation of the dynamical cluster approximation\n(DCA) to study the effect of short-range correlations on the dynamics of the\ntwo-dimensional Falicov-Kimball model after an interaction quench. As in the\ncase of single-site dynamical mean field theory, thermalization is absent in\nDCA simulations, and for quenches across the metal-insulator boundary,\nnearest-neighbor charge correlations in the nonthermal steady state are found\nto be larger than in the thermal state with identical energy. We investigate to\nwhat extent it is possible to define an effective temperature of the trapped\nstate after a quench. Based on the ratio between the lesser and retarded\nGreen's function we conclude that a roughly thermal distribution is reached\nwithin the energy intervals corresponding to the momentum-patch dependent\nsubbands of the spectral function. The effectively different chemical\npotentials of these distributions however lead to a very hot, or even negative,\neffective temperature in the energy intervals between these subbands.\n", "  We observe Arp 220, the nearest Ultra-Luminous Infrared Galaxy (ULIRG), over\n4 GHz in the K and Ka bands. We provide constraints for the\nkinematics,morphology, and identify molecular species on scales resolving both\nnuclei (0.6\" or 230 pc). We detect multiple molecular species, including\nhydroxyl in both cores. We tentatively detect H2O at 21.84 GHz in both nuclei,\nindicating the likely presence of maser emission. The observed frequency range\nalso contains metastable ammonia transitions from (J,K) = (1,1) to (5,5), as\nwell as the (9,9) inversion line, which, together are a well-known thermometer\nof dense molecular gas. Furthermore, the non-metastable (4,2) and (10,9) and\npossibly the (3,1) lines are also detected. We apply a standard temperature\nanalysis to Arp 220. However, the analysis is complicated in that standard LTE\nassumptions do not hold. There are indications that a substantial fraction of\nammonia could be in the non-metastable transitions as opposed to only the\nmetastable ones. Thus, the non-metastable transitions could be essential to\nconstraining the temperature. We compare all of these data to ALMA observations\nof this source, confirming the outflow previously observed by other tracers in\nboth nuclei.\n", "  We study the capture of WIMP dark matter by the Sun in the non-relativistic\neffective theory of dark matter self-interactions. The aim is to assess the\nimpact of self-interactions on the expected neutrino flux from the annihilation\nof WIMPs trapped in the Sun in a model independent manner. We consider all\nnon-relativistic Galilean invariant self-interaction operators that can arise\nfrom the exchange of a heavy particle of spin less than or equal to 1 for WIMPs\nof spin equal to 0, 1/2 and 1. We show that for interaction operators depending\nat most linearly on the momentum transfer, the WIMP-induced neutrino flux can\nbe enhanced by several orders of magnitude compared to the same flux in absence\nof self-interactions. This is true even for standard values of the thermally\naveraged annihilation cross-section. This conclusion impacts the analysis of\npresent and future observations performed at neutrino telescopes.\n", "  Observations of several protostellar jets show systematic differences in\nradial velocity transverse to the jet propagation direction, which have been\ninterpreted as evidence of rotation in the jets. In this paper we discuss the\norigin of these velocity shifts, and show that they could be originated by\nrotation in the flow, or by side to side asymmetries in the shock velocity,\nwhich could be due to asymmetries in the jet ejection velocity/density or in\nthe ambient medium. For typical poloidal jet velocities (~ 100-200 km/s), an\nasymmetry >~ 10% can produce velocity shifts comparable to those observed. We\nalso present three dimensional numerical simulations of rotating, precessing\nand asymmetric jets, and show that, even though for a given jet there is a\nclear degeneracy between these effects, a statistical analysis of jets with\ndifferent inclination angles can help to distinguish between the alternative\norigins of transverse velocity shifts. Our analysis indicate that side to side\nvelocities asymmetries could represent an important contribution to transverse\nvelocity shifts, being the most important contributor for large jet inclination\nangles (with respect the the plane of the sky), and can not be neglected when\ninterpreting the observations.\n", "  The orbital structure of the asteroid belt holds a record of the Solar\nSystem's dynamical history. The current belt only contains ${\\rm \\sim 10^{-3}}$\nEarth masses yet the asteroids' orbits are dynamically excited, with a large\nspread in eccentricity and inclination. In the context of models of terrestrial\nplanet formation, the belt may have been excited by Jupiter's orbital\nmigration. The terrestrial planets can also be reproduced without invoking a\nmigrating Jupiter; however, as it requires a severe mass deficit beyond Earth's\norbit, this model systematically under-excites the asteroid belt. Here we show\nthat the orbits of the asteroids may have been excited to their current state\nif Jupiter and Saturn's early orbits were chaotic. Stochastic variations in the\ngas giants' orbits cause resonances to continually jump across the main belt\nand excite the asteroids' orbits on a timescale of tens of millions of years.\nWhile hydrodynamical simulations show that the gas giants were likely in mean\nmotion resonance at the end of the gaseous disk phase, small perturbations\ncould have driven them into a chaotic but stable state. The gas giants' current\norbits were achieved later, during an instability in the outer Solar System.\nAlthough it is well known that the present-day Solar System exhibits chaotic\nbehavior, our results suggest that the early Solar System may also have been\nchaotic.\n", "  The exoplanet revolution is well underway. The last decade has seen\norder-of-magnitude increases in the number of known planets beyond the Solar\nsystem. Detailed characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres provide the best\nmeans for distinguishing the makeup of their outer layers, and the only hope\nfor understanding the interplay between initial composition chemistry,\ntemperature-pressure atmospheric profiles, dynamics and circulation. While\npioneering work on the observational side has produced the first important\ndetections of atmospheric molecules for the class of transiting exoplanets,\nimportant limitations are still present due to the lack of sys- tematic,\nrepeated measurements with optimized instrumentation at both visible (VIS) and\nnear-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. It is thus of fundamental importance to\nexplore quantitatively possible avenues for improvements. In this paper we\nreport initial results of a feasibility study for the prototype of a versatile\nmulti-band imaging system for very high-precision differential photometry that\nexploits the choice of specifically selected narrow-band filters and novel\nideas for the execution of simultaneous VIS and NIR measurements. Starting from\nthe fundamental system requirements driven by the science case at hand, we\ndescribe a set of three opto-mechanical solutions for the instrument prototype:\n1) a radial distribution of the optical flux using dichroic filters for the\nwavelength separation and narrow-band filters or liquid crystal filters for the\nobservations; 2) a tree distribution of the optical flux (implying 2 separate\nfoci), with the same technique used for the beam separation and filtering; 3)\nan exotic solution consisting of the study of a complete optical system (i.e. a\nbrand new telescope) that exploits the chromatic errors of a reflecting surface\nfor directing the different wavelengths at different foci.\n", "  Small 3He-rich solar energetic particle (SEP) events have been commonly\nassociated with extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) jets and narrow coronal mass\nejections (CMEs) which are believed to be the signatures of magnetic\nreconnection involving field lines open to interplanetary space. The elemental\nand isotopic fractionation in these events are thought to be caused by\nprocesses confined to the flare sites. In this study we identify 32 3He-rich\nSEP events observed by the Advanced Composition Explorer near the Earth during\nthe solar minimum period 2007-2010 and examine their solar sources with the\nhigh resolution Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) EUV images.\nLeading the Earth, STEREO-A provided for the first time a direct view on\n3He-rich flares, which are generally located on the Sun's western hemisphere.\nSurprisingly, we find that about half of the 3He-rich SEP events in this survey\nare associated with large-scale EUV coronal waves. An examination of the wave\nfront propagation, the source-flare distribution and the coronal magnetic field\nconnections suggests that the EUV waves may affect the injection of 3He-rich\nSEPs into interplanetary space.\n", "  We provide a integration of Navier-Stokes equations concerning the\nunsteady-state laminar flow of an incompressible, isothermal (newtonian) fluid\nin a cylindrical vessel spinning about its symmetry axis, say $z$, and inside\nwhich the liquid velocity starts with a non-zero axial component as well. Basic\nphysical assumptions are that the pressure axial gradient keeps itself on its\nhydrostatic value and that no radial velocity exists. In such a way the PDEs\nbecome uncoupled and can be faced separately from each other. We succeed in\ncomputing both the unsteady velocities, i.e. the axial $v_z$ and the\ncircumferential $v_\\theta$ as well, by means of infinite series expansions of\nFourier-Bessel type under time exponential damping. Following this, we also\nfind the unsteady surfaces of dynamical equilibrium, the wall shear stress and\nthe Stokesian streamlines\n", "  Heavy elements, even though its smaller constituent, are crucial to\nunderstand Jupiter formation history. Interior models are used to determine the\namount of heavy elements in Jupiter interior, nevertheless this range is still\nsubject to degeneracies due to uncertainties in the equations of state. Prior\nto Juno mission data arrival, we present Jupiter optimized calculations\nexploring the effect of different model parameters in the determination of\nJupiter's core and heavy element's mass. We perform comparisons between\nequations of state published recently. The interior model of Jupiter is\ncalculated from the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium, mass and energy\nconservation, and energy transport. The mass of the core and heavy elements is\nadjusted to match Jupiter's observational constrains radius and gravitational\nmoments. We show that the determination of Jupiter interior structure is tied\nto the estimation of its gravitational moments and the accuracy of equations of\nstate of hydrogen, helium and heavy elements. The location of the region where\nHelium rain occurs as well as its timescale are important to determine the\ndistribution of heavy elements and helium in the interior of Jupiter. We show\nthat differences find when modeling Jupiter's interior with recent EOS are more\nlikely due to differences in the internal energy and entropy calculation. The\nconsequent changes in the thermal profile lead to different estimations of the\nmass of the core and heavy elements, explaining differences in recently\npublished Jupiter interior models. Our results help clarify differences find in\nJupiter interior models and will help the interpretation of upcoming Juno data.\n", "  We present a sample of 45 Damped Lyman-$\\alpha$ system (DLA, \\nhi\\ $ \\geq 2\n\\times 10^{20} {\\rm cm}^{-2}$) counterparts (33 detections, 12 upper limits)\nwhich host gamma-ray bursts (GRB-DLAs) in order to investigate star-formation\nand metallicity within galaxies hosting DLAs. Our sample spans $z \\sim 2-6$ and\nis nearly three times larger than any previously detected DLA counterparts\nsurvey based on quasar line-of-sight searches (QSO-DLAs). We report star\nformation rates (SFRs) from rest-frame UV photometry and SED modeling. We find\nthat DLA counterpart SFRs are not correlated with either redshift or HI column\ndensity. Thanks to the combination of \\hst\\ and ground-based observations, we\nalso investigate DLA host star-formation efficiency. Our GRB-DLA counterpart\nsample spans both higher efficiency and low efficiency star formation regions\ncompared to the local Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, local star formation laws,\nand $z \\sim 3$ cosmological simulations. We also compare the depletion times of\nour DLA hosts sample to other objects in the local Universe, our sample appears\nto deviate from the star formation efficiencies measured in local spiral and\ndwarf galaxies. Furthermore, we find similar efficiencies as local inner disks,\nSMC, and LBG outskirts. Finally, our enrichment time measurements show a spread\nof systems with under- and over-abundance of metals which may suggest that\nthese systems had episodic star formation and a metal enrichment/depletion as a\nresult of strong stellar feedback and/or metal inflow/outflow.\n", "  We consider localized soliton-like solutions in the presence of a stable\nscalar condensate background. By the analogy with classical mechanics, it can\nbe shown that there may exist solutions of the nonlinear equations of motion\nthat describe dips or rises in the spatially-uniform charge distribution. We\nalso present explicit analytical solutions for some of such objects and examine\ntheir properties.\n", "  Mean-field galactic dynamo theory is the leading theory to explain the\nprevalence of regular magnetic fields in spiral galaxies, but its systematic\ncomparison with observations is still incomplete and fragmentary. Here we\ncompare predictions of mean-field dynamo models to observational data on\nmagnetic pitch angle and the strength of the mean magnetic field. We\ndemonstrate that a standard $\\alpha^2\\Omega$ dynamo model produces pitch angles\nof the regular magnetic fields of nearby galaxies that are reasonably\nconsistent with available data. The dynamo estimates of the magnetic field\nstrength are generally within a factor of a few of the observational values.\nReasonable agreement between theoretical and observed pitch angles generally\nrequires the turbulent correlation time $\\tau$ to be in the range 10-20 Myr, in\nagreement with standard estimates. Moreover, good agreement also requires that\nthe ratio of the ionized gas scale height to root-mean-square turbulent\nvelocity increases with radius. Our results thus widen the possibilities to\nconstrain interstellar medium (ISM) parameters using observations of magnetic\nfields. This work is a step toward systematic statistical tests of galactic\ndynamo theory. Such studies are becoming more and more feasible as larger\ndatasets are acquired using current and up-and-coming instruments.\n", "  We present an overview of the scientific potential of MATISSE, the Multi\nAperture mid-Infrared SpectroScopic Experiment for the Very Large Telescope\nInterferometer. For this purpose we outline selected case studies from various\nareas, such as star and planet formation, active galactic nuclei, evolved\nstars, extrasolar planets, and solar system minor bodies and discuss strategies\nfor the planning and analysis of future MATISSE observations. Moreover, the\nimportance of MATISSE observations in the context of complementary high-angular\nresolution observations at near-infrared and submillimeter/millimeter\nwavelengths is highlighted.\n", "  We calculate the massive Wilson coefficients for the heavy flavor\ncontributions to the non-singlet charged current deep-inelastic scattering\nstructure functions $F_L^{W^+}(x,Q^2)-F_L^{W^-}(x,Q^2)$ and\n$F_2^{W^+}(x,Q^2)-F_2^{W^-}(x,Q^2)$ in the asymptotic region $Q^2 \\gg m^2$ to\n3-loop order in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at general values of the Mellin\nvariable $N$ and the momentum fraction $x$. Besides the heavy quark pair\nproduction, also the single heavy flavor excitation $s \\rightarrow c$\ncontributes. Numerical results are presented for the charm quark contributions\nand consequences on the unpolarized Bjorken sum rule and Adler sum rule are\ndiscussed.\n", "  Here we present three-dimensional high resolution simulations of Type Ia\nsupernova in the presence of a non-degenerate companion. We find that the\npresence of a nearby companion leaves a long-lived hole in the supernova\nejecta. In particular, we aim to study the long term evolution of this hole as\nthe supernova ejecta interacts with the surrounding interstellar medium. Using\nestimates for the x-ray emission, we find that the hole generated by the\ncompanion remains for many centuries after the interaction between the ejecta\nand the interstellar medium. We also show that the hole is discernible over a\nwide range of viewing angles and companion masses.\n", "  The phase-space description of bosonic quantum systems has numerous\napplications in such fields as quantum optics, trapped ultracold atoms, and\ntransport phenomena. Extension of this description to the case of fermionic\nsystems leads to formal Grassmann phase-space quasiprobability distributions\nand master equations. The latter are usually considered as not possessing\nprobabillistic interpretation and as not directly computationally accessible.\nHere, we describe how to construct $c$-number interpretations of Grassmann\nphase space representations and their master equations. As a specific example,\nthe Grassmann $B$ representation is considered. We disscuss how to introduce\n$c$-number probability distributions on Grassmann algebra and how to integrate\nthem. A measure of size and proximity is defined for Grassmann numbers, and the\nGrassmann derivatives are introduced which are based on infinitesimal\nvariations of function arguments. An example of $c$-number interpretation of\nformal Grassmann equations is presented.\n", "  The Orion A molecular cloud is one of the most well-studied nearby\nstar-forming regions, and includes regions of both highly clustered and more\ndispersed star formation across its full extent. Here, we analyze dense,\nstar-forming cores identified in the 850 {\\mu}m and 450 {\\mu}m SCUBA-2 maps\nfrom the JCMT Gould Belt Legacy Survey. We identify dense cores in a uniform\nmanner across the Orion A cloud and analyze their clustering properties. Using\ntwo independent lines of analysis, we find evidence that clusters of dense\ncores tend to be mass segregated, suggesting that stellar clusters may have\nsome amount of primordial mass segregation already imprinted in them at an\nearly stage. We also demonstrate that the dense core clusters have a tendency\nto be elongated, perhaps indicating a formation mechanism linked to the\nfilamentary structure within molecular clouds.\n", "  We have performed a multi-wavelength analysis of a mid-infrared (MIR) bubble\nN37 and its surrounding environment. The selected 15$' \\times$15$'$ area around\nthe bubble contains two molecular clouds (N37 cloud; V$_{lsr}\\sim$37-43 km\ns$^{-1}$, and C25.29+0.31; V$_{lsr}\\sim$43-48 km s$^{-1}$) along the line of\nsight. A total of seven OB stars are identified towards the bubble N37 using\nphotometric criteria, and two of them are spectroscopically confirmed as O9V\nand B0V stars. Spectro-photometric distances of these two sources confirm their\nphysical association with the bubble. The O9V star is appeared to be the\nprimary ionizing source of the region, which is also in agreement with the\ndesired Lyman continuum flux analysis estimated from the 20 cm data. The\npresence of the expanding HII region is revealed in the N37 cloud which could\nbe responsible for the MIR bubble. Using the $^{13}$CO line data and\nphotometric data, several cold molecular condensations as well as clusters of\nyoung stellar objects (YSOs) are identified in the N37 cloud, revealing ongoing\nstar formation (SF) activities. However, the analysis of ages of YSOs and the\ndynamical age of the HII region do not support the origin of SF due to the\ninfluence of OB stars. The position-velocity analysis of $^{13}$CO data reveals\nthat two molecular clouds are inter-connected by a bridge-like structure,\nfavoring the onset of a cloud-cloud collision process. The SF activities (i.e.\nthe formation of YSOs clusters and OB stars) in the N37 cloud are possibly\ninfluenced by the cloud-cloud collision.\n", "  The HI halo clouds of the Milky Way, and in particular the\nintermediate-velocity clouds (IVCs), are thought to be connected to Galactic\nfountain processes. Observations of fountain clouds are important for\nunderstanding the role of matter recycling and accretion onto the Galactic disk\nand subsequent star formation. Here, we quantify the amount of molecular gas in\nthe Galactic halo. We focus on the rare class of molecular IVCs (MIVCs) and\nsearch for new objects. The HI-FIR correlation was studied across the entire\nnorthern and southern Galactic hemispheres at Galactic latitudes $|b|>20^\\circ$\nto determine the amount and distribution of molecular gas in IVCs. We used the\nmost recent large-scale HI and FIR data, the Effelsberg Bonn-HI Survey, the\nParkes Galactic All-Sky Survey, and the Planck FIR surveys. We present a\ncatalogue of 239 MIVC candidates on the northern and southern Galactic\nhemispheres. Among these candidates, all previously known MIVCs are recovered\nexcept for one single source. The frequency of candidates differs significantly\nbetween the northern and southern Galactic hemispheres and between negative and\npositive LSR velocities as well. In our approach we analyse the local Galactic\nenvironment. Extrapolating our results to the entire Galaxy, the global inflow\nof atomic and molecular IVC gas onto the Milky Way may account for the major\nfraction of the gaseous mass that is required to sustain the current Galactic\nstar formation rate.\n", "  We present the results of a search for HI 21-cm line emission from the\ncircumstellar environments of four Galactic Cepheids (RS Pup, X Cyg, $\\zeta$\nGem, and T Mon) based on observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array.\nThe observations were aimed at detecting gas associated with previous or\nongoing mass loss. Near the long-period Cepheid T Mon, we report the detection\nof a partial shell-like structure whose properties appear consistent with\noriginating from an earlier epoch of Cepheid mass loss. At the distance of T\nMon, the nebula would have a mass (HI+He) of $\\sim0.5M_{\\odot}$, or $\\sim$6\\%\nof the stellar mass. Assuming that one-third of the nebular mass comprises\nswept-up interstellar gas, we estimate an implied mass-loss rate of ${\\dot\n  M}\\sim (0.6-2)\\times10^{-5} M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. No clear signatures of\ncircumstellar emission were found toward $\\zeta$ Gem, RS Pup, or X Cyg,\nalthough in each case, line-of-sight confusion compromised portions of the\nspectral band. For the undetected stars, we derive model-dependent $3\\sigma$\nupper limits on the mass-loss rates, averaged over their lifetimes on the\ninstability strip, of $<(0.3-6)\\times10^{-6} M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and estimate\nthe total amount of mass lost to be less than a few per cent of the stellar\nmass.\n", "  The Z Cam-type dwarf nova AT Cnc displays a classical nova (CN) shell,\ndemonstrating that mass transfer in cataclysmic binaries decreases\nsubstantially after a CN eruption. The hibernation scenario of cataclysmic\nbinaries predicts such a decrease, on a timescale of a few centuries. In order\nto measure the time since AT Cnc's last CN eruption, we have measured the\nradial velocities of a hundred clumps in its ejecta with SITELLE, CFHT's\nrecently commissioned imaging Fourier transform spectrometer. These range from\n-455 to +490 km/s. Coupled with the known distance to AT Cnc of 460 pc (Shara\n2012), the size of AT Cnc's shell, and a simple model of nova ejecta\ndeceleration, we determine that the last CN eruption of this system occurred\n$330_{-90}^{+135}$ years ago. This is the most rapid transition from a high\nmass transfer rate, novalike variable to a low mass transfer rate, dwarf nova\nyet measured, and in accord with the hibernation scenario of cataclysmic\nbinaries. We conclude by noting the similarity in deduced outburst date (within\na century of 1686 CE) of AT Cnc with a \"guest star\" reported in the\nconstellation Cancer by Korean observers in 1645 CE.\n", "  We use the Low Frequency Array to perform a systematic high spectral\nresolution investigation of the low-frequency 33-78 MHz spectrum along the line\nof sight to Cassiopeia A. We complement this with a 304-386 MHz Westerbork\nSynthesis Radio telescope observation. In this first paper we focus on the\ncarbon radio recombination lines.\n  We detect Cn$\\alpha$ lines at -47 and -38 km s$^{-1}$ in absorption for\nquantum numbers n=438-584 and in emission for n=257-278 with high signal to\nnoise. These lines are associated with cold clouds in the Perseus spiral arm\ncomponent. Hn$\\alpha$ lines are detected in emission for n=257-278. In\naddition, we also detect Cn$\\alpha$ lines at 0 km s$^{-1}$ associated with the\nOrion arm.\n  We analyze the optical depth of these transitions and their line width. Our\nmodels show that the carbon line components in the Perseus arm are best fit\nwith an electron temperature 85 K and an electron density 0.04 cm$^{-3}$ and\ncan be constrained to within 15\\%. The electron pressure is constrained to\nwithin 20\\%. We argue that much of these carbon radio recombination lines arise\nin the CO-dark surface layers of molecular clouds where most of the carbon is\nionized but hydrogen has made the transition from atomic to molecular. The\nhydrogen lines are clearly associated with the carbon line emitting clouds, but\nthe low-frequency upperlimits indicate that they likely do not trace the same\ngas. Combining the hydrogen and carbon results we arrive at a firm lower limit\nto the cosmic ray ionization rate of 2.5$\\times$10$^{-18}$ s$^{-1}$, but the\nactual value is likely much larger.\n", "  We present VLA and ALMA imaging of the deeply-embedded protostellar cluster\nNGC6334I from 5 cm to 1.3 mm at angular resolutions as fine as 0.17 (220 AU).\nThe dominant hot core MM1 is resolved into seven components at 1.3 mm,\nclustered within a radius of 1000 AU. Four of the components have brightness\ntemperatures >200 K, radii ~300 AU, minimum luminosities ~10000 Lsun, and must\nbe centrally heated. We term this new phenomenon a \"hot multi-core\". Two of\nthese objects also exhibit compact free-free emission at longer wavelengths,\nconsistent with a hypercompact HII region (MM1B) and a jet (MM1D). The spatial\nkinematics of the water maser emission centered on MM1D are consistent with it\nbeing the origin of the high-velocity bipolar molecular outflow seen in CO. The\nclose proximity of MM1B and MM1D (440~AU) suggests a proto-binary or a\ntransient bound system. Several components of MM1 exhibit steep millimeter SEDs\nindicative of either unusual dust spectral properties or time variability. In\naddition to resolving MM1 and the other hot core (MM2) into multiple\ncomponents, we detect five new millimeter and two new centimeter sources. Water\nmasers are detected for the first time toward MM4A, confirming its membership\nin the protocluster. With a 1.3 mm brightness temperature of 97 K coupled with\na lack of thermal molecular line emission, MM4A appears to be a highly\noptically-thick 240 Lsun dust core, possibly tracing a transient stage of\nmassive protostellar evolution. The nature of the strongest water maser source\nCM2 remains unclear due to its combination of non-thermal radio continuum and\nlack of dust emission.\n", "  Multi-color photometry is presented for a large sample of local ellipticals\nselected by morphology and isolation. The sample uses data from GALEX, SDSS,\n2MASS and Spitzer to cover the filters NUV, ugri, JHK and 3.6mum. Various\ntwo-color diagrams, using the half-light aperture defined in the 2MASS J\nfilter, are very coherent from color to color, meaning that galaxies defined to\nbe red in one color are always red in other colors. Comparison to globular\ncluster colors demonstrates that ellipticals are *not* composed of a single\nage, single metallicity (e.g., [Fe/H]) stellar population, but require a\nmulti-metallicity model using a chemical enrichment scenario. Such a model is\nsufficient to explain two-color diagrams and the color-magnitude relations for\nall colors using only metallicity as a variable on a solely 12 Gyrs stellar\npopulation with no evidence of stars younger than 10 Gyrs. The [Fe/H] values\nthat match galaxy colors range from -0.5 to +0.4, much higher (and older) than\npopulation characteristics deduced from Lick/IDS line-strength system studies,\nindicating an inconsistency between galaxy colors and line indices values for\nreasons unknown. The NUV colors have unusual behavior signaling the rise and\nfall of the UV upturn with elliptical luminosity. Models with BHB tracks can\nreproduce this behavior indicating the UV upturn is strictly a metallicity\neffect.\n", "  HD 179070, aka Kepler-21, is a V = 8.25 F6IV star and the brightest exoplanet\nhost discovered by Kepler. An early detailed analysis by Howell et al. (2012)\nof the first thirteen months (Q0 - Q5) of Kepler light curves revealed transits\nof a planetary companion, Kepler-21b, with a radius of about 1.60 +/- 0.04\nR_earth and an orbital period of about 2.7857 days. However, they could not\ndetermine the mass of the planet from the initial radial velocity observations\nwith Keck-HIRES, and were only able to impose a 2-sigma upper limit of 10\nM_earth. Here we present results from the analysis of 82 new radial velocity\nobservations of this system obtained with HARPS-N, together with the existing\n14 HIRES data points. We detect the Doppler signal of Kepler-21b with a radial\nvelocity semi-amplitude K = 2.00 +/- 0.65 m/s, which corresponds to a planetary\nmass of 5.1 +/- 1.7 M_earth. We also measure an improved radius for the planet\nof 1.639 (+0.019, -0.015) R_earth, in agreement with the radius reported by\nHowell et al. (2012). We conclude that Kepler-21b, with a density of 6.4 +/-\n2.1 g/cm^3, belongs to the population of terrestrial planets with iron,\nmagnesium silicate interiors, which have lost the majority of their envelope\nvolatiles via stellar winds or gravitational escape. The radial velocity\nanalysis presented in this paper serves as example of the type of analysis that\nwill be necessary to confirm the masses of TESS small planet candidates.\n", "  Previous studies have found that the Galactic rotation velocity-metallicity\n(V-[Fe/H]) relations for the thin and thick disk populations show negative and\npositive slopes, respectively. The first Gaia Data Release includes the\nTycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) information, which we use to analyze the\nV-[Fe/H] relation for a strictly selected sample with high enough astrometric\naccuracy. We aim to arrive at an explanation for the slopes of the V-[Fe/H]\nrelationship. We measure the V-[Fe/H] relation for thin and thick disk stars\nclassified on the basis of their [$\\alpha$/Fe] and [Fe/H] abundances. We find\ndV/d[Fe/H]= -18 +/- 2 km/s/dex for stars in the thin disk and dV/d[Fe/H]= +23\n+/- 10 km/s/dex for thick disk stars, so we confirm the different signs for the\nslopes. The negative value of dV/d[Fe/H] for thick disk stars is consistent\nwith previous studies, but the combination of TGAS and APOGEE data provide\nhigher precision, even though systematic errors could exceed +/-5 km/s/dex .\nOur average measurement of dV/d[Fe/H] for local thick disk stars shows a\nsomewhat flatter slope than the previous studies, but we confirm a significant\nspread and a dependence of the slope on the [alpha/Fe] ratio of the stars.\nUsing a simple N-body model, we demonstrate that the observed trend for the\nthick and thin disk can be explained by the observed radial metallicity\ngradients and the correlation between orbital eccentricity and metallicity in\nthe thick disk.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate magnon Kerr effect in a cavity-magnon system,\nwhere magnons in a small yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere are strongly but\ndispersively coupled to the photons in a three-dimensional cavity. When the YIG\nsphere is pumped to generate considerable magnons, the Kerr effect yields a\nperceptible shift of the cavity's central frequency and more appreciable shifts\nof the magnon modes. We derive an analytical relation between the magnon\nfrequency shift and the drive power for the uniformly magnetized YIG sphere and\nfind that it agrees very well with the experimental results of the Kittel mode.\nOur study paves the way to explore nonlinear effects in the cavity-magnon\nsystem.\n", "  We report a Raman scattering study of six rare earth orthoferrites RFeO3,\nwith R = La, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy. The use of extensive polarized Raman\nscattering of SmFeO3 and first-principles calculations enable the assignment of\nthe observed phonon modes to vibrational symmetries and atomic displacements.\nThe assignment of the spectra and their comparison throughout the whole series\nallows correlating the phonon modes with the orthorhombic structural\ndistortions of RFeO3 perovskites. In particular, the positions of two specific\nAg modes scale linearly with the two FeO6 octahedra tilt angles, allowing the\ndistortion throughout the series. At variance with literature, we find that the\ntwo octahedra tilt angles scale differently with the vibration frequencies of\ntheir respective Ag modes. This behavior as well as the general relations\nbetween the tilt angles, the frequencies of the associated modes and the ionic\nradii are rationalized in a simple Landau model. The reported Raman spectra and\nassociated phonon-mode assignment provide reference data for structural\ninvestigations of the whole series of orthoferrites.\n", "  We use bootstrapping to estimate the bias of concentration estimates on\nN-body dark matter halos as a function of particle number. We find that\nalgorithms based on the maximum radial velocity and radial particle binning\ntend to overestimate the concentration by 15%-20% for halos sampled with 200\nparticles and by 7% - 10% for halos sampled with 500 particles. To control this\nbias at low particle numbers we propose a new algorithm that estimates halo\nconcentrations based on the integrated mass profile. The method uses the full\nparticle information without any binning, making it reliable in cases when low\nnumerical resolution becomes a limitation for other methods. This method\nreduces the bias to less than 3% for halos sampled with 200-500 particles. The\nvelocity and density methods have to use halos with at least 4000 particles in\norder to keep the biases down to the same low level. We also show that the\nmass-concentration relationship could be shallower than expected once the\nbiases of the different concentration measurements are taken into account.\nThese results show that bootstrapping and the concentration estimates based on\nthe integrated mass profile are valuable tools to probe the internal structure\nof dark matter halos in numerical simulations.\n", "  We extend a two-component model for the evolution of fluctuations in the\nsolar wind plasma so that it is fully three-dimensional (3D) and also coupled\nself-consistently to the large-scale magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations\ndescribing the background solar wind. The two classes of fluctuations\nconsidered are a high-frequency parallel-propagating wave-like piece and a\nlow-frequency quasi-two-dimensional component. For both components, the\nnonlinear dynamics is dominanted by quasi-perpendicular spectral cascades of\nenergy. Driving of the fluctuations, by, for example, velocity shear and pickup\nions, is included. Numerical solutions to the new model are obtained using the\nCronos framework, and validated against previous simpler models. Comparing\nresults from the new model with spacecraft measurements, we find improved\nagreement relative to earlier models that employ prescribed background solar\nwind fields. Finally, the new results for the wave-like and\nquasi-two-dimensional fluctuations are used to calculate ab initio diffusion\nmean free paths and drift lengthscales for the transport of cosmic rays in the\nturbulent solar wind.\n", "  This work focuses on a sample of seven extremely late-time X-ray flares with\npeak time $t_{\\rm p} > 10^4 {\\rm s}$, among which two flares can be confirmed\nas the late-time activity of central engine. The main purpose is to investigate\nthe mechanism of such late-time flares based on the internal origin assumption.\nIn the hyper-accreting black hole (BH) scenario, we study the possibility of\ntwo well-known mechanisms as the central engine to power such X-ray flares,\ni.e., the neutrino-antineutrino annihilation and the Blandford-Znajek (BZ)\nprocess. Our results show that the annihilation luminosity is far below the\nobservational data. Thus, the annihilation mechanism cannot account for such\nlate-time flares. For the BZ process, if the role of outflows is taken into\nconsideration, the inflow mass rate near the horizon will be quite low such\nthat the magnetic field will probably be too weak to power the observed X-ray\nflares. We therefore argue that, for the late-time flares with internal origin,\nthe central engine is unlikely to be associated with BHs. On the contrary, a\nfast rotating neutron star with strong bipolar magnetic fields may be\nresponsible for such flares.\n", "  Many exoplanets have been found in orbits close to their host stars and thus\nthey are subject to the effects of photo-evaporation. Previous studies have\nshown that a large portion of exoplanets detected by the Kepler mission have\nbeen significantly eroded by photo-evaporation. In this paper, we numerically\nstudy the effects of photo-evaporation on the orbital evolution of a\nhypothesized moon system around a planet. We find that photo-evaporation is\ncrucial to the stability of the moon system. Photo-evaporation can erode the\natmosphere of the planet thus leading to significant mass loss. As the planet\nloses mass, its Hill radius shrinks and its moons increase their orbital\nsemi-major axes and eccentricities. When some moons approach their critical\nsemi-major axes, global instability of the moon system would be triggered,\nwhich usually ends up with two, one or even zero surviving moons. Some lost\nmoons could escape from the moon system to become a new planet orbiting the\nstar or run away further to become a free-floating object in the Galaxy. Given\nthe destructive role of photo-evaporation, we speculate that exo-moons are less\ncommon for close-in planets ($<0.1$ AU), especially those around M-type stars,\nbecause they are more X-ray luminous and thus enhancing photo-evaporation. The\nlessons we learn in this study may be helpful for the target selection of\non-going/future exomoon searching programs.\n", "  A key question in extragalactic studies is the determination of the relative\nroles of stars and AGN in powering dusty galaxies at $z\\sim$1-3 where the bulk\nof star-formation and AGN activity took place. In Paper I, we present a sample\nof $336$ 24$\\mu$m-selected (Ultra)Luminous Infrared Galaxies, (U)LIRGs, at $z\n\\sim 0.3$-$2.8$, where we focus on determining the AGN contribution to the IR\nluminosity. Here, we use hydrodynamic simulations with dust radiative transfer\nof isolated and merging galaxies, to investigate how well the simulations\nreproduce our empirical IR AGN fraction estimates and determine how IR AGN\nfractions relate to the UV-mm AGN fraction. We find that: 1) IR AGN fraction\nestimates based on simulations are in qualitative agreement with the empirical\nvalues when host reprocessing of the AGN light is considered; 2) for\nstar-forming galaxy-AGN composites our empirical methods may be underestimating\nthe role of AGN, as our simulations imply $>$50% AGN fractions, $\\sim$3$\\times$\nhigher than previous estimates; 3) 6% of our empirically classified \"SFG\" have\nAGN fractions $\\gtrsim$50%. While this is a small percentage of SFGs, if\nconfirmed, would imply the true number density of AGN may be underestimated; 4)\nthis comparison depends on the adopted AGN template -- those that neglect the\ncontribution of warm dust lower the empirical fractions by up to 2$\\times$; and\n5) the IR AGN fraction is only a good proxy for the intrinsic UV-mm AGN\nfraction when the extinction is high ($A_V\\gtrsim 1$ or up to and including\ncoalescence in a merger).\n", "  We present improvements to the wavelength calibration for the lenslet-based\nIntegral Field Spectrograph (IFS), that serves as the science instrument for\nthe Gemini Planet Imager (GPI). The GPI IFS features a 2.7\" $\\times$ 2.7\" field\nof view and a 190 $\\times$ 190 lenslet array (14.1 mas/lenslet) with spectral\nresolving power ranging from R $\\sim$ 35 to 78. A unique wavelength solution is\ndetermined for each lenslet characterized by a two-dimensional position, an\nn-dimensional polynomial describing the spectral dispersion, and the rotation\nof the spectrum with respect to the detector axis. We investigate the\nnon-linearity of the spectral dispersion across all Y, J, H, and K bands\nthrough both on-sky arc lamp images and simulated IFS images using a model of\nthe optical path. Additionally, the 10-hole non-redundant masking mode on GPI\nprovides an alternative measure of wavelength dispersion within a datacube by\ncross-correlating reference PSFs with science images. This approach can be used\nto confirm deviations from linear dispersion in the reduced datacubes. We find\nthat the inclusion of a quadratic term provides a factor of 10 improvement in\nwavelength solution accuracy over the linear solution and is necessary to\nachieve uncertainties of a few hundredths of a pixel in J band to a few\nthousands of a pixel in the K bands. This corresponds to a wavelength\nuncertainty of $\\sim$0.2 nm across all filters.\n", "  High-amplitude variability in Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) is usually\nassociated with episodic accretion events. It has not been observed so far in\nmassive YSOs. Here, the high-amplitude variable star sample of\nContrerasPe\\~{n}a et al.(2016) has been used to search for\nhighly-variable($\\Delta$K$\\ge$1\\,mag) sources coinciding with dense clumps\nmapped using the 850\\mum continuum emission by the ATLASGAL survey. 18 variable\nsources are centred on the sub-mm clump peaks, and coincide ($<$1\") with a\n24$\\mu$m point or compact ($<$10\") source. 13 of these 18 sources can be fit by\nYSO models. The 13 variable YSOs(VYSO) have luminosities of $\\sim$10$^3$\nL$_{\\odot}$, an average mass of 8 M$_{\\odot}$ and a range of ages up to 10$^6$\nyr. 11 of these 13 VYSOs are located in the midst of infrared dark clouds. 9 of\nthe 13 sources have $\\Delta$K$>$2 mag, significantly higher compared to the\nmean variability of the entire VVV sample. The light curves of these objects\nsampled between 2010-2015 display rising, declining, or quasi-periodic\nbehaviour but no clear periodicity. Light-curve analysis using Plavchan method\nshow that the most prominent phased signals have periods of a few hundred days.\nThe nature and time-scale of variations found in 6.7 Ghz methanol maser\nemission (MME) in massive stars are similar to that of the VYSO light curves.\nWe argue that the origin of the observed variability is episodic accretion. We\nsuggest that the timescale of a few hundred days may represent the frequency at\nwhich a spiralling disk feeds dense gas to the young massive star.\n", "  A planet orbiting in the \"habitable zone\" of our closest neighboring star,\nProxima Centauri, has recently been discovered, and the next natural question\nis whether or not Proxima b is \"habitable\". Stellar winds are likely a source\nof atmospheric erosion that could be particularly severe in the case of M dwarf\nhabitable zone planets that reside close to their parent star. Here we study\nthe stellar wind conditions that Proxima b experiences over its orbit. We\nconstruct 3-D MHD models of the wind and magnetic field around Proxima Centauri\nusing a surface magnetic field map for a star of the same spectral type and\nscaled to match the observed ~ 600 G surface magnetic field strength of\nProxima. We examine the wind conditions and dynamic pressure over different\nplausible orbits that sample the constrained parameters of the orbit of Proxima\nb. For all the parameter space explored, the planet is subject to stellar wind\npressures of more than 2000 times those experienced by Earth from the solar\nwind. During an orbit, Proxima b is also subject to pressure changes of 1 to 3\norders of magnitude on timescales of a day. Its magnetopause standoff distance\nconsequently undergoes sudden and periodic changes by a factor of 2 to 5.\nProxima b will traverse the interplanetary current sheet twice each orbit, and\nlikely crosses into regions of subsonic wind quite frequently. These effects\nshould be taken into account in any physically realistic assessment or\nprediction of its atmospheric reservoir, characteristics and loss.\n", "  We present multi-epoch X-ray spectral observations of three Type IIn\nsupernovae (SNe) 2005kd, 2006jd, and 2010jl, acquired with Chandra, XMM-Newton,\nSuzaku, and Swift. Previous extensive X-ray studies of SN 2010jl have revealed\nthat X-ray spectra are dominated by thermal emission, which likely arises from\na hot plasma heated by a forward shock propagating into a massive circumstellar\nmedium (CSM). Interestingly, an additional soft X-ray component was required to\nreproduce the spectra at a period of ~1-2 yr after the SN explosion. Although\nthis component is likely associated with the SN, its origin remained an open\nquestion. We find a similar, additional soft X-ray component from the other two\nSNe IIn as well. Given this finding, we present a new interpretation for the\norigin of this component; it is thermal emission from a forward shock\nessentially identical to the hard X-ray component, but directly reaches us from\na void of the dense CSM. Namely, the hard and soft components are responsible\nfor the heavily- and moderately-absorbed components, respectively. The\nco-existence of the two components with distinct absorptions as well as the\ndelayed emergence of the moderately-absorbed X-ray component would be evidence\nfor asphericity of the CSM. We show that the X-ray spectral evolution can be\nqualitatively explained by considering a torus-like geometry for the dense CSM.\nBased on our X-ray spectral analyses, we estimate the radius of the torus-like\nCSM to be on the order of ~5 times 10^{16} cm.\n", "  Infrared variability is common among young stellar objects, with surveys\nfinding daily to weekly fluctuations of a few tenths of a magnitude.\nSpace-based observations can produce highly sampled infrared light curves, but\nare often limited to total baselines of about a month due to the orientation of\nthe spacecraft. Here we present observations of the Chameleon I cluster whose\nlow declination makes it observable by the Spitzer space telescope over a 200\nday period. We observe 30 young stellar objects with a daily cadence to better\nsample variability on timescales of months. We find such variability is common,\noccurring in ~80% of the detected cluster members. The change in [3.6]-[4.5]\ncolor over 200 days for many of the sources falls between that expected for\nextinction and fluctuations in disk emission. With our high cadence and long\nbaseline we can derive power spectral density curves covering two orders of\nmagnitude in frequency and find significant power at low frequencies, up to the\nboundaries of our 200 day survey. Such long timescales are difficult to explain\nwith variations driven by the interaction between the disk and stellar magnetic\nfield, which has a dynamical timescale of days to weeks. The most likely\nexplanation is either structural or temperature fluctuations spread throughout\nthe inner ~0.5 au of the disk, suggesting that the intrinsic dust structure is\nhighly dynamic.\n", "  For appropriate choices of the coupling constants, the equations of motion of\nLovelock gravities up to order n in the Riemann tensor can be factorized such\nthat the theories admits a single (A)dS vacuum. In this paper we construct two\nclasses of exact rotating metrics in such critical Lovelock gravities of order\nn in d=2n+1 dimensions. In one class, the n angular momenta in the n orthogonal\nspatial 2-planes are equal, and hence the metric is of cohomogeneity one. We\nconstruct these metrics in a Kerr-Schild form, but they can then be recast in\nterms of Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. The other class involves metrics with\nonly a single non-vanishing angular momentum. Again we construct them in a\nKerr-Schild form, but in this case it does not seem to be possible to recast\nthem in Boyer-Lindquist form. Both classes of solutions have naked curvature\nsingularities, arising because of the over rotation of the configurations.\n", "  We show that a two-dimensional (2D) spin-polarised Fermi gas immersed in a 3D\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC) constitutes a very promising system to realise a\n$p_x+ip_y$ superfluid. The fermions attract each other via an induced\ninteraction mediated by the bosons, and the resulting pairing is analysed with\nretardation effects fully taken into account. This is further combined with\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) theory to obtain reliable results for the\nsuperfluid critical temperature. We show that both the strength and the range\nof the induced interaction can be tuned experimentally, which can be used to\nmake the critical temperature approach the maximum value allowed by general BKT\ntheory. Moreover, this is achieved while keeping the Fermi-Bose interaction\nweak so that three-body losses are small. Our results show that realising a\ntopological superfluid with atomic Fermi-Bose mixtures is within experimental\nreach.\n", "  In large SEP events, ions can be accelerated at CME-driven shocks to very\nhigh energies. Spectra of heavy ions in many large SEP events show features\nsuch as roll-overs or spectral breaks. In some events when the spectra are\nplotted in energy/nucleon they can be shifted relative to each other to make\nthe spectral breaks align. The amount of shift is charge-to-mass ratio (Q/A)\ndependent and varies from event to event. This can be understood if the spectra\nof heavy ions are organized by the diffusion coefficients (Cohen et al., 2005).\nIn the work of Li et al. (2009), the Q/A dependences of the scaling is related\nto shock geometry when the CME-driven shock is close to the Sun. For events\nwhere multiple in-situ spacecraft observations exist, one may expect that\ndifferent spacecraft are connected to different portions of the CME-driven\nshock that have different shock geometries, therefore yielding different Q/A\ndependence. In this work, we examine one SEP event which occurred on 2013\nNovember 4. We study the Q/A dependence of the energy scaling for heavy ion\nspectra using Helium, oxygen, and iron ions. Observations from STEREO-A,\nSTEREO-B and ACE are examined. We find that the scalings are different for\ndifferent spacecraft. We suggest that this is because ACE, STEREO-A and STEREO-\nB are connected to different parts of the shock that have different shock\ngeometries. Our analysis indicates that studying the Q/A scaling of in-situ\nparticle spectra can serve as a powerful tool to remotely examine the shock\ngeometry for large SEP events.\n", "  We present a systematic search for periodically varying quasars and\nsupermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) candidates in the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1)\nMedium Deep Survey's MD09 field. From a color-selected sample of 670 quasars\nextracted from a multi-band deep-stack catalog of point sources, we locally\nselect variable quasars and look for coherent periods with the Lomb-Scargle\nperiodogram. Three candidates from our sample demonstrate strong variability\nfor more than ~3 cycles, and their PS1 light curves are well fitted to\nsinusoidal functions. We test the persistence of the candidates' apparent\nperiodic variations detected during the 4.2 years of the PS1 survey with\narchival photometric data from the SDSS Stripe 82 survey or new monitoring with\nthe Large Monolithic Imager at the Discovery Channel Telescope. None of the\nthree periodic candidates (including PSO J334.2028+1.4075) remain persistent\nover the extended baseline of 7 - 14 years, corresponding to a detection rate\nof < 1 in 670 quasars in a search area of 5 deg^2. Even though SMBHBs should be\na common product of the hierarchal growth of galaxies, and periodic variability\nin SMBHBs has been theoretically predicted, a systematic search for such\nsignatures in a large optical survey is strongly limited by its temporal\nbaseline and the \"red noise\" associated with normal quasar variability. We show\nthat follow-up long-term monitoring (>5 cycles) is crucial to our search for\nthese systems.\n", "  We present high-resolution (0.16$\"$) 870um Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) imaging of 16 luminous (L_IR ~ 4 x 10^12\nL_sun) submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) from the ALESS survey of the Extended\nChandra Deep Field South. This dust imaging traces the dust-obscured star\nformation in these z~2.5 galaxies on ~1.3 kpc scales. The emission has a median\neffective radius of $R_e=0.24\" \\pm 0.02\"$, corresponding to a typical physical\nsize of $R_{e}=1.8\\pm$0.2 kpc. We derive a median S\\'ersic index of\n$n=0.9\\pm0.2$, implying that the dust emission is remarkably disk-like at the\ncurrent resolution and sensitivity. We use different weighting schemes with the\nvisibilities to search for clumps on 0.12$\"$ (~1.0 kpc) scales, but we find no\nsignificant evidence for clumping in the majority of cases. Indeed, we\ndemonstrate using simulations that the observed morphologies are generally\nconsistent with smooth exponential disks, suggesting that caution should be\nexercised when identifying candidate clumps in even moderate S/N\ninterferometric data. We compare our maps to comparable-resolution HST\nH$_{160}$-band images, finding that the stellar morphologies appear\nsignificantly more extended and disturbed, and suggesting that major mergers\nmay be responsible for driving the formation of the compact dust disks we\nobserve. The stark contrast between the obscured and unobscured morphologies\nmay also have implications for SED fitting routines that assume the dust is\nco-located with the optical/near-IR continuum emission. Finally, we discuss the\npotential of the current bursts of star formation to transform the observed\ngalaxy sizes and light profiles, showing that the $z\\sim0$ descendants of these\nSMGs are expected to have stellar masses, effective radii, and gas surface\ndensities consistent with the most compact massive (M_* ~ 1-2 x 10^11 M_sun)\nearly-type galaxies observed locally.\n", "  We derive metallicities for 41 cataclysmic variables (CVs) from near-infrared\nspectroscopy. We use synthetic spectra that cover the 0.8 $\\mu$m $\\leq \\lambda\n\\leq$ 2.5 $\\mu$m bandpass to ascertain the value of [Fe/H] for CVs with K-type\ndonors, while also deriving abundances for other elements. Using calibrations\nfor determining [Fe/H] from the $K$-band spectra of M-dwarfs, we derive more\nprecise values for T$_{\\rm eff}$ for the secondaries in the shortest period\nCVs, and examine whether they have carbon deficits. In general, the donor stars\nin CVs have sub-solar metallicities. We confirm carbon deficits for a large\nnumber of systems. CVs with orbital periods $>$ 5 hr are most likely to have\nunusual abundances. We identify four CVs with CO emission. We use\nphase-resolved spectra to ascertain the mass and radius of the donor in U Gem.\nThe secondary star in U Gem appears to have a lower {\\it apparent} gravity than\na main sequence star of its spectral type. Applying this result to other CVs,\nwe find that the later-than-expected spectral types observed for many CV donors\nis mostly an affect of inclination. All of the magnetic CVs, except the low\naccretion rate polar MQ Dra, have donors with subsolar metallicities. We find\nthat two systems with unusual spectra, EI Psc and QZ Ser, that have large\nexcesses of sodium, and extreme deficits of carbon. Synthetic spectra that have\na reduced abundance of hydrogen are best able to explain the spectra of these\ntwo objects.\n", "  We examine the pair entanglement in the ground state of finite dimerized\nspin-$s$ chains interacting through anisotropic $XY$ couplings immersed in a\ntransverse magnetic field, by means of a self-consistent pair mean field\napproximation. The approach, which makes no a priori assumptions on the pair\nstates, predicts, for sufficiently low coupling between pairs, $2s$ distinct\ndimerized phases for increasing fields below the pair factorizing field,\nseparated by spin parity breaking phases. The dimerized phases lead to\napproximate magnetization and pair entanglement plateaus, while the parity\nbreaking phases are characterized by weak pair entanglement but non-negligible\nentanglement of the pair with the rest of the system. These predictions are\nconfirmed by the exact results obtained in finite $s=1$ and $s=3/2$ chains. It\nis also shown that for increasing values of the spin $s$, the entanglement of\nan isolated pair, as measured by the negativity, rapidly saturates in the\nanisotropic $XY$ case but increases as $s^{1/2}$ in the $XX$ case, reflecting a\ndistinct single spin entanglement spectrum.\n", "  We present Herschel observations of far-infrared (FIR) fine-structure (FS)\nlines [CII]158$\\mu$m, [OI]63$\\mu$m, [OIII]52$\\mu$m, and [SiII]35$\\mu$m in the\nz=2.56 Cloverleaf quasar, and combine them with published data in an analysis\nof the dense interstellar medium (ISM) in this system. Observed [CII]158$\\mu$m,\n[OI]63$\\mu$m, and FIR continuum flux ratios are reproduced with\nphotodissociation region (PDR) models characterized by moderate far-ultraviolet\n(FUV) radiation fields $G_0=$ 0.3-1$\\times10^3$ and atomic gas densities\n$n_{\\rm H}=$ 3-5$\\times10^3$ cm$^{-3}$, depending on contributions to\n[CII]158$\\mu$m from ionized gas. We assess the contribution to [CII]158$\\mu$m\nflux from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) narrow line region (NLR) using\nground-based measurements of the [NII]122$\\mu$m transition, finding that the\nNLR can contribute at most 20-30% of the observed [CII]158$\\mu$m flux. The PDR\ndensity and far-UV radiation fields inferred from the atomic lines are not\nconsistent with the CO emission, indicating that the molecular gas excitation\nis not solely provided via UV-heating from local star-formation, but requires\nan additional heating source. X-ray heating from the AGN is explored, and we\nfind that X-ray dominated region (XDR) models, in combination with PDR models,\ncan match the CO cooling without overproducing observed FS line emission. While\nthis XDR/PDR solution is favored given the evidence for both X-rays and\nstar-formation in the Cloverleaf, we also investigate alternatives for the warm\nmolecular gas, finding that either mechanical heating via low-velocity shocks\nor an enhanced cosmic-ray ionization rate may also contribute. Finally, we\ninclude upper limits on two other measurements attempted in the Herschel\nprogram: [CII]158$\\mu$m in FSC~10214 and [OI]63$\\mu$m in APM~08279+5255.\n", "  The Galactic center has some of the highest stellar densities in the Galaxy\nand a range of interstellar scattering properties that may aid in the detection\nof new radio-selected transient events. Here we describe a search for radio\ntransients in the Galactic center using over 200 hours of archival data from\nthe Very Large Array (VLA) at 5 and 8.4 GHz. Every observation of SgrA* from\n1985$-$2005 has been searched using an automated processing and detection\npipeline sensitive to transients with timescales between 30 seconds and five\nminutes with a typical detection threshold of $\\sim$100 mJy. Eight possible\ncandidates pass tests to filter false-positives from radio-frequency\ninterference, calibration errors, and imaging artifacts. Two events are\nidentified as promising candidates based on the smoothness of their light\ncurves. Despite the high quality of their light curves, these detections remain\nsuspect due to evidence of incomplete subtraction of the complex structure in\nthe Galactic center, and apparent contingency of one detection on reduction\nroutines. Events of this intensity ($\\sim$100 mJy) and duration ($\\sim$100 s)\nare not obviously associated with known astrophysical sources, and no\ncounterparts are found in data at other wavelengths. We consider potential\nsources, including Galactic center pulsars, dwarf stars, sources like GCRT\nJ1745-3009, and bursts from X-ray binaries. None can fully explain the observed\ntransients, suggesting either a new astrophysical source or a subtle imaging\nartifact. More sensitive multiwavelength studies are necessary to characterize\nthese events which, if real, occur with a rate of $14^{+32}_{-12}~{\\rm\nhr}^{-1}\\,{\\rm deg}^{-2}$ in the Galactic center.\n", "  We propose a physical model for the peaked noise in the X-ray power density\nspectra of accreting X-ray binaries. We interpret its appearance as an\ninterference of two Comptonization continua: one coming from the up-scattering\nof seed photons from the cold thin disk and the other fed by the synchrotron\nemission of the hot flow. Variations of both X-ray components are caused by\nfluctuations in mass accretion rate, but there is a delay between them\ncorresponding to the propagation timescale from the disk Comptonization radius\nto the region of synchrotron Comptonization. If the disk and synchrotron\nComptonization are correlated, the humps in the power spectra are harmonically\nrelated and the dips between them appear at frequencies related as odd numbers\n1:3:5. If they are anti-correlated, the humps are related as 1:3:5, but the\ndips are harmonically related. Similar structures are expected to be observed\nin accreting neutron star binaries and supermassive black holes. The delay can\nbe easily recovered from the frequency of peaked noise and further used to\nconstrain the combination of the viscosity parameter and disk height-to-radius\nratio $\\alpha (H/R)^2$ of the accretion flow. We model multi-peak power spectra\nof black hole X-ray binaries GX 339$-$4 and XTE J1748$-$288 to constrain these\nparameters.\n", "  We present new HI spectral line images of the nearby low-mass galaxy NGC\n5238, acquired with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). Located at a\ndistance of 4.51+/-0.04 Mpc, NGC 5238 is an actively star-forming galaxy with\nwidespread H-alpha and UV continuum emission. The source is included in many\nongoing and recent nearby galaxy surveys, but until this work the spatially\nresolved qualities of its neutral interstellar medium have remained unstudied.\nOur HI images resolve the disk on physical scales of ~400 pc, allowing us to\nundertake a detailed comparative study of the gaseous and stellar components.\nThe HI disk is asymmetric in the outer regions, and the areas of high HI mass\nsurface density display a crescent-shaped morphology that is slightly offset\nfrom the center of the stellar populations. The HI column density exceeds 10^21\ncm^-2 in much of the disk. We quantify the degree of co-spatiality of dense HI\ngas and sites of ongoing star formation as traced by far-UV and H-alpha\nemission. The neutral gas kinematics are complex; using a spatially-resolved\nposition-velocity analysis, we infer a rotational velocity of 31+/-5 km/s. We\nplace NGC 5238 on the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation and contextualize the\nsystem amongst other low-mass galaxies.\n", "  We present deep Very Large Array imaging of 3C~273 in order to determine the\ndiffuse, large scale radio structure of this famous radio-loud quasar. Diffuse\nextended structure (radio lobes) is detected for the first time in these\nobservations as a consequence of high dynamic range in the 327.5 and 1365 MHz\nimages. This emission is used to estimate a time averaged jet power, $7.2\n\\times 10^{43} \\rm{~ergs~s^{-1}} < \\overline{Q} < 3.7 \\times 10^{44}\n\\rm{~ergs~s^{-1}}$. Brightness temperature arguments indicate consistent values\nof the time variability Doppler factor and the compactness Doppler factor for\nthe inner jet, $\\delta \\gtrsim 10$. Thus, the large apparent broadband\nbolometric luminosity of the jet, $\\sim 3 \\times 10^{46}\\rm{~ergs~s^{-1}}$,\ncorresponds to a modest intrinsic luminosity $\\gtrsim\n10^{42}\\rm{~ergs~s^{-1}}$, or $\\sim 1\\%$ of $\\overline{Q}$. In summary, we find\nthat 3C~273 is actually a \"typical\" radio loud quasar contrary to suggestions\nin the literature. The modest $\\overline{Q}$ is near the peak of the luminosity\ndistribution for radio loud quasars and it is consistent with the current rate\nof dissipation emitted from millimeter wavelengths to gamma rays. The extreme\ncore-jet morphology is an illusion from a near pole-on line of sight to a\nhighly relativistic jet that produces a Doppler enhanced glow that previously\nswamped the lobe emission. 3C~273 apparently has the intrinsic kpc scale\nmorphology of a classical double radio source, but it is distorted by an\nextreme Doppler aberration.\n", "  The Candidate Cluster and Protocluster Catalog (CCPC) is a list of objects at\nredshifts z > 2 composed of galaxies with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts\nthat are coincident on the sky and in redshift. These protoclusters are\nidentified by searching for groups in volumes corresponding to the expected\nsize of the most massive protoclusters at these redshifts. In CCPC1 we\nidentified 43 candidate protoclusters among 14,000 galaxies between 2.74 < z <\n3.71. Here we expand our search to more than 40,000 galaxies with spectroscopic\nredshifts z > 2.00, resulting in an additional 173 candidate structures. The\nmost significant of these are 36 protoclusters with overdensities {\\delta} > 7.\nWe also identify three large proto-supercluster candidates containing multiple\nprotoclusters at z = 2.3, 3.5 and z = 6.56. Eight candidates with N > 10 or\nmore galaxies are found at redshifts z > 4.0. The last system in the catalog is\nthe most distant spectroscopic protocluster candidate known to date at z =\n6.56.\n", "  We present ALMA CO(1-0) and CO(3-2) observations of the brightest cluster\ngalaxy (BCG) in the 2A 0335+096 galaxy cluster (z = 0.0346). The total\nmolecular gas mass of (1.13+/-0.15) x 10^9 M_sun is divided into two\ncomponents: a nuclear region and a 7 kpc long dusty filament. The central\nmolecular gas component accounts for (3.2+/-0.4) x 10^8 M_sun of the total\nsupply of cold gas. Instead of forming a rotationally-supported ring or disk,\nit is composed of two distinct, blueshifted clumps south of the nucleus and a\nseries of low-significance redshifted clumps extending toward a nearby\ncompanion galaxy. The velocity of the redshifted clouds increases with radius\nto a value consistent with the companion galaxy, suggesting that an interaction\nbetween these galaxies <20 Myr ago disrupted a pre-existing molecular gas\nreservoir within the BCG. Most of the molecular gas, (7.8+/-0.9) x 10^8 M_sun,\nis located in the filament. The CO emission is co-spatial with a 10^4 K\nemission-line nebula and soft X-rays from 0.5 keV gas, indicating that the\nmolecular gas has cooled out of the intracluster medium over a period of 25-100\nMyr. The filament trails an X-ray cavity, suggesting that the gas has cooled\nfrom low entropy gas that has been lifted out of the cluster core and become\nthermally unstable. We are unable to distinguish between inflow and outflow\nalong the filament with the present data. Cloud velocities along the filament\nare consistent with gravitational free-fall near the plane of the sky, although\ntheir increasing blueshifts with radius are consistent with outflow.\n", "  Using the high-precision photometry from the Kepler space telescope,\nthousands of stars with stellar and planetary companions have been observed.\nThe characterization of stars with companions is not always straightforward and\ncan be contaminated by systematic and stellar influences on the light curves.\nHere, through a detailed analysis of starspots and eclipses, we identify\nKOI-1003 as a new, active RS CVn star---the first identified with data from\nKepler. The Kepler light curve of this close binary system exhibits the\nsystem's primary transit, secondary eclipse, and starspot evolution of two\npersistent active longitudes. The near equality of the system's orbital and\nrotation periods indicates the orbit and primary star's rotation are nearly\nsynchronized ($P_\\mathrm{orb} = 8.360613\\pm0.000003$ days; $P_\\mathrm{rot} \\sim\n8.23$ days). By assuming the secondary star is on the main sequence, we suggest\nthe system consists of a $1.45^{+0.11}_{-0.19} \\ M_\\odot$ subgiant primary and\na $0.59^{+0.03}_{-0.04} \\ M_\\odot$ main-sequence companion. Our work gives a\ndistance of $4400 \\pm 600$ pc and an age of $t = 3.0^{-0.5}_{+2.0}$ Gyr,\nparameters which are discrepant with previous studies that included the star as\na member of the open cluster NGC 6791.\n", "  We report the discovery of infalling motion with rotation of S235AB the\nmassive cluster-forming clump (~10^3 Mo) in the S235 region. Our C18O\nobservations with the 45m telescope at the Nobeyama Radio Observatory have\nrevealed the elliptical shape of the clump. Position-velocity (PV) diagram\ntaken along its major axis exhibits two well-defined peaks symmetrically\nlocated with respect to the clump center, which is similar to that found for a\ndynamically infalling envelope with rotation around a single protostar modeled\nby N. Ohashi and his collaborators, indicating that the cluster-forming clump\nis also collapsing by the self-gravity toward the clump center. With analogue\nto Ohashi's model, we made a simple model of an infalling, rotating clump to\nfit the observed data. Based on the inferred model parameters as well as\nresults of earlier observations and simulations in the literature, we discuss\nstructures of the clump such as the relation among the global mass infall rate\n(~10^-3 Mo/yr), formation of a compact core (with a mass and size of ~4 Mo and\n< 0.1 pc) at the center, and a massive star (~11 Mo) forming in the core.\n", "  We have conducted 22 GHz 1\" JVLA imaging of 70 radio-quiet AGN from the\nSwift-BAT survey. We find radio cores in all but three objects. The radio\nmorphologies of the sample fall into three groups: compact and core-dominated,\nextended, and jet-like. We spatially decompose each image into core flux and\nextended flux, and compare the extended radio emission to that predicted from\nprevious Herschel observations using the canonical FIR-radio relation. After\nremoving the AGN contribution to the FIR and radio flux densities, we find that\nthe relation holds remarkably well despite the potentially different star\nformation physics in the circumnuclear environment. We also compare our core\nradio flux densities with predictions of coronal models and scale-invariant jet\nmodels for the origin of radio emission in radio-quiet AGN, and find general\nconsistency with both models. However, we find that the $L_{\\mathrm{R}} /\nL_{\\mathrm{X}}$ relation does not distinguish between star formation and\nnon-relativistic AGN-driven outflows as the origin of radio emission in\nradio-quiet AGN. Finally, we examine where objects with different radio\nmorphologies fall in relation to the main sequence of star formation, and\nconclude that those AGN that fall below the main sequence, as X-ray selected\nAGN have been found to do, have core-dominated or jet-like 22 GHz morphologies.\n", "  We present transmission spectroscopy of the warm Saturn-mass exoplanet\nWASP-39b made with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) FOcal Reducer and\nSpectrograph (FORS2) across the wavelength range 411-810nm. The transit depth\nis measured with a typical precision of 240 parts per million (ppm) in\nwavelength bins of 10nm on a V = 12.1 magnitude star. We detect the sodium\nabsorption feature (3.2-sigma) and find evidence for potassium. The\nground-based transmission spectrum is consistent with Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) optical spectroscopy, strengthening the interpretation of WASP-39b having\na largely clear atmosphere. Our results demonstrate the great potential of the\nrecently upgraded FORS2 spectrograph for optical transmission spectroscopy,\nobtaining HST-quality light curves from the ground.\n", "  Although surveys of infall motions in dense cores have been carried out for\nyears, few surveys have focused on mapping infall across cores using multiple\nspectral line observations. To fill this gap, we present IRAM 30-m Telescope\nmaps of N2H+(1-0), DCO+(2-1), DCO+(3-2), and HCO+(3-2) emission towards two\nprestellar cores (L492 and L694-2) and one protostellar core (L1521F). We find\nthat the measured infall velocity varies with position across each core and\nchoice of molecular line, likely as a result of radial variations in core\nchemistry and dynamics. Line-of-sight infall speeds estimated from DCO+(2-1)\nline profiles can decrease by 40-50 m/s when observing at a radial offset >=\n0.04 pc from the core's dust continuum emission peak. Median infall speeds\ncalculated from all observed positions across a core can also vary by as much\nas 65 m/s depending on the transition. These results show that while\nsingle-pointing, single-transition surveys of core infall velocities may be\ngood indicators of whether a core is either contracting or expanding, the\nmagnitude of the velocities they measure are significantly impacted by the\nchoice of molecular line, proximity to the core center, and core evolutionary\nstate.\n", "  We use holographic techniques to compute inflationary non-Gaussianities for\ngeneral single-field inflation, including models with a non-trivial sound\nspeed. In this holographic approach, the inflationary dynamics is captured by a\nrelevant deformation of the dual conformal field theory (CFT) in the UV, while\nthe inflationary correlators are computed by conformal perturbation theory. In\nthis paper, we discuss the effects of higher derivative operators, such as\n$(\\partial_\\mu\\phi\\partial^\\mu\\phi)^{m}$, which are known to induce a\nnon-trivial sound speed and source potentially large non-Gaussianities. We\ncompute the full inflationary bispectra from the deformed CFT correlators. We\nalso discuss the squeezed limit of the bispectra from the viewpoint of operator\nproduct expansions. As is generic in the holographic description of inflation,\nour power spectrum is blue tilted in the UV region. We extend our bispectrum\ncomputation to the IR region by resumming the conformal perturbations to all\norders. We provide a self-consistent setup which reproduces a red tilted power\nspectrum, as well as all possible bispectrum shapes in the slow-roll regime.\n", "  We study the global gravitational stability of a gaseous self-gravitating\nMaclaurin disk in the absence of a halo. Further, we replace Newtonian gravity\nwith the specific Modified gravity theory known as MOG in the relevant\nliterature. MOG is an alternative theory for addressing the dark matter problem\nwithout invoking exotic dark matter particles, and possesses two free\nparameters $\\alpha$ and $\\mu_0$ in the weak field limit. We derive the\nequilibrium gravitational potential of the Maclaurin disk in MOG and develop a\nsemi-analytic method for studying the response of the disk to linear\nnon-axysymmetric perturbations. The eigenvalue spectrum of the normal modes of\nthe disk is obtained and its physical meaning has been explored. We show that\nMaclaurin disks are less stable in MOG than in Newtonian gravity. In fact both\nparameters $(\\alpha,\\mu_0)$ have destabilizing effects on the disk.\nInterestingly $\\mu_0$ excites only the bar mode $m=2$ while $\\alpha$ affects\nall the modes. More specifically, when $\\alpha>1$, the bar mode is strongly\nunstable and unlike in Newtonian gravity can not be avoided, at least in the\nweak field limit, with increasing the pressure support of the disk.\n", "  We study a particular Galileon inflation in the light of Planck2015\nobservational data in order to constraint the model parameter space. We study\nthe spectrum of the primordial modes of the density perturbations by expanding\nthe action up to the second order in perturbations. Then we pursue by expanding\nthe action up to the third order and find the three point correlation functions\nto find the amplitude of the non-Gaussianity of the primordial perturbations in\nthis setup. We study the amplitude of the non-Gaussianity both in equilateral\nand orthogonal configurations and test the model with recent observational\ndata. Our analysis shows that for some ranges of the non-minimal coupling\nparameter, the model is consistent with observation and it is also possible to\nhave large non-Gaussianity which would be observable by future improvements in\nexperiments. Moreover, we obtain the tilt of the tensor power spectrum and test\nthe standard inflationary consistency relation ($r=-8n_T$) against the latest\nbounds from the Planck2015 dataset. We find a slight deviation from the\nstandard consistency relation in this setup. Nevertheless, such a deviation\nseems not to be sufficiently remarkable to be detected confidently.\n", "  A set of exclusive decays of the Higgs boson into a vector meson and a\ndilepton pair ($h\\to V \\ell^+ \\ell^-$, with $V=\\Upsilon, J/\\psi,\\phi$, and\n$\\ell=\\mu, \\tau$) are studied in the framework of the Standard Model. We have\nevaluated the decay rates, the dilepton mass spectra and the $V$ longitudinal\nhelicity fraction distributions. In the same framework, we considered the\nexclusive modes $h\\to V \\nu \\bar \\nu$ and the implications of the CMS and ATLAS\nresults for the lepton flavor-changing process $h\\to \\tau^+ \\mu^-$ on the $h\\to\nV \\tau^+ \\mu^-$ decay modes.\n", "  The magnetic field plays a major role in governing the dynamics of the sun.\nMany interesting features like sunspots, flares, prominences, and Coronal Mass\nEjections (CMEs) occur on its surface due to the dynamics associated with the\nmagnetic fields. The magnetic activity exhibits spatial scales ranging from\nvery fine scale (below the resolution limit of the current largest telescope)\nto large scale such as sunspots, active regions and the spatial scales as large\nas the sun itself. While the major efforts in building large telescopes is\ngoing on towards the goal of resolving smallest structure possible we propose\nhere to measure the magnetic field on the global scale. For this purpose we\npropose an instrument to carryout high precision and high accurate\nspectropolarimetry of sun-as-a-star. In this thesis, we explore various\ninstrumental design aspects that are necessary to make such observations. As\npart of the design consideration we have analysed a major noise source i.e.\nseeing induced cross-talk through simulation as well as using the measured\nscintillation data. Further, we have analysed full disk Stokes images from\nSOLIS/VSM and SDO/HMI for the purpose of getting a rough idea on the disk\naveraged Stokes signal level. The instrument design aspects are mainly\nconstrained by the need to modulate the light before it enters the telescope\nand image the full sun as a point source. Modulating the light before it enters\nthe telescope has the advantage of completely avoiding the instrumental\npolarization which will enable us to carry out high accurate polarimetric\nmeasurements. We have explored in this thesis various concepts of polarization\nmodulator and spectral discriminator and worked out their suitability for the\npurpose of carrying out high precision and high accurate spectropolarimetry of\nsun-as-a-star at high spectral resolution.\n", "  Recent studies have derived quasar luminosity functions (QLFs) at various\nredshifts. However, the faint side of the QLF at high redshifts is still too\nuncertain. An accurate estimate of the survey completeness is essential to\nderive an accurate QLF for use in studying the luminosity-dependent density\nevolution of the quasar population. Here we investigate how the luminosity\ndependence of quasar spectra (the Baldwin effect) and the attenuation model for\nthe inter-galactic medium (IGM) affect the completeness estimates. For this\npurpose, we revisit the completeness of quasar surveys specifically at\n$z\\sim4-5$, using the COSMOS images observed with Subaru/Suprime-Cam. As the\nresult, we find that the completeness estimates are sensitive to the luminosity\ndependence of the quasar spectrum and difference in the IGM attenuation models.\nAt $z\\sim4$, the number density of quasars when we adopt the latest IGM model\nand take the luminosity dependence of spectra into account are\n$(3.49\\pm1.62)\\times10^{-7}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ mag$^{-1}$ for $-24.09<M_{1450}<-23.09$\nand $(5.24\\pm2.13)\\times10^{-7}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ mag$^{-1}$ for\n$-23.09<M_{1450}<-22.09$, respectively, which are $\\sim$$24$$\\%$ lower than\nthat estimated by the conventional method. On the other hand, at $z\\sim5$, a\n$1\\sigma$ confidence upper limit of the number density at\n$-24.5<M_{1450}<-22.5$ in our new estimates is $\\sim$$43$$\\%$ higher than that\nestimated previously. The results suggest that the luminosity dependence of the\nquasar spectrum and the IGM model are important for deriving accurate number\ndensity of high-$z$ quasars. Even taking these effects into account, the\ninferred luminosity-dependent density evolution of quasars is consistent with\nthe AGN down-sizing evolutionary picture.\n", "  We introduce a growing network model---the copying model---in which a new\nnode attaches to a randomly selected target node and, in addition,\nindependently to each of the neighbors of the target with copying probability\n$p$. When $p<\\frac{1}{2}$, this algorithm generates sparse networks, in which\nthe average node degree is finite. A power-law degree distribution also arises,\nwith a non-universal exponent whose value is determined by a transcendental\nequation in $p$. In the sparse regime, the network is \"normal\", e.g., the\nrelative fluctuations in the number of links are asymptotically negligible. For\n$p\\geq \\frac{1}{2}$, the emergent networks are dense (the average degree\nincreases with the number of nodes $N$) and they exhibit intriguing structural\nbehaviors. In particular, the $N$-dependence of the number of $m$-cliques\n(complete subgraphs of $m$ nodes) undergoes $m-1$ transitions from normal to\nprogressively more anomalous behavior at a $m$-dependent critical values of\n$p$. Different realizations of the network, which start from the same initial\nstate, exhibit macroscopic fluctuations in the thermodynamic limit---absence of\nself averaging. When linking to second neighbors of the target node can occur,\nthe number of links asymptotically grows as $N^2$ as $N\\to\\infty$, so that the\nnetwork is effectively complete as $N\\to \\infty$.\n", "  The TW Hya Association (TWA) is a nearby stellar association with an age of\n$\\sim$ 5-10 Myr. This is an important age for studying the late stages of star\nand planet formation. We measure the parallaxes of 14 candidate members of TWA.\nThat brings to 38 the total number of individual stars with fully measured\nkinematics, i.e. proper motion, radial velocity, and parallax, to describe\ntheir motions through the Galaxy. We analyze these kinematics to search for\nconvergence to a smaller volume in the past, but we find the association is\nnever much more compact than it is at present. We show that it is difficult to\nmeasure traceback ages for associations such as TWA that have expected velocity\ndispersions of 1-2 km s$^{-1}$ with typical measurement uncertainties. We also\nuse our stellar distances and pre-main-sequence evolutionary tracks to find the\naverage age of the association of 7.9 $\\pm$ 1.0 Myr. Additionally, our parallax\nmeasurement of TWA 32 indicates it should be considered a bona fide member of\nTWA. Two new candidate members have high membership probabilities, and we\nassign them TWA numbers: TWA 45 for 2MASS J11592786-4510192 and TWA 46 for\n2MASS J12354615-4115531.\n", "  Previous works have suggested a correlation between the X-ray luminosity Lx\nand the rotational luminosity Lrot of the radio pulsars.However, none of the\nobtained regression lines are statistically acceptable due to large scatters.\n  We construct a statistical model which has an intrinsic Lx-Lrot relation and\nreproduces the observed Lx distribution about it by using a Monte Carlo\nsimulator, which takes into account the effects obscuring the intrinsic\nrelation,i.e., the anisotropy of radiation, additional heating, uncertainty in\ndistance and detection limit of the instruments.\n  From the ATNF pulsar catalog we collect 57 `ordinary radio pulsars' with\nsignificant detection and 42 with upper limits.The sample does not include the\nhigh-magnetic field pulsars (>10^{13} G), which are separately analyzed.\n  We obtain a statistically acceptable relation Lx (0.5 - 10 keV)= 10^{31.69}\n(Lrot / L_0)^{c_1} with c_1 = 1.03 \\pm 0.27 and L_0 =10^{35.38}. The\ndistribution about the obtained Lx-Lrot relation is reproduced well by the\nsimulator.\n  Pulsars with abnormally high Lx fall into two types: one is the soft\ngamma-ray pulsars, and the other is thermally bright pulsars in comparison with\nthe standard cooling curve. On the other hand, pulsars showing low Lx are found\nto have dim pulsar wind nebulae. We argue that there is an unknown mechanism\nthat governs both the magnetospheric emission and the pulsar wind nebulae, and\nit might involve the production rate of electron-positron pairs.\n  The high-field pulsars form a distinctive population other than the ordinary\npulsars due to their excess luminosities.\n", "  We introduce a new stacking method in Keplerian disks that (1) enhances\nsignal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of detected molecular lines and (2) that makes\nvisible otherwise undetectable weak lines. Our technique takes advantage of the\nKeplerian rotational velocity pattern. It aligns spectra according to their\ndifferent centroid velocities at their different positions in a disk and stacks\nthem. After aligning, the signals are accumulated in a narrower velocity range\nas compared to the original line width without alignment. Moreover, originally\ncorrelated noise becomes de-correlated. Stacked and aligned spectra, thus, have\na higher S/N. We apply our method to ALMA archival data of DCN (3-2), DCO+\n(3-2), N2D+ (3-2), and H2CO (3_0,3-2_0,2), (3_2,2-2_2,1), and (3_2,1-2_2,0) in\nthe protoplanetary disk around HD 163296. As a result, (1) the S/N of the\noriginally detected DCN (3-2), DCO+ (3-2), and H2CO (3_0,3-2_0,2) and N2D+\n(3-2) lines are boosted by a factor of >4-5 at their spectral peaks, implying\none order of magnitude shorter integration times to reach the original S/N; and\n(2) the previously undetectable spectra of the H2CO (3_2,2-2_2,1) and\n(3_2,1-2_2,0) lines are materialized at more than 3 sigma. These dramatically\nenhanced S/N allow us to measure intensity distributions in all lines with high\nsignificance. The principle of our method can not only be applied to Keplerian\ndisks but also to any systems with ordered kinematic patterns.\n", "  We have performed, for the first time, the successful automated detection of\nCoronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) in data from the inner heliospheric imager (HI-1)\ncameras on the STEREO A spacecraft. Detection of CMEs is done in time-height\nmaps based on the application of the Hough transform, using a modified version\nof the CACTus software package, conventionally applied to coronagraph data. In\nthis paper we describe the method of detection. We present the result of the\napplication of the technique to a few CMEs that are well detected in the HI-1\nimagery, and compare these results with those based on manual cataloging\nmethodologies. We discuss in detail the advantages and disadvantages of this\nmethod.\n", "  In order to study the effect of the anti de Sitter/ conformal field theory\ncorrespondence (AdS/CFT) on the primordial inflationary era, we consider a\nuniverse filled with a tachyon field in a slow-roll regime. In this context,\nthe background and perturbative parameters characterising the inflationary era\nare related to the standard one by correction terms. We show a clear agreement\nbetween the theoretical prediction and the observational data for the above\nmentioned model. The main results of our work are illustrated for an\nexponential potential. We show that, for a suitable conformal anomaly\ncoefficient, AdS/CFT correspondence might leave its imprints on the spectrum of\nthe gravitational waves amplitude with a tensor to scalar ratio, $r$, of the\nperturbations compatible with Planck data.\n", "  We present interferometric observations of the sigma Orionis triple system\nusing the CHARA Array, NPOI, and VLTI. Using these measurements, we spatially\nresolve the orbit of the close spectroscopic binary (Aa,Ab) for the first time\nand present a revised orbit for the wide pair (A,B). Combining the visual\norbits with previously published radial velocity measurements and new radial\nvelocities measured at CTIO, we derive dynamical masses for the three massive\nstars in the system of M_Aa = 16.99 +/- 0.20 Msun, M_Ab = 12.81 +/- 0.18 Msun,\nand M_B = 11.5 +/- 1.2 Msun. The inner and outer orbits in the triple are not\ncoplanar, with a relative inclination of 120-127 deg. The orbital parallax\nprovides a precise distance of 387.5 +/- 1.3 pc to the system. This is a\nsignificant improvement over previous estimates of the distance to the young\nsigma Orionis cluster.\n", "  We use extensive gravity-sensitive DDO 51 photometry over 5100 square\ndegrees, combined with SDSS broadband photometry, to select a catalog of $\\sim\n4,000$ giant stars covering a large fraction of the high Galactic latitude sky\nand reaching out to $\\sim 80$ kpc in the Galactic halo. This sample of bright\nand unbiased tracers enables us to measure the radial profile and 3D structure\nof the stellar halo to large distance which had previously only been measured\nwith sparse tracers or small samples. Using population synthesis models to\nreproduce the observed giant star luminosity function, we find that the halo\nmaintains a $r^{-3.5}$ profile from $30$ to $80$ kpc with no signs of a\ntruncation or sharp break over this range. The radial profile measurement is\nlargely insensitive to individual halo substructure components, but we find\nthat attempting to measure the shape of the halo is overwhelmed by the\nSagittarius stream such that no ellipsoidal shape is a satisfactory description\nin this region. These measurements allow us to begin placing the Milky Way in\ncontext with the growing sample of external galaxies where similar halo profile\nmeasurements are available, with the goal of further linking the properties of\nstellar halos to the accretion histories that formed them.\n", "  We have searched the L1340 A, B, and C clouds for shocks from protostellar\noutflows using the H$_2$ 2.122 $\\mu$m near-IR line as a shock tracer.\nSubstantial outflow activity has been found in each of the three regions of the\ncloud (L1340 A, L1340 B, & L1340 C). We find 42 distinct shock complexes (16 in\nL1340 A, 11 in L1340 B, and 15 in L1340 C). We were able to link 17 of those\nshock complexes in to 12 distinct outflows and identify candidate source stars\nfor each. We examine the properties (A$_{V}$, T$_{bol}$, and L$_{bol}$) of the\nsource protostars and compare that to the properties of the general population\nof Class 0/I and flat SED protostars and find that there is an indication,\nalbeit at low statistical significance, that the outflow driving protostars are\ndrawn from a population with lower A$_{V}$, higher L$_{bol}$, and lower\nT$_{bol}$ than the general population of protostars.\n", "  To simulate the energy balance of coronal plasmas on macroscopic scales, we\noften require the specification of the coronal heating mechanism in some\nfunctional form. To go beyond empirical formulations and to build a more\nphysically motivated heating function, we investigate the\nwave-turbulence-driven (WTD) phenomenology for the heating of closed coronal\nloops. Our implementation is designed to capture the large-scale propagation,\nreflection, and dissipation of wave turbulence along a loop. The parameter\nspace of this model is explored by solving the coupled WTD and hydrodynamic\nevolution in 1D for an idealized loop. The relevance to a range of solar\nconditions is also established by computing solutions for over one hundred\nloops extracted from a realistic 3D coronal field. Due to the implicit\ndependence of the WTD heating model on loop geometry and plasma properties\nalong the loop and at the footpoints, we find that this model can significantly\nreduce the number of free parameters when compared to traditional empirical\nheating models, and still robustly describe a broad range of quiet-sun and\nactive region conditions. The importance of the self-reflection term in\nproducing relatively short heating scale heights and thermal nonequilibrium\ncycles is also discussed.\n", "  We examine ultraviolet halos around a sample of highly inclined galaxies\nwithin 25 Mpc to measure their morphology and luminosity. Despite contamination\nfrom galactic light scattered into the wings of the point-spread function, we\nfind that UV halos occur around each galaxy in our sample. Around most galaxies\nthe halos form a thick, diffuse disk-like structure, but starburst galaxies\nwith galactic superwinds have qualitatively different halos that are more\nextensive and have filamentary structure. The spatial coincidence of the UV\nhalos above star-forming regions, the lack of consistent association with\noutflows or extraplanar ionized gas, and the strong correlation between the\nhalo and galaxy UV luminosity suggest that the UV light is an extragalactic\nreflection nebula. UV halos may thus represent 1-10 million solar masses of\ndust within 2-10 kpc of the disk, whose properties may change with height in\nstarburst galaxies.\n", "  We study the properties of kinematically disturbed galaxies in the SAMI\nGalaxy Survey using a quantitative criterion, based on kinemetry (Krajnovic et\nal.). The approach, similar to the application of kinemetry by Shapiro et al.\nuses ionised gas kinematics, probed by H{\\alpha} emission. By this method\n23+/-7% of our 360-galaxy sub-sample of the SAMI Galaxy Survey are\nkinematically asymmetric. Visual classifications agree with our kinemetric\nresults for 90% of asymmetric and 95% of normal galaxies. We find stellar mass\nand kinematic asymmetry are inversely correlated and that kinematic asymmetry\nis both more frequent and stronger in low-mass galaxies. This builds on\nprevious studies that found high fractions of kinematic asymmetry in low mass\ngalaxies using a variety of different methods. Concentration of star forma-\ntion and kinematic disturbance are found to be correlated, confirming results\nfound in previous work. This effect is stronger for high mass galaxies (log(M*)\n> 10) and indicates that kinematic disturbance is linked to centrally\nconcentrated star formation. Comparison of the inner (within 0.5Re) and outer\nH{\\alpha} equivalent widths of asymmetric and normal galaxies shows a small but\nsignificant increase in inner equivalent width for asymmetric galaxies.\n", "  It has been known that some solar activity indicators show a double-peak\nfeature in their evolution through a solar cycle, which is not conspicuous in\nsunspot number. In this letter, we investigate the high solar dynamic activity\nin the declining phase of the sunspot cycle by examining the evolution of polar\nand low latitude coronal hole areas and the statistics of splitting and merging\nevents of coronal holes and coronal mass ejections detected by SOHO/LASCO C3 in\nsolar cycle 23. Although the total coronal hole area is at its maximum near the\nsunspot minimum, in which polar coronal holes prevail, it shows a comparable\nsecond maximum in the declining phase of the cycle, in which low latitude\ncoronal holes are dominant. The events of coronal hole splitting or merging,\nwhich are attributed to surface motions of magnetic fluxes, are also mostly\npopulated in the declining phase of the cycle. The far-reaching C3 coronal mass\nejections are also over-populated in the declining phase of the cycle. From\nthese results we suggest that solar dynamic activities due to the horizontal\nmotions of magnetic fluxes extend far in the declining phase of the sunspot\ncycle.\n", "  We present a binary evolution study of cataclysmic variables (CVs) and\nrelated systems with white dwarf accretors, including for example, AM CVn\nsystems, classical novae, supersoft X-ray sources, and systems with giant donor\nstars. Our approach intentionally avoids the complications associated with\npopulation synthesis algorithms thereby allowing us to present the first truly\ncomprehensive exploration of all of the subsequent binary evolution pathways\nthat ZACVs might follow (assuming fully non-conservative, Roche-lobe overflow\nonto an accreting WD) using the sophisticated binary stellar evolution code\nMESA. The grid consists of 56,000 initial models, including 14 white dwarf\naccretor masses, 43 donor-star masses ($0.1-4.7$ $M_{\\odot}$), and 100 orbital\nperiods. We explore evolution tracks in the orbital period and donor-mass\n($P_{\\rm orb}-M_{\\rm don}$) plane in terms of evolution dwell times, masses of\nthe white dwarf accretor, accretion rate, and chemical composition of the\ncenter and surface of the donor star. We report on the differences among the\nstandard CV tracks, those with giant donor stars, and ultrashort period\nsystems. We show where in parameter space one can expect to find supersoft\nX-ray sources, present a diagnostic to distinguish among different evolutionary\npaths to forming AM CVn binaries, quantify how the minimum orbital period in\nCVs depends on the chemical composition of the donor star, and update the\n$P_{\\rm orb}(M_{\\rm wd})$ relation for binaries containing white dwarfs whose\nprogenitors lost their envelopes via stable Roche-lobe overflow. Finally, we\nindicate where in the $P_{\\rm orb}-M_{\\rm don}$ the accretion disks will tend\nto be stable against the thermal-viscous instability, and where gravitational\nradiation signatures may be found with LISA.\n", "  We constrain the rate of gas inflow into and outflow from a main-sequence\nstar-forming galaxy at z~1.4 by fitting a simple analytic model for the\nchemical evolution in a galaxy to the observational data of the stellar mass,\nmetallicity, and molecular gas mass fraction. The molecular gas mass is derived\nfrom CO observations with a metallicity-dependent CO-to-H2 conversion factor,\nand the gas metallicity is derived from the H{\\alpha} and [NII]{\\lambda} 6584\nemission line ratio. Using a stacking analysis of CO integrated intensity maps\nand the emission lines of H{\\alpha} and [NII], the relation between stellar\nmass, metallicity, and gas mass fraction is derived. We constrain the inflow\nand outflow rates with least-chi-square fitting of a simple analytic chemical\nevolution model to the observational data. The best-fit inflow and outflow\nrates are ~1.7 and ~0.4 in units of star-formation rate, respectively. The\ninflow rate is roughly comparable to the sum of the star-formation rate and\noutflow rate, which supports the equilibrium model for galaxy evolution; i.e.,\nall inflow gas is consumed by star formation and outflow.\n", "  It remains challenging to detect the low surface brightness structures of\nfaint high-z galaxies, which is key to understanding the structural evolution\nof galaxies. The technique of image stacking allows us to measure the averaged\nlight profile beneath the detection limit and probe the extended structure of a\ngroup of galaxies. We carry out simulations to examine the recovery of the\naveraged surface brightness profile through stacking model HST/ACS images of a\nset of galaxies as functions of Sersic index (n), effective radius (Re) and\naxis ratio (AR). The Sersic profile best fitting the radial profile of the\nstacked image is taken as the recovered profile, in comparison with the\nintrinsic mean profile of the model galaxies. Our results show that, in\ngeneral, the structural parameters of the mean profile can be properly\ndetermined through stacking, although systematic biases need to be corrected\nwhen spreads of Re and AR are counted. We find that Sersic index is slightly\noverestimated and Re is underestimated at AR < 0.5 as the stacked image appears\nto be more compact due to the presence of inclined galaxies; the spread of Re\nbiases the stacked profile to have a higher Sersic index. We stress that the\nmeasurements of structural parameters through stacking should take these biases\ninto account. We estimate the biases in the recovered structural parameters\nfrom stacks of galaxies when the samples have distributions of Re, AR and n\nseen in local galaxies.\n", "  We present the first resolved observations of the 1.3mm polarized emission\nfrom the disk-like structure surrounding the high-mass protostar Cepheus A HW2.\nThese CARMA data partially resolve the dust polarization, suggesting an uniform\nmorphology of polarization vectors with an average position angle of 57 degrees\nand an average polarization fraction of 2.0%. The distribution of the\npolarization vectors can be attributed to (1) the direct emission of\nmagnetically aligned grains of dust by a uniform magnetic field, or (2) the\npattern produced by the scattering of an inclined disk. We show that both\nmodels can explain the observations, and perhaps a combination of the two\nmechanisms produce the polarized emission. A third model including a toroidal\nmagnetic field does not match the observations. Assuming scattering is the\npolarization mechanism, these observations suggest that during the first few\n10000 years of high-mass star formation, grain sizes can grow from 1 to several\n10s micron.\n", "  Inspired by the recent Kepler discoveries of circumbinary planets orbiting\nnine close binary stars, we explore the fate of the former as the latter evolve\noff the main sequence. We combine binary star evolution models with dynamical\nsimulations to study the orbital evolution of these planets as their hosts\nundergo common-envelope stages, losing in the process a tremendous amount of\nmass on dynamical timescales. Five of the systems experience at least one\nRoche-lobe overflow and common-envelope stages (Kepler-1647 experiences three),\nand the binary stars either shrink to very short orbits or coalesce; two\nsystems trigger a double-degenerate supernova explosion. Kepler's circumbinary\nplanets predominantly remain gravitationally bound at the end of the\ncommon-envelope phase, migrate to larger orbits, and may gain significant\neccentricity; their orbital expansion can be more than an order of magnitude\nand can occur over the course of a single planetary orbit. The orbits these\nplanets can reach are qualitatively consistent with those of the currently\nknown post-common-envelope, eclipse-time variations circumbinary candidates.\nOur results also show that circumbinary planets can experience both modes of\norbital expansion (adiabatic and non-adiabatic) if their host binaries undergo\nmore than one common-envelope stage; multiplanet circumbinary systems like\nKepler-47 can experience both modes during the same common-envelope stage.\nAdditionally, unlike Mercury orbiting the Sun, a circumbinary planet with the\nsame semi-major axis can survive the common envelope evolution of a close\nbinary star with a total mass of 1 MSun.\n", "  We present resolved HI and CO observations of three galaxies from the\nHIghMass sample, a sample of HI-massive ($M_{HI} > 10^{10} M_\\odot$), gas-rich\n($M_{HI}$ in top $5\\%$ for their $M_*$) galaxies identified in the ALFALFA\nsurvey. Despite their high gas fractions, these are not low surface brightness\ngalaxies, and have typical specific star formation rates (SFR$/M_*$) for their\nstellar masses. The three galaxies have normal star formation rates for their\nHI masses, but unusually short star formation efficiency scale lengths,\nindicating that the star formation bottleneck in these galaxies is in the\nconversion of HI to H$_2$, not in converting H$_2$ to stars. In addition, their\ndark matter spin parameters ($\\lambda$) are above average, but not\nexceptionally high, suggesting that their star formation has been suppressed\nover cosmic time but are now becoming active, in agreement with prior H$\\alpha$\nobservations.\n", "  We present Gemini/GNIRS spectroscopy of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 4388, with\nsimultaneous coverage from 0.85 - 2.5 $\\mu$m. Several spatially-extended\nemission lines are detected for the first time, both in the obscured and\nunobscured portion of the optical narrow line region (NLR), allowing us to\nassess the combined effects of the central continuum source, outflowing gas and\nshocks generated by the radio jet on the central 280 pc gas. The HI and [FeII]\nlines allow us to map the extinction affecting the NLR. We found that the\nnuclear region is heavily obscured, with E(B-V) ~1.9 mag. To the NE of the\nnucleus and up to ~150 pc, the extinction remains large, ~1 mag or larger,\nconsistent with the system of dust lanes seen in optical imaging. We derived\nposition-velocity diagrams for the most prominent lines as well as for the\nstellar component. Only the molecular gas and the stellar component display a\nwell-organized pattern consistent with disk rotation. Other emission lines are\nkinematically perturbed or show little evidence of rotation. Extended\nhigh-ionization emission of sulfur, silicon and calcium is observed to\ndistances of at least 200 pc both NE and SW of the nucleus. We compared flux\nratios between these lines with photoionization models and conclude that\nradiation from the central source alone cannot explain the observed\nhigh-ionization spectrum. Shocks between the radio-jet and the ambient gas are\nvery likely an additional source of excitation. We conclude that NGC 4388 is a\nprime laboratory to study the interplay between all these mechanisms.\n", "  A gauge invariant UV-completion for singlet fermion DM interacting with the\nstandard model (SM) particles involves a new singlet scalar. Therefore the\nmodel contains two scalar mediators, mixtures of the SM Higgs boson and a\nsinglet scalar boson. Collider phenomenology of the interference effect between\nthese two scalar propagators is studied in this work. This interference effect\ncan be either constructive or destructive in the DM production cross section\ndepending on both singlet scalar and DM masses, and it will soften the final\nstate jets in the full mass region. Applying the CMS mono-jet search to our\nmodel, we find the interference effect plays a very important role in the DM\nsearch sensitivity, and the DM production cross section of our model is more\nthan one order of magnitude below the LHC sensitivity at current stage.\n", "  It is still a mystery why only a small fraction of active galactic nuclei\n(AGNs) contain relativistic jets. Strong magnetic field is a necessary\ningredient for jet formation, however, the advection of the external field in a\ngeometrically thin disk is inefficient. The gas with a small angular velocity\nmay fall from the Bondi radius $R_{\\rm B}$ nearly freely to the circularization\nradius $R_{\\rm c}$, and a thin accretion disk is formed within $R_{\\rm c}$. We\nsuggest that the external magnetic field is substantially enhanced in this\nregion, and the magnetic field at $R_{\\rm c}$ can be sufficiently strong to\ndrive outflows from the disk if the angular velocity of the gas is low at\n$R_{\\rm B}$. The magnetic field is efficiently dragged in the disk, because\nmost angular momentum of the disk is removed by the outflows that leads to a\nsignificantly high radial velocity. The strong magnetic field formed in this\nway may accelerate jets in the region near the black hole either by the\nBlandford-Payne or/and Blandford-Znajek mechanisms. We suggest that the radio\ndichotomy of AGNs predominantly originates from the angular velocity of the\ncircumnuclear gas. An AGN will appear as a radio-loud (RL) one if the angular\nvelocity of the circumnuclear gas is lower than a critical value at the Bondi\nradius, otherwise, it will appear as a radio-quiet (RQ) AGN. This is supported\nby the observations that RL nuclei are invariably hosted by core galaxies. Our\nmodel suggests that the mass growth of the black holes in RL quasars is much\nfaster than that in RQ quasars with the same luminosity, which is consistent\nwith the fact that the massive black holes in RL quasars are systematically a\nfew times heavier than those in their RQ counterparts.\n", "  We continue our study of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 11 AGN\nat 1.5 < z < 2.2, with optical-NIR spectra, X-ray data and mid-IR photometry.\nIn a previous paper we presented the observations and models; in this paper we\nexplore the parameter space of these models. We first quantify uncertainties on\nthe black hole masses (M$_{\\rm BH}$) and degeneracies between SED parameters.\nThe effect of BH spin is tested, and we find that while low to moderate spin\nvalues (a$_*$ $\\leq$ 0.9) are compatible with the data in all cases, maximal\nspin (a$_*$ = 0.998) can only describe the data if the accretion disc is\nface-on. The outer accretion disc radii are well constrained in 8/11 objects,\nand are found to be a factor ~5 smaller than the self-gravity radii. We then\nextend our modelling campaign into the mid-IR regime with WISE photometry,\nadding components for the host galaxy and dusty torus. Our estimates of the\nhost galaxy luminosities are consistent with the M$_{\\rm BH}$-bulge\nrelationship, and the measured torus properties (covering factor and\ntemperatures) are in agreement with earlier work, suggesting a predominantly\nsilicate-based grain composition. Finally, we deconvolve the optical-NIR\nspectra using our SED continuum model. We claim that this is a more physically\nmotivated approach than using empirical descriptions of the continuum such as\nbroken power-laws. For our small sample, we verify previously noted\ncorrelations between emission linewidths and luminosities commonly used for\nsingle-epoch M$_{\\rm BH}$ estimates, and observe a statistically significant\nanti-correlation between [O III] equivalent width and AGN luminosity.\n", "  Blazars are highly variable active galactic nuclei which emit radiation at\nall wavelengths from radio to gamma-rays. Polarized radiation from blazars is\none key piece of evidence for synchrotron radiation at low energies and it also\nvaries dramatically. The polarization of blazars is of interest for\nunderstanding the origin, confinement, and propagation of jets. However, even\nthough numerous measurements have been performed, the mechanisms behind jet\ncreation, composition and variability are still debated. We performed\nsimultaneous gamma-ray and optical photopolarimetry observations of 45 blazars\nbetween Jul. 2008 and Dec. 2014 to investigate the mechanisms of variability\nand search for a basic relation between the several subclasses of blazars. We\nidentify a correlation between the maximum degree of optical linear\npolarization and the gamma-ray luminosity or the ratio of gamma-ray to optical\nfluxes. Since the maximum polarization degree depends on the condition of the\nmagnetic field (chaotic or ordered), this result implies a systematic\ndifference in the intrinsic alignment of magnetic fields in pc-scale\nrelativistic jets between different types blazars (FSRQs vs. BL Lacs), and\nconsequently between different types of radio galaxies (FR Is vs. FR IIs).\n", "  The frequency dependence of the longitudinal group speeds of trapped sausage\nwaves plays an important role in determining impulsively generated wave trains,\nwhich have often been invoked to account for quasi-periodic signals in coronal\nloops. We examine how the group speeds ($v_{\\rm gr}$) depend on angular\nfrequency ($\\omega$) for sausage modes in pressureless coronal tubes with\ncontinuous transverse density distributions by solving the dispersion relation\npertinent to the case where the density inhomogeneity of arbitrary form takes\nplace in a transition layer of arbitrary thickness. We find that in addition to\nthe transverse lengthscale $l$ and density contrast $\\rho_{\\rm i}/\\rho_{\\rm\ne}$, the group speed behavior depends also on the detailed form of the density\ninhomogeneity. For parabolic profiles, $v_{\\rm gr}$ always decreases with\n$\\omega$ first before increasing again, as happens for the much studied top-hat\nprofiles. For linear profiles, however, the behavior of the $\\omega-v_{\\rm gr}$\ncurves is more complex. When $\\rho_{\\rm i}/\\rho_{\\rm e} \\lesssim 6$, the curves\nbecome monotonical for large values of $l$. On the other hand, for higher\ndensity contrasts, a local maximum $v_{\\rm gr}^{\\rm max}$ exists in addition to\na local minimum $v_{\\rm gr}^{\\rm min}$ when coronal tubes are diffuse. With\ntime-dependent computations, we show that the different behavior of group speed\ncurves, the characteristic speeds $v_{\\rm gr}^{\\rm min}$ and $v_{\\rm gr}^{\\rm\nmax}$ in particular, is reflected in the temporal evolution and Morlet spectra\nof impulsively generated wave trains. We conclude that the observed\nquasi-periodic wave trains not only can be employed to probe such key\nparameters as density contrasts and profile steepness, but also have the\npotential to discriminate between the unknown forms of the transverse density\ndistribution.\n", "  On 2011 September 6, we observed an X2.1-class flare in continuum and\nH$\\alpha$ with a frame rate of about 30~Hz. After processing images of the\nevent by using a speckle-masking image reconstruction, we identified\nwhite-light (WL) flare ribbons on opposite sides of the magnetic neutral line.\nWe derive the lightcurve decay times of the WL flare kernels at each resolution\nelement by assuming that the kernels consist of one or two components that\ndecay exponentially, starting from the peak time. As a result, 42% of the\npixels have two decay-time components with average decay times of 15.6 and 587\ns, whereas the average decay time is 254 s for WL kernels with only one\ndecay-time component. The peak intensities of the shorter decay-time component\nexhibit good spatial correlation with the WL intensity, whereas the peak\nintensities of the long decay-time components tend to be larger in the early\nphase of the flare at the inner part of the flare ribbons, close to the\nmagnetic neutral line. The average intensity of the longer decay-time\ncomponents is 1.78 times higher than that of the shorter decay-time components.\nIf the shorter decay time is determined by either the chromospheric cooling\ntime or the nonthermal ionization timescale and the longer decay time is\nattributed to the coronal cooling time, this result suggests that WL sources\nfrom both regions appear in 42% of the WL kernels and that WL emission of the\ncoronal origin is sometimes stronger than that of chromospheric origin.\n", "  The study aims at a derivation of generalized \\RH relations, especially that\nfor the entropy, for the case of different upstream/downstream polytropic\nindices and their implications. We discuss the solar/stellar wind interaction\nwith the interstellar medium for different polytropic indices and concentrate\non the case when the polytropic index changes across hydrodynamical shocks. We\nuse first a numerical mono-fluid approach with constant polytropic index in the\nentire integration region to show the influence of the polytropic index on the\nthickness of the helio-/astrosheath and on the compression ratio. Second, the\nRankine-Hugonoit relations for a polytropic index changing across a shock are\nderived analytically, particularly including a new form of the entropy\ncondition. In application to the/an helio-/astrosphere, we find that the size\nof the helio-/astrosheath as function of the polytropic index decreases in a\nmono-fluid model for indices less than $\\gamma=5/3$ and increases for higher\nones and vice versa for the compression ratio. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nchanging polytropic indices across a shock are physically allowed only for\nsufficiently high Mach numbers and that in the hypersonic limit the compression\nratio depends only on the downstream polytropic index, while the ratios of the\ntemperature and pressure as well as the entropy difference depend on both, the\nupstream and downstream polytropic indices.\n", "  The hyperluminous X-ray source (HLX-1, the peak X-ray luminosity $\\sim\n10^{42}\\rm erg\\ s^{-1}$) near the spiral galaxy ESO 243-49 is possibly the best\ncandidate for intermediate mass black hole (IMBH), which underwent recurrent\noutbursts with a period of $\\sim 400$ days. The physical reason for this\nquasi-periodic variability is still unclear. We explore the possibility of\nradiation-pressure instability in accretion disk by modeling the light curve of\nHLX-1, and find that it can roughly reproduce the duration, period and\namplitude of the recurrent outbursts HLX-1 with an IMBH of ~10^5Msun. Our\nresult provides a possible mechanism to explain the recurrent outbursts in\nHLX-1. We further find a universal correlation between the outburst duration\nand the bolometric luminosity for the BH sources with a very broad mass range\n(e.g., X-ray binaries, XRBs, HLX-1 and active galactic nuclei, AGNs), which is\nroughly consistent with the prediction of radiation-pressure instability of the\naccretion disk. These results imply that \"heartbeat\" oscillations triggered by\nradiation-pressure instability may appears in different-scale BH systems.\n", "  We develop a novel approach to enable the full-wave simulation of stimulated\nBrillouin scattering and related phenomena in a frequency-domain,\nfinite-element environment. The method uses transformation optics techniques to\nimplement a time-harmonic coordinate transform that reconciles the different\nframes of reference used by electromagnetic and mechanical finite-element\nsolvers. We show how this strategy can be successfully applied to bulk and\nguided systems, comparing the results with the predictions of established\ntheory.\n", "  We present the Chandra and Suzaku observations of 1RXS J170047.8$-$314442,\nlocated towards the Galactic bulge, to reveal a wide-band ($0.3$-$10$ keV)\nX-ray morphology and spectrum of this source. With the Chandra observation, no\npoint source was found at the position of 1RXS J170047.8$-$314442.\nAlternatively, we revealed the presence of diffuse X-ray emission by the\nwide-band X-ray image obtained from the Suzaku XIS. Although the X-ray emission\nhad a nearly circular shape with a spatial extent of $\\sim 3.5'$, the surface\nbrightness profile was not axisymmetric; a bright spot-like emission was found\nat $\\sim 1'$ away in the north-western direction from the center. The radial\nprofile of the surface brightness, except for this spot-like emission, was\nreproduced with a single $\\beta$-model; $\\beta$ and the core radius were found\nto be $1.02$ and $1.51'$, respectively. The X-ray spectrum of the diffuse\nemission showed an emission line at $\\sim 6$ keV, indicating an origin of a\nthermal plasma. The spectrum was well explained with an absorbed optically-thin\nthermal plasma model with a temperature of $6.2$ keV and a redshift parameter\nof $z = 0.14 \\pm 0.01$. Hence, the X-ray emission was considered to arise from\nthe hot gas associated with a cluster of galaxies. Our spectroscopic result\nconfirmed the optical identification of 1RXS J170047.8$-$314442 by Kocevski et\nal. (2007): CIZA J1700.8$-$3144, a member of the cluster catalogue in the Zone\nof Avoidance. The estimated bolometric X-ray luminosity of $5.9 \\times 10^{44}$\nerg s$^{-1}$ was among the lowest with this temperature, suggesting that this\ncluster is far from relaxed.\n", "  Energy losses from isolated neutron stars are commonly attributed to the\nemission of electromagnetic radiation from a rotating point-like magnetic\ndipole in vacuum. This emission mechanism predicts a braking index $n=3$, which\nis not observed in highly magnetized neutron stars. Despite this fact, the\nassumptions of a dipole field and rapid early rotation are often assumed a\npriori, typically causing a discrepancy between the characteristic age and the\nassociated supernova remnant (SNR) age. We focus on neutron stars with\n`anomalous' magnetic fields that have established SNR associations and known\nages. Anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) and soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) are\nusually described in terms of the magnetar model, which posits a large magnetic\nfield established by dynamo action. The high magnetic field pulsars (HBPs) have\nextremely large magnetic fields just above QED scale (but below that of the\nAXPs and SGRs), and central compact objects (CCOs) may have buried fields that\nwill emerge in the future as nascent magnetars. In the first part of this\nseries we examined magnetic field growth as a method of uniting the CCOs with\nHBPs and X-ray dim isolated neutron stars (XDINSs) through evolution. In this\nwork we constrain the characteristic age of these neutron stars using the\nrelated SNR age for a variety of energy loss mechanisms and allowing for\narbitrary initial spin periods. In addition to the SNR age, we also make use of\nthe observed braking indices and X-ray luminosities to constrain the models.\n", "  We describe a scenario to explain blazar periodicities with timescales of\n$\\sim$ few years. The scenario is based on a binary super-massive black hole\n(SMBH) system in which one of the two SMBH carries a jet. We discuss the\nvarious mechanisms that can cause the jet to precess and produce corkscrew\npatterns through space with a scale of $\\sim$ few pc. It turns out that the\ndominant mechanism responsible for the precession is simply the imprint of the\njet-carrying SMBH orbital speed on the jet. Gravitational deflection and\nLense-Thirring precession (due to the gravitational field of the other SMBH)\nare second order effects.\n  We complement the scenario with a kinematical jet model which is inspired to\nthe spine-sheath structure observed in M87. One of the main advantages of such\na structure is that it allows the peak of the synchrotron emission to scale\nwith frequency according to $\\nu F\\propto \\nu^{\\xi}$ as the viewing angle is\nchanged, where $\\xi$ is not necessarily 3 or 4 as in the case of jets with\nuniform velocity, but can be $\\xi \\sim 1$.\n  Finally, we apply the model to the source PG1553+113, which has been recently\nclaimed to show a $T_{\\rm obs}=(2.18\\pm 0.08)\\text{ yr}$ periodicity. We are\nable to reproduce the optical and gamma-ray light curves and multiple\nsynchrotron spectra simultaneously. We also give estimates of the source mass\nand size.\n", "  We investigate the impact of turbulent suppression of parallel heat\nconduction on the cooling of post-flare coronal loops. Depending on the value\nof the mean free path $\\lambda_T$ associated with the turbulent scattering\nprocess, we identify four main cooling scenarios. The overall temperature\nevolution, from an initial temperature in excess of $10^7$~K, is modeled in\neach case, highlighting the evolution of the dominant cooling mechanism\nthroughout the cooling process. Comparison with observed cooling times allows\nthe value of $\\lambda_T$ to be constrained, and interestingly this range\ncorresponds to situations where collision-dominated conduction plays a very\nlimited role, or even no role at all, in the cooling of post-flare coronal\nloops.\n", "  We analyze thermodynamic bounds on equilibrium fluctuations of an order\nparameter, which are analogous to relations, which have been derived recently\nin the context of non-equilibrium fluctuations of currents. We discuss the case\nof {\\it global} fluctuations when the order parameter is measured in the full\nsystem of interest, and {\\it local} fluctuations, when the order parameter is\nevaluated only in a sub-part of the system. Using isometric fluctuation\ntheorems, we derive thermodynamic bounds on the fluctuations of the order\nparameter in both cases. These bounds could be used to infer the value of\nsymmetry breaking field or the relative size of the observed sub-system to the\nfull system from {\\it local} fluctuations.\n", "  The trans-Neptunian region of the solar system exhibits an intricate\ndynamical structure, much of which can be explained by an instability-driven\norbital history of the giant planets. However, the origins of a highly\ninclined, and in certain cases retrograde, population of trans-Neptunian\nobjects remain elusive within the framework of this evolutionary picture. In\nthis work, we show that the existence of a distant, Neptune-like planet that\nresides on an eccentric and mildly inclined orbit fully accounts for the\nanomalous component the trans-Neptunian orbital distribution. Adopting the same\nparameters for Planet Nine as those previously invoked to explain the\nclustering of distant Kuiper belt orbits in physical space, we carry out a\nseries of numerical experiments which elucidate the physical process though\nwhich highly inclined Kuiper belt objects with semi-major axes smaller than 100\nAU are generated. The identified dynamical pathway demonstrates that enigmatic\nmembers of the Kuiper belt such as Drac and Niku are derived from the extended\nscattered disk of the solar system.\n", "  We investigate properties of the ion-scale spectral break of solar wind\nturbulence by means of two-dimensional high-resolution hybrid particle-in-cell\nsimulations. We impose an initial ambient magnetic field perpendicular to the\nsimulation box and add a spectrum of in-plane, large-scale, magnetic and\nkinetic fluctuations. We perform a set of simulations with different values of\nthe plasma beta, distributed over three orders of magnitude, from 0.01 to 10.\nIn all the cases, once turbulence is fully developed, we observe a power-law\nspectrum of the fluctuating magnetic field on large scales (in the inertial\nrange) with a spectral index close to -5/3, while in the sub-ion range we\nobserve another power-law spectrum with a spectral index systematically varying\nwith $\\beta$ (from around -3.6 for small values to around -2.9 for large ones).\nThe two ranges are separated by a spectral break around ion scales. The length\nscale at which this transition occurs is found to be proportional to the ion\ninertial length, $d_i$, for $\\beta \\ll 1$ and to the ion gyroradius, $\\rho_i =\nd_i\\sqrt{\\beta}$, for $\\beta \\gg 1$, i.e., to the larger between the two scales\nin both the extreme regimes. For intermediate cases, i.e., $\\beta \\sim 1$, a\ncombination of the two scales is involved. We infer an empiric relation for the\ndependency of the spectral break on $\\beta$ that provides a good fit over the\nwhole range of values. We compare our results with in situ observations in the\nsolar wind and suggest possible explanations for such a behavior.\n", "  Over the last 20 years Hubble Space Telescope Fine Guidance Sensor\ninterferometric astrometry has produced precise and accurate parallaxes of\nastrophysical interesting stars and mass estimates for stellar companions. We\nreview parallax results, and binary star and exoplanet mass determinations, and\ncompare a subset of these parallaxes with preliminary Gaia results. The\napproach to single-field relative astrometry described herein may continue to\nhave value for targets fainter than the Gaia limit in the coming era of 20-30m\ntelescopes.\n", "  We present the results from our survey of HI 21-cm absorption, using GMRT,\nVLA and WSRT, in a sample of 55 z<0.4 galaxies towards radio sources with\nimpact parameters (b) in the range ~0-35 kpc. In our primary sample (defined\nfor statistical analyses) of 40 quasar-galaxy-pairs (QGPs), probed by 45\nsightlines, we have found seven HI 21-cm absorption detections, two of which\nare reported here for the first time. Combining our primary sample with\nmeasurements having similar optical depth sensitivity ($\\int\\tau dv$ <= 0.3\nkm/s) from the literature, we find a weak anti-correlation (rank correlation\ncoefficient = -0.20 at 2.42sigma level) between $\\int\\tau dv$ and b, consistent\nwith previous literature results. The covering factor of HI 21-cm absorbers\n(C_21) is estimated to be 0.24 (+0.12/-0.08) at b <= 15 kpc and 0.06\n(+0.09/-0.04) at b = 15-35 kpc. $\\int\\tau dv$ and C_21 show similar declining\ntrend with radial distance along the galaxy's major axis and distances scaled\nwith the effective HI radius. There is also tentative indication that most of\nthe HI 21-cm absorbers could be co-planar with the extended HI discs. No\nsignificant dependence of $\\int\\tau dv$ and C_21 on galaxy luminosity, stellar\nmass, colour and star formation rate is found, though the HI 21-cm absorbing\ngas cross-section may be larger for the luminous galaxies. The higher detection\nrate (by a factor of ~4) of HI 21-cm absorption in z<1 DLAs compared to the\nQGPs indicates towards small covering factor and patchy distribution of cold\ngas clouds around low-z galaxies.\n", "  Just as turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere can severely limit the angular\nresolution of optical telescopes, turbulence in the ionized interstellar medium\nfundamentally limits the resolution of radio telescopes. We present a\nscattering mitigation framework for radio imaging with very long baseline\ninterferometry (VLBI) that partially overcomes this limitation. Our framework,\n\"stochastic optics,\" derives from a simplification of strong interstellar\nscattering to separate small-scale (\"diffractive\") effects from large-scale\n(\"refractive\") effects, thereby separating deterministic and random\ncontributions to the scattering. Stochastic optics extends traditional\nsynthesis imaging by simultaneously reconstructing an unscattered image and its\nrefractive perturbations. Its advantages over direct imaging come from\nutilizing the many deterministic properties of the scattering -- such as the\ntime-averaged \"blurring,\" polarization independence, and the deterministic\nevolution in frequency and time -- while still accounting for the stochastic\nimage distortions on large scales. These distortions are identified in the\nimage reconstructions through regularization by their time-averaged power\nspectrum. Using synthetic data, we show that this framework effectively removes\nthe blurring from diffractive scattering while reducing the spurious image\nfeatures from refractive scattering. Stochastic optics can provide significant\nimprovements over existing scattering mitigation strategies and is especially\npromising for imaging the Galactic Center supermassive black hole, Sagittarius\nA*, with the Global mm-VLBI Array and with the Event Horizon Telescope.\n", "  The variation of the vector magnetic field along structures in the solar\ncorona remains unmeasured. Using a unique combination of spectropolarimetry and\nstereoscopy, we infer and compare the vector magnetic field structure and\nthree-dimensional morphology of an individuated coronal loop structure\nundergoing a thermal instability. We analyze spectropolarimetric data of the He\nI 10830 {\\AA} triplet ($1s2s{\\ }^{3}S_{1} - 1s2p{\\ }^{3}P_{2,1,0}$) obtained at\nthe Dunn Solar Telescope with the Facility Infrared Spectropolarimeter on 19\nSeptember 2011. Cool coronal loops are identified by their prominent drainage\nsignatures in the He I data (redshifts up to 185 km sec$^{-1}$). Extinction of\nEUV background radiation along these loops is observed by both the Atmospheric\nImaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Extreme\nUltraviolet Imager onboard spacecraft A of the Solar Terrestrial Relations\nObservatory, and is used to stereoscopically triangulate the loop geometry up\nto heights of 70 Mm ($0.1$ $R_{sun}$) above the solar surface. The He I\npolarized spectra along this loop exhibit signatures indicative of atomic-level\npolarization as well as magnetic signatures through the Hanle and Zeeman\neffects. Spectropolarimetric inversions indicate that the magnetic field is\ngenerally oriented along the coronal loop axis, and provide the height\ndependence of the magnetic field intensity. The technique we demonstrate is a\npowerful one that may help better understand the thermodynamics of coronal fine\nstructure magnetism.\n", "  The recently discovered vast thin plane of dwarf satellites orbiting the\nAndromeda Galaxy (M31) adds to the mystery of the small scale distribution of\nthe Local Group's galaxy population. Such well defined planar structures are\napparently rare occurrences in cold dark matter cosmological simulations, and\nwe lack a coherent explanation of their formation and existence. In this paper,\nwe explore the long-term survivability of thin planes of dwarfs in galactic\nhalos, focusing, in particular, on systems mimicking the observed Andromeda\ndistribution. The key results show that, in general, planes of dwarf galaxies\nare fragile, sensitive to the shape of the dark matter halo and other\nperturbing effects. In fact, long lived planes of satellites only exist in\npolar orbits in spherical dark matter halos, presenting a challenge to the\nobserved Andromeda plane which is significantly tilted with respect to the\noptical disk. Our conclusion is that, in standard cosmological models, planes\nof satellites are generally short lived, and hence we must be located at a\nrelatively special time in the evolution of the Andromeda Plane, lucky enough\nto see its coherent pattern.\n", "  We present the first analysis of W Vir stars observed by the Kepler space\ntelescope in the K2 mission. Clear cycle-to-cycle variation were detected in\nthe light curves of KT Sco and the globular cluster member M80-V1. While the\nvariations in the former star seems to be irregular on the short time scale of\nthe K2 data, the latter appears to experience period doubling in its pulsation.\nGround-based colour data confirmed that both stars are W Vir-type pulsators,\nwhile a comparison with historical photometric time-series data revealed\ndrastic period changes in both stars. For comparison we reexamine ground-based\nobservations of W Vir, the prototype of the class, and conclude that it shows\nperiod doubling instead of mode beating. These results support the notion that\nnonlinear dynamics plays an important role in the pulsation of W Virginis-type\nstars.\n", "  Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) is a promising material as an absorber in photovoltaic\napplications. The measured efficiency, however, is far from the theoretically\npredicted value for the known CZTS phases. To improve the understanding of this\ndiscrepancy we investigate the structural, dynamical, and dielectric of the\nthree main phases of CZTS (kesterite, stannite, and PMCA) using density\nfunctional perturbation theory (DFPT). The effect of the exchange-correlation\nfunctional on the computed properties is analyzed. A qualitative agreement of\nthe theoretical Raman spectrum with measurements is observed. However, none of\nthe phases correspond to the experimental spectrum within the error bar that is\nusually to be expected for DFPT. This corroborates the need to consider cation\ndisorder and other lattice defects extensively in this material.\n", "  We present photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations of\nshort-period variables discovered in the OmegaWhite survey: a wide-field\nhigh-cadence g-band synoptic survey targeting the Galactic Plane. We have used\nfast photometry on the SAAO 1.0-m and 1.9-m telescopes to obtain light curves\nof 27 variables, and use these results to validate the period and amplitude\nestimates from the OmegaWhite processing pipeline. Furthermore, 57 sources (44\nunique, 13 also with new light curves) were selected for spectroscopic\nfollow-up using either the SAAO 1.9-m telescope or the Southern African Large\nTelescope. We find many of these variables have spectra which are consistent\nwith being delta Scuti type pulsating stars. At higher amplitudes, we detect\nfour possible pulsating white dwarf/subdwarf sources and an eclipsing\ncataclysmic variable. Due to their rarity, these targets are ideal candidates\nfor detailed follow-up studies. From spectroscopy, we confirm the symbiotic\nbinary star nature of two variables identified as such in the SIMBAD database.\nWe also report what could possibly be the first detection of the `Bump Cepheid'\nphenomena in a delta Scuti star, with OW J175848.21-271653.7 showing a\npronounced 22% amplitude dip lasting 3 minutes during each pulsational cycle\npeak. However, the precise nature of this target is still uncertain as it\nexhibits the spectral features of a B-type star.\n", "  The non-resonant two-photon one-electron ionization of neutral atoms is\nstudied theoretically in the framework of relativistic second-order\nperturbation theory and independent particle approximation. In particular, the\nimportance of relativistic and screening effects in the total two-photon\nionization cross section is investigated. Detailed computations have been\ncarried out for the K-shell ionization of neutral Ne, Ge, Xe, and U atoms. The\nrelativistic effects significantly decrease the total cross section, for the\ncase of U, for example, they reduce the total cross section by a factor of two.\nMoreover, we have found that the account for the screening effects of the\nremaining electrons leads to occurrence of an unexpected minimum in the total\ncross section at the total photon energies equal to the ionization threshold,\nfor the case of Ne, for example, the cross section drops there by a factor of\nthree.\n", "  We present the results of our survey of 1612 MHz circumstellar OH maser\nemission from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and red supergiants (RSGs) in\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud. We have discovered four new circumstellar maser\nsources in the LMC, and increased the number of reliable wind speeds from IR\nstars in the LMC from 5 to 13. Using our new wind speeds, as well as those from\nGalactic sources, we have derived an updated relation for dust driven winds:\n$v_{exp} \\propto Z L^{0.4}$. We compare the sub-solar metallicity LMC OH/IR\nstars with carefully selected samples of more metal-rich OH/IR stars, also at\nknown distances, in the Galactic Centre and Galactic Bulge. For 8 of the Bulge\nstars we derive pulsation periods for the first time, using near-IR photometry\nfrom the VVV survey. We have modeled our LMC OH/IR stars and developed an\nempirical method of deriving gas-to-dust ratios and mass loss rates by scaling\nthe models to the results from maser profiles. We have done this also for\nsamples in the Galactic Centre and Bulge and derived a new mass loss\nprescription that includes luminosity, pulsation period, and gas-to-dust ratio\n$\\dot{M} = 1.06^{+3.5}_{-0.8} \\rm{ \\cdot\n}10^{-5}\\,(L/10^4\\,\\rm{L}_\\odot)^{0.9\\pm0.1}(P/500\\,\\rm{d})^{0.75\\pm0.3}\n(r_{gd}/200)^{-0.03\\pm0.07}\\,\\rm{M_{\\odot}}\\, yr^{-1}$. The tightest\ncorrelation is found between mass loss rate and luminosity. We find that the\ngas-to-dust ratio has little effect on the mass loss of oxygen-rich AGB stars\nand RSGs within the Galaxy and the LMC. This suggests that mass loss of\noxygen-rich AGB stars and RSGs is (nearly) independent of metallicity between a\nhalf and twice solar.\n", "  We study the impact of star-forming mini-haloes, and the Initial Mass\nFunction (IMF) of Population III (Pop III) stars, on the Galactic halo\nMetallicity Distribution Function (MDF) and on the properties of C-enhanced and\nC-normal stars at [Fe/H]<-3. For our investigation we use a data-constrained\nmerger tree model for the Milky Way formation, which has been improved to\nself-consistently describe the physical processes regulating star-formation in\nmini-haloes, including the poor sampling of the Pop III IMF. We find that only\nwhen star-forming mini-haloes are included the low-Fe tail of the MDF is\ncorrectly reproduced, showing a plateau that is built up by C-enhanced\nmetal-poor (CEMP) stars imprinted by primordial faint supernovae. The\nincomplete sampling of the Pop III IMF in inefficiently star-forming\nmini-haloes (< $10^{-3}$ $M_\\odot$/yr) strongly limits the formation of Pair\nInstability Supernovae (PISNe), with progenitor masses $m_{\\rm\npopIII}$=[140-260] $M_\\odot$, even when a flat Pop III IMF is assumed.\nSecond-generation stars formed in environments polluted at >50% level by PISNe\nare thus extremely rare, corresponding to $\\approx$ 0.25% of the total stellar\npopulation at [Fe/H]<-2, which is consistent with recent observations. The\nlow-Fe tail of the MDF strongly depends on the Pop III IMF shape and mass\nrange. Given the current statistics, we find that a flat Pop III IMF model with\n$m_{\\rm popIII}$=[10-300] $M_\\odot$ is disfavoured by observations. We present\ntestable predictions for Pop III stars extending down to lower masses, with\n$m_{\\rm popIII}$=[0.1-300] $M_\\odot$.\n", "  Observations of the Ultra Luminous X-ray source (ULX) Holmberg IX X-1 were\ncarried out with Suzaku twice, once on 2012 April 13 and then on 2012 October\n24, with exposures of 180 ks and 217 ks, respectively. The source showed a hard\npower-law shape spectrum with a mild cutoff at $\\sim 8$ keV, which is typical\nof ULXs when they are relatively dim. On both occasions, the 0.6-11 keV\nspectrum was explained successfully in terms a cool ($\\sim 0.2$ keV)\nmulti-color disk blackbody emission model and a thermal Comptonization emission\nproduced by an electron cloud with a relatively low temperature and high\noptical depth, assuming that a large fraction of the disk-blackbody photons are\nComptonized whereas the rest is observed directly. The 0.5-10 keV luminosity\nwas $1.2\\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in April, and $\\sim 14\\%$ higher in\nOctober. This brightening was accompanied by spectral softening in $\\ge 2$ keV,\nwith little changes in the $\\le 2$ keV spectral shape. This behavior can be\nunderstood if the accretion disk remains unchanged, while the electron cloud\ncovers a variable fraction of the disk. The absorbing column density was\nconsistent with the galactic line-of sight value, and did not vary by more than\n$1.6\\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. Together with the featureless spectra, these\nproperties may not be reconciled easily with the super-critical accretion\nscenario of this source.\n", "  Detection of blazar pc scale counter-jets is difficult, but it can provide\ninvaluable insight into the relativistic effects, radiative processes and the\ncomplex mechanisms of jet production, collimation and accelation in blazars. We\nbuild on recent populations models (optimized using the MOJAVE apparent\nvelocity and redshift distributions) in order to derive the distribution of\njet-to-counter-jet ratios and the flux densities of the counter-jet at\ndifferent frequencies, in an effort to set minimum sensitivity limits required\nfor existing and future telescope arrays in order to detect these elusive\ncounter-jets. We find that: for the BL Lacs $5\\%$ of their counter-jets have a\nflux-density higher than 100mJy, $15\\%$ are higher than 10 mJy, and $32\\%$ have\nhigher flux-density than 1 mJy, whereas for the FSRQs $8\\%$ have a flux-density\nhigher than 10mJy, $17\\%$ are higher than 1 mJy, and $32\\%$ are higher than 0.1\nmJy (at 15 GHz). Future telescopes like the SKA and newly operating like\ne-MERLIN and JVLA may detect up to $99\\%$ of the BL Lac and $77\\%$ of the FSRQ\ncounter-jets. Sources with both low apparent velocity and a low Doppler factor\nmake prime candidates for counter-jet detection. Combining our findings with\nliterature values we have identified five such counter-jet detection\ncandidates. Finally, we discuss possible effects beyond relativistic deboosting\nthat may complicate the detection of counter-jets and that need to be accounted\nfor in the interpretation of detections.\n", "  We study the average Ly$\\alpha$ emission associated with high-$z$ strong (log\n$N$(H I) $\\ge$ 21) damped Ly$\\alpha$ systems (DLAs). We report Ly$\\alpha$\nluminosities ($L_{\\rm Ly\\alpha}$) for the full as well as various sub-samples\nbased on $N$(H I), $z$, $(r-i)$ colours of QSOs and rest equivalent width of Si\nII$\\lambda$1526 line (i.e., $W_{1526}$). For the full sample, we find $L_{\\rm\nLy\\alpha}$$< 10^{41} (3\\sigma)\\ \\rm erg\\ s^{-1}$ with a $2.8\\sigma$ level\ndetection of Ly$\\alpha$ emission in the red part of the DLA trough. The $L_{\\rm\nLy\\alpha}$ is found to be higher for systems with higher $W_{1526}$ with its\npeak, detected at $\\geq 3\\sigma$, redshifted by about 300-400 $\\rm km\\ s^{-1}$\nwith respect to the systemic absorption redshift, as seen in Lyman Break\nGalaxies (LBGs) and Ly$\\alpha$ emitters. A clear signature of a double-hump\nLy$\\alpha$ profile is seen when we consider $W_{1526} \\ge 0.4$ \\AA\\ and $(r-i)\n< 0.05$. Based on the known correlation between metallicity and $W_{1526}$, we\ninterpret our results in terms of star formation rate (SFR) being higher in\nhigh metallicity (mass) galaxies with high velocity fields that facilitates\neasy Ly$\\alpha$ escape. The measured Ly$\\alpha$ surface brightness requires\nlocal ionizing radiation that is 4 to 10 times stronger than the metagalactic\nUV background at these redshifts. The relationship between the SFR and surface\nmass density of atomic gas seen in DLAs is similar to that of local dwarf and\nmetal poor galaxies. We show that the low luminosity galaxies will contribute\nappreciably to the stacked spectrum if the size-luminosity relation seen for H\nI at low-$z$ is also present at high-$z$. Alternatively, large Ly$\\alpha$ halos\nseen around LBGs could also explain our measurements.\n", "  Theoretical studies on the response of interstellar gas to a gravitational\npotential disc with a quasi-stationary spiral arm pattern suggest that the gas\nexperiences a sudden compression due to standing shock waves at spiral arms.\nThis mechanism, called a galactic shock wave, predicts that gas spiral arms\nmove from downstream to upstream of stellar arms with increasing radius inside\na corotation radius. In order to investigate if this mechanism is at work in\nthe grand-design spiral galaxy M51, we have measured azimuthal offsets between\nthe peaks of stellar mass and gas mass distributions in its two spiral arms.\nThe stellar mass distribution is created by the spatially resolved spectral\nenergy distribution fitting to optical and near infrared images, while the gas\nmass distribution is obtained by high-resolution CO and HI data. For the inner\nregion (r < 150\"), we find that one arm is consistent with the galactic shock\nwhile the other is not. For the outer region, results are less certain due to\nthe narrower range of offset values, the weakness of stellar arms, and the\nsmaller number of successful offset measurements. The results suggest that the\nnature of two inner spiral arms are different, which is likely due to an\ninteraction with the companion galaxy.\n", "  Post-main-sequence planetary science has been galvanised by the striking\nvariability, depth and shape of the photometric transit curves due to objects\norbiting white dwarf WD 1145+017, a star which also hosts a dusty debris disc\nand circumstellar gas, and displays strong metal atmospheric pollution.\nHowever, the physical properties of the likely asteroid which is discharging\ndisintegrating fragments remain largely unconstrained from the observations.\nThis process has not yet been modelled numerically. Here, we use the N-body\ncode PKDGRAV to compute dissipation properties for asteroids of different\nspins, densities, masses, and eccentricities. We simulate both homogeneous and\ndifferentiated asteroids, for up to two years, and find that the disruption\ntimescale is strongly dependent on density and eccentricity, but weakly\ndependent on mass and spin. We find that primarily rocky differentiated bodies\nwith moderate (~3-4 g/cm^3) bulk densities on near-circular (e <~ 0.1) orbits\ncan remain intact while occasionally shedding mass from their mantles. These\nresults suggest that the asteroid orbiting WD 1145+017 is differentiated,\nresides just outside of the Roche radius for bulk density but just inside the\nRoche radius for mantle density, and is more akin physically to an asteroid\nlike Vesta instead of one like Itokawa.\n", "  Although mid-to-late type M dwarfs are the most common stars in our stellar\nneighborhood, our knowledge of these objects is still limited. Open questions\ninclude the evolution of their angular momentum, internal structures, dust\nsettling in their atmospheres, age dispersion within populations. In addition,\nat young ages, late-type Ms have masses below the hydrogen burning limit and\ntherefore are key objects in the debate on the brown dwarf mechanism of\nformation. In this work we determine and study in detail the physical\nparameters of two samples of young, late M-type sources belonging to either the\nChamaeleon I Dark Cloud or the TW Hydrae Association and compare them with the\nresults obtained in the literature for other young clusters and also for older,\nfield, dwarfs. We used multi-wavelength photometry to construct and analyze\nSEDs to determine general properties of the photosphere and disk presence. We\nalso used low resolution optical and near-infrared spectroscopy to study\nactivity, accretion, gravity and effective temperature sensitive indicators. We\npropose a VO-based spectral index that is both temperature and age sensitive.\nWe derived physical parameters using independent techniques confirming the\nalready common feature/problem of the age/luminosity spread. In particular, we\nhighlight two brown dwarfs showing very similar temperatures but clearly\ndifferent surface gravity (explained invoking extreme early accretion). We also\nshow how, despite large improvement in the dust treatment in theoretical\nmodels, there is still room for further progress in the simultaneous\nreproduction of the optical and near-infrared features of these cold young\nobjects.\n", "  Application of fitting techniques to obtain physical parameters---such as\nages, metallicities, and $\\alpha$-element to iron ratios---of stellar\npopulations is an important approach to understand the nature of both galaxies\nand globular clusters (GCs). In fact, fitting methods based on different\nunderlying models may yield different results, and with varying precision. In\nthis paper, we have selected 22 confirmed M31 GCs for which we do not have\naccess to previously known spectroscopic metallicities. Most are located at\napproximately one degree (in projection) from the galactic center. We performed\nspectroscopic observations with the 6.5 m MMT telescope, equipped with its Red\nChannel Spectrograph. Lick/IDS absorption-line indices, radial velocities,\nages, and metallicities were derived based on the $\\rm EZ\\_Ages$ stellar\npopulation parameter calculator. We also applied full spectral fitting with the\nULySS code to constrain the parameters of our sample star clusters. In\naddition, we performed $\\chi^2_{\\rm min}$ fitting of the clusters' Lick/IDS\nindices with different models, including the Bruzual & Charlot models (adopting\nChabrier or Salpeter stellar initial mass functions and 1994 or 2000 Padova\nstellar evolutionary tracks), the GALEV, and the Thomas et al. models. For\ncomparison, we collected their $UVBRIJK$ photometry from the Revised Bologna\nCatalogue (v.5) to obtain and fit the GCs' spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs). Finally, we performed fits using a combination of Lick/IDS indices and\nSEDs. The latter results are more reliable and the associated error bars become\nsignificantly smaller than those resulting from either our Lick/IDS\nindices-only or our SED-only fits.\n", "  GeCu2O4 exhibits a tetragonal spinel structure due to the strong Jahn-Teller\ndistortion associated with Cu2+ ions. We show that its magnetic structure can\nbe described as slabs composed of a pair of layers with orthogonally oriented\nspin 1/2 Cu chains in the basal ab plane. The spins between the two layers\nwithin a slab are collinearly aligned while the spin directions of neighboring\nslabs are perpendicular to each other. Interestingly, we find that spins along\neach chain form an unusual up-up-down-down (UUDD) pattern, suggesting a\nnon-negligible nearest-neighbor biquadratic exchange interaction in the\neffective classical spin Hamiltonian. We hypothesize that spin-orbit coupling\nand orbital mixing of Cu2+ ions in this system is non-negligible, which calls\nfor future calculations using perturbation theory with extended Hilbert (spin\nand orbital) space and calculations based on density functional theory\nincluding spin-orbit coupling and looking at the global stability of the UUDD\nstate.\n", "  Symbiotic stars are regarded as wide binary systems consisting of a hot white\ndwarf and a mass losing giant. They exhibit unique spectral features at 6825\n\\AA\\ and 7082 \\AA, which are formed via Raman scattering of\n\\ion{O}{6}$\\lambda\\lambda$ 1032 and 1038 with atomic hydrogen. We adopt a Monte\nCarlo technique to generate the same number of \\ion{O}{6}$\\lambda$1032 and\n$\\lambda$1038 line photons and compute the flux ratio $F(6825)/F(7082)$ of\nthese Raman scattered \\ion{O}{6} features formed in neutral regions with a\nsimple geometric shape as a function of \\ion{H}{1} column density $N_{HI}$. In\ncylindrical and spherical neutral regions with the \\ion{O}{6} source embedded\ninside, the flux ratio $F(6825)/F(7082)$ shows an overall decrease from 3 to 1\nas $N_{HI}$ increases in the range $10^{22-24}{\\rm\\ cm^{-2}}$. In the cases of\na slab geometry and other geometries with the \\ion{O}{6} source outside the\n\\ion{H}{1} region, Rayleigh escape operates to lower the flux ratio\nconsiderably. For moderate values of $N_{HI}\\sim 10^{23}{\\rm\\ cm^{-2}}$ the\nflux ratio behaves in a complicated way to exhibit a broad bump with a peak\nvalue of 3.5 in the case of a sphere geometry. We find that the ratio of Raman\nconversion efficiencies of \\ion{O}{6}$\\lambda\\lambda$1032, 1038 ranges from 0.8\nto 3.5. Our high resolution spectra of 'D' type HM~Sge and 'S' type AG~Dra\nobtained with the {\\it Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope} show that the flux ratio\n$F(6825)/F(7082)$ of AG~Dra is significantly smaller than that of HM~Sge,\nimplying that 'S' type symbiotics are characterized by higher $N_{HI}$ than 'D'\ntype symbiotics.\n", "  Warped discs have been found on (sub-)parsec scale in some nearby Seyfert\nnuclei, identified by their maser emission. Using dust radiative transfer\nsimulations we explore their observational signatures in the infrared in order\nto find out whether they can partly replace the molecular torus. Strong\nvariations of the brightness distributions are found, depending on the\norientation of the warp with respect to the line of sight. Whereas images at\nshort wavelengths typically show a disc-like and a point source component, the\nwarp itself only becomes visible at far-infrared wavelengths. A similar variety\nis visible in the shapes of the spectral energy distributions. Especially for\nclose to edge-on views, the models show silicate feature strengths ranging from\ndeep absorption to strong emission for variations of the lines of sight towards\nthe warp. To test the applicability of our model, we use the case of the\nCircinus galaxy, where infrared interferometry has revealed a highly elongated\nemission component matching a warped maser disc in orientation and size. Our\nmodel is for the first time able to present a physical explanation for the\nobserved dust morphology as coming from the AGN heated dust. As opposed to\navailable torus models, a warped disc morphology produces a variety of silicate\nfeature shapes for grazing lines of sight, close to an edge-on view. This could\nbe an attractive alternative to a claimed change of the dust composition for\nthe case of the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068, which harbours a warped maser\ndisc as well.\n", "  In Torne et al. (2015), we showed detections of SGR J1745-2900 up to 225 GHz\n(1.33 mm); at that time the highest radio frequency detection of pulsar\nemission. In this work, we present the results of new observations of the same\nmagnetar with detections up to 291 GHz (1.03 mm), together with evidence of\nlinear polarization in its millimetre emission. SGR J1745-2900 continues to\nshow variability and is, on average, a factor $\\sim$4 brighter in the\nmillimetre band than in our observations of July 2014. The new measured\nspectrum is slightly inverted, with $\\left<\\alpha\\right> = +0.4\\pm0.2$ (for\n$S_{\\nu} \\propto \\nu^{\\alpha})$. However, the spectrum does not seem to be well\ndescribed by a single power law, which might be due to the intrinsic\nvariability of the source, or perhaps a turn-up somewhere between 8.35 and 87\nGHz. These results may help us to improve our still incomplete model of pulsar\nemission and, in addition, they further support the search for and study of\npulsars located at the Galactic Centre using millimetre wavelengths.\n", "  We present phase curves of Jupiter from 0-140 degrees as measured in multiple\noptical bandpasses by Cassini/ISS during the Millennium flyby of Jupiter in\nlate 2000 to early 2001. Phase curves are of interest for studying the energy\nbalance of Jupiter and understanding the scattering behavior of Jupiter as an\nexoplanet analog. We find that Jupiter is significantly darker at partial\nphases than an idealized Lambertian planet by roughly 25% and is not well fit\nby Jupiter-like exoplanet atmospheric models across all wavelengths. We provide\nanalytic fits to Jupiter's phase function in several Cassini/ISS imaging filter\nbandpasses. In addition, these observations show that Jupiter's color is more\nvariable with phase angle than predicted by models. Therefore, the color of\neven a near Jupiter-twin planet observed at a partial phase cannot be assumed\nto be comparable to that of Jupiter at full phase. We discuss how WFIRST and\nother future direct-imaging missions can enhance the study of cool giants.\n", "  We construct a new family of models of our Galaxy in which dark matter and\ndisc stars are both represented by distribution functions that are analytic\nfunctions of the action integrals of motion. The potential that is\nself-consistently generated by the dark matter, stars and gas is determined,\nand parameters in the distribution functions are adjusted until the model is\ncompatible with observational constraints on the circular-speed curve, the\nvertical density profile of the stellar disc near the Sun, the kinematics of\nnearly 200 000 giant stars within 2 kpc of the Sun, and estimates of the\noptical depth to microlensing of bulge stars. We find that the data require a\ndark halo in which the phase-space density is approximately constant for\nactions |J| \\lesssim 140 kpc km ^-1. In real space these haloes have core radii\n~ 2 kpc.\n", "  We analyse the evolution of cosmological perturbations which leads to the\nformation of large isolated voids in the Universe. We assume that initial\nperturbations are spherical and all components of the Universe (radiation,\nmatter and dark energy) are continuous media with perfect fluid\nenergy--momentum tensors, which interact only gravitationally. Equations of the\nevolution of perturbations for every component in the comoving to cosmological\nbackground reference frame are obtained from equations of energy and momentum\nconservation and Einstein's ones and are integrated numerically. Initial\nconditions are set at the early stage of evolution in the radiation-dominated\nepoch, when the scale of perturbation is much larger than the particle horizon.\nResults show how the profiles of density and velocity of matter and dark energy\nare formed and how they depend on parameters of dark energy and initial\nconditions. In particular, it is shown that final matter density and velocity\namplitudes change within range $\\sim$4-7\\% when the value of equation-of-state\nparameter of dark energy $w$ vary in the range from --0.8 to --1.2, and change\nwithin $\\sim$1\\% only when the value of effective sound speed of dark energy\nvary over all allowable range of its values.\n", "  It is largely recognized that Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) jets involve\nultra-relativistic motion. However, the value of the Lorentz factor Gamma_0 is\nstill not clear and only lower limits are known for most bursts. We suggest\nhere a new method to obtain upper limits on Gamma_0. The early high-energy\nsynchrotron afterglow flux depends strongly on Gamma_0. Upper limits on GeV\nemission therefore provide uppers limit on Gamma_0. Applying this method to 190\nFermi GRBs that have not been detected by the Fermi-LAT we place upper limits\non the high-energy afterglow flux, and in turn on Gamma_0. For bursts at a\ntypical redshift z=2, we find values of the order of 200 (and above) for a\nhomogeneous density medium, and in the range 100-400 for a wind-like medium.\nThese upper limits are consistent with (and are very close to) lower limits and\ndirect estimates inferred using other methods, suggesting that the typical\nLorentz factors of GRB jets are of order a few hundred.\n", "  We perform integrated spectroscopy of 24 Galactic globular clusters. Spectra\nare observed from one core radius for each cluster with a high wavelength\nresolution of ~2.0 A FWHM. In combination with two existing data sets from\nPuzia et al. (2002) and Schiavon et al. (2005), we construct a large database\nof Lick spectral indices for a total of 53 Galactic globular clusters with a\nwide range of metallicities, -2.4 < [Fe/H] < 0.1, and various horizontal-branch\nmorphologies. The empirical index-to-metallicity conversion relationships are\nprovided for the 20 Lick indices for the use of deriving metallicities for\nremote, unresolved stellar systems.\n", "  Astronomers are entering an era of {\\mu}as-level astrometry utilizing the\n5-decade-old IAU Galactic coordinate system that was only originally defined to\n$\\sim$0{\\deg}.1 accuracy, and where the dynamical centre of the Galaxy (Sgr A*)\nis located $\\sim$0{\\deg}.07 from the origin. We calculate new independent\nestimates of the North Galactic Pole (NGP) using recent catalogues of Galactic\ndisc tracer objects such as embedded and open clusters, infrared bubbles, dark\nclouds, and young massive stars. Using these catalogues, we provide two new\nestimates of the NGP. Solution 1 is an \"unconstrained\" NGP determined by the\ngalactic tracer sources, which does not take into account the location of Sgr\nA*, and which lies 90{\\deg}.120$\\,\\pm\\,$0{\\deg}.029 from Sgr A*, and Solution 2\nis a \"constrained\" NGP which lies exactly 90{\\deg} from Sgr A*. The\n\"unconstrained\" NGP has ICRS position: $\\alpha_{NGP}$ = 192{\\deg}.729 $\\,\\pm\\,$\n0{\\deg}.035, $\\delta_{NGP}$ = 27{\\deg}.084 $\\,\\pm\\,$ 0{\\deg}.023 and $\\theta\\,$\n= 122{\\deg}.928 $\\,\\pm\\,$ 0{\\deg}.016. The \"constrained\" NGP which lies exactly\n90{\\deg} away from Sgr A* has ICRS position: $\\alpha_{NGP}$ = 192{\\deg}.728\n$\\,\\pm\\,$0{\\deg}.010, $\\delta_{NGP}$ = 26{\\deg}.863 $\\,\\pm\\,$ 0{\\deg}.019 and\n$\\theta\\,$ = 122{\\deg}.928 $\\,\\pm\\,$ 0{\\deg}.016. The difference between the\nsolutions is likely due to the Sun lying above the Galactic midplane.\nConsidering the angular separation between Sgr A* and our unconstrained NGP,\nand if one adopts the recent estimate of the Galactocentric distance for the\nSun of $R_{0}$ = 8.2$\\,\\pm\\,$0.1 kpc, then we estimate that the Sun lies\n$z_{\\odot}$ $\\simeq$ 17$\\,\\pm\\,$5 pc above the Galactic midplane. Our value of\n$z_{\\odot}$ is consistent with the true median of 55 previous estimates\npublished over the past century of the Sun's height above the Galactic\nmid-plane ($z_{\\odot}$ $\\simeq$ 17$\\,\\pm\\,$2 pc).\n", "  It is well known that clusters of massive stars are influenced by the\npresence of strong winds, that they are sources of diffuse X-rays from shocked\ngas, and that this gas can be vented into the surrounding region or the halo\nthrough the champagne effect. However, the details of how these different\nenvironments interact and evolve are far from complete. This paper attributes\nthe broad C IV 1500 absorption features (extending to -1900 \\kms) that are seen\nin the spectra of main sequence B stars in NGC 6231 to gas in the cluster\nenvironment and not the B stars themselves. It is shown that the presence of a\nWC star, WR 79, in the cluster makes this gas detectable because its wind\nenriches the cluster gas with carbon. Given the available data, it is not clear\nwhether the absorbing gas is simply the far wind of WR 79 or a collective\ncluster wind enriched by carbon from the wind of WR 79. If it is simply due to\nthe wind, then this wind must flow, unimpeded for more than 2 pc, suggesting\nthat the inner region of the cluster is nearly devoid of obstructing material.\nIf it is actually a collective wind from the cluster, then we could be\nwitnessing an important stage of galactic feedback. In either case, the\nobservations provide a unique and significant piece to the puzzle of how\nmassive, open clusters evolve.\n", "  It is well-known that extreme ultraviolet emission emitted at the solar\nsurface is absorbed by overlying cool plasma. Especially in active regions dark\nlanes in EUV images suggest that much of the surface activity is obscured.\nSimultaneous observations from IRIS, consisting of UV spectra and slit-jaw\nimages give vital information with sub-arcsecond spatial resolution on the\ndynamics of jets not seen in EUV images. We studied a series of small jets from\nrecently formed bipole pairs beside the trailing spot of active region 11991,\nwhich occurred on 2014 March 5 from 15:02:21 UT to 17:04:07 UT. There were\ncollimated outflows with bright roots in the SJI 1400 {\\AA} (transition region)\nand 2796 {\\AA} (upper chromosphere) that were mostly not seen in AIA 304 {\\AA}\n(transition region) and AIA 171 \\AA\\ (lower corona) images. The Si IV spectra\nshow strong blue-wing but no red-wing enhancements in the line profiles of the\nejecta for all recurrent jets indicating outward flows without twists. We see\ntwo types of Mg II line profiles produced by the jets spires: reversed and\nnon-reversed. Mg II lines remain optically thick but turn into optically thin\nin the highly Doppler shifted wings.The energy flux contained in each recurrent\njet is estimated using a velocity differential emission measure technique which\nmeasures the emitting power of the plasma as a function of line-of-sight\nvelocity. We found that all the recurrent jets release similar energy (10$^8$\nerg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ ) toward the corona and the downward component is less\nthan 3\\%.\n", "  The Hubble Space Telescope UV Legacy survey of Galactic Globular Clusters\n(GC) is characterising many different aspects of their multiple stellar\npopulations. The \"Grundahl-jump\" (G-jump) is a discontinuity in ultraviolet\nbrightness of blue horizontal branch (HB) stars, signalling the onset of\nradiative metal levitation. The HB Legacy data confirmed that the G-jump is\nlocated at the same T$_{eff}$ ($\\simeq$11,500 K) in nearly all clusters. The\nonly exceptions are the metal-rich clusters NGC 6388 and NGC 6441, where the\nG-jump occurs at T$_{eff}\\simeq$13-14,000K. We compute synthetic HB models\nbased on new evolutionary tracks including the effect of helium diffusion, and\napproximately accounting for the effect of metal levitation in a stable\natmosphere. Our models show that the G-jump location depends on the interplay\nbetween the timescale of diffusion and the timescale of the evolution in the\nT$_{eff}$ range 11,500 K$\\lessapprox$T$_{eff}\\lessapprox$14,000 K. The G-jump\nbecomes hotter than 11,500 K only for stars that have, in this T$_{eff}$ range,\na helium mass fraction Y>0.35. Similarly high Y values are also consistent with\nthe modelling of the HB in NGC 6388 and NGC 6441. In these clusters we predict\nthat a significant fraction of HB stars show helium in their spectra above\n11,500 K, and full helium settling should only be found beyond the hotter\nG-jump.\n", "  The \"Magnificent Seven\" (M7) are a group of radio-quiet Isolated Neutron\nStars (INSs) discovered in the soft X-rays through their purely thermal surface\nemission. Owing to the large inferred magnetic fields ($B\\approx 10^{13}$ G),\nradiation from these sources is expected to be substantially polarised,\nindependently on the mechanism actually responsible for the thermal emission. A\nlarge observed polarisation degree is, however, expected only if\nquantum-electrodynamics (QED) polarisation effects are present in the\nmagnetised vacuum around the star. The detection of a strongly linearly\npolarised signal would therefore provide the first observational evidence of\nQED effects in the strong-field regime. While polarisation measurements in the\nsoft X-rays are not feasible yet, optical polarisation measurements are within\nreach also for quite faint targets, like the M7 which have optical counterparts\nwith magnitudes $\\approx 26$--$28$. Here, we report on the measurement of\noptical linear polarisation for the prototype, and brightest member, of the\nclass, RX\\, J1856.5$-$3754 ($V\\sim 25.5$), the first ever for one of the M7,\nobtained with the Very Large Telescope. We measured a polarisation degree\n$\\mathrm{P.D.} =16.43\\% \\pm5.26\\%$ and a polarisation position angle\n$\\mathrm{P.A.}=145\\fdg39\\pm9\\fdg44$, computed east of the North Celestial\nMeridian. The $\\mathrm{P.D.}$ that we derive is large enough to support the\npresence of vacuum birefringence, as predicted by QED.\n", "  We investigate the valence quark distribution function of the pion\n$v^{\\pi}(x,Q^2)$ in the framework of the chiral constituent quark model and\nevaluate the meson cloud effects on $v^{\\pi}(x,Q^2)$. We explicitly demonstrate\nhow the meson cloud effects affect $v^{\\pi}(x,Q^2)$ in detail. We find that the\nmeson cloud correction causes an overall 32\\% reduction of the valence quark\ndistribution and an enhancement at the small Bjorken $x$ regime. Besides, we\nalso find that the dressing effect of the meson cloud will make the valence\nquark distribution to be softer in the large $x$ region.\n", "  To calculate realistic models of objects with Ni in their atmospheres,\naccurate atomic data for the relevant ionization stages needs to be included in\nmodel atmosphere calculations. In the context of white dwarf stars, we\ninvestigate the effect of changing the Ni {\\sc iv}-{\\sc vi} bound-bound and\nbound-free atomic data has on model atmosphere calculations. Models including\nPICS calculated with {\\sc autostructure} show significant flux attenuation of\nup to $\\sim 80$\\% shortward of 180\\AA\\, in the EUV region compared to a model\nusing hydrogenic PICS. Comparatively, models including a larger set of Ni\ntransitions left the EUV, UV, and optical continua unaffected. We use models\ncalculated with permutations of this atomic data to test for potential changes\nto measured metal abundances of the hot DA white dwarf G191-B2B. Models\nincluding {\\sc autostructure} PICS were found to change the abundances of N and\nO by as much as $\\sim 22$\\% compared to models using hydrogenic PICS, but\nheavier species were relatively unaffected. Models including {\\sc\nautostructure} PICS caused the abundances of N/O {\\sc iv} and {\\sc v} to\ndiverge. This is because the increased opacity in the {\\sc autostructure} PICS\nmodel causes these charge states to form higher in the atmosphere, moreso for\nN/O {\\sc v}. Models using an extended line list caused significant changes to\nthe Ni {\\sc iv}-{\\sc v} abundances. While both PICS and an extended line list\ncause changes in both synthetic spectra and measured abundances, the biggest\nchanges are caused by using {\\sc autostructure} PICS for Ni.\n", "  DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) is a Stage IV ground-based dark\nenergy experiment that will study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the\ngrowth of structure through redshift-space distortions with a wide-area galaxy\nand quasar redshift survey. To trace the underlying dark matter distribution,\nspectroscopic targets will be selected in four classes from imaging data. We\nwill measure luminous red galaxies up to $z=1.0$. To probe the Universe out to\neven higher redshift, DESI will target bright [O II] emission line galaxies up\nto $z=1.7$. Quasars will be targeted both as direct tracers of the underlying\ndark matter distribution and, at higher redshifts ($ 2.1 < z < 3.5$), for the\nLy-$\\alpha$ forest absorption features in their spectra, which will be used to\ntrace the distribution of neutral hydrogen. When moonlight prevents efficient\nobservations of the faint targets of the baseline survey, DESI will conduct a\nmagnitude-limited Bright Galaxy Survey comprising approximately 10 million\ngalaxies with a median $z\\approx 0.2$. In total, more than 30 million galaxy\nand quasar redshifts will be obtained to measure the BAO feature and determine\nthe matter power spectrum, including redshift space distortions.\n", "  DESI (Dark Energy Spectropic Instrument) is a Stage IV ground-based dark\nenergy experiment that will study baryon acoustic oscillations and the growth\nof structure through redshift-space distortions with a wide-area galaxy and\nquasar redshift survey. The DESI instrument is a robotically-actuated,\nfiber-fed spectrograph capable of taking up to 5,000 simultaneous spectra over\na wavelength range from 360 nm to 980 nm. The fibers feed ten three-arm\nspectrographs with resolution $R= \\lambda/\\Delta\\lambda$ between 2000 and 5500,\ndepending on wavelength. The DESI instrument will be used to conduct a\nfive-year survey designed to cover 14,000 deg$^2$. This powerful instrument\nwill be installed at prime focus on the 4-m Mayall telescope in Kitt Peak,\nArizona, along with a new optical corrector, which will provide a three-degree\ndiameter field of view. The DESI collaboration will also deliver a\nspectroscopic pipeline and data management system to reduce and archive all\ndata for eventual public use.\n", "  As part of an ALMA survey to study the origin of episodic accretion in young\neruptive variables, we have observed the circumstellar environment of the star\nV2775 Ori. This object is a very young, pre-main sequence object which displays\na large amplitude outburst characteristic of the FUor class. We present Cycle-2\nband 6 observations of V2775 Ori with a continuum and CO (2-1) isotopologue\nresolution of 0.25\\as (103 au). We report the detection of a marginally\nresolved circumstellar disc in the ALMA continuum with an integrated flux of\n$106 \\pm 2$ mJy, characteristic radius of $\\sim$ 30 au, inclination of\n$14.0^{+7.8}_{-14.5}$ deg, and is oriented nearly face-on with respect to the\nplane of the sky.\n  The \\co~emission is separated into distinct blue and red-shifted regions that\nappear to be rings or shells of expanding material from quasi-episodic\noutbursts. The system is oriented in such a way that the disc is seen through\nthe outflow remnant of V2775 Ori, which has an axis along our line-of-sight.\nThe $^{13}$CO emission displays similar structure to that of the \\co, while the\nC$^{18}$O line emission is very weak. We calculated the expansion velocities of\nthe low- and medium-density material with respect to the disc to be of -2.85 km\ns$^{-1}$ (blue), 4.4 km s$^{-1}$ (red) and -1.35 and 1.15 km s$^{-1}$ (for blue\nand red) and we derived the mass, momentum and kinetic energy of the expanding\ngas. The outflow has an hourglass shape where the cavities are not seen. We\ninterpret the shapes that the gas traces as cavities excavated by an ancient\noutflow. We report a detection of line emission from the circumstellar disc and\nderive a lower limit of the gas mass of 3 \\MJup.\n", "  We have made measurements to determine the parallax and proper motion of the\nthree 6.7-GHz methanol masers G305.200$+$0.019, G305.202$+$0.208 and\nG305.208$+$0.206. The combined parallax is found to be 0.25$\\pm $0.05 mas,\ncorresponding to a distance of 4.1$^{+1.2}_{-0.7}$ kpc. This places the G305.2\nstar formation region in the Carina-Sagittarius spiral arm. The inclusion of\nG305.2 increases the Galactic azimuth range of the sources in this arm by\n40$^\\circ $ from Sato et al., allowing us to determine the pitch angle of this\nspiral with greater confidence to be $\\psi = 19.0 \\pm 2.6^\\circ $. The first\nVLBI spot maps of the 6.7-GHz methanol masers towards these sources show that\nthey have simple linear and ring-like structures, consistent with emission\nexpected from classII methanol masers in general.\n", "  Using the Oxford Short Wavelength Integral Field specTrograph (SWIFT), we\ntrace radial variations of initial mass function (IMF) sensitive absorption\nfeatures of three galaxies in the Coma cluster. We obtain resolved spectroscopy\nof the central 5kpc for the two central brightest-cluster galaxies (BCGs)\nNGC4889, NGC4874, and the BCG in the south-west group NGC4839, as well as\nunresolved data for NGC4873 as a low-$\\sigma_*$ control. We present radial\nmeasurements of the IMF-sensitive features sodium NaI$_{\\rm{SDSS}}$, calcium\ntriplet CaT and iron-hydride FeH0.99, along with the magnesium MgI0.88 and\ntitanium oxide TiO0.89 features. We employ two separate methods for both\ntelluric correction and sky-subtraction around the faint FeH feature to verify\nour analysis. Within NGC4889 we find strong gradients of NaI$_{\\rm{SDSS}}$ and\nCaT but a flat FeH profile, which from comparing to stellar population\nsynthesis models, suggests an old, $\\alpha$-enhanced population with a\nChabrier, or even bottom-light IMF. The age and abundance is in line with\nprevious studies but the normal IMF is in contrast to recent results suggesting\nan increased IMF slope with increased velocity dispersion. We measure flat\nNaI$_{\\rm{SDSS}}$ and FeH profiles within NGC4874 and determine an old,\npossibly slightly $\\alpha$-enhanced and Chabrier IMF population. We find an\n$\\alpha$-enhanced, Chabrier IMF population in NGC4873. Within NGC4839 we\nmeasure both strong NaI$_{\\rm{SDSS}}$ and strong FeH, although with a large\nsystematic uncertainty, suggesting a possible heavier IMF. The IMFs we infer\nfor these galaxies are supported by published dynamical modelling. We stress\nthat IMF constraints should be corroborated by further spectral coverage and\nindependent methods on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis.\n", "  We explore the variation in single star 15-30 $\\rm{M}_{\\odot}$, non-rotating,\nsolar metallicity, pre-supernova MESA models due to changes in the number of\nisotopes in a fully-coupled nuclear reaction network and adjustments in the\nmass resolution. Within this two-dimensional plane we quantitatively detail the\nrange of core masses at various stages of evolution, mass locations of the main\nnuclear burning shells, electron fraction profiles, mass fraction profiles,\nburning lifetimes, stellar lifetimes, and compactness parameter at\ncore-collapse for models with and without mass loss. Up to carbon burning we\ngenerally find mass resolution has a larger impact on the variations than the\nnumber of isotopes, while the number of isotopes plays a more significant role\nin determining the span of the variations for neon, oxygen and silicon burning.\nChoice of mass resolution dominates the variations in the structure of the\nintermediate convection zone and secondary convection zone during core and\nshell hydrogen burning respectively, where we find a minimum mass resolution of\n$\\approx$ 0.01 $\\rm{M}_{\\odot}$ is necessary to achieve convergence in the\nhelium core mass at the $\\approx$5% level. On the other hand, at the onset of\ncore-collapse we find $\\approx$30% variations in the central electron fraction\nand mass locations of the main nuclear burning shells, a minimum of\n$\\approx$127 isotopes is needed to attain convergence of these values at the\n$\\approx$10% level.\n", "  We report the results of optical--infrared follow-up observations of the\ngravitational wave (GW) event GW151226 detected by the Advanced LIGO in the\nframework of J-GEM (Japanese collaboration for Gravitational wave\nElectroMagnetic follow-up). We performed wide-field optical imaging surveys\nwith Kiso Wide Field Camera (KWFC), Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), and MOA-cam3. The\nKWFC survey started at 2.26 days after the GW event and covered 778 deg$^2$\ncentered at the high Galactic region of the skymap of GW151226. We started the\nHSC follow-up observations from 12 days after the event and covered an area of\n63.5 deg$^2$ of the highest probability region of the northern sky with the\nlimiting magnitudes of 24.6 and 23.8 for i band and z band, respectively.\nMOA-cam3 covered 145 deg$^2$ of the skymap with MOA-red filter 2.5 months after\nthe GW alert. Total area covered by the wide-field surveys was 986.5 deg$^2$.\nThe integrated detection probability of all the observed area was $\\sim$29%. We\nalso performed galaxy-targeted observations with six optical and near-infrared\ntelescopes from 1.61 days after the event. Total of 238 nearby (<100 Mpc)\ngalaxies were observed with the typical I band limiting magnitude of\n$\\sim$19.5. We detected 13 supernova candidates with the KWFC survey, and 60\nextragalactic transients with the HSC survey. Two third of the HSC transients\nwere likely supernovae and the remaining one third were possible active\ngalactic nuclei. With our observational campaign, we found no transients that\nare likely to be associated with GW151226.\n", "  We simulate several magnetic reconnection processes in the low solar\nchromosphere/photosphere, the radiation cooling, heat conduction and ambipolar\ndiffusion are all included. Our numerical results indicate that both the high\ntemperature($ \\gtrsim 8\\times10^4$~K) and low temperature($\\sim 10^4$~K)\nmagnetic reconnection events can happen in the low solar atmosphere\n($100\\sim600$~km above the solar surface). The plasma $\\beta$ controlled by\nplasma density and magnetic fields is one important factor to decide how much\nthe plasma can be heated up. The low temperature event is formed in a high\n$\\beta$ magnetic reconnection process, Joule heating is the main mechanism to\nheat plasma and the maximum temperature increase is only several thousand\nKelvin. The high temperature explosions can be generated in a low $\\beta$\nmagnetic reconnection process, slow and fast-mode shocks attached at the edges\nof the well developed plasmoids are the main physical mechanisms to heat the\nplasma from several thousand Kelvin to over $8\\times10^4$~K. Gravity in the low\nchromosphere can strongly hinder the plasmoind instability and the formation of\nslow-mode shocks in a vertical current sheet. Only small secondary islands are\nformed; these islands, however, are not well developed as those in the\nhorizontal current sheets. This work can be applied for understanding the\nheating mechanism in the low solar atmosphere and could possibly be extended to\nexplain the formation of common low temperature EBs ($\\sim10^4$~K) and the high\ntenperature IRIS bombs ($\\gtrsim 8\\times10^4$) in the future.\n", "  Forbidden neon emission from jets of low-mass young stars can be used to\nprobe the underlying high-energy processes in these systems. We analyze spectra\nof the jet of DG Tau obtained with the Very Large Telescope/X-Shooter\nspectrograph in 2010. [Ne III] $\\lambda$3869 is clearly detected in the\ninnermost 3\" microjet and the outer knot located at $\\sim$6\".5. The velocity\nstructure of the inner microjet can be decomposed into the low-velocity\ncomponent (LVC) at $\\sim -70$ km/s and the high-velocity component (HVC) at\n$\\sim -180$ km/s. Based on the observed [Ne III] flux and its spatial extent,\nwe suggest the origins of the [Ne III] emission regions and their relation with\nknown X-ray sources along the jet. The flares from the hard X-ray source close\nto the star may be the main ionization source of the innermost microjet. The\nfainter soft X-ray source at 0\".2 from the star may provide sufficient heating\nto help to sustain the ionization fraction against the recombination in the\nflow. The outer knot may be reionized by shocks faster than 100 km/s such that\n[Ne III] emission reappears and that the soft X-ray emission at 5\".5 is\nproduced. Velocity decomposition of the archival Hubble Space Telescope spectra\nobtained in 1999 shows that the HVC had been faster, with a velocity centroid\nof $\\sim -260$ km/s. Such a decrease in velocity may potentially be explained\nby the expansion of the stellar magnetosphere, changing the truncation radius\nand thus the launching speed of the jet. The energy released by magnetic\nreconnections during relaxation of the transition can heat the gas up to\nseveral tens of megakelvin and provide the explanation for on-source keV X-ray\nflares that ionize the neon microjet.\n", "  Development of chip-scale optical frequency comb with the coverage from\nultra-violet (UV) to mid-infrared (MIR) wavelength is of great significance. To\nexpand the comb spectrum into the challenging UV region, a material platform\nwith high UV transparency is crucial. In this paper, crystalline aluminum\nnitride (AlN)-onsapphire film is demonstrated for efficient Kerr frequency comb\ngeneration. Near-infrared (NIR) comb with nearly octave-spanning coverage and\nlow parametric threshold is achieved in continuous-wave pumped\nhigh-quality-factor AlN microring resonators. The competition between\nstimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and hyperparametric oscillation is\ninvestigated, along with broadband comb generation via Raman-assisted four-wave\nmixing (FWM). Thanks to its wide bandgap, excellent crystalline quality as well\nas intrinsic quadratic and cubic susceptibilities, AlN-on-sapphire platform\nshould be appealing for integrated nonlinear optics from MIR to UV region.\n", "  We search for indications of waves in the 25-2000 MHz radio spectrum of the 1\nAugust 2010 event (SOL2010-08-01T08:57:00L075C013), where fast propagating\nwaves in the solar corona with the periods of 181, 69, and 40 seconds were\ndetected in UV observations. Using the wavelet technique we construct a new\ntype of map of oscillations for selected periods in the whole domain of the\nradio spectrum. While the oscillation with the period of 181 seconds was\nrecognized in the whole 25-2000 MHz radio spectrum, oscillations with periods\nof 69 and 40 seconds were confirmed only in the 250-870 MHz frequency range. In\nthe 800-2000 MHz range we found periods of 50 and 80 seconds. Moreover, in the\n250-870 MHz frequency range, the oscillation with the period of about 420\nseconds was detected. We also made maps of phases of the 181-second\noscillations in order to analyze their frequency drift. At the beginning of the\nradio event, in the 2000-500 MHz frequency range the phase of the 181-second\noscillation drifts towards lower frequencies. On the other hand, at frequencies\n25-500 MHz we found that the phase is nearly synchronous. While the phase drift\nat higher frequencies can be interpreted as being caused by the UV wave, the\nsynchronization of the phase on lower frequencies is explained by the\nfast-electron beams, whose acceleration is modulated by the UV wave. Owing to\nthis modulation, the electron beams are accelerated with the period of the UV\nwave (181 seconds). These beams propagate upwards through the solar corona and\ngenerate the 25-500 MHz radio emission with the 181-second period. Due to high\nbeam velocity (~c/3, where c is the light speed) the 25-500 MHz radio emission,\ncorresponding to a large interval of heights in the solar corona, is nearly\nsynchronous.\n", "  We present and discuss radial velocity and the very first metallicity\nmeasurements for nine evolved stars in the poorly known old open cluster NGC\n7762. We isolated eight radial velocity cluster members and one interloper.\nRadial velocities are in good agreement with previous studies. NGC 7762 turns\nout to be of solar metallicity within the uncertainties ([Fe/H]=0.04$\\pm$0.12).\nFor this metallicity, the cluster age is 2.5$\\pm$0.2 Gyr, and falls in a age\nrange where only a few old open clusters are known. With respect to previous\nstudies, we find a larger distance, implying the cluster to be located at\n900$^{+70}_{-50}$ pc from the Sun. For most of the elements we measure\nsolar-scaled abundance ratios. We searched the literature for open clusters of\nsimilar age in the solar vicinity and found that NGC 7762 can be considered a\ntwin of Ruprecht 147, a similar age cluster located at only 300 pc from the\nSun. In fact, beside age, also metallicity and abundance ratios are very close\nto Ruprecht 147 values within the observational uncertainties.\n", "  We created a large database of physical parameters and variability indicators\nby fully reducing and analysing the large number of spectra taken to complement\nthe asteroseismic observations of the CoRoT satellite. 7103 spectra of 261\nstars obtained with the ESO echelle spectrograph HARPS have been stored in the\nVO-compliant database Spectroscopic Indicators in a SeisMic Archive (SISMA),\nalong with the CoRoT photometric data of the 72 CoRoT asteroseismic targets.\nThe remaining stars belong to the same variable classes of the CoRoT targets\nand were observed to better characterize the properties of such classes.\nSeveral useful variability indicators (mean line profiles; indices of\ndifferential rotation, activity and emission lines) together with vsini and\nradial velocity measurements have been extracted from the spectra. The\natmospheric parameters Teff, logg and [Fe/H] have been computed following a\nhomogeneous procedure. As a result, we fully characterize a sample of new and\nknown variable stars by computing several spectroscopic indicators, also\nproviding some cases of simultaneous photometry and spectroscopy.\n", "  We present a theoretical study of the ultrafast electron dynamics in\ntransition metals using ultrashort pulsed laser beams. The significant\ninfluence of the contribution of the dynamics of produced nonthermal electrons\nto electron thermalisation and electron-phonon interaction is thoroughly\ninvestigated within a range of values of the pulse duration (i.e. from 10fs to\n2.3ps). The theoretical model elaborates firstly on possible transient changes\nof optical parameters during irradiation due to the presence of the\nnon-equilibrium electrons and the modification of the electron distribution\nfunction in a material characterized by a variable electron density of states\naround the Fermi energy. The model correlates the role of nonthermal electrons,\nrelaxation processes and induced stress-strain fields. Simulations are\npresented by choosing Nickel (Ni) as a test material to compute electron-phonon\nrelaxation time due to its large electron-phonon coupling constant that expects\nto reveal more conclusively the influence of the non-equilibrium electrons. We\ndemonstrate the consideration of the above factors leads to significant changes\ncompared to the results the traditional Two Temperature Model (TTM) provides.\nThe proposed model predicts a substantially (~33%) smaller damage threshold and\na large increase of the stress (~20%, at early times) which firstly underlines\nthe role of the nonthermal electron interactions and secondly enhances its\nimportance with respect to the precise determination of laser specifications in\nmaterial micromachining techniques.\n", "  We have studied a representative sample of intermediate-mass galaxies at z~1,\nobserved by the kinematic survey KMOS3D. We have re-estimated the kinematical\nparameters from the published kinematic maps and analysed photometric data from\nHST to measure optical disk inclinations and PAs. We find that only half of the\nz~1 galaxies show kinematic properties consistent with rotating disks, using\nthe same classification scheme than that adopted by the KMOS3D team. Because\nmerger orbital motions can also brought rotation, we have also analysed galaxy\nmorphologies from the available HST imagery. Combining these results to those\nfrom kinematics, it leads to a full morpho-kinematic classification. To test\nthe robustness of the latter for disentangling isolated disks from mergers, we\nconfronted the results with an analysis of pairs from the open-grism redshift\nsurvey 3D-HST. All galaxies found in pairs are affected by either kinematic\nand/or morphological perturbations. Conversely, all galaxies classified as\nvirialized spirals are found to be isolated. A significant fraction (one\nfourth) of rotating disks classified from kinematics by the KMOS3D team are\nfound in pairs, which further supports the need for a morpho-kinematic\nclassification. It results that only one third of z~1 galaxies are isolated and\nvirialized spirals, while 58% of them are likely involved in a merger sequence,\nfrom first approach to disk rebuilding. The later fraction is in good agreement\nwith the results of semi-empirical {\\Lambda}CDM models, supporting a\nmerger-dominated hierarchical scenario as being the main driver of galaxy\nformation at least during the last 8 billion years.\n", "  The late evolutionary stages of stellar evolution are a key ingredient for\nour understanding in many fields of astrophysics, including stellar evolution\nand the enrichment of the interstellar medium (ISM) via stellar yields. Already\nthe first interferometric campaigns identified evolved stars as the primary\ntargets because of their extended and partially optically thin atmospheres, and\nthe brightness in the infrared. Interferometric studies spanning different\nwavelength ranges, from visual to mid-infrared, have greatly increased our\nknowledge of the complex atmospheres of these objects where different dynamic\nprocesses are at play. In less than two decades this technique went from\nmeasuring simple diameters to produce the first images of stellar surfaces. By\nscanning the extended atmospheres we constrained theoretical models, learnt\nabout molecular stratification, dust formation, and stellar winds, and there is\nstill a lot to be done. In this contribution I will review the recent results\nthat optical/infrared interferometry has made on our current understanding of\ncool evolved stars. The presentation will focus on asymptotic giant branch\nstars, and red supergiants. I will discuss the challenges of image\nreconstruction, and highlight how this field of research will benefit from the\nsynergy of the current interferometric instrument(s) with the second generation\nVLTI facilities GRAVITY and MATISSE. Finally I will conclude with a short\nintrospection on applications of a visible interferometer and of the the Planet\nFormation Imager (PFI) to the field of evolved stars.\n", "  The origin of spin of low-mass supermassive black hole (SMBH) is still a\npuzzle at present. We here report a study on the host galaxies of a sample of\nradio-selected nearby ($z<0.05$) Seyfert 2 galaxies with a BH mass of $10^{6-7}\nM_\\odot$. By modeling the SDSS $r$-band images of these galaxies through a\n2-dimensional bulge+disk decomposition, we identify a new dependence of SMBH's\nradio power on host bulge surface brightness profile, in which more powerful\nradio emission comes from a SMBH associated with a more disk-like bulge. This\nresult means low-mass and high-mass SMBHs are spun up by two entirely different\nmodes that correspond to two different evolutionary paths. A low-mass SMBH is\nspun up by a gas accretion with significant disk-like rotational dynamics of\nthe host galaxy in the secular evolution, while a high-mass one by a BH-BH\nmerger in the merger evolution.\n", "  We report Venus image observations around the two maximum elongations of the\nplanet at June and October 2015. From these images we describe the global\natmospheric dynamics and cloud morphology in the planet before the arrival of\nJAXA Akatsuki mission on December the 7th. The majority of the images were\nacquired at ultraviolet wavelengths (380-410 nm) using small telescopes. The\nVenus dayside was also observed with narrow band filters at other wavelengths\n(890 nm, 725-950 nm, 1.435 {\\mu}m CO2 band) using the instrument\nPlanetCam-UPV/EHU at the 2.2m telescope in Calar Alto Observatory. In all\ncases, the lucky imaging methodology was used to improve the spatial resolution\nof the images over the atmospheric seeing. During the April-June period, the\nmorphology of the upper cloud showed an irregular and chaotic texture with a\nwell developed equatorial dark belt (afternoon hemisphere), whereas during\nOctober-December the dynamical regime was dominated by planetary-scale waves\n(Yhorizontal, C-reversed and {\\psi}-horizontal features) formed by long\nstreaks, and banding suggesting more stable conditions. Measurements of the\nzonal wind velocity with cloud tracking in the latitude range from\n50$^{\\circ}$N to 50$^{\\circ}$S shows agreement with retrievals from previous\nworks.\n", "  We review electrodynamics of rotating magnetized neutron stars, from the\nearly vacuum model to recent numerical experiments with plasma-filled\nmagnetospheres. Significant progress became possible due to the development of\nglobal particle-in-cell simulations which capture particle acceleration,\nemission of high-energy photons, and electron-positron pair creation. The\nnumerical experiments show from first principles how and where electric gaps\nform, and promise to explain the observed pulsar activity from radio waves to\ngamma-rays.\n", "  Shear flows are naturally expected to occur in astrophysical environments and\npotential sites of continuous non-thermal Fermi-type particle acceleration.\nHere we investigate the efficiency of expanding relativistic outflows to\nfacilitate the acceleration of energetic charged particles to higher energies.\nTo this end, the gradual shear acceleration coefficient is derived based on an\nanalytical treatment. The results are applied to the context of the\nrelativistic jets of active galactic nuclei. The inferred acceleration\ntimescale is investigated for a variety of conical flow profiles (i.e., power\nlaw, Gaussian, Fermi-Dirac) and compared to the relevant radiative and\nnon-radiative loss timescales. The results exemplify that relativistic shear\nflows are capable of boosting cosmic-rays to extreme energies. Efficient\nelectron acceleration, on the other hand, requires weak magnetic fields and may\nthus be accompanied by a delayed onset of particle energization and affect the\noverall jet appearance (e.g., core, ridge line and limb-brightening).\n", "  We report the discovery of a potentially major supercluster that extends\nacross the Galactic Plane in the constellation of Vela, at a mean recessional\nvelocity of ~18,000 km/s. Recent multi-object spectroscopic observations of\nthis Vela Supercluster (VSCL), using AAOmega+2dF and the Southern African Large\nTelescope, confirm an extended galaxy overdensity in the Zone of Avoidance\n(ZOA) located where residual bulk flows predict a considerable mass excess. We\npresent a preliminary analysis of ~4,500 new spectroscopic galaxy redshifts\nobtained in the ZOA centred on the Vela region (l=272.5+-20 deg, b=0+-10 deg).\nThe presently sparsely-sampled dataset traces an overdensity that covers 25 deg\nin Galactic longitude on either side of the Plane, suggesting an extent of 25\ndeg x 20 deg, corresponding to ~115 x 90 $h_{70}$ Mpc at the supercluster\nredshift. In redshift space, the overdensity appears to consist of two merging\nwall-like structures, interspersed with clusters and groups. Both the velocity\nhistogram and the morphology of the multi-branching wall structure are\nconsistent with a supercluster classification. $K_s^o$ galaxy counts show an\nenhancement of ~1.2 over the survey area for galaxies brighter than $M_K^*$ at\nthe VSCL distance, and a galaxy overdensity of $\\delta=0.50\\rm{-}0.77$ within a\nphotometric redshift shell around the VSCL, when compared to various Two-Micron\nAll-Sky Survey samples. Taking account of selection effects, the VSCL is\nestimated to contribute $v_\\rm{LG} \\gtrsim 50$ km/s to the motion of the Local\nGroup.\n", "  Spatial coexistence of coherent and incoherent dynamics in network of coupled\noscillators is called a chimera state. We study such chimera states in a\nnetwork of neurons without any direct interactions but connected through\nanother medium of neurons, forming a multilayer structure. The upper layer is\nthus made up of uncoupled neurons and the lower layer plays the role of a\nmedium through which the neurons in the upper layer share information among\neach other. Hindmarsh-Rose neurons with square wave bursting dynamics are\nconsidered as nodes in both layers. In addition, we also discuss the existence\nof chimera states in presence of inter layer heterogeneity. The neurons in the\nbottom layer are globally connected through electrical synapses, while across\nthe two layers chemical synapses are formed. According to our research, the\ncompeting effects of these two types of synapses can lead to chimera states in\nthe upper layer of uncoupled neurons. Remarkably, we find a density-dependent\nthreshold for the emergence of chimera states in uncoupled neurons, similar to\nthe quorum sensing transition to a synchronized state. Finally, we examine the\nimpact of both homogeneous and heterogeneous inter-layer information\ntransmission delays on the observed chimera states over a wide parameter space.\n", "  Global, population-wide oscillations in models of cyclic dominance may result\nin the collapse of biodiversity due to the accidental extinction of one species\nin the loop. Previous research has shown that such oscillations can emerge if\nthe interaction network has small-world properties, and more generally, because\nof long-range interactions among individuals or because of mobility. But\nalthough these features are all common in nature, global oscillations are\nrarely observed in actual biological systems. This begets the question what is\nthe missing ingredient that would prevent local oscillations to synchronize\nacross the population to form global oscillations. Here we show that, although\nheterogeneous species-specific invasion rates fail to have a noticeable impact\non species coexistence, randomness in site-specific invasion rates successfully\nhinders the emergence of global oscillations and thus preserves biodiversity.\nOur model takes into account that the environment is often not uniform but\nrather spatially heterogeneous, which may influence the success of microscopic\ndynamics locally. This prevents the synchronization of locally emerging\noscillations, and ultimately results in a phenomenon where one type of\nrandomness is used to mitigate the adverse effects of other types of randomness\nin the system.\n", "  In order to discuss the potential impact of solar 'superflares' on space\nweather, we investigated statistical relations among energetic proton peak flux\nwith energy higher than $ 10 \\rm MeV$ ($F_p$), CME speed near the Sun\n($V_{CME}$) obtained by {\\it SOHO}/LASCO coronagraph and flare soft X-ray peak\nflux in 1-8\\AA band ($F_{SXR}$) during 110 major solar proton events (SPEs)\nrecorded from 1996 to 2014. The linear regression fit results in the scaling\nrelations $V_{CME} \\propto F_{SXR}^\\alpha$, $F_p\\propto F_{SXR}^\\beta$ and\n$F_p\\propto V_{CME}^\\gamma$ with $\\alpha = 0.30\\pm 0.04$, $\\beta = 1.19 \\pm\n0.08$ and $\\gamma = 4.35 \\pm 0.50$, respectively. On the basis of simple\nphysical assumptions, on the other hand, we derive scaling relations expressing\nCME mass ($M_{CME}$), CME speed and energetic proton flux in terms of total\nflare energy ($E_{flare}$) as, $M_{CME}\\propto E_{flare}^{2/3}$,\n$V_{CME}\\propto E_{flare}^{1/6}$ and $F_{p}\\propto E_{flare}^{5/6}\\propto\nV_{CME}^5$, respectively. We then combine the derived scaling relations with\nobservation, and estimated the upper limit of $V_{CME}$ and $F_p$ to be\nassociated with possible solar superflares.\n", "  The formation pathways of different types of organic molecules in\nprotostellar envelopes and other regions of star formation are subjects of\nintense current interest. We here present observations of C$_4$H and CH$_3$OH,\ntracing two distinct groups of interstellar organic molecules, toward 16\nprotostars in the Ophiuchus and Corona Australis molecular clouds. Together\nwith observations in the literature, we present C$_4$H and CH$_3$OH data from\nsingle-dish observations of 40 embedded protostars. We find no correlation\nbetween the C$_4$H and CH$_3$OH column densities in this large sample. Based on\nthis lack of correlation, a difference in line profiles between C$_4$H and\nCH$_3$OH, and previous interferometric observations of similar sources, we\npropose that the emission from these two molecules is spatially separated, with\nthe CH$_3$OH tracing gas that has been transiently heated to high ($\\sim$70-100\nK) temperatures, and the C$_4$H tracing the cooler large-scale envelope where\nCH$_4$ molecules have been liberated from ices. These results provide insight\nin the differentiation between hot corino and warm carbon-chain chemistry in\nembedded protostars.\n", "  It is believed that the hard X-ray emission in the luminous active galactic\nnuclei (AGNs) is from the hot corona above the cool accretion disk. However,\nthe formation of the corona is still debated. Liu et al. investigated the\nspectrum of the corona heated by the reconnection of the magnetic field\ngenerated by dynamo action in the thin disk and emerging into the corona as a\nresult of buoyancy instability. In the present paper, we improve this model to\ninterpret the observed relation of the hard X-ray spectrum becoming softer at\nhigher accretion rate in luminous AGNs. The magnetic field is characterized by\n$\\beta_{\\rm 0}$, i.e., the ratio of the sum of gas pressure and radiation\npressure to magnetic pressure in the disk ($\\beta_{\\rm 0}=(P_{\\rm g,d}+P_{\\rm\nr,d})/P_{\\rm B}$). Besides, both the intrinsic disk photons and reprocessed\nphotons by the disk are included as the seed photons for inverse Compton\nscattering. These improvements are crucial for investigating the effect of\nmagnetic field on the accretion disk-corona when it is not clear whether the\nradiation pressure or gas pressure dominates in thin disk. We change the value\nof $\\beta_{\\rm 0}$ in order to constrain the magnetic field in the accretion\ndisk. We find that the energy fraction released in the corona ($f$) gradually\nincreases with the decrease of $\\beta_{\\rm 0}$ for the same accretion rate.\nWhen $\\beta_{\\rm 0}$ decreases to less than 50, the structure and spectrum of\nthe disk-corona is independent on accretion rate, which is similar to the hard\nspectrum found in Liu et al.(2003). Comparing with the observational results of\nthe hard X-ray bolometric correction factor in a sample of luminous AGNs, we\nsuggest that the value of $\\beta_{\\rm 0}$ is about 100-200 for $\\alpha=0.3$ and\nthe energy fraction $f$ should be larger than $30\\%$ for hard X-ray emission.\n", "  GIARPS (GIAno & haRPS) is a project devoted to have on the same focal station\nof the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) both the high resolution\nspectrographs HARPS-N (VIS) and GIANO (NIR) working simultaneously. This could\nbe considered the first and unique worldwide instrument providing\ncross-dispersed echelle spectroscopy at a high resolution (R=115,000 in the\nvisual and R=50,000 in the IR) and over in a wide spectral range (0.383 - 2.45\nmicron) in a single exposure. The science case is very broad, given the\nversatility of such an instrument and the large wavelength range. A number of\noutstanding science cases encompassing mainly extra-solar planet science\nstarting from rocky planet search and hot Jupiters, atmosphere characterization\ncan be considered. Furthermore both instrument can measure high precision\nradial velocity by means the simultaneous thorium technique (HARPS - N) and\nabsorbing cell technique (GIANO) in a single exposure. Other science cases are\nalso possible. Young stars and proto-planetary disks, cool stars and stellar\npopulations, moving minor bodies in the solar system, bursting young stellar\nobjects, cataclysmic variables and X-ray binary transients in our Galaxy,\nsupernovae up to gamma-ray bursts in the very distant and young Universe, can\ntake advantage of the unicity of this facility both in terms of contemporaneous\nwide wavelength range and high resolution spectroscopy.\n", "  Analysis of the observations of the SOL2001-12-26 event related to\nground-level-event GLE63, including microwave spectra and images from NoRH at\n17 and 34 GHz, SSRT at 5.7 GHz, and TRACE in 1600 \\AA\\ has led to the following\nresults. A flare ribbon overlapped with the sunspot umbra, which is typical of\nlarge particle events. Atypical were: i) long duration of the flare of more\nthan one hour; ii) moderate intensity of a microwave burst, about $10^4$ sfu;\niii) low peak frequency of the gyrosynchrotron spectrum, around 6 GHz; and its\ninsensitivity to the flux increase by more than one order of magnitude. This\nwas accompanied by a nearly constant ratio of the flux emitted by the volume in\nthe high-frequency part of the spectrum to its elevated low-frequency part\ndetermined by the area of the source. With the self-similarity of the spectrum,\na similarity was observed between the moving microwave sources and the\nbrightest parts of the flare ribbons in 1600 \\AA. Comparison of the 17 GHz and\n1600 \\AA\\ images has confirmed that the microwave sources were associated with\nmultiple flare loops, whose footpoints appeared in ultraviolet as intermittent\nbright kernels. To understand the properties of the event, we simulated its\nmicrowave emission using a system of several homogeneous gyrosynchrotron\nsources above the ribbons. The scatter between the spectra and sizes of the\nindividual sources is determined by the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field\nwithin the ribbons. The microwave flux is mainly governed by the magnetic flux\npassing through the ribbons and the sources. An apparent simplicity of\nmicrowave structures is caused by a poorer spatial resolution and dynamic range\nof the microwave imaging. The results indicate that microwave manifestations of\naccelerated electrons correspond to the structures observed in thermal\nemissions, as well-known models predict.\n", "  The correlation between the jet power and accretion disk luminosity is\ninvestigated and analyzed with our model for 7 samples of low luminosity active\ngalactic nuclei (LLAGNs). The main results are: (1) the power-law correlation\nindex ($P_{jet} \\propto L_{disk}^{\\mu}$) typically ranges $\\mu=0.4-0.7$ for the\nLLAGN samples, and there is a hint of steep index for the LLAGN sample which\nhosted by a high fraction of elliptical galaxies, and there are no significant\ncorrelation between the $\\mu$ and the LLAGN types (Seyfert, LINER); (2) for\n$\\mu \\approx$1, as noted in Liu et al., the accretion disk dominates the jet\npower and the black hole (BH) spin is not important, for the LLAGN samples\nstudied in this paper we find that the $\\mu$ is significantly less than unity,\nimplying that BH spin may play a significant role in the jet power of LLAGNs;\n(3) the BH spin-jet power is negatively correlated with the BH mass in our\nmodel, which means a high spin-jet efficiency in the `low' BH-mass LLAGNs; (4)\nan anti-correlation between radio loudness and disk luminosity is found, which\nis apparently due to the flatter power-law index in the jet-disk correlation of\nthe LLAGNs, and the radio loudness can be higher in the LLAGNs than in luminous\nAGNs/quasars when the BH spin-jet power is comparable to or dominate over the\naccretion-jet power in the LLAGNs. The high radio-core dominance of the LLAGNs\nis also discussed.\n", "  In VO$_2$, the explicit origin of the insulator-to-metal transition is still\ndisputable between Peierls and Mott insulators. Along with the controversy, its\nsecond monoclinic (M2) phase has received considerable attention due to the\npresence of electron correlation in undimerized vanadium ions. However, the\norigin of the M2 phase is still obscure. Here, we study a granular VO$_2$ film\nusing conductive atomic force microscopy and Raman scattering. Upon the\nstructural transition from monoclinic to rutile, we observe directly an\nintermediate state showing the coexistence of monoclinic M1 and M2 phases. The\nconductivity near the grain boundary in this regime is six times larger than\nthat of the grain core, producing a donut-like landscape. Our results reveal an\nintra-grain percolation process, indicating that VO$_2$ with the M2 phase is a\nMott insulator.\n", "  The dispersionless longitudinal photon in Maxwell theory is thought of as a\nredundant degree of freedom due to the gauge symmetry. We find that when there\nexist exactly flat bands with zero energy in a condensed matter system, the\nfermion field may locally transform as a gauge field and the system possesses a\ngauge symmetry. As the longitudinal photon, the redundant degrees of freedom\nfrom the flat bands must be gauged away from the physical states. As an\nexample, we study spinless fermions on a generalized Lieb lattice in three\ndimensions. The flat band of the longitudinal fermion induces a gauge symmetry.\nAn external magnetic field breaks this gauge symmetry and emerges a bunch of\nnon-topologically chiral modes. Combining these emergent chiral modes with the\nchiral anomaly mode which is of an opposite chirality, rich anomalous electric\ntransport phenomena exhibit and are expected to be observed in\nPd$_3$Bi$_2$S$_2$ and Ag$_3$Se$_2$Au.\n", "  Class I methanol masers are collisionally pumped and are generally correlated\nwith outflows in star forming sites in the Galaxy. Using the VLA in its A-array\nconfiguration, we present a spectral line survey to identify methanol\n$J=4_{-1}\\rightarrow3_0E$ emission at 36.169~GHz. Over 900 pointings were used\nto cover a region 66'x13'along the inner Galactic plane. A shallow survey of OH\nat 1612, 1665, 1667 and 1720 MHz was also carried out over the area covered by\nour methanol survey. We provide a catalog of 2240 methanol masers with narrow\nline-widths of $\\sim1$ km s$^{-1}$, spatial resolution of ~0.14\"x0.05\" and RMS\nnoise $\\sim20$ mJy beam$^{-1}$ per channel. Lower limits on the brightness\ntemperature range from 27,000 K to 10,000,000 K showing the emission is of\nnon-thermal origin. We also provide a list of 23 OH (1612), 14 OH (1665), 5 OH\n(1667) and 5 OH(1720 MHz) masers. The origin of such a large number of methanol\nmasers is not clear. Many methanol masers appear to be associated with infrared\ndark clouds, though it appears unlikely that the entire population of masers\ntrace early phase of star formation in the Galactic center.\n", "  We have added a new multigrid in energy (MGE) preconditioner to the Denovo\ndiscrete-ordinates radiation transport code. This preconditioner takes\nadvantage of a new multilevel parallel decomposition. A multigroup Krylov\nsubspace iterative solver that is decomposed in energy as well as space-angle\nforms the backbone of the transport solves in Denovo. The space-angle-energy\ndecomposition facilitates scaling to hundreds of thousands of cores. The\nmultigrid in energy preconditioner scales well in the energy dimension and\nsignificantly reduces the number of Krylov iterations required for convergence.\nThis preconditioner is well-suited for use with advanced eigenvalue solvers\nsuch as Rayleigh Quotient Iteration and Arnoldi.\n", "  Core hole resonance is used in X-ray spectroscopy to incisively probe the\nlocal electronic states of many-body systems. Here, resonant inelastic X-ray\nscattering (RIXS) is studied as a function of incident photon energy on Mott\ninsulators SrCuO2 and NiO to examine how resonance states decay into different\nexcitation symmetries at the transition metal M-, L- and K-edges. Quantum\ninterference patterns characteristic of the two major RIXS mechanisms are\nidentified within the data, and used to distinguish the attosecond scale\nscattering dynamics by which fundamental excitations of a many-body system are\ncreated. A function is proposed to experimentally evaluate whether a particular\nexcitation has constructive or destructive interference in the RIXS\ncross-section, and corroborates other evidence that an anomalous excitation is\npresent at the leading edge of the Mott gap in quasi-one dimensional SrCuO2.\n", "  Molecular dynamics computer simulations of a binary Lennard-Jones glass under\nshear are presented. The mechanical response of glassy states having different\nthermal histories is investigated by imposing a wide range of external shear\nrates, at different temperatures. The stress-strain relations exhibit an\novershoot at a strain of around 0.1, marking the yielding of the glass sample\nand the onset of plastic flow. The amplitude of the overshoot shows a\nlogarithmic behavior with respect to a dimensionless variable, given by the age\nof the sample times the shear rate. Dynamical heterogeneities having finite\nlifetimes, in the form of shear bands, are observed as the glass deforms under\nshear. By quantifying the spatial fluctuations of particle mobility, we\ndemonstrate that such shearbanding occurs only under specific combinations of\nimposed shear-rate, age of glass and ambient temperature.\n", "  We study the internal radial gradients of stellar population properties\nwithin $1.5\\;R_{\\rm e}$ and analyse the impact of galaxy environment. We use a\nrepresentative sample of 721 galaxies with masses ranging between\n$10^{9}\\;M_{\\odot}$ to $10^{11.5}\\;M_{\\odot}$ from the SDSS-IV survey MaNGA. We\nsplit this sample by morphology into early-type and late-type galaxies. Using\nthe full spectral fitting code FIREFLY, we derive the light and mass-weighted\nstellar population properties age and metallicity, and calculate the gradients\nof these properties. We use three independent methods to quantify galaxy\nenvironment, namely the $N^{th}$ nearest neighbour, the tidal strength\nparameter $Q$ and distinguish between central and satellite galaxies. In our\nanalysis, we find that early-type galaxies generally exhibit shallow\nlight-weighted age gradients in agreement with the literature and mass-weighted\nmedian age gradients tend to be slightly positive. Late-type galaxies, instead,\nhave negative light-weighted age gradients. We detect negative metallicity\ngradients in both early and late-type galaxies that correlate with galaxy mass,\nwith the gradients being steeper and the correlation with mass being stronger\nin late-types. We find, however, that stellar population gradients, for both\nmorphological classifications, have no significant correlation with galaxy\nenvironment for all three characterisations of environment. Our results suggest\nthat galaxy mass is the main driver of stellar population gradients in both\nearly and late-type galaxies, and any environmental dependence, if present at\nall, must be very subtle.\n", "  A brief discussion is presented assessing the achievements and challenges of\nstring phenomenology: the subfield dedicated to study the potential for string\ntheory to make contact with particle physics and cosmology. Building from the\nwell understood case of the standard model as a very particular example within\nquantum field theory we highlight the very few generic observable implications\nof string theory, most of them inaccessible to low-energy experiments, and\nindicate the need to extract concrete scenarios and classes of models that\ncould eventually be contrasted with searches in collider physics and other\nparticle experiments as well as in cosmological observations. The impact that\nthis subfield has had in mathematics and in a better understanding of string\ntheory is emphasised as spin-offs of string phenomenology. Moduli fields,\nmeasuring the size and shape of extra dimensions, are highlighted as generic\nlow-energy remnants of string theory that can play a key role for supersymmetry\nbreaking as well as for inflationary and post-inflationary early universe\ncosmology. It is argued that the answer to the question in the title should be,\nas usual, {\\it No}. Future challenges for this field are briefly mentioned.\nThis essay is a contribution to the conference: \"Why Trust a Theory?\", Munich,\nDecember 2015.\n", "  We propose a scheme for engineering compressed spatial states in a\ntwo-dimensional parabolic potential with a spin-orbit coupling by selective\nspin measurements. This sequence of measurements results in a\ncoordinate-dependent density matrix with probability maxima achieved at a set\nof lines or at a two dimensional lattice. The resultant probability density\ndepends on the spin-orbit coupling and the potential parameters and allows one\nto obtain a broad class of localized pure states on demand. The proposed scheme\ncan be realized in spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates.\n", "  The structure of the rate of variation of the atomic energy for an arbitrary\nstationary motion of the atom in interaction with a quantum electromagnetic\nfield is investigated. Our main purpose is to rewrite the formalism in Ref.\n\\cite{zz} and to deduce the general expressions of the Einstein A coefficients\nof an atom on an arbitrary stationary trajectory. The total rate of change of\nthe energy and Einstein coefficients of the atom near a plate with finite\ntemperature or acceleration are also investigated.\n", "  Unlike spiral galaxies such as the Milky Way, the majority of the stars in\nmassive elliptical galaxies were formed in a short period early in the history\nof the Universe. The duration of this formation period can be measured using\nthe ratio of magnesium to iron abundance ([Mg/Fe]), which reflects the relative\nenrichment by core-collapse and type Ia supernovae. For local galaxies, [Mg/Fe]\nprobes the combined formation history of all stars currently in the galaxy,\nincluding younger and metal-poor stars that were added during late-time\nmergers. Therefore, to directly constrain the initial star-formation period, we\nmust study galaxies at earlier epochs. The most distant galaxy for which\n[Mg/Fe] had previously been measured is at z~1.4, with\n[Mg/Fe]=0.45(+0.05,-0.19). A slightly earlier epoch (z~1.6) was probed by\nstacking the spectra of 24 massive quiescent galaxies, yielding an average\n[Mg/Fe] of 0.31+/-0.12. However, the relatively low S/N of the data and the use\nof index analysis techniques for both studies resulted in measurement errors\nthat are too large to allow us to form strong conclusions. Deeper spectra at\neven earlier epochs in combination with analysis techniques based on full\nspectral fitting are required to precisely measure the abundance pattern\nshortly after the major star-forming phase (z>2). Here we report a measurement\nof [Mg/Fe] for a massive quiescent galaxy at z=2.1. With [Mg/Fe]=0.59+/-0.11,\nthis galaxy is the most Mg-enhanced massive galaxy found so far, having twice\nthe Mg enhancement of similar-mass galaxies today. The abundance pattern of the\ngalaxy is consistent with enrichment exclusively by core-collapse supernovae\nand with a star-formation timescale of 0.1-0.5 Gyr - characteristics that are\nsimilar to population II stars in the Milky Way. With an average past SFR of\n600-3000 Msol/yr, this galaxy was among the most vigorous star-forming galaxies\nin the Universe.\n", "  At zero temperature, the Lorentz invariance is strictly preserved in\nthree-dimensional quantum electrodynamics. This property ensures that the\nvelocity of massless fermions is not renormalized by the gauge interaction. At\nfinite temperature, however, the Lorentz invariance is explicitly broken by the\nthermal fluctuation. The longitudinal component of gauge interaction becomes\nshort-ranged due to thermal screening, whereas the transverse component remains\nlong-ranged because of local gauge invariance. The transverse gauge interaction\nleads to singular corrections to the fermion self-energy and thus results in an\nunusual renormalization of the fermion velocity. We calculate the renormalized\nfermion velocity $v^R(p_0,\\mathbf{p},T)$ by employing a renormalization group\nanalysis, and discuss the influence of the anomalous dimension $\\eta_n$ on the\nfermion specific heat.\n", "  A quantum memory protocol of controlled ac Stark echoes (CASE) based on a\ndouble rephasing photon echo scheme via controlled Rabi flopping is proposed. A\ndouble rephasing scheme of photon echoes inherently satisfies the no-population\ninversion requirement for quantum memories, but the resultant absorptive echo\nhas been a fundamental problem. In the present studies, firstly, the first echo\nin the double rephasing scheme is dynamically controlled not to affect the\nsecond echo by using unbalanced ac Stark shifts. Secondly, a control Rabi pulse\ncoherently manipulates the second echo to be emissive via controlled coherence\nconversion. Owing to far-off resonance of ac Stark fields, the present protocol\ncan be applied for wavelength-selective dynamic control of quantum memories in\nreal time for erasing, buffering, and multiplexing.\n", "  We describe the results of 3D simulations of the interaction of hydrodynamic\nshocks with Bonnor-Ebert spheres performed with an Adaptive Mesh Refinement\ncode. The calculations are isothermal and the clouds are embedded in a medium\nin which the sound speed is either four or ten times that in the cloud. The\nstrengths of the shocks are such that they induce gravitational collapse in\nsome cases and not in others and we derive a simple estimate for the shock\nstrength required for this to occur. These results are relevant to dense cores\nand Bok globules in star forming regions subjected to shocks produced by\nstellar feedback.\n", "  (Abridged) We present a large, uniform analysis of young (~10-150 Myr)\nultracool dwarfs, based on new high-precision IR parallaxes for 68 objects. We\nfind that low-gravity (VL-G) late-M and L dwarfs form a continuous sequence in\nIR color-magnitude diagrams, separate from field objects and current\ntheoretical models. VL-G objects also appear distinct from young substellar\n(brown dwarf and exoplanet) companions, suggesting the two populations have a\ndifferent range of physical properties. In contrast, at the L/T transition,\nyoung, old, and peculiar objects all span a narrow range in near-IR absolute\nmagnitudes. At a given spectral type, the IR absolute magnitudes of young\nobjects can be offset from ordinary field dwarfs, with the largest offsets\noccurring in the Y and J bands for late-M dwarfs (brighter than the field) and\nmid/late-L dwarfs (fainter than the field). Overall, low-gravity (VL-G) objects\nhave the most uniform photometric behavior while intermediate-gravity (INT-G)\nobjects are more diverse, suggesting a third governing parameter beyond\nspectral type and gravity class. We examine the moving group memberships for\nall young ultracool dwarfs with parallaxes, changing/refuting the status of 23\nobjects and fortifying the status of another 28 objects. We use our resulting\nage-calibrated sample to establish empirical young isochrones and find a\ndeclining frequency of VL-G objects relative to INT-G objects with increasing\nage. Notable objects in our sample include high-velocity INT-G objects; very\nred, late-L dwarfs with high surface gravities; candidate disk-bearing members\nof the MBM20 cloud and beta Pic moving group; and very young distant\ninterlopers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive summary of the absolute\nmagnitudes and spectral classifications of 102 young ultracool dwarfs, found in\nthe field and as substellar companions to young stars.\n", "  Next year we will celebrate 100 years of the cosmological term, $\\Lambda$, in\nEinstein's gravitational field equations, also 50 years since the cosmological\nconstant problem was first formulated by Zeldovich, and almost about two\ndecades of the observational evidence that a non-vanishing, positive,\n$\\Lambda$-term could be the simplest phenomenological explanation for the\nobserved acceleration of the Universe. This mixed state of affairs already\nshows that we do no currently understand the theoretical nature of $\\Lambda$.\nIn particular, we are still facing the crucial question whether $\\Lambda$ is\ntruly a fundamental constant or a mildly evolving dynamical variable. At this\npoint the matter should be settled once more empirically and, amazingly enough,\nthe wealth of observational data at our disposal can presently shed true light\non it. In this short review I summarize the situation of some of these studies.\nIt turns out that the $\\Lambda=$const. hypothesis, despite being the simplest,\nmay well not be the most favored one when we put it in hard-fought competition\nwith specific dynamical models of the vacuum energy. Recently it has been shown\nthat the overall fit to the cosmological observables\n$SNIa+BAO+H(z)+LSS+BBN+CMB$ do favor the class of \"running\" vacuum models\n(RVM's) -- in which $\\Lambda=\\Lambda(H)$ is a function of the Hubble rate --\nagainst the \"concordance\" $\\Lambda$CDM model. The support is at an\nunprecedented level of $\\sim4\\sigma$ and is backed up with Akaike and Bayesian\ncriteria leading to compelling evidence in favor of the RVM option and other\nrelated dynamical vacuum models. I also address the implications of this\nframework on the possible time evolution of the fundamental constants of\nNature.\n", "  Classes started in the newly established Physics Department of Calcutta\nUniversity Science College in 1916. Raman, Bose and Saha were three young\nmembers of the small physics faculty consisting of barely half a dozen faculty\nmembers. Within about one decade, three extraordinary discoveries came from\nthese young men---Saha ionization equation in 1920, Bose statistics in 1924,\nRaman effect in 1928. However, fortunes of Calcutta University quickly got\nintertwined with India's freedom struggle led by Mahatma Gandhi exactly at the\nsame time and the physics group got tragically disrupted. Indian physics never\nsucceeded in reaching that height again. This paper discusses the difficulties\nin reconstructing a critical history of this Calcutta school of physics during\nthe very short epoch of unmatched brilliance.\n", "  Approximate analytical solutions of a two-term potential are studied for the\nrelativistic wave equations, namely, for the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations.\nThe results are obtained by solving of a Riemann-type equation whose solution\ncan be written in terms of hypergeometric function $\\,_{2}F_{1}(a,b;c;z)$. The\nenergy eigenvalue equations and the corresponding normalized wave functions are\ngiven both for two wave equations. The results for some special cases including\nthe Manning-Rosen potential, the Hulth\\'{e}n potential and the Coulomb\npotential are also discussed by setting the parameters as required.\n", "  ASTEP (Antarctica Search for Transiting ExoPlanets) is a pilot project that\naims at searching and characterizing transiting exoplanets from Dome C in\nAntarctica and to qualify this site for photometry in the visible. Two\ninstruments were installed at Dome C and ran for six winters in total. The\nanalysis of the collected data is nearly complete. We present the operation of\nthe instruments, and the technical challenges, limitations, and possible\nsolutions in light of the data quality. The instruments performed continuous\nobservations during the winters. Human interventions are required mainly for\nregular inspection and ice dust removal. A defrosting system is efficient at\npreventing and removing ice on the mirrors. The PSF FWHM is 4.5 arcsec on\naverage which is 2.5 times larger than the specification, and is highly\nvariable; the causes are the poor ground-level seeing, the turbulent plumes\ngenerated by the heating system, and to a lower extent the imperfect optical\nalignment and focusing, and some astigmatism. We propose solutions for each of\nthese aspects that would largely increase the PSF stability. The astrometric\nand guiding precisions are satisfactory and would deserve only minor\nimprovements. Major issues are encountered with the camera shutter which did\nnot close properly after two winters; we minimized this issue by heating the\nshutter and by developing specific image calibration algorithms. Finally, we\nsummarize the site testing and science results obtained with ASTEP. Overall,\nthe ASTEP experiment will serve as a basis to design and operate future optical\nand near-infrared telescopes in Antarctica.\n", "  The intriguing superradiant amplification phenomenon allows an orbiting\nscalar field to extract rotational energy from a spinning Kerr black hole.\nInterestingly, the energy extraction rate can grow exponentially in time if the\nblack-hole-field system is placed inside a reflecting mirror which prevents the\nfield from radiating its energy to infinity. This composed\nKerr-black-hole-scalar-field-mirror system, first designed by Press and\nTeukolsky, has attracted the attention of physicists over the last four\ndecades. Previous numerical studies of this spinning {\\it black-hole bomb} have\nrevealed the interesting fact that the superradiant instability shuts down if\nthe reflecting mirror is placed too close to the black-hole horizon. In the\npresent study we use analytical techniques to explore the superradiant\ninstability regime of this composed\nKerr-black-hole-linearized-scalar-field-mirror system. In particular, it is\nproved that the lower bound ${{r_{\\text{m}}}\\over{r_+}}>{1\\over\n2}\\Big(\\sqrt{1+{{8M}\\over{r_-}}}-1\\Big)$ provides a necessary condition for the\ndevelopment of the exponentially growing superradiant instabilities in this\ncomposed physical system, where $r_{\\text{m}}$ is the radius of the confining\nmirror and $r_{\\pm}$ are the horizon radii of the spinning Kerr black hole. We\nfurther show that, in the linearized regime, this {\\it analytically} derived\nlower bound on the radius of the confining mirror agrees with direct {\\it\nnumerical} computations of the superradiant instability spectrum which\ncharacterizes the spinning black-hole-mirror bomb.\n", "  A previous analysis of scaling, bounds, and inequalities for the\nnon-interacting functionals of thermal density functional theory is extended to\nthe full interacting functionals. The results are obtained from analysis of the\nrelated functionals from the equilibrium statistical mechanics of\nthermodynamics for an inhomogeneous system. Their extension to the functionals\nof density functional theory is described.\n", "  Since the ALMA North America Prototype Antenna was awarded to the Smithsonian\nAstrophysical Observatory (SAO), SAO and the Academia Sinica Institute of\nAstronomy & Astrophysics (ASIAA) are working jointly to relocate the antenna to\nGreenland. This paper shows the status of the antenna retrofit and the work\ncarried out after the recommissioning and subsequent disassembly of the antenna\nat the VLA has taken place. The next coming months will see the start of the\nantenna reassembly at Thule Air Base. These activities are expected to last\nuntil the fall of 2017 when commissioning should take place. In parallel,\ndesign, fabrication and testing of the last components are taking place in\nTaiwan.\n", "  Soft nanocomposites represent both a theoretical and an experimental\nchallenge due to the high number of the microscopic constituents that strongly\ninfluence the behaviour of the systems. An effective theoretical description of\nsuch systems invokes a reduction of the degrees of freedom to be analysed,\nhence requiring the introduction of an efficient, quantitative, coarse-grained\ndescription. We here report on a novel coarse graining approach based on a set\nof transferable potentials that quantitatively reproduces properties of\nmixtures of linear and star-shaped homopolymeric nanocomposites. By\nrenormalizing groups of monomers into a single effective potential between a\n$f$-functional star polymer and an homopolymer of length $N_0$, and through a\nscaling argument, it will be shown how a substantial reduction of the to\ndegrees of freedom allows for a full quantitative description of the system.\nOur methodology is tested upon full monomer simulations for systems of\ndifferent molecular weight, proving its full predictive potential.\n", "  We construct a new class of Einstein-Maxwell static solutions with a magnetic\nfield in $D$-dimensions (with $D\\geq 5$ an odd number), approaching at infinity\na globally Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. In addition to the mass, the new\nsolutions possess an extra-parameter associated with a non-zero magnitude of\nthe magnetic potential at infinity. Some of the black holes possess a\nnon-trivial zero-horizon size limit, which corresponds to a solitonic\ndeformation of the AdS background.\n", "  Based on the Roe solver a new technique that allows to correctly represent\nlow Mach number flows with a discretization of the compressible Euler equations\nwas proposed in Miczek et al.: New numerical solver for flows at various mach\nnumbers. A&A 576, A50 (2015). We analyze properties of this scheme and\ndemonstrate that its limit yields a discretization of the continuous limit\nsystem. Furthermore we perform a linear stability analysis for the case of\nexplicit time integration and study the performance of the scheme under\nimplicit time integration via the evolution of its condition number. A\nnumerical implementation demonstrates the capabilities of the scheme on the\nexample of the Gresho vortex which can be accurately followed down to Mach\nnumbers of ~1e-10 .\n", "  In this paper we present a dimensional renormalization scheme suitable for\nholographic theories. We use the bulk physics in the supergravity limit as a\ndefinition of the dual CFT. Similar to the perturbative quantization of a QFT,\none is free to choose a convenient renormalization scheme, and the holographic\nrenormalization method is only one such choice. We show how the bulk theory can\nbe rendered finite with a renormalization scheme that corresponds to\ndimensional renormalization in the dual CFT. The method does not require any\ncut-offs and does not introduce any dimensionful parameters. It delivers a\none-to-one map between bulk and boundary counterterms and leads to an exact and\nunambiguous identification of field theoretical objects in terms of bulk data.\nIn particular, we resolve long standing issues regarding the identification of\nthe renormalization scale and beta functions on both sides of the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence. Furthermore, the method is considerably simpler than standard\nholographic renormalization on a practical level when evaluating correlation\nfunctions.\n", "  Much of what I have to say in the following (not all) is contained in my\nInformal History published in 2010 in the Intl Journ of Mod Phys and available\nas arXiv:1011.2736 [cond-mat]. But because the literature on the subject\ncontinues to burgeon, mostly without much if any reference to the fundamentals\nthat I laid out in that article, I think it is time to distribute a summary of\nthe conclusions I reached in that article, as well as a few newer thoughts.\n", "  The mean square displacement (MSD) of an argon molecule as a function of time\nis studied. Its deviations from the standard asymptotic law for intermediate\ntimes are analyzed in details. It is shown that these deviations are mainly\nconnected with the square-root contribution to the MSD which is proportional\nthe ratio of the collective part to the full self-diffusion coefficient. It is\nestablished that the relative value of the collective contribution to the\nself-diffusion coefficient of argon changes from 0.23 near the triple point up\nto 0.4 at approaching the critical point. A new method for the determination of\nthe Maxwell relaxation time is proposed. Its temperature dependence on the\ncoexistence curve and one of isochors is investigated.\n", "  We report the results of the statistical analysis of planetary signals\ndiscovered in MOA-II microlensing survey alert system events from 2007 to 2012.\nWe determine the survey sensitivity as a function of planet-star mass ratio,\n$q$, and projected planet-star separation, $s$, in Einstein radius units. We\nfind that the mass ratio function is not a single power-law, but has a change\nin slope at $q \\sim 10^{-4}$, corresponding to $\\sim 20 M_{\\oplus}$ for the\nmedian host star mass of $\\sim 0.6 M_{\\odot}$. We find significant planetary\nsignals in 23 of the 1474 alert events that are well characterized by the\nMOA-II survey data alone. Data from other groups are used only to characterize\nplanetary signals that have been identified in the MOA data alone. The\ndistribution of mass ratios and separations of the planets found in our sample\nare well fit by a broken power-law model of the form $dN_{\\rm pl}/(d{\\rm log}\nq\\ d{\\rm log} s) = A (q/q_{\\rm br})^n s^m \\, {\\rm dex}^{-2}$ for $q > q_{\\rm\nbr}$ and $dN_{\\rm pl}/(d{\\rm log} q\\ d{\\rm log} s) = A (q/q_{\\rm br})^p s^m \\,\n{\\rm dex}^{-2}$ for $q < q_{\\rm br}$, where $q_{\\rm br}$ is the mass ratio of\nthe break. We also combine this analysis with the previous analyses of Gould et\nal. and Cassan et al., bringing the total sample to 30 planets. This combined\nanalysis yields $A = 0.61^{+0.21}_{-0.16}$, $n =-0.93\\pm 0.13$, $m =\n0.49_{-0.49}^{+0.47}$ and $p = 0.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ for $q_{\\rm br}\\equiv\n1.7\\times 10^{-4}$. The unbroken power law model is disfavored with a $p$-value\nof 0.0022, which corresponds to a Bayes factor of 27 favoring the broken\npower-law model. These results imply that cold Neptunes are likely to be the\nmost common type of planets beyond the snow line.\n", "  Closed expression for the Green's function of the stationary two-dimensional\nSchrodinger equation for an electron in group-VI dichalcogenides in the\npresence of a magnetic field is obtained in terms of the Whittaker functions.\nThe resulting Green's function operator is a~$8 \\times 8$ matrix consisting of\nfour block-diagonal~$2\\times 2$ matrices, each of them characterized by\ndifferent values of valley index and electron spin. The obtained results are\nused to calculate local density of states induced by a neutral delta-like\nimpurity in the presence of a magnetic field within the lowest Born\napproximation. The spatial electron density experiences either the Friedel-like\noscillations or an exponential decay as a function of the distance from the\nimpurity.\n", "  Citations are commonly held to represent scientific impact. To date, however,\nthere is no empirical evidence in support of this postulate that is central to\nresearch assessment exercises and Science of Science studies. Here, we report\non the first empirical verification of the degree to which citation numbers\nrepresent scientific impact as it is actually perceived by experts in their\nrespective field. We run a large-scale survey of about 2000 corresponding\nauthors who performed a pairwise impact assessment task across more than 20000\nscientific articles. Results of the survey show that citation data and\nperceived impact do not align well, unless one properly accounts for strong\npsychological biases that affect the opinions of experts with respect to their\nown papers vs. those of others. First, researchers tend to largely prefer their\nown publications to the most cited papers in their field of research. Second,\nthere is only a mild positive correlation between the number of citations of\ntop-cited papers in given research areas and expert preference in pairwise\ncomparisons. This also applies to pairs of papers with several orders of\nmagnitude differences in their total number of accumulated citations. However,\nwhen researchers were asked to choose among pairs of their own papers, thus\neliminating the bias favouring one's own papers over those of others, they did\nsystematically prefer the most cited article. We conclude that, when scientists\nhave full information and are making unbiased choices, expert opinion on impact\nis congruent with citation numbers.\n", "  A topological insulator (TI), a new quantum state featured with the\ntopologically-protected surface state (TSS) originating from its peculiar\ntopology in band structure, has attracted much interest due to academic and\npractical importance. Nonetheless, a large contribution of the bulk conduction,\ninduced by unintended doping by defects, has hindered the characterization of\nthe unique surface state and the utilization of it into a device. To resolve\nthis problem, we have investigated the transport properties of epitaxial\nBi2-xSnxTe3 thin films with varying x. With the bulk conduction being strongly\nsuppressed, the TSS is separately characterized, resulting in a large phase\nrelaxation length of ~250 nm at 1.8 K, a record-high value in TIs. In addition,\nthe magnetoresistance ratio (MR) has shown a non-monotonic temperature\ndependence with a maximum value at an elevated temperature depending on x.\nThese results are associated with the compensation of carriers and, we believe,\nprovide an important step for the application of topological insulators for\ndeveloping novel functional devices based on the topological surface states.\n", "  We present a comprehensive analysis of the landscape for full quantum-quantum\ncontrol associated with the expectation value of an arbitrary observable of one\nquantum system controlled by another quantum system. It is shown that such full\nquantum-quantum control landscapes are convex, and hence devoid of local\nsuboptima and saddle points that may exist in landscapes for quantum systems\ncontrolled by time-dependent classical fields. There is no controllability\nrequirement for the full quantum-quantum landscape to be trap-free, although\nthe forms of Hamiltonians, the flexibility in choosing initial state of the\ncontroller, as well as the control duration, can infulence the reachable\noptimal value on the landscape. All level sets of the full quantum-quantum\nlandscape are connected convex sets. Finally, we show that the optimal solution\nof the full quantum-quantum control landscape can be readily determined\nnumerically, which is demonstrated using the Jaynes-Cummings model depicting a\ntwo-level atom interacting with a quantized radiation field.\n", "  We investigate a mechanical method to manipulate magnetic Bloch Skyrmions by\napplying an electric field in a composite chiral-magnetic (CM)/ferroelectric\n(FE) bilayer. The magnetoelectric coupling at the interface allows the electric\nfield to stimulate magnetic ordering. Therefore it offers the possibility to\ngenerate Skyrmions [Phys. Rev. B 94, 014311 (2016)]. Here, we design a movable\nand localized electric field source to drive skyrmion transport along the\nbilayer. A traveling velocity of the electric field source must be carefully\nchosen to show the stability and effciency of this process. The effects of high\nspeed operation will be discussed.\n", "  Relativistic strophotron is a system in which fast electrons move along a\npotential trough produced by quadrupole electric lenses. Equations of motion in\nthe strophotron field are investigated and electron trajectories are found. It\nis shown, that electrons are harmonically oscillating in transverse direction\nand do complex motion in longitudinal direction.\n", "  Working in the first order formalism of gravity, we propose an action that\ncombines the self and anti-self-dual parts of the curvature and comprises all\nthe diffeomorphism invariant Lagrangians that one can consider in this\nformalism. The action that we propose is motivated by (A)dS gauge theories of\ngravity. We use this action to derive the (2+1)-dimensional version of the\nImmirzi parameter. Our derivation relates explicitly the Immirzi parameter to\nthe existence of two classically equivalent actions for the description of\ngravity in (2+1) dimensions, namely the standard and exotic actions introduced\nby Witten in the description of (2+1) gravity as a gauge theory. This relation\nhad been conjectured previously in the literature, but not derived.\n", "  Oscillators, which produce continuous periodic signals from direct current\npower, are central to modern communications systems, with versatile\napplications such as timing references and frequency modulators. However,\nconventional oscillators typically consist of macroscopic mechanical resonators\nsuch as quartz crystals, which require excessive off-chip space. Here we report\noscillators built on micron-size, atomically-thin graphene nanomechanical\nresonators, whose frequencies can be electrostatically tuned by as much as\n14\\%. The self-sustaining mechanical motion of the oscillators is generated and\ntransduced at room temperature by simple electrical circuitry. The prototype\ngraphene voltage controlled oscillators exhibit frequency stability and\nmodulation bandwidth sufficient for modulation of radio-frequency carrier\nsignals. As a demonstration, we employ a graphene oscillator as the active\nelement for frequency modulated signal generation, and achieve efficient audio\nsignal transmission.\n", "  The topologically nontrivial and chemically functional distorted octahedral\n(T') transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are a type of layered semimetal\nthat has attracted significant recent attention. However, the properties of\nmonolayer (1L) T'-TMDC, a fundamental unit of the system, is still largely\nunknown due to rapid sample degradation in air. Here we report that\nwell-protected 1L CVD T'-MoTe2 exhibits sharp and robust intrinsic Raman bands,\nwith intensities about one order of magnitude stronger than those from bulk\nT'-MoTe2. The high-quality samples enabled us to reveal the set of all nine\neven-parity zone-center optical phonons, providing reliable fingerprints for\nthe previously elusive crystal. By performing light polarization and crystal\norientation resolved scattering analysis, we can effectively distinguish the\nintrinsic modes from Te-metalloid-like modes A (~122 cm-1) and B (~141 cm-1)\nwhich are related to the sample degradation. Our studies offer a powerful\nnon-destructive method for assessing sample quality and for monitoring sample\ndegradation in situ, representing a solid advance in understanding the\nfundamental properties of 1L-T'-TMDCs.\n", "  The dissolution enthalpies of BaCe0.7Ho0.2In0.1O2.85 and\nBaCe0.7Sm0.2In0.1O2.85 were measured by method of solution calorimetry in 1M\nhydrochloric acid with adding 0.1 M KI. The obtained data were compared with\nearlier measured data on dissolution enthalpies of BaCe0.7Nd0.2In0.1O2.85,\nBaCe0.7Gd0.2In0.1O2.85. The dependence of dissolution enthalpies from\nlanthanide radius was constructed. As was shown the relationship is not linear.\n", "  Level set method has been used to capture interface motion. Narrow band\nalgorithm is applied to localize the solving of level-set PDE on global domain\nto a tube around interface. Due to the unknown evolving interface, narrow band\nalgorithm brings load balance problem for parallelizing computing. This work\npresents a tool for evenly distributing work loads on CPUs. On the other hand,\nnumerically solving level-set PDE only needs simple operations but on large\ngrid points. This work also presents a GPU acceleration for solving level-set\nPDE using finite difference method.\n", "  Weak gravitational lensing (WL) causes distortions of galaxy images and\nprobes massive structures on large scales, allowing us to understand the\nlate-time evolution of the Universe. One way to extract the cosmological\ninformation from WL is to use peak statistics. Peaks are tracers of massive\nhalos and therefore probe the mass function. They retain non-Gaussian\ninformation and have already been shown as a promising tool to constrain\ncosmology. In this work, we develop a new model to predict WL peak counts. The\nmodel generates fast simulations based on halo sampling and selects peaks from\nthe derived lensing maps. This approach has three main advantages. First, the\nmodel is very fast: only several seconds are required to perform a realization.\nSecond, including realistic conditions is straightforward. Third, the model\nprovides the full distribution information because of its stochasticity. We\nshow that our model agrees well with N-body simulations. Then, we study the\nimpacts of the cosmology-dependent covariance on constraints and explore\ndifferent parameter inference methods. A special focus is put on approximate\nBayesian computation (ABC), an accept-reject sampler without the need to\nestimate the likelihood. We show that ABC is able to yield robust constraints\nwith much reduced time costs. Several filtering techniques are studied to\nimprove the extraction of multiscale information. Finally, the new model is\napplied to the CFHTLenS, KiDS DR1/2, and DES SV data sets. Our preliminary\nresults agree with the Planck constraints assuming the Lambda-CDM model.\nOverall, this thesis forges an innovative tool for future WL surveys. The\nmanuscript provides a brief review on WL peak counts.\n", "  The Journal Impact Factor (JIF) has been heavily criticized over decades.\nThis opinion piece argues that the JIF should not be demonized. It still can be\nemployed for research evaluation purposes by carefully considering the context\nand academic environment.\n", "  We present our latest calculations of $K^-$-nuclear quasi-bound states using\na self-consistent scheme for constructing $K^-$-nuclear potentials from various\nsubthreshold chirally inspired $\\bar{K}N$ scattering amplitudes. We consider\nin-medium versions of the scattering amplitudes taking into account Pauli\nblocking in the intermediate states. The resulting $K^-$ binding energies as\nwell as the widths exhibit the same A dependence, however, the binding energies\nstrongly depend on the model used.\n", "  Gamma-ray polarimetry is a new powerful tool to study the processes\nresponsible for the emission from astrophysical sources and the environments in\nwhich this emission takes place. Few successful polarimetric measurements have\nhowever been performed thus far in the gamma-ray energy band due to the\ndifficulties involved. POLAR is a dedicated polarimeter designed to perform\nhigh precision measurements of the polarization of the emission from gamma-ray\nburst in the 50-500 keV energy range. This new polarimeter is expected to\ndetect approximately 50 gamma-ray bursts per year while performing high\nprecision polarization measurements on approximately 10 bursts per year. The\ninstrument was launched into lower earth orbit as part of the second Chinese\nspace lab, the Tiangong-2, on September 15th 2016 and has been taking data\nsuccessfully since being switched on one week after. The instrument uses a\nsegmented scintillator array consisting of 1600 plastic scintillator bars, read\nout by 25 flat-panel multi-anode photomultipliers, to measure the Compton\nscattering angles of incoming photons. The small segmentation and relatively\nlarge uniform effective area allow the instrument to measure the polarization\nof a large number of transient events, such as gamma-ray bursts, with an\nunprecedented precision during its two year life-time. The final flight model\nunderwent detailed calibration prior to launch as well as intensive space\nqualification tests, a summary of which will be presented in this paper. The\ninstrument design will be discussed first followed by an overview of the\non-ground tests, finally the in-orbit behavior as measured during the first\nweeks of the mission will be presented.\n", "  The magnetic field structure associated with edge localised ideal ballooning\nmode (ELM) bursts is analysed by nonlinear gyrofluid computation. The linear\ngrowth phase is characterised by the formation of small scale magnetic islands.\nErgodic magnetic field regions develop near the end of the linear phase when\nthe instability starts to perturb the equilibrium profiles. The nonlinear\nblow-out gives rise to an ergodisation of the entire edge region. The\ntime-dependent level of ergodicity is determined in terms of the mean radial\ndisplacement of a magnetic field line. The ergodicity decreases again during\nthe nonlinear turbulent phase of the blow-out in dependence on the degrading\nplasma beta in the collapsing plasma pedestal profile.\n", "  Atomically thin semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides provide novel\ninsights into the physics of many-body effects mediated by Coulomb\ninteractions. Here, we report on temperature-dependent ($T$ = 7-295 K)\nreflectance contrast and photoluminescence studies of three-particle complexes\nin n-doped WS$_2$ monolayers. In low-temperature reflectance contrast spectra\nwe observe distinct resonances of the neutral exciton, negative trion and\nexciton bound to a donor (X, X$^-$ and X$^D$). For temperatures above 80 K,\nreflectance contrast signatures of the X$^D$ disappear, whereas the X$^-$\nremains detectable up to 240 K, despite the fact that the X$^D$ signal is more\nred-shifted from the neutral exciton than that of the X$^-$. This experimental\nobservation underlines that in WS$_2$ the dissociation energy of X$^-$\nconsiderably exceeds (factor of 2.5) that of X$^D$. In the laser-power\ndependent photoluminescence experiments, performed at room temperature, we\ndemonstrate the control of the intensity ratio and energy position of the X and\nX$^-$ lines, which allows us to evaluate the trion binding energy. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that the room-temperature PL is sensitive to the environmental gas\n(ambient, N$_2$, He).\n", "  In the race towards high-performance ultra-scaled devices, two-dimensional\nmaterials offer an alternative paradigm thanks to their atomic thickness\nsuppressing short-channel effects. It is thus urgent to study the most\npromising candidates in realistic configurations, and here we present detailed\nmultiscale simulations of field-effect transistors based on arsenene and\nantimonene monolayers as channels. The accuracy of first-principles approaches\nin describing electronic properties is combined with the efficiency of\ntight-binding Hamiltonians based on maximally-localised Wannier functions to\ncompute the transport properties of the devices. These simulations provide for\nthe first time estimates on the upper limits for the electron and hole\nmobilities in the Takagi's approximation, including spin-orbit and multi-valley\neffects, and demonstrate that ultra-scaled devices in the sub-10 nm scale show\na performance that is compliant with industry requirements.\n", "  Let $\\mathfrak{g}$ be a simple Lie algebra of rank $r$ over $\\mathbb{C}$,\n$\\mathfrak{h} \\subset \\mathfrak{g}$ a Cartan subalgebra. We construct a family\nof $r$ commuting Hermitian operators acting on $\\mathfrak{h}$ whose eigenvalues\nare equal to the coordinates of the eigenvectors of the Cartan matrix of\n$\\mathfrak{g}$.\n", "  We develop a versatile and analytically solvable potential which fairly\nreproduces the combined potential of an $\\alpha+$nucleus system resulting from\nboth the attractive nuclear and repulsive electrostatic potentials. The\npotential is expressed in terms of the radial position, mass and proton number\nof the $\\alpha$-particle and the daughter nucleus and certain parameters\ngoverning the depth, height and steepness of the barrier. The potential\ngenerated is typically a pocket near the origin and a barrier adjacent to it.\nThe Schr\\\"odinger equation with the above mentioned potential is then solved\nfor the wave function. This potential produces discrete positive energy\nquasibound state known as resonance state. By matching the wave function and\nits derivative with the regular Coulomb wave function $F_0$ and irregular\nCoulomb wave function $G_0$, we obtain the S-matrix analytically. The resonance\nis obtained from the pole in complex energy plane which gives the width of the\ncorresponding time of decay through the imaginary part of the energy pole\nposition. We make a comparative study of the measured half-lives of various\nnuclei with the calculated half-lives. The calculated values of half-lives\nclosely match with the corresponding experimental results.\n", "  Using a microfluidic trap, we study the behavior of individual phospholipid\nvesicles in contact with fatty acids. We show that spontaneous fatty acids\ninsertion inside the bilayer is controlled by the vesicle size, osmotic\npressure difference across the membrane and fatty acids concentration in the\nexternal bath. Depending on these parameters, vesicles can grow spherically or\nbecome unstable and fragment into several daughter vesicles. We establish the\nphase diagram for vesicle growth and we derive a simple thermodynamic model\nthat reproduces the time evolution of the vesicle volume. Finally, we show that\nstable growth can be achieved on an artificial cell expressing a simple set of\nbacterial cytoskeletal proteins, paving the way toward artificial cell\nreproduction.\n", "  Although Geiger-Nuttall (GN) law gives a single straight line, if we consider\nthe experimental data of alpha particle emitters including heavy and super\nheavy nuclei with proton numbers as large as 118, instead of getting a single\nlinear path we observe several linear segments with different slopes and\nintercepts. This problem is overcome when the experimental results in logarithm\nform are plotted as a function of Viola-Seaborg (VS) parameters with values of\nparameters set by hand. By using the fundamental principle of decay, we derive\na formula of logarithm of half-lives in terms of well-defined parameters or\ncoefficients and this replaces the empirical VS rule.\n", "  The influence of steep density gradient upon stirring properties of a strain\nflow is addressed by considering the problem in which an interface separating\ntwo regions with different constant densities is stabilised within a\nstagnation-point flow. The existence of an analytic solution for the\ntwo-dimensional incompressible flow field allows the exact derivation of the\nvelocity gradient tensor and of parameters describing the local flow topology.\nStirring properties are affected not only through vorticity production and jump\nof strain intensity at the interface, but also through rotation of strain\nprincipal axes resulting from anisotropy of pressure Hessian. The strain\npersistence parameter, which measures the respective effects of strain and\neffective rotation (vorticity plus rotation rate of strain basis), reveals a\ncomplex structure. In particular, for large values of the density ratio it\nindicates dominating effective rotation in a restricted area past the\ninterface. Information on flow structure derived from the Okubo-Weiss\nparameter, by contrast, is less detailed. The influence of the density step on\nstirring properties is assessed through the Lagrangian evolution of the\ngradient of a passive scalar. Even for a moderate density ratio, alignment of\nthe scalar gradient and growth rate of its norm are deeply altered. Past the\ninterface effective rotation indeed drives the scalar gradient to align with a\ndirection determined by the local strain persistence parameter, away from the\ncompressional strain direction. The jump of strain intensity at the interface,\nhowever, opposes the lessening effect of the latter mechanism on the growth\nrate of the scalar gradient norm and promotes the rise of the gradient.\n", "  We consider the semi-classical limit of nonlinear Schrodinger equations in\nthe presence of both a polynomial nonlinearity and thederivative in space of a\npolynomial nonlinearity. By working in a class of analytic initial data, we do\nnot have to assume any hyperbolicstructure on the (limiting) phase/amplitude\nsystem. The solution, its approximation, and the error estimates are considered\nin time dependent analyticregularity.\n", "  A periodic arrangement of one-dimensional slits carved in perfect electric\nconductor is investigated and an equivalent model based on the effective medium\ntheory is derived. The proposed model is no longer fully homogeneous and\nfeatures periodic surface conductivity on its upper and lower interfaces.\nTherefore, and in sheer contrast to all the previous attempts that were\nsuccessful in mimicking only the zeroth-order diffracted waves, it is capable\nof emulating both specular and non-specular diffraction orders. The parameters\nof the equivalent model are found by comparing the scattered waves of the\nproposed model against those of the original structure obtained by invoking the\nrigorous mode matching technique based on the single mode approximation inside\nthe slits. The proposed model is characterized by diagonal anisotropic\npermittivity and permeability tensors together with a periodic surface\nconductivity at the interfaces of the metallic grating and the ambient\nenvironment. The accuracy of the model is verified by the full-wave\nsimulations. The proposed approach might be useful for devising applications\nwhich work based on the characteristics of higher Floquet orders.\n", "  Moving mesh methods provide an efficient way of solving partial differential\nequations for which large, localised variations in the solution necessitate\nlocally dense spatial meshes. In one-dimension, meshes are typically specified\nusing the arclength mesh density function. This choice is well-justified for\npiecewise polynomial interpolants, but it is only justified for spectral\nmethods when model solutions include localised steep gradients. In this paper,\none-dimensional mesh density functions are presented which are based on a\nspatially localised measure of the bandwidth of the approximated model\nsolution. In considering bandwidth, these mesh density functions are\nwell-justified for spectral methods, but are not strictly tied to the error\nproperties of any particular spatial interpolant, and are hence widely\napplicable. The bandwidth mesh density functions are demonstrated by applying\nperiodic spectral and finite-difference moving mesh methods to a number of\nmodel problems in acoustics. These problems include a heterogeneous advection\nequation, the viscous Burgers' equation, and the Korteweg-de Vries equation.\nSimulation results demonstrate solution convergence rates that are up to an\norder of magnitude faster using the bandwidth mesh density functions than\nuniform meshes, and around three times faster than those using the arclength\nmesh density function.\n", "  This review aims to cover the central aspects of current research in cosmic\ntopology from a topological and observational perspective. Beginning with an\noverview of the basic concepts of cosmology, it is observed that though a\ndeterminant of local curvature, Einstein's equations of relativity do not\nconstrain the global properties of space-time. The topological requirements of\na universal space time manifold are discussed, including requirements of\nspace-time orientability and causality. The basic topological concepts used in\nclassification of spaces, i.e. the concept of the Fundamental Domain and\nUniversal covering spaces are discussed briefly. The manifold properties and\nsymmetry groups for three dimensional manifolds of constant curvature for\nnegative, positive and zero curvature manifolds are laid out.\nMulti-connectedness is explored as a possible explanation for the detected\nanomalies in the quadrupole and octopole regions of the power spectrum,\npointing at a possible compactness along one or more directions in space. The\nstatistical significance of the evidence, however, is also scrutinized and I\ndiscuss briefly the bayesian and frequentist interpretation of the posterior\nprobabilities of observing the anomalies in a Lambda CDM universe. Some of the\nmajor topologies that have been proposed and investigated as possible\ncandidates of a universal manifold are the Poincare Dodecahedron and Bianchi\nUniverses, which are studied in detail. Lastly, the methods that have been\nproposed for detecting a multi connected signature are discussed. These include\ningenious observational methods like the circles in the sky method, cosmic\ncrystallography and Bayesian Analysis which provides the additional advantage\nof being free from measurement errors and uses the posterior likelihoods of\nmodels. As of the recent Planck mission, no pressing evidence of a multi\nconnected topology has been detected.\n", "  We propose an efficient qubit initialization protocol based on a dissipative\nenvironment that can be dynamically adjusted. Here the qubit is coupled to a\nthermal bath through a tunable harmonic oscillator. On-demand initialization is\nachieved by sweeping the oscillator rapidly into resonance with the qubit. This\nresonant coupling with the engineered environment induces fast relaxation to\nthe ground state of the system, and a consecutive rapid sweep back to off\nresonance guarantees weak excess dissipation during quantum computations. We\nsolve the corresponding quantum dynamics using a Markovian master equation for\nthe reduced density operator of the qubit-bath system. This allows us to\noptimize the parameters and the initialization protocol for the qubit. Our\nanalytical calculations show that the ground-state occupation of our system is\nwell protected during the fast sweeps of the environmental coupling and,\nconsequently, we obtain an estimate for the duration of our protocol by solving\nthe transition rates between the low-energy eigenstates with the Jacobian\ndiagonalization method. Our results suggest that the current experimental state\nof the art for the initialization speed of superconducting qubits at a given\nfidelity can be considerably improved.\n", "  Zeolites, microporous aluminosilicates, are amongst the most widely used\ncatalysts in the petrochemical industry. Zeolite catalytic functionality is\ncoupled to the distribution of tetrahedral alumina (AlO4-) and associated\ncounter-cations throughout the aluminosilicate framework, yet little is\ndefinitively known about the factors that govern framework aluminium\narrangement. It is generally accepted that all zeolites obey Lowensteins rule\nof aluminium avoidance and that Al-O-Al linkages are forbidden. Here, we\ndescribe the unprecedented screening of aluminium distribution in catalytically\nactive zeolite SSZ-13 in both its protonated and sodium containing forms,\nH-SSZ-13 and Na-SSZ-13, using density functional theory. We predict violations\nof Lowensteins rule in high and low silica H-SSZ-13 and other protonated\nframeworks considered in this investigation, H-LTA, H-RHO and H-ABW. The\nsynthetic realisation of these zeolites could spur the development of new\ncatalytic routes and materials, and the optimisation of existing zeolite\ncatalysts.\n", "  We have developed numerical simulations of three dimensional suspensions of\nactive particles to characterize the capabilities of the hydrodynamic stresses\ninduced by active swimmers to promote global order and emergent structures in\nactive suspensions. We have considered squirmer suspensions embedded in a fluid\nmodeled under a Lattice Boltzmann scheme. We have found that active stresses\nplay a central role to decorrelate the collective motion of squirmers and that\ncontractile squirmers develop significant aggregates.\n", "  Inspired by some recent works of Lovelock Brans-Dicke gravity and mimetic\ngravity, cosmology solutions in extensions of these two modified gravities are\ninvestigated. A non-local term is added to the Lovelock Brans-Dicke action and\nGauss-Bonnet terms to the mimetic action,correspondingly. De Sitter and power\nscale factor solutions are then obtained in both theories. They can provide\nnatural new approaches to a more accurate description of the unverse evolution.\n", "  This paper is concerned with the dynamics of continua on differentiable\nmanifolds. We present a covariant derivation of equations of motion, viewing\nmotion as a curve in an infinite-dimensional Banach space of embeddings of a\nbody manifold in a space manifold. Our main application is the motion of\nresidually-stressed elastic bodies; residual stress results from a geometric\nincompatibility between body and space manifolds. We then study a particular\nexample of elastic vibrations of a two- dimensional curved annulus embedded in\na sphere.\n", "  DGRAV News: we hear that ...\n  DGRAV program at the APS meeting in Washington D.C.\n  Obituary:\n  Remembering John Stewart\n  Conference Reports:\n  CPT and Lorentz Symmetry\n", "  Physiologically, the thoracic (THO) and abdominal (ABD) movement signals,\ncaptured using wearable piezo-electric bands, provide information about various\ntypes of apnea, including central sleep apnea (CSA) and obstructive sleep apnea\n(OSA). However, the use of piezo-electric wearables in detecting sleep apnea\nevents has been seldom explored in the literature. This study explored the\npossibility of identifying sleep apnea events, including OSA and CSA, by solely\nanalyzing {one or both the THO and ABD signals. An adaptive non-harmonic model\nwas introduced to model the THO and ABD signals, which allows us to design\nfeatures for sleep apnea events. To confirm the suitability of the extracted\nfeatures, a support vector machine was applied to classify three categories --\nnormal and hypopnea, OSA, and CSA. According to a database of} 34 subjects, the\noverall classification accuracies were on average $75.9\\%\\pm 11.7\\%$ and\n$73.8\\%\\pm 4.4\\%$, respectively, based on the cross validation. When the\nfeatures determined from the THO and ABD signals were combined, the overall\nclassification accuracy became $81.8\\%\\pm 9.4\\%$. These features were applied\nfor designing a state machine for online apnea event detection. Two\nevent-by-event accuracy indices, S and I, were proposed for evaluating the\nperformance {of the state machine. For the same database, the} S index was\n$84.01\\%\\pm 9.06\\%$, and the I index was $77.21\\%\\pm 19.01\\%$. The results\nindicate the considerable potential of applying the proposed algorithm to\nclinical examinations for both screening and homecare purposes.\n", "  Observational searches for faint active nuclei at $z > 6$ have been extremely\nelusive, with a few candidates whose high-$z$ nature is still to be confirmed.\nInterpreting this lack of detections is crucial to improve our understanding of\nhigh-$z$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs) formation and growth. In this work,\nwe present a model for the emission of accreting BHs in the X-ray band, taking\ninto account super-Eddington accretion, which can be very common in gas-rich\nsystems at high-$z$. We compute the spectral energy distribution for a sample\nof active galaxies simulated in a cosmological context, which represent the\nprogenitors of a $z \\sim 6$ SMBH with $M_{\\rm BH} \\sim 10^9 \\, M_\\odot$. We\nfind an average Compton thick fraction of $\\sim 45\\%$ and large typical column\ndensities ($N_H \\gtrsim 10^{23} \\rm \\, cm^2$). However, faint progenitors are\nstill luminous enough to be detected in the X-ray band of current surveys. Even\naccounting for a maximum obscuration effect, the number of detectable BHs is\nreduced at most by a factor 2. In our simulated sample, observations of faint\nquasars are mainly limited by their very low active fraction ($f_{\\rm act} \\sim\n1 \\%$), which is the result of short, super-critical growth episodes. We\nsuggest that to detect high-$z$ SMBHs progenitors, large area surveys with\nshallower sensitivities, such as Cosmos Legacy and XMM-LSS+XXL, are to be\npreferred with respect to deep surveys probing smaller fields, such as CDF-S.\n", "  A relativistic 4D string is described in the framework of the covariant\nquantum theory first introduced by Stueckelberg (1941) [1], and further\ndeveloped by Horwitz and Piron (1973) [2], and discussed at length in the book\nof Horwitz (2015) [3]. We describe the space-time string using the solutions of\nrelativistic harmonic oscillator [4]. We first study the problem of the\ndiscrete string, both classically and quantum mechanically, and then turn to a\nstudy of the continuum limit, which contains a basically new formalism for the\nquantization of an extended system. The mass and energy spectrum are derived.\nSome comparison is made with known string models.\n", "  The perfect Planck spectrum of the observed cosmic microwave background\nradiation indicates that our universe must be in thermal equilibrium. The dark\nsector of the universe should also be in the same equilibrium state with dark\nmatter and dark energy coupled to each other and emits gravitational phonon\nblackbody radiation which is the main component of the cosmic background\nradiation. In the radiation-dominated era such gravitational radiation should\nbe the majority species of the cosmic medium. Instead of the ideal fluid\nassumed by the standard cosmological model LCDM, the universe has to be taken\nas a thermodynamic system consisting of gravitationally connected dark energy\nand matter. Besides particle dynamics, statistical thermodynamics is also\nnecessary for understanding the cosmological constitution and evolution\nhistory. As an alternative to LCDM we constructed a dark-energy-matter-coupled\n(DEMC) cosmological model. Based on the relativistic mass-energy relation,\nconservation law of energy, Lagrange's equation with variable potential\nfunction, mean-field theory of continuous phase transition, and the symmetry\nprinciple of the kinetic coefficients, we deduced dynamic equations of the\nexpansion of a DEMC universe with three parameters. These equations reproduce\nthe observed history of the rate of expansion of our universe.\n", "  We describe the phenomenon of generation of an external field of forces from\npiezoelectric materials subjected to the application of electric fields or\nmechanical stress. The piezoelectric materials are shown as being capable of\nproducing induction forces in external objects and we conclude that the nature\nof the forces generated are not originated from the traditional interactions.\nFurther we specifically assert that the generation of forces by the\npiezoelectric materials is ruled by the hypothesis of preexisting condition of\ngeneralized quantum entanglement between the molecular structure of the\nmaterial bulk and the surrounding environment. In addition the widely spread\ncoupling of the molecules with the environment can be manifested from the\nso-called direct effect or the converse effect in piezoelectric materials and\nthis coupling is not intermediated by acoustic waves or electromagnetic fields.\nWe show that the novel effect has a theoretical explanation consistent with the\ngeneralized quantum entanglements and the direction of the induced forces\ndepends on either the direction of the mechanical force or the electric field\napplied in these materials.\n", "  In the present work, we deal with a binary mixture of diluted relativistic\ngases within the framework of the kinetic theory. The analysis is made within\nthe framework of the Boltzmann equation. We assume that the gas is under the\ninfluence of an isotropic Schwarzschild metric and is composed of particles\nwith speeds comparable with the light speed. Taking into account the\nconstitutive equations for the laws of Fourier and Navier-Stokes, we obtain\nexpressions for the thermal conductivity, the shear, and bulk viscosities. To\nevaluate the integrals we assume a hard-sphere interaction along with\nnon-disparate masses for the particles of each component. We show the\nanalytical expressions and the behavior of the transport coeffcients with\nrespect to a relativistic parameter which gives the ratio of the rest energy of\nthe particles to the thermal energy of the gas.We also determine the dependence\nof the transport coeffcients with respect to the gravitational potential and\ndemonstrate that the corresponding one component\n", "  A mathematical model has been developed to simulate the kinetic and thermal\nbehaviour of a porous solid pellet undergoing chemical reaction with a gas. The\nmodel describes the chemical reaction itself, the transfer of the gaseous\nspecies between the external gas and the pellet surface, the transport of these\nspecies to the inside of the pellet through the pores and through the layer of\nsolid reaction products, the generation (or consumption) of heat due to the\nreaction and the associated heat transfer processes, together with the\nstructural changes produced in the solid by the reaction. The model has been\nvalidated by comparison with experimental results and data from the literature.\nSimulation results are presented for two reactions: the exothermal oxidation of\nzinc sulphide and the hydrofluorination of uranium dioxide.\n", "  Energy decay plays a central role in a wide range of phenomena, such as\noptical emission, nuclear fission, and dissipation in quantum systems. Energy\ndecay is usually described as a system leaking energy irreversibly into an\nenvironmental bath. Here, we report on energy decay measurements in\nnanomechanical systems based on multi-layer graphene that cannot be explained\nby the paradigm of a system directly coupled to a bath. As the energy of a\nvibrational mode freely decays, the rate of energy decay switches abruptly to a\nlower value. This finding can be explained by a model where the measured mode\nhybridizes with other modes of the resonator at high energy. Below a threshold\nenergy, modes are decoupled, resulting in comparatively low decay rates and\ngiant quality factors exceeding 1 million. Our work opens up new possibilities\nto manipulate vibrational states, engineer hybrid states with mechanical modes\nat completely different frequencies, and to study the collective motion of this\nhighly tunable system.\n", "  We present an ultrafast all-optical gated amplifier, or transistor,\nconsisting of a forest of ZnO nanowire lasers. A gate light pulse creates a\ndense electron-hole plasma and excites laser action inside the nanowires.\nSource light traversing the nanolaser forest is amplified, partly as it is\nguided through the nanowires, and partly as it propagates diffusively through\nthe forest. We have measured transmission increases at the drain up to a factor\n34 for 385-nm light. Time-resolved amplification measurements show that the\nlasing is rapidly self-quenching, yielding pulse responses as short as 1.2 ps.\n", "  As an exoplanet orbits its host star it reflects and emits light, forming a\ndistinctive phase curve. By observing this light, we can study the atmosphere\nand surface of distant planets. The planets in our Solar System show a wide\nrange of atmospheric phenomena, with stable wind patterns, changing storms, and\nevolving anomalies. Brown dwarfs also exhibit atmospheric variability. Such\ntemporal variability in the atmosphere of a giant exoplanet has not to date\nbeen observed. HAT-P-7 b is an exoplanet with a known offset in the peak of its\nphase curve. Here we present variations in the peak offset ranging between\n-0.086+0.033-0.033 to 0.143+0.040-0.037 in phase, implying that the peak\nbrightness repeatedly shifts from one side of the planet's substellar point to\nthe other. The variability occurs on a timescale of tens to hundreds of days.\nThese shifts in brightness are indicative of variability in the planet's\natmosphere, and result from a changing balance of thermal emission and\nreflected flux from the planet's dayside. We suggest that variation in wind\nspeed in the planetary atmosphere, leading to variable cloud coverage on the\ndayside and a changing energy balance, is capable of explaining the observed\nvariation.\n", "  We measure the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) observables\n$\\hat{d}_\\alpha(z, z_c)$, $\\hat{d}_z(z, z_c)$, and $\\hat{d}_/(z, z_c)$ as a\nfunction of redshift $z$ in the range 0.1 to 0.7 with Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) data release DR13. These observables are independent and satisfy a\nconsistency relation that provides discrimination against miss-fits due to\nbackground fluctuations. From these measurements and the correlation angle\n$\\theta_\\textrm{MC}$ of fluctuations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\nwe obtain $\\Omega_k = -0.015 \\pm 0.030$, $\\Omega_{\\textrm{DE}} + 2.2 \\Omega_k =\n0.717 \\pm 0.004$ and $w_1 = 0.37 \\pm 0.61$ for dark energy density allowed to\nvary as $\\Omega_{\\textrm{DE}}(a) = \\Omega_{\\textrm{DE}} [ 1 + w_1 ( 1 - a)]$.\nWe present measurements of $\\Omega_{\\textrm{DE}}(a)$ at six values of the\nexpansion parameter $a$. Fits with several scenarios and data sets are\npresented. The data is consistent with space curvature parameter $\\Omega_k = 0$\nand $\\Omega_{\\textrm{DE}}(a)$ constant.\n", "  Printed polymer electronics has held for long the promise of revolutionizing\ntechnology by delivering distributed, flexible, lightweight and cost-effective\napplications for wearables, healthcare, diagnostic, automation and portable\ndevices. While impressive progresses have been registered in terms of organic\nsemiconductors mobility, field-effect transistors (FET), the basic building\nblock of any circuit, are still showing limited speed of operation, thus\nlimiting their real applicability. So far, attempts with organic FET to achieve\nthe tens of MHz regime, a threshold for many applications comprising the\ndriving of high resolution displays, have relied on the adoption of\nsophisticated lithographic techniques and/or complex architectures, undermining\nthe whole concept. In this work we demonstrate polymer FETs which can operate\nup to 20 MHz and are fabricated by means only of scalable printing techniques\nand direct-writing methods with a completely mask-less procedure. This is\nachieved by combining a fs-laser process for the sintering of high resolution\nmetal electrodes, thus easily achieving micron-scale channels with reduced\nparasitism down to 0.19 pF mm-1, and a large area coating technique of a high\nmobility polymer semiconductor, according to a simple and scalable process\nflow.\n", "  It is shown that planar topological effective gauge theory with dynamics,\nacquires corrections to angular momentum beyond the well-known topological\nphoton spin, the latter arising from interactions with parity-breaking massive\nfermions. In the non-relativistic limit, a first quantized Schroedinger\nrepresentation is possible where the topological and kinetic terms decouple,\nthe latter contributing to angular momentum and compete with the centrifugal\nbarrier. This results in shallow resonances of Efimov kind, which may be\nverified in planar physical systems.\n", "  Observations of diffuse radio emission in galaxy clusters indicate that\ncosmic-ray electrons are accelerated on $\\sim$Mpc scales. However, protons\nappear to be accelerated less efficiently since their associated hadronic\n$\\gamma$-ray emission has not yet been detected. Inspired by recent\nparticle-in-cell simulations, we study the cosmic-ray production and its\nsignatures under the hypothesis that the efficiency of shock acceleration\ndepends on the Mach number and on the shock obliquity. For this purpose, we\ncombine ENZO cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations with a Lagrangian\ntracer code to follow the properties of the cosmic rays. Our simulations\nsuggest that the distribution of obliquities in galaxy clusters is random to\nfirst order. Quasi-perpendicular shocks are able to accelerate cosmic-ray\nelectrons to the energies needed to produce observable radio emission. However,\nthe $\\gamma$-ray emission is lowered by a factor of a few, $\\sim$3, if\ncosmic-ray protons are only accelerated by quasi-parallel shocks, reducing (yet\nnot entirely solving) the tension with the non-detection of hadronic\n$\\gamma$-ray emission by the \\textit{Fermi}-satellite.\n", "  I present recent and forthcoming works to model the CALIFA HII region using\nphotoionization models. The first results are obtained with ad-hoc models\n(combining parameter determination by model fitting and strong line methods)\nwhile the next ones will use a Genetic Algorithm to fit the observations in a\nmulti-dimensional space.\n", "  Context. Small-scale bright features in the photosphere of the Sun, such as\nfaculae or G-band bright points, appear in connection with small-scale magnetic\nflux concentrations.\n  Aims. Here we report on a new class of photospheric bright points that are\nfree of magnetic fields. So far, these are visible in numerical simulations\nonly. We explore conditions required for their observational detection.\n  Methods. Numerical radiation (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations of the\nnear-surface layers of the Sun were carried out. The magnetic field-free\nsimulations show tiny bright points, reminiscent of magnetic bright points,\nonly smaller. A simple toy model for these non-magnetic bright points (nMBPs)\nwas established that serves as a base for the development of an algorithm for\ntheir automatic detection. Basic physical properties of 357 detected nMBPs were\nextracted and statistically evaluated. We produced synthetic intensity maps\nthat mimic observations with various solar telescopes to obtain hints on their\ndetectability.\n  Results. The nMBPs of the simulations show a mean bolometric intensity\ncontrast with respect to their intergranular surroundings of approximately 20%,\na size of 60-80 km, and the isosurface of optical depth unity is at their\nlocation depressed by 80-100 km. They are caused by swirling downdrafts that\nprovide, by means of the centripetal force, the necessary pressure gradient for\nthe formation of a funnel of reduced mass density that reaches from the\nsubsurface layers into the photosphere. Similar, frequently occurring funnels\nthat do not reach into the photosphere, do not produce bright points.\n  Conclusions. Non-magnetic bright points are the observable manifestation of\nvertically extending vortices (vortex tubes) in the photosphere. The resolving\npower of 4-m-class telescopes, such as the DKIST, is needed for an unambiguous\ndetection of them.\n", "  Graphene mechanical resonators are the ultimate two-dimensional\nnanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) with applications in sensing and signal\nprocessing. While initial devices have shown promising results, an ideal\ngraphene NEMS resonator should be strain engineered, clamped at the edge\nwithout trapping gas underneath, and electrically integratable. In this letter,\nwe demonstrate fabrication and direct electrical measurement of circular SU-8\npolymer-clamped chemical vapor deposition (CVD) graphene drum resonators. The\nclamping increases device yield and responsivity, while providing a cleaner\nresonance spectrum from eliminated edge modes. Furthermore, this resonator is\nhighly strained, indicating its potential in strain engineering for performance\nenhancement.\n", "  Starting in December 2014, Kepler K2 observed Neptune continuously for 49\ndays at a 1-minute cadence. The goals consisted of studying its atmospheric\ndynamics (Simon et al. 2016), detecting its global acoustic oscillations (Rowe\net al., submitted), and those of the Sun, which we report on here. We present\nthe first indirect detection of solar oscillations in intensity measurements.\nBeyond the remarkable technical performance, it indicates how Kepler would see\na star like the Sun. The result from the global asteroseismic approach, which\nconsists of measuring the oscillation frequency at maximum amplitude \"nu_max\"\nand the mean frequency separation between mode overtones \"Delta nu\", is\nsurprising as the nu_max measured from Neptune photometry is larger than the\naccepted value. Compared to the usual reference nu_max_sun = 3100 muHz, the\nasteroseismic scaling relations therefore make the solar mass and radius appear\nlarger by 13.8 +/- 5.8 % and 4.3 +/- 1.9 % respectively. The higher nu_max is\ncaused by a combination of the value of nu_max_sun, being larger at the time of\nobservations than the usual reference from SOHO/VIRGO/SPM data (3160 +/- 10\nmuHz), and the noise level of the K2 time series, being ten times larger than\nVIRGO's. The peak-bagging method provides more consistent results: despite a\nlow signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we model ten overtones for degrees l=0,1,2. We\ncompare the K2 data with simultaneous SOHO/VIRGO/SPM photometry and BiSON\nvelocity measurements. The individual frequencies, widths, and amplitudes\nmostly match those from VIRGO and BiSON within 1 sigma, except for the few\npeaks with lowest SNR.\n", "  We present a local fermion update algorithm for N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills\nquantum mechanics which allows simulations in fixed canonical sectors. We\ndiscuss some aspects of the physics of this theory, including the appearance of\nflat directions in the bosonic potential and the metastabilities related to\nthose. In particular, we show that the modulus of the bosonic fields diverges\nin some of the fermion sectors and for thermal boundary conditions.\n", "  In this review, we present a symmetry-guided strategy that utilizes exact as\nwell as partial symmetries for enabling a deeper understanding of and advancing\nab initio studies for determining the microscopic structure of atomic nuclei.\nThese symmetries expose physically relevant degrees of freedom that, for\nlarge-scale calculations with QCD-inspired interactions, allow the model space\nsize to be reduced through a very structured selection of the basis states to\nphysically relevant subspaces. This can guide explorations of simple patterns\nin nuclei and how they emerge from first principles, as well as extensions of\nthe theory beyond current limitations toward heavier nuclei and larger model\nspaces. This is illustrated for the ab initio symmetry-adapted no-core shell\nmodel (SA-NCSM) and two significant underlying symmetries, the symplectic\nSp(3,R) group and its deformation-related SU(3) subgroup. We review the broad\nscope of nuclei, where these symmetries have been found to play a key role:\nfrom light to intermediate-mass nuclei, based on first-principle explorations;\nthrough the Hoyle state in C-12, within a no-core shell-model perspective; up\nto strongly deformed species of the rare-earth and actinide regions, as\ninvestigated in earlier studies. A complementary picture, driven by symmetries\ndual to Sp(3,R), is also discussed. We briefly review symmetry-guided\ntechniques that prove useful in various nuclear-theory models, such as Elliott\nmodel, ab initio SA-NCSM, symplectic model, pseudo-SU(3) and pseudo-symplectic\nmodels, ab initio hyperspherical harmonics method, ab initio lattice effective\nfield theory, exact pairing-plus-shell model approaches, and cluster models.\nImportant implications of these approaches that have deepened our understanding\nof emergent phenomena in nuclei, such as enhanced collectivity, giant\nresonances, pairing, halo, and clustering, are discussed.\n", "  The SEIS (Seismic Experiment for Interior Structures) instrument onboard the\nInSight mission to Mars is the critical instrument for determining the interior\nstructure of Mars, the current level of tectonic activity and the meteorite\nflux. Meeting the performance requirements of the SEIS instrument is vital to\nsuccessfully achieve these mission objectives. Here we analyse in-situ wind\nmeasurements from previous Mars space missions to understand the wind\nenvironment that we are likely to encounter on Mars, and then we use an elastic\nground deformation model to evaluate the mechanical noise contributions on the\nSEIS instrument due to the interaction between the Martian winds and the\nInSight lander. Lander mechanical noise maps that will be used to select the\nbest deployment site for SEIS once the InSight lander arrives on Mars are also\npresented. We find the lander mechanical noise may be a detectable signal on\nthe InSight seismometers. However, for the baseline SEIS deployment position,\nthe noise is expected to be below the total noise requirement >97% of the time\nand is, therefore, not expected to endanger the InSight mission objectives.\n", "  Stabilization of quantum manifolds is at the heart of error-protected quantum\ninformation storage and manipulation. Nonlinear driven-dissipative processes\nachieve such stabilization in a hardware efficient manner. Josephson circuits\nwith parametric pump drives implement these nonlinear interactions. In this\narticle, we propose a scheme to engineer a four-photon drive and dissipation on\na harmonic oscillator by cascading experimentally demonstrated two-photon\nprocesses. This would stabilize a four-dimensional degenerate manifold in a\nsuperconducting resonator. We analyze the performance of the scheme using\nnumerical simulations of a realizable system with experimentally achievable\nparameters.\n", "  We give a construction of completely integrable ($2n$)-dimensional\nHamiltonian systems with symplectic brackets of the Lie-Poisson type (linear in\ncoordinates) and with quadratic Hamilton functions. Applying to any such system\nthe so called Kahan-Hirota-Kimura discretization scheme, we arrive at a\nbirational ($2n$)-dimensional map. We show that this map is symplectic with\nrespect to a symplectic structure that is a perturbation of the original\nsymplectic structure on $\\mathbb R^{2n}$, and possesses $n$ independent\nintegrals of motion, which are perturbations of the original Hamilton functions\nand are in involution with respect to the invariant symplectic structure. Thus,\nthis map is completely integrable in the Liouville-Arnold sense. Moreover,\nunder a suitable normalization of the original $n$-tuples of commuting vector\nfields, their Kahan-Hirota-Kimura discretizations also commute and share the\ninvariant symplectic structure and the $n$ integrals of motion. This paper\nextends our previous ones, arXiv:1606.08238 [nlin.SI] and arXiv:1607.07085\n[nlin.SI], where similar results were obtained for Hamiltonian systems with a\nconstant (canonical) symplectic structure and cubic Hamilton functions.\n", "  Spin-phonon interactions are central to many interesting phenomena, ranging\nfrom superconductivity to magnetoelectric effects. Yet, they are believed to\nhave a negligible influence on the structural behavior of most materials. For\nexample, magnetic perovskite oxides often undergo structural transitions\naccompanied by magnetic signatures whose minuteness suggests that the\nunderlying spin-phonon couplings are largely irrelevant. Here we present an\nexception to this rule, showing that novel effects can occur as a consequence.\nOur first-principles calculations reveal that spin-phonon interactions are\nessential to reproduce the experimental observations on the phase diagram of\nmagnetoelectric multiferroic BiCoO$_{3}$. Moreover, we predict that, under\ncompression, these couplings lead to an unprecedented temperature-driven\ndouble-reentrant sequence of ferroelectric transitions. We propose how to\nmodify BiCoO$_{3}$ via chemical doping to reproduce such striking effects at\nambient conditions, thereby yielding useful multifunctionality.\n", "  We present the argument that the past limit of the Trautman-Bondi mass is the\nADM mass under weak hypotheses on the decay of the metric towards spatial\ninfinity, without any smallness conditions on the initial data, assuming well\ndefined energy, momentum, center of mass and angular moment. Part of the proof\nconsists of a careful inspection of the proof of stability of Minkowski\nspace-time, which is sketched. This is complemented by an interior gluing\nresult for asymptotically flat initial data with well defined Poincar\\'e\ncharges, which is proved in detail.\n", "  The multiwavelength spectrum of BL Lacertae during its July 1997 outburst is\nanalyzed in terms of different variations of the homogeneous leptonic jet model\nfor the production of high-energy radiation from blazars. We find that a\ntwo-component gamma-ray spectrum, consisting of a synchrotron self-Compton and\nan external Compton component, is required in order to yield an acceptable fit\nto the broadband spectrum. Our analysis indicates that in BL Lac, unlike other\nBL Lac objects, the broad emission line region plays an important role for the\nhigh-energy emission. Several alternative blazar jet models are briefly\ndiscussed. In the appendix, we describe the formalism in which the process of\nComptonization of reprocessed accretion disk photons is treated in the\npreviously developed blazar jet simulation code which we use.\n"]}
