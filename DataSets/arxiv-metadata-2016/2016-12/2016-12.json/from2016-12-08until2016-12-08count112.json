As an illustration of the new representation, we\nreexamine the imaginary-time Green's functions of single-band Hubbard model in\nthe framework of dynamical mean-field theory. The calculated results suggest\nthat with carefully chosen integral kernels the Gibbs oscillations found in\nprevious orthogonal polynomial representation have been suppressed vastly and\nremarkable corrections to the measured Green's functions have been obtained.\n", "  We introduce the MathGR package, written in Mathematica. The package can\nmanipulate tensor and GR calculations with either abstract or explicit indices,\nsimplify tensors with permutational symmetries, decompose tensors from abstract\nindices to partially or completely explicit indices and convert partial\nderivatives into total derivatives. Frequently used GR tensors and a model of\nFRW universe with ADM type perturbations are predefined. The package is built\naround the philosophy to \"keep it simple\", and makes use of latest tensor\ntechnologies of Mathematica.\n", "  Vortices are essential to angular momentum in quantum systems such as\nultracold atomic gases. The existence of quantized vorticity in bosonic systems\nstimulated the development of the Gross-Pitaevskii mean-field approximation.\nHowever, the true dynamics of angular momentum in finite, interacting many-body\nsystems like trapped Bose-Einstein condensates is enriched by the emergence of\nquantum correlations whose description demands more elaborate methods. Herein\nwe theoretically investigate the full many-body dynamics of the acquisition of\nangular momentum by a gas of ultracold bosons in two dimensions using a\nstandard rotation procedure. We demonstrate the existence of a novel mode of\nquantized vorticity, which we term the $\\textit{phantom vortex}$ that, contrary\nto the conventional mean-field vortex, can be detected as a topological defect\nof spatial coherence, but $\\textit{not}$ of the density. We describe previously\nunknown many-body mechanisms of vortex nucleation and show that angular\nmomentum is hidden in phantom vortex modes which so far seem to have evaded\nexperimental detection.\n", "  A new qualitative stringlike picture for mesons is proposed which leads to a\nsimple and intuitively clear generalization of linear radial Regge trajectories\nto the case of massive quarks. The obtained universal relation is successfully\ntested in the sector of unflavored vector mesons, where many radial excitations\nare known. Some new predictions are given. Our results suggest that the quark\nmasses can be easily estimated from the spectra of radially excited mesons.\n", "  The observation of galaxy and gas distributions, as well as cosmological\nsimulations in a $\\Lambda$CDM Universe, suggests that clusters of galaxies are\nstill accreting mass and are not expected to be in equilibrium. In this work,\nwe investigate the possibility to evaluate the departure from virial\nequilibrium in order to detect, in that balance, effects from a Dark\nMatter--Dark Energy interaction. We continue, from previous works, using a\nsimple model of interacting dark sector, the Layzer--Irvine equation for\ndynamical virial evolution, and employ optical observations in order to obtain\nthe mass profiles through weak lensing and X-ray observations giving the\nintracluster gas temperatures. Through a Monte Carlo method, we generate, for a\nset of clusters, measurements of observed virial ratios, interaction strength,\nrest virial ratio and departure from equilibrium factors. We found a compounded\ninteraction strength of $-1.99^{+2.56}_{-16.00}$, compatible with no\ninteraction, but also a compounded rest virial ratio of $-0.79 \\pm 0.13$, which\nwould entail a $2\\sigma$ detection. We confirm quantitatively that clusters of\ngalaxies are out of equilibrium but further investigation is needed to\nconstrain a possible interaction in the dark sector.\n", "  We review the TeV scale $B-L$ extension of the Minimal Supersymmetric\nStandard Model (BLSSM) where an inverse seesaw mechanism of light neutrino mass\ngeneration is naturally implemented and concentrate on its hallmark\nmanifestations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\n", "  In this work, we investigate the discrete spectrum generated by complex\nmatrix-valued perturbations for a class of 2D and 3D Pauli operators with\nnonconstant magnetic fields. We establish a simple criterion for the potentials\nto produce discrete spectrum near the low ground energy of the operators.\nMoreover, in case of creation of nonreal eigenvalues, this criterion specifies\nalso their location.\n", "  An inconsistency of quantum field theory, regarding the signs of vacuum\nenergy and vacuum pressure of elementary fields versus non-elementary fields\n(like e.g. phonon fields), is pointed out. An improved law for the canonical\nquantization of fields is presented, which is based on the distinction between\nelementary and non-elementary fields. Remarkably, the improved quantization\nmethod removes not only the inconsistency of quantum field theory, but at the\nsame time solves the (old) cosmological constant problem for all fields of the\nstandard model of elementary particles (but not for the hypothetical inflaton\nfields), without compromising any of the achievements of established quantum\nfield theory.\n", "  This Letter presents measurements of correlated production of nearby jets in\nPb+Pb collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}} = 2.76$ TeV using the ATLAS\ndetector at the Large Hadron Collider. The measurement was performed using 0.14\n${\\rm nb}^{-1}$ of data recorded in 2011. The production of correlated jet\npairs was quantified using the rate, $R_{\\Delta R}$, of \"neighbouring\" jets\nthat accompany \"test\" jets within a given range of angular distance, $\\Delta\nR$, in the pseudorapidity--azimuthal angle plane. The jets were measured in the\nATLAS calorimeter and were reconstructed using the anti-$k_{t}$ algorithm with\nradius parameters $d = 0.2$, $0.3$, and $0.4$. $R_{\\Delta R}$ was measured in\ndifferent Pb+Pb collision centrality bins, characterized by the total\ntransverse energy measured in the forward calorimeters. A centrality dependence\nof $R_{\\Delta R}$ is observed for all three jet radii with $R_{\\Delta R}$ found\nto be lower in central collisions than in peripheral collisions. The ratios\nformed by the $R_{\\Delta R}$ values in different centrality bins and the values\nin the 40-80 % centrality bin are presented.\n", "  The aim of this work is to explore the discrete spectrum generated by complex\nperturbations in $L^{2}(\\mathbb{R}^3,\\mathbb{C}^4)$ of the $3d$ Dirac operator\n$\\alpha \\cdot (-i\\nabla - \\textbf{A}) + m \\beta$ with variable magnetic field.\nHere, $\\alpha := (\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3)$ and $\\beta$ are $4 \\times 4$\nDirac matrices, and $m > 0$ is the mass of a particle. We give a simple\ncriterion for the potentials to generate discrete spectrum near $\\pm m$. In the\ncase of creation of non-real eigenvalues, this criterion gives also their\nlocation.\n", "  A direct search for lepton-flavour-violating (LFV) $H\\to\\mu\\tau$ decays of\nthe recently discovered Higgs boson with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is\npresented. The analysis is performed in the $H\\to\\mu\\tau_{\\mathrm{had}}$\nchannel, where $\\tau_{\\mathrm{had}}$ is a hadronically decaying $\\tau$-lepton.\nThe search is based on the data sample of proton--proton collisions collected\nby the ATLAS experiment corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20.3\nfb$^{-1}$ at a centre-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV. No statistically\nsignificant excess of data over the predicted background is observed. The\nobserved (expected) 95% confidence-level upper limit on the branching fraction,\nBr($H\\to\\mu\\tau$), is 1.85% (1.24%).\n", "  We study the squeezing of output quadratures of an electro-magnetic field\nescaping from a resonator coupled to a general quantum system with arbitrary\ninteraction strengths. The generalized theoretical analysis of output squeezing\nproposed here is valid for all the interaction regimes of cavity-quantum\nelectrodynamics: from the weak to the strong, ultrastrong, and deep coupling\nregimes. For coupling rates comparable or larger then the cavity resonance\nfrequency, the standard input-output theory for optical cavities fails to\ncalculate the correct output field-quadratures and predicts a non-negligible\namount of output squeezing, even if the system is in its ground state. Here we\nshow that, for arbitrary interactions and cavity-embedded quantum systems, no\nsqueezing can be found in the output-field quadratures if the system is in its\nground state. We also apply the proposed theoretical approach to study the\noutput squeezing produced by: (i) an artificial two-level atom embedded in a\ncoherently-excited cavity; and (ii) a cascade-type three-level system\ninteracting with a cavity field mode. In the latter case the output squeezing\narises from the virtual photons of the atom-cavity dressed states. This work\nextends the possibility of predicting and analyzing continuous-variable optical\nquantum-state tomography when optical resonators interact very strongly with\nother quantum systems.\n", "  We describe the Quantum Test of the Equivalence principle and Space Time\n(QTEST), a concept for an atom interferometry mission on the International\nSpace Station (ISS). The primary science objective of the mission is a test of\nEinstein's equivalence principle with two rubidium isotope gases at a precision\nof better than 10$^{-15}$. Distinct from the classical tests is the use of\nquantum wave packets and their expected large spatial separation in the QTEST\nexperiment. This dual species atom interferometer experiment will also be\nsensitive to time-dependent equivalence principle violations that would be\nsignatures for ultralight dark-matter particles. In addition, QTEST will be\nable to perform photon recoil measurements to better than 10$^{-11}$ precision.\nThis improves upon terrestrial experiments by a factor of 100, enabling an\naccurate test of the standard model of particle physics and contributing to\nmass measurement, in the proposed new international system of units (SI), with\nsignificantly improved precision. The predicted high measurement precision of\nQTEST comes from the microgravity environment on ISS, offering extended free\nfall times in a well-controlled environment. Suppression of systematic errors\nby use of symmetric interferometer configurations and rejection of common-mode\nerrors drives the QTEST design. It uses Bragg interferometry with a single\nlaser beam at the \"magic\" wavelength, where the two isotopes have the same\npolarizability, for mitigating sensitivities to vibrations and laser noise,\nimaging detection for correcting cloud initial conditions and maintaining\ncontrast, modulation of the atomic hyperfine states for reduced sensitivity to\nmagnetic field gradients, two source regions for simultaneous time reversal\nmeasurements and redundancy, and modulation of the gravity vector using a\nrotating platform to reduce otherwise difficult systematics to below\n10$^{-16}$.\n", "  Cavity-optomechanical systems realized in single-crystal diamond are poised\nto benefit from its extraordinary material properties, including low mechanical\ndissipation and a wide optical transparency window. Diamond is also rich in\noptically active defects, such as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) and silicon-vacancy\n(SiV) centers, which behave as atom-like systems in the solid state.\nPredictions and observations of coherent coupling of the NV electronic spin to\nphonons via lattice strain has motivated the development of diamond\nnanomechanical devices aimed at realization of hybrid quantum systems, in which\nphonons provide an interface with diamond spins. In this work, we demonstrate\ndiamond optomechanical crystals (OMCs), a device platform to enable such\napplications, wherein the co-localization of ~ 200 THz photons and few to 10\nGHz phonons in a quasi-periodic diamond nanostructure leads to coupling of an\noptical cavity field to a mechanical mode via radiation pressure. In contrast\nto other material systems, diamond OMCs operating in the resolved-sideband\nregime possess large intracavity photon capacity (> 10$^5$) and sufficient\noptomechanical coupling rates to reach a cooperativity of ~ 20 at room\ntemperature, allowing for the observation of optomechanically induced\ntransparency and the realization of large amplitude optomechanical\nself-oscillations.\n", "  (Abridged) The trajectory of Saturn is nowadays known at essentially the same\naccuracy level of the inner planets due to the telemetry of the Cassini\nspacecraft. Thus, the expected perturbations $\\dot\\varpi,~\\dot\\Omega$ due to\nPX, for which we suggest the name Telisto in view of its remarkable distance,\non the Kronian apsidal and draconitic orbital motions are theoretically\ninvestigated to tentatively constrain the configuration space of Telisto/Planet\nNine itself. To this aim, we compare our predictions\n$\\dot\\varpi_\\textrm{theo},~\\dot\\Omega_\\textrm{theo}$ to the currently available\nexperimental intervals of values\n$\\Delta\\dot\\Omega_\\textrm{obs},~\\Delta\\dot\\varpi_\\textrm{obs}$ determined by\nastronomers in the recent past without explicitly modeling and solving for PX\nitself. As such, our results, despite being plausible and in agreement to a\nlarge extent with other constraints released in the literature, should be\nregarded as proof-of-principle investigations aimed to encourage more accurate\nanalyses in future. It turns out that the admissible region in its\nconfiguration space is moderately narrow as far as its position along its\norbit, reckoned by the true anomaly $f_\\textrm{X}$, is concerned, being\nconcentrated around approximately $130~\\textrm{deg}\\lesssim\nf_\\textrm{X}\\lesssim 240~\\textrm{deg}$. Telisto/Planet Nine is certainly far\nfrom its perihelion ($f_\\textrm{X}=0~\\textrm{deg}$), in agreement with other\nrecent studies. The future analysis of the data from the ongoing New Horizons\nmission might be helpful in further constraining the scenario considered here\nfor Telisto/Planet Nine. Its impact on the spaceraft's range over a multi-year\nspan is investigated with a preliminary sensitivity analysis.\n", "  Electromotility of outer hair cells (OHCs) has been extensively studied with\nin vitro experiments because of its physiological significance in the cochlear\namplifier, which provides the exquisite sensitivity and frequency selectivity\nof the mammalian ear. However, these studies have been performed largely under\nload-free conditions or with static load, while these cells function in vivo in\na dynamic environment, receiving electrical energy to enhance mechanical\noscillation in the inner ear. This gap leaves uncertainties in addressing a key\nissue, how much mechanical energy an OHC provides. The present report is an\nattempt of bridging the gap by introducing a simple one-dimensional model for\nelectromotility of OHC in a dynamic environment. This model incorporates a\nfeedback loop involving the receptor potential and the mechanical load on OHC,\nand leads to an analytical expression for the membrane capacitance, which\nexplicitly describes the dependence on the elastic load, viscous drag, and the\nmass. The derived equation of motion was examined in a mass-less model system\nwith realistic parameter values for OHC. It was found that viscous drag is more\neffective than elastic load in enhancing the receptor potential that drives the\ncell. For this reason, it is expected that OHCs are more effective in\ncounteracting viscous drag than providing elastic energy to the system.\n", "  In this paper, we study the restoration of gauge symmetry and up to half the\nsupersymmetry (N=(2,0) or N=(1,1) in two dimensions) for N=2 non-Abelian\nChern-Simons theories in the presence of a boundary. We describe the boundary\naction which is a supersymmetric WZW model coupled to the bulk Chern-Simons\ntheory. Unlike the N=1 case, higher supersymmetry (N=(2,0)) will endow the\ngroup manifold of the WZW model with a complex structure. Therefore, the\nN=(2,0) WZW model in our paper is constructed via a coset space $G_c/G$, where\n$G$ is the same as the gauge group in the Chern-Simons action.\n", "  Classical wave fields are real-valued, ensuring the wave states at opposite\nfrequencies and momenta to be inherently identical. Such a particle-hole\nsymmetry can open up new possibilities for topological phenomena in classical\nsystems. Here we show that the historically studied two-dimensional (2D)\nmagnetoplasmon, which bears gapped bulk states and gapless one-way edge states\nnear zero frequency, is topologically analogous to the 2D topological $p+\\Ii p$\nsuperconductor with chiral Majorana edge states and zero modes. We further\npredict a new type of one-way edge magnetoplasmon at the interface of opposite\nmagnetic domains, and demonstrate the existence of zero-frequency modes bounded\nat the peripheries of a hollow disk. These findings can be readily verified in\nexperiment, and can greatly enrich the topological phases in bosonic and\nclassical systems.\n", "  Quantum-mechanical devices have the potential to transform cryptography. Most\nresearch in this area has focused either on the information-theoretic\nadvantages of quantum protocols or on the security of classical cryptographic\nschemes against quantum attacks. In this work, we initiate the study of another\nrelevant topic: the encryption of quantum data in the computational setting.\n  In this direction, we establish quantum versions of several fundamental\nclassical results. First, we develop natural definitions for private-key and\npublic-key encryption schemes for quantum data. We then define notions of\nsemantic security and indistinguishability, and, in analogy with the classical\nwork of Goldwasser and Micali, show that these notions are equivalent. Finally,\nwe construct secure quantum encryption schemes from basic primitives. In\nparticular, we show that quantum-secure one-way functions imply IND-CCA1-secure\nsymmetric-key quantum encryption, and that quantum-secure trapdoor one-way\npermutations imply semantically-secure public-key quantum encryption.\n", "  The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) is a radio interferometer\naiming to detect the power spectrum of 21 cm fluctuations from neutral hydrogen\nfrom the Epoch of Reionization (EOR). Drawing on lessons from the Murchison\nWidefield Array (MWA) and the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of\nReionization (PAPER), HERA is a hexagonal array of large (14 m diameter) dishes\nwith suspended dipole feeds. Not only does the dish determine overall\nsensitivity, it affects the observed frequency structure of foregrounds in the\ninterferometer. This is the first of a series of four papers characterizing the\nfrequency and angular response of the dish with simulations and measurements.\nWe focus in this paper on the angular response (i.e., power pattern), which\nsets the relative weighting between sky regions of high and low delay, and\nthus, apparent source frequency structure. We measure the angular response at\n137 MHz using the ORBCOMM beam mapping system of Neben et al. We measure a\ncollecting area of 93 m^2 in the optimal dish/feed configuration, implying\nHERA-320 should detect the EOR power spectrum at z~9 with a signal-to-noise\nratio of 12.7 using a foreground avoidance approach with a single season of\nobservations, and 74.3 using a foreground subtraction approach. Lastly we study\nthe impact of these beam measurements on the distribution of foregrounds in\nFourier space.\n", "  Condition for distinguishability of countably infinite number of pure states\nby a single measurement is given. Distinguishability is to be understood as\npossibility of an unambiguous measurement. For finite number of states, it is\nknown that the necessary and sufficient condition of distinguishability is that\nthe states are linearly independent. For infinite number of states, several\nnatural classes of distinguishability can be defined. We give a necessary and\nsufficient condition for a system of pure states to be distinguishable. It\nturns out that each level of distinguishability naturally corresponds to one of\nthe generalizations of linear independence to families of infinite vectors. As\nan important example, we apply the general theory to von Neumann's lattice, a\nsubsystem of coherent states which corresponds to a lattice in the classical\nphase space. We prove that the condition for distinguishability is that the\narea of the fundamental region of the lattice is greater than the Planck\nconstant, and also find subtle behavior on the threshold. These facts reveal\nthe measurement theoretical meaning of the Planck constant and give a\njustification for the interpretation that it is the smallest unit of area in\nthe phase space. The cases of uncountably many states and of mixed states are\nalso discussed.\n", "  To measure the last unknown $3\\nu$ oscillation parameter ($\\delta$), several\nlong baseline neutrino experiments have been designed or proposed. Recently it\nhas been shown that turning on neutral current Non-Standard Interactions (NSI)\nof neutrinos with matter can induce degeneracies that may even hinder the\nproposed state-of-the-art DUNE long baseline experiment from measuring the\nvalue of $\\delta$. We study how the result of the proposed MOMENT experiment\nwith a baseline of 150 km and $200~{\\rm MeV}<E_\\nu<600~{\\rm MeV}$ can help to\nsolve the degeneracy induced by NSI and determine the true value of $\\delta$.\n", "  The [111]-oriented InAs/GaSb and GaSb/InAs core-shell nanowires have been\nstudied by the $8\\times 8$ Luttinger-Kohn $\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{p}$ Hamiltonian to\nsearch for non-vanishing fundamental gaps between inverted electron and hole\nbands. We focus on the variations of the topologically nontrivial fundamental\ngap, the hybridization gap, and the effective gap with the core radius and\nshell thickness of the nanowires. The evolutions of all the energy gaps with\nthe structural parameters are shown to be dominantly governed by quantum size\neffects. With a fixed core radius, a topologically nontrivial fundamental gap\nexists only at intermediate shell thicknesses. The maximum gap is $\\sim 4.4$\nmeV for GaSb/InAs and $\\sim 3.5$ meV for InAs/GaSb core-shell nanowires, and\nfor the GaSb/InAs core-shell nanowires the gap persists over a wider range of\ngeometrical parameters. The intrinsic reason for these differences between the\ntwo types of nanowires is that in the shell the electron-like states of InAs is\nmore delocalized than the hole-like state of GaSb, while in the core the\nhole-like state of GaSb is more delocalized than the electron-like state of\nInAs, and both features favor stronger electron-hole hybridization. Since\nsimilar features of the electron- and hole-like states have been found in\nnanowires of other materials, it could serve as a common rule to put the\nhole-like state in the core while the electron-like state in the shell of a\ncore-shell nanowire to achieve better topological properties.\n", "  In this work the supersymmetric technique is applied to the truncated\noscillator to generate Hamiltonians ruled by second and third-order polynomial\nHeisenberg algebras, which are connected to the Painlev\\'e IV and Painlev\\'e V\nequations respectively. The aforementioned connection is exploited to produce\nparticular solutions to both non-linear differential equations and the\nB\\\"acklund transformations relating them.\n", "  We propose a spectroscopic method to identify the nodal gap structure in\nunconventional superconductors. This method best suits for locating the\nhorizontal line node and for pinpointing the isolated point nodes by measuring\npolar angle ($\\theta$) resolved zero energy density of states $N(\\theta)$. This\nis measured by specific heat or thermal conductivity at low temperatures under\na magnetic field. We examine a variety of uniaxially symmetric nodal structure,\nincluding point and/or line nodes with linear and quadratic dispersions, by\nsolving Eilenberger equation in vortex states. It is found that (A) the maxima\nof $N(\\theta)$ continuously shift from the anti-nodal to the nodal direction\n($\\theta_{\\rm n}$) as a field increases accompanying the oscillation pattern\nreversal at low and high fields. Furthermore, (B) local minima emerge next to\n$\\theta_{\\rm n}$ on both sides except for the case of linear point node. These\nfeatures are robust and detectable experimentally. Experimental results of\n$N(\\theta)$ performed on several superconductors, UPd$_2$Al$_3$, URu$_2$Si$_2$,\nCu$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$, and UPt$_3$, are examined and commented in light of the\npresent theory.\n", "  We formulate a pseudofermion functional renormalization group (PFFRG) scheme\nto address frustrated quantum magnetism in three dimensions. In a scenario\nwhere many numerical approaches fail due to sign problem or small system size,\nthree-dimensional (3D) PFFRG allows for a quantitative investigation of the\nquantum spin problem and its observables. We illustrate 3D PFFRG for the simple\ncubic $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet, and benchmark it\nagainst other approaches, if available.\n", "  In the same manner that free-space propagation and curved glass lenses are\nused to shape the spatial properties of light, a combination of chromatic\ndispersion and devices known as time lenses may be used to reshape its temporal\nproperties. These techniques have found extensive application in classical\noptical signal processing based on nonlinear optics. A new set of challenges\npresents itself when processing quantum signals, including noise suppression\nand high fidelity requirements. In this work, we construct a single-photon time\nlens based on dispersion and nonlinear sum-frequency generation to image the\nspectral waveform of half of an entangled photon pair. We find that the joint\nspectrum of the photon pair has strongly negative frequency correlations before\nthe time lens and strongly positive correlations afterwards, verifying that the\nprocess has an overall negative spectro-temporal magnification. The temporal\nimaging of energy-time entangled systems opens up a host of new possible\ntechniques for distinctly quantum tasks in the frequency domain, including\nstate engineering, and our results demonstrate that the upconversion time lens\nis an essential part of the single-photon waveform manipulation toolkit.\n", "  We theoretically investigate the interplay between the confinement length $L$\nand the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\\Lambda$ to optimize the thermoelectric\npower factor of semiconducting materials. An analytical formula for the power\nfactor is derived based on the one-band model assuming nondegenerate\nsemiconductors to describe quantum effects on the power factor of the low\ndimensional semiconductors. The power factor is enhanced for one- and\ntwo-dimensional semiconductors when $L$ is smaller than $\\Lambda$ of the\nsemiconductors. In this case, the low-dimensional semiconductors having $L$\nsmaller than their $\\Lambda$ will give a better thermoelectric performance\ncompared to their bulk counterpart. On the other hand, when $L$ is larger than\n$\\Lambda$, bulk semiconductors may give a higher power factor compared to the\nlower dimensional ones.\n", "  We analyze noise properties of time series of frequency data from different\ncounting modes of a Keysight 53230A frequency counter. We use a 10 MHz\nreference signal from a passive hydrogen maser connected via phase-stable\nHuber+Suhner Sucoflex 104 cables to the reference and input connectors of the\ncounter. We find that the high resolution gap-free (CONT) frequency counting\nprocess imposes long-term correlations in the output data, resulting in a\nmodified Allan deviation that is characteristic of random walk phase noise.\nEqually important, the CONT mode results in a frequency bias. In contrast, the\ncounter's undocumented raw continuous mode (RCON) yields unbiased frequency\nstability estimates with white phase noise characteristics, and of a magnitude\nconsistent with the counter's 20 ps single-shot resolution. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that a 100-point running average filter in conjunction with the\nRCON mode yields resolution enhanced frequency estimates with flicker phase\nnoise characteristics. For instance, the counter's built-in moving-average\nfunction can be used. The improved noise characteristics of the averaged RCON\nmode versus the CONT mode imply that the former mode yields frequency estimates\nwith improved confidence for a given measurement time.\n", "  Apples, porcupines, and the most obscure Bob Dylan song---is every topic a\nfew clicks from Philosophy? Within Wikipedia, the surprising answer is yes:\nnearly all paths lead to Philosophy. Wikipedia is the largest, most\nmeticulously indexed collection of human knowledge ever amassed. More than\ninformation about a topic, Wikipedia is a web of naturally emerging\nrelationships. By following the first link in each article, we algorithmically\nconstruct a directed network of all 4.7 million articles: Wikipedia's First\nLink Network. Here, we study the English edition of Wikipedia's First Link\nNetwork for insight into how the many articles on inventions, places, people,\nobjects, and events are related and organized.\n  By traversing every path, we measure the accumulation of first links, path\nlengths, groups of path-connected articles, and cycles. We also develop a new\nmethod, traversal funnels, to measure the influence each article exerts in\nshaping the network. Traversal funnels provides a new measure of influence for\ndirected networks without spill-over into cycles, in contrast to traditional\nnetwork centrality measures. Within Wikipedia's First Link Network, we find\nscale-free distributions describe path length, accumulation, and influence. Far\nfrom dispersed, first links disproportionately accumulate at a few\narticles---flowing from specific to general and culminating around fundamental\nnotions such as Community, State, and Science. Philosophy directs more paths\nthan any other article by two orders of magnitude. We also observe a\ngravitation towards topical articles such as Health Care and Fossil Fuel. These\nfindings enrich our view of the connections and structure of Wikipedia's ever\ngrowing store of knowledge.\n", "  In models with extended Higgs sectors, it is possible that the Higgs boson\ndiscovered at the LHC is not the lightest one. We show that in a realistic\nmodel (the Type I 2-Higgs Doublet Model), when the sum of the masses of a light\nscalar and a pseudoscalar ($h$ and $A$) is smaller than the $Z$ boson mass, the\nElectroweak (EW) production of an $hA$ pair can dominate over QCD production by\norders of magnitude, a fact not previously highlighted. This is because in the\n$gg$-initiated process, $hA$ production via a resonant $Z$ in the $s$-channel\nis prohibited according to the Landau-Yang theorem, which is not the case for\nthe $q\\bar{q}$-initiated process. We explore the parameter space of the model\nto highlight regions giving such $hA$ solutions while being consistent with all\nconstraints from collider searches, $b$-physics and EW precision data. We also\nsingle out a few benchmark points to discuss their salient features, including\nthe $hA$ search channels that can be exploited at Run II of the LHC.\n", "  Data from the MINOS experiment has been used to search for mixing between\nmuon neutrinos and muon antineutrinos using a time-independent\nLorentz-violating formalism derived from the Standard-Model Extension (SME).\nMINOS is uniquely capable of searching for muon neutrino-antineutrino mixing\ngiven its long baseline and ability to distinguish between neutrinos and\nantineutrinos on an event-by-event basis. Neutrino and antineutrino\ninteractions were observed in the MINOS Near and Far Detectors from an exposure\nof 10.56$\\times10^{20}$ protons-on-target from the NuMI neutrino-optimized\nbeam. No evidence was found for such transitions and new, highly stringent\nlimits were placed on the SME coefficients governing them. We place the first\nlimits on the SME parameters $(c_{L})^{TT}_{\\mu\\mu} $ and\n$(c_{L})^{TT}_{\\tau\\tau}$ at $-8.4\\times10^{-23} < (c_{L})^{TT}_{\\mu\\mu} <\n8.0\\times10^{-23}$ and $-8.0\\times10^{-23} < (c_{L})^{TT}_{\\tau\\tau} <\n8.4\\times10^{-23}$, and the world's best limits on the\n$\\tilde{g}^{ZT}_{\\mu\\overline{\\mu}}$ and $\\tilde{g}^{ZT}_{\\tau\\overline{\\tau}}$\nparameters at $|\\tilde{g}^{ZT}_{\\mu\\overline{\\mu}}| < 3.3\\times 10^{-23}$ and\n$|\\tilde{g}^{ZT}_{\\tau\\overline{\\tau}}| < 3.3\\times 10^{-23}$, all limits\nquoted at $3\\sigma$.\n", "  Tightly confined modes of light, as in optical nanofibers or photonic crystal\nwaveguides, can lead to large optical coupling in atomic systems, which\nmediates long-range interactions between atoms. These one-dimensional systems\ncan naturally possess couplings that are asymmetric between modes propagating\nin different directions. Strong long-range interaction among atoms via these\nmodes can drive them to a self-organized periodic distribution. In this paper,\nwe examine the self-organizing behavior of atoms in one dimension coupled to a\nchiral reservoir. We determine the solution to the equations of motion in\ndifferent parameter regimes, relative to both the detuning of the pump laser\nthat initializes the atomic dipole-dipole interactions and the degree of\nreservoir chirality. In addition, we calculate possible experimental signatures\nsuch as reflectivity from self-organized atoms and motional sidebands.\n", "  We show that applying the Bailey lemma to elliptic hypergeometric integrals\non the $A_n$ root system leads to a large web of dualities for $\\mathcal{N} =\n1$ supersymmetric linear quiver theories. The superconformal index of Seiberg's\nSQCD with $SU(N_c)$ gauge group and $SU(N_f)\\times SU(N_f)\\times U(1)$ flavour\nsymmetry is equal to that of $N_f-N_c-1$ distinct linear quivers. Seiberg\nduality further enlarges this web by adding new quivers. In particular, both\ninteracting electric and magnetic theories with arbitrary $N_c$ and $N_f$ can\nbe constructed by quivering an $s$-confining theory with $N_f=N_c+1$.\n", "  Uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analyses are a vital component for\npredictive modeling in the sciences and engineering. The adjoint approach to\nsensitivity analysis requires solving a primary system of equations and a\nmathematically related set of adjoint equations. The information contained in\nthe equations can be combined to produce sensitivity information in a\ncomputationally efficient manner. In this work, sensitivity analyses are\nperformed on systems described by flux-limited radiative diffusion using the\nadjoint approach. The sensitivities computed are shown to agree with standard\nperturbation theory, and can be obtained in significantly less computational\ntime.\n", "  We study the scattering of a light particle on a bound pair of heavy\nparticles (e.g., the deuteron) within the fixed center approximation in the\ncase of light-heavy attraction, solving the integral equation for the\nthree-body Green's function both in the coordinate and in the momentum space.\nThe results for the three-body scattering amplitude appear to be ambiguous --\nthey depend on a single real parameter. This parameter may be fixed by a\nthree-body input, e.g., the three-body scattering length. We also solve the\nintegral equation for the three-body Green function in the momentum space,\nintroducing a finite cut-off. We show that all three approaches are equivalent.\nWe also discuss how our approach to the problem matches with the introduction\nof three-body contact interaction as done by other authors.\n", "  Two-photon time-resolved photoluminescence has been recently applied to\nvarious semiconductor devices to determine carrier lifetime and surface\nrecombination velocities. So far the theoretical modeling activity has been\nmainly limited to the commonly used one-photon counterpart of the technique.\nHere we provide the analytical solution to a 3D diffusion equation that\ndescribes two-photon microscopy in the low-injection regime. We focus on a\nsystem with a single buried interface with enhanced recombination, and analyze\nhow transport, bulk and surface recombinations influence photoluminescence\ndecays. We find that bulk measurements are dominated by diffusion at short\ntimes and by bulk recombination at long times. Surface recombination modifies\nbulk signals when the optical spot is less than a diffusion length away from\nthe probed interface. In addition, the resolution is increased as the spot size\nis reduced, which however makes the signal more sensitive to diffusion.\n", "  We report on the observation of subcycle interferences of electron wave\npackets released during the strong field ionization of H$_2$ with cycle-shaped\ntwo-color laser fields. With a reaction microscope, channel-resolved\nphotoelectron momentum distribution are obtained for different final products\noriginating from single ionization of H$_2$. Our results show that the subcycle\ninterference structures of electron wave packet are very sensitive to the\ncycle-shape of the two-color laser field. The reason is that the ionization\ntime within an optical cycle is determined by the cycle-shape of the laser\nfield. The subcycle interference structures can be further used to get the\nsubcycle dynamics of molecules during strong field interaction.\n", "  In this paper we consider an alternative approach to \"un-reduction\". This is\nthe process where one associates to a Lagrangian system on a manifold a\ndynamical system on a principal bundle over that manifold, in such a way that\nsolutions project. We show that, when written in terms of second-order ordinary\ndifferential equations (SODEs), one may associate to the first system a (what\nwe have called) \"primary un-reduced SODE\", and we explain how all other\nun-reduced SODEs relate to it. We give examples that show that the considered\nprocedure exceeds the realm of Lagrangian systems and that relate our results\nto those in the literature.\n", "  In the light of the recent results concerning CMB observations and GW\ndetection we address the question of whether it is possible, in a\nself-consistent inflationary framework, to simultaneously generate a spectrum\nof scalar metric perturbations in agreement with Planck data and a stochastic\nbackground of primordial gravitational radiation compatible with the design\nsensitivity of aLIGO/Virgo and/or eLISA. We suggest that this is possible in a\nstring cosmology context, for a wide region of the parameter space of the\nso-called pre-big bang models. We also discuss the associated values of the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio relevant to the CMB polarization experiments. We\nconclude that future, cross-correlated results from CMB observations and GW\ndetectors will be able to confirm or disprove pre-big bang models and -- in any\ncase -- will impose new significant constraints on the basic string\ntheory/cosmology parameters.\n", "  Quantum message authentication codes are families of keyed encoding and\ndecoding maps that enable the detection of tampering on encoded quantum data.\nHere, we study a new class of simulators for quantum message authentication\nschemes, and show how they are applied in the context of two codes: the\nClifford and the trap code. Our results show for the first time that these\ncodes admit an efficient simulation (assuming that the adversary is efficient).\nSuch efficient simulation is typically crucial in order to establish a\ncomposable notion of security.\n", "  We propose a new mechanism for thermal dark matter freezeout, termed\nCo-Decaying Dark Matter. Multi-component dark sectors with degenerate particles\nand out-of-equilibrium decays can co-decay to obtain the observed relic\ndensity. The dark matter density is exponentially depleted through the decay of\nnearly degenerate particles, rather than from Boltzmann suppression. The relic\nabundance is set by the dark matter annihilation cross-section, which is\npredicted to be boosted, and the decay rate of the dark sector particles. The\nmechanism is viable in a broad range of dark matter parameter space, with a\nrobust prediction of an enhanced indirect detection signal. Finally, we present\na simple model that realizes co-decaying dark matter.\n", "  A generalized version of the fidelity susceptibility of single-band and\nmulti-orbital Hubbard models is systematically studied using single-site\ndynamical mean-field theory in combination with a hybridization expansion\ncontinuous-time quantum Monte Carlo impurity solver. We find that the fidelity\nsusceptibility is extremely sensitive to changes in the state of the system. It\ncan be used as a numerically inexpensive tool to detect and characterize a\nbroad range of phase transitions and crossovers in Hubbard models, including\n(orbital-selective) Mott metal-insulator transitions, high-spin to low-spin\ntransitions, Fermi-liquid to non-Fermi-liquid crossovers, and spin-freezing\ncrossovers.\n", "  Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study the heavy quark potential and the\njet quenching parameter in the near horizon limit of D3-D(-1) background. The\nresults are compared with those of conformal cases. It is shown that the\npresence of instantons tends to suppress the heavy quark potential and enhance\nthe jet quenching parameter.\n", "  We propose a scheme for coupling 2D materials to an engineered cavity based\non a defective rod type photonic crystal lattice. We show results from\nnumerical modelling of the suggested cavity design, and propose using the\nheight profile of a 2D material transferred on top of the cavity to maximise\ncoupling between exciton recombination and the cavity mode. The photonic\nstructure plays a key role in enhancing the launch efficiency, by improving the\ndirectionality of the emitted light to better couple it into an external\noptical system. When using the photonic structure, we measured an increase in\nthe extraction ratio by a factor of 3.4. We investigated the variations in the\nflux spectrum when the radius of the rods is modified, and when the 2D material\ndroops to a range of different heights within the cavity. We found an optimum\nenhancement when the rods have a radius equal to 0.165 times the lattice\nconstant, this enhancement reduces when the radius is reduced or increased.\nFinally, we discuss the possible use of solid immersion lenses, in combination\nwith our photonic structure, to further enhance the launch efficiency and to\nimprove vertical confinement of the cavity mode.\n", "  The interplay between structure and dynamics in non-equilibrium steady-state\nis far from understood. We address this interplay by tracking Brownian Dynamics\ntrajectories of particles in a binary colloid of opposite charges in an\nexternal electric field, undergoing cross-over from homogeneous to lane state,\na prototype of heterogeneous structure formation in non-equilibrium systems. We\nshow that the length scale of structural correlations controls heterogeneity in\ndiffusion and consequent anomalous dynamic responses, like the exponential tail\nin probability distributions of particle displacements and stretched\nexponential structural relaxation. We generalise our observations using\nequations for steady state density which may aid to understand microscopic\nbasis of heterogeneous diffusion in condensed matter systems.\n", "  One of the central ideas regarding anomalies in topological phases of matter\nis that they imply the existence of higher-dimensional physics, with an anomaly\nin a D-dimensional theory typically being cancelled by a bulk (D+1)-dimensional\nsymmetry-protected topological phase (SPT). We demonstrate that for some\ntopological phases with reflection symmetry, anomalies may actually be\ncancelled by a D-dimensional SPT, provided that it comes embedded in an\notherwise trivial (D+1)-dimensional bulk. We illustrate this for the example of\n$\\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological order enriched with reflection symmetry in (2+1)D,\nand along the way establish a classification of anomalous reflection symmetry\nfractionalization patterns. In particular, we show that anomalies occur if and\nonly if both electric and magnetic quasiparticle excitations possess nontrivial\nfractional reflection quantum numbers.\n", "  Motivated by the possible existence of other universes, with different values\nfor the fundamental constants, this paper considers stellar models in universes\nwhere $^8$Be is stable. Many previous authors have noted that stars in our\nuniverse would have difficulty producing carbon and other heavy elements in the\nabsence of the well-known $^{12}$C resonance at 7.6 MeV. This resonance is\nnecessary because $^8$Be is unstable in our universe, so that carbon must be\nproduced via the triple alpha reaction to achieve the requisite abundance.\nAlthough a moderate change in the energy of the resonance (200 -- 300 keV) will\nindeed affect carbon production, an even smaller change in the binding energy\nof beryllium ($\\sim100$ keV) would allow $^8$Be to be stable. A stable isotope\nwith $A=8$ would obviate the need for the triple alpha process in general, and\nthe $^{12}$C resonance in particular, for carbon production. This paper\nexplores the possibility that $^8$Be can be stable in other universes. Simple\nnuclear considerations indicate that bound states can be realized, with binding\nenergy $\\sim0.1-1$ MeV, if the fundamental constants vary by a $\\sim {\\rm\nfew}-10$ percent. In such cases, $^8$Be can be synthesized through helium\nburning, and $^{12}$C can be produced later through nuclear burning of\nberyllium. This paper focuses on stellar models that burn helium into\nberyllium; once the universe in question has a supply of stable beryllium,\ncarbon production can take place during subsequent evolution in the same star\nor in later stellar generations. Using both a semi-analytic stellar structure\nmodel as well as a state-of-the-art stellar evolution code, we find that viable\nstellar configurations that produce beryllium exist over a wide range of\nparameter space. Finally, we demonstrate that carbon can be produced during\nlater evolutionary stages.\n", "  Date City in Fukushima Prefecture has conducted a population-wide individual\ndose monitoring program after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant\nAccident, which provides a unique and comprehensive data set of the individual\ndoses of citizens. The purpose of this paper, the first in the series, is to\nestablish a method for estimating effective doses based on the available\nambient dose rate survey data. We thus examined the relationship between the\nindividual external doses and the corresponding ambient doses assessed from\nairborne surveys. The results show that the individual doses were about 0.15\ntimes the ambient doses, the coefficient of 0.15 being a factor of 4 smaller\nthan the value employed by the Japanese government, throughout the period of\nthe airborne surveys used. The method obtained in this study could aid in the\nprediction of individual doses in the early phase of future radiological\naccidents involving large-scale contamination.\n", "  We report on the emergence of robust superconducting order in single crystal\nalloys of 2H-TaSe$_{2-x}$S$_{x}$ (0$\\leq$x$\\leq$2) . The critical temperature\nof the alloy is surprisingly higher than that of the two end compounds\nTaSe$_{2}$ and TaS$_{2}$. The evolution of superconducting critical temperature\nT$_{c} (x)$ correlates with the full width at half maximum of the Bragg peaks\nand with the linear term of the high temperature resistivity. The conductivity\nof the crystals near the middle of the alloy series is higher or similar than\nthat of either one of the end members 2H-TaSe$_{2}$ and/or 2H-TaS$_{2}$. It is\nknown that in these materials superconductivity (SC) is in close competition\nwith charge density wave (CDW) order. We interpret our experimental findings in\na picture where disorder tilts this balance in favor of superconductivity by\ndestroying the CDW order.\n", "  We show that natural supersymmetry can be embedded in a five-dimensional\ntheory with supersymmetry breaking \\`a la Scherk-Schwarz (SS). There is no\n'gluino-sucks' problem for stops localized in the four-dimensional brane and\ngluinos propagating in the full five-dimensional bulk, and sub-TeV stops are\neasily accommodated. The $\\mu / B_\\mu$ problem is absent as well; the SS\nbreaking generates a Higgsino Dirac mass and no bilinear Higgs mass parameter\nin the superpotential is required. Moreover, for non-maximal SS twists leading\nto $\\tan \\beta \\simeq 1$, the Higgs spectrum is naturally split, in agreement\nwith LHC data. The 125-GeV Higgs mass and radiative electroweak symmetry\nbreaking can be accommodated by minimally extending the Higgs sector with $Y=0$\n$SU(2)_L$ triplets.\n", "  Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are one of the most important tools for\nstudying interacting quantum many-body systems. The vast majority of QMC\ncalculations in interacting fermion systems require a constraint to control the\nsign problem. The constraint involves an input trial wave function which\nrestricts the random walks. We introduce a systematically improvable constraint\nwhich relies on the fundamental role of the density or one-body density matrix.\nAn independent-particle calculation is coupled to an auxiliary-field QMC\ncalculation. The independent-particle solution is used as the constraint in\nQMC, which then produces the input density or density matrix for the next\niteration. The constraint is optimized by the self-consistency between the\nmany-body and independent-particle calculations. The approach is demonstrated\nin the two-dimensional Hubbard model by accurately determining the ground state\nwhen collective modes separated by tiny energy scales are present in the\nmagnetic and charge correlations. Our approach also provides an ab initio way\nto predict effective interaction parameters for independent-particle\ncalculations.\n", "  We explore dynamics of cosmological models with bounce solutions evolving on\na spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker background. We consider\ncosmological models that contain the Hilbert-Einstein curvature term, the\ninduced gravity term with a negative coupled constant, and even polynomial\npotentials of the scalar field. Bounce solutions with non-monotonic Hubble\nparameters have been obtained and analyzed. The case when the scalar field has\nthe conformal coupling and the Higgs-like potential with an opposite sign is\nstudied in detail. In this model the evolution of the Hubble parameter of the\nbounce solution essentially depends on the sign of the cosmological constant.\n", "  By using a sum rule approach we investigate the transition between the\nhydrodynamic and the collisionless regime of the collective modes in a 1D\nharmonically trapped Bose gas. Both the weakly interacting gas and the\nTonks-Girardeau limits are considered. We predict that the excitation of the\ndipole compression mode is characterized, in the high temperature collisionless\nregime, by a beating signal of two different frequencies ($\\omega_z$ and\n$3\\omega_z$) while, in the high temperature collisional regime, the excitation\nconsists of a single frequency ($\\sqrt{7}\\omega_z$). This behaviour differs\nfrom the case of the lowest breathing mode whose excitation consists of a\nsingle frequency ($2\\omega_z$) in both regimes. Our predictions for the dipole\ncompression mode open promising perspectives for the experimental investigation\nof collisional effects in 1D configurations.\n", "  This paper discusses the effect that conformal symmetry can have on a charged\nwormhole. The analysis yields a physical interpretation of the conformal factor\nin terms of the electric charge. The rate of change of the conformal factor\ndetermines much of the outcome, which ranges from having no solution to\nwormholes having either one or two throats.\n", "  We recently showed how it is possible to use a cubic Galileon action to\nconstruct classical cosmological solutions that enter a contracting null energy\ncondition (NEC) violating phase, bounce at finite values of the scale factor\nand exit into an expanding NEC-satisfying phase without encountering any\nsingularities or pathologies. A drawback of these examples is that singular\nbehavior is encountered at some time either just before or just after the\nNEC-violating phase. In this Letter, we show that it is possible to circumvent\nthis problem by extending our method to actions that include the next order\n${\\cal L}_4$ Galileon interaction. Using this approach, we construct\nnon-singular classical bouncing cosmological solutions that are\nnon-pathological for all times.\n", "  Shannon Entropy has been extensively used for characterizing complexity of\ntime series arising from chaotic dynamical systems and stochastic processes\nsuch as Markov chains. However, for short and noisy time series, Shannon\nentropy performs poorly. Complexity measures which are based on lossless\ncompression algorithms are a good substitute in such scenarios. We evaluate the\nperformance of two such Compression-Complexity Measures namely Lempel-Ziv\ncomplexity ($LZ$) and Effort-To-Compress ($ETC$) on short time series from\nchaotic dynamical systems in the presence of noise. Both $LZ$ and $ETC$\noutperform Shannon entropy ($H$) in accurately characterizing the dynamical\ncomplexity of such systems. For very short binary sequences (which arise in\nneuroscience applications), $ETC$ has higher number of distinct complexity\nvalues than $LZ$ and $H$, thus enabling a finer resolution. For two-state\nergodic Markov chains, we empirically show that $ETC$ converges to a steady\nstate value faster than $LZ$. Compression-Complexity Measures are promising for\napplications which involve short and noisy time series.\n", "  Granular media take on great importance in industry and geophysics, posing a\nsevere challenge to materials science. Their response properties elude known\nsoft rheological models, even when the yield-stress discontinuity is blurred by\nvibro-fluidization. Here we propose a broad rheological scenario where average\nstress sums up a frictional contribution, generalizing conventional\n$\\mu(I)$-rheology, and a kinetic collisional term dominating at fast\nfluidization. Our conjecture fairly describes a wide series of experiments in a\nvibrofluidized vane setup, whose phenomenology includes velocity weakening,\nshear thinning, a discontinuous thinning transition, and gaseous shear\nthickening. The employed setup gives access to dynamic fluctuations, which\nexhibit a broad range of timescales. In the slow dense regime the frequency of\ncage-opening increases with stress and enhances, with respect to\n$\\mu(I)$-rheology, the decrease of viscosity. Diffusivity is exponential in the\nshear stress in both thinning and thickening regimes, with a huge growth near\nthe transition.\n", "  Quantum information processing provides remarkable advantages over its\nclassical counterpart. Quantum optical systems are proved to be sufficient for\nrealizing general quantum tasks, which however often rely on single photon\nsources. In practice, imperfect single photon sources, such as weak coherent\nstate source, are used instead, which will inevitably limit the power in\ndemonstrating quantum effects. For instance, with imperfect photon sources, the\nkey rate of the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol will be very low, which\nfortunately can be resolved by utilizing the decoy state method. As a\ngeneralization, we investigate an efficient way to simulate single photons with\nimperfect ones to an arbitrary desired accuracy when the number of photonic\ninputs is small. Based on this simulator, we can thus replace the tasks that\ninvolve only a few single photon inputs with the ones that only make use of\nimperfect photon sources. In addition, our method also provides a quantum\nsimulator to quantum computation based on quantum optics. In the main context,\nwe take phase randomized coherent state as an example for analysis. A general\nphoton source applies similarly and may provide some further advantages for\ncertain tasks.\n", "  The Lab\\'ik and Smith Monte Carlo simulation technique to implement the Widom\nparticle insertion method is applied using Molecular Dynamics (MD) instead to\ncalculate numerically the insertion probability, $P_0(\\eta,\\sigma_0)$, of\ntracer hard-sphere (HS) particles of different diameters, $\\sigma_0$, in a host\nHS fluid of diameter $\\sigma$ and packing fraction, $\\eta$, up to $0.5$. It is\nshown analytically that the only polynomial representation of $-\\ln\nP_0(\\eta,\\sigma_0)$ consistent with the limits $\\sigma_0\\to 0$ and\n$\\sigma_0\\to\\infty$ has necessarily a cubic form,\n$c_0(\\eta)+c_1(\\eta)\\sigma_0/\\sigma+c_2(\\eta)(\\sigma_0/\\sigma)^2+c_3(\\eta)(\\sigma_0/\\sigma)^3$.\nOur MD data for $-\\ln P_0(\\eta,\\sigma_0)$ are fitted to such a cubic polynomial\nand the functions $c_0(\\eta)$ and $c_1(\\eta)$ are found to be statistically\nindistinguishable from their exact solution forms. Similarly, $c_2(\\eta)$ and\n$c_3(\\eta)$ agree very well with the\nBoubl\\'ik-Mansoori-Carnahan-Starling-Leland and\nBoubl\\'ik-Carnahan-Starling-Kolafa formulas. The cubic polynomial is\nextrapolated (high density) or interpolated (low density) to obtain the\nchemical potential of the host fluid, or $\\sigma_{0}\\to\\sigma$, as\n$\\beta\\mu^{\\text{ex}}=c_0+c_1+c_2+c_3$. Excellent agreement between the\nCarnahan-Starling and Carnahan-Starling-Kolafa theories with our MD data is\nevident.\n", "  We derive corrections to atomic energy levels from disformal couplings in\nGalileon theories. Through Bayesian inference, we constrain the cutoff radii\nand Galileon scale via these corrections. To connect different atomic systems,\nwe assume the various cutoff radii related by a one-parameter family of\nsolutions. This introduces a new parameter $\\alpha$ which is also constrained.\nIn this model, we predict shifts to muonic helium of $\\delta\nE_{He^3}=1.97^{+9.28}_{-1.87}$ meV and $\\delta E_{He^4}=1.69^{+9.25}_{-1.61}$\nmeV as well as for true muonium, $\\delta E_{TM}=0.06^{+0.46}_{-0.05}$ meV.\n", "  PSR\\,J1723$-$2837 is a \"redback\" millisecond pulsar (MSP) with a low-mass\ncompanion in a 14.8\\,h orbit. The system's properties closely resemble those of\n\"transitional\" MSPs that alternate between spin-down and accretion-powered\nstates. In this paper we report on long-term photometry of the 15.5\\,mag\ncompanion to the pulsar. We use our data to illustrate that the star\nexperiences sporadic activity, which we attribute to starspots. We also find\nthat the companion is not tidally locked and infer $P_{\\rm s}/P_{\\rm b}=\n0.9974(7)$ for the ratio between the rotational and orbital periods. Finally,\nwe place constraints on various parameters, including the irradiation\nefficiency and pulsar mass. We discuss similarities with other redback MSPs and\nconclude that starspots may provide the most likely explanation for the often\nseen irregular and asymmetric optical lightcurves.\n", "  We experimentally and theoretically investigate the dynamics of\nmicroresonator-based frequency comb generation assisted by mode coupling in the\nnormal group-velocity dispersion (GVD) regime. We show that mode coupling can\ninitiate intracavity modulation instability (MI) by directly perturbing the\npump-resonance mode. We also observe the formation of a low-noise comb as the\npump frequency is tuned further into resonance from the MI point. We determine\nthe phase-matching conditions that accurately predict all the essential\nfeatures of the MI and comb spectra, and extend the existing analogy between\nmode coupling and high-order dispersion to the normal GVD regime. We discuss\nthe applicability of our analysis to the possibility of broadband comb\ngeneration in the normal GVD regime.\n", "  We study the electron-electron interaction effects on topological phase\ntransitions by the ab-initio quantum Monte Carlo simulation. We analyze\ntwo-dimensional class A topological insulators and three-dimensional Weyl\nsemimetals with the long-range Coulomb interaction. The direct computation of\nthe Chern number shows the electron-electron interaction modifies or\nextinguishes topological phase transitions.\n", "  We develop a theory of quantum rational decision making in the tradition of\nAnscombe and Aumann's axiomatisation of preferences on horse lotteries. It is\nessentially the Bayesian decision theory generalised to the space of Hermitian\nmatrices. Among other things, this leads us to give a representation theorem\nshowing that quantum complete rational preferences are obtained by means of\nexpected utility considerations.\n", "  We study two-sided static wormholes with an exact Killing symmetry that\ntranslates both mouths of the wormhole toward the future. This differs from the\nfamiliar Kruskal wormhole whose time translation is future-directed only in one\nasymptotic region and is instead past-directed in the other. Our spacetimes are\nsolutions to Einstein-Hilbert gravity sourced by scalar domain walls. Explicit\nexamples are found in the thin wall approximation. More generally, we show that\nsuch spacetimes can arise in the presence of scalar fields with potentials that\nare $C^1$ but not $C^2$ and find examples numerically. However, solutions with\nan exact such Killing symmetry are forbidden when the scalar potential is\nsmooth. Finally, we consider the mutual information of boundary regions\nassociated with such wormholes in AdS/CFT. Although the interior of our\nsolutions are unstable, we find that even mutual informations between opposite\nboundaries are already thermalized at any finite $t$ in the sense that they\nagree with the $t\\rightarrow \\infty$ limit of results from the familiar\nAdS-Kruskal solution.\n", "  Percolation has long served as a model for diverse phenomena and systems. The\npercolation transition, that is, the formation of a giant cluster on a\nmacroscopic scale, is known as one of the most robust continuous transitions.\nRecently, however, many abrupt percolation transitions have been observed in\ncomplex systems. To illustrate such phenomena, considerable effort has been\nmade to introduce models and construct theoretical frameworks for explosive,\ndiscontinuous, and hybrid percolation transitions. Experimental results have\nalso been reported. In this review article, we describe such percolation\nmodels, their critical behaviors and universal features, and real-world\nphenomena.\n", "  In the last decade, several ultra faint objects (UFOs, $M_V\\gtrsim-3.5$) have\nbeen discovered in the outer halo of the Milky Way. For some of these objects\nit is not clear whether they are star clusters or (ultra-faint) dwarf galaxies.\nIn this work we quantify the contribution of star clusters to the population of\nUFOs. We extrapolated the mass and Galactocentric radius distribution of the\nglobular clusters using a population model, finding that the Milky Way contains\nabout $3.3^{+7.3}_{-1.6}$ star clusters with $M_V\\gtrsim-3.5$ and\nGalactocentric radius $\\geq20\\,$kpc. To understand whether dissolving clusters\ncan appear as UFOs, we run a suite of direct $N$-body models, varying the\norbit, the Galactic potential, the binary fraction and the black hole (BH)\nnatal kick velocities. In the analyses, we consider observational biases such\nas: luminosity limit, field stars, and line-of-sight projection. We find that\nstar clusters contribute to both the compact and the extended population of\nUFOs: clusters without BHs appear compact with radii $\\sim5\\,$pc, while\nclusters that retain their BHs after formation have radii $\\gtrsim20\\,$pc. The\nproperties of the extended clusters are remarkably similar to those of dwarf\ngalaxies: high inferred mass-to-light ratios due to binaries; binary properties\nmildly affected by dynamical evolution; no observable mass segregation; and\nflattened stellar mass function. We conclude that the slope of the stellar mass\nfunction as a function of Galactocentric radius and the presence/absence of\ncold streams can discriminate between DM free and DM dominated UFOs.\n", "  Qudi is a general, modular, multi-operating system suite written in Python 3\nfor controlling laboratory experiments. It provides a structured environment by\nseparating functionality into hardware abstraction, experiment logic and user\ninterface layers. The core feature set comprises a graphical user interface,\nlive data visualization, distributed execution over networks, rapid prototyping\nvia Jupyter notebooks, configuration management, and data recording. Currently,\nthe included modules are focused on confocal microscopy, quantum optics and\nquantum information experiments, but an expansion into other fields is possible\nand encouraged. Qudi is available from https://github.com/Ulm-IQO/qudi and is\nfreely useable under the GNU General Public Licence.\n", "  Physicists have discovered a novel topological semimetal, the Weyl semimetal,\nwhose surface features a non-closed Fermi surface while the low energy\nquasiparticles in the bulk emerge as Weyl fermions. Here they share a brief\nreview of the development and present perspectives on the next step forward.\n", "  Second degree polynomial Heisenberg algebras are realized through the\nharmonic oscillator Hamiltonian, together with two deformed ladder operators\nchosen as the third powers of the standard annihilation and creation operators.\nThe corresponding solutions to the Painleve IV equation are easily found.\nMoreover, three different sets of eigenstates of the deformed annihilation\noperator are constructed, called the good, the bad and the ugly coherent\nstates. Some physical properties of such states will be as well studied.\n", "  We show how conformal field theory topological defects can relate solutions\nof open string field theory for different boundary conditions. To this end we\ngeneralize the results of Graham and Watts to include the action of defects on\nboundary condition changing fields. Special care is devoted to the general case\nwhen nontrivial multiplicities arise upon defect action. Surprisingly the\nfusion algebra of defects is realized on open string fields only up to a (star\nalgebra) isomorphism.\n", "  We investigate the effect of non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on the\nformation of binary stars using a suite of three-dimensional smoothed particle\nmagnetohydrodynamics simulations of the gravitational collapse of one solar\nmass, rotating, perturbed molecular cloud cores. Alongside the role of Ohmic\nresistivity, ambipolar diffusion and the Hall effect, we also examine the\neffects of magnetic field strength, orientation and amplitude of the density\nperturbation. When modelling sub-critical cores, ideal MHD models do not\ncollapse whereas non-ideal MHD models collapse to form single protostars. In\nsuper-critical ideal MHD models, increasing the magnetic field strength or\ndecreasing the initial density perturbation amplitude decreases the initial\nbinary separation. Strong magnetic fields initially perpendicular to the\nrotation axis suppress the formation of binaries and yield discs with magnetic\nfields ~10 times stronger than if the magnetic field was initially aligned with\nthe rotation axis. When non-ideal MHD is included, the resulting discs are\nlarger and more massive, and the binary forms on a wider orbit. Small\ndifferences in the super-critical cores caused by non-ideal MHD effects are\namplified by the binary interaction near periastron. Overall, the non-ideal\neffects have only a small impact on binary formation and early evolution, with\nthe initial conditions playing the dominant role.\n", "  Energy resolution is an important figure of merit for TES microcalorimeter.\nWe propose a laser system to measure the energy resolution of TES\nmicrocalorimeter with a 1550 nm laser source. Compared to method that\ncharacterizes the performance by irradiating the detector using X-ray photons\nfrom a radioactive source placed inside the refrigerator, our system is safer\nand more convenient. The feasibility of this system has been demonstrated in\nthe measurement of an Al/Ti bilayer TES microcalorimeter. In this experiment,\nthe tested detector showed a energy resolution of 72 eV in the energy range\nfrom 0.2 keV to 0.9 keV\n", "  We apply the Monte Carlo Wave Packet (MCWP) approach to investigate the\nkinetic energy release (KER) spectra of the protons following double ionization\nin H$_{2}$ when interacting with laser pulses with central wavelengths ranging\nfrom the near-IR (800 nm) to the mid-IR (6400 nm) regions and with durations of\n3-21 laser cycles. We uncover the physical origins of the peaks in the nuclear\nKER spectra and ascribe them to mechanisms such as ionization following a\nresonant dipole transition, charge-resonance-enhanced ionization (CREI) and\nionization in the dissociative limit of large internuclear distances. For\nrelatively large pulse durations, i.e., for 15 or more laser cycles at 3200 nm\nand 10 or more at 6400 nm, it is possible for the nuclear wave packet in\nH$_{2}^{+}$ to reach very large separations. Ionization of this part of the\nwave packet results in peaks in the KER spectra with very low energies. These\npeaks give direct information about the dissociative energy in the\n$2p\\sigma_{u}$ potential energy curve of H$_{2}^{+}$ at the one- and\nthree-photon resonances between the $2p\\sigma_{u}$ and $1s\\sigma_{g}$ curves in\nH$_{2}^{+}$. With the MCWP approach, we perform a trajectory analysis of the\ncontributions to the KER peaks and identify the dominant ionization pathways.\nFinally, we consider a pump-probe scheme by applying two delayed pulses to\ntrack the nuclear dynamics in a time-resolved setting. Low-energy peaks appear\nfor large delays and these are used to obtain the $2p\\sigma_{u}$ dissociative\nenergy values at the one-photon resonance between the $2p\\sigma_{u}$ and\n$1s\\sigma_{g}$ curves in H$_{2}^{+}$ for different wavelengths.\n", "  A survey of physical parameters and of a ladder of various regimes of\nlaser-matter interactions at extreme intensities is given. Special emphases is\nmade on three selected topics: (i) qualitative derivation of the scalings for\nprobability rates of the basic processes; (ii) self-sustained cascades (which\nmay dominate at the intensity levels attainable with next generation laser\nfacilities); and (iii) possibility of breaking down the Intense Field QED\napproach for ultrarelativistic electrons and high-energy photons at certain\nintensity level.\n", "  We generate photon pairs in a-Si:H microrings using a CW pump, and find the\nKerr coefficient of a-Si:H to be $3.73 \\pm 0.25 \\times 10^{-17}m^2/W$. By\nmeasuring the Q factor with coupled power we find that the loss in the a-Si:H\nmicro-rings scales linearly with power, and therefore cannot originate from two\nphoton absorption. Theoretically comparing a-Si:H and c-Si micro-ring pair\nsources, we show that the high Kerr coefficient of this sample of a-Si:H is\nbest utilized for microrings with Q factors below $10^3$, but that for higher Q\nfactor devices the photon pair rate is greatly suppressed due to the first\norder loss.\n", "  We propose a systematic and explicit method for the inverse engineering of\nthe dynamics of an open quantum systems with no auxiliary Hamiltonian nor the\nprerequisite of adiabatic passage. In particular, we exploit the Lindblad\ndissipators in order to create a resource state or subspace of interest in the\npresence of decoherence. In a conceptual shift, the Lindblad dissipators,\nincluding multiple interactions that are central to determine the steady state\nin the long-time limit for an open quantum system, can be guided to produce a\nuseful practical resource to achieve an arbitrary target state or subspace.\nMore importantly, with the help of gate and circuit-based quantum control, we\nprovide an explicit, programmable, and polynomially efficient control sequence\nto create a cluster state or graph state useful for one-way quantum computing.\n", "  We analyze the electromagnetic field of a short relativistic electron beam\npropagating in a round, hollow dielectric channel. We show that if the beam\npropagates with an offset relative to the axis of the channel, in a steady\nstate, its electromagnetic field outside of the channel extends to large radii\nand carries an energy that scales as the Lorentz factor $\\gamma$ squared (in\ncontrast to the scaling $\\ln\\gamma$ without the channel). When this energy is\nconverted into a terahertz pulse and focused on a target, the electric field in\nthe focus can greatly exceed typical values of the field that are currently\nachieved by sending beams through thin metallic foils.\n", "  We review status and prospects of searches for the charged Higgs boson of\n2-Higgs Doublet Models of all Yukawa types at the Large Hadron Collider\n", "  The single-pulse spectrum of self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) free\nelectron lasers (FELs) is characterized by random fluctuations in frequency.\nThe typical spectrum bandwidth for a hard x-ray FEL is in the range of 10-20 eV\nand is comparable with the distance between energy levels of valence electrons\nin atoms an molecules. We calculate the rate of transitions in a quantum\nthree-level system with the energy difference of several eV caused by such\nradiation and show that for x-ray intensities in the range of $10^{20}$\nW/cm$^2$ the probability of the transition over the duration of the x-ray pulse\nis large. We argue that this effect can be used to modify the spectrum of a\nSASE FEL potentially making it more narrow.\n", "  We employ a time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation to study the evolution of a\n$c\\bar c$ dipole in a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Medium effects on the\nheavy-quark potential in the QGP are found to significantly affect the\ntimescales of the internal evolution of the dipole. Color-screening can enhance\nthe overlap of the expanding wavepackage with excited states at high\ntemperature, while it is reduced at lower temperatures where the dipole favors\nthe formation of the charmonium ground state. We investigate the consequences\nof this mechanism on the double ratio of charmonium nuclear modification\nfactors, $R_{AA}^{\\psi(2S)}/R_{AA}^{J/\\psi}$, in heavy-ion collisions. The\nimpact of the transition mechanisms on this ratio turns out to be rather\nsensitive to the attractive strength of the potential, and to its temperature\ndependence.\n", "  The influence of finite size effects, choice of statistical ensemble and\ncontribution of the forces in numerical simulations using the dissipative\nparticle dynamics (DPD) model are revisited here. Finite size effects in stress\nanisotropy, interfacial tension and dynamic viscosity are computed and found to\nbe minimal with respect to other models. Additionally, the choice of ensemble\nis found to be of fundamental importance for the accurate calculation of\nproperties such as the solvation pressure, especially for relatively small\nsystems. Lastly, the contribution of the random, dissipative and conservative\nforces that make up the DPD model in the prediction of properties of simple\nliquids such as the pressure is studied as well. Some tricks of the trade are\nprovided, which may be useful for those carrying out high-performance numerical\nsimulations using the DPD model.\n", "  Graphene plasmonics has become a highlighted research area due to the\noutstanding properties of deep-subwavelength plasmon excitation, long\nrelaxation time, and electro-optical tunability. Although the giant\nconductivity of a graphene layer enables the low-dimensional confinement of\nlight, the atomic scale of the layer thickness is severely mismatched with\noptical mode sizes, which impedes the efficient tuning of graphene plasmon\nmodes from the degraded light-graphene overlap. Inspired by gap plasmon modes\nin noble metals, here we propose low-dimensional graphene gap plasmon waves for\nlarge light-graphene overlap factor. We show that gap plasmon waves exhibit\nsuperior in-plane and out-of-plane field concentrations on graphene compared to\nthose of edge or wire-like graphene plasmons. By adjusting the chemical\nproperty of the graphene layer, efficient and linear modulation of graphene gap\nplasmon modes is also achieved. Our results provide potential opportunities to\nlow-dimensional graphene plasmonic devices with strong tunability.\n", "  On-chip holographic video is a convenient way to monitor biological samples\nsimultaneously at high spatial resolution and over a wide field-of-view.\nHowever, due to the limited readout rate of digital detector arrays, one often\nfaces a tradeoff between the per-frame pixel count and frame rate of the\ncaptured video. In this report, we propose a subsampled phase retrieval (SPR)\nalgorithm to overcome the spatial-temporal trade-off in holographic video.\nCompared to traditional phase retrieval approaches, our SPR algorithm uses over\nan order of magnitude less pixel measurements while maintaining suitable\nreconstruction quality. We use an on-chip holographic video setup with pixel\nsub-sampling to experimentally demonstrate a factor of 5.5 increase in sensor\nframe rate while monitoring the in vivo movement of Peranema microorganisms.\n", "  We experimentally demonstrate that the bandwidth of single photons laser\npulse is compressed by a factor of 58 in a periodically poled lithium niobate\n(PPLN) waveguide chip. A chirped single photons laser pulse and an oppositely\nchirped classical laser pulse are employed to produce a narrowband single\nphoton pulse with new frequency through sum-frequency generation. In our\nexperiment, the frequency and bandwidth of single photons at 1550 nm are\nsimultaneously converted. Our results mark a critical step towards the\nrealization of coherent photonic interface between quantum communication at\n1550 nm and quantum memory in the near-visible window.\n", "  The Kossel interferences generated by characteristic x-ray lines produced\ninside a periodic multilayer have been observed upon proton irradiation, by\nsubmitting a Cr/B4C/Sc multilayer stack to 2 MeV protons and observing the\nintensity of the Sc and Cr K$\\alpha$ characteristic emissions as a function of\nthe detection angle. When this angle is close to the Bragg angle corresponding\nto the emission wavelength and period of the multilayer, an oscillation of the\nmeasured intensity is detected. The results are in good agreement with a model\nbased on the reciprocity theorem. The combination of the Kossel measurements\nand their simulation, will be a useful tool to obtain a good description of the\nmultilayer stack and thus to study nanometer-thick layers and their interfaces.\n", "  ASTRI SST-2M is one of the prototypes of the small size class of telescopes\nproposed for the Cherenkov Telescope Array. Its optical design is based on a\ndual-mirror Schwarzschild-Couder configuration, and the camera is composed by a\nmatrix of monolithic multipixel silicon photomultipliers managed by ad-hoc\ntailored front-end electronics. This paper describes the procedures for the\ngain calibration on the ASTRI SST-2M. Since the SiPM gain depends on the\noperative voltage and the temperature, we adjust the operative voltages for all\nsensors to have equal gains at a reference temperature. We then correct gain\nvariations caused by temperature changes by adjusting the operating voltage of\neach sensor. For that purpose the SiPM gain dependence on operating voltage and\non temperature have been measured. In addition, we present the calibration\nprocedures and the results of the experimental measurements to evaluate, for\neach pixel, the parameters necessary to make the trigger uniform over the whole\nfocal plane.\n", "  The TOTEM experiment has been designed to measure the total proton-proton\ncross section and to study the elastic and diffractive scattering at the LHC\nenergy. The measurement requires detecting protons at distances as small as 1\nmm from the beam center: TOTEM uses Roman Pots, movable beam pipe insertions,\nhosting silicon detectors. In the first period of LHC operation no relevant\nproblems were detected with Roman Pots retracted or inserted during special\nruns. However, when operating the LHC with high intensity beams, impedance\ninduced heating has been observed during the Roman Pots insertion. In order to\nbe compatible with the higher LHC beam current foreseen after the LS1, a new\nversion of the Roman Pot has been proposed and optimized with respect to the\nbeam coupling impedance. In this work we present the bench impedance\nmeasurements carried out on the new Roman Pot prototype. Single and double wire\nmeasurements, as well as probe measurements, were performed in order to detect\npossible harmful resonant modes. The laboratory setup has been as well\nsimulated with the help of CST Particle Studio in order to benchmark the\nmeasurement results. Measurements and simulations are in close agreement\nconfirming the equipment compatibility with the LHC requirements for safe\noperation.\n", "  In this paper, we present our numerical simulation results on the Stimulated\nBrillouin Scattering (SBS) with injection of an ordinary mode (O-mode)\nelectromagnetic wave (our pump wave) with frequencies 70 GHz and 110 GHz.\nSolving the Fourier transformed Vlasov equation in the velocity space, creates\na profile for distribution function. Time evolution of the distribution\nfunction is investigated as well. Considering an average density for plasma\nfusion (n_{0} ~ 10^{19} m^{-3}), we gain a profile for density. Then\ntwo-dimensional instability rate for SBS is obtained. So, the fluctuation of\ndistribution function affects density and again density affects instability\nrate. Increasing the incident light wave frequency causes the instability\ngrowth rate to decrease. Time evolution shows a clear damping for instability\nrate since the pump wave's energy is absorbed in plasma (plasma heating).\nFurthermore, changing Landau damping for ion acoustic waves (IAW) by changing\nion-to-electron temperature ratio is presented as well, because this damping is\nmore dominant in high temperatures.\n", "  The concept of the radio-frequency superconducting nanowire single-photon\ndetector (RF-SNSPD) allows frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) of the bias\nand readout lines of several SNSPDs. Using this method, a multi-pixel array can\nbe operated by only one feed line. Consequently, the system complexity as well\nas the heat load is significantly reduced. To allocate many pixels into a small\nbandwidth the quality factor of each device is crucial. In this paper, we\npresent an improved RF-SNSPD design. This new design enables a simple tuning of\nthe quality factor as well as the resonant frequency. With a two-pixel device\nwe have demonstrated the operation without crosstalk between the detectors and\nshowed the time, spatial and photon number resolution. Thereby a single pixel\nrequires only a bandwidth of 14 MHz.\n", "  Here we present a study of magnetism in \\CTO\\ anatase films grown by pulsed\nlaser deposition under a variety of oxygen partial pressures and deposition\nrates. Energy-dispersive spectrometry and transition electron microscopy\nanalyses indicate that a high deposition rate leads to a homogeneous\nmicrostructure, while very low rate or postannealing results in cobalt\nclustering. Depth resolved low-energy muon spin rotation experiments show that\nfilms grown at a low oxygen partial pressure ($\\approx 10^{-6}$ torr) with a\nuniform structure are fully magnetic, indicating intrinsic ferromagnetism.\nFirst principles calculations identify the beneficial role of low oxygen\npartial pressure in the realization of uniform carrier-mediated ferromagnetism.\nThis work demonstrates that Co:TiO$_2$ is an intrinsic diluted magnetic\nsemiconductor.\n", "  The magnetic ground state of the Eu$^{2+}$ moments in a series of\nEu(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ single crystals grown from the Sn flux has\nbeen investigated in detail by neutron diffraction measurements. Combined with\nthe results from the macroscopic properties (resistivity, magnetic\nsusceptibility and specific heat) measurements, a phase diagram describing how\nthe Eu magnetic order evolves with Co doping in\nEu(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ is established. The ground-state magnetic\nstructure of the Eu$^{2+}$ spins is found to develop from the A-type\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) order in the parent compound, via the A-type canted AFM\nstructure with some net ferromagnetic (FM) moment component along the\ncrystallographic $\\mathit{c}$ direction at intermediate Co doping levels,\nfinally to the pure FM order at relatively high Co doping levels. The ordering\ntemperature of Eu declines linearly at first, reaches the minimum value of\n16.5(2) K around $\\mathit{x}$ = 0.100(4), and then reverses upwards with\nfurther Co doping. The doping-induced modification of the indirect\nRuderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction between the Eu$^{2+}$ moments,\nwhich is mediated by the conduction $\\mathit{d}$ electrons on the (Fe,Co)As\nlayers, as well as the change of the strength of the direct interaction between\nthe Eu$^{2+}$ and Fe$^{2+}$ moments, might be responsible for the change of the\nmagnetic ground state and the ordering temperature of the Eu sublattice. In\naddition, for Eu(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$)$_{2}$As$_{2}$ single crystals with 0.10\n$\\leqslant$ $\\mathit{x}$ $\\leqslant$ 0.18, strong ferromagnetism from the Eu\nsublattice is well developed in the superconducting state, where a spontaneous\nvortex state is expected to account for the compromise between the two\ncompeting phenomena.\n", "  We develop a microscopic approach to the consistent construction of the\nkinetic theory of dilute weakly ionized gases of hydrogen-like atoms. The\napproach is based on the framework of the second quantization method in the\npresence of bound states of particles and the method of reduced description of\nrelaxation processes. Within the approach we developed the first-order\nperturbation theory over the weak interaction for a system of kinetic equations\nfor the Wigner distribution functions of free fermions of both kinds and their\nbound states, the hydrogen-like atoms. It is shown that the conditions of\nlow-temperature approximation, of the gas non-degeneracy and the approximation\nof weak interaction are realistic and can be met in a wide range of\ntemperatures and the densities of the studied system. We obtain dispersion\nequations for determining the frequency and wave attenuation coefficients in\ndilute weakly ionized gas of hydrogen-like atoms near the described equilibrium\nstate. In the two-level atom approximation it is shown that in the system there\nare longitudinal waves of matter polarization and transverse waves with the\nbehavior characteristic of plasmon polaritons. The expressions for the\ndependence of the frequency and the Landau damping coefficients on the wave\nvector for all branches of the oscillations detected, are obtained.\nQuantitative estimations of the characteristics of the elementary perturbations\nin the system on an example of a weakly ionized dilute gas of Na-23 atoms are\npresented. The possibility of using the results of the theory developed to\ndescribe the properties of a Bose condensate of photons in dilute weakly\nionized gas of hydrogen-like atoms is noted and the directions of its\ngeneralizations are discussed.\n", "  We show that maximally twisted mass fermions can be employed to regularize on\nthe lattice the fully unquenched QCD+QED theory with vanishing $\\theta$-term.\nWe discuss how the critical mass of the up and down quarks can be conveniently\ndetermined beyond the electroquenched approximation by imposing that certain\nsymmetries of continuum QCD+QED, which are broken by Wilson terms, get restored\nin the continuum limit. A mixed action setup is outlined that allows to extend\nbeyond the electroquenched approximation the computation (with only O($a^2$)\nartifacts) of the leading isospin breaking corrections to physical observables\nusing the RM123 method and (pure QCD) ETMC gauge ensembles with $N_f=2+1+1$\ndynamical quark flavours.\n", "  In this paper the $h$-adaptive partition-of-unity method and the $h$- and\n$hp$-adaptive finite element method are applied to partial differential\nequations arising in quantum mechanics, namely, the Schr\\\"odinger equation with\nCoulomb and harmonic potentials, and the Poisson problem. Implementational\ndetails of the partition-of-unity method related to enforcing continuity with\nhanging nodes and the degeneracy of the basis are discussed. The\npartition-of-unity method is equipped with an a posteriori error estimator,\nthus enabling implementation of error-controlled adaptive mesh refinement\nstrategies. To that end, local interpolation error estimates are derived for\nthe partition-of-unity method enriched with a class of exponential functions.\nThe results are the same as for the finite element method and thereby admit the\nusage of standard residual error indicators. The efficiency of the $h$-adaptive\npartition-of-unity method is compared to the $h$- and $hp$-adaptive finite\nelement method. The latter is implemented by adopting the analyticity estimate\nfrom Legendre coefficients. An extension of this approach to multiple solution\nvectors is proposed. Numerical results confirm the remarkable accuracy of the\n$h$-adaptive partition-of-unity approach. In case of the Hydrogen atom, the\n$h$-adaptive linear partition-of-unity method was found to be comparable to the\n$hp$-adaptive finite element method for the target eigenvalue accuracy of\n$10^{-3}$.\n", "  Electronic correlations were long suggested not only to be responsible for\nthe complexity of many novel materials, but also to form essential\nprerequisites for their intriguing properties. Electronic behavior of\niron-based superconductors is far from conventional, while the reason for that\nis not yet understood. Here we present a combined study of the electronic\nspectrum in the iron-based superconductor FeSe by means of angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). Both\nmethods in unison reveal strong deviations of the spectrum from single-electron\napproximation for the whole 3$d$ band of iron: not only the well separated\ncoherent and incoherent parts of the spectral weight are observed, but also a\nnoticeable dispersion of the lower Hubbard band (LHB) is clearly present. This\nway we demonstrate correlations of the most puzzling intermediate coupling\nstrength in iron superconductors.\n", "  Electron-positron annihilation line from a Galactic center direction was\ndiscovered by the balloon-borne germanium gamma-ray telescope, and confirmed by\nOSSE experiment of CGRO mission. Extensive observations by INTEGRAL observatory\npermit to determine properties of the annihilation line from Galactic bulge.\nPossible sources of $e^{+}$ already discussed are supernovae explosions,\nmicroquasars, gamma-ray bursts, tidal disruption events, activity near black\nhole of Sgr A*, $e^{+}$ generation by subrelativistic cosmic rays, or even dark\nmatter. One remarkable feature of the line emission is an absence of resolved\npoint like sources. Any model should take into account this feature. We\nconsider flares of low-mass stars as a possible cumulative $e^{+}$ source of\nthe observed annihilation line from the bulge. Our estimations show that\n$e^{+}$ production by numerous flaring stars in Galaxy bulge can be\nsignificant, or even the main source of $e^{+}$ responsible for the\nannihilation line observed from the central part of our Galaxy.\n", "  In this paper, we have investigated the role of different fluid parameters\nparticularly electromagnetic field and $f(R)$ corrections on the evolution of\ncylindrical compact object. We have explored the modified field equations,\nkinematical quantities and dynamical equations. An expression for the mass\nfunction has been found in comparison with the Misner-Sharp formalism in\nmodified gravity, after which different mass radius diagrams are drawn. The\ncoupled dynamical transport equation have been formulated to discuss the role\nof thermoinertial effects on the inertial mass density of the cylindrical\nrelativistic interior. Finally, we have presented a framework, according to\nwhich all possible solutions of the metric $f(R)$-Maxwell field equations\ncoupled with static fluid can be written through set of scalar functions. It is\nfound that modified gravity induced by Lagrangians $f(R)=\\alpha\nR^2,~f(R)=\\alpha R^2-\\beta R$ and $f(R)=\\frac{\\alpha R^2-\\beta R}{1+\\gamma R}$\nare likely to host more massive cylindrical compact objects with smaller radii\nas compared to GR.\n", "  The Snell phase effects on the propagation of optical beams through\ndielectric blocks have been matter of recent theoretical studies. The effects\nof this phase on the laser profiles have been tested in our experiment. The\ndata show an excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions confirming\nthe axial spreading modification and the transversal symmetry breaking. The\npossibility to set, by rotating the dielectric blocks, different configurations\nallows to recover the transversal symmetry. Based on this experimental\nevidence, dielectric blocks can be used as alternative optical tools to control\nthe beam profile.\n", "  It is shown that the Stone-von Neumann theorem is inapplicable to scattering\na quantum nonrelativistic particle on a one-dimensional \"short-range\" potential\nbarrier, since the unboundedness of the position operator plays here a crucial\nrole. The Shcr\\\"odinger representation associated with this process is\nreducible: long before and long after the scattering event the space of its\nasymptotes represents the direct sum of the subspaces of left and right\nasymptotes. There is a dichotomous-context-induced superselection rule (SSR),\nin which the role of a superselection operator is played by the Pauli matrix\n$\\sigma_3$ and the role of superselection (coherent) sectors is played by the\nabove subspaces. By the SSR any superposition of states from different coherent\nsectors is a mixed state, and splitting the incident wave packet into the\ntransmitted and reflected parts is nothing but a conversion of a pure state\ninto a mixed one. The average values of any observable can be defined only for\nthe transmission and reflection subprocesses. The former evolves within a\nsingle coherent sector of the Hilbert space, in the momentum representation;\nwhile the latter evolves within a single coherent sector of this space, in the\ncoordinate representation.\n", "  The equation of state of $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory is investigated in the\nframework of a moving reference frame. Results for the entropy density, the\npressure, the energy density, and the trace anomaly are presented for\ntemperatures ranging from 0 to 230 $T_c$, with $T_c$ the deconfinement\ntemperature. The entropy density is the primary observable that has been\nmeasured and form which the other thermodynamic quantities are obtained. At\nleast 4 different values of the lattice spacing have been considered at each\nphysical temperature in order to extrapolate to the continuum limit. The final\naccuracy is 0.5%, increasing to about 1% close to the phase transition. A\ndetailed comparison with the results available in the literature is discussed.\n", "  We present the scientific case for a future space-based telescope aimed at\nvery high spatial and temporal resolution imaging of the solar photosphere and\nchromosphere. Previous missions (e.g., HINODE, SUNRISE) have demonstrated the\npower of observing the solar photosphere and chromosphere at high spatial\nresolution without contamination from Earth's atmosphere. We argue here that\nincreased spatial resolution (from currently 70 km to 25 km in the future) and\nhigh temporal cadence of the observations will vastly improve our understanding\nof the physical processes controlling solar magnetism and its characteristic\nscales. This is particularly important as the Sun's magnetic field drives solar\nactivity and can significantly influence the Sun-Earth system. At the same time\na better knowledge of solar magnetism can greatly improve our understanding of\nother astrophysical objects.\n", "  We describe the quantum phases of interacting three component fermions in the\npresence of spin-orbit coupling, as well as linear and quadratic Zeeman fields.\nWe classify the emerging superfluid phases in terms of the loci of zeros of\ntheir quasi-particle excitation spectrum in momentum space, and we identify\nseveral Lifshitz-type topological transitions. In the particular case of\nvanishing quadratic Zeeman field, a quintuple point exists where four gapless\nsuperfluid phases with surface and line nodes converge into a fully gapped\nsuperfluid phase. Lastly, we also show that the simultaneous presence of\nspin-orbit and Zeeman fields transforms a momentum-independent scalar order\nparameter into an explicitly momentum-dependent tensor in the generalized\nhelicity basis.\n", "  The main subject studied in this dissertation is a multi-layered social\nnetwork (MSN) and its analysis. One of the crucial problems in multi-layered\nsocial network analysis is community extraction. To cope with this problem the\nCLECC measure (Cross Layered Edge Clustering Coefficient) was proposed in the\nthesis. It is an edge measure which expresses how much the neighbors of two\ngiven users are similar each other. Based on this measure the CLECC algorithm\nfor community extraction in the multi-layered social networks was designed. The\nalgorithm was tested on the real single-layered social networks (SSN) and\nmulti-layered social networks (MSN), as well as on benchmark networks from GN\nBenchmark (SSN), LFR Benchmark (SSN) and mLFR Benchmark (MSN) a special\nextension of LFR Benchmark, designed as a part of this thesis, which is able to\nproduce multi-layered benchmark networks. The second research problem\nconsidered in the thesis was group evolution discovery. Studies on this problem\nhave led to the development of the inclusion measure and the Group Evolution\nDiscovery (GED) method, which is designed to identify events between two groups\nin successive time frames in the social network. The method was tested on a\nreal social network and compared with two well-known algorithms regarding\naccuracy, execution time, flexibility and ease of implementation. Finally, a\nnew approach to prediction of group evolution in the social network was\ndeveloped. The new approach involves usage of the outputs of the GED method. It\nis shown, that using even a simple sequence, which consists of several\npreceding groups sizes and events, as an input for the classifier, the learned\nmodel can produce very good results also for simple classifiers.\n", "  It is recalled that closed (isolated) systems are essentially reversible\nwhilst open systems like the Earth, or living beings on it, are irreversible\nbecause they are not isolated. Earth and life irreversibility derives from the\nevolution of the universe, which is a consequence of its special initial\nconditions. It is stressed that, although relativity theory forbids that\ninformation travels faster than light, it does not forbid influences of an\nevent on its past light cone. Therefore the violation of Bell inequalities in\nloophole-free experiments is compatible with relativity theory. A correlation\nformula, alternative to Bell's, is proposed as the starting point for hidden\nvariables models fitting in relativity.\n", "  We consider a class of of massless gradient Gibbs measures, in dimension\ngreater or equal to three, and prove a decoupling inequality for these fields.\nAs a result, we obtain detailed information about their geometry, and the\npercolative and non-percolative phases of their level sets, thus generalizing\nresults obtained in arXiv:1202.5172, to the non-Gaussian case. Inequalities of\nsimilar flavor have also been successfully used in the study of random\ninterlacements, see arXiv:1010.1490, arXiv:1212.1605. A crucial aspect is the\ndevelopment of a suitable sprinkling technique, which relies on a particular\nrepresentation of the correlations in terms of a random walk in a dynamic\nrandom environment, due to Helffer and Sj\\\"{o}strand. The sprinkling can be\neffectively implemented by studying the Dirichlet problem for the corresponding\nPoisson equation, and quantifiying in how far a change in boundary condition\nalong a sufficiently \"small\" part of the boundary affects the solution. Our\nresults allow for uniformly convex potentials, and extend to non-convex\nperturbations thereof.\n", "  We investigate disorder relevance for the pinning of a renewal when the law\nof the random environment is in the domain of attraction of a stable law with\nparameter $\\gamma \\in (1,2)$. Assuming that the renewal jumps have power-law\ndecay, we determine under which condition the critical point of the system\nmodified by the introduction of a small quantity of disorder. In an earlier\nstudy of the problem, we have shown that the answer depends on the value of the\ntail exponent $\\alpha$ associated to the distribution of renewal jumps: when\n$\\alpha>1-\\gamma^{-1}$ a small amount of disorder shifts the critical point\nwhereas it does not when $\\alpha<1-\\gamma^{-1}$. The present paper is focused\non the boundary case $\\alpha=1-\\gamma^{-1}$. We show that a critical point\nshifts occurs in this case, and obtain an estimate for its intensity.\n", "  We detail the improvements made to the targeted offline search of Fermi-GBM\ndata for coincident signals to LIGO gravitational wave triggers. Description of\nthe changes are included, as well as comparisons between the ranking statistics\nand False Alarm Rate distributions for the search during LIGO O1 and O2.\n", "  We present a method for studying the detection of jets in high energy\nhadronic collisions using multiplicity detector in forward rapidities. Such a\nstudy enhances the physics scope of multiplicity detectors at forward\nrapidities in LHC. At LHC energies the jets may be produced with significant\ncross section in forward rapidities. A multi resolution wavelet analysis\ntechnique can locate the spatial position of jets due to its feature of\nspace-scale locality. The discrete wavelet proves to be very effective in\nprobing physics simultaneously at different locations in phase space and at\ndifferent scales to identify jet-like events. The key feature this analysis\nexploits is the difference in particle density in localized regions of the\ndetector due to jet-like and underlying events. We find that this method has a\nsignificant sensitivity towards detecting jet position and its size. The jets\ncan be found with the efficiency and purity of the order of 46%.\n", "  We demonstrate optically coupled nanomechanical resonators fabricated on\nsilicon-on-insulator. Silicon fin waveguides are used to control the dispersion\nof mechanical waves and engineer localized resonances by modulation of the fin\nproperties. A photonic crystal cavity is designed to localize laser light near\nthe fin and the mechanical motion is read out and modified by radiation\npressure back-action. We expect devices and systems made from similar\nstructures to enable co-integration of signal transduction and processing\ncapabilities via electronic, photonic, and phononic degrees freedom in a single\nscalable platform.\n", "  Chirality frustrates and shapes the assembly of flexible filaments in\nrope-like, twisted bundles and fibers by introducing gradients of both filament\nshape (i.e. curvature) and packing throughout the structure. Previous models of\nchiral filament bundle formation have shown that this frustration gives rise to\nseveral distinct morphological responses, including self-limiting bundle\nwidths, anisotropic domain (tape-like) formation and topological defects in the\nlateral inter-filament order. In this paper, we employ a combination of\ncontinuum elasticity theory and discrete filament bundle simulations to explore\nhow these distinct morphological responses compete in the broader phase diagram\nof chiral filament assembly. We show that the most generic model of bundle\nformation exhibits at least four classes of equilibrium structure --\nfinite-width, twisted bundles with isotropic and anisotropic shapes, with and\nwithout topological defects, as well as bulk phases of untwisted, columnar\nassembly (i.e. \"frustration escape\"). These competing equilibrium morphologies\nare selected by only a relatively small number of parameters describing\nfilament assembly: bundle surface energy, preferred chiral twist and stiffness\nof chiral filament interactions, and mechanical stiffness of filaments and\ntheir lateral interactions. Discrete filament bundle simulations test and\nverify continuum theory predictions for dependence of bundle structure (shape,\nsize and packing defects of 2D cross section) on these key parameters.\n"]}
